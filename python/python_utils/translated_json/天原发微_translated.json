  "full_translation": "**Heaven’s Origin Unfolded**\n\n*Scripture Title:* *Heaven’s Origin Unfolded*\n*Author:* Bao Yunlong of the Song Dynasty\n*Eighteen fascicles*\n*Source of the base text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiqing* Section\n*Collated edition:* Photographic reproduction from the *Wenyuan Pavilion* edition of the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n---\n\n**Heaven’s Origin Unfolded, Fascicle One**\n*Compiled by* Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Lu-Qi\n*Edited by* Xu Gu\n*Collated by* Fang Hui Wanli\n\n### The Supreme Polarity’s Primordial Name: *Zhongmo*\n\nThe Supreme Polarity (*Taiji*) resides within the soundless and scentless, yet it is the ultimate principle. It is the pivot of creation and transformation, the root and foundation of all things.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, the Supreme Polarity exists within them, like a hinge in a door or a knot in a garment—it grasps the essential framework. In the myriad things, the Supreme Polarity exists within them, like a root in a tree or a trunk in a plant—it establishes their fundamental basis.\n\nTo call it \"non-being\" (*wu*) is to say that within the vast and formless, the ten thousand images are already fully present. To call it \"being\" (*you*) is to say that in the primordial state, before even a single thing existed, it could not be exhaustively explained.\n\nAs principle (*li*), it is supremely lofty yet does not abandon the lowly; supremely subtle yet does not depart from the manifest; supremely refined yet does not mingle with *qi*; supremely numinous yet does not stagnate in things. Between Heaven and Earth, what has not yet been born is born, what has not yet emerged emerges—none escapes birth and death within its domain.\n\nLike the Northern Asterism, fixed in its place, while the circumpolar stars and the Seven Governors revolve around it day and night, what moves is all suspended from this, yet what makes it so has never itself moved.\n\nThe *Great Commentary on the Changes* states: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity.\" Master Zhu [Xi] replied to Cai Xishan: \"That which opens and closes, comes and goes without end, does so because it possesses this principle.\" With this principle, Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operates within them.\n\nTwo produces four, four produces eight. By the time of eight, three transformations occur in succession, and the Three Powers (*sancai*) become visible. The sages followed this, drawing the Eight Trigrams to embody the marvelous transformations of the *Changes* and determine fortune and misfortune.\n\nOnly afterward can this be expressed in writing; the word *Changes* (*Yi*) itself cannot be so expressed. *Yi* means \"transformation.\" The intermingling of *yin* and *yang*, the thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all emerge from this. This is what the Master [Confucius] meant by the \"formless *Changes*\"—speaking of transformation as formless yet possessing an ultimate principle. It encompasses both movement and stillness, the already-manifest and the not-yet-manifest.\n\nThe Supreme Polarity is the marvel of *xing* (nature) and *qing* (emotions), the principle of movement and stillness, the already-manifest and the not-yet-manifest. Within the Supreme Polarity, there is nothing but goodness. As for the three hundred eighty-four lines [of the *Yijing*], where good and evil appear, these arise only after the transformations of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThe *Comprehensive Record* states: \"Sincerity (*cheng*) is the non-doing of the Supreme Polarity; the incipient (*ji*) is the good and evil of *yin* and *yang*.\" The virtues—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—are the Five Phases (*wuxing*), all explained in terms of the Diagram.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity, which is the Great Void (*Taixu*).\" *Yin* and *yang* arise when the Great Void gathers into *qi*. Softness and hardness arise when *qi* gathers into form. Benevolence and righteousness are born from the Great Void, manifest in *qi* and form, and activated in consciousness.\n\nDivided into two, they become *yin* and *yang*. Divided into five, they become the Five Phases. Divided into the ten thousand affairs and things, all share this single origin, which is called *xing* (nature).\n\nNanxuan said: \"The Supreme Polarity is the name for the convergence of the ten thousand principles, the marvel of *xing* (nature).\" If one speaks only of *xing* and not of the Supreme Polarity, focusing solely on the not-yet-manifest, its functioning remains unseen. By calling it the Supreme Polarity, the marvel of *xing* becomes apparent.\n\nViewed from the perspective of individual endowment, it is called *ming* (destiny). Viewed from the perspective of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, it is called *li* (principle). Each of the ten thousand things possesses its own principle—this is \"one Supreme Polarity in each thing.\" The ten thousand principles all emerge from a single source—this is \"one Supreme Polarity encompassing all things.\"\n\nThis fool says: The \"Polarity\" (*ji*) is omnipresent. The \"Polarity of the People\" (*minji*) has the meaning of convergence; the \"Northern Polarity\" (*beiji*) has the meaning of a pivot; the \"August Polarity\" (*huangji*) has the meaning of a standard. To call it the \"Supreme Polarity\" (*Taiji*) is to speak of the source. This principle alone stands prior to the Two Modes (*yin-yang*) and the Five Phases, and operates within them.\n\nThough it has no form of convergence, it is in truth the convergence of the ten thousand things. Though it has no form of a pivot, it is in truth the pivot of the ten thousand things. Though it has no form of a standard, it is in truth the standard of the ten thousand things.\n\nMaster Zhou said: \"Non-polar (*wuji*) yet Supreme Polarity.\" This fool notes: Master Cheng said this sentence expresses the principle of \"the vast and formless, where the ten thousand images are already fully present.\" Cai Jieqi said: \"This clarifies the statement in the *Changes* that 'the *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity,' revealing the true reality of the Non-polar and the insight gained from the Master’s single word on the *Changes*.\" Those who consider it an arbitrary addition are mistaken. Here, I cite six statements from Master Zhu to explicate this sentence.\n\nThose that take the Supreme Polarity as their subject are three:\n1. Before images and numbers take form, the principle is already present.\n2. Before Heaven and Earth existed, this principle was ultimately present.\n3. The Non-polar (*wuji*) merely states that in the beginning, there was originally not a single thing—only this principle, which then gives rise to movement and stillness, producing *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThose that take *yin* and *yang* as their subject are also three:\n1. Viewed from the perspective of *yin* and *yang*, the Supreme Polarity resides within them. Today, some say that above *yin* and *yang* there exists another formless and shadowless entity called the Supreme Polarity—this is incorrect.\n2. The Supreme Polarity is simply the principle of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things, each of which contains a Supreme Polarity.\n3. It is not that there is something separate from *yin* and *yang*; rather, within *yin* and *yang*, one points to their fundamental substance, speaking of it without mingling it with *yin* and *yang*.\n\nWhen speaking of the Supreme Polarity in terms of the Supreme Polarity, it exists prior to *yin* and *yang*, before *yin* and *yang* have arisen. When speaking of the Supreme Polarity in terms of the generation of *yin* and *yang*, it exists within *yin* and *yang*, after *yin* and *yang* have arisen. To say that beyond *yin* and *yang* there exists a separate Supreme Polarity is mistaken.\n\nThose who insistently regard it as their master fall inevitably into the error of Liezi’s \"neither arising nor transforming.\" Those who cling solely to the claim that the Supreme Polarity exists within *yin* and *yang* remain blind to where the Great Root truly lies.\n\nSome say: before *yang* there is *yin*, and before *yin* there is *yang*. To speak of it in terms of *yin* and *yang* not yet arisen may raise doubts. Yet if one takes the moment just before the first stirring of *yang* and calls it the state before *yin* and *yang* have arisen, this may also be acceptable. Though *yin* and *yang* have not yet arisen, the principle that generates *yin* and *yang* is already fully present in the human heart as the \"center before arousal\"—this is collectively named the Supreme Polarity.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The Supreme Polarity is what points to the root of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things; the Non-Polar is what reveals the wondrousness of the soundless and scentless. Because it has no vessel or form, yet the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things are all contained within it, it is called the Non-Polar. And because the Supreme Polarity encompasses the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things yet has no vessel or form, it is called the Supreme Polarity, which is fundamentally non-polar. It exists before there are things, yet it is never absent after things come to be. It is said to be beyond *yin* and *yang*, yet it never fails to operate within *yin* and *yang*. If one speaks of it as pervading the entire body, present everywhere without exception, then there is nothing to be said of sound, scent, influence, or trace. Its loftiness reaches the Non-Polar, and the subtlety of the Supreme Polarity truly does not depart from the inquiries of daily life.\n\nHe also said: \"The bearing of high Heaven\" speaks of the Non-Polar within the realm of existence. \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" speaks of existence within the realm of the Non-Polar. The Non-Polar describes the wondrousness of the soundless and scentless; the Supreme Polarity names the ultimate perfection of this principle. Tracing downward from the Non-Polar and Supreme Polarity, the ten thousand things each attain their proper place, and the great and small are fixed in measure—each thing possesses a Supreme Polarity. Tracing upward from the Supreme Polarity, which is fundamentally non-polar, the ten thousand things are one, and the one is truly the ten thousand parts—all things share a single Supreme Polarity in their totality. Though the two *qi* and five phases give rise to humans and things, tangled and intertwined in endless transformations, the Supreme Polarity moves within them, inherently ordered and structured, not a chaotic void. Thus, when something is sensed externally, the center responds internally; whatever one encounters before the eyes is this principle. Great and small, joy and sorrow...\n\nI heard from my teacher: Zhou Dunyi’s phrase \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" is a forward expression; \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" is a reverse expression. \"The bearing of high Heaven, soundless and scentless\" is like Zhou’s \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity.\" If one were to reverse the lines of the *Odes* and say, \"Soundless and scentless, the bearing of high Heaven,\" how would this not also be acceptable? The phrase \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" does not mean that the Non-Polar is placed above the Supreme Polarity. Xiangshan refused to acknowledge the phrase \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" and attacked only the first line, pointlessly engaging in contentious debate. If I had met Xiangshan, I would have dared to ask the late learner, still unenlightened: \"Please show me the Supreme Polarity.\" Xiangshan would surely have become furious: \"The Supreme Polarity is a formless thing, the fundamental principle upon which the great earth is rooted. How could you bring it forth to look at? I have nothing to present, and you have nothing to see—this is the Non-Polar.\" Thus, Zhou Dunyi’s \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" and \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" are truly unassailable discussions for all time.\n\nHe also said: From the Supreme Polarity to the transformation and generation of the ten thousand things, it is all but a single cycle. In the second cycle, Zhou Dunyi separated out a circle above to show the supremely undifferentiated principle of the Supreme Polarity in its formless state. This cycle alone has existed since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, endlessly revolving within it. Bestowed within each of the ten thousand things, the principle of Heaven is complete, neither borrowing from nor encroaching upon others. The entire body of the Supreme Polarity is wholly present within this Non-Polar, and the two and five phases wondrously unite and congeal. Thus it is said: Every person possesses the Supreme Polarity, and every thing possesses the Supreme Polarity—all is naturally so. The difference between humans and things lies solely in the endowment of *qi*. Master Zhu’s explanation of the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity Unfolding* first shows people their origin, for only humans possess it. The subsequent stages show the foundation of the human Dao, enabling one to understand what makes a human human, a sage a sage, and why the noble and the petty each have their differing endowments of *qi*.\n\nSome say: The first part of the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity* resembles a chessboard, while the latter part resembles a person playing chess. I say: The upper circle represents the nature of Heaven and Earth; the lower circle, divided into *yin* and *yang*, contains the nature of *qi*-endowment. Master Shao said: The Dao is the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu said: This refers to the natural principle of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things. I say: The Dao is the Supreme Polarity—there are not two principles. Some claim that the Dao is a separate, suspended entity existing prior to the Supreme Polarity, but then the Dao and the Supreme Polarity would be two. How could the Supreme Polarity exist outside the Dao? In terms of its all-pervading movement, it is called the Dao; in terms of its ultimate perfection, it is called the Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is the undifferentiated Dao; it is the Polarity from which all principles branch. Wherever these branching principles extend, there is the Dao. Like piercing the nose of an ox or bridling the head of a horse, it follows wherever it flows—how could the Polarity and the Dao be two principles?\n\nHe also said: The heart-mind is the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu said: This refers to the principle that humans receive as the master of their bodies. I say: The heart-mind is a spiritually luminous entity, the dwelling of human nature. The Polarity is the principle of utmost goodness, the form of human nature. When the heart-mind governs principle, the undifferentiated Supreme Polarity emerges. In responding to the ten thousand affairs, each thing possesses its own Polarity.\n\nThus Master You said: In stillness without thought, before the myriad virtues arise, this is the Ultimateless. When this heart-mind is luminously clear, its spiritual source undimmed, this is the Supreme Polarity. If within stillness a single thought stirs, then movement and quiescence become yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Fu Xi composed the *Yi* beginning with the single line; King Wen expanded the *Yi* beginning with \"Qian's origination.\" They never spoke of the Supreme Polarity, yet Confucius did. Confucius commented on the *Yi* beginning with the Supreme Polarity, yet never spoke of the Ultimateless—until Master Zhou did. Fu Xi and King Wen explained from yin-yang downward; Confucius, in turn, revealed the Supreme Polarity from above yin-yang. Cai Jitong said: \"Had Heaven not given birth to Confucius, all ages would have been as a long night.\" Heaven first gave birth to Fu Xi and King Wen; had Confucius not come after, three thousand years would have been lost. Had the Cheng brothers and Master Zhou not come after, it would have been the same.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Without Fu Xi and King Wen’s *Yi*, there would be no *Yi*; without the Master’s discourse on the Supreme Polarity, people would not know the *Yi*’s root. Knowing the root, without Master Zhou’s discourse on the Ultimateless, people would not know the root of the Supreme Polarity. The *Yi* is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity’s root is the Ultimateless. Once the subtlety of tracing things to their origin is made clear, the hearts of people across myriad ages will all know where to find their ultimate refuge.\n\nMaster Zhu once said: Master Zhou’s explanation of the Ultimateless and the Supreme Polarity is most excellent. He also cited Master Cheng’s discussion of Zhang Zai’s \"pure emptiness, one greatness,\" which leads people astray if parsed too finely—his meaning was profound. I have studied the earlier masters, consulted teachers and friends, and arrived at this understanding:\n\nThe *Yi* contains the phrase \"there is the Supreme Polarity.\" After Fu Xi and King Wen, none but Confucius could have articulated it. After Confucius, for fifteen hundred years, no one fully grasped it—until Shao Kangjie first recognized it as the root of the *Yi*, and Master Lianxi (Zhou Dunyi) first elucidated its meaning through the Ultimateless. The sages and worthies transmitted the Dao, gradually clarifying it to its most intimate essence.\n\nFrom antiquity past to eternity future, without this single phrase in the *Yi*, one might add the word \"change\" (*yi*) to the Supreme Polarity, thereby revealing the Supreme Polarity’s rootedness—not like the heterodox, who fall into emptiness and nothingness. This word *yi* is most subtle and profound; it is the wondrous locus of yin-yang transformation, what is called the *Yi* without form. It exists before the Two Modes and the myriad transformations, yet embodies their essence. Though not yet manifest as yin and yang, it is the source from which the Supreme Polarity emerges. To clarify its non-being is not to speak of emptiness, but to point to the most real principle within. Thus it is called *yi*, called \"being,\" called the Supreme Polarity—each word has its proper place. The Master feared people would not understand this principle, so he stated it clearly. To view the *Yi* merely as a book is to miss the mark entirely.\n\nMaster Zhou feared people would not grasp the principle of the Supreme Polarity, so he said: \"Ultimateless and yet Supreme Polarity.\" By using the two words \"Ultimateless,\" he explained the single word *yi* in the *Yi*, thereby clarifying the original meaning of the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu, in turn, feared people would separate the phrase \"Ultimateless and yet Supreme Polarity\" into two, so he said: \"Each thing possesses its own Supreme Polarity.\" Knowing this, one understands that the two qi, the Five Phases, and the thousand transformations and myriad changes constitute the *Yi*. Yet within each thing resides a naturally complete and undifferentiated Supreme Polarity that cannot be altered. This principle fills the cosmos, present everywhere—people simply fail to recognize it.\n\n\"Production and reproduction is called *yi*\": this is the *yi* of \"there is the Supreme Polarity\" in the *Yi*. From this arise the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams. Not only within the *Yi* as a whole, but in every instance—whether in yin-yang, in male and female, in the human heart, or among the myriad kinds—each unfolds according to this principle, which cannot be altered. This is why the *Yi* generates yin and yang, yet transcends yin and yang. The *Yi* cannot be confined to yin-yang as its essence, nor can it be equated with the changes of yin-yang. Yin-yang is not the *Yi*; yin-yang’s transformations arise from the formless *Yi*. Thus I say: \"There is the Supreme Polarity in the *Yi*,\" for the *Yi* is without form.\n\n\"Without thought, without action\" is the root of the *Yi*. \"Establishing positions, arranging ranks, the *Yi* is established and enacted\"—this is the function of the *Yi*. In humans, it is called *yi*; in humans, it is called nature—none is apart from the one Supreme Polarity. The *Yi* of the Master (Confucius) speaks of \"there is\"; the *Yi* of Master Zhou speaks of \"without.\" Shaozi’s (Shao Yong) earlier teachings may follow a different path. Later generations, confused by theories of the *Yi*’s \"Great Beginning\" and \"Great Simplicity,\" lost the meaning of the single word *yi*. Those who take \"there is a thing formed in solitude\" as the sole transmission of the Supreme Polarity come close to the Master’s words, yet still fall short.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll One, concludes.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Supreme Polarity (*Taiji*), wherein movement and stillness give rise to the division of yin and yang. The Supreme Polarity is without form, while yin and yang possess *qi*. Movement and stillness are *qi*; principle (*li*) rides upon *qi* and acts through it. The transformations of odd and even, the mutual engagement of female and male—those who obtain the yang *qi* follow the *qian* Dao and become male; those who obtain the yin *qi* follow the *kun* Dao and become female. *Qi* gathers to form shape, shapes interact and *qi* responds; yin and yang interweave and intermingle—this is the meaning of the *Yi*.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, there is only the ceaseless cycling of movement and stillness; beyond this, there is nothing more. Someone asked: \"Yang moves and serves as function; yin is still and serves as substance. Now Master Zhou speaks of the Supreme Polarity, saying that movement generates yang—yet he begins from the state of movement, so function precedes substance. Moreover, what was it like before movement began?\" I reply: Before movement began, it was principle—what is called 'the Non-Ultimate and yet the Supreme Polarity.' Principle should not be spoken of in terms of movement and stillness. Before movement, it is stillness; before stillness, it is movement; before movement, it is stillness again. Thus, principle has no opposite; it cannot be described in terms of movement and stillness. Rather, principle is revealed through movement and stillness.\n\nAs for Master Shao’s saying, \"Function arises before heaven and earth,\" and Master Zhu’s saying, \"The function of the Supreme Polarity is what enables its activity\"—both refer to the aspect of function. The deeper meaning of \"movement generates yang\" is that nothing can be said of what lies beyond it. Master Zhou said: \"The Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang. When movement reaches its limit, it returns to stillness, and stillness generates yin. When stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes are established.\" Master Zhu’s commentary on this chapter is most subtle and wondrous. He said: \"The Supreme Polarity’s possession of movement and stillness is the flowing forth of Heaven’s Mandate—this is what is meant by 'the Dao of one yin and one yang.' Sincerity (*cheng*) is the root of the sage, the end and beginning of things, and the Dao of the Mandate. Its movement is the unfolding of sincerity; what follows it is the goodness by which the myriad things are endowed with their beginning. Its stillness is the return of sincerity; what completes it is nature, by which the myriad things each rectify their natures and lives. Movement reaches its limit and becomes stillness; stillness reaches its limit and returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other—this is the flowing forth of the Mandate without cease. Movement generates yang; stillness generates yin. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes are established. Their division has a definite principle that does not shift.\"\n\nThe Supreme Polarity is the wondrousness of what is so of itself. Movement and stillness are the mechanism it rides upon. The Supreme Polarity is above form—it is the Dao. Yin and yang are below form—they are the vessels. I say: The Supreme Polarity is principle; movement and stillness are *qi*. The mechanism it rides upon is the bearing and carrying of movement and stillness. This principle rests upon *qi*, unaware that it moves and then is still, is still and then moves again. Thus it is said: The Supreme Polarity is like a person; movement and stillness are like a horse. The horse carries the person; the person rides the horse. The horse goes out and comes in; the person goes out and comes in with it. Therefore, the Supreme Polarity rides upon this *qi* of movement and stillness to generate yin and yang. When it moves, it is the Supreme Polarity of yang; when it is still, it is the Supreme Polarity of yin. Viewed from the perspective of yin and yang, yin and yang exist only within the Supreme Polarity. To say that the Supreme Polarity exists within yin and yang is also acceptable—yet if one clings to fixed forms, one may flow into movement without stillness or sink into stillness without movement, and things will not flow smoothly.\n\nThe spirit (*shen*) does not depart from form yet is not confined by form. Within movement there is stillness; within stillness there is movement—this is what is meant by the spirit’s wondrousness in the myriad things. Proceeding upward from the Five Phases and the two *qi*, one finds the root in the oneness of the Supreme Polarity. Movement and stillness, yang and yin—this is the origin of the myriad things’ single nature. Proceeding downward from the two *qi* and the Five Phases, one finds them dispersed into the ten thousand things. Stillness and movement, yin and yang—one reality divides into ten thousand parts, and the Mandate flows forth. In stillness, the Supreme Polarity merges and returns to oneness; in movement, the Supreme Polarity opens and scatters into the ten thousand things.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Does this mean the Supreme Polarity is also subject to division?\" I reply: It is fundamentally one Supreme Polarity. The myriad things each receive their allotment, and each in turn possesses a complete Supreme Polarity. It is like the moon in the sky—there is only one. Yet when it scatters upon rivers and lakes, its reflection appears everywhere. Can one say the moon is divided? One root, ten thousand branches; ten thousand branches, one root—there is no doubt about this.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Movement and stillness have no beginning; yin and yang have no origin. Movement generates yang, yet originally it was stillness. Above stillness, there must be movement. Before movement, there is stillness. Pushing upward, its beginning is without end—this is the Dao of Heaven. Beginning with yin, completing with yang, rooted in stillness, flowing into movement—this is the Dao of Humanity. Yet yang returns to its root in stillness, and stillness in turn is rooted in movement—its movement and stillness also have no beginning.\" He also said: \"Movement and stillness serve as each other’s root—the word 'root' most deserves careful consideration. There is movement and stillness that are already fixed and visible, and there is movement and stillness that are not yet fixed and not yet visible—these are the root of movement and stillness. This word 'root' is difficult to explain. To say that movement is rooted in stillness and stillness is rooted in movement is merely to speak of their mutual exchange and alternation, without distinguishing host and guest. The meaning is not fully conveyed; Master Zhu’s explanation is more rounded and lively.\"\n\nHe said: \"*Yuan* and *heng* are the unfolding of sincerity in movement. *Li* and *zhen* are the return of sincerity in stillness. *Yuan* is the constancy of movement, rooted in stillness. *Zhen* is the substance of stillness, manifest in movement—this is what is meant by *zhen*. It is how the myriad things complete their ends and begin anew. Thus, one cannot stand as a person without movement. The ultimate (*ji*) is fundamentally rooted in stillness; when what is manifest in movement is always properly regulated, it does not lose its original stillness. Stillness is how nature is established; movement is how the Mandate flows forth.\"\n\nIndeed, in every movement and stillness, the Mandate flows forth. Yet what courses through movement and stillness is the constancy of nature. Thus it is said: \"The constancy of the Limitless.\" This encompasses movement and stillness, and speaks of the equilibrium before activation—when expressed in terms of stillness, it seems to point to *zhen* as the root of movement and stillness.\n\nIn my humble view: movement generates yang, yet it does not move of itself. Rooted in the Supreme Ultimate, it moves forth to bestow upon the myriad things. Stillness generates yin, yet it does not still itself. Rooted in the Supreme Ultimate, it enters to rectify the nature and Mandate of each. Thus, the Supreme Ultimate is the root of Heaven and Earth, governing the qi of yin and yang, movement and stillness, to enact the power of generating and completing the myriad things. As its root, how could this be lightly spoken of?\n\nIt is further said: Like a hundred-foot tree, from root to branch and leaf, all is one continuous whole, indivisible. To treat movement and stillness as two separate matters is to gradually impose an artificial arrangement. The Supreme Ultimate is like a tree growing upward: first dividing into branches and trunk, then further producing flowers and leaves, endlessly generating. When it comes to bearing fruit, within it lies the principle of ceaseless generation. As it generates outward, there emerge limitless Supreme Ultimates. Without pause, it continues until the fruit is formed, at which point it naturally halts for a time. The *Book of Changes* states: \"In the beginning and ending of the myriad things, nothing surpasses *Gen*.\" *Gen* signifies the meaning of growth and rest. Creation naturally operates thus—how could it depend on human arrangement? All follows the principle of root and branch as one continuous whole.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Movement and stillness also constitute the Two Modes. One is *bianyi* (transformation), which is the flowing aspect; the other is *jiaoyi* (interchange), which is the correlative aspect. Movement and stillness generate yin and yang; continuing goodness and completing nature are the flowing aspect. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established—this is the correlative aspect. The movement of the Supreme Ultimate is the flowing aspect. When movement stills, it becomes the correlative of yin and yang. In correlation, it moves again to become flowing. Like the alternation of cold and heat, one is horizontal, the other vertical. Flowing returns to stillness and becomes correlation, as in Heaven and Earth, the four directions: east yang, west yin, south yang, north yin. Correlation is the substance; flowing is the function. The substance is still, and the function is dynamic—these two aspects of movement and stillness are why transformation is inexhaustible.\n\nWhat is called *bianyi* refers to yang transforming into yin, yin transforming into yang, old yang transforming into young yin, old yin transforming into young yang. This pertains to the methods of divination, such as the alternation of contraction and extension. What is called *jiaoyi* refers to yang interchanging with yin, yin interchanging with yang, as in the hexagram images where Heaven and Earth take their positions.\n\nIt is further said: After Mencius, no one understood nature. Beginning with Master Lianxi, who spoke of the uneven transformations of movement and stillness, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, the Cheng brothers thereby deduced the nature of qi and disposition. Before a person is born, only this principle exists. Upon receiving this principle and coming to life, it is then infused as nature. The nature of Heaven and Earth is purely this principle without admixture; when it reaches the realm of yin and yang and the Five Phases, it becomes qi and disposition. Speaking of principle and qi together, there arise differences in clarity and turbidity, thickness and thinness. Thus it is said: \"The Five Natures are stirred and good and evil diverge.\" Nature belongs to the formless realm and is entirely the heavenly principle. Qi belongs to the formed realm and is the sediment. As for physical form, it is the most turbid sediment of all.\n\nIt is further said: All people possess the principle of movement and stillness, yet they commonly lose it in movement. The sage fully embodies the virtue of movement and stillness, yet always roots it in stillness. The two words \"movement\" and \"stillness\" are correlative, a natural principle of Heaven. Without movement as its counterpart, stillness cannot be called stillness. Without stillness as its counterpart, movement cannot be called movement. Yet the movement of ordinary people flows into movement without stillness; their stillness sinks into stillness without movement. Thus, desires stir, emotions prevail, profit and harm contend, and they follow their inclinations like a rushing stream—scarcely different from birds and beasts. Only the sage is not thus. In movement, the principle of stillness is never lost; in stillness, the principle of movement never ceases. Therefore, their conduct is centered, their dwelling is upright, their actions are benevolent, and their judgments are righteous. In every movement and stillness, nothing fails to be complete. In the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate, nothing is lacking. Thus, what was previously called the stirring of desires, the prevailing of emotions, and the contention of profit and harm is settled here.\n\nBefore reaching this state, one cultivates it. Vigilance, apprehension, and reverence in stillness are constantly maintained—this is why the noble person is auspicious. Without understanding this and acting contrary to it, indulging in depravity and excess without restraint—this is why the petty person is inauspicious.\n\nMaster Shao said: Heaven is born of movement; Earth is born of stillness. At the beginning of movement, yang is born. At the extreme of movement, yin is born. At the beginning of stillness, softness is born. At the extreme of stillness, hardness is born. Within yin and yang, there are further yin and yang, hence the Greater Yin, Greater Yang, Lesser Yin, and Lesser Yang. Within hardness and softness, there are further hardness and softness, hence the Greater Hard, Greater Soft, Lesser Hard, and Lesser Soft.\n\nIn my humble observation: Master Shao’s explanation proceeds from the Supreme Ultimate to movement and stillness, thus \"One generates Two.\" From movement and stillness, yin and yang, hardness and softness divide, and \"Two generates Four.\" Further dividing into greater and lesser, \"Four generates the Eight Trigrams.\" From this, the numbers are drawn, and from this, the principles are extended—Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things cannot escape. Within the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate, all is so clearly ordered. Former scholars said of Kangjie that he saw clearly at the point where yin and yang intersect—how true are these words.\n\n**Movement and Stillness**\nThis chapter speaks of movement being rooted in stillness. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—all flow without ceasing.\n\nYet it constantly takes stillness as its root. Without night, day would be indistinct. Without winter, spring, summer, and autumn could not bring forth growth and fruition. Just as one who engages in affairs all day must rest briefly to restore vitality, so too if the four seasons had no winter and only endless growth, the primal *qi* would eventually be exhausted. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Closing the door is called *Kun*; preceding the opening of the door is called *Qian*—this is movement arising from stillness.\" From the Summer Solstice, *Kun* proceeds with one yin moving rightward, and the myriad things follow it inward, thus it is called \"closing.\" From the Winter Solstice, *Qian* proceeds with one yang moving leftward, and the myriad things follow it outward, thus it is called \"opening.\" *Kun* closes, and yang transforms into yin; *Qian* opens, and yin transforms into yang. Thus, one closing and one opening are called \"transformation.\" Closing recedes, opening advances—endless transformations. In a year, this is cold and heat; in a day, this is night and day; in a person, this is the cycle of life and death. Without stillness, there is no movement. Is this not why the world takes *Kun* as its beginning?\n\nThough yin begins to arise at the Summer Solstice, it is not until the sixth yin line of *Wei* stands alone that one can speak of \"stillness reaching its extreme and giving rise to movement.\" The *Appended Remarks* of the *Book of Changes* says: \"Without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under Heaven.\" Master Cheng said: \"The *zhong* ('center') refers to utter stillness; the *he* ('harmony') refers to its responsiveness that penetrates all things. In its stillness, there is no moment when it does not respond; in its responsiveness, there is no moment when it is not still. This is the full embodiment of Heaven’s mandate and the utmost correctness of the human heart.\" Before it is aroused, one sees the substance of its responsiveness; after it is aroused, one sees the function of its stillness. The human heart and the principle of Heaven are one.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Between one movement and one stillness lies the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity!\" Yang opens and moves; yin closes and is still—this is one movement and one stillness. Not enslaved by movement, not bound by stillness, neither movement nor stillness yet governing both—this is the space between one movement and one stillness.\n\nSome say: The *Canon of Supreme Mystery* speaks of yang *qi* concealed within the chamber of *Huangzhong*—truly, it is present in all things. *Xin* (\"trust\") is nothing other than sincerity. Master Zhou’s *Comprehensive Discourse* says: \"*Yuan heng* ('origination and flourishing') is the unfolding of sincerity; *li zhen* ('benefit and perseverance') is the return of sincerity.\" Between one unfolding and one return lies a principle of true reality. This is likely the *zhen* (\"perseverance\") of *yuan heng li zhen*. What follows *zhen* is *li*; what precedes *zhen* is *yuan*. From *li* to *zhen*, the subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is stored and concealed here. From *zhen* to *yuan*, the subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is released and expressed here. To be upright and firmly sincere, unwavering and unerring—this is what is meant by \"endless transformations, yet the true reality of *zhen* lies here.\" The subtlety of *Wuji* (\"Without Ultimate\") and *Taiji* (\"Supreme Ultimate\") thus pervades the boundary between Heaven and humanity. The sage employs this principle, taking stillness as the foundation for establishing humanity. The ultimate truth lies precisely here. To call it \"the utmost subtlety\" is to emphasize that it cannot be captured in words or form. This subtlety is the great unfolding of creation.\n\nWhen movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness, this is death; when stillness reaches its extreme and returns to movement, this is life. When yang reaches its extreme and generates yin, this is transformation; when yin reaches its extreme and generates yang, this is change. One who can recognize the space between one movement and one stillness can thereby understand transformation, change, life, and death.\n\nIt is also said: Before *Wuji*, yin contains yang; after the appearance of images, yang divides yin. Master Zhu said: From *Gou* to *Kun* is yin containing yang; from *Fu* to *Qian* is yang dividing yin. Between *Fu* and *Gou* lies *Wuji*. From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is the time before *Wuji*. Master Zhu said: \"This merely describes the cyclical meaning of the diagram. When *Kun*’s yin has gathered to its utmost, and *Fu*’s yang is contained but not yet manifest, this is the stillness of its original state. It does not oppose movement but is the root of movement and stillness.\" Former scholars said: \"The stillness that does not oppose movement is *Wuji* and *Taiji*.\" At the time of utmost stillness, there is only the capacity for knowing and perceiving, without any object of knowledge or perception. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to pure *Kun*, the image of no yang, yet possessing the utmost *zhen*. The indestructible principle resides within it. If we discuss the *Fu* hexagram, however, we must consider it as having objects of knowledge and perception—it cannot be conflated with the former.\n\nMaster Shao’s words—\"Where the first yang stirs, before the myriad things are born\"—likely refer to this idea. Viewed in terms of the human heart, this is the moment between desire stirring and not yet stirring. It is like the alarm and compassion felt when a child falls into a well—at this moment, this feeling can only be perceived with a mind empty of distractions and thoughts settled in stillness.\n\nNow, let us examine the diagram by extending it left and right. The right side of the diagram pertains to yin, which governs closing. Within yin lies yang—this refers to the movement from *Xun* waning to *Kun* gathering, the subtlety of stillness. This is the time before *Wuji*, when yin contains yang. The left side of the diagram pertains to yang, which governs opening. Yang departs and divides yin—this refers to the movement from *Zhen* growing to *Qian* dividing. This is the time after images appear, when yang divides yin. *Qian* generates one yin, thus it is said: \"The father gives birth to the eldest daughter, becoming *Gou*.\" *Kun* generates one yang, thus it is said: \"The mother conceives the eldest son, becoming *Fu*.\" This unites *Qian*’s yang and *Kun*’s yin, discussing the entire diagram as one. If we speak solely of *Wuji*, it resides only between *Fu* and *Gou*—we cannot loosely refer to it as existing after the appearance of images. Thus it is said: \"From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is the time before *Wuji*.\" It is also said: \"Between *Fu* and *Gou* lies *Wuji*.\" What does this mean? It is without movement or stillness yet contains movement and stillness; without yin or yang yet contains yin and yang. There is such a principle, yet no sign of its advance. Without sound or scent, utterly subtle and wondrous—this is what Master Zhou meant by \"*Wuji* and yet *Taiji*.\" It cannot be fully described in words.\n\nSuddenly, at midnight, a single clap of thunder—\nten thousand doors and a thousand gates open in succession.\nIf you recognize that within this lies the primordial image,\nyou may behold Fuxi himself before you.\nMaster Zhu truly grasped this.\n\nIt is also said: \"Primordiality has two aspects.\nThat which gives birth to the beginning of Heaven and Earth is *Taiji*.\nThat which gives birth to the beginning of the myriad things is the root of life.\"\nReturning to the root in the precelestial, reverting to stillness, is called *Kun*.\nIn a single day, this is the hour of *hai*.\nIn a single year, this is the tenth month.\nIn a single epoch, this is *Taiji*—\nthe moment before movement, when there exists an unformed state.\n\nIn the postcelestial, yang stirs within to become *Fu*.\nIn a single day, this is the midst of *zi*.\nIn a single year, this is the winter solstice.\nIn a single epoch, this is the beginning of *Taiji*.\nDiscussing *Fu* in terms of hexagram qi, it is also the precelestial—\nthis is to observe the one epoch spanning ten thousand ages.\n\nThe winter solstice is the first of the primordial unity of Heaven.\nThe spring equinox is the second of the primordial duality of things.\nThe first is the essence of primordiality.\nThe second is the function of primordiality.\n\nThat which first closes and then opens is spring.\nThat which is purely open is summer.\nThat which first opens and then closes is autumn.\nWinter is closure without sound—\nthough it is the end of storage, it is truly the beginning of generation.\n\"Primordial and then smooth, flourishing, and firm\"—\nstorage is completed in constancy.\nIf closure is secure and dense, then spring’s yang will unfold and spread,\nsetting the norm for the entire year, for the workings of creation truly begin here.\nThus, if winter is warm and without frost or snow,\nthe following year’s five grains will not ripen,\nprecisely because the yang qi has been prematurely dispersed.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Within stillness there is movement—\nthis reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"\nIt is like a single point of light in profound darkness.\nWhen the three yang are abundant, the myriad things flourish.\nAt this time, one sees only the flourishing of things,\nnot their heart.\nOnly when the myriad things have not yet arisen,\nall is clear and still—\nthe one yang, the heart of the generation of things,\nstirs beneath accumulated yin,\nconcealed and unable to remain hidden.\nThus, the heart of Heaven and Earth is visible here.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The heart of Heaven does not change or shift.\"\nThis is precisely how it is, year after year, month after month, day after day,\nwithout the slightest deviation.\n\nI have said before: In *Fu*, the one yang stirs beneath *Kun*—\nthe first emergence of the good, revealing the heart of Heaven and Earth.\nIn *Dazhuang*, the four yang, with *Zhen* atop *Qian*—\nmanifesting in countenance, revealing the emotions of Heaven and Earth.\nIn *Kun*, the six yin govern stillness—\nprofoundly unmoving, revealing the nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIt is also said: \"Stillness can save movement—\nthis takes stillness as primary.\"\nStillness resides here, empty and luminous, thoroughly penetrating.\nFrom here, the response naturally flows with clarity.\nIf the heart harbors selfishness, all is amiss.\nWhen the heart is serene and purely present here,\nwithout a trace of selfish intent,\nthen things come and are named,\nand movement and stillness are both in accord with principle.\n\nI once heard that Master Li of Yanping taught others\nto generally engage in recognition within stillness.\nWhen the great root has not yet arisen,\nthe qi’s appearance distinguishes stillness from movement.\nIn handling affairs and responding to things,\none naturally accords with the mean.\nThis is the transmitted oral instruction of the Guishan lineage.\n\nThe human heart should be like a bright mirror or still water,\nnot like withered wood or dead ashes.\nThough the mirror is bright and the water still, their essence is stillness,\nyet they can reflect things.\nWithin stillness lies movement; within essence lies function—\nsuch is the wonder of the human heart.\nIf it were withered wood, it could not grow;\nif dead ashes, it could not ignite—\nthese are things without use.\n\nThe heart possesses all principles and responds to all affairs.\nIf abandoned, can it be without use?\n\nIt is also said: Stillness does not mean shutting the door and sitting alone,\nrigidly guarding oneself,\nresponding to nothing, like *Gen*’s cessation.\nCessation is stillness;\nthat by which it ceases is movement.\nHere again, stillness contains movement,\navoiding the bias of one-sided speech.\n\nThe learning of Laozi lies in movement within stillness.\nThe learning of Su and Zhang flows into movement without stillness.\nThus, there are those who focus solely on comprehending the principle of profound stillness.\nYet when it comes to handling affairs, they are utterly confused,\neven disturbing their own profound stillness.\nThere are others who focus solely on comprehending affairs,\nyet neglect the root entirely.\nOne must penetrate above and below, inner and outer as one,\nlike dwelling in *ren* and thus being able to act through *yi*,\nacting through *yi* and thus being able to dwell in *ren*,\nbeing upright within and thus able to square without,\nsquaring without and thus able to be upright within—\nonly then is it achieved.\n\nIt is also said: Reverence pervades movement and stillness,\nso seeking, releasing, grasping, and preserving are all within—\nthis is not what is meant by rigidly maintaining silence.\nThe learning of the noble person unifies inner and outer—\nit cannot be divided in two.\nIf one speaks only of nurturing the unarisen,\nyet cannot control the errors of the arisen,\nthis is having gained in stillness but not in movement.\nIf one only knows how to control the arisen,\nyet does not nurture the unarisen,\nthis is having gained in movement but not in stillness.\n\nPreservation is the work of stillness—\nstillness is the mean, without bias.\nIntrospection is the work of movement—\nmovement is harmony, without discord.\nIn stillness, awareness is not obscured—\n*Fu* reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth, movement within stillness.\nIn movement, all issuances accord with the norm—\n*Gen*’s \"not obtaining its body, not seeing its person,\"\nstillness within movement.\n\nThe previous chapter used the terms \"movement and stillness\"\nto show that *Taiji* moves and generates yang—\nthis is the arising of function before Heaven and Earth.\nThis chapter uses the terms \"stillness and movement\"\nto show that stillness contracts and movement expands—\nthe essence precedes the precelestial, and the function follows the postcelestial.\n\nThus it is said: If the dragon and snake do not coil,\nthey have nothing with which to soar to the heavens;\nif the hawk does not bend,\nit has nothing with which to extend.\nThis, too, is the natural principle of Heaven.\n\nThe noble person stores their instrument within,\nwaiting for the right time to act—\nthis, too, must be carefully considered.\n\nDiscerning directions:\nThe north—*ren*, *gui*, *hai*, *zi*—\nis the land where water flourishes,\nand its hexagram is *Kan*.\n\nOne yang lies trapped within two yins—\nthis is peril, toil, concealment, and latency.\nIts direction is called the Dark Capital,\nalso named the Northern Beginning.\n\"Beginning\" (*shuo*) means \"revival\" (*su*):\nall things come here to die and revive,\nas the moon wanes into darkness and then returns with the new moon.\nWhen the sun reaches this point, it sinks beneath the earth,\nand all phenomena fall into obscurity.\n\nIn the *Precelestial Diagram*, *Qian* lies to the south and *Kun* to the north.\n*Qian* descends to join *Kun*, forming *Kan*;\n*Kun* ascends to join *Qian*, forming *Li*.\nYang is born within *zi*; yin is born within *wu*.\n*Kan* and *Li* unite in embrace,\nwith *zi* and *wu* facing one another.\nYang serves as sovereign; yin, as minister.\nHeaven and humankind alike turn their backs to the north and face the south—\nthus the south is manifest, while the north lies hidden.\nThe Celestial Pole resides in the north,\nand the surrounding stars, numbering the four directions,\nall regard the north as supreme, the south as its counterpart,\nthen east and west in proper sequence.\nThus *Tai Xuan* takes \"boundless darkness\" as the north,\nwhile Shao Kangjie places the *Taiji* between *Kun* and *Fu*.\n\nMaster Cheng Shuzhi said:\n\"Beginning\" (*shuo*) means \"first\"—\nit refers to the direction where yang first stirs.\nLike the north, it marks the end of yin and the birth of yang.\nMaster Shao said:\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of yang *qi*\narising from the north and returning to the north—\nthis is the cyclical transformation of change.\n\nIn the *Canon of Yao*, the three directions—east, west, and south—\nare all described as \"properly ordered,\"\nwhile only the north is called \"properly positioned.\"\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* states:\n\"As the year scatters toward its end,\nthe new year is about to begin.\"\nMaster Yichuan further said:\nHaving completed the end of the present year,\none must also consider the beginning of the coming year.\n\"End\" and \"beginning,\" \"present year\" and \"coming year\"—\nall form the Two Modes.\nAgain, when *Kun* transforms into *Kan*,\none hexagram becomes two.\nLast year’s yang *qi* ends here,\nand this year’s yang *qi* arises from this same point.\n\nMaster Zhu said:\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there are fixed boundaries—\nsuch as the four directions—\nand there are cyclical movements—\nsuch as the four seasons.\nThe north holds two meanings:\nfor instance, the forty-five days before the Winter Solstice belong to the present year,\nwhile the forty-five days after belong to the coming year.\nSimilarly, the four *ke* before midnight belong to today,\nand the four *ke* after belong to tomorrow.\n*Gen* governs the beginning and end of all things.\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird are each a single entity,\nwhile the Black Tortoise and Serpent are two.\nHeaven has spring, summer, autumn, and winter—\nits climatic patterns are uneven.\nEarth has east, west, south, and north—\nits boundaries are fixed and unchanging.\nThus the northwest region is both the Northern Beginning\nand simply the North.\n\nIn Heaven’s southeast, there is both sovereign fire and ministerial fire.\nThe sun and moon are the true essences of yin and yang,\ngiving rise to water and fire.\nThus among the seven luminaries, there is the sun and also fire,\nthe moon and also water.\nIn the human body’s five viscera,\nthe heart has the pericardium,\nand the kidneys have the Gate of Life.\nWater and fire each have two aspects,\nwith sovereign fire and true essence truly interconnected.\nTrue fire has *qi* but no form—\nthis is what is meant by \"the heart being singular while the kidneys are paired.\"\nThe Vermilion Bird is one, while the Black Tortoise and Serpent are two.\nThus the heart is singular, while the kidneys are paired.\nIn the trigrams of *Qian* and *Kun*,\nthe north is represented by both tortoise and serpent.\n\nIn Kan’s *Book of Changes*, *Li* contains the image of the tortoise,\nas well as armor and helmets.\nThe tortoise has a shell—hence its martial aspect.\n*Sun*, *Yi*, and *Yi* all mention the tortoise,\nand their interlocking trigrams contain *Li*.\nDrawing *qi* inward resembles the image of yang lying hidden beneath the earth.\nOn its back, at the center, are five lines,\nwhich extend outward to form the Eight Trigrams,\nand further outward to form the twenty-four solar terms.\nThis imagery is apt,\nyet it remains unclear why it corresponds to the twelfth earthly branch,\nas *si* does not occupy the northern position.\n\nKan’s *Records* and *Book of Documents Commentary*\nmake no mention of this—why?\nPerhaps the character *xuan* (玄) curves and winds like a serpent,\nand when transformed, becomes a dragon.\n*Zhen* represents the dragon lying beneath *Kun*—\nthis may relate to the meaning of *Fu*, but requires separate investigation.\n\nSome say:\nYang *xuan* belongs to the serpent,\nwhile martial yin belongs to the tortoise.\nMaster Wang stated:\nThe kidneys are two, and so are the tortoise and serpent—\nthus the Northern Beginning pertains to *zhen* (貞),\nwhich has two meanings: uprightness and constancy.\nThe character *zhi* (智) also has two meanings:\nits first half, representing gathering and storage, belongs to yin;\nits latter half, representing opening and release, belongs to yang.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* states:\nThe tortoise and serpent roam in four directions,\nsymbolizing the celestial lodges.\nThe tortoise has a shell, enabling defense—hence its martial aspect.\nIts color is black—hence *xuan* (玄).\nMaster Wei said:\nThe male does not dwell alone,\nnor does the female live in solitude.\nThe Black Warrior—tortoise and serpent—\ncoil and intertwine in mutual support.\nIf a hen crows at dawn,\nher chicks will not thrive.\nObserve the moment of mating between male and female:\nhard and soft intertwine, inseparable.\nThey follow their natural rhythms,\nwithout need for artifice or control.\nWhen a boy is born, he lies prone;\nwhen a girl is born, she lies supine—\nthis is how they received *qi* in the womb,\nand in death, they return to this state.\nThis is not taught by parents—\nit is the marvel of creation’s spontaneity.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan said:\nOne singular, one paired—\nthese are the complementary forms of yin and yang.\nThree yangs and one yin—\none abundant, one deficient—\nthese are the functions of yin and yang.\nThus in the four seasons, spring, summer, and autumn generate life,\nwhile winter does not.\nHeaven and Earth’s east, west, and south are visible,\nwhile the north is not.\nIn human vision, what lies ahead and to the sides is visible,\nwhile the back is not—\nall these are the marvels of creation’s spontaneity.\n\nYang Xiong took the north as *xuan*,\nencompassing the three directions.\n\"Boundless\" and \"dark\"—\nhis intent lies precisely here.\nNow, examining the *Tai Xuan*,\nits text reads: \"Boundless, straight, obscure, chief, dark.\"\n\"Boundless\" is the north—\nwhere the ten thousand things lie hidden in the Yellow Springs, beyond naming.\nThus the ten thousand things are \"boundless\" in the north,\n\"straight\" in the east,\n\"obscure\" in the south,\nand \"chief\" in the north.\n\"Boundless\" is where being emerges from non-being.\n\"Dark\" is where brightness conceals itself in obscurity.\n\"Boundless\" releases its *qi*—\nyang *qi* is contained within.\n\"Dark\" returns to its depths—\nthings lie in the Yellow Springs.\n\nFrom obscurity they emerge, into obscurity they return—\nthe new and the old alternate, replacing one another in the depths of darkness.\nWhat is to come advances; what has fulfilled its purpose retreats.\nIn this moment of *wang*, how profound is the Mystery!\n\nThe formed enters the formless; the formless issues forth as form—\nthus is the Mystery.\nThe moment of *wang* can be regulated:\nthe eighty-one houses all derive from *wang*,\nfor the formless can be governed.\n\nIt is further said:\nHeaven’s Mystery lies in its invisibility,\nEarth’s Mystery in its formlessness,\nMan’s Mystery in the heart and belly.\nHeaven’s depths lie in the northwest, where essence transforms in seclusion.\nIn the tenth month, pure *kun* governs,\nand yang *qi* accumulates beneath the earth.\nEarth’s depths lie in the Yellow Springs, where souls and spirits flourish.\nMan’s depths lie in thought and contemplation, containing the purest essence.\n\nPondering this passage,\nthe meaning of the north’s *wang* and *ming* becomes unmistakably clear.\nFor when the ten thousand things enter the north,\nbeing transforms into non-being—thus it is called *ming*.\nWhen the ten thousand things emerge from the north,\nnon-being transforms into being—thus it is called *wang*.\n\nMaster Zhang states:\n*Ming* corresponds to the unused One,\nthe place where the Three rest, hidden in secrecy.\nI say:\nThis is the first half before the winter solstice, belonging to the present year’s affairs.\nIt is further said:\n*Wang* corresponds to the formless One,\nthe source from which the Four arise, issuing from the void.\nThis is the latter half after the winter solstice, belonging to the coming year’s affairs.\nFirst, one enters *ming*; afterward, one emerges into *wang*.\n*Ming* should be the north; *wang* should be the center.\nThus the center of Heaven lies in the north—this is the celestial pole.\n*Ming* and *wang* first rest, then generate—\nsuch is the way of those with a root.\n\nTherefore it is said:\nHeaven has four seasons, yet winter is unused;\nEarth has four directions, yet the north is unused;\nMan has four limbs, yet the back is unused.\nOne is fixed and unmoving; the Three are endlessly employed.\nHeaven and Earth’s Mystery lies in the north—\nhow deep it is!\n\nSome say:\n*Ming* is the profound virtue, abiding at the center, unmoving.\n*Wang*, *zhi*, *meng*, and *qiu* correspond to Qian’s *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, and *zhen*.\nThis interpretation is most fitting.\n\nZhu Hanshang states:\nKan is originally Kun’s body, residing in the north,\npresiding over the affairs of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits.\nThe north’s entry into *ming* is Heaven’s form.\nKan is the abode of ghosts and spirits;\nDou is Heaven’s temple, also governing ancestral sacrifices.\nThis is one explanation.\n\nMoreover, in the primordial arrangement, Kun is placed in the north,\nopposite Qian in the south—encompassing both celestial and terrestrial affairs.\nKing Wen later transformed it into Kan,\nfor no other reason than that Qian’s single yang comes to interact with Kun’s body,\nthus forming Kan.\nKan opposes Li, creating the Water-Fire *jiji* hexagram,\nextending to the daily needs of the people.\nWithin it lies the mutual body of Gen,\nwhere the northwest’s yin beauty finds its limit.\nThe southeast’s yang harmony is complete,\nyet hidden within is Zhen.\nFrom this, generation begins.\nKun contains hidden Kan.\n\nKun’s *sixth line* in the *Wenyan* states:\n\"Heaven is dark; Earth is yellow.\"\n\"Heaven’s darkness\" refers to the color of Kan’s single yang;\n\"Earth’s yellow\" refers to its outer four yin lines.\n\nThus at the winter solstice,\nthe sun, moon, and five planets all rise at the first degree of Qianniu.\nQianniu is the stellar chronicle, the Water position, the Kan hexagram.\nTherefore the *gua qi* begins with Zhongfu,\nand the *Tai Xuan* commences with *Zhongshou*—all for this reason.\n\nThe *Xuanhun* (Mystery-Encompassing)\n\nZhu Xi’s *Original Meaning* states: The yang qi is vigorous, and its greatest formed manifestation is Heaven. The nature of Kun is compliant, and its most expansive formed manifestation is Earth. Inspired by poetry, he further says:\n*\"Gazing upward at the encompassing Mystery, in a single breath it races ten thousand miles.\nLooking downward at the square norm’s stillness, it abides in collapse through a thousand ages.\"*\nThus its vigor and compliance are evident.\n\nMoreover, within the cosmos, all things undergo decline and rest. Only Heaven moves without ceasing—each day passing one degree, never pausing. Heaven is not like Earth, which possesses form; above Earth, there is nothing that is not Heaven. For every foot of Earth, there is a foot of Heaven—it is merely that people do not perceive it. That which is light and pure, ascending and floating, is Heaven. Heaven is round and in motion, enveloping Earth within its midst. Earth is square and still, and thus heavy and turbid, sinking downward—all being the dregs and congealed sediment of Heaven’s qi settling below. In its origin, it was but a single qi. Divided into two, yang encompasses yin, while yin does not encompass yang. Thus Qian Heaven’s One embraces Kun Earth’s Two to become Three.\n\nEarth resides within Heaven, and Earth’s qi is entirely Heaven’s qi. Master Zhang [Zai] says: *\"The Void is the ancestor of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth emerge from the Void. Its Dao takes utmost emptiness as true reality. Gold and iron may corrode, mountains and peaks may crumble. All things possessing form are easily destroyed, yet the Great Void knows no disturbance—thus it is the most real. ‘What Heaven above bears has neither sound nor scent’—this is perfection.\"*\n\nHe further states: *\"The empty and void, containing nothing, is that from which the myriad things arise.\"*\n\nMaster Shao [Yong] says: *\"Heaven faces one center to divide creation.\"* Heaven is originally One; with Earth, it divides into Two. Yang is originally one line; with yin, it divides into two lines. Thus, in every affair and thing, all are pressing toward Earth. Where there is growth, there is decline; where there is a front, there is a back—all is natural, not something human effort can contrive. The so-called *\"prior to Heaven, one thing is absent\"* requires no arrangement to be so.\n\nHe further says: *\"If we speak of the prior-Heaven single line, as soon as there is One, there is Two, Four, Eight, and Three Hundred Eighty-Four—though from this point onward it unfolds, how could it require arrangement?\"*\n\nYaofu asked Master Cheng: *\"Do you know how thunder arises?\"*\nYichuan replied: *\"I know it.\"*\nYaofu said: *\"I do not.\"*\n\nHaving known it, why resort to tedious calculation?\n\nYaofu asked: *\"From where does it arise?\"*\nYichuan replied: *\"It arises from where it arises.\"*\nYaofu, struck with sudden insight, praised this answer.\n\nI say: Thunder arises from the One at Heaven’s root—this is the division of creation from within the One.\n\nHe further says: *\"Heaven relies on form; Earth clings to qi.\"*\nSomeone asked Yaofu: *\"To what does Heaven cling?\"*\nHe replied: *\"Heaven clings to Earth through qi.\"*\n*\"To what does Earth attach?\"*\n*\"Earth attaches to Heaven through form.\"*\nHeaven and Earth naturally depend on each other.\n\nSpeaking of their essence: Heaven divides to become Earth, and Earth divides to become the myriad things. Yet the Dao cannot be divided. In the end, the myriad things return to Earth, Earth returns to Heaven, and Heaven returns to the Dao. Heaven’s ceaseless motion alone holds Earth suspended at its center—were Heaven’s singular movement ever to pause, Earth would plunge downward, and all people would perish.\n\nMaster Cheng Bozi said: *\"Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and all living things within Earth are Heaven’s qi.\"*\nMaster Cheng Shuzi said: *\"Wherever there is qi, it is Heaven; wherever there is form, it is Earth.\"*\nMaster Zhang said: *\"The void is qi. Wherever there is a heaven and earth, there is a span of qi.\"*\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Heaven’s form is round like a pellet, revolving day and night. Its north and south poles, higher behind and lower in front, are the unmoving pivot. What revolves has no fixed substance—it is but a fierce wind spiraling upward and downward without cease, the body of Heaven though not truly a body. Earth, however, is the dregs of qi condensed into form and substance. Yet bound within the fierce wind’s rotation, it remains steadfastly afloat in space, never falling.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked Qibo: *\"Does Earth have support?\"*\nQibo replied: *\"The great qi lifts it.\"* This is what he meant.\n\nUpon careful reflection: Qian is originally a single line, its substance entirely solid, like a single thing. From within, it expands to fill all of Heaven. The qi of Heaven’s inner covering all penetrates Earth’s center. Kun, however, divides into two lines—its capacity is thus hollow, allowing for opening and closing. Earth’s form is like the lungs: though its substance is solid, its center is empty. When Qian’s qi rises, Kun opens to either side, admitting Heaven’s qi to surge upward. Even metal and stone are permeated.\n\nHeaven’s form is like a drum’s skin, its outer layer enclosing abundant qi. As the *Monthly Ordinances* states in *First Month of Spring*: *\"Heaven’s qi descends; Earth’s qi ascends.\"* From the eleventh month, it accumulates until the fourth month, forming Qian. Qian’s qi lies beneath Kun, steaming upward like rice in a steamer. Yet in the fifth month, a single yin arises; by the seventh month, three yins below form Kun, and three yangs above form Qian. Heaven’s qi ascends, Earth’s qi descends—Heaven and Earth are cut off, sealed to become winter.\n\nIn the beginning, there were only the two qi of yin and yang. As they ground against each other, dregs rapidly accumulated within, with no exit. The sediment of water congealed into Earth, fixed at the center. Today, climbing high to view the mountains is like watching waves—akin to tide-borne sand rising. The extreme heat of fire’s qi generates wind, thunder, lightning, the sun, stars, and the like.\n\nHeaven has nine layers, each ascending purer than the last. The clear and firm qi becomes Heaven; without firmness, it could not envelop and nurture. Heaven is merely a whirlwind, spinning outward and inward, spinning out dregs to form Earth at its center. Thus Master Shao said: *\"Its form has limits; its qi is boundless.\"* And again: *\"The Dao is the root of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the root of the myriad things. Viewing the myriad things through Heaven and Earth, they are indeed myriad things. Viewing Heaven and Earth through the Dao, they too are but things.\"*\n\n*\"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\"* The Dao belongs to what is above form; yin and yang belong to what is below form. The great yin and yang of Heaven and Earth disperse into the myriad things, which are born bearing Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang qi. All confined within form and vessels are called things. Each thing possesses a single Supreme Polarity—this is called the Dao.\n\nThus, observing Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things by form, Heaven is great and the myriad things small. Observing them by the Dao, Heaven and Earth are but one thing within the Supreme Polarity.\n\nDong Guangwei said: *\"Gazing at the moon through drifting clouds, the moon moves while the clouds do not. Boarding a boat to cross water, the water flows while the boat does not.\"* These words carry meaning.\n\nMaster Zhou said: *\"Observe the vital force of Heaven and Earth in generating things. Within each thing lies the heart of Heaven and Earth, naturally reaching everywhere.\"* This is the transformation of Qian’s Dao, each fulfilling its nature and destiny.\n\nIf one reflects inwardly at the arising of good impulses, one will see it clearly. Animals possess blood and qi, thus they know. Though plants cannot know, their vital force is equally visible. If one harms them, they wither and droop, as if aware. Grass and fish are seen by all, yet only Mingdao and Lianxi saw them alike. When grass thrives in the courtyard, they said: *\"We wish to always witness the creative vitality of things.\"* When fish are kept in a basin, they said: *\"We wish to observe the self-contentment of the myriad things.\"* Such is the bearing of those who embody the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: *\"In tranquil observation, all things attain their nature.\"*\nMaster Cheng said: *\"Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their heart.\"*\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Heaven and Earth have no other task but to take generating things as their heart.\"*\n\nBeneath the pure Kun of the tenth month, a single yang revives. The heart of Heaven and Earth nearly extinguished, only then can it be seen again. Yichuan regarded the inception of movement as the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIt is said: *\"Movement is not the heart of Heaven and Earth, but only reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nRegarding the *Fu* hexagram, if viewed from the *xiantian* (pre-celestial) perspective, the single yang line emerges only after the *Bo* hexagram’s top yang (ninth line) transforms into the *Kun* hexagram’s top yin (sixth line), with thirty parts already accumulated by the tenth month. Like a child within the mother, the heart of Heaven and Earth in generating things remains concealed. Yet if viewed from the *houtian* (post-celestial) perspective, the single line beneath *Kun* suddenly transforms into *Zhen*, originally a *Gen* hexagram. When *Gen* is inverted, within the stillness of yin’s cessation, the mechanism of yang’s revival and flow becomes manifest. Like a child outside the mother, the heart of Heaven and Earth in generating things is then clearly visible.\n\nThe qi of the primordial unity never pauses for even a moment, ceaselessly giving rise to the myriad things. Heaven and Earth merely contain this vast qi within, with no outlet. Each time it gathers, it generates another round of beings. The workings of creation resemble a mill grinding out life—what emerges is both refined and coarse, never uniform.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born.\"* This is grand and evident, revealing the disposition of Heaven and Earth, yet it describes their effortless aspect. If they were truly without heart, then cows would give birth to horses, and peach trees would bear plums, for their heart would have no constancy.\n\nMaster Cheng said: *\"To call it ‘Emperor’ is to speak of its governance; the heart is precisely where it governs.\"* In the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, wherever the idea of governance appears, it is called *Di* (Emperor). Wherever the idea of encompassing and universal coverage appears, it is called *Tian* (Heaven).\n\nNanxuan remarked: *\"One cannot take the azure vault alone as Heaven. One must seek it in the realm of seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—wherever a single thought arises, there is the presence of the Supreme Emperor.\"* *\"The Lord on high watches over you; His scrutiny is ever in His heart.\"* The moment a thought strays, it is as if divine wrath descends.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"One must understand that it is without heart, yet also recognize that it has a heart.\"* Heaven envelops Earth, and what Heaven enacts is merely the knowing of generating things—this is a heart without intention. Yet when it rewards good and punishes evil, it seems as though there is a governor within. Similarly, the rising of winds and falling of rains, the crashing of thunder and flashing of lightning, the blooming and fruiting of flowers—how could these occur without a spirit?\n\nIt is further said: *\"All men under Heaven are the qi of Qian; all women under Heaven are the qi of Kun.\"* From this, extending upward and downward, all is one qi. Though it permeates all, even the most minute and hidden things, down to the finest hair, none lack the image of Qian and Kun.\n\nAll the myriad sounds under Heaven arise from opening and closing; all the myriad principles arise from movement and stillness; all the myriad numbers arise from odd and even; all the myriad forms arise from square and circle—all originate from the two lines of Qian and Kun.\n\nIn terms of physical form, it is called Heaven; in terms of governance, it is called Emperor; in terms of function, it is called ghosts and spirits; in terms of its wondrous workings, it is called spirit.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the outer shell of Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are the nature and disposition of Heaven and Earth. It is simply that this qi, when it wills to generate, generates—nothing less than utmost vigor can achieve this.\n\nThat which is rooted in Heaven turns upward: the heads of all moving creatures face the same direction, as do humans. That which is rooted in Earth turns downward: the heads of all plants point downward, as do grasses and trees. The heads of birds and beasts are often horizontal, which is why they lack intelligence.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is above; thus, the brain below gives rise to many things. Regarding the single origin of the myriad things, principle is the same while qi differs. Observing the distinct forms of the myriad things, qi remains somewhat similar, yet principle diverges entirely.\n\nQi is similar in that all beings know cold and warmth, recognize hunger and satiety, love life and hate death, pursue benefit and avoid harm—humans and creatures are alike in this. Principle differs in that, for instance, ants have a semblance of ruler and subject, revealing a trace of righteousness; tigers and wolves have a semblance of parent and child, revealing a trace of benevolence. Beyond this, further distinctions cannot be drawn.\n\nThis is why Heaven and Earth serve as the outer shell, encompassing all things within. Qian and Kun are their nature and disposition, which, as bestowed, vary in each being.\n\n*The Western Inscription* states: *\"Qian is called Father, Kun is called Mother; humans dwell within, embodying the way of the child.\"* Thus, the yang of Qian and the yin of Kun fill the space between Heaven and Earth, and all beings rely on them for their bodies. The vigor of Qian and the compliance of Kun are the aspirations of Heaven and Earth, leading the qi, and all beings derive their nature from them. This is why humans receive the uprightness of nature and destiny, becoming the most spiritually endowed of all beings, while other creatures receive only a partial endowment, sufficing for their kind alone.\n\nMaster Zhang said: *\"From the Great Void comes the name of Heaven; from the transformations of qi comes the name of the Dao. The union of void and qi gives the name of nature; the union of nature and consciousness gives the name of heart.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Originally, it was one Great Void, gradually refined into greater density.\"* The Great Void is the totality; speaking of the transformations of qi—those of yin and yang, the workings of creation, cold and heat, day and night, rain and dew, frost and snow, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, metal and water, fire and earth—does not depart from it. Though discussed in terms of the manifold transformations of qi, in truth, it does not leave the Great Void.\n\nThe Great Void is the circle above the Supreme Ultimate, within which yin is still and yang is dynamic. With this qi, principle resides within; without this qi, principle would have no place to abide.\n\nLike the moon reflected in water—only with this water can the moon above be mirrored. Qi has form, while the Great Void has no path. Through the forms of the tangible, the principle of the intangible is possessed, hence the consciousness of nature and heart. This is the luminous clarity of qi’s emptiness. Sight, hearing, action, and function—all depend on this consciousness to activate this principle.\n\nMaster Shao said: *\"Only with yin and yang can heaven be generated; only with hardness and softness can earth be generated.\"* The *Record of Rites* states: *\"Ritual fundamentally arises from the Supreme One, which divides to become heaven and earth.\"* The Supreme Ultimate is where qi has not yet appeared. The Great Beginning is the inception of qi. The Great Commencement is the inception of form. The Great Simplicity is the inception of substance. These four phrases together discuss the state before heaven and earth and the beginning of heaven and earth. Here, the origins of principle, qi, form, and substance are explained. Of all things, none are greater than heaven and earth.\n\nHeaven is born of movement. The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; yang, being light and pure, floats upward to become heaven. It is also said: *\"Yin and yang generate heaven, for yang is rooted in yin.\"* Thus, in heaven as yin and yang, there are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Earth is born of stillness. The Supreme Ultimate is still and generates yin; yin, being heavy and turbid, sinks downward to become earth. And it is said: *\"Hardness and softness generate earth, for yin is rooted in yang.\"* Thus, on earth as hardness and softness, there are water, fire, soil, and stone.\n\nSpeaking from their root, the Supreme Ultimate moves to generate yin and yang, thereby generating heaven and earth. Speaking separately: at the beginning of movement, yang is born; at the extreme of movement, yin is born. The alternation of one yin and one yang exhausts heaven’s function, hence it is said that yin and yang can generate heaven. At the beginning of stillness, softness is born; at the extreme of stillness, hardness is born. The alternation of one hardness and one softness exhausts earth’s function, hence it is said that hardness and softness can generate earth.\n\nRegarding heaven and earth as one qi: yang ascends from below. Ascension is generation, generating yang to dissolve yin. Yin descends from above. Descent is dissolution, generating yin to dissolve yang. Speaking of the two qi separately: that which ascends from below is yang born within earth. From *zi* to *si*, it completes *qian*, generating heaven. At *wu*, heaven reaches its center, then generates yin to establish yang. Once established, yang proceeds again, rotating left as the Way of Heaven. That which descends from above is yin born within heaven. From *wu* to *hai*, *kun* is fully generated as earth. At *zi*, earth reaches its center, then generates yang to establish yin. Once established, yin proceeds again, rotating right as the Way of Earth.\n\nGenerating heaven gives birth to the myriad things; generating earth brings them to completion. *Qian* and *kun* use only six lines, with six as the central number. Advancing six is an end; retreating six is a beginning. The end of day is the beginning of night; the end of night is the beginning of day. Comprehending day and night, one knows that the numbers of the *Yi* can exhaust the beginnings and ends of heaven and earth, clarifying the principle of waxing and waning.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Qian and kun determine the positions of above and below; kan and li arrange the gates of left and right.\"* Heaven has four images, earth has four images. Heaven has eight images, earth has eight images. Heaven and earth interlock, yin and yang intersect. Heaven governs the operation of the four seasons; earth governs the embodiment of the hundred things.\n\nIn the *Xiantian* arrangement, *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li* correspond to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—the four cardinal directions, encompassing both above and below. Thus, the opening and closing of heaven and earth, the rising and setting of the sun and moon, the four seasons, the dark and new moons, the crescents and full moons, the lengthening and shortening of days and nights, the degrees of celestial motion, and the waxing and waning of all things arise from these four images.\n\nIn heaven, yin and yang are old and young; including the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, they become eight. On earth, hardness and softness are old and young; including water, fire, soil, and stone, they also become eight. As for their interlocking: in the *Xiantian* diagram, the left side has one hundred twelve yang and eighty yin, and the top is the same; the right side has one hundred twelve yin and eighty yang, and the bottom is the same. As for their intersection: like male and female, husband and wife, yin and yang, *qian* going to intersect *kun* forms *fu*, and *kun* coming to intersect *qian* forms *gou*.\n\n*Qian* and *kun* stand divided in the center of yin and yang, establishing the bodies of heaven and earth. *Kan* and *li* intersect in the center of yin and yang, bringing forth the functions of heaven and earth. Yin and yang originally use *kan* and *li* to transform heaven and earth; heaven and earth in turn use *kan* and *li* to generate the myriad things.\n\nIn the *Houtian* arrangement of King Wen’s eight trigrams, the positions differ, with *kan*, *li*, *zhen*, and *dui* occupying the four cardinal directions, while the remaining four trigrams occupy the four corners. Why is this? The North Star resides in the north, slightly to the west, where the celestial spirits dwell, hence the northwest is *qian*. Kunlun resides in the west, slightly to the south, where the earthly spirits abide, hence the southwest is *kun*. Nothing stirs the myriad things like wind; as qi moves from east to south, the southeast is *xun*. Of the Five Peaks, none is more revered than the Eastern Peak; as earth’s form extends from north to east, the northeast is *gen*.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Heaven is round and earth is square.\"* Heaven is high in the south and low in the north, so when observed, it appears like an overturned bowl. Tang monk Yixing said: *\"The *gaitian* model is like a painted sphere, showing only half. The *huntian* model is like a viewed sphere, showing its entirety.\"* Shun’s *jixuan* follows the *huntian* method.\n\nCai Yong’s *Treatise on Astronomy* states: *\"There are three schools of celestial bodies. The first is the *Zhoubi*. It describes heaven as an overturned basin, with the Dipper’s handle at the center, high in the middle and low at the edges, while the sun and moon move around it. When they are near, they are seen as day; when far, they are unseen as night. Though its calculations are detailed, they contain many errors, so the Bureau of Astronomy does not use it.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"Heaven is round like an open umbrella; earth is square like a chessboard. Heaven moves like a turning millstone to the left; the sun and moon move to the right, following heaven’s leftward rotation.\"*\n\nThus, the sun and moon truly move eastward, yet are pulled to set in the west. When the sun rises high, it is seen; when it sets, it is unseen. At dawn, it emerges into the yang realm; at dusk, it enters the yin realm—yin qi is dark, hence it is unseen.\n\nThe second school is *Xuanye*. Yu Xi said: *\"Xuan* means brightness; *ye*, darkness. Its calculations encompass both the bright and the dark.\"* You Meng’s *Records* state: \"The sun, moon, and stars float in the void of empty space. Their movement and stillness all depend on qi.\" It is also said: \"Heaven stands firm above, possessing a constant and stable form.\" This incorporates elements of the *Gaitian* theory.\n\nLi Chunfeng’s *Gaitian* theory states: \"Heaven and earth are high at the center and low at the four edges. The sun and moon conceal one another, creating day and night as they revolve. The North Pole is always visible as the *upper circle*; the South Pole is always hidden as the *middle circle*; the celestial equator stretches horizontally as the *lower circle*.\"\n\nThe third school is *Huntian*. Ge Hong said: \"Heaven’s shape is like an egg; earth is like its yolk. Earth resides within heaven, heaven large and earth small. Beyond heaven’s surface lies water; heaven and earth each ride upon qi and float, carried by water as they move. Dividing the celestial sphere in half, the lower half covers the earth, while the upper half circles beneath it.\" Song scholar He Chengtian said: \"Heaven’s form is perfectly round, with water occupying half. The east is where the sun rises, called *Yanggu*; the west is where it sets, called *Chengchi*. Zhuangzi spoke of the *Northern and Southern Limits*—this is evidence that water surrounds all four directions, hence the term *Four Seas*. Within the Five Phases, water is born of metal, and all rivers originate from mountains before flowing downward into the sea. The sun is the essence of yang; when it enters water at night, it would scorch and dry up, but the rivers’ return replenishes it. Thus, drought does not cause desiccation, nor does flooding cause overflow.\"\n\nWang Fan also said: \"The sun and moon first ascend into heaven, then descend into earth. The sun is above the earth by day and below it by night.\" Today’s astronomical observatories largely follow this method. Yang Xiong said: \"Luo Xiaheng designed it, Xianyu Wangren measured it, and Geng Zhongcheng modeled it.\" Later Han scholars Cai Yong, Zhang Heng, and Zheng Xuan all regarded *Huntian* as superior.\n\nIn my humble opinion, beyond these there are also the *Xuantian* and *Xintian* theories, but none are worth adopting. Wu scholar Yao Xin said: \"Humans are like spiritual creatures, their forms most resembling heaven. The face tilts forward toward the chest, while the crown does not cover the back. Thus, heaven’s body slopes downward in the south, entering the earth, while the north is higher—this also reveals why humans are noble.\" Ouyang Xiu said: \"The ancients measured the gnomon’s shadow, intending to regulate and harmonize qi to assist the proper timing of things, not to debate the merits of *Huntian* or *Gaitian* models. Whether one holds *Gaitian* or *Huntian*, the south’s degrees gradually narrow, while the north’s pole rises higher. Endless disputes over differences—what benefit do they bring to human ethics and transformation?\"\n\nYet in investigating things, the noble person prioritizes exhausting principles and extending knowledge. It is also said: \"The northwest is high, supporting the heavens’ summit.\" Master Zhang said: \"Yu Xi’s words—'Heaven stands firm above, possessing a constant and stable form'—are all profoundly meaningful. It is only regrettable that he did not explore their beginning and end.\"\n\nThe *Luoshu*’s numbers begin with nine atop and one below. One arises from below, forming *Kan* Water—the inception of heaven’s image. Nine culminates above, forming *Qian* Metal—the completion of heaven’s image. Thus, *Kan* Water is yielding and moves, while *Qian* Metal is firm and congeals. Movement generates pulse and life, while the brain’s essence remains tranquil—this is the North Pole as heaven’s summit, steadfast and unmoving, possessing a constant and stable form, which is also the image of *Gaitian*.\n\nIt is also said: \"Heaven’s yang lies in the south, its yin in the north. Earth’s yin lies in the south, its yang in the north. Heaven’s yang is in the south, hence the sun resides there. Earth’s firmness is in the north, hence mountains reside there. Thus, earth is high in the northwest, heaven high in the southeast. The far south is intensely hot; the far north, intensely cold. Therefore, the south melts while the north congeals—these are the deathly realms of the myriad things. Heaven slopes downward from south to north, yang in the south, yin in the north. Thus, in the *Xiantian* circular diagram, *Qian*’s position is south, *Kun*’s north. Earth slopes downward from north to south, yang in the north, yin in the south. Thus, in the *Xiantian* square diagram, *Qian* is positioned in the northwest, *Kun* in the southeast. When the sun is in the south, it is at meridian; when in the north, it is hidden. Heaven’s south is yang above, hence the far south is intensely hot. What appears on earth melts into water. Though earth has yin, it cannot suppress yang. Heaven’s north is yin above, hence the far north is intensely cold. What appears on earth congeals into mountains. Though earth has yang, it is suppressed by yin. Yang’s nature, when extreme, melts; yin’s nature, when extreme, congeals. Earth’s south should be cold but is low and hot; its north should be hot but is high and cold—this follows heaven. Water is yielding and belongs to yin. As yin cannot overcome yang, it serves yang’s purpose. Mountains are firm and belong to yang. As yang cannot overcome yin, they serve yin’s purpose. Thus, in form, they follow earth’s yielding and firmness; in qi, they follow heaven’s cold and heat. At the extremes of yang and yin, qi is not harmonious. The myriad things do not grow—hence, these are deathly realms. Only where heaven and earth’s cold and heat intermingle and harmonize do the myriad things flourish.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Scholar Hu of Anding said: 'Heaven is the form of *Qian*; *Qian* is heaven’s function. Heaven’s form is azure, with the southern pivot sinking thirty-six degrees below earth and the northern pivot rising thirty-six degrees above it, resembling a leaning pestle. Its function is such that in one day and night, it travels over nine hundred thousand *li*. With each human breath, heaven moves eighty *li*. In one day and night, a person takes over thirteen thousand six hundred breaths.'\"\n\nThus, heaven travels over nine hundred thousand *li* in a day and night. I humbly note: The *Book of Elixirs* states that in one day and night, a person takes thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. One thousand one hundred twenty-five breaths correspond to one *shi* (two-hour period), which would total thirteen thousand five hundred sixty breaths. Master Wending [Hu Hong] cited a round number.\n\nZheng’s commentary on the *Kao Ling Yao* says: The Great Void originally has no form or body; it is only by observing the movement of the stars that we conceive of heaven’s body. Yet the stars’ revolution is from east to west, and after three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days, they return to their original positions. While the stars revolve leftward, the sun moves rightward, also taking three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days to return to its original stellar position. Taking one day’s movement as one *du* (degree), and calculating across the twenty-eight lunar lodges, a full celestial circuit measures nearly three hundred sixty-five and a quarter *du*—this is the measure of heaven’s single revolution. Heaven is like a pellet from a sling, its circumference three hundred sixty-five and a quarter *du*. Each *du* spans two thousand nine hundred thirty-two *li* and three hundred forty-eight parts of one thousand four hundred sixty-one *li*, making the total circumference of heaven one million seventy-one thousand *li*. Speaking of circumference as three times the diameter, the straight diameter of the twenty-eight lodges’ circuit is three hundred fifty-seven thousand *li*. Beyond the twenty-eight lodges, above, below, east, and west each extend fifteen thousand *li*, forming the four extremes of celestial motion, called the Four Limits. Within the Four Limits and the lodges’ interior, the total distance is three hundred eighty-seven thousand *li*. At heaven’s central point, directly above and below, the distance is one hundred ninety-three thousand five hundred *li*. Earth lies at its center—this is the distance from earth to heaven.\n\nIt further states: Earth’s thickness increases by thirty thousand *li*. Wang Fan’s commentary on the *Shangshu* says: Heaven above earth spans one hundred eighty-two and a half *du* and more; the same is true below earth. The North Pole rises thirty-six *du* above earth, with Mount Song directly aligned with heaven’s center. Fifty-five *du* south of the pole lies the summit of Mount Song. Twelve *du* further south is the sun’s path at the Summer Solstice. Another twenty-four *du* south is the sun’s path at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes. Yet another twenty-four *du* south is the Winter Solstice path. Southward, the distance to earth is only thirty-one *du*. Thus, at the Summer Solstice, the sun is sixty-seven *du* from the North Pole; at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, ninety-one *du*; and at the Winter Solstice, one hundred fifteen *du*. The North and South Poles hold heaven’s two ends, while heaven, the sun, moon, and stars revolve obliquely—this is the general principle. Ancient methods once existed but were lost during the Qin.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Though the celestial sphere encircles earth, earth remains centrally level, while heaven slopes downward to the south. The celestial circuit is divided equally between north and south. The North Pole rises thirty-six *du* above earth, with the rest submerged; the South Pole sinks thirty-six *du* below earth, with the rest visible. Heaven and humanity both face south with their backs to the north, hence the southern sky is seen while the northern is hidden.\n\nHe further said: The celestial circuit encircling the North Pole spans seventy-two *du*, always visible and never concealed—this is called the Upper Rule. The circuit encircling the South Pole spans seventy-two *du*, always hidden and never seen—this is called the Lower Rule. Though the yin realm divides into yin and yang, the constant concealment and visibility belong to the static reckoning, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram’s one hundred forty-four counting rods. The east-west circuit in motion spans two hundred sixteen *du*. Though the yang realm divides into yin and yang, the alternating motion belongs to the dynamic reckoning, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods. The hexagram represents earth; the lines represent heaven. The *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods total two hundred sixty.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Earth rises and falls; the sun’s path lengthens and shortens. Though earth is a congealed, indissoluble substance, the two qi rise and descend, endlessly following one another. When yang ascends daily, earth descends daily, and what descends becomes empty. When yang descends daily, earth ascends daily, and what ascends becomes full—this is the pattern of the year’s cold and heat.\n\nThe *Kao Ling Yao* states: Earth’s thickness increases by thirty thousand *li*. At the Spring Equinox, earth lies at heaven’s center; from then on, it gradually descends. By the Summer Solstice, earth has sunk fifteen thousand *li*, its upper edge level with heaven’s center. After the Summer Solstice, earth gradually rises. By the Autumn Equinox, it returns to heaven’s center; from then on, it gradually ascends. By the Winter Solstice, it has risen fifteen thousand *li*, its lower edge level with heaven’s center. After the Winter Solstice, it gradually descends—this is earth’s rise and fall within thirty thousand *li*. Heaven moves laterally within the Four Limits: south in winter, north in summer, west in spring, and east in autumn, each time brushing the Four Limits before stopping. Earth likewise rises and falls within heaven: descending at the Winter Solstice and ascending at the Summer Solstice, with the two solstices marking the extremes of earth’s thickness.\n\nThe *Kao Ling Yao* further states: In the first month, the sun is eight thousand *li* above and one hundred four thousand *li* below—hence the terms \"above\" and \"below.\" Zheng’s commentary says: Heaven is one hundred ninety-three thousand five hundred *li* from earth. At the Rain Water solar term in the first month, the sun is above, eight thousand *li* from heaven, and one hundred thirteen thousand five hundred *li* from earth. At the Summer Solstice, the sun reaches its highest point, level with heaven’s edge, then gradually descends. By the Winter Solstice, the sun is eight thousand *li* from earth and one hundred thirteen thousand five hundred *li* from heaven.\n\nAs detailed in the *Kao Ling Yao* commentary: The twenty-eight lodges and all stars revolve leftward with heaven, completing one celestial circuit each day and night.\n\nBeyond one celestial circuit, the heavens advance by one degree, totaling three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter circuits in a year. The sun, moon, and five planets, however, move rightward. The sun travels one degree per day, while the moon advances thirteen and seven-nineteenths degrees daily. These are the harmonized reckonings.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Heaven and earth drift in four directions, ascending and descending no more than thirty thousand *li*. The *Rites of Zhou* states that a one-*cun* shadow on the earthen gnomon corresponds to one thousand *li*. A shadow of one *chi* and five *cun* thus corresponds to fifteen thousand *li*. Since this measurement is taken at the center of the earth, the distances from north to south and east to west are each thirty thousand *li*—not that the space between heaven and earth is limited to this span. In spring, the earth drifts three thousand *li* past the east; in summer, three thousand *li* past the south; and likewise in autumn to the west and in winter to the north. Imagine a great basin filled with water, with an empty vessel floating at its center, marking the four directions. If the vessel drifts three *cun* eastward—where one *cun* equals ten thousand *li*—then it recedes three *cun* from the west. Just as the earth is deeper than the water, when it tilts three thousand *li* past the east, it withdraws three thousand *li* from the west. The same applies to north and south. Thus, the varying lengths of day and night in winter and summer are not caused by the gnomon’s shadow or the sun’s rising and setting, but rather by the earth’s cyclical drift through the four directions.\n\nSomeone asks: There is no such principle. Though it cannot be known for certain, the calculations of astronomers all align with this reckoning. Perhaps such a principle exists. Both the earth and the stars undergo fourfold drifting and ascending-descending. The fourfold drift begins at the *Lichun* solar term, when the earth and stars drift westward. At the *Chunfen* solar term, the westward drift reaches its extreme, though the earth’s ascent and descent remain centered. From there, it gradually drifts eastward until the end of spring, when it returns to its original position. After *Lixia*, it drifts northward; at the *Xiazhi* solar term, the northward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent reach their lowest point. By the end of summer, it returns to center. After *Liqiu*, it drifts eastward; at the *Qiufen* solar term, the eastward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent return to center. By the end of autumn, it is restored. After *Lidong*, it drifts southward; at the *Dongzhi* solar term, the southward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent reach their highest point. By the end of winter, it returns to center. This is the meaning of the earth’s and stars’ fourfold drift. The stars also rise and fall with the earth, never exceeding the thirty thousand *li* range. Halving this gives fifteen thousand *li*, matching the one *chi* and five *cun* of the earthen gnomon. A one-*chi* discrepancy corresponds to ten thousand *li*, while five *cun* correspond to five thousand *li*. A one-*fen* difference equals one hundred *li*. Thus, the lengthening and shortening of shadows all differ by one *cun*. Therefore, the royal domain of a thousand *li* takes its model from the sun. One *cun* is set as the standard, and when the sun is observed at its fullest, its breadth of one *chi* corresponds to a thousand *li*.\n\nSomeone asks: The theory of fourfold drift is baseless and unorthodox. Thus, the *Erya* commentary does not follow Zheng’s annotation. I say: Amidst the confusion of many voices, one need only consult the sacred classics and worthy traditions to resolve it. Now, both Master Zhang and Master Zhu have affirmed this theory—there is no cause for doubt.\n\nSomeone asks: Master Zhu said: *The Rites of Zhou* employs the method of the earthen gnomon to measure the depth of the soil, align the sun’s shadow, and determine the center of the land. When the sun is in the south, shadows lengthen and cold increases; when in the east, evening shadows bring frequent winds; when in the west, morning shadows bring much overcast.\n\nAnother asks: Zheng’s commentary states: “Evening shadows” refer to the moment when the sun’s reflection aligns the shadow. The gnomon is placed too far east, near the sun. “Morning shadows” refer to the moment before noon when the shadow aligns. The gnomon is placed too far west, distant from the sun.\n\nMaster Zhu replied: “Evening shadows bring frequent winds; morning shadows bring much overcast.” These two lines in Zheng’s commentary cannot be dismissed, though his explanation is inverted. It appears that “evening shadows” occur when the shadow aligns late. Before noon, the shadow has already aligned. If the gnomon is placed too far south, the sun is nearer, making shadows shorter before noon and longer after. “Morning shadows” occur when the sun has already passed noon, yet the shadow has not yet aligned. If the gnomon is placed too far north, the sun is more distant, making shadows longer before noon and shorter after.\n\nAsked about the prevalence of wind and overcast: He said: The east is naturally windy, as seen in coastal prefectures where winds are extreme. They arrive as expected—spring brings east winds, summer brings south winds. Open land without mountains to obstruct them allows winds to arrive from their respective directions. Wind arises from the waxing and waning of yang qi: it stirs at dawn as yang ascends, peaks at noon, weakens in the afternoon, and ceases by evening. As for the west’s frequent overcast, it is not merely due to high mountains blocking the sky—yang qi naturally declines there. When the sun reaches its zenith there, it is already late in that region, and soon it sets, so the western lands seldom see the sun. The ancients said: “In Shu, the sun melts snow”; they also called it “the leaking sky,” for the sun is rarely seen. Observing heaven and earth thus, one sees they are not so vast. This can be verified through the sun, moon, cold, heat, wind, and overcast.\n\nTang scholar Jia Gongyan said: When the Duke of Zhou established Luoyang, he sought the land’s center and erected five gnomons. The central gnomon was placed in Yangcheng, Yingchuan. The site where shadows were measured still bears ancient traces. A thousand *li* south of the central gnomon, another was placed; a thousand *li* north, another; and a thousand *li* east and west of the center, two more were placed—this was the method for aligning the sun’s shadow to determine the center.\n\nFurthermore, Master Zhu noted: People today no longer use a single earthen gnomon. Zheng Kangcheng also erred in assuming the gnomon’s length was used to measure qi. It was made of jade, one *chi* long and one *cun* wide. A gnomon was sought where the shadow’s length, measured by the jade gnomon, matched one *chi* and five *cun*—this was the land’s center. If the shadow lengthened, the gnomon’s shadow shortened; if the shadow shortened, the gnomon’s shadow lengthened. At the winter solstice, the gnomon’s shadow extended over thirteen *chi*. Now, the land’s center differs from ancient times.\n\nThe city of Hanyang was deemed the center of the earth; the Yue Terrace of the Song dynasty was likewise considered the center; today, it lies in Xunyi, the old Kaifeng County.\n\nIn the twelfth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, envoys were dispatched throughout the realm. They observed the sun’s shadow from Linyi in the south to Hengye in the north, and determined that the Yue Terrace in Xunyi stood at the midpoint between the northern and southern arcs, thus marking the earth’s center. When the Great Zhou established its capital at Bian, it erected a jade gnomon and placed an arrow to measure the Yue Terrace. When the shadow’s length aligned with the center of the graduated scale, the solstice arrived, and the qi responded accordingly.\n\nLu Xiangshan said: A vessel of bronze served as the clepsydra, and a floating arrow marked the divisions. The day comprises twelve earthly branches, eight celestial stems, and the four cardinal directions; the year, twelve months and twenty-four solar terms. By measuring the sun’s shadow with a jade gnomon and discerning directions with a lodestone, the twenty-four positions were thus rectified. As the sun’s path shifts north and south, day and night vary in length, and so twenty-one arrows were established. South of the Yue Terrace, three relocations were made, rendering six arrows unusable; north of the Yue Terrace, three relocations were likewise made, and six arrows were also discarded due to the stems and branches. Occasionally, the shadow fell ahead or behind, or straddled two positions where the lodestone pointed—some took it as the third division of *chén* or the seventh of *bǐng*, others as the midpoint between *bǐng* and *wǔ*—yet there remained a fixed principle. Since the time of the Duke of Zhou, this method of correlating yin and yang has persisted, and scholars ought to heed it.\n\nHe further stated: Heaven envelops earth, and the heaven of earth moves within the earth’s center. Zhang Hengqu said: Earth, in relation to heaven, is but a single object within it—nothing more. Thus, the One vast and great is called heaven; the Two, small, is called earth.\n\nHe also said: The body of heaven is high in the north and low in the south, while the body of earth lies level within it. Shaozi remarked: Heaven covers earth, and earth bears heaven. Above heaven lies earth, and above earth lies heaven—yet men dwelling on earth perceive it not.\n\nHe further said: Heaven is round like a ball of qi, with earth slanting across its midst. Heaven’s expanse is boundless, yet the void within is finite. Like a hollow sphere in space, viewed from within, one faces east while the sphere turns west, and heaven rotates leftward. Yet the stars and the Pole share a single aspect, while the Four Movements press against the four limits and halt. Observing the *Xiantian Diagram*, from *Lin* upward, each set of sixteen hexagrams represents the heaven of heaven and the heaven of earth, encompassing the reckonings of *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* within heaven. From *Tongren* and *Dun* downward, each set of sixteen hexagrams represents the earth of heaven and the earth of earth, encompassing the reckonings of years, months, days, and hours within earth.\n\nHe also said: The positions on earth remain fixed and unchanging, while the celestial images revolve without cease. Only when the *Chunhuo* of heaven aligns with the *wǔ* position of earth do they converge, attaining the proper motion of heaven.\n\nZhu Xi said: In heaven, the twelve conjunctions are called *chén*. In the eleventh month, the *chén* resides in *Xingji*; in the twelfth month, in *Xuangan*; in the first month, in *Zouzi*; in the second month, in *Jianglou*—and so forth. If viewed from earth, standing facing south, the four directions and twelve *chén* positions likewise correspond, fixed and unchanging. Thus, the celestial sphere spans 365¼ degrees, with the twenty-eight lunar lodges arrayed to manifest the body of heaven and define the four directions. As heaven encircles earth, in one day and night it completes a full revolution, advancing by one degree. The sun, moon, and five planets likewise revolve around earth with heaven. Yet only the sun’s motion completes one circuit each day, neither exceeding nor falling short; the others vary in speed. Though suspended, they are neither affixed nor propelled, but rather, where their qi is abundant, their spirit naturally flourishes, each following its own order.\n\nHe further said: Heaven is deficient in the northwest, and earth incomplete in the southeast. Thus, the southeast abounds in water, while the northwest teems with mountains. The *Suwen* commentary states: The terrain of the Central Plains is high in the northwest and low in the southeast. The *Hetu Kuodi Xiang* says: The northwest is the Gate of Heaven, the southeast the Door of Earth. The Gate of Heaven has no above, the Door of Earth no below. Heaven descends from above to enter ten thousand *li*.\n\nHe also said: South of the sun’s zenith lies fifteen thousand *li*. Measured from the earth’s center, north and south, east and west each span thirty thousand *li*. Earlier scholars observed: The mountains and rivers of the Central Plains all originate in the northwest. Thus, those who describe mountains and rivers begin in the northwest and proceed southeast. Mountains and rivers on earth are like blood vessels in man—some lie close yet unconnected, while others distant are linked. Hence it is said: How could the Yangtze and seas sever the earth’s veins?\n\nCai Shi said: The great Yellow River and the northern mountains—all their roots and ridges stem from Dai in the north. The mountains of Wutai and Xian rise from lofty heights. The waters west of the ridge flow westward into the upper reaches of the Yellow River beyond Longmen. Those east of the ridge flow eastward as the Sanggan, forming the rivers of You and Ji, and empty into the sea. One western branch becomes the Kongkou Great Range; the next branch encircles the northern banks of Fen and Jin; another becomes the Taihang; yet another, the Hengshan—these form the northern range. The southern range comprises the mountains and rivers south of the Yangtze and Han. The veins of Mount Min divide: one northern branch becomes Mount Heng, ending west of Dongting; the southern branch crosses the Gui Range, passes north through the lands of Yuan and Jun, and reaches De’an, where it is called *Fuqian Plain*—some say it is today’s Lushan in Jiangzhou. Between these two branches, the Xiang River interrupts the connection. Mount Heng lies southeast of the Xiang, while *Fuqian Plain* lies northeast.\n\nThe origins and flows of these mountains and rivers may be traced. Master Zheng takes Mount Yan and Mount Qi as the true northern range, listing the regions through which the Yellow and Ji Rivers pass. Mount Xiqing forms the northernmost range, listing the regions through which the Yi, Luo, Huai, and Wei Rivers flow. Mount Fan Zhong serves as the secondary southern range, listing the regions through which the Han River flows. The Min River marks the true southern range, listing the regions through which the Yangtze flows.\n\nThe *Records of the Western Regions* states: The Yellow River has two sources. One emerges from the Congling Range; the other from Khotan, where two rivers converge and flow eastward into Lop Nur—also called the Salt Marsh—over three hundred *li* from the Yumen and Yang Passes. Its waters remain constant through winter and summer, flowing hidden beneath the earth before reemerging south at Jishi. Master Cheng says: Before the Nine Rivers were submerged by the sea, the land extended five hundred *li* northeast from the present coastline. The Yellow River branched into nine channels, entering the sea near Jieshi, which lay on the northwestern shore. Today, in the lands of Yan and Ji, no such stone remains, yet due south of Pingzhou, a mountain called Mashi stands in the sea, over five hundred *li* from the shore—this is precisely where the ancient Yellow River vanished into the sea. Wang Heng of the Han said: Once, the heavens sent continuous rain and a northeast wind, causing the sea to overflow and flood hundreds of *li* southwest. Thus, the Nine Rivers and Jieshi were engulfed by the sea. Later scholars sought the Nine Rivers on flat land but failed to verify the existence of Jieshi, leading to conflicting accounts and no resolution.\n\nThe *Tang Fa Xiang Zhi* states that the celestial patterns of the world’s mountains and rivers reside in the Two Boundaries. The Northern Boundary begins at Sanwei and Jishi, supporting the northern network of the Zhongnan Range, extending to Huimo and Chaoxian—this is called the Northern Ridge, by which Heaven restrains the Rong and Di. The Southern Boundary begins at Mount Min and Fan Zhong, supporting the southern network, extending to Dong’ou and Minzhong—this is called the Southern Ridge, by which Heaven restrains the Man and Yi.\n\nThe *River Sources* says: The Northern River flows from the head of the Northern Ridge to Huayin, where it meets the earth’s network. It then divides and flows eastward, with the Jing, Wei, Ji, and Zi Rivers forming its outer and inner courses. The *Yangtze Sources* says: The Southern River flows from the head of the Southern Ridge to Huayang, where it meets the earth’s network. At Mount Jing, it divides and flows eastward, with the Han River, Huai River, and Zi River forming its outer and inner courses. Observing the patterns of the Two Rivers and the beginning and end of the Milky Way, the celestial divisions become clear.\n\nThe Southern and Northern Boundaries are how Heaven demarcates the lands of the Central Hua. The Southern and Northern Rivers serve as the warp and weft to the mountains of the Two Boundaries. Within them, the states where civil and martial arts flourish, where commerce and resources abound, all nurture the people, complete the work of creation, and establish the realm of Chinese sovereigns, ministers, fathers, sons, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. In the universe, nothing is greater than Heaven, nothing deeper than Earth, and nothing more abundant than water. The essence of water rises as the Milky Way and flows downward as the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The moon’s reflection mirrors the forms of mountains and rivers, and water contains the patterns of the stars—all are the creations of a single *qi*. Recognizing the veins of mountains and rivers within the Two Boundaries, discerning the rise and fall of the Dipper and Net in the four directions, and correlating them with the ancient Han commanderies and kingdoms, the divisions of celestial regions become as clear as the lines on one’s palm—such is the grand pattern of mountains and rivers.\n\nIn terms of celestial correspondences, the Northern Boundary aligns with the Ximu constellation, while the Southern Boundary aligns with Xingji. As for the Quail’s Head, which governs the regions of Qin and Long, the heads of the Two Boundary mountains and rivers truly reside there. The ruler who harmoniously receives the pure and refined *qi* of the Central States, who grasps the celestial and terrestrial symbols of the Five Thearchs, and who governs the constant principles of the cosmic order may do so.\n\nThe Milky Way, extending from *kun* to *gen*, serves as the Earth’s network. The Northern Dipper, spanning from *qian* to *xun*, serves as the Heaven’s guiding principle. Their celestial divisions correspond to the regions of the Five Thearchs. *Kun* represents Earth, and the Milky Way is Earth’s *qi*. *Qian* represents Heaven, and the Northern Dipper is Heaven’s pole.\n\nThe Five Thearchs are: Shaohao of the Metal Virtue, Zhuanxu of the Water Virtue, Fuxi the Great Taihao of the Wood Virtue, Shennong the Lie Shan Clan of the Fire Virtue, and the Yellow Emperor of the Youxiong Clan of the Earth Virtue. Each of the Five Thearchs resides in one of the five directions, and their governance is said to revolve around the Xianchi.\n\nWhen governance resides in *qian* within the inner quadrant, it is Jiang Lou, corresponding to Shaohao, with its domain at the Northern Palace. When governance resides in *qian* within the outer quadrant, it is Zou Zi, corresponding to Zhuanxu, with its domain at Sheti. When governance resides in *xun* within the inner quadrant, it is Shouxing, corresponding to Taihao, with its domain at Taiwei. When governance resides in *xun* within the outer quadrant, it is Chun Wei, corresponding to the Lie Shan Clan, with its domain encompassing the Four Seas. The central pillar of governance is Xuanyuan, corresponding to the Yellow Emperor, with its domain at the handle of the Dipper governing externally. Chun Wei governs the southern maritime states, while the Dipper’s bowl governs internally. Zou Zi governs the central states surrounded by conflict. The remaining constellations: eight lie on the yin side of the Milky Way, governing maritime states; four lie on the yang side, governing states surrounded by conflict.\n\nThe world’s mountains divide into four ranges, corresponding to the twenty-eight constellations. The first range includes Mount Yan, Mount Qi, Hukou, Mount Leishou, Mount Taiyue, and Dizhu—these are the eastern constellations. Next are Jiang Lou and Xugan, supporting the Eastern Sea. The spirit of Mount Tai presides, called Jupiter.\n\nThe second range includes Mount Xicheng, Mount Wangwu, Mount Taihang, Mount Heng, Mashi, Mount Xiqing, and Zhu Yu—these are the northern constellations. Next are Daliang and Ximu, supporting the Northern Sea. The spirit of Mount Heng presides, called Mercury.\n\nThe third range includes Mount Wushu, Mount Taihua, Mount Xiong’er, Mount Waifang, Mount Tongbai, Mount Fan Zhong, and Pei Wei—these are the western constellations. Next are Chun Shou and Shi Shen, supporting the Western Sea. The spirit of Mount Hua presides, called Venus.\n\nThe fourth range includes Mount Jing, Mount Neifang, Mount Dabie, Mount Min, Mount Heng, the Nine Rivers, and Fuqian Plain—these are the southern constellations.\n\nNext are Xingji and Chunwei, supporting the Southern Sea. The spirit of Mount Heng presides, called Mars.\n\nThe Central States reside at the center of the world. Next are Chunhuo, Dahuo, Shouxing, and Shivei. The spirit of Mount Song presides, called Saturn. These are lands that rely on strategic terrain and martial prowess.\n\nIn celestial terms, this is Hongnong, where the division of Shan forms the convergence of the Two Rivers. West of Shan lies Qin and Liang. The northern bend of mountains and rivers marks the land of Jin, while the southern bend marks Ba and Shu—these are lands where culture and strategy contend.\n\nEast of Shan, the Three Rivers converge, with the Central Peak forming Chengzhou. To the west, it extends to Waifang and Mount Da Ren; to the north, it crosses the Ji and reaches south of the Huai; to the east, it stretches to Ju Ye—these are the lands of Song, Zheng, Chen, and Cai. North of the Yellow River and south of the Ji lie Yu, Wei, and Di. East along the Huaiyin lies Shen and Sui—these are lands where commerce and wealth flourish.\n\nThe northern bend extends east to the Northern River, where north lies Xing and Zhao. The southern bend extends east to the Southern River, where south lies Jing and Chu. Downstream from the Northern River, south to Mount Tai, lies the land of Qi; flanking Ma Shi to the right lies northern Yan. Downstream from the Southern River, north to Mount Tai, lies Zou and Lu; south across the Jiang and Huai lies Wu and Yue—these are the lands bordering the sea.\n\nOther features, such as the nine strategic passes, the nine bends of the Yellow River, the nurturing waters of Sanwei, the nine twists of the Min River, all correspond to the constellations above.\n\nThe *He Luo* chapter states: \"The central star of the celestial pole is the dwelling of Kunlun. The Heavenly Gate and Bright Hall are the essence of Mount Tai.\"\n\nZhang Heng said: \"In heaven, images take form; on earth, shapes manifest. Heaven has nine positions; earth has nine domains. Heaven has three luminaries; earth has three terrains—all can be pointed to and spoken of.\"\n\nIf one pursues this to its utmost, the eight extremities span a diameter of 220,2300 li. The distance from north to south is shorter by a thousand li, while east to west is broader by a thousand li. From earth to heaven is half the span of the eight extremities, and the depth of the earth is the same. Measuring this comprehensively, the calculations employ the double-gougu method: the shadow of the suspended heaven and the principle of the earth’s surface both shift by one cun for every thousand li. Beyond this, what lies further remains unknown. What remains unknown is called the cosmos. The bounds of space are infinite; the origins of time are without end—inexhaustible and unknowable.\n\nI have examined the realms above and below, consulting ancient records, and provisionally speak of the lands under the rule of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as measured by the steps of Da Zhang and Kui Hai. Confucius described these lands as: \"North to Youling, south to Jiaozhi, west treading the Flowing Sands, east reaching the Coiling Tree.\" Heaven and earth converge, and the finest qi gathers. The Yellow River reveals its numinous power, and the *River Chart* and *Luo Writ* emerge. Thus, the most refined of humanity become sages, and the Zhou and Confucius arose as the masters of China’s rites, music, and civilization, inheriting the legacy of Fuxi and the host of sages.\n\nZou and Lu abound in refined scholars; Yan and Zhao teem with heroes. East and west of the mountains, generals and ministers arise—all working together to weave the fabric of the Central States.\n\nYu inherited the prosperity of Yao and Shun, pacifying the Nine Provinces, and the jade and silk of ten thousand states were settled. The arable land totaled 9,108,024 qing. The lands rising above water spanned 8,000 li; the lands receiving water spanned 8,000 li. Famous mountains numbered 5,350, extending 64,050 li. Copper-producing mountains numbered 467; iron-producing mountains numbered 3,609. Commerce thrived through men plowing and women weaving. By not encroaching on their time, wealth and resources were ensured. Frugality left surplus; extravagance brought insufficiency. The public treasury held thirty years’ reserves; private households stored nine years’ provisions.\n\nAt the height of Chengzhou’s prosperity, the population numbered 22,704,923—161,000 more than in Yu’s time. Thereafter, through the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties, abundance and scarcity fluctuated. To the present day, the realm is unified, surpassing the primordial chaos to merge the subtle and indistinct, reaching the limits of heaven and earth. None fail to revere and cherish it, allowing one to trace the footsteps of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors.\n\nZhu Xi said: \"The *River Chart* speaks of Kunlun as the center of the earth. Beneath the earth lie eight pillars, mutually restraining one another. Famous mountains and great rivers, with their caverns and channels, are interconnected.\"\n\nThe *Commentary on Sima Xiangru’s Biography* states: \"Kunlun Mountain lies 50,000 li from China, spanning 10,000 li in breadth and height, rising 80,000 ren. Its layered cities have nine tiers, with nine wells on each face, jade railings, and five gates on the sides—it is the lower capital of the Celestial Emperor.\"\n\nThe *Water Classic* says: \"Kunlun lies 50,000 li from China, and the mountain itself spans 11,000 li.\"\n\nHu Yongzhi asked: \"Where does Tianzhu lie? Its lands produce many extraordinary people.\"\n\nZhu Xi replied: \"China lies 20,000 li from Yutian, and Yutian is another 30,000 li from Kunlun without further barriers.\"\n\nThe *Wenchang Miscellany* records that envoys from Yutian came to pay tribute, stating that 1,300 li west of their country lay Kunlun Mountain. Thus, China lies to the southeast of Kunlun, while the lands of Tianzhu lie directly to its south. The Yellow River flows from the southeast of Kunlun into China. In this way, Kunlun lies to the southwest of Tianzhu.\n\nThe *Qian Book* states: \"Mount Aru is Kunlun. At its summit lies the great Aru Pool, whose waters divide and flow in four directions. The stream entering China becomes the Yellow River, flowing into the Eastern Sea. The other three streams each enter the Southern, Western, and Northern Seas, like the Weak Waters and Black Waters.\"\n\nGenerally, the earth’s shape resembles a steamed bun, with its pointed tip being Kunlun. China’s terrain is perfectly round, and the people born there are likewise round and upright in form. Its geography benefits from the central qi of heaven and earth. Other worlds are shaped with slanted, pointed, or incomplete forms, encircling it externally, lacking the uprightness of heaven and earth. The people born there are often likewise unbalanced.\n\nThis is the theory of the beneficent heavens. Master Hengqu also subscribed to this view, stating:\n\nAncient records say: \"The northwest abounds in mountains, with Kunlun as their ancestral root. Its ridge spans the cosmos, and the Five Peaks and Three Crossings stretch across it in interlocking grandeur.\" It is also said: \"The Yellow River issues from Kunlun, the highest point on earth. Looking northward toward the sandy lands, no natural barriers obstruct the view. Should waters breach their bounds to the east and west, flooding would easily ensue. Yu dredged the Nine Rivers to temper their surging waves.\"\n\nIt further states: \"Mount Song is not the center of heaven but the center of earth. The Yellow Path and Red Path both lie north of Mount Song. The Southern and Northern Poles are the pivots of heaven. Only this place remains unmoving, like the navel of a millstone. This is the central point of heaven.\"\n\nAccording to Master Shao: \"The origin of heaven and earth—does it not arise from the center? Where is the center of heaven? It is at the Celestial Pole. Where is the center of earth? It is at Mount Song. Only with the Celestial Pole as heaven’s center can calendrical calculations and seasonal divisions be derived. Only with Mount Song as earth’s center can directions be fixed and distances measured. Is not the *zi-wu* axis the center of heaven and earth?\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang is born at midnight, and half an hour past midnight marks the *zi* hour. Thus, *Qian* begins in *Kan* and ends in *Li*—this is why the Southern and Northern Poles alone serve as heaven’s pivot, unmoving. At the summer solstice, yin is born at noon, when the sun stands at the zenith. Thus, *Kun* begins in *Li* and ends in *Kan*—this is why the Yellow Path and Red Path also lie north of Mount Song, unwavering.\n\nOnly the central point of heaven and earth remains eternally fixed, and thus the sages emerge. They observe the great movements from the pivot of the celestial sphere, establish key principles to examine future trends, and derive all calculations from this foundation.\"\n\nSomeone once asked me: \"Can your *Xuanhun* chapter fully encompass the structure of heaven and earth?\" I replied: \"No. For celestial patterns, there are astronomers and historians; for geography, there are maps like the *Fingertip Atlas*; for the correspondence of clouds and stars to regions, there is Tang Yixing; for the twists and turns of waterways, there is Li Daoyuan. Yet all these are but descriptions of what has been observed, not the ultimate truth.\"\n\nThe *Tai Xuan* states: \"In accord with the *Xuanhun*, one moves without end, aligning with heaven’s pattern—its subtleties defy expression.\"\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Three, concludes.\n\n---\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Four\nCompiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu\n\n**Section Two**\n\nMaster Kong of the Tang said: \"Yin (陰) means 'shade'—yin qi resides within, concealed and sheltering. Yang (陽) means 'radiance'—yang qi extends outward, flourishing and manifest. Yang, as the odd, is qi; qi blends into oneness as chaos. It also becomes the sun, whose body is ever luminous, without waxing or waning. Yin, as the even, is form; form divides into self and other. It also becomes the moon, with its phases of darkness and renewal. Fuxi observed the numbers of yin and yang and drew one unbroken line to symbolize yang, one broken line to symbolize yin. Yang is singular and bestows; yin is dual and receives—yet both arise from the same qi. When active, it is yang; when receding, it is yin—these two are but one. When yang arrives, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. The life and death of the myriad things are governed by yang, thus all returns to the One.\n\nNow, heaven and earth were formed from the primordial splitting of yin and yang qi, establishing the great foundation as their master—this is the uncarved block. Then they became father and mother, giving birth to humans and creatures, undergoing endless transformations, branching into countless threads—yet none escape this origin. Thus, filling the cosmos, what is there that is not the qi of yin and yang? All things are bound to these two principles.\n\nAt the dawn of creation, form was shaped from qi, so yin and yang gave rise to heaven and earth. With form as the vessel for qi, heaven and earth in turn generate yin and yang. Dong Zhongshu of the Han first expounded yin and yang, becoming the model for Confucians. Confucians cannot be ignorant of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhou said: 'Water, though yin, is rooted in yang, for it arises from the One. Fire, though yang, is rooted in yin, for it arises from the Two.' Thus, Master Zhang said: 'The essence of yin and yang dwells within each other’s abode.'\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Master Zhou’s work revolves around the two poles of yin and yang. At the beginning lies the principle of ceaseless generation; at the end, the principle of settled order. Where generation occurs, life is spoken of; where order is fixed, death is spoken of. Before the Supreme Polarity (Taiji) divided, yin contained yang. After the Supreme Polarity divided, yang separated from yin. Yang submerged in yin becomes water; yin submerged in yang becomes fire.'\n\nMaster Zhang said: 'Qi, vast and boundless in the great void, rises and falls, soars and swirls, never ceasing. Here lies the mechanism of emptiness and fullness, movement and stillness—the origin of yin and yang, hardness and softness. That which floats upward is the essence of yang; that which sinks downward is the turbidity of yin. Their encounters and congealments become wind and rain, frost and snow. The fusion and solidification of mountains and rivers, the dregs and embers—all are teachings. Wandering qi, chaotic and intertwined, coalesces into substance, giving rise to the myriad distinct beings. The ceaseless cycling of yin and yang’s two poles establishes the great principle of heaven and earth.'\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Observe wandering qi horizontally; observe yin and yang vertically. Yin and yang are like a fan; wandering qi is like the wind it produces. Yin and yang are like a millstone; wandering qi is like the flour it grinds. Yin and yang are like the root of a tree; wandering qi is like its blossoms and fruit. There is no wandering qi apart from yin and yang. The void is qi—able to rise and fall, soar and swirl to generate the myriad things, though people do not see it. Like the five-colored dragon qi seen from afar, qi scatters forth, containing both essence and excess, thus beings possess bias and uprightness. Their encounters and congealments—above, this speaks of the two qi; below, it speaks of wandering qi. The character *shi* (始, beginning) here refers to the mother of all things. The refined all emerge from the excess. In the affairs of excess, there is nothing that is not the Dao of heaven—thus it is the supreme teaching.\n\nThe two qi within heaven and earth ceaselessly revolve, unconsciously giving rise to countless beings. Each obtains a nature and life, each possesses a form and substance—all formed from the convergence of this qi. Though this is so, the two poles of yin and yang, emerging in great swaths, remain unchanged.\n\nHe also said: 'No two things created by the Maker are alike. Though the myriad things are many, there is not one without yin and yang.' From this, we know that the transformations of heaven and earth arise from these two poles alone. Observe the sun and moon, male and female, yin and yang—if you see that not a single thing lacks yin and yang, even the most minute being has a front and back. If one speaks of movement, it is all one qi.\n\nThus, Master Zhu said: 'Yang alone cannot generate; yin alone cannot complete. The ceaseless flow of creation requires their joint operation. Like east and west, south and north standing together, their positions oppose. It is simply movement opposing stillness, bending opposing extension, one opposing two, the Dao opposing the vessel. There is back and front, above and below, center and periphery—no thing exists without opposition. Form casts a shadow; sound produces an echo.'\n\nCai Yuanyuan said: 'When beings are born, yin is still and yang is dynamic. The still often resides in seclusion; the dynamic constantly comes and goes. That which comes is *xi* (息, breath); breath is yang. That which goes is *xiao* (消, dissipation); yang dissipates into yin. Between dissipation and breath, transformations occur according to the proportion of yin and yang—this is the flowing yin and yang. After forms take shape, there are heaven and earth, sun and moon, male and female, yin and yang—these are the yin and yang of correspondence. In flowing yin and yang, only yang is active. In corresponding yin and yang, their functions are equal. Though their functions are equal, what is called yin here is not the yin of flow. Thus, even the slightest movement or growth in plants and creatures, though yin, depends on yang to arise. Only withered wood and dead ashes are purely yin.'\n\nHe also said: 'If the Two do not stand, the One cannot be seen. If the One cannot be seen, the function of the Two ceases.' And: 'The One gives rise to spirit; the Two give rise to transformation.' The Two are the waxing and waning, advancing and retreating of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Master Zhang’s words here are exceedingly precise. Without the One, the waxing and waning of yin and yang would have no means of manifestation.'\"\n\nWithout the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the One likewise cannot be seen. For yang does not stand alone—it necessarily attains its establishment through yin. Thus, yang takes yin as its foundation, while yin cannot manifest itself except by awaiting yang. Therefore, yin takes yang as its counterpart. Every movement and stillness, every advance and retreat, every cold and heat—all are the workings of yin and yang. Yet there is no agent acting upon them, nor is there a principle of two standing independently. Either yin prevails over yang, or yang prevails over yin. There is nothing that is not so, no time that is not so. Yin and yang are but a single ebb and flow: when advancing, it is called yang; when retreating, it is called yin. Yang’s retreat is yin’s arising—not that yang retreats and then some other yin arises. Viewing yin and yang as one is permissible, as is viewing them as two. In general, generation is always the work of a single yang. As yang grows by one part, yin arises by one part beneath it—not that when yang wanes, one seeks out yin to replace it. Thus, yang’s return is *fu* (復), the original state of things, while yin’s arising is *gou* (垢), a chance encounter. Yin and yang are the yin and yang within yang. When speaking of qi, yin and yang are primary; when speaking of hardness and softness, they are the yin and yang within form. Here, a thing is discernible as either hard or soft.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"At the juncture of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, there is no abrupt division, yet the principle of separation remains. Their ascending and descending, their life and death—these great distinctions cannot be absent.\" He also said: \"The movement of yin and yang—its rising and falling, its fullness and contraction—never ceases for even a moment. Yang is ever full, yin ever deficient. The slightest imbalance gives rise to ten thousand changes. It is like a turning millstone: though its teeth are uneven, once set in motion, endless variations emerge.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Yin and yang are the root of creation and cannot be without each other. Their waxing and waning follow a constant pattern, beyond human alteration. Yet yang governs life, yin governs death, and thus their categories admit distinctions of good and ill. In the *Yi*, the Sage, addressing their inseparability, clarifies them through attributes like strength and compliance, benevolence and righteousness, without partiality. But at the juncture of their waxing and waning, where good and ill diverge, he never fails to express his intent to uphold yang and suppress yin. Speaking of the natural qi of Heaven and Earth, they cannot be without each other. But speaking of the symbols of the noble and the petty, one would wish the world to be entirely noble, without a single petty man. When framed in terms of good and evil, as in *‘Treading on frost, solid ice arrives,’* the arising of a single yin is like the emergence of a thief. Yang is good, yin is evil; the noble and the petty, Heavenly principle and human desire—these contend in victory and defeat.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Why compare yin to the petty man? Viewed in isolation, it seems fine. But by category, though its outward form may be flawed, its essence remains sound.\" Master Yi Chuan said: \"The tenth month is called the yang month—one might doubt whether yang is present, yet yin is the same.\" The Sage did not speak of it thus. Cai Jitong disagreed, saying: \"Yin cannot contend with yang, just as Earth cannot match Heaven.\" Master Zhu remarked that the reason the Sage did not speak of it was that this itself reveals the Way of assisting and completing. For to restrain yin and advance yang, to foster the good and diminish the evil, to employ the noble and dismiss the petty—this is clearly evident. When yang transforms into yin, it is like a gradual shrinking away without a trace, hence it is called *transformation*. When yin transforms into yang, its momentum gradually grows, becoming more distinct, hence it is called *change*. When yin is less than yang, in qi, principle, and number, whether used wholly or partially, the difference lies here.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Yang is the function of the Dao; yin is the substance of the Dao. Yang employs yin, yin employs yang. When yang is taken as function, yin is honored; when yin is taken as function, yang is honored.\" Master Zhang said: \"Yang moves, yin is still; yang is noble, yin is base. Yin can never be spoken of on equal terms with yang. Yet when adapting to time and change, yang contains yin, yin contains yang, and they alternate in function. When yang is exhausted and yin is pure, Kun prevails; when yin is exhausted and yang is pure, Qian prevails.\"\n\nI say: In the *zi* month, the *si* month honors yang; in the *wu* month, the *hai* month honors yin. In terms of division, Qian is noble and Kun is base—they cannot be equated. In terms of the family, though father and mother are both honored, the mother can never be equated with the father, for there is no second supremacy. Master Cai said: \"Yang is not complete without yin, yin does not arise without yang, and yin and yang further rely on each other for function. Yet in qi, yang is the function, hence yang moves and yin is still. In form, yin is the function, hence yin is swift and yang is relaxed.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"When the Supreme Polarity divides, it is merely two yin and yang, which encompass all things under Heaven. The *Yi* does not depart from yin and yang; its thousand changes and ten thousand transformations are but these two. When yin qi flows, it becomes yang; when yang qi flows, it becomes yin. This single qi, in its waxing and waning, advancing and retreating, produces the boundless affairs of Heaven and Earth from ancient times to the present. Take day and night, cold and heat: one is horizontal, one is vertical. Viewed horizontally, the principle is uniform—left is yang, right is yin; front is yang, back is yin; facing is yang, turning away is yin; advancing is yang, retreating is yin; east and south are yang, west and north are yin; spring and summer are yang, autumn and winter are yin—all follow the same pattern. Viewed vertically, the principle is likewise uniform—above is yang, below is yin; facing upward is yang, covering is yin; ascending is yang, descending is yin; clear is yang, turbid is yin; great yang and small yin, high yang and low yin, beauty is yang, ugliness is yin. Extending this by category, there is nothing that is not so, no time that is not so. The more finely it is analyzed, the more subtle it becomes; the more deeply it is explored, the more boundless it grows.\"\n\nThe essence of yin and yang mutually conceals its nourishment.\nThe qi of yin and yang circulates in alternating arrival.\nThe substance of yin and yang—whether vertical or horizontal, curved or straight—is moved by none, restrained by none.\nIn heaven, yin and yang form images; on earth, hardness and softness form substance; in humans, benevolence and righteousness form virtue—all are none other than yin and yang.\n\nMaster Shao says: Yin takes yang as its body, and yang takes yin as its body.\nYang solidifies through yin, and the void relies on the solid to stand.\nYin awaits yang to manifest, and the solid emerges from the void.\nWhen yin reaches *Kun* (☷), it forms a body, and the twelve yang of *Qian* (☰) are entrusted therein—thus yang takes yin as its body.\nAfter thirty-one transformations emerge from *Kun* and culminate, spring and summer arise—then yin takes yang as its function.\nWhen yang reaches *Qian*, it forms a body, and the twelve yin of *Kun* are entrusted therein—thus yin takes yang as its body.\nAfter thirty-one transformations emerge from *Qian* and decline, autumn and winter arise—then yang takes yin as its function.\n\nIn heaven, yang moves and diminishes yin; on earth, yin moves and diminishes yang.\nAt the extreme of yin, the twelve residual yang of *Kun* ultimately complete *Qian*, yielding thirty-six yang.\nAt the extreme of yang, the twelve residual yin of *Qian* ultimately complete *Kun*, yielding thirty-six yin.\nFrom the yang of *Kun* arise *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶), totaling twenty yang; from the twelve yin of *Qian* arise *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱), totaling twenty yin.\nDispersing one into three marks the beginning of generation.\nCombined, they number thirty-two, with yin and yang each occupying half of the eight positions.\nFrom the twenty-eight yang of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* arises the thirty-six yang of *Qian*; from the twenty-eight yin of *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* arises the thirty-six yin of *Kun*.\nConverging three into one marks the culmination of generation.\nCombined, they number sixty-four, with yin and yang each occupying the full eight positions.\nThus, from the Beginning of Spring to the Beginning of Autumn, the sum of yang numbers is sixty-four, while yin numbers total thirty-two.\nFrom the Beginning of Autumn to the Beginning of Spring, the sum of yin numbers is sixty-four, while yang numbers total thirty-two.\nFour times eight is thirty-two, the completion of the four trigrams.\nEight times eight is sixty-four, the completion of the eight trigrams.\nThe left diagram shows thirty-two yang, the right thirty-two yin, dividing the bodies of heaven and earth—combined, they form the sixty-four hexagrams.\nAt the extreme of yang, no yin exists; at the extreme of yin, no yang exists.\n\nMaster Shao says: *Li* (☲) in the east and *Kan* (☵) in the west stand at the midpoint of yin and yang, serving as the gates of spring, autumn, day, and night.\nHe also says: Yang encroaches upon yin, and yin encroaches upon yang—thus *Kan* and *Li* occupy the midpoint.\nThe qi of the sixty-four precelestial hexagrams all arise from the center, with the eight trigrams corresponding to the twelve earthly branches.\n*Zi* (子), *Wu* (午), *Mao* (卯), and *You* (酉) are the four centers.\n*Qian* corresponds to *Wu*, *Kun* to *Zi*, *Li* to *Mao*, and *Kan* to *You*.\nThus it is said: *Qian* and *Kun* establish the positions of above and below; *Kan* and *Li* arrange the gates of left and right—this is their proper alignment.\nThe trigrams of the four corners are: *Dui* (☱) at *Chen* (辰) and *Si* (巳), *Zhen* (☳) at *Chou* (丑) and *Yin* (寅), *Xun* (☴) at *Wei* (未), *Gen* (☶) at *Shen* (申), and *Xu* (戌) and *Hai* (亥).\nMaster Shao further says: *Kan* and *Li* mark the boundary of yin and yang.\n*Li* corresponds to *Yin* (寅), *Kan* to *Shen* (申)—those who examine the numbers often verify this as the overflow of yin and yang.\nThis means that the application of numbers does not exceed the center, with *Yin*, *Shen*, *Si*, and *Hai* occupying the heads of the four seasons.\n*Qian* corresponds to *Si* and is born at *Si*; *Kun* corresponds to *Hai* and is born at *Hai*.\n*Li* corresponds to *Yin* and is bounded by the midpoint of the three yang; *Kan* corresponds to *Shen* and is bounded by the midpoint of the three yin—when centered, they exceed their bounds and overflow.\nMoreover, as qi waxes and wanes, the remainder is six.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"At midday, it turns back; when the moon is full, it wanes.\"\nThis also reflects Master Shao’s caution regarding excess, retreating one position to reside in *Mao* (卯), *Chen* (辰), *Dui* (☱); *Zi* (子), *Chou* (丑), *Zhen* (☳); *Wu* (午), *Wei* (未), *Xun* (☴); and *You* (酉), *Xu* (戌), *Gen* (☶)—all positioned where numbers fall short, not exceeding the center.\nThus, the midpoint of *Kan* and *Li* corresponds to the midpoint of yin and yang.\nIf *Kun* is taken as the midpoint of *Zi*, then *Mao* and *You* are centered.\nTherefore, *Mao* is the gate of the sun, residing on the left, where the great yang is born.\n*You* is the gate of the moon, residing on the right, where the great yin is born.\nAs the gates of spring, autumn, day, and night: at the spring equinox, yang is centered; at the autumn equinox, yin is centered.\nThus it is said: \"Midday and midnight are equal, as are day and night.\"\nThis is unlike the summer solstice, when daylight is longer, or the winter solstice, when night is longer.\nNot only do the sun and moon rise and set here, but all things are born into life and enter death within it.\n\nMaster Weng says: Though heaven and earth begin at *Yin* (寅), the opening of things reaches *Mao* (卯), where the gate is fully opened.\nThough they begin at *Xu* (戌), the closing of things reaches *You* (酉), where the gate is already shut.\nIn a year, there are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in a month, there are crescent, full, waning, and new moons; in a day, there are dawn, day, dusk, and night.\nThough all depend on the functions of *Kan*, *Li*, the sun, and the moon, none occur without the gates of left and right.\n\nMaster Zhang says: *Li* corresponds to *Mao* and ends at *Shen*—this is the division of day.\n*Kan* corresponds to *You* and ends at *Yin*—this is the division of night.\nHe also says: *Li* corresponds to *Yin*, *Wei* (未), and *Mao*, where it is already bright; *Kan* corresponds to *Shen*, *Si* (巳), and *You*, where it is not yet dark.\nHeaven overcomes earth to create the surplus, so daylight is always longer than night by five *ke*—*Li* yang encroaches upon *Kan* yin, and daytime yang encroaches upon nighttime yin.\nIn my humble opinion, speaking of the greater numbers: things open after the Waking of Insects (*Jingzhe*) and close before the Beginning of Winter (*Lidong*)—yin and yang mutually encroach upon one another.\nThus, *Qian* is fully used, *Kun* is fully unused, and *Kan* and *Li* are half-used.\nThe two hexagrams *Kan* and *Li* are the intermingling of the middle lines of *Qian* and *Kun*.\nIn the precelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Mao* and *You* as the sun and moon.\nIn the postcelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Zi* and *Wu* as water and fire.\nOnly these four positions are most excellent: within yang there is yin, and within yin there is yang—such are the subtle intentions of Fu Xi and King Wen.\n\nThe other hexagrams, if not biased, become mixed. Master Zhu said: The Five Phases mutually serve as yin and yang, and each also has its own yin and yang. Spring is *lesser yang*, summer is *greater yang*. Autumn is *lesser yin*, winter is *greater yin*. This is spoken in terms of their flow through the four seasons. From the perspective of a year, six months are yang and six months are yin. A day is likewise: daytime is yang, night is yin; before noon is yang, after noon is yin. In a month, the period before the full moon is yang, and after the full moon is yin. In the *six jia* cycles, *jiazi* is yang, *yichou* is yin. Speaking in divisions, *jia* is yang and *zi* is yin. From ancient times to the present, there has only been ceaseless gathering and dispersing, bending and extending, cycling without end. What causes this? Heaven and Earth are one great yin and yang, and a year, a month, a day, an hour—all flow forth from within them.\n\nMoreover, spring is the beginning of yang, summer is the extreme of yang. Autumn is the beginning of yin, winter is the extreme of yin. When yang begins, there is warmth; when yang reaches its extreme, there is heat. When yin begins, there is coolness; when yin reaches its extreme, there is cold. Warmth gives rise to things, heat makes things grow. Coolness gathers things, cold destroys things. These are the transformations of the single *qi*.\n\nYang arises from below and ascends, thus advancing to generate things. Yin arises from above and descends, thus retreating to complete things. Yang resides in the southeast, governing spring and summer to give life. Yin resides in the northwest, governing autumn and winter to destroy. This is the general outline.\n\nMaster Shao said: *Greater yang* becomes the sun, *greater yin* becomes the moon. *Lesser yang* becomes the stars, *lesser yin* becomes the celestial bodies. Their transformations give rise to heat and cold, day and night, rain and wind, dew and thunder.\n\nSomeone asked about thunder, wind, rain, snow, frost, clouds, and dew. Master Zhang replied: When yin *qi* congeals and yang is trapped within unable to emerge, it struggles and strikes to become thunder. When yang is outside and unable to enter, it revolves ceaselessly to become wind. Their gatherings vary in distance and fullness, thus wind and thunder differ in magnitude and intensity. When dispersed gently and harmoniously, they become snow, frost, rain, and dew; when dispersed disharmoniously, they become perverse *qi* and yin haze. Yin constantly disperses and receives exchange from yang, thus wind and rain are regulated and cold and heat are balanced.\n\nHe also said: When yang is burdened by yin, they contend to form rain. When yin descends and yang obtains it, it scatters and rises as clouds. Thus, the patterned distribution of cloud things across the great void is yin driven by wind, gathered but not yet dispersed.\n\nSomeone asked Master Shao about rain, wind, clouds, and thunder. He answered: Yang obtaining yin becomes rain; yin obtaining yang becomes wind. Hard obtaining soft becomes clouds; soft obtaining hard becomes thunder. Without yin, there can be no rain; without yang, there can be no thunder. Rain, being soft, belongs to yin and awaits yang before arising. Thunder, being hard, belongs to yang and awaits yin before erupting.\n\nMaster Zhang explained: When yang leads and yin follows, flowing together, it becomes rain. When yin obstructs and yang presses, scattering, it becomes wind. When hard leads and soft follows, steaming, it forms clouds. When soft stores and hard moves, striking, it forms thunder. Whether as guest or host, preceding or following, yin and yang act in opposition or accord—these differ.\n\nWind and rain descend from heaven, thus they are spoken of in terms of yin and yang. Clouds and thunder rise from earth, thus they are spoken of in terms of soft and hard. Heaven’s yang, without yin, cannot form rain. Earth’s yin, without yang, cannot produce thunder. Rain, being yin in form and soft, originates from heaven’s yang *qi*. Thunder, being yang in sound and hard, emerges from earth’s yin body. Yin and yang mutually employ one another.\n\nSomeone asked Master Cai Jieqai about the line images of the eight hexagrams. He answered: When *Kan* yin is obtained by yang, it ascends as clouds; if yang is shallow, it becomes mist. When *Kan* yang is burdened by yin, it streams as rain; if yin is shallow, it becomes dew. When yin is outside and yang cannot emerge, it becomes thunder. If yin is solid, it becomes an earthquake—this is *Zhen*. When yin is inside and yang cannot enter, it becomes wind. If yin is solid, it becomes a great wind—this is *Xun*. When yang envelops yin, *Li* becomes sleet; when yang harmonizes with yin, it becomes snow—this is *Li* intersecting *Kan*. When yin envelops yang, *Kan* becomes thunder; when yin enters yang, it becomes frost—this is *Kan* intersecting *Li*. When the essence of yin and yang mutually reside in each other’s abodes, *Li* becomes the sun and *Kan* becomes the moon. When yin and yang clash, it becomes lightning; when yin and yang are out of place, it becomes a rainbow.\n\nHe also said: *Qi* ascends from *zi* to *wu* and descends from *wu* to *zi*. From *zi* to *yin*, it rises from within the earth to above the earth; from *mao* to *si*, it rises from within the earth to the midst of heaven. From *wu* to *shen*, it descends from the midst of heaven to above the earth; from *you* to *hai*, it descends from above the earth to within the earth.\n\nIn my humble observation: *Zi* and *wu* each have six, bounded by the earth. Yang arises from *zi* to *yin*, thus from the eleventh month to the first month, yang *qi* ascends above the earth. *Lesser yang* is seven, yang within yin. From *mao* to *si*, the second to the fourth month, it rises from within the earth to the midst of heaven. *Greater yang* is nine, yang within yang. Then, from the moment one yin arises at *wu* to *shen*, the fifth to the seventh month, yin *qi* descends from the midst of heaven to above the earth. *Lesser yin* is eight, yin within yang. From *you* to *hai*, the eighth to the tenth month, it descends from above the earth to within the earth. *Greater yin* is six, yin within yin. A day and a month are likewise.\n\nGenerally, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* correspond to the transitions of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Tai*, and *Pi*. The three yangs and three yins are all employed by heaven. *Zhen* is lesser, reaching *Qian* it becomes greater. *Xun* is lesser, reaching *Kun* it becomes greater. *Kan* and *Li*, with their four yins and four yangs, generate things in their midst. The three yins and three yangs oppose *Tai* and *Pi*. The six yins and six yangs oppose *Qian* and *Kun*. Like the number of water being six, as in snowflakes—six is not fabricated by humans; all things in creation are thus. From this, the marvel of yin and yang can be seen.\n\nHe also said: *Greater softness* becomes water, *greater hardness* becomes fire. *Lesser softness* becomes earth, *lesser hardness* becomes stone.\n\nTheir transformations manifest as creatures that run and fly, grasses and trees, colors and sounds, *qi* and flavors. The yang gives rise to mobile beings; the yin gives rise to rooted plants.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"It is fundamentally one principle, yet through waxing and waning, expansion and contraction, yin and yang arise. Even in the most minute and subtle things—grasses, trees, birds, and beasts—this holds true. For example, the carp bears thirty-six scales, a yin number. The dragon’s back bears eighty-one scales, a yang number. The tortoise’s shell has five segments at its center, corresponding to the Five Phases. On either side are four segments each, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams. Around the perimeter are twenty-four segments, corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms. As for grasses and trees—whether male and female, ginkgo and paulownia, hemp and bamboo—all follow this pattern.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Even dregs and ashes are nothing but teachings.\" I once applied the principles of the *Huangji Jingshi Shu* to deduce that there are creatures of flight—flying trees, flying grasses, flying creatures that run—and creatures of running—running fliers, running trees, running grasses, running runners. There are also tree-fliers, tree-runners, tree-grasses, tree-trees, as well as grass-fliers, grass-runners, grass-trees, and grass-grasses. Further, when divided by yin and yang, fliers belong to yang and runners to yin; mobile beings to yang and rooted plants to yin; horses to yang and oxen to yin; horns to yang and tails to yin. None escape the reckoning of yin and yang.\n\nGenerally, colors, sounds, *qi*, and flavors—each corresponds to the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and every thing possesses them. Yet some are partial and incomplete, while others are complete but ineffectual, as in the case of human intelligence.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Look near at the body, and the hundred principles are all present in the *qi* of contraction and extension—this can be seen in the breath between the nostrils. The nostrils are the Gate of Heaven, through which *qi* enters and exits.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"In terms of *qi*, exhalation is yang and pertains to expansion, while inhalation is yin and pertains to contraction. As with the breath through the nose, there is no moment without inhalation, no moment without exhalation. When exhalation is exhausted, inhalation arises; when inhalation is exhausted, exhalation arises.\"\n\nMinister Hu Wending said: \"In one day and night, a person takes 13,560 breaths.\"\n\nMaster Zhang of Hengqu said: \"The mingling of the *hun* gives rise to dreams, a tumult of a hundred sensations. Relative to waking, this is the day and night of the body. When *qi* presses forth, it is spring, and the myriad things intermingle. Relative to autumn, this is the day and night of heaven and earth.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is nature; movement and stillness, yin and yang, are the heart-mind. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The body and its blood and flesh are the Five Phases. Thus, when the eyes open, it is either yin or yang, either benevolence or righteousness. Advancing is yang; retreating is yin. In self-cultivation, one line is yin; in responding to affairs and engaging with things, it is yang. Another line states: that which is not yet settled belongs to yang; that which is settled belongs to yin.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Heaven has the four seasons; earth has the four directions; humans have the four limbs. The joints of the fingers can reveal heaven; the lines of the palm can discern earth. The principles of heaven and earth are fully present in the palm.\"\n\nThe exegete said: \"The hands face upward, aligned with heaven; the feet are square and face downward, aligned with earth. The hands can turn and flip, but the feet cannot—yang can encompass yin, but yin cannot encompass yang. The back of the palm is high, the front is low; the southeast has much water, the northwest has many mountains. Where they gather are rivers and marshes, and the lines in the palm resemble rivers and the shape of the hand. From the wrist to the elbow to the shoulder, and from the toes to the knee to the thigh and hip, there are three joints each, corresponding to the twelve stations. The four limbs correspond to heaven’s four seasons and earth’s four directions. The four fingers each have three joints, corresponding to the twelve earthly branches. Together, they correspond to the twenty-four solar terms. The thumb has three joints, two of which are yin and yang; the hidden one is the Supreme Ultimate, the great thing. Combined, they number thirty-two, corresponding to the heavenly hexagrams. Together with the hands and feet, they number sixty-four, encompassing the earthly hexagrams. The earth’s body culminates in sixteen; one hand has sixteen numbers, of which fifteen are manifest. The one is the Supreme Ultimate, hidden between the great things.\n\nEach of the four limbs has one vessel, corresponding to the four seasons. Each vessel has three sections, corresponding to the three months of a season. Each section has three periods, corresponding to the three ten-day weeks of a month. This is the *Qian* strategy.\n\nThe *Suwen* speaks of the twelve seasonal nodes, all of which communicate with heavenly *qi*. The twelve seasonal nodes correspond to the twelve meridians of the human body—referring to the three yins and three yangs of the hands and feet—and the three periods refer to the deep, floating, and middle yin and yang, which may be excessive or deficient.\n\nIt also states: \"Heaven and earth are but one *qi*. When divided into yin and yang, they become two things. Thus, yang is benevolence, and yin is righteousness. Yet yin and yang each further divide into two. Thus, the inception of yang is Wood, spring, and benevolence; the fullness of yang is Fire, summer, and propriety. The inception of yin is Metal, autumn, and righteousness; the extreme of yin is Water, winter, and wisdom. This encompasses the Three Powers and doubles them.\n\nWhen viewed as one *qi*, yin and yang may also be seen as two *qi*. They may be observed as they change with the seasons, or in the great openings and closings, the great waxings and wanings of the cosmos, as well as in the small openings and closings, the small waxings and wanings of the minute. Whether in the vast span of 129,600 years or in a year, a month, a day, or an hour, it is all thus. Though there may be ten thousand changes within, their principle remains constant and unchanging. Thus it is said: 'One yin, one yang—this is the Dao.' That which continues it is goodness; that which completes it is nature.\"\n\nHaving thoroughly studied this, one may fathom its depths.\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Four, concludes.\n\n**Tian Yuan Fa Wei, Scroll Five**\n\n*[Textual Notes:]*\n#4 Originally \"[又曰]\"; emended to \"Master Shao says\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#5 Originally \"匹\"; emended to \"four\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#6 Originally \"體\"; emended to \"one yang\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#7 Originally \"用阳\"; emended to \"awaits yin\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#8 Originally \"有\"; emended to \"with\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#9 This sentence appears as \"处已是阴\" in the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#10 \"爻\" is likely a superfluous character.\n#11 Originally \"支\"; emended to \"limbs\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#12 Originally \"夫\"; emended to \"Heaven\" following the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; collated by Fang Hui Wanli of Xugu.*\n\n**Expounding the Five [Phases]**\n\nMaster Zheng cites the *Baihutong*: \"Movement is the qi of Heaven’s activity.\" Water serves as the standard, for water lies in the Yellow Springs, nurturing all things with impartial constancy. Fire is transformation. When yang qi prevails, the myriad things undergo change. Metal is restraint. In autumn, the myriad things are constrained by yin qi. Wood is arousal. Yang qi stirs and leaps, bursting forth from the earth. Earth is spouting. Earth, dwelling at the center, universally brings forth the myriad things.\n\nThat which engenders things follows the numbers seven and eight of wood and fire. That which completes things follows the numbers nine and six of metal and water. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The essence of qi becomes things\"—the commentary notes seven and eight. \"The wandering soul undergoes change\"—the commentary notes nine and six.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] says: The Supreme Polarity arrays the Five [Phases] beneath yin and yang. The Five Constants are principle, while yin and yang are qi. Without qi, principle would have no place to stand; thus the Five Phases follow yin and yang. He further states: Righteousness and wisdom pertain to yin; benevolence and ritual pertain to yang. Yin and yang are qi, while the Five Phases are substance. With this substance, and with the qi of the Five Phases, things are thus produced.\n\nThis fool says: The Five Phases belong to the postnatal. If one inquires into the prenatal, the One is the Supreme Polarity. From the One dividing into two, there arises yin and yang. Yin and yang are the qi of the Five Phases; the Five Phases are the substantial forms of yin and yang. One, three, five, seven, and nine are the Five Phases of Heaven. Two, four, six, eight, and ten are the Five Phases of Earth. Two and five make ten; when yin and yang unite as one, they can engender and complete the myriad things. Thus above, the *Daybook* says: \"One is the Five Phases alone.\" Within the One there are two.\n\nJia (yang) and Yi (yin) form Wood; Bing (yang) and Ding (yin) form Fire; Wu (yang) and Ji (yin) form Earth; Geng (yang) and Xin (yin) form Metal; Ren (yang) and Gui (yin) form Water—these are of Heaven. Hai (yin) and Zi (yang), the north; Yin (yang) and Mao (yin), the east; Si (yang) and Wu (yin), the south; Shen (yang) and You (yin), the west; Chen (yang) and Xu (yang), Chou (yin) and Wei (yin)—these occupy the center and are of Earth. The spirit of Wood governs benevolence; the spirit of Metal governs righteousness; the spirit of Fire governs ritual; the spirit of Water governs wisdom; the spirit of Earth governs trust—these are of Man. Uniting the Three Powers as one, qi flows and principle likewise flows.\n\nMaster Zhou [Dunyi] says: Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth. Master Zhu says: The Five Phases’ substance resides in Earth, while their qi flows in Heaven. Speaking of their generative sequence in terms of substance, it is Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, Earth—here, Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin. Speaking of their operational sequence in terms of qi, it is Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water—here, Wood and Fire are yang, while Metal and Water are yin. For their transformations are boundless, and nowhere do they not follow the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nHe further states: Water’s yin is rooted in yang; Fire’s yang is rooted in yin. Interwoven, they give rise to life. In their cyclical movement, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood—thus they circulate in mutual flourishing. Again, Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Gui are all of this same thing.\n\nHuang Mianzhai says: The *Diagram Explanation* states that Water’s yin is abundant and Fire’s yang is abundant—this is their operational sequence, not their generative sequence. Viewed from the establishment of the *zi* [midnight] hour, Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin—this is their generative sequence. He further says: There is one point of doubt in the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity*. The diagram places Water, with its abundant yin, on the right, and Fire, with its abundant yang, on the left. Metal, being yin, follows Water; Wood, being yang, follows Fire—this explains their generative sequence. Yet the text below states that Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin, thus making Water yang and Fire yin. In considering the initial arising of things, they are naturally tender and immature. When yang first arises, as Water, it is still soft and weak; by the time Wood is engendered, it has grown strong. When yin first arises, as Fire, it is still faint; by the time Metal is engendered, it has taken form. Thus Water is yang in its inception, Wood is yang in its fullness, Fire is yin in its inception, and Metal is yin in its fullness.\n\nHe further states: The generation of the Five Phases, each with its own nature. In terms of qi and substance, Water’s nature is cold, Fire’s is hot, Wood’s is warm, Metal’s is frozen, and Earth’s is harmonious. When humans are born, they likewise differ in intelligence, foolishness, strength, and weakness according to the qi and substance they receive. Yet when each returns to its root, it possesses its own nature. This is what is meant by the Supreme Polarity’s wholeness being fully present within each thing. Thus humans, alone among beings, receive the finest essence of the Five Phases, and their minds are most numinous.\n\nMaster Cheng says: Kan is Water. The One begins at the center, being the first of the engendered. Heaven engenders Water with the One, so Water stands first among the Five Phases. When things first arise, their forms are all water. Water is one source of the myriad things, all rooted in the creative transformation of Heaven’s One. Even the production of metal and stone begins as a fluid. The qi of the first yang, the first hour of the day, the eleventh month of the year, and the Winter Solstice all commence at *zi*. *Zi* is the position of Water. Now, Water is engendered by yang yet completed by yin. When qi first stirs, yang arises; when qi gathers and stills, it becomes water—observe the breath, and it is visible. The inception of Water belongs to the One, hence it is subtle. When Water is formed, it becomes six.\n\nSomeone asked: Is there evidence for Heaven engendering Water with the One? The answer: The human body provides evidence. When the heart of hunger stirs, saliva is produced; when the heart of sorrow stirs, tears are produced; when the heart of shame stirs, sweat is produced; when the heart of desire stirs, essence is produced. When the human heart is quiescent and unmoving, it is the Supreme Polarity. When this heart stirs, the Supreme Polarity moves and yang arises. Thus when the heart stirs and Water is engendered, this can serve as evidence for Heaven engendering Water with the One.\n\nThe spirit governs qi, and when the spirit moves, qi follows. Qi is the mother of Water, and when qi gathers, Water is born.\n\nMaster Zhu said: In the sequence of the Five Phases, Wood is the beginning, Water is the end, and Earth is the center. According to the numbers in the *Diagram* and the *Book*, Water is one, Wood is three, and Earth is five—all odd numbers of yang’s generative sequence and unalterable. Thus they take turns as the principal, forming the warp of the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Phases: Spring begins with Wood in the East, Winter ends with Water in the North, and Earth presides in the center—this is the sequence of beginning, middle, and end. Yet the sequence of their generation all begins with Heaven.\n\nWater can moisten and nourish the myriad things; Heaven’s One first engenders Water. Water has the nature of steadfast stillness, firm and potent, concealed in Winter. Wood can warm and nurture the myriad things; Heaven’s Three engenders Wood. Wood has the nature of sprouting forth, inexhaustible and unrestrained, flourishing in Spring. Earth can bear and sustain the myriad things; Heaven’s Five engenders Earth. Earth is the mother of nurturance, upright and vast, dwelling in the center and flourishing in the four directions. Once these three are born, they ceaselessly generate, each occupying its own direction, immutable.\n\nThus we see Heaven’s heart of loving life: the source is upright, and the offspring are good—all are Heaven-born. Fire and Metal, however, are those within the Five Phases that rely on one another for transformation and cannot be absent for a single day, yet they are Earth-born.\n\nFire is born from Earth’s Two; its nature is to flame upward, sometimes existing from non-existence, sometimes non-existing from existence. Its position may be in the South or the West. Metal is born from Earth’s Four; its nature is to follow and reform, sometimes square made round, round made square. Its position may be in the West or the South. Thus the *Diagram* and the *Book* speak of rearrangement, unlike Water, Wood, and Earth, which are Heaven-born and have a fixed sequence.\n\nYet within this fixed sequence, the Five Phases ceaselessly generate, mutually permeating one another. Though the sequence is fixed, their qi is never unconnected. Thus Master Zhu said: They take turns as the principal, forming the warp of the Five Phases. He also said: Wood encompasses the Five Phases, for it flows through and penetrates all without exception.\n\nRao Shuangfeng said: Qi moves through Heaven with generation as its principal. Thus Master Zhu took Spring as the first of the four seasons, running through Summer, Autumn, and Winter. In humans, compassion is the first of the four beginnings, running through shame, deference, and right and wrong. For Spring can generate the myriad things, and compassion can embrace all virtues.\n\nMaster An said: When One is beneath Wood, it is the root—returning to the root and recovering the mandate, uniting with Five. When One is above Wood, it is the branch—sending forth limbs and leaves, scattering into the myriad. From One, know the myriad. Heaven’s One engenders Water and thus Wood—all share this One.\n\nHe also said: Water encompasses the Five Phases, for it returns to the root, restores the mandate, and conceals itself therein. Wood without Water withers, Fire without Water dries, Metal without Water stagnates. With Water to encompass them, they flow through the four seasons, animating the myriad things. When its work is done, it retreats and hides within the two yin, lying hidden at the Yellow Springs’ depths—thus it can return to the root and recover the mandate. When it emerges, it is once more primal and penetrating, like thunder shaking the earth and rain soaking the world.\n\nIn humans, it is the essence stored in the kidneys, moistening all the body. He also said: Earth is the lodging of Water and Fire, the resource of Metal and Wood, dwelling in the center and responding to the four directions—one body bearing the myriad kinds.\n\nRao Shuangfeng said: Substance resides in Earth, with nurturance as its principal. Thus Earth dwells at the center of the Five Phases, governing Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. In humans, the spleen dwells at the center of the five viscera, governing the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. For Earth can nurture the myriad things, and the spleen can nurture all forms.\n\nIn the last month of Summer, Earth is most flourishing, thus it can engender Autumn’s Metal. It also flourishes in the four seasons, each season for eighteen days, totaling seventy-two days. The other four Phases divide the four seasons, each also receiving seventy-two days, together making three hundred and sixty days.\n\nMaster Weng said: The Five Phases, separated from Earth, cannot each become a vessel. One united with Five becomes Water. Two united with Five becomes Fire. Three united with Five becomes Wood. Four united with Five becomes Metal. Five united with Five becomes Earth. Five is Earth, dwelling in the center. One, two, three, four, five—once five is reached, Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth are formed, called six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.\n\nHe also said: Heaven and Earth are the fixed forms of yin and yang’s opposition. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are the sequence of yin and yang’s flow. Without opposition, there can be no flow, and no transformation. Without flow, there can be no self-movement. Thus the Five Phases flow through Heaven and Earth to fulfill their function.\n\nIn transformation: One transforms into six, becoming Water. Two transforms into seven, becoming Fire. Three transforms into eight, becoming Wood. Four transforms into nine, becoming Metal. Five transforms into ten, becoming Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of oppositions. Next, the Five Phases each form their own oppositions. This is the *Yi* of exchange: Fire opposes Water, Metal opposes Wood. In opposition, there are two—this is the fixed form. In flow, there is circulation, and in circulation, there is one—this is the *Yi* of change.\n\nThe Five Phases generate one another: Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Metal again generates Water. In their opposition, each is half a body.\n\nIn circulation, all are complete bodies. In opposition and flow, each has its own sequence.\n\nSpeaking of a single *qi*: when exhalation reaches its extreme, it turns to waning; when waning reaches its extreme, it turns to exhalation. Speaking of two *qi*: when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises.\n\nSpeaking of the four seasons: that which is overcome becomes husband and wife; that which is generated becomes mother and child. The husband takes a wife, and the husband’s blood and *qi* daily diminish—thus summer transforms into autumn. The mother bears a child, and the child’s blood and *qi* daily flourish—thus winter changes into spring.\n\nSpeaking of the Five Phases: *wu* and *ji* inquire among the ten Celestial Stems; *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* inquire among the twelve Earthly Branches. The Center mediates between the four directions; *kun* inquires between *li* and *dui*. Fire generates Earth, and Earth generates Metal.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Yang transforms and yin unites, first giving rise to Water and Fire. Water and Fire are *qi*. Flowing and flickering, their forms remain insubstantial, their shapes not yet fixed. Next arise Metal and Wood, which are firmly established in fixed forms.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate beings, first the light and pure, then the heavy and turbid. Among the Five Phases, Water and Fire are the lightest and purest; Metal and Wood follow, while Earth is the heaviest and most turbid.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Water and Fire are *qi*. Thus Fire flames upward and Water moistens downward, ascending and descending with yin and yang. Earth cannot restrain them. Wood as a thing: when Water is clear, Fire is born, yet they do not part.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Zheng Meng* states only that the substantial forms of Metal and Wood belong to Earth, while Water and Fire do not belong to Earth. Someone asked: Since Fire arises attached to Water, does it not also belong to Earth? He replied: Fire is a thing of empty space. Asked: Is warmth and heat merely *qi* and thus Fire? He replied: Yes. The darkness within Fire is the yin within *li*. The clarity within Water is the yang within *kan*. Within Fire there is blackness—yin Water within yang. That which is black outside and bright inside is yang within yin. Thus Water may be called yang, and Fire may be called yin.\n\nMaster Zhang further said: When yang is submerged in yin, it becomes Water; when it clings to yin, it becomes Fire. Wood and Metal are the blossoms and fruits of Earth, their natures mingled with Water and Fire. Thus when Wood is steeped in Water, Fire is born, yet they do not part—further proof of Earth’s floating blossom at the intersection of Water and Fire. Metal obtains Fire’s essence from Earth’s dryness and Water’s essence from Water’s moisture. Thus Water and Fire sustain each other without harm; when smelted, they flow back without depletion—further proof of Earth’s essential solidity at the juncture of Water and Fire.\n\nHuang of Mianzhai said: Examining the initial generation of humans and things, Heaven’s one generates Water, and Water at once takes form. When humans are born, essence and blood unite to form the body, just as in creation there is Water. Earth’s two generates Fire, and Fire at once has *qi*. When humans have this body, they can produce sound. Sound is the work of *qi*, just as in creation there is Fire. Water is yin and Fire is yang; appearance also belongs to yin, while speech also belongs to yang. Though Water and Fire have form and substance, they arise at creation’s beginning. Thus Water only moistens, and Fire only flames—yet their forms remain light and pure. When Heaven’s three generates Wood and Earth’s four generates Metal, their forms and substances are fully complete, just as when the human body’s ears and eyes are formed, the human shape is complete. Wood is yang and Metal is yin, just as seeing is yang and hearing is yin.\n\nAt creation’s beginning, Heaven’s one generates Water, and three generates Wood; Earth’s two generates Fire, and four generates Metal. Heaven obtains one odd number and generates Water; one’s extreme is three, thus three generates Wood. Earth obtains two even numbers and generates Fire; two’s extreme is four, thus four generates Metal. The completion of Water at six resembles *kan*, with one yang residing within—Heaven’s one generates Water. Earth’s six envelops externally, with yang scarce and yin abundant, and Water begins to flourish and form. The completion of Fire at seven resembles *li*, with one yin residing within—Earth’s two generates Fire. Heaven’s seven envelops externally, with yin scarce and yang abundant, and Fire begins to flourish and form.\n\nSomeone asked: If one generates Water but Water is not yet complete, and two generates Fire but Fire is not yet complete, must one wait until the Five Phases are all present before six and seven complete Water and Fire? If so, creation would never be whole. Rather, the *qi* of Water and Fire are one moist and one dry. When Water’s moisture reaches its extreme, Wood is born; when Fire’s dryness reaches its extreme, Metal is born. The beginning of humans and things is merely the gathering of essence and *qi*. Essence is moist and *qi* is dry; essence sinks while *qi* rises. Thus essence becomes appearance, and *qi* becomes speech. When essence flourishes, moisture reaches its extreme—thus it becomes the eyes, the liver, and sight. When *qi* flourishes, dryness reaches its extreme—thus it becomes Metal, the lungs, and hearing. Generally, appearance and sight belong to essence, so when essence wanes, the eyes dim. Speech and hearing belong to *qi*, so when *qi* is obstructed, the ears grow deaf. This is clearly evident.\n\nPhysicians assign the ears to the kidneys and the lungs to Metal. Compared with this arrangement, there are differences.\n\nLiu of Yunzhuang said: Yin and yang are mutually rooted. Water resides in the *zi* position, the direction of extreme yin, yet yang is already born at *zi*. Fire resides in the *wu* position, the direction of extreme yang, yet yin is already born at *wu*. Wood, born from Heaven’s three, belongs entirely to yang, thus its movement in spring also belongs to yang. Metal, born from Earth’s four, belongs entirely to yin, thus its movement in autumn also belongs to yin. One cannot speak of them in terms of yin-yang mutuality, for Water and Fire have not yet parted from *qi*. At the beginning of yin-yang union, their *qi* naturally possesses the wonder of mutual rooting. Wood is yang’s expansion, and Metal is yin’s contraction—they have fixed substances. This is why they differ from Water and Fire.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Music* tones are Earth, Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire; the *Hong Fan* sequence is Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth.\n\nThe *Music* distinguishes the five tones as nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, and sixteen. The *Hong Fan* divides the four directions as one, two, three, four, and five.\n\nIt is further said: The *Hong Fan* speaks of one, two, three, four, and five, but does not mention six, seven, eight, nine, or ten. The *Monthly Ordinances* speaks of eight, seven, five, nine, and six, but does not mention one, two, three, four, or ten. The *Great Mystery* speaks of three, eight, four, nine, two, seven, one, six, and five, but does not mention ten.\n\nThe *Hong Fan* orders them as Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth; Yu orders them as Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth; Liu Xiang and Ban Gu order them as Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water; Fan Ye orders them as Wood, Metal, Fire, Earth, and Water.\n\nIt is also said: The five phases possess substance in Earth, while their *qi* moves in Heaven. Cai Jiufeng said: Flowing through the four seasons in Heaven, they are called the five phases; on Earth, where humans draw upon them, they are called the five materials. Tang scholar Kong said: The five phases are ordered from the subtle to the manifest. Water is the most subtle, thus ranked one; Fire gradually manifests, thus ranked two; Wood takes form and substance, thus ranked three; Metal is solid and firm, thus ranked four; Earth is vast and substantial, thus ranked five. This is verified by the *Hong Fan*.\n\nCai said: Moistening, flaming, bending-straightening, transforming, and sowing-reaping—these describe their natures by function and their virtues by capacity. Water moistens and flows downward; Fire flames and rises upward; Wood bends and straightens; Metal obeys and transforms; Earth encompasses the four directions and possesses the virtue of generation. Thus, its emphasis lies in sowing and reaping, for the people regard food as heaven.\n\nFeng said: Sowing is *jia* (planting), and reaping is *se* (harvesting). Cai’s commentary speaks of *jia* and *se* together to express their ceaseless generation.\n\nIt is further said: Salty, bitter, sour, pungent, and sweet—these are the flavors of the five phases. The five phases possess sound, color, *qi*, and flavor, but only flavor is mentioned here because it is most essential to human use. The five flavors are based on the five grains. According to the *Monthly Ordinances*, the correspondence of the five grains to the five phases is: wheat to Wood, millet to Fire, broomcorn millet to Earth, hemp to Metal, and beans to Water. In terms of the five livestock: goose to Wood, sheep to Fire, ox to Earth, dog to Metal, and pig to Water. In terms of the five fruits: chestnut to Water, plum to Wood, apricot to Fire, peach to Metal, and jujube to Earth. All these possess substance in Earth and are indispensable to human sustenance, not to be lacking even for a day. When this *qi* circulates in Heaven, it becomes the five phases; when this substance congeals on Earth, it becomes the five materials.\n\nHeaven has the sun, thus Earth has Fire. Heaven has the moon, thus Earth has Water. Heaven has rain, sunshine, cold, warmth, and wind, thus Earth has Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth. From Heaven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven, filling the cosmos—what is not of the five phases? Moreover, humans are born with the finest *qi* of the five phases; who does not rely on the five phases for use?\n\nShaozi said: Fire is born from non-being, Water from being. Fire is dark within and bright without, thus *li* (Fire) has yang on the outside. Fire’s function lies in its exterior. Water is dark without and bright within, thus *kan* (Water) has yang on the inside. Water’s function lies in its interior. Fire functions externally, symbolized by the eye; Water functions internally, symbolized by the ear. The interior is the body, the exterior is function. Water’s exterior is its body, its interior is function. Yang is function.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Yin takes yang as its substance, and yang takes yin as its substance. Water is bright within and dark without; Fire is dark within and bright without. The essence of yin and yang mutually abides in their dwellings.\n\nXishan’s Master Zhen said: The sun and Fire are the outer illumination; Metal and Water are the inner illumination—this originates from the *Huainanzi*. The clear and bright belong to the inner illumination of Metal and Water. The turbid and bright belong to the outer illumination of the sun and Fire. Some say: The sun and Fire radiate light externally, thus the sun may be eclipsed and Fire may be extinguished. Metal and Water conceal their light internally, thus they are inexhaustible. By this, one may withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing, concealing the spirit without display. This principle is wondrous and may be used for nurturing life. Yet in matters of governance, it is irrelevant. How can it compare to we Confucians, who, when it is time to be bright, act as *li* (Fire), and when it is time to be obscure, act as *mingyi* (Darkening)?\n\nIt is further said: Fire and the sun emit light externally, able to extend and bestow without limit. Metal and Water emit light internally, able to receive and adapt, each according to its capacity, to spirit and form. Is this not the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\n\nMaster Zhang said: Fire relies on Wood, and Wood generates Water; spirit rides *qi* and generates essence. In the prior Heaven, spirit generates essence—one gives birth to two. In the posterior Heaven, essence gathers spirit—two gives birth to one.\n\nI have pondered this and say: Water, rooted in yang within yin, is thus lesser yang, aging from spring to summer. Fire, rooted in yin within yang, is thus lesser yin, aging from autumn to winter. *Qian* and *Kun* possess the bodies of *kan* and *li*. *Qian*’s nine-two exchanges with *Kun* to form *kan*. Within *kan*, one yang is born at *zi*, becoming true Water—this is the true yang within yin. *Kun*’s six-two exchanges with *Qian* to form *li*. Within *li*, one yin is born at *wu*, becoming true Fire—this is the true yin within yang. Two are many, one is few—*kan* is one, *li* is two. The few govern, thus the many serve. The few govern, thus *kan* belongs to winter. The years, months, days, and hours it generates, from *zi* to *si*, are all yang. The many serve, thus *li* belongs to summer. The years, months, days, and hours it generates, from *wu* to *hai*, are all yin. Between Heaven and Earth, nowhere is not the function of Water and Fire. Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* entrust their true natures to *kan* and *li*, and *kan* and *li* serve *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nIt is further said: Clouds differ as Water, Fire, Earth, and Stone, and the types of Earth are likewise varied.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Water, Fire, Earth, and Stone are the bodies of Earth; all things possess Earth’s body.\n\nThe Master said: Water rains as drizzle, Fire rains as dew, Earth rains as mist, and Stone rains as hail.\n\nWater’s wind is cool, Fire’s wind is hot, Earth’s wind is mild, and Stone’s wind is biting.\nWater’s clouds are black, Fire’s clouds are red, Earth’s clouds are yellow, and Stone’s clouds are white.\nWater’s thunder is dark, Fire’s thunder is rumbling, Earth’s thunder is rolling, and Stone’s thunder is crashing.\nThus, a single thing necessarily connects to the Four Images.\n\nHeaven has the sun, moon, stars, and constellations; Earth has Water, Fire, Earth, and Stone.\nThe head has eyes, ears, mouth, and nose; the body has bones, flesh, blood, and marrow.\nMarrow is Fire, blood is Water, flesh is Earth, and bones are Stone—these are the Four Images of living beings.\nSap is Water, blossoms are Fire, branches are Earth, and roots are Stone—these are the Four Images of plants.\nEvery person’s exhalations—blowing, sniffling, sighing, and breathing—respond to Heaven’s winds, rains, clouds, mists, and thunders.\n\nThe *Yi* has yang’s steadfastness and yin’s steadfastness.\nZhu Hanshang said: *Qian* is steadfast in the eleventh month, *zi*, and moves left, governing six yang periods.\nYin is steadfast in the sixth month, *wei*, and moves right, governing six yin periods.\nYang’s steadfastness takes the yang hexagrams: *Qian* gives birth to the three sons—*Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*.\nYin’s steadfastness takes the yin hexagrams: *Kun* gives birth to the three daughters—*Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*.\n*Qian*’s first yang arises at *zi*, beginning at *Kan* and ending at *Li* as *Qian* concludes.\n*Kun*’s first yin arises at *wu*, but yin does not dare occupy the *wu* position, so it retreats one period to be steadfast at *wei* and ends at *Kan* as *Kun* concludes.\nYang moves left, governing six periods in alternation.\nYin moves right, likewise governing six periods in alternation.\nFollowing the completion of the year’s work, once the two steadfastnesses of yin and yang are established, one may then deduce the solar terms of the four seasons.\n\nIn my humble study of Kong’s commentary, numbers originate from yin and yang.\nYin and yang move to and fro along the sun’s path.\nAt the winter solstice, the sun reaches its southern extreme: yang advances as yin retreats.\nWinter is Water’s position. The first yang arises as Water, its number one.\nThus, *Qian* is steadfast in the eleventh month, *zi*, and moves left.\nAt the summer solstice, the sun reaches its northern extreme: yin advances as yang retreats.\nSummer is Fire’s position. It should take one yin as Fire’s number, but yin is not called an odd number, so it is paired.\nThus, in the sixth month, the second yin arises as Fire, its number two, and *Kun* is steadfast at *wei* and moves right.\nFrom the winter solstice to the summer solstice, yang advances.\nThus, the first month is established at *yin*. The third yang arises as Wood, its number three.\nFrom the summer solstice to the winter solstice, yin advances.\nThus, the eighth month is established at *you*. The fourth yin arises as Metal, its number four.\nThe third month is established at *chen*, occupying the first of the four seasons, as Earth’s position.\nThe fifth yang arises as Earth, its number five.\n\nWater lies in the north, following the qi of flourishing yin, so that which moistens and descends follows yin.\nFire lies in the south, following the qi of flourishing yang, so that which flames upward follows yang.\nWood in the east and Metal in the west are balanced between yin and yang: the soft can bend and straighten, the hard can be shaped and transformed.\nEarth contains and nourishes the myriad things, serving as the master of the Five Phases.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Jing Fang deduced many principles from divination.\nHis theory states: The *Great Expansion* is fifty, but one is not used, for Heaven’s generative qi, intending to empty and then fill, employs forty-nine.\nTen days, twelve branches, and twenty-eight constellations together make fifty.\nOne is not used; here, only the phrase “generative qi” is taken as the explanation.\nThe one is Heaven’s generative qi.\nIn my humble opinion: Heaven’s number does not use five, for one emerges from five.\nThe number of the *Great Expansion* does not use one, for one is Heaven’s spirit.\nWhen one enters the north, it transforms *Kun* into *Kan* and generates Water, its number one.\nWhen one enters the south, it transforms *Qian* into *Li* and generates Fire, its number two.\nWhen one enters the east, Heaven first joins Earth and generates Wood, forming *Zhen*, its number three.\nWhen one enters the west, yin delights in yang and generates Metal, forming *Dui*, its number four.\nIn the end, one returns and is stored in five, becoming the root of the myriad transformations.\nThe one that is preserved and not used is the generative qi.\nThis is the beginning of the *Tai Chu* qi.\n\nFifty-five retains five as the root of the Five Phases.\nThe *Great Expansion* of fifty retains one as the root of the Supreme Ultimate.\nFrom the Supreme Ultimate to the Five Phases, one divides into five, and five divides into ten.\nThe forty-nine are the detailed numbers of the Five Phases.\nFifty is five times ten.\nTen is two times five.\nTwo is one.\nOne is Water.\nThe beginning of the Five Phases, the emergence of generative qi.\nTen is Earth.\nThe end of the Five Phases, the return of generative qi.\n\nThus, the ten days, twelve branches, and twenty-eight constellations are dispersed in Heaven.\nThree hundred sixty are the degrees, dispersed on Earth.\nTen thousand one thousand five hundred twenty are the full numbers of the myriad things.\nThe one that is not used retreats into secrecy.\nThus, when Wood flourishes, Water retreats; when Fire flourishes, Wood retreats; when Earth flourishes, Fire retreats; when Metal flourishes, Earth retreats; when Water flourishes, Metal retreats.\nThese fifty-five, by retreating five and not using them, eliminate the surplus of the *Great Expansion*.\nFifty, by retreating one and not using it, empties the root number of the *Great Expansion*.\nThus it is said: Restrain its fullness and emptiness. The ten myriad things originate from five, and five originates from one. Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness ebb and flow with time.\nHeaven transforms one into four, and the four have form, but one has no form.\nThis one in humans is the heart; in virtue, it is benevolence; in the *Yi*, it is *Qian*; in time, it is spring.\nNowhere does it not serve as Heaven’s generative qi—how could the forty-nine stalks rely solely on this for their spirit?\nHeaven, Earth, and the myriad things all depend on this as the ground of their existence.\nThus it is said: The one that is not used is the ancestral root of all that is used.\n\nMaster Zhu said: There are the Five Phases of the Eight Trigrams—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—and the Five Phases of the Five Phases—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.\n\nThe *Qian* Metal is the Metal of the *Yi* trigrams. The *Dui* Metal is the Metal of the Five Phases. *Xun* Wood is taken as a symbolic representation within the trigrams, while *Zhen* Wood is the Wood of the eastern direction. Earth is lodged in the four seasons to reign, hence only the four seasons are spoken of. Master Kong of the Tang said: The Five Phases, excluding Earth, are also called the Four Symbols—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire. Earth governs *Zhen* Wood, *Li* Fire, *Dui* Metal, and *Kan* Water, each presiding over one season. Furthermore, *Xun* shares the same Wood as *Zhen*, *Qian* shares the same Metal as *Dui*, and with the addition of *Kun* Earth, they are also called the seven, eight, nine, and six. In individual things, they are Wood, Fire, Metal, Water; in humans, they are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom; in directions, they are east, west, south, north; in the *Yi*, they are *yuan*, *heng*, *li*, *zhen*; in symbols, they are dragon, tiger, quail, tortoise; in the moon, they are first quarter, full moon, last quarter, new moon; in the day, they are dawn, day, dusk, night; in the head, they are eyes, ears, nose, mouth; in the body, they are bones, flesh, blood, marrow. Principle has these four aspects, and *qi* also has these four aspects. In every affair and every thing, they cannot be separated. Spring, with *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*, is Lesser Yang; summer, with *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, is Greater Yang; autumn, with *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, is Lesser Yin; winter, with *you*, *xu*, and *hai*, is Greater Yin.\n\nShao Bowen said: Water, fire, earth, and stone are the fundamental substances, and the Five Phases reside within them. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are the manifestations of their function, from which the Five Materials emerge. Metal is extracted from stone, and Wood grows from earth. Only after stone exists does Metal come forth; only after earth exists does Wood arise. The Four Symbols and Four Bodies belong to the Prior Heaven. The Five Phases belong to the Posterior Heaven. He also said: The principles of the world are simply one giving rise to two. The *Yi* speaks in terms of eight and stops, while the *Hong Fan* speaks in terms of ten and stops. The trigrams are eight, but the numbers reach ten—eight is the number of yin and yang, while ten is the number of the Five Phases. One yin and one yang make two. Two multiplied by two makes four, and four multiplied by four makes eight. The Five Phases are fundamentally five, yet there are ten because one encompasses two. Wood encompasses *jia* and *yi*; Fire encompasses *bing* and *ding*; Earth encompasses *wu* and *ji*; Metal encompasses *geng* and *xin*; Water encompasses *ren* and *gui*. He also said: *Jia* and *yi* are two Woods, *bing* and *ding* are two Fires, *wu* and *ji* are two Earths, and Metal and Water are likewise. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them results in the mutual overcoming of yin-yang and the Five Phases, which is how they complete one another, and the virtues of the Five Constants are likewise. Nothing is greater than benevolence, the virtue of Wood. If benevolence errs by being too weak, it is cut by righteousness. Righteousness is the virtue of Metal. If righteousness errs by being too rigid, it is moderated by propriety. Propriety is the virtue of Fire. If propriety errs by being too restrictive, it is made flexible by wisdom. Wisdom is the virtue of Water. If wisdom errs by being too cunning, it is corrected by sincerity. The virtues of the Five Constants are the principle of the Five Phases overcoming one another. Old Su’s explanation is correct. Metal overcomes Wood, the hard triumphs over the soft. Water overcomes Fire, the soft triumphs over the hard.\n\nHe also said: There are those that mutually generate. Master Wang said: When Water is said to moisten, Fire is dry; when Earth is said to receive Wood, Metal’s restraint can be known. When Fire is said to flame, Water is cold, and Earth’s steaming, Wood’s warmth, and Metal’s clarity can be known. When Water is said to descend and Fire to ascend, Wood’s left, Metal’s right, and Earth’s center can be known. When Wood is said to be curved and straight, Earth’s roundness, Metal’s squareness, Fire’s sharpness, and Water’s levelness can be known. When Metal is said to be malleable and transformative, Wood’s change, Earth’s transformation, Water’s compliance, and Fire’s alteration can be known. When Earth is said to sow and reap, wells and ditches, cooking with Fire, implements of Wood and Metal can be known. What is meant by Wood’s change? It becomes bright as Fire and mottled as Earth. What is meant by Earth’s transformation? It can dry and moisten, spread and restrain. What is meant by Water’s compliance? It becomes sweet when sweet, bitter when bitter, green when green, white when white. What is meant by Fire’s alteration? It transforms the raw into the cooked, the soft into the hard, the hard into the soft. Metal can also transform—it can be round, level, sharp, curved, or straight. Yet without Fire’s alteration, it cannot transform itself, hence it is called malleable and transformative.\n\nHe also said: Those who obtain the essence of the Five Phases become humans—one speaks only of the Five Phases, not of yin and yang. To become human, one must have the Five Phases. The Five Phases are one yin and yang; apart from the Five Phases, there is no place to seek yin and yang. For example, *jia* Wood is yang, and *yi* Wood is yin. Master Zhu said: Numbers are merely the calculations of *qi*’s seasonal nodes; in general, they are simply one yin and yang. Dispersed, they become the Five Phases, and each of the Five Phases has its own yin and yang. *Jia* and *yi* are Wood, *bing* and *ding* are Fire; spring Wood and summer Fire, years, months, days, and hours—none are beyond the *qi* of the Five Phases. *Jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding* are also yin and yang, merely the *qi* of two and five. Humans are born when they encounter this *qi*, which varies unevenly, determining nobility or baseness, longevity or early death. When sages and worthies are above, their *qi* is harmonious. Otherwise, the *qi* is biased. Among the Five Phases, some obtain clear *qi*—they are intelligent but lack fortune and emolument. Some obtain turbid *qi*—they have fortune and emolument but lack wisdom. All is determined by their *qi* and fate. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Zhou, and the Duke of Shao obtained the correct *qi*; Confucius, Mencius, and the Qi and Lu schools obtained the biased *qi*. During the Five Dynasties, when chaos was extreme, many sages and worthies were born, as in the time of our ancestors. It was like waking from a deep sleep, refreshed and full of spirit.\n\nThe Five Phases have principle, *qi*, and number, and they operate within the ten celestial stems and twelve earthly branches. Their numbers can be calculated: Heaven One and Earth Six combine to generate and complete Water, residing in the north. *Zi* is number one, *hai* is number six; *ren* is yang Water, one, and *gui* is yin Water, six. Earth Two and Heaven Seven combine to generate and complete Fire, residing in the south. *Si* is number two, *wu* is number seven; *bing* is yang Fire, seven, and *ding* is yin Fire, two. Heaven Three and Earth Eight generate and complete Wood, residing in the east.\n\nYin is number three, *mao* is number eight; *jia* is yang Wood, three, and *yi* is yin Wood, eight.\n\nAs for Earth, its position is at the center, where Five and Ten combine to generate and complete Earth. *Wu* and the branches *chen* and *xu* align with Ten and belong to yang, while *ji* and the branches *chou*, *wei*, and *si* also align with Ten but belong to yin.\n\nIn the west, the Tiger’s position completes Metal: the stem *geng* and the branch *shen* are number nine and belong to yang, while the stem *xin* and the branch *you* are number four and belong to yin.\n\nIt is also said: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” The Dao cannot operate without number, and number cannot be established without the Dao. Arranged among the ten celestial stems, it is thus; distributed among the twelve earthly branches, it is also thus. Within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin; within the odd there is the even, and within the even there is the odd. Above, it enters the azure heavens; below, it enters the Yellow Springs. Vast, it contains the primordial *qi*; minute, it penetrates the boundless. None can escape this number.\n\nThe Six Classics speak of the Five Phases: the *Monthly Ordinances* records the numbers of mutual generation in the four seasons, while the *Yi and Shu* documents the numbers of mutual conquest in the Six Treasuries. As for the numbers of Heaven and Earth’s generation and completion, only the *Book of Changes* and the *Great Plan* discuss them. The legacy of Jichou and the lineage of Confucius both derived their teachings from the tradition of the River Chart and Luo Scripture.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Five, concludes.\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Six.\n\nCompiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai, collated by Fang Hui Wangu of Xugu, and proofread by Wanli\n\n*On Observing Images*\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"The Two Modes generate the Four Images.\" It further says: \"The Four Images are for demonstration.\" From Wang Fuxi to Cheng Yi, their explanations differ in many ways. Only Master Shao transmitted the learning of the Primordial Heaven, and at a single glance, its sequence could dispel a millennium of confusion. Master Zhu’s *Initiation into Learning* elucidates this most thoroughly, though some may not yet fully grasp it. I say: If you comprehend those eight characters within, then this entire scroll becomes but a fishing net and rabbit snare—what need is there for further words? Let those with insight inscribe this.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of the heavenly numbers as five and the earthly numbers as five. Retain one as the root and employ four for transformation. Applied to divination, these become the days of seven, eight, nine, and six. Applied to earth, they become water, fire, soil, and stone. Applied to observing celestial images, they become the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Within the hexagrams, they divide into eight. The difference lies merely in the specific referents.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Of all things, none are greater than Heaven and Earth. The vastness of Heaven is exhausted by yin and yang; the vastness of Earth is exhausted by hardness and softness. Yin and yang exhaust themselves to form the four seasons; hardness and softness exhaust themselves to form the four directions. Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. Heaven and Earth are but the greatest of things. Heaven is nothing more than the waxing and waning of one yin and one yang, the alternation of one cold and one heat to form the four seasons—this is the Dao of Heaven. Earth is nothing more than the interweaving of one hardness and one softness, the alternation of one level and one perilous terrain to form the four directions—this is the principle of Earth. Manifested in Heaven as the Four Images, arrayed in the year as the four seasons, shaped on Earth as the four bodies, and distributed in the directions as the four quarters, all are brought forth by the two things of Qian-yang and Kun-yin.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"The Four Images refer to yin, yang, hardness, and softness. Yin and yang generate Heaven; hardness and softness generate Earth.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Master Shao’s explanation of numbers also begins with one yin and one yang. He divides yin and yang into greater and lesser, forming the Four Images of Qian. He divides hardness and softness into greater and lesser, forming the Four Images of Earth. Yin intermingles with yang, and yang intermingles with yin, generating the Four Images of Heaven. The so-called Four Images are: Heaven possesses yin and yang, and within these, it further divides into Greater Yang, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, and Lesser Yin. The Four Images of Heaven are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Earth possesses hardness and softness, and within these, it further divides into Greater Hardness, Greater Softness, Lesser Hardness, and Lesser Softness. The Four Images of Earth are water, fire, soil, and stone. In truth, originally there was only one Supreme Ultimate. One divides into two, two into four, and four into eight. Heaven receives one set of four, and Earth receives one set of four. Each has one Supreme Ultimate operating within it, which is merely the doubling of the Five Phases.\"\n\nThe sun and moon constitute the *Changes*. The character *yi* (易) is composed of \"sun\" above as yang and \"moon\" below as yin. Thus, Zhuangzi said: \"The *Changes* is for guiding yin and yang.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Greater Yang is the sun; Greater Yin is the moon; Lesser Yang is the stars; Lesser Yin is the constellations. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations intermingle to exhaust the body of Heaven. Greater Softness is water; Greater Hardness is fire; Lesser Softness is soil; Lesser Hardness is stone. Water, fire, soil, and stone intermingle to exhaust the body of Earth.\"\n\nShao Botian said: \"*The Supreme Principle Governing the World* abandons metal, wood, water, fire, and soil, using instead water, fire, soil, and stone—why? The sun, moon, stars, and constellations are the Four Images of Heaven; water, fire, soil, and stone are the Four Bodies of Earth. Metal, wood, water, fire, and soil are called the Five Phases. The Four Images and Four Bodies belong to the Primordial Heaven; the Five Phases belong to the Manifested Heaven. The Primordial Heaven is that from which the Manifested Heaven emerges. Water, fire, soil, and stone are that from which the Five Phases emerge. Metal arises from stone; wood grows from soil. The Five Phases operate between Heaven and Earth, and within them lie water, fire, soil, and stone. *The Supreme Principle Governing the World* uses water, fire, soil, and stone to represent the fundamental body; the *Great Plan* uses water, fire, wood, metal, and soil to represent their application.\"\n\nThe sun is the essence of yang. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Qian represents the sun, and Qian’s position is due south. The moon is the essence of yin. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Dui represents the moon, and Dui’s position is southeast. Lesser Yang as stars belongs to Li, positioned due east. Lesser Yin as constellations belongs to Zhen, positioned northeast. Greater Softness as water resembles the moon. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Kun represents water, positioned due north. Greater Hardness as fire resembles the sun. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Gen represents fire, positioned northwest. Lesser Softness as soil resembles the constellations. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Kan represents soil, positioned due west. Lesser Hardness as stone resembles the stars. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Xun represents stone, positioned southwest.\n\nThe sun is yang; the moon is yin; the stars are hard; the constellations are soft—Heaven contains Earth. Water is yin; fire is yang; soil is soft; stone is hard—Earth contains Heaven. In Heaven, it forms images as the sun; on Earth, it forms shapes as fire. Fire and the sun are fundamentally one body, thus the yang-burning mirror obtains fire from the sun. In Heaven, it forms images as the moon; on Earth, it forms shapes as water. Water and the moon are fundamentally one body, thus the square vessel obtains water from the moon. In Heaven, it forms images as stars; on Earth, it forms shapes as stone. Stone and stars are fundamentally one body, thus tradition speaks of stars falling as stone. In Heaven, it forms images as constellations; on Earth, it forms shapes as soil. The constellations and soil are fundamentally one body, thus beyond the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, what is lofty and azure is all constellations. Beyond water, fire, soil, and stone, what is vast and boundless is all soil.\n\nNow, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are like a person’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. Water, fire, soil, and stone are like a person’s blood, qi, bones, and flesh. Thus, they are called the body of Heaven and Earth.\n\nYin and yang, hardness and softness—these are like a person’s spirit, the very source that gives rise to ears, eyes, mouth, nose, blood, qi, bones, and flesh.\n\nIt is further said: The sun brings heat; the moon brings cold. The stars bring day; the constellations bring night. When heat and cold, day and night intermingle, all the transformations of Heaven are complete. Water brings rain; fire brings wind; soil brings dew; stone brings thunder. When rain, wind, dew, and thunder intermingle, all the transformations of Earth are complete.\n\nHeat alters the nature of things; cold alters their dispositions; day alters their forms; night alters their bodies. When nature, disposition, form, and body intermingle, all the responses of the moving and the growing are complete. Rain transforms the creatures that run; wind transforms those that fly; dew transforms the grasses; thunder transforms the trees. When the running, flying, grasses, and trees intermingle, all the correspondences of the moving and the growing are complete.\n\nThe sun, moon, stars, and constellations transform through heat, cold, day, and night. Water, fire, soil, and stone transform through rain, wind, dew, and thunder. Heat, cold, day, and night are Heaven’s transformations, which initiate the response of Earth. Rain, wind, dew, and thunder are Earth’s transformations, which harmonize with Heaven. Only after this initiation and response do things come into being.\n\nHeat, cold, day, and night transform the nature, disposition, form, and body of things. Rain, wind, dew, and thunder transform the running, flying, grasses, and trees. Nature, disposition, form, and body originate from Heaven and are stimulated by Earth. The running, flying, grasses, and trees originate from Earth and respond to Heaven. Only after this stimulation and response are things brought to completion.\n\nThis initiation and response, this stimulation and response—such is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the myriad things.\n\nHeaven belongs to yang; Earth belongs to yin. Yang pertains to the moving; yin pertains to the growing. Within yang, the yang aspect soars upward in flight; within yin, the yang aspect runs downward. Heaven possesses the purest essence; Earth possesses the most refined essence. Among humans, the enlightened are the wise; among flying creatures, the phoenix and the luan; among running creatures, the qilin; among shelled creatures, the tortoise and the dragon; among grasses, the lingzhi and the orchid; among trees, the pine and the cypress; among stones, gold and jade.\n\nHeaven also possesses the most extreme violence; Earth also possesses the deepest obscurity. Among humans, the malevolent become omens; among flying creatures, the owl and the shrike; among running creatures, the tiger and the wolf; among shelled creatures, the venomous snake; among grasses, the poisonous herbs; among trees, the parasitic mistletoe; among stones, the harsh and the brittle.\n\nWhere there is number, there are things; when number is exhausted, things come to an end. Where there are things, there is number; when things come to an end, number is exhausted. Heaven and Earth give birth to things, each distinct and different, and thus their mutual stimulation and intermingling give rise to transformation.\n\nMaster Shao said: The sun begins with one; the moon begins with two; the year begins with three; the constellations begin with four. One is the primordial unity; two is the twelve celestial meetings; three is the three hundred sixty days; four is the four thousand three hundred twenty hours—this refers to a single year.\n\nIt is further said: The sun follows Heaven in its turning; the moon follows the sun in its movement; the stars appear following the moon. Thus, the stars follow the law of the moon; the moon follows the law of the sun; the sun follows the law of Heaven. Heaven is half bright and half dark; the sun is half full and half waning; the moon is half full and half deficient; the stars are half moving and half still—this is the principle of yin and yang.\n\nThough the sun moves to the right, it still turns left with Heaven. Though the moon moves swiftly, it meets the sun and conjoins with it, always remaining behind. The stars follow the moon because they appear at night.\n\nWhat is called the Dao consists of the alternation of yin and yang. Heaven follows the Dao, thus it is half bright and half dark. The sun follows Heaven, thus it is half full and half waning. The moon follows the sun, thus it is half full and half deficient. The stars follow the moon, thus they are half moving and half still.\n\nWhere there is one, there is also two; solitary yin or solitary yang cannot stand alone. The sun’s half-full, half-waning state means it is full when in the yang degrees and waning when in the yin degrees. The stars’ half-moving, half-still state means they move when among the wandering stars and are still when among the fixed stars.\n\nMaster Cai said: The sun is the regular celestial cycles; the moon determines the new and full moons; the stars are the fixed and wandering stars. The constellations are the twelve celestial divisions where the sun and moon conjoin.\n\nIt is further said: Heaven is constantly visible day and night. The sun appears by day, the moon by night, but each is half invisible. The stars are half visible at night—this is the hierarchy of nobility and baseness. Though Heaven is half dark and half bright, it is constantly visible day and night. The sun is in the sky during the day, while the moon is beneath the earth at night, thus it is half invisible. The stars are even less visible than the moon—this is the distinction of nobility and baseness. The superior encompasses the inferior; the great contains the small. The stars are half visible because the five planets and the twenty-eight lunar lodges appear in alternation.\n\nIt is further said: The moon can be seen by day, thus it is yin within yang. The stars can be seen by night, thus they are yang within yin. In the *Xiantian* system, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations correspond to Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen. The sun is yang within yang; the moon is yin within yang; the stars are yang within yin; the constellations are yin within yin. The moon can be seen by day, thus it is yin within yang. The stars can be seen by night, thus they are yang within yin. The stars also follow the moon, thus they are interwoven and mutually employed. The constellations are invisible, thus they are yin within yin. The constellations are Heaven, upon which the sun, moon, and stars are borne. Though the constellations are invisible, Heaven is visible day and night, thus the constellations are not used as one but are the foundation of what is used.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The Two Modes begin with one day to divide yin and yang and the Four Images. Next comes two days to divide the greater and lesser. The Two Modes are one line for yin and one line for yang. Adding one odd and one even line above each yields two lines. Four is called the Four Images, whose positions are: Greater Yang as one, Lesser Yin as two, Lesser Yang as three, Greater Yin as four. Their numbers are: Greater Yang as nine, Lesser Yin as eight, Lesser Yang as seven, Greater Yin as six. Thus, one, two, three, four contain nine, eight, seven, six.\n\nAccording to the *River Chart*, six is one added to five; seven is two added to five; eight is three added to five; nine is four added to five. According to the *Luo Writing*, nine is the remainder of one part in ten; eight is the remainder of two parts in ten; six is the remainder of four parts in ten.\n\nMaster Zhou Dunyi referred to them as Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. Master Shao Yong spoke of dividing two into four, where above the Four Images, each generates one odd and one even line. Thus, three lines yield eight, and with the Three Powers thus outlined, the eight trigrams emerge in name. Their positions are: Qian as one, Dui as two, Li as three, Zhen as four, Xun as five, Kan as six, Gen as seven, and Kun as eight.\n\nSome have questioned the Four Images in the *Book of Changes*. Kong Yingda of the Tang identified them as Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, while Zhuang of the Song saw them as the Image of Substance, the Image of Meaning, and the Image of Function. Those who speak of seven, eight, nine, and six do not directly equate them with yin and yang in their elder and younger forms. Master Zhang Zai said: the Dragon, Tiger, Quail, and Tortoise—Qian’s four virtues correspond to the four seasons. Zhu Zifa remarked: the four cardinal directions and four intercardinal points—none of the Confucians regarded these as the Four Images of Heaven. Yet the Master’s lines seem to differ from Master Zhu Xi’s sequence in drawing the trigrams.\n\nThis humble one says: Master Zhu Xi’s words are rooted in Master Shao Yong’s teachings on the Primordial Heaven, though earlier scholars did not elaborate on this. The Primordial Heaven encompasses all, for the Four Images are present everywhere. In the *Book of Changes*, they are seven, eight, nine, and six; in Heaven, they are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Elder yin transforms into younger yang, and elder yang transforms into younger yin. Younger yin and younger yang do not transform—they await the transformation of elder yin and elder yang. Tracing this back to antiquity, one may discern the omens of fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation, advance and retreat, preservation and demise.\n\nThe sun, as Greater Yang, undergoes the changes of cold and heat, day and night. The stars, as Lesser Yang, share the sun’s light but show no change in form. The moon, as Greater Yin, undergoes the changes of new moon, crescent, half-moon, and full moon. The constellations, as Lesser Yin, form the body of Heaven and show no change in shape. The celestial images in Heaven are the manifest line-images. The hexagrams and lines in the *Book of Changes* are the concealed celestial images. Fu Xi gazed upon the celestial images to draw the eight trigrams. The Master gazed upon the celestial patterns to understand the hidden and the manifest—all may be unified as one. Who would say that those who divine with the *Book of Changes* cannot divine the heavens? #1 Greater Yang.\n\nThe *Discourse on the Trigrams* states: \"Li represents the sun and fire.\"\n\nThe Tang scholar Kong [Yingda] said: The sun moves by taking the southern quarter. The accumulated heat of yang qi generates fire. The essence of fire qi becomes the sun. Fire has no form, yet when it attaches to things, it takes form. Born of earth, it rules as one of the two sovereigns in the south. Its spirit in Heaven is the sun, and on earth, it is fire.\n\nHu [Yuan] said: The sun’s body is Li, yin in structure yet yang in function. Being yin in structure, its movement is unhurried; being yang in function, it shines brightly by day. The *Canon of Yao* states: \"At the solstice, the day is longest; at the equinox, the night is shortest.\" This refers to the four cardinal days. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Its days are jia and yi; its days are bing and ding; its days are wu and ji; its days are geng and xin; its days are ren and gui.\" This refers to the days of the four seasons.\n\nThis fool says: When the sun is at *zi*, it rises at midnight. As it ascends, it turns toward life, and the world grows bright. When the sun is at *wu*, it begins to descend after noon. As it descends, it turns toward death, and all things become ghosts. The mechanism of ghosts and spirits lies solely in ascent and descent.\n\nThe *Yuanming Bao* states: The sun’s form is round, and when viewed from afar, it spans the heavens, corresponding to a thousand *li*. Thus, the royal domain mirrors it.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Heaven, earth, sun, and moon are one. The moon receives the sun’s light, yet the sun is not diminished. Nevertheless, the moon’s light is the sun’s light.\n\nMaster Shao said: Yang embracing yin becomes (the sun, yang within yang). Master Zhu said: \"Ceaseless activity\" describes the sun and moon, while \"the coming and going of cold and heat\" describes their function. Substance and function are inseparable; one cannot speak of them as prior or posterior.\n\nHeaven envelops earth externally. Earth’s form is small, while the sun’s light is vast, illuminating from all four sides. When the moon is in the center of the sky, it receives the sun’s light and becomes full. When the moon is far from the sun, its light waxes; when near, its light wanes.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: Heaven and earth interact through Kan and Li. Speaking of the sun, when the sun descends, the moon ascends; speaking of the moon, when the sun conjoins, the moon unites; speaking of the year, when cold comes, heat departs—all are instances of *jiji* (Completion). Kan above and Li below represent the extremes of water and fire. When they revert to their origins, within the extreme of *jiji* lies *weiji* (Incompletion).\n\nHan scholar Zhang Heng said: The sun is the ancestor of yang essence, accumulating to form the crow. It has three talons, for yang numbers are odd. The rooster belongs to *you*, yin within yang, and the central void of Li harbors fire qi. He also said: The moon is the center of yin essence, accumulating to form the hare. Yin numbers are even, and it belongs to *mao*. It is yang within yin, the fullness of Kan, where the water qi of Heavenly One resides.\n\nJin scholar Du Yu said: The sun’s substance is red, the moon’s substance is white. The *Yuanming Bao* states: The word for sun (*ri*) means \"fullness.\" It is the great brilliance, the fullness of light. The sun is the image of the ruler; when he travels through a land governed by the Dao, it shines brightly. When the sun displays five colors, his governance is at peace.\n\nMaster Shao said: In summer, the sun follows the Dipper northward; in winter, it follows the Dipper southward. At the summer solstice, heat reaches its extreme, and the sun thereafter follows the Dipper north. At the winter solstice, cold reaches its extreme, and the sun thereafter follows the Dipper south.\n\nThis fool once pondered Master Shao’s words, wondering if they accord with the teachings of the *Tai Xuan*. Let me set them forth in order. It says: When the sun moves slightly south, all things die; when the sun grows strong, all things live. At the summer solstice, the sun is in *Jing* (Well); the sun reaches the southern limit, and the host of yin gradually grows, so all things turn toward death. After the winter solstice, the sun is in *Qianniu* (Oxherd); it returns to the northern path, and the host of yang gradually grows, so all things turn toward life.\n\nThe *Xuan* also says: When the Dipper moves slightly north, all things are empty; when the Dipper moves slightly south, all things are full. After the Beginning of Winter, the Dipper’s handle points to *hai*, and yin qi conceals things, so the day is empty. At the Beginning of Summer, it points to *si*, and yang qi brings forth things, so the day is full.\n\nIt further says: When the sun moves south, it travels leftward yet rotates rightward. When the Dipper moves south, it travels rightward yet rotates leftward. The sun moves rightward against the heavens. In spring, it begins its journey, passing through the seven stars from the west to the south, hence it is said to travel rightward. In autumn, it returns, passing through the seven stars from the east to the north, hence it is said to rotate leftward. The Dipper follows the heavens leftward. In spring, it points east, passing through three celestial markers to the south, beginning from the east, hence it is said to travel leftward. In autumn, it points west, passing through two celestial markers to the north, returning from the west, hence it is said to rotate rightward.\n\nIt further says: The winter solstice and the time after midnight are images of approaching the Mystery. At the winter solstice, the Dipper points to *zi*; at midnight, it aligns with *zi*, signifying progression without reaching the extreme, advance without arrival, emptiness without fullness. At this time, the celestial Dao moves leftward, and the Dipper’s handle follows the heavens leftward. Though the sun moves rightward against the heavens, whenever it meets the moon, it aligns with the Dipper’s handle. The *Xuan* hexagrams, from *Zhong* (Center) to *Ying* (Response), number forty-one, with the odd as primary. In one hundred eighty-two and a half days, the sun moves through them—this is yang moving within yang. Moving through yang degrees, it waxes until *si*, completing *Qian* and giving birth to things.\n\nThe summer solstice and the time after noon are images of receding from the Mystery. At the summer solstice, the Dipper points to *wu*; at noon, it aligns with *wu*, signifying progression to the extreme and then retreat, advance to the limit and then return, fullness and then diminution. At this time, the celestial Dao turns rightward, and the Dipper’s handle also follows the heavens rightward. Though the sun moves leftward against the heavens, whenever it meets the moon, it aligns with the Dipper’s rightward pointing. The *Xuan* hexagrams, from *Ying* (Welcome) to *Yang* (Nourishment), number forty, with yin and even numbers in operation. In one hundred eighty-two days, this is yin moving within yin. The sun moves through yin degrees, waning until *hai*, completing *Kun* and storing away all things.\n\nSouth and north are the fixed positions of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the warp. East and west are the flowing qi of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the weft. In Heaven, the sun divides day and night in a single day, and south and north in a single year; for the myriad things, it divides life and death. #2\n\nThus it is said: when yang arrives, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. The annotation states: the preceding text accounts for three hundred sixty-four and a half days, and adding the two *zàn* of *qíshū* completes one day, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-three parts. The twenty parts within a single day yield three seasons, forming three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter degrees.\n\nAs the *Han shang* records: Liu Zhao states that the sun’s passage through the northern *lu* is winter, the western *lu* is spring, the southern *lu* is summer, and the eastern *lu* is autumn. Common discourse rightly accepts the southern and northern *lu*, but regarding the eastern and western *lu*, it is either mistaken or doubtful. The *Sui Treatise* states that the eastern *lu* is spring and the western *lu* is autumn. This requires further examination and cannot be conflated.\n\nFor south and north serve as the warp, with *zǐ* and *wǔ* in opposition. At winter solstice, the first yang arises at *zǐ*, where the numinous and the reasoned unite heaven and earth to initiate the year’s transformations. The sun, moon, stars, and Dipper all begin here. Thus it is said: traversing the northern *lu* is winter; traversing the southern *lu* is summer. Direction and season cannot be altered.\n\nFrom this, heaven turns from north to east, rotating leftward to generate all things. The sun, however, moves from north to west, turning rightward to serve as the weft. In early spring, the sun resides in *Yingshi*, a northern constellation—this is the first month, *jiàn yín*, meeting at *Kèzī*’s *hài*. In mid-spring, the sun is in *Kui*, a western constellation—second month, *jiàn mǎo*, meeting at *Jiànglóu*’s *xū*. In late spring, the sun is in *Wèi*—third month, *jiàn chén*, meeting at *Dàliáng*’s *yǒu*. Weaving west to east, it is thus said: the sun’s passage through the western *lu* is called spring.\n\nBy the fourth month, *sì* aligns with *shēn*, meeting at *Shíshěn*. The sun traverses the southern *lu*, and at *wǔ*, the first yin arises, as creation gathers its work and restrains the myriad things. Here, the Way of Heaven turns from south to north, rotating rightward from the west to complete all things. The sun then moves from south to east, traveling leftward to serve as the weft. In early autumn, the sun is in *Yì*, where *shēn* aligns with *sì*, called *Chúnwěi*. In mid-autumn, the sun is in *Jiǎo*, where *yǒu* aligns with *chén*, called *Shòuxīng*. In late autumn, the sun is in *Fáng*, where *xū* aligns with *mǎo*, called *Dàhuǒ*. Weaving east to west, it is thus said: the sun’s passage through the eastern *lu* is called autumn.\n\nThe reason spring is not called the eastern *lu* and autumn not the western *lu* is to show that the warp of south and north cannot change, while the weft of east and west mutually complement one another.\n\nThe sun is yang, and when yang governs, it rises from east to midnight, advancing southward. As the sun progresses northward, daylight lengthens, and yang’s advance brings warmth and heat. When yin governs, it rises from summer solstice to noon, advancing northward. As the sun retreats southward, daylight shortens, and yin’s dominance brings cold and coolness. Between the two solstices, the Way is balanced and shadows align—here lie the spring and autumn equinoxes.\n\nThe sun has its central path, while the moon has its nine courses. At new moon, the *lu*’s passage nears its node, and deficiency arises, giving rise to cold and warmth. At winter solstice, the sun reaches its southern extreme, and the shadow lengthens; if it does not reach its extreme, warmth becomes harmful. At summer solstice, the sun reaches its northern extreme, and the shadow shortens; if it does not reach its extreme, cold becomes harmful.\n\nShao Yong said: Heaven’s movement creates day and night; the sun’s movement creates cold and heat. Summer is shallow, winter is deep—this is the union of heaven and earth. Leftward rotation and rightward movement are the union of heaven and sun. Heaven completes one revolution in a day. The sun moves one degree, carried by heaven’s turning, following it. In summer, it rises at *yín* and sets at *xū*; in winter, it rises at *chén* and sets at *shēn*; in spring and autumn, it rises at *mǎo* and sets at *yǒu*. Rising marks day, setting marks night—though dependent on the sun’s rising and setting, its movement is governed by heaven.\n\nWhen the sun is beneath the earth, it is cold; when it is above, it is hot. Traversing the northern *lu* in winter brings cold, as the sun travels deep beneath the earth. Traversing the southern *lu* in summer brings heat, as the sun travels shallow beneath the earth. Traversing the western *lu* in spring and the eastern *lu* in autumn brings the mean of cold and heat.\n\nThe sun’s movement creates cold and heat. As the Way of Heaven turns south, it moves from deep to shallow; as it turns north, it moves from shallow to deep—this is the union of heaven and earth. Some say: in summer, the southern pole is upright; in winter, the southern pole is inclined, likening it to a person’s head to explain the shallow and deep—this fails to account for the sun’s ecliptic.\n\nAt summer solstice, the sun is at *wǔ* and aligns with *wǔ*; at winter solstice, the sun is at *zǐ* and aligns with *zǐ*, following heaven’s movement. Thus, depth and shallowness mark the union of heaven and earth. At winter solstice, the sun rises, and *Xīngjì* moves rightward as the sun shifts one degree. Heaven rotates leftward one revolution and passes ten degrees, while the sun traverses the six *jiǎ* and meets the Dipper—this is the union of heaven and sun.\n\nThe night of winter solstice is like the day of summer solstice; the night of summer solstice is like the day of winter solstice. Winter’s night is only like the day of spring and autumn, as daylight encroaches upon night by five *kè*. The sun rises at its usual time, yet dawn appears two and a half *kè* before its rising, and dusk lingers two and a half *kè* after its setting.\n\nIt is also said: rising in the east and setting in the west follows heaven’s movement. Summer in the north and winter in the south follow heaven’s union. Heaven completes one revolution, surpassing one star, corresponding to the sun’s movement. Spring aligns with *yǒu*, summer with *wǔ*, autumn with *mǎo*, and winter with *zǐ*, corresponding to the sun’s union.\n\nAt winter solstice midnight, *zǐ*, the sun rises at *Xīngjì*. The sun moves rightward one degree, and heaven shifts leftward one degree, so the sun remains at midnight. Thus, it rises in the east and sets in the west—this is heaven’s movement, not the sun’s.\n\nIn summer, the sun’s path follows the northernmost point; in winter, it follows the southernmost. When the sun is farthest north, it is closest to the pole, so shadows are short and days are long. When the sun is farthest south, it is farthest from the pole, so shadows are long and days are short. This follows heaven’s union.\n\nThe sun moves one degree each day, and heaven completes one revolution, surpassing one degree.\n\nEach \"degree\" refers to a degree of the stars, thus corresponding to the sun’s movement. At winter solstice, the sun is at *zǐ*; at summer solstice, at *wǔ*; at spring equinox, at *yǒu*; and at autumn equinox, at *mǎo*—this is heaven’s shifting. At winter solstice midnight, the sun aligns with *zǐ*; at summer solstice noon, it aligns with *wǔ*; at the spring and autumn equinoxes, it aligns either with *yǒu* or *mǎo*. East and west alternate in their weft, forming the intersection of yin and yang in spring and summer—this corresponds to the sun’s union.\n\nI have examined ancient records: at winter solstice, the sun is at the first degree of *Qiānniú*; at spring equinox, at the fourth degree of *Lóu*; at summer solstice, at the twenty-first degree of *Dōngjǐng*; and at autumn equinox, at the tenth degree of *Jiǎo*. The *Suí Treatise* states: when the sun is closest to the pole, shadows are short and days are long—this describes the summer solstice. When the sun follows the inner path and is nearest the pole, daylight is at its longest. An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of one foot and five inches. At spring equinox in *Lóu* and autumn equinox in *Jiǎo*, day and night are equal. Thus, an eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of seven feet and five inches. The *Suí Treatise* further states: when the sun is farthest from the pole, shadows are long and days are short—this describes the winter solstice. When the sun follows the outer path and is farthest from the pole, daylight is at its shortest. An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of thirteen feet. Subtracting one foot and five inches leaves a remaining shadow of eleven feet and five inches—this is the shadow’s variation between winter and summer. Hence it is said: the sun has a central path. North to *Qiānniú*, closest to the pole, marks the summer solstice. South to *Qiānniú*, farthest from the pole, marks the winter solstice. *Jiǎo* in the east and *Lóu* in the west lie at a median distance from the pole. Thus, south to *Jiǎo* and east to *Lóu* mark the spring and autumn equinoxes.\n\nMaster Zhèng says: at spring equinox, the sun is in *Lóu*, the moon’s first quarter appears at *Dōngjǐng*, its full phase at *Jiǎo*, and its last quarter at *Qiānniú*. At autumn equinox, the sun is in *Jiǎo*, the moon’s first quarter appears at *Qiānniú*, its full phase at *Lóu*, and its last quarter at *Dōngjǐng*. This also determines whether the qi has arrived by observing the shadows. When the qi of spring, autumn, winter, and summer all arrive, the four seasons proceed in proper order. The solstices mark the sun’s true position. Thus, at the extremes of length and shortness, governance reaches its peak and the qi arrives. Winter has no excess yang, summer no hidden yin. At the solstices, when the midday shadow matches the expected measure, the year will be prosperous and the people harmonious. If it does not match, the year will be harsh and the people deceitful. When the ruler’s governance and teachings are proper, the four seasons’ shadows follow the expected measure.\n\nIf the shadow advances, there will be floods—meaning the shadow is longer than expected. When the sun’s path lies outside the ecliptic, the shadow lengthens. A long shadow indicates yin’s dominance, hence floods. If the shadow retreats, there will be drought—meaning the shadow is shorter than expected. When the sun’s path enters within the ecliptic, the shadow shortens. A short shadow indicates yang’s dominance, hence drought. An advance of one foot and two inches in the shadow foretells a lunar eclipse, for the moon’s number is twelve. A retreat of one foot and two inches foretells a solar eclipse, for the sun’s number is ten. Shadow advance is surplus; shadow retreat is deficiency—this also determines whether the qi has arrived by observing the shadows.\n\nIt is further said: when the sage observes the movements of the sun and moon and pairs them with *kǎn* and *lí*, the meaning of the Eight Trigrams becomes manifest. The *Appended Judgments* states: \"Displaying images and revealing brightness, nothing is greater than the sun and moon.\" Master Zhū says: as in the *nà jiǎ* method, *kǎn* corresponds to *wù*, *lí* to *jǐ*. One line of *qián* belongs to *wù*, one line of *kūn* to *jǐ*. Only when *wù* remains with *jǐ* do *kǎn* and *lí* form. For *qián* and *kūn* are the great parents, while *kǎn* and *lí* are the lesser parents.\n\nHànshàng says: Yú observed the sun and moon suspended in heaven to form the images of the Eight Trigrams. At dusk and dawn, the *kǎn* image appears, water flowing to *wù*. At noon, the *lí* image appears, fire conjoining *jǐ* to complete *wù*. The position of *jǐ* earth is the central image, manifest in the midst of sun and moon mutually hastening to generate brightness. When the second and fifth lines of *qián* and *kūn* intersect, *kǎn* and *lí* are born, and the sun and moon emerge. On the third day, the *zhèn* image appears, the moon emerging at *gēng*. On the eighth day, the *duì* image appears, the moon visible at *dīng*. On the fifteenth day, the *qián* image appears, the moon full at *jiǎ* and *rén*. On the sixteenth day, the *xùn* image appears, the moon waning at *xīn*. On the twenty-third day, the *gèn* image appears, the moon diminishing at *bǐng*. On the thirtieth day, the *kūn* image appears, the moon extinguished at *yǐ*. Taken together, *kǎn* and *lí* are the sun and moon, generating brightness at *zhèn*, generating darkness at *xùn*, waxing at *duì*, waning at *gèn*, full at *qián*, and extinguished at *kūn*. The ten days from *jiǎ* to *guǐ* are contained within the Eight Trigrams.\n\nThe *Records* state: \"Great brightness is born in the east, the moon is born in the west.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"The sun of the east, the moon of the east.\" The moon’s beginning is born in the west, its fullness in the east. The sun’s rising place is in the east. Before dawn, it has already traveled beneath the earth, merely not yet emerged above it. The ancients explained the character for \"sun\" as *shí* (real), and for \"moon\" as *quē* (deficient). The sun is always thus real. Heaven’s movement has discrepancies, and the sun, moon, and stars are slower, unable to keep pace. Only the sun’s movement is fixed and unchanging, hence it is called *shí* (real).\n\nIt is further said: heaven and earth’s great awakening lies in summer, while human spirit resides in the union of the heart. At noon, the sun follows heaven to the south; at midnight, it follows heaven to the north—this is the awakening and sleeping of a single day. In summer, the sun aligns with noon; in winter, it aligns with midnight—this is the awakening and sleeping of a year. Thus, in summer, the vast sky is *lí*, the trigram of all things meeting. The sun is heaven’s spirit. Human spirit: by day, it resides in the heart—this is summer; by night, in the kidneys—this is winter. Day corresponds to night, the hidden storehouse. The *Mysterious* states: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss, and the spirit will not stray.\" This means dwelling the heart in the qi’s viscera to preserve the spirit. Heaven and earth’s union is three-tenths. At summer solstice’s day, the sun is seven-tenths above heaven; at winter solstice’s night, it is seven-tenths below the earth.\n\nFrom the perspective of heaven, seven-tenths of the sun lies above the earth, while three-tenths lies below—thus the yang number reaches its fullness at seven. The sun’s path differs from heaven’s because it follows northern and southern courses.\n\nIt is also said: when the sun enters the earth, it forms the image of conjoined essence. A single night is like a year’s winter. Heaven’s spirit and earth’s numen—yang *hun* and yin *po*—at midnight of the winter solstice, from the first half of *zi* to the latter half of *zi*, meet and unite in the Palace of the Yellow Springs. This is how the primordial origin is gestated and the myriad things sprout. Thus it is said: man and woman unite their essence and qi to give birth to humans; the sun, through its yang essence, joins with earth’s qi to give birth to creatures. Know this, and you know the study of nature and destiny.\n\nIt is further said: the sun is heaven’s yang *hun*. Yang embraces yin to form the sun, using *hun* to govern *po*. Yin embraces yang to form the moon, using *po* to restrain *hun*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: the sun and moon emerge from water before ascending to heaven; when they set in the west, they enter water again. Someone once asked Master Zhu about the Hun Tian theory, saying: \"Beyond heaven is water, which floats heaven and bears the earth.\" He replied: \"There is no water beyond heaven; below the earth is water that bears it.\" Mencius said: \"Water flows through the earth.\" Su Shi said: \"There is nowhere beneath the earth that is not water.\" Know this, and you will understand that beneath the earth lies water, while beyond heaven is qi—this is clear.\n\nYang metal is the mother of water, and water is the mother of the myriad things. Heaven is but a single, purely firm and luminous qi. The earth lies level within it.\n\nEach night, the sun of heaven circles once beneath the earth, passing through one degree. The qi of Heavenly One generates water, which benefits the myriad things. The sun, as the essence of yang, can also dry the water beneath the earth, preventing it from harming the myriad things. How could mere \"soaking of scorched tails\" ever drain it? The spirit of Heavenly One is the mother of qi. When clouds arise, waters surge, and mists swirl, the ceaseless revolution of day and night causes water droplets to flow forth. If water were to swell unchecked by the sun’s drying power, mountains would burst, and timely rains would descend upon heaven and earth. Yin and yang naturally contain abundant qi. When excessive, it pours down in torrents, drowning the people below in darkness and deluge.\n\nHistorical records speak of ten suns appearing in the time of Yao, though this is hardly credible. Yet heaven’s compassion for the people below is a valid principle. The sun, though fiery, regularly brightens the world, advancing and retreating in due measure. As the *Yi* says: \"Brightness enters the earth and turns.\" Heaven abides in water, as in the hexagram *Xu*. The sun is yang, and water is yin; yin qi disperses without fail, and water qi dissipates without exception. When the sun emerges, it becomes day within the cosmos—this is the true course of heaven’s movement. Such is the intent of creation to uphold yang.\n\nThus, the celestial body is perfectly round, encircling the heavens like an inner enclosure. The moon, being water, waxes and wanes, for it is said that Heavenly One generates water. Each day, the sun ascends in heaven while simultaneously circling beneath the earth, as evidenced by the tides. In the hexagram *Ming Yi*, the sun enters beneath the earth, becoming night. How could there be a single day without the image of yang brightness?\n\nThe *Sui Dynasty’s Treatise on Astronomy* states: \"The sun dries water to its utmost.\" It also says: \"Heaven has two paths: the yellow and the red.\" Shen Cunzhong remarked: \"Astronomers speak of ten colors to record the movements of the sun and moon.\" The celestial body is perfectly round, like two lids joined together. The celestial equator lies horizontally at their juncture. North of the equator, it resembles an inverted lid; south of it, like an outer enclosure or an upturned lid. Both use the center of the diagram as their pole. North of the celestial equator lies the North Pole; south of it, the South Pole.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The ecliptic is where the two halves of the celestial sphere join, at the center of heaven.\" He also said: \"The celestial equator lies precisely at heaven’s center, like the seam of a joined box. The ecliptic crosses transversely through the celestial equator.\" Further, he stated: \"Half of the celestial equator lies within the ecliptic, and half outside. At two points east and west, they intersect, dividing the heavens into degrees. When they meet, it is at the crossroads of the ecliptic and celestial equator.\" At the full moon, the moon and sun face each other directly, as if one were at *zi* and the other at *wu*, sharing the same degree. For instance, if the moon is at *Bi* 11°, the sun is also at that degree, though they face north and south. The reason the sun is eclipsed at the new moon is that the moon is always below, and the sun above. When they meet, the moon obscures the sun from below. Thus, it is said: \"At the full moon, the moon is eclipsed, for yin dares to contend with yang.\"\n\nThe sun has a central path, called the ecliptic. Some say: \"The central earth of *wu* and *ji* corresponds to the stars, and the four seasons have four movements: spring west, autumn east, summer north, winter south—different from the sun’s path of spring east, autumn west, summer south, and winter north. During the four seasonal months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, all belong to earth, which is the true path of the ecliptic. At these times, the stars also belong to the ecliptic. When they return to their proper positions, the sun always follows the ecliptic.\"\n\nZheng’s commentary on the *Hong Fan* asks: \"What does it mean for the four seasons to align with the ecliptic?\" I say: \"Between winter and spring, spring and summer, autumn and winter—these are the four seasonal months belonging to earth. Each season lends its power for eighteen days, totaling seventy-two days, ending between fire and metal. Their position is *kun*, in terms of time. The ecliptic lies at the center, also called the central path. Divided into four—green, red, white, and black—it becomes eight, plus one, making nine months, assisting the sun in generating and completing the myriad things.\"\n\nThus, the *Treatise on Astronomy* says: \"The path the sun follows is called the ecliptic.\" The moon has nine paths: two black paths emerge north of the ecliptic; two red paths emerge south of it; two white paths emerge west of it; and two green paths emerge east of it. Together with the ecliptic, they make nine. At the *Li Chun* and *Chun Fen*, the moon travels east along the green path; at *Li Qiu* and *Qiu Fen*, it travels west along the white path; at *Li Dong* and *Dong Zhi*, it travels north along the black path; at *Li Xia* and *Xia Zhi*, it travels south along the red path. Yellow is the true color. It is also said: \"Green and red emerge from the yang path; white and black emerge from the yin path.\" If the moon deviates from its proper course, traveling the yang path brings drought and wind, while traveling the yin path brings rain and water. Traveling the ecliptic is correct.\n\nThus, the *Xing Bei* says: \"When a wise ruler is on the throne, the sun, moon, and five planets all follow the ecliptic.\" Though the moon’s paths—white, black, red, and green—differ, they never stray beyond the east, west, south, and north of the ecliptic. The sun travels the center of the ecliptic, with its inner part to the north, from *Kui* to *Jiao*, *hai* to *si*. The outer part is to the south, from *Jiao* and *Kang* to *Shi* and *Bi*, *chen* to *xu*. In the east, between *Jiao*, lies the Gate of Heaven; *Fang* is the Celestial Street. The ecliptic passes through it, where the seven luminaries travel.\n\nShaozi said: \"The mutual eclipses of the sun and moon are the intersections of their cycles. When the sun faces the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed—like water and fire overcoming each other. Thus, the noble employ wisdom, while the petty rely on force.\" When the sun and moon face each other, it is called the full moon; when they meet, it is called the new moon.\n\nThe solar eclipse occurs at the new moon, when the moon is near the sun and devoid of light, becoming the dark moon. Thus, when petty men draw close in familiarity, they often endanger their lord. The lunar eclipse occurs at the full moon, when the moon opposes the sun and is at its brightest—like petty men abroad, though powerful, ever in peril. Water overcoming water is direct concealment and conquest, the petty employing force. Fire overcoming water is separation by an intervening object, the noble employing wisdom.\n\nThe sun and moon meet twelve times in a year. When their twelve full-moon nodes intersect, an eclipse occurs; if they do not intersect, there is no eclipse. Thus, while the sun travels the ecliptic, the moon travels the nine paths, and there are times when they intersect yet no eclipse occurs. At the new moon, the sun and moon occupy the same degree. At the full moon, they are at their farthest and in opposition. At the first and last quarters, the sun and moon are near one and far three—such as when the sun is at *wu* and the moon at *mao* or *you*. At the new moon, though the sun and moon are in the same degree east and west, if the moon’s path lies far to the south or north of the sun’s, there is no eclipse. Even if they are close in the south or north, if the sun is on the inner path and the moon on the outer, there is no eclipse.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Eclipses of the sun and moon are not their regular course, yet lunar eclipses are considered ordinary. Solar eclipses are deemed inauspicious because yin overcomes yang and obscures it—an intolerable reversal. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records every solar eclipse but makes no note of lunar eclipses, for this very reason.\" The sun and moon meet twelve times in a year; when they meet, the moon’s light is entirely extinguished, becoming the dark moon. After the meeting, the moon’s light revives, becoming the new moon. Fifteen days before and after the new moon, the sun and moon are in opposition. When the moon’s light is full at the full moon, and the sun and moon are in opposition, occupying the same degree and path, the sun overpowers the moon, and the moon is eclipsed. At the dark and new moons, when the sun and moon conjoin, sharing the same degree east-west and the same path north-south, the moon obscures the sun, and the sun is eclipsed. These follow regular patterns.\n\nYet when the ruler cultivates virtue, employs the worthy, and removes the wicked, yang flourishes and yin cannot encroach, so the moon constantly avoids the sun. Though their paths may be irregular, eclipses that should occur do not. Otherwise, if virtuous governance is neglected, ministers betray their lord, petty men encroach upon the noble, and barbarians disrupt the central kingdom—yin flourishes while yang wanes, and eclipses that should not occur do, marking extraordinary omens.\n\nMaster Guliang records four kinds of solar eclipses: one where the sun is eclipsed at dusk, as in the third year of Duke Yin; one where the eclipse is total at the new moon, as the next day in the seventeenth year of Duke Xiang; one where the eclipse is total, as in the third year of Duke Xiang; and one where the eclipse occurs at night, as in the eighteenth year of Duke Zhuang. A day and night together make one day; if the sun is not eclipsed by day but is by night, the sun is below the earth, and its form is unseen. By the new moon, when the sun first appears, if its light is diminished, it is known that a nighttime eclipse occurred. Nighttime eclipses belong to the dark moon of the previous month. During a nighttime eclipse, the stars lose their light.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: \"In the meeting of the tenth month.\" Master Zhu adopted Kong’s commentary in great detail, and I now excerpt it here: \"On the new moon of *xinmao*, the sun was eclipsed.\" Ancient calendars and the *Zhou Bi* both state that the celestial sphere measures 365¼ degrees, with the sun and moon both moving rightward across the heavens. The sun travels one degree per day, while the moon travels 13⁷⁄₁₉ degrees per day. Thus, the sun is slow and the moon swift, and after slightly more than twenty-nine days, the moon completes a circuit, overtakes the sun, and meets it—this is called a node. Each month they meet, but the moon may be outside or inside the sun’s path, so eclipses do not always occur; they only happen when they meet. Moreover, the moon and sun must share the same path for an eclipse to occur—this was in the tenth month of the Zhou and the eighth month of the Xia.\n\nWhen the sun and moon meet and a solar eclipse occurs, it is a sign of yin encroaching upon yang, a minister encroaching upon the ruler. That it is called a solar eclipse is because the moon eclipses it. He Xiu said: \"It does not say the moon eclipses it because its form cannot be seen.\" Thus, it is ambiguously called \"the sun was eclipsed.\" From *jia* to *gui* are the days; *jia* is firm and *yi* is yielding, with five firm and five yielding among them, the ten days all being stems, thus the sun is the ruler. From *zi* to *hai* are the ministers; *zi* is yang and *chou* is yin, with six yang and six yin among them, the twelve days all being branches, thus the hours are ministers. *Mao* corresponds to ministers, *xin* to the ruler, metal should overcome wood. Now ministers reverse and encroach upon the ruler—this is the five phases acting in opposition. With *xin* as king in autumn, ministers should rest and withdraw, yet they encroach upon the young ruler who should reign.\n\nThe celestial degrees of ancient and modern times are the same. Solar and lunar eclipses have no fixed time. Calendar makers calculate the nodes of the sun and moon’s meetings, generally setting a limit of slightly more than 173 days. The sun and moon each have their own paths across the heavens. Even when they meet at the new moon, their paths may be outer or inner. If the moon is first on the inner path, eclipses occur more frequently within the limit; if the moon is first on the outer path, eclipses occur less frequently even within the limit. Du Yu, observing these irregularities, said: \"Though the sun and moon are moving bodies with measurable paths, they cannot avoid slight excesses and deficiencies. Thus, even when they meet, there may be no eclipse.\" Only on the day of the summer solstice do the noble take heed.\n\nYet eclipses have no fixed time; they may occur even in months other than the solstices and equinoxes. It is merely that at the two equinoxes, day and night are equal, resembling shared paths, while at the two solstices, length and shortness are at their extremes. If they coincide, it is named to convey meaning, not because it is necessarily so. In truth, all solar eclipses are anomalies. If the ruler reforms his faults and cultivates goodness, even in the month of the summer solstice, disaster can be averted. If he persists in evil and wrongdoing, even in the months of the solstices and equinoxes, misfortune will follow. How can the two solstices and two equinoxes alone be free from calamity?\n\nWhen the radiant and great luminous Dao/Way shines upon the earth below, should it suddenly dim and vanish, turning day into night, nothing could be more monstrous or strange. Thus, there are established rites of drumming, offering silk, demoting the victorious, and removing music—all to emphasize celestial omens and warn the ruler. Yet the Way of Heaven is profound and distant, and its verifications may come only in time. Or perhaps human misfortune and transgression merely coincide with them. Therefore, the sage seizes upon these changes, often invoking the numinous to serve as admonitions. This allows the wise and discerning to grasp the profound intent of the ancient sages, while those of middling or lesser capacity may believe in omens and portents, thus fostering self-restraint.\n\nYet the numinous may aid teaching but cannot itself be the teaching. To rely solely on the numinous is to delude the masses; to discard it entirely is to harm what is fitting. Thus, its words seem both present and absent, its affairs both credible and doubtful—all to achieve a grand harmony.\n\nDu Yu said: \"The sun’s light, at the time of full moon, obscures the moon’s light, hence a lunar eclipse. When the sun and moon meet, the moon obscures the sun, hence a solar eclipse.\"\n\nSu Shi said: \"Confucius, in compiling the *Spring and Autumn Annals* over 242 years, recorded every celestial anomaly involving the sun and stars, yet never noted lunar eclipses. Commentators explain: the moon represents the way of the feudal lords and the image of the barbarians. When it wanes, it signifies the ruler of the Central Kingdom prevailing. Thus, it is not considered a disaster.\"\n\nThe diviner of Chuqiu in the *Zuozhuan* said: \"The sun has ten divisions, corresponding to ten times and ten ranks. Noon corresponds to the king, the meal hour to the duke, dawn to the minister, cockcrow to the officer, midnight to the commoner, the time of settling to the charioteer, dusk to the servant, sunset to the subordinate, the afternoon to the attendant, and the time of dim light to the menial. The time of the corner sun at sunrise is omitted out of respect for the king and duke.\"\n\nDu Yu of Jin said: \"The time when the sun is at its zenith corresponds to the king; the meal hour to the duke; dawn to the minister; cockcrow to the officer; midnight to the commoner; the time of settling to the charioteer; dusk to the servant; sunset to the subordinate; the afternoon to the attendant; and the time of dim light to the menial. The corner sun at sunrise (mao) and the time of the hidden sun (si) are omitted—both times of sunrise (mao) and emergence (si)—out of reverence for the king and duke.\" This is akin to the five hexagrams of a month, where the first corresponds to the feudal lord, the second to the grandee, the third to the minister, the fourth to the duke, and the fifth to the ruler.\n\nThis fool says: *The Book of Changes* is a work that exalts the yang and suppresses the yin. The sun is the image of the ruler, thus it is revered and exalted. The Upper Canon concludes with thirty hexagrams, ending in *Li* (Fire). *Li* in the heavens is the sun, so all living beings look up to its light. The Lower Canon concludes with thirty-four hexagrams, ending in *Ji Ji* (After Completion), with *Li* present throughout. Without it, the people cannot live, for it sustains their daily needs.\n\n*Qian* (Heaven) is the image of the ruler; *Kun* (Earth) comes to interact with *Qian* to form *Li*. This embodies the principle of ministers serving the ruler with loyalty. Thus, when *Li* ascends to the heavens, it becomes *Dayou* (Great Possession), where the yielding attains a noble position. If reversed, it descends to become *Tongren* (Fellowship with Men). When *Li* emerges above the earth, it becomes *Jin* (Progress), where the sun is received thrice in a day. If reversed, it enters the earth to become *Mingyi* (Darkening of the Light). All this serves to exalt the yang and suppress the yin, ever fearful that the brilliance of the yang might fail to rise in the heavens.\n\nIts other manifestations scatter among the hexagrams, each fulfilling its function: as the cauldron for cooking, as the nobility of human culture, as the abundance of the sun at its zenith, or as the reform of the calendar and the reckoning of time. But in *Kui* (Opposition), *Shi* (Biting Through), *Lü* (The Wanderer), and *Jiaren* (The Family), *Li* is inverted. Its image is named \"Great Yang,\" the primal source of all things. Even the moon and stars borrow its light to adorn the heavens—how much more so for the myriad beings?\n\nKing Wen was imprisoned at Youli and suffered the misfortune of *Mingyi* (Darkening of the Light). Yet he was able to expound the *Changes*, laying the foundation for the Ten Wings transmitted by Confucius. Thus, Confucius’ sun followed King Wen’s, succeeding one another to illuminate the world, establishing the constant order of day and night—was this not the great fortune of all under heaven and later generations?\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Six, concludes.\n\n**Tian Yuan Fa Wei, Scroll Seven**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; Collated by Fang Hui Wanli of Xugu*\n\n**The Great Yin (Taiyin)**\n\n*The Shuo Gua* states: \"Kan represents water and the moon; the moon is the essence of water.\"\n\n*The Hetu: Di Lan* says: \"The essence of metal is Kan, with one yang residing within. Internally bright and externally dark, it becomes the moon in heaven and water on earth.\"\n\nHu Shi remarks: \"The moon’s body is Kan, its yang employed by yin. Yang moves swiftly, while yin governs the night.\"\n\n*The Liben Yi* states: \"When the sun appears at dawn, it is called *na* (reception); when it appears at dusk, it is called *tiao* (leaping).\"\n\n*The Wu Xing Zhuan* says: \"When the moon appears in the west at dusk, it is called *tiao*. When it appears in the east at dawn, it is called *ce* (sidelong). Concealment is also named *tiao-na*. When *tiao* occurs, the lords and kings relax; when *ce* or concealment occurs, they hasten.\"\n\n*The Tai Xuan* commentary notes: \"*Tiao* describes the appearance of change. *Tiao* means visibility. The moon appearing in the east at dawn is called *ce*; appearing in the west at dusk is called *tiao*. The sun is male, the moon female—they traverse the heavens without cease.\"\n\n*The Sitian Kao* states: \"When the moon departs in *tiao* or *pu*, it is adjusted according to the calendar. When the sun’s path involves *tiao-na*, it is applied with *han* (shouting).\" It further says: \"The sun’s path and moon’s departure determine the fixed numbers of *tiao-na*, with *tiao-han* and *na-jia* (addition).\"\n\n*The Zhou Pi* says: \"The moon is born where the sun shines; its *po* (lunar essence) arises where the sun is obscured. When aligned with the sun, its light is full; when approaching the sun, its light is exhausted.\"\n\nJing Fang observes: \"Though it has form, it has no light; only when illuminated by the sun does it shine. Where the sun shines, it is bright; where it does not, it remains dark. The moon is *que* (deficient)—when full, it wanes. In the *Xiantian* system, Qian is one and Dui is two; the moon begins from Dui because its motion falls short of the sun’s count.\"\n\nBoth the sun and moon experience waxing and waning. When the sun waxes and the moon wanes, the full moon comes after the midpoint and before the new moon. When the moon waxes and the sun wanes, the full moon comes before the midpoint and after the new moon.\n\nMaster Zhang states: \"The moon is yin essence, the reverse of yang. Where the moon is positioned in yang, it receives the sun’s light but not its essence. At opposition and quadrature, its light is eclipsed—essence cannot be divided.\"\n\nHe further says: \"The essences of the sun and moon mutually reside in each other’s domains.\"\n\nZhu Hanshang remarks: \"*Tai* (Peace) signifies the union of heaven and earth, through which the myriad things communicate. *Pi* (Stagnation) means no union, no communication. *Tai* corresponds to Kan’s nine-five, where water qi ascends. Kan is the body of Kun, and the yang within Kan is two-five. Yang flows into yin, so the moon retreats swiftly. The moon’s body is not bright; it awaits the sun to shine. Brightness is Qian. Qian speaks of the sun and moon’s combined brilliance—Kan and Li mutually employed. *Yu* (Enthusiasm) speaks of the sun and moon not transgressing: Kan is the moon, Li the sun, and they meet in the north. *Heng* (Constancy) speaks of the sun and moon attaining heaven: Qian’s nine-four transforms into Li and Kan.\"\n\nIn *Xiaoxu*’s top nine, *Zhongfu*’s six-four, and *Guimei*’s six-five, the moon nears fullness. In *Xiaoxu*, four conceals Kan, and Xun conceals Zhen. The moon is in the east, the sun in the west—this is fullness. In *Fusong*, Kan transforms into Zhen: the moon in the east is also fullness. In *Guimei*’s six-five, the moon is in the east, the sun in the west—also fullness. In *Xiaoxu* and *Zhongfu*, Kan is in four; in *Guimei*’s six-five, the line is in five. When Kan is in four or five, it is centered. Thus, when the sun opposes the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed—Kan and Li contend for dominance.\n\nSomeone asks: \"Kan is water, Li is fire—how can fire cling to water?\" The answer: \"Li is not bright without water, having no place to attach. Kan is not bright without Li, having no source of generation. When water gathers, essence gathers; when essence gathers, spirit arises. Burning firewood produces charcoal; withered wood becomes ash. Rotten wood glows at night, but when moisture is exhausted, the light dims. Blood becomes *zoulin* (will-o’-the-wisp), seen on dark, rainy nights. Thus it is said: *Li* means *li* (attachment). When Kan’s water is exhausted, Li has nothing to cling to.\"\n\nHengqu states: \"The sun, moon, and five planets move contrary to heaven while encompassing the earth. The moon is yin essence, the reverse of yang, so its rightward motion is swift. The sun’s substance is fundamentally yin; the moon’s substance is fundamentally yang. At the new and full moons, their essences and spirits reverse and exchange, causing eclipses and the laws of waxing and waning. The moon is closer to humans; the sun is distant. Thus, the moon receives the sun’s light always on its outer side. When viewed from earth, its beginning and end appear curved like a hook, and at its zenith, like a half-jade disk—proof of its waxing and waning. Metal and water have inner light, able to repel and receive the essences of yin and yang. Mutually residing in each other’s domains, each attains its proper place. Thus, the forms of the sun and moon remain unchanged through the ages.\"\n\nSomeone asked Master Cheng: \"The moon has a fixed *po*, and the sun is farther than the moon. Does the moon’s reception of the sun’s light cause its waxing and waning as seen by humans?\" He replied: \"The sun and moon are one—how could the sun be higher than the moon? If the moon had no waxing and waning, how would the year be completed? When the moon gains one part of light, its *po* wanes by one part. The moon does not receive the sun’s light, hence the eclipse. When it does not receive the sun’s light, the moon is precisely aligned with yin opposing yang. Drumming assists yang—thus, the green of the sun and moon can both be drummed. The moon does not descend below the sun; when directly opposite, it eclipses the sun. A slight eclipse quickly recovers because it cannot overcome its constant nature. Between the sun and moon, there is a distinction of yin and yang, honor and humility. Near the ruler, its power diminishes; far from the ruler, its influence grows. Thus, when the moon is far from the sun, its light is full; when near, its brightness wanes. Before fullness, it rises in the west; after fullness, it rises in the east.\"\n\nYang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* states: \"Before fullness, the moon carries its *po* in the west; after fullness, it completes its *po* in the east.\" This means that when the moon is newly born, the sun’s light is cast upon the *po*’s west, filling its east—only at fullness does it become round.\n\nAfter fullness, the moon’s light fully occupies the east of its *po*, gradually waning in the west until it vanishes at the dark of the moon. The moon borrows the sun’s light to shine; before fullness, the sun lies to its right, and after fullness, the sun lies to its left—thus each receives light according to its position.\n\nMaster Zhu remarked that Yang Xiong’s two lines were mistakenly phrased. The *Book of Documents* states: “In the first month, on *renchen*, the *po* dies at its side.” It also says: “In the fourth month, the light begins to be born.” The *Record of Rites* states: “Three and five to fullness, three and five to waning.” Cai Jiufeng said: “The first month establishes *yin*; this is the first month of the year. It is not called the ‘proper’ month but the ‘first’ because the Shang dynasty established *chou*. Here, ‘the first month’ refers to the first month. The second day is the death of the *po*—the new moon. The *po* dying at its side is the second day. The first light of the moon appears on the third day.” The *Treatise on the Calendar* states: “When the moon is nearly new but not yet visible, the day is called the death of the *po*. When it forms light in the evening, it is called *chu*.” Master Chen said: “Some take the ‘beginning of light’ as the third day of the moon. Tang scholar Kong believed that both the birth of light and the death of the *po* occur at the start of the month—how could this be the same as the new moon? The moon’s light begins faintly; as light is born, the *po* dies. Thus, it is the first death of the *po*, for when the *po* dies, light is born. The first day of the moon is the birth of light; the second day is the *po* dying at its side. By the full moon, light is fully born and the *po* fully dead. From the day after fullness, the moon’s *po* begins to be born. As the *po* is born, light dies. By the dark of the moon, light is fully dead and the *po* fully born. Thus, the end of the month is called *hui* (darkness), for the *po* is entirely dark. The beginning of the month is called *shuo* (new moon), for its light is first seen. Observing the dark and new moons, Zheng Xuan’s interpretation should be considered correct. Various scholars take ‘the beginning of the *po*’ as the sixteenth day. Yet the *po* begins to be born the day after fullness, and fullness may fall on the fifteenth, sixteenth, or fourteenth day—it cannot be fixed. The sixteenth day is not necessarily the birth of the *po*.”\n\nMaster Kaoting said: “The length of the month is calculated as twenty-nine and twenty-nine four-hundred-ninetieths days. Observe when the new moon occurs. When the month is long, the third day sees the first light; when short, the second day. From the first light to the first quarter is fifteen days, and the full moon’s light is complete—this is the birth\n\nMaster Kaoting further stated: “From the last quarter to the dark moon, the moon and sun become indistinct. The moon lies behind the sun, its light entirely concealed, its body hidden. When the *po* overlays the sun, a solar eclipse occurs; when it lies behind the sun, there is no eclipse. At the dark and new moons, the sun and moon are conjoined.”\n\nThe *Chu Ci* asks: “What virtue does the night’s light possess, that in death it revives? What benefit does it seek, that the hare ever dwells within its belly?” This questions what virtue the moon holds to die and be reborn, and what advantage it gains by gazing back, that the hare constantly resides within it.\n\nThe answer states: “According to the old theories of calendar scholars, at the new moon the moon gradually moves away from the sun, so the *po* dies and brightness is born. After the full moon, it gradually approaches the sun, so the *po* is born and brightness dies. By the dark moon and new moon, it moves away from the sun again, and brightness is reborn. This is what is meant by ‘dying and reviving.’” This explanation is mistaken. If it were true, then before the full moon, the west would be near and the east far, and the newly born brightness should appear on the moon’s eastern side. After the full moon, the east would be near and the west far, and the not-yet-dead brightness should appear on the moon’s western side. How could it be that before the full moon the *po* is borne on the west, and after the full moon the *po* ends on the east, while brightness is distant from the sun? Thus, Shen Kuo’s explanation is the correct one.\n\nHe said: “The moon itself has no light; it is like a silver pellet, which shines only when illuminated by the sun. When the light first appears, the sun lies beside it, so the light is slanted, and what is seen is but a hook. As it moves farther away, the light shines obliquely and gradually fills out. Generally, it is like a pellet of nine measures, with powder applied to half: viewed from the side, the powdered part appears like a hook; viewed directly, it is perfectly round.”\n\nWang Pu of later times further developed this theory, saying: “On the evening when the moon’s brightness is born, only a hook is seen. When the sun and moon are in opposition, a person standing between them sees its fullness. Yet at the quarters and dark moon, it is no different from the full moon—people simply do not see it. From this, we know the moon’s light is always full; its waxing and waning arise from the observer’s position and perspective, not from death and revival.”\n\nThe moon is a yin essence, its form round and substance clear. When illuminated by the sun’s light, its brightness is seen; when not illuminated, it is but *po*. At the full moon, when the sun and moon are in opposition and a person stands between them, the moon’s brightness is fully visible, and its form is round. At the first and last quarters, the sun illuminates its side, and a person observes it from the side, so half is bright and half is *po*. On the day of the dark moon, the sun shines upon its outer surface, while a person stands within, so it is not seen.\n\nHe further said: “Within the moon’s brightness lies a dark void, its darkness exceedingly subtle. At the full moon, the moon and sun are directly opposite, without the slightest deviation. The moon is struck by the dark void, hence the eclipse. Though this is yin overcoming yang, it is ultimately inauspicious. If yin had the intention to retreat, it would not reach this point; it is their direct opposition that causes the eclipse.”\n\nZhang Heng of the Han said: “Fire emits light outward, while water contains reflections. The moon’s light arises from where the sun shines, and its *po* arises from where the sun is obscured. When facing the sun, its light is full; when approaching the sun, its light is exhausted. The stars are illuminated by its light, which is turned by water. When opposite the sun, its light is never fully united because it is obscured by the earth—this is called the dark void. When the stars or a faint moon encounter it, they cause the sun’s old eclipse. Its brightness: looking from darkness to light, the light is unobstructed, so it appears like fire. When at mid-heaven, heaven and earth share its brightness. Looking from brightness to union, union still has its奪 (seizure), so it appears like water. Fire blazes at night but is not bright in daylight.”\n\nI say: “The theory of the dark void originates here. The so-called dark void is yin embracing yang to form the moon. *Kan* is the moon, and the single yang line within *Kan* is originally the single yin line within *Li*. *Qian* enters *Kun* to become the moon, and *Kun* enters *Qian* to become the sun. At the full moon, the sun and moon are in opposition, and the pure essences meet, so *Li* faces the sun with the body of *Qian*, seeking to absorb the single yang line within the moon—hence the moon is eclipsed. What is called the dark void is precisely the single yin line within *Li*. This is an evident matter, yet no one in ancient times ever spoke of it.”\n\nHe further said: “When the moon is near the sun, its light appears as a single crescent. As it moves farther away, its light gradually increases. For example, when the sun is at noon and the moon is at *you*, it is near one and far three, forming a quarter. At the full moon, the sun is in the west and the moon in the east; a person below gazes up and sees its light in full.”\n\nThe *Hun Yi Lüe Shuo* states: “The moon moves swiftly while the sun moves leisurely; it takes slightly more than twenty-nine days for them to meet. Thus, in one year they conjoin twelve times. Their conjunction forms the dark moon, and from the dark moon, revival begins—brightness is born anew. This is called the swift movement of the new moon, gradually distancing itself from the sun. In terms of the celestial sphere, its nearness to the sun is slightly more than ninety-one degrees, and its distance from the sun is slightly more than 374 degrees. This is what is meant by ‘near one, far three’ forming the quarter—this is the first quarter. As it moves farther and opposes the sun, the distance is slightly more than 182 degrees and 62 minutes—this is called mutual opposition. Dividing the center of heaven forms the full moon, for the sun and moon are in opposition. After passing the center, it is distant from the sun by slightly more than 274 degrees. This is what is meant by ‘near one, far three’ forming the quarter—this is the last quarter. The first quarter typically occurs on the eighth day, the last quarter on the twenty-second day, and the full moon on the fifteenth day—this is the norm. The first quarter may occasionally retreat to the seventh day or advance to the ninth; the last quarter may retreat to the twenty-first day or advance to the twenty-third. The full moon may retreat to the fourteenth day or advance to the sixteenth—these are its variations.”\n\nThe first quarter is when the moon waxes to half, resembling the upper string of a bow. The last quarter is when the moon wanes by half, resembling the lower string of a bow.\n\nIt is also said: The *Xiantian Diagram* depicts the phases of a month, progressing from *Fu* to *Zhen*. On the third day, the moon begins to brighten. By *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon reaches its first quarter. On the fifteenth day, at *Qian*, it is the full moon. At *Xun*, the moon begins to wane, on the eighteenth day. At *Gen*, it is the last quarter, on the twenty-third day. At *Kun*, the moon becomes new, on the thirtieth day. In a single breath, there are the new moon, crescent, quarter, and full moon.\n\nThe first quarter is when qi begins to grow, descending from above. The last quarter is when qi begins to wane, ascending from below. The full moon is when qi reaches its fullness below, and the moon becomes round above. Between the new moon and the crescent, the sun and moon conjoin above—this is like \"using water to extinguish fire\" or \"metal returning to its original nature.\"\n\nThe terms *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* refer to the sun’s rising and setting at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six trigrams’ directions.\n\nIt is further said: The phases—waxing brightness, waning darkness, quarters, full moon, new moon, and crescent—are all named according to their orientation toward or away from the sun. From the waxing brightness to the first quarter, as the sun sets in the west, the moon follows and begins to grow. The dark part generates brightness, facing downward to meet the sun, and light arises from below. By the time it reaches the midpoint, how could it not form the upper string, appearing before the full moon?\n\nAfter the full moon until the last quarter, as the sun rises in the east, the moon follows and begins to wane. The bright part generates darkness, facing upward to distance itself from the sun. The light from before the full moon entirely transforms into darkness. Brightness retreats and dies from below, and when it reaches the quarter again, it becomes like metal and water. As before, it reaches the midpoint, how could it not form the lower string, appearing after the full moon?\n\nIt is also said: *Zhen* is one, *Dui* one, *Qian* three, *Xun* four, *Gen* five, and *Kun* six—each five days form a node. The beginning of the crescent marks the start of the moon’s activity, the initial interaction of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. After the twenty-sixth day, until the second day, it is *Kun*. When the sun moves to *Zhen*, the moon gains one part of light. At *Dui*, the moon gains two parts of light. At *Qian*, the moon’s entire body is illuminated.\n\nAfter the sixteenth day until *Xun*, the moon’s light gradually wanes. By the time of the new moon and crescent, the sun and moon converge, and no light is visible. The sun and moon meet and separate at the new moon. The moon is obscured, revealing its dark side, so its yin body is fully visible—this is the new moon. Representing *Kun*, at this time the moon is in the *yi* direction, and the sun is in *yi*; since they conjoin, *Kun* corresponds to *yi*. When the moon reaches the new moon, it moves from east to north to meet the sun. East is *yi*; north is *gui*. *Yi* diminishes into *gui*, converging at *Qian* and *Ren*. *Ren* and *gui* are where the qi of the north gathers. After twelve meetings, all things flourish, and the moon reappears at *Zhen* and *Dui*.\n\nOnly after heaven and earth interact does *Zhen* arise. *Zhen* is the beginning of heaven and earth’s interaction and the flourishing of all things. When *Kun* ends at *yi* and *gui*, *Qian* begins at *Zhen* and *geng*. The full moon, new moon, and crescent follow one another endlessly.\n\nIn the first node, on the third day, it is pure yin. When the first yang begins to interact in the center, a single line of light appears, and the moon takes the form of *Zhen*. At this time, the moon is faintly visible in the west at the *geng* position, while the sun is just setting below the earth, so *Zhen* corresponds to *geng*. After six days, in the second node, two yangs generate brightness, half illuminating the dark part—this is the first quarter. The moon takes the form of *Dui*, faintly visible in the south at the *xin* position.\n\nAfter another six days, in the middle of the third node, on the fifteenth day, it is full and pure yang, and the moon takes the form of *Qian*. It is faintly visible in the east at the *jia* position, receiving light as the sun aligns with the earth’s surface. After the full moon, at the beginning of the fourth node on the sixteenth day, the *Qian* body begins to receive the first yin, becoming *Xun* and generating darkness. The moon takes the form of *Xun*, setting in the west at the *xin* position as the sun aligns with it.\n\nAfter another six days, in the middle of the fifth node, on the twenty-second day, one yang is restored. The first yin in the center forms *Gen*, and the moon takes the form of *Gen*, setting at dawn in the south at the *bing* position. On the thirtieth day, the sixth node ends, all three yangs transform, and the light is entirely extinguished as the moon’s body hides in the northwest. After the six nodes of a month are complete, they pass to the next month, and the *Zhen* trigram reappears.\n\nChapter Fourteen of the *Cantong Qi* states:\n*Gen* aligns with the south at *bing*, the last quarter on the twenty-third day.\n*Kun* at *yi* on the thirtieth day, in the northeast its light is lost.\nWhen the nodes are exhausted, they pass and the body continues, the dragon is reborn thus.\n\nRegarding the *Na Jia* system: The father *Qian* corresponds to *jia-zi* and *ren-wu*. *Zhen*, the eldest son, inherits the father’s body and corresponds to *geng-zi* and *geng-wu*—*zi* and *wu* are the same as *Qian*. The mother *Kun* corresponds to *yi-wei* and *gui-chou*. *Xun*, the eldest daughter, inherits the mother’s body and corresponds to *xin-chou* and *xin-wei*—*chou* and *wei* are the same as *Kun*. *Kan*, the middle son, corresponds to *wu-yin* and *wu-shen*. *Gen*, the youngest son, corresponds to *bing-xu* and *bing-chen*. *Li*, the middle daughter, corresponds to *ji-mao* and *ji-you*. *Dui*, the youngest daughter, corresponds to *ding-si* and *ding-hai*.\n\n*Ren*, *gui*, *geng*, *xin*, *wu*, *ji*, *bing*, *ding*, *jia*, and *yi* proceed from below to above. *Qian* and *Kun* each use two, encompassing the six children within, enabling generation and transformation. *Wu* and *ji* are the central earth. *Kan* yang corresponds to *wu*, and *Li* yin corresponds to *ji*—yin and yang each reside in their proper place at the center. *Ren* is the essence of yang, *jia* the head of yang, *gui* the blood of yin, and *yi* the beginning of yin. The two elders envelop and conceal, with *Kan* and *Li* acting at the center—this is the divine work of heaven and earth’s creation.\n\nThree hundred eighty-four lines form the number of a complete celestial cycle. Each line governs one day, and four trigrams govern twenty-four lines to correspond to the twenty-four qi.\n\nA single month encompasses the crescent, full, waning, and new moons; a single day encompasses *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Speaking of one day, then one month and one year are all contained within it. From *zi* to *si*, light is born, and within this lies the first quarter leading to the full moon. From *wu* to *hai*, the lunar essence is born, and within this lies the last quarter returning to darkness. The twelve hours correspond to the twelve sovereign hexagrams, and the seventy-two lines correspond to the seventy-two seasonal nodes.\n\nSpeaking of one month, the two crescents above and below correspond to the two eights of yin and yang, and the three hundred sixty hours correspond to the three hundred sixty lines—further mirroring the three hundred sixty days. Speaking of one year, the six lines of the *na jia* system divide into the twelve sovereign hexagrams, doubled. The work of the year is thus completed, the labor of a full year condensed within a single month. Observing the year through the month, the month through the day, the day through the hours, and the hours through the *ke*—even within a single *ke* of effort, the qi and seasonal signs of an entire year are present. The subtlety of creation’s workings may be minutely examined thus.\n\nMaster Shao said: The moon embraces yang as yin—it is yang within yin. As yang wanes, yin arises, so the sun descends while the moon rises in the west. When yin flourishes, it contends with yang, so at the full moon, the moon rises in the east. Heaven is the father, the sun the child—thus heaven revolves leftward. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife—thus the sun rises in the east while the moon is born in the west. When the moon is distant from the sun, its light is born and its motion slows; when near, its essence is born and its motion quickens—this is the principle of ruler and minister.\n\nThough the sun moves rightward, it follows heaven’s leftward turn. Though the moon moves swiftly, it meets the sun only after the sun has passed, ever trailing behind. That stars follow the moon is seen at night. According to various calendrical theories: from the first to the fourth day, the moon moves fastest, traversing over fourteen degrees in a day and night. From the twenty-fourth day to the new moon, it is again swift, moving at the same rate. From the fifth to the eighth day, its motion is next fastest, traversing over thirteen degrees daily. From the twentieth to the twenty-third day, it moves slightly faster, at the same rate. From the ninth to the nineteenth day, its motion slows, traversing over twelve degrees daily. Averaged over a month, it moves thirteen and seven-nineteenths degrees per day. Distant from the sun, its light is born and its motion slows; near, its essence is born and its motion quickens—here too lies the principle of ruler and minister.\n\nThe moon has no light of its own but borrows from the sun. When it waxes full, it contends with yang—how cautious must a ruler be! Heaven revolves leftward, the sun moves rightward. The sun rises in the east, the moon is born in the west—this is the principle of father and son, husband and wife. That the full moon also rises in the east is to contend with yang, an irregular path.\n\nI offer this explanation: Heaven is greatest, the sun next, the moon next still. Thus the sun’s motion does not match heaven’s, nor the moon’s the sun’s. One exalted, one humble—each has its measure, and this is heaven’s teaching. King Wen expounded the *Yi* at *Kan*, speaking of practice through images, saying the moon has one yang at its center, encircled by two yins. In a year’s twelve solar terms, the moon always follows the sun and dares not precede yang—its meaning is profound. Yin assists yang to complete the year’s work, and the moon’s aid is indispensable. Yet when yin overreaches yang to encroach upon the noble, vigilance is all the more essential.\n\nThus in *Qian*, the text speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"their light conjoined.\" In *Jia*, it speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"not transgressing.\" In *Da*, it speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"attaining heaven.\" Though sun and moon are mentioned together, the moon is never placed before the sun—all to convey the intent of exalting yang and restraining yin. Where the moon alone is taken as a warning, the meaning is especially urgent. In *Xiaoxu*, the moon nears fullness and danger arises, for it harbors hidden *Kan* and *Xun* contains hidden *Zhen*. The moon is in the east, the sun in the west. *Xiaoxu*’s single yin overreaches the yang of the ninth line—hence the omen is dire. In *Guimei*, the sixth line, the moon also nears fullness yet brings fortune, for *Kan* moon is in the east, *Li* sun in the west. Yin and yang reside at the center, and though sun and moon face each other, nearing fullness they do not contend—hence the omen is auspicious.\n\nThus the moon may govern night but not day—such is the Way of Heaven, how much more so for man! When the moon opposes the sun, a lunar eclipse occurs; when the moon obscures the sun, a solar eclipse occurs. Yin must not contend with yang, ministers must not overreach rulers, wives must not overreach husbands, the petty must not overreach the noble. Master Cheng said: A minister occupying the ruler’s position—Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo are examples—is still speakable. A woman occupying the ruler’s position—Nüwa and Empress Wu are examples—is an extraordinary aberration, unspeakable.\n\nThe *Han Annals* states: The moon revolves rightward, aligning with the *Xiantian* diagram’s eight trigrams. The *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars* says: The sun has dark and new moons, the moon has crescents and fullness. The sun is yang, the moon yin—yin qi is ever present, while yang is consumed and refined. After the new moon, the moon moves rightward, gradually departing the sun and light is born. Around the seventh or eighth day, it reaches the first quarter, half-illuminated. By the fifteenth day, the moon is farthest from the sun, fully bright. After the full moon, it gradually nears the sun’s left side, and brightness wanes. Around the twenty-second or twenty-third day, the moon is half-bright again—this is the last quarter. On the thirtieth day, sun and moon conjoin, the moon’s light consumed by the sun—this is the dark moon.\n\nAmong various theories, only this is credible. I have compared the hexagrams with the twelve earthly branches: on the dark moon, the hexagram is *Kun*, sun and moon meet at *zi*, and the moon’s light is extinguished. Between the dark and new moons, it revolves rightward from *Kun*, and the hexagram becomes *Gen*—yang is born, light appearing externally. Between *xu* and *hai*, it turns due west to the *Kan* hexagram—one yang resides at the center, far from the sun at mid-heaven—this is the first quarter. At midnight, it is at *you*; the sun rises in the east, illuminating the western half of the moon—hence it is said: \"Within it is the cock.\"\n\nYou and *mao* stand opposite each other. Advancing further, the hexagram becomes *Xun*—two yang lines shine externally, while the lunar essence (*po*) remains only within. At midnight, it resides between *wei* and *shen*, midway between the first quarter and full moon. As the sun’s illumination grows more direct, the moon turns to *Qian* at noon, while the sun stands directly above or below *Kun* at *zi*, their opposition creating full illumination—hence its name: the full moon.\n\nThen, turning left from *Li* at *wu* toward the interval between *chen* and *si*, what once faced *xu* and *hai* to generate brightness now generates the lunar essence. As the sun’s light shines obliquely, one yin arises externally, forming the *Dui* hexagram. *Dui* turns to *Li*, and the moon stands due east, half the sky distant from the sun; the lunar essence returns to the center—this is the last quarter. At midnight, it is at *mao*; the moon rises in the west, illuminating the eastern half—hence it is said: \"Within it is the hare.\"\n\nProceeding to *Zhen*, it again stands opposite *Xun*. In *Xun*, one yin gradually wanes and the moon waxes full; in *Zhen*, two yin lines grow strong and the moon wanes. The sun draws nearer, brightness remaining only within; at midnight, it resides between *chou* and *yin*, midway between the last quarter and dark moon, until at *Kun* the moon is extinguished.\n\nThe sequence of hexagrams begins in the north and proceeds west because the moon’s motion retreats in degree and turns rightward. The sequence of lines proceeds from external to internal because the moon receives the sun’s light from without to within. This explanation accords well with the *Han Annals* and the *Xiantian* hexagrams.\n\nSome say: the sun is measured at *wu*, the moon at *zi*, and the stellar lodges at dusk and dawn. The author of the *Cantong Qi* failed to grasp the moon’s retrograde motion and the principle of receiving light from without, thus seizing upon *Kan* and *Li* as central while taking *Zhen* as the birth of brightness and *Dui* as the first quarter—this is entirely backward. Though he overturned the explanations of earlier scholars and deemed it a revelation of the moon’s ancient secrets, I consider this but one interpretation within the *Book of Changes*. Yet Master Zhu’s investigations in the *Cantong Qi Kaozhu* were most precise. Moreover, what Wei Boyang transmitted has endured from the Han to the present for over a thousand years, and no former worthy has ever refuted it—how could one lightly dismiss it?\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Seven, concludes.\n\nThe Lesser Yang’s stellar phenomena are manifold and defy exhaustive exposition. Stars are the essence of primordial *qi*. Master Shao said: “The Lesser Yang gives rise to stars.” Zhang Lingxian stated: “The celestial offices within and beyond the central palace number one hundred twenty-four in constant brightness, with three hundred twenty named. The stars themselves total two thousand five hundred, while the faint stars number eleven thousand five hundred twenty.” Master Luo often remarked to me that astrologers, like the *aili* people, leave one utterly bewildered. To grasp the myriad forms of the cosmos, one need not look beyond the finger-signs of the Five Phases. From the Supreme Ultimate’s division into Yin and Yang, Yin and Yang unfold into the Five Phases. The Five Stars are the essence of the Five Phases. The sun, moon, and Five Stars constitute the Seven Governors. Scattered across the four directions, each direction has its seven lodges. Including the Northern Dipper at the center, there are five times seven—thirty-five names—all inseparable from the Five Phases. Thus, Ban Gu said: “The Supreme Ultimate moves the Three Luminaries and Five Stars above at the *shangyuan*; *qi* revolves the Three Sequences and Five Phases below among men. The imperial throne embodies the Three Powers and Five Affairs at the center, dividing into the Three Talents—what lies beyond the Five Phases?” Master Ouyang said: “Yao commanded Xi and He to observe the central stars and rectify the four seasons, keeping the Dao simple. Descending to later ages, the methods grew increasingly refined, accumulating the wisdom of many before attaining their utmost subtlety. During the Three Dynasties, lost texts lay scattered, and the Six Classics offered no confusion—yet the affairs of Heaven and man are hard to speak of. What remains today takes the Five Phases as its foundation, not daring to compare with the starry chronicles of history.”\n\nMaster Shao said: “The theory of the Five Stars began with Gan Gong and Shi Gong.” The Five Stars’ theory was unheard of in antiquity. The *Book of Yu* merely states: “They pacified the Five Luminaries.” By the time of Gan and Shi, it was fully revealed. Shi Shen was a man of Wei who composed the *Star Canon*. Gan De was his contemporary. Stars have three colors to distinguish the three schools’ differences: those from Shi appear red, those from Gan appear black, and those from Wu Xian appear yellow. The purple palace and all stars within and beyond it also derive from the three schools, totaling three hundred eighty-three names and seven hundred eighty-three stars. What is applied in the sphere-school are only the celestial pole, Northern Dipper, and twenty-eight lodges, essential for divination. The rest are recorded merely to complete the celestial body’s full image.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “The Five Wefts are the essence of the Five Stars.” Ban Gu said: “The Five Stars move eastward while the heavens turn west. The constant stars serve as the warp, the Five Stars as the weft. Interweaving warp and weft, they form celestial patterns.” The refined *qi* of the Five Phases, when forming shapes on earth, coalesce into wood, fire, soil, metal, and water. When forming images in the heavens, wood aligns with Jupiter in the east, fire with Mars in the south, metal with Venus in the west, water with Mercury in the north, and soil with Saturn at the center. In man, wood’s spirit is benevolence, associated with appearance; fire’s spirit is propriety, associated with vision; metal’s spirit is righteousness, associated with speech; water’s spirit is wisdom, associated with hearing; and soil’s spirit is trust, associated with thought and the heart. Distributed across the four seasons, wood flourishes in spring, fire in summer, metal in autumn, and water in winter, each dominating for seventy-two days. Soil flourishes in the four seasons—during the months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—for eighteen days each, totaling three hundred sixty. Their colors are: wood green, fire red, metal white, water black, and soil yellow. Their terrestrial correspondences each have their place, further varying in dominance, mutual generation, rest, and decline. Their colors differ: when dominant, they shine with radiance; when mutually generating, they are inwardly full; when at rest, their radiance lacks edges and does not sway; when in decline, their light diminishes in color. A white halo portends mourning; a red halo, war; a green halo, summer floods; a black halo, plagues and many deaths; a yellow halo, good fortune. White horns herald sounds of weeping; red horns, assaults on our cities; black horns, floods and exhausted armies.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: “When the Five Stars share the same color, the world lays down its arms, the people live in peace, the five grains flourish, spring winds and autumn rains come in season, winter is cold and summer hot, the sun does not eclipse at the new moon, nor the moon at the full. This is a state with the Dao, and a sage must occupy its throne.”\n\n**Jupiter**—Wood’s nature is gentle and upright. Historians say it oversees the faults of the world’s rulers. It governs the year’s five grains, dividing the four seven lodges into twelve stations. It traverses one station per year, with the Great Year in *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. At the four cardinal points, it moves through three lodges per year, with the Great Year in *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*. At the four initial and final points—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—it moves through two lodges per year. Two times eight is sixteen, three times four is twelve, totaling twenty-eight lodges. Jupiter completes one celestial circuit in twelve years, forming one cycle. The Great Year is Yin, moving left in *yin*. Jupiter is Yang, turning right in *chou*. When the Great Year is in *mao*, Jupiter resides in *zi*; when in *chen*, Jupiter resides in *hai*, and so forth. Thus, when the Great Year is in *yin*, Jupiter first appears in the east in the first month; when in *mao*, it appears in the east at dawn in the second month. From this, the rest can be deduced. The land where Jupiter resides enjoys good fortune. If it deviates from its station, the opposite land suffers misfortune. Greater calamity follows greater deviation, lesser calamity follows lesser deviation, and no fault arises if it does not deviate.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Wood embodies the waxing and waning of a year. The *chen* station is where it transitions each month, bearing the image of a year.”\n\n**Mars**—Fire’s nature is fierce and violent, thus it governs the execution of laws. It regularly enters the Supreme Subtlety in the tenth month, receives restraint, and departs. The stellar lodges oversee the lawless; its movements are irregular, completing one celestial circuit every two years.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Fire is Yin in substance yet Yang in its gathering. Its *qi* is akin to the sun’s, hence its slowness is twice that of the sun.”\n\nThe Fire Star moves from presence to absence, from absence to presence, governed by the transformative *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Saturn**—Earth’s nature is weighty and profound, residing in *wu-si* during late summer. Among the four seasons, it is like the heart in a person, governing the four limbs and all organs. Thus, when the four stars err, Saturn is the first to move. One account says: it governs the feminine image. Another says: it is the Star of the Son of Heaven. When the Son of Heaven loses trust, Saturn stirs greatly. It regularly advances one stellar lodge in the year of *jia-chen* at the origin of the Dipper, completing one celestial circuit every twenty-eight years. Where it lingers long, that land’s virtue is deep.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Saturn’s motion is the slowest, yet it is not entirely bound to Earth.”\n\n**Venus**—Metal’s nature is firm and unyielding, governing military affairs as a Yin star. When it emerges in the east, it should conceal itself in the east; when it emerges in the west, it should conceal itself in the west.\n\nBan said: “It regularly emerges in the east with Mars on *jia-yin* of the first month, remaining visible for two hundred forty days before withdrawing for forty days. It then reappears in the east, emerging at *yin* and *xu*, and withdrawing at *chou* and *wei*. Generally, it completes one celestial circuit each year, nearly matching the sun and moon.”\n\n**Mercury**—Water’s nature is placid and mild, governing the gains and losses of form and law, and rectifying the four seasons. It regularly appears at *Kui* and *Lou* at the spring equinox, at *Dongjing* at the summer solstice, at *Jiao* and *Kang* at the autumn equinox, and at *Qianniu* at the winter solstice. It emerges at *chen* and *xu*, and withdraws at *chou* and *wei*. It is observed in the east at dawn and in the west at dusk. If it fails to appear for one season, that season is disharmonious. If it fails to appear for all four seasons, the realm suffers great famine. It also completes one celestial circuit each year.\n\nSome say: Mercury is the Hour Star, with eleven hours in a season and twelve meetings in a month. Scattered between Heaven and Earth, it acts everywhere without exception. When its moisture and nourishment appear untimely, cold and heat lose their rhythm, thus it embodies the image of the Great One. For the Water and Fire Stars depend on each other: Fire may be present or absent, Water may be full or parched, both receiving the transformative *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Metal and Water cling to the sun, advancing and retreating before and after it. The principle is profound, residing in things, and its resonance may be known.”\n\nThe *Star Classic* says: “Venus and Mercury follow the sun in their course. When swift, they precede the sun; when slow, they trail it. When swift and preceding the sun, they appear at dusk in the west. When slow and trailing the sun, they appear at dawn in the east.”\n\nThe *Odes* commentary states: “Before the sun rises, it opens the way for the sun’s brightness, hence the Bright Star is called *Qiming* (Starter of Dawn). After the sun sets, it continues the sun’s light, hence the Bright Star is called *Chang Geng* (Long Twilight).”\n\nThe *Han Odes Outer Commentary* further says: “When Venus appears at dawn in the east, it is *Qiming*; when it appears at dusk in the west, it is *Chang Geng*.” It may be that Metal and Water, these two stars, can be spoken of interchangeably.\n\nSun Yan said: “The Bright Star is Venus. When it emerges in the east at dawn, three lodges high, it is called the Bright Star of today. When it emerges in the west at dusk, three lodges high, it is called Venus. Thus *Qiming* is Venus, but what star is *Chang Geng*? It may be that one star appears in both east and west under different names, or that the two are distinct stars—this cannot be determined with certainty.”\n\nMaster Zhu resolved it, saying: “*Chang Geng* is Mercury; *Qiming* is Venus. When Metal is west of the sun, as the sun is about to rise, it appears in the east. When Water is east of the sun, as the sun is about to set, it appears in the west. This saying exhausts the matter.”\n\nZhang Pingzi said: “When *Sheti* and Mars appear at dawn, they cling to the sun; when Venus and Mercury appear at dusk, they cling to the moon. This requires separate investigation.”\n\nMaster Cheng said: “The true primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth converges within the celestial reckoning, so that the sun and moon form a *bi* (jade disk), and the five stars string like pearls—thus giving birth to the Sage. According to the calendar, at the origin of the primordial chaos of high antiquity, the year was named *Yanfeng Jia Shetige Yin*. At the *jiazi* new moon, midnight of the winter solstice, the sun, moon, and five stars all converged at *Zi*, hence the auspicious signs of *bi* and *lian zhu* (connected pearls) appeared, corresponding to the epoch when Emperor Zhuan established the calendar.\n\nAgain, in the first year of the Han dynasty, the ten-month month, the five stars gathered at *Dongjing*, serving as the omen of Emperor Gao’s receipt of the Mandate. Again, in the fifth year of the Qiande reign of the Song, the third month, the five stars aligned like strung pearls, scattered across *Jiang Lou*, signifying the brilliance of culture throughout the realm.\n\nAs Master Cheng said: ‘The true primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth cannot be mingled with wandering *qi*, hence it converges to give birth to the Sage.’ Such was the case with Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Zhou, and Confucius. Here I cite three examples to verify the signs of creation; others need not be exhaustively listed.\n\nI once considered that Emperor Wu changed the reign title to *Taichu* out of admiration for Emperor Zhuan, altering the era to align with that auspicious sign—though in truth, no such celestial configuration occurred in Emperor Wu’s time.\n\nSu Shi of the Dongpo said: “Metal and Water always remain near the sun, no more than ten degrees away. When the sun is at *Ji* and *Wei*, this casts doubt on the claim.” In my view, the Qin took the tenth month as the first. The tenth month corresponds to the present eighth month, and at the seventh-month node, the sun still lingers between *Jiao* and *Yi*. Thus, the gathering of Metal and Water at *Jing* is not so distant. Dongpo’s argument is ultimately based on Han annotations.\n\nThe gathering of the five stars at *Kui* occurred in the domain of Lu, marking the beginning of great peace throughout the realm, as noted by Dou Yi.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The *wei* stars are Yang within Yin; the *jing* stars are Yin within Yang. The five stars are the *qi* of Earth’s Wood, Water, Fire, Soil, and Metal, ascending and coalescing, yet they receive the sun’s light. The *jing* stars are the surplus of Yang *qi*, congealed and flickering, their light unstable. The *wei* stars have rays and points, their inherent light also unmoving, and all receive the sun’s light.”\n\nMaster Zhu also said: “The *jing* stars revolve leftward day and night, completing slightly more than one circuit. Heaven has twelve stations, and now the Weaving Girl star beside the Milky Way ‘seven times daily’—from *mao* to *you*—passes through seven stations.”\n\nThe *Erya* annotation states: The Five Stars all move rightward through the twenty-eight lunar lodges, while the celestial body remains fixed, hence they are called *jing* stars. The Five Stars serve as *wei*, like the warp and weft of woven fabric. However, among the Five *wei*, only the Chen star is difficult to observe, just as the flow of blood through the interstices of flesh and muscle is most subtle. The Chen star belongs to Kan, the Water trigram, which excels in concealment. The Yuan, Ji, Tuo, and Qian rivers flow hidden for over a thousand *li* before emerging. The Celestial Palace and the Emperor’s Mansion are all central *jing* stars. The *wei* stars, being mobile, are Yang, yet Venus and the Chen star are Yin. The *jing* stars, being immobile, are Yin, yet the *Ximu* and *Chunshou* regions are Yang.\n\nShaozi said: The stars that are Yang within Yin are the most minute, like dust and sand, and when they fall, they form mounds. He also said: When stars fall to earth, they become stone. The surplus of stellar Yang, the Five Stars correspond to the human Five Viscera, while the various stars correspond to the human limbs and bones. When essence, blood, and spirit are preserved, essence abides, fulfilling its office and manifesting its luminosity. When spirit wanes and essence scatters, it is like a person’s death. Thus, when stars fall, they become stone.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: When essence scatters and *qi* wanes, Kan reaches its extreme and Li appears, giving rise to falling stars. Their light illuminates the earth like Li. When they fall as stone, mounds, or dust and sand, it is Gen. Once their radiance disperses, *qi* congeals into stone, much like a person’s corporeal form descending to earth.\n\nThe sun, moon, and Five Stars all originate from the beginning of the Oxherd constellation. This corresponds to the Han *Taichu* calendar’s eleventh month, the first day of the new moon, and the winter solstice. The Han scholar Liu stated: Pointing to the beginning of the Oxherd to mark the sun and moon is called *Xingji* (Star Cycle). The Five Stars begin at the start of the Oxherd, while the sun and moon commence from its midpoint, traversing nearly twelve stations. When they reach the beginning, it marks a solar term; when they reach the midpoint, the Dipper’s handle points below, forming the twelve earthly branches. Observing its position reveals the station. The Han scholar Song Zhong said: The winter solstice begins at the first degree of the Oxherd lodge, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to the *zi* position. Du Yu said: The twelve stations begin with *Xingji* and rotate rightward.\n\nThe *Erya* states: *Xingji* begins with the Oxherd, the Dipper and Oxherd constellations. Guo’s annotation says: The Oxherd and Dipper are where the sun, moon, and Five Stars begin and end. The *Zuo Tradition* does not say “winter solstice” but “the sun’s southernmost point,” referring to the sun’s arrival at the Oxherd from *Chunwei*. At noon, the shadow is longest, revealing its southernmost point at the tip of the Dipper’s handle, threading through the Celestial Palace and marking the Weaving Girl’s station.\n\nThe *Lost Books of Zhou* states: In the eleventh month, when the southern culmination occurs, twilight shifts, the sun treads the long path, and faint stars stir in the Yellow Springs. In this month, the Dipper’s handle begins to point north at dusk, while the sun and moon both rise from the Oxherd, moving rightward. The moon completes a circuit of the heavens, beginning a new station, and meets the sun. The sun traverses one station per month, completing a circuit through the twelve earthly branches, ending only to begin anew—this is called the origin of the sun and moon.\n\nI humbly suggest that the profundities of creation are too subtle to be illuminated without synthesizing multiple explanations. The *Star Canon* poses a difficulty: When observing the canopy’s ribs and wheel spokes, those near the hub are dense, while those farther away grow sparse. Now, the North Pole serves as the celestial hub, and the twenty-eight lodges as the canopy’s ribs. Why, then, are they unevenly spaced? The ribs are modeled after the *Zhou Rituals’* carriage-maker, who crafted twenty-eight canopy bows to represent the stars and wheel spokes to symbolize the sun and moon. The sun and moon meet once a month, completing a circuit of the heavens. The moon then moves to the next station, eventually catching up to the sun and sharing a lodge.\n\nThe heavens are round like two covers joined together, with the North and South Poles as the hubs of the two covers, and the twenty-eight lodges as the canopy’s ribs. The celestial equator encircles the heavens’ midsection like the seam where the two covers meet. The region north of the equator forms the inner enclosure, like the upper cover, while the region south forms the outer enclosure, like the lower cover. The equator lies at the heavens’ center, like the seam. The ecliptic crosses obliquely through the equator. Thus, the spacing of the ribs is narrow near the hubs and widens with distance, just as the degrees of the lodges are narrow near the poles and widen toward the equator, reaching their maximum breadth there.\n\nIn a circular chart, the southern stars appear progressively narrower, yet the opposite occurs. In a horizontal chart, the regions far from both poles appear broad, distorting the true shape of the heavens. Now, if we carve the celestial sphere into two circular charts—one facing upward, the other downward—with the chart’s center as the pole, the region north of the equator becomes the *Neiguan* star chart, while the region south becomes the *Waiguan* star chart. When the two charts are joined, they form a complete celestial sphere, accurately reflecting the varying breadth of the star degrees and ensuring precise divination.\n\nThe North Pole is called the upper circle, the South Pole the lower circle, and the equator encircling the heavens is called the middle circle. The middle circle is broad, while the regions near the two poles are extremely narrow.\n\nOuzi said: In the canopy-heavens theory, southern degrees gradually narrow, while in the celestial-sphere theory, the North Pole is elevated. Both explanations may be left unresolved.\n\nThe *Zhou Rituals*’ *Xingtu* distinguishes the nine provinces by their corresponding stars and boundaries, all of which are recorded in the ritual classics and cannot be erased. There are three interpretations: The *Ling Zhoujiu* states: The station where Jupiter resides determines our *fenye* (field allocation). After the loss of the *Gu Kan* and *Yu Shu*, the regions assigned to commanderies and states no longer align with Jupiter’s ancient positions. Some lie north, others west, differing from the original locations of enfeoffment.\n\nDuring the Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, the ten thousand states and 1,773 polities were all affiliated with the twelve principal states, linking them to the twelve celestial stations. This system honored the ancient kings’ intent to prioritize ancestral sacrifices. For example, Ban Bo was enfeoffed at Shangqiu, which governs the Chen station, hence the Shang star, from which the Shang people derived their name. Shi Shen was enfeoffed at Greater Xia, which governs the Shen station, hence the Xia star, from which the Tang people derived their name. Later, Tang became Jin, and Shen became the Jin star—this is the second interpretation.\n\nNow, consolidating the *fenye* stations and lodges: Qingzhou lies in the east, Xuan’gan in the north, Yong in the west, and *Chunshou* in the south.\n\nExtending to the southeast, Yangzhou aligns with the *Xingji* station in the north; Jizhou in the northeast with *Daliang* in the west; Xuzhou in the east with *Jianglou*; and Yuzhou and the Three Rivers occupy the center, while *Dahuo* resides in the due east. This constitutes the third and most divergent arrangement of the celestial stations and lodges. With three interpretations differing, the discerning must choose for themselves.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: \"The five planets heralded the rise of Zhou.\" *Discourses of the States* records: \"When King Wu campaigned against Shang, Jupiter was in *Chunhuo*, the moon in *Tianxi*, the sun in *Ximu*, the hour in the initial *Dou*, and the star in *Tiandian*.\" I have examined this: when Zhou arose, *Chunhuo* stood directly above the void of *Xuanyuan*, where the *Ji* star was bound. The *Fang* mansion and Jupiter intersected as warp and weft, linking to the divine power of the revered *Shen*—Hou Ji was conceived through this influence. *Chunshou* lay to the right of the mountains and rivers, where King Tai flourished and Hou Ji was enfeoffed. When the Zhou army set forth, the sun stood at ten degrees of *Ji*, the ford of *Ximu*; the moon at four degrees of *Fang*, the chariot of *Shengyang*. Three days later, it was the Zhou’s first month, *gengyin*. On the new moon, sun and moon conjoined at one degree of the Southern Dipper, placing the hour at the Dipper’s handle. At that time, Mars advanced with the Zhou army, while Mercury lay concealed in *Tiandian*, signaling the end of the water phase’s dominion to Emperor Zhuan. From *Tiandian* to *Ximu*, Jupiter reached *Chunhuo*, then retrograded to sojourn in *Chunshou* before advancing again to *Niaofu*. This cyclical traversal, weaving the destiny of the Zhou house, was surely not by human effort. Thus, it was fitting that Zhou endured for thirty generations and eight hundred years, the longest of the sagely dynasties. The celestial portents are luminous—how could they not be trusted? Later ages sought to overcome them by human force—how could this be possible?\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"The twenty-eight lodges are divided among the four directions, seven lodges to each, forming a single image. As creatures and beasts exist on earth, their counterparts reside in heaven. In the east, the Azure Dragon, its head to the south and tail to the north; in the west, the White Tiger, likewise south-headed and north-tailed. In the south, the Vermilion Bird, its head to the west and tail to the east; in the north, the Dark Warrior, west-headed and east-tailed. They proceed from *Jiao* in a leftward revolution.\" The *Erya* notes: \"*Shouxing* begins with *Jiao* and *Kang*.\" Guo’s commentary: \"The count begins at *Jiao*, the eldest of the lodges, hence *Shouxing*.\"\n\nThe seven lodges per direction are as follows: from *Dou* to *Bi* is the *Xingwu* (Dark Warrior); from *Kui* to *Shen*, the *Xinghu* (White Tiger); from *Jing* to *Zhen*, the *Xingniao* (Vermilion Bird); from *Jiao* to *Ji*, the *Xinglong* (Azure Dragon). Arrayed around the four directions, they revolve westward with the heavens. Each direction has its fixed stars, though the stars themselves have no fixed abode, appearing and vanishing in their due seasons.\n\nMaster Lin states: \"*Niaohuo*, *Xu*, and *Xu* mark the solstices and equinoxes at dusk, appearing in the southern sky as the culmination stars of the meridian. In the second month of spring, the seven lodges occupy their respective positions: *Xinghuo* in the east, *Niao* in the south, *Xu* in the west, and *Xu* in the north. When the sun is in *Xu* and enters the *You* quadrant at dusk, *Chunhuo* appears in the southern meridian. At this time, day and night are each fifty *ke*—this is the *qi* of the vernal equinox. By the second month of summer, *Niao* turns west, *Huo* turns south, *Xu* turns east, and *Mao* turns north. When the sun is in *Xing* and enters the *Xin* quadrant at dusk, *Dahuo* (*Fang* and *Xin*) appears in the southern meridian. At this time, days are long and nights short—sixty *ke* for day, forty for night—marking the *qi* of the summer solstice. By the second month of autumn, *Huo* turns west, *Xu* turns south, *Mao* turns east, and *Niao* turns north. When the sun is in *Xin* and enters the *You* quadrant at dusk, *Xu* appears in the meridian. Day and night are again equal—fifty *ke* each—this is the *qi* of the autumnal equinox. By the second month of winter, *Xu* turns west, *Mao* turns south, *Niao* turns east, and *Huo* turns north. When the sun is in *Xu* and enters the *Shen* quadrant at dusk, *Mao* appears in the meridian. Days are short and nights long—forty *ke* for day, sixty for night—marking the *qi* of the winter solstice. Once the *qi* of the solstices and equinoxes are fixed, the *qi* of the twelve months are likewise determined. *Xingniao* refers to the image, *Xinghuo* to the station, *Xu* and *Mao* to the lodges—they complement one another.\"\n\nI observe: the *qi* of heaven, earth, and the four seasons all emanate from the center. *Zi* and *Wu* are the midpoints of the two solstices, the center of heaven and earth. *Mao* and *You* are the midpoints of the two equinoxes, the center of yin and yang. The culmination stars of the twenty-eight lodges reach their zenith at the center. When the sage emerges to harmonize and position heaven and earth, it is simply a matter of holding to the center.\n\nThe star counts of the seven lodges: *Xinglong* has thirty-two stars, *Xingwu* thirty-five, *Xinghu* fifty-one, and *Xingniao* sixty-four. Together, they total 182 stars.\n\nThe degrees of the seven lodges: *Xinglong* spans seventy-five degrees, *Xingwu* ninety-eight and one-quarter degrees, *Xinghu* eighty degrees, and *Xingniao* one hundred twenty degrees. Combined, they form the celestial circle of 365¼ degrees. Each degree measures 2,933 *li*, divided into twelve stations.\n\nThe *fenye* divisions of the seven lodges:\nFrom eleven degrees of *Dou* to seven degrees of *Nü* (also called *Xunü*) is the station *Xingji*. The celestial branch is *Chou*, called *Chifenif*, corresponding to the pitch *Huangzhong*. *Dou* points to *Zi*—this is the division of present-day Wu and Yue.\nFrom eight degrees of *Nü* to sixteen degrees of *Wei* is the station *Xuangan* (also called *Tiandian*). The celestial branch is *Zi*, called *Kundun*, corresponding to the pitch *Dalü*. *Dou* points to *Chou*—this is the division of present-day Qi.\nFrom seventeen degrees of *Wei* to four degrees of *Kui* is the station *Shiwei* (also called *Zouzi*). The celestial branch is *Hai*, called *Dayuanxian*, corresponding to the pitch *Taicou*.\n\nFrom the fifth degree of *Kui* to the sixth degree of *Wei* is the station *Jianglou*. The celestial branch is *Xu*, called *Kuomao*, corresponding to the pitch *Jiazhong*. *Dou* points to *Yin*—this is the division of present-day Wei.\n\nFrom the seventh degree of *Wei* to the eleventh degree of *Bi* is the station *Daliang*. The celestial branch is *You*, called *Zuoe*, corresponding to the pitch *Guxi*. *Dou* points to *Chen*—this is the division of Zhao.\n\nFrom the twelfth degree of *Bi* to the fifteenth degree of *Dongjing* is the station *Shichen*. The celestial branch is *Shen*, called *Huotan*, corresponding to the pitch *Zhonglü*. *Dou* points to *Si*—this is the division of Jin and Wei.\n\nFrom the sixteenth degree of *Jing* to the eighth degree of *Liu* is the station *Chunshou*. The celestial branch is *Wei*, called *Hongqia*, corresponding to the pitch *Rui Bin*. *Dou* points to *Wu*—this is the division of Qin.\n\nFrom the ninth degree of *Liu* to the seventeenth degree of *Zhang* is the station *Chunhuo*. The celestial branch is *Wu*, called *Dunpang* (also named *Dalü*). In terms of pitch, this corresponds to *Linzhong*. *Dou* points to *Wei*—this is the division of Zhou.\n\nFrom the eighteenth degree of *Zhang* to the eleventh degree of *Jiao* is the station *Chunwei*. The celestial branch is *Si*, called *Dahuangluo*, corresponding to the pitch *Yize*. *Dou* points to *Shen*—this is the division of Chu.\n\nFrom the twelfth degree of *Jiao* to the fourth degree of *Di* is the station *Shouxing*. The celestial branch is *Chen*, called *Zhixu*, corresponding to the pitch *Nanlü*. *Dou* points to *You*—this is the division of Han.\n\nFrom the fifth degree of *Di* to the ninth degree of *Wei* is the station *Dahuo*. The celestial branch is *Mao*, called *Danban*, corresponding to the pitch *Wuyi*. *Dou* points to *Xu*—this is the division of Song.\n\nFrom the tenth degree of *Wei* to the tenth degree of *Dou*, comprising 135 divisions, concludes the station *Ximu*. The celestial branch is *Yin*, called *Shetige*, corresponding to the pitch *Yingzhong*. *Dou* points to *Hai*—this is the division of present-day Yan.\n\nI humbly note: The Minister of Agriculture, Master Zheng, stated: \"Heaven has twelve stations, where the sun and moon are entwined. Earth has twelve divisions, where kings and lords establish their domains.\" Thus, the twenty-eight lodges are allocated to the twelve celestial branches, interwoven with the seven luminaries. One moves left, the other right, forming the warp and weft. This duality of the Five Phases completes the creation of heaven, earth, and the four seasons.\n\nThe Eastern Palace, the Azure Dragon, begins with *Jiao* as the court of the Five Emperors. The first lodge is the ancestral temple, *Di* is the root of heaven, *Fang* is the celestial palace, *Xin* is the Hall of Light, *Wei* is the filial son, and *Ji* is the guest. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The Azure Dragon coils on the left.\" The left is the Green Dragon, belonging to Wood and residing in the East. Further divided into lesser images: in the *Seven Stars* system, *Jiao* of Wood is the *Jiao* dragon, *Kang* of Metal is the dragon, *Di* of Earth is the *Mo*, *Fang* of the Sun is the hare, *Xin* of the Moon is the fox, *Wei* of Fire is the tiger, and *Ji* of Water is the leopard. The sun and moon reside within, while the five planets weave without. *Ximu* converges at *Yin*, *Dahuo* at *Mao*, and *Shouxing* at *Chen*.\n\n*Jiao*: Two stars, serving as the Celestial Gate. Between them lies the Gate of Heaven, within which is the Celestial Court. The ecliptic passes through its midst, where the seven luminaries traverse. The left horn of the dragon is the Celestial Field, governing law and punishment. The right horn is the general, commanding the army. When the stars are bright and large, the king’s Way flourishes, and the worthy hold court. If *Yinghuo* (Mars) trespasses the Celestial Field, drought ensues. As recorded in the *Treatise on Sacrifices*: \"The Han founder established the shrine of the Spirit Star.\"\n\n*Kang*: Four stars, the inner court of the Son of Heaven. It serves as the ancestral temple, governing epidemics and overseeing all memorials, lawsuits, trials, and the recording of merits. *Di*: Four stars, the lodging of the king and the palace of the queen and consorts. The two front stars are the primary wives, the two rear stars the concubines. The *Shanzi* states: \"When the Root of Heaven appears, the waters dry up.\" The *Erya* says: \"*Di* is the Root of Heaven.\" Below *Jiao* and *Kang*, it connects to the people like the root of a tree. This is the division of Song.\n\n*Fang*...\n\n**Fang**: Four stars, the Hall of Light, the office from which the Son of Heaven promulgates governance. The central space is the Celestial Thoroughfare; when the Seven Luminaries pass through it, the Son of Heaven is at peace. It is also the Celestial Steed and Heavenly Horses, governing chariots and carriages. The *Guoyu* states: \"The Agricultural Auspice.\" At dawn, when the sun and moon align with the Celestial Temple, the earth begins to stir. The *Sui Treatise* says: \"When the Five Weft Stars enter Fang, the rise of King Wen of Zhou commences.\"\n\n**Xin**: Three stars, the true seat of the Celestial King. The central star is the Hall of Light, where the Son of Heaven, as the Great Star, administers rewards and punishments. The front star is the Crown Prince, the rear star the lesser sons. The Great Fire is the Great Star; only when the great cold and heat recede does it retreat. The *Treatise on Pitch Pipes* says: \"Xin signifies the flowering of the myriad things.\" The *Tang Treatise* states: \"In the *Book of Changes*, 'Thunder follows Qian' is called *Great Strength*, symbolized by Fang.\" Xin is the essence of Qian, just as Fang is the ascending yang steed. Fang is where the sun and moon reside. The *Divine Mandate in Sequence* says: \"When Jupiter guards Xin, the year’s grain is abundant.\" The *Hongfan* states: \"Zhonghua refers to Jupiter in Xin.\" Jupiter is also called *Sheti* and *Zhonghua*. The *Zuozhuan* says: \"Xin is Fire.\" In the fifth month, fire first appears at dusk. The *Book of Songs* says: \"Three stars are in the heavens.\"\n\n**Wei**: The first of nine stars in Wei is the Empress; the next three stars are the consorts, and the following star represents the secondary concubines. The adjacent star is called the Divine Palace. The tail of the Azure Dragon represents the nine sons, their colors uniform and bright. When the rear palace is harmonious, there are many descendants. On *bingzi* and *chen* days, the Dragon’s Tail lies hidden to the left of *chen*. Wei signifies the life and death of the myriad things, like a tail.\n\n**Ji**: Four stars, the rear palace and the residence of the Empress and consorts. It is also the Dragon’s Tail, the Guest of Ceremony, governing speech and disputes. It is also called the Celestial Ford, ruling the Eight Winds. When the sun and moon lodge in Ji, they are northeast of the Eastern Wall. The *Yi* and *Si* winds arise above, and the Quail constellation follows. It is also said: \"Fu Yue rides the tail of Ji, ranked among the stars.\" The *Jin Treatise* states: \"Fu Yue is one star behind Wei.\" The *Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs* says: \"Ji is in the south and the Dipper in the north, hence 'Southern Ji, Northern Dipper.'\" I have once compared the hexagrams: the dragon belongs to the east, to *Zhen*. *Zhen* moves beneath the heavy yin, like a tortoise exhaling qi. The serpent rises—none are as adept at transformation as the dragon. The hexagrams align after the Spring Equinox, when *chen* is the station of the Azure Dragon. Movement brings change, so the dragon ascends at the Spring Equinox, rising as thunder, bursting forth from the earth. At the Autumn Equinox, it descends into the Thunder Marsh, embodying the image of *Guimei*. In midsummer, fierce thunder uproots trees and the dragon ascends. *Zhen* Wood occupies the position of *mao*. *Kang* is called the Dragon, akin to thunder. In the profound, the third in sequence is the dragon. Diviners take *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, and *mao* as the dragon. In celestial patterns, *Jiao* is the flood dragon, *Kang* the dragon, and *Yi* the earthworm. *Jiao* and *Kang* are *chen*; *Yi* is *si*. From the Spring Equinox to the Grain in Ear, *Zhen* governs, and *chen* and *si* are called *Yi*: the dispersal of qi. Fang is the Celestial Steed and the station of the Azure Dragon, hence horses are also called dragon-horses. The *Treatise* says: \"When the Five Weft Stars enter Fang, the rise of King Wen of Zhou begins\"—this too is an auspicious omen of a rising king. The saying that five horses transform into a dragon also originates here. Its symbols—the Celestial Field, the Agricultural Auspice, and many sons—all correspond to the spring of the east.\n\nThe Western Palace’s *Xianchi*:\n- **Kui** is the Ditch and Dike.\n- **Lou** is the Gathering Spring.\n- **Wei** is the Celestial Granary.\n- **Mao** is the White Robe.\n- **Bi** and **Hui** are the Frontier Troops.\n- **Zi** and **Nao** are the Tiger’s Head.\n- **Shen** is the Reaping.\n\nThe *Ling Xian* says: \"The White Tiger fiercely occupies the right.\" The White Tiger, belonging to Metal, resides in the west and is further divided into lesser images. The Seven Stars of the household:\n- **Kui Wood** is the Wolf.\n- **Lou Metal** is the Dog.\n- **Wei Earth** is the Pheasant.\n- **Mao Sun** is the Rooster.\n- **Bi Moon** is the Crow.\n- **Zi Fire** is the Monkey.\n- **Shen Water** is the Ape.\n\nThe sun and moon dwell at the center, the Five Stars weave outside. *Jiang Lou* meets *xu*, *Da Liang* meets *you*, and *Shi Shen* meets *shen*.\n\n**Kui**: Sixteen stars, the Celestial Armory. Also called the Celestial Boar or the Sealed Boar. It governs military affairs and suppresses violence, as well as canals and ditches. The *Monthly Ordinances* state: \"In the second spring month, the moon is in Kui; in late summer, Kui culminates at dawn.\"\n\n**Lou**: Three stars, the Celestial Prince, governing parks, livestock, and sacrificial offerings for suburban rites and grand feasts. When bright, the realm is at peace. The *Tang Treatise* says: \"When the sun meets Lou, great ministers are in distress.\"\n\n**Wei**: Three stars, the Celestial Kitchen, the granary of the Five Grains. When active, there are matters of transport; when bright, the realm is at peace. In late spring, the sun is in Wei.\n\n**Mao**: Seven stars, the Celestial Ear, governing judicial affairs in the west. Also the Hairy-Headed Hu Star; when bright, the realm’s prisons are just. The *Book of Documents* says: \"The day is short at the Mao star.\"\n\n**Bi**: Eight stars, the Net of Bi governs frontier troops, hunting, and distant military campaigns. The Yellow Road passes through it; when the Son of Heaven travels, he raises the banner. The Net of Bi leads the way—this is its significance.\n\n**The *Justice* states:** The preferences of the *Ji* and *Bi* constellations align with those of their consorts. The central earth-*qi* generates wind, while the eastern wood-*qi* generates rain. Wood overcomes earth as a consort, thus the *Ji* star favors wind—this is what its consort prefers. *Bi* belongs to the western quadrant, where metal-*qi* is yin; overcoming eastern wood as a consort, it thus favors rain and aligns with the preferences of its wife.\n\nMoreover, *Shen* and *Yin* oppose each other in mutual clash: when *Shen* is broken, it counters *Yin*; when *Yin* is countered, it becomes a howling gale. When *Yin* breaks *Shen*, *Shen* is countered, and violent rains arise.\n\n**Zi**: Three stars, the Tiger’s Head, the hidden treasury of the Three Armies. When bright, military provisions are abundant, and the general’s authority is secure. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"In mid-autumn, *Zi* culminates at dawn.\"\n\n**Shen**: Ten stars. Also called *Shenfa*, *Great Constellation*, *Celestial Market*, or *Iron Blade*. It governs execution, slaughter, and military campaigns. It is also the Balance, ensuring justice and equilibrium, and oversees frontier cities. The ten stars of *Shen* form the body of the White Tiger. The three central stars in horizontal alignment are the Three Generals. The three slanted stars below are called *Fa*, the Celestial Commandant, ruling over the Hu, Xianbei, Rong, and Di states—thus they must not shine brightly. The four outer stars are the shoulders and thighs: the northeast is the Left Shoulder, governing the Left General; the northwest is the Right Shoulder, governing the Right General; the southeast is the Left Foot, governing the Rear General; the southwest is the Right Foot, governing the Deputy General. Thus the *Yellow Emperor’s Divination* says: \"*Shen* corresponds to seven generals; if all seven are bright, and the *Star of Punitive Expeditions* shines as brilliantly as *Shen*, great ministers will conspire to raise arms.\"\n\n*Shen* is the third of the White Tiger. *Fang* is the Celestial Steed, also the second mansion of the Azure Dragon—hence horses are also called \"dragon-horses.\" The *Treatise* states: \"When the five planets enter *Fang*, it portends the rise of a king who will expand the frontiers—this is an auspicious omen of a flourishing dynasty.\" The saying that \"five horses transform into a dragon\" also originates from this. Its symbols include the *Celestial Field*, the *Agricultural Auspice*, and *Abundant Offspring*, all corresponding to the spring of the eastern quadrant.\n\nIn the Western Palace, *Xianchi* is the *Pool of Harmony*; *Kui* governs canals and ditches; *Lou* governs the gathering of springs; *Wei* is the *Celestial Granary*; *Mao* is the *White Garment*; *Bi* commands frontier troops; *Zi* is the *Tiger’s Head*; and *Shen* governs reaping and execution.\n\nThe *Spiritual Constitution* says: \"The White Tiger fiercely crouches on the right.\" The White Tiger, belonging to metal, resides in the west and is further divided into lesser symbols: the seven stars of *Kui* are the Wolf (Wood); *Lou* is the Dog (Metal); *Wei* is the Pheasant (Earth); *Mao* is the Rooster (Sun); *Bi* is the Crow (Moon); *Zi* is the Monkey (Fire); and *Shen* is the Ape (Water). The sun and moon dwell at the center, while the five planets weave their paths beyond. *Jianglou* meets *Xu*; *Daliang* meets *You*; and *Shichen* meets *Shen*.\n\n**Kui**: Sixteen stars, the Celestial Armory. Also called the *Celestial Boar* or *Sealed Boar*. It governs military affairs and suppresses violence, as well as canals and waterways. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"In mid-spring, the sun is in *Kui*; in late summer, *Kui* culminates at dawn.\"\n\n**Lou**: Three stars, the Celestial Son, governing imperial parks, sacrificial animals, and offerings for suburban rites and grand feasts. When bright, the realm is at peace, and descendants are numerous. The *Tang Treatise* says: \"When the sun meets *Lou*, great ministers are in distress.\"\n\n**Wei**: Three stars, the Celestial Kitchen, the granary of the Five Grains. When active, there are matters of transport; when bright, the realm is at peace. In late spring, the sun is in *Wei*.\n\n**Mao**: Seven stars, the Celestial Ear, governing judicial affairs in the west. Also the Hairy-Headed Hu Star; when bright, the realm’s prisons are just. The *Book of Documents* says: \"The day is short at the *Mao* star.\"\n\n**Bi**: Eight stars, the Net of *Bi* governs frontier troops, hunting, and distant military campaigns. The Yellow Road passes through it; when the Son of Heaven travels, he raises the banner. The Net of *Bi* leads the way—this is its significance.\n\nThe *Justice* states: The *Ji* and *Bi* constellations favor the preferences of wives. The central earth *qi* manifests as wind, while the eastern wood *qi* manifests as rain. Wood overcomes earth to become the consort, thus the *Ji* star favors wind—this is aligning with the consort’s preference. *Bi* belongs to the western quadrant, where metal *qi* is yin; overcoming eastern wood to become the consort, it thus favors rain and aligns with the wife’s preference. Moreover, *Shen* and *Yin* clash in opposition: when *Shen* breaks *Yin*, it comes in reverse, and *Yin* being reversed produces whirlwinds; when *Yin* breaks *Shen*, *Shen* being reversed produces violent storms.\n\n**Zi**: Three stars, the Tiger’s Head, serving as the hidden treasury for the Three Armies’ scouts. When bright, military provisions are abundant, and the general’s authority is secure. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"In mid-autumn, at dawn, *Zi* culminates.\"\n\n**Shen**: Ten stars: also called *Shenfa*, *Da Chen*, *Tian Shi*, or *Tiefan*. It governs execution, slaughter, and military campaigns. It also serves as the balance scale, ensuring fairness and order, and oversees frontier cities. The ten stars of *Shen* form the body of the White Tiger. The three central stars arranged horizontally represent the Three Generals. The three slanted stars below are called *Fa*, the Celestial Commandant, governing the Hu, Xianbei, Rong, and Di states—thus they should not shine brightly. The four outer stars are the left and right shoulders and thighs. The northeast is the Left Shoulder, governing the Left General; the northwest is the Right Shoulder, governing the Right General; the southeast is the Left Foot, governing the Rear General; the southwest is the Right Foot, governing the Deputy General. Thus the Yellow Emperor’s divination states: \"*Shen* corresponds to the Seven Generals; when all seven are bright, and the *Fa* star shines equally with *Shen*, great ministers plot rebellion.\" *Shen* as the White Tiger’s three stars includes one called the Balance. To the west lie nine curved stars: the first is *Tianqi*, the second *Tianyuan*, and the third *Jiuyou*. To the east is a great star called *Lang* (Wolf). When the Wolf’s horn changes color, banditry abounds.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the *Book of Changes* associates *Shen*’s tiger with the western quadrant, residing in *Dui*. *Dui*’s metal embodies the *qi* of contraction, severity, and killing, bearing the likeness of a tiger. The *Lü* hexagram speaks of \"treading on a tiger’s tail\"—its inner trigram is *Dui*. The *Ge* hexagram speaks of \"the tiger’s transformation\"—its outer trigram is *Dui*. The *Yi* hexagram speaks of \"the tiger’s gaze, fixed and fierce\"—it contains a hidden *Dui*. The *Image* states: \"*Shen* is the White Tiger\"—*Shen* is *Shen* (the zodiacal sign). *Shen* occupies the Tiger’s head, wielding the power of execution and slaughter. To the east lies the Great Wolf, and the wolf is also of the tiger kind—thus it is considered a celestial general star. Among the Seven Mansions, some correspond to the Armory or Celestial Granary, aligning with the autumn of gathering and contraction.\n\nIn the Southern Palace, the Vermilion Bird: *Jing* governs water affairs, *Gui* governs sacrificial rites, *Liu* is the Bird, governing plants and trees, *Xing* is the Great Fire, governing urgent matters, *Zhang* is the Plain Kitchen, governing feasts and guests, *Yi* is the Wings, governing distant guests, and *Zhen* is the Chariot, governing wind.\n\nThe *Spiritual Constitution* states: \"The Vermilion Bird spreads its wings in the front.\" The front is the Vermilion Bird, belonging to fire and residing in the south. Further subdividing its minor images: among the Seven Stars’ household, *Jing*’s wood is the *Jie* (reed), *Gui*’s metal is the sheep, *Liu*’s earth is the river deer, *Xing*’s sun is the horse, *Zhang*’s moon is the deer, and *Yi*’s fire is the sun. In late autumn, at dawn, *Liu* culminates. The sun and moon reside in the center, the Five Planets weave externally, the Quail’s Tail meets *Si*, the Quail’s Fire meets *Wu*, and the Quail’s Head meets *Wei*.\n\n**Jing**: Eight stars, the Celestial Watchtower, governing waterways and legal standards for fairness. The *Justice* states: \"East of *Shen* lies the King’s Well.\" Thus it is said: \"When the Eastern Well’s Dragon King upholds the law with fairness, the Well stars shine brightly and align properly, governing the capital’s jurisdiction.\" It is also said: \"When *Yinghuo* (Mars) trespasses the Eastern Well, drought follows.\"\n\n**Gui**: Five stars, the Celestial Eye, governing keen insight and the detection of treachery. When bright, the Five Grains flourish. It is also said to govern death and mourning.\n\n**Liu**: Eight stars, the Celestial Steward, governing imperial cuisine and the discernment of flavors. It also governs thunder and rain, being the Vermilion Bird’s beak—thus it is called the Bird’s Peck. The *Erya* states: \"The *Wei* (flavor) is called *Liu* (willow), which is the beak.\" It is also written as *Zhou* (啄, peck). The *Zuozhuan* states: \"*Wei* is the Great Fire.\" The *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"It is the Bird’s Beak, governing plants and trees.\" Moreover, in late summer, the sun resides in *Liu*; in late autumn, at dawn, *Liu* culminates.\n\n**Xing**: Seven stars, also called the Celestial Capital, governing garments and embroidered patterns. The seven stars also form the neck.\n\n**Zhang**: Six stars, the Plain Kitchen, the bird’s feeding ground, governing treasures and ancestral temple offerings. It oversees imperial banquets, rewards, and punishments—when bright, the kingly Way prospers. The *Han Records* state: \"It governs feasts and guests.\" The *Jin Records* state: \"*Zhu Zhang* is the Crow Star, thus it governs insects.\"\n\n**Yi**: Twenty-two stars, the Celestial Music Bureau, governing entertainers and distant guests from the barbarian lands beyond the seas. When bright, grand rituals and music flourish; when active, envoys from the Four Barbarians arrive, or the Son of Heaven mobilizes troops. *Yi* governs feathers and elegance, overseeing distant matters.\n\n**Zhen**: Four stars, the Chariot, governing cavalry and carriages, as well as burdens and tasks. When armies march or return, divination is performed at the *Jiao* (linchpin). It also governs the Prime Minister and assisting ministers, and is called the Bird’s Tail. It further governs wind, sharing the same position as *Xun*. Another name is *Yi* (轶), the head.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the *Book of Changes* associates *Li* with the southern quadrant, forming the image of the Flying Bird—the Vermilion Bird. The histories speak of \"flowing fire as the bird\" and \"the crow in the sun.\" *Wu* is the Quail’s Fire, *Wei* is the Quail’s Head, and *Si* is the Quail’s Tail. Its flavor resides in *Liu*, and its wings in *Yi*. *Liu* is *Wu* (the zodiacal sign), *Li*; *Yi* is *Si*, *Xun*. Fu Chuqiu, in his commentary on the *Mingyi* hexagram’s *Modesty*, states: \"The arriving bird is the Vermilion Bird.\" The *Gui Cang*’s initial *Xun* states: \"A bird will come, drooping its wings.\" *Yi* is the Quail’s Tail, hence it is called the Flying Bird. Birds of the quail and pheasant kind, such as the peacock of Lingnan, cling to the grass when they fly.\n\nThe Seven Stars form the Horse, corresponding to *chen* (the fifth earthly branch) as *wu* (noon), thus the Horse belongs to fire. Domestic animals born under *wu* are of the fire phase, and the silkworm is the Horse’s head—the essence of the Dragon Star. Therefore, horses and silkworms share the same *qi*, just as crabs, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles all bear yellow markings, which pertain to *Li* (fire). Among the Seven Mansions, there is the Ghost Chariot. The Seven Stars of the Celestial Eye govern embroidery and patterned fabrics, all corresponding to the image of *Li* in the southern quadrant, radiant and luminous.\n\nThe Northern Palace’s Dark Warrior (*Xuanwu*) has the Southern Dipper as its temple, the Oxherd as its sacrificial offering, and the Weaving Maiden as the Celestial Granddaughter. The Girl (of the *Xu* mansion) governs matters of weeping and lamentation, *Wei* (the Rooftop) governs roofing, the Encampment governs the ancestral temple, and the Eastern Wall governs literature and scholarship. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The sacred turtle coils its head behind, and what lies behind is *Xuanwu*, which belongs to water and resides in the north.\" Further subdivisions of the constellations include: in the Seven Stars mansion, *Doumu* is the cricket; *Niuxin* is the ox; *Nü* is the bat; *Xu* is the rat; *Wei* is the swallow; and *Yingshi* is the wall lizard.\n\nThe sun and moon reside at the center, while the five planets weave their paths beyond. *Xuanleng* converges at *zi* (midnight), *Xingji* at *chou* (the ox), and *Zouzi* at *hai* (the pig). The Southern Dipper consists of six stars, the Celestial Temple, and also marks the span of longevity. It further represents the positions of the Prime Minister and Grand Steward, governing rewards, promotions, the advancement of the worthy, and the bestowal of ranks and emoluments. It also commands military affairs. The two southern stars are the Celestial Beam, the two central stars the Celestial Minister, and the two northern stars the Celestial Treasury. When the stars of the Dipper shine brightly, the king’s Way is harmonious and peaceful. As the tradition states: \"When the *chen* (celestial stem) aligns with the Dipper’s handle, the sun and moon meet at the Southern Dipper.\"\n\nThe Ox consists of six stars, the Celestial Pass and Bridge, governing sacrificial affairs. The *Hou Zhi* states: \"The movement of the seven luminaries begins with the Oxherd.\" These three stars are the River Drum, also called the Oxherd. The *Lü Shu* says of the Oxherd: \"Yang *qi* moves, and the myriad things emerge.\" The *Bo Wu Zhi* records: \"Zhang Qian rode a raft to explore the source of the Yellow River.\" Yan Junping divined that a guest star trespassed upon the Ox and Dipper. It is also said: \"When Venus invades the Oxherd, the general meets with misfortune.\"\n\nThe Maid consists of four stars, also called the Bearded Maiden, governing cloth, silk, tailoring, and marriage. *Xu* is the term for a lowly concubine, the most humble of women’s duties. To its north lies the Weaving Maiden, the Celestial Granddaughter. The Void governs the northern settlements, the ancestral temple, and matters of sacrificial prayers and invocations. It also governs weeping and lamentation, as well as the office of the Chief Minister. The *Book of Documents* states: \"At the first watch, the star *Xu* culminates.\" The Rooftop consists of three stars governing the Celestial Treasury and Celestial Market, with *Wei* as the Black Ridgepole—a spirit of depletion, as is the Void.\n\nThe Encampment consists of two stars, the palace of the Son of Heaven. It also serves as the granary for military provisions and governs earthworks. When its stars shine brightly, the nation prospers. One name for it is the Dark Palace, another the Pure Temple. The two stars of the Encampment are called *Ding* (Stability). *Ding* means \"correct,\" governing earthworks. The *Book of Songs* says: \"*Ding* is rightly in the center.\" The Eastern Wall consists of two stars governing literature and the secret treasury of the world’s books. The *Commentary on the Book of Songs* states: \"The Wall is the outer courtyard of the Encampment.\" When the Winnowing Basket is in the south, the Wall lies to the east of the Encampment, hence it is called the Eastern Wall. When its stars shine brightly, the king’s rule flourishes, the Way of the state is luminous, and the land abounds with noble men. If Jupiter guards it, the five grains suffer damage from water. The *Monthly Ordinances* state: \"In mid-winter, the Eastern Wall culminates at dusk.\"\n\nComparing this with the *Book of Changes*, the Dipper originally belongs to the north as *Kan* (Water), and the Northern Palace’s turtle shape is its fundamental image. It is further divided into two creatures, the turtle and the snake, within the treasure, with *Kan* as the fox. Yu Fan takes *Gen* (the mountain) as the fox, while the *Tian Wen* takes the Heart as the fox—these interpretations diverge. The *Yun Dou Shu* states: \"The Jade Pivot scatters to become the rat.\" The Jade Pivot is the star of the Dipper, also belonging to *Kan*. The Oxherd lies in *chou* (the ox), its northern star the River Drum, also called the Oxherd. It signifies the movement of yang *qi* and the emergence of the myriad things. The four stars of the Bearded Maiden are base, while the three stars of the Weaving Maiden are noble—the concubine and the Celestial Granddaughter belong to different ranks.\n\nThe Celestial Prison consists of six stars beneath the Dipper’s bowl, the prison of the noble. The Chain of Nine Stars lies before the Summoning Star, the prison of the common people. Among the seven northern mansions, many pertain to ancestral temples and sacrificial prayers, for the north is the dark and hidden realm, the dwelling place of ghosts and spirits. The governance of palaces, women’s work, and the correspondence to winter’s season reflect the extreme of yin giving rise to yang, which is why the constellations all begin with the Oxherd’s inception.\n\nThe Central Palace’s Celestial Pole consists of five stars, and the Curved Array of six stars, all residing within the Purple Palace as the most exalted. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The Yellow Spirit, Xuanyuan, resides at the center.\" The fifth of the ten celestial stems, *wu* and *ji*, belongs to earth and corresponds to the five stars of the Celestial Pole. The sixth of the twelve earthly branches, *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, belongs to earth and corresponds to the six stars of the Curved Array. In heaven, it is the celestial stem; on earth, it is soil, which is why Master Zhang refers to it as the Yellow Spirit. Its days are the five offices, five times seven making thirty-five.\n\nThe names derive from the seven stars of the Northern Dipper as the Emperor’s Chariot, which steers the revolutions of creation. The five stars of the Celestial Pole—astrologers speak of the Four Emperors flanking the Yellow Emperor’s central seat: the Eastern Emperor, *Weilingyang*; the Southern Emperor, *Chipi’ao*; the Western Emperor, *Zizhaoqu*#18; and the Northern Emperor, *Xuguangji*. These correspond to the *Monthly Ordinances*’ wood, fire, metal, and water, with central earth making five. Some ask: \"Heaven is one, yet there are five emperors—why?\" The answer is: This merely borrows the names of rulers to describe the *qi* of the five phases, each with its own governance.\n\nThe Curved Array consists of six stars, an earthly image, for the number of *kun* (earth) is six. The single star in its mouth is called the Heavenly August Emperor, governing the numinous. The four stars embracing the Pole’s pivot are called the Four Assistants. The *Sui Zhi* states: \"They reside within the Purple Tenuity Palace.\" Ban Gu says: \"The Zhou dynasty took the position of the Curved Array, for earth resides at the center of the five phases, and the *qi* of the four seasons is complete within it. The Curved Array dwells amid the Dragon, Tiger, Quail, and Turtle, and thus governs creatures of fur, feathers, scales, and shells from all four directions. Is this not why it serves as the guardian of the Central Palace?\" The *Ling Xian* states: \"In court, it resembles officials; in man, it resembles affairs.\"\n\nThe Three Terraces Six stars rise in pairs, called the Heavenly Pillars. In man, they are the Three Dukes; in heaven, they are the Three Terraces. The first two stars of Wenchang are the Upper Terrace, serving as the Controller of Destiny and governing longevity. The next two stars are the Middle Terrace, serving as the Controller of the Center and governing the imperial clan. The last two stars to the east are the Lower Terrace, serving as the Controller of Emoluments and governing the military.\n\nThey are also called the Heavenly Stairway, by which the Great One ascends and descends. Another name is the Grand Stairway. The upper star of the upper step is the Son of Heaven, and the lower star is the queen. The upper star of the middle step is the feudal lords, and the lower star is the ministers and grand masters. The upper star of the lower step is the scholar-officials, and the lower star is the common people.\n\nIt is also said: the Upper Terrace’s Controller of Destiny is the Grand Commandant, the Middle Terrace’s Controller of the Center is the Minister of Education, and the Lower Terrace’s Controller of Emoluments is the Minister of Works. When the colors of the Three Terraces are uniform, lord and minister are in harmony; when uneven, discord and perversity arise. When the Three Steps are level, yin and yang are harmonized, wind and rain are timely, the spirits of soil and grain receive their due, and the world enjoys great peace.\n\nThe Six Signs are the signs and proofs of the six stars. The Wenchang Constellation consists of six stars located before the Dipper’s *kui*. They are the Six Signs of Heaven, governing the gathering and reckoning of the heavenly Dao. The *Historical Records* states: \"The Dipper’s *kui* bears the two generals, and the three nobles assist.\" The Controller is the same as the Three Terraces’ Controller of the Center.\n\nThe Five Stars of the *Shangshu* serve as the Heavenly Throat and Tongue, measuring and harmonizing the primordial *qi*, regulating the four seasons, and bestowing unified governance upon the four seas to jointly rule the world.\n\nThe Four Stars of Shaowei occupy the position of the scholar-officials in the Supreme Subtlety. The first is called the Recluse, or sometimes the Erudite. The first star south of the office is the Recluse, the second is the Counselor, and the third is the Grand Master. When bright and yellow, worthy talent is promoted.\n\nThe Fifteen Stars of the Gentlemen-Officials lie northeast of the Imperial Throne, also called the Office of the Raven-Dependent Gentlemen. In the *Rites of Zhou*, they are the primary officers; in the Han, they are the Gentlemen of the Palace, the Dispersed Gentlemen, and the Gentlemen of Remonstrance—such are their duties.\n\nThe Star of Transmitted Sayings lies behind the Winnowing Basket and Tail, governing prayers and invocations, and is the office of shamans. I humbly suggest that one star corresponds to those in court, and the star preceding the office is the Grand Invocator. The Invocator is the shaman’s office.\n\nThus, the Three Terraces correspond to the Three Dukes, the six stars of Wenchang to the *Shangshu*, the six stars north of the Dipper to the Heavenly Throat and Tongue, and the *Shangshu* likewise to the king’s throat and tongue. Heaven has the Star of Transmitted Sayings, and man has the minister of transmitted sayings; heaven has Wang Liang driving the horses, and man has Wang Liang the skilled charioteer. Such parallels are too numerous to list exhaustively. The Literary Star...\n\nThe Eastern Wall: two stars, the celestial repository of the world’s literary arts and written works. When these stars shine brightly, the king’s Way prevails, and the land abounds with noble men.\n\nThe Five Planets Converging in Kui: see previous note on the Five Planets in Alignment.\n\nThe Chronicler at the Pillar: the easternmost star governs the recording of transgressions, bearing the likeness of the left-side historian.\n\nThe Six Jia: six stars beside the Canopy of Flowers, overseeing governance and instruction.\n\nThe Canopy of Flowers: it divides yin and yang, matches the seasons to their lords. The *Jin Treatise* states: above, nine stars form the canopy; below, nine stars form the handle of the canopy, which shelters the imperial throne. The *Book of Songs* says: “It makes its pattern in the heavens.”\n\nThe Weaving Girl: three stars, the Celestial Granddaughter, governing fruits, ferns, silk, precious treasures, and marriage rites. The *Book of Songs* says: “All day she moves seven times.” The Celestial Granddaughter weaves cloud-brocade robes.\n\nThe Martial Star: the Celestial General. Twelve stars north of Lou, governing military affairs. The central great star is the Celestial Grand Commander; the outer small stars are his officers and soldiers. When the Grand General trembles, armies rise and the great commander marches forth. When the small stars are incomplete, troops are not dispatched.\n\nThe Gentleman of the Court: one star, in the Gentleman’s Station, with the north as the armory.\n\nThe Cavalry Office: twenty-seven stars, in the region of Di. The southern stars represent the Son of Heaven; the Tiger Nobles govern the night watch.\n\nThe Tiger Warriors: one star, north of the Supreme Subtlety, the mounted guardsmen at the palace gate.\n\nThe Feathered Forest: forty-five stars, south of the Encampment, also called the Celestial Army.\n\nThe Ramparts: twelve stars, north of the Feathered Forest, the walls of the Feathered Forest. The positions of the Three Armies form the Encampment.\n\nThe Banner of Orion: nine stars, west of Shen. Also called the Celestial Banner, the bow. It governs the drawing of crossbows and watches for omens.\n\nThe Nine Pennants: nine stars to the southwest, the Son of Heaven’s banner.\n\nThe Left and Right Banners: nine stars each, north of Qianniu, the Celestial Drums. Also called the Three Martial Grand Generals, stationed between the left and right commanders. The nine stars beside the drums serve as standards. The River Drum stars are also called Qianniu—this is incorrect. The *Sui Treatise* states: the River Drum comprises three stars. The *Tang Astral Treatise* says: the River Drum is the symbol of the general.\n\nThe Celestial Lance: three stars, east of the Dipper’s handle, also called the Celestial Halberd, the celestial armory.\n\nThe Bow: nine stars, southeast of the Wolf, the Celestial Bow. It governs defense against bandits.\n\nThe Celestial Clubs: five stars, the Son of Heaven’s vanguard. They quell strife, repel adversity, and guard against the unforeseen. If one star is missing, the nation’s armies rise.\n\nThe Beckoning Star: one star, corresponding to the Dipper, through which the Hu receive the Mandate from the Central Kingdom. If it shines brightly but not upright, the Hu will not receive the Mandate.\n\nThe Celestial Stables: ten stars of the Eastern Wall, called the Celestial Trough. They govern the office of horses, post stations, and water clocks, running in tandem with sundials.\n\nWang Liang: the Celestial Team of Four, one star called Wang Liang, filling the fields with honored chariots and cavalry. The *Jin Treatise* states: Wang Liang is also called the Celestial Horse; Liang is also the Celestial Bridge. Thus, it may portend chariots and cavalry, or fords and bridges. I humbly say: the concurrent use of civil and martial arts is the Way of long endurance. Yet in the court, the Gentlemen of the Court number fifteen stars, while in the wilds, the Gentleman General is but one star—such is the celestial instruction to mankind.\n\nThe People’s Star: the Chamber Star as the Agricultural Auspice. Among the seven stars in the east, when the sun stands at midday on the day of the Beginning of Spring, the star is centered—this is the Agricultural Auspice. Its omen is the ripening of all grains.\n\nThe Agricultural Minister: southwest of the Southern Dipper, the Elder Farmer governs cultivation.\n\nThe Celestial Rooster: it heralds the seasons to hasten plowing.\n\nQianniu: Zhang Qian, riding a raft, saw the Cowherd plowing east of the river and the Weaving Girl weaving west of it. Though the tale is not attested, it benefits the world’s teachings—how much more so, as the Seven Luminaries rise in Qianniu. The Dao brings forth yang qi, as stated in the *Erya*. The River Drum and Qianniu are one star—so say Li Xun and Sun Yan. Li says: the name of the twenty-eight lunar lodgings; Sun says: the River Drum lies north of Qianniu.\n\nThe Plow’s Curve: nine stars. Six are large and bright; the remaining three are small and dim. When plowing, the handle points upward.\n\nThe Celestial Fields: nine stars, south of the Oxherd. Also said: the left horn of the Azure Dragon is the Celestial Fields.\n\nThe Water Office: southwest of the Eastern Well, governing the office of waters.\n\nThe Net Dam: nine stars east of Qianniu, damming floodwaters for irrigation.\n\nThe Four Rivers: the stars of the Jiang, the He, and the Ji.\n\nThe Dipper: five stars, south of the Palace, governing balanced measures. When it tilts upward, the world’s grain measures are uneven; when inverted, the year requires expiation.\n\nThe Inner Pestle and Mortar: seven stars governing the provision of military rations. If a guest star enters, war arises in the Eastern Prefecture. The southern three stars are the Inner Pestle; the four stars are the Inner Mortar.\n\nThe Celestial River: north of the Tail. If the four stars are incomplete or unsettled, great floods emerge.\n\nThe Celestial Boat: nine stars, also called the Chariot or the Accumulated Waters, used to ferry across impassable waters. The central star is called Accumulated Waters, for divining water disasters and governing floods and droughts. When evenly bright, the world is at peace.\n\nThe Celestial Coins: ten stars, resembling strung coins, located in the north, northwest of the Falling Gate.\n\nThe Celestial Lock: west of the Dipper’s handle, governing closure and sealing.\n\nThe Celestial Market Enclosure: According to the *Sui Treatise*, the enclosure comprises twenty-two stars, northeast of the Chamber, governing weights and measures and the gathering of crowds in markets. When the stars are numerous and radiant, the year is abundant; when sparse, the year is barren. If Mars lingers here, disloyal ministers are executed. If a comet or broom star lingers, markets are relocated and prefectures altered. The Emperor’s Seat: one star in the market’s center, the Celestial Court. When bright and lustrous, the Son of Heaven is auspicious, and his commands prevail. The Observer: one star northeast of the Emperor’s Seat, governing the surveillance of yin-yang and eunuchs. Four stars in the southwest—if not overly bright, then the assisting ministers are strong. As the *Yi* says: “At midday, there is a market; exchange and withdraw.” The people of the world follow this, as Shennong took from *Shi He* for this purpose.\n\nThe Human Stars: five southern stars called the Human Stars, governing tranquility and the harmony of the multitude near and far. Also called the Outer Stars, governing the prevention of licentiousness and dissipation.\n\nThe Old Man Star.\n\nThe South Pole Star appears at *bing* on the autumnal equinox and sets at *ding* on the vernal equinox. When visible, it heralds governance in peace and prosperity; when absent, it foretells the outbreak of war.\n\n**Celestial Nipple**\nOne star north of *Kang* is called the Celestial Nipple, governing sweet dew.\n\n**Gezai**\nIt resembles a flame of fire, yellow-white, rising from the earth, broad below and tapering above. When it appears, there will be harvests without plowing, yet great misfortune will follow if no earthworks are undertaken.\n\n**Auspicious Star**\nA star of virtue, also called the Celestial Gleam. It regularly emerges over states of the Dao, born at the dark and new moons, aiding the moon’s brightness. *Li* means radiance: a red directional *qi* connects with a green directional *qi*. Within the red *qi* are two yellow stars; within the green *qi* is one yellow star. These three stars together form the Auspicious Star.\n\n**Celestial Altar**\nSix stars south of *Yu Gui* are called the Celestial Altar. Its position is *kun*, its *qi* is *wei*, and its spirit is the son of Gonggong. Gou Long pacified water and earth, so sacrifices were made to his essence, which became a star.\n\n**Celestial Millet Star**\nFive stars south of the Seven Stars. Millet is the minister of agriculture, taking the chief of the five grains as its name.\n\n**Celestial Temple**\nFifteen stars south of *Zhang* are called the Celestial Temple, the ancestral temple of the Son of Heaven. *Xu* and *Wei* govern the *qi* of ancestral temples and descendants.\n\nI say: The merit of the people begins with Hou Ji. By exerting effort in agriculture to match Heaven, the Auspicious Star appears and sweet dew descends. The celestial signs are clear—how can this not be true?\n\nShaozi said: Stars belong to the day.\n*The Essential Meaning* states: Day and night divide the clepsydra’s marks.\nMa Shi said: Fifty marks for day, fifty for night, based on sunrise and sunset.\nCai Yong said: Stars appear at night. The three marks after sunset and before sunrise belong to the day. Thus, day has fifty-six marks, night forty-four.\nZheng said: The sun at midday is taken as the day; when visible, the clepsydra marks fifty-three, when not, forty-five—differing from Cai by one mark.\n\nI observe: Shaozi takes *li* as stars, stars as day, and *chen* as night. When the sun rises, stars fade; when the sun sets, stars emerge—this is plain to all. Thus, this defines day and night.\n\n**Celestial Changes**\nThe five planets move in degrees, intertwining with the seven luminaries. Distributed across the four directions, they proclaim fortune and misfortune. Thus it is said: When the constant order is disrupted, stars and planets move erratically.\n\nJupiter moves one-twelfth of a degree per day, completing a celestial cycle in twelve years.\nMars moves one-thirty-third of a degree per day, completing a cycle in thirty-three years.\nSaturn moves one-twenty-eighth of a degree per day, completing a cycle in twenty-eight years.\nVenus moves one-eighth of a degree per day, completing a cycle in eight years.\nMercury moves one degree per day, completing a cycle in one year.\n\nThese are the degrees traversed by the five planets, which together with the twenty-eight lodges form the celestial body. Any deviation brings floods and droughts in the heavens, calamities among people, and the rise and fall of states. If one cultivates virtue to avert them, one may yet escape harm. Otherwise, the accumulation of minute errors leads to great consequences—how can this not be feared?\n\nNow, the celestial changes are briefly outlined below.\n\n**Comet Changes**\n*The Gongyang Commentary* states: A star that trails at the Great Fire is a comet.\nHe Xiu said: It is the *qi* of disorder, symbolizing the sweeping away of the old and the establishment of the new.\nThe *Apocrypha* states: Its form is a *zhang* long, and comets have five colors.\nIf green, the feudal lords will be broken;\nif red, powerful states will act wantonly;\nif white, great wars will erupt.\n\nI have examined their changes in detail:\nIn the time of Duke Wen of Lu, a comet appeared in the Northern Dipper, and later Chu, as a barbarian, deeply invaded the Central States.\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Marquis of Qi performed a comet-averting ritual.\nYanzi said: It cannot be done. This is Heaven’s teaching to the people; the people will scatter and flee.\n\nDuring the fifteenth year of the First Emperor of Qin, comets appeared four times, some stretching across the sky. He then conquered the six states, repelled the four barbarians, and the dead piled like hemp.\nIn the fifth year of Emperor Wu’s *Yuanguang* reign (130 BCE), in the seventh month, a comet entered the Eastern Palace, reaching the favored ministers, and lingered for over fifty days—an omen of the eunuch Zhao Zhong’s treacherous disorder.\nIn the second year of Emperor Ai’s *Jianping* reign (5 BCE), in the third month, a comet emerged in *Qianniu* and remained for over seventy days, ultimately foreshadowing Wang Mang’s usurpation of the state.\n\nIn the *Jiazi* year of Emperor Lizong’s *Jingding* reign (1264), a comet appeared in *Liu* Lodge, with the pitch matching *Kuibin*, in the *Chunhuo* mansion. Its baleful flames stretched halfway across the sky for over seventy days.\nOnly the Secretariat Drafter again memorialized: The comet’s trespass on *Liu* Lodge is an extraordinary and ominous sign. The administrative path and the prison bureau—this is the star of the gate and its attendants. Now, with Kong Guang and Cui Lie transformed into a comet, the *Ganquan* method follows, and the stars of *Wenchang* and the Canopy are implicated. Now, with Yuan Ji and Gong Yu transformed into a comet, the stars of the Remonstrance Bureau and the Censorate are implicated. Now, with the phoenix’s song turning to the cicada’s chirp, and the steeds of the imperial stables fed with moss, they are transformed into a comet—yet there is an even greater comet. For Shang Yang’s ministerial achievements and emphasis on merit and profit, for Wang Anshi’s monopolization of power and claim that celestial changes are not to be feared—this cuts to the heart of the times’ maladies. Alas! The words were not heeded, and within a decade, the state perished. How lamentable!\n\n**Chi You’s Banner Changes**\nResembling a comet but curved like a banner, yellow above and white below, it is the essence of Mars. When seen, the Son of Heaven will campaign against the four directions.\n\n**Heavenly Dog Falling to Earth**\nIts form is like a great meteor, with a sound like thunder, its light resembling fire, blazing in the sky. When it falls to earth, it resembles a dog. Its base is round, like a field of several *qing*. Its top is sharp, and within a thousand *li*, armies are broken and generals slain.\nMeng said: It is also the essence of Venus.\n\nVenus’s passage across the sky has variations of excess and deficiency. Excess and deficiency mean: when the sun is in the south, Venus is in the south; when the sun is in the north, Venus is in the north. When in excess, feudal lords are unsettled; in warfare, advance is auspicious, retreat inauspicious.\n\nWhen the sun is in the south, Venus is in the north; when the sun is in the north, Venus is in the south. This is called \"deficiency.\" The lord and ruler will have worries; in warfare, retreat is auspicious, advance inauspicious.\n\nMoreover, when Venus is in the south and Jupiter in the north, it is called \"the male and female.\" The year’s grain will be abundant. If it should emerge but does not, or should enter but does not, it will not break the state but will cause its downfall.\n\nWhen Venus crosses the sky, it is the yang of the sun. When the sun rises, the stars vanish; if it appears at noon, it is called \"crossing the sky.\" Contending with the sun for brightness is called \"disordering the celestial order.\" The world will undergo revolution, the people will change rulers, and the populace will flee. The strong will weaken, the small will grow strong. The female ruler will prosper—Wang Mang, the Earthly Emperor—when Venus is in the Supreme Subtlety, illuminating the earth like moonlight. The Supreme Subtlety is the court of the Son of Heaven. In that year, great armies entered the Son of Heaven’s court, advancing to the Gradual Terrace, where Wang Mang’s head was struck off.\n\nI say: These two stars do not necessarily retreat far. In the autumn of the *gengwu* year, the Heavenly Dog star fell. Soon after, a great general was slain. In the summer of the *jichou* year, Venus crossed the sky. The following year, the White Wave Rebellion arose, along with the previous *jiazi* year’s three great comet-like omens. At seventy years of age, I witnessed all these with my own eyes, and so I record them here.\n\nVenus governs warfare; Mars governs internal strife. The moon governs punishment, and its changes have three forms. When these three lose their proper measure, there will be treacherous ministers and murderous subjects, with corpses and bloodshed in war.\n\nThe Crooked Arrow star’s omen: Nothing is straighter than an arrow, yet one who wields a crooked arrow is a wicked person. Formerly, when Xiang Yu rescued Julu, a crooked arrow flowed westward. He then buried the Qin soldiers alive and massacred Xianyang, using chaos to punish chaos.\n\nThe omen of stars gathering as portents: When water, wood, and fire combine in the Eastern Well, the prognostication says there will be external warfare and mourning. When the five planets enter the Ghost Cart, or when wood, fire, and metal combine, appearing like linked pearls in the Void, it signifies death and mourning. When three stars gather in the Dipper, generals and ministers will be executed. When fire, metal, and water combine in the *miao* asterism, or when metal and water combine in the Eastern Well, it signifies a gathering of white-clad mourners. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, the Son of Heaven wore white four times and visited the imperial residences—this was the omen. During the Tianbao era of Tang, the five planets gathered in the Winnowing Basket and Tail. The prognostication said: \"With virtue, there is celebration; without virtue, calamity.\" In the Zhide era, wood, fire, metal, and water gathered in the Quail’s Head, following Jupiter. Wood and fire, as yang, govern the central states; metal and water, as yin, govern the outer states. When yin and yang combine, the inner and outer states will be linked by warfare. From this, we see that the gathering of the five planets may be auspicious or inauspicious; one cannot be rigid.\n\nThe omen of meteors: During the Yuanyan era of Han, at the hour of *ru*, a meteor appeared with a head as large as a jar, over ten *zhang* long, red and white, descending from the sun toward the southeast. Some were as large as basins, others like chicken eggs, shining brightly like rain, falling until dusk. The prognostication was that the Son of Heaven would lose power, and later Wang Mang usurped the state. During the Jianwu era, over a hundred small meteors appeared, some moving from southwest to northeast in all directions. The prognostication was that the common people would flee, and later the rebellion of Gongsun Shu caused the people to scatter. A meteor as large as a cup moved westward from the Weaving Maiden; later, Empress Guanglie passed away. A meteor emerged from the Literary Prosperity asterism, its white light illuminating the earth for four *zhang*, swaying like a dragon or serpent. Soon after, Wang Shang took his own life.\n\nThe *Jin Treatise* says: It is the messenger of Heaven. Large stars are messengers of great matters; small stars, of minor matters. Those descending from above are called \"flowing\"; those ascending from below are called \"flying.\" Large ones are called \"rushing,\" which are also meteors. A rumbling sound is a sign of anger. Small meteors represent the common people. Those as large as the moon represent the ruler. When all stars shake, it is a sign of the people’s toil.\n\nThe Whispering Ear star’s omen: Beside the great star of the Western Net, a small star stirs and moves, indicating slanderous disorder at the ruler’s side.\n\nThe Celestial Slander star’s omen: It is also said that the six stars of the Curled Tongue in the north govern speech and discern flattery and slander. The star above the Curled Tongue is called the Celestial Slander.\n\nThe Ominous Spear and Withered Comet’s omen: Four stars of unusual form bring calamity—one state will be broken, and its ruler endangered. The remaining calamities will be drought, famine, and violent epidemics.\n\nMars’s essence as an omen: At the end of the Daye era of Sui, Mars moved retrograde into the Southern Dipper, its color red like blood, its rays flashing and shining seven or eight *chi* long. Later, Yang Xuangan rebelled, and the world fell into great chaos. During the Changshou era of Tang, Mars trespassed against the Five Feudal Lords. Hun Yi, the director of the armillary sphere, memorialized: \"My fate is in metal, and the Five Feudal Lords’ position is in fire. Fire overcomes metal; I will die.\" Empress Wu said: \"Let us perform exorcisms.\" She transferred him to the post of Director of the Waterways Bureau, where water generates metal, and also removed him from the position of Grand Astrologer. \"You need not worry.\" That autumn, Hun Yi died.\n\nVenus’s essence as an omen: The Six Bandit stars are the essence of Venus. They appear in the due south, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and red, shaped like a comet with nine rays. The Heavenly Dog is also Venus, governing warfare. The Amnesty star: A star over three *zhang* long appears south of the Dipper’s handle, extending to the Xuanyuan asterism before vanishing. The prognostication is that there will be an amnesty.\n\nSaturn’s essence as an omen: The Xianhan star is Saturn’s essence. It appears in the due north, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and red with a blue center, or blue with a red center. Below its tail, three comets lie horizontally; it is also called the Five Remnants. A star appearing in the due east, resembling the celestial timekeeper, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and yellow.\n\nThe Wolf’s Horn omen: East of the Nine Wandering stars is a great star called the Wolf. When its color changes, there will be many bandits. The Coiled Rope: It is the prison of the lowly. It is also called the Linked Rope. Linked to the Celestial Prison, it governs the suppression of violence. When all nine stars are bright, prisons will be crowded. When seven stars are bright, there will be a great amnesty. The Axe and Drill are in use. The Returning Evil omen: It is like a star but not a star, like a cloud but not a cloud. When the Returning Serpent appears, there will be one who returns to their state.\n\nIts omens may also be auspicious or inauspicious. The above is all recorded in the *Treatise on Astronomy*. Celestial changes correspond to the rise and fall of the times. Though stars are one in kind, their forms and colors, their constancy and mutations, their seasons and divisions—each has its own significance and interpretation. Their omens differ, yet only Yan Ziling was worthy of the omen of the visiting star, and only Chen Zhonggong could match the gathering of virtue-stars. Fu Yue was born when the asterism *Jiwei* hosted a guest star, and Zhuge Liang died when a star fell into the central encampment. Noble persons and gentlemen have never been unconnected to celestial phenomena.\n\nVisiting stars may also undergo transformations: when their form is as large as a melon and their color is greenish-white, they portend either great floods or severe famine. When a white *qi* arises in the southwest of *Tianyuan*, cattle and horses will perish or be injured—how inauspicious indeed! During the Spring and Autumn period, comets appeared three times. At night, the constant stars would vanish, and stars would fall like rain in the darkness. Thirty-six rulers were slain, twenty-five states perished, and lords fled in such numbers that they could not preserve their altars of soil and grain.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"When stars appear at night without clouds yet heaven weeps, what is the cause?\" It is because heaven cannot bear the inversion of the noble and the base, and grieves that the common people suffer such calamities. How could celestial signs be empty correspondences?\n\nThus, the recluses of ancient times who concealed their virtue would observe the heavens by night and examine human affairs by day, harboring hidden concerns. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The Way of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the modest; the Way of Earth alters the full and flows to the modest; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the modest; the Way of Man detests the full and favors the modest.\" Ouyang Zi said: \"This is the sage’s ultimate discourse on the relationship between heaven and man.\"\n\nThough the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records solar eclipses and celestial changes, Confucius never explained their causes, saying: \"The minds of heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits cannot be known; what can be known is only man.\" When the sun reaches its zenith, the bell tolls in reverse; prosperity and decline alternate. Heaven—I do not know it; I see only its waxing and waning in things. When plants and trees reach maturity, they wither and fall; when things are lowly, they advance and flow onward. Earth—I do not know it; I see only its transformations and flows in things. Those among men who are arrogant and excessive meet with misfortune, while those who are restrained and frugal enjoy good fortune. Ghosts and spirits—I do not know them; I see only the fortunes and misfortunes of men.\n\nSince the minds of heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits cannot be known, we infer them from their manifestations in things. Thus, we base our words on what is visible in their movements: we speak of waxing and waning, of transformation and flow, of fortune and misfortune. But for man, what can be known is straightforward—we speak directly of likes and dislikes. The known and the unknown are expressed in different terms, yet when weighed together, they differ not from man. Because they are unknowable, we should revere and keep them at a distance. Because they differ not from man, we need only cultivate our human affairs. Never has a man’s heart been content yet heaven’s intent angered; never has human principle been perverse yet the Way of Heaven been compliant.\n\nAlas! After the sages passed, heterodoxies arose. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, scholars have long been deluded by theories of calamities and anomalies. The doctrines of celestial patterns and the Five Phases have proliferated endlessly. My confusion cannot but differ from that of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Ouyang [Xiu] held that what is knowable in man is one, while the unknowable in heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits are three. When the one is exhausted, the three are contained within. How, then, should the noble person conduct themselves? Only by cultivating the self and awaiting destiny.\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Eight, concludes.\n\n#25 \"Water Palace\" (*Shuǐfǔ*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Water Palace Star\" (*Shuǐfǔ xīng*).\n#26 \"Net Weir\" (*Luóyàn*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Net Weir Star\" (*Luóyàn xīng*).\n#27 \"Four Waterways\" (*Sìdú*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Four Waterways Star\" (*Sìdú xīng*).\n#28 \"Dipper\" (*Dǒu*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Dipper Star\" (*Dǒu xīng*).\n#29 \"Palace\" (*Guān*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Palace\" (*Gōng*).\n#30 \"Auspicious\" (*Jí*), originally \"Ancient\" (*Gǔ*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#31 \"Dross\" (*Gézǐ*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Luminous Vapor\" (*Gézé*); \"Misfortune\" (*Jiù*), originally \"Guest\" (*Kè*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#32 \"Regret\" (*Xī*), originally \"Borrow\" (*Jiè*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#33 \"Qin\" (*Qín*), originally \"Offer\" (*Fèng*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#34 \"Five\" (*Wǔ*), originally \"King\" (*Wáng*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#35 \"Constrained\" (*Jū*), originally \"Dogwood\" (*Jǔ*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#36 \"Heaven\" (*Tiān*), originally \"Foot\" (*Chǐ*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n#37 \"Pierce\" (*Zuān*), in the *Siku Quanshu* edition: \"Gild\" (*Dù*).\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Nine.\nCompiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; collated by Fang Hui Wanli of Xugu.\n\n**Lesser Yin**\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke of Jin asked Bo Xia: \"What is meant by *chén*?\" He replied: \"*Chén* is the conjunction of the sun and moon. *Chén* is time.\" I humbly observe: From the eleventh month to the tenth month, from *zǐ* to *hài*, the sun and moon converge at fixed times, hence the term *chén*. In the heavens, this manifests as the twenty-eight constellations, visible to the eye, thus described in terms of stars. Yet their circulation through the four seasons and eight nodes is formless *qi*, dispersed across the great void—seemingly tangible yet intangible—all governed by *chén*.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Chén* are the stars in the sky, divided into twelve segments, which are the twelve *chén*, the celestial firmament. The sun, moon, and stars are four distinct entities. Here, *chén* refers to the degrees within each segment. For instance, when the sun and moon lodge in *Jiǎo* at a certain degree, that lodging place is *chén*. Thus it is said: 'The conjunction of the sun and moon is called *chén*.'\"\n\nMaster Wei of the Xiang clan said: \"If referring to the stellar bodies themselves, they are called *stars*. When the sun and moon meet at a star, it is named *constellation*, *chén*, *station*, *mansion*, or *conjunction*. If not based on their meeting with a constellation, then referring to the stellar bodies themselves, they are simply *stars*.\"\n\nThe *Essential Meaning of the Book of Documents* states: \"The celestial pole is called the Northern *Chén*; the five planets include the *Chén* star; there are also the twelve stations and the solar *chén*.\" It further says: \"*Chén* number twelve; the conjunction of the sun and moon is called *chén*. *Chén* is the body of Heaven, the *qi* of no-thing.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"*Chén* are the twelve counted from Earth. The *qi* of no-thing is invisible, yet it becomes manifest through the conjunction of the sun and moon. Because it is invisible, it is *yin*; the *yin* of Heaven is Heaven’s body, the foundation of Heaven’s existence. Counted from Earth, it is Heaven’s Earth.\"\n\nIt also says: \"The *yin* within *yin* is *chén*, the celestial firmament. *Qi* is one, yet its ruler is *qián*. *Chén* is the *qi* of no-thing, the body of Heaven. Thus it is called the celestial firmament, for *chén* is to Heaven as soil is to Earth. *Chén* is the body of Heaven; soil is the body of Earth. *Chén* is the *qi* of no-thing, invisible. Yet by observing the stars, we know its vast emptiness can contain all things. Soil is a tangible substance, visible. By observing mountains, we further know its capacity to bear all things. Soil is the great substance; *chén* is the great void. The sun, moon, and stars are lodged within it. Though *chén* is invisible, Heaven is ever visible day and night, hence the one that is not used is the one that is revered.\"\n\nIt further says: \"*Chén* reaching the sun is generation; the sun reaching *chén* is function. Following is generation, while reversing is function. *Chén* reaching the sun refers to Heaven’s leftward movement, which is harmonious, distributing *qi* to generate things. The sun reaching *chén* refers to the sun’s rightward movement, which is contrary, transforming *qi* to serve the seasons. Thus the seasons can be retroactively deduced, and things naturally come to fruition.\"\n\nMaster Zi Yun said: \"Patrolling the six *jiǎ*, encountering the Dipper—this speaks of the correspondence between Heaven and the sun.\" It also says: \"Stars are the surplus essence of the sun; *chén* are the surplus *qi* of the moon. The sun is the essence of *yang*, the spirit-soul of Heaven. The moon is the essence of *yin*, the *qi*-po of Heaven. Stars are the surplus essence of *yang*; *chén* are the surplus *qi* of *yin*. Thus stars are the spirits of Heaven, while *chén* are the body of Heaven. The sun and moon in the sky are like a person’s true heart and life-gate, the root of *yin* and *yang*. The five planets are like the five viscera; the myriad stars are like the limbs, bones, essence, and blood. *Chén* to Heaven is as the body and *po* are to humans.\"\n\nIt further says: \"Heaven has the sun, moon, stars, and *chén*, making five. Earth has the five phases—metal, wood, water, and fire—making five. *Chén*, the *yin* within *yang*, cannot change; thus a day has twelve *chén*, which are invisible. *Chén* is the body of Heaven. *Chén* to Heaven is as soil is to Earth. Heaven governs function—does it have spirit? *Chén* cannot exhaust Heaven, unlike soil, which exhausts Earth. Beyond *chén* is another name for Heaven; soil is what constitutes Earth.\"\n\nMaster Hanshang said: \"The moon is born from the sun’s illumination; the multitude of stars are bathed in its radiance, their light transformed by water. The Three Luminaries share the same form, *yin* and *yang* paired, their body being *chén*.\" It also says: \"Heaven transforms one into four. The four have form, while the one is formless.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"The sun, moon, and stars constitute Heaven’s body. The four completed form the body of the Great Ultimate, which retreats and hides among the four yet remains invisible. Thus the sun, moon, stars, and Heaven make five; without the sun, moon, and stars, there is no Heaven. The four have form, thus constituting shape. The one is formless, retreating into concealment. Speaking of five, it must return to Heaven; speaking of ten, it must return to Earth. Five corresponds to the Ultimate of Non-Being; ten corresponds to the Ultimate of Being. It may also be said: remove the one, and the four cease to exist.\"\n\nHeaven’s body numbers four, with one unused. The invisibility of Heaven’s *chén* arises because *chén* is Heaven’s body, hence unseen. Its color is deep blue; its form is vast and undifferentiated. Among the four, only the sun, moon, and stars are distinctly visible. Thus we know that among the five, one is retained as the body, hence four are used. Among the four, one is retained as the body, hence three are used. In this way, five becomes the formless one, exemplifying spontaneity. *Chén* is the unused one, exemplifying the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Great Mystery* uses one *yuan* to govern three directions, called Heaven, Earth, and Human—this conveys the same idea. One season consists of three months; one month consists of thirty days, both excluding the *chén* count. A season originally has four months but uses only three; a month originally has forty days but uses only thirty. Both exclude one *chén*, using three while leaving one unused. Heaven has three *chén*; Heaven is three, Earth is four. Heaven encompasses Earth’s surplus; Earth has the four phases.\n\nDividing thus, seven are employed. This is why celestial *chén* are unseen, and earthly waters remain ever concealed. Master Zhu said: \"The void where no stars appear is called *chén*.\" I humbly observe: The *Book of Changes* speaks of five celestial numbers, while Master Shao speaks of four celestial images. From whence do these four arise? Fundamentally, from one yin and one yang. One yang divides into two, yielding the images of Greater Yang and Lesser Yang—these are the sun and stars. One yin divides into two, yielding the images of Greater Yin and Lesser Yin—these are the moon and *chén*. Sun, moon, stars, and *chén* together form the four celestial images, none of which may be lacking. Yet Master Shao calls *chén* the celestial body, while Master Zhu says *chén* is the starless void that does not move. If so, then one *chén* serves two functions: as Lesser Yin and as the celestial body. Is this permissible? The answer is no. The celestial numbers originally comprise five, one being the Ultimate Non-Polar, and four □ forming the four images. Within these four images, one is embodied while three are employed. Lesser Yin becomes the body, upon which the sun, moon, and stars depend. As for the claim that *chén* is the starless void: *chén* is originally undifferentiated and unfathomable, the ultimate of embodiment. The sages designated the places where the sun and moon conjoin as *chén*. Thus, within the formless, no image is unencompassed. Its immobility, residing in the north as the pivot of the Pole Star, is called the Northern *Chén*. Therefore, while Lesser Yin is *chén* and constitutes the celestial body, the Northern *Chén* resides at the center of the celestial body and presides over the twelve *chén*. Hence, *chén* are used to distinguish directions, called the twelve stations; *chén* encompass stars and lands, called the twelve fields; *chén* encompass the twelve branches, twelve years, and twelve months—all are *chén*. Throughout the cosmos, vast or minute, high or low, none is not enclosed within them. For details, see the following section.\n\n**Celestial Pivot**\nIn the north there is *chén*, serving as the hub and pivot. Abiding at the center, unmoving, it revolves the Dipper’s handle externally to establish the four seasons and align the seven governances. The *Western Record* states: \"Among the central palace’s stars of the celestial pole, the brightest one is the constant abode of the Great One.\" I say: The One is the beginning of qi and numbers, without material form. That it \"constantly abides\" signifies the principle of residing at the center, unmoving. The *Eastern Record* states: \"The Northern *Chén* Star unites primordial radiance, erecting the imperial form, operating the mechanism, conferring measures, and unfurling the hundred spirits. The three steps and nine ranks, the Dipper’s balance and the Supreme Subtlety, the *shetis* and their kind—one hundred twenty constellations—along with the twenty-eight lodges, each arrayed in their places, correspond below to the twelve branches. Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the images of the stars and constellations are complete.\" I say: The nine words—unite, suspend, erect, operate, confer, unfurl, belong, array, and correspond—are most worthy of contemplation. They signify that the *chén*-pole encompasses all images of Heaven, Earth, stars, and constellations within it, hence it is said to be complete. When condensed, it is primordial qi; when dispersed, it becomes stellar radiance; when unfurled, it is the hundred spirits; when erected, it is the Dipper’s balance. Ban Gu called it *sheti*. Directly aligned with the Dipper’s handle, it establishes the seasonal nodes, hence it is also called the Celestial Pivot. The twenty-eight lodges are arrayed within the twelve *chén*, and the twelve *chén* are governed by the Northern *Chén*. Thus it is said: \"Abiding in its place, all stars share it.\" The *Er Ya* commentary states: \"The Dipper’s handle establishes the *chén* to rectify the four seasons, hence it is called *chén*. The Northern *Chén* encompasses the twelve *chén* within it. The Dipper’s handle points to the twelve *chén*.\" Many classics speak of the Northern Dipper but not the Northern *Chén*, for *chén* resides at the center, wu-wei, concealed within function. Thus, there is no visible marker to point to. What can be pointed to and spoken of is merely the Dipper’s handle as it establishes the *chén*. When the Northern Dipper is mentioned, the Northern *Chén* is thereby understood. Master Cheng said: \"The Northern *Chén* is inherently unmoving and serves as the master of qi and the most venerable of stars. Therefore, all stars encircle and orient toward it from all sides.\" I have examined and weighed the discourses of former masters and arrived at this understanding: The Northern *Chén*, unmoving, is the pivot of Heaven. Master Zhu said: \"The ancients took this as the pole and could not do without a marker. Thus, they selected a small star nearby and called it the Pole Star.\" Someone asked: \"Does the Pole Star move?\" He replied: \"It does move, but as it is near the *chén*, though it moves, the motion is imperceptible. Now, if one observes the Pole Star through a tube, one sees it move, but it remains within the tube, never moving beyond. Formerly, people said the Northern Pole was unmoving. By the Song dynasty, people had determined that the Northern Pole was merely near the *chén*, while the Pole Star still moved.\" Former accounts all took the \"silken star\" as the celestial pole, residing due north as the unmoving heart of Heaven. Now, upon verification, the celestial pole also revolves day and night. The immovable point lies within one and a half degrees of the Pole Star. Thus, in an armillary sphere, the central axle is fixed, unmoving, to represent the heart of Heaven. I observe: The five stars of the Northern Pole reside within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The northernmost star lies at the celestial heart. Ninety-one degrees separate it from each of the four directions. Ninety-one degrees of Heaven total three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter degrees. The four directions converge like spokes, and the *chén*-star resides at the center—within the northernmost star, where there is no star. All stars share it: the Northern *Chén* is to Heaven as the heart is to the human body—the master of the entire form. Hands, feet, ears, eyes, blood, vessels, skin, and flesh—none is unrelated. The world is nothing but people, yet the lord faces south to serve as their master. The celestial body is nothing but *chén*, yet the Northern *Chén* resides at the center to serve as its master. Even the degrees of the celestial sphere and the myriad beings in their multitude—none is not interconnected through it.\n\nThus, the unmoving *chén* serves as the root of all movement. Hence it is said: the formless governs the formed. This \"unused one\" is the ultimate of the limitless, descending to reside within us. Ah! How profound!\n\nMaster Zhu said: The North Pole is the pivot of Heaven, for it dwells at the center—hence it is called the North Pole. The South Pole lies at the center beneath the earth, directly opposite the North Pole. Though Heaven revolves, Earth remains unmoving at the center. Heaven’s form turns like a potter’s wheel, with the Pole as a crossbar fixed within it, its two ends firmly set. One end lies above the north—this is the North Pole. The other lies above the south—this is the South Pole.\n\nThe Great One, like an imperial throne within the Purple Tenuity, bears the title of Northern *Chén*. At its very center, in the starless void, lies the slightest point of stillness, which observers take as the Pole. Like the hub of a wheel, the navel of a millstone, Heaven circles Earth in ceaseless leftward rotation. Only this, its pivot, remains unmoving—fixed at the two ends of south and north. The South Pole dips thirty-six degrees below the earth, so that within its seventy-two-degree circuit, it is perpetually hidden from view. The *Old Tang History* records: travelers at sea once saw several bright stars beneath the South Pole, all within its seventy-two-degree span. The North Pole rises thirty-six degrees above the earth, so that within its seventy-two-degree circuit, it is perpetually visible. The star of the North Pole lies precisely within this ever-visible seventy-two-degree span, steadfast in its place, unmoving. Around it, the circumpolar stars revolve leftward with the turning sky. The sun and moon, as weft threads, move rightward in alternation, appearing and vanishing as if circling back toward it.\n\nMonk Yixing of the Tang observed: the distance between north and south spans over eighty thousand *li*. In the kingdom of Linyi to the south, the North Pole stands seventeen degrees high; at the Protectorate of Annan, it stands twenty-one degrees high. Other regions differ. The *Great History of the South* records... and others who reached the sea, gazing southward beneath the Old Man Star, saw a dazzling array of stars—none of which bore names in ancient texts. Someone asked: \"When the South Pole appears, the Old Man Star brings longevity—is this the South Pole?\" Master Zhu’s reply explains: the South Pole is not visible; rather, there is a distinct Old Man Star in the south. When the South Pole rises high, the Old Man Star emerges into view.\n\nThe Great One is the imperial seat, like a sovereign enthroned at the North Pole. Like an imperial capital within the Purple Tenuity, it lies within the seventy-two-degree span that is ever visible and never hidden—hence its title of Northern *Chén*. The *Former Records* state: of the stars at the celestial pole, the brightest is where the Great One eternally resides. The Great One, Heavenly August, Great Emperor of the North *Chén*—by these names it establishes the celestial measures, and it is also the Purple Tenuity Palace. The Celestial Emperor dwells at the center; \"purple\" signifies this central palace. Within this palace, the divine diagrams and the opening and closing of yin and yang all reside.\n\nMaster Zhu said: this *chén* remains ever in its place. Heaven’s form revolves day and night without cease, and this serves as its pivot. Like the hub of a wheel or the navel of a millstone, though it may seem to move, it cannot—it is not that it wills itself to be unmoving. Zhu Hanshang said: the *chén* is Heaven’s pivot, yet the unmoving point lies beyond it. Beneath the Pole Star, the sages spoke of it as the North *Chén*. Astronomers, however, refer to the point beneath the Pole Star—this is but a difference in precision.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why is the North *Chén* called Heaven’s pivot?\" The answer: Heaven is round and moves, enveloping Earth. Earth is square and still, resting at Heaven’s center. Thus, Heaven’s form half covers the earth above and half encircles it below, revolving leftward without end. Only this point remains unmoving—hence it is called the pivot. All other stars, along with the twenty-eight lunar lodges, share the same motion.\n\nMaster Zhu replied: consider the Supreme Subtlety in Wings, the Celestial Market in Tail, or the Dragging Stars in Neck—their southern distance from the celestial equator is slight, while their northern distance from the celestial pole is vast. Thus, they cannot remain unmoving but must revolve with the circumpolar stars. Their movements—east or west, hidden or visible—follow fixed degrees. Gazing upward, one sees not a moment’s pause. Yet those within the Purple Tenuity remain in their places, unmoving.\n\nIf this were so, then one Heaven would have four pivots, one wheel four hubs, one millstone four navels. The slightest shift in position would shatter it like broken spokes or shattered tiles—such a day would come swiftly. How then could motion endure without end?\n\nHu Wufeng remarked: there are said to be three unmoving Pole Stars—this is quite incomprehensible. If Heaven’s motion is like a turning millstone, then the Pole Star is merely the central stem, which does not move. If there were three unmoving stars, it could not turn.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan asked: \"The Pole Star lies at Heaven’s center, and all directions—east, west, south, north—are aligned by it. Yet why does the Pole Star always lie above them?\" Master Zhu had no answer at first. Later, he reflected: it is merely that one faces away from the Pole Star. If the Pole Star is north, then south has no fixed position.\n\nThe *Gongyang Commentary* states: the North *Chén* is the Great *Chén*, ever abiding in its place. Those who are lost, not knowing east from west, look to it. Yongjia’s Master Zheng said: the North Pole resides at Heaven’s center yet always lies to the north of people, for Heaven’s form inclines northward. Some say: the Dipper’s handle can point to the cardinal directions, but the *chén* serves no such purpose for the sun’s observation. Yet by its position, one knows where the *chén* lies.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* commentary says: the sun and moon are Heaven’s messengers; the stars and constellations are Heaven’s markers. One moves left, the other right, weaving the warp and weft. From the Dipper’s handle’s direction, it is called *jian*.\n\nFrom where the sun and moon conjoin, it is called *chén*. As the Dipper’s handle shifts left and the sun and moon drift right, the *chén* and *jiàn* thus invariably align. When the moon’s motion reaches the sun, their conjunction forms the *chén*. The *chén* itself has no fixed form but is revealed through the stars—hence the celestial standard’s auspiciousness. When the *chén* lies in *Xingji*, moving from north to west, the earthly standard aligns with Heaven, and the *Xuangan* corrects it at *Shiwei*. The western quadrant’s *Jianglou*, *Daliang*, and *Shishen*, the southern quadrant’s *Chunshou*, *Chunhuo*, and *Chunwei*, and the eastern quadrant’s *Shouxing*, *Dahuo*, and *Ximu*—their new moons may thus be known.\n\nThe *Chunqiu Wai Zhuan* states: \"When the sun and moon lodge in the Celestial Temple,\" it refers to the month of *jiàn-yín*. When the *chén* is in *Kezī*, it is the month of *jiàn-hài*. When the *chén* is in the *Tianhan*, the sun and moon conjoin at *Longtang*. Thus, by the new moon’s position, one knows the *chén*; by the *chén*’s conjunction, one knows the Dipper’s *jiàn*.\n\nIn my humble opinion: the Dipper’s handle and the North *Chén* are interconnected. The North *Chén* governs the twelve *chén*, while the Dipper’s handle points to them. Moreover, the *Gongyang Commentary* states: *Dahuo* is the Great *Chén*—here, *Jiazhong* arises from the *qi* of *Fang* and *Xin*, serving as the Celestial Emperor’s Bright Hall, also called the Celestial Palace. This is not comparable to the North *Chén*’s Great *Chén*. For instance, in the first month of *jiàn-yín*, the *chén* lies in the northeast, while the sun and moon conjoin in the northwest at *hài*—their *qi* harmonize because *yín* and *hài* align. The sun and moon always follow this pattern.\n\nThe Dipper’s monthly pointer is called *jiàn-dǒu*. Its first star is the *Kui*, the fourth the *Heng*, and the seventh the *Biao*. The *jiàn* at dusk is determined by the *Biao*, which belongs to *yin*; at midnight, the *jiàn* is determined by the *Heng*, which stands at the center of the three *jiàn*; the *Kui* belongs to *yang*. Calendar scholars use the sequence of *jiàn*, *chú*, *mǎn*, *píng*, *dìng*, *zhí*, *pò*, *wēi*, *chéng*, *shōu*, *kāi*, and *bì*—twelve days in total—repeating in cycles, observing their correspondences to determine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. With each month’s transition, the solar terms alternate, and two values align with the day. For example, in the first month, the *yín* day corresponds to *jiàn*, the *mǎo* day to the second, and the *chén* day to the third, aligning with the Dipper’s pointer.\n\nThe *Yi Zhuan* states: \"The number of the Great Expansion is fifty; its use is forty-nine. The one is the Supreme Ultimate.\" (Han scholar Ma Rong said: \"The *Yi* contains the Supreme Ultimate, referring to the North *Chén*. The Supreme Ultimate generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the sun and moon; the sun and moon generate the four seasons; the four seasons generate the Five Phases; the Five Phases generate the twelve months; the twelve months generate the twenty-four *qi*. The North *Chén* abides at the center, unmoving.\")\n\nSomeone objects: \"If so, then the Supreme Ultimate has this North Star to which it may be pointed. Yet Master Zhou [Dunyi] speaks of the Ultimateless (*wuji*) and yet the Supreme Ultimate—this seems not to be the case.\"\n\nI respond: The Supreme Ultimate is without sound or scent, the most subtle within which resides the most manifest principle. The North Star is the most central and ultimate, within its visible form lies the most subtle principle. Substance and function share a single origin; the manifest and the subtle are without separation. Thus the North Star, abiding at the center unmoving, can generate the Two Modes, the sun and moon, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the twelve months, and the twenty-four *qi*. The Supreme Ultimate, in its utmost quiescence, moves and can generate the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams—each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe North Star of Heaven subtly possesses form, resembling the Supreme Ultimate of the Master [Confucius]. The Supreme Ultimate of the Master is thus formless yet possesses form. The North Star of Heaven is the progenitor of *qi*, yet principle courses within it. The Supreme Ultimate is the progenitor of principle, yet *qi* courses within it. These may be of a single Dao.\n\nMaster Shao [Yong] said: \"Heaven swirls indistinct above, beyond measure—thus we observe the Dipper’s numbers to divine the heavens. The Dipper’s establishment is Heaven’s movement. The *kui* establishes *zǐ*, the handle establishes *yín*; the stars take *yín* as day.\" The Dipper has seven stars, so day and night are divided into no more than seven parts.\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"That the stars take *yín* as day is central. The stars take *yín* as dawn and *xū* as dusk. The sun takes *mǎo* and *yǒu* as midpoints, thus twelve divisions using seven. The stars take *yín* and *xū* as limits, thus ten divisions using seven.\"\n\nI elaborate: The Way of Heaven revolves leftward, taking the celestial stems as its body. The *qi* of no-thing is not visible—within its indistinctness, only the stars may be pointed to. The sun, moon, and five planets move rightward from the earth. The Dipper’s handle establishes the four seasons in balance.\n\nThe number of the Great Expansion is fifty; one is the Supreme Ultimate. Forty-nine is seven times seven, divided and used, each entering its proper place. One is the body of Heaven, one is the Seven Governors, one resides at the center—this is the Northern Dipper. Four arrayed in the four directions—these are the seven lodges. Thus Heaven and Earth, the four directions, take the Dipper as their pivot. Heaven’s movement through the four seasons begins from the Dipper and points forth. When the Dipper is correct, the seasons are correct; when the seasons are correct, the Dipper is correct. Thus calendars have methods of adjustment, but the Dipper has no deviation in its degrees. Those who skillfully regulate the calendar verify it against the Dipper alone.\n\nThe Northern Dipper’s seven stars lie within the Supreme Subtlety. The four stars of the *kui* form the *zōngjī*, the three stars of the handle form the Jade Balance. The Dipper is the symbol of the ruler, the master of decrees. The Assistant Star aids *Kāiyáng*, assisting the Dipper’s success—it is the symbol of the prime minister.\n\nFrom one to four is the *kui*; from five to seven is the handle. The first is Celestial Pivot; the second, *Zōng*; the third, *Jī*; the fourth, *Quán*; the fifth, Jade Balance; the sixth, *Kāiyáng*; the seventh, *Yáoguāng*.\n\nThe Pivot is Heaven, symbol of the Son of Heaven, the power of yang. *Zōng* is Earth, symbol of the female ruler, the punishment of yin. *Jī* is Man, the Decree Star, governing fire. *Quán* is Time, the Punitive Star, governing water. The Jade Balance is Sound, the Killing Star, governing earth. *Kāiyáng* is the Pitchpipe, the Perilous Star, governing wood and the Celestial Granary of the Five Grains. *Yáoguāng* is the Star, also called the Responsive Star, governing metal.\n\nThe Assistant Star, one in number, aids *Kāiyáng*, assisting the Dipper’s success and governing the correction of peril and the rectification of imbalance.\n\nSomeone asks: \"The Dipper has seven stars, and with the Assistant Star, eight. Yet astrologers speak of the Dipper having nine stars, governing the Nine Provinces—why is this?\" Another says: \"The *Treatise on Celestial Offices* mentions *Mèngkè* and *Shètí*. *Shètí* is a star’s name, following the Dipper’s handle to establish the twelve months. If this star is included to make nine, is this acceptable?\"\n\nI reply: There is no clear evidence for this; it cannot be followed. Master Zhang Heng, profound in his knowledge of Heaven, stated that the Northern Dipper and the four palace stars together make five sevens—thus the seven stars are the Dipper, and this cannot be increased.\n\nThe learning of blind musicians and historians in the *Yi* has degenerated into absurdity.\n\nScholars may well suspend judgment where doubt remains. Master Ouyang said: \"The relationship between Heaven and humanity is distant indeed. To have a practitioner of a single art deploy calculations and accumulated fractions, abandoning the classics to follow the historians in seeking concordance—is this not arduous?\"\n\nThe *Treatise on Celestial Offices* states: \"The so-called *xuanji* and jade balance align the Seven Governors. The handle connects to *Dragon’s Horn*, the balance rests upon *Southern Dipper*, and the *Fish-trap* leans upon *Triaster’s* head.\" The *Former Records* say: \"The handle is used for dusk alignment, the handle extending from *Huá* to the southwest. The balance is used for midnight alignment, the balance centered between the *Yellow River* and *Jǐ* in the Central States. The *Fish-trap* is used for dawn alignment, the *Fish-trap* in the lands east of the *Sea* and *Dài*. *Dān* means ‘to connect.’ *Dragon’s Horn* is *Celestial Fields*. The seven eastern lodges together form the shape of a dragon. *Yīn* means ‘center.’ The jade balance resides in the middle, with the northern and southern dippers aligned. The seventh star of the Dipper’s handle is the *Tail*, which belongs to *yin*. At dusk, *yin* occupies its position, thus governing the southwest. The balance star resides in the center; at dusk, the handle aligns with *yín*, and at midnight, the balance also aligns with *yín*. The first star of the *Fish-trap* belongs to *yang*, thus governing the northeast. This is why the Dipper’s handle connects to the star *Dragon’s Horn* in the east.\"\n\nThe *Essential Principles* states: \"What the Dipper aligns with are the earthly branches. Where the branches converge are the celestial stations. The Dipper and the branches unite.\" Note: The Dipper’s handle aligns with the twelve earthly branches, while the sun’s body moves through the twelve months, revolving rightward in conjunction with the lunar lodges. However, what the Dipper aligns with are the twelve earthly branches on earth, hence the terms *zǐ*, *chǒu*, and so forth. The branches are the conjunctions of the sun and moon, which occur in the twelve celestial stations, hence the terms *Kuízī*, *Jiànglóu*, and so forth. The twelve pitch-pipes serve as tubes for awaiting *qi*. The *yin* and *yang* of sound each have their correspondences, as with *Huángzhōng* aligning with the eleventh month, *jiànzǐ*, and *Dàlǚ* with the twelfth month, *jiànchǒu*, and so on. Thus, the Dipper and the branches unite with the lodges to complete the conjunctions of the sun and moon. The Dipper’s stars also revolve with the turning of Heaven.\"\n\nMaster Kong said: \"The Dipper’s stars, in one day and night, also revolve with Heaven, completing one circuit and moving one degree across the sky.\" The sage-kings observed the Dipper’s alignment to command the four seasons and divide the twelve monthly conjunctions. The *Book of Songs* says: \"In the north there is the Dipper, its western handle raised.\" Master Zhu said: \"The Northern Dipper is ever visible, never concealed. The Southern Dipper’s handle invariably points west. If the Northern Dipper’s handle points west, it is also autumn.\" Master Dong said: \"The Dipper has four stars forming its bowl, and three stars forming its handle, which hangs down and is raised. The Dipper revolves with the turning of Heaven, and in each of the four seasons, it has its own demarcated region. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: ‘The Dipper has its encircling domain.’\"\n\nMaster Li Zijian said: \"The Northern Dipper is Heaven’s tongue and throat, measuring and harmonizing the primordial *qi* to regulate the four seasons.\" The *Great Mystery* also says: \"The *yin* substance is the Northern Dipper; at night, it measures *yin*. It speaks of the *yin* night substance being rectified by the Northern Dipper, which calendars the sun and moon to determine the seasons and complete the year.\" Moreover, the North Pole and South Pole stand opposite each other as the *Pivot Stars*. The South Pole is concealed while the North Pole is visible, and people often speak of the visible one because it resides at the center of Heaven. The Northern Dipper has seven stars, an odd number, while the Southern Dipper has six stars, an even number—thus does Heaven display such artistry.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"When the branch is at the Dipper’s handle, the sun and moon conjoin at the Southern Dipper.\" Its stars are also divided into north and south: the two southern stars are called *Great Bridge*, the two central stars *Celestial Minister*, and the two northern stars *Celestial Court*. When the Dipper’s stars shine brightly, the kingly *Way* is harmonious and peaceful. Liu Xiang said: \"The Northern Dipper is the noble star, the image of the ruler.\" *Heaven’s Origins Unfolded*, Scroll Nine, concludes.\n\n**The Supreme Ultimate, Scroll Two: Movement and Stillness, Stillness and Movement**\n**Discerning Directions, Scroll Three**\n**The Mysterious and Undifferentiated, Scroll Four**\n**Division into Two, Scroll Five**\n**Derivation of the Five, Scroll Six**\n**Observing Images, Scroll Seven**\n**The Greater Yin, Scroll Eight**\n**The Lesser Yang, Scroll Nine**\n**The Lesser Yin, Scroll Ten**\n**The Celestial Pivot, Scroll Eleven**\n**Yearly Conjunctions and Qi Governance, Scroll Twelve**\n**Hexagram Qi and the Mysterious Essence, Scroll Thirteen**\n**Waxing and Waning, Scroll Fourteen**\n**Images and Numbers, Scroll Fifteen**\n**Prior and Posterior, Left and Right, Scroll Sixteen**\n**The Two Centers and Yang’s Return, Scroll Seventeen**\n**The Origin of Numbers, Scroll Eighteen**\n**Ghosts and Spirits, Scroll Nineteen**\n**Transformations**\n**Unfolding the Subtleties of the Celestial Origin, Scroll Twenty**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; Collated by Xu Gu Fang Hui and Wan Li*\n\nThe yearly conjunctions begin with twelve months, for six and six pair to form twelve. According to Shao Kangjie’s numerology, the daily, yearly, and epochal cycles all employ twelve: thus, one day has twelve hours, one year twelve months, one epoch twelve generations, and one great era twelve conjunctions. This encompasses past and present without exception. From one hour, one may infer a day; from one day, a month; from one month, a year; and from one year, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years. Extending this upward, how could it be limited merely to the twelve months of a year?\n\nThe twelve sovereign hexagrams outline the general principles, while the *Supreme Principles of the Sublime World* (*Huangji jingshi*) exhausts their ultimate depths. The *Sublime World Through the Ages* is a work of calendrical computation, using the twelve sovereign hexagrams to govern the twelve conjunctions, thereby fixing the seasonal nodes. Within this framework, one deduces the waxing and waning of fortune, simply by doubling the calculations. The hexagram qi of Jing Fang employs six days and seven fen, and Shao Kangjie likewise uses six days and seven fen. Kangjie’s and Jing Fang’s *Changes* are one and the same work, unrelated to the *Book of Changes*.\n\nMaster Zheng said: \"The movements of the sun and moon form twelve conjunctions in a year. The sage-kings followed these conjunctions to establish the great reckoning, observing their meetings to designate the four seasons.\" The hexagram qi system outlines its essentials, the *Great Mystery* (*Taixuan*) refines its details, and the *Sublime World* elaborates its wonders. Thereafter, the workings of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and epochs, and the rise and fall of emperors and kings may all be deduced.\n\nIn years, it is reckoned by waxing and waning; in months, by leaps and bounds; in days, by division into day and night.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"The great cycle undergoes a minor change every thirty years, a medium change every hundred years, and a major change every five hundred years. Three major changes make one epoch, and three epochs complete the great reckoning—such are the grand numbers.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"One great era governs twelve conjunctions, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty generations, just as one year governs twelve months, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty hours. The day is the era, the origin—its number is one. One year completes one cycle. The month is the conjunction, the meeting—its number is twelve. Twelve years complete twelve cycles. The star is the epoch, the movement of time, revolving leftward with the heavens, completing three hundred sixty cycles in a year. The hour is the generation, the end of change. One day has twelve hours, accumulating to four thousand three hundred twenty hours in a year. One generation spans thirty years, so twelve generations total one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years—this is the number of one great era. Within the great transformation, one era is like one year. From the era of the era to the hour of the era, from the era of the hour to the hour of the hour, the numbers are exhausted, and exhaustion brings change. The *Sublime World* records only the numbers of one era, yet from this, the numbers of Heaven and Earth may be known.\n\nOne era has one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years; one conjunction, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred months; one epoch, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred days; one generation, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred hours—all are natural numbers, not artificially contrived.\n\nIt is also said: The first six conjunctions are waxing, the latter six waning. This is like a year, where from *zi* to *si* is waxing, and from *wu* to *hai* is waning. Things open at the seventy-fifth star, like the *Jingzhe* solar term of the year. Things close at the three hundred fifteenth star, like the *Lidong* solar term of the year.\n\nSome ask: \"The qi overflows at three hundred sixty-six days, while the lunar phases are deficient at three hundred fifty-four. Why does the *Sublime World* consistently use three hundred sixty as its standard?\" The answer: \"This is to conceal its application within. From *zi* to *si*, waxing occurs as yang advances and yin retreats. By the end of the *si* month, at the two thousand one hundred sixtieth hour, yang reaches its peak, leaving a remainder of six for both yin and yang. From *wu* to *hai*, waning occurs as yin advances and yang retreats. By the end of the *hai* month, at the four thousand three hundred twentieth hour, yin reaches its peak, again leaving a remainder of six for both yin and yang. These total twenty-four, corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams in the *Book of Changes*. Excluding the four cardinal hexagrams, there are six lines per hexagram. Four times six is twenty-four; subtracting twenty-four from three hundred eighty-four leaves three hundred sixty. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the four cardinal hexagrams, occupying the four directions and remaining unchanged in reversal. The *Sublime World*’s reckoning of one era’s cycles takes the rounded numbers, with the methods of waxing, waning, fullness, and emptiness concealed within—this is how it hides its application.\n\nEmperor Yao began at the first *gui* star, the one hundred eightieth day, and the two thousand one hundred fifty-seventh hour. Why? It is said: \"By projecting today’s movements of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and Five Phases backward, this was derived.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Divided into twelve, the first six limits are waxing, the latter six waning. Advancing and retreating by three hundred sixty days corresponds to the era’s passage through the conjunctions. The twelve months are the twelve conjunctions; the three hundred sixty days are the three hundred sixty epochs.\"\n\nThe count of the *Primordial Era*’s *primordial* divisions takes one as its unit. Each *conjunction* comprises ten thousand eighty *primordial* divisions; each *epoch* comprises three hundred sixty *primordial* divisions. Summing the divisions of one *era* yields one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred *primordial* divisions of the *Primordial Era*.\n\nYang’s three hundred sixty are advance; yin’s three hundred sixty are retreat. Combined, three hundred sixty form seven hundred twenty.\n\nIt is also said: divided into thirty, this corresponds to the thirty days of one month. Following the waxing and waning of the *Great Epoch*, advance and retreat span sixty days. This accords with the reckoning of *conjunctions* through *epochs*: one month of thirty days is one *conjunction* of thirty *epochs*.\n\nFrom the perspective of months, leaps and intercalations alternate in application—one advance, one retreat—waxing and waning each yielding sixty *epochs*. From the perspective of days, day and night are further divided in application. One advance, one retreat, leaps and intercalations each yielding their counts, then one month’s count becomes one hundred twenty days, and one *conjunction*’s count becomes one hundred twenty *epochs*.\n\nIt is further said: one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, divided into twelve, corresponds to the twelve hours of one day, with an advance and retreat of six days. This accords with the reckoning of *epochs* through *eras*: when reckoning *eras* through *conjunctions*, these are the counts of *Year Hexagrams* and *Month Hexagrams*; when reckoning *conjunctions* through *epochs*, these are the counts of *Qi Hexagrams* and *Phase Hexagrams*; when reckoning *epochs* through *eras*, these are the counts of *Day Hexagrams* and *Hour Hexagrams*.\n\nOne day of twelve hours is one *epoch* of twelve *eras*. One is one *second*; twelve *seconds* make one *minute*; thirty *minutes* make one *hour*. In total, one day comprises four thousand three hundred twenty *seconds*. One hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred are thus the *seconds* of thirty days.\n\nAccumulating the years of one *epoch* yields nearly five hundred fifty-nine million eight hundred seventy-two thousand *seconds*—this is the count of *Tai*.\n\nThe advance and retreat of six days represent the count of one transformation. When reckoned as years, six days become six years; advancing to sixty years, in the *Lesser Epoch* this is ten transformations, while in the *Great Epoch* it is one transformation. For the Dao of Heaven transforms through six, yet always with a remainder.\n\nThe lesser six days traverse six celestial stems: *jiazi* and *jiawu* each mark one *era*. Thus, the *Great Epoch* transforms once every sixty years—this is the count of the Five *Epochs*. Heaven begins at *jia* and governs at *zi*; Earth begins at *ji* and governs at *mao*. Between *jia* and *ji*, the central *Earth Epoch* is seen. Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire succeed one another in turn. Heaven ends at *guihai*; Earth ends at *wuyin*. Spoken separately, each has sixty; spoken together, they total sixty. Thus, one great transformation completes one celestial cycle.\n\nThe *Lesser Epoch* transforms once every six years—this is the count of the Six *Qi*. The Six *Qi* begin with Heaven at *zi* and end at *si*; Earth responds by beginning at *mao* and ending at *shen*. Heaven begins at *wu* and ends at *hai*; Earth responds by beginning at *you* and ending at *yin*. The *Celestial Controller* and *Terrestrial Controller*, combined, form the Six *Qi*; separated, they are twelve, and when twenty-four are combined, they become twelve and six. Thus, sixty transformations also complete one celestial cycle.\n\nTherefore, the *Great Epoch* transforms through sixty, and six transformations, with their remainders, yield three hundred sixty-six. The *Lesser Epoch* transforms through six, and sixty transformations, with their remainders, also yield three hundred sixty-six.\n\nIt is also said: three hundred sixty corresponds to the count of one *hour*. Following the advance and retreat of the *Lesser Epoch*, this corresponds to the hours of day and night. One *hour* is one *era*. From the perspective of *hours*, three hundred sixty are *seconds*; from the perspective of *eras*, three hundred sixty are months. Three hundred sixty months are thus the years of one *era*.\n\nWhen corresponding to the hours of day and night, one *hour* becomes one *hour*. One *hour* comprises one hundred eighty *seconds*; accumulating one day yields two thousand one hundred sixty *seconds*—half of the four thousand three hundred twenty *minutes* in one day.\n\nFollowing the waxing and waning of the *Great* and *Lesser Epochs*: the six months after *zi* are waxing; the six months after *wu* are waning. Following the advance and retreat of the *Lesser Epoch*: the six hours after *zi* are advance; the six hours after *wu* are retreat. The *Great Epoch* has waxing and waning but no advance or retreat; the *Lesser Epoch* has advance and retreat but no waxing or waning. Waxing and waning are the accumulation of advance and retreat. From *zi* to *si* is waxing; from *wu* to *hai* is waning.\n\nThis exhaustively presents the counts of one *era*, encompassing the counts of retreat and intercalation within. As for the sun and moon, within their waxing and waning, each has its own advance and retreat. One year contains only seven hundred thirty day-and-night cycles. The *Tai Xuan* takes one day-and-night as one day, combining odd and even to make three hundred sixty-five days. The *Canon of Eras* takes day and night as separate days, adding the surplus of yang and the deficit of yin, totaling twelve days to form one hundred twenty days. Combining one hundred twenty with seven hundred twenty yields eight hundred forty days—this is one year of three hundred sixty days, divided into two to include both day and night, and accounting for intercalation.\n\nThe remainder of six days is dispersed among the six *jia*, yielding sixty *jiazi*. The intercalary count of six days, combined to make one hundred twenty, serves the use of humans and all beings.\n\nWithin the six counts, days are divided into day and night, numbers into leaps and intercalations, each forming twelve. One becomes two, each encompassing waxing and waning; two becomes four, revealing one *limit*. Advancing sixty days, retreating sixty days—six *limits* advance and retreat, totaling three hundred sixty days. Another *limit* advances six days and retreats six days, together forming seven aspects of waxing and waning. Thus, fourteen *conjunctions* yield seven hundred twenty days, all using half-counts.\n\nSome say: advancing twelve days makes one hundred twenty; retreating twelve days also makes one hundred twenty.\n\nCombining the surplus of yang’s fullness, dividing the six intersecting counts of the new moon, six voids also suffice, and two hundred fifty-two likewise accords. It is also said: the establishment of the great and small cyclical counts.\n\nThe structural count numbers three hundred eighty-four, yet the operational count stops at three hundred sixty-one years, with the standard count yielding three hundred sixty. Applying the *Scripture of Epochs* to deduce it, using nine of twelve conjunctions yields two hundred seventy days. Now, within one *yuan* of three hundred sixty cycles, only two hundred forty cycles are used, and the intercalary count does not exceed two hundred fifty-two, for eight conjunctions are left unused. This is because *yin* opens at *yin* and closes at *xu*, and *xu* is also unused.\n\nHeaven has its seasons for generating beings, and Earth has its counts for generating beings. Speaking in terms of Heaven, one year uses three hundred sixty. Speaking in terms of Earth, from the sprouting of grasses and trees to the first freezing of the ground, only two hundred fifty-two are used. Thus, the *Diagram of Hexagram Qi* in days numbers three hundred eighty-four; in hours, it numbers two hundred fifty-six. There are only three thousand seventy-two hours—this is how the great and small cycles are distinguished.\n\nTaking the full twelve *limit*-counts, advancing and retreating three hundred sixty days, another *limit* advances six days and retreats likewise. Yin and yang continue in succession, dividing governance within one *yuan*. Speaking separately, each has three hundred sixty yin. Dividing the yang and analyzing the half-counts—if speaking in combination, yang advances while yin retreats, together forming three hundred sixty, for yang encompasses yin, totaling the full count.\n\nThus, this method of the great cycle, when distinguished from the intercalary count, clarifies the numbers of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, where standard and intercalary counts mutually generate, divide halves for common use, share a root yet bear different names.\n\nIt is also said: establishing the small cycle method at one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred. Removing the three of intersecting counts, taking the seven of operational counts. The operational method forms six from three, adding surplus fractions, hence seven. The great cycle method focuses on clarifying structure, so the structure of the small cycle may be known. The small cycle method focuses on clarifying function, so the function of the great cycle may be known. They mutually reveal one another.\n\nIn structure, it is the operational count of structure: three hundred sixty. In function, it is the operational count of function: two hundred fifty-two. Intersecting counts are unused counts. Operational counts manifest yang; intersecting counts conceal yin. Heaven unifies structure; Earth divides function.\n\nSpeaking of the count of one *yuan*, operational counts are seven and intersecting counts are three—yang prevails over yin. Seven parts of Heaven lie above Earth, while three parts intersect below Earth, referring to the division of day and night in *kan*, *li*, *mao*, and *you*. Yang encroaches upon yin, day encroaches upon night—this is the principle of three Heavens and two Earths.\n\nSpeaking of one day, from *yin* to *xu*. Speaking of twelve conjunctions, from *Opening Beings* to *Closing Beings*, within one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, nine myriads seven hundred twenty counts are taken for use. Speaking of day counts, within three hundred sixty days, seven-tenths are taken, yielding two hundred fifty-two for use. Speaking of one year, three-tenths of winter are unused. Speaking of one day, three-tenths of night are unused.\n\nAt the two solstices and two equinoxes, dividing three hundred sixty yields one hundred eighty. This is the count of their separation.\n\nMaster Zhu said: From the winter solstice to the spring equinox is advancing to the halfway point, hence called *equinox*. From the spring equinox to the summer solstice is advancing to the extreme, hence called *solstice*. Advancing past the extreme leads to retreating to the solstice; the autumn equinox is retreating halfway. Reaching the winter solstice is retreating to the extreme.\n\nThe *Nine Yangs of One Hundred Six* cycle. In years of flood and drought, the cyclical movements have constancy. According to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars*: nineteen years make one *zhang*. Four *zhang* make one *bu*, twenty *bu* make one *tong*. Three *tong* make one *yuan*, totaling four thousand five hundred sixty years. Entering the *yuan* at one hundred six years, there is *Yang Nine*, referring to nine years of drought. Next, at three hundred seventy-four years, there is *Yin Nine*, referring to nine years of flood. Combining one hundred six years and three hundred seventy-four years yields four hundred eighty years. The annotation states: the number of six multiplied by eight.\n\nThis is from Wei Heshān’s *Essential Meanings*. In my humble opinion: history records that the Han dynasty suffered the calamity of *Yang Nine*. Yao endured nine years of flood, and Tang endured seven years of drought. From this, it may be deduced. Yet Yao and Shun, through virtue, mitigated change, for floods and droughts arise from Heaven’s counts and thus could not cause harm. The Han dynasty’s calamity, however, arose from human action and cannot be wholly attributed to Heaven. Thus it is said: “Heaven-made disasters may yet be avoided; self-made disasters cannot be escaped.” This is what it means.\n\nThe middle count is called *sui*; the new-moon count is called *nian*. The Grand Scribe oversees the correction of *sui* and *nian* to order affairs. The middle count refers to twelve months, with the total of midpoints numbering three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter days, called *sui*. The new-moon count refers to the new moons of twelve months, one cycle numbering three hundred fifty-four days, called *nian*. This is the contrast between *sui* and *nian*, hence the distinction between new moon and midpoint. Yet if spoken of separately, they are one.\n\nThe *Erya*’s *Explanation of Heaven* states: In the Tang and Yu dynasties, it was called *zai*; in the Xia, *sui*; in the Shang, *si*; in the Zhou, *nian*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Shao Kangjie’s twelve conjunctions of one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years, when deduced from small to large, are all uniform, meaning years, months, days, and hours all align. The first conjunction of ten thousand eighty years is when Heaven first opens. The second conjunction of ten thousand eighty years is when Earth first congeals. The third conjunction is when beings first arise, called *Opening Beings*. This time belongs to *yin*; at *xu*, it is *Closing Beings*, the time when beings are extinguished. For the most part, it is half-bright and half-dark, resembling day and night.\n\nWhen the first *yuan* reaches its end, Heaven and Earth undergo another unfolding. Taking the single *qi* of Heaven and Earth as an analogy, one day and one night suffice to illustrate this. From this winter solstice to the next, the *qi* completes one cycle. Dividing it into two segments, the first is *yang*, the latter *yin*. Further dividing it into four yields the four seasons. Spring and summer exhale, autumn and winter inhale—it is but a single *qi*. Once *yang* *qi* ascends to its peak, it nears exhaustion, and *yin* arises. As *yin* *qi* nears its end, *yang* is born anew. The *qi* that has been expended disperses—this is what is meant by waxing and waning.\n\nHeaven’s revolution in a month sees the sun complete one rotation, yet there are also times of greater turning that cannot be confined to a single pattern.\n\nIn my humble observation: *Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Yi*. The *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams serve as the hinges and bolts of these gates, opening and closing them. From *zi*, when *yang* is born, the gate of *Qian* opens. Its movement is also called *Heaven opens at zi and yin*. Thus, the Dipper’s handle points here, and the unfolding begins. Its name is *Zhen*, and the ten thousand things emerge. *Qian* divides them, and so it continues until *si*. From *wu*, when the first *yin* is born, the gate of *Kun* closes. Its stillness is contraction. *Xun* causes *yin* to diminish and *yang* to grow, and the ten thousand things enter. *Kun* conceals them, and so it continues until *hai*. One opening, one closing—like two doors. When one opens, the other closes. When *yang* comes, it opens; when *yang* departs, it closes.\n\nViewed thus, the earlier scholars’ saying that when expansion prevails, Heaven and Earth transform and the grasses and trees flourish, while when expansion fails, Heaven and Earth close and the worthy withdraw—this too depends on humanity. When Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu ruled above, the eras of Tang, Yu, Shang, and Zhou were bright with *yang*. Otherwise, upright scholars were imprisoned as slaves, poison and pain spread across the four seas, books were burned and scholars buried, the world dissolved, stones moved, Zhu Wen defiled human relations, and Heaven and Earth were overturned. At such times, without waiting, the sun and moon lost their light, the cosmos darkened, and beings could not but be consumed. Alas! Such things are hard to speak of.\n\nIt is further said: Heaven opens at *zi*, Earth unfolds at *chou*, and humans are born in the month of the Three Luminaries—all may serve as the beginning of the year, and the Three Dynasties successively adopted them. The Xia took *yin* as the human standard, the Shang took *chou* as the earthly standard, and the Zhou took *zi* as the heavenly standard. Yet when it comes to conducting affairs by the seasons, the year and months ought naturally to be reckoned by the human standard. Thus Confucius once said, “I have obtained the Xia calendar,” and commentators took this to refer to works like the *Xia Xiao Zheng*, for he valued its seasonal correctness and the excellence of its ordinances.\n\nSomeone asked: Why did the Shang and Zhou, in changing the first month of the year, not attain the correctness of the Xia calendar? The answer is: Though *yang* qi begins at *huangzhong*, its month is *jianzi*. Yet it still lies concealed within the earth, and its power to generate life remains unseen. When the calendar turns from *chou* to *yin*, the three *yang* are complete. Then the harmonious winds arrive, the great *power* resides in Wood, and the spring *qi* responds. The sages of antiquity took this as the beginning of life’s generation and the starting point of the year’s renewal—based on what all people could observe. □ speaking of it, none knew its true origin.\n\nAs for the Shang and Zhou, they first gained the world through military conquest. Thereupon they altered the first month of the year, establishing it as an institution for their dynasties, to renew the perceptions of the world, and thus arose the theory of the Three Sequences. Yet in terms of Heaven, the power to generate life was not yet manifest; in terms of Earth, the meaning of the year’s renewal was unclear. Moreover, the order of the four seasons and five phases could not attain central correctness. This is why Confucius examined the institutions of the Three Kings and chose to follow the Xia calendar.\n\nUpon reviewing various transmitted records, though the Three Dynasties differed in their first month of the year, all began their reckoning with *jianyin*. For court assemblies and the distribution of calendars to mark the seasons, they conducted affairs by the first month of the year. Yet in counting the months, all took *yin* as the first. The *Yi Xun* speaks of “the twelfth month,” and the date “yichou” refers to the Shang, which took *jianchou* as the first month, thus making the twelfth month the first. *Yichou* is the day, not tied to the new moon, for it is not the first day of the month. As for changing the first month of the year without altering the count of months, this can still be verified in the classics and histories.\n\nThe Zhou took *jianzi* as the first month, yet the *Book of Songs* speaks of “the fourth month” and “the sixth month of summer.” The *Zuozhuan* counts months from *yin*, never altering it. The Qin took *jianhai* as the first month, yet the *Records of the Grand Historian* states that in the thirty-first year of the First Emperor, “the twelfth month was renamed *La*, called *Jiaping*.” Now, *La* is the *jianchou* month. If the Qin took *hai* as the first month, then *La* would be the third month. Saying it was the eleventh month shows that the Qin, too, counted months from *yin* and never altered it. In the thirty-seventh year, it records: “In the tenth month, *guichou*, the First Emperor went on a tour. In the eleventh month, he reached Yunmeng.” Then it continues: “In the seventh month, *bingyin*, the First Emperor died. In the ninth month, he was buried at Mount Li.” That it first records the tenth and eleventh months, then the seventh and ninth, shows that it took the tenth month as the first of the year but still counted months from *yin*, never altering it.\n\nThe Qin official records state that the year’s beginning was changed, and court congratulations were all held on the first day of the tenth month. The Qin succeeded the Zhou; if it had changed the count of months, then the Zhou’s tenth month would have been *jianyou*. How could it then be *jianhai*? The Han followed the Qin first month, and the histories record: “In the first year, winter, the tenth month,” making it clear that the first month of the year was changed but the count of months was not.\n\nMoreover, according to the Han scholar Kong, spring was taken as the *jianzi* month, for he held that the Three Dynasties, in changing the first month of the year, also altered the count of months and took their first month as the head of the four seasons. The *Tai Shi* speaks of “the first month, *wuwu*,” where “one” is a corruption of “three.” Since he took the first month as *jianzi*, and the classic also associates it with spring, he thus took the *jianzi* month as spring. Yet in reality, the first month is early spring. If this were so, the four seasons would be disordered, which is even more unreasonable. Winter cannot be made spring, nor cold made warm—this is evident without need for argument.\n\nSomeone said: Zheng’s commentary on the *Book of Songs*, “Wei Mo’s spring,” also refers to the Zhou’s late spring, which in the Xia calendar is early spring. The answer is: This is an error inherited by the Han scholars. The “Ministers and Workers” poem speaks of late spring, when they should prepare their new offerings. Yet how is it now? The wheat is about to ripen, and they can receive the bright gifts of the Supreme Lord. When wheat is about to ripen, it is the *jianchen* month, clearly the late spring of the Xia calendar. Zheng’s commentary on the *Book of Songs* fails to grasp its meaning and interprets it inaccurately. Otherwise, the Shang would take late winter as spring, and the Zhou would take mid-winter as spring, reversing the four seasons and losing their correctness. How could the sages of the Three Dynasties, in following Heaven’s governance, have done this?\n\nIt is further said: Though the Zhou took *zi* as the first month and thus attained the heavenly sequence, Confucius’ discussion of governing a state took the Xia calendar as correct, for it clearly follows the beginning and end of *yin* and *yang*. *Yang* begins at *zi* and ends at *si*; *yin* begins at *wu* and ends at *hai*. In terms of the *qi* of the four seasons, *yang* begins at *yin* and ends at *wei*, while *yin* begins at *shen* and ends at *chou*. Though these two accounts seem to differ slightly, the discrepancy is only two positions.\n\nAt the *zi* position, though one *yang* is born, it has not yet emerged from the earth. At the *yin* position, the *Tai* hexagram, the three *yang* have just emerged above the earth, and the warm, generous *qi* begins from this point. At the *si* position, the *Qian* hexagram, though the six *yang* are at their peak, the warm, generous *qi* has not yet ended. Thus, though one *yin* is born at *wu*, it does not yet harm the *yang*. Only at the *wei* position, the *Dun* hexagram, does the warm, generous *qi* finally dissipate. At the *wu* position, though *yin* has been born, the severe, congealing *qi* only begins at *shen*.\n\nAt the *hai* position, though the six *yin* are at their peak, the severe, congealing *qi* only dissipates at *chou*. The principle here follows the same pattern.\n\nShao Kangjie’s *Twelve Conjunctions* states that at *zi*, Heaven exists but Earth has not yet formed; at *chou*, Earth exists but humanity has not yet appeared; and only at *yin* does humanity emerge—all marking the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Thus, the Three Dynasties took these starting points and established them as their first months. Hence it is said: the establishment of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* as the first months all belong to the three *yang* months. If the Qin had taken *hai* as the first month, it would have been entirely baseless.\n\nIt is further said: Within the *Xiantian* Diagram, the twelve *bi* hexagrams are also contained. On the left side, from *zi* to *si*, there are thirty-two *yang* hexagrams. Beginning with *Zhen*, *Fu* divides into sixteen hexagrams. The second *yang* ascends to *Dui*, forming *Lin*; from *Lin* upward through eight hexagrams, it enters the *Qian* palace and ascends. The third *yang* forms *Tai*, the fourth *Zhuang*, the fifth *Da Zhuang*, and the sixth *Qian*, concluding the fourth month. On the right side, from *wu* to *hai*, there are thirty-two *yin* hexagrams. *Xun* generates *Sheng*, dividing into sixteen hexagrams. The second *yin* descends to *Gen*, forming *Dun*; from *Dun* downward through eight hexagrams, it enters the *Kun* palace and descends. The third *yin* forms *Pi*, the fourth *Guan*, the fifth *Bo*, and the sixth *Kun*, concluding the tenth month. The *yang* hexagrams take one from the *Zhen* palace and four from the *Qian* palace. The *yin* hexagrams take one from the *Xun* palace and four from the *Kun* palace. This illustrates that the two *qi* of *yin* and *yang*—at their inception, they are subtle and gradual; at their culmination, they are swift and intense. Subtle and gradual, they root and nourish the source of the myriad things. Swift and intense, they generate and destroy the myriad things, accomplishing their work.\n\nThe *Kan* and *Li* palaces are not taken, for they show that the two *qi* of water and fire flow between Heaven and Earth. What is not used here is in fact used everywhere without exception. The *bi* hexagrams, laid out flat, correspond to the four seasons in pairs, so that the twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two pentads are arranged within them without disorder. The eight palaces of the *Xiantian* Diagram stand in fixed opposition. Among the twelve *bi* hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* alone govern eight of them. Thus, the father and mother of the myriad things—birth, growth, harvest, and storage—all proceed from these.\n\nMaster Shao said: The Dao began with Fuxi, was perfected under Yao, reformed by the Three Kings, reached its limit with the Five Hegemons, and was severed by the Qin. The order and chaos of the myriad things in recent times cannot escape this pattern. It began with Fuxi, who opened things at *yin*. It was perfected under Yao, when *yang* was pure at *si*. It was reformed by the Three Kings, when *yin* was born at *wu*. It reached its limit with the Five Hegemons, when the *yang* Dao was exhausted. It was severed by the Qin, which imposed a barrier. What Master Shao called the principles of emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons—father and son, lord and minister—were all bounded by the Qin. The boundary was cut off at the Qin, and the Dao could no longer be practiced.\n\nIt is further said: The *Book of Changes* began with the Three Sovereigns, the *Book of Documents* with the Two Emperors, the *Book of Songs* with the Three Kings, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* with the Five Hegemons. This theory holds that the era of the Two Sovereigns was like spring, the era of the Five Emperors like summer, the era of the Three Kings like autumn, and the era of the Five Hegemons like winter. It is also said: The Seven States were the lingering embers of winter. The Han was a king but fell short; the Jin was a hegemon but had excess. The Three Kingdoms were the heroes of hegemony; the Sixteen Kingdoms were a thicket of hegemons. The Southern Five Dynasties were hegemons riding on borrowed power; the Five Dynasties were a relay station for hegemons. The Sui was the younger brother of the Tang; the late Sui’s various commanderies were hegemons, the last ripples of the Yangzi and Han. The late Tang’s various warlords were hegemons, the lingering light of the sun and moon. The Later Five Dynasties were hegemons, stars at dawn.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Before Yao, there were also those like the Five Hegemons. Within the great cycles, there are smaller cycles to distinguish them in detail. Only the closer eras are visible, as earlier records have not been transmitted. Master Shao’s statement that within the eras of emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons, there are further emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons is correct. Taking the Han dynasty as an example, even within it there were emperors, kings, and hegemons among the shorn barbarians. Those who ruled by non-action were emperors like Gaozu and Empress Lü; those who ruled by benevolence and trust were emperors like Emperor Wen; those who ruled by cunning and force were hegemons like Emperor Wu. Emperor Xuan was a king among hegemons; Emperor Wu was a hegemon among kings. This is like the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, summer. Hegemons who were barbarians ranked even lower.\n\nAlas! How fortunate it would be to have lived in the time of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nIt is further said: The *qi* of Heaven and Earth moves from north to south to bring order, and from south to north to bring chaos. When chaos has lasted long, it returns from north to south. This is true of both the Dao of Heaven and human affairs. Extending this to successive dynasties reveals the principle of waxing and waning.\n\nIt is also said: *Yin* affairs exceed half, for *yang* is one while *yin* is two. Thus, ordered eras are few while chaotic eras are many; the noble are few while the petty are many. In my humble opinion: The numbers of *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* cycles—one *yun* spans 360 years—can be used to infer the order and chaos of successive dynasties. From *zi* to *mao* is *yin* within *yang*, heralding order. From *mao* to *wu* is *yang* within *yang*, the height of order. From *wu* to *you* is *yang* within *yin*, heralding chaos. From *you* to *zi* is *yin* within *yin*, the height of chaos.\n\nIn the *Xiantian* Diagram, from *Tai* through *Gu* to *Pi*, and from *Pi* through *Sui* to *Tai*, this is the cycle of north and south. For *Tai* and *Pi* stand opposite each other, as do *Gu* and *Sui*. Thus it is said: from *Tai* to *Pi*, *Gu* lies between them. Who brings about *Gu*? It is when *yin* prevails, *yang* is halted by *Gen*, and the *yin* evil of *Xun* enters—then *Pi* arrives. From *Pi* to *Tai*, *Sui* lies between them. Who brings about *Sui*? It is when *yang* of *Zhen* moves in accord, and the *yin* of *Dui* follows—then the people rejoice without bound, and *Tai* is fitting in all ways. These *Pi*, *Tai*, *Gu*, and *Sui* are perhaps the gates of Heaven and Earth, the paths of humanity and spirits, the intersections of entry and exit.\n\nNumbers flow forward in sequence: from *Zi* to *Wu*, through *Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, and *Qian*—this is the image of order. To foresee what comes, one traces backward: from *Wu* to *Zi*, through *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*—this is the image of chaos. Observe it facing south with your back to the north, and you will understand the reversal.\n\nFrom the Tang through the Five Dynasties, spanning six *jiazi* cycles, there was an equal measure of order and chaos. From the *Qiande* reign of the Song to the present, another six *jiazi* cycles have passed. Midway, southerners held power, and the southern creatures followed the *qi*, overstepping the north and bringing chaos. Master Kangjie deduced this through numerology: six *jiazi* cycles make three hundred and sixty years, corresponding to the twelve hours of a day. The reckoning begins with the *jiachen* year of Yao, with the months *si*, *chen*, *wei*, and the star *gui*. Now, the moon still resides in *Wu*, while the celestial stem has just passed *You*. This accounts for three thousand six hundred and sixty years, yet only one hundred and twenty-two hours have elapsed. How swift it is! The span from ancient times to the present, within Heaven and Earth, is but a single day and night.\n\nThe sage comprehends the Dao of day and night and thus knows how to observe a single hour to understand all hours, a single generation to understand all generations. I have recorded the world’s fortunes across the twelve epochs. When an epoch ends, how could one not feel moved?\n\n**The Governance of *Qi***\n\nThe earthly numbers begin with two. Two multiplied by six makes the twelve months; two multiplied by four makes the twenty-four *qi*; two multiplied by three makes the seventy-two *hou*. Within these twelve sovereign hexagrams lie the seventy-two *hou*. Within the four cardinal hexagrams lie the twenty-four *qi*. Within the sixty hexagrams lie the three hundred and sixty days.\n\nThe Han initially designated *Jingzhe* as the central *qi* of the first month and *Yushui* as the first month’s solar term. This was later revised at the end of the Former Han. Thus, the *Lüli Zhi* states: \"In the first month, *Lichun* is the solar term and *Yushui* the central *qi*; in the second month, *Jingzhe* is the solar term and *Chunfen* the central *qi*.\" It speaks of hibernating creatures: in the first month, they first stir; in the second, they stir greatly. Hence, the later text states: \"In the *Santong* calendar, *Guyu* is the third month’s solar term and *Qingming* the central *qi*.\" According to the *Tonggua Yan* and the current calendar, *Qingming* is the third month’s solar term and *Guyu* the central *qi*; the rest align with the *Lüli Zhi*.\n\nThe *Yueling* records the seasonal phenomena of the twelve months, though its structure varies. Some *qi* and *hou* are listed in order, others out of sequence. For the months of the two solstices and two equinoxes, phenomena are recorded twice, for these are the beginnings and endings of *yin* and *yang*, the intersections of their exchange. These are the great nodes, which the sage-kings treated with utmost care.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"*Kan* is the hexagram of the true north.\" It also says: \"*Dui* is the true autumn.\" And again: \"The former kings, on the solstices, closed the gates.\" The later generations’ *qi*, seasons, and sequences were already fully contained in the *Yi*. Since *Kan* is called the hexagram of the true north, then *Zhen* as east, *Dui* as west, and *Li* as south are self-evident. When *Dui* is called the true autumn, it refers to the autumnal equinox; thus, *Zhen* corresponds to the vernal equinox, *Li* to the summer solstice, and *Kan* to the winter solstice—these are self-evident. The *Daxiang* of *Fu* states that on the solstice, the gates are closed, referring to the winter solstice; thus, *Gou* corresponds to the summer solstice—this, too, is self-evident. One who understands the *Yi* can grasp the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* *qi* through analogy.\n\nMaster Wei of Heshān said: \"Autumn is the *yin* within *yin*; spring is the *yang* within *yang*. The *yin* *qi* begins in the fifth month and ends in the tenth, so the seventh and eighth months are the *yin* within *yin*. Though *yang* is present within *yin*, *yin* dominates. The *yang* *qi* begins in the eleventh month and ends in the fourth, so the first and second months are the *yang* within *yang*. Though *yin* is present within *yang*, *yang* dominates.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"From this year’s winter solstice to the next, it is but a single cycle of *qi*. Divided in two, spring and summer are *yang*, autumn and winter are *yin*. Divided into four, they become the four seasons. Further divided, they become the twenty-four *qi* and seventy-two *hou*—all originating from this.\"\n\n**The Twenty-Four *Qi***\n\nAs Kongzi said:\n- First month: *Lichun* (solar term), *Yushui* (central *qi*)\n- Second month: *Jingzhe* (solar term), *Chunfen* (central *qi*)\n- Third month: *Guyu* (solar term), *Qingming* (central *qi*)\n- Fourth month: *Lixia* (solar term), *Xiaoman* (central *qi*)\n- Fifth month: *Mangzhong* (solar term), *Xiazhi* (central *qi*)\n- Sixth month: *Xiaoshu* (solar term), *Dashu* (central *qi*)\n- Seventh month: *Liqiu* (solar term), *Chushu* (central *qi*)\n- Eighth month: *Bailu* (solar term), *Qiufen* (central *qi*)\n- Ninth month: *Hanlu* (solar term), *Shuangjiang* (central *qi*)\n- Tenth month: *Lidong* (solar term), *Xiaoxue* (central *qi*)\n- Eleventh month: *Daxue* (solar term), *Dongzhi* (central *qi*)\n- Twelfth month: *Xiaohan* (solar term), *Dahan* (central *qi*)\n\n*Yushui* (Rain Water): Snow disperses into rain. Falling from above is called rain; the north wind freezes it into snow, and the east wind thaws it into water.\n*Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects): Hibernating creatures stir and emerge.\n*Guyu* (Grain Rain): Rain nurtures the hundred grains.\n*Qingming* (Pure Brightness): All things grow pure, bright, and clean.\n*Xiaoman* (Lesser Fullness): Things grow to a small measure of fullness.\n*Mangzhong* (Grain in Beard): Grains with beards may be sown.\n*Xiaoshu* and *Dashu* (Lesser and Greater Heat): The peak of heat is divided into lesser and greater, with the former at the month’s beginning and the latter at its midpoint.\n*Chushu* (End of Heat): Heat retreats and hides.\n*Bailu* (White Dew): *Yin* *qi* gradually intensifies, and dew congeals, turning white.\n*Hanlu* (Cold Dew): The *qi* of dew grows cold, nearing congelation.\n*Xiaoxue* and *Daxue* (Lesser and Greater Snow): In the tenth month, snow is light; in the eleventh, it grows heavy.\n*Xiaohan* and *Dahan* (Lesser and Greater Cold): In the twelfth month, cold is light at the beginning and severe at the midpoint.\n\nEach of the twenty-four *qi* spans slightly more than fifteen days. Dividing each *qi* in half yields forty-eight *qi*, each lasting slightly more than seven and a half days. The *Zhouli* speaks of eighteen arrows for the sun, meaning one arrow is changed with each *qi*. Between the twenty-four *qi*, dividing the *qi* into three parts yields slightly more than five days, hence the seventy-two *hou* in a year.\n\nMaster Ou said: \"For the seventy-two *hou*, each is placed at the midpoint of a solar term. The beginning of a term is a *hou*. By accumulating the *hou* in the hexagrams, one arrives at the central *qi*, which corresponds to the next hexagram. Naming them according to the Five Phases’ governance yields the hexagrams of the dukes.\"\n\nBy accumulating the counting rods, one arrives at the inception of spring wood, summer fire, autumn metal, and winter water. Placing the nodes of the four seasons yields the governance of earth. The lines of the twelve sovereign hexagrams correspond to the midpoints of the seventy-two *hou*. The first *hou* precedes the new *qi* by three days, while the latter follows the new *qi* by three days. As the *hou* divide the inner and outer, sixty hexagrams correspond to the three hundred sixty days of the year. With twelve months and twelve central *qi*, the subsequent *hou* of sixty-four are placed at the four *li*. The nodes of winter are reckoned by the *wei* counting rods. Adding these yields the twelve duke hexagrams to govern them.\n\nFor example, in the eleventh month, the initial six of *Kan* (坎) is the central *qi* of sincerity, corresponding to the sovereign hexagram *Fu* (復) and the *hou* of *Zhun* (屯), which spans three days. The nine-two of *Kan* corresponds to the *hou* of *Zhun* externally, the minister hexagram *Qian* (謙), and the *qing* hexagram *Kui* (睽), which is the subsequent hexagram three days after the *qi*.\n\nThe four *li*—wood at *Lixia* (立夏), fire at *Lixia* (立夏, seasonal month), the month of the winter solstice as the duke’s central inner *qi* preceding the new *qi* of the twelfth month—along with *Lidong* (立冬) for water and *Liqiu* (立秋) for metal, are all the initial nodes of the four *meng* seasons where the Five Phases govern. *Gen* (艮) and *Xun* (巽) occupy the four corner positions, dividing the six *qi*. The four seasons—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—are the times when earth governs. *Kan* (坎), *Li* (離), *Zhen* (震), and *Dui* (兌) are the four cardinal hexagrams.\n\nEach hexagram’s two lines govern five hexagrams, completing a month’s governance as the new moon. One line governs two and a half hexagrams. Six lines govern fifteen hexagrams, completing a season of three months. Taken together, the four seasons yield four times six, totaling twenty-four. Examined in detail, there are nodes, *qi*, and *hou*, each ordered without confusion.\n\nI have tentatively interpreted this according to my understanding—whether it aligns with Master Ou’s intent remains uncertain. Some say: in the first month of *jia* and *si*, there are six changes; in twelve months, seventy-two changes. Calling these *hou* is also plausible.\n\nThe *Kao of the Celestial Controller* states: seventy-two is the number of the Five Phases’ transformations and completions. This is the canonical method. The counting rods of yang: thirty-six, doubled. The counting rods of yin: twenty-four, tripled. The numbers of yin and yang never fail to harmonize. The seventy-two *hou* are likewise derived from this principle. The seventy-two *hou* were employed by the royal astronomer in the calendar, reaching the utmost precision. I once sought its rationale in vain, pondering through the night until at last I grasped it.\n\nThis refers to the counting rods of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams. For *Qian*: one line is thirty-six, two lines seventy-two, and six lines two hundred sixteen. For *Kun*: one line is twenty-four, three lines seventy-two, and six lines one hundred forty-four. Applied to one year, this exhausts the number of three hundred sixty days. Further dividing by the flourishing of the Five Phases: Water, Wood, Fire, and Metal each govern one season, totaling four times seven, or two hundred eighty-eight days. Seventy-two days remain to complete a full cycle. Thus, Earth governs the four seasons, with eighteen days per season corresponding to the months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Additionally, six days each month belong to Earth, aligning with the six lines of a hexagram in a month, demonstrating that the Five Phases cannot be separated from Earth. In all four seasons of the year and all six days of a month, Earth is lodged within them to govern. Therefore, between Heaven and Earth, the myriad people, things, affairs, and transformations all rely upon it as the ground for birth, growth, harvest, and storage—hence the term *hou*.\n\nReaders should appreciate the unceasing effort in contemplation, for it concerns nothing more than the transformations of *jia* and *si*.\n\nMaster Zhang of *Guanwu* states: The four seasons and eight solar terms each undergo three changes, with ten days constituting a *xun*. Three *xun* make a month, nine *xun* a season, and thirty-six *xun* complete the four seasons. Five days make a *hou*. Three *hou* form a *qi*, nine *hou* a solar term, and seventy-two *hou* complete the eight solar terms. Heaven has four seasons; each season has four months, and each month forty days. Four times four is sixteen, but one is subtracted from each, leaving three months per season and thirty days per month. Though the numerical structure is four, one is consistently unused. The operative numbers are three and nine. Thus, three *xun* make a month, and three months—ninety days—make a season. Five days make a *hou*, so one month has six *hou*, and five times six is thirty days. Three *hou* make a *qi*, totaling fifteen days. Nine *hou* make a solar term, and eight times nine *hou* complete the cycle of *qi* and solar terms.\n\nI have long lamented that today’s calendar officials merely record the names of the *hou* without delving into their meanings. Let me enumerate them one by one to prevent them from falling into the realm of what the common people use daily yet remain unaware of.\n\n**The Names and Meanings of the Seventy-Two *Hou***\n\nThe *hou* begins with \"earthworms coil\" in the eleventh month, corresponding to the winter solstice and the first day of the *jiazi* superior epoch. The *hou* \"east wind thaws\" begins with the first month, as the Five Dynasties’ Ma Chongxu’s new calendar prioritized the Rain Water solar term in the first month.\n\n**First Month**\n- *East wind thaws*: The spring wind disperses the cold and frozen *qi*.\n- *Hibernating insects stir*: They begin to move but have not yet emerged; by the second month, they awaken in great alarm.\n- *Fish rise to the ice*: During the height of cold, they lurk beneath the ice, seeking warmth. By the first month, as yang *qi* ascends, they swim near the surface beneath the ice.\n- *Otters sacrifice fish*: At this time, fish are plump and delicious; otters first offer them in sacrifice before eating.\n- *Wild geese arrive*: The great *hong* and lesser *li* return from abroad to China, soon to fly north to their nests.\n\nThe *Tongshu Yan* states: At the Start of Spring, pheasants call and hens lay eggs; at Rain Water, the *tiao* wind descends. The *tiao* wind is the east wind. The *meng* wind is the fiercest of winds.\n\nThe rustling of grasses and trees produces sound, hence called \"the sprouting of grasses and trees.\" This marks the season for plowing.\n\nIn the second month, the peach trees begin to blossom, responding to the *Jing Zhen* season. After another five days, the *cang geng* sings, its plumage turning yellow. It is also called *huang li liu*, or *wu huang*. In *Shang Geng*, it is known as the *chu que*; in Qi, people call it *bo shu*. Today, it is named the *bu gu*, as its call resembles *bo shu*. The *hong jiu* and *gu hong* are among its names. The hawk transforms into the turtledove, and by autumn, the turtledove reverts to a hawk.\n\nThe *xuan* is the swallow. It is also called the *yi* bird, arriving when life flourishes. It nests in the eaves of houses to breed, symbolizing marriage—thus, in ancient times, *Shang Jian Di* swallowed an egg and gave birth to *Qi*. Yang lies trapped within yin and cannot emerge; when it strikes forth, thunder resounds. The sound of yang is thunder, while its light is lightning. Yang is external, and yin clings to it, thus flashing and forming lightning. It is also said: lightning is the light of yang, and when yang is weak, its light is unseen. As yang gradually strengthens and strikes yin, its light becomes visible—hence, it is called the \"beginning of lightning.\"\n\nIn the third month, the paulownia begins to blossom. The field mouse transforms into the *jia*—the cuckoo. Another account states: the *mu wu* mouse, a creature of yin, transforms into the *jia* when yang *qi* prevails. When yin *qi* dominates, the *jia* reverts to a mouse.\n\nThe rainbow is called *fu lian*. The bright and vivid one is the male rainbow; the faint and subdued one is the female rainbow. The rainbow is the *qi* of yin and yang in union. When pure yin overcomes yang, the rainbow does not appear. If clouds thin and sunlight breaks through, illuminating raindrops, a rainbow forms.\n\nThe *ping* is floating duckweed. It is also called *ping* or *zao*, a water plant. When the *wu jiu* preens its feathers, silkworms are about to emerge. Its flight and wing-beating urge haste in farming. The *hong jiu*, also called the *que gu*, resembles a small mountain magpie. Dark blue-black with a short tail and many calls, it is thus named the *ming jiu*.\n\nThe *dai sheng* descends upon the mulberry—this is the *zhi wei* bird, also called the *ya jiu*. Its descent upon the mulberry signals that women should attend to their fundamental duties. The *Nei Zai* states: In the second month of spring, the matrons are commanded to tend the mulberry trees, bathe silkworm eggs, and invoke the essence of the *Long Jing*. When the moon aligns with *Da Huo*, the eggs are bathed.\n\nIn the fourth month, the *lou gu* calls—this is the croaking frog. The *Zhou Li*’s *Guo Shi* annotation states: Frogs croak with furious voices when summer *qi* is at its peak. The earthworm, a creature of yin, emerges in response to the pure yang *qi*. The *wang gua* grows red, born of the fire *qi*. The *ku cai* blooms, its bitter taste formed by the fire *qi*. *Mi cao* refers to delicate grasses, their slender stems and leaves giving them this name. By the sixth month of yang, grasses of yin cannot withstand the yang and perish.\n\nIn the fifth month, the *tang lang* is born. It is also called *cheng hao*, or *bu ying*. Its young are called *piao qiao*. In Yan and Zhao, it is eaten as *li*; in Qi and Qi’s east, it is called *ma gu zhe*. Its first call in the seventh month heralds the approach of cold. In the late-cold lands of Bin, it calls in the fifth month.\n\nThe *fan she* is the *bai she*, today called the frog. Its tongue is fixed at the base to the side of its mouth, with the tip curling inward. Some claim to have dissected it and found its tongue curled backward. Zheng disputes this, noting that the *fan she* begins calling in spring and gradually ceases by the fifth month. Its voice frequently shifts, hence the name *fan she*. Alternatively, the frog’s tongue may naturally curl, not necessarily making it the *fan she*.\n\nThe deer, a creature of yin, sheds its antlers in response to yin *qi*—hence, physicians use deer antler velvet to supplement yin. The cicada, also of yin, calls in response. The *ban xia* sprouts—this is the name of a medicinal herb. At the extreme of yin, yang is born.\n\nIn the sixth month, the warm wind begins to arrive, its gentle and abundant *qi* reaching its peak in late summer. The *xi shuai*, also called *can* or *cu shi*, is born in the earth. By late summer, its wings have nearly formed, though it cannot yet fly far, so it dwells in walls. By the seventh month, it flies far into the wild.\n\nWhen the hawk senses the dual yin *qi*, it develops a killing intent and begins to practice striking and grappling.\n\nJiao Wen asks: \"In mid-autumn, the turtledove transforms into a hawk, and in mid-spring, the hawk transforms into a turtledove. Why then does the hawk practice in the sixth month?\"\nZhang Yi answers: \"Though the hawk may become a turtledove, there remain true hawks from which to learn.\"\n\nRotten grass, receiving the *qi* of summer dampness, becomes fireflies. It is not said to \"transform\" because the firefly does not revert to rotten grass.\n\nThe earth, moistened by summer heat, sees frequent heavy rains.\n\nIn the seventh month,\nthe cool wind arrives—this is the sign of cold.\nWhite dew descends—this is the color of metal.\nThe cold cicada calls, attuned to the essence of yin *qi*.\nThe *han tiao*, also called *han xie*, resembles a cicada but is smaller.\nThe azure-red hawk kills the crow, yet dares not taste it first, demonstrating to the people the principle of repaying origins.\nIt further shows: without martial prowess, Heaven and Earth begin to turn solemn, and the grain ripens.\n\nIn the eighth month,\nthe swan-goose arrives.\nIn early spring, it was said to come from without into within; here, it comes from the north to the south.\nThe dark crow returns, marking mid-autumn.\nFrom spring to autumn it returns, retreating to its original nesting place, where flocks of crows prepare provisions.\nThey gather and store fine food, nourishing it well to prepare for winter storage.\nHibernating creatures open their doors when thunder first sounds, and so they seal their doors when thunder’s voice recedes.\nSealing their doors means filling the gaps. They reinforce the four sides of their burrows, narrowing the openings to let in light, for the season remains warm and they must still venture out. Only in the tenth month, when the cold grows severe, do they close them entirely.\nThunder’s voice emerges in the second month amid yang, and recedes in the eighth month amid yin.\nAs yin contracts, waters begin to dry up.\nThe *Guo Yu* states: \"When the Horn of Chen appears, the rains cease; when the Root of Heaven appears, the waters dry.\" The rains cease and the yin path is established; the waters dry and bridges form.\nThe eighth-month lunar lodge aligns with the Pleiades and the Net, which govern rain.\nThe Root of Heaven lies between the chambers of Fang.\nWhen the Horn of Chen appears...\nWhen the Root of Heaven appears at the ninth month’s end, the interval between root and end spans twenty-one days and some remainder.\n\nIn the ninth month,\nthe swan-goose arrives as a guest. It is said that those arriving in mid-autumn are hosts, while those arriving in late autumn are guests.\nAlternatively, those arriving in mid-autumn depart, while those arriving in late autumn remain as visitors.\nThe *wei* bird, entering deep waters, transforms into clams—this is the \"flying transformation into concealment.\"\nThe chrysanthemum blooms with yellow flowers. Its color alone is noted, for its blossoms respond to the height of yin.\nI say: the five yin cannot strip away the one yang, so it expresses its beauty as flowers.\nThe dhole offers sacrifice to Heaven, then hunts and eats its prey.\nIn early autumn, the hawk sacrifices the crow—flying creatures are small, and their transformations swift.\nIn late autumn, the dhole sacrifices beasts—running creatures are large, and their transformations slow.\nGrasses and trees yellow and fall, returning to their roots.\nHibernating creatures all bow low, their heads facing downward to follow the yang *qi* now within.\n\nIn the tenth month,\nwaters begin to freeze.\nFrom the descent of frost in late autumn to this point, ice begins to form—walking on frost, solid ice follows.\nThe earth begins to freeze; when water ices, the ground freezes.\nThus it is known that the pheasant enters deep waters to become a *shen*—the great clam is called *shen*, and this is the \"flying transformation into concealment.\"\nThe rainbow hides and is no longer seen.\nIn early spring, yang overcomes yin, so the rainbow first appears.\nIn early winter, yin overcomes yang, so the rainbow hides and is no longer seen.\nHeaven’s *qi* ascends: in the fifth month, the first yin is born.\nHeaven’s *qi* ascends, and by the tenth month, the six yin have all risen, while the six yang have faded.\nThe celestial body resides above, and yang returns to emptiness.\nThus it is said: \"Heaven’s *qi* ascends; earth’s *qi*, with the six yin below, takes charge.\" Hence it is said: \"descends.\"\nThe closing and sealing that form winter occur as yang *qi* hides beneath the earth, and yin *qi* seals and solidifies to create winter.\n\nIn the eleventh month,\nthe magpie does not call, for the crow of Yan cries at night seeking dawn—it is a yin creature yearning for yang.\nThus, sensing the first yang, it falls silent.\nThe tiger begins to mate, for it too is a yin creature responding to the first yang.\nThe *li* plant sprouts—this is a fragrant herb responding to yang with fragrance.\nThe horse is a yang creature.\nThe earthworm coils, emerging from its burrow with its head bent downward.\nAs yang *qi* stirs, it desires to curl and raise its head, so it knots and bends.\nThe elk sheds its antlers: the deer is a yang creature, and at the summer solstice, receiving the first yin, it sheds its antlers. The elk is a yin creature, and at the winter solstice, receiving the first yang, it sheds its antlers.\nSprings and streams stir—this is the work of Kan, the yang born of Heaven’s One.\n\nIn the twelfth month,\nthe wild goose faces north, turning from south to north.\nThe early ones face north this month; the late ones do so in the second month.\nThe magpie begins to nest, for it knows the year’s position and anticipates the coming year’s *qi*, hence it builds its nest.\nThe early ones do so in the eleventh month.\nThe *Poetry* weft states: \"On the day of return, the magpie begins its nest\"—this is the case.\nThe pheasant crows—it is a fire creature, and sensing yang, it calls.\nThe chicken breeds—it is a wood creature, and clinging to yang, it takes form, hence it breeds at the advent of the Spring Commencement node, for the Spring Commencement lies within this month.\nThe hawk grows fierce and swift, for the season’s killing *qi* reaches its peak, and so the hawk’s ferocity intensifies, seizing birds with speed.\n*Yan* means \"fierce.\"\nThe marshes and lakes freeze to their depths—the ice grows thick within, meaning the depths are solid.\nThis occurs in the lunar lodge of the Dark Dripping Maiden, the Void, and the Rooftop.\nThe earth-ox is brought forth—this is the beginning of labor.\n\nThe month is aligned with *chou* (丑), which corresponds to earth, and earth can overcome water. Thus, the earth-ox is fashioned to dispel the cold *qi* and prevent the yin *qi* from harming the coming year.\n\nThese seventy-two seasonal indicators each bear their own significance. Gazing upon the scene stirs reflection, allowing one to lodge laments for the times and the movements of creatures—hence they are recorded here in detail.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"The divisions, solstices, commencements, and closures must be recorded along with the clouds and phenomena as a precaution.\" The *divisions* refer to the spring and autumn equinoxes; the *solstices*, to the summer and winter solstices; the *commencements*, to the beginnings of spring and summer; and the *closures*, to the beginnings of autumn and winter.\n\nKong Yingda of the Tang remarked: \"The two solstices mark the beginning and end of yin and yang; the two equinoxes, the convergence of yin and yang. These are the greatest of the seasonal nodes.\" Thus, the ancients observed the clouds and phenomena at the two solstices and two equinoxes. *Phenomena* here refers to color.\n\nThe *Baozhang* official states: \"By discerning the colors of the five clouds and phenomena, one may distinguish good fortune, misfortune, floods, and droughts. The portents of abundance and famine are revealed as follows: green signifies insects, white signifies mourning, red signifies warfare and famine, black signifies floods, and yellow signifies abundance. All are discerned from the colors of the clouds beside the sun, verifying the portents and knowing the twelve phenomena’s corresponding regions. The lands upon which these portents descend will experience abundance or famine.\"\n\nThe *Baozhang* official further states: \"By means of the twelve phenomena, one examines the harmony of heaven and earth. Wind is *qi*.\" In ancient times, the twelve pitch-pipes were blown to gauge the *qi* of the twelve earthly branches, distinguishing omens of good and ill. Today, the method of blowing the pitch-pipes has been lost, and thus its Way has perished.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* records: When the Chu army attacked Zheng, Music Master Kuang said, \"Five times the song of the north wind was played, and again the song of the south wind. The south wind was weak and full of deathly tones—Chu will achieve nothing.\" My humble observation: Music Master Kuang blew the pitch-pipes to assess Chu’s strength. The north wind corresponds to *wuyi* and *jiazhong* in the north; the south wind, to *guxi*. Since the south wind was weak, he knew Chu would fail.\n\nWang Zhaoyu said: \"The twelve winds arise from the positions of the twelve earthly branches. The six *qi* of heaven and earth combine to generate wind. *Zhen* produces the *ming shu* wind; *li*, the *jing* wind; *dui*, the *yan he* wind; *kan*, the *guang mo* wind—these are the winds of the four cardinal hexagrams. *Gen* produces the *tiao* wind (also called the *tiao* wind at the beginning of spring); *xun*, the *qing ming* wind (also called the *qing ming* wind at the beginning of summer); *kun*, the *dong* wind (also called the *liang* wind at the beginning of autumn); *qian*, the *bu zhou* wind (also called the *bu zhou* wind at the beginning of winter)—these are the winds of the four intercardinal hexagrams. Including the four commencements, the eight hexagrams yield twelve winds.\" The eight winds govern the eight hexagrams.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Dance is used to enact the eight winds.\" It also says: \"The twelve winds correspond to the twelve pitch-pipes.\" On the day of a military campaign, the pitch-pipes are blown to harmonize the sounds. By observing the enemy, one knows good or ill fortune; by hearing the sounds, one predicts victory or defeat. Further details appear in the later discussion on blowing the pitch-pipes.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Heaven and earth are but a single *qi*. At the outset of generation, it is the *qi* of spring. When it grows to excess, it becomes summer; when it contracts, autumn; when it recedes, winter. The next year, it begins again with spring. Benevolence and righteousness are like yin and yang; the four beginnings, like the four seasons. Dividing the four seasons and four beginnings yields the eight nodes. It is but a single *qi* undergoing growth and decline. One divides into two, two into four, three times four into twelve, twice twelve into twenty-four, three times twenty-four into seventy-two. Scattered, they become ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—nothing more than heaven’s three and earth’s two.\"\n\nThe sounds of the pitch-pipes are appended.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *qi* of heaven all rises from within the earth. This *qi*’s ascent and descent should be divided into six. From the first layer below the winter solstice, it begins to generate; by the fourth month, the six yang are complete and begin to wane, while the yin *qi* below begins to arise. The pitch-pipes correspond to the visible signs of the *qi* and seasons. The Grand Music Master oversees the six *lü* and six *tong*. The six *lü* correspond to the yang sounds; the six *tong*, to the yin sounds. The yin and yang of sound each have their correspondences.\"\n\n*Huangzhong* is the *qi* of *zi*, established in the eleventh month, with its celestial branch in *Xingji*. *Dalü* is the *qi* of *chou*, established in the twelfth month, with its celestial branch in *Xuangan*. *Taicou* is the *qi* of *yin*, established in the first month, with its celestial branch in *Yuezi*. *Yingzhong* is the *qi* of *hai*, established in the tenth month, with its celestial branch in *Ximu*.\n\nFor example, *Taicou* governs the *qian* palace, the second yang sound, and is paired with the nine-two of *qian*. The *kun* palace corresponds to *Yingzhong* six-three—these yang *lü* and yin *lü* all take yang as primary, with yin coming to pair with it. The same applies thereafter. Thus, *jiazhong* is established in *mao*; *wuyi*, in *xu*; *guxi* and *nanlü*, in *chen* and *you*, descending through the lodges of *Jiao*, *Dahuo*, *Shouxing*, and *Daliang*, intertwining further.\n\nThe establishment in *si* is *zhonglü*; in *shen*, *yize*; in *wu* and *wei*, *ruibin* and *linzhong*—these are the pipes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh months, with their celestial branches in *Shichen*. The stars of *Chunshou* and *Weihuo* intertwine and pair to circulate their *qi*. The stars weave through the twelve lodges, the pitch-pipes correspond to the twelve months, and together they harmonize heaven and humanity. First, the *qi* is distributed within the four seasons to assist the sage-king in positioning heaven and earth, establishing the ultimate of central harmony.\n\nIt is also said: \"The three systems are as follows: establishing *yin* is the human system; establishing *chou*, the earth system; establishing *zi*, the heavenly system. The heavenly system is the *Huangzhong* pitch-pipe, nine inches long, the number of *qian*. The earth system is the *Linzhong* pitch-pipe, six inches long, the number of *kun*. The human system is the *Taicou* pitch-pipe, eight inches long, the number of the eight trigrams. The three pitch-pipes have no remaining fractions. *Linzhong* occupies the *wei* position, where the *qi* of *Huangzhong* is exhausted. At *Linzhong*, the pattern of heaven and earth becomes manifest; by *si* in the southeast, it achieves full expression, with no remaining fractions.\"\n\nThe pitch-pipes take the yin and yang of nine and six as their method. At nine times nine, eighty-one, the system of one epoch is complete and its pattern fully revealed.\n\nMoreover, accumulating nineteen years—seven intercalary months—brings the great pattern to full completion, with no remaining fractions. Thus the sage kings of the Three Dynasties established these three pitch-pipes as the beginnings of the year, aligning them with the celestial cycles, terrestrial transformations, and human affairs. That later ages adopted the Xia calendar as the standard was because human harmony elicits the harmony of heaven and earth in response.\n\nThe Three Palaces are: *Yuanzhong*, the Celestial Palace; *Hanzhong*, the Terrestrial Palace; and *Huangzhong*, the Human Palace. *Yuanzhong* is *Jiazhong*. It arises from the *qi* of the *Fang* and *Xin* constellations, known as the Great Star, the Bright Hall of the Celestial Emperor—hence the Celestial Palace. As a yin tone derived from a yang pitch-pipe, sacrifices to heaven employ four tones, excluding *Huang*, *Cou*, *Gu*, and the like.\n\n*Hanzhong* is *Linzhong*. It arises from the *qi* of *wei*, occupying the *kun* position, where the Celestial Altar and Earthly Spirits reside. Located beyond the *Dongjing* and *Yugui* constellations, it is called the Terrestrial Palace. Sacrifices to earth employ four tones: *Lin*, *Cou*, *Dalü*, *Gu*, and the like.\n\n*Huangzhong* arises from *zi*. Above *zi* lies the *qi* of *Xu* and *Wei*, governing ancestral temples—hence the Human Palace. Sacrifices to ancestral temples employ four tones: *Huang*, *Cou*, *Yingzhong*, *Dalü*, and the like. These three serve as palaces for the sacrificial rites of heaven, earth, and humanity, each generating *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu* tones from their respective palaces, sought through the classification of sounds.\n\nIt is further said: The pitch-pipes and their harmonics await the *qi* without discrepancy. The pitch-pipes are also called *zhong*. *Zhong* means \"center\" and \"resonance.\" Resonance refers to the blowing of ashes. Each pitch-pipe’s bore is nine *fen* in circumference, with an inner diameter of three *fen*. The *Huangzhong* tube is buried at the *zi* position, nine *cun* above the ground, its head facing south. From its orientation and position, all other pitch-pipes can be fully deduced. The ashes are made from the pith of reeds from Henan. The tubes are crafted from bamboo of Jinyang’s Jinmen Mountain.\n\nThe twelve pitch-pipes are buried in a secluded chamber, aligned with the four seasons’ positions: *zi* to *si* and *wu* to *hai* represent the great yin and yang. The six yin and six yang intervals constitute the lesser yin and yang. According to Jing Fang’s twelve pitch-pipes: five pitch-pipes occupy their proper positions, each generating five \"children\"—*Huang*, *Tai*, *Gu*, *Lin*, *Nan*. When yang resides in yang and yin in yin, they occupy their proper positions. Five times five makes twenty-five, plus the original five, totaling thirty.\n\nThose that lose their positions generate three \"children\"—also five pitch-pipes: *Dajia*, *Zhonglü*, *Yize*, *Wu*. When yang resides in yin and yin in yang, they lose their positions. Three times five makes fifteen, plus the original five, totaling twenty. Combining two with three yields fifty positions. Some neither lose nor gain their positions, generating four \"children.\" These reside at the junctures of yin and yang. Two times four makes eight, plus the original two, totaling ten. Ten added to fifty makes sixty.\n\nFurthermore, *Huangzhong*, *Taicou*, and the like—seven pitch-pipes—each govern a day as its palace. The remaining fifty-three pitch-pipes follow the days they generate. Six times seven equals forty-two, which governs the days of one cycle. The twelve pitch-pipes generate twelve modes. According to Jing Fang’s method: one pitch-pipe yields five tones, twelve pitch-pipes yield sixty tones, and sixty pitch-pipes further generate three hundred sixty sounds, corresponding to the days of one year.\n\nAlternatively, taking twelve pitch-pipes, each yields seven tones. Each tone forms one mode, totaling eighty-four modes. Modes serve to harmonize sounds. As the *Huainanzi* states: The three hundred sixty pitch-pipes each take the monthly pitch-pipe as their mother, with one solar term as their child. They follow the established day and celestial stem as their divisions, aligning with the seven tones to determine the established day. The sound of the winter solstice—five tones and seven tones—harmonizes therein. Within it, distinctions between primary and secondary tones exist.\n\nOne pitch-pipe generates five tones. For example, *Huangzhong* belongs to *zi*, and *zi* has five: *jiazi* as *zhi*, *bingzi* as *yu*, *wuzi* as *gong*, *gengzi* as *jiao*, and *renzhi* as *shang*—these are the five tones of *Huangzhong*. *Dalü* likewise has five: *yichou*, *dingchou*, *jichou*, *xinchou*, *guichou*—five tones, following the same pattern. The remaining pitch-pipes, from *mao* to *hai*, are all thus.\n\nMaster Zhu further states: There are twelve pitch-pipes in total, each taking its own pitch-pipe as the *gong* tone and generating four tones. For instance, if *Huangzhong* is *gong*, then *Taicou* is *shang*, *Guxi* is *jiao*, *Linzhong* is *zhi*, and *Nanlü* is *yu*—these are the tones of *Huangzhong*’s one *jun*. If *Linzhong* is *gong*, then *Nanlü* is *shang*, *Yingzhong* is *jiao*, *Dacou* is *zhi*, and *Guxi* is *yu*—these are the tones of *Linzhong*’s one *gong*. Each of the twelve palaces establishes its own *gong* tone and generates four tones, completing the sixty pitch-pipes’ tones.\n\nIt is not that *Huangzhong* is fixed as *gong*, *Taicou* as *shang*, *Guxi* as *jiao*, *Linzhong* as *zhi*, and *Nanlü* as *yu*. Rather, *Huang*, *Tai*, *Dajia*, *Gu*, *Zhonglü*, *Rui*, *Lin*, *Yize*, *Nan*, *Wu*, *Ying*—these form the sequence of the twelve pitch-pipes’ lengths. In *Huangzhong*’s one *jun*, the generation of tones—whether ascending or descending—follows the proper order, so each employs the full pitch-pipe’s primary tone. The remaining sixty pitch-pipes each complete one day’s five tones in sequence. On their respective days, each serves as *gong*, rotating through *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.\n\nMaster Zhu further discusses the method of generating rotating *gong* tones: For example, if *Dalü* is *gong*, it uses *Huangzhong*’s number of eighty-one, reducing it by one-third to generate *Yize* below. *Yize* then uses *Linzhong*’s number of fifty-four, increasing it by one-third to generate *Jiazhong* above. The rest follow this pattern. The numbers of the pitch-pipes and harmonics: *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *mao* belong to yang and generate above, governing growth—hence \"increase by one-third.\" *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *you* belong to yin and generate below, governing decay—hence \"reduce by one-third.\" Yang generates yin below, long tubes generate short tubes. Reducing by one-third shortens them. Yin generates yang above, short tubes generate long tubes. Increasing by one-third lengthens them. For example, *Huangzhong* is nine *cun*; dividing nine into three parts and combining two yields six *cun*, which is the generation below.\n\nThe *Linzhong* pipe, corresponding to the sixth month, takes the length of the *Lin* pipe in *cun*, divides it into three parts, and adds two to six to yield eight *cun*, thus generating above. The *Taicu* pipe, corresponding to the first month, follows the same pattern for the remaining pitch-pipes.\n\nCounting by the standard numbers: nine nines are eighty-one, the *gong* tone. Dividing it into three parts and removing one yields twenty-seven, which then becomes fifty-four, the *zhi* tone. Adding eighteen to fifty-four yields seventy-two, the *shang* tone. Within this, removing one part of twenty-four yields forty-eight, the *yu* tone. Adding one part of sixteen to it yields sixty-four, the *jiao* tone. These numbers of the five tones, derived through the method of \"reducing and increasing by one-third,\" all arise naturally.\n\nThe pitch-pipes (*lü*) proceed left while the harmonics (*lü*) proceed right, their courses differing like the method of divination. From *Huangzhong* to *Zhonglü*, all generate below. From *zi* to *si*, yang ascends and yin recedes. Thus, when a pitch-pipe generates a harmonic, it is called \"generating below,\" and when a harmonic generates a pitch-pipe, it is called \"generating above.\" From *Rui Bin* to *Yingzhong*, all generate above. From *wu* to *hai*, yin ascends and yang recedes. Thus, when a pitch-pipe generates a harmonic, it is called \"generating above,\" and when a harmonic generates a pitch-pipe, it is called \"generating below.\" At *wu*, the pattern changes, so *Yi Bin* generates above again. The methods of Jing Fang, Ma Rong, and Zheng Xuan all follow this principle. Ban Gu arranged them in descending order. The *Jiazhong* pipe, at three *cun* and seven *fen* with a fraction, is too short to correspond to the first or second month. As spring embodies the qi of growth and nurturing, Zheng Xuan takes yang’s generation as ascent. But where does descending yang reside? It is better to discuss this through the method of divination: *Qian* (乾), *jia* (甲), and *ren* (壬) proceed left, while *Kun* (坤), *yi* (乙), and *gui* (癸) proceed right. The six yin and six yang follow their courses, and the true nature of *Rui Bin* is the seventh note. Generating above to *Dalü* yields *zhi*, generating below to *Yize* yields *shang*. Generating above to *Jiazhong* yields *yu*, generating below to *Wuyi* yields *jiao*.\n\nUsing the sixty pitch-pipes and sixty hexagrams, from *Huangzhong* proceeding left to *Zhishi* is \"generating above,\" while from *Linzhong* proceeding right to *Chishi* is \"generating below.\" The sixty hexagrams: *Qian* is aligned with *zi* and proceeds left, *Kun* is aligned with *wei* and proceeds right, *Zhun* is aligned with *chou* and the *wenshi* interval and proceeds left, *Meng* is aligned with *yin* and the *wenshi* interval and proceeds right, *Tai* is aligned with *yin* and proceeds left, *Pi* is aligned with *shen* and proceeds right, and *Xiaoguo* is aligned with *wei* and proceeds right. Seven hexagrams proceed in alternating directions, and the pitch-pipes empirically validate this. For a quicker method, one need not look beyond *Qian* and *Kun*, the six yang and six yin. *Zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu*—*Huang*, *Tai*, *Gu*, *Mo*, *Yi*, and *Wu*—follow *Qian*’s leftward rotation, which is called \"pitch-pipes generating below.\" *Wei*, *si*, *mao*, *chou*, *hai*, and *you*—*Lin*, *Zhong*, *Jia*, *Da*, *Ying*, and *Nan*—follow *Kun*’s rightward turn, which is called \"harmonics generating above.\" These are the words of Zheng Xuan’s divination method, derived from the *Tai Xuan*.\n\nJing Fang’s method holds that one pitch-pipe contains the variations of the five tones, forming sixty hexagrams, which actually begin with *Zhong Fu*. After seven days, it returns to correspond with the pitch-pipe of the winter solstice, *Huangzhong*. Its true origin lies in *Zhishi*, which precedes the winter solstice—this is the origin of the pitch-pipe and calendar systems. Yang Xiong and Fang Shi understood this. The Northern Asterism does not move, serving as the pivot of the celestial axis. Yet the true immovable point lies at the final degree of the pivot star. Those who are not skilled in observing the heavens cannot grasp this. The numbers of the *gong* tone begin and end here.\n\n\"Huangzhong is the first, Linzhong the second, Taicu the third, Nanlü the fourth, Guxi the fifth, Yingzhong the sixth, Ruibin the seventh, Dalü the eighth, Yize the ninth, Jiazhong the tenth, Wuyi the eleventh, and Zhonglü the twelfth *gong*. Thus, yang descends to generate yin, and yin ascends to generate yang, culminating in Zhonglü, where the twelve pitch-pipes complete their cycle. Ascending generates Huangzhong as *zhi*, descending generates Linzhong as *shang*. Ascending generates Taicu as *yu*, descending generates Nanlü as *jiao*. These twelve *gong* each possess five tones, totaling sixty tones. Nanlü occupies the final position, hence it is said: 'culminating in Nanlü.' It is also said: 'Zhonglü ascends to generate Zhishi, Zhishi descends to generate Qumie. Ascending and descending generate one another, culminating in Nanshi.' Nanshi is Nanlü. Thus it is said: 'culminating in Nanshi, where the sixty pitch-pipes complete their cycle.'\n\nThe Three Powers and Seven Beginnings: The Three Powers begin with Huangzhong for Heaven, Linzhong for Earth, and Taicu for Man. The Seven Beginnings are Guxi for the beginning of spring, Ruibin for summer, Nanlü for autumn, and Yingzhong for winter—these are the Four Beginnings, which together with the Three make Seven. If one uses the two transpositions to adjust the melody, the sounds of winter and summer will be lacking, and the four seasons incomplete. Therefore, each *gong* has five modes, with the addition of the transposed *gong* and transposed *zhi*—two modes—making seven.\n\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* records only the five tones, without mentioning the transpositions of *gong* and *zhi*. The six yang lines of *Qian* generate the six yang pitch-pipes: *Qian*’s initial nine is Huangzhong as *Fu*, the second nine is Dalü as *Lin*, the third nine is Taicu as *Tai*, the fourth nine is Jiazhong as *Zhuang*, the fifth nine is Guxi as *Da You*, and the top nine is Zhonglü as *Qian*. From Huangzhong, the first yang arises in the eleventh month, and the descent of yang generates yin as 'descending generation.' The six yin lines of *Kun* generate the six yin pitch-pipes: *Kun*’s initial six is Ruibin as *Shen*, the second six is Linzhong as *Dun*, the third six is Yize as *Pi*, the fourth six is Nanlü as *Guan*, the fifth six is Wuyi as *Bo*, and the top six is Yingzhong as *Kun*. From Ruibin, the first yin arises in the fifth month, and the descent of yin generates yang, also termed 'descending generation,' though it may also be called 'ascending generation.'\n\nEight eights correspond to the eight winds; same positions represent husband and wife, different positions represent mother and child. Thus it is said: 'The pitch-pipe takes a wife, and the mother gives birth to a child.' The twelve pipes generate one another, all following the pattern of eight eights. Ascending and descending generation exhausts itself in Zhonglü. The mutual generation of yin and yang begins with Huangzhong and proceeds leftward. For example, Huangzhong generates Linzhong, passing through eight celestial stems. This pattern applies to all subsequent generations, all following the method of 'three heavens and two earths.' Three threes make nine, two threes make six. Nine and six embody the Dao of yin and yang, husband and wife, mother and child.\n\nHuangzhong’s initial nine and Linzhong’s initial six both occupy the first position of the first image. Husband and wife are one body, sharing the same position, and together reside in Linzhong, which ascends to generate Taicu. The second nine, second in the first position, represents mother and child generating one another in different positions. Thus it is said: 'What the pitch-pipe generates are husband and wife in the same position; what the *lü* generates are mother and child in different positions.'\n\nBlowing the pitch-pipes reveals matters of good and ill fortune. The Grand Master holds the unison pitch-pipe to listen to the sounds of the army and proclaim good or ill fortune. In the records of King Wu’s military campaigns, it is said: on the day the king led his troops into battle, the soldiers arrayed their ranks, the generals raised their banners, and the Grand Master blew the pitch-pipes to harmonize the sounds. If *shang* prevailed, the battle was won, and the soldiers were strong—this pertains to the west, where metal governs firm decisiveness, hence strength. If *jiao* prevailed, the army was disordered, with many changes and loss of the soldiers’ morale—wood governs bending and straightening, hence disorder. If *gong* prevailed, the army was harmonious, and the soldiers were of one mind—earth governs growth and nurturing, hence harmony. If *zhi* prevailed, the general was hasty and prone to anger—fire governs fierceness and wrath, hence haste. If *yu* prevailed, the troops were weak, lacking awe and clarity—water governs softness and weakness, hence obscurity.\n\nMaster Kuang said: 'I sang the *North Wind*, then sang the *South Wind*. The *South Wind* was not strong, and many died—Chu also achieved nothing.' The *North Wind* refers to Jiazhong and Wuyi to the north; the *South Wind* refers to Guxi and Nanlü to the south. The qi of the southern pitch-pipes did not arrive, hence many deaths—all were discerned by blowing the pitch-pipes and singing the winds. Sound emitted is called song.\n\nMaster Shao said: 'Primal wine is bland and flavorless; grand sound is pure and rare.' At the winter solstice, the first yang sprouts in Huang*gong*, like the brewing of primal wine. Its flavor is hidden in tastelessness—this is the music of no sound. Master Zhou said: 'Music is pure and not excessive.' Purity calms desire, harmony releases restlessness. This is the central sound of Huangzhong, the root of the pitch-pipes, which naturally sighs without *gong* or *shang*.\n\nI once admired Wan Baochang, who, while dining with others, struck a miscellaneous jar with his chopsticks and spontaneously produced musical tones. The gradations of high and low were exquisite—it was only regrettable that no one at the time understood. Su Shi said: 'If the world had no Master Nan Guo, ears would never have heard the earth’s breath—how much less the breath of heaven?' Ouyang Xiu said: 'Instruments may decay, but sound cannot be transmitted through words.' Alas! Sound—can it truly be without transmission? Within the universe, where can one go that is not governed by tone and pitch? They constantly move with the sun and moon, cold and heat, darkness and light, wind and rain, traversing between heaven and earth. From ancient times to the present, from dawn to dusk, the clamor of voices and the resonance of apertures—all are my lofty mountains and flowing waters, my yellow reed pipes and clay drums. Must one await the performance of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo before sound is deemed transmissible?\n\nIt is also said: 'The *lü* resonates with the *lü* to generate sound.' Sound is *lü*, and *lü* is yang. The *lü* has opening and closing; with each opening and closing, myriad sounds arise. Ten sounds correspond to ten pitch-pipes. The ten celestial stems—five are yang, and the five tones are the conjunction of the ten stems. Thus, in the hexagrams, they correspond to *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*; in time, to the primal epoch, kalpa, cycle, and generation; in the pitch-pipes, to the sounds of the sun, moon, and stars.\"\n\nVoices intone tones, and pitch-pipes intone *lü*. Their reckoning distinguishes the Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity. Sound arises from the sun, corresponding to *jia* through *gui*, and initiates the twelve tones below on earth. Of the one hundred sixty sounds, one hundred twelve are employed.\n\n*Lü* resonates with *lü* to generate tone. Tone is *lü*, and *lü* is yin. *Lü* has call and response; with each call and response, myriad tones arise. The twelve tones correspond to the twelve *lü*. Of the twelve earthly branches, six are yin, comprising the six *lü*, which are the conjunction of the twelve cyclical signs. Thus, in the hexagrams, they correspond to *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun*; in time, to the year, month, day, and cyclical hour; in *lü*, to the sounds of water, fire, earth, and stone.\n\nTones harmonize sounds, and *lü* harmonize pitch-pipes. Their reckoning distinguishes the Greater Softness, Lesser Softness, Greater Yin, and Lesser Yin. Tone arises from the cyclical hour, corresponding to *yin* through *chou*, and responds above with ten sounds to heaven. Of the one hundred ninety-two tones, one hundred fifty-two are employed.\n\nMaster Shao’s *lü-lü* system reveals the untransmitted secrets of the Primordial, differing from the *Tai Xuan* and *Tai Chu*. The *Xuan* takes heaven’s three odd numbers as its measure. Three multiplied by three yields nine, forming the three sequences of heaven, earth, and humanity. All commence with the *huangzhong* pitch-pipe, following Fan’s reckoning. Master Shao’s *Jingshi Lü-Lü* takes earth’s four even numbers as its measure. Four multiplied by four yields sixteen, arising from the Two Modes generating the Four Images, following the reckoning of the *Yi*. It divides sound and *lü-lü* by the old and young of yin and yang. Four serves as the body, five and six as function. Five is sound, and six is *lü-lü*. If within the body one distinguishes body and function, then sound is the body, and tone is function. If within function one distinguishes body and function, then *lü-lü* is the body, and sound and tone are function.\n\nThe *Tai Xuan* and *Tai Chu* exclusively take *zi* through *si* as yang pitch-pipes and *wu* through *hai* as yin *lü*. Sound and tone merge into one. Master Shao’s Primordial reckoning exclusively takes the ten celestial stems as yang pitch-pipes and the twelve earthly branches as yin *lü*. Sound and tone correspond to *lü-lü* only when one comprehends the method of three multiplied by three and four multiplied by four, after which the study of *lü-lü* may be mastered. Those who have discoursed on sound from ancient times to the present have conflated them into one path. Only with Master Shao’s teachings does precision emerge.\n\nThose skilled in bell and pitch-pipe discern order and chaos by examining sound. When Kangjie traveled to Longmen Mountain, he rested in a grove of gravel, where a withered branch suddenly fell nearby. He said to Fu Han’gong, “This tree will soon be felled.” On his return journey, he saw the land as far as the eye could reach had been cleared. Upon verification, it was discovered that the capital’s construction had felled it, and his words were confirmed. Other examples, such as the prosperity and decline of peonies or the cuckoo’s call foretelling order and chaos, all belong to the same study. Here, I record a few instances below.\n\nDuring the Han, Cai Yong, styled Bojie, passed through Gaoqian Pavilion in Kuaiji and saw the bamboo eaves of its roof. Sixteen stalks from the eastern side could be made into flutes. Indeed, they produced an extraordinary sound, and the world called them “Keting Flutes.” This is knowing sound by form. He also took scorched paulownia from a traveler’s lodge to fashion the “Jiaowei Zither.” This is knowing sound by movement. A neighbor played the zither, and he observed a mantis stalking a cicada. Listening to the sound, he knew it contained a killing intent. This is knowing a person’s heart by the sound of things.\n\nDuring the Sui, Wan Baochang was profoundly versed in music and told Emperor Wen, “The music established by Zheng Yi is the sound of a fallen state—how could it befit Your Majesty’s ears?” He also once listened to the music performed by the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and wept profusely. When asked why, he did not reply.\n\nHe said: “The music is lewd and fierce, and it bodes mourning for the realm—before long, there will be mutual slaughter.” At the time, the four seas were in full prosperity, and those who heard this all deemed it unlikely. Yet by the end of the Daye era, his words proved true.\n\nThere was a man named Wang Lingyan who, overhearing his son playing the pipa outside the door and performing the tune *Fan Angongzi*, was greatly startled. He asked, “When did this melody first arise?” The son replied, “It has appeared recently.” Lingyan wept and said to his son, “You must not accompany the Emperor on his journey to Jiangdu—the Emperor will never return.” He explained, “This tune is in the *guan* mode, signifying departure without return. That is how I know.” And so it came to pass.\n\nDuring the Tang, Li Sizhen, listening to music, remarked, “The *gong* mode does not summon the *shang*—this betrays a rift between ruler and minister. The *jue* and *zhi* modes are in discord—this foretells estrangement between father and son. The prevalence of deathly, mournful tones suggests that if the state remains at peace, the Crown Prince will bear the blame.” Soon after, the Crown Prince was deposed. Li Sizhen also divined the day of his own death, prepared his coffin and burial clothes, and died as predicted.\n\nIn the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era, Pei Zhigu was present when the ancestral temple music commenced. He said to Yuan Xingchong, “The harmony of bells and chimes is exquisite—does this not portend great fortune for the Tang imperial line?” That very month, Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne.\n\nThere was a man who, upon hearing a horse neigh, declared, “The horse’s cry is mournful—its master will surely fall to his death.” Another, hearing the jingling of a bride’s girdle ornaments, said, “This will end in separation.” Upon inquiry, all such predictions proved accurate. Similarly, Zheng Xiangru’s counsel to Zheng Qian foretold glory and disgrace, success and failure, life and death.\n\nSong Shaochangbo Dou Gongyan could calculate the decay of wooden pillars and accurately foretell the lifespans and fortunes of brothers. Dou Wan was deeply versed in musical temperament; his discernment of sounds allowed him to make such predictions. From this, one may infer that those skilled in divination and prognostication have been numerous since the Qin and Han dynasties, yet only the Song Confucian Master Kangjie attained its subtleties.\n\nHe held that human nature is quiescent, and that extreme stillness gives rise to movement. This movement is yang, not emotion. It is the first manifestation of the heart of Heaven and Earth at the dawn of creation. When a person lies in the womb, it is a time of creation, the initial yang. At birth, the moment of “opening things and accomplishing affairs,” emotion first stirs, and movement becomes visible.\n\nHe arranged two hundred fifty-six positions, calculating from sound. Master Kangjie used two hundred sixty-four characters to encompass the numerical system of *lü* and *lü* tones. Within this, one hundred twelve characters summarized *sheng* (sound), while one hundred fifty-two summarized *yin* (tone). Sound and tone mutually interact through fanqie, yielding seventeen thousand twenty-four distinct sounds. Sound corresponds to rhyme, tone to initials. Sounds are divided into level, rising, departing, and entering tones, while tones are categorized by labial, lingual, dental, molar, and guttural articulation. Sounds distinguish inner and outer, and tones are further refined through eight transformations: opening, developing, gathering, and closing. They are also divided into *pi* (expansion), *qing* (clear), *xi* (contraction), and *zhuo* (turbid). Sounds are represented by trigrams on the left, tones by trigrams on the right. The outer three lines of a hexagram are called *hui* (regret), the inner three *zhen* (constancy). Viewed horizontally, each yields a specific hexagram—these two hexagrams together form *jiji* (already completed), the diagrammatic hexagram. By identifying the hexagram in the *guai* diagram, one determines fortune or misfortune, all calculated from sound. Listening must be precise, without the slightest error.\n\nMaster Yichuan said: “One expansion and one contraction encompass the level, rising, departing, and entering tones. One intonation and one response encompass opening, developing, gathering, and closing. When the level, rising, departing, and entering tones are complete, ten thousand sounds arise. When opening, developing, gathering, and closing are complete, ten thousand tones arise. The *lü* follow Heaven and change; the *lü* follow Earth and transform. Expansion follows yang and emerges; contraction follows yin and withdraws. Intonation follows the firm and ascends; response follows the yielding and descends. Only then do the *lü* and *lü* align with sound, and the Dao of *gong*, *zhi*, *yu*, *jue*, and *shang* each attain their proper place.\n\nYang is the sun, fire; yin is the moon, water. The firm is metal, the stars; the yielding is earth, the celestial stems. When the sun, moon, stars, celestial stems, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are in harmony, Heaven and Earth are rectified. The sun is the eye, fire, color; the moon is the ear, water, sound; the stars are the nose, metal, qi; the celestial stems are the tongue, earth, taste. When the eye, ear, mouth, and nose—color, sound, qi, and taste—are rectified, the human Dao is rectified. Thus, to understand the Dao of *lü*, *lü*, and sound is to be able to conduct the affairs of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. The mutual resonance of *lü* and *lü* gives rise to sound, through which the emotions of Heaven, Earth, and all things are revealed.” Thus concludes the tenth scroll of *Tian Yuan Fa Wei*.\n\n**Scroll Eleven of *Tian Yuan Fa Wei*: *Tian Yuan Fa Wei Xu Wei***\n\n[Corrections per *Siku Quanshu* edition: #16 \"續\" emended from \"績\"; #17 \"冰\" emended from \"水\"; #18 \"牟無\" emended from \"鵪母一\"; #19 \"陽\" emended from \"陰\"; #20–21 \"虹\" emended from \"蜺\"; #22 \"鴉\" retained (variant: \"鷗\"); #23 \"二\" supplied; #24 \"始\" supplied; #25 \"冰\" emended from \"水\"; #26 \"鴉\" retained; #27 \"陽\" emended from \"陰\"; #28 \"猛\" emended from \"猶\"; #29 \"物\" emended from \"色\"; #30 \"辰在\" emended from \"在辰\"; #31 \"後\" emended from \"厚\"; #32 \"本\" (variant: \"根本\"); #33 \"度\" emended from \"加\"; #34–35 \"太\" emended from \"大\"; #36 \"變徵\" emended from \"歡變\"; #37 \"將張兮\" (variant: \"將弓矢\"); #38 \"南風\" emended from \"北風\"; #39 \"故\" emended from \"時\"; #40 \"太\" emended from \"大\"; #41 \"傍\" (variant: \"前\"); #42 \"之\" and \"乃\" supplied; #43 \"治亂\" supplied; #44 \"胞\" (variant: \"胎\"); #45–46 \"姆\" (variant: \"母\"); #47 \"一\" (variant: \"二\"); #48 \"為\" supplied after \"名.\"]\n\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; Collated by Fang Hui Wugu and Wan Li.*\n\nThe Hexagram-Qi System\n\nThe hexagram-qi system originates with *Zhong Fu* (Hexagram of Inner Truth). Jing Fang transmitted it from Jiao Gan, who received it from a recluse. It states that the four cardinal hexagrams govern the four directions, serving as regional overseers. The hexagrams *Kan* (Water), *Li* (Fire), *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Dui* (Lake) correspond to the solstices and equinoxes—days when the qi of the four seasons holds sway: wood in spring, fire in summer, metal in autumn, and water in winter. Each hexagram governs its season, and divination on its designated day reveals auspicious or inauspicious omens. The remaining sixty-four hexagrams and their lines each govern a single day, totaling three hundred and sixty days. The remaining five and a quarter days are divided into eighty parts per day, beginning at midnight, so that five days comprise four hundred parts, and the quarter-day is further divided into twenty parts. The sixty hexagrams are apportioned such that forty-two hexagrams each receive seven parts. The *Bo* hexagram (Stripping), where yang qi is exhausted, falls at the end of the ninth month, and the tenth month is governed solely by *Kun* (Earth). *Kun* spans six days and seven parts; when *Kun* is exhausted, the *Fu* hexagram (Return) brings the return of yang qi. From the exhaustion of *Bo* to the return of yang in *Fu*, *Kun* intervenes with six days and seven parts. Rounded to whole numbers, this is referred to as \"seven days.\" In my humble opinion, when speaking of monthly hexagrams, *Bo* to *Fu* spans *Kun*; when speaking of seasonal hexagrams, each month contains five hexagrams. The above is recorded in the *Yi Wei Tu* (Diagrams of the *Weft* Texts of the *Book of Changes*).\n\nJing Fang’s transmission designates the waxing and waning hexagrams as rulers: waxing hexagrams are called *Tai Yin* (Great Yin), waning hexagrams *Tai Yang* (Great Yang), and the rest are termed *Shao Yin* (Lesser Yin) and *Shao Yang* (Lesser Yang). Cai Shi of Xishan remarked: Shao Yong also employed the six-day-seven-part system, and Yang Xiong adapted it to compose the *Tai Xuan* (Supreme Mystery). The *Tai Xuan* omits *Kan*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*, while the *Jing Shi* (Sovereign Generations) omits *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Both exclude the four cardinal hexagrams, adhering to the sixty-hexagram, six-day-seven-part system. Zixia said: \"When the six positions are exhausted, they revert to *Fu* within *Kun*; the number is seven.\" The seventh line begins at the first position, hence the term \"seven days.\" Hu Anding stated: Traversing six lines, each line represents a day, so the sixty hexagrams and their lines correspond to three hundred and sixty days. The interval between any two hexagrams is seven days. Moreover, some hexagrams take a line as a year, others as a month, and others as a day. The phrase \"seven days\" clarifies the hexagram-qi system. In terms of waxing and waning, from the *Li Dong* (Beginning of Winter) solar term in the tenth month to the *Da Xue* (Great Snow) solar term in the eleventh month, *Kun* transitions to *Fu*, spanning nearly seven days. The explanations of all scholars trace back to Zixia. The Confucians of the two Han dynasties transmitted the Classics using the six-day-seven-part system. By the Song dynasty, Wang Zhaosu, Wang Kui, and Song Xian began to write treatises refuting it.\n\nZhaosu argued: The commentaries and sub-commentaries both contradict the Master’s meaning. Even in the tenth month, when *Kun* is pure, yang qi still resides within. Thus, the *Qimai* (Millet) Master’s *Kun* hexagram’s top line speaks of \"dragons battling.\" If *Kun* were exhausted after six days and seven parts, then at the end of the tenth month, a single yang would immediately occupy its position, leaving fifteen days until the winter solstice. This demonstrates the difficulty of applying the seven-day principle to the numerical system of the *Yi Wei*. Hu Dan challenged this, saying: In the Western Han, Jing Fang’s hexagram-qi governance consistently proved accurate. In the Eastern Han, Lang Dian’s six-day-seven-part theory was the most refined. The six-day-seven-part system is the actual count of hexagrams and lines, while the days of the year are a nominal count. The remaining days of the month are calculated and added as intercalary days. Zhaosu failed to grasp the subtlety of intercalation, hence his doubt about the fifteen-day gap before the winter solstice. It is regrettable that the *Weft* texts have been lost, and Jing Fang and Lang Dian’s teachings have perished.\n\nZhu Zifa remarked: Zhaosu only understood the general outline. How could he comprehend that the four cardinal hexagrams govern the four directions, while the sixty hexagrams govern the days of a full year? The solar terms are all regulated by the four cardinal hexagrams, leaving five days and a quarter, which accumulate to form intercalary days. Each hexagram spans six days and seven parts, with the advance and retreat of qi propelling the cycle. For example, in the ninth month, *Bo* is followed by *Gen* (Mountain), *Ji Ji* (After Completion), *Shi He* (Biting Through), and *Da Guo* (Great Exceeding), totaling five hexagrams before *Kun* is complete. In the tenth month, *Wei Ji* (Before Completion), *Jian* (Obstruction), *Yi* (Nourishment), and *Zhong Fu* (Inner Truth) precede *Fu*, again five hexagrams. Thirty days separate *Bo* and *Fu*, with *Fu* governing the winter solstice. The mid-point qi of the winter solstice begins with *Zhong Fu*, and seven days after *Zhong Fu*, *Fu* arrives. Thus it is said: \"This is the movement of Heaven.\" Among the scholars of past dynasties, only the *Xuan* (Mystery) grasped its essence. Hence: *Xuan* is one, *Zhong* (Center) is two, *Xian* (Surplus) is three, *Cong* (Compliance) is four, *Geng* (Renewal) is five, *Mou* (Gaze) is six, *Kuo* (Vastness) is seven, *Han* (Shout) is eight, *Chen* (Submersion) is nine, forming the central image.\n\n*Zhong Fu* corresponds to the winter solstice solar term, when the sun rises at one degree of the *Niu* (Ox) constellation, and the Dipper points to *Zi* (North). The pitch-standard *Huang Zhong* (Yellow Bell) governs the eleventh month of the Xia calendar. The Zhou dynasty entered the *Niu* constellation at five degrees. The Zhou symbol *seven-five-one-return* (七五一复) signifies the seven-day return of yang qi. From Yang Xiong, Ma Rong, Zheng Xuan, Song, Yu, Lu, and Fan, all transmitted this learning, yet Zhaosu opposed it—what could be done? Wang Kui had already refuted Kong Yingda’s interpretation of Wang Bi’s commentary, and Song Xian further denounced Jing Fang, Lang Dian, and Guan Lang for appropriating the *Book of Changes* to practice *Ren Dun* (Six Ren), divination, incantations, and yin-yang numerology, which deviate from the Sage’s intent. Why not simply assign each hexagram to a month and each line to a day? Why does the qi not arise from other hexagrams but uniquely from *Zhong Fu*?\n\nZhu Shi countered: Kong Yingda and Wang Bi’s *Yi Wei* waxing-and-waning hexagrams cannot be dismissed. *Liu Ren* (Six Ren) divination aligns times and days with the *Kan* and *Li* hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*. *Dun Jia* (Hidden Jia) divides the nine palaces according to the *He Tu* (Yellow River Diagram), both capturing one aspect of the *Book of Changes* but not its entirety. He further argued: Scholars who invoke *Ren Dun* to explain the *Book of Changes* seek to encompass all under heaven, unaware that *Ren Dun* actually derives from the *Book of Changes*. Why, then, should those who expound the *Book of Changes* rely on *Ren Dun*?\n\nThe sage deduced the principles of yin-yang waxing and waning to illuminate the images of gain and loss, survival and demise. Those who trust in the advance and retreat of hardness and softness yet reject the *Xiao Xi* (Waxing and Waning) learning of the *Yi Wei* (Apocrypha of the *Book of Changes*), claiming that hexagram qi does not arise from *Zhong Fu*, are like those who count all day yet know not of two and five—how can they be deemed skilled at reading books?\n\nOn the winter solstice of the *yimao* year in the *Yuanzhen* reign (1295), Master Fang of Xugu sent me a letter, stating: \"Zhu Zifa posits that the winter solstice begins at the first degree of *Niu* (Ox) Mansion—this is an ancient method. In the third year of Emperor Wen of Han (177 BCE), the winter solstice fell on the twenty-second degree of *Niu*. By the first year of the *Xingyuan* reign of Tang (784 CE), it had shifted to the ninth degree of *Dou* (Dipper). Over 961 years, it regressed twelve degrees. Now, in the first year of *Yuanzhen* (1295), on the seventh day of the eleventh month, the winter solstice falls on the eighth degree of *Ji* (Winnowing Basket), having regressed another twelve degrees. Five days after the solstice, it lies at the third degree of *Dou*. How can one still cling to the old saying that the winter solstice enters *Niu* Mansion to symbolize the return of the Zhou?\"\n\nI replied: \"Examining antiquity, it is difficult to find complete uniformity. The *Calendar* states that in the time of Yao, the winter solstice fell on the first degree of *Xu* (Emptiness), yet He Chengtian claimed it was on the tenth degree of *Nü* (Woman). The *Yuangai Calendar* of the Song placed the solstice at the seventeenth degree of *Dou*, while the *Monthly Ordinances Essential Meaning* placed it at the fourteenth degree. The *Dayan Calendar* of the Tang’s *Kaiyuan* era set it at the tenth degree of *Dou*, and by the Song’s *Tongyuan Calendar*, it had shifted to the second degree. Moreover, ancient calendars marked the start of the day at midnight, yet Cui Zhongrong took the beginning of *zi* (midnight) as the start of the month, resulting in a two-*ke* discrepancy—yet even then, his precision was acknowledged.\n\nFor yin and yang qi, uneven and irregular, surge and recede to form a year. Their expansion and contraction, advance and retreat, naturally follow this pattern, shifting only within the bounds of *Ji*, *Dou*, *Niu*, and *Nü*. The *Tai Xuan*’s claim that entering *Niu* Mansion symbolizes return derives from the *Tai Chu* calendar. It speaks of what was empirically validated at the time, approximating the general reckoning as a standard. Though later developments diverged, their foundation remains the same—I dare not dismiss them lightly.\"\n\nZhu Xi said: \"A skilled calendar-maker must establish broad, flexible parameters to encompass all—this is indeed correct.\" As for the theory of \"six days and seven fen,\" the various scholars have debated it thoroughly—what need is there to belabor it further?\n\nThe *Xiang* (Image) of *Ge* (Revolution) states: \"Fire within the marsh—*Ge*. The noble person, in accordance with this, regulates the calendar and clarifies the seasons.\" Zhu Zifa said: \"The winter solstice begins at the first degree of *Qianniu* (Ox Leader), proceeding rightward through the twelve stations, completing at the twenty-sixth degree of *Dou*, then returning to the first degree of *Qianniu*—thus the calendar is renewed. *Qianniu* is the fire position, *Xingji* (Star Marker) the water position; the sun and moon conjoin here, forming the image of fire within the marsh. This is the origin of the *Tai Chu* calendar’s epoch, corresponding in hexagram qi to the third month. The *Tai Xuan* aligns with this, renewing the historian’s daily reckoning. It occupies the forty-ninth position in the sequence of hexagrams, matching the nodal point of the *Tai Yan* (Great Expansion) number, and the sixtieth, aligning with the degrees of the celestial circuit.\n\nThe sixty hexagrams and 360 lines, each line governing a day. The upper canon begins with *Qian* at *jiazi*, *Tai* at *jiaxu*, *Shi* at *jiashen*, and concludes at *Li*, thirty hexagrams encompassing 180 days, exhausting the three *jia*. The lower canon begins with *Xian* at *jiawu*, *Sun* at *jiachen*, *Zhen* at *jiayin*, and ends at *Jie* at *guihai*, likewise thirty hexagrams spanning 180 days to complete a year. Thus, Jing and Jiao used them to determine daily nodes, calling them 'heaven-and-earth nodes.' The four seasons achieve revolution—this is also called 'heaven-and-earth revolution.' The four seasons are thus established, or unified in a single Dao of nodal division.\n\nThe subsequent hexagrams—*Zhong Fu*, *Xiao Guo*, and *Ji Ji*—serve to divide the *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* hexagrams, corresponding to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Doubling the four seasons yields the eight nodes, marking the solstices, equinoxes, and the beginnings and closings of the seasons. Each line governs fifteen days, aligning with the seventy-two seasonal markers.\n\nFormer scholars claimed that hexagrams begin with *Zhong Fu*—this is incorrect. *Zhong Fu* begins at *jiazi*. *Qian* in the eleventh month starts at *jiazi*, with yang qi culminating at *si* and ending its node. Ten hexagrams yield *guihai* in the tenth month—here, yin is born at *wu*, culminating at *hai* to conclude the reckoning of a year.\n\nNow, it is also said that *Zhong Fu* corresponds to the eleventh month, beginning at *jiazi* and concluding at *Wei Ji*—this is because hexagram qi all arise from the mid-month qi of the preceding month. The *Tai Xuan* aligns *Zhong Fu* with the initial six of *Kan*, corresponding to the eleventh month. The mid-month qi begins to stir, resonating with the *Shang Yuan* (Upper Origin). The *Tai Chu* calendar takes the new moon and winter solstice of the eleventh month as the origin of reckoning, the head of calendar computation.\n\n*Zhong Fu* (upper *Xun*, lower *Dui*), *Xiao Guo* (upper *Zhen*, lower *Gen*), and *Ji Ji* (embodying the forms of *Kan* and *Li*) constitute the six children. The qi of lesser yang and lesser yin, the six children, distribute across the four seasons to complete a year’s seasonal markers.\"\n\nShaozi said: \"Luo Xiahong reformed the *Zhuan* calendar into the *Tai Chu* calendar, and Yang Xiong modeled the *Tai Xuan* upon the *Tai Chu* calendar. Every sixth hexagram, qi arises from the center. Thus, the first hexagram combines three celestial and two terrestrial numbers—though not the true celestial and terrestrial numbers, it approximates them.\n\nKangjie said: \"Does the *Tai Xuan* not grasp the heart of heaven and earth? The heart is where *Kun*’s extremity generates *Qian*, beginning at the time of the winter solstice—this is the origin of pitch standards and calendars. Its profound and far-reaching insights harmonize with the divine to this extent.\" Thus, his poem reads: \"Were it not for Yangzi’s learning of heaven and man, how could there be Zhuangzi’s inner and outer chapters?\"\n\nWhen the first yang stirs and the myriad things are yet unborn, the sage perceives the heart of heaven and earth in this. Hexagrams begin with *Zhong Fu*, responding in seven days. Its central emptiness images the heart, resonating with the Han *Tai Chu* calendar.\n\nThe *Zhuan Emperor’s Calendar* takes the tenth month as its beginning, while the *Lianshan* Classic begins with *Gen*. Ziyun’s *Tai Xuan* comprises eighty-one chapters, each with nine eulogies, totaling seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies. These eulogies are the *yao*. Two eulogies correspond to one day, each eulogy governing six hours; one hour yields six *ce*, so one eulogy yields thirty-six *ce*, aligning with the *yao* of the sixty hexagrams’ qi. Each hexagram spans six and seven-sevenths days, while each *Tai Xuan* chapter spans four and a half days. One chapter of four and a half days leaves a remainder, but two chapters of nine days balance evenly. Yin chapters take yin numbers as their basis, while yang chapters take yang numbers. The number five resides between two and four—five is earth. One, two, three, and four, the generating numbers, precede five; six, seven, eight, and nine, the completing numbers, follow it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"*Tai Xuan* entirely follows Jiao Yanshou’s method of deriving hexagram qi.\" The explanations of Jiao’s school differ. In King Wen’s eight trigrams, *Qian* lies in the northwest, with twelve hexagrams in the southeast; *Kun* lies in the southwest, with twelve hexagrams in the northwest—their positions are entirely distinct. The *Yi*’s trigrams—*Zhen* in the east, *Dui* in the west, *Li* in the south, and *Kan* in the north—form one system, while the twelve sovereign hexagrams assigned to the twelve earthly branches form another. When Jiao Yanshou devised his method of hexagram qi governing days, he merged the two into one. He not only used the eight trigrams’ *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*—with their twenty-four *yao* governing days and hours—but also assigned the twelve sovereign hexagrams to the twelve months. Further dividing them into forty-eight hexagrams, corresponding to dukes, marquises, ministers, and grandees, the theory of \"six days and seven parts\" emerged. *Tai Xuan* models itself on hexagram qi, taking *Zhong Fu* as the beginning of the winter solstice and *Yi*’s top *yao* as the end of *Da Xue*. *Tai Xuan* also takes the center as the inception of yang qi, the start of the winter solstice. *Yang* contains the two eulogies *Qi* and *Ying*, marking the end of *Da Xue*. All follow the sequence of the *Yi*’s hexagram qi but alter their names. Hexagram qi employs *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* to govern the twenty-four qi. *Tai Xuan*, however, begins with the center, multiplies by four and then six, to govern the twenty-four qi. In its selection of numbers, it fundamentally follows the *River Chart*: one and six share a lineage, two and seven form a fellowship, three and eight become companions, four and nine follow the same path, and five and ten guard one another—thus uniting the generating and completing numbers. To approximate this, the symbols of robes and garments are derived from three and eight...\n\nThe might of halberds and spears derives from four and nine; the system of ruler and minister, from two and seven; the sacrifices to spirits and gods, from one and six; the nourishment of wine and food, from five and five—yet five is unspoken, for five times five makes ten.\n\nIt is further said: Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan* is entirely modeled on the *Yi*. While the *Yi* employs the number four, he uses the number three throughout. Since he originally imitated the *Yi*, one may glimpse its meaning by examining the very phrases he imitates. Where the *Tai Xuan* aligns with the *Yi*: *Zhou* corresponds to *Fu*, *Tong* to *Meng*, *Zeng* to *Yi*, *Jiao* to *Tai*, and *Yi* to *Yang*. All these names are drawn from the *Yi*’s hexagrams. Sometimes one section matches one hexagram, or two or three sections match a single hexagram—thus clarifying the method of minute divisions.\n\n*Xuan Chong* is the sequence of hexagrams; *Xuan Cuo*, the miscellaneous hexagrams; *Xuan Shu*, the commentary on the hexagrams; *Xuan Wen*, the *Wen Yan*. The *Xi Ci*’s exposition on the *Tui Ying Kang Tu* is its proclamation—all modeled on the *Yi*. The *Yi* begins with one generating two, two generating four, four expanding to eight, and eight times eight yielding sixty-four, where it halts. The *Tai Xuan* begins with one generating three, three generating nine, and nine times nine yielding eighty-one, where it halts. The *Yi* has six lines: metal, wood, water, and fire form one division, the upper line another. Six times six produces sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines. The *Tai Xuan* has nine eulogies, dividing the generation of metal, wood, water, and fire. These become eight, and with earth’s guarding of one, form nine. Nine times nine extends to seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies, where it is complete. Both the *Yi* and the *Tai Xuan* share the same Five Phases.\n\nThe *Yi* multiplies two by four, four by eight, eight by sixty-four, and sixty-four by three hundred eighty-four—rooted in the *River Chart*’s celestial three multiplied by earth’s four. Thus, four is the body of earth, while heaven employs the number three. This is why Fuxi doubled three lines into six to form a hexagram. The numbers of the *Tai Xuan* arise from the pitch of *Huang Zhong*: a nine-inch hollow with a nine-fen circumference. Tripling one yields the Three Powers; tripling heaven’s three yields the Nine Categories; tripling earth’s four yields the twelve sovereign hexagrams; tripling heaven’s five yields the fifteen days of one qi; tripling earth’s six yields the eighteen changes that form a hexagram.\n\n*Huang Zhong* begins at *zi*, heaven’s one. Tripling *zi*’s one yields three at *chou*; tripling *chou*’s three yields nine at *yin*; tripling *yin*’s nine yields twenty-seven at *mao*; tripling *mao*’s twenty-seven yields eighty-one at *chen*; tripling *chen*’s eighty-one yields two hundred forty-three at *si*; tripling *si*’s two hundred forty-three yields seven hundred twenty-nine at *wu*. From *wu* through *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai*—the five celestial stems—it reaches one hundred seventy-seven thousand one hundred forty-seven. This is the number of Jing Fang’s sixty pitch-standards, as recorded in the annotations of the *Treatise on Pitch Standards and Calendars* in the Eastern and Western *Han Histories*.\n\nThe *Tai Xuan*’s three hundred sixty-five days, each multiplied by eighty-one, yield twenty-nine thousand five hundred sixty-five parts. Adding one-fourth of a day—twenty parts and a fraction—makes twenty-nine thousand five hundred eighty-five parts and a fraction. Every eulogy and every qi aligns precisely in calculation. Thus it is said: \"Below they drink, above they drink, issuing and entering the nine voids.\" The *Xuan* is the chief of spirits.\n\nIt is also said: Ziyun (Yang Xiong) was a man of deep thought, who would withdraw to ponder. Like the subtleties of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, he simply sought to deduce them. Zhang Heng praised its profound Dao. Its numbers enable one to debate matters of yin and yang—a book of the Han dynasty’s two hundred years, comparable to the Five Classics.\n\nFor example: \"The sun’s path errs; yin and yang alternate in succession. Death and life intertwine; the ten thousand things are thus entangled.\" This speaks of the bright phase’s birth and the dim phase’s death, the dim phase’s death and the bright phase’s birth—death and life passing one to the other, the ten thousand things entwined and accomplished.\n\nOr: \"Examine the patterns of dragon and tiger; observe the principles of tortoise and bird. Establish heaven’s warp as yin and yang; establish earth’s weft as vertical and horizontal; establish human conduct as darkness and light.\" This means heaven is the warp, earth the weft; south and north are the warp, east and west the weft. The division between darkness and light, worthiness and foolishness, lies therein.\n\nOr: \"One day and one night make a full day; one yin and one yang generate the ten thousand things.\" This refers to summer’s sixty *ke* of daylight and winter’s sixty *ke* of night. No night is longer than the winter solstice, no day longer than the summer solstice. The winter solstice’s night does not surpass the summer solstice’s day, hence the day’s count is greater.\n\nOr: \"Nothing generates yang like *zi*; nothing generates yin like *wu*. In the northwest, *zi*’s beauty is exhausted; in the southeast, *wu*’s beauty is exhausted.\" This means yang begins at *zi* and ends at *wu*, yin begins at *wu* and ends at *zi*. The southwest still holds a trace of yang, hence in the northwest its beauty is exhausted. The northeast still holds a trace of yin, hence in the southeast its beauty reaches its peak.\n\nAs for the Way of yang being ever abundant and the Way of yin ever deficient, this means yang is fully employed while yin is half used. \"South and north fix position; east and west circulate qi.\" That *zi* and *wu* fix position refers to the storehouses of yin and yang. When east’s wood flourishes, west’s metal dies—qi responds and communicates.\n\nIn its discussion of the sun and moon, it says: \"The sun has south and north; without south and north, there would be no winter and summer. The moon has going and coming; without going and coming, there would be no new and full moons.\" The sage observes the changes of concealment and exposure, and regulates the sequence of the sun and moon’s male and female.\n\nThe sun reaches its southernmost point at *Niu* (Ox) and its northernmost at *Dongjing* (Eastern Well). The south is the Greater Yang; the north is the Greater Yin. When yang essence reaches the Greater Yang, it is summer; when yin essence reaches the Greater Yin, it is winter. At dusk, the moon appears in the west as *tiao* (exposure); at dawn, it appears in the east as *ce ni* (concealment)—the rest is seen in the *Greater Yang* chapter.\n\nIn its discussion of the numbers of yin and yang, it states: *Zi* and *wu* are nine; *chou* and *wei* are eight; *yin* and *shen* are seven; *mao* and *you* are six; *chen* and *xu* are five; *si* and *hai* are four. Thus, the forty-two *lü* and thirty-six *lü* (pitch standards) alternate or not, totaling seventy-eight. *Jia* and *ji* are nine; *yi* and *geng* are eight; *bing* and *xin* are seven; *ding* and *ren* are six; *wu* and *gui* are five. Sound arises from the sun; *lü* arises from the celestial stems. Sound is based on essence and substance; *lü* harmonizes with sound. When sound and *lü* align, the eight tones arise. The Yellow Bell begins at *zi*, as *Qian*’s first yang line starts with nine. *Wu* is the palace of *zi*, hence both are nine. The months from *zi* to *si* correspond to those from *wu* to *hai*. The numbers four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine are divided: *jia* and *ji* pair with *zi* as nine; *yi* and *geng* follow *chou* as eight; *bing* and *xin* follow *yin* as seven; the numbers six and five follow likewise. Yang *lü* are nine, seven, and five, doubled to make forty-two. Yin *lü* are eight, six, and four, doubled to make thirty-six. Combined, they total seventy-eight. At eight, *chou* and *wei* return, obtaining *lü* but not *lü* (pitch standards). The five tones arise from the ten celestial stems: *jia* and *yi* are *jiao* (角); *bing* and *ding* are *zhi* (徵); *geng* and *xin* are *shang* (商); *ren* and *gui* are *yu* (羽). The twelve *lü* arise from the twelve hours, from which they emerge. The eight tones are metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. This is the source of sound and *lü*, the numbers of the Five Phases. Later generations who cite this to discuss Kangjie’s numbers—how could they know its true origin lies here?\n\nThe profound principle: The numbers of the *Tai Xuan* begin with three. *Tai Xuan* is the Supreme Ultimate. It symbolizes the ruler’s position. The three directions are heaven, earth, and humanity, representing the Three Powers. The *Xuan* of heaven, the *Xuan* of earth, and the *Xuan* of humanity. The three directions symbolize the Three Dukes; each direction has three provinces, totaling nine provinces symbolizing the Nine Ministers. Each province has three departments, totaling seventy-two departments symbolizing the grand masters. Heaven’s Way is established as beginning, middle, and end; earth’s Way as upper, middle, and lower; humanity’s Way as contemplating fortune and misfortune.\n\nThe *Yi* divines through change; the *Xuan* divines through penetration. The opening eulogies of the *Xuan* are all based on the Five Phases. From *zhong* (center) to *zhou* (cycle), reaching *yang* (nourishment): *zhong* is one, water; *zhou* is two, fire; *zan* is three, wood; *xian* is four, metal; *shao* is five, earth; *li* is six, water (earth’s six completes water). *Shang* is seven, fire; *gan* is eight, wood; *shi* is nine, metal. The numbers end at nine. From *xian* onward, it begins again as one, water. This pattern continues thereafter. Each of the nine eulogies in a section: the first is water, the second is fire, the third is wood, the fourth is metal, the fifth is earth, the sixth is water again, the seventh is fire, the eighth is wood, and the ninth is metal. In all sections, five is the ruler. The primary line of a section is like the fifth line in a *Yi* hexagram. In the *Xuan*, the first section begins with yang, corresponding to the first section of yin. The eighty-one sections all correspond to one another. Odd sections are yang; even sections are yin. Odd corresponds to odd; even to even. Their governing principles differ and oppose one another.\n\nThe *Xuan*’s sequence states: \"Patrolling the six *jia*, it meets the Dipper.\" This is the great principle of the *Xuan*’s calendrical origins. The *Xuan* has *qi man* (excess), just as the Dipper has intercalary months. The eighty-one sections begin from the center, and each section must indicate the degree of the sun’s entry at the month’s first day, all governed by the Dipper. For time is easily corrected and visible, while the Dipper’s reckoning is obscure and prone to error. When seasonal qi and the Dipper align without discrepancy, intercalation is correct, and the calendar is accurate.\n\nIt also states: \"The *Tai Xuan* measures the sun by day and the Dipper by night,\" omitting the moon, for it constantly waxes to govern the void. The *Xuan* measures the sun by day and the Dipper’s pointer because they are constant and unchanging. The moon waxes and wanes, its size and speed irregular, hence it is not recorded. The degrees of the twenty-eight lodges in the diagram are not the celestial twenty-eight lodges but the positions of seasonal nodes. The degrees of the sun’s entry at the month’s first day and the *Monthly Ordinances*’ solar entries are broadly similar.\n\nThe *Xuan*’s diagram states: \"From *zi* to *chen*, from *chen* to *shen*, from *shen* to *zi*, crowned with *jia*.\" Chapters, sessions, unities, and elements vanish together with lunar eclipses—this is the *Xuan*’s Way. Wu Ji of Yulin annotates: In the first year of the *Taichu* epoch, the first month was *jiazi*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. After 1,539 years, the first month was *jiachen*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. After another 1,539 years, the first month was *jiashen*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. Nineteen years make one *zhang*; twenty-seven *zhang* make 513 years. One *hui* is the completion of the sun and moon’s conjunction. Eighty-one *zhang* make 1,539 years, one *tong*. From *zi* to *chen*, from *chen* to *shen*, totaling 4,617 years make one *yuan*. A *yuan* has three *tong*; a *tong* has three *hui*; a *hui* has twenty-seven *zhang*. Nine *hui* have 243 *zhang*, completing the cycle. Calculating a *yuan*’s numbers with *zhang*, *hui*, and *tong*: when the nine *hui*’s *tong* numbers are exhausted, the cycle ends. One *zhang* exhausts intercalary fractions; one *hui* exhausts lunar eclipses; one *tong* exhausts new moon fractions; one *yuan* exhausts the six *jia*—this is the *Xuan*’s Way.\n\nThe *Xuan* begins at the Celestial Origin, at the first dawn of *jiazi*, when the winter solstice commences at the start of *Qianniu*. From a span of eight *cun* to a single step, it moves ceaselessly. It revolves through 365¼ degrees, thirty days make a month, twelve months make a year. Intercalary months are added to fix the four seasons, completing 365¼ days—yet it does not fully circle. The *Zhuan* calendar falls short by ¾ of a day, while the *Tai Chu* calendar falls short by half a day. The reason it does not fully circle is that yang numbers overflow while yin numbers are deficient. Thus, two surplus measures are added to fulfill the *Xuan*’s numbers and align with celestial degrees—just as intercalary months are added to reconcile the year’s days, thereby enacting the pitch pipes and calendrical reckoning.\n\nI deem that Shao Kangjie’s *Jingshi* calendar, though differing from this, proceeds by analogy to achieve divine subtlety. Master Shao’s *Xiantian* hexagram qi: *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, are apportioned to the four seasons, governing the twenty-four qi. When *Kan* completes its course at the *zi* midpoint, it exchanges with *Li*; its first line marks the winter solstice, its top line the *Jingzhe*. When *Li* completes its course at the *mao* midpoint, it exchanges with *Qian*; its first line marks the spring equinox, its top line the *Mangzhong*. When *Qian* completes its course at the *wu* midpoint, it exchanges with *Kan*; its first line marks the summer solstice, its top line the *Bailu*. When *Kan* completes its course at the *you* midpoint, it exchanges with *Kun*; its first line marks the autumn equinox, its top line the *Daxue*. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each employ sixty-four hexagram qi, all arising from the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* midpoints as the four cardinals—two solstices and two equinoxes. The *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* positions correspond to the four *Meng* and four *Li*. In the *Jingshi* calendar, the winter solstice is the origin of heaven and earth, the origin of origins. Thus, it omits the four cardinal hexagrams and employs three hundred sixty. The *Guqi Tu* takes the spring equinox as the origin of humanity, also the origin of origins. Thus, it employs sixty-four hexagrams, multiplied fourfold to make two hundred fifty-six positions. The *Guqi Tu* takes the *zi* midpoint of the winter solstice as the origin of the world, the *mao* midpoint of the spring equinox as the origin of origins, the *wu* midpoint of the summer solstice as the origin of conjunctions, and the *you* midpoint of the autumn equinox as the origin of revolutions. Each employs sixty-four hexagrams, alternating according to qi and revolution. The inception of affairs and the unfolding of things begin at the *yin* midpoint, commencing at the *Jingzhe*, the second month’s first qi. The closure of things occurs at the *xu* midpoint, concluding at the *Lichun*, the tenth month’s first qi. Why? The *yin* and *xu* midpoints govern monthly conjunctions in name, but in function, they truly depend on the nodal qi. The earth’s generation of things relies on qi as its mechanism. Heaven’s qi arrives first, and only then do earth’s things respond. The qi’s arrival always precedes by half a month. Qi, by its nature, is ever-expansive and thus constantly overflows, while the moon, by its swiftness, is ever-contracting and thus constantly deficient. Thus, Guan Ziming said: \"In the reckoning of appointed times, that which exceeds is called *qi* surplus, while that which falls short is called new moon deficiency.\" The irregularities of *qi* surplus and new moon deficiency accumulate over time, so that the central qi may occasionally fall on the month’s last day. Intercalation is then applied to restore the original alignment.\n\nThe *Jingshi* is rooted in the *Xiantian*, thus its central conjunctions and new moons both arise from hexagram qi. Following the *Xiantian*’s fundamental numbers, it takes the central qi to govern the months. The origins of *yuan*, conjunctions, revolutions, and worlds all begin from the center—this is what is meant by \"establishing the correct from the center.\" The *Guqi Tu* states: \"The great revolution’s method should follow the *Jingshi*, its numbers beginning at *xing*, *jia*, *chen*, *zi*. The lesser revolution’s method should follow the *Guqi Tu*, beginning at *jia*, *si*, *Meng* days.\" Heaven unifies the forms. The form of qi arises from the four midpoints. Thus, the great revolution’s *jiazi* corresponds to the winter solstice, and the heads of the twenty-four qi all attain the four midpoints of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. The function of qi operates through the four *Li*, thus the lesser revolution’s *jiayin* corresponds to the *Lichun*, and the heads of the twenty-four qi all attain the *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* positions, reigning over the four *Meng*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: In the *Xiantian Tu*, the left side begins with the first line of *Zhen* as the winter solstice, the midpoints of *Li* and *Dui* as the spring equinox, and proceeds to the end of *Qian* to exchange with the summer solstice. The right side begins with the first line of *Xun* as the summer solstice, the midpoints of *Kan* and *Gen* as the autumn equinox, and proceeds to the end of *Kun* to exchange with the winter solstice. The diagram’s reversal and progression, left and right, have been detailed by earlier scholars. *Qian* as one, *Dui* as two, *Li* as three, *Zhen* as four—these are the generated hexagrams, their sequence proceeding from south to north. As for the circulation of hexagram qi, it proceeds from north to south. The first yang arises at the beginning of *Zhen*, thus Master Shao takes the *zi* midpoint of the winter solstice as *Fu*. The eleventh month’s midpoint is the *Xiaohan*, its hexagrams *Kan* and *Zhun*. The twelfth month’s *Chuji* is the *Dahan*, its hexagrams *Zhen*, *Shike*, and *Sui*. The first month’s *Yinchu* is the *Lichun*, its hexagrams *Wu Wang* and *Ming Yi*. The month’s midpoint is the *Yushui*, its hexagrams *Gui*, *Ji Ji*, and *Jia Ren*. The second month’s *Maochu* is the *Jingzhe*, its hexagrams *Feng*, *Li*, and *Ge*. The month’s midpoint is the spring equinox, its hexagrams *Tong Ren* and *Lin*. The third month’s *Chenchu* is the *Qingming*, its hexagrams *Sun*, *Jie*, and *Fu*. The month’s midpoint is the *Guyu*, its hexagrams *Mei*, *Kui*, and *Dui*. The *Sichu* of the fourth month is the *Lixia*, its hexagrams *Lü* and *Tai*. The month’s midpoint is the *Xiaoman*, its hexagrams *Da Xu*, *Xu*, and *Xiao Xu*. The *Wuchu* of the fifth month is the *Mangzhong*, its hexagrams *Da Zhuang*, *Da You*, and *Guai*. At the end of *Qian*, it exchanges with the summer solstice, which is the *wu* midpoint. These thirty-two hexagrams belong to yang and correspond to spring and summer.\n\nThe hexagrams *Xun* as five, *Kan* as six, *Gen* as seven, and *Kun* as eight are the ungenerated hexagrams. The diagram proceeds from west to north, but the circulation of hexagram qi begins with the first yin arising at the start of *Xun*, thus the *wu* midpoint of the summer solstice is the beginning. The fifth month’s midpoint is the *Xiazhi*, the sixth month’s *Weichu* is the *Xiaoshu*, its hexagrams *Da Guo*, *Ding*, and *Heng*. The month’s midpoint is the *Dashu*, its hexagrams *Xun*, *Jing*, and *Gu*. The *Shenchu* of the seventh month is the *Liqiu*, its hexagrams *Sheng* and *Song*.\n\nThe month’s midpoint is *Chushu*, its hexagrams *Kun*, *Weiji*, and *Xie*. The eighth month’s *You* beginning is *Bailu*, its hexagrams *Yang*, *Kan*, and *Meng*. The month’s midpoint is the autumn equinox, its hexagrams *Shi* and *Dun*. The ninth month’s *Xu* beginning is *Hanlu*, its hexagrams *Xian*, *Lü*, and *Xiaoguo*. The month’s midpoint is *Shuangjiang*, its hexagrams *Jian*, *Jian*, and *Gen*. The tenth month’s *Hai* beginning is *Lidong*, its hexagrams *Qian* and *Pi*. The month’s midpoint is *Xiaoxue*, its hexagrams *Cui*, *Jin*, and *Yu*. The eleventh month’s *Zi* beginning is *Daxue*, its hexagrams *Guan*, *Bi*, and *Bo*. At the end of *Kun*, it exchanges with the winter solstice, which is the *Zi* midpoint. These thirty-two hexagrams belong to yin and correspond to autumn and winter.\n\nFrom *Zi* to *Si* are *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*. The six yang months have four solar terms: the winter solstice, *Lichun*, the spring equinox, and *Lixia*. From *Wu* to *Hai* are *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. The six yin months also have four solar terms: the summer solstice, *Liqiu*, the autumn equinox, and *Lidong*. One year has eight solar terms. Doubling these yields sixteen hexagrams, with sixteen additional qi. Tripling these yields forty-eight hexagrams, and combining them makes sixty-four, corresponding to one cycle of seasonal qi. Thus time is fixed and the year completed, and the movements of ghosts and spirits bring about transformation.\n\nNow Master Zhu* takes the two solstices and two equinoxes to grasp the essentials; I, in my foolishness, have inferred the details through hexagram qi.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Eleven, concludes.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Twelve\nCompiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated by Fang Hui Wugu of Xu Valley and Wan Li\n\nThe Expansion and Contraction of Yang and Yin\n\nYang expands for six days, also called *qi* expansion. This accounts for the remainder of five and one-quarter days. Yin contracts for six days, also called new moon deficiency. This refers to the six days of lunar emptiness in a short month. Over one year, the total remainder of twelve days is allocated as intercalary months, honoring the supremacy of yang.\n\nThis describes the sun, moon, and five planets all revolving leftward with the heavens. The latter system follows the motions of the guards. It describes the sun, moon, and five planets all revolving rightward against the heavens. If the heavens revolve leftward, the sun and moon also revolve leftward. The sun’s motion falls short of the heavens, and the moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s—this sequence follows principle and is thus correct. Confucians regard this explanation as valid, adhering to the *prior heavens*.\n\nIf the heavens revolve leftward while the sun and moon revolve rightward against them, the sun moves slowly while the moon moves swiftly. Calendar scholars adopt this explanation for *Yi*-based calculations, adhering to the *posterior heavens*. Confucians do not accept this view but provisionally retain both for reference.\n\nThe *Canon of Yao* states: “Three hundred and sixty-six days, with intercalary months to fix the four seasons and complete the year.” The *Book of Documents* commentary says: “From this winter solstice to the next is one cycle. Within this cycle, there are either 366 days or slightly more than 365 days. The heavens and the sun converge above to form one year, comprising twenty-four qi. The interval between two years remains consistent, even when intercalary months occur.”\n\nThe *day divisor* is multiplied by 940 parts to measure the celestial circuit. The remainder beyond the full degrees is one-quarter of a day, for a day is divided into 940 parts. Dividing these into four yields 235 parts, which constitutes one degree. Thus, one-quarter of these parts is obtained.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “In terms of *qi*, there are 360 days; in terms of lunar phases, there are 354 days. Taking the median of *qi* expansion and lunar deficiency, we speak of 360 days. The remaining variations do not exceed six parts.” The *Canon of Yao* uses round numbers, hence “three hundred and sixty-six days.”\n\nHu Shenzhen said: “When reckoning the year by the four seasons, each season has ninety-four days and ninety parts. When reckoning by the six *qi*, each has sixty-six days and sixty parts. When reckoning by the five phases, each has seventy-two days and seventy-two parts. All yield 360 days. The two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* follow the same principle—this is the norm of celestial numbers. Exceeding this is expansion; falling short is contraction.\n\nWhen expanded, the yang path is ever-abundant, so the sun’s circuit of the celestial degrees constitutes one year. Beyond the 360 days, the year consistently has a remainder of slightly more than five days. When contracted, the yin path is ever-deficient, so the moon’s circuit of the celestial degrees constitutes one month, consistently falling short of thirty days. This is why there are short months and why the year has a remainder of slightly more than five days. Accumulated over the years, this yields the so-called eleven-day deficit. The surplus of accumulated years—once every three years, twice every five, and seven times every nineteen years—completes the great pattern of the heavens.\n\nThe sun and moon cannot be without expansion and contraction, and calendar makers cannot avoid discrepancies. Thus, intercalary months are established to stabilize the seasons and complete the year.” The *Supreme Principles Governing the World* also takes 360 as the standard: one *yuan* comprises 360 *yun*, one *hui* comprises 360 *shi*, one *yun* comprises 360 years, one *shi* comprises 360 months, one year comprises 360 days, and one month comprises 360 *chen*. Yang attains 360 through the number six.\n\nMaster Zhang of Hengqu said: “The sun and moon both revolve leftward.” His explanation: “The heavens are exceedingly vigorous, completing one circuit of 365¼ degrees in one day and night. They then exceed this by one degree. The sun’s motion, though swift, is secondary to the heavens. In one day and night, it completes 365¼ degrees, precisely matching the heavens’ advance of one degree, which causes the sun to appear to retreat by one degree. Over two days, the heavens advance two degrees, and the sun retreats two degrees. Accumulating over 365¼ days, the heavens’ excess degrees complete a full cycle, and the sun’s retreating degrees also exhaust their original count, reuniting with the heavens to form one year.\n\nThe moon moves slowly, completing 365¼ degrees in one day and night but falling short of the heavens by slightly more than thirteen degrees.” Master Zhu said: “If one assumes the heavens complete one circuit daily without excess while the sun falls short by one degree, how can the mid-star positions of the four seasons differ? If this were so, what would define the boundaries of the seasons? As days pass like lamps relayed in succession, noon would soon strike the third watch.”\n\nHere, I cite two passages from the *Monthly Ordinances* commentary that clarify the matter; other calendrical works do not explain it thus. If we consider the heavens’ motion internally, they complete only 365¼ degrees. If we consider them externally, they exceed one degree per day. The sun and moon are discussed within the heavens; if observed from the great void, the heavens themselves are not fixed in their former positions.\n\nHe further said: “The sun and moon both begin at *Jiao*. The sun completes one circuit daily, returning to *Jiao*, while the heavens complete one circuit and slightly surpass *Jiao*. This accumulates daily, and after one year, they reunite with the sun.”\n\nIn my humble opinion, the explanations of these two masters reveal that the heavens’ motion exceeds, the moon’s falls short, and only the sun’s motion is correct. Thus, one year is reckoned at 360 days. Master Shao said: “Yang *qi* expands upon 360. In one year, the sun’s reunion with the heavens exceeds five days and 235 parts, constituting *qi* expansion. Each day’s *qi* expansion is 13 parts, 7 *li*, 8 *si*, and 3 *hu*.”\n\nBetween two *lichun* solar terms, there are in total 4,935 parts, which together constitute the excess of five days and 235 parts. Speaking in whole numbers, the heavens exceed by six days. This is the measure by which the sun’s motion falls short of the heavens.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The celestial body is perfectly round, with a circumference of 365¼ degrees. Revolving leftward around the earth, it completes one full circuit each day while surpassing one degree. The sun, attached to the heavens yet slightly slower, also completes one circuit around the earth daily, but in relation to the heavens, it falls short by one degree. Over 365 days and 940/940 of a day—specifically 235 parts—it reunites with the heavens. This is the measure of the sun’s annual motion.”\n\nAccording to Kong’s commentary: “The heavens are the great void, inherently formless; we merely designate the revolving stars as ‘heaven.’ The heavens envelop the earth like the white surrounds the yolk. The stars revolve from east to west, completing one cycle in 365¼ days before returning to their original positions. While the stars turn leftward, the sun moves rightward, also taking 365¼ days to return to its original stellar position. These stars are the twenty-eight lunar lodges, distributed across the four directions, forming the celestial body. Each lodge spans 13 degrees and 402 parts, totaling 365¼ degrees. Whether measured in celestial degrees or annual days, the count remains the same. Yet due to the excess or deficiency of *qi*, there arises the waxing and waning of time.” The preceding explanations have thoroughly addressed this.\n\nIn my humble opinion: If the heavens’ motion were without excess, matching the sun’s, and the moon’s motion without deficiency, also matching the sun’s—if every day they all returned to *Jiao* and every year consisted of exactly 360 days without remainder—then there would be no irregularity in cold and heat, no variation in the size of days and months, no droughts or floods. Were the heavens to impose such rigid uniformity upon humanity, the workings of creation would lose their pattern. How then could the mechanisms of spirits reward virtue and punish vice operate?\n\nHe further said: “Yin *qi* contracts upon 360. Each month’s new moon lacks 441 parts. From *zi* to *chou*, the moon totals 5,292 parts. Together with the deficiency of five days and 592 parts—rounded to six days—this constitutes the measure by which the moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The moon, attached to the heavens, is even slower. Each day, it falls short of the heavens by 13 degrees and 7/19 of a degree. Over 29 days and 499/940 of a day, it reunites with the sun. Twelve such conjunctions yield 348 full days, with an accumulated remainder of 5,988 parts. Divided by the day divisor of 940, this gives six days and a remainder of 348, totaling 354 days and 348/940 of a day. This is the measure of the moon’s annual motion.”\n\nIn my humble analysis: The “7/19 of a degree” means dividing 940 parts into nineteen portions, each portion being 49 parts, 4 *li*, 2 *hao*, 1 *hu*, 5 *si*, 7 *miao*, and 6 *shao*—the daily shortfall by which the moon lags behind the heavens and the sun’s regular motion. Thus, each day, the moon falls short of the sun by 12 degrees and 346 parts. Over 29 days and 499 parts, its accumulated shortfall reaches 365 degrees and 235 parts—the very degrees by which the sun advances. At this point, the sun’s excess precisely completes its full cycle, while the moon’s deficiency is entirely exhausted. They reunite to form one month. Twelve such periods of 29 days yield 348 full days, and twelve accumulations of 499 parts total 5,988. Divided by the day divisor of 940, this results in six days and a remainder of 348.\n\nFor yang is whole while yin is half; yang is ever in excess, yin ever in contraction. The sun’s motion constantly surpasses the moon’s, while the moon’s motion constantly falls short of the sun’s. In one year, intercalary days arise from the *qi* excess and new moon deficiency, totaling 10 days and 827 parts—rounded to twelve days. These are used to establish intercalary months. Every three years, one intercalary month is added, accumulating three sets of 10 days and 827 parts—32 days and 601 parts, or thirty-six days in whole numbers. After five years, a second intercalary month is added, accumulating five sets of 10 days and 827 parts—54 days and 275 parts, or sixty days in whole numbers. Generally, an intercalary month occurs every thirty-two days, though not precisely uniform, the variation is not great. Thus, the sages devised the calendar, redistributing the remainders to compensate for the moon’s shortfall relative to the sun and the sun’s shortfall relative to the heavens. By harmonizing these three cycles into one, over twenty-nine years, the *qi*, new moons, and divisions align perfectly with the celestial timing, leaving no discrepancy even as fine as a hair’s breadth. Human affairs, too, proceed in accord with the seasons.\n\nSomeone asked about the celestial calendar: “The varying lengths of months are already set in the almanac; one need only calculate them. For instance, if the crescent appears on the second day, the preceding month was long; if on the third, it was short. As the dark bird arrives in the second month and departs in the eighth, so too do things follow this pattern.” An elder once said: “The sun and moon meet between the last and first days of the lunar month. On the first evening, the sight is most splendid: as the sun sets, a faint glow lingers, and the moon follows in its descent. By the second day, they are slightly farther apart. After the third day, as the crescent waxes, the distance gradually increases. By the fifteenth day, when the moon is full and opposite the sun, the sun’s swift motion has carried it halfway across the sky.”\n\nThe moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s, yet its retreat also covers half the heavens. From the sixteenth day to the month’s end, the sun’s course fully spans one celestial revolution, while the moon’s shortfall likewise completes one revolution. Thus, the sun advances through its full measure, the moon retreats through its full measure, and they meet again.\n\nMaster Shao said: “A year’s intercalation consists of six yin and six yang phases. Three years yield thirty-six days, hence one intercalary month every three years. Five years yield sixty days, hence two intercalary months every five years. Nineteen years yield two hundred twenty-eight days. Thus, seven intercalary months leave no remainder, and the calendar takes nineteen years as one *zhang*. That seven intercalary months yield two hundred twenty-eight days is the origin of the intercalation method.\n\nThe method of placing intercalary months arises from the irregular motions of the sun and moon. The sun travels one degree of the heavens per day, while the moon travels thirteen degrees and seven nineteenths of a degree per day. The thirteen degrees account for twelve revolutions of the heavens in one year, while the remaining seven nineteenths form the intercalary fraction. Thus, the intercalation method takes seven and nineteen as its basis: multiplying seven by twelve yields eighty-four, the number of months in seven years; multiplying nineteen by twelve yields two hundred twenty-eight, the number of months in nineteen years. Hence, within a year, one takes months; within a day, one takes hours. Then, taking eighty-four as seven parts and two hundred twenty-eight as nineteen parts, beginning from one hour and accumulating to one day yields a remainder of seven parts. Multiplying this by the thirty days in a month yields two hundred ten parts. Twelve months yield two thousand five hundred twenty parts, with every nineteen parts constituting one hour. A year thus contains one hundred thirty-two hours and eleven days, with a remainder of twelve parts. Multiplying this by the nineteen-year cycle yields forty-seven thousand eight hundred eighty parts. Dividing according to the method, each year yields eleven days and a remainder of twelve parts. Over nineteen years, this totals two hundred nine days and a remainder of two hundred twenty-eight parts, which, when converted into the divisions of a day’s twelve hours, equals two hundred ten days. Thus, nineteen years with seven intercalary months leave no remainder.\n\nTo determine the year, set seven parts per year, and when nineteen parts are reached, an intercalary month is added—thus knowing the year to intercalate. Multiplying the twelve months by the number of years yields eighty-four parts per year; when two hundred twenty-eight parts are reached, an intercalary month is added—thus knowing the month to intercalate. To determine the day, set seven intercalary parts per day, and when nineteen parts are reached, one hour of intercalation is gained—thus knowing the day of the intercalary new moon. Multiplying the twelve hours by the number of days yields eighty-four parts; when two hundred twenty-eight parts are reached, one hour of intercalation is gained—thus knowing the time of conjunction.\n\nThe mutual reckoning of seven and nineteen is the rough method of intercalation; the mutual reckoning of eighty-four and two hundred twenty-eight is the precise method. Intercalation originates from odd numbers, accumulating to seven and reaching completion at nineteen. Thus, seven and nineteen, when multiplied or divided by each other, both yield one hundred thirty-three. Since the methods for months and hours are derived by multiplying by twelve, they must also be divided by twelve, yielding two hundred twenty-eight. The parts of one month and the days of one *zhang* are both two hundred ten. Hence, the *Xici* speaks of “returning the odd to the beginning to symbolize intercalation,” while the *Xiantian* uses one hundred thirty-three for the number of days and one hundred five for the number of stars.\n\nIntercalation is fundamentally the odd number of heaven, yet it is sought through the moon. Thus, one knows that yang takes yin as its measure, and yin and yang mutually constitute substance and function. Multiplying two hundred twenty-eight by ten and then doubling it yields forty-five million six hundred thousand—the number of one *yuan* in the *Sifen* calendar.\n\nIt is also said: the sun advances by slowing, the moon retreats by hastening. When the sun and moon meet, half a day is added and half a day is subtracted, forming the intercalary remainder. The sun advances six days in one great revolution, the moon retreats six days in one great revolution—this is the intercalary difference. The heavens rotate leftward, while the sun and moon revolve rightward; their degrees have been explained earlier. The moon completes one revolution of the heavens each month, yet this is merely its apparent motion. Its actual conjunction with the sun occurs in the final day and a half, always trailing behind the sun. Thus, the sun, though slow, is deemed to advance, while the moon, though swift, is deemed to retreat.\n\nThe sun and moon meet every thirty days, though in reality it is twenty-nine and a half days. For the moon’s true period is twenty-nine and a half days, while the sun’s is thirty and a half days, yet both are reckoned as thirty days. Thus, at each conjunction, the sun gains half a day, and the moon loses half a day. The gain of half a day arises because the sun’s yearly course exceeds the moon’s by six days, and an additional six days are added. The loss of half a day arises because the moon’s yearly course falls short of the sun’s by six days, and an additional six days are subtracted. The accumulation of these gains and losses forms the intercalary remainder.\n\nIn one great revolution, the sun and moon advance and retreat by twelve days, yielding one intercalary month every three years and two intercalary months every five years—this is the intercalary difference. Three intercalary months in eight years, four in ten years, five in thirteen years, six in sixteen years, and seven in nineteen years. Extending this reckoning endlessly is called *tong*.\n\nMaster Zi said: “The year is at peace, yet the *nian* is afflicted.” The year is at peace when its reckoning is complete; the *nian* is afflicted when its reckoning is deficient, and intercalation compensates for it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “Intercalation is determined by the central qi. The central qi belongs to its own month; if it falls after the month’s end, that month is to be intercalated.” The Dipper’s pointer indicates the central qi; the positions of the sun and moon, where the Dipper’s pointer lies between two celestial markers, is the place of their conjunction. If there is no central qi, the month is intercalated. As the Dipper’s handle shifts leftward and the sun and moon revolve rightward, the celestial markers and the established months remain in constant alignment.\n\nThe heavens are divided by boundaries, passing through the degrees and minutes of the palaces. Master Wang Yan said: “Using the degrees of the celestial revolution, one allocates them among the twelve palaces.”\n\nThe passage through each celestial palace is marked by specific divisions. One hundred seconds make a minute, and one hundred minutes make a degree. The year completes its cycle in 365 days and a quarter, aligning with the full celestial degrees at the advent of spring. The month completes its cycle in 30 days and a fraction, aligning with the degrees of a single palace at each nodal transition. Degrees serve as boundaries, and the celestial wheel is demarcated by these limits. The sun advances one degree per day, thus requiring 365 days and 25 *ke* to traverse the entire celestial boundary. The moon travels slightly more than twelve degrees—astrologers commonly say thirteen degrees for simplicity. The moon completes one full celestial circuit each month, traversing the entire celestial boundary. A month does not precisely comprise thirty days. With months of varying lengths, two months totaling fifty-nine days complete two full cycles. Generally, the moon completes one celestial circuit in slightly more than twenty-nine and a half days, and two circuits in slightly more than fifty-nine days.\n\nI contend that ancient and modern calendar-makers have merely calculated the boundaries between yin and yang. This is why Confucius did not expound on calendrics but simply said, \"Follow the Xia calendar’s seasons.\" It is also said: The theory of the heavens rotating leftward is akin to a large wheel on the outside with a smaller wheel carrying the sun and moon within. The large wheel turns swiftly, while the small wheel turns slowly. Though both rotate leftward, their differing speeds create the illusion that the sun and moon move rightward. The celestial body and its motion, along with the solar and lunar degrees, should be understood through four wheels for clarity.\n\nNow, envision the large wheel as the heavens revolving externally—what is meant by \"the heavens envelop the earth\"—moving evenly and expansively, covering slightly more than a quarter of the celestial degrees. The smaller wheel carries the sun and moon internally, being smaller than the heavens, thus rotating inwardly and contracting. The moon’s motion lags behind the sun’s by slightly less than a quarter of its degrees. Therefore, the sun falls short of the heavens by one degree, and the moon falls short of the sun by slightly more than twelve degrees. The outer envelops the inner, the outer expansive, the inner contracted. Their speeds and trajectories naturally follow this pattern. Observing this through the four divisions makes it clear.\n\nYears ago, I saw a diagram crafted by my friend Wu Jiuxia that aligned with this understanding. The outermost ring marked the celestial degrees as the celestial body. The second ring showed the heavens beginning at *Jiao*, completing one full revolution each day while advancing one degree past *Jiao*. The third ring depicted the sun also starting at *Jiao*, following the heavens but advancing one degree less per day, returning precisely to *Jiao* without excess. Thus, it falls short of the heavens by one degree. Each day, the sun retreats by one degree, exhausting its full measure. The heavens advance one degree daily, returning to their original position to align with the celestial degrees, completing one cycle. The fourth ring illustrated the moon’s slower motion, falling short of the sun by 12 degrees and 346.5 parts, accumulating to slightly more than twenty-nine days. The moon falls short of the sun’s degrees by 365 degrees and 235 parts, exhausting its full measure before reuniting with the sun, forming one month and twelve conjunctions. Calculating the moon’s deficit to the sun yields 5 days and 592 parts, with new moons, conjunctions, and intercalary adjustments totaling 10 days and 827 parts to establish intercalation. The specifics are not recorded here.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the meaning of Kangjie’s theory of \"concealed intercalation\" and \"manifest intercalation\"? I replied: The details are not easily explained. Briefly, a year consists of 360 days with an excess of 6 days concealed within the six *jia*—each *jia* spanning two months conceals one day. Six *jia* (360 days) conceal six days. \"Manifest intercalation\" refers to the period from *kaiwu* to *biwu*, where seven-tenths are utilized, and three-tenths are discarded at the nodal transitions. Of the original 360 days, 240 are used, yielding 252 days. The intercalary number twelve is manifested beyond the 240 days.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Calendar* discusses the *Tai Chu* calendar of Emperor Zhuanxu and the *Four Divisions Calendar*. Liu Xin later revised it into the *Three Sequences Calendar*, while Yi Xing’s *Great Expansion Calendar* is the most detailed. The astronomical records of the Five Dynasties are also concise and rigorous, yet all these calendars—whether adding 720 or subtracting—remained accurate for only two or three years. Among ancient and modern calendars, only Kangjie’s calendar employed 129,600 parts, hence its precision.\n\nI shall now summarize the calendars of previous dynasties:\n\nThe *Four Divisions Calendar* was created by Emperor Zhuanxu, based on the *Lianshan*’s *Book of Changes* beginning with *Gen*. It derived from the *River Chart*, expanding ten to one hundred, and dividing by four to yield twenty-five, aligning with the celestial degrees’ quarter division. The Qin dynasty used this calendar, designating the tenth month as the first. Emperor Wu of Han later revised it into the *Tai Chu Calendar*.\n\nThe *Tai Chu Calendar* was crafted by Tang Du, Luo Xia Hong, and others during Emperor Wu’s reign. It designated the first month as *yin*, renaming the seventh year of *Yuanfeng* (71 BCE) as the first year of *Tai Chu*, with the year named *Feng Jia She Ti Ge Yin* and the month named *Bi Ju*. The first day was *Jiazi* at midnight, coinciding with the winter solstice. This revision aligned with the *jia* year of Emperor Zhuanxu’s calendar’s inception, matching the auspicious omen of \"linked jades and joined pearls.\" The year was not *jia yin* but the following one.\n\nThe *Three Sequences Calendar* was Liu Xin’s revision of the *Tai Chu Calendar*. Three threes make nine, and nine nines make eighty-one, forming the *Sequence Mother*. *Huang Zhong* marks the celestial sequence’s first *jiazi* beginning, *Lin Zhong* the earthly sequence’s second *jiachen* beginning, and *Tai Cu* the human sequence’s third *jia* middle beginning. Its epoch aligns with the *Tai Chu*’s commencement at *Huang Zhong*’s pitch (see previous *Xuan Tu* annotations).\n\nThe *Tai Xuan Calendar* was created by Yang Xiong of Han, corresponding to the *Yan Tian Chu* and *Zhuan Calendar*. The *Tai Chu* expanded the *Luoshu*’s nine nines, totaling the *Four Divisions*’ numerical essence.\n\nThe *Zhuan Calendar* expands its numbers by ten tens, dividing the *Hetu* into four parts—its core is the \"void center\" number. The *Tai Chu* takes eighty-one as its *ri fa* (day divisor), being nine nines. The *Tai Xuan* takes seventy-two as its *ri fa*, being eight nines. The *Tai Chu* takes thirty-two as its *chao fa* (fractional divisor), being eight fours. The *Tai Xuan* takes thirty-six as its *chao fa*, being nine fours. Comparing the *Xuan* to the *Chu*, dividing by nine and subtracting one second, or adding one to nine, both yield 2,592 seconds. Though their beginnings differ, their ends converge—see *Gua Qi* for details.\n\nThe *Tai Yan Calendar* was created by Tang’s Yi Xing. From Han to Sui, all calendars followed pitch-standards, but Yi Xing relied solely on the *Great Expansion*, rooted in *Gua Qi*. This is the \"void center\" number of the *Hetu*, taking the sum of one-six, two-seven, three-eight, and four-nine from the four directions to symbolize the four seasons. The void center’s five and ten combine to form the *yan mu* (expansion mother), while the old and young of nine-six and seven-eight serve as its application. The line numbers extend to sixty *ce* (counting rods), and the numbers proceed through 420—this is the *Great Expansion*, the pivot of Heaven and Earth. Later creators could not alter it.\n\nThe *Xian De Tong Tian Calendar* was created by Wang Pu of the Five Dynasties. Ouyang Xiu recorded it in his *Astronomical Examination*, establishing it as an independent school. Yang comprises thirty-six *ce*, yin twenty-four *ce*. The union of yin and yang numbers completes transformation, both yielding seventy-two. Doubling this gives 720, doubling again yields 720,000, and once more 72,000,000. When the *yuan* (primary cycle) generates the *yuan* (origin), years, months, days, and hours all align as *jiazi*. The conjunction of the sun, moon, and five planets at *zi* determines excess and deficiency, their mean positions, and the harmony of the seven luminaries.\n\nIn my view, among ancient and modern calendars, none surpass the Han *Tai Chu* and the Tang *Tai Yan*. Both originate from the *Hetu*, while intervening calendars merely adjust them. The six pitch-standards employ the *Luoshu*, beginning with odd numbers. The eight trigrams employ the *Hetu*, beginning with even numbers. Though their applications differ, all follow the *Posterior Heaven* *Yi*. At that time, the *Prior Heaven Diagram* remained hidden and unemerged.\n\nThe *Prior Heaven Calendar* was the foundation of Shao Yong’s *Huang Ji Jing Shi*. Its method derives from the multiplication of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches: the sun as *jia*, the moon as *zi*, the stars as *jiachen* and *zichou*, called the *Four Images*. In grand reckoning, these are termed *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*; in smaller reckoning, years, months, days, and hours. The sun’s *jia* governs one *tong*, the moon’s *zi* twelve; the stars’ *jia* governs 360 *tong*, and the *chen*’s *zi* 4,320. Altogether, thirty-six *jia* are evenly distributed among the twelve *chen*, each *chen* receiving 360.\n\nThe *Prior Heaven Calendar* differs from the *Posterior Heaven Calendar*. Excluding intercalary calculations, one year comprises twelve *hui*, 360 *yun*, 4,320 *shi*, and 129,600 years. This is why Master Zhu highly praised Kangjie’s calendar. I conclude this account of various calendars here.\n\nMaster Cheng also said: \"In calendrical studies, if one grasps the underlying principles, much becomes clear. Only Shao Yaofu established a method for differences at the juncture of mutual influence, unmatched in antiquity or modernity. Yet in seeking the sun and moon’s yang excess and yin deficiency, he erred precisely where precision was most critical.\"\n\n*The Heavenly Origin Explored*, Scroll Twelve, concludes.\n*The Heavenly Origin Explored*, Scroll Thirteen\nCompiled and annotated by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated and proofread by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu\n\nThe Symbolic Forms and Numerical Patterns\n\nThe Yellow River yielded the *Diagram*, and the Eight Trigrams were drawn—thus yin and yang first took form. The Luo River yielded the *Script*, and the Nine Categories were arranged—thus the Five Phases first took number. Form cannot stand without the even; number cannot proceed without the odd. These two may possess each other, but cannot be without each other.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Heaven and Earth merely cannot speak; it is the sage who speaks for them. If Heaven and Earth could speak, one imagines they would say it even better. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Script* are the *Changes* that Heaven and Earth have drawn.\" Fu Xi, gazing above and below, saw that all between Heaven and Earth was the *Changes*. The emergence of the *River Diagram* precisely matched his heart, so he followed it to draw the trigrams. Later generations’ failure to comprehend the study of symbolic forms and numerical patterns had its reasons.\n\nZhu Shiyu of Hanshang said: \"Shang Qu learned from the Master; from Ding Kuan onward, his lineage flowed into Meng Xi and Jing Fang. Even in the Tang, their *Changes* could still be examined. Yixing compiled the *Changes* of these two schools, discussing hexagram qi, the absorption of the celestial stems into the Five Phases, and the like—all derived from the *Great Commentary* of the *Zhou Changes*, the *Appended Remarks*, and the *Discussion of the Trigrams*. Later, Ma [Rong], Zheng [Xuan], Xun [Shuang], and Yu [Fan] each established their own schools, yet they did not stray far from the source of symbolic forms and numerical patterns. In the Wei, Wang Bi and Zhong Hui, though fellow students, entirely discarded the old explanations, mingling them with Lao-Zhuang thought. They prized literary expression alone, no longer tracing back to origins. The Way of Heaven and humanity thus split. The *Great Commentary* states: 'The Yellow River yielded the *Diagram*; the Luo River yielded the *Script*—the sage took them as models.'\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Kong Anguo said the *River Diagram* refers to when Fu Xi ruled the world and a dragon-horse emerged from the Yellow River; he then followed its markings to draw the Eight Trigrams. The *Luo Script* refers to when Yu controlled the floods and a divine turtle bore markings on its back, with numbers up to nine. Yu then arranged them into nine categories.\"\n\nI humbly observe: At the dawn of Heaven and Earth, the Great Harmony was undifferentiated, and symbolic forms and numerical patterns were not yet manifest. These *River Diagram* and *Luo Script* were how Heaven opened the sage’s understanding. The *Analects* says: \"The Yellow River does not yield the *Diagram*.\" The *Changes* says: \"The Yellow River and Luo River yield the *Diagram* and *Script*.\" The *Documents* says: \"The Heavenly Jade and *River Diagram*.\" Thus, the *Diagram* and *Script* are the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth, treasured objects through the ages, not the work of human effort. How could Masters Ma and Ou have further explanations?\n\nYet some indulge in the bizarre and absurd: the *Huainanzi* speaks of cinnabar writings and green diagrams; the *Spring and Autumn* apocrypha speak of nine chapters and six chapters. Gu Yewang took the eighteen characters of \"agricultural use\" and \"reverent use\" from the *Luo Script* as what the divine turtle bore. Ban Gu took the sixty-five characters from \"one\" to \"six extremes\" as the original text of the *Luo Script*. Kong Yingda of the Tang said: \"Heaven’s words are concise and essential; they should not be so verbose and convoluted.\" Only Kong Anguo’s words are most apt, which is why Master Zhu adopted them.\n\nIt further states: \"Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten. The numbers of Heaven are five; the numbers of Earth are five. The five positions interact, each having its pair. The numbers of Heaven total twenty-five; the numbers of Earth total thirty—this is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits operate.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"This is how the Master elucidated the numbers of the *River Diagram*. Its positions: one and six below, two and seven above, three and eight to the left, four and nine to the right. Five at the center is the generating mother; ten next is the generating child. Then one, two, three, four—the positions of the Four Images. Then six, seven, eight, nine—the numbers of the Four Images. The two elders occupy the northwest; the two youths occupy the southwest. Their numbers each interact by category externally. Moreover, the phrase 'each having its pair' encompasses all the numbers of the *River Diagram*.\"\n\nI humbly observe: The numbers of Heaven are the sum of the five odd numbers; the numbers of Earth are the sum of the five even numbers. One pairs with two to make an even; three pairs with four to make an even; five pairs with six to make an even; seven pairs with eight to make an even; nine pairs with ten to make an even. Each follows its odd or even counterpart, pairing like brothers—thus they follow their sequence without disorder. One pairs with six as Water; two pairs with seven as Fire; three pairs with eight as Wood; four pairs with nine as Metal; five pairs with ten as Earth. Each matches yin and yang like husband and wife—thus they unite in harmony without separation.\n\nTen Celestial Stems are likewise: Yang *jia* pairs with yin *yi* as Wood; *jia* departing to pair with *ji* transforms into Earth. Yang *bing* pairs with yin *ding* as Fire; *bing* departing to pair with *xin* transforms into Water. Yang *wu* pairs with yin *ji* as Earth; *wu* departing to pair with *gui* transforms into Fire. Yang *geng* pairs with yin *xin* as Metal; *yi* coming to pair with *geng* transforms into Metal. Yang *ren* pairs with yin *gui* as Water; *ding* coming to pair with *ren* transforms into Wood. All are the doubling of the Five Phases uniting into one. There must be pairing, and within pairing, there is mutual generation and overcoming, similarity and difference—unevenness. This is how the Five Constants—ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, senior and junior—interact with the Five Phases and cannot be separated.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest pairing: one, three, five, seven, nine combine as the numbers of Heaven, yet do not depart from five. Two, four, six, eight, ten combine as the numbers of Earth, yet do not depart from five. The wondrous union of two and five generates humans and all things, totaling fifty-five. Five is the center. Center means change; change means transformation—its Dao is inexhaustible. One changes and six transforms; two transforms and seven changes; three becomes eight; four becomes nine; five becomes ten.\n\nTransformation gives rise to change, and change gives rise to transformation. The interplay of odd and even generates all things—flexion and extension, coming and going—all emerge from the *Hetu* (River Diagram). Within the five numbers of Heaven and Earth, how could they be likened to the later generations’ talk of ghosts and spirits, of transformations and changes, which drifts into absurdity?\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *Hetu* governs the five generating numbers to unify the five completing numbers. The *Luoshu* (Luo Writing) governs the five odd numbers to unify the four even numbers.\" Master Zhu further stated: \"The generating numbers all reside within; the generating is the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. The completing numbers all reside without; the completing is the achievement of Heaven and Earth.\" This saying is most profound.\n\nIn my humble observation: The *Hetu* divides yin and yang by generation and completion. The generating numbers—one, two, three, four, five—belong to yang and reside within. The completing numbers—six, seven, eight, nine, ten—belong to yin and reside without. The generating governs the completing, the inner harmonizes with the outer. The center is the host, while the outer is the guest. This is what is meant by \"the constant of the body, each residing in its proper place.\"\n\nThe *Luoshu* divides yin and yang by odd and even. One, three, seven, and nine occupy the four cardinal positions, paired with the four yang trigrams. Two, four, six, eight, and ten occupy the four diagonal positions, paired with the four yin trigrams. The odd governs the even, the noble oversees the humble. The cardinal is the ruler, while the diagonal is the minister—this is what is meant by \"through the changes of numbers, each resides in its proper place.\"\n\nYet the two diagrams, in their constancy and change, cannot be rigidly confined. In the *Hetu*, young yin and old yang remain unmoving, while young yang resides in the south, corresponding to the *Qian* position, and old yang resides in the west, corresponding to the *Kan* position—this does not align with the sequence of trigram generation. In the *Luoshu*, old yang resides in the south, corresponding to *Qian*, and young yang resides in the west, corresponding to *Kan*—this, in turn, aligns with the sequence of trigram generation. This is what is meant by \"within constancy there is change, within change there is constancy\"—its subtlety is beyond fathoming.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The round is the stars. Could the reckoning of calendrical cycles originate from this?\" The *Tang Treatise on Astronomy* states in its \"Discussion on Calendar Origins\": \"The numbers of Heaven begin with one, the numbers of Earth begin with two. Combining the two beginnings determines hardness and softness. The numbers of Heaven center on five, the numbers of Earth center on six. Combining the two centers unifies pitch standards and calendrical reckoning. Heaven has five notes to govern the days, Earth has six pitches to govern the hours.\" Master Zhu’s explanation of this is detailed; it need not be repeated here.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Li* is the stars, *Zhen* is the hours. The stars combine with the ten of the sun—ten of the sun is five. The hours are the twelve branches—twelve is six. Five and six nurture the center of yin and yang; the *Scriptures of the Ages* use this to establish the calendar. Nine and ten interact; calculation methods arise from this interval. Thus it has been since the inception of calendrical and celestial observation.\"\n\nThe round is the stars. The *Hetu* lacks those four corners, conforming to its round shape. The numbers of the *Hetu* never fail to align with the numbers of the stars. Zhang said: \"The celestial body’s number is seven, the Northern Dipper has seven stars. The sun, moon, and five planets number seven, and the twenty-eight lunar mansions total four times seven, making seven sevens. Including the six stars of the Southern Dipper, this sums to fifty-five numbers. From this, we know that in the interactions of Heaven, Earth, and human culture, all correspond to the numbers of the *Hetu*.\"\n\nHe further said: \"The square is the earth. The method of dividing land into nine fields may derive from this.\" Master Zhu said: \"A province has nine fields of nine hundred *mu*—this is the method of dividing land into nine fields.\" In my humble observation: The square is the pattern of the *Luoshu*. The earth has four directions; the *Book of Documents* places yang numbers in the four cardinal positions, symbolizing the division of land into well-fields. The *Book of Documents* takes nine as its foundation, also symbolizing the nine hundred *mu* of the well-fields. Heaven bestowed the Nine Categories; Yu received this *Luoshu* while regulating the waters. Thus, he opened the way for distinguishing the nine provinces, assessing the land, determining tribute, and exhaustively applying effort to irrigation channels. Yu accomplished the Nine Achievements, bringing enduring benefit to all under Heaven for myriad generations—from this, we know the greatness of the nine-chaptered *Luoshu*.\n\nHe further said: \"The round is the numbers of the *Hetu*; the square is the pattern of the *Luoshu*. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen relied on them to create the *Yijing*, while Yu and Jizhong used them to compose the *Great Plan*. Numbers begin with one yin and one yang. The image of yang is round, so the *Hetu* is round in form yet square in number. The image of yin is square, so the *Luoshu* is square in form yet round in number. This is what is meant by 'three for Heaven, two for Earth.'\"\n\nThe *Hetu* is ten and square, hence the *Great Commentary* contains the passage on \"fifty-five.\" The *Luoshu* is nine and round, hence the *Great Plan* contains the section on \"Heaven’s bestowal of the Nine Categories.\" In the primordial era, Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, each had their images, but initially, there were no numbers. With the *Hetu*, the fifty-five numbers emerged. The interplay of odd and even, generation and completion, became clearly visible. This is how it profoundly manifests the unique wisdom of the sages.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"One to ten form the *Hetu*; its center is left empty to create the *Yijing*. The *Hetu* is round in form, symbolizing Heaven, and ten and square in number, symbolizing Earth. The yang numbers total twenty-five, the yin numbers thirty, together making fifty-five—thus the even is paired with the odd. Leaving ten empty yields the *Luoshu*’s forty-five. Leaving five empty yields the *Dayan*’s fifty. Accumulating five and ten produces the *Luoshu*’s vertical and horizontal numbers. Multiplying five by ten and ten by five both yield the *Dayan*’s numbers.\"\n\n\"The *Hetu* follows the generating numbers, rotating leftward from north and east: water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water again. Yet, in terms of opposing positions: the north’s one and six (water) overcome the south’s *bing* and *ding* (fire); the west’s four and nine (metal) overcome the east’s *jia* and *yi* (wood). Thus, the overcoming is already latent within the generating.\"\n\nThe ceaseless generation of life is called the *Yi*. When its center is emptied, the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams. Thus it is said: \"One generates two, two generates four, four generates eight.\" The *Hetu* also contains the purport of the *Luoshu*. Between Heaven and Earth, if there were only generation without overcoming, how could generation be accomplished? If there were only overcoming without generation, the human kind would perish. This is why the workings of creation are revealed through the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*.\n\nIt is also said: from one to nine forms the *Luoshu*; filling its center makes it the *Fan*. The *Luoshu* is square in form, resembling Earth, and its numbers total nine, round like Heaven. The yang numbers sum to twenty-five, the yin numbers to twenty, together forty-five—thus the odd exceeds while the even is deficient. When its center is emptied, it is also the Supreme Ultimate. The odd numbers each total twenty, forming the Two Modes. One, two, three, four contain six, seven, eight, nine; their vertical and horizontal sums of fifteen also form the Four Images. The central five, combined with the forty, likewise yields the *Dayan*’s number. Accumulating five and ten gives fifteen, which together form the *Hetu*’s numbers. The *Shu* and the *Tu* mutually complement each other.\n\nThe *Shu* takes the completed numbers, rotating rightward from north and west: water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and water overcomes fire again. Yet, in terms of opposing positions: the southeast’s four and nine (metal) generate the northwest’s one and six (water); the northeast’s three and eight (wood) generate the southwest’s two and seven (fire). Thus, the generating is already latent within the overcoming. Overcoming is the means by which generation is accomplished. That which fills the center is five, which the *Huangji* takes as its foundation.\n\nMaster Kong of the Tang said: The *Huangji* does not speak of numbers because it encompasses the Nine Categories, unifying eight with one and standing at the center of Heaven. The Five Phases, Five Affairs, each five; the Eight Governances, Eight and Five Regulations, five. The *Huangji* alone occupies one and three; virtue three, divination seven, all governance ten, the utmost blessings born of the ultimate—these nine categories, too, encompass the numbers of the *Hetu*.\n\nIt is also said: Both the *Tu* and the *Shu* place five at the center. Five is the number that balances Heaven’s three and Earth’s two. Master Zhu said: The *Hetu* takes the five generating numbers as its essence, and thus the five at its center also embodies the image of the five generating numbers. Its lower point is the image of Heaven’s one, one combining with four. Its left point is the image of Heaven’s three, three combining with eight. Its right point is the image of Earth’s four, four combining with nine. Its central point is the image of Heaven’s five, five combining with ten. The five numbers reside at the center, the generating numbers on the outside, and the completed numbers beyond the generating numbers. One gains five to become six, two gains five to become seven, three gains five to become eight, four gains five to become nine. One, two, three, four generate through five, hence they are called generating numbers. Six, seven, eight, nine are completed through five, hence they are called completed numbers. Though the numbers are paired, they are never without interpenetration. Thus, the *Hetu*’s fifty-five numbers are inherently contained within the five central points.\n\nThe *Luoshu* takes the odd numbers as its essence, and thus the five at its center also embodies the image of the five odd numbers. Its lower point is also the image of Heaven’s one, one paired with two. Its left point is also the image of Heaven’s three, three linked with four. Its central point is also the image of Heaven’s five, five necessarily paired with ten. Its right point is also the image of Heaven’s seven, seven linked with six. Its upper point is the image of Heaven’s nine, nine necessarily paired with eight. The five numbers reside at the center, the odd numbers occupy the cardinal directions, and the even numbers are arranged at the four corners. One gains five to become six at the rear right, two gains five to become seven at the right, three gains five to become eight at the rear left, four gains five to become nine at the front. One, three, seven, nine are the odd numbers derived from five, hence they are called odd numbers. Two, four, six, eight are the even numbers of five, hence they are called even numbers. Though the numbers crisscross vertically and horizontally, each follows its own order without confusion. Thus, the *Luoshu*’s forty-five numbers are also inherently contained within the five central points.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The old and young of yin and yang mutually conceal their abodes. He also said: The numbers seven, eight, nine, and six differ. The *Hetu* positions the numbers one, two, three, four, combining them with the images and numbers of six, seven, eight, nine. Within the forty, five contains five; within the fifteen, five connects to fifty-five—this mutual concealment was elaborated in detail by Dong Panjian. One is the position of old yang, six the number of old yin, yet within one is contained nine, already concealing the number of old yang. Four is the position of old yin, nine the number of old yang, yet within four is contained six, already concealing the number of old yin. The young two is likewise. If yin and yang did not mutually root and conceal their abodes, the mechanism of creation would cease.\n\nMoreover, seven and nine are yang. Yang governs advance: from young yang seven, advancing to the position above eight, it advances to the utmost and becomes old yang, nine, with nowhere further to go. When yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin, hence six and eight are yin. Yin governs retreat: from young yin eight, retreating to the position below seven, it retreats to the utmost and becomes old yin, six, with nowhere further to go. Thus, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born again. The young become old, the old transform, and the young advance once more—this is the inexhaustible mechanism of creation. Yet when yang advances, it is abundant: old yang abounds at eight, young yang at six, and yang numbers are ever full.\n\nYin retreats and thus is deficient: old yin is deficient at seven, young yin at nine, and yin numbers are ever diminishing. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The fullness and emptiness of Heaven and Earth wax and wane with the seasons.\" One who understands this understands the Dao.\n\nIt further states: \"The *Luoshu*’s rows and columns sum to fifteen, alternating in waxing and waning.\" The *Book of Documents* takes one, two, three, and four, containing seven, eight, nine, and six—these are called the yin and yang of the Four Images. From them, the eight trigrams of old and young arise. Their alternation in waxing and waning never departs from seven, eight, nine, and six.\n\nMaster Shao cited the *Commentary on the Changes*, saying: \"Zhen initiates growth, Qian divides, Xun diminishes, Kun contracts.\" This speaks to the general principle of waxing and waning. Thus, Zhen begins by uniting with yin to generate yang, reaching Qian’s nine where yang ages. Xun begins by diminishing yang to generate yin, reaching Kun’s six where yin ages.\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Seven grows six to nine, then divides eight to diminish nine, contracting at six.\" He also said: \"Yang’s growth proceeds from seven through eight to nine, while old yin’s diminution proceeds from eight through seven to six.\" This broadly describes the waxing and waning of a single qi, designating Zhen and Xun as seven and eight. Yet if one seeks this in the *Luoshu*’s trigram positions, Zhen is instead eight, and Xun occupies nine. Their alternation in waxing and waning is such that one plus five becomes six, alternating with the nine of the south; four plus five becomes nine, alternating with the six of the northeast. When six advances to nine, nine waxes and six wanes; when nine retreats to six, nine wanes in turn and six waxes again. Three plus five becomes eight, alternating with the seven of the west; two plus five becomes seven, alternating with the eight of the northeast. When seven advances to eight, eight waxes and seven wanes; when eight retreats to seven, eight wanes in turn and seven waxes again. Generally, numbers advance to wax and retreat to wane. What waxes retreats and wanes, and what wanes advances and waxes. The numbers of the four cardinal and four diagonal directions, whether counted horizontally or vertically, all sum to fifteen. With the central five as void, the numbers sum to ten in all directions. Dividing into ten parts, Master Zhu said: \"Nine is the remainder of one-tenth, eight of two-tenths, seven of three-tenths, six of four-tenths.\" Interweaving and interlacing, they meet without fail. Such is the union of seven, eight, nine, and six.\n\nSomeone asked Master Zhu: \"The *Hetu* does not resemble the trigrams—why did Fuxi follow it to draw the trigrams?\" In my humble opinion, the *Great Commentary* states: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams.\" This is how the Master elucidated Fuxi’s use of the *Hetu* to draw the eight trigrams. That the Supreme Ultimate is said to be \"possessed by the *Changes*\" refers to the five and ten concealed within the *Hetu*, the image of the central palace. That it \"generates the Two Modes\" refers to one, three, seven, and nine as the yang mode, and two, four, six, and eight as the yin mode. That it \"generates the Four Images\" refers to one, two, three, and four as the images of generating numbers, containing six, seven, eight, and nine as the images of completing numbers. That it \"generates the eight trigrams\" refers to seven, six, eight, and nine as the trigrams Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan, occupying the four cardinal positions, while one, two, three, and four as the trigrams Gen, Dui, Zhen, and Xun fill the four diagonal gaps. Thus, what Fuxi followed did not depart from a single diagram, yet the modes, images, and trigrams were all complete.\n\nOne is the Supreme Ultimate. Only because it exists does generation occur: one generates two, two generates four, four generates eight, and eight generates sixty-four. Generation is inexhaustible, all arising from this center.\n\nI have also heard from my teacher: \"These words are indeed the foundation of the *Changes*. But how do they function as numbers?\" He replied: \"Do not seek vague explanations—look to the beginning of Heaven and Earth, and the profound essence of the sages’ *Changes* is entirely here. One is the beginning of yang, so the sages took the single yang line to draw Qian as one, written as a single unbroken line. All trigrams belonging to yang are Qian. For example, Zhen is written as one yang over two yin, Kan as two yin over one yang, Gen as two yang over one yin—all take one as their essence. Two is the beginning of yin, so the sages took the double yin line to draw Kun as two, written as two broken lines. All trigrams belonging to yin are Kun. For example, Xun is written as two yang over one yin, Li as one yang over two yin, Dui as one yin over two yang—all take two as their essence. Thus the eight trigrams were drawn. When King Wen doubled them, he merely rearranged the lines above and below. Taking Qian’s one to exchange with Kun, Kun is transformed into Kan and placed in the north. Taking Kun’s two to exchange with Qian, Qian is transformed into Li and placed in the south. Zhen is placed in the east with one yang inside and two yin outside; Dui is placed in the west with two yang inside and one yin outside. The northwest is Qian, with three yang; the southwest is Kun, with three yin. The northeast is Gen, with two yin and one yang; the southeast is Xun, with one yin and two yang. The four cardinal and four diagonal directions are all arranged by the alternation of one and two. Fuxi drew the trigrams of the Earlier Heaven based on the *Hetu*, while King Wen followed Fuxi to expound the *Changes* of the Later Heaven. Yu bestowed the Nine Categories to first regulate the waters, and the earthly way was leveled. Jizi presented the *Great Plan*, beginning with one water and two fire, and the constant norms were established. All were derived from the numbers of Heaven as one and Earth as two.\"\n\nWithout the *Hetu*, where shall I place my foundation?\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* serve as warp and weft to one another. The eight trigrams and nine categories serve as outer and inner to one another.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Fifty-five is the essence, and the variations of forty-five may be deduced therefrom.\" Taken together, the *Hetu* embodies the image of the Nine Categories, while the *Luoshu* embodies the image of the Five Phases.\n\nThe *Hetu* is the constant number, the *Luoshu* the variable number. The generative numbers govern the completed numbers, serving as the master of the constant numbers. The odd numbers govern the even numbers, serving as the function of the variable numbers. The *Hetu* takes the generative numbers as its master, while the *Luoshu* takes the odd numbers as its master.\n\nThe outer aspect of the *Hetu* may be used to draw the trigrams, while its inner aspect may be used to arrange the Nine Categories. The outer aspect of the *Luoshu* may be used to arrange the Nine Categories, while its inner aspect may be used to draw the trigrams.\n\nThe *Hetu* unites generation and completion to harmonize yin and yang. Though united, they are never without distinction; thus, in its inner and outer patterns, there is a differentiation between host and guest. The *Luoshu* divides odd and even to distinguish yin and yang. Though divided, they are never without union; thus, within their mutual opposition, there is the subtlety of flowing transformation.\n\nWhen it speaks of \"warp and weft,\" it does not mean that above and below are the warp and left and right the weft. Rather, the warp refers to what is constant, while the weft refers to what is variable. When it speaks of \"outer and inner,\" it does not mean that this is the inner and that the outer. Rather, it means that within the *Tu* there is the *Shu*, and within the *Shu* there is the *Tu*.\n\nThe *Tu* and *Shu* mutually serve as constant and variable, depending on what is taken as primary. If the *Tu* is taken as the basis, then the *Tu* is the constant and the *Shu* the variable. If the *Shu* is taken as the basis, then the *Shu* is the constant and the *Tu* the variable. The same applies to outer and inner.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"In the numbers and positions of the *Tu* and *Shu*, three are the same while two differ.\" In the *Hetu*, one and six (water) reside in the north; two and seven (fire) in the south; three and eight (wood) in the east; four and nine (metal) in the west; five and ten (earth) in the center. These five each occupy their proper directional positions. This is the essence of the numbers, yet there is also variation therein. The *Luoshu* serves to convey this variation.\n\nIn the *Luoshu*, the positions of earth, water, and wood remain the same and do not change, for heaven-five resides in the center, generating earth as the Great Ultimate. When it first moves and emerges in the north, it becomes heaven-one generating water. When it emerges again in the east, it becomes heaven-three generating wood. This is the yang qi, which lies dormant in winter and germinates in spring. Its essence cannot be altered; it extends its roots and sprouts, speaking in terms of the inner generative numbers.\n\nAs for two and seven, which originally occupy the southern position of fire, when the season enters summer, then Qian metal generates the yang of Si, residing in the height of summer to nurture the myriad things, expanding its generative power. This is like a king emerging to preside over the Bright Hall, wielding great governance. Thus, the lesser yang of Xun and Kan, generated from two and seven, cannot but yield to the dignity of the father Qian, retreating to the west.\n\nWhen the season enters autumn, then Qian and Dui once again reside in the west, while Xun and Kan return to the south. Each follows its essence, maintaining its constancy. In general, the principle of supporting yang and restraining yin is the fundamental intent of heaven and earth to foster life.\n\nThe *Hetu* takes ten as its master, with yang in surplus and odd numbers lacking. Heaven and earth oppose each other to form its essence, and once the essence is established, its function is enacted. Thus, the *Luoshu* takes nine as its master, with odd numbers in surplus and even numbers lacking. Heaven envelops earth to enact its function. Therefore, it restrains the yin numbers, reducing them to twenty, and supports the yang completed numbers externally, so that seven and nine vary while six and eight remain unchanged.\n\nHeaven and earth embed these numbers within the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, and the sages follow them to unfold their subtleties. The discussions of earlier scholars have been thorough; I shall not repeat them here. I merely set forth my own insights.\n\n(See the extended explanation on \"one water, three wood, five earth.\")\n\nMaster Jiezhai Cai said: \"*Yi* governs images, while *Fan* governs numbers. The *Hetu* has even numbers; evenness implies mutual opposition. Thus, *Yi* is based on the two qi. The *Luoshu* has odd numbers; oddness implies flowing transformation. Thus, *Fan* is based on the Five Phases.\n\nEvenness is quiescent, and quiescence employs movement as its function; thus, the lines of the *Hetu* unite in odd numbers: one unites with six, two with seven, three with eight, four with nine, five with ten. Oddness is dynamic, and dynamism employs quiescence as its function; thus, the positions of the *Luoshu* unite in even numbers: one unites with nine, two with eight, three with seven, four with six.\n\nTherefore, in the *Yi*, good and ill fortune arise from movement, and the *Hetu* is the movement that originates from within oneself. Thus, one may perceive the subtle and anticipate good fortune; hence, it is called 'Earlier Heaven.' In the *Fan*, good and ill fortune are seen in quiescence. Quiescence is only completed through movement, so the *Luoshu* is the movement that follows heaven. One can only clarify good and ill fortune; hence, it is called 'Later Heaven.'\n\nQi has two aspects, while the phases have five. One, three, five, seven, and nine are the movements of yang. Thus, when the Master summed the five numbers of heaven, he obtained twenty-five. Two, four, six, eight, and ten are the movements of yin. Thus, when he summed the five numbers of earth, he obtained thirty.\n\nTwo cannot transform without five, and the five talents cannot act on their own without two. This speaks of how yin and yang accomplish transformation. That which enacts the spirits and gods lies in the five. The five are the Five Phases.\n\nThe fixed essence of heaven and earth’s yin-yang opposition, from one to ten, is the sequence of yin-yang’s flowing transformation. Divided into odd and even, one, three, five, seven, and nine are yang, while two, four, six, eight, and ten are yin. Arranged in order of priority, one, two, three, four, and five—the generative numbers—are yang, while six, seven, eight, nine, and ten—the completed numbers—are yin.\"\n\nNumbers flow within yin and yang before form is settled; images manifest within yin and yang once form is complete. The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, which embodies the principles of yin and yang yet remains formless. Image corresponds to yin’s stillness, while number corresponds to yang’s movement. The Supreme Ultimate is neither still nor moving, yet it governs stillness. Before the Supreme Ultimate, images and numbers cannot be distinguished by priority. Only when movement arises and yang numbers begin does the image also commence. When stillness arises and the yin image takes shape, the numbers are then completed. Yin and yang diverge and unite; movement and stillness differ. Speaking in terms of establishment: stillness is the time of dual opposition, while movement is the time of singular flow. Speaking in terms of progression: stillness is when yin and yang unite in virtue, while movement is when the two—yang leading, yin following—advance. This passage is subtly profound; readers ought to reflect deeply upon it.\n\nFu Xi based his work on the *Hetu*, first drawing the Primordial Horizontal Diagram. In the horizontal diagram, the sequence from one to eight proceeds in order, while the arrangement of trigrams runs from right to left. The numbers and the circular diagram differ—one moving in reverse, the other in sequence. Greater yang, residing in the first position, divides into Qian and Dui; lesser yin, in the second position, divides into Li and Zhen; lesser yang, in the third position, divides into Xun and Kan; greater yin, in the fourth position, divides into Gen and Kun. This proceeds from top to bottom. Then, from bottom to top and left to right: Gen and Kun emerge from greater yin’s one and six; Xun and Kan emerge from lesser yang’s two and seven; Li and Zhen emerge from lesser yin’s three and eight; Qian and Dui emerge from greater yang’s four and nine. Above the greater yang’s one, generating one odd and one even yields Qian and Dui. Above the lesser yin’s two, generating one odd and one even yields Li and Zhen. Above the lesser yang’s three, generating one odd and one even yields Xun and Kan. Above the greater yin’s four, generating one odd and one even yields Gen and Kun. This is the Primordial Horizontal Diagram. From one to eight, it serves merely as the sequence for generating trigrams.\n\nFu Xi also based his work on the *Hetu* to create the Primordial Circular Diagram. Master Zhu said: In the sixty-four-trigram horizontal diagram, Zhen, Xun, Fu, and Gou occupy the center. Folding the center to form a circular diagram, one begins from Zhen and Fu, moving backward to Qian, then proceeds from Xun and Gou forward to Kun, thus completing the circle. The sequence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as the phases of the moon—new moon, full moon, first quarter, and last quarter—and the alternation of day and night, dawn and dusk, all follow in order. This is the essential principle of diagram construction. He further stated: The horizontal diagram follows a forward sequence, while the square and circular diagrams consistently reverse direction, though the circular diagram reverses only halfway. For details, see the left and right chapters.\n\nThe Primordial Eight Trigrams align with the numbers of the *Luoshu*. The Primordial Eight Trigrams correspond to the *Luoshu*: greater yang’s nine is Qian in the due south, four is Dui in the southeast; lesser yin’s three is Li in the due east, eight is Zhen in the northeast; lesser yang’s two is Xun in the southwest, seven is Kan in the due west; greater yin’s one is Kun in the due north, six is Gen in the northwest. In the circular arrangement, Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen—four yang trigrams—occupy the left, while Xun, Kan, Gen, and Kun—four yin trigrams—occupy the right. The *Book of Documents* also places Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li at the four cardinal directions, with Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen at the four corners. The diagram and the *Book* align in their trigram positions. The difference lies in the interchange of greater yang and lesser yang in the southwest, creating variation.\n\nThe Later Heaven Eight Trigrams align with the numbers of the *Hetu*. The Later Heaven Eight Trigrams also correspond to the *Hetu*’s numbers: one and six, water and Kan, reside in the north; two and seven, fire and Li, reside in the south; three and eight, wood and Zhen, occupy the due east, while Xun occupies the southeast; four and nine, metal and Dui, occupy the due west, while Qian occupies the northwest. Five and ten—Gen at five in the northeast and Kun at ten in the southwest—permeate the central palace as earth. The Later Heaven numbers invariably align with the *Hetu*. Some, observing that two and seven reside in the south as Li, and four and nine in the northwest as Qian and Dui, mistakenly claim ten belongs to the *Luoshu*. Others, seeing nine placed in the south as Qian and two and seven in the southwest as Xun and Kan, erroneously assert nine belongs to the *Hetu*. They claim King Wen modeled this to create the Later Heaven *Yijing*, thus conflating the two diagrams and propagating Liu Mu’s theories. Scholars must be discerning.\n\nIn the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, yin and yang, odd and even, interweave. The *Hetu* combines one, two, three, and four with seven, eight, nine, and six to form ten. The *Luoshu* opposes one, two, three, and four to seven, eight, nine, and six to form ten. Ten is the product of two and five. The numbers of the two are each multiplied by five to generate and complete five. Greater yang’s position is one in the north, yet it contains nine, and its completed number lies in the west. Lesser yin’s position is two in the south, yet it contains eight, and its completed number lies in the east. Lesser yang’s position is three in the east, yet it contains seven, and its completed number lies in the south. Greater yin’s position is four in the west, yet it contains six, and its completed number lies in the north. Thus, they mutually generate and complete one another. In the *Luoshu*, however, they simply oppose each other: one opposes nine in the north and south, three opposes seven in the east and west. The four cardinal directions are thus positioned, while the four corners each form their own oppositions: the northeast corner opposes the southwest corner with two and eight, and the southeast corner opposes the northwest corner with four and six. They also interweave like warp and weft. Both the *Luoshu* and *Hetu* each conceal ten within, doubling the Five Phases to achieve completion. Master Dong’s explanation, focusing solely on the positions of the Four Images and their numbers, is also apt.\n\nZhu Xi said: *The Book of Changes* was first derived by Fuxi from the *Hetu*, with no reliance on the *Luoshu*. The *Hongfan* chapter, however, was uniquely received by Yu from the *Luoshu*, without necessarily tracing back to the *Hetu*. Zheng Xuan said: The sages drew the Eight Trigrams based on the *Hetu* and arranged the Nine Categories based on the *Luoshu*. How could this be likened to drafting a circle with a compass or squaring with a carpenter’s square? There is principle in one, and there is fact in the other. When Fuxi drew the trigrams according to the *Hetu*, he did not foresee the *Luoshu*, yet their numbers coincidentally aligned. When Yu arranged the Nine Categories according to the *Luoshu*, he did not retroactively seek the numbers of the *Hetu* to match them. In my humble opinion, the positions of the *Hetu* correspond to the Primordial Heaven, while those of the *Luoshu* correspond to the Manifested Heaven. Though their positions differ in sequence, and their numbers vary between ten and nine, both are fundamentally rooted in the Five Phases, with five residing at the center—this alone is their unity.\n\nThe transmission of Master Chen Xiyi of Pu Shang: Master Xiyi, whose given name was Chuan, taught numerology to Mu Xiubozhang. Xiubozhang taught Li Zhicai, and Zhicai taught Shao Kangjie, who then composed the *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Xiubozhang also transmitted the *Taiji Diagram* to Zhou Dunyi. Zhu Hanshang said: Dunyi taught the Cheng brothers. At that time, Zhang Zai lectured among the Cheng brothers and Shao Yong. Thus, Dunyi wrote the *Comprehensive Treatise*, Cheng Yi composed the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, and Zhang Zai authored the *Great Harmony* in three sections. He also taught Xiang Zong on symbolic studies, and Zong taught Xu Jian of Lujiang—this branch was transmitted in the south.\n\nSome say the two diagrams of the Primordial Heaven (square and circular) originated from Ma Shi’s enlightenment. Zhu Xi clarified this was not so, stating that the diagrams were all created by Fuxi, containing only trigrams without words or text. After the passing of Confucius and Mencius, they were concealed by esoteric practitioners, only to be transmitted by Xiyi.\n\nCai Xishan said: The images of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were described as such by Han scholars Kong Anguo and Liu Xiang, Wei scholar Guan Lang Ziming, and Song masters Shao Kangjie and Shao Yaofu. It was Liu Mu who first reversed their names, and later scholars followed suit. Thus, they are now restored to their original designations. Ancient records, from Kong Anguo, Liu Xiang and his son Liu Xin, to Ban Gu, all state that the *Hetu* was bestowed upon Fuxi and the *Luoshu* upon Yu. Guan Ziming and Shao Kangjie both identified ten as the *Hetu* and nine as the *Luoshu*. The numbers of the Nine Palaces—nine atop, one below, three on the left, seven on the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet—precisely mirror the pattern of a turtle’s shell.\n\nZhu Xi said: Reading the *Book of Rites* by Dai the Elder yields one clear piece of evidence. Its *Mingtang* chapter contains the phrase “two, nine, four, seven, five, three, six, eight, one.” Zheng’s commentary states: “This follows the pattern of a turtle’s markings.” Thus, the Han scholars indeed took nine as the *Luoshu*. Why then did Liu Mu, with his peculiar views, reverse this, taking nine as the *Hetu* and ten as the *Luoshu*, completely overturning the teachings of earlier scholars? He falsely claimed his diagrams originated from Xiyi, lacking any written record, and that Xu Jian transmitted them to Kuang Chang, who then passed them to Liu Mu. Many adopted his theory, spreading it widely. Later, Zhu Hanshang composed his *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, and Zhang Xingcheng of Shu wrote the *Seven Eases*. Others, like Zheng of Puyang, all followed Liu’s interpretation, none of which had been corrected before. Only with the emergence of Master Zhu and Cai Yijun of Xishan were these errors rectified, restoring ten as the *Hetu* and nine as the *Luoshu*. The world came to trust this. Yet Liu Mu’s theory should not be entirely dismissed.\n\nHere, I cite a few points: He quoted the *Great Commentary*, asserting that both originated in Fuxi’s time, not that they were bestowed upon him. Had later generations not seen the text of the thirteen hexagrams in the *Appended Judgments*, they might have attributed the sixty-four hexagrams solely to King Wen. Had they not seen the text of the *Hongfan*’s heavenly bestowal, they might have assumed the Nine Categories were arranged by Jizi. How would they know that the selection of *Yu* and *Guai* was already present before King Wen composed the hexagrams, or that the offices of Minister of Education and Minister of Works were established on the day Yu received the Nine Palaces? Thus, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* both existed in high antiquity; Fuxi merely drew them, and Yu modeled and arranged them accordingly. In my view, this argument is not without merit. However, to claim the *Luoshu* did not emerge during Yu’s flood control contradicts the statement that “Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Hongfan* Nine Categories.”\n\nRecently, in the Xinwei imperial examination, Liu Mengjian employed this theory. Though he ranked first in the southern palace, many who followed Master Zhu’s interpretation of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were placed behind him. He further argued that the *Yu Gong* speaks of the *Luo* as a path but does not mention obtaining the *Luoshu*, and the *Canon of Shun* refers to “favoring categories” without specifying the Nine Categories. The phrase “Heaven bestowed upon Yu” merely means Heaven inspired him. Liu Mu also said: The fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth are forty-five in the *Hetu*, leaving ten unused. This is because the four corners and four cardinal directions each combine to form ten. Adding the central five, both vertically and horizontally, sums to fifteen, totaling fifty-five. The five is unused because: Heaven’s one plus five makes six, Earth’s two plus five makes seven, Heaven’s three plus five makes eight, Earth’s four plus five makes nine, and Heaven’s five plus five makes ten. Thus it is said: “Earth completes the ten.”\n\nMoreover, the numbers of the Eight Trigrams total thirty-six. The nine unused numbers arise because *Qian* and *Kun* each bear the number nine, *Zhen* and *Xun* each bear the number nine, and *Kan*, *Li*, *Gen*, and *Dui* all bear the number nine. Why then doubt that the nine numbers cannot form the *Hetu*, or that the ten numbers cannot form the *Luoshu*? The four cardinal directions are all odd and yang, while the four corners are all even and yin. As the saying goes: “Solitary yin does not generate, solitary yang does not complete,” and only when one odd and one even are paired does creation arise.\n\nIt is further said: The number one, as a numerical value, is one in Heaven and *jia* in the celestial stems. As an image, it is the central number of six; as a trigram, it is the central line of *Kan*. In doubled trigrams, it is the *initial nine*; in *Fu*, it is the yang line; in the earthly branches, it is *jianzi*; among the Five Phases, it is Water; in the twelve pitch-pipes, it is *Huangzhong*. One is the fixed position. Subtract one from fifty, and one resides within forty-nine. Subtract one again from forty-nine, and one resides within forty-eight. Wherever there are numbers, one is never absent. Wherever one is present, it is invariably the ancestor of the myriad things. To grasp this without fail is to hold the mechanism of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis reasoning is rather sound. I have recorded these discussions at the conclusion of the section on images and numbers to show that such theories flourished alongside the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* in their time, differing only in their inversion and misplacement. Scholars ought not remain ignorant of this.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Thirteen, concludes here.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Fourteen\nBy Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated and Corrected by Fang Wanli of Xugu\n\nThe discourse on \"prior and posterior\" (先天后天) was refined through the contributions of the Four Sages and Four Worthies before its theory reached completion. The Four Sages are: Fu Xi, who drew the trigrams in the *prior Heaven* arrangement; King Wen, who expanded the *Yijing*, and the Duke of Zhou, who composed the line statements—both in the *posterior Heaven* arrangement; and Confucius, whose Ten Wings encompass both *prior* and *posterior Heaven*. The Four Worthies are: Han Yu of the Han, Cheng Shuzhi, Shaozi (Shao Yong), who alone expounded the learning of *prior Heaven*, and Master Zhu (Zhu Xi), who synthesized them into one. Thus, the Dao of the *Yijing* was greatly illuminated for the world. Without the successive efforts of the Four Sages and Four Worthies, the world would still grope in darkness.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Kangjie (Shao Yong) had a poem:\n*\"If one speaks of the prior Heaven, there is nothing at all;\nThe posterior Heaven is where effort must be applied.\"*\nHe also said:\n*\"The Will of Heaven is nothing but spontaneity;\nBeyond spontaneity, there is no Heaven.\"*\nThis conveys the same meaning.\n\nMaster Pan said: *\"The prior Heaven is nothing at all\"*—I arrived at this understanding through the investigation of things. In my youth, I observed chicks hatching from their eggs. At first, they did not peck. Only when their *qi* and allotted time were sufficient did they burst forth, breaking the shell. If one were to assist them even slightly, the chick would emerge weak and fail to thrive. From this, I saw that there is not the slightest room for human interference.\n\nI say: One, two, three, four, five are the generating numbers of Heaven and Earth—this is *prior Heaven*. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten are the completing numbers of Heaven and Earth—this is *posterior Heaven*. Some ask: Is *wuji* becoming *taiji* the *prior Heaven*? Is *taiji* becoming yin and yang the *posterior Heaven*? By analogy, the unmanifest center is *prior Heaven*, while its manifestation in harmony is *posterior Heaven*. The opening of things is *prior Heaven*; their completion is *posterior Heaven*. Uprightness and origin are *prior Heaven*; smoothness and benefit are *posterior Heaven*. Yet even within uprightness, there is a *prior* and *posterior*: the first half of *zi* (子) pertains to yin and is *prior Heaven*, while the latter half pertains to yang and is *posterior Heaven*. *Prior* and *posterior Heaven* apply to all affairs and all things. In silent observation, one grasps more than half the truth—how could this be limited to the arrangement of trigrams alone?\n\nMaster Cai said: Cold and heat, day and night, the yin and yang of living things—all undergo contraction and expansion, growth and decline. This is *prior Heaven*. That by which yang is yang is its ceaseless movement without fixed form. The *qi* and form, the hun and po of living things—here, yang can transform while yin cannot. This is *posterior Heaven*. That by which yin is yin is its stillness with fixed form. Fu Xi’s trigrams are *prior Heaven*—the *qi* of Heaven. King Wen’s trigrams are *posterior Heaven*—the things of Earth. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"To precede Heaven and not violate it is the movement of unified will and *qi*. To follow Heaven and accord with its seasons is the movement of unified *qi* and will.\"* Master Hengqu (Zhang Zai) said: *Qi* and will, Heaven and humanity—there is mutual overcoming in their alternation. In the *Yijing*, every word and meaning flows from this.\n\nSomeone asked: How do the *Taiji* and *Prior Heaven* diagrams compare? Master Zhu said: In terms of their structure, the *Taiji* diagram is not as vast as the *Prior Heaven* diagram. Yet in detailed discussion of their principles, the *Prior Heaven* diagram is not as refined and concise as the *Taiji* diagram. Nevertheless, the *Taiji* ultimately lies within the scope of the *Prior Heaven*. What Shaozi called the learning of *prior Heaven* begins from the moment before a single line is drawn and extends to the completion of the six lines. For example, in Confucius’ Ten Wings, passages such as *\"The eight trigrams are arrayed\"* and *\"The Supreme Polarity generates the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams\"*—Heaven and Earth, thunder and wind, mountain and marsh, water and fire—all derive from Fu Xi’s original trigrams. Before the *prior Heaven* trigrams were drawn, no principle was yet divided. First, one yang and one yin line generate two single lines. Above the Two Modes, each generates one yang and one yin, producing four two-line images. Above the Four Images, each generates one yang and one yin, producing eight three-line trigrams. All arise naturally, without contrivance, and become clear without the need for words or discourse. This is the guiding principle of *Yijing* studies, the first essential truth at the opening of the text. From ancient times until now, none have recognized it—until Kangjie (Shao Yong) transmitted its teaching. This is the *Yijing* of *prior Heaven*.\n\nIt is also said: Fu Xi’s four diagrams, as expounded by the Shao lineage, were created when he first drew the trigrams. First, he made the horizontal diagram of the eight trigrams, then the horizontal diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams. Next, he made the circular diagram of the eight trigrams’ positions, followed by the circular diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams’ positions.\n\nIt is further said: In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, the outer circle represents Heaven, and the inner square represents Earth. Master Cai Xishan said: In the circular arrangement of the sixty-four hexagrams, *Qian* culminates at noon, *Kun* at midnight, *Li* at dawn, and *Kan* at dusk. Yang is born at midnight and reaches its peak at noon; yin is born at noon and reaches its peak at midnight. Yang resides in the south, yin in the north. In the square arrangement, *Qian* begins in the northwest, and *Kun* ends in the southeast. Here, yang is in the north, yin in the south. These two arrangements represent the numerical correspondence of yin and yang. The outer circle is yang, the inner square is yin. The circle moves and is Heaven; the square is still and is Earth. In the circular diagram, *Qian* is in the south and *Kun* in the north. In the square diagram, *Kun* is in the south and *Qian* in the north. The position of *Qian* has more yang lines; the position of *Kun* has more yin lines. Yin and yang each gather according to their kind. The diagram encloses the square within the circle, illustrating that Heaven envelops Earth externally while Earth resides within Heaven. Master Zhu said: The square and circle are especially wondrous.\n\nShaozi had a poem:\n*\"Heaven and Earth take their positions, *Pi* and *Tai* reverse their categories.\nMountain and marsh exchange *qi*, *Xian* and *Sun* reveal their meaning.\nThunder and wind press upon each other, *Heng* and *Yi* arise in intent.\nWater and fire shoot forth, *Jiji* and *Weiji* are achieved.\nThe Four Images intersect, completing sixteen affairs.\"*\n\nThe eight trigrams interact to form sixty-four. Master Zhu explained: \"This elucidates the two intersecting legs of the square and circle diagrams. In the northwest corner stands *Qian*; in the northeast corner, *Kun*—this is Heaven and Earth taking their positions. Opposite them lie *Tai* in the northeast and *Pi* in the southwest. Next to *Qian* is *Dui*; next to *Kun* is *Gen*—this is mountain and marsh exchanging *qi*. Opposite them are *Xian* from *Pi* and *Sun* from *Tai*. The remaining four trigrams follow likewise. Next to *Dui* is *Li*; next to *Gen* is *Kan*—this is water and fire shooting forth. Opposite them are *Jiji* from *Sun* and *Weiji* from *Xian*. Next to *Li* is *Zhen*; next to *Kan* is *Xun*, positioned at the central intersection of the two legs—this is thunder and wind pressing upon each other. Opposite them are *Yi* from *Jiji* and *Heng* from *Weiji*. The Four Images intersect to complete sixteen affairs, precisely because *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Pi* and *Tai*, *Gen* and *Dui* into *Sun* and *Xian*, *Zhen* and *Xun* into *Sun* and *Yi*, and *Kan* and *Li* into *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Each set of four trigrams stands in mutual opposition, exhausting the square of Earth.\"\n\nHe further stated: \"In the *Prior Heaven* circular diagram, four sets of sixteen hexagrams reside externally. In the square diagram, four sets of sixteen hexagrams reside internally. The first sixteen are born of *Qian* and *Kun*; the next sixteen, of *Gen* and *Dui*; the following sixteen, of *Kan* and *Li*; and the last sixteen, of *Zhen* and *Xun*. These four sets of sixteen pairs together complete the square and circular diagrams. The circular diagram represents the yin and yang of the Dao of Heaven. In Heaven, they manifest as the sun, moon, stars, heat, cold, day, and night—termed the *Yi* of ceaseless flow, for it moves with Heaven and Earth through the four seasons without pause. The thirty-two yang hexagrams on the left govern spring’s generation and summer’s growth; the thirty-two yin hexagrams on the right govern autumn’s gathering and winter’s storage. Together, they quadruple the sixteen to form sixty-four hexagrams. Divided by spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each season further quadruples the sixty-four to yield 1,536 hexagram lines of *qi*, circulating through Heaven. The Four Images establish form, the six *jia* cycles revolve, revealing the governance of emperors, kings, and lords near and far. The 366-day rotation is presided over by *Qian* and *Kun*, belonging to Heaven’s creative transformations.\"\n\n\"The square diagram represents the yielding and firmness of the Dao of Earth. On Earth, they manifest as water, fire, soil, stone, rain, wind, dew, and thunder—termed the *Yi* of mutual opposition, for it follows Heaven’s seasons to generate and transform. The inner section of thirty-two yang hexagrams spans from *Qian* in the northwest to *Tai* in the northeast; the outer section of thirty-two yin hexagrams spans from *Pi* in the southwest to *Kun* in the southeast. These also quadruple the sixteen to form sixty-four hexagrams. Divided by *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*, each further quadruples the sixty-four to yield 256 positions of hexagram bodies, giving rise to beings on Earth. The Four Images establish form, the four nines serve as function, revealing the yang chant and yin response of pitch pipes and sounds, the birth and death of creatures moving and still. *Kan* and *Li* preside, belonging to Earth’s creative transformations.\"\n\nThus, Quezi said: \"Sixteen is the number derived from the Four Images’ mutual dependence. All transformations of Heaven and Earth, all resonances of the myriad things, all continuities and changes, gains and losses of past and present—none lie beyond sixteen. With sixteen, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete. Herein lies the opening and closing, waxing and waning, fortune and misfortune, good and evil, each paired in perfect opposition without discrepancy.\"\n\nIn the *Posterior Heaven* *Upper Canon*, eighteen hexagrams reverse their opposites, twelve of which are mutable, while six remain immutable: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Yi*, and *Daguo*. In the *Lower Canon*, eighteen hexagrams reverse their opposites, sixteen of which are mutable, while two remain immutable: *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo*. The *Yi Wei* states: \"The sixty-four hexagrams of the *Yi* are divided by King Wen into the *Upper* and *Lower Canons*.\" Examining the *Sequence of Hexagrams*, all follow the *Posterior Heaven* order, with reversed opposing hexagrams. Of the eight trigrams, four remain immutable: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Two reverse: *Zhen* and *Dui*. *Zhen* reverses to *Gen*, *Dui* reverses to *Xun*. Thus, six trigrams transform into eight, and through doubling, the additional hexagrams *Yi*, *Zhongfu*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo* emerge. Four hexagrams remain unchanged: *Tai* above, and *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the eight trigrams. Twenty-eight hexagrams undergo reversal and mutation. Eight paired with eight yield thirty-six transformations, completing the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\n*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* remain fundamentally immutable, while *Gen* and *Zhen* combine to form *Yi*; *Zhen* and *Gen* combine to form *Xiaoguo*; *Xun* and *Dui* combine to form *Zhongfu*; *Dui* and *Xun* combine to form *Daguo*—all likewise immutable. Though the eight trigrams remain immutable, when *Qian* fully transforms, it becomes *Kun*; when *Kun* fully transforms, it becomes *Qian*. When *Kan* fully transforms, it becomes *Li*; when *Li* fully transforms, it becomes *Kan*. The full transformations of *Yi* and *Daguo*, *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* follow the same pattern.\"\n\nMaster Li said: \"The *Upper* and *Lower Canons* each pair opposites. The *Sequence of Hexagrams* shifts its literary meaning at *Kan* and *Li*, establishing the *Canons* with *Qian* and *Kun* as the two elders standing in opposition, each concealing their names in the sequence. The *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian*, the two youths united in form, yet the sequence uniquely conceals the name *Xian*. *Xu* and *Song* in the *Upper Canon* oppose *Jin* and *Mingyi* in the *Lower Canon*. When *Xu* and *Song* fully transform, they become *Jin*; when *Jin* fully transforms, it becomes *Xu*. *Tai* and *Pi* in the *Upper Canon* oppose *Sun* and *Yi* in the *Lower Canon*. *Tai* and *Pi* arise from the exchange of *Qian* and *Kun*; *Sun* and *Yi* do not exchange. *Xian* and *Heng* exchange, yet do not exchange. In the *Upper Canon*, from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Lin* and *Guan*; in the *Lower Canon*, from *Dun* and *Zhuang* to *Ge* and *Ding*. When *Zhun* and *Meng* fully transform, they become *Ding* and *Ge*; when *Lin* and *Guan* fully transform, they become *Dun* and *Zhuang*. *Yi* and *Daguo* in the *Upper Canon* appear paired before *Kan* and *Li*; *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* in the *Lower Canon* appear paired before *Jiji* and *Weiji*. The *Upper Canon* concludes with *Kan* and *Li*; the *Lower Canon* concludes with *Jiji* and *Weiji*.\"\n\n*Jiji* and *Weiji* are the intermingling of *Kan* and *Li*. Yet they do not intermingle. *Yi* resembles *Li*, and *Daguo* resembles *Kan*, yet *Kan* and *Li* follow these two hexagrams. *Zhongfu* has thick lines, and *Xiaoguo* has thick lines like *Li*. *Kan* and *Jiji/Weiji* again follow these two hexagrams, for *Kan* and *Li* serve as the function of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Dui*.\n\nThe *Upper Canon* contains fifty-two yang lines and fifty-six yin lines. The *Lower Canon* contains fifty-six yang lines and fifty-two yin lines. The division of the *Canon* into upper and lower sections follows a profound principle. It is regrettable that the master’s teachings were not transmitted, and the meaning behind King Wen’s division of the *Canon* has become obscure.\n\nMaster Shao said: *Qian* and *Kun* run vertically while the Six Children run horizontally—this is the root of the *Yi*. He also said: *Zhen* and *Dui* run horizontally while the six hexagrams run vertically—this is the function of the *Yi*.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven* arrangement of the eight hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* are the root of the *Yi*, with the Six Children assisting them. Thus, the Six Children are all horizontal, while *Qian* and *Kun* alone are vertical. The vertical is like the warp in weaving, and the horizontal like the weft. Dividing yin and yang, they interlace to form the weft. *Qian* and *Kun* occupy the south and north to establish the positions of heaven above and earth below. *Qian* has twenty-six yang lines and twelve yin lines; *Kun* has thirty-six yin lines and twelve yang lines. Thus, they plant the warp of heaven and earth, dividing south and north. Then *Li* in the east and *Kan* in the west serve as the sun and moon to form the weft. *Gen* in the northwest opposes *Dui* in the southeast, and *Zhen* in the northeast opposes *Xun* in the southwest—these further serve as the transformations of mountains and marshes, thunder and wind to form the weft.\n\nMoreover, *Xun*, *Li*, *Dui* are yin hexagrams, yet their root in *Qian*’s body paradoxically yields more yang. Thus, their abundance of yang is taken as *Qian*’s weft on the left. *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Kan* are yang hexagrams, yet their root in *Kun*’s body paradoxically yields more yin. Thus, their abundance of yin is taken as *Kun*’s weft on the right. Above and below correspond, one vertical and one horizontal. Yang is odd, yin is even—they stand in mutual opposition. This establishes the structure of the *Yi*, while the *Later Heaven* arrangement serves its function.\n\nIn the *Later Heaven* arrangement of the eight hexagrams, *Zhen* and *Dui* serve as the function of the *Yi*, with the six hexagrams assisting them. Thus, the six hexagrams are all vertical, while *Zhen* and *Dui* alone are horizontal. The horizontal is like the beam of a scale, and the six hexagrams are the stars on the beam. Some are light, some are heavy—they advance and retreat to weigh them. *Zhen* and *Dui* occupy east and west to hold the power of spring’s generation and autumn’s harvest. *Zhen*, with its single yang, generates the six yang of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. Accumulating, they become *Qian*, which resides in the northwest to complete the honor of the father’s way. *Zhen* also contains two yin, which enfold the three yin of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. Combining the six yin, they become *Kun*, which resides in the southeast to complete the goodness of the mother’s way. The east generates, the west completes—one horizontal, six vertical. The horizontal is weighted, with *Zhen* as wood and *Dui* as metal, each in its proper place. *Kan* as water and *Li* as fire intermingle to fulfill their function. This is how the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams serve as the *Yi* of the earth’s surface, responding to human use.\n\nSomeone asked: In the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams, *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Kan*, and *Li* occupy the cardinal positions of east, west, south, and north, and their oppositions are taken for their intermingling. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* occupy the intermediate positions of east, west, south, and north, and their lack of opposition means they do not intermingle. If intermingling serves a function, then non-intermingling serves no function. Yet when I examine this through the numbers of yin and yang, all seem to serve a function—why is this?\n\nThe answer: With the four cardinal hexagrams serving their function, the four corner hexagrams do not serve theirs—yet all hexagrams enter into what serves a function.\n\nMaster Zhang said: The *Former Heaven* eight hexagrams correspond to heaven’s four seasons; the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams correspond to earth’s eight directions. Where do they not serve a function?\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Former Heaven* *Yi* is its structure; the *Later Heaven* *Yi* is its function. The *Former Heaven* employs *Kan* and *Li* as the sun and moon for the transformations of firmness and softness, day and night. The *Later Heaven* employs *Qian* and *Kun*’s nine and six for the transformations of yin and yang, cold and heat. The *Former Heaven* *Yi*’s structure responds to heaven’s qi; the *Later Heaven* *Yi*’s function responds to earth’s directions. The *Former Heaven* hexagram positions are eightfold and cardinal: *Qian* in the south, *Kun* in the north, *Li* in the east, *Kan* in the west, along with *Yi*, *Zhongfu*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo*. The *Later Heaven* hexagram qi are fourfold and cardinal: *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Dui*; the four corners are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, *Qian* and *Kun* divide heaven and earth to establish the positions of above and below. In the *Later Heaven*, *Qian* and *Kun* become the great father and mother, retiring to the northwest and southwest corners. In the *Former Heaven*, *Kan* and *Li* are the sun and moon, arrayed at the gates of *mao* and *you* on the left and right. In the *Later Heaven*, *Kan* and *Li* are water and fire, dividing south and north in the sequence of generation and emergence. The *Former Heaven* eight hexagrams mark the beginning of creation, encompassing heaven above and earth below—*Qian* and *Kun*’s opening and closing, the sun and moon’s rising and setting, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, waxing and waning, dark and new moons, the lengthening and shortening of day and night, the degrees of celestial motion, and the waxing and waning of the seasons—all arise from this. The *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams mark the time after the generation of beings, concerning only the earth’s surface, and thus speak of *Kan* and *Li*. They stand at the solstices, while *Zhen* and *Dui* occupy the fixed positions of the second and eighth months—unlike the waxing and waning of day and night. Thus, the *Appended Judgments* speak of spring, summer, autumn, winter, south, north, east, and west, yet *Kun* speaks only of earth, and *Kan* only of water, never touching upon what lies beneath the earth.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, yin generates yang; in the *Later Heaven*, yang generates yin. In the *Former Heaven*, the four images generate the sun and moon, so yang embraces yin to generate the sun, and yin embraces yang to generate the moon. In the *Later Heaven*, the sun and moon generate the ten thousand things, so when yang moves through yang, the ten thousand things flourish; when yang moves through yin, the ten thousand things contract. In the *Former Heaven*, the sun, moon, and five stars all move left with heaven. In the *Later Heaven*, the sun, moon, and five stars all move right against heaven. The *Former Heaven* employs the four images: water, fire, earth, and stone. The *Later Heaven* employs the five phases: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. In the *Former Heaven*, the thirty-two yang on the left are divided from the hexagram *Guimei*, with *Dui* above and *Zhen* below.\n\nIn the *Later Heaven*, *Zhen* (☳) is east and *Dui* (☱) is west, with *Qian* (☰) extending to *Guimei* (䷵) in twelve steps, counting twenty-one hexagrams from below to above. In the *Former Heaven*, the thirty-two yin on the right are divided from the hexagram *Jian* (䷴), with *Xun* (☴) above and *Gen* (☶) below. In the *Later Heaven*, *Gen* (☶) is above and *Xun* (☴) is below, with *Kun* (☷) extending to *Jian* (䷴) in twelve steps, counting thirty-one hexagrams from below to above.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, one hexagram transforms into seven, with one as the root and seven as its function. In the *Later Heaven*, one hexagram transforms into six, with the hexagram as the root and the lines as its function. In the *Former Heaven*, two and three are the numbers of change, totaling forty-two. In the *Later Heaven*, three and two are the numbers of extension, totaling fifty.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, *Qian* (☰), *Dui* (☱), *Li* (☲), and *Zhen* (☳) are the four yang hexagrams, belonging to Heaven with eight yang and four yin. *Xun* (☴), *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Kun* (☷) are the four yin hexagrams, belonging to Earth with eight yin and four yang. Their numbers are unequal. In the *Later Heaven*, *Qian* (☰), *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Zhen* (☳) are the four yang hexagrams—one father and three sons—with six yin and six yang. *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), *Kun* (☷), and *Dui* (☱) are the four yin hexagrams—one mother and three daughters—with six yin and six yang. Their numbers are equal. *Kun* (☷), *Dui* (☱), *Qian* (☰), and *Kan* (☵) reside in the southwest and north, while *Gen* (☶), *Zhen* (☳), *Xun* (☴), and *Li* (☲) reside in the northeast and southeast, likewise.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the beginning of generation and flourishing starts with the winter solstice as the first of the first. In the *Later Heaven*, the beginning of the generation of things starts with the spring equinox as the first of the second. In the *Former Heaven*, Heaven’s two primary hexagrams are *Qian* (☰) and *Li* (☲), combined with *Yi* (䷚) and *Zhongfu* (䷼), doubling the hexagrams to form Heaven’s four primary hexagrams. *Yi* (䷚) resembles *Li* (☲), and *Zhongfu* (䷼) thickens the line of *Li* (☲). In the *Later Heaven*, Earth’s two primary hexagrams are *Kun* (☷) and *Kan* (☵), combined with *Daguo* (䷛) and *Xiaoguo* (䷽), doubling the hexagrams to form Earth’s four primary hexagrams. *Daguo* (䷛) resembles *Kan* (☵), and *Xiaoguo* (䷽) thickens the line of *Kan* (☵).\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the three palaces of *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱) each contain twenty-eight yang. The three palaces of *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Zhen* (☳) each contain twenty-eight yin. In the *Later Heaven*, *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶) have six yang and twelve yin, while *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱) have six yin and twelve yang. The *Upper Canon*’s *Qian* (☰), *Kun* (☷), *Kan* (☵), and *Li* (☲) are the ancestors of thirty-six hexagrams, while the *Lower Canon*’s *Dui* (☱), *Zhen* (☳), *Xun* (☴), and *Gen* (☶) are the ancestors of twenty-eight hexagrams.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the greater is employed for governance. The three daughters originally embody *Qian* (☰) and follow their father to the southeast. The three sons originally embody *Kun* (☷) and follow their mother to the northwest. In the *Later Heaven*, the lesser is employed for function. The three sons follow their father to the northeast, and the three daughters follow their mother to the southwest.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Later Heaven* is the present *Zhouyi*, as arranged by King Wen. After Confucius composed the *Ten Wings* for King Wen’s *Yi*, his discussions should take the *Zhouyi* as primary. Yet without tracing back to Fu Xi’s original drawing of the hexagrams, scholars will surely mistake King Wen’s arrangement for Fu Xi’s original *Yi*, beginning their explanations from the middle and failing to recognize the root source above. Fu Xi’s *Former Heaven Yi* was expanded by King Wen into the *Zhouyi*, which is the study of the *Later Heaven*. Thus, the canon is divided into upper and lower sections: thirty hexagrams in the upper and thirty-four in the lower. Confucius then composed the *Ten Wings* for it, further dividing them into six parts—*Xiang* (Images), *Xici* (Appended Judgments), each with upper and lower sections—and four additional parts: *Wenyan* (seven), *Shuogua* (eight), *Xugua* (nine), and *Zagua* (ten).\n\nTo \"begin explanations from the middle\" means only to know King Wen’s restoration of the *Yi*. One must further study Fu Xi’s *Former Heaven Yi* to thoroughly grasp the root source above. Master Zhu said: The *Former Heaven* and *Later Heaven* each have their own meanings, but the *Later Heaven* contains more interpretive principles. They do not conflict, and one must not cling to one while abandoning the rest. He also said: In the *Later Heaven*, ten hexagrams discuss hexagram transformation, while nine explain the origins of hexagram formation. Whenever the *Xiang* (Image) commentary does not explain the origin of a hexagram’s formation, it does not mention the changing line.\n\nNow, observing the *Yi Commentaries*, we see that Shao Kangjie’s theories on the *Former Heaven* and *Later Heaven* are most insightful. Combining the explanations of Masters Zhu and Cai, we say: Master Cheng focused solely on *Qian* (☰) and *Kun* (☷) when discussing hexagram transformation, which works for hexagrams with upper and lower bodies that can transform, such as *Gu* (䷑), *Xian* (䷞), *Da* (䷎), and *Jian* (䷴). However, it does not apply to hexagrams that transform as a whole, such as *Song* (䷅), *Yu* (䷆), *Meng* (䷃), and *Shi* (䷆). To say that yang comes from outside is problematic. The *Cheng Commentary* on the hexagram *Ze* (䷔) asks: How could *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Tai* (䷊), and then *Tai* transform into *Ze*? If so, then *Qian* and *Kun* transforming into the six children, and the eight trigrams doubling into sixty-four hexagrams, would all derive from *Qian* and *Kun*. Such an explanation does not hold.\n\nIf *Zhen* (☳) obtains a son through the first line, and the following six hexagrams are already formed, then the meanings derived from these hexagrams belong to the *Later Heaven*. The so-called hexagram transformations also occur after the hexagrams exist. The sages perceived these images and thus expounded them in the *Xiang* (Image) commentary. How could one claim that *Qian* and *Kun* transformed into them? Master Cai of Jiezhai said: Hexagram transformations are all composed of three yang and three yin, inherently possessing the principles of *Qian* and *Kun*, with upper and lower interactions. *Qian*’s firmness intermingles with *Kun* to form *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶), while *Kun*’s softness intermingles with *Qian* to form *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱). When it speaks of \"firmness coming\" or \"firmness descending,\" it clarifies that *Qian* is above and descends to interact with *Kun*. When it speaks of \"softness coming\" or \"softness descending,\" it means *Kun* is above and descends to interact with *Qian*. If it speaks of \"above\" in relation to \"softness ascending,\" then it reverses: *Qian*’s firmness is below and ascends to interact with *Kun*, while *Kun*’s softness is below and ascends to interact with *Qian*. All these derive from the mutual interactions of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nAs for *Song* (䷅) and *Yu* (䷆), which only mention \"firmness coming\" and \"firmness coming from outside,\" these hexagrams have four yang and two yin, not the result of *Qian* and *Kun*’s upper and lower interactions. *Qian*’s body remains above, unmoved, while the firmness of *Kan* (☵) and *Zhen* (☳) comes from outside. All these meanings arise from the hexagrams of the *Later Heaven*. Master Zhu said: Fu Xi’s circular arrangement of the eight trigrams was created through mutual opposition.\n\nFu Xi’s sixty-four hexagrams in the horizontal arrangement were created through the principle of *flowing movement*. What governs *opposition* is secretly employed through *flowing movement*. *Opposition* arises from stillness as its body. Fu Xi’s eight trigrams embody *opposition*. When stillness gives rise, then fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse proceed from oneself. Thus it is said: the *Former Heaven* sequence is formed by the waxing and waning of the two *qi*, which is the principle of creation and the generation of beings.\n\nKing Wen’s eight trigrams in the circular arrangement were created through *flowing movement*. King Wen’s sixty-four hexagrams in the horizontal arrangement were created through *opposition*. What governs *flowing movement* is necessarily employed through *opposition*. *Flowing movement* arises from motion as its body. King Wen’s eight trigrams embody *flowing movement*. When motion is accomplished, then fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are received from Heaven. Thus it is said: the *Later Heaven* sequence is formed by the flourishing and decline of the myriad things, which is the principle of creation’s cyclical movement.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is only *opposition* and *flowing movement*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the purest form of *opposition*. *Kan* and *Li* are the intermingling of *opposition*. *Xian* (䷞) and *Dai* (䷟) are the progression of *opposition*. *Jiji* (䷾) and *Weiji* (䷿) are the mixture of *opposition*. The *yin* and *yang* of *opposition* thus have the same function as the *yin* and *yang* of *flowing movement*. Only *yang* is employed in function: when still, it is two; when in motion, it is one. *Opposition* reverts to motion and becomes *flowing movement*. *Flowing movement* reverts to stillness and becomes *opposition*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Former Heaven Diagram* possesses the marvels of *transformation* and *exchange*. The 192 lines on the left are fundamentally all *yang*. The 192 lines on the right are fundamentally all *yin*. Within *yin* there is *yang*, and within *yang* there is *yin*—this is *yang* advancing to exchange with *yin*, and *yin* coming to exchange with *yang*. The two sides correspond to each other, mutually transforming to form this diagram. In reality, it is not that one moves toward the other; it is merely that their images appear thus.\n\nOn the left side of the diagram, belonging to *yang*: from *Zhen* (one *yang*), to *Li* and *Dui* (two *yang*), to *Qian* (three *yang*). This is *yang* within *yang*, *yang* moving in sequence. On the right side of the diagram, belonging to *yin*: from *Xun* (one *yin*), to *Kan* and *Gen* (two *yin*), to *Kun* (three *yin*). This is *yin* within *yin*, *yin* moving in reverse.\n\n*Kun* has no *yang*; *Gen* and *Kan* have one *yang*. This is *yang* within *yin* moving in reverse. *Qian* has no *yin*; *Li* and *Dui* have one *yin*, *Zhen* has two *yin*. This is *yin* within *yang* moving in reverse. The five lines on the west are the *gou* (intermingling) of the five lines on the east. *Yang* having passed returns to the east, just as the five lines on the west. *Yin* and *yang* mutually transform through exchange, giving rise to the *Yi*’s *transformation*. Though the *Yi*’s *transformations* are manifold, this is the primary *transformation*.\n\nAt first, Fu Xi merely saw *yin* and *yang* beneath the Supreme Ultimate, so he drew one *yin* and one *yang*. One became two. On one *yang*, another *yang* and another *yin* were born; on one *yin*, another *yin* and another *yang* were born. Continuing thus in generation: from two to four, from four to eight, until eight times eight made sixty-four, all unfolding naturally. Such perfect order is the marvel of Heaven and Earth. The *Former Heaven Diagram* was merely sketched by the hand of the sage. In a single day, there is a principle of thought; in a month, a principle of lassitude. Extending to the twelve *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*—129,600 years—it is still only this principle. Vastly encompassing the 129,600 years of ancient and modern times, it is still only this cycle. Minutely observing the birth and death of beings, the movements of a day, an hour, a month, a year—it is still only this cycle. All proceed from *Fu* (䷗) and extend outward; it is merely the principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. What was small transforms into what is large; when it reaches its greatest extent, it transforms again into what is small.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Former Heaven Diagram* is the *ring within*. Master Zhang said: That which is round on the outside is Heaven; that which is square within is Earth. Humans stand upon the Earth and thus are within the *ring*. I say: Observing from above and below, *Qian* in the south is Heaven, *Kun* in the north is Earth. Observing from left and right, from *Zhen* to *Qian* on the left is Heaven. Great *yang*, great *yin*, lesser *yang*, and lesser *yin* arise, and the Dao of Heaven is complete. From *Xun* to *Kun* on the right is Earth. Great firmness, great softness, lesser firmness, and lesser softness arise, and the Dao of Earth is accomplished. Heaven envelops Earth externally. The two *qi* of *yin* and *yang*, though endlessly transforming, follow a single principle, cycling without end. This is why it is called the *ring within*.\n\nDwelling within the *ring* as human relationships: from *Qian* the ruler and *Kun* the minister, the *Family*, father and son, *Xian* and *Dai*, husband and wife, the six children emerge. Applying the *ring* to verify the square city: the Gate of Heaven has no above, the Door of Earth has no below. Rivers and marshes flow into the southeast, their currents endless. Kunlun rises in the northwest, its height unmatched. The great brightness of dawn emerges from *Li*; the *yin* spirit is conceived in the west within *Kan*. Thunder issues from *Zhen*, and the myriad things awaken. Wind enters *Xun*, and the myriad things wither. The images of the *ring within* may be glimpsed here.\n\nSeeking it in the four seasons: at the winter solstice, the *yang* spirit arrives at midnight; at the summer solstice, the *yin* ghost retreats at noon. The three *yang* and three *yin* divide spring; the three *yin* and three *yang* mark autumn’s midpoint. From crescent to full, from waning to new, the moon has its beginning and end. From dawn to day, from dusk to night, the *qi* has its reversal and sequence. Within the *ring*, the years, months, days, and hours—existence and decay, advance and retreat—may be discerned here.\n\nSeeking it in the opening and closing of *yin* and *yang*: Heaven initiates and Earth responds, giving rise to the sounds of the sun, moon, and stars. Earth harmonizes with Heaven, producing the tones of water, fire, earth, and stone. Opening and closing, the trigger moves and the pipes resound—this is the music of the *ring within*, rooted in Heaven’s truth. Seeking it in detail, it is nameless yet may be named.\n\nFu Xi released it to form the square and round diagrams. Emperor Shun performed it to bring forth the nine movements of the *Xiao Shao*.\n\nShào Kāngjié grasped it and composed the *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Can one stand within the *ring*, bearing Heaven and treading Earth, yet remain unaware of its workings?\n\nKāngjié’s self-eulogy speaks of \"playing with the ring at leisure,\" where moments come and go. He also said: \"Since comprehending the meaning of the *ring within*, not a wisp of stray *qi* lingers in my breast.\" Thus, within his breast, he naturally possessed a *ring within*—this much is clear.\n\nHe further declared: \"The learning of *Xiāntiān* is the method of the heart.\" Hence, all diagrams begin from the center, for the myriad transformations and affairs arise from the heart.\n\nMaster Zhū said: \"The white space at the center is the *Tàijí*. The thirty-two *yīn* and thirty-two *yáng* form the Two Modes. The sixteen *yīn* and sixteen *yáng* constitute the Four Images. The eight *yīn* and eight *yáng* make up the Eight Trigrams. The two sides arise as *yīn* rooted in *yáng* and *yáng* rooted in *yīn*. This pairing emerges from the center, yet what issues from the *Tàijí* at the center is without counterpart—this is the method of the heart.\"\n\nIn my humble view: In the *Xiāntiān Diagram*, that which arises from *kūn* begins with *fù*, and that which arises from *qián* begins with *gòu*. Both reside within Heaven and Earth. The center is the heart, the *Tàijí*. It transcends the myriad things yet moves within them—hence, it is without counterpart.\n\nHe also said: \"Though the *Diagram* bears no text, I speak of it all day without ever departing from it. The principles generating Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all contained within.\" The *Xiāntiān Diagram* possesses positions and numbers, yet initially, no words or texts could convey it. Yet what lies within encompasses all—from the vastness of Heaven and Earth to the minutest tip of a hair. Above, the sun, moon, and stars; below, water, fire, earth, and stone. Transforming into heat and cold, day and night; transmuting into rain, wind, dew, and thunder. Resonating as temperament, form, and body; responding as creatures that walk, fly, and grow as plants. In humans, manifesting as ears, eyes, nose, and mouth; in things, as colors, sounds, *qi*, and flavors. Extending into epochs, kalpas, eons, and generations; dispersing into years, months, days, and hours. Affairs have substance and function, dividing into the eras of emperors, kings, and hegemons. Endeavors have their paths, branching into the *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Songs*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Though principle is one, its manifestations are many—nowhere does it not reside within.\n\nMaster Shào’s poem reads:\n*The sun, moon, and stars shine brightly above,\nThe emperors, kings, and hegemons spread grandly below.*\nThis may be called a pavilion within the breast, open on all sides.\n\nMaster Zhū praised him, saying:\n*A hero heaven-endowed, peerless in spirit,\nRiding wind and lashing thunder, his gaze boundless.\nWith hands he probes the moon’s cavern, with feet he treads the sky’s root.\nIn leisure, he spans past and present; in intoxication, he embraces Heaven and Earth.*\nSuch is the manner in which he vividly portrays one of the Dao—his bearing and presence.\n\nHe also said: \"In stillness, he deduced the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.\"\n\nMaster Zhū remarked: \"Kāngjié’s *Nánzǐ Yín* speaks of the *Xiāntiān Diagram*, where numbers take their origin. *Tiāngēn* and *yuèkū* refer to the hexagrams *fù* and *gòu*.\" His poem reads:\n*Ears and eyes keen, the body of a true man,\nEndowed by the great potter—how could he be poor?\nOnly by probing the moon’s cavern can one know things;\nWithout treading the sky’s root, how can one recognize people?\nWhen *qián* meets *gòu*, the moon’s cavern is born;\nWhen Earth encounters thunder, the sky’s root appears.\n*Tiāngēn* and *yuèkū*, idly coming and going,\nThe thirty-six palaces—all are spring.*\n\n\"All are spring\" signifies the flowing of Heavenly principle.\n\nHe further said: \"In the *Diagram*, from *fù* to *qián* is *yáng*; from *gòu* to *kūn* is *yīn*. Since the two—*yīn* and *yáng*—govern good and evil, the beings they endow cannot but bear distinctions of purity and impurity. *Yáng* governs humans, *yīn* governs things. *Gòu* lies above in the *Diagram*, hence the phrase 'hand probes'; *fù* lies below, hence 'foot treads.'\"\n\nCài Xīshān said: \"*Tiāngēn* depicts the state of a good person, *yuèkū* that of a petty person. The thirty-six palaces are the lines of *yīn* and *yáng* in the Eight Trigrams.\" Another said: \"The terms 'human' and 'thing' cannot be simply divided into good and evil. 'All are spring'—even *yuèkū* is spring.\"\n\nMaster Zhū said: \"In terms of correct principle, *yáng* is good and *yīn* is evil—they form a pair, each with its own governance. Kāngjié likely referred to the source of living things: the upright *qi* becomes human, the biased *qi* becomes things—this is the distinction between *yīn* and *yáng*. Jìtōng’s discussion, however, seems to be an extended interpretation. Is 'all are spring' spoken solely in terms of correctness?\"\n\nHe asked: \"Crows, owls, toads, lizards, noxious weeds, and poisonous herbs—can one say they are not the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*? That which is *yīn* and base is called 'thing'; that which is *yáng* and noble is called 'Heaven.'\"\n\nIn my humble view: From *fù* to *qián*, there are one hundred twelve *yáng* and eighty *yīn*; from *gòu* to *kūn*, one hundred twelve *yīn* and eighty *yáng*. *Yīn* and *yáng* intermingle, their interactions and encounters all bearing the essence of spring, flowing within them. Within my own body, too, there are these *fù* and *gòu*. On the summer solstice, when the sun is in *Dōngjǐng*, the myriad things turn toward nothingness. I, however, gather inward, returning to the uncarved, withdrawing blossoms to bear fruit—this is the resurgence of life’s intent within. On the winter solstice, when the sun is in *Qiānniú*, the myriad things turn toward being. I then expand outward, reaching to Heaven and coiling upon Earth—this is the flourishing of life’s intent without. Viewed thus, the creative work of the Maker by day is the flow of life’s intent, while human rest at night is the return of life’s intent. Where is there not spring?\n\nChéng Bózǐ said: \"Kāngjié’s learning is the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship.\" At the outset of Kāngjié’s entry into the Dao, Lord Qīngshè imparted to him the study of the nature of things and the mandate of life. Later, amid movement and stillness, he perceived it and attained its handle.\n\nThus his poems declare:\n*\"The body lies behind Heaven and Earth,\nThe heart stands before Heaven and Earth.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"From the One Center, creation divides,\nFrom the heart, great plans arise.\"*\nThis was his self-attained realization.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Quezi carried this learning within his belly, thus he could encompass the cosmos from beginning to end, past and present.\" And again: \"His marrow was the *Huangji Jingshi* book; his blossoms and grasses were his poetry.\"\n\nI say: Inner sageliness is the prior Heaven—within the *Xiantian Tu*, each stroke and line, from Heaven above to Earth below, from ancient times to the present, all is encompassed. Outer kingship is the posterior Heaven. Thus, in his advancement, he fully unfolded within the realm of emperors, kings, and hegemons. Past and present order and chaos, the flourishing and withering of people—all were seen within stillness, without the slightest deviation. Therefore, inner and outer form a single thread, prior and posterior leave nothing behind.\n\nMaster Lin said: \"The *Xiantian Tu* is the study of nature and life. His books and poems all flowed from this diagram.\" Master Shao’s learning of prior Heaven was not lightly transmitted to unworthy recipients. When Master Zhang was magistrate of Shangluo, he repeatedly visited the master’s dwelling and bowed to him, asking: \"How many days does it take to master this learning?\" The master replied: \"There is nothing much to it—with your talent, it can be grasped in an instant. But you must follow me in the woods for ten years, allowing worldly concerns to scatter, before it can be transmitted.\"\n\nWhen Shu He came to study, he ceaselessly cited ancient and modern examples. The master said: \"Set that aside for now—prior Heaven has no need for so many words. First, empty your heart, making your breast vast and unburdened, free of any affair, before it is possible.\"\n\nThus his poems say:\n*\"If asked about the primordial One character...\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Strength to uproot mountains and cover the world is called talent,\nYet here, not even the slightest force avails.\"*\n\nWhen the master fell slightly ill, Shu tasted his medicinal porridge and said: \"I am no Yellow Stone or foolish old man—kneeling to tie your shoes would suffice to obtain it.\" The master replied: \"Without a sincere heart, the Way is distant.\" Shu was then convinced in his heart. The hearts of these two disciples had already been grasped by the master. For his breast was crystalline, responding to things as they came—yet he did not transmit to those unworthy. As with Qin Zhen and Ren Yan, or Zheng Yang of Jiangnan, who stole his learning to seek glory and wealth, they ultimately starved to death.\n\nI say: The learning of prior Heaven cannot be attained except by one whose nature is purely of Heaven.\n\nThe \"thirty-six palaces\" have been interpreted in four ways by former scholars:\n1. *Qian* as one and *Dui* as two make three; *Li* as three and *Zhen* as four make seven; *Xun* as five and *Kan* as six make eleven; *Gen* as seven and *Kun* as eight make fifteen.\n2. The nine lines of *Qian* and *Kun*; the five lines each of *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* make fifteen; the four lines each of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* make twelve.\n3. *Qian* as one pairs with *Kun* as eight, down to *Zhen* as four pairing with *Xun* as five—eight palaces forming four nines, totaling thirty-six.\n4. The eight proper hexagrams plus twenty-eight inverted hexagrams make thirty-six, matching the hidden hexagrams of prior Heaven.\n\nI say: This last interpretation is correct.\n\nMaster Fang of Xugu criticized them, saying: \"The theory of palaces based on the sequence of prior Heaven hexagrams is inappropriate; dividing odd and even hexagrams into daytime palaces is fabricated; the theory of quadrupling nine is unclear. As for the fourth interpretation—adding proper and inverted hexagrams to obtain thirty-six hidden palaces—it is clever but insipid.\"\n\nIn my view: In the *Xiantian Circular Diagram*, *Fu* begins at *zi*, and the left 180 days form eighteen palaces. *Gou* begins at *wu*, and the right 180 days form eighteen palaces. One *xun* (ten-day period) is one palace, and the 360 days of a year complete the cycle of gestation and return.\n\nI say: This interpretation is good but not exhaustive. Let me complete it:\nFrom *zi* to *si*, the six branches correspond to the six hexagrams from *Fu* to *Qian*. From *wu* to *hai*, the six branches correspond to the six hexagrams from *Gou* to *Kun*. *Qian* begins with *initial nine*, a single yang that does not interact. *Kun* begins with *initial six*, which becomes *Fu*—the hexagram of the eleventh month—named by Quezi as the \"Heavenly Root,\" meaning the odd yang is the root, born at *zi*. *Kun* begins with *initial six*, a single yin that rises to interact. *Qian* begins with *initial nine*, which becomes *Gou*—the hexagram of the fifth month—named the \"Cavern of the Sun and Moon,\" meaning the even yin symbol emerges as a cavern at *wu*.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents, thus giving birth to *Fu* and *Gou*. *Fu* and *Gou* are the lesser parents, generating one yin and one yang. The alternation of yin and yang begins here. *Fu* and *Gou* become *Lin* and *Dun*, marking the ebb and flow of two yins and two yangs—this is the month of *chou* and *wei*. From *Lin* and *Dun* to *Pi* and *Tai*, the ebb and flow of three yins and three yangs—this is the month of *yin* and *shen*. Proceeding to four yins and four yangs, forming *Guan* and *Zhuang*; five yins and five yangs, forming *Cui* and *Bo*. Finally, six yins and six yangs intermingle and transform. *Fu* and *Gou* return to *Qian* and *Kun*, and *Qian* and *Kun* return to *Fu* and *Gou*, flowing and opposing within the twelve palaces. Within these, there can be no yin without yang, no yang without yin. Divided, they become thirty-six yins and thirty-six yangs, scattered within the 360 days. Combined, they are but one yin and one yang. Doubling the five phases yields the thirty-six palaces.\n\nThings obtain this and are born and transformed; people obtain this and are harmonious and joyful—how great is this spring!\n\nExtending this further, thirty-six becomes seventy-two, and the numbers are inexhaustible. Contracting it, one day has 36,000 seconds, and one month has 360 hours.\n\nEven in the finest details—whether a single insect, fish, plant, or tree—each possesses its own yin and yang, weaving as warp and weft within. Yet people remain unaware of this.\n\nThe noble person who studies and attains this understanding delights in Heaven’s decree and knows fate, free from worry.\n\nNow, regarding the left rotation of the Heavenly Dao and the right revolution of the sun and moon, with yang on the left and yin on the right, day and night succeeding one another—there are three explanations for this:\n\nFirst, the unity of the Heavenly Dao and the sun and moon;\nsecond, *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo*;\nthird, *The Precelestial Diagram*.\n\nTheir positions are determined by facing south from the north, with east on the left and west on the right.\n\nYet *The Precelestial Diagram* derives its left and right from *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo*, while *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo* themselves arise from the left rotation of Heaven and the right motion of the sun and moon. Thus it is said: \"The hanging images display their brightness—none greater than the sun and moon.\" Ah! Heaven’s revelation to humanity is most profound.\n\n*The Essential Meaning of Ancient Texts* states: \"The celestial wheel rotates left from west to east, while the sun and moon revolve right from east to west.\" It also says: \"The twenty-eight lunar lodges all follow Heaven’s motion in leftward rotation, while the sun, moon, and five planets all move right along the earthly path. The sun travels through the six *jia* of Heaven, meeting the Dipper. The Dipper’s handle points left according to the monthly establishment, while the sun meets the moon and moves right. In the first month, the Dipper points to *yin* in the east, and the sun and moon converge northward in *hai*, aligning with *yin*. In the fourth month, the Dipper points to *si* in the south, and the sun and moon converge westward in *shen*, aligning with *si*. Heaven moves left by one degree, distributing *qi* to generate beings. The sun and moon also shift right by one degree, altering the seasons to respond to Heaven. When Heaven and the sun align, the *qi* and climate harmonize.\"\n\nMoreover, Jupiter and the Great Year also move left and right. The Great Year corresponds to the sequence from *zi* to *hai*. Jupiter is the essence of wood, called the Year Star; Mars is the essence of fire, called the Sparkling Deluder, and so on. Jupiter, being yang, moves right through the heavens, traversing the twelve celestial stations. The Great Year, being yin, moves left through the earth, passing through the twelve earthly branches. Thus, twelve years complete one cycle, forming a great era. For details, see *Shaoyang*.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Heaven rotates left, the sun moves right.\" He also said: \"Left rotation and right motion—this is the intersection of Heaven and the sun.\" And again: \"Kan and Li stand as the gates of left and right, the places where the sun and moon enter and exit.\"\n\n*The River Chart*’s *Earthly Image* states: \"Heaven moves left, beginning at Oxherd; Earth moves right, beginning at Net.\" The degrees of Heaven and Earth diverge.\n\nIt is also said: \"*The Writ of the Luo*, in terms of the sequence of movement, begins in the west, then proceeds to the south, east, center, and north—rotating right in a full circle before returning to the west. This symbolizes Earth’s rightward motion to generate beings.\"\n\nCai Jiufeng said: \"In form, the number is ten; in function, it is nine. Ten cannot change—this is the number of *The River Chart*. Nine can change—this is *The Writ of the Luo*. *The Chart* arranges its numbers in opposition to establish form; *The Writ* interlaces its numbers to enable function. Once form is established, if the numbers do not change, function cannot proceed.\"\n\nNow, applying the mutable numbers of *The Writ of the Luo*:\nIn one diagram, the numbers for left and right rotation are complete.\nYang moves left with three:\nHeaven is round, its diameter one, circumference three—three is the number of Heaven.\nOne is in the north.\nOne multiplied by three is three, which is in the east.\nThree times three is nine, residing in the south.\nNine times three is twenty-seven, residing in the west.\nThree times twenty-seven is eighty-one, returning to one in the north.\nFrom north to east, east to south, south to west, west back to north—endlessly cycling, perfectly embodying the principle of Heaven’s left rotation.\n\nEarth is square, its diameter one, circumference four—two doubled.\nFor Earth’s numbers begin with two, taking yin as their origin.\nIts position is in the southwest, moving right.\nTwo doubled is four, residing in the southeast.\nTwo times four is eight, in the northeast.\nTwo times eight is sixteen, in the northwest.\nTwo times sixteen is thirty-two, returning to two in the southwest.\nFrom its original position in the southwest to the southeast, southeast to northeast, northeast to northwest, northwest back to southwest—also endlessly cycling, perfectly harmonizing with the theory of Earth’s rightward motion.\n\nOne, three, seven, nine—yang occupies the four cardinal directions.\nTwo, four, six, eight—yin occupies the four corners.\nLeft and right rotation interweave as warp and weft.\nSuch is the marvel of creation.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, no thing lacks left and right—from our own hands, feet, ears, and eyes to men on the left and women on the right, host on the left and guest on the right—all follow this pattern, rooted in the fixed divisions of creation.\n\nIf one examines *The River Chart*, the same principle applies, though yin and yang are arranged in opposition internally and externally, with differences in their interlacing.\n\n*The Original Subtleties of Heaven*, Scroll Fourteen, concludes.\n\n**The Subtleties of Heaven’s Origin, Scroll Fifteen**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai*\n*Collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu*\n\n**The Subtleties of Heaven’s Origin, Scroll Fifteen**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai*\n*Collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu*\n\n---\n\n**Section Two: The Two Middles**\n\nThe numbers one through ten are the complete enumeration of Heaven and Earth. Five and six are the central numbers of Heaven and Earth. Five, residing at the center of Heaven, governs the generating numbers; six, residing at the center of Earth, governs the completing numbers. Five is also called the \"center of yang,\" for it stands amid one, three, seven, and nine. Six is also called the \"center of yin,\" for it stands amid two, four, eight, and ten.\n\nSpeaking of the total numbers of Heaven and Earth: five fives make twenty-five, five sixes make thirty, and five tens with five make fifty-five. Omitting the five leaves the Heavenly numbers. Centered on five, the remainder is fifty, which is the number of the *Great Expansion*. Omitting the six leaves the Earthly numbers. Centered on six, the remainder is forty-nine, which is the number of the *Stalks and Milfoil*. These two central numbers circulate between Heaven and Earth. Those who attain the center are upright and auspicious; those who exceed or fall short are #1 lost and inauspicious.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The origin of Heaven and Earth lies in the center. Man dwells at the center of Heaven and Earth, and the heart dwells at the center of man. When the sun reaches its zenith, it is at its fullest; when the moon reaches its midpoint, it is full. Thus the noble person values the timely center.\"\n\nThe *Great Ultimate* divides into Heaven and Earth. In Heaven and Earth, it becomes man; in man, it becomes the heart. Man is the heart of Heaven and Earth. Within the human heart lies another Heaven and Earth. When the sage emerges to establish the center and create the ultimate, he can give Heaven and Earth a heart, guiding all under Heaven to return to the center. Thus he assists in #3 completing and harmonizing with Heaven.\n\nTherefore, Heaven takes *wu* (noon) as its center, Earth takes *zi* (midnight) as its center. Yang takes *mao* (dawn) #4 as its center, yin takes *you* (dusk) as its center. Heaven and Earth never deviate from the center for even a moment.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"When the sun reaches its zenith, it shifts; when the moon is full, it wanes.\" Excess leads to decline and imbalance—this is why the noble person values the timely center.\n\nThe *Great Commentary on the Changes* speaks of the numbers of Heaven and Earth as fifty-five, and the number of the *Great Expansion* as fifty. The Heavenly numbers are twenty-five, five times five. The Earthly numbers are thirty, six times five. The *Lesser Expansion* is ten, two times five. The *Great Expansion* is fifty, ten times five.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Dong Zhu once said that all numbers do not exceed five. Five is the ancestral number, corresponding to the three yang and two yin of Heaven and Earth, interwoven so that all numbers resolve to five. Three times three and three times two—both the numbers of old yin and old yang—are five. Two times three and one times two—the number of young yin—is five. Two times two and one times three—the number of young yang—is five. From one five to nine five, the blessings total forty-#5five. The numbers of the nine chapters are all five. Thus, both the *Diagram* and the *Book* take five as the ancestral origin of numbers.\n\nTherefore, qi has the five phases, man has the five constants, Heaven has the five stars, Earth has the five peaks, music has the five tones, and colors have the five hues. Extending further: governance has the five teachings, rituals have the five orders, garments have the five insignia, punishments have the five penalties, food has the five flavors and five grains, and armies have the five formations of troops and chariots. All are governed by the Heavenly center of five—this is evident.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Canon of Yao* speaks of a full year as three hundred and sixty-six days. *Kang Gao* states that after five or six days, it reaches a full decade. Hexagrams have six lines, and the moon has five or six periods totaling thirty days. Six days after birth, light appears; six days later, the first quarter; six days later, the full moon. Another six days, the waning begins; another six days, its function ceases. From *zi* to *si* are the six yang months; from *wu* to *hai* are the six yin months. Five and six multiply to generate transformation. Thus, two sixes make twelve months; three sixes make eighteen changes; four sixes make the twenty-four solar terms; six sixes make the number of a full year.\n\nExtending further: man has the six virtues, six conducts, and six arts; vessels have the six ritual goblets, six ceremonial wine vessels, six sacrificial dishes, and six offering stands; music has the six pitch standards and six complementary tones; the *Rites of Zhou* has the six canons and six ministries; the queen has the six robes. Also, food uses the six grains, meals use the six livestock, drink uses the six pure beverages, delicacies use one hundred twenty items, sauces use one hundred twenty jars, and tripods use twelve objects—all are six. By governing six with five and pairing six with five, the myriad transformations never lose the Earthly center of six.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The numbers of Heaven and Earth take six as their measure. When six yang reaches its extreme, one yin is born to restrain it and prevent excess. When six yin reaches its extreme, one yang is born to restrain it and prevent overgrowth. This restraint is called the \"measure of Heaven and Earth,\" and the four seasons are thereby completed. The division of *zi* and *wu* (midnight and noon) marks the great measures of Heaven and Earth. The four seasons and eight nodes complete a year—these are the greatest measures. Six becomes twelve, twenty-four, and seventy-two—these are the lesser measures. Day divides into day and night, numbers divide into odd and even, each forming twelve. The use of two hundred twenty-four is also measured by six.\n\nThe numbers of the *Changes* total sixty: thirty-six for old yang, paired with twenty-four for old yin, together making sixty. Thirty-two for young yin, paired with twenty-eight for young yang, also making sixty. Ten stems and twelve branches combine to make sixty. The five tones and twelve pitches of bells and pipes accumulate to sixty.\n\nMaster Shao said: The heavenly stems end with six, the earthly branches end with five. The *Inner Transmission* records that the Yellow Emperor commanded Da Rao to create the *Jia-Zi* system, divining by the handle of the Dipper’s bowl. He named *jia* and *yi* as days—these are the heavenly stems. He named *zi* and *chou* as months—these are the earthly branches. Stems and branches combine to form the sixty-day cycle.\n\nIn my humble opinion: That which originates in five ends in six; that which originates in six ends in five. Five is the ten heavenly stems, #6 six is the twelve earthly branches. Two sixes pair to make twelve; five and six multiply to make thirty. Yang numbers begin with thirty, hence a month has thirty days, and a generation has thirty years.\n\nYin numbers begin with twelve, hence a day has twelve *chen* (double-hours), and a year has twelve months. Multiplying a year’s months by thirty yields three hundred sixty days; multiplying a year’s days by twelve yields four thousand three hundred twenty *shi* (hours). Twelve and thirty, when added or multiplied, are all derived from five and six.\n\nThe *Qianxu* takes the central number of heaven: five multiplied by five makes twenty-five, the central number of earth; five multiplied by six makes thirty. Combined, fifty-five forms the *xuanxu* (mysterious void), the numbers of generation and completion. The generating numbers are one, two, three, four, five—five stands at heaven’s center and precedes six. The completing numbers are six, seven, eight, nine, ten—six stands at earth’s center and follows five. One and five form six (water); two and five form seven (fire); three and five form eight (wood); four and five form nine (metal); five and five form ten (earth). Water has source and outflow; fire has flame and radiance; wood has root and branch; metal has edge and blade; earth has foundation and burial mound—all do not exceed five and six.\n\nWithin yang, five becomes ten by doubling; within yin, six becomes twelve by doubling. Kangjie (Shao Yong) took these two central numbers to compose the *Huangji Lishi* (Supreme Principles Through the Ages), thereby illuminating the principle of the great mean and perfect correctness. Masters Ma and Shao, morning and evening, expounded and clarified this together, and the learning of the *xuanxu* was thus refined.\n\nHeaven’s movements: in small cycles, they change through five and six; in great cycles, they change through sixty. When correlated with hexagram qi: one month has five hexagrams, one hexagram has six lines—five and six make thirty. Six yang and six yin: the twelve branches course through the twelve months and three hundred sixty days. This is the small cycle advancing and retreating by six days, hence the small cycle changes through six. Sixty changes, with their remaining fractions, also complete three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven’s Dao changes through six, with residual fractions: six days pass through six *chen*. After *zi* (midnight), the six *shi* advance; after *wu* (noon), the six *shi* retreat. Further correlating with the six *jia*: sometimes change occurs every six months, sometimes every six years, sometimes every sixty years, sometimes every three hundred sixty years. Thus, the great cycle changes through sixty, and six changes, with their residual fractions, yield three hundred sixty-six.\n\nIn great cycles, sixty years mark one change—*jiazi* and *jiawu* each constitute one generation. In small cycles, six months mark one change: after *zi*, six months bring growth; after *wu*, six months bring decline. Six years mark one change—the number of the six qi. Sixty years mark one change—the number of the five movements.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan said: Heaven’s numbers center on five; earth’s numbers center on six. Heaven has yin and yang, so doubling five makes ten. Combining three and seven, or one and nine, also yields ten. Earth has hardness and softness, so doubling six makes twelve. Combining four and eight, or two and ten, also yields twelve. The ten heavenly stems arise from the five phases having yin and yang; the twelve earthly branches arise from the six qi having hardness and softness. The five phases and six qi are fundamentally one qi.\n\nThe five phases in heaven become the five qi—rain, sunshine, cold, warmth, and wind. On earth, they become the five substances—water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. In heaven, rain corresponds to earth’s water; in heaven, sunshine corresponds to earth’s fire. Water and fire possess qi, while rain and sunshine possess substance. Rain and sunshine are heaven interfacing with earth; water and fire are earth interfacing with heaven. Two transform, while three remain unchanging. Two attain the correctness of yin and yang; three attain the mixture of yin and yang.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: The people have the six emotions—love, hate, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—born of the six qi. The people receive the qi of yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and brightness to live: yin is metal, wind is earth, rain is wood, darkness is water, and brightness is fire. Love arises from yang; hate arises from yin; joy arises from wind; anger arises from rain; sorrow arises from darkness; happiness arises from brightness.\n\nThus, heaven has six qi that descend to generate the five flavors. People consume the five flavors, corresponding to heaven’s six qi. Sorrow gives rise to weeping; happiness gives rise to song and dance; joy gives rise to giving; anger gives rise to conflict. Joy arises from love; anger arises from hate. When sorrow and happiness are not lost, one can harmonize with the nature of heaven and earth and thus endure long.\n\nIn my humble opinion: People’s qi endowments are uneven. Those who are hard may err in excessive hardness; those who are soft may err in excessive softness. One must first overcome and refine their biases. Among them, there is a type of person exceptionally fierce and resolute—this is encountering an excess of yang qi. There is a type of person extremely weak and timid—this is encountering an excess of yin qi. Some are restless, violent, and wrathful—this is encountering the malignance of yang qi. Some are cunning, deceitful, and treacherous—this is encountering the malignance of yin qi. Some have a nature that is adaptable, turning with a single touch. Some are stubborn and foolish, unable to accept even a single word of good advice, no different from beasts. All these arise from such qi endowments, not from the qi of yin and yang itself. Evil arises merely from the separation, combination, and transformation of qi. Within the unevenness, differences naturally form, giving rise to fragmented likes and dislikes.\n\nThus it is said: Heaven, earth, and humanity share one qi. When heaven reverses its seasons, it becomes disaster; when earth reverses its creatures, it becomes omen. When the people reverse virtue, it becomes chaos—this can move heaven and earth to produce omens. When things lose their nature and reverse the norm, they become omens.\n\nThe historian states: Omens and disasters include floods, droughts, famines, untimely cold and heat, thunder and hail as calamities, solar and lunar eclipses, comets and meteors, halos, mock suns, intersecting arcs, celestial phenomena like \"back holes\" and \"speech embraces,\" locust plagues, silkworm anomalies, misaligned constellations, landslides, earthquakes; yang qi suppressed and unable to emerge, yin qi oppressed and unable to ascend. The six qi congeal into ominous leaves, pestilential misfortunes, and blue omens—all reverse the norm to harm the people’s nature.\n\nThus, to transform inverted qi into harmonious qi lies solely with the ruler, who attains the Mean and Harmony to align heaven and earth. When yang returns, in the fifth month a single yin is born, becoming the initial line of *Kun*. In the sixth month, it retreats, and a second yin arises. In the seventh month, it closes, and a third yin arises, completing the three lines of *Kun* within. In the eighth month, it observes, and a fourth yin arises. In the ninth month, it strips away, and a fifth yin arises. Accumulating until the tenth month, the top line of *Kun* is reached, and the six yins are fully realized—then its number is exhausted and reverts to seven. Again, the initial line of *Kun* transforms into yang, and the hexagram is named *Fu* (Return). From *Shi* (Pregnancy), *Dun* (Retreat), *Pi* (Obstruction), *Guan* (Observation), *Bo* (Stripping), and *Kun* (Earth) to *Fu* (Return), it undergoes nearly seven changes, hence the saying \"seven days.\" This is the fundamental purport of the *Great Changes* and the orthodox interpretation of former scholars.\n\nYet the *Zhengyi* also cites the theory of \"six days and seven parts,\" aligning with Zheng Sinong’s reference to the *Yi Wei*, thus completing the hexagram qi. It further states: \"Confucius’s apocrypha are clear, and Wang Bi’s commentary is as such. Can Zheng Kangcheng’s explanation be reconciled?\" How, then, to regard these two theories? It is said: both are valid. The *Changes* encompass all phenomena, adapting with time to follow the Dao without exception. In interpreting the sacred canon, one should adhere to the orthodox interpretations of former scholars. Taking \"seven days\" as seven months is acceptable. To establish hexagram qi and rectify the degrees of the celestial sphere, using \"six days and seven parts\" is also unobjectionable. Both are preserved here to await future sages.\n\nHowever, Kong’s explanation in Wang’s transmission states: \"After the yang qi of heaven is extinguished, it revives within seven days.\" The phrase \"extinguished\" is somewhat dubious. Though yang qi may be subtle, how could it ever be extinguished? Moreover, Wang Kui’s account, from the fifth to the eleventh month, posits that the sun traverses seven celestial lodges, then abandons yang qi before it returns—this is incorrect. Little does he realize that the celestial sphere comprises twenty-eight lodges; the sun moves one degree per day, traversing one lodge per day, and its conjunction with the moon marks a month. Essentially, if the sun moves through seven lodges, it is seven months—how can one alter months to speak of days? To take the sun’s movement through one lodge as a single day is untenable. The distinction between \"seven days\" and \"seven months\" has been thoroughly examined by former scholars.\n\nIn my humble view: by the tenth month, one yang is stripped away, and from *Shi* to *Kun*, the six yangs are exhausted. By the eleventh month, at the midpoint of *Zi*, one yang is born. Taking yang as primary and counting it with the preceding numbers, it is said: \"In seven days, it returns.\" \"Seven days\" is thus seven months. Taking yin as primary, it is called \"months.\" From the fifth to the tenth month, six yins fully mature—this is merely six months. Thus, \"seven days\" is emphasized to manifest the principle of exalting yang.\n\nThere are three interpretations of *Fu* (Return), yet the underlying principle is one. Lianxi, focusing on the point of return in *Kun*, says: \"It is beneficial to be steadfast.\" His explanation of sincere return aligns with Wang Bi’s. Yichuan, focusing on the dynamic aspect at the inception of the *Yuan* character, says: \"It is the inception of movement,\" thereby revealing the heart of heaven and earth. Kangjie, addressing the interplay of movement and stillness, says: \"Between one movement and one stillness.\" Zhu Xi remarks that the principle is the same, though the points of reference differ.\n\nRegarding the *Fu* hexagram, the bottom line is precisely where movement occurs. How can one speak of stillness? Observing the image of thunder beneath the earth, Yichuan’s interpretation is correct. Though *Fu* has three divisions, its lines number six. Zhu Xi says: \"Heaven and earth have yin, thus there is return; the multitude have evil, thus there is return; the sage has no return.\" I also say: the multitude have return, the worthy do not stray far from return, and the petty person is deluded by return.\n\nSomeone asked Zhu Xi: \"Within utter stillness, if a single thought arises, is this return?\" He replied: \"Your question is inexhaustible. There is return of good and evil, and return of movement and stillness—these two must be clearly distinguished.\" In my view, the sage’s heart is a companion to creation. Like an infant, it does not lose the undifferentiated principle of heaven. Without interruption, who can perceive its arising and ceasing? This is called \"no return.\"\n\nDay after day, in ceaseless turmoil, the heart of compassion and shame suddenly stirs in a moment of awakening—this is the division of good and evil into yin and yang. Or, when a single thought arises from utter stillness, this is the division of movement and stillness into yin and yang. The human heart is inherently empty, luminous, and unobscured. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, recognizing it as the good heart and expanding it fulfills its capacity. When stillness is found within movement, discerning and suppressing what is not good eradicates evil by its root. Thus, human desires are entirely eliminated, and heavenly principle is ever-present. One may then progress from having return to aspiring to the sage’s state of no return.\n\nExtending this to the six lines of *Fu*: the first nine, \"not straying far from return,\" Confucius assigns to Yanzi. The remaining five lines do not specify individuals, for admonition and warning are subtly conveyed without explicit words—truth is thus revealed. It is said that Zixia, upon hearing criticism, rested in return; Zengzi reflected daily, Boyu yearly—these are frequent returns. Yi’s solitary return, Zhou Tu of Han’s earnest return—these attributions may be questionable. Lu Qi’s deluded return, however, aptly illustrates its peril.\n\nIn my view, beneath deluded return lie earnest, solitary, frequent, and resting returns—these are what Zhu Xi calls \"the multitude’s having return.\" Though their ranks vary in excellence, none match Yanzi’s learning of foreknowing the subtle. \"Conquering the self for a single day, the world turns to benevolence\"—the heavens open as if the clouds have dispersed.\n\nThe sage teaches by holding up the highest standard; for those of lesser capacity, one may proceed in order. The *Xiang* says: \"In seven days, it returns—this is the course of heaven.\" The explanation of \"seven days\" has been given above. Master Cheng says: \"Heaven’s movement, with its waxing and waning, is the principle of heaven.\" Master Hengqu says: \"Seven days and nights follow one another without interruption.\"\n\nMoreover, it is said: \"When the end comes, there is a beginning—this is the movement of heaven,\" which never ceases. To rectify it through stillness—what fixed term could there be? This is movement within stillness, movement that knows no exhaustion. What is more, from the inception to the dissolution of a cycle, from the origin of heaven and earth to the present, it has ever been thus. For stillness gives rise to movement, and heaven, without intent or action, governs nothing. Being perpetually so, how could it ever rest? If one contrives or arranges stillness, how could it endure? From this, it departs.\n\nMaster Zhu says: \"When *Bo* reaches its extreme, it becomes *Kun*. Yang descends and enters *Kun*. When the extreme moves, yang ascends and emerges, traversing the six yin lines. When it reaches the extreme and returns to the beginning, this is the course of the sun, the moon, and the year. The numbers of heaven, earth, and the Five Phases cannot be defied. And again, it is said to be seven days—this clarifies the origin of pitch and calendar. Thus, the sun, moon, and five planets begin in *Qianniu*. Qi begins at midnight, the calendar begins at the winter solstice, and pitch begins with *Huangzhong*. Yang Xiong grasped this and composed eighty-one chapters to exhaust the numbers of one *yuan*, six *jia*, three systems, nine gatherings, and two hundred forty-two sections. Shao Yong grasped it and thereby elucidated the origins, conjunctions, evolutions, and epochs of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, exhausting the boundless numbers of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning.\n\nIn my humble view, Master Cheng’s explanation of the principle of heaven’s waxing and waning is concise and precise. Master Zhang’s account captures the grandeur of the phenomenon, stating that the yang qi circulates even in the depths of winter without ever ceasing—all deduced from the generative principle of *Qian* and *Kun*. As for Hanshang, he elucidates principle solely through numbers, using the seven-day cycle to infer the origins of pitch, calendar, and hexagram qi, as well as the theory of the winter solstice and midnight. He further cites the *Tai Xuan* and *Huangji Jingshi* to expand upon this. Thus, *Fu* not only clarifies principle but also encompasses number.\n\nMaster Zhu has said: \"Heaven and earth are fundamentally the circulation of a single qi, manifesting as movement and stillness. In terms of the essence of this circulation, it may simply be called *Qian*, which encompasses all. When divided into movement and stillness, it becomes yang odd and yin even. Whether vast as heaven, earth, sun, moon, and stars, or minute as years, months, days, hours, cold, heat, day, and night, all are encompassed.\" Thus, the coming of yang and the going of yin in *Fu* fully embodies the meaning of heaven’s movement from end to beginning.\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: \"*Fu* is small yet discernible among things.\" A single yang sprouts in the Yellow Palace, beneath the host of yin—its beginning is as fine as a thread of silk. Yet amidst the multitude of yin, it does not intermingle, like a speck of white in darkness. The white is discernible, and the mass of black cannot obscure its whiteness. Like the sun not yet risen above the earth, even when hidden within the earth, it cannot be contained. Viewed through human affairs, it is like Yanzi: though deemed foolish, among the three thousand disciples, none failed to call him worthy. Thus, Master Zhu says: \"When the good in a person first sprouts, though small, the multitude of evils cannot suppress it.\"\n\nMaster Xu says: \"*Fu* is the incipient moment of returning to goodness. One must, at the first stirring of thought, in what others do not know and only the self knows, carefully examine this incipient moment and return to goodness. Acting in accord with principle, one becomes a noble person; violating principle, one becomes petty. If one fails to discern this clearly, then in matters, a hairsbreadth of deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles. How can one not stand in awe?\"\n\nMaster Cheng says: \"Yang has no principle of exhaustion. When it changes above, it is born below. There is no interval where it can be contained—this is its rest.\" When *Bo* is exhausted, it becomes pure *Kun*. How could there still be yang? If hexagrams are matched to months, this corresponds to the tenth month. In terms of qi’s waxing and waning, yang’s exhaustion forms *Kun*, and yang’s return forms *Fu*—yang is never exhausted. Thus, the tenth month is called the \"yang month,\" lest one doubt the absence of yang.\n\nMaster Cheng Bozi said: \"The gloss of *xi* as 'birth' refers to one matter: when there is rest, one matter is born, with no interruption in between.\" Master Zhu further said: \"When *Bo* is exhausted and becomes *Kun*, a single yang immediately arises below without any discontinuity. This reveals that heaven and earth have no place of rest. For example, in a month of thirty days, the single yang of *Fu* is divided into thirty parts. It gradually accumulates from these thirty days, one part at a time. From the *Xiaoxue* period after the tenth month, with each central qi, one part of yang is born daily. As one part is extinguished above, one part is born below. In all cases of yin and yang’s generation, one line corresponds to one month. Only after thirty days are fulfilled does that space become complete, forming one line. Now, the *Kun* hexagram is not devoid of yang—its beginning is merely exceedingly subtle. Before that space is filled to form a line, it is not that *Kun* is purely yin without yang. This is not an abstruse matter, yet Yichuan did not explain it clearly to others, compelling them to undertake a great endeavor. Initially, a few words were lacking to convey the gradual waxing and waning, the inseparability of yin and yang.\"\n\nMaster Zhu says: \"The single yang of *Fu* does not arise suddenly. Rather, it accumulates from the *Kun* hexagram. It is not that at the midnight of the winter solstice, the yang suddenly arises. Precisely at the midpoint of *zi*, the calculation of that single yang is completed. After the midpoint of *zi*, the second yang begins to arise, gradually forming two yang. After a month, it becomes *Lin*. Master Zhu further said: \"From *Guan* to *Bo*, thirty days pass before *Bo* is exhausted. From *Bo* to *Kun*, another thirty days pass before *Kun* is complete. Over thirty days, yang gradually grows, reaching one yang at the winter solstice. The second yang then begins to diminish yin. Each day, one-thirtieth of yin is exhausted, and after a month, it is fully exhausted. As yang grows, each day one-thirtieth of yang is added, and after a month, one yang is fully formed. During the exhaustion, each day of twelve *ke* gradually diminishes in full. One day exhausts one-thirtieth. The gradual growth of yang is likewise—each month’s crescent and full moon reveal how yin and yang thus successively arise.\"\n\nThe yin does not deplete all at once, nor does the yang grow all at once. In the ninth month, yin reaches its extreme, and yang has already begun to arise below, though it has yet to take form. The six yang lines divide into six segments, and each segment further divides into thirty parts. Even the smallest segments must accumulate incrementally, and only at the winter solstice does one yang line fully form. The top line of *Bo*’s *nine at the top* is divided into thirty parts, with one part depleted each day until the end of the ninth month, when it is fully exhausted. The same applies to yin.\n\nThis can be understood by observing gestation, though the sages did not speak of it thus. It is further said: Within the space between heaven and earth, qi exists in six layers. This qi ascends and descends, rising and falling. At the winter solstice in the eleventh month, it begins to arise from the lowest layer, ascending all the way to the sixth. By the fourth month, when it reaches the heavens, the yang qi, having just fully formed, begins to dissipate. It is this single qi that rises and falls in endless circulation, moving through the six layers. All arising is but yang qi. When yang grows by one part, it does not borrow from yin; rather, where yang dissipates, yin naturally emerges.\n\nThus, the arrival of yang is *Fu* (Return), and *Fu* is the original state of things. The arrival of yin is *Gou* (Stain), and *Gou* is but an accidental encounter. It is further said: In the hexagram *Fu*, the single line at the bottom is movement. Master Cheng said: \"Since ancient times, Confucians have spoken of stillness as revealing the heart of heaven and earth, but I alone say that movement reveals it.\" Someone asked: \"Is this not seeking stillness within movement?\" He replied: \"Indeed. Yet it is most difficult to speak of a 'movement' before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure have arisen. Stillness may be spoken of, but how can one apply the word 'movement'? Stillness must involve some thing to be called so—this is where the difficulty lies. What is stillness like?\" He said: \"It cannot be called 'nothing,' yet there is awareness. If there is awareness, then it is movement—how can it be called stillness? One who speaks well of the heart can observe the heart of heaven and earth in this.\"\n\nI say: Before thoughts arise, it may indeed be called stillness. Master Zhu said: \"The movement of heaven flows without a moment’s interruption—how could there be a month without yang? Yet once it reaches fullness, it transforms; once it transforms, it changes. The great cycle spans a year and a month; the small cycle, a day and an hour—all follow this pattern. Like a tree whose leaves yellow and fall, the moment they fall, new buds have already sprouted. Trees that remain green in winter first grow new buds before their old leaves fall. When it comes to transformation, heaven and earth are never without change—not only in a year, but in a month; not only in a month, but in a day; not only in a day, but in an hour. It is only that people do not perceive it.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why does the *hard fruit* not fall?\" He replied: \"Simply by not falling, it contains the principle of life. As Master Yichuan said: 'Yang has no principle of complete exhaustion; when it transforms above, it arises below.' *Nine at the top* of *Bo* is the image of the old yang above, the hard fruit. Earlier scholars spoke of peach pits and apricot kernels: the kernel inside the pit, when planted, sprouts—hence it is called *qi*. The kernel is the heart of heaven and earth in generating things; it is not a dead thing. The *Yi* speaks of *qi* only in the hexagrams *Fu* and *Qian*, revealing the heart of heaven and earth in generating things. From the first yin’s dissipation, *Qian* advances to *six in the fifth*, reaching its extreme. *Qian* represents wood and fruit; the yang essence solidifies above, and the *hard fruit* is the greatest of solid things—it appears when *Bo* reaches its extreme. When it reaches the top, it turns downward, and *Gen* inverted becomes *Fu*. Yang arises within the earth, then grows and becomes *Qian*—this is the image of the *hard fruit* that does not fall.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"*Fu* speaks of *qi* days to return—when things reach their extreme, they must reverse. This is the principle: there must be life and death, beginning and end. As it says: 'Bending and stretching, coming and going—it is only principle.' One must not take the qi that has just bent as the qi that is now stretching. It is naturally ceaseless. When things disperse, their qi is exhausted, and they cannot return. This is the principle of the original source. Heaven and earth are like a great furnace, melting and refining everything to exhaustion. How could the qi that has already dispersed return to the workings of creation? It is the life-generating qi that is used, not the already-dispersed qi. It is like the sea tide: when the sun rises, it ebbs; when the moon rises, it flows—not that the already-ebbed water becomes the tide.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"*Seven days* is taken only for the meaning of seven; *eight months bring misfortune* takes the meaning of eight, calling it *return*. It is not that the yang of the past is brought back anew to regenerate the old. What has passed is gone; the new naturally arises from it. The great virtue is earnest in transformation, flowing like a river without ceasing—how could it rely on the already-dissipated qi as the resource for what is now arising? It only shows that it perishes there and arises here, thereby revealing the image of its coming and going.\"\n\nMaster Cai said: \"Yang’s dissipation begins in the month of *Jianwu* (the fifth month) as *Bo*, and by the month of *Jianzi* (the eleventh month), it becomes *Fu*. The hexagram passes through seven lines, and the months pass through seven months. It does not speak of months but of days, just as in the *Book of Songs*: 'the first day, the second day.' Mr. Guo of Lushan said: '*Qian*’s *initial nine* returns at *jiazi*; the work of the year begins at the midnight of the winter solstice. The movement of the seven celestial bodies returns to the beginning of *Ox* (the lunar lodge), extending to the records of calendrical pitch-pipes. The sequence of the four seasons all reaches this point—thus the Yellow Bell is the root of all things. Therefore, when yang rises by one, all things are born; when yin rises by one, all things die. Their reversal and return complete the six positions, and the seasons are formed.\"\n\nThe *Yi* takes stillness as its root; heaven and earth take non-intention as their heart. Stillness follows *Kun*; movement follows *Zhen*. Thunder within the earth is the end of stillness and the beginning of movement.\n\n*Fu* governs movement, not stillness; *Shun* governs stillness, not movement. Master Li of Shizhai further stated: \"A single yin arises at *wu*, and the sun travels the southern celestial path. As soon as it reaches the southernmost point, it returns; upon returning, a single yang arises at *zi*, and the sun travels the northern celestial path—this is the winter solstice. Yet the initial yang is as faint as a thread, insufficient for action. It must pass through seven days to attain the number of *shaoyang* within the single yang, gaining three and a half parts out of fifteen. Only then does yang grow robust enough for action. Thus it is said: 'After seven days, the celestial movement returns.' The *hexagram* *Zhen* arises from the firm below, and life cannot be restrained. Only when plants wither and fruits fall to the earth do buds split their sheaths and the impulse of life return. *Yu*’s compliance in movement follows principle before qi; *Fu*’s movement in compliance follows qi before principle.\"\n\nMaster Liu said: \"The celestial movement cycles through twelve stages: yin traverses six, and yang traverses six. When yin reaches six and yang loses its position to seven, yang returns to its proper place. This is the cycle of the twelve celestial stages, revolving endlessly. The same pattern applies to years, months, days, and hours.\" Hanshang said: \"Judging by the waxing and waning of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, a single day from noon to midnight returns to the *zi* hour; a single year from the fifth month to the eleventh month returns to the *zi* month. In terms of one cycle, from the *wu* year it takes nearly seven years to return to the *zi* year. The movement of the celestial Dao naturally follows this pattern, forming a single cycle. Divided into years, months, days, and hours, it is invariably the same. Thus the sixty hexagrams correspond to 360 days, with each pair of hexagrams separated by seven days. The sages preserved the 'seven days’ return' in the *Fu* hexagram to clarify the *qi* of the hexagrams.\"\n\nSomeone asked the foolish one: \"How does Master Shao’s *solstices* relate to exhalation and inhalation?\" The reply: \"After the winter solstice is exhalation; after the summer solstice is inhalation. Exhalation brings forth all things; inhalation draws them in. One year is one exhalation and inhalation—the great opening and closing of heaven and earth. After midnight is exhalation; before dusk is inhalation. Exhalation and inhalation unite yin and yang, forming a single whole in humans. In one day and night, a person has 13,600 breaths. Daytime exhalation responds to all affairs; nighttime inhalation brings the silence of the myriad sounds. Heaven and earth return to the single body, where exhalation and inhalation depend on speech and silence. *Fu* and *Gou* alternate, yang ascends and yin begins to yield. Thus, in the great process of transformation, one *yuan* of 129,600 years is no more than a single year’s span.\"\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Fifteen, concludes.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Sixteen, compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai, collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu.\n\n**On the Origins of Numerology**\n\nThe study of numerology began with Fuxi, who drew the trigrams based on the *Hetu* (River Chart). Over seven hundred years later, Yu governed the floods and obtained the *Luoshu* (Luo River Writing). Another eleven hundred years passed before Jizi composed the *Hongqian*, clarifying the nine categories of the *Luoshu*. Confucius was born in the twenty-first year of King Ling of Zhou (gengxu), five hundred seventy years after Jizi. At seventy, he appended the *Xici* to the *Book of Changes*, elucidating the numerology of the *Hetu* within the fifty-five. Another fifteen hundred years passed before the *Huangji Jingshi* (Supreme Principles Governing the World) emerged. Its numerology did not devolve into mere elaboration because it was rooted in Fuxi’s pre-cosmic trigrams and their derivations. Those who do not speak of numerology find the pre-cosmic sufficient to encompass it. Thus, the transmission of numerology traces back: Fuxi received it and drew the trigrams; Confucius received it and expounded the *Dayan* (Great Expansion); Shao Yong (Kangjie) received it and composed the *Huangji Jingshi*. Its origins and evolution are ever more evident.\n\nAs for Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan*, Wei Yuan’s *Yuan Bao*, and Sima Guang’s *Qianxu*, they grasped only one facet of the *Changes* and did not attain its ultimate depth. Yet the numerology of the *Huangji Jingshi* is rarely mastered in the world, for its roots lie in *qi*, and its myriad transformations are difficult to fathom—unlike principles, which, once clarified in the mind, remain constant and easy to uphold. Thus, Confucius taught people only to \"exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny.\" When principle is clear, numerology is contained within it. Yet if numerology is unclear, principle is not easily refined.\n\nConfucius said: \"My Way is threaded by one.\" This suffices. Master Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is principle; yin and yang are *qi*. Movement and stillness are the mechanisms upon which they ride. *Qi* moves, and principle moves with it.\" Master Cai said: \"*Qi* is numerology. In the obscure and boundless, before the first signs emerge, lies the origin of numerology. The division of the One into Two marks the separation of numbers.\" I say: Before the Supreme Ultimate moves, *qi* is not yet manifest—how could numerology exist? Yet within the steadfast One, the Three are already latent. At the first stirrings of yang’s movement, a faint and indistinct numerological essence arises within, though it remains unmanifest. Where movement becomes evident, the One becomes distinct. When movement stabilizes and stillness ensues, the Two emerges. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement resumes, the Three is born. When movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns, the Four appears. From One to Three, and Three to Nine, yang numbers flow forth, giving rise to all things. From Two to Four, and Four to Eight, yin numbers congeal and solidify, forming the images of all things.\n\nThose who discern the mechanism see clearly and cultivate at the subtle, continuous point of yang. By steadfastly abiding until yin numbers—seven, eight, nine, and six—are reached, no errors arise, and all becomes auspicious. Yet if one’s heavenly mandate is predetermined, yang *qi* may sink into yin *qi*, giving rise to the nature of *qi*-quality. The noble person seeks to transform this by expanding and nurturing the yang goodness of principle. Thus, sages and worthies do not speak of destiny, focusing instead on principle to uphold the world’s teachings. Yet ultimately, they cannot escape it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of Four Greatnesses, which, together with the sage, make Five. Nothing surpasses heaven and earth in modeling the law; nothing surpasses the four seasons in facilitating transformation; nothing surpasses the sun and moon in displaying luminous images; and nothing surpasses milfoil and tortoiseshell in bringing about the auspicious and inauspicious in the world. Heaven and earth, the four seasons, the sun and moon, milfoil and tortoiseshell—all are manifestations of numerology. Without sages, how could one know heaven and earth as Three and Two, the four seasons as seven, eight, nine, and six, the days as one month, the *Hetu* as two, the *Luoshu* as ten, the tortoiseshell as nine, or the use of forty-nine out of fifty? This is the preparation of things for use, the creation of implements for the benefit of the world—nothing surpasses the sage, who dwells at the center and presides over all.\n\nThus, it is said: \"The sage emulates, images, and models them.\" It is also said: \"The *Changes* has four images, by which it reveals.\" Before Fuxi, there were no *Hetu* or *Luoshu*, only the natural *Changes* of heaven and earth. Thus, the *Hetu* is the *Changes* drawn by heaven and earth. The *Changes* is yin and yang, ceaseless transformation and alternation. Principle and numerology are inseparable—all are the natural *Changes*. At the dawn of chaos, when people were simple and most knowledgeable, heaven displayed these numbers through the sun, moon, and stars above, while earth presented them through the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* below. Fuxi, the first to arise, revealed these numbers to humanity. From Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, they were transmitted in an unbroken line to the present. Branches and leaves are drawn from the root, and within branches and leaves, the root is sought. Though myriad transformations differ, the One remains. Those with insight should devote themselves to this.\n\nI note: The *Records of the Grand Historian* states that Fuxi first drew the eight trigrams, created written characters, and replaced knotted cords. The Yellow Emperor’s teacher, Da Nao, investigated the essence of the Five Phases and first devised the *jiazi* (sexagenary cycle). He commanded Rong Cheng to create the calendar and establish numerology. Bamboo from Xiegu was used to listen to the phoenix’s song: the male’s six cries became the six *lü* (yang pitches), and the female’s six cries became the six *lü* (yin pitches). From the harmonious sounds of *gong* and *shang*, the numerology of *lü* and *lü* arose. Before Wu Huai and Tian Huang, records are distant and obscure. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states that from the beginning of creation to the capture of the lin, nearly 3,276,000 years passed.\n\nThe ten epochs span nearly seventy-six thousand years. Had Fuxi not drawn the trigrams and established numerology, how could generations be recorded? Cai Jitong remarked that Shao Kangjie’s calculations originated with Fuxi—this must be thoroughly understood. Master Zhu said: \"He merely perceived a principle and drew a few strokes; how could he have arranged them with such swift ingenuity? Had he arranged them one by one, it would not have been the intent of Heaven.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Fuxi was most pure and sincere; he created the eight trigrams—where would there be such swift and ingenious arrangement?\"\n\nIt further says: The Five resides at the center, serving as the *qi* of Heaven and Earth in equilibrium. The celestial Five dwells at the pole of the celestial sphere, threading through the four seasons; the terrestrial Five resides at the center of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, governing the four directions. In the diagram, five points represent Earth at the center. The outer four points are: Water in the north, Fire in the south, Wood in the east, and Metal in the west.\n\nWithin the *wu-si* pitch, the *Huangzhong* note holds the central position. The notes of the four seasons—*jue* in spring, *zhi* in summer, *shang* in autumn, and *yu* in winter—each differ, except for this central note, *gong*. Jing Fang’s pitch regulator consists of twelve strings, with the central string as *Huangzhong*, remaining unmoved; the twelve strings then resonate in response. The Five resides at the center of the twelve months, and when doubled, the Five never departs from the center.\n\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. The *Dayan* calculation uses fifty, with the central Five as the *qi* of Heaven and Earth in equilibrium. The void at the center, formless and undifferentiated, is the Supreme Ultimate. When it divides, the first signs of form and transformation emerge—this is the primordial *qi* of Heaven. The initial transformation emerges in the north to generate Water, hence Water’s number is one. This \"one\" as a number derives from its status as the first transformation.\n\nThe second transformation emerges in the south to generate Fire, hence Fire’s number is two. This \"two\" as a number derives from the second transformation of one. The third transformation emerges in the east to generate Wood, hence Wood’s number is three. This \"three\" as a number derives from the third transformation of one. The fourth transformation generates Metal in the west, its number four, likewise deriving from the fourth transformation of one. Though two, three, and four all derive their names from one, they are collectively called the \"generative numbers.\" Yet this one, having initially emerged from the Five to generate, ultimately returns to the Five to complete its internal formation. Internal and external, generation and completion, are unified in the Five Phases. Thus it is said: Earth is the *qi* of equilibrium, the essence, the ruler of the Five Phases. The Five generates and completes itself, initially requiring nothing. That which is completed by the Five is also doubled to become ten.\n\nIn the *Luo River Writing*, whether vertical, horizontal, or curved, all do not depart from three and five—this is the same principle. This celestial number Five, multiplying without decline and entering without loss, accomplishes transformations and moves spirits.\n\nThe *Dayan* number is fifty, of which forty-nine are used. The *ce* of *Qian* number 216, and the *ce* of *Kun* number 144, together total 360, corresponding to the days of a year. The *ce* of the two hexagrams total 11,520, corresponding to the number of all things.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Dayan* number is the origin of calculation methods. Thus, the foundation of calculation arises from nothing more than squares, circles, curves, and straight lines. Yang has no ten; yin has no one. Multiplication is the generative number; division is the dissipative number. Though calculation methods are many, they do not exceed these.\n\nZhang said: Yin and yang are nothing more than waxing and waning; calculation is nothing more than multiplication and division. Multiplication is the application of two. Squares, circles, curves, and straight lines are the four forms. The *Dayan* employs the Four Images as the origin of calculation. Yin ascends and yang descends within the Four Images, resulting in six.\n\nThis fool says: Seeking it in the Primordial Heaven, the circle of Heaven has the number three, and its transformations proceed: three to six, six to seven, seven to nine. The square of Earth has the number four, and its transformations proceed: four to eight, eight to six, six to nine. Heaven becomes Earth, Earth becomes Heaven. The interweaving of curves and straight lines, their numbers interlocking and alternating, yield inexhaustible transformations.\n\nThe *Yi* has its methods: *Qian* uses the old yang nine, *Kun* uses the old yin six. The *Dayan* uses four, the number of the Four Images. Four multiplied by nine yields thirty-six, the *ce* number of one line in *Qian*. Six multiplied by thirty-six yields 216, the *ce* number of one hexagram in *Qian*. Alternatively, multiplying thirty-six by six also yields this number. Four multiplied by six yields twenty-four, the *ce* number of one line in *Kun*. Six multiplied by twenty-four yields 144, the *ce* number of one hexagram in *Kun*. Alternatively, multiplying twenty-four by six also yields this number.\n\nThirty-six multiplied by four also corresponds to the *ce* of the two hexagrams. Thirty-two yang hexagrams have 192 yang lines, each line thirty-six. Thirty-two yin hexagrams have 192 yin lines, each line twenty-four. Multiplying 216 by thirty-two: thirty-two times two hundred yields 6,400; thirty-two times ten yields 320; thirty-two times six yields 192. Combined, they total 6,912—the number obtained by multiplying 216 by thirty-two.\n\nMultiplying 144 by thirty-two: thirty-two times one hundred yields 3,200; thirty-two times forty yields 1,280; thirty-two times four yields 128. Combined, they total 4,608—the number obtained by multiplying 144 by thirty-two. This explanation is indeed detailed and clear.\n\nMoreover, each yang hexagram contains 216, and multiplying this by the thirty-two yang hexagrams likewise yields 6,912. Each yin hexagram contains 144, and multiplying this by the thirty-two yin hexagrams likewise yields 4,608. Combined, they total 11,520—is this not simpler and easier?\n\nThe *Yijing* employs the old to enact change, hence the counting rods of *Qian* and *Kun* are used. Yet if one combines the counting rods of the two lesser hexagrams from the two Wings, the result is the same. This pertains to a fundamental principle in the study of the *Yijing*, which scholars must not overlook.\n\nConfucius appended this method to the *Yijing*, yet later Confucians failed to explain it with clarity and concision. Shao Kangjie once received this transmission from Chen Tuan, but over time forgot it. One night, he was instructed in a dream and regained it—yet even this was difficult, let alone for later students. Now I am old, and after delving into these calculations, I have recorded them in detail here. If students of the *Yijing* grasp this, then the numbers may be effortlessly unraveled.\n\nThe numbers beneath the earth cannot be reckoned. Yet the old and young of yin and yang, of heaven and earth and humanity, and the sixteen images of four-by-four can all be deduced by analogy. Only the numbers beneath the earth remain hidden and difficult to infer. Thus it is said: the subtle images in the world, the forms upon the earth, and the spirits dwelling in the unseen—none are not bound to number; it is merely that people do not perceive them.\n\nThe correct tones and numbers operate upon the earth and no further, for on the summer solstice, the sun rises in *yin* and sets in *xu*. Thus the three hours of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* descend beneath the earth, and their numbers are unseen.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Kangjie once exhaustively explored flavors numbering 21,600—something no human could blend. Colors number 28,800—something no human could dye. These are all natural, singular numerical patterns, yet only half are obtained. For yang tones arise only when the sun emerges above the earth, and their numbers are reckoned only until the sun sets beneath it. This is all reasonable.\n\nWhere there is speech, there is form; where there is form, there is shadow concealed. How enduring is shadow? The *Guabian* states: one, two, three, four—these numbers lie beneath the earth. At five, they emerge above it. Only then do the beginnings of human life appear, with signs visible to the eye. By six, seven, eight, and nine, they become manifest.\n\nThe sages relied on the numbers of heaven and earth to uphold yang and suppress yin. The heavenly number is twenty-five, the earthly number thirty—these are the fundamental numbers of heaven and earth. Earth exceeds by five, hence the *Dayan* number of fifty is employed. Heaven exceeds by ten—why? It is the sages’ way of upholding yang and suppressing yin.\n\nTwo and eight, four and six—these are the numbers of earth, yielding only two. One and nine, three and seven, five and five—these are the numbers of heaven, yielding three. Thus the heavenly number is thirty, exceeding earth. Moreover, the yang number three advances to employ the greater number of thirty, while the yin numbers four and six retreat to employ the lesser number of twelve.\n\nFrom this, we deduce: heaven three and earth two make five; heaven six and earth four make ten; *Qian* nine and *Kun* six make fifteen. *Qian* yields thirty-six, *Kun* yields twenty-four. *Qian* obtains six times seven, totaling 252—the time of generating life. *Kun* obtains only three times six, totaling 108—merely to restrain life.\n\nThe sages established these numbers by relying on the flowing transformations of creation—how profound and subtle! Zhen Xishan recorded the words of Cai Yinjun, saying: \"The *Yijing*’s images embody the workings of heaven and earth. The *Fan*’s numbers record them. Numbers begin with the odd one; images are completed by the even two. The odd is how numbers operate; the even is how images stand. Thus two by four makes eight—the images of the eight trigrams. Three by three makes nine—the numbers of the nine categories.\n\nEight by eight, multiplied again by eight, yields 4,096, and the images are complete. Nine by nine, multiplied again by nine, yields 6,561, and the numbers are exhaustive. The *Yijing*’s images were revealed through four sages, while the *Fan*’s numbers were bestowed upon Yu the Great by the gods, yet they were not transmitted. Later scholars, ignorant of the origins of images and numbers, either derived numbers from images or contrived images from numbers, forcing interpretations and obscuring the natural numerical patterns.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s eight trigrams, when expanded, form 4,096 images—Jing Fang exhaustively detailed them. Cai Zhongmo said: \"My late father said that the *Luoshu* is the origin of numbers. Without understanding numbers, one cannot discuss images. Without understanding images, one cannot discuss numbers. The two cannot exist without each other. Images are employed through the even, and when there is resonance, it is auspicious. Numbers are employed through the odd, and when there is opposition, it is inauspicious.\n\nThe even represents the mutual opposition of yin and yang as images. The odd represents the alternating operation of yin and yang as numbers. One is the ancestor of nine; nine is the ancestor of eighty-one. One and nine form a beginning and end as one—just as the year begins and ends at the winter solstice. The nine numbers divide into nine circles; when rotated and counted, the eight solar terms are complete.\n\nTwo by two marks *Lichun*; three by three, *Chunfen*; four by four, *Lixia*; five by five, *Xiazhi*; six by six, *Liqiu*; seven by seven, *Qiufen*; eight by eight, *Lidong*; nine by nine, *Dongzhi*. When the nine numbers conclude, one is reborn—generation upon generation without end. Yin ends and yang begins; day ends and night begins; the year ends and spring begins. The end of the former heaven and earth is the beginning of the latter—all without departing from the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*.\n\nOne by nine makes nine; nine by nine makes eighty-one; eighty-one by nine makes 729; 729 by nine makes 6,561—and the numbers are complete.\"\n\nThe movement of odd numbers establishes the foundation for the forms of even numbers. Thus it is said: the eight trigrams and nine palaces serve as each other’s exterior and interior.\n\nSomeone asked about the primordial numbers. Master Zhu replied: *The Great Commentary* has already explained this in detail. The *Kun* hexagram of Earth is the ancestor of the sixty-four hexagrams. The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the origin of numbers, the source from which the sages drew the trigrams.\n\nOne view holds: The Supreme Ultimate is the origin of principle, while the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the ancestors of numbers. From Heaven One to Earth Ten, Fuxi used the numbers of the *Hetu* to draw the trigrams. The fifty-five are the numbers through which Confucius elucidated the numbers of heaven and earth. The fifty of the *Dayan* are the numbers of the milfoil stalks. The 360 of *Qian* and *Kun* are the numbers of the annual cycle. The 11,520 are the numbers of the myriad things—all are primordial numbers. The numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* encompass all without exception.\n\nKing Wen ordered the *Yijing*, placing *Qian* and *Kun* at the beginning. The alternation of yang’s odd and yin’s even lines begins with the division of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams. Thus, when Fuxi drew the primordial trigrams, he began with *Qian* and ended with *Kun*, enclosing the sixty-two hexagrams within them. This is because the numbers of all things under heaven are encompassed within *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\n*Qian* is Heaven, and its number begins with one. One contains three, and three times three makes nine. All the odd numbers of the world—one, three, five, seven, nine—are derived from this. Thus, the Dao of *Qian* completes the male, giving rise to the *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* trigrams, which disperse through the four seasons. Whether human or thing, all receive the qi of *Qian*.\n\n*Kun* is Earth, and its number begins with two. Three times two makes six, containing twelve lines in its midst. All the even numbers of the world—two, four, six, eight, ten—are derived from this. Thus, the Dao of *Kun* completes the female, giving rise to the *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* trigrams, which disperse through the four seasons. Whether human or thing, all receive the qi of *Kun*.\n\nOne odd and one even, forming yin and yang, the male and female interlock—all through the numbers of four nines, four sixes, four sevens, and four eights. Generation and transformation flow abundantly within, circulating without cease. Counting forward or backward, all movements converge with these numbers.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves left in sequence, which is why the five phases generate one another. The Dao of Heaven moves right in reverse, which is why the five phases overcome one another. Overcoming is the means by which they complete one another. Thus it is said: The numbers of the *Yijing* are completed through reversal. *The Commentary on the Trigrams* states: The *Yijing* counts in reverse. It also says: Counting what has passed is sequence; knowing what is to come is reversal. This is what it means.\n\nMaster Shao said: Before thoughts arise, even spirits and gods do not know. If not from me, then from whom? Master Yi said: Only with Kangjie did numerology fully attain principle. Master Liu Yunzhuang said: The lines of the *Yijing* arise from the Supreme Ultimate, and thus its principles are the most refined under heaven. The *Yijing* originates from the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, and thus its numbers are the most mutable under heaven. Principle is established only when it has something to rely upon; though it does not depend solely on the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, it also does not depart from them.\n\nHe also said: Ten is two fives, or three threes with one added. Subtract three from ten and you get seven; subtract two and you get eight; subtract one and you get nine; subtract four and you get six. Six is then increased by four, nine by one, and seven by three. Advancing and retreating, expanding and contracting—all movements converge with these numbers. The four images do not depart from ten.\n\nIn terms of division: one divides into two, two into four, four into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, and thirty-two into sixty-four. Thus it is said: Dividing yin and dividing yang, alternating the yielding and the firm. Ten divides into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, a thousand into ten thousand, and so on—ten ten-thousands into a hundred thousand, ten hundred-thousands into a million, ten millions into ten million, ten ten-millions into a hundred million, and below a hundred million: *shu*, *rang*, *gou*, *jian*, *zheng*, *zai*, and *ji*. Fifteen names in all, yet none depart from ten.\n\nRoots have trunks, trunks have branches, branches have leaves. The larger they grow, the finer they become; the finer they become, the more numerous they grow. Yang, beginning with *Zhen*, grows until *Qian* and then divides; yin, beginning with *Xun*, arises until *Kun* and then contracts. Growth, division, decline, and contraction—this is simply the movement of the ten numbers.\n\nThus, Master Cheng said: Two and five combine to accomplish the work of yin and yang. Master Shao said: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the ancestors of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Xun*, *Dui*, *Gen*, and *Zhen* are the ancestors of the twenty-eight hexagrams. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, along with the doubled hexagrams *Zhongfu*, *Yi*, *Xiaoguo*, and *Daguo*—eight hexagrams in all that do not change—are the ancestors of the thirty-six hexagrams. The thirty-six hexagrams are the two sets of eighteen hexagrams in the upper and lower canons.\n\nThe *Dui*, *Xun*, *Zhen*, and *Gen* trigrams are transformations of the two original hexagrams, and thus are the ancestors of the twenty-eight changing hexagrams. Twenty-eight: among the thirty-six hexagrams, eight do not change, while twenty-eight do. Observing them in reverse yields fifty-six hexagrams. Why then speak of thirty-six hexagrams?\n\n*Qian* is one and *Kun* is eight. Among a hundred numbers, sixty-four hexagrams are taken as the body, and thirty-six as the function. One to ten is complete, and ten to a hundred is complete. *Kun*’s position above yields thirty-six for function, and below yields sixty-four for body. The inner yin lines complete the body’s numbers, totaling a hundred. Ten recedes by eight, and eight eights make sixty-four. Eight recedes by two, and six sixes make thirty-six.\n\nSome hexagrams contain seven within nine: four nines (thirty-six) contain four sevens (twenty-eight). Some hexagrams contain eight within seven: four sevens (twenty-eight) contain seven eights (fifty-six).\n\nSome hexagrams contain sixty-four within eight: this refers to the eight lower hexagrams remaining unchanged while being doubled to form sixty-four—condensing the expansive. There are those where the Dipper contains three within: when the sixty-four hexagrams are observed in reverse, only thirty-six remain—expanding the condensed. Some conceal nine within eight, yielding one eight, two sevens, three sixes, four fives. This is also called the intersecting numbers of four nines, where all nine bodies are concealed within eight. Thus their forms are inexhaustible. Some conceal nine within ten: the Nine Categories contain the numbers of five nines, with nine matters in substance. The Six Adversities attach to the Five Fortunes, so ten is unseen and concealed within nine. When function conceals form, its use is unceasing.\n\nIt is also said: *Qian* employs thirty-six hexagrams, so each line also contains thirty-six numbers. *Kun* employs twenty-four hexagrams, so each line also contains twenty-four numbers. The sixty-four hexagrams correspond to a year’s three hundred sixty days. *Qian*’s one hexagram has six lines, each line thirty-six numbers, six lines totaling two hundred sixteen—this is the line count of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Kun* is allotted twenty-four hexagrams, complementing *Qian* to complete the sixty-four. Each line has twenty-four, six lines totaling one hundred forty-four—this is the line count of *Kun*’s twenty-four hexagrams. Together, *Kun* and *Qian* complete three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven’s numbers employ seven. Of heaven’s ten numbers, seven is for use, three for intersection. Earth’s numbers employ twelve, eight for use, four for intersection. *Qian*’s original single line, multiplied by thirty-six, yields two hundred sixteen. Now adding six to its numbers. *Kun*’s original single line, multiplied by twenty-four, yields one hundred forty-four. Taking one portion to offer *Qian*, it uses only three sixes—one hundred eight—corresponding to the three hours of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*. One day, one month, one year—all these numbers move beneath the earth and are not employed by humans.\n\nAt times, seven of ten parts are used, following heaven’s use, referring to the Ten Celestial Stems. At times, seven, eight, or nine of twelve parts are used, following earth’s use, referring to the Twelve Earthly Branches. Using seven, two hundred ten are for use, one hundred fifty for intersection. Using eight, two hundred forty are for use, one hundred twenty for intersection. Using nine, two hundred seventy are for use, ninety for intersection. Thus it is said: the numbers of days follow heaven, the numbers of hours follow earth. Numbers have excess and deficiency, arising between the two solstices.\n\nFrom the hours’ two thousand one hundred comes the yang extreme, the surplus of qi. Yang gains six days—these are the mid-month qi of each month. Six becomes twelve, and yang advances twelve days to make one hundred twenty. From the hours’ two thousand one hundred sixty comes the yin extreme, the new moon’s deficiency. Yin contracts six days—these are the new moon’s deficiencies of each month. Six becomes twelve, and yin retreats twelve days to make one hundred twenty, totaling two hundred forty. Paired with twelve to make twenty-four, the great cycle’s standard number is sixty days per division, while the intercalary number is six days per division. These are distributed among the twenty-four qi, with twelve mid-month excesses and twelve new moon deficiencies, totaling twenty-four—dividing the cycle into four. Day and night divide their use, thus employing two hundred fifty-two.\n\nIt is also said: numbers have form and function. Form numbers generate beings and belong to earth; function numbers govern movement and belong to heaven. The form number is three hundred eighty-four, comprising sixty hexagrams. The line count is three hundred eighty-four, with four as form, so three hundred sixty lines are for function. Adding the sixty-four hexagrams, preserving *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*’s four hexagrams—twenty-four lines—governing the twenty-four qi, then three hundred sixty lines serve as a year’s function. Preserving ninety lines as form, fifteen hexagrams’ two hundred seventy lines are the numbers of heaven and earth’s function—these are the numbers of *yin* opening and *xu* closing. Preserving one hundred lines as form, eighteen hexagrams’ two hundred fifty-two lines are the numbers of earth’s surface function—these are the months from *yin* to *you*, including intercalary months. Excluding the hexagrams of the three palaces *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, one hundred eight days—form contains function, function contains form.\n\nPreserving the Supreme Ultimate’s form, the remainder is heaven’s function. Preserving heaven’s form, the remainder is earth’s function. Preserving earth’s form, the remainder is humanity’s function. The actual functional number is two hundred sixty-four—this is the number of pitch pipes, humanity, and beings. Two hundred fifty-six is the number of *Kan* and *Li* generating beings, adding four to earth’s form number two hundred fifty-two to make six, so two hundred fifty-six days have three thousand seventy-two hours—all times for generating beings. Beings are born of yang, so only yang strategies are employed. *Qian*’s yang is thirty-six, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Xun* together total eighty-four. *Kun* is twelve, *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* together total sixty. Altogether, the eight positions’ yang lines total one hundred ninety-two, plus the original generating four numbers of sixty-four, making two hundred fifty-six.\n\nIt is also said: of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding the initial and top lines and using only the four middle lines, two hundred fifty-six are also obtained. Using four positions refers to the four earthly forms. *Kan* has four yin lines, *Li* has four yang lines—thus generation of beings necessarily employs four. *Qian* and *Kun* establish positions above and below, while *Kan* and *Li* mate within them, serving as the masters of generating beings, gestating their essence and spirit. Excluding the initial and top lines and using only the middle lines is because heaven and earth do not generate beings at dawn and dusk but do at midday, and earth’s north and south do not generate beings but do at midday. If *Li* were not preserved, the four yang lines would have no way to receive *Kun*’s yin. If *Kan* were not preserved, the four yin lines would have no way to accept *Qian*’s yang. Thus each excludes four to establish form. Excluding four means they are constantly preserved yet unused, while two hundred fifty-six are employed.\n\nThe initial line is the qi of earth, the root of life. In the *Precelestial Chart*, the thirty-two yang and thirty-two yin lines that remain unchanged are the initial lines left unused. The top line is the spirit of heaven, the origin of nature. Thus, the eight pure hexagrams evolve through five generations to become the \"wandering soul\" of heaven, and the top line of the *Yijing* does not move.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Yijing* possesses variable numbers, and hexagrams possess variable images. Heaven’s number contains three; doubling three makes six, and tripling three makes nine. Nine times nine is eighty-one, the extreme of yang numbers. At its extreme, yang transforms into yin. Earth’s two doubled makes four, and four times four is sixty-four, the extreme of yin numbers. At its extreme, yin transforms into yang.\n\nThere are hexagram transformations: one change yields three—*Qian* transforms into *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*; *Kun* transforms into *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. One change yields eight—*Qian* shifts from *Gou* to *Tai*, and *Kun* shifts from *Bo* to *Pi*. Among the hexagrams of the three outer sons and three outer daughters, one shares the same variable hexagrams, as observed through the casting of yarrow stalks. Obtaining the two elders’ nine-six changes results in *Qian* and *Kun*. Obtaining the two youths’ seven-eight unchanged lines results in *Zhen*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*.\n\nThere are line transformations: for example, *Kun* changes one line to become *Fu*, and when all six lines change, it becomes *Qian*. Another method involves the mutual ascent of one yang line as a transformation, yielding *Fu*, *Shi*, *Jian*, *Yu*, *Bi*, and *Bo*. There are also transformations of two yang lines, comprising fifteen hexagrams, all derived from *Lin*. Transformations of three yang lines comprise ten hexagrams, all derived from *Tai*.\n\n*Qian* changes one line to become *Gou*, and when all six lines change, it becomes *Kun*. Another method involves the mutual transformation of one yin line, generating *Gou*, *Fu*, *Lü*, *Xiaoxu*, and *Dayou*. There are also transformations of two yin lines, comprising fifteen hexagrams, all derived from *Dun*. Transformations of three yin lines comprise ten hexagrams, all derived from *Pi*. These describe transformations of lines and hexagrams.\n\nThe eight trigrams’ transformations, eight times eight, culminate in sixty-four. The sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations, sixty-four times sixty-four, culminate in four thousand ninety-six hexagrams. By extrapolating hexagram lines, these are twelve-line hexagrams. Extending to twenty-four lines yields seventeen million seven hundred seventy-seven thousand two hundred sixteen hexagrams.\n\nFurthermore, in the *Precelestial Chart*, one change yields two hexagrams, two changes yield four, three changes yield eight, four changes yield sixteen, five changes yield thirty-two, and six changes complete the sixty-four hexagrams. The square and circular *Precelestial Charts* correspond precisely. Thus, Master Shao states below: \"Changes within correspond to responses without; changes without correspond to responses within. Changes below correspond to responses above; changes above correspond to responses below.\"\n\n*Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* with twenty-eight yang lines correspond to *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen*’s twenty-eight yin lines. *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen*’s twenty yang lines correspond to *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*’s twenty yin lines. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Xun*, and *Kan* occupy the upper position, while *Li*, *Zhen*, *Gen*, and *Kun* occupy the lower. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* are internal, while *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun* are external. As yang wanes and yin waxes, each hexagram mirrors the other, and there is no change without correspondence.\n\nChange follows heaven. Heaven moves leftward, and the sun shifts one degree; the response follows the sun’s daily rightward movement, with heaven responding one degree. All correspond left and right. The sun’s path is marked by stars—*Qian* and *Li*; the moon meets the celestial stems—*Dui* and *Zhen*; fire arises from earth—*Kun* and *Kan*; fire lies hidden in stone—*Gen* and *Xun*. All correspond above and below.\n\nFlying creatures perch on trees—*Li* and *Gen*; walking creatures rely on grass—*Zhen* and *Kun*; heart and lungs connect—*Qian* and *Xun*; liver and gallbladder adjoin—*Dui* and *Kan*. All correspond internally and externally. Thus, in the *Yijing*’s six lines, the first and fourth correspond, the second and fifth correspond, and the third and sixth correspond, always in opposition.\n\nHeaven and earth envelop each other; the female and male summon one another. Heaven is yang, earth is yin; heaven’s pitch corresponds to earth’s tone. Heaven’s voice initiates, and earth responds. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* reside in the northwest, initiating earth’s sixteen hexagrams—five, six, seven, eight—in the southeast. They further intersect with the sixteen hexagrams of the southwest—*Pi*, *Dun*, *Song*, and *Shi*—constituting the transformations of heat and cold, day and night, the natures and forms of walking, flying, and plant life. The sixteen hexagrams of movement combine to form two hundred fifty-six hexagrams, their positions aligning with thirty-four changes. All successes and failures, virtues and flaws of animals arise from this.\n\nEarth’s tone harmonizes with heaven. *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* reside in the southeast, harmonizing with heaven’s sixteen hexagrams—one, two, three, four—in the northwest. They further intersect with the sixteen hexagrams of the northeast—*Tai*, *Lin*, *Yi*, *Fu*—constituting the transformations of rain, wind, dew, and thunder, the natures and forms of walking, flying, and plant life. The sixteen hexagrams of vegetation combine to form two hundred fifty-six hexagrams, their positions aligning with thirty-one changes. All flourishing and withering, blossoming and fruiting of plants arise from this.\n\nThe hexagrams of the southwest, observed from left to right, pertain to animals. Animals’ lives reside in the head, attached to heaven, with yang arising below. Among the thirty-two hexagrams below, all lines face upward—life resides above. Thus, humans’ heads are above, while birds and beasts are born horizontally. The hexagrams of the northeast, observed from top to bottom, pertain to plants. Plants’ lives reside in the roots, attached to earth, with yin arising above. Among the thirty-two hexagrams above, all lines face downward—life resides below. Thus, humans’ kidneys are below, while grasses and trees grow inverted.\n\nThen, pairing them with the hexagrams of sound: the voices of the sun, moon, and stars belong to heaven’s one hundred twelve hexagrams. The tones of water, fire, earth, and stone belong to earth’s one hundred fifty-two hexagrams.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven and earth undergo sixteen changes, totaling six hundred seventy-two divisions of waxing and waning. Heaven’s eight leftward changes, from *Zi* to *Si*, constitute daytime, with three hundred thirty-six as the number of growth.\n\nEarth’s eight rightward changes, from *Wu* to *Hai*, constitute night, with three hundred thirty-six as the number of waning. Together, the two eights make sixteen changes. Heaven governs the body, its eight changes culminating in sixteen. With *Qian* as the master, proceeding from *Yang* onward, two hexagrams correspond to one change, *Tongren* to eight changes, and *Shen* to sixteen changes.\n\nHeaven and earth each divide into eight changes, each yielding the number three hundred thirty-six—the total line count of fifty-six hexagrams. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Daguo*, *Xiaoguo*, *Zhongfu*, and *Yi*, twenty-four lines remain. Dividing twenty-four by two yields twelve, which is the surplus of six days in the yang count. For the six yin months, totaling one hundred eighty days, excluding the twenty-four lines of *Kun*, *Kan*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo*, twenty-four lines remain. Dividing twenty-four by two yields twelve, which is the deficit of six days in the yin count. Together, the twenty-four lines excluded account for the three hundred thirty-six, combining into six hundred seventy-two divisions of waxing and waning. This also corresponds to the changes of seven, six, five, and four.\n\nThe generative numbers of the eight trigrams: *Qian* as one, *Dui* as two, *Li* as three, *Zhen* as four, *Xun* as five, *Kan* as six, *Gen* as seven, *Kun* as eight.\n\nMaster Cai states: Yang generates yin, two multiplied by six becomes twelve. Yin generates yang, three multiplied by ten becomes thirty. Thus, *Qian* begins with one, and *Dui* becomes twelve; *Li* becomes twelve and thirty, totaling three hundred sixty; *Zhen* becomes twelve and four thousand three hundred twenty. From *Xun* to *Kun*, all are the generative numbers of odd and even. Applying these to the twenty-four hexagrams and multiplying their generative numbers reveals the total sum. From *Dui* to *Zhen*, the number reaches one hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred twenty. I have calculated this before.\n\nYang, as one, is odd; yin, as two, is even. Thus, the number of one *yuan* begins with *Qian*, the origin of all counts, just as one year encompasses years, months, days, and hours. After *Qian* comes *Dui*. *Dui* represents the moon, its number two. Expanded, it becomes twelve—one year has twelve months. After *Dui* comes *Li*. *Li* represents the sun, its number three. Expanded, it becomes three hundred sixty—one year has three hundred sixty days. After *Li* comes *Zhen*. *Zhen* represents the hours, its number four. Expanded, it becomes four thousand three hundred twenty—one year has four thousand three hundred twenty hours. These one, two, three, and four are the primordial numbers of heaven and earth’s creation, where yang precedes yin by one.\n\nAfter *Zhen* four comes *Xun* five. Nothing precedes this as the primordial qi of yin. This is the year count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, the origin of all counts. *Kan* six follows, representing the month count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to one million five hundred fifty-five thousand two hundred months. *Gen* seven follows, representing the day count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to forty-six million six hundred fifty-six thousand days. As for the hour count of *Xun*, it resides in *Kun* eight, further expanded to fifty-five million nine hundred eighty-seven thousand two hundred hours. These five, six, seven, and eight are the concluding numbers of heaven and earth’s completion, where yin follows yang.\n\nThus, layering and expanding these to eight: *Qian*’s world count is four thousand three hundred twenty, expanded to fifty-five million nine hundred eighty-seven thousand two hundred. *Dui*’s world count is fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty, expanded to six hundred seventy-one million eight hundred forty-six thousand four hundred. Proceeding in order, all can be clearly discerned. Generally, the numbers of *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* encompass those of *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. From *Zi* to *Si*, the six upper branches belong to *Qian*, called *xiantian* (Prior Heaven). From *Wu* to *Hai*, the six lower branches belong to *Kun*, called *houtian* (Posterior Heaven). Posterior Heaven emulates Prior Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Forming the image is called *Qian*; emulating the model is called *Kun*.\" One may infer the rest from this.\n\nTwelve and thirty are used interchangeably. The twelve months of a year arise from one year multiplied by twelve. The three hundred sixty days of a year arise from twelve multiplied by thirty. The four thousand three hundred twenty hours of a year arise from three hundred sixty multiplied by twelve. The thirty *shi* of a world arise from one *shi* multiplied by thirty. The three hundred sixty months of a world arise from the world count multiplied by thirty. The ten thousand eighty days of a world arise from the world’s days multiplied by thirty. The one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred hours of a world arise from the world’s days multiplied by twelve.\n\nThe twelve branches and twelve stations correspond to the numbers three, four, two, and six. Doubling twelve yields three, eight, four, and six. The yin number two expands to twelve: twelve branches, twelve hours, twelve months, twelve worlds, twelve hexagrams. *Kun* has twelve lines; humans have twelve components—thus earth’s numbers begin with twelve. The twelve branches are the branch numbers and month numbers. From *Zi* to *Si* is yang; from *Wu* to *Hai* is yin—this is two sixes, divided by generation and completion. From *Zi* to *Xu* is yang; from *Chou* to *Hai* is yin—this is also two sixes, divided by odd and even. Twelve yin and yang each form half, splitting one into two and dividing the twelve. Four threes and two sixes: the four seasons each split into three, further dividing the two sixes. Twenty-four corresponds to the twelve qi of the months. Eight nodes: one node has three qi. Four seasons: one season has six qi.\n\nThe lines of the eight trigrams in Prior Heaven’s one palace each total forty-eight, divided among the four directions to correspond to the four phases.\n\nThe central void of twelve corresponds to earth, aligning with the four directions. In *Jiazi*, it holds twelve; in *Zhouyi*, one hexagram; in *Kun*, twelve yang remain; in *Qian*, twelve yin remain. Forty-eight is twelve. Subtract twelve and use thirty-six as old yang. From *Yin* to *Xu*, three are used and one unused—twenty-four: remove four sixes and use four sixes as old yin. From *Mao* to *Shen*, remove six and use six, each half. Twenty-eight: remove four fives and use four sevens. Thirty-two: remove four fours and use four eights. Whether from the middle of *Yin* to the middle of *Xu*, or from *Mao* to *You*, the used always exceeds the unused, marking the advance and retreat of *Qian* and *Kun*. These twelve numbers divide day and night, and the moon’s waxing and waning. Advancing twelve days, yang gains; retreating twelve days, yin contracts. When yang gains, the surplus of qi divides six into one hundred twenty; when yin contracts, the deficiency of qi also divides six into one hundred twenty. Six days advance, sixty days advance—paired, they make twenty-four—hence the use of two hundred forty-two, two hundred fifty-two, and two hundred sixty-four. One year has sixty *Jiazi*; small, it is six hours; large, six days. Even larger, sixty years—all twelve. Thus it is said: \"Six *Jia* exhaust the heavenly Dao,\" and the moon uses thirty days as its mean. The midpoint of half a day is the conjunction of sun and moon. Excluding intercalary months also aligns with the numbers of one palace—though none have spoken of this before. *Qian* uses nine, *Kun* uses six. *Qian* and *Kun* advance and retreat within seven, eight, nine, and six. The body is four, the function six; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass both body and function. Thus thirty-six, transformed by four, becomes four nines; transformed by six, six sixes. Twenty-four, transformed by four, becomes four sixes; transformed by six, six fours. As for twenty-eight and thirty-two, they transform only by four and cannot transform by six.\n\nFrom the perspective of function: four sixes make twenty-four, the extreme of yin. Advancing six makes thirty, the middle of yang; advancing another six makes thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Six sixes make thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Retreating six makes thirty, the middle of yin; retreating another six makes twenty-four, the extreme of yin. From the perspective of body: six fours make twenty-four, the extreme of yin. Advancing four makes twenty-eight, then another four makes thirty-two, then another four makes thirty-six, old yang. Nine fours make thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Retreating four makes thirty-two, then another four twenty-eight, then another four twenty-four, old yin. Only *Qian* and *Kun* can advance and retreat, uniquely converging within seven, eight, nine, and six—used as the two elders of yin and yang. The six children cannot transform by six, so their use is not discussed.\n\nYang arises within yin, advancing from six to nine; old yin arises within yang. Retreating from nine to six, the changes of the two elders never depart from the four images. Thus, adding four to nine, eight, seven, and six yields the body’s numbers of four. Further deducing function from within the body, we have thirty-six, thirty-two, twenty-eight, and twenty-four. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams: sixty correspond to the six *Jia*, and four to the four seasons. The two elders and two youths each have their offices, yet yin can never precede yang. *Qian* is originally the number of six yangs, yet it can also incorporate half of *Kun* to become nine. Three threes make nine; nine nines, eighty-one. This is the number of old yang, beginning at three and culminating at nine. The numbers of old yin and the two youths are but nodes within it. Thus it is said: speaking of the body of one qi, it is called *Qian*, encompassing all.\n\nThe great *Yi* doubles its eighteen to divide the classic, totaling thirty-six. King Wen ordered it, Confucius aided it—revealing the utmost to humanity. Since the Han, none have been able to expound it. The *Jingshi* text doubles its two sixes to divide the epochs, totaling three hundred sixty. The great and small epochs, six advances and six retreats, manifest in years, months, days, and hours.\n\nZhang Guanwu said: The numerical method of twelve originates from the qi numbers of yin and yang, then divides. Three hundred eighty-four is the number of the body; three hundred sixty, the number of function. Ten uses seven, twelve uses eight—these are intersecting numbers. Yang gains six, yin contracts six—these are surplus numbers. One, three, five, seven, nine; two, four, six, eight, ten—these are the numbers of odd and even. Long numbers extend the small to the great, returning to *Qian*. Fractional numbers divide the great into the small, gestating into *Kun*. Further dividing one line of *Qian* descends into six hexagrams: *Dayou*, *Xiaoxu*, *Lü*, *Tongren*, and *Dun*—these are the images of *Qian*.\n\nMultiplying numbers: two multiplied by twelve always ends at two; three multiplied by three advances to thirty, always ending at six. Dividing numbers: divide one into two, two into four, four into sixteen. Subtracting numbers are diminishing numbers. Multiplying numbers are extending numbers. For example, yin multiplying yang, yang multiplying yin—three hundred sixty multiplied by three hundred sixty—yields one hundred nineteen thousand six hundred, as in one *yuan*.\n\nIt is also said: Hexagrams have a body derived from function, and function derived from body. The body derived from function begins with one yin and one yang, becoming two yins and two yangs, then four yins and four yangs. Four becomes eight, combining into twelve yins and twelve yangs. In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, the outer eight hexagrams descend from eight: eight yangs interspersed with eight yins, eight becoming sixteen.\n\nSixteen yins interspersed with sixteen yangs, sixteen becoming thirty-two. Thirty-two yins interspersed with thirty-two yangs, thirty-two becoming sixty-four. One hundred ninety-two yangs with eighty yins, one hundred ninety-two yins with eighty yangs. Taken together, the left side of the inner palace has sixty-four yangs and thirty-two yins, while the right side likewise has sixty-four yins and thirty-two yangs. In the upper palace, left and right each have forty-eight yangs and forty-eight yins. From body to function: from sixty-four to thirty-two, thirty-two to sixteen, sixteen to eight, eight to four, four to two, two to one. The One is the Supreme Polarity. This is the division of the Supreme Polarity, the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams.\n\nMaster Shao said: The body of Heaven and Earth has the number four, its function is three, and what is not used is one. He also said: Heaven’s four transformations contain Earth’s four transformations. Heaven and Earth each have four trigrams; the eight are merely four. Heaven is round and takes function as its master, while its body is subsumed under Earth. Earth is square and takes body as its master, while its function follows Heaven. Heaven pares four down to three, taking three as its function. Earth splits one into four, taking four as its body. From *yin* to *xu*, three are used and one is not—this is the old yang of four nines. From *mao* to *shen*, half are used and half are not—this is the old yin of four sixes. Four times four makes sixteen positions. Forms have the four directions, *qi* has the four seasons, and Heaven has the Four Images. Their transformations become cold and heat, day and night; containing Earth’s Four Images, they transform into rain, wind, dew, and thunder. Heaven is sufficient to envelop Earth. Heaven’s three doubled makes six, and six arises from one. Including the root makes seven; excluding the root makes six. Thus yang always preserves one to govern advance, advancing to thirty-six. Earth’s two uses twelve, and twelve arises from four. Including the root makes sixteen; excluding the root makes twelve. Thus yin always obscures one to govern retreat, retreating twelve months to diminish twelve days.\n\nTherefore, the great ultimate of Heaven turns rightward from Earth, while the primordial *qi* of Earth moves leftward from Heaven. It is also said: Three is thirty, and one-one is two sixes. This speaks of the numerical reckoning of yin and yang *qi* in one year. One year has four seasons, one season has three months, and one month has three decades. Following Heaven’s function with the heavenly stems: five days make one *hou*, and three *hou* (fifteen days) make one *qi*. Following Earth’s function with the earthly branches: six days make one *fen*, and three *fen* (twelve hours) make one day. In the large, one year encompasses three hundred sixty days, divided from thirty days. In the small, one month encompasses three hundred sixty hours, accumulated from thirty *fen*. One day transforms into thirty, one *hui* has thirty *yun*, and one *shi* has thirty years. Thirty twelve-hour periods make one month, twelve thirty-day periods make one year, thirty twelve-month periods make one *shi*, twelve thirty-year periods make one *yun*, thirty twelve-*shi* periods make one *hui*, and twelve thirty-*yun* periods make one *yuan*.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven’s six transformations generate three hundred sixty—this is the number of its movement. One transformation generates six, two transformations generate twelve, three transformations generate eighteen, four transformations generate twenty-four, five transformations generate thirty, and six transformations generate thirty-six. Thereupon, advancing to three hundred sixty. The number of Heaven’s movement takes one as its root. Using one with six requires no reliance on Earth. One transformation is sixty, and six transformations are three hundred sixty—this is spoken in terms of Heaven and Earth. Five generates six: one month has five trigrams, and one trigram has six lines. Five multiplied by six—five sixes—makes thirty. Excluding the four cardinal trigrams, one year has sixty trigrams, and six sixes make three hundred sixty lines. One year completes sixty *jiazi* cycles, also six sixes making three hundred sixty days. One transformation generates six; subtract one to make five, and five takes one as its root. Two transformations generate twelve; subtract two to make ten, and ten takes two as its root. Extending to three, four, five, and six transformations, always subtract their three, four, five, or six to preserve the root, yielding the numbers fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and thirty. Thus it is said: Five sixes generate thirty. Thirty trigrams correspond to Heaven’s six transformations, yielding one hundred eighty. In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, left and right are alike, each having five transformations generating thirty-two yangs and thirty-two yins. Five and six alternate, odd and even pair, and thus five and six are the central numbers of Heaven and Earth. The movement of the four seasons goes nowhere without harmonizing with them.\n\nCounting trigrams with the twelve branches, one transformation occurs every six days. Counting *hou* with the ten stems, one transformation occurs every five days. Sixty transformations generate three hundred sixty. Three hundred sixty multiplied by three hundred sixty yields the number of one *yuan*: one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred.\n\nIt is also said: Earth’s four transformations generate thirty-six—this is the number of generating things. Four generates twelve, twelve generates twenty, twenty generates twenty-eight, twenty-eight generates thirty-six, and thereupon advancing to two hundred fifty-six. The number of Earth’s generation takes four as its root and uses two with ten. Two splits one into four, splits four into sixteen, splits sixteen into sixty-four, and splits sixty-four into two hundred fifty-six—these are Earth’s four transformations. Sixteen is Earth’s four. One transformation into four is Earth’s one. Four generates eight: one four generates two fours, and combining them makes three fours—twelve.\n\nEight generates twelve: two fours generate three fours, and combining them yields five fours—twenty. Twelve generates sixteen: three fours generate four fours, and combining them yields four sevens—twenty-eight. Sixteen generates twenty: four fours generate five fours, and combining them yields four nines—thirty-six. Earth employs four transformations to reach nine, thereby generating things. Counting by six sixes governs Heaven’s movements; counting by four nines governs Earth’s generation\n\nA *hui* comprises thirty *yun*, totaling 46,656,000 *shi* and 1,399,680,000 *fen*, which amounts to 16,799,160,000 *miao*, corresponding to the *Lǚ* hexagram. A *yuan* comprises twelve *hui*, totaling 559,872,000 *shi* and 16,799,160,000 *fen*, which amounts to 201,553,920,000 *miao*, corresponding to the *Duì* hexagram. The number 129,600 constitutes a *yuan*: the years of a *yuan*, the months of a *hui*, the days of a *yun*, and the *chen* of a *shi* all share this number of 129,600.\n\nThe sixty *jiazi* cycle circulates within the Prior Heaven’s square and circular diagrams. The circular diagram represents Heaven; removing the four cardinal hexagrams and their twenty-four lines corresponds to 360 days, moving through the ten Celestial Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. The ten Stems correspond to Heaven’s ten days, while the twelve Branches correspond to Earth’s twelve months and twelve *shi*. Thus, five days make a *hou*, ten days make a *jia*, fifteen days make a *qi*, and thirty days make a month. *Jia* and *wu* transform through yang, *ji* and *gui* through yin—five transformations. *Wu* and *hai* transform through yin, *zi* and *si* through yang—six transformations. In a year, the *jiazi* cycle completes six-tenths; in a month, three *jia* cycles with five-sixths of another; in a year, thirty-six *jia* cycles yielding 360 movements, revolving through Heaven’s five to generate seventy-two. In a month, two *zi* with half of another, five-sixths of six; in a year, three sets of ten *zi*, also totaling 360 movements, revolving through Earth’s six to likewise complete seventy-two. On the left of the diagram, fifteen *zi*. Each *zi* undergoes two transformations, totaling thirty transformations—1, 3, 6, 180. The right is the same, also totaling 360. Thirty *fen* make a *shi*; 360 make the *miao* of a *shi*; 4,300 accumulate into a day. Again, taking months as years, two and a half days and thirty *shi* make a month. The thirty *fen* of a *shi*—each *fen* as a day, every *fen* with twelve *miao*, each *miao* as a *shi*. Condensing years into months, months into days, days into *shi*. Even 129,600 years are but the accumulation of the *fen* and *miao* of a single *shi*. Divided minutely, it extends to 16,799,616,000 *miao* and no further. Refined ever further, it enables the investigation of principles and the exhaustion of affairs. Ascending into the azure heavens, descending into the yellow springs, broadly containing primordial *qi*, minutely entering the boundless.\n\nMaster Yang Xiong once deduced this. Now, rotating the circular diagram reveals the expansion and contraction of emperors, kings, and hegemons; the order and chaos of past and present; the movements of the four seasons and myriad transformations; the revolutions of the sun, moon, and stars. *Qian* and *Kun* govern it, thereby illuminating Heaven’s numbers.\n\nThe square diagram represents Earth, structured by four. Counting by fours, reaching four nines, it turns to sixteen matters for clarification, extending to 256 positions for differentiation. Heaven’s voice initiates above as the six *lü* resonate; Earth’s tone responds below as the six *lü* answer. Creatures that run, fly, and plants all correspond to these numbers. *Kan* and *Li* govern its movements, with four yin and four yang generating beings on Earth.\n\nThe Prior Heaven’s study begins from the center of the diagram. The great pivot of creation is all the marvel of spontaneity. Master Shao should have contemplated this with profound insight, never departing from it even for a day. Master Cheng said: *\"The Book of Changes* reckons in reverse. To foresee the unmanifest as if it were past, what need is there for divination?\" Yet numbers are principle. Principle has its inevitabilities, such as the three or five generations. Rarely does it err—numbers cannot escape principle. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, abandoning principle to speak of numbers has long led to apocrypha. Only Master Kangjie spoke of numbers to reach principle, aligning with the movements of Heaven and Earth. Effortlessly compliant, vast in its return. As he said: \"Before the diagram, there was *zi*; after *wu*, there is no change.\" If numbers are thus, principle is also thus. I say: exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny. Principle is primary, yet numbers are within it. Though the Master did not speak of destiny, he said, \"If the River does not yield the Diagram, I am done.\" If numbers are unclear, principle is also obscured. Thus, Master Shao said: \"Learning that does not connect Heaven and humanity cannot be called learning.\" The noble person should attain its utmost.\n\nI say: the numbers of the world arise from principle; violating principle leads to mere calculation. Master Zhu said: \"Though Master Kangjie’s methods differ, in essence, they are the hexagrams drawn by Fuxi.\" The *Records of the Historian* state: \"Those who embody the compositions of Heaven and Earth reach their culmination in *The Book of Changes*.\" The odd lines of Heaven and even lines of Earth, the yang nine and yin six, the 4,096 hexagrams’ changes, the 11,520 counting rods—what more can be added? Thus, the sun, moon, stars, water, fire, earth, and stone exhaust the substance and function of Heaven and Earth. Cold and heat, day and night, rain, wind, dew, and thunder exhaust the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Nature, emotions, forms, bodies, creatures that run, fly, and plants exhaust the responses of the myriad things. The *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, *shi*, years, months, days, and *chen* exhaust the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. Emperors, kings, hegemons, *The Book of Changes*, *The Book of Songs*, *The Book of Documents*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals* exhaust the achievements of sages and worthies. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, there has been only one such master. The essentials of numerical study:\n\nHeaven as one, Earth as two.\nHeaven’s odd: one-one; Earth’s even: two-two.\nHeaven has no ten; Earth has no one.\nOne, three, five—three heavens, thus *Qian* uses nine.\nTwo, four—two earths, thus *Kun* uses six.\nOne is the body of Heaven’s roundness.\n\nFour is the body of Earth’s squareness.\nHeaven’s roundness has a diameter of one and a circumference of three, accumulating to eight, corresponding to the eight directions and four corners.\nEarth’s squareness arises from four and accumulates to twelve, each one employing three.\nThus, the four directions divide into twelve stations, and the four seasons divide into twelve months.\nHeaven is one and becomes two, with yin and yang proceeding together.\nEarth is two and becomes four, with yin and yang splitting into pairs.\nHeaven’s roundness begins with one and accumulates to eight; Earth’s squareness begins with four and accumulates to twelve.\nThe number of the round is odd, so Heaven’s number is one and employs six.\nThe number of the square is even, so Earth’s number is two and employs twelve.\nHeaven transforms the square into the round, ever preserving its oneness.\nEarth divides two into four, ever holding to its squareness.\nYang governs advance, so Heaven combines one to make seven.\nYin governs retreat, so Earth removes four to make twelve.\nThe round begins with one and accumulates to six; the square divides one into four.\nThe round trims the square for its use, so one transforms into four.\nFour minus one leaves three; three transforms into nine; nine minus three leaves six.\nThe operational number is completed in three and reaches its limit at six.\nThe square expands the round for its body: one transforms into three and combines with four; four transforms into twelve and combines with sixteen.\nThe structural number is completed in four and reaches its limit at sixteen.\nHeaven governs use, so it conceals one within forty-nine.\nThat fifty displays the center yet conceals one means the number inherently contains it.\nEarth governs structure, so it reveals four beyond sixty.\nThat sixty hexagrams exclude four externally means the number inherently lacks it.\nThe sun transforms once every thirty days; the moon transforms once every twelve.\nIn one year, the sun gains six days; in one year, the moon loses six days.\nOne solar year has three hundred sixty-six days; one lunar year has three hundred fifty-four days.\nHeaven arises from one; Earth is completed in four.\n*Qian*’s one line envelops *Kun*’s two lines to make three; *Qian*’s three lines envelop *Kun*’s six lines to make nine.\n*Qian*’s one line contains thirty-six yang; *Kun*’s one line contains twenty-four yin, totaling sixty.\n*Qian*’s one line: six sixes make thirty-six; six advances by one to seven, so six lines yield two hundred fifty-two.\n*Kun*’s one line: four sixes make twenty-four; four retreats to three, yielding three sixes one hundred eight.\nOf *Kun* relative to *Qian*, one hundred takes three, so three hundred sixty takes one hundred eight.\nEarth’s use lies in Heaven, so it conceals one at the beginning.\nHeaven’s body lies in Earth, so it hides four at the end.\nFocusing on Heaven’s one, yang advances and yin retreats.\nFocusing on Earth’s two, yin and yang alternately advance and retreat.\nHeaven is three, Earth is four: Heaven’s one, three, five make nine; five fours make nine.\nEarth’s one, two, three make six; two fours make six.\nHeaven’s use employs three hundred sixty.\nEarth’s structure comprises three hundred eighty-four.\nHeaven’s roundness prioritizes use, its body relying on Earth.\nEarth’s squareness prioritizes structure, its use following Heaven.\nHeaven’s three threes make nine; Earth’s three twos make six.\nHeaven doubles three to make six; Earth doubles four to make eight.\nHeaven’s generative numbers are one, two, three, four; Earth’s completed numbers are six, seven, eight, nine.\nHeaven’s six sixes make thirty-six; Earth’s four sixes make twenty-four.\nHeaven divides its three, so the sun has thirty days, advancing to three hundred sixty days.\nEarth begins with two, so the moon has twelve months, dividing into twenty-four qi.\nHeaven’s operational number is three and reaches its limit at six; Earth’s structural number is four and reaches its limit at sixteen.\nHeaven is three, Earth is two; Heaven is seven, Earth is three.\nHeaven has three celestial bodies; Earth has four phases.\nThe precelestial four corners are *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Dui*, *Xun*.\nThe postcelestial four corners are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*.\nHeaven is three, Earth is two—these are the fundamental operational numbers of Heaven and Earth.\nThree and two, two and three—these are the mutually employed numbers of *Qian* and *Kun*.\nThe North Star emerges thirty-six degrees above Earth; the rest remains hidden.\nThe South Star sinks thirty-six degrees below Earth; the rest remains visible.\nHexagrams employ six lines, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines.\nThe four positions of the Zhou encompass two hundred fifty-six.\nThe two sons, with twenty-eight yang, generate *Qian* Father’s thirty-six yang; the three daughters, with twenty-eight yin, generate *Kun* Mother’s thirty-six yin.\n*Kun* Mother, with twelve yang, generates each of the three sons’ twenty yang; *Qian* Father, with twelve yin, generates each of the three daughters’ twenty yin.\nWithin *Kun* twelve yang are concealed; upon reaching *Qian*, they complete thirty-six yang.\nWithin *Qian* twelve yin are concealed; upon reaching *Kun*, they complete thirty-six yin.\n*Qian* totals three hundred sixty-three, dividing its use by two to form the number of opening things.\n*Kun*’s four sixes make twenty-four, removing one and retaining three to form the number of closing things.\nHeaven’s bell has Earth’s three and two; Earth’s bell has Heaven’s two and three.\n*Qian* envelops *Kun*’s even to make three; *Kun* divides the yang number to make six.\n*Qian* governs sixteen hexagrams as odd; *Kun* governs twenty-four hexagrams as even.\nYin is two and incomplete;

three hundred sixty hexagrams divide into structural transformations—eight eights make sixty-four, yielding four thousand nine hundred twenty hexagrams.\nThirty-six are Heaven’s operational hexagrams; sixty-four correspond to Earth’s structure.\nIn the *Precelestial Diagram*, the left is Heaven, three hundred thirty-six parts in extension.\n*Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, *Qian* extend; *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Kun* diminish.\nThe right is Earth, three hundred thirty-two parts in diminution.\n*Xun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, *Kun* extend; *Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, *Qian* diminish.\nHeaven exceeds Earth, so the sage upholds yang as the odd number—thus Heaven is three, Earth is two.\nEarth exceeds Heaven, so the Supreme Ultimate’s initial division begins with the primordial numbers—thus yang is one, yin is two; Heaven is five, Earth is six; Heaven is five, Earth is ten; Heaven is six, Earth is four; Heaven is four, Earth is six.\n\nSix is Heaven’s operational number. Twelve is Earth’s operational number. Heaven’s transformations proceed through six qi in six changes. Earth’s transformations proceed through four bodies in four divisions. Heaven’s number is twenty-five, combined as fifty, corresponding to the tallying numbers. Earth’s number is thirty, combined as sixty, corresponding to the hexagram numbers. Heaven’s six operational numbers belong to yang; Earth’s eight structural numbers belong to yin.\n\nHeaven’s six changes yield six times six, thirty-six periods. Earth’s four changes yield four times four, sixteen positions. Heaven’s number six, each line thirty-six: halved, three times six makes eighteen changes. Five times six makes thirty days; six times six makes three hundred sixty. Earth’s number two, each line twenty-four: halved, two times six makes four times forty-eight lines; six times seventy-two seasonal markers; sixty times six likewise yields three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven stores its operations in six; Earth manifests its power in eight. Heaven has six changes, with three yielding six. From six to thirty-six, these are Heaven’s six changes. Earth has four directions, with two yielding four. From four to two hundred fifty-six, these are Earth’s six changes. Heaven encompasses Earth, thus employing six changes: one change sixty, six changes three hundred sixty. Earth does not encompass Heaven, thus employing four changes: one change four, two changes sixteen, three changes sixty-four, four changes two hundred fifty-six.\n\nSix as the operational number belongs to yang; eight as the structural number belongs to yin. Six times six constitutes the operational use of the thirty-six hexagrams. Eight times eight constitutes the structural body of the sixty-four hexagrams. Earth follows Heaven in employing five; Heaven follows Earth in employing six.\n\n*Qian* and *Dui* correspond to spring, with fifty-six yang and forty yin. *Kan* and *Gen* correspond to autumn, thus the inverse. *Qian* and *Xun* correspond to summer, with sixty-four yang and thirty-two yin. *Kun* and *Gen* correspond to winter, thus the inverse. *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* hold six yang and twelve yin; *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* hold six yin and twelve yang.\n\n*Qian* governs surplus, completing a year’s three hundred sixty days. *Kun* governs deficiency, contracting by six days to remain whole. Heaven’s number twenty-five, combined as fifty, advances to one hundred. Earth’s number thirty, combined as sixty, advances to one hundred twenty.\n\n*Qian* totals two hundred fifty-two, the operational number of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Kun* totals one hundred eight, the intersecting number of the twenty-four hexagrams. From the fifty tallying numbers, remove one, dispersing it into forty-nine for use. Within use lies structure: beyond the sixty hexagrams, four remain—four as the body of the sixty hexagrams. Within structure lies use: Heaven seven, Earth eight. Heaven employs seven; Earth’s body is eight.\n\nHexagrams with six times six belong to use, attributed to yang lines, transforming into eight. Eight belongs to structure, attributed to yin hexagrams, opening things through *Qian*’s operation. In the eighth month, things close through *Kun*’s operation, dividing into three parts.\n\nHeaven nine, Earth ten. Heaven’s five and four make nine; three times three makes nine; nine times nine makes eighty-one; four times nine makes thirty-six. From *zi* to *si*, six to nine. From *wu* to *hai*, nine to six.\n\n*Qian*’s number is nine, yet Heaven employs six—nine grows from six. *Kun*’s number is six, yet Earth’s body is four—six arises from four. *Qian* employs nine: three times eight makes nine, yielding two hundred sixteen. Two times eight makes nine, likewise yielding *Kun*’s one hundred forty-four. *Kun* employs six: two times twelve makes six, yielding one hundred forty-four. Three times twelve makes six, likewise yielding *Qian*’s two hundred sixteen.\n\nHeaven culminates in nine, Earth exhausts in ten. Ninety marks the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. The numbers of the eight trigrams total thirty-six. One and eight, two and seven, three and six, four and five—all intersecting numbers are nine. To speak of ten is merely nine’s counterpart. Yang culminates in nine; yin ends in ten.\n\nHeaven’s ten arises from one becoming two, two and five making ten. Earth’s ten arises from two becoming four, two and eight making ten. Fifty takes one as its root, forty-nine as its use. Sixty-four takes four as its root, sixty as its use.\n\nHere concludes the sixteenth scroll of *Heaven’s Original Unfolding of Subtleties*.\n\nHere begins the seventeenth scroll of *Heaven’s Original Unfolding of Subtleties*, compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai, collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu.\n\n---\n\nThe blade, though sharp, cannot sever itself; the finger, though nimble, cannot touch itself. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless, cannot be fully grasped by the mind alone. Only when one attains stillness and emptiness does the spirit naturally abide within. The *Taiji* generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes give rise to the Four Images; the Four Images produce the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams govern the myriad things, each in its proper place.\n\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth unite to form one thousand two hundred. The numbers of the Three Powers combine to make one hundred eighty. The numbers of the Four Seasons total seventy-two. The numbers of the Five Phases multiply to thirty-six. The numbers of the Six Directions yield one hundred twenty. The numbers of the Seven Regulators amount to eighty-four. The numbers of the Eight Winds sum to sixty. The numbers of the Nine Palaces reach one hundred forty-four.\n\nThree times three makes nine; nine times nine yields eighty-one. Three times four makes twelve; twelve times twelve yields one hundred forty-four. Three times five makes fifteen; fifteen times fifteen yields two hundred twenty-five. Three times six makes eighteen; eighteen times eighteen yields three hundred twenty-four. Three times seven makes twenty-one; twenty-one times twenty-one yields four hundred forty-one. Three times eight makes twenty-four; twenty-four times twenty-four yields five hundred seventy-six. Three times nine makes twenty-seven; twenty-seven times twenty-seven yields seven hundred twenty-nine.\n\nThe Great Yang ascends, the Great Yin descends. Yang advances, yin retreats. The *Taiji* divides into the Three Primordials. The Three Primordials generate the Three Heavens. The Three Heavens give rise to the Three Qi. The Three Qi produce the Three Essences. The Three Essences form the Three Origins. The Three Origins complete the Three Powers.\n\nThe numbers of the Three Powers total one hundred eighty. The numbers of the Three Heavens amount to nine thousand. The Three Heavens contain the Three Qi; the Three Qi embrace the Three Essences. The Three Essences unite to form the Three Origins. The Three Origins combine to yield the Three Powers. The Three Powers harmonize to generate the myriad things.\n\nOne times one makes one; one times two makes two; one times three makes three. Two times two makes four; two times three makes six. Three times three makes nine. Six times nine yields fifty-four. Nine times nine yields eighty-one. Eighty-one times eight yields six hundred forty-eight. Six hundred forty-eight times one hundred forty-four yields ninety-three thousand three hundred twelve.\n\nThe Spirits and Gods\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (*Yijing*) reveals the mysteries of Heaven, Earth, spirits, and gods. It begins with the phrase on the obscure and the manifest, life and death, then proceeds to discuss spirits and gods. After Confucius’ commentary on the *Changes*, from Yan [Hui], Zeng [zi], Zisi, and Mencius down to the several masters of the Zhou [Dunyi], Cheng [brothers], Zhang [Zai], and Zhu [Xi], the teachings diverged. The two traditions of Śākya and Laozi departed from the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, presenting an entirely different view. Buddhism uses the fear of spirits to guide people, urging them to take refuge so as not to fall into the cycle of rebirth. Daoism employs transmission to entice people, promising that through cultivation one may attain longevity. Descending further into世俗俗 practices, people carve statues from wood and earth to enshrine them, or invoke spirits through the shamanic cries of mediums. Is this all there is? Who can truly fathom the traces of the creative transformations? Alas, how lamentable!\n\nMaster Cai Xie said: Spirits and gods are the wondrous workings within Heaven and Earth. One must take them as a subject for contemplation and enter into reflection to grasp them. The *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"Looking up, one observes the patterns of Heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of Earth. Thus one knows the causes of the obscure and the manifest. Tracing things to their origins and returning to their ends, one knows the explanations of life and death. Essence and qi become things; wandering souls undergo transformation. Thus one knows the conditions and forms of spirits and gods.\" This is to apply the principles of yin and yang from the *Changes* to observation.\n\nThe patterns of Heaven pertain to yang and thus are manifest; the principles of Earth pertain to yin and thus are obscure. The sun, moon, and stars are manifest, yet in the vast and distant reaches, there is also obscurity. Descending into the Yellow Springs, all is obscure, yet in the sprouting and flourishing of life, there is also manifestation. Coming forth from the origin pertains to yang, hence it is called life. Returning to the end pertains to yin, hence it is called death. Human life is measured by a span of a hundred years. If one preserves and nurtures properly, even in old age, the yang may remain robust. If not—even in one’s prime, one may decline. Thus, when yang is dominant, yang recedes and yin diminishes; the vitality of life overflows, the bent straightens, the withered flourishes, and in the radiance of wind and moon, all is harmonious and abundant—here one may perceive the conditions of the spirit. When yin is dominant, yin advances and yang recedes; the vitality of life contracts, the straight bends, the flourishing withers, and like a waning moon or a chilling wind, when the yang qi is exhausted, death ensues—here one may perceive the conditions of the ghost.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yang is solely concerned with generation. If there were no yin to bring about death, there would be life without end, and the creative transformations would nearly cease. Therefore, by examining the obscure and the manifest, one may know life and death. By examining life and death, one may know spirits and gods. One qi assumes myriad forms; one breath spans past and present. Comprehending the Dao of day and night, one may understand the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, whose inexhaustible source lies herein. Is this not the vital qi of the Great Ultimate? Alas! How subtle it is!\n\nSomeone asked: *\"The* Book of Changes *speaks of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and the four seasons, yet concludes with ghosts and spirits—this refers to the contraction and expansion of the two qi. Master Zhou speaks of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, yet concludes with life and death—this refers to the gathering and dispersal of the single qi within humans. But can Heaven and Earth not be spoken of in terms of life and death?\"*\n\nI reply: *\"Heaven and Earth are their forms; life and death are their qi. Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to live. The yang soul belongs to Heaven; the yin corporeal soul belongs to Earth. In death, the soul’s qi returns to Heaven, while the body and corporeal soul descend to Earth, reverting to the Great Origin as before. Thus, by examining human life and death, one may encompass the day and night of Heaven and Earth. Within this are the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the transformations of the four seasons, the contraction and expansion of ghosts and spirits—who can fathom their bounds?\"*\n\nMaster Cheng said: *\"The* Book of Changes *speaks of ghosts and spirits as the workings of creation. Tracing spring to its origin, winter must follow; taking winter as the end, spring must return. Life and death are of the same kind. To know the Way of life is to know the Way of death; to know the Way of serving humans is to know the Way of serving spirits. Life and death, humans and ghosts—one yet two, two yet one.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Ghosts and spirits are inherently difficult to comprehend. One should focus on the essentials: how much principle governs human life! From the moment we receive the nature of the Five Constants, there are the bonds of father and child, the righteousness of ruler and minister. Each of these principles of life must be understood, and then the principles of death will also be known. In serving one’s ruler or parents, one fulfills what is proper. Having exhausted the Way of sincerity and reverence, one may then turn this mind to serving ghosts and spirits—thus, in sacrifice, the departed are present; in worship, the spirits are present. This requires grasping the principle without deficiency. At the time of death, when the principle of life is exhausted, one rests in death without regret.\"*\n\nThus, Master Zhang said: *\"Preserve what is right in life; in death, find peace.\"*\n\nThe Confucians hold that principle is neither born nor destroyed, while the Buddhists claim that consciousness is neither born nor destroyed. The sages do not speak of what comes after death—what more need be said? They only teach that between birth and death, one must attend to life with utmost care. The Six Classics record the deeds of the sages and worthies in full, yet say nothing of the threshold of life and death, for they regard it as an ordinary matter. Only the *Records* and the *Analects of Lu* provide detailed accounts of Master Zeng’s final illness, merely to instruct scholars in preserving the body and upholding principle. How could they emulate the Buddhists, who, ignorant of principle, regard sitting death or standing transcendence as marvels?\n\nHu Mingshong said: *\"Humans are creatures of life, yet the Buddha speaks only of death. Human affairs are visible, yet the Buddha speaks only of the hidden. Master Hengqu’s view that ‘when form dissolves, it returns to the Origin’ means that humans receive this qi to live, and in death, return to the Great Origin. Thus, when a person dies, their qi disperses. The qi within the Great Origin then emerges anew to give life to others.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Heaven and Earth are the substance; ghosts and spirits are their function. Heaven and Earth are spoken of in their entirety, while ghosts and spirits refer to their dynamic transformations, permeating above and below. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, and plants—all are understood by analogy. Spring and summer are spirit; autumn and winter are ghost. Day is spirit; night is ghost. Before noon is spirit; after noon is ghost. Inhalation is spirit; exhalation is ghost. Life is spirit; death is ghost. Speaking is spirit; silence is ghost. Extension is spirit; contraction is ghost. Qi coming forth is spirit; its return is ghost. The sun is spirit; the moon is ghost. After the third day is spirit; after the sixteenth day is ghost. Heaven’s creation is spirit; Earth’s transformation is ghost. Plants sprouting is spirit; withering is ghost. Human youth and vigor are spirit; decline and old age are ghost. Wind and thunder stirring are spirit; their gathering is ghost. The onset of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning is spirit; their cessation is ghost.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang said: *\"The Great Void cannot be without qi. Qi cannot but gather to form the myriad things, nor can the myriad things but disperse back into the Great Void. This cycle of exit and entry is inevitable. As qi, when dispersed, enters the formless, it perfectly attains our body; when gathered, it takes shape without losing its constancy. Gathered, it is our body; dispersed, it is still our body. Knowing that life and death do not perish—one may then speak of nature!\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Nature is simply principle and cannot be spoken of in terms of gathering and dispersal. What gathers to give life and disperses in death is merely qi. The so-called spirit, soul, consciousness, and awareness are all the workings of qi. Thus, when gathered, they exist; when dispersed, they vanish. But principle is never absent due to gathering or dispersal. Where there is principle, there is qi. If qi gathers here, principle also resides here—it cannot be compared to ice and foam. Ghosts and spirits are the spirit, soul, consciousness, and corporeal soul—qi, not nature. Thus, the rites of sacrifice operate through resonance by kind. If nature were involved, how could there be such resonance? Yet the qi that has already dispersed is gone without a trace. That which is rooted in principle and daily renewed remains vast and inexhaustible. Therefore, the sages’ sacrifices—setting up ancestral tablets, employing impersonators, offering mugwort and millet, libations and purifications—whether seeking in the yin or the yang, spare no effort, stopping only at the utmost. They say, ‘Perhaps they will partake.’ The profound sincerity, compassion, subtlety, and elusive intent therein defy expression—such things cannot be sought with the shallow knowledge and rigid views of the common world.\"*\n\nHow can it be said that upon receiving one’s formed body, this nature thereby becomes one’s own possession, enduring even after death without annihilation, standing alone as a distinct entity hidden in stillness, awaiting the sacrifices and prayers of others to be summoned forth and partake of offerings? If this were so, then the boundaries of its scope and the place of its abode would indeed be definable. Yet from the beginning of creation until now, the accumulated dead would have piled up without end, leaving no space to contain them. How could such a principle exist?\n\nMoreover, the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth resemble a great furnace. The ceaseless generation of beings knows no rest—this is the true principle of reality, unconcerned with annihilation. Now to fix one’s gaze upon a vast, empty stillness and instead regard the consciousness of the deceased as the true principle of reality—is this not a grave error?\n\nWhat the sages and worthies mean by \"returning to wholeness\" and \"resting in death\" is simply that one has not lost one’s proper place. Having received the principle from Heaven, one may die without shame. It is not that there exists some tangible entity to be preserved and returned, thereby ensuring that one’s indestructible and imperishable self may repose in tranquil solitude. Whether one dies young or lives long, one remains unwavering, cultivating the self and awaiting one’s end—this is a state of being without contrivance. It cannot be equated with the heterodox view that makes much of life and death, warning of impermanence’s swift approach, and thus misleads scholars.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Ghosts and spirits are but the workings of creation. Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—thus the positions of Qian and Kun are established. They are stirred by thunder and nourished by wind and rain.\" This explains that in the manifest there are rites and music, and in the hidden there are ghosts and spirits. Master Zhu said this refers to the contrast between the hidden and the manifest. To claim that the hidden contains ghosts and spirits while the manifest does not is to misconstrue the subject, failing to understand what ghosts and spirits truly are and becoming mired in doctrines of rebirth and karma.\n\nHow could one not see that within rites and music there are ghosts and spirits, and within ghosts and spirits there are rites and music? The two are one and the same; one must only distinguish their boundaries and differentiate them. Heaven and Earth take their positions, distinguished by the act of treading—this is ritual. Yet within the interaction of the two qi, there is never an absence of music. The stirring of wind and thunder is music. Yet when the wind subsides and the rain ceases, when thunder stills and lightning fades, each follows its proper order—within this, there is never an absence of ritual.\n\nRitual restrains human emotions, for qi contracts. Harmony is prized, and what contracts will again expand. Music stirs human emotions, for qi is spirit-like. Yet its movements and rests are measured, and what expands will again contract. The hidden and the manifest communicate; contraction and expansion alternate, and there is nowhere they do not commune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe Buddhists, however, regard death and killing as settled matters, claiming that the manifest becomes human and the hidden becomes ghost. How could they know that the noble person’s vigilance in solitude makes even the hidden corners of a room feel as though the divine is present? Ritual binds the sinews and body, while music nurtures the nature and emotions. The rites and music within oneself are the very presence of ghosts and spirits above.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Book of Changes* states: \"The essence of qi refers to the seventh and eighth hexagrams, speaking of the spirits of wood and fire that generate beings in the southeast. The wandering soul refers to the ninth and sixth hexagrams, speaking of the spirits of metal and water that end beings in the northwest.\" The old yin and old yang, when contracted, become ghosts. The young yin and young yang, when expanded, become spirits. The southeast is the manifest; the northwest is the hidden. This does not mean that ghosts and spirits exist only in the darkness of Heaven and Earth while the manifest is devoid of them.\n\nIn later ages, rites decayed and music was abandoned; human hearts became frivolous and deceitful. Having lost their order and harmony, their communion with ghosts and spirits no longer followed the proper way. If one does not revere them, they become distant—how could there be any principle of resonance and response?\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Ghosts and spirits are the innate capacities of the two qi.\" Master Zhu said: \"Master Cheng’s explanation of ghosts and spirits as the pathways of creation is fine, but it remains too vague. Master Zhang’s account is clearer, revealing the presence of yin and yang, contraction and expansion, and their ceaseless alternation.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, the terms \"yin\" and \"yang\" alone cannot fully express ghosts and spirits. The numinous aspect of yin is called ghost; the numinous aspect of yang is called spirit. Their innate capacity is precisely their numinosity, enabling them to contract, expand, and transform.\n\nMaster Zhang further said: \"At the beginning of a thing’s life, qi arrives daily and flourishes. Once the thing reaches full growth, qi daily returns and disperses. The arrival is called spirit, for it expands. The return is called ghost, for it withdraws.\" He also said: \"At the beginning of a person’s life, the qi of Heaven and Earth continually accumulates, gradually growing and expanding within the body. Upon reaching its peak, it gradually declines and dissipates. Yet all this occurs naturally, not by any external agency—hence it is called innate capacity.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Yin is the shadow of yang; ghosts are the shadow of humans; the moon is the shadow of the sun; emotions are the shadow of nature. Yang, humans, the sun, and nature are all the masters of yin, ghosts, the moon, and emotions. Once the master is established, the shadow naturally follows. At the winter solstice, the first yang is born, corresponding to the birth of the first yin at the summer solstice. From the winter solstice to the sixth month, the six yangs are complete; from the summer solstice to the twelfth month, the six yins are complete. One yang in the heavens corresponds to one yin on earth; one thing in the water corresponds to one thing on the shore—this is true of all things. Yet yang is always the master, and yin is always the shadow, like the male and female. A day has twelve hours, and a year has twelve months. At dawn, the moon begins to brighten; at the full moon, its light is complete. At the first and last quarters, it begins to wane, and by the end of the month, it is dark. From this, one may perceive the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nWithin nature lies the principle of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, and externally, it casts the shadow of compassion, shame, deference, and a sense of right and wrong. Every form that emerges casts a shadow. The human soul becomes spirit, and within it, the shadow of the spirit becomes the ghost’s corporeal soul.\"\n\nWhen the sun reaches its darkest point, the moon loses its light; when a person grows old, the spirit becomes weary and restless.\n\nIt is also said: Before thoughts and considerations arise, ghosts and spirits do not yet know them. If not by me, then by whom? The practice of the Dao should reach a point where even ghosts and spirits cannot perceive it. Good and evil take form in speech and manifest in action, at which point others begin to know them. Yet as soon as they sprout in the heart and emerge in thought, ghosts and spirits already know them. *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"The noble person is cautious and reverent in what is unseen, fearful in what is unheard.\" This is indeed the noble person’s discipline of vigilance in solitude, ensuring no shame even in the hidden corners of the house. Yet when it speaks of thoughts not yet arisen, it refers to the time before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are expressed—ghosts and spirits cannot glimpse that boundary. Thus it is said: If not by me, then by whom?\n\nIn the depths of obscurity and the subtlest of matters, though not yet manifest, the incipient movement has already stirred. Though known only to oneself and unseen by others, ghosts and spirits already know it. Therefore, the noble person is vigilant in solitude, not waiting for words or deeds to take shape. Ever mindful of ghosts and spirits hovering above, they dare not harbor even the slightest reckless thought within. Once, a man played the zither and saw a mantis hunting a cicada; those who heard it perceived a killing intent in the music. The killing intent was in the heart, yet others heard it in the zither—how much more so for ghosts and spirits? In this, the noble person cultivates only reverence to keep the inner self upright. They listen to the soundless, see the formless, and thus do not wait for signs in countenance or utterance before exerting effort.\n\nShao [Yong] also said: The spirit of the human heart is the spirit of Heaven and Earth. To deceive one’s own heart is to deceive Heaven itself. How can one not be vigilant? Heaven and Earth are empty and luminous, needing neither ears nor eyes to see and hear all.\n\nIt is further said: When qi and form flourish, the hun and po flourish; when qi and form decline, the hun and po also decline. The hun transforms with qi, while the po ascends with form. Thus, as long as form exists, the po remains; when form dissolves, the po scatters. When the qi of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, heart, spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys is whole, it is called a person. The numinous spirit of the heart is called *shen*; the numinous spirit of the gallbladder is called *po*; the numinous spirit of the spleen is called *hun*; the numinous essence of the kidneys is called *jing*. The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes as sight; the essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears as hearing; the hun of the spleen manifests in the nose as smell; the po of the gallbladder manifests in the mouth as speech. Only when these eight are complete is one called a person. This explains the inner workings of the human form, refining the hun and po to gain understanding.\n\nThe human body possesses the numinous principle of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits, yet fails to reflect inwardly. Instead, it spends its days chasing externals, reaching white-haired old age and death without self-awareness—how lamentable! Metal and wood mark the beginning and end of generation; in humans, they correspond to spirit, essence, hun, and po. Essence forms the body, and the yin po clings to it; qi forms the hun, and the yang shen depends on it. These four cannot be separated, which is why the hun and po wax and wane with qi and form. When form changes, the yang hun departs; when the po dissolves, the yin form decays. Thus, the ancient kings regarded dismemberment and incineration as the ultimate punishment, and for the dead, they divined burial sites to ensure peaceful rest.\n\nThe kidneys belong to the north, where Heaven’s One Water resides, hence they store essence. Essence first transforms into po, and the po is the source of essence—it is the servant of essence and qi, accompanying their ingress and egress. Water generates wood, and wood is its child, so the gallbladder stores po. The heart belongs to the south, where the Great Void’s fire governs clarity, storing shen. The yang hun is born of shen, and the hun is the attendant of shen and qi, following their ingress and egress. Fire generates earth, and earth is its child, so the spleen stores hun.\n\nIn the human body, spirit and essence are the masters, while hun and po are their agents. When essence flourishes, the po flourishes. Only utmost sincerity can generate essence, and utmost essence can generate spirit. Sincerity is what Heaven’s One produces without falsity. If one can focus on the One and not dissipate their essence, they attain sincerity like a spirit. The heart can govern qi but cannot master the One. If it dissipates essence, the heart becomes enslaved by form. How then is one different from beasts, not merely dying without a name?\n\nHuman life arises from spirit, essence, hun, and po—the functions of nature—and from blood, qi, water, and grain—the functions of form. Only through mutual nourishment of inner and outer can spirit and essence grow strong, and hun and po flourish. Nature is received from Heaven and must have a repository. The heart stores shen, the kidneys store essence, the spleen stores hun, and the gallbladder stores po. The heart governs these repositories. Thus, when it manifests in voice, scent, speech, and sight without violating principle, it is called numinous. Form is endowed by Earth and must have a storehouse. The lungs are the storehouse for transmitting qi; the liver is the storehouse for transmitting blood; the stomach is the storehouse for transforming water and grain, while the intestines and bladder separate the clear and turbid. Thus it is said: \"Of the natures endowed by Heaven and Earth, humans are the most noble\"—how could it be like the heterodox teachings on hun and po?\n\nOnce, a student of immortality told me: \"Begin with the dragon, tiger, quail, and tortoise.\" He also said: \"Begin with the heart and kidneys.\" And again: \"Seek within the Five Agents of the Five Viscera,\" yet he never revealed the ultimate secret. Later, I obtained the essential method, and the starting point was quite simple. It is simply a matter of focused effort—yet today, people know but do not practice.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] and Cai Xishan explored this their whole lives and deeply understood it. They once said: Daoists favor shortcuts, using terms like lead, mercury, and the Mysterious Female, exchanging names to confound people. In truth, it is merely essence and qi. Qu Yuan’s *Chu Ci* contains the theory of \"illuminating the po.\"\n\nSpeaking in terms of essence and spirit, \"illuminating\" (荧) means \"to nourish\" (营), the gathering of yin numinosity that manifests as luminosity. If the *po* does not receive the *hun*, then the *hun* cannot bear the *po*, and the person dies. Moreover, the *hun* is active while the *po* is tranquil; the *hun* is fire and two, while the *po* is water and one. To \"bear and nourish the *po*\" is to apply the *hun* to the *po*, to use movement to guard stillness, to use fire to press upon water, and to use two to guard one. It is like a person mounting a chariot and being carried upon it—then the *hun* is at peace and the *po* is clear and bright. Fire does not scorch, and water does not overflow; this is the essential method for long life and enduring vision. Yet this still does not explain the *how* of it.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] has a poem that says:\n*\"Thieves unlock the secret of life’s mystery,\nStealing past the gate of birth and death.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Yet fear defying Heaven’s Way,\nCan stolen life ever be at peace?\"*\nThus, he too knew but did not practice.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Essence* and *qi* are terms used in relation to things; *hun* and *po* are terms used in relation to humans; *ghosts* and *spirits* are terms used when speaking of them apart from humans. While alive, they are called *essence* and *qi*; after death, they are called *hun* and *po*; in things, they are called *ghosts* and *spirits*. *Qi* is substantial; *hun* and *po* are half-substantial, half-insubstantial; *ghosts* and *spirits* are mostly insubstantial with only a little substance.\n\nHe also said: When the two—essence and *qi*—unite, *hun* and *po* gather to form a person. When the wandering *hun* departs alone, the yang has already dispersed, and the yin has nowhere to return, thus becoming transformation. Zichan said: \"At the beginning of human life, the first transformation is called *po*; once the *po* is born, the yang is called *hun*.\" The Tang scholar Kong said: \"When a person is born, the first transformation is into form. The numinosity of form is called *po*. Within the *po* there is naturally yang *qi*. The spirit of *qi* is called *ling*—these are the names for *hun*, *po*, spirit, and numinosity. At birth, the movement of ears, eyes, heart, perception, hands, and feet is the numinosity of the *po*. As essence and spirit, nature and perception gradually develop awareness, this is the spirit of *qi*.\"\n\nMoreover, the *hun* is yang and belongs to fire; the *po* is yin and belongs to water. \"Heavenly One generates water\"—yin and yang first interact. Once the *po* is born, warmth gives rise to the *hun*; the *po* comes first, then the *hun*. The *hun* is always the master, the trunk. *The Huainanzi* says: \"Heavenly *qi* is the *hun*, the yang spirit; earthly *qi* is the *po*, the yin spirit.\" Yue Qi said: \"The clarity and sharpness of the heart are called *hun* and *po*.\" The *po* belongs to the physical form; the *hun* belongs to the spirit. *Essence* is again the *po*; the *po* is the spirit of essence. *Spirit* is again the *hun*; the *hun* is the spirit of *qi*.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *hun* is spirit-like and the *po* is numinous; the *hun* is yang and the *po* is yin; the *hun* is active and the *po* is tranquil. While alive, the *hun* is borne by the *po*, and the *po* restrains the *hun*. After death, the *hun* scatters and returns to Heaven, while the *po* sinks and returns to Earth. That which moves and acts is the *hun*; that which does not move or act is the *po*. When the *po* is strong, the ears and eyes are keen, and memory is sharp. When the elderly grow dim-sighted, hard of hearing, and forgetful, it is because the *po* has weakened.\n\nIf the *hun* is fiery and the *po* is cool, and one can use the *hun* to guard the *po*, then the *hun* has something to guard and becomes tranquil, while the *po* is warmed by the *hun* and gains vitality. The heat of the *hun* generates coolness; the coolness of the *po* generates warmth. Only when the two do not separate can yang not scorch and yin not stagnate, achieving harmony. Otherwise, the more the *hun* moves, the more the *po* becomes still; the hotter the *hun*, the cooler the *po*. When the two fail to harmonize, death follows.\n\nHe also said: While a person lives, *hun* and *po* interact; after death, they separate. The *po* has a form within, like a crystal’s ancestor, and thus manifests as the clarity of ears and eyes. The dark halo of the moon is the *po*; its light is the *hun*. It is like incense: the sap that exudes when burned is the *po*; the fragrant smoke that rises afterward is the *hun*. The *hun* is the flame of the *po*; the *po* is the root of the *hun*. Fire is the *hun*; the mirror is the *po*. A lamp has flame—when an object approaches, it burns. A mirror reflects, yet remains within. Fire and the sun are external manifestations; metal and water are internal manifestations. Fire and the sun are the *hun*; metal and water are the *po*. The light of a person’s eyes is the *po*; the ears are likewise. Why is it the *po*? Because the ability to hear is the *po*. The nose knows scents; the tongue knows tastes—all are the same. Yet one cannot take the ability to recognize words as the *po*, for recognition belongs to the heart. Whether sweet, salty, or sour, it must pass through the tongue.\n\nYin governs storage and reception, so the *po* can remember. Yang governs movement within, so the *hun* can manifest outwardly. These two are never truly separate. When essence gathers, the *po* gathers; when *qi* gathers, the *hun* gathers—this is the basis of human and other beings. When essence is exhausted and the *po* descends, *qi* scatters and the *hun* wanders, and there is no more awareness.\n\nSpeaking of the human body, though *qi* belongs to yang, the physical form of the *po* already belongs to yin—within life is already the principle of death. Though transformation belongs to yang, the *hun* ascends while the physical form of the *po* descends, thus possessing yin and yang. Even now, the living are half spirit and half ghost. Before death, spirit is master; after death, ghost is master.\n\nIn the *Liyun*, Zai Wo said: \"I have heard the names *ghosts* and *spirits*, but do not know what they mean.\" The Master said: \"*Qi* is the fullness of spirit; *po* is the fullness of ghost. The teaching on ghosts and spirits is the utmost.\" The *Jiaotesheng* says: \"The *hun*-*qi* returns to Heaven because the *hun* originally attaches to *qi*; when a person dies, *qi* must rise.\" It also says: \"The physical *po* descends to Earth because the *po* originally belongs to form; when a person dies, form returns to the soil.\"\n\nThe sages, in managing the affairs of the living and the dead, established sacrificial rites. Since existence and nonexistence differ, they created distinct names. They changed the name of the living spirit to *hun* and the name of the living ghost to *po*, combining *hun* and *po* to name them *ghosts and spirits*, honoring them in ritual. Thus it is said: \"Illuminating the Mandate of ghosts and spirits to instruct the common people.\"\n\nThen the myriad masses stand in awe, and the ten thousand people submit in reverence.\n\nYanling Jizi, mourning his son, said: \"Flesh and bone return to the earth—such is fate. But as for the *hun*, there is nowhere it does not go.\" The *Erya*’s *Shiwen* states: \"The word *ghost* means *return*, for flesh and bone are hidden away in the earth. Its *qi*, however, rises and soars above—this is what we call the unfathomable, the *spirit*.\" In truth, the root of ghosts and spirits lies in *hun* and *po*.\n\nThe fullness of *spirit* refers to the functions of breathing through mouth and nose, awareness, and movement. The fullness of *ghost* refers to the clarity of ears and eyes, the ability to see and hear, and the vigor of essence and blood.\n\nSomeone asked about the theory of life and death. Master Xie said: \"It is the exhaustion of *qi*.\" The questioner asked: \"Are there ghosts and spirits?\" He replied: \"I once asked Master Mingdao: 'If I tell you there are none, how will you believe it? But if I tell you there are, you must go and seek them out.' That is the answer.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Master Shangcai’s explanation of ghosts and spirits is excellent. He said: 'What is fitting draws people to emulate it, not to die for it. What is fitting—such as offering sacrifices to ancestors and parents—requires utmost sincerity to move and reach them. One must not treat it as a matter of life and death. What is unfitting makes people distance themselves; one must not treat it as a living concern, nor ignore it entirely, lest it vanish.'\"\n\nWhen asked about the purpose of sacrificial offerings, he said: \"It is their intention—fasting for three days, abstaining for five, seeking in the realms of yin and yang, the four directions, and above and below. The aim is to gather one’s own spirit, thereby reaching the ancestral temple and summoning the spirits.\" Yet though this is so, to insist on their existence is wrong, and to deny it is equally wrong. Within this lies a subtle principle, in the realm of \"as if present, as if absent.\" Only by resolving this can one proceed correctly. He said: \"It is not a matter of confusion—if you will it to be, it is; if you will it not to be, it is not. Only then do you grasp that ghosts and spirits, though unseen in the void, manifest everywhere, for they are the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nHe also said: \"When yin and yang unite, they become *spirit*; when form and *qi* part, there are *ghosts*. To know this is wisdom; to serve them is benevolence. Fasting and abstinence are merely means to gather one’s own spirit. The ancients used a *shi* (representative) to invite the union of yin and yang, drawing their *qi* to that person—this was not done in vain. When sacrificial sincerity and reverence are complete, *qi* naturally gathers. Thus, in ancient sacrifices, the spirits were summoned and came.\"\n\nWhen asked, \"If ancestors are already dead, how do they come?\" he replied: \"As Master Shangcai said: 'The spirit of ancestors is the same as our own spirit.' The response in sacrifice may be sought in yin or in yang, each according to its kind. Seek, and all will come. It is not that some entity lingers in the void, awaiting the arrival of descendants. Rather, the presiding sacrificer, being of the same *qi* in continuous flow, already harbors that *qi*. By exhausting sincerity and reverence, one moves and reaches them.\"\n\nSomeone asked about distant and collateral relatives. He said: \"They all flow from the same source, originally without interruption. Though a person dies and *hun* and *po* scatter—*po* being more settled—one must summon the *hun* to return, so that it may reunite with the *po*. The sages taught descendants to perform regular sacrifices to gather the *qi* of their ancestors. Though it may seem scattered in the moment, its root remains here. When sincerity and reverence are complete, that *qi* is drawn and gathered here. The descendant’s body is here, so the ancestor’s *qi* is here as well. There is a bloodline that runs through, which is why spirits do not respond to those outside their kind, and people do not sacrifice to those outside their clan—because their *qi* is not connected.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The contraction and expansion, coming and going of ghosts and spirits are merely *qi*. Human *qi* constantly interacts with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, though people do not perceive it. When the human heart stirs, it reaches the *qi*, which then resonates with this contraction and expansion. As the earlier scholars said: 'Where there is principle, there is the *qi* of yin and yang.' This *qi* permeates even the finest hair or thread. When this heart stirs, that *qi* responds. Where the numinous light of ghosts and spirits shines, it is radiant; where their *qi* rises, it is like steam; where it stirs one’s spirit, the wind is solemn and mournful. Thus, the *Sacrificial Rites* speak of seeking in yang to repay *qi*—*qi* is *spirit*. Hence, the establishment of ancestral temples, the burning of offerings at the grave, the lighting of torches, and the use of fragrant herbs to make the *qi* ascend—all belong to the yang category. There is also seeking in yin to repay the *po*—*po* is *ghost*. Thus, offerings of millet, sacrificial meats, liver, lungs, heads, and hearts, along with *yu* and *kuai* (sacrificial wines), are poured onto the earth to seek them. The smoke rising from split wood is the *qi* of moisture—this is *po*. Uniting *hun* and *po* as one is how one seeks the *qi* of ghosts and spirits in sacrifice.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion: Breathing is the *qi* of our body; clouds and rain are the *qi* of mountains and rivers. Rising above is the *qi* of numinous light and brightness. When it moves here, it responds there. From the first generation of humanity, the ancestors of *qi*-transformation, it has been passed down to this day. Descendants, ancestors, Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—all are connected by a single *qi*. The earlier scholars said: \"Though the *hun*-*qi* of the dead scatters, setting up a spirit tablet to preside over it requires gathering some of that *qi* here.\" In ancient times, from the moment of death, they would summon the *hun*, restore the *po*, and establish multiple spirit tablets—always seeking to maintain a connection to that spirit. The ancients used the blood of sacrificial animals to anoint tortoise shells, for when the shell lost its numinosity, they would use this living *qi* to reconnect it.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"The great mountains and rivers that bring forth clouds and rain do so simply because *qi* steams upward.\"\n\nQi is spirit. People today do not understand this principle; at the first sign of flood or drought, they rush to temples to pray, unaware of where rain and dew originate. The great mountains and rivers can summon clouds and bring rain—why not inquire of them? How can one seek this from wooden or clay effigies?\n\nSomeone asked Master Zhu: \"When people pray to Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, is it that my *qi* moves and their *qi* responds? When descendants sacrifice to ancestors, is it that my *qi* moves and their *qi* responds?\" Without the numinous *qi* of spirits, it constantly expands and contracts without cease. The *qi* of humans and ghosts, however, dissipates without remainder—though the speed of dissipation varies. Yet if one’s own *qi* connects with theirs, then through utmost sincerity and reverence, as Master Shangcai said, \"Where there is intent, there is presence.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"By its functional operation, it is called *gui*; by its wondrous operation, it is called *shen*.\" He also said: \"Ghosts and spirits lie at the edge of creation and transformation.\" The heat of the sun and cold of the moon, the brightness of day and darkness of night, the growth of spring and the withering of autumn, the flourishing of summer and the storage of winter—all that generates and completes the myriad things are the functional operations of ghosts and spirits, manifest and visible. He further said: \"The wondrous operation that cannot be seen—perceiving without form, hearing without sound, embodying things yet leaving no trace. The Dao is neither existent nor nonexistent; it is both present and absent. Suddenly, in an instant, it transforms and changes. In the emptiness of space, there is thunder and wind, rain and lightning. On the branches of trees, flowers and leaves suddenly bloom, wither, or open. These are the impartial and upright ghosts and spirits of Heaven and Earth, phenomena people commonly witness without finding strange.\"\n\nYet when ghostly fires appear at night, bricks fly in broad daylight, beams strike chests, or whispers cling to ears—with a thousand monstrous forms too numerous to record—these are what the *Great Change* calls \"a cartload of ghosts.\" The *Spring and Autumn Annals* speaks of stones speaking in Jin, of bronze tripods casting omens, of a hundred anomalies subdued by Han swords, and spirits howling when tested. The ghostly fan of Minister Fan, the serpentine form of Kong Daofu—should these be believed or not?\n\nIt is said: These are all born of the chaotic intermingling of a single *qi*, tainted by the dark and perverse, and thus deemed strange. They are not the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth. For ghosts and spirits arise from yin and yang just as humans arise in the world. As there are many kinds of people, so too are there many kinds of things, and many kinds of ghosts and spirits. Throughout Heaven and Earth, they densely intermingle, assuming forms according to their natures, each fully endowed—one cannot say they do not exist.\n\nThose born of Heaven become the sun, moon, and stars, yet may transform into comets, eclipses, or hail. Those born of Earth become mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, yet may take the forms of mountain spirits, sea deities, *chimei*, or *wangliang*. Those born of water, fire, earth, or stone may bring cataclysmic floods, raging wildfires, dust storms, or collapsing cliffs. As for humans, the upright become sages, worthies, and noble gentlemen; the aberrant become fools, the dull, the stupid, the violent, and the tyrannical. In greater extremes, if one does not observe the turbid Yellow River or the clear Wei, they become the chaotic monstrosities of the cosmos. In death, some become wise and upright spirits, receiving sacrifices for a hundred generations; others, harboring grievances and suffering, coalesce into ox ghosts and serpent deities. Their transformations are beyond enumeration—can one truly say they do not exist? It is merely a matter of whether they are upright or not.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Winter’s cold and summer’s heat are the norm of principle. Yet if summer grows cold or winter hot, can one say this principle does not exist?\" This is why the sages spoke of constancy and did not discuss the strange.\n\nMaster Cheng further said: \"The case of Boyou becoming a *li* is a different principle.\" Master Zhu said: \"It is not the common principle of life and death.\" He also said: \"When one’s *qi* is not exhausted but death is forced upon them, they naturally become a *li*.\" Zichan established an heir for him, giving him a place to return. These words exhaust principle to its utmost precision—one may say he truly understood the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nIn the *Zuozhuan*, when the people of Zheng were startled, saying, \"Boyou has arrived!\" they all fled, not knowing where to go. Some dreamed of Boyou in armor, saying, \"I will kill Dai, and then kill Duan.\" The people grew even more fearful. Zichan established Gongsun Xie to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.\n\nThe Master said: \"When ghosts and spirits have a place to return, they do not become *li*. I provided him a place to return.\"\n\nJin’s Zhao Jing asked: \"Does Boyou still become a ghost?\" The Master replied: \"When one consumes abundant essence from things, their *hun* and *po* grow strong, and thus their spirit may attain the clarity of divine illumination. Even common men and women who die violently—if their *hun* and *po* still cling to others—they become malevolent *li*. How much more so for Liangxiao, a descendant of our former lord Duke Mu, whose use of things was vast, whose absorption of essence was great, and whose clan was large and well-supported? That he died violently and became a ghost is only fitting.\"\n\nTang’s Master Kong said: \"He held high office, wielded power, and enjoyed lavish sustenance, so his use of things was abundant and his *hun* and *po* strong.\" Someone asked: \"Former scholars spoke of ghosts and spirits as both existent and nonexistent. Yet what the *Zuozhuan* records cannot be called nonexistent.\" Master Zhu said: \"Humans receive the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, which must eventually disperse—only the timing varies. Where their spirit reaches, it moves Heaven above. In ancient times, Jing Ke admired Yan Dan’s righteousness, and a white rainbow pierced the sun. Wei Xiansheng devised the Changping strategy for Qin, and Venus devoured the Pleiades. When Han executed the filial widow, there was a great drought for three years. When Jin killed an innocent commander, blood flowed backward up the pillars. Other examples, such as Duke Jing of Qi dreaming of the ghost of Wuqiu or the Wang clan of Han exonerating the injustice at Xueque Pavilion, are all recorded by historians and cannot be dismissed. I shall categorize these accounts so that later discussions of ghosts and spirits do not lose their bearings and drift without guidance. This is also the meaning of ‘revering and keeping them at a distance.’\"\n\nThe explanation is as follows: The two *qi* of yin and yang disperse between the two realms. Everywhere the eye falls, ghosts and spirits are present. If we do not distinguish them by their domains, all becomes one indistinguishable mass, the realms of the hidden and the manifest grow confused, and the human Way cannot be established. Thus, in Heaven, they are the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, frost, dew, the four seasons, and cold and heat—clearly, ghosts and spirits move within them. This is what the *Book of Documents* calls \"serving the Six Ancestors,\" and should be regarded as one category. On Earth, they are the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the mountain lords and river sovereigns who summon clouds and rain to aid the work of transformation—these cannot be called nonexistent. This is what the *Military Triumph* refers to as \"passing through famous mountains and great rivers,\" and should be regarded as another category. Those whose merit and virtue remain among the people and are recorded in the sacrificial canon—such as Gou Long and Hou Ji for their achievements, or the Master for his virtue, who as sages and worthies endure through ten thousand generations without fading—should be regarded as yet another category. When a person dies, they are called a ghost, their *qi* already dispersed. Yet where the descendants’ spirit gathers, the ancestors come to partake. This is what the *Analects of Lu* means by: \"Sacrifice as if they are present; sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits are present.\" This is not only true for the scholar sacrificing to his ancestors. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all have their proper ranks and measures, which must not be transgressed—this should be regarded as another category. Below this, there are mountain goblins, earth spirits, water monsters, and tree demons; where there is no ghost, there is still debate, and strange phenomena arise. The turnip was punished for falsehood, yet it appeared in person—these cannot be disbelieved. Some hang from the tip of a writing brush or cling to a winnowing basket; some generate thunder or summon cranes. Between Heaven and Earth, such wandering *hun* and stray ghosts exist, capable of deluding people. They cannot be called nonexistent, but they are not of the proper kind—this should be regarded as another category.\n\nWhen categories are precisely distinguished, principles become perfectly clear. As Gu Yong said: \"Understand the nature of Heaven and Earth, and you will not be deluded by the supernatural.\" The ancients said: \"Govern the world with the Dao, and its ghosts will not be divine.\" This is the Way of cultivating the self. The human body is the meeting place of ghosts and spirits. Within this mere shell, inside and out, there is nothing that is not the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. When this heart stirs, it responds. Thus it is said: \"What fills Heaven and Earth constitutes my body; what leads Heaven and Earth constitutes my nature.\" When my heart is upright, those impartial and upright ghosts and spirits naturally respond. If there is any impropriety, those wandering *hun* and perverse *qi* will entangle and cannot be resolved.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"It is like a fish in water: the water outside is the same as the water inside its belly. The water in a mandarin fish’s belly is the same as the water in a carp’s belly.\" Though this saying is small, it can illustrate great truths. Since later ages, the theories of licentious and excessive sacrifices have arisen, and the virtue of the heart’s ghosts and spirits has been neglected. Alas, how lamentable!\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Seventeen, concludes.\n\n**Textual Notes and Emendations:**\n1. \"匝\" originally written as \"雨,\" amended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n2. \"大\" originally written as \"天,\" and \"去\" originally written as \"法,\" both amended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n3.

In ancient times, those who became scholars achieved success in three years and underwent one transformation in ten. They began as scholars and ended as sages. All people transform their qi-endowed nature to return to the Heaven-ordained nature. It is also said: \"Reverence alone suffices.\" Reverence leads to unity, unity to sincerity, sincerity to manifestation, manifestation to clarity, clarity to movement, movement to change, and change to transformation. Only the utmost sincerity in the world can bring about transformation.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why is *Transformation* placed at the end of the twenty-fifth scroll?\" The answer: Since the Supreme Ultimate first divided, Heaven and Earth have been like a great furnace, with the myriad beings born within it. From non-being to being, all emerge through refinement from within. From being to non-being, all gradually dissolve and return within. From the sixty-four thousand eight hundred years of the precelestial era’s inception to the postcelestial era from Yu’s *jiazi* to the *jiawu* year of the Yuan dynasty—over three thousand five hundred and ten years—how many transformations and changes have occurred among people? How many sages and worthies have appeared across the ages? Mountains and valleys shift, the cosmos renews, and not a single person or thing remains constant. Only through the preservation of classical texts can these be examined and verified.\n\nCold transforms into warmth, warmth into heat, heat into coolness, and coolness back into cold—within these transformations lies further change. Thus, spring transforms into summer, summer into autumn, and autumn into winter. The alternation of cold and heat continues without end. People and things are likewise bound within the transformations of Heaven and Earth and cannot escape them. Rotten pillars give rise to sesame and *fuling*; fish transform into dragons, the hidden taking flight. Sparrows transform into clams, the flying descending. Hawks transform into turtledoves, the vicious becoming virtuous. Turtledoves transform into hawks, the virtuous turning vicious. Wildcats transform into leopards, leopards into tigers—small things can indeed transform into great ones. Yet when a sage neglects reflection and acts recklessly, even greatness may diminish—how lamentable! Judging by yin and yang, nothing is immutable; how much more so for humans, who are the most spiritually endowed of all beings?\n\nThe blind man’s son can become a Yao; the man from the roadside can become a Yu; the seemingly foolish man from the humble alley can become a sage—these are those adept at transformation. Those who fail to transform well include Dan Zhu and Shang Jun, who were unworthy of their fathers; Xia Gui and Shang Xin, who bore no resemblance to their ancestors; Xia Hui, whose virtuous younger brother could not transform his elder brother; and Huan Chi and Sima Niu, whose elder brothers refused to emulate their younger siblings. Humans, as the most spiritually endowed of Heaven and Earth’s creations, yet fail to refine their qi-endowed nature to return to goodness, thereby betraying the transformative power of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow, then, can one excel at transformation? Only by cultivating utmost reverence to attain the realm of sincerity can one stand without shame as a human and align with Heaven and Earth. Scholars aspire to worthiness, the worthy to sageliness, and sages to Heaven. Without reverence, how can this be achieved? This chapter on *Transformation* concludes the scrolls for this reason.\n\nMaster Cheng Shuzhi said: \"*The Book of Changes* is about change, adapting to the times to follow the Dao.\" Master Zhu said: \"Change is the gradual process of transformation; transformation is the completion of change.\" He also said: \"Yin changes into yang, and yang transforms into yin.\" When change and transformation are discussed in contrast, change is growth, and transformation is decline. Yet when considered as a whole, all is transformation. At the turning point, it becomes change. Change is the shift from yin to yang, from non-being to being, from the subtle to the manifest, from night to day. The soft changes into the hard, and cold into warmth. From sprouts growing into branches and leaves, suddenly flourishing and taking on new forms—this is change. Transformation is the shift from yang to yin, from being to non-being, from flourishing to decline, from day to night. The hard transforms into the soft, and warmth into cold. Whatever has form and substance gradually diminishes until it vanishes—this is transformation.\n\nHe further said: \"Yin changing into yang is progress, naturally growing vigorously. Yang transforming into yin is retreat, naturally fading away without a trace. Yang, having reached its peak, turns back and retreats. Yin, having retreated to its limit, rises and advances. Thus, transformation is the image of advance and retreat. Yang transforming into yin and yin changing into yang—this is transformation. What enables transformation is the Dao. The Dao is the inherent mystery; transformation is the mechanism it rides. Thus, yin changes and yang transforms, and the Dao is present in all. It is present in both, hence unfathomable. As it is said: 'One who knows the Dao of transformation knows the workings of the spirit.' Therefore, the spirit has no fixed direction, and *The Book of Changes* has no fixed form. The spirit has no fixed direction—it may reside in yin or yang. Just as it is spring, it may already be summer; just as it is autumn, it may already be winter. *The Book of Changes* has no fixed form—it may be yin or yang. Just as it is spring, it may also be summer; just as it is autumn, it may also be winter. They alternate and interchange, unbound by any fixed form.\"\n\nMaster Yichuan said: \"Change is like a thing in the process of changing but not yet transformed; once transformed, there is no trace of the old.\" *The Essential Principles of Mount He* states: \"Returning to the original form is called transformation. Gradual alteration is called change. Even if the old form suddenly changes, it is still called transformation.\" This is the ancient view. Master Zhu’s explanation is more precise. He said: \"In transformation,裁 (cutting) is preserved in change.\" *Cai* means to cut or sever. He also said: \"To extend and enact it is preserved in *tong* (permeation).\"\n\n\"Permeation (*tong*) is the permeation of change. Having already determined through *cai* (cutting), one extends and enacts it. For example, a year is cut into four seasons, a season into three months, a day into twelve hours—this is change. Yin and yang alternate; without *cai* (cutting), how could there be fixed forms? Endless coming and going is called *tong* (permeation). To handle change appropriately is *tong*. When there is *tong*, there is no exhaustion.\n\nTransformation (*hua*) arises naturally, *cai* is human intervention, and change (*bian*) alters things. Transformation is a gradual, day-by-day process. For instance, the weather gradually cools, and upon reaching the Beginning of Autumn, it is decisively cut off—what follows is autumn, which is change. The twelve hours from *zi* to *chou* to *yin* and *mao* all transform imperceptibly, but after *hai*, the *zi* hour is sharply demarcated as belonging to the next day—this is what is meant by change. Again, like the movement of stars, which never pause for even a moment: if one were to record their positions hour by hour or from dusk to dawn, the daily discrepancy of one degree would make it impossible to track. Thus, the Dipper is only demarcated month by month. Whether it is the *hun* (dusk) or *dan* (dawn) culmination of a given day, it is determined by this monthly *cai*. When transformation reaches the end of a month, that is change.\n\nAnother example: a year of three hundred and sixty days progresses day by day, and when it reaches completion, this is transformation. From spring to summer, summer to autumn, autumn to winter—when the sage cuts this progression into four seasons, this is change.\n\nIt is said: 'Permeate its changes, so the people do not grow weary.' One must find someone who can permeate change. If left to transform on its own, how could it be managed? As in 'The dragon soars too high and meets with regret'—this is a failure of *tong*. To handle it without regret is *tong*. To permeate change is simply to ensure constant, unobstructed flow.\n\nFor example, a person’s circumstances—wealth or poverty, peace or peril, barbarism or hardship—these are changes. To act rightly in wealth, rightly in poverty, rightly in barbarism or hardship, so that there is no situation in which one does not find contentment—this is *tong*. To cut at the point of transformation is change; to handle it well is *tong*.\n\nThe changes of all things in the world arise solely from the two forces of yin and yang. When yin reaches its limit, it turns to yang; when yang reaches its limit, it turns to yin—one can only follow them. When the sage reaches the utmost point of goodness, there is still another principle at work. Before the stage of 'treading on frost, solid ice will come,' as soon as yin begins to stir within yang, one employs a hundred methods to restrain it—this is indeed so. But if yang were to persist unchecked, how could the myriad things come to fruition? It is simply the natural course of things. The rise and fall of a state’s fortune also follows this urgency.\n\nWhen Yao had reigned for seventy years, his vigor naturally declined, so he sought out Shun and entrusted the realm to him, thus renewing the cycle. If he had continued without pause until his death, even the legacies of Wen and Wu would have declined. The urgency of the Cheng and Kang eras gave way to complacency in maintaining prosperity, and when it reached its limit, King Zhao’s reign could not be revived. After Emperor Xuan of Han, the dynasty steadily declined until Guangwu arose—yet after one or two generations, it could not be sustained, and the imperial line repeatedly faltered. Emperor Guangwu of Liu was like what Kangjie called 'spring in autumn'—a matter of timing.\n\nIt is also said: When observing people within the workings of heaven’s mandate, there is not a moment of rest. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—there is no pause. It is like a great cartwheel, hurtling forward in decline. The sage simply follows its course, observing how the principle operates, applying this principle here and that principle there.\n\nThe six lines of *Qian* are all yang, each taking its image in sequence. They describe the sage’s dwelling in different positions and stages. Whether hidden, emerging, cautious, leaping, soaring, or at its peak, each is appropriate to its place. 'Hidden' means remaining below, not yet in use—like level ground where even if there is water, it is but a shallow pool, while the deep abyss cannot be fathomed. 'Leaping' means moving without yet taking flight—still grounded, but no longer walking. With a single bound, it rises, feet leaving the earth. Once it leaps, it ascends to the heavens, no longer bound to the abyss, yet still unfathomable. Below, it departs from walking; above, it nears flight. Neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor among men—unlike the second nine, which is secure. Here, one cannot advance or retreat; it is not up to oneself, but subject to the timing of heaven.\n\nIn the sage’s terms, this is like Shun’s trials, King Wen’s two-thirds dominion, or Tang and Wu’s victories at Mingtiao and Muye. At the top nine, it is the position of Yi and Zhou, yet it is already difficult. It seems that people within heaven’s mandate have not a moment’s respite. One may leap into action, possessing virtue but no position. If the effort is incomplete, one does not lose the status of a hidden dragon. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—there is not a moment’s pause. Like the wheel of a great cart, hurtling forward in urgency, the sage simply follows its course. As it is said: 'Preceding heaven, heaven does not oppose it; following heaven, it accords with the timing'—how could there be the slightest trace of self-interest?\n\nIt is also said: *Qian* is the utmost vigor under heaven. Nowadays, people only judge its vigor by whether it appears vigorous, not waiting for events to unfold before seeing it. Master Zhu said: I once noted that when Liu Yuancheng met others, he would sit for a long time without much conversation. Though urged to stay, he would not engage in discussion. When asked about this, Yuancheng said: 'A person who sits for a long time without shifting is surely noble.' Thus, observing how a person sits can reveal their nobility, longevity, or short lifespan. Later, when he met Master Caotang, he remarked that Yuancheng loved to talk.\"\n\nIn Nanjing, a crossroads of the four directions, scholars and officials from the southeast who passed through would invariably seek him out. His residence teemed with guests, and he would speak freely and extensively, without the slightest restraint. He passed away in the second year of the Xuanhe era, at the age of seventy-eight—only three or four years before the Jingkang disaster. Yuancheng died in the same period as Chen Liaoweng; one wonders, had the two masters lived through the Jingkang era, how would they have been employed?\n\nI say: In the early Shaoxing era, Ma Yongqing of Weiyang composed a *yulu*, recording that he had personally seen Yuancheng at around sixty-three or sixty-four, his bearing majestic and his spirit robust, his speech grand and his manner forthright. Whether in cold or heat, dawn or dusk, he would always meet guests in full attire. Even while engaged in conversation, his body remained upright, shoulders squared and back straight, his posture unmoving—even his hands and feet never shifted. A truly formidable man. Ma noted that when he recorded these words, twenty-six years had already passed. Thus, in the fifth year of Shaoxing, only fifteen years had elapsed since Yuancheng’s death.\n\nYuancheng initially studied under Master Sima Wengong, never uttering a single careless word. Once he grasped this principle, he upheld it steadfastly throughout his life. His virtue was perfected, his conduct revered, and all within the realm looked up to him. After crossing the ridge, he abstained from wine and desire, enduring harsh climates and poor water and soil without falling ill. His vitality and longevity were beyond that of ordinary men.\n\nMaster Shao’s *Xiantian Fangtu* and *Yuantu* depict the four images intersecting to form sixteen configurations. The eight trigrams interact to produce sixty-four, and from this wondrous interplay of resonance, all beings and things arise.\n\nWhen the qi of heaven and earth commingle, they give birth to beings and things. Observing their convergence reveals the extent of qi’s reach, from which one may discern the origin of their kind. When heavenly qi descends to earth, in humans it produces males, and in creatures, males. When earthly qi ascends to heaven, in humans it produces females, and in creatures, females. From the union of male and female, yang and yin, arise endless generations of transforming beings.\n\nOnce beings and things are born, their qi follows the ascending and descending, the interplay of heaven and earth’s qi. Humans receive the central qi of heaven and earth, and thus respond to the qi of all four directions. Creatures receive the partial qi of heaven and earth, each responding to what they encounter. Therefore, by observing the convergence of heaven and earth’s qi, one may understand the origins of beings and things. By observing the resonance of heaven and earth’s qi, one may understand their mutual generation.\n\nHeaven and earth are forms; their convergence is through *Qian* and *Kun*. When *Qian* and *Kun* are not in use, their convergence is through *Kan* and *Li*. Who but one who understands the Dao could recognize this?\n\nThe qi of a single day spans twelve hours; the qi of a month, thirty days; the qi of a year, twelve months. Wherever qi reaches, all things receive it according to their endowment, and by this endowment, they receive the qi of heaven and earth, becoming the root of endless generation.\n\nHumans receive the central qi of heaven and earth, thus moving in harmony with them, gathering the qi of all things within their bodies. This is why humans are nobler than heaven and earth and more spiritually endowed than all creatures. One who can grasp the Dao of heaven and earth and wield its mechanism is, in effect, heaven and earth themselves.\n\nIt is also said: Those who receive the central qi of heaven and earth become human, possessing the qi of all four directions. Thus, humans are the noblest of heaven and earth and the most spiritually endowed of all things. The human head is round, mirroring heaven; the feet are square, treading earth. Facing south and turning north, left to the east and right to the west, ears sharp and eyes bright, hands raised and feet planted—all align with the proper order. Dwelling at the center of heaven and earth, they occupy the position of *zi* and *wu*. The five human relationships—ruler and minister, father and son—and the five constant virtues—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom—are rooted in the heart and manifest externally.\n\nThose who receive qi that is clear, upright, and unobstructed become sages and worthies. Those who receive qi that is turbid, biased, and blocked become fools and the unworthy. Even those near the east tend toward benevolence and softness, while those near the west tend toward righteousness and hardness—such differences in endowment are inevitable. The Yi and Di barbarians, though human, are fierce and lack propriety and righteousness because they inhabit particularly biased lands, and thus their endowment is also biased. This is the work of qi, not of inherent nature.\n\nHumans stand upright, while birds and beasts lie horizontally, and plants grow sideways. Those that lie horizontally receive qi that is particularly biased. Thus, their heads face west, their backs to heaven, and their feet to earth—yet even within this bias, traces of benevolence and righteousness remain. Those that receive eastern qi embody benevolence; those that receive western qi, righteousness—thus occupying the positions of *mao* and *you*. Though birds lie horizontally, their heads are raised, slightly distinguishing them from beasts. Those that receive eastern qi embody benevolence; those that receive western qi, righteousness.\n\nCreatures with scales, shells, fur, or wings represent qi gradually entering the earth. Those that grow sideways receive the qi of the earth. Those that receive northwestern qi are hard; those that receive southeastern qi are soft. All kinds under heaven are encompassed thus.\n\nThe dragon receives the true east; the tiger, the true west. Hence, the east has the Azure Dragon, and the west, the White Tiger. The *Shuowen* states: The *lin* is the benevolent beast of the east, and the *qingyu* is the benevolent beast of the west. Generally, those that receive eastern qi have horns; those that receive western qi have fangs. Horns signify constant benevolence. Those that fall short are also gentle and docile, like cattle and sheep. Those that exceed are harsh and predatory, like jackals, wolves, dogs, and pigs.\n\nWestern beasts all move at night, while eastern beasts are dazzled by night. Only the dragon defies this pattern, for it is divine. Birds lie horizontally but raise their heads, their qi rising from the earth and gradually nearing heaven—thus they raise their heads and can fly. Those of the east and west ascend from below: their heads are short, their tails long, their feathers patterned. When about to fly, they must first soar upward. Those of the southwest descend from above: their heads are long, their tails short, their feathers dark and plain. When about to fly, they first plummet downward.\n\nWithin these creatures, benevolence and righteousness reside as well. Among those that ascend, the smaller are like chicks, flying close to the ground. The greater are like *luan* and phoenixes, soaring straight to heaven. Among those that descend, the smaller are like wagtails and cranes, flying near the celestial pole. Ducks and teals fly low to the earth, even entering water. In the southeast, birds are dazzled by night; in the northwest, they fly by night. From the *xu* hour to the *you* hour, they gradually enter the earth; from the *yin* hour to the *mao* hour, they gradually emerge from it.\n\nThus, in the west, creatures are like beetles and butterflies—often trapped, for their qi gradually sinks. In the east, creatures are scaled and feathered—often flourishing, for their qi gradually rises. Hence, creatures like tortoises and toads excel at concealment and stillness, while fish and snakes excel at transformation. The interplay of yin and yang, the rise and fall of qi, bring this about.\n\nPlants draw the qi of the earth, so they all grow downward, the opposite of humans. This reversal of qi—whether counterflow or compliant—admits no alternative. Those that grow in the east are supple: they wither in autumn and flourish in spring and summer. Those that grow in the west are hardy: they wither in spring and flourish in autumn and winter. Branches and leaves turn toward yin, their leaves never leaving the earth, so beasts lodge there and feed on their foliage. Trees reach toward heaven, so birds perch there and feed on their fruit. Such is the pattern.\n\nThe three directions of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* produce no life; all other directions do. Precisely because they produce nothing, heaven and earth generate themselves. This is why heaven and earth endure and life never ceases. The winter of the year, the dark and new moons, the night of the day—these are the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nZhang Guanwu said: A person’s lifespan of a hundred years—if reckoned by the long count of yin, one year adds one year. If reckoned by the division of yang, one year subtracts one year. Heaven begins with the odd numbers one, three, five, seven, and nine. From *zi* to *si*, from six to nine, from few to many, yang grows and yin wanes, its qi rising from below. Yang arises from below, as yang within yin. This is what is meant by yang first dividing to establish the great limit. When yang divides, it becomes empty—emptiness is yin. When yang reaches its peak, yin is born.\n\nEarth continues with the even numbers two, four, six, eight, and ten. From *wu* to *hai*, from nine to six, from many to few, yin grows and yang wanes, its qi descending from above. Yin arises from above, as yin within yang. This is yin growing to fulfill its finer count. When yin grows, it becomes full—fullness is yang. When yin reaches its peak, yang is born.\n\nThat yang first establishes the great limit is like a person’s lifespan of a hundred years, which has a fixed number. Yin comes to diminish yang, eroding its already fixed count. In terms of form and number, yin seems to add a year each year. In terms of division, yang truly subtracts a year each year. Thus it is said: When yang comes, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. It is not that yang departs—it is that yang is consumed by yin, exhausting its allotted number.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Speech must have order. Without order in speech, nothing can be accomplished. In the *Yijing*, *Gen*’s six in the fifth place says, “Restraining the cheeks.” The cheeks are the jaws and the carriage of speech. To restrain the cheeks is to speak without recklessness, with order—then others will readily listen and act, and regret can be avoided.\n\nHan-era Jia Yi had literary talent and a grand bearing, but his mind was narrow. When he undertook matters, he could not contain himself, bursting out with everything at once. He was restless and impatient, losing the sequence of his words. No wonder he met with failure. When Dou and Guan advised the emperor, they were modest and deferential, yet in the end, they accomplished nothing. Men like Han Xin, Deng Yu, and Zhuge Liang spoke with order, so their rulers readily listened, and they carried out their ways throughout their lives without altering their principles. How could this merely avoid regret? Their principles had a fixed pattern.\n\nSomeone asked: In *Xian*, the top six is the cheeks; in *Gen*, the six in the fifth place is the cheeks—why? The answer: In *Xian*, the top of *Dui* is the mouth; in *Gen*, the nine in the third place is the heart. Thus, the fifth yin line represents the cheeks.\n\nMaster Shao said: What makes humans more spiritually endowed than the myriad things is that their eyes can take in the colors of all things, their ears the sounds, their noses the scents, and their mouths the flavors. These—sounds, colors, scents, and flavors—are the substance of the myriad things. Eyes, ears, noses, and mouths are the functions of humans. When substance and function interact, the Dao of humans and things is complete.\n\nAll things under heaven possess principle, nature, and destiny. Only by exhaustively investigating them can they be used. If the eyes, ears, noses, and mouths of the world become one’s own, then the eyes see all, the ears hear all, the mouth speaks all, and the nose comprehends all. In this way, one takes the heart of the world as one’s own heart. The heart then plans all, and one can observe the ten thousand hearts with a single heart, the ten thousand bodies with a single body, the ten thousand things with a single thing, the ten thousand ages with a single age. One does not observe with the eyes but with the heart; not with the heart but with principle. What thing under heaven lies beyond this principle?\n\nThus it is said: In the tranquil observation of the myriad things, all are self-possessed. And again: Observing the myriad things from the perspective of heaven and earth, the myriad things remain the myriad things. Observing heaven and earth from the perspective of the Supreme Ultimate, heaven and earth are also things. If one can fully realize the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate, one can encompass heaven and earth, shape the myriad things, and hold creation in one’s grasp. How could the thousand thousand things be mere trifles, or the thousand thousand people mere common folk?\n\nHe also said: When the world is about to be well-ordered, people value conduct and righteousness. When the world is about to descend into chaos, people value words and profit. Valuing conduct fosters sincerity and solidity; valuing words fosters deceit and cunning. Valuing righteousness fosters modesty and deference; valuing profit fosters plunder and contention. Thus, the Three Kings valued conduct and entered into righteousness, while the Five Hegemons valued words and entered into profit. Even the likes of Boyi were surpassed—how could one bear to speak of it?\n\nIn the Three Dynasties’ eras of order, there was no governance that did not take the regulation of human relationships as its Way. In the Three Dynasties’ eras of chaos, there was no disorder that did not arise from the disruption of human relationships. To abandon human relationships is to become a barbarian.\n\nSince ancient times, no dynasty has slaughtered as many people as the Qin. Yet the slaughter of many does not always require the blade. It is said that when the people of the world have no path to survival, how much worse is it to kill them in great numbers with the blade?\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The human mind and the mind of the Dao, refined into one and held to the center\"—these sixteen characters alone determine the right and wrong of the self, the peace or peril of the world, and the order or chaos of the realm. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and their transmission to Confucius and Mencius embodied this. The long-lived rulers of the Three Dynasties established their hearts upon this and governed their states by it.\n\nAfter the passing of Master Meng, this learning was no longer transmitted, and the pursuit of profit and advantage took its place. From the Han and Tang onward, for fifteen hundred years, governance has been but a patchwork of makeshift repairs. Though some eras have known brief stability, the learning transmitted by the Two Emperors, Three Kings, Zhou, and Confucius has never once been fully realized in the world.\n\nScholars of the age, if they possess even a modicum of talent, refuse to humble their hearts and devote themselves to the work of the Confucian school or the practice of sagely learning. They seek only the abundance of their catch, unashamed by the impropriety of their gains, and mock those Confucians who adhere to rules, standards, and measures. This is why true learning has faded, and the world’s decline has grown ever steeper.\n\nHe also said: The difference between the noble person and the petty person, between rising and descending, lies in the slightest divergence at the outset of their intentions. Those who follow the heavenly principle ascend; they advance ever upward, day by day. Those who follow human desire descend; they sink ever lower, day by day. The petty person, ever descending, falls into deeper ruin with each passing day, dragged down by human desire as one drowning in water.\n\nIn the beginning, the division between rising and falling may seem slight, but over time, the gap widens immeasurably. Though one may possess wisdom and strength, even these cannot save or sustain them.\n\nThe ancients, recounting Confucius’ words, said: \"Those who know from birth are the highest; those who know through learning come next; those who learn through hardship come after. Those who suffer hardship yet do not learn—such people are the lowest.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Those above the level of the average person may be spoken to of higher things.\" Only the supremely wise and the utterly foolish cannot be changed.\n\nBan Gu said: Since the creation of written records, we may know of the early people. The classics and their commentaries speak of the emperors before Tang and Yu, who bore titles and regalia, though their ministers cannot be named. The various masters, however, have much to say of them. Their purpose was to make virtue manifest, expose evil, and admonish later generations, so their words have been preserved and transmitted.\n\nExplanations of the classics’ meanings are called *zhuan* (traditions). It is said: \"If one associates with Yao, Shun, Yu, Hou Ji, or Yi for goodness, they will act accordingly; if one associates with the likes of Gonggong, Huan Dou, or others who seek evil, they will be punished. Those who can be led to goodness but not to evil are called the supremely wise. Jie, Zhou, Long Feng, and Bi Gan sought to lead them to goodness but were punished; the reckless warriors of Jie’s court and the flattering ministers of Zhou’s court led them to evil, and they acted accordingly. Those who can be led to evil but not to goodness are called the utterly foolish. Duke Huan of Qi, when aided by Guan Zhong, became a hegemon; when aided by Shu Diao, he fell into chaos. Those who can be led to either goodness or evil are called the average person.\"\n\nThus, the nine ranks are established, and the classics and their traditions are thoroughly examined. The succession of generations is arranged to encompass the essentials of antiquity and the present:\n\nThe highest of the highest, the sagely ones: Fuxi, the Taihao Emperor; Shennong, the Yan Emperor; the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan; Shaohao, the Jintian clan; Zhuanxu, the Gaoyang clan; Emperor Ku, the Gaoxin clan; Emperor Yao, the Taotang clan; Emperor Shun, the Youyu clan; Emperor Yu, the Xiahou clan; Emperor Tang, the Shang clan; King Wen of Zhou; King Wu; and the Duke of Zhou; and Confucius.\n\nFuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor are the Three Sovereigns. Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Gaoxin, Yao, and Shun are the Five Emperors—this is already stated in the *Preface to the Book of Documents*. Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu are the Three Kings.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou, son of King Wen, younger brother of King Wu, and uncle of King Cheng, established rituals and composed music, personally bringing about great peace—his sagely virtue cannot be surpassed. Confucius traced his lineage to Yao and Shun, taking King Wen and King Wu as his models. Above, he aligned with the celestial seasons; below, he followed the patterns of water and earth. He composed the Six Classics, leaving instructions for ten thousand generations. From Fuxi to Confucius, he synthesized the great accomplishments of all.\n\nThe historian Ban [Gu] classified the worthies of antiquity and the present into nine ranks. These fourteen sages he rightly placed in the highest of the highest. Yet why did he further divide the upper-middle and below into eight ranks? Names and realities do not match; confusion and disorder prevail, all losing their proper order. I have appended the critiques of Zhang and Yan to the end.\n\nZhang said: Laozi’s silence was what Confucius took as his teacher. Though not among the sages, he was surely a great worthy. Wenbo’s father was well-versed in ritual canons; his actions were praised by the sages, and his words became models for later generations—yet he was placed in the fourth rank. Tian Dan, with the isolated city of Jimo, restored the might of Qi; Lu Lian’s broad learning made him indifferent to glory and profit; Lanzi overawed the King of Qin and deferred to Lian Po—yet these were ranked fifth. The Grand Concubine Ji indulged in sorcery and was fond of sacrificing to ghosts and spirits; the people of Chen emulated her, and the state abounded in licentious sacrifices. The eunuch Mencius violated the great elegance, preserving himself only through castration; filled with resentment, he composed biting satires—yet these were ranked sixth. The depravity of Miao Du’s lewdness, confounding and disordering ritual norms, was too vile to recount—yet he was placed in the seventh. The remaining discrepancies are numerous and tangled.\n\nOriginally, this work was not yet complete when I encountered the disaster of the Dou family, which may explain such errors.\n\nYan said: The theories of the six schools differ in weight. The hundred practices vary in their inclinations and rejections, making uniformity difficult. Zhang expressed his views and selectively cited the *History of Ban*. Yet even in his compilation, there are still significant inconsistencies. He merely recognized the titles of the ancient emperors and kings. As for the various personages recorded in the histories and biographies, no explanation is needed. Only when matters are obscure or uncertain does he occasionally address them.\n\nShaozi said: Among people, there are differences of tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, each further divided into sixteen grades. From the supreme emperors and kings above to the scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants below, the worthy and the foolish stand far apart, utterly distinct.\n\nMan is the highest of all creatures. The sage is the highest of men. If one being is born among a trillion creatures, is he not a man? If one man is born among a trillion men, is he not a sage?\n\nThus, among a thousand thousand commoners, one who divides himself from the multitude is a petty man. Among one by one scholars, one who encompasses a trillion people is a great man. Creatures vary in size, and men vary in worth.\n\nTherefore, it is said: There are men who are worth one man, ten men, a hundred men, a thousand men, ten thousand men, a hundred million men, and a trillion men.\n\nIt is also said: Men are of three ranks, wherein good and evil reside. The highest rank is good without teaching; the middle rank becomes good after teaching; the lowest rank remains ungood even after teaching. Those who are good without teaching—what are they if not sages? Those who become good after teaching—what are they if not the worthy? Those who remain ungood even after teaching—what are they if not fools?\n\nNow, when we speak of teaching, we mean teaching those who can be taught. Those who cannot be taught are beyond the reach of instruction. Though they cannot be taught, they may still be warned, perhaps to avoid falling into vicious power.\n\nThus, those who do good are called auspicious men, and those who do evil are called inauspicious men. The auspicious man’s eyes do not gaze upon colors contrary to ritual propriety, his ears do not hear sounds contrary to ritual propriety, his mouth does not speak words contrary to ritual propriety, and his feet do not tread upon ground contrary to ritual propriety. He does not associate with those who depart from the Dao, nor does he accept what is not righteous. He seeks the worthy as if starving or parched, and avoids evil as if fleeing a pit or net. His goodness is like gold and stone, his weight like hills and mountains, his bearing like the luan and phoenix, and his qi like orchids and irises.\n\nSome say: If he is not called an auspicious man, the Five Constants are not to be believed.\n\nThe inauspicious man’s speech is perilous and rash; he pursues fame and chases wrongdoing. He indulges in wine and lust, hates the upright and reviles the just, delights in disaster and rejoices in misfortune. He resents the good and virtuous as if they were enemies, and violates laws and statutes as if they were his bedding. In minor cases, he harms himself and destroys his nature; in major cases, he overthrows his clan and severs his ancestral sacrifices.\n\nSome say: If he is not called an inauspicious man, I do not believe it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: Without the accumulation of good, one cannot establish a name. Without the accumulation of evil, one cannot destroy oneself. This is what is meant.\n\nMaster Zhang of Nanxuan said: Men are of three ranks. The highest does not change, the lowest does not change, and those who sway this world are always the middle rank. When gentlemen gather in the court, all are transformed to goodness—then there are two parts gentlemen to one part petty man. When petty men gain influence, the middle rank is all drawn in—then there are two parts petty men to one part gentleman.\n\nI say: Kangjie’s words teach men to do good. Nanxuan’s words urge the court to employ the goodness of gentlemen. When the household is ordered, the state is governed. The words of these two masters may serve as a model for ten thousand generations.\n\nShao further said: In the age of Yao and Shun, it was difficult to be a petty man. Though the Four Fiends existed, they could not unleash their evil. In the age of Shang Zhou, it was difficult to be a gentleman. Though the Three Benevolent Ones existed, they could not fully realize their goodness. This, too, depends on how those above transform and change.\n\nMaster Cheng said: By nature, men are similar; by habit, they grow apart. This refers to the nature of qi and disposition, not the original nature.\n\nMaster Zhang said: After form comes the nature of qi and disposition. Returning to it, the nature of Heaven and Earth remains. Thus, in the nature of qi and disposition, the gentleman has that which is not nature.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Among men’s similar qi and dispositions, there are also fixed differences of beauty and ugliness that cannot be altered by habit—these are the utterly foolish.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the original nature?\n\nHe replied: Mencius’s teaching of the goodness of nature is correct. This is what Master Cheng called the nature of the utmost origin and the most profound source. This is what Master Zhang called the one source of the ten thousand things—the nature of Heaven and Earth. It is the flowing of heavenly principle before receiving life, what is called “tranquil at birth.” What lies beyond this cannot be spoken of; it may also be called fate.\n\nSpeaking of it in terms of principle, without admixture of qi and disposition, it is the original state that Heaven-and-Earth bestows upon the ten thousand things—pure and perfectly good. Descending into man, it resides within qi and disposition. Thus, it is said to be inherently good. Returning to it, the nature of Heaven and Earth remains. This means that the nature of Heaven and Earth has never departed from within qi and disposition. Thus, it is said: After form comes the nature of qi and disposition.\n\nAgain, he was asked: What is the nature of qi and disposition?\n\nHe replied: What gives birth to the ten thousand things is principle. What generates the ten thousand things is qi and disposition. Men and things receive this qi and disposition to form their shapes, and the principle within them is called nature. However, what is called qi and disposition has unevenness in its bias, correctness, purity, impurity, clarity, obscurity, thickness, and thinness. Thus, the nature within it also varies in its manifestations.\n\nGaozi’s saying that “life is what is called nature,” Master Cheng’s “nature of birth and disposition,” Xunzi’s “nature is evil,” Yang Xiong’s “good and evil are mixed,” and Han Yu’s “three ranks” all refer to the nature of qi and disposition, yet they do not know the original nature.\n\nI say: Mencius taught the goodness of nature and understood the root, yet he did not speak of qi and disposition, which is why he gave rise to the disputes of Xun, Yang, and Han. Thus, Master Cheng said: To discuss nature without discussing qi is incomplete. Xun, Yang, and Han spoke of the nature of qi and disposition, yet they did not know what nature truly is. Only after more than a thousand years after Confucius and Mencius, with the advent of Lian and Han, did this become clear.\n\nThus it is also said: To discuss qi without discussing nature is unclear. Huang Mianzhai remarked: Master Zhang of Hengqu distinguished between the nature of Heaven and Earth and the nature of qi and disposition, after which Master Zhu’s doctrine was established. Truly, these words are correct.\n\nIt is further said: Qi may be biased or upright, and the principle it receives follows accordingly in bias or uprightness. Qi may be dull or bright, and the principle it receives follows accordingly in dullness or brightness. When wood-qi is abundant, metal-qi declines, hence benevolence is often plentiful while righteousness is often scarce. When metal-qi is abundant, wood-qi declines, hence righteousness is often plentiful while benevolence is often scarce. Such is the nature of qi and disposition, which possesses both good and evil. Since there exists a nature of good and evil in qi and disposition, it is not the original nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one seeks it in Zisi’s “centrality before arousal,” when this heart is unaroused, its center is serene, and myriad thoughts do not arise—this is the pure and perfectly good nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, though qi may be biased, principle remains upright; though qi may be dull, principle remains bright. Though qi may be deficient or excessive, principle knows no victory or defeat. Yet when it is stirred by external things, qi moves and principle follows. Or principle moves and qi carries it along—thus the perfectly good principle submits to qi, and good and evil are thereby distinguished.\n\nThe late Master once said: Before this heart is aroused, qi does not act. This is why there is good without evil. It is further said: Why is nature near while habit is distant? It is replied: Speaking of what is constant, those whose nature is good become habituated to goodness and daily advance toward loftiness and clarity. Those whose nature is evil become habituated to evil and daily sink into filth and baseness. Speaking of what changes, those whose nature is good may become habituated to evil and lose their goodness. Those whose nature is evil may become habituated to goodness and lose their evil. In all four cases, they begin close but end far apart.\n\nCiting Master Cheng’s words: Human nature is originally good. Speaking of talent, however, there are those of the lowest stupidity who cannot be changed. There are two kinds of lowest stupidity: self-abandonment and self-neglect. If one governs oneself with goodness, there is nothing that cannot be changed. Even the most dull and foolish can gradually be polished and improved. Only the self-abandoning reject it with disbelief, and the self-neglecting sever it with inaction. Though they dwell with a sage, they cannot be transformed and entered—this is what Confucius called the lowest stupidity. Yet their endowment is not necessarily dull and foolish. Often they are strong-willed and surpass others in talent and strength, as was the case with King Zhou of Shang. The sage, seeing that they have cut themselves off from goodness, calls them the lowest stupidity. Yet examining their end, they are indeed foolish.\n\nIt is also said: The moment one becomes lax is the moment of self-abandonment and self-neglect. Master Zhu said: The self-abandoning have a defiant intent. They do not despise ritual and righteousness but simply refuse to listen to good words. The self-neglecting have a weak intent. They acknowledge that ritual and righteousness are good and accept others’ advice, yet they themselves do not act.\n\nMaster Zhang said: When virtue does not overcome qi, one’s nature and destiny are commanded by qi. When virtue overcomes qi, one’s nature and destiny are commanded by virtue. To exhaust principle and fulfill nature is to align one’s nature, Heaven, virtue, destiny, and the heavenly principle. What cannot be changed in qi is only life and death, longevity and premature death. Thus, in discussing life and death, one says “it is destiny,” speaking of qi. In discussing wealth and honor, one says “it is in Heaven,” speaking of principle. This is why great virtue necessarily receives destiny.\n\nMaster Lü said: The reason the noble person studies is to transform qi and disposition. When virtue overcomes qi and disposition, the foolish can advance toward clarity and the weak toward strength. If one cannot overcome them, then even with the aspiration to study, the foolish cannot become clear and the weak cannot stand firm.\n\nThat which is uniformly good without evil is nature, common to all people. That which is endowed with varying degrees of dullness, brightness, strength, and weakness is talent, differing among people. Sincerity is the means to return to what is common and transform what differs. To seek beauty from an unlovely endowment requires a hundredfold effort to achieve it. Now, with a careless and reckless approach to study—sometimes practicing, sometimes stopping—one attempts to transform an unlovely endowment. When it fails to change, one says, “My endowment is not beautiful; it cannot be transformed by study.” This is truly self-abandonment, and its unbenevolence is extreme.\n\nThat great virtue necessarily receives destiny means that virtue is principle. Master Cheng said: To act is to carry out the heavenly mandate, to reach the heavenly principle. To necessarily receive destiny is to obtain its response. Heaven’s retribution is like shadow and echo. To receive its retribution is the constant principle; not to receive it is the exceptional principle. Yet people, in their shallowness and narrowness, seek it amiss, for the heavenly mandate cannot be altered. However, what can be altered is within the power of those with virtue. Through cultivation, one may extend years and generations. Praying to Heaven for eternal destiny, or for ordinary people to become sages and worthies—all follow this Way.\n\nMaster Hou said: Those who obtain the constant are like Shun. Those who do not obtain the constant are like Confucius. Shun rose from a commoner to possess the world—those who plant nurture it. Jie fell from Son of Heaven to a commoner—those who overturn topple it. Heaven does not establish or abolish principles for Shun or Jie; it is inherently so. Extending this principle, one can grasp the pattern in all things.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Transformation does not occur in a single day through sudden enlightenment. The advancement of human virtue is likewise. “At thirty, one stands.” Before reaching thirty, one must stand; one must begin at fifteen with the aspiration to learn and gradually transform. “Not deluded,” “knowing destiny,” “ear harmony,” and “following the heart” are all the same.\n\nMaster Hu said: “At fifteen, Confucius aspired to learn.”\n\nWhat is this learning? It is the Great Learning—the Way of cultivating the self, ordering the household, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world.\n\n\"At thirty, one stands.\" What does it mean to stand? It means dwelling in the world’s broadest dwelling, establishing oneself in the world’s proper position, and walking the world’s great Way without retreat.\n\n\"At forty, one is not deluded.\" What does it mean to be not deluded? It means that neither wealth nor honor can corrupt, neither poverty nor lowliness can sway, and neither power nor force can bend—standing resolutely above the myriad things.\n\n\"At fifty, one knows Heaven’s mandate.\" What does it mean to know? It means the four virtues of Qian—origination, prosperity, advantage, and perseverance—are practiced with clarity, flowing harmoniously with the myriad things, each attaining its proper place without disorder.\n\n\"At sixty, one’s ear is attuned.\" What does this attunement mean? It means that what passes is transformed, what remains is spirit-like, nearly attaining the realm of Heaven.\n\n\"At seventy, one follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the bounds.\" What does this mean? It means that one’s movements are of Heaven, and thus it is so.\n\nZigong said: \"When the Master governed a state or household, those he established stood firm, those he guided advanced, those he pacified came, and those he moved harmonized—could Heaven alone achieve such? I say: The Sage’s learning knows no bounds with Heaven, like laying the foundation for a thousand myriad years. Yet his aspirations were vast and enduring, so before thirty, he transformed every fifteen years. Entering the learning of the great person, he opened his resolve, and after another fifteen years, having long maintained his course, what he learned remained unchanged, and he stood firm with established virtue. Thereafter, he advanced steadily, transforming every ten years, progressing gradually. Having passed beyond doubt, he advanced to firmness, thus penetrating the principles of all things as they ought to be, without uncertainty. After another ten years, knowing Heaven’s mandate, doubt was no longer worth mentioning. This heart and Heaven’s mandate flowed together without obstruction. After another ten years, his understanding entered his heart, and nothing hindered him—he attained without deliberation. Through long accumulation of cultivation, he reached the state where his heart’s desires followed without transgressing the bounds. In these ten years, he acted with ease, hitting the mark without effort. For the Master’s learning was the learning of the great person of Qian. The first thirty years were divided into two stages to open the foundation of his vast and enduring resolve. The latter thirty years were divided into three stages to reach the state where his heart’s desires followed without transgressing the bounds. Unshakable was his resolve in learning, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity to stand firm. Knowing the end as well as the beginning was freedom from doubt. Harmony between sound and qi was attunement of the ear. Thus he saw Heaven’s pattern without transgressing the bounds. Therefore it is said: The great person harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth, his brightness with the sun and moon, his order with the four seasons, and his auspices and omens with ghosts and spirits. How could this be achieved by a single day’s effort? Thus I say: The Master’s learning was the learning of the great person of Qian.\n\nHuang Mianzhai said: Some explain that the Sage established standards with humble words to encourage others, but if the Sage’s words were all empty and vain, how could they reflect the Sage’s upright and magnanimous heart? Profound indeed is this saying. Master Zhu also said: The Sage did not feign humility while being truly sagely in heart. He further said: \"Extending knowledge\" and \"making intentions sincere\" are two thresholds for learners. Extending knowledge is the threshold between dream and awakening; making intentions sincere is the threshold between good and evil. Passing through the threshold of extending knowledge is awakening, otherwise one remains in dream. Passing through the threshold of making intentions sincere is goodness, otherwise one remains in evil.\n\nHeaven is man, and man is Heaven. At the beginning of a person’s life, what he receives from Heaven is already within him. Once this person exists, Heaven is also within him. All speech, sight, hearing, and movement are of Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Hold fast to Heaven’s bright mandate,\" always seeing this principle clearly before one’s eyes. Learning the basics is a matter of practice. Principle resides within practice. If one can fully master the basics, then learning the basics leads to reaching the heights, and Heavenly principle is present. This is what it means for a person to be born—principle and qi unite. All thoughts, considerations, words, and deeds are qi, yet principle abides within them. Thus the Five Constants and the myriad virtues all manifest principle.\n\nMaster Zhen of Xishan said: \"Exhausting principle\" pertains to knowledge, leaving no thing uninvestigated. \"Fulfilling nature\" pertains to action, leaving no principle unembodied. When knowledge is fully exhausted and action is fully realized, one reaches the mandate. The mandate is what Heaven bestows upon me. The round outside and the hollow within are the substance of the heart; empty spirituality and awareness are its function; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are its principles.\n\nMaster Hu of Wufeng said: Great indeed is nature! The myriad virtues are complete within it. Heaven and Earth are established thereby. A spring-fed stream, though cold, does not freeze. A person of virtue, though in dire straits, does not falter. When the sun sets, its light is entrusted to the moon. When Confucius passed, the Dao was entrusted to Meng. Master Zhou said: The sage emulates Heaven, the worthy emulates the sage, and the scholar emulates the worthy. Yi Yin and Yan Yuan were great worthies. Yi Yin felt shame if his lord was not like Yao or Shun, and if a single person was not in their proper place, it was as if he were flogged in the marketplace. Yan Yuan did not shift his anger, did not repeat his errors, and for three months did not stray from benevolence. Aspire to Yi Yin’s aspirations, learn what Yanzi learned. Surpass them and you become a sage; equal them and you become a worthy; fall short and you still do not lose a good name.\n\nMaster Zhu said: According to the depth of one’s effort, one reaches near or far without losing a good name, for one possesses the reality of doing good. Thus Master Hu said: If one dissuades people from making official rank, wealth, and family prosperity their aim to seek favor, then say: \"Aspire to Yi Yin’s aspirations.\" If one dissuades people from taking knowledge and learning as attainment and complacently resting without seeking to advance, then say: \"Learn what Yanzi learned.\" Only when one truly establishes Yi Yin’s aspirations and cultivates Yanzi’s learning does one realize that the words of the *Tongshu* encompass the utmost greatness, and the undertakings of the Sage’s gate are boundless.\n\nI say: For scholars who wish to transform their qi and disposition, nothing is greater than emulating the sage and emulating Heaven. Yet one must begin by emulating the worthy. Yi Yin, while plowing at Xin and delighting in the Dao, never lacked Yan Yuan’s learning. Yan Yuan, though dwelling in a humble alley, asked about governing a state, never lacking Yi Yin’s aspirations. Had these two great worthies exchanged places, both would have been the same. If scholars can reflect on themselves and be sincere, not engaging in superficial adornment, emulating them will surely succeed. Establish resolve and study with sincerity, without shame before oneself. Serve parents and follow elder brothers with sincerity, without shame before one’s family. Be loyal, trustworthy, earnest, and respectful with sincerity, without shame before one’s village.\n\nAdvance in thought to exhaust loyalty with sincerity, without shame before one’s office. Possess the goodness of substance prevailing, without the disgrace of reputation prevailing. Proceeding thus and holding fast, the worthy may be emulated. Abiding in nature and resting in it, the sage may be emulated. Its subtleties are invisible when issuing forth, its fullness is inexhaustible when expanding, and Heaven may be emulated. Those who aspire to the resolve of Yi and the learning of Yan—can they not seek these within themselves?\n\nMaster Cheng said: When the expansive power is fully realized, then Heaven and Earth transform and the grasses and trees flourish abundantly. When the expansive power is not realized, then Heaven and Earth close and the worthy withdraw into obscurity.\n\nMaster Zhu said: What one does not desire, do not impose upon others. Simply persist in expanding and advancing, and the myriad things will each attain their proper place. Expand it within a single household, a single state, or the entire world, and none will fail to attain their proper place. How then could Heaven and Earth not transform, or grasses and trees not flourish? If the expansive power is not realized, then upon stepping outside, one immediately encounters obstruction.\n\nThe *Book of Mencius* is simply about expanding the expansive power, daily gathering in one’s straying heart. This is drawing inward from without, daily knowing and expanding it. One must also push outward from within, hence it is said: Cultivate the self and the world is at peace—all of this does not go beyond the single word *shu* (reciprocity).\n\nMaster Zhu said: Reverence to straighten the inner, rightness to square the outer. These eight characters are inexhaustible in a lifetime’s use. When reverence is established, the inner is straight; when rightness takes form, the outer is square—this can be relied upon for a lifetime. Rightness is the heart’s judgment in affairs. When the heart judges within, the outer becomes square and upright, and the myriad things each attain their due.\n\nThe *Cinnabar Scripture* says: When reverence overcomes indolence, there is good fortune; when indolence overcomes reverence, there is ruin. When rightness overcomes desire, there is compliance; when desire overcomes rightness, there is misfortune. Reverence stands upright; indolence collapses. Acting according to principle is rightness; not acting according to principle is desire.\n\nFurthermore, the character *zhi* (straight) is explained by *jing* (reverence), and *fang* (square) by *yi* (rightness). Reverence without rightness leads to errors in conduct. Rightness without reverence lacks a foundation. Only when reverence and rightness are established together does one avoid the isolation of \"straightening the inner with reverence.\" \"Squaring the outer with rightness\" is the work of learning.\n\n\"Straight\" means direct and unobstructed, with no trace of crookedness in the breast—this is the meaning of decisive and square integrity. Reverence is like a mirror; rightness is the reverence that can reflect. Without rightness, reverence is dead and lifeless, not the living reverence.\n\nIt is also said: One must make this a fundamental concern. When nurturing it to the point of thorough penetration, \"reverence to straighten the inner\" naturally leads to \"rightness to square the outer.\" Even in quiet sitting, one must examine reverence and dissipation. Reverence is the heavenly principle; dissipation is human desire. In one’s dwelling, one must examine whether one is respectful or not; in handling affairs, whether one is reverent or not.\n\nThere are those who focus solely on understanding the state of quiescent non-movement. Yet when they encounter affairs, they become utterly disordered, disturbing even their quiescent state. Others focus solely on handling affairs but neglect the foundational work. One must be thorough from top to bottom, penetrating both inner and outer, to be truly adequate.\n\nIt is also said: Reverence is the virtue of Heaven. Reverence thoroughly penetrates above and below, without distinction from Heaven.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Do not be irreverent\"—this can be used to respond to the Lord on High.\n\nMaster Fan said: The three hundred canons of ritual and three thousand rules of decorum—one phrase summarizes them all: \"Do not be irreverent.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: Yao was the first sage to emerge and govern; the *Canon of Yao* in the *Book of Documents* is the first canonical text. In describing Yao’s virtue, no other word is used before \"reverent.\" Now, when examining the sages and worthies, though their words number in the thousands, and their affairs range from great to small, none do not originate in reverence. When one gathers one’s spirit here, one can fully perceive the principle, and only then can one cultivate the self, order the household, and extend it to the world.\n\nWhat form or shadow does reverence have? It is simply the gathering of body and mind. Not allowing a single thing to intrude is to be single-minded. Mingdao taught people to sit in quietude, as did Master Li. One must sit quietly to gather oneself; only then, when facing affairs, will one have strength.\n\nIt is also said: The character *jing* (reverence) pervades both movement and stillness.\n\nMaster Zhen said: If the winter qi fails to close and store properly, and warmth prevails without frost or snow, then the following year’s yang qi will lack strength, and the five grains will not ripen. The human heart is the same. If in stillness one is scattered and anxious, how can one be measured in activity? Thus Master Zhou took \"abiding in stillness\" as fundamental, and Master Cheng took \"abiding in reverence\" as fundamental—both express this principle.\n\nMaster Hu of Wuyi said: The single character *jing* (reverence)—after ten years of devoted practice, one must distinguish it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: It seems that even Heaven and Earth have a governing principle; only then can they undergo their transformations—this is the reverence of Heaven and Earth. That by which King Tang could match the Lord on High began with his daily ascent in sagely reverence.\n\nI note: Master Lü of Donglai said: Reverence is the first word transmitted by the hundred sages. Where the sagely learning applies effort, even in the *Book of the Charge*, it is said: The subtle transmission of the Duke of Zhou was received by King Cheng. As he neared his end, he revealed it to his ministers. The subtle transmission of Confucius was received by Zengzi. As he neared his end, he revealed it to Meng Jingzi. Both centered on reverence alone.\n\nThe complete embodiment of the Supreme Polarity in the sage requires no cultivation yet remains in reverence—how much more so for scholars! Those who know this and cultivate it are the good fortune of the noble person; those who do not know this and act contrary to it are the misfortune of the petty person. Whether one cultivates or acts contrary depends entirely on the distinction between reverence and dissipation.\n\nWhen reverent, desires diminish and principle becomes clear. Diminishing them further and further to the point of nonexistence, the sagely learning may be emulated. Thus Master Zhu said: What Master Cheng contributed most powerfully to later scholars was the single character *jing* (reverence).\n\nScholars, can you not strive for this?\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Eighteen, concludes.\n\nFrom \"from the reign of Duke Xiang to that of Kings Cheng and Kang\" through \"the timing of the seasons\"—all these passages were originally omitted and have been restored according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\nFrom \"It is further said: Observing people within the celestial cycles, there is not a moment of leisure\" to these passages—all were originally omitted and have been restored according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\n\"In vain\" (*tu*)—the *Siku Quanshu* edition reads \"to bring about\" (*zhi*).\n\"Of\" (*zhi*)—originally \"not\" (*bu*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\"Barbarians\" (*yi*)—the *Siku Quanshu* edition reads \"bandits\" (*dao*).\n\"To act\" (*zuo*)—the *Siku Quanshu* edition reads \"world\" (*shi*).\n\"Barbarians\" (*yi*)—the *Siku Quanshu* edition reads \"bandits\" (*dao*).\n\"In\" (*yu*)—originally \"son\" (*zi*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\"Qi\" (*Qi*)—originally \"spring\" (*chun*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\nThe character \"next\" (*ci*) was originally omitted and has been restored according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\"Grand\" (*tai*)—originally \"great\" (*da*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition; \"hidden\" (*fu*)—originally \"mysterious\" (*xuan*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.\n\"Blazing\" (*yan*)—originally \"fire\" (*huo*), emended according to the *Siku Quanshu* edition.

It is the pivot of creation and transformation, the root and foundation of all things.\n\nIn Heaven and Earth, the Supreme Polarity exists within them, like a hinge in a door or a knot in a garment—it grasps the essential framework. In the myriad things, the Supreme Polarity exists within them, like a root in a tree or a trunk in a plant—it establishes their fundamental basis.\n\nTo call it \"non-being\" (*wu*) is to say that within the vast and formless, the ten thousand images are already fully present. To call it \"being\" (*you*) is to say that in the primordial state, before even a single thing existed, it could not be exhaustively explained.\n\nAs principle (*li*), it is supremely lofty yet does not abandon the lowly; supremely subtle yet does not depart from the manifest; supremely refined yet does not mingle with *qi*; supremely numinous yet does not stagnate in things. Between Heaven and Earth, what has not yet been born is born, what has not yet emerged emerges—none escapes birth and death within its domain.\n\nLike the Northern Asterism, fixed in its place, while the circumpolar stars and the Seven Governors revolve around it day and night, what moves is all suspended from this, yet what makes it so has never itself moved.\n\nThe *Great Commentary on the Changes* states: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity.\" Master Zhu [Xi] replied to Cai Xishan: \"That which opens and closes, comes and goes without end, does so because it possesses this principle.\" With this principle, Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operates within them.\n\nTwo produces four, four produces eight. By the time of eight, three transformations occur in succession, and the Three Powers (*sancai*) become visible. The sages followed this, drawing the Eight Trigrams to embody the marvelous transformations of the *Changes* and determine fortune and misfortune.\n\nOnly afterward can this be expressed in writing; the word *Changes* (*Yi*) itself cannot be so expressed. *Yi* means \"transformation.\" The intermingling of *yin* and *yang*, the thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, all emerge from this. This is what the Master [Confucius] meant by the \"formless *Changes*\"—speaking of transformation as formless yet possessing an ultimate principle. It encompasses both movement and stillness, the already-manifest and the not-yet-manifest.\n\nThe Supreme Polarity is the marvel of *xing* (nature) and *qing* (emotions), the principle of movement and stillness, the already-manifest and the not-yet-manifest. Within the Supreme Polarity, there is nothing but goodness. As for the three hundred eighty-four lines [of the *Yijing*], where good and evil appear, these arise only after the transformations of *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThe *Comprehensive Record* states: \"Sincerity (*cheng*) is the non-doing of the Supreme Polarity; the incipient (*ji*) is the good and evil of *yin* and *yang*.\" The virtues—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—are the Five Phases (*wuxing*), all explained in terms of the Diagram.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity, which is the Great Void (*Taixu*).\" *Yin* and *yang* arise when the Great Void gathers into *qi*. Softness and hardness arise when *qi* gathers into form. Benevolence and righteousness are born from the Great Void, manifest in *qi* and form, and activated in consciousness.\n\nDivided into two, they become *yin* and *yang*. Divided into five, they become the Five Phases. Divided into the ten thousand affairs and things, all share this single origin, which is called *xing* (nature).\n\nNanxuan said: \"The Supreme Polarity is the name for the convergence of the ten thousand principles, the marvel of *xing* (nature).\" If one speaks only of *xing* and not of the Supreme Polarity, focusing solely on the not-yet-manifest, its functioning remains unseen. By calling it the Supreme Polarity, the marvel of *xing* becomes apparent.\n\nViewed from the perspective of individual endowment, it is called *ming* (destiny). Viewed from the perspective of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, it is called *li* (principle). Each of the ten thousand things possesses its own principle—this is \"one Supreme Polarity in each thing.\" The ten thousand principles all emerge from a single source—this is \"one Supreme Polarity encompassing all things.\"\n\nThis fool says: The \"Polarity\" (*ji*) is omnipresent. The \"Polarity of the People\" (*minji*) has the meaning of convergence; the \"Northern Polarity\" (*beiji*) has the meaning of a pivot; the \"August Polarity\" (*huangji*) has the meaning of a standard. To call it the \"Supreme Polarity\" (*Taiji*) is to speak of the source. This principle alone stands prior to the Two Modes (*yin-yang*) and the Five Phases, and operates within them.\n\nThough it has no form of convergence, it is in truth the convergence of the ten thousand things. Though it has no form of a pivot, it is in truth the pivot of the ten thousand things. Though it has no form of a standard, it is in truth the standard of the ten thousand things.\n\nMaster Zhou said: \"Non-polar (*wuji*) yet Supreme Polarity.\" This fool notes: Master Cheng said this sentence expresses the principle of \"the vast and formless, where the ten thousand images are already fully present.\" Cai Jieqi said: \"This clarifies the statement in the *Changes* that 'the *Changes* possesses the Supreme Polarity,' revealing the true reality of the Non-polar and the insight gained from the Master’s single word on the *Changes*.\" Those who consider it an arbitrary addition are mistaken. Here, I cite six statements from Master Zhu to explicate this sentence.\n\nThose that take the Supreme Polarity as their subject are three:\n1. Before images and numbers take form, the principle is already present.\n2. Before Heaven and Earth existed, this principle was ultimately present.\n3. The Non-polar (*wuji*) merely states that in the beginning, there was originally not a single thing—only this principle, which then gives rise to movement and stillness, producing *yin* and *yang*.\n\nThose that take *yin* and *yang* as their subject are also three:\n1. Viewed from the perspective of *yin* and *yang*, the Supreme Polarity resides within them. Today, some say that above *yin* and *yang* there exists another formless and shadowless entity called the Supreme Polarity—this is incorrect.\n2. The Supreme Polarity is simply the principle of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things, each of which contains a Supreme Polarity.\n3. It is not that there is something separate from *yin* and *yang*; rather, within *yin* and *yang*, one points to their fundamental substance, speaking of it without mingling it with *yin* and *yang*.\n\nWhen speaking of the Supreme Polarity in terms of the Supreme Polarity, it exists prior to *yin* and *yang*, before *yin* and *yang* have arisen. When speaking of the Supreme Polarity in terms of the generation of *yin* and *yang*, it exists within *yin* and *yang*, after *yin* and *yang* have arisen. To say that beyond *yin* and *yang* there exists a separate Supreme Polarity is mistaken.",

      "translated_text": "Those who insistently regard it as their master fall inevitably into the error of Liezi’s \"neither arising nor transforming.\" Those who cling solely to the claim that the Supreme Polarity exists within *yin* and *yang* remain blind to where the Great Root truly lies.\n\nSome say: before *yang* there is *yin*, and before *yin* there is *yang*. To speak of it in terms of *yin* and *yang* not yet arisen may raise doubts. Yet if one takes the moment just before the first stirring of *yang* and calls it the state before *yin* and *yang* have arisen, this may also be acceptable. Though *yin* and *yang* have not yet arisen, the principle that generates *yin* and *yang* is already fully present in the human heart as the \"center before arousal\"—this is collectively named the Supreme Polarity.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The Supreme Polarity is what points to the root of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things; the Non-Polar is what reveals the wondrousness of the soundless and scentless. Because it has no vessel or form, yet the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things are all contained within it, it is called the Non-Polar. And because the Supreme Polarity encompasses the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things yet has no vessel or form, it is called the Supreme Polarity, which is fundamentally non-polar. It exists before there are things, yet it is never absent after things come to be. It is said to be beyond *yin* and *yang*, yet it never fails to operate within *yin* and *yang*. If one speaks of it as pervading the entire body, present everywhere without exception, then there is nothing to be said of sound, scent, influence, or trace. Its loftiness reaches the Non-Polar, and the subtlety of the Supreme Polarity truly does not depart from the inquiries of daily life.\n\nHe also said: \"The bearing of high Heaven\" speaks of the Non-Polar within the realm of existence. \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" speaks of existence within the realm of the Non-Polar. The Non-Polar describes the wondrousness of the soundless and scentless; the Supreme Polarity names the ultimate perfection of this principle. Tracing downward from the Non-Polar and Supreme Polarity, the ten thousand things each attain their proper place, and the great and small are fixed in measure—each thing possesses a Supreme Polarity. Tracing upward from the Supreme Polarity, which is fundamentally non-polar, the ten thousand things are one, and the one is truly the ten thousand parts—all things share a single Supreme Polarity in their totality. Though the two *qi* and five phases give rise to humans and things, tangled and intertwined in endless transformations, the Supreme Polarity moves within them, inherently ordered and structured, not a chaotic void. Thus, when something is sensed externally, the center responds internally; whatever one encounters before the eyes is this principle. Great and small, joy and sorrow...\n\nI heard from my teacher: Zhou Dunyi’s phrase \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" is a forward expression; \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" is a reverse expression. \"The bearing of high Heaven, soundless and scentless\" is like Zhou’s \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity.\" If one were to reverse the lines of the *Odes* and say, \"Soundless and scentless, the bearing of high Heaven,\" how would this not also be acceptable? The phrase \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" does not mean that the Non-Polar is placed above the Supreme Polarity. Xiangshan refused to acknowledge the phrase \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" and attacked only the first line, pointlessly engaging in contentious debate. If I had met Xiangshan, I would have dared to ask the late learner, still unenlightened: \"Please show me the Supreme Polarity.\" Xiangshan would surely have become furious: \"The Supreme Polarity is a formless thing, the fundamental principle upon which the great earth is rooted. How could you bring it forth to look at? I have nothing to present, and you have nothing to see—this is the Non-Polar.\" Thus, Zhou Dunyi’s \"Non-Polar yet Supreme Polarity\" and \"the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally non-polar\" are truly unassailable discussions for all time.\n\nHe also said: From the Supreme Polarity to the transformation and generation of the ten thousand things, it is all but a single cycle. In the second cycle, Zhou Dunyi separated out a circle above to show the supremely undifferentiated principle of the Supreme Polarity in its formless state. This cycle alone has existed since the beginning of Heaven and Earth, endlessly revolving within it. Bestowed within each of the ten thousand things, the principle of Heaven is complete, neither borrowing from nor encroaching upon others. The entire body of the Supreme Polarity is wholly present within this Non-Polar, and the two and five phases wondrously unite and congeal. Thus it is said: Every person possesses the Supreme Polarity, and every thing possesses the Supreme Polarity—all is naturally so. The difference between humans and things lies solely in the endowment of *qi*. Master Zhu’s explanation of the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity Unfolding* first shows people their origin, for only humans possess it. The subsequent stages show the foundation of the human Dao, enabling one to understand what makes a human human, a sage a sage, and why the noble and the petty each have their differing endowments of *qi*.\n\nSome say: The first part of the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity* resembles a chessboard, while the latter part resembles a person playing chess. I say: The upper circle represents the nature of Heaven and Earth; the lower circle, divided into *yin* and *yang*, contains the nature of *qi*-endowment. Master Shao said: The Dao is the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu said: This refers to the natural principle of Heaven, Earth, and the ten thousand things. I say: The Dao is the Supreme Polarity—there are not two principles. Some claim that the Dao is a separate, suspended entity existing prior to the Supreme Polarity, but then the Dao and the Supreme Polarity would be two. How could the Supreme Polarity exist outside the Dao? In terms of its all-pervading movement, it is called the Dao; in terms of its ultimate perfection, it is called the Polarity. The Supreme Polarity is the undifferentiated Dao; it is the Polarity from which all principles branch. Wherever these branching principles extend, there is the Dao. Like piercing the nose of an ox or bridling the head of a horse, it follows wherever it flows—how could the Polarity and the Dao be two principles?\n\nHe also said: The heart-mind is the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu said: This refers to the principle that humans receive as the master of their bodies. I say: The heart-mind is a spiritually luminous entity, the dwelling of human nature. The Polarity is the principle of utmost goodness, the form of human nature. When the heart-mind governs principle, the undifferentiated Supreme Polarity emerges. In responding to the ten thousand affairs, each thing possesses its own Polarity.",

      "translated_text": "Thus Master You said: In stillness without thought, before the myriad virtues arise, this is the Ultimateless. When this heart-mind is luminously clear, its spiritual source undimmed, this is the Supreme Polarity. If within stillness a single thought stirs, then movement and quiescence become yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Fu Xi composed the *Yi* beginning with the single line; King Wen expanded the *Yi* beginning with \"Qian's origination.\" They never spoke of the Supreme Polarity, yet Confucius did. Confucius commented on the *Yi* beginning with the Supreme Polarity, yet never spoke of the Ultimateless—until Master Zhou did. Fu Xi and King Wen explained from yin-yang downward; Confucius, in turn, revealed the Supreme Polarity from above yin-yang. Cai Jitong said: \"Had Heaven not given birth to Confucius, all ages would have been as a long night.\" Heaven first gave birth to Fu Xi and King Wen; had Confucius not come after, three thousand years would have been lost. Had the Cheng brothers and Master Zhou not come after, it would have been the same.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Without Fu Xi and King Wen’s *Yi*, there would be no *Yi*; without the Master’s discourse on the Supreme Polarity, people would not know the *Yi*’s root. Knowing the root, without Master Zhou’s discourse on the Ultimateless, people would not know the root of the Supreme Polarity. The *Yi* is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity’s root is the Ultimateless. Once the subtlety of tracing things to their origin is made clear, the hearts of people across myriad ages will all know where to find their ultimate refuge.\n\nMaster Zhu once said: Master Zhou’s explanation of the Ultimateless and the Supreme Polarity is most excellent. He also cited Master Cheng’s discussion of Zhang Zai’s \"pure emptiness, one greatness,\" which leads people astray if parsed too finely—his meaning was profound. I have studied the earlier masters, consulted teachers and friends, and arrived at this understanding:\n\nThe *Yi* contains the phrase \"there is the Supreme Polarity.\" After Fu Xi and King Wen, none but Confucius could have articulated it. After Confucius, for fifteen hundred years, no one fully grasped it—until Shao Kangjie first recognized it as the root of the *Yi*, and Master Lianxi (Zhou Dunyi) first elucidated its meaning through the Ultimateless. The sages and worthies transmitted the Dao, gradually clarifying it to its most intimate essence.\n\nFrom antiquity past to eternity future, without this single phrase in the *Yi*, one might add the word \"change\" (*yi*) to the Supreme Polarity, thereby revealing the Supreme Polarity’s rootedness—not like the heterodox, who fall into emptiness and nothingness. This word *yi* is most subtle and profound; it is the wondrous locus of yin-yang transformation, what is called the *Yi* without form. It exists before the Two Modes and the myriad transformations, yet embodies their essence. Though not yet manifest as yin and yang, it is the source from which the Supreme Polarity emerges. To clarify its non-being is not to speak of emptiness, but to point to the most real principle within. Thus it is called *yi*, called \"being,\" called the Supreme Polarity—each word has its proper place. The Master feared people would not understand this principle, so he stated it clearly. To view the *Yi* merely as a book is to miss the mark entirely.\n\nMaster Zhou feared people would not grasp the principle of the Supreme Polarity, so he said: \"Ultimateless and yet Supreme Polarity.\" By using the two words \"Ultimateless,\" he explained the single word *yi* in the *Yi*, thereby clarifying the original meaning of the Supreme Polarity. Master Zhu, in turn, feared people would separate the phrase \"Ultimateless and yet Supreme Polarity\" into two, so he said: \"Each thing possesses its own Supreme Polarity.\" Knowing this, one understands that the two qi, the Five Phases, and the thousand transformations and myriad changes constitute the *Yi*. Yet within each thing resides a naturally complete and undifferentiated Supreme Polarity that cannot be altered. This principle fills the cosmos, present everywhere—people simply fail to recognize it.\n\n\"Production and reproduction is called *yi*\": this is the *yi* of \"there is the Supreme Polarity\" in the *Yi*. From this arise the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams. Not only within the *Yi* as a whole, but in every instance—whether in yin-yang, in male and female, in the human heart, or among the myriad kinds—each unfolds according to this principle, which cannot be altered. This is why the *Yi* generates yin and yang, yet transcends yin and yang. The *Yi* cannot be confined to yin-yang as its essence, nor can it be equated with the changes of yin-yang. Yin-yang is not the *Yi*; yin-yang’s transformations arise from the formless *Yi*. Thus I say: \"There is the Supreme Polarity in the *Yi*,\" for the *Yi* is without form.\n\n\"Without thought, without action\" is the root of the *Yi*. \"Establishing positions, arranging ranks, the *Yi* is established and enacted\"—this is the function of the *Yi*. In humans, it is called *yi*; in humans, it is called nature—none is apart from the one Supreme Polarity. The *Yi* of the Master (Confucius) speaks of \"there is\"; the *Yi* of Master Zhou speaks of \"without.\" Shaozi’s (Shao Yong) earlier teachings may follow a different path. Later generations, confused by theories of the *Yi*’s \"Great Beginning\" and \"Great Simplicity,\" lost the meaning of the single word *yi*. Those who take \"there is a thing formed in solitude\" as the sole transmission of the Supreme Polarity come close to the Master’s words, yet still fall short.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll One, concludes.",

I say: The heart-mind is a spiritually luminous entity, the dwelling of human nature. The Polarity is the principle of utmost goodness, the form of human nature. When the heart-mind governs principle, the undifferentiated Supreme Polarity emerges. In responding to the ten thousand affairs, each thing possesses its own Polarity.",

      "translated_text": "This chapter speaks of the Supreme Polarity (*Taiji*), wherein movement and stillness give rise to the division of yin and yang. The Supreme Polarity is without form, while yin and yang possess *qi*. Movement and stillness are *qi*; principle (*li*) rides upon *qi* and acts through it. The transformations of odd and even, the mutual engagement of female and male—those who obtain the yang *qi* follow the *qian* Dao and become male; those who obtain the yin *qi* follow the *kun* Dao and become female. *Qi* gathers to form shape, shapes interact and *qi* responds; yin and yang interweave and intermingle—this is the meaning of the *Yi*.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, there is only the ceaseless cycling of movement and stillness; beyond this, there is nothing more. Someone asked: \"Yang moves and serves as function; yin is still and serves as substance. Now Master Zhou speaks of the Supreme Polarity, saying that movement generates yang—yet he begins from the state of movement, so function precedes substance. Moreover, what was it like before movement began?\" I reply: Before movement began, it was principle—what is called 'the Non-Ultimate and yet the Supreme Polarity.' Principle should not be spoken of in terms of movement and stillness. Before movement, it is stillness; before stillness, it is movement; before movement, it is stillness again. Thus, principle has no opposite; it cannot be described in terms of movement and stillness. Rather, principle is revealed through movement and stillness.\n\nAs for Master Shao’s saying, \"Function arises before heaven and earth,\" and Master Zhu’s saying, \"The function of the Supreme Polarity is what enables its activity\"—both refer to the aspect of function. The deeper meaning of \"movement generates yang\" is that nothing can be said of what lies beyond it. Master Zhou said: \"The Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang. When movement reaches its limit, it returns to stillness, and stillness generates yin. When stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes are established.\" Master Zhu’s commentary on this chapter is most subtle and wondrous. He said: \"The Supreme Polarity’s possession of movement and stillness is the flowing forth of Heaven’s Mandate—this is what is meant by 'the Dao of one yin and one yang.' Sincerity (*cheng*) is the root of the sage, the end and beginning of things, and the Dao of the Mandate. Its movement is the unfolding of sincerity; what follows it is the goodness by which the myriad things are endowed with their beginning. Its stillness is the return of sincerity; what completes it is nature, by which the myriad things each rectify their natures and lives. Movement reaches its limit and becomes stillness; stillness reaches its limit and returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each serving as the root of the other—this is the flowing forth of the Mandate without cease. Movement generates yang; stillness generates yin. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes are established. Their division has a definite principle that does not shift.\"\n\nThe Supreme Polarity is the wondrousness of what is so of itself. Movement and stillness are the mechanism it rides upon. The Supreme Polarity is above form—it is the Dao. Yin and yang are below form—they are the vessels. I say: The Supreme Polarity is principle; movement and stillness are *qi*. The mechanism it rides upon is the bearing and carrying of movement and stillness. This principle rests upon *qi*, unaware that it moves and then is still, is still and then moves again. Thus it is said: The Supreme Polarity is like a person; movement and stillness are like a horse. The horse carries the person; the person rides the horse. The horse goes out and comes in; the person goes out and comes in with it. Therefore, the Supreme Polarity rides upon this *qi* of movement and stillness to generate yin and yang. When it moves, it is the Supreme Polarity of yang; when it is still, it is the Supreme Polarity of yin. Viewed from the perspective of yin and yang, yin and yang exist only within the Supreme Polarity. To say that the Supreme Polarity exists within yin and yang is also acceptable—yet if one clings to fixed forms, one may flow into movement without stillness or sink into stillness without movement, and things will not flow smoothly.\n\nThe spirit (*shen*) does not depart from form yet is not confined by form. Within movement there is stillness; within stillness there is movement—this is what is meant by the spirit’s wondrousness in the myriad things. Proceeding upward from the Five Phases and the two *qi*, one finds the root in the oneness of the Supreme Polarity. Movement and stillness, yang and yin—this is the origin of the myriad things’ single nature. Proceeding downward from the two *qi* and the Five Phases, one finds them dispersed into the ten thousand things. Stillness and movement, yin and yang—one reality divides into ten thousand parts, and the Mandate flows forth. In stillness, the Supreme Polarity merges and returns to oneness; in movement, the Supreme Polarity opens and scatters into the ten thousand things.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Does this mean the Supreme Polarity is also subject to division?\" I reply: It is fundamentally one Supreme Polarity. The myriad things each receive their allotment, and each in turn possesses a complete Supreme Polarity. It is like the moon in the sky—there is only one. Yet when it scatters upon rivers and lakes, its reflection appears everywhere. Can one say the moon is divided? One root, ten thousand branches; ten thousand branches, one root—there is no doubt about this.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Movement and stillness have no beginning; yin and yang have no origin. Movement generates yang, yet originally it was stillness. Above stillness, there must be movement. Before movement, there is stillness. Pushing upward, its beginning is without end—this is the Dao of Heaven. Beginning with yin, completing with yang, rooted in stillness, flowing into movement—this is the Dao of Humanity. Yet yang returns to its root in stillness, and stillness in turn is rooted in movement—its movement and stillness also have no beginning.\" He also said: \"Movement and stillness serve as each other’s root—the word 'root' most deserves careful consideration. There is movement and stillness that are already fixed and visible, and there is movement and stillness that are not yet fixed and not yet visible—these are the root of movement and stillness. This word 'root' is difficult to explain. To say that movement is rooted in stillness and stillness is rooted in movement is merely to speak of their mutual exchange and alternation, without distinguishing host and guest. The meaning is not fully conveyed; Master Zhu’s explanation is more rounded and lively.\"\n\nHe said: \"*Yuan* and *heng* are the unfolding of sincerity in movement. *Li* and *zhen* are the return of sincerity in stillness. *Yuan* is the constancy of movement, rooted in stillness. *Zhen* is the substance of stillness, manifest in movement—this is what is meant by *zhen*. It is how the myriad things complete their ends and begin anew. Thus, one cannot stand as a person without movement. The ultimate (*ji*) is fundamentally rooted in stillness; when what is manifest in movement is always properly regulated, it does not lose its original stillness. Stillness is how nature is established; movement is how the Mandate flows forth.\"",

      "translated_text": "Indeed, in every movement and stillness, the Mandate flows forth. Yet what courses through movement and stillness is the constancy of nature. Thus it is said: \"The constancy of the Limitless.\" This encompasses movement and stillness, and speaks of the equilibrium before activation—when expressed in terms of stillness, it seems to point to *zhen* as the root of movement and stillness.\n\nIn my humble view: movement generates yang, yet it does not move of itself. Rooted in the Supreme Ultimate, it moves forth to bestow upon the myriad things. Stillness generates yin, yet it does not still itself. Rooted in the Supreme Ultimate, it enters to rectify the nature and Mandate of each. Thus, the Supreme Ultimate is the root of Heaven and Earth, governing the qi of yin and yang, movement and stillness, to enact the power of generating and completing the myriad things. As its root, how could this be lightly spoken of?\n\nIt is further said: Like a hundred-foot tree, from root to branch and leaf, all is one continuous whole, indivisible. To treat movement and stillness as two separate matters is to gradually impose an artificial arrangement. The Supreme Ultimate is like a tree growing upward: first dividing into branches and trunk, then further producing flowers and leaves, endlessly generating. When it comes to bearing fruit, within it lies the principle of ceaseless generation. As it generates outward, there emerge limitless Supreme Ultimates. Without pause, it continues until the fruit is formed, at which point it naturally halts for a time. The *Book of Changes* states: \"In the beginning and ending of the myriad things, nothing surpasses *Gen*.\" *Gen* signifies the meaning of growth and rest. Creation naturally operates thus—how could it depend on human arrangement? All follows the principle of root and branch as one continuous whole.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Movement and stillness also constitute the Two Modes. One is *bianyi* (transformation), which is the flowing aspect; the other is *jiaoyi* (interchange), which is the correlative aspect. Movement and stillness generate yin and yang; continuing goodness and completing nature are the flowing aspect. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established—this is the correlative aspect. The movement of the Supreme Ultimate is the flowing aspect. When movement stills, it becomes the correlative of yin and yang. In correlation, it moves again to become flowing. Like the alternation of cold and heat, one is horizontal, the other vertical. Flowing returns to stillness and becomes correlation, as in Heaven and Earth, the four directions: east yang, west yin, south yang, north yin. Correlation is the substance; flowing is the function. The substance is still, and the function is dynamic—these two aspects of movement and stillness are why transformation is inexhaustible.\n\nWhat is called *bianyi* refers to yang transforming into yin, yin transforming into yang, old yang transforming into young yin, old yin transforming into young yang. This pertains to the methods of divination, such as the alternation of contraction and extension. What is called *jiaoyi* refers to yang interchanging with yin, yin interchanging with yang, as in the hexagram images where Heaven and Earth take their positions.\n\nIt is further said: After Mencius, no one understood nature. Beginning with Master Lianxi, who spoke of the uneven transformations of movement and stillness, yin and yang, and the Five Phases, the Cheng brothers thereby deduced the nature of qi and disposition. Before a person is born, only this principle exists. Upon receiving this principle and coming to life, it is then infused as nature. The nature of Heaven and Earth is purely this principle without admixture; when it reaches the realm of yin and yang and the Five Phases, it becomes qi and disposition. Speaking of principle and qi together, there arise differences in clarity and turbidity, thickness and thinness. Thus it is said: \"The Five Natures are stirred and good and evil diverge.\" Nature belongs to the formless realm and is entirely the heavenly principle. Qi belongs to the formed realm and is the sediment. As for physical form, it is the most turbid sediment of all.\n\nIt is further said: All people possess the principle of movement and stillness, yet they commonly lose it in movement. The sage fully embodies the virtue of movement and stillness, yet always roots it in stillness. The two words \"movement\" and \"stillness\" are correlative, a natural principle of Heaven. Without movement as its counterpart, stillness cannot be called stillness. Without stillness as its counterpart, movement cannot be called movement. Yet the movement of ordinary people flows into movement without stillness; their stillness sinks into stillness without movement. Thus, desires stir, emotions prevail, profit and harm contend, and they follow their inclinations like a rushing stream—scarcely different from birds and beasts. Only the sage is not thus. In movement, the principle of stillness is never lost; in stillness, the principle of movement never ceases. Therefore, their conduct is centered, their dwelling is upright, their actions are benevolent, and their judgments are righteous. In every movement and stillness, nothing fails to be complete. In the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate, nothing is lacking. Thus, what was previously called the stirring of desires, the prevailing of emotions, and the contention of profit and harm is settled here.\n\nBefore reaching this state, one cultivates it. Vigilance, apprehension, and reverence in stillness are constantly maintained—this is why the noble person is auspicious. Without understanding this and acting contrary to it, indulging in depravity and excess without restraint—this is why the petty person is inauspicious.\n\nMaster Shao said: Heaven is born of movement; Earth is born of stillness. At the beginning of movement, yang is born. At the extreme of movement, yin is born. At the beginning of stillness, softness is born. At the extreme of stillness, hardness is born. Within yin and yang, there are further yin and yang, hence the Greater Yin, Greater Yang, Lesser Yin, and Lesser Yang. Within hardness and softness, there are further hardness and softness, hence the Greater Hard, Greater Soft, Lesser Hard, and Lesser Soft.\n\nIn my humble observation: Master Shao’s explanation proceeds from the Supreme Ultimate to movement and stillness, thus \"One generates Two.\" From movement and stillness, yin and yang, hardness and softness divide, and \"Two generates Four.\" Further dividing into greater and lesser, \"Four generates the Eight Trigrams.\" From this, the numbers are drawn, and from this, the principles are extended—Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things cannot escape. Within the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate, all is so clearly ordered. Former scholars said of Kangjie that he saw clearly at the point where yin and yang intersect—how true are these words.\n\n**Movement and Stillness**\nThis chapter speaks of movement being rooted in stillness. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—all flow without ceasing.",

      "translated_text": "Yet it constantly takes stillness as its root. Without night, day would be indistinct. Without winter, spring, summer, and autumn could not bring forth growth and fruition. Just as one who engages in affairs all day must rest briefly to restore vitality, so too if the four seasons had no winter and only endless growth, the primal *qi* would eventually be exhausted. The *Book of Changes* says: \"Closing the door is called *Kun*; preceding the opening of the door is called *Qian*—this is movement arising from stillness.\" From the Summer Solstice, *Kun* proceeds with one yin moving rightward, and the myriad things follow it inward, thus it is called \"closing.\" From the Winter Solstice, *Qian* proceeds with one yang moving leftward, and the myriad things follow it outward, thus it is called \"opening.\" *Kun* closes, and yang transforms into yin; *Qian* opens, and yin transforms into yang. Thus, one closing and one opening are called \"transformation.\" Closing recedes, opening advances—endless transformations. In a year, this is cold and heat; in a day, this is night and day; in a person, this is the cycle of life and death. Without stillness, there is no movement. Is this not why the world takes *Kun* as its beginning?\n\nThough yin begins to arise at the Summer Solstice, it is not until the sixth yin line of *Wei* stands alone that one can speak of \"stillness reaching its extreme and giving rise to movement.\" The *Appended Remarks* of the *Book of Changes* says: \"Without thought, without action, utterly still and unmoving—yet when stimulated, it penetrates all things under Heaven.\" Master Cheng said: \"The *zhong* ('center') refers to utter stillness; the *he* ('harmony') refers to its responsiveness that penetrates all things. In its stillness, there is no moment when it does not respond; in its responsiveness, there is no moment when it is not still. This is the full embodiment of Heaven’s mandate and the utmost correctness of the human heart.\" Before it is aroused, one sees the substance of its responsiveness; after it is aroused, one sees the function of its stillness. The human heart and the principle of Heaven are one.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Between one movement and one stillness lies the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity!\" Yang opens and moves; yin closes and is still—this is one movement and one stillness. Not enslaved by movement, not bound by stillness, neither movement nor stillness yet governing both—this is the space between one movement and one stillness.\n\nSome say: The *Canon of Supreme Mystery* speaks of yang *qi* concealed within the chamber of *Huangzhong*—truly, it is present in all things. *Xin* (\"trust\") is nothing other than sincerity. Master Zhou’s *Comprehensive Discourse* says: \"*Yuan heng* ('origination and flourishing') is the unfolding of sincerity; *li zhen* ('benefit and perseverance') is the return of sincerity.\" Between one unfolding and one return lies a principle of true reality. This is likely the *zhen* (\"perseverance\") of *yuan heng li zhen*. What follows *zhen* is *li*; what precedes *zhen* is *yuan*. From *li* to *zhen*, the subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is stored and concealed here. From *zhen* to *yuan*, the subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is released and expressed here. To be upright and firmly sincere, unwavering and unerring—this is what is meant by \"endless transformations, yet the true reality of *zhen* lies here.\" The subtlety of *Wuji* (\"Without Ultimate\") and *Taiji* (\"Supreme Ultimate\") thus pervades the boundary between Heaven and humanity. The sage employs this principle, taking stillness as the foundation for establishing humanity. The ultimate truth lies precisely here. To call it \"the utmost subtlety\" is to emphasize that it cannot be captured in words or form. This subtlety is the great unfolding of creation.\n\nWhen movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness, this is death; when stillness reaches its extreme and returns to movement, this is life. When yang reaches its extreme and generates yin, this is transformation; when yin reaches its extreme and generates yang, this is change. One who can recognize the space between one movement and one stillness can thereby understand transformation, change, life, and death.\n\nIt is also said: Before *Wuji*, yin contains yang; after the appearance of images, yang divides yin. Master Zhu said: From *Gou* to *Kun* is yin containing yang; from *Fu* to *Qian* is yang dividing yin. Between *Fu* and *Gou* lies *Wuji*. From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is the time before *Wuji*. Master Zhu said: \"This merely describes the cyclical meaning of the diagram. When *Kun*’s yin has gathered to its utmost, and *Fu*’s yang is contained but not yet manifest, this is the stillness of its original state. It does not oppose movement but is the root of movement and stillness.\" Former scholars said: \"The stillness that does not oppose movement is *Wuji* and *Taiji*.\" At the time of utmost stillness, there is only the capacity for knowing and perceiving, without any object of knowledge or perception. In the *Book of Changes*, this corresponds to pure *Kun*, the image of no yang, yet possessing the utmost *zhen*. The indestructible principle resides within it. If we discuss the *Fu* hexagram, however, we must consider it as having objects of knowledge and perception—it cannot be conflated with the former.\n\nMaster Shao’s words—\"Where the first yang stirs, before the myriad things are born\"—likely refer to this idea. Viewed in terms of the human heart, this is the moment between desire stirring and not yet stirring. It is like the alarm and compassion felt when a child falls into a well—at this moment, this feeling can only be perceived with a mind empty of distractions and thoughts settled in stillness.\n\nNow, let us examine the diagram by extending it left and right. The right side of the diagram pertains to yin, which governs closing. Within yin lies yang—this refers to the movement from *Xun* waning to *Kun* gathering, the subtlety of stillness. This is the time before *Wuji*, when yin contains yang. The left side of the diagram pertains to yang, which governs opening. Yang departs and divides yin—this refers to the movement from *Zhen* growing to *Qian* dividing. This is the time after images appear, when yang divides yin. *Qian* generates one yin, thus it is said: \"The father gives birth to the eldest daughter, becoming *Gou*.\" *Kun* generates one yang, thus it is said: \"The mother conceives the eldest son, becoming *Fu*.\" This unites *Qian*’s yang and *Kun*’s yin, discussing the entire diagram as one. If we speak solely of *Wuji*, it resides only between *Fu* and *Gou*—we cannot loosely refer to it as existing after the appearance of images. Thus it is said: \"From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is the time before *Wuji*.\" It is also said: \"Between *Fu* and *Gou* lies *Wuji*.\" What does this mean? It is without movement or stillness yet contains movement and stillness; without yin or yang yet contains yin and yang. There is such a principle, yet no sign of its advance. Without sound or scent, utterly subtle and wondrous—this is what Master Zhou meant by \"*Wuji* and yet *Taiji*.\" It cannot be fully described in words.",

Within the undifferentiated Supreme Ultimate, all is so clearly ordered. Former scholars said of Kangjie that he saw clearly at the point where yin and yang intersect—how true are these words.\n\n**Movement and Stillness**\nThis chapter speaks of movement being rooted in stillness. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—all flow without ceasing.",

\"properly positioned.\"\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* states:\n\"As the year scatters toward its end,\nthe new year is about to begin.\"\nMaster Yichuan further said:\nHaving completed the end of the present year,\none must also consider the beginning of the coming year.\n\"End\" and \"beginning,\" \"present year\" and \"coming year\"—\nall form the Two Modes.\nAgain, when *Kun* transforms into *Kan*,\none hexagram becomes two.\nLast year’s yang *qi* ends here,\nand this year’s yang *qi* arises from this same point.\n\nMaster Zhu said:\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there are fixed boundaries—\nsuch as the four directions—\nand there are cyclical movements—\nsuch as the four seasons.\nThe north holds two meanings:\nfor instance, the forty-five days before the Winter Solstice belong to the present year,\nwhile the forty-five days after belong to the coming year.\nSimilarly, the four *ke* before midnight belong to today,\nand the four *ke* after belong to tomorrow.\n*Gen* governs the beginning and end of all things.\nThe Azure Dragon, White Tiger, and Vermilion Bird are each a single entity,\nwhile the Black Tortoise and Serpent are two.\nHeaven has spring, summer, autumn, and winter—\nits climatic patterns are uneven.\nEarth has east, west, south, and north—\nits boundaries are fixed and unchanging.\nThus the northwest region is both the Northern Beginning\nand simply the North.\n\nIn Heaven’s southeast, there is both sovereign fire and ministerial fire.\nThe sun and moon are the true essences of yin and yang,\ngiving rise to water and fire.\nThus among the seven luminaries, there is the sun and also fire,\nthe moon and also water.\nIn the human body’s five viscera,\nthe heart has the pericardium,\nand the kidneys have the Gate of Life.\nWater and fire each have two aspects,\nwith sovereign fire and true essence truly interconnected.\nTrue fire has *qi* but no form—\nthis is what is meant by \"the heart being singular while the kidneys are paired.\"\nThe Vermilion Bird is one, while the Black Tortoise and Serpent are two.\nThus the heart is singular, while the kidneys are paired.\nIn the trigrams of *Qian* and *Kun*,\nthe north is represented by both tortoise and serpent.\n\nIn Kan’s *Book of Changes*, *Li* contains the image of the tortoise,\nas well as armor and helmets.\nThe tortoise has a shell—hence its martial aspect.\n*Sun*, *Yi*, and *Yi* all mention the tortoise,\nand their interlocking trigrams contain *Li*.\nDrawing *qi* inward resembles the image of yang lying hidden beneath the earth.\nOn its back, at the center, are five lines,\nwhich extend outward to form the Eight Trigrams,\nand further outward to form the twenty-four solar terms.\nThis imagery is apt,\nyet it remains unclear why it corresponds to the twelfth earthly branch,\nas *si* does not occupy the northern position.\n\nKan’s *Records* and *Book of Documents Commentary*\nmake no mention of this—why?\nPerhaps the character *xuan* (玄) curves and winds like a serpent,\nand when transformed, becomes a dragon.\n*Zhen* represents the dragon lying beneath *Kun*—\nthis may relate to the meaning of *Fu*, but requires separate investigation.\n\nSome say:\nYang *xuan* belongs to the serpent,\nwhile martial yin belongs to the tortoise.\nMaster Wang stated:\nThe kidneys are two, and so are the tortoise and serpent—\nthus the Northern Beginning pertains to *zhen* (貞),\nwhich has two meanings: uprightness and constancy.\nThe character *zhi* (智) also has two meanings:\nits first half, representing gathering and storage, belongs to yin;\nits latter half, representing opening and release, belongs to yang.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* states:\nThe tortoise and serpent roam in four directions,\nsymbolizing the celestial lodges.\nThe tortoise has a shell, enabling defense—hence its martial aspect.\nIts color is black—hence *xuan* (玄).\nMaster Wei said:\nThe male does not dwell alone,\nnor does the female live in solitude.\nThe Black Warrior—tortoise and serpent—\ncoil and intertwine in mutual support.\nIf a hen crows at dawn,\nher chicks will not thrive.\nObserve the moment of mating between male and female:\nhard and soft intertwine, inseparable.\nThey follow their natural rhythms,\nwithout need for artifice or control.\nWhen a boy is born, he lies prone;\nwhen a girl is born, she lies supine—\nthis is how they received *qi* in the womb,\nand in death, they return to this state.\nThis is not taught by parents—\nit is the marvel of creation’s spontaneity.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan said:\nOne singular, one paired—\nthese are the complementary forms of yin and yang.\nThree yangs and one yin—\none abundant, one deficient—\nthese are the functions of yin and yang.\nThus in the four seasons, spring, summer, and autumn generate life,\nwhile winter does not.\nHeaven and Earth’s east, west, and south are visible,\nwhile the north is not.\nIn human vision, what lies ahead and to the sides is visible,\nwhile the back is not—\nall these are the marvels of creation’s spontaneity.\n\nYang Xiong took the north as *xuan*,\nencompassing the three directions.\n\"Boundless\" and \"dark\"—\nhis intent lies precisely here.\nNow, examining the *Tai Xuan*,\nits text reads: \"Boundless, straight, obscure, chief, dark.\"\n\"Boundless\" is the north—\nwhere the ten thousand things lie hidden in the Yellow Springs, beyond naming.\nThus the ten thousand things are \"boundless\" in the north,\n\"straight\" in the east,\n\"obscure\" in the south,\nand \"chief\" in the north.\n\"Boundless\" is where being emerges from non-being.\n\"Dark\" is where brightness conceals itself in obscurity.\n\"Boundless\" releases its *qi*—\nyang *qi* is contained within.\n\"Dark\" returns to its depths—\nthings lie in the Yellow Springs.",

The nature of Kun is compliant, and its most expansive formed manifestation is Earth. Inspired by poetry, he further says:\n*\"Gazing upward at the encompassing Mystery, in a single breath it races ten thousand miles.\nLooking downward at the square norm’s stillness, it abides in collapse through a thousand ages.\"*\nThus its vigor and compliance are evident.\n\nMoreover, within the cosmos, all things undergo decline and rest. Only Heaven moves without ceasing—each day passing one degree, never pausing. Heaven is not like Earth, which possesses form; above Earth, there is nothing that is not Heaven. For every foot of Earth, there is a foot of Heaven—it is merely that people do not perceive it. That which is light and pure, ascending and floating, is Heaven. Heaven is round and in motion, enveloping Earth within its midst. Earth is square and still, and thus heavy and turbid, sinking downward—all being the dregs and congealed sediment of Heaven’s qi settling below. In its origin, it was but a single qi. Divided into two, yang encompasses yin, while yin does not encompass yang. Thus Qian Heaven’s One embraces Kun Earth’s Two to become Three.\n\nEarth resides within Heaven, and Earth’s qi is entirely Heaven’s qi. Master Zhang [Zai] says: *\"The Void is the ancestor of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth emerge from the Void. Its Dao takes utmost emptiness as true reality. Gold and iron may corrode, mountains and peaks may crumble. All things possessing form are easily destroyed, yet the Great Void knows no disturbance—thus it is the most real. ‘What Heaven above bears has neither sound nor scent’—this is perfection.\"*\n\nHe further states: *\"The empty and void, containing nothing, is that from which the myriad things arise.\"*\n\nMaster Shao [Yong] says: *\"Heaven faces one center to divide creation.\"* Heaven is originally One; with Earth, it divides into Two. Yang is originally one line; with yin, it divides into two lines. Thus, in every affair and thing, all are pressing toward Earth. Where there is growth, there is decline; where there is a front, there is a back—all is natural, not something human effort can contrive. The so-called *\"prior to Heaven, one thing is absent\"* requires no arrangement to be so.\n\nHe further says: *\"If we speak of the prior-Heaven single line, as soon as there is One, there is Two, Four, Eight, and Three Hundred Eighty-Four—though from this point onward it unfolds, how could it require arrangement?\"*\n\nYaofu asked Master Cheng: *\"Do you know how thunder arises?\"*\nYichuan replied: *\"I know it.\"*\nYaofu said: *\"I do not.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Having known it, why resort to tedious calculation?\n\nYaofu asked: *\"From where does it arise?\"*\nYichuan replied: *\"It arises from where it arises.\"*\nYaofu, struck with sudden insight, praised this answer.\n\nI say: Thunder arises from the One at Heaven’s root—this is the division of creation from within the One.\n\nHe further says: *\"Heaven relies on form; Earth clings to qi.\"*\nSomeone asked Yaofu: *\"To what does Heaven cling?\"*\nHe replied: *\"Heaven clings to Earth through qi.\"*\n*\"To what does Earth attach?\"*\n*\"Earth attaches to Heaven through form.\"*\nHeaven and Earth naturally depend on each other.\n\nSpeaking of their essence: Heaven divides to become Earth, and Earth divides to become the myriad things. Yet the Dao cannot be divided. In the end, the myriad things return to Earth, Earth returns to Heaven, and Heaven returns to the Dao. Heaven’s ceaseless motion alone holds Earth suspended at its center—were Heaven’s singular movement ever to pause, Earth would plunge downward, and all people would perish.\n\nMaster Cheng Bozi said: *\"Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and all living things within Earth are Heaven’s qi.\"*\nMaster Cheng Shuzi said: *\"Wherever there is qi, it is Heaven; wherever there is form, it is Earth.\"*\nMaster Zhang said: *\"The void is qi. Wherever there is a heaven and earth, there is a span of qi.\"*\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Heaven’s form is round like a pellet, revolving day and night. Its north and south poles, higher behind and lower in front, are the unmoving pivot. What revolves has no fixed substance—it is but a fierce wind spiraling upward and downward without cease, the body of Heaven though not truly a body. Earth, however, is the dregs of qi condensed into form and substance. Yet bound within the fierce wind’s rotation, it remains steadfastly afloat in space, never falling.\"*\n\nThe Yellow Emperor asked Qibo: *\"Does Earth have support?\"*\nQibo replied: *\"The great qi lifts it.\"* This is what he meant.\n\nUpon careful reflection: Qian is originally a single line, its substance entirely solid, like a single thing. From within, it expands to fill all of Heaven. The qi of Heaven’s inner covering all penetrates Earth’s center. Kun, however, divides into two lines—its capacity is thus hollow, allowing for opening and closing. Earth’s form is like the lungs: though its substance is solid, its center is empty. When Qian’s qi rises, Kun opens to either side, admitting Heaven’s qi to surge upward. Even metal and stone are permeated.\n\nHeaven’s form is like a drum’s skin, its outer layer enclosing abundant qi. As the *Monthly Ordinances* states in *First Month of Spring*: *\"Heaven’s qi descends; Earth’s qi ascends.\"* From the eleventh month, it accumulates until the fourth month, forming Qian. Qian’s qi lies beneath Kun, steaming upward like rice in a steamer. Yet in the fifth month, a single yin arises; by the seventh month, three yins below form Kun, and three yangs above form Qian. Heaven’s qi ascends, Earth’s qi descends—Heaven and Earth are cut off, sealed to become winter.\n\nIn the beginning, there were only the two qi of yin and yang. As they ground against each other, dregs rapidly accumulated within, with no exit. The sediment of water congealed into Earth, fixed at the center. Today, climbing high to view the mountains is like watching waves—akin to tide-borne sand rising. The extreme heat of fire’s qi generates wind, thunder, lightning, the sun, stars, and the like.\n\nHeaven has nine layers, each ascending purer than the last. The clear and firm qi becomes Heaven; without firmness, it could not envelop and nurture. Heaven is merely a whirlwind, spinning outward and inward, spinning out dregs to form Earth at its center. Thus Master Shao said: *\"Its form has limits; its qi is boundless.\"* And again: *\"The Dao is the root of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the root of the myriad things. Viewing the myriad things through Heaven and Earth, they are indeed myriad things. Viewing Heaven and Earth through the Dao, they too are but things.\"*\n\n*\"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\"* The Dao belongs to what is above form; yin and yang belong to what is below form. The great yin and yang of Heaven and Earth disperse into the myriad things, which are born bearing Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang qi. All confined within form and vessels are called things. Each thing possesses a single Supreme Polarity—this is called the Dao.\n\nThus, observing Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things by form, Heaven is great and the myriad things small. Observing them by the Dao, Heaven and Earth are but one thing within the Supreme Polarity.\n\nDong Guangwei said: *\"Gazing at the moon through drifting clouds, the moon moves while the clouds do not. Boarding a boat to cross water, the water flows while the boat does not.\"* These words carry meaning.\n\nMaster Zhou said: *\"Observe the vital force of Heaven and Earth in generating things.

      "translated_text": "It is said: *\"Movement is not the heart of Heaven and Earth, but only reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nRegarding the *Fu* hexagram, if viewed from the *xiantian* (pre-celestial) perspective, the single yang line emerges only after the *Bo* hexagram’s top yang (ninth line) transforms into the *Kun* hexagram’s top yin (sixth line), with thirty parts already accumulated by the tenth month. Like a child within the mother, the heart of Heaven and Earth in generating things remains concealed. Yet if viewed from the *houtian* (post-celestial) perspective, the single line beneath *Kun* suddenly transforms into *Zhen*, originally a *Gen* hexagram. When *Gen* is inverted, within the stillness of yin’s cessation, the mechanism of yang’s revival and flow becomes manifest. Like a child outside the mother, the heart of Heaven and Earth in generating things is then clearly visible.\n\nThe qi of the primordial unity never pauses for even a moment, ceaselessly giving rise to the myriad things. Heaven and Earth merely contain this vast qi within, with no outlet. Each time it gathers, it generates another round of beings. The workings of creation resemble a mill grinding out life—what emerges is both refined and coarse, never uniform.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"The four seasons proceed, the hundred things are born.\"* This is grand and evident, revealing the disposition of Heaven and Earth, yet it describes their effortless aspect. If they were truly without heart, then cows would give birth to horses, and peach trees would bear plums, for their heart would have no constancy.\n\nMaster Cheng said: *\"To call it ‘Emperor’ is to speak of its governance; the heart is precisely where it governs.\"* In the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents*, wherever the idea of governance appears, it is called *Di* (Emperor). Wherever the idea of encompassing and universal coverage appears, it is called *Tian* (Heaven).\n\nNanxuan remarked: *\"One cannot take the azure vault alone as Heaven. One must seek it in the realm of seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—wherever a single thought arises, there is the presence of the Supreme Emperor.\"* *\"The Lord on high watches over you; His scrutiny is ever in His heart.\"* The moment a thought strays, it is as if divine wrath descends.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"One must understand that it is without heart, yet also recognize that it has a heart.\"* Heaven envelops Earth, and what Heaven enacts is merely the knowing of generating things—this is a heart without intention. Yet when it rewards good and punishes evil, it seems as though there is a governor within. Similarly, the rising of winds and falling of rains, the crashing of thunder and flashing of lightning, the blooming and fruiting of flowers—how could these occur without a spirit?\n\nIt is further said: *\"All men under Heaven are the qi of Qian; all women under Heaven are the qi of Kun.\"* From this, extending upward and downward, all is one qi. Though it permeates all, even the most minute and hidden things, down to the finest hair, none lack the image of Qian and Kun.\n\nAll the myriad sounds under Heaven arise from opening and closing; all the myriad principles arise from movement and stillness; all the myriad numbers arise from odd and even; all the myriad forms arise from square and circle—all originate from the two lines of Qian and Kun.\n\nIn terms of physical form, it is called Heaven; in terms of governance, it is called Emperor; in terms of function, it is called ghosts and spirits; in terms of its wondrous workings, it is called spirit.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the outer shell of Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are the nature and disposition of Heaven and Earth. It is simply that this qi, when it wills to generate, generates—nothing less than utmost vigor can achieve this.\n\nThat which is rooted in Heaven turns upward: the heads of all moving creatures face the same direction, as do humans. That which is rooted in Earth turns downward: the heads of all plants point downward, as do grasses and trees. The heads of birds and beasts are often horizontal, which is why they lack intelligence.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is above; thus, the brain below gives rise to many things. Regarding the single origin of the myriad things, principle is the same while qi differs. Observing the distinct forms of the myriad things, qi remains somewhat similar, yet principle diverges entirely.\n\nQi is similar in that all beings know cold and warmth, recognize hunger and satiety, love life and hate death, pursue benefit and avoid harm—humans and creatures are alike in this. Principle differs in that, for instance, ants have a semblance of ruler and subject, revealing a trace of righteousness; tigers and wolves have a semblance of parent and child, revealing a trace of benevolence. Beyond this, further distinctions cannot be drawn.\n\nThis is why Heaven and Earth serve as the outer shell, encompassing all things within. Qian and Kun are their nature and disposition, which, as bestowed, vary in each being.\n\n*The Western Inscription* states: *\"Qian is called Father, Kun is called Mother; humans dwell within, embodying the way of the child.\"* Thus, the yang of Qian and the yin of Kun fill the space between Heaven and Earth, and all beings rely on them for their bodies. The vigor of Qian and the compliance of Kun are the aspirations of Heaven and Earth, leading the qi, and all beings derive their nature from them. This is why humans receive the uprightness of nature and destiny, becoming the most spiritually endowed of all beings, while other creatures receive only a partial endowment, sufficing for their kind alone.\n\nMaster Zhang said: *\"From the Great Void comes the name of Heaven; from the transformations of qi comes the name of the Dao. The union of void and qi gives the name of nature; the union of nature and consciousness gives the name of heart.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Originally, it was one Great Void, gradually refined into greater density.\"* The Great Void is the totality; speaking of the transformations of qi—those of yin and yang, the workings of creation, cold and heat, day and night, rain and dew, frost and snow, mountains and rivers, grasses and trees, metal and water, fire and earth—does not depart from it. Though discussed in terms of the manifold transformations of qi, in truth, it does not leave the Great Void.\n\nThe Great Void is the circle above the Supreme Ultimate, within which yin is still and yang is dynamic. With this qi, principle resides within; without this qi, principle would have no place to abide.",

      "translated_text": "Like the moon reflected in water—only with this water can the moon above be mirrored. Qi has form, while the Great Void has no path. Through the forms of the tangible, the principle of the intangible is possessed, hence the consciousness of nature and heart. This is the luminous clarity of qi’s emptiness. Sight, hearing, action, and function—all depend on this consciousness to activate this principle.\n\nMaster Shao said: *\"Only with yin and yang can heaven be generated; only with hardness and softness can earth be generated.\"* The *Record of Rites* states: *\"Ritual fundamentally arises from the Supreme One, which divides to become heaven and earth.\"* The Supreme Ultimate is where qi has not yet appeared. The Great Beginning is the inception of qi. The Great Commencement is the inception of form. The Great Simplicity is the inception of substance. These four phrases together discuss the state before heaven and earth and the beginning of heaven and earth. Here, the origins of principle, qi, form, and substance are explained. Of all things, none are greater than heaven and earth.\n\nHeaven is born of movement. The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; yang, being light and pure, floats upward to become heaven. It is also said: *\"Yin and yang generate heaven, for yang is rooted in yin.\"* Thus, in heaven as yin and yang, there are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Earth is born of stillness. The Supreme Ultimate is still and generates yin; yin, being heavy and turbid, sinks downward to become earth. And it is said: *\"Hardness and softness generate earth, for yin is rooted in yang.\"* Thus, on earth as hardness and softness, there are water, fire, soil, and stone.\n\nSpeaking from their root, the Supreme Ultimate moves to generate yin and yang, thereby generating heaven and earth. Speaking separately: at the beginning of movement, yang is born; at the extreme of movement, yin is born. The alternation of one yin and one yang exhausts heaven’s function, hence it is said that yin and yang can generate heaven. At the beginning of stillness, softness is born; at the extreme of stillness, hardness is born. The alternation of one hardness and one softness exhausts earth’s function, hence it is said that hardness and softness can generate earth.\n\nRegarding heaven and earth as one qi: yang ascends from below. Ascension is generation, generating yang to dissolve yin. Yin descends from above. Descent is dissolution, generating yin to dissolve yang. Speaking of the two qi separately: that which ascends from below is yang born within earth. From *zi* to *si*, it completes *qian*, generating heaven. At *wu*, heaven reaches its center, then generates yin to establish yang. Once established, yang proceeds again, rotating left as the Way of Heaven. That which descends from above is yin born within heaven. From *wu* to *hai*, *kun* is fully generated as earth. At *zi*, earth reaches its center, then generates yang to establish yin. Once established, yin proceeds again, rotating right as the Way of Earth.\n\nGenerating heaven gives birth to the myriad things; generating earth brings them to completion. *Qian* and *kun* use only six lines, with six as the central number. Advancing six is an end; retreating six is a beginning. The end of day is the beginning of night; the end of night is the beginning of day. Comprehending day and night, one knows that the numbers of the *Yi* can exhaust the beginnings and ends of heaven and earth, clarifying the principle of waxing and waning.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Qian and kun determine the positions of above and below; kan and li arrange the gates of left and right.\"* Heaven has four images, earth has four images. Heaven has eight images, earth has eight images. Heaven and earth interlock, yin and yang intersect. Heaven governs the operation of the four seasons; earth governs the embodiment of the hundred things.\n\nIn the *Xiantian* arrangement, *qian*, *kun*, *kan*, and *li* correspond to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—the four cardinal directions, encompassing both above and below. Thus, the opening and closing of heaven and earth, the rising and setting of the sun and moon, the four seasons, the dark and new moons, the crescents and full moons, the lengthening and shortening of days and nights, the degrees of celestial motion, and the waxing and waning of all things arise from these four images.\n\nIn heaven, yin and yang are old and young; including the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, they become eight. On earth, hardness and softness are old and young; including water, fire, soil, and stone, they also become eight. As for their interlocking: in the *Xiantian* diagram, the left side has one hundred twelve yang and eighty yin, and the top is the same; the right side has one hundred twelve yin and eighty yang, and the bottom is the same. As for their intersection: like male and female, husband and wife, yin and yang, *qian* going to intersect *kun* forms *fu*, and *kun* coming to intersect *qian* forms *gou*.\n\n*Qian* and *kun* stand divided in the center of yin and yang, establishing the bodies of heaven and earth. *Kan* and *li* intersect in the center of yin and yang, bringing forth the functions of heaven and earth. Yin and yang originally use *kan* and *li* to transform heaven and earth; heaven and earth in turn use *kan* and *li* to generate the myriad things.\n\nIn the *Houtian* arrangement of King Wen’s eight trigrams, the positions differ, with *kan*, *li*, *zhen*, and *dui* occupying the four cardinal directions, while the remaining four trigrams occupy the four corners. Why is this? The North Star resides in the north, slightly to the west, where the celestial spirits dwell, hence the northwest is *qian*. Kunlun resides in the west, slightly to the south, where the earthly spirits abide, hence the southwest is *kun*. Nothing stirs the myriad things like wind; as qi moves from east to south, the southeast is *xun*. Of the Five Peaks, none is more revered than the Eastern Peak; as earth’s form extends from north to east, the northeast is *gen*.\n\nIt is also said: *\"Heaven is round and earth is square.\"* Heaven is high in the south and low in the north, so when observed, it appears like an overturned bowl. Tang monk Yixing said: *\"The *gaitian* model is like a painted sphere, showing only half. The *huntian* model is like a viewed sphere, showing its entirety.\"* Shun’s *jixuan* follows the *huntian* method.\n\nCai Yong’s *Treatise on Astronomy* states: *\"There are three schools of celestial bodies. The first is the *Zhoubi*. It describes heaven as an overturned basin, with the Dipper’s handle at the center, high in the middle and low at the edges, while the sun and moon move around it. When they are near, they are seen as day; when far, they are unseen as night. Though its calculations are detailed, they contain many errors, so the Bureau of Astronomy does not use it.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"Heaven is round like an open umbrella; earth is square like a chessboard. Heaven moves like a turning millstone to the left; the sun and moon move to the right, following heaven’s leftward rotation.\"*",

Their movement and stillness all depend on qi.\" It is also said: \"Heaven stands firm above, possessing a constant and stable form.\" This incorporates elements of the *Gaitian* theory.\n\nLi Chunfeng’s *Gaitian* theory states: \"Heaven and earth are high at the center and low at the four edges. The sun and moon conceal one another, creating day and night as they revolve. The North Pole is always visible as the *upper circle*; the South Pole is always hidden as the *middle circle*; the celestial equator stretches horizontally as the *lower circle*.\"\n\nThe third school is *Huntian*. Ge Hong said: \"Heaven’s shape is like an egg; earth is like its yolk. Earth resides within heaven, heaven large and earth small. Beyond heaven’s surface lies water; heaven and earth each ride upon qi and float, carried by water as they move. Dividing the celestial sphere in half, the lower half covers the earth, while the upper half circles beneath it.\" Song scholar He Chengtian said: \"Heaven’s form is perfectly round, with water occupying half. The east is where the sun rises, called *Yanggu*; the west is where it sets, called *Chengchi*. Zhuangzi spoke of the *Northern and Southern Limits*—this is evidence that water surrounds all four directions, hence the term *Four Seas*. Within the Five Phases, water is born of metal, and all rivers originate from mountains before flowing downward into the sea. The sun is the essence of yang; when it enters water at night, it would scorch and dry up, but the rivers’ return replenishes it. Thus, drought does not cause desiccation, nor does flooding cause overflow.\"\n\nWang Fan also said: \"The sun and moon first ascend into heaven, then descend into earth. The sun is above the earth by day and below it by night.\" Today’s astronomical observatories largely follow this method. Yang Xiong said: \"Luo Xiaheng designed it, Xianyu Wangren measured it, and Geng Zhongcheng modeled it.\" Later Han scholars Cai Yong, Zhang Heng, and Zheng Xuan all regarded *Huntian* as superior.\n\nIn my humble opinion, beyond these there are also the *Xuantian* and *Xintian* theories, but none are worth adopting. Wu scholar Yao Xin said: \"Humans are like spiritual creatures, their forms most resembling heaven. The face tilts forward toward the chest, while the crown does not cover the back. Thus, heaven’s body slopes downward in the south, entering the earth, while the north is higher—this also reveals why humans are noble.\" Ouyang Xiu said: \"The ancients measured the gnomon’s shadow, intending to regulate and harmonize qi to assist the proper timing of things, not to debate the merits of *Huntian* or *Gaitian* models. Whether one holds *Gaitian* or *Huntian*, the south’s degrees gradually narrow, while the north’s pole rises higher. Endless disputes over differences—what benefit do they bring to human ethics and transformation?\"\n\nYet in investigating things, the noble person prioritizes exhausting principles and extending knowledge. It is also said: \"The northwest is high, supporting the heavens’ summit.\" Master Zhang said: \"Yu Xi’s words—'Heaven stands firm above, possessing a constant and stable form'—are all profoundly meaningful. It is only regrettable that he did not explore their beginning and end.\"\n\nThe *Luoshu*’s numbers begin with nine atop and one below. One arises from below, forming *Kan* Water—the inception of heaven’s image. Nine culminates above, forming *Qian* Metal—the completion of heaven’s image. Thus, *Kan* Water is yielding and moves, while *Qian* Metal is firm and congeals. Movement generates pulse and life, while the brain’s essence remains tranquil—this is the North Pole as heaven’s summit, steadfast and unmoving, possessing a constant and stable form, which is also the image of *Gaitian*.\n\nIt is also said: \"Heaven’s yang lies in the south, its yin in the north. Earth’s yin lies in the south, its yang in the north. Heaven’s yang is in the south, hence the sun resides there. Earth’s firmness is in the north, hence mountains reside there. Thus, earth is high in the northwest, heaven high in the southeast. The far south is intensely hot; the far north, intensely cold. Therefore, the south melts while the north congeals—these are the deathly realms of the myriad things. Heaven slopes downward from south to north, yang in the south, yin in the north. Thus, in the *Xiantian* circular diagram, *Qian*’s position is south, *Kun*’s north. Earth slopes downward from north to south, yang in the north, yin in the south. Thus, in the *Xiantian* square diagram, *Qian* is positioned in the northwest, *Kun* in the southeast. When the sun is in the south, it is at meridian; when in the north, it is hidden. Heaven’s south is yang above, hence the far south is intensely hot. What appears on earth melts into water. Though earth has yin, it cannot suppress yang. Heaven’s north is yin above, hence the far north is intensely cold. What appears on earth congeals into mountains. Though earth has yang, it is suppressed by yin. Yang’s nature, when extreme, melts; yin’s nature, when extreme, congeals. Earth’s south should be cold but is low and hot; its north should be hot but is high and cold—this follows heaven. Water is yielding and belongs to yin. As yin cannot overcome yang, it serves yang’s purpose. Mountains are firm and belong to yang. As yang cannot overcome yin, they serve yin’s purpose. Thus, in form, they follow earth’s yielding and firmness; in qi, they follow heaven’s cold and heat. At the extremes of yang and yin, qi is not harmonious. The myriad things do not grow—hence, these are deathly realms. Only where heaven and earth’s cold and heat intermingle and harmonize do the myriad things flourish.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Scholar Hu of Anding said: 'Heaven is the form of *Qian*; *Qian* is heaven’s function. Heaven’s form is azure, with the southern pivot sinking thirty-six degrees below earth and the northern pivot rising thirty-six degrees above it, resembling a leaning pestle. Its function is such that in one day and night, it travels over nine hundred thousand *li*. With each human breath, heaven moves eighty *li*. In one day and night, a person takes over thirteen thousand six hundred breaths.'\"",

Though its calculations are detailed, they contain many errors, so the Bureau of Astronomy does not use it.\"*\n\nIt is also said: *\"Heaven is round like an open umbrella; earth is square like a chessboard. Heaven moves like a turning millstone to the left; the sun and moon move to the right, following heaven’s leftward rotation.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Thus, heaven travels over nine hundred thousand *li* in a day and night. I humbly note: The *Book of Elixirs* states that in one day and night, a person takes thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. One thousand one hundred twenty-five breaths correspond to one *shi* (two-hour period), which would total thirteen thousand five hundred sixty breaths. Master Wending [Hu Hong] cited a round number.\n\nZheng’s commentary on the *Kao Ling Yao* says: The Great Void originally has no form or body; it is only by observing the movement of the stars that we conceive of heaven’s body. Yet the stars’ revolution is from east to west, and after three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days, they return to their original positions. While the stars revolve leftward, the sun moves rightward, also taking three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days to return to its original stellar position. Taking one day’s movement as one *du* (degree), and calculating across the twenty-eight lunar lodges, a full celestial circuit measures nearly three hundred sixty-five and a quarter *du*—this is the measure of heaven’s single revolution. Heaven is like a pellet from a sling, its circumference three hundred sixty-five and a quarter *du*. Each *du* spans two thousand nine hundred thirty-two *li* and three hundred forty-eight parts of one thousand four hundred sixty-one *li*, making the total circumference of heaven one million seventy-one thousand *li*. Speaking of circumference as three times the diameter, the straight diameter of the twenty-eight lodges’ circuit is three hundred fifty-seven thousand *li*. Beyond the twenty-eight lodges, above, below, east, and west each extend fifteen thousand *li*, forming the four extremes of celestial motion, called the Four Limits. Within the Four Limits and the lodges’ interior, the total distance is three hundred eighty-seven thousand *li*. At heaven’s central point, directly above and below, the distance is one hundred ninety-three thousand five hundred *li*. Earth lies at its center—this is the distance from earth to heaven.\n\nIt further states: Earth’s thickness increases by thirty thousand *li*. Wang Fan’s commentary on the *Shangshu* says: Heaven above earth spans one hundred eighty-two and a half *du* and more; the same is true below earth. The North Pole rises thirty-six *du* above earth, with Mount Song directly aligned with heaven’s center. Fifty-five *du* south of the pole lies the summit of Mount Song. Twelve *du* further south is the sun’s path at the Summer Solstice. Another twenty-four *du* south is the sun’s path at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes. Yet another twenty-four *du* south is the Winter Solstice path. Southward, the distance to earth is only thirty-one *du*. Thus, at the Summer Solstice, the sun is sixty-seven *du* from the North Pole; at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes, ninety-one *du*; and at the Winter Solstice, one hundred fifteen *du*. The North and South Poles hold heaven’s two ends, while heaven, the sun, moon, and stars revolve obliquely—this is the general principle. Ancient methods once existed but were lost during the Qin.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Though the celestial sphere encircles earth, earth remains centrally level, while heaven slopes downward to the south. The celestial circuit is divided equally between north and south. The North Pole rises thirty-six *du* above earth, with the rest submerged; the South Pole sinks thirty-six *du* below earth, with the rest visible. Heaven and humanity both face south with their backs to the north, hence the southern sky is seen while the northern is hidden.\n\nHe further said: The celestial circuit encircling the North Pole spans seventy-two *du*, always visible and never concealed—this is called the Upper Rule. The circuit encircling the South Pole spans seventy-two *du*, always hidden and never seen—this is called the Lower Rule. Though the yin realm divides into yin and yang, the constant concealment and visibility belong to the static reckoning, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram’s one hundred forty-four counting rods. The east-west circuit in motion spans two hundred sixteen *du*. Though the yang realm divides into yin and yang, the alternating motion belongs to the dynamic reckoning, corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods. The hexagram represents earth; the lines represent heaven. The *Qian* hexagram’s counting rods total two hundred sixty.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Earth rises and falls; the sun’s path lengthens and shortens. Though earth is a congealed, indissoluble substance, the two qi rise and descend, endlessly following one another. When yang ascends daily, earth descends daily, and what descends becomes empty. When yang descends daily, earth ascends daily, and what ascends becomes full—this is the pattern of the year’s cold and heat.\n\nThe *Kao Ling Yao* states: Earth’s thickness increases by thirty thousand *li*. At the Spring Equinox, earth lies at heaven’s center; from then on, it gradually descends. By the Summer Solstice, earth has sunk fifteen thousand *li*, its upper edge level with heaven’s center. After the Summer Solstice, earth gradually rises. By the Autumn Equinox, it returns to heaven’s center; from then on, it gradually ascends. By the Winter Solstice, it has risen fifteen thousand *li*, its lower edge level with heaven’s center. After the Winter Solstice, it gradually descends—this is earth’s rise and fall within thirty thousand *li*. Heaven moves laterally within the Four Limits: south in winter, north in summer, west in spring, and east in autumn, each time brushing the Four Limits before stopping. Earth likewise rises and falls within heaven: descending at the Winter Solstice and ascending at the Summer Solstice, with the two solstices marking the extremes of earth’s thickness.\n\nThe *Kao Ling Yao* further states: In the first month, the sun is eight thousand *li* above and one hundred four thousand *li* below—hence the terms \"above\" and \"below.\" Zheng’s commentary says: Heaven is one hundred ninety-three thousand five hundred *li* from earth. At the Rain Water solar term in the first month, the sun is above, eight thousand *li* from heaven, and one hundred thirteen thousand five hundred *li* from earth. At the Summer Solstice, the sun reaches its highest point, level with heaven’s edge, then gradually descends. By the Winter Solstice, the sun is eight thousand *li* from earth and one hundred thirteen thousand five hundred *li* from heaven.\n\nAs detailed in the *Kao Ling Yao* commentary: The twenty-eight lodges and all stars revolve leftward with heaven, completing one celestial circuit each day and night.",

      "translated_text": "Beyond one celestial circuit, the heavens advance by one degree, totaling three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter circuits in a year. The sun, moon, and five planets, however, move rightward. The sun travels one degree per day, while the moon advances thirteen and seven-nineteenths degrees daily. These are the harmonized reckonings.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Heaven and earth drift in four directions, ascending and descending no more than thirty thousand *li*. The *Rites of Zhou* states that a one-*cun* shadow on the earthen gnomon corresponds to one thousand *li*. A shadow of one *chi* and five *cun* thus corresponds to fifteen thousand *li*. Since this measurement is taken at the center of the earth, the distances from north to south and east to west are each thirty thousand *li*—not that the space between heaven and earth is limited to this span. In spring, the earth drifts three thousand *li* past the east; in summer, three thousand *li* past the south; and likewise in autumn to the west and in winter to the north. Imagine a great basin filled with water, with an empty vessel floating at its center, marking the four directions. If the vessel drifts three *cun* eastward—where one *cun* equals ten thousand *li*—then it recedes three *cun* from the west. Just as the earth is deeper than the water, when it tilts three thousand *li* past the east, it withdraws three thousand *li* from the west. The same applies to north and south. Thus, the varying lengths of day and night in winter and summer are not caused by the gnomon’s shadow or the sun’s rising and setting, but rather by the earth’s cyclical drift through the four directions.\n\nSomeone asks: There is no such principle. Though it cannot be known for certain, the calculations of astronomers all align with this reckoning. Perhaps such a principle exists. Both the earth and the stars undergo fourfold drifting and ascending-descending. The fourfold drift begins at the *Lichun* solar term, when the earth and stars drift westward. At the *Chunfen* solar term, the westward drift reaches its extreme, though the earth’s ascent and descent remain centered. From there, it gradually drifts eastward until the end of spring, when it returns to its original position. After *Lixia*, it drifts northward; at the *Xiazhi* solar term, the northward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent reach their lowest point. By the end of summer, it returns to center. After *Liqiu*, it drifts eastward; at the *Qiufen* solar term, the eastward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent return to center. By the end of autumn, it is restored. After *Lidong*, it drifts southward; at the *Dongzhi* solar term, the southward drift reaches its extreme, and the earth’s ascent and descent reach their highest point. By the end of winter, it returns to center. This is the meaning of the earth’s and stars’ fourfold drift. The stars also rise and fall with the earth, never exceeding the thirty thousand *li* range. Halving this gives fifteen thousand *li*, matching the one *chi* and five *cun* of the earthen gnomon. A one-*chi* discrepancy corresponds to ten thousand *li*, while five *cun* correspond to five thousand *li*. A one-*fen* difference equals one hundred *li*. Thus, the lengthening and shortening of shadows all differ by one *cun*. Therefore, the royal domain of a thousand *li* takes its model from the sun. One *cun* is set as the standard, and when the sun is observed at its fullest, its breadth of one *chi* corresponds to a thousand *li*.\n\nSomeone asks: The theory of fourfold drift is baseless and unorthodox. Thus, the *Erya* commentary does not follow Zheng’s annotation. I say: Amidst the confusion of many voices, one need only consult the sacred classics and worthy traditions to resolve it. Now, both Master Zhang and Master Zhu have affirmed this theory—there is no cause for doubt.",

      "translated_text": "Someone asks: Master Zhu said: *The Rites of Zhou* employs the method of the earthen gnomon to measure the depth of the soil, align the sun’s shadow, and determine the center of the land. When the sun is in the south, shadows lengthen and cold increases; when in the east, evening shadows bring frequent winds; when in the west, morning shadows bring much overcast.\n\nAnother asks: Zheng’s commentary states: “Evening shadows” refer to the moment when the sun’s reflection aligns the shadow. The gnomon is placed too far east, near the sun. “Morning shadows” refer to the moment before noon when the shadow aligns. The gnomon is placed too far west, distant from the sun.\n\nMaster Zhu replied: “Evening shadows bring frequent winds; morning shadows bring much overcast.” These two lines in Zheng’s commentary cannot be dismissed, though his explanation is inverted. It appears that “evening shadows” occur when the shadow aligns late. Before noon, the shadow has already aligned. If the gnomon is placed too far south, the sun is nearer, making shadows shorter before noon and longer after. “Morning shadows” occur when the sun has already passed noon, yet the shadow has not yet aligned. If the gnomon is placed too far north, the sun is more distant, making shadows longer before noon and shorter after.\n\nAsked about the prevalence of wind and overcast: He said: The east is naturally windy, as seen in coastal prefectures where winds are extreme. They arrive as expected—spring brings east winds, summer brings south winds. Open land without mountains to obstruct them allows winds to arrive from their respective directions. Wind arises from the waxing and waning of yang qi: it stirs at dawn as yang ascends, peaks at noon, weakens in the afternoon, and ceases by evening. As for the west’s frequent overcast, it is not merely due to high mountains blocking the sky—yang qi naturally declines there. When the sun reaches its zenith there, it is already late in that region, and soon it sets, so the western lands seldom see the sun. The ancients said: “In Shu, the sun melts snow”; they also called it “the leaking sky,” for the sun is rarely seen. Observing heaven and earth thus, one sees they are not so vast. This can be verified through the sun, moon, cold, heat, wind, and overcast.\n\nTang scholar Jia Gongyan said: When the Duke of Zhou established Luoyang, he sought the land’s center and erected five gnomons. The central gnomon was placed in Yangcheng, Yingchuan. The site where shadows were measured still bears ancient traces.

Zheng Kangcheng also erred in assuming the gnomon’s length was used to measure qi. It was made of jade, one *chi* long and one *cun* wide. A gnomon was sought where the shadow’s length, measured by the jade gnomon, matched one *chi* and five *cun*—this was the land’s center. If the shadow lengthened, the gnomon’s shadow shortened; if the shadow shortened, the gnomon’s shadow lengthened. At the winter solstice, the gnomon’s shadow extended over thirteen *chi*. Now, the land’s center differs from ancient times.",

      "translated_text": "The city of Hanyang was deemed the center of the earth; the Yue Terrace of the Song dynasty was likewise considered the center; today, it lies in Xunyi, the old Kaifeng County.\n\nIn the twelfth year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang, envoys were dispatched throughout the realm. They observed the sun’s shadow from Linyi in the south to Hengye in the north, and determined that the Yue Terrace in Xunyi stood at the midpoint between the northern and southern arcs, thus marking the earth’s center. When the Great Zhou established its capital at Bian, it erected a jade gnomon and placed an arrow to measure the Yue Terrace. When the shadow’s length aligned with the center of the graduated scale, the solstice arrived, and the qi responded accordingly.\n\nLu Xiangshan said: A vessel of bronze served as the clepsydra, and a floating arrow marked the divisions. The day comprises twelve earthly branches, eight celestial stems, and the four cardinal directions; the year, twelve months and twenty-four solar terms. By measuring the sun’s shadow with a jade gnomon and discerning directions with a lodestone, the twenty-four positions were thus rectified. As the sun’s path shifts north and south, day and night vary in length, and so twenty-one arrows were established. South of the Yue Terrace, three relocations were made, rendering six arrows unusable; north of the Yue Terrace, three relocations were likewise made, and six arrows were also discarded due to the stems and branches. Occasionally, the shadow fell ahead or behind, or straddled two positions where the lodestone pointed—some took it as the third division of *chén* or the seventh of *bǐng*, others as the midpoint between *bǐng* and *wǔ*—yet there remained a fixed principle. Since the time of the Duke of Zhou, this method of correlating yin and yang has persisted, and scholars ought to heed it.\n\nHe further stated: Heaven envelops earth, and the heaven of earth moves within the earth’s center. Zhang Hengqu said: Earth, in relation to heaven, is but a single object within it—nothing more. Thus, the One vast and great is called heaven; the Two, small, is called earth.\n\nHe also said: The body of heaven is high in the north and low in the south, while the body of earth lies level within it. Shaozi remarked: Heaven covers earth, and earth bears heaven. Above heaven lies earth, and above earth lies heaven—yet men dwelling on earth perceive it not.\n\nHe further said: Heaven is round like a ball of qi, with earth slanting across its midst. Heaven’s expanse is boundless, yet the void within is finite. Like a hollow sphere in space, viewed from within, one faces east while the sphere turns west, and heaven rotates leftward. Yet the stars and the Pole share a single aspect, while the Four Movements press against the four limits and halt. Observing the *Xiantian Diagram*, from *Lin* upward, each set of sixteen hexagrams represents the heaven of heaven and the heaven of earth, encompassing the reckonings of *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* within heaven. From *Tongren* and *Dun* downward, each set of sixteen hexagrams represents the earth of heaven and the earth of earth, encompassing the reckonings of years, months, days, and hours within earth.\n\nHe also said: The positions on earth remain fixed and unchanging, while the celestial images revolve without cease. Only when the *Chunhuo* of heaven aligns with the *wǔ* position of earth do they converge, attaining the proper motion of heaven.\n\nZhu Xi said: In heaven, the twelve conjunctions are called *chén*. In the eleventh month, the *chén* resides in *Xingji*; in the twelfth month, in *Xuangan*; in the first month, in *Zouzi*; in the second month, in *Jianglou*—and so forth. If viewed from earth, standing facing south, the four directions and twelve *chén* positions likewise correspond, fixed and unchanging. Thus, the celestial sphere spans 365¼ degrees, with the twenty-eight lunar lodges arrayed to manifest the body of heaven and define the four directions. As heaven encircles earth, in one day and night it completes a full revolution, advancing by one degree. The sun, moon, and five planets likewise revolve around earth with heaven. Yet only the sun’s motion completes one circuit each day, neither exceeding nor falling short; the others vary in speed. Though suspended, they are neither affixed nor propelled, but rather, where their qi is abundant, their spirit naturally flourishes, each following its own order.\n\nHe further said: Heaven is deficient in the northwest, and earth incomplete in the southeast. Thus, the southeast abounds in water, while the northwest teems with mountains. The *Suwen* commentary states: The terrain of the Central Plains is high in the northwest and low in the southeast. The *Hetu Kuodi Xiang* says: The northwest is the Gate of Heaven, the southeast the Door of Earth. The Gate of Heaven has no above, the Door of Earth no below. Heaven descends from above to enter ten thousand *li*.\n\nHe also said: South of the sun’s zenith lies fifteen thousand *li*. Measured from the earth’s center, north and south, east and west each span thirty thousand *li*. Earlier scholars observed: The mountains and rivers of the Central Plains all originate in the northwest. Thus, those who describe mountains and rivers begin in the northwest and proceed southeast. Mountains and rivers on earth are like blood vessels in man—some lie close yet unconnected, while others distant are linked. Hence it is said: How could the Yangtze and seas sever the earth’s veins?\n\nCai Shi said: The great Yellow River and the northern mountains—all their roots and ridges stem from Dai in the north. The mountains of Wutai and Xian rise from lofty heights. The waters west of the ridge flow westward into the upper reaches of the Yellow River beyond Longmen. Those east of the ridge flow eastward as the Sanggan, forming the rivers of You and Ji, and empty into the sea. One western branch becomes the Kongkou Great Range; the next branch encircles the northern banks of Fen and Jin; another becomes the Taihang; yet another, the Hengshan—these form the northern range. The southern range comprises the mountains and rivers south of the Yangtze and Han. The veins of Mount Min divide: one northern branch becomes Mount Heng, ending west of Dongting; the southern branch crosses the Gui Range, passes north through the lands of Yuan and Jun, and reaches De’an, where it is called *Fuqian Plain*—some say it is today’s Lushan in Jiangzhou. Between these two branches, the Xiang River interrupts the connection. Mount Heng lies southeast of the Xiang, while *Fuqian Plain* lies northeast.",

      "translated_text": "The origins and flows of these mountains and rivers may be traced. Master Zheng takes Mount Yan and Mount Qi as the true northern range, listing the regions through which the Yellow and Ji Rivers pass. Mount Xiqing forms the northernmost range, listing the regions through which the Yi, Luo, Huai, and Wei Rivers flow. Mount Fan Zhong serves as the secondary southern range, listing the regions through which the Han River flows. The Min River marks the true southern range, listing the regions through which the Yangtze flows.\n\nThe *Records of the Western Regions* states: The Yellow River has two sources. One emerges from the Congling Range; the other from Khotan, where two rivers converge and flow eastward into Lop Nur—also called the Salt Marsh—over three hundred *li* from the Yumen and Yang Passes. Its waters remain constant through winter and summer, flowing hidden beneath the earth before reemerging south at Jishi. Master Cheng says: Before the Nine Rivers were submerged by the sea, the land extended five hundred *li* northeast from the present coastline. The Yellow River branched into nine channels, entering the sea near Jieshi, which lay on the northwestern shore. Today, in the lands of Yan and Ji, no such stone remains, yet due south of Pingzhou, a mountain called Mashi stands in the sea, over five hundred *li* from the shore—this is precisely where the ancient Yellow River vanished into the sea. Wang Heng of the Han said: Once, the heavens sent continuous rain and a northeast wind, causing the sea to overflow and flood hundreds of *li* southwest. Thus, the Nine Rivers and Jieshi were engulfed by the sea. Later scholars sought the Nine Rivers on flat land but failed to verify the existence of Jieshi, leading to conflicting accounts and no resolution.\n\nThe *Tang Fa Xiang Zhi* states that the celestial patterns of the world’s mountains and rivers reside in the Two Boundaries. The Northern Boundary begins at Sanwei and Jishi, supporting the northern network of the Zhongnan Range, extending to Huimo and Chaoxian—this is called the Northern Ridge, by which Heaven restrains the Rong and Di. The Southern Boundary begins at Mount Min and Fan Zhong, supporting the southern network, extending to Dong’ou and Minzhong—this is called the Southern Ridge, by which Heaven restrains the Man and Yi.\n\nThe *River Sources* says: The Northern River flows from the head of the Northern Ridge to Huayin, where it meets the earth’s network. It then divides and flows eastward, with the Jing, Wei, Ji, and Zi Rivers forming its outer and inner courses. The *Yangtze Sources* says: The Southern River flows from the head of the Southern Ridge to Huayang, where it meets the earth’s network. At Mount Jing, it divides and flows eastward, with the Han River, Huai River, and Zi River forming its outer and inner courses. Observing the patterns of the Two Rivers and the beginning and end of the Milky Way, the celestial divisions become clear.\n\nThe Southern and Northern Boundaries are how Heaven demarcates the lands of the Central Hua. The Southern and Northern Rivers serve as the warp and weft to the mountains of the Two Boundaries. Within them, the states where civil and martial arts flourish, where commerce and resources abound, all nurture the people, complete the work of creation, and establish the realm of Chinese sovereigns, ministers, fathers, sons, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music. In the universe, nothing is greater than Heaven, nothing deeper than Earth, and nothing more abundant than water. The essence of water rises as the Milky Way and flows downward as the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The moon’s reflection mirrors the forms of mountains and rivers, and water contains the patterns of the stars—all are the creations of a single *qi*. Recognizing the veins of mountains and rivers within the Two Boundaries, discerning the rise and fall of the Dipper and Net in the four directions, and correlating them with the ancient Han commanderies and kingdoms, the divisions of celestial regions become as clear as the lines on one’s palm—such is the grand pattern of mountains and rivers.\n\nIn terms of celestial correspondences, the Northern Boundary aligns with the Ximu constellation, while the Southern Boundary aligns with Xingji. As for the Quail’s Head, which governs the regions of Qin and Long, the heads of the Two Boundary mountains and rivers truly reside there. The ruler who harmoniously receives the pure and refined *qi* of the Central States, who grasps the celestial and terrestrial symbols of the Five Thearchs, and who governs the constant principles of the cosmic order may do so.\n\nThe Milky Way, extending from *kun* to *gen*, serves as the Earth’s network. The Northern Dipper, spanning from *qian* to *xun*, serves as the Heaven’s guiding principle. Their celestial divisions correspond to the regions of the Five Thearchs. *Kun* represents Earth, and the Milky Way is Earth’s *qi*. *Qian* represents Heaven, and the Northern Dipper is Heaven’s pole.\n\nThe Five Thearchs are: Shaohao of the Metal Virtue, Zhuanxu of the Water Virtue, Fuxi the Great Taihao of the Wood Virtue, Shennong the Lie Shan Clan of the Fire Virtue, and the Yellow Emperor of the Youxiong Clan of the Earth Virtue. Each of the Five Thearchs resides in one of the five directions, and their governance is said to revolve around the Xianchi.\n\nWhen governance resides in *qian* within the inner quadrant, it is Jiang Lou, corresponding to Shaohao, with its domain at the Northern Palace. When governance resides in *qian* within the outer quadrant, it is Zou Zi, corresponding to Zhuanxu, with its domain at Sheti. When governance resides in *xun* within the inner quadrant, it is Shouxing, corresponding to Taihao, with its domain at Taiwei. When governance resides in *xun* within the outer quadrant, it is Chun Wei, corresponding to the Lie Shan Clan, with its domain encompassing the Four Seas. The central pillar of governance is Xuanyuan, corresponding to the Yellow Emperor, with its domain at the handle of the Dipper governing externally. Chun Wei governs the southern maritime states, while the Dipper’s bowl governs internally. Zou Zi governs the central states surrounded by conflict. The remaining constellations: eight lie on the yin side of the Milky Way, governing maritime states; four lie on the yang side, governing states surrounded by conflict.\n\nThe world’s mountains divide into four ranges, corresponding to the twenty-eight constellations. The first range includes Mount Yan, Mount Qi, Hukou, Mount Leishou, Mount Taiyue, and Dizhu—these are the eastern constellations. Next are Jiang Lou and Xugan, supporting the Eastern Sea. The spirit of Mount Tai presides, called Jupiter.\n\nThe second range includes Mount Xicheng, Mount Wangwu, Mount Taihang, Mount Heng, Mashi, Mount Xiqing, and Zhu Yu—these are the northern constellations. Next are Daliang and Ximu, supporting the Northern Sea. The spirit of Mount Heng presides, called Mercury.\n\nThe third range includes Mount Wushu, Mount Taihua, Mount Xiong’er, Mount Waifang, Mount Tongbai, Mount Fan Zhong, and Pei Wei—these are the western constellations. Next are Chun Shou and Shi Shen, supporting the Western Sea. The spirit of Mount Hua presides, called Venus.\n\nThe fourth range includes Mount Jing, Mount Neifang, Mount Dabie, Mount Min, Mount Heng, the Nine Rivers, and Fuqian Plain—these are the southern constellations.",

West of Shan lies Qin and Liang. The northern bend of mountains and rivers marks the land of Jin, while the southern bend marks Ba and Shu—these are lands where culture and strategy contend.\n\nEast of Shan, the Three Rivers converge, with the Central Peak forming Chengzhou. To the west, it extends to Waifang and Mount Da Ren; to the north, it crosses the Ji and reaches south of the Huai; to the east, it stretches to Ju Ye—these are the lands of Song, Zheng, Chen, and Cai. North of the Yellow River and south of the Ji lie Yu, Wei, and Di. East along the Huaiyin lies Shen and Sui—these are lands where commerce and wealth flourish.\n\nThe northern bend extends east to the Northern River, where north lies Xing and Zhao. The southern bend extends east to the Southern River, where south lies Jing and Chu. Downstream from the Northern River, south to Mount Tai, lies the land of Qi; flanking Ma Shi to the right lies northern Yan. Downstream from the Southern River, north to Mount Tai, lies Zou and Lu; south across the Jiang and Huai lies Wu and Yue—these are the lands bordering the sea.\n\nOther features, such as the nine strategic passes, the nine bends of the Yellow River, the nurturing waters of Sanwei, the nine twists of the Min River, all correspond to the constellations above.\n\nThe *He Luo* chapter states: \"The central star of the celestial pole is the dwelling of Kunlun. The Heavenly Gate and Bright Hall are the essence of Mount Tai.\"\n\nZhang Heng said: \"In heaven, images take form; on earth, shapes manifest. Heaven has nine positions; earth has nine domains. Heaven has three luminaries; earth has three terrains—all can be pointed to and spoken of.\"\n\nIf one pursues this to its utmost, the eight extremities span a diameter of 220,2300 li. The distance from north to south is shorter by a thousand li, while east to west is broader by a thousand li. From earth to heaven is half the span of the eight extremities, and the depth of the earth is the same. Measuring this comprehensively, the calculations employ the double-gougu method: the shadow of the suspended heaven and the principle of the earth’s surface both shift by one cun for every thousand li. Beyond this, what lies further remains unknown. What remains unknown is called the cosmos. The bounds of space are infinite; the origins of time are without end—inexhaustible and unknowable.\n\nI have examined the realms above and below, consulting ancient records, and provisionally speak of the lands under the rule of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as measured by the steps of Da Zhang and Kui Hai. Confucius described these lands as: \"North to Youling, south to Jiaozhi, west treading the Flowing Sands, east reaching the Coiling Tree.\" Heaven and earth converge, and the finest qi gathers. The Yellow River reveals its numinous power, and the *River Chart* and *Luo Writ* emerge. Thus, the most refined of humanity become sages, and the Zhou and Confucius arose as the masters of China’s rites, music, and civilization, inheriting the legacy of Fuxi and the host of sages.\n\nZou and Lu abound in refined scholars; Yan and Zhao teem with heroes. East and west of the mountains, generals and ministers arise—all working together to weave the fabric of the Central States.\n\nYu inherited the prosperity of Yao and Shun, pacifying the Nine Provinces, and the jade and silk of ten thousand states were settled. The arable land totaled 9,108,024 qing. The lands rising above water spanned 8,000 li; the lands receiving water spanned 8,000 li. Famous mountains numbered 5,350, extending 64,050 li. Copper-producing mountains numbered 467; iron-producing mountains numbered 3,609. Commerce thrived through men plowing and women weaving. By not encroaching on their time, wealth and resources were ensured. Frugality left surplus; extravagance brought insufficiency. The public treasury held thirty years’ reserves; private households stored nine years’ provisions.\n\nAt the height of Chengzhou’s prosperity, the population numbered 22,704,923—161,000 more than in Yu’s time. Thereafter, through the Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties, abundance and scarcity fluctuated. To the present day, the realm is unified, surpassing the primordial chaos to merge the subtle and indistinct, reaching the limits of heaven and earth. None fail to revere and cherish it, allowing one to trace the footsteps of the Three August Ones and Five Emperors.\n\nZhu Xi said: \"The *River Chart* speaks of Kunlun as the center of the earth. Beneath the earth lie eight pillars, mutually restraining one another. Famous mountains and great rivers, with their caverns and channels, are interconnected.\"\n\nThe *Commentary on Sima Xiangru’s Biography* states: \"Kunlun Mountain lies 50,000 li from China, spanning 10,000 li in breadth and height, rising 80,000 ren. Its layered cities have nine tiers, with nine wells on each face, jade railings, and five gates on the sides—it is the lower capital of the Celestial Emperor.\"\n\nThe *Water Classic* says: \"Kunlun lies 50,000 li from China, and the mountain itself spans 11,000 li.\"\n\nHu Yongzhi asked: \"Where does Tianzhu lie? Its lands produce many extraordinary people.\"\n\nZhu Xi replied: \"China lies 20,000 li from Yutian, and Yutian is another 30,000 li from Kunlun without further barriers.\"\n\nThe *Wenchang Miscellany* records that envoys from Yutian came to pay tribute, stating that 1,300 li west of their country lay Kunlun Mountain. Thus, China lies to the southeast of Kunlun, while the lands of Tianzhu lie directly to its south. The Yellow River flows from the southeast of Kunlun into China. In this way, Kunlun lies to the southwest of Tianzhu.\n\nThe *Qian Book* states: \"Mount Aru is Kunlun. At its summit lies the great Aru Pool, whose waters divide and flow in four directions. The stream entering China becomes the Yellow River, flowing into the Eastern Sea. The other three streams each enter the Southern, Western, and Northern Seas, like the Weak Waters and Black Waters.\"\n\nGenerally, the earth’s shape resembles a steamed bun, with its pointed tip being Kunlun. China’s terrain is perfectly round, and the people born there are likewise round and upright in form. Its geography benefits from the central qi of heaven and earth. Other worlds are shaped with slanted, pointed, or incomplete forms, encircling it externally, lacking the uprightness of heaven and earth. The people born there are often likewise unbalanced.",

      "translated_text": "This is the theory of the beneficent heavens. Master Hengqu also subscribed to this view, stating:\n\nAncient records say: \"The northwest abounds in mountains, with Kunlun as their ancestral root. Its ridge spans the cosmos, and the Five Peaks and Three Crossings stretch across it in interlocking grandeur.\" It is also said: \"The Yellow River issues from Kunlun, the highest point on earth. Looking northward toward the sandy lands, no natural barriers obstruct the view. Should waters breach their bounds to the east and west, flooding would easily ensue. Yu dredged the Nine Rivers to temper their surging waves.\"\n\nIt further states: \"Mount Song is not the center of heaven but the center of earth. The Yellow Path and Red Path both lie north of Mount Song. The Southern and Northern Poles are the pivots of heaven. Only this place remains unmoving, like the navel of a millstone. This is the central point of heaven.\"\n\nAccording to Master Shao: \"The origin of heaven and earth—does it not arise from the center? Where is the center of heaven? It is at the Celestial Pole. Where is the center of earth? It is at Mount Song. Only with the Celestial Pole as heaven’s center can calendrical calculations and seasonal divisions be derived. Only with Mount Song as earth’s center can directions be fixed and distances measured. Is not the *zi-wu* axis the center of heaven and earth?\n\nAt the winter solstice, yang is born at midnight, and half an hour past midnight marks the *zi* hour. Thus, *Qian* begins in *Kan* and ends in *Li*—this is why the Southern and Northern Poles alone serve as heaven’s pivot, unmoving. At the summer solstice, yin is born at noon, when the sun stands at the zenith. Thus, *Kun* begins in *Li* and ends in *Kan*—this is why the Yellow Path and Red Path also lie north of Mount Song, unwavering.\n\nOnly the central point of heaven and earth remains eternally fixed, and thus the sages emerge. They observe the great movements from the pivot of the celestial sphere, establish key principles to examine future trends, and derive all calculations from this foundation.\"\n\nSomeone once asked me: \"Can your *Xuanhun* chapter fully encompass the structure of heaven and earth?\" I replied: \"No. For celestial patterns, there are astronomers and historians; for geography, there are maps like the *Fingertip Atlas*; for the correspondence of clouds and stars to regions, there is Tang Yixing; for the twists and turns of waterways, there is Li Daoyuan.

      "translated_text": "**Section Two**\n\nMaster Kong of the Tang said: \"Yin (陰) means 'shade'—yin qi resides within, concealed and sheltering. Yang (陽) means 'radiance'—yang qi extends outward, flourishing and manifest. Yang, as the odd, is qi; qi blends into oneness as chaos. It also becomes the sun, whose body is ever luminous, without waxing or waning. Yin, as the even, is form; form divides into self and other. It also becomes the moon, with its phases of darkness and renewal. Fuxi observed the numbers of yin and yang and drew one unbroken line to symbolize yang, one broken line to symbolize yin. Yang is singular and bestows; yin is dual and receives—yet both arise from the same qi. When active, it is yang; when receding, it is yin—these two are but one. When yang arrives, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. The life and death of the myriad things are governed by yang, thus all returns to the One.\n\nNow, heaven and earth were formed from the primordial splitting of yin and yang qi, establishing the great foundation as their master—this is the uncarved block. Then they became father and mother, giving birth to humans and creatures, undergoing endless transformations, branching into countless threads—yet none escape this origin. Thus, filling the cosmos, what is there that is not the qi of yin and yang? All things are bound to these two principles.\n\nAt the dawn of creation, form was shaped from qi, so yin and yang gave rise to heaven and earth. With form as the vessel for qi, heaven and earth in turn generate yin and yang. Dong Zhongshu of the Han first expounded yin and yang, becoming the model for Confucians. Confucians cannot be ignorant of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhou said: 'Water, though yin, is rooted in yang, for it arises from the One. Fire, though yang, is rooted in yin, for it arises from the Two.' Thus, Master Zhang said: 'The essence of yin and yang dwells within each other’s abode.'\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Master Zhou’s work revolves around the two poles of yin and yang. At the beginning lies the principle of ceaseless generation; at the end, the principle of settled order. Where generation occurs, life is spoken of; where order is fixed, death is spoken of. Before the Supreme Polarity (Taiji) divided, yin contained yang. After the Supreme Polarity divided, yang separated from yin. Yang submerged in yin becomes water; yin submerged in yang becomes fire.'\n\nMaster Zhang said: 'Qi, vast and boundless in the great void, rises and falls, soars and swirls, never ceasing. Here lies the mechanism of emptiness and fullness, movement and stillness—the origin of yin and yang, hardness and softness. That which floats upward is the essence of yang; that which sinks downward is the turbidity of yin. Their encounters and congealments become wind and rain, frost and snow. The fusion and solidification of mountains and rivers, the dregs and embers—all are teachings. Wandering qi, chaotic and intertwined, coalesces into substance, giving rise to the myriad distinct beings. The ceaseless cycling of yin and yang’s two poles establishes the great principle of heaven and earth.'\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Observe wandering qi horizontally; observe yin and yang vertically. Yin and yang are like a fan; wandering qi is like the wind it produces. Yin and yang are like a millstone; wandering qi is like the flour it grinds. Yin and yang are like the root of a tree; wandering qi is like its blossoms and fruit. There is no wandering qi apart from yin and yang. The void is qi—able to rise and fall, soar and swirl to generate the myriad things, though people do not see it. Like the five-colored dragon qi seen from afar, qi scatters forth, containing both essence and excess, thus beings possess bias and uprightness. Their encounters and congealments—above, this speaks of the two qi; below, it speaks of wandering qi. The character *shi* (始, beginning) here refers to the mother of all things. The refined all emerge from the excess. In the affairs of excess, there is nothing that is not the Dao of heaven—thus it is the supreme teaching.\n\nThe two qi within heaven and earth ceaselessly revolve, unconsciously giving rise to countless beings. Each obtains a nature and life, each possesses a form and substance—all formed from the convergence of this qi. Though this is so, the two poles of yin and yang, emerging in great swaths, remain unchanged.\n\nHe also said: 'No two things created by the Maker are alike. Though the myriad things are many, there is not one without yin and yang.' From this, we know that the transformations of heaven and earth arise from these two poles alone. Observe the sun and moon, male and female, yin and yang—if you see that not a single thing lacks yin and yang, even the most minute being has a front and back. If one speaks of movement, it is all one qi.\n\nThus, Master Zhu said: 'Yang alone cannot generate; yin alone cannot complete. The ceaseless flow of creation requires their joint operation. Like east and west, south and north standing together, their positions oppose. It is simply movement opposing stillness, bending opposing extension, one opposing two, the Dao opposing the vessel. There is back and front, above and below, center and periphery—no thing exists without opposition. Form casts a shadow; sound produces an echo.'\n\nCai Yuanyuan said: 'When beings are born, yin is still and yang is dynamic. The still often resides in seclusion; the dynamic constantly comes and goes. That which comes is *xi* (息, breath); breath is yang. That which goes is *xiao* (消, dissipation); yang dissipates into yin. Between dissipation and breath, transformations occur according to the proportion of yin and yang—this is the flowing yin and yang. After forms take shape, there are heaven and earth, sun and moon, male and female, yin and yang—these are the yin and yang of correspondence. In flowing yin and yang, only yang is active. In corresponding yin and yang, their functions are equal. Though their functions are equal, what is called yin here is not the yin of flow. Thus, even the slightest movement or growth in plants and creatures, though yin, depends on yang to arise. Only withered wood and dead ashes are purely yin.'\n\nHe also said: 'If the Two do not stand, the One cannot be seen. If the One cannot be seen, the function of the Two ceases.' And: 'The One gives rise to spirit; the Two give rise to transformation.' The Two are the waxing and waning, advancing and retreating of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Master Zhang’s words here are exceedingly precise. Without the One, the waxing and waning of yin and yang would have no means of manifestation.'\"",

      "translated_text": "Without the waxing and waning of yin and yang, the One likewise cannot be seen. For yang does not stand alone—it necessarily attains its establishment through yin. Thus, yang takes yin as its foundation, while yin cannot manifest itself except by awaiting yang. Therefore, yin takes yang as its counterpart. Every movement and stillness, every advance and retreat, every cold and heat—all are the workings of yin and yang. Yet there is no agent acting upon them, nor is there a principle of two standing independently. Either yin prevails over yang, or yang prevails over yin. There is nothing that is not so, no time that is not so. Yin and yang are but a single ebb and flow: when advancing, it is called yang; when retreating, it is called yin. Yang’s retreat is yin’s arising—not that yang retreats and then some other yin arises. Viewing yin and yang as one is permissible, as is viewing them as two. In general, generation is always the work of a single yang. As yang grows by one part, yin arises by one part beneath it—not that when yang wanes, one seeks out yin to replace it. Thus, yang’s return is *fu* (復), the original state of things, while yin’s arising is *gou* (垢), a chance encounter. Yin and yang are the yin and yang within yang. When speaking of qi, yin and yang are primary; when speaking of hardness and softness, they are the yin and yang within form. Here, a thing is discernible as either hard or soft.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"At the juncture of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, there is no abrupt division, yet the principle of separation remains. Their ascending and descending, their life and death—these great distinctions cannot be absent.\" He also said: \"The movement of yin and yang—its rising and falling, its fullness and contraction—never ceases for even a moment. Yang is ever full, yin ever deficient. The slightest imbalance gives rise to ten thousand changes. It is like a turning millstone: though its teeth are uneven, once set in motion, endless variations emerge.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Yin and yang are the root of creation and cannot be without each other. Their waxing and waning follow a constant pattern, beyond human alteration. Yet yang governs life, yin governs death, and thus their categories admit distinctions of good and ill. In the *Yi*, the Sage, addressing their inseparability, clarifies them through attributes like strength and compliance, benevolence and righteousness, without partiality. But at the juncture of their waxing and waning, where good and ill diverge, he never fails to express his intent to uphold yang and suppress yin. Speaking of the natural qi of Heaven and Earth, they cannot be without each other. But speaking of the symbols of the noble and the petty, one would wish the world to be entirely noble, without a single petty man. When framed in terms of good and evil, as in *‘Treading on frost, solid ice arrives,’* the arising of a single yin is like the emergence of a thief. Yang is good, yin is evil; the noble and the petty, Heavenly principle and human desire—these contend in victory and defeat.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Why compare yin to the petty man? Viewed in isolation, it seems fine. But by category, though its outward form may be flawed, its essence remains sound.\" Master Yi Chuan said: \"The tenth month is called the yang month—one might doubt whether yang is present, yet yin is the same.\" The Sage did not speak of it thus. Cai Jitong disagreed, saying: \"Yin cannot contend with yang, just as Earth cannot match Heaven.\" Master Zhu remarked that the reason the Sage did not speak of it was that this itself reveals the Way of assisting and completing. For to restrain yin and advance yang, to foster the good and diminish the evil, to employ the noble and dismiss the petty—this is clearly evident. When yang transforms into yin, it is like a gradual shrinking away without a trace, hence it is called *transformation*. When yin transforms into yang, its momentum gradually grows, becoming more distinct, hence it is called *change*. When yin is less than yang, in qi, principle, and number, whether used wholly or partially, the difference lies here.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Yang is the function of the Dao; yin is the substance of the Dao. Yang employs yin, yin employs yang. When yang is taken as function, yin is honored; when yin is taken as function, yang is honored.\" Master Zhang said: \"Yang moves, yin is still; yang is noble, yin is base. Yin can never be spoken of on equal terms with yang. Yet when adapting to time and change, yang contains yin, yin contains yang, and they alternate in function. When yang is exhausted and yin is pure, Kun prevails; when yin is exhausted and yang is pure, Qian prevails.\"\n\nI say: In the *zi* month, the *si* month honors yang; in the *wu* month, the *hai* month honors yin. In terms of division, Qian is noble and Kun is base—they cannot be equated. In terms of the family, though father and mother are both honored, the mother can never be equated with the father, for there is no second supremacy. Master Cai said: \"Yang is not complete without yin, yin does not arise without yang, and yin and yang further rely on each other for function. Yet in qi, yang is the function, hence yang moves and yin is still. In form, yin is the function, hence yin is swift and yang is relaxed.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"When the Supreme Polarity divides, it is merely two yin and yang, which encompass all things under Heaven. The *Yi* does not depart from yin and yang; its thousand changes and ten thousand transformations are but these two. When yin qi flows, it becomes yang; when yang qi flows, it becomes yin. This single qi, in its waxing and waning, advancing and retreating, produces the boundless affairs of Heaven and Earth from ancient times to the present. Take day and night, cold and heat: one is horizontal, one is vertical. Viewed horizontally, the principle is uniform—left is yang, right is yin; front is yang, back is yin; facing is yang, turning away is yin; advancing is yang, retreating is yin; east and south are yang, west and north are yin; spring and summer are yang, autumn and winter are yin—all follow the same pattern. Viewed vertically, the principle is likewise uniform—above is yang, below is yin; facing upward is yang, covering is yin; ascending is yang, descending is yin; clear is yang, turbid is yin; great yang and small yin, high yang and low yin, beauty is yang, ugliness is yin. Extending this by category, there is nothing that is not so, no time that is not so. The more finely it is analyzed, the more subtle it becomes; the more deeply it is explored, the more boundless it grows.\"",
      "overlap_context": "o arise. Only withered wood and dead ashes are purely yin.'\n\nHe also said: 'If the Two do not stand, the One cannot be seen. If the One cannot be seen, the function of the Two ceases.' And: 'The One gives rise to spirit; the Two give rise to transformation.' The Two are the waxing and waning, advancing and retreating of yin and yang.\n\nMaster Zhu said: 'Master Zhang’s words here are exceedingly precise. Without the One, the waxing and waning of yin and yang would have no means of manifestation.'\"",

on earth, yin moves and diminishes yang.\nAt the extreme of yin, the twelve residual yang of *Kun* ultimately complete *Qian*, yielding thirty-six yang.\nAt the extreme of yang, the twelve residual yin of *Qian* ultimately complete *Kun*, yielding thirty-six yin.\nFrom the yang of *Kun* arise *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶), totaling twenty yang; from the twelve yin of *Qian* arise *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱), totaling twenty yin.\nDispersing one into three marks the beginning of generation.\nCombined, they number thirty-two, with yin and yang each occupying half of the eight positions.\nFrom the twenty-eight yang of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* arises the thirty-six yang of *Qian*; from the twenty-eight yin of *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* arises the thirty-six yin of *Kun*.\nConverging three into one marks the culmination of generation.\nCombined, they number sixty-four, with yin and yang each occupying the full eight positions.\nThus, from the Beginning of Spring to the Beginning of Autumn, the sum of yang numbers is sixty-four, while yin numbers total thirty-two.\nFrom the Beginning of Autumn to the Beginning of Spring, the sum of yin numbers is sixty-four, while yang numbers total thirty-two.\nFour times eight is thirty-two, the completion of the four trigrams.\nEight times eight is sixty-four, the completion of the eight trigrams.\nThe left diagram shows thirty-two yang, the right thirty-two yin, dividing the bodies of heaven and earth—combined, they form the sixty-four hexagrams.\nAt the extreme of yang, no yin exists; at the extreme of yin, no yang exists.\n\nMaster Shao says: *Li* (☲) in the east and *Kan* (☵) in the west stand at the midpoint of yin and yang, serving as the gates of spring, autumn, day, and night.\nHe also says: Yang encroaches upon yin, and yin encroaches upon yang—thus *Kan* and *Li* occupy the midpoint.\nThe qi of the sixty-four precelestial hexagrams all arise from the center, with the eight trigrams corresponding to the twelve earthly branches.\n*Zi* (子), *Wu* (午), *Mao* (卯), and *You* (酉) are the four centers.\n*Qian* corresponds to *Wu*, *Kun* to *Zi*, *Li* to *Mao*, and *Kan* to *You*.\nThus it is said: *Qian* and *Kun* establish the positions of above and below; *Kan* and *Li* arrange the gates of left and right—this is their proper alignment.\nThe trigrams of the four corners are: *Dui* (☱) at *Chen* (辰) and *Si* (巳), *Zhen* (☳) at *Chou* (丑) and *Yin* (寅), *Xun* (☴) at *Wei* (未), *Gen* (☶) at *Shen* (申), and *Xu* (戌) and *Hai* (亥).\nMaster Shao further says: *Kan* and *Li* mark the boundary of yin and yang.\n*Li* corresponds to *Yin* (寅), *Kan* to *Shen* (申)—those who examine the numbers often verify this as the overflow of yin and yang.\nThis means that the application of numbers does not exceed the center, with *Yin*, *Shen*, *Si*, and *Hai* occupying the heads of the four seasons.\n*Qian* corresponds to *Si* and is born at *Si*; *Kun* corresponds to *Hai* and is born at *Hai*.\n*Li* corresponds to *Yin* and is bounded by the midpoint of the three yang; *Kan* corresponds to *Shen* and is bounded by the midpoint of the three yin—when centered, they exceed their bounds and overflow.\nMoreover, as qi waxes and wanes, the remainder is six.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"At midday, it turns back; when the moon is full, it wanes.\"\nThis also reflects Master Shao’s caution regarding excess, retreating one position to reside in *Mao* (卯), *Chen* (辰), *Dui* (☱); *Zi* (子), *Chou* (丑), *Zhen* (☳); *Wu* (午), *Wei* (未), *Xun* (☴); and *You* (酉), *Xu* (戌), *Gen* (☶)—all positioned where numbers fall short, not exceeding the center.\nThus, the midpoint of *Kan* and *Li* corresponds to the midpoint of yin and yang.\nIf *Kun* is taken as the midpoint of *Zi*, then *Mao* and *You* are centered.\nTherefore, *Mao* is the gate of the sun, residing on the left, where the great yang is born.\n*You* is the gate of the moon, residing on the right, where the great yin is born.\nAs the gates of spring, autumn, day, and night: at the spring equinox, yang is centered; at the autumn equinox, yin is centered.\nThus it is said: \"Midday and midnight are equal, as are day and night.\"\nThis is unlike the summer solstice, when daylight is longer, or the winter solstice, when night is longer.\nNot only do the sun and moon rise and set here, but all things are born into life and enter death within it.\n\nMaster Weng says: Though heaven and earth begin at *Yin* (寅), the opening of things reaches *Mao* (卯), where the gate is fully opened.\nThough they begin at *Xu* (戌), the closing of things reaches *You* (酉), where the gate is already shut.\nIn a year, there are spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in a month, there are crescent, full, waning, and new moons; in a day, there are dawn, day, dusk, and night.\nThough all depend on the functions of *Kan*, *Li*, the sun, and the moon, none occur without the gates of left and right.\n\nMaster Zhang says: *Li* corresponds to *Mao* and ends at *Shen*—this is the division of day.\n*Kan* corresponds to *You* and ends at *Yin*—this is the division of night.\nHe also says: *Li* corresponds to *Yin*, *Wei* (未), and *Mao*, where it is already bright; *Kan* corresponds to *Shen*, *Si* (巳), and *You*, where it is not yet dark.\nHeaven overcomes earth to create the surplus, so daylight is always longer than night by five *ke*—*Li* yang encroaches upon *Kan* yin, and daytime yang encroaches upon nighttime yin.\nIn my humble opinion, speaking of the greater numbers: things open after the Waking of Insects (*Jingzhe*) and close before the Beginning of Winter (*Lidong*)—yin and yang mutually encroach upon one another.\nThus, *Qian* is fully used, *Kun* is fully unused, and *Kan* and *Li* are half-used.\nThe two hexagrams *Kan* and *Li* are the intermingling of the middle lines of *Qian* and *Kun*.\nIn the precelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Mao* and *You* as the sun and moon.\nIn the postcelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Zi* and *Wu* as water and fire.\nOnly these four positions are most excellent: within yang there is yin, and within yin there is yang—such are the subtle intentions of Fu Xi and King Wen.",

      "translated_text": "The other hexagrams, if not biased, become mixed. Master Zhu said: The Five Phases mutually serve as yin and yang, and each also has its own yin and yang. Spring is *lesser yang*, summer is *greater yang*. Autumn is *lesser yin*, winter is *greater yin*. This is spoken in terms of their flow through the four seasons. From the perspective of a year, six months are yang and six months are yin. A day is likewise: daytime is yang, night is yin; before noon is yang, after noon is yin. In a month, the period before the full moon is yang, and after the full moon is yin. In the *six jia* cycles, *jiazi* is yang, *yichou* is yin. Speaking in divisions, *jia* is yang and *zi* is yin.

Heaven and Earth are one great yin and yang, and a year, a month, a day, an hour—all flow forth from within them.\n\nMoreover, spring is the beginning of yang, summer is the extreme of yang. Autumn is the beginning of yin, winter is the extreme of yin. When yang begins, there is warmth; when yang reaches its extreme, there is heat. When yin begins, there is coolness; when yin reaches its extreme, there is cold. Warmth gives rise to things, heat makes things grow. Coolness gathers things, cold destroys things. These are the transformations of the single *qi*.\n\nYang arises from below and ascends, thus advancing to generate things. Yin arises from above and descends, thus retreating to complete things. Yang resides in the southeast, governing spring and summer to give life. Yin resides in the northwest, governing autumn and winter to destroy. This is the general outline.\n\nMaster Shao said: *Greater yang* becomes the sun, *greater yin* becomes the moon. *Lesser yang* becomes the stars, *lesser yin* becomes the celestial bodies. Their transformations give rise to heat and cold, day and night, rain and wind, dew and thunder.\n\nSomeone asked about thunder, wind, rain, snow, frost, clouds, and dew. Master Zhang replied: When yin *qi* congeals and yang is trapped within unable to emerge, it struggles and strikes to become thunder. When yang is outside and unable to enter, it revolves ceaselessly to become wind. Their gatherings vary in distance and fullness, thus wind and thunder differ in magnitude and intensity. When dispersed gently and harmoniously, they become snow, frost, rain, and dew; when dispersed disharmoniously, they become perverse *qi* and yin haze. Yin constantly disperses and receives exchange from yang, thus wind and rain are regulated and cold and heat are balanced.\n\nHe also said: When yang is burdened by yin, they contend to form rain. When yin descends and yang obtains it, it scatters and rises as clouds. Thus, the patterned distribution of cloud things across the great void is yin driven by wind, gathered but not yet dispersed.\n\nSomeone asked Master Shao about rain, wind, clouds, and thunder. He answered: Yang obtaining yin becomes rain; yin obtaining yang becomes wind. Hard obtaining soft becomes clouds; soft obtaining hard becomes thunder. Without yin, there can be no rain; without yang, there can be no thunder. Rain, being soft, belongs to yin and awaits yang before arising. Thunder, being hard, belongs to yang and awaits yin before erupting.\n\nMaster Zhang explained: When yang leads and yin follows, flowing together, it becomes rain. When yin obstructs and yang presses, scattering, it becomes wind. When hard leads and soft follows, steaming, it forms clouds. When soft stores and hard moves, striking, it forms thunder. Whether as guest or host, preceding or following, yin and yang act in opposition or accord—these differ.\n\nWind and rain descend from heaven, thus they are spoken of in terms of yin and yang. Clouds and thunder rise from earth, thus they are spoken of in terms of soft and hard. Heaven’s yang, without yin, cannot form rain. Earth’s yin, without yang, cannot produce thunder. Rain, being yin in form and soft, originates from heaven’s yang *qi*. Thunder, being yang in sound and hard, emerges from earth’s yin body. Yin and yang mutually employ one another.\n\nSomeone asked Master Cai Jieqai about the line images of the eight hexagrams. He answered: When *Kan* yin is obtained by yang, it ascends as clouds; if yang is shallow, it becomes mist. When *Kan* yang is burdened by yin, it streams as rain; if yin is shallow, it becomes dew. When yin is outside and yang cannot emerge, it becomes thunder. If yin is solid, it becomes an earthquake—this is *Zhen*. When yin is inside and yang cannot enter, it becomes wind. If yin is solid, it becomes a great wind—this is *Xun*. When yang envelops yin, *Li* becomes sleet; when yang harmonizes with yin, it becomes snow—this is *Li* intersecting *Kan*. When yin envelops yang, *Kan* becomes thunder; when yin enters yang, it becomes frost—this is *Kan* intersecting *Li*. When the essence of yin and yang mutually reside in each other’s abodes, *Li* becomes the sun and *Kan* becomes the moon. When yin and yang clash, it becomes lightning; when yin and yang are out of place, it becomes a rainbow.\n\nHe also said: *Qi* ascends from *zi* to *wu* and descends from *wu* to *zi*. From *zi* to *yin*, it rises from within the earth to above the earth; from *mao* to *si*, it rises from within the earth to the midst of heaven. From *wu* to *shen*, it descends from the midst of heaven to above the earth; from *you* to *hai*, it descends from above the earth to within the earth.\n\nIn my humble observation: *Zi* and *wu* each have six, bounded by the earth. Yang arises from *zi* to *yin*, thus from the eleventh month to the first month, yang *qi* ascends above the earth. *Lesser yang* is seven, yang within yin. From *mao* to *si*, the second to the fourth month, it rises from within the earth to the midst of heaven. *Greater yang* is nine, yang within yang. Then, from the moment one yin arises at *wu* to *shen*, the fifth to the seventh month, yin *qi* descends from the midst of heaven to above the earth. *Lesser yin* is eight, yin within yang. From *you* to *hai*, the eighth to the tenth month, it descends from above the earth to within the earth. *Greater yin* is six, yin within yin. A day and a month are likewise.\n\nGenerally, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* correspond to the transitions of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Tai*, and *Pi*. The three yangs and three yins are all employed by heaven. *Zhen* is lesser, reaching *Qian* it becomes greater. *Xun* is lesser, reaching *Kun* it becomes greater. *Kan* and *Li*, with their four yins and four yangs, generate things in their midst. The three yins and three yangs oppose *Tai* and *Pi*. The six yins and six yangs oppose *Qian* and *Kun*. Like the number of water being six, as in snowflakes—six is not fabricated by humans; all things in creation are thus. From this, the marvel of yin and yang can be seen.\n\nHe also said: *Greater softness* becomes water, *greater hardness* becomes fire. *Lesser softness* becomes earth, *lesser hardness* becomes stone.",
      "overlap_context": "fully used, *Kun* is fully unused, and *Kan* and *Li* are half-used.\nThe two hexagrams *Kan* and *Li* are the intermingling of the middle lines of *Qian* and *Kun*.\nIn the precelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Mao* and *You* as the sun and moon.\nIn the postcelestial arrangement, *Kan* and *Li* occupy *Zi* and *Wu* as water and fire.\nOnly these four positions are most excellent: within yang there is yin, and within yin there is yang—such are the subtle intentions of Fu Xi and King Wen.",

      "translated_text": "Their transformations manifest as creatures that run and fly, grasses and trees, colors and sounds, *qi* and flavors. The yang gives rise to mobile beings; the yin gives rise to rooted plants.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"It is fundamentally one principle, yet through waxing and waning, expansion and contraction, yin and yang arise. Even in the most minute and subtle things—grasses, trees, birds, and beasts—this holds true. For example, the carp bears thirty-six scales, a yin number. The dragon’s back bears eighty-one scales, a yang number. The tortoise’s shell has five segments at its center, corresponding to the Five Phases. On either side are four segments each, corresponding to the Eight Trigrams. Around the perimeter are twenty-four segments, corresponding to the twenty-four solar terms. As for grasses and trees—whether male and female, ginkgo and paulownia, hemp and bamboo—all follow this pattern.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Even dregs and ashes are nothing but teachings.\" I once applied the principles of the *Huangji Jingshi Shu* to deduce that there are creatures of flight—flying trees, flying grasses, flying creatures that run—and creatures of running—running fliers, running trees, running grasses, running runners. There are also tree-fliers, tree-runners, tree-grasses, tree-trees, as well as grass-fliers, grass-runners, grass-trees, and grass-grasses. Further, when divided by yin and yang, fliers belong to yang and runners to yin; mobile beings to yang and rooted plants to yin; horses to yang and oxen to yin; horns to yang and tails to yin. None escape the reckoning of yin and yang.\n\nGenerally, colors, sounds, *qi*, and flavors—each corresponds to the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and every thing possesses them. Yet some are partial and incomplete, while others are complete but ineffectual, as in the case of human intelligence.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Look near at the body, and the hundred principles are all present in the *qi* of contraction and extension—this can be seen in the breath between the nostrils. The nostrils are the Gate of Heaven, through which *qi* enters and exits.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"In terms of *qi*, exhalation is yang and pertains to expansion, while inhalation is yin and pertains to contraction. As with the breath through the nose, there is no moment without inhalation, no moment without exhalation. When exhalation is exhausted, inhalation arises; when inhalation is exhausted, exhalation arises.\"\n\nMinister Hu Wending said: \"In one day and night, a person takes 13,560 breaths.\"\n\nMaster Zhang of Hengqu said: \"The mingling of the *hun* gives rise to dreams, a tumult of a hundred sensations. Relative to waking, this is the day and night of the body. When *qi* presses forth, it is spring, and the myriad things intermingle. Relative to autumn, this is the day and night of heaven and earth.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is nature; movement and stillness, yin and yang, are the heart-mind. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. The body and its blood and flesh are the Five Phases. Thus, when the eyes open, it is either yin or yang, either benevolence or righteousness. Advancing is yang; retreating is yin. In self-cultivation, one line is yin; in responding to affairs and engaging with things, it is yang. Another line states: that which is not yet settled belongs to yang; that which is settled belongs to yin.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Heaven has the four seasons; earth has the four directions; humans have the four limbs. The joints of the fingers can reveal heaven; the lines of the palm can discern earth. The principles of heaven and earth are fully present in the palm.\"\n\nThe exegete said: \"The hands face upward, aligned with heaven; the feet are square and face downward, aligned with earth. The hands can turn and flip, but the feet cannot—yang can encompass yin, but yin cannot encompass yang. The back of the palm is high, the front is low; the southeast has much water, the northwest has many mountains. Where they gather are rivers and marshes, and the lines in the palm resemble rivers and the shape of the hand. From the wrist to the elbow to the shoulder, and from the toes to the knee to the thigh and hip, there are three joints each, corresponding to the twelve stations. The four limbs correspond to heaven’s four seasons and earth’s four directions. The four fingers each have three joints, corresponding to the twelve earthly branches. Together, they correspond to the twenty-four solar terms. The thumb has three joints, two of which are yin and yang; the hidden one is the Supreme Ultimate, the great thing. Combined, they number thirty-two, corresponding to the heavenly hexagrams. Together with the hands and feet, they number sixty-four, encompassing the earthly hexagrams. The earth’s body culminates in sixteen; one hand has sixteen numbers, of which fifteen are manifest. The one is the Supreme Ultimate, hidden between the great things.\n\nEach of the four limbs has one vessel, corresponding to the four seasons. Each vessel has three sections, corresponding to the three months of a season. Each section has three periods, corresponding to the three ten-day weeks of a month. This is the *Qian* strategy.\n\nThe *Suwen* speaks of the twelve seasonal nodes, all of which communicate with heavenly *qi*. The twelve seasonal nodes correspond to the twelve meridians of the human body—referring to the three yins and three yangs of the hands and feet—and the three periods refer to the deep, floating, and middle yin and yang, which may be excessive or deficient.\n\nIt also states: \"Heaven and earth are but one *qi*. When divided into yin and yang, they become two things. Thus, yang is benevolence, and yin is righteousness. Yet yin and yang each further divide into two. Thus, the inception of yang is Wood, spring, and benevolence; the fullness of yang is Fire, summer, and propriety. The inception of yin is Metal, autumn, and righteousness; the extreme of yin is Water, winter, and wisdom. This encompasses the Three Powers and doubles them.\n\nWhen viewed as one *qi*, yin and yang may also be seen as two *qi*. They may be observed as they change with the seasons, or in the great openings and closings, the great waxings and wanings of the cosmos, as well as in the small openings and closings, the small waxings and wanings of the minute. Whether in the vast span of 129,600 years or in a year, a month, a day, or an hour, it is all thus. Though there may be ten thousand changes within, their principle remains constant and unchanging.

      "translated_text": "**Expounding the Five [Phases]**\n\nMaster Zheng cites the *Baihutong*: \"Movement is the qi of Heaven’s activity.\" Water serves as the standard, for water lies in the Yellow Springs, nurturing all things with impartial constancy. Fire is transformation. When yang qi prevails, the myriad things undergo change. Metal is restraint. In autumn, the myriad things are constrained by yin qi. Wood is arousal. Yang qi stirs and leaps, bursting forth from the earth. Earth is spouting. Earth, dwelling at the center, universally brings forth the myriad things.\n\nThat which engenders things follows the numbers seven and eight of wood and fire. That which completes things follows the numbers nine and six of metal and water. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The essence of qi becomes things\"—the commentary notes seven and eight. \"The wandering soul undergoes change\"—the commentary notes nine and six.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] says: The Supreme Polarity arrays the Five [Phases] beneath yin and yang. The Five Constants are principle, while yin and yang are qi. Without qi, principle would have no place to stand; thus the Five Phases follow yin and yang. He further states: Righteousness and wisdom pertain to yin; benevolence and ritual pertain to yang. Yin and yang are qi, while the Five Phases are substance. With this substance, and with the qi of the Five Phases, things are thus produced.\n\nThis fool says: The Five Phases belong to the postnatal. If one inquires into the prenatal, the One is the Supreme Polarity. From the One dividing into two, there arises yin and yang. Yin and yang are the qi of the Five Phases; the Five Phases are the substantial forms of yin and yang. One, three, five, seven, and nine are the Five Phases of Heaven. Two, four, six, eight, and ten are the Five Phases of Earth. Two and five make ten; when yin and yang unite as one, they can engender and complete the myriad things. Thus above, the *Daybook* says: \"One is the Five Phases alone.\" Within the One there are two.\n\nJia (yang) and Yi (yin) form Wood; Bing (yang) and Ding (yin) form Fire; Wu (yang) and Ji (yin) form Earth; Geng (yang) and Xin (yin) form Metal; Ren (yang) and Gui (yin) form Water—these are of Heaven. Hai (yin) and Zi (yang), the north; Yin (yang) and Mao (yin), the east; Si (yang) and Wu (yin), the south; Shen (yang) and You (yin), the west; Chen (yang) and Xu (yang), Chou (yin) and Wei (yin)—these occupy the center and are of Earth. The spirit of Wood governs benevolence; the spirit of Metal governs righteousness; the spirit of Fire governs ritual; the spirit of Water governs wisdom; the spirit of Earth governs trust—these are of Man. Uniting the Three Powers as one, qi flows and principle likewise flows.\n\nMaster Zhou [Dunyi] says: Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth. Master Zhu says: The Five Phases’ substance resides in Earth, while their qi flows in Heaven. Speaking of their generative sequence in terms of substance, it is Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, Earth—here, Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin. Speaking of their operational sequence in terms of qi, it is Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water—here, Wood and Fire are yang, while Metal and Water are yin. For their transformations are boundless, and nowhere do they not follow the Dao of yin and yang.\n\nHe further states: Water’s yin is rooted in yang; Fire’s yang is rooted in yin. Interwoven, they give rise to life. In their cyclical movement, Water engenders Wood, Wood engenders Fire, Fire engenders Earth, Earth engenders Metal, Metal engenders Water, Water engenders Wood—thus they circulate in mutual flourishing. Again, Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, and Gui are all of this same thing.\n\nHuang Mianzhai says: The *Diagram Explanation* states that Water’s yin is abundant and Fire’s yang is abundant—this is their operational sequence, not their generative sequence. Viewed from the establishment of the *zi* [midnight] hour, Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin—this is their generative sequence. He further says: There is one point of doubt in the *Diagram of the Supreme Polarity*. The diagram places Water, with its abundant yin, on the right, and Fire, with its abundant yang, on the left. Metal, being yin, follows Water; Wood, being yang, follows Fire—this explains their generative sequence. Yet the text below states that Water and Wood are yang, while Fire and Metal are yin, thus making Water yang and Fire yin. In considering the initial arising of things, they are naturally tender and immature. When yang first arises, as Water, it is still soft and weak; by the time Wood is engendered, it has grown strong. When yin first arises, as Fire, it is still faint; by the time Metal is engendered, it has taken form. Thus Water is yang in its inception, Wood is yang in its fullness, Fire is yin in its inception, and Metal is yin in its fullness.\n\nHe further states: The generation of the Five Phases, each with its own nature. In terms of qi and substance, Water’s nature is cold, Fire’s is hot, Wood’s is warm, Metal’s is frozen, and Earth’s is harmonious. When humans are born, they likewise differ in intelligence, foolishness, strength, and weakness according to the qi and substance they receive. Yet when each returns to its root, it possesses its own nature. This is what is meant by the Supreme Polarity’s wholeness being fully present within each thing. Thus humans, alone among beings, receive the finest essence of the Five Phases, and their minds are most numinous.\n\nMaster Cheng says: Kan is Water. The One begins at the center, being the first of the engendered. Heaven engenders Water with the One, so Water stands first among the Five Phases. When things first arise, their forms are all water. Water is one source of the myriad things, all rooted in the creative transformation of Heaven’s One. Even the production of metal and stone begins as a fluid. The qi of the first yang, the first hour of the day, the eleventh month of the year, and the Winter Solstice all commence at *zi*. *Zi* is the position of Water. Now, Water is engendered by yang yet completed by yin. When qi first stirs, yang arises; when qi gathers and stills, it becomes water—observe the breath, and it is visible. The inception of Water belongs to the One, hence it is subtle. When Water is formed, it becomes six.\n\nSomeone asked: Is there evidence for Heaven engendering Water with the One? The answer: The human body provides evidence. When the heart of hunger stirs, saliva is produced; when the heart of sorrow stirs, tears are produced; when the heart of shame stirs, sweat is produced; when the heart of desire stirs, essence is produced. When the human heart is quiescent and unmoving, it is the Supreme Polarity. When this heart stirs, the Supreme Polarity moves and yang arises. Thus when the heart stirs and Water is engendered, this can serve as evidence for Heaven engendering Water with the One.",

      "translated_text": "The spirit governs qi, and when the spirit moves, qi follows. Qi is the mother of Water, and when qi gathers, Water is born.\n\nMaster Zhu said: In the sequence of the Five Phases, Wood is the beginning, Water is the end, and Earth is the center. According to the numbers in the *Diagram* and the *Book*, Water is one, Wood is three, and Earth is five—all odd numbers of yang’s generative sequence and unalterable. Thus they take turns as the principal, forming the warp of the Five Phases.\n\nThe Five Phases: Spring begins with Wood in the East, Winter ends with Water in the North, and Earth presides in the center—this is the sequence of beginning, middle, and end. Yet the sequence of their generation all begins with Heaven.\n\nWater can moisten and nourish the myriad things; Heaven’s One first engenders Water. Water has the nature of steadfast stillness, firm and potent, concealed in Winter. Wood can warm and nurture the myriad things; Heaven’s Three engenders Wood. Wood has the nature of sprouting forth, inexhaustible and unrestrained, flourishing in Spring. Earth can bear and sustain the myriad things; Heaven’s Five engenders Earth. Earth is the mother of nurturance, upright and vast, dwelling in the center and flourishing in the four directions. Once these three are born, they ceaselessly generate, each occupying its own direction, immutable.\n\nThus we see Heaven’s heart of loving life: the source is upright, and the offspring are good—all are Heaven-born. Fire and Metal, however, are those within the Five Phases that rely on one another for transformation and cannot be absent for a single day, yet they are Earth-born.\n\nFire is born from Earth’s Two; its nature is to flame upward, sometimes existing from non-existence, sometimes non-existing from existence. Its position may be in the South or the West. Metal is born from Earth’s Four; its nature is to follow and reform, sometimes square made round, round made square. Its position may be in the West or the South. Thus the *Diagram* and the *Book* speak of rearrangement, unlike Water, Wood, and Earth, which are Heaven-born and have a fixed sequence.\n\nYet within this fixed sequence, the Five Phases ceaselessly generate, mutually permeating one another. Though the sequence is fixed, their qi is never unconnected. Thus Master Zhu said: They take turns as the principal, forming the warp of the Five Phases. He also said: Wood encompasses the Five Phases, for it flows through and penetrates all without exception.\n\nRao Shuangfeng said: Qi moves through Heaven with generation as its principal. Thus Master Zhu took Spring as the first of the four seasons, running through Summer, Autumn, and Winter. In humans, compassion is the first of the four beginnings, running through shame, deference, and right and wrong. For Spring can generate the myriad things, and compassion can embrace all virtues.\n\nMaster An said: When One is beneath Wood, it is the root—returning to the root and recovering the mandate, uniting with Five. When One is above Wood, it is the branch—sending forth limbs and leaves, scattering into the myriad. From One, know the myriad. Heaven’s One engenders Water and thus Wood—all share this One.\n\nHe also said: Water encompasses the Five Phases, for it returns to the root, restores the mandate, and conceals itself therein. Wood without Water withers, Fire without Water dries, Metal without Water stagnates. With Water to encompass them, they flow through the four seasons, animating the myriad things. When its work is done, it retreats and hides within the two yin, lying hidden at the Yellow Springs’ depths—thus it can return to the root and recover the mandate. When it emerges, it is once more primal and penetrating, like thunder shaking the earth and rain soaking the world.\n\nIn humans, it is the essence stored in the kidneys, moistening all the body. He also said: Earth is the lodging of Water and Fire, the resource of Metal and Wood, dwelling in the center and responding to the four directions—one body bearing the myriad kinds.\n\nRao Shuangfeng said: Substance resides in Earth, with nurturance as its principal. Thus Earth dwells at the center of the Five Phases, governing Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. In humans, the spleen dwells at the center of the five viscera, governing the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. For Earth can nurture the myriad things, and the spleen can nurture all forms.\n\nIn the last month of Summer, Earth is most flourishing, thus it can engender Autumn’s Metal. It also flourishes in the four seasons, each season for eighteen days, totaling seventy-two days. The other four Phases divide the four seasons, each also receiving seventy-two days, together making three hundred and sixty days.\n\nMaster Weng said: The Five Phases, separated from Earth, cannot each become a vessel. One united with Five becomes Water. Two united with Five becomes Fire. Three united with Five becomes Wood. Four united with Five becomes Metal. Five united with Five becomes Earth. Five is Earth, dwelling in the center. One, two, three, four, five—once five is reached, Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth are formed, called six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.\n\nHe also said: Heaven and Earth are the fixed forms of yin and yang’s opposition. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten are the sequence of yin and yang’s flow. Without opposition, there can be no flow, and no transformation. Without flow, there can be no self-movement. Thus the Five Phases flow through Heaven and Earth to fulfill their function.\n\nIn transformation: One transforms into six, becoming Water. Two transforms into seven, becoming Fire. Three transforms into eight, becoming Wood. Four transforms into nine, becoming Metal. Five transforms into ten, becoming Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of oppositions. Next, the Five Phases each form their own oppositions. This is the *Yi* of exchange: Fire opposes Water, Metal opposes Wood. In opposition, there are two—this is the fixed form. In flow, there is circulation, and in circulation, there is one—this is the *Yi* of change.\n\nThe Five Phases generate one another: Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Metal again generates Water. In their opposition, each is half a body.",

      "translated_text": "In circulation, all are complete bodies. In opposition and flow, each has its own sequence.\n\nSpeaking of a single *qi*: when exhalation reaches its extreme, it turns to waning; when waning reaches its extreme, it turns to exhalation. Speaking of two *qi*: when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises; when yin reaches its extreme, yang arises.\n\nSpeaking of the four seasons: that which is overcome becomes husband and wife; that which is generated becomes mother and child. The husband takes a wife, and the husband’s blood and *qi* daily diminish—thus summer transforms into autumn. The mother bears a child, and the child’s blood and *qi* daily flourish—thus winter changes into spring.\n\nSpeaking of the Five Phases: *wu* and *ji* inquire among the ten Celestial Stems; *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* inquire among the twelve Earthly Branches. The Center mediates between the four directions; *kun* inquires between *li* and *dui*. Fire generates Earth, and Earth generates Metal.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Yang transforms and yin unites, first giving rise to Water and Fire. Water and Fire are *qi*. Flowing and flickering, their forms remain insubstantial, their shapes not yet fixed. Next arise Metal and Wood, which are firmly established in fixed forms.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate beings, first the light and pure, then the heavy and turbid. Among the Five Phases, Water and Fire are the lightest and purest; Metal and Wood follow, while Earth is the heaviest and most turbid.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Water and Fire are *qi*. Thus Fire flames upward and Water moistens downward, ascending and descending with yin and yang. Earth cannot restrain them. Wood as a thing: when Water is clear, Fire is born, yet they do not part.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Zheng Meng* states only that the substantial forms of Metal and Wood belong to Earth, while Water and Fire do not belong to Earth. Someone asked: Since Fire arises attached to Water, does it not also belong to Earth? He replied: Fire is a thing of empty space. Asked: Is warmth and heat merely *qi* and thus Fire? He replied: Yes. The darkness within Fire is the yin within *li*. The clarity within Water is the yang within *kan*. Within Fire there is blackness—yin Water within yang. That which is black outside and bright inside is yang within yin. Thus Water may be called yang, and Fire may be called yin.\n\nMaster Zhang further said: When yang is submerged in yin, it becomes Water; when it clings to yin, it becomes Fire. Wood and Metal are the blossoms and fruits of Earth, their natures mingled with Water and Fire. Thus when Wood is steeped in Water, Fire is born, yet they do not part—further proof of Earth’s floating blossom at the intersection of Water and Fire. Metal obtains Fire’s essence from Earth’s dryness and Water’s essence from Water’s moisture. Thus Water and Fire sustain each other without harm; when smelted, they flow back without depletion—further proof of Earth’s essential solidity at the juncture of Water and Fire.\n\nHuang of Mianzhai said: Examining the initial generation of humans and things, Heaven’s one generates Water, and Water at once takes form. When humans are born, essence and blood unite to form the body, just as in creation there is Water. Earth’s two generates Fire, and Fire at once has *qi*. When humans have this body, they can produce sound. Sound is the work of *qi*, just as in creation there is Fire. Water is yin and Fire is yang; appearance also belongs to yin, while speech also belongs to yang. Though Water and Fire have form and substance, they arise at creation’s beginning. Thus Water only moistens, and Fire only flames—yet their forms remain light and pure. When Heaven’s three generates Wood and Earth’s four generates Metal, their forms and substances are fully complete, just as when the human body’s ears and eyes are formed, the human shape is complete. Wood is yang and Metal is yin, just as seeing is yang and hearing is yin.\n\nAt creation’s beginning, Heaven’s one generates Water, and three generates Wood; Earth’s two generates Fire, and four generates Metal. Heaven obtains one odd number and generates Water; one’s extreme is three, thus three generates Wood. Earth obtains two even numbers and generates Fire; two’s extreme is four, thus four generates Metal. The completion of Water at six resembles *kan*, with one yang residing within—Heaven’s one generates Water. Earth’s six envelops externally, with yang scarce and yin abundant, and Water begins to flourish and form. The completion of Fire at seven resembles *li*, with one yin residing within—Earth’s two generates Fire. Heaven’s seven envelops externally, with yin scarce and yang abundant, and Fire begins to flourish and form.\n\nSomeone asked: If one generates Water but Water is not yet complete, and two generates Fire but Fire is not yet complete, must one wait until the Five Phases are all present before six and seven complete Water and Fire? If so, creation would never be whole. Rather, the *qi* of Water and Fire are one moist and one dry. When Water’s moisture reaches its extreme, Wood is born; when Fire’s dryness reaches its extreme, Metal is born. The beginning of humans and things is merely the gathering of essence and *qi*. Essence is moist and *qi* is dry; essence sinks while *qi* rises. Thus essence becomes appearance, and *qi* becomes speech. When essence flourishes, moisture reaches its extreme—thus it becomes the eyes, the liver, and sight. When *qi* flourishes, dryness reaches its extreme—thus it becomes Metal, the lungs, and hearing. Generally, appearance and sight belong to essence, so when essence wanes, the eyes dim. Speech and hearing belong to *qi*, so when *qi* is obstructed, the ears grow deaf. This is clearly evident.\n\nPhysicians assign the ears to the kidneys and the lungs to Metal. Compared with this arrangement, there are differences.\n\nLiu of Yunzhuang said: Yin and yang are mutually rooted. Water resides in the *zi* position, the direction of extreme yin, yet yang is already born at *zi*. Fire resides in the *wu* position, the direction of extreme yang, yet yin is already born at *wu*. Wood, born from Heaven’s three, belongs entirely to yang, thus its movement in spring also belongs to yang. Metal, born from Earth’s four, belongs entirely to yin, thus its movement in autumn also belongs to yin. One cannot speak of them in terms of yin-yang mutuality, for Water and Fire have not yet parted from *qi*. At the beginning of yin-yang union, their *qi* naturally possesses the wonder of mutual rooting. Wood is yang’s expansion, and Metal is yin’s contraction—they have fixed substances. This is why they differ from Water and Fire.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Music* tones are Earth, Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire; the *Hong Fan* sequence is Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "The *Music* distinguishes the five tones as nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, and sixteen. The *Hong Fan* divides the four directions as one, two, three, four, and five.\n\nIt is further said: The *Hong Fan* speaks of one, two, three, four, and five, but does not mention six, seven, eight, nine, or ten. The *Monthly Ordinances* speaks of eight, seven, five, nine, and six, but does not mention one, two, three, four, or ten. The *Great Mystery* speaks of three, eight, four, nine, two, seven, one, six, and five, but does not mention ten.\n\nThe *Hong Fan* orders them as Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth; Yu orders them as Water, Fire, Metal, Wood, and Earth; Liu Xiang and Ban Gu order them as Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water; Fan Ye orders them as Wood, Metal, Fire, Earth, and Water.\n\nIt is also said: The five phases possess substance in Earth, while their *qi* moves in Heaven. Cai Jiufeng said: Flowing through the four seasons in Heaven, they are called the five phases; on Earth, where humans draw upon them, they are called the five materials. Tang scholar Kong said: The five phases are ordered from the subtle to the manifest. Water is the most subtle, thus ranked one; Fire gradually manifests, thus ranked two; Wood takes form and substance, thus ranked three; Metal is solid and firm, thus ranked four; Earth is vast and substantial, thus ranked five. This is verified by the *Hong Fan*.\n\nCai said: Moistening, flaming, bending-straightening, transforming, and sowing-reaping—these describe their natures by function and their virtues by capacity. Water moistens and flows downward; Fire flames and rises upward; Wood bends and straightens; Metal obeys and transforms; Earth encompasses the four directions and possesses the virtue of generation. Thus, its emphasis lies in sowing and reaping, for the people regard food as heaven.\n\nFeng said: Sowing is *jia* (planting), and reaping is *se* (harvesting). Cai’s commentary speaks of *jia* and *se* together to express their ceaseless generation.\n\nIt is further said: Salty, bitter, sour, pungent, and sweet—these are the flavors of the five phases. The five phases possess sound, color, *qi*, and flavor, but only flavor is mentioned here because it is most essential to human use. The five flavors are based on the five grains. According to the *Monthly Ordinances*, the correspondence of the five grains to the five phases is: wheat to Wood, millet to Fire, broomcorn millet to Earth, hemp to Metal, and beans to Water. In terms of the five livestock: goose to Wood, sheep to Fire, ox to Earth, dog to Metal, and pig to Water. In terms of the five fruits: chestnut to Water, plum to Wood, apricot to Fire, peach to Metal, and jujube to Earth. All these possess substance in Earth and are indispensable to human sustenance, not to be lacking even for a day. When this *qi* circulates in Heaven, it becomes the five phases; when this substance congeals on Earth, it becomes the five materials.\n\nHeaven has the sun, thus Earth has Fire. Heaven has the moon, thus Earth has Water. Heaven has rain, sunshine, cold, warmth, and wind, thus Earth has Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth. From Heaven to Earth, and from Earth to Heaven, filling the cosmos—what is not of the five phases? Moreover, humans are born with the finest *qi* of the five phases; who does not rely on the five phases for use?\n\nShaozi said: Fire is born from non-being, Water from being. Fire is dark within and bright without, thus *li* (Fire) has yang on the outside. Fire’s function lies in its exterior. Water is dark without and bright within, thus *kan* (Water) has yang on the inside. Water’s function lies in its interior. Fire functions externally, symbolized by the eye; Water functions internally, symbolized by the ear. The interior is the body, the exterior is function. Water’s exterior is its body, its interior is function. Yang is function.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Yin takes yang as its substance, and yang takes yin as its substance. Water is bright within and dark without; Fire is dark within and bright without. The essence of yin and yang mutually abides in their dwellings.\n\nXishan’s Master Zhen said: The sun and Fire are the outer illumination; Metal and Water are the inner illumination—this originates from the *Huainanzi*. The clear and bright belong to the inner illumination of Metal and Water. The turbid and bright belong to the outer illumination of the sun and Fire. Some say: The sun and Fire radiate light externally, thus the sun may be eclipsed and Fire may be extinguished. Metal and Water conceal their light internally, thus they are inexhaustible. By this, one may withdraw the gaze and reverse the hearing, concealing the spirit without display. This principle is wondrous and may be used for nurturing life. Yet in matters of governance, it is irrelevant. How can it compare to we Confucians, who, when it is time to be bright, act as *li* (Fire), and when it is time to be obscure, act as *mingyi* (Darkening)?\n\nIt is further said: Fire and the sun emit light externally, able to extend and bestow without limit. Metal and Water emit light internally, able to receive and adapt, each according to its capacity, to spirit and form. Is this not the Dao of Heaven and Earth?\n\nMaster Zhang said: Fire relies on Wood, and Wood generates Water; spirit rides *qi* and generates essence. In the prior Heaven, spirit generates essence—one gives birth to two. In the posterior Heaven, essence gathers spirit—two gives birth to one.\n\nI have pondered this and say: Water, rooted in yang within yin, is thus lesser yang, aging from spring to summer. Fire, rooted in yin within yang, is thus lesser yin, aging from autumn to winter. *Qian* and *Kun* possess the bodies of *kan* and *li*. *Qian*’s nine-two exchanges with *Kun* to form *kan*. Within *kan*, one yang is born at *zi*, becoming true Water—this is the true yang within yin. *Kun*’s six-two exchanges with *Qian* to form *li*. Within *li*, one yin is born at *wu*, becoming true Fire—this is the true yin within yang. Two are many, one is few—*kan* is one, *li* is two. The few govern, thus the many serve. The few govern, thus *kan* belongs to winter. The years, months, days, and hours it generates, from *zi* to *si*, are all yang. The many serve, thus *li* belongs to summer. The years, months, days, and hours it generates, from *wu* to *hai*, are all yin. Between Heaven and Earth, nowhere is not the function of Water and Fire. Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* entrust their true natures to *kan* and *li*, and *kan* and *li* serve *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nIt is further said: Clouds differ as Water, Fire, Earth, and Stone, and the types of Earth are likewise varied.\n\nMaster Zhang said: Water, Fire, Earth, and Stone are the bodies of Earth; all things possess Earth’s body.\n\nThe Master said: Water rains as drizzle, Fire rains as dew, Earth rains as mist, and Stone rains as hail.",
      "overlap_context": "tumn also belongs to yin. One cannot speak of them in terms of yin-yang mutuality, for Water and Fire have not yet parted from *qi*. At the beginning of yin-yang union, their *qi* naturally possesses the wonder of mutual rooting. Wood is yang’s expansion, and Metal is yin’s contraction—they have fixed substances. This is why they differ from Water and Fire.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Music* tones are Earth, Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire; the *Hong Fan* sequence is Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth.",

The first yang arises as Water, its number one.\nThus, *Qian* is steadfast in the eleventh month, *zi*, and moves left.\nAt the summer solstice, the sun reaches its northern extreme: yin advances as yang retreats.\nSummer is Fire’s position. It should take one yin as Fire’s number, but yin is not called an odd number, so it is paired.\nThus, in the sixth month, the second yin arises as Fire, its number two, and *Kun* is steadfast at *wei* and moves right.\nFrom the winter solstice to the summer solstice, yang advances.\nThus, the first month is established at *yin*.

Spring, with *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*, is Lesser Yang; summer, with *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, is Greater Yang; autumn, with *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, is Lesser Yin; winter, with *you*, *xu*, and *hai*, is Greater Yin.\n\nShao Bowen said: Water, fire, earth, and stone are the fundamental substances, and the Five Phases reside within them. Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are the manifestations of their function, from which the Five Materials emerge. Metal is extracted from stone, and Wood grows from earth. Only after stone exists does Metal come forth; only after earth exists does Wood arise. The Four Symbols and Four Bodies belong to the Prior Heaven. The Five Phases belong to the Posterior Heaven. He also said: The principles of the world are simply one giving rise to two. The *Yi* speaks in terms of eight and stops, while the *Hong Fan* speaks in terms of ten and stops. The trigrams are eight, but the numbers reach ten—eight is the number of yin and yang, while ten is the number of the Five Phases. One yin and one yang make two. Two multiplied by two makes four, and four multiplied by four makes eight. The Five Phases are fundamentally five, yet there are ten because one encompasses two. Wood encompasses *jia* and *yi*; Fire encompasses *bing* and *ding*; Earth encompasses *wu* and *ji*; Metal encompasses *geng* and *xin*; Water encompasses *ren* and *gui*. He also said: *Jia* and *yi* are two Woods, *bing* and *ding* are two Fires, *wu* and *ji* are two Earths, and Metal and Water are likewise. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them results in the mutual overcoming of yin-yang and the Five Phases, which is how they complete one another, and the virtues of the Five Constants are likewise. Nothing is greater than benevolence, the virtue of Wood. If benevolence errs by being too weak, it is cut by righteousness. Righteousness is the virtue of Metal. If righteousness errs by being too rigid, it is moderated by propriety. Propriety is the virtue of Fire. If propriety errs by being too restrictive, it is made flexible by wisdom. Wisdom is the virtue of Water. If wisdom errs by being too cunning, it is corrected by sincerity. The virtues of the Five Constants are the principle of the Five Phases overcoming one another. Old Su’s explanation is correct. Metal overcomes Wood, the hard triumphs over the soft. Water overcomes Fire, the soft triumphs over the hard.\n\nHe also said: There are those that mutually generate. Master Wang said: When Water is said to moisten, Fire is dry; when Earth is said to receive Wood, Metal’s restraint can be known. When Fire is said to flame, Water is cold, and Earth’s steaming, Wood’s warmth, and Metal’s clarity can be known. When Water is said to descend and Fire to ascend, Wood’s left, Metal’s right, and Earth’s center can be known. When Wood is said to be curved and straight, Earth’s roundness, Metal’s squareness, Fire’s sharpness, and Water’s levelness can be known. When Metal is said to be malleable and transformative, Wood’s change, Earth’s transformation, Water’s compliance, and Fire’s alteration can be known. When Earth is said to sow and reap, wells and ditches, cooking with Fire, implements of Wood and Metal can be known. What is meant by Wood’s change? It becomes bright as Fire and mottled as Earth. What is meant by Earth’s transformation? It can dry and moisten, spread and restrain. What is meant by Water’s compliance? It becomes sweet when sweet, bitter when bitter, green when green, white when white. What is meant by Fire’s alteration? It transforms the raw into the cooked, the soft into the hard, the hard into the soft. Metal can also transform—it can be round, level, sharp, curved, or straight. Yet without Fire’s alteration, it cannot transform itself, hence it is called malleable and transformative.\n\nHe also said: Those who obtain the essence of the Five Phases become humans—one speaks only of the Five Phases, not of yin and yang. To become human, one must have the Five Phases. The Five Phases are one yin and yang; apart from the Five Phases, there is no place to seek yin and yang. For example, *jia* Wood is yang, and *yi* Wood is yin. Master Zhu said: Numbers are merely the calculations of *qi*’s seasonal nodes; in general, they are simply one yin and yang. Dispersed, they become the Five Phases, and each of the Five Phases has its own yin and yang. *Jia* and *yi* are Wood, *bing* and *ding* are Fire; spring Wood and summer Fire, years, months, days, and hours—none are beyond the *qi* of the Five Phases. *Jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding* are also yin and yang, merely the *qi* of two and five. Humans are born when they encounter this *qi*, which varies unevenly, determining nobility or baseness, longevity or early death. When sages and worthies are above, their *qi* is harmonious. Otherwise, the *qi* is biased. Among the Five Phases, some obtain clear *qi*—they are intelligent but lack fortune and emolument. Some obtain turbid *qi*—they have fortune and emolument but lack wisdom. All is determined by their *qi* and fate. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Zhou, and the Duke of Shao obtained the correct *qi*; Confucius, Mencius, and the Qi and Lu schools obtained the biased *qi*. During the Five Dynasties, when chaos was extreme, many sages and worthies were born, as in the time of our ancestors. It was like waking from a deep sleep, refreshed and full of spirit.\n\nThe Five Phases have principle, *qi*, and number, and they operate within the ten celestial stems and twelve earthly branches. Their numbers can be calculated: Heaven One and Earth Six combine to generate and complete Water, residing in the north. *Zi* is number one, *hai* is number six; *ren* is yang Water, one, and *gui* is yin Water, six. Earth Two and Heaven Seven combine to generate and complete Fire, residing in the south. *Si* is number two, *wu* is number seven; *bing* is yang Fire, seven, and *ding* is yin Fire, two. Heaven Three and Earth Eight generate and complete Wood, residing in the east.",

      "translated_text": "Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai, collated by Fang Hui Wangu of Xugu, and proofread by Wanli\n\n*On Observing Images*\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"The Two Modes generate the Four Images.\" It further says: \"The Four Images are for demonstration.\" From Wang Fuxi to Cheng Yi, their explanations differ in many ways. Only Master Shao transmitted the learning of the Primordial Heaven, and at a single glance, its sequence could dispel a millennium of confusion. Master Zhu’s *Initiation into Learning* elucidates this most thoroughly, though some may not yet fully grasp it. I say: If you comprehend those eight characters within, then this entire scroll becomes but a fishing net and rabbit snare—what need is there for further words? Let those with insight inscribe this.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of the heavenly numbers as five and the earthly numbers as five. Retain one as the root and employ four for transformation. Applied to divination, these become the days of seven, eight, nine, and six. Applied to earth, they become water, fire, soil, and stone. Applied to observing celestial images, they become the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Within the hexagrams, they divide into eight. The difference lies merely in the specific referents.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Of all things, none are greater than Heaven and Earth. The vastness of Heaven is exhausted by yin and yang; the vastness of Earth is exhausted by hardness and softness. Yin and yang exhaust themselves to form the four seasons; hardness and softness exhaust themselves to form the four directions. Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. Heaven and Earth are but the greatest of things. Heaven is nothing more than the waxing and waning of one yin and one yang, the alternation of one cold and one heat to form the four seasons—this is the Dao of Heaven. Earth is nothing more than the interweaving of one hardness and one softness, the alternation of one level and one perilous terrain to form the four directions—this is the principle of Earth. Manifested in Heaven as the Four Images, arrayed in the year as the four seasons, shaped on Earth as the four bodies, and distributed in the directions as the four quarters, all are brought forth by the two things of Qian-yang and Kun-yin.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"The Four Images refer to yin, yang, hardness, and softness. Yin and yang generate Heaven; hardness and softness generate Earth.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Master Shao’s explanation of numbers also begins with one yin and one yang. He divides yin and yang into greater and lesser, forming the Four Images of Qian. He divides hardness and softness into greater and lesser, forming the Four Images of Earth. Yin intermingles with yang, and yang intermingles with yin, generating the Four Images of Heaven. The so-called Four Images are: Heaven possesses yin and yang, and within these, it further divides into Greater Yang, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, and Lesser Yin. The Four Images of Heaven are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Earth possesses hardness and softness, and within these, it further divides into Greater Hardness, Greater Softness, Lesser Hardness, and Lesser Softness. The Four Images of Earth are water, fire, soil, and stone. In truth, originally there was only one Supreme Ultimate. One divides into two, two into four, and four into eight. Heaven receives one set of four, and Earth receives one set of four. Each has one Supreme Ultimate operating within it, which is merely the doubling of the Five Phases.\"\n\nThe sun and moon constitute the *Changes*. The character *yi* (易) is composed of \"sun\" above as yang and \"moon\" below as yin. Thus, Zhuangzi said: \"The *Changes* is for guiding yin and yang.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Greater Yang is the sun; Greater Yin is the moon; Lesser Yang is the stars; Lesser Yin is the constellations. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations intermingle to exhaust the body of Heaven. Greater Softness is water; Greater Hardness is fire; Lesser Softness is soil; Lesser Hardness is stone. Water, fire, soil, and stone intermingle to exhaust the body of Earth.\"\n\nShao Botian said: \"*The Supreme Principle Governing the World* abandons metal, wood, water, fire, and soil, using instead water, fire, soil, and stone—why? The sun, moon, stars, and constellations are the Four Images of Heaven; water, fire, soil, and stone are the Four Bodies of Earth. Metal, wood, water, fire, and soil are called the Five Phases. The Four Images and Four Bodies belong to the Primordial Heaven; the Five Phases belong to the Manifested Heaven. The Primordial Heaven is that from which the Manifested Heaven emerges. Water, fire, soil, and stone are that from which the Five Phases emerge. Metal arises from stone; wood grows from soil. The Five Phases operate between Heaven and Earth, and within them lie water, fire, soil, and stone. *The Supreme Principle Governing the World* uses water, fire, soil, and stone to represent the fundamental body; the *Great Plan* uses water, fire, wood, metal, and soil to represent their application.\"\n\nThe sun is the essence of yang. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Qian represents the sun, and Qian’s position is due south. The moon is the essence of yin. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Dui represents the moon, and Dui’s position is southeast. Lesser Yang as stars belongs to Li, positioned due east. Lesser Yin as constellations belongs to Zhen, positioned northeast. Greater Softness as water resembles the moon. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Kun represents water, positioned due north. Greater Hardness as fire resembles the sun. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Gen represents fire, positioned northwest. Lesser Softness as soil resembles the constellations. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Kan represents soil, positioned due west. Lesser Hardness as stone resembles the stars. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*, Xun represents stone, positioned southwest.\n\nThe sun is yang; the moon is yin; the stars are hard; the constellations are soft—Heaven contains Earth. Water is yin; fire is yang; soil is soft; stone is hard—Earth contains Heaven. In Heaven, it forms images as the sun; on Earth, it forms shapes as fire. Fire and the sun are fundamentally one body, thus the yang-burning mirror obtains fire from the sun. In Heaven, it forms images as the moon; on Earth, it forms shapes as water. Water and the moon are fundamentally one body, thus the square vessel obtains water from the moon. In Heaven, it forms images as stars; on Earth, it forms shapes as stone. Stone and stars are fundamentally one body, thus tradition speaks of stars falling as stone. In Heaven, it forms images as constellations; on Earth, it forms shapes as soil. The constellations and soil are fundamentally one body, thus beyond the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, what is lofty and azure is all constellations. Beyond water, fire, soil, and stone, what is vast and boundless is all soil.\n\nNow, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are like a person’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. Water, fire, soil, and stone are like a person’s blood, qi, bones, and flesh. Thus, they are called the body of Heaven and Earth.",

Among humans, the enlightened are the wise; among flying creatures, the phoenix and the luan; among running creatures, the qilin; among shelled creatures, the tortoise and the dragon; among grasses, the lingzhi and the orchid; among trees, the pine and the cypress; among stones, gold and jade.\n\nHeaven also possesses the most extreme violence; Earth also possesses the deepest obscurity. Among humans, the malevolent become omens; among flying creatures, the owl and the shrike; among running creatures, the tiger and the wolf; among shelled creatures, the venomous snake; among grasses, the poisonous herbs; among trees, the parasitic mistletoe; among stones, the harsh and the brittle.\n\nWhere there is number, there are things; when number is exhausted, things come to an end. Where there are things, there is number; when things come to an end, number is exhausted. Heaven and Earth give birth to things, each distinct and different, and thus their mutual stimulation and intermingling give rise to transformation.\n\nMaster Shao said: The sun begins with one; the moon begins with two; the year begins with three; the constellations begin with four. One is the primordial unity; two is the twelve celestial meetings; three is the three hundred sixty days; four is the four thousand three hundred twenty hours—this refers to a single year.\n\nIt is further said: The sun follows Heaven in its turning; the moon follows the sun in its movement; the stars appear following the moon. Thus, the stars follow the law of the moon; the moon follows the law of the sun; the sun follows the law of Heaven. Heaven is half bright and half dark; the sun is half full and half waning; the moon is half full and half deficient; the stars are half moving and half still—this is the principle of yin and yang.\n\nThough the sun moves to the right, it still turns left with Heaven. Though the moon moves swiftly, it meets the sun and conjoins with it, always remaining behind. The stars follow the moon because they appear at night.\n\nWhat is called the Dao consists of the alternation of yin and yang. Heaven follows the Dao, thus it is half bright and half dark. The sun follows Heaven, thus it is half full and half waning. The moon follows the sun, thus it is half full and half deficient. The stars follow the moon, thus they are half moving and half still.\n\nWhere there is one, there is also two; solitary yin or solitary yang cannot stand alone. The sun’s half-full, half-waning state means it is full when in the yang degrees and waning when in the yin degrees. The stars’ half-moving, half-still state means they move when among the wandering stars and are still when among the fixed stars.\n\nMaster Cai said: The sun is the regular celestial cycles; the moon determines the new and full moons; the stars are the fixed and wandering stars. The constellations are the twelve celestial divisions where the sun and moon conjoin.\n\nIt is further said: Heaven is constantly visible day and night. The sun appears by day, the moon by night, but each is half invisible. The stars are half visible at night—this is the hierarchy of nobility and baseness. Though Heaven is half dark and half bright, it is constantly visible day and night. The sun is in the sky during the day, while the moon is beneath the earth at night, thus it is half invisible. The stars are even less visible than the moon—this is the distinction of nobility and baseness. The superior encompasses the inferior; the great contains the small. The stars are half visible because the five planets and the twenty-eight lunar lodges appear in alternation.\n\nIt is further said: The moon can be seen by day, thus it is yin within yang. The stars can be seen by night, thus they are yang within yin. In the *Xiantian* system, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations correspond to Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen. The sun is yang within yang; the moon is yin within yang; the stars are yang within yin; the constellations are yin within yin. The moon can be seen by day, thus it is yin within yang. The stars can be seen by night, thus they are yang within yin. The stars also follow the moon, thus they are interwoven and mutually employed. The constellations are invisible, thus they are yin within yin. The constellations are Heaven, upon which the sun, moon, and stars are borne. Though the constellations are invisible, Heaven is visible day and night, thus the constellations are not used as one but are the foundation of what is used.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The Two Modes begin with one day to divide yin and yang and the Four Images. Next comes two days to divide the greater and lesser. The Two Modes are one line for yin and one line for yang. Adding one odd and one even line above each yields two lines. Four is called the Four Images, whose positions are: Greater Yang as one, Lesser Yin as two, Lesser Yang as three, Greater Yin as four. Their numbers are: Greater Yang as nine, Lesser Yin as eight, Lesser Yang as seven, Greater Yin as six. Thus, one, two, three, four contain nine, eight, seven, six.\n\nAccording to the *River Chart*, six is one added to five; seven is two added to five; eight is three added to five; nine is four added to five. According to the *Luo Writing*, nine is the remainder of one part in ten; eight is the remainder of two parts in ten; six is the remainder of four parts in ten.",
      "overlap_context": "ions; on Earth, it forms shapes as soil. The constellations and soil are fundamentally one body, thus beyond the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, what is lofty and azure is all constellations. Beyond water, fire, soil, and stone, what is vast and boundless is all soil.\n\nNow, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are like a person’s ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. Water, fire, soil, and stone are like a person’s blood, qi, bones, and flesh. Thus, they are called the body of Heaven and Earth.",

      "translated_text": "Master Zhou Dunyi referred to them as Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. Master Shao Yong spoke of dividing two into four, where above the Four Images, each generates one odd and one even line. Thus, three lines yield eight, and with the Three Powers thus outlined, the eight trigrams emerge in name. Their positions are: Qian as one, Dui as two, Li as three, Zhen as four, Xun as five, Kan as six, Gen as seven, and Kun as eight.\n\nSome have questioned the Four Images in the *Book of Changes*. Kong Yingda of the Tang identified them as Metal, Wood, Water, and Fire, while Zhuang of the Song saw them as the Image of Substance, the Image of Meaning, and the Image of Function. Those who speak of seven, eight, nine, and six do not directly equate them with yin and yang in their elder and younger forms. Master Zhang Zai said: the Dragon, Tiger, Quail, and Tortoise—Qian’s four virtues correspond to the four seasons. Zhu Zifa remarked: the four cardinal directions and four intercardinal points—none of the Confucians regarded these as the Four Images of Heaven. Yet the Master’s lines seem to differ from Master Zhu Xi’s sequence in drawing the trigrams.\n\nThis humble one says: Master Zhu Xi’s words are rooted in Master Shao Yong’s teachings on the Primordial Heaven, though earlier scholars did not elaborate on this. The Primordial Heaven encompasses all, for the Four Images are present everywhere. In the *Book of Changes*, they are seven, eight, nine, and six; in Heaven, they are the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Elder yin transforms into younger yang, and elder yang transforms into younger yin. Younger yin and younger yang do not transform—they await the transformation of elder yin and elder yang. Tracing this back to antiquity, one may discern the omens of fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation, advance and retreat, preservation and demise.\n\nThe sun, as Greater Yang, undergoes the changes of cold and heat, day and night. The stars, as Lesser Yang, share the sun’s light but show no change in form. The moon, as Greater Yin, undergoes the changes of new moon, crescent, half-moon, and full moon. The constellations, as Lesser Yin, form the body of Heaven and show no change in shape. The celestial images in Heaven are the manifest line-images. The hexagrams and lines in the *Book of Changes* are the concealed celestial images. Fu Xi gazed upon the celestial images to draw the eight trigrams. The Master gazed upon the celestial patterns to understand the hidden and the manifest—all may be unified as one.

      "translated_text": "The *Discourse on the Trigrams* states: \"Li represents the sun and fire.\"\n\nThe Tang scholar Kong [Yingda] said: The sun moves by taking the southern quarter. The accumulated heat of yang qi generates fire. The essence of fire qi becomes the sun. Fire has no form, yet when it attaches to things, it takes form. Born of earth, it rules as one of the two sovereigns in the south. Its spirit in Heaven is the sun, and on earth, it is fire.\n\nHu [Yuan] said: The sun’s body is Li, yin in structure yet yang in function. Being yin in structure, its movement is unhurried; being yang in function, it shines brightly by day. The *Canon of Yao* states: \"At the solstice, the day is longest; at the equinox, the night is shortest.\" This refers to the four cardinal days. The *Monthly Ordinances* states: \"Its days are jia and yi; its days are bing and ding; its days are wu and ji; its days are geng and xin; its days are ren and gui.\" This refers to the days of the four seasons.\n\nThis fool says: When the sun is at *zi*, it rises at midnight. As it ascends, it turns toward life, and the world grows bright. When the sun is at *wu*, it begins to descend after noon. As it descends, it turns toward death, and all things become ghosts. The mechanism of ghosts and spirits lies solely in ascent and descent.\n\nThe *Yuanming Bao* states: The sun’s form is round, and when viewed from afar, it spans the heavens, corresponding to a thousand *li*. Thus, the royal domain mirrors it.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Heaven, earth, sun, and moon are one. The moon receives the sun’s light, yet the sun is not diminished. Nevertheless, the moon’s light is the sun’s light.\n\nMaster Shao said: Yang embracing yin becomes (the sun, yang within yang). Master Zhu said: \"Ceaseless activity\" describes the sun and moon, while \"the coming and going of cold and heat\" describes their function. Substance and function are inseparable; one cannot speak of them as prior or posterior.\n\nHeaven envelops earth externally. Earth’s form is small, while the sun’s light is vast, illuminating from all four sides. When the moon is in the center of the sky, it receives the sun’s light and becomes full. When the moon is far from the sun, its light waxes; when near, its light wanes.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: Heaven and earth interact through Kan and Li. Speaking of the sun, when the sun descends, the moon ascends; speaking of the moon, when the sun conjoins, the moon unites; speaking of the year, when cold comes, heat departs—all are instances of *jiji* (Completion). Kan above and Li below represent the extremes of water and fire. When they revert to their origins, within the extreme of *jiji* lies *weiji* (Incompletion).\n\nHan scholar Zhang Heng said: The sun is the ancestor of yang essence, accumulating to form the crow. It has three talons, for yang numbers are odd. The rooster belongs to *you*, yin within yang, and the central void of Li harbors fire qi. He also said: The moon is the center of yin essence, accumulating to form the hare. Yin numbers are even, and it belongs to *mao*. It is yang within yin, the fullness of Kan, where the water qi of Heavenly One resides.\n\nJin scholar Du Yu said: The sun’s substance is red, the moon’s substance is white. The *Yuanming Bao* states: The word for sun (*ri*) means \"fullness.\" It is the great brilliance, the fullness of light. The sun is the image of the ruler; when he travels through a land governed by the Dao, it shines brightly. When the sun displays five colors, his governance is at peace.\n\nMaster Shao said: In summer, the sun follows the Dipper northward; in winter, it follows the Dipper southward. At the summer solstice, heat reaches its extreme, and the sun thereafter follows the Dipper north. At the winter solstice, cold reaches its extreme, and the sun thereafter follows the Dipper south.\n\nThis fool once pondered Master Shao’s words, wondering if they accord with the teachings of the *Tai Xuan*. Let me set them forth in order. It says: When the sun moves slightly south, all things die; when the sun grows strong, all things live. At the summer solstice, the sun is in *Jing* (Well); the sun reaches the southern limit, and the host of yin gradually grows, so all things turn toward death. After the winter solstice, the sun is in *Qianniu* (Oxherd); it returns to the northern path, and the host of yang gradually grows, so all things turn toward life.\n\nThe *Xuan* also says: When the Dipper moves slightly north, all things are empty; when the Dipper moves slightly south, all things are full. After the Beginning of Winter, the Dipper’s handle points to *hai*, and yin qi conceals things, so the day is empty. At the Beginning of Summer, it points to *si*, and yang qi brings forth things, so the day is full.\n\nIt further says: When the sun moves south, it travels leftward yet rotates rightward. When the Dipper moves south, it travels rightward yet rotates leftward. The sun moves rightward against the heavens. In spring, it begins its journey, passing through the seven stars from the west to the south, hence it is said to travel rightward. In autumn, it returns, passing through the seven stars from the east to the north, hence it is said to rotate leftward. The Dipper follows the heavens leftward. In spring, it points east, passing through three celestial markers to the south, beginning from the east, hence it is said to travel leftward. In autumn, it points west, passing through two celestial markers to the north, returning from the west, hence it is said to rotate rightward.\n\nIt further says: The winter solstice and the time after midnight are images of approaching the Mystery. At the winter solstice, the Dipper points to *zi*; at midnight, it aligns with *zi*, signifying progression without reaching the extreme, advance without arrival, emptiness without fullness. At this time, the celestial Dao moves leftward, and the Dipper’s handle follows the heavens leftward. Though the sun moves rightward against the heavens, whenever it meets the moon, it aligns with the Dipper’s handle. The *Xuan* hexagrams, from *Zhong* (Center) to *Ying* (Response), number forty-one, with the odd as primary. In one hundred eighty-two and a half days, the sun moves through them—this is yang moving within yang. Moving through yang degrees, it waxes until *si*, completing *Qian* and giving birth to things.\n\nThe summer solstice and the time after noon are images of receding from the Mystery. At the summer solstice, the Dipper points to *wu*; at noon, it aligns with *wu*, signifying progression to the extreme and then retreat, advance to the limit and then return, fullness and then diminution. At this time, the celestial Dao turns rightward, and the Dipper’s handle also follows the heavens rightward. Though the sun moves leftward against the heavens, whenever it meets the moon, it aligns with the Dipper’s rightward pointing. The *Xuan* hexagrams, from *Ying* (Welcome) to *Yang* (Nourishment), number forty, with yin and even numbers in operation. In one hundred eighty-two days, this is yin moving within yin. The sun moves through yin degrees, waning until *hai*, completing *Kun* and storing away all things.\n\nSouth and north are the fixed positions of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the warp. East and west are the flowing qi of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the weft. In Heaven, the sun divides day and night in a single day, and south and north in a single year; for the myriad things, it divides life and death. #2",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: when yang arrives, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. The annotation states: the preceding text accounts for three hundred sixty-four and a half days, and adding the two *zàn* of *qíshū* completes one day, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and twenty-three parts. The twenty parts within a single day yield three seasons, forming three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter degrees.\n\nAs the *Han shang* records: Liu Zhao states that the sun’s passage through the northern *lu* is winter, the western *lu* is spring, the southern *lu* is summer, and the eastern *lu* is autumn. Common discourse rightly accepts the southern and northern *lu*, but regarding the eastern and western *lu*, it is either mistaken or doubtful. The *Sui Treatise* states that the eastern *lu* is spring and the western *lu* is autumn. This requires further examination and cannot be conflated.\n\nFor south and north serve as the warp, with *zǐ* and *wǔ* in opposition. At winter solstice, the first yang arises at *zǐ*, where the numinous and the reasoned unite heaven and earth to initiate the year’s transformations. The sun, moon, stars, and Dipper all begin here. Thus it is said: traversing the northern *lu* is winter; traversing the southern *lu* is summer. Direction and season cannot be altered.\n\nFrom this, heaven turns from north to east, rotating leftward to generate all things. The sun, however, moves from north to west, turning rightward to serve as the weft. In early spring, the sun resides in *Yingshi*, a northern constellation—this is the first month, *jiàn yín*, meeting at *Kèzī*’s *hài*. In mid-spring, the sun is in *Kui*, a western constellation—second month, *jiàn mǎo*, meeting at *Jiànglóu*’s *xū*. In late spring, the sun is in *Wèi*—third month, *jiàn chén*, meeting at *Dàliáng*’s *yǒu*. Weaving west to east, it is thus said: the sun’s passage through the western *lu* is called spring.\n\nBy the fourth month, *sì* aligns with *shēn*, meeting at *Shíshěn*. The sun traverses the southern *lu*, and at *wǔ*, the first yin arises, as creation gathers its work and restrains the myriad things. Here, the Way of Heaven turns from south to north, rotating rightward from the west to complete all things. The sun then moves from south to east, traveling leftward to serve as the weft. In early autumn, the sun is in *Yì*, where *shēn* aligns with *sì*, called *Chúnwěi*. In mid-autumn, the sun is in *Jiǎo*, where *yǒu* aligns with *chén*, called *Shòuxīng*. In late autumn, the sun is in *Fáng*, where *xū* aligns with *mǎo*, called *Dàhuǒ*. Weaving east to west, it is thus said: the sun’s passage through the eastern *lu* is called autumn.\n\nThe reason spring is not called the eastern *lu* and autumn not the western *lu* is to show that the warp of south and north cannot change, while the weft of east and west mutually complement one another.\n\nThe sun is yang, and when yang governs, it rises from east to midnight, advancing southward. As the sun progresses northward, daylight lengthens, and yang’s advance brings warmth and heat. When yin governs, it rises from summer solstice to noon, advancing northward. As the sun retreats southward, daylight shortens, and yin’s dominance brings cold and coolness. Between the two solstices, the Way is balanced and shadows align—here lie the spring and autumn equinoxes.\n\nThe sun has its central path, while the moon has its nine courses. At new moon, the *lu*’s passage nears its node, and deficiency arises, giving rise to cold and warmth. At winter solstice, the sun reaches its southern extreme, and the shadow lengthens; if it does not reach its extreme, warmth becomes harmful. At summer solstice, the sun reaches its northern extreme, and the shadow shortens; if it does not reach its extreme, cold becomes harmful.\n\nShao Yong said: Heaven’s movement creates day and night; the sun’s movement creates cold and heat. Summer is shallow, winter is deep—this is the union of heaven and earth. Leftward rotation and rightward movement are the union of heaven and sun. Heaven completes one revolution in a day. The sun moves one degree, carried by heaven’s turning, following it. In summer, it rises at *yín* and sets at *xū*; in winter, it rises at *chén* and sets at *shēn*; in spring and autumn, it rises at *mǎo* and sets at *yǒu*. Rising marks day, setting marks night—though dependent on the sun’s rising and setting, its movement is governed by heaven.\n\nWhen the sun is beneath the earth, it is cold; when it is above, it is hot. Traversing the northern *lu* in winter brings cold, as the sun travels deep beneath the earth. Traversing the southern *lu* in summer brings heat, as the sun travels shallow beneath the earth. Traversing the western *lu* in spring and the eastern *lu* in autumn brings the mean of cold and heat.\n\nThe sun’s movement creates cold and heat. As the Way of Heaven turns south, it moves from deep to shallow; as it turns north, it moves from shallow to deep—this is the union of heaven and earth. Some say: in summer, the southern pole is upright; in winter, the southern pole is inclined, likening it to a person’s head to explain the shallow and deep—this fails to account for the sun’s ecliptic.\n\nAt summer solstice, the sun is at *wǔ* and aligns with *wǔ*; at winter solstice, the sun is at *zǐ* and aligns with *zǐ*, following heaven’s movement. Thus, depth and shallowness mark the union of heaven and earth. At winter solstice, the sun rises, and *Xīngjì* moves rightward as the sun shifts one degree. Heaven rotates leftward one revolution and passes ten degrees, while the sun traverses the six *jiǎ* and meets the Dipper—this is the union of heaven and sun.\n\nThe night of winter solstice is like the day of summer solstice; the night of summer solstice is like the day of winter solstice. Winter’s night is only like the day of spring and autumn, as daylight encroaches upon night by five *kè*. The sun rises at its usual time, yet dawn appears two and a half *kè* before its rising, and dusk lingers two and a half *kè* after its setting.\n\nIt is also said: rising in the east and setting in the west follows heaven’s movement. Summer in the north and winter in the south follow heaven’s union. Heaven completes one revolution, surpassing one star, corresponding to the sun’s movement. Spring aligns with *yǒu*, summer with *wǔ*, autumn with *mǎo*, and winter with *zǐ*, corresponding to the sun’s union.\n\nAt winter solstice midnight, *zǐ*, the sun rises at *Xīngjì*. The sun moves rightward one degree, and heaven shifts leftward one degree, so the sun remains at midnight. Thus, it rises in the east and sets in the west—this is heaven’s movement, not the sun’s.\n\nIn summer, the sun’s path follows the northernmost point; in winter, it follows the southernmost. When the sun is farthest north, it is closest to the pole, so shadows are short and days are long. When the sun is farthest south, it is farthest from the pole, so shadows are long and days are short. This follows heaven’s union.\n\nThe sun moves one degree each day, and heaven completes one revolution, surpassing one degree.",
      "overlap_context": " operation. In one hundred eighty-two days, this is yin moving within yin. The sun moves through yin degrees, waning until *hai*, completing *Kun* and storing away all things.\n\nSouth and north are the fixed positions of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the warp. East and west are the flowing qi of yin and yang, hence the sun serves as the weft. In Heaven, the sun divides day and night in a single day, and south and north in a single year; for the myriad things, it divides life and death. #2",

      "translated_text": "Each \"degree\" refers to a degree of the stars, thus corresponding to the sun’s movement. At winter solstice, the sun is at *zǐ*; at summer solstice, at *wǔ*; at spring equinox, at *yǒu*; and at autumn equinox, at *mǎo*—this is heaven’s shifting. At winter solstice midnight, the sun aligns with *zǐ*; at summer solstice noon, it aligns with *wǔ*; at the spring and autumn equinoxes, it aligns either with *yǒu* or *mǎo*. East and west alternate in their weft, forming the intersection of yin and yang in spring and summer—this corresponds to the sun’s union.\n\nI have examined ancient records: at winter solstice, the sun is at the first degree of *Qiānniú*; at spring equinox, at the fourth degree of *Lóu*; at summer solstice, at the twenty-first degree of *Dōngjǐng*; and at autumn equinox, at the tenth degree of *Jiǎo*. The *Suí Treatise* states: when the sun is closest to the pole, shadows are short and days are long—this describes the summer solstice. When the sun follows the inner path and is nearest the pole, daylight is at its longest. An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of one foot and five inches. At spring equinox in *Lóu* and autumn equinox in *Jiǎo*, day and night are equal. Thus, an eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of seven feet and five inches. The *Suí Treatise* further states: when the sun is farthest from the pole, shadows are long and days are short—this describes the winter solstice. When the sun follows the outer path and is farthest from the pole, daylight is at its shortest. An eight-foot gnomon casts a shadow of thirteen feet. Subtracting one foot and five inches leaves a remaining shadow of eleven feet and five inches—this is the shadow’s variation between winter and summer. Hence it is said: the sun has a central path. North to *Qiānniú*, closest to the pole, marks the summer solstice. South to *Qiānniú*, farthest from the pole, marks the winter solstice. *Jiǎo* in the east and *Lóu* in the west lie at a median distance from the pole. Thus, south to *Jiǎo* and east to *Lóu* mark the spring and autumn equinoxes.\n\nMaster Zhèng says: at spring equinox, the sun is in *Lóu*, the moon’s first quarter appears at *Dōngjǐng*, its full phase at *Jiǎo*, and its last quarter at *Qiānniú*. At autumn equinox, the sun is in *Jiǎo*, the moon’s first quarter appears at *Qiānniú*, its full phase at *Lóu*, and its last quarter at *Dōngjǐng*. This also determines whether the qi has arrived by observing the shadows. When the qi of spring, autumn, winter, and summer all arrive, the four seasons proceed in proper order. The solstices mark the sun’s true position. Thus, at the extremes of length and shortness, governance reaches its peak and the qi arrives. Winter has no excess yang, summer no hidden yin. At the solstices, when the midday shadow matches the expected measure, the year will be prosperous and the people harmonious. If it does not match, the year will be harsh and the people deceitful. When the ruler’s governance and teachings are proper, the four seasons’ shadows follow the expected measure.\n\nIf the shadow advances, there will be floods—meaning the shadow is longer than expected. When the sun’s path lies outside the ecliptic, the shadow lengthens. A long shadow indicates yin’s dominance, hence floods. If the shadow retreats, there will be drought—meaning the shadow is shorter than expected. When the sun’s path enters within the ecliptic, the shadow shortens. A short shadow indicates yang’s dominance, hence drought. An advance of one foot and two inches in the shadow foretells a lunar eclipse, for the moon’s number is twelve. A retreat of one foot and two inches foretells a solar eclipse, for the sun’s number is ten. Shadow advance is surplus; shadow retreat is deficiency—this also determines whether the qi has arrived by observing the shadows.\n\nIt is further said: when the sage observes the movements of the sun and moon and pairs them with *kǎn* and *lí*, the meaning of the Eight Trigrams becomes manifest. The *Appended Judgments* states: \"Displaying images and revealing brightness, nothing is greater than the sun and moon.\" Master Zhū says: as in the *nà jiǎ* method, *kǎn* corresponds to *wù*, *lí* to *jǐ*. One line of *qián* belongs to *wù*, one line of *kūn* to *jǐ*. Only when *wù* remains with *jǐ* do *kǎn* and *lí* form. For *qián* and *kūn* are the great parents, while *kǎn* and *lí* are the lesser parents.\n\nHànshàng says: Yú observed the sun and moon suspended in heaven to form the images of the Eight Trigrams. At dusk and dawn, the *kǎn* image appears, water flowing to *wù*. At noon, the *lí* image appears, fire conjoining *jǐ* to complete *wù*. The position of *jǐ* earth is the central image, manifest in the midst of sun and moon mutually hastening to generate brightness. When the second and fifth lines of *qián* and *kūn* intersect, *kǎn* and *lí* are born, and the sun and moon emerge. On the third day, the *zhèn* image appears, the moon emerging at *gēng*. On the eighth day, the *duì* image appears, the moon visible at *dīng*. On the fifteenth day, the *qián* image appears, the moon full at *jiǎ* and *rén*. On the sixteenth day, the *xùn* image appears, the moon waning at *xīn*. On the twenty-third day, the *gèn* image appears, the moon diminishing at *bǐng*. On the thirtieth day, the *kūn* image appears, the moon extinguished at *yǐ*. Taken together, *kǎn* and *lí* are the sun and moon, generating brightness at *zhèn*, generating darkness at *xùn*, waxing at *duì*, waning at *gèn*, full at *qián*, and extinguished at *kūn*. The ten days from *jiǎ* to *guǐ* are contained within the Eight Trigrams.\n\nThe *Records* state: \"Great brightness is born in the east, the moon is born in the west.\" The *Book of Songs* says: \"The sun of the east, the moon of the east.\" The moon’s beginning is born in the west, its fullness in the east. The sun’s rising place is in the east. Before dawn, it has already traveled beneath the earth, merely not yet emerged above it. The ancients explained the character for \"sun\" as *shí* (real), and for \"moon\" as *quē* (deficient). The sun is always thus real. Heaven’s movement has discrepancies, and the sun, moon, and stars are slower, unable to keep pace. Only the sun’s movement is fixed and unchanging, hence it is called *shí* (real).\n\nIt is further said: heaven and earth’s great awakening lies in summer, while human spirit resides in the union of the heart. At noon, the sun follows heaven to the south; at midnight, it follows heaven to the north—this is the awakening and sleeping of a single day. In summer, the sun aligns with noon; in winter, it aligns with midnight—this is the awakening and sleeping of a year. Thus, in summer, the vast sky is *lí*, the trigram of all things meeting. The sun is heaven’s spirit. Human spirit: by day, it resides in the heart—this is summer; by night, in the kidneys—this is winter. Day corresponds to night, the hidden storehouse. The *Mysterious* states: \"Conceal the heart in the abyss, and the spirit will not stray.\" This means dwelling the heart in the qi’s viscera to preserve the spirit. Heaven and earth’s union is three-tenths. At summer solstice’s day, the sun is seven-tenths above heaven; at winter solstice’s night, it is seven-tenths below the earth.",

      "translated_text": "Each night, the sun of heaven circles once beneath the earth, passing through one degree. The qi of Heavenly One generates water, which benefits the myriad things. The sun, as the essence of yang, can also dry the water beneath the earth, preventing it from harming the myriad things. How could mere \"soaking of scorched tails\" ever drain it? The spirit of Heavenly One is the mother of qi. When clouds arise, waters surge, and mists swirl, the ceaseless revolution of day and night causes water droplets to flow forth. If water were to swell unchecked by the sun’s drying power, mountains would burst, and timely rains would descend upon heaven and earth. Yin and yang naturally contain abundant qi. When excessive, it pours down in torrents, drowning the people below in darkness and deluge.\n\nHistorical records speak of ten suns appearing in the time of Yao, though this is hardly credible. Yet heaven’s compassion for the people below is a valid principle. The sun, though fiery, regularly brightens the world, advancing and retreating in due measure. As the *Yi* says: \"Brightness enters the earth and turns.\" Heaven abides in water, as in the hexagram *Xu*. The sun is yang, and water is yin; yin qi disperses without fail, and water qi dissipates without exception. When the sun emerges, it becomes day within the cosmos—this is the true course of heaven’s movement. Such is the intent of creation to uphold yang.\n\nThus, the celestial body is perfectly round, encircling the heavens like an inner enclosure. The moon, being water, waxes and wanes, for it is said that Heavenly One generates water. Each day, the sun ascends in heaven while simultaneously circling beneath the earth, as evidenced by the tides. In the hexagram *Ming Yi*, the sun enters beneath the earth, becoming night. How could there be a single day without the image of yang brightness?\n\nThe *Sui Dynasty’s Treatise on Astronomy* states: \"The sun dries water to its utmost.\" It also says: \"Heaven has two paths: the yellow and the red.\" Shen Cunzhong remarked: \"Astronomers speak of ten colors to record the movements of the sun and moon.\" The celestial body is perfectly round, like two lids joined together. The celestial equator lies horizontally at their juncture. North of the equator, it resembles an inverted lid; south of it, like an outer enclosure or an upturned lid. Both use the center of the diagram as their pole. North of the celestial equator lies the North Pole; south of it, the South Pole.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The ecliptic is where the two halves of the celestial sphere join, at the center of heaven.\" He also said: \"The celestial equator lies precisely at heaven’s center, like the seam of a joined box. The ecliptic crosses transversely through the celestial equator.\" Further, he stated: \"Half of the celestial equator lies within the ecliptic, and half outside. At two points east and west, they intersect, dividing the heavens into degrees. When they meet, it is at the crossroads of the ecliptic and celestial equator.\" At the full moon, the moon and sun face each other directly, as if one were at *zi* and the other at *wu*, sharing the same degree. For instance, if the moon is at *Bi* 11°, the sun is also at that degree, though they face north and south. The reason the sun is eclipsed at the new moon is that the moon is always below, and the sun above. When they meet, the moon obscures the sun from below. Thus, it is said: \"At the full moon, the moon is eclipsed, for yin dares to contend with yang.\"\n\nThe sun has a central path, called the ecliptic. Some say: \"The central earth of *wu* and *ji* corresponds to the stars, and the four seasons have four movements: spring west, autumn east, summer north, winter south—different from the sun’s path of spring east, autumn west, summer south, and winter north. During the four seasonal months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, all belong to earth, which is the true path of the ecliptic. At these times, the stars also belong to the ecliptic. When they return to their proper positions, the sun always follows the ecliptic.\"\n\nZheng’s commentary on the *Hong Fan* asks: \"What does it mean for the four seasons to align with the ecliptic?\" I say: \"Between winter and spring, spring and summer, autumn and winter—these are the four seasonal months belonging to earth. Each season lends its power for eighteen days, totaling seventy-two days, ending between fire and metal. Their position is *kun*, in terms of time. The ecliptic lies at the center, also called the central path. Divided into four—green, red, white, and black—it becomes eight, plus one, making nine months, assisting the sun in generating and completing the myriad things.\"\n\nThus, the *Treatise on Astronomy* says: \"The path the sun follows is called the ecliptic.\" The moon has nine paths: two black paths emerge north of the ecliptic; two red paths emerge south of it; two white paths emerge west of it; and two green paths emerge east of it. Together with the ecliptic, they make nine. At the *Li Chun* and *Chun Fen*, the moon travels east along the green path; at *Li Qiu* and *Qiu Fen*, it travels west along the white path; at *Li Dong* and *Dong Zhi*, it travels north along the black path; at *Li Xia* and *Xia Zhi*, it travels south along the red path. Yellow is the true color. It is also said: \"Green and red emerge from the yang path; white and black emerge from the yin path.\" If the moon deviates from its proper course, traveling the yang path brings drought and wind, while traveling the yin path brings rain and water. Traveling the ecliptic is correct.\n\nThus, the *Xing Bei* says: \"When a wise ruler is on the throne, the sun, moon, and five planets all follow the ecliptic.\" Though the moon’s paths—white, black, red, and green—differ, they never stray beyond the east, west, south, and north of the ecliptic. The sun travels the center of the ecliptic, with its inner part to the north, from *Kui* to *Jiao*, *hai* to *si*. The outer part is to the south, from *Jiao* and *Kang* to *Shi* and *Bi*, *chen* to *xu*. In the east, between *Jiao*, lies the Gate of Heaven; *Fang* is the Celestial Street. The ecliptic passes through it, where the seven luminaries travel.\n\nShaozi said: \"The mutual eclipses of the sun and moon are the intersections of their cycles. When the sun faces the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed—like water and fire overcoming each other. Thus, the noble employ wisdom, while the petty rely on force.\" When the sun and moon face each other, it is called the full moon; when they meet, it is called the new moon.",

Heaven is but a single, purely firm and luminous qi. The earth lies level within it.",

      "translated_text": "The solar eclipse occurs at the new moon, when the moon is near the sun and devoid of light, becoming the dark moon. Thus, when petty men draw close in familiarity, they often endanger their lord. The lunar eclipse occurs at the full moon, when the moon opposes the sun and is at its brightest—like petty men abroad, though powerful, ever in peril. Water overcoming water is direct concealment and conquest, the petty employing force. Fire overcoming water is separation by an intervening object, the noble employing wisdom.\n\nThe sun and moon meet twelve times in a year. When their twelve full-moon nodes intersect, an eclipse occurs; if they do not intersect, there is no eclipse. Thus, while the sun travels the ecliptic, the moon travels the nine paths, and there are times when they intersect yet no eclipse occurs. At the new moon, the sun and moon occupy the same degree. At the full moon, they are at their farthest and in opposition. At the first and last quarters, the sun and moon are near one and far three—such as when the sun is at *wu* and the moon at *mao* or *you*. At the new moon, though the sun and moon are in the same degree east and west, if the moon’s path lies far to the south or north of the sun’s, there is no eclipse. Even if they are close in the south or north, if the sun is on the inner path and the moon on the outer, there is no eclipse.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Eclipses of the sun and moon are not their regular course, yet lunar eclipses are considered ordinary. Solar eclipses are deemed inauspicious because yin overcomes yang and obscures it—an intolerable reversal. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records every solar eclipse but makes no note of lunar eclipses, for this very reason.\" The sun and moon meet twelve times in a year; when they meet, the moon’s light is entirely extinguished, becoming the dark moon. After the meeting, the moon’s light revives, becoming the new moon. Fifteen days before and after the new moon, the sun and moon are in opposition. When the moon’s light is full at the full moon, and the sun and moon are in opposition, occupying the same degree and path, the sun overpowers the moon, and the moon is eclipsed. At the dark and new moons, when the sun and moon conjoin, sharing the same degree east-west and the same path north-south, the moon obscures the sun, and the sun is eclipsed. These follow regular patterns.\n\nYet when the ruler cultivates virtue, employs the worthy, and removes the wicked, yang flourishes and yin cannot encroach, so the moon constantly avoids the sun. Though their paths may be irregular, eclipses that should occur do not. Otherwise, if virtuous governance is neglected, ministers betray their lord, petty men encroach upon the noble, and barbarians disrupt the central kingdom—yin flourishes while yang wanes, and eclipses that should not occur do, marking extraordinary omens.\n\nMaster Guliang records four kinds of solar eclipses: one where the sun is eclipsed at dusk, as in the third year of Duke Yin; one where the eclipse is total at the new moon, as the next day in the seventeenth year of Duke Xiang; one where the eclipse is total, as in the third year of Duke Xiang; and one where the eclipse occurs at night, as in the eighteenth year of Duke Zhuang. A day and night together make one day; if the sun is not eclipsed by day but is by night, the sun is below the earth, and its form is unseen. By the new moon, when the sun first appears, if its light is diminished, it is known that a nighttime eclipse occurred. Nighttime eclipses belong to the dark moon of the previous month. During a nighttime eclipse, the stars lose their light.\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: \"In the meeting of the tenth month.\" Master Zhu adopted Kong’s commentary in great detail, and I now excerpt it here: \"On the new moon of *xinmao*, the sun was eclipsed.\" Ancient calendars and the *Zhou Bi* both state that the celestial sphere measures 365¼ degrees, with the sun and moon both moving rightward across the heavens. The sun travels one degree per day, while the moon travels 13⁷⁄₁₉ degrees per day. Thus, the sun is slow and the moon swift, and after slightly more than twenty-nine days, the moon completes a circuit, overtakes the sun, and meets it—this is called a node. Each month they meet, but the moon may be outside or inside the sun’s path, so eclipses do not always occur; they only happen when they meet. Moreover, the moon and sun must share the same path for an eclipse to occur—this was in the tenth month of the Zhou and the eighth month of the Xia.\n\nWhen the sun and moon meet and a solar eclipse occurs, it is a sign of yin encroaching upon yang, a minister encroaching upon the ruler. That it is called a solar eclipse is because the moon eclipses it. He Xiu said: \"It does not say the moon eclipses it because its form cannot be seen.\" Thus, it is ambiguously called \"the sun was eclipsed.\" From *jia* to *gui* are the days; *jia* is firm and *yi* is yielding, with five firm and five yielding among them, the ten days all being stems, thus the sun is the ruler. From *zi* to *hai* are the ministers; *zi* is yang and *chou* is yin, with six yang and six yin among them, the twelve days all being branches, thus the hours are ministers. *Mao* corresponds to ministers, *xin* to the ruler, metal should overcome wood. Now ministers reverse and encroach upon the ruler—this is the five phases acting in opposition. With *xin* as king in autumn, ministers should rest and withdraw, yet they encroach upon the young ruler who should reign.\n\nThe celestial degrees of ancient and modern times are the same. Solar and lunar eclipses have no fixed time. Calendar makers calculate the nodes of the sun and moon’s meetings, generally setting a limit of slightly more than 173 days. The sun and moon each have their own paths across the heavens. Even when they meet at the new moon, their paths may be outer or inner. If the moon is first on the inner path, eclipses occur more frequently within the limit; if the moon is first on the outer path, eclipses occur less frequently even within the limit. Du Yu, observing these irregularities, said: \"Though the sun and moon are moving bodies with measurable paths, they cannot avoid slight excesses and deficiencies. Thus, even when they meet, there may be no eclipse.\" Only on the day of the summer solstice do the noble take heed.\n\nYet eclipses have no fixed time; they may occur even in months other than the solstices and equinoxes. It is merely that at the two equinoxes, day and night are equal, resembling shared paths, while at the two solstices, length and shortness are at their extremes. If they coincide, it is named to convey meaning, not because it is necessarily so. In truth, all solar eclipses are anomalies. If the ruler reforms his faults and cultivates goodness, even in the month of the summer solstice, disaster can be averted. If he persists in evil and wrongdoing, even in the months of the solstices and equinoxes, misfortune will follow. How can the two solstices and two equinoxes alone be free from calamity?",

      "translated_text": "When the radiant and great luminous Dao/Way shines upon the earth below, should it suddenly dim and vanish, turning day into night, nothing could be more monstrous or strange. Thus, there are established rites of drumming, offering silk, demoting the victorious, and removing music—all to emphasize celestial omens and warn the ruler. Yet the Way of Heaven is profound and distant, and its verifications may come only in time. Or perhaps human misfortune and transgression merely coincide with them. Therefore, the sage seizes upon these changes, often invoking the numinous to serve as admonitions. This allows the wise and discerning to grasp the profound intent of the ancient sages, while those of middling or lesser capacity may believe in omens and portents, thus fostering self-restraint.\n\nYet the numinous may aid teaching but cannot itself be the teaching. To rely solely on the numinous is to delude the masses; to discard it entirely is to harm what is fitting. Thus, its words seem both present and absent, its affairs both credible and doubtful—all to achieve a grand harmony.\n\nDu Yu said: \"The sun’s light, at the time of full moon, obscures the moon’s light, hence a lunar eclipse. When the sun and moon meet, the moon obscures the sun, hence a solar eclipse.\"\n\nSu Shi said: \"Confucius, in compiling the *Spring and Autumn Annals* over 242 years, recorded every celestial anomaly involving the sun and stars, yet never noted lunar eclipses. Commentators explain: the moon represents the way of the feudal lords and the image of the barbarians. When it wanes, it signifies the ruler of the Central Kingdom prevailing. Thus, it is not considered a disaster.\"\n\nThe diviner of Chuqiu in the *Zuozhuan* said: \"The sun has ten divisions, corresponding to ten times and ten ranks. Noon corresponds to the king, the meal hour to the duke, dawn to the minister, cockcrow to the officer, midnight to the commoner, the time of settling to the charioteer, dusk to the servant, sunset to the subordinate, the afternoon to the attendant, and the time of dim light to the menial. The time of the corner sun at sunrise is omitted out of respect for the king and duke.\"\n\nDu Yu of Jin said: \"The time when the sun is at its zenith corresponds to the king; the meal hour to the duke; dawn to the minister; cockcrow to the officer; midnight to the commoner; the time of settling to the charioteer; dusk to the servant; sunset to the subordinate; the afternoon to the attendant; and the time of dim light to the menial. The corner sun at sunrise (mao) and the time of the hidden sun (si) are omitted—both times of sunrise (mao) and emergence (si)—out of reverence for the king and duke.\" This is akin to the five hexagrams of a month, where the first corresponds to the feudal lord, the second to the grandee, the third to the minister, the fourth to the duke, and the fifth to the ruler.\n\nThis fool says: *The Book of Changes* is a work that exalts the yang and suppresses the yin. The sun is the image of the ruler, thus it is revered and exalted. The Upper Canon concludes with thirty hexagrams, ending in *Li* (Fire). *Li* in the heavens is the sun, so all living beings look up to its light. The Lower Canon concludes with thirty-four hexagrams, ending in *Ji Ji* (After Completion), with *Li* present throughout. Without it, the people cannot live, for it sustains their daily needs.\n\n*Qian* (Heaven) is the image of the ruler; *Kun* (Earth) comes to interact with *Qian* to form *Li*. This embodies the principle of ministers serving the ruler with loyalty. Thus, when *Li* ascends to the heavens, it becomes *Dayou* (Great Possession), where the yielding attains a noble position. If reversed, it descends to become *Tongren* (Fellowship with Men). When *Li* emerges above the earth, it becomes *Jin* (Progress), where the sun is received thrice in a day. If reversed, it enters the earth to become *Mingyi* (Darkening of the Light). All this serves to exalt the yang and suppress the yin, ever fearful that the brilliance of the yang might fail to rise in the heavens.\n\nIts other manifestations scatter among the hexagrams, each fulfilling its function: as the cauldron for cooking, as the nobility of human culture, as the abundance of the sun at its zenith, or as the reform of the calendar and the reckoning of time. But in *Kui* (Opposition), *Shi* (Biting Through), *Lü* (The Wanderer), and *Jiaren* (The Family), *Li* is inverted. Its image is named \"Great Yang,\" the primal source of all things. Even the moon and stars borrow its light to adorn the heavens—how much more so for the myriad beings?\n\nKing Wen was imprisoned at Youli and suffered the misfortune of *Mingyi* (Darkening of the Light). Yet he was able to expound the *Changes*, laying the foundation for the Ten Wings transmitted by Confucius. Thus, Confucius’ sun followed King Wen’s, succeeding one another to illuminate the world, establishing the constant order of day and night—was this not the great fortune of all under heaven and later generations?\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Six, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Tian Yuan Fa Wei, Scroll Seven**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai; Collated by Fang Hui Wanli of Xugu*\n\n**The Great Yin (Taiyin)**\n\n*The Shuo Gua* states: \"Kan represents water and the moon; the moon is the essence of water.\"\n\n*The Hetu: Di Lan* says: \"The essence of metal is Kan, with one yang residing within. Internally bright and externally dark, it becomes the moon in heaven and water on earth.\"\n\nHu Shi remarks: \"The moon’s body is Kan, its yang employed by yin. Yang moves swiftly, while yin governs the night.\"\n\n*The Liben Yi* states: \"When the sun appears at dawn, it is called *na* (reception); when it appears at dusk, it is called *tiao* (leaping).\"\n\n*The Wu Xing Zhuan* says: \"When the moon appears in the west at dusk, it is called *tiao*. When it appears in the east at dawn, it is called *ce* (sidelong). Concealment is also named *tiao-na*. When *tiao* occurs, the lords and kings relax; when *ce* or concealment occurs, they hasten.\"\n\n*The Tai Xuan* commentary notes: \"*Tiao* describes the appearance of change. *Tiao* means visibility. The moon appearing in the east at dawn is called *ce*; appearing in the west at dusk is called *tiao*. The sun is male, the moon female—they traverse the heavens without cease.\"\n\n*The Sitian Kao* states: \"When the moon departs in *tiao* or *pu*, it is adjusted according to the calendar. When the sun’s path involves *tiao-na*, it is applied with *han* (shouting).\" It further says: \"The sun’s path and moon’s departure determine the fixed numbers of *tiao-na*, with *tiao-han* and *na-jia* (addition).\"\n\n*The Zhou Pi* says: \"The moon is born where the sun shines; its *po* (lunar essence) arises where the sun is obscured. When aligned with the sun, its light is full; when approaching the sun, its light is exhausted.\"\n\nJing Fang observes: \"Though it has form, it has no light; only when illuminated by the sun does it shine. Where the sun shines, it is bright; where it does not, it remains dark. The moon is *que* (deficient)—when full, it wanes. In the *Xiantian* system, Qian is one and Dui is two; the moon begins from Dui because its motion falls short of the sun’s count.\"\n\nBoth the sun and moon experience waxing and waning. When the sun waxes and the moon wanes, the full moon comes after the midpoint and before the new moon. When the moon waxes and the sun wanes, the full moon comes before the midpoint and after the new moon.\n\nMaster Zhang states: \"The moon is yin essence, the reverse of yang. Where the moon is positioned in yang, it receives the sun’s light but not its essence. At opposition and quadrature, its light is eclipsed—essence cannot be divided.\"\n\nHe further says: \"The essences of the sun and moon mutually reside in each other’s domains.\"\n\nZhu Hanshang remarks: \"*Tai* (Peace) signifies the union of heaven and earth, through which the myriad things communicate. *Pi* (Stagnation) means no union, no communication. *Tai* corresponds to Kan’s nine-five, where water qi ascends. Kan is the body of Kun, and the yang within Kan is two-five. Yang flows into yin, so the moon retreats swiftly. The moon’s body is not bright; it awaits the sun to shine. Brightness is Qian. Qian speaks of the sun and moon’s combined brilliance—Kan and Li mutually employed. *Yu* (Enthusiasm) speaks of the sun and moon not transgressing: Kan is the moon, Li the sun, and they meet in the north. *Heng* (Constancy) speaks of the sun and moon attaining heaven: Qian’s nine-four transforms into Li and Kan.\"\n\nIn *Xiaoxu*’s top nine, *Zhongfu*’s six-four, and *Guimei*’s six-five, the moon nears fullness. In *Xiaoxu*, four conceals Kan, and Xun conceals Zhen. The moon is in the east, the sun in the west—this is fullness. In *Fusong*, Kan transforms into Zhen: the moon in the east is also fullness. In *Guimei*’s six-five, the moon is in the east, the sun in the west—also fullness. In *Xiaoxu* and *Zhongfu*, Kan is in four; in *Guimei*’s six-five, the line is in five. When Kan is in four or five, it is centered. Thus, when the sun opposes the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed—Kan and Li contend for dominance.\n\nSomeone asks: \"Kan is water, Li is fire—how can fire cling to water?\" The answer: \"Li is not bright without water, having no place to attach. Kan is not bright without Li, having no source of generation. When water gathers, essence gathers; when essence gathers, spirit arises. Burning firewood produces charcoal; withered wood becomes ash. Rotten wood glows at night, but when moisture is exhausted, the light dims. Blood becomes *zoulin* (will-o’-the-wisp), seen on dark, rainy nights. Thus it is said: *Li* means *li* (attachment). When Kan’s water is exhausted, Li has nothing to cling to.\"\n\nHengqu states: \"The sun, moon, and five planets move contrary to heaven while encompassing the earth. The moon is yin essence, the reverse of yang, so its rightward motion is swift. The sun’s substance is fundamentally yin; the moon’s substance is fundamentally yang. At the new and full moons, their essences and spirits reverse and exchange, causing eclipses and the laws of waxing and waning. The moon is closer to humans; the sun is distant. Thus, the moon receives the sun’s light always on its outer side. When viewed from earth, its beginning and end appear curved like a hook, and at its zenith, like a half-jade disk—proof of its waxing and waning. Metal and water have inner light, able to repel and receive the essences of yin and yang. Mutually residing in each other’s domains, each attains its proper place. Thus, the forms of the sun and moon remain unchanged through the ages.\"\n\nSomeone asked Master Cheng: \"The moon has a fixed *po*, and the sun is farther than the moon. Does the moon’s reception of the sun’s light cause its waxing and waning as seen by humans?\" He replied: \"The sun and moon are one—how could the sun be higher than the moon? If the moon had no waxing and waning, how would the year be completed? When the moon gains one part of light, its *po* wanes by one part. The moon does not receive the sun’s light, hence the eclipse. When it does not receive the sun’s light, the moon is precisely aligned with yin opposing yang. Drumming assists yang—thus, the green of the sun and moon can both be drummed. The moon does not descend below the sun; when directly opposite, it eclipses the sun. A slight eclipse quickly recovers because it cannot overcome its constant nature. Between the sun and moon, there is a distinction of yin and yang, honor and humility. Near the ruler, its power diminishes; far from the ruler, its influence grows. Thus, when the moon is far from the sun, its light is full; when near, its brightness wanes. Before fullness, it rises in the west; after fullness, it rises in the east.\"\n\nYang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan Jing* states: \"Before fullness, the moon carries its *po* in the west; after fullness, it completes its *po* in the east.\" This means that when the moon is newly born, the sun’s light is cast upon the *po*’s west, filling its east—only at fullness does it become round.",

      "translated_text": "After fullness, the moon’s light fully occupies the east of its *po*, gradually waning in the west until it vanishes at the dark of the moon. The moon borrows the sun’s light to shine; before fullness, the sun lies to its right, and after fullness, the sun lies to its left—thus each receives light according to its position.\n\nMaster Zhu remarked that Yang Xiong’s two lines were mistakenly phrased. The *Book of Documents* states: “In the first month, on *renchen*, the *po* dies at its side.” It also says: “In the fourth month, the light begins to be born.” The *Record of Rites* states: “Three and five to fullness, three and five to waning.” Cai Jiufeng said: “The first month establishes *yin*; this is the first month of the year. It is not called the ‘proper’ month but the ‘first’ because the Shang dynasty established *chou*. Here, ‘the first month’ refers to the first month. The second day is the death of the *po*—the new moon. The *po* dying at its side is the second day. The first light of the moon appears on the third day.” The *Treatise on the Calendar* states: “When the moon is nearly new but not yet visible, the day is called the death of the *po*. When it forms light in the evening, it is called *chu*.” Master Chen said: “Some take the ‘beginning of light’ as the third day of the moon. Tang scholar Kong believed that both the birth of light and the death of the *po* occur at the start of the month—how could this be the same as the new moon? The moon’s light begins faintly; as light is born, the *po* dies. Thus, it is the first death of the *po*, for when the *po* dies, light is born. The first day of the moon is the birth of light; the second day is the *po* dying at its side. By the full moon, light is fully born and the *po* fully dead. From the day after fullness, the moon’s *po* begins to be born. As the *po* is born, light dies. By the dark of the moon, light is fully dead and the *po* fully born. Thus, the end of the month is called *hui* (darkness), for the *po* is entirely dark. The beginning of the month is called *shuo* (new moon), for its light is first seen. Observing the dark and new moons, Zheng Xuan’s interpretation should be considered correct. Various scholars take ‘the beginning of the *po*’ as the sixteenth day. Yet the *po* begins to be born the day after fullness, and fullness may fall on the fifteenth, sixteenth, or fourteenth day—it cannot be fixed. The sixteenth day is not necessarily the birth of the *po*.”\n\nMaster Kaoting said: “The length of the month is calculated as twenty-nine and twenty-nine four-hundred-ninetieths days. Observe when the new moon occurs. When the month is long, the third day sees the first light; when short, the second day. From the first light to the first quarter is fifteen days, and the full moon’s light is complete—this is the birth",

      "translated_text": "Master Kaoting further stated: “From the last quarter to the dark moon, the moon and sun become indistinct. The moon lies behind the sun, its light entirely concealed, its body hidden. When the *po* overlays the sun, a solar eclipse occurs; when it lies behind the sun, there is no eclipse. At the dark and new moons, the sun and moon are conjoined.”\n\nThe *Chu Ci* asks: “What virtue does the night’s light possess, that in death it revives? What benefit does it seek, that the hare ever dwells within its belly?” This questions what virtue the moon holds to die and be reborn, and what advantage it gains by gazing back, that the hare constantly resides within it.\n\nThe answer states: “According to the old theories of calendar scholars, at the new moon the moon gradually moves away from the sun, so the *po* dies and brightness is born. After the full moon, it gradually approaches the sun, so the *po* is born and brightness dies. By the dark moon and new moon, it moves away from the sun again, and brightness is reborn. This is what is meant by ‘dying and reviving.’” This explanation is mistaken. If it were true, then before the full moon, the west would be near and the east far, and the newly born brightness should appear on the moon’s eastern side. After the full moon, the east would be near and the west far, and the not-yet-dead brightness should appear on the moon’s western side. How could it be that before the full moon the *po* is borne on the west, and after the full moon the *po* ends on the east, while brightness is distant from the sun? Thus, Shen Kuo’s explanation is the correct one.\n\nHe said: “The moon itself has no light; it is like a silver pellet, which shines only when illuminated by the sun. When the light first appears, the sun lies beside it, so the light is slanted, and what is seen is but a hook. As it moves farther away, the light shines obliquely and gradually fills out. Generally, it is like a pellet of nine measures, with powder applied to half: viewed from the side, the powdered part appears like a hook; viewed directly, it is perfectly round.”\n\nWang Pu of later times further developed this theory, saying: “On the evening when the moon’s brightness is born, only a hook is seen. When the sun and moon are in opposition, a person standing between them sees its fullness. Yet at the quarters and dark moon, it is no different from the full moon—people simply do not see it. From this, we know the moon’s light is always full; its waxing and waning arise from the observer’s position and perspective, not from death and revival.”\n\nThe moon is a yin essence, its form round and substance clear. When illuminated by the sun’s light, its brightness is seen; when not illuminated, it is but *po*. At the full moon, when the sun and moon are in opposition and a person stands between them, the moon’s brightness is fully visible, and its form is round. At the first and last quarters, the sun illuminates its side, and a person observes it from the side, so half is bright and half is *po*. On the day of the dark moon, the sun shines upon its outer surface, while a person stands within, so it is not seen.\n\nHe further said: “Within the moon’s brightness lies a dark void, its darkness exceedingly subtle. At the full moon, the moon and sun are directly opposite, without the slightest deviation. The moon is struck by the dark void, hence the eclipse. Though this is yin overcoming yang, it is ultimately inauspicious. If yin had the intention to retreat, it would not reach this point; it is their direct opposition that causes the eclipse.”\n\nZhang Heng of the Han said: “Fire emits light outward, while water contains reflections. The moon’s light arises from where the sun shines, and its *po* arises from where the sun is obscured. When facing the sun, its light is full; when approaching the sun, its light is exhausted. The stars are illuminated by its light, which is turned by water. When opposite the sun, its light is never fully united because it is obscured by the earth—this is called the dark void. When the stars or a faint moon encounter it, they cause the sun’s old eclipse. Its brightness: looking from darkness to light, the light is unobstructed, so it appears like fire. When at mid-heaven, heaven and earth share its brightness. Looking from brightness to union, union still has its奪 (seizure), so it appears like water. Fire blazes at night but is not bright in daylight.”\n\nI say: “The theory of the dark void originates here. The so-called dark void is yin embracing yang to form the moon. *Kan* is the moon, and the single yang line within *Kan* is originally the single yin line within *Li*. *Qian* enters *Kun* to become the moon, and *Kun* enters *Qian* to become the sun. At the full moon, the sun and moon are in opposition, and the pure essences meet, so *Li* faces the sun with the body of *Qian*, seeking to absorb the single yang line within the moon—hence the moon is eclipsed. What is called the dark void is precisely the single yin line within *Li*. This is an evident matter, yet no one in ancient times ever spoke of it.”\n\nHe further said: “When the moon is near the sun, its light appears as a single crescent. As it moves farther away, its light gradually increases. For example, when the sun is at noon and the moon is at *you*, it is near one and far three, forming a quarter. At the full moon, the sun is in the west and the moon in the east; a person below gazes up and sees its light in full.”\n\nThe *Hun Yi Lüe Shuo* states: “The moon moves swiftly while the sun moves leisurely; it takes slightly more than twenty-nine days for them to meet. Thus, in one year they conjoin twelve times. Their conjunction forms the dark moon, and from the dark moon, revival begins—brightness is born anew. This is called the swift movement of the new moon, gradually distancing itself from the sun. In terms of the celestial sphere, its nearness to the sun is slightly more than ninety-one degrees, and its distance from the sun is slightly more than 374 degrees. This is what is meant by ‘near one, far three’ forming the quarter—this is the first quarter. As it moves farther and opposes the sun, the distance is slightly more than 182 degrees and 62 minutes—this is called mutual opposition. Dividing the center of heaven forms the full moon, for the sun and moon are in opposition. After passing the center, it is distant from the sun by slightly more than 274 degrees. This is what is meant by ‘near one, far three’ forming the quarter—this is the last quarter. The first quarter typically occurs on the eighth day, the last quarter on the twenty-second day, and the full moon on the fifteenth day—this is the norm. The first quarter may occasionally retreat to the seventh day or advance to the ninth; the last quarter may retreat to the twenty-first day or advance to the twenty-third. The full moon may retreat to the fourteenth day or advance to the sixteenth—these are its variations.”",
      "overlap_context": "ness may fall on the fifteenth, sixteenth, or fourteenth day—it cannot be fixed. The sixteenth day is not necessarily the birth of the *po*.”\n\nMaster Kaoting said: “The length of the month is calculated as twenty-nine and twenty-nine four-hundred-ninetieths days. Observe when the new moon occurs. When the month is long, the third day sees the first light; when short, the second day. From the first light to the first quarter is fifteen days, and the full moon’s light is complete—this is the birth",

      "translated_text": "The first quarter is when the moon waxes to half, resembling the upper string of a bow. The last quarter is when the moon wanes by half, resembling the lower string of a bow.\n\nIt is also said: The *Xiantian Diagram* depicts the phases of a month, progressing from *Fu* to *Zhen*. On the third day, the moon begins to brighten. By *Dui*, on the eighth day, the moon reaches its first quarter. On the fifteenth day, at *Qian*, it is the full moon. At *Xun*, the moon begins to wane, on the eighteenth day. At *Gen*, it is the last quarter, on the twenty-third day. At *Kun*, the moon becomes new, on the thirtieth day. In a single breath, there are the new moon, crescent, quarter, and full moon.\n\nThe first quarter is when qi begins to grow, descending from above. The last quarter is when qi begins to wane, ascending from below. The full moon is when qi reaches its fullness below, and the moon becomes round above. Between the new moon and the crescent, the sun and moon conjoin above—this is like \"using water to extinguish fire\" or \"metal returning to its original nature.\"\n\nThe terms *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* refer to the sun’s rising and setting at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six trigrams’ directions.\n\nIt is further said: The phases—waxing brightness, waning darkness, quarters, full moon, new moon, and crescent—are all named according to their orientation toward or away from the sun. From the waxing brightness to the first quarter, as the sun sets in the west, the moon follows and begins to grow. The dark part generates brightness, facing downward to meet the sun, and light arises from below. By the time it reaches the midpoint, how could it not form the upper string, appearing before the full moon?\n\nAfter the full moon until the last quarter, as the sun rises in the east, the moon follows and begins to wane. The bright part generates darkness, facing upward to distance itself from the sun. The light from before the full moon entirely transforms into darkness. Brightness retreats and dies from below, and when it reaches the quarter again, it becomes like metal and water. As before, it reaches the midpoint, how could it not form the lower string, appearing after the full moon?\n\nIt is also said: *Zhen* is one, *Dui* one, *Qian* three, *Xun* four, *Gen* five, and *Kun* six—each five days form a node. The beginning of the crescent marks the start of the moon’s activity, the initial interaction of the sun and moon’s yin and yang. After the twenty-sixth day, until the second day, it is *Kun*. When the sun moves to *Zhen*, the moon gains one part of light. At *Dui*, the moon gains two parts of light. At *Qian*, the moon’s entire body is illuminated.\n\nAfter the sixteenth day until *Xun*, the moon’s light gradually wanes. By the time of the new moon and crescent, the sun and moon converge, and no light is visible. The sun and moon meet and separate at the new moon. The moon is obscured, revealing its dark side, so its yin body is fully visible—this is the new moon. Representing *Kun*, at this time the moon is in the *yi* direction, and the sun is in *yi*; since they conjoin, *Kun* corresponds to *yi*. When the moon reaches the new moon, it moves from east to north to meet the sun. East is *yi*; north is *gui*. *Yi* diminishes into *gui*, converging at *Qian* and *Ren*. *Ren* and *gui* are where the qi of the north gathers. After twelve meetings, all things flourish, and the moon reappears at *Zhen* and *Dui*.\n\nOnly after heaven and earth interact does *Zhen* arise. *Zhen* is the beginning of heaven and earth’s interaction and the flourishing of all things. When *Kun* ends at *yi* and *gui*, *Qian* begins at *Zhen* and *geng*. The full moon, new moon, and crescent follow one another endlessly.\n\nIn the first node, on the third day, it is pure yin. When the first yang begins to interact in the center, a single line of light appears, and the moon takes the form of *Zhen*. At this time, the moon is faintly visible in the west at the *geng* position, while the sun is just setting below the earth, so *Zhen* corresponds to *geng*. After six days, in the second node, two yangs generate brightness, half illuminating the dark part—this is the first quarter. The moon takes the form of *Dui*, faintly visible in the south at the *xin* position.\n\nAfter another six days, in the middle of the third node, on the fifteenth day, it is full and pure yang, and the moon takes the form of *Qian*. It is faintly visible in the east at the *jia* position, receiving light as the sun aligns with the earth’s surface. After the full moon, at the beginning of the fourth node on the sixteenth day, the *Qian* body begins to receive the first yin, becoming *Xun* and generating darkness. The moon takes the form of *Xun*, setting in the west at the *xin* position as the sun aligns with it.\n\nAfter another six days, in the middle of the fifth node, on the twenty-second day, one yang is restored. The first yin in the center forms *Gen*, and the moon takes the form of *Gen*, setting at dawn in the south at the *bing* position. On the thirtieth day, the sixth node ends, all three yangs transform, and the light is entirely extinguished as the moon’s body hides in the northwest. After the six nodes of a month are complete, they pass to the next month, and the *Zhen* trigram reappears.\n\nChapter Fourteen of the *Cantong Qi* states:\n*Gen* aligns with the south at *bing*, the last quarter on the twenty-third day.\n*Kun* at *yi* on the thirtieth day, in the northeast its light is lost.\nWhen the nodes are exhausted, they pass and the body continues, the dragon is reborn thus.\n\nRegarding the *Na Jia* system: The father *Qian* corresponds to *jia-zi* and *ren-wu*. *Zhen*, the eldest son, inherits the father’s body and corresponds to *geng-zi* and *geng-wu*—*zi* and *wu* are the same as *Qian*. The mother *Kun* corresponds to *yi-wei* and *gui-chou*. *Xun*, the eldest daughter, inherits the mother’s body and corresponds to *xin-chou* and *xin-wei*—*chou* and *wei* are the same as *Kun*. *Kan*, the middle son, corresponds to *wu-yin* and *wu-shen*. *Gen*, the youngest son, corresponds to *bing-xu* and *bing-chen*. *Li*, the middle daughter, corresponds to *ji-mao* and *ji-you*. *Dui*, the youngest daughter, corresponds to *ding-si* and *ding-hai*.\n\n*Ren*, *gui*, *geng*, *xin*, *wu*, *ji*, *bing*, *ding*, *jia*, and *yi* proceed from below to above. *Qian* and *Kun* each use two, encompassing the six children within, enabling generation and transformation. *Wu* and *ji* are the central earth. *Kan* yang corresponds to *wu*, and *Li* yin corresponds to *ji*—yin and yang each reside in their proper place at the center. *Ren* is the essence of yang, *jia* the head of yang, *gui* the blood of yin, and *yi* the beginning of yin. The two elders envelop and conceal, with *Kan* and *Li* acting at the center—this is the divine work of heaven and earth’s creation.\n\nThree hundred eighty-four lines form the number of a complete celestial cycle. Each line governs one day, and four trigrams govern twenty-four lines to correspond to the twenty-four qi.",

      "translated_text": "A single month encompasses the crescent, full, waning, and new moons; a single day encompasses *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. Speaking of one day, then one month and one year are all contained within it. From *zi* to *si*, light is born, and within this lies the first quarter leading to the full moon. From *wu* to *hai*, the lunar essence is born, and within this lies the last quarter returning to darkness. The twelve hours correspond to the twelve sovereign hexagrams, and the seventy-two lines correspond to the seventy-two seasonal nodes.\n\nSpeaking of one month, the two crescents above and below correspond to the two eights of yin and yang, and the three hundred sixty hours correspond to the three hundred sixty lines—further mirroring the three hundred sixty days. Speaking of one year, the six lines of the *na jia* system divide into the twelve sovereign hexagrams, doubled. The work of the year is thus completed, the labor of a full year condensed within a single month. Observing the year through the month, the month through the day, the day through the hours, and the hours through the *ke*—even within a single *ke* of effort, the qi and seasonal signs of an entire year are present. The subtlety of creation’s workings may be minutely examined thus.\n\nMaster Shao said: The moon embraces yang as yin—it is yang within yin. As yang wanes, yin arises, so the sun descends while the moon rises in the west. When yin flourishes, it contends with yang, so at the full moon, the moon rises in the east. Heaven is the father, the sun the child—thus heaven revolves leftward. The sun is the husband, the moon the wife—thus the sun rises in the east while the moon is born in the west. When the moon is distant from the sun, its light is born and its motion slows; when near, its essence is born and its motion quickens—this is the principle of ruler and minister.\n\nThough the sun moves rightward, it follows heaven’s leftward turn. Though the moon moves swiftly, it meets the sun only after the sun has passed, ever trailing behind. That stars follow the moon is seen at night. According to various calendrical theories: from the first to the fourth day, the moon moves fastest, traversing over fourteen degrees in a day and night. From the twenty-fourth day to the new moon, it is again swift, moving at the same rate. From the fifth to the eighth day, its motion is next fastest, traversing over thirteen degrees daily. From the twentieth to the twenty-third day, it moves slightly faster, at the same rate. From the ninth to the nineteenth day, its motion slows, traversing over twelve degrees daily. Averaged over a month, it moves thirteen and seven-nineteenths degrees per day. Distant from the sun, its light is born and its motion slows; near, its essence is born and its motion quickens—here too lies the principle of ruler and minister.\n\nThe moon has no light of its own but borrows from the sun. When it waxes full, it contends with yang—how cautious must a ruler be! Heaven revolves leftward, the sun moves rightward. The sun rises in the east, the moon is born in the west—this is the principle of father and son, husband and wife. That the full moon also rises in the east is to contend with yang, an irregular path.\n\nI offer this explanation: Heaven is greatest, the sun next, the moon next still. Thus the sun’s motion does not match heaven’s, nor the moon’s the sun’s. One exalted, one humble—each has its measure, and this is heaven’s teaching. King Wen expounded the *Yi* at *Kan*, speaking of practice through images, saying the moon has one yang at its center, encircled by two yins. In a year’s twelve solar terms, the moon always follows the sun and dares not precede yang—its meaning is profound. Yin assists yang to complete the year’s work, and the moon’s aid is indispensable. Yet when yin overreaches yang to encroach upon the noble, vigilance is all the more essential.\n\nThus in *Qian*, the text speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"their light conjoined.\" In *Jia*, it speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"not transgressing.\" In *Da*, it speaks of sun and moon, then adds \"attaining heaven.\" Though sun and moon are mentioned together, the moon is never placed before the sun—all to convey the intent of exalting yang and restraining yin. Where the moon alone is taken as a warning, the meaning is especially urgent. In *Xiaoxu*, the moon nears fullness and danger arises, for it harbors hidden *Kan* and *Xun* contains hidden *Zhen*. The moon is in the east, the sun in the west. *Xiaoxu*’s single yin overreaches the yang of the ninth line—hence the omen is dire. In *Guimei*, the sixth line, the moon also nears fullness yet brings fortune, for *Kan* moon is in the east, *Li* sun in the west. Yin and yang reside at the center, and though sun and moon face each other, nearing fullness they do not contend—hence the omen is auspicious.\n\nThus the moon may govern night but not day—such is the Way of Heaven, how much more so for man! When the moon opposes the sun, a lunar eclipse occurs; when the moon obscures the sun, a solar eclipse occurs. Yin must not contend with yang, ministers must not overreach rulers, wives must not overreach husbands, the petty must not overreach the noble. Master Cheng said: A minister occupying the ruler’s position—Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo are examples—is still speakable. A woman occupying the ruler’s position—Nüwa and Empress Wu are examples—is an extraordinary aberration, unspeakable.\n\nThe *Han Annals* states: The moon revolves rightward, aligning with the *Xiantian* diagram’s eight trigrams. The *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars* says: The sun has dark and new moons, the moon has crescents and fullness. The sun is yang, the moon yin—yin qi is ever present, while yang is consumed and refined. After the new moon, the moon moves rightward, gradually departing the sun and light is born. Around the seventh or eighth day, it reaches the first quarter, half-illuminated. By the fifteenth day, the moon is farthest from the sun, fully bright. After the full moon, it gradually nears the sun’s left side, and brightness wanes. Around the twenty-second or twenty-third day, the moon is half-bright again—this is the last quarter. On the thirtieth day, sun and moon conjoin, the moon’s light consumed by the sun—this is the dark moon.\n\nAmong various theories, only this is credible. I have compared the hexagrams with the twelve earthly branches: on the dark moon, the hexagram is *Kun*, sun and moon meet at *zi*, and the moon’s light is extinguished. Between the dark and new moons, it revolves rightward from *Kun*, and the hexagram becomes *Gen*—yang is born, light appearing externally. Between *xu* and *hai*, it turns due west to the *Kan* hexagram—one yang resides at the center, far from the sun at mid-heaven—this is the first quarter. At midnight, it is at *you*; the sun rises in the east, illuminating the western half of the moon—hence it is said: \"Within it is the cock.\"",
      "overlap_context": "s to *ji*—yin and yang each reside in their proper place at the center. *Ren* is the essence of yang, *jia* the head of yang, *gui* the blood of yin, and *yi* the beginning of yin.

Each line governs one day, and four trigrams govern twenty-four lines to correspond to the twenty-four qi.",

At midnight, it resides between *wei* and *shen*, midway between the first quarter and full moon. As the sun’s illumination grows more direct, the moon turns to *Qian* at noon, while the sun stands directly above or below *Kun* at *zi*, their opposition creating full illumination—hence its name: the full moon.\n\nThen, turning left from *Li* at *wu* toward the interval between *chen* and *si*, what once faced *xu* and *hai* to generate brightness now generates the lunar essence. As the sun’s light shines obliquely, one yin arises externally, forming the *Dui* hexagram. *Dui* turns to *Li*, and the moon stands due east, half the sky distant from the sun; the lunar essence returns to the center—this is the last quarter. At midnight, it is at *mao*; the moon rises in the west, illuminating the eastern half—hence it is said: \"Within it is the hare.\"\n\nProceeding to *Zhen*, it again stands opposite *Xun*. In *Xun*, one yin gradually wanes and the moon waxes full; in *Zhen*, two yin lines grow strong and the moon wanes. The sun draws nearer, brightness remaining only within; at midnight, it resides between *chou* and *yin*, midway between the last quarter and dark moon, until at *Kun* the moon is extinguished.\n\nThe sequence of hexagrams begins in the north and proceeds west because the moon’s motion retreats in degree and turns rightward. The sequence of lines proceeds from external to internal because the moon receives the sun’s light from without to within. This explanation accords well with the *Han Annals* and the *Xiantian* hexagrams.\n\nSome say: the sun is measured at *wu*, the moon at *zi*, and the stellar lodges at dusk and dawn. The author of the *Cantong Qi* failed to grasp the moon’s retrograde motion and the principle of receiving light from without, thus seizing upon *Kan* and *Li* as central while taking *Zhen* as the birth of brightness and *Dui* as the first quarter—this is entirely backward. Though he overturned the explanations of earlier scholars and deemed it a revelation of the moon’s ancient secrets, I consider this but one interpretation within the *Book of Changes*. Yet Master Zhu’s investigations in the *Cantong Qi Kaozhu* were most precise.

      "translated_text": "The Lesser Yang’s stellar phenomena are manifold and defy exhaustive exposition. Stars are the essence of primordial *qi*. Master Shao said: “The Lesser Yang gives rise to stars.” Zhang Lingxian stated: “The celestial offices within and beyond the central palace number one hundred twenty-four in constant brightness, with three hundred twenty named. The stars themselves total two thousand five hundred, while the faint stars number eleven thousand five hundred twenty.” Master Luo often remarked to me that astrologers, like the *aili* people, leave one utterly bewildered. To grasp the myriad forms of the cosmos, one need not look beyond the finger-signs of the Five Phases. From the Supreme Ultimate’s division into Yin and Yang, Yin and Yang unfold into the Five Phases. The Five Stars are the essence of the Five Phases. The sun, moon, and Five Stars constitute the Seven Governors. Scattered across the four directions, each direction has its seven lodges. Including the Northern Dipper at the center, there are five times seven—thirty-five names—all inseparable from the Five Phases. Thus, Ban Gu said: “The Supreme Ultimate moves the Three Luminaries and Five Stars above at the *shangyuan*; *qi* revolves the Three Sequences and Five Phases below among men. The imperial throne embodies the Three Powers and Five Affairs at the center, dividing into the Three Talents—what lies beyond the Five Phases?” Master Ouyang said: “Yao commanded Xi and He to observe the central stars and rectify the four seasons, keeping the Dao simple. Descending to later ages, the methods grew increasingly refined, accumulating the wisdom of many before attaining their utmost subtlety. During the Three Dynasties, lost texts lay scattered, and the Six Classics offered no confusion—yet the affairs of Heaven and man are hard to speak of. What remains today takes the Five Phases as its foundation, not daring to compare with the starry chronicles of history.”\n\nMaster Shao said: “The theory of the Five Stars began with Gan Gong and Shi Gong.” The Five Stars’ theory was unheard of in antiquity. The *Book of Yu* merely states: “They pacified the Five Luminaries.” By the time of Gan and Shi, it was fully revealed. Shi Shen was a man of Wei who composed the *Star Canon*. Gan De was his contemporary. Stars have three colors to distinguish the three schools’ differences: those from Shi appear red, those from Gan appear black, and those from Wu Xian appear yellow. The purple palace and all stars within and beyond it also derive from the three schools, totaling three hundred eighty-three names and seven hundred eighty-three stars. What is applied in the sphere-school are only the celestial pole, Northern Dipper, and twenty-eight lodges, essential for divination. The rest are recorded merely to complete the celestial body’s full image.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “The Five Wefts are the essence of the Five Stars.” Ban Gu said: “The Five Stars move eastward while the heavens turn west. The constant stars serve as the warp, the Five Stars as the weft. Interweaving warp and weft, they form celestial patterns.” The refined *qi* of the Five Phases, when forming shapes on earth, coalesce into wood, fire, soil, metal, and water. When forming images in the heavens, wood aligns with Jupiter in the east, fire with Mars in the south, metal with Venus in the west, water with Mercury in the north, and soil with Saturn at the center. In man, wood’s spirit is benevolence, associated with appearance; fire’s spirit is propriety, associated with vision; metal’s spirit is righteousness, associated with speech; water’s spirit is wisdom, associated with hearing; and soil’s spirit is trust, associated with thought and the heart. Distributed across the four seasons, wood flourishes in spring, fire in summer, metal in autumn, and water in winter, each dominating for seventy-two days. Soil flourishes in the four seasons—during the months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—for eighteen days each, totaling three hundred sixty. Their colors are: wood green, fire red, metal white, water black, and soil yellow. Their terrestrial correspondences each have their place, further varying in dominance, mutual generation, rest, and decline. Their colors differ: when dominant, they shine with radiance; when mutually generating, they are inwardly full; when at rest, their radiance lacks edges and does not sway; when in decline, their light diminishes in color. A white halo portends mourning; a red halo, war; a green halo, summer floods; a black halo, plagues and many deaths; a yellow halo, good fortune. White horns herald sounds of weeping; red horns, assaults on our cities; black horns, floods and exhausted armies.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: “When the Five Stars share the same color, the world lays down its arms, the people live in peace, the five grains flourish, spring winds and autumn rains come in season, winter is cold and summer hot, the sun does not eclipse at the new moon, nor the moon at the full. This is a state with the Dao, and a sage must occupy its throne.”\n\n**Jupiter**—Wood’s nature is gentle and upright. Historians say it oversees the faults of the world’s rulers. It governs the year’s five grains, dividing the four seven lodges into twelve stations. It traverses one station per year, with the Great Year in *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. At the four cardinal points, it moves through three lodges per year, with the Great Year in *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*. At the four initial and final points—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—it moves through two lodges per year. Two times eight is sixteen, three times four is twelve, totaling twenty-eight lodges. Jupiter completes one celestial circuit in twelve years, forming one cycle. The Great Year is Yin, moving left in *yin*. Jupiter is Yang, turning right in *chou*. When the Great Year is in *mao*, Jupiter resides in *zi*; when in *chen*, Jupiter resides in *hai*, and so forth. Thus, when the Great Year is in *yin*, Jupiter first appears in the east in the first month; when in *mao*, it appears in the east at dawn in the second month. From this, the rest can be deduced. The land where Jupiter resides enjoys good fortune. If it deviates from its station, the opposite land suffers misfortune. Greater calamity follows greater deviation, lesser calamity follows lesser deviation, and no fault arises if it does not deviate.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Wood embodies the waxing and waning of a year. The *chen* station is where it transitions each month, bearing the image of a year.”\n\n**Mars**—Fire’s nature is fierce and violent, thus it governs the execution of laws. It regularly enters the Supreme Subtlety in the tenth month, receives restraint, and departs. The stellar lodges oversee the lawless; its movements are irregular, completing one celestial circuit every two years.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Fire is Yin in substance yet Yang in its gathering. Its *qi* is akin to the sun’s, hence its slowness is twice that of the sun.”",

      "translated_text": "The Fire Star moves from presence to absence, from absence to presence, governed by the transformative *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Saturn**—Earth’s nature is weighty and profound, residing in *wu-si* during late summer. Among the four seasons, it is like the heart in a person, governing the four limbs and all organs. Thus, when the four stars err, Saturn is the first to move. One account says: it governs the feminine image. Another says: it is the Star of the Son of Heaven. When the Son of Heaven loses trust, Saturn stirs greatly. It regularly advances one stellar lodge in the year of *jia-chen* at the origin of the Dipper, completing one celestial circuit every twenty-eight years. Where it lingers long, that land’s virtue is deep.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Saturn’s motion is the slowest, yet it is not entirely bound to Earth.”\n\n**Venus**—Metal’s nature is firm and unyielding, governing military affairs as a Yin star. When it emerges in the east, it should conceal itself in the east; when it emerges in the west, it should conceal itself in the west.\n\nBan said: “It regularly emerges in the east with Mars on *jia-yin* of the first month, remaining visible for two hundred forty days before withdrawing for forty days. It then reappears in the east, emerging at *yin* and *xu*, and withdrawing at *chou* and *wei*. Generally, it completes one celestial circuit each year, nearly matching the sun and moon.”\n\n**Mercury**—Water’s nature is placid and mild, governing the gains and losses of form and law, and rectifying the four seasons. It regularly appears at *Kui* and *Lou* at the spring equinox, at *Dongjing* at the summer solstice, at *Jiao* and *Kang* at the autumn equinox, and at *Qianniu* at the winter solstice. It emerges at *chen* and *xu*, and withdraws at *chou* and *wei*. It is observed in the east at dawn and in the west at dusk. If it fails to appear for one season, that season is disharmonious. If it fails to appear for all four seasons, the realm suffers great famine. It also completes one celestial circuit each year.\n\nSome say: Mercury is the Hour Star, with eleven hours in a season and twelve meetings in a month. Scattered between Heaven and Earth, it acts everywhere without exception. When its moisture and nourishment appear untimely, cold and heat lose their rhythm, thus it embodies the image of the Great One. For the Water and Fire Stars depend on each other: Fire may be present or absent, Water may be full or parched, both receiving the transformative *qi* of Heaven and Earth.\n\nMaster Zhang said: “Metal and Water cling to the sun, advancing and retreating before and after it. The principle is profound, residing in things, and its resonance may be known.”\n\nThe *Star Classic* says: “Venus and Mercury follow the sun in their course. When swift, they precede the sun; when slow, they trail it. When swift and preceding the sun, they appear at dusk in the west. When slow and trailing the sun, they appear at dawn in the east.”\n\nThe *Odes* commentary states: “Before the sun rises, it opens the way for the sun’s brightness, hence the Bright Star is called *Qiming* (Starter of Dawn). After the sun sets, it continues the sun’s light, hence the Bright Star is called *Chang Geng* (Long Twilight).”\n\nThe *Han Odes Outer Commentary* further says: “When Venus appears at dawn in the east, it is *Qiming*; when it appears at dusk in the west, it is *Chang Geng*.” It may be that Metal and Water, these two stars, can be spoken of interchangeably.\n\nSun Yan said: “The Bright Star is Venus. When it emerges in the east at dawn, three lodges high, it is called the Bright Star of today. When it emerges in the west at dusk, three lodges high, it is called Venus. Thus *Qiming* is Venus, but what star is *Chang Geng*? It may be that one star appears in both east and west under different names, or that the two are distinct stars—this cannot be determined with certainty.”\n\nMaster Zhu resolved it, saying: “*Chang Geng* is Mercury; *Qiming* is Venus. When Metal is west of the sun, as the sun is about to rise, it appears in the east. When Water is east of the sun, as the sun is about to set, it appears in the west. This saying exhausts the matter.”\n\nZhang Pingzi said: “When *Sheti* and Mars appear at dawn, they cling to the sun; when Venus and Mercury appear at dusk, they cling to the moon. This requires separate investigation.”\n\nMaster Cheng said: “The true primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth converges within the celestial reckoning, so that the sun and moon form a *bi* (jade disk), and the five stars string like pearls—thus giving birth to the Sage. According to the calendar, at the origin of the primordial chaos of high antiquity, the year was named *Yanfeng Jia Shetige Yin*. At the *jiazi* new moon, midnight of the winter solstice, the sun, moon, and five stars all converged at *Zi*, hence the auspicious signs of *bi* and *lian zhu* (connected pearls) appeared, corresponding to the epoch when Emperor Zhuan established the calendar.\n\nAgain, in the first year of the Han dynasty, the ten-month month, the five stars gathered at *Dongjing*, serving as the omen of Emperor Gao’s receipt of the Mandate. Again, in the fifth year of the Qiande reign of the Song, the third month, the five stars aligned like strung pearls, scattered across *Jiang Lou*, signifying the brilliance of culture throughout the realm.\n\nAs Master Cheng said: ‘The true primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth cannot be mingled with wandering *qi*, hence it converges to give birth to the Sage.’ Such was the case with Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Zhou, and Confucius. Here I cite three examples to verify the signs of creation; others need not be exhaustively listed.\n\nI once considered that Emperor Wu changed the reign title to *Taichu* out of admiration for Emperor Zhuan, altering the era to align with that auspicious sign—though in truth, no such celestial configuration occurred in Emperor Wu’s time.\n\nSu Shi of the Dongpo said: “Metal and Water always remain near the sun, no more than ten degrees away. When the sun is at *Ji* and *Wei*, this casts doubt on the claim.” In my view, the Qin took the tenth month as the first. The tenth month corresponds to the present eighth month, and at the seventh-month node, the sun still lingers between *Jiao* and *Yi*. Thus, the gathering of Metal and Water at *Jing* is not so distant. Dongpo’s argument is ultimately based on Han annotations.\n\nThe gathering of the five stars at *Kui* occurred in the domain of Lu, marking the beginning of great peace throughout the realm, as noted by Dou Yi.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The *wei* stars are Yang within Yin; the *jing* stars are Yin within Yang. The five stars are the *qi* of Earth’s Wood, Water, Fire, Soil, and Metal, ascending and coalescing, yet they receive the sun’s light. The *jing* stars are the surplus of Yang *qi*, congealed and flickering, their light unstable. The *wei* stars have rays and points, their inherent light also unmoving, and all receive the sun’s light.”\n\nMaster Zhu also said: “The *jing* stars revolve leftward day and night, completing slightly more than one circuit. Heaven has twelve stations, and now the Weaving Girl star beside the Milky Way ‘seven times daily’—from *mao* to *you*—passes through seven stations.”",

      "translated_text": "The *Erya* annotation states: The Five Stars all move rightward through the twenty-eight lunar lodges, while the celestial body remains fixed, hence they are called *jing* stars. The Five Stars serve as *wei*, like the warp and weft of woven fabric. However, among the Five *wei*, only the Chen star is difficult to observe, just as the flow of blood through the interstices of flesh and muscle is most subtle. The Chen star belongs to Kan, the Water trigram, which excels in concealment. The Yuan, Ji, Tuo, and Qian rivers flow hidden for over a thousand *li* before emerging. The Celestial Palace and the Emperor’s Mansion are all central *jing* stars. The *wei* stars, being mobile, are Yang, yet Venus and the Chen star are Yin. The *jing* stars, being immobile, are Yin, yet the *Ximu* and *Chunshou* regions are Yang.\n\nShaozi said: The stars that are Yang within Yin are the most minute, like dust and sand, and when they fall, they form mounds. He also said: When stars fall to earth, they become stone. The surplus of stellar Yang, the Five Stars correspond to the human Five Viscera, while the various stars correspond to the human limbs and bones. When essence, blood, and spirit are preserved, essence abides, fulfilling its office and manifesting its luminosity. When spirit wanes and essence scatters, it is like a person’s death. Thus, when stars fall, they become stone.\n\nZhu Hanshang said: When essence scatters and *qi* wanes, Kan reaches its extreme and Li appears, giving rise to falling stars. Their light illuminates the earth like Li. When they fall as stone, mounds, or dust and sand, it is Gen. Once their radiance disperses, *qi* congeals into stone, much like a person’s corporeal form descending to earth.\n\nThe sun, moon, and Five Stars all originate from the beginning of the Oxherd constellation. This corresponds to the Han *Taichu* calendar’s eleventh month, the first day of the new moon, and the winter solstice. The Han scholar Liu stated: Pointing to the beginning of the Oxherd to mark the sun and moon is called *Xingji* (Star Cycle). The Five Stars begin at the start of the Oxherd, while the sun and moon commence from its midpoint, traversing nearly twelve stations. When they reach the beginning, it marks a solar term; when they reach the midpoint, the Dipper’s handle points below, forming the twelve earthly branches. Observing its position reveals the station. The Han scholar Song Zhong said: The winter solstice begins at the first degree of the Oxherd lodge, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to the *zi* position. Du Yu said: The twelve stations begin with *Xingji* and rotate rightward.\n\nThe *Erya* states: *Xingji* begins with the Oxherd, the Dipper and Oxherd constellations. Guo’s annotation says: The Oxherd and Dipper are where the sun, moon, and Five Stars begin and end. The *Zuo Tradition* does not say “winter solstice” but “the sun’s southernmost point,” referring to the sun’s arrival at the Oxherd from *Chunwei*. At noon, the shadow is longest, revealing its southernmost point at the tip of the Dipper’s handle, threading through the Celestial Palace and marking the Weaving Girl’s station.\n\nThe *Lost Books of Zhou* states: In the eleventh month, when the southern culmination occurs, twilight shifts, the sun treads the long path, and faint stars stir in the Yellow Springs. In this month, the Dipper’s handle begins to point north at dusk, while the sun and moon both rise from the Oxherd, moving rightward. The moon completes a circuit of the heavens, beginning a new station, and meets the sun. The sun traverses one station per month, completing a circuit through the twelve earthly branches, ending only to begin anew—this is called the origin of the sun and moon.\n\nI humbly suggest that the profundities of creation are too subtle to be illuminated without synthesizing multiple explanations. The *Star Canon* poses a difficulty: When observing the canopy’s ribs and wheel spokes, those near the hub are dense, while those farther away grow sparse. Now, the North Pole serves as the celestial hub, and the twenty-eight lodges as the canopy’s ribs. Why, then, are they unevenly spaced? The ribs are modeled after the *Zhou Rituals’* carriage-maker, who crafted twenty-eight canopy bows to represent the stars and wheel spokes to symbolize the sun and moon. The sun and moon meet once a month, completing a circuit of the heavens. The moon then moves to the next station, eventually catching up to the sun and sharing a lodge.\n\nThe heavens are round like two covers joined together, with the North and South Poles as the hubs of the two covers, and the twenty-eight lodges as the canopy’s ribs. The celestial equator encircles the heavens’ midsection like the seam where the two covers meet. The region north of the equator forms the inner enclosure, like the upper cover, while the region south forms the outer enclosure, like the lower cover. The equator lies at the heavens’ center, like the seam. The ecliptic crosses obliquely through the equator. Thus, the spacing of the ribs is narrow near the hubs and widens with distance, just as the degrees of the lodges are narrow near the poles and widen toward the equator, reaching their maximum breadth there.\n\nIn a circular chart, the southern stars appear progressively narrower, yet the opposite occurs. In a horizontal chart, the regions far from both poles appear broad, distorting the true shape of the heavens. Now, if we carve the celestial sphere into two circular charts—one facing upward, the other downward—with the chart’s center as the pole, the region north of the equator becomes the *Neiguan* star chart, while the region south becomes the *Waiguan* star chart. When the two charts are joined, they form a complete celestial sphere, accurately reflecting the varying breadth of the star degrees and ensuring precise divination.\n\nThe North Pole is called the upper circle, the South Pole the lower circle, and the equator encircling the heavens is called the middle circle. The middle circle is broad, while the regions near the two poles are extremely narrow.\n\nOuzi said: In the canopy-heavens theory, southern degrees gradually narrow, while in the celestial-sphere theory, the North Pole is elevated. Both explanations may be left unresolved.\n\nThe *Zhou Rituals*’ *Xingtu* distinguishes the nine provinces by their corresponding stars and boundaries, all of which are recorded in the ritual classics and cannot be erased. There are three interpretations: The *Ling Zhoujiu* states: The station where Jupiter resides determines our *fenye* (field allocation). After the loss of the *Gu Kan* and *Yu Shu*, the regions assigned to commanderies and states no longer align with Jupiter’s ancient positions. Some lie north, others west, differing from the original locations of enfeoffment.\n\nDuring the Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, the ten thousand states and 1,773 polities were all affiliated with the twelve principal states, linking them to the twelve celestial stations. This system honored the ancient kings’ intent to prioritize ancestral sacrifices. For example, Ban Bo was enfeoffed at Shangqiu, which governs the Chen station, hence the Shang star, from which the Shang people derived their name. Shi Shen was enfeoffed at Greater Xia, which governs the Shen station, hence the Xia star, from which the Tang people derived their name. Later, Tang became Jin, and Shen became the Jin star—this is the second interpretation.\n\nNow, consolidating the *fenye* stations and lodges: Qingzhou lies in the east, Xuan’gan in the north, Yong in the west, and *Chunshou* in the south.",
      "overlap_context": " they receive the sun’s light. The *jing* stars are the surplus of Yang *qi*, congealed and flickering, their light unstable. The *wei* stars have rays and points, their inherent light also unmoving, and all receive the sun’s light.”\n\nMaster Zhu also said: “The *jing* stars revolve leftward day and night, completing slightly more than one circuit. Heaven has twelve stations, and now the Weaving Girl star beside the Milky Way ‘seven times daily’—from *mao* to *you*—passes through seven stations.”",

      "translated_text": "Extending to the southeast, Yangzhou aligns with the *Xingji* station in the north; Jizhou in the northeast with *Daliang* in the west; Xuzhou in the east with *Jianglou*; and Yuzhou and the Three Rivers occupy the center, while *Dahuo* resides in the due east. This constitutes the third and most divergent arrangement of the celestial stations and lodges. With three interpretations differing, the discerning must choose for themselves.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: \"The five planets heralded the rise of Zhou.\" *Discourses of the States* records: \"When King Wu campaigned against Shang, Jupiter was in *Chunhuo*, the moon in *Tianxi*, the sun in *Ximu*, the hour in the initial *Dou*, and the star in *Tiandian*.\" I have examined this: when Zhou arose, *Chunhuo* stood directly above the void of *Xuanyuan*, where the *Ji* star was bound. The *Fang* mansion and Jupiter intersected as warp and weft, linking to the divine power of the revered *Shen*—Hou Ji was conceived through this influence. *Chunshou* lay to the right of the mountains and rivers, where King Tai flourished and Hou Ji was enfeoffed. When the Zhou army set forth, the sun stood at ten degrees of *Ji*, the ford of *Ximu*; the moon at four degrees of *Fang*, the chariot of *Shengyang*. Three days later, it was the Zhou’s first month, *gengyin*. On the new moon, sun and moon conjoined at one degree of the Southern Dipper, placing the hour at the Dipper’s handle. At that time, Mars advanced with the Zhou army, while Mercury lay concealed in *Tiandian*, signaling the end of the water phase’s dominion to Emperor Zhuan. From *Tiandian* to *Ximu*, Jupiter reached *Chunhuo*, then retrograded to sojourn in *Chunshou* before advancing again to *Niaofu*. This cyclical traversal, weaving the destiny of the Zhou house, was surely not by human effort. Thus, it was fitting that Zhou endured for thirty generations and eight hundred years, the longest of the sagely dynasties. The celestial portents are luminous—how could they not be trusted? Later ages sought to overcome them by human force—how could this be possible?\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"The twenty-eight lodges are divided among the four directions, seven lodges to each, forming a single image. As creatures and beasts exist on earth, their counterparts reside in heaven. In the east, the Azure Dragon, its head to the south and tail to the north; in the west, the White Tiger, likewise south-headed and north-tailed. In the south, the Vermilion Bird, its head to the west and tail to the east; in the north, the Dark Warrior, west-headed and east-tailed. They proceed from *Jiao* in a leftward revolution.\" The *Erya* notes: \"*Shouxing* begins with *Jiao* and *Kang*.\" Guo’s commentary: \"The count begins at *Jiao*, the eldest of the lodges, hence *Shouxing*.\"\n\nThe seven lodges per direction are as follows: from *Dou* to *Bi* is the *Xingwu* (Dark Warrior); from *Kui* to *Shen*, the *Xinghu* (White Tiger); from *Jing* to *Zhen*, the *Xingniao* (Vermilion Bird); from *Jiao* to *Ji*, the *Xinglong* (Azure Dragon). Arrayed around the four directions, they revolve westward with the heavens. Each direction has its fixed stars, though the stars themselves have no fixed abode, appearing and vanishing in their due seasons.\n\nMaster Lin states: \"*Niaohuo*, *Xu*, and *Xu* mark the solstices and equinoxes at dusk, appearing in the southern sky as the culmination stars of the meridian. In the second month of spring, the seven lodges occupy their respective positions: *Xinghuo* in the east, *Niao* in the south, *Xu* in the west, and *Xu* in the north. When the sun is in *Xu* and enters the *You* quadrant at dusk, *Chunhuo* appears in the southern meridian. At this time, day and night are each fifty *ke*—this is the *qi* of the vernal equinox. By the second month of summer, *Niao* turns west, *Huo* turns south, *Xu* turns east, and *Mao* turns north. When the sun is in *Xing* and enters the *Xin* quadrant at dusk, *Dahuo* (*Fang* and *Xin*) appears in the southern meridian. At this time, days are long and nights short—sixty *ke* for day, forty for night—marking the *qi* of the summer solstice. By the second month of autumn, *Huo* turns west, *Xu* turns south, *Mao* turns east, and *Niao* turns north. When the sun is in *Xin* and enters the *You* quadrant at dusk, *Xu* appears in the meridian. Day and night are again equal—fifty *ke* each—this is the *qi* of the autumnal equinox. By the second month of winter, *Xu* turns west, *Mao* turns south, *Niao* turns east, and *Huo* turns north. When the sun is in *Xu* and enters the *Shen* quadrant at dusk, *Mao* appears in the meridian. Days are short and nights long—forty *ke* for day, sixty for night—marking the *qi* of the winter solstice. Once the *qi* of the solstices and equinoxes are fixed, the *qi* of the twelve months are likewise determined. *Xingniao* refers to the image, *Xinghuo* to the station, *Xu* and *Mao* to the lodges—they complement one another.\"\n\nI observe: the *qi* of heaven, earth, and the four seasons all emanate from the center. *Zi* and *Wu* are the midpoints of the two solstices, the center of heaven and earth. *Mao* and *You* are the midpoints of the two equinoxes, the center of yin and yang. The culmination stars of the twenty-eight lodges reach their zenith at the center. When the sage emerges to harmonize and position heaven and earth, it is simply a matter of holding to the center.\n\nThe star counts of the seven lodges: *Xinglong* has thirty-two stars, *Xingwu* thirty-five, *Xinghu* fifty-one, and *Xingniao* sixty-four. Together, they total 182 stars.\n\nThe degrees of the seven lodges: *Xinglong* spans seventy-five degrees, *Xingwu* ninety-eight and one-quarter degrees, *Xinghu* eighty degrees, and *Xingniao* one hundred twenty degrees. Combined, they form the celestial circle of 365¼ degrees. Each degree measures 2,933 *li*, divided into twelve stations.\n\nThe *fenye* divisions of the seven lodges:\nFrom eleven degrees of *Dou* to seven degrees of *Nü* (also called *Xunü*) is the station *Xingji*. The celestial branch is *Chou*, called *Chifenif*, corresponding to the pitch *Huangzhong*. *Dou* points to *Zi*—this is the division of present-day Wu and Yue.\nFrom eight degrees of *Nü* to sixteen degrees of *Wei* is the station *Xuangan* (also called *Tiandian*). The celestial branch is *Zi*, called *Kundun*, corresponding to the pitch *Dalü*. *Dou* points to *Chou*—this is the division of present-day Qi.\nFrom seventeen degrees of *Wei* to four degrees of *Kui* is the station *Shiwei* (also called *Zouzi*).

The first lodge is the ancestral temple, *Di* is the root of heaven, *Fang* is the celestial palace, *Xin* is the Hall of Light, *Wei* is the filial son, and *Ji* is the guest. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The Azure Dragon coils on the left.\" The left is the Green Dragon, belonging to Wood and residing in the East. Further divided into lesser images: in the *Seven Stars* system, *Jiao* of Wood is the *Jiao* dragon, *Kang* of Metal is the dragon, *Di* of Earth is the *Mo*, *Fang* of the Sun is the hare, *Xin* of the Moon is the fox, *Wei* of Fire is the tiger, and *Ji* of Water is the leopard. The sun and moon reside within, while the five planets weave without. *Ximu* converges at *Yin*, *Dahuo* at *Mao*, and *Shouxing* at *Chen*.\n\n*Jiao*: Two stars, serving as the Celestial Gate. Between them lies the Gate of Heaven, within which is the Celestial Court. The ecliptic passes through its midst, where the seven luminaries traverse. The left horn of the dragon is the Celestial Field, governing law and punishment. The right horn is the general, commanding the army. When the stars are bright and large, the king’s Way flourishes, and the worthy hold court. If *Yinghuo* (Mars) trespasses the Celestial Field, drought ensues. As recorded in the *Treatise on Sacrifices*: \"The Han founder established the shrine of the Spirit Star.\"\n\n*Kang*: Four stars, the inner court of the Son of Heaven. It serves as the ancestral temple, governing epidemics and overseeing all memorials, lawsuits, trials, and the recording of merits. *Di*: Four stars, the lodging of the king and the palace of the queen and consorts. The two front stars are the primary wives, the two rear stars the concubines. The *Shanzi* states: \"When the Root of Heaven appears, the waters dry up.\" The *Erya* says: \"*Di* is the Root of Heaven.\" Below *Jiao* and *Kang*, it connects to the people like the root of a tree.

      "translated_text": "**Fang**: Four stars, the Hall of Light, the office from which the Son of Heaven promulgates governance. The central space is the Celestial Thoroughfare; when the Seven Luminaries pass through it, the Son of Heaven is at peace. It is also the Celestial Steed and Heavenly Horses, governing chariots and carriages. The *Guoyu* states: \"The Agricultural Auspice.\" At dawn, when the sun and moon align with the Celestial Temple, the earth begins to stir. The *Sui Treatise* says: \"When the Five Weft Stars enter Fang, the rise of King Wen of Zhou commences.\"\n\n**Xin**: Three stars, the true seat of the Celestial King. The central star is the Hall of Light, where the Son of Heaven, as the Great Star, administers rewards and punishments. The front star is the Crown Prince, the rear star the lesser sons. The Great Fire is the Great Star; only when the great cold and heat recede does it retreat. The *Treatise on Pitch Pipes* says: \"Xin signifies the flowering of the myriad things.\" The *Tang Treatise* states: \"In the *Book of Changes*, 'Thunder follows Qian' is called *Great Strength*, symbolized by Fang.\" Xin is the essence of Qian, just as Fang is the ascending yang steed. Fang is where the sun and moon reside. The *Divine Mandate in Sequence* says: \"When Jupiter guards Xin, the year’s grain is abundant.\" The *Hongfan* states: \"Zhonghua refers to Jupiter in Xin.\" Jupiter is also called *Sheti* and *Zhonghua*. The *Zuozhuan* says: \"Xin is Fire.\" In the fifth month, fire first appears at dusk. The *Book of Songs* says: \"Three stars are in the heavens.\"\n\n**Wei**: The first of nine stars in Wei is the Empress; the next three stars are the consorts, and the following star represents the secondary concubines. The adjacent star is called the Divine Palace. The tail of the Azure Dragon represents the nine sons, their colors uniform and bright. When the rear palace is harmonious, there are many descendants. On *bingzi* and *chen* days, the Dragon’s Tail lies hidden to the left of *chen*. Wei signifies the life and death of the myriad things, like a tail.\n\n**Ji**: Four stars, the rear palace and the residence of the Empress and consorts. It is also the Dragon’s Tail, the Guest of Ceremony, governing speech and disputes. It is also called the Celestial Ford, ruling the Eight Winds. When the sun and moon lodge in Ji, they are northeast of the Eastern Wall. The *Yi* and *Si* winds arise above, and the Quail constellation follows. It is also said: \"Fu Yue rides the tail of Ji, ranked among the stars.\" The *Jin Treatise* states: \"Fu Yue is one star behind Wei.\" The *Mao Commentary on the Book of Songs* says: \"Ji is in the south and the Dipper in the north, hence 'Southern Ji, Northern Dipper.'\" I have once compared the hexagrams: the dragon belongs to the east, to *Zhen*. *Zhen* moves beneath the heavy yin, like a tortoise exhaling qi. The serpent rises—none are as adept at transformation as the dragon. The hexagrams align after the Spring Equinox, when *chen* is the station of the Azure Dragon. Movement brings change, so the dragon ascends at the Spring Equinox, rising as thunder, bursting forth from the earth. At the Autumn Equinox, it descends into the Thunder Marsh, embodying the image of *Guimei*. In midsummer, fierce thunder uproots trees and the dragon ascends. *Zhen* Wood occupies the position of *mao*. *Kang* is called the Dragon, akin to thunder. In the profound, the third in sequence is the dragon. Diviners take *jia*, *yi*, *yin*, and *mao* as the dragon. In celestial patterns, *Jiao* is the flood dragon, *Kang* the dragon, and *Yi* the earthworm. *Jiao* and *Kang* are *chen*; *Yi* is *si*. From the Spring Equinox to the Grain in Ear, *Zhen* governs, and *chen* and *si* are called *Yi*: the dispersal of qi. Fang is the Celestial Steed and the station of the Azure Dragon, hence horses are also called dragon-horses. The *Treatise* says: \"When the Five Weft Stars enter Fang, the rise of King Wen of Zhou begins\"—this too is an auspicious omen of a rising king. The saying that five horses transform into a dragon also originates here. Its symbols—the Celestial Field, the Agricultural Auspice, and many sons—all correspond to the spring of the east.\n\nThe Western Palace’s *Xianchi*:\n- **Kui** is the Ditch and Dike.\n- **Lou** is the Gathering Spring.\n- **Wei** is the Celestial Granary.\n- **Mao** is the White Robe.\n- **Bi** and **Hui** are the Frontier Troops.\n- **Zi** and **Nao** are the Tiger’s Head.\n- **Shen** is the Reaping.\n\nThe *Ling Xian* says: \"The White Tiger fiercely occupies the right.\" The White Tiger, belonging to Metal, resides in the west and is further divided into lesser images. The Seven Stars of the household:\n- **Kui Wood** is the Wolf.\n- **Lou Metal** is the Dog.\n- **Wei Earth** is the Pheasant.\n- **Mao Sun** is the Rooster.\n- **Bi Moon** is the Crow.\n- **Zi Fire** is the Monkey.\n- **Shen Water** is the Ape.\n\nThe sun and moon dwell at the center, the Five Stars weave outside. *Jiang Lou* meets *xu*, *Da Liang* meets *you*, and *Shi Shen* meets *shen*.\n\n**Kui**: Sixteen stars, the Celestial Armory. Also called the Celestial Boar or the Sealed Boar. It governs military affairs and suppresses violence, as well as canals and ditches. The *Monthly Ordinances* state: \"In the second spring month, the moon is in Kui; in late summer, Kui culminates at dawn.\"\n\n**Lou**: Three stars, the Celestial Prince, governing parks, livestock, and sacrificial offerings for suburban rites and grand feasts. When bright, the realm is at peace. The *Tang Treatise* says: \"When the sun meets Lou, great ministers are in distress.\"\n\n**Wei**: Three stars, the Celestial Kitchen, the granary of the Five Grains. When active, there are matters of transport; when bright, the realm is at peace. In late spring, the sun is in Wei.\n\n**Mao**: Seven stars, the Celestial Ear, governing judicial affairs in the west. Also the Hairy-Headed Hu Star; when bright, the realm’s prisons are just. The *Book of Documents* says: \"The day is short at the Mao star.\"\n\n**Bi**: Eight stars, the Net of Bi governs frontier troops, hunting, and distant military campaigns.

The *Lü* hexagram speaks of \"treading on a tiger’s tail\"—its inner trigram is *Dui*. The *Ge* hexagram speaks of \"the tiger’s transformation\"—its outer trigram is *Dui*. The *Yi* hexagram speaks of \"the tiger’s gaze, fixed and fierce\"—it contains a hidden *Dui*. The *Image* states: \"*Shen* is the White Tiger\"—*Shen* is *Shen* (the zodiacal sign). *Shen* occupies the Tiger’s head, wielding the power of execution and slaughter. To the east lies the Great Wolf, and the wolf is also of the tiger kind—thus it is considered a celestial general star. Among the Seven Mansions, some correspond to the Armory or Celestial Granary, aligning with the autumn of gathering and contraction.\n\nIn the Southern Palace, the Vermilion Bird: *Jing* governs water affairs, *Gui* governs sacrificial rites, *Liu* is the Bird, governing plants and trees, *Xing* is the Great Fire, governing urgent matters, *Zhang* is the Plain Kitchen, governing feasts and guests, *Yi* is the Wings, governing distant guests, and *Zhen* is the Chariot, governing wind.\n\nThe *Spiritual Constitution* states: \"The Vermilion Bird spreads its wings in the front.\" The front is the Vermilion Bird, belonging to fire and residing in the south. Further subdividing its minor images: among the Seven Stars’ household, *Jing*’s wood is the *Jie* (reed), *Gui*’s metal is the sheep, *Liu*’s earth is the river deer, *Xing*’s sun is the horse, *Zhang*’s moon is the deer, and *Yi*’s fire is the sun. In late autumn, at dawn, *Liu* culminates. The sun and moon reside in the center, the Five Planets weave externally, the Quail’s Tail meets *Si*, the Quail’s Fire meets *Wu*, and the Quail’s Head meets *Wei*.\n\n**Jing**: Eight stars, the Celestial Watchtower, governing waterways and legal standards for fairness. The *Justice* states: \"East of *Shen* lies the King’s Well.\" Thus it is said: \"When the Eastern Well’s Dragon King upholds the law with fairness, the Well stars shine brightly and align properly, governing the capital’s jurisdiction.\" It is also said: \"When *Yinghuo* (Mars) trespasses the Eastern Well, drought follows.\"\n\n**Gui**: Five stars, the Celestial Eye, governing keen insight and the detection of treachery. When bright, the Five Grains flourish. It is also said to govern death and mourning.\n\n**Liu**: Eight stars, the Celestial Steward, governing imperial cuisine and the discernment of flavors. It also governs thunder and rain, being the Vermilion Bird’s beak—thus it is called the Bird’s Peck. The *Erya* states: \"The *Wei* (flavor) is called *Liu* (willow), which is the beak.\" It is also written as *Zhou* (啄, peck). The *Zuozhuan* states: \"*Wei* is the Great Fire.\" The *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: \"It is the Bird’s Beak, governing plants and trees.\" Moreover, in late summer, the sun resides in *Liu*; in late autumn, at dawn, *Liu* culminates.\n\n**Xing**: Seven stars, also called the Celestial Capital, governing garments and embroidered patterns. The seven stars also form the neck.\n\n**Zhang**: Six stars, the Plain Kitchen, the bird’s feeding ground, governing treasures and ancestral temple offerings. It oversees imperial banquets, rewards, and punishments—when bright, the kingly Way prospers. The *Han Records* state: \"It governs feasts and guests.\" The *Jin Records* state: \"*Zhu Zhang* is the Crow Star, thus it governs insects.\"\n\n**Yi**: Twenty-two stars, the Celestial Music Bureau, governing entertainers and distant guests from the barbarian lands beyond the seas. When bright, grand rituals and music flourish; when active, envoys from the Four Barbarians arrive, or the Son of Heaven mobilizes troops. *Yi* governs feathers and elegance, overseeing distant matters.\n\n**Zhen**: Four stars, the Chariot, governing cavalry and carriages, as well as burdens and tasks. When armies march or return, divination is performed at the *Jiao* (linchpin). It also governs the Prime Minister and assisting ministers, and is called the Bird’s Tail. It further governs wind, sharing the same position as *Xun*. Another name is *Yi* (轶), the head.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the *Book of Changes* associates *Li* with the southern quadrant, forming the image of the Flying Bird—the Vermilion Bird. The histories speak of \"flowing fire as the bird\" and \"the crow in the sun.\" *Wu* is the Quail’s Fire, *Wei* is the Quail’s Head, and *Si* is the Quail’s Tail. Its flavor resides in *Liu*, and its wings in *Yi*. *Liu* is *Wu* (the zodiacal sign), *Li*; *Yi* is *Si*, *Xun*. Fu Chuqiu, in his commentary on the *Mingyi* hexagram’s *Modesty*, states: \"The arriving bird is the Vermilion Bird.\" The *Gui Cang*’s initial *Xun* states: \"A bird will come, drooping its wings.\" *Yi* is the Quail’s Tail, hence it is called the Flying Bird. Birds of the quail and pheasant kind, such as the peacock of Lingnan, cling to the grass when they fly.",
      "overlap_context": "pring, the sun is in *Wei*.\n\n**Mao**: Seven stars, the Celestial Ear, governing judicial affairs in the west. Also the Hairy-Headed Hu Star; when bright, the realm’s prisons are just. The *Book of Documents* says: \"The day is short at the *Mao* star.\"\n\n**Bi**: Eight stars, the Net of *Bi* governs frontier troops, hunting, and distant military campaigns. The Yellow Road passes through it; when the Son of Heaven travels, he raises the banner. The Net of *Bi* leads the way—this is its significance.",

      "translated_text": "The Seven Stars form the Horse, corresponding to *chen* (the fifth earthly branch) as *wu* (noon), thus the Horse belongs to fire. Domestic animals born under *wu* are of the fire phase, and the silkworm is the Horse’s head—the essence of the Dragon Star. Therefore, horses and silkworms share the same *qi*, just as crabs, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles all bear yellow markings, which pertain to *Li* (fire). Among the Seven Mansions, there is the Ghost Chariot. The Seven Stars of the Celestial Eye govern embroidery and patterned fabrics, all corresponding to the image of *Li* in the southern quadrant, radiant and luminous.\n\nThe Northern Palace’s Dark Warrior (*Xuanwu*) has the Southern Dipper as its temple, the Oxherd as its sacrificial offering, and the Weaving Maiden as the Celestial Granddaughter. The Girl (of the *Xu* mansion) governs matters of weeping and lamentation, *Wei* (the Rooftop) governs roofing, the Encampment governs the ancestral temple, and the Eastern Wall governs literature and scholarship. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The sacred turtle coils its head behind, and what lies behind is *Xuanwu*, which belongs to water and resides in the north.\" Further subdivisions of the constellations include: in the Seven Stars mansion, *Doumu* is the cricket; *Niuxin* is the ox; *Nü* is the bat; *Xu* is the rat; *Wei* is the swallow; and *Yingshi* is the wall lizard.\n\nThe sun and moon reside at the center, while the five planets weave their paths beyond. *Xuanleng* converges at *zi* (midnight), *Xingji* at *chou* (the ox), and *Zouzi* at *hai* (the pig). The Southern Dipper consists of six stars, the Celestial Temple, and also marks the span of longevity. It further represents the positions of the Prime Minister and Grand Steward, governing rewards, promotions, the advancement of the worthy, and the bestowal of ranks and emoluments. It also commands military affairs. The two southern stars are the Celestial Beam, the two central stars the Celestial Minister, and the two northern stars the Celestial Treasury. When the stars of the Dipper shine brightly, the king’s Way is harmonious and peaceful. As the tradition states: \"When the *chen* (celestial stem) aligns with the Dipper’s handle, the sun and moon meet at the Southern Dipper.\"\n\nThe Ox consists of six stars, the Celestial Pass and Bridge, governing sacrificial affairs. The *Hou Zhi* states: \"The movement of the seven luminaries begins with the Oxherd.\" These three stars are the River Drum, also called the Oxherd. The *Lü Shu* says of the Oxherd: \"Yang *qi* moves, and the myriad things emerge.\" The *Bo Wu Zhi* records: \"Zhang Qian rode a raft to explore the source of the Yellow River.\" Yan Junping divined that a guest star trespassed upon the Ox and Dipper. It is also said: \"When Venus invades the Oxherd, the general meets with misfortune.\"\n\nThe Maid consists of four stars, also called the Bearded Maiden, governing cloth, silk, tailoring, and marriage. *Xu* is the term for a lowly concubine, the most humble of women’s duties. To its north lies the Weaving Maiden, the Celestial Granddaughter. The Void governs the northern settlements, the ancestral temple, and matters of sacrificial prayers and invocations. It also governs weeping and lamentation, as well as the office of the Chief Minister. The *Book of Documents* states: \"At the first watch, the star *Xu* culminates.\" The Rooftop consists of three stars governing the Celestial Treasury and Celestial Market, with *Wei* as the Black Ridgepole—a spirit of depletion, as is the Void.\n\nThe Encampment consists of two stars, the palace of the Son of Heaven. It also serves as the granary for military provisions and governs earthworks. When its stars shine brightly, the nation prospers. One name for it is the Dark Palace, another the Pure Temple. The two stars of the Encampment are called *Ding* (Stability). *Ding* means \"correct,\" governing earthworks. The *Book of Songs* says: \"*Ding* is rightly in the center.\" The Eastern Wall consists of two stars governing literature and the secret treasury of the world’s books. The *Commentary on the Book of Songs* states: \"The Wall is the outer courtyard of the Encampment.\" When the Winnowing Basket is in the south, the Wall lies to the east of the Encampment, hence it is called the Eastern Wall. When its stars shine brightly, the king’s rule flourishes, the Way of the state is luminous, and the land abounds with noble men. If Jupiter guards it, the five grains suffer damage from water. The *Monthly Ordinances* state: \"In mid-winter, the Eastern Wall culminates at dusk.\"\n\nComparing this with the *Book of Changes*, the Dipper originally belongs to the north as *Kan* (Water), and the Northern Palace’s turtle shape is its fundamental image. It is further divided into two creatures, the turtle and the snake, within the treasure, with *Kan* as the fox. Yu Fan takes *Gen* (the mountain) as the fox, while the *Tian Wen* takes the Heart as the fox—these interpretations diverge. The *Yun Dou Shu* states: \"The Jade Pivot scatters to become the rat.\" The Jade Pivot is the star of the Dipper, also belonging to *Kan*. The Oxherd lies in *chou* (the ox), its northern star the River Drum, also called the Oxherd. It signifies the movement of yang *qi* and the emergence of the myriad things. The four stars of the Bearded Maiden are base, while the three stars of the Weaving Maiden are noble—the concubine and the Celestial Granddaughter belong to different ranks.\n\nThe Celestial Prison consists of six stars beneath the Dipper’s bowl, the prison of the noble. The Chain of Nine Stars lies before the Summoning Star, the prison of the common people. Among the seven northern mansions, many pertain to ancestral temples and sacrificial prayers, for the north is the dark and hidden realm, the dwelling place of ghosts and spirits. The governance of palaces, women’s work, and the correspondence to winter’s season reflect the extreme of yin giving rise to yang, which is why the constellations all begin with the Oxherd’s inception.\n\nThe Central Palace’s Celestial Pole consists of five stars, and the Curved Array of six stars, all residing within the Purple Palace as the most exalted. The *Ling Xian* states: \"The Yellow Spirit, Xuanyuan, resides at the center.\" The fifth of the ten celestial stems, *wu* and *ji*, belongs to earth and corresponds to the five stars of the Celestial Pole. The sixth of the twelve earthly branches, *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, belongs to earth and corresponds to the six stars of the Curved Array. In heaven, it is the celestial stem; on earth, it is soil, which is why Master Zhang refers to it as the Yellow Spirit. Its days are the five offices, five times seven making thirty-five.\n\nThe names derive from the seven stars of the Northern Dipper as the Emperor’s Chariot, which steers the revolutions of creation. The five stars of the Celestial Pole—astrologers speak of the Four Emperors flanking the Yellow Emperor’s central seat: the Eastern Emperor, *Weilingyang*; the Southern Emperor, *Chipi’ao*; the Western Emperor, *Zizhaoqu*#18; and the Northern Emperor, *Xuguangji*. These correspond to the *Monthly Ordinances*’ wood, fire, metal, and water, with central earth making five. Some ask: \"Heaven is one, yet there are five emperors—why?\" The answer is: This merely borrows the names of rulers to describe the *qi* of the five phases, each with its own governance.\n\nThe Curved Array consists of six stars, an earthly image, for the number of *kun* (earth) is six. The single star in its mouth is called the Heavenly August Emperor, governing the numinous. The four stars embracing the Pole’s pivot are called the Four Assistants. The *Sui Zhi* states: \"They reside within the Purple Tenuity Palace.\" Ban Gu says: \"The Zhou dynasty took the position of the Curved Array, for earth resides at the center of the five phases, and the *qi* of the four seasons is complete within it. The Curved Array dwells amid the Dragon, Tiger, Quail, and Turtle, and thus governs creatures of fur, feathers, scales, and shells from all four directions. Is this not why it serves as the guardian of the Central Palace?\" The *Ling Xian* states: \"In court, it resembles officials; in man, it resembles affairs.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Three Terraces Six stars rise in pairs, called the Heavenly Pillars. In man, they are the Three Dukes; in heaven, they are the Three Terraces. The first two stars of Wenchang are the Upper Terrace, serving as the Controller of Destiny and governing longevity. The next two stars are the Middle Terrace, serving as the Controller of the Center and governing the imperial clan. The last two stars to the east are the Lower Terrace, serving as the Controller of Emoluments and governing the military.\n\nThey are also called the Heavenly Stairway, by which the Great One ascends and descends. Another name is the Grand Stairway. The upper star of the upper step is the Son of Heaven, and the lower star is the queen. The upper star of the middle step is the feudal lords, and the lower star is the ministers and grand masters. The upper star of the lower step is the scholar-officials, and the lower star is the common people.\n\nIt is also said: the Upper Terrace’s Controller of Destiny is the Grand Commandant, the Middle Terrace’s Controller of the Center is the Minister of Education, and the Lower Terrace’s Controller of Emoluments is the Minister of Works. When the colors of the Three Terraces are uniform, lord and minister are in harmony; when uneven, discord and perversity arise. When the Three Steps are level, yin and yang are harmonized, wind and rain are timely, the spirits of soil and grain receive their due, and the world enjoys great peace.\n\nThe Six Signs are the signs and proofs of the six stars. The Wenchang Constellation consists of six stars located before the Dipper’s *kui*. They are the Six Signs of Heaven, governing the gathering and reckoning of the heavenly Dao. The *Historical Records* states: \"The Dipper’s *kui* bears the two generals, and the three nobles assist.\" The Controller is the same as the Three Terraces’ Controller of the Center.\n\nThe Five Stars of the *Shangshu* serve as the Heavenly Throat and Tongue, measuring and harmonizing the primordial *qi*, regulating the four seasons, and bestowing unified governance upon the four seas to jointly rule the world.\n\nThe Four Stars of Shaowei occupy the position of the scholar-officials in the Supreme Subtlety. The first is called the Recluse, or sometimes the Erudite. The first star south of the office is the Recluse, the second is the Counselor, and the third is the Grand Master. When bright and yellow, worthy talent is promoted.\n\nThe Fifteen Stars of the Gentlemen-Officials lie northeast of the Imperial Throne, also called the Office of the Raven-Dependent Gentlemen. In the *Rites of Zhou*, they are the primary officers; in the Han, they are the Gentlemen of the Palace, the Dispersed Gentlemen, and the Gentlemen of Remonstrance—such are their duties.\n\nThe Star of Transmitted Sayings lies behind the Winnowing Basket and Tail, governing prayers and invocations, and is the office of shamans. I humbly suggest that one star corresponds to those in court, and the star preceding the office is the Grand Invocator. The Invocator is the shaman’s office.\n\nThus, the Three Terraces correspond to the Three Dukes, the six stars of Wenchang to the *Shangshu*, the six stars north of the Dipper to the Heavenly Throat and Tongue, and the *Shangshu* likewise to the king’s throat and tongue. Heaven has the Star of Transmitted Sayings, and man has the minister of transmitted sayings; heaven has Wang Liang driving the horses, and man has Wang Liang the skilled charioteer.

The *Book of Songs* says: “It makes its pattern in the heavens.”\n\nThe Weaving Girl: three stars, the Celestial Granddaughter, governing fruits, ferns, silk, precious treasures, and marriage rites. The *Book of Songs* says: “All day she moves seven times.” The Celestial Granddaughter weaves cloud-brocade robes.\n\nThe Martial Star: the Celestial General. Twelve stars north of Lou, governing military affairs. The central great star is the Celestial Grand Commander; the outer small stars are his officers and soldiers. When the Grand General trembles, armies rise and the great commander marches forth. When the small stars are incomplete, troops are not dispatched.\n\nThe Gentleman of the Court: one star, in the Gentleman’s Station, with the north as the armory.\n\nThe Cavalry Office: twenty-seven stars, in the region of Di. The southern stars represent the Son of Heaven; the Tiger Nobles govern the night watch.\n\nThe Tiger Warriors: one star, north of the Supreme Subtlety, the mounted guardsmen at the palace gate.\n\nThe Feathered Forest: forty-five stars, south of the Encampment, also called the Celestial Army.\n\nThe Ramparts: twelve stars, north of the Feathered Forest, the walls of the Feathered Forest. The positions of the Three Armies form the Encampment.\n\nThe Banner of Orion: nine stars, west of Shen. Also called the Celestial Banner, the bow. It governs the drawing of crossbows and watches for omens.\n\nThe Nine Pennants: nine stars to the southwest, the Son of Heaven’s banner.\n\nThe Left and Right Banners: nine stars each, north of Qianniu, the Celestial Drums. Also called the Three Martial Grand Generals, stationed between the left and right commanders. The nine stars beside the drums serve as standards. The River Drum stars are also called Qianniu—this is incorrect. The *Sui Treatise* states: the River Drum comprises three stars. The *Tang Astral Treatise* says: the River Drum is the symbol of the general.\n\nThe Celestial Lance: three stars, east of the Dipper’s handle, also called the Celestial Halberd, the celestial armory.\n\nThe Bow: nine stars, southeast of the Wolf, the Celestial Bow. It governs defense against bandits.\n\nThe Celestial Clubs: five stars, the Son of Heaven’s vanguard. They quell strife, repel adversity, and guard against the unforeseen. If one star is missing, the nation’s armies rise.\n\nThe Beckoning Star: one star, corresponding to the Dipper, through which the Hu receive the Mandate from the Central Kingdom. If it shines brightly but not upright, the Hu will not receive the Mandate.\n\nThe Celestial Stables: ten stars of the Eastern Wall, called the Celestial Trough. They govern the office of horses, post stations, and water clocks, running in tandem with sundials.\n\nWang Liang: the Celestial Team of Four, one star called Wang Liang, filling the fields with honored chariots and cavalry. The *Jin Treatise* states: Wang Liang is also called the Celestial Horse; Liang is also the Celestial Bridge. Thus, it may portend chariots and cavalry, or fords and bridges. I humbly say: the concurrent use of civil and martial arts is the Way of long endurance. Yet in the court, the Gentlemen of the Court number fifteen stars, while in the wilds, the Gentleman General is but one star—such is the celestial instruction to mankind.\n\nThe People’s Star: the Chamber Star as the Agricultural Auspice. Among the seven stars in the east, when the sun stands at midday on the day of the Beginning of Spring, the star is centered—this is the Agricultural Auspice. Its omen is the ripening of all grains.\n\nThe Agricultural Minister: southwest of the Southern Dipper, the Elder Farmer governs cultivation.\n\nThe Celestial Rooster: it heralds the seasons to hasten plowing.\n\nQianniu: Zhang Qian, riding a raft, saw the Cowherd plowing east of the river and the Weaving Girl weaving west of it. Though the tale is not attested, it benefits the world’s teachings—how much more so, as the Seven Luminaries rise in Qianniu. The Dao brings forth yang qi, as stated in the *Erya*. The River Drum and Qianniu are one star—so say Li Xun and Sun Yan. Li says: the name of the twenty-eight lunar lodgings; Sun says: the River Drum lies north of Qianniu.\n\nThe Plow’s Curve: nine stars. Six are large and bright; the remaining three are small and dim. When plowing, the handle points upward.\n\nThe Celestial Fields: nine stars, south of the Oxherd. Also said: the left horn of the Azure Dragon is the Celestial Fields.\n\nThe Water Office: southwest of the Eastern Well, governing the office of waters.\n\nThe Net Dam: nine stars east of Qianniu, damming floodwaters for irrigation.\n\nThe Four Rivers: the stars of the Jiang, the He, and the Ji.",

      "translated_text": "The South Pole Star appears at *bing* on the autumnal equinox and sets at *ding* on the vernal equinox. When visible, it heralds governance in peace and prosperity; when absent, it foretells the outbreak of war.\n\n**Celestial Nipple**\nOne star north of *Kang* is called the Celestial Nipple, governing sweet dew.\n\n**Gezai**\nIt resembles a flame of fire, yellow-white, rising from the earth, broad below and tapering above. When it appears, there will be harvests without plowing, yet great misfortune will follow if no earthworks are undertaken.\n\n**Auspicious Star**\nA star of virtue, also called the Celestial Gleam. It regularly emerges over states of the Dao, born at the dark and new moons, aiding the moon’s brightness. *Li* means radiance: a red directional *qi* connects with a green directional *qi*. Within the red *qi* are two yellow stars; within the green *qi* is one yellow star. These three stars together form the Auspicious Star.\n\n**Celestial Altar**\nSix stars south of *Yu Gui* are called the Celestial Altar. Its position is *kun*, its *qi* is *wei*, and its spirit is the son of Gonggong. Gou Long pacified water and earth, so sacrifices were made to his essence, which became a star.\n\n**Celestial Millet Star**\nFive stars south of the Seven Stars. Millet is the minister of agriculture, taking the chief of the five grains as its name.\n\n**Celestial Temple**\nFifteen stars south of *Zhang* are called the Celestial Temple, the ancestral temple of the Son of Heaven. *Xu* and *Wei* govern the *qi* of ancestral temples and descendants.\n\nI say: The merit of the people begins with Hou Ji. By exerting effort in agriculture to match Heaven, the Auspicious Star appears and sweet dew descends. The celestial signs are clear—how can this not be true?\n\nShaozi said: Stars belong to the day.\n*The Essential Meaning* states: Day and night divide the clepsydra’s marks.\nMa Shi said: Fifty marks for day, fifty for night, based on sunrise and sunset.\nCai Yong said: Stars appear at night. The three marks after sunset and before sunrise belong to the day. Thus, day has fifty-six marks, night forty-four.\nZheng said: The sun at midday is taken as the day; when visible, the clepsydra marks fifty-three, when not, forty-five—differing from Cai by one mark.\n\nI observe: Shaozi takes *li* as stars, stars as day, and *chen* as night. When the sun rises, stars fade; when the sun sets, stars emerge—this is plain to all. Thus, this defines day and night.\n\n**Celestial Changes**\nThe five planets move in degrees, intertwining with the seven luminaries. Distributed across the four directions, they proclaim fortune and misfortune. Thus it is said: When the constant order is disrupted, stars and planets move erratically.\n\nJupiter moves one-twelfth of a degree per day, completing a celestial cycle in twelve years.\nMars moves one-thirty-third of a degree per day, completing a cycle in thirty-three years.\nSaturn moves one-twenty-eighth of a degree per day, completing a cycle in twenty-eight years.\nVenus moves one-eighth of a degree per day, completing a cycle in eight years.\nMercury moves one degree per day, completing a cycle in one year.\n\nThese are the degrees traversed by the five planets, which together with the twenty-eight lodges form the celestial body. Any deviation brings floods and droughts in the heavens, calamities among people, and the rise and fall of states. If one cultivates virtue to avert them, one may yet escape harm. Otherwise, the accumulation of minute errors leads to great consequences—how can this not be feared?\n\nNow, the celestial changes are briefly outlined below.\n\n**Comet Changes**\n*The Gongyang Commentary* states: A star that trails at the Great Fire is a comet.\nHe Xiu said: It is the *qi* of disorder, symbolizing the sweeping away of the old and the establishment of the new.\nThe *Apocrypha* states: Its form is a *zhang* long, and comets have five colors.\nIf green, the feudal lords will be broken;\nif red, powerful states will act wantonly;\nif white, great wars will erupt.\n\nI have examined their changes in detail:\nIn the time of Duke Wen of Lu, a comet appeared in the Northern Dipper, and later Chu, as a barbarian, deeply invaded the Central States.\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, the Marquis of Qi performed a comet-averting ritual.\nYanzi said: It cannot be done. This is Heaven’s teaching to the people; the people will scatter and flee.\n\nDuring the fifteenth year of the First Emperor of Qin, comets appeared four times, some stretching across the sky. He then conquered the six states, repelled the four barbarians, and the dead piled like hemp.\nIn the fifth year of Emperor Wu’s *Yuanguang* reign (130 BCE), in the seventh month, a comet entered the Eastern Palace, reaching the favored ministers, and lingered for over fifty days—an omen of the eunuch Zhao Zhong’s treacherous disorder.\nIn the second year of Emperor Ai’s *Jianping* reign (5 BCE), in the third month, a comet emerged in *Qianniu* and remained for over seventy days, ultimately foreshadowing Wang Mang’s usurpation of the state.\n\nIn the *Jiazi* year of Emperor Lizong’s *Jingding* reign (1264), a comet appeared in *Liu* Lodge, with the pitch matching *Kuibin*, in the *Chunhuo* mansion. Its baleful flames stretched halfway across the sky for over seventy days.\nOnly the Secretariat Drafter again memorialized: The comet’s trespass on *Liu* Lodge is an extraordinary and ominous sign. The administrative path and the prison bureau—this is the star of the gate and its attendants. Now, with Kong Guang and Cui Lie transformed into a comet, the *Ganquan* method follows, and the stars of *Wenchang* and the Canopy are implicated. Now, with Yuan Ji and Gong Yu transformed into a comet, the stars of the Remonstrance Bureau and the Censorate are implicated. Now, with the phoenix’s song turning to the cicada’s chirp, and the steeds of the imperial stables fed with moss, they are transformed into a comet—yet there is an even greater comet. For Shang Yang’s ministerial achievements and emphasis on merit and profit, for Wang Anshi’s monopolization of power and claim that celestial changes are not to be feared—this cuts to the heart of the times’ maladies. Alas! The words were not heeded, and within a decade, the state perished. How lamentable!\n\n**Chi You’s Banner Changes**\nResembling a comet but curved like a banner, yellow above and white below, it is the essence of Mars. When seen, the Son of Heaven will campaign against the four directions.\n\n**Heavenly Dog Falling to Earth**\nIts form is like a great meteor, with a sound like thunder, its light resembling fire, blazing in the sky. When it falls to earth, it resembles a dog. Its base is round, like a field of several *qing*. Its top is sharp, and within a thousand *li*, armies are broken and generals slain.\nMeng said: It is also the essence of Venus.\n\nVenus’s passage across the sky has variations of excess and deficiency. Excess and deficiency mean: when the sun is in the south, Venus is in the south; when the sun is in the north, Venus is in the north. When in excess, feudal lords are unsettled; in warfare, advance is auspicious, retreat inauspicious.",

      "translated_text": "When the sun is in the south, Venus is in the north; when the sun is in the north, Venus is in the south. This is called \"deficiency.\" The lord and ruler will have worries; in warfare, retreat is auspicious, advance inauspicious.\n\nMoreover, when Venus is in the south and Jupiter in the north, it is called \"the male and female.\" The year’s grain will be abundant. If it should emerge but does not, or should enter but does not, it will not break the state but will cause its downfall.\n\nWhen Venus crosses the sky, it is the yang of the sun. When the sun rises, the stars vanish; if it appears at noon, it is called \"crossing the sky.\" Contending with the sun for brightness is called \"disordering the celestial order.\" The world will undergo revolution, the people will change rulers, and the populace will flee. The strong will weaken, the small will grow strong. The female ruler will prosper—Wang Mang, the Earthly Emperor—when Venus is in the Supreme Subtlety, illuminating the earth like moonlight. The Supreme Subtlety is the court of the Son of Heaven. In that year, great armies entered the Son of Heaven’s court, advancing to the Gradual Terrace, where Wang Mang’s head was struck off.\n\nI say: These two stars do not necessarily retreat far. In the autumn of the *gengwu* year, the Heavenly Dog star fell. Soon after, a great general was slain. In the summer of the *jichou* year, Venus crossed the sky. The following year, the White Wave Rebellion arose, along with the previous *jiazi* year’s three great comet-like omens. At seventy years of age, I witnessed all these with my own eyes, and so I record them here.\n\nVenus governs warfare; Mars governs internal strife. The moon governs punishment, and its changes have three forms. When these three lose their proper measure, there will be treacherous ministers and murderous subjects, with corpses and bloodshed in war.\n\nThe Crooked Arrow star’s omen: Nothing is straighter than an arrow, yet one who wields a crooked arrow is a wicked person. Formerly, when Xiang Yu rescued Julu, a crooked arrow flowed westward. He then buried the Qin soldiers alive and massacred Xianyang, using chaos to punish chaos.\n\nThe omen of stars gathering as portents: When water, wood, and fire combine in the Eastern Well, the prognostication says there will be external warfare and mourning. When the five planets enter the Ghost Cart, or when wood, fire, and metal combine, appearing like linked pearls in the Void, it signifies death and mourning. When three stars gather in the Dipper, generals and ministers will be executed. When fire, metal, and water combine in the *miao* asterism, or when metal and water combine in the Eastern Well, it signifies a gathering of white-clad mourners. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, the Son of Heaven wore white four times and visited the imperial residences—this was the omen. During the Tianbao era of Tang, the five planets gathered in the Winnowing Basket and Tail. The prognostication said: \"With virtue, there is celebration; without virtue, calamity.\" In the Zhide era, wood, fire, metal, and water gathered in the Quail’s Head, following Jupiter. Wood and fire, as yang, govern the central states; metal and water, as yin, govern the outer states. When yin and yang combine, the inner and outer states will be linked by warfare. From this, we see that the gathering of the five planets may be auspicious or inauspicious; one cannot be rigid.\n\nThe omen of meteors: During the Yuanyan era of Han, at the hour of *ru*, a meteor appeared with a head as large as a jar, over ten *zhang* long, red and white, descending from the sun toward the southeast. Some were as large as basins, others like chicken eggs, shining brightly like rain, falling until dusk. The prognostication was that the Son of Heaven would lose power, and later Wang Mang usurped the state. During the Jianwu era, over a hundred small meteors appeared, some moving from southwest to northeast in all directions. The prognostication was that the common people would flee, and later the rebellion of Gongsun Shu caused the people to scatter. A meteor as large as a cup moved westward from the Weaving Maiden; later, Empress Guanglie passed away. A meteor emerged from the Literary Prosperity asterism, its white light illuminating the earth for four *zhang*, swaying like a dragon or serpent. Soon after, Wang Shang took his own life.\n\nThe *Jin Treatise* says: It is the messenger of Heaven. Large stars are messengers of great matters; small stars, of minor matters. Those descending from above are called \"flowing\"; those ascending from below are called \"flying.\" Large ones are called \"rushing,\" which are also meteors. A rumbling sound is a sign of anger. Small meteors represent the common people. Those as large as the moon represent the ruler. When all stars shake, it is a sign of the people’s toil.\n\nThe Whispering Ear star’s omen: Beside the great star of the Western Net, a small star stirs and moves, indicating slanderous disorder at the ruler’s side.\n\nThe Celestial Slander star’s omen: It is also said that the six stars of the Curled Tongue in the north govern speech and discern flattery and slander. The star above the Curled Tongue is called the Celestial Slander.\n\nThe Ominous Spear and Withered Comet’s omen: Four stars of unusual form bring calamity—one state will be broken, and its ruler endangered. The remaining calamities will be drought, famine, and violent epidemics.\n\nMars’s essence as an omen: At the end of the Daye era of Sui, Mars moved retrograde into the Southern Dipper, its color red like blood, its rays flashing and shining seven or eight *chi* long. Later, Yang Xuangan rebelled, and the world fell into great chaos. During the Changshou era of Tang, Mars trespassed against the Five Feudal Lords. Hun Yi, the director of the armillary sphere, memorialized: \"My fate is in metal, and the Five Feudal Lords’ position is in fire. Fire overcomes metal; I will die.\" Empress Wu said: \"Let us perform exorcisms.\" She transferred him to the post of Director of the Waterways Bureau, where water generates metal, and also removed him from the position of Grand Astrologer. \"You need not worry.\" That autumn, Hun Yi died.\n\nVenus’s essence as an omen: The Six Bandit stars are the essence of Venus. They appear in the due south, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and red, shaped like a comet with nine rays. The Heavenly Dog is also Venus, governing warfare. The Amnesty star: A star over three *zhang* long appears south of the Dipper’s handle, extending to the Xuanyuan asterism before vanishing. The prognostication is that there will be an amnesty.\n\nSaturn’s essence as an omen: The Xianhan star is Saturn’s essence. It appears in the due north, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and red with a blue center, or blue with a red center. Below its tail, three comets lie horizontally; it is also called the Five Remnants. A star appearing in the due east, resembling the celestial timekeeper, about six *zhang* above the earth, large and yellow.\n\nThe Wolf’s Horn omen: East of the Nine Wandering stars is a great star called the Wolf. When its color changes, there will be many bandits. The Coiled Rope: It is the prison of the lowly. It is also called the Linked Rope. Linked to the Celestial Prison, it governs the suppression of violence. When all nine stars are bright, prisons will be crowded. When seven stars are bright, there will be a great amnesty. The Axe and Drill are in use. The Returning Evil omen: It is like a star but not a star, like a cloud but not a cloud. When the Returning Serpent appears, there will be one who returns to their state.",
      "overlap_context": "embles a dog. Its base is round, like a field of several *qing*. Its top is sharp, and within a thousand *li*, armies are broken and generals slain.\nMeng said: It is also the essence of Venus.\n\nVenus’s passage across the sky has variations of excess and deficiency. Excess and deficiency mean: when the sun is in the south, Venus is in the south; when the sun is in the north, Venus is in the north. When in excess, feudal lords are unsettled; in warfare, advance is auspicious, retreat inauspicious.",

      "translated_text": "Its omens may also be auspicious or inauspicious. The above is all recorded in the *Treatise on Astronomy*. Celestial changes correspond to the rise and fall of the times. Though stars are one in kind, their forms and colors, their constancy and mutations, their seasons and divisions—each has its own significance and interpretation. Their omens differ, yet only Yan Ziling was worthy of the omen of the visiting star, and only Chen Zhonggong could match the gathering of virtue-stars. Fu Yue was born when the asterism *Jiwei* hosted a guest star, and Zhuge Liang died when a star fell into the central encampment. Noble persons and gentlemen have never been unconnected to celestial phenomena.\n\nVisiting stars may also undergo transformations: when their form is as large as a melon and their color is greenish-white, they portend either great floods or severe famine. When a white *qi* arises in the southwest of *Tianyuan*, cattle and horses will perish or be injured—how inauspicious indeed! During the Spring and Autumn period, comets appeared three times. At night, the constant stars would vanish, and stars would fall like rain in the darkness. Thirty-six rulers were slain, twenty-five states perished, and lords fled in such numbers that they could not preserve their altars of soil and grain.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"When stars appear at night without clouds yet heaven weeps, what is the cause?\" It is because heaven cannot bear the inversion of the noble and the base, and grieves that the common people suffer such calamities. How could celestial signs be empty correspondences?\n\nThus, the recluses of ancient times who concealed their virtue would observe the heavens by night and examine human affairs by day, harboring hidden concerns. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The Way of Heaven diminishes the full and augments the modest; the Way of Earth alters the full and flows to the modest; ghosts and spirits harm the full and bless the modest; the Way of Man detests the full and favors the modest.\" Ouyang Zi said: \"This is the sage’s ultimate discourse on the relationship between heaven and man.\"\n\nThough the *Spring and Autumn Annals* records solar eclipses and celestial changes, Confucius never explained their causes, saying: \"The minds of heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits cannot be known; what can be known is only man.\" When the sun reaches its zenith, the bell tolls in reverse; prosperity and decline alternate. Heaven—I do not know it; I see only its waxing and waning in things. When plants and trees reach maturity, they wither and fall; when things are lowly, they advance and flow onward. Earth—I do not know it; I see only its transformations and flows in things. Those among men who are arrogant and excessive meet with misfortune, while those who are restrained and frugal enjoy good fortune. Ghosts and spirits—I do not know them; I see only the fortunes and misfortunes of men.\n\nSince the minds of heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits cannot be known, we infer them from their manifestations in things. Thus, we base our words on what is visible in their movements: we speak of waxing and waning, of transformation and flow, of fortune and misfortune. But for man, what can be known is straightforward—we speak directly of likes and dislikes. The known and the unknown are expressed in different terms, yet when weighed together, they differ not from man. Because they are unknowable, we should revere and keep them at a distance. Because they differ not from man, we need only cultivate our human affairs. Never has a man’s heart been content yet heaven’s intent angered; never has human principle been perverse yet the Way of Heaven been compliant.\n\nAlas! After the sages passed, heterodoxies arose. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, scholars have long been deluded by theories of calamities and anomalies. The doctrines of celestial patterns and the Five Phases have proliferated endlessly. My confusion cannot but differ from that of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Ouyang [Xiu] held that what is knowable in man is one, while the unknowable in heaven, earth, and ghosts and spirits are three. When the one is exhausted, the three are contained within. How, then, should the noble person conduct themselves? Only by cultivating the self and awaiting destiny.\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Eight, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Lesser Yin**\n\nIn the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, Duke of Jin asked Bo Xia: \"What is meant by *chén*?\" He replied: \"*Chén* is the conjunction of the sun and moon. *Chén* is time.\" I humbly observe: From the eleventh month to the tenth month, from *zǐ* to *hài*, the sun and moon converge at fixed times, hence the term *chén*. In the heavens, this manifests as the twenty-eight constellations, visible to the eye, thus described in terms of stars. Yet their circulation through the four seasons and eight nodes is formless *qi*, dispersed across the great void—seemingly tangible yet intangible—all governed by *chén*.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Chén* are the stars in the sky, divided into twelve segments, which are the twelve *chén*, the celestial firmament. The sun, moon, and stars are four distinct entities. Here, *chén* refers to the degrees within each segment. For instance, when the sun and moon lodge in *Jiǎo* at a certain degree, that lodging place is *chén*. Thus it is said: 'The conjunction of the sun and moon is called *chén*.'\"\n\nMaster Wei of the Xiang clan said: \"If referring to the stellar bodies themselves, they are called *stars*. When the sun and moon meet at a star, it is named *constellation*, *chén*, *station*, *mansion*, or *conjunction*. If not based on their meeting with a constellation, then referring to the stellar bodies themselves, they are simply *stars*.\"\n\nThe *Essential Meaning of the Book of Documents* states: \"The celestial pole is called the Northern *Chén*; the five planets include the *Chén* star; there are also the twelve stations and the solar *chén*.\" It further says: \"*Chén* number twelve; the conjunction of the sun and moon is called *chén*. *Chén* is the body of Heaven, the *qi* of no-thing.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"*Chén* are the twelve counted from Earth. The *qi* of no-thing is invisible, yet it becomes manifest through the conjunction of the sun and moon. Because it is invisible, it is *yin*; the *yin* of Heaven is Heaven’s body, the foundation of Heaven’s existence. Counted from Earth, it is Heaven’s Earth.\"\n\nIt also says: \"The *yin* within *yin* is *chén*, the celestial firmament. *Qi* is one, yet its ruler is *qián*. *Chén* is the *qi* of no-thing, the body of Heaven. Thus it is called the celestial firmament, for *chén* is to Heaven as soil is to Earth. *Chén* is the body of Heaven; soil is the body of Earth. *Chén* is the *qi* of no-thing, invisible. Yet by observing the stars, we know its vast emptiness can contain all things. Soil is a tangible substance, visible. By observing mountains, we further know its capacity to bear all things. Soil is the great substance; *chén* is the great void. The sun, moon, and stars are lodged within it. Though *chén* is invisible, Heaven is ever visible day and night, hence the one that is not used is the one that is revered.\"\n\nIt further says: \"*Chén* reaching the sun is generation; the sun reaching *chén* is function. Following is generation, while reversing is function. *Chén* reaching the sun refers to Heaven’s leftward movement, which is harmonious, distributing *qi* to generate things. The sun reaching *chén* refers to the sun’s rightward movement, which is contrary, transforming *qi* to serve the seasons. Thus the seasons can be retroactively deduced, and things naturally come to fruition.\"\n\nMaster Zi Yun said: \"Patrolling the six *jiǎ*, encountering the Dipper—this speaks of the correspondence between Heaven and the sun.\" It also says: \"Stars are the surplus essence of the sun; *chén* are the surplus *qi* of the moon. The sun is the essence of *yang*, the spirit-soul of Heaven. The moon is the essence of *yin*, the *qi*-po of Heaven. Stars are the surplus essence of *yang*; *chén* are the surplus *qi* of *yin*. Thus stars are the spirits of Heaven, while *chén* are the body of Heaven. The sun and moon in the sky are like a person’s true heart and life-gate, the root of *yin* and *yang*. The five planets are like the five viscera; the myriad stars are like the limbs, bones, essence, and blood. *Chén* to Heaven is as the body and *po* are to humans.\"\n\nIt further says: \"Heaven has the sun, moon, stars, and *chén*, making five. Earth has the five phases—metal, wood, water, and fire—making five. *Chén*, the *yin* within *yang*, cannot change; thus a day has twelve *chén*, which are invisible. *Chén* is the body of Heaven. *Chén* to Heaven is as soil is to Earth. Heaven governs function—does it have spirit? *Chén* cannot exhaust Heaven, unlike soil, which exhausts Earth. Beyond *chén* is another name for Heaven; soil is what constitutes Earth.\"\n\nMaster Hanshang said: \"The moon is born from the sun’s illumination; the multitude of stars are bathed in its radiance, their light transformed by water. The Three Luminaries share the same form, *yin* and *yang* paired, their body being *chén*.\" It also says: \"Heaven transforms one into four. The four have form, while the one is formless.\"\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"The sun, moon, and stars constitute Heaven’s body. The four completed form the body of the Great Ultimate, which retreats and hides among the four yet remains invisible. Thus the sun, moon, stars, and Heaven make five; without the sun, moon, and stars, there is no Heaven. The four have form, thus constituting shape. The one is formless, retreating into concealment. Speaking of five, it must return to Heaven; speaking of ten, it must return to Earth. Five corresponds to the Ultimate of Non-Being; ten corresponds to the Ultimate of Being. It may also be said: remove the one, and the four cease to exist.\"\n\nHeaven’s body numbers four, with one unused. The invisibility of Heaven’s *chén* arises because *chén* is Heaven’s body, hence unseen. Its color is deep blue; its form is vast and undifferentiated. Among the four, only the sun, moon, and stars are distinctly visible. Thus we know that among the five, one is retained as the body, hence four are used. Among the four, one is retained as the body, hence three are used. In this way, five becomes the formless one, exemplifying spontaneity. *Chén* is the unused one, exemplifying the Dao.\"\n\nThe *Great Mystery* uses one *yuan* to govern three directions, called Heaven, Earth, and Human—this conveys the same idea. One season consists of three months; one month consists of thirty days, both excluding the *chén* count.

      "translated_text": "Dividing thus, seven are employed. This is why celestial *chén* are unseen, and earthly waters remain ever concealed. Master Zhu said: \"The void where no stars appear is called *chén*.\" I humbly observe: The *Book of Changes* speaks of five celestial numbers, while Master Shao speaks of four celestial images. From whence do these four arise? Fundamentally, from one yin and one yang. One yang divides into two, yielding the images of Greater Yang and Lesser Yang—these are the sun and stars. One yin divides into two, yielding the images of Greater Yin and Lesser Yin—these are the moon and *chén*. Sun, moon, stars, and *chén* together form the four celestial images, none of which may be lacking. Yet Master Shao calls *chén* the celestial body, while Master Zhu says *chén* is the starless void that does not move. If so, then one *chén* serves two functions: as Lesser Yin and as the celestial body. Is this permissible? The answer is no. The celestial numbers originally comprise five, one being the Ultimate Non-Polar, and four □ forming the four images. Within these four images, one is embodied while three are employed. Lesser Yin becomes the body, upon which the sun, moon, and stars depend. As for the claim that *chén* is the starless void: *chén* is originally undifferentiated and unfathomable, the ultimate of embodiment. The sages designated the places where the sun and moon conjoin as *chén*. Thus, within the formless, no image is unencompassed. Its immobility, residing in the north as the pivot of the Pole Star, is called the Northern *Chén*. Therefore, while Lesser Yin is *chén* and constitutes the celestial body, the Northern *Chén* resides at the center of the celestial body and presides over the twelve *chén*. Hence, *chén* are used to distinguish directions, called the twelve stations; *chén* encompass stars and lands, called the twelve fields; *chén* encompass the twelve branches, twelve years, and twelve months—all are *chén*. Throughout the cosmos, vast or minute, high or low, none is not enclosed within them. For details, see the following section.\n\n**Celestial Pivot**\nIn the north there is *chén*, serving as the hub and pivot. Abiding at the center, unmoving, it revolves the Dipper’s handle externally to establish the four seasons and align the seven governances. The *Western Record* states: \"Among the central palace’s stars of the celestial pole, the brightest one is the constant abode of the Great One.\" I say: The One is the beginning of qi and numbers, without material form. That it \"constantly abides\" signifies the principle of residing at the center, unmoving. The *Eastern Record* states: \"The Northern *Chén* Star unites primordial radiance, erecting the imperial form, operating the mechanism, conferring measures, and unfurling the hundred spirits. The three steps and nine ranks, the Dipper’s balance and the Supreme Subtlety, the *shetis* and their kind—one hundred twenty constellations—along with the twenty-eight lodges, each arrayed in their places, correspond below to the twelve branches. Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the images of the stars and constellations are complete.\" I say: The nine words—unite, suspend, erect, operate, confer, unfurl, belong, array, and correspond—are most worthy of contemplation. They signify that the *chén*-pole encompasses all images of Heaven, Earth, stars, and constellations within it, hence it is said to be complete. When condensed, it is primordial qi; when dispersed, it becomes stellar radiance; when unfurled, it is the hundred spirits; when erected, it is the Dipper’s balance. Ban Gu called it *sheti*. Directly aligned with the Dipper’s handle, it establishes the seasonal nodes, hence it is also called the Celestial Pivot. The twenty-eight lodges are arrayed within the twelve *chén*, and the twelve *chén* are governed by the Northern *Chén*. Thus it is said: \"Abiding in its place, all stars share it.\" The *Er Ya* commentary states: \"The Dipper’s handle establishes the *chén* to rectify the four seasons, hence it is called *chén*. The Northern *Chén* encompasses the twelve *chén* within it. The Dipper’s handle points to the twelve *chén*.\" Many classics speak of the Northern Dipper but not the Northern *Chén*, for *chén* resides at the center, wu-wei, concealed within function. Thus, there is no visible marker to point to. What can be pointed to and spoken of is merely the Dipper’s handle as it establishes the *chén*. When the Northern Dipper is mentioned, the Northern *Chén* is thereby understood. Master Cheng said: \"The Northern *Chén* is inherently unmoving and serves as the master of qi and the most venerable of stars. Therefore, all stars encircle and orient toward it from all sides.\" I have examined and weighed the discourses of former masters and arrived at this understanding: The Northern *Chén*, unmoving, is the pivot of Heaven. Master Zhu said: \"The ancients took this as the pole and could not do without a marker. Thus, they selected a small star nearby and called it the Pole Star.\" Someone asked: \"Does the Pole Star move?\" He replied: \"It does move, but as it is near the *chén*, though it moves, the motion is imperceptible. Now, if one observes the Pole Star through a tube, one sees it move, but it remains within the tube, never moving beyond. Formerly, people said the Northern Pole was unmoving. By the Song dynasty, people had determined that the Northern Pole was merely near the *chén*, while the Pole Star still moved.\" Former accounts all took the \"silken star\" as the celestial pole, residing due north as the unmoving heart of Heaven. Now, upon verification, the celestial pole also revolves day and night. The immovable point lies within one and a half degrees of the Pole Star. Thus, in an armillary sphere, the central axle is fixed, unmoving, to represent the heart of Heaven. I observe: The five stars of the Northern Pole reside within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. The northernmost star lies at the celestial heart. Ninety-one degrees separate it from each of the four directions. Ninety-one degrees of Heaven total three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter degrees. The four directions converge like spokes, and the *chén*-star resides at the center—within the northernmost star, where there is no star. All stars share it: the Northern *Chén* is to Heaven as the heart is to the human body—the master of the entire form. Hands, feet, ears, eyes, blood, vessels, skin, and flesh—none is unrelated. The world is nothing but people, yet the lord faces south to serve as their master. The celestial body is nothing but *chén*, yet the Northern *Chén* resides at the center to serve as its master. Even the degrees of the celestial sphere and the myriad beings in their multitude—none is not interconnected through it.",
      "overlap_context": " one *yuan* to govern three directions, called Heaven, Earth, and Human—this conveys the same idea. One season consists of three months; one month consists of thirty days, both excluding the *chén* count. A season originally has four months but uses only three; a month originally has forty days but uses only thirty. Both exclude one *chén*, using three while leaving one unused. Heaven has three *chén*; Heaven is three, Earth is four. Heaven encompasses Earth’s surplus; Earth has the four phases.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the unmoving *chén* serves as the root of all movement. Hence it is said: the formless governs the formed. This \"unused one\" is the ultimate of the limitless, descending to reside within us. Ah! How profound!\n\nMaster Zhu said: The North Pole is the pivot of Heaven, for it dwells at the center—hence it is called the North Pole. The South Pole lies at the center beneath the earth, directly opposite the North Pole. Though Heaven revolves, Earth remains unmoving at the center. Heaven’s form turns like a potter’s wheel, with the Pole as a crossbar fixed within it, its two ends firmly set. One end lies above the north—this is the North Pole. The other lies above the south—this is the South Pole.\n\nThe Great One, like an imperial throne within the Purple Tenuity, bears the title of Northern *Chén*. At its very center, in the starless void, lies the slightest point of stillness, which observers take as the Pole. Like the hub of a wheel, the navel of a millstone, Heaven circles Earth in ceaseless leftward rotation. Only this, its pivot, remains unmoving—fixed at the two ends of south and north. The South Pole dips thirty-six degrees below the earth, so that within its seventy-two-degree circuit, it is perpetually hidden from view. The *Old Tang History* records: travelers at sea once saw several bright stars beneath the South Pole, all within its seventy-two-degree span. The North Pole rises thirty-six degrees above the earth, so that within its seventy-two-degree circuit, it is perpetually visible. The star of the North Pole lies precisely within this ever-visible seventy-two-degree span, steadfast in its place, unmoving. Around it, the circumpolar stars revolve leftward with the turning sky. The sun and moon, as weft threads, move rightward in alternation, appearing and vanishing as if circling back toward it.\n\nMonk Yixing of the Tang observed: the distance between north and south spans over eighty thousand *li*. In the kingdom of Linyi to the south, the North Pole stands seventeen degrees high; at the Protectorate of Annan, it stands twenty-one degrees high. Other regions differ. The *Great History of the South* records... and others who reached the sea, gazing southward beneath the Old Man Star, saw a dazzling array of stars—none of which bore names in ancient texts. Someone asked: \"When the South Pole appears, the Old Man Star brings longevity—is this the South Pole?\" Master Zhu’s reply explains: the South Pole is not visible; rather, there is a distinct Old Man Star in the south. When the South Pole rises high, the Old Man Star emerges into view.\n\nThe Great One is the imperial seat, like a sovereign enthroned at the North Pole. Like an imperial capital within the Purple Tenuity, it lies within the seventy-two-degree span that is ever visible and never hidden—hence its title of Northern *Chén*. The *Former Records* state: of the stars at the celestial pole, the brightest is where the Great One eternally resides. The Great One, Heavenly August, Great Emperor of the North *Chén*—by these names it establishes the celestial measures, and it is also the Purple Tenuity Palace. The Celestial Emperor dwells at the center; \"purple\" signifies this central palace. Within this palace, the divine diagrams and the opening and closing of yin and yang all reside.\n\nMaster Zhu said: this *chén* remains ever in its place. Heaven’s form revolves day and night without cease, and this serves as its pivot. Like the hub of a wheel or the navel of a millstone, though it may seem to move, it cannot—it is not that it wills itself to be unmoving. Zhu Hanshang said: the *chén* is Heaven’s pivot, yet the unmoving point lies beyond it. Beneath the Pole Star, the sages spoke of it as the North *Chén*. Astronomers, however, refer to the point beneath the Pole Star—this is but a difference in precision.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why is the North *Chén* called Heaven’s pivot?\" The answer: Heaven is round and moves, enveloping Earth. Earth is square and still, resting at Heaven’s center. Thus, Heaven’s form half covers the earth above and half encircles it below, revolving leftward without end. Only this point remains unmoving—hence it is called the pivot. All other stars, along with the twenty-eight lunar lodges, share the same motion.\n\nMaster Zhu replied: consider the Supreme Subtlety in Wings, the Celestial Market in Tail, or the Dragging Stars in Neck—their southern distance from the celestial equator is slight, while their northern distance from the celestial pole is vast. Thus, they cannot remain unmoving but must revolve with the circumpolar stars. Their movements—east or west, hidden or visible—follow fixed degrees. Gazing upward, one sees not a moment’s pause. Yet those within the Purple Tenuity remain in their places, unmoving.\n\nIf this were so, then one Heaven would have four pivots, one wheel four hubs, one millstone four navels. The slightest shift in position would shatter it like broken spokes or shattered tiles—such a day would come swiftly. How then could motion endure without end?\n\nHu Wufeng remarked: there are said to be three unmoving Pole Stars—this is quite incomprehensible. If Heaven’s motion is like a turning millstone, then the Pole Star is merely the central stem, which does not move. If there were three unmoving stars, it could not turn.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan asked: \"The Pole Star lies at Heaven’s center, and all directions—east, west, south, north—are aligned by it. Yet why does the Pole Star always lie above them?\" Master Zhu had no answer at first. Later, he reflected: it is merely that one faces away from the Pole Star. If the Pole Star is north, then south has no fixed position.\n\nThe *Gongyang Commentary* states: the North *Chén* is the Great *Chén*, ever abiding in its place. Those who are lost, not knowing east from west, look to it. Yongjia’s Master Zheng said: the North Pole resides at Heaven’s center yet always lies to the north of people, for Heaven’s form inclines northward. Some say: the Dipper’s handle can point to the cardinal directions, but the *chén* serves no such purpose for the sun’s observation. Yet by its position, one knows where the *chén* lies.\n\nThe *Book of Documents* commentary says: the sun and moon are Heaven’s messengers; the stars and constellations are Heaven’s markers. One moves left, the other right, weaving the warp and weft. From the Dipper’s handle’s direction, it is called *jian*.",

      "translated_text": "From where the sun and moon conjoin, it is called *chén*. As the Dipper’s handle shifts left and the sun and moon drift right, the *chén* and *jiàn* thus invariably align. When the moon’s motion reaches the sun, their conjunction forms the *chén*. The *chén* itself has no fixed form but is revealed through the stars—hence the celestial standard’s auspiciousness. When the *chén* lies in *Xingji*, moving from north to west, the earthly standard aligns with Heaven, and the *Xuangan* corrects it at *Shiwei*. The western quadrant’s *Jianglou*, *Daliang*, and *Shishen*, the southern quadrant’s *Chunshou*, *Chunhuo*, and *Chunwei*, and the eastern quadrant’s *Shouxing*, *Dahuo*, and *Ximu*—their new moons may thus be known.\n\nThe *Chunqiu Wai Zhuan* states: \"When the sun and moon lodge in the Celestial Temple,\" it refers to the month of *jiàn-yín*. When the *chén* is in *Kezī*, it is the month of *jiàn-hài*. When the *chén* is in the *Tianhan*, the sun and moon conjoin at *Longtang*. Thus, by the new moon’s position, one knows the *chén*; by the *chén*’s conjunction, one knows the Dipper’s *jiàn*.\n\nIn my humble opinion: the Dipper’s handle and the North *Chén* are interconnected. The North *Chén* governs the twelve *chén*, while the Dipper’s handle points to them. Moreover, the *Gongyang Commentary* states: *Dahuo* is the Great *Chén*—here, *Jiazhong* arises from the *qi* of *Fang* and *Xin*, serving as the Celestial Emperor’s Bright Hall, also called the Celestial Palace. This is not comparable to the North *Chén*’s Great *Chén*. For instance, in the first month of *jiàn-yín*, the *chén* lies in the northeast, while the sun and moon conjoin in the northwest at *hài*—their *qi* harmonize because *yín* and *hài* align. The sun and moon always follow this pattern.\n\nThe Dipper’s monthly pointer is called *jiàn-dǒu*. Its first star is the *Kui*, the fourth the *Heng*, and the seventh the *Biao*. The *jiàn* at dusk is determined by the *Biao*, which belongs to *yin*; at midnight, the *jiàn* is determined by the *Heng*, which stands at the center of the three *jiàn*; the *Kui* belongs to *yang*. Calendar scholars use the sequence of *jiàn*, *chú*, *mǎn*, *píng*, *dìng*, *zhí*, *pò*, *wēi*, *chéng*, *shōu*, *kāi*, and *bì*—twelve days in total—repeating in cycles, observing their correspondences to determine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. With each month’s transition, the solar terms alternate, and two values align with the day. For example, in the first month, the *yín* day corresponds to *jiàn*, the *mǎo* day to the second, and the *chén* day to the third, aligning with the Dipper’s pointer.\n\nThe *Yi Zhuan* states: \"The number of the Great Expansion is fifty; its use is forty-nine.

      "translated_text": "Someone objects: \"If so, then the Supreme Ultimate has this North Star to which it may be pointed. Yet Master Zhou [Dunyi] speaks of the Ultimateless (*wuji*) and yet the Supreme Ultimate—this seems not to be the case.\"\n\nI respond: The Supreme Ultimate is without sound or scent, the most subtle within which resides the most manifest principle. The North Star is the most central and ultimate, within its visible form lies the most subtle principle. Substance and function share a single origin; the manifest and the subtle are without separation. Thus the North Star, abiding at the center unmoving, can generate the Two Modes, the sun and moon, the four seasons, the Five Phases, the twelve months, and the twenty-four *qi*. The Supreme Ultimate, in its utmost quiescence, moves and can generate the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams—each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate.\n\nThe North Star of Heaven subtly possesses form, resembling the Supreme Ultimate of the Master [Confucius]. The Supreme Ultimate of the Master is thus formless yet possesses form. The North Star of Heaven is the progenitor of *qi*, yet principle courses within it. The Supreme Ultimate is the progenitor of principle, yet *qi* courses within it. These may be of a single Dao.\n\nMaster Shao [Yong] said: \"Heaven swirls indistinct above, beyond measure—thus we observe the Dipper’s numbers to divine the heavens. The Dipper’s establishment is Heaven’s movement. The *kui* establishes *zǐ*, the handle establishes *yín*; the stars take *yín* as day.\" The Dipper has seven stars, so day and night are divided into no more than seven parts.\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"That the stars take *yín* as day is central. The stars take *yín* as dawn and *xū* as dusk. The sun takes *mǎo* and *yǒu* as midpoints, thus twelve divisions using seven. The stars take *yín* and *xū* as limits, thus ten divisions using seven.\"\n\nI elaborate: The Way of Heaven revolves leftward, taking the celestial stems as its body. The *qi* of no-thing is not visible—within its indistinctness, only the stars may be pointed to. The sun, moon, and five planets move rightward from the earth. The Dipper’s handle establishes the four seasons in balance.\n\nThe number of the Great Expansion is fifty; one is the Supreme Ultimate. Forty-nine is seven times seven, divided and used, each entering its proper place. One is the body of Heaven, one is the Seven Governors, one resides at the center—this is the Northern Dipper. Four arrayed in the four directions—these are the seven lodges. Thus Heaven and Earth, the four directions, take the Dipper as their pivot. Heaven’s movement through the four seasons begins from the Dipper and points forth. When the Dipper is correct, the seasons are correct; when the seasons are correct, the Dipper is correct. Thus calendars have methods of adjustment, but the Dipper has no deviation in its degrees. Those who skillfully regulate the calendar verify it against the Dipper alone.\n\nThe Northern Dipper’s seven stars lie within the Supreme Subtlety. The four stars of the *kui* form the *zōngjī*, the three stars of the handle form the Jade Balance. The Dipper is the symbol of the ruler, the master of decrees. The Assistant Star aids *Kāiyáng*, assisting the Dipper’s success—it is the symbol of the prime minister.\n\nFrom one to four is the *kui*; from five to seven is the handle. The first is Celestial Pivot; the second, *Zōng*; the third, *Jī*; the fourth, *Quán*; the fifth, Jade Balance; the sixth, *Kāiyáng*; the seventh, *Yáoguāng*.\n\nThe Pivot is Heaven, symbol of the Son of Heaven, the power of yang. *Zōng* is Earth, symbol of the female ruler, the punishment of yin. *Jī* is Man, the Decree Star, governing fire. *Quán* is Time, the Punitive Star, governing water. The Jade Balance is Sound, the Killing Star, governing earth. *Kāiyáng* is the Pitchpipe, the Perilous Star, governing wood and the Celestial Granary of the Five Grains. *Yáoguāng* is the Star, also called the Responsive Star, governing metal.\n\nThe Assistant Star, one in number, aids *Kāiyáng*, assisting the Dipper’s success and governing the correction of peril and the rectification of imbalance.\n\nSomeone asks: \"The Dipper has seven stars, and with the Assistant Star, eight. Yet astrologers speak of the Dipper having nine stars, governing the Nine Provinces—why is this?\" Another says: \"The *Treatise on Celestial Offices* mentions *Mèngkè* and *Shètí*. *Shètí* is a star’s name, following the Dipper’s handle to establish the twelve months. If this star is included to make nine, is this acceptable?\"\n\nI reply: There is no clear evidence for this; it cannot be followed. Master Zhang Heng, profound in his knowledge of Heaven, stated that the Northern Dipper and the four palace stars together make five sevens—thus the seven stars are the Dipper, and this cannot be increased.\n\nThe learning of blind musicians and historians in the *Yi* has degenerated into absurdity.",

      "translated_text": "Scholars may well suspend judgment where doubt remains. Master Ouyang said: \"The relationship between Heaven and humanity is distant indeed. To have a practitioner of a single art deploy calculations and accumulated fractions, abandoning the classics to follow the historians in seeking concordance—is this not arduous?\"\n\nThe *Treatise on Celestial Offices* states: \"The so-called *xuanji* and jade balance align the Seven Governors. The handle connects to *Dragon’s Horn*, the balance rests upon *Southern Dipper*, and the *Fish-trap* leans upon *Triaster’s* head.\" The *Former Records* say: \"The handle is used for dusk alignment, the handle extending from *Huá* to the southwest. The balance is used for midnight alignment, the balance centered between the *Yellow River* and *Jǐ* in the Central States. The *Fish-trap* is used for dawn alignment, the *Fish-trap* in the lands east of the *Sea* and *Dài*. *Dān* means ‘to connect.’ *Dragon’s Horn* is *Celestial Fields*. The seven eastern lodges together form the shape of a dragon. *Yīn* means ‘center.’ The jade balance resides in the middle, with the northern and southern dippers aligned. The seventh star of the Dipper’s handle is the *Tail*, which belongs to *yin*. At dusk, *yin* occupies its position, thus governing the southwest. The balance star resides in the center; at dusk, the handle aligns with *yín*, and at midnight, the balance also aligns with *yín*. The first star of the *Fish-trap* belongs to *yang*, thus governing the northeast. This is why the Dipper’s handle connects to the star *Dragon’s Horn* in the east.\"\n\nThe *Essential Principles* states: \"What the Dipper aligns with are the earthly branches. Where the branches converge are the celestial stations. The Dipper and the branches unite.\" Note: The Dipper’s handle aligns with the twelve earthly branches, while the sun’s body moves through the twelve months, revolving rightward in conjunction with the lunar lodges. However, what the Dipper aligns with are the twelve earthly branches on earth, hence the terms *zǐ*, *chǒu*, and so forth. The branches are the conjunctions of the sun and moon, which occur in the twelve celestial stations, hence the terms *Kuízī*, *Jiànglóu*, and so forth. The twelve pitch-pipes serve as tubes for awaiting *qi*. The *yin* and *yang* of sound each have their correspondences, as with *Huángzhōng* aligning with the eleventh month, *jiànzǐ*, and *Dàlǚ* with the twelfth month, *jiànchǒu*, and so on. Thus, the Dipper and the branches unite with the lodges to complete the conjunctions of the sun and moon. The Dipper’s stars also revolve with the turning of Heaven.\"\n\nMaster Kong said: \"The Dipper’s stars, in one day and night, also revolve with Heaven, completing one circuit and moving one degree across the sky.\" The sage-kings observed the Dipper’s alignment to command the four seasons and divide the twelve monthly conjunctions. The *Book of Songs* says: \"In the north there is the Dipper, its western handle raised.\" Master Zhu said: \"The Northern Dipper is ever visible, never concealed. The Southern Dipper’s handle invariably points west. If the Northern Dipper’s handle points west, it is also autumn.\" Master Dong said: \"The Dipper has four stars forming its bowl, and three stars forming its handle, which hangs down and is raised. The Dipper revolves with the turning of Heaven, and in each of the four seasons, it has its own demarcated region. Thus, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: ‘The Dipper has its encircling domain.’\"\n\nMaster Li Zijian said: \"The Northern Dipper is Heaven’s tongue and throat, measuring and harmonizing the primordial *qi* to regulate the four seasons.\" The *Great Mystery* also says: \"The *yin* substance is the Northern Dipper; at night, it measures *yin*. It speaks of the *yin* night substance being rectified by the Northern Dipper, which calendars the sun and moon to determine the seasons and complete the year.\" Moreover, the North Pole and South Pole stand opposite each other as the *Pivot Stars*. The South Pole is concealed while the North Pole is visible, and people often speak of the visible one because it resides at the center of Heaven. The Northern Dipper has seven stars, an odd number, while the Southern Dipper has six stars, an even number—thus does Heaven display such artistry.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"When the branch is at the Dipper’s handle, the sun and moon conjoin at the Southern Dipper.\" Its stars are also divided into north and south: the two southern stars are called *Great Bridge*, the two central stars *Celestial Minister*, and the two northern stars *Celestial Court*.

According to Shao Kangjie’s numerology, the daily, yearly, and epochal cycles all employ twelve: thus, one day has twelve hours, one year twelve months, one epoch twelve generations, and one great era twelve conjunctions. This encompasses past and present without exception. From one hour, one may infer a day; from one day, a month; from one month, a year; and from one year, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years. Extending this upward, how could it be limited merely to the twelve months of a year?\n\nThe twelve sovereign hexagrams outline the general principles, while the *Supreme Principles of the Sublime World* (*Huangji jingshi*) exhausts their ultimate depths. The *Sublime World Through the Ages* is a work of calendrical computation, using the twelve sovereign hexagrams to govern the twelve conjunctions, thereby fixing the seasonal nodes. Within this framework, one deduces the waxing and waning of fortune, simply by doubling the calculations. The hexagram qi of Jing Fang employs six days and seven fen, and Shao Kangjie likewise uses six days and seven fen. Kangjie’s and Jing Fang’s *Changes* are one and the same work, unrelated to the *Book of Changes*.\n\nMaster Zheng said: \"The movements of the sun and moon form twelve conjunctions in a year. The sage-kings followed these conjunctions to establish the great reckoning, observing their meetings to designate the four seasons.\" The hexagram qi system outlines its essentials, the *Great Mystery* (*Taixuan*) refines its details, and the *Sublime World* elaborates its wonders. Thereafter, the workings of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and epochs, and the rise and fall of emperors and kings may all be deduced.\n\nIn years, it is reckoned by waxing and waning; in months, by leaps and bounds; in days, by division into day and night.\n\nThe Grand Historian said: \"The great cycle undergoes a minor change every thirty years, a medium change every hundred years, and a major change every five hundred years. Three major changes make one epoch, and three epochs complete the great reckoning—such are the grand numbers.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"One great era governs twelve conjunctions, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty generations, just as one year governs twelve months, three hundred sixty days, and four thousand three hundred twenty hours. The day is the era, the origin—its number is one. One year completes one cycle. The month is the conjunction, the meeting—its number is twelve. Twelve years complete twelve cycles. The star is the epoch, the movement of time, revolving leftward with the heavens, completing three hundred sixty cycles in a year. The hour is the generation, the end of change. One day has twelve hours, accumulating to four thousand three hundred twenty hours in a year. One generation spans thirty years, so twelve generations total one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years—this is the number of one great era. Within the great transformation, one era is like one year. From the era of the era to the hour of the era, from the era of the hour to the hour of the hour, the numbers are exhausted, and exhaustion brings change. The *Sublime World* records only the numbers of one era, yet from this, the numbers of Heaven and Earth may be known.\n\nOne era has one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years; one conjunction, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred months; one epoch, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred days; one generation, one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred hours—all are natural numbers, not artificially contrived.\n\nIt is also said: The first six conjunctions are waxing, the latter six waning. This is like a year, where from *zi* to *si* is waxing, and from *wu* to *hai* is waning. Things open at the seventy-fifth star, like the *Jingzhe* solar term of the year. Things close at the three hundred fifteenth star, like the *Lidong* solar term of the year.\n\nSome ask: \"The qi overflows at three hundred sixty-six days, while the lunar phases are deficient at three hundred fifty-four. Why does the *Sublime World* consistently use three hundred sixty as its standard?\" The answer: \"This is to conceal its application within. From *zi* to *si*, waxing occurs as yang advances and yin retreats. By the end of the *si* month, at the two thousand one hundred sixtieth hour, yang reaches its peak, leaving a remainder of six for both yin and yang. From *wu* to *hai*, waning occurs as yin advances and yang retreats. By the end of the *hai* month, at the four thousand three hundred twentieth hour, yin reaches its peak, again leaving a remainder of six for both yin and yang. These total twenty-four, corresponding to the three hundred eighty-four lines of the sixty-four hexagrams in the *Book of Changes*. Excluding the four cardinal hexagrams, there are six lines per hexagram. Four times six is twenty-four; subtracting twenty-four from three hundred eighty-four leaves three hundred sixty. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the four cardinal hexagrams, occupying the four directions and remaining unchanged in reversal.

Why? It is said: \"By projecting today’s movements of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and Five Phases backward, this was derived.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Divided into twelve, the first six limits are waxing, the latter six waning.

      "translated_text": "The count of the *Primordial Era*’s *primordial* divisions takes one as its unit. Each *conjunction* comprises ten thousand eighty *primordial* divisions; each *epoch* comprises three hundred sixty *primordial* divisions. Summing the divisions of one *era* yields one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred *primordial* divisions of the *Primordial Era*.\n\nYang’s three hundred sixty are advance; yin’s three hundred sixty are retreat. Combined, three hundred sixty form seven hundred twenty.\n\nIt is also said: divided into thirty, this corresponds to the thirty days of one month. Following the waxing and waning of the *Great Epoch*, advance and retreat span sixty days. This accords with the reckoning of *conjunctions* through *epochs*: one month of thirty days is one *conjunction* of thirty *epochs*.\n\nFrom the perspective of months, leaps and intercalations alternate in application—one advance, one retreat—waxing and waning each yielding sixty *epochs*. From the perspective of days, day and night are further divided in application. One advance, one retreat, leaps and intercalations each yielding their counts, then one month’s count becomes one hundred twenty days, and one *conjunction*’s count becomes one hundred twenty *epochs*.\n\nIt is further said: one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, divided into twelve, corresponds to the twelve hours of one day, with an advance and retreat of six days. This accords with the reckoning of *epochs* through *eras*: when reckoning *eras* through *conjunctions*, these are the counts of *Year Hexagrams* and *Month Hexagrams*; when reckoning *conjunctions* through *epochs*, these are the counts of *Qi Hexagrams* and *Phase Hexagrams*; when reckoning *epochs* through *eras*, these are the counts of *Day Hexagrams* and *Hour Hexagrams*.\n\nOne day of twelve hours is one *epoch* of twelve *eras*. One is one *second*; twelve *seconds* make one *minute*; thirty *minutes* make one *hour*. In total, one day comprises four thousand three hundred twenty *seconds*. One hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred are thus the *seconds* of thirty days.\n\nAccumulating the years of one *epoch* yields nearly five hundred fifty-nine million eight hundred seventy-two thousand *seconds*—this is the count of *Tai*.\n\nThe advance and retreat of six days represent the count of one transformation. When reckoned as years, six days become six years; advancing to sixty years, in the *Lesser Epoch* this is ten transformations, while in the *Great Epoch* it is one transformation. For the Dao of Heaven transforms through six, yet always with a remainder.\n\nThe lesser six days traverse six celestial stems: *jiazi* and *jiawu* each mark one *era*. Thus, the *Great Epoch* transforms once every sixty years—this is the count of the Five *Epochs*. Heaven begins at *jia* and governs at *zi*; Earth begins at *ji* and governs at *mao*. Between *jia* and *ji*, the central *Earth Epoch* is seen. Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire succeed one another in turn. Heaven ends at *guihai*; Earth ends at *wuyin*. Spoken separately, each has sixty; spoken together, they total sixty. Thus, one great transformation completes one celestial cycle.\n\nThe *Lesser Epoch* transforms once every six years—this is the count of the Six *Qi*. The Six *Qi* begin with Heaven at *zi* and end at *si*; Earth responds by beginning at *mao* and ending at *shen*. Heaven begins at *wu* and ends at *hai*; Earth responds by beginning at *you* and ending at *yin*. The *Celestial Controller* and *Terrestrial Controller*, combined, form the Six *Qi*; separated, they are twelve, and when twenty-four are combined, they become twelve and six. Thus, sixty transformations also complete one celestial cycle.\n\nTherefore, the *Great Epoch* transforms through sixty, and six transformations, with their remainders, yield three hundred sixty-six. The *Lesser Epoch* transforms through six, and sixty transformations, with their remainders, also yield three hundred sixty-six.\n\nIt is also said: three hundred sixty corresponds to the count of one *hour*. Following the advance and retreat of the *Lesser Epoch*, this corresponds to the hours of day and night. One *hour* is one *era*. From the perspective of *hours*, three hundred sixty are *seconds*; from the perspective of *eras*, three hundred sixty are months. Three hundred sixty months are thus the years of one *era*.\n\nWhen corresponding to the hours of day and night, one *hour* becomes one *hour*. One *hour* comprises one hundred eighty *seconds*; accumulating one day yields two thousand one hundred sixty *seconds*—half of the four thousand three hundred twenty *minutes* in one day.\n\nFollowing the waxing and waning of the *Great* and *Lesser Epochs*: the six months after *zi* are waxing; the six months after *wu* are waning. Following the advance and retreat of the *Lesser Epoch*: the six hours after *zi* are advance; the six hours after *wu* are retreat. The *Great Epoch* has waxing and waning but no advance or retreat; the *Lesser Epoch* has advance and retreat but no waxing or waning. Waxing and waning are the accumulation of advance and retreat. From *zi* to *si* is waxing; from *wu* to *hai* is waning.\n\nThis exhaustively presents the counts of one *era*, encompassing the counts of retreat and intercalation within. As for the sun and moon, within their waxing and waning, each has its own advance and retreat. One year contains only seven hundred thirty day-and-night cycles. The *Tai Xuan* takes one day-and-night as one day, combining odd and even to make three hundred sixty-five days. The *Canon of Eras* takes day and night as separate days, adding the surplus of yang and the deficit of yin, totaling twelve days to form one hundred twenty days. Combining one hundred twenty with seven hundred twenty yields eight hundred forty days—this is one year of three hundred sixty days, divided into two to include both day and night, and accounting for intercalation.\n\nThe remainder of six days is dispersed among the six *jia*, yielding sixty *jiazi*. The intercalary count of six days, combined to make one hundred twenty, serves the use of humans and all beings.\n\nWithin the six counts, days are divided into day and night, numbers into leaps and intercalations, each forming twelve. One becomes two, each encompassing waxing and waning; two becomes four, revealing one *limit*. Advancing sixty days, retreating sixty days—six *limits* advance and retreat, totaling three hundred sixty days. Another *limit* advances six days and retreats six days, together forming seven aspects of waxing and waning. Thus, fourteen *conjunctions* yield seven hundred twenty days, all using half-counts.\n\nSome say: advancing twelve days makes one hundred twenty; retreating twelve days also makes one hundred twenty.",

      "translated_text": "Combining the surplus of yang’s fullness, dividing the six intersecting counts of the new moon, six voids also suffice, and two hundred fifty-two likewise accords. It is also said: the establishment of the great and small cyclical counts.\n\nThe structural count numbers three hundred eighty-four, yet the operational count stops at three hundred sixty-one years, with the standard count yielding three hundred sixty. Applying the *Scripture of Epochs* to deduce it, using nine of twelve conjunctions yields two hundred seventy days. Now, within one *yuan* of three hundred sixty cycles, only two hundred forty cycles are used, and the intercalary count does not exceed two hundred fifty-two, for eight conjunctions are left unused. This is because *yin* opens at *yin* and closes at *xu*, and *xu* is also unused.\n\nHeaven has its seasons for generating beings, and Earth has its counts for generating beings. Speaking in terms of Heaven, one year uses three hundred sixty. Speaking in terms of Earth, from the sprouting of grasses and trees to the first freezing of the ground, only two hundred fifty-two are used. Thus, the *Diagram of Hexagram Qi* in days numbers three hundred eighty-four; in hours, it numbers two hundred fifty-six. There are only three thousand seventy-two hours—this is how the great and small cycles are distinguished.\n\nTaking the full twelve *limit*-counts, advancing and retreating three hundred sixty days, another *limit* advances six days and retreats likewise. Yin and yang continue in succession, dividing governance within one *yuan*. Speaking separately, each has three hundred sixty yin. Dividing the yang and analyzing the half-counts—if speaking in combination, yang advances while yin retreats, together forming three hundred sixty, for yang encompasses yin, totaling the full count.\n\nThus, this method of the great cycle, when distinguished from the intercalary count, clarifies the numbers of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, where standard and intercalary counts mutually generate, divide halves for common use, share a root yet bear different names.\n\nIt is also said: establishing the small cycle method at one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred. Removing the three of intersecting counts, taking the seven of operational counts. The operational method forms six from three, adding surplus fractions, hence seven. The great cycle method focuses on clarifying structure, so the structure of the small cycle may be known. The small cycle method focuses on clarifying function, so the function of the great cycle may be known. They mutually reveal one another.\n\nIn structure, it is the operational count of structure: three hundred sixty. In function, it is the operational count of function: two hundred fifty-two. Intersecting counts are unused counts. Operational counts manifest yang; intersecting counts conceal yin. Heaven unifies structure; Earth divides function.\n\nSpeaking of the count of one *yuan*, operational counts are seven and intersecting counts are three—yang prevails over yin. Seven parts of Heaven lie above Earth, while three parts intersect below Earth, referring to the division of day and night in *kan*, *li*, *mao*, and *you*. Yang encroaches upon yin, day encroaches upon night—this is the principle of three Heavens and two Earths.\n\nSpeaking of one day, from *yin* to *xu*. Speaking of twelve conjunctions, from *Opening Beings* to *Closing Beings*, within one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, nine myriads seven hundred twenty counts are taken for use. Speaking of day counts, within three hundred sixty days, seven-tenths are taken, yielding two hundred fifty-two for use. Speaking of one year, three-tenths of winter are unused. Speaking of one day, three-tenths of night are unused.\n\nAt the two solstices and two equinoxes, dividing three hundred sixty yields one hundred eighty. This is the count of their separation.\n\nMaster Zhu said: From the winter solstice to the spring equinox is advancing to the halfway point, hence called *equinox*. From the spring equinox to the summer solstice is advancing to the extreme, hence called *solstice*. Advancing past the extreme leads to retreating to the solstice; the autumn equinox is retreating halfway. Reaching the winter solstice is retreating to the extreme.\n\nThe *Nine Yangs of One Hundred Six* cycle. In years of flood and drought, the cyclical movements have constancy. According to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars*: nineteen years make one *zhang*. Four *zhang* make one *bu*, twenty *bu* make one *tong*. Three *tong* make one *yuan*, totaling four thousand five hundred sixty years. Entering the *yuan* at one hundred six years, there is *Yang Nine*, referring to nine years of drought. Next, at three hundred seventy-four years, there is *Yin Nine*, referring to nine years of flood. Combining one hundred six years and three hundred seventy-four years yields four hundred eighty years. The annotation states: the number of six multiplied by eight.\n\nThis is from Wei Heshān’s *Essential Meanings*. In my humble opinion: history records that the Han dynasty suffered the calamity of *Yang Nine*. Yao endured nine years of flood, and Tang endured seven years of drought. From this, it may be deduced. Yet Yao and Shun, through virtue, mitigated change, for floods and droughts arise from Heaven’s counts and thus could not cause harm. The Han dynasty’s calamity, however, arose from human action and cannot be wholly attributed to Heaven. Thus it is said: “Heaven-made disasters may yet be avoided; self-made disasters cannot be escaped.” This is what it means.\n\nThe middle count is called *sui*; the new-moon count is called *nian*. The Grand Scribe oversees the correction of *sui* and *nian* to order affairs. The middle count refers to twelve months, with the total of midpoints numbering three hundred sixty-five and one-quarter days, called *sui*. The new-moon count refers to the new moons of twelve months, one cycle numbering three hundred fifty-four days, called *nian*. This is the contrast between *sui* and *nian*, hence the distinction between new moon and midpoint. Yet if spoken of separately, they are one.\n\nThe *Erya*’s *Explanation of Heaven* states: In the Tang and Yu dynasties, it was called *zai*; in the Xia, *sui*; in the Shang, *si*; in the Zhou, *nian*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Shao Kangjie’s twelve conjunctions of one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred years, when deduced from small to large, are all uniform, meaning years, months, days, and hours all align. The first conjunction of ten thousand eighty years is when Heaven first opens. The second conjunction of ten thousand eighty years is when Earth first congeals. The third conjunction is when beings first arise, called *Opening Beings*. This time belongs to *yin*; at *xu*, it is *Closing Beings*, the time when beings are extinguished.

      "translated_text": "When the first *yuan* reaches its end, Heaven and Earth undergo another unfolding. Taking the single *qi* of Heaven and Earth as an analogy, one day and one night suffice to illustrate this. From this winter solstice to the next, the *qi* completes one cycle. Dividing it into two segments, the first is *yang*, the latter *yin*. Further dividing it into four yields the four seasons. Spring and summer exhale, autumn and winter inhale—it is but a single *qi*. Once *yang* *qi* ascends to its peak, it nears exhaustion, and *yin* arises. As *yin* *qi* nears its end, *yang* is born anew. The *qi* that has been expended disperses—this is what is meant by waxing and waning.\n\nHeaven’s revolution in a month sees the sun complete one rotation, yet there are also times of greater turning that cannot be confined to a single pattern.\n\nIn my humble observation: *Qian* and *Kun* are the gates of the *Yi*. The *Fu* and *Gou* hexagrams serve as the hinges and bolts of these gates, opening and closing them. From *zi*, when *yang* is born, the gate of *Qian* opens. Its movement is also called *Heaven opens at zi and yin*. Thus, the Dipper’s handle points here, and the unfolding begins. Its name is *Zhen*, and the ten thousand things emerge. *Qian* divides them, and so it continues until *si*. From *wu*, when the first *yin* is born, the gate of *Kun* closes. Its stillness is contraction. *Xun* causes *yin* to diminish and *yang* to grow, and the ten thousand things enter. *Kun* conceals them, and so it continues until *hai*. One opening, one closing—like two doors. When one opens, the other closes. When *yang* comes, it opens; when *yang* departs, it closes.\n\nViewed thus, the earlier scholars’ saying that when expansion prevails, Heaven and Earth transform and the grasses and trees flourish, while when expansion fails, Heaven and Earth close and the worthy withdraw—this too depends on humanity. When Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu ruled above, the eras of Tang, Yu, Shang, and Zhou were bright with *yang*. Otherwise, upright scholars were imprisoned as slaves, poison and pain spread across the four seas, books were burned and scholars buried, the world dissolved, stones moved, Zhu Wen defiled human relations, and Heaven and Earth were overturned. At such times, without waiting, the sun and moon lost their light, the cosmos darkened, and beings could not but be consumed. Alas! Such things are hard to speak of.",

      "translated_text": "It is further said: Heaven opens at *zi*, Earth unfolds at *chou*, and humans are born in the month of the Three Luminaries—all may serve as the beginning of the year, and the Three Dynasties successively adopted them. The Xia took *yin* as the human standard, the Shang took *chou* as the earthly standard, and the Zhou took *zi* as the heavenly standard. Yet when it comes to conducting affairs by the seasons, the year and months ought naturally to be reckoned by the human standard. Thus Confucius once said, “I have obtained the Xia calendar,” and commentators took this to refer to works like the *Xia Xiao Zheng*, for he valued its seasonal correctness and the excellence of its ordinances.\n\nSomeone asked: Why did the Shang and Zhou, in changing the first month of the year, not attain the correctness of the Xia calendar? The answer is: Though *yang* qi begins at *huangzhong*, its month is *jianzi*. Yet it still lies concealed within the earth, and its power to generate life remains unseen. When the calendar turns from *chou* to *yin*, the three *yang* are complete. Then the harmonious winds arrive, the great *power* resides in Wood, and the spring *qi* responds. The sages of antiquity took this as the beginning of life’s generation and the starting point of the year’s renewal—based on what all people could observe. □ speaking of it, none knew its true origin.\n\nAs for the Shang and Zhou, they first gained the world through military conquest. Thereupon they altered the first month of the year, establishing it as an institution for their dynasties, to renew the perceptions of the world, and thus arose the theory of the Three Sequences. Yet in terms of Heaven, the power to generate life was not yet manifest; in terms of Earth, the meaning of the year’s renewal was unclear. Moreover, the order of the four seasons and five phases could not attain central correctness. This is why Confucius examined the institutions of the Three Kings and chose to follow the Xia calendar.\n\nUpon reviewing various transmitted records, though the Three Dynasties differed in their first month of the year, all began their reckoning with *jianyin*. For court assemblies and the distribution of calendars to mark the seasons, they conducted affairs by the first month of the year. Yet in counting the months, all took *yin* as the first. The *Yi Xun* speaks of “the twelfth month,” and the date “yichou” refers to the Shang, which took *jianchou* as the first month, thus making the twelfth month the first. *Yichou* is the day, not tied to the new moon, for it is not the first day of the month. As for changing the first month of the year without altering the count of months, this can still be verified in the classics and histories.\n\nThe Zhou took *jianzi* as the first month, yet the *Book of Songs* speaks of “the fourth month” and “the sixth month of summer.” The *Zuozhuan* counts months from *yin*, never altering it. The Qin took *jianhai* as the first month, yet the *Records of the Grand Historian* states that in the thirty-first year of the First Emperor, “the twelfth month was renamed *La*, called *Jiaping*.” Now, *La* is the *jianchou* month. If the Qin took *hai* as the first month, then *La* would be the third month. Saying it was the eleventh month shows that the Qin, too, counted months from *yin* and never altered it. In the thirty-seventh year, it records: “In the tenth month, *guichou*, the First Emperor went on a tour. In the eleventh month, he reached Yunmeng.” Then it continues: “In the seventh month, *bingyin*, the First Emperor died. In the ninth month, he was buried at Mount Li.” That it first records the tenth and eleventh months, then the seventh and ninth, shows that it took the tenth month as the first of the year but still counted months from *yin*, never altering it.\n\nThe Qin official records state that the year’s beginning was changed, and court congratulations were all held on the first day of the tenth month. The Qin succeeded the Zhou; if it had changed the count of months, then the Zhou’s tenth month would have been *jianyou*. How could it then be *jianhai*? The Han followed the Qin first month, and the histories record: “In the first year, winter, the tenth month,” making it clear that the first month of the year was changed but the count of months was not.\n\nMoreover, according to the Han scholar Kong, spring was taken as the *jianzi* month, for he held that the Three Dynasties, in changing the first month of the year, also altered the count of months and took their first month as the head of the four seasons. The *Tai Shi* speaks of “the first month, *wuwu*,” where “one” is a corruption of “three.” Since he took the first month as *jianzi*, and the classic also associates it with spring, he thus took the *jianzi* month as spring. Yet in reality, the first month is early spring. If this were so, the four seasons would be disordered, which is even more unreasonable. Winter cannot be made spring, nor cold made warm—this is evident without need for argument.\n\nSomeone said: Zheng’s commentary on the *Book of Songs*, “Wei Mo’s spring,” also refers to the Zhou’s late spring, which in the Xia calendar is early spring. The answer is: This is an error inherited by the Han scholars. The “Ministers and Workers” poem speaks of late spring, when they should prepare their new offerings. Yet how is it now? The wheat is about to ripen, and they can receive the bright gifts of the Supreme Lord. When wheat is about to ripen, it is the *jianchen* month, clearly the late spring of the Xia calendar. Zheng’s commentary on the *Book of Songs* fails to grasp its meaning and interprets it inaccurately. Otherwise, the Shang would take late winter as spring, and the Zhou would take mid-winter as spring, reversing the four seasons and losing their correctness. How could the sages of the Three Dynasties, in following Heaven’s governance, have done this?\n\nIt is further said: Though the Zhou took *zi* as the first month and thus attained the heavenly sequence, Confucius’ discussion of governing a state took the Xia calendar as correct, for it clearly follows the beginning and end of *yin* and *yang*. *Yang* begins at *zi* and ends at *si*; *yin* begins at *wu* and ends at *hai*. In terms of the *qi* of the four seasons, *yang* begins at *yin* and ends at *wei*, while *yin* begins at *shen* and ends at *chou*. Though these two accounts seem to differ slightly, the discrepancy is only two positions.\n\nAt the *zi* position, though one *yang* is born, it has not yet emerged from the earth. At the *yin* position, the *Tai* hexagram, the three *yang* have just emerged above the earth, and the warm, generous *qi* begins from this point. At the *si* position, the *Qian* hexagram, though the six *yang* are at their peak, the warm, generous *qi* has not yet ended. Thus, though one *yin* is born at *wu*, it does not yet harm the *yang*. Only at the *wei* position, the *Dun* hexagram, does the warm, generous *qi* finally dissipate. At the *wu* position, though *yin* has been born, the severe, congealing *qi* only begins at *shen*.",
      "overlap_context": ", Wen, and Wu ruled above, the eras of Tang, Yu, Shang, and Zhou were bright with *yang*. Otherwise, upright scholars were imprisoned as slaves, poison and pain spread across the four seas, books were burned and scholars buried, the world dissolved, stones moved, Zhu Wen defiled human relations, and Heaven and Earth were overturned. At such times, without waiting, the sun and moon lost their light, the cosmos darkened, and beings could not but be consumed. Alas! Such things are hard to speak of.",

      "translated_text": "At the *hai* position, though the six *yin* are at their peak, the severe, congealing *qi* only dissipates at *chou*. The principle here follows the same pattern.\n\nShao Kangjie’s *Twelve Conjunctions* states that at *zi*, Heaven exists but Earth has not yet formed; at *chou*, Earth exists but humanity has not yet appeared; and only at *yin* does humanity emerge—all marking the beginnings of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. Thus, the Three Dynasties took these starting points and established them as their first months. Hence it is said: the establishment of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* as the first months all belong to the three *yang* months. If the Qin had taken *hai* as the first month, it would have been entirely baseless.\n\nIt is further said: Within the *Xiantian* Diagram, the twelve *bi* hexagrams are also contained. On the left side, from *zi* to *si*, there are thirty-two *yang* hexagrams. Beginning with *Zhen*, *Fu* divides into sixteen hexagrams. The second *yang* ascends to *Dui*, forming *Lin*; from *Lin* upward through eight hexagrams, it enters the *Qian* palace and ascends. The third *yang* forms *Tai*, the fourth *Zhuang*, the fifth *Da Zhuang*, and the sixth *Qian*, concluding the fourth month. On the right side, from *wu* to *hai*, there are thirty-two *yin* hexagrams. *Xun* generates *Sheng*, dividing into sixteen hexagrams. The second *yin* descends to *Gen*, forming *Dun*; from *Dun* downward through eight hexagrams, it enters the *Kun* palace and descends. The third *yin* forms *Pi*, the fourth *Guan*, the fifth *Bo*, and the sixth *Kun*, concluding the tenth month. The *yang* hexagrams take one from the *Zhen* palace and four from the *Qian* palace. The *yin* hexagrams take one from the *Xun* palace and four from the *Kun* palace. This illustrates that the two *qi* of *yin* and *yang*—at their inception, they are subtle and gradual; at their culmination, they are swift and intense. Subtle and gradual, they root and nourish the source of the myriad things. Swift and intense, they generate and destroy the myriad things, accomplishing their work.\n\nThe *Kan* and *Li* palaces are not taken, for they show that the two *qi* of water and fire flow between Heaven and Earth. What is not used here is in fact used everywhere without exception. The *bi* hexagrams, laid out flat, correspond to the four seasons in pairs, so that the twenty-four solar terms and seventy-two pentads are arranged within them without disorder. The eight palaces of the *Xiantian* Diagram stand in fixed opposition. Among the twelve *bi* hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* alone govern eight of them. Thus, the father and mother of the myriad things—birth, growth, harvest, and storage—all proceed from these.\n\nMaster Shao said: The Dao began with Fuxi, was perfected under Yao, reformed by the Three Kings, reached its limit with the Five Hegemons, and was severed by the Qin. The order and chaos of the myriad things in recent times cannot escape this pattern. It began with Fuxi, who opened things at *yin*. It was perfected under Yao, when *yang* was pure at *si*. It was reformed by the Three Kings, when *yin* was born at *wu*. It reached its limit with the Five Hegemons, when the *yang* Dao was exhausted. It was severed by the Qin, which imposed a barrier. What Master Shao called the principles of emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons—father and son, lord and minister—were all bounded by the Qin. The boundary was cut off at the Qin, and the Dao could no longer be practiced.\n\nIt is further said: The *Book of Changes* began with the Three Sovereigns, the *Book of Documents* with the Two Emperors, the *Book of Songs* with the Three Kings, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* with the Five Hegemons. This theory holds that the era of the Two Sovereigns was like spring, the era of the Five Emperors like summer, the era of the Three Kings like autumn, and the era of the Five Hegemons like winter. It is also said: The Seven States were the lingering embers of winter. The Han was a king but fell short; the Jin was a hegemon but had excess. The Three Kingdoms were the heroes of hegemony; the Sixteen Kingdoms were a thicket of hegemons. The Southern Five Dynasties were hegemons riding on borrowed power; the Five Dynasties were a relay station for hegemons. The Sui was the younger brother of the Tang; the late Sui’s various commanderies were hegemons, the last ripples of the Yangzi and Han. The late Tang’s various warlords were hegemons, the lingering light of the sun and moon. The Later Five Dynasties were hegemons, stars at dawn.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Before Yao, there were also those like the Five Hegemons. Within the great cycles, there are smaller cycles to distinguish them in detail. Only the closer eras are visible, as earlier records have not been transmitted. Master Shao’s statement that within the eras of emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons, there are further emperors, kings, rulers, and hegemons is correct. Taking the Han dynasty as an example, even within it there were emperors, kings, and hegemons among the shorn barbarians. Those who ruled by non-action were emperors like Gaozu and Empress Lü; those who ruled by benevolence and trust were emperors like Emperor Wen; those who ruled by cunning and force were hegemons like Emperor Wu. Emperor Xuan was a king among hegemons; Emperor Wu was a hegemon among kings. This is like the four seasons: spring, autumn, winter, summer. Hegemons who were barbarians ranked even lower.\n\nAlas! How fortunate it would be to have lived in the time of the Three Sovereigns.\n\nIt is further said: The *qi* of Heaven and Earth moves from north to south to bring order, and from south to north to bring chaos. When chaos has lasted long, it returns from north to south. This is true of both the Dao of Heaven and human affairs. Extending this to successive dynasties reveals the principle of waxing and waning.\n\nIt is also said: *Yin* affairs exceed half, for *yang* is one while *yin* is two. Thus, ordered eras are few while chaotic eras are many; the noble are few while the petty are many. In my humble opinion: The numbers of *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* cycles—one *yun* spans 360 years—can be used to infer the order and chaos of successive dynasties. From *zi* to *mao* is *yin* within *yang*, heralding order. From *mao* to *wu* is *yang* within *yang*, the height of order. From *wu* to *you* is *yang* within *yin*, heralding chaos. From *you* to *zi* is *yin* within *yin*, the height of chaos.\n\nIn the *Xiantian* Diagram, from *Tai* through *Gu* to *Pi*, and from *Pi* through *Sui* to *Tai*, this is the cycle of north and south. For *Tai* and *Pi* stand opposite each other, as do *Gu* and *Sui*. Thus it is said: from *Tai* to *Pi*, *Gu* lies between them. Who brings about *Gu*? It is when *yin* prevails, *yang* is halted by *Gen*, and the *yin* evil of *Xun* enters—then *Pi* arrives. From *Pi* to *Tai*, *Sui* lies between them. Who brings about *Sui*? It is when *yang* of *Zhen* moves in accord, and the *yin* of *Dui* follows—then the people rejoice without bound, and *Tai* is fitting in all ways. These *Pi*, *Tai*, *Gu*, and *Sui* are perhaps the gates of Heaven and Earth, the paths of humanity and spirits, the intersections of entry and exit.",

Midway, southerners held power, and the southern creatures followed the *qi*, overstepping the north and bringing chaos. Master Kangjie deduced this through numerology: six *jiazi* cycles make three hundred and sixty years, corresponding to the twelve hours of a day. The reckoning begins with the *jiachen* year of Yao, with the months *si*, *chen*, *wei*, and the star *gui*. Now, the moon still resides in *Wu*, while the celestial stem has just passed *You*. This accounts for three thousand six hundred and sixty years, yet only one hundred and twenty-two hours have elapsed. How swift it is! The span from ancient times to the present, within Heaven and Earth, is but a single day and night.\n\nThe sage comprehends the Dao of day and night and thus knows how to observe a single hour to understand all hours, a single generation to understand all generations. I have recorded the world’s fortunes across the twelve epochs. When an epoch ends, how could one not feel moved?\n\n**The Governance of *Qi***\n\nThe earthly numbers begin with two. Two multiplied by six makes the twelve months; two multiplied by four makes the twenty-four *qi*; two multiplied by three makes the seventy-two *hou*. Within these twelve sovereign hexagrams lie the seventy-two *hou*. Within the four cardinal hexagrams lie the twenty-four *qi*. Within the sixty hexagrams lie the three hundred and sixty days.\n\nThe Han initially designated *Jingzhe* as the central *qi* of the first month and *Yushui* as the first month’s solar term. This was later revised at the end of the Former Han. Thus, the *Lüli Zhi* states: \"In the first month, *Lichun* is the solar term and *Yushui* the central *qi*; in the second month, *Jingzhe* is the solar term and *Chunfen* the central *qi*.\" It speaks of hibernating creatures: in the first month, they first stir; in the second, they stir greatly. Hence, the later text states: \"In the *Santong* calendar, *Guyu* is the third month’s solar term and *Qingming* the central *qi*.\" According to the *Tonggua Yan* and the current calendar, *Qingming* is the third month’s solar term and *Guyu* the central *qi*; the rest align with the *Lüli Zhi*.\n\nThe *Yueling* records the seasonal phenomena of the twelve months, though its structure varies. Some *qi* and *hou* are listed in order, others out of sequence. For the months of the two solstices and two equinoxes, phenomena are recorded twice, for these are the beginnings and endings of *yin* and *yang*, the intersections of their exchange. These are the great nodes, which the sage-kings treated with utmost care.\n\nThe *Yi* says: \"*Kan* is the hexagram of the true north.\" It also says: \"*Dui* is the true autumn.\" And again: \"The former kings, on the solstices, closed the gates.\" The later generations’ *qi*, seasons, and sequences were already fully contained in the *Yi*. Since *Kan* is called the hexagram of the true north, then *Zhen* as east, *Dui* as west, and *Li* as south are self-evident. When *Dui* is called the true autumn, it refers to the autumnal equinox; thus, *Zhen* corresponds to the vernal equinox, *Li* to the summer solstice, and *Kan* to the winter solstice—these are self-evident. The *Daxiang* of *Fu* states that on the solstice, the gates are closed, referring to the winter solstice; thus, *Gou* corresponds to the summer solstice—this, too, is self-evident. One who understands the *Yi* can grasp the waxing and waning of *yin* and *yang* *qi* through analogy.\n\nMaster Wei of Heshān said: \"Autumn is the *yin* within *yin*; spring is the *yang* within *yang*. The *yin* *qi* begins in the fifth month and ends in the tenth, so the seventh and eighth months are the *yin* within *yin*. Though *yang* is present within *yin*, *yin* dominates. The *yang* *qi* begins in the eleventh month and ends in the fourth, so the first and second months are the *yang* within *yang*. Though *yin* is present within *yang*, *yang* dominates.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"From this year’s winter solstice to the next, it is but a single cycle of *qi*. Divided in two, spring and summer are *yang*, autumn and winter are *yin*. Divided into four, they become the four seasons. Further divided, they become the twenty-four *qi* and seventy-two *hou*—all originating from this.\"\n\n**The Twenty-Four *Qi***\n\nAs Kongzi said:\n- First month: *Lichun* (solar term), *Yushui* (central *qi*)\n- Second month: *Jingzhe* (solar term), *Chunfen* (central *qi*)\n- Third month: *Guyu* (solar term), *Qingming* (central *qi*)\n- Fourth month: *Lixia* (solar term), *Xiaoman* (central *qi*)\n- Fifth month: *Mangzhong* (solar term), *Xiazhi* (central *qi*)\n- Sixth month: *Xiaoshu* (solar term), *Dashu* (central *qi*)\n- Seventh month: *Liqiu* (solar term), *Chushu* (central *qi*)\n- Eighth month: *Bailu* (solar term), *Qiufen* (central *qi*)\n- Ninth month: *Hanlu* (solar term), *Shuangjiang* (central *qi*)\n- Tenth month: *Lidong* (solar term), *Xiaoxue* (central *qi*)\n- Eleventh month: *Daxue* (solar term), *Dongzhi* (central *qi*)\n- Twelfth month: *Xiaohan* (solar term), *Dahan* (central *qi*)\n\n*Yushui* (Rain Water): Snow disperses into rain. Falling from above is called rain; the north wind freezes it into snow, and the east wind thaws it into water.\n*Jingzhe* (Awakening of Insects): Hibernating creatures stir and emerge.\n*Guyu* (Grain Rain): Rain nurtures the hundred grains.\n*Qingming* (Pure Brightness): All things grow pure, bright, and clean.\n*Xiaoman* (Lesser Fullness): Things grow to a small measure of fullness.\n*Mangzhong* (Grain in Beard): Grains with beards may be sown.\n*Xiaoshu* and *Dashu* (Lesser and Greater Heat): The peak of heat is divided into lesser and greater, with the former at the month’s beginning and the latter at its midpoint.\n*Chushu* (End of Heat): Heat retreats and hides.\n*Bailu* (White Dew): *Yin* *qi* gradually intensifies, and dew congeals, turning white.\n*Hanlu* (Cold Dew): The *qi* of dew grows cold, nearing congelation.\n*Xiaoxue* and *Daxue* (Lesser and Greater Snow): In the tenth month, snow is light; in the eleventh, it grows heavy.\n*Xiaohan* and *Dahan* (Lesser and Greater Cold): In the twelfth month, cold is light at the beginning and severe at the midpoint.\n\nEach of the twenty-four *qi* spans slightly more than fifteen days. Dividing each *qi* in half yields forty-eight *qi*, each lasting slightly more than seven and a half days. The *Zhouli* speaks of eighteen arrows for the sun, meaning one arrow is changed with each *qi*. Between the twenty-four *qi*, dividing the *qi* into three parts yields slightly more than five days, hence the seventy-two *hou* in a year.\n\nMaster Ou said: \"For the seventy-two *hou*, each is placed at the midpoint of a solar term. The beginning of a term is a *hou*. By accumulating the *hou* in the hexagrams, one arrives at the central *qi*, which corresponds to the next hexagram. Naming them according to the Five Phases’ governance yields the hexagrams of the dukes.\"",

      "translated_text": "By accumulating the counting rods, one arrives at the inception of spring wood, summer fire, autumn metal, and winter water. Placing the nodes of the four seasons yields the governance of earth. The lines of the twelve sovereign hexagrams correspond to the midpoints of the seventy-two *hou*. The first *hou* precedes the new *qi* by three days, while the latter follows the new *qi* by three days. As the *hou* divide the inner and outer, sixty hexagrams correspond to the three hundred sixty days of the year. With twelve months and twelve central *qi*, the subsequent *hou* of sixty-four are placed at the four *li*. The nodes of winter are reckoned by the *wei* counting rods. Adding these yields the twelve duke hexagrams to govern them.\n\nFor example, in the eleventh month, the initial six of *Kan* (坎) is the central *qi* of sincerity, corresponding to the sovereign hexagram *Fu* (復) and the *hou* of *Zhun* (屯), which spans three days. The nine-two of *Kan* corresponds to the *hou* of *Zhun* externally, the minister hexagram *Qian* (謙), and the *qing* hexagram *Kui* (睽), which is the subsequent hexagram three days after the *qi*.\n\nThe four *li*—wood at *Lixia* (立夏), fire at *Lixia* (立夏, seasonal month), the month of the winter solstice as the duke’s central inner *qi* preceding the new *qi* of the twelfth month—along with *Lidong* (立冬) for water and *Liqiu* (立秋) for metal, are all the initial nodes of the four *meng* seasons where the Five Phases govern. *Gen* (艮) and *Xun* (巽) occupy the four corner positions, dividing the six *qi*. The four seasons—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—are the times when earth governs. *Kan* (坎), *Li* (離), *Zhen* (震), and *Dui* (兌) are the four cardinal hexagrams.\n\nEach hexagram’s two lines govern five hexagrams, completing a month’s governance as the new moon. One line governs two and a half hexagrams. Six lines govern fifteen hexagrams, completing a season of three months. Taken together, the four seasons yield four times six, totaling twenty-four. Examined in detail, there are nodes, *qi*, and *hou*, each ordered without confusion.\n\nI have tentatively interpreted this according to my understanding—whether it aligns with Master Ou’s intent remains uncertain. Some say: in the first month of *jia* and *si*, there are six changes; in twelve months, seventy-two changes. Calling these *hou* is also plausible.\n\nThe *Kao of the Celestial Controller* states: seventy-two is the number of the Five Phases’ transformations and completions. This is the canonical method. The counting rods of yang: thirty-six, doubled. The counting rods of yin: twenty-four, tripled. The numbers of yin and yang never fail to harmonize. The seventy-two *hou* are likewise derived from this principle. The seventy-two *hou* were employed by the royal astronomer in the calendar, reaching the utmost precision.

For *Kun*: one line is twenty-four, three lines seventy-two, and six lines one hundred forty-four. Applied to one year, this exhausts the number of three hundred sixty days. Further dividing by the flourishing of the Five Phases: Water, Wood, Fire, and Metal each govern one season, totaling four times seven, or two hundred eighty-eight days. Seventy-two days remain to complete a full cycle. Thus, Earth governs the four seasons, with eighteen days per season corresponding to the months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Additionally, six days each month belong to Earth, aligning with the six lines of a hexagram in a month, demonstrating that the Five Phases cannot be separated from Earth. In all four seasons of the year and all six days of a month, Earth is lodged within them to govern. Therefore, between Heaven and Earth, the myriad people, things, affairs, and transformations all rely upon it as the ground for birth, growth, harvest, and storage—hence the term *hou*.\n\nReaders should appreciate the unceasing effort in contemplation, for it concerns nothing more than the transformations of *jia* and *si*.\n\nMaster Zhang of *Guanwu* states: The four seasons and eight solar terms each undergo three changes, with ten days constituting a *xun*. Three *xun* make a month, nine *xun* a season, and thirty-six *xun* complete the four seasons. Five days make a *hou*. Three *hou* form a *qi*, nine *hou* a solar term, and seventy-two *hou* complete the eight solar terms. Heaven has four seasons; each season has four months, and each month forty days. Four times four is sixteen, but one is subtracted from each, leaving three months per season and thirty days per month. Though the numerical structure is four, one is consistently unused. The operative numbers are three and nine. Thus, three *xun* make a month, and three months—ninety days—make a season. Five days make a *hou*, so one month has six *hou*, and five times six is thirty days. Three *hou* make a *qi*, totaling fifteen days. Nine *hou* make a solar term, and eight times nine *hou* complete the cycle of *qi* and solar terms.\n\nI have long lamented that today’s calendar officials merely record the names of the *hou* without delving into their meanings. Let me enumerate them one by one to prevent them from falling into the realm of what the common people use daily yet remain unaware of.\n\n**The Names and Meanings of the Seventy-Two *Hou***\n\nThe *hou* begins with \"earthworms coil\" in the eleventh month, corresponding to the winter solstice and the first day of the *jiazi* superior epoch. The *hou* \"east wind thaws\" begins with the first month, as the Five Dynasties’ Ma Chongxu’s new calendar prioritized the Rain Water solar term in the first month.\n\n**First Month**\n- *East wind thaws*: The spring wind disperses the cold and frozen *qi*.\n- *Hibernating insects stir*: They begin to move but have not yet emerged; by the second month, they awaken in great alarm.\n- *Fish rise to the ice*: During the height of cold, they lurk beneath the ice, seeking warmth. By the first month, as yang *qi* ascends, they swim near the surface beneath the ice.\n- *Otters sacrifice fish*: At this time, fish are plump and delicious; otters first offer them in sacrifice before eating.\n- *Wild geese arrive*: The great *hong* and lesser *li* return from abroad to China, soon to fly north to their nests.\n\nThe *Tongshu Yan* states: At the Start of Spring, pheasants call and hens lay eggs; at Rain Water, the *tiao* wind descends.

After another five days, the *cang geng* sings, its plumage turning yellow. It is also called *huang li liu*, or *wu huang*. In *Shang Geng*, it is known as the *chu que*; in Qi, people call it *bo shu*. Today, it is named the *bu gu*, as its call resembles *bo shu*. The *hong jiu* and *gu hong* are among its names. The hawk transforms into the turtledove, and by autumn, the turtledove reverts to a hawk.\n\nThe *xuan* is the swallow. It is also called the *yi* bird, arriving when life flourishes. It nests in the eaves of houses to breed, symbolizing marriage—thus, in ancient times, *Shang Jian Di* swallowed an egg and gave birth to *Qi*. Yang lies trapped within yin and cannot emerge; when it strikes forth, thunder resounds. The sound of yang is thunder, while its light is lightning. Yang is external, and yin clings to it, thus flashing and forming lightning. It is also said: lightning is the light of yang, and when yang is weak, its light is unseen. As yang gradually strengthens and strikes yin, its light becomes visible—hence, it is called the \"beginning of lightning.\"\n\nIn the third month, the paulownia begins to blossom. The field mouse transforms into the *jia*—the cuckoo. Another account states: the *mu wu* mouse, a creature of yin, transforms into the *jia* when yang *qi* prevails. When yin *qi* dominates, the *jia* reverts to a mouse.\n\nThe rainbow is called *fu lian*. The bright and vivid one is the male rainbow; the faint and subdued one is the female rainbow. The rainbow is the *qi* of yin and yang in union. When pure yin overcomes yang, the rainbow does not appear. If clouds thin and sunlight breaks through, illuminating raindrops, a rainbow forms.\n\nThe *ping* is floating duckweed. It is also called *ping* or *zao*, a water plant. When the *wu jiu* preens its feathers, silkworms are about to emerge. Its flight and wing-beating urge haste in farming. The *hong jiu*, also called the *que gu*, resembles a small mountain magpie. Dark blue-black with a short tail and many calls, it is thus named the *ming jiu*.\n\nThe *dai sheng* descends upon the mulberry—this is the *zhi wei* bird, also called the *ya jiu*. Its descent upon the mulberry signals that women should attend to their fundamental duties. The *Nei Zai* states: In the second month of spring, the matrons are commanded to tend the mulberry trees, bathe silkworm eggs, and invoke the essence of the *Long Jing*. When the moon aligns with *Da Huo*, the eggs are bathed.\n\nIn the fourth month, the *lou gu* calls—this is the croaking frog. The *Zhou Li*’s *Guo Shi* annotation states: Frogs croak with furious voices when summer *qi* is at its peak. The earthworm, a creature of yin, emerges in response to the pure yang *qi*. The *wang gua* grows red, born of the fire *qi*. The *ku cai* blooms, its bitter taste formed by the fire *qi*. *Mi cao* refers to delicate grasses, their slender stems and leaves giving them this name. By the sixth month of yang, grasses of yin cannot withstand the yang and perish.\n\nIn the fifth month, the *tang lang* is born. It is also called *cheng hao*, or *bu ying*. Its young are called *piao qiao*. In Yan and Zhao, it is eaten as *li*; in Qi and Qi’s east, it is called *ma gu zhe*. Its first call in the seventh month heralds the approach of cold. In the late-cold lands of Bin, it calls in the fifth month.\n\nThe *fan she* is the *bai she*, today called the frog. Its tongue is fixed at the base to the side of its mouth, with the tip curling inward. Some claim to have dissected it and found its tongue curled backward. Zheng disputes this, noting that the *fan she* begins calling in spring and gradually ceases by the fifth month. Its voice frequently shifts, hence the name *fan she*. Alternatively, the frog’s tongue may naturally curl, not necessarily making it the *fan she*.\n\nThe deer, a creature of yin, sheds its antlers in response to yin *qi*—hence, physicians use deer antler velvet to supplement yin. The cicada, also of yin, calls in response. The *ban xia* sprouts—this is the name of a medicinal herb. At the extreme of yin, yang is born.\n\nIn the sixth month, the warm wind begins to arrive, its gentle and abundant *qi* reaching its peak in late summer. The *xi shuai*, also called *can* or *cu shi*, is born in the earth. By late summer, its wings have nearly formed, though it cannot yet fly far, so it dwells in walls. By the seventh month, it flies far into the wild.",

They reinforce the four sides of their burrows, narrowing the openings to let in light, for the season remains warm and they must still venture out. Only in the tenth month, when the cold grows severe, do they close them entirely.\nThunder’s voice emerges in the second month amid yang, and recedes in the eighth month amid yin.\nAs yin contracts, waters begin to dry up.\nThe *Guo Yu* states: \"When the Horn of Chen appears, the rains cease; when the Root of Heaven appears, the waters dry.\" The rains cease and the yin path is established; the waters dry and bridges form.\nThe eighth-month lunar lodge aligns with the Pleiades and the Net, which govern rain.\nThe Root of Heaven lies between the chambers of Fang.\nWhen the Horn of Chen appears...\nWhen the Root of Heaven appears at the ninth month’s end, the interval between root and end spans twenty-one days and some remainder.\n\nIn the ninth month,\nthe swan-goose arrives as a guest.

The elk is a yin creature, and at the winter solstice, receiving the first yang, it sheds its antlers.\nSprings and streams stir—this is the work of Kan, the yang born of Heaven’s One.\n\nIn the twelfth month,\nthe wild goose faces north, turning from south to north.\nThe early ones face north this month; the late ones do so in the second month.\nThe magpie begins to nest, for it knows the year’s position and anticipates the coming year’s *qi*, hence it builds its nest.\nThe early ones do so in the eleventh month.\nThe *Poetry* weft states: \"On the day of return, the magpie begins its nest\"—this is the case.\nThe pheasant crows—it is a fire creature, and sensing yang, it calls.\nThe chicken breeds—it is a wood creature, and clinging to yang, it takes form, hence it breeds at the advent of the Spring Commencement node, for the Spring Commencement lies within this month.\nThe hawk grows fierce and swift, for the season’s killing *qi* reaches its peak, and so the hawk’s ferocity intensifies, seizing birds with speed.\n*Yan* means \"fierce.\"\nThe marshes and lakes freeze to their depths—the ice grows thick within, meaning the depths are solid.\nThis occurs in the lunar lodge of the Dark Dripping Maiden, the Void, and the Rooftop.\nThe earth-ox is brought forth—this is the beginning of labor.",

      "translated_text": "The month is aligned with *chou* (丑), which corresponds to earth, and earth can overcome water. Thus, the earth-ox is fashioned to dispel the cold *qi* and prevent the yin *qi* from harming the coming year.\n\nThese seventy-two seasonal indicators each bear their own significance. Gazing upon the scene stirs reflection, allowing one to lodge laments for the times and the movements of creatures—hence they are recorded here in detail.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"The divisions, solstices, commencements, and closures must be recorded along with the clouds and phenomena as a precaution.\" The *divisions* refer to the spring and autumn equinoxes; the *solstices*, to the summer and winter solstices; the *commencements*, to the beginnings of spring and summer; and the *closures*, to the beginnings of autumn and winter.\n\nKong Yingda of the Tang remarked: \"The two solstices mark the beginning and end of yin and yang; the two equinoxes, the convergence of yin and yang. These are the greatest of the seasonal nodes.\" Thus, the ancients observed the clouds and phenomena at the two solstices and two equinoxes. *Phenomena* here refers to color.\n\nThe *Baozhang* official states: \"By discerning the colors of the five clouds and phenomena, one may distinguish good fortune, misfortune, floods, and droughts. The portents of abundance and famine are revealed as follows: green signifies insects, white signifies mourning, red signifies warfare and famine, black signifies floods, and yellow signifies abundance. All are discerned from the colors of the clouds beside the sun, verifying the portents and knowing the twelve phenomena’s corresponding regions. The lands upon which these portents descend will experience abundance or famine.\"\n\nThe *Baozhang* official further states: \"By means of the twelve phenomena, one examines the harmony of heaven and earth. Wind is *qi*.\" In ancient times, the twelve pitch-pipes were blown to gauge the *qi* of the twelve earthly branches, distinguishing omens of good and ill. Today, the method of blowing the pitch-pipes has been lost, and thus its Way has perished.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals* records: When the Chu army attacked Zheng, Music Master Kuang said, \"Five times the song of the north wind was played, and again the song of the south wind. The south wind was weak and full of deathly tones—Chu will achieve nothing.\" My humble observation: Music Master Kuang blew the pitch-pipes to assess Chu’s strength. The north wind corresponds to *wuyi* and *jiazhong* in the north; the south wind, to *guxi*. Since the south wind was weak, he knew Chu would fail.\n\nWang Zhaoyu said: \"The twelve winds arise from the positions of the twelve earthly branches. The six *qi* of heaven and earth combine to generate wind. *Zhen* produces the *ming shu* wind; *li*, the *jing* wind; *dui*, the *yan he* wind; *kan*, the *guang mo* wind—these are the winds of the four cardinal hexagrams. *Gen* produces the *tiao* wind (also called the *tiao* wind at the beginning of spring); *xun*, the *qing ming* wind (also called the *qing ming* wind at the beginning of summer); *kun*, the *dong* wind (also called the *liang* wind at the beginning of autumn); *qian*, the *bu zhou* wind (also called the *bu zhou* wind at the beginning of winter)—these are the winds of the four intercardinal hexagrams. Including the four commencements, the eight hexagrams yield twelve winds.\" The eight winds govern the eight hexagrams.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Dance is used to enact the eight winds.\" It also says: \"The twelve winds correspond to the twelve pitch-pipes.\" On the day of a military campaign, the pitch-pipes are blown to harmonize the sounds. By observing the enemy, one knows good or ill fortune; by hearing the sounds, one predicts victory or defeat. Further details appear in the later discussion on blowing the pitch-pipes.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Heaven and earth are but a single *qi*. At the outset of generation, it is the *qi* of spring. When it grows to excess, it becomes summer; when it contracts, autumn; when it recedes, winter. The next year, it begins again with spring. Benevolence and righteousness are like yin and yang; the four beginnings, like the four seasons. Dividing the four seasons and four beginnings yields the eight nodes. It is but a single *qi* undergoing growth and decline. One divides into two, two into four, three times four into twelve, twice twelve into twenty-four, three times twenty-four into seventy-two. Scattered, they become ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—nothing more than heaven’s three and earth’s two.\"\n\nThe sounds of the pitch-pipes are appended.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *qi* of heaven all rises from within the earth. This *qi*’s ascent and descent should be divided into six. From the first layer below the winter solstice, it begins to generate; by the fourth month, the six yang are complete and begin to wane, while the yin *qi* below begins to arise. The pitch-pipes correspond to the visible signs of the *qi* and seasons. The Grand Music Master oversees the six *lü* and six *tong*. The six *lü* correspond to the yang sounds; the six *tong*, to the yin sounds. The yin and yang of sound each have their correspondences.\"\n\n*Huangzhong* is the *qi* of *zi*, established in the eleventh month, with its celestial branch in *Xingji*. *Dalü* is the *qi* of *chou*, established in the twelfth month, with its celestial branch in *Xuangan*. *Taicou* is the *qi* of *yin*, established in the first month, with its celestial branch in *Yuezi*. *Yingzhong* is the *qi* of *hai*, established in the tenth month, with its celestial branch in *Ximu*.\n\nFor example, *Taicou* governs the *qian* palace, the second yang sound, and is paired with the nine-two of *qian*. The *kun* palace corresponds to *Yingzhong* six-three—these yang *lü* and yin *lü* all take yang as primary, with yin coming to pair with it. The same applies thereafter. Thus, *jiazhong* is established in *mao*; *wuyi*, in *xu*; *guxi* and *nanlü*, in *chen* and *you*, descending through the lodges of *Jiao*, *Dahuo*, *Shouxing*, and *Daliang*, intertwining further.\n\nThe establishment in *si* is *zhonglü*; in *shen*, *yize*; in *wu* and *wei*, *ruibin* and *linzhong*—these are the pipes of the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh months, with their celestial branches in *Shichen*. The stars of *Chunshou* and *Weihuo* intertwine and pair to circulate their *qi*. The stars weave through the twelve lodges, the pitch-pipes correspond to the twelve months, and together they harmonize heaven and humanity. First, the *qi* is distributed within the four seasons to assist the sage-king in positioning heaven and earth, establishing the ultimate of central harmony.\n\nIt is also said: \"The three systems are as follows: establishing *yin* is the human system; establishing *chou*, the earth system; establishing *zi*, the heavenly system. The heavenly system is the *Huangzhong* pitch-pipe, nine inches long, the number of *qian*. The earth system is the *Linzhong* pitch-pipe, six inches long, the number of *kun*. The human system is the *Taicou* pitch-pipe, eight inches long, the number of the eight trigrams. The three pitch-pipes have no remaining fractions. *Linzhong* occupies the *wei* position, where the *qi* of *Huangzhong* is exhausted. At *Linzhong*, the pattern of heaven and earth becomes manifest; by *si* in the southeast, it achieves full expression, with no remaining fractions.\"\n\nThe pitch-pipes take the yin and yang of nine and six as their method. At nine times nine, eighty-one, the system of one epoch is complete and its pattern fully revealed.",

That later ages adopted the Xia calendar as the standard was because human harmony elicits the harmony of heaven and earth in response.\n\nThe Three Palaces are: *Yuanzhong*, the Celestial Palace; *Hanzhong*, the Terrestrial Palace; and *Huangzhong*, the Human Palace. *Yuanzhong* is *Jiazhong*. It arises from the *qi* of the *Fang* and *Xin* constellations, known as the Great Star, the Bright Hall of the Celestial Emperor—hence the Celestial Palace. As a yin tone derived from a yang pitch-pipe, sacrifices to heaven employ four tones, excluding *Huang*, *Cou*, *Gu*, and the like.\n\n*Hanzhong* is *Linzhong*. It arises from the *qi* of *wei*, occupying the *kun* position, where the Celestial Altar and Earthly Spirits reside. Located beyond the *Dongjing* and *Yugui* constellations, it is called the Terrestrial Palace. Sacrifices to earth employ four tones: *Lin*, *Cou*, *Dalü*, *Gu*, and the like.\n\n*Huangzhong* arises from *zi*. Above *zi* lies the *qi* of *Xu* and *Wei*, governing ancestral temples—hence the Human Palace. Sacrifices to ancestral temples employ four tones: *Huang*, *Cou*, *Yingzhong*, *Dalü*, and the like. These three serve as palaces for the sacrificial rites of heaven, earth, and humanity, each generating *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu* tones from their respective palaces, sought through the classification of sounds.\n\nIt is further said: The pitch-pipes and their harmonics await the *qi* without discrepancy. The pitch-pipes are also called *zhong*. *Zhong* means \"center\" and \"resonance.\" Resonance refers to the blowing of ashes. Each pitch-pipe’s bore is nine *fen* in circumference, with an inner diameter of three *fen*. The *Huangzhong* tube is buried at the *zi* position, nine *cun* above the ground, its head facing south. From its orientation and position, all other pitch-pipes can be fully deduced. The ashes are made from the pith of reeds from Henan. The tubes are crafted from bamboo of Jinyang’s Jinmen Mountain.\n\nThe twelve pitch-pipes are buried in a secluded chamber, aligned with the four seasons’ positions: *zi* to *si* and *wu* to *hai* represent the great yin and yang. The six yin and six yang intervals constitute the lesser yin and yang. According to Jing Fang’s twelve pitch-pipes: five pitch-pipes occupy their proper positions, each generating five \"children\"—*Huang*, *Tai*, *Gu*, *Lin*, *Nan*. When yang resides in yang and yin in yin, they occupy their proper positions. Five times five makes twenty-five, plus the original five, totaling thirty.\n\nThose that lose their positions generate three \"children\"—also five pitch-pipes: *Dajia*, *Zhonglü*, *Yize*, *Wu*. When yang resides in yin and yin in yang, they lose their positions. Three times five makes fifteen, plus the original five, totaling twenty. Combining two with three yields fifty positions. Some neither lose nor gain their positions, generating four \"children.\" These reside at the junctures of yin and yang. Two times four makes eight, plus the original two, totaling ten. Ten added to fifty makes sixty.\n\nFurthermore, *Huangzhong*, *Taicou*, and the like—seven pitch-pipes—each govern a day as its palace. The remaining fifty-three pitch-pipes follow the days they generate. Six times seven equals forty-two, which governs the days of one cycle. The twelve pitch-pipes generate twelve modes. According to Jing Fang’s method: one pitch-pipe yields five tones, twelve pitch-pipes yield sixty tones, and sixty pitch-pipes further generate three hundred sixty sounds, corresponding to the days of one year.\n\nAlternatively, taking twelve pitch-pipes, each yields seven tones. Each tone forms one mode, totaling eighty-four modes. Modes serve to harmonize sounds. As the *Huainanzi* states: The three hundred sixty pitch-pipes each take the monthly pitch-pipe as their mother, with one solar term as their child. They follow the established day and celestial stem as their divisions, aligning with the seven tones to determine the established day. The sound of the winter solstice—five tones and seven tones—harmonizes therein. Within it, distinctions between primary and secondary tones exist.\n\nOne pitch-pipe generates five tones. For example, *Huangzhong* belongs to *zi*, and *zi* has five: *jiazi* as *zhi*, *bingzi* as *yu*, *wuzi* as *gong*, *gengzi* as *jiao*, and *renzhi* as *shang*—these are the five tones of *Huangzhong*. *Dalü* likewise has five: *yichou*, *dingchou*, *jichou*, *xinchou*, *guichou*—five tones, following the same pattern. The remaining pitch-pipes, from *mao* to *hai*, are all thus.\n\nMaster Zhu further states: There are twelve pitch-pipes in total, each taking its own pitch-pipe as the *gong* tone and generating four tones. For instance, if *Huangzhong* is *gong*, then *Taicou* is *shang*, *Guxi* is *jiao*, *Linzhong* is *zhi*, and *Nanlü* is *yu*—these are the tones of *Huangzhong*’s one *jun*. If *Linzhong* is *gong*, then *Nanlü* is *shang*, *Yingzhong* is *jiao*, *Dacou* is *zhi*, and *Guxi* is *yu*—these are the tones of *Linzhong*’s one *gong*. Each of the twelve palaces establishes its own *gong* tone and generates four tones, completing the sixty pitch-pipes’ tones.\n\nIt is not that *Huangzhong* is fixed as *gong*, *Taicou* as *shang*, *Guxi* as *jiao*, *Linzhong* as *zhi*, and *Nanlü* as *yu*. Rather, *Huang*, *Tai*, *Dajia*, *Gu*, *Zhonglü*, *Rui*, *Lin*, *Yize*, *Nan*, *Wu*, *Ying*—these form the sequence of the twelve pitch-pipes’ lengths. In *Huangzhong*’s one *jun*, the generation of tones—whether ascending or descending—follows the proper order, so each employs the full pitch-pipe’s primary tone. The remaining sixty pitch-pipes each complete one day’s five tones in sequence. On their respective days, each serves as *gong*, rotating through *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, and *yu*.\n\nMaster Zhu further discusses the method of generating rotating *gong* tones: For example, if *Dalü* is *gong*, it uses *Huangzhong*’s number of eighty-one, reducing it by one-third to generate *Yize* below. *Yize* then uses *Linzhong*’s number of fifty-four, increasing it by one-third to generate *Jiazhong* above. The rest follow this pattern. The numbers of the pitch-pipes and harmonics: *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *mao* belong to yang and generate above, governing growth—hence \"increase by one-third.\" *zi*, *wu*, *si*, and *you* belong to yin and generate below, governing decay—hence \"reduce by one-third.\" Yang generates yin below, long tubes generate short tubes. Reducing by one-third shortens them. Yin generates yang above, short tubes generate long tubes. Increasing by one-third lengthens them. For example, *Huangzhong* is nine *cun*; dividing nine into three parts and combining two yields six *cun*, which is the generation below.",
      "overlap_context": "es long, the number of the eight trigrams. The three pitch-pipes have no remaining fractions. *Linzhong* occupies the *wei* position, where the *qi* of *Huangzhong* is exhausted. At *Linzhong*, the pattern of heaven and earth becomes manifest; by *si* in the southeast, it achieves full expression, with no remaining fractions.\"\n\nThe pitch-pipes take the yin and yang of nine and six as their method. At nine times nine, eighty-one, the system of one epoch is complete and its pattern fully revealed.",

      "translated_text": "The *Linzhong* pipe, corresponding to the sixth month, takes the length of the *Lin* pipe in *cun*, divides it into three parts, and adds two to six to yield eight *cun*, thus generating above. The *Taicu* pipe, corresponding to the first month, follows the same pattern for the remaining pitch-pipes.\n\nCounting by the standard numbers: nine nines are eighty-one, the *gong* tone. Dividing it into three parts and removing one yields twenty-seven, which then becomes fifty-four, the *zhi* tone. Adding eighteen to fifty-four yields seventy-two, the *shang* tone. Within this, removing one part of twenty-four yields forty-eight, the *yu* tone. Adding one part of sixteen to it yields sixty-four, the *jiao* tone. These numbers of the five tones, derived through the method of \"reducing and increasing by one-third,\" all arise naturally.\n\nThe pitch-pipes (*lü*) proceed left while the harmonics (*lü*) proceed right, their courses differing like the method of divination. From *Huangzhong* to *Zhonglü*, all generate below. From *zi* to *si*, yang ascends and yin recedes. Thus, when a pitch-pipe generates a harmonic, it is called \"generating below,\" and when a harmonic generates a pitch-pipe, it is called \"generating above.\" From *Rui Bin* to *Yingzhong*, all generate above. From *wu* to *hai*, yin ascends and yang recedes. Thus, when a pitch-pipe generates a harmonic, it is called \"generating above,\" and when a harmonic generates a pitch-pipe, it is called \"generating below.\" At *wu*, the pattern changes, so *Yi Bin* generates above again. The methods of Jing Fang, Ma Rong, and Zheng Xuan all follow this principle. Ban Gu arranged them in descending order. The *Jiazhong* pipe, at three *cun* and seven *fen* with a fraction, is too short to correspond to the first or second month. As spring embodies the qi of growth and nurturing, Zheng Xuan takes yang’s generation as ascent. But where does descending yang reside? It is better to discuss this through the method of divination: *Qian* (乾), *jia* (甲), and *ren* (壬) proceed left, while *Kun* (坤), *yi* (乙), and *gui* (癸) proceed right. The six yin and six yang follow their courses, and the true nature of *Rui Bin* is the seventh note. Generating above to *Dalü* yields *zhi*, generating below to *Yize* yields *shang*. Generating above to *Jiazhong* yields *yu*, generating below to *Wuyi* yields *jiao*.\n\nUsing the sixty pitch-pipes and sixty hexagrams, from *Huangzhong* proceeding left to *Zhishi* is \"generating above,\" while from *Linzhong* proceeding right to *Chishi* is \"generating below.\" The sixty hexagrams: *Qian* is aligned with *zi* and proceeds left, *Kun* is aligned with *wei* and proceeds right, *Zhun* is aligned with *chou* and the *wenshi* interval and proceeds left, *Meng* is aligned with *yin* and the *wenshi* interval and proceeds right, *Tai* is aligned with *yin* and proceeds left, *Pi* is aligned with *shen* and proceeds right, and *Xiaoguo* is aligned with *wei* and proceeds right. Seven hexagrams proceed in alternating directions, and the pitch-pipes empirically validate this. For a quicker method, one need not look beyond *Qian* and *Kun*, the six yang and six yin. *Zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu*—*Huang*, *Tai*, *Gu*, *Mo*, *Yi*, and *Wu*—follow *Qian*’s leftward rotation, which is called \"pitch-pipes generating below.\" *Wei*, *si*, *mao*, *chou*, *hai*, and *you*—*Lin*, *Zhong*, *Jia*, *Da*, *Ying*, and *Nan*—follow *Kun*’s rightward turn, which is called \"harmonics generating above.\" These are the words of Zheng Xuan’s divination method, derived from the *Tai Xuan*.\n\nJing Fang’s method holds that one pitch-pipe contains the variations of the five tones, forming sixty hexagrams, which actually begin with *Zhong Fu*. After seven days, it returns to correspond with the pitch-pipe of the winter solstice, *Huangzhong*. Its true origin lies in *Zhishi*, which precedes the winter solstice—this is the origin of the pitch-pipe and calendar systems. Yang Xiong and Fang Shi understood this. The Northern Asterism does not move, serving as the pivot of the celestial axis. Yet the true immovable point lies at the final degree of the pivot star.

      "translated_text": "\"Huangzhong is the first, Linzhong the second, Taicu the third, Nanlü the fourth, Guxi the fifth, Yingzhong the sixth, Ruibin the seventh, Dalü the eighth, Yize the ninth, Jiazhong the tenth, Wuyi the eleventh, and Zhonglü the twelfth *gong*. Thus, yang descends to generate yin, and yin ascends to generate yang, culminating in Zhonglü, where the twelve pitch-pipes complete their cycle. Ascending generates Huangzhong as *zhi*, descending generates Linzhong as *shang*. Ascending generates Taicu as *yu*, descending generates Nanlü as *jiao*. These twelve *gong* each possess five tones, totaling sixty tones. Nanlü occupies the final position, hence it is said: 'culminating in Nanlü.' It is also said: 'Zhonglü ascends to generate Zhishi, Zhishi descends to generate Qumie. Ascending and descending generate one another, culminating in Nanshi.' Nanshi is Nanlü. Thus it is said: 'culminating in Nanshi, where the sixty pitch-pipes complete their cycle.'\n\nThe Three Powers and Seven Beginnings: The Three Powers begin with Huangzhong for Heaven, Linzhong for Earth, and Taicu for Man. The Seven Beginnings are Guxi for the beginning of spring, Ruibin for summer, Nanlü for autumn, and Yingzhong for winter—these are the Four Beginnings, which together with the Three make Seven. If one uses the two transpositions to adjust the melody, the sounds of winter and summer will be lacking, and the four seasons incomplete. Therefore, each *gong* has five modes, with the addition of the transposed *gong* and transposed *zhi*—two modes—making seven.\n\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* records only the five tones, without mentioning the transpositions of *gong* and *zhi*. The six yang lines of *Qian* generate the six yang pitch-pipes: *Qian*’s initial nine is Huangzhong as *Fu*, the second nine is Dalü as *Lin*, the third nine is Taicu as *Tai*, the fourth nine is Jiazhong as *Zhuang*, the fifth nine is Guxi as *Da You*, and the top nine is Zhonglü as *Qian*. From Huangzhong, the first yang arises in the eleventh month, and the descent of yang generates yin as 'descending generation.' The six yin lines of *Kun* generate the six yin pitch-pipes: *Kun*’s initial six is Ruibin as *Shen*, the second six is Linzhong as *Dun*, the third six is Yize as *Pi*, the fourth six is Nanlü as *Guan*, the fifth six is Wuyi as *Bo*, and the top six is Yingzhong as *Kun*. From Ruibin, the first yin arises in the fifth month, and the descent of yin generates yang, also termed 'descending generation,' though it may also be called 'ascending generation.'\n\nEight eights correspond to the eight winds; same positions represent husband and wife, different positions represent mother and child. Thus it is said: 'The pitch-pipe takes a wife, and the mother gives birth to a child.' The twelve pipes generate one another, all following the pattern of eight eights. Ascending and descending generation exhausts itself in Zhonglü. The mutual generation of yin and yang begins with Huangzhong and proceeds leftward. For example, Huangzhong generates Linzhong, passing through eight celestial stems. This pattern applies to all subsequent generations, all following the method of 'three heavens and two earths.' Three threes make nine, two threes make six. Nine and six embody the Dao of yin and yang, husband and wife, mother and child.\n\nHuangzhong’s initial nine and Linzhong’s initial six both occupy the first position of the first image. Husband and wife are one body, sharing the same position, and together reside in Linzhong, which ascends to generate Taicu. The second nine, second in the first position, represents mother and child generating one another in different positions. Thus it is said: 'What the pitch-pipe generates are husband and wife in the same position; what the *lü* generates are mother and child in different positions.'\n\nBlowing the pitch-pipes reveals matters of good and ill fortune. The Grand Master holds the unison pitch-pipe to listen to the sounds of the army and proclaim good or ill fortune. In the records of King Wu’s military campaigns, it is said: on the day the king led his troops into battle, the soldiers arrayed their ranks, the generals raised their banners, and the Grand Master blew the pitch-pipes to harmonize the sounds. If *shang* prevailed, the battle was won, and the soldiers were strong—this pertains to the west, where metal governs firm decisiveness, hence strength. If *jiao* prevailed, the army was disordered, with many changes and loss of the soldiers’ morale—wood governs bending and straightening, hence disorder. If *gong* prevailed, the army was harmonious, and the soldiers were of one mind—earth governs growth and nurturing, hence harmony. If *zhi* prevailed, the general was hasty and prone to anger—fire governs fierceness and wrath, hence haste. If *yu* prevailed, the troops were weak, lacking awe and clarity—water governs softness and weakness, hence obscurity.\n\nMaster Kuang said: 'I sang the *North Wind*, then sang the *South Wind*. The *South Wind* was not strong, and many died—Chu also achieved nothing.' The *North Wind* refers to Jiazhong and Wuyi to the north; the *South Wind* refers to Guxi and Nanlü to the south. The qi of the southern pitch-pipes did not arrive, hence many deaths—all were discerned by blowing the pitch-pipes and singing the winds. Sound emitted is called song.\n\nMaster Shao said: 'Primal wine is bland and flavorless; grand sound is pure and rare.' At the winter solstice, the first yang sprouts in Huang*gong*, like the brewing of primal wine. Its flavor is hidden in tastelessness—this is the music of no sound. Master Zhou said: 'Music is pure and not excessive.' Purity calms desire, harmony releases restlessness. This is the central sound of Huangzhong, the root of the pitch-pipes, which naturally sighs without *gong* or *shang*.\n\nI once admired Wan Baochang, who, while dining with others, struck a miscellaneous jar with his chopsticks and spontaneously produced musical tones. The gradations of high and low were exquisite—it was only regrettable that no one at the time understood. Su Shi said: 'If the world had no Master Nan Guo, ears would never have heard the earth’s breath—how much less the breath of heaven?' Ouyang Xiu said: 'Instruments may decay, but sound cannot be transmitted through words.' Alas! Sound—can it truly be without transmission? Within the universe, where can one go that is not governed by tone and pitch? They constantly move with the sun and moon, cold and heat, darkness and light, wind and rain, traversing between heaven and earth. From ancient times to the present, from dawn to dusk, the clamor of voices and the resonance of apertures—all are my lofty mountains and flowing waters, my yellow reed pipes and clay drums. Must one await the performance of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo before sound is deemed transmissible?\n\nIt is also said: 'The *lü* resonates with the *lü* to generate sound.' Sound is *lü*, and *lü* is yang. The *lü* has opening and closing; with each opening and closing, myriad sounds arise. Ten sounds correspond to ten pitch-pipes. The ten celestial stems—five are yang, and the five tones are the conjunction of the ten stems. Thus, in the hexagrams, they correspond to *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*; in time, to the primal epoch, kalpa, cycle, and generation; in the pitch-pipes, to the sounds of the sun, moon, and stars.\"",

      "translated_text": "Voices intone tones, and pitch-pipes intone *lü*. Their reckoning distinguishes the Greater Yang, Lesser Yang, Greater Rigidity, and Lesser Rigidity. Sound arises from the sun, corresponding to *jia* through *gui*, and initiates the twelve tones below on earth. Of the one hundred sixty sounds, one hundred twelve are employed.\n\n*Lü* resonates with *lü* to generate tone. Tone is *lü*, and *lü* is yin. *Lü* has call and response; with each call and response, myriad tones arise. The twelve tones correspond to the twelve *lü*. Of the twelve earthly branches, six are yin, comprising the six *lü*, which are the conjunction of the twelve cyclical signs. Thus, in the hexagrams, they correspond to *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun*; in time, to the year, month, day, and cyclical hour; in *lü*, to the sounds of water, fire, earth, and stone.\n\nTones harmonize sounds, and *lü* harmonize pitch-pipes. Their reckoning distinguishes the Greater Softness, Lesser Softness, Greater Yin, and Lesser Yin. Tone arises from the cyclical hour, corresponding to *yin* through *chou*, and responds above with ten sounds to heaven. Of the one hundred ninety-two tones, one hundred fifty-two are employed.\n\nMaster Shao’s *lü-lü* system reveals the untransmitted secrets of the Primordial, differing from the *Tai Xuan* and *Tai Chu*. The *Xuan* takes heaven’s three odd numbers as its measure. Three multiplied by three yields nine, forming the three sequences of heaven, earth, and humanity. All commence with the *huangzhong* pitch-pipe, following Fan’s reckoning. Master Shao’s *Jingshi Lü-Lü* takes earth’s four even numbers as its measure. Four multiplied by four yields sixteen, arising from the Two Modes generating the Four Images, following the reckoning of the *Yi*. It divides sound and *lü-lü* by the old and young of yin and yang. Four serves as the body, five and six as function. Five is sound, and six is *lü-lü*. If within the body one distinguishes body and function, then sound is the body, and tone is function. If within function one distinguishes body and function, then *lü-lü* is the body, and sound and tone are function.\n\nThe *Tai Xuan* and *Tai Chu* exclusively take *zi* through *si* as yang pitch-pipes and *wu* through *hai* as yin *lü*. Sound and tone merge into one. Master Shao’s Primordial reckoning exclusively takes the ten celestial stems as yang pitch-pipes and the twelve earthly branches as yin *lü*. Sound and tone correspond to *lü-lü* only when one comprehends the method of three multiplied by three and four multiplied by four, after which the study of *lü-lü* may be mastered. Those who have discoursed on sound from ancient times to the present have conflated them into one path. Only with Master Shao’s teachings does precision emerge.\n\nThose skilled in bell and pitch-pipe discern order and chaos by examining sound. When Kangjie traveled to Longmen Mountain, he rested in a grove of gravel, where a withered branch suddenly fell nearby. He said to Fu Han’gong, “This tree will soon be felled.” On his return journey, he saw the land as far as the eye could reach had been cleared. Upon verification, it was discovered that the capital’s construction had felled it, and his words were confirmed. Other examples, such as the prosperity and decline of peonies or the cuckoo’s call foretelling order and chaos, all belong to the same study. Here, I record a few instances below.\n\nDuring the Han, Cai Yong, styled Bojie, passed through Gaoqian Pavilion in Kuaiji and saw the bamboo eaves of its roof. Sixteen stalks from the eastern side could be made into flutes. Indeed, they produced an extraordinary sound, and the world called them “Keting Flutes.” This is knowing sound by form. He also took scorched paulownia from a traveler’s lodge to fashion the “Jiaowei Zither.” This is knowing sound by movement. A neighbor played the zither, and he observed a mantis stalking a cicada. Listening to the sound, he knew it contained a killing intent. This is knowing a person’s heart by the sound of things.\n\nDuring the Sui, Wan Baochang was profoundly versed in music and told Emperor Wen, “The music established by Zheng Yi is the sound of a fallen state—how could it befit Your Majesty’s ears?” He also once listened to the music performed by the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and wept profusely. When asked why, he did not reply.",

      "translated_text": "He said: “The music is lewd and fierce, and it bodes mourning for the realm—before long, there will be mutual slaughter.” At the time, the four seas were in full prosperity, and those who heard this all deemed it unlikely. Yet by the end of the Daye era, his words proved true.\n\nThere was a man named Wang Lingyan who, overhearing his son playing the pipa outside the door and performing the tune *Fan Angongzi*, was greatly startled. He asked, “When did this melody first arise?” The son replied, “It has appeared recently.” Lingyan wept and said to his son, “You must not accompany the Emperor on his journey to Jiangdu—the Emperor will never return.” He explained, “This tune is in the *guan* mode, signifying departure without return. That is how I know.” And so it came to pass.\n\nDuring the Tang, Li Sizhen, listening to music, remarked, “The *gong* mode does not summon the *shang*—this betrays a rift between ruler and minister. The *jue* and *zhi* modes are in discord—this foretells estrangement between father and son. The prevalence of deathly, mournful tones suggests that if the state remains at peace, the Crown Prince will bear the blame.” Soon after, the Crown Prince was deposed. Li Sizhen also divined the day of his own death, prepared his coffin and burial clothes, and died as predicted.\n\nIn the first month of the first year of the Shenlong era, Pei Zhigu was present when the ancestral temple music commenced. He said to Yuan Xingchong, “The harmony of bells and chimes is exquisite—does this not portend great fortune for the Tang imperial line?” That very month, Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne.\n\nThere was a man who, upon hearing a horse neigh, declared, “The horse’s cry is mournful—its master will surely fall to his death.” Another, hearing the jingling of a bride’s girdle ornaments, said, “This will end in separation.” Upon inquiry, all such predictions proved accurate. Similarly, Zheng Xiangru’s counsel to Zheng Qian foretold glory and disgrace, success and failure, life and death.\n\nSong Shaochangbo Dou Gongyan could calculate the decay of wooden pillars and accurately foretell the lifespans and fortunes of brothers. Dou Wan was deeply versed in musical temperament; his discernment of sounds allowed him to make such predictions. From this, one may infer that those skilled in divination and prognostication have been numerous since the Qin and Han dynasties, yet only the Song Confucian Master Kangjie attained its subtleties.\n\nHe held that human nature is quiescent, and that extreme stillness gives rise to movement. This movement is yang, not emotion. It is the first manifestation of the heart of Heaven and Earth at the dawn of creation. When a person lies in the womb, it is a time of creation, the initial yang. At birth, the moment of “opening things and accomplishing affairs,” emotion first stirs, and movement becomes visible.\n\nHe arranged two hundred fifty-six positions, calculating from sound. Master Kangjie used two hundred sixty-four characters to encompass the numerical system of *lü* and *lü* tones. Within this, one hundred twelve characters summarized *sheng* (sound), while one hundred fifty-two summarized *yin* (tone). Sound and tone mutually interact through fanqie, yielding seventeen thousand twenty-four distinct sounds. Sound corresponds to rhyme, tone to initials. Sounds are divided into level, rising, departing, and entering tones, while tones are categorized by labial, lingual, dental, molar, and guttural articulation. Sounds distinguish inner and outer, and tones are further refined through eight transformations: opening, developing, gathering, and closing. They are also divided into *pi* (expansion), *qing* (clear), *xi* (contraction), and *zhuo* (turbid). Sounds are represented by trigrams on the left, tones by trigrams on the right. The outer three lines of a hexagram are called *hui* (regret), the inner three *zhen* (constancy). Viewed horizontally, each yields a specific hexagram—these two hexagrams together form *jiji* (already completed), the diagrammatic hexagram. By identifying the hexagram in the *guai* diagram, one determines fortune or misfortune, all calculated from sound. Listening must be precise, without the slightest error.\n\nMaster Yichuan said: “One expansion and one contraction encompass the level, rising, departing, and entering tones. One intonation and one response encompass opening, developing, gathering, and closing. When the level, rising, departing, and entering tones are complete, ten thousand sounds arise. When opening, developing, gathering, and closing are complete, ten thousand tones arise. The *lü* follow Heaven and change; the *lü* follow Earth and transform. Expansion follows yang and emerges; contraction follows yin and withdraws. Intonation follows the firm and ascends; response follows the yielding and descends. Only then do the *lü* and *lü* align with sound, and the Dao of *gong*, *zhi*, *yu*, *jue*, and *shang* each attain their proper place.\n\nYang is the sun, fire; yin is the moon, water. The firm is metal, the stars; the yielding is earth, the celestial stems. When the sun, moon, stars, celestial stems, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are in harmony, Heaven and Earth are rectified. The sun is the eye, fire, color; the moon is the ear, water, sound; the stars are the nose, metal, qi; the celestial stems are the tongue, earth, taste. When the eye, ear, mouth, and nose—color, sound, qi, and taste—are rectified, the human Dao is rectified. Thus, to understand the Dao of *lü*, *lü*, and sound is to be able to conduct the affairs of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. The mutual resonance of *lü* and *lü* gives rise to sound, through which the emotions of Heaven, Earth, and all things are revealed.” Thus concludes the tenth scroll of *Tian Yuan Fa Wei*.",

      "translated_text": "The Hexagram-Qi System\n\nThe hexagram-qi system originates with *Zhong Fu* (Hexagram of Inner Truth). Jing Fang transmitted it from Jiao Gan, who received it from a recluse. It states that the four cardinal hexagrams govern the four directions, serving as regional overseers. The hexagrams *Kan* (Water), *Li* (Fire), *Zhen* (Thunder), and *Dui* (Lake) correspond to the solstices and equinoxes—days when the qi of the four seasons holds sway: wood in spring, fire in summer, metal in autumn, and water in winter. Each hexagram governs its season, and divination on its designated day reveals auspicious or inauspicious omens. The remaining sixty-four hexagrams and their lines each govern a single day, totaling three hundred and sixty days. The remaining five and a quarter days are divided into eighty parts per day, beginning at midnight, so that five days comprise four hundred parts, and the quarter-day is further divided into twenty parts. The sixty hexagrams are apportioned such that forty-two hexagrams each receive seven parts. The *Bo* hexagram (Stripping), where yang qi is exhausted, falls at the end of the ninth month, and the tenth month is governed solely by *Kun* (Earth). *Kun* spans six days and seven parts; when *Kun* is exhausted, the *Fu* hexagram (Return) brings the return of yang qi. From the exhaustion of *Bo* to the return of yang in *Fu*, *Kun* intervenes with six days and seven parts. Rounded to whole numbers, this is referred to as \"seven days.\" In my humble opinion, when speaking of monthly hexagrams, *Bo* to *Fu* spans *Kun*; when speaking of seasonal hexagrams, each month contains five hexagrams. The above is recorded in the *Yi Wei Tu* (Diagrams of the *Weft* Texts of the *Book of Changes*).\n\nJing Fang’s transmission designates the waxing and waning hexagrams as rulers: waxing hexagrams are called *Tai Yin* (Great Yin), waning hexagrams *Tai Yang* (Great Yang), and the rest are termed *Shao Yin* (Lesser Yin) and *Shao Yang* (Lesser Yang). Cai Shi of Xishan remarked: Shao Yong also employed the six-day-seven-part system, and Yang Xiong adapted it to compose the *Tai Xuan* (Supreme Mystery). The *Tai Xuan* omits *Kan*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*, while the *Jing Shi* (Sovereign Generations) omits *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Both exclude the four cardinal hexagrams, adhering to the sixty-hexagram, six-day-seven-part system. Zixia said: \"When the six positions are exhausted, they revert to *Fu* within *Kun*; the number is seven.\" The seventh line begins at the first position, hence the term \"seven days.\" Hu Anding stated: Traversing six lines, each line represents a day, so the sixty hexagrams and their lines correspond to three hundred and sixty days. The interval between any two hexagrams is seven days. Moreover, some hexagrams take a line as a year, others as a month, and others as a day. The phrase \"seven days\" clarifies the hexagram-qi system. In terms of waxing and waning, from the *Li Dong* (Beginning of Winter) solar term in the tenth month to the *Da Xue* (Great Snow) solar term in the eleventh month, *Kun* transitions to *Fu*, spanning nearly seven days. The explanations of all scholars trace back to Zixia. The Confucians of the two Han dynasties transmitted the Classics using the six-day-seven-part system. By the Song dynasty, Wang Zhaosu, Wang Kui, and Song Xian began to write treatises refuting it.\n\nZhaosu argued: The commentaries and sub-commentaries both contradict the Master’s meaning. Even in the tenth month, when *Kun* is pure, yang qi still resides within. Thus, the *Qimai* (Millet) Master’s *Kun* hexagram’s top line speaks of \"dragons battling.\" If *Kun* were exhausted after six days and seven parts, then at the end of the tenth month, a single yang would immediately occupy its position, leaving fifteen days until the winter solstice. This demonstrates the difficulty of applying the seven-day principle to the numerical system of the *Yi Wei*. Hu Dan challenged this, saying: In the Western Han, Jing Fang’s hexagram-qi governance consistently proved accurate. In the Eastern Han, Lang Dian’s six-day-seven-part theory was the most refined. The six-day-seven-part system is the actual count of hexagrams and lines, while the days of the year are a nominal count. The remaining days of the month are calculated and added as intercalary days. Zhaosu failed to grasp the subtlety of intercalation, hence his doubt about the fifteen-day gap before the winter solstice. It is regrettable that the *Weft* texts have been lost, and Jing Fang and Lang Dian’s teachings have perished.\n\nZhu Zifa remarked: Zhaosu only understood the general outline. How could he comprehend that the four cardinal hexagrams govern the four directions, while the sixty hexagrams govern the days of a full year? The solar terms are all regulated by the four cardinal hexagrams, leaving five days and a quarter, which accumulate to form intercalary days. Each hexagram spans six days and seven parts, with the advance and retreat of qi propelling the cycle. For example, in the ninth month, *Bo* is followed by *Gen* (Mountain), *Ji Ji* (After Completion), *Shi He* (Biting Through), and *Da Guo* (Great Exceeding), totaling five hexagrams before *Kun* is complete. In the tenth month, *Wei Ji* (Before Completion), *Jian* (Obstruction), *Yi* (Nourishment), and *Zhong Fu* (Inner Truth) precede *Fu*, again five hexagrams. Thirty days separate *Bo* and *Fu*, with *Fu* governing the winter solstice. The mid-point qi of the winter solstice begins with *Zhong Fu*, and seven days after *Zhong Fu*, *Fu* arrives. Thus it is said: \"This is the movement of Heaven.\" Among the scholars of past dynasties, only the *Xuan* (Mystery) grasped its essence. Hence: *Xuan* is one, *Zhong* (Center) is two, *Xian* (Surplus) is three, *Cong* (Compliance) is four, *Geng* (Renewal) is five, *Mou* (Gaze) is six, *Kuo* (Vastness) is seven, *Han* (Shout) is eight, *Chen* (Submersion) is nine, forming the central image.\n\n*Zhong Fu* corresponds to the winter solstice solar term, when the sun rises at one degree of the *Niu* (Ox) constellation, and the Dipper points to *Zi* (North). The pitch-standard *Huang Zhong* (Yellow Bell) governs the eleventh month of the Xia calendar. The Zhou dynasty entered the *Niu* constellation at five degrees. The Zhou symbol *seven-five-one-return* (七五一复) signifies the seven-day return of yang qi. From Yang Xiong, Ma Rong, Zheng Xuan, Song, Yu, Lu, and Fan, all transmitted this learning, yet Zhaosu opposed it—what could be done? Wang Kui had already refuted Kong Yingda’s interpretation of Wang Bi’s commentary, and Song Xian further denounced Jing Fang, Lang Dian, and Guan Lang for appropriating the *Book of Changes* to practice *Ren Dun* (Six Ren), divination, incantations, and yin-yang numerology, which deviate from the Sage’s intent. Why not simply assign each hexagram to a month and each line to a day? Why does the qi not arise from other hexagrams but uniquely from *Zhong Fu*?\n\nZhu Shi countered: Kong Yingda and Wang Bi’s *Yi Wei* waxing-and-waning hexagrams cannot be dismissed. *Liu Ren* (Six Ren) divination aligns times and days with the *Kan* and *Li* hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*. *Dun Jia* (Hidden Jia) divides the nine palaces according to the *He Tu* (Yellow River Diagram), both capturing one aspect of the *Book of Changes* but not its entirety. He further argued: Scholars who invoke *Ren Dun* to explain the *Book of Changes* seek to encompass all under heaven, unaware that *Ren Dun* actually derives from the *Book of Changes*. Why, then, should those who expound the *Book of Changes* rely on *Ren Dun*?",

      "translated_text": "The sage deduced the principles of yin-yang waxing and waning to illuminate the images of gain and loss, survival and demise. Those who trust in the advance and retreat of hardness and softness yet reject the *Xiao Xi* (Waxing and Waning) learning of the *Yi Wei* (Apocrypha of the *Book of Changes*), claiming that hexagram qi does not arise from *Zhong Fu*, are like those who count all day yet know not of two and five—how can they be deemed skilled at reading books?\n\nOn the winter solstice of the *yimao* year in the *Yuanzhen* reign (1295), Master Fang of Xugu sent me a letter, stating: \"Zhu Zifa posits that the winter solstice begins at the first degree of *Niu* (Ox) Mansion—this is an ancient method. In the third year of Emperor Wen of Han (177 BCE), the winter solstice fell on the twenty-second degree of *Niu*. By the first year of the *Xingyuan* reign of Tang (784 CE), it had shifted to the ninth degree of *Dou* (Dipper). Over 961 years, it regressed twelve degrees. Now, in the first year of *Yuanzhen* (1295), on the seventh day of the eleventh month, the winter solstice falls on the eighth degree of *Ji* (Winnowing Basket), having regressed another twelve degrees. Five days after the solstice, it lies at the third degree of *Dou*. How can one still cling to the old saying that the winter solstice enters *Niu* Mansion to symbolize the return of the Zhou?\"\n\nI replied: \"Examining antiquity, it is difficult to find complete uniformity. The *Calendar* states that in the time of Yao, the winter solstice fell on the first degree of *Xu* (Emptiness), yet He Chengtian claimed it was on the tenth degree of *Nü* (Woman). The *Yuangai Calendar* of the Song placed the solstice at the seventeenth degree of *Dou*, while the *Monthly Ordinances Essential Meaning* placed it at the fourteenth degree. The *Dayan Calendar* of the Tang’s *Kaiyuan* era set it at the tenth degree of *Dou*, and by the Song’s *Tongyuan Calendar*, it had shifted to the second degree. Moreover, ancient calendars marked the start of the day at midnight, yet Cui Zhongrong took the beginning of *zi* (midnight) as the start of the month, resulting in a two-*ke* discrepancy—yet even then, his precision was acknowledged.\n\nFor yin and yang qi, uneven and irregular, surge and recede to form a year. Their expansion and contraction, advance and retreat, naturally follow this pattern, shifting only within the bounds of *Ji*, *Dou*, *Niu*, and *Nü*. The *Tai Xuan*’s claim that entering *Niu* Mansion symbolizes return derives from the *Tai Chu* calendar. It speaks of what was empirically validated at the time, approximating the general reckoning as a standard. Though later developments diverged, their foundation remains the same—I dare not dismiss them lightly.\"\n\nZhu Xi said: \"A skilled calendar-maker must establish broad, flexible parameters to encompass all—this is indeed correct.\" As for the theory of \"six days and seven fen,\" the various scholars have debated it thoroughly—what need is there to belabor it further?\n\nThe *Xiang* (Image) of *Ge* (Revolution) states: \"Fire within the marsh—*Ge*. The noble person, in accordance with this, regulates the calendar and clarifies the seasons.\" Zhu Zifa said: \"The winter solstice begins at the first degree of *Qianniu* (Ox Leader), proceeding rightward through the twelve stations, completing at the twenty-sixth degree of *Dou*, then returning to the first degree of *Qianniu*—thus the calendar is renewed. *Qianniu* is the fire position, *Xingji* (Star Marker) the water position; the sun and moon conjoin here, forming the image of fire within the marsh. This is the origin of the *Tai Chu* calendar’s epoch, corresponding in hexagram qi to the third month. The *Tai Xuan* aligns with this, renewing the historian’s daily reckoning. It occupies the forty-ninth position in the sequence of hexagrams, matching the nodal point of the *Tai Yan* (Great Expansion) number, and the sixtieth, aligning with the degrees of the celestial circuit.\n\nThe sixty hexagrams and 360 lines, each line governing a day. The upper canon begins with *Qian* at *jiazi*, *Tai* at *jiaxu*, *Shi* at *jiashen*, and concludes at *Li*, thirty hexagrams encompassing 180 days, exhausting the three *jia*. The lower canon begins with *Xian* at *jiawu*, *Sun* at *jiachen*, *Zhen* at *jiayin*, and ends at *Jie* at *guihai*, likewise thirty hexagrams spanning 180 days to complete a year. Thus, Jing and Jiao used them to determine daily nodes, calling them 'heaven-and-earth nodes.' The four seasons achieve revolution—this is also called 'heaven-and-earth revolution.' The four seasons are thus established, or unified in a single Dao of nodal division.\n\nThe subsequent hexagrams—*Zhong Fu*, *Xiao Guo*, and *Ji Ji*—serve to divide the *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* hexagrams, corresponding to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, representing spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Doubling the four seasons yields the eight nodes, marking the solstices, equinoxes, and the beginnings and closings of the seasons. Each line governs fifteen days, aligning with the seventy-two seasonal markers.\n\nFormer scholars claimed that hexagrams begin with *Zhong Fu*—this is incorrect. *Zhong Fu* begins at *jiazi*. *Qian* in the eleventh month starts at *jiazi*, with yang qi culminating at *si* and ending its node. Ten hexagrams yield *guihai* in the tenth month—here, yin is born at *wu*, culminating at *hai* to conclude the reckoning of a year.\n\nNow, it is also said that *Zhong Fu* corresponds to the eleventh month, beginning at *jiazi* and concluding at *Wei Ji*—this is because hexagram qi all arise from the mid-month qi of the preceding month. The *Tai Xuan* aligns *Zhong Fu* with the initial six of *Kan*, corresponding to the eleventh month. The mid-month qi begins to stir, resonating with the *Shang Yuan* (Upper Origin). The *Tai Chu* calendar takes the new moon and winter solstice of the eleventh month as the origin of reckoning, the head of calendar computation.\n\n*Zhong Fu* (upper *Xun*, lower *Dui*), *Xiao Guo* (upper *Zhen*, lower *Gen*), and *Ji Ji* (embodying the forms of *Kan* and *Li*) constitute the six children. The qi of lesser yang and lesser yin, the six children, distribute across the four seasons to complete a year’s seasonal markers.\"\n\nShaozi said: \"Luo Xiahong reformed the *Zhuan* calendar into the *Tai Chu* calendar, and Yang Xiong modeled the *Tai Xuan* upon the *Tai Chu* calendar. Every sixth hexagram, qi arises from the center. Thus, the first hexagram combines three celestial and two terrestrial numbers—though not the true celestial and terrestrial numbers, it approximates them.\n\nKangjie said: \"Does the *Tai Xuan* not grasp the heart of heaven and earth? The heart is where *Kun*’s extremity generates *Qian*, beginning at the time of the winter solstice—this is the origin of pitch standards and calendars. Its profound and far-reaching insights harmonize with the divine to this extent.\" Thus, his poem reads: \"Were it not for Yangzi’s learning of heaven and man, how could there be Zhuangzi’s inner and outer chapters?\"\n\nWhen the first yang stirs and the myriad things are yet unborn, the sage perceives the heart of heaven and earth in this. Hexagrams begin with *Zhong Fu*, responding in seven days. Its central emptiness images the heart, resonating with the Han *Tai Chu* calendar.",

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuan Emperor’s Calendar* takes the tenth month as its beginning, while the *Lianshan* Classic begins with *Gen*. Ziyun’s *Tai Xuan* comprises eighty-one chapters, each with nine eulogies, totaling seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies. These eulogies are the *yao*. Two eulogies correspond to one day, each eulogy governing six hours; one hour yields six *ce*, so one eulogy yields thirty-six *ce*, aligning with the *yao* of the sixty hexagrams’ qi. Each hexagram spans six and seven-sevenths days, while each *Tai Xuan* chapter spans four and a half days. One chapter of four and a half days leaves a remainder, but two chapters of nine days balance evenly. Yin chapters take yin numbers as their basis, while yang chapters take yang numbers. The number five resides between two and four—five is earth. One, two, three, and four, the generating numbers, precede five; six, seven, eight, and nine, the completing numbers, follow it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"*Tai Xuan* entirely follows Jiao Yanshou’s method of deriving hexagram qi.\" The explanations of Jiao’s school differ. In King Wen’s eight trigrams, *Qian* lies in the northwest, with twelve hexagrams in the southeast; *Kun* lies in the southwest, with twelve hexagrams in the northwest—their positions are entirely distinct. The *Yi*’s trigrams—*Zhen* in the east, *Dui* in the west, *Li* in the south, and *Kan* in the north—form one system, while the twelve sovereign hexagrams assigned to the twelve earthly branches form another. When Jiao Yanshou devised his method of hexagram qi governing days, he merged the two into one. He not only used the eight trigrams’ *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui*—with their twenty-four *yao* governing days and hours—but also assigned the twelve sovereign hexagrams to the twelve months. Further dividing them into forty-eight hexagrams, corresponding to dukes, marquises, ministers, and grandees, the theory of \"six days and seven parts\" emerged. *Tai Xuan* models itself on hexagram qi, taking *Zhong Fu* as the beginning of the winter solstice and *Yi*’s top *yao* as the end of *Da Xue*. *Tai Xuan* also takes the center as the inception of yang qi, the start of the winter solstice. *Yang* contains the two eulogies *Qi* and *Ying*, marking the end of *Da Xue*. All follow the sequence of the *Yi*’s hexagram qi but alter their names. Hexagram qi employs *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* to govern the twenty-four qi. *Tai Xuan*, however, begins with the center, multiplies by four and then six, to govern the twenty-four qi. In its selection of numbers, it fundamentally follows the *River Chart*: one and six share a lineage, two and seven form a fellowship, three and eight become companions, four and nine follow the same path, and five and ten guard one another—thus uniting the generating and completing numbers.

      "translated_text": "The might of halberds and spears derives from four and nine; the system of ruler and minister, from two and seven; the sacrifices to spirits and gods, from one and six; the nourishment of wine and food, from five and five—yet five is unspoken, for five times five makes ten.\n\nIt is further said: Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan* is entirely modeled on the *Yi*. While the *Yi* employs the number four, he uses the number three throughout. Since he originally imitated the *Yi*, one may glimpse its meaning by examining the very phrases he imitates. Where the *Tai Xuan* aligns with the *Yi*: *Zhou* corresponds to *Fu*, *Tong* to *Meng*, *Zeng* to *Yi*, *Jiao* to *Tai*, and *Yi* to *Yang*. All these names are drawn from the *Yi*’s hexagrams. Sometimes one section matches one hexagram, or two or three sections match a single hexagram—thus clarifying the method of minute divisions.\n\n*Xuan Chong* is the sequence of hexagrams; *Xuan Cuo*, the miscellaneous hexagrams; *Xuan Shu*, the commentary on the hexagrams; *Xuan Wen*, the *Wen Yan*. The *Xi Ci*’s exposition on the *Tui Ying Kang Tu* is its proclamation—all modeled on the *Yi*. The *Yi* begins with one generating two, two generating four, four expanding to eight, and eight times eight yielding sixty-four, where it halts. The *Tai Xuan* begins with one generating three, three generating nine, and nine times nine yielding eighty-one, where it halts. The *Yi* has six lines: metal, wood, water, and fire form one division, the upper line another. Six times six produces sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines. The *Tai Xuan* has nine eulogies, dividing the generation of metal, wood, water, and fire. These become eight, and with earth’s guarding of one, form nine. Nine times nine extends to seven hundred twenty-nine eulogies, where it is complete. Both the *Yi* and the *Tai Xuan* share the same Five Phases.\n\nThe *Yi* multiplies two by four, four by eight, eight by sixty-four, and sixty-four by three hundred eighty-four—rooted in the *River Chart*’s celestial three multiplied by earth’s four. Thus, four is the body of earth, while heaven employs the number three. This is why Fuxi doubled three lines into six to form a hexagram. The numbers of the *Tai Xuan* arise from the pitch of *Huang Zhong*: a nine-inch hollow with a nine-fen circumference. Tripling one yields the Three Powers; tripling heaven’s three yields the Nine Categories; tripling earth’s four yields the twelve sovereign hexagrams; tripling heaven’s five yields the fifteen days of one qi; tripling earth’s six yields the eighteen changes that form a hexagram.\n\n*Huang Zhong* begins at *zi*, heaven’s one. Tripling *zi*’s one yields three at *chou*; tripling *chou*’s three yields nine at *yin*; tripling *yin*’s nine yields twenty-seven at *mao*; tripling *mao*’s twenty-seven yields eighty-one at *chen*; tripling *chen*’s eighty-one yields two hundred forty-three at *si*; tripling *si*’s two hundred forty-three yields seven hundred twenty-nine at *wu*. From *wu* through *wei*, *shen*, *you*, *xu*, and *hai*—the five celestial stems—it reaches one hundred seventy-seven thousand one hundred forty-seven. This is the number of Jing Fang’s sixty pitch-standards, as recorded in the annotations of the *Treatise on Pitch Standards and Calendars* in the Eastern and Western *Han Histories*.\n\nThe *Tai Xuan*’s three hundred sixty-five days, each multiplied by eighty-one, yield twenty-nine thousand five hundred sixty-five parts. Adding one-fourth of a day—twenty parts and a fraction—makes twenty-nine thousand five hundred eighty-five parts and a fraction. Every eulogy and every qi aligns precisely in calculation. Thus it is said: \"Below they drink, above they drink, issuing and entering the nine voids.\" The *Xuan* is the chief of spirits.\n\nIt is also said: Ziyun (Yang Xiong) was a man of deep thought, who would withdraw to ponder. Like the subtleties of yin and yang’s waxing and waning, he simply sought to deduce them. Zhang Heng praised its profound Dao. Its numbers enable one to debate matters of yin and yang—a book of the Han dynasty’s two hundred years, comparable to the Five Classics.\n\nFor example: \"The sun’s path errs; yin and yang alternate in succession. Death and life intertwine; the ten thousand things are thus entangled.\" This speaks of the bright phase’s birth and the dim phase’s death, the dim phase’s death and the bright phase’s birth—death and life passing one to the other, the ten thousand things entwined and accomplished.\n\nOr: \"Examine the patterns of dragon and tiger; observe the principles of tortoise and bird. Establish heaven’s warp as yin and yang; establish earth’s weft as vertical and horizontal; establish human conduct as darkness and light.\" This means heaven is the warp, earth the weft; south and north are the warp, east and west the weft. The division between darkness and light, worthiness and foolishness, lies therein.\n\nOr: \"One day and one night make a full day; one yin and one yang generate the ten thousand things.\" This refers to summer’s sixty *ke* of daylight and winter’s sixty *ke* of night. No night is longer than the winter solstice, no day longer than the summer solstice. The winter solstice’s night does not surpass the summer solstice’s day, hence the day’s count is greater.\n\nOr: \"Nothing generates yang like *zi*; nothing generates yin like *wu*. In the northwest, *zi*’s beauty is exhausted; in the southeast, *wu*’s beauty is exhausted.\" This means yang begins at *zi* and ends at *wu*, yin begins at *wu* and ends at *zi*. The southwest still holds a trace of yang, hence in the northwest its beauty is exhausted. The northeast still holds a trace of yin, hence in the southeast its beauty reaches its peak.\n\nAs for the Way of yang being ever abundant and the Way of yin ever deficient, this means yang is fully employed while yin is half used. \"South and north fix position; east and west circulate qi.\" That *zi* and *wu* fix position refers to the storehouses of yin and yang. When east’s wood flourishes, west’s metal dies—qi responds and communicates.\n\nIn its discussion of the sun and moon, it says: \"The sun has south and north; without south and north, there would be no winter and summer. The moon has going and coming; without going and coming, there would be no new and full moons.\" The sage observes the changes of concealment and exposure, and regulates the sequence of the sun and moon’s male and female.",
      "overlap_context": "four qi. *Tai Xuan*, however, begins with the center, multiplies by four and then six, to govern the twenty-four qi. In its selection of numbers, it fundamentally follows the *River Chart*: one and six share a lineage, two and seven form a fellowship, three and eight become companions, four and nine follow the same path, and five and ten guard one another—thus uniting the generating and completing numbers. To approximate this, the symbols of robes and garments are derived from three and eight...",

      "translated_text": "The sun reaches its southernmost point at *Niu* (Ox) and its northernmost at *Dongjing* (Eastern Well). The south is the Greater Yang; the north is the Greater Yin. When yang essence reaches the Greater Yang, it is summer; when yin essence reaches the Greater Yin, it is winter. At dusk, the moon appears in the west as *tiao* (exposure); at dawn, it appears in the east as *ce ni* (concealment)—the rest is seen in the *Greater Yang* chapter.\n\nIn its discussion of the numbers of yin and yang, it states: *Zi* and *wu* are nine; *chou* and *wei* are eight; *yin* and *shen* are seven; *mao* and *you* are six; *chen* and *xu* are five; *si* and *hai* are four. Thus, the forty-two *lü* and thirty-six *lü* (pitch standards) alternate or not, totaling seventy-eight. *Jia* and *ji* are nine; *yi* and *geng* are eight; *bing* and *xin* are seven; *ding* and *ren* are six; *wu* and *gui* are five. Sound arises from the sun; *lü* arises from the celestial stems. Sound is based on essence and substance; *lü* harmonizes with sound. When sound and *lü* align, the eight tones arise. The Yellow Bell begins at *zi*, as *Qian*’s first yang line starts with nine. *Wu* is the palace of *zi*, hence both are nine. The months from *zi* to *si* correspond to those from *wu* to *hai*. The numbers four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine are divided: *jia* and *ji* pair with *zi* as nine; *yi* and *geng* follow *chou* as eight; *bing* and *xin* follow *yin* as seven; the numbers six and five follow likewise. Yang *lü* are nine, seven, and five, doubled to make forty-two. Yin *lü* are eight, six, and four, doubled to make thirty-six. Combined, they total seventy-eight. At eight, *chou* and *wei* return, obtaining *lü* but not *lü* (pitch standards). The five tones arise from the ten celestial stems: *jia* and *yi* are *jiao* (角); *bing* and *ding* are *zhi* (徵); *geng* and *xin* are *shang* (商); *ren* and *gui* are *yu* (羽). The twelve *lü* arise from the twelve hours, from which they emerge. The eight tones are metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, earth, leather, and wood. This is the source of sound and *lü*, the numbers of the Five Phases. Later generations who cite this to discuss Kangjie’s numbers—how could they know its true origin lies here?\n\nThe profound principle: The numbers of the *Tai Xuan* begin with three. *Tai Xuan* is the Supreme Ultimate. It symbolizes the ruler’s position. The three directions are heaven, earth, and humanity, representing the Three Powers. The *Xuan* of heaven, the *Xuan* of earth, and the *Xuan* of humanity. The three directions symbolize the Three Dukes; each direction has three provinces, totaling nine provinces symbolizing the Nine Ministers. Each province has three departments, totaling seventy-two departments symbolizing the grand masters. Heaven’s Way is established as beginning, middle, and end; earth’s Way as upper, middle, and lower; humanity’s Way as contemplating fortune and misfortune.\n\nThe *Yi* divines through change; the *Xuan* divines through penetration. The opening eulogies of the *Xuan* are all based on the Five Phases. From *zhong* (center) to *zhou* (cycle), reaching *yang* (nourishment): *zhong* is one, water; *zhou* is two, fire; *zan* is three, wood; *xian* is four, metal; *shao* is five, earth; *li* is six, water (earth’s six completes water). *Shang* is seven, fire; *gan* is eight, wood; *shi* is nine, metal. The numbers end at nine. From *xian* onward, it begins again as one, water. This pattern continues thereafter. Each of the nine eulogies in a section: the first is water, the second is fire, the third is wood, the fourth is metal, the fifth is earth, the sixth is water again, the seventh is fire, the eighth is wood, and the ninth is metal. In all sections, five is the ruler. The primary line of a section is like the fifth line in a *Yi* hexagram. In the *Xuan*, the first section begins with yang, corresponding to the first section of yin. The eighty-one sections all correspond to one another. Odd sections are yang; even sections are yin. Odd corresponds to odd; even to even. Their governing principles differ and oppose one another.\n\nThe *Xuan*’s sequence states: \"Patrolling the six *jia*, it meets the Dipper.\" This is the great principle of the *Xuan*’s calendrical origins. The *Xuan* has *qi man* (excess), just as the Dipper has intercalary months. The eighty-one sections begin from the center, and each section must indicate the degree of the sun’s entry at the month’s first day, all governed by the Dipper. For time is easily corrected and visible, while the Dipper’s reckoning is obscure and prone to error. When seasonal qi and the Dipper align without discrepancy, intercalation is correct, and the calendar is accurate.\n\nIt also states: \"The *Tai Xuan* measures the sun by day and the Dipper by night,\" omitting the moon, for it constantly waxes to govern the void. The *Xuan* measures the sun by day and the Dipper’s pointer because they are constant and unchanging. The moon waxes and wanes, its size and speed irregular, hence it is not recorded. The degrees of the twenty-eight lodges in the diagram are not the celestial twenty-eight lodges but the positions of seasonal nodes. The degrees of the sun’s entry at the month’s first day and the *Monthly Ordinances*’ solar entries are broadly similar.\n\nThe *Xuan*’s diagram states: \"From *zi* to *chen*, from *chen* to *shen*, from *shen* to *zi*, crowned with *jia*.\" Chapters, sessions, unities, and elements vanish together with lunar eclipses—this is the *Xuan*’s Way. Wu Ji of Yulin annotates: In the first year of the *Taichu* epoch, the first month was *jiazi*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. After 1,539 years, the first month was *jiachen*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. After another 1,539 years, the first month was *jiashen*, the new moon coincided with the winter solstice, with no remainder. Nineteen years make one *zhang*; twenty-seven *zhang* make 513 years. One *hui* is the completion of the sun and moon’s conjunction. Eighty-one *zhang* make 1,539 years, one *tong*. From *zi* to *chen*, from *chen* to *shen*, totaling 4,617 years make one *yuan*. A *yuan* has three *tong*; a *tong* has three *hui*; a *hui* has twenty-seven *zhang*. Nine *hui* have 243 *zhang*, completing the cycle. Calculating a *yuan*’s numbers with *zhang*, *hui*, and *tong*: when the nine *hui*’s *tong* numbers are exhausted, the cycle ends. One *zhang* exhausts intercalary fractions; one *hui* exhausts lunar eclipses; one *tong* exhausts new moon fractions; one *yuan* exhausts the six *jia*—this is the *Xuan*’s Way.",

      "translated_text": "The *Xuan* begins at the Celestial Origin, at the first dawn of *jiazi*, when the winter solstice commences at the start of *Qianniu*. From a span of eight *cun* to a single step, it moves ceaselessly. It revolves through 365¼ degrees, thirty days make a month, twelve months make a year. Intercalary months are added to fix the four seasons, completing 365¼ days—yet it does not fully circle. The *Zhuan* calendar falls short by ¾ of a day, while the *Tai Chu* calendar falls short by half a day. The reason it does not fully circle is that yang numbers overflow while yin numbers are deficient. Thus, two surplus measures are added to fulfill the *Xuan*’s numbers and align with celestial degrees—just as intercalary months are added to reconcile the year’s days, thereby enacting the pitch pipes and calendrical reckoning.\n\nI deem that Shao Kangjie’s *Jingshi* calendar, though differing from this, proceeds by analogy to achieve divine subtlety. Master Shao’s *Xiantian* hexagram qi: *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, are apportioned to the four seasons, governing the twenty-four qi. When *Kan* completes its course at the *zi* midpoint, it exchanges with *Li*; its first line marks the winter solstice, its top line the *Jingzhe*. When *Li* completes its course at the *mao* midpoint, it exchanges with *Qian*; its first line marks the spring equinox, its top line the *Mangzhong*. When *Qian* completes its course at the *wu* midpoint, it exchanges with *Kan*; its first line marks the summer solstice, its top line the *Bailu*. When *Kan* completes its course at the *you* midpoint, it exchanges with *Kun*; its first line marks the autumn equinox, its top line the *Daxue*. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter each employ sixty-four hexagram qi, all arising from the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* midpoints as the four cardinals—two solstices and two equinoxes. The *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* positions correspond to the four *Meng* and four *Li*. In the *Jingshi* calendar, the winter solstice is the origin of heaven and earth, the origin of origins. Thus, it omits the four cardinal hexagrams and employs three hundred sixty. The *Guqi Tu* takes the spring equinox as the origin of humanity, also the origin of origins. Thus, it employs sixty-four hexagrams, multiplied fourfold to make two hundred fifty-six positions. The *Guqi Tu* takes the *zi* midpoint of the winter solstice as the origin of the world, the *mao* midpoint of the spring equinox as the origin of origins, the *wu* midpoint of the summer solstice as the origin of conjunctions, and the *you* midpoint of the autumn equinox as the origin of revolutions. Each employs sixty-four hexagrams, alternating according to qi and revolution. The inception of affairs and the unfolding of things begin at the *yin* midpoint, commencing at the *Jingzhe*, the second month’s first qi. The closure of things occurs at the *xu* midpoint, concluding at the *Lichun*, the tenth month’s first qi. Why? The *yin* and *xu* midpoints govern monthly conjunctions in name, but in function, they truly depend on the nodal qi. The earth’s generation of things relies on qi as its mechanism. Heaven’s qi arrives first, and only then do earth’s things respond. The qi’s arrival always precedes by half a month. Qi, by its nature, is ever-expansive and thus constantly overflows, while the moon, by its swiftness, is ever-contracting and thus constantly deficient. Thus, Guan Ziming said: \"In the reckoning of appointed times, that which exceeds is called *qi* surplus, while that which falls short is called new moon deficiency.\" The irregularities of *qi* surplus and new moon deficiency accumulate over time, so that the central qi may occasionally fall on the month’s last day. Intercalation is then applied to restore the original alignment.\n\nThe *Jingshi* is rooted in the *Xiantian*, thus its central conjunctions and new moons both arise from hexagram qi. Following the *Xiantian*’s fundamental numbers, it takes the central qi to govern the months. The origins of *yuan*, conjunctions, revolutions, and worlds all begin from the center—this is what is meant by \"establishing the correct from the center.\" The *Guqi Tu* states: \"The great revolution’s method should follow the *Jingshi*, its numbers beginning at *xing*, *jia*, *chen*, *zi*. The lesser revolution’s method should follow the *Guqi Tu*, beginning at *jia*, *si*, *Meng* days.\" Heaven unifies the forms. The form of qi arises from the four midpoints. Thus, the great revolution’s *jiazi* corresponds to the winter solstice, and the heads of the twenty-four qi all attain the four midpoints of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*. The function of qi operates through the four *Li*, thus the lesser revolution’s *jiayin* corresponds to the *Lichun*, and the heads of the twenty-four qi all attain the *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai* positions, reigning over the four *Meng*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: In the *Xiantian Tu*, the left side begins with the first line of *Zhen* as the winter solstice, the midpoints of *Li* and *Dui* as the spring equinox, and proceeds to the end of *Qian* to exchange with the summer solstice. The right side begins with the first line of *Xun* as the summer solstice, the midpoints of *Kan* and *Gen* as the autumn equinox, and proceeds to the end of *Kun* to exchange with the winter solstice. The diagram’s reversal and progression, left and right, have been detailed by earlier scholars. *Qian* as one, *Dui* as two, *Li* as three, *Zhen* as four—these are the generated hexagrams, their sequence proceeding from south to north. As for the circulation of hexagram qi, it proceeds from north to south. The first yang arises at the beginning of *Zhen*, thus Master Shao takes the *zi* midpoint of the winter solstice as *Fu*. The eleventh month’s midpoint is the *Xiaohan*, its hexagrams *Kan* and *Zhun*. The twelfth month’s *Chuji* is the *Dahan*, its hexagrams *Zhen*, *Shike*, and *Sui*. The first month’s *Yinchu* is the *Lichun*, its hexagrams *Wu Wang* and *Ming Yi*. The month’s midpoint is the *Yushui*, its hexagrams *Gui*, *Ji Ji*, and *Jia Ren*. The second month’s *Maochu* is the *Jingzhe*, its hexagrams *Feng*, *Li*, and *Ge*. The month’s midpoint is the spring equinox, its hexagrams *Tong Ren* and *Lin*. The third month’s *Chenchu* is the *Qingming*, its hexagrams *Sun*, *Jie*, and *Fu*. The month’s midpoint is the *Guyu*, its hexagrams *Mei*, *Kui*, and *Dui*. The *Sichu* of the fourth month is the *Lixia*, its hexagrams *Lü* and *Tai*. The month’s midpoint is the *Xiaoman*, its hexagrams *Da Xu*, *Xu*, and *Xiao Xu*. The *Wuchu* of the fifth month is the *Mangzhong*, its hexagrams *Da Zhuang*, *Da You*, and *Guai*. At the end of *Qian*, it exchanges with the summer solstice, which is the *wu* midpoint. These thirty-two hexagrams belong to yang and correspond to spring and summer.\n\nThe hexagrams *Xun* as five, *Kan* as six, *Gen* as seven, and *Kun* as eight are the ungenerated hexagrams. The diagram proceeds from west to north, but the circulation of hexagram qi begins with the first yin arising at the start of *Xun*, thus the *wu* midpoint of the summer solstice is the beginning. The fifth month’s midpoint is the *Xiazhi*, the sixth month’s *Weichu* is the *Xiaoshu*, its hexagrams *Da Guo*, *Ding*, and *Heng*. The month’s midpoint is the *Dashu*, its hexagrams *Xun*, *Jing*, and *Gu*. The *Shenchu* of the seventh month is the *Liqiu*, its hexagrams *Sheng* and *Song*.",

      "translated_text": "The Expansion and Contraction of Yang and Yin\n\nYang expands for six days, also called *qi* expansion. This accounts for the remainder of five and one-quarter days. Yin contracts for six days, also called new moon deficiency. This refers to the six days of lunar emptiness in a short month. Over one year, the total remainder of twelve days is allocated as intercalary months, honoring the supremacy of yang.\n\nThis describes the sun, moon, and five planets all revolving leftward with the heavens. The latter system follows the motions of the guards. It describes the sun, moon, and five planets all revolving rightward against the heavens. If the heavens revolve leftward, the sun and moon also revolve leftward. The sun’s motion falls short of the heavens, and the moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s—this sequence follows principle and is thus correct. Confucians regard this explanation as valid, adhering to the *prior heavens*.\n\nIf the heavens revolve leftward while the sun and moon revolve rightward against them, the sun moves slowly while the moon moves swiftly. Calendar scholars adopt this explanation for *Yi*-based calculations, adhering to the *posterior heavens*. Confucians do not accept this view but provisionally retain both for reference.\n\nThe *Canon of Yao* states: “Three hundred and sixty-six days, with intercalary months to fix the four seasons and complete the year.” The *Book of Documents* commentary says: “From this winter solstice to the next is one cycle. Within this cycle, there are either 366 days or slightly more than 365 days. The heavens and the sun converge above to form one year, comprising twenty-four qi. The interval between two years remains consistent, even when intercalary months occur.”\n\nThe *day divisor* is multiplied by 940 parts to measure the celestial circuit. The remainder beyond the full degrees is one-quarter of a day, for a day is divided into 940 parts. Dividing these into four yields 235 parts, which constitutes one degree. Thus, one-quarter of these parts is obtained.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “In terms of *qi*, there are 360 days; in terms of lunar phases, there are 354 days. Taking the median of *qi* expansion and lunar deficiency, we speak of 360 days. The remaining variations do not exceed six parts.” The *Canon of Yao* uses round numbers, hence “three hundred and sixty-six days.”\n\nHu Shenzhen said: “When reckoning the year by the four seasons, each season has ninety-four days and ninety parts. When reckoning by the six *qi*, each has sixty-six days and sixty parts. When reckoning by the five phases, each has seventy-two days and seventy-two parts. All yield 360 days. The two trigrams *Qian* and *Kun* follow the same principle—this is the norm of celestial numbers. Exceeding this is expansion; falling short is contraction.\n\nWhen expanded, the yang path is ever-abundant, so the sun’s circuit of the celestial degrees constitutes one year. Beyond the 360 days, the year consistently has a remainder of slightly more than five days. When contracted, the yin path is ever-deficient, so the moon’s circuit of the celestial degrees constitutes one month, consistently falling short of thirty days. This is why there are short months and why the year has a remainder of slightly more than five days. Accumulated over the years, this yields the so-called eleven-day deficit. The surplus of accumulated years—once every three years, twice every five, and seven times every nineteen years—completes the great pattern of the heavens.\n\nThe sun and moon cannot be without expansion and contraction, and calendar makers cannot avoid discrepancies. Thus, intercalary months are established to stabilize the seasons and complete the year.” The *Supreme Principles Governing the World* also takes 360 as the standard: one *yuan* comprises 360 *yun*, one *hui* comprises 360 *shi*, one *yun* comprises 360 years, one *shi* comprises 360 months, one year comprises 360 days, and one month comprises 360 *chen*. Yang attains 360 through the number six.\n\nMaster Zhang of Hengqu said: “The sun and moon both revolve leftward.” His explanation: “The heavens are exceedingly vigorous, completing one circuit of 365¼ degrees in one day and night. They then exceed this by one degree. The sun’s motion, though swift, is secondary to the heavens. In one day and night, it completes 365¼ degrees, precisely matching the heavens’ advance of one degree, which causes the sun to appear to retreat by one degree. Over two days, the heavens advance two degrees, and the sun retreats two degrees. Accumulating over 365¼ days, the heavens’ excess degrees complete a full cycle, and the sun’s retreating degrees also exhaust their original count, reuniting with the heavens to form one year.\n\nThe moon moves slowly, completing 365¼ degrees in one day and night but falling short of the heavens by slightly more than thirteen degrees.” Master Zhu said: “If one assumes the heavens complete one circuit daily without excess while the sun falls short by one degree, how can the mid-star positions of the four seasons differ? If this were so, what would define the boundaries of the seasons? As days pass like lamps relayed in succession, noon would soon strike the third watch.”\n\nHere, I cite two passages from the *Monthly Ordinances* commentary that clarify the matter; other calendrical works do not explain it thus. If we consider the heavens’ motion internally, they complete only 365¼ degrees. If we consider them externally, they exceed one degree per day. The sun and moon are discussed within the heavens; if observed from the great void, the heavens themselves are not fixed in their former positions.\n\nHe further said: “The sun and moon both begin at *Jiao*. The sun completes one circuit daily, returning to *Jiao*, while the heavens complete one circuit and slightly surpass *Jiao*. This accumulates daily, and after one year, they reunite with the sun.”\n\nIn my humble opinion, the explanations of these two masters reveal that the heavens’ motion exceeds, the moon’s falls short, and only the sun’s motion is correct. Thus, one year is reckoned at 360 days. Master Shao said: “Yang *qi* expands upon 360. In one year, the sun’s reunion with the heavens exceeds five days and 235 parts, constituting *qi* expansion. Each day’s *qi* expansion is 13 parts, 7 *li*, 8 *si*, and 3 *hu*.”",

      "translated_text": "Between two *lichun* solar terms, there are in total 4,935 parts, which together constitute the excess of five days and 235 parts. Speaking in whole numbers, the heavens exceed by six days. This is the measure by which the sun’s motion falls short of the heavens.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The celestial body is perfectly round, with a circumference of 365¼ degrees. Revolving leftward around the earth, it completes one full circuit each day while surpassing one degree. The sun, attached to the heavens yet slightly slower, also completes one circuit around the earth daily, but in relation to the heavens, it falls short by one degree. Over 365 days and 940/940 of a day—specifically 235 parts—it reunites with the heavens. This is the measure of the sun’s annual motion.”\n\nAccording to Kong’s commentary: “The heavens are the great void, inherently formless; we merely designate the revolving stars as ‘heaven.’ The heavens envelop the earth like the white surrounds the yolk. The stars revolve from east to west, completing one cycle in 365¼ days before returning to their original positions. While the stars turn leftward, the sun moves rightward, also taking 365¼ days to return to its original stellar position. These stars are the twenty-eight lunar lodges, distributed across the four directions, forming the celestial body. Each lodge spans 13 degrees and 402 parts, totaling 365¼ degrees. Whether measured in celestial degrees or annual days, the count remains the same. Yet due to the excess or deficiency of *qi*, there arises the waxing and waning of time.” The preceding explanations have thoroughly addressed this.\n\nIn my humble opinion: If the heavens’ motion were without excess, matching the sun’s, and the moon’s motion without deficiency, also matching the sun’s—if every day they all returned to *Jiao* and every year consisted of exactly 360 days without remainder—then there would be no irregularity in cold and heat, no variation in the size of days and months, no droughts or floods. Were the heavens to impose such rigid uniformity upon humanity, the workings of creation would lose their pattern. How then could the mechanisms of spirits reward virtue and punish vice operate?\n\nHe further said: “Yin *qi* contracts upon 360. Each month’s new moon lacks 441 parts. From *zi* to *chou*, the moon totals 5,292 parts. Together with the deficiency of five days and 592 parts—rounded to six days—this constitutes the measure by which the moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s.”\n\nMaster Zhu said: “The moon, attached to the heavens, is even slower. Each day, it falls short of the heavens by 13 degrees and 7/19 of a degree. Over 29 days and 499/940 of a day, it reunites with the sun. Twelve such conjunctions yield 348 full days, with an accumulated remainder of 5,988 parts. Divided by the day divisor of 940, this gives six days and a remainder of 348, totaling 354 days and 348/940 of a day. This is the measure of the moon’s annual motion.”\n\nIn my humble analysis: The “7/19 of a degree” means dividing 940 parts into nineteen portions, each portion being 49 parts, 4 *li*, 2 *hao*, 1 *hu*, 5 *si*, 7 *miao*, and 6 *shao*—the daily shortfall by which the moon lags behind the heavens and the sun’s regular motion. Thus, each day, the moon falls short of the sun by 12 degrees and 346 parts. Over 29 days and 499 parts, its accumulated shortfall reaches 365 degrees and 235 parts—the very degrees by which the sun advances. At this point, the sun’s excess precisely completes its full cycle, while the moon’s deficiency is entirely exhausted. They reunite to form one month. Twelve such periods of 29 days yield 348 full days, and twelve accumulations of 499 parts total 5,988. Divided by the day divisor of 940, this results in six days and a remainder of 348.\n\nFor yang is whole while yin is half; yang is ever in excess, yin ever in contraction. The sun’s motion constantly surpasses the moon’s, while the moon’s motion constantly falls short of the sun’s. In one year, intercalary days arise from the *qi* excess and new moon deficiency, totaling 10 days and 827 parts—rounded to twelve days. These are used to establish intercalary months. Every three years, one intercalary month is added, accumulating three sets of 10 days and 827 parts—32 days and 601 parts, or thirty-six days in whole numbers. After five years, a second intercalary month is added, accumulating five sets of 10 days and 827 parts—54 days and 275 parts, or sixty days in whole numbers. Generally, an intercalary month occurs every thirty-two days, though not precisely uniform, the variation is not great. Thus, the sages devised the calendar, redistributing the remainders to compensate for the moon’s shortfall relative to the sun and the sun’s shortfall relative to the heavens. By harmonizing these three cycles into one, over twenty-nine years, the *qi*, new moons, and divisions align perfectly with the celestial timing, leaving no discrepancy even as fine as a hair’s breadth. Human affairs, too, proceed in accord with the seasons.\n\nSomeone asked about the celestial calendar: “The varying lengths of months are already set in the almanac; one need only calculate them. For instance, if the crescent appears on the second day, the preceding month was long; if on the third, it was short. As the dark bird arrives in the second month and departs in the eighth, so too do things follow this pattern.” An elder once said: “The sun and moon meet between the last and first days of the lunar month. On the first evening, the sight is most splendid: as the sun sets, a faint glow lingers, and the moon follows in its descent. By the second day, they are slightly farther apart. After the third day, as the crescent waxes, the distance gradually increases. By the fifteenth day, when the moon is full and opposite the sun, the sun’s swift motion has carried it halfway across the sky.”",
      "overlap_context": "This accumulates daily, and after one year, they reunite with the sun.”\n\nIn my humble opinion, the explanations of these two masters reveal that the heavens’ motion exceeds, the moon’s falls short, and only the sun’s motion is correct. Thus, one year is reckoned at 360 days. Master Shao said: “Yang *qi* expands upon 360. In one year, the sun’s reunion with the heavens exceeds five days and 235 parts, constituting *qi* expansion. Each day’s *qi* expansion is 13 parts, 7 *li*, 8 *si*, and 3 *hu*.”",

      "translated_text": "The moon’s motion falls short of the sun’s, yet its retreat also covers half the heavens. From the sixteenth day to the month’s end, the sun’s course fully spans one celestial revolution, while the moon’s shortfall likewise completes one revolution. Thus, the sun advances through its full measure, the moon retreats through its full measure, and they meet again.\n\nMaster Shao said: “A year’s intercalation consists of six yin and six yang phases. Three years yield thirty-six days, hence one intercalary month every three years. Five years yield sixty days, hence two intercalary months every five years. Nineteen years yield two hundred twenty-eight days. Thus, seven intercalary months leave no remainder, and the calendar takes nineteen years as one *zhang*. That seven intercalary months yield two hundred twenty-eight days is the origin of the intercalation method.\n\nThe method of placing intercalary months arises from the irregular motions of the sun and moon. The sun travels one degree of the heavens per day, while the moon travels thirteen degrees and seven nineteenths of a degree per day. The thirteen degrees account for twelve revolutions of the heavens in one year, while the remaining seven nineteenths form the intercalary fraction. Thus, the intercalation method takes seven and nineteen as its basis: multiplying seven by twelve yields eighty-four, the number of months in seven years; multiplying nineteen by twelve yields two hundred twenty-eight, the number of months in nineteen years. Hence, within a year, one takes months; within a day, one takes hours. Then, taking eighty-four as seven parts and two hundred twenty-eight as nineteen parts, beginning from one hour and accumulating to one day yields a remainder of seven parts. Multiplying this by the thirty days in a month yields two hundred ten parts. Twelve months yield two thousand five hundred twenty parts, with every nineteen parts constituting one hour. A year thus contains one hundred thirty-two hours and eleven days, with a remainder of twelve parts. Multiplying this by the nineteen-year cycle yields forty-seven thousand eight hundred eighty parts. Dividing according to the method, each year yields eleven days and a remainder of twelve parts. Over nineteen years, this totals two hundred nine days and a remainder of two hundred twenty-eight parts, which, when converted into the divisions of a day’s twelve hours, equals two hundred ten days. Thus, nineteen years with seven intercalary months leave no remainder.\n\nTo determine the year, set seven parts per year, and when nineteen parts are reached, an intercalary month is added—thus knowing the year to intercalate. Multiplying the twelve months by the number of years yields eighty-four parts per year; when two hundred twenty-eight parts are reached, an intercalary month is added—thus knowing the month to intercalate. To determine the day, set seven intercalary parts per day, and when nineteen parts are reached, one hour of intercalation is gained—thus knowing the day of the intercalary new moon. Multiplying the twelve hours by the number of days yields eighty-four parts; when two hundred twenty-eight parts are reached, one hour of intercalation is gained—thus knowing the time of conjunction.\n\nThe mutual reckoning of seven and nineteen is the rough method of intercalation; the mutual reckoning of eighty-four and two hundred twenty-eight is the precise method. Intercalation originates from odd numbers, accumulating to seven and reaching completion at nineteen. Thus, seven and nineteen, when multiplied or divided by each other, both yield one hundred thirty-three. Since the methods for months and hours are derived by multiplying by twelve, they must also be divided by twelve, yielding two hundred twenty-eight. The parts of one month and the days of one *zhang* are both two hundred ten. Hence, the *Xici* speaks of “returning the odd to the beginning to symbolize intercalation,” while the *Xiantian* uses one hundred thirty-three for the number of days and one hundred five for the number of stars.\n\nIntercalation is fundamentally the odd number of heaven, yet it is sought through the moon. Thus, one knows that yang takes yin as its measure, and yin and yang mutually constitute substance and function. Multiplying two hundred twenty-eight by ten and then doubling it yields forty-five million six hundred thousand—the number of one *yuan* in the *Sifen* calendar.\n\nIt is also said: the sun advances by slowing, the moon retreats by hastening. When the sun and moon meet, half a day is added and half a day is subtracted, forming the intercalary remainder. The sun advances six days in one great revolution, the moon retreats six days in one great revolution—this is the intercalary difference. The heavens rotate leftward, while the sun and moon revolve rightward; their degrees have been explained earlier. The moon completes one revolution of the heavens each month, yet this is merely its apparent motion. Its actual conjunction with the sun occurs in the final day and a half, always trailing behind the sun. Thus, the sun, though slow, is deemed to advance, while the moon, though swift, is deemed to retreat.\n\nThe sun and moon meet every thirty days, though in reality it is twenty-nine and a half days. For the moon’s true period is twenty-nine and a half days, while the sun’s is thirty and a half days, yet both are reckoned as thirty days. Thus, at each conjunction, the sun gains half a day, and the moon loses half a day. The gain of half a day arises because the sun’s yearly course exceeds the moon’s by six days, and an additional six days are added. The loss of half a day arises because the moon’s yearly course falls short of the sun’s by six days, and an additional six days are subtracted. The accumulation of these gains and losses forms the intercalary remainder.\n\nIn one great revolution, the sun and moon advance and retreat by twelve days, yielding one intercalary month every three years and two intercalary months every five years—this is the intercalary difference. Three intercalary months in eight years, four in ten years, five in thirteen years, six in sixteen years, and seven in nineteen years. Extending this reckoning endlessly is called *tong*.\n\nMaster Zi said: “The year is at peace, yet the *nian* is afflicted.” The year is at peace when its reckoning is complete; the *nian* is afflicted when its reckoning is deficient, and intercalation compensates for it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: “Intercalation is determined by the central qi. The central qi belongs to its own month; if it falls after the month’s end, that month is to be intercalated.” The Dipper’s pointer indicates the central qi; the positions of the sun and moon, where the Dipper’s pointer lies between two celestial markers, is the place of their conjunction. If there is no central qi, the month is intercalated. As the Dipper’s handle shifts leftward and the sun and moon revolve rightward, the celestial markers and the established months remain in constant alignment.\n\nThe heavens are divided by boundaries, passing through the degrees and minutes of the palaces. Master Wang Yan said: “Using the degrees of the celestial revolution, one allocates them among the twelve palaces.”",

      "translated_text": "The passage through each celestial palace is marked by specific divisions. One hundred seconds make a minute, and one hundred minutes make a degree. The year completes its cycle in 365 days and a quarter, aligning with the full celestial degrees at the advent of spring. The month completes its cycle in 30 days and a fraction, aligning with the degrees of a single palace at each nodal transition. Degrees serve as boundaries, and the celestial wheel is demarcated by these limits. The sun advances one degree per day, thus requiring 365 days and 25 *ke* to traverse the entire celestial boundary. The moon travels slightly more than twelve degrees—astrologers commonly say thirteen degrees for simplicity. The moon completes one full celestial circuit each month, traversing the entire celestial boundary. A month does not precisely comprise thirty days. With months of varying lengths, two months totaling fifty-nine days complete two full cycles. Generally, the moon completes one celestial circuit in slightly more than twenty-nine and a half days, and two circuits in slightly more than fifty-nine days.\n\nI contend that ancient and modern calendar-makers have merely calculated the boundaries between yin and yang. This is why Confucius did not expound on calendrics but simply said, \"Follow the Xia calendar’s seasons.\" It is also said: The theory of the heavens rotating leftward is akin to a large wheel on the outside with a smaller wheel carrying the sun and moon within. The large wheel turns swiftly, while the small wheel turns slowly. Though both rotate leftward, their differing speeds create the illusion that the sun and moon move rightward. The celestial body and its motion, along with the solar and lunar degrees, should be understood through four wheels for clarity.\n\nNow, envision the large wheel as the heavens revolving externally—what is meant by \"the heavens envelop the earth\"—moving evenly and expansively, covering slightly more than a quarter of the celestial degrees. The smaller wheel carries the sun and moon internally, being smaller than the heavens, thus rotating inwardly and contracting. The moon’s motion lags behind the sun’s by slightly less than a quarter of its degrees. Therefore, the sun falls short of the heavens by one degree, and the moon falls short of the sun by slightly more than twelve degrees. The outer envelops the inner, the outer expansive, the inner contracted. Their speeds and trajectories naturally follow this pattern. Observing this through the four divisions makes it clear.\n\nYears ago, I saw a diagram crafted by my friend Wu Jiuxia that aligned with this understanding. The outermost ring marked the celestial degrees as the celestial body. The second ring showed the heavens beginning at *Jiao*, completing one full revolution each day while advancing one degree past *Jiao*. The third ring depicted the sun also starting at *Jiao*, following the heavens but advancing one degree less per day, returning precisely to *Jiao* without excess. Thus, it falls short of the heavens by one degree. Each day, the sun retreats by one degree, exhausting its full measure. The heavens advance one degree daily, returning to their original position to align with the celestial degrees, completing one cycle. The fourth ring illustrated the moon’s slower motion, falling short of the sun by 12 degrees and 346.5 parts, accumulating to slightly more than twenty-nine days. The moon falls short of the sun’s degrees by 365 degrees and 235 parts, exhausting its full measure before reuniting with the sun, forming one month and twelve conjunctions. Calculating the moon’s deficit to the sun yields 5 days and 592 parts, with new moons, conjunctions, and intercalary adjustments totaling 10 days and 827 parts to establish intercalation. The specifics are not recorded here.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the meaning of Kangjie’s theory of \"concealed intercalation\" and \"manifest intercalation\"? I replied: The details are not easily explained. Briefly, a year consists of 360 days with an excess of 6 days concealed within the six *jia*—each *jia* spanning two months conceals one day. Six *jia* (360 days) conceal six days. \"Manifest intercalation\" refers to the period from *kaiwu* to *biwu*, where seven-tenths are utilized, and three-tenths are discarded at the nodal transitions. Of the original 360 days, 240 are used, yielding 252 days. The intercalary number twelve is manifested beyond the 240 days.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Calendar* discusses the *Tai Chu* calendar of Emperor Zhuanxu and the *Four Divisions Calendar*. Liu Xin later revised it into the *Three Sequences Calendar*, while Yi Xing’s *Great Expansion Calendar* is the most detailed. The astronomical records of the Five Dynasties are also concise and rigorous, yet all these calendars—whether adding 720 or subtracting—remained accurate for only two or three years. Among ancient and modern calendars, only Kangjie’s calendar employed 129,600 parts, hence its precision.\n\nI shall now summarize the calendars of previous dynasties:\n\nThe *Four Divisions Calendar* was created by Emperor Zhuanxu, based on the *Lianshan*’s *Book of Changes* beginning with *Gen*. It derived from the *River Chart*, expanding ten to one hundred, and dividing by four to yield twenty-five, aligning with the celestial degrees’ quarter division. The Qin dynasty used this calendar, designating the tenth month as the first. Emperor Wu of Han later revised it into the *Tai Chu Calendar*.\n\nThe *Tai Chu Calendar* was crafted by Tang Du, Luo Xia Hong, and others during Emperor Wu’s reign. It designated the first month as *yin*, renaming the seventh year of *Yuanfeng* (71 BCE) as the first year of *Tai Chu*, with the year named *Feng Jia She Ti Ge Yin* and the month named *Bi Ju*. The first day was *Jiazi* at midnight, coinciding with the winter solstice. This revision aligned with the *jia* year of Emperor Zhuanxu’s calendar’s inception, matching the auspicious omen of \"linked jades and joined pearls.\" The year was not *jia yin* but the following one.\n\nThe *Three Sequences Calendar* was Liu Xin’s revision of the *Tai Chu Calendar*. Three threes make nine, and nine nines make eighty-one, forming the *Sequence Mother*. *Huang Zhong* marks the celestial sequence’s first *jiazi* beginning, *Lin Zhong* the earthly sequence’s second *jiachen* beginning, and *Tai Cu* the human sequence’s third *jia* middle beginning. Its epoch aligns with the *Tai Chu*’s commencement at *Huang Zhong*’s pitch (see previous *Xuan Tu* annotations).\n\nThe *Tai Xuan Calendar* was created by Yang Xiong of Han, corresponding to the *Yan Tian Chu* and *Zhuan Calendar*. The *Tai Chu* expanded the *Luoshu*’s nine nines, totaling the *Four Divisions*’ numerical essence.",

      "translated_text": "The *Zhuan Calendar* expands its numbers by ten tens, dividing the *Hetu* into four parts—its core is the \"void center\" number. The *Tai Chu* takes eighty-one as its *ri fa* (day divisor), being nine nines. The *Tai Xuan* takes seventy-two as its *ri fa*, being eight nines. The *Tai Chu* takes thirty-two as its *chao fa* (fractional divisor), being eight fours. The *Tai Xuan* takes thirty-six as its *chao fa*, being nine fours. Comparing the *Xuan* to the *Chu*, dividing by nine and subtracting one second, or adding one to nine, both yield 2,592 seconds. Though their beginnings differ, their ends converge—see *Gua Qi* for details.\n\nThe *Tai Yan Calendar* was created by Tang’s Yi Xing. From Han to Sui, all calendars followed pitch-standards, but Yi Xing relied solely on the *Great Expansion*, rooted in *Gua Qi*. This is the \"void center\" number of the *Hetu*, taking the sum of one-six, two-seven, three-eight, and four-nine from the four directions to symbolize the four seasons. The void center’s five and ten combine to form the *yan mu* (expansion mother), while the old and young of nine-six and seven-eight serve as its application. The line numbers extend to sixty *ce* (counting rods), and the numbers proceed through 420—this is the *Great Expansion*, the pivot of Heaven and Earth. Later creators could not alter it.\n\nThe *Xian De Tong Tian Calendar* was created by Wang Pu of the Five Dynasties. Ouyang Xiu recorded it in his *Astronomical Examination*, establishing it as an independent school. Yang comprises thirty-six *ce*, yin twenty-four *ce*. The union of yin and yang numbers completes transformation, both yielding seventy-two. Doubling this gives 720, doubling again yields 720,000, and once more 72,000,000. When the *yuan* (primary cycle) generates the *yuan* (origin), years, months, days, and hours all align as *jiazi*. The conjunction of the sun, moon, and five planets at *zi* determines excess and deficiency, their mean positions, and the harmony of the seven luminaries.\n\nIn my view, among ancient and modern calendars, none surpass the Han *Tai Chu* and the Tang *Tai Yan*. Both originate from the *Hetu*, while intervening calendars merely adjust them. The six pitch-standards employ the *Luoshu*, beginning with odd numbers. The eight trigrams employ the *Hetu*, beginning with even numbers. Though their applications differ, all follow the *Posterior Heaven* *Yi*. At that time, the *Prior Heaven Diagram* remained hidden and unemerged.\n\nThe *Prior Heaven Calendar* was the foundation of Shao Yong’s *Huang Ji Jing Shi*. Its method derives from the multiplication of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches: the sun as *jia*, the moon as *zi*, the stars as *jiachen* and *zichou*, called the *Four Images*. In grand reckoning, these are termed *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*; in smaller reckoning, years, months, days, and hours. The sun’s *jia* governs one *tong*, the moon’s *zi* twelve; the stars’ *jia* governs 360 *tong*, and the *chen*’s *zi* 4,320. Altogether, thirty-six *jia* are evenly distributed among the twelve *chen*, each *chen* receiving 360.\n\nThe *Prior Heaven Calendar* differs from the *Posterior Heaven Calendar*. Excluding intercalary calculations, one year comprises twelve *hui*, 360 *yun*, 4,320 *shi*, and 129,600 years. This is why Master Zhu highly praised Kangjie’s calendar. I conclude this account of various calendars here.\n\nMaster Cheng also said: \"In calendrical studies, if one grasps the underlying principles, much becomes clear. Only Shao Yaofu established a method for differences at the juncture of mutual influence, unmatched in antiquity or modernity. Yet in seeking the sun and moon’s yang excess and yin deficiency, he erred precisely where precision was most critical.\"\n\n*The Heavenly Origin Explored*, Scroll Twelve, concludes.\n*The Heavenly Origin Explored*, Scroll Thirteen\nCompiled and annotated by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated and proofread by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu",

      "translated_text": "The Symbolic Forms and Numerical Patterns\n\nThe Yellow River yielded the *Diagram*, and the Eight Trigrams were drawn—thus yin and yang first took form. The Luo River yielded the *Script*, and the Nine Categories were arranged—thus the Five Phases first took number. Form cannot stand without the even; number cannot proceed without the odd. These two may possess each other, but cannot be without each other.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Heaven and Earth merely cannot speak; it is the sage who speaks for them. If Heaven and Earth could speak, one imagines they would say it even better. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Script* are the *Changes* that Heaven and Earth have drawn.\" Fu Xi, gazing above and below, saw that all between Heaven and Earth was the *Changes*. The emergence of the *River Diagram* precisely matched his heart, so he followed it to draw the trigrams. Later generations’ failure to comprehend the study of symbolic forms and numerical patterns had its reasons.\n\nZhu Shiyu of Hanshang said: \"Shang Qu learned from the Master; from Ding Kuan onward, his lineage flowed into Meng Xi and Jing Fang. Even in the Tang, their *Changes* could still be examined. Yixing compiled the *Changes* of these two schools, discussing hexagram qi, the absorption of the celestial stems into the Five Phases, and the like—all derived from the *Great Commentary* of the *Zhou Changes*, the *Appended Remarks*, and the *Discussion of the Trigrams*. Later, Ma [Rong], Zheng [Xuan], Xun [Shuang], and Yu [Fan] each established their own schools, yet they did not stray far from the source of symbolic forms and numerical patterns. In the Wei, Wang Bi and Zhong Hui, though fellow students, entirely discarded the old explanations, mingling them with Lao-Zhuang thought. They prized literary expression alone, no longer tracing back to origins. The Way of Heaven and humanity thus split. The *Great Commentary* states: 'The Yellow River yielded the *Diagram*; the Luo River yielded the *Script*—the sage took them as models.'\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Kong Anguo said the *River Diagram* refers to when Fu Xi ruled the world and a dragon-horse emerged from the Yellow River; he then followed its markings to draw the Eight Trigrams. The *Luo Script* refers to when Yu controlled the floods and a divine turtle bore markings on its back, with numbers up to nine. Yu then arranged them into nine categories.\"\n\nI humbly observe: At the dawn of Heaven and Earth, the Great Harmony was undifferentiated, and symbolic forms and numerical patterns were not yet manifest. These *River Diagram* and *Luo Script* were how Heaven opened the sage’s understanding. The *Analects* says: \"The Yellow River does not yield the *Diagram*.\" The *Changes* says: \"The Yellow River and Luo River yield the *Diagram* and *Script*.\" The *Documents* says: \"The Heavenly Jade and *River Diagram*.\" Thus, the *Diagram* and *Script* are the natural patterns of Heaven and Earth, treasured objects through the ages, not the work of human effort. How could Masters Ma and Ou have further explanations?\n\nYet some indulge in the bizarre and absurd: the *Huainanzi* speaks of cinnabar writings and green diagrams; the *Spring and Autumn* apocrypha speak of nine chapters and six chapters. Gu Yewang took the eighteen characters of \"agricultural use\" and \"reverent use\" from the *Luo Script* as what the divine turtle bore. Ban Gu took the sixty-five characters from \"one\" to \"six extremes\" as the original text of the *Luo Script*. Kong Yingda of the Tang said: \"Heaven’s words are concise and essential; they should not be so verbose and convoluted.\" Only Kong Anguo’s words are most apt, which is why Master Zhu adopted them.\n\nIt further states: \"Heaven one, Earth two; Heaven three, Earth four; Heaven five, Earth six; Heaven seven, Earth eight; Heaven nine, Earth ten. The numbers of Heaven are five; the numbers of Earth are five. The five positions interact, each having its pair. The numbers of Heaven total twenty-five; the numbers of Earth total thirty—this is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits operate.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"This is how the Master elucidated the numbers of the *River Diagram*. Its positions: one and six below, two and seven above, three and eight to the left, four and nine to the right. Five at the center is the generating mother; ten next is the generating child. Then one, two, three, four—the positions of the Four Images. Then six, seven, eight, nine—the numbers of the Four Images. The two elders occupy the northwest; the two youths occupy the southwest. Their numbers each interact by category externally. Moreover, the phrase 'each having its pair' encompasses all the numbers of the *River Diagram*.\"\n\nI humbly observe: The numbers of Heaven are the sum of the five odd numbers; the numbers of Earth are the sum of the five even numbers. One pairs with two to make an even; three pairs with four to make an even; five pairs with six to make an even; seven pairs with eight to make an even; nine pairs with ten to make an even. Each follows its odd or even counterpart, pairing like brothers—thus they follow their sequence without disorder. One pairs with six as Water; two pairs with seven as Fire; three pairs with eight as Wood; four pairs with nine as Metal; five pairs with ten as Earth. Each matches yin and yang like husband and wife—thus they unite in harmony without separation.\n\nTen Celestial Stems are likewise: Yang *jia* pairs with yin *yi* as Wood; *jia* departing to pair with *ji* transforms into Earth. Yang *bing* pairs with yin *ding* as Fire; *bing* departing to pair with *xin* transforms into Water. Yang *wu* pairs with yin *ji* as Earth; *wu* departing to pair with *gui* transforms into Fire. Yang *geng* pairs with yin *xin* as Metal; *yi* coming to pair with *geng* transforms into Metal. Yang *ren* pairs with yin *gui* as Water; *ding* coming to pair with *ren* transforms into Wood. All are the doubling of the Five Phases uniting into one. There must be pairing, and within pairing, there is mutual generation and overcoming, similarity and difference—unevenness. This is how the Five Constants—ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, senior and junior—interact with the Five Phases and cannot be separated.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest pairing: one, three, five, seven, nine combine as the numbers of Heaven, yet do not depart from five. Two, four, six, eight, ten combine as the numbers of Earth, yet do not depart from five. The wondrous union of two and five generates humans and all things, totaling fifty-five. Five is the center. Center means change; change means transformation—its Dao is inexhaustible. One changes and six transforms; two transforms and seven changes; three becomes eight; four becomes nine; five becomes ten.",

      "translated_text": "Transformation gives rise to change, and change gives rise to transformation. The interplay of odd and even generates all things—flexion and extension, coming and going—all emerge from the *Hetu* (River Diagram). Within the five numbers of Heaven and Earth, how could they be likened to the later generations’ talk of ghosts and spirits, of transformations and changes, which drifts into absurdity?\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The *Hetu* governs the five generating numbers to unify the five completing numbers. The *Luoshu* (Luo Writing) governs the five odd numbers to unify the four even numbers.\" Master Zhu further stated: \"The generating numbers all reside within; the generating is the heart-mind of Heaven and Earth. The completing numbers all reside without; the completing is the achievement of Heaven and Earth.\" This saying is most profound.\n\nIn my humble observation: The *Hetu* divides yin and yang by generation and completion. The generating numbers—one, two, three, four, five—belong to yang and reside within. The completing numbers—six, seven, eight, nine, ten—belong to yin and reside without. The generating governs the completing, the inner harmonizes with the outer. The center is the host, while the outer is the guest. This is what is meant by \"the constant of the body, each residing in its proper place.\"\n\nThe *Luoshu* divides yin and yang by odd and even. One, three, seven, and nine occupy the four cardinal positions, paired with the four yang trigrams. Two, four, six, eight, and ten occupy the four diagonal positions, paired with the four yin trigrams. The odd governs the even, the noble oversees the humble. The cardinal is the ruler, while the diagonal is the minister—this is what is meant by \"through the changes of numbers, each resides in its proper place.\"\n\nYet the two diagrams, in their constancy and change, cannot be rigidly confined. In the *Hetu*, young yin and old yang remain unmoving, while young yang resides in the south, corresponding to the *Qian* position, and old yang resides in the west, corresponding to the *Kan* position—this does not align with the sequence of trigram generation. In the *Luoshu*, old yang resides in the south, corresponding to *Qian*, and young yang resides in the west, corresponding to *Kan*—this, in turn, aligns with the sequence of trigram generation. This is what is meant by \"within constancy there is change, within change there is constancy\"—its subtlety is beyond fathoming.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The round is the stars. Could the reckoning of calendrical cycles originate from this?\" The *Tang Treatise on Astronomy* states in its \"Discussion on Calendar Origins\": \"The numbers of Heaven begin with one, the numbers of Earth begin with two. Combining the two beginnings determines hardness and softness. The numbers of Heaven center on five, the numbers of Earth center on six. Combining the two centers unifies pitch standards and calendrical reckoning. Heaven has five notes to govern the days, Earth has six pitches to govern the hours.\" Master Zhu’s explanation of this is detailed; it need not be repeated here.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Li* is the stars, *Zhen* is the hours. The stars combine with the ten of the sun—ten of the sun is five. The hours are the twelve branches—twelve is six. Five and six nurture the center of yin and yang; the *Scriptures of the Ages* use this to establish the calendar. Nine and ten interact; calculation methods arise from this interval. Thus it has been since the inception of calendrical and celestial observation.\"\n\nThe round is the stars. The *Hetu* lacks those four corners, conforming to its round shape. The numbers of the *Hetu* never fail to align with the numbers of the stars. Zhang said: \"The celestial body’s number is seven, the Northern Dipper has seven stars. The sun, moon, and five planets number seven, and the twenty-eight lunar mansions total four times seven, making seven sevens. Including the six stars of the Southern Dipper, this sums to fifty-five numbers. From this, we know that in the interactions of Heaven, Earth, and human culture, all correspond to the numbers of the *Hetu*.\"\n\nHe further said: \"The square is the earth. The method of dividing land into nine fields may derive from this.\" Master Zhu said: \"A province has nine fields of nine hundred *mu*—this is the method of dividing land into nine fields.\" In my humble observation: The square is the pattern of the *Luoshu*. The earth has four directions; the *Book of Documents* places yang numbers in the four cardinal positions, symbolizing the division of land into well-fields. The *Book of Documents* takes nine as its foundation, also symbolizing the nine hundred *mu* of the well-fields. Heaven bestowed the Nine Categories; Yu received this *Luoshu* while regulating the waters. Thus, he opened the way for distinguishing the nine provinces, assessing the land, determining tribute, and exhaustively applying effort to irrigation channels. Yu accomplished the Nine Achievements, bringing enduring benefit to all under Heaven for myriad generations—from this, we know the greatness of the nine-chaptered *Luoshu*.\n\nHe further said: \"The round is the numbers of the *Hetu*; the square is the pattern of the *Luoshu*. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen relied on them to create the *Yijing*, while Yu and Jizhong used them to compose the *Great Plan*. Numbers begin with one yin and one yang. The image of yang is round, so the *Hetu* is round in form yet square in number. The image of yin is square, so the *Luoshu* is square in form yet round in number. This is what is meant by 'three for Heaven, two for Earth.'\"\n\nThe *Hetu* is ten and square, hence the *Great Commentary* contains the passage on \"fifty-five.\" The *Luoshu* is nine and round, hence the *Great Plan* contains the section on \"Heaven’s bestowal of the Nine Categories.\" In the primordial era, Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, each had their images, but initially, there were no numbers. With the *Hetu*, the fifty-five numbers emerged. The interplay of odd and even, generation and completion, became clearly visible. This is how it profoundly manifests the unique wisdom of the sages.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"One to ten form the *Hetu*; its center is left empty to create the *Yijing*. The *Hetu* is round in form, symbolizing Heaven, and ten and square in number, symbolizing Earth.

      "translated_text": "The ceaseless generation of life is called the *Yi*. When its center is emptied, the Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams. Thus it is said: \"One generates two, two generates four, four generates eight.\" The *Hetu* also contains the purport of the *Luoshu*. Between Heaven and Earth, if there were only generation without overcoming, how could generation be accomplished? If there were only overcoming without generation, the human kind would perish. This is why the workings of creation are revealed through the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*.\n\nIt is also said: from one to nine forms the *Luoshu*; filling its center makes it the *Fan*. The *Luoshu* is square in form, resembling Earth, and its numbers total nine, round like Heaven. The yang numbers sum to twenty-five, the yin numbers to twenty, together forty-five—thus the odd exceeds while the even is deficient. When its center is emptied, it is also the Supreme Ultimate. The odd numbers each total twenty, forming the Two Modes. One, two, three, four contain six, seven, eight, nine; their vertical and horizontal sums of fifteen also form the Four Images. The central five, combined with the forty, likewise yields the *Dayan*’s number. Accumulating five and ten gives fifteen, which together form the *Hetu*’s numbers. The *Shu* and the *Tu* mutually complement each other.\n\nThe *Shu* takes the completed numbers, rotating rightward from north and west: water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, and water overcomes fire again. Yet, in terms of opposing positions: the southeast’s four and nine (metal) generate the northwest’s one and six (water); the northeast’s three and eight (wood) generate the southwest’s two and seven (fire). Thus, the generating is already latent within the overcoming. Overcoming is the means by which generation is accomplished. That which fills the center is five, which the *Huangji* takes as its foundation.\n\nMaster Kong of the Tang said: The *Huangji* does not speak of numbers because it encompasses the Nine Categories, unifying eight with one and standing at the center of Heaven. The Five Phases, Five Affairs, each five; the Eight Governances, Eight and Five Regulations, five. The *Huangji* alone occupies one and three; virtue three, divination seven, all governance ten, the utmost blessings born of the ultimate—these nine categories, too, encompass the numbers of the *Hetu*.\n\nIt is also said: Both the *Tu* and the *Shu* place five at the center. Five is the number that balances Heaven’s three and Earth’s two. Master Zhu said: The *Hetu* takes the five generating numbers as its essence, and thus the five at its center also embodies the image of the five generating numbers. Its lower point is the image of Heaven’s one, one combining with four. Its left point is the image of Heaven’s three, three combining with eight. Its right point is the image of Earth’s four, four combining with nine. Its central point is the image of Heaven’s five, five combining with ten. The five numbers reside at the center, the generating numbers on the outside, and the completed numbers beyond the generating numbers. One gains five to become six, two gains five to become seven, three gains five to become eight, four gains five to become nine. One, two, three, four generate through five, hence they are called generating numbers. Six, seven, eight, nine are completed through five, hence they are called completed numbers. Though the numbers are paired, they are never without interpenetration. Thus, the *Hetu*’s fifty-five numbers are inherently contained within the five central points.\n\nThe *Luoshu* takes the odd numbers as its essence, and thus the five at its center also embodies the image of the five odd numbers. Its lower point is also the image of Heaven’s one, one paired with two. Its left point is also the image of Heaven’s three, three linked with four. Its central point is also the image of Heaven’s five, five necessarily paired with ten. Its right point is also the image of Heaven’s seven, seven linked with six. Its upper point is the image of Heaven’s nine, nine necessarily paired with eight. The five numbers reside at the center, the odd numbers occupy the cardinal directions, and the even numbers are arranged at the four corners. One gains five to become six at the rear right, two gains five to become seven at the right, three gains five to become eight at the rear left, four gains five to become nine at the front. One, three, seven, nine are the odd numbers derived from five, hence they are called odd numbers. Two, four, six, eight are the even numbers of five, hence they are called even numbers. Though the numbers crisscross vertically and horizontally, each follows its own order without confusion. Thus, the *Luoshu*’s forty-five numbers are also inherently contained within the five central points.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The old and young of yin and yang mutually conceal their abodes. He also said: The numbers seven, eight, nine, and six differ. The *Hetu* positions the numbers one, two, three, four, combining them with the images and numbers of six, seven, eight, nine. Within the forty, five contains five; within the fifteen, five connects to fifty-five—this mutual concealment was elaborated in detail by Dong Panjian. One is the position of old yang, six the number of old yin, yet within one is contained nine, already concealing the number of old yang. Four is the position of old yin, nine the number of old yang, yet within four is contained six, already concealing the number of old yin. The young two is likewise. If yin and yang did not mutually root and conceal their abodes, the mechanism of creation would cease.\n\nMoreover, seven and nine are yang. Yang governs advance: from young yang seven, advancing to the position above eight, it advances to the utmost and becomes old yang, nine, with nowhere further to go. When yang reaches its extreme, it generates yin, hence six and eight are yin. Yin governs retreat: from young yin eight, retreating to the position below seven, it retreats to the utmost and becomes old yin, six, with nowhere further to go. Thus, when yin reaches its extreme, yang is born again. The young become old, the old transform, and the young advance once more—this is the inexhaustible mechanism of creation. Yet when yang advances, it is abundant: old yang abounds at eight, young yang at six, and yang numbers are ever full.",

      "translated_text": "Yin retreats and thus is deficient: old yin is deficient at seven, young yin at nine, and yin numbers are ever diminishing. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The fullness and emptiness of Heaven and Earth wax and wane with the seasons.\" One who understands this understands the Dao.\n\nIt further states: \"The *Luoshu*’s rows and columns sum to fifteen, alternating in waxing and waning.\" The *Book of Documents* takes one, two, three, and four, containing seven, eight, nine, and six—these are called the yin and yang of the Four Images. From them, the eight trigrams of old and young arise. Their alternation in waxing and waning never departs from seven, eight, nine, and six.\n\nMaster Shao cited the *Commentary on the Changes*, saying: \"Zhen initiates growth, Qian divides, Xun diminishes, Kun contracts.\" This speaks to the general principle of waxing and waning. Thus, Zhen begins by uniting with yin to generate yang, reaching Qian’s nine where yang ages. Xun begins by diminishing yang to generate yin, reaching Kun’s six where yin ages.\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Seven grows six to nine, then divides eight to diminish nine, contracting at six.\" He also said: \"Yang’s growth proceeds from seven through eight to nine, while old yin’s diminution proceeds from eight through seven to six.\" This broadly describes the waxing and waning of a single qi, designating Zhen and Xun as seven and eight. Yet if one seeks this in the *Luoshu*’s trigram positions, Zhen is instead eight, and Xun occupies nine. Their alternation in waxing and waning is such that one plus five becomes six, alternating with the nine of the south; four plus five becomes nine, alternating with the six of the northeast. When six advances to nine, nine waxes and six wanes; when nine retreats to six, nine wanes in turn and six waxes again. Three plus five becomes eight, alternating with the seven of the west; two plus five becomes seven, alternating with the eight of the northeast. When seven advances to eight, eight waxes and seven wanes; when eight retreats to seven, eight wanes in turn and seven waxes again. Generally, numbers advance to wax and retreat to wane. What waxes retreats and wanes, and what wanes advances and waxes. The numbers of the four cardinal and four diagonal directions, whether counted horizontally or vertically, all sum to fifteen. With the central five as void, the numbers sum to ten in all directions. Dividing into ten parts, Master Zhu said: \"Nine is the remainder of one-tenth, eight of two-tenths, seven of three-tenths, six of four-tenths.\" Interweaving and interlacing, they meet without fail. Such is the union of seven, eight, nine, and six.\n\nSomeone asked Master Zhu: \"The *Hetu* does not resemble the trigrams—why did Fuxi follow it to draw the trigrams?\" In my humble opinion, the *Great Commentary* states: \"The *Changes* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams.\" This is how the Master elucidated Fuxi’s use of the *Hetu* to draw the eight trigrams. That the Supreme Ultimate is said to be \"possessed by the *Changes*\" refers to the five and ten concealed within the *Hetu*, the image of the central palace. That it \"generates the Two Modes\" refers to one, three, seven, and nine as the yang mode, and two, four, six, and eight as the yin mode. That it \"generates the Four Images\" refers to one, two, three, and four as the images of generating numbers, containing six, seven, eight, and nine as the images of completing numbers. That it \"generates the eight trigrams\" refers to seven, six, eight, and nine as the trigrams Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan, occupying the four cardinal positions, while one, two, three, and four as the trigrams Gen, Dui, Zhen, and Xun fill the four diagonal gaps. Thus, what Fuxi followed did not depart from a single diagram, yet the modes, images, and trigrams were all complete.\n\nOne is the Supreme Ultimate. Only because it exists does generation occur: one generates two, two generates four, four generates eight, and eight generates sixty-four. Generation is inexhaustible, all arising from this center.\n\nI have also heard from my teacher: \"These words are indeed the foundation of the *Changes*. But how do they function as numbers?\" He replied: \"Do not seek vague explanations—look to the beginning of Heaven and Earth, and the profound essence of the sages’ *Changes* is entirely here. One is the beginning of yang, so the sages took the single yang line to draw Qian as one, written as a single unbroken line. All trigrams belonging to yang are Qian. For example, Zhen is written as one yang over two yin, Kan as two yin over one yang, Gen as two yang over one yin—all take one as their essence. Two is the beginning of yin, so the sages took the double yin line to draw Kun as two, written as two broken lines. All trigrams belonging to yin are Kun. For example, Xun is written as two yang over one yin, Li as one yang over two yin, Dui as one yin over two yang—all take two as their essence. Thus the eight trigrams were drawn. When King Wen doubled them, he merely rearranged the lines above and below. Taking Qian’s one to exchange with Kun, Kun is transformed into Kan and placed in the north. Taking Kun’s two to exchange with Qian, Qian is transformed into Li and placed in the south. Zhen is placed in the east with one yang inside and two yin outside; Dui is placed in the west with two yang inside and one yin outside. The northwest is Qian, with three yang; the southwest is Kun, with three yin. The northeast is Gen, with two yin and one yang; the southeast is Xun, with one yin and two yang. The four cardinal and four diagonal directions are all arranged by the alternation of one and two. Fuxi drew the trigrams of the Earlier Heaven based on the *Hetu*, while King Wen followed Fuxi to expound the *Changes* of the Later Heaven. Yu bestowed the Nine Categories to first regulate the waters, and the earthly way was leveled. Jizi presented the *Great Plan*, beginning with one water and two fire, and the constant norms were established. All were derived from the numbers of Heaven as one and Earth as two.\"",

The *Luoshu* divides odd and even to distinguish yin and yang. Though divided, they are never without union; thus, within their mutual opposition, there is the subtlety of flowing transformation.\n\nWhen it speaks of \"warp and weft,\" it does not mean that above and below are the warp and left and right the weft. Rather, the warp refers to what is constant, while the weft refers to what is variable. When it speaks of \"outer and inner,\" it does not mean that this is the inner and that the outer. Rather, it means that within the *Tu* there is the *Shu*, and within the *Shu* there is the *Tu*.\n\nThe *Tu* and *Shu* mutually serve as constant and variable, depending on what is taken as primary. If the *Tu* is taken as the basis, then the *Tu* is the constant and the *Shu* the variable. If the *Shu* is taken as the basis, then the *Shu* is the constant and the *Tu* the variable. The same applies to outer and inner.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"In the numbers and positions of the *Tu* and *Shu*, three are the same while two differ.\" In the *Hetu*, one and six (water) reside in the north; two and seven (fire) in the south; three and eight (wood) in the east; four and nine (metal) in the west; five and ten (earth) in the center. These five each occupy their proper directional positions. This is the essence of the numbers, yet there is also variation therein. The *Luoshu* serves to convey this variation.\n\nIn the *Luoshu*, the positions of earth, water, and wood remain the same and do not change, for heaven-five resides in the center, generating earth as the Great Ultimate. When it first moves and emerges in the north, it becomes heaven-one generating water. When it emerges again in the east, it becomes heaven-three generating wood. This is the yang qi, which lies dormant in winter and germinates in spring. Its essence cannot be altered; it extends its roots and sprouts, speaking in terms of the inner generative numbers.\n\nAs for two and seven, which originally occupy the southern position of fire, when the season enters summer, then Qian metal generates the yang of Si, residing in the height of summer to nurture the myriad things, expanding its generative power. This is like a king emerging to preside over the Bright Hall, wielding great governance. Thus, the lesser yang of Xun and Kan, generated from two and seven, cannot but yield to the dignity of the father Qian, retreating to the west.\n\nWhen the season enters autumn, then Qian and Dui once again reside in the west, while Xun and Kan return to the south. Each follows its essence, maintaining its constancy. In general, the principle of supporting yang and restraining yin is the fundamental intent of heaven and earth to foster life.\n\nThe *Hetu* takes ten as its master, with yang in surplus and odd numbers lacking. Heaven and earth oppose each other to form its essence, and once the essence is established, its function is enacted. Thus, the *Luoshu* takes nine as its master, with odd numbers in surplus and even numbers lacking. Heaven envelops earth to enact its function. Therefore, it restrains the yin numbers, reducing them to twenty, and supports the yang completed numbers externally, so that seven and nine vary while six and eight remain unchanged.\n\nHeaven and earth embed these numbers within the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, and the sages follow them to unfold their subtleties. The discussions of earlier scholars have been thorough; I shall not repeat them here. I merely set forth my own insights.\n\n(See the extended explanation on \"one water, three wood, five earth.\")\n\nMaster Jiezhai Cai said: \"*Yi* governs images, while *Fan* governs numbers. The *Hetu* has even numbers; evenness implies mutual opposition. Thus, *Yi* is based on the two qi. The *Luoshu* has odd numbers; oddness implies flowing transformation. Thus, *Fan* is based on the Five Phases.\n\nEvenness is quiescent, and quiescence employs movement as its function; thus, the lines of the *Hetu* unite in odd numbers: one unites with six, two with seven, three with eight, four with nine, five with ten. Oddness is dynamic, and dynamism employs quiescence as its function; thus, the positions of the *Luoshu* unite in even numbers: one unites with nine, two with eight, three with seven, four with six.\n\nTherefore, in the *Yi*, good and ill fortune arise from movement, and the *Hetu* is the movement that originates from within oneself. Thus, one may perceive the subtle and anticipate good fortune; hence, it is called 'Earlier Heaven.' In the *Fan*, good and ill fortune are seen in quiescence. Quiescence is only completed through movement, so the *Luoshu* is the movement that follows heaven. One can only clarify good and ill fortune; hence, it is called 'Later Heaven.'\n\nQi has two aspects, while the phases have five. One, three, five, seven, and nine are the movements of yang. Thus, when the Master summed the five numbers of heaven, he obtained twenty-five. Two, four, six, eight, and ten are the movements of yin. Thus, when he summed the five numbers of earth, he obtained thirty.\n\nTwo cannot transform without five, and the five talents cannot act on their own without two. This speaks of how yin and yang accomplish transformation. That which enacts the spirits and gods lies in the five. The five are the Five Phases.\n\nThe fixed essence of heaven and earth’s yin-yang opposition, from one to ten, is the sequence of yin-yang’s flowing transformation. Divided into odd and even, one, three, five, seven, and nine are yang, while two, four, six, eight, and ten are yin. Arranged in order of priority, one, two, three, four, and five—the generative numbers—are yang, while six, seven, eight, nine, and ten—the completed numbers—are yin.\"",

      "translated_text": "Numbers flow within yin and yang before form is settled; images manifest within yin and yang once form is complete. The *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate, which embodies the principles of yin and yang yet remains formless. Image corresponds to yin’s stillness, while number corresponds to yang’s movement. The Supreme Ultimate is neither still nor moving, yet it governs stillness. Before the Supreme Ultimate, images and numbers cannot be distinguished by priority. Only when movement arises and yang numbers begin does the image also commence. When stillness arises and the yin image takes shape, the numbers are then completed. Yin and yang diverge and unite; movement and stillness differ. Speaking in terms of establishment: stillness is the time of dual opposition, while movement is the time of singular flow. Speaking in terms of progression: stillness is when yin and yang unite in virtue, while movement is when the two—yang leading, yin following—advance. This passage is subtly profound; readers ought to reflect deeply upon it.\n\nFu Xi based his work on the *Hetu*, first drawing the Primordial Horizontal Diagram. In the horizontal diagram, the sequence from one to eight proceeds in order, while the arrangement of trigrams runs from right to left. The numbers and the circular diagram differ—one moving in reverse, the other in sequence. Greater yang, residing in the first position, divides into Qian and Dui; lesser yin, in the second position, divides into Li and Zhen; lesser yang, in the third position, divides into Xun and Kan; greater yin, in the fourth position, divides into Gen and Kun. This proceeds from top to bottom. Then, from bottom to top and left to right: Gen and Kun emerge from greater yin’s one and six; Xun and Kan emerge from lesser yang’s two and seven; Li and Zhen emerge from lesser yin’s three and eight; Qian and Dui emerge from greater yang’s four and nine. Above the greater yang’s one, generating one odd and one even yields Qian and Dui. Above the lesser yin’s two, generating one odd and one even yields Li and Zhen. Above the lesser yang’s three, generating one odd and one even yields Xun and Kan. Above the greater yin’s four, generating one odd and one even yields Gen and Kun. This is the Primordial Horizontal Diagram. From one to eight, it serves merely as the sequence for generating trigrams.\n\nFu Xi also based his work on the *Hetu* to create the Primordial Circular Diagram. Master Zhu said: In the sixty-four-trigram horizontal diagram, Zhen, Xun, Fu, and Gou occupy the center. Folding the center to form a circular diagram, one begins from Zhen and Fu, moving backward to Qian, then proceeds from Xun and Gou forward to Kun, thus completing the circle. The sequence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as the phases of the moon—new moon, full moon, first quarter, and last quarter—and the alternation of day and night, dawn and dusk, all follow in order. This is the essential principle of diagram construction. He further stated: The horizontal diagram follows a forward sequence, while the square and circular diagrams consistently reverse direction, though the circular diagram reverses only halfway. For details, see the left and right chapters.\n\nThe Primordial Eight Trigrams align with the numbers of the *Luoshu*. The Primordial Eight Trigrams correspond to the *Luoshu*: greater yang’s nine is Qian in the due south, four is Dui in the southeast; lesser yin’s three is Li in the due east, eight is Zhen in the northeast; lesser yang’s two is Xun in the southwest, seven is Kan in the due west; greater yin’s one is Kun in the due north, six is Gen in the northwest. In the circular arrangement, Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen—four yang trigrams—occupy the left, while Xun, Kan, Gen, and Kun—four yin trigrams—occupy the right. The *Book of Documents* also places Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li at the four cardinal directions, with Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen at the four corners. The diagram and the *Book* align in their trigram positions. The difference lies in the interchange of greater yang and lesser yang in the southwest, creating variation.\n\nThe Later Heaven Eight Trigrams align with the numbers of the *Hetu*. The Later Heaven Eight Trigrams also correspond to the *Hetu*’s numbers: one and six, water and Kan, reside in the north; two and seven, fire and Li, reside in the south; three and eight, wood and Zhen, occupy the due east, while Xun occupies the southeast; four and nine, metal and Dui, occupy the due west, while Qian occupies the northwest. Five and ten—Gen at five in the northeast and Kun at ten in the southwest—permeate the central palace as earth. The Later Heaven numbers invariably align with the *Hetu*. Some, observing that two and seven reside in the south as Li, and four and nine in the northwest as Qian and Dui, mistakenly claim ten belongs to the *Luoshu*. Others, seeing nine placed in the south as Qian and two and seven in the southwest as Xun and Kan, erroneously assert nine belongs to the *Hetu*. They claim King Wen modeled this to create the Later Heaven *Yijing*, thus conflating the two diagrams and propagating Liu Mu’s theories. Scholars must be discerning.\n\nIn the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, yin and yang, odd and even, interweave. The *Hetu* combines one, two, three, and four with seven, eight, nine, and six to form ten. The *Luoshu* opposes one, two, three, and four to seven, eight, nine, and six to form ten. Ten is the product of two and five. The numbers of the two are each multiplied by five to generate and complete five. Greater yang’s position is one in the north, yet it contains nine, and its completed number lies in the west. Lesser yin’s position is two in the south, yet it contains eight, and its completed number lies in the east. Lesser yang’s position is three in the east, yet it contains seven, and its completed number lies in the south. Greater yin’s position is four in the west, yet it contains six, and its completed number lies in the north. Thus, they mutually generate and complete one another. In the *Luoshu*, however, they simply oppose each other: one opposes nine in the north and south, three opposes seven in the east and west. The four cardinal directions are thus positioned, while the four corners each form their own oppositions: the northeast corner opposes the southwest corner with two and eight, and the southeast corner opposes the northwest corner with four and six. They also interweave like warp and weft. Both the *Luoshu* and *Hetu* each conceal ten within, doubling the Five Phases to achieve completion. Master Dong’s explanation, focusing solely on the positions of the Four Images and their numbers, is also apt.",

      "translated_text": "Zhu Xi said: *The Book of Changes* was first derived by Fuxi from the *Hetu*, with no reliance on the *Luoshu*. The *Hongfan* chapter, however, was uniquely received by Yu from the *Luoshu*, without necessarily tracing back to the *Hetu*. Zheng Xuan said: The sages drew the Eight Trigrams based on the *Hetu* and arranged the Nine Categories based on the *Luoshu*. How could this be likened to drafting a circle with a compass or squaring with a carpenter’s square? There is principle in one, and there is fact in the other. When Fuxi drew the trigrams according to the *Hetu*, he did not foresee the *Luoshu*, yet their numbers coincidentally aligned. When Yu arranged the Nine Categories according to the *Luoshu*, he did not retroactively seek the numbers of the *Hetu* to match them. In my humble opinion, the positions of the *Hetu* correspond to the Primordial Heaven, while those of the *Luoshu* correspond to the Manifested Heaven. Though their positions differ in sequence, and their numbers vary between ten and nine, both are fundamentally rooted in the Five Phases, with five residing at the center—this alone is their unity.\n\nThe transmission of Master Chen Xiyi of Pu Shang: Master Xiyi, whose given name was Chuan, taught numerology to Mu Xiubozhang. Xiubozhang taught Li Zhicai, and Zhicai taught Shao Kangjie, who then composed the *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Xiubozhang also transmitted the *Taiji Diagram* to Zhou Dunyi. Zhu Hanshang said: Dunyi taught the Cheng brothers. At that time, Zhang Zai lectured among the Cheng brothers and Shao Yong. Thus, Dunyi wrote the *Comprehensive Treatise*, Cheng Yi composed the *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, and Zhang Zai authored the *Great Harmony* in three sections. He also taught Xiang Zong on symbolic studies, and Zong taught Xu Jian of Lujiang—this branch was transmitted in the south.\n\nSome say the two diagrams of the Primordial Heaven (square and circular) originated from Ma Shi’s enlightenment. Zhu Xi clarified this was not so, stating that the diagrams were all created by Fuxi, containing only trigrams without words or text. After the passing of Confucius and Mencius, they were concealed by esoteric practitioners, only to be transmitted by Xiyi.\n\nCai Xishan said: The images of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were described as such by Han scholars Kong Anguo and Liu Xiang, Wei scholar Guan Lang Ziming, and Song masters Shao Kangjie and Shao Yaofu. It was Liu Mu who first reversed their names, and later scholars followed suit. Thus, they are now restored to their original designations. Ancient records, from Kong Anguo, Liu Xiang and his son Liu Xin, to Ban Gu, all state that the *Hetu* was bestowed upon Fuxi and the *Luoshu* upon Yu. Guan Ziming and Shao Kangjie both identified ten as the *Hetu* and nine as the *Luoshu*. The numbers of the Nine Palaces—nine atop, one below, three on the left, seven on the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet—precisely mirror the pattern of a turtle’s shell.\n\nZhu Xi said: Reading the *Book of Rites* by Dai the Elder yields one clear piece of evidence. Its *Mingtang* chapter contains the phrase “two, nine, four, seven, five, three, six, eight, one.” Zheng’s commentary states: “This follows the pattern of a turtle’s markings.” Thus, the Han scholars indeed took nine as the *Luoshu*. Why then did Liu Mu, with his peculiar views, reverse this, taking nine as the *Hetu* and ten as the *Luoshu*, completely overturning the teachings of earlier scholars? He falsely claimed his diagrams originated from Xiyi, lacking any written record, and that Xu Jian transmitted them to Kuang Chang, who then passed them to Liu Mu. Many adopted his theory, spreading it widely. Later, Zhu Hanshang composed his *Commentary on the Book of Changes*, and Zhang Xingcheng of Shu wrote the *Seven Eases*. Others, like Zheng of Puyang, all followed Liu’s interpretation, none of which had been corrected before. Only with the emergence of Master Zhu and Cai Yijun of Xishan were these errors rectified, restoring ten as the *Hetu* and nine as the *Luoshu*. The world came to trust this. Yet Liu Mu’s theory should not be entirely dismissed.\n\nHere, I cite a few points: He quoted the *Great Commentary*, asserting that both originated in Fuxi’s time, not that they were bestowed upon him. Had later generations not seen the text of the thirteen hexagrams in the *Appended Judgments*, they might have attributed the sixty-four hexagrams solely to King Wen. Had they not seen the text of the *Hongfan*’s heavenly bestowal, they might have assumed the Nine Categories were arranged by Jizi. How would they know that the selection of *Yu* and *Guai* was already present before King Wen composed the hexagrams, or that the offices of Minister of Education and Minister of Works were established on the day Yu received the Nine Palaces? Thus, the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* both existed in high antiquity; Fuxi merely drew them, and Yu modeled and arranged them accordingly. In my view, this argument is not without merit. However, to claim the *Luoshu* did not emerge during Yu’s flood control contradicts the statement that “Heaven bestowed upon Yu the *Hongfan* Nine Categories.”\n\nRecently, in the Xinwei imperial examination, Liu Mengjian employed this theory. Though he ranked first in the southern palace, many who followed Master Zhu’s interpretation of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were placed behind him. He further argued that the *Yu Gong* speaks of the *Luo* as a path but does not mention obtaining the *Luoshu*, and the *Canon of Shun* refers to “favoring categories” without specifying the Nine Categories. The phrase “Heaven bestowed upon Yu” merely means Heaven inspired him. Liu Mu also said: The fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth are forty-five in the *Hetu*, leaving ten unused. This is because the four corners and four cardinal directions each combine to form ten. Adding the central five, both vertically and horizontally, sums to fifteen, totaling fifty-five. The five is unused because: Heaven’s one plus five makes six, Earth’s two plus five makes seven, Heaven’s three plus five makes eight, Earth’s four plus five makes nine, and Heaven’s five plus five makes ten. Thus it is said: “Earth completes the ten.”",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the numbers of the Eight Trigrams total thirty-six. The nine unused numbers arise because *Qian* and *Kun* each bear the number nine, *Zhen* and *Xun* each bear the number nine, and *Kan*, *Li*, *Gen*, and *Dui* all bear the number nine. Why then doubt that the nine numbers cannot form the *Hetu*, or that the ten numbers cannot form the *Luoshu*? The four cardinal directions are all odd and yang, while the four corners are all even and yin. As the saying goes: “Solitary yin does not generate, solitary yang does not complete,” and only when one odd and one even are paired does creation arise.\n\nIt is further said: The number one, as a numerical value, is one in Heaven and *jia* in the celestial stems. As an image, it is the central number of six; as a trigram, it is the central line of *Kan*. In doubled trigrams, it is the *initial nine*; in *Fu*, it is the yang line; in the earthly branches, it is *jianzi*; among the Five Phases, it is Water; in the twelve pitch-pipes, it is *Huangzhong*. One is the fixed position. Subtract one from fifty, and one resides within forty-nine. Subtract one again from forty-nine, and one resides within forty-eight. Wherever there are numbers, one is never absent. Wherever one is present, it is invariably the ancestor of the myriad things. To grasp this without fail is to hold the mechanism of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis reasoning is rather sound. I have recorded these discussions at the conclusion of the section on images and numbers to show that such theories flourished alongside the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* in their time, differing only in their inversion and misplacement. Scholars ought not remain ignorant of this.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Thirteen, concludes here.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Fourteen\nBy Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai\nCollated and Corrected by Fang Wanli of Xugu",

      "translated_text": "The discourse on \"prior and posterior\" (先天后天) was refined through the contributions of the Four Sages and Four Worthies before its theory reached completion. The Four Sages are: Fu Xi, who drew the trigrams in the *prior Heaven* arrangement; King Wen, who expanded the *Yijing*, and the Duke of Zhou, who composed the line statements—both in the *posterior Heaven* arrangement; and Confucius, whose Ten Wings encompass both *prior* and *posterior Heaven*. The Four Worthies are: Han Yu of the Han, Cheng Shuzhi, Shaozi (Shao Yong), who alone expounded the learning of *prior Heaven*, and Master Zhu (Zhu Xi), who synthesized them into one. Thus, the Dao of the *Yijing* was greatly illuminated for the world. Without the successive efforts of the Four Sages and Four Worthies, the world would still grope in darkness.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Kangjie (Shao Yong) had a poem:\n*\"If one speaks of the prior Heaven, there is nothing at all;\nThe posterior Heaven is where effort must be applied.\"*\nHe also said:\n*\"The Will of Heaven is nothing but spontaneity;\nBeyond spontaneity, there is no Heaven.\"*\nThis conveys the same meaning.\n\nMaster Pan said: *\"The prior Heaven is nothing at all\"*—I arrived at this understanding through the investigation of things. In my youth, I observed chicks hatching from their eggs. At first, they did not peck. Only when their *qi* and allotted time were sufficient did they burst forth, breaking the shell. If one were to assist them even slightly, the chick would emerge weak and fail to thrive. From this, I saw that there is not the slightest room for human interference.\n\nI say: One, two, three, four, five are the generating numbers of Heaven and Earth—this is *prior Heaven*. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten are the completing numbers of Heaven and Earth—this is *posterior Heaven*. Some ask: Is *wuji* becoming *taiji* the *prior Heaven*? Is *taiji* becoming yin and yang the *posterior Heaven*? By analogy, the unmanifest center is *prior Heaven*, while its manifestation in harmony is *posterior Heaven*. The opening of things is *prior Heaven*; their completion is *posterior Heaven*. Uprightness and origin are *prior Heaven*; smoothness and benefit are *posterior Heaven*. Yet even within uprightness, there is a *prior* and *posterior*: the first half of *zi* (子) pertains to yin and is *prior Heaven*, while the latter half pertains to yang and is *posterior Heaven*. *Prior* and *posterior Heaven* apply to all affairs and all things. In silent observation, one grasps more than half the truth—how could this be limited to the arrangement of trigrams alone?\n\nMaster Cai said: Cold and heat, day and night, the yin and yang of living things—all undergo contraction and expansion, growth and decline. This is *prior Heaven*. That by which yang is yang is its ceaseless movement without fixed form. The *qi* and form, the hun and po of living things—here, yang can transform while yin cannot. This is *posterior Heaven*. That by which yin is yin is its stillness with fixed form. Fu Xi’s trigrams are *prior Heaven*—the *qi* of Heaven. King Wen’s trigrams are *posterior Heaven*—the things of Earth. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states: *\"To precede Heaven and not violate it is the movement of unified will and *qi*. To follow Heaven and accord with its seasons is the movement of unified *qi* and will.\"* Master Hengqu (Zhang Zai) said: *Qi* and will, Heaven and humanity—there is mutual overcoming in their alternation. In the *Yijing*, every word and meaning flows from this.\n\nSomeone asked: How do the *Taiji* and *Prior Heaven* diagrams compare? Master Zhu said: In terms of their structure, the *Taiji* diagram is not as vast as the *Prior Heaven* diagram. Yet in detailed discussion of their principles, the *Prior Heaven* diagram is not as refined and concise as the *Taiji* diagram. Nevertheless, the *Taiji* ultimately lies within the scope of the *Prior Heaven*. What Shaozi called the learning of *prior Heaven* begins from the moment before a single line is drawn and extends to the completion of the six lines. For example, in Confucius’ Ten Wings, passages such as *\"The eight trigrams are arrayed\"* and *\"The Supreme Polarity generates the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams\"*—Heaven and Earth, thunder and wind, mountain and marsh, water and fire—all derive from Fu Xi’s original trigrams. Before the *prior Heaven* trigrams were drawn, no principle was yet divided. First, one yang and one yin line generate two single lines. Above the Two Modes, each generates one yang and one yin, producing four two-line images. Above the Four Images, each generates one yang and one yin, producing eight three-line trigrams. All arise naturally, without contrivance, and become clear without the need for words or discourse. This is the guiding principle of *Yijing* studies, the first essential truth at the opening of the text. From ancient times until now, none have recognized it—until Kangjie (Shao Yong) transmitted its teaching. This is the *Yijing* of *prior Heaven*.\n\nIt is also said: Fu Xi’s four diagrams, as expounded by the Shao lineage, were created when he first drew the trigrams. First, he made the horizontal diagram of the eight trigrams, then the horizontal diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams. Next, he made the circular diagram of the eight trigrams’ positions, followed by the circular diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams’ positions.\n\nIt is further said: In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, the outer circle represents Heaven, and the inner square represents Earth. Master Cai Xishan said: In the circular arrangement of the sixty-four hexagrams, *Qian* culminates at noon, *Kun* at midnight, *Li* at dawn, and *Kan* at dusk. Yang is born at midnight and reaches its peak at noon; yin is born at noon and reaches its peak at midnight. Yang resides in the south, yin in the north. In the square arrangement, *Qian* begins in the northwest, and *Kun* ends in the southeast. Here, yang is in the north, yin in the south. These two arrangements represent the numerical correspondence of yin and yang. The outer circle is yang, the inner square is yin. The circle moves and is Heaven; the square is still and is Earth. In the circular diagram, *Qian* is in the south and *Kun* in the north. In the square diagram, *Kun* is in the south and *Qian* in the north. The position of *Qian* has more yang lines; the position of *Kun* has more yin lines. Yin and yang each gather according to their kind. The diagram encloses the square within the circle, illustrating that Heaven envelops Earth externally while Earth resides within Heaven. Master Zhu said: The square and circle are especially wondrous.\n\nShaozi had a poem:\n*\"Heaven and Earth take their positions, *Pi* and *Tai* reverse their categories.\nMountain and marsh exchange *qi*, *Xian* and *Sun* reveal their meaning.\nThunder and wind press upon each other, *Heng* and *Yi* arise in intent.\nWater and fire shoot forth, *Jiji* and *Weiji* are achieved.\nThe Four Images intersect, completing sixteen affairs.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The eight trigrams interact to form sixty-four. Master Zhu explained: \"This elucidates the two intersecting legs of the square and circle diagrams. In the northwest corner stands *Qian*; in the northeast corner, *Kun*—this is Heaven and Earth taking their positions. Opposite them lie *Tai* in the northeast and *Pi* in the southwest. Next to *Qian* is *Dui*; next to *Kun* is *Gen*—this is mountain and marsh exchanging *qi*. Opposite them are *Xian* from *Pi* and *Sun* from *Tai*. The remaining four trigrams follow likewise. Next to *Dui* is *Li*; next to *Gen* is *Kan*—this is water and fire shooting forth. Opposite them are *Jiji* from *Sun* and *Weiji* from *Xian*. Next to *Li* is *Zhen*; next to *Kan* is *Xun*, positioned at the central intersection of the two legs—this is thunder and wind pressing upon each other. Opposite them are *Yi* from *Jiji* and *Heng* from *Weiji*. The Four Images intersect to complete sixteen affairs, precisely because *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Pi* and *Tai*, *Gen* and *Dui* into *Sun* and *Xian*, *Zhen* and *Xun* into *Sun* and *Yi*, and *Kan* and *Li* into *Jiji* and *Weiji*. Each set of four trigrams stands in mutual opposition, exhausting the square of Earth.\"\n\nHe further stated: \"In the *Prior Heaven* circular diagram, four sets of sixteen hexagrams reside externally. In the square diagram, four sets of sixteen hexagrams reside internally. The first sixteen are born of *Qian* and *Kun*; the next sixteen, of *Gen* and *Dui*; the following sixteen, of *Kan* and *Li*; and the last sixteen, of *Zhen* and *Xun*. These four sets of sixteen pairs together complete the square and circular diagrams. The circular diagram represents the yin and yang of the Dao of Heaven. In Heaven, they manifest as the sun, moon, stars, heat, cold, day, and night—termed the *Yi* of ceaseless flow, for it moves with Heaven and Earth through the four seasons without pause. The thirty-two yang hexagrams on the left govern spring’s generation and summer’s growth; the thirty-two yin hexagrams on the right govern autumn’s gathering and winter’s storage. Together, they quadruple the sixteen to form sixty-four hexagrams. Divided by spring, summer, autumn, and winter, each season further quadruples the sixty-four to yield 1,536 hexagram lines of *qi*, circulating through Heaven. The Four Images establish form, the six *jia* cycles revolve, revealing the governance of emperors, kings, and lords near and far. The 366-day rotation is presided over by *Qian* and *Kun*, belonging to Heaven’s creative transformations.\"\n\n\"The square diagram represents the yielding and firmness of the Dao of Earth. On Earth, they manifest as water, fire, soil, stone, rain, wind, dew, and thunder—termed the *Yi* of mutual opposition, for it follows Heaven’s seasons to generate and transform. The inner section of thirty-two yang hexagrams spans from *Qian* in the northwest to *Tai* in the northeast; the outer section of thirty-two yin hexagrams spans from *Pi* in the southwest to *Kun* in the southeast. These also quadruple the sixteen to form sixty-four hexagrams. Divided by *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*, each further quadruples the sixty-four to yield 256 positions of hexagram bodies, giving rise to beings on Earth. The Four Images establish form, the four nines serve as function, revealing the yang chant and yin response of pitch pipes and sounds, the birth and death of creatures moving and still. *Kan* and *Li* preside, belonging to Earth’s creative transformations.\"\n\nThus, Quezi said: \"Sixteen is the number derived from the Four Images’ mutual dependence. All transformations of Heaven and Earth, all resonances of the myriad things, all continuities and changes, gains and losses of past and present—none lie beyond sixteen. With sixteen, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete. Herein lies the opening and closing, waxing and waning, fortune and misfortune, good and evil, each paired in perfect opposition without discrepancy.\"\n\nIn the *Posterior Heaven* *Upper Canon*, eighteen hexagrams reverse their opposites, twelve of which are mutable, while six remain immutable: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Yi*, and *Daguo*. In the *Lower Canon*, eighteen hexagrams reverse their opposites, sixteen of which are mutable, while two remain immutable: *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo*. The *Yi Wei* states: \"The sixty-four hexagrams of the *Yi* are divided by King Wen into the *Upper* and *Lower Canons*.\" Examining the *Sequence of Hexagrams*, all follow the *Posterior Heaven* order, with reversed opposing hexagrams. Of the eight trigrams, four remain immutable: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. Two reverse: *Zhen* and *Dui*. *Zhen* reverses to *Gen*, *Dui* reverses to *Xun*. Thus, six trigrams transform into eight, and through doubling, the additional hexagrams *Yi*, *Zhongfu*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo* emerge. Four hexagrams remain unchanged: *Tai* above, and *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* as the eight trigrams. Twenty-eight hexagrams undergo reversal and mutation. Eight paired with eight yield thirty-six transformations, completing the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\n*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* remain fundamentally immutable, while *Gen* and *Zhen* combine to form *Yi*; *Zhen* and *Gen* combine to form *Xiaoguo*; *Xun* and *Dui* combine to form *Zhongfu*; *Dui* and *Xun* combine to form *Daguo*—all likewise immutable. Though the eight trigrams remain immutable, when *Qian* fully transforms, it becomes *Kun*; when *Kun* fully transforms, it becomes *Qian*. When *Kan* fully transforms, it becomes *Li*; when *Li* fully transforms, it becomes *Kan*. The full transformations of *Yi* and *Daguo*, *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* follow the same pattern.\"\n\nMaster Li said: \"The *Upper* and *Lower Canons* each pair opposites. The *Sequence of Hexagrams* shifts its literary meaning at *Kan* and *Li*, establishing the *Canons* with *Qian* and *Kun* as the two elders standing in opposition, each concealing their names in the sequence. The *Lower Canon* begins with *Xian*, the two youths united in form, yet the sequence uniquely conceals the name *Xian*. *Xu* and *Song* in the *Upper Canon* oppose *Jin* and *Mingyi* in the *Lower Canon*. When *Xu* and *Song* fully transform, they become *Jin*; when *Jin* fully transforms, it becomes *Xu*. *Tai* and *Pi* in the *Upper Canon* oppose *Sun* and *Yi* in the *Lower Canon*. *Tai* and *Pi* arise from the exchange of *Qian* and *Kun*; *Sun* and *Yi* do not exchange. *Xian* and *Heng* exchange, yet do not exchange. In the *Upper Canon*, from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Lin* and *Guan*; in the *Lower Canon*, from *Dun* and *Zhuang* to *Ge* and *Ding*. When *Zhun* and *Meng* fully transform, they become *Ding* and *Ge*; when *Lin* and *Guan* fully transform, they become *Dun* and *Zhuang*. *Yi* and *Daguo* in the *Upper Canon* appear paired before *Kan* and *Li*; *Zhongfu* and *Xiaoguo* in the *Lower Canon* appear paired before *Jiji* and *Weiji*.

      "original_text": "既未#15者，即坎离之交。 不交也，颐似离，大过似坎，而坎离继二卦后。 中孚厚画，离小过厚画。 坎而既未济又继二卦后，是坎离为乾坤震巽艮兑之用。 上经五十二阳爻，五十六阴爻。 下经五十六阳爻，五．十二阴爻。 经分上下，皆有至理。 惜师说不传，而文王分经之义隐矣。 邵子曰：乾坤纵而六子横，《易》之本也。 又曰：震兑横而六卦纵，《易》之用也。 先天八卦，以乾坤为《易》之本，而六子辅之。 故六子皆为横，而乾坤独为纵。 纵如织之有经，横如经之有纬。 分阴分阳，错综以纬之也。 乾坤居南北，以定上天下地之位。 乾有二十六阳十二阴，坤有三十六阴十二阳。 既有以植天地之经，而分南北矣。 於是离东坎西为日月以为之纬。 艮西北对兑东南，震东北对巽西南。 又为山泽雷风之变以为纬焉。 益巽离兑阴卦也，而本乾体反多阳。 故取其阳之多，以为乾之纬於左。 震艮坎阳卦也，而本坤体反多阴。 故取其阴之多，以为坤之纬於右。 上下相应，一纵一横。 阳奇阴偶，相为对待。 所以立《易》之体，而以后天为用。 后天八卦，以震兑为《易》之用，六卦辅之。 故六卦皆为纵，而震兑独为横。 横如秤之有衡，而六卦为衡上之星。 或轻或重，进退以权之也。 震兑位束西，以秉春生秋杀之权。 震以一阳，而生巽离兑之六阳。 积而为乾，以居西北，而成父道之尊。 震又以二阴而函巽离兑之三阴。 并六阴为坤，以居束南，而成母道之善。 束生西成，一横六纵。 以横为重，震兑木金，各当其位。 坎离水火，交致其用。 此后天八卦，所以为地上之《易》，应人之用也。 或曰：后天八卦，震兑坎离，居东西南北之正位。 而相对者，取其交也。 乾坤艮巽，居东西南北之偏处。 而不相对者，为其不交也。 交者为用，则不交者不用也。 今子以阴阳数推之，皆为有用，何也？ 曰：有四正卦以用之，则四隅不用之，卦皆入有用之中矣。 张氏曰：先天八卦应天四时，后天八卦应地八方。 何往而非用者。 邵子曰：先天《易》之体，后天《易》之用。 先天用坎离日月，为刚柔昼夜之变。 后天用乾坤九六，为阴阳寒暑之变。 先天《易》之体应天之气，后天《易》之用应地之方。 先天卦位八正，乾南坤北离束坎西兼颐孚大小过。 后天卦气，四正坎离震兑，四维乾坤艮巽。 先天乾坤分天地，以定上下之位。 后天乾坤为大父母，退居西北西南之维。 先天坎离为日月，列卯酉左右之门。 后天坎离为水火，分南北生出之序。 先天八卦，造物之初，兼天上地下，乾坤阖辟，日月出入，春夏秋冬，弦望晦朔，昼夜长短，行度盈缩，莫不由此。 后天八卦，生物之后，独攘地上，而言坎离。 当二至中，震兑位当二八之造而有定，非若昼夜之盈缩也。 故《系辞》言春夏秋冬南北束西，而坤不过言地，坎不过言水而已，初不及乎地下之事也。 先天以阴生阳，后天以阳生阴。 先天四象生日月，故阳抱阴生日，阴抱阳生月。 后天日月生万物，故阳行阳中万物盈，阳行阴中万物缩。 先天言日月五星，皆从天左行。 后天言日月五星，皆违天右行。 先天用四象，水火土石。 后天用五行，木火土金水。 先天左三十二阳，析归妹一卦，分兑居上震居下。",
      "translated_text": "*Jiji* and *Weiji* are the intermingling of *Kan* and *Li*. Yet they do not intermingle. *Yi* resembles *Li*, and *Daguo* resembles *Kan*, yet *Kan* and *Li* follow these two hexagrams. *Zhongfu* has thick lines, and *Xiaoguo* has thick lines like *Li*. *Kan* and *Jiji/Weiji* again follow these two hexagrams, for *Kan* and *Li* serve as the function of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Dui*.\n\nThe *Upper Canon* contains fifty-two yang lines and fifty-six yin lines. The *Lower Canon* contains fifty-six yang lines and fifty-two yin lines. The division of the *Canon* into upper and lower sections follows a profound principle. It is regrettable that the master’s teachings were not transmitted, and the meaning behind King Wen’s division of the *Canon* has become obscure.\n\nMaster Shao said: *Qian* and *Kun* run vertically while the Six Children run horizontally—this is the root of the *Yi*. He also said: *Zhen* and *Dui* run horizontally while the six hexagrams run vertically—this is the function of the *Yi*.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven* arrangement of the eight hexagrams, *Qian* and *Kun* are the root of the *Yi*, with the Six Children assisting them. Thus, the Six Children are all horizontal, while *Qian* and *Kun* alone are vertical. The vertical is like the warp in weaving, and the horizontal like the weft. Dividing yin and yang, they interlace to form the weft. *Qian* and *Kun* occupy the south and north to establish the positions of heaven above and earth below. *Qian* has twenty-six yang lines and twelve yin lines; *Kun* has thirty-six yin lines and twelve yang lines. Thus, they plant the warp of heaven and earth, dividing south and north. Then *Li* in the east and *Kan* in the west serve as the sun and moon to form the weft. *Gen* in the northwest opposes *Dui* in the southeast, and *Zhen* in the northeast opposes *Xun* in the southwest—these further serve as the transformations of mountains and marshes, thunder and wind to form the weft.\n\nMoreover, *Xun*, *Li*, *Dui* are yin hexagrams, yet their root in *Qian*’s body paradoxically yields more yang. Thus, their abundance of yang is taken as *Qian*’s weft on the left. *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Kan* are yang hexagrams, yet their root in *Kun*’s body paradoxically yields more yin. Thus, their abundance of yin is taken as *Kun*’s weft on the right. Above and below correspond, one vertical and one horizontal. Yang is odd, yin is even—they stand in mutual opposition. This establishes the structure of the *Yi*, while the *Later Heaven* arrangement serves its function.\n\nIn the *Later Heaven* arrangement of the eight hexagrams, *Zhen* and *Dui* serve as the function of the *Yi*, with the six hexagrams assisting them. Thus, the six hexagrams are all vertical, while *Zhen* and *Dui* alone are horizontal. The horizontal is like the beam of a scale, and the six hexagrams are the stars on the beam. Some are light, some are heavy—they advance and retreat to weigh them. *Zhen* and *Dui* occupy east and west to hold the power of spring’s generation and autumn’s harvest. *Zhen*, with its single yang, generates the six yang of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. Accumulating, they become *Qian*, which resides in the northwest to complete the honor of the father’s way. *Zhen* also contains two yin, which enfold the three yin of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. Combining the six yin, they become *Kun*, which resides in the southeast to complete the goodness of the mother’s way. The east generates, the west completes—one horizontal, six vertical. The horizontal is weighted, with *Zhen* as wood and *Dui* as metal, each in its proper place. *Kan* as water and *Li* as fire intermingle to fulfill their function. This is how the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams serve as the *Yi* of the earth’s surface, responding to human use.\n\nSomeone asked: In the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams, *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Kan*, and *Li* occupy the cardinal positions of east, west, south, and north, and their oppositions are taken for their intermingling. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* occupy the intermediate positions of east, west, south, and north, and their lack of opposition means they do not intermingle. If intermingling serves a function, then non-intermingling serves no function. Yet when I examine this through the numbers of yin and yang, all seem to serve a function—why is this?\n\nThe answer: With the four cardinal hexagrams serving their function, the four corner hexagrams do not serve theirs—yet all hexagrams enter into what serves a function.\n\nMaster Zhang said: The *Former Heaven* eight hexagrams correspond to heaven’s four seasons; the *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams correspond to earth’s eight directions. Where do they not serve a function?\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Former Heaven* *Yi* is its structure; the *Later Heaven* *Yi* is its function. The *Former Heaven* employs *Kan* and *Li* as the sun and moon for the transformations of firmness and softness, day and night. The *Later Heaven* employs *Qian* and *Kun*’s nine and six for the transformations of yin and yang, cold and heat. The *Former Heaven* *Yi*’s structure responds to heaven’s qi; the *Later Heaven* *Yi*’s function responds to earth’s directions. The *Former Heaven* hexagram positions are eightfold and cardinal: *Qian* in the south, *Kun* in the north, *Li* in the east, *Kan* in the west, along with *Yi*, *Zhongfu*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo*. The *Later Heaven* hexagram qi are fourfold and cardinal: *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Dui*; the four corners are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, *Qian* and *Kun* divide heaven and earth to establish the positions of above and below. In the *Later Heaven*, *Qian* and *Kun* become the great father and mother, retiring to the northwest and southwest corners. In the *Former Heaven*, *Kan* and *Li* are the sun and moon, arrayed at the gates of *mao* and *you* on the left and right. In the *Later Heaven*, *Kan* and *Li* are water and fire, dividing south and north in the sequence of generation and emergence. The *Former Heaven* eight hexagrams mark the beginning of creation, encompassing heaven above and earth below—*Qian* and *Kun*’s opening and closing, the sun and moon’s rising and setting, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, waxing and waning, dark and new moons, the lengthening and shortening of day and night, the degrees of celestial motion, and the waxing and waning of the seasons—all arise from this. The *Later Heaven* eight hexagrams mark the time after the generation of beings, concerning only the earth’s surface, and thus speak of *Kan* and *Li*. They stand at the solstices, while *Zhen* and *Dui* occupy the fixed positions of the second and eighth months—unlike the waxing and waning of day and night. Thus, the *Appended Judgments* speak of spring, summer, autumn, winter, south, north, east, and west, yet *Kun* speaks only of earth, and *Kan* only of water, never touching upon what lies beneath the earth.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, yin generates yang; in the *Later Heaven*, yang generates yin. In the *Former Heaven*, the four images generate the sun and moon, so yang embraces yin to generate the sun, and yin embraces yang to generate the moon. In the *Later Heaven*, the sun and moon generate the ten thousand things, so when yang moves through yang, the ten thousand things flourish; when yang moves through yin, the ten thousand things contract. In the *Former Heaven*, the sun, moon, and five stars all move left with heaven. In the *Later Heaven*, the sun, moon, and five stars all move right against heaven. The *Former Heaven* employs the four images: water, fire, earth, and stone. The *Later Heaven* employs the five phases: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. In the *Former Heaven*, the thirty-two yang on the left are divided from the hexagram *Guimei*, with *Dui* above and *Zhen* below.",

      "translated_text": "In the *Later Heaven*, *Zhen* (☳) is east and *Dui* (☱) is west, with *Qian* (☰) extending to *Guimei* (䷵) in twelve steps, counting twenty-one hexagrams from below to above. In the *Former Heaven*, the thirty-two yin on the right are divided from the hexagram *Jian* (䷴), with *Xun* (☴) above and *Gen* (☶) below. In the *Later Heaven*, *Gen* (☶) is above and *Xun* (☴) is below, with *Kun* (☷) extending to *Jian* (䷴) in twelve steps, counting thirty-one hexagrams from below to above.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, one hexagram transforms into seven, with one as the root and seven as its function. In the *Later Heaven*, one hexagram transforms into six, with the hexagram as the root and the lines as its function. In the *Former Heaven*, two and three are the numbers of change, totaling forty-two. In the *Later Heaven*, three and two are the numbers of extension, totaling fifty.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, *Qian* (☰), *Dui* (☱), *Li* (☲), and *Zhen* (☳) are the four yang hexagrams, belonging to Heaven with eight yang and four yin. *Xun* (☴), *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Kun* (☷) are the four yin hexagrams, belonging to Earth with eight yin and four yang. Their numbers are unequal. In the *Later Heaven*, *Qian* (☰), *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Zhen* (☳) are the four yang hexagrams—one father and three sons—with six yin and six yang. *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), *Kun* (☷), and *Dui* (☱) are the four yin hexagrams—one mother and three daughters—with six yin and six yang. Their numbers are equal. *Kun* (☷), *Dui* (☱), *Qian* (☰), and *Kan* (☵) reside in the southwest and north, while *Gen* (☶), *Zhen* (☳), *Xun* (☴), and *Li* (☲) reside in the northeast and southeast, likewise.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the beginning of generation and flourishing starts with the winter solstice as the first of the first. In the *Later Heaven*, the beginning of the generation of things starts with the spring equinox as the first of the second. In the *Former Heaven*, Heaven’s two primary hexagrams are *Qian* (☰) and *Li* (☲), combined with *Yi* (䷚) and *Zhongfu* (䷼), doubling the hexagrams to form Heaven’s four primary hexagrams. *Yi* (䷚) resembles *Li* (☲), and *Zhongfu* (䷼) thickens the line of *Li* (☲). In the *Later Heaven*, Earth’s two primary hexagrams are *Kun* (☷) and *Kan* (☵), combined with *Daguo* (䷛) and *Xiaoguo* (䷽), doubling the hexagrams to form Earth’s four primary hexagrams. *Daguo* (䷛) resembles *Kan* (☵), and *Xiaoguo* (䷽) thickens the line of *Kan* (☵).\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the three palaces of *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱) each contain twenty-eight yang. The three palaces of *Kan* (☵), *Gen* (☶), and *Zhen* (☳) each contain twenty-eight yin. In the *Later Heaven*, *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶) have six yang and twelve yin, while *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱) have six yin and twelve yang. The *Upper Canon*’s *Qian* (☰), *Kun* (☷), *Kan* (☵), and *Li* (☲) are the ancestors of thirty-six hexagrams, while the *Lower Canon*’s *Dui* (☱), *Zhen* (☳), *Xun* (☴), and *Gen* (☶) are the ancestors of twenty-eight hexagrams.\n\nIn the *Former Heaven*, the greater is employed for governance. The three daughters originally embody *Qian* (☰) and follow their father to the southeast. The three sons originally embody *Kun* (☷) and follow their mother to the northwest. In the *Later Heaven*, the lesser is employed for function. The three sons follow their father to the northeast, and the three daughters follow their mother to the southwest.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Later Heaven* is the present *Zhouyi*, as arranged by King Wen. After Confucius composed the *Ten Wings* for King Wen’s *Yi*, his discussions should take the *Zhouyi* as primary. Yet without tracing back to Fu Xi’s original drawing of the hexagrams, scholars will surely mistake King Wen’s arrangement for Fu Xi’s original *Yi*, beginning their explanations from the middle and failing to recognize the root source above. Fu Xi’s *Former Heaven Yi* was expanded by King Wen into the *Zhouyi*, which is the study of the *Later Heaven*. Thus, the canon is divided into upper and lower sections: thirty hexagrams in the upper and thirty-four in the lower. Confucius then composed the *Ten Wings* for it, further dividing them into six parts—*Xiang* (Images), *Xici* (Appended Judgments), each with upper and lower sections—and four additional parts: *Wenyan* (seven), *Shuogua* (eight), *Xugua* (nine), and *Zagua* (ten).\n\nTo \"begin explanations from the middle\" means only to know King Wen’s restoration of the *Yi*. One must further study Fu Xi’s *Former Heaven Yi* to thoroughly grasp the root source above. Master Zhu said: The *Former Heaven* and *Later Heaven* each have their own meanings, but the *Later Heaven* contains more interpretive principles. They do not conflict, and one must not cling to one while abandoning the rest. He also said: In the *Later Heaven*, ten hexagrams discuss hexagram transformation, while nine explain the origins of hexagram formation. Whenever the *Xiang* (Image) commentary does not explain the origin of a hexagram’s formation, it does not mention the changing line.\n\nNow, observing the *Yi Commentaries*, we see that Shao Kangjie’s theories on the *Former Heaven* and *Later Heaven* are most insightful. Combining the explanations of Masters Zhu and Cai, we say: Master Cheng focused solely on *Qian* (☰) and *Kun* (☷) when discussing hexagram transformation, which works for hexagrams with upper and lower bodies that can transform, such as *Gu* (䷑), *Xian* (䷞), *Da* (䷎), and *Jian* (䷴). However, it does not apply to hexagrams that transform as a whole, such as *Song* (䷅), *Yu* (䷆), *Meng* (䷃), and *Shi* (䷆). To say that yang comes from outside is problematic. The *Cheng Commentary* on the hexagram *Ze* (䷔) asks: How could *Qian* and *Kun* transform into *Tai* (䷊), and then *Tai* transform into *Ze*? If so, then *Qian* and *Kun* transforming into the six children, and the eight trigrams doubling into sixty-four hexagrams, would all derive from *Qian* and *Kun*. Such an explanation does not hold.\n\nIf *Zhen* (☳) obtains a son through the first line, and the following six hexagrams are already formed, then the meanings derived from these hexagrams belong to the *Later Heaven*. The so-called hexagram transformations also occur after the hexagrams exist. The sages perceived these images and thus expounded them in the *Xiang* (Image) commentary. How could one claim that *Qian* and *Kun* transformed into them? Master Cai of Jiezhai said: Hexagram transformations are all composed of three yang and three yin, inherently possessing the principles of *Qian* and *Kun*, with upper and lower interactions. *Qian*’s firmness intermingles with *Kun* to form *Zhen* (☳), *Kan* (☵), and *Gen* (☶), while *Kun*’s softness intermingles with *Qian* to form *Xun* (☴), *Li* (☲), and *Dui* (☱). When it speaks of \"firmness coming\" or \"firmness descending,\" it clarifies that *Qian* is above and descends to interact with *Kun*. When it speaks of \"softness coming\" or \"softness descending,\" it means *Kun* is above and descends to interact with *Qian*. If it speaks of \"above\" in relation to \"softness ascending,\" then it reverses: *Qian*’s firmness is below and ascends to interact with *Kun*, while *Kun*’s softness is below and ascends to interact with *Qian*. All these derive from the mutual interactions of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nAs for *Song* (䷅) and *Yu* (䷆), which only mention \"firmness coming\" and \"firmness coming from outside,\" these hexagrams have four yang and two yin, not the result of *Qian* and *Kun*’s upper and lower interactions. *Qian*’s body remains above, unmoved, while the firmness of *Kan* (☵) and *Zhen* (☳) comes from outside. All these meanings arise from the hexagrams of the *Later Heaven*. Master Zhu said: Fu Xi’s circular arrangement of the eight trigrams was created through mutual opposition.",

      "translated_text": "Fu Xi’s sixty-four hexagrams in the horizontal arrangement were created through the principle of *flowing movement*. What governs *opposition* is secretly employed through *flowing movement*. *Opposition* arises from stillness as its body. Fu Xi’s eight trigrams embody *opposition*. When stillness gives rise, then fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse proceed from oneself. Thus it is said: the *Former Heaven* sequence is formed by the waxing and waning of the two *qi*, which is the principle of creation and the generation of beings.\n\nKing Wen’s eight trigrams in the circular arrangement were created through *flowing movement*. King Wen’s sixty-four hexagrams in the horizontal arrangement were created through *opposition*. What governs *flowing movement* is necessarily employed through *opposition*. *Flowing movement* arises from motion as its body. King Wen’s eight trigrams embody *flowing movement*. When motion is accomplished, then fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse are received from Heaven. Thus it is said: the *Later Heaven* sequence is formed by the flourishing and decline of the myriad things, which is the principle of creation’s cyclical movement.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, there is only *opposition* and *flowing movement*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the purest form of *opposition*. *Kan* and *Li* are the intermingling of *opposition*. *Xian* (䷞) and *Dai* (䷟) are the progression of *opposition*. *Jiji* (䷾) and *Weiji* (䷿) are the mixture of *opposition*. The *yin* and *yang* of *opposition* thus have the same function as the *yin* and *yang* of *flowing movement*. Only *yang* is employed in function: when still, it is two; when in motion, it is one. *Opposition* reverts to motion and becomes *flowing movement*. *Flowing movement* reverts to stillness and becomes *opposition*.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Former Heaven Diagram* possesses the marvels of *transformation* and *exchange*. The 192 lines on the left are fundamentally all *yang*. The 192 lines on the right are fundamentally all *yin*. Within *yin* there is *yang*, and within *yang* there is *yin*—this is *yang* advancing to exchange with *yin*, and *yin* coming to exchange with *yang*. The two sides correspond to each other, mutually transforming to form this diagram. In reality, it is not that one moves toward the other; it is merely that their images appear thus.\n\nOn the left side of the diagram, belonging to *yang*: from *Zhen* (one *yang*), to *Li* and *Dui* (two *yang*), to *Qian* (three *yang*). This is *yang* within *yang*, *yang* moving in sequence. On the right side of the diagram, belonging to *yin*: from *Xun* (one *yin*), to *Kan* and *Gen* (two *yin*), to *Kun* (three *yin*). This is *yin* within *yin*, *yin* moving in reverse.\n\n*Kun* has no *yang*; *Gen* and *Kan* have one *yang*. This is *yang* within *yin* moving in reverse. *Qian* has no *yin*; *Li* and *Dui* have one *yin*, *Zhen* has two *yin*. This is *yin* within *yang* moving in reverse. The five lines on the west are the *gou* (intermingling) of the five lines on the east. *Yang* having passed returns to the east, just as the five lines on the west. *Yin* and *yang* mutually transform through exchange, giving rise to the *Yi*’s *transformation*. Though the *Yi*’s *transformations* are manifold, this is the primary *transformation*.\n\nAt first, Fu Xi merely saw *yin* and *yang* beneath the Supreme Ultimate, so he drew one *yin* and one *yang*. One became two. On one *yang*, another *yang* and another *yin* were born; on one *yin*, another *yin* and another *yang* were born. Continuing thus in generation: from two to four, from four to eight, until eight times eight made sixty-four, all unfolding naturally. Such perfect order is the marvel of Heaven and Earth. The *Former Heaven Diagram* was merely sketched by the hand of the sage. In a single day, there is a principle of thought; in a month, a principle of lassitude. Extending to the twelve *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*—129,600 years—it is still only this principle. Vastly encompassing the 129,600 years of ancient and modern times, it is still only this cycle. Minutely observing the birth and death of beings, the movements of a day, an hour, a month, a year—it is still only this cycle. All proceed from *Fu* (䷗) and extend outward; it is merely the principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. What was small transforms into what is large; when it reaches its greatest extent, it transforms again into what is small.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Former Heaven Diagram* is the *ring within*. Master Zhang said: That which is round on the outside is Heaven; that which is square within is Earth. Humans stand upon the Earth and thus are within the *ring*. I say: Observing from above and below, *Qian* in the south is Heaven, *Kun* in the north is Earth. Observing from left and right, from *Zhen* to *Qian* on the left is Heaven. Great *yang*, great *yin*, lesser *yang*, and lesser *yin* arise, and the Dao of Heaven is complete. From *Xun* to *Kun* on the right is Earth. Great firmness, great softness, lesser firmness, and lesser softness arise, and the Dao of Earth is accomplished. Heaven envelops Earth externally. The two *qi* of *yin* and *yang*, though endlessly transforming, follow a single principle, cycling without end. This is why it is called the *ring within*.\n\nDwelling within the *ring* as human relationships: from *Qian* the ruler and *Kun* the minister, the *Family*, father and son, *Xian* and *Dai*, husband and wife, the six children emerge. Applying the *ring* to verify the square city: the Gate of Heaven has no above, the Door of Earth has no below. Rivers and marshes flow into the southeast, their currents endless. Kunlun rises in the northwest, its height unmatched. The great brightness of dawn emerges from *Li*; the *yin* spirit is conceived in the west within *Kan*. Thunder issues from *Zhen*, and the myriad things awaken. Wind enters *Xun*, and the myriad things wither. The images of the *ring within* may be glimpsed here.\n\nSeeking it in the four seasons: at the winter solstice, the *yang* spirit arrives at midnight; at the summer solstice, the *yin* ghost retreats at noon. The three *yang* and three *yin* divide spring; the three *yin* and three *yang* mark autumn’s midpoint. From crescent to full, from waning to new, the moon has its beginning and end. From dawn to day, from dusk to night, the *qi* has its reversal and sequence. Within the *ring*, the years, months, days, and hours—existence and decay, advance and retreat—may be discerned here.\n\nSeeking it in the opening and closing of *yin* and *yang*: Heaven initiates and Earth responds, giving rise to the sounds of the sun, moon, and stars. Earth harmonizes with Heaven, producing the tones of water, fire, earth, and stone. Opening and closing, the trigger moves and the pipes resound—this is the music of the *ring within*, rooted in Heaven’s truth. Seeking it in detail, it is nameless yet may be named.\n\nFu Xi released it to form the square and round diagrams. Emperor Shun performed it to bring forth the nine movements of the *Xiao Shao*.",
      "overlap_context": "un*.\n\nAs for *Song* (䷅) and *Yu* (䷆), which only mention \"firmness coming\" and \"firmness coming from outside,\" these hexagrams have four yang and two yin, not the result of *Qian* and *Kun*’s upper and lower interactions. *Qian*’s body remains above, unmoved, while the firmness of *Kan* (☵) and *Zhen* (☳) comes from outside. All these meanings arise from the hexagrams of the *Later Heaven*. Master Zhu said: Fu Xi’s circular arrangement of the eight trigrams was created through mutual opposition.",

      "translated_text": "Shào Kāngjié grasped it and composed the *Supreme Principles Governing the World*. Can one stand within the *ring*, bearing Heaven and treading Earth, yet remain unaware of its workings?\n\nKāngjié’s self-eulogy speaks of \"playing with the ring at leisure,\" where moments come and go. He also said: \"Since comprehending the meaning of the *ring within*, not a wisp of stray *qi* lingers in my breast.\" Thus, within his breast, he naturally possessed a *ring within*—this much is clear.\n\nHe further declared: \"The learning of *Xiāntiān* is the method of the heart.\" Hence, all diagrams begin from the center, for the myriad transformations and affairs arise from the heart.\n\nMaster Zhū said: \"The white space at the center is the *Tàijí*. The thirty-two *yīn* and thirty-two *yáng* form the Two Modes. The sixteen *yīn* and sixteen *yáng* constitute the Four Images. The eight *yīn* and eight *yáng* make up the Eight Trigrams. The two sides arise as *yīn* rooted in *yáng* and *yáng* rooted in *yīn*. This pairing emerges from the center, yet what issues from the *Tàijí* at the center is without counterpart—this is the method of the heart.\"\n\nIn my humble view: In the *Xiāntiān Diagram*, that which arises from *kūn* begins with *fù*, and that which arises from *qián* begins with *gòu*. Both reside within Heaven and Earth. The center is the heart, the *Tàijí*. It transcends the myriad things yet moves within them—hence, it is without counterpart.\n\nHe also said: \"Though the *Diagram* bears no text, I speak of it all day without ever departing from it. The principles generating Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all contained within.\" The *Xiāntiān Diagram* possesses positions and numbers, yet initially, no words or texts could convey it. Yet what lies within encompasses all—from the vastness of Heaven and Earth to the minutest tip of a hair. Above, the sun, moon, and stars; below, water, fire, earth, and stone. Transforming into heat and cold, day and night; transmuting into rain, wind, dew, and thunder. Resonating as temperament, form, and body; responding as creatures that walk, fly, and grow as plants. In humans, manifesting as ears, eyes, nose, and mouth; in things, as colors, sounds, *qi*, and flavors. Extending into epochs, kalpas, eons, and generations; dispersing into years, months, days, and hours. Affairs have substance and function, dividing into the eras of emperors, kings, and hegemons. Endeavors have their paths, branching into the *Book of Changes*, *Book of Documents*, *Book of Songs*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Though principle is one, its manifestations are many—nowhere does it not reside within.\n\nMaster Shào’s poem reads:\n*The sun, moon, and stars shine brightly above,\nThe emperors, kings, and hegemons spread grandly below.*\nThis may be called a pavilion within the breast, open on all sides.\n\nMaster Zhū praised him, saying:\n*A hero heaven-endowed, peerless in spirit,\nRiding wind and lashing thunder, his gaze boundless.\nWith hands he probes the moon’s cavern, with feet he treads the sky’s root.\nIn leisure, he spans past and present; in intoxication, he embraces Heaven and Earth.*\nSuch is the manner in which he vividly portrays one of the Dao—his bearing and presence.\n\nHe also said: \"In stillness, he deduced the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things.\"\n\nMaster Zhū remarked: \"Kāngjié’s *Nánzǐ Yín* speaks of the *Xiāntiān Diagram*, where numbers take their origin. *Tiāngēn* and *yuèkū* refer to the hexagrams *fù* and *gòu*.\" His poem reads:\n*Ears and eyes keen, the body of a true man,\nEndowed by the great potter—how could he be poor?\nOnly by probing the moon’s cavern can one know things;\nWithout treading the sky’s root, how can one recognize people?\nWhen *qián* meets *gòu*, the moon’s cavern is born;\nWhen Earth encounters thunder, the sky’s root appears.\n*Tiāngēn* and *yuèkū*, idly coming and going,\nThe thirty-six palaces—all are spring.*\n\n\"All are spring\" signifies the flowing of Heavenly principle.\n\nHe further said: \"In the *Diagram*, from *fù* to *qián* is *yáng*; from *gòu* to *kūn* is *yīn*. Since the two—*yīn* and *yáng*—govern good and evil, the beings they endow cannot but bear distinctions of purity and impurity. *Yáng* governs humans, *yīn* governs things. *Gòu* lies above in the *Diagram*, hence the phrase 'hand probes'; *fù* lies below, hence 'foot treads.'\"\n\nCài Xīshān said: \"*Tiāngēn* depicts the state of a good person, *yuèkū* that of a petty person. The thirty-six palaces are the lines of *yīn* and *yáng* in the Eight Trigrams.\" Another said: \"The terms 'human' and 'thing' cannot be simply divided into good and evil. 'All are spring'—even *yuèkū* is spring.\"\n\nMaster Zhū said: \"In terms of correct principle, *yáng* is good and *yīn* is evil—they form a pair, each with its own governance. Kāngjié likely referred to the source of living things: the upright *qi* becomes human, the biased *qi* becomes things—this is the distinction between *yīn* and *yáng*. Jìtōng’s discussion, however, seems to be an extended interpretation. Is 'all are spring' spoken solely in terms of correctness?\"\n\nHe asked: \"Crows, owls, toads, lizards, noxious weeds, and poisonous herbs—can one say they are not the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s *yīn* and *yáng*? That which is *yīn* and base is called 'thing'; that which is *yáng* and noble is called 'Heaven.'\"\n\nIn my humble view: From *fù* to *qián*, there are one hundred twelve *yáng* and eighty *yīn*; from *gòu* to *kūn*, one hundred twelve *yīn* and eighty *yáng*. *Yīn* and *yáng* intermingle, their interactions and encounters all bearing the essence of spring, flowing within them. Within my own body, too, there are these *fù* and *gòu*. On the summer solstice, when the sun is in *Dōngjǐng*, the myriad things turn toward nothingness. I, however, gather inward, returning to the uncarved, withdrawing blossoms to bear fruit—this is the resurgence of life’s intent within. On the winter solstice, when the sun is in *Qiānniú*, the myriad things turn toward being. I then expand outward, reaching to Heaven and coiling upon Earth—this is the flourishing of life’s intent without. Viewed thus, the creative work of the Maker by day is the flow of life’s intent, while human rest at night is the return of life’s intent. Where is there not spring?\n\nChéng Bózǐ said: \"Kāngjié’s learning is the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship.\" At the outset of Kāngjié’s entry into the Dao, Lord Qīngshè imparted to him the study of the nature of things and the mandate of life. Later, amid movement and stillness, he perceived it and attained its handle.",

When Master Zhang was magistrate of Shangluo, he repeatedly visited the master’s dwelling and bowed to him, asking: \"How many days does it take to master this learning?\" The master replied: \"There is nothing much to it—with your talent, it can be grasped in an instant. But you must follow me in the woods for ten years, allowing worldly concerns to scatter, before it can be transmitted.\"\n\nWhen Shu He came to study, he ceaselessly cited ancient and modern examples. The master said: \"Set that aside for now—prior Heaven has no need for so many words. First, empty your heart, making your breast vast and unburdened, free of any affair, before it is possible.\"\n\nThus his poems say:\n*\"If asked about the primordial One character...\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Strength to uproot mountains and cover the world is called talent,\nYet here, not even the slightest force avails.\"*\n\nWhen the master fell slightly ill, Shu tasted his medicinal porridge and said: \"I am no Yellow Stone or foolish old man—kneeling to tie your shoes would suffice to obtain it.\" The master replied: \"Without a sincere heart, the Way is distant.\" Shu was then convinced in his heart. The hearts of these two disciples had already been grasped by the master. For his breast was crystalline, responding to things as they came—yet he did not transmit to those unworthy. As with Qin Zhen and Ren Yan, or Zheng Yang of Jiangnan, who stole his learning to seek glory and wealth, they ultimately starved to death.\n\nI say: The learning of prior Heaven cannot be attained except by one whose nature is purely of Heaven.\n\nThe \"thirty-six palaces\" have been interpreted in four ways by former scholars:\n1. *Qian* as one and *Dui* as two make three; *Li* as three and *Zhen* as four make seven; *Xun* as five and *Kan* as six make eleven; *Gen* as seven and *Kun* as eight make fifteen.\n2. The nine lines of *Qian* and *Kun*; the five lines each of *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* make fifteen; the four lines each of *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* make twelve.\n3. *Qian* as one pairs with *Kun* as eight, down to *Zhen* as four pairing with *Xun* as five—eight palaces forming four nines, totaling thirty-six.\n4. The eight proper hexagrams plus twenty-eight inverted hexagrams make thirty-six, matching the hidden hexagrams of prior Heaven.\n\nI say: This last interpretation is correct.\n\nMaster Fang of Xugu criticized them, saying: \"The theory of palaces based on the sequence of prior Heaven hexagrams is inappropriate; dividing odd and even hexagrams into daytime palaces is fabricated; the theory of quadrupling nine is unclear. As for the fourth interpretation—adding proper and inverted hexagrams to obtain thirty-six hidden palaces—it is clever but insipid.\"\n\nIn my view: In the *Xiantian Circular Diagram*, *Fu* begins at *zi*, and the left 180 days form eighteen palaces. *Gou* begins at *wu*, and the right 180 days form eighteen palaces. One *xun* (ten-day period) is one palace, and the 360 days of a year complete the cycle of gestation and return.\n\nI say: This interpretation is good but not exhaustive. Let me complete it:\nFrom *zi* to *si*, the six branches correspond to the six hexagrams from *Fu* to *Qian*. From *wu* to *hai*, the six branches correspond to the six hexagrams from *Gou* to *Kun*. *Qian* begins with *initial nine*, a single yang that does not interact. *Kun* begins with *initial six*, which becomes *Fu*—the hexagram of the eleventh month—named by Quezi as the \"Heavenly Root,\" meaning the odd yang is the root, born at *zi*. *Kun* begins with *initial six*, a single yin that rises to interact. *Qian* begins with *initial nine*, which becomes *Gou*—the hexagram of the fifth month—named the \"Cavern of the Sun and Moon,\" meaning the even yin symbol emerges as a cavern at *wu*.\n\n*Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents, thus giving birth to *Fu* and *Gou*. *Fu* and *Gou* are the lesser parents, generating one yin and one yang. The alternation of yin and yang begins here. *Fu* and *Gou* become *Lin* and *Dun*, marking the ebb and flow of two yins and two yangs—this is the month of *chou* and *wei*. From *Lin* and *Dun* to *Pi* and *Tai*, the ebb and flow of three yins and three yangs—this is the month of *yin* and *shen*. Proceeding to four yins and four yangs, forming *Guan* and *Zhuang*; five yins and five yangs, forming *Cui* and *Bo*. Finally, six yins and six yangs intermingle and transform. *Fu* and *Gou* return to *Qian* and *Kun*, and *Qian* and *Kun* return to *Fu* and *Gou*, flowing and opposing within the twelve palaces. Within these, there can be no yin without yang, no yang without yin. Divided, they become thirty-six yins and thirty-six yangs, scattered within the 360 days. Combined, they are but one yin and one yang. Doubling the five phases yields the thirty-six palaces.\n\nThings obtain this and are born and transformed; people obtain this and are harmonious and joyful—how great is this spring!\n\nExtending this further, thirty-six becomes seventy-two, and the numbers are inexhaustible. Contracting it, one day has 36,000 seconds, and one month has 360 hours.",

      "translated_text": "Even in the finest details—whether a single insect, fish, plant, or tree—each possesses its own yin and yang, weaving as warp and weft within. Yet people remain unaware of this.\n\nThe noble person who studies and attains this understanding delights in Heaven’s decree and knows fate, free from worry.\n\nNow, regarding the left rotation of the Heavenly Dao and the right revolution of the sun and moon, with yang on the left and yin on the right, day and night succeeding one another—there are three explanations for this:\n\nFirst, the unity of the Heavenly Dao and the sun and moon;\nsecond, *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo*;\nthird, *The Precelestial Diagram*.\n\nTheir positions are determined by facing south from the north, with east on the left and west on the right.\n\nYet *The Precelestial Diagram* derives its left and right from *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo*, while *The River Chart* and *The Writ of the Luo* themselves arise from the left rotation of Heaven and the right motion of the sun and moon. Thus it is said: \"The hanging images display their brightness—none greater than the sun and moon.\" Ah! Heaven’s revelation to humanity is most profound.\n\n*The Essential Meaning of Ancient Texts* states: \"The celestial wheel rotates left from west to east, while the sun and moon revolve right from east to west.\" It also says: \"The twenty-eight lunar lodges all follow Heaven’s motion in leftward rotation, while the sun, moon, and five planets all move right along the earthly path. The sun travels through the six *jia* of Heaven, meeting the Dipper. The Dipper’s handle points left according to the monthly establishment, while the sun meets the moon and moves right. In the first month, the Dipper points to *yin* in the east, and the sun and moon converge northward in *hai*, aligning with *yin*. In the fourth month, the Dipper points to *si* in the south, and the sun and moon converge westward in *shen*, aligning with *si*. Heaven moves left by one degree, distributing *qi* to generate beings. The sun and moon also shift right by one degree, altering the seasons to respond to Heaven. When Heaven and the sun align, the *qi* and climate harmonize.\"\n\nMoreover, Jupiter and the Great Year also move left and right. The Great Year corresponds to the sequence from *zi* to *hai*. Jupiter is the essence of wood, called the Year Star; Mars is the essence of fire, called the Sparkling Deluder, and so on. Jupiter, being yang, moves right through the heavens, traversing the twelve celestial stations. The Great Year, being yin, moves left through the earth, passing through the twelve earthly branches. Thus, twelve years complete one cycle, forming a great era. For details, see *Shaoyang*.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Heaven rotates left, the sun moves right.\" He also said: \"Left rotation and right motion—this is the intersection of Heaven and the sun.\" And again: \"Kan and Li stand as the gates of left and right, the places where the sun and moon enter and exit.\"\n\n*The River Chart*’s *Earthly Image* states: \"Heaven moves left, beginning at Oxherd; Earth moves right, beginning at Net.\" The degrees of Heaven and Earth diverge.\n\nIt is also said: \"*The Writ of the Luo*, in terms of the sequence of movement, begins in the west, then proceeds to the south, east, center, and north—rotating right in a full circle before returning to the west. This symbolizes Earth’s rightward motion to generate beings.\"\n\nCai Jiufeng said: \"In form, the number is ten; in function, it is nine. Ten cannot change—this is the number of *The River Chart*. Nine can change—this is *The Writ of the Luo*. *The Chart* arranges its numbers in opposition to establish form; *The Writ* interlaces its numbers to enable function. Once form is established, if the numbers do not change, function cannot proceed.\"\n\nNow, applying the mutable numbers of *The Writ of the Luo*:\nIn one diagram, the numbers for left and right rotation are complete.\nYang moves left with three:\nHeaven is round, its diameter one, circumference three—three is the number of Heaven.\nOne is in the north.\nOne multiplied by three is three, which is in the east.\nThree times three is nine, residing in the south.\nNine times three is twenty-seven, residing in the west.\nThree times twenty-seven is eighty-one, returning to one in the north.\nFrom north to east, east to south, south to west, west back to north—endlessly cycling, perfectly embodying the principle of Heaven’s left rotation.\n\nEarth is square, its diameter one, circumference four—two doubled.\nFor Earth’s numbers begin with two, taking yin as their origin.\nIts position is in the southwest, moving right.\nTwo doubled is four, residing in the southeast.\nTwo times four is eight, in the northeast.\nTwo times eight is sixteen, in the northwest.\nTwo times sixteen is thirty-two, returning to two in the southwest.\nFrom its original position in the southwest to the southeast, southeast to northeast, northeast to northwest, northwest back to southwest—also endlessly cycling, perfectly harmonizing with the theory of Earth’s rightward motion.\n\nOne, three, seven, nine—yang occupies the four cardinal directions.\nTwo, four, six, eight—yin occupies the four corners.\nLeft and right rotation interweave as warp and weft.\nSuch is the marvel of creation.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, no thing lacks left and right—from our own hands, feet, ears, and eyes to men on the left and women on the right, host on the left and guest on the right—all follow this pattern, rooted in the fixed divisions of creation.\n\nIf one examines *The River Chart*, the same principle applies, though yin and yang are arranged in opposition internally and externally, with differences in their interlacing.\n\n*The Original Subtleties of Heaven*, Scroll Fourteen, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Subtleties of Heaven’s Origin, Scroll Fifteen**\n*Compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai*\n*Collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu*\n\n---\n\n**Section Two: The Two Middles**\n\nThe numbers one through ten are the complete enumeration of Heaven and Earth. Five and six are the central numbers of Heaven and Earth. Five, residing at the center of Heaven, governs the generating numbers; six, residing at the center of Earth, governs the completing numbers. Five is also called the \"center of yang,\" for it stands amid one, three, seven, and nine. Six is also called the \"center of yin,\" for it stands amid two, four, eight, and ten.\n\nSpeaking of the total numbers of Heaven and Earth: five fives make twenty-five, five sixes make thirty, and five tens with five make fifty-five. Omitting the five leaves the Heavenly numbers. Centered on five, the remainder is fifty, which is the number of the *Great Expansion*. Omitting the six leaves the Earthly numbers. Centered on six, the remainder is forty-nine, which is the number of the *Stalks and Milfoil*. These two central numbers circulate between Heaven and Earth. Those who attain the center are upright and auspicious; those who exceed or fall short are #1 lost and inauspicious.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The origin of Heaven and Earth lies in the center. Man dwells at the center of Heaven and Earth, and the heart dwells at the center of man. When the sun reaches its zenith, it is at its fullest; when the moon reaches its midpoint, it is full. Thus the noble person values the timely center.\"\n\nThe *Great Ultimate* divides into Heaven and Earth. In Heaven and Earth, it becomes man; in man, it becomes the heart. Man is the heart of Heaven and Earth. Within the human heart lies another Heaven and Earth. When the sage emerges to establish the center and create the ultimate, he can give Heaven and Earth a heart, guiding all under Heaven to return to the center. Thus he assists in #3 completing and harmonizing with Heaven.\n\nTherefore, Heaven takes *wu* (noon) as its center, Earth takes *zi* (midnight) as its center. Yang takes *mao* (dawn) #4 as its center, yin takes *you* (dusk) as its center. Heaven and Earth never deviate from the center for even a moment.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"When the sun reaches its zenith, it shifts; when the moon is full, it wanes.\" Excess leads to decline and imbalance—this is why the noble person values the timely center.\n\nThe *Great Commentary on the Changes* speaks of the numbers of Heaven and Earth as fifty-five, and the number of the *Great Expansion* as fifty. The Heavenly numbers are twenty-five, five times five. The Earthly numbers are thirty, six times five. The *Lesser Expansion* is ten, two times five. The *Great Expansion* is fifty, ten times five.\n\nIn my humble opinion: Dong Zhu once said that all numbers do not exceed five. Five is the ancestral number, corresponding to the three yang and two yin of Heaven and Earth, interwoven so that all numbers resolve to five. Three times three and three times two—both the numbers of old yin and old yang—are five. Two times three and one times two—the number of young yin—is five. Two times two and one times three—the number of young yang—is five. From one five to nine five, the blessings total forty-#5five. The numbers of the nine chapters are all five. Thus, both the *Diagram* and the *Book* take five as the ancestral origin of numbers.\n\nTherefore, qi has the five phases, man has the five constants, Heaven has the five stars, Earth has the five peaks, music has the five tones, and colors have the five hues. Extending further: governance has the five teachings, rituals have the five orders, garments have the five insignia, punishments have the five penalties, food has the five flavors and five grains, and armies have the five formations of troops and chariots. All are governed by the Heavenly center of five—this is evident.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *Canon of Yao* speaks of a full year as three hundred and sixty-six days. *Kang Gao* states that after five or six days, it reaches a full decade. Hexagrams have six lines, and the moon has five or six periods totaling thirty days. Six days after birth, light appears; six days later, the first quarter; six days later, the full moon. Another six days, the waning begins; another six days, its function ceases. From *zi* to *si* are the six yang months; from *wu* to *hai* are the six yin months. Five and six multiply to generate transformation. Thus, two sixes make twelve months; three sixes make eighteen changes; four sixes make the twenty-four solar terms; six sixes make the number of a full year.\n\nExtending further: man has the six virtues, six conducts, and six arts; vessels have the six ritual goblets, six ceremonial wine vessels, six sacrificial dishes, and six offering stands; music has the six pitch standards and six complementary tones; the *Rites of Zhou* has the six canons and six ministries; the queen has the six robes. Also, food uses the six grains, meals use the six livestock, drink uses the six pure beverages, delicacies use one hundred twenty items, sauces use one hundred twenty jars, and tripods use twelve objects—all are six. By governing six with five and pairing six with five, the myriad transformations never lose the Earthly center of six.\n\nMaster Zhu said: The numbers of Heaven and Earth take six as their measure. When six yang reaches its extreme, one yin is born to restrain it and prevent excess. When six yin reaches its extreme, one yang is born to restrain it and prevent overgrowth. This restraint is called the \"measure of Heaven and Earth,\" and the four seasons are thereby completed. The division of *zi* and *wu* (midnight and noon) marks the great measures of Heaven and Earth. The four seasons and eight nodes complete a year—these are the greatest measures. Six becomes twelve, twenty-four, and seventy-two—these are the lesser measures. Day divides into day and night, numbers divide into odd and even, each forming twelve. The use of two hundred twenty-four is also measured by six.\n\nThe numbers of the *Changes* total sixty: thirty-six for old yang, paired with twenty-four for old yin, together making sixty. Thirty-two for young yin, paired with twenty-eight for young yang, also making sixty. Ten stems and twelve branches combine to make sixty. The five tones and twelve pitches of bells and pipes accumulate to sixty.\n\nMaster Shao said: The heavenly stems end with six, the earthly branches end with five. The *Inner Transmission* records that the Yellow Emperor commanded Da Rao to create the *Jia-Zi* system, divining by the handle of the Dipper’s bowl. He named *jia* and *yi* as days—these are the heavenly stems. He named *zi* and *chou* as months—these are the earthly branches. Stems and branches combine to form the sixty-day cycle.\n\nIn my humble opinion: That which originates in five ends in six; that which originates in six ends in five. Five is the ten heavenly stems, #6 six is the twelve earthly branches. Two sixes pair to make twelve; five and six multiply to make thirty. Yang numbers begin with thirty, hence a month has thirty days, and a generation has thirty years.",

      "translated_text": "Yin numbers begin with twelve, hence a day has twelve *chen* (double-hours), and a year has twelve months. Multiplying a year’s months by thirty yields three hundred sixty days; multiplying a year’s days by twelve yields four thousand three hundred twenty *shi* (hours). Twelve and thirty, when added or multiplied, are all derived from five and six.\n\nThe *Qianxu* takes the central number of heaven: five multiplied by five makes twenty-five, the central number of earth; five multiplied by six makes thirty. Combined, fifty-five forms the *xuanxu* (mysterious void), the numbers of generation and completion. The generating numbers are one, two, three, four, five—five stands at heaven’s center and precedes six. The completing numbers are six, seven, eight, nine, ten—six stands at earth’s center and follows five. One and five form six (water); two and five form seven (fire); three and five form eight (wood); four and five form nine (metal); five and five form ten (earth). Water has source and outflow; fire has flame and radiance; wood has root and branch; metal has edge and blade; earth has foundation and burial mound—all do not exceed five and six.\n\nWithin yang, five becomes ten by doubling; within yin, six becomes twelve by doubling. Kangjie (Shao Yong) took these two central numbers to compose the *Huangji Lishi* (Supreme Principles Through the Ages), thereby illuminating the principle of the great mean and perfect correctness. Masters Ma and Shao, morning and evening, expounded and clarified this together, and the learning of the *xuanxu* was thus refined.\n\nHeaven’s movements: in small cycles, they change through five and six; in great cycles, they change through sixty. When correlated with hexagram qi: one month has five hexagrams, one hexagram has six lines—five and six make thirty. Six yang and six yin: the twelve branches course through the twelve months and three hundred sixty days. This is the small cycle advancing and retreating by six days, hence the small cycle changes through six. Sixty changes, with their remaining fractions, also complete three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven’s Dao changes through six, with residual fractions: six days pass through six *chen*. After *zi* (midnight), the six *shi* advance; after *wu* (noon), the six *shi* retreat. Further correlating with the six *jia*: sometimes change occurs every six months, sometimes every six years, sometimes every sixty years, sometimes every three hundred sixty years. Thus, the great cycle changes through sixty, and six changes, with their residual fractions, yield three hundred sixty-six.\n\nIn great cycles, sixty years mark one change—*jiazi* and *jiawu* each constitute one generation. In small cycles, six months mark one change: after *zi*, six months bring growth; after *wu*, six months bring decline. Six years mark one change—the number of the six qi. Sixty years mark one change—the number of the five movements.\n\nMaster Cai of Xishan said: Heaven’s numbers center on five; earth’s numbers center on six. Heaven has yin and yang, so doubling five makes ten. Combining three and seven, or one and nine, also yields ten. Earth has hardness and softness, so doubling six makes twelve. Combining four and eight, or two and ten, also yields twelve. The ten heavenly stems arise from the five phases having yin and yang; the twelve earthly branches arise from the six qi having hardness and softness. The five phases and six qi are fundamentally one qi.\n\nThe five phases in heaven become the five qi—rain, sunshine, cold, warmth, and wind. On earth, they become the five substances—water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. In heaven, rain corresponds to earth’s water; in heaven, sunshine corresponds to earth’s fire. Water and fire possess qi, while rain and sunshine possess substance. Rain and sunshine are heaven interfacing with earth; water and fire are earth interfacing with heaven. Two transform, while three remain unchanging. Two attain the correctness of yin and yang; three attain the mixture of yin and yang.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: The people have the six emotions—love, hate, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness—born of the six qi. The people receive the qi of yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and brightness to live: yin is metal, wind is earth, rain is wood, darkness is water, and brightness is fire. Love arises from yang; hate arises from yin; joy arises from wind; anger arises from rain; sorrow arises from darkness; happiness arises from brightness.\n\nThus, heaven has six qi that descend to generate the five flavors. People consume the five flavors, corresponding to heaven’s six qi. Sorrow gives rise to weeping; happiness gives rise to song and dance; joy gives rise to giving; anger gives rise to conflict. Joy arises from love; anger arises from hate. When sorrow and happiness are not lost, one can harmonize with the nature of heaven and earth and thus endure long.\n\nIn my humble opinion: People’s qi endowments are uneven. Those who are hard may err in excessive hardness; those who are soft may err in excessive softness. One must first overcome and refine their biases. Among them, there is a type of person exceptionally fierce and resolute—this is encountering an excess of yang qi. There is a type of person extremely weak and timid—this is encountering an excess of yin qi. Some are restless, violent, and wrathful—this is encountering the malignance of yang qi. Some are cunning, deceitful, and treacherous—this is encountering the malignance of yin qi. Some have a nature that is adaptable, turning with a single touch. Some are stubborn and foolish, unable to accept even a single word of good advice, no different from beasts. All these arise from such qi endowments, not from the qi of yin and yang itself. Evil arises merely from the separation, combination, and transformation of qi. Within the unevenness, differences naturally form, giving rise to fragmented likes and dislikes.\n\nThus it is said: Heaven, earth, and humanity share one qi. When heaven reverses its seasons, it becomes disaster; when earth reverses its creatures, it becomes omen. When the people reverse virtue, it becomes chaos—this can move heaven and earth to produce omens. When things lose their nature and reverse the norm, they become omens.\n\nThe historian states: Omens and disasters include floods, droughts, famines, untimely cold and heat, thunder and hail as calamities, solar and lunar eclipses, comets and meteors, halos, mock suns, intersecting arcs, celestial phenomena like \"back holes\" and \"speech embraces,\" locust plagues, silkworm anomalies, misaligned constellations, landslides, earthquakes; yang qi suppressed and unable to emerge, yin qi oppressed and unable to ascend. The six qi congeal into ominous leaves, pestilential misfortunes, and blue omens—all reverse the norm to harm the people’s nature.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, to transform inverted qi into harmonious qi lies solely with the ruler, who attains the Mean and Harmony to align heaven and earth. When yang returns, in the fifth month a single yin is born, becoming the initial line of *Kun*. In the sixth month, it retreats, and a second yin arises. In the seventh month, it closes, and a third yin arises, completing the three lines of *Kun* within. In the eighth month, it observes, and a fourth yin arises. In the ninth month, it strips away, and a fifth yin arises. Accumulating until the tenth month, the top line of *Kun* is reached, and the six yins are fully realized—then its number is exhausted and reverts to seven. Again, the initial line of *Kun* transforms into yang, and the hexagram is named *Fu* (Return). From *Shi* (Pregnancy), *Dun* (Retreat), *Pi* (Obstruction), *Guan* (Observation), *Bo* (Stripping), and *Kun* (Earth) to *Fu* (Return), it undergoes nearly seven changes, hence the saying \"seven days.\" This is the fundamental purport of the *Great Changes* and the orthodox interpretation of former scholars.\n\nYet the *Zhengyi* also cites the theory of \"six days and seven parts,\" aligning with Zheng Sinong’s reference to the *Yi Wei*, thus completing the hexagram qi. It further states: \"Confucius’s apocrypha are clear, and Wang Bi’s commentary is as such. Can Zheng Kangcheng’s explanation be reconciled?\" How, then, to regard these two theories? It is said: both are valid. The *Changes* encompass all phenomena, adapting with time to follow the Dao without exception. In interpreting the sacred canon, one should adhere to the orthodox interpretations of former scholars. Taking \"seven days\" as seven months is acceptable. To establish hexagram qi and rectify the degrees of the celestial sphere, using \"six days and seven parts\" is also unobjectionable. Both are preserved here to await future sages.\n\nHowever, Kong’s explanation in Wang’s transmission states: \"After the yang qi of heaven is extinguished, it revives within seven days.\" The phrase \"extinguished\" is somewhat dubious. Though yang qi may be subtle, how could it ever be extinguished? Moreover, Wang Kui’s account, from the fifth to the eleventh month, posits that the sun traverses seven celestial lodges, then abandons yang qi before it returns—this is incorrect. Little does he realize that the celestial sphere comprises twenty-eight lodges; the sun moves one degree per day, traversing one lodge per day, and its conjunction with the moon marks a month. Essentially, if the sun moves through seven lodges, it is seven months—how can one alter months to speak of days? To take the sun’s movement through one lodge as a single day is untenable. The distinction between \"seven days\" and \"seven months\" has been thoroughly examined by former scholars.\n\nIn my humble view: by the tenth month, one yang is stripped away, and from *Shi* to *Kun*, the six yangs are exhausted. By the eleventh month, at the midpoint of *Zi*, one yang is born. Taking yang as primary and counting it with the preceding numbers, it is said: \"In seven days, it returns.\" \"Seven days\" is thus seven months. Taking yin as primary, it is called \"months.\" From the fifth to the tenth month, six yins fully mature—this is merely six months. Thus, \"seven days\" is emphasized to manifest the principle of exalting yang.\n\nThere are three interpretations of *Fu* (Return), yet the underlying principle is one. Lianxi, focusing on the point of return in *Kun*, says: \"It is beneficial to be steadfast.\" His explanation of sincere return aligns with Wang Bi’s. Yichuan, focusing on the dynamic aspect at the inception of the *Yuan* character, says: \"It is the inception of movement,\" thereby revealing the heart of heaven and earth. Kangjie, addressing the interplay of movement and stillness, says: \"Between one movement and one stillness.\" Zhu Xi remarks that the principle is the same, though the points of reference differ.\n\nRegarding the *Fu* hexagram, the bottom line is precisely where movement occurs. How can one speak of stillness? Observing the image of thunder beneath the earth, Yichuan’s interpretation is correct. Though *Fu* has three divisions, its lines number six. Zhu Xi says: \"Heaven and earth have yin, thus there is return; the multitude have evil, thus there is return; the sage has no return.\" I also say: the multitude have return, the worthy do not stray far from return, and the petty person is deluded by return.\n\nSomeone asked Zhu Xi: \"Within utter stillness, if a single thought arises, is this return?\" He replied: \"Your question is inexhaustible. There is return of good and evil, and return of movement and stillness—these two must be clearly distinguished.\" In my view, the sage’s heart is a companion to creation. Like an infant, it does not lose the undifferentiated principle of heaven. Without interruption, who can perceive its arising and ceasing? This is called \"no return.\"\n\nDay after day, in ceaseless turmoil, the heart of compassion and shame suddenly stirs in a moment of awakening—this is the division of good and evil into yin and yang. Or, when a single thought arises from utter stillness, this is the division of movement and stillness into yin and yang. The human heart is inherently empty, luminous, and unobscured. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, recognizing it as the good heart and expanding it fulfills its capacity. When stillness is found within movement, discerning and suppressing what is not good eradicates evil by its root. Thus, human desires are entirely eliminated, and heavenly principle is ever-present. One may then progress from having return to aspiring to the sage’s state of no return.\n\nExtending this to the six lines of *Fu*: the first nine, \"not straying far from return,\" Confucius assigns to Yanzi. The remaining five lines do not specify individuals, for admonition and warning are subtly conveyed without explicit words—truth is thus revealed. It is said that Zixia, upon hearing criticism, rested in return; Zengzi reflected daily, Boyu yearly—these are frequent returns. Yi’s solitary return, Zhou Tu of Han’s earnest return—these attributions may be questionable. Lu Qi’s deluded return, however, aptly illustrates its peril.\n\nIn my view, beneath deluded return lie earnest, solitary, frequent, and resting returns—these are what Zhu Xi calls \"the multitude’s having return.\" Though their ranks vary in excellence, none match Yanzi’s learning of foreknowing the subtle. \"Conquering the self for a single day, the world turns to benevolence\"—the heavens open as if the clouds have dispersed.\n\nThe sage teaches by holding up the highest standard; for those of lesser capacity, one may proceed in order. The *Xiang* says: \"In seven days, it returns—this is the course of heaven.\" The explanation of \"seven days\" has been given above. Master Cheng says: \"Heaven’s movement, with its waxing and waning, is the principle of heaven.\" Master Hengqu says: \"Seven days and nights follow one another without interruption.\"",

What is more, from the inception to the dissolution of a cycle, from the origin of heaven and earth to the present, it has ever been thus. For stillness gives rise to movement, and heaven, without intent or action, governs nothing. Being perpetually so, how could it ever rest? If one contrives or arranges stillness, how could it endure? From this, it departs.\n\nMaster Zhu says: \"When *Bo* reaches its extreme, it becomes *Kun*. Yang descends and enters *Kun*. When the extreme moves, yang ascends and emerges, traversing the six yin lines. When it reaches the extreme and returns to the beginning, this is the course of the sun, the moon, and the year. The numbers of heaven, earth, and the Five Phases cannot be defied. And again, it is said to be seven days—this clarifies the origin of pitch and calendar. Thus, the sun, moon, and five planets begin in *Qianniu*. Qi begins at midnight, the calendar begins at the winter solstice, and pitch begins with *Huangzhong*. Yang Xiong grasped this and composed eighty-one chapters to exhaust the numbers of one *yuan*, six *jia*, three systems, nine gatherings, and two hundred forty-two sections. Shao Yong grasped it and thereby elucidated the origins, conjunctions, evolutions, and epochs of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations, exhausting the boundless numbers of heaven and earth’s waxing and waning.\n\nIn my humble view, Master Cheng’s explanation of the principle of heaven’s waxing and waning is concise and precise. Master Zhang’s account captures the grandeur of the phenomenon, stating that the yang qi circulates even in the depths of winter without ever ceasing—all deduced from the generative principle of *Qian* and *Kun*. As for Hanshang, he elucidates principle solely through numbers, using the seven-day cycle to infer the origins of pitch, calendar, and hexagram qi, as well as the theory of the winter solstice and midnight. He further cites the *Tai Xuan* and *Huangji Jingshi* to expand upon this. Thus, *Fu* not only clarifies principle but also encompasses number.\n\nMaster Zhu has said: \"Heaven and earth are fundamentally the circulation of a single qi, manifesting as movement and stillness. In terms of the essence of this circulation, it may simply be called *Qian*, which encompasses all. When divided into movement and stillness, it becomes yang odd and yin even. Whether vast as heaven, earth, sun, moon, and stars, or minute as years, months, days, hours, cold, heat, day, and night, all are encompassed.\" Thus, the coming of yang and the going of yin in *Fu* fully embodies the meaning of heaven’s movement from end to beginning.\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Book of Changes* says: \"*Fu* is small yet discernible among things.\" A single yang sprouts in the Yellow Palace, beneath the host of yin—its beginning is as fine as a thread of silk. Yet amidst the multitude of yin, it does not intermingle, like a speck of white in darkness. The white is discernible, and the mass of black cannot obscure its whiteness. Like the sun not yet risen above the earth, even when hidden within the earth, it cannot be contained. Viewed through human affairs, it is like Yanzi: though deemed foolish, among the three thousand disciples, none failed to call him worthy. Thus, Master Zhu says: \"When the good in a person first sprouts, though small, the multitude of evils cannot suppress it.\"\n\nMaster Xu says: \"*Fu* is the incipient moment of returning to goodness. One must, at the first stirring of thought, in what others do not know and only the self knows, carefully examine this incipient moment and return to goodness. Acting in accord with principle, one becomes a noble person; violating principle, one becomes petty. If one fails to discern this clearly, then in matters, a hairsbreadth of deviation leads to an error of a thousand miles. How can one not stand in awe?\"\n\nMaster Cheng says: \"Yang has no principle of exhaustion. When it changes above, it is born below. There is no interval where it can be contained—this is its rest.\" When *Bo* is exhausted, it becomes pure *Kun*. How could there still be yang? If hexagrams are matched to months, this corresponds to the tenth month. In terms of qi’s waxing and waning, yang’s exhaustion forms *Kun*, and yang’s return forms *Fu*—yang is never exhausted. Thus, the tenth month is called the \"yang month,\" lest one doubt the absence of yang.\n\nMaster Cheng Bozi said: \"The gloss of *xi* as 'birth' refers to one matter: when there is rest, one matter is born, with no interruption in between.\" Master Zhu further said: \"When *Bo* is exhausted and becomes *Kun*, a single yang immediately arises below without any discontinuity. This reveals that heaven and earth have no place of rest. For example, in a month of thirty days, the single yang of *Fu* is divided into thirty parts. It gradually accumulates from these thirty days, one part at a time. From the *Xiaoxue* period after the tenth month, with each central qi, one part of yang is born daily. As one part is extinguished above, one part is born below. In all cases of yin and yang’s generation, one line corresponds to one month. Only after thirty days are fulfilled does that space become complete, forming one line. Now, the *Kun* hexagram is not devoid of yang—its beginning is merely exceedingly subtle. Before that space is filled to form a line, it is not that *Kun* is purely yin without yang. This is not an abstruse matter, yet Yichuan did not explain it clearly to others, compelling them to undertake a great endeavor. Initially, a few words were lacking to convey the gradual waxing and waning, the inseparability of yin and yang.\"\n\nMaster Zhu says: \"The single yang of *Fu* does not arise suddenly. Rather, it accumulates from the *Kun* hexagram. It is not that at the midnight of the winter solstice, the yang suddenly arises. Precisely at the midpoint of *zi*, the calculation of that single yang is completed. After the midpoint of *zi*, the second yang begins to arise, gradually forming two yang. After a month, it becomes *Lin*. Master Zhu further said: \"From *Guan* to *Bo*, thirty days pass before *Bo* is exhausted. From *Bo* to *Kun*, another thirty days pass before *Kun* is complete. Over thirty days, yang gradually grows, reaching one yang at the winter solstice. The second yang then begins to diminish yin. Each day, one-thirtieth of yin is exhausted, and after a month, it is fully exhausted. As yang grows, each day one-thirtieth of yang is added, and after a month, one yang is fully formed. During the exhaustion, each day of twelve *ke* gradually diminishes in full. One day exhausts one-thirtieth. The gradual growth of yang is likewise—each month’s crescent and full moon reveal how yin and yang thus successively arise.\"",

The *Xiang* says: \"In seven days, it returns—this is the course of heaven.\" The explanation of \"seven days\" has been given above. Master Cheng says: \"Heaven’s movement, with its waxing and waning, is the principle of heaven.\" Master Hengqu says: \"Seven days and nights follow one another without interruption.\"",

      "translated_text": "The yin does not deplete all at once, nor does the yang grow all at once. In the ninth month, yin reaches its extreme, and yang has already begun to arise below, though it has yet to take form. The six yang lines divide into six segments, and each segment further divides into thirty parts. Even the smallest segments must accumulate incrementally, and only at the winter solstice does one yang line fully form. The top line of *Bo*’s *nine at the top* is divided into thirty parts, with one part depleted each day until the end of the ninth month, when it is fully exhausted. The same applies to yin.\n\nThis can be understood by observing gestation, though the sages did not speak of it thus. It is further said: Within the space between heaven and earth, qi exists in six layers. This qi ascends and descends, rising and falling. At the winter solstice in the eleventh month, it begins to arise from the lowest layer, ascending all the way to the sixth. By the fourth month, when it reaches the heavens, the yang qi, having just fully formed, begins to dissipate. It is this single qi that rises and falls in endless circulation, moving through the six layers. All arising is but yang qi. When yang grows by one part, it does not borrow from yin; rather, where yang dissipates, yin naturally emerges.\n\nThus, the arrival of yang is *Fu* (Return), and *Fu* is the original state of things. The arrival of yin is *Gou* (Stain), and *Gou* is but an accidental encounter. It is further said: In the hexagram *Fu*, the single line at the bottom is movement. Master Cheng said: \"Since ancient times, Confucians have spoken of stillness as revealing the heart of heaven and earth, but I alone say that movement reveals it.\" Someone asked: \"Is this not seeking stillness within movement?\" He replied: \"Indeed. Yet it is most difficult to speak of a 'movement' before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure have arisen. Stillness may be spoken of, but how can one apply the word 'movement'? Stillness must involve some thing to be called so—this is where the difficulty lies. What is stillness like?\" He said: \"It cannot be called 'nothing,' yet there is awareness. If there is awareness, then it is movement—how can it be called stillness? One who speaks well of the heart can observe the heart of heaven and earth in this.\"\n\nI say: Before thoughts arise, it may indeed be called stillness. Master Zhu said: \"The movement of heaven flows without a moment’s interruption—how could there be a month without yang? Yet once it reaches fullness, it transforms; once it transforms, it changes. The great cycle spans a year and a month; the small cycle, a day and an hour—all follow this pattern. Like a tree whose leaves yellow and fall, the moment they fall, new buds have already sprouted. Trees that remain green in winter first grow new buds before their old leaves fall. When it comes to transformation, heaven and earth are never without change—not only in a year, but in a month; not only in a month, but in a day; not only in a day, but in an hour. It is only that people do not perceive it.\"\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why does the *hard fruit* not fall?\" He replied: \"Simply by not falling, it contains the principle of life. As Master Yichuan said: 'Yang has no principle of complete exhaustion; when it transforms above, it arises below.' *Nine at the top* of *Bo* is the image of the old yang above, the hard fruit. Earlier scholars spoke of peach pits and apricot kernels: the kernel inside the pit, when planted, sprouts—hence it is called *qi*. The kernel is the heart of heaven and earth in generating things; it is not a dead thing. The *Yi* speaks of *qi* only in the hexagrams *Fu* and *Qian*, revealing the heart of heaven and earth in generating things. From the first yin’s dissipation, *Qian* advances to *six in the fifth*, reaching its extreme. *Qian* represents wood and fruit; the yang essence solidifies above, and the *hard fruit* is the greatest of solid things—it appears when *Bo* reaches its extreme. When it reaches the top, it turns downward, and *Gen* inverted becomes *Fu*. Yang arises within the earth, then grows and becomes *Qian*—this is the image of the *hard fruit* that does not fall.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"*Fu* speaks of *qi* days to return—when things reach their extreme, they must reverse. This is the principle: there must be life and death, beginning and end. As it says: 'Bending and stretching, coming and going—it is only principle.' One must not take the qi that has just bent as the qi that is now stretching. It is naturally ceaseless. When things disperse, their qi is exhausted, and they cannot return. This is the principle of the original source. Heaven and earth are like a great furnace, melting and refining everything to exhaustion. How could the qi that has already dispersed return to the workings of creation? It is the life-generating qi that is used, not the already-dispersed qi. It is like the sea tide: when the sun rises, it ebbs; when the moon rises, it flows—not that the already-ebbed water becomes the tide.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"*Seven days* is taken only for the meaning of seven; *eight months bring misfortune* takes the meaning of eight, calling it *return*. It is not that the yang of the past is brought back anew to regenerate the old. What has passed is gone; the new naturally arises from it. The great virtue is earnest in transformation, flowing like a river without ceasing—how could it rely on the already-dissipated qi as the resource for what is now arising? It only shows that it perishes there and arises here, thereby revealing the image of its coming and going.\"\n\nMaster Cai said: \"Yang’s dissipation begins in the month of *Jianwu* (the fifth month) as *Bo*, and by the month of *Jianzi* (the eleventh month), it becomes *Fu*. The hexagram passes through seven lines, and the months pass through seven months. It does not speak of months but of days, just as in the *Book of Songs*: 'the first day, the second day.' Mr. Guo of Lushan said: '*Qian*’s *initial nine* returns at *jiazi*; the work of the year begins at the midnight of the winter solstice. The movement of the seven celestial bodies returns to the beginning of *Ox* (the lunar lodge), extending to the records of calendrical pitch-pipes. The sequence of the four seasons all reaches this point—thus the Yellow Bell is the root of all things. Therefore, when yang rises by one, all things are born; when yin rises by one, all things die. Their reversal and return complete the six positions, and the seasons are formed.\"\n\nThe *Yi* takes stillness as its root; heaven and earth take non-intention as their heart. Stillness follows *Kun*; movement follows *Zhen*. Thunder within the earth is the end of stillness and the beginning of movement.",

As soon as it reaches the southernmost point, it returns; upon returning, a single yang arises at *zi*, and the sun travels the northern celestial path—this is the winter solstice. Yet the initial yang is as faint as a thread, insufficient for action. It must pass through seven days to attain the number of *shaoyang* within the single yang, gaining three and a half parts out of fifteen. Only then does yang grow robust enough for action. Thus it is said: 'After seven days, the celestial movement returns.' The *hexagram* *Zhen* arises from the firm below, and life cannot be restrained. Only when plants wither and fruits fall to the earth do buds split their sheaths and the impulse of life return. *Yu*’s compliance in movement follows principle before qi; *Fu*’s movement in compliance follows qi before principle.\"\n\nMaster Liu said: \"The celestial movement cycles through twelve stages: yin traverses six, and yang traverses six. When yin reaches six and yang loses its position to seven, yang returns to its proper place. This is the cycle of the twelve celestial stages, revolving endlessly. The same pattern applies to years, months, days, and hours.\" Hanshang said: \"Judging by the waxing and waning of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams, a single day from noon to midnight returns to the *zi* hour; a single year from the fifth month to the eleventh month returns to the *zi* month. In terms of one cycle, from the *wu* year it takes nearly seven years to return to the *zi* year. The movement of the celestial Dao naturally follows this pattern, forming a single cycle. Divided into years, months, days, and hours, it is invariably the same. Thus the sixty hexagrams correspond to 360 days, with each pair of hexagrams separated by seven days. The sages preserved the 'seven days’ return' in the *Fu* hexagram to clarify the *qi* of the hexagrams.\"\n\nSomeone asked the foolish one: \"How does Master Shao’s *solstices* relate to exhalation and inhalation?\" The reply: \"After the winter solstice is exhalation; after the summer solstice is inhalation. Exhalation brings forth all things; inhalation draws them in. One year is one exhalation and inhalation—the great opening and closing of heaven and earth. After midnight is exhalation; before dusk is inhalation. Exhalation and inhalation unite yin and yang, forming a single whole in humans. In one day and night, a person has 13,600 breaths. Daytime exhalation responds to all affairs; nighttime inhalation brings the silence of the myriad sounds. Heaven and earth return to the single body, where exhalation and inhalation depend on speech and silence. *Fu* and *Gou* alternate, yang ascends and yin begins to yield.

      "translated_text": "**On the Origins of Numerology**\n\nThe study of numerology began with Fuxi, who drew the trigrams based on the *Hetu* (River Chart). Over seven hundred years later, Yu governed the floods and obtained the *Luoshu* (Luo River Writing). Another eleven hundred years passed before Jizi composed the *Hongqian*, clarifying the nine categories of the *Luoshu*. Confucius was born in the twenty-first year of King Ling of Zhou (gengxu), five hundred seventy years after Jizi. At seventy, he appended the *Xici* to the *Book of Changes*, elucidating the numerology of the *Hetu* within the fifty-five. Another fifteen hundred years passed before the *Huangji Jingshi* (Supreme Principles Governing the World) emerged. Its numerology did not devolve into mere elaboration because it was rooted in Fuxi’s pre-cosmic trigrams and their derivations. Those who do not speak of numerology find the pre-cosmic sufficient to encompass it. Thus, the transmission of numerology traces back: Fuxi received it and drew the trigrams; Confucius received it and expounded the *Dayan* (Great Expansion); Shao Yong (Kangjie) received it and composed the *Huangji Jingshi*. Its origins and evolution are ever more evident.\n\nAs for Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan*, Wei Yuan’s *Yuan Bao*, and Sima Guang’s *Qianxu*, they grasped only one facet of the *Changes* and did not attain its ultimate depth. Yet the numerology of the *Huangji Jingshi* is rarely mastered in the world, for its roots lie in *qi*, and its myriad transformations are difficult to fathom—unlike principles, which, once clarified in the mind, remain constant and easy to uphold. Thus, Confucius taught people only to \"exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny.\" When principle is clear, numerology is contained within it. Yet if numerology is unclear, principle is not easily refined.\n\nConfucius said: \"My Way is threaded by one.\" This suffices. Master Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is principle; yin and yang are *qi*. Movement and stillness are the mechanisms upon which they ride. *Qi* moves, and principle moves with it.\" Master Cai said: \"*Qi* is numerology. In the obscure and boundless, before the first signs emerge, lies the origin of numerology. The division of the One into Two marks the separation of numbers.\" I say: Before the Supreme Ultimate moves, *qi* is not yet manifest—how could numerology exist? Yet within the steadfast One, the Three are already latent. At the first stirrings of yang’s movement, a faint and indistinct numerological essence arises within, though it remains unmanifest. Where movement becomes evident, the One becomes distinct. When movement stabilizes and stillness ensues, the Two emerges. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement resumes, the Three is born. When movement reaches its extreme and stillness returns, the Four appears. From One to Three, and Three to Nine, yang numbers flow forth, giving rise to all things. From Two to Four, and Four to Eight, yin numbers congeal and solidify, forming the images of all things.\n\nThose who discern the mechanism see clearly and cultivate at the subtle, continuous point of yang. By steadfastly abiding until yin numbers—seven, eight, nine, and six—are reached, no errors arise, and all becomes auspicious. Yet if one’s heavenly mandate is predetermined, yang *qi* may sink into yin *qi*, giving rise to the nature of *qi*-quality. The noble person seeks to transform this by expanding and nurturing the yang goodness of principle. Thus, sages and worthies do not speak of destiny, focusing instead on principle to uphold the world’s teachings. Yet ultimately, they cannot escape it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of Four Greatnesses, which, together with the sage, make Five. Nothing surpasses heaven and earth in modeling the law; nothing surpasses the four seasons in facilitating transformation; nothing surpasses the sun and moon in displaying luminous images; and nothing surpasses milfoil and tortoiseshell in bringing about the auspicious and inauspicious in the world. Heaven and earth, the four seasons, the sun and moon, milfoil and tortoiseshell—all are manifestations of numerology. Without sages, how could one know heaven and earth as Three and Two, the four seasons as seven, eight, nine, and six, the days as one month, the *Hetu* as two, the *Luoshu* as ten, the tortoiseshell as nine, or the use of forty-nine out of fifty? This is the preparation of things for use, the creation of implements for the benefit of the world—nothing surpasses the sage, who dwells at the center and presides over all.\n\nThus, it is said: \"The sage emulates, images, and models them.\" It is also said: \"The *Changes* has four images, by which it reveals.\" Before Fuxi, there were no *Hetu* or *Luoshu*, only the natural *Changes* of heaven and earth. Thus, the *Hetu* is the *Changes* drawn by heaven and earth. The *Changes* is yin and yang, ceaseless transformation and alternation. Principle and numerology are inseparable—all are the natural *Changes*. At the dawn of chaos, when people were simple and most knowledgeable, heaven displayed these numbers through the sun, moon, and stars above, while earth presented them through the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* below. Fuxi, the first to arise, revealed these numbers to humanity. From Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, they were transmitted in an unbroken line to the present. Branches and leaves are drawn from the root, and within branches and leaves, the root is sought. Though myriad transformations differ, the One remains. Those with insight should devote themselves to this.\n\nI note: The *Records of the Grand Historian* states that Fuxi first drew the eight trigrams, created written characters, and replaced knotted cords. The Yellow Emperor’s teacher, Da Nao, investigated the essence of the Five Phases and first devised the *jiazi* (sexagenary cycle). He commanded Rong Cheng to create the calendar and establish numerology. Bamboo from Xiegu was used to listen to the phoenix’s song: the male’s six cries became the six *lü* (yang pitches), and the female’s six cries became the six *lü* (yin pitches). From the harmonious sounds of *gong* and *shang*, the numerology of *lü* and *lü* arose. Before Wu Huai and Tian Huang, records are distant and obscure. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states that from the beginning of creation to the capture of the lin, nearly 3,276,000 years passed.",

Thus, in the great process of transformation, one *yuan* of 129,600 years is no more than a single year’s span.\"\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Fifteen, concludes.\n\n*Tianyuan Fawei*, Scroll Sixteen, compiled by Bao Yunlong Jingxiang of Luzhai, collated by Fang Hui Wuli of Xugu.",

      "translated_text": "The ten epochs span nearly seventy-six thousand years. Had Fuxi not drawn the trigrams and established numerology, how could generations be recorded? Cai Jitong remarked that Shao Kangjie’s calculations originated with Fuxi—this must be thoroughly understood. Master Zhu said: \"He merely perceived a principle and drew a few strokes; how could he have arranged them with such swift ingenuity? Had he arranged them one by one, it would not have been the intent of Heaven.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"Fuxi was most pure and sincere; he created the eight trigrams—where would there be such swift and ingenious arrangement?\"\n\nIt further says: The Five resides at the center, serving as the *qi* of Heaven and Earth in equilibrium. The celestial Five dwells at the pole of the celestial sphere, threading through the four seasons; the terrestrial Five resides at the center of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, governing the four directions. In the diagram, five points represent Earth at the center. The outer four points are: Water in the north, Fire in the south, Wood in the east, and Metal in the west.\n\nWithin the *wu-si* pitch, the *Huangzhong* note holds the central position. The notes of the four seasons—*jue* in spring, *zhi* in summer, *shang* in autumn, and *yu* in winter—each differ, except for this central note, *gong*. Jing Fang’s pitch regulator consists of twelve strings, with the central string as *Huangzhong*, remaining unmoved; the twelve strings then resonate in response. The Five resides at the center of the twelve months, and when doubled, the Five never departs from the center.\n\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five. The *Dayan* calculation uses fifty, with the central Five as the *qi* of Heaven and Earth in equilibrium. The void at the center, formless and undifferentiated, is the Supreme Ultimate. When it divides, the first signs of form and transformation emerge—this is the primordial *qi* of Heaven. The initial transformation emerges in the north to generate Water, hence Water’s number is one. This \"one\" as a number derives from its status as the first transformation.\n\nThe second transformation emerges in the south to generate Fire, hence Fire’s number is two. This \"two\" as a number derives from the second transformation of one. The third transformation emerges in the east to generate Wood, hence Wood’s number is three. This \"three\" as a number derives from the third transformation of one. The fourth transformation generates Metal in the west, its number four, likewise deriving from the fourth transformation of one. Though two, three, and four all derive their names from one, they are collectively called the \"generative numbers.\" Yet this one, having initially emerged from the Five to generate, ultimately returns to the Five to complete its internal formation. Internal and external, generation and completion, are unified in the Five Phases. Thus it is said: Earth is the *qi* of equilibrium, the essence, the ruler of the Five Phases. The Five generates and completes itself, initially requiring nothing. That which is completed by the Five is also doubled to become ten.\n\nIn the *Luo River Writing*, whether vertical, horizontal, or curved, all do not depart from three and five—this is the same principle. This celestial number Five, multiplying without decline and entering without loss, accomplishes transformations and moves spirits.\n\nThe *Dayan* number is fifty, of which forty-nine are used. The *ce* of *Qian* number 216, and the *ce* of *Kun* number 144, together total 360, corresponding to the days of a year. The *ce* of the two hexagrams total 11,520, corresponding to the number of all things.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Dayan* number is the origin of calculation methods. Thus, the foundation of calculation arises from nothing more than squares, circles, curves, and straight lines. Yang has no ten; yin has no one. Multiplication is the generative number; division is the dissipative number. Though calculation methods are many, they do not exceed these.\n\nZhang said: Yin and yang are nothing more than waxing and waning; calculation is nothing more than multiplication and division. Multiplication is the application of two. Squares, circles, curves, and straight lines are the four forms. The *Dayan* employs the Four Images as the origin of calculation. Yin ascends and yang descends within the Four Images, resulting in six.\n\nThis fool says: Seeking it in the Primordial Heaven, the circle of Heaven has the number three, and its transformations proceed: three to six, six to seven, seven to nine. The square of Earth has the number four, and its transformations proceed: four to eight, eight to six, six to nine. Heaven becomes Earth, Earth becomes Heaven. The interweaving of curves and straight lines, their numbers interlocking and alternating, yield inexhaustible transformations.\n\nThe *Yi* has its methods: *Qian* uses the old yang nine, *Kun* uses the old yin six. The *Dayan* uses four, the number of the Four Images. Four multiplied by nine yields thirty-six, the *ce* number of one line in *Qian*. Six multiplied by thirty-six yields 216, the *ce* number of one hexagram in *Qian*. Alternatively, multiplying thirty-six by six also yields this number. Four multiplied by six yields twenty-four, the *ce* number of one line in *Kun*. Six multiplied by twenty-four yields 144, the *ce* number of one hexagram in *Kun*. Alternatively, multiplying twenty-four by six also yields this number.\n\nThirty-six multiplied by four also corresponds to the *ce* of the two hexagrams. Thirty-two yang hexagrams have 192 yang lines, each line thirty-six. Thirty-two yin hexagrams have 192 yin lines, each line twenty-four. Multiplying 216 by thirty-two: thirty-two times two hundred yields 6,400; thirty-two times ten yields 320; thirty-two times six yields 192. Combined, they total 6,912—the number obtained by multiplying 216 by thirty-two.\n\nMultiplying 144 by thirty-two: thirty-two times one hundred yields 3,200; thirty-two times forty yields 1,280; thirty-two times four yields 128. Combined, they total 4,608—the number obtained by multiplying 144 by thirty-two. This explanation is indeed detailed and clear.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, each yang hexagram contains 216, and multiplying this by the thirty-two yang hexagrams likewise yields 6,912. Each yin hexagram contains 144, and multiplying this by the thirty-two yin hexagrams likewise yields 4,608. Combined, they total 11,520—is this not simpler and easier?\n\nThe *Yijing* employs the old to enact change, hence the counting rods of *Qian* and *Kun* are used. Yet if one combines the counting rods of the two lesser hexagrams from the two Wings, the result is the same. This pertains to a fundamental principle in the study of the *Yijing*, which scholars must not overlook.\n\nConfucius appended this method to the *Yijing*, yet later Confucians failed to explain it with clarity and concision. Shao Kangjie once received this transmission from Chen Tuan, but over time forgot it. One night, he was instructed in a dream and regained it—yet even this was difficult, let alone for later students. Now I am old, and after delving into these calculations, I have recorded them in detail here. If students of the *Yijing* grasp this, then the numbers may be effortlessly unraveled.\n\nThe numbers beneath the earth cannot be reckoned. Yet the old and young of yin and yang, of heaven and earth and humanity, and the sixteen images of four-by-four can all be deduced by analogy. Only the numbers beneath the earth remain hidden and difficult to infer. Thus it is said: the subtle images in the world, the forms upon the earth, and the spirits dwelling in the unseen—none are not bound to number; it is merely that people do not perceive them.\n\nThe correct tones and numbers operate upon the earth and no further, for on the summer solstice, the sun rises in *yin* and sets in *xu*. Thus the three hours of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* descend beneath the earth, and their numbers are unseen.\n\nMaster Cheng said: Kangjie once exhaustively explored flavors numbering 21,600—something no human could blend. Colors number 28,800—something no human could dye. These are all natural, singular numerical patterns, yet only half are obtained. For yang tones arise only when the sun emerges above the earth, and their numbers are reckoned only until the sun sets beneath it. This is all reasonable.\n\nWhere there is speech, there is form; where there is form, there is shadow concealed. How enduring is shadow? The *Guabian* states: one, two, three, four—these numbers lie beneath the earth. At five, they emerge above it. Only then do the beginnings of human life appear, with signs visible to the eye. By six, seven, eight, and nine, they become manifest.\n\nThe sages relied on the numbers of heaven and earth to uphold yang and suppress yin. The heavenly number is twenty-five, the earthly number thirty—these are the fundamental numbers of heaven and earth. Earth exceeds by five, hence the *Dayan* number of fifty is employed. Heaven exceeds by ten—why? It is the sages’ way of upholding yang and suppressing yin.\n\nTwo and eight, four and six—these are the numbers of earth, yielding only two. One and nine, three and seven, five and five—these are the numbers of heaven, yielding three. Thus the heavenly number is thirty, exceeding earth. Moreover, the yang number three advances to employ the greater number of thirty, while the yin numbers four and six retreat to employ the lesser number of twelve.\n\nFrom this, we deduce: heaven three and earth two make five; heaven six and earth four make ten; *Qian* nine and *Kun* six make fifteen. *Qian* yields thirty-six, *Kun* yields twenty-four. *Qian* obtains six times seven, totaling 252—the time of generating life. *Kun* obtains only three times six, totaling 108—merely to restrain life.\n\nThe sages established these numbers by relying on the flowing transformations of creation—how profound and subtle! Zhen Xishan recorded the words of Cai Yinjun, saying: \"The *Yijing*’s images embody the workings of heaven and earth. The *Fan*’s numbers record them. Numbers begin with the odd one; images are completed by the even two. The odd is how numbers operate; the even is how images stand. Thus two by four makes eight—the images of the eight trigrams. Three by three makes nine—the numbers of the nine categories.\n\nEight by eight, multiplied again by eight, yields 4,096, and the images are complete. Nine by nine, multiplied again by nine, yields 6,561, and the numbers are exhaustive. The *Yijing*’s images were revealed through four sages, while the *Fan*’s numbers were bestowed upon Yu the Great by the gods, yet they were not transmitted. Later scholars, ignorant of the origins of images and numbers, either derived numbers from images or contrived images from numbers, forcing interpretations and obscuring the natural numerical patterns.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s eight trigrams, when expanded, form 4,096 images—Jing Fang exhaustively detailed them. Cai Zhongmo said: \"My late father said that the *Luoshu* is the origin of numbers. Without understanding numbers, one cannot discuss images. Without understanding images, one cannot discuss numbers. The two cannot exist without each other. Images are employed through the even, and when there is resonance, it is auspicious. Numbers are employed through the odd, and when there is opposition, it is inauspicious.\n\nThe even represents the mutual opposition of yin and yang as images. The odd represents the alternating operation of yin and yang as numbers. One is the ancestor of nine; nine is the ancestor of eighty-one. One and nine form a beginning and end as one—just as the year begins and ends at the winter solstice. The nine numbers divide into nine circles; when rotated and counted, the eight solar terms are complete.\n\nTwo by two marks *Lichun*; three by three, *Chunfen*; four by four, *Lixia*; five by five, *Xiazhi*; six by six, *Liqiu*; seven by seven, *Qiufen*; eight by eight, *Lidong*; nine by nine, *Dongzhi*. When the nine numbers conclude, one is reborn—generation upon generation without end. Yin ends and yang begins; day ends and night begins; the year ends and spring begins. The end of the former heaven and earth is the beginning of the latter—all without departing from the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*.\n\nOne by nine makes nine; nine by nine makes eighty-one; eighty-one by nine makes 729; 729 by nine makes 6,561—and the numbers are complete.\"",

      "translated_text": "The movement of odd numbers establishes the foundation for the forms of even numbers. Thus it is said: the eight trigrams and nine palaces serve as each other’s exterior and interior.\n\nSomeone asked about the primordial numbers. Master Zhu replied: *The Great Commentary* has already explained this in detail. The *Kun* hexagram of Earth is the ancestor of the sixty-four hexagrams. The *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the origin of numbers, the source from which the sages drew the trigrams.\n\nOne view holds: The Supreme Ultimate is the origin of principle, while the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* are the ancestors of numbers. From Heaven One to Earth Ten, Fuxi used the numbers of the *Hetu* to draw the trigrams. The fifty-five are the numbers through which Confucius elucidated the numbers of heaven and earth. The fifty of the *Dayan* are the numbers of the milfoil stalks. The 360 of *Qian* and *Kun* are the numbers of the annual cycle. The 11,520 are the numbers of the myriad things—all are primordial numbers. The numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* encompass all without exception.\n\nKing Wen ordered the *Yijing*, placing *Qian* and *Kun* at the beginning. The alternation of yang’s odd and yin’s even lines begins with the division of the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams. Thus, when Fuxi drew the primordial trigrams, he began with *Qian* and ended with *Kun*, enclosing the sixty-two hexagrams within them. This is because the numbers of all things under heaven are encompassed within *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\n*Qian* is Heaven, and its number begins with one. One contains three, and three times three makes nine. All the odd numbers of the world—one, three, five, seven, nine—are derived from this. Thus, the Dao of *Qian* completes the male, giving rise to the *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* trigrams, which disperse through the four seasons. Whether human or thing, all receive the qi of *Qian*.\n\n*Kun* is Earth, and its number begins with two. Three times two makes six, containing twelve lines in its midst. All the even numbers of the world—two, four, six, eight, ten—are derived from this. Thus, the Dao of *Kun* completes the female, giving rise to the *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* trigrams, which disperse through the four seasons. Whether human or thing, all receive the qi of *Kun*.\n\nOne odd and one even, forming yin and yang, the male and female interlock—all through the numbers of four nines, four sixes, four sevens, and four eights. Generation and transformation flow abundantly within, circulating without cease. Counting forward or backward, all movements converge with these numbers.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven moves left in sequence, which is why the five phases generate one another. The Dao of Heaven moves right in reverse, which is why the five phases overcome one another. Overcoming is the means by which they complete one another. Thus it is said: The numbers of the *Yijing* are completed through reversal. *The Commentary on the Trigrams* states: The *Yijing* counts in reverse. It also says: Counting what has passed is sequence; knowing what is to come is reversal. This is what it means.\n\nMaster Shao said: Before thoughts arise, even spirits and gods do not know. If not from me, then from whom? Master Yi said: Only with Kangjie did numerology fully attain principle. Master Liu Yunzhuang said: The lines of the *Yijing* arise from the Supreme Ultimate, and thus its principles are the most refined under heaven. The *Yijing* originates from the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, and thus its numbers are the most mutable under heaven. Principle is established only when it has something to rely upon; though it does not depend solely on the numbers of the *Hetu* and *Luoshu*, it also does not depart from them.\n\nHe also said: Ten is two fives, or three threes with one added. Subtract three from ten and you get seven; subtract two and you get eight; subtract one and you get nine; subtract four and you get six. Six is then increased by four, nine by one, and seven by three. Advancing and retreating, expanding and contracting—all movements converge with these numbers. The four images do not depart from ten.\n\nIn terms of division: one divides into two, two into four, four into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, and thirty-two into sixty-four. Thus it is said: Dividing yin and dividing yang, alternating the yielding and the firm. Ten divides into a hundred, a hundred into a thousand, a thousand into ten thousand, and so on—ten ten-thousands into a hundred thousand, ten hundred-thousands into a million, ten millions into ten million, ten ten-millions into a hundred million, and below a hundred million: *shu*, *rang*, *gou*, *jian*, *zheng*, *zai*, and *ji*. Fifteen names in all, yet none depart from ten.\n\nRoots have trunks, trunks have branches, branches have leaves. The larger they grow, the finer they become; the finer they become, the more numerous they grow. Yang, beginning with *Zhen*, grows until *Qian* and then divides; yin, beginning with *Xun*, arises until *Kun* and then contracts. Growth, division, decline, and contraction—this is simply the movement of the ten numbers.\n\nThus, Master Cheng said: Two and five combine to accomplish the work of yin and yang. Master Shao said: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* are the ancestors of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Xun*, *Dui*, *Gen*, and *Zhen* are the ancestors of the twenty-eight hexagrams. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, along with the doubled hexagrams *Zhongfu*, *Yi*, *Xiaoguo*, and *Daguo*—eight hexagrams in all that do not change—are the ancestors of the thirty-six hexagrams. The thirty-six hexagrams are the two sets of eighteen hexagrams in the upper and lower canons.\n\nThe *Dui*, *Xun*, *Zhen*, and *Gen* trigrams are transformations of the two original hexagrams, and thus are the ancestors of the twenty-eight changing hexagrams. Twenty-eight: among the thirty-six hexagrams, eight do not change, while twenty-eight do. Observing them in reverse yields fifty-six hexagrams. Why then speak of thirty-six hexagrams?\n\n*Qian* is one and *Kun* is eight. Among a hundred numbers, sixty-four hexagrams are taken as the body, and thirty-six as the function. One to ten is complete, and ten to a hundred is complete. *Kun*’s position above yields thirty-six for function, and below yields sixty-four for body. The inner yin lines complete the body’s numbers, totaling a hundred. Ten recedes by eight, and eight eights make sixty-four. Eight recedes by two, and six sixes make thirty-six.\n\nSome hexagrams contain seven within nine: four nines (thirty-six) contain four sevens (twenty-eight). Some hexagrams contain eight within seven: four sevens (twenty-eight) contain seven eights (fifty-six).",

Yin ends and yang begins; day ends and night begins; the year ends and spring begins.

      "translated_text": "Some hexagrams contain sixty-four within eight: this refers to the eight lower hexagrams remaining unchanged while being doubled to form sixty-four—condensing the expansive. There are those where the Dipper contains three within: when the sixty-four hexagrams are observed in reverse, only thirty-six remain—expanding the condensed. Some conceal nine within eight, yielding one eight, two sevens, three sixes, four fives. This is also called the intersecting numbers of four nines, where all nine bodies are concealed within eight. Thus their forms are inexhaustible. Some conceal nine within ten: the Nine Categories contain the numbers of five nines, with nine matters in substance. The Six Adversities attach to the Five Fortunes, so ten is unseen and concealed within nine. When function conceals form, its use is unceasing.\n\nIt is also said: *Qian* employs thirty-six hexagrams, so each line also contains thirty-six numbers. *Kun* employs twenty-four hexagrams, so each line also contains twenty-four numbers. The sixty-four hexagrams correspond to a year’s three hundred sixty days. *Qian*’s one hexagram has six lines, each line thirty-six numbers, six lines totaling two hundred sixteen—this is the line count of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Kun* is allotted twenty-four hexagrams, complementing *Qian* to complete the sixty-four. Each line has twenty-four, six lines totaling one hundred forty-four—this is the line count of *Kun*’s twenty-four hexagrams. Together, *Kun* and *Qian* complete three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven’s numbers employ seven. Of heaven’s ten numbers, seven is for use, three for intersection. Earth’s numbers employ twelve, eight for use, four for intersection. *Qian*’s original single line, multiplied by thirty-six, yields two hundred sixteen. Now adding six to its numbers. *Kun*’s original single line, multiplied by twenty-four, yields one hundred forty-four. Taking one portion to offer *Qian*, it uses only three sixes—one hundred eight—corresponding to the three hours of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*. One day, one month, one year—all these numbers move beneath the earth and are not employed by humans.\n\nAt times, seven of ten parts are used, following heaven’s use, referring to the Ten Celestial Stems. At times, seven, eight, or nine of twelve parts are used, following earth’s use, referring to the Twelve Earthly Branches. Using seven, two hundred ten are for use, one hundred fifty for intersection. Using eight, two hundred forty are for use, one hundred twenty for intersection. Using nine, two hundred seventy are for use, ninety for intersection. Thus it is said: the numbers of days follow heaven, the numbers of hours follow earth. Numbers have excess and deficiency, arising between the two solstices.\n\nFrom the hours’ two thousand one hundred comes the yang extreme, the surplus of qi. Yang gains six days—these are the mid-month qi of each month. Six becomes twelve, and yang advances twelve days to make one hundred twenty. From the hours’ two thousand one hundred sixty comes the yin extreme, the new moon’s deficiency. Yin contracts six days—these are the new moon’s deficiencies of each month. Six becomes twelve, and yin retreats twelve days to make one hundred twenty, totaling two hundred forty. Paired with twelve to make twenty-four, the great cycle’s standard number is sixty days per division, while the intercalary number is six days per division. These are distributed among the twenty-four qi, with twelve mid-month excesses and twelve new moon deficiencies, totaling twenty-four—dividing the cycle into four. Day and night divide their use, thus employing two hundred fifty-two.\n\nIt is also said: numbers have form and function. Form numbers generate beings and belong to earth; function numbers govern movement and belong to heaven. The form number is three hundred eighty-four, comprising sixty hexagrams. The line count is three hundred eighty-four, with four as form, so three hundred sixty lines are for function. Adding the sixty-four hexagrams, preserving *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*’s four hexagrams—twenty-four lines—governing the twenty-four qi, then three hundred sixty lines serve as a year’s function. Preserving ninety lines as form, fifteen hexagrams’ two hundred seventy lines are the numbers of heaven and earth’s function—these are the numbers of *yin* opening and *xu* closing. Preserving one hundred lines as form, eighteen hexagrams’ two hundred fifty-two lines are the numbers of earth’s surface function—these are the months from *yin* to *you*, including intercalary months. Excluding the hexagrams of the three palaces *hai*, *zi*, and *chou*, one hundred eight days—form contains function, function contains form.\n\nPreserving the Supreme Ultimate’s form, the remainder is heaven’s function. Preserving heaven’s form, the remainder is earth’s function. Preserving earth’s form, the remainder is humanity’s function. The actual functional number is two hundred sixty-four—this is the number of pitch pipes, humanity, and beings. Two hundred fifty-six is the number of *Kan* and *Li* generating beings, adding four to earth’s form number two hundred fifty-two to make six, so two hundred fifty-six days have three thousand seventy-two hours—all times for generating beings. Beings are born of yang, so only yang strategies are employed. *Qian*’s yang is thirty-six, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Xun* together total eighty-four. *Kun* is twelve, *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen* together total sixty. Altogether, the eight positions’ yang lines total one hundred ninety-two, plus the original generating four numbers of sixty-four, making two hundred fifty-six.\n\nIt is also said: of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding the initial and top lines and using only the four middle lines, two hundred fifty-six are also obtained. Using four positions refers to the four earthly forms. *Kan* has four yin lines, *Li* has four yang lines—thus generation of beings necessarily employs four. *Qian* and *Kun* establish positions above and below, while *Kan* and *Li* mate within them, serving as the masters of generating beings, gestating their essence and spirit. Excluding the initial and top lines and using only the middle lines is because heaven and earth do not generate beings at dawn and dusk but do at midday, and earth’s north and south do not generate beings but do at midday. If *Li* were not preserved, the four yang lines would have no way to receive *Kun*’s yin. If *Kan* were not preserved, the four yin lines would have no way to accept *Qian*’s yang. Thus each excludes four to establish form. Excluding four means they are constantly preserved yet unused, while two hundred fifty-six are employed.",

      "translated_text": "The initial line is the qi of earth, the root of life. In the *Precelestial Chart*, the thirty-two yang and thirty-two yin lines that remain unchanged are the initial lines left unused. The top line is the spirit of heaven, the origin of nature. Thus, the eight pure hexagrams evolve through five generations to become the \"wandering soul\" of heaven, and the top line of the *Yijing* does not move.\n\nMaster Shao said: The *Yijing* possesses variable numbers, and hexagrams possess variable images. Heaven’s number contains three; doubling three makes six, and tripling three makes nine. Nine times nine is eighty-one, the extreme of yang numbers. At its extreme, yang transforms into yin. Earth’s two doubled makes four, and four times four is sixty-four, the extreme of yin numbers. At its extreme, yin transforms into yang.\n\nThere are hexagram transformations: one change yields three—*Qian* transforms into *Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*; *Kun* transforms into *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*. One change yields eight—*Qian* shifts from *Gou* to *Tai*, and *Kun* shifts from *Bo* to *Pi*. Among the hexagrams of the three outer sons and three outer daughters, one shares the same variable hexagrams, as observed through the casting of yarrow stalks. Obtaining the two elders’ nine-six changes results in *Qian* and *Kun*. Obtaining the two youths’ seven-eight unchanged lines results in *Zhen*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*.\n\nThere are line transformations: for example, *Kun* changes one line to become *Fu*, and when all six lines change, it becomes *Qian*. Another method involves the mutual ascent of one yang line as a transformation, yielding *Fu*, *Shi*, *Jian*, *Yu*, *Bi*, and *Bo*. There are also transformations of two yang lines, comprising fifteen hexagrams, all derived from *Lin*. Transformations of three yang lines comprise ten hexagrams, all derived from *Tai*.\n\n*Qian* changes one line to become *Gou*, and when all six lines change, it becomes *Kun*. Another method involves the mutual transformation of one yin line, generating *Gou*, *Fu*, *Lü*, *Xiaoxu*, and *Dayou*. There are also transformations of two yin lines, comprising fifteen hexagrams, all derived from *Dun*. Transformations of three yin lines comprise ten hexagrams, all derived from *Pi*. These describe transformations of lines and hexagrams.\n\nThe eight trigrams’ transformations, eight times eight, culminate in sixty-four. The sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations, sixty-four times sixty-four, culminate in four thousand ninety-six hexagrams. By extrapolating hexagram lines, these are twelve-line hexagrams. Extending to twenty-four lines yields seventeen million seven hundred seventy-seven thousand two hundred sixteen hexagrams.\n\nFurthermore, in the *Precelestial Chart*, one change yields two hexagrams, two changes yield four, three changes yield eight, four changes yield sixteen, five changes yield thirty-two, and six changes complete the sixty-four hexagrams. The square and circular *Precelestial Charts* correspond precisely. Thus, Master Shao states below: \"Changes within correspond to responses without; changes without correspond to responses within. Changes below correspond to responses above; changes above correspond to responses below.\"\n\n*Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* with twenty-eight yang lines correspond to *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen*’s twenty-eight yin lines. *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Zhen*’s twenty yang lines correspond to *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*’s twenty yin lines. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Xun*, and *Kan* occupy the upper position, while *Li*, *Zhen*, *Gen*, and *Kun* occupy the lower. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* are internal, while *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun* are external. As yang wanes and yin waxes, each hexagram mirrors the other, and there is no change without correspondence.\n\nChange follows heaven. Heaven moves leftward, and the sun shifts one degree; the response follows the sun’s daily rightward movement, with heaven responding one degree. All correspond left and right. The sun’s path is marked by stars—*Qian* and *Li*; the moon meets the celestial stems—*Dui* and *Zhen*; fire arises from earth—*Kun* and *Kan*; fire lies hidden in stone—*Gen* and *Xun*. All correspond above and below.\n\nFlying creatures perch on trees—*Li* and *Gen*; walking creatures rely on grass—*Zhen* and *Kun*; heart and lungs connect—*Qian* and *Xun*; liver and gallbladder adjoin—*Dui* and *Kan*. All correspond internally and externally. Thus, in the *Yijing*’s six lines, the first and fourth correspond, the second and fifth correspond, and the third and sixth correspond, always in opposition.\n\nHeaven and earth envelop each other; the female and male summon one another. Heaven is yang, earth is yin; heaven’s pitch corresponds to earth’s tone. Heaven’s voice initiates, and earth responds. *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* reside in the northwest, initiating earth’s sixteen hexagrams—five, six, seven, eight—in the southeast. They further intersect with the sixteen hexagrams of the southwest—*Pi*, *Dun*, *Song*, and *Shi*—constituting the transformations of heat and cold, day and night, the natures and forms of walking, flying, and plant life. The sixteen hexagrams of movement combine to form two hundred fifty-six hexagrams, their positions aligning with thirty-four changes. All successes and failures, virtues and flaws of animals arise from this.\n\nEarth’s tone harmonizes with heaven. *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* reside in the southeast, harmonizing with heaven’s sixteen hexagrams—one, two, three, four—in the northwest. They further intersect with the sixteen hexagrams of the northeast—*Tai*, *Lin*, *Yi*, *Fu*—constituting the transformations of rain, wind, dew, and thunder, the natures and forms of walking, flying, and plant life. The sixteen hexagrams of vegetation combine to form two hundred fifty-six hexagrams, their positions aligning with thirty-one changes. All flourishing and withering, blossoming and fruiting of plants arise from this.\n\nThe hexagrams of the southwest, observed from left to right, pertain to animals. Animals’ lives reside in the head, attached to heaven, with yang arising below. Among the thirty-two hexagrams below, all lines face upward—life resides above. Thus, humans’ heads are above, while birds and beasts are born horizontally. The hexagrams of the northeast, observed from top to bottom, pertain to plants. Plants’ lives reside in the roots, attached to earth, with yin arising above. Among the thirty-two hexagrams above, all lines face downward—life resides below. Thus, humans’ kidneys are below, while grasses and trees grow inverted.\n\nThen, pairing them with the hexagrams of sound: the voices of the sun, moon, and stars belong to heaven’s one hundred twelve hexagrams. The tones of water, fire, earth, and stone belong to earth’s one hundred fifty-two hexagrams.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven and earth undergo sixteen changes, totaling six hundred seventy-two divisions of waxing and waning. Heaven’s eight leftward changes, from *Zi* to *Si*, constitute daytime, with three hundred thirty-six as the number of growth.",
      "overlap_context": "the middle lines is because heaven and earth do not generate beings at dawn and dusk but do at midday, and earth’s north and south do not generate beings but do at midday. If *Li* were not preserved, the four yang lines would have no way to receive *Kun*’s yin. If *Kan* were not preserved, the four yin lines would have no way to accept *Qian*’s yang. Thus each excludes four to establish form. Excluding four means they are constantly preserved yet unused, while two hundred fifty-six are employed.",

      "translated_text": "Earth’s eight rightward changes, from *Wu* to *Hai*, constitute night, with three hundred thirty-six as the number of waning. Together, the two eights make sixteen changes. Heaven governs the body, its eight changes culminating in sixteen. With *Qian* as the master, proceeding from *Yang* onward, two hexagrams correspond to one change, *Tongren* to eight changes, and *Shen* to sixteen changes.\n\nHeaven and earth each divide into eight changes, each yielding the number three hundred thirty-six—the total line count of fifty-six hexagrams. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, excluding *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Daguo*, *Xiaoguo*, *Zhongfu*, and *Yi*, twenty-four lines remain. Dividing twenty-four by two yields twelve, which is the surplus of six days in the yang count. For the six yin months, totaling one hundred eighty days, excluding the twenty-four lines of *Kun*, *Kan*, *Daguo*, and *Xiaoguo*, twenty-four lines remain. Dividing twenty-four by two yields twelve, which is the deficit of six days in the yin count. Together, the twenty-four lines excluded account for the three hundred thirty-six, combining into six hundred seventy-two divisions of waxing and waning. This also corresponds to the changes of seven, six, five, and four.\n\nThe generative numbers of the eight trigrams: *Qian* as one, *Dui* as two, *Li* as three, *Zhen* as four, *Xun* as five, *Kan* as six, *Gen* as seven, *Kun* as eight.\n\nMaster Cai states: Yang generates yin, two multiplied by six becomes twelve. Yin generates yang, three multiplied by ten becomes thirty. Thus, *Qian* begins with one, and *Dui* becomes twelve; *Li* becomes twelve and thirty, totaling three hundred sixty; *Zhen* becomes twelve and four thousand three hundred twenty. From *Xun* to *Kun*, all are the generative numbers of odd and even. Applying these to the twenty-four hexagrams and multiplying their generative numbers reveals the total sum. From *Dui* to *Zhen*, the number reaches one hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred twenty. I have calculated this before.\n\nYang, as one, is odd; yin, as two, is even. Thus, the number of one *yuan* begins with *Qian*, the origin of all counts, just as one year encompasses years, months, days, and hours. After *Qian* comes *Dui*. *Dui* represents the moon, its number two. Expanded, it becomes twelve—one year has twelve months. After *Dui* comes *Li*. *Li* represents the sun, its number three. Expanded, it becomes three hundred sixty—one year has three hundred sixty days. After *Li* comes *Zhen*. *Zhen* represents the hours, its number four. Expanded, it becomes four thousand three hundred twenty—one year has four thousand three hundred twenty hours. These one, two, three, and four are the primordial numbers of heaven and earth’s creation, where yang precedes yin by one.\n\nAfter *Zhen* four comes *Xun* five. Nothing precedes this as the primordial qi of yin. This is the year count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred, the origin of all counts. *Kan* six follows, representing the month count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to one million five hundred fifty-five thousand two hundred months. *Gen* seven follows, representing the day count of *Xun Yuan*, expanded to forty-six million six hundred fifty-six thousand days. As for the hour count of *Xun*, it resides in *Kun* eight, further expanded to fifty-five million nine hundred eighty-seven thousand two hundred hours. These five, six, seven, and eight are the concluding numbers of heaven and earth’s completion, where yin follows yang.\n\nThus, layering and expanding these to eight: *Qian*’s world count is four thousand three hundred twenty, expanded to fifty-five million nine hundred eighty-seven thousand two hundred. *Dui*’s world count is fifty-one thousand eight hundred forty, expanded to six hundred seventy-one million eight hundred forty-six thousand four hundred. Proceeding in order, all can be clearly discerned. Generally, the numbers of *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* encompass those of *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. From *Zi* to *Si*, the six upper branches belong to *Qian*, called *xiantian* (Prior Heaven). From *Wu* to *Hai*, the six lower branches belong to *Kun*, called *houtian* (Posterior Heaven). Posterior Heaven emulates Prior Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Forming the image is called *Qian*; emulating the model is called *Kun*.\" One may infer the rest from this.\n\nTwelve and thirty are used interchangeably. The twelve months of a year arise from one year multiplied by twelve. The three hundred sixty days of a year arise from twelve multiplied by thirty. The four thousand three hundred twenty hours of a year arise from three hundred sixty multiplied by twelve. The thirty *shi* of a world arise from one *shi* multiplied by thirty. The three hundred sixty months of a world arise from the world count multiplied by thirty. The ten thousand eighty days of a world arise from the world’s days multiplied by thirty. The one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred hours of a world arise from the world’s days multiplied by twelve.\n\nThe twelve branches and twelve stations correspond to the numbers three, four, two, and six. Doubling twelve yields three, eight, four, and six. The yin number two expands to twelve: twelve branches, twelve hours, twelve months, twelve worlds, twelve hexagrams. *Kun* has twelve lines; humans have twelve components—thus earth’s numbers begin with twelve. The twelve branches are the branch numbers and month numbers. From *Zi* to *Si* is yang; from *Wu* to *Hai* is yin—this is two sixes, divided by generation and completion. From *Zi* to *Xu* is yang; from *Chou* to *Hai* is yin—this is also two sixes, divided by odd and even. Twelve yin and yang each form half, splitting one into two and dividing the twelve. Four threes and two sixes: the four seasons each split into three, further dividing the two sixes. Twenty-four corresponds to the twelve qi of the months. Eight nodes: one node has three qi. Four seasons: one season has six qi.\n\nThe lines of the eight trigrams in Prior Heaven’s one palace each total forty-eight, divided among the four directions to correspond to the four phases.",

      "translated_text": "The central void of twelve corresponds to earth, aligning with the four directions. In *Jiazi*, it holds twelve; in *Zhouyi*, one hexagram; in *Kun*, twelve yang remain; in *Qian*, twelve yin remain. Forty-eight is twelve. Subtract twelve and use thirty-six as old yang. From *Yin* to *Xu*, three are used and one unused—twenty-four: remove four sixes and use four sixes as old yin. From *Mao* to *Shen*, remove six and use six, each half. Twenty-eight: remove four fives and use four sevens. Thirty-two: remove four fours and use four eights. Whether from the middle of *Yin* to the middle of *Xu*, or from *Mao* to *You*, the used always exceeds the unused, marking the advance and retreat of *Qian* and *Kun*. These twelve numbers divide day and night, and the moon’s waxing and waning. Advancing twelve days, yang gains; retreating twelve days, yin contracts. When yang gains, the surplus of qi divides six into one hundred twenty; when yin contracts, the deficiency of qi also divides six into one hundred twenty. Six days advance, sixty days advance—paired, they make twenty-four—hence the use of two hundred forty-two, two hundred fifty-two, and two hundred sixty-four. One year has sixty *Jiazi*; small, it is six hours; large, six days. Even larger, sixty years—all twelve. Thus it is said: \"Six *Jia* exhaust the heavenly Dao,\" and the moon uses thirty days as its mean. The midpoint of half a day is the conjunction of sun and moon. Excluding intercalary months also aligns with the numbers of one palace—though none have spoken of this before. *Qian* uses nine, *Kun* uses six. *Qian* and *Kun* advance and retreat within seven, eight, nine, and six. The body is four, the function six; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass both body and function. Thus thirty-six, transformed by four, becomes four nines; transformed by six, six sixes. Twenty-four, transformed by four, becomes four sixes; transformed by six, six fours. As for twenty-eight and thirty-two, they transform only by four and cannot transform by six.\n\nFrom the perspective of function: four sixes make twenty-four, the extreme of yin. Advancing six makes thirty, the middle of yang; advancing another six makes thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Six sixes make thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Retreating six makes thirty, the middle of yin; retreating another six makes twenty-four, the extreme of yin. From the perspective of body: six fours make twenty-four, the extreme of yin. Advancing four makes twenty-eight, then another four makes thirty-two, then another four makes thirty-six, old yang. Nine fours make thirty-six, the extreme of yang. Retreating four makes thirty-two, then another four twenty-eight, then another four twenty-four, old yin. Only *Qian* and *Kun* can advance and retreat, uniquely converging within seven, eight, nine, and six—used as the two elders of yin and yang. The six children cannot transform by six, so their use is not discussed.\n\nYang arises within yin, advancing from six to nine; old yin arises within yang. Retreating from nine to six, the changes of the two elders never depart from the four images. Thus, adding four to nine, eight, seven, and six yields the body’s numbers of four. Further deducing function from within the body, we have thirty-six, thirty-two, twenty-eight, and twenty-four. The *Yi* has sixty-four hexagrams: sixty correspond to the six *Jia*, and four to the four seasons. The two elders and two youths each have their offices, yet yin can never precede yang. *Qian* is originally the number of six yangs, yet it can also incorporate half of *Kun* to become nine. Three threes make nine; nine nines, eighty-one. This is the number of old yang, beginning at three and culminating at nine. The numbers of old yin and the two youths are but nodes within it. Thus it is said: speaking of the body of one qi, it is called *Qian*, encompassing all.\n\nThe great *Yi* doubles its eighteen to divide the classic, totaling thirty-six. King Wen ordered it, Confucius aided it—revealing the utmost to humanity. Since the Han, none have been able to expound it. The *Jingshi* text doubles its two sixes to divide the epochs, totaling three hundred sixty. The great and small epochs, six advances and six retreats, manifest in years, months, days, and hours.\n\nZhang Guanwu said: The numerical method of twelve originates from the qi numbers of yin and yang, then divides. Three hundred eighty-four is the number of the body; three hundred sixty, the number of function. Ten uses seven, twelve uses eight—these are intersecting numbers. Yang gains six, yin contracts six—these are surplus numbers. One, three, five, seven, nine; two, four, six, eight, ten—these are the numbers of odd and even. Long numbers extend the small to the great, returning to *Qian*. Fractional numbers divide the great into the small, gestating into *Kun*. Further dividing one line of *Qian* descends into six hexagrams: *Dayou*, *Xiaoxu*, *Lü*, *Tongren*, and *Dun*—these are the images of *Qian*.\n\nMultiplying numbers: two multiplied by twelve always ends at two; three multiplied by three advances to thirty, always ending at six. Dividing numbers: divide one into two, two into four, four into sixteen. Subtracting numbers are diminishing numbers. Multiplying numbers are extending numbers. For example, yin multiplying yang, yang multiplying yin—three hundred sixty multiplied by three hundred sixty—yields one hundred nineteen thousand six hundred, as in one *yuan*.\n\nIt is also said: Hexagrams have a body derived from function, and function derived from body. The body derived from function begins with one yin and one yang, becoming two yins and two yangs, then four yins and four yangs. Four becomes eight, combining into twelve yins and twelve yangs. In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, the outer eight hexagrams descend from eight: eight yangs interspersed with eight yins, eight becoming sixteen.",

Four threes and two sixes: the four seasons each split into three, further dividing the two sixes. Twenty-four corresponds to the twelve qi of the months. Eight nodes: one node has three qi. Four seasons: one season has six qi.\n\nThe lines of the eight trigrams in Prior Heaven’s one palace each total forty-eight, divided among the four directions to correspond to the four phases.",

      "translated_text": "Sixteen yins interspersed with sixteen yangs, sixteen becoming thirty-two. Thirty-two yins interspersed with thirty-two yangs, thirty-two becoming sixty-four. One hundred ninety-two yangs with eighty yins, one hundred ninety-two yins with eighty yangs. Taken together, the left side of the inner palace has sixty-four yangs and thirty-two yins, while the right side likewise has sixty-four yins and thirty-two yangs. In the upper palace, left and right each have forty-eight yangs and forty-eight yins. From body to function: from sixty-four to thirty-two, thirty-two to sixteen, sixteen to eight, eight to four, four to two, two to one. The One is the Supreme Polarity. This is the division of the Supreme Polarity, the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams.\n\nMaster Shao said: The body of Heaven and Earth has the number four, its function is three, and what is not used is one. He also said: Heaven’s four transformations contain Earth’s four transformations. Heaven and Earth each have four trigrams; the eight are merely four. Heaven is round and takes function as its master, while its body is subsumed under Earth. Earth is square and takes body as its master, while its function follows Heaven. Heaven pares four down to three, taking three as its function. Earth splits one into four, taking four as its body. From *yin* to *xu*, three are used and one is not—this is the old yang of four nines. From *mao* to *shen*, half are used and half are not—this is the old yin of four sixes. Four times four makes sixteen positions. Forms have the four directions, *qi* has the four seasons, and Heaven has the Four Images. Their transformations become cold and heat, day and night; containing Earth’s Four Images, they transform into rain, wind, dew, and thunder. Heaven is sufficient to envelop Earth. Heaven’s three doubled makes six, and six arises from one. Including the root makes seven; excluding the root makes six. Thus yang always preserves one to govern advance, advancing to thirty-six. Earth’s two uses twelve, and twelve arises from four. Including the root makes sixteen; excluding the root makes twelve. Thus yin always obscures one to govern retreat, retreating twelve months to diminish twelve days.\n\nTherefore, the great ultimate of Heaven turns rightward from Earth, while the primordial *qi* of Earth moves leftward from Heaven. It is also said: Three is thirty, and one-one is two sixes. This speaks of the numerical reckoning of yin and yang *qi* in one year. One year has four seasons, one season has three months, and one month has three decades. Following Heaven’s function with the heavenly stems: five days make one *hou*, and three *hou* (fifteen days) make one *qi*. Following Earth’s function with the earthly branches: six days make one *fen*, and three *fen* (twelve hours) make one day. In the large, one year encompasses three hundred sixty days, divided from thirty days. In the small, one month encompasses three hundred sixty hours, accumulated from thirty *fen*. One day transforms into thirty, one *hui* has thirty *yun*, and one *shi* has thirty years. Thirty twelve-hour periods make one month, twelve thirty-day periods make one year, thirty twelve-month periods make one *shi*, twelve thirty-year periods make one *yun*, thirty twelve-*shi* periods make one *hui*, and twelve thirty-*yun* periods make one *yuan*.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven’s six transformations generate three hundred sixty—this is the number of its movement. One transformation generates six, two transformations generate twelve, three transformations generate eighteen, four transformations generate twenty-four, five transformations generate thirty, and six transformations generate thirty-six. Thereupon, advancing to three hundred sixty. The number of Heaven’s movement takes one as its root. Using one with six requires no reliance on Earth. One transformation is sixty, and six transformations are three hundred sixty—this is spoken in terms of Heaven and Earth. Five generates six: one month has five trigrams, and one trigram has six lines. Five multiplied by six—five sixes—makes thirty. Excluding the four cardinal trigrams, one year has sixty trigrams, and six sixes make three hundred sixty lines. One year completes sixty *jiazi* cycles, also six sixes making three hundred sixty days. One transformation generates six; subtract one to make five, and five takes one as its root. Two transformations generate twelve; subtract two to make ten, and ten takes two as its root. Extending to three, four, five, and six transformations, always subtract their three, four, five, or six to preserve the root, yielding the numbers fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, and thirty. Thus it is said: Five sixes generate thirty. Thirty trigrams correspond to Heaven’s six transformations, yielding one hundred eighty. In the *Prior Heaven Diagram*, left and right are alike, each having five transformations generating thirty-two yangs and thirty-two yins. Five and six alternate, odd and even pair, and thus five and six are the central numbers of Heaven and Earth. The movement of the four seasons goes nowhere without harmonizing with them.\n\nCounting trigrams with the twelve branches, one transformation occurs every six days. Counting *hou* with the ten stems, one transformation occurs every five days. Sixty transformations generate three hundred sixty. Three hundred sixty multiplied by three hundred sixty yields the number of one *yuan*: one hundred twenty-nine thousand six hundred.\n\nIt is also said: Earth’s four transformations generate thirty-six—this is the number of generating things. Four generates twelve, twelve generates twenty, twenty generates twenty-eight, twenty-eight generates thirty-six, and thereupon advancing to two hundred fifty-six. The number of Earth’s generation takes four as its root and uses two with ten. Two splits one into four, splits four into sixteen, splits sixteen into sixty-four, and splits sixty-four into two hundred fifty-six—these are Earth’s four transformations. Sixteen is Earth’s four. One transformation into four is Earth’s one. Four generates eight: one four generates two fours, and combining them makes three fours—twelve.",

      "translated_text": "A *hui* comprises thirty *yun*, totaling 46,656,000 *shi* and 1,399,680,000 *fen*, which amounts to 16,799,160,000 *miao*, corresponding to the *Lǚ* hexagram. A *yuan* comprises twelve *hui*, totaling 559,872,000 *shi* and 16,799,160,000 *fen*, which amounts to 201,553,920,000 *miao*, corresponding to the *Duì* hexagram. The number 129,600 constitutes a *yuan*: the years of a *yuan*, the months of a *hui*, the days of a *yun*, and the *chen* of a *shi* all share this number of 129,600.\n\nThe sixty *jiazi* cycle circulates within the Prior Heaven’s square and circular diagrams. The circular diagram represents Heaven; removing the four cardinal hexagrams and their twenty-four lines corresponds to 360 days, moving through the ten Celestial Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. The ten Stems correspond to Heaven’s ten days, while the twelve Branches correspond to Earth’s twelve months and twelve *shi*. Thus, five days make a *hou*, ten days make a *jia*, fifteen days make a *qi*, and thirty days make a month. *Jia* and *wu* transform through yang, *ji* and *gui* through yin—five transformations. *Wu* and *hai* transform through yin, *zi* and *si* through yang—six transformations. In a year, the *jiazi* cycle completes six-tenths; in a month, three *jia* cycles with five-sixths of another; in a year, thirty-six *jia* cycles yielding 360 movements, revolving through Heaven’s five to generate seventy-two. In a month, two *zi* with half of another, five-sixths of six; in a year, three sets of ten *zi*, also totaling 360 movements, revolving through Earth’s six to likewise complete seventy-two. On the left of the diagram, fifteen *zi*. Each *zi* undergoes two transformations, totaling thirty transformations—1, 3, 6, 180. The right is the same, also totaling 360. Thirty *fen* make a *shi*; 360 make the *miao* of a *shi*; 4,300 accumulate into a day. Again, taking months as years, two and a half days and thirty *shi* make a month. The thirty *fen* of a *shi*—each *fen* as a day, every *fen* with twelve *miao*, each *miao* as a *shi*. Condensing years into months, months into days, days into *shi*. Even 129,600 years are but the accumulation of the *fen* and *miao* of a single *shi*. Divided minutely, it extends to 16,799,616,000 *miao* and no further. Refined ever further, it enables the investigation of principles and the exhaustion of affairs. Ascending into the azure heavens, descending into the yellow springs, broadly containing primordial *qi*, minutely entering the boundless.\n\nMaster Yang Xiong once deduced this. Now, rotating the circular diagram reveals the expansion and contraction of emperors, kings, and hegemons; the order and chaos of past and present; the movements of the four seasons and myriad transformations; the revolutions of the sun, moon, and stars. *Qian* and *Kun* govern it, thereby illuminating Heaven’s numbers.\n\nThe square diagram represents Earth, structured by four. Counting by fours, reaching four nines, it turns to sixteen matters for clarification, extending to 256 positions for differentiation. Heaven’s voice initiates above as the six *lü* resonate; Earth’s tone responds below as the six *lü* answer. Creatures that run, fly, and plants all correspond to these numbers. *Kan* and *Li* govern its movements, with four yin and four yang generating beings on Earth.\n\nThe Prior Heaven’s study begins from the center of the diagram. The great pivot of creation is all the marvel of spontaneity. Master Shao should have contemplated this with profound insight, never departing from it even for a day. Master Cheng said: *\"The Book of Changes* reckons in reverse. To foresee the unmanifest as if it were past, what need is there for divination?\" Yet numbers are principle. Principle has its inevitabilities, such as the three or five generations. Rarely does it err—numbers cannot escape principle. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, abandoning principle to speak of numbers has long led to apocrypha. Only Master Kangjie spoke of numbers to reach principle, aligning with the movements of Heaven and Earth. Effortlessly compliant, vast in its return. As he said: \"Before the diagram, there was *zi*; after *wu*, there is no change.\" If numbers are thus, principle is also thus. I say: exhaust principle, fulfill nature, to reach destiny. Principle is primary, yet numbers are within it. Though the Master did not speak of destiny, he said, \"If the River does not yield the Diagram, I am done.\" If numbers are unclear, principle is also obscured. Thus, Master Shao said: \"Learning that does not connect Heaven and humanity cannot be called learning.\" The noble person should attain its utmost.\n\nI say: the numbers of the world arise from principle; violating principle leads to mere calculation. Master Zhu said: \"Though Master Kangjie’s methods differ, in essence, they are the hexagrams drawn by Fuxi.\" The *Records of the Historian* state: \"Those who embody the compositions of Heaven and Earth reach their culmination in *The Book of Changes*.\" The odd lines of Heaven and even lines of Earth, the yang nine and yin six, the 4,096 hexagrams’ changes, the 11,520 counting rods—what more can be added? Thus, the sun, moon, stars, water, fire, earth, and stone exhaust the substance and function of Heaven and Earth. Cold and heat, day and night, rain, wind, dew, and thunder exhaust the transformations of Heaven and Earth. Nature, emotions, forms, bodies, creatures that run, fly, and plants exhaust the responses of the myriad things. The *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, *shi*, years, months, days, and *chen* exhaust the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. Emperors, kings, hegemons, *The Book of Changes*, *The Book of Songs*, *The Book of Documents*, and *The Spring and Autumn Annals* exhaust the achievements of sages and worthies. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, there has been only one such master. The essentials of numerical study:\n\nHeaven as one, Earth as two.\nHeaven’s odd: one-one; Earth’s even: two-two.\nHeaven has no ten; Earth has no one.\nOne, three, five—three heavens, thus *Qian* uses nine.\nTwo, four—two earths, thus *Kun* uses six.\nOne is the body of Heaven’s roundness.",

Earth’s number is thirty, combined as sixty, corresponding to the hexagram numbers. Heaven’s six operational numbers belong to yang; Earth’s eight structural numbers belong to yin.\n\nHeaven’s six changes yield six times six, thirty-six periods. Earth’s four changes yield four times four, sixteen positions. Heaven’s number six, each line thirty-six: halved, three times six makes eighteen changes. Five times six makes thirty days; six times six makes three hundred sixty. Earth’s number two, each line twenty-four: halved, two times six makes four times forty-eight lines; six times seventy-two seasonal markers; sixty times six likewise yields three hundred sixty.\n\nHeaven stores its operations in six; Earth manifests its power in eight. Heaven has six changes, with three yielding six. From six to thirty-six, these are Heaven’s six changes. Earth has four directions, with two yielding four. From four to two hundred fifty-six, these are Earth’s six changes. Heaven encompasses Earth, thus employing six changes: one change sixty, six changes three hundred sixty. Earth does not encompass Heaven, thus employing four changes: one change four, two changes sixteen, three changes sixty-four, four changes two hundred fifty-six.\n\nSix as the operational number belongs to yang; eight as the structural number belongs to yin. Six times six constitutes the operational use of the thirty-six hexagrams. Eight times eight constitutes the structural body of the sixty-four hexagrams.

Earth’s number thirty, combined as sixty, advances to one hundred twenty.\n\n*Qian* totals two hundred fifty-two, the operational number of the thirty-six hexagrams. *Kun* totals one hundred eight, the intersecting number of the twenty-four hexagrams. From the fifty tallying numbers, remove one, dispersing it into forty-nine for use. Within use lies structure: beyond the sixty hexagrams, four remain—four as the body of the sixty hexagrams. Within structure lies use: Heaven seven, Earth eight. Heaven employs seven; Earth’s body is eight.\n\nHexagrams with six times six belong to use, attributed to yang lines, transforming into eight. Eight belongs to structure, attributed to yin hexagrams, opening things through *Qian*’s operation. In the eighth month, things close through *Kun*’s operation, dividing into three parts.\n\nHeaven nine, Earth ten.

Three times twelve makes six, likewise yielding *Qian*’s two hundred sixteen.\n\nHeaven culminates in nine, Earth exhausts in ten. Ninety marks the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth. The numbers of the eight trigrams total thirty-six. One and eight, two and seven, three and six, four and five—all intersecting numbers are nine. To speak of ten is merely nine’s counterpart.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless, cannot be fully grasped by the mind alone. Only when one attains stillness and emptiness does the spirit naturally abide within. The *Taiji* generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes give rise to the Four Images; the Four Images produce the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams govern the myriad things, each in its proper place.\n\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth unite to form one thousand two hundred. The numbers of the Three Powers combine to make one hundred eighty. The numbers of the Four Seasons total seventy-two. The numbers of the Five Phases multiply to thirty-six. The numbers of the Six Directions yield one hundred twenty. The numbers of the Seven Regulators amount to eighty-four. The numbers of the Eight Winds sum to sixty. The numbers of the Nine Palaces reach one hundred forty-four.\n\nThree times three makes nine; nine times nine yields eighty-one. Three times four makes twelve; twelve times twelve yields one hundred forty-four. Three times five makes fifteen; fifteen times fifteen yields two hundred twenty-five.

Three times nine makes twenty-seven; twenty-seven times twenty-seven yields seven hundred twenty-nine.\n\nThe Great Yang ascends, the Great Yin descends. Yang advances, yin retreats. The *Taiji* divides into the Three Primordials. The Three Primordials generate the Three Heavens. The Three Heavens give rise to the Three Qi. The Three Qi produce the Three Essences.

      "translated_text": "The Spirits and Gods\n\nThe *Book of Changes* (*Yijing*) reveals the mysteries of Heaven, Earth, spirits, and gods. It begins with the phrase on the obscure and the manifest, life and death, then proceeds to discuss spirits and gods. After Confucius’ commentary on the *Changes*, from Yan [Hui], Zeng [zi], Zisi, and Mencius down to the several masters of the Zhou [Dunyi], Cheng [brothers], Zhang [Zai], and Zhu [Xi], the teachings diverged. The two traditions of Śākya and Laozi departed from the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, presenting an entirely different view. Buddhism uses the fear of spirits to guide people, urging them to take refuge so as not to fall into the cycle of rebirth. Daoism employs transmission to entice people, promising that through cultivation one may attain longevity. Descending further into世俗俗 practices, people carve statues from wood and earth to enshrine them, or invoke spirits through the shamanic cries of mediums. Is this all there is? Who can truly fathom the traces of the creative transformations? Alas, how lamentable!\n\nMaster Cai Xie said: Spirits and gods are the wondrous workings within Heaven and Earth. One must take them as a subject for contemplation and enter into reflection to grasp them. The *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"Looking up, one observes the patterns of Heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of Earth. Thus one knows the causes of the obscure and the manifest. Tracing things to their origins and returning to their ends, one knows the explanations of life and death. Essence and qi become things; wandering souls undergo transformation. Thus one knows the conditions and forms of spirits and gods.\" This is to apply the principles of yin and yang from the *Changes* to observation.\n\nThe patterns of Heaven pertain to yang and thus are manifest; the principles of Earth pertain to yin and thus are obscure. The sun, moon, and stars are manifest, yet in the vast and distant reaches, there is also obscurity. Descending into the Yellow Springs, all is obscure, yet in the sprouting and flourishing of life, there is also manifestation. Coming forth from the origin pertains to yang, hence it is called life. Returning to the end pertains to yin, hence it is called death. Human life is measured by a span of a hundred years. If one preserves and nurtures properly, even in old age, the yang may remain robust. If not—even in one’s prime, one may decline. Thus, when yang is dominant, yang recedes and yin diminishes; the vitality of life overflows, the bent straightens, the withered flourishes, and in the radiance of wind and moon, all is harmonious and abundant—here one may perceive the conditions of the spirit. When yin is dominant, yin advances and yang recedes; the vitality of life contracts, the straight bends, the flourishing withers, and like a waning moon or a chilling wind, when the yang qi is exhausted, death ensues—here one may perceive the conditions of the ghost.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, yang is solely concerned with generation. If there were no yin to bring about death, there would be life without end, and the creative transformations would nearly cease. Therefore, by examining the obscure and the manifest, one may know life and death. By examining life and death, one may know spirits and gods. One qi assumes myriad forms; one breath spans past and present. Comprehending the Dao of day and night, one may understand the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth, whose inexhaustible source lies herein. Is this not the vital qi of the Great Ultimate? Alas! How subtle it is!",

      "translated_text": "Someone asked: *\"The* Book of Changes *speaks of Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, and the four seasons, yet concludes with ghosts and spirits—this refers to the contraction and expansion of the two qi. Master Zhou speaks of Heaven, Earth, and humanity, yet concludes with life and death—this refers to the gathering and dispersal of the single qi within humans. But can Heaven and Earth not be spoken of in terms of life and death?\"*\n\nI reply: *\"Heaven and Earth are their forms; life and death are their qi. Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to live. The yang soul belongs to Heaven; the yin corporeal soul belongs to Earth. In death, the soul’s qi returns to Heaven, while the body and corporeal soul descend to Earth, reverting to the Great Origin as before. Thus, by examining human life and death, one may encompass the day and night of Heaven and Earth. Within this are the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the transformations of the four seasons, the contraction and expansion of ghosts and spirits—who can fathom their bounds?\"*\n\nMaster Cheng said: *\"The* Book of Changes *speaks of ghosts and spirits as the workings of creation. Tracing spring to its origin, winter must follow; taking winter as the end, spring must return. Life and death are of the same kind. To know the Way of life is to know the Way of death; to know the Way of serving humans is to know the Way of serving spirits. Life and death, humans and ghosts—one yet two, two yet one.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Ghosts and spirits are inherently difficult to comprehend. One should focus on the essentials: how much principle governs human life! From the moment we receive the nature of the Five Constants, there are the bonds of father and child, the righteousness of ruler and minister. Each of these principles of life must be understood, and then the principles of death will also be known. In serving one’s ruler or parents, one fulfills what is proper. Having exhausted the Way of sincerity and reverence, one may then turn this mind to serving ghosts and spirits—thus, in sacrifice, the departed are present; in worship, the spirits are present. This requires grasping the principle without deficiency. At the time of death, when the principle of life is exhausted, one rests in death without regret.\"*\n\nThus, Master Zhang said: *\"Preserve what is right in life; in death, find peace.\"*\n\nThe Confucians hold that principle is neither born nor destroyed, while the Buddhists claim that consciousness is neither born nor destroyed. The sages do not speak of what comes after death—what more need be said? They only teach that between birth and death, one must attend to life with utmost care. The Six Classics record the deeds of the sages and worthies in full, yet say nothing of the threshold of life and death, for they regard it as an ordinary matter. Only the *Records* and the *Analects of Lu* provide detailed accounts of Master Zeng’s final illness, merely to instruct scholars in preserving the body and upholding principle. How could they emulate the Buddhists, who, ignorant of principle, regard sitting death or standing transcendence as marvels?\n\nHu Mingshong said: *\"Humans are creatures of life, yet the Buddha speaks only of death. Human affairs are visible, yet the Buddha speaks only of the hidden. Master Hengqu’s view that ‘when form dissolves, it returns to the Origin’ means that humans receive this qi to live, and in death, return to the Great Origin. Thus, when a person dies, their qi disperses. The qi within the Great Origin then emerges anew to give life to others.\"*\n\nHe also said: *\"Heaven and Earth are the substance; ghosts and spirits are their function. Heaven and Earth are spoken of in their entirety, while ghosts and spirits refer to their dynamic transformations, permeating above and below. Rain, wind, dew, thunder, and plants—all are understood by analogy. Spring and summer are spirit; autumn and winter are ghost. Day is spirit; night is ghost. Before noon is spirit; after noon is ghost. Inhalation is spirit; exhalation is ghost. Life is spirit; death is ghost. Speaking is spirit; silence is ghost. Extension is spirit; contraction is ghost. Qi coming forth is spirit; its return is ghost. The sun is spirit; the moon is ghost. After the third day is spirit; after the sixteenth day is ghost. Heaven’s creation is spirit; Earth’s transformation is ghost. Plants sprouting is spirit; withering is ghost. Human youth and vigor are spirit; decline and old age are ghost. Wind and thunder stirring are spirit; their gathering is ghost. The onset of wind, rain, thunder, and lightning is spirit; their cessation is ghost.\"*\n\nMaster Zhang said: *\"The Great Void cannot be without qi. Qi cannot but gather to form the myriad things, nor can the myriad things but disperse back into the Great Void. This cycle of exit and entry is inevitable. As qi, when dispersed, enters the formless, it perfectly attains our body; when gathered, it takes shape without losing its constancy. Gathered, it is our body; dispersed, it is still our body. Knowing that life and death do not perish—one may then speak of nature!\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"Nature is simply principle and cannot be spoken of in terms of gathering and dispersal. What gathers to give life and disperses in death is merely qi. The so-called spirit, soul, consciousness, and awareness are all the workings of qi. Thus, when gathered, they exist; when dispersed, they vanish. But principle is never absent due to gathering or dispersal. Where there is principle, there is qi. If qi gathers here, principle also resides here—it cannot be compared to ice and foam. Ghosts and spirits are the spirit, soul, consciousness, and corporeal soul—qi, not nature. Thus, the rites of sacrifice operate through resonance by kind. If nature were involved, how could there be such resonance? Yet the qi that has already dispersed is gone without a trace. That which is rooted in principle and daily renewed remains vast and inexhaustible. Therefore, the sages’ sacrifices—setting up ancestral tablets, employing impersonators, offering mugwort and millet, libations and purifications—whether seeking in the yin or the yang, spare no effort, stopping only at the utmost. They say, ‘Perhaps they will partake.’ The profound sincerity, compassion, subtlety, and elusive intent therein defy expression—such things cannot be sought with the shallow knowledge and rigid views of the common world.\"*",

      "translated_text": "How can it be said that upon receiving one’s formed body, this nature thereby becomes one’s own possession, enduring even after death without annihilation, standing alone as a distinct entity hidden in stillness, awaiting the sacrifices and prayers of others to be summoned forth and partake of offerings? If this were so, then the boundaries of its scope and the place of its abode would indeed be definable. Yet from the beginning of creation until now, the accumulated dead would have piled up without end, leaving no space to contain them. How could such a principle exist?\n\nMoreover, the creative transformations of Heaven and Earth resemble a great furnace. The ceaseless generation of beings knows no rest—this is the true principle of reality, unconcerned with annihilation. Now to fix one’s gaze upon a vast, empty stillness and instead regard the consciousness of the deceased as the true principle of reality—is this not a grave error?\n\nWhat the sages and worthies mean by \"returning to wholeness\" and \"resting in death\" is simply that one has not lost one’s proper place. Having received the principle from Heaven, one may die without shame. It is not that there exists some tangible entity to be preserved and returned, thereby ensuring that one’s indestructible and imperishable self may repose in tranquil solitude. Whether one dies young or lives long, one remains unwavering, cultivating the self and awaiting one’s end—this is a state of being without contrivance. It cannot be equated with the heterodox view that makes much of life and death, warning of impermanence’s swift approach, and thus misleads scholars.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Ghosts and spirits are but the workings of creation. Heaven is honored, Earth is lowly—thus the positions of Qian and Kun are established. They are stirred by thunder and nourished by wind and rain.\" This explains that in the manifest there are rites and music, and in the hidden there are ghosts and spirits. Master Zhu said this refers to the contrast between the hidden and the manifest. To claim that the hidden contains ghosts and spirits while the manifest does not is to misconstrue the subject, failing to understand what ghosts and spirits truly are and becoming mired in doctrines of rebirth and karma.\n\nHow could one not see that within rites and music there are ghosts and spirits, and within ghosts and spirits there are rites and music? The two are one and the same; one must only distinguish their boundaries and differentiate them. Heaven and Earth take their positions, distinguished by the act of treading—this is ritual. Yet within the interaction of the two qi, there is never an absence of music. The stirring of wind and thunder is music. Yet when the wind subsides and the rain ceases, when thunder stills and lightning fades, each follows its proper order—within this, there is never an absence of ritual.\n\nRitual restrains human emotions, for qi contracts. Harmony is prized, and what contracts will again expand. Music stirs human emotions, for qi is spirit-like. Yet its movements and rests are measured, and what expands will again contract. The hidden and the manifest communicate; contraction and expansion alternate, and there is nowhere they do not commune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe Buddhists, however, regard death and killing as settled matters, claiming that the manifest becomes human and the hidden becomes ghost. How could they know that the noble person’s vigilance in solitude makes even the hidden corners of a room feel as though the divine is present? Ritual binds the sinews and body, while music nurtures the nature and emotions. The rites and music within oneself are the very presence of ghosts and spirits above.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Book of Changes* states: \"The essence of qi refers to the seventh and eighth hexagrams, speaking of the spirits of wood and fire that generate beings in the southeast. The wandering soul refers to the ninth and sixth hexagrams, speaking of the spirits of metal and water that end beings in the northwest.\" The old yin and old yang, when contracted, become ghosts. The young yin and young yang, when expanded, become spirits. The southeast is the manifest; the northwest is the hidden. This does not mean that ghosts and spirits exist only in the darkness of Heaven and Earth while the manifest is devoid of them.\n\nIn later ages, rites decayed and music was abandoned; human hearts became frivolous and deceitful. Having lost their order and harmony, their communion with ghosts and spirits no longer followed the proper way. If one does not revere them, they become distant—how could there be any principle of resonance and response?\n\nMaster Zhang said: \"Ghosts and spirits are the innate capacities of the two qi.\" Master Zhu said: \"Master Cheng’s explanation of ghosts and spirits as the pathways of creation is fine, but it remains too vague. Master Zhang’s account is clearer, revealing the presence of yin and yang, contraction and expansion, and their ceaseless alternation.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion, the terms \"yin\" and \"yang\" alone cannot fully express ghosts and spirits. The numinous aspect of yin is called ghost; the numinous aspect of yang is called spirit. Their innate capacity is precisely their numinosity, enabling them to contract, expand, and transform.\n\nMaster Zhang further said: \"At the beginning of a thing’s life, qi arrives daily and flourishes. Once the thing reaches full growth, qi daily returns and disperses. The arrival is called spirit, for it expands. The return is called ghost, for it withdraws.\" He also said: \"At the beginning of a person’s life, the qi of Heaven and Earth continually accumulates, gradually growing and expanding within the body. Upon reaching its peak, it gradually declines and dissipates. Yet all this occurs naturally, not by any external agency—hence it is called innate capacity.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Yin is the shadow of yang; ghosts are the shadow of humans; the moon is the shadow of the sun; emotions are the shadow of nature. Yang, humans, the sun, and nature are all the masters of yin, ghosts, the moon, and emotions. Once the master is established, the shadow naturally follows. At the winter solstice, the first yang is born, corresponding to the birth of the first yin at the summer solstice. From the winter solstice to the sixth month, the six yangs are complete; from the summer solstice to the twelfth month, the six yins are complete. One yang in the heavens corresponds to one yin on earth; one thing in the water corresponds to one thing on the shore—this is true of all things. Yet yang is always the master, and yin is always the shadow, like the male and female. A day has twelve hours, and a year has twelve months. At dawn, the moon begins to brighten; at the full moon, its light is complete. At the first and last quarters, it begins to wane, and by the end of the month, it is dark. From this, one may perceive the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nWithin nature lies the principle of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, and externally, it casts the shadow of compassion, shame, deference, and a sense of right and wrong. Every form that emerges casts a shadow. The human soul becomes spirit, and within it, the shadow of the spirit becomes the ghost’s corporeal soul.\"",

      "translated_text": "When the sun reaches its darkest point, the moon loses its light; when a person grows old, the spirit becomes weary and restless.\n\nIt is also said: Before thoughts and considerations arise, ghosts and spirits do not yet know them. If not by me, then by whom? The practice of the Dao should reach a point where even ghosts and spirits cannot perceive it. Good and evil take form in speech and manifest in action, at which point others begin to know them. Yet as soon as they sprout in the heart and emerge in thought, ghosts and spirits already know them. *The Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"The noble person is cautious and reverent in what is unseen, fearful in what is unheard.\" This is indeed the noble person’s discipline of vigilance in solitude, ensuring no shame even in the hidden corners of the house. Yet when it speaks of thoughts not yet arisen, it refers to the time before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are expressed—ghosts and spirits cannot glimpse that boundary. Thus it is said: If not by me, then by whom?\n\nIn the depths of obscurity and the subtlest of matters, though not yet manifest, the incipient movement has already stirred. Though known only to oneself and unseen by others, ghosts and spirits already know it. Therefore, the noble person is vigilant in solitude, not waiting for words or deeds to take shape. Ever mindful of ghosts and spirits hovering above, they dare not harbor even the slightest reckless thought within. Once, a man played the zither and saw a mantis hunting a cicada; those who heard it perceived a killing intent in the music. The killing intent was in the heart, yet others heard it in the zither—how much more so for ghosts and spirits? In this, the noble person cultivates only reverence to keep the inner self upright. They listen to the soundless, see the formless, and thus do not wait for signs in countenance or utterance before exerting effort.\n\nShao [Yong] also said: The spirit of the human heart is the spirit of Heaven and Earth. To deceive one’s own heart is to deceive Heaven itself. How can one not be vigilant? Heaven and Earth are empty and luminous, needing neither ears nor eyes to see and hear all.\n\nIt is further said: When qi and form flourish, the hun and po flourish; when qi and form decline, the hun and po also decline. The hun transforms with qi, while the po ascends with form. Thus, as long as form exists, the po remains; when form dissolves, the po scatters. When the qi of the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, heart, spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys is whole, it is called a person. The numinous spirit of the heart is called *shen*; the numinous spirit of the gallbladder is called *po*; the numinous spirit of the spleen is called *hun*; the numinous essence of the kidneys is called *jing*. The spirit of the heart manifests in the eyes as sight; the essence of the kidneys manifests in the ears as hearing; the hun of the spleen manifests in the nose as smell; the po of the gallbladder manifests in the mouth as speech. Only when these eight are complete is one called a person. This explains the inner workings of the human form, refining the hun and po to gain understanding.\n\nThe human body possesses the numinous principle of Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits, yet fails to reflect inwardly. Instead, it spends its days chasing externals, reaching white-haired old age and death without self-awareness—how lamentable! Metal and wood mark the beginning and end of generation; in humans, they correspond to spirit, essence, hun, and po. Essence forms the body, and the yin po clings to it; qi forms the hun, and the yang shen depends on it. These four cannot be separated, which is why the hun and po wax and wane with qi and form. When form changes, the yang hun departs; when the po dissolves, the yin form decays. Thus, the ancient kings regarded dismemberment and incineration as the ultimate punishment, and for the dead, they divined burial sites to ensure peaceful rest.\n\nThe kidneys belong to the north, where Heaven’s One Water resides, hence they store essence. Essence first transforms into po, and the po is the source of essence—it is the servant of essence and qi, accompanying their ingress and egress. Water generates wood, and wood is its child, so the gallbladder stores po. The heart belongs to the south, where the Great Void’s fire governs clarity, storing shen. The yang hun is born of shen, and the hun is the attendant of shen and qi, following their ingress and egress. Fire generates earth, and earth is its child, so the spleen stores hun.\n\nIn the human body, spirit and essence are the masters, while hun and po are their agents. When essence flourishes, the po flourishes. Only utmost sincerity can generate essence, and utmost essence can generate spirit. Sincerity is what Heaven’s One produces without falsity. If one can focus on the One and not dissipate their essence, they attain sincerity like a spirit. The heart can govern qi but cannot master the One. If it dissipates essence, the heart becomes enslaved by form. How then is one different from beasts, not merely dying without a name?\n\nHuman life arises from spirit, essence, hun, and po—the functions of nature—and from blood, qi, water, and grain—the functions of form. Only through mutual nourishment of inner and outer can spirit and essence grow strong, and hun and po flourish. Nature is received from Heaven and must have a repository. The heart stores shen, the kidneys store essence, the spleen stores hun, and the gallbladder stores po. The heart governs these repositories. Thus, when it manifests in voice, scent, speech, and sight without violating principle, it is called numinous. Form is endowed by Earth and must have a storehouse. The lungs are the storehouse for transmitting qi; the liver is the storehouse for transmitting blood; the stomach is the storehouse for transforming water and grain, while the intestines and bladder separate the clear and turbid. Thus it is said: \"Of the natures endowed by Heaven and Earth, humans are the most noble\"—how could it be like the heterodox teachings on hun and po?\n\nOnce, a student of immortality told me: \"Begin with the dragon, tiger, quail, and tortoise.\" He also said: \"Begin with the heart and kidneys.\" And again: \"Seek within the Five Agents of the Five Viscera,\" yet he never revealed the ultimate secret. Later, I obtained the essential method, and the starting point was quite simple. It is simply a matter of focused effort—yet today, people know but do not practice.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] and Cai Xishan explored this their whole lives and deeply understood it. They once said: Daoists favor shortcuts, using terms like lead, mercury, and the Mysterious Female, exchanging names to confound people. In truth, it is merely essence and qi. Qu Yuan’s *Chu Ci* contains the theory of \"illuminating the po.\"",

From this, one may perceive the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nWithin nature lies the principle of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, and externally, it casts the shadow of compassion, shame, deference, and a sense of right and wrong. Every form that emerges casts a shadow. The human soul becomes spirit, and within it, the shadow of the spirit becomes the ghost’s corporeal soul.\"",

      "translated_text": "Speaking in terms of essence and spirit, \"illuminating\" (荧) means \"to nourish\" (营), the gathering of yin numinosity that manifests as luminosity. If the *po* does not receive the *hun*, then the *hun* cannot bear the *po*, and the person dies. Moreover, the *hun* is active while the *po* is tranquil; the *hun* is fire and two, while the *po* is water and one. To \"bear and nourish the *po*\" is to apply the *hun* to the *po*, to use movement to guard stillness, to use fire to press upon water, and to use two to guard one. It is like a person mounting a chariot and being carried upon it—then the *hun* is at peace and the *po* is clear and bright. Fire does not scorch, and water does not overflow; this is the essential method for long life and enduring vision. Yet this still does not explain the *how* of it.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] has a poem that says:\n*\"Thieves unlock the secret of life’s mystery,\nStealing past the gate of birth and death.\"*\nAnd again:\n*\"Yet fear defying Heaven’s Way,\nCan stolen life ever be at peace?\"*\nThus, he too knew but did not practice.\n\nMaster Zhu said: *Essence* and *qi* are terms used in relation to things; *hun* and *po* are terms used in relation to humans; *ghosts* and *spirits* are terms used when speaking of them apart from humans. While alive, they are called *essence* and *qi*; after death, they are called *hun* and *po*; in things, they are called *ghosts* and *spirits*. *Qi* is substantial; *hun* and *po* are half-substantial, half-insubstantial; *ghosts* and *spirits* are mostly insubstantial with only a little substance.\n\nHe also said: When the two—essence and *qi*—unite, *hun* and *po* gather to form a person. When the wandering *hun* departs alone, the yang has already dispersed, and the yin has nowhere to return, thus becoming transformation. Zichan said: \"At the beginning of human life, the first transformation is called *po*; once the *po* is born, the yang is called *hun*.\" The Tang scholar Kong said: \"When a person is born, the first transformation is into form. The numinosity of form is called *po*. Within the *po* there is naturally yang *qi*. The spirit of *qi* is called *ling*—these are the names for *hun*, *po*, spirit, and numinosity. At birth, the movement of ears, eyes, heart, perception, hands, and feet is the numinosity of the *po*. As essence and spirit, nature and perception gradually develop awareness, this is the spirit of *qi*.\"\n\nMoreover, the *hun* is yang and belongs to fire; the *po* is yin and belongs to water. \"Heavenly One generates water\"—yin and yang first interact. Once the *po* is born, warmth gives rise to the *hun*; the *po* comes first, then the *hun*. The *hun* is always the master, the trunk. *The Huainanzi* says: \"Heavenly *qi* is the *hun*, the yang spirit; earthly *qi* is the *po*, the yin spirit.\" Yue Qi said: \"The clarity and sharpness of the heart are called *hun* and *po*.\" The *po* belongs to the physical form; the *hun* belongs to the spirit. *Essence* is again the *po*; the *po* is the spirit of essence. *Spirit* is again the *hun*; the *hun* is the spirit of *qi*.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: The *hun* is spirit-like and the *po* is numinous; the *hun* is yang and the *po* is yin; the *hun* is active and the *po* is tranquil. While alive, the *hun* is borne by the *po*, and the *po* restrains the *hun*. After death, the *hun* scatters and returns to Heaven, while the *po* sinks and returns to Earth. That which moves and acts is the *hun*; that which does not move or act is the *po*. When the *po* is strong, the ears and eyes are keen, and memory is sharp. When the elderly grow dim-sighted, hard of hearing, and forgetful, it is because the *po* has weakened.\n\nIf the *hun* is fiery and the *po* is cool, and one can use the *hun* to guard the *po*, then the *hun* has something to guard and becomes tranquil, while the *po* is warmed by the *hun* and gains vitality. The heat of the *hun* generates coolness; the coolness of the *po* generates warmth. Only when the two do not separate can yang not scorch and yin not stagnate, achieving harmony. Otherwise, the more the *hun* moves, the more the *po* becomes still; the hotter the *hun*, the cooler the *po*. When the two fail to harmonize, death follows.\n\nHe also said: While a person lives, *hun* and *po* interact; after death, they separate. The *po* has a form within, like a crystal’s ancestor, and thus manifests as the clarity of ears and eyes. The dark halo of the moon is the *po*; its light is the *hun*. It is like incense: the sap that exudes when burned is the *po*; the fragrant smoke that rises afterward is the *hun*. The *hun* is the flame of the *po*; the *po* is the root of the *hun*. Fire is the *hun*; the mirror is the *po*. A lamp has flame—when an object approaches, it burns. A mirror reflects, yet remains within. Fire and the sun are external manifestations; metal and water are internal manifestations. Fire and the sun are the *hun*; metal and water are the *po*. The light of a person’s eyes is the *po*; the ears are likewise. Why is it the *po*? Because the ability to hear is the *po*. The nose knows scents; the tongue knows tastes—all are the same. Yet one cannot take the ability to recognize words as the *po*, for recognition belongs to the heart. Whether sweet, salty, or sour, it must pass through the tongue.\n\nYin governs storage and reception, so the *po* can remember. Yang governs movement within, so the *hun* can manifest outwardly. These two are never truly separate. When essence gathers, the *po* gathers; when *qi* gathers, the *hun* gathers—this is the basis of human and other beings. When essence is exhausted and the *po* descends, *qi* scatters and the *hun* wanders, and there is no more awareness.\n\nSpeaking of the human body, though *qi* belongs to yang, the physical form of the *po* already belongs to yin—within life is already the principle of death. Though transformation belongs to yang, the *hun* ascends while the physical form of the *po* descends, thus possessing yin and yang. Even now, the living are half spirit and half ghost. Before death, spirit is master; after death, ghost is master.\n\nIn the *Liyun*, Zai Wo said: \"I have heard the names *ghosts* and *spirits*, but do not know what they mean.\" The Master said: \"*Qi* is the fullness of spirit; *po* is the fullness of ghost. The teaching on ghosts and spirits is the utmost.\" The *Jiaotesheng* says: \"The *hun*-*qi* returns to Heaven because the *hun* originally attaches to *qi*; when a person dies, *qi* must rise.\" It also says: \"The physical *po* descends to Earth because the *po* originally belongs to form; when a person dies, form returns to the soil.\"\n\nThe sages, in managing the affairs of the living and the dead, established sacrificial rites. Since existence and nonexistence differ, they created distinct names. They changed the name of the living spirit to *hun* and the name of the living ghost to *po*, combining *hun* and *po* to name them *ghosts and spirits*, honoring them in ritual. Thus it is said: \"Illuminating the Mandate of ghosts and spirits to instruct the common people.\"",

The fullness of *ghost* refers to the clarity of ears and eyes, the ability to see and hear, and the vigor of essence and blood.\n\nSomeone asked about the theory of life and death. Master Xie said: \"It is the exhaustion of *qi*.\" The questioner asked: \"Are there ghosts and spirits?\" He replied: \"I once asked Master Mingdao: 'If I tell you there are none, how will you believe it? But if I tell you there are, you must go and seek them out.' That is the answer.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Master Shangcai’s explanation of ghosts and spirits is excellent. He said: 'What is fitting draws people to emulate it, not to die for it. What is fitting—such as offering sacrifices to ancestors and parents—requires utmost sincerity to move and reach them. One must not treat it as a matter of life and death. What is unfitting makes people distance themselves; one must not treat it as a living concern, nor ignore it entirely, lest it vanish.'\"\n\nWhen asked about the purpose of sacrificial offerings, he said: \"It is their intention—fasting for three days, abstaining for five, seeking in the realms of yin and yang, the four directions, and above and below. The aim is to gather one’s own spirit, thereby reaching the ancestral temple and summoning the spirits.\" Yet though this is so, to insist on their existence is wrong, and to deny it is equally wrong. Within this lies a subtle principle, in the realm of \"as if present, as if absent.\" Only by resolving this can one proceed correctly. He said: \"It is not a matter of confusion—if you will it to be, it is; if you will it not to be, it is not. Only then do you grasp that ghosts and spirits, though unseen in the void, manifest everywhere, for they are the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\nHe also said: \"When yin and yang unite, they become *spirit*; when form and *qi* part, there are *ghosts*. To know this is wisdom; to serve them is benevolence. Fasting and abstinence are merely means to gather one’s own spirit. The ancients used a *shi* (representative) to invite the union of yin and yang, drawing their *qi* to that person—this was not done in vain. When sacrificial sincerity and reverence are complete, *qi* naturally gathers. Thus, in ancient sacrifices, the spirits were summoned and came.\"\n\nWhen asked, \"If ancestors are already dead, how do they come?\" he replied: \"As Master Shangcai said: 'The spirit of ancestors is the same as our own spirit.' The response in sacrifice may be sought in yin or in yang, each according to its kind. Seek, and all will come. It is not that some entity lingers in the void, awaiting the arrival of descendants. Rather, the presiding sacrificer, being of the same *qi* in continuous flow, already harbors that *qi*. By exhausting sincerity and reverence, one moves and reaches them.\"\n\nSomeone asked about distant and collateral relatives. He said: \"They all flow from the same source, originally without interruption. Though a person dies and *hun* and *po* scatter—*po* being more settled—one must summon the *hun* to return, so that it may reunite with the *po*. The sages taught descendants to perform regular sacrifices to gather the *qi* of their ancestors. Though it may seem scattered in the moment, its root remains here. When sincerity and reverence are complete, that *qi* is drawn and gathered here. The descendant’s body is here, so the ancestor’s *qi* is here as well. There is a bloodline that runs through, which is why spirits do not respond to those outside their kind, and people do not sacrifice to those outside their clan—because their *qi* is not connected.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The contraction and expansion, coming and going of ghosts and spirits are merely *qi*. Human *qi* constantly interacts with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, though people do not perceive it. When the human heart stirs, it reaches the *qi*, which then resonates with this contraction and expansion. As the earlier scholars said: 'Where there is principle, there is the *qi* of yin and yang.' This *qi* permeates even the finest hair or thread. When this heart stirs, that *qi* responds. Where the numinous light of ghosts and spirits shines, it is radiant; where their *qi* rises, it is like steam; where it stirs one’s spirit, the wind is solemn and mournful. Thus, the *Sacrificial Rites* speak of seeking in yang to repay *qi*—*qi* is *spirit*. Hence, the establishment of ancestral temples, the burning of offerings at the grave, the lighting of torches, and the use of fragrant herbs to make the *qi* ascend—all belong to the yang category. There is also seeking in yin to repay the *po*—*po* is *ghost*. Thus, offerings of millet, sacrificial meats, liver, lungs, heads, and hearts, along with *yu* and *kuai* (sacrificial wines), are poured onto the earth to seek them. The smoke rising from split wood is the *qi* of moisture—this is *po*. Uniting *hun* and *po* as one is how one seeks the *qi* of ghosts and spirits in sacrifice.\"\n\nIn my humble opinion: Breathing is the *qi* of our body; clouds and rain are the *qi* of mountains and rivers. Rising above is the *qi* of numinous light and brightness. When it moves here, it responds there. From the first generation of humanity, the ancestors of *qi*-transformation, it has been passed down to this day. Descendants, ancestors, Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers—all are connected by a single *qi*. The earlier scholars said: \"Though the *hun*-*qi* of the dead scatters, setting up a spirit tablet to preside over it requires gathering some of that *qi* here.\" In ancient times, from the moment of death, they would summon the *hun*, restore the *po*, and establish multiple spirit tablets—always seeking to maintain a connection to that spirit. The ancients used the blood of sacrificial animals to anoint tortoise shells, for when the shell lost its numinosity, they would use this living *qi* to reconnect it.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"The great mountains and rivers that bring forth clouds and rain do so simply because *qi* steams upward.\"",
      "overlap_context": "ngs to form; when a person dies, form returns to the soil.\"\n\nThe sages, in managing the affairs of the living and the dead, established sacrificial rites. Since existence and nonexistence differ, they created distinct names. They changed the name of the living spirit to *hun* and the name of the living ghost to *po*, combining *hun* and *po* to name them *ghosts and spirits*, honoring them in ritual. Thus it is said: \"Illuminating the Mandate of ghosts and spirits to instruct the common people.\"",

      "translated_text": "Qi is spirit. People today do not understand this principle; at the first sign of flood or drought, they rush to temples to pray, unaware of where rain and dew originate. The great mountains and rivers can summon clouds and bring rain—why not inquire of them? How can one seek this from wooden or clay effigies?\n\nSomeone asked Master Zhu: \"When people pray to Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, is it that my *qi* moves and their *qi* responds? When descendants sacrifice to ancestors, is it that my *qi* moves and their *qi* responds?\" Without the numinous *qi* of spirits, it constantly expands and contracts without cease. The *qi* of humans and ghosts, however, dissipates without remainder—though the speed of dissipation varies. Yet if one’s own *qi* connects with theirs, then through utmost sincerity and reverence, as Master Shangcai said, \"Where there is intent, there is presence.\"\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"By its functional operation, it is called *gui*; by its wondrous operation, it is called *shen*.\" He also said: \"Ghosts and spirits lie at the edge of creation and transformation.\" The heat of the sun and cold of the moon, the brightness of day and darkness of night, the growth of spring and the withering of autumn, the flourishing of summer and the storage of winter—all that generates and completes the myriad things are the functional operations of ghosts and spirits, manifest and visible. He further said: \"The wondrous operation that cannot be seen—perceiving without form, hearing without sound, embodying things yet leaving no trace. The Dao is neither existent nor nonexistent; it is both present and absent. Suddenly, in an instant, it transforms and changes. In the emptiness of space, there is thunder and wind, rain and lightning. On the branches of trees, flowers and leaves suddenly bloom, wither, or open. These are the impartial and upright ghosts and spirits of Heaven and Earth, phenomena people commonly witness without finding strange.\"\n\nYet when ghostly fires appear at night, bricks fly in broad daylight, beams strike chests, or whispers cling to ears—with a thousand monstrous forms too numerous to record—these are what the *Great Change* calls \"a cartload of ghosts.\" The *Spring and Autumn Annals* speaks of stones speaking in Jin, of bronze tripods casting omens, of a hundred anomalies subdued by Han swords, and spirits howling when tested. The ghostly fan of Minister Fan, the serpentine form of Kong Daofu—should these be believed or not?\n\nIt is said: These are all born of the chaotic intermingling of a single *qi*, tainted by the dark and perverse, and thus deemed strange. They are not the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth. For ghosts and spirits arise from yin and yang just as humans arise in the world. As there are many kinds of people, so too are there many kinds of things, and many kinds of ghosts and spirits. Throughout Heaven and Earth, they densely intermingle, assuming forms according to their natures, each fully endowed—one cannot say they do not exist.\n\nThose born of Heaven become the sun, moon, and stars, yet may transform into comets, eclipses, or hail. Those born of Earth become mountains, rivers, grasses, and trees, yet may take the forms of mountain spirits, sea deities, *chimei*, or *wangliang*. Those born of water, fire, earth, or stone may bring cataclysmic floods, raging wildfires, dust storms, or collapsing cliffs. As for humans, the upright become sages, worthies, and noble gentlemen; the aberrant become fools, the dull, the stupid, the violent, and the tyrannical. In greater extremes, if one does not observe the turbid Yellow River or the clear Wei, they become the chaotic monstrosities of the cosmos. In death, some become wise and upright spirits, receiving sacrifices for a hundred generations; others, harboring grievances and suffering, coalesce into ox ghosts and serpent deities. Their transformations are beyond enumeration—can one truly say they do not exist? It is merely a matter of whether they are upright or not.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"Winter’s cold and summer’s heat are the norm of principle. Yet if summer grows cold or winter hot, can one say this principle does not exist?\" This is why the sages spoke of constancy and did not discuss the strange.\n\nMaster Cheng further said: \"The case of Boyou becoming a *li* is a different principle.\" Master Zhu said: \"It is not the common principle of life and death.\" He also said: \"When one’s *qi* is not exhausted but death is forced upon them, they naturally become a *li*.\" Zichan established an heir for him, giving him a place to return. These words exhaust principle to its utmost precision—one may say he truly understood the conditions of ghosts and spirits.\n\nIn the *Zuozhuan*, when the people of Zheng were startled, saying, \"Boyou has arrived!\" they all fled, not knowing where to go. Some dreamed of Boyou in armor, saying, \"I will kill Dai, and then kill Duan.\" The people grew even more fearful. Zichan established Gongsun Xie to appease him, and the disturbances ceased.",

      "translated_text": "The Master said: \"When ghosts and spirits have a place to return, they do not become *li*. I provided him a place to return.\"\n\nJin’s Zhao Jing asked: \"Does Boyou still become a ghost?\" The Master replied: \"When one consumes abundant essence from things, their *hun* and *po* grow strong, and thus their spirit may attain the clarity of divine illumination. Even common men and women who die violently—if their *hun* and *po* still cling to others—they become malevolent *li*. How much more so for Liangxiao, a descendant of our former lord Duke Mu, whose use of things was vast, whose absorption of essence was great, and whose clan was large and well-supported? That he died violently and became a ghost is only fitting.\"\n\nTang’s Master Kong said: \"He held high office, wielded power, and enjoyed lavish sustenance, so his use of things was abundant and his *hun* and *po* strong.\" Someone asked: \"Former scholars spoke of ghosts and spirits as both existent and nonexistent. Yet what the *Zuozhuan* records cannot be called nonexistent.\" Master Zhu said: \"Humans receive the *qi* of Heaven and Earth, which must eventually disperse—only the timing varies. Where their spirit reaches, it moves Heaven above. In ancient times, Jing Ke admired Yan Dan’s righteousness, and a white rainbow pierced the sun. Wei Xiansheng devised the Changping strategy for Qin, and Venus devoured the Pleiades. When Han executed the filial widow, there was a great drought for three years. When Jin killed an innocent commander, blood flowed backward up the pillars. Other examples, such as Duke Jing of Qi dreaming of the ghost of Wuqiu or the Wang clan of Han exonerating the injustice at Xueque Pavilion, are all recorded by historians and cannot be dismissed. I shall categorize these accounts so that later discussions of ghosts and spirits do not lose their bearings and drift without guidance. This is also the meaning of ‘revering and keeping them at a distance.’\"\n\nThe explanation is as follows: The two *qi* of yin and yang disperse between the two realms. Everywhere the eye falls, ghosts and spirits are present. If we do not distinguish them by their domains, all becomes one indistinguishable mass, the realms of the hidden and the manifest grow confused, and the human Way cannot be established. Thus, in Heaven, they are the sun, moon, stars, wind, rain, frost, dew, the four seasons, and cold and heat—clearly, ghosts and spirits move within them. This is what the *Book of Documents* calls \"serving the Six Ancestors,\" and should be regarded as one category. On Earth, they are the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, the mountain lords and river sovereigns who summon clouds and rain to aid the work of transformation—these cannot be called nonexistent. This is what the *Military Triumph* refers to as \"passing through famous mountains and great rivers,\" and should be regarded as another category. Those whose merit and virtue remain among the people and are recorded in the sacrificial canon—such as Gou Long and Hou Ji for their achievements, or the Master for his virtue, who as sages and worthies endure through ten thousand generations without fading—should be regarded as yet another category. When a person dies, they are called a ghost, their *qi* already dispersed. Yet where the descendants’ spirit gathers, the ancestors come to partake. This is what the *Analects of Lu* means by: \"Sacrifice as if they are present; sacrifice to the spirits as if the spirits are present.\" This is not only true for the scholar sacrificing to his ancestors. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all have their proper ranks and measures, which must not be transgressed—this should be regarded as another category. Below this, there are mountain goblins, earth spirits, water monsters, and tree demons; where there is no ghost, there is still debate, and strange phenomena arise. The turnip was punished for falsehood, yet it appeared in person—these cannot be disbelieved. Some hang from the tip of a writing brush or cling to a winnowing basket; some generate thunder or summon cranes. Between Heaven and Earth, such wandering *hun* and stray ghosts exist, capable of deluding people. They cannot be called nonexistent, but they are not of the proper kind—this should be regarded as another category.\n\nWhen categories are precisely distinguished, principles become perfectly clear. As Gu Yong said: \"Understand the nature of Heaven and Earth, and you will not be deluded by the supernatural.\" The ancients said: \"Govern the world with the Dao, and its ghosts will not be divine.\" This is the Way of cultivating the self. The human body is the meeting place of ghosts and spirits. Within this mere shell, inside and out, there is nothing that is not the *qi* of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. When this heart stirs, it responds. Thus it is said: \"What fills Heaven and Earth constitutes my body; what leads Heaven and Earth constitutes my nature.\" When my heart is upright, those impartial and upright ghosts and spirits naturally respond. If there is any impropriety, those wandering *hun* and perverse *qi* will entangle and cannot be resolved.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"It is like a fish in water: the water outside is the same as the water inside its belly. The water in a mandarin fish’s belly is the same as the water in a carp’s belly.\" Though this saying is small, it can illustrate great truths. Since later ages, the theories of licentious and excessive sacrifices have arisen, and the virtue of the heart’s ghosts and spirits has been neglected. Alas, how lamentable!\n\n*Tian Yuan Fa Wei*, Scroll Seventeen, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "The Transformations\n\nHeaven and Earth transform, and yin and yang arise; yin and yang transform, and the myriad beings arise; the myriad beings transform, and sages and worthies arise. In ancient times, those who became scholars achieved success in three years and underwent one transformation in ten. They began as scholars and ended as sages. All people transform their qi-endowed nature to return to the Heaven-ordained nature. It is also said: \"Reverence alone suffices.\" Reverence leads to unity, unity to sincerity, sincerity to manifestation, manifestation to clarity, clarity to movement, movement to change, and change to transformation. Only the utmost sincerity in the world can bring about transformation.\n\nSomeone asked: \"Why is *Transformation* placed at the end of the twenty-fifth scroll?\" The answer: Since the Supreme Ultimate first divided, Heaven and Earth have been like a great furnace, with the myriad beings born within it. From non-being to being, all emerge through refinement from within. From being to non-being, all gradually dissolve and return within. From the sixty-four thousand eight hundred years of the precelestial era’s inception to the postcelestial era from Yu’s *jiazi* to the *jiawu* year of the Yuan dynasty—over three thousand five hundred and ten years—how many transformations and changes have occurred among people? How many sages and worthies have appeared across the ages? Mountains and valleys shift, the cosmos renews, and not a single person or thing remains constant. Only through the preservation of classical texts can these be examined and verified.\n\nCold transforms into warmth, warmth into heat, heat into coolness, and coolness back into cold—within these transformations lies further change. Thus, spring transforms into summer, summer into autumn, and autumn into winter. The alternation of cold and heat continues without end. People and things are likewise bound within the transformations of Heaven and Earth and cannot escape them. Rotten pillars give rise to sesame and *fuling*; fish transform into dragons, the hidden taking flight. Sparrows transform into clams, the flying descending. Hawks transform into turtledoves, the vicious becoming virtuous. Turtledoves transform into hawks, the virtuous turning vicious. Wildcats transform into leopards, leopards into tigers—small things can indeed transform into great ones. Yet when a sage neglects reflection and acts recklessly, even greatness may diminish—how lamentable! Judging by yin and yang, nothing is immutable; how much more so for humans, who are the most spiritually endowed of all beings?\n\nThe blind man’s son can become a Yao; the man from the roadside can become a Yu; the seemingly foolish man from the humble alley can become a sage—these are those adept at transformation. Those who fail to transform well include Dan Zhu and Shang Jun, who were unworthy of their fathers; Xia Gui and Shang Xin, who bore no resemblance to their ancestors; Xia Hui, whose virtuous younger brother could not transform his elder brother; and Huan Chi and Sima Niu, whose elder brothers refused to emulate their younger siblings. Humans, as the most spiritually endowed of Heaven and Earth’s creations, yet fail to refine their qi-endowed nature to return to goodness, thereby betraying the transformative power of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHow, then, can one excel at transformation? Only by cultivating utmost reverence to attain the realm of sincerity can one stand without shame as a human and align with Heaven and Earth. Scholars aspire to worthiness, the worthy to sageliness, and sages to Heaven. Without reverence, how can this be achieved? This chapter on *Transformation* concludes the scrolls for this reason.\n\nMaster Cheng Shuzhi said: \"*The Book of Changes* is about change, adapting to the times to follow the Dao.\" Master Zhu said: \"Change is the gradual process of transformation; transformation is the completion of change.\" He also said: \"Yin changes into yang, and yang transforms into yin.\" When change and transformation are discussed in contrast, change is growth, and transformation is decline. Yet when considered as a whole, all is transformation. At the turning point, it becomes change. Change is the shift from yin to yang, from non-being to being, from the subtle to the manifest, from night to day. The soft changes into the hard, and cold into warmth. From sprouts growing into branches and leaves, suddenly flourishing and taking on new forms—this is change. Transformation is the shift from yang to yin, from being to non-being, from flourishing to decline, from day to night. The hard transforms into the soft, and warmth into cold. Whatever has form and substance gradually diminishes until it vanishes—this is transformation.\n\nHe further said: \"Yin changing into yang is progress, naturally growing vigorously. Yang transforming into yin is retreat, naturally fading away without a trace. Yang, having reached its peak, turns back and retreats. Yin, having retreated to its limit, rises and advances. Thus, transformation is the image of advance and retreat. Yang transforming into yin and yin changing into yang—this is transformation. What enables transformation is the Dao. The Dao is the inherent mystery; transformation is the mechanism it rides. Thus, yin changes and yang transforms, and the Dao is present in all. It is present in both, hence unfathomable. As it is said: 'One who knows the Dao of transformation knows the workings of the spirit.' Therefore, the spirit has no fixed direction, and *The Book of Changes* has no fixed form. The spirit has no fixed direction—it may reside in yin or yang. Just as it is spring, it may already be summer; just as it is autumn, it may already be winter. *The Book of Changes* has no fixed form—it may be yin or yang. Just as it is spring, it may also be summer; just as it is autumn, it may also be winter. They alternate and interchange, unbound by any fixed form.\"\n\nMaster Yichuan said: \"Change is like a thing in the process of changing but not yet transformed; once transformed, there is no trace of the old.\" *The Essential Principles of Mount He* states: \"Returning to the original form is called transformation. Gradual alteration is called change. Even if the old form suddenly changes, it is still called transformation.\" This is the ancient view. Master Zhu’s explanation is more precise. He said: \"In transformation,裁 (cutting) is preserved in change.\" *Cai* means to cut or sever. He also said: \"To extend and enact it is preserved in *tong* (permeation).\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Permeation (*tong*) is the permeation of change. Having already determined through *cai* (cutting), one extends and enacts it. For example, a year is cut into four seasons, a season into three months, a day into twelve hours—this is change. Yin and yang alternate; without *cai* (cutting), how could there be fixed forms? Endless coming and going is called *tong* (permeation). To handle change appropriately is *tong*. When there is *tong*, there is no exhaustion.\n\nTransformation (*hua*) arises naturally, *cai* is human intervention, and change (*bian*) alters things. Transformation is a gradual, day-by-day process. For instance, the weather gradually cools, and upon reaching the Beginning of Autumn, it is decisively cut off—what follows is autumn, which is change. The twelve hours from *zi* to *chou* to *yin* and *mao* all transform imperceptibly, but after *hai*, the *zi* hour is sharply demarcated as belonging to the next day—this is what is meant by change. Again, like the movement of stars, which never pause for even a moment: if one were to record their positions hour by hour or from dusk to dawn, the daily discrepancy of one degree would make it impossible to track. Thus, the Dipper is only demarcated month by month. Whether it is the *hun* (dusk) or *dan* (dawn) culmination of a given day, it is determined by this monthly *cai*. When transformation reaches the end of a month, that is change.\n\nAnother example: a year of three hundred and sixty days progresses day by day, and when it reaches completion, this is transformation. From spring to summer, summer to autumn, autumn to winter—when the sage cuts this progression into four seasons, this is change.\n\nIt is said: 'Permeate its changes, so the people do not grow weary.' One must find someone who can permeate change. If left to transform on its own, how could it be managed? As in 'The dragon soars too high and meets with regret'—this is a failure of *tong*. To handle it without regret is *tong*. To permeate change is simply to ensure constant, unobstructed flow.\n\nFor example, a person’s circumstances—wealth or poverty, peace or peril, barbarism or hardship—these are changes. To act rightly in wealth, rightly in poverty, rightly in barbarism or hardship, so that there is no situation in which one does not find contentment—this is *tong*. To cut at the point of transformation is change; to handle it well is *tong*.\n\nThe changes of all things in the world arise solely from the two forces of yin and yang. When yin reaches its limit, it turns to yang; when yang reaches its limit, it turns to yin—one can only follow them. When the sage reaches the utmost point of goodness, there is still another principle at work. Before the stage of 'treading on frost, solid ice will come,' as soon as yin begins to stir within yang, one employs a hundred methods to restrain it—this is indeed so. But if yang were to persist unchecked, how could the myriad things come to fruition? It is simply the natural course of things. The rise and fall of a state’s fortune also follows this urgency.\n\nWhen Yao had reigned for seventy years, his vigor naturally declined, so he sought out Shun and entrusted the realm to him, thus renewing the cycle. If he had continued without pause until his death, even the legacies of Wen and Wu would have declined. The urgency of the Cheng and Kang eras gave way to complacency in maintaining prosperity, and when it reached its limit, King Zhao’s reign could not be revived. After Emperor Xuan of Han, the dynasty steadily declined until Guangwu arose—yet after one or two generations, it could not be sustained, and the imperial line repeatedly faltered. Emperor Guangwu of Liu was like what Kangjie called 'spring in autumn'—a matter of timing.\n\nIt is also said: When observing people within the workings of heaven’s mandate, there is not a moment of rest. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—there is no pause. It is like a great cartwheel, hurtling forward in decline. The sage simply follows its course, observing how the principle operates, applying this principle here and that principle there.\n\nThe six lines of *Qian* are all yang, each taking its image in sequence. They describe the sage’s dwelling in different positions and stages. Whether hidden, emerging, cautious, leaping, soaring, or at its peak, each is appropriate to its place. 'Hidden' means remaining below, not yet in use—like level ground where even if there is water, it is but a shallow pool, while the deep abyss cannot be fathomed. 'Leaping' means moving without yet taking flight—still grounded, but no longer walking. With a single bound, it rises, feet leaving the earth. Once it leaps, it ascends to the heavens, no longer bound to the abyss, yet still unfathomable. Below, it departs from walking; above, it nears flight. Neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor among men—unlike the second nine, which is secure. Here, one cannot advance or retreat; it is not up to oneself, but subject to the timing of heaven.\n\nIn the sage’s terms, this is like Shun’s trials, King Wen’s two-thirds dominion, or Tang and Wu’s victories at Mingtiao and Muye. At the top nine, it is the position of Yi and Zhou, yet it is already difficult. It seems that people within heaven’s mandate have not a moment’s respite. One may leap into action, possessing virtue but no position. If the effort is incomplete, one does not lose the status of a hidden dragon. Fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—there is not a moment’s pause. Like the wheel of a great cart, hurtling forward in urgency, the sage simply follows its course. As it is said: 'Preceding heaven, heaven does not oppose it; following heaven, it accords with the timing'—how could there be the slightest trace of self-interest?\n\nIt is also said: *Qian* is the utmost vigor under heaven. Nowadays, people only judge its vigor by whether it appears vigorous, not waiting for events to unfold before seeing it. Master Zhu said: I once noted that when Liu Yuancheng met others, he would sit for a long time without much conversation. Though urged to stay, he would not engage in discussion. When asked about this, Yuancheng said: 'A person who sits for a long time without shifting is surely noble.' Thus, observing how a person sits can reveal their nobility, longevity, or short lifespan. Later, when he met Master Caotang, he remarked that Yuancheng loved to talk.\"",

Yuancheng died in the same period as Chen Liaoweng; one wonders, had the two masters lived through the Jingkang era, how would they have been employed?\n\nI say: In the early Shaoxing era, Ma Yongqing of Weiyang composed a *yulu*, recording that he had personally seen Yuancheng at around sixty-three or sixty-four, his bearing majestic and his spirit robust, his speech grand and his manner forthright. Whether in cold or heat, dawn or dusk, he would always meet guests in full attire. Even while engaged in conversation, his body remained upright, shoulders squared and back straight, his posture unmoving—even his hands and feet never shifted. A truly formidable man. Ma noted that when he recorded these words, twenty-six years had already passed. Thus, in the fifth year of Shaoxing, only fifteen years had elapsed since Yuancheng’s death.\n\nYuancheng initially studied under Master Sima Wengong, never uttering a single careless word. Once he grasped this principle, he upheld it steadfastly throughout his life. His virtue was perfected, his conduct revered, and all within the realm looked up to him. After crossing the ridge, he abstained from wine and desire, enduring harsh climates and poor water and soil without falling ill. His vitality and longevity were beyond that of ordinary men.\n\nMaster Shao’s *Xiantian Fangtu* and *Yuantu* depict the four images intersecting to form sixteen configurations. The eight trigrams interact to produce sixty-four, and from this wondrous interplay of resonance, all beings and things arise.\n\nWhen the qi of heaven and earth commingle, they give birth to beings and things. Observing their convergence reveals the extent of qi’s reach, from which one may discern the origin of their kind. When heavenly qi descends to earth, in humans it produces males, and in creatures, males. When earthly qi ascends to heaven, in humans it produces females, and in creatures, females. From the union of male and female, yang and yin, arise endless generations of transforming beings.\n\nOnce beings and things are born, their qi follows the ascending and descending, the interplay of heaven and earth’s qi. Humans receive the central qi of heaven and earth, and thus respond to the qi of all four directions. Creatures receive the partial qi of heaven and earth, each responding to what they encounter. Therefore, by observing the convergence of heaven and earth’s qi, one may understand the origins of beings and things. By observing the resonance of heaven and earth’s qi, one may understand their mutual generation.\n\nHeaven and earth are forms; their convergence is through *Qian* and *Kun*. When *Qian* and *Kun* are not in use, their convergence is through *Kan* and *Li*. Who but one who understands the Dao could recognize this?\n\nThe qi of a single day spans twelve hours; the qi of a month, thirty days; the qi of a year, twelve months. Wherever qi reaches, all things receive it according to their endowment, and by this endowment, they receive the qi of heaven and earth, becoming the root of endless generation.\n\nHumans receive the central qi of heaven and earth, thus moving in harmony with them, gathering the qi of all things within their bodies. This is why humans are nobler than heaven and earth and more spiritually endowed than all creatures. One who can grasp the Dao of heaven and earth and wield its mechanism is, in effect, heaven and earth themselves.\n\nIt is also said: Those who receive the central qi of heaven and earth become human, possessing the qi of all four directions. Thus, humans are the noblest of heaven and earth and the most spiritually endowed of all things. The human head is round, mirroring heaven; the feet are square, treading earth. Facing south and turning north, left to the east and right to the west, ears sharp and eyes bright, hands raised and feet planted—all align with the proper order. Dwelling at the center of heaven and earth, they occupy the position of *zi* and *wu*. The five human relationships—ruler and minister, father and son—and the five constant virtues—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom—are rooted in the heart and manifest externally.\n\nThose who receive qi that is clear, upright, and unobstructed become sages and worthies. Those who receive qi that is turbid, biased, and blocked become fools and the unworthy. Even those near the east tend toward benevolence and softness, while those near the west tend toward righteousness and hardness—such differences in endowment are inevitable. The Yi and Di barbarians, though human, are fierce and lack propriety and righteousness because they inhabit particularly biased lands, and thus their endowment is also biased. This is the work of qi, not of inherent nature.\n\nHumans stand upright, while birds and beasts lie horizontally, and plants grow sideways. Those that lie horizontally receive qi that is particularly biased. Thus, their heads face west, their backs to heaven, and their feet to earth—yet even within this bias, traces of benevolence and righteousness remain. Those that receive eastern qi embody benevolence; those that receive western qi, righteousness—thus occupying the positions of *mao* and *you*. Though birds lie horizontally, their heads are raised, slightly distinguishing them from beasts. Those that receive eastern qi embody benevolence; those that receive western qi, righteousness.\n\nCreatures with scales, shells, fur, or wings represent qi gradually entering the earth. Those that grow sideways receive the qi of the earth. Those that receive northwestern qi are hard; those that receive southeastern qi are soft. All kinds under heaven are encompassed thus.\n\nThe dragon receives the true east; the tiger, the true west. Hence, the east has the Azure Dragon, and the west, the White Tiger. The *Shuowen* states: The *lin* is the benevolent beast of the east, and the *qingyu* is the benevolent beast of the west. Generally, those that receive eastern qi have horns; those that receive western qi have fangs. Horns signify constant benevolence. Those that fall short are also gentle and docile, like cattle and sheep. Those that exceed are harsh and predatory, like jackals, wolves, dogs, and pigs.\n\nWestern beasts all move at night, while eastern beasts are dazzled by night. Only the dragon defies this pattern, for it is divine. Birds lie horizontally but raise their heads, their qi rising from the earth and gradually nearing heaven—thus they raise their heads and can fly. Those of the east and west ascend from below: their heads are short, their tails long, their feathers patterned. When about to fly, they must first soar upward. Those of the southwest descend from above: their heads are long, their tails short, their feathers dark and plain. When about to fly, they first plummet downward.",

Though urged to stay, he would not engage in discussion. When asked about this, Yuancheng said: 'A person who sits for a long time without shifting is surely noble.' Thus, observing how a person sits can reveal their nobility, longevity, or short lifespan. Later, when he met Master Caotang, he remarked that Yuancheng loved to talk.\"",

      "translated_text": "Within these creatures, benevolence and righteousness reside as well. Among those that ascend, the smaller are like chicks, flying close to the ground. The greater are like *luan* and phoenixes, soaring straight to heaven. Among those that descend, the smaller are like wagtails and cranes, flying near the celestial pole. Ducks and teals fly low to the earth, even entering water. In the southeast, birds are dazzled by night; in the northwest, they fly by night. From the *xu* hour to the *you* hour, they gradually enter the earth; from the *yin* hour to the *mao* hour, they gradually emerge from it.\n\nThus, in the west, creatures are like beetles and butterflies—often trapped, for their qi gradually sinks. In the east, creatures are scaled and feathered—often flourishing, for their qi gradually rises. Hence, creatures like tortoises and toads excel at concealment and stillness, while fish and snakes excel at transformation. The interplay of yin and yang, the rise and fall of qi, bring this about.\n\nPlants draw the qi of the earth, so they all grow downward, the opposite of humans. This reversal of qi—whether counterflow or compliant—admits no alternative. Those that grow in the east are supple: they wither in autumn and flourish in spring and summer. Those that grow in the west are hardy: they wither in spring and flourish in autumn and winter. Branches and leaves turn toward yin, their leaves never leaving the earth, so beasts lodge there and feed on their foliage. Trees reach toward heaven, so birds perch there and feed on their fruit. Such is the pattern.\n\nThe three directions of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* produce no life; all other directions do. Precisely because they produce nothing, heaven and earth generate themselves. This is why heaven and earth endure and life never ceases. The winter of the year, the dark and new moons, the night of the day—these are the Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nZhang Guanwu said: A person’s lifespan of a hundred years—if reckoned by the long count of yin, one year adds one year. If reckoned by the division of yang, one year subtracts one year. Heaven begins with the odd numbers one, three, five, seven, and nine. From *zi* to *si*, from six to nine, from few to many, yang grows and yin wanes, its qi rising from below. Yang arises from below, as yang within yin. This is what is meant by yang first dividing to establish the great limit. When yang divides, it becomes empty—emptiness is yin. When yang reaches its peak, yin is born.\n\nEarth continues with the even numbers two, four, six, eight, and ten. From *wu* to *hai*, from nine to six, from many to few, yin grows and yang wanes, its qi descending from above. Yin arises from above, as yin within yang. This is yin growing to fulfill its finer count. When yin grows, it becomes full—fullness is yang. When yin reaches its peak, yang is born.\n\nThat yang first establishes the great limit is like a person’s lifespan of a hundred years, which has a fixed number. Yin comes to diminish yang, eroding its already fixed count. In terms of form and number, yin seems to add a year each year. In terms of division, yang truly subtracts a year each year. Thus it is said: When yang comes, life begins; when yang departs, death follows. It is not that yang departs—it is that yang is consumed by yin, exhausting its allotted number.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Speech must have order. Without order in speech, nothing can be accomplished. In the *Yijing*, *Gen*’s six in the fifth place says, “Restraining the cheeks.” The cheeks are the jaws and the carriage of speech. To restrain the cheeks is to speak without recklessness, with order—then others will readily listen and act, and regret can be avoided.\n\nHan-era Jia Yi had literary talent and a grand bearing, but his mind was narrow. When he undertook matters, he could not contain himself, bursting out with everything at once. He was restless and impatient, losing the sequence of his words. No wonder he met with failure. When Dou and Guan advised the emperor, they were modest and deferential, yet in the end, they accomplished nothing. Men like Han Xin, Deng Yu, and Zhuge Liang spoke with order, so their rulers readily listened, and they carried out their ways throughout their lives without altering their principles. How could this merely avoid regret? Their principles had a fixed pattern.\n\nSomeone asked: In *Xian*, the top six is the cheeks; in *Gen*, the six in the fifth place is the cheeks—why? The answer: In *Xian*, the top of *Dui* is the mouth; in *Gen*, the nine in the third place is the heart. Thus, the fifth yin line represents the cheeks.\n\nMaster Shao said: What makes humans more spiritually endowed than the myriad things is that their eyes can take in the colors of all things, their ears the sounds, their noses the scents, and their mouths the flavors. These—sounds, colors, scents, and flavors—are the substance of the myriad things. Eyes, ears, noses, and mouths are the functions of humans. When substance and function interact, the Dao of humans and things is complete.\n\nAll things under heaven possess principle, nature, and destiny. Only by exhaustively investigating them can they be used. If the eyes, ears, noses, and mouths of the world become one’s own, then the eyes see all, the ears hear all, the mouth speaks all, and the nose comprehends all. In this way, one takes the heart of the world as one’s own heart. The heart then plans all, and one can observe the ten thousand hearts with a single heart, the ten thousand bodies with a single body, the ten thousand things with a single thing, the ten thousand ages with a single age. One does not observe with the eyes but with the heart; not with the heart but with principle. What thing under heaven lies beyond this principle?\n\nThus it is said: In the tranquil observation of the myriad things, all are self-possessed. And again: Observing the myriad things from the perspective of heaven and earth, the myriad things remain the myriad things. Observing heaven and earth from the perspective of the Supreme Ultimate, heaven and earth are also things. If one can fully realize the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate, one can encompass heaven and earth, shape the myriad things, and hold creation in one’s grasp. How could the thousand thousand things be mere trifles, or the thousand thousand people mere common folk?\n\nHe also said: When the world is about to be well-ordered, people value conduct and righteousness. When the world is about to descend into chaos, people value words and profit. Valuing conduct fosters sincerity and solidity; valuing words fosters deceit and cunning. Valuing righteousness fosters modesty and deference; valuing profit fosters plunder and contention. Thus, the Three Kings valued conduct and entered into righteousness, while the Five Hegemons valued words and entered into profit. Even the likes of Boyi were surpassed—how could one bear to speak of it?",

      "translated_text": "In the Three Dynasties’ eras of order, there was no governance that did not take the regulation of human relationships as its Way. In the Three Dynasties’ eras of chaos, there was no disorder that did not arise from the disruption of human relationships. To abandon human relationships is to become a barbarian.\n\nSince ancient times, no dynasty has slaughtered as many people as the Qin. Yet the slaughter of many does not always require the blade. It is said that when the people of the world have no path to survival, how much worse is it to kill them in great numbers with the blade?\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"The human mind and the mind of the Dao, refined into one and held to the center\"—these sixteen characters alone determine the right and wrong of the self, the peace or peril of the world, and the order or chaos of the realm. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and their transmission to Confucius and Mencius embodied this. The long-lived rulers of the Three Dynasties established their hearts upon this and governed their states by it.\n\nAfter the passing of Master Meng, this learning was no longer transmitted, and the pursuit of profit and advantage took its place. From the Han and Tang onward, for fifteen hundred years, governance has been but a patchwork of makeshift repairs. Though some eras have known brief stability, the learning transmitted by the Two Emperors, Three Kings, Zhou, and Confucius has never once been fully realized in the world.\n\nScholars of the age, if they possess even a modicum of talent, refuse to humble their hearts and devote themselves to the work of the Confucian school or the practice of sagely learning. They seek only the abundance of their catch, unashamed by the impropriety of their gains, and mock those Confucians who adhere to rules, standards, and measures. This is why true learning has faded, and the world’s decline has grown ever steeper.\n\nHe also said: The difference between the noble person and the petty person, between rising and descending, lies in the slightest divergence at the outset of their intentions. Those who follow the heavenly principle ascend; they advance ever upward, day by day. Those who follow human desire descend; they sink ever lower, day by day. The petty person, ever descending, falls into deeper ruin with each passing day, dragged down by human desire as one drowning in water.\n\nIn the beginning, the division between rising and falling may seem slight, but over time, the gap widens immeasurably. Though one may possess wisdom and strength, even these cannot save or sustain them.\n\nThe ancients, recounting Confucius’ words, said: \"Those who know from birth are the highest; those who know through learning come next; those who learn through hardship come after. Those who suffer hardship yet do not learn—such people are the lowest.\"\n\nHe also said: \"Those above the level of the average person may be spoken to of higher things.\" Only the supremely wise and the utterly foolish cannot be changed.\n\nBan Gu said: Since the creation of written records, we may know of the early people. The classics and their commentaries speak of the emperors before Tang and Yu, who bore titles and regalia, though their ministers cannot be named. The various masters, however, have much to say of them. Their purpose was to make virtue manifest, expose evil, and admonish later generations, so their words have been preserved and transmitted.\n\nExplanations of the classics’ meanings are called *zhuan* (traditions). It is said: \"If one associates with Yao, Shun, Yu, Hou Ji, or Yi for goodness, they will act accordingly; if one associates with the likes of Gonggong, Huan Dou, or others who seek evil, they will be punished. Those who can be led to goodness but not to evil are called the supremely wise. Jie, Zhou, Long Feng, and Bi Gan sought to lead them to goodness but were punished; the reckless warriors of Jie’s court and the flattering ministers of Zhou’s court led them to evil, and they acted accordingly. Those who can be led to evil but not to goodness are called the utterly foolish. Duke Huan of Qi, when aided by Guan Zhong, became a hegemon; when aided by Shu Diao, he fell into chaos. Those who can be led to either goodness or evil are called the average person.\"\n\nThus, the nine ranks are established, and the classics and their traditions are thoroughly examined. The succession of generations is arranged to encompass the essentials of antiquity and the present:\n\nThe highest of the highest, the sagely ones: Fuxi, the Taihao Emperor; Shennong, the Yan Emperor; the Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan; Shaohao, the Jintian clan; Zhuanxu, the Gaoyang clan; Emperor Ku, the Gaoxin clan; Emperor Yao, the Taotang clan; Emperor Shun, the Youyu clan; Emperor Yu, the Xiahou clan; Emperor Tang, the Shang clan; King Wen of Zhou; King Wu; and the Duke of Zhou; and Confucius.\n\nFuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor are the Three Sovereigns. Shaohao, Zhuanxu, Gaoxin, Yao, and Shun are the Five Emperors—this is already stated in the *Preface to the Book of Documents*. Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu are the Three Kings.",

Confucius traced his lineage to Yao and Shun, taking King Wen and King Wu as his models. Above, he aligned with the celestial seasons; below, he followed the patterns of water and earth. He composed the Six Classics, leaving instructions for ten thousand generations.

I have appended the critiques of Zhang and Yan to the end.\n\nZhang said: Laozi’s silence was what Confucius took as his teacher. Though not among the sages, he was surely a great worthy. Wenbo’s father was well-versed in ritual canons; his actions were praised by the sages, and his words became models for later generations—yet he was placed in the fourth rank. Tian Dan, with the isolated city of Jimo, restored the might of Qi; Lu Lian’s broad learning made him indifferent to glory and profit; Lanzi overawed the King of Qin and deferred to Lian Po—yet these were ranked fifth. The Grand Concubine Ji indulged in sorcery and was fond of sacrificing to ghosts and spirits; the people of Chen emulated her, and the state abounded in licentious sacrifices. The eunuch Mencius violated the great elegance, preserving himself only through castration; filled with resentment, he composed biting satires—yet these were ranked sixth. The depravity of Miao Du’s lewdness, confounding and disordering ritual norms, was too vile to recount—yet he was placed in the seventh. The remaining discrepancies are numerous and tangled.\n\nOriginally, this work was not yet complete when I encountered the disaster of the Dou family, which may explain such errors.\n\nYan said: The theories of the six schools differ in weight. The hundred practices vary in their inclinations and rejections, making uniformity difficult. Zhang expressed his views and selectively cited the *History of Ban*. Yet even in his compilation, there are still significant inconsistencies. He merely recognized the titles of the ancient emperors and kings. As for the various personages recorded in the histories and biographies, no explanation is needed. Only when matters are obscure or uncertain does he occasionally address them.",

      "translated_text": "Shaozi said: Among people, there are differences of tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, each further divided into sixteen grades. From the supreme emperors and kings above to the scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants below, the worthy and the foolish stand far apart, utterly distinct.\n\nMan is the highest of all creatures. The sage is the highest of men. If one being is born among a trillion creatures, is he not a man? If one man is born among a trillion men, is he not a sage?\n\nThus, among a thousand thousand commoners, one who divides himself from the multitude is a petty man. Among one by one scholars, one who encompasses a trillion people is a great man. Creatures vary in size, and men vary in worth.\n\nTherefore, it is said: There are men who are worth one man, ten men, a hundred men, a thousand men, ten thousand men, a hundred million men, and a trillion men.\n\nIt is also said: Men are of three ranks, wherein good and evil reside. The highest rank is good without teaching; the middle rank becomes good after teaching; the lowest rank remains ungood even after teaching. Those who are good without teaching—what are they if not sages? Those who become good after teaching—what are they if not the worthy? Those who remain ungood even after teaching—what are they if not fools?\n\nNow, when we speak of teaching, we mean teaching those who can be taught. Those who cannot be taught are beyond the reach of instruction. Though they cannot be taught, they may still be warned, perhaps to avoid falling into vicious power.\n\nThus, those who do good are called auspicious men, and those who do evil are called inauspicious men. The auspicious man’s eyes do not gaze upon colors contrary to ritual propriety, his ears do not hear sounds contrary to ritual propriety, his mouth does not speak words contrary to ritual propriety, and his feet do not tread upon ground contrary to ritual propriety. He does not associate with those who depart from the Dao, nor does he accept what is not righteous. He seeks the worthy as if starving or parched, and avoids evil as if fleeing a pit or net. His goodness is like gold and stone, his weight like hills and mountains, his bearing like the luan and phoenix, and his qi like orchids and irises.\n\nSome say: If he is not called an auspicious man, the Five Constants are not to be believed.\n\nThe inauspicious man’s speech is perilous and rash; he pursues fame and chases wrongdoing. He indulges in wine and lust, hates the upright and reviles the just, delights in disaster and rejoices in misfortune. He resents the good and virtuous as if they were enemies, and violates laws and statutes as if they were his bedding. In minor cases, he harms himself and destroys his nature; in major cases, he overthrows his clan and severs his ancestral sacrifices.\n\nSome say: If he is not called an inauspicious man, I do not believe it.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: Without the accumulation of good, one cannot establish a name. Without the accumulation of evil, one cannot destroy oneself. This is what is meant.\n\nMaster Zhang of Nanxuan said: Men are of three ranks. The highest does not change, the lowest does not change, and those who sway this world are always the middle rank. When gentlemen gather in the court, all are transformed to goodness—then there are two parts gentlemen to one part petty man. When petty men gain influence, the middle rank is all drawn in—then there are two parts petty men to one part gentleman.\n\nI say: Kangjie’s words teach men to do good. Nanxuan’s words urge the court to employ the goodness of gentlemen. When the household is ordered, the state is governed. The words of these two masters may serve as a model for ten thousand generations.\n\nShao further said: In the age of Yao and Shun, it was difficult to be a petty man. Though the Four Fiends existed, they could not unleash their evil. In the age of Shang Zhou, it was difficult to be a gentleman. Though the Three Benevolent Ones existed, they could not fully realize their goodness. This, too, depends on how those above transform and change.\n\nMaster Cheng said: By nature, men are similar; by habit, they grow apart. This refers to the nature of qi and disposition, not the original nature.\n\nMaster Zhang said: After form comes the nature of qi and disposition. Returning to it, the nature of Heaven and Earth remains. Thus, in the nature of qi and disposition, the gentleman has that which is not nature.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Among men’s similar qi and dispositions, there are also fixed differences of beauty and ugliness that cannot be altered by habit—these are the utterly foolish.\n\nSomeone asked: What is the original nature?\n\nHe replied: Mencius’s teaching of the goodness of nature is correct. This is what Master Cheng called the nature of the utmost origin and the most profound source. This is what Master Zhang called the one source of the ten thousand things—the nature of Heaven and Earth. It is the flowing of heavenly principle before receiving life, what is called “tranquil at birth.” What lies beyond this cannot be spoken of; it may also be called fate.\n\nSpeaking of it in terms of principle, without admixture of qi and disposition, it is the original state that Heaven-and-Earth bestows upon the ten thousand things—pure and perfectly good. Descending into man, it resides within qi and disposition. Thus, it is said to be inherently good. Returning to it, the nature of Heaven and Earth remains. This means that the nature of Heaven and Earth has never departed from within qi and disposition. Thus, it is said: After form comes the nature of qi and disposition.\n\nAgain, he was asked: What is the nature of qi and disposition?\n\nHe replied: What gives birth to the ten thousand things is principle. What generates the ten thousand things is qi and disposition. Men and things receive this qi and disposition to form their shapes, and the principle within them is called nature. However, what is called qi and disposition has unevenness in its bias, correctness, purity, impurity, clarity, obscurity, thickness, and thinness. Thus, the nature within it also varies in its manifestations.\n\nGaozi’s saying that “life is what is called nature,” Master Cheng’s “nature of birth and disposition,” Xunzi’s “nature is evil,” Yang Xiong’s “good and evil are mixed,” and Han Yu’s “three ranks” all refer to the nature of qi and disposition, yet they do not know the original nature.\n\nI say: Mencius taught the goodness of nature and understood the root, yet he did not speak of qi and disposition, which is why he gave rise to the disputes of Xun, Yang, and Han. Thus, Master Cheng said: To discuss nature without discussing qi is incomplete. Xun, Yang, and Han spoke of the nature of qi and disposition, yet they did not know what nature truly is. Only after more than a thousand years after Confucius and Mencius, with the advent of Lian and Han, did this become clear.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is also said: To discuss qi without discussing nature is unclear. Huang Mianzhai remarked: Master Zhang of Hengqu distinguished between the nature of Heaven and Earth and the nature of qi and disposition, after which Master Zhu’s doctrine was established. Truly, these words are correct.\n\nIt is further said: Qi may be biased or upright, and the principle it receives follows accordingly in bias or uprightness. Qi may be dull or bright, and the principle it receives follows accordingly in dullness or brightness. When wood-qi is abundant, metal-qi declines, hence benevolence is often plentiful while righteousness is often scarce. When metal-qi is abundant, wood-qi declines, hence righteousness is often plentiful while benevolence is often scarce. Such is the nature of qi and disposition, which possesses both good and evil. Since there exists a nature of good and evil in qi and disposition, it is not the original nature of Heaven and Earth.\n\nIf one seeks it in Zisi’s “centrality before arousal,” when this heart is unaroused, its center is serene, and myriad thoughts do not arise—this is the pure and perfectly good nature of Heaven and Earth. Thus, though qi may be biased, principle remains upright; though qi may be dull, principle remains bright. Though qi may be deficient or excessive, principle knows no victory or defeat. Yet when it is stirred by external things, qi moves and principle follows. Or principle moves and qi carries it along—thus the perfectly good principle submits to qi, and good and evil are thereby distinguished.\n\nThe late Master once said: Before this heart is aroused, qi does not act. This is why there is good without evil. It is further said: Why is nature near while habit is distant? It is replied: Speaking of what is constant, those whose nature is good become habituated to goodness and daily advance toward loftiness and clarity. Those whose nature is evil become habituated to evil and daily sink into filth and baseness. Speaking of what changes, those whose nature is good may become habituated to evil and lose their goodness. Those whose nature is evil may become habituated to goodness and lose their evil. In all four cases, they begin close but end far apart.\n\nCiting Master Cheng’s words: Human nature is originally good. Speaking of talent, however, there are those of the lowest stupidity who cannot be changed. There are two kinds of lowest stupidity: self-abandonment and self-neglect. If one governs oneself with goodness, there is nothing that cannot be changed. Even the most dull and foolish can gradually be polished and improved. Only the self-abandoning reject it with disbelief, and the self-neglecting sever it with inaction. Though they dwell with a sage, they cannot be transformed and entered—this is what Confucius called the lowest stupidity. Yet their endowment is not necessarily dull and foolish. Often they are strong-willed and surpass others in talent and strength, as was the case with King Zhou of Shang. The sage, seeing that they have cut themselves off from goodness, calls them the lowest stupidity. Yet examining their end, they are indeed foolish.\n\nIt is also said: The moment one becomes lax is the moment of self-abandonment and self-neglect. Master Zhu said: The self-abandoning have a defiant intent. They do not despise ritual and righteousness but simply refuse to listen to good words. The self-neglecting have a weak intent. They acknowledge that ritual and righteousness are good and accept others’ advice, yet they themselves do not act.\n\nMaster Zhang said: When virtue does not overcome qi, one’s nature and destiny are commanded by qi. When virtue overcomes qi, one’s nature and destiny are commanded by virtue. To exhaust principle and fulfill nature is to align one’s nature, Heaven, virtue, destiny, and the heavenly principle. What cannot be changed in qi is only life and death, longevity and premature death. Thus, in discussing life and death, one says “it is destiny,” speaking of qi. In discussing wealth and honor, one says “it is in Heaven,” speaking of principle. This is why great virtue necessarily receives destiny.\n\nMaster Lü said: The reason the noble person studies is to transform qi and disposition. When virtue overcomes qi and disposition, the foolish can advance toward clarity and the weak toward strength. If one cannot overcome them, then even with the aspiration to study, the foolish cannot become clear and the weak cannot stand firm.\n\nThat which is uniformly good without evil is nature, common to all people. That which is endowed with varying degrees of dullness, brightness, strength, and weakness is talent, differing among people. Sincerity is the means to return to what is common and transform what differs. To seek beauty from an unlovely endowment requires a hundredfold effort to achieve it. Now, with a careless and reckless approach to study—sometimes practicing, sometimes stopping—one attempts to transform an unlovely endowment. When it fails to change, one says, “My endowment is not beautiful; it cannot be transformed by study.” This is truly self-abandonment, and its unbenevolence is extreme.\n\nThat great virtue necessarily receives destiny means that virtue is principle. Master Cheng said: To act is to carry out the heavenly mandate, to reach the heavenly principle. To necessarily receive destiny is to obtain its response. Heaven’s retribution is like shadow and echo. To receive its retribution is the constant principle; not to receive it is the exceptional principle. Yet people, in their shallowness and narrowness, seek it amiss, for the heavenly mandate cannot be altered. However, what can be altered is within the power of those with virtue. Through cultivation, one may extend years and generations. Praying to Heaven for eternal destiny, or for ordinary people to become sages and worthies—all follow this Way.\n\nMaster Hou said: Those who obtain the constant are like Shun. Those who do not obtain the constant are like Confucius. Shun rose from a commoner to possess the world—those who plant nurture it. Jie fell from Son of Heaven to a commoner—those who overturn topple it. Heaven does not establish or abolish principles for Shun or Jie; it is inherently so. Extending this principle, one can grasp the pattern in all things.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Transformation does not occur in a single day through sudden enlightenment. The advancement of human virtue is likewise. “At thirty, one stands.” Before reaching thirty, one must stand; one must begin at fifteen with the aspiration to learn and gradually transform. “Not deluded,” “knowing destiny,” “ear harmony,” and “following the heart” are all the same.\n\nMaster Hu said: “At fifteen, Confucius aspired to learn.”",

      "translated_text": "Zigong said: \"When the Master governed a state or household, those he established stood firm, those he guided advanced, those he pacified came, and those he moved harmonized—could Heaven alone achieve such? I say: The Sage’s learning knows no bounds with Heaven, like laying the foundation for a thousand myriad years. Yet his aspirations were vast and enduring, so before thirty, he transformed every fifteen years. Entering the learning of the great person, he opened his resolve, and after another fifteen years, having long maintained his course, what he learned remained unchanged, and he stood firm with established virtue. Thereafter, he advanced steadily, transforming every ten years, progressing gradually. Having passed beyond doubt, he advanced to firmness, thus penetrating the principles of all things as they ought to be, without uncertainty. After another ten years, knowing Heaven’s mandate, doubt was no longer worth mentioning. This heart and Heaven’s mandate flowed together without obstruction. After another ten years, his understanding entered his heart, and nothing hindered him—he attained without deliberation. Through long accumulation of cultivation, he reached the state where his heart’s desires followed without transgressing the bounds. In these ten years, he acted with ease, hitting the mark without effort. For the Master’s learning was the learning of the great person of Qian. The first thirty years were divided into two stages to open the foundation of his vast and enduring resolve. The latter thirty years were divided into three stages to reach the state where his heart’s desires followed without transgressing the bounds. Unshakable was his resolve in learning, guarding against evil and preserving sincerity to stand firm. Knowing the end as well as the beginning was freedom from doubt. Harmony between sound and qi was attunement of the ear. Thus he saw Heaven’s pattern without transgressing the bounds. Therefore it is said: The great person harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth, his brightness with the sun and moon, his order with the four seasons, and his auspices and omens with ghosts and spirits. How could this be achieved by a single day’s effort? Thus I say: The Master’s learning was the learning of the great person of Qian.\n\nHuang Mianzhai said: Some explain that the Sage established standards with humble words to encourage others, but if the Sage’s words were all empty and vain, how could they reflect the Sage’s upright and magnanimous heart? Profound indeed is this saying. Master Zhu also said: The Sage did not feign humility while being truly sagely in heart. He further said: \"Extending knowledge\" and \"making intentions sincere\" are two thresholds for learners. Extending knowledge is the threshold between dream and awakening; making intentions sincere is the threshold between good and evil. Passing through the threshold of extending knowledge is awakening, otherwise one remains in dream. Passing through the threshold of making intentions sincere is goodness, otherwise one remains in evil.\n\nHeaven is man, and man is Heaven. At the beginning of a person’s life, what he receives from Heaven is already within him. Once this person exists, Heaven is also within him. All speech, sight, hearing, and movement are of Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Hold fast to Heaven’s bright mandate,\" always seeing this principle clearly before one’s eyes. Learning the basics is a matter of practice. Principle resides within practice. If one can fully master the basics, then learning the basics leads to reaching the heights, and Heavenly principle is present. This is what it means for a person to be born—principle and qi unite. All thoughts, considerations, words, and deeds are qi, yet principle abides within them. Thus the Five Constants and the myriad virtues all manifest principle.\n\nMaster Zhen of Xishan said: \"Exhausting principle\" pertains to knowledge, leaving no thing uninvestigated. \"Fulfilling nature\" pertains to action, leaving no principle unembodied. When knowledge is fully exhausted and action is fully realized, one reaches the mandate. The mandate is what Heaven bestows upon me. The round outside and the hollow within are the substance of the heart; empty spirituality and awareness are its function; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom are its principles.\n\nMaster Hu of Wufeng said: Great indeed is nature! The myriad virtues are complete within it. Heaven and Earth are established thereby. A spring-fed stream, though cold, does not freeze. A person of virtue, though in dire straits, does not falter. When the sun sets, its light is entrusted to the moon. When Confucius passed, the Dao was entrusted to Meng. Master Zhou said: The sage emulates Heaven, the worthy emulates the sage, and the scholar emulates the worthy. Yi Yin and Yan Yuan were great worthies. Yi Yin felt shame if his lord was not like Yao or Shun, and if a single person was not in their proper place, it was as if he were flogged in the marketplace. Yan Yuan did not shift his anger, did not repeat his errors, and for three months did not stray from benevolence. Aspire to Yi Yin’s aspirations, learn what Yanzi learned. Surpass them and you become a sage; equal them and you become a worthy; fall short and you still do not lose a good name.\n\nMaster Zhu said: According to the depth of one’s effort, one reaches near or far without losing a good name, for one possesses the reality of doing good. Thus Master Hu said: If one dissuades people from making official rank, wealth, and family prosperity their aim to seek favor, then say: \"Aspire to Yi Yin’s aspirations.\" If one dissuades people from taking knowledge and learning as attainment and complacently resting without seeking to advance, then say: \"Learn what Yanzi learned.\" Only when one truly establishes Yi Yin’s aspirations and cultivates Yanzi’s learning does one realize that the words of the *Tongshu* encompass the utmost greatness, and the undertakings of the Sage’s gate are boundless.\n\nI say: For scholars who wish to transform their qi and disposition, nothing is greater than emulating the sage and emulating Heaven. Yet one must begin by emulating the worthy. Yi Yin, while plowing at Xin and delighting in the Dao, never lacked Yan Yuan’s learning. Yan Yuan, though dwelling in a humble alley, asked about governing a state, never lacking Yi Yin’s aspirations. Had these two great worthies exchanged places, both would have been the same. If scholars can reflect on themselves and be sincere, not engaging in superficial adornment, emulating them will surely succeed. Establish resolve and study with sincerity, without shame before oneself. Serve parents and follow elder brothers with sincerity, without shame before one’s family. Be loyal, trustworthy, earnest, and respectful with sincerity, without shame before one’s village.",
      "overlap_context": "sperity, advantage, and perseverance—are practiced with clarity, flowing harmoniously with the myriad things, each attaining its proper place without disorder.\n\n\"At sixty, one’s ear is attuned.\" What does this attunement mean? It means that what passes is transformed, what remains is spirit-like, nearly attaining the realm of Heaven.\n\n\"At seventy, one follows the heart’s desires without overstepping the bounds.\" What does this mean? It means that one’s movements are of Heaven, and thus it is so.",

      "translated_text": "Advance in thought to exhaust loyalty with sincerity, without shame before one’s office. Possess the goodness of substance prevailing, without the disgrace of reputation prevailing. Proceeding thus and holding fast, the worthy may be emulated. Abiding in nature and resting in it, the sage may be emulated. Its subtleties are invisible when issuing forth, its fullness is inexhaustible when expanding, and Heaven may be emulated. Those who aspire to the resolve of Yi and the learning of Yan—can they not seek these within themselves?\n\nMaster Cheng said: When the expansive power is fully realized, then Heaven and Earth transform and the grasses and trees flourish abundantly. When the expansive power is not realized, then Heaven and Earth close and the worthy withdraw into obscurity.\n\nMaster Zhu said: What one does not desire, do not impose upon others. Simply persist in expanding and advancing, and the myriad things will each attain their proper place. Expand it within a single household, a single state, or the entire world, and none will fail to attain their proper place. How then could Heaven and Earth not transform, or grasses and trees not flourish? If the expansive power is not realized, then upon stepping outside, one immediately encounters obstruction.\n\nThe *Book of Mencius* is simply about expanding the expansive power, daily gathering in one’s straying heart. This is drawing inward from without, daily knowing and expanding it. One must also push outward from within, hence it is said: Cultivate the self and the world is at peace—all of this does not go beyond the single word *shu* (reciprocity).\n\nMaster Zhu said: Reverence to straighten the inner, rightness to square the outer. These eight characters are inexhaustible in a lifetime’s use. When reverence is established, the inner is straight; when rightness takes form, the outer is square—this can be relied upon for a lifetime. Rightness is the heart’s judgment in affairs. When the heart judges within, the outer becomes square and upright, and the myriad things each attain their due.\n\nThe *Cinnabar Scripture* says: When reverence overcomes indolence, there is good fortune; when indolence overcomes reverence, there is ruin. When rightness overcomes desire, there is compliance; when desire overcomes rightness, there is misfortune. Reverence stands upright; indolence collapses. Acting according to principle is rightness; not acting according to principle is desire.\n\nFurthermore, the character *zhi* (straight) is explained by *jing* (reverence), and *fang* (square) by *yi* (rightness). Reverence without rightness leads to errors in conduct. Rightness without reverence lacks a foundation. Only when reverence and rightness are established together does one avoid the isolation of \"straightening the inner with reverence.\" \"Squaring the outer with rightness\" is the work of learning.\n\n\"Straight\" means direct and unobstructed, with no trace of crookedness in the breast—this is the meaning of decisive and square integrity. Reverence is like a mirror; rightness is the reverence that can reflect. Without rightness, reverence is dead and lifeless, not the living reverence.\n\nIt is also said: One must make this a fundamental concern. When nurturing it to the point of thorough penetration, \"reverence to straighten the inner\" naturally leads to \"rightness to square the outer.\" Even in quiet sitting, one must examine reverence and dissipation. Reverence is the heavenly principle; dissipation is human desire. In one’s dwelling, one must examine whether one is respectful or not; in handling affairs, whether one is reverent or not.\n\nThere are those who focus solely on understanding the state of quiescent non-movement. Yet when they encounter affairs, they become utterly disordered, disturbing even their quiescent state. Others focus solely on handling affairs but neglect the foundational work. One must be thorough from top to bottom, penetrating both inner and outer, to be truly adequate.\n\nIt is also said: Reverence is the virtue of Heaven. Reverence thoroughly penetrates above and below, without distinction from Heaven.\n\nMaster Cheng said: \"Do not be irreverent\"—this can be used to respond to the Lord on High.\n\nMaster Fan said: The three hundred canons of ritual and three thousand rules of decorum—one phrase summarizes them all: \"Do not be irreverent.\"\n\nMaster Zhu said: Yao was the first sage to emerge and govern; the *Canon of Yao* in the *Book of Documents* is the first canonical text. In describing Yao’s virtue, no other word is used before \"reverent.\" Now, when examining the sages and worthies, though their words number in the thousands, and their affairs range from great to small, none do not originate in reverence. When one gathers one’s spirit here, one can fully perceive the principle, and only then can one cultivate the self, order the household, and extend it to the world.\n\nWhat form or shadow does reverence have? It is simply the gathering of body and mind. Not allowing a single thing to intrude is to be single-minded. Mingdao taught people to sit in quietude, as did Master Li. One must sit quietly to gather oneself; only then, when facing affairs, will one have strength.\n\nIt is also said: The character *jing* (reverence) pervades both movement and stillness.\n\nMaster Zhen said: If the winter qi fails to close and store properly, and warmth prevails without frost or snow, then the following year’s yang qi will lack strength, and the five grains will not ripen. The human heart is the same. If in stillness one is scattered and anxious, how can one be measured in activity? Thus Master Zhou took \"abiding in stillness\" as fundamental, and Master Cheng took \"abiding in reverence\" as fundamental—both express this principle.\n\nMaster Hu of Wuyi said: The single character *jing* (reverence)—after ten years of devoted practice, one must distinguish it.\n\nMaster Zhu said: It seems that even Heaven and Earth have a governing principle; only then can they undergo their transformations—this is the reverence of Heaven and Earth. That by which King Tang could match the Lord on High began with his daily ascent in sagely reverence.\n\nI note: Master Lü of Donglai said: Reverence is the first word transmitted by the hundred sages. Where the sagely learning applies effort, even in the *Book of the Charge*, it is said: The subtle transmission of the Duke of Zhou was received by King Cheng. As he neared his end, he revealed it to his ministers. The subtle transmission of Confucius was received by Zengzi. As he neared his end, he revealed it to Meng Jingzi. Both centered on reverence alone.\n\nThe complete embodiment of the Supreme Polarity in the sage requires no cultivation yet remains in reverence—how much more so for scholars! Those who know this and cultivate it are the good fortune of the noble person; those who do not know this and act contrary to it are the misfortune of the petty person. Whether one cultivates or acts contrary depends entirely on the distinction between reverence and dissipation.\n\nWhen reverent, desires diminish and principle becomes clear. Diminishing them further and further to the point of nonexistence, the sagely learning may be emulated. Thus Master Zhu said: What Master Cheng contributed most powerfully to later scholars was the single character *jing* (reverence).",
