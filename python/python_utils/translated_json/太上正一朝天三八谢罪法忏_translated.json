The Law permits renewal through self-correction.\n\nThis servant of the Dao, [Name], now burns incense and prostrates a hundred times, reverently memorializing:\nThe Three Clarities and Supreme Saints,\nThe Ten Poles and Lofty Perfected,\nThe Jade Emperor of August Heaven, the Great Heavenly Honored One,\nThe Highest Sovereign of the Mysterious Vault,\nThe Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water,\nThe Grand Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teaching and Assists the Primordial,\nThe Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity Who Subtly Transforms, Serenely Responds, Manifestly Protects, and Divinely Blesses,\nThe Perfected Lords of the Orthodox Unity Lineage: the Female Master, the Succession Master, and the Lineage Master,\nThe Two Perfected Lords Wang and Zhao,\nThe Five Thearchs and Six Palaces,\nThe Four Offices and Nine Bureaus,\nThe Officers and Generals of the Registers of the Law,\nThe Deities of the Three Realms,\nThe City Gods and Sacrificial Rites,\nAll responsive and perceptive numinous spirits—\n\nMay they all deign to cast their radiance and witness this repentance.\n\nI, your servant [Name], prostrate in reflection:\nFrom the beginningless beginning until now, through all my existences...\n\nThough but a single thought strayed in blind wandering, the six senses became entangled;\nIndulging the three karmas without awareness, the ten evils accumulated and grew.\nI knew only to gallop through the red dust, never considering the marks recorded in the black ledger.\nNow, pressing hand to heart, I know fear; touching self, I startle as if alarmed.\n\nToday, reverently observing this sacred festival, I humbly follow the Master of Heaven’s teachings and rites,\nbowing a hundred times toward heaven, offering wholehearted repentance.\nI lift my gaze to the exalted Perfected Ones, beseeching their compassion;\nto the great Dao, entreating merciful pity for this foolish and benighted one,\nthat they might bend to grant pardon and absolution.\nMay they purge the records of my past transgressions,\nfreeing me from the Dark Pass where the Primordial Ancestors hold me bound;\nmay they open the gate to reform and goodness,\nthat my innermost heart may be illumined and my true nature made clear.\nMay the mysterious power be fully perfected, the Dao’s practice harmoniously complete.\nMay my every movement and stillness be peaceful,\nand my karmic affinities prosper in felicity.\n\nYour servant, in deepest humility, gazes toward heaven and longs for the sacred,\noverwhelmed with fervent trepidation.\nWith utmost sincerity, I perform the three rites of reverence.\n\nTo the Most High, Boundless Great Dao—\nwith wholehearted devotion, I bow in homage to the thirty-six divisions of the venerable scriptures.\nTo the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center—\n\nIn former times, the Ancestral Celestial Master dwelled upon Cloud Terrace Mountain in Langzhou.\nIn the year bing-shen, the third year of Yongshou (ninth month, ninth day),\nthe Most High dispatched envoys to bestow upon him a jade tablet,\nconferring the titles *Great Dharma Master of the Three Heavens Who Upholds the Teaching and Assists the Primordial* and *Perfected Lord of Orthodox Unity*.\nAt the appointed hour of his ascension, at midday,\ncrimson-robed attendants held tablets, silk-clad ones bore the casket,\nwhile twenty-four immortals, dragons and tigers, deer and cranes,\nazure banners and scarlet standards, colored clouds and purple mists,\nheavenly incense redolent, immortal music lingering—\ntwo jade maidens led the Celestial Master and his consort, Lady Yong,\nto mount the jeweled chariot and ascend through the clouds to the Terrace of the Great Mystery.\nAt that time, his disciples, numbering three thousand six hundred,\nclung in longing, their grief and joy intermingled.\n\nThey recited the Master’s titles, seeking ordination and immortal names. The Celestial Master permitted only Wang and Zhao, the two immortal disciples, whose past karma was pure and whose meritorious practices were complete, to ascend together to the celestial palace. Thereupon, he transmitted to his successor the talismans, registers, seals, swords, the Three Caverns’ scriptures, and the rites of repentance and deliverance bestowed by the Most High. Thus, the successor withdrew to cultivate his former practices, repent his transgressions, and refine his merits. On the fifteenth day of the first month in the second year of Guanghe, he ascended by imperial decree upon Mount Ganyang.\n\nThereafter, the successor transmitted these true rites to the Ordination Master and the Hidden Lineage Master. Though those who sought ordination as immortal disciples were earnest, many still bore the burdens of past lives. Some diligently cultivated yet faltered; the Dao makes no distinction between near and far. Thus, they revolve through the Three Realms and Five Wheels, for they possess the six roots, which give rise to the ten evils. Accumulated habits and transgressions stem from former kalpas; obstacles and delusions in the pursuit of the Dao arise in this present life.\n\nThe first is the eye-root; the second, the ear-root; the third, the nose-root; the fourth, the tongue-root; the fifth, the body-root; the sixth, the mind-root. From these six roots arise all karmic deeds, like grasses and trees that sprout branches, spread leaves, bloom, and bear fruit, ever proliferating. Those who cultivate them may attain right stabilization of the six roots, and all transgressions will naturally be purified.\n\nFurthermore, the three evil deeds of the body—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct—are formed by the body-root. The three evil deeds of the mind—greed, hatred, and delusion—are formed by the mind-root. The four evil deeds of the mouth—duplicity, harsh speech, frivolous talk, and falsehood—are formed by the tongue-root. From these three karmic deeds arise the ten evils, like serpents and scorpions that wield their venom in self-defense, striking and wounding others, ever growing more fierce. Those who cultivate them may attain wisdom, and the ten evils and all transgressions will naturally be purified.\n\nIn former times, the Ancestral Celestial Master specially practiced the Most High’s *Cultivation of Perfection*, the *Rites of Repentance and Deliverance*, and the *True Writs of the Mysterious Ancestor’s Ordinances*, thereby instantly dissolving past karma, perfecting Daoist merits, delivering his ancestors, and ascending bodily into flight. How much more so for people of this degenerate age, who commit many transgressions! To unite form and spirit with the Dao, one must instantly dissolve all karmic obstructions. One should follow the rites of repentance on the three eights, confessing the offenses and faults accumulated over past lives and present existence. With utmost sincerity, repent and prostrate a hundred times toward heaven. With wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the *Jade Emperor, Great Celestial Worthy* and the *August Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Heavens*. Make vows, counting each day as a year: swear to sever the three poisons and the ten evils, and vow to cultivate the one thousand three hundred virtues. Thus may one gradually enter the immortal lineage and, step by step, ascend the celestial path. You should transmit these teachings in succession and diligently practice them. The Dao is compassionate and responds to the sincerity of the heart. Repentance dissolves transgressions; cultivation generates blessings. Now, therefore, take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\nWith devoted heart, prostrate and pay homage to the *Most High of the Boundless Heaven of Mi Luo*.\nIn the wondrous realm of Mysterious Perfection, the distant Purple Gold Palace,\nThe Jade Pure Palace of the Grand Tenuity, the peerless and supreme Sage,\nRadiant beyond the void, serene and vast without origin,\nEncompassing the ten directions, the tranquil and constant Dao.\nThe vast and boundless, the wondrously potent *Jade Emperor, Great Celestial Worthy* and the *August Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Heavens*.\n\nTen prostrations.\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is first: killing. Endowed with a cruel nature, we indulge in slaughter, inflict brutal punishments, harm beings, and injure life. We shoot flying birds, pursue running beasts, overturn nests and uproot hibernating creatures, scald with boiling water and burn with fire, abort fetuses and destroy eggs, provide for our mouths and bellies, flatter and sacrifice to evil spirits, plot murder, incite murder, commit murder intentionally or by mistake. Revolving in the cycle of rebirth, we mutually harm one another. From this day forth, we repent and humbly seek forgiveness. May we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Compassionate Salvation and forever sever the karma of killing. May our ancestors be delivered and forever escape the retribution of hanging upside down and being butchered. May we, your disciples, receive grace and, in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruit of long life and enduring vision. May form and spirit both be wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Now, therefore, we take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\n*Jade Edict*—as before, ten prostrations.\n\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is second: stealing. Harboring deceit and scheming, we pilfer and break in, betray the public for private gain, deceive openly and cheat in secret. We steal from parents, from the sovereign, from the Three Treasures, from the five clans, ever increasing without restraint, ever ignorant and foolish. We encroach, plunder, and rob, heedless of gratitude or righteousness, unafraid of divine judgment, unmoved by the distress of those we harm, rejoicing only in what we gain. From this day forth, we repent and humbly seek absolution. May we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Integrity and Frugality and forever sever the karma of stealing. May our ancestors be delivered and forever escape the retribution of golden hammers and iron staves. May we, your disciples, receive grace and, in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruit of honor and prosperity. May form and spirit both be wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Now, therefore, we take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\n*Jade Edict*—ten prostrations.\n\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is third: sexual misconduct. Our natures are impure, our passions frivolous; we indulge in lust and crave desire, harbor love and hatred, jealousy and envy, defile and disrupt the rites and scriptures, disregard kinship and propriety, willfully violate prohibitions and precepts. We entertain lewd thoughts and fantasies, exhausting our qi and deranging our spirits, indulging recklessly in ignorance, seeking pleasure without restraint, seducing and tempting all, baring ourselves before the Three Luminaries.\n\nMen fail in loyalty and goodness, women lack chastity and purity; they wander recklessly down crooked paths, losing the true Way, drowning in rivers of love, drifting toward seas of desire. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution. May all beings together enter the Gate of Purity, forever severing the karma of sexual misconduct. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of icy spears and frosty blades; may we, the disciples, receive grace, and in heaven and on earth, attain the full fruition of blessings as we wish. Body and spirit both wondrous, in harmony with the true Dao. Thus we take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, your subjects, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mind’s karma is first: greed. Driven by the poison of greed, we are miserly and stingy, grasping without regard for righteousness, craving love without end; we scheme and contrive, resort to heterodox arts and deviant paths, harm others to benefit ourselves, injure creatures and take lives. We overcharge and extort, forcibly seize and encroach; like a bottomless ravine, we devise a hundred schemes, refuse to repay debts, deny entrusted goods, rely on power and influence to resist and deceive, betray lives, betray wealth, betray kindness, betray righteousness. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution. May all beings together enter the Gate of Giving, forever severing the karma of miserliness and greed. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of iron beds and copper pillars; may we, the disciples, receive grace, and in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruition of joy, peace, and prosperity. Body and spirit both wondrous, in harmony with the Dao. Thus we take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, your subjects, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mind’s karma is second: hatred. The fire of wrath blazes fiercely, the karmic winds scatter wildly; we rely on strength to bully the weak, incite the many to oppress the few, are arrogant toward superiors and disdainful toward inferiors, envy the worthy and resent the capable. Sometimes we direct our rage wantonly at the sun, moon, and stars; sometimes we direct our rage wantonly at parents and teachers; we oppress servants and laborers, directing our rage wantonly at the slightest inconvenience. Our venomous words surpass wasps and scorpions, our treacherous hearts are sharper than wind and blade; outwardly we forge enmity and resentment, inwardly we harbor fury and rage. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution. May all beings together enter the Gate of Joy, forever severing the karma of wrath and anger. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of flying spears and drifting halberds; may we, the disciples, receive grace, and in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruition of dignified and majestic forms. Body and spirit both wondrous, in harmony with the true Dao. Thus we take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, your subjects, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mind’s karma is third: ignorance. We are unfilial and disloyal, inhumane and unrighteous; we are arrogant toward the Three Treasures, disrespectful toward the Three Luminaries, publicly engage in deceit, secretly harbor malice, defy heaven and violate earth, act contrary to reason and indulge in arrogance, profane and disrupt canonical norms, wallow in debauchery and defilement. We knowingly commit sins, deliberately do wrong; outwardly we forget the dignity of restraint, inwardly we harbor violent and cruel intentions. We are lewd and defiled, scorn our kin, act recklessly and wildly, fiercely and perversely. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution. May all beings together enter the Gate of Wisdom, forever severing the karma of ignorance. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of knife mountains and sword trees; may we, the disciples, receive grace, and in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruition of wisdom and intelligence. Body and spirit both wondrous, in harmony with the true Dao. Thus we take refuge, prostrating with sincere devotion.\n\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, your subjects, with devoted sincerity take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is first: divisive speech. Our words are perverse and rebellious, we slander and malign the good, deceive and confuse in many ways, argue stubbornly against reason, revile the Three Treasures, disparage the Mahāyāna, complain of heat and resent the cold, curse the wind and rail at the rain. We fabricate lawsuits, disrupt order, entice and extort, incite strife and contention, praise to the face and slander behind the back, speak one way and think another, boast of our own abilities, expose others’ flaws, sow discord among kin and factions, stir up trouble, engage in wicked deeds and wicked words, are disloyal and untrustworthy. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution. May all beings together enter the Gate of the Three Vehicles, forever severing the karma of divisive speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of swallowing fire and eating coals; may we, the disciples, receive grace, and in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruition of auspiciousness and purity. Body and spirit both wondrous, in harmony with the true Dao. Thus we take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, your subjects, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is second: abusive speech. Long sunk in the realm of beasts, we have barely attained human form; our foul and putrid words pollute heaven and earth, our filthy and venomous voices offend the true spirits. We harass and disturb the people, intimidate and bully the gentle and weak, are insolent and disrespectful toward elders, humiliate and insult common folk. We indulge in drunkenness and feign madness, crave rich flavors, harm creatures and take lives to satisfy our appetites, incite violence and killing without a shred of compassion. We forge widespread enmity, wantonly heap defilement and disgrace. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.\n\nMay we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Expedient Means and forever sever the karma of abusive speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of scorching, searing, and charring. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of fortune, emolument, longevity, and peace. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, the disciples, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, bowing a hundred times toward heaven, repenting with a single heart.\n\nWe reflect again: from past lives to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is third: frivolous speech. Our words transgress ritual and law, our conduct drifts into levity. We display obsequious charm, adorn our voices with ornate melody, utter lewd and profane words, embellish amorous sentiments. Our coquettish songs and melodies arouse impure thoughts in others, turning white to black, suppressing right to wrong. Our embroidered, deceptive words delude the foolish and mislead the credulous. Unaware, we darken our hidden virtue, accumulating boundless, measureless transgressions. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.\n\nMay we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Praise and forever sever the karma of frivolous speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of cauldrons, boiling water, and burning coals. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of ascending to the rank of superior immortals. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, the disciples, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, bowing a hundred times toward heaven, repenting with a single heart.\n\nWe reflect again: from past lives to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is fourth: false speech. We transgress ritual with embellished words, wield deceitful tongues with impure hearts. We fail to honor rulers, fathers, teachers, and friends; we fail to revere heaven, earth, and the divine. We fabricate groundless tales, deceive one another, incite unrest, shield faults and suppress virtues. We scheme with cunning, make falsehood our norm, swear oaths to implicate others, deceive ourselves in our innermost hearts. We curse to seek vindication, heedless of the unseen realm. We flaunt vanity, harbor suspicions, distort truth, and despise the teachings of sages and the scriptures of the great Dao, neglecting to recite and uphold them, instead slandering and disparaging them. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.\n\nMay we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Sudden Awakening and forever sever the karma of false speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of having our tongues plowed and intestines pierced. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of returning to our original, natural state. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with sincere devotion.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nAt that time, the Preceptor addressed the immortal disciples studying the Dao: \"When dwelling in the dust of the mundane world, every action becomes a transgression—boundless and measureless, difficult to recount, impossible to exhaust. Having bowed a hundred times toward heaven, we have fully confessed. The ten great evils of the mouth’s karma have now been entirely laid bare. With a single thought of reform, we instantly return to purity, like a bright mirror obscured by dust. Should it chance upon a skilled craftsman who polishes it with medicine and washing, the dust is removed, and its radiance restored. The extinction of sin and the arising of blessing are likewise.\n\nThe sagely immortals who established the teachings in the heavens constantly exhort the people of the world to diligently cultivate repentance. *Repentance* means not daring to conceal past faults; *remorse* means never again committing former wrongs. Having verbally confessed, the body bows and kneels; the heart must feel remorse and resolve to reform and turn toward goodness. Then, ten celestial deities of goodness will jointly protect and recommend us, and the immortals of the three realms will together guard and support us.\n\nShould one remain heedless and unrepentant, refusing to confess or reform, sinful roots will gradually entangle, deepening day by day. Then, the bureaus of yin and yang will examine and judge the malevolent and perverse; ghostly and demonic forces will assail, illnesses will not heal, disasters will arise in succession, public and private affairs will stagnate, and demonic obstacles will multiply.\n\nIf, in future lives, people encounter this Dao and cultivate it, they will move the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, and the Four Departments to observe their sincerity and diligence, record their merits, and pardon their transgressions. Illnesses will be cured, Daoist practices will succeed, officials will be promoted, prisoners will be freed, and no suffering or hardship will befall them. Longevity will be extended, body and mind will be at peace. If repentance is performed for the deceased, their sins will be expunged upon retrospective cultivation, their dark records erased, and their souls will ascend to the Purple Palace.\n\nIn times of famine, drought, flood, locusts, pestilence, war, or plunder, if one follows the prescribed rites and performs repentance to dispel calamities, the land will be pacified, and the people and all beings will flourish. If a woman struggles in childbirth or is troubled by ghostly apparitions and domestic misfortune, by maintaining incense offerings and performing repentance with prayers, mother and child will be safe, and the household will be tranquil.\n\nIf one constantly practices repentance and rites, studies the Dao and attains it, seeks immortality and achieves it. If one performs repentance for specific matters and wishes, whatever is sought will be fulfilled—whether in heaven or among men, in future lives or this present existence—attaining boundless blessings. The fruition of enlightenment is no empty promise.\n\nThus did the Preceptor abandon his office to refine himself, inheriting and continuing the immortal lineage. In the eighth month of the first year of Zhengshi, he ascended by imperial decree at Yangping Mountain. This true teaching is transmitted to later generations. Those with affinity will meet it, attaining self-deliverance and delivering others. May all sentient beings together reach blessed felicity.\n\nWe bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Supreme, Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\"\n\nThe *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Chao Tian San Ba Xie Zui Fa Chan* is now complete.",

      "translated_text": "They recited the Master’s titles, seeking ordination and immortal names. The Celestial Master permitted only Wang and Zhao, the two immortal disciples, whose past karma was pure and whose meritorious practices were complete, to ascend together to the celestial palace. Thereupon, he transmitted to his successor the talismans, registers, seals, swords, the Three Caverns’ scriptures, and the rites of repentance and deliverance bestowed by the Most High. Thus, the successor withdrew to cultivate his former practices, repent his transgressions, and refine his merits. On the fifteenth day of the first month in the second year of Guanghe, he ascended by imperial decree upon Mount Ganyang.\n\nThereafter, the successor transmitted these true rites to the Ordination Master and the Hidden Lineage Master. Though those who sought ordination as immortal disciples were earnest, many still bore the burdens of past lives. Some diligently cultivated yet faltered; the Dao makes no distinction between near and far. Thus, they revolve through the Three Realms and Five Wheels, for they possess the six roots, which give rise to the ten evils. Accumulated habits and transgressions stem from former kalpas; obstacles and delusions in the pursuit of the Dao arise in this present life.\n\nThe first is the eye-root; the second, the ear-root; the third, the nose-root; the fourth, the tongue-root; the fifth, the body-root; the sixth, the mind-root. From these six roots arise all karmic deeds, like grasses and trees that sprout branches, spread leaves, bloom, and bear fruit, ever proliferating. Those who cultivate them may attain right stabilization of the six roots, and all transgressions will naturally be purified.\n\nFurthermore, the three evil deeds of the body—killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct—are formed by the body-root. The three evil deeds of the mind—greed, hatred, and delusion—are formed by the mind-root. The four evil deeds of the mouth—duplicity, harsh speech, frivolous talk, and falsehood—are formed by the tongue-root. From these three karmic deeds arise the ten evils, like serpents and scorpions that wield their venom in self-defense, striking and wounding others, ever growing more fierce. Those who cultivate them may attain wisdom, and the ten evils and all transgressions will naturally be purified.\n\nIn former times, the Ancestral Celestial Master specially practiced the Most High’s *Cultivation of Perfection*, the *Rites of Repentance and Deliverance*, and the *True Writs of the Mysterious Ancestor’s Ordinances*, thereby instantly dissolving past karma, perfecting Daoist merits, delivering his ancestors, and ascending bodily into flight. How much more so for people of this degenerate age, who commit many transgressions! To unite form and spirit with the Dao, one must instantly dissolve all karmic obstructions. One should follow the rites of repentance on the three eights, confessing the offenses and faults accumulated over past lives and present existence. With utmost sincerity, repent and prostrate a hundred times toward heaven. With wholehearted devotion, take refuge in the *Jade Emperor, Great Celestial Worthy* and the *August Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Heavens*. Make vows, counting each day as a year: swear to sever the three poisons and the ten evils, and vow to cultivate the one thousand three hundred virtues. Thus may one gradually enter the immortal lineage and, step by step, ascend the celestial path. You should transmit these teachings in succession and diligently practice them. The Dao is compassionate and responds to the sincerity of the heart. Repentance dissolves transgressions; cultivation generates blessings. Now, therefore, take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\nWith devoted heart, prostrate and pay homage to the *Most High of the Boundless Heaven of Mi Luo*.\nIn the wondrous realm of Mysterious Perfection, the distant Purple Gold Palace,\nThe Jade Pure Palace of the Grand Tenuity, the peerless and supreme Sage,\nRadiant beyond the void, serene and vast without origin,\nEncompassing the ten directions, the tranquil and constant Dao.\nThe vast and boundless, the wondrously potent *Jade Emperor, Great Celestial Worthy* and the *August Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Heavens*.\n\nTen prostrations.\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is first: killing. Endowed with a cruel nature, we indulge in slaughter, inflict brutal punishments, harm beings, and injure life. We shoot flying birds, pursue running beasts, overturn nests and uproot hibernating creatures, scald with boiling water and burn with fire, abort fetuses and destroy eggs, provide for our mouths and bellies, flatter and sacrifice to evil spirits, plot murder, incite murder, commit murder intentionally or by mistake. Revolving in the cycle of rebirth, we mutually harm one another. From this day forth, we repent and humbly seek forgiveness. May we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Compassionate Salvation and forever sever the karma of killing. May our ancestors be delivered and forever escape the retribution of hanging upside down and being butchered. May we, your disciples, receive grace and, in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruit of long life and enduring vision. May form and spirit both be wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Now, therefore, we take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\n*Jade Edict*—as before, ten prostrations.\n\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is second: stealing. Harboring deceit and scheming, we pilfer and break in, betray the public for private gain, deceive openly and cheat in secret. We steal from parents, from the sovereign, from the Three Treasures, from the five clans, ever increasing without restraint, ever ignorant and foolish. We encroach, plunder, and rob, heedless of gratitude or righteousness, unafraid of divine judgment, unmoved by the distress of those we harm, rejoicing only in what we gain. From this day forth, we repent and humbly seek absolution. May we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Integrity and Frugality and forever sever the karma of stealing. May our ancestors be delivered and forever escape the retribution of golden hammers and iron staves. May we, your disciples, receive grace and, in heaven and on earth, attain the blessed fruit of honor and prosperity. May form and spirit both be wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth. Now, therefore, we take refuge and prostrate with utmost devotion.\n\n*Jade Edict*—ten prostrations.\n\nWe, your disciples, with utmost devotion, take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, prostrate a hundred times toward heaven, and repent with utmost sincerity.\n\nAgain, we reflect that since former lives down to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the body’s karma is third: sexual misconduct. Our natures are impure, our passions frivolous; we indulge in lust and crave desire, harbor love and hatred, jealousy and envy, defile and disrupt the rites and scriptures, disregard kinship and propriety, willfully violate prohibitions and precepts. We entertain lewd thoughts and fantasies, exhausting our qi and deranging our spirits, indulging recklessly in ignorance, seeking pleasure without restraint, seducing and tempting all, baring ourselves before the Three Luminaries.",

May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of scorching, searing, and charring. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of fortune, emolument, longevity, and peace. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, the disciples, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, bowing a hundred times toward heaven, repenting with a single heart.\n\nWe reflect again: from past lives to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is third: frivolous speech. Our words transgress ritual and law, our conduct drifts into levity. We display obsequious charm, adorn our voices with ornate melody, utter lewd and profane words, embellish amorous sentiments. Our coquettish songs and melodies arouse impure thoughts in others, turning white to black, suppressing right to wrong. Our embroidered, deceptive words delude the foolish and mislead the credulous. Unaware, we darken our hidden virtue, accumulating boundless, measureless transgressions. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.\n\nMay we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Praise and forever sever the karma of frivolous speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of cauldrons, boiling water, and burning coals. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of ascending to the rank of superior immortals. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with utmost sincerity.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nWe, the disciples, with utmost sincerity take refuge in the divine, take refuge in the body, take refuge in life, bowing a hundred times toward heaven, repenting with a single heart.\n\nWe reflect again: from past lives to this present existence, the karma of the three poisons runs deep, and the obstacles of the ten evils weigh heavily. The great transgression of the mouth’s karma is fourth: false speech. We transgress ritual with embellished words, wield deceitful tongues with impure hearts. We fail to honor rulers, fathers, teachers, and friends; we fail to revere heaven, earth, and the divine. We fabricate groundless tales, deceive one another, incite unrest, shield faults and suppress virtues. We scheme with cunning, make falsehood our norm, swear oaths to implicate others, deceive ourselves in our innermost hearts. We curse to seek vindication, heedless of the unseen realm. We flaunt vanity, harbor suspicions, distort truth, and despise the teachings of sages and the scriptures of the great Dao, neglecting to recite and uphold them, instead slandering and disparaging them. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.\n\nMay we, together with all sentient beings, enter the Gate of Sudden Awakening and forever sever the karma of false speech. May our ancestors be delivered, forever spared the retribution of having our tongues plowed and intestines pierced. May we, the disciples, receive grace—whether in heaven or among men—attaining the blessed fruit of returning to our original, natural state. May our form and spirit both attain perfection, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nThus do we now take refuge, prostrating with sincere devotion.\n*Jade Decree: Ten Bows*\n\nAt that time, the Preceptor addressed the immortal disciples studying the Dao: \"When dwelling in the dust of the mundane world, every action becomes a transgression—boundless and measureless, difficult to recount, impossible to exhaust. Having bowed a hundred times toward heaven, we have fully confessed. The ten great evils of the mouth’s karma have now been entirely laid bare. With a single thought of reform, we instantly return to purity, like a bright mirror obscured by dust. Should it chance upon a skilled craftsman who polishes it with medicine and washing, the dust is removed, and its radiance restored. The extinction of sin and the arising of blessing are likewise.\n\nThe sagely immortals who established the teachings in the heavens constantly exhort the people of the world to diligently cultivate repentance. *Repentance* means not daring to conceal past faults; *remorse* means never again committing former wrongs. Having verbally confessed, the body bows and kneels; the heart must feel remorse and resolve to reform and turn toward goodness. Then, ten celestial deities of goodness will jointly protect and recommend us, and the immortals of the three realms will together guard and support us.\n\nShould one remain heedless and unrepentant, refusing to confess or reform, sinful roots will gradually entangle, deepening day by day. Then, the bureaus of yin and yang will examine and judge the malevolent and perverse; ghostly and demonic forces will assail, illnesses will not heal, disasters will arise in succession, public and private affairs will stagnate, and demonic obstacles will multiply.\n\nIf, in future lives, people encounter this Dao and cultivate it, they will move the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Bureaus, and the Four Departments to observe their sincerity and diligence, record their merits, and pardon their transgressions. Illnesses will be cured, Daoist practices will succeed, officials will be promoted, prisoners will be freed, and no suffering or hardship will befall them. Longevity will be extended, body and mind will be at peace. If repentance is performed for the deceased, their sins will be expunged upon retrospective cultivation, their dark records erased, and their souls will ascend to the Purple Palace.\n\nIn times of famine, drought, flood, locusts, pestilence, war, or plunder, if one follows the prescribed rites and performs repentance to dispel calamities, the land will be pacified, and the people and all beings will flourish. If a woman struggles in childbirth or is troubled by ghostly apparitions and domestic misfortune, by maintaining incense offerings and performing repentance with prayers, mother and child will be safe, and the household will be tranquil.\n\nIf one constantly practices repentance and rites, studies the Dao and attains it, seeks immortality and achieves it. If one performs repentance for specific matters and wishes, whatever is sought will be fulfilled—whether in heaven or among men, in future lives or this present existence—attaining boundless blessings. The fruition of enlightenment is no empty promise.\n\nThus did the Preceptor abandon his office to refine himself, inheriting and continuing the immortal lineage. In the eighth month of the first year of Zhengshi, he ascended by imperial decree at Yangping Mountain. This true teaching is transmitted to later generations. Those with affinity will meet it, attaining self-deliverance and delivering others. May all sentient beings together reach blessed felicity.\n\nWe bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Supreme, Most High, Perfect, and True Three Treasures.\"\n\nThe *Tai Shang Zheng Yi Chao Tian San Ba Xie Zui Fa Chan* is now complete.",
      "overlap_context": " venomous voices offend the true spirits. We harass and disturb the people, intimidate and bully the gentle and weak, are insolent and disrespectful toward elders, humiliate and insult common folk.

We forge widespread enmity, wantonly heap defilement and disgrace. From this day forth, we repent and pray for absolution.",
