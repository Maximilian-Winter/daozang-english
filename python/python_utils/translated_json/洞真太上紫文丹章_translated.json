After ninety days of purification rites, facing north, one shall swear the Nine Heavens’ covenant before transmission.

To transgress is to invite the departure of the divine and the approach of demons, to face trial and lose transcendence.\n\nWhen bearing the Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters—whether entering, exiting, resting, or practicing the Dao—one must first visualize one’s body enveloped in purple radiance, the Mysterious covering above, *qi* encircling the self.
