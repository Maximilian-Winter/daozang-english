There is no dharma of purity or defilement, no dharma of arising or ceasing. In this exhaustion, there is also nothing exhausted; all is ultimately empty, and emptiness ascends into the mysterious.\n\nWhy is this so? Internal perception is named the contemplation of the emptiness of objects. This emptiness is also empty; the emptiness of emptiness is also empty, for emptiness is without distinction. This emptiness without distinction is likewise empty, and emptiness is non-dual—thus it is said to be exhausted.\n\nIf good men and women illumine the empty nature of dharmas, without the mind of arising or ceasing, without the mind of arrogance or pride, without the mind of fear or dread, without the mind of hatred or attachment, they can be freed from all suffering in the world: the suffering of separation in birth and death, the suffering of harm by ghosts and spirits, the suffering of disputes in public and private affairs, the suffering of water, fire, blades, weapons, hunger, and cold—all are avoided and departed from.\n\nSuch exhaustive benefits are not for one or two persons, but for immeasurable, boundless, innumerable beings; not for one or two days, but for immeasurable, boundless, innumerable kalpas. Their merit and power are inconceivable.\n\nTherefore, this teaching is called liberation, the meaning of benefit, the meaning of boundlessness, the supreme meaning. All such meanings, whether inscribed, copied, read, recited, or expounded, constitute entering the gate of wisdom, wandering the chamber of wisdom, sitting upon the seat of wisdom, partaking of the food of wisdom, and attaining the essence of the true mark of wisdom.\n\nAt that time, the verse of wisdom was proclaimed:\n\nWisdom arises from the originless,\nLuminously illuminating the ten directions.\nKnotting emptiness to tower in the mysterious heavens,\nThe gods draw from its flowing fragrance.\nIts wonder is unfathomable,\nVacuity and resonance truly interpenetrate.\nBeing is non-being, being is not being;\nNon-being is non-being, non-being is not non-being.\nWisdom constantly contemplates the body—\nThe first task of those who cultivate the Dao.\nVastly entering the mysterious ford,\nNaturally recording my spirit.\nThe Heavenly Worthy ever protects,\nWhile demon kings guard the precious words.\nResplendent is the vajra body,\nTranscending the Supreme Immortals.\n\nWisdom engenders the root of precepts;\nIn the true Dao, precepts are the master.\nFrom this arise the Three Treasures,\nRevered and received by lofty immortals.\nRiding this deathless boat,\nSwiftly crossing the great expanse.\nWhen these precepts are proclaimed,\nThe gods come to bow in reverence.\n\n**Here ends *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Sutra of Wisdom in Contemplating the Body*.**",
