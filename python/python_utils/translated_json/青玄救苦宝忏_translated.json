they had **slain the victim themselves**.\nSome **deliberately scheme to murder others**,\nNot in accordance with **heavenly fate**.\n\nThey **forsake forgiveness and grudges**,\nAnd **yield to their own desires**.\nThey **accept bribes and perjury**,\nAnd **enter into falsehoods** with ease.\n\nThey **drown, strangle, or suffocate** others in their schemes,\nAnd **endure with cold-hearted cruelty**.\nThey **consume flesh and sleep upon skins**,\nYet **feel no remorse**.\n\nSuch **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.\nNow, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.\nWe **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,\nDelivering our **deceased soul**.\n\nHell’s torments know no sound of

Saint**.\nWe **recollect with grief** the **departed soul** of [name],\nFrom **conception to its fall into ruin**,\n**Accumulating sins of deceit and falsehood**, **never fully confessed**.\n\nSome **flatter with cunning words** before **lords and parents**,\n**Harming principle and propriety**—**most unfit**.\nSome **concoct secret plots** to **betray the virtuous and innocent**,\n**Deceiving even their own hearts**—**their guilt is profound**.\n\nIn **friendship’s exchange**, they **lack sincerity**,\nAnd **invoke the gods in oaths**—**yet their words are hollow**.\nThey **adorn speech and feign conduct**, **making trust impossible**,\n**Smiling to faces yet contradicting in truth**—**truly despicable**.\n\nSuch **guilt and retribution** are **boundless and without end**.\nNow, we **stand before the Dao**, with **devout hearts**, **confess our faults**.\nWe **earnestly pray** that the **sacred mandates** be **bestowed and fulfilled**,\nDelivering our **deceased soul**.\n\nIn

**ride in carriages with haughty bearing**,\nStill **clutching at injustice**—**their hearts remain unlevel**.\nSome **regard earth and wood** with **contemptuous disregard**,\n**Dismissing truth itself**—**they truly incur blame**.\n\nWe **despise** nobles and ministers, **treating them as common folk**;\nWe **see** kin and flesh, **yet act as if they were strangers**.\nTo **venerable sages and elders**, we **barely bow**—**one gesture is too much**;\nTo **vulgar fools and mediocre masses**, we **hold affection in our hearts**.\n\nSuch **sins and transgressions** are **boundless and
