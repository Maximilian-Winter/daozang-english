  "full_translation": "**The Fifteen Treatises of the Daoist Teachings Established on Double-Ninth Festival**\n\n**First Treatise: Dwelling in the Hermitage**\nAll who take the path of leaving the home must first seek refuge in a hermitage.\nA hermitage is a dwelling—one’s very self leans upon it.\nWhen the body has its resting place, the mind gradually finds peace.\nWith **qi** and spirit harmonious and unobstructed, one attains the true Dao.\n\nAll actions must not be excessive; excess drains **qi**.\nNor must one be entirely inactive—for then **qi** and blood stagnate.\nOne must balance movement and stillness within moderation,\nOnly then can one maintain steadfast tranquility.\nThis is the way of dwelling in the hermitage.\n\n---\n\n**Second Treatise: Wandering in the Clouds**\nThere are two kinds of wandering in the Dao:\nOne is to gaze upon mountains and waters of clarity and splendor,\nOr to admire the crimson and verdant hues of flowers and trees.\nSome revel in the bustling opulence of prefectures,\nSome marvel at the pavilions and halls of temples and observatories;\nSome seek friends to indulge their whims,\nSome linger for food and clothing.\nSuch people, though they traverse ten thousand miles,\nExhaust their bodies and weary their spirits,\nSearching far and wide for the wonders of the world—\nYet their minds are scattered, their **qi** diminished.\nThese are but hollow wanderers in the clouds.\n\nThe second kind is to probe the nature of life and death,\nTo seek the wondrous and profound mysteries.\nAscend perilous heights to visit tireless masters of renown,\nCross turbulent waters to question the Dao without satiety.\nIf but one phrase resonates, a radiant illumination arises within.\nUnderstanding the great matter of birth and death,\nOne becomes a man of perfect fulfillment.\nSuch people are true wanderers in the clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Third Treatise: Studying the Classics**\nThe way of studying the Classics must not be to chase after words and lose one’s focus.\nInstead, one should extract meaning to align with the heart,\nAbandon the text to delve into its essence and grasp its principles.\nWhen reason and essence are harmonized, and delight is found,\nThen one may truly absorb it into the mind.\nWith prolonged sincerity, the heart’s light naturally overflows,\nAnd the spirit’s wisdom leaps forth—\nNothing remains unpenetrated, nothing unsolved.\nIf one reaches this stage, one may cultivate and refine,\nBut must not indulge in reckless pursuits,\nLest one lose the path of life and death.\nIf one does not exhaust the true intent of the Classics,\nBut merely seeks to memorize and recite extensively,\nDiscussing with others to astonish the learned and clever—\nThis profits nothing in one’s practice,\nAnd harms the spirit’s vitality.\nThough one reads many books, what benefit does it bring to the Dao?\nOnce the meaning of the Classics is attained,\nOne should keep it deeply hidden.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Treatise: Alchemy and Medicine**\nMedicine is the refined **qi** of mountains and rivers,\nThe essence of grasses and trees.\nIt can warm or cool, supplement or purge;\nIt can surface or support.\nThe skilled alchemist nurtures life’s vitality,\nWhile the mediocre physician harms the body’s form.\nThose who study the Dao must not fail to understand medicine.\nIf one does not understand it, one cannot aid the Dao.\nNor must one cling rigidly—\nFor then one risks harming one’s **yin** cultivation.\nGreed for external wealth depletes the inner treasury of truth.\nThis is not merely a sin in this life,\nBut a warning against retribution in the next.\nMy esteemed disciples, carefully ponder these words.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Treatise: Building the Hermitage**\nA thatched hut or simple dwelling must suffice to shelter the body;\nSleeping under the open sky or in the wilderness risks exposure to the sun and moon.\nIf one constructs ornate beams and towering halls,\nThis is not the deed of a noble seeker.\nGrand palaces and lofty chambers—\nAre these the livelihood of one who follows the Dao?\nFelling trees disrupts the earth’s vital currents,\nAnd hoarding wealth from alchemical arts consumes the blood and **qi** of others.\nOnly external cultivation is pursued,\nWhile inner refinement is neglected—\nLike drawing a cake to satisfy hunger,\nOr piling snow to store as grain—\nAll labor in vain, leading to emptiness.\nThose with true resolve should seek the palace within their own body,\nAnd the vermilion towers of their flesh.\nIf one does not understand how to refine it,\nOne will see it crumble piece by piece.\nThe wise and discerning must carefully observe this.\n\n**Tenth Discourse: Harmonizing the Five Qi**\nThe Five Qi converge in the central palace,\nThe Three Primordials gather at the crown.\nThe Azure Dragon exhales crimson mist,\nThe White Tiger emits black smoke.\nTen thousand deities arrayed,\nWhite veins surge upward.\nCinnabar glows luminous, lead and mercury congeal pure.\nThough the body dwells among mortals,\nThe spirit already roams the heavens.\n\n**Eleventh Discourse: Merging Essence and Qi**\nEssence is spirit, qi is vitality.\nWhen essence meets qi,\nIt is like birds catching the wind—\nLightly ascending, effortless, swiftly accomplished.\nAs the *Yin Symbol Classic* states: *\"To seize it lies in controlling the qi.\"*\nThose cultivating the True Way must ponder this deeply.\nDo not reveal it to the unworthy,\nLest divine retribution descend.\nEssence and qi are the foundation of cultivation—\nGuard them closely and forge them diligently.\n\n**Twelfth Discourse: The Path of the Sage**\nTo enter the Sage’s Way,\nOne must endure hardship for years,\nAccumulating merit and practice.\nOnly the enlightened and virtuous\nMay tread this path.\nThough confined to a single chamber,\nThe essence fills the cosmos.\nAll heavenly sages silently protect;\nThe Boundless Immortal Lord subtly surrounds.\nOne’s name is recorded in the Purple Bureaus,\nOne’s rank stands among the celestial tiers.\nThough the form lingers in dust,\nThe mind transcends the mundane.\n\n**Thirteenth Discourse: Transcending the Three Realms**\nThe realms of desire, form, and formlessness—\nThese are the Three Realms.\nWhen the mind forgets deliberation,\nIt transcends the realm of desire.\nWhen the mind forgets all phenomena,\nIt transcends the realm of form.\nWhen the mind clings to void perception,\nIt transcends the formless realm.\nBeyond these three,\nThe spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages,\nAnd essence attains the realm of Jade Purity.\n\n**Fourteenth Discourse: Nourishing the Body**\nThe *Dharmakāya* is formless essence—\nNeither empty nor possessed,\nNeither bound nor free,\nNeither low nor high,\nNeither short nor long.\nWhen applied, it permeates all;\nWhen stored, it lies dormant and undetectable.\nIf one attains this Way,\nIt may be properly nourished.\nThe more it is cultivated, the greater the merit;\nThe less it is tended, the lesser the gain.\nDo not cling to return,\nNor to the world—\nDeparture and abiding come naturally.\n\n**Fifteenth Discourse: Severing the Mundane**\nTo sever the mundane is not to abandon the body,\nBut to purify the mind.\nThe body is like a lotus root,\nThe mind like its flower—\nRooted in mud yet blooming in empty space.\nThose who attain the Way\nDwell in the mundane while their essence soars in the sacred.\nToday’s seekers, desiring immortality and severance from the mundane,\nAre greatly deluded, failing to grasp the truth.\nThe Fifteenth Discourse warns those with resolve in the Gate:\nExamine this deeply and know it well.",

      "original_text": "重阳立教十五论 第一住庵 凡出家者，先须投庵。 庵者舍也，一身依倚，身有依倚，心渐得安。 炁神和畅，人真道矣。 凡有动作，不可过劳，过劳则损气;不可不动，不动则气血凝滞。 须要动静得其中，然后可以守常安分。 此是住庵之法。 第二云游 凡游历之道有二:一者看山水明秀，花木之红翠。 或玩州府之繁华，或赏寺观之楼阁，或寻朋友以纵意，或为衣食而留心。 如此之人，虽然万里之途，劳形费力，遍觅天下之景，心乱气衰，此乃虚云游之人。 二者参寻性命，求问妙玄。 登险之高山，访名师之不倦;度喧轰之运水，问道无厌。 若一句相投，便有圆光内发。 了生死之大事，作全其之丈夫。 如此之人，乃真云游也。 第三学书 学书之道，不可寻文而乱目。 当宜采意以合心，舍书探意采理。 合理采趣，来得趣则可以收入之心。 久久精诚，自然心光洋溢，智神踊跃，无所不通，无所不解。 若到此则可以收养，不可驰骋耳，恐失于性命。 若不穷书之本意，只欲记多念广。 人前谈说，垮讶才俊。 无益于修行，有伤于神气。 虽多看书，与道何益。 既得书意，可深藏之。 第四论合药 药者乃山川之秀气，草木之精华。 一温一寒，可补可泻； 一厚一薄，可表可托。 肯精学者，活人之性命； 若庸医者，损人之形体。 学道之人，不可不通。 若不通者，无以助道。 不可执着，则有损于阴功。 外贪财货，内费修真。 不足今生招愆，切忌来生之报。 吾门高弟，仔细参详。 第五论盖造 茅庵划舍，须要遮形，露宿野眠，触犯日月。 苟或雕梁峻宇，亦非上士之作为； 大殿高堂，岂是道人之活计。 斫伐树木，断地脉之津液化道货财，取人家之血脉。 只修外功，不修内行，如画饼充饥，积雪为粮，虚劳众力，到了成空。 有志之人，早当觅身中宝殿，体外朱楼。 不解修完，看看倒塌。 聪明君子，细细察详。 第六论合道伴 道人合伴，本欲疾病相扶，你死我埋，我死你埋。 然先择人，而后合伴。 不可先合伴，而后择人。 不可相恋，相恋则系其心； 不可不恋，不恋则情相离。 恋欲不恋，得其中道可矣。 有三合三不合：明心，有慧，有志，此三合也。 不明、着外境，无智慧、性愚浊，无志气、干打关，此三不合也。 立身之本，在丛林合凭心志。 不可顺人情，不可取相貌。 唯择高明者，不上法也。 第七论打坐 凡打坐者，非言形体端然、瞑目合眼，此是假打坐也。 真坐者，须要十二时辰，行住坐卧，一切动静中间，心如泰山，不动不摇，把断四门眼、耳、口、鼻，不令外景入内。 但有丝毫动静思念，即不名静坐。 能如此者，虽身处于尘世，名已列于仙位。 不须远参他人，便是身内贤圣。 百年功满，脱壳登真。 一粒丹成，神游八表。 第八论降心 凡论心之道，若常湛然，其心不动。 昏昏默默，不见万物； 冥冥杳杳，不内不外。 无丝毫念想，此是定心，不可降也。 若随境生心，颠颠倒倒，寻头觅尾，此名乱心也。 速当剪除，不可纵放，败坏道德，损失性命。 行动坐卧常勤降，闻见知觉为病患矣。 第九论炼性 理性如调琴，弦紧便有断，慢则不应，紧慢得中，琴可调矣。 则又如铸剑，钢多则折，锡多则卷，钢锡得中，则剑可矣。 调炼性者，体此二法，则自妙也。",
