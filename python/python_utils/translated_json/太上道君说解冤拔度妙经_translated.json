One fascicle.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Dongxuan Section, Category of Original Texts.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Supreme Dao Lord, together with the assembly of sacred beings, was seated beneath the Eight Auspicious Grove, within the Seven-Treasure Terrace. Arrayed in majestic dignity, they expounded the essentials of the Dao. Serene in spirit, they sat in silent meditation, like the Jade Capital Mountain. Radiating the nine-colored luminous brilliance of the mountain, the light shone upon the Hell of Blessed Halls. There, within the Blessed Halls, men and women of good karma dwelled in joy and effortless ease, carefree and at liberty. Yet again, they beheld the multitudes of hells, where hungry ghosts and destitute souls endured ceaseless suffering day and night. Devoid of human form, their five limbs rotted away; starving, they fed on raging flames; parched, they drank molten bronze. Their feet trod upon knife mountains, their bodies bore iron staves, their entire frames streamed with blood, and their wails pierced the heavens.\n\nAt that moment, a perfected one in the assembly, named Guangxin, rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and stepped forward. He addressed the Dao Lord, saying: \"I humbly inquire—what transgressions did these destitute souls commit in life to endure such torment?\"\n\nThe Dao Lord replied: \"Those who suffer these punishments, in their earthly existence, disrespected the Three Luminaries, defied divine principles, committed the ten evils and five rebellions, were disloyal and unkind, unfilial and uncompassionate, harmed living beings, and slaughtered sentient creatures. When their blessings were exhausted and their lifespans ended, they were condemned to this suffering.\"\n\nThen, the Perfected One Guangxin, moved by compassion, desired to deliver them. He entreated the Dao Lord’s wondrous power and majestic light to permit their salvation. Humbly, he awaited the Dao Lord’s golden words, that the essential Dharma might be broadly established. For the sake of all beings, the Dao Lord expounded this scripture, titled *Resolving Grievances and Removing Sins*, to circulate in the world and benefit both the living and the dead.\n\n\"If there are good men and good women who, with single-minded devotion, enter stillness, observe purity, burn incense, and practice the Dao, reciting this scripture at the six periods of the day, I shall, in accordance with their vows, protect and bless them. Their karmic grievances from past lives shall be dissolved by blessings, and the suffering souls in darkness shall each attain liberation and ascent.\"\n\nThe Perfected One Guangxin, overjoyed, bowed again and extolled the boundless causes, chanting in verse:\n\n*How mighty is the Great Dao Lord,*\n*Whose boundless merit ever abounds.*\n*Like a vessel crossing the sea of birth and death,*\n*Delivering souls beyond the Fengdu hells.*\n*No longer shall they meet their karmic foes,*\n*For blessings bridge the living and the dead.*\n*Who can fathom the workings of the divine?*\n*Who can exhaust the praise of such grace?*\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One Guangxin and the assembly of sacred beings, having heard the Dharma to its conclusion, each bowed in reverence, took refuge, and received the teachings with faith, vowing to uphold them.\n\n**Here ends *The Supreme Dao Lord’s Sublime Scripture on Resolving Grievances and Delivering Souls*.**",
