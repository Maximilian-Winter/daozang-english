  "full_translation": "**The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Title:** *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing*\n**Author:** Lin Xiyi of the Song Dynasty (宋林希逸注)\n**Volume:** Four scrolls\n**Source Edition:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) Section, *Yujue* (玉诀) Category\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed Song Edition (hereafter, *Shadow Song Edition*)\n2. *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed Japanese Kan'ei 4th Year Edition (hereafter, *Shadow Japanese Edition*)\n\n---\n\n**The Opening Explanation of the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Master Laozi bore the surname Li (李氏), given name Er (耳), and courtesy name Boyang (伯阳). Because his ears were large and unrefined (漫无轮), he was thus nicknamed Dan (聃). He was a native of Ku County (苦县) in Chu (楚国).\n\nHe served the Zhou dynasty as the Keeper of the Archives (藏室史). During the reign of King Jing of Zhou (周景王), when Confucius was thirty years old, he once inquired about rites from Laozi when he was visiting. Their exchanges are frequently recorded in *The Book of Rites* (礼记). Confucius was of an earlier generation, and it is said: *\"He merely transmits but does not create—he compares himself to me, to Laozi and Pengzu.\"* The Grand Historian Sima Qian also noted that Confucius revered Laozi, and this was not an exaggeration.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ passing, there was a Zhou court historian named Xian (檐), who once appeared before Duke Xian of Qin (秦献公) and spoke of the cycles of separation and union. Some claim that this Xian was Laozi, but this is incorrect. Xian (檐) and Laozi (老子) share the same pronunciation, and the error arose from transmission.\n\nWhen the Zhou dynasty declined, Laozi traveled westward. As he approached the Sanmen Pass (散关), the Pass Warden, Yin Xi (尹喜), recognizing him as an extraordinary figure, insisted that he record his teachings. Laozi then composed the *Dao De Jing* in two sections, totaling over five thousand words, before departing.\n\nThough these two sections contain chapters, they resemble the *Xici* (系辞) in structure—upper and lower parts. However, the Master of the Yellow River (河上公) divided it into eighty-one chapters, stating that the upper section follows Heaven (法天), whose number is odd, containing thirty-seven chapters; the lower section follows Earth (法地), whose number is even, containing forty-four chapters. Yan Zhen (严遵) further divided it into seventy-two, stating that eight chapters belong to the Yin (阴) Dao and nine to the Yang (阳) Dao, multiplying eight by nine to yield seventy-two. The upper section thus contains forty chapters, and the lower thirty-two. These divisions were not the original intent, nor were the chapter titles that followed.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong (元宗) revised the chapter divisions, assigning the upper section to the Dao (言道) and the lower to virtue (言德), which was also incorrect.\n\nThe transmitted editions vary greatly, and sometimes a single differing character alters the entire meaning of a chapter. Discerning the true intent becomes even more difficult.\n\nIn general, Laozi’s teachings use material things to elucidate the Dao, often adapting to the customs and inclinations of his time. Yet readers fail to grasp his intent, leading Master Hui (晦翁) to criticize Laozi as overly verbose, while Master Xi Shan (西山) accused him of harboring hidden agendas. Since this text is revered by Daoists, their excessive veneration leads to extravagant interpretations, failing to clarify its true meaning. Meanwhile, Confucian scholars dismiss it as heterodox, seizing upon flaws to condemn it without deeper examination. Though many commentaries exist, they all suffer from these shortcomings.\n\nOnly Master Yingbin (颖滨) has illuminated its meaning, coming close to the truth, yet his explanations of phrasing and textual flow remain incomplete, and many passages still pose difficulties. Moreover, he claims that Laozi’s work aligns with Buddhist scriptures, which is incorrect. Though Zhuangzi followed Laozi’s teachings, his words differ fundamentally from Laozi’s own. Zhuangzi’s *Autobiography* centers on life and death, as seen in *The Book of the World* (天下篇), which is why his ideas often converge with Buddhist thought. However, Laozi’s principles—such as *\"acting without doing, thus transforming\"* and *\"not contending, yet achieving victory\"*—do not contradict our own texts. Their differences stem only from his rhetorical exaggerations to correct societal excesses, occasionally going too far.\n\nMaster Yichuan (伊川) said: *\"The chapter ‘Guishing’ (谷神) is Laozi’s finest.\"* Thus, Master Wending (文定) remarked: *\"Laozi’s five thousand words are like his discussions on ‘I have no affairs,’ ‘I love tranquility,’ and ‘I possess the Three Treasures’—these are his most profound teachings.\"* Zhu Wen Gong (朱文公) also stated: *\"Emperor Wen of Han and Cao Can only grasped the superficial aspects of Laozi’s teachings; Wang Dao and Xie An never reached their essence.\"* He further said: *\"Bo Yi somewhat resembles Laozi.\"* And again: *\"The people of Jin and Song often discuss Zhuangzi and Laozi, yet they fail to grasp their true depths.\"*\n\nThus, even the earlier scholars did not entirely reject Laozi, but because his teachings often used metaphorical language interpreted as literal truth, they were sometimes criticized. This has long been an unresolved debate. If one were to investigate and uncover his original intent, one would truly understand Laozi’s meaning—encountering it as if it were revealed in the morning and evening.\n\nPrefaced by Lin Xiyi of Yongzhai (庸斋林希逸).\n\n---\n**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***\n\n**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nNameless, it marks the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without, to glimpse its subtlety;\nEver with, to perceive its manifestations.\n\nThese two—though issuing from the same source and bearing different names—are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious: the gateway through which all wonders emerge.\n\nThis chapter stands at the book’s beginning, its essence contained here.\nIts meaning holds that the Dao cannot truly be spoken—any utterance becomes a secondary expression.\n\"Ever\" signifies unchanging, immutable.\n\nWhat can be spoken and named is subject to change;\nWhat cannot be spoken or named is beyond change.\n\nWith names like *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), and *zhi* (wisdom), the benevolent cannot be righteous, the ritual cannot be wise.\nWith names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter, spring cannot be summer, autumn cannot be winter.\nThus, it is the *eternal Dao*, the *eternal Name*.\n\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth is the time before the *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity) divided;\nIn the human heart, it is the stillness, unmoving foundation.\nBefore the *Taiji* divided, how could there be names for spring, summer, autumn, and winter?\nIn stillness, unmoving, how could there be names for the seven virtues—*ren, yi, li, zhi*?\nThus, it is said: *Nameless, the origin of Heaven and Earth*.\n\nWhen speaking of Heaven and Earth, it is not merely Heaven and Earth—\nit is an analogy for the mind’s true nature.\nOnce names like *yin* and *yang* exist, all transformations arise from them;\nOnce names like *ren* and *yi* exist, all myriad paths begin here.\nThus, it is said: *Named, the mother of all things*.\n\"Mother\" signifies the source from which all things arise.\n\nThe two lines—*Ever without* and *Ever with*—are Laozi’s teaching on ultimate understanding.\nIn the world, all things are *with*, yet who knows this *with* originates from *without*?\nIf one insists on *without*, one risks the reckless void, inviting calamity.\nThus, those who study the Dao must, in moments of *without*, seek its ultimate truth—\nthen perceive the wonder of how *with* arises.\nAnd in moments of *with*, they must seek its ultimate truth—\nthen perceive its origin from *without*.\n\"Manifestations\" (*jiao*)—as in the *Rites of Zhou*—refers to the source from which all things emerge.\nThe two \"desire\" (*yu*) words hold deep meaning: *desire* here means *seek* to attain this ultimate understanding.\n\nThough *with* and *without* are two, though they bear different names, they share the same source.\nIf one constantly observes *without* and *with*, both are called the Mysterious—\nthe Mysterious being the marvel of transformation.\nThus viewed, Laozi’s teaching is not merely about empty nothingness.\nIf one were to insist solely on *without*, it would not say, *\"These two issue from the same source,\"*\nnor *\"Both are called the Mysterious.\"*\n*The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the gateway of all wonders*—\nthis is the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"There is a beginning, there is a non-beginning of beginning,\nthere is a non-beginning of the non-beginning of beginning.\"*\nYet it only praises its wonder—no other meaning exists.\nTo say one layer follows another is not its intent.\n*All wonders*—as in the *Yijing*: *\"The wondrous in all things.\"*\n*Gateway*—speaking of their origin.\nMany read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth,\nyet Laozi’s intent is to grasp it in the mind.\nOnly by viewing both together can one fully comprehend this book.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"Under Heaven All Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen evil already exists.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsound and voice harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nteaches without speech.\nAll things arise, yet he does not claim them;\nHe nurtures, yet does not possess;\nHe acts, yet does not rely on it;\nWhen his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.\nOnly because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him.\n\nThis chapter expounds the meaning of *having yet not dwelling*.\nThere is beauty, there is ugliness;\nThere is goodness, there is evil.\nIf one does not know beauty as beauty,\ndoes not know goodness as goodness,\nthen there is no ugliness, no evil.\n\nFor all things under Heaven,\nwhere there is *being*, there is *non-being*;\nwhere there is *difficulty*, there is *ease*;\nwhere there is *long*, there is *short*;\nwhere there is *high*, there is *low*;\nwhere there is *sound*, there is *voice*;\nwhere there is *before*, there is *after*.\nThe six lines below—*give rise to, complete, define, depend, harmonize, follow*—\nall illustrate the earlier meaning of beauty/ugliness and goodness/evil.\n\nThus, the Sage acts through *non-action*, speaks through *non-speech*—\nnot because he fears emptiness or busyness,\nbut because his work is done without dwelling upon it.\nLike Heaven and Earth nurturing all things,\nendlessly transforming without ceasing—\nhow could they claim the labor?\nAll things fill Heaven and Earth,\nyet Heaven and Earth do not claim possession.\nAs for *being spring, being summer, giving life, taking life*—\nhow does transformation rely on these as its power?\nThus, it is said: *Nurtures yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely on it*.\nIts intent lies solely in *when the work is done, not dwelling upon it*—\nhence, *\"All things arise, yet he does not claim them.\"*\nThe three lines elucidate this action,\nas the *Yijing* says: *\"Kun nurtures and completes all things.\"*\nThis is the meaning of Shun and Yu receiving the Mandate yet not claiming it.\nAll ancient Sages were thus—\nhow could Laozi alone be different?\nYet his words are too austere,\nmaking them seem like heterodox teachings.\n\n*\"Only because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him\"*—\nthose who possess *having* cannot truly have it,\nwhile those who do not possess *having* can truly possess it.\nThese eight characters are profound.\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Having virtue, they lose their virtue.\"*\nThis is the very meaning.\n\nThe *Chapter on \"Not Exalting the Virtuous\"*:\n\n*\"When sound forms into harmonious patterns, it is called music—\nhence, 'Music and sound harmonize together.'*\n\n**Third Chapter: Not Exalting the Virtuous**\nNot exalting the virtuous, so the people do not vie in contention;\nNot treasuring rare and difficult goods, so the people do not turn to thievery;\nNot displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered.\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties their hearts, fills their bellies,\nWeakens their ambitions, strengthens their bodies.\nEver keeps the people in ignorance and without desire—\nso that even the wise dare not act.\nIf one acts with *non-action* (無為),\nthen there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n*Exalting* is the same as *priding oneself*.\n\nIf I pride myself in virtue,\nthen contention will surely arise throughout the world.\nOnly Yu did not pride himself—\nand thus none in the world could vie with his governance.\nThis is the very intent.\n\nIf I treasure rare goods,\nthen all will have hearts desiring to obtain them,\nand their faults will lead to thievery.\nThese two lines elucidate the meaning of what follows—*not displaying what is desirable*.\nIf one does not show what is desirable,\nthen the heart will naturally settle.\n*Not displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered*—\nthese eight characters are most excellent.\n\n*Empties their hearts*: No thoughts of longing or admiration.\n*Fills their bellies*: Sated with food.\n*Weakens their ambitions*: No pursuit of competition.\n*Strengthens their bodies*: Nourishes their vitality.\nIt speaks of the Sages of antiquity—\nonly ensuring the people were well-fed,\nwithout other thoughts of longing or admiration,\ntheir strength robust yet without striving for competition,\nso their people remained pure and unspoiled,\nknowing nothing, desiring nothing.\nThough some among them had clever and contriving minds,\neven if knowledge sprouted within their hearts,\nthey dared not act upon it.\n\nThus the Sage governs the world in this way—\nand the Sage himself takes no pleasure in the world.\nHis governance is all through *non-action* (無為),\nand thus there is nothing that cannot be governed.\n\n*Not displaying what is desirable, so the hearts do not grow disordered*—\nthis describes how the Sage teaches his people.\n*Teaching*: instructing the people.\nNot exalting the virtuous, not treasuring rare goods—\nall these are to prevent stirring the hearts of desire.\nStirring the hearts of desire does not stop at these two matters,\nbut they are spoken of for brevity.\n\nLaozi lamented the turbulence of the latter ages,\nso he contemplated the tranquility of antiquity.\nHis words are not without excess,\nand thus they do not fully encompass our Sage’s teachings.\n\n**Fourth Chapter: The Dao/Way is Boundless**\nThe Dao/Way is boundless yet applied—\nsometimes it overflows, sometimes it does not.\nDeep and vast, it seems like the origin of all things.\nIt blunts their sharpness,\ndissolves their chaos,\nharmonizes their brilliance,\nunifies their dust,\nand is profound—\nseemingly as if it exists.\nI do not know whose child it is,\nyet it precedes the *Imperial Sovereign* (象帝之先).\n*Boundless*: the same as *empty*.\nThough the Dao/Way’s essence is empty,\nits application is inexhaustible.\nSometimes full, sometimes not—\nit adapts without fixed measure.\nIt does not say 'full or not full',\nbut 'sometimes it does not overflow',\nfor the word *sometimes* (或) reveals its meaning—\nthis is the art of composition.\n\n*Deep*: beautiful.\n*Seems*: employs a tentative phrase to praise it.\nThe origin of all things—\nthat is what Zhuangzi called the *Great Master of the Origin*.\nIt says this Dao/Way is like something that exists and does not exist—\nonly those who understand the Dao/Way know it,\nso it is said to seem like the origin of all things.\n*Blunts their sharpness*: it grinds them down, leaving no edges.\n*Dissolves their chaos*: amid turmoil, it remains orderly and composed.\n*Brilliance* yet not revealed—\nhence, *harmonizes their brilliance*.\n*Dust* yet not self-cleansing—\nhence, *unifies their dust*.\nThis is what the Buddhist scriptures call *neither defiled nor pure*.\n*Profound*: indistinct and invisible.\nSeemingly existing, seemingly nonexistent—\nvisible yet invisible, knowable yet unknowable—\nhence, *profound, it seems as if it exists*.\n*I do not know whose child it is*—\nalso employs a tentative phrase to praise it.\n*Imperial Sovereign*: the same as *Heaven*.\nIt says: *At the beginning of creation, it precedes the Sovereign*.\nThe phrases *seems* and *like* all describe\nwhat is visible yet invisible,\nknowable yet unknowable—\nthese words are used to depict its subtlety.\n\n**Fifth Chapter: Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue/Ren** (天地不仁)\n\n**Chapter Five: Heaven and Earth Lack Virtue/Ren** (天地不仁)\n\nThey treat all things as *straw-dogs*;\nThe Sage lacks virtue/Ren, treating the people as *straw-dogs*.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it like a *wallet-bellows*?\nEmpty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nBetter to hold fast to the *Central Way*.\nTo nurture life is virtue/Ren—\nThough Heaven and Earth nurture life, they do not claim it as merit,\nForgetting themselves in things.\nTo nourish the people is virtue/Ren—\nThough the Sage nourishes the people, he does not claim it as grace,\nForgetting himself in the people.\n*Not seven*—\nThis is because he lacks virtue/Ren.\n*Straw-dog*—\nUsed and then discarded, an illustration of mutual forgetting.\nChapter Thirty-Eight says:\n*The highest virtue lacks virtue*—\nThus it has virtue.\n*Lacking virtue* is akin to *lacking virtue*.\n*The Zhuangzi’s* *Qiwu* says:\n*The greatest virtue is not virtue*.\n*The Tian Di* says:\n*In the age of perfect virtue*, they love one another yet do not call it virtue.\nThis too carries the same meaning.\nThe *straw-dog*—\nWhen used in sacrifice, it is employed; once the sacrifice ends, it is cast aside.\nThis illustrates the idea of indifference and mutual forgetting.\nIn precise terms, it implies the intent of *transformation through excess*,\nthough some misinterpret it as treating the people like grass and chaff.\nGenerally, the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi\ndelight in shocking and defying conventional speech,\nso their words often contain flaws.\nThe essence of this chapter is simply:\nHeaven and Earth harbor no intention in nurturing life,\nThe Sage harbors no intention in nourishing the people.\nYet expressed in this way, it veers toward the strange,\nand readers who lack precision fall into deep error.\nThus it is said:\nThe harshness of Shen Buhai and Han Fei\noriginates from the idea of treating the people as *straw-dogs*,\nthough even Laozi cannot evade blame.\n\n*A wallet-bellows*—\nThe tube of the bellows; when used, wind arises.\nThough its form is empty, its use is unyielding—\nMove it, and wind emerges, ever more abundant.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, its nurturing of myriad things is thus.\nThe *wallet-bellows* does not harbor intent toward the wind—\nHeaven and Earth do not harbor intent toward nurturing life—\nHence the analogy.\nMoreover, when used, wind arises; when unused, it ceases—\nThis too carries the intent of *transformation through excess*.\n*Much speech*—\nMeaning repeated speech.\n*Holding fast to the Central Way*—\nSilently closing one’s mouth.\nMeaning:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be exhausted by words—\nMuch speech leads to self-exhaustion;\nBetter to remain silent and forget speech.\nThe Master said:\n*I wish to speak not at all—*\n*What can Heaven say?*\nThe four seasons proceed therein,\nAnd myriad things are born therein.\nThis too carries the same meaning.\nBut the Sage’s words are pure and easily understood,\nWhile this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.\nSome may take it as a warning against excessive speech,\nyet this contradicts the chapter’s intent.\nIf one sees through this,\nNot only does the beginning and end cohere within a single chapter,\nwith clear meaning,\nBut its language is concise, profound, and anciently elegant—\nHow could this be easily attained?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die** (谷神不死)\n\nThe *Valley Spirit* does not die—\nThis is called the *Dark Feminine*.\nThe *Dark Feminine’s Gate*—\nThis is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.\nEndless, as if it exists,\nUsed without exhaustion.\nThis chapter describes the practice of cultivation,\nthough Laozi’s original intent was not solely for cultivation.\n*Essence* is solid, *Spirit* is empty.\n*Valley*—emptiness.\n*The Valley Spirit*—the spirit within emptiness.\nSaying that the human spirit arises from emptiness,\nThus it constantly exists and does not die—\nMysterious and boundless.\n*Feminine*—empty yet not solid.\nThese two characters merely describe *emptiness*.\nHeaven and Earth also arise from this,\nHence called *Root*.\n*Endless*—unceasing and unbroken.\n*As if it exists*—\nNeither clearly present nor absent.\nUsed within emptiness, thus not labored yet ever-present—\nThis is the *empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant*.\nMaster Hui said:\n*The most subtle principle*\nHolds the intent of *generative generation*.\nThis phrase is fine,\nBut its meaning leans toward theories of life-nurturing.\nThough this chapter can be applied to life-nurturing,\nIts original intent was not solely focused on this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Durable** (天长地久)\n\nHeaven is long, Earth is durable.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nThey do not will their own generation,\nThus they endure in generation.\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,\nSets it aside yet it is preserved.\nIs this not because he is without selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\nThis chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s lack of intent.\nHeaven and Earth nurture myriad things naturally,\nWithout intent, thus enduring for ten thousand years as if but a day.\nThe Sage’s cultivation of his body\nLacks intent toward precedence or subsequence,\nLacks intent toward interior or exterior,\nThus nothing precedes him yet he constantly exists—\nTherefore, his lack of selfishness fulfills his selfishness.\nThis *selfishness* refers to the body,\nNot the selfishness of public and private.\nIf *selfishness* is taken as public-private selfishness,\nThen it cannot be said he lacks intent.\nThis phrase is also Laozi’s way of enticing people toward goodness,\nAnd the Buddhist later inverted it with phrases like *true emptiness, true existence*.\nThus *true emptiness* is the meaning of *lacking selfishness*,\n*True existence* is the meaning of *fulfilling selfishness*.\nBut when spoken of, it seems yet another layer higher.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Goodness Is Like Water** (上善若水)\n\nThe highest goodness is like water.\nWater benefits myriad things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people dislike—\nThus it approaches the Dao.\nResiding in goodness of place,\nHeart in goodness of depth,\nSpeech in goodness of kindness,\nAffairs in goodness of ability,\nActions in goodness of timing.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it has no blame.\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the lack of intent.\n*Highest goodness*—the utmost goodness,\nSaying that the supreme principle of the world aligns with water.\nWater’s goodness—\nIt benefits myriad things,\nYet never considers itself capable.\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Goodness Is Like Water (续)**\nFlowing without resistance—this is non-contention.\nDescending to lowliness, embracing dampness,\nIt does not take what others abhor as abhorrent.\nThus, observing water, one draws near the Dao.\n*\"Near\"* means *close*.\n\nResiding in goodness of place—dwelling there with ease.\nHeart in goodness of depth—its steadfastness and stillness.\nWith others in goodness of kindness—its benevolence extending to all.\nSpeech in goodness of truth—its words ever aligned with reality.\nGovernance in goodness of order—by it, the state is rectified.\nAffairs in goodness of ability—by it, no task remains unattended.\nActions in goodness of timing—moving with perfect season.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus none can blame it.\n\nThis is why it is said:\n*\"Only because you do not contend,\nNo one under heaven can contend with you.\"*\n\nMany interpreters mistakenly take these seven virtues as water’s highest goodness,\nThus their explanations are forced and stray from Laozi’s true intent.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: Holding Fullness (持而盈之)**\nHolding fullness to the brim,\nIt fares worse than if it had not been filled.\nSharpening to a point,\nIt cannot endure long.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey invite their own calamity.\nWhen deed is complete, name secured,\nWithdraw—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nThis chapter speaks only of retreat being better than advancement,\nUsing the metaphors of holding fullness and sharpening to a point.\nWhat is full must overflow—difficult to hold.\nBetter to avoid fullness than to struggle with it.\n*\"Already\"* means *\"do not fill.\"*\n\n*\"Describe\"* means *\"refine.\"* *\"Sharp\"* means *\"keen.\"*\nRefining a vessel to its utmost sharpness and keenness,\nNothing endures—better to remain unsharpened for lasting preservation.\nWealth reaching gold and jade in halls,\nCannot be long retained.\nAscending to noble rank yet growing arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves.\nThus those who preserve their merit and safeguard their name\nMust know when to withdraw early—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\n*\"Deed complete, name secured\"*—\nThis refers to those who, by greatness or smallness,\nCan preserve themselves—hence *\"complete\"* and *\"secured.\"*\nIf one does not know sufficiency,\nWhen is it ever complete?\nWhen is it ever secured?\nThese four characters must be pondered carefully.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten: Carrying the Vital Essence (载营魄)**\nCan you carry the vital essence and yet remain undivided?\nCan you focus your qi and attain supreme softness,\nLike an infant?\nCan you purify and observe the profound,\nYet remain without flaw?\nCan you govern the people and the state,\nYet act without doing?\nCan you open and close the celestial gates,\nYet remain without distinction?\nCan you be clear and all-encompassing,\nYet remain without knowing?\n\nTo nurture and rear—\nTo give birth yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely,\nTo grow yet not dominate—\nThis is called *profound virtue*.\n\n*\"Vital essence\"*—the soul, the spirit.\n*\"Arcane\"*—the essence, the qi.\nThese three characters hold Laozi’s deepest meaning.\n*\"Carrying\"* is like loading a vehicle—\nPlacing *\"vital essence\"* above while positioning *\"arcane\"* below,\nLike a riddle.\n\nIf the arcane carries the vital essence, it is the way of the common.\nIf the vital essence carries the arcane, it is the way of the sage.\nTogether, they form one;\nSeparated, they are two.\n*\"Embrace\"* means *\"unify.\"*\nIts intent is: Can you unify and make one, so as not to divide?\nOr will you separate and make two?\nThus it asks: *\"Can you embrace unity and remain undivided?\"*\nThese six characters hold profound, hidden meaning—\nOnly self-reflection and enlightenment can reveal them.\n\nAn infant, untainted by perception or hearing,\nThus its qi is focused.\n*\"Attain\"* means *\"push to the utmost.\"*\n*\"Softness\"* means *\"yielding.\"*\nIf one can, like an infant, focus the qi and embrace yielding,\nThen one can embrace unity—\nThus it asks: *\"Can you be like an infant?\"*\nThese are Laozi’s rhetorical questions,\nMeaning: *\"Can people truly do this?\"*\nThe following questions follow the same intent.\n\nTo purify and observe the profound mysteries,\nYet remain without distinction—\n*\"Without flaw\"* means *\"without differentiation.\"*\nThough impurities are cleansed, if the mind still clings to purity and defilement,\nThen one can embrace unity.\nTo love the people and govern the state,\nYet act with a *\"doing without doing\"* heart—\nThen one can embrace unity.\nThe opening and closing of yin and yang,\nThough governed by the interplay of male and female,\nIf the mind does not cling to such distinctions—\nThen one can embrace unity.\n*\"Celestial gates\"*—the natural principles between heaven and earth.\nThis is also a metaphor borrowed from creation.\nFrom such language, the cultivation schools arose,\nAnd some have perverted it, misleading many.\n\n*\"Clear and all-encompassing\"*—without obstruction.\nYet to regard *\"without knowing\"* as knowing—\nThis is to embrace unity.\n*\"To nurture and rear\"*—the creative process of nature nurturing all things.\nCreation does not regard them as its own,\nDoes not rely on them as its power.\nThough it is the sovereign of all things,\nIt never harbors a will to dominate—\nOnly then is it called *profound virtue*.\n\nThis chapter’s intent is largely about *\"doing without doing,\"*\nActing naturally.\nIf one acts without doing, the heart remains empty—\nThus the spirit carries the arcane, not the arcane the spirit.\nThis is the way of the sage.\nIf the arcane carries the spirit, it becomes entangled.\n\nLaozi’s entire work revolves around:\n*\"Being real yet empty, having yet without—*\nThis is the ultimate Way.\"\nWhether spoken directly or obliquely,\nIt never strays from this principle.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes (三十辐章)**\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Thirty Spokes (三十辐章)**\n---\n\nThe thirty spokes converge at a single hub,\nYet it is their emptiness that makes the carriage useful.\nMold clay into a vessel,\nYet it is their emptiness that makes the vessel useful.\nPierce doors and windows to make a dwelling,\nYet it is their emptiness that makes the dwelling useful.\nThus, *having* provides utility,\nBut *emptiness* provides function.\n\nThe hub is the axle’s core within the carriage,\nThe spokes’ foundation.\nBecause the hub is hollow within,\nOnly then can it bear the carriage.\n\nClay and mud—tools of the potter—\nAre hollow and round,\nThus they can form vessels.\n\nDoors and windows are the dwelling’s luminous passages.\nThese three things—\nAll use *emptiness* as their function,\nHence: *having* yields utility,\n*emptiness* yields use.\n\nCarriage, vessel, dwelling—\nAll are tangible utilities,\nYet their essence as carriage, dwelling, or vessel\nAll depend on the hollow’s function.\n\nWith this, the single character *wu* (無) is rendered in vivid form—\nA stroke of genius.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Five Colors (五色章)**\n---\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nExcessive hunting and chasing madden the mind,\nRare treasures corrupt conduct.\nThus the sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the former to embrace the latter.\n\n*Blindness*—the power to confuse vision.\n*Deafness*—the power to confuse hearing.\n*Dullness*—loss of true taste.\n*Madness*—instability of mind.\n*Corruption*—obstruction of virtue.\n\nThese five things\nAll stem from indulging externals while neglecting the inner self.\nThe belly is within,\nThe eyes are without.\nThe sage attends to the inner, not the outer,\nThus discards the former and embraces the latter.\n\n*Former*—the five excesses above.\n*Latter*—the Dao.\n\nLaozi’s chapters often conclude with piercing precision.\n*Indulging externals* is not limited to these five—\nA general principle for all to infer.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation (宠辱章)**\n---\n\nHonor and humiliation—like sudden shocks,\nTreating great calamity as one’s own body.\n\nWhat is meant by *honor and humiliation*?\nHonor is lowly—\nGaining it causes alarm,\nLosing it causes alarm.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nThe reason I have great calamity\nIs that I have a body.\nIf I had no body,\nWhat calamity would I have?\n\nThus, to value the body as the world,\nOne may entrust oneself to the world;\nTo love the body as the world,\nOne may commit oneself to the world.\n\n*If*—though—\nHonor and humiliation are not worth alarm,\nYet people alarm themselves.\nThe body is a great calamity,\nYet people value it.\n\nFirst, two phrases are raised,\nThen explained below.\n\n*What is meant*—\nNot worth speaking of.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: Honor and Humiliation (宠辱章)**\nHonor and humiliation are one and the same,\nA matter that, in truth, is not worth speaking of.\nYet people regard humiliation as lowly,\nAnd thus their hearts of good and evil arise.\nTherefore, both gaining and losing it\nCan agitate their minds—\nThis is the meaning of *fearing gain and loss*.\n\nThe body is my burden,\nWithout it, there would be no burden at all.\nYet people mistakenly value it,\nFor they do not know its true nature.\n\nTo know the true worth of the body,\nTo love the body as the world’s treasure,\nEven if one gains all under heaven,\nIt is not enough to exchange for it.\n\nIf people could grasp this,\nThey might entrust themselves to the world.\n\nThe words *entrust* and *commit* imply\nThat the world would not accept them.\nThis chapter’s two *What is meant* queries\nHold two distinct meanings—\nA subtle beauty of the ancient text.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Dao Beyond Form (视之不见章)**\nThat which cannot be seen is called *Yi*,\nThat which cannot be heard is called *Xi*,\nThat which cannot be grasped is called *Wei*.\nThese three cannot be summoned or questioned,\nSo they are merged into one.\n\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower depths are not dark.\nEndless, yet without name,\nIt returns to the formless void.\nThis is called the *form of no-form*,\nThe *image of no-image*—\nThis is *Hunhuang*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head,\nFollow it and you see no tail.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao,\nTo govern the present with the eternal.\nTo know the ancient beginning,\nThis is called *Dao Ji*.\n\nThis chapter describes the Dao’s lack of trace.\n*Yi* means *level/even*.\n*Xi* and *Wei* convey the idea of *invisibility*.\nInitially, the three terms are indistinct,\nAll depicting the Dao’s unseen, unheard, ungraspable nature.\n*Bó* means *to hold*.\nThe three—*Xi, Yi, Wei*—\nTheir names cannot be summoned or questioned,\nFor they are beyond distinction.\nThus, they are merged into one,\nFor they are all the Dao.\n\nThese two lines are Laozi’s own explanation of the three above,\nWhere Laozi says *cannot be summoned or questioned*,\nYet the commentator still distinguishes *Xi, Yi, Wei*.\nFollowing his reasoning, though constrained,\nThe flow of his words remains unbroken.\n\n*Not bright* means *not clear*,\n*Not dark* means *not obscure*.\n*Upper* and *lower* refer to *looking up and down*.\nThese two words should not be rigidly confined,\nBut simply convey that this Dao\nIs neither clear nor obscure,\nWhether sought above or below.\n\n*Endless, yet without name*—\nIts conclusion returns to nothingness,\nThus it is the *form of no-form*,\nThe *image of no-image*—\nThis is also *Hunhuang*.\n\nTo approach it and see no head,\nIs to say it has no beginning.\nTo follow it and see no tail,\nIs to say it has no end.\n\n*Hold fast to the ancient Dao*—\nIts origin was void, yet emerged from it.\nBy knowing its initial void,\nOne may govern the present with the eternal,\nAnd thus grasp the ancient Dao’s essence.\n\n*Ji* means *principle/standard*.\n*Dao Ji* is like saying *human principle*\nOr the *standard of the sovereign’s Way*.\nThis chapter portrays the ancient sage’s mastery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Virtue (古之善为士章)**\nThe ancient sage who mastered the Way\nWas subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nToo deep to be known.\n\nSince it cannot be known,\nHe feigned outward forms to describe it:\n*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter,\n*Jū* like one fearing four neighbors,\n*Yǎn* like a guest,\n*Huàn* like ice about to melt,\n*Dūn* like uncarved wood,\n*Kuàng* like an empty valley,\n*Hún* like muddy water.\n\nWho can make muddy water still,\nAnd slowly it becomes clear?\nWho can remain motionless for long,\nAnd slowly life emerges?\n\nHe who preserves this Dao\nDoes not seek fullness.\nBecause he does not seek fullness,\nHe can endure decay without renewal.\n\nThis chapter depicts one attuned to the Dao’s subtlety,\nDeep in its understanding,\nYet without revealing what he knows.\n\nHis outward appearance comes from *wu xin*—\nA void so profound that knowledge cannot grasp it,\nThus his forms seem effortless.\n*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter—\nThe difficulty of traversing.\n*Yu* also means *leisurely*, *hesitant*.\n*Jū* means *hesitant*, *like one fearing four neighbors*,\nWho dares not act freely.\n*Guest* implies *lack of freedom*.\n*Yǎn* means *serene and composed*.\n*Huàn* means *relaxed and dispersing*—\nLike ice on the verge of thawing,\nSeemingly scattered yet still bound.\n\n*Dūn* means *thick/dense*.\n*Uncarved wood* conveys *wholeness*.\n*Kuàng* means *open/expansive*.\n*Valley* means *void*.\n*Muddy water*—\nWhen left undisturbed, it grows clear;\nWhen stirred, it remains muddy.\nWithin the muddy, if held still,\nSlowly it clears itself.\n*Motionless for long*—\nIf left undisturbed, it moves gently,\nThus it *slowly generates*.\n\n*Who can*—\nAsking who can achieve such balance.\n*Slowly*—\nMeans *with ease*, *gradually*.\n\nThese two lines simply mean\nThat clarity and stillness coexist,\nMotion and rest intertwine—\nClear within the muddy, still within the moving.\n\n*Does not seek fullness*—\nThis is *emptiness*.\n*Decay*—\nMeans *old/used*.\nHe who preserves this Dao\nIs always empty within,\nThus he only sees the old,\nNot the new—\nThis is the Way of the first chapter.\n\nTo endure decay without renewal,\nIs to remain unchanged for a thousand years.\n\nOnly then can one achieve true mastery of the Dao.\nThus, *to endure decay without renewal* is one phrase,\n*Mastery* is another.\n\n「Penetrating stillness is steadfastness.\nTo attain emptiness and stillness,\nThen to witness the myriad things in their generation,\nAnd observe their return to their roots—\nThis is the Way.\n\n*Generation* is *birth*.\n*Return* is the time when they revert to their roots and restore their vital essence.\nThis is the essence of *constancy*—\nTo observe its subtlety without craving,\nTo perceive its openings with natural desire.\n*Keynote* (芸芸) is like *flourishing* (纷纷).\n\nThough things flourish in abundance,\nTheir end is to return to their roots.\nOnce they return to their roots,\nThis is the time when motion reaches its extreme and stillness ensues—\nThis is the natural principle,\nWherefrom the restoration of vital essence begins,\nHence it is called *restoration of vital essence* (复命).\nTo attain the state of restored vital essence,\nIs to be constant and enduring without change.\n\nHe who knows the constant and enduring Dao,\nOnly then is he called *enlightened* (明).\nThis is the meaning of:\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao*,\n*The name that can be named is not the constant name*.\n\nMen alone fail to recognize this constant Dao,\nThus they harbor reckless thoughts and reckless actions—\nAll these are the calamities of straying from the Dao.\n\nTo know constancy,\nThen one’s heart aligns with the vastness of Heaven and Earth—\nWhat cannot it embrace?\nOnce able to embrace,\nThen what matter cannot it govern justly?\nHe who rules the world,\nIs he who embodies this just Dao.\n\nTo rule by this just Dao,\nIs to harmonize with Heaven—\nHeaven is the Dao itself,\nThus it is said: *ruling is Heaven*,\n*Heaven is the Dao*.\n\n*Enduring* is *constancy*.\nIf one attains this constant Dao,\nThen throughout one’s life there is nothing outside the Dao—\nHow could one perish?\nThis applies to all, from the Son of Heaven down to the common folk.\n\nThis is the meaning of the *Supreme Ultimate* chapter, the seventeenth.\n\n「The Supreme Dao, the people below merely know of its existence;\nThe next best thing, they cherish and praise it;\nThe next, they fear it;\nThe next, they scorn it;\nThus, trust is insufficient, and there arises distrust.\n*Ah, how they value words!*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe common folk all say, *\"This is how things naturally are.\"*\n*The Supreme Dao* refers to the age of antiquity.\n*Below*, it means the realm of all under Heaven.\nIn the ancient times, the people of all under Heaven only knew of the sovereign’s existence,\nYet all forgot themselves within the transformations of the Dao.\n\nLater, the people began to feel affection and praise toward the sovereign.\nAgain later, they began to feel fear and awe.\nAgain later, they began to scorn and mock.\nThis shows that the Way of the world declines ever downward.\nWhen the virtue/power of the Supreme Dao wanes,\nThe principle of sincerity grows insufficient,\nThus the people of all under Heaven begin to harbor distrust.\nThis is the meaning of the *merchants’ oaths* marking the start of rebellion,\nAnd the *gathering of the people* under the Zhou leading to suspicion.\nOnce the people doubt,\nYet those in governance still complacently value words,\nThus there arise proclamations, teachings, and edicts—\nDoes this not further deepen the people’s suspicions?\n*Ah, how they value words!*—\nThis is the meaning of *complacency*.\n\nIn the age of the Supreme Dao,\nDeeds were already accomplished,\nAffairs already fulfilled,\nAnd the people of all under Heaven silently received their blessings,\nYet did not know whence they came,\nAll saying, *\"This is how things naturally are.\"*\nThis is what is meant by: *The imperial virtue/power is upon me—what has it to do with me?*\n\nSince it is said that valuing words is wrong,\nYet this single phrase concludes it,\nThis is a lament for the present while reflecting upon the past.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness;\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, there arises great deceit;\nWhen the Six Relationships are discordant, there arise filial piety and kindness;\nWhen the state is in chaos, there arise loyal ministers.\n\nWhen the Great Dao prevails, benevolence and righteousness are inherent within it.\nOnce the names of benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao grows faint.\nThus it is said: *When the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness.*\nAs if the sun of wisdom and cleverness rises,\nAnd then deceit and falsehood flourish throughout the world.\nWhen the Six Relationships are discordant,\nThen the names of filial piety and kindness arise.\nIn times when the state is in chaos,\nThen the names of loyal ministers arise.\nThese three sentences are all parables,\nIllustrating the meaning of the preceding sentence.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Reject Learning and Worry Ceases**\n\nTo reject learning and abandon wisdom, the people benefit a hundredfold;\nTo reject benevolence and abandon righteousness, the people return to filial piety and kindness;\nTo reject cleverness and abandon profit, thieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three are considered insufficient in terms of culture,\nThus there arise their corresponding institutions.\n*Seeing simplicity and embracing purity,*\n*Few private concerns and little desire.*\n\nOnce the names of learning and wisdom emerge,\nThen the calamities of the world arise—\nBetter to reject and abandon them,\nAnd the people will naturally benefit.\nOnce the names of benevolence and righteousness arise,\nThen distinctions between filial and unfilial,\nKind and unkind, begin to emerge—\nBetter to reject and discard them,\nAnd let the people forget the Dao,\nThen all will return to the midst of filial piety and kindness,\nWithout any need for distinctions.\n\nWhen cleverness and profit are valued,\nThen thieves and robbers will arise—\nBetter to reject and abandon them,\nThis is what is meant by: *Do not esteem difficult-to-obtain goods,*\n*So that the people will not become thieves.*\n\nLearning and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness,\nCleverness and profit—\nThese three are all the Way of the world\nGrowing ever more refined and cultural,\nThus their names arise.\nFrom the perspective of one who knows the Dao,\nThis refinement is not beneficial for governing the world—\nBetter to entrust the people,\nAnd let them see simplicity and embrace purity,\nFew private concerns and little desire,\nThen the world will naturally have no troubles.\n\n*Order* means *to make*;\n*Entrust* is akin to the reading of *属民* in the *Rites of Zhou*.\nThis meaning is to say:\nThe more advanced the cultural governance,\nThe thinner the Way of the world becomes—\nBetter to return to simplicity and purity,\nAs in the age of antiquity.\nThis is also a speech of one’s time, filled with frustration at the world’s state.\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Reject Learning, Worry Ceases**\n\n**Chapter Twenty: Reject Learning, Worry Ceases**\n\n*\"Yes\" and \"Ah\"*—how far apart are they?\n*\"Good\"* and *\"evil\"*—how distant are they?\n\nWhat people fear, I dare not fail to fear.\nOh, the chaos—its endlessness!\n\nThe multitude bustles, feasting as on a grand sacrifice,\nAscending spring platforms with joy.\nYet I alone remain still, unformed—\nLike an infant yet to stir,\nDrifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.\n\nThe multitude all have excess;\nI alone seem abandoned.\nAh, my foolish heart—so muddled!\n\nThe common man is bright and clear;\nI alone seem dim.\nThe common man is sharp and keen;\nI alone am dull and clouded.\n\nSerene as the sea, yet restless as the wind,\nEndless, with no place to rest.\n\nThe multitude all have their schemes;\nI alone am stubborn and crude.\nI differ from others—\nYet I prize savoring the Mother.\n\nTo practice the Dao is daily subtraction;\nTo study is daily addition.\nThese words must not be confused with Confucian texts—\nFor learning only distances one from the Dao.\n\nReject learning and return to the Uncarved,\nThen there will be no worry.\n\n*\"Yes\"* and *\"Ah\"* are both affirmations.\nMen who study take *\"good\"* over *\"evil\"*—\nJust as one might say *\"Yes\"* triumphs over *\"Ah\"*—\nYet it is better to discard even the name of *\"good.\"*\n\nThis is the meaning: *\"When all under heaven know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises.\"*\n\nYet even the ancients who knew the Dao,\nThough they deemed both *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"* unworthy,\nStill had things they feared.\nWhatever people fear, I have never failed to fear.\n\nIf I were to treat all fears as unworthy,\nThen where would the chaos end?\n\nChaos—this is disorder.\nEndless—without limit.\n\nThe Chan school speaks of sudden awakening,\nBreaking through cause and effect—\nThis is the fear people have yet do not fear.\n\nWild and unrestrained, inviting calamity—\nThis is the *\"Oh, the chaos—its endlessness!\"*\n\nThe multitude delights in worldly flavors,\nFeasting as on a grand sacrifice,\nAscending spring platforms—\nYet I alone take joy in simplicity,\nNo thoughts taking form,\nLike an infant yet to stir,\nDrifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.\n\n*Unformed*—this means no stirrings, no movement.\nThus, *\"unformed.\"*\n\n*Infant*—just born.\n*Child*—slightly grown.\nThe heart of an infant knows nothing at all.\n\n*Drifting, drifting*—as if motionless.\n*Nowhere bound*—untouched by traces.\n\nThis is how I differ from the multitude—\nThey all seek gain and excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned.\nAm I truly foolish, so muddled?\n\n*Muddled*—utterly confused, without knowledge.\nThis means I take no pleasure in excess,\nNor do I harbor thoughts of surplus—\nNot because I am foolish, but because you are wise.\n\n*Dim and clouded*—this is the same as *muddled.*\nThe common man is bright and sharp,\nWhile I alone am dim and clouded—\nThis is how I differ.\n\nMy heart is serene, like a boat on the great sea,\nThe wind howling without rest—\nThis is the meaning of *drifting, drifting, as if nowhere bound.*\n\n*Have schemes*—to act with purpose.\nThe multitude all act with purpose,\nWhile I take joy in seeking nothing—\nThus I seem stubborn and crude.\nAm I truly crude?\n\nI differ from others only in savoring the Dao.\n\nThe Mother of ten thousand things—\n*Mother*—this is the Dao.\n*Food*—this is *savoring.*\nTo prize savoring the Mother—\nThis means to value tasting the Dao.\n\n「The Chapter on the Appearance of Great Virtue (Chapter 21)\nThe appearance of great virtue follows only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nOnly vague, only indistinct.\nIndistinct yet vague—\nWithin it lies an *image* (xiàng).\nVague yet indistinct—\nIts *weaving* (zhī) contains *things* (wù).\nDeep and dark—\nWithin it lies *essence* (jīng).\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it lies *faith* (xìn).\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name does not fade,\nFor it encompasses all *beauties* (méi).\nHow do I know all beauties are thus?\nBecause of this.\n*孔* (Kǒng), means *abundant* (shèng).\nThose who understand the Dao,\nFollow only the Dao,\nYet what they manifest outwardly—\nThey possess the appearance of abundant virtue.\n*德* (Virtue) as a word means *obtain* (dé).\nTo obtain it from oneself is virtue.\nThe Dao is unseen, yet virtue is seen,\nThus virtue is called the appearance of the Dao.\n\nMencius said: *\"When one’s movements and demeanor are measured and harmonious, that is the utmost of virtue.\"*\nThis sentence differs slightly.\nBut those who read Zhuangzi and Laozi,\nShould observe them through the lens of their own words—\nIf one seeks to reconcile them with Confucius and Mencius,\nThen the language becomes too constrained.\n\nOnly vague, only indistinct—\nThis speaks of the Dao’s unseen nature.\nThough unseen, it is not without substance,\nThus it is said: *Within it lies an image,*\n*Within it lies things,*\n*Within it lies essence.*\nThis is the meaning of *true emptiness and then real existence.*\n\nIts essence is most true,\nWithin it lies faith—\nThese two sentences reveal that within the void,\nThere is truly substance,\nAnd this cannot be dismissed as empty words.\n*信* (Faith) means *reality* (shí).\n\nThe Dao’s name persists through antiquity and modernity,\nNever vanishing for a single day,\nAnd all good things arise from it.\n*众美* (All beauties) are the myriad virtues.\n*历阅* (Encompassing) means to traverse and witness.\nAll good things come and go,\nAll from this Dao.\n*以此者* (Because of this) means *because of the Dao.*\nI know that all beauties originate thus—\nIt is because of this Dao alone.\nThis kind of concluding phrase\nIs also the refined essence of the text.\n\n**The Chapter on Flexibility and Fullness (Chapter 22)**\nWhen *flexible* (qū), one is *whole* (quán);\nWhen *crooked* (wǎng), one is *straight* (zhí);\nWhen *hollowed* (wā), one is *filled* (yíng);\nWhen *worn* (bì), one is *renewed* (xīn);\nWhen *few* (shǎo), one *gains* (dé);\nWhen *many* (duō), one is *bewildered* (huò).\nThus the Sage holds *oneness* (yī) as the model for all under heaven.\nNot self-displaying, hence *bright* (míng);\nNot self-asserting, hence *illustrious* (zhāng);\nNot self-praising, hence *accomplished* (gōng);\nNot self-exalting, hence *enduring* (cháng).\n\nOnly by not contending,\nIs the Sage unmatched by all under heaven in contention.\n\nThe ancients spoke of *flexibility leading to fullness*—\nWas this empty talk?\nIndeed, it is fullness and return.\n\nTo be flexible and then whole,\nTo be crooked and then straight,\nTo be hollowed and then filled,\nTo be worn and then renewed—\nTo be few and then many—\nAll speak of the meaning:\n*To be insufficient and then have abundance,*\n*To be truly empty and then real existence.*\n\n*Few yet gain, many yet bewildered*—\nThis is merely the phrase *few, many* (shǎo duō),\nFurther refined into two sentences.\n\n*One* (yī) is the *void* (xū),\nThe *unseen* (wú),\nThe *insufficient* (bùzú).\nThe Sage holds only this principle of *oneness*,\nThus it becomes the standard for all under heaven.\n\nNot self-displaying,\nNot self-asserting,\nNot self-praising,\nNot self-exalting—\nAll mean *not claiming what one has.*\n\nI, with an empty heart,\nContend with nothing under heaven—\nThen what is there to contend?\n\n*Enduring* (cháng) means *long-lasting* (kě jiǔ).\nHaving said this,\nYet it brings back the earlier phrase *flexibility leading to fullness*,\nTo conclude thus—\nThis is also a marvel of the text.\n\nHeaven and Earth, with me,\nHave no lack or defect—\nI but return to fullness,\nAnd what else is there to do?\n\n*诚* (Indeed) means *reality* (shí).\nThe four sentences on *flexibility, crookedness, hollowness, and wear*\nAre all parables,\nTo reveal the meaning below.\n\n**The Chapter on Sparse Speech and Naturalness (Chapter 23)**\n*Sparse speech* (xī yán) is *naturalness* (zìrán).*」\n\n---\n\nThus, gusts of wind do not last the morning,\nAnd sudden rains do not last the day.\nWho does this?\nHeaven and Earth.\n\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot endure—\nHow much less can mortals?\n\nTherefore, those who follow the Dao:\nThose aligned with the Dao are one with the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue are one with virtue,\nThose aligned with loss are one with loss.\n\nThose one with the Dao—\nThe Dao delights in them;\nThose one with virtue—\nVirtue delights in them;\nThose one with loss—\nLoss delights in them.\n\nFaith insufficient, there is doubt.\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nOnly the two words *natural* and *sparse*\nCan exhaust the principle of Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Sparse*—few.\nThese two words, though few in speech,\nYet the principle of Heaven and Earth is no more than this.\n\nThough gusts and sudden rains are wrought by Heaven and Earth,\nThey do not last the morning, nor the day—\nHow can human gain and ruin, rise and fall,\nBe constant?\n\nThose who follow the Dao—\nThey who study the Way.\nThe Way—action.\nVirtue—attainment.\nWhat may be acted upon, I act upon—\nI do not resist.\nWhat may be attained, I attain—\nI do not resist.\nWhat may be lost, I lose—\nI do not resist.\n\n*One*—to follow in harmony without resistance.\nWhat may be acted upon, I delight in attaining;\nWhat may be attained, I delight in attaining;\nWhat may be decided—whether gain or loss—I delight in it all—\nThis is why they are called *knowers of the Dao*.\n\nYet this requires sufficient faith.\nIf faith is lacking where it should be,\nThen one cannot fully trust oneself.\n\nThus it is said:\n*Faith insufficient, there is doubt.*\n\n**The Chapter on the Unsteady Not Standing (Chapter 24)**\nThe unsteady does not stand,\nThe straddling cannot walk.\nThe self-revealing are blind,\nThe self-righteous are unilluminated,\nThe self-praising achieve nothing,\nThe self-exalting do not endure.\n\nIn the Dao, they are called *excess food, superfluous limbs*.\nThings naturally abhor them,\nThus the Daoist does not dwell upon them.\n\n*Unsteady*—feet not touching the ground.\nStanding on tiptoe, one cannot endure.\n*Straddling*—thighs not touching.\nStraddling, one cannot walk.\nThese two sentences are metaphors.\n\nSelf-revealing, self-righteous, self-praising, self-exalting—\nAll are those who claim what they have and do not transform.\n*Unilluminated*—self-obscured.\n*Unilluminated*—name not displayed.\n*Not enduring*—cannot last long.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Fullness cannot endure long.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\n*Excess food, superfluous limbs*—\nAll are burdens.\nThe Daoist makes no progress;\nProgress is a burden.\n*Says excess, says superfluous*—\nIn the manner of Zhuangzi’s *conjoined toes, branched fingers*.\nFood’s excess is discarded,\nForm’s superfluity is a blemish—\nMankind naturally abhors them,\nThus the Daoist does not dwell upon them,\nSaying: *Do not burden oneself with traces.*\n\n**The Chapter on the Indiscernible Mixture (Chapter 25)**\nThere is a thing, mixed and complete,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth,\nSilent and vast,\nStanding alone yet unchanging,\nCirculating yet without peril,\nIt can be the Mother of all under Heaven.\n\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the Dao.\nForcibly naming it, I say: *Great*.\n*Great* says: *Passing*,\n*Passing* says: *Distant*,\n*Distant* says: *Returning*.\n\nThus, the Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sage is great.\nWithin the realm, there are four *Greats*—\nAnd the Sage occupies one.\n\nOne follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows Naturalness.\n\n*There is a thing, mixed and complete*—\nThe Dao.\nThe *Unexcelled* and the *Supreme Polarity*.\nIts birth precedes Heaven and Earth—\nSaying Heaven and Earth arise from it.\n*Silent and vast*—\nInvisible.\n*Standing alone yet unchanging*—\nEnduring yet unaltered.\n*Circulating yet without peril*—\nVigorous yet unceasing.\n*It can be the Mother of all under Heaven*—\nThe source from which all things arise.\n\nI do not know its name—\nIt cannot be named.\nSince it cannot be named,\nI call it the Dao.\n*Call*—a substitute term.\n\n*Says the Dao*—\nYet the Dao is insufficient to exhaust it,\nSo I forcibly name it *Great*.\n*Great*—\nYet *Great* is insufficient to exhaust it,\nSo I name it *Passing*.\n*Passing*—\nGoing, yet cannot be pursued.\n*Passing*—\nYet *Passing* is insufficient to exhaust it,\nSo I forcibly name it *Distant*.\n*Distant*—\nCannot be approached, cannot be clung to.\n*Distant*—\nYet *Distant* is insufficient to exhaust it,\nSo I forcibly name it *Returning*.\n*Returning*—\nThe meaning of returning to the root.\n\nThese are rhetorical flourishes—\nIn *Zhuangzi*, such abound.\nSome mistakenly take *Returning* as *seeking within oneself*—\nThis is wrong.\n\n*Within the realm, there are four Greats*—\nThe Sage dwells in one.\nIt means: though mankind resides between Heaven and Earth,\nThey know only the Sage as great,\nYet above the Sage, there are three greater still.\n\nYet one follows Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows Naturalness—\nThus, Naturalness is greater than the Dao, Heaven, and Earth.\n\nIts intent is but to say:\nThe Dao reaches its extreme in Naturalness—\nSuch is the marvelous argument.\n\n**The Chapter on the Heavy as Light’s Root (Chapter 26)**\nThe heavy is the root of the light,\nThe still is the lord of the restless.\n\nThus the sage always says:\n*\"Action does not depart from the baggage train.\"*\nThough there be splendid palaces,\nHe dwells aloof and serene.\n\nHow can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nMake his body light for all under Heaven?\nLightness brings loss of ministers,\nRestlessness brings loss of the self.\n\nThere is heavy, there is light,\nThere is still, there is restless.\n*Root*—\nSaying lightness arises from heaviness.\n*Lord*—\nSaying stillness governs restlessness.\n\nThe Daoist, throughout the day,\nWalks without clinging to baggage—\nSaying: without heaviness, there is no lightness;\nWithout stillness, there is no restlessness.\n\n*Depart*—\nTo adhere.\nHis mind’s vision reaches the utmost beauty of all under Heaven—\nThus *splendid palaces*.\nThough such palaces exist,\nHe dwells in them with ease—\nThus, he stands aloof beyond lightness, heaviness, stillness, and restlessness.\n\n「燕，安也。\n*Yan* is tranquility.\n\n处一居也，犹吾书所谓安行广居也。\nTo dwell in one place is to abide—\nJust as my writings say: to walk in ease and dwell in breadth.\n\n为万乘之主，若不知身之为重，\nTo rule the ten thousand chariots,\nIf one does not know the weight of the body—\n\n则不能超然於事物之外，必至有轻躁之失。\nThen one cannot stand aloof beyond things,\nSurely falling into the faults of lightness and restlessness.\n\n失臣者，不足以臣服天下也。\nTo lose ministers means\nOne cannot make all under Heaven submit.\n\n失君者，言自失所主也。\nTo lose the self means\nOne has lost what one governs.\n\n以身轻天下者，言以天下为重，以身为轻也。\nTo make the body light for all under Heaven—\nThis means to regard all under Heaven as weighty,\nAnd the body as light.\n\n不轻其身则知道矣，\nIf one does not slight the body,\nThen one knows the Dao.\n\n知道则知自然矣，\nKnowing the Dao,\nOne knows spontaneity.\n\n知自然则无静无重矣，而况有轻躁乎？\nKnowing spontaneity,\nThere is neither stillness nor weight—\nHow much less restlessness and lightness?\n\n**善行无辙迹章第二十七**\nThe chapter on *good walking leaving no tracks*—\n\n善行无辙迹，\nGood walking leaves no tracks,\n善言无瑕谪，\nGood speech has no flaws or blemishes,\n善计不用筹策，\nGood plans need no calculations or schemes,\n善闭无关楗而不可开，\nGood closure has no locks or bars yet cannot be opened,\n善结无绳约而不可解。\nGood binding has no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.\n\n是以圣人常善救人，故无弃人，\nThus the sage always excels in saving others—\nTherefore, he abandons no one,\n常善教物，故无弃物，\nAlways excels in teaching things—\nTherefore, he abandons no thing,\n是谓袭明。\nThis is called *concealing brightness*.\n\n故善人，不善人之师；\nThus the good person is the teacher of the not-good,\n不善人，善人之资。\nThe not-good person is the material of the good.\n\n不贵其师，不爱其资，\nIf one does not honor his teacher,\nOr cherish his material—\n虽智大迷，\nThough wise, it is great confusion,\n是谓要妙。\nThis is called *the essential subtlety*.\n\n善行、善言、善计、善闭、善结，五者皆譬喻也。\nGood walking, good speech, good plans, good closure, good binding—\nThese five are all metaphors.\n\n其意但谓以自然为道，则无所容力，\nTheir meaning simply states:\nIf spontaneity is taken as the Dao,\nThen there is no need to exert force—\n亦无所着迹矣。\nNor to leave any traces.\n\n圣人虽异於众人，而混然与之而处，\nThe sage, though different from the common folk,\nYet blends harmoniously with them in dwelling—\n未尝有自异之心，\nNever harboring a thought of self-difference,\n所以不见其迹也。\nThus his traces are unseen.\n\n圣人之道，可以救人，可以救物。\nThe sage’s Dao\nCan save people, can save things.\n\n其於人物也，亦甚异矣，\nIn its relation to people and things,\nIt is also very different—\n而未尝有弃人弃物之心。\nYet the sage never has a heart to abandon people or things.\n\n和光同尘而与之为一，故曰袭明。\nHe blends with the light and mingles with the dust,\nYet remains as one with them—\nThus it is called *concealing brightness*.\n\n袭者，藏也，\n*Concealing*—\nThis is *hiding*.\n袭明却庄子所谓滑疑之耀也。\n*Concealing brightness* is the opposite of Zhuangzi’s *shimmering doubt*—\n\n善人可以师范一世，\nThe good person can serve as a model for the age—\n虽异於不善之人，\nThough different from the not-good—\n而天下若无不善之人，则谁知善人之为善，\nYet if all under Heaven were not-good,\nWho would know the good person’s goodness?\n是不善人乃为善人之资也。\nThus the not-good person is the material for the good.\n\n资者，言其赖之以自别也。\n*Material*—\nThis means relying on it to distinguish oneself.\n\n此两句又发明上面无弃人无弃物之意。\nThese two lines further elucidate\nThe meaning above of abandoning neither people nor things.\n\n若有弃人弃物之心，\nIf one harbors a heart to abandon people or things—\n则是有师而不知贵，\nThen one has a teacher yet does not honor it,\n有资而不知爱，\nHas material yet does not cherish it—\n虽自以为智，而不知乃迷之大者。\nThough one may deem himself wise,\nHe does not know this is great confusion.\n\n知此道者，可谓要妙之道。\nHe who knows this Dao\nCan be called the *essential subtlety*.\n\n**知其雄章第二十八**\nThe chapter on *knowing the masculine*—\n\n知其雄，\nKnowing the masculine,\n守其雌，\nAnd holding to the feminine—\n为天下溪。\nMakes one the valley of all under Heaven.\n\n为天下溪，常德不离，\nTo be the valley of all under Heaven,\nOne’s constant virtue never departs—\n复归於婴儿。\nReturning again to the state of the infant.\n\n知其白，\nKnowing the white,\n守其黑，\nAnd holding to the black—\n为天下式。\nMakes one the pattern of all under Heaven.\n\n为天下式，常德不忒，\nTo be the pattern of all under Heaven,\nOne’s constant virtue never errs—\n复归於无极。\nReturning again to the boundless.\n\n知其荣，\nKnowing the honor,\n守其辱，\nAnd holding to the humiliation—\n为天下谷。\nMakes one the valley of all under Heaven.\n\n常德乃足，\nOne’s constant virtue is complete—\n复归於朴。\nReturning again to simplicity.\n\n朴散则为器，\nSimplicity disperses and becomes vessels—\n圣人用之则为官长，\nThe sage uses them and becomes the ruler—\n故大制不割。\nThus the great measure is not severed.\n\n知雄守雌，不求胜也。\nKnowing the masculine and holding to the feminine,\nOne does not seek to conquer.\n\n知白守黑，不分别也。\nKnowing the white and holding to the black,\nOne does not distinguish.\n\n知荣守辱，无歆艳也。\nKnowing the honor and holding to the humiliation,\nOne has no fondness for brilliance.\n\n知守有能为而不为之意。\nKnowing and holding implies\nThe power to act yet not acting.\n\n溪谷在下，\nThe valley is low—\n一水所归也，\nWhere waters converge—\n言如此则天下归之。\nSaying this, all under Heaven will follow.\n\n式，天下以为式也。\n*Pattern*—\nThis is what all under Heaven takes as its model.\n\n常德，\nConstant virtue—\n即首章所谓常道也。\nIs the *constant Way* spoken of in the first chapter.\n\n不离，\nNever departing—\n无间断也。\nMeans no interruption.\n\n不忒，\nNever erring—\n无差失也。\nMeans no deviation.\n\n乃足，\nComplete—\n备全之也。\nIs fully sufficient.\n\n婴儿，\nThe infant—\n无知也。\nIs without knowledge.\n\n无极，\nThe boundless—\n无物也。\nIs without things.\n\n朴，\n*Simplicity*—\n太朴也，\nThis is *Great Simplicity*—\n天地之始也。\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n太朴既散，而后有器，\nGreat Simplicity having dispersed,\nThen vessels come into being—\n即形而上谓之道，形而下谓之器也。\nThis is the Dao of *that which is above form*,\nAnd vessels of *that which is below form*.\n\n圣人以形而上者，用形而下者，\nThe sage uses *that which is above form*\nAnd employs *that which is below form*—\n则天地之间各有其职。\nThus between Heaven and Earth,\nEach has its proper function.\n\n圣人兼三才，\nThe sage encompasses the Three Powers—\n以御万物，\nTo govern all things—\n虽职覆职载亦听命於我，\nThough functions overlap and shift,\nThey all obey his command—\n是为天地之间，官於物者之长也。\nThus he is the ruler of all things\nBetween Heaven and Earth.\n\n庄子曰：官天地。\nZhuangzi says: *He rules Heaven and Earth*.\n天地之职，\nThe functions of Heaven and Earth—\n亦造化之一官守耳。\nAre but one aspect of the natural transformations.\n\n割，\n*Sever*—\n离也。\nIs separation.\n\n以道制物谓之大制，\nTo govern things with the Dao is called *great measure*—\n大制则道器不相离矣。\nGreat measure means the Dao and things do not separate.\n\n此亦无为而为，自然而然之意。\nThis is also the meaning of *non-action yet action*,\nAnd *spontaneity as it is*.\n\n**将欲取天下章第二十九**\nThe chapter on *when one would take all under Heaven*—\n\n将欲取天下而为之者，\nWhen one would take all under Heaven by force—\n吾见其不得已。\nI see it as inevitable failure.\n\n天下神器，\nAll under Heaven is a divine vessel—\n不可为也。\nCannot be forced.\n\n为者败之，\nTo force it is to ruin it,\n执者失之。\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\n凡物或行或随，\nAll things either move forward or follow—\n或嘘或吹，\nEither exhale or inhale—\n或强或羸，\nEither are strong or weak—\n或载或隳。\nEither are completed or destroyed.\n\n是以圣人去甚，\nThus the sage avoids excess—\n去奢，\nAvoids extravagance—\n去泰。\nAnd avoids superfluity.\n\n天下神器，\nAll under Heaven is a divine vessel—\n岂人力所可得。\nHow can it be obtained by human strength?\n\n道盛德至，\nWhen the Dao flourishes and virtue reaches its peak—\n天下归之而不得辞，\nAll under Heaven submits to it without refusal—\n而后可以有天下。\nThen one may truly possess all under Heaven.\n\n若萌取天下之心，\nIf one harbors the thought of seizing all under Heaven—\n而强为善，\nAnd forcibly does good—\n以求有得，\nIn order to gain—\n次不可得矣。\nThen one will surely fail.\n\n此三句是譬喻也，\nThese three lines are metaphors—\n其意盖言凡天下之事，\nTheir meaning is: all things under Heaven—\n不可以有心求也。\nCannot be sought with a deliberate heart.\n\n为者则铃败，\nTo force is to ring the bell of ruin,\n执者则必失，\nTo grasp is to surely lose—\n是皆有心之累也。\nThese are both burdens of the deliberate heart.\n\n故有道者之於物，\nThus those who possess the Dao toward things—\n行者听其自行，\nLet those who move forward do so of their own accord,\n随者听其自随，\nLet those who follow do so naturally,\n嘘者听其自嘘，\nLet those who exhale do so spontaneously,\n吹者听其自吹，\nLet those who inhale do so freely,\n强者听其自强，\nLet the strong act as they will,\n羸者听其自羸，\nLet the weak be as they are,\n成者听其自成，\nLet the completed be so,\n隳者听其自隳，\nLet the destroyed be undone—\n是皆自然而然而已。\nAll this is but spontaneity as it is.」\n\n「圣人去之者，\nThe Sage removes it—\n无心无累，无为无求也。\nWithout deliberation or burden, without action or seeking.\n\n此章结得其文又奇，\nThis chapter concludes its text with yet another marvel—\n甚、奢、泰三字只是一意，\nThe three words *shen* (excess), *she* (extravagance), and *tai* (profligacy) all express one meaning,\n但如此下语，\nYet they are stated in this manner—\n非唯是其鼓舞之笔，\nNot only to inspire and exhort,\n亦申言其甚不可之意。\nBut also to emphasize how utterly unacceptable they are.\n\n其言玄妙，\nIts language is profound and mysterious—\n则曰玄之又玄，\nThen it speaks of *\"xuan\"* beyond *\"xuan\"*,\n则曰大，曰逝，曰远，\nThen it says *\"da\"* (vast), *\"shi\"* (flowing), *\"yuan\"* (distant),\n皆是一样文法。\nAll following the same rhetorical structure.\n\n读者不悟#3 其意，\nReaders who do not grasp its meaning—\n故不见他文字奇处，\nThus fail to see the brilliance of its other phrasing,\n又多牵强之说。\nAnd often resort to forced interpretations.\n\n以道佐人主章第三十\nChapter Thirty: Aiding the Sovereign with the Dao—\n以道佐人主者，\nThose who aid the sovereign with the Dao—\n不以兵强天下，\nDo not impose upon the world with arms,\n其事好还。\nFor their actions will return upon them.\n\n师之所处，\nWhere the armies encamp—\n荆棘生焉。\nThorns and brambles grow.\n大军之后，\nAfter great armies—\n必有凶年。\nThere will surely be years of calamity.\n故善者果而已矣，\nThus the virtuous act decisively—\n不敢以取强焉。\nWithout daring to seize force.\n\n果而勿矜，\nDecisive yet not arrogant,\n果而勿伐，\nDecisive yet not boastful,\n果而勿骄，\nDecisive yet not proud,\n果而不得已，\nDecisive yet without compulsion,\n果而勿强。\nDecisive yet not forceful.\n物壮则老，\nAll things, when at their peak, decline—\n是谓非道，\nThis is called *not* the Dao,\n非道早已。\nAnd the Dao rejects such early.\n\n佐人主而以强兵为心，\nTo aid the sovereign while harboring thoughts of military might—\n则非知道者矣。\nIs to not truly possess the Dao.\n\n何者？\nWhy?\n兵，凶器也。\nBecause arms are instruments of violence.\n我以害人，\nIf I use them to harm others,\n人亦将以害我，\nOthers will surely harm me in return—\n故曰其事好还。\nHence it is said: *\"their actions will return upon them.\"*\n\n用师之地，\nWhere armies are deployed—\n农不得耕，\nFarmers cannot till the fields,\n则荆棘生矣。\nThen thorns and brambles grow.\n用兵之后，\nAfter wielding arms—\n伤天地之和气，\nThe harmony of Heaven and Earth is disrupted,\n则必有凶年之苜。\nThen there will surely be years of calamity.\n\n此意但言好战求胜，\nThis meaning simply states that those who love war and seek victory—\n非国之福。\nAre not blessings for the state.\n七句只是譬喻。\nThese seven lines are but metaphors.\n\n若人之为善，\nIf people act in virtue—\n其果者在我，\nIts results lie within themselves,\n而何尝敢以此求胜於人，\nAnd how could they dare to use this to seek victory over others?\n故曰不敢以取强。\nHence it is said: *\"Without daring to seize force.\"*\n\n果，《易》言果行育德是也。\n*\"Fruit\"* (果), as the *Yijing* speaks: *\"Fruitful action nurtures virtue.\"*\n其果者在我，\nIts fruit lies within oneself—\n而不形诸外，\nYet does not manifest outwardly,\n则无矜伐骄强之名。\nThus there is no name of arrogance, boasting, pride, or force.\n而其应事也，\nAnd in responding to affairs—\n常有不得已之意，\nThere is always the sense of *\"not being able to help it,\"*\n此亦知雄守雌之论。\nThis is also the theory of *\"knowing the strong yet holding to the weak.\"*\n\n强者不能终强，\nThe forceful cannot persist in force,\n矜者不能终矜，\nThe arrogant cannot persist in arrogance,\n譬如万物既壮#4则老必至矣。\nJust as all things, once at their peak, must decline.\n不知此理，\nThose who do not understand this principle—\n而欲以取强於天下，\nYet wish to seize force in the world—\n皆不道者也。\nAre all those who do not possess the Dao.\n既知此为不道，\nIf one knows this to be *not* the Dao—\n则当急急去之，\nThen one must urgently abandon it,\n故曰早已。\nHence it is said: *\"And the Dao rejects such early.\"*\n\n已者，已而勿为也。\n*\"Early\"* (已) means: *\"Having reached the limit, do not act.\"*\n\n夫佳兵章第三十一\nChapter Thirty-One: *\"The Fine Art of War\"*—\n夫佳兵者，\nNow, the fine art of war—\n不祥之器，\nIs an ill-omened instrument,\n物或恶之，\nWhich things may detest,\n故有道者不处。\nThus those who possess the Dao do not dwell upon it.\n\n是以君子居则贵左，\nHence, the noble one values the left in dwelling—\n用兵则贵右。\nYet values the right in wielding arms.\n兵者，\nArms—\n不祥之器，\nAre ill-omened instruments,\n非君子之器，\nNot the instruments of the noble,\n不得已而用之，\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\n恬淡为上。\nWith equanimity as the highest.\n\n故不美也，\nThus they are not beautiful—\n若美必乐之，\nIf they were beautiful, one would surely delight in them,\n乐之者是乐杀人也。\nAnd delighting in them is delighting in killing.\n夫乐杀人者，\nNow, those who delight in killing—\n不可得志於天下矣。\nCannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\n故吉事尚左，\nThus auspicious matters are honored on the left,\n凶事尚右。\nAnd inauspicious matters on the right.\n是以偏将军处左，\nHence, the subordinate general is placed on the left—\n上将军处右，\nWhile the supreme general is on the right,\n言居上势则以丧礼处之。\nSpeaking of those in high positions as if they were in mourning.\n\n杀人众多，\nMany are killed—\n以悲哀泣之。\nWith sorrowful tears.\n战胜，\nWhen victorious in battle—\n以丧礼处之。\nThey are treated as if in mourning.\n\n此章全是以兵为喻，\nThis entire chapter uses war as a metaphor—\n兼当时战争之习胜，\nAnd incorporates the prevailing customs of war at the time,\n故以此语戒之。\nThus warning with these words.\n佳兵，\n*\"Fine art of war\"*—\n喜用兵者也。\nRefers to those who love to use arms.\n以用兵为佳，\nTo consider wielding arms as fine—\n此不祥之人也，\nThis is the mark of an ill-omened person,\n以不祥之人而行不祥之事，\nWho engages in ill-omened deeds as an ill-omened person—\n故曰不祥之器。\nHence it is said: *\"Arms are ill-omened instruments.\"*\n\n此天下之所恶，\nThis is what the world detests,\n故有道者不为之。\nThus those who possess the Dao do not do it.\n\n且君子之居，\nMoreover, in dwelling—\n每以左为贵，\nThe noble always values the left,\n而兵则尚右，\nYet arms are honored on the right,\n便是古人亦以兵为不祥之事。\nThis shows that even the ancients regarded arms as inauspicious matters.\n非君子之所乐用，\nNot something the noble delights in using,\n必不得已而后为之，\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\n不幸而用兵，\nIf misfortune compels the use of arms—\n必以恬淡为尚。\nOne must uphold equanimity.\n\n恬淡，无味也，\n*\"Equanimity\"* (恬淡) is flavorless—\n即是不得已之意也，\nIt is the same as *\"not being able to help it,\"*\n虽胜亦不以为喜。\nEven if victorious, one does not take pleasure in it.\n不美者，\n*\"Not beautiful\"*—\n言用兵不是好事也。\nMeans that wielding arms is not a good thing.\n若以用兵为喜，\nIf one takes pleasure in wielding arms—\n则是以杀人为乐，\nThen it is to delight in killing,\n岂能得志於天下。\nHow could one achieve their desires in the world?\n\n孟子曰：不嗜杀人者能一之。\nMencius said: *\"Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.\"*\n亦此意也。\nThis is the same meaning.\n\n偏将军之职位本在上将军之下一\nThe subordinate general’s rank is naturally beneath that of the supreme general—\n今上将军居右，\nYet now the supreme general is on the right,\n而偏将军居左，\nAnd the subordinate general is on the left,\n是古人以兵为凶事，\nThis is because the ancients regarded war as an inauspicious matter,\n故以丧礼处之。\nThus they treated it with funeral rites.\n\n左，阳也。\nThe left is *yang*—\n右，阴也。\nThe right is *yin*—\n丧礼则尚阴，\nFuneral rites are associated with *yin*,\n幸而战胜，\nEven if victorious in battle—\n亦当以居丧之礼，\nOne should still observe mourning rites,\n泣死者而悲哀之可也。\nWeeping for the dead and expressing sorrow is proper.\n以势而言，\nIn terms of rank—\n下反居上，\nThe lower is paradoxically placed above,\n故曰言居上势。\nHence it is said: *\"Those in high positions as if in mourning.\"*\n\n此章之意，\nThe meaning of this chapter—\n盖言人之处世，\nIs that in life—\n有心於求胜者，\nThose who harbor thoughts of seeking victory—\n皆为凶而不为吉也。\nAre all inauspicious, not auspicious.\n\n道常无名章第三十二\nChapter Thirty-Two: *\"The Dao Is Ever Nameless\"*—\n道常无名，\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\n朴虽小，\nYet the primal simplicity, though small,\n天下不敢臣。\nThe world does not dare to treat it as a subject.\n侯王若能守，\nIf lords and kings can uphold it,\n万物将自宾。\nAll things will naturally submit.\n\n天地相合，\nHeaven and Earth unite—\n以降甘露，\nTo descend sweet dew,\n人莫之令而自均。\nWithout anyone commanding, it is naturally balanced.\n\n始制有名，\nOnly when names are first imposed—\n名亦既有。\nNames have already been given.\n夫亦将知止，\nThen one must also know when to stop—\n知止所以不殆。\nKnowing when to stop is how one avoids ruin.\n\n譬道之在天下，\nJust as the Dao exists in the world—\n由川谷之於江海也。\nIs like rivers and valleys to the ocean.\n\n道常无名，\nThe Dao is ever nameless—\n即可名非常名也。\nThus it can be named *\"the nameless beyond names.\"*\n无名之朴，\nThe nameless simplicity—\n道也。\nIs the Dao.\n虽若至小，\nThough it may seem the smallest,\n而天下莫不尊之，\nYet the world does not fail to revere it,\n孰敢卑之，\nWho dares to belittle it?\n故曰不敢臣。\nHence it is said: *\"The world does not dare to treat it as a subject.\"*\n\n为侯王者若能守此道，\nIf lords and kings can uphold this Dao—\n则万物自宾服之矣。\nThen all things will naturally submit to them.\n\n天至高也，\nHeaven is supremely high—\n下而接乎地，\nYet descends to meet the Earth,\n天气下降，\nHeaven’s *qi* descends,\n地气上腾，\nEarth’s *qi* ascends—\n而后甘露降焉。\nThen sweet dew descends.\n天地和，\nWhen Heaven and Earth are in harmony—\n则甘露降。\nThen sweet dew descends.\n民之在天下，\nThe people in the world—\n自生自养，\nNaturally give birth and nurture themselves,\n莫不埤平，\nAll things are balanced,\n谁实使之，\nWho truly commands it?\n自然之道也。\nIt is the Dao of nature.\n\n若容心而使，则不得其均平矣。\nIf one indulges the heart’s desires in governance, balance cannot be achieved.\n\n道之始，本无名焉，万物既作，而后有道之名。\nAt its origin, the Dao was nameless—\nOnly after all things took form did it receive the name \"Dao.\"\n\n制，作也，是朴散而为器也。\n*\"Zhi\"* means to shape—\nThis is when the undifferentiated simplicity (*pu*) disperses to become things.\n\n此名既有，则一生二，二生三，何所穷已。\nOnce named, it gives rise to two from one,\nThree from two—\nWhere does it end?\n\n知道之士，当於此而知止，则不循名而逐末矣。\nThose who understand the Dao must know when to stop here,\nLest they follow names and chase after trivialities.\n\n循名逐末，则危殆之所由生也，知止则不殆矣。\nChasing after names and trifles breeds peril—\nKnowing when to stop brings safety.\n\n川谷之水，铃归之江海而后止；\nThe waters of streams and valleys\nFlow toward the seas and only then find rest—\n天下万物，必归之道而后止。\nAll things under Heaven\nMust return to the Dao before finding rest.\n\n故曰道之在天下，犹川谷之於江海也。\nHence it is said: *\"The Dao’s place in the world\nIs like streams and valleys to the seas.\"*\n\n---\n知人者智章第三十三\n**Chapter 33: The Wise Know Others**\n\n知人者智，自知者明。\nTo know others is wisdom,\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\n\n胜人者有力，自胜者强。\nTo overcome others requires strength,\nTo overcome oneself is true power.\n\n知足者富，强行者有志。\nContentment brings wealth,\nPersistent action reveals resolve.\n\n不失其所者久，死而不亡者寿。\nWhoever remains in their proper place endures—\nTo die without perishing is true longevity.\n\n智，私智也。\n*\"Wisdom\"* here means discerning others’ hidden motives.\n\n明，在内者也。\n*\"Enlightenment\"* is self-awareness within.\n\n有力，角力於外者也。\n*\"Strength\"* is outward struggle against others.\n\n强，在内之果也。\n*\"True power\"* is the fruit of inner mastery.\n\n自胜者强，胜己之私谓之克也。\nTo conquer oneself is true power—\nOvercoming personal desires is victory.\n\n知足者富，无不足则常有余也。\nContentment is wealth—\nWanting nothing ensures abundance.\n\n志胜气则其强也不弱，\nWhen resolve overcomes *qi*, strength is unyielding—\n得其所安则久而不变，\nFinding true rest ensures enduring stability—\n故曰不失其所者久。\nHence it is said: *\"Whoever remains in their proper place endures.\"*\n\n孔子曰：朝闻道，夕死可矣。\nAs Confucius said:\n*\"To hear the Dao in the morning,\nDeath at dusk would be no loss.\"*\n\n死而不亡者寿，\nTo die without perishing is true longevity—\n亦此意也。\nThis carries the same meaning.\n\n此二句非言语所可解，自证自悟可也。\nThese two lines cannot be fully explained in words—\nSelf-verification and awakening suffice.\n\n---\n大道泛兮章第三十四\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\n大道泛兮，其可左右。\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nMoving without favor to left or right.\n\n万物恃之以生而不辞，\nAll things rely on it for life, yet it does not refuse—\n功成不居，\nIt accomplishes without claiming—\n衣被万物而不为主，\nIt clothes all things yet claims no lordship—\n故常无欲，可名於小矣；\nThus it ever desires nothing,\nAnd may be called \"small\"—\n万物归焉而不知主，可名於大矣。\nYet all things return to it, unaware of any master,\nAnd so it may be called \"great.\"\n\n是以圣人能成其大也，\nThus the Sage achieves greatness—\n以其不自大，故能成其大。\nBecause they do not exalt themselves,\nThey alone achieve true greatness.\n\n泛兮其可左右，\nFlowing without constraint,\n无所系着也。\nIt clings to nothing.\n\n物物皆道之所生，\nAll things are born of the Dao—\n何尝辞之。\nHow could it refuse them?\n\n既生矣，何尝居之以为功。\nOnce born, how could it claim them as its own deeds?\n\n衣被，蒙赖也。\n*\"Clothing\"* means covering and nurturing—\n万物皆蒙赖其利，\nAll things benefit from its grace—\n而道何尝有主宰之心，\nYet the Dao harbors no lordly intent—\n湛然而无所欲，\nSerene and desiring nothing—\n可谓之自小矣，\nThus it may be called \"small\"—\n故曰可名於小。\nHence it is named \"small.\"\n\n道虽小，而万物归之以为主，\nThough the Dao is small,\nAll things return to it as their master—\n道亦不自知，\nYet it knows not itself—\n岂不谓之大乎？\nHow then is it not called \"great\"?\n\n惟其能小，所以能大，\nOnly by being small\nCan it achieve greatness—\n圣人之所以不为大者，故能成其大也。\nThe Sage does not claim greatness,\nAnd thus achieves true greatness.\n\n此即守其雌，为天下溪之意。\nThis is the meaning of *\"embracing the feminine\"* and *\"being a valley to the world.\"*\n\n---\n执大象章第三十五\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Image**\n\n执大象，天下往。\nHold fast to the Great Image,\nAnd all under Heaven will follow.\n\n往而不害，安平泰。\nFollowing without obstruction,\nThey find peace, balance, and ease.\n\n乐与饵，过客止。\nOffer music and feasts,\nAnd passing guests will linger.\n\n道之出言，淡乎其无味。\nThe Dao’s words, when spoken,\nAre bland, without relish.\n\n视之不足见，听之不足闻，\nTo look upon it is unsatisfying,\nTo listen is unfulfilling—\n用之不可既。\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\n\n大象者，无象之象也。\nThe \"Great Image\" is the form of the formless—\n天下往者，执道而往行之天下也。\nThose who follow are those who uphold the Dao in their actions.\n\n以道而行，则天下孰得而害之。\nActing in accordance with the Dao,\nWho under Heaven could harm them?\n\n天下无所害，则安矣，平矣，泰矣。\nWithout harm in the world,\nThey are at peace, balanced, and at ease.\n三字亦只一意也。\nThese three words convey a single meaning.\n\n乐，钟鼓之乐也。\n*\"Music\"* refers to ceremonial bells and drums—\n饵，饮食也。\n*\"Feasts\"* means food and drink.\n张乐设馔以待嘉客，\nSetting out music and banquets to welcome honored guests—\n乐终食尽，客过则止矣。\nWhen the music ends and the feast is done,\nGuests depart.\n\n过者，去也，\n*\"Over\"* means to leave—\n是筵席必有散时也。\nBanquets must eventually conclude.\n\n道之可味，虽若甚淡，\nThough the Dao’s flavor seems bland—\n视之虽不可见，\nThough it cannot be seen—\n听之虽不足闻，\nThough it cannot be heard—\n言其不足悦耳目也，\nThis is because it does not please the senses—\n而用之於今古而不尽。\nYet its use spans past and present without end.\n\n此即物有尽而道无穷之意。\nThis conveys the idea that *\"things are finite, but the Dao is boundless.\"*\n\n道之出言，道形於言也，\nThe Dao’s words are its manifestation in speech—\n犹曰道之为言也。\nAs if to say: *\"The Dao’s name.\"*\n\n---\n将欲噏之章第三十六\n**Chapter 36: Before Taking Away**\n\n将欲噏之，必固张之；\nBefore you can gather,\nYou must first stretch it taut—\n将欲弱之，必固强之；\nBefore you can weaken,\nYou must first strengthen—\n将欲废之，必固兴之；\nBefore you can discard,\nYou must first establish—\n将欲夺之，必固与之，\nBefore you can take,\nYou must first give—\n是谓微明。\nThis is called *\"subtle enlightenment.\"*\n\n柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\n\n鱼不可脱於渊，\nFish cannot escape the depths—\n国之利器，不可以示人。\nNor should a nation’s sharpest tools be displayed to all.\n\n此章前八句皆是譬喻，\nThese first eight lines are all metaphors—\n只是得便宜处失便宜之意。\nIllustrating the principle of *\"gaining advantage by first yielding advantage.\"*\n\n噏，敛也，弛也。\n*\"Nyon\"* means to gather or relax—\n张者必弛，\nWhat is stretched must relax—\n强者必弱，\nWhat is strong must weaken—\n兴必有废，\nWhat is established must decay—\n得必有失。\nWhat is gained must be lost.\n\n与，得也。\n*\"Give\"* means to grant—\n夺，失也。\n*\"Take\"* means to deprive.\n\n人#5 惟不知，自以为喜，\n#5 People, in their ignorance, take pleasure—\n而不知此理虽晦而实明，\nYet they fail to see that though this principle seems obscure,\n故曰微明#6。\nIt is truly enlightening.\n\n微，犹晦也，\n*\"Subtle\"* is like *\"obscure\"*—\n言虽微而甚易见也。\nSaying that though subtle, it is easily perceived.\n\n但能柔弱，必可以胜刚强，\nOnly by embracing softness and weakness\n必可以胜刚强，\nCan one overcome hardness and strength—\n此亦守雌守黑之意。\nThis too is the meaning of *\"embracing the feminine and the dark.\"*\n\n渊，喻道也。\n*\"The depths\"* symbolize the Dao—\n鱼，喻人也。\n*\"Fish\"* symbolize people.\n人之不能外於道，犹鱼之不可脱於渊也。\nJust as people cannot exist outside the Dao,\nSo fish cannot escape the depths.\n\n国之利器，若以示人，盗贼之招也。\nA nation’s sharpest tools,\nIf displayed to others, invite thieves.\n\n道之为用在我，\nThe Dao’s power lies within—\n若自眩露而以求胜於物，\nYet if one flaunts it to outdo others—\n亦犹以国之利器而示人也。\nIt is like displaying a nation’s sharpest tools.\n\n此亦前章善者果而已，不可以取强之意。\nThis too echoes the earlier idea:\n*\"The good are content with their harvest—\nThey do not seek to dominate.\"*\n\n---\n道常无为章第三十七\n**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**\n\n道常无为，而无不为。\nThe Dao ever does nothing,\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\n侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\n\n化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。\nWhen transformation stirs to action,\nI would restrain it with the nameless simplicity.\n\n无名之朴，亦将不欲，\nThe nameless simplicity would also desire nothing—\n不欲以静，\nDesiring nothing, it would remain still—\n天下将自正。\nAnd the world would naturally align itself.\n\n此章与道常无名章语势皆同。\nThis chapter’s structure mirrors *\"The Dao Ever Has No Name.\"*\n\nThe Dao does nothing yet does everything—\nThis is the natural way of things.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold this Dao of non-action,\nThey would not strive to transform all things,\nYet all things would transform on their own.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, when transformations stir to rise,\nI would only restrain them with the nameless simplicity.\n\nTransformation is the change of all things.\nWhen myriad changes arise together,\nEndlessly pursuing one another,\nI would simply abide in the natural way.\n\nThey grow tumultuous, yet I remain serene—\nThus it is called *restraint*.\n\nThe \"transformation\" in the latter clause\nShould not be read as echoing the \"transformation\" above.\n\nWhat is this \"nameless simplicity\"?\nIt is simply the absence of desire.\n\nWithout desire, there is stillness;\nWith stillness, the world naturally aligns itself.\n\n\"Not desiring\" is the same as \"without desire,\"\nYet the \"not\" also carries the meaning of \"do not\"—\nThis is where effort is applied.\n\n---\n**End of Volume Two: *The Daoist Classic’s Oral Commentary***\n#1 *\"Return to the Non-Ultimate\"*—Original text omitted *\"return\"* (added from *Shadow Song Edition*).\n#2 *\"Also,

Three: *The Daoist Classic’s Oral Commentary***\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: *\"The Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate\"***\n\nThe Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate does not cling to virtue/power—\nThus it has virtue/power.\nThe virtue/power of the Lowly does not lose virtue/power—\nThus it lacks virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;\nThe virtue/power of the Lowly acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Ceremony acts with effort yet none respond—\nThen they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\n\nThus, one loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power,\nLoses virtue/power and then gains benevolence,\nLoses benevolence and then gains righteousness,\nLoses righteousness and then gains ceremony.\n\nCeremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreemptive knowledge is the adornment of the Dao/Way,\nAnd the origin of folly.\n\nThus, the true person dwells in substance, not in veneer;\nDwells in reality, not in adornment.\n\nHence, they abandon the latter and take the former.\n\nThe person of the Non-Ultimate’s Virtue/Power possesses virtue/power yet does not know their own transformative power—\nOnly their ability to transform is why they have virtue/power.\nThose who do not lose virtue/power cling to it without transformation—\nClinging without transformation is not yet virtue/power,\nHence it is called lacking virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate and the Lowly are merely the continuation of the previous chapter’s discussion on the *Taishang*’s Way.\n\n*\"Acts without effort yet nothing remains undone\"* means *\"acts without effort yet nothing is left undone.\"* (i)\nThe *\"for\"* (以) is the presence of intention.\n*\"Nothing remains undone\"* is acting without intention.\n\nThe Lowly’s *\"something remains incomplete\"* is the result of deliberate action—\nOf form and contrivance.\nHaving spoken of the Non-Ultimate’s and the Lowly’s virtue/power,\nHe then follows with benevolence and righteousness.\n\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone\"*—\nThis is benevolence as the Non-Ultimate’s virtue/power.\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete\"*—\nThis is righteousness as the Lowly’s virtue/power.\n\nThe Master Laozi’s teachings regard ceremony as a means to strengthen the world,\nFirst using benevolence and righteousness to modulate and balance its application,\nThen proceeding to ceremony—\nThus ceremony is the most inferior of the three.\n\nTo act yet meet no response is to compel the people while they do not follow—\n*Reng* (仍), to draw or pull.\nThe people do not follow, yet they are compelled by force.\n*Reng* is the act of forcibly drawing or pulling.\nThis is merely a vivid description of compelling the people—\nHence it is said: *\"They roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way is natural.\nVirtue/Power is what is obtained.\nThe natural transforms, the obtained does not—\nHence it is said: *\"One loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power.\"*\n\nBenevolence has the heart of love and benefit,\nAnd is yet lower than virtue/power.\nRighteousness has the heart of judgment and restraint,\nAnd is yet lower than benevolence.\nCeremony has the intention of compelling the people,\nAnd is yet lower than righteousness.\n\nThe Master Laozi’s terms for *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (ceremony)\nDiffer in meaning from those of Confucius and Mencius—\nOne may seek their intent within his text.\nIf one insists on their conventional meanings,\nThen they are all misapplied.\n\nCeremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness—\nIt speaks of outward adornment without inner sincerity.\nIts intent is that ceremony arises from human artifice,\nHence it is called the beginning of chaos.\n\nPreemptive knowledge is the accumulation of past words and deeds.\nTo take this as wisdom is to stray from the true Dao/Way.\n*Hua* (华) is the pursuit of externals.\nIf one takes this as wisdom, it is in fact self-delusion—\nHence it is called the origin of folly.\n\n*\"Substance\"* and *\"reality\"* are merely the intent of pursuing the inner.\n*\"Abandon the latter and take the former\"* means one does not adhere to ceremony but to the Dao/Way.\nThis is the Dao/Way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *\"The One of Old\"***\n\nThe One of Old—\nHeaven obtains the One and thus becomes clear,\nEarth obtains the One and thus becomes settled and tranquil,\nThe spirit obtains the One and thus becomes responsive and alive,\nThe grain obtains the One and thus becomes full,\nAll things obtain the One and thus come to life,\nThe lords and kings obtain the One and thus establish their rectitude over the world.\n\nTheir attainment is all through the One—\nHeaven without the One would fear dissolution,\nEarth without the One would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit without the One would fear stagnation,\nThe grain without the One would fear exhaustion,\nAll things without the One would fear annihilation,\nThe lords and kings without the One would fear losing their noble standing.\n\nThus, the noble depends on the humble as its root,\nThe high depends on the low as its foundation.\n\nHence, the lords and kings call themselves *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"few\"* (寡), *\"not abundant\"* (不谷)—\nIs this their dependence on the humble as root?\nOr is it not?\n\nThus, they have many chariots yet no chariots,\nDo not desire to be rounded like jade,\nNor to be polished like stone.\n\nThe One is the Dao/Way.\nHeaven’s clarity and the manifestation of its forms are through this Dao/Way,\nEarth’s tranquility and its capacity to bear all things are through this Dao/Way,\nThe spirit’s responsiveness and vitality are through this Dao/Way,\nThe grain’s fullness and abundance are through this Dao/Way—\nAll are through this Dao/Way.\n\nAll things’ coming to life is also through this Dao/Way,\nThe lords and kings’ rectitude over the myriad lands is also through this Dao/Way.\nTheir attainment is through this Dao/Way—\nThis is why they become clear, tranquil, alive, full, and rectified,\nAll through this Dao/Way.\n\n*Lie* (裂) is akin to *\"breaking\"* in the *Zhouyi* (I Ching) as *\"segmented.\"*\n*Fa* (发) is movement without stability.\n*Xie* (歇) is the fading of responsiveness and vitality.\n*Jie* (竭) is exhaustion.\nThe empty can receive—\nThe unempty is exhausted and thus cannot receive.\n\n*Ju* (蹶) is akin to *\"falling\"* or *\"losing one’s place.\"*\nTo be in a noble and high position yet lack this is to be like the fallen—\nHence it is said: *\"The noble and high would fear losing their standing.\"*\n\nThe humble and the low are as the previous chapter’s *\"few, yet they obtain it\"*—\nAll are empty yet not self-possessed.\n\nThe two sentences on *\"the noble depends on the humble\"* and *\"the high depends on the low\"*\nAre mere metaphors.\nWithout the humble, how can there be the noble?\nWithout the low, how can there be the high?\nThe low and the humble are the fundamental basis of the noble and the high.\n\nThe lords and kings’ self-designation as *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"few\"* (寡人), *\"not abundant\"* (不谷)\nAre all words of self-humility,\nAnd also metaphors for emptiness without self-possession.\n\n*\"Or is it not?\"* (非乎) asks:\nIf I say this, is there not truth in it?\nZhuangzi said: *\"‘Or is it not?’—Yet the historian Zengzi agreed!\"*\nThis is of the same rhetorical style,\nA peculiar turn in the text.\n\n*\"They have many chariots yet no chariots\"*—\nOriginally read *\"They have many praises yet no praises\"* (数誉无誉),\nBut *\"praise\"* (誉) is incorrect.\nThese two sentences are metaphors—\nIf read as *\"praise,\"* they do not align with the later imagery of *\"like jade\"* and *\"like stone.\"*\n\n*Zhi* (致) means *\"to arrive at\"* or *\"to attain,\"*\nHence *\"their attainment\"* is akin to *\"their reaching this state.\"*\nThe chariot is a collective term—\nCounting its parts—wheels, hubs, spokes, shafts, and crossbars—\nThen there is no chariot,\nThe chariot becomes merely a hollow name.\n\nThe state of being like jade or like stone—\nthen it shines with a *lingling* brilliance,\nfalls with a *luoluan* resonance,\nand is ultimately unchangeable.\n\nA chariot may be had or not had,\nbut jade and stone are fixed and unchangeable.\nThat which may be had or not had\napproaches the Dao—\nempty yet transformative.\n\nThat which is fixed and unchangeable\ndoes not transform.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"To say ‘no years’\"*—\nalso expressing the meaning of *\"counting chariots yet no chariots.\"*\n\n**Chapter Forty: The Movement of the Dao Through Reversal**\nReversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle,\nweakness is the Dao’s application.\n\nAll things arise from existence,\nexistence arises from non-existence.\n\nReversal means return,\nmeans stillness—\nstillness is the source from which movement arises,\nas in the *Yijing*’s saying:\n*\"Guàn completes the end and begins the beginning.\"*\n\nOnly by being weak can one become strong;\nto fixate on strength is to break.\n\nMovement employs stillness as its function,\nstrength employs weakness as its function—\nthus it is said:\n*Reversal is the Dao’s dynamic principle,*\n*weakness is the Dao’s application in strength.*\n\nSuch phrasing follows grammatical structure.\n\nOnly after Heaven and Earth do all things exist—\nthus it is said: *\"Things arise from existence.\"*\nYet who gave birth to Heaven and Earth?\nHeaven and Earth first arose from the Great Void—\nthus they arise from non-existence.\nThrough movement, stillness, strength, and weakness,\nthe origin of existence and non-existence is further expounded.\n\nThe teachings of Laozi\nlargely emphasize emptiness,\nemphasize weakness,\nemphasize lowliness—\nthus, extending this to the space between Heaven and Earth,\nhe speaks broadly of existence, non-existence, movement, and stillness,\nyet does not limit himself to Heaven and Earth alone.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One: The Superior Man Hears the Dao**\nThe superior man hears the Dao,\ndiligently practices it;\n\n「中士闻道，若存若亡；\nThe middle-ranking man hears the Dao,\nas if it were both present and absent.\n\n下士闻道，大笑之，不笑不足以为道。\nThe inferior man hears the Dao,\nand laughs greatly at it—\nfor if he does not laugh,\nit is not worthy to be called the Dao.\n\n故建言有之：\nThus, it is said:\n\n明道若昧，\nThe Dao is bright as if in darkness—\nfor only in darkness does brightness shine.\n\n夷道若类，\nThe Great Dao is smooth as if blending with the common—\nfor the Great Dao knows no distinctions,\nand harmonizes with the dust of the world.\n\n进道若退，\nAdvancing in the Dao appears as retreat—\nfor true retreat is the path to true progress.\n\n上德若谷，\nThe highest virtue is deep as a valley—\nfor it is empty yet not self-asserting.\n\n大白若辱，\nThe greatest purity is stained as dishonor—\nfor it does not gleam ostentatiously to set itself apart.\n\n广德若不足，\nVast virtue seems insufficient—\nfor if it were self-sufficient,\nit would be narrow indeed.\n\n建德若偷，\nEstablishing virtue appears as furtive—\nfor it is done by those who act,\nyet hesitate lest they be seen.\n\n质真若渝，\nPure authenticity seems to flow like water—\nfor its true and unchanging essence\nholds no trace of alteration,\nyet appears as if already transformed.\nThis too is the meaning of sufficiency without self-sufficiency.\n\n大方无隅，\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nfor within the Great Void,\nthough there be east, west, south, and north,\nwho can discern its boundaries?\n\n大器晚成，\nGreat vessels take time to form—\nlike casting a tripod,\nhow could it be swiftly completed?\n\n大音希声，\nGreat sound is rare in voice—\nthe greatest sounds between Heaven and Earth\nare none greater than wind and thunder,\nyet they are not always heard.\nRare means seldom seen.\n\n大象无形，\nGreat form is shapeless—\nfor the form of Heaven and Earth,\nwho can fully perceive?\n\n道隐无名，\nThe Dao is hidden and nameless—\nfor it cannot be captured by name.\n\n此数句，或是指实之语，或是譬喻之语，其意皆主於能虚能无而已。\nThese words,\nwhether pointing to reality or using metaphor,\nall emphasize the power of emptiness and non-attachment.\n\n贷者，与也，推以及人也，\n*Acquiring* means giving—\nto extend and share with others,\nfor those who embody the Dao\ncan give without possessing.\n\n成者，道之大成也，\n*Completion* is the great fulfillment of the Dao—\nfulfilling oneself and all things,\nand only then is it called great fulfillment.\n\n后章又曰：既以与人，己愈多。\nAs the next chapter states:\n*\"After giving to others,\none’s own abundance increases.\"*\nThis too reflects the same meaning.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two: The Dao Gives Birth to One**」\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: The Dao Gives Birth to One**\nThe Dao gives birth to One,\nOne gives birth to Two,\nTwo gives birth to Three,\nThree gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things bear yin while embracing yang,\nand their harmonizing *qi* arises from their interplay.\n\nWhat people detest—\nthe solitary, the widowed, the childless—\nare the very titles kings and nobles claim.\nThus, some things are diminished to grow,\nand others are increased to diminish.\n\nWhat people teach as doctrine,\nis also my teaching of *yi* (rightness).\nThe overbearing shall not meet a natural end.\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nOne is the *Tai Ji*.\nTwo is Heaven and Earth.\nThree is the Three Powers.\nAll speech arises from the void.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of all things,\nthe natural principle of spontaneity.\nOnce the Three Powers are established,\nthen the myriad things are born.\n\nThe myriad things take form through yin and yang,\nand their vitality flows through the harmonizing *qi* of emptiness.\nWhat people detest most—\nthe solitary, the widowed, the childless—\nare titles kings and nobles adopt,\na metaphor for those who embody the Dao in humility and selflessness.\n\nIts meaning is this:\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity all arise from non-being.\nThe myriad things take yin and yang as their substance,\nand their eternal generation comes from the harmonizing *qi* of emptiness.\nThose who study the Dao must embody this—\nvaluing emptiness and non-attachment above all.\n\nIn the world, some things are diminished to grow,\nand others are increased to diminish—\nthe principle of gain and loss is not constant.\nLike the moon, when full it must wane—\nthis is growth leading to loss.\nWhen waned, it swells again—\nthis is loss leading to growth.\n\nWhat people teach as doctrine\nrefers to the teachings of this age,\nyet they say: *\"My teachings are all of rightness.\"*\nBut those who seek only gain,\nwho seek only victory,\nknow not that the rigid breaks,\nthat fullness cannot endure.\nThus, the overbearing shall not meet a natural end.\n\nIf I teach through the Dao,\nI shall stand above all others—\nthe model all should follow.\nThus, I say: *\"I shall be their guiding teacher.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: The World’s Ultimate Softness**\nThe world’s ultimate softness\novercomes the world’s ultimate hardness.\nNothing enters where there is no gap—\nthus one knows the benefit of *wuwei*.\n\nThe teaching of the unsaid,\nthe benefit of *wuwei*—\nfew in the world can attain it.\n\nThe rigid is easily broken;\nthe soft endures forever.\nTo move through the world’s ultimate hardness with ultimate softness—\nlike water wearing away stone.\n\n*\"No gap\"* refers to the seamless *tan* (altar).\n*\"Nothing enters\"* means formlessness—\nlike the circulation of *yingwei* (nutritive and defensive *qi*) within the body,\nor the unbroken spaces where sunlight enters.\nThis is *\"nothing entering where there is no gap.\"*\nThese two lines are metaphorical.\n\nFrom this, one understands\nthe supreme principle of *wuwei* as *wuwei* yet *wuwei* as *youwei*.\n\nThe unsaid yet teaching takes effect,\nthe undone yet benefits are achieved—\nthese are the wondrous applications of the Dao.\nFew in the world can comprehend them.\n\n*\"Benefit\"* means functional efficacy.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Great Fullness as if Deficient**\nGreat fullness seems deficient—\nits use is inexhaustible.\nGreat abundance seems empty—\nits use is boundless.\nGreat straightness seems crooked,\ngreat skill seems clumsy,\ngreat eloquence seems inarticulate.\n\nExcessive vigor overcomes cold,\nexcessive stillness overcomes heat—\nclearing and stillness are the world’s norm.\n\nWhen fullness exists, deficiency follows.\nGreat fullness ever seems deficient—\nthus its use is inexhaustible.\nWhen abundance exists, emptiness follows.\nGreat abundance ever seems empty—\nthus its use is boundless.\n\nAs the previous chapter states:\n*\"Hollowed becomes full,\nworn becomes renewed\"*—\nthis is the same meaning.\n\nGreat straightness ever seems crooked—\ncrookedness is true straightness.\nThe curved preserves completeness.\nGreat skill ever seems clumsy—\nit does not boast.\nGreat eloquence ever seems inarticulate—\nit does not speak much.\n\nExcessive vigor reaches cold,\nexcessive stillness reaches heat.\nVigor and stillness are but yin and yang—\nwhen *qi* stagnates in one extreme, it becomes a disorder.\nOnly the Dao’s clearing and stillness,\nneither being nor non-being,\nneither motion nor stillness,\nis the world’s true norm—\nthe model for all under Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: When the World Embraces the Dao**\nWhen the world embraces the Dao,\neven swift horses plow fields.\nWhen the world rejects the Dao,\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs.\n\nNo guilt is greater than craving,\nno disaster than insatiability,\nno blame than greed.\nThus, true sufficiency is always sufficient.\n\nTo drive swift horses backward to till fields—\nthis means not valuing rare goods.\nWarhorses breeding in the suburbs—\nthis speaks of warfare.\n\nAll conflicts arise from desire.\nOnce desire takes root,\nwhen will it ever be enough?\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six (continued): On the Pursuit of Desire**\nOnly the pursuit of what one *desires* is the root of guilt, disaster, and blame.\nOnly those who *know sufficiency* regard what they lack as enough—\nthen they are always sufficient.\nThis further elucidates the previous chapter’s meaning of *knowing sufficiency* without humiliation.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Seven: Knowing Without Venturing Forth**\nNot venturing beyond one’s door,\nyet knowing all under Heaven;\nNot peering through a window,\nyet seeing the Dao of the world.\nThe farther one goes,\nthe less one knows.\nThus, the Sage does not move yet knows,\ndoes not see yet names,\ndoes not act yet accomplishes.\nThough the world be vast,\nthe emotions of humanity and the principles of things are but one—\none can know them even without stepping beyond one’s door.\nThough the Dao of the world be subtle,\nthe transformations of yin and yang\nremain constant through the ages—\none can perceive them even without peering through a window.\nIf one must venture forth to seek them,\nthen what one reaches is limited,\nand what one knows is few.\nThe eye’s range is limited,\nand what one sees is few.\nThe more one exerts,\nthe more one’s mind grows dim—\nthus it is said: *the farther one goes, the less one knows*.\nThis is also a metaphor to clarify the following verse.\n\nNot moving yet knowing,\nnot seeking to see yet having a name,\nnot acting yet accomplishing—\nthis is the Sage’s Dao,\nand thus its application.\n\nThe *Yijing* says:\n*\"Swift without haste, arriving without moving.\"*\nThis too conveys the same meaning.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight: Daily Learning Increases**\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine: The Sage’s Heart is Without Fixed Attachment**\n\nTo learn is to daily gain,\nTo cultivate the Dao is to daily lose.\nLose and lose again,\nUntil one reaches *wuwei*—\n*Wuwei*, yet nothing remains undone.\nThus those who take the world\nAlways act with *wuwei*—\nBut once they have *shi*,\nThey are no longer fit to take the world.\n\nTo learn is to daily seek self-benefit,\nTo cultivate the Dao is to daily seek self-loss.\nHence the earlier saying: *“When learning ceases, worries end”*—\nFor the Dao does not lie in perception or hearing.\n\nThe *Dàhuì* states:\n*“The more one reads, the more *wúmíng* one has.”*\nThis too conveys the same meaning.\n\nDiscard cleverness,\nAbandon the body’s strength,\nBanish knowledge and old habits#1—\nThen lose and lose again,\nAnd one may attain *wuwei* and *wuwei* yet nothing undone.\n\nThose who take the world conceal *wuxin*,\nFor those with *xin* will lose it again.\nHow could the Three Dynasties#2 have held the world with *xin*?\n\nUsing the customs of their time—\nWarfare as metaphor—\nTheir words suffice as warning,\nFor this book often holds such meaning.\n\n*Wuwei* and *shi* are the same as *wuxin* and *yǒuxin*.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Sage’s Heart Embodies Life and Death**\n\nLife and death intertwined.\nThose who cling to life—thirteen in ten,\nThose who cling to death—thirteen in ten,\nYet among the people,\nThose who live are thrust into *sǐdì*#3—thirteen in ten.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause of the excess of their *shēngshēng*#4.\n\n**Chapter Fifty: The Art of Nurturing Life**\n\nThose who excel in nurturing life\nWalk the land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without bearing armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no *sǐdì* within them.\n\n*\"Outborn, inborn\"*—these four characters are the chapter’s guiding thread.\nThere is a subtle mystery in the mechanism of life and death:\nWhen one *outborns*, it is to transcend and depart;\nWhen one *inborns*, it is to be lost in confusion.\nOnly those who follow the Dao can *inborn* and then *outborn*.\n\nHeaven has twelve *shén* (constellations),\nThe year has twelve months,\nThe day has twelve *shí* (hours).\nTwelve is the completeness of beginning and end.\nYet when one adds another number to twelve,\nIt becomes thirteen—a clear return to the *yī* (one),\nNot called *yī* but *shísān*,\nThis is the peculiarity of its phrasing,\nSpeaking of how all human life and death originate from this *yī*.\n\n*Yī* is the *jǐ* (precursor).\nIf one cultivates it in accordance with the Dao,\nThen one may attain longevity and enduring vision.\nIf one cultivates it contrary to the Dao,\nThen one will perish with all things.\n\n*\"Tú\"* refers to their kind.\nThe character *yī* is difficult to speak of,\nYet even naming the beginning of a single thought is not precise—\nOne must recognize it within oneself.\n\n*\"The people’s life\"*—those who live in the world,\nTheir tendency toward *sǐdì* lies in the initial impulse of this single thought.\nOnce that impulse is unstable,\nMovement leads directly to *sǐdì*.\n\n*\"Dòng\"* is not the *dòng* of motion and stillness,\nBut the *dòng* of hasty action.\n*\"Zhī\"* means \"to go.\"\n*\"Sǐdì\"* is the place of death.\n*\"Fúhézé?\"*—a rhetorical question.\n\nThese words are the foundation of all ancient and modern cultivation.\nThus, Laozi speaks of them with great care.\n*\"Shēng\"* is what gives rise to me.\n*\"Shēngshēng\"* is how I nurture my life.\nIf nurturing life becomes excessive,\nThen movement leads directly to *sǐdì*.\n\nThis is the meaning of:\nLightening the body to preserve it,\nHaving nothing to possess all,\nBeing empty to attain fullness,\nDiminishing to increase.\n\nNow returning to *\"Guāiwén\"*—\nI have heard of those ancient masters of nurturing life,\nWho, even walking through deep forests, did not meet rhinoceros or tiger,\nAnd, entering battle, were not harmed by armor or weapons—\nBecause they had no *xin*, things could not harm them.\nThe rhinoceros could not gore,\nThe tiger could not maul,\nWeapons could not wound—\nAll because they had no *xin*.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Enter water and it does not wet you,\nEnter fire and it does not burn you.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\n*\"Fúhézé?\"*—another question,\nAsking why things could not harm them—\nBecause they could be empty, could diminish, could be without,\nAnd thus had no *sǐdì*.\n\nThis chapter contains two *\"Fúhézé?\"* questions,\nTheir meaning is profound,\nRevealing Laozi’s profound application.\nIn ancient times, there was a temple with a pond before it,\nWhere a vicious water dragon dwelled—\nNo one dared approach.\nA monk arrived from afar, unaware of it,\nAnd, reaching the pond’s edge, stripped and bathed.\nOnlookers warned him:\n*\"This pond holds a vicious dragon—you must not bathe!\"*\nThe monk replied:\n*\"I have no intent to harm things,\nThings have no intent to harm me.\"*\nHe bathed and emerged unscathed.\nLaozi’s words, though seemingly empty,\nAre proven true by this account.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Gives Birth, Virtue Nourishes**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to it,\nVirtue nurtures it,\nThings shape it,\nCircumstances complete it.\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\n\nThe Dao’s eminence,\nVirtue’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they act naturally.\nThus, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, grows, matures,\nCompletes, ripens, sustains, and shelters.\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nGrowing yet not ruling—\nThis is called *Xuándé* (Mysterious Virtue).\n\nThe Dao is *naturally* without,\nAll things arise from non-being,\nThus, *\"The Dao gives birth to it.\"*\nVirtue, however, has its path,\nThus, *\"Virtue nurtures it.\"*\n*Nurturing* means *having*.\nThings have form,\nThus, *\"Things shape it.\"*\nCircumstances have opposition,\nThus, *\"Circumstances complete it.\"*\nThe interplay of yin and yang,\nThe succession of the four seasons—\nThese are all *circumstances*.\n\n*\"Mò zhī mìng\"*—meaning *\"none command it, yet it acts\"*—\nNot by any deliberate force,\nBut by constant naturalness.\n\n*\"Zūn guì\"*—speaking of their transcendence above all things.\n*\"Mìng\"* is not *\"爵\"* (nobility).\n\n*\"Grow, mature, complete, ripen, sustain, shelter\"*—\nAll speak of the process after birth and possession,\nWhere, within heaven and earth,\nLife endlessly generates—\nAll the work of transformation.\nYet the Creator does not possess what it creates,\nDoes not claim credit for its deeds,\nThough it governs, it has no masterful intent—\nThis is the mystery of *Xuándé*.\n*Xuándé* is the very process of transformation.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of losing the Dao and then virtue;\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao giving birth and virtue nurturing,\nHonoring the Dao and valuing virtue—\nThus, the character *dé* here differs from the previous chapter.\nReaders of *Laozi* must not be so rigid in their distinctions.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Origin of the World**\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich serves as the world’s mother.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nClose its openings,\nShut its gates,\nAnd one’s life will never be exhausted.\nOpen its openings,\nAnd one’s affairs will be completed—\nYet one’s life will never be saved.\n\nSeeing what is small is called *míng* (clarity),\nGuarding what is soft is called *qiáng* (strength).\nUsing its light,\nOne returns to its clarity.\nWithout leaving oneself to calamity,\nThis is called *\"clinging to the constant.\"*\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich serves as the world’s mother—\nThat is, the named mother of all things.\n\nThe world’s mother, **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation),\nThe world’s children, **万物** (*wànwù* / all things).\nKnowing **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation) one then knows **万物** (*wànwù* / all things);\nKnowing **万物** (*wànwù* / all things), one must again know **造化** (*Zàohuà* / Transformation and Creation),\nFor indeed, **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest) cannot give rise to **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest),\nYet **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) arises from **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest).\nThose who know **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) must not fail to know **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest).\n\nTo dwell in **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest) without desire, one beholds its subtleties;\nTo dwell in **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) without desire, one beholds its limits—\nThis is the same intent.\n\n*\"Never in peril\"* (*没身不殆* / *mòshēn bùdài*)\nMeans that in this way, one’s life will never meet with danger or disaster.\n\n**兑** (*duì* / *mouth/opening*), the mouth of man,\nThe **门** (*mén* / *gate*) of a dwelling—\nBoth are metaphors for the source from which all things emerge,\nAs earlier spoken of in the **玄牝** (*Xuán Dàn* / *Mysterious Feminine*).\n\nTo **塞其兑** (*sài qí duì* / *close its mouth/opening*)\nAnd **闭其门** (*bì qí mén* / *shut its gate*)\nIs to conceal **有** (*yǒu* / the Manifest) within **无** (*wu* / the Unmanifest), revealing it not.\n\n*\"Never exhausted\"* (*不勤* / *bùqín*)\nIs to achieve success without labor.\n\nTo **开其兑** (*kāi qí duì* / *open its mouth/opening*)\nIs to emerge and put it to use.\n\n*\"Affairs completed\"* (*济其事* / *jì qí shì*)\nIs to use it while seeking benefit—\n**济** (*jì* / *benefit*) is **益** (*yì* / *gain*).\n\nThus, its peril cannot be saved.\n\nWhat is seen is vast,\nYet when one gathers and makes it small, this is called *至明* (*extreme clarity*).\nWhat is held is rigid,\nYet when one withdraws and guards what is soft, this is called *至强* (*extreme strength*).\nThus, not revealing oneself is *clarity*,\nNot boasting of oneself is *long-lasting* (*strength*).\n\n**光** (*guāng* / *radiance*) is the use of **明** (*míng* / *clarity*);\n**明** (*míng* / *clarity*) is the substance of **光** (*guāng* / *radiance*).\nTo use its **光** (*guāng* / *radiance*) and return it to **明** (*míng* / *clarity*)\nIs to avoid calamity and blame.\n\nKnowing use yet failing to know concealment is the way of incurring disaster.\n**袭** (*xí* / *clinging/preserving*) is **藏** (*cáng* / *concealing*);\n**常** (*cháng* / *constant/eternal*) is **不易** (*bùyì* / *unchangeable*).\n*\"Clinging to the constant\"* (*袭常* / *xícháng*)\nMeans to conceal its use without depletion.\n**常** (*cháng* / *constant*) should not be mistaken for **裳** (*cháng* / *lower garment*)—this is incorrect.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Three: The Unyielding Daoist**\nIf I were steadfast and unyielding,\nTo walk the **大道** (*Dàodào* / *Great Dao/Way*)\nWould be to fear only **施** (*shī* / *excessive giving*).\n\nThe **大道** (*Dàodào* / *Great Dao/Way*) is most level,\nYet people prefer narrow paths.\nThe **朝** (*cháo* / *court*) is most orderly,\nYet fields are left untended,\nGranaries are left empty,\nOrnaments and fine adornments are displayed,\nWeapons of sharp steel are worn,\nFeasts are indulged in,\nWealth is hoarded—\nThis is called **盗夸** (*Dào Kuā* / *robber’s display*).\n\nThis is not the Dao.\n**介然** (*jièrán* / *unyielding*) means firm yet untransforming.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four: The Firmly Established**\nThe firmly established does not uproot,\nThe firmly embracing does not loosen.\nA son and grandson are maintained for sacrifices without interruption.\n\nCultivate it in the body, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes true;\nCultivate it in the family, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes abundant;\nCultivate it in the village, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes enduring;\nCultivate it in the state, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes flourishing;\nCultivate it in the world, and its **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) becomes universal.\n\nThus, observe the body with the body,\nObserve the family with the family,\nObserve the village with the village,\nObserve the state with the state,\nObserve the world with the world.\n\nHow do I know the world’s thusness?\nBy this.\n\nThe firmly established is ever uprooted,\nThe firmly embracing is ever loosened—\nUnless **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) is firmly established\nAnd **朴** (*pǔ* / *primordial simplicity*) is firmly embraced,\nThen it shall neither uproot nor loosen.\n\nA family with sons and grandsons\nMust never cease its sacrifices.\n\nThe **Dao/Way** generates **一** (*yī* / *oneness*), **一** (*yī* / *oneness*) generates **二** (*èr* / *twoness*), **二** (*èr* / *twoness*) does not generate **三** (*sān* / *threeness*), and **三** (*sān* / *threeness*) generates the myriad things.\nGeneration follows generation without end—\nJust as sons and grandsons inherit a family.\n\nThese three sentences are all analogies,\nSpeaking of how the **Dao/Way**, though seemingly nonexistent, truly endures.\n\nCultivate it in the body, and it is real without deceit;\nCultivate it in the family, and it accumulates with lasting blessings;\nCultivate it in the village, and it earns the village’s reverence;\nCultivate it in the state, and its influence grows ever greater;\nCultivate it in the world, and its reach extends ever farther.\n\n**長** (*cháng* / *enduring*) means revered,\n**豐** (*fēng* / *flourishing*) means abundant,\n**普** (*pǔ* / *universal*) means far-reaching.\n\nFrom my own body, I can observe others’ bodies,\nFrom my own family, I can observe others’ families,\nFrom my own village, I can observe others’ villages—\nExtending this to states and the world applies equally.\nThis is the **Dao/Way**’s uniform principle.\n\nBy this, the **Dao/Way** is known.\nObserving through the **Dao/Way**,\nThe world has no contrary.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Profound Embrace of Virtue/Power**\nThe profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)\nIs seen in the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft,\nThe grasp is firm.\nThough unaware of male and female union,\nThe **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—\nThis is the peak of **精** (*jīng* / *essence*).\n\nAll day it cries yet its throat never grows hoarse,\nThis is the peak of **和** (*hé* / *harmony*).\n\nKnowing **和** (*hé* / *harmony*) is **常** (*cháng* / *constant*),\nKnowing **常** (*cháng* / *constant*) is **明** (*míng* / *clarity*),\nAdding to life is **祥** (*xiáng* / *omen*),\nForcing the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) with the heart is **強** (*qiáng* / *force*).\n\nWhen things grow robust, they grow old—\nThis is called **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),\nAnd **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*) perishes early.\n\nThe profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)\nIs the concealment and nurturing without display.\n**厚** (*hòu* / *profound*) means **至** (*zhì* / *ultimate*).\n\nWhen the embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) reaches its ultimate,\nIt is like the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nSnatching birds do not clutch—\nThis means things cannot harm it,\nJust as entering water does not wet it,\nAnd entering fire does not burn it.\n\nThe **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s bones are most frail,\nIts sinews most tender,\nYet its grip is unyielding.\n\nThough unaware of male and female union,\nIts **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—\nIts **精** (*jīng* / *essence*) is abundant.\n\n**命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s original **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*).\n\nThough it cries all day,\nIts throat never grows hoarse—\nIts heart knows no joy nor anger,\nIts **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) is naturally harmonious.\n\nThe throat is the **咽喉** (*yànhóu* / *pharynx/larynx*),\nHoarseness is **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) obstruction.\n\nThe **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*) is pure, singular, and unyielding,\nThus it can be so.\nThe **有道者** (*yǒudàozhě* / *Daoist*) is the same—\nOnly the heart does not move.\n\n**和** (*hé* / *harmony*) is the preservation of pure **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).\nKnowing this ultimate harmony,\nOne can endure constantly without change.\nKnowing this constant endurance,\nOne can be said to be **明** (*míng* / *clear*) in the **Dao/Way**.\n\nLife cannot be artificially enhanced,\nForcing such enhancement brings misfortune.\n**祥** (*xiáng* / *omen*) is **妖** (*yāo* / *unnatural/portentous*).\nThus, it is said: *Adding to life is an omen.*\n\nThe **心** (*xīn* / *heart*) forces the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*)—\nThis is **志** (*zhì* / *aspiration*) moving the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).\n**強** (*qiáng* / *force*) means **暴** (*bào* / *brutality*).\nBrutality is **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),\nThus, it is said: *Forcing the qi with the heart is force.*\n\nBy this as force,\nNothing remains unbroken—\nLike things growing robust,\nNothing remains unaging.\nThis is not called the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**早已** (*zǎoyǐ* / *early cessation*)—\nStop quickly and do not act.\n**已** (*yǐ* / *cessation*) means **止** (*zhǐ* / *halt*).\nThese three lines have already appeared in **Chapter Thirty**.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Six: The Silent Sage**\nThe knowing do not speak,\nThe speaking do not know.\n\nPlug its **兑** (*duì* / *mouth/joy*), close its **门** (*mén* / *gate*),\nDull its sharpness, untangle its confusion,\nHarmonize its brightness, equalize its dust—\nThis is called **玄同** (*Xuándōng* / *Mysterious Oneness*).\n\nIt cannot be drawn near as intimate,\nNor pushed away as distant;\nIt cannot be claimed as beneficial,\nNor rejected as harmful.\n\n「It cannot be esteemed as **noble** (*guì* / *honor*), nor despised as **base** (*jiàn* / *lowly*), hence it is **noble** for all under heaven.\nThe knowing do not speak, the speaking do not know—\nThis is said to mean the **Dao/Way** cannot be confined by words.\n\nAgain, plug its **兑** (*duì* / *mouth/joy*), close its **门** (*mén* / *gate*),\nAnd conceal it in **密** (*mì* / *secrecy*).\nIt must dull its sharpness and **磨砻** (*móli* / *grind and polish it*),\nSo that it has no **圭角** (*guījiǎo* / *principled edges*).\nIt must untangle its **纷** (*fēn* / *chaos*) and **条理** (*tiáolǐ* / *order it*),\nSo that it does not **紊乱** (*wǎnluàn* / *be disordered*).\nIt must harmonize its brightness and equalize its dust—\nYet not **自眩露** (*zìxiànlù* / *self-aggrandize*).\nThis is called the **至玄** (*Zhìxuán* / *Supreme Mystery*),\nThe **至妙** (*Zhìmiào* / *Supreme Marvelousness*),\nAnd the **同然而然** (*Tóngrán’rán* / *Oneness with natural spontaneity*) of **理** (*lǐ* / *principle*).\n\nWith this **Mysterious Oneness** of the **Dao/Way**,\nAll under heaven cannot be drawn near as intimate,\nNor pushed away as distant—\nThis is to say it transcends the bounds of near and far.\nHence, this is why the **Dao/Way** is **noble** for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven: Governing with Rectitude**\nGoverning with **rectitude** (*zhèng* / *uprightness, correctness*),\nEmploying **奇** (*qí* / *strategic guile, extraordinary tactics*) in warfare,\nAnd seizing all under heaven through **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*).\nHow do I know this to be so?\nBy this.\n\nFor when all under heaven abounds in **忌讳** (*jìhuì* / *taboos and prohibitions*),\nThe people grow ever more **贫** (*pín* / *impoverished*).\nWhen men proliferate **利器** (*lìqì* / *sharp/advantageous tools*),\nThe state becomes ever more **昏** (*hūn* / *corrupt, chaotic*).\nWhen the people abound in **技巧** (*jìqiǎo* / *skills and craftiness*),\n**奇物** (*qíwù* / *strange/artificial things*) proliferate.\nWhen **法令** (*fǎlìng* / *laws and decrees*) become ever more **彰** (*zhāng* / *prominent, explicit*),\nThieves and robbers abound.\nTherefore, the **圣人** (*shèngrén* / *Sage*) says:\n*\"I act with **无为** (*wúwéi* / *non-action*), yet the people transform themselves.\nI love **静** (*jìng* / *tranquility*), yet the people rectify themselves.\nI act with **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*), yet the people grow rich.\nI have **无欲** (*wúyù* / *no desires*), yet the people return to **朴** (*pǔ* / *simplicity, naturalness*).\"*\n\nGoverning with **rectitude** means\nThat when governing the state, one must have **政事** (*zhèngshì* / *government affairs*).\nEmploying **奇** in warfare means\nThat when waging war, one must rely on **诈术** (*zhàshù* / *deceitful strategies*).\nBoth of these are acts of **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*).\n**无为** while still **为** (*wúwéi ér wéi* / *non-acting yet acting*),\nThen one can attain the **心** (*xīn* / *loyalty*) of all under heaven—\nHence it is said: *\"Seize all under heaven through **无事** (*wúshì* / *non-action*).\"*\n\nHow do I know that **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*) is not acceptable,\nYet **无心** (*wúxīn* / *non-intent*) is?\nBy this **Dao/Way**.\n\n「Taboos and prohibitions are a means of restraint.\n**利器** (*lìqì* / *sharp/useful tools*) are for the practical convenience of the world.\n**技巧** (*jìqiǎo* / *crafty skills*) are the artistry of artisans.\n**奇物** (*qíwù* / *ingenious devices*)—such as the *juéjiāng* (shaduf) and mechanical contrivances—are of this kind.\nOnce **机心** (*jīxīn* / *scheming intent*) prevails,\n**机事** (*jīshì* / *scheming undertakings*) multiply evermore.\nThus, the clearer the laws and decrees,\nThe more rampant the thieves and bandits become.\nThis illustrates the harm of **有心** (*yǒuxīn* / *deliberate intent*), all metaphorical speech.\n\nHence, the ancient **圣人** (*Shèngrén* / *Sages*) merely say:\n*\"Non-acting yet acting, preferring tranquility,\nNon-action and no desires—\nAnd all under heaven will govern itself.\"*\n\nThe Sage speaks again in the following chapter.\n*\"The chapter of **其政闷闷** (*qízhèng mènmèn* / *its governance is obscure and harmonious*)\"*—the fifty-eighth:\n\n*\"Its governance is obscure and harmonious, its people are pure and content;\nIts governance is meticulous and probing, its people are deficient and restless.\nDisaster, oh, where fortune leans;\nFortune, oh, where disaster lurks.\nWho knows their ultimate end,\nThat neither **正** (*zhèng* / *rectitude*) nor **邪** (*xié* / *crookedness*) can be fixed?\nRectitude may turn to **奇** (*qí* / *deceit*), goodness may turn to **妖** (*yāo* / *bewitching*).\nThe people’s confusion has long been set in motion.\nTherefore, the Sage is square yet not sharp-edged,\nModerate yet not piercing,\nUpright yet not overbearing,\nBrilliant yet not dazzling.\n\n**闷闷** (*mènmèn* / *obscure and harmonious*) means not to feign cleverness.\n**察察** (*cháchá* / *meticulous and probing*) means excessive scrutiny and fragmentation.\n**醇醇** (*chúnchún* / *pure and content*) is self-satisfaction.\n**缺缺** (*quēquē* / *deficient and restless*) is lack and discontent.\nThis too conveys the meaning:\nThat **有心** (*deliberate intent*) brings harm,\nWhile **无心** (*non-intent*) brings self-governance.\n\nDisaster and fortune are without constancy,\nAlternating in their reliance and concealment—\nWho knows where their limits lie?\n**正** (*zhèng* / *rectitude*) is constancy.\nYet what if there is no constancy?\nIt means that their reliance and concealment are endless,\nAnd cannot be determined.\n\nThe affairs of all under heaven:\n**奇** (*qí* / *deceit*) may become **正** (*rectitude*), **正** may become **奇**,\nGoodness may become **妖** (*bewitching*), **妖** may become goodness—\nRight and wrong, benefit and harm,\nAll are thus in constant flux.\nThis too is the meaning of disaster and fortune alternating.\n\nThe people are confused and do not realize,\nOnly blindly distinguishing between **奇** and **正**, between **妖** and goodness.\nTheir confusion is not of a single day’s making.\n\nOnly the Sage’s **Dao/Way** is thus:\nThough square, it has no corners,\nThough moderate, it does not pierce,\nThough upright, it cannot be stretched,\nThough brilliant, its radiance is not seen.\n**割** (*gē* / *to cut/trim*), **削** (*xuē* / *to pare*)—without corners, there is nothing to trim.\n**廉** (*lián* / *sharpness, edge*), the sharpness of distant lands—\nNot to pierce means not to harm; sharpness and utility easily lead to injury.\n**肆** (*sì* / *to extend*), **伸** (*shēn* / *to stretch*)—\nNot to stretch means its uprightness is not apparent.\n**耀** (*yào* / *to dazzle*), the flame of brilliance—\nThis is the meaning of concealing within the act of non-concealment.\n\n*\"The chapter of **治人事天** (*zhìrén shìtiān* / *governing people and serving the Dao/Way*)\"*—the fifty-ninth:\n\n*\"To govern people and serve the Dao/Way,\nNothing surpasses **啬** (*sè* / *frugality, restraint*).\"*\n\n---\n\n*\"Now, **frugality** (*sè*) is the very reason for **early return** (*zǎo fù*), and **early return** is called **accumulating virtue/power** (*chóng jī dé*). To accumulate virtue/power means nothing cannot be overcome; nothing cannot be overcome means none can fathom its limits, and if none can fathom its limits, one can establish a state. The foundation of establishing a state, one can endure long and prosper. This is called the **Dao/Way of deep-rooted and firmly grounded** (*shēn gēn gù dì*) **enduring life and long vision** (*cháng shēng jiǔ shì*).\n\nThe **frugal** (*sè*) one holds **abundance without exhaustion** (*yǒu yú bù jìn yòng zhī yì*). Thus, they can **possess without holding** (*néng yǒu ér wú*), **be solid yet appear empty** (*néng shí ér xū*), making it fitting that they can **govern people** (*lián rén*) and **serve the Dao/Way** (*shì tiān*). **Early return** (*zǎo fù*) means **reverting to the root** (*guī fù yú gēn*). **Limit** (*jí*) is **early** (*zǎo*), **early** is **not distant** (*bù yuǎn*). **Return** (*fù*) is **reverting to the origin and restoring the fundamental** (*fǎn běn huán yuán*). When virtue/power reaches this stage, it grows ever more abundant and flourishing. **Accumulating** (*chóng*) means **ever-increasing accumulation** (*yù jī zhī yì*). **Overcome** (*kè*) means **capability** (*néng*). The more virtue/power flourishes, the more nothing is impossible in its application. If none can fathom its limits, it means **exhaustless use** (*yòng zhī bù qióng*). Exhaustless use means one can **establish a state** (*wéi guó*) and endure long.\n\n**Foundation** (*mǔ*) means **nurturing** (*yǎng*). To nurture people with goodness is to **rule the world** (*fú tiānxià*). Thus, it is for **governing the state** (*zhì guó*), and likewise for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*). If one can nurture life with **harmony** (*yīn*), then they can **deepen its roots** (*shēn qí gēn*), **ground its foundation** (*gù qí dì*), achieve **enduring life** (*cháng shēng*), and attain **long vision** (*jiǔ shì*). **Roots and foundation** (*gēn dì*) are the **source of primordial qi** (*yuán qì zhī mǔ*). **Long vision** (*jiǔ shì*) means **unfaltering spirit** (*jīngshén quán kě jiǔ shì ér bù shùn*).\n\nNow, those who **cultivate qi** (*fú qì*) may possess such techniques, though not the learning of **Laozi** (*Lǎozi*), yet they can **verify the words of Laozi** (*kě yàn Lǎozi zhī yán*). This chapter uses **governing the state** (*zhì guó*) as an analogy for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*).\n\n---\n*\"The chapter of **governing a great state** (*zhì dà guó*)—the sixtieth:*\n\n**Governing a great state** is like **poaching a small fish** (*rú pēng xiǎo xiān*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), its **spirits** (*guǐ*) are not **divine** (*shén*). Not that its spirits are not divine, but that the divine does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) also does not harm. Both **not harming each other** (*liǎng bù xiāng shāng*), thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*dé jiāo guī fǎn*).\n\nThis chapter first **emphatically states** (*xiān dùn yī jù*) a sentence, to express the meaning of **not disturbing** (*ān jìng bù rǎo*). **Poaching a small fish** means **stirring it breaks** (*jiǎo zhī zé suì*). For **governing the state**, **disturbing it causes chaos** (*rǎo zhī zé luàn*). **Purity, tranquility, and non-action** (*qīngjìng wúwéi, ānjìng bùrǎo*), this is the **Dao/Way of governing the state** (*zhì guó zhī Dào*).\n\nHaving introduced this meaning in the first sentence, the following discusses the **Dao/Way of the Three Talents** (*sān cái zhī Dào*), all of which revolve around **not disturbing** (*bù rǎo*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), this **world** (*tiānxià*) encompasses the **Three Talents** (*sān cái*). All beneath the **Great Void** (*Tài xū*), governed by the **Dao/Way**, the **Heaven** (*tiān*) fulfills its role of **covering** (*fù*), the **Earth** (*dì*) fulfills its role of **bearing** (*zài*), and the **Sage** fulfills their role of **teaching** (*jiào*). The three each fulfill their duties without encroaching upon one another, thus all attain their **Dao/Way** (*dé qí Dào*).\n\n**Spirits** (*shén*) are **yang** (*yáng*); **ghosts** (*guǐ*) are **yin** (*yīn*). Though it does not say **yin-yang** (*yīn yáng*) but **spirits and ghosts** (*shén guǐ*), this aligns with the **authentic intent of the text’s composition** (*zhèng qí zhuó shū lì zhī yì*), not desiring full revelation. When it says **its ghosts are not divine** (*qí guǐ bù shén*), it means the **Earth** abides by **yin** yet does not interfere with **yang**. Not that its ghosts are not divine, but that the **divine** (*shén*) of the **Heaven** does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Earth** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*dì jìn dì zhī Dào*) without interfering with **Heaven**, while **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*tiān jìn tiān zhī Dào*) without interfering with people, hence it is said **the divine does not harm people** (*qí shén bù shāng rén*).\n\nNot that the divine does not harm people, but that **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** without interfering with people; the **Sage** also exhausts their own **Dao/Way** without interfering with **Heaven and Earth**. The **mysterious** (*yōu*) becomes **yin-yang**, the **manifest** (*míng*) becomes **Sage and governance** (*shèng zhì*). These two do not harm each other, thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*).\n\nIt is said that **Heaven and Earth attain the natural Dao/Way** (*tiān dì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), the **Sage** also attains the natural **Dao/Way** (*shèngrén yì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), each possessing their own virtue/power without encroaching, hence it is said **virtue/power returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*). **Not harming each other** (*bù xiāng shāng*) means **not encroaching** (*bù xiāng qīn*), and the **Sage** also does not harm. The following line mistakenly adds an extra **people** (*mín*) character—an error. The **Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Dao/Way** (*Dàodé Zhēn Jīng Kǒuyì*) concludes here in the third volume.\n\n---\n*#1: Original reads **\"誉\"** (*yù*), corrected according to the **shadow-printed Song edition** (*yǐng sòng běn*).\n#2: Original reads **\"所地\"** (*suǒ dì*), corrected according to the **shadow-printed Song edition** (*yǐng sòng běn*).*\n\n**Chapter 61: The Great State as the Lowly Stream**\n\nThe great state is the lowly stream of the world,\nthe meeting place of all under Heaven,\nthe receptive mother of all under Heaven.\n\nThe receptive always overcomes the assertive by stillness,\nand stillness is the way of the lowly.\n\nThus, when the great state yields to the small state, it takes the small state;\nwhen the small state yields to the great state, it takes the great state.\nHence, sometimes yielding brings conquest,\nsometimes yielding brings possession.\n\nThe great state seeks only to nurture all people,\nthe small state seeks only to serve others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nthe great state ought to be lowly.\n\nThis chapter uses the great and small states attaining their desires\nto illustrate that those who know the Dao should be humble and still—\nnot teaching that one should yield to gain victory.\n\nSince the Three Dynasties onward, there have been instances of states taking others,\nthis metaphor is drawn from what was observed.\n\n*\"Lowly stream\"* means to place oneself in humility.\nIf the people of the great state can humble themselves,\nthey can unite the world’s alliances,\njust as the receptive overcomes the assertive through stillness.\n\nThose who yield take stillness as their Dao,\nhence it is said, *\"stillness is the way of the lowly.\"*\n\n*\"Taking by yielding\"* and *\"possessing by yielding\"*—\nthese two phrases are also uniquely expressed.\n\nThe intent of the great state is merely to nurture all people for strength,\nwhile the small state seeks only to carve and inscribe itself into others.\nBoth must yield to achieve their desires,\nand only by yielding can both attain what they seek.\n\nThus, those who know the Dao must indeed find humility fitting.\n\nThis sentence concludes the chapter,\nits meaning simply that the strong must become weak,\nthe possessing must become empty—\nonly then do they know the Dao.\n\nThe entire book’s intent is thus expressed in every chapter,\nyet commentators often mistake the metaphors for literal instruction,\nwhich is why Master Huī’ān criticized Laozi’s doctrine of laborious exertion.\n\nOnly Master Huáng Màocái’s interpretation states:\n*\"This entire chapter is a metaphor illustrating the Dao.\"*\nThis is most accurate,\nthough it cannot be universally applied to other chapters,\nand thus has its limitations.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 62: The Dao as the Hidden Mystery of All Things**\n\nThe Dao is the hidden mystery of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n\nFine words can be sold in the marketplace,\nnoble conduct can elevate one above others.\nHow could one abandon those who are unvirtuous?\nThus, when establishing a Son of Heaven or appointing the Three Ministers,\neven if one offers a jade tablet before fine steeds,\nit is not as good as humbly presenting this Dao.\n\nWhy did the ancients hold this Dao in such esteem?\nWas it not because seeking it brings attainment,\nand virtue can avert guilt?\n\nThus, it is the most precious under Heaven.\n\n*\"The Dao is the hidden mystery of all things\"*—\nthis opening line praises it.\n\nWhat follows speaks of the Dao being present in all under Heaven,\nin both the wise and the foolish.\nFor the virtuous, those who know the Dao cherish and treasure it.\nFor the unvirtuous, those who know the Dao also shelter and embrace them.\nThis is the meaning of *\"nurturing the unbalanced with the balanced.\"*\n\n*\"Marketplace\"* refers to transactions where people exchange goods for mutual benefit,\nyet even here, fine words can bring delight.\nIf a village has even one person worthy of respect,\nothers will naturally honor and elevate them.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that this inherent goodness\nis never absent from the world.\n\nThen, how could those who know the Dao abandon the unvirtuous?\n*\"Fine words can be sold\"*—*\"sold\"* here means self-promotion,\nas when apothecaries advertise *\"no deception, broad benevolence.\"*\n*\"Noble conduct can elevate one above others\"*—\nin villages, whether one is long-suffering or kind,\ntheir neighbors will not fail to honor them.\n\nThese two lines mean even ordinary people\ndo not fail to recognize the Dao’s goodness.\n\n*\"Offering a jade tablet before fine steeds\"*—\nthis is the ritual for recruiting the worthy.\nWith humble words and generous gifts to seek the virtuous,\nand place them in the Three Ministerial ranks,\nit is still not as good as humbly presenting this Dao.\n\nMoreover, why did the ancients value this Dao so highly?\nSeeking it brings attainment—\nthe Dao lies within oneself; virtue depends on oneself, not others.\nEven those with guilt can be pardoned by a single virtuous thought.\nEven the wicked, through fasting, bathing, and ritual purity,\ncan serve the Divine.\n\n*\"Was it not because...\"*—\nas if to say, *\"Does not the Classic of Poetry not say...\"*\nThe Dao is not limited to the wise or foolish;\nenlightenment brings attainment—\nthis is why it is so precious under Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 63: Acting Without Acting**\n\nAct without acting,\ndo without doing,\ntaste without tasting.\n\nGreat and small, many and few.\nRepay resentment with virtue.\nPlan the difficult while it is easy,\nachieve the great while it is small.\n\nThe world’s difficult tasks must begin with ease,\nthe world’s great tasks must begin with minutiae.\nThus, the Sage never acts with grandiosity,\nand so achieves the great.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany easy tasks bring many difficulties.\nThus, the Sage treats even these with caution,\nand so never faces true difficulty.\n\nOnly by *not* acting can one achieve *all* things,\nhence it is said, *\"Act without acting.\"*\n\nOnly by *not* doing in doing can one gather true accomplishment,\nhence it is said, *\"Do without doing.\"*\n\nOnly by *not* clinging to taste can one truly know flavor,\nhence it is said, *\"Taste without tasting.\"*\n\nThose who can achieve the great must also achieve the small,\nthose who can achieve the many must also achieve the few,\nthose who repay resentment must do so with virtue,\nthose who plan the difficult must first address the easy,\nthose who achieve the great must first address the minute.\n\nFrom *\"taste without tasting\"* onward, these are all metaphors.\n\n*\"Difficult tasks must begin with ease, great tasks with minutiae\"*—\nthis merely elaborates the preceding intent.\n\nThe Sage does not exalt themselves,\nyet through humility and lowliness,\nthey achieve the great.\n\nThose who make light promises often overcommit,\nleading to broken trust.\nThose who treat tasks as easy often find them difficult to complete.\nThus, the Sage treats even these with caution,\nand so never faces true difficulty.\n\n---\n\nThis is also a metaphorical expression, but by adding the word *\"husband\"* (夫), its meaning shifts again.\nEarlier, it spoke of *\"ease\"* (易), lest people regard it with a casual or frivolous mindset.\nThus, it turns the phrase to say *\"easy\"* (易), not meaning *\"light\"* or *\"frivolous\"* (轻易).\nThe Sage still treats matters as if they were difficult,\nand so never encounters true difficulty—what of others?\n\nThe intent here is that *\"ease\"* (易) refers to effortless action,\nnot to what is casually or lightly undertaken.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four: The Ease of Non-Action**\nWhen it is yet tranquil, it is easy to hold;\nWhen its signs are not yet evident, it is easy to plan;\nWhen it is yet fragile, it is easy to break;\nWhen it is yet subtle, it is easy to disperse.\n\nAct before things manifest,\ngovern before chaos arises.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace grows from a tiny sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower begins with a single basket of earth;\nA journey of a thousand *li* starts beneath one’s feet.\n\nDoers bring ruin,\nGraspers lose their hold.\n\nThe Sage does not act,\nThus there is no ruin;\nThe Sage does not grasp,\nThus there is no loss.\n\nWhen the people undertake tasks,\nThey often falter just as success is near.\nIf one treats the end with the same care as the beginning,\nThere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nThus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,\nAnd does not value what others prize as rare.\nThey learn without learning,\nAnd correct what others overlook—\nTo aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet they dare not act.\n\nIn times of peace, it is easy to hold firm;\nWhen danger comes, it is hard to maintain.\n\nBefore a matter sprouts, it is easy to plan;\nOnce it takes shape, it is hard to strategize.\n\nWhen it is still fragile, it is easy to shatter;\nOnce it has hardened, it is hard to attack.\n\nWhen its path is yet faint, it is easy to disperse;\nWhen it flourishes, it is hard to scatter.\n\nAct before things exist,\nGovern before chaos arises.\n\nA tree thick enough to embrace—\nIts growth begins from the smallest sprout;\nA nine-tiered tower—\nIts construction starts with a single basket of earth;\nA thousand-*li* journey—\nIt begins with the first step.\n\nAll these points speak of those who study the Dao\nMust know the critical moment (*jī* 几).\nThis *jī* 几 has both refined and coarse aspects—\nThe thirteenth of a month is also *jī* 几,\nThe beginning before beginnings is also *jī* 几,\nThe natural state of things is also *jī* 几.\n\nYet when one acts or clings,\nSigns become evident—\nThus it is said: *\"Doers bring ruin, graspers lose their hold.\"*\n\nThe Sage acts by not acting,\nClings by not clinging—\nThus they know no ruin, no loss.\n\nOrdinary people, in their dealings with this world,\nHave tasks that hold promise of success,\nYet they ruin them—\nThey do not perceive the critical moment (*jī* 几),\nBut fixate on its outward traces.\n\nIf one does not seek the end of a matter,\nBut instead exercises caution at its beginning,\nThere will be no ruined undertakings.\n\nWhat others do not desire,\nThe Sage desires;\nWhat others prize as rare,\nThe Sage does not prize.\n\nHard-to-obtain treasures are but metaphorical speech.\nWhat the multitude does not study, the Sage studies;\nWhat the multitude passes by without heeding, the Sage turns back to examine.\n*Fu* 复 is *fan* 反—this too is metaphorical speech.\n\nThe Sage acts thus in all things,\nWith a heart that dares not act,\nOnly then can they assist the natural unfolding of all things.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Masters of the Dao**\nThe ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,\nBut rather to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\nTo govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nTo govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two principles is the model.\nTo know this model is called *Xuan De* 玄德—\nProfound and distant, contrary to things, yet reaching *Da Shun* 大顺.\n\nKeen intelligence is a burden of the Dao.\nThe Sage’s teaching of others always seeks to dim their brilliance,\nLest they burden themselves—\nThus it is said: *\"Not to enlighten the people, but to make them simple.\"*\n\nThe character *yu* 愚 is ill-placed here—\nQin’s deception of the common folk stems from this error.\nHence, Master Hui’s critique of it as *lao rang* 劳攘.\n\nWhen cleverness and skill abound, the people grow harder to govern.\nThus, governing with cleverness becomes the state’s undoing.\nFor when rulers and subjects alike rely on cunning,\nChaos takes root—\nHence: *\"To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nTo govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\"*\n\nThese two refer to wisdom and its absence.\nTo know that cleverness is ruinous and simplicity is blessing—\nThis too can serve as a law for the world.\nTo grasp this law is to possess *Xuan Miao* 玄妙’s virtue.\n\n*\"Profound and distant\"*—words of exaggerated praise.\n*Fan* 反 is *fu* 复—\nTo reverse and restore with all things, seeking their origin,\nIs to return to *Da Shun*, the great harmony—\n*Harmony* being *naturalness* itself.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys**\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in humility—\nThus they reign as kings of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who would lead the people\nMust speak to them in humility;\nWho would go before the people\nMust place themselves last.\n\nThus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not feel burdened,\nGoes before yet the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nBecause they do not contend,\nNone under heaven can contend with them.\n\nAll valley waters converge at the rivers and seas.\nThough the rivers and seas are exalted over all valleys,\nThey dwell beneath them—\nThis is a metaphor drawn from things.\nThe self-humiliated are exalted by others,\nThe self-last are honored as first.\n\nTo speak in humility—\nAs when one says, *\"Even a foolish man and woman can surpass me.\"*\nTo place oneself last—\nAs when one defers to the multitude, following others.\n\nThe Sage does not boast of leading the people,\nNor does He seek to go before them—\nRather, this is His way.\n\nThe intent is: Even the Sage, though desiring to lead and go first,\nStill acts thus—\nHow much more so others?\nThe phrasing is slightly exaggerated in its emphasis.\n\nThough the Sage stands above all under heaven,\nThe people do not feel oppressed.\nThough He goes before all under heaven,\nThe people do not feel harmed.\nAll under heaven gladly follow without weariness,\nFor the Sage follows the Way of non-contention—\nThus none under heaven can contend with Him.\n\n*\"Not burdened\"* means *\"not weary\"*—\nThree *\"is with\"* clauses, as in the *Systematic Classic*’s repeated *\"is because.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: All Under Heaven Speaks**\nAll under heaven says, *\"He is great yet seems unworthy.\"*\nOnly because He is great does He seem unworthy.\nIf He were worthy for long, He would be petty.\n\nI possess three treasures—treasures to hold:\nFirst, *ci* 慈—compassion;\nSecond, *jian* 俭—frugality;\nThird, *not daring to lead all under heaven.*\n\nCompassion makes one courageous,\nFrugality makes one expansive,\nNot daring to lead all under heaven makes one the vessel and leader.\n\nNow, abandon compassion yet cling to courage,\nAbandon frugality yet cling to expansion,\nAbandon lastness yet cling to first—\nThis is death.\n\nCompassion in war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security.\nWhen Heaven would save them, it shields them with compassion.\n\n*\"Great yet seems unworthy\"*—this was a saying of the time,\nThus Laozi cites it as metaphor, echoing the earlier *\"barren valleys, orphans, widows.\"*\n\n*\"All under heaven says\"*—meaning this was a common phrase of the age.\n\nOnly because He is *great* does He seem unworthy—\nThe most exalted must act with the most humble heart.\n*Xiao* 肖 is *xiang* 象—\nSeemingly without likeness, yet embodying the small.\n\nIf one fancies themselves likened to anything,\nThey are petty, not of great measure.\n\nThese two lines clarify Laozi’s intent through contemporary speech.\nOne manuscript adds *\"dao\"* 道 after *\"predicates me\"* and *\"also\"* 也 after *\"petty,\"*—both errors.\n\nThe *three treasures*—their Way is precious and to be employed.\n*\"I possess\"*—what is noble in oneself.\nOnly compassion makes one courageous,\nOnly frugality makes one expansive,\nOnly not daring to lead makes one the leader of all under heaven.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"The Duke of Jin was expansive yet frugal.\"*\nThis directly applies the phrase.\n\n*Lian* 涟 is to gather the enemy,\n*Guang* 广 is to open and unfettered—\nAlso the meaning of *\"smallness precedes greatness.\"*\n\n*Qi* 器 is form—*cheng qi* 成器 is to take form.\nAll formed things on earth, I make their leader—\nThus: *\"to make form and lead.\"*\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion yet uses courage,\nAbandons frugality yet uses expansion,\nAbandons lastness yet uses first—\nThis is not the way to preserve oneself—\nThus: *\"Death.\"*\n\n*War* is to engage and move—\nAs Zhuangzi says: *\"To clash and contend, daily battling with the heart.\"*\n*Defense* is as Zhuangzi’s *\"pure qi guarding.\"*\nIf one takes compassion as master,\nExternally they can overcome things,\nInternally they can guard themselves—\nThus: *\"In war, they win; in defense, they hold firm.\"*\n\n「Rescue, *yòu* 佑 is to assist and protect.\nDefense, *wèi* 卫 is to guard oneself.\nIf one defends with compassion, Heaven aids them.\nThis language is subtle, bearing a rebuke for those today who cannot [do so].\n\nThe capable are guided by Heaven’s *zhōng* 诱#2 [intuition],\nWhile the incapable are deprived of Heaven’s oversight.\n\nEarlier, the Three Treasures were mentioned—here, one [treasure] is raised:\nIf one is compassionate, the other two are inherent within.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**\nThe virtuous warrior is not martial,\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nThe skilled victor does not contend,\nThe skilled leader places others *below* them.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThis is called the *strength of using others*,\nThis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ancient pinnacle.\n\n*Shì* 士 are officers of the *shīshī* 士师 [ritual masters].\n*Wǔ* 武 means \"vigorous officials.\"\nTo establish *shì* with clear laws—why employ martial vigor?\nTo fight while enraged is to provoke the soldiers.\n\"Not to contend\" means not to oppose things directly.\nTo \"place others below\" echoes the earlier meaning of \"taking from the lowly to enrich the state.\"\n\nThe excellence of these four lies in the metaphor of non-contention.\nThe *virtue of non-contention* can harmonize with Heaven,\nCan bend collective strength to govern the world—\nFrom ancient times, nothing surpasses this, hence: *\"the ancient pinnacle.\"*\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War’s Sayings**\nThe art of war has sayings:\n*\"I dare not take the offensive but yield the initiative,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called *\"moving without moving,\"*\n*\"Seizing without arms,\"*\n*\"Defeating without resistance,\"*\n*\"Grasping without weapons.\"*\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s Treasures.\nThus, when armies clash, the first to engage wins.\n\nThose who speak of war’s art also cite contemporary sayings as metaphor.\nThe warrior does not dare take the offensive but yields the initiative,\nValues retreat over advance,\nMakes \"non-action\" into action,\nMakes \"non-seizing\" into seizing,\nMakes \"no resistance\" into resistance,\nMakes \"no weapons\" into weapons—\nAll are stratagems of feigning cowardice and weakness to deceive the enemy.\n\n*Rén* 仍 means \"to lure\"—to lure the enemy into battle.\nThus, such warfare holds the path to victory.\nIf one underestimates the enemy in arrogance, defeat is inevitable.\nNon-contention preserves the Treasures,\nBut underestimating the enemy to seek victory loses them.\n\nThus, when two warring states clash,\nThe side that *pities* (哀) always prevails.\n*Pity* means solemnly not rejoicing in war.\nDrums clash, soldiers leap into battle—\nThis is not *pity*.\n\nThis chapter entirely uses warfare to illustrate the *Dao*.\nBy extension, all such metaphors in the text follow this pattern.\n\n**Chapter 70: My Words Are Most Obvious**\nMy words are most obvious, most easy to act upon.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can follow them.\nSpeech has its *master* (宗),\nAffairs have their *lord* (君).\n\nOnly the ignorant fail to recognize me.\nFew know me, so I am honored.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade.\n\nMy words are most obvious, most easy to act upon,\nYet none in the world knows or follows them—\nThis is the world’s deception in not recognizing itself.\n\n*Zōng* 宗 is \"master,\" *jūn* 君 is also \"lord.\"\nAmong all speech, some words are supreme—hence, *\"speech has its master.\"*\nAll affairs under Heaven are governed by the *Dao*—hence, *\"affairs have their lord.\"*\n\nSince the world lacks those who know supreme speech and the *Dao*,\nNone recognize me—hence, *\"Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.\"*\nHaving said the world does not know me,\nYet *\"Few know me, so I am honored\"*—\nThis echoes the earlier meaning: *\"The unsmiled-upon is the *Dao*.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s *Dao* suffices within yet does not manifest externally—\nLike wearing coarse cloth while cherishing jade,\nSo none can see it.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is superior,\nTo not know the known is sickness.\nOnly by treating sickness as sickness\nDoes one not fall ill.\n\nThe Sage does not fall ill\nBecause they treat knowing as sickness—\nThus, they do not fall ill.\n\nAt the peak of knowledge, yet appearing ignorant—\nThis is the *Dao*’s summit.\n\nIn the unknowable, yet assuming knowledge—\nThis is the sickness of learning the *Dao*.\n\nIf one treats their knowing as sickness,\nThis sickness will vanish.\n\nThe Sage’s immunity to sickness lies in\nRecognizing knowing as sickness and treating it as such.\n\n*[Note: Some manuscripts incorrectly add \"矣\" to the first sentence—an error.]*\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Fear Not Authority**\nWhen the people fear not authority, *great authority* has arrived.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nDo not exhaust their sustenance.\n\nOnly by not exhausting does one not exhaust.\nThus, the Sage knows themselves yet does not reveal themselves,\nLoves themselves yet does not exalt themselves—\nHence, they discard the former to embrace this.\n\n*\"Those who do not fear punishment always meet it\"*—\nThe opening words are metaphor.\n\n*Jū* 居 means \"broad dwelling.\"\n*Shēng* 生 refers to the principle of longevity and vitality.\nAll narrow their dwellings, exhaust their sustenance—\nUnsettled in retreat yet obsessed with advancement,\nUnaware of emptiness yet bewildered by possession—\nThis is self-narrowing, self-exhausting.\n\n*\"Without\"* is a cautionary admonition: *\"Only this is possible.\"*\nOnly those who do not exhaust endure—\nHence, *\"Thus, only by not exhausting does one not exhaust\"*—\nA deduction from the following sentence.\n\nThough the Sage knows the *Dao*, they do not reveal it,\nYet they can obscure it.\nThough they love themselves, they do not exalt themselves,\nYet they can be humble and lowly.\n\nTo \"discard\" is to abandon the commoners’ narrow, exhausting hearts,\nTo \"take\" is to suffice in this *Dao*—\nHence, *\"take this.\"*\n\n**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**\nBoldness in daring leads to killing,\nBoldness in *not* daring leads to life.\nThese two differ—one beneficial, one harmful.\nWhat Heaven abhors, who knows its reason?\n\nThus, the Sage finds this difficult.\n\n**The Way of Heaven**\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs,\nDoes not speak yet responds with grace,\nDoes not summon yet comes of its own accord,\nOpen and simple yet masterfully plans.\n\nThe Heavenly Net is vast and wide,\nThough sparse, it loses nothing.\n\nThe bold in daring will surely harm themselves.\nTo face matters with fear is to be bold in *not* daring.\nLife is preserved by self-preservation.\n\nThe harm of daring, the benefit of restraint—\nThese two are clearly distinct.\n\nHeaven abhors excess and favors humility,\nThus, the bold in daring are not only despised by men,\nBut also by Heaven.\n\nYet the world’s people do not know this—\nHence, *\"Who knows its reason?\"*\nA deception of those who do not know.\n\nThe Sage finds this difficult,\nFor even the Sage regards this Way as rare and arduous.\n\nHeaven, by not contending, lets nothing escape its reach;\nHeaven, by not speaking, yet holds the principle of response.\nThe interplay of yin and yang comes without being summoned.\n\n*\"Open\"* means simplicity.\nThe *Qian* (Heaven) is known by its ease,\nThe *Kun* (Earth) by its capacity—\nThis is the meaning of *\"open and masterfully plans.\"*\n\nThe Way of Heaven is vast, like a net,\nThough wide and sparse, it misses nothing—\nSpeaking of good and evil, fortune and misfortune,\nNo thread escapes its decree.\n\nThough the Sage acts without contention,\nYet right and wrong, good and bad—\nNot a hair’s breadth may be disordered.\n\nThese lines again liken Heaven to the Way.\n\n---\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you frighten them with fear?\n\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely—\nI seize them and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\nThere are always those entrusted with killing who kill.\nTo take the place of those entrusted with killing is like\nA substitute carpenter taking the chisel.\n\nA substitute carpenter rarely avoids injury to his hands.\n\nThis chapter speaks of distinguishing good and evil.\nSelf-made preferences, carried to extremes,\nAre not the Way of knowing—\nHence, it uses those who wield punishment as an analogy.\n\nThose who govern rely only on death to frighten the people,\nYet the people do not truly fear death.\nIf the people truly feared death,\nThen those who act strangely—\nI seize and punish them—\nThen none would dare.\n\nYet those who act strangely are still killed,\nAnd the people who transgress multiply—\nThus, the people do not truly fear death.\n\nThose entrusted with killing are the Creators.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, those who do good or evil,\nThere are always Creators who hold sway over life and death.\nThose who should be killed are killed by the Creators themselves—\nHence, *\"There are always those entrusted with killing who kill.\"*\n\nFor a state to be overly concerned with punishment\nIs to take the place of the Creators in killing.\nWith my clumsy hands replacing the Master Carpenter,\nFew escape uninjured—\nThis is a metaphor within a metaphor.\n\nThis chapter also arises from the times’ fondness for killing,\nYet its intent is not to abolish punishment entirely.\n\nHeaven punishes the guilty—\nOnly when there is no room for mercy.\n\n---\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\n\nThe people’s hunger stems from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThe people’s difficulty in governing stems from their rulers’ excessive actions.\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—\nThus, those who do not make life their concern\nAre wiser than those who prize life.\n\n*\"Too much in taxes\"* means taking excessively from the people.\n*\"Their rulers’ excessive actions\"* means those who govern overuse clever schemes.\nWhen rulers value profit, the people grow hungrier;\nWhen rulers favor cleverness, the people grow harder to govern—\nThese two lines are also metaphors.\n\nGenerally, when people overindulge in self-preservation,\nThey risk losing their lives.\nExcessive eating and drinking can bring illness—\nThis is one example.\n\nOverindulging in self-care to secure life—\nHence, *\"excessive pursuit of life.\"*\nTo recklessly risk one’s life to gain it—\nHence, *\"disregard for death.\"*\n\nTo forget the self is to preserve the self—\nHence, *\"those who do not make life their concern\nAre wiser than those who prize life.\"*\n\n*\"Prize life\"* is like the previous chapter’s *\"increase life\"*—\nThose who excessively pursue life.\n*\"Wiser\"* means *\"superior.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 76: The Nature of Life**\n\nWhen people are born, they are soft and weak;\nWhen they die, they become stiff and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nWhen born, are soft and brittle;\nWhen dead, wither and decay.\n\nThus, the stiff and strong belong to death,\nThe soft and weak belong to life.\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong trees are felled.\n\nThe strong are low, the weak are high.\n*\"Soft and weak,\" \"stiff and strong\"*—\nBoth are metaphors.\n\nLaozi’s teachings emphasize valuing the soft,\nThus, he uses the birth and death of people and plants as analogies.\n\n*\"Belong to\"* means *\"of the same kind.\"*\nFrom *\"Hence\"* onward, he again uses armies and trees as metaphors.\n\nArmies that rely on strength will not conquer;\nYoung trees are soft, but over time they grow stiff—\nBy the time they reach the thickness of a man’s arms,\nThey are near decay.\n\nThus, those who know the Way prize the soft and weak,\nAnd regard the stiff and strong as inferior.\n\n*\"Felled\"* refers to the felled tree’s curve.\n\n---\n**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**\n\nIs not the Way of Heaven like drawing a bow?\n\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Way diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nBut the Way of man is otherwise—\nThey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nWho can serve the world with what is excessive?\nOnly those who follow the Way—\nHence, the Sage acts without claiming,\nCompletes without dwelling,\nAnd does not desire to be seen as virtuous.\n\nHeaven’s Way abhors excess and favors humility,\nLike a drawn bow—\nIf held too long, it must slacken.\n\nThe high must inevitably humble themselves,\nThe excessive must inevitably diminish,\nThe low must inevitably rise,\nThe bent must inevitably straighten,\nThe diminished must inevitably be replenished—\nThus, Heaven treats all things in this manner.\n\n「而人之为道，何为而不然，乃欲损人而益己；\nYet in the Way of man, why must it be otherwise?—\nThey seek to diminish others to enrich themselves.\n\n不足，而为一己之有余；\nThe deficient, they make into their own excess.\n\n唯有道之人，乃能损我之有余以奉天下；\nOnly those who follow the Dao can diminish my own excess\nTo serve the world.\n\n故曰孰能有余以奉天下，惟有道者。」\nHence it is said: Who can have excess to serve the world?\nOnly those who follow the Dao.\n\n《易》言损益，亦是此意，此亦借以喻道也。\nThe *I Ching* speaks of diminishing and supplementing—\nThis too is the same meaning, a metaphor borrowed to illustrate the Dao.\n\n圣人所以虽有为於天下，而不以自恃，\nThe Sage acts in the world yet does not rely on himself—\n虽功成而不居其功，\nThough his deeds are accomplished, he does not dwell on them,\n虽有至贤之行，而不欲以此自见。\nThough he possesses the most virtuous conduct,\nHe does not wish to be seen as virtuous.\n\n此为道日损，必至於损之而又损也。\nThis is the Dao of daily diminishing—\nIt must reach the point of diminishing even the diminished.\n\n---\n\n**天下柔弱章第七十八**\n**Chapter 78: The World’s Gentleness and Weakness**\n\n天下柔弱莫过於水，\nIn the world, nothing is as gentle and weak as water—\n而攻坚强者莫之能胜，\nYet in overcoming the hard and strong,\nNone can surpass it—\n其无以易之。\nIts power cannot be replaced.\n\n弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，\nThe weak overcome the strong,\nThe gentle overcome the rigid—\n天下莫不知，\nAll under Heaven know this—\n莫能行。\nYet none can practice it.\n\n故圣人云：\nThus the Sage says:\n受国之垢，是谓社稷主；\n*\"Bear the world’s filth, and you may be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"*\n受国之不祥，是谓天下王。\n*\"Bear the world’s misfortunes, and you may be called the King of the World.\"*\n\n正言若反。\nThis is inverted speech.\n\n水为至弱，而能攻坚强，\nWater is the most weak,\nYet it can overcome the hard and strong—\n世未有能胜之者。\nNo one in the world can surpass it.\n\n千金之堤，败於蚁穴之漏，\nA thousand-gold dam is ruined by a leak at the ant’s hole—\n是弱之胜强者。\nThis is the weak overcoming the strong.\n\n无以易於水也，\nNone can replace water—\n故曰其无以易之。\nHence it is said: Its power cannot be replaced.\n\n弱能胜强，柔能胜刚，\nThe weak can overcome the strong,\nThe gentle can overcome the rigid—\n如水之易见，\nAs clear as water—\n人莫不知之。\nYet none know how to do it.\n\n而至道在於能柔能弱者，\nThe ultimate Dao lies in those who can be gentle and weak—\n莫之能行也，\nYet none can practice it—\n故古之圣人常有言曰：\nThus the ancient Sages often say:\n能受一国之垢者，方可为社稷主，\n*\"Only those who can bear a nation’s filth\nMay become its Lord of Soil and Grain.\"*\n能受一国之不祥者，方可为天下王。\n*\"Only those who can bear a nation’s misfortunes\nMay become the King of the World.\"*\n\n此即知其荣，守其辱之意。\nThis is the meaning of *\"knowing its glory yet holding to its shame.\"*\n\n不祥者，不美之名也。\n*\"Misfortune\"* is the name for what is not beautiful.\n\n盖位至高者，不可与天下求胜，\nFor those in the highest position,\nThey cannot vie with the world for victory—\n须能忍辱，则可以居人之上。\nThey must endure shame,\nThen they may stand above others.\n\n垢与不祥，不可受之受也，\nTo bear filth and misfortune\nIs not the kind of bearing others speak of—\n似反一世之常言，\nIt seems contrary to the common speech of the age—\n其实正论，\nYet it is true doctrine—\n故曰正言若反。\nHence it is said: This is inverted speech.\n\n圣人云三字自佳，\nThe Sage’s three words are excellent—\n一本以云为言误也。\nBut the original text mistakenly used *\"cloud\"* instead of *\"say.\"*\n\n---\n\n**和大怨章第七十九**\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\n\n和大怨，必有余怨，\nTo reconcile great grievances\nMust inevitably leave lingering grievances—\n安可以为善？\nHow can this be called good?\n\n是以圣人执左契，\nThus the Sage holds onto the left contract—\n而不责於人。\nYet does not demand it of others.\n\n有德司契，无德司彻。\nThe virtuous govern the contract,\nThe lacking govern the clarity.\n\n天道无亲，常与善人。\nHeaven’s Way has no favorites—\nIt always aids the virtuous.\n\n恩怨两忘，方知至道。\nOnly when one forgets both kindness and grievances\nDoes one truly know the ultimate Dao.\n\n人有大怨於我，\nWhen others hold great grievances against me—\n而必欲与之和，\nYet I must desire to reconcile with them—\n虽无执怨之心，\nThough I have no lingering resentment—\n犹知怨之为怨，\nI still recognize grievance as grievance—\n则此心亦未化矣。\nThen this heart has not yet been transformed.\n\n虽曰能与之和，\nThough I say I can reconcile with them—\n此心未化，\nThis heart has not yet been transformed—\n则余怨尚在，\nSo lingering grievances still remain—\n安得谓之善道，\nHow can this be called the Good Way?\n此诚至理之言，亦借喻也。\nThis is indeed a profound truth, a metaphor as well.\n\n左契者，\nThe left contract—\n如今人合同文字也，\nLike today’s written agreements—\n一人得左，一人得右，\nOne party keeps the left half, the other the right—\n故曰左契。\nHence it is called the left contract.\n\n此契在我，\nIf this contract is with me—\n则其物必可索，\nThen I can demand its fulfillment—\n圣人虽执此契，\nYet the Sage, though holding this contract—\n而不以索於人，\nDoes not demand it of others—\n忘而化也，\nForgetting and transforming it—\n此亦借喻之语。\nThis too is metaphorical speech.\n\n有德者则司主此契而无求索之心，\nThe virtuous govern the contract\nYet have no desire to demand its fulfillment—\n无德者则以明白为主。\nThe lacking use clarity as their guide.\n\n彻，明也，\n*\"Clarity\"* means clarity—\n犹今人言必与之讨分晓也。\nLike how people today say they must demand an explanation.\n\n有德司契者，善人也。\nThose who govern the contract with virtue are good people.\n\n天虽无私亲，而此等有德之人，\nThough Heaven has no partial favorites,\nYet these virtuous people—\n天必佑之，\nHeaven will surely protect them—\n故曰常与善人。\nHence it is said: Heaven always aids the virtuous.\n\n---\n\n**小国寡民章第八十**\n**Chapter 80: Small States and Few People**\n\n小国寡民，\nSmall states, few people—\n使有什伯人之器而不用，\nLet them possess the tools of a hundred men yet not use them—\n使民重死而不远徙。\nLet them value death over distant migration.\n\n虽有舟舆，无所乘之；\nThough they have boats and carriages,\nThey do not ride them—\n虽有甲兵，无所陈之；\nThough they have armor and weapons,\nThey do not display them—\n使民复结绳而用之。\nLet them return to using knotted cords.\n\n甘其食，美其服，\nLet them find their food sweet,\nTheir clothing beautiful—\n安其居，乐其俗。\nTheir dwellings secure,\nTheir customs delightful.\n\n邻国相望，鸡狗之声相闻，\nNeighboring states are visible,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\n民至老死不相往来。\nYet the people do not visit one another\nEven until old age and death.\n\n小国寡民，\nSmall states, few people—\n犹孟子言得百里之地，皆可以朝诸侯，\nLike Mencius saying: *\"With a hundred-li territory,\nOne can attend the feudal lords\"*—\n一天下之意。\nOr rule the world.\n\n老子盖曰，\nLaozi says:\n有道之人若得至小之国，\nIf a Daoist person gains a very small state—\n不多之民井而居之，\nAnd few people as their well—\n使有什伯，\nLet them possess the tools of a hundred men—\n如今人之保伍也，\nLike how people today keep their reserves—\n人人皆有可用之器，\nEach person has tools that can be used—\n而不求自用。\nYet they do not seek to use them themselves.\n\n是人皆有士君子之行，\nThese are people who all possess the conduct of a scholar-gentleman—\n而安於自退也。\nYet they are content with self-withdrawal.\n\n重死而不远徙，\nThey value death over distant migration—\n小人皆畏罪不为恶，\nThe petty fear punishment and do not commit evil—\n而各安其居也。\nYet each remains secure in their own home.\n\n虽有舟舆，无所乘之，\nThough they have boats and carriages,\nThey do not ride them—\n不致远以求利也。\nNot traveling far to seek profit.\n\n虽有甲兵而不陈列，\nThough they have armor and weapons,\nThey do not display them—\n不恃力以求胜也。\nNot relying on strength to seek victory.\n\n合书契而用结绳，\nUsing written contracts yet returning to knotted cords—\n复於素朴也。\nReturning to simplicity and purity.\n\n甘食美衣，安居而乐俗，\nSweet food, beautiful clothing,\nSecure homes and delight in customs—\n邻国虽近，\nNeighboring states, though close—\n鸡狗之声虽相闻，\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs, though heard—\n而老死不相往来，\nYet the people do not visit one another\nEven until old age and death—\n各自足而不相求也。\nEach is self-sufficient and does not seek from others.\n\n此老子因战国纷争，\nThis is what Laozi reflects upon,\nAmidst the chaos of the Warring States—\n而思上古淳朴之俗，\nAnd ponders the simple and pure customs of antiquity—\n欲复见之也。\nDesiring to see them restored.\n\n观其所言，亦有自用之意。\nLooking at his words,\nThere is also the meaning of self-sufficiency.\n\n---\n\n**信言不美章第八十一**\n**Chapter 81: True Words Are Not Ornate**\n\n信言不美，\nTrue words are not ornate—\n美言不信。\nOrnate words are not true.\n\n善者不辩，\nThe good do not argue—\n辩者不善。\nThose who argue are not good.\n\n知者不博，\nThe wise are not learned in many things—\n博者不知。\nThose learned in many things are not wise.\n\n圣人不积，\nThe Sage does not hoard—\n既以为人己愈有，\nThe more he gives to others,\nThe more he possesses—\n既以与人己愈多。\nThe more he gives to others,\nThe more he has.\n\n天之道，利而不害；\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits yet does not harm—\n圣人之道，为而不争。\nThe Dao of the Sage acts yet does not contend.\n\nThis very meaning is expressed.\n\n**善 (shàn)**, pure—\nThe person of pure virtue has no need for words,\nSo why argue?\nTo love argument is to lack pure virtue.\n\nThe knowing of the wise is not measured by their breadth of knowledge,\nNor do they boast in their knowledge—\nThis is not the way of the wise.\n\nThe Dao of the Sage is simply emptiness and unity—\nWhat need for hoarding?\nHe never fails to act for others,\nYet what he retains grows ever more abundant.\nHe never fails to give to others,\nYet what he possesses grows ever more plentiful.\n\nIt is like the Dao of Heaven—\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nActing yet ever producing more.\n\nTo act for others, to give to others—\nThese are words that transform through the Dao.\n\nThough Heaven’s Dao has beauty and benefit,\nIt does not speak of what it benefits,\nSo only benefit is seen and no harm.\nOnce the name of \"benefiting\" is given,\nThen harm also becomes apparent.\n\nThe Dao of the Sage does nothing yet does all things,\nYet never relies on what it possesses,\nSo it does not contend with things,\nAnd thus the world cannot contend with it.\n\nThe essence of this text is fundamentally about *not contending*,\nSo it concludes with these words.\n\n---\n\n**Annotations (as requested, omitted from translation):**\n#1 *\"夫\"* (originally *\"大\"*) – Corrected from *\"Da\"* (great) to *\"Fu\"*

      "translated_text": "**The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing**\n\n**Title:** *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing*\n**Author:** Lin Xiyi of the Song Dynasty (宋林希逸注)\n**Volume:** Four scrolls\n**Source Edition:** *Zhengtong Daozang* (正统道藏), *Dongshen* (洞神) Section, *Yujue* (玉诀) Category\n**Collated Editions:**\n1. *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed Song Edition (hereafter, *Shadow Song Edition*)\n2. *Wuqiu Bei Zhai* Shadow-Printed Japanese Kan'ei 4th Year Edition (hereafter, *Shadow Japanese Edition*)\n\n---\n\n**The Opening Explanation of the Dao De Jing**\n\nThe Master Laozi bore the surname Li (李氏), given name Er (耳), and courtesy name Boyang (伯阳). Because his ears were large and unrefined (漫无轮), he was thus nicknamed Dan (聃). He was a native of Ku County (苦县) in Chu (楚国).\n\nHe served the Zhou dynasty as the Keeper of the Archives (藏室史). During the reign of King Jing of Zhou (周景王), when Confucius was thirty years old, he once inquired about rites from Laozi when he was visiting. Their exchanges are frequently recorded in *The Book of Rites* (礼记). Confucius was of an earlier generation, and it is said: *\"He merely transmits but does not create—he compares himself to me, to Laozi and Pengzu.\"* The Grand Historian Sima Qian also noted that Confucius revered Laozi, and this was not an exaggeration.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-nine years after Confucius’ passing, there was a Zhou court historian named Xian (檐), who once appeared before Duke Xian of Qin (秦献公) and spoke of the cycles of separation and union. Some claim that this Xian was Laozi, but this is incorrect. Xian (檐) and Laozi (老子) share the same pronunciation, and the error arose from transmission.\n\nWhen the Zhou dynasty declined, Laozi traveled westward. As he approached the Sanmen Pass (散关), the Pass Warden, Yin Xi (尹喜), recognizing him as an extraordinary figure, insisted that he record his teachings. Laozi then composed the *Dao De Jing* in two sections, totaling over five thousand words, before departing.\n\nThough these two sections contain chapters, they resemble the *Xici* (系辞) in structure—upper and lower parts. However, the Master of the Yellow River (河上公) divided it into eighty-one chapters, stating that the upper section follows Heaven (法天), whose number is odd, containing thirty-seven chapters; the lower section follows Earth (法地), whose number is even, containing forty-four chapters. Yan Zhen (严遵) further divided it into seventy-two, stating that eight chapters belong to the Yin (阴) Dao and nine to the Yang (阳) Dao, multiplying eight by nine to yield seventy-two. The upper section thus contains forty chapters, and the lower thirty-two. These divisions were not the original intent, nor were the chapter titles that followed.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, Emperor Xuanzong (元宗) revised the chapter divisions, assigning the upper section to the Dao (言道) and the lower to virtue (言德), which was also incorrect.\n\nThe transmitted editions vary greatly, and sometimes a single differing character alters the entire meaning of a chapter. Discerning the true intent becomes even more difficult.\n\nIn general, Laozi’s teachings use material things to elucidate the Dao, often adapting to the customs and inclinations of his time. Yet readers fail to grasp his intent, leading Master Hui (晦翁) to criticize Laozi as overly verbose, while Master Xi Shan (西山) accused him of harboring hidden agendas. Since this text is revered by Daoists, their excessive veneration leads to extravagant interpretations, failing to clarify its true meaning. Meanwhile, Confucian scholars dismiss it as heterodox, seizing upon flaws to condemn it without deeper examination. Though many commentaries exist, they all suffer from these shortcomings.\n\nOnly Master Yingbin (颖滨) has illuminated its meaning, coming close to the truth, yet his explanations of phrasing and textual flow remain incomplete, and many passages still pose difficulties. Moreover, he claims that Laozi’s work aligns with Buddhist scriptures, which is incorrect. Though Zhuangzi followed Laozi’s teachings, his words differ fundamentally from Laozi’s own. Zhuangzi’s *Autobiography* centers on life and death, as seen in *The Book of the World* (天下篇), which is why his ideas often converge with Buddhist thought. However, Laozi’s principles—such as *\"acting without doing, thus transforming\"* and *\"not contending, yet achieving victory\"*—do not contradict our own texts. Their differences stem only from his rhetorical exaggerations to correct societal excesses, occasionally going too far.\n\nMaster Yichuan (伊川) said: *\"The chapter ‘Guishing’ (谷神) is Laozi’s finest.\"* Thus, Master Wending (文定) remarked: *\"Laozi’s five thousand words are like his discussions on ‘I have no affairs,’ ‘I love tranquility,’ and ‘I possess the Three Treasures’—these are his most profound teachings.\"* Zhu Wen Gong (朱文公) also stated: *\"Emperor Wen of Han and Cao Can only grasped the superficial aspects of Laozi’s teachings; Wang Dao and Xie An never reached their essence.\"* He further said: *\"Bo Yi somewhat resembles Laozi.\"* And again: *\"The people of Jin and Song often discuss Zhuangzi and Laozi, yet they fail to grasp their true depths.\"*\n\nThus, even the earlier scholars did not entirely reject Laozi, but because his teachings often used metaphorical language interpreted as literal truth, they were sometimes criticized. This has long been an unresolved debate. If one were to investigate and uncover his original intent, one would truly understand Laozi’s meaning—encountering it as if it were revealed in the morning and evening.\n\nPrefaced by Lin Xiyi of Yongzhai (庸斋林希逸).\n\n---\n**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***",

      "translated_text": "**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***\n**Chapter One: \"The Dao That Can Be Spoken\"**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal Name.\n\nNameless, it marks the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of all things.\n\nEver without, to glimpse its subtlety;\nEver with, to perceive its manifestations.\n\nThese two—though issuing from the same source and bearing different names—are called the Mysterious.\nThe Mysterious beyond the Mysterious: the gateway through which all wonders emerge.\n\nThis chapter stands at the book’s beginning, its essence contained here.\nIts meaning holds that the Dao cannot truly be spoken—any utterance becomes a secondary expression.\n\"Ever\" signifies unchanging, immutable.\n\nWhat can be spoken and named is subject to change;\nWhat cannot be spoken or named is beyond change.\n\nWith names like *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual), and *zhi* (wisdom), the benevolent cannot be righteous, the ritual cannot be wise.\nWith names like spring, summer, autumn, and winter, spring cannot be summer, autumn cannot be winter.\nThus, it is the *eternal Dao*, the *eternal Name*.\n\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth is the time before the *Taiji* (Supreme Polarity) divided;\nIn the human heart, it is the stillness, unmoving foundation.\nBefore the *Taiji* divided, how could there be names for spring, summer, autumn, and winter?\nIn stillness, unmoving, how could there be names for the seven virtues—*ren, yi, li, zhi*?\nThus, it is said: *Nameless, the origin of Heaven and Earth*.\n\nWhen speaking of Heaven and Earth, it is not merely Heaven and Earth—\nit is an analogy for the mind’s true nature.\nOnce names like *yin* and *yang* exist, all transformations arise from them;\nOnce names like *ren* and *yi* exist, all myriad paths begin here.\nThus, it is said: *Named, the mother of all things*.\n\"Mother\" signifies the source from which all things arise.\n\nThe two lines—*Ever without* and *Ever with*—are Laozi’s teaching on ultimate understanding.\nIn the world, all things are *with*, yet who knows this *with* originates from *without*?\nIf one insists on *without*, one risks the reckless void, inviting calamity.\nThus, those who study the Dao must, in moments of *without*, seek its ultimate truth—\nthen perceive the wonder of how *with* arises.\nAnd in moments of *with*, they must seek its ultimate truth—\nthen perceive its origin from *without*.\n\"Manifestations\" (*jiao*)—as in the *Rites of Zhou*—refers to the source from which all things emerge.\nThe two \"desire\" (*yu*) words hold deep meaning: *desire* here means *seek* to attain this ultimate understanding.\n\nThough *with* and *without* are two, though they bear different names, they share the same source.\nIf one constantly observes *without* and *with*, both are called the Mysterious—\nthe Mysterious being the marvel of transformation.\nThus viewed, Laozi’s teaching is not merely about empty nothingness.\nIf one were to insist solely on *without*, it would not say, *\"These two issue from the same source,\"*\nnor *\"Both are called the Mysterious.\"*\n*The Mysterious beyond the Mysterious, the gateway of all wonders*—\nthis is the *Zhuangzi*’s *\"There is a beginning, there is a non-beginning of beginning,\nthere is a non-beginning of the non-beginning of beginning.\"*\nYet it only praises its wonder—no other meaning exists.\nTo say one layer follows another is not its intent.\n*All wonders*—as in the *Yijing*: *\"The wondrous in all things.\"*\n*Gateway*—speaking of their origin.\nMany read this chapter only in terms of Heaven and Earth,\nyet Laozi’s intent is to grasp it in the mind.\nOnly by viewing both together can one fully comprehend this book.\n\n**Chapter Two: \"Under Heaven All Know\"**\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty,\nthen ugliness already exists.\nWhen all know goodness as goodness,\nthen evil already exists.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\ndifficulty and ease complete each other,\nlong and short define each other,\nhigh and low depend on each other,\nsound and voice harmonize,\nbefore and after follow in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nteaches without speech.\nAll things arise, yet he does not claim them;\nHe nurtures, yet does not possess;\nHe acts, yet does not rely on it;\nWhen his work is done, he does not dwell upon it.\nOnly because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him.\n\nThis chapter expounds the meaning of *having yet not dwelling*.\nThere is beauty, there is ugliness;\nThere is goodness, there is evil.\nIf one does not know beauty as beauty,\ndoes not know goodness as goodness,\nthen there is no ugliness, no evil.\n\nFor all things under Heaven,\nwhere there is *being*, there is *non-being*;\nwhere there is *difficulty*, there is *ease*;\nwhere there is *long*, there is *short*;\nwhere there is *high*, there is *low*;\nwhere there is *sound*, there is *voice*;\nwhere there is *before*, there is *after*.\nThe six lines below—*give rise to, complete, define, depend, harmonize, follow*—\nall illustrate the earlier meaning of beauty/ugliness and goodness/evil.\n\nThus, the Sage acts through *non-action*, speaks through *non-speech*—\nnot because he fears emptiness or busyness,\nbut because his work is done without dwelling upon it.\nLike Heaven and Earth nurturing all things,\nendlessly transforming without ceasing—\nhow could they claim the labor?\nAll things fill Heaven and Earth,\nyet Heaven and Earth do not claim possession.\nAs for *being spring, being summer, giving life, taking life*—\nhow does transformation rely on these as its power?\nThus, it is said: *Nurtures yet does not possess; acts yet does not rely on it*.\nIts intent lies solely in *when the work is done, not dwelling upon it*—\nhence, *\"All things arise, yet he does not claim them.\"*\nThe three lines elucidate this action,\nas the *Yijing* says: *\"Kun nurtures and completes all things.\"*\nThis is the meaning of Shun and Yu receiving the Mandate yet not claiming it.\nAll ancient Sages were thus—\nhow could Laozi alone be different?\nYet his words are too austere,\nmaking them seem like heterodox teachings.\n\n*\"Only because he does not dwell upon it does it not depart from him\"*—\nthose who possess *having* cannot truly have it,\nwhile those who do not possess *having* can truly possess it.\nThese eight characters are profound.\nThe *Book of Documents* says: *\"Having virtue, they lose their virtue.\"*\nThis is the very meaning.",
      "overlap_context": " even the earlier scholars did not entirely reject Laozi, but because his teachings often used metaphorical language interpreted as literal truth, they were sometimes criticized. This has long been an unresolved debate. If one were to investigate and uncover his original intent, one would truly understand Laozi’s meaning—encountering it as if it were revealed in the morning and evening.\n\nPrefaced by Lin Xiyi of Yongzhai (庸斋林希逸).\n\n---\n**Volume One of *The Oral Interpretation of the Dao De Jing***",

when unused, it ceases—\nThis too carries the intent of *transformation through excess*.\n*Much speech*—\nMeaning repeated speech.\n*Holding fast to the Central Way*—\nSilently closing one’s mouth.\nMeaning:\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth cannot be exhausted by words—\nMuch speech leads to self-exhaustion;\nBetter to remain silent and forget speech.\nThe Master said:\n*I wish to speak not at all—*\n*What can Heaven say?*\nThe four seasons proceed therein,\nAnd myriad things are born therein.\nThis too carries the same meaning.\nBut the Sage’s words are pure and easily understood,\nWhile this text oscillates wildly, making it difficult to grasp.\nSome may take it as a warning against excessive speech,\nyet this contradicts the chapter’s intent.\nIf one sees through this,\nNot only does the beginning and end cohere within a single chapter,\nwith clear meaning,\nBut its language is concise, profound, and anciently elegant—\nHow could this be easily attained?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: The Valley Spirit Does Not Die** (谷神不死)\n\nThe *Valley Spirit* does not die—\nThis is called the *Dark Feminine*.\nThe *Dark Feminine’s Gate*—\nThis is called the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.\nEndless, as if it exists,\nUsed without exhaustion.\nThis chapter describes the practice of cultivation,\nthough Laozi’s original intent was not solely for cultivation.\n*Essence* is solid, *Spirit* is empty.\n*Valley*—emptiness.\n*The Valley Spirit*—the spirit within emptiness.\nSaying that the human spirit arises from emptiness,\nThus it constantly exists and does not die—\nMysterious and boundless.\n*Feminine*—empty yet not solid.\nThese two characters merely describe *emptiness*.\nHeaven and Earth also arise from this,\nHence called *Root*.\n*Endless*—unceasing and unbroken.\n*As if it exists*—\nNeither clearly present nor absent.\nUsed within emptiness, thus not labored yet ever-present—\nThis is the *empty yet unyielding, moving yet ever more abundant*.\nMaster Hui said:\n*The most subtle principle*\nHolds the intent of *generative generation*.\nThis phrase is fine,\nBut its meaning leans toward theories of life-nurturing.\nThough this chapter can be applied to life-nurturing,\nIts original intent was not solely focused on this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: Heaven Long, Earth Durable** (天长地久)\n\nHeaven is long, Earth is durable.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nThey do not will their own generation,\nThus they endure in generation.\nTherefore, the Sage places his body last yet it is first,\nSets it aside yet it is preserved.\nIs this not because he is without selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\nThis chapter uses Heaven and Earth to illustrate the Sage’s lack of intent.\nHeaven and Earth nurture myriad things naturally,\nWithout intent, thus enduring for ten thousand years as if but a day.\nThe Sage’s cultivation of his body\nLacks intent toward precedence or subsequence,\nLacks intent toward interior or exterior,\nThus nothing precedes him yet he constantly exists—\nTherefore, his lack of selfishness fulfills his selfishness.\nThis *selfishness* refers to the body,\nNot the selfishness of public and private.\nIf *selfishness* is taken as public-private selfishness,\nThen it cannot be said he lacks intent.\nThis phrase is also Laozi’s way of enticing people toward goodness,\nAnd the Buddhist later inverted it with phrases like *true emptiness, true existence*.\nThus *true emptiness* is the meaning of *lacking selfishness*,\n*True existence* is the meaning of *fulfilling selfishness*.\nBut when spoken of, it seems yet another layer higher.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight: The Highest Goodness Is Like Water** (上善若水)\n\nThe highest goodness is like water.\nWater benefits myriad things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people dislike—\nThus it approaches the Dao.\nResiding in goodness of place,\nHeart in goodness of depth,\nSpeech in goodness of kindness,\nAffairs in goodness of ability,\nActions in goodness of timing.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it has no blame.\nThis chapter again uses water to illustrate the lack of intent.\n*Highest goodness*—the utmost goodness,\nSaying that the supreme principle of the world aligns with water.\nWater’s goodness—\nIt benefits myriad things,\nYet never considers itself capable.",

burden,\nWithout it, there would be no burden at all.\nYet people mistakenly value it,\nFor they do not know its true nature.\n\nTo know the true worth of the body,\nTo love the body as the world’s

*image of no-image*—\nThis is *Hunhuang*.\n\nApproach it and you see no head,\nFollow it and you see no tail.\nHold fast to the ancient Dao,\nTo govern the present with the eternal.\nTo know the ancient beginning,\nThis is called *Dao Ji*.\n\nThis chapter describes the Dao’s lack of trace.\n*Yi* means *level/even*.\n*Xi* and *Wei* convey the idea of *invisibility*.\nInitially, the three terms are indistinct,\nAll depicting the Dao’s unseen, unheard, ungraspable nature.\n*Bó* means *to hold*.\nThe three—*Xi, Yi, Wei*—\nTheir names cannot be summoned or questioned,\nFor they are beyond distinction.\nThus, they are merged into one,\nFor they are all the Dao.\n\nThese two lines are Laozi’s own explanation of the three above,\nWhere Laozi says *cannot be summoned or questioned*,\nYet the commentator still distinguishes *Xi, Yi, Wei*.\nFollowing his reasoning, though constrained,\nThe flow of his words remains unbroken.\n\n*Not bright* means *not clear*,\n*Not dark* means *not obscure*.\n*Upper* and *lower* refer to *looking up and down*.\nThese two words should not be rigidly confined,\nBut simply convey that this Dao\nIs neither clear nor obscure,\nWhether sought above or below.\n\n*Endless, yet without name*—\nIts conclusion returns to nothingness,\nThus it is the *form of no-form*,\nThe *image of no-image*—\nThis is also *Hunhuang*.\n\nTo approach it and see no head,\nIs to say it has no beginning.\nTo follow it and see no tail,\nIs to say it has no end.\n\n*Hold fast to the ancient Dao*—\nIts origin was void, yet emerged from it.\nBy knowing its initial void,\nOne may govern the present with the eternal,\nAnd thus grasp the ancient Dao’s essence.\n\n*Ji* means *principle/standard*.\n*Dao Ji* is like saying *human principle*\nOr the *standard of the sovereign’s Way*.\nThis chapter portrays the ancient sage’s mastery.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: The Ancient Sage’s Virtue (古之善为士章)**\nThe ancient sage who mastered the Way\nWas subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nToo deep to be known.\n\nSince it cannot be known,\nHe feigned outward forms to describe it:\n*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter,\n*Jū* like one fearing four neighbors,\n*Yǎn* like a guest,\n*Huàn* like ice about to melt,\n*Dūn* like uncarved wood,\n*Kuàng* like an empty valley,\n*Hún* like muddy water.\n\nWho can make muddy water still,\nAnd slowly it becomes clear?\nWho can remain motionless for long,\nAnd slowly life emerges?\n\nHe who preserves this Dao\nDoes not seek fullness.\nBecause he does not seek fullness,\nHe can endure decay without renewal.\n\nThis chapter depicts one attuned to the Dao’s subtlety,\nDeep in its understanding,\nYet without revealing what he knows.\n\nHis outward appearance comes from *wu xin*—\nA void so profound that knowledge cannot grasp it,\nThus his forms seem effortless.\n*Yu* like one crossing a river in winter—\nThe difficulty of traversing.\n*Yu* also means *leisurely*, *hesitant*.\n*Jū* means *hesitant*, *like one fearing four neighbors*,\nWho dares not act freely.\n*Guest* implies *lack of freedom*.\n*Yǎn* means *serene and composed*.\n*Huàn* means *relaxed and dispersing*—\nLike ice on the verge of thawing,\nSeemingly scattered yet still bound.\n\n*Dūn* means *thick/dense*.\n*Uncarved wood* conveys *wholeness*.\n*Kuàng* means *open/expansive*.\n*Valley* means *void*.\n*Muddy water*—\nWhen left undisturbed, it grows clear;\nWhen stirred, it remains muddy.\nWithin the muddy, if held still,\nSlowly it clears itself.\n*Motionless for long*—\nIf left undisturbed, it moves gently,\nThus it *slowly generates*.\n\n*Who can*—\nAsking who can achieve such balance.\n*Slowly*—\nMeans *with ease*, *gradually*.\n\nThese two lines simply mean\nThat clarity and stillness coexist,\nMotion and rest intertwine—\nClear within the muddy, still within the moving.\n\n*Does not seek fullness*—\nThis is *emptiness*.\n*Decay*—\nMeans *old/used*.\nHe who preserves this Dao\nIs always empty within,\nThus he only sees the old,\nNot the new—\nThis is the Way of the first chapter.\n\nTo endure decay without renewal,\nIs to remain unchanged for a thousand years.\n\nOnly then can one achieve true mastery of the Dao.\nThus, *to endure decay without renewal* is one phrase,\n*Mastery* is another.",

      "translated_text": "「The Supreme Dao, the people below merely know of its existence;\nThe next best thing, they cherish and praise it;\nThe next, they fear it;\nThe next, they scorn it;\nThus, trust is insufficient, and there arises distrust.\n*Ah, how they value words!*\n\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nThe common folk all say, *\"This is how things naturally are.\"*\n*The Supreme Dao* refers to the age of antiquity.\n*Below*, it means the realm of all under Heaven.\nIn the ancient times, the people of all under Heaven only knew of the sovereign’s existence,\nYet all forgot themselves within the transformations of the Dao.\n\nLater, the people began to feel affection and praise toward the sovereign.\nAgain later, they began to feel fear and awe.\nAgain later, they began to scorn and mock.\nThis shows that the Way of the world declines ever downward.\nWhen the virtue/power of the Supreme Dao wanes,\nThe principle of sincerity grows insufficient,\nThus the people of all under Heaven begin to harbor distrust.\nThis is the meaning of the *merchants’ oaths* marking the start of rebellion,\nAnd the *gathering of the people* under the Zhou leading to suspicion.\nOnce the people doubt,\nYet those in governance still complacently value words,\nThus there arise proclamations, teachings, and edicts—\nDoes this not further deepen the people’s suspicions?\n*Ah, how they value words!*—\nThis is the meaning of *complacency*.\n\nIn the age of the Supreme Dao,\nDeeds were already accomplished,\nAffairs already fulfilled,\nAnd the people of all under Heaven silently received their blessings,\nYet did not know whence they came,\nAll saying, *\"This is how things naturally are.\"*\nThis is what is meant by: *The imperial virtue/power is upon me—what has it to do with me?*\n\nSince it is said that valuing words is wrong,\nYet this single phrase concludes it,\nThis is a lament for the present while reflecting upon the past.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: The Great Dao Declines**\n\nWhen the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness;\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, there arises great deceit;\nWhen the Six Relationships are discordant, there arise filial piety and kindness;\nWhen the state is in chaos, there arise loyal ministers.\n\nWhen the Great Dao prevails, benevolence and righteousness are inherent within it.\nOnce the names of benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao grows faint.\nThus it is said: *When the Great Dao declines, there arise benevolence and righteousness.*\nAs if the sun of wisdom and cleverness rises,\nAnd then deceit and falsehood flourish throughout the world.\nWhen the Six Relationships are discordant,\nThen the names of filial piety and kindness arise.\nIn times when the state is in chaos,\nThen the names of loyal ministers arise.\nThese three sentences are all parables,\nIllustrating the meaning of the preceding sentence.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: Reject Learning and Worry Ceases**\n\nTo reject learning and abandon wisdom, the people benefit a hundredfold;\nTo reject benevolence and abandon righteousness, the people return to filial piety and kindness;\nTo reject cleverness and abandon profit, thieves and robbers vanish.\nThese three are considered insufficient in terms of culture,\nThus there arise their corresponding institutions.\n*Seeing simplicity and embracing purity,*\n*Few private concerns and little desire.*\n\nOnce the names of learning and wisdom emerge,\nThen the calamities of the world arise—\nBetter to reject and abandon them,\nAnd the people will naturally benefit.\nOnce the names of benevolence and righteousness arise,\nThen distinctions between filial and unfilial,\nKind and unkind, begin to emerge—\nBetter to reject and discard them,\nAnd let the people forget the Dao,\nThen all will return to the midst of filial piety and kindness,\nWithout any need for distinctions.\n\nWhen cleverness and profit are valued,\nThen thieves and robbers will arise—\nBetter to reject and abandon them,\nThis is what is meant by: *Do not esteem difficult-to-obtain goods,*\n*So that the people will not become thieves.*\n\nLearning and wisdom, benevolence and righteousness,\nCleverness and profit—\nThese three are all the Way of the world\nGrowing ever more refined and cultural,\nThus their names arise.\nFrom the perspective of one who knows the Dao,\nThis refinement is not beneficial for governing the world—\nBetter to entrust the people,\nAnd let them see simplicity and embrace purity,\nFew private concerns and little desire,\nThen the world will naturally have no troubles.\n\n*Order* means *to make*;\n*Entrust* is akin to the reading of *属民* in the *Rites of Zhou*.\nThis meaning is to say:\nThe more advanced the cultural governance,\nThe thinner the Way of the world becomes—\nBetter to return to simplicity and purity,\nAs in the age of

person is the material for the good.\n\n资者，言其赖之以自别也。\n*Material*—\nThis means relying on it to distinguish oneself.\n\n此两句又发明上面无弃人无弃物之意。\nThese two lines further elucidate\nThe meaning above of abandoning neither people nor things.\n\n若有弃人弃物之心，\nIf one harbors a heart to abandon people or things—\n则是有师而不知贵，\nThen one has a teacher yet does not honor it,\n有资而不知爱，\nHas material yet does not cherish it—\n虽自以为智，而不知乃迷之大者。\nThough one may deem himself wise,\nHe does not know this is great confusion.\n\n知此道者，可谓要妙之道。\nHe who knows this Dao\nCan be called the *essential subtlety*.\n\n**知其雄章第二十八**\nThe chapter on *knowing the masculine*—\n\n知其雄，\nKnowing the masculine,\n守其雌，\nAnd holding to the feminine—\n为天下溪。\nMakes one the valley of all under Heaven.\n\n为天下溪，常德不离，\nTo be the valley of all under Heaven,\nOne’s constant virtue never departs—\n复归於婴儿。\nReturning again to the state of the infant.\n\n知其白，\nKnowing the white,\n守其黑，\nAnd holding to the black—\n为天下式。\nMakes one the pattern of all under Heaven.\n\n为天下式，常德不忒，\nTo be the pattern of all under Heaven,\nOne’s constant virtue never errs—\n复归於无极。\nReturning again to the boundless.\n\n知其荣，\nKnowing the honor,\n守其辱，\nAnd holding to the humiliation—\n为天下谷。\nMakes one the valley of all under Heaven.\n\n常德乃足，\nOne’s constant virtue is complete—\n复归於朴。\nReturning again to simplicity.\n\n朴散则为器，\nSimplicity disperses and becomes vessels—\n圣人用之则为官长，\nThe sage uses them and becomes the ruler—\n故大制不割。\nThus the great measure is not severed.\n\n知雄守雌，不求胜也。\nKnowing the masculine and holding to the feminine,\nOne does not seek to conquer.\n\n知白守黑，不分别也。\nKnowing the white and holding to the black,\nOne does not distinguish.\n\n知荣守辱，无歆艳也。\nKnowing the honor and holding to the humiliation,\nOne has no fondness for brilliance.\n\n知守有能为而不为之意。\nKnowing and holding implies\nThe power to act yet not acting.\n\n溪谷在下，\nThe valley is low—\n一水所归也，\nWhere waters converge—\n言如此则天下归之。\nSaying this, all under Heaven will follow.\n\n式，天下以为式也。\n*Pattern*—\nThis is what all under Heaven takes as its model.\n\n常德，\nConstant virtue—\n即首章所谓常道也。\nIs the *constant Way* spoken of in the first chapter.\n\n不离，\nNever departing—\n无间断也。\nMeans no interruption.\n\n不忒，\nNever erring—\n无差失也。\nMeans no deviation.\n\n乃足，\nComplete—\n备全之也。\nIs fully sufficient.\n\n婴儿，\nThe infant—\n无知也。\nIs without knowledge.\n\n无极，\nThe boundless—\n无物也。\nIs without things.\n\n朴，\n*Simplicity*—\n太朴也，\nThis is *Great Simplicity*—\n天地之始也。\nThe origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n太朴既散，而后有器，\nGreat Simplicity having dispersed,\nThen vessels come into being—\n即形而上谓之道，形而下谓之器也。\nThis is the Dao of *that which is above form*,\nAnd vessels of *that which is below form*.\n\n圣人以形而上者，用形而下者，\nThe sage uses *that which is above form*\nAnd employs *that which is below form*—\n则天地之间各有其职。\nThus between Heaven and Earth,\nEach has its proper function.\n\n圣人兼三才，\nThe sage encompasses the Three Powers—\n以御万物，\nTo govern all things—\n虽职覆职载亦听命於我，\nThough functions overlap and shift,\nThey all obey his command—\n是为天地之间，官於物者之长也。\nThus he is the ruler of all things\nBetween Heaven and Earth.\n\n庄子曰：官天地。\nZhuangzi says: *He rules Heaven and Earth*.\n天地之职，\nThe functions of Heaven and Earth—\n亦造化之一官守耳。\nAre but one aspect of the natural transformations.\n\n割，\n*Sever*—\n离也。\nIs separation.\n\n以道制物谓之大制，\nTo govern things with the Dao is called *great measure*—\n大制则道器不相离矣。\nGreat measure means the Dao and things do not separate.\n\n此亦无为而为，自然而然之意。\nThis is also the meaning of *non-action yet action*,\nAnd *spontaneity as it is*.\n\n**将欲取天下章第二十九**\nThe chapter on *when one would take all under Heaven*—\n\n将欲取天下而为之者，\nWhen one would take all under Heaven by force—\n吾见其不得已。\nI see it as inevitable failure.\n\n天下神器，\nAll under Heaven is a divine vessel—\n不可为也。\nCannot be forced.\n\n为者败之，\nTo force it is to ruin it,\n执者失之。\nTo grasp it is to lose it.\n\n凡物或行或随，\nAll things either move forward or follow—\n或嘘或吹，\nEither exhale or inhale—\n或强或羸，\nEither are strong or weak—\n或载或隳。\nEither are completed or destroyed.\n\n是以圣人去甚，\nThus the sage avoids excess—\n去奢，\nAvoids extravagance—\n去泰。\nAnd avoids superfluity.\n\n天下神器，\nAll under Heaven is a divine vessel—\n岂人力所可得。\nHow can it be obtained by human strength?\n\n道盛德至，\nWhen the Dao flourishes and virtue reaches its peak—\n天下归之而不得辞，\nAll under Heaven submits to it without refusal—\n而后可以有天下。\nThen one may truly possess all under Heaven.\n\n若萌取天下之心，\nIf one harbors the thought of seizing all under Heaven—\n而强为善，\nAnd forcibly does good—\n以求有得，\nIn order to gain—\n次不可得矣。\nThen one will surely fail.\n\n此三句是譬喻也，\nThese three lines are metaphors—\n其意盖言凡天下之事，\nTheir meaning is: all things under Heaven—\n不可以有心求也。\nCannot be sought with a deliberate heart.\n\n为者则铃败，\nTo force is to ring the bell of ruin,\n执者则必失，\nTo grasp is to surely lose—\n是皆有心之累也。\nThese are both burdens of the deliberate heart.\n\n故有道者之於物，\nThus those who possess the Dao toward things—\n行者听其自行，\nLet those who move forward do so of their own accord,\n随者听其自随，\nLet those who follow do so naturally,\n嘘者听其自嘘，\nLet those who exhale do so spontaneously,\n吹者听其自吹，\nLet those who inhale do so freely,\n强者听其自强，\nLet the strong act as they will,\n羸者听其自羸，\nLet the weak be as they are,\n成者听其自成，\nLet the completed be so,\n隳者听其自隳，\nLet the destroyed be undone—\n是皆自然而然而已。\nAll this is but spontaneity as it is.」",

*Yijing* speaks: *\"Fruitful action nurtures virtue.\"*\n其果者在我，\nIts fruit lies within oneself—\n而不形诸外，\nYet does not manifest outwardly,\n则无矜伐骄强之名。\nThus there is no name of arrogance, boasting,

they were beautiful, one would surely delight in them,\n乐之者是乐杀人也。\nAnd delighting in them is delighting in killing.\n夫乐杀人者，\nNow, those who delight in killing—\n不可得志於天下矣。\nCannot achieve their desires in the world.\n\n故吉事尚左，\nThus auspicious matters are honored on the left,\n凶事尚右。\nAnd inauspicious matters on the right.\n是以偏将军处左，\nHence, the subordinate general is placed on the left—\n上将军处右，\nWhile

warning with these words.\n佳兵，\n*\"Fine art of war\"*—\n喜用兵者也。\nRefers to those who love to use arms.\n以用兵为佳，\nTo consider wielding arms as fine—\n此不祥之人也，\nThis is the mark of an ill-omened

detests,\n故有道者不为之。\nThus those who possess the Dao do not do it.\n\n且君子之居，\nMoreover, in dwelling—\n每以左为贵，\nThe noble always values the left,\n而兵则尚右，\nYet arms are honored on the right,\n便是古人亦以兵为不祥之事。\nThis shows that even the ancients regarded arms as inauspicious matters.\n非君子之所乐用，\nNot something the noble delights in using,\n必不得已而后为之，\nUsed only when there is no alternative,\n不幸而用兵，\nIf misfortune compels the use of arms—\n必以恬淡为尚。\nOne must uphold equanimity.\n\n恬淡，无味也，\n*\"Equanimity\"* (恬淡) is flavorless—\n即是不得已之意也，\nIt is the same as *\"not being able to help it,\"*\n虽胜亦不以为喜。\nEven if victorious, one does not take pleasure in it.\n不美者，\n*\"Not beautiful\"*—\n言用兵不是好事也。\nMeans that wielding arms is not a good thing.\n若以用兵为喜，\nIf one takes pleasure in wielding arms—\n则是以杀人为乐，\nThen it is to delight in killing,\n岂能得志於天下。\nHow could one achieve their desires in the world?\n\n孟子曰：不嗜杀人者能一之。\nMencius said: *\"Those who do not delight in killing can unite the world.\"*\n亦此意也。\nThis is the same meaning.\n\n偏将军之职位本在上将军之下一\nThe subordinate general’s rank is naturally beneath that of the supreme general—\n今上将军居右，\nYet now the supreme general is on the right,\n而偏将军居左，\nAnd the subordinate general is on the left,\n是古人以兵为凶事，\nThis is because the ancients regarded war as an inauspicious matter,\n故以丧礼处之。\nThus they treated it with funeral rites.\n\n左，阳也。\nThe left is *yang*—\n右，阴也。\nThe right is *yin*—\n丧礼则尚阴，\nFuneral rites are associated with *yin*,\n幸而战胜，\nEven if victorious in battle—\n亦当以居丧之礼，\nOne should still observe mourning rites,\n泣死者而悲哀之可也。\nWeeping for the dead and expressing sorrow is proper.\n以势而言，\nIn terms of rank—\n下反居上，\nThe lower is paradoxically placed above,\n故曰言居上势。\nHence it is said: *\"Those in high positions as if in mourning.\"*\n\n此章之意，\nThe meaning of this chapter—\n盖言人之处世，\nIs that in life—\n有心於求胜者，\nThose who harbor thoughts of seeking victory—\n皆为凶而不为吉也。\nAre all inauspicious, not auspicious.\n\n道常无名章第三十二\nChapter Thirty-Two: *\"The Dao Is Ever Nameless\"*—\n道常无名，\nThe Dao is ever nameless,\n朴虽小，\nYet the primal simplicity, though small,\n天下不敢臣。\nThe world does not dare to

it?\n故曰不敢臣。\nHence it is said: *\"The world does not dare to treat it as a subject.\"*\n\n为侯王者若能守此道，\nIf lords and kings can uphold this Dao—\n则万物自宾服之矣。\nThen all things will naturally submit to them.\n\n天至高也，\nHeaven is supremely high—\n下而接乎地，\nYet descends to meet the Earth,\n天气下降，\nHeaven’s *qi* descends,\n地气上腾，\nEarth’s *qi* ascends—\n而后甘露降焉。\nThen sweet dew descends.\n天地和，\nWhen Heaven

things took form did it receive the name \"Dao.\"\n\n制，作也，是朴散而为器也。\n*\"Zhi\"* means to shape—\nThis is when the undifferentiated simplicity (*pu*) disperses to become things.\n\n此名既有，则一生二，二生三，何所穷已。\nOnce named, it gives rise to two from one,\nThree from two—\nWhere does it end?\n\n知道之士，当於此而知止，则不循名而逐末矣。\nThose who understand the Dao must know when to stop here,\nLest they follow names and chase after trivialities.\n\n循名逐末，则危殆之所由生也，知止则不殆矣。\nChasing after names and trifles breeds peril—\nKnowing when to stop brings safety.\n\n川谷之水，铃归之江海而后止；\nThe waters

enlightenment.\n\n胜人者有力，自胜者强。\nTo overcome others requires strength,\nTo overcome oneself is true power.\n\n知足者富，强行者有志。\nContentment brings wealth,\nPersistent action reveals resolve.\n\n不失其所者久，死而不亡者寿。\nWhoever remains in their proper place endures—\nTo die without perishing is true longevity.\n\n智，私智也。\n*\"Wisdom\"* here means discerning others’ hidden

resolve overcomes *qi*, strength is unyielding—\n得其所安则久而不变，\nFinding true rest ensures enduring stability—\n故曰不失其所者久。\nHence it is said: *\"Whoever remains in their proper place endures.\"*\n\n孔子曰：朝闻道，夕死可矣。\nAs Confucius said:\n*\"To hear the Dao in the morning,\nDeath at dusk would be no loss.\"*\n\n死而不亡者寿，\nTo die without perishing is true longevity—\n亦此意也。\nThis carries the same meaning.\n\n此二句非言语所可解，自证自悟可也。\nThese two lines cannot be fully explained in words—\nSelf-verification and awakening suffice.\n\n---\n大道泛兮章第三十四\n**Chapter 34: The Great Dao Flows**\n\n大道泛兮，其可左右。\nThe Great Dao flows unrestrained,\nMoving without favor to left or right.\n\n万物恃之以生而不辞，\nAll things rely on it for life, yet it does not refuse—\n功成不居，\nIt accomplishes without claiming—\n衣被万物而不为主，\nIt clothes all things yet claims no lordship—\n故常无欲，可名於小矣；\nThus it ever desires nothing,\nAnd may be called \"small\"—\n万物归焉而不知主，可名於大矣。\nYet all things return to it, unaware of any master,\nAnd so it may be called \"great.\"\n\n是以圣人能成其大也，\nThus the Sage achieves greatness—\n以其不自大，故能成其大。\nBecause they do not exalt themselves,\nThey alone achieve true greatness.\n\n泛兮其可左右，\nFlowing without constraint,\n无所系着也。\nIt clings to nothing.\n\n物物皆道之所生，\nAll things are born of the Dao—\n何尝辞之。\nHow could it refuse them?\n\n既生矣，何尝居之以为功。\nOnce born, how could it claim them as its own deeds?\n\n衣被，蒙赖也。\n*\"Clothing\"* means covering and nurturing—\n万物皆蒙赖其利，\nAll things benefit from its grace—\n而道何尝有主宰之心，\nYet the Dao harbors no lordly intent—\n湛然而无所欲，\nSerene and desiring nothing—\n可谓之自小矣，\nThus it may be called \"small\"—\n故曰可名於小。\nHence it is named \"small.\"\n\n道虽小，而万物归之以为主，\nThough the Dao is small,\nAll things return to it as their master—\n道亦不自知，\nYet it knows not itself—\n岂不谓之大乎？\nHow then is it not called \"great\"?\n\n惟其能小，所以能大，\nOnly by being small\nCan it achieve greatness—\n圣人之所以不为大者，故能成其大也。\nThe Sage does not claim greatness,\nAnd thus achieves true greatness.\n\n此即守其雌，为天下溪之意。\nThis is the meaning of *\"embracing the feminine\"* and *\"being a valley to the world.\"*\n\n---\n执大象章第三十五\n**Chapter 35: Grasping the Great Image**\n\n执大象，天下往。\nHold fast to the Great Image,\nAnd all under Heaven will follow.\n\n往而不害，安平泰。\nFollowing without obstruction,\nThey find peace, balance, and ease.\n\n乐与饵，过客止。\nOffer music and feasts,\nAnd passing guests will linger.\n\n道之出言，淡乎其无味。\nThe Dao’s words, when spoken,\nAre bland, without relish.\n\n视之不足见，听之不足闻，\nTo look upon it is unsatisfying,\nTo listen is unfulfilling—\n用之不可既。\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\n\n大象者，无象之象也。\nThe \"Great Image\" is the form of the formless—\n天下往者，执道而往行之天下也。\nThose who follow are those who uphold the Dao in their actions.\n\n以道而行，则天下孰得而害之。\nActing in accordance with the Dao,\nWho under Heaven could harm them?\n\n天下无所害，则安矣，平矣，泰矣。\nWithout harm in the world,\nThey are at peace, balanced, and at ease.\n三字亦只一意也。\nThese three words convey a single meaning.\n\n乐，钟鼓之乐也。\n*\"Music\"* refers to ceremonial bells and drums—\n饵，饮食也。\n*\"Feasts\"* means food and drink.\n张乐设馔以待嘉客，\nSetting out music and banquets to welcome honored guests—\n乐终食尽，客过则止矣。\nWhen the music ends and the feast is done,\nGuests depart.\n\n过者，去也，\n*\"Over\"* means to leave—\n是筵席必有散时也。\nBanquets must eventually conclude.\n\n道之可味，虽若甚淡，\nThough the Dao’s flavor seems bland—\n视之虽不可见，\nThough it cannot be seen—\n听之虽不足闻，\nThough it cannot be heard—\n言其不足悦耳目也，\nThis is because it does not please the senses—\n而用之於今古而不尽。\nYet its use spans past and present without end.\n\n此即物有尽而道无穷之意。\nThis conveys the idea that *\"things are finite, but the Dao is boundless.\"*\n\n道之出言，道形於言也，\nThe Dao’s words are its manifestation in speech—\n犹曰道之为言也。\nAs if to say: *\"The Dao’s name.\"*\n\n---\n将欲噏之章第三十六\n**Chapter 36: Before Taking Away**\n\n将欲噏之，必固张之；\nBefore you can gather,\nYou must first stretch it taut—\n将欲弱之，必固强之；\nBefore you can weaken,\nYou must first strengthen—\n将欲废之，必固兴之；\nBefore you can discard,\nYou must first establish—\n将欲夺之，必固与之，\nBefore you can take,\nYou must first give—\n是谓微明。\nThis is called *\"subtle enlightenment.\"*\n\n柔之胜刚，弱之胜强。\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nWeakness overcomes strength.\n\n鱼不可脱於渊，\nFish cannot escape the depths—\n国之利器，不可以示人。\nNor should a nation’s sharpest tools be displayed to all.\n\n此章前八句皆是譬喻，\nThese first eight lines are all metaphors—\n只是得便宜处失便宜之意。\nIllustrating the principle of *\"gaining advantage by first yielding advantage.\"*\n\n噏，敛也，弛也。\n*\"Nyon\"* means to gather or relax—\n张者必弛，\nWhat is stretched must relax—\n强者必弱，\nWhat is strong must weaken—\n兴必有废，\nWhat is established must decay—\n得必有失。\nWhat is gained must be lost.\n\n与，得也。\n*\"Give\"* means to grant—\n夺，失也。\n*\"Take\"* means to deprive.\n\n人#5 惟不知，自以为喜，\n#5 People, in their ignorance, take pleasure—\n而不知此理虽晦而实明，\nYet they fail to see that though this principle seems obscure,\n故曰微明#6。\nIt is truly enlightening.\n\n微，犹晦也，\n*\"Subtle\"* is like *\"obscure\"*—\n言虽微而甚易见也。\nSaying that though subtle, it is easily perceived.\n\n但能柔弱，必可以胜刚强，\nOnly by embracing softness and weakness\n必可以胜刚强，\nCan one overcome hardness and strength—\n此亦守雌守黑之意。\nThis too is the meaning of *\"embracing the feminine and the dark.\"*\n\n渊，喻道也。\n*\"The depths\"* symbolize the Dao—\n鱼，喻人也。\n*\"Fish\"* symbolize people.\n人之不能外於道，犹鱼之不可脱於渊也。\nJust as people cannot exist outside the Dao,\nSo fish cannot escape the depths.\n\n国之利器，若以示人，盗贼之招也。\nA nation’s sharpest tools,\nIf displayed to others, invite thieves.\n\n道之为用在我，\nThe Dao’s power lies within—\n若自眩露而以求胜於物，\nYet if one flaunts it to outdo others—\n亦犹以国之利器而示人也。\nIt is like displaying a nation’s sharpest tools.\n\n此亦前章善者果而已，不可以取强之意。\nThis too echoes the earlier idea:\n*\"The good are content with their harvest—\nThey do not seek to dominate.\"*\n\n---\n道常无为章第三十七\n**Chapter 37: The Dao Ever Does Nothing**\n\n道常无为，而无不为。\nThe Dao ever does nothing,\nYet nothing remains undone.\n\n侯王若能守，万物将自化。\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\n\n化而欲作，吾将镇以无名之朴。\nWhen transformation stirs to action,\nI would restrain it with the nameless simplicity.\n\n无名之朴，亦将不欲，\nThe nameless simplicity would also desire nothing—\n不欲以静，\nDesiring

Non-Ultimate does not cling to virtue/power—\nThus it has virtue/power.\nThe virtue/power of the Lowly does not lose virtue/power—\nThus it lacks virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;\nThe virtue/power of the Lowly acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone;\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete.\nThe Virtue/Power of the Highest Ceremony acts with effort yet none respond—\nThen they roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\n\nThus, one loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power,\nLoses virtue/power and then gains benevolence,\nLoses benevolence and then gains righteousness,\nLoses righteousness and then gains ceremony.\n\nCeremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness,\nAnd the beginning of chaos.\nPreemptive knowledge is the adornment of the Dao/Way,\nAnd the origin of folly.\n\nThus, the true person dwells in substance, not in veneer;\nDwells in reality, not in adornment.\n\nHence, they abandon the latter and take the former.\n\nThe person of the Non-Ultimate’s Virtue/Power possesses virtue/power yet does not know their own transformative power—\nOnly their ability to transform is why they have virtue/power.\nThose who do not lose virtue/power cling to it without transformation—\nClinging without transformation is not yet virtue/power,\nHence it is called lacking virtue/power.\n\nThe Virtue/Power of the Non-Ultimate and the Lowly are merely the continuation of the previous chapter’s discussion on the *Taishang*’s Way.\n\n*\"Acts without effort yet nothing remains undone\"* means *\"acts without effort yet nothing is left undone.\"* (i)\nThe *\"for\"* (以) is the presence of intention.\n*\"Nothing remains undone\"* is acting without intention.\n\nThe Lowly’s *\"something remains incomplete\"* is the result of deliberate action—\nOf form and contrivance.\nHaving spoken of the Non-Ultimate’s and the Lowly’s virtue/power,\nHe then follows with benevolence and righteousness.\n\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Benevolence acts without effort yet nothing remains undone\"*—\nThis is benevolence as the Non-Ultimate’s virtue/power.\n*\"The Virtue/Power of the Highest Righteousness acts with effort yet something remains incomplete\"*—\nThis is righteousness as the Lowly’s virtue/power.\n\nThe Master Laozi’s teachings regard ceremony as a means to strengthen the world,\nFirst using benevolence and righteousness to modulate and balance its application,\nThen proceeding to ceremony—\nThus ceremony is the most inferior of the three.\n\nTo act yet meet no response is to compel the people while they do not follow—\n*Reng* (仍), to draw or pull.\nThe people do not follow, yet they are compelled by force.\n*Reng* is the act of forcibly drawing or pulling.\nThis is merely a vivid description of compelling the people—\nHence it is said: *\"They roll up their sleeves and force it upon them.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way is natural.\nVirtue/Power is what is obtained.\nThe natural transforms, the obtained does not—\nHence it is said: *\"One loses the Dao/Way and then gains virtue/power.\"*\n\nBenevolence has the heart of love and benefit,\nAnd is yet lower than virtue/power.\nRighteousness has the heart of judgment and restraint,\nAnd is yet lower than benevolence.\nCeremony has the intention of compelling the people,\nAnd is yet lower than righteousness.\n\nThe Master Laozi’s terms for *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), and *li* (ceremony)\nDiffer in meaning from those of Confucius and Mencius—\nOne may seek their intent within his text.\nIf one insists on their conventional meanings,\nThen they are all misapplied.\n\nCeremony is the thin veneer of loyalty and trustworthiness—\nIt speaks of outward adornment without inner sincerity.\nIts intent is that ceremony arises from human artifice,\nHence it is called the beginning of chaos.\n\nPreemptive knowledge is the accumulation of past words and deeds.\nTo take this as wisdom is to stray from the true Dao/Way.\n*Hua* (华) is the pursuit of externals.\nIf one takes this as wisdom, it is in fact self-delusion—\nHence it is called the origin of folly.\n\n*\"Substance\"* and *\"reality\"* are merely the intent of pursuing the inner.\n*\"Abandon the latter and take the former\"* means one does not adhere to ceremony but to the Dao/Way.\nThis is the Dao/Way.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: *\"The One of Old\"***\n\nThe One of Old—\nHeaven obtains the One and thus becomes clear,\nEarth obtains the One and thus becomes settled and tranquil,\nThe spirit obtains the One and thus becomes responsive and alive,\nThe grain obtains the One and thus becomes full,\nAll things obtain the One and thus come to life,\nThe lords and kings obtain the One and thus establish their rectitude over the world.\n\nTheir attainment is all through the One—\nHeaven without the One would fear dissolution,\nEarth without the One would fear upheaval,\nThe spirit without the One would fear stagnation,\nThe grain without the One would fear exhaustion,\nAll things without the One would fear annihilation,\nThe lords and kings without the One would fear losing their noble standing.\n\nThus, the noble depends on the humble as its root,\nThe high depends on the low as its foundation.\n\nHence, the lords and kings call themselves *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"few\"* (寡), *\"not abundant\"* (不谷)—\nIs this their dependence on the humble as root?\nOr is it not?\n\nThus, they have many chariots yet no chariots,\nDo not desire to be rounded like jade,\nNor to be polished like stone.\n\nThe One is the Dao/Way.\nHeaven’s clarity and the manifestation of its forms are through this Dao/Way,\nEarth’s tranquility and its capacity to bear all things are through this Dao/Way,\nThe spirit’s responsiveness and vitality are through this Dao/Way,\nThe grain’s fullness and abundance are through this Dao/Way—\nAll are through this Dao/Way.\n\nAll things’ coming to life is also through this Dao/Way,\nThe lords and kings’ rectitude over the myriad lands is also through this Dao/Way.\nTheir attainment is through this Dao/Way—\nThis is why they become clear, tranquil, alive, full, and rectified,\nAll through this Dao/Way.\n\n*Lie* (裂) is akin to *\"breaking\"* in the *Zhouyi* (I Ching) as *\"segmented.\"*\n*Fa* (发) is movement without stability.\n*Xie* (歇) is the fading of responsiveness and vitality.\n*Jie* (竭) is exhaustion.\nThe empty can receive—\nThe unempty is exhausted and thus cannot receive.\n\n*Ju* (蹶) is akin to *\"falling\"* or *\"losing one’s place.\"*\nTo be in a noble and high position yet lack this is to be like the fallen—\nHence it is said: *\"The noble and high would fear losing their standing.\"*\n\nThe humble and the low are as the previous chapter’s *\"few, yet they obtain it\"*—\nAll are empty yet not self-possessed.\n\nThe two sentences on *\"the noble depends on the humble\"* and *\"the high depends on the low\"*\nAre mere metaphors.\nWithout the humble, how can there be the noble?\nWithout the low, how can there be the high?\nThe low and the humble are the fundamental basis of the noble and the high.\n\nThe lords and kings’ self-designation as *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"few\"* (寡人), *\"not abundant\"* (不谷)\nAre all words of self-humility,\nAnd also metaphors for emptiness without self-possession.\n\n*\"Or is it not?\"* (非乎) asks:\nIf I say this, is there not truth in it?\nZhuangzi said: *\"‘Or is it not?’—Yet the historian Zengzi agreed!\"*\nThis is of the same rhetorical style,\nA peculiar turn in the

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Fifty: The Art of Nurturing Life**\n\nThose who excel in nurturing life\nWalk the land without meeting rhinoceros or tiger,\nEnter battle without bearing armor or weapons.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to strike with its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause there is no *sǐdì* within them.\n\n*\"Outborn, inborn\"*—these four characters are the chapter’s guiding thread.\nThere is a subtle mystery in the mechanism of life and death:\nWhen one *outborns*, it is to transcend and depart;\nWhen one *inborns*, it is to be lost in confusion.\nOnly those who follow the Dao can *inborn* and then *outborn*.\n\nHeaven has twelve *shén* (constellations),\nThe year has twelve months,\nThe day has twelve *shí* (hours).\nTwelve is the completeness of beginning and end.\nYet when one adds another number to twelve,\nIt becomes thirteen—a clear return to the *yī* (one),\nNot called *yī* but *shísān*,\nThis is the peculiarity of its phrasing,\nSpeaking of how all human life and death originate from this *yī*.\n\n*Yī* is the *jǐ* (precursor).\nIf one cultivates it in accordance with the Dao,\nThen one may attain longevity and enduring vision.\nIf one cultivates it contrary to the Dao,\nThen one will perish with all things.\n\n*\"Tú\"* refers to their kind.\nThe character *yī* is difficult to speak of,\nYet even naming the beginning of a single thought is not precise—\nOne must recognize it within oneself.\n\n*\"The people’s life\"*—those who live in the world,\nTheir tendency toward *sǐdì* lies in the initial impulse of this single thought.\nOnce that impulse is unstable,\nMovement leads directly to *sǐdì*.\n\n*\"Dòng\"* is not the *dòng* of motion and stillness,\nBut the *dòng* of hasty action.\n*\"Zhī\"* means \"to go.\"\n*\"Sǐdì\"* is the place of death.\n*\"Fúhézé?\"*—a rhetorical question.\n\nThese words are the foundation of all ancient and modern cultivation.\nThus, Laozi speaks of them with great care.\n*\"Shēng\"* is what gives rise to me.\n*\"Shēngshēng\"* is how I nurture my life.\nIf nurturing life becomes excessive,\nThen movement leads directly to *sǐdì*.\n\nThis is the meaning of:\nLightening the body to preserve it,\nHaving nothing to possess all,\nBeing empty to attain fullness,\nDiminishing to increase.\n\nNow returning to *\"Guāiwén\"*—\nI have heard of those ancient masters of nurturing life,\nWho, even walking through deep forests, did not meet rhinoceros or tiger,\nAnd, entering battle, were not harmed by armor or weapons—\nBecause they had no *xin*, things could not harm them.\nThe rhinoceros could not gore,\nThe tiger could not maul,\nWeapons could not wound—\nAll because they had no *xin*.\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Enter water and it does not wet you,\nEnter fire and it does not burn you.\"*\nThis is the same meaning.\n\n*\"Fúhézé?\"*—another question,\nAsking why things could not harm them—\nBecause they could be empty, could diminish, could be without,\nAnd thus had no *sǐdì*.\n\nThis chapter contains two *\"Fúhézé?\"* questions,\nTheir meaning is profound,\nRevealing Laozi’s profound application.\nIn ancient times, there was a temple with a pond before it,\nWhere a vicious water dragon dwelled—\nNo one dared approach.\nA monk arrived from afar, unaware of it,\nAnd, reaching the pond’s edge, stripped and bathed.\nOnlookers warned him:\n*\"This pond holds a vicious dragon—you must not bathe!\"*\nThe monk replied:\n*\"I have no intent to harm things,\nThings have no intent to harm me.\"*\nHe bathed and emerged unscathed.\nLaozi’s words, though seemingly empty,\nAre proven true by this account.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-One: The Dao Gives Birth, Virtue Nourishes**\n\nThe Dao gives birth to it,\nVirtue nurtures it,\nThings shape it,\nCircumstances complete it.\nThus, all things do not fail to honor the Dao and revere virtue.\n\nThe Dao’s eminence,\nVirtue’s nobility—\nNone command them, yet they act naturally.\nThus, the Dao gives birth, nurtures, grows, matures,\nCompletes, ripens, sustains, and shelters.\nGiving birth yet not possessing,\nActing yet not relying,\nGrowing yet not ruling—\nThis is called *Xuándé* (Mysterious Virtue).\n\nThe Dao is *naturally* without,\nAll things arise from non-being,\nThus, *\"The Dao gives birth to it.\"*\nVirtue, however, has its path,\nThus, *\"Virtue nurtures it.\"*\n*Nurturing* means *having*.\nThings have form,\nThus, *\"Things shape it.\"*\nCircumstances have opposition,\nThus, *\"Circumstances complete it.\"*\nThe interplay of yin and yang,\nThe succession of the four seasons—\nThese are all *circumstances*.\n\n*\"Mò zhī mìng\"*—meaning *\"none command it, yet it acts\"*—\nNot by any deliberate force,\nBut by constant naturalness.\n\n*\"Zūn guì\"*—speaking of their transcendence above all things.\n*\"Mìng\"* is not *\"爵\"* (nobility).\n\n*\"Grow, mature, complete, ripen, sustain, shelter\"*—\nAll speak of the process after birth and possession,\nWhere, within heaven and earth,\nLife endlessly generates—\nAll the work of transformation.\nYet the Creator does not possess what it creates,\nDoes not claim credit for its deeds,\nThough it governs, it has no masterful intent—\nThis is the mystery of *Xuándé*.\n*Xuándé* is the very process of transformation.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of losing the Dao and then virtue;\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao giving birth and virtue nurturing,\nHonoring the Dao and valuing virtue—\nThus, the character *dé* here differs from the previous chapter.\nReaders of *Laozi* must not be so rigid in their distinctions.\n\n---\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Origin of the World**\n\nThe world has its origin,\nWhich serves as the world’s mother.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne knows its children;\nHaving known its children,\nOne returns to guard its mother—\nAnd thus, one’s life is never in peril.\n\nClose its openings,\nShut its gates,\nAnd one’s life will never be exhausted.\nOpen its openings,\nAnd one’s affairs will be completed—\nYet one’s life will never be saved.\n\nSeeing what is small is called *míng* (clarity),\nGuarding what is soft is called *qiáng* (strength).\nUsing its light,\nOne returns to its clarity.\nWithout leaving oneself to calamity,\nThis is called *\"clinging

**德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) is firmly established\nAnd **朴** (*pǔ* / *primordial simplicity*) is firmly embraced,\nThen it shall neither uproot nor loosen.\n\nA family with sons and grandsons\nMust

analogies,\nSpeaking of how the **Dao/Way**, though seemingly nonexistent, truly endures.\n\nCultivate it in the body, and it is real without deceit;\nCultivate it in the family, and it accumulates with lasting blessings;\nCultivate it in the village, and it earns the village’s reverence;\nCultivate it in the state, and its influence grows ever greater;\nCultivate it in the world, and its reach extends ever farther.\n\n**長** (*cháng* / *enduring*) means revered,\n**豐** (*fēng* / *flourishing*) means abundant,\n**普** (*pǔ* / *universal*) means far-reaching.\n\nFrom my own body, I can observe others’ bodies,\nFrom my own family, I can observe others’ families,\nFrom my own village, I can observe others’ villages—\nExtending this to states and the world applies equally.\nThis is the **Dao/Way**’s uniform principle.\n\nBy this, the **Dao/Way** is known.\nObserving through the **Dao/Way**,\nThe world has no contrary.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Five: The Profound Embrace of Virtue/Power**\nThe profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)\nIs seen in the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nSnatching birds do not clutch.\n\nThough bones are weak and sinews soft,\nThe grasp is firm.\nThough unaware of male and female union,\nThe **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—\nThis is the peak of **精**

*force*).\n\nWhen things grow robust, they grow old—\nThis is called **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),\nAnd **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*) perishes early.\n\nThe profound embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*)\nIs the concealment and nurturing without display.\n**厚** (*hòu* / *profound*) means **至** (*zhì* / *ultimate*).\n\nWhen the embrace of **德** (*dé* / *virtue/power*) reaches its ultimate,\nIt is like the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*).\n\nPoisonous insects do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not attack,\nSnatching birds do not clutch—\nThis means things cannot harm it,\nJust as entering water does not wet it,\nAnd entering fire does not burn it.\n\nThe **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s bones are most frail,\nIts sinews most tender,\nYet its grip is unyielding.\n\nThough unaware of male and female union,\nIts **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is already formed—\nIts **精** (*jīng* / *essence*) is abundant.\n\n**命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*) is the **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*)’s original **命** (*mìng* / *vital essence*).\n\nThough it cries all day,\nIts throat never grows hoarse—\nIts heart knows no joy nor anger,\nIts **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) is naturally harmonious.\n\nThe throat is the **咽喉** (*yànhóu* / *pharynx/larynx*),\nHoarseness is **氣** (*qì* / *qi*) obstruction.\n\nThe **赤子** (*chìzǐ* / *baby*) is pure, singular, and unyielding,\nThus it can be so.\nThe **有道者** (*yǒudàozhě* / *Daoist*) is the same—\nOnly the heart does not move.\n\n**和** (*hé* / *harmony*) is the preservation of pure **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).\nKnowing this ultimate harmony,\nOne can endure constantly without change.\nKnowing this constant endurance,\nOne can be said to be **明** (*míng* / *clear*) in the **Dao/Way**.\n\nLife cannot be artificially enhanced,\nForcing such enhancement brings misfortune.\n**祥** (*xiáng* / *omen*) is **妖** (*yāo* / *unnatural/portentous*).\nThus, it is said: *Adding to life is an omen.*\n\nThe **心** (*xīn* / *heart*) forces the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*)—\nThis is **志** (*zhì* / *aspiration*) moving the **氣** (*qì* / *qi*).\n**強** (*qiáng* / *force*) means **暴** (*bào* / *brutality*).\nBrutality is **不道** (*bùdào* / *not the Dao/Way*),\nThus, it is said: *Forcing the qi with the heart is force.*\n\nBy this as force,\nNothing remains unbroken—\nLike things growing robust,\nNothing remains unaging.\nThis is not called the **Dao/Way**.\n\n**早已** (*zǎoyǐ* / *early cessation*)—\nStop quickly and do not act.\n**已** (*yǐ* / *cessation*) means **止** (*zhǐ* / *halt*).\nThese three lines have already appeared in **Chapter Thirty**.\n\n**Chapter

      "translated_text": "---\n\n*\"Now, **frugality** (*sè*) is the very reason for **early return** (*zǎo fù*), and **early return** is called **accumulating virtue/power** (*chóng jī dé*). To accumulate virtue/power means nothing cannot be overcome; nothing cannot be overcome means none can fathom its limits, and if none can fathom its limits, one can establish a state. The foundation of establishing a state, one can endure long and prosper. This is called the **Dao/Way of deep-rooted and firmly grounded** (*shēn gēn gù dì*) **enduring life and long vision** (*cháng shēng jiǔ shì*).\n\nThe **frugal** (*sè*) one holds **abundance without exhaustion** (*yǒu yú bù jìn yòng zhī yì*). Thus, they can **possess without holding** (*néng yǒu ér wú*), **be solid yet appear empty** (*néng shí ér xū*), making it fitting that they can **govern people** (*lián rén*) and **serve the Dao/Way** (*shì tiān*). **Early return** (*zǎo fù*) means **reverting to the root** (*guī fù yú gēn*). **Limit** (*jí*) is **early** (*zǎo*), **early** is **not distant** (*bù yuǎn*). **Return** (*fù*) is **reverting to the origin and restoring the fundamental** (*fǎn běn huán yuán*). When virtue/power reaches this stage, it grows ever more abundant and flourishing. **Accumulating** (*chóng*) means **ever-increasing accumulation** (*yù jī zhī yì*). **Overcome** (*kè*) means **capability** (*néng*). The more virtue/power flourishes, the more nothing is impossible in its application. If none can fathom its limits, it means **exhaustless use** (*yòng zhī bù qióng*). Exhaustless use means one can **establish a state** (*wéi guó*) and endure long.\n\n**Foundation** (*mǔ*) means **nurturing** (*yǎng*). To nurture people with goodness is to **rule the world** (*fú tiānxià*). Thus, it is for **governing the state** (*zhì guó*), and likewise for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*). If one can nurture life with **harmony** (*yīn*), then they can **deepen its roots** (*shēn qí gēn*), **ground its foundation** (*gù qí dì*), achieve **enduring life** (*cháng shēng*), and attain **long vision** (*jiǔ shì*). **Roots and foundation** (*gēn dì*) are the **source of primordial qi** (*yuán qì zhī mǔ*). **Long vision** (*jiǔ shì*) means **unfaltering spirit** (*jīngshén quán kě jiǔ shì ér bù shùn*).\n\nNow, those who **cultivate qi** (*fú qì*) may possess such techniques, though not the learning of **Laozi** (*Lǎozi*), yet they can **verify the words of Laozi** (*kě yàn Lǎozi zhī yán*). This chapter uses **governing the state** (*zhì guó*) as an analogy for **nurturing life** (*yǎng shēng*).\n\n---\n*\"The chapter of **governing a great state** (*zhì dà guó*)—the sixtieth:*\n\n**Governing a great state** is like **poaching a small fish** (*rú pēng xiǎo xiān*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), its **spirits** (*guǐ*) are not **divine** (*shén*). Not that its spirits are not divine, but that the divine does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Sage** (*shèngrén*) also does not harm. Both **not harming each other** (*liǎng bù xiāng shāng*), thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*dé jiāo guī fǎn*).\n\nThis chapter first **emphatically states** (*xiān dùn yī jù*) a sentence, to express the meaning of **not disturbing** (*ān jìng bù rǎo*). **Poaching a small fish** means **stirring it breaks** (*jiǎo zhī zé suì*). For **governing the state**, **disturbing it causes chaos** (*rǎo zhī zé luàn*). **Purity, tranquility, and non-action** (*qīngjìng wúwéi, ānjìng bùrǎo*), this is the **Dao/Way of governing the state** (*zhì guó zhī Dào*).\n\nHaving introduced this meaning in the first sentence, the following discusses the **Dao/Way of the Three Talents** (*sān cái zhī Dào*), all of which revolve around **not disturbing** (*bù rǎo*). To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (*yǐ Dào lì tiānxià*), this **world** (*tiānxià*) encompasses the **Three Talents** (*sān cái*). All beneath the **Great Void** (*Tài xū*), governed by the **Dao/Way**, the **Heaven** (*tiān*) fulfills its role of **covering** (*fù*), the **Earth** (*dì*) fulfills its role of **bearing** (*zài*), and the **Sage** fulfills their role of **teaching** (*jiào*). The three each fulfill their duties without encroaching upon one another, thus all attain their **Dao/Way** (*dé qí Dào*).\n\n**Spirits** (*shén*) are **yang** (*yáng*); **ghosts** (*guǐ*) are **yin** (*yīn*). Though it does not say **yin-yang** (*yīn yáng*) but **spirits and ghosts** (*shén guǐ*), this aligns with the **authentic intent of the text’s composition** (*zhèng qí zhuó shū lì zhī yì*), not desiring full revelation. When it says **its ghosts are not divine** (*qí guǐ bù shén*), it means the **Earth** abides by **yin** yet does not interfere with **yang**. Not that its ghosts are not divine, but that the **divine** (*shén*) of the **Heaven** does not harm people. Not that the divine does not harm people, but that the **Earth** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*dì jìn dì zhī Dào*) without interfering with **Heaven**, while **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** (*tiān jìn tiān zhī Dào*) without interfering with people, hence it is said **the divine does not harm people** (*qí shén bù shāng rén*).\n\nNot that the divine does not harm people, but that **Heaven** exhausts its own **Dao/Way** without interfering with people; the **Sage** also exhausts their own **Dao/Way** without interfering with **Heaven and Earth**. The **mysterious** (*yōu*) becomes **yin-yang**, the **manifest** (*míng*) becomes **Sage and governance** (*shèng zhì*). These two do not harm each other, thus their virtue/power **returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*).\n\nIt is said that **Heaven and Earth attain the natural Dao/Way** (*tiān dì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), the **Sage** also attains the natural **Dao/Way** (*shèngrén yì dé zìrán zhī Dào*), each possessing their own virtue/power without encroaching, hence it is said **virtue/power returns and intermingles** (*jiāo guī zhī*). **Not harming each other** (*bù xiāng shāng*) means **not encroaching** (*bù xiāng qīn*), and the **Sage** also does not harm. The following line mistakenly adds an extra **people** (*mín*) character—an error. The **Commentary on the Daoist Classic of Virtue and Dao/Way** (*Dàodé Zhēn Jīng Kǒuyì*) concludes here in the third volume.\n\n---\n*#1: Original reads **\"誉\"** (*yù*), corrected according to the **shadow-printed Song edition** (*yǐng sòng běn*).\n#2: Original reads **\"所地\"** (*suǒ dì*), corrected according to the **shadow-printed Song edition** (*yǐng sòng běn*).*",

to examine.\n*Fu* 复 is *fan* 反—this too is metaphorical speech.\n\nThe Sage acts thus in all things,\nWith a heart that dares not act,\nOnly then can they assist the natural unfolding of all things.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Five: The Ancient Masters of the Dao**\nThe ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,\nBut rather to make them simple.\nThe people are hard to govern because their cleverness is excessive.\nTo govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nTo govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\nKnowing these two principles is the model.\nTo know this model is called *Xuan De* 玄德—\nProfound and distant, contrary to things, yet reaching *Da Shun* 大顺.\n\nKeen intelligence is a burden of the Dao.\nThe Sage’s teaching of others always seeks to dim their brilliance,\nLest they burden themselves—\nThus it is said: *\"Not to enlighten the people, but to make them simple.\"*\n\nThe character *yu* 愚 is ill-placed here—\nQin’s deception of the common folk stems from this error.\nHence, Master Hui’s critique of it as *lao rang* 劳攘.\n\nWhen cleverness and skill abound, the people grow harder to govern.\nThus, governing with cleverness becomes the state’s undoing.\nFor when rulers and subjects alike rely on cunning,\nChaos takes root—\nHence: *\"To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;\nTo govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.\"*\n\nThese two refer to wisdom and its absence.\nTo know that cleverness is ruinous and simplicity is blessing—\nThis too can serve as a law for the world.\nTo grasp this law is to possess *Xuan Miao* 玄妙’s virtue.\n\n*\"Profound and distant\"*—words of exaggerated praise.\n*Fan* 反 is *fu* 复—\nTo reverse and restore with all things, seeking their origin,\nIs to return to *Da Shun*, the great harmony—\n*Harmony* being *naturalness* itself.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Six: The King of All Valleys**\nThe rivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they excel in humility—\nThus they reign as kings of all valleys.\n\nTherefore, the Sage who would lead the people\nMust speak to them in humility;\nWho would go before the people\nMust place themselves last.\n\nThus, the Sage stands above yet the people do not feel burdened,\nGoes before yet the people do not feel harmed.\nThus, all under heaven willingly follow without exhaustion.\n\nBecause they do not contend,\nNone under heaven can contend with them.\n\nAll valley waters converge at the rivers and seas.\nThough the rivers and seas are exalted over all valleys,\nThey dwell beneath them—\nThis is a metaphor drawn from things.\nThe self-humiliated are exalted by others,\nThe self-last are honored as first.\n\nTo speak in humility—\nAs when one says, *\"Even a foolish man and woman can surpass me.\"*\nTo place oneself last—\nAs when one defers to the multitude, following others.\n\nThe Sage does not boast of leading the people,\nNor does He seek to go before them—\nRather, this is His way.\n\nThe intent is: Even the Sage, though desiring to lead and go first,\nStill acts thus—\nHow much more so others?\nThe phrasing is slightly exaggerated in its emphasis.\n\nThough the Sage stands above all under heaven,\nThe people do not feel oppressed.\nThough He goes before all under heaven,\nThe people do not feel harmed.\nAll under heaven gladly follow without weariness,\nFor the Sage follows the Way of non-contention—\nThus none under heaven can contend with Him.\n\n*\"Not burdened\"* means *\"not weary\"*—\nThree *\"is with\"* clauses, as in the *Systematic Classic*’s repeated *\"is because.\"*\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Seven: All Under Heaven Speaks**\nAll under heaven says, *\"He is great yet seems unworthy.\"*\nOnly because He is great does He seem unworthy.\nIf He were worthy for long, He would be petty.\n\nI possess three treasures—treasures to hold:\nFirst, *ci* 慈—compassion;\nSecond, *jian* 俭—frugality;\nThird, *not daring to lead all under heaven.*\n\nCompassion makes one courageous,\nFrugality makes one expansive,\nNot daring to lead all under heaven makes one the vessel and leader.\n\nNow, abandon compassion yet cling to courage,\nAbandon frugality yet cling to expansion,\nAbandon lastness yet cling to first—\nThis is death.\n\nCompassion in war brings victory,\nIn defense brings security.\nWhen Heaven would save them, it shields them with compassion.\n\n*\"Great yet seems unworthy\"*—this was a saying of the time,\nThus Laozi cites it as metaphor, echoing the earlier *\"barren valleys, orphans, widows.\"*\n\n*\"All under heaven says\"*—meaning this was a common phrase of the age.\n\nOnly because He is *great* does He seem unworthy—\nThe most exalted must act with the most humble heart.\n*Xiao* 肖 is *xiang* 象—\nSeemingly without likeness, yet embodying the small.\n\nIf one fancies themselves likened to anything,\nThey are petty, not of great measure.\n\nThese two lines clarify Laozi’s intent through contemporary speech.\nOne manuscript adds *\"dao\"* 道 after *\"predicates me\"* and *\"also\"* 也 after *\"petty,\"*—both errors.\n\nThe *three treasures*—their Way is precious and to be employed.\n*\"I possess\"*—what is noble in oneself.\nOnly compassion makes one courageous,\nOnly frugality makes one expansive,\nOnly not daring to lead makes one the leader of all under heaven.\n\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: *\"The Duke of Jin was expansive yet frugal.\"*\nThis directly applies the phrase.\n\n*Lian* 涟 is to gather the enemy,\n*Guang* 广 is to open and unfettered—\nAlso the meaning of *\"smallness precedes greatness.\"*\n\n*Qi* 器 is form—*cheng qi* 成器 is to take form.\nAll formed things on earth, I make their leader—\nThus: *\"to make form and lead.\"*\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion yet uses courage,\nAbandons frugality yet uses expansion,\nAbandons lastness yet uses first—\nThis is not the way to preserve oneself—\nThus: *\"Death.\"*\n\n*War* is to engage and move—\nAs Zhuangzi says: *\"To clash and contend, daily battling with the heart.\"*\n*Defense* is as Zhuangzi’s *\"pure qi guarding.\"*\nIf one takes compassion as master,\nExternally they can overcome things,\nInternally they can guard themselves—\nThus: *\"In war, they win; in defense, they hold firm.\"*",

rebuke for those today who cannot [do so].\n\nThe capable are guided by Heaven’s *zhōng* 诱#2 [intuition],\nWhile the incapable are deprived of Heaven’s oversight.\n\nEarlier, the Three Treasures were mentioned—here, one [treasure] is raised:\nIf one is compassionate, the other two are inherent within.\n\n**Chapter 68: The Virtuous Warrior**\nThe virtuous warrior is not martial,\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nThe skilled victor does not contend,\nThe skilled leader places others *below* them.\n\nThis is called the *virtue of non-contention*,\nThis is called the *strength of using others*,\nThis is called *harmonizing with Heaven*—the ancient pinnacle.\n\n*Shì* 士 are officers of the *shīshī* 士师 [ritual masters].\n*Wǔ* 武 means \"vigorous officials.\"\nTo establish *shì* with clear laws—why employ martial vigor?\nTo fight while enraged is to provoke the soldiers.\n\"Not to contend\" means not to oppose things directly.\nTo \"place others below\" echoes the earlier meaning of \"taking from the lowly to enrich the state.\"\n\nThe excellence of these four lies in the metaphor of non-contention.\nThe *virtue of non-contention* can harmonize with Heaven,\nCan bend collective strength to govern the world—\nFrom ancient times, nothing surpasses this, hence: *\"the ancient pinnacle.\"*\n\n**Chapter 69: The Art of War’s Sayings**\nThe art of war has sayings:\n*\"I dare not take the offensive but yield the initiative,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\n\nThis is called *\"moving without moving,\"*\n*\"Seizing without arms,\"*\n*\"Defeating without resistance,\"*\n*\"Grasping without weapons.\"*\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses one’s Treasures.\nThus, when armies clash, the first to engage wins.\n\nThose who speak of war’s art also cite contemporary sayings as metaphor.\nThe warrior does not dare take the offensive but yields the initiative,\nValues retreat over advance,\nMakes \"non-action\" into action,\nMakes \"non-seizing\" into seizing,\nMakes \"no resistance\" into resistance,\nMakes \"no weapons\" into weapons—\nAll are stratagems of feigning cowardice and weakness to deceive the enemy.\n\n*Rén* 仍 means \"to lure\"—to lure the enemy into battle.\nThus, such warfare holds the path to victory.\nIf one underestimates the enemy in arrogance, defeat is inevitable.\nNon-contention preserves the Treasures,\nBut underestimating the enemy to seek victory loses them.\n\nThus, when two warring states clash,\nThe side that *pities* (哀) always prevails.\n*Pity* means solemnly not rejoicing in war.\nDrums clash, soldiers leap into battle—\nThis is not *pity*.\n\nThis chapter entirely uses warfare to illustrate the *Dao*.\nBy extension, all such metaphors in the text follow this pattern.\n\n**Chapter 70: My Words Are Most Obvious**\nMy words are most obvious, most easy to act upon.\nYet none in the world can know them, none can follow them.\nSpeech has its *master* (宗),\nAffairs have their *lord* (君).\n\nOnly the ignorant fail to recognize me.\nFew know me, so I am honored.\nThus, the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade.\n\nMy words are most obvious, most easy to act upon,\nYet none in the world knows or follows them—\nThis is the world’s deception in not recognizing itself.\n\n*Zōng* 宗 is \"master,\" *jūn* 君 is also \"lord.\"\nAmong all speech, some words are supreme—hence, *\"speech has its master.\"*\nAll affairs under Heaven are governed by the *Dao*—hence, *\"affairs have their lord.\"*\n\nSince the world lacks those who know supreme speech and the *Dao*,\nNone recognize me—hence, *\"Only the ignorant fail to recognize me.\"*\nHaving said the world does not know me,\nYet *\"Few know me, so I am honored\"*—\nThis echoes the earlier meaning: *\"The unsmiled-upon is the *Dao*.\"*\n\nThe Sage’s *Dao* suffices within yet does not manifest externally—\nLike wearing coarse cloth while cherishing jade,\nSo none can see it.\n\n**Chapter 71: Knowing the Unknown**\nTo know the unknown is superior,\nTo not know the known is sickness.\nOnly by treating sickness as sickness\nDoes one not fall ill.\n\nThe Sage does not fall ill\nBecause they treat knowing as sickness—\nThus, they do not fall ill.\n\nAt the peak of knowledge, yet appearing ignorant—\nThis is the *Dao*’s summit.\n\nIn the unknowable, yet assuming knowledge—\nThis is the sickness of learning the *Dao*.\n\nIf one treats their knowing as sickness,\nThis sickness will vanish.\n\nThe Sage’s immunity to sickness lies in\nRecognizing knowing as sickness and treating it as such.\n\n*[Note: Some manuscripts incorrectly add \"矣\" to the first sentence—an error.]*\n\n**Chapter 72: The People Fear Not Authority**\nWhen the people fear not authority, *great authority* has arrived.\nDo not narrow their dwelling,\nDo not exhaust their sustenance.\n\nOnly by not exhausting does one not exhaust.\nThus, the Sage knows themselves yet does not reveal themselves,\nLoves themselves yet does not exalt themselves—\nHence, they discard the former to embrace this.\n\n*\"Those who do not fear punishment always meet it\"*—\nThe opening words are metaphor.\n\n*Jū* 居 means \"broad dwelling.\"\n*Shēng* 生 refers to the principle of longevity and vitality.\nAll narrow their dwellings, exhaust their sustenance—\nUnsettled in retreat yet obsessed with advancement,\nUnaware of emptiness yet bewildered by possession—\nThis is self-narrowing, self-exhausting.\n\n*\"Without\"* is a cautionary admonition: *\"Only this is possible.\"*\nOnly those who do not exhaust endure—\nHence, *\"Thus, only by not exhausting does one not exhaust\"*—\nA deduction from the following sentence.\n\nThough the Sage knows the *Dao*, they do not reveal it,\nYet they can obscure it.\nThough they love themselves, they do not exalt themselves,\nYet they can be humble and lowly.\n\nTo \"discard\" is to abandon the commoners’ narrow, exhausting hearts,\nTo \"take\" is to suffice in this *Dao*—\nHence, *\"take this.\"*\n\n**Chapter 73: Boldness in Daring**\nBoldness in daring leads to killing,\nBoldness in

decree.\n\nThough the Sage acts without contention,\nYet right and wrong, good and bad—\nNot a hair’s breadth may be disordered.\n\nThese lines again liken Heaven to the Way.\n\n---\n**Chapter 74: The People Do Not Fear Death**\n\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can you frighten them with fear?\n\nIf you make the people always fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely—\nI seize them and kill them—\nWho would dare?\n\nThere are always those entrusted with killing who kill.\nTo take the place of those entrusted with killing is like\nA substitute carpenter taking the chisel.\n\nA substitute carpenter rarely avoids injury to his hands.\n\nThis chapter speaks of distinguishing good and evil.\nSelf-made preferences, carried to extremes,\nAre not the Way of knowing—\nHence, it uses those who wield punishment as an analogy.\n\nThose who govern rely only on death to frighten the people,\nYet the people do not truly fear death.\nIf the people truly feared death,\nThen those who act strangely—\nI seize and punish them—\nThen none would dare.\n\nYet those who act strangely are still killed,\nAnd the people who transgress multiply—\nThus, the people do not truly fear death.\n\nThose entrusted with killing are the Creators.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, those who do good or evil,\nThere are always Creators who hold sway over life and death.\nThose who should be killed are killed by the Creators themselves—\nHence, *\"There are always those entrusted with killing who kill.\"*\n\nFor a state to be overly concerned with punishment\nIs to take the place of the Creators in killing.\nWith my clumsy hands replacing the Master Carpenter,\nFew escape uninjured—\nThis is a metaphor within a metaphor.\n\nThis chapter also arises from the times’ fondness for killing,\nYet its intent is not to abolish punishment entirely.\n\nHeaven punishes the guilty—\nOnly when there is no room for mercy.\n\n---\n**Chapter 75: The People’s Hunger**\n\nThe people’s hunger stems from their rulers taking too much in taxes.\nThe people’s difficulty in governing stems from their rulers’ excessive actions.\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life—\nThus, those who do not make life their concern\nAre wiser than those who prize life.\n\n*\"Too much in taxes\"* means taking excessively from the people.\n*\"Their rulers’ excessive actions\"* means those who govern overuse clever schemes.\nWhen rulers value profit, the people grow hungrier;\nWhen rulers favor cleverness, the people grow harder to govern—\nThese two lines are also metaphors.\n\nGenerally, when people overindulge in self-preservation,\nThey risk losing their lives.\nExcessive eating and drinking can bring illness—\nThis is one example.\n\nOverindulging in self-care to secure life—\nHence, *\"excessive pursuit of life.\"*\nTo recklessly risk one’s life to gain it—\nHence, *\"disregard for death.\"*\n\nTo forget the self is to preserve the self—\nHence, *\"those who do not make life their concern\nAre wiser than those who prize life.\"*\n\n*\"Prize life\"* is like the previous chapter’s *\"increase life\"*—\nThose who excessively pursue life.\n*\"Wiser\"* means *\"superior.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 76: The Nature of Life**\n\nWhen people are born, they are soft and weak;\nWhen they die, they become stiff and strong.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nWhen born, are soft and brittle;\nWhen dead, wither and decay.\n\nThus, the stiff and strong belong to death,\nThe soft and weak belong to life.\nHence, strong armies do not conquer,\nStrong trees are felled.\n\nThe strong are low, the weak are high.\n*\"Soft and weak,\" \"stiff and strong\"*—\nBoth are metaphors.\n\nLaozi’s teachings emphasize valuing the soft,\nThus, he uses the birth and death of people and plants as analogies.\n\n*\"Belong to\"* means *\"of the same kind.\"*\nFrom *\"Hence\"* onward, he again uses armies and trees as metaphors.\n\nArmies that rely on strength will not conquer;\nYoung trees are soft, but over time they grow stiff—\nBy the time they reach the thickness of a man’s arms,\nThey are near decay.\n\nThus, those who know the Way prize the soft and weak,\nAnd regard the stiff and strong as inferior.\n\n*\"Felled\"* refers to the felled tree’s curve.\n\n---\n**Chapter 77: The Way of Heaven**\n\nIs not the Way of Heaven like drawing a bow?\n\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised,\nThe excessive are diminished, the deficient are supplemented.\nHeaven’s Way diminishes the excessive and supplements the deficient,\nBut the Way of man is otherwise—\nThey diminish the deficient to serve the excessive.\n\nWho can serve the world with what is excessive?\nOnly those who follow the Way—\nHence, the Sage acts without claiming,\nCompletes without dwelling,\nAnd does not desire to be seen as virtuous.\n\nHeaven’s Way abhors excess and favors humility,\nLike a drawn bow—\nIf held too long, it must slacken.\n\nThe high must inevitably humble themselves,\nThe excessive must inevitably diminish,\nThe low must inevitably rise,\nThe bent must inevitably straighten,\nThe diminished must inevitably be replenished—\nThus, Heaven treats all things in this manner.",

strong,\nNone can surpass it—\n其无以易之。\nIts power cannot be replaced.\n\n弱之胜强，柔之胜刚，\nThe weak overcome the strong,\nThe gentle overcome the rigid—\n天下莫不知，\nAll under Heaven know this—\n莫能行。\nYet none can practice it.\n\n故圣人云：\nThus the Sage says:\n受国之垢，是谓社稷主；\n*\"Bear the world’s filth, and you may be called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.\"*\n受国之不祥，是谓天下王。\n*\"Bear the world’s misfortunes, and you may be called the King of the World.\"*\n\n正言若反。\nThis is inverted speech.\n\n水为至弱，而能攻坚强，\nWater is the most weak,\nYet it can overcome the hard and strong—\n世未有能胜之者。\nNo one in the world can surpass it.\n\n千金之堤，败於蚁穴之漏，\nA thousand-gold dam is ruined by a leak at the ant’s hole—\n是弱之胜强者。\nThis is the weak overcoming the strong.\n\n无以易於水也，\nNone can replace water—\n故曰其无以易之。\nHence it is said: Its power cannot be replaced.\n\n弱能胜强，柔能胜刚，\nThe weak can overcome the strong,\nThe gentle can overcome the rigid—\n如水之易见，\nAs clear as water—\n人莫不知之。\nYet none know how to do it.\n\n而至道在於能柔能弱者，\nThe ultimate Dao lies in those who can be gentle and weak—\n莫之能行也，\nYet none can practice it—\n故古之圣人常有言曰：\nThus the ancient Sages often say:\n能受一国之垢者，方可为社稷主，\n*\"Only those who can bear a nation’s filth\nMay become its Lord of Soil and Grain.\"*\n能受一国之不祥者，方可为天下王。\n*\"Only those who can bear a nation’s misfortunes\nMay become the King of the World.\"*\n\n此即知其荣，守其辱之意。\nThis is the meaning of *\"knowing its glory yet holding to its shame.\"*\n\n不祥者，不美之名也。\n*\"Misfortune\"* is the name for what is not beautiful.\n\n盖位至高者，不可与天下求胜，\nFor those in the highest position,\nThey cannot vie with the world for victory—\n须能忍辱，则可以居人之上。\nThey must endure shame,\nThen they may stand above others.\n\n垢与不祥，不可受之受也，\nTo bear filth and misfortune\nIs not the kind of bearing others speak of—\n似反一世之常言，\nIt seems contrary to the common speech of the age—\n其实正论，\nYet it is true doctrine—\n故曰正言若反。\nHence it is said: This is inverted speech.\n\n圣人云三字自佳，\nThe Sage’s three words are excellent—\n一本以云为言误也。\nBut the original text mistakenly used *\"cloud\"* instead of *\"say.\"*\n\n---\n\n**和大怨章第七十九**\n**Chapter 79: Reconciling Great Grievances**\n\n和大怨，必有余怨，\nTo reconcile great grievances\nMust inevitably leave lingering grievances—\n安可以为善？\nHow can this be called good?\n\n是以圣人执左契，\nThus the Sage holds onto the left contract—\n而不责於人。\nYet does not demand it of others.\n\n有德司契，无德司彻。\nThe virtuous govern the contract,\nThe lacking govern the clarity.\n\n天道无亲，常与善人。\nHeaven’s Way has no favorites—\nIt always aids the virtuous.\n\n恩怨两忘，方知至道。\nOnly when one forgets both kindness and grievances\nDoes one truly know the ultimate Dao.\n\n人有大怨於我，\nWhen others hold great grievances against me—\n而必欲与之和，\nYet I must desire to reconcile with them—\n虽无执怨之心，\nThough I have no lingering resentment—\n犹知怨之为怨，\nI still recognize grievance as grievance—\n则此心亦未化矣。\nThen this heart has not yet been transformed.\n\n虽曰能与之和，\nThough I say I can reconcile with them—\n此心未化，\nThis heart has not yet been transformed—\n则余怨尚在，\nSo lingering grievances still remain—\n安得谓之善道，\nHow can this be called the Good Way?\n此诚至理之言，亦借喻也。\nThis is indeed a profound truth, a metaphor as well.\n\n左契者，\nThe left contract—\n如今人合同文字也，\nLike today’s written agreements—\n一人得左，一人得右，\nOne party keeps the left half, the other the right—\n故曰左契。\nHence it is called the left contract.\n\n此契在我，\nIf this contract is with me—\n则其物必可索，\nThen I can demand its fulfillment—\n圣人虽执此契，\nYet the Sage, though holding this contract—\n而不以索於人，\nDoes not demand it of others—\n忘而化也，\nForgetting and transforming it—\n此亦借喻之语。\nThis too is metaphorical speech.\n\n有德者则司主此契而无求索之心，\nThe virtuous govern the contract\nYet have no desire to demand its fulfillment—\n无德者则以明白为主。\nThe lacking use clarity as their guide.\n\n彻，明也，\n*\"Clarity\"* means clarity—\n犹今人言必与之讨分晓也。\nLike how people today say they must demand an explanation.\n\n有德司契者，善人也。\nThose who govern the contract with virtue are good people.\n\n天虽无私亲，而此等有德之人，\nThough Heaven has no partial favorites,\nYet these virtuous people—\n天必佑之，\nHeaven will surely protect them—\n故曰常与善人。\nHence it is said: Heaven always aids the virtuous.\n\n---\n\n**小国寡民章第八十**\n**Chapter 80: Small States and Few People**\n\n小国寡民，\nSmall states, few people—\n使有什伯人之器而不用，\nLet them possess the tools of a hundred men yet not use

delightful.\n\n邻国相望，鸡狗之声相闻，\nNeighboring states are visible,\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard—\n民至老死不相往来。\nYet the people do not visit one another\nEven until old age and death.\n\n小国寡民，\nSmall states, few people—\n犹孟子言得百里之地，皆可以朝诸侯，\nLike Mencius saying: *\"With a hundred-li territory,\nOne can attend the feudal lords\"*—\n一天下之意。\nOr rule the world.\n\n老子盖曰，\nLaozi says:\n有道之人若得至小之国，\nIf a Daoist person gains a very small state—\n不多之民井而居之，\nAnd few people as their well—\n使有什伯，\nLet them possess the tools of a hundred men—\n如今人之保伍也，\nLike how people today keep their reserves—\n人人皆有可用之器，\nEach person has tools that can be used—\n而不求自用。\nYet they do not seek to use them themselves.\n\n是人皆有士君子之行，\nThese are people who all possess the conduct of a scholar-gentleman—\n而安於自退也。\nYet they are content with self-withdrawal.\n\n重死而不远徙，\nThey value death over distant migration—\n小人皆畏罪不为恶，\nThe petty fear punishment and do not commit evil—\n而各安其居也。\nYet each remains secure in their own home.\n\n虽有舟舆，无所乘之，\nThough they have boats and carriages,\nThey do not ride them—\n不致远以求利也。\nNot traveling far to seek profit.\n\n虽有甲兵而不陈列，\nThough they have armor and weapons,\nThey do not display them—\n不恃力以求胜也。\nNot relying on strength to seek victory.\n\n合书契而用结绳，\nUsing written contracts yet returning to knotted cords—\n复於素朴也。\nReturning to simplicity and purity.\n\n甘食美衣，安居而乐俗，\nSweet food, beautiful clothing,\nSecure homes and delight in customs—\n邻国虽近，\nNeighboring states, though close—\n鸡狗之声虽相闻，\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs, though heard—\n而老死不相往来，\nYet the people do not visit one another\nEven until old age and death—\n各自足而不相求也。\nEach is self-sufficient and does not seek from others.\n\n此老子因战国纷争，\nThis is what Laozi reflects upon,\nAmidst the chaos of the Warring States—\n而思上古淳朴之俗，\nAnd ponders the simple and pure customs of antiquity—\n欲复见之也。\nDesiring to see them restored.\n\n观其所言，亦有自用之意。\nLooking at his words,\nThere
