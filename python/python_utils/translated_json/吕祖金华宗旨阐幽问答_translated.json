  "full_translation": "**The Venerable Lü’s Exposition on the Golden Flower: Clarifying the Obscure in Dialogue**\n*By Qing Hui Jue*\n\n**Question:** The study of the primordial is of the heart-mind; the study of the postnatal is of traces. To escape the cycle of rebirth, must one cultivate in the formless?\n\n**Answer:** There is no way to cultivate in the formless. How, then, is cultivation to be done? One might suppose stillness yields attainment, while movement loses it. Yet they do not know that the loss in movement arises from the failure to attain in stillness. If stillness yields no attainment, movement incurs loss—both stem from not having penetrated the Dao. What you speak of as \"above form\" merely describes what ought to be, not how it comes to be. At present, one can only seek the traceless within traces. Within traces, the traceless is found: the deluded wander a thousand miles, while the awakened arrive in a single morning.\n\n**Further Question:** What does it mean to seek the traceless within traces?\n\n**Answer:**\n*In vain do men sigh, learning the arts of the fair maid;*\n*Seeking fragrance in subtlety, all remains one-sided.*\n*Not recognizing the central within the central, ever more central,*\n*The true mystery arises where no cause is given.*\n\n**Question:** How does the heart-mind attain stillness?\n\n**Answer:** To exhaustively investigate all things is difficult; to preserve it moment by moment is easy. Preservation means preserving the heart-mind. Only when the heart-mind is preserved does it have a master; only with a master can affairs be governed. Between a single grasp and a single release lies the division between heaven and humanity, the distinction between worthiness and foolishness—this cannot be taken lightly. Yet preserving the heart-mind is easily interrupted; with long practice, it becomes unbroken. Unbroken, it continues; continuing, it becomes luminous; luminous, qi is full. When qi is full, dullness and dispersion are dispelled without being dispelled.\n\nAlas! Among all matters under heaven, only this is great—all else is but trifling. Amidst a hundred busynesses, preserve a single inch; within ten thousand affairs, hold to one principle. Without embodying these two sayings, one will never enter the realm of the sages.\n\n**Question:** What of observing the heart-mind?\n\n**Answer:** Observe the heart-mind in clarity and stillness. The heart-mind is fundamentally non-dual, only the one pure and true. Extending before and behind, there is nothing else—it does not depart from the conditions of seeing and hearing, yet transcends them to ascend the Buddha’s ground.\n\nYet the observation of the heart-mind has depths: there is forced observation and natural observation; observation beyond the dust and within the dust; observation neither within nor without; and all-encompassing observation. Which will you observe?\n\nMy Way proceeds step by step, never skipping stages. Yet in the beginning and end of one’s practice, it does not exceed this: the starting hand is the finishing hand. Cultivation begins with observation—this is the work. When observation deepens and delusion is purified, true emptiness is attained. If one merely speaks of the principle of emptiness without engaging in observation and practice, it is but \"lip Chan.\" The ordinary person remains ordinary—what is the point of cultivation?\n\n**Question:** What of turning the light around to illuminate?\n\n**Answer:** *\"Without illumination, how can one see?\"*\n\nWithout the raft, none can cross. Yet it is not by rejecting the raft that one crosses—crossing is the very act of crossing. The raft remains a raft; seeing the raft as no-raft, one knows crossing is not crossing.\n\nTurning the light around is not done with the eyes, but with the heart—heart is the eye. With long and steady concentration, the heart and eye become luminous. Those who have not realized this find it hard to speak of, for to do so risks the flaw of clinging to form. Failure to realize arises from depleted essence. Observe the heart’s awakened aperture to generate essence; as essence slightly congeals, it reveals itself, and the wondrous gateway of the Mysterious Pass appears. Only then does the work of inquiry and awakening find its ground—otherwise, it is but vague talk, and speaking of it brings only shame at deceiving others.\n\nAlas! The Great Dao is profound and truly hard to speak of—step by step, one reaches the blossoming flower. Within the flower is fruit, yet no fruit; this is how the ordinary person transcends the postcelestial.\n\nWithout vastness, the thousand ten-thousand subtle and graceful wisdoms would not arise. The Dharma seat is boundless in depth, and the teaching knows no limit. Wait until you have cultivated day by day, month by month, until the heart opens and the Buddha is seen—only then will you know that the dragon’s deep repose has not deceived me.\n\nAs for gazing at the navel, that is external work. The inner work arises when heart and eye are born—this is the true Elixir Field. Left-turning and right-turning share the same principle. The *Elixir Classic* says: *\"What is done by nature cannot be a deviant or false path.\"*\n\nSome see light before their eyes—this is the light of mice, not the light of tiger’s eyes or dragon’s essence. The light of the heart belongs neither to inner nor outer. If you see it with the eyes of form, it is already demonic. You have been defiled for so long that its true nature is hard to purify all at once.\n\nThe matter of life and death is grave. With a single thought, turn the light around, gather your spirit, and concentrate the illumination on your own heart—this is the Buddha-lamp. A house full of wealth is yours only if you recognize it truly; if not, how much can you truly absorb?\n\nThis matter of mine startles even gods and ghosts—only one of virtue can bear it. What is the Buddha-lamp? To keep it ever burning is the Buddha-lamp. Better than lighting lamps inside and outside the house to offer me is this single lamp, undimmed through the night, illuminating the five aggregates as empty—only then will you know the One Who Saves from Suffering, the Compassionate Avalokiteśvara.\n\nThe heart-lamp is possessed by all; merely light it brightly, and you become the immortal Great Immortal. Do not forget this heart, lest your spirit grow dim and masterless, scattering your essence.\n\nThis teaching directly reveals the essential principle of the Great Vehicle, a practice of sudden entry. The turning of the light is the clear state after death, not only in the present. I must press myself to speak of it so that you may generate faith—yet this is a great leak of heavenly mechanism.\n\nFollow this path, and without seeking results, results will come of themselves. Only then will your lifelong study be truly connected. Do not be like those who wander east today and west tomorrow, spouting wild fox Chan and calling it done.\n\n**Question:** What is the path to bodhi that leads home?\n\n**Answer:** You have never left home—only your own heart’s delusion has made south into north, turning a single step into a thousand-mile journey. In truth, it is right here. The jewel in your robe is still your own treasure.\n\nA single thought turning the light—this is already on the bodhi path, with home close at hand. The finest monastery need not be sought elsewhere; without leaving the household life, this very place is a forest grove. My mind-to-mind transmission of this Dharma is a practice of sudden entry in one leap, called \"preserving the root in cultivation.\" Those who gather power will unfold the vast brilliance of heaven and earth—nothing rare in this. Even those of shallow capacity and inferior roots will not lose the station of minor immortals or minor deities. Let all of you take this in.\n\n**Question:** Should one begin with the study of inherent nature?\n\n**Answer:** The study of inherent nature cannot be completed without the study of life-destiny. First, from nature, one probes to draw forth the workings of destiny; only when destiny is penetrated can nature be thoroughly realized. Nature without destiny is not thorough; destiny without nature is not complete. Thus the *Yijing* says: *\"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\"* Having fulfilled nature, how then does one reach destiny? Without plumbing the depths to the very end, how can one know that the numinous treasure lies hidden here? It can give life to people, it can kill people—life and death rest solely in this, not in some other mysterious gateway.\n\n**Question:** May one abide in the nature of true thusness?\n\n**Answer:** How can the nature of true thusness be abided in? Since it is said to be thus—living, vivid, and thus—how can it tolerate conceptualization? If even conceptualization is impossible, how can it be abided in? Not abiding, yet abiding—there is nothing to abide in. To abide is to grasp and hold; true thusness does not appear. Do not cling. The four great elements are fundamentally empty; the five aggregates are not substantial. Where is there room for you to grope and seize?\n\n**Question:** Should one focus the mind in one place?\n\n**Answer:** To focus the mind in one place is certainly so, yet the mind has no fixed place and must be lively and fluid. True discernment does not lie in form or appearance; form and appearance belong to the acquired. Knowing is the function of the mind; emptiness and stillness are its essence. If one clings to the acquired, then the qi-nature dominates, principle is not exhausted, and realization cannot be attained.\n\n**Question:** If the mind is not focused in one place, how can one gain mastery?\n\n**Answer:** Transcending movement and stillness, one gains mastery; having no mastery is itself mastery. Do not be reckless. Drifting and floating, the manifestations of thunder, rain, wind, and clouds appear—creation’s workings are all revealed, living and vivid. This is not ordinary, yet it is ordinary. Heavenly flowers scatter in profusion; all the gods offer auspicious signs—truly worthy of celebration. Swiftly, in this lifetime, one resolution settles a hundred matters. Lifting the gaze, the great Dharma realm of divine light arises—all fruition emerges in a single radiance. What need is there to speak of clarity and brightness? Do not grasp. Examine carefully.\n\nGrasping only drives it farther away—fire blazes while water withers, water and fire unbalanced, how can the divine elixir endure? The Daoist speaks with bone-deep truth, no deception or force. You must keenly embody this: the great Dao lies before you, no need to wait for another life. In an instant, radiant light pervades, the five aggregates dissolve, and the world unfolds like a palm.\n\n**Question:** Does spirit enter qi?\n\n**Answer:** How could it enter? Spirit does not enter qi—it is nowhere absent. What is called \"spirit entering qi\" refers to the acquired spirit, not the primordial spirit’s path. In the foundational work, qi is the heart—discern this carefully, for it is the opening of the mysterious pass. If you force it, you carve; what you carve is not the opening of the mysterious pass but the qi of the entire body, fraught with danger—this must not be overlooked. The mysterious pass is the very center of heaven and earth. Within the aperture lies another aperture, yet there is no place to point. If there were a place to point, it would remain within the five agents of creation—how could it transcend creation? The mysterious learning does not fall into creation yet contains creation. Without personal realization through practice, one cannot speak of it phrase by phrase. The golden needle fits each sentence perfectly—silent comprehension suffices, no need for excessive words.\n\n**Question:** What of spirit and qi?\n\n**Answer:** Spirit has no substance; spirit is qi, and spirit and qi cannot be separated. Without qi, spirit has no ground to stand, nor can qi exist without it. The movement of qi is the movement of spirit.\n\n**Question:** If spirit and qi cannot be separated, why do Daoists speak of refining qi to transform into spirit?\n\n**Answer:** It means preserving clarity and shedding turbidity. Only clarity is numinous. Spirit is the clear aspect of qi. As for refining spirit to return to emptiness—is emptiness not qi? Qi is spirit, and spirit moves through qi, which is also called returning to its source.\n\n**Question:** What of using qi to resonate with qi?\n\n**Answer:** Using qi to resonate with qi is so. Yet if you refer to the qi within the human body, it is either true or ordinary and cannot be employed. When will you ascend to the immortal realm? It is not this insubstantial qi, untouchable as the faintest flicker of the heart. As for minor techniques of circulating qi, they may cultivate the physical body and prolong life, but if one insists that the great Dao must be practiced upon the physical body, such words belong to side paths. Even a slight attachment is not the Way. It must arise from non-attachment, transforming through illusion into function—not this kind of talk, but that kind of practice. The luminous Dharma realm allows no room for sentiment. The Buddha’s words are pleasing to the ear, the immortals’ music harmonious—pity that none understand, for there is no kindred spirit. In sum, external practices have no bearing on the great Dao. True cultivation of the Dao begins with refining essence into qi—this essence is not the essence of intercourse, as the alchemical texts have made abundantly clear. This first stage is already difficult to explain, let alone the matters of the second and third passes. The great Dao is profound, not a jest.\n\nSome, upon entering the path, mistake it for the ultimate end, unaware of what lies beyond the exit, or how to exit and re-enter.\n\n**Question:** What of cultivation?\n\n**Answer:** To cultivate is to remove defilement. Without defilement, what need is there for cultivation? To cultivate further is to place a head upon a head.\n\n**Question:** How to recognize it?\n\n**Answer:** To recognize is to recognize the essence. The essence of the heart is formless; recognition is the practice. Recognize one part, and you accumulate one part. Accumulate depth, and radiance flows—then the Dao is before your eyes. You still seek the essence through function; only when the essence manifests will wondrous function arise. Wondrous function reveals the essence, yet people remain unaware.\n\n**Question:** The three powers establish the pole—what is the human pole?\n\n**Answer:** The human pole lies in the heart, which is the heart of heaven. In humans, it is called human; in heaven, it is called heaven. The Lord oversees you—there is no second heart. The original heart connects to heaven, thus to the Lord. A single thought of resonance, and you join the ranks of immortals. You are unlearned, and I am ashamed I have not taught you. I shall now reveal what I have concealed.\n\nWhat is spoken of is called the Supreme Ultimate. The principle of the Supreme Ultimate pervades heaven and humanity. Heaven is founded upon it to establish the pole of yin and yang, and the ceaseless mechanism of generation originates here. Humans possess this principle, yet it is obscured by selfishness, so its principle does not manifest, leaving only its substance. In movement and stillness, they lean and falter, unaware, drifting through years and months, flowing heedlessly, unrestrained and reckless, vanishing in an instant without return.\n\nAlas! A single flash of red light, and all dissolves like ice—none know where it has gone. As the saying goes: \"The scholar aspires to be a worthy, the worthy to be a sage.\" To return is to rely on the extension of knowledge. The essence of extending knowledge lies in the heart. When the heart is pure and sincere, one advances ceaselessly; when the heart is tainted and scattered, one drifts without end.\n\nAlas! Alas!\n\nYou, my disciples, have attended me for long, yet I dared not directly reveal the essence. For those who cultivate stillness and reverence are few, and those who embody sincerity and unity are rare—thus the Dao does not manifest without cause. Amidst the clamor of wind and rain, human affairs drift idly; when expounding profound truths, much is but empty verbiage in the void. Without accumulated virtue, one has no refuge, so they treat worldly affairs as a ladder—when the moment is ripe, they ascend; when it is not, they remain mired in red dust. Heaven and Earth are impartial—why scheme with cunning? You may attend to matters, but ensure your spirit does not scatter. Like a roaring fire in the furnace, only with focused intent can you enter the path of bodhi and realize nirvana. Otherwise, your discourse will be vague, your purpose obscure, and you will not grasp the true source of your own nature and life—how then can you progress?\n\n**Question:** In all subtle cultivation, must one seek what is constant and personally relevant?\n**Answer:** What cultivation? It is not in action yet profoundly present, not in solemnity yet reverent. With steadfast devotion, one holds fast to oneself—manifest and hidden unite, substance and function are undivided. Where is the effort, and where is it not? The great Dao is silent and yielding, ever fitting, ever at peace in all things.\n\n**Question:** I only know stillness as substance and movement as function, the manifest as evident and the hidden as concealed. Divided thus, I cannot unite them as one. You previously taught \"manifest and hidden unite, substance and function are undivided\"—does this refer to the formless?\n**Answer:** Within form lies the formless; within the \"center,\" there is neither \"form\" nor \"formless.\" The center within the center—internally examine the undividedness of substance and function, seek the unfathomable in the hidden and manifest.\n\n**Question:** You taught that \"not in action yet profoundly present, not in solemnity yet reverent\" means effort is everywhere and nowhere—is this the unity of manifest and hidden, the undividedness of substance and function? If we speak of what flows, clearly there is movement and stillness. Is it that movement and stillness are natural, and their unity lies in desirelessness? Or is it that the myriad changes cannot escape the vastness of the Great Void, hence their unity and undividedness?\n**Answer:** Waves arise in water—are waves not water? Though outwardly moving, inwardly they contain stillness. The wave is the wave, the water is the water—thus it is. Concealed within, expressed without—how can they not be called united, undivided?\n\n**Question:** Is it by preserving the heart to extend knowledge?\n**Answer:** What is there to preserve?\n\n**Question:** When knowledge is extended, the mirror is bright; when the mirror is bright, stains appear. Not even the slightest obscurity remains—what is illuminated is fully revealed, and dregs dissolve entirely.\n**Answer:** Its nurturing and its harm both lie herein. Examine within: there is no single master. Like the sun and moon’s cycles, the cold and heat’s fixed seasons, the four seasons’ alternation, the eight nodes’ rise and fall—when harmonized within this, the year’s work is complete, and movement proceeds without hindrance. Herein lies the establishment of destiny, the dwelling of nature. You must burn incense and quietly verify—with time, you will gain insight. Long anchored on rivers and lakes, clouds veil the western mountains. Yet when the sun rises, it is the appointed hour.\n\n**Question:** To be vigilant and earnest *is* the original substance; the original substance is inherently vigilant and earnest. Aligning with this original substance *is* the work of cultivation—what is called \"unmoving yet subtle, unsolemn yet reverent.\" Viewed in terms of its clarity, it is called *knowledge*; viewed in terms of its discernment, it is called *reverence*; viewed in terms of its absence of delusion, it is called *sincerity*; viewed in terms of the life-principle inherent within, it is called *benevolence*; viewed in terms of its indivisibility into inner and outer, its lack of distinction between movement and stillness, its boundlessness as the Supreme Ultimate, it is called *the One*. With steadfast reverence, the world is at peace. *The Mean* is harmony; speak of the Mean, and harmony is already within it; speak of harmony, and the Mean need not be mentioned. In movement, there is nothing that is not harmonious—thus in stillness, there is nothing that is not centered. Inner and outer are one, head upright and tail straight?\n\n**Answer:** Speak of it constantly, practice it constantly. Ordinary words, ordinary deeds—perfect sincerity without delusion. The three schools’ deepest secrets require no further discourse.\n\n**Question:** Yesterday, you spoke of the mirror’s brightness revealing stains, and you instructed: \"Its nurturing and its harm both lie herein.\" Does this mean that both self-cultivation and introspection arise from this, as do the distractions of desires and splendor? Is this the *yin spirit* of unrefined essence, what the Buddhists call *seed-nature*?\n\n**Answer:** Will you doubt it? Or will you believe it? There is a clear and open great path—when you reach that point, you will naturally advance. With time, the seed-nature will transform into Buddha-nature.\n\n**Question:** By tracing the root, can one attain sudden awakening?\n\n**Answer:** Seeking the root and probing to the depths, you reach the sea’s edge—there, a yaksha appears. Only when *yin* is at its extreme can *yang* be born. Before reaching the utmost *yin*, the source cannot be penetrated. To explore the root is precisely the wondrous method of neither clinging to emptiness nor to existence. This is my singular transmission—it penetrates heaven and earth, bringing boundless joy in the Great Dao. The *yang spirit* pervades the universe; in one breath, it drinks the waters of the Jiangxi. The lion leaps forth from its den, and the myriad beasts fall silent in awe. Hmph! What are the petty paths and side doors worth hearing? I tell you: set aside all talk of the fleshly body. Follow this and delve into the heart’s source—this is seeking the mystery in the *Kan* palace, where the water-dwelling dragon emerges. Without probing the waters, without investigating the source, it is all mere surface upon surface. To speak of the Dao to others is but to seek an empty reputation—what is called \"hanging up a sign to practice,\" the great taboo of my school. In this inquiry, you must truly inquire; in this awakening, you must truly awaken. Penetrating heaven and earth, all is the *Dharmakāya*, all is the radiance of my nature.\n\n**Question:** *Kan* and *Li*?\n\n**Answer:** They are the transformations of the primordial, neither deliberate nor silent. Even half a word of this mystery—if you grasp it, you attain the true and constant; if you do not, it remains useless. It is like handling affairs: one must find the right person, someone of balanced use, for the task to succeed. Otherwise, east and west remain divided—wood three, metal four—how can the depths be fathomed? This is bone-deep counsel; do not neglect it!\n\n**Question:** When thoughts swarm in confusion, one thought has not ceased before another arises—like a fish gulping water, mouth in, gills out; like the summer solstice, days long and nights short. If one cannot even fix one’s gaze on the wondrous *mysterious female* aperture, how can one hope for the true mechanism’s opening and closing, smooth as silk and continuous as floss?\n\n**Answer:** The mind-ground’s brightness illuminates past and present—how can you say the *mysterious female* has no root? With long and subtle practice, you will fully recognize *yin* and *yang* as the mechanism’s precursor.\n\n**Question:** Without the sun and moon, heaven and earth remain hidden; when the sun and moon withdraw, heaven and earth become chaotic. When spirit and *qi* unite, *qi* congeals and spirit coagulates—is this the union of *Kan* and *Li*?\n\n**Answer:** *Kan* and *Li* unite in the realm of the unknowing and unaware, yet their movement never ceases for even a moment. The Way of Heaven is ever-shifting, its wonder lying in its unforced harmony, not in deliberate action. Life and death are surely in Heaven’s hands—does Heaven have a mind?\n\n**Question:** The union of *Kan* and *Li* occurs within, and from this the great medicine is born. A single spark of the original nature glimmers faintly, concealed in the *Kun* belly. Its light pierces the curtains, pure and free of dust. Breath settles, *qi* calms, and only empty clarity remains—is this the heart of heaven and earth, governing the myriad transformations?\n\n**Answer:** When *qi* calms and breath settles, this is the principle of the mechanism’s revival—hence its liveliness, what is commonly called the *living midnight hour*.\n\n**Further Question:** From this subtlety to full manifestation, it corresponds to the three *yang* of the *Qian* hexagram. When the three *yang* retreat, they become three *yin*—this is the *small celestial cycle*. Re-entering the womb, nature returns to destiny. When stored long and released suddenly, fierce fire soars. This is fire’s dryness, which may stir the post-heaven emotions. Thus, one draws in and closes to prevent danger, causing it to descend without generating; one gathers and licks to assist the fire, causing it to ascend, clear and indestructible. This is the *great union*, the matching of true mercury. Emptiness *is* true mercury, *is* nature’s emptiness. Their union occurs within and beyond—from this, one retreats the tally and conceals it in the earthen crucible, refining it again and again, preserving clarity and discarding turbidity, until reaching the ultimate void. Is this the *absolute learning without care*?\n\n**Answer:** If you do not address the root, how can you order the branches? Wind, rain, thunder, clouds—who governs them?\n\nWho can halt or restrain it? Cultivating the self is like holding jade—grinding its flaws, chiseling its blemishes. The work runs deep, the effort accumulates, and its luster is not achieved in a single moment; without great power, this cannot be accomplished. To change morning and evening, stirred by a fleeting impulse, is to let qi settle in one corner. This is what is meant by jade with a blemish—once stained, cleansing is difficult. Strive with all your might: Kan and Li are what give rise to Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are what name Kan and Li. Kan and Li are what transform Qian and Kun.\n\n**Question:** When the topmost gate’s bolt is stirred, it suddenly opens and closes of its own accord—sometimes thus, sometimes not thus; not thus within thus. Does this reach the intent? Does it follow the flow of Heaven’s mandate? At this moment, the Dao-eye is clear and bright, Heaven opens the realm of longevity, all things manifest in full, vast and profound. The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye, the wondrous mind of Nirvana—ever more lively, ever more lucid. The *Elixir Classic* says: *\"Though he acts as host and I as guest, it is the external that becomes host, while I am reduced to guest.\"* Simply do not forget the illuminating mind, allowing it to transmute the yin within the abdomen—this may be called the Celestial King’s Heart-Supplementing Elixir. This is the essence of using spirit to guide qi, and qi to control essence. Is this not akin to the hawk seizing the swallow, the falcon striking the winter crow?\n\n**Answer:** A wondrous discourse indeed.\n\n**Further question:** Harmonizing light with dust yet remaining unstained, worldly affairs cannot cling to him. By its movement, it is called the River Chariot; by its non-violation of Heaven, it is called the Dharma Wheel. Round as an egg, white as silk, soft as cotton, light as a wave. When hard, it is an iron-spined man; when formed in sheets, it is like seawater soaking a dike; when it cannot contain itself, it overturns earth and lifts the sky. Rising as clouds, descending as rain, lightning flashes and thunder roars—addition and subtraction appear of their own accord. The dripping of the water clock, the primordial wine fit to taste; all such opportunities are but links in a single chain. Is it said that only with something can creation and transformation arise?\n\n**Answer:** It cannot be described, for description sets boundaries. Such profound talk cannot be taken as achievement. In sum: accumulate an inch, and it becomes an inch thicker; accumulate a foot, and it becomes a foot thicker. Square to resemble Earth, round to resemble Heaven—emptiness does not appear empty, fullness does not appear full. Emptiness and fullness are not distinct; everywhere, the marvelous arises. Not seeing is not the end, nor is seeing the finality. Ha-ha! A great laugh—utterly impenetrable.\n\n**Question:** In the dust yet beyond the dust.\n\n**Answer:** Not merely this—this is but the beginning stage. In the dust yet beyond the dust still leaves dust present; it is not causeless. When cause and effect shine as one, all is perfectly balanced—spring colors overflow the stream. What more can be said? Within wordlessness, jade-like words emerge.\n\n**Question:** Moving yet not moving, still yet not still—is this unity?\n\n**Answer:** Movement is not an obstacle, stillness is not stagnation. Movement is stillness, yet stillness is not movement. Movement and stillness unite—continuous and dense, a fine womb-breath.\n\n**Question:** What is continuous and dense?\n\n**Answer:** Ever more still, only then is it continuous and dense.\n\n**Question:** Does the heart follow movement and stillness in circulation?\n\n**Answer:** Whether the heart follows movement and stillness or not, it is circulation. The heart without heart—how can it be distinguished?\n\n**Question:** Then is there no distinction?\n\n**Answer:** Distinction is no distinction.\n\n**Question:** Is continuous and dense the true Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Continuous and dense must return to not continuous and not dense—step by step, the path to Tiantai.\n\n**Question:** The human body is entirely yin. Even when sitting in utter clarity, it is but the post-heaven yin soul subduing disease roots. A ladle of stagnant water—once stirred, it becomes turbid. To gather the heart in one place day and night only risks startling it at the slightest touch, turning it into a heart ailment. Why not, at the year’s end and the new year’s beginning, seek a message within the emptiness atop the Five Skandhas’ mountain? Those who grasp it live freely; those who do not merely toy with spirits.\n\n**Answer:** What can be known cannot be practiced; what can be practiced cannot be fully known.\n\n\"'Being and non-being give rise to each other'—hidden and manifest defy reckoning. Pitch-black, boundless white, transformation occurs in an instant—how could it be grasped by conjecture?\n\n**Question:** What is *bathing*?\n\n**Answer:** *Bathing* means to wash away filth. Roaming freely between heaven and earth, the heart’s field becomes vast and unobstructed; the numinous mechanism flows freely, and the myriad sensations all turn to emptiness. Alas! When man becomes heaven, and heaven becomes the unfathomable spirit—how wondrous, how mysterious!\n\nLight is the function of the heart; emptiness and stillness are its substance. If emptiness and stillness are not luminous, stillness is not true stillness, emptiness is not true emptiness—it is but a ghost’s den, and the Great Dao is not like this. Once the primordial essence is lost, there is no place to verify emptiness—truly, one falls into *emptiness and annihilation*.\n\nExternal paths speak of grinding the sun and moon at the world’s edge, or hanging one’s comings and goings in the grass, boasting of the vastness of the sea’s waters and the shimmer of a thousand acres of golden waves. The world is deluded by external paths and the comings and goings of ghosts’ dens—how difficult to change! You disciples, quietly uphold my Dao and do not let your hearts be shaken or confused.\n\nI wish for you to ascend to the supreme vehicle, not to descend into the middle or lower streams—the middle and lower streams are not the ultimate good. The ultimate good is limitless: in movement and stillness, no constancy; in spirit, unfathomable mystery. Though its substance is without distinction, its function manifests without fixed form. *'Before heaven, it does not oppose heaven; after heaven, it accords with heaven’s timing'*—the numinous brightness remains self-so.\n\n**Question:** Is *regulating the breath* the breath of the nostrils?\n\n**Answer:** The breath of the nostrils pertains to the external breath of the physical body. Only when heart and breath depend on each other is it the true breath. As the Venerable Prajñā said: *'The outgoing breath does not follow the myriad conditions; the incoming breath does not dwell in the skandha realm.'* How could this be the nostrils?\n\nThe opening and closing of the mechanism’s subtleties cannot be glimpsed in a single moment—it must be accumulated through long and strenuous effort. One day, it will suddenly penetrate through, and heaven and earth will be found to lie within. Man is the *'Great'*—the Three Powers stand as one, the myriad transformations share a single root. Do not seek it in the physical body, and the true breath will naturally appear. The true breath has no breath, yet breath exists—alas! The great mechanism is revealed!\n\nTo be *lively and free*—as for observing the breath or listening to the breath, these too pertain to the physical body. They are used to gather the heart, but they are not the true lifeline. The true lifeline must be sought from within the true. Observation and listening are one matter.\n\n**Question:** What about *regulating the breath as a practice*?\n\n**Answer:** Regulating the breath indeed involves practice, but the explanations are not uniform. There is external respiration and internal respiration; there is ordinary breath and spirit-breath. *Embryonic breathing* is spirit-breath—without breath, there is no embryo; without an embryo, there is no breath. The practice of embryonic breathing begins with the breath. If it is embryonic breathing, then *'the true person’s breath reaches the heels'*—how profound! These are words that hit the mark.\n\nDo not distinguish between internal and external—yet there is internal and external.\"\n\nThe distinction between internal and external refers to the three barriers; the absence of such distinction is the unity of movement and stillness. To become perfectly merged into one is called *transformation*. Without transformation, one cannot speak of the numinous, nor has one seen the Dao. Even if there are moments of awakening, they are but sunlight breaking through clouds—fleeting glimpses. The radiance of sun and moon illuminates all under heaven; this is no ghostly realm.\n\n**Question:** The embryo arises from breath. During the state of hibernation, it is *concealed qi*. Over time, external respiration ceases, leaving only internal respiration, and the golden embryo of the spirit-chamber coalesces within. Are such practices entirely the work of natural creation, not to be forced?\n\n**Answer:** It is inconceivable—suddenly entering the inconceivable is precisely this. It is not reckless disregard that makes it inconceivable. In the state of hibernation, the embryo is internal respiration. The work of penetrating the three teachings is what is called *spirit-breath*—the *wu* and *ji* of the center. What is external respiration worth mentioning? If the work is not yet complete, it lacks perfection; to abandon the ladder and ascend to heaven is to find the subtle mechanism hidden within the sage, where a single spark of numinous light shines forth in myriad forms.\n\n**Question:** Is this subtle mechanism *qi*?\n\n**Answer:** It is *qi*, and it must be nurtured with care. This is made clear—none of the scriptures dare speak of the apertures as the gateway.\n\n**Question:** When this subtle mechanism manifests in the central palace, what then?\n\n**Answer:** One phrase surpasses a hundred. There is authority and substance, illumination and application. Only when it touches the very itch does it become the language of attainment.\n*\"The utmost yin is solemn,\nThe utmost yang is blazing;\nSolemnity emerges from heaven,\nBlazing arises from earth.\"*\nThis is the teaching of *kan* and *li*.\n\n**Question:** Does spirit depend on form for its existence?\n\n**Answer:** Spirit does not depend on form. What do you take to be spirit? Penetrate this single word, and your entire being will be at peace.\n\n**Question:** What if spirit and *qi* are insufficient?\n\n**Answer:** Insufficiency of spirit and *qi* stems from long-standing depletion. Nurture them well, and when replenished, they will rise in brilliance. The dragon-tiger mystery-gate will suddenly appear, and you will realize that the three realms are but your own mind, while your mind transcends the three realms—yet contains them, perfectly interpenetrating and unobstructed. The compassionate light of all buddhas and immortals will bathe your crown, a rare and wondrous sight. This is the sign of a flourishing age, a scene of great peace—not entirely so, yet one part contains the whole. To achieve one part is to have one part unresolved, yet when one part is resolved, it remains but one part. How can peering through a narrow tube at the sky be considered attainment?\n\n**Question:** Are the five phases merely yin and yang, belonging to the postnatal?\n\n**Answer:** Does the prenatal lack the five phases? Only when the five phases are complete do the postnatal five phases arise. Without the prenatal five phases, from where would the postnatal five phases emerge? The essence of the Dao is formless, yet all phenomena are already inherent within it. While ancient and modern have their sequence, the principle of the five phases generating life knows no before or after.\n\n**Question:** Is harmony and smoothness *spirit-water*?\n\n**Answer:** It is not yet *spirit-water*. The wondrous function of spirit-water washes away the emptiness of nature; impurities dissolve, as gentle as spring wind. Whatever it touches is transformed, unbound by any cage.\n*\"In the empty mountains, do not stand idle;\nExotic flavors are spoken of as delicacies.\nSated to the bone, inscribed in heart and marrow,\nLet not the spirit-water flow in vain.\nA single drop returns to the root,\nAnd all things converge at the source.\nWhy trouble with other concerns?\nWhat cause is there for attachment?\"*\n\n**Question:** What of the *wu* and *ji* earths?\n\n**Answer:** A single ripple at the center divides into *wu* and *ji*, yet there is no gate.\n\n**Question:** What of refining the self to await the moment?\n\n**Answer:** Only by refining the self can one await the moment. Without refinement, there is no moment to await.\n\n**Question:** Are the *wu* and *ji* earths the wondrous function of the prenatal, the unity of the profound and the meditative?\n\n**Answer:** The wondrous function of the prenatal is not easily attained; it must be accumulated through postnatal effort. Only when human effort is exhausted does heavenly power arise—this is true practice, the very beginning of the bodhi path.\n\n**Question:** Is the great essential of the golden elixir found in the *wu* and *ji* earths, true yin and true yang, the true mystery and the true feminine? Without meeting this kindred force to apply the work, how can one gather the mechanism through mechanism? Transforming the mortal body, breaking through barriers and nodes—all depend on this great function manifesting. Like wind and clouds, thunder and rain, it harmonizes with creation, far beyond the reach of dry cultivation. Is this what is meant by harmonious union and gathering, ensuring certain accomplishment?\n\n**Answer:**\n*\"Dissimilar kinds cannot be forced to skill,\nTrue work is solid work.\nDistinguish the traces before your eyes,\nSeparation and union are one in the same.\"*\nWho perceives the wind, clouds, thunder, and rain within? Do not cling to phenomena—enter them, yet seek the phenomenon within phenomena, and know the mind within the mind.\n\n**Question:** Must one attain the great stillness of true emptiness before the self-earth can be called *ding*?\n\n**Answer:** The *wu* and *ji* earths have depth and shallowness. When fully penetrated, they are still *wu* and *ji*; when not fully penetrated yet treated as such, they remain *wu* and *ji*. In the great *ding* of true emptiness, the light of wisdom shines universally, and the fragrant sea observes the compassionate clouds.\n\n**Question:** Does the *ji* earth die so that the *wu* earth may live?\n\n**Answer:** The *ji* earth does not die. If the *ji* earth dies, the *wu* earth cannot live. The birth of *wu* is the life of *ji*—without this, nothing can be revealed.\n\n**Question:** Must the *ji* earth be refined to the point of utter detachment before the *wu* earth arises?\n\n**Answer:** Even so, once the *ji* earth is sufficiently refined, the *wu* earth immediately arises. Only when the *wu* earth is born can the yin stagnation within the *ji* earth be dissolved. Otherwise, it remains but a yin spirit—even with some attainment, it is merely a ghostly immortal, not the way of our teaching. Without drinking the returning-soul nectar, how can the yin *po* be dissolved and concealed? Most of you possess middling or lesser capacities; you must proceed step by step, not skipping stages. When the nature of heaven is seen, there is no constraint; without seeing the nature of heaven, you grope about like a barrel of black lacquer, blindly seeking direction. How can dry meditation without basis be considered lofty and transcendent?\n\nTo whom does one turn for counsel with keen wit and exceptional insight?\nEvery step taken leads only to boundless confusion.\nThe hollow sound of bamboo echoes beneath the moonlit night,\nYet without wind, how can it stir the nectar of dream-souls?\n\nMoon in water, flowers in a mirror—soundless, scentless.\nAll phenomena shine clearly in the human realm,\nNot some devious stream by the path that deludes and deceives.\nOur Way is to see nature and illumine the mind;\nIllumining the mind is precisely how one sees nature.\n\nThe Three Teachings converge as one, perfectly unobstructed.\nWith each measure of true guidance comes a measure of strict discipline—\nnot to be confused with the common herd.\nSages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas all place reverence and caution first.\nReverence and caution *are* the fundamental substance—there is no duality.\nTranscendence lies here—what need for so many words?\n\nAll that is spoken concerns the layers of practice,\neach dependent on the last, unchanging and untransformed.\nYet this still falls within the realm of ordinary beings,\nstill bound to the suffering of rebirth—not the supreme vehicle.\nIn the Great Veil, one act settles all; it is inherently consistent,\nnever deviating for even an instant.\n\nIn a single instant, transformation makes one an ordinary being;\nin a single instant, transformation makes one an immortal or buddha.\nThe divide between immortal and mortal, sage and fool,\nlies in but a single instant.\nInstant after instant—where are the immortals and buddhas?\nAll this is but the reluctant speech of the Daoist.\n\n**Question:** What of the primordial *qi* and the postnatal *qi*?\n\n**Answer:** The primordial *qi*, the postnatal *qi*—\nthose who attain it are ever as if intoxicated.\nAmitābha!\nWhen shall we know such boundless joy?\nPrimordial and postnatal are fundamentally without distinction;\nall that differentiates them is merely postnatal.\n\nTo distinguish is to sunder motion and stillness, rendering even the primordial *qi* transformed into the postnatal. To unite is to make the postnatal *qi* itself primordial, with no division of before or after. If there be before and after, it is but the discrimination of the mind. Discrimination gives rise to the flourishing of the postnatal and the tumult of thoughts and cares.\n\nThat which cannot be spoken, cannot be named—this is the ancestral *qi*, the very substance of the Dao. With substance established, function follows. Substance and function undivided—this is no mere careless generalization. Those who realize it know; those who do not remain outsiders.\n\n**Question:** What distinguishes the primordial from the postnatal?\n\n**Answer:** Where there is attachment, all is postnatal; where there is no attachment, there is the primordial. Where to seek the primordial? One must seek it within the postnatal. The postnatal’s emotions and perceptions are the primordial’s wondrous function. One must delve into the work of harmonizing and aligning. In harmonizing and aligning, there is stillness and emptiness—though not yet pure, for it remains wholly dross. Through long fusion, the dross is smelted away; purity arises of itself, unforced, and the golden elixir emerges from the furnace.\n\n**Question:** The *Dan Jing* says: “At dawn, *zhun*; at dusk, *meng*.”\n\n**Answer:** “Dawn *zhun*, dusk *meng*”—these are but metaphors. The fire-tending of advance and retreat is seen in an instant; why must one use the *zhun* hexagram at dawn and the *meng* hexagram at dusk? The profound mechanism eludes most, so my teaching cuts straight to the essence.\n\n**Question:** What of union, ascent, descent, and inversion?\n\n**Answer:** It is all one continuous matter. Grasp one phrase, and the whole body comes alive; head and feet reverse, shattering heaven and earth. A carefree Daoist, untroubled—yet possessing learning to order heaven and earth, power to overturn seas and move mountains. Ah, how vast! How could worldly dust ever burden the heart? It is only the human mind’s delusion, clinging to its own views—one unprecedented marvel after another.\n\n**Question:** Why can one not master the night?\n\n**Answer:** By day, the conscious spirit holds sway; by night, the conscious spirit retreats into dormancy. The seeds of evil deeds sown in one’s lifetime remain untransformed, so when conditions arise, they sprout. This is no path of sudden transcendence, no single stroke that severs all.\n\n**Question:** Must greed, anger, ignorance, and desire be eradicated to be true Daoist learning?\n\n**Answer:** So it seems—yet there is more to say. Greed, anger, ignorance, and desire are the functions of inherent nature, what we call *qing* (emotion). People lost in emotion do not know inherent nature—this is the state of the foolish. To know inherent nature yet not know emotion is to fall into dead emptiness. Thus, my teaching is lively and unbound, spanning heaven and earth, uniting past and present, equalizing self and other, free of enmity or favor. In bustling markets or deep mountains, galloping through pure realms—awakened golden immortals, flawless, are utterly joyous. From filth, the lotus blooms; in a snap of the fingers, one leaps beyond all learning. The thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara—is this mere trivial talk?\n\n**Question:** What of benefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle?\n\n**Answer:** Benefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle is good, yet beings are hard to exhaust, and exhausting principle exhausts beings. Grasp the fundamental, and it unifies the ten thousand differences—this suffices. Can you distinguish within non-distinction? Can you be without distinction within distinction? Do not cling to partial speech. Habitual tendencies must be removed, but understanding principle is paramount. When principle is understood, habitual tendencies fade of themselves—what need is there to strive to remove them? Striving to remove them fails to remove them and only wastes effort.\n\nBenefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle—speaking of the mind, in steadfast contemplation, one already benefits beings and exhausts principle. Steadfast contemplation is not one thing, and exhausting principle another. Begin with steadfast contemplation, and you will know the truth. With no selfishness, the heart is open and vast; spirit clear, *qi* bright—Buddhas and immortals. But for the slightest thought, the iron pillar roots run deep, and escape is difficult. Thus, one must observe and illuminate the mind, seeing it for oneself. Only then do the roots wither, and the thought of transcending the dust, the opportunity to enter the path, arise. Otherwise, one remains ignorant of one’s own inversion—how can one renew oneself, renew others, and unify all?\n\nRest for a moment, briefly observe the mind. After all have observed, I say: This very place is the monastery—where to seek *prajñā*?\n\n**Question:** What of external practices?\n\n**Answer:** Internal practice is observation; external practice is embracing unity. A *huatou* or a *gong’an*—cultivate both inner and outer, and there will come a time when spiritual moisture suffuses the body, the face glows, and the back brims with vitality. Simply observe me—no external practice, yet my body is naturally robust. This is your example.\n\n**Question:** Inherent nature is the same, but emotions differ.\n\n**Answer:** Emotions, too, are not different. It is only through habit, unexamined, that they have flowed and turned to this day, polluted and inextricably bound—this is not the fault of inherent nature. Inherent nature has no words—what is there to exhaust? Even words do not lie outside inherent nature.\n\nHave you not heard? Water may be clear or turbid, but its wetness is the same. Clear water is wet—is turbid water not also wet? Though clear and turbid differ, the nature of wetness does not. Contemplate this single point, and in time, sudden comprehension will dawn. Strive on.\n\nMoreover, emotion is inherent nature; inherent nature is emotion. Like an archer—bow and arrow are but tools; their function is a single living mechanism. How can it be grasped or imagined? The bow shoots the arrow, yet the living mechanism does not leave the bow. When the arrow leaves the bow, the arrow loses its living mechanism. This is the analogy of form and emptiness—do you all understand?\n\n**Question:** Is the primordial attained only after essence, *qi*, and spirit are set aside?\n\n**Answer:** Wrong. You know only the Dao of purity and non-action, not the natural principle of yin and yang. Yin and yang do not stand alone.\n\nWhat is heaven and earth without the ten thousand things? They would no longer be heaven. Heaven contains the ten thousand things—do the ten thousand things obscure even a thread of heaven? Observe the scene before your eyes: all things arrayed in profusion—have they ever hindered the clear and empty? It is precisely through the ten thousand things that the clear and empty is revealed. The true and real Dao is thus, thus.\n\n**Question:** How to engage in *chan* meditation?\n**Answer:** In *chan* meditation, one must arouse the *doubt-sensation*. With doubt comes awakening; without doubt, no awakening. The *doubt-sensation* is most difficult to arouse—only the ancient sages could do so. Many have attained great liberation from a single casual word or half-sentence after serving a good teacher for years. The Chan school is excellent, but one must engage in it skillfully. Those who do not engage skillfully fall into its pitfalls: looking down on all things, claiming equality with all buddhas, yet possessing not even half a speck. You must engage skillfully.\n\nYou believe that the highest vehicle of the Buddha’s practice is to ascend to the clouds in a single bound or traverse a thousand miles in worn-out sandals—this is the delusion of your mind, not the true path of the Buddha. The Buddha’s teachings begin from the highest point to guide people toward the ultimate, not to leave them stranded in vague, unfounded notions. His compassionate heart seeks to lead all beings. You think that initial practice can reach the shore in a day or night, without cultivation, nurturing, refinement, or polishing. I fear that the mediocre, even in old age, will fail to awaken on their own—such people are scorned by the sages.\n\n**Question:** How to achieve the utmost emptiness and profound stillness?\n**Answer:** Utmost emptiness and profound stillness cannot be attained in a single moment. To know stillness is not stillness; not to know stillness is also not stillness—it is merely muddy water. If you can empty yourself even a little, you will gain a little lightness and joy. This is the gradual method—how many possess the sudden capacity? It is only because of deep-seated habits and impurities that the name of cultivation arises. From now on, recognize the truth in the field of the heart. Illusion is not real—what, then, is real? Proceed from here, and one day, when you shatter the heavenly barrier, your feet and head will reverse, and only then will you find some path.\n\n**Question:** If illusion is not real, must it be completely eradicated?\n**Answer:** Though illusion is not eradicated, it can be put to use. All herbs are medicinal ingredients; when honey is mixed with them to form pills, they become *elixir of herbs*. Without herbs, medicine cannot be made; without medicine, illness cannot be cured—how can they be discarded? The petty man should be transformed, not eradicated; eradication invites disaster. The principle is the same.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean for feet and head to reverse?\n**Answer:** It means transformation—when you see ice melt and tiles dissolve. In Confucianism, \"joyful harmony with principle, like ice melting away\" is somewhat similar, though the strength of power, depth of practice, speed of realization, and sharpness of innate capacity differ. Chan says, \"Before the great matter is clarified, one is like one who has lost one’s parents\"—why, then, after the great matter is clarified, does one still resemble one who has lost one’s parents?\n\nIt is also said: The great Dao does not reside in stillness. Sitting still in a room only fans the flames of the heart’s fire. The work must be done in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—only then can one sit atop a thousand peaks without leaving the bustling crossroads. Do you all understand what I am saying?\n\n**Question:** My wisdom is insufficient to realize the Dao.\n**Answer:** What insufficiency is there? In terms of the original substance, there is no lack—it is naturally complete, neither increased nor diminished. In terms of the stages of practice, there is insufficiency. What is insufficient? Morning defilement and evening contamination turn clear water into muddy sludge; it cannot be settled, and stirring only makes it murkier—this is the origin of the discourse on cultivation. To cultivate is to cultivate conduct; when conduct is cultivated, nature is also cultivated.\n\n**Question:** Must one attain the *Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom* to realize the Dao?\n**Answer:** That is but an empty name. Boundlessness is \"great,\" wisdom penetrating all is \"perfect,\" radiant illumination is \"mirror,\" and selflessness is \"wisdom.\" It is not a literal mirror of true suchness but merely the meaning of a mirror. Do not cling to it.\n\n**Question:** What is the difference between *discernment* and *wisdom*?\n**Answer:** Discernment is wisdom. In ordinary beings, it is called *discernment*; in immortals and buddhas, it is called *wisdom*—only the distinction between purity and impurity remains.\n\n**Question:** When the three temporal states are cut off, is the *post-heaven* exhausted?\n**Answer:** Not so. Though the three temporal states are cut off, the *post-heaven* is not exhausted. Proceeding along the middle way, there are countless transformations and generations, refining the dregs. If all were completely purified, there could be no transformations or generations—it is difficult to uproot the fundamental consciousness entirely. This is my esoteric transmission, unknown even to the gods, let alone shallow-learning ordinary beings! Outside the five phases, where can the true teaching be found? The dragon’s path is not the rabbit’s trail; shallow grass does not run deep.\n\n**Question:** What is *vital impulse*?\n**Answer:** When *vital impulse* overflows, it is great liveliness. Without liveliness, it is insufficient to aid the Dao.\n\n**Question:** What is *the knife’s edge*?\n**Answer:** The *knife’s edge* pertains to subtle channels—drink the *soul-returning nectar* first.\n\n**Question:** Is illusion not real?\n**Answer:** Do you know illusion? To know illusion is to depart from it. The wondrous enlightenment of true emptiness is never deluded—it is only time that shatters it. Illusory appearances, being without form, reveal the constant flow of reality. The constant flow of reality is not the universal protection of the discerning mind. When one method is relinquished, all methods become manifest. Step upon the plum blossoms atop the head—*tap, tap, tap*—there is another immortal supported on the palm. Tattered robes and begging for food are not for selling magic talismans. *Spit, spit, spit*—non-action and purity are the master.\n\n**Question:** What is *leisurely nurturing*?\n**Answer:** *Leisurely nurturing* is transformation. Small things have small transformations; great things have great transformations. Transformation is spirit—only through transformation can one speak of spirit.\n\n**Question:** What is the distinction between the prior and posterior Heaven?\n\n**Answer:** The posterior Heaven does not depart from the prior Heaven; the prior Heaven is itself the posterior Heaven—both are the same Heaven. Clouds obscure it, and worldly people see only the clouds and not the Heaven. I see the clouds as Heaven, so clouds are no obstruction.\n\n**Question:** What of cultivation through illusion-like practice?\n\n**Answer:** Cultivation through illusion-like practice cannot be attained lightly. Effect is itself merit—do you understand?\n\n**Question:** What is the true seed?\n\n**Answer:** When the mind is empty, without speaking of the true seed, that is the true seed. The Tathāgatagarbha encompasses boundless arising.\n\n**Question:** What does the \"bottom of the sea\" signify?\n\n**Answer:** The \"bottom of the sea\" is the profound depths of the human mind. When the sea dries up, its bottom is revealed; when a person dies, the mind remains unknown. Only through profound inquiry into the subtlest can this be grasped.\n\n**Further question:** What of the mind’s profound depths?\n\n**Answer:** A profound mind travels far. Only when one travels far does one find a dwelling within creation, and only with such a dwelling can one transform creation. Only then can one silently turn the mind of Heaven. The shallow cannot attain realization, so they mistake superficialities for the ultimate.\n\n*Far-traveling, the honored remains unmoved;*\n*Yet subtle principles are hard to unfold.*\n*Everywhere birdsong is heard—*\n*Walking deep among the mountain flowers.*\n\n**Question:** In the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha questions the mind in seven places—how do we know which is the true mind?\n\n**Answer:** It is precisely this not-knowing. It is knowing without knowing, not unknowing without knowing.\n\n**Further question:** What is the ever-abiding true mind?\n\n**Answer:** When none of the vijñānas recognize it, that is the ever-abiding. Within non-recognition, recognition arises—that is wisdom. If discriminating thoughts arise and the mind scatters, one falls into the cycle of rebirth and becomes ordinary.\n\n**Question:** Where is the mind’s fixed abode?\n\n**Answer:** The mind has no fixed abode. If the mind had a fixed place to point to, it would be a deluded mind. Depart from delusion, and it is real.\n\nDo you now see me?\n\n**Further question:** If the mind cannot attain purity, what is to be done?\n\n**Answer:** How could the mind attain purity? Seek purity precisely within this impure state. When purity gives rise to impure appearances, that is when true purity attains purity.\n\n**Question:** What is the mind?\n\n**Answer:** What is not the mind? No-mind is the mind. With mind, there is no perfect penetration; without mind, one falls into vagueness. It is neither without mind nor with mind—between existence and non-existence, no-mind is the mind.\n\n**Further question:** What is the true mind?\n\n**Answer:** The true mind has no form; if it had form, it would belong to illusion and delusion. Yet the true mind is also not formless—it is not bound by form yet truly embodies all forms. Form, color, and inherent nature are the same for sages and worthies in their learning.\n\n**Further question:** Should the true mind be sought from the source of the mind?\n\n**Answer:** If the source is pure, heavenly principle manifests before you, and daily conduct does not obstruct the supreme Dao. If the source is impure, even if one has some insight, it is like a flickering lamp in the wind—how can that be the true constant?\n\nDo not mistake the true mind for a deluded mind. The so-called true mind is a mind of radiant purity, thus it can penetrate Heaven and Earth without the slightest falsity. It is not a mixture of copper and lead, nor is glimpsing the moon through clouds considered mastery. From where does this seeing-essence arise? Seek it, and you will not find it.\n\n*The Dao lies before your eyes, yet people do not recognize it—*\n*Vainly wielding the hoe, they scrutinize with care.*\n\n**Question:** What is true emptiness and wondrous existence?\n\n**Answer:** When the mind is empty yet not empty, that is true emptiness. When the mind exists yet does not exist, that is wondrous existence. Do not cling to one side—only then can you enter the Middle Way and lay the foundation for virtue.\n\n**Question:** My insight is shallow; I seek guidance to enter the mind’s profound depths.\n\n**Answer:** It is not shallow. At the gateway of the mind-ground, depth and shallowness are not uniform. The same words may appear deep to the profound, shallow to the shallow, and perfectly attuned to those with perfect insight—thus there is no fixed standard.\n\nYet the shallow striving for depth is what learners should diligently pursue. The profound is not separate from the present; it is only because perceptions differ that depth and shallowness are spoken of. One net can catch all—when you see your original nature in the present moment, where are the layers of depth and shallowness to be found, or the distinctions of high and low, thick and thin?\n\nThose who do not awaken find this hard to express. If you take my words as confirmation, you become one of overweening pride, tumbling headlong to the Western Paradise.\n\nHow can one achieve \"not clinging even to a single thread\"?\nIt is originally without a single thread to cling to.\nTo be without a single thread is the utmost refinement;\nrefined to the extreme, luminous and firm—this is already the fruition ground, not to be taken lightly.\n\nAgain, it is said: when dross is worn away and perceptions merge with neighbors, only the pure essence remains.\nThe realm of bodhi is purity at its utmost, luminous and firm, flames soaring to the sky, illuminating boundless worlds—\nhow could this be attained?\n\nQuestion: The emptiness of the person.\nAnswer: The fixed-nature śrāvaka is not Chan, yet it is the first day of Chan.\nOnly when essence congeals and light shines white\ndo you know who the drifting and careless are.\nHaving attained the person, one mounts the vehicle;\nwithout attaining the person, do not speak of transforming vehicles—\nwhat is this talk of \"emptiness of the person\" or \"the person as emptiness\"?\n\nQuestion: Is it ultimately a single \"nothingness\"?\nAnswer: It cannot be spoken of as \"being\" or \"non-being.\"\nFrom shallow to deep, there is a sequence to practice;\nthe principle is not two, yet the layers of effort differ.\nThere is a \"nothingness\" that has arrived home, and one that has not—\ndiscern this well.\n\nQuestion: Is the golden hue the same?\nAnswer: When the golden hue is full, it is the same.\nYet the measure originally differs:\nsmall returns to the minor spirit, great to the major spirit—each according to its cause and fruition.\nSome depart halfway, entering the divine or immortal paths,\neach following the depth of their effort—nothing is fixed.\n\nQuestion: What does the Golden Elder signify?\nAnswer: The Golden Elder is the self-nature of the consciousness liberating itself;\nself-liberation is the transformation of consciousness—this is the Golden Elder.\n\nAgain asked: Is gold the true essence?\nAnswer: It is called pure and unadulterated—\nnot the gold of this world.\nGain one part of emptiness, and you possess one part;\nwhen full, it blossoms, and gold emerges from the furnace.\nYet it must still be tempered—\nthe more it is refined, the purer it becomes;\nthe purer, the more luminous.\nIn time, consciousness is transformed into Buddha-wisdom,\nfragrant seas and compassionate clouds—\nAmitābha Buddha.\n\nQuestion: The Three Passes.\nAnswer: The Three Passes are one pass,\nwithout sequence or hierarchy to divide them.\nIf you make distinctions, then there is a fixed place—\nthis is not the Eternal Quiet Light.\nThe Eternal Quiet Light is like a compass,\nunmoving amid east, west, south, and north—\nyet the Dipper’s handle spans the clouds.\nThe drum beats deep into the night, *dong dong*;\nwhere lightning flashes, one cannot choose—\nstartled, the dreaming soul awakens.\n\nAgain asked: What is the Upper Palace?\nAnswer: The Upper Palace is no-palace as palace.\nThough the Three Passes cannot be divided by sequence,\nthe verification of effort still has distinctions of three passes.\nBreak through the ranks of superior merit—\nrank is noble, title exalted.\nHeavenly flowers rain down,\nyet in the end, all is empty emptiness.\nEmpty emptiness, inexhaustible in use—\nwithin nature, life is attained as true merit,\nhow could this be mere human effort?\nProceeding deeply in prajñā, one sees wondrous ascent;\nwondrous ascent or not—\nit is but tiger and dragon.\nWithin a realm, there is another realm—\nwhat need for thoroughfare?\nWithout a shred of effort,\nit is yet the same as nature’s brocade.\nHaving resolved this life,\nturn it upside down and inside out for all to share.\nYang-qi lies hidden, about to emerge from the valley—\na single thunderclap is heard in the stillness,\nand in the flash of lightning, seek the true seed.\nMerit upon merit is the great pattern.\n\nAgain, it is said: The *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand words,\nthe *Yin Fu Jing*’s three hundred characters—\nnot a single phrase is spoken on the surface!\nLater generations, deluded by false transmissions,\nhave lost their original true nature,\nfailing to seek their own life’s root and destiny—\nleading to those who burn thatch and play with fire,\nor those who move qi and shift essence.\nEven regulating or counting the breath\nis but a later contrivance to gather the mind.\n\nQuestion: After long accumulation, does the golden light manifest externally?\nAnswer: Only when the Mysterious Pass is established does inner and outer become apparent.\nWithout the Mysterious Pass, it is like boiling an empty pot with fire and water—\nnothing takes hold.\nWhen the Mysterious Pass is penetrated, the Heavenly Heart appears—\nnot the ghostly visage of a black cave.\n\nQuestion: The sutra says, \"In the gēng direction, the moon appears\"—\nis this a metaphor for its light being faint, not yet fully revealed?\nAnswer: Yes.\n\nQuestion: That which is luminous and numinous in the mind—\nDaoists use it as the golden needle, the master core...\n\nThe Buddhists, regarding it as the root of samsara, call it pure karma.\nAnswer: Observe.\n\nQuestion: What is samādhi?\nAnswer: When the mind holds no fixed view, essence congeals into samādhi.\nNo need to clutch the compass—\nlet me turn it east or west as I will;\nillusions of worldly affairs taste no different,\nstill the same flower from years past.\n\nFlower, flower, flower,\nfruit ripens in the house of flowers;\nfruit unseen within the flower,\nthis is the boast of fruition’s rank;\nwhen cause and effect interpenetrate,\nthis is the immortal’s home.\nBuddha and Dao are not two,\nonly worldly views differ;\nreturn to my pure virtue,\nluminous and flowerless.\n\nQuestion: The whole body is hands and eyes.\nAnswer: Hands and eyes are living phrases—do not ponder dead phrases;\ndead phrases lack life, and life is no phrase.\n\nQuestion: Must the light be extinguished?\nAnswer: Light cannot be extinguished.\nThe sun and moon shine universally—\nhow could they be grasped even slightly?\nThe Daoist casts off mind and nature together,\nworldly affairs are but inversion;\nhalf-empty, half-full, wondrous in emptiness,\nhalf-having, half-lacking, naturally free.\nHalf wordless, half speaking,\nseek the great function within.\n\nUnderstanding, understanding, understanding—\na foot of earth births,\nhalf the sky dawns.\nThe numinous mechanism is hard to grasp,\neven spirits cannot fathom its origin—\nhow much less man?\n\nQuestion: What is the meaning of discerning signs in silent sitting?\nAnswer: Like a jade casket opening a new mirror,\nrevealing a trace of pure light.\nOnce delusion is shattered,\nno matter how eloquent your words,\nI remain single-mindedly consistent.\n\nQuestion: Turning the light inward to reflect is the raft across the sea of birth and death;\nrefining the form with jade nectar is the subtle metaphor of using water to control fire.\nAs for the mind’s awareness, its essence is one, yet its functions are two:\nthere is the awareness of dullness, and the awareness of spontaneity.\nThe awareness of dullness is like a lightning flash—\nlike the seeing of eyes and hearing of ears;\nthe awareness of spontaneity is like sound entering the ear on its own,\nobjects meeting the eye on their own,\nnon-doing yet nothing undone,\nnon-abiding yet nowhere absent.\nWhen a thought arises, the spirit’s eye is luminous.\nThe *Yijing* says: “To know the incipient is divine”—\nits origin unknown.\nConstant responsiveness, constant stillness—\nis this not the “wuwei true person” of the highest vehicle?\nAnswer: Your analogy is apt, but the mind-seal is still needed.\n\nQuestion: The governing of qi is the eye.\nThe eye is the yang aperture; the Dao lies before the eyes.\nThough it sees and hears, it transcends movement and stillness—\nthis is the mind’s ordinary state.\nWithout dissolving consciousness, the eye cannot be clear;\nwithout a clear eye, consciousness cannot be dissolved.\nIs this so?\nAnswer: You have penetrated one barrier—\nbreak through one, and another appears.\nBarriers are pared away in order;\nnon-attachment and non-stagnation are prized,\nsilence and softness are strength.\nLying down, listening to the bell’s sound,\nwalking the Buddha’s path.\n\nQuestion: Is the eye the true mind?\nAnswer: No, it is illusory light,\nused to expel yin evil and govern qi.\nIf you take it as the wondrous aperture,\nif you take it as the supreme treasure,\nyour knowledge is shallow, not deep.\n\nQuestion: You have taught:\n“Vast and unbounded, free and untrammeled,\na chest of fervent blood—\nthe earth is no longer foul;\na lotus burned by wildfire,\na coin revealed in full;\neach step is primordial,\nuntainted by later conditions.”\nI humbly ponder:\n“The mountains and rivers of the great earth are my dharmakāya,\nthe five turbid evil worlds are all pure Dao-grounds,\ncompassionate yet wise,\nqi flows unimpeded,\nfunctioning naturally,\nembodying meaning to manifest form,\nrevealing in full the primordial original nature,\nthe wisdom-life imperishable through kalpas,\nlike scattered gold coins.”\n\nAnswer: Verification is needed to know.\n\nHere the resonance falls deep, deeper still—ultimately boundless.\nThe ancient Dao stretches vast, few tread its path;\nyet when words and phrases align, spring blooms across the earth.\nThe saṃsāric world is wholly embraced—\nwhy speak of dusk and doors quietly shut?\n\nQuestion: The gateway of ear-root sound-perception.\nAnswer: The ear-root’s purity is the bodhisattva’s perfect penetration.\nFrom this you enter verification, attaining the cultivation of hearing the permeation of hearing,\nthen knowing the samādhi of illusion as none other than the Vairocana nature-ocean.\nThe primordial face of Qian does not lie beyond this.\nThe six roots purified, the one essence truly wondrous—\nyou must turn toward the quiescence of true suchness.\nIts essence is quiescence, its function is illumination;\nonly when quiescence and illumination unite is it called “one.”\nYou must know that quiescence and illumination fuse as two-in-one—\nwithout great samādhi, this cannot be.\nQuiescent yet illuminating, illuminating yet quiescent;\nquiescence and illumination are fundamentally empty—\nemptiness itself is quiescence and illumination.\nQuiescent, quiescent, quiescent, quiescent—\nonly when you return to non-quiescence is it true quiescence.\nTrue quiescence is not quiescent;\nquiescence without anything to quiesce is true quiescence.\nWhat care for illumination or quiescence?\nQuiescence quiescently illuminates quiescence.\n\nChan principle demands deep ascent;\nprofound principle leaves no trace.\nThe Way lies before your eyes,\nyet what lies before your eyes is hard to fathom.\nPeople favor the strange and crave the new,\nmissing what lies before them—\nthey know not where the Way may be.\nThe Way is precisely this present moment;\nto obscure this present moment is to let the mind wander and intent scatter.\nThought after thought escapes your grasp,\nall because spiritual power is shallow;\nspiritual power is shallow because the mind wanders.\nThe sun and moon’s concealment and revelation—\nthis is the supreme Way.\nFaint, the root of heaven;\ndim, the origin of the primordial.\nSubtle, the peril of the Way;\nluminous, the radiance of spirit.\nAdvancing day by day, month by month,\nyou uncover the true message.\nThe true message lies in the level plain—\nnot hidden in stillness, yet requiring stillness to hold it.\nQuestion: Subtle principle is hard to fathom.\nAnswer: What is hard to fathom?\n\nThe true visage is hard to behold.\n\nFurther question: How to turn the key?\nAnswer: A single phrase turns the key—only by grinding it at the root;\ngrind until it severs, both ends empty,\nand within emptiness you see the Ancestor and the School,\nclearly attesting to perfect penetration.\nThe adornment of ten thousand practices\nis precisely the wondrous function of bodhi;\nthe radiance of a single spirit\nis but the impermanence of the immortal’s Way.\nBreaking free from the cage to transcend the world,\nthe eastern moon of treasure illumines mountains and rivers.\n\nJust now I passed Mount Hua—\nnot a single mendicant knew me.\nThe power of the Buddha is originally boundless,\nyet Dao and Buddha tread different paths.\n\nAlas!\nGhosts and spirits perceive with clarity,\nyet cannot fathom where my mind remains unmoved.\nFrom now on, I know the One,\nyet know not the Two.\nOnly through unknowing does one know all;\nknowing all, one is yet unknowing.\nIlluminating this understanding,\nattainment is not difficult.\n\nIn time, rare fragrances and wondrous blossoms\nperfume and purify wherever they touch.\nAh! To attain great freedom.\n\nGrateful for the master’s guidance,\nI have come to such fruition.\nAncestral spirits gather,\nfulfilling filial piety and turning the heart of heaven.\nReflecting on worldly affairs,\nthey are but dreams within dreams.\nMoved by compassion for sentient beings,\nI arouse the mind of great sorrow.\nAll beings dwell within the great awakening,\nyet remain oblivious and unaware.\nThus, I do not slight sentient beings,\nfor they differ from sages only in a single thought’s turn.\n\nQuestion: What is the primordial?\nAnswer: The mind is the primordial.\nThe primordial is spoken of in contrast to the postnatal—\na matter of duality.\nOnly when the mind transcends duality\ndoes it become truly constant,\nunobstructed in manifesting all forms,\nas the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* has already made clear.\n\nFurther question: When the mind transcends duality, is this not the meaning of \"wuji\" (the Ultimate)?\nAnswer: Wuji is true emptiness;\nyouji is wondrous principle.\nWuji is youji—\nthere is no wuji beyond youji.\n\"Encompassing heaven and earth without excess,\nshaping the myriad things without omission,\"\npivoting yin and yang,\neach form returning to its root—\nsuch wondrous subtlety is simply unseen.\nThis speaks of what precedes heaven and earth,\nbefore the primordial chaos had divided.\nYet it is also the matter after chaos.\nWithout distinction of before or after, yet distinctions exist—\nnot something to grasp through mere recitation.\nDiscern the upside-down function within,\nand the mind, like yellow earth, transforms into gold.\n\nThus, to speak of the primordial\nis to say the primordial is beyond words.\nYet there is also a primordial spoken in words—\nwhat is the primordial spoken in words?\nThe division between sage and ordinary.\nThe sage is the primordial;\nthe ordinary is the postnatal.\nHere, both primordial and postnatal\nare called postnatal—\nthey cannot be called primordial.\nWhat, then, is the primordial?\nFormlessness.\nYet formlessness does not stand alone—\nit is attested to by the formed.\nThe formed is the function of the formless;\nthe formless is the essence of the formed.\nThus, the formed is also the formless—\nthis is the wondrous union of movement and stillness,\nthe true emptiness of wondrous existence.\n\nExpounding the true teaching,\nheavenly flowers fall in profusion—\nrare and marvelous, a precious encounter,\nyet it is the ancient Buddha’s Chan mechanism.\n\nQuestion: What method should one rely on in cultivation?\nAnswer: Rely on nothing.\nWithout dependence, see the true mind.\nThe true mind is not without dependence—\nit is walking atop Vairocana’s crown.\nOld Chan monks, accomplished monks,\nare indeed rare.\nIt all lies in one mind,\nwith no remaining dharma or unfulfilled meaning.\n\nQuestion: What is spiritual power?\nAnswer: Wondrously responding to the myriad things is called \"spirit\";\nbeing nowhere yet nowhere absent is called \"power.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the reward body?\nAnswer: The reward body has no reward—\nit is merely a provisional name,\nmeaning perfection.\nIf there were truly a reward body,\nit would be dualistic seeing.\nTwo yet not one—\none would also not be one.\nThis is the true One, the non-dual illumination of quiescence.\n\nFurther question: What is the dharma body?\nAnswer: The dharma body\nis the principle that gathers and accumulates all dharmas,\nyet cannot be grasped in words.\n\nQuestion: Does the mind have a name?\nAnswer: The mind has no name—\neven the Dao is but a provisional name.\nThe great Dao transcends images, numbers, and names—\nhow could it be named?\n\nQuestion: What is birth and death?\nAnswer: Distinguishing between provisional and transformed birth and death\nstill leaves birth and death.\nIf one does not distinguish between provisional and transformed,\nthe cycle of rebirth is brief and empty.\nNo one asks about emptiness—\nI speak of my own traces:\na drifting leaf in the wind,\nan immortal’s departure leaving no trace.\n\nFurther question: What is non-birth?\nAnswer: Birth without birth—\nthis is called non-birth.\nNon-birth has another tune—\nsing me a song of non-birth,\nand the world will hear the true non-birth.\n\nQuestion: What is karmic response?\nAnswer: Some attain the essence of the great yin,\nsome attain the essence of the great yang—\nin truth, it is still one,\nonly differing in individuals’ capacities.\nThe great and venerable Dao of the Most High\nlies nowhere beyond daily conduct—\nhow could it be a ghost’s den!\nThere are those who mistake the physical body for the dharma body,\nseeking ascension through qi and destiny,\ntaking this as the foundation for forming the embryo and giving birth to the infant.\nSelf-satisfied and complacent,\nthey do not know that the great Dao is like sifting gold from sand—\nthe golden crow flying into the toad’s cave\nare all matters before birth.\nThose with shallow vision—\nhow could they glimpse its inner sanctum?\nClinging to existence, they grasp existence;\nclinging to emptiness, they stagnate in emptiness—\nthey do not recognize the source of the great Dao.\nFirst explore the source,\nclearly seeing your own self before the empty kalpa—\nonly then will you understand the principle of the divine dragon’s transformations,\nthe harmony of husband and wife’s song,\nwithout clinging to existence\nor clinging to emptiness.\nWondrous existence and true emptiness,\ntrue emptiness and wondrous existence\nmanifest at the tip of a hair.\nSmall and large interpenetrate,\none and many are unobstructed—\nonly then can one speak of the affairs within the cauldron,\nthe clarity of transcending and undergoing birth at a glance.\nThis is not mere talk.\n\nLet each follow their calling,\nabiding in their station and acting therein—\nwith a heart open, bright, and unburdened,\nbecoming in this world a towering man,\na paragon of filial piety and pure loyalty,\nso as not to have lived in vain,\nleaving a name that endures through the ages.\n\nA heart at ease is immortality,\na heart unshackled is Buddhahood,\na heart selfless is sagehood.\nPreserve your innate knowing and ability—\neach possesses it within,\nnot to be sought without,\nnor weighed in the flesh.\nWhen the body decays after death,\nyellow earth is enough to bury you;\nwise and foolish alike return to the same,\nrich and poor meet the same end—\nwhat of all that was ever truly yours?\nOnly this single spark of luminous awareness.\n\nAutumn skies, the moon’s radiance,\na precious mirror’s limpid glow—\nlotuses thrive in roaring flames,\nthe Western Path is golden immortality.\nNo need to vainly seek or banish deluded thoughts;\nfragrant flowers and ripe fruit flourish as one.\n\nI ask for seven days—\nseal the pass and devote yourself to Daoist practice.\nOne replied:\nI hasten without rest,\ntraversing the four seas,\nexhorting goodness and transforming evil,\ndissolving the dark miasma that billows upward,\ndrawing forth the radiant qi of virtue.\nThus my teaching is like the ocean’s waters,\neach vessel filled according to its measure.\nTo take seven days is a night of great occasion—\nhow often in life does one encounter such an opportunity?\nWhat is it that I strive for?\nIs it not the greatest of vows!\n\nBeginning on a certain day will suffice.\n\nOne asked, “How does one undertake the seven-day practice?”\n\nThe reply: “In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, rouse this mind and keep it ever unwavering. There is no moment’s gap in the work—let it be unbroken. Nor must you rigidly confine inquiry to sitting; when not sitting, do not cease inquiry. Yet sitting must follow the precepts, as is only proper. Sit for three quarters of an hour, walk for one; take meals at regular times, and guard against cold and heat. When matters arise, attend to them as usual—precisely in attending to them lies the place of practice. Above all, with every thought, ask whence it comes and whither it goes. Shatter this den of thieves, and you may stride straight upward to the Jasper Heaven. All other practices of the flesh are unnecessary. In this Dao, the work of the flesh is already encompassed: master one, and all are mastered; mountains, rivers, and the great earth are none other than this body. What use is there in fussing over the filth of a mere heart, liver, or five viscera?\n\nToday I, too, resolve to enlighten. If only your karmic conditions and capacities can bear it, you shall personally witness and verify—sweeping aside all heterodox and misguided paths. What is the Great Dao? What are nature and life? Why speak of such things at all?\n\nAs for the four modes of deportment, follow the precepts and maintain practice—there are countless topics for inquiry. Let me offer one instance of causation: How is it that the ox eats grass, and the grass eats the ox? This is the nonduality of being and nonbeing. How does one distinguish movement and stillness? How does one relinquish both form and emptiness, and after relinquishing, is there still form and emptiness? Investigate.”\n\n“Pure karma differs from defiled karma—when spoken of, both ordinary and sage are cast aside. In the vast, empty radiance of the Great Light Heaven, living immortals manifest.”\n\n“Man’s birth begins with qi embraced in the turbid mire, forming his substance. By the time he awakens, yin and yang have already parted. Cravings and worldly splendor, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all swirl about, yet he remains oblivious. Once yin and yang decisively separate, the primordial qi cannot be restored, and death alone follows. This qi is the qi of Heaven and Earth, not something you or I may claim as our own; within it lies principle. The good are rewarded with good, the evil with evil. Those who fall into evil and drift toward alien forms—where their po souls return, where their hun souls scatter, the shallowness of their resonance, the worth of their encounters—all differ in kind. Yet the great pattern remains: millet does not grow from sorghum, the phoenix does not nurse a foal. Each follows its own course; it all depends on where a person directs his steps.”\n\n“Are the natures of men—whether dull or wise—innately different in what they are endowed with? The unworthy fall short, while the wise exceed—yet herein lies the clarity of the Middle Way. The worthy stand far apart from the foolish, yet unbeknownst to them, before the worthy ascend, they are in truth no better than the foolish. Let each reflect on this for himself.”\n\n“Since I first established this teaching, my approach has varied, high and low, never uniform. I observe only whether a person is sincere and faithful, for their karmic resonance differs, and their aspirations are not the same. My coming here is no small matter—hurriedly I have traversed the four seas and nine provinces, precisely to offer today a ladder and a boat. Know that my Way is upright, radiant, and great, not the lurking of demons and specters. I refute heterodox teachings, rectify human hearts, and unite all in harmonious, virtuous qi. I do not confine people like birds in a cage, nor do I promote misguided paths, withered meditation, ascetic austerities, or the neglect of proper duties to feign superiority. The Great Dao is majestic, the sun and moon ever in motion—all are the supreme Way, now made manifest. Even if adorned with jeweled ornaments, embellishing the world, it is not extravagance when the time calls for it. Even with but a single incense burner and a few disciples, sincere and reverent, it is not frugality—abundance or restraint must suit the moment, harmonized to the mean. You must broaden your vision and not cling to the present. Noble men, vast as a thousand-zhang canopy, must shine forth.”\n\n“An ancient buddha reveals the compassionate ferry, saving the busy world of heaven and earth. All phenomena observed without duality—with every thought, the mind speaks of blossoms and gold. In the still night, the hammer’s sound echoes from an ancient temple; wind, flowers, snow, and moon—all rise as incense in one burner.”\n\n“My Dao is vast and profound, not like those with the vision of a valley, who see only the eye’s end as immortality, cut themselves off from others, and flee the world to dwell in mountain caves, believing themselves content. Idle hands at leisure, savoring the rewards of heaven and earth—wind, flowers, snow, and moon—discoursing on mysteries, wandering the islands of Penglai, never lacking immortals. My Way is not like this. I act on Heaven’s behalf to transform, universally delivering the worthy and the foolish alike to the sacred fruit of supreme goodness—this is no narrow stream or minor path. Therefore, you must redouble your reverence and caution, riding this heavenly grace to gain true benefit. Though the depth of benefit may vary, each receives according to their capacity and karma, all perfectly complete.”\n\n“This humble one fully embodies the pulse of the Dao, here to manifest its luminous efficacy, that later generations and those who uphold the teaching may know: my Way is one of assisting in the transformation and nurturing of all things, not self-liberation alone. Those of the heterodox paths who now follow my teaching must each vow and set their minds to it. Perfecting oneself and perfecting others—perfecting others is precisely how one perfects oneself; one cannot perfect oneself without perfecting others.”\n\n“All of you, quiet your minds and heed my words: the nine bends of the Yellow River, the perilous passes of heaven—all are but manifestations of the human heart. The great earth itself is fundamentally impartial, level and vast. Cross the rivers and weirs with ease, for this humble one’s transformative traces are manifest across the nine provinces. I grasp the peaks of heaven and earth, the sun and moon; the green-tipped sword hangs at my shoulder. I have searched the world for good and evil—how many sons and grandsons shift responsibility, while aged parents feel themselves a burden? Brothers and kin harbor resentment, each preserving a facade, unaware of their original purity. They entangle themselves in chaos, never knowing: if your fate is to be pure, you are born pure. If your fate is not to be pure, forcibly pruning branches and leaves only leads to rebirth, leaving behind many karmic debts, adding yet another case to settle—still the karmic conditions remain unresolved, and afflictions multiply.”\n\n“All are but flesh-eyed mortals, seeking only immediate gratification, heedless of Heaven’s principle, clear and inescapable. How many descendants flourish without first cultivating filial piety and brotherly harmony? My descent into the mortal realm has been long, yet all I do is urge people to accept their fate. Accept your fate, and when your fate is fulfilled, even the impure will attain purity—a gentle, harmonious breeze. Invisibly, spirits and auspicious deities protect and surround you, and over time, the untransformed becomes qi—yet none know why. Fortune flows from every side, disasters vanish, blessings increase. Otherwise, what seems a clever scheme in the moment only darkens the atmosphere, making qi difficult to transform—yet none know why. Day by day, obstacles arise, spirit wanes, and ghosts seize their po souls. Their wisdom falls short of others’, every step misdirected, unaware of their own transgressions, accumulating by degrees. They blame Heaven for lacking principle, others for lacking compassion! Such foolish and wicked souls are truly pitiable, yet deserving of scorn.”\n\n“Thus I descend to the world to universally save sentient beings, guiding them toward good fruits. The good are rewarded with good, the evil with evil—Heaven’s gaze is luminous, not a thread amiss. Great good brings great fruit; small good brings small fruit. Each reaps their own fruit—none know why it is so, yet so it is. Heed these words with reverence!”\n\n“To ever keep this before one’s eyes, to brightly manifest lofty virtue—sage and worthy learning differs not from profound Chan. Yet世人 fail to discern the distinctions and commonalities of the Three Teachings, endlessly debating, truly raving in drunken dreams, galloping past flowers to laughter’s end! Those who turn their minds to this Dao, however, fall prey to the flaw of loving stillness and hating movement, each and all unaware of how they forcibly sever karmic entanglements, still not resolving their conditions. Some cut themselves off from others and flee the world, plunging deep into mountain forests—yet there, tigers and leopards, wolves and jackals, mountain spirits and demons, violent thunder and fierce winds make the heart tremble and the spirit quake! Moreover, with bodies of flesh and blood, clothing and food must be supplied, ever dependent on others; the slightest misstep in adjustment brings cold and heat, damp and rain, swiftly turning to suffering, illness, and pain. At such times, failing to awaken, they stray onto side paths, obscuring the learning of the Dao, gaining nothing, only harming themselves. Others, aspiring to mountain forests, unwilling to engage with worldly affairs in action or concealment, blindly pursue eccentric and bizarre conduct to set themselves apart from the vulgar, unaware that they waste time and neglect duties, leading to deficiencies in affairs, daily decline of spirit, and no insight into the Dao. Unaware of their own missteps, they stray onto side paths, then claim that doing good brings no prosperity, that the Dao cannot be learned—such wild talk truly merits great laughter! Added to this, heterodox teachers and misleading friends disorder the ancestral lineage of the Dao, deviating by a hair’s breadth a thousand miles, fishing for fame and praise, truly harming our Dao.\n\nAlas! Today, two or three of you rouse your aspirations upward, delving into subtleties and penetrating mysteries, becoming treasures of my gate. Yet the flaws in learning the Dao, leading to the decline of human affairs, all stem from entering side gates. In the end, the deep intentions that arise in the heart are deeply pitiable. If one could cultivate within human affairs, it would surpass mountain forests. The transmission of my Dao has always been cultivation within human affairs, not favoring deep mountains or ghostly caves, fleeing the world and cutting off from others to become self-liberated hermits.”\n\n“That I attain the same enduring vastness as Heaven and Earth is because I embody Heaven and Earth’s heart of cherishing life. If you all can vow to act according to your strength and talents, without harm to yourselves and with benefit to others—though benefiting others cannot but entail some harm to oneself—yet there is no principle of complete harm. If completely harmed, what others gain they cannot bear to receive. Unless it is a matter of great righteousness or repayment of past karmic debts, it is unnecessary. Simply strive to act in accord with the times, ensuring appropriateness and avoiding fault, transforming misfortune into fortune—this is a lucky star, this is a great disciple who spreads transformation in my gate. In the unseen future, you will receive retribution, grasping the handle of human fortune and misfortune, second only to me. My intent is not reckless bestowal; you must skillfully comprehend that even a single word or deed benefiting others is an aspect of spreading transformation.”\n\n“For people, idle moments fill most days, while busy times are few. Like you all here, focused on this one matter—once past it, ten thousand threads and a thousand ends arise. Yet in truth, walking, standing, sitting, lying—all are one matter; people merely make themselves busy. Thus I previously said: simply not being deluded in the present moment keeps the mind from scattering and the intent from straying. Saving much effort, treading firmly on the ground, adapting to circumstances, neither indulging in idle thoughts nor ‘learning the Dao’—this itself is the great Dao. With long practice, spirit congeals and qi gathers, merging seamlessly; the power of spirit flows continuously, only then dissolving demonic obstacles, escaping the cage, ascending the sky, step by step reverently.”\n\n“Human sentiments wax and wane, worldly affairs shift and change, quite difficult to foresee—none are fixed.”\n\nWhen flowers bloom, people admire them; when they fall, they become a tangled mess, impossible to gather. Only when swept clean does the moment become truly fine and shared in beauty. Since you have all returned to my teaching, do not crave power and influence—when the tree falls, the vines wither, leaving only a pile of rotten firewood. You must recognize worldly attachments and sever them completely; why chatter on, planting them in the field of the mind without release?\n\nThose who study the Dao must demonstrate their skill precisely within the snares of entanglement—otherwise, what makes them extraordinary? They would be but common folk. Who cannot pass through favorable circumstances? Yet when adversity strikes, even a slight murmur of resentment toward heaven or blame of others cannot be avoided. Little do they realize: what past virtues have they accumulated to deserve the blessings of heaven and earth’s nurturance? Have they ever truly reflected?\n\nFrom this moment on, set your minds at ease. Refine yourselves into a spiritual treasure beyond mortal recognition, dissolve all yin demons, and let no ghost dare intrude. With but a single revelation in the light of truth, what hundred koans cannot be resolved? What barriers remain? The fundamental nature is empty, yet it does not depart from the ten thousand phenomena—encompassing them, dissolving them. This single phrase alone breaks free from the cage.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"The practice of stillness.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"May I ask you—when is stillness? Where is stillness? If you seek only the comfort of this body, that is but a trifling art of nurturing life, something both heaven and earth and humankind despise—what is called the lazy path. How can this be called learning? How can it be called the Dao? The transformative power of the Dao is vast, luminous, and boundless; it flows unimpeded in every time and place. Its nurturing work is such that the Dao gives rise to the Dao, and from it all transformations emerge.*\n\n*Yet those who cultivate the Dao strive to flee the dust and abandon the worldly, unaware that one must harmonize with its light and merge with its dust—what does this mean? Heaven remains heaven, earth remains earth, and humankind remains humankind; none depart from the human realm—how then can one distance oneself from others? Moreover, the Dao does not stand apart from humankind. In daily life and ordinary conduct, nothing lies outside the Dao. The Dao resides in heaven and earth, becoming heaven and earth; the Dao resides in humankind, becoming humankind. By preserving the spirit and understanding transformation, how can the Dao be distant from humankind?\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"People differ in sharpness and dullness, and teachings vary in their expressions. Those of bright and vigorous nature, whose fundamental essence shines forth—whose clarity suffices to perceive the subtle workings and whose vigor suffices to reach decisive action—naturally find their effort converging on simplicity. They may proceed directly to the Buddha’s path, leaping straight into the realm of Thus-Come. But if one’s fundamental essence is obscured, it is because the work of attaining emptiness remains incomplete. Attaining emptiness is the accumulation of rightness. Rightness means fitting precisely to what is appropriate. Fitting precisely to what is appropriate is the exact point of the human heart—is this not the mean?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Even in a heart obscured by dullness, there is the light of awakening. The difference lies only in whether knowledge comes through struggle or ease. Only through illumination can one attain emptiness. When one reaches the exact point, there is no longer any contrivance.\"*\n\n*\"Verbal teachings, too, may be incomplete or imperfect, for they are but medicine applied to illness. If all scriptures and canons were bound to a single principle, one book would suffice—why then so many pages of endless repetition? Some teachings are addressed to great bodhisattvas, some point the way, some offer expedient means for the ignorant, and some are shared wisdom for the worthy. The* Daodejing *of the Most High, a work of celestial spontaneity and pristine return to the origin, has endured through the ages unscathed. It is the primordial qi of Great Harmony. The Great Dao is thereby made manifest, the* Heart Sutra *thereby established as its foundation, serving as a bridge for all generations. Though its meaning is plain on the surface, its hidden profundities are not ordinary. The various commentaries only scratch the surface—each sees what their virtue or wisdom allows. The common people use it daily yet remain unaware, and thus the Dao of the noble person is rare indeed.\"*\n\n*\"A person may do good or evil, may begin with good and turn to evil, or begin with evil and turn to good—there is no fixed judgment. Therefore, I neither lightly affirm nor lightly dismiss anyone. How can we know that one who comes later may not surpass the present?\"*",

      "translated_text": "**The Venerable Lü’s Exposition on the Golden Flower: Clarifying the Obscure in Dialogue**\n*By Qing Hui Jue*\n\n**Question:** The study of the primordial is of the heart-mind; the study of the postnatal is of traces. To escape the cycle of rebirth, must one cultivate in the formless?\n\n**Answer:** There is no way to cultivate in the formless. How, then, is cultivation to be done? One might suppose stillness yields attainment, while movement loses it. Yet they do not know that the loss in movement arises from the failure to attain in stillness. If stillness yields no attainment, movement incurs loss—both stem from not having penetrated the Dao. What you speak of as \"above form\" merely describes what ought to be, not how it comes to be. At present, one can only seek the traceless within traces. Within traces, the traceless is found: the deluded wander a thousand miles, while the awakened arrive in a single morning.\n\n**Further Question:** What does it mean to seek the traceless within traces?\n\n**Answer:**\n*In vain do men sigh, learning the arts of the fair maid;*\n*Seeking fragrance in subtlety, all remains one-sided.*\n*Not recognizing the central within the central, ever more central,*\n*The true mystery arises where no cause is given.*\n\n**Question:** How does the heart-mind attain stillness?\n\n**Answer:** To exhaustively investigate all things is difficult; to preserve it moment by moment is easy. Preservation means preserving the heart-mind. Only when the heart-mind is preserved does it have a master; only with a master can affairs be governed. Between a single grasp and a single release lies the division between heaven and humanity, the distinction between worthiness and foolishness—this cannot be taken lightly. Yet preserving the heart-mind is easily interrupted; with long practice, it becomes unbroken. Unbroken, it continues; continuing, it becomes luminous; luminous, qi is full. When qi is full, dullness and dispersion are dispelled without being dispelled.\n\nAlas! Among all matters under heaven, only this is great—all else is but trifling. Amidst a hundred busynesses, preserve a single inch; within ten thousand affairs, hold to one principle. Without embodying these two sayings, one will never enter the realm of the sages.\n\n**Question:** What of observing the heart-mind?\n\n**Answer:** Observe the heart-mind in clarity and stillness. The heart-mind is fundamentally non-dual, only the one pure and true. Extending before and behind, there is nothing else—it does not depart from the conditions of seeing and hearing, yet transcends them to ascend the Buddha’s ground.\n\nYet the observation of the heart-mind has depths: there is forced observation and natural observation; observation beyond the dust and within the dust; observation neither within nor without; and all-encompassing observation. Which will you observe?\n\nMy Way proceeds step by step, never skipping stages. Yet in the beginning and end of one’s practice, it does not exceed this: the starting hand is the finishing hand. Cultivation begins with observation—this is the work. When observation deepens and delusion is purified, true emptiness is attained. If one merely speaks of the principle of emptiness without engaging in observation and practice, it is but \"lip Chan.\" The ordinary person remains ordinary—what is the point of cultivation?\n\n**Question:** What of turning the light around to illuminate?\n\n**Answer:** *\"Without illumination, how can one see?\"*",

      "translated_text": "Without the raft, none can cross. Yet it is not by rejecting the raft that one crosses—crossing is the very act of crossing. The raft remains a raft; seeing the raft as no-raft, one knows crossing is not crossing.\n\nTurning the light around is not done with the eyes, but with the heart—heart is the eye. With long and steady concentration, the heart and eye become luminous. Those who have not realized this find it hard to speak of, for to do so risks the flaw of clinging to form. Failure to realize arises from depleted essence. Observe the heart’s awakened aperture to generate essence; as essence slightly congeals, it reveals itself, and the wondrous gateway of the Mysterious Pass appears. Only then does the work of inquiry and awakening find its ground—otherwise, it is but vague talk, and speaking of it brings only shame at deceiving others.\n\nAlas! The Great Dao is profound and truly hard to speak of—step by step, one reaches the blossoming flower. Within the flower is fruit, yet no fruit; this is how the ordinary person transcends the postcelestial.\n\nWithout vastness, the thousand ten-thousand subtle and graceful wisdoms would not arise. The Dharma seat is boundless in depth, and the teaching knows no limit. Wait until you have cultivated day by day, month by month, until the heart opens and the Buddha is seen—only then will you know that the dragon’s deep repose has not deceived me.\n\nAs for gazing at the navel, that is external work. The inner work arises when heart and eye are born—this is the true Elixir Field. Left-turning and right-turning share the same principle. The *Elixir Classic* says: *\"What is done by nature cannot be a deviant or false path.\"*\n\nSome see light before their eyes—this is the light of mice, not the light of tiger’s eyes or dragon’s essence. The light of the heart belongs neither to inner nor outer. If you see it with the eyes of form, it is already demonic. You have been defiled for so long that its true nature is hard to purify all at once.\n\nThe matter of life and death is grave. With a single thought, turn the light around, gather your spirit, and concentrate the illumination on your own heart—this is the Buddha-lamp. A house full of wealth is yours only if you recognize it truly; if not, how much can you truly absorb?\n\nThis matter of mine startles even gods and ghosts—only one of virtue can bear it. What is the Buddha-lamp? To keep it ever burning is the Buddha-lamp. Better than lighting lamps inside and outside the house to offer me is this single lamp, undimmed through the night, illuminating the five aggregates as empty—only then will you know the One Who Saves from Suffering, the Compassionate Avalokiteśvara.\n\nThe heart-lamp is possessed by all; merely light it brightly, and you become the immortal Great Immortal. Do not forget this heart, lest your spirit grow dim and masterless, scattering your essence.\n\nThis teaching directly reveals the essential principle of the Great Vehicle, a practice of sudden entry. The turning of the light is the clear state after death, not only in the present. I must press myself to speak of it so that you may generate faith—yet this is a great leak of heavenly mechanism.\n\nFollow this path, and without seeking results, results will come of themselves. Only then will your lifelong study be truly connected. Do not be like those who wander east today and west tomorrow, spouting wild fox Chan and calling it done.\n\n**Question:** What is the path to bodhi that leads home?\n\n**Answer:** You have never left home—only your own heart’s delusion has made south into north, turning a single step into a thousand-mile journey. In truth, it is right here. The jewel in your robe is still your own treasure.",

      "translated_text": "A single thought turning the light—this is already on the bodhi path, with home close at hand. The finest monastery need not be sought elsewhere; without leaving the household life, this very place is a forest grove. My mind-to-mind transmission of this Dharma is a practice of sudden entry in one leap, called \"preserving the root in cultivation.\" Those who gather power will unfold the vast brilliance of heaven and earth—nothing rare in this. Even those of shallow capacity and inferior roots will not lose the station of minor immortals or minor deities. Let all of you take this in.\n\n**Question:** Should one begin with the study of inherent nature?\n\n**Answer:** The study of inherent nature cannot be completed without the study of life-destiny. First, from nature, one probes to draw forth the workings of destiny; only when destiny is penetrated can nature be thoroughly realized. Nature without destiny is not thorough; destiny without nature is not complete. Thus the *Yijing* says: *\"Exhaust principle and fulfill nature, to reach destiny.\"* Having fulfilled nature, how then does one reach destiny? Without plumbing the depths to the very end, how can one know that the numinous treasure lies hidden here? It can give life to people, it can kill people—life and death rest solely in this, not in some other mysterious gateway.\n\n**Question:** May one abide in the nature of true thusness?\n\n**Answer:** How can the nature of true thusness be abided in? Since it is said to be thus—living, vivid, and thus—how can it tolerate conceptualization? If even conceptualization is impossible, how can it be abided in? Not abiding, yet abiding—there is nothing to abide in. To abide is to grasp and hold; true thusness does not appear. Do not cling. The four great elements are fundamentally empty; the five aggregates are not substantial. Where is there room for you to grope and seize?\n\n**Question:** Should one focus the mind in one place?\n\n**Answer:** To focus the mind in one place is certainly so, yet the mind has no fixed place and must be lively and fluid. True discernment does not lie in form or appearance; form and appearance belong to the acquired. Knowing is the function of the mind; emptiness and stillness are its essence. If one clings to the acquired, then the qi-nature dominates, principle is not exhausted, and realization cannot be attained.\n\n**Question:** If the mind is not focused in one place, how can one gain mastery?\n\n**Answer:** Transcending movement and stillness, one gains mastery; having no mastery is itself mastery. Do not be reckless. Drifting and floating, the manifestations of thunder, rain, wind, and clouds appear—creation’s workings are all revealed, living and vivid. This is not ordinary, yet it is ordinary. Heavenly flowers scatter in profusion; all the gods offer auspicious signs—truly worthy of celebration. Swiftly, in this lifetime, one resolution settles a hundred matters. Lifting the gaze, the great Dharma realm of divine light arises—all fruition emerges in a single radiance. What need is there to speak of clarity and brightness? Do not grasp. Examine carefully.",

      "translated_text": "Grasping only drives it farther away—fire blazes while water withers, water and fire unbalanced, how can the divine elixir endure? The Daoist speaks with bone-deep truth, no deception or force. You must keenly embody this: the great Dao lies before you, no need to wait for another life. In an instant, radiant light pervades, the five aggregates dissolve, and the world unfolds like a palm.\n\n**Question:** Does spirit enter qi?\n\n**Answer:** How could it enter? Spirit does not enter qi—it is nowhere absent. What is called \"spirit entering qi\" refers to the acquired spirit, not the primordial spirit’s path. In the foundational work, qi is the heart—discern this carefully, for it is the opening of the mysterious pass. If you force it, you carve; what you carve is not the opening of the mysterious pass but the qi of the entire body, fraught with danger—this must not be overlooked. The mysterious pass is the very center of heaven and earth. Within the aperture lies another aperture, yet there is no place to point. If there were a place to point, it would remain within the five agents of creation—how could it transcend creation? The mysterious learning does not fall into creation yet contains creation. Without personal realization through practice, one cannot speak of it phrase by phrase. The golden needle fits each sentence perfectly—silent comprehension suffices, no need for excessive words.\n\n**Question:** What of spirit and qi?\n\n**Answer:** Spirit has no substance; spirit is qi, and spirit and qi cannot be separated. Without qi, spirit has no ground to stand, nor can qi exist without it. The movement of qi is the movement of spirit.\n\n**Question:** If spirit and qi cannot be separated, why do Daoists speak of refining qi to transform into spirit?\n\n**Answer:** It means preserving clarity and shedding turbidity. Only clarity is numinous. Spirit is the clear aspect of qi. As for refining spirit to return to emptiness—is emptiness not qi? Qi is spirit, and spirit moves through qi, which is also called returning to its source.\n\n**Question:** What of using qi to resonate with qi?\n\n**Answer:** Using qi to resonate with qi is so. Yet if you refer to the qi within the human body, it is either true or ordinary and cannot be employed. When will you ascend to the immortal realm? It is not this insubstantial qi, untouchable as the faintest flicker of the heart. As for minor techniques of circulating qi, they may cultivate the physical body and prolong life, but if one insists that the great Dao must be practiced upon the physical body, such words belong to side paths. Even a slight attachment is not the Way. It must arise from non-attachment, transforming through illusion into function—not this kind of talk, but that kind of practice. The luminous Dharma realm allows no room for sentiment. The Buddha’s words are pleasing to the ear, the immortals’ music harmonious—pity that none understand, for there is no kindred spirit. In sum, external practices have no bearing on the great Dao. True cultivation of the Dao begins with refining essence into qi—this essence is not the essence of intercourse, as the alchemical texts have made abundantly clear. This first stage is already difficult to explain, let alone the matters of the second and third passes. The great Dao is profound, not a jest.\n\nSome, upon entering the path, mistake it for the ultimate end, unaware of what lies beyond the exit, or how to exit and re-enter.\n\n**Question:** What of cultivation?\n\n**Answer:** To cultivate is to remove defilement. Without defilement, what need is there for cultivation? To cultivate further is to place a head upon a head.\n\n**Question:** How to recognize it?\n\n**Answer:** To recognize is to recognize the essence. The essence of the heart is formless; recognition is the practice. Recognize one part, and you accumulate one part. Accumulate depth, and radiance flows—then the Dao is before your eyes. You still seek the essence through function; only when the essence manifests will wondrous function arise. Wondrous function reveals the essence, yet people remain unaware.\n\n**Question:** The three powers establish the pole—what is the human pole?\n\n**Answer:** The human pole lies in the heart, which is the heart of heaven. In humans, it is called human; in heaven, it is called heaven. The Lord oversees you—there is no second heart. The original heart connects to heaven, thus to the Lord. A single thought of resonance, and you join the ranks of immortals. You are unlearned, and I am ashamed I have not taught you. I shall now reveal what I have concealed.\n\nWhat is spoken of is called the Supreme Ultimate. The principle of the Supreme Ultimate pervades heaven and humanity. Heaven is founded upon it to establish the pole of yin and yang, and the ceaseless mechanism of generation originates here. Humans possess this principle, yet it is obscured by selfishness, so its principle does not manifest, leaving only its substance. In movement and stillness, they lean and falter, unaware, drifting through years and months, flowing heedlessly, unrestrained and reckless, vanishing in an instant without return.\n\nAlas! A single flash of red light, and all dissolves like ice—none know where it has gone. As the saying goes: \"The scholar aspires to be a worthy, the worthy to be a sage.\" To return is to rely on the extension of knowledge. The essence of extending knowledge lies in the heart. When the heart is pure and sincere, one advances ceaselessly; when the heart is tainted and scattered, one drifts without end.\n\nAlas! Alas!",

      "translated_text": "You, my disciples, have attended me for long, yet I dared not directly reveal the essence. For those who cultivate stillness and reverence are few, and those who embody sincerity and unity are rare—thus the Dao does not manifest without cause. Amidst the clamor of wind and rain, human affairs drift idly; when expounding profound truths, much is but empty verbiage in the void. Without accumulated virtue, one has no refuge, so they treat worldly affairs as a ladder—when the moment is ripe, they ascend; when it is not, they remain mired in red dust. Heaven and Earth are impartial—why scheme with cunning? You may attend to matters, but ensure your spirit does not scatter. Like a roaring fire in the furnace, only with focused intent can you enter the path of bodhi and realize nirvana. Otherwise, your discourse will be vague, your purpose obscure, and you will not grasp the true source of your own nature and life—how then can you progress?\n\n**Question:** In all subtle cultivation, must one seek what is constant and personally relevant?\n**Answer:** What cultivation? It is not in action yet profoundly present, not in solemnity yet reverent. With steadfast devotion, one holds fast to oneself—manifest and hidden unite, substance and function are undivided. Where is the effort, and where is it not? The great Dao is silent and yielding, ever fitting, ever at peace in all things.\n\n**Question:** I only know stillness as substance and movement as function, the manifest as evident and the hidden as concealed. Divided thus, I cannot unite them as one. You previously taught \"manifest and hidden unite, substance and function are undivided\"—does this refer to the formless?\n**Answer:** Within form lies the formless; within the \"center,\" there is neither \"form\" nor \"formless.\" The center within the center—internally examine the undividedness of substance and function, seek the unfathomable in the hidden and manifest.\n\n**Question:** You taught that \"not in action yet profoundly present, not in solemnity yet reverent\" means effort is everywhere and nowhere—is this the unity of manifest and hidden, the undividedness of substance and function? If we speak of what flows, clearly there is movement and stillness. Is it that movement and stillness are natural, and their unity lies in desirelessness? Or is it that the myriad changes cannot escape the vastness of the Great Void, hence their unity and undividedness?\n**Answer:** Waves arise in water—are waves not water? Though outwardly moving, inwardly they contain stillness. The wave is the wave, the water is the water—thus it is. Concealed within, expressed without—how can they not be called united, undivided?\n\n**Question:** Is it by preserving the heart to extend knowledge?\n**Answer:** What is there to preserve?\n\n**Question:** When knowledge is extended, the mirror is bright; when the mirror is bright, stains appear. Not even the slightest obscurity remains—what is illuminated is fully revealed, and dregs dissolve entirely.\n**Answer:** Its nurturing and its harm both lie herein. Examine within: there is no single master. Like the sun and moon’s cycles, the cold and heat’s fixed seasons, the four seasons’ alternation, the eight nodes’ rise and fall—when harmonized within this, the year’s work is complete, and movement proceeds without hindrance. Herein lies the establishment of destiny, the dwelling of nature. You must burn incense and quietly verify—with time, you will gain insight. Long anchored on rivers and lakes, clouds veil the western mountains. Yet when the sun rises, it is the appointed hour.",

As the saying goes: \"The scholar aspires to be a worthy, the worthy to be a sage.\" To return is to rely on the extension of knowledge. The essence of extending knowledge lies in the heart. When the heart is pure and sincere, one advances ceaselessly; when the heart is tainted and scattered, one drifts without end.\n\nAlas! Alas!",

      "translated_text": "**Question:** To be vigilant and earnest *is* the original substance; the original substance is inherently vigilant and earnest. Aligning with this original substance *is* the work of cultivation—what is called \"unmoving yet subtle, unsolemn yet reverent.\" Viewed in terms of its clarity, it is called *knowledge*; viewed in terms of its discernment, it is called *reverence*; viewed in terms of its absence of delusion, it is called *sincerity*; viewed in terms of the life-principle inherent within, it is called *benevolence*; viewed in terms of its indivisibility into inner and outer, its lack of distinction between movement and stillness, its boundlessness as the Supreme Ultimate, it is called *the One*. With steadfast reverence, the world is at peace. *The Mean* is harmony; speak of the Mean, and harmony is already within it; speak of harmony, and the Mean need not be mentioned. In movement, there is nothing that is not harmonious—thus in stillness, there is nothing that is not centered. Inner and outer are one, head upright and tail straight?\n\n**Answer:** Speak of it constantly, practice it constantly. Ordinary words, ordinary deeds—perfect sincerity without delusion. The three schools’ deepest secrets require no further discourse.\n\n**Question:** Yesterday, you spoke of the mirror’s brightness revealing stains, and you instructed: \"Its nurturing and its harm both lie herein.\" Does this mean that both self-cultivation and introspection arise from this, as do the distractions of desires and splendor? Is this the *yin spirit* of unrefined essence, what the Buddhists call *seed-nature*?\n\n**Answer:** Will you doubt it? Or will you believe it? There is a clear and open great path—when you reach that point, you will naturally advance. With time, the seed-nature will transform into Buddha-nature.\n\n**Question:** By tracing the root, can one attain sudden awakening?\n\n**Answer:** Seeking the root and probing to the depths, you reach the sea’s edge—there, a yaksha appears. Only when *yin* is at its extreme can *yang* be born. Before reaching the utmost *yin*, the source cannot be penetrated. To explore the root is precisely the wondrous method of neither clinging to emptiness nor to existence. This is my singular transmission—it penetrates heaven and earth, bringing boundless joy in the Great Dao. The *yang spirit* pervades the universe; in one breath, it drinks the waters of the Jiangxi. The lion leaps forth from its den, and the myriad beasts fall silent in awe. Hmph! What are the petty paths and side doors worth hearing? I tell you: set aside all talk of the fleshly body. Follow this and delve into the heart’s source—this is seeking the mystery in the *Kan* palace, where the water-dwelling dragon emerges. Without probing the waters, without investigating the source, it is all mere surface upon surface. To speak of the Dao to others is but to seek an empty reputation—what is called \"hanging up a sign to practice,\" the great taboo of my school. In this inquiry, you must truly inquire; in this awakening, you must truly awaken. Penetrating heaven and earth, all is the *Dharmakāya*, all is the radiance of my nature.\n\n**Question:** *Kan* and *Li*?\n\n**Answer:** They are the transformations of the primordial, neither deliberate nor silent. Even half a word of this mystery—if you grasp it, you attain the true and constant; if you do not, it remains useless. It is like handling affairs: one must find the right person, someone of balanced use, for the task to succeed. Otherwise, east and west remain divided—wood three, metal four—how can the depths be fathomed? This is bone-deep counsel; do not neglect it!\n\n**Question:** When thoughts swarm in confusion, one thought has not ceased before another arises—like a fish gulping water, mouth in, gills out; like the summer solstice, days long and nights short. If one cannot even fix one’s gaze on the wondrous *mysterious female* aperture, how can one hope for the true mechanism’s opening and closing, smooth as silk and continuous as floss?\n\n**Answer:** The mind-ground’s brightness illuminates past and present—how can you say the *mysterious female* has no root? With long and subtle practice, you will fully recognize *yin* and *yang* as the mechanism’s precursor.\n\n**Question:** Without the sun and moon, heaven and earth remain hidden; when the sun and moon withdraw, heaven and earth become chaotic. When spirit and *qi* unite, *qi* congeals and spirit coagulates—is this the union of *Kan* and *Li*?\n\n**Answer:** *Kan* and *Li* unite in the realm of the unknowing and unaware, yet their movement never ceases for even a moment. The Way of Heaven is ever-shifting, its wonder lying in its unforced harmony, not in deliberate action. Life and death are surely in Heaven’s hands—does Heaven have a mind?\n\n**Question:** The union of *Kan* and *Li* occurs within, and from this the great medicine is born. A single spark of the original nature glimmers faintly, concealed in the *Kun* belly. Its light pierces the curtains, pure and free of dust. Breath settles, *qi* calms, and only empty clarity remains—is this the heart of heaven and earth, governing the myriad transformations?\n\n**Answer:** When *qi* calms and breath settles, this is the principle of the mechanism’s revival—hence its liveliness, what is commonly called the *living midnight hour*.\n\n**Further Question:** From this subtlety to full manifestation, it corresponds to the three *yang* of the *Qian* hexagram. When the three *yang* retreat, they become three *yin*—this is the *small celestial cycle*. Re-entering the womb, nature returns to destiny. When stored long and released suddenly, fierce fire soars. This is fire’s dryness, which may stir the post-heaven emotions. Thus, one draws in and closes to prevent danger, causing it to descend without generating; one gathers and licks to assist the fire, causing it to ascend, clear and indestructible. This is the *great union*, the matching of true mercury. Emptiness *is* true mercury, *is* nature’s emptiness. Their union occurs within and beyond—from this, one retreats the tally and conceals it in the earthen crucible, refining it again and again, preserving clarity and discarding turbidity, until reaching the ultimate void. Is this the *absolute learning without care*?\n\n**Answer:** If you do not address the root, how can you order the branches? Wind, rain, thunder, clouds—who governs them?",

      "translated_text": "Who can halt or restrain it? Cultivating the self is like holding jade—grinding its flaws, chiseling its blemishes. The work runs deep, the effort accumulates, and its luster is not achieved in a single moment; without great power, this cannot be accomplished. To change morning and evening, stirred by a fleeting impulse, is to let qi settle in one corner. This is what is meant by jade with a blemish—once stained, cleansing is difficult. Strive with all your might: Kan and Li are what give rise to Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are what name Kan and Li. Kan and Li are what transform Qian and Kun.\n\n**Question:** When the topmost gate’s bolt is stirred, it suddenly opens and closes of its own accord—sometimes thus, sometimes not thus; not thus within thus. Does this reach the intent? Does it follow the flow of Heaven’s mandate? At this moment, the Dao-eye is clear and bright, Heaven opens the realm of longevity, all things manifest in full, vast and profound. The Treasury of the True Dharma Eye, the wondrous mind of Nirvana—ever more lively, ever more lucid. The *Elixir Classic* says: *\"Though he acts as host and I as guest, it is the external that becomes host, while I am reduced to guest.\"* Simply do not forget the illuminating mind, allowing it to transmute the yin within the abdomen—this may be called the Celestial King’s Heart-Supplementing Elixir. This is the essence of using spirit to guide qi, and qi to control essence. Is this not akin to the hawk seizing the swallow, the falcon striking the winter crow?\n\n**Answer:** A wondrous discourse indeed.\n\n**Further question:** Harmonizing light with dust yet remaining unstained, worldly affairs cannot cling to him. By its movement, it is called the River Chariot; by its non-violation of Heaven, it is called the Dharma Wheel. Round as an egg, white as silk, soft as cotton, light as a wave. When hard, it is an iron-spined man; when formed in sheets, it is like seawater soaking a dike; when it cannot contain itself, it overturns earth and lifts the sky. Rising as clouds, descending as rain, lightning flashes and thunder roars—addition and subtraction appear of their own accord. The dripping of the water clock, the primordial wine fit to taste; all such opportunities are but links in a single chain. Is it said that only with something can creation and transformation arise?\n\n**Answer:** It cannot be described, for description sets boundaries. Such profound talk cannot be taken as achievement. In sum: accumulate an inch, and it becomes an inch thicker; accumulate a foot, and it becomes a foot thicker. Square to resemble Earth, round to resemble Heaven—emptiness does not appear empty, fullness does not appear full. Emptiness and fullness are not distinct; everywhere, the marvelous arises. Not seeing is not the end, nor is seeing the finality. Ha-ha! A great laugh—utterly impenetrable.\n\n**Question:** In the dust yet beyond the dust.\n\n**Answer:** Not merely this—this is but the beginning stage. In the dust yet beyond the dust still leaves dust present; it is not causeless. When cause and effect shine as one, all is perfectly balanced—spring colors overflow the stream. What more can be said? Within wordlessness, jade-like words emerge.\n\n**Question:** Moving yet not moving, still yet not still—is this unity?\n\n**Answer:** Movement is not an obstacle, stillness is not stagnation. Movement is stillness, yet stillness is not movement. Movement and stillness unite—continuous and dense, a fine womb-breath.\n\n**Question:** What is continuous and dense?\n\n**Answer:** Ever more still, only then is it continuous and dense.\n\n**Question:** Does the heart follow movement and stillness in circulation?\n\n**Answer:** Whether the heart follows movement and stillness or not, it is circulation. The heart without heart—how can it be distinguished?\n\n**Question:** Then is there no distinction?\n\n**Answer:** Distinction is no distinction.\n\n**Question:** Is continuous and dense the true Dao?\n\n**Answer:** Continuous and dense must return to not continuous and not dense—step by step, the path to Tiantai.\n\n**Question:** The human body is entirely yin. Even when sitting in utter clarity, it is but the post-heaven yin soul subduing disease roots. A ladle of stagnant water—once stirred, it becomes turbid. To gather the heart in one place day and night only risks startling it at the slightest touch, turning it into a heart ailment. Why not, at the year’s end and the new year’s beginning, seek a message within the emptiness atop the Five Skandhas’ mountain? Those who grasp it live freely; those who do not merely toy with spirits.\n\n**Answer:** What can be known cannot be practiced; what can be practiced cannot be fully known.",

Pitch-black, boundless white, transformation occurs in an instant—how could it be grasped by conjecture?\n\n**Question:** What is *bathing*?\n\n**Answer:** *Bathing* means to wash away filth. Roaming freely between heaven and earth, the heart’s field becomes vast and unobstructed; the numinous mechanism flows freely, and the myriad sensations all turn to emptiness. Alas! When man becomes heaven, and heaven becomes the unfathomable spirit—how wondrous, how mysterious!\n\nLight is the function of the heart; emptiness and stillness are its substance. If emptiness and stillness are not luminous, stillness is not true stillness, emptiness is not true emptiness—it is but a ghost’s den, and the Great Dao is not like this. Once the primordial essence is lost, there is no place to verify emptiness—truly, one falls into *emptiness and annihilation*.\n\nExternal paths speak of grinding the sun and moon at the world’s edge, or hanging one’s comings and goings in the grass, boasting of the vastness of the sea’s waters and the shimmer of a thousand acres of golden waves. The world is deluded by external paths and the comings and goings of ghosts’ dens—how difficult to change! You disciples, quietly uphold my Dao and do not let your hearts be shaken or confused.\n\nI wish for you to ascend to the supreme vehicle, not to descend into the middle or lower streams—the middle and lower streams are not the ultimate good. The ultimate good is limitless: in movement and stillness, no constancy; in spirit, unfathomable mystery. Though its substance is without distinction, its function manifests without fixed form. *'Before heaven, it does not oppose heaven; after heaven, it accords with heaven’s timing'*—the numinous brightness remains self-so.\n\n**Question:** Is *regulating the breath* the breath of the nostrils?\n\n**Answer:** The breath of the nostrils pertains to the external breath of the physical body. Only when heart and breath depend on each other is it the true breath. As the Venerable Prajñā said: *'The outgoing breath does not follow the myriad conditions; the incoming breath does not dwell in the skandha realm.'* How could this be the nostrils?\n\nThe opening and closing of the mechanism’s subtleties cannot be glimpsed in a single moment—it must be accumulated through long and strenuous effort. One day, it will suddenly penetrate through, and heaven and earth will be found to lie within. Man is the *'Great'*—the Three Powers stand as one, the myriad transformations share a single root. Do not seek it in the physical body, and the true breath will naturally appear. The true breath has no breath, yet breath exists—alas! The great mechanism is revealed!\n\nTo be *lively and free*—as for observing the breath or listening to the breath, these too pertain to the physical body. They are used to gather the heart, but they are not the true lifeline. The true lifeline must be sought from within the true. Observation and listening are one matter.\n\n**Question:** What about *regulating the breath as a practice*?\n\n**Answer:** Regulating the breath indeed involves practice, but the explanations are not uniform. There is external respiration and internal respiration; there is ordinary breath and spirit-breath. *Embryonic breathing* is spirit-breath—without breath, there is no embryo; without an embryo, there is no breath. The practice of embryonic breathing begins with the breath. If it is embryonic breathing, then *'the true person’s breath reaches the heels'*—how profound! These are words that hit the mark.\n\nDo not distinguish between internal and external—yet there is internal and external.\"",
      "overlap_context": " disease roots. A ladle of stagnant water—once stirred, it becomes turbid. To gather the heart in one place day and night only risks startling it at the slightest touch, turning it into a heart ailment. Why not, at the year’s end and the new year’s beginning, seek a message within the emptiness atop the Five Skandhas’ mountain? Those who grasp it live freely; those who do not merely toy with spirits.\n\n**Answer:** What can be known cannot be practiced; what can be practiced cannot be fully known.",

      "translated_text": "The distinction between internal and external refers to the three barriers; the absence of such distinction is the unity of movement and stillness. To become perfectly merged into one is called *transformation*. Without transformation, one cannot speak of the numinous, nor has one seen the Dao. Even if there are moments of awakening, they are but sunlight breaking through clouds—fleeting glimpses. The radiance of sun and moon illuminates all under heaven; this is no ghostly realm.\n\n**Question:** The embryo arises from breath. During the state of hibernation, it is *concealed qi*. Over time, external respiration ceases, leaving only internal respiration, and the golden embryo of the spirit-chamber coalesces within. Are such practices entirely the work of natural creation, not to be forced?\n\n**Answer:** It is inconceivable—suddenly entering the inconceivable is precisely this. It is not reckless disregard that makes it inconceivable. In the state of hibernation, the embryo is internal respiration. The work of penetrating the three teachings is what is called *spirit-breath*—the *wu* and *ji* of the center. What is external respiration worth mentioning? If the work is not yet complete, it lacks perfection; to abandon the ladder and ascend to heaven is to find the subtle mechanism hidden within the sage, where a single spark of numinous light shines forth in myriad forms.\n\n**Question:** Is this subtle mechanism *qi*?\n\n**Answer:** It is *qi*, and it must be nurtured with care. This is made clear—none of the scriptures dare speak of the apertures as the gateway.\n\n**Question:** When this subtle mechanism manifests in the central palace, what then?\n\n**Answer:** One phrase surpasses a hundred. There is authority and substance, illumination and application. Only when it touches the very itch does it become the language of attainment.\n*\"The utmost yin is solemn,\nThe utmost yang is blazing;\nSolemnity emerges from heaven,\nBlazing arises from earth.\"*\nThis is the teaching of *kan* and *li*.\n\n**Question:** Does spirit depend on form for its existence?\n\n**Answer:** Spirit does not depend on form. What do you take to be spirit? Penetrate this single word, and your entire being will be at peace.\n\n**Question:** What if spirit and *qi* are insufficient?\n\n**Answer:** Insufficiency of spirit and *qi* stems from long-standing depletion. Nurture them well, and when replenished, they will rise in brilliance. The dragon-tiger mystery-gate will suddenly appear, and you will realize that the three realms are but your own mind, while your mind transcends the three realms—yet contains them, perfectly interpenetrating and unobstructed. The compassionate light of all buddhas and immortals will bathe your crown, a rare and wondrous sight. This is the sign of a flourishing age, a scene of great peace—not entirely so, yet one part contains the whole. To achieve one part is to have one part unresolved, yet when one part is resolved, it remains but one part. How can peering through a narrow tube at the sky be considered attainment?\n\n**Question:** Are the five phases merely yin and yang, belonging to the postnatal?\n\n**Answer:** Does the prenatal lack the five phases? Only when the five phases are complete do the postnatal five phases arise. Without the prenatal five phases, from where would the postnatal five phases emerge? The essence of the Dao is formless, yet all phenomena are already inherent within it. While ancient and modern have their sequence, the principle of the five phases generating life knows no before or after.\n\n**Question:** Is harmony and smoothness *spirit-water*?\n\n**Answer:** It is not yet *spirit-water*. The wondrous function of spirit-water washes away the emptiness of nature; impurities dissolve, as gentle as spring wind. Whatever it touches is transformed, unbound by any cage.\n*\"In the empty mountains, do not stand idle;\nExotic flavors are spoken of as delicacies.\nSated to the bone, inscribed in heart and marrow,\nLet not the spirit-water flow in vain.\nA single drop returns to the root,\nAnd all things converge at the source.\nWhy trouble with other concerns?\nWhat cause is there for attachment?\"*\n\n**Question:** What of the *wu* and *ji* earths?\n\n**Answer:** A single ripple at the center divides into *wu* and *ji*, yet there is no gate.\n\n**Question:** What of refining the self to await the moment?\n\n**Answer:** Only by refining the self can one await the moment. Without refinement, there is no moment to await.\n\n**Question:** Are the *wu* and *ji* earths the wondrous function of the prenatal, the unity of the profound and the meditative?\n\n**Answer:** The wondrous function of the prenatal is not easily attained; it must be accumulated through postnatal effort. Only when human effort is exhausted does heavenly power arise—this is true practice, the very beginning of the bodhi path.\n\n**Question:** Is the great essential of the golden elixir found in the *wu* and *ji* earths, true yin and true yang, the true mystery and the true feminine? Without meeting this kindred force to apply the work, how can one gather the mechanism through mechanism? Transforming the mortal body, breaking through barriers and nodes—all depend on this great function manifesting. Like wind and clouds, thunder and rain, it harmonizes with creation, far beyond the reach of dry cultivation. Is this what is meant by harmonious union and gathering, ensuring certain accomplishment?\n\n**Answer:**\n*\"Dissimilar kinds cannot be forced to skill,\nTrue work is solid work.\nDistinguish the traces before your eyes,\nSeparation and union are one in the same.\"*\nWho perceives the wind, clouds, thunder, and rain within? Do not cling to phenomena—enter them, yet seek the phenomenon within phenomena, and know the mind within the mind.\n\n**Question:** Must one attain the great stillness of true emptiness before the self-earth can be called *ding*?\n\n**Answer:** The *wu* and *ji* earths have depth and shallowness. When fully penetrated, they are still *wu* and *ji*; when not fully penetrated yet treated as such, they remain *wu* and *ji*. In the great *ding* of true emptiness, the light of wisdom shines universally, and the fragrant sea observes the compassionate clouds.\n\n**Question:** Does the *ji* earth die so that the *wu* earth may live?\n\n**Answer:** The *ji* earth does not die. If the *ji* earth dies, the *wu* earth cannot live. The birth of *wu* is the life of *ji*—without this, nothing can be revealed.\n\n**Question:** Must the *ji* earth be refined to the point of utter detachment before the *wu* earth arises?\n\n**Answer:** Even so, once the *ji* earth is sufficiently refined, the *wu* earth immediately arises. Only when the *wu* earth is born can the yin stagnation within the *ji* earth be dissolved. Otherwise, it remains but a yin spirit—even with some attainment, it is merely a ghostly immortal, not the way of our teaching. Without drinking the returning-soul nectar, how can the yin *po* be dissolved and concealed? Most of you possess middling or lesser capacities; you must proceed step by step, not skipping stages. When the nature of heaven is seen, there is no constraint; without seeing the nature of heaven, you grope about like a barrel of black lacquer, blindly seeking direction. How can dry meditation without basis be considered lofty and transcendent?",

      "translated_text": "To distinguish is to sunder motion and stillness, rendering even the primordial *qi* transformed into the postnatal. To unite is to make the postnatal *qi* itself primordial, with no division of before or after. If there be before and after, it is but the discrimination of the mind. Discrimination gives rise to the flourishing of the postnatal and the tumult of thoughts and cares.\n\nThat which cannot be spoken, cannot be named—this is the ancestral *qi*, the very substance of the Dao. With substance established, function follows. Substance and function undivided—this is no mere careless generalization. Those who realize it know; those who do not remain outsiders.\n\n**Question:** What distinguishes the primordial from the postnatal?\n\n**Answer:** Where there is attachment, all is postnatal; where there is no attachment, there is the primordial. Where to seek the primordial? One must seek it within the postnatal. The postnatal’s emotions and perceptions are the primordial’s wondrous function. One must delve into the work of harmonizing and aligning. In harmonizing and aligning, there is stillness and emptiness—though not yet pure, for it remains wholly dross. Through long fusion, the dross is smelted away; purity arises of itself, unforced, and the golden elixir emerges from the furnace.\n\n**Question:** The *Dan Jing* says: “At dawn, *zhun*; at dusk, *meng*.”\n\n**Answer:** “Dawn *zhun*, dusk *meng*”—these are but metaphors. The fire-tending of advance and retreat is seen in an instant; why must one use the *zhun* hexagram at dawn and the *meng* hexagram at dusk? The profound mechanism eludes most, so my teaching cuts straight to the essence.\n\n**Question:** What of union, ascent, descent, and inversion?\n\n**Answer:** It is all one continuous matter. Grasp one phrase, and the whole body comes alive; head and feet reverse, shattering heaven and earth. A carefree Daoist, untroubled—yet possessing learning to order heaven and earth, power to overturn seas and move mountains. Ah, how vast! How could worldly dust ever burden the heart? It is only the human mind’s delusion, clinging to its own views—one unprecedented marvel after another.\n\n**Question:** Why can one not master the night?\n\n**Answer:** By day, the conscious spirit holds sway; by night, the conscious spirit retreats into dormancy. The seeds of evil deeds sown in one’s lifetime remain untransformed, so when conditions arise, they sprout. This is no path of sudden transcendence, no single stroke that severs all.\n\n**Question:** Must greed, anger, ignorance, and desire be eradicated to be true Daoist learning?\n\n**Answer:** So it seems—yet there is more to say. Greed, anger, ignorance, and desire are the functions of inherent nature, what we call *qing* (emotion). People lost in emotion do not know inherent nature—this is the state of the foolish. To know inherent nature yet not know emotion is to fall into dead emptiness. Thus, my teaching is lively and unbound, spanning heaven and earth, uniting past and present, equalizing self and other, free of enmity or favor. In bustling markets or deep mountains, galloping through pure realms—awakened golden immortals, flawless, are utterly joyous. From filth, the lotus blooms; in a snap of the fingers, one leaps beyond all learning. The thousand-handed, thousand-eyed Avalokiteśvara—is this mere trivial talk?\n\n**Question:** What of benefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle?\n\n**Answer:** Benefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle is good, yet beings are hard to exhaust, and exhausting principle exhausts beings. Grasp the fundamental, and it unifies the ten thousand differences—this suffices. Can you distinguish within non-distinction? Can you be without distinction within distinction? Do not cling to partial speech. Habitual tendencies must be removed, but understanding principle is paramount. When principle is understood, habitual tendencies fade of themselves—what need is there to strive to remove them? Striving to remove them fails to remove them and only wastes effort.\n\nBenefiting beings and exhaustively investigating principle—speaking of the mind, in steadfast contemplation, one already benefits beings and exhausts principle. Steadfast contemplation is not one thing, and exhausting principle another. Begin with steadfast contemplation, and you will know the truth. With no selfishness, the heart is open and vast; spirit clear, *qi* bright—Buddhas and immortals. But for the slightest thought, the iron pillar roots run deep, and escape is difficult. Thus, one must observe and illuminate the mind, seeing it for oneself. Only then do the roots wither, and the thought of transcending the dust, the opportunity to enter the path, arise. Otherwise, one remains ignorant of one’s own inversion—how can one renew oneself, renew others, and unify all?\n\nRest for a moment, briefly observe the mind. After all have observed, I say: This very place is the monastery—where to seek *prajñā*?\n\n**Question:** What of external practices?\n\n**Answer:** Internal practice is observation; external practice is embracing unity. A *huatou* or a *gong’an*—cultivate both inner and outer, and there will come a time when spiritual moisture suffuses the body, the face glows, and the back brims with vitality. Simply observe me—no external practice, yet my body is naturally robust. This is your example.\n\n**Question:** Inherent nature is the same, but emotions differ.\n\n**Answer:** Emotions, too, are not different. It is only through habit, unexamined, that they have flowed and turned to this day, polluted and inextricably bound—this is not the fault of inherent nature. Inherent nature has no words—what is there to exhaust? Even words do not lie outside inherent nature.\n\nHave you not heard? Water may be clear or turbid, but its wetness is the same. Clear water is wet—is turbid water not also wet? Though clear and turbid differ, the nature of wetness does not. Contemplate this single point, and in time, sudden comprehension will dawn. Strive on.\n\nMoreover, emotion is inherent nature; inherent nature is emotion. Like an archer—bow and arrow are but tools; their function is a single living mechanism. How can it be grasped or imagined? The bow shoots the arrow, yet the living mechanism does not leave the bow. When the arrow leaves the bow, the arrow loses its living mechanism. This is the analogy of form and emptiness—do you all understand?\n\n**Question:** Is the primordial attained only after essence, *qi*, and spirit are set aside?\n\n**Answer:** Wrong. You know only the Dao of purity and non-action, not the natural principle of yin and yang. Yin and yang do not stand alone.",

      "translated_text": "What is heaven and earth without the ten thousand things? They would no longer be heaven. Heaven contains the ten thousand things—do the ten thousand things obscure even a thread of heaven? Observe the scene before your eyes: all things arrayed in profusion—have they ever hindered the clear and empty? It is precisely through the ten thousand things that the clear and empty is revealed. The true and real Dao is thus, thus.\n\n**Question:** How to engage in *chan* meditation?\n**Answer:** In *chan* meditation, one must arouse the *doubt-sensation*. With doubt comes awakening; without doubt, no awakening. The *doubt-sensation* is most difficult to arouse—only the ancient sages could do so. Many have attained great liberation from a single casual word or half-sentence after serving a good teacher for years. The Chan school is excellent, but one must engage in it skillfully. Those who do not engage skillfully fall into its pitfalls: looking down on all things, claiming equality with all buddhas, yet possessing not even half a speck. You must engage skillfully.\n\nYou believe that the highest vehicle of the Buddha’s practice is to ascend to the clouds in a single bound or traverse a thousand miles in worn-out sandals—this is the delusion of your mind, not the true path of the Buddha. The Buddha’s teachings begin from the highest point to guide people toward the ultimate, not to leave them stranded in vague, unfounded notions. His compassionate heart seeks to lead all beings. You think that initial practice can reach the shore in a day or night, without cultivation, nurturing, refinement, or polishing. I fear that the mediocre, even in old age, will fail to awaken on their own—such people are scorned by the sages.\n\n**Question:** How to achieve the utmost emptiness and profound stillness?\n**Answer:** Utmost emptiness and profound stillness cannot be attained in a single moment. To know stillness is not stillness; not to know stillness is also not stillness—it is merely muddy water. If you can empty yourself even a little, you will gain a little lightness and joy. This is the gradual method—how many possess the sudden capacity? It is only because of deep-seated habits and impurities that the name of cultivation arises. From now on, recognize the truth in the field of the heart. Illusion is not real—what, then, is real? Proceed from here, and one day, when you shatter the heavenly barrier, your feet and head will reverse, and only then will you find some path.\n\n**Question:** If illusion is not real, must it be completely eradicated?\n**Answer:** Though illusion is not eradicated, it can be put to use. All herbs are medicinal ingredients; when honey is mixed with them to form pills, they become *elixir of herbs*. Without herbs, medicine cannot be made; without medicine, illness cannot be cured—how can they be discarded? The petty man should be transformed, not eradicated; eradication invites disaster. The principle is the same.\n\n**Question:** What does it mean for feet and head to reverse?\n**Answer:** It means transformation—when you see ice melt and tiles dissolve. In Confucianism, \"joyful harmony with principle, like ice melting away\" is somewhat similar, though the strength of power, depth of practice, speed of realization, and sharpness of innate capacity differ. Chan says, \"Before the great matter is clarified, one is like one who has lost one’s parents\"—why, then, after the great matter is clarified, does one still resemble one who has lost one’s parents?\n\nIt is also said: The great Dao does not reside in stillness. Sitting still in a room only fans the flames of the heart’s fire. The work must be done in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—only then can one sit atop a thousand peaks without leaving the bustling crossroads. Do you all understand what I am saying?\n\n**Question:** My wisdom is insufficient to realize the Dao.\n**Answer:** What insufficiency is there? In terms of the original substance, there is no lack—it is naturally complete, neither increased nor diminished. In terms of the stages of practice, there is insufficiency. What is insufficient? Morning defilement and evening contamination turn clear water into muddy sludge; it cannot be settled, and stirring only makes it murkier—this is the origin of the discourse on cultivation. To cultivate is to cultivate conduct; when conduct is cultivated, nature is also cultivated.\n\n**Question:** Must one attain the *Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom* to realize the Dao?\n**Answer:** That is but an empty name. Boundlessness is \"great,\" wisdom penetrating all is \"perfect,\" radiant illumination is \"mirror,\" and selflessness is \"wisdom.\" It is not a literal mirror of true suchness but merely the meaning of a mirror. Do not cling to it.\n\n**Question:** What is the difference between *discernment* and *wisdom*?\n**Answer:** Discernment is wisdom. In ordinary beings, it is called *discernment*; in immortals and buddhas, it is called *wisdom*—only the distinction between purity and impurity remains.\n\n**Question:** When the three temporal states are cut off, is the *post-heaven* exhausted?\n**Answer:** Not so. Though the three temporal states are cut off, the *post-heaven* is not exhausted. Proceeding along the middle way, there are countless transformations and generations, refining the dregs. If all were completely purified, there could be no transformations or generations—it is difficult to uproot the fundamental consciousness entirely. This is my esoteric transmission, unknown even to the gods, let alone shallow-learning ordinary beings! Outside the five phases, where can the true teaching be found? The dragon’s path is not the rabbit’s trail; shallow grass does not run deep.\n\n**Question:** What is *vital impulse*?\n**Answer:** When *vital impulse* overflows, it is great liveliness. Without liveliness, it is insufficient to aid the Dao.\n\n**Question:** What is *the knife’s edge*?\n**Answer:** The *knife’s edge* pertains to subtle channels—drink the *soul-returning nectar* first.\n\n**Question:** Is illusion not real?\n**Answer:** Do you know illusion? To know illusion is to depart from it. The wondrous enlightenment of true emptiness is never deluded—it is only time that shatters it. Illusory appearances, being without form, reveal the constant flow of reality. The constant flow of reality is not the universal protection of the discerning mind. When one method is relinquished, all methods become manifest. Step upon the plum blossoms atop the head—*tap, tap, tap*—there is another immortal supported on the palm. Tattered robes and begging for food are not for selling magic talismans. *Spit, spit, spit*—non-action and purity are the master.\n\n**Question:** What is *leisurely nurturing*?\n**Answer:** *Leisurely nurturing* is transformation. Small things have small transformations; great things have great transformations. Transformation is spirit—only through transformation can one speak of spirit.",
      "overlap_context": " living mechanism. How can it be grasped or imagined? The bow shoots the arrow, yet the living mechanism does not leave the bow. When the arrow leaves the bow, the arrow loses its living mechanism. This is the analogy of form and emptiness—do you all understand?\n\n**Question:** Is the primordial attained only after essence, *qi*, and spirit are set aside?\n\n**Answer:** Wrong. You know only the Dao of purity and non-action, not the natural principle of yin and yang. Yin and yang do not stand alone.",

      "translated_text": "**Question:** What is the distinction between the prior and posterior Heaven?\n\n**Answer:** The posterior Heaven does not depart from the prior Heaven; the prior Heaven is itself the posterior Heaven—both are the same Heaven. Clouds obscure it, and worldly people see only the clouds and not the Heaven. I see the clouds as Heaven, so clouds are no obstruction.\n\n**Question:** What of cultivation through illusion-like practice?\n\n**Answer:** Cultivation through illusion-like practice cannot be attained lightly. Effect is itself merit—do you understand?\n\n**Question:** What is the true seed?\n\n**Answer:** When the mind is empty, without speaking of the true seed, that is the true seed. The Tathāgatagarbha encompasses boundless arising.\n\n**Question:** What does the \"bottom of the sea\" signify?\n\n**Answer:** The \"bottom of the sea\" is the profound depths of the human mind. When the sea dries up, its bottom is revealed; when a person dies, the mind remains unknown. Only through profound inquiry into the subtlest can this be grasped.\n\n**Further question:** What of the mind’s profound depths?\n\n**Answer:** A profound mind travels far. Only when one travels far does one find a dwelling within creation, and only with such a dwelling can one transform creation. Only then can one silently turn the mind of Heaven. The shallow cannot attain realization, so they mistake superficialities for the ultimate.\n\n*Far-traveling, the honored remains unmoved;*\n*Yet subtle principles are hard to unfold.*\n*Everywhere birdsong is heard—*\n*Walking deep among the mountain flowers.*\n\n**Question:** In the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, the Buddha questions the mind in seven places—how do we know which is the true mind?\n\n**Answer:** It is precisely this not-knowing. It is knowing without knowing, not unknowing without knowing.\n\n**Further question:** What is the ever-abiding true mind?\n\n**Answer:** When none of the vijñānas recognize it, that is the ever-abiding. Within non-recognition, recognition arises—that is wisdom. If discriminating thoughts arise and the mind scatters, one falls into the cycle of rebirth and becomes ordinary.\n\n**Question:** Where is the mind’s fixed abode?\n\n**Answer:** The mind has no fixed abode. If the mind had a fixed place to point to, it would be a deluded mind. Depart from delusion, and it is real.\n\nDo you now see me?\n\n**Further question:** If the mind cannot attain purity, what is to be done?\n\n**Answer:** How could the mind attain purity? Seek purity precisely within this impure state. When purity gives rise to impure appearances, that is when true purity attains purity.\n\n**Question:** What is the mind?\n\n**Answer:** What is not the mind? No-mind is the mind. With mind, there is no perfect penetration; without mind, one falls into vagueness. It is neither without mind nor with mind—between existence and non-existence, no-mind is the mind.\n\n**Further question:** What is the true mind?\n\n**Answer:** The true mind has no form; if it had form, it would belong to illusion and delusion. Yet the true mind is also not formless—it is not bound by form yet truly embodies all forms. Form, color, and inherent nature are the same for sages and worthies in their learning.\n\n**Further question:** Should the true mind be sought from the source of the mind?\n\n**Answer:** If the source is pure, heavenly principle manifests before you, and daily conduct does not obstruct the supreme Dao. If the source is impure, even if one has some insight, it is like a flickering lamp in the wind—how can that be the true constant?\n\nDo not mistake the true mind for a deluded mind. The so-called true mind is a mind of radiant purity, thus it can penetrate Heaven and Earth without the slightest falsity. It is not a mixture of copper and lead, nor is glimpsing the moon through clouds considered mastery. From where does this seeing-essence arise? Seek it, and you will not find it.\n\n*The Dao lies before your eyes, yet people do not recognize it—*\n*Vainly wielding the hoe, they scrutinize with care.*\n\n**Question:** What is true emptiness and wondrous existence?\n\n**Answer:** When the mind is empty yet not empty, that is true emptiness. When the mind exists yet does not exist, that is wondrous existence. Do not cling to one side—only then can you enter the Middle Way and lay the foundation for virtue.\n\n**Question:** My insight is shallow; I seek guidance to enter the mind’s profound depths.\n\n**Answer:** It is not shallow. At the gateway of the mind-ground, depth and shallowness are not uniform. The same words may appear deep to the profound, shallow to the shallow, and perfectly attuned to those with perfect insight—thus there is no fixed standard.\n\nYet the shallow striving for depth is what learners should diligently pursue. The profound is not separate from the present; it is only because perceptions differ that depth and shallowness are spoken of. One net can catch all—when you see your original nature in the present moment, where are the layers of depth and shallowness to be found, or the distinctions of high and low, thick and thin?\n\nThose who do not awaken find this hard to express. If you take my words as confirmation, you become one of overweening pride, tumbling headlong to the Western Paradise.",

and unaware.\nThus, I do not slight sentient beings,\nfor they differ from sages only in a single thought’s turn.\n\nQuestion: What is the primordial?\nAnswer: The mind is the primordial.\nThe primordial is spoken of in contrast to the postnatal—\na matter of duality.\nOnly when the mind transcends duality\ndoes it become truly constant,\nunobstructed in manifesting all forms,\nas the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* has already made clear.\n\nFurther question: When the mind transcends duality, is this not the meaning of \"wuji\" (the Ultimate)?\nAnswer: Wuji is true emptiness;\nyouji is wondrous principle.\nWuji is youji—\nthere is no wuji beyond youji.\n\"Encompassing heaven and earth without excess,\nshaping the myriad things without omission,\"\npivoting yin and yang,\neach form returning

primordial?\nFormlessness.\nYet formlessness does not stand alone—\nit is attested to by the formed.\nThe formed is the function of the formless;\nthe formless is the essence of the formed.\nThus, the

profusion—\nrare and marvelous, a precious encounter,\nyet it is the ancient Buddha’s Chan mechanism.\n\nQuestion: What method should one rely on in cultivation?\nAnswer: Rely on nothing.\nWithout dependence, see the true mind.\nThe true mind is not without dependence—\nit is walking atop Vairocana’s crown.\nOld Chan monks, accomplished monks,\nare indeed rare.\nIt all lies in one mind,\nwith no remaining dharma or unfulfilled meaning.\n\nQuestion: What is spiritual power?\nAnswer: Wondrously responding to the myriad things is called \"spirit\";\nbeing nowhere yet nowhere absent is called \"power.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the reward body?\nAnswer: The reward body has no reward—\nit is merely a provisional name,\nmeaning perfection.\nIf there were truly a reward body,\nit would be dualistic seeing.\nTwo yet not one—\none would also not be one.\nThis is the true One, the non-dual illumination of quiescence.\n\nFurther question: What is the dharma body?\nAnswer: The dharma body\nis the principle that gathers and accumulates all dharmas,\nyet cannot be grasped in words.\n\nQuestion: Does the mind have a name?\nAnswer: The mind has no name—\neven the Dao is but a provisional name.\nThe great Dao transcends images, numbers, and names—\nhow could it be named?\n\nQuestion: What is birth and death?\nAnswer: Distinguishing between provisional and transformed birth and death\nstill leaves birth and death.\nIf one does not distinguish between provisional and transformed,\nthe cycle of rebirth is brief and empty.\nNo one asks about emptiness—\nI speak of my own

Shatter this den of thieves, and you may stride straight upward to the Jasper Heaven. All other practices of the flesh are unnecessary. In this Dao, the work of the flesh is already encompassed: master one, and all are mastered; mountains, rivers, and the great earth are none other than this body. What use is there in fussing over the filth of a mere heart, liver, or five viscera?\n\nToday I, too, resolve to enlighten. If only your karmic conditions and capacities can bear it, you shall personally witness and verify—sweeping aside all heterodox and misguided paths. What is the Great Dao? What are nature and life? Why speak of such things at all?\n\nAs for the four modes of deportment, follow the precepts and maintain practice—there are countless topics for inquiry. Let me offer one instance of causation: How is it that the ox eats grass, and the grass eats the ox? This is the nonduality of being and nonbeing. How does one distinguish movement and stillness? How does one relinquish both form and emptiness, and after relinquishing, is there still form and emptiness? Investigate.”",

      "translated_text": "“Pure karma differs from defiled karma—when spoken of, both ordinary and sage are cast aside. In the vast, empty radiance of the Great Light Heaven, living immortals manifest.”\n\n“Man’s birth begins with qi embraced in the turbid mire, forming his substance. By the time he awakens, yin and yang have already parted. Cravings and worldly splendor, fortune and misfortune, regret and shame—all swirl about, yet he remains oblivious. Once yin and yang decisively separate, the primordial qi cannot be restored, and death alone follows. This qi is the qi of Heaven and Earth, not something you or I may claim as our own; within it lies principle. The good are rewarded with good, the evil with evil. Those who fall into evil and drift toward alien forms—where their po souls return, where their hun souls scatter, the shallowness of their resonance, the worth of their encounters—all differ in kind. Yet the great pattern remains: millet does not grow from sorghum, the phoenix does not nurse a foal. Each follows its own course; it all depends on where a person directs his steps.”\n\n“Are the natures of men—whether dull or wise—innately different in what they are endowed with? The unworthy fall short, while the wise exceed—yet herein lies the clarity of the Middle Way. The worthy stand far apart from the foolish, yet unbeknownst to them, before the worthy ascend, they are in truth no better than the foolish. Let each reflect on this for himself.”\n\n“Since I first established this teaching, my approach has varied, high and low, never uniform. I observe only whether a person is sincere and faithful, for their karmic resonance differs, and their aspirations are not the same. My coming here is no small matter—hurriedly I have traversed the four seas and nine provinces, precisely to offer today a ladder and a boat. Know that my Way is upright, radiant, and great, not the lurking of demons and specters. I refute heterodox teachings, rectify human hearts, and unite all in harmonious, virtuous qi. I do not confine people like birds in a cage, nor do I promote misguided paths, withered meditation, ascetic austerities, or the neglect of proper duties to feign superiority. The Great Dao is majestic, the sun and moon ever in motion—all are the supreme Way, now made manifest. Even if adorned with jeweled ornaments, embellishing the world, it is not extravagance when the time calls for it. Even with but a single incense burner and a few disciples, sincere and reverent, it is not frugality—abundance or restraint must suit the moment, harmonized to the mean. You must broaden your vision and not cling to the present. Noble men, vast as a thousand-zhang canopy, must shine forth.”\n\n“An ancient buddha reveals the compassionate ferry, saving the busy world of heaven and earth. All phenomena observed without duality—with every thought, the mind speaks of blossoms and gold. In the still night, the hammer’s sound echoes from an ancient temple; wind, flowers, snow, and moon—all rise as incense in one burner.”\n\n“My Dao is vast and profound, not like those with the vision of a valley, who see only the eye’s end as immortality, cut themselves off from others, and flee the world to dwell in mountain caves, believing themselves content. Idle hands at leisure, savoring the rewards of heaven and earth—wind, flowers, snow, and moon—discoursing on mysteries, wandering the islands of Penglai, never lacking immortals. My Way is not like this. I act on Heaven’s behalf to transform, universally delivering the worthy and the foolish alike to the sacred fruit of supreme goodness—this is no narrow stream or minor path. Therefore, you must redouble your reverence and caution, riding this heavenly grace to gain true benefit. Though the depth of benefit may vary, each receives according to their capacity and karma, all perfectly complete.”\n\n“This humble one fully embodies the pulse of the Dao, here to manifest its luminous efficacy, that later generations and those who uphold the teaching may know: my Way is one of assisting in the transformation and nurturing of all things, not self-liberation alone. Those of the heterodox paths who now follow my teaching must each vow and set their minds to it. Perfecting oneself and perfecting others—perfecting others is precisely how one perfects oneself; one cannot perfect oneself without perfecting others.”\n\n“All of you, quiet your minds and heed my words: the nine bends of the Yellow River, the perilous passes of heaven—all are but manifestations of the human heart. The great earth itself is fundamentally impartial, level and vast. Cross the rivers and weirs with ease, for this humble one’s transformative traces are manifest across the nine provinces. I grasp the peaks of heaven and earth, the sun and moon; the green-tipped sword hangs at my shoulder. I have searched the world for good and evil—how many sons and grandsons shift responsibility, while aged parents feel themselves a burden? Brothers and kin harbor resentment, each preserving a facade, unaware of their original purity. They entangle themselves in chaos, never knowing: if your fate is to be pure, you are born pure. If your fate is not to be pure, forcibly pruning branches and leaves only leads to rebirth, leaving behind many karmic debts, adding yet another case to settle—still the karmic conditions remain unresolved, and afflictions multiply.”\n\n“All are but flesh-eyed mortals, seeking only immediate gratification, heedless of Heaven’s principle, clear and inescapable. How many descendants flourish without first cultivating filial piety and brotherly harmony? My descent into the mortal realm has been long, yet all I do is urge people to accept their fate. Accept your fate, and when your fate is fulfilled, even the impure will attain purity—a gentle, harmonious breeze. Invisibly, spirits and auspicious deities protect and surround you, and over time, the untransformed becomes qi—yet none know why. Fortune flows from every side, disasters vanish, blessings increase. Otherwise, what seems a clever scheme in the moment only darkens the atmosphere, making qi difficult to transform—yet none know why. Day by day, obstacles arise, spirit wanes, and ghosts seize their po souls. Their wisdom falls short of others’, every step misdirected, unaware of their own transgressions, accumulating by degrees. They blame Heaven for lacking principle, others for lacking compassion! Such foolish and wicked souls are truly pitiable, yet deserving of scorn.”\n\n“Thus I descend to the world to universally save sentient beings, guiding them toward good fruits. The good are rewarded with good, the evil with evil—Heaven’s gaze is luminous, not a thread amiss. Great good brings great fruit; small good brings small fruit. Each reaps their own fruit—none know why it is so, yet so it is. Heed these words with reverence!”",

      "translated_text": "“To ever keep this before one’s eyes, to brightly manifest lofty virtue—sage and worthy learning differs not from profound Chan. Yet世人 fail to discern the distinctions and commonalities of the Three Teachings, endlessly debating, truly raving in drunken dreams, galloping past flowers to laughter’s end! Those who turn their minds to this Dao, however, fall prey to the flaw of loving stillness and hating movement, each and all unaware of how they forcibly sever karmic entanglements, still not resolving their conditions. Some cut themselves off from others and flee the world, plunging deep into mountain forests—yet there, tigers and leopards, wolves and jackals, mountain spirits and demons, violent thunder and fierce winds make the heart tremble and the spirit quake! Moreover, with bodies of flesh and blood, clothing and food must be supplied, ever dependent on others; the slightest misstep in adjustment brings cold and heat, damp and rain, swiftly turning to suffering, illness, and pain. At such times, failing to awaken, they stray onto side paths, obscuring the learning of the Dao, gaining nothing, only harming themselves. Others, aspiring to mountain forests, unwilling to engage with worldly affairs in action or concealment, blindly pursue eccentric and bizarre conduct to set themselves apart from the vulgar, unaware that they waste time and neglect duties, leading to deficiencies in affairs, daily decline of spirit, and no insight into the Dao. Unaware of their own missteps, they stray onto side paths, then claim that doing good brings no prosperity, that the Dao cannot be learned—such wild talk truly merits great laughter! Added to this, heterodox teachers and misleading friends disorder the ancestral lineage of the Dao, deviating by a hair’s breadth a thousand miles, fishing for fame and praise, truly harming our Dao.\n\nAlas! Today, two or three of you rouse your aspirations upward, delving into subtleties and penetrating mysteries, becoming treasures of my gate. Yet the flaws in learning the Dao, leading to the decline of human affairs, all stem from entering side gates. In the end, the deep intentions that arise in the heart are deeply pitiable. If one could cultivate within human affairs, it would surpass mountain forests. The transmission of my Dao has always been cultivation within human affairs, not favoring deep mountains or ghostly caves, fleeing the world and cutting off from others to become self-liberated hermits.”\n\n“That I attain the same enduring vastness as Heaven and Earth is because I embody Heaven and Earth’s heart of cherishing life. If you all can vow to act according to your strength and talents, without harm to yourselves and with benefit to others—though benefiting others cannot but entail some harm to oneself—yet there is no principle of complete harm. If completely harmed, what others gain they cannot bear to receive. Unless it is a matter of great righteousness or repayment of past karmic debts, it is unnecessary. Simply strive to act in accord with the times, ensuring appropriateness and avoiding fault, transforming misfortune into fortune—this is a lucky star, this is a great disciple who spreads transformation in my gate. In the unseen future, you will receive retribution, grasping the handle of human fortune and misfortune, second only to me. My intent is not reckless bestowal; you must skillfully comprehend that even a single word or deed benefiting others is an aspect of spreading transformation.”\n\n“For people, idle moments fill most days, while busy times are few. Like you all here, focused on this one matter—once past it, ten thousand threads and a thousand ends arise. Yet in truth, walking, standing, sitting, lying—all are one matter; people merely make themselves busy. Thus I previously said: simply not being deluded in the present moment keeps the mind from scattering and the intent from straying. Saving much effort, treading firmly on the ground, adapting to circumstances, neither indulging in idle thoughts nor ‘learning the Dao’—this itself is the great Dao. With long practice, spirit congeals and qi gathers, merging seamlessly; the power of spirit flows continuously, only then dissolving demonic obstacles, escaping the cage, ascending the sky, step by step reverently.”\n\n“Human sentiments wax and wane, worldly affairs shift and change, quite difficult to foresee—none are fixed.”",

If you seek only the comfort of this body, that is but a trifling art of nurturing life, something both heaven and earth and humankind despise—what is called the lazy path. How can this be called learning? How can it be called the Dao? The transformative power of the Dao is vast, luminous, and boundless; it flows unimpeded in every time and place. Its nurturing work is such that the Dao gives rise to the Dao, and from it all transformations emerge.*\n\n*Yet those who cultivate the Dao strive to flee the dust and abandon the worldly, unaware that one must harmonize with its light and merge with its dust—what does this mean? Heaven remains heaven, earth remains earth, and humankind remains humankind; none depart from the human realm—how then can one distance oneself from others? Moreover, the Dao does not stand apart from humankind. In daily life and ordinary conduct, nothing lies outside the Dao. The Dao resides in heaven and earth, becoming heaven and earth; the Dao resides in humankind, becoming humankind. By preserving the spirit and understanding transformation, how can the Dao be distant from humankind?\"*\n\nSomeone asked: *\"People differ in sharpness and dullness, and teachings vary in their expressions. Those of bright and vigorous nature, whose fundamental essence shines forth—whose clarity suffices to perceive the subtle workings and whose vigor suffices to reach decisive action—naturally find their effort converging on simplicity. They may proceed directly to the Buddha’s path, leaping straight into the realm of Thus-Come. But if one’s fundamental essence is obscured, it is because the work of attaining emptiness remains incomplete. Attaining emptiness is the accumulation of rightness. Rightness means fitting precisely to what is appropriate. Fitting precisely to what is appropriate is the exact point of the human heart—is this not the mean?\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"Even in a heart obscured by dullness, there is the light of awakening. The difference lies only in whether knowledge comes through struggle or ease. Only through illumination can one attain emptiness. When one reaches the exact point, there is no longer any contrivance.\"*\n\n*\"Verbal teachings, too, may be incomplete or imperfect, for they are but medicine applied to illness. If all scriptures and canons were bound to a single principle, one book would suffice—why then so many pages of endless repetition? Some teachings are addressed to great bodhisattvas, some point the way, some offer expedient means for the ignorant, and some are shared wisdom for the worthy. The* Daodejing *of the Most High, a work of celestial spontaneity and pristine return to the origin, has endured through the ages unscathed. It is the primordial qi of Great Harmony. The Great Dao is thereby made manifest, the* Heart Sutra *thereby established as its foundation, serving as a bridge for all generations. Though its meaning is plain on the surface, its hidden profundities are not ordinary. The various commentaries only scratch the surface—each sees what their virtue or wisdom allows. The common people use it daily yet remain unaware, and thus the Dao of the noble person is rare indeed.\"*\n\n*\"A person may do good or evil, may begin with good and turn to evil, or begin with evil and turn to good—there is no fixed judgment.
