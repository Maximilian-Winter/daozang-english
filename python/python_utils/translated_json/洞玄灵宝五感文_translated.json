One fascicle.\nSource of the base text: *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n**The Wondrous Treasure Scripture of Five Stirrings of the Heart**\nCompiled by Lu Xiujing\n\nThese Five Stirrings of the Heart are the methods by which Daoists observe the Six Fasts, all drawn from the great scriptures of the Three Caverns. They are most revered and profound, and must not be treated with defilement or disrespect. Those who read them must first wash their hands and place them upon a clean cloth. Those who keep them must store them in a proper vessel and never treat them lightly. Those who treat them lightly will surely incur heavenly calamity.\n\nThe Supreme Dao is pure and void, its laws simple and unadorned, serene and without action—this is its essence. Yet the world is filled with falsity and vanity; few can embody and practice it. Instead, they vie for lofty reputations and indulge in excess, placing faith in the deceptive and the false. They cling to perverse spirits, falsely claiming orthodoxy. Noble and base alike follow this path, lost in long slumber, never awakening to discernment. Thus, they endanger the divine vessel above and ruin the common people below, destroying themselves and their states, yet still failing to take heed.\n\nEven worse, they muddy the true *qi*, stain the pure and real, and defile the Great Dao—how grievous this is! Born in this degenerate age, I have witnessed the collapse of the teachings’ framework. All rush toward that path, while I alone secretly guard this one. The Dao diminishes day by day, and I return to the root, nourishing the source. I renounce the fame of fragrance and purity, opening my heart to the filth of dust and grime. I beg to be spared the axe of contention, seeking only to preserve what is useless and be content.\n\nIn leisure and tranquility, I pass the days in freedom. Studying the scriptures and refining their principles, I cultivate merit and virtue at times. In the winter of the *guisi* year, I led my disciples to establish the Three Primes Fast of Mud and Ashes. The precepts were strict, and for months on end, we endured frost and dew, our feet frozen and heads muddied. Amidst cold rain, our clothes were soaked; biting winds and piercing cold assailed our flesh. Yet we endured hardship to follow the Dao, never daring to falter.\n\nFearing that our frail bodies might grow weary, I spoke of the Five Stirrings to encourage and console. I also systematized the various fasts, marking their categories and distinctions, and roughly elucidated their differences—not out of pride or boasting. May the dozens of like-minded companions and faithful scholars who share this devotion take heed!\n\nIf one observes the Fast of Mud and Ashes without the heart of the Five Stirrings, they will fail to grasp my intent. First, it wastes incense in vain; second, it becomes mere deception; third, it treats the precepts with disrespect; fourth, it dishonors the master’s teachings; and fifth, it invites further sin and punishment.\n\n**First Stirring:** Reflect on how parents gave me life and nurtured me, raising and caring for me. They carried me in their arms, fed me with their own mouths, and tended to me with labor and hardship, their bodies worn and their hearts weary. If I fell ill, they worried and grieved for me, their hearts burning as if scorched. Day and night, they trembled with fear, losing sleep and forgetting meals. Their sorrow and distress deepened, their tears flowing like streams. They prayed for my growth and well-being, that I might thrive as I do now. Such boundless kindness cannot be measured. I vow to repay it before the boundless heavens.\n\n**Second Stirring:** Reflect on how parents arranged my coming-of-age rites, my marriage, and my inheritance. They accumulated wealth and property, desiring only my prosperity. Unaware of their own excess, they competed with others, provoking resentment and blame. Their transgressions grew, sometimes to the point of disgrace, offending heaven and earth, harming others, or violating the laws of the state and the unseen statutes of the netherworld. Punishments fell upon them, even endangering their lives—all because of me, bringing such suffering upon them.\n\nNow, they have fallen into the Three Wretched Realms, enduring countless torments: walking upon sword trees, cast into mountains of blades, treading upon scorching fires and boiling cauldrons, or plunged into the freezing darkness of eternal night. They may be suspended beneath the lashes of the flogging spirits, enduring a thousand pains and ten thousand sorrows, unbearable to endure. Their grief and anguish are unceasing, each moment a torment. They long for escape but have no means to save themselves.\n\nRecalling this, my heart shatters, my liver and mind dissolve in chaos. My limbs tremble, my form and soul lose their place. Unconsciously, I prostrate myself in the mud and ashes, begging for mercy.\n\n**Third Stirring:** Reflect on how, beneath the vast heavens, all people—noble and base, men and women—receive human form. The burdens of body and speech are the heaviest of mortal life. We eat the five flavors and wear the five colors. Once sated and warm, we no longer restrain ourselves, indulging in luxury and extravagance, following every desire and whim. We pursue and strive without end, never satisfied, harming our spirits and bodies without awareness.\n\nWhen our *qi* and life fade, our forms decay and rot—what use then are all the things we once clung to? Our lonely souls depart, suffering myriad torments. Truly, this darkness is beyond the world’s understanding. Yet our wealth scatters, becoming a future calamity. It breeds deceit and theft, inciting strife among descendants. The strong seize more, the weak gain little, and disputes over gain and loss breed resentment. Some bring lawsuits before officials and are punished; others appeal to spirits and ghosts, suffering unseen misfortune.\n\nEven blood kin turn against one another, building schemes and rivalries. The weight of kinship is cast aside like dust, and the love of siblings becomes a contest for petty gains. Families are destroyed, their ruin born of greed and excess. All things pass away, sinking into oblivion together. None awaken, and even those who do cannot let go. The past was ever thus, and the future will be the same. This has become the norm, and they embrace it without regret.\n\nI recognize this folly and thus turn away from the world, abandoning my six relations, forsaking glory and burdens, seeking the Dao and the path to life. Through diligent study, I save myself, striving to repay my parents’ lifelong kindness. Now, having obtained the divine elixir to save the drowning, I ascend this Dharma bridge to cross to the other shore. Overcome with grief and joy, my five emotions soar, my heart and spirit race, forgetting my four limbs. Unaware, I abandon myself, surrendering to the Three Treasures. I exhaust my resources, offering them for the Dharma’s use, fearing only that it may not be enough, with no hesitation or regret.\n\nMay my parents ascend to the Hall of Blessings, forever spared the Eight Difficulties, free from sorrow and distress. May this humble sincerity serve as my offering.\n\nI offer my fourfold gratitude to the Most High, the Venerable, the Great Sage Perfected Ones, who have unfolded this great transformation, revealed these wondrous methods, rescued beings from the Three Wretched Realms, and delivered those in the Five Paths. For billions of ancestors across kalpas, their accumulated karmic retributions dissolve in a single day; suffering souls and wandering spirits ascend to the Hall of Blessings, and through this, their clans and lineages all receive blessings and grace.\n\nHaving attained the Dao myself, my descendants shall inherit fortune—this kindness is rare, appearing but once in ten thousand kalpas. Now that I have encountered it, I devote my life to its practice, pouring out my heart and exhausting my devotion, never slackening.\n\nFivefold gratitude arises for the fortune I have gained, for this opportunity has its cause: through this unfolding and deliverance, I have been enabled to witness it. My teacher’s kindness, which I revere without limit, surpasses even heaven and earth.\n\nThus, on the days I perform the Dao rituals, I offer earnest prayers, hoping that even the slightest merit may repay this benevolence and virtue. Though my body is weary and my strength spent, I dare not refuse. Having received this Dharma, my awe and joy are boundless—like a greedy man stumbling upon a trove of gold and jade, unseen by others, known only to me. I prostrate myself in silence, exerting all my strength to excavate it, day after day, month after month, never tiring. I fear only that the treasure may be exhausted, never minding the labor. Bearing frost and snow upon my back, wading through water and treading on ice, my body numbed to the bone, I feel no cold; traversing rugged paths and sharp rocks, I deem no hardship too great. My heart is joyful, my spirit content—nothing can delude me.\n\nAll the fasting and Dharma rites...\n\nThe Dao takes fasting and precepts as the root of establishing virtue and the gateway to seeking truth. Those who study the Dao in pursuit of immortality, as well as households that pray for blessings and seek prosperity, cannot do without them. Since individuals differ in clarity and obscurity of understanding, their enlightenment varies in sharpness and dullness. As their capacities differ in strength and weakness, so too do their commitments in depth and shallowness. Thus, the sages graded them by refinement and coarseness, distinguishing their paths step by step. In broad terms, there are nine ranks, each with its own methods—altogether twelve forms of fasting.\n\nThe first is the *Dongzhen Shangqing* fast, which has two methods. The first method: severing ties with the mundane and forsaking companionship. Abandoning the company of friends, having no wife or servants, one dwells in solitude, serene and utterly still, with only one’s shadow for company. Taking non-action as one’s practice, one remains upright and tranquil, engaging in no activity. Embracing embryonic breathing and inward contemplation, the heart becomes the mechanism of spirit. *Jivei* (寂胃): the stomach, which takes receiving food as its function, now void of breath and abstaining from food, becomes utterly still and settled. *Xushen* (虚申): the fast sets the ear as its limit, with food taken at the *shen* hour; now, with no food consumed, this hour passes in emptiness. *Mianshen* (眠神): the spirit, which governs the external and thrives on restlessness, now having no affairs to attend to, retreats inward in tranquil repose—hence it is called \"sleeping.\" *Jingqi* (静炁): *Qi* is the transformation of the body and the chariot of the spirit. When the spirit stirs, *qi* scatters; now, with the spirit withdrawn inward, *qi* becomes still and the body tranquil. *Yixing wangti* (遗形忘体): the body, existing in dependence, engages with things and is thus burdened by them—this burden cannot be forgotten. Now, with no pressing hunger or cold within and no entanglements without, one becomes utterly detached and indifferent, unaware even of the whereabouts of the four elements. Thus, one merges with the Dao. The Dao’s essence is emptiness and nothingness; the self’s existence creates separation. Now, having forgotten the self, one achieves mystical union.\n\nThe second method: *Guying yihuo* (孤影夷豁). It is largely the same as the above, but integrates body and spirit, with differences in the recitation of scriptures.\n\nThe second is the *Dongxuan Lingbao* fast, which has nine methods, taking action as its foundation. These involve grand rituals with numerous participants, where every gesture and gaze follows rhythm, every advance and retreat adheres to measure. The monthly fasts are solemn, their standards resplendent, their Dharma sounds resonant, opening the way for transformation and guiding all beings. Those who seek the oars hear, and those who come to witness see—its vastness and grandeur defy full description.\n\nThe first method: the *Jinlu* fast. It harmonizes yin and yang and delivers the nation from disorder. The ritual is conducted at a *lu di xuantan* (露地玄坛), thirty-two feet in width. The altar is enclosed on four sides and opened on four for use, with a single gate. Within the altar, a secondary altar is erected, twenty-four feet in width, with openings at the four corners above. Below, ten gates are established, each with an inscribed plaque. At the center of the altar, a long lamp nine feet in height is placed, with nine flames atop it. Around the altar’s four sides, colored lamps are arranged, totaling thirty-six. Outside the altar, hundreds or thousands of lamps may be lit, depending on the participants. The celestial texts of the five directions are inscribed and placed on five tables, each bearing five golden dragons weighing one tael each to press down upon the texts. Above, incense and fire are offered, and the texts are written on five-colored silk, with lengths corresponding to each direction, totaling thirty-six *pi*. The assembled practitioners perform the Dao for nine days in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, five in winter, and twelve in the months of the four seasons, or six days in a single month. Upon completing the rites for the ten directions, the celestial texts are burned, the dragons and silks scattered as merit.\n\nThe second method: the *Huanglu* fast. Conducted for fellow practitioners to eradicate the roots of sin for nine generations of ancestors. The ritual also involves erecting an altar, with dimensions, gates, and doors identical to the *Jinlu* fast, but with ten lamps arranged around the altar’s four sides, ten gates, three incense fires, and offerings of silk for the ten directions. For commoners, the silk measures 136 feet; for nobles, the length varies by rank; and for the Son of Heaven, the measure is by *pi*. Ten golden dragons, each weighing one tael, are used, with gold of high, medium, and low quality to distinguish noble and base. The rites involve bowing and offering thanks to the twenty directions, with the number of days following the *Jinlu* fast’s seasonal regulations. Upon completion, the dragons are cast into water or buried in mountains, and the remaining silks are scattered as merit.\n\nThe third method: the *Mingzhen* fast. Practitioners deliver the souls of their countless ancestors from the Nine Dark Realms. The ritual is also conducted in the open, with a long lamp lit, its nine flames arranged as in the *Jinlu* fast, but without the altar’s gates and doors. Incense and lamps are offered, and the Dao is performed for a day and a night, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions in six periods.\n\nThe fourth method: the *Sanyuan* fast. Practitioners perform this three times a year to atone for sins committed in study and transgressions. The ritual takes place on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months. Each day, one bathes and performs the Dao three times, bowing and offering thanks to the twenty-one directions within the fasting hall.\n\nThe fifth method: the *Bajie* fast. Practitioners perform this eight times a year to atone for the sins of the seven generations of ancestors and their own past and present transgressions. On the eight solar terms, the Dao is performed in six periods within the fasting hall, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions.\n\nThe sixth method: the *Ziran* fast. A universal deliverance, it cultivates the self within and saves beings without. It dispels calamities and prays for blessings, adapting to one’s needs. The ritual may involve a group or a single practitioner, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions. It may last one day, three days, a hundred days, or a thousand days, with three or six periods.\n\nThe seventh method: the *Dongshen Sanhuang* fast. It values purity and simplicity, with solitude as its companion. One severs worldly ties to await the numinous, bathing in the water of mysterious clouds, burning incense of the supreme emperor, lighting candles of dark liquid, and ingesting the *Shangyuan* fragrant pill. Various renowned incenses are blended in precise measures, steamed and refined into fragrant beads strung with green silk, dried in the sun. Fragrant oils are also prepared from these incenses, used for bathing and made into pills for ingestion, all following specific regulations. Thirty-six oil lamps are lit, and thirty-six incense burners are arranged in sequence, tended day and night without cease. The fast may last a hundred days or forty days, with focused devotion, tending lamps and incense, reciting pure and wondrous invocations of thirty-two words.\n\nTo summon spirits, invoke them solely through the imperial scriptures; whatever is summoned or inquired, whether seeking immortality or life, depends on one’s intent. The eightfold method is the Fast of the Great One, with reverence and solemnity as its foundation. All participants must purify themselves in unison, rouse their resolve, and act with devotion, adhering strictly to the Dao without mingling with heterodox teachings. In prostration, bowing, and yielding, they humble themselves like a chime stone, fulfilling their duty to the utmost.\n\nThe ninth method is the Fast of Instruction, where simplicity and purity are prized. The libationer and the registered disciples share all necessities, enduring hardship without complaint. When hunger strikes, they eat only vegetables, save for those dedicated to the Lord, which they may not consume. After the midday meal, they do not let water pass their teeth, contemplating the scriptures and meditating on the Dao without pause, even for a moment.\n\nIt is also said: The Fast of the Three Origins through Fire and Ash, where austerity is the measure of merit. It absolves the boundless sins of one’s ancestors across countless kalpas, as well as the innumerable transgressions of one’s own family, delivering them from suffering and rescuing others from peril. Its merit is profound beyond measure. The ritual is performed on open ground, where an altar is erected with barriers. All participants, bound by shared qi, are worthy ones who smear their foreheads with yellow mud, let their hair loose, and bind themselves to the barriers with hands tied behind their backs. They hold jade in their mouths, prostrate themselves face-down upon the earth, legs spread three feet apart, and kowtow in repentance. By day, they face west at three intervals; by night, they face north at three intervals.\n\nThe fast consists of three interconnected Origins—Upper, Middle, and Lower—each lasting twelve days, totaling thirty-six days. Upon completing the Lower Origin, they advance to the Middle Origin for twelve days, adding three additional prostrations before concluding. After the Middle Origin, they proceed to the Upper Origin for twelve days, adding five prostrations before concluding. For the conclusion, they face one of the four cardinal directions or four corners, intensifying their austerities.\n\nThe term \"Three Origins\" signifies the beginning of cycles. A year has twelve months and three hundred sixty days; ten days form a decade, and a month has three decades—Upper, Middle, and Lower. Twelve months comprise thirty-six decades, which are divided into three Origins, each spanning twelve days, completing one cycle.\n\nHere ends the *Wondrous Scripture of the Five Responses of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.",

      "translated_text": "I offer my fourfold gratitude to the Most High, the Venerable, the Great Sage Perfected Ones, who have unfolded this great transformation, revealed these wondrous methods, rescued beings from the Three Wretched Realms, and delivered those in the Five Paths. For billions of ancestors across kalpas, their accumulated karmic retributions dissolve in a single day; suffering souls and wandering spirits ascend to the Hall of Blessings, and through this, their clans and lineages all receive blessings and grace.\n\nHaving attained the Dao myself, my descendants shall inherit fortune—this kindness is rare, appearing but once in ten thousand kalpas. Now that I have encountered it, I devote my life to its practice, pouring out my heart and exhausting my devotion, never slackening.\n\nFivefold gratitude arises for the fortune I have gained, for this opportunity has its cause: through this unfolding and deliverance, I have been enabled to witness it. My teacher’s kindness, which I revere without limit, surpasses even heaven and earth.\n\nThus, on the days I perform the Dao rituals, I offer earnest prayers, hoping that even the slightest merit may repay this benevolence and virtue. Though my body is weary and my strength spent, I dare not refuse. Having received this Dharma, my awe and joy are boundless—like a greedy man stumbling upon a trove of gold and jade, unseen by others, known only to me. I prostrate myself in silence, exerting all my strength to excavate it, day after day, month after month, never tiring. I fear only that the treasure may be exhausted, never minding the labor. Bearing frost and snow upon my back, wading through water and treading on ice, my body numbed to the bone, I feel no cold; traversing rugged paths and sharp rocks, I deem no hardship too great. My heart is joyful, my spirit content—nothing can delude me.\n\nAll the fasting and Dharma rites...",

      "translated_text": "The Dao takes fasting and precepts as the root of establishing virtue and the gateway to seeking truth. Those who study the Dao in pursuit of immortality, as well as households that pray for blessings and seek prosperity, cannot do without them. Since individuals differ in clarity and obscurity of understanding, their enlightenment varies in sharpness and dullness. As their capacities differ in strength and weakness, so too do their commitments in depth and shallowness. Thus, the sages graded them by refinement and coarseness, distinguishing their paths step by step. In broad terms, there are nine ranks, each with its own methods—altogether twelve forms of fasting.\n\nThe first is the *Dongzhen Shangqing* fast, which has two methods. The first method: severing ties with the mundane and forsaking companionship. Abandoning the company of friends, having no wife or servants, one dwells in solitude, serene and utterly still, with only one’s shadow for company. Taking non-action as one’s practice, one remains upright and tranquil, engaging in no activity. Embracing embryonic breathing and inward contemplation, the heart becomes the mechanism of spirit. *Jivei* (寂胃): the stomach, which takes receiving food as its function, now void of breath and abstaining from food, becomes utterly still and settled. *Xushen* (虚申): the fast sets the ear as its limit, with food taken at the *shen* hour; now, with no food consumed, this hour passes in emptiness. *Mianshen* (眠神): the spirit, which governs the external and thrives on restlessness, now having no affairs to attend to, retreats inward in tranquil repose—hence it is called \"sleeping.\" *Jingqi* (静炁): *Qi* is the transformation of the body and the chariot of the spirit. When the spirit stirs, *qi* scatters; now, with the spirit withdrawn inward, *qi* becomes still and the body tranquil. *Yixing wangti* (遗形忘体): the body, existing in dependence, engages with things and is thus burdened by them—this burden cannot be forgotten. Now, with no pressing hunger or cold within and no entanglements without, one becomes utterly detached and indifferent, unaware even of the whereabouts of the four elements. Thus, one merges with the Dao. The Dao’s essence is emptiness and nothingness; the self’s existence creates separation. Now, having forgotten the self, one achieves mystical union.\n\nThe second method: *Guying yihuo* (孤影夷豁). It is largely the same as the above, but integrates body and spirit, with differences in the recitation of scriptures.\n\nThe second is the *Dongxuan Lingbao* fast, which has nine methods, taking action as its foundation. These involve grand rituals with numerous participants, where every gesture and gaze follows rhythm, every advance and retreat adheres to measure. The monthly fasts are solemn, their standards resplendent, their Dharma sounds resonant, opening the way for transformation and guiding all beings. Those who seek the oars hear, and those who come to witness see—its vastness and grandeur defy full description.\n\nThe first method: the *Jinlu* fast. It harmonizes yin and yang and delivers the nation from disorder. The ritual is conducted at a *lu di xuantan* (露地玄坛), thirty-two feet in width. The altar is enclosed on four sides and opened on four for use, with a single gate. Within the altar, a secondary altar is erected, twenty-four feet in width, with openings at the four corners above. Below, ten gates are established, each with an inscribed plaque. At the center of the altar, a long lamp nine feet in height is placed, with nine flames atop it. Around the altar’s four sides, colored lamps are arranged, totaling thirty-six. Outside the altar, hundreds or thousands of lamps may be lit, depending on the participants. The celestial texts of the five directions are inscribed and placed on five tables, each bearing five golden dragons weighing one tael each to press down upon the texts. Above, incense and fire are offered, and the texts are written on five-colored silk, with lengths corresponding to each direction, totaling thirty-six *pi*. The assembled practitioners perform the Dao for nine days in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, five in winter, and twelve in the months of the four seasons, or six days in a single month. Upon completing the rites for the ten directions, the celestial texts are burned, the dragons and silks scattered as merit.\n\nThe second method: the *Huanglu* fast. Conducted for fellow practitioners to eradicate the roots of sin for nine generations of ancestors. The ritual also involves erecting an altar, with dimensions, gates, and doors identical to the *Jinlu* fast, but with ten lamps arranged around the altar’s four sides, ten gates, three incense fires, and offerings of silk for the ten directions. For commoners, the silk measures 136 feet; for nobles, the length varies by rank; and for the Son of Heaven, the measure is by *pi*. Ten golden dragons, each weighing one tael, are used, with gold of high, medium, and low quality to distinguish noble and base. The rites involve bowing and offering thanks to the twenty directions, with the number of days following the *Jinlu* fast’s seasonal regulations. Upon completion, the dragons are cast into water or buried in mountains, and the remaining silks are scattered as merit.\n\nThe third method: the *Mingzhen* fast. Practitioners deliver the souls of their countless ancestors from the Nine Dark Realms. The ritual is also conducted in the open, with a long lamp lit, its nine flames arranged as in the *Jinlu* fast, but without the altar’s gates and doors. Incense and lamps are offered, and the Dao is performed for a day and a night, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions in six periods.\n\nThe fourth method: the *Sanyuan* fast. Practitioners perform this three times a year to atone for sins committed in study and transgressions. The ritual takes place on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months. Each day, one bathes and performs the Dao three times, bowing and offering thanks to the twenty-one directions within the fasting hall.\n\nThe fifth method: the *Bajie* fast. Practitioners perform this eight times a year to atone for the sins of the seven generations of ancestors and their own past and present transgressions. On the eight solar terms, the Dao is performed in six periods within the fasting hall, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions.\n\nThe sixth method: the *Ziran* fast. A universal deliverance, it cultivates the self within and saves beings without. It dispels calamities and prays for blessings, adapting to one’s needs. The ritual may involve a group or a single practitioner, with bows and thanks given to the ten directions. It may last one day, three days, a hundred days, or a thousand days, with three or six periods.\n\nThe seventh method: the *Dongshen Sanhuang* fast. It values purity and simplicity, with solitude as its companion. One severs worldly ties to await the numinous, bathing in the water of mysterious clouds, burning incense of the supreme emperor, lighting candles of dark liquid, and ingesting the *Shangyuan* fragrant pill. Various renowned incenses are blended in precise measures, steamed and refined into fragrant beads strung with green silk, dried in the sun. Fragrant oils are also prepared from these incenses, used for bathing and made into pills for ingestion, all following specific regulations. Thirty-six oil lamps are lit, and thirty-six incense burners are arranged in sequence, tended day and night without cease. The fast may last a hundred days or forty days, with focused devotion, tending lamps and incense, reciting pure and wondrous invocations of thirty-two words.",

      "translated_text": "To summon spirits, invoke them solely through the imperial scriptures; whatever is summoned or inquired, whether seeking immortality or life, depends on one’s intent. The eightfold method is the Fast of the Great One, with reverence and solemnity as its foundation. All participants must purify themselves in unison, rouse their resolve, and act with devotion, adhering strictly to the Dao without mingling with heterodox teachings. In prostration, bowing, and yielding, they humble themselves like a chime stone, fulfilling their duty to the utmost.\n\nThe ninth method is the Fast of Instruction, where simplicity and purity are prized. The libationer and the registered disciples share all necessities, enduring hardship without complaint. When hunger strikes, they eat only vegetables, save for those dedicated to the Lord, which they may not consume. After the midday meal, they do not let water pass their teeth, contemplating the scriptures and meditating on the Dao without pause, even for a moment.\n\nIt is also said: The Fast of the Three Origins through Fire and Ash, where austerity is the measure of merit. It absolves the boundless sins of one’s ancestors across countless kalpas, as well as the innumerable transgressions of one’s own family, delivering them from suffering and rescuing others from peril. Its merit is profound beyond measure. The ritual is performed on open ground, where an altar is erected with barriers. All participants, bound by shared qi, are worthy ones who smear their foreheads with yellow mud, let their hair loose, and bind themselves to the barriers with hands tied behind their backs. They hold jade in their mouths, prostrate themselves face-down upon the earth, legs spread three feet apart, and kowtow in repentance. By day, they face west at three intervals; by night, they face north at three intervals.\n\nThe fast consists of three interconnected Origins—Upper, Middle, and Lower—each lasting twelve days, totaling thirty-six days. Upon completing the Lower Origin, they advance to the Middle Origin for twelve days, adding three additional prostrations before concluding. After the Middle Origin, they proceed to the Upper Origin for twelve days, adding five prostrations before concluding. For the conclusion, they face one of the four cardinal directions or four corners, intensifying their austerities.\n\nThe term \"Three Origins\" signifies the beginning of cycles. A year has twelve months and three hundred sixty days; ten days form a decade, and a month has three decades—Upper, Middle, and Lower. Twelve months comprise thirty-six decades, which are divided into three Origins, each spanning twelve days, completing one cycle.\n\nHere ends the *Wondrous Scripture of the Five Responses of the Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure*.",
