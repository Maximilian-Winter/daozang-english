  "full_translation": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Wenzi*\n*Daoist School* – Descriptive Summary\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Wenzi* comprises twelve chapters, authored by Xin Gan of the Zhou. Xu Guang states that Wenzi’s given name was Gan; Li Xian says his surname was Xin, a man from Kuiqiu in Puxiang, styled Jiran. Fan Li studied under him. Pei Yin records that Jiran’s surname was Xin, his courtesy name Wenzi, and that he was a descendant of a prince of Jin. Meng Kang says his surname was Ji and his given name Ran, a minister of Yue. Cai Mo claims that *Jiran* was the title of a book written by Fan Li, not a person, the name meaning “that which is calculated and found correct.” Yan Shigu counters that Cai’s assertion is erroneous: the *Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages* ranks Jiran in the fourth class, listing Jiran as an alternate name for Ji Yan. The *Annals of Wu and Yue* and *Yuejue shu* both write it as Ji Ni, the characters *ni* and *yan* being close in pronunciation and thus prone to confusion.\n\nNow, according to Yu Zhongrong’s *Excerpts from Masters*, there are two Wenzi: one a descendant of the prince of Jin, whose given name is lost, who traveled south to Yue and styled himself Wenzi, also known as Jiran. Fan Li studied under him, and by heeding his counsel, Yue achieved hegemony. This account is not only found in the *Annals of Wu and Yue* but also in Liu Shao’s *Imperial Survey*. The so-called *Fanzi Jiran* consists of Fan Li’s questions and Jiran’s answers. The Wenzi who authored this book, however, must be Xin Gan. Ma Zong’s *Forest of Meanings* lists the *Fanzi Jiran* in thirteen chapters, encompassing yin-yang and calendrical calculations, distinct from this work. The claim that his surname was Xin likely perpetuates the error in the *History of the Northern Dynasties*, which conflates the arts of Tao Zhu with Xin Wen, unaware that Yu’s *Excerpts* originally distinguished two Wenzi.\n\nLiu Zongyuan, in his critique of this book, suggests it was written by a disciple of Laozi, citing passages where Wenzi engages in dialogue with King Ping. Zhou Shi’s *Brush Notes* argues that this refers to King Ping of Chu, implying Wenzi was a Zhou man rather than the Jiran of Wu and Yue—a plausible claim. While the text consistently follows Laozi’s teachings, whether Wenzi was truly Laozi’s disciple remains uncertain. Zongyuan dismisses the book as spurious, mocking its muddled and derivative nature. He notes that nearly all its content is cribbed from the Mencian school and other sources, assembled as if by a magpie. Yet its principles are profound, its prose forceful and refined—unachievable by anyone but a figure of the Zhou-Qin era, setting it apart from the forgeries of Guan Yin and Kang Cang. The *Han Catalogue* records it as nine chapters; the Northern Wei scholar Li Xian and the Tang master Xu Lingfu both annotated twelve-chapter versions. Li’s commentary is now rare, while fragments of Lingfu’s survive. This edition, printed in Wu, is unannotated and divided only into upper and lower volumes. Li Xian studied under the monk Prajñāruci; Lingfu, styled Moxi, once revered this book as the *Tongyuan Zhenjing* during the Tianbao era of Tang. Respectfully submitted in the first month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n*Chief Compilers:*\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n*Chief Collator:*\nMinister Lu Feichi\n\n**Imperially Commissioned Complete Library in Four Branches of Literature**\n*Wenzi, Volume One: \"The Origin of the Dao\"*\n\nLaozi said: There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Only an image—without form, profound and obscure, silent and desolate, faint and indistinct, its sound unheard. I force a name upon it and call it the *Dao*.\n\nNow, the Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond fathoming. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, bestowing and receiving without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, surging yet never full. When turbid, still it slowly clears; when bestowed, it is inexhaustible. It has no fixed time, yet its manifestations never exceed a handful. Contracting, it can expand; hidden, it can illuminate; yielding, it can be firm. It contains yin and exhales yang, thereby manifesting the Three Luminaries. Mountains rise by it; abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it; birds fly by it. Unicorns roam by it; phoenixes soar by it. Stars and planets move by it. It takes from nothingness to preserve being; from humility to attain eminence; from retreat to secure precedence.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao and stood at the center. Spirit roamed with transformation to pacify the four quarters. Thus they could align with Heaven’s revolutions and Earth’s stability, turning without cease. Waters flowed without halting, accompanying things from beginning to end. Winds arose, clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, rain fell—all responded without end.\n\nCarved and polished, it returns to simplicity. By non-action, it acts, yet accords with [the natural]. By non-action in speech, it communicates with virtue. Serene and joyful, without self-importance, it attains.\n\nHarmony encompasses ten thousand differences yet accords with life. Harmony regulates yin and yang, moderates the four seasons, and harmonizes the five phases, moistening grasses and trees, seeping into metal and stone. Birds and beasts grow large, fur and feathers glisten; bird eggs do not spoil, beast fetuses do not miscarry. Fathers know no grief for lost children, elder brothers no sorrow for weeping younger brothers. No child is orphaned, no woman widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not roam—all this is the result of embracing virtue. The eternal Dao of Heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. The myriad things rely on it to live, yet none know its power; rely on it to die, yet none can resent it. It hoards and accumulates without growing richer, distributes and bestows without increasing poverty.\n\nVague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form; indistinct and vague, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds to transformations without shape. It flows unimpeded, never idle in motion, moving with hardness and softness, coiling and uncoiling with yin and yang, rising and falling. Laozi said: \"The great man is serene, without thought; tranquil, without care. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, yin and yang as his drivers. He travels where there is no path, roams without weariness, emerges where there is no exit.\"\n\nWhere there are no gates, taking Heaven as one’s canopy, nothing remains uncovered; taking Earth as one’s chariot, nothing remains unborne. Taking the four seasons as one’s horses, nothing remains uncommanded; taking yin and yang as one’s drivers, nothing remains unprepared. Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, the four limbs unmoving, perception and insight undiminished, one illuminates and perceives all under Heaven—this is grasping the essence of the Dao and beholding the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of all under Heaven cannot be forced; one must follow their spontaneity and extend it. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be averted; one must hold fast to their essence and return to it. Thus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without, honing the spirit and laying aside knowledge and perception. Therefore, in profound nonaction, nothing is left undone; in non-governance, nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nWhat is called \"nonaction\" is not acting before things do; \"non-governance\" is not altering their spontaneity; \"nothing left ungoverned\" is following the mutual arising of things. Laozi said: \"One who grasps the Dao to govern the people responds to affairs as they arise and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their response; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their harmony.\"\n\nThus, the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, level and easy, pure and tranquil, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the Dao; levelness and ease are its plainness; purity and tranquility are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function. Reversion is the constant of the Dao; softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is the strength of the Dao. Purity, unadornment, and simplicity are the trunk of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. Desire and craving unborne are the perfection of emptiness; no preferences or aversions are the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity is the perfection of tranquility; unmixed with things is the perfection of purity. Neither sorrow nor joy is the perfection of virtue.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected person, hearing and sight are set aside, ornamentation is extinguished, the Dao is relied upon, and wisdom is abandoned. Emerging together with the people, one simplifies what is held, reduces what is sought, discards enticements and longings, removes greed and desire, and relinquishes thoughts and anxieties. Simplifying what is held brings clarity; reducing what is sought brings attainment. Thus, with the center controlling the exterior, the hundred affairs are not neglected. If the center attains it, the exterior can be shepherded; the center’s attainment is this:\n\nThe five viscera are at peace, thoughts and anxieties are level, sinews and bones are strong and sturdy, ears and eyes are keen and bright. The great Dao is smooth and broad, departing from the self yet not far. Those who seek it afar go forth only to return. Laozi said: \"The sage forgets governance of others and resides in self-cultivation; esteeming forgetfulness.\"\n\nThe power of position lies in self-attainment; when one attains the self, the world attains me. Joy forgets it; wealth and honor lie in it. Harmonizing knowledge, one makes the self great and the world small, guarding the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: \"Utmost emptiness, profound stillness.\" The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, silent and unmoving. Vast and boundless, it cannot be made external; minute and subtle, it cannot be made internal. Without walls or enclosure, it gives birth to the general names of being and non-being.\n\nThe perfected person embodies it with emptiness and non-being, levelness and ease, purity and tranquility, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity. Not mingling with things, utmost virtue is the Dao of Heaven and Earth—thus they are called perfected persons. The perfected person knows the self as great and the world as small, values governing the self and disdains governing others. Things do not disturb their harmony; desires do not confuse their essence. Their name and form vanish when the Dao is present; when the Dao is absent, they appear. In non-action, affairs are without affairs; in knowing, there is not-knowing.\n\nEmbracing the Heavenly Dao, encompassing the Heavenly mind, they exhale and inhale yin and yang, expel the old and take in the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they roll and unfold. With yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with Heaven; their body is one with the Dao. They take no joy, suffer no sorrow, feel no delight, bear no anger. The myriad things are profoundly the same—without right, without wrong.\n\nWhen form is harmed by the cruelty of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and anxiety, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Thus, the perfected person employs the heart to restore nature, relying on the spirit to support each other and attain beginning and end. Therefore, in sleep, they do not dream; awake, they have no worries.\n\nConfucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and Heavenly harmony will arrive. Gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come. Abandon virtue, and it will become your countenance; the Dao will become your dwelling. Your pupils will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing of the old. Your form will be like withered wood; your heart like dead ashes. Truly, their knowledge does not bend to circumstances, and they hold themselves with boundless ease. Clear and bright, reaching in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attend to life respond to change and act; change arises from the times. Those who know the times follow no constant course. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words; words emerge from knowledge. The wise do not know the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not that of the one who treasures books. Much learning leads to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center. Abandon learning, and there will be no worries; discard sagacity and wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this is nature’s desire. Things arrive, and knowledge responds.\"\n\nWhen knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. Once likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self, and Heavenly principle perishes. Thus, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man—externally transforming with things while inwardly preserving true nature. Those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who exhaust themselves in things end in non-action. Cultivating knowledge with tranquility, uniting the spirit with emptiness—this is to follow the gate of non-doing and wander with the Dao. Those who follow men engage with the vulgar. Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, nor disorder the emotions with desires. Without scheming, things fall into place; without speaking, trust is established; without deliberation, attainment comes; without acting, completion is achieved. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, none feel harmed. The world turns to him, and the wicked fear him, for he contends with nothing. Thus, none dare contend with him.\n\nLaozi said: \"When man follows desire, he loses his nature, and his movements are never upright. In governing the state, this brings chaos; in cultivating the self, it brings decay. Those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain stillness. Human nature is originally without depravity—long immersed in things, it becomes altered and forgets its root, just as water’s nature desires clarity, but sand and stones pollute it. Human nature desires equilibrium, but desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge nor disturb harmony with desire. In joy, he is not exultant; in sorrow, he is not distressed. Therefore, though exalted, he is not imperiled; though secure, he is not overthrown. Even the foolish recognize the value of wise words and sound plans; even the unworthy admire sagely virtue and lofty conduct. Many praise them, but few employ them; many admire them, but few practice them. The reason lies in being entangled by things and bound by custom.\"\n\nThus he said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I refrain from meddling, and the people prosper of their own accord; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people become simple. Stillness is the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and serenity are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is without mind, yet harmonizes with all under Heaven. Spreading virtue without effort, using it without toil, seeing it without sight, hearing it without sound—formless, yet it gives rise to form; soundless, yet the five notes resound; tasteless, yet the five flavors take shape; colorless, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and reality from emptiness. The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes cannot be fully heard; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors cannot be fully tasted; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors cannot be fully seen. In sound, when the gong is established, the five notes take form; in flavor, when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; in color, when whiteness is established, the five hues are complete. In the Dao, when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. Thus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One is discerned in Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is simple as uncarved wood; in its dispersion, it is turbid as muddy water—yet turbid, it slowly clears; empty, it slowly fills. Vast as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds, it seems not to exist yet exists, seems to vanish yet remains.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage establishes a single measure and follows the track, not altering the constant, not changing the norm. He takes the plumb line as his standard, the marking cord as his guide, bending with what is straight, straightening with what is constant. Joy and anger are perversions of the Dao; sorrow and grief are corruptions of virtue; likes and dislikes are excesses of the heart.\"\n\nDesires and cravings are the fetters of life. When one flies into a great rage, the yin is shattered; when one is overcome by great joy, the yang collapses. A feeble qi gives rise to muteness; terror and dread induce madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, forming accumulations. If one can eliminate these five, one aligns with the numinous brightness. The numinous brightness resides within; when one attains what is within, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are level, ears and eyes are keen, sinews and bones are strong and sturdy, one is open and unobstructed without perversity, firm and unyielding without depletion. There is no excess, nothing beyond reach.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the Dao. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable; its length stretches without end, its far-reaching ripples without limit. It exhales and diminishes, yet its increase and decrease surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes the rain and dew of heaven; below, it moistens and nourishes the earth. The myriad things cannot but grow; the hundred affairs cannot but be accomplished. It embraces all living things without partiality, bestowing moisture even upon the crawling and wriggling without seeking repayment. It enriches the world without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without depletion. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not injured; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not burned. Supple and yielding, flowing and following, it cannot be scattered or dispersed. Its sharpness pierces metal and stone; its strength pervades the world, yet it remains ever sufficient. It takes and gives to all things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal to heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat by which water achieves its utmost virtue is its suppleness and smoothness. Thus it is said: \"The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap.\" The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great origin of tones. The true person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with creation. Holding the mysterious virtue in the heart, their transformations move like spirits. Therefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken is vast and boundless. Before issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the work of the heart alone.\n\nAll things have their source, yet only the root is upheld; all affairs have their origin, yet only the gate is guarded. Thus one can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without reflection, respond without knowing.\n\nLaozi said: \"In the Way and its virtue, the will is weak yet the affairs are strong; the heart is empty yet the response is fitting. The weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, and still, concealed in non-acquisition, enacted in inability. Serene and inactive, moving without missing the moment—thus the noble must take the humble as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Relying on the small, it encompasses the great; residing within, it governs without. Acting with softness yet firmness, its strength overcomes all; no enemy can subdue it, no opposition can surpass it. Those who desire firmness must guard with softness; those who desire strength must preserve with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or ruin.\n\nStrength that overcomes what is weaker than oneself reaches its limit when encountering its equal; softness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has power beyond measure. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it tears. The teeth, though harder than the tongue, perish first. Therefore, softness and weakness are the trunk of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. Those who lead perish; those who follow reach their destination. Thus, those who grasp the Dao to adapt to change—whether first or last—control the other. How can they not prevail? What controls them cannot be controlled in return.\n\nWhat is called 'following' is to harmonize with the reckoning and align with the timing. When the moment shifts, there is no room for hesitation. To act first is to overreach; to act later is to fall short. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not wait for people. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the moment, achieves success by relying on resources, upholds the pure Dao, restrains with feminine restraint, follows and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. With softness and stillness, tranquility and stability, their achievements are vast, and nothing firm can contend with them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors scheming, purity is no longer unsullied, and the numinous virtue is not whole within the person. How can one who does not know how distant they are from harm embrace it? When the heart forgets desires and harmful intentions, even a hungry tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculation labor without achievement. Those who enact laws, carve punishments, and execute penalties do not engage in the work of emperors and kings. Those who frequently employ whips and restraints do not govern for the long term. When likes and dislikes are many, calamities follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. Therefore, by following, the great is achieved; by upholding, stability is secured. To act is to fail.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to listen and see wearies the heart and obscures clarity; governing with cunning and planning exhausts the heart and yields no success. Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient for great governance; one person’s ability cannot manage even three acres of land. Following the principles of the Dao and relying on the naturalness of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not enough to equalize. Hearing is misled by praise and blame; the eyes are seduced by colors. Ritual and sincerity are insufficient to dispel attachment; only a sincere heart can embrace the distant.\n\nThus, nothing is sharper than the will; the sword Moye is inferior. No bandit is greater than yin and yang, yet the drumstick is small. What is called the great bandit lies hidden without words, its violence concealed in the mountains; the small bandit lurks among the people. Therefore, when the people abound in cunning and skill, strange things arise; when laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits multiply. Abandoning one and taking the other, heavenly calamities do not arise. Thus, governing the state with wisdom is the state’s thief; not governing the state with wisdom is the state’s virtue.\n\nThe formless is greater than the formed; the formless is more numerous than the formed; the formless is stronger than the formed; the formless is full, while the formed is empty. The formed is the completion of affairs; the formless is the beginning of creation. The completion of affairs produces vessels; the beginning of creation is without form.\"\n\nThe origin is uncarved simplicity. The formed has sound; the formless has no sound. The formed arises from the formless, thus the formless is the beginning of the formed.\n\nVastness and thickness possess names—those with names are prized for wholeness. Frugality and thinness lack names—those without names are held cheap and light. Abundance and wealth possess names—those with names are honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity lack names—those without names are base and humiliated. The male possesses names—those with names are manifest and illustrious. The female lacks names—those without names are subtle and restrained. Surplus possesses names—those with names are exalted and wise. Deficiency lacks names—those without names are tasked with lowly work. Merit brings names; lack of merit brings no names. Names arise from the nameless; the nameless is the mother of names.\n\nThus, the Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete one another. Therefore, the sage holds to the Dao, embracing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue. Where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is name; where there is name, there is a return to the Dao. Merit and name endure long, and one remains free from blame throughout life. Kings and lords possess merit and name; the orphaned and widowed lack merit and name. Thus, the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root. Merit is achieved yet not possessed, thus merit is made into benefit, and namelessness is put to use.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and artless, not knowing east from west. Their appearance did not depart from sincerity; their words did not exceed their actions. Their conduct was without pretense; their clothing was warm yet unadorned; their weapons were blunt and unsharpened. They walked with unhurried steps, gazed with unfocused eyes, drank from their own wells, and ate from their own fields. They did not bestow charity nor seek virtue. High and low did not vie with one another; long and short did not compare. The wind was in harmony with custom, and they followed it. Affairs matched their abilities, and they were easily accomplished. Those who flaunted deceit to delude the world or acted with hypocrisy to mislead the masses—the sage did not regard such as the world’s custom.\n\nThe Power of Sincerity\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height; Earth attains its depth. The sun and moon shine, the stars array themselves, yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by aligning with the Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; rain and dew descend in their time, not to nurture grasses and trees. When spirit and illumination connect, yin and yang harmonize, and the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within and harbors spirit in the heart. Still and silent, serene and joyous, the breast is vast and formless, hushed and soundless. The offices appear as if empty; the court appears as if unpeopled. There are no cunning scholars, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. All under heaven look up to the virtue of their ruler, emulating the sovereign’s restraint. Distant lands and alien customs, though far removed, all come through repeated translation—not because the ruler visits each household and meets each person, but because he extends his sincere heart to all under heaven. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is the proper command, yet what enables its execution is the power of sincerity. Though the command be clear, it cannot act alone; it must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to govern the people yet the people do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven establishes the sun and moon, arrays the stars, unfolds the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. By day it exposes things, by night it lets them rest; with wind it dries them, with rain and dew it moistens them. In generating things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see its prevention, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit illumination. Thus, the sage emulates it: when fortune arises, none see its cause, yet fortune arises; when misfortune is removed, none see its source, yet misfortune departs. Investigating it, one finds nothing; examining it, one discovers no emptiness. Daily reckoning falls short, yet yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is the movement of transformation without intent.\n\nThus, when sincerity takes form within, qi stirs in heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, the rivers do not overflow, the seas do not surge. But when one defies heaven and harms things, the sun and moon suffer eclipse, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons clash, daylight darkens and night shines, mountains collapse, rivers run dry, winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate thus: when a state perishes, celestial omens change; when customs decay, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected, essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the affairs of spirit illumination cannot be achieved through cunning or force. Thus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, aligns illumination with the sun and moon, unites numinosity with gods and spirits, and harmonizes trust with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, holding the qi of earth, grasping the mean and containing harmony, without leaving the hall, he traverses the four seas, transforms customs, and alters habits. The people change toward goodness as if it arose from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\nLaozi said: Those who enter the Dao preserve their nature and safeguard their authenticity, not harming their persons. When pressed by urgency or difficulty, their essence communicates with heaven. As for those who have never departed from their origin—what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced. How much less can one coerce the governance of heaven and earth, the stewardship of the myriad things, the return to transformation, and the containment of supreme harmony? They have never known death or life.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood by others without—this is the unerring Dao. When the sage rules from above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and great indeed! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, treachery and deceit become manifest.\n\nThe celestial spirits and qi respond in mutual resonance—this is called the eloquence of wordlessness, the Way that cannot be spoken. To summon the distant, employ non-action; to draw near, speak of no affairs. Only those who wander in the night can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to fertilize fields, and the tracks of carts do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness while racing, sinking while afloat.\" The Way of heaven is impartial in approach, impartial in departure. The capable have surplus; the inept fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it perish. Therefore, governing with cleverness makes it difficult to sustain the state. Only those who align with the Great Harmony and uphold natural resonance can attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide—distance makes them seem close, closeness makes them seem distant. Scrutinize them, and they cannot be grasped; examine them, and they are not empty. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding, engaging with the myriad things without harming them. In gaining, there is loss; in losing, there is gain. Therefore, those who penetrate the Great Harmony are dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining to wander within it, as if never having departed from their origin—this is called the Great Permeation. This is the art of employing non-employment to achieve its use.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the numbers of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few, the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons ripened without calamity, the hundred officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors were harmonious without grievance, laws and commands were clear and not obscure, assistants were just and not sycophantic, farmers yielded boundaries, roads were free of lost items, and markets had no false pricing. In this time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he slept on stone and rested on rope, killed in autumn, stored in winter, embraced the square earth and held the round heaven. Where yin and yang stagnated and obstructed, he opened the pathways; where qi rebelled and harmed the people, he severed and halted it. The people were like children, unaware of east or west, their eyes dim, their steps stumbling, yet blissfully content, unaware of their origins. They drifted and floated, unknowing of their roots, nourishing themselves without knowing where they went. In this time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes, all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons. His work measured up to heaven and earth. Yet the Yellow Emperor, though inferior to the Great Ancestor, did not display his achievements or exalt his name. This is the Way of the Perfected Person—following the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because the Dao and virtue ascend, while cleverness vanishes.\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the Perfected Person does true wisdom arise. What they uphold is not brightness—how can one know what I call knowledge? Is it not ignorance? Accumulating jujubes and piling goods to make the people joyful and delight in life is benevolence. Establishing great merit, displaying illustrious names, embodying the proper relationship between ruler and minister, clarifying superior and inferior, ordering kin and strangers, rescuing endangered states, restoring extinguished lineages, and establishing heirs for those without descendants is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing the will and intent, discarding cleverness and returning to non-discernment, wandering beyond the dust and grime, roaming in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is virtue. Thus, the Dao disperses into virtue, virtue overflows into benevolence and righteousness, and once benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue decay.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue dissipates, actions become false. When the utmost essence is absent within, yet words and deeds are observed without, one cannot avoid being enslaved by things. When essence is exhausted and actions are without limit, what is guarded is unstable, and one is seduced by the winds of世俗. Thus, the sage cultivates the Dao and its arts within and does not outwardly adorn benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, they wander in the harmony of the spirit—this is the sage’s defense.\n\nLaozi said: As for the sage’s wandering, it is movement in utmost emptiness, the mind roaming in the great void, racing beyond boundaries, acting through no gate, listening to no sound, seeing no form, unbound by the world, unshackled by俗. Thus, what the sage uses to move the world is not the Perfected Person; what the worthy use to correct世俗 is not the sage. Those bound by世俗 must have their forms constrained and spirits fettered, and thus cannot avoid entanglement. If I can be bound and shackled, my fate must lie in what is external.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts are not scattered in the mind, and wisdom does not extend beyond the four domains, embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores, the moon reviews the seasons, and at year’s end, tribute is offered. Nourishing the people with impartiality, authority is stern without admonition, laws are few without excess, teachings are divine, punishments are lenient, prisons are empty, and the world is of one custom, with no one harboring wicked intentions—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nWhen superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without yielding; the people grow poor and suffer, giving rise to strife; their strength is exhausted without result; cunning and deceit sprout; thieves and bandits multiply; superiors and inferiors resent each other; orders are not followed. When water is muddy, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When superiors are greedy, inferiors are deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors demand much, inferiors contend. Not addressing the root but rescuing at the end is no different from digging a ditch to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire. The sage’s affairs are few and well-governed; their demands are few and sufficient. Without acting, there is benevolence; without speaking, there is trust; without seeking, there is attainment; without striving, there is accomplishment. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost truth, holding the Dao, and extending sincerity, the world follows like an echo responding to sound, a shadow resembling form. What they cultivate is the root.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and wisdom and thoughts dissipate within, one cannot govern the body. What the spirit employs is distant, and what it abandons is near. Thus, one does not step beyond the door to know the world, does not peer through the window to know the Way of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows—this speaks of essence and sincerity issuing from within, spirit and qi moving heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things return to them without being summoned, reaching their utmost naturally. The response of utmost essence comes unbidden, departs without going, deep and serene, unknowing of its actions, yet its work is accomplished. Relying on the eyes to see and words to command makes governance difficult.\n\nGao Yao was mute yet served as the Grand Judge, and the realm knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for speech? Shi Kuang was blind yet served as the Grand Minister, and the state of Jin knew no chaotic governance—what need was there for sight? The commands of the wordless, the vision of the sightless—this is how the sage becomes a teacher. The people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but their conduct. Thus, when a ruler delights in valor yet does not restrain contention, the state will face many calamities, and in time, there will surely be the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler delights in beauty yet does not curb licentious talk, the state will fall into disorder, and over time, there will be the disasters of excess and dissipation.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s essence and sincerity are distinguished within, while likes and dislikes are made clear without. Words are issued to match the heart, and decrees are proclaimed to clarify intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to prohibit villainy. Only spiritual transformation is prized; utmost essence becomes spirit. Where essence moves, it is like the spring’s growth or the autumn’s withering. Thus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nLaozi said: Laws are suspended and rewards are set, yet customs cannot be changed—this is because the heart does not embrace sincerity. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their customs; observing their music reveals their manners; seeing their manners reveals their transformation. Those who hold fast to truth and manifest sincerity move heaven and earth, and spirits transcend boundaries. Commands are obeyed, and prohibitions are heeded. Sincerity penetrates the Way and conveys its meaning. Though not a word is spoken, the world’s myriad people, birds, beasts, and spirits transform with it. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Way is non-action. Non-action means non-possession; non-possession means not abiding. Not abiding means dwelling without form; without form means not moving; not moving means no speech. No speech means stillness without sound. Without form, it cannot be seen; without sound, it cannot be heard—this is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit. Vast and continuous, it is called the root of heaven and earth. The Way is without form or sound, so the sage forces a form upon it, naming it with a single word. The Way of heaven and earth is great, yet it takes the small as its root; it is abundant, yet it takes the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are vast, his power and fame are supreme—the beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth. Thus, one cannot but model the Great Way as the mother of the world.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the poor and aiding the distressed brings fame; removing harm and eliminating calamities achieves merit. In a world without disasters, even sages have no place to apply their virtue; when superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no place to establish their merit. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Way, extends sincerity, delights in giving, and possesses boundless wisdom. They rest in silence and do not speak, yet the world does not know how to value their wordlessness. Thus, the Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way; the name that can be named is not the constant name. What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, or transmitted to others—these are but its coarse aspects.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different affairs with the same heart and took different paths to the same end. Scholars of later ages do not understand the embodiment of the Way or the summation of the One Virtue. They seek only the traces of accomplished deeds, kneeling and sitting to discourse on them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of as the Way. The sage does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world—his influence is more urgent than a shout. Thus, shared words are trusted because trust precedes the words; shared commands are obeyed because sincerity lies beyond the commands. When the sage is above, the people transform as if by spirit. When emotions precede them and move above yet find no response below, it is because emotions and commands differ. A three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet the loving mother cherishes it all the more—this is the power of emotion. Thus, the use of words brings change, but the change is small; the use of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trusting the noble person’s words and being loyal to their intent—loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without. This is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father or a minister’s death for his lord is not to seek fame by dying. Kindness is stored within and does not shirk hardship. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned—it arises from within. One must also examine their conduct. The sage is not ashamed before shadows; the noble person is cautious in solitude. Abandoning the near to seek the distant is obstruction. Thus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, the people long for his will, never forgetting his desire to benefit others.\n\nLaozi said: A brave warrior’s shout makes the three armies retreat—this is the power of his sincerity. If one sings and none harmonize, or gives orders and none carry them out, there must be discord within. Thus, to rectify the world without rising from one’s seat is to seek it within oneself. Where persuasion does not reach, demeanor does; where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does; where subtle influence reaches the heart and takes form, essence is at its utmost—it can be met in form but cannot be awaited with expectation.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source; affairs have their root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, is not as good as few words. To harm the many, Ruo cut off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise craftsman does not rely on ability but on timing. Not knowing when to close, he must block before opening.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths to the same end. Survival and ruin, stability and collapse—all are as one to the unwavering mind, never forgetting the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all bring sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy; wailing is the manifestation of sorrow. What is within is expressed without—thus, it depends on how one influences them. The sage’s heart day and night does not forget the desire to benefit others, and the reach of his influence is far indeed.\n\nLaozi said: When people practice non-action, there is governance; when they practice action, there is harm. Those who govern through non-action yet act harm non-action. Those who cannot practice non-action cannot practice action. When people are wordless, the spirit has words—yet those who harm wordlessness by speaking injure the spirit’s spirituality.\n\nWenzi said: Names can be forcibly established; merits can be forcibly achieved. In the past, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Way was lacking in himself. He went south to see Laozi and received a single teaching. His spirit became enlightened, his troubles dissolved, and his thoughts flowed smoothly. He toiled for ten days without eating, as if feasting on grand offerings. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages, his wisdom and strategies spanned heaven and earth, and his discernment was as fine as autumn hairs. His praise spread throughout China and the barbarian lands, continuing to this day without cease—this is what it means to forcibly establish a name.\n\nThus, if farmers do not strive, their granaries will not be full; if officials do not exert themselves, their sincerity will not be refined; if generals and ministers do not strengthen themselves, their achievements will not be accomplished; if kings and marquises grow lax, their names will not endure in later ages. The perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder and lightning held in reserve—acting in accord with the times, establishing merit through available resources, advancing and retreating without difficulty, and penetrating all things without obstruction.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and their virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, they rejoice without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, they are vigilant as if on guard. Those who sorrow with the people’s sorrows will have the people sorrow with their sorrows; those who delight in the people’s joys will have the people delight in their joys. Thus, to sorrow with the world and delight with the world—yet not become king—has never been known.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached, abiding in an unshakable place, accumulating in an inexhaustible storehouse, and bearing its load in an unfailing treasury. Their decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices of no contention, opening gates that must be entered, not attempting what cannot be accomplished, not seeking what cannot be obtained, not dwelling where one cannot remain, and not acting where one cannot return.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings delight, and none fail to follow their commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm and success becomes failure. The so-called great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—internally strong like heaven and earth, externally luminous like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without fail; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person reveals goodness to others without altering their fundamental nature or changing their constant principles. The world obeys their decrees as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, Jupiter’s movements shrink or expand without constancy. When governance falters in summer, Mars moves in retrograde. When governance falters in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, its movements erratic. When governance falters in winter, Mercury fails to appear in its proper quarter. When the four seasons lose their proper governance, Saturn sways unsteadily, the sun and moon display portents, the five planets rebel in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish. When summer governance is not lost, timely rains descend. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper. When winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being.\n\n**Nine Observances**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was only a profound, indistinct vastness—undifferentiated, silent, and clear. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. Separating, they formed the four seasons; dividing, they became yin and yang. Essence-qi became humans; coarse qi became insects. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates in heaven; bones and skeleton are rooted in earth. Spirit enters its gate; bones and skeleton return to their root. What, then, remains of me? Thus, the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom or swayed by others. They take heaven as father, earth as mother, yin and yang as guiding principles, and the four seasons as their order.\n\nHeaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. Those who oppose the myriad things perish; those who follow them live. Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are the dwelling of the Dao.\n\nSpirit and essence are what one receives from heaven; bones and skeleton are what one is endowed with from earth. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending their qi to achieve harmony.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is fully formed; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera are differentiated: the liver governs the eyes, the kidneys govern the ears, the spleen governs the tongue, the lungs govern the nose, and the gallbladder governs the mouth.\n\nExternally, the body has its surface; internally, it has its depths. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has the four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder becomes clouds, the lungs become qi, the spleen becomes wind, the kidneys become rain, and the liver becomes thunder.\n\nHumans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs them. The ears and eyes are like the sun and moon; blood and qi are like wind and rain.\n\nWhen the sun and moon lose their proper courses, eclipsing and dimming their light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, destroying and bringing calamity; when the five stars deviate from their paths, the states and regions suffer their misfortune—such is the Dao of heaven and earth, vast and great, yet ever reliant upon moderation in its manifestations, cherishing its numinous clarity. How can human ears and eyes long endure fumigation without rest? How can the spirit gallop without exhaustion?\n\nThus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external. Blood and qi are the blossoms of the person; the five viscera are the essence of the person. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision acute—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart from it, qi and intent prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus one hears all without fail, sees all without obstruction, and accomplishes all without hindrance. Misfortune and disaster have no means of entry, and pathogenic qi cannot invade.\n\nThose who seek much gain little; those who perceive the great know little. The orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; blood and qi are the messengers of the five viscera. Thus when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and the spirit gallops without restraint. Though calamity and fortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to recognize them.\n\nThus the sage receives without transgressing. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and penetrating, with nothing to lure or entice, and that intent and qi are not lost, remaining pure and with few desires, the five viscera are at ease, the spirit is guarded within, and the body does not transgress. Then one may observe the external affairs of past ages and the internal matters of fortune and misfortune—all becomes clearly visible. Thus the farther one ventures outward, the less one knows. This speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds disturb the ears, rendering them unhearing; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing it to suffer sores. Preferences and aversions confuse the heart, causing conduct to become reckless. Thus desires cause qi to become excessive, and likes and dislikes cause the spirit to labor. If one does not swiftly depart from them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespans is due to their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to thereby attain longevity.\n\nHeaven and earth move and interpenetrate; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to be unable to know the One is to be unable to know anything. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and things are also things. How can things be compared to one another? The desire for life cannot be pursued; the aversion to death cannot be avoided. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling into it without daring to exceed it—this is the utmost joy. Guarding emptiness, Laozi said:\n\nThe so-called sage follows the times and is at ease in their position, content with their lot in the present age. Grief and joy are perversions of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the movement of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. At rest, one harmonizes with yin; in motion, one moves with yang. Thus the heart is the master of the body, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. If the body labors without rest, it stumbles; if essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore the sage abides by this and does not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its limits. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one fulfills their mandate. Without estrangement or partiality, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony, one accords with heaven, joins with the Dao as their boundary, and neighbors with virtue. They do not initiate fortune, nor do they precede calamity. Life and death bring no change to them. Thus it is said: the utmost spirit seeks and obtains all without fail, accomplishing all without hindrance.\n\nGuarding Emptiness, Laozi said:\nTo regard the world lightly is to keep the spirit unburdened; to treat the myriad things as trivial is to keep the heart unconfused. Equalizing life and death, intent is not daunted; unifying transformation, clarity is not obscured. The perfected person leans upon an unyielding pillar, walks an unobstructed path, draws from an inexhaustible storehouse, and studies with an undying teacher. They go nowhere without success, reach nowhere without penetration. In bending and stretching, rising and lowering, they embrace their fate without confusion, and misfortune and fortune, benefit and harm are insufficient to trouble their heart.\n\nThose who act with righteousness may be compelled by benevolence but cannot be coerced by arms; they may be rectified by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or nobility. Those who act with righteousness cannot be frightened by death—how much more so for those who practice non-action? Those who practice non-action are without burdens. The burdenless person regards the world as their shadow and echo. Observing the ranks of the perfected above, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining the conduct of the vulgar below, one is sufficiently ashamed. Those who do not treat the world as something to be used are like those who study by beating the war drum.\n\nGuarding Equilibrium, Laozi said:\nEsteeming power and coveting profit are what people desire. Compared to the body, these are base. Thus the sage eats enough to fill the belly and sustain qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold, and satisfies their emotions while rejecting excess. They do not covet gain or accumulate much. With clear eyes that do not see and still ears that do not hear, they close their mouths and do not speak, relinquish their hearts and do not ponder. Abandoning cleverness and returning to simplicity, resting the spirit and forsaking knowledge—thus they have no preferences and no aversions. This is called the Great Penetration. To eliminate obstacles and remove burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What cannot be accomplished? To know the harmony of nurturing life is not to be lured by profit; to understand the correspondence of internal and external is not to be enticed by power. The external of the external is the greatest; the internal of the internal is the most noble. To know great nobility, where does one not succeed?\n\nGuarding Simplicity, Laozi said:\nThe ancients who practiced the Dao ordered their natures and governed their hearts, nurturing with harmony and maintaining with suitability. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot lowliness; content with virtue, they forgot poverty. In their nature, there was nothing they desired; if they did not desire, they did not obtain it. In their hearts, there was nothing they rejoiced in; if they did not rejoice, they did not do it. What did not benefit their nature, they did not burden their virtue with; what was not conducive to life, they did not disturb their harmony with. They did not indulge their bodies or give free rein to their intentions, yet their regulations could serve as models for the world. They ate according to their bellies’ measure, clothed themselves according to their bodies’ form, dwelled in accord with their bodies, and acted in accord with their emotions. They relinquished the world without possessing it, entrusted the myriad things without profiting from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who can do this may be said to embody the Dao.\n\nGuarding Clarity, Laozi said:\nHumans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes’ relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth’s relation to fragrances and odors, the skin’s relation to cold and warmth—these are all the same in essence. Yet some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty persons. The distinctions lie in their regulations. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level.\n\nNo one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus when the spirit is clear and intent is level, one can perceive the essence of things. Those who employ it must borrow from those who do not. A bright mirror is not marred by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. Thus when the heart reaches a point, the spirit is surely present; returning to emptiness, agitation dissipates and the storehouse of rest is sealed. This is the wandering of the sage. Therefore, to govern the world, one must first understand the essence of nature and life.\n\nThen one may proceed.\n\nTo Preserve the True\n\nLaozi said: What is called the sage merely accords with the genuine. Measuring the belly to eat, gauging the form to clothe—restraining the self so that covetous and corrupt thoughts have no means to arise. Thus one who can possess the world must not treat the world as a possession; one who can attain fame and reputation must not seek them through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the essence of nature and life, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere.\n\nAs for the spirit, nothing obscures it; the heart, nothing burdens it—penetrating and unimpeded, flowing in perfect clarity, serene and without affair. Power and profit cannot lure it; sound and beauty cannot seduce it; eloquence cannot persuade it; cunning cannot move it; courage cannot frighten it. This is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThat which gives life does not live; that which transforms does not transform. Those who do not grasp this Dao—though they command the governance of heaven and earth, illuminate like the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make their words shine like metal and stone—still gain no benefit in governing the world. Thus the sage does not lose what they preserve.\n\nTo Preserve Stillness\n\nLaozi said: Stillness, silence, tranquility, and simplicity—these nurture life. Harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness—these uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one attains nature and finds its proper place. Still and unmoving, harmonious and at ease, virtue rests in its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to fulfill one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nThose who are thus have blood and vessels free from stagnation, the five organs free from accumulated qi. Fortune and misfortune cannot deceive; praise and blame cannot defile. Without possessing the world, who could bring it to order? Possessing talent but not meeting the times, the self cannot even escape—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nThe eye that discerns the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; the ear that harmonizes the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus when the small is held in mind, the great is forgotten.\n\nNow the myriad things assail, blocking our life, seizing our essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf a basin of water is clear, after a day one can see the brows and lashes; if muddied, even with a single stir one cannot discern square from round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy—just like the water in the basin. Preserve the method.\n\nLaozi said: The highest sage models Heaven; the next esteems worthies; the lowest employs ministers. To employ ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to esteem worthies is the source of delusion and confusion. To model Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness are its foundation—emptiness admits nothing, stillness holds all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus the sage takes stillness as governance and movement as disorder. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb, do not agitate, and the myriad things will clear themselves; do not alarm, do not frighten, and the myriad things will order themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\n**Preserve Weakness**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world and a single state as their household, and the myriad things as their storehouse. With the vastness of the world and the multitude of the myriad things, their qi becomes full and their aspirations arrogant. The great use troops to invade the small; the small are haughty and domineering toward those below. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long. Thus the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and practicing non-action, without diminishing. The qi of the Unfathomable appears small and preserves softness; it retreats and does not possess. It models itself on the rivers and seas—the rivers and seas do not act, yet their fame and merit transform naturally. They do not strive, thus they can perfect their kingship. Being the female of the world, they can spiritually endure without perishing. Loving themselves, they can perfect their nobility. The power of ten thousand chariots and the achievements of the myriad things—authority and responsibility are most weighty. One cannot treat oneself lightly; to treat oneself lightly is to fail in fame and merit. The Dao is great, yet it is completed through the small; it is abundant, yet it takes the few as its master. Thus the sage governs the world with the Dao. The subtlety of softness and weakness lies in perceiving the small; frugality and thrift lie in perceiving the few. Perceiving the small, one can perfect the great; perceiving the few, one can perfect the beautiful. The Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low; it diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to them and offers them tribute. The sage is humble, tranquil, yielding, and modest—these are the signs of lowness. An empty mind and nothingness are the signs of insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, one can attain the high; perceiving insufficiency, one can perfect worthiness. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure. The violent die; the self-satisfied perish. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot hold for a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains embody the qi of violence, thus they cannot last and perish. Small valleys occupy the place of violence, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons extravagance and arrogance, and does not dare to act with violent qi. Holding to the female and the yielding, one can establish one’s maleness; not daring to be extravagant and arrogant, one can endure long.\n\n**Laozi said:** The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then returns; fullness is followed by loss—such are the sun and moon. Thus the sage daily diminishes and the qi of the Unfathomable does not dare to fill itself; daily advancing with the female, its power and virtue do not decline. Such is the Dao of Heaven. The nature of human emotions all favors the high and dislikes the low, favors gain and dislikes loss, favors profit and dislikes harm, favors honor and dislikes humility, favors nobility and dislikes baseness. The multitude acts accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; they grasp for it, thus they cannot obtain. Therefore the sage models Heaven, achieves without acting, and obtains without grasping. Sharing the same emotions as others but following a different Dao, he can endure long. Thus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called \"assisting cups.\" When empty, they stood upright; when full, they overturned. Things flourish and then decline; the sun reaches its zenith and then moves on; the moon becomes full and then wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Therefore, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom preserve them with foolishness; those with extensive learning and eloquent debate preserve them with frugality; those with martial strength and courage preserve them with awe; those with wealth and nobility preserve them with restraint; those who bestow virtue upon the world preserve it with yielding. These five were how the former kings preserved the world. Those who practice this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one’s worn-out state not be renewed.\n\n**Laozi said:** The sage aligns with yin, closing with it; aligns with yang, opening with it. Able to reach the absence of joy, there is nothing not joyful. With nothing not joyful, one attains the ultimate joy. This is inner joy, not allowing external things to bring joy within. Thus there is self-joy, and there is self-aspiration, esteemed by the world. The reason for this is that it relies on the world to be the essential matter of the world. It does not lie in others but in oneself; it does not lie in others but in one’s own person. When the person attains it, the myriad things are complete. Therefore, those who penetrate the discourse on the art of the mind are beyond external desires, likes, and aversions. Thus there is nothing to delight in, nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in, nothing to suffer. The myriad things are profoundly united—there is no \"not this,\" no \"that.\" Therefore, the scholar has unchanging principles; the woman has unalterable conduct. They do not rely on power to be honored, do not require wealth to be rich, do not need strength to be powerful. They do not profit from material goods, do not covet worldly fame. They do not find security in nobility nor peril in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and aspiration each reside in their proper place. Form is the vessel of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life.\n\nA single misplacement of these three injures them all. Thus, those who take spirit as their master find form obedient and beneficial; those who take form as their master find spirit obedient yet harmful to life. The greedy and gluttonous, covetous of many desires, are ever wary of power and profit, lured by fame and rank. When one’s position is exalted above the world, the spirit daily depletes, drifting far in excess without return. When form seals itself within, resisting entry, there is no way in. Hence arises the affliction of blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, aspiration, and qi—when tranquil, they daily flourish and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage preserves and nurtures the spirit, harmonizes and softens the qi, levels and pacifies the form, floating and sinking with the Dao. Thus, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart; the changes of a hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nHold to simplicity. Laozi said: The so-called \"True Person\" is one whose nature accords with the Dao. Thus, they possess yet seem empty; are full yet seem hollow. They cultivate the inner, not the outer; comprehend the Great Simplicity, practice non-action, and return to uncarved simplicity. They embody the root, embrace the spirit, and wander at the root of heaven and earth, drifting beyond the dust and grime, at ease in the work of no-affairs. Schemes, cunning, and cleverness are not carried in the heart. Discerning without reliance, not shifting with things, they perceive the transformations of affairs yet hold to their origin. The mind’s intent is concentrated within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding without knowing what they do, moving without knowing where they go, they know without learning, see without looking, accomplish without acting, distinguish without governing.\n\nStirred, they respond; pressed, they move; compelled, they proceed—like light’s radiance, like a shadow’s echo. Following the Dao, they depend on conditions to be so. Vast and empty, clear and still, they take no measure of a thousand lives as one, nor a myriad differences as a single origin. They possess essence yet do not employ it; have spirit yet do not use it. Guarding the great undifferentiated simplicity, they stand at the center of utmost refinement. In sleep, they do not dream; in wisdom, they do not sprout. In movement, they are formless; in stillness, they are bodiless. Present yet as if absent, alive yet as if dead, entering and exiting without gap, they command the spirits—what the spirit and essence can achieve is to ascend and borrow from the Dao.\n\nWhen spirit and essence flow freely without losing their origin, day and night without gap, they become springtime to things—this is what it means to unite and give life to the times within the heart. Thus, form may decay, yet spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation with non-transformation, through a thousand changes and ten thousand turns, it never reaches an end. The transforming returns to formlessness; the unchanging is born together with heaven and earth.\n\nThus, the living never truly live—their so-called life is but transformation. The transforming never truly transform—their so-called transformation is but change. This is the wandering of the True Person, the pure and unadulterated Dao.\n\n*Fu Yan* states: Laozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; profoundly deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It envelops heaven and earth without inside or outside, pervades and covers all without obstruction. Therefore, those who embody the Dao are neither angered nor delighted. Seated, they are without care; asleep, they do not dream. They see things yet name them not; affairs arrive, and they respond.\n\nLaozi said: Those who desire to claim fame must create affairs. Creating affairs, they abandon the public and pursue the private, betray the Dao and rely on their own views. Seeking praise, they do good; establishing a name, they act as worthies. Yet governance that does not follow principle leads to much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Rashly striving to hit the mark, success is insufficient to absolve responsibility; failure is enough to destroy the self.\n\nLaozi said: Do not be the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move when compelled. Desire fortune? First, be without misfortune. Desire benefit? First, distance harm. Thus, those who are tranquil through non-action—if they lose their tranquility, they fall into danger. Those who govern through non-action—if they lose their governance, they fall into chaos. Therefore, do not desire to be as busy as jade or as aloof as stone. The more ornate the pattern, the more the skin will peel; the finer the horns, the more the body will be slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words will later bring fault; stones with jade injure their mountains. The suffering of the black-haired people surely lies before their words. The reason the common folk bring calamity upon themselves is their reckless discussion of the state’s laws and standards.\n\nLaozi said: Those who act in accord with the times follow the Dao; those who do not know the Dao take fortune as misfortune, heaven as a canopy, earth as a chariot-axle. Those who skillfully use the Dao will never be exhausted. Earth as a chariot-axle, heaven as a canopy—those who skillfully use the Dao will never be harmed. Though the five phases contend, there must be a victor. What heaven covers is never unbalanced. Thus, to know without knowing is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal, stones give birth to jade—they mutually wear each other away. Trees give birth to insects, which devour them in return. People create affairs, which harm them in turn. Those who love meddling are never without trouble; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Good swimmers drown; good riders fall. Each is undone by what they love. Success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth congeals below, does not contend for height—thus it is secure and not in danger. Water flows downward, does not contend for speed—thus it departs yet does not lag. Therefore, the sage has no attachments and thus no losses; practices non-action and thus no defeats.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot exhaust it; two words are the world’s standard. Three words are the lords’ might; four words are the world’s harmony. Integrity and trust cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the world’s standard. Elevating worthies and virtue makes the lords mighty; hating the few and loving the many brings the world harmony.\n\nLaozi said: People meet three kinds of death not ordained by fate. Immoderate in drink and food, they belittle their bodies—disease kills them. Delighting without cease, seeking without end—punishment kills them. With few, they offend the many; with the weak, they bully the strong—weapons kill them.\n\nLaozi said: Those who bestow generously receive beautiful recompense; those who harbor great resentment suffer deep calamity. To give little yet expect much, to nurture resentment yet hope for no misfortune—such has never been. Examine what has gone, and you will know what is to come.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the mandate of heaven, govern the art of the mind, order likes and dislikes, and adapt to the nature of emotions—thus the governance of the Dao is unimpeded. Trace the mandate of heaven, and you will not be deluded by fortune and misfortune. Govern the art of the mind, and you will not recklessly rejoice or anger. Order likes and dislikes, and you will not covet the useless. Adapt to the nature of emotions, and desires will not exceed measure. Unconfused by fortune and misfortune, your movement and stillness will follow principle. Without reckless joy or anger, rewards and punishments will not be biased. Without coveting the useless, you will not harm your nature with desire. Desires not exceeding measure, you will nourish life and know contentment. These four do not seek from without nor borrow from others; turn inward, and you will obtain them.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue actions that can be criticized; do not resent others’ criticism of yourself. Cultivate the virtue of sufficient praise; do not seek others’ praise. You cannot prevent misfortune from arriving—trust in not welcoming it. You cannot ensure fortune will come—trust in not yielding it. Misfortune’s arrival is not of your making—thus, though impoverished, you are not sorrowful. Fortune’s coming is not of your achievement—thus, though successful, you are not proud. Therefore, dwelling in leisure, you are joyful; practicing non-action, you govern.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao abides in what one already possesses and does not seek what one has yet to obtain. Seeking what one has yet to obtain, what one already has will be lost. Following what one already possesses, what one desires will arrive. Governance that relies not on preventing disorder but on maintaining order is surely precarious. Conduct that has not yet escaped wrongdoing but hastily seeks fame will surely be worn away. Thus, no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune, and no benefit is greater than the absence of defense. Some things, when augmented, are diminished; when diminished, are augmented. The Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue profit, but it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Therefore, one may taste the absence of misfortune but not the presence of fortune; taste the absence of guilt but not the presence of merit. The Dao says: Vast and obscure, it follows the majesty of Heaven, sharing Heaven’s qi. Without thought or planning, without preparation or storage, it does not welcome what comes nor impede what goes. Though people move east, west, south, or north, it stands alone at the center. Thus, amidst crooked multitudes, it does not lose its straightness; flowing with the world, it does not depart from its domain. It does no good, avoids no ugliness, follows Heaven’s Way, initiates nothing, does not monopolize itself, adheres to Heaven’s principle, makes no plans, does not discard the times, and takes Heaven as its measure. It seeks no gain, declines no fortune, follows Heaven’s norm. Within, there is no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise.\n\nWhen people become thieves, the highest virtue speaks with one voice, acts with one accord—above and below, hearts united, without divergence. Those who see from the roadside are turned from evil and guided toward goodness, and the people turn toward uprightness.\n\nLaozi said: To do good is to encourage; to do evil is to observe. Encouragement gives rise to reproach; observation gives rise to resentment. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame but can be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor reputation through knowledge and perception. Governance follows nature, and one who has nothing to do with it may yet achieve what those who strive do not attain. People may be exhausted, but the Dao is never obstructed. Those with wisdom yet practice non-action achieve the same merit as the unwise; those with ability yet do nothing possess the same virtue as the incapable. Wise yet appearing unwise, capable yet appearing incapable, the Dao prevails and human talent fades. When people and the Dao cannot both be manifest, if people love fame, they do not employ the Dao; if the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao recedes and human fame flourishes, danger and ruin follow.\n\nLaozi said: To have trustworthy men distribute wealth is not as good as determining shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intention cannot be as impartial as those without. To have incorruptible men guard wealth is not as good as sealing it behind closed doors. For those with desire cannot be as incorruptible as those without. If people point out one’s flaws, one resents it; if a mirror reveals one’s ugliness, one improves. One who can engage with things without entangling the self avoids encumbrance.\n\nLaozi said: In all dealings with others, if not with treasures and gifts, one must use humble words. Gifts may be meager, but desires are insatiable; humble posture and flattering speech may not forge lasting bonds. Oaths and pledges are made, yet betrayal comes first. Therefore, the noble person does not adorn the outside with benevolence and righteousness but cultivates the Dao and virtue within. They attend to affairs within their domain, exhaust the breadth of their land, encourage the people to hold fast to death, fortify their walls, and unite above and below in defending the altars of soil and grain. Thus, those who act for fame do not attack; those who act for profit without guilt do not invade. This is the Way of certain preservation and the principle of assured benefit.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome the heart; the multitude does not overcome desire. The noble person acts with upright qi; the petty person acts with perverse qi. Internally, it accords with one’s nature; externally, it conforms to righteousness. Moving in accordance with principle, not bound to things—this is upright qi. Indulging in flavors, lusting after sounds and colors, giving rein to joy and anger without regard for consequences—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright harm each other; desire and nature harm each other. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Thus, the sage reduces desire to follow nature. The eye delights in beauty, the ear in sound, the nose in fragrance, the mouth in taste—when these senses are gratified together, they do not depart from considerations of benefit and harm, which are the objects of desire. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; it is the heart that governs them, each obtaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desire cannot prevail.\n\nLaozi said: In cultivating the self and nourishing one’s nature, one regulates rest and activity, harmonizes food and drink, and moderates joy and anger, so that what is within the self is attained and perverse qi has no way to enter. Adorning the outside harms the inside; indulging the emotions harms the spirit. What is seen as refinement obscures the truth. Those who for a moment do not forget their worthiness will surely exhaust their nature; those who within a hundred paces do not forget their appearance will surely burden their form. Thus, beautiful plumage harms the bones; lush branches and leaves harm the roots. To excel in both is impossible under Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven has its brightness and does not worry that the people are benighted; Earth has its wealth and does not worry that the people are poor. The highest virtue and the Dao are like a towering mountain, steadfast and unmoving. Travelers take them as their guide, straight and sufficient for all things. They do not bestow gifts upon people, nor do those who use them receive their virtue. Thus, abiding in peace, they endure long. Heaven and Earth do not interfere, thus they do not seize; they have no virtue.\n\nThus, there is no resentment. Those who are skilled in anger will surely incur much resentment; those who are skilled in giving will surely be skilled in seizing. Only by following the natural course of Heaven and Earth can one prevail over principle. Therefore, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil accompanies it. Profit becomes harm at its inception; fortune becomes misfortune at its outset. If one does not seek profit, there will be no harm; if one does not seek fortune, there will be no misfortune. The body takes preservation as its constant; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nLaozi said: The sage wears no eccentric garments nor performs strange deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious, unobstructed yet not florid, impoverished yet not cowed, honored yet not conspicuous, humbled yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In their shared use, there is nothing by which to name them—this is called the Great Pervasion.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is straight and awaits the arrival of its time; it cannot be welcomed by turning back. When its time departs, it cannot be grasped by clinging. Thus, the sage does not advance to seek nor retreat to yield, but follows the times. When the three seasons pass, I run after them; when the three seasons come, I follow behind. Without departing or approaching, I stand centered in my place. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it only accompanies virtue. Fortune arrives not by one’s own seeking, thus one does not boast of merit; misfortune comes not from one’s own doing, thus one does not regret one’s conduct. The heart is tranquil and unburdened by virtue. Though dogs bark, one is not startled, trusting in one’s true nature. With sincerity and no transgression of one’s lot, the one who embodies the Dao is not deluded; the one who knows fate is not anxious. When emperors and kings perish, their bones are buried in the wild, yet their sacrifices are conducted in the Bright Hall—this is because the spirit is prized over the form. Thus, when the spirit governs the form, the form obeys; when the form overpowers the spirit, it is exhausted. Though intelligence and acuity are employed, they must return to the spirit—this is called the Great Pervasion.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness, thus their names remained unmoved. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty, thus their hearts remained unmoved by profit. Therefore, they were humble yet able to rejoice, tranquil yet able to be content. To calculate one’s lifespan while worrying over the world’s chaos is like weeping to replenish a drying river. Thus, one who does not worry over the world’s chaos but delights in its order may be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: People have three resentments—those with high rank are envied, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with ample emolument are resented. Thus, the higher the rank, the more one should lower one’s intentions; the greater the office, the smaller one’s heart should be; the thicker the emolument, the more one should extend one’s beneficence. Cultivating these three ensures resentment does not arise. Therefore, nobility takes lowliness as its root, and height takes lowness as its foundation.\n\nLaozi said: Speech is the means by which one communicates oneself to others; hearing is the means by which others communicate to oneself. Being both blind and deaf, the Way of Man is obstructed. Those afflicted with blindness and deafness do not know how to manage affairs—how could it be only the body that suffers from blindness and deafness? The heart, too, has its obstructions, unaware of what it should connect with—this is the malady of blindness and deafness. The Dao is the ancestor of all things: all that has form is born from it, and its kinship is intimate. Those who consume grain and breathe qi all attain longevity—its lordship is generous. All the wise study it—its teaching is luminous. Yet people harm what is useful with what is useless. Thus, knowledge is not broad, and days are insufficient. The days spent on games like *bo* and *yi* could be used to inquire into the Dao. Not hearing and not asking are like blindness and deafness compared to others.\n\nLaozi said: In human nature, the heart submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue lies in giving, not in seeking. Thus, the sage who wishes to be valued by others first values others; who wishes to be honored by others first honors others; who wishes to prevail over others first prevails over himself; who wishes to humble others first humbles himself. Thus, nobility and lowliness, honor and humility are regulated by the Dao. The ancient sage-kings humbled their words before others and placed themselves behind others—then the world joyfully pushed them forward without tiring, bore them without feeling burdened. This is because their virtue was weighty and overflowing, and their qi was harmonious. Thus, to know that giving is taking and that putting others first is putting oneself first is to guard the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Those with little virtue but much favor invite ridicule; those with meager talent but high position court danger; those with no great merit but ample emolument invite calamity. Thus, some things gain by being diminished, while others lose by being augmented. The multitude knows the benefit of benefit but not the harm of harm. Only the sage knows that harm is benefit and benefit is harm. Thus, a tree that bears fruit repeatedly will surely damage its roots; a household that hoards excessively will surely bring misfortune upon its descendants. The greatest profit turns into harm—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The petty man engages in affairs saying, \"Let me gain by any means\"; the noble man says, \"Let me act righteously.\" The good do not seek fame, yet fame follows them. Fame does not arrange to meet with profit, yet profit accrues to it. What they seek is the same, but what they reach differs. Thus, when action brings benefit, harm follows; when words lack constancy and conduct lacks consistency, this is the petty man. One who is discerning in one matter and proficient in one skill is a mediocre person. One who encompasses all and possesses both skill and talent is a sage.\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, in an orderly age, one defends oneself with righteousness; in a chaotic age, one defends righteousness with oneself. The day of death is the end of one’s conduct. Therefore, the noble man is cautious in his single use of it. Life is received from Heaven; fate is encountered in the times. To have the talent but not meet the age is Heaven’s doing. To seek it by proper means is to obtain it by fate. The noble man can do good but cannot ensure he will receive fortune; he refrains from doing wrong yet cannot guarantee he will avoid misfortune. Thus, when the noble man encounters the times, he advances and obtains it with righteousness—what good fortune! When the times do not favor him, he retreats and yields with propriety—what misfortune! Therefore, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he has no regrets, for he has attained what he values.\n\nLaozi said: People have qi of compliance and rebellion born from the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi is compliant; when the heart is disordered, qi is rebellious. The order or disorder of the heart lies in moral virtue. Attaining the Dao, the heart is ordered; losing the Dao, the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, interactions are yielding; when the heart is disordered, interactions are contentious. Yielding brings virtue; contention breeds harm. With virtue, qi is compliant; with harm, qi is rebellious. Compliant qi diminishes oneself to serve others; rebellious qi diminishes others to serve oneself. These two qi can be guided and controlled by the self. The Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to a sound: virtue accumulates and fortune is born; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises. Officials fail in office; filial piety wanes with wives and children; suffering arises from worry; illness worsens when near recovery. Thus, being as cautious at the end as at the beginning ensures no failure in affairs.\n\nLaozi said: What if one promotes the crooked alongside the straight? One should not promote the straight alongside the crooked—do not proceed with such a course. This is what is meant by \"sharing the same filth yet differing in mud.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage equates life and death; the foolish also equate life and death. The sage equates life and death because he understands their inherent principles; the foolish equate life and death because they do not know where benefit and harm lie. The Dao hangs in the sky, things spread across the earth, and harmony resides in people. If the ruler of men is not harmonious, Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not rise, yin and yang are not regulated, wind and rain are untimely, and the people suffer illness and famine.\n\nLaozi said: To gain the troops of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing a single apt word. To obtain the Pearl of Marquis Sui is not as good as grasping the origins of affairs. To acquire the Jade of He the Duke is not as good as knowing the proper course of action. Though the world be vast, those fond of using troops will perish their states; though secure, those fond of war will endanger themselves. Thus, in a small state with few people, though there be tools of ten or a hundred times the utility, they are not to be used.\n\nLaozi said: Those who can become hegemons or kings must be those who prevail. Those who can prevail over enemies must be those who are strong. Those who can be strong must be those who employ human effort. Those who can employ human effort must be those who win the hearts of the people. Those who can win the hearts of the people must be those who have attained self-mastery. Those who have attained self-mastery must be those who are supple and weak. To be able to prevail over those inferior to oneself, when it comes to those equal to oneself, one must contend with suppleness. To prevail over those superior to oneself is a matter beyond calculation. Thus, those who can unite the many who cannot prevail achieve great victory.\n\n*Dao and Virtue*\n\nWenzi asked about the Dao. Laozi said: When learning is not precise and listening to the Dao is not deep, all who listen do so to attain wisdom, to perfect conduct, and to achieve merit and fame. If not precise, one will not be enlightened; if not deep, one will not be penetrating. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with the spirit; in middling learning, one listens with the heart; in inferior learning, one listens with the ears. To listen with the ears is to have learning in the skin; to listen with the heart is to have learning in the flesh; to listen with the spirit is to have learning in the marrow. Thus, if listening is not deep, knowledge will not be clear; if knowledge is not clear, one cannot exhaust its essence; if one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct will not be perfected. In all listening, the principle is to empty the heart, calm the self, diminish qi, be without excess, without thought, without anxiety, the eyes without reckless seeing, the ears without careless hearing. Concentrate the essence, accumulate and store it within; when the intent is full and complete, having attained it, one must firmly guard it and maintain it for long.\n\nThe Dao is the origin and source, having a beginning. It begins in suppleness and weakness, is completed in hardness and strength. It begins in brevity and fewness, is completed in multitude and length. A tree of ten spans begins with a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below. This is the Dao of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below; withdrawal is how one puts oneself behind; frugality is how one makes oneself small; diminution is how one makes oneself few. Humility leads to honor, withdrawal leads to precedence, frugality leads to abundance, diminution leads to greatness. This is what the Dao of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of virtue, the root of Heaven, the gate of fortune, the source upon which the myriad things depend for birth, for completion, for repose. The Dao is non-action, without form; internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and its affairs are established, it neighbors Heaven. Non-acting, yet nothing is left undone. None know its true nature, none know its reality, yet within it there is sincerity. When the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, the world submits; he long preserves the altars of soil and grain. When the feudal lords possess the Dao, the people are harmonious and peaceful; they do not lose their states. When the scholar-commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their persons and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without fighting. When the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contending. When affairs are conducted with the Dao, merit is achieved and fortune is obtained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness. When father and son possess the Dao, there is compassion and filial piety. When scholar-commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao there is harmony; without the Dao there is harshness. From this, it is observed that the Dao is fitting for all people in all circumstances.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune; when practiced to the utmost, the world submits. When the world submits, it is embraced. Thus, the emperor is the one to whom the world turns; the king is the one to whom the world goes. If the world does not turn to him nor go to him, he cannot be called emperor or king. Thus, the emperor and king who do not win the people cannot succeed; those who win the people but lose the Dao cannot maintain their position. Those who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and idle; they are haughty, self-important, self-displaying, and self-promoting; they hold to strength and hardness, create difficulties, accumulate grudges, initiate conflicts, and become the heads of disorder. When petty men practice this, they themselves receive great calamity; when great men practice this, their states are destroyed. The calamity reaches them lightly, their descendants deeply. There is no greater crime than being without the Dao; there is no deeper resentment than being without virtue. This is the way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice the Dao, though others be brave, cannot pierce them; though others be skillful, cannot strike them. Though they cannot be pierced or struck, and yet are still humiliated, it is not as good as making others, though brave, dare not pierce them, though skillful, dare not strike them. That they dare not is not because they lack the intent; it is not as good as making others lack the intent. That they lack the intent is because they have no thought of love or benefit; it is not as good as making all men and women under Heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit them. If this is so, there is no land where one is not lord, no office where one is not leader; under Heaven, none do not wish for their peace and benefit. Thus, those brave in daring will be killed; those brave in not daring will live.\n\nWenzi asked about virtue. Laozi said: To nurture, to nourish, to foster, to grow, to benefit all without discrimination, to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue. What is benevolence? To be above without boasting of one’s merit, to be below without shame for one’s faults; in great matters not to be arrogant, in small matters not to be negligent; to love universally without partiality, enduring without decline—this is called benevolence. What is righteousness? To be above is to assist the weak; to be below is to maintain integrity; when prosperous, not to indulge one’s desires; when poor, not to change one’s principles; to measure by the standard, follow the principle, not be partial or crooked—this is called righteousness. What is propriety? To be above is to be reverent and solemn; to be below is to be humble and respectful; to withdraw and yield, to be the female of the world, to stand in not daring, to establish in not being able—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue, those below follow commands; cultivating benevolence, those below do not contend; cultivating righteousness, those below are level and upright; cultivating propriety, those below are respectful. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure. Thus, that things are born is the Dao; that they grow is virtue; that they are loved is benevolence; that they are upright is righteousness; that they are respected is propriety. Without nurturing and nourishing, they cannot be fostered and grown; without compassion and love, they cannot be completed; without uprightness and correction, they cannot endure; without respect and honor, they cannot be valued. Thus, virtue is what the people value; benevolence is what the people cherish; righteousness is what the people fear; propriety is what the people respect. These four are the proper sequence of culture, by which the sage governs the myriad things.\n\nThe gentleman who lacks virtue will be resented by those below; who lacks benevolence will be contended against by those below; who lacks righteousness will be oppressed by those below; who lacks propriety will be thrown into chaos by those below. When these four constants are not established, it is called being without the Dao. There has never been one without the Dao who did not perish.\n\nLaozi said: In the age of utmost virtue, merchants find their markets convenient, farmers delight in their fields, great officers are secure in their positions, recluses cultivate their Dao, and the people enjoy their occupations. Thus, wind and rain do not break or snap grass and trees; none die prematurely; the Yellow River brings forth its diagram, the Luo River brings forth its writings. When the age declines, taxes and levies are without measure, killing and execution are without end; those who remonstrate are put to death, worthy scholars are suppressed. Thus, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, creeping things do not rest, and the wilds lack a hundred vegetables. Therefore, when the world is well-governed, even the foolish cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil in life. When utmost virtue and the Dao prevail, it is fate. Thus, life encounters fate and then can act; fate meets the time and then can be enlightened. There must be the right age and then there can be the right person.\n\nWenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom. Laozi said: \"To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. Thus, the sage constantly perceives where fortune and misfortune arise and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise constantly see fortune and misfortune take shape and choose their conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious in the heavenly Dao, thus knows where fortune and misfortune arise. The wise see their forms beforehand, thus know the gateway to fortune and misfortune. To hear before they arise is sagacity; to see before they take shape is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When a ruler favors righteousness, he trusts the times and relies on himself, discarding calculations and employing the foolish. With broad knowledge and shallow wisdom, to broadly provide with shallowness has never been possible. Relying solely on one’s own wisdom, failures must be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhausted strategies; favoring courage is the path to peril and ruin. Favoring bestowal leads to no fixed share; when the ruler’s share is not fixed, the people’s expectations know no end. If he heavily levies, he makes enemies of the people; if he takes little but gives much, his resources will have no limit. Thus, favoring bestowal is the path to inviting resentment. From this, we observe that wealth is insufficient to employ the Dao and arts; one must rely on clarity.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How did the kings of antiquity govern the world with the Dao?\" Laozi said: \"They grasped the One and practiced non-action, following the transformations of Heaven and Earth. The world is a great vessel; it cannot be grasped or acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Those who grasp see only the small; seeing only the small, they cannot accomplish the great. Non-action means maintaining stillness. By maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in great fullness without overflowing, dwelling in high nobility without arrogance—abiding in greatness without overflowing, full without deficiency; dwelling above without arrogance, high without peril; full without deficiency, thus long preserving wealth; high without peril, thus long preserving nobility. Wealth and nobility do not leave one’s person, and blessings extend to descendants. The kingly way of antiquity was complete in this.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The people have a Dao they all follow, laws they all uphold. Righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler grasps the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Dao is not for acting but for non-acting. The wise do not make virtue their affair; the brave do not make force their violence; the benevolent do not make position their favor. This may be called the One. The One is the Dao without bias, the root of the myriad things. If the ruler frequently changes the laws, the state frequently changes rulers. People, through their positions, express their likes and dislikes; the tasks of subordinates are fearful and cannot be fully managed. Thus, when a ruler loses the One, the chaos is worse than having no ruler. The ruler must grasp the One and then can unite the many.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"Is there a safeguard for the kingly way?\" Laozi said: \"The One alone.\" Wenzi said: \"In antiquity, some ruled with the Dao, others with arms. How is this the One?\" Laozi said: \"Those who ruled with the Dao did so through virtue; those who ruled with arms also did so through virtue. In the use of arms, there are five types: righteous arms, responsive arms, resentful arms, greedy arms, and arrogant arms. Punishing the violent and saving the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use arms, it is called responsive; contending over small matters, unable to conquer the heart, is called resentful; desiring others’ lands and coveting others’ wealth is called greedy; relying on the greatness of one’s state, priding oneself on the multitude of one’s people, and wishing to be seen as worthy by enemy states is called arrogant. Righteous arms bring kingship; responsive arms bring victory; resentful arms bring defeat; greedy arms bring death; arrogant arms bring destruction. This is the heavenly Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Abandoning the Dao and relying on wisdom leads to peril; discarding calculations and employing talent leads to困. Thus, maintaining one’s place and following principle, one does not grieve over losses nor rejoice over gains. Success is not what one acts for; gain is not what one seeks. Incoming, there is receiving but no taking; outgoing, there is bestowal but no giving. Following spring to give life, following autumn to kill—what is given life owes no gratitude; what is killed bears no resentment. Thus, one is safeguarded by the Dao.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How does a ruler gain the people’s joyful hearts?\" Laozi said: \"Be like the rivers and seas—bland and without flavor, inexhaustible in use. Put the small before the great. Those who wish to rise above others must first place their words below them; those who wish to precede others must first place themselves behind. To win the world, one must emulate its joy and love, advance its benevolence and righteousness without harshness. Dwelling above, the people do not find one burdensome; standing in front, the multitude is not harmed. The world joyfully pushes one forward without weariness. Though distant lands and different customs, even the flying insects and creeping things, none are not loving and intimate. Without going, there is nowhere unreached; without journeying, there is nowhere not arrived. Thus, one is honored by the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Holding to the world’s laws and registers to oppose transmitted customs is like gluing the pegs when tuning a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexible changes, seeing forms and applying what is fitting. As ages differ, affairs change; as times shift, customs transform. Discussing the age, establishing laws, acting according to the times—kings of high antiquity had different laws and standards, not because antiquity and the present are opposed, but because their tasks and duties differed. Thus, one does not model after already established laws but models after that by which laws are made, moving with transformations. The sage’s laws can be observed, but the reasons for their creation cannot be traced; his words can be heard, but the reasons for his speech cannot be discerned. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, considered the myriad things as insignificant, equated death and life, and harmonized with changes. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the feelings of the myriad things. Above, they befriended the Dao; below, they befriended transformation. Now, if one wishes to learn their Dao but does not attain their clarity and mysterious sagacity, holding to their laws and registers and enacting their statutes and decrees, one certainly cannot govern.\"\n\nWenzi asked about governance. Laozi said: \"Guide them with the Dao, nourish them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not apply force. Diminish and grasp the One. Have no place to profit, no desires to be seen. Be square without cutting, sharp without wounding. Be without pride, without boasting. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will attach; nourish them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not apply force, and the people will be simple. Not displaying worthiness is frugality; not applying force is humility. Below, gather them; with bribes, take from them. Be frugal to preserve oneself; be humble to secure oneself. Without gathering below, they scatter; without nourishing, they turn away. Displaying worthiness leads to contention; applying force leads to resentment. Scattering weakens the state’s power; turning away means the ruler loses authority. Contention leads to轻易 wrongdoing; resentment of superiors endangers position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Dao is safeguarded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Words from above are used below; words from below are used above. Words from above are constantly used; words from below are flexibly used. Only the sage can know flexible words and yet be certain, meet expectations and yet be appropriate. In the world, the highest conduct is to be upright and prove the father trustworthy, to be faithful and die for the woman. Who can value this? Thus, the sage discusses the right and wrong of affairs, bending and extending with them, without constant standards. When the ruler is upright, he is the named lord; when he is indulgent, he is seized by his father. Circumstances compel this. Flexibility is how the sage uniquely perceives what goes against first and then accords. What accords first and then goes against does not know flexibility. Not knowing flexibility, good reverses to ugliness.\"\n\nWenzi asked, \"Master, in your teaching, none but the Dao and virtue can govern the world. Yet among the kings of high antiquity who inherited their legacy, some were without the Dao, yet passed their years without calamity or ruin—by what Dao was this so?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own life, yet the fullness of that life varies in thickness and thinness. The world at times sees states perish and houses break apart, not for lack of the Dao and virtue. Where the Dao and virtue are present, one rises early and retires late without slackening, trembling and vigilant, ever fearing peril and ruin. Where the Dao and virtue are absent, desires run rampant and indolence sets in—ruin comes without warning. If Jie and Zhou had followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even the worthy Tang and Wu would have had no merit to establish. The Dao and virtue are that by which all things nurture and sustain one another, rear and foster one another, cherish and love one another, respect and honor one another.\n\nEven the deaf worm, though dull, does not harm what it loves. If truly the people of the world all harbored hearts of benevolence and love, from where would calamity and disaster arise? Those without the Dao yet free from harm—benevolence has not yet vanished, and righteousness has not yet perished. Though benevolence has not vanished and righteousness has not perished, if the feudal lords slight their superiors, the court will not be reverent. Even if they do not yet rebel, when benevolence is extinguished and righteousness is lost, the feudal lords will turn against one another, the strong will oppress the weak, the great will encroach upon the small, and the people will make attack and assault their trade. Disasters will arise, chaos will erupt—ruin will come without delay. How could one expect to escape harm?\n\nLaozi said, \"When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people give birth to deceit. When the ruler is meddlesome, the subjects multiply their guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To generate affairs from affairs and then use affairs to halt affairs is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate trouble from cleverness and then use cleverness to guard against it is like stirring water and seeking its clarity.\n\nLaozi said, \"If the ruler favors benevolence, he rewards those without merit and releases those with crimes. If he favors punishment, he dismisses those with merit and implicates the innocent. Without favor or aversion, he executes without resentment and bestows without claiming virtue—level as the plumb line, straight as the marking cord, his person uninvolved in affairs, like heaven, like earth. What does not cover and bear all is harmonious and unified—this is the lord. What distinguishes and executes is the law. When the people receive execution without resentment or regret, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said, \"In the world, right and wrong have no fixed standard. Each age affirms what it deems good and rejects what it deems bad. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but seek what accords with themselves. They do not reject what is perverse but reject what opposes their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and dwell in it, choose what is wrong and cast it aside, I would not know the world’s so-called right and wrong. Thus, governing a great state is like cooking a small fish—do not stir it. Those who rush to accord speak words that hit the mark and gain intimacy, yet if their persons are distant and their plans apt, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await things, how would I know what the world follows to gauge me? If I were to hasten along with the俗, it would be like fleeing the rain—there is nowhere one does not get drenched. If one’s desire lies in emptiness, one cannot be empty. But that which does not strive for emptiness and is empty of itself—this is what one desires, and nothing fails to come to it.\n\nThus, one who is penetrating in the Dao is like the axle of a cart: it does not move itself yet, with the hub, reaches a thousand *li*, turning on the boundless plain. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao, returning to the ultimate, unchanging to await change, moving yet without action.\n\nLaozi said, \"Those who frequently wage war and repeatedly triumph will surely see their state perish. Frequent war exhausts the people; repeated triumph makes the ruler arrogant. To employ an arrogant ruler to command an exhausted people and not have the state perish is rare indeed. When the ruler is arrogant, he indulges himself; when he indulges, he reaches excess. When the people are exhausted, they resent; when they resent, they reach the limit of their thoughts. When both above and below reach their limits, and the state does not perish—this has never been. Thus, success achieved, the body retreats—this is the Dao of heaven.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi, \"I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. Now, though worthy men possess the Dao, they encounter an age of excess and disorder. With the authority of one man, how can they transform a people long steeped in chaos?\"\n\nWenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue rectify the perverse to make them upright, rouse the disordered to make them well-ordered, transform excess and decay to restore simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world is at peace—this hinges on one man. The ruler is the people’s teacher. What is above serves as the model for what is below. If what is above is refined, what is below emulates it. If what is above possesses the Dao and virtue, what is below possesses benevolence and righteousness. When what is below possesses benevolence and righteousness, there will be no age of excess and disorder.\n\nAccumulated virtue completes kingship; accumulated resentment completes ruin. Accumulated stones form mountains; accumulated waters form seas. Without accumulation, nothing comes to completion. Those who accumulate the Dao and virtue—heaven grants them aid, earth assists them, gods and spirits support them. The phoenix soars in their courtyards; the qilin roams their outskirts; the jiao-dragon lodges in their ponds. Thus, to govern the world with the Dao is the world’s virtue. To govern the world without the Dao is the world’s bane. To make an enemy of the world with one man—though one might wish for longevity, it cannot be attained.\"\n\nYao and Shun flourished by this; Jie and Zhou perished by this. King Ping said, \"I reverently heed your command.\"\n\n**On Supreme Virtue**\nLaozi said: The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is ordered, the hundred limbs are all at peace; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred limbs are all in chaos. Thus, when one’s person is ordered, the limbs and body forget one another; when the state is ordered, ruler and ministers forget one another.\n\nLaozi said: Learning from Chang Cong, one sees the tongue endure while teeth decay and thus guards softness. Gazing at the eaves, one retreats and follows the river to observe reflections, thereby knowing to hold back. Thus, the sage embraces emptiness and non-action, follows the constant, holds back rather than advances—like piling firewood, the last placed is on top. **[Chang Cong was Laozi’s teacher.]**\n\nLaozi said: The ringing bell destroys itself with sound; the tallow candle consumes itself with light. The tiger and leopard are hunted for their patterns; the gibbon and monkey are trapped for their agility. Thus, the valiant and martial perish by their strength; the eloquent and clever are ensnared by their wit. Those who rely on partial knowledge are perceptive in one matter but blind in another; those who claim omniscience through knowledge do not know what lies beyond knowledge. Thus, one may be bold in a single skill and discerning in a single phrase—sufficient for subtle persuasion, but not for broad response.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao takes non-being as its essence. Gazing at it, one sees no form; listening to it, one hears no sound. It is called \"profound and obscure\"—these terms describe the Dao but are not the Dao itself. The Dao lies in inward reflection and self-examination. Thus, one does not become slightly deluded or greatly confused, nor slightly wise or greatly foolish. Nothing reflects more clearly than still water, for it preserves inner stillness and does not drift outward. The moon’s light is eclipsed by the sun; shadows cannot contend with radiance. The branch cannot surpass the trunk, nor the twig the branch. When the top is heavy and the bottom light, overturning is inevitable. A single abyss does not harbor two jiao-dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. When one is settled, two contend. Jade lies in the mountain, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the banks do not wither. The earthworm, though lacking strong sinews or sharp claws, eats dust above and drinks from the yellow springs below—all by focusing its mind singularly.\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water reveals the pupil. Turbidity brings harm: the Yellow River cannot reflect Mount Tai. Orchids and angelicas do not lose their fragrance for lack of wear; boats do not sink in rivers and seas for lack of passengers. The noble person practices the Dao not for want of recognition but because it is the nature of his being.\n\nEntering the turbid from clarity brings distress and disgrace; entering the clear from turbidity brings ruin and collapse. When heaven’s two qi converge, a rainbow forms; when earth’s two qi converge, springs erupt; when a person’s two qi converge, illness arises. Yin and yang cannot remain constant—now winter, now summer; the moon knows not day, the sun knows not night. Where rivers are wide, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall; where the land is vast, virtue is profound. Thus, fish cannot be caught without bait, nor beasts summoned with empty vessels. Where mountains harbor fierce beasts, the forest remains uncut; where gardens shelter stinging insects, the mallows and beans remain unpicked. A state with worthy ministers repels invasions a thousand *li* away. Those who accord with the Dao are like an axle turning within the hub—unchanged by itself, yet conveying one a thousand *li*, ever returning to the beginning, revolving in the boundless source.\n\nThus, what is gained by elevating the crooked alongside the straight? Better to elevate the straight alone and not the crooked. Once, a bird was about to arrive, and a net was spread to await it. The bird was caught by a single mesh of the net. Now, if one were to make a net of a single mesh, there would be no time one could catch a bird. Thus, some matters cannot be prearranged, and some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment.\n\nTo catch fish, first clear the valley; to seek birds, first raise the trees. Water gathers, and fish assemble; trees flourish, and birds gather. Those who obtain fish do not drag them into the deep; those who obtain monkeys do not carry them up the trees. Release them where they find advantage, and their needs are met. What they tread is shallow, yet they await what they do not tread before they can walk. What the mind knows is limited, yet it awaits what it does not know before it can attain clarity. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. When lips are gone, teeth grow cold. When river waters run deep, soil remains on the mountains. When water is still, it is clear; when clear, it is level; when level, it is smooth; when smooth, it reflects the forms of things. Forms cannot coexist, and thus can serve as standards. Leaves fall when the wind shakes them; water grows turbid when things disturb it. The roundness of a jade disk is the work of the grinding wheel; the sharpness of a blade is the work of the whetstone.\n\nThe sharpness of Moye and Yeyan blades is the work of grinding and honing. The thoroughbred and the swift steed may reach a thousand *li* without flying, and without provisions they do not hunger. When the cunning hare is caught, the hunting dog is cooked; when the high-flying birds are gone, the fine bow is put away. Fame achieved and success attained, one retreats—such is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nAnger arises from non-anger; action emerges from non-action. Seeing in the absence of forms, one obtains true vision; hearing in the absence of sound, one obtains true hearing. Flying birds return to their homeland; hares run back to their burrows; foxes die with their heads toward the hills—each clings to its place of origin. Water and fire are mutually averse, yet the tripod stands between them, blending the five flavors into harmony. Bones and flesh love one another, but slanderers drive wedges between them, endangering father and son.\n\nDogs and swine eat from any vessel, and their bodies grow fat—yet they draw near to death. The phoenix soars a thousand *ren* high, yet none can reach it; the mallet may shatter a hundred layers of armor, yet it cannot split its own handle. The eye sees a hundred paces away, yet cannot see its own lashes. Build upon height to make a mountain, and it stands firm without peril; delve into depth to make an abyss, and it grows profound, drawing fish and turtles to it. Ditches and ponds overflow when flooded and dry up in drought, but the source of rivers and seas is deep and never exhausted.\n\nThe turtle has no ears, yet its eyes cannot be obscured—so keen is its clarity. The blind have no eyes, yet their ears...\n\nThe blind may lack eyes, yet their ears cannot be obscured—so keen is their hearing. Can the turbid, swirling waters cleanse my feet? Can the clear, rippling stream wash my cap strings? The mulberry bark that becomes fine silk may be woven into a crown or a mourning cap—worn on the head or trampled underfoot. The strength of metal prevails over wood: a single blade cannot fell a forest. The force of earth prevails over water: a handful of soil cannot dam a river. The might of water prevails over fire: a ladleful cannot quench a cartload of burning kindling. Winter brings thunder, summer brings hail, yet cold and heat do not alter their seasons. Frost and snow vanish at sunrise, melting away—easily overturned, easily toppled, easily aided, easily drenched. Orchids and angelica, though fragrant, cannot withstand the frost; toads ward off weapons, and their longevity peaks at the full moon of the fifth month. Those who dissipate their essence perish early; blossoms that bloom out of season cannot be eaten. Between the tongue and the teeth, which decays first? Between the plumb line and the arrow, which is straighter?\n\nIt is form that bends the shadow, sound that muddies the echo. One afflicted by the same illness as the dead cannot be a skilled physician; one who follows the path of a fallen state cannot devise loyal strategies. Let a musician play the *yu* or an artisan shape its holes—though they strike the notes perfectly, they cannot be entrusted with judging the ruler’s appearance. The deaf do not sing, for they have no joy in it; the blind do not gaze, for they cannot engage with the world. Walking through a forest, one cannot take the straight path; traversing perilous terrain, one cannot tread the plumb line.\n\nWithin the seas, all things arise, and thus the great can be vast. The sun does not rise twice; the fox does not have two alphas; the divine dragon does not pair; the fierce beast does not herd; the raptor does not mate. Without rafters, the sun’s wheel cannot be shaded; without spokes, it cannot race swiftly—yet rafters and spokes alone are not to be relied upon. Draw the bow and shoot: without the bowstring, the arrow cannot be loosed. The act of shooting is but one-tenth of the arrow’s flight. A starving horse in the stable makes no sound, but toss fodder beside it, and its competitive spirit arises.\n\nA three-inch tube, though bottomless, cannot fill the world, yet stop it with a plug, and it holds a hundred *dou*. Follow the plumb line to cut, and you will not err; hang the balance to measure, and you will not miss. Suspend the ancient methods to assess, and though they may sometimes succeed, the staff and cangue are applied at their proper times. To act in accordance with principle is called judgment; to act contrary to it is called chaos.\n\nThe farmer toils while the gentleman is nourished; the fool speaks while the wise choose. What is seen clearly is handled like jade and stone; what is dimly perceived must be pondered. A hundred stars’ brightness does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows thrown open do not match the illumination of one door. The viper cannot serve as feet; the tiger cannot serve as wings.\n\nNow, a six-foot mat: the mediocre may lie upon it and stretch beyond its bounds, while the exceptional may stand and surpass it—talent and circumstance differ in their application. Those who assist in sacrifices taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights suffer wounds. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites the thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon strive to shine, yet floating clouds obscure them. The river seeks clarity, yet silt muddies it. The orchid aspires to flourish, yet autumn winds ruin it. Human nature desires balance, yet desires harm it. Shield your eyes from dust, yet you cannot avoid specks; polish gold and carve tortoiseshell—only the worthy wear them as pendants. Earth and soil cover the land, yet only the capable find wealth in them.\n\nThus, to the weak, gold and jade are not as good as a foot of plain silk. A hollow hub stands at the center, and thirty spokes each exert their strength—if one axle alone were to enter, all the spokes would be cast aside. How could near or far be reached? The orange and pomelo have their native soil; reeds and rushes grow in clusters. Beasts with the same feet travel together; birds with the same wings soar together. To survey the Nine Provinces’ lands without journeying a thousand *li*, without grasping the roots of governance and instruction, and yet aspire to rule over the myriad people—this is difficult indeed.\n\nThe fierce are hunted; the cautious are shot. Thus, the purest white seems tainted; the greatest virtue seems insufficient. The gentleman has wine; the petty man lashes the jar. Though one may not admire it, it can still shame others. Human nature is such that plain cloth and silk, though shot through, become armor—what is inconvenient is cast aside to seize what is advantageous.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub, each fitting its own mortise without intrusion—just as ministers each guard their duties. One who uses people well is like the centipede’s many legs, numerous yet unobstructed, or like the tongue and teeth, hard and soft grinding without harming each other. Stone is born hard; angelica is born fragrant. The young may possess it, but the old grow ever wiser. Support and lifting, gratitude and yielding, gain and loss, promise and self—these differ by a thousand *li*. Those reborn do not bear blossoms; those who bloom too early wither before the frost. Defile your nose, powder your forehead; a rotting rat lies in the hall, yet you burn incense within. Enter water and hate to get wet; cling to stench yet seek fragrance—even the skilled cannot craft this.\n\nWinter ice can be shattered; summer wood can be knotted—timing is hard to grasp yet easy to lose. A tree in full vigor may be harvested all day, and it will regrow; but when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night. The target is set, and arrows gather; the forest is lush, and axes enter—not by summons, but by the force of circumstance. The nursing pup bites the tiger; the crouching hen strikes the fox—favor is bestowed without measuring strength.\n\nThose who climb for profit will drown in it; those who drown for profit must be drowned by it. A boat can float or sink—fools do not know enough to stop. The swift steed may be driven forward but not urged on, pulled back but not halted. A ruler who does not seek the Dao is like this. Water, though level, must have waves; the balance, though true, must have discrepancies. A foot, though even, must have flaws. Without compass and square, one cannot determine circle and square; without plumb line and level, one cannot correct crooked and straight. Yet even those who use compass and square must have the heart of compass and square.\n\nMount Tai’s height may double, yet it cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair may be examined closely. Bamboo and wood contain fire, but without drilling, they will not smoke; earth holds water, but without digging, it will not emerge. An arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*; half-steps, unceasing, carry the lame turtle a thousand *li*. Pile up earth without rest, and hills and mountains form. Standing by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning to weave a net.\n\nFirst tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek speed; first establish trust, then seek ability. The finest smith cannot melt wood; the skilled carpenter cannot carve ice. There are things beyond human power—the gentleman does not dwell on them. Make people cross the river, and the river may be made wave-free; but to make the river itself waveless is impossible. The saying goes: \"The innocent pot will not fall into the well.\"\n\nThose who criticize my conduct seek my friendship; those who disparage my goods seek to trade with me. One move in chess does not reveal wisdom; one pluck of the bowstring does not make a lament. Now, a burning coal: pick it up, and it scorches the fingers—so close is the harm. A hundredweight of incense burns together, yet step ten paces away, and its scent does not kill—same substance, different accumulation.\n\nA six-foot mat: lie upon it, and even the mediocre may overstep its bounds; stand upon it, and even the exceptional may not surpass it—circumstance and application differ. Those who assist in sacrifices taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights suffer wounds. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites the thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon strive to shine, yet floating clouds obscure them. The river seeks clarity, yet silt muddies it. The orchid aspires to flourish, yet autumn winds ruin it. Human nature desires balance, yet desires harm it. Shield your eyes from dust, yet you cannot avoid specks.\n\nPolish gold and carve tortoiseshell—only the worthy wear them as pendants. Earth and soil cover the land, yet only the capable find wealth in them. Thus, to the weak, gold and jade are not as good as a foot of plain silk. A hollow hub stands at the center, and thirty spokes each exert their strength—if one axle alone were to enter, all the spokes would be cast aside. How could near or far be reached? The orange and pomelo have their native soil; reeds and rushes grow in clusters. Beasts with the same feet travel together; birds with the same wings soar together. To survey the Nine Provinces’ lands without journeying a thousand *li*, without grasping the roots of governance and instruction, and yet aspire to rule over the myriad people—this is difficult indeed.\n\nThose who know glory must also know sorrow and weariness. Above are silks and fine fabrics; below must be coarse hemp and sackcloth. The greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the taller the mountain, the broader its base.\n\nLaozi said: The drum does not conceal sound, thus it can produce sound. The mirror does not obscure form, thus it can reflect form. Metal and stone possess sound, yet without movement, they do not ring. The flute and panpipes possess tone, yet without blowing, they remain silent. Therefore, the sage inwardly conceals and does not initiate; when affairs come, they govern them; when things arrive, they respond. The heavens move without cease, ending only to begin anew—thus they endure long. The wheel turns where it should, thus it travels far. The heavens move as one without deviation, thus they commit no error.\n\nHeaven’s qi descends; earth’s qi ascends. Yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are harmonized as one. The noble employ affairs, and the petty fade away—such is the Dao of heaven and earth. If heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, if yin and yang do not communicate, the myriad things do not flourish. The petty gain power, the noble fade away, the five grains are not planted, and virtue is inwardly concealed—this is the Dao of heaven, which reduces excess to supplement deficiency; the Dao of earth, which lowers the high to raise the low; the Dao of spirits, which curbs arrogance to humble the exalted; and the Dao of man, where the abundant do not bestow. The sage’s Dao is lowly, and none can surpass it.\n\nThe heavens are bright, and only then can they illuminate the four directions. When the ruler is enlightened and the ministers are enlightened, the realm is at peace. When the realm possesses fourfold brightness, it can endure long. To make its bestowal clear is to make its transformation clear.\n\nThe Dao of heaven patterns; the Dao of earth orders. Harmony is made of oneness, and timing is made to serve—thus the myriad things are completed. This is called the Dao. The great Dao is smooth and unobstructed, not far from the self. Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true. Cultivate it in things, and its virtue does not cease. Heaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nurture them, giving without taking—thus the spirit returns to it.\n\nTo give without taking is the highest virtue. Therefore, in possessing virtue, none is loftier than heaven.\n\nThe marsh is the lowest of the low, just as heaven is the highest of the high. The sage models this: when honor and humility are ordered, the world is settled. Earth bears the myriad things and makes them grow, giving and taking—thus bones and skeletons return to it. To give and take is lesser virtue. Yet lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it is without flaw. Earth receives heaven’s mandate and thereby establishes tranquility. When earth is tranquil, the myriad things take form. Earth is vast and thick, gathering the myriad things in settled tranquility. Nothing is not borne, nothing is not contained. Earth’s depth and thickness gather springs and waters. Earth’s Dao is square and broad, and thus it endures long. The sage models this: his virtue contains all. When yin yields to yang, the myriad things flourish; when yang returns to yin, the myriad things rest. When things flourish, nothing is not provided for; when things rest, nothing is not at peace. When things are at peace, nothing is not well-ordered.\n\nWhen yin harms things, yang naturally withdraws; when yin advances, yang retreats. When petty men gain power, noble men avoid harm—this is the way of heaven. When yang qi moves, the myriad things relax and find their place. Thus the sage follows the yang Dao. Those who follow things, things follow in turn; those who oppose things, things oppose in turn. Therefore, one does not lose the nature and disposition of things. When marshes and wetlands are full, the myriad things mature; when marshes and wetlands dry, the myriad things wither. Thus when rain and moisture do not flow, the world becomes barren. Yang rises and then returns below, becoming the master of the myriad things. It does not long abide above, and thus it can end and begin anew, enduring long. Because it endures long, it becomes the mother of the world. Yang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who could transform without first accumulating. Thus the sage is cautious in what he accumulates. When yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow plump; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Therefore, when kings and lords esteem the yang Dao, the myriad things flourish; when they esteem the yin Dao, the world perishes. If yang does not descend, yin cannot complete the myriad things; if the ruler does not descend to his ministers, virtuous transformation does not flow. Thus when the ruler descends to his ministers, wisdom and clarity prevail; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue.\n\nThe sun emerges from the earth, and the myriad things flourish; kings and lords stand above the people, illuminating the Dao and its virtue. The sun enters the earth, and the myriad things rest; petty men stand above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. When thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The great man’s bestowal of virtue is like this. The movement of yin and yang has constant measure; the great man’s movement does not exceed things. Thunder shakes the earth, and the myriad things relax; wind sways the trees, and grasses and trees wither. When the great man removes evil and pursues good, the people do not wander far. Thus the people have departures and arrivals: departing from great faults and arriving at minor improvements. When wind does not move, fire does not emerge; when the great man does not speak, petty men have nothing to recount. When fire emerges, it must await fuel; when the great man speaks, he must be trustworthy. With trustworthiness and truth, what endeavor does not succeed?\n\nRiver waters run deep, and soil gathers on mountains; hills and mounds rise and fall into the abyss. When yang qi flourishes, it transforms into yin; when yin qi flourishes, it transforms into yang. Thus desire must not be filled, joy must not be extreme. Do not let anger give rise to vicious words; do not let wrath produce harsh expressions. This is called calculated gain. Fire flames upward, water flows downward—the sage’s Dao seeks harmony between them. When the sage leans toward yang, the world is harmonious and united; when he leans toward yin, the world is drowned and submerged.\n\nLaozi said: “Accumulate thinness to become thick; accumulate lowness to become high.” The noble man daily strives to achieve brilliance; the petty man daily hastens toward disgrace. Their rise and fall, though not yet visible, are manifest: he who sees good as if he cannot reach it, and lodges evil as if it were inauspicious, even if he errs while moving toward good, will incur no resentment. But he who does not move toward good, even if loyal, will attract misfortune. Thus resenting others is not as good as resenting oneself; exhorting others is not as good as exhorting oneself. Voice is self-summoned; harmony is self-sought. Fame is self-declared; position is self-assigned. There is nothing that is not of the self. Wielding a sharp point to stab, grasping a blade to strike—why resent others? Thus the noble man is cautious in his defenses.\n\nThe myriad things carry yin on their backs and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Harmony dwells in the center. Thus fruits of trees grow from the heart; seeds of grasses grow from their defenses. Eggs and wombs are born from the center. Those not born from eggs or wombs require time. When the land is level, water does not flow; when weight is balanced, the scale does not tilt. The generation and transformation of things arise from resonance.\n\nLaozi said: “When mountains reach their height, clouds and rain arise; when waters reach their depth, dragons are born. When the noble man attains his Dao, his virtue and beneficence flow forth.” Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown. Sowing millet will not yield sorghum; sowing resentment will bring no return of virtue.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao may be weak, may be strong; may be yielding, may be firm; may be yin, may be yang; may be obscure, may be luminous. It can embrace heaven and earth, can respond to the boundless. What is known of it is shallow; what is unknown, profound. What is known lies without; what is unknown, within. What is known is coarse; what is unknown, refined. Knowing it, one does not know; not knowing, one knows it. Who knows that knowing is not-knowing, and not-knowing is knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Who knows the formless form?\n\nThus, when all under heaven know goodness as goodness, it is no longer good. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n\nWenzi asked: Can one speak subtly?\nLaozi said: Why not? Only those who know speech are meant.\nThose who know speech do not speak with words. Those who chase fish get wet; those who pursue beasts run—not for pleasure. Thus, the highest speech abandons speech; the highest action abandons action. What shallow minds contend over is trivial.\n\nSpeech has its source; affairs have their lord. To feign ignorance is why I am not understood.\n\nWenzi asked: Is there a method for governing a state?\nLaozi said: Now, those pulling a cart call out *xiehu* in front, and those behind respond—this is the song that encourages their strength. Though the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu may be fine, it does not match the meaning of this. In governing a state, propriety lies in ritual, not in ornate debate. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao has no norm, yet it may serve as the norm. It is like forests and mountains, which may serve as timber, yet timber does not equal forests and mountains; forests and mountains do not equal clouds and rain; clouds and rain do not equal yin and yang; yin and yang do not equal harmony; harmony does not equal the Dao. The Dao is what is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. Those who grasp its meaning can shape and transform all between heaven and earth.\n\nLaozi said: When the sage establishes teachings and enacts governance, he must examine their beginning and end, see their origins and outcomes. Thus, when the people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know machinery, substance declines.\n\nThe zither does not sound, yet its twenty-five strings each respond to their tones. The axle does not turn of itself, yet its thirty spokes each rotate with their force. Only when there is slack and tension can music be made; only when there is labor and rest can distant journeys be reached. Thus, what has sound is made by what is soundless; what turns is made by what does not turn.\n\nThe ways of high and low differ. When governance is easy, disorder arises. Those in high position with great Dao succeed in great matters; those with small Dao bring misfortune. Minor virtue harms righteousness; minor goodness harms the Dao; petty eloquence harms governance; harsh severity injures virtue. Great uprightness is not perilous, so the people are easily guided. Supreme governance is leisurely, so the people do not harm. Utmost loyalty returns to simplicity, so the people do not conceal or feign.\n\nLaozi said: When laws of mutual implication are established, the hundred clans resent them. When decrees to reduce ranks are enforced, meritorious ministers rebel. Thus, those skilled in the traces of brush and knife do not know the root of order and chaos; those practiced in battlefield formations do not know the authority of temple strategy. The sage first secures blessings within the inner passes and considers calamities beyond the unseen. The foolish are deluded by small gains and forget great harm. Thus, affairs may benefit the small but harm the great; gain here may mean loss there. Therefore, nothing is greater than loving others in benevolence, nothing greater than knowing others in wisdom. Loving others leaves no resentment; knowing others leaves no disordered governance.\n\nLaozi said: The great overflow of rivers and lakes does not last beyond three days. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last from dawn to dusk. Those who do not accumulate virtue without worry will perish when their time comes. Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, misfortune into fortune. The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use.\n\nLaozi said: Tranquility and harmony are human nature. Rules and measures are the systems of affairs. Knowing human nature, one nurtures oneself without error. Knowing the systems of affairs, one’s actions are not disordered. Issuing a single command disperses without end; gathering a single thread is called the mind. Seeing the root, one knows the branches; grasping the one, one responds to the ten thousand—this is called *shu*. Knowing where to act, knowing where to go, knowing what to ride, knowing where to stop—this is called the Dao. Making others esteem and praise oneself is the power of the mind; making others belittle and slander oneself is the mind’s fault.\n\nWords spoken from the mouth cannot be forbidden by others; actions taken nearby cannot be forbidden from afar. Affairs are difficult to accomplish and easy to ruin; reputations are difficult to establish and easy to destroy. People all take small harms lightly and treat minor matters carelessly, leading to great calamity. When misfortune arrives, people bring it upon themselves; when fortune comes, people complete it themselves. Misfortune and fortune share the same door; benefit and harm dwell as neighbors. Without utmost clarity, none can distinguish them. Thus, wisdom and foresight are the doors and windows of fortune and misfortune; movement and stillness are the pivot and mechanism of benefit and harm. One cannot but examine them carefully.\n\nLaozi said: All know the mechanisms of order and chaos, yet none know the tools of preserving life. Thus, the sage discusses the world and acts accordingly, weighs affairs and plans accordingly. The sage can be yin, can be yang; can be yielding, can be firm; can be weak, can be strong. Following the times in movement and stillness, relying on resources to achieve success, observing things’ going and knowing their return, handling one affair and examining its changes—then one acts accordingly. Thus, one may practice this all one’s life without distress. Some affairs can be spoken but not done; some can be done but not spoken; some are easy to do but hard to complete; some are hard to complete but easy to ruin. What can be done but not spoken is taking and abandoning; what can be spoken but not done is deceit and falsehood; what is easy to do but hard to complete is affairs; what is hard to complete but easy to ruin is reputation. These four are what the sage attends to, what the enlightened alone perceive.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao respects the small and subtle, moves without losing the moment. In archery, one must be cautious; calamity will not then grow. Calculate blessings without reaching them; consider misfortunes beyond them. On the same day, those sheltered by frost are not harmed. The foolish, with preparation, share the same success as the wise. Accumulating love becomes fortune; accumulating hatred becomes misfortune. All know how to rescue calamity, but none know how to prevent calamity from arising. Preventing calamity is easier than rescuing it, yet people do not strive to prevent calamity but strive to rescue it. Even the divine cannot devise plans for this. The origins of calamity and misfortune are boundless. The sage dwells deeply to avoid calamity, remains silent to await the moment. The petty person, not knowing the gates of fortune and misfortune, acts and falls into punishment. Though they take every precaution, it is not enough to preserve themselves. Thus, the superior person first avoids calamity, then seeks benefit; first distances disgrace, then pursues fame. Therefore, the sage always acts beyond the formless and does not dwell on what is already formed. Thus, calamity and misfortune have no way to arrive; slander and praise cannot stain.\n\nLaozi said: In the Dao of all people, the heart should be small, the aspirations great, wisdom round, conduct square, abilities many, and affairs few.\n\nWhat is called a small heart is to consider calamity before it arises, guard against misfortune, be cautious of the minute, and not dare to indulge one’s desires. Aspirations should be great, encompassing the myriad states, unifying disparate customs, with right and wrong converging like spokes toward the hub. Wisdom is round when it has no beginning or end, flowing boundlessly like a deep spring that never runs dry. Conduct is square when one stands upright without bending, remains unsullied like plain white silk, and does not alter one’s principles in poverty nor indulge one’s will in success. Many abilities mean possessing both civil and martial skills, with movement and stillness conforming to propriety, every action and decision perfectly fitting its place. Few affairs mean grasping the essentials to harmonize with the many, holding to simplicity to govern the vast, and abiding in stillness to restrain restlessness.\n\nThus, a small heart forbids even the minute; great aspirations embrace all; round wisdom knows all; square conduct refrains from all; many abilities govern all; few affairs simplify what one holds. Therefore, the sage does not neglect even the smallest good, nor does he overlook even the most subtle transgression. He does not employ shamans or diviners, yet spirits dare not precede him—this may be called the utmost nobility. Yet he trembles with caution, day by day growing more vigilant, thus achieving unity through non-action.\n\nThe foolish person’s wisdom is already meager, yet the affairs he undertakes are many; thus, every action leads to exhaustion. Governing and teaching through proper means is easy and must succeed; governing and teaching through perverse means is difficult and must fail. To abandon what is easy and certain for what is difficult and doomed—this is the result of folly.\n\nLaozi said: Fortune arises subtly and continuously; calamity emerges chaotically and tumultuously. The workings of fortune and misfortune are imperceptible, yet the sage sees their beginning and end—thus, they cannot but be examined. The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself but for the state. Those who please him yet bring no benefit to the state receive no reward; those who oppose him yet benefit the state incur no punishment. Thus, one who carries righteousness fittingly is called a noble person; one who abandons righteousness fittingly is called a petty person. Those who attain understanding without toil, or toil without harm, or are harmed yet still toil—such were the ancients, who savored without ceasing. The people of today cease without savoring. When Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi sighed; when Lu buried a man with wooden figurines, Confucius lamented. Seeing the beginning, they knew the end.\n\nLaozi said: Benevolence is what people admire; righteousness is what people esteem. Yet those who are admired and esteemed may perish or lose their states—this is because they do not accord with the times. Thus, one who knows benevolence and righteousness but not the weight of the age does not attain the Dao. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is not the Dao. Thus, good and bad are the same, praise and blame lie in custom; action and inaction depend on the times. Knowing Heaven’s workings and understanding human conduct—this is how one navigates the world. Knowing Heaven but not people leaves one unable to engage with the world; knowing people but not Heaven leaves one unable to wander with the Dao. A steadfast will and compliant nature make one strong, but if one’s body is enslaved by things, yin and yang consume it.\n\nThe person who attains the Dao transforms externally yet remains unchanged internally. External transformation allows one to know others; internal constancy preserves the self. Thus, one maintains an unchanging principle within while externally adapting and moving with things, never falling into error. What is prized in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation. Clinging to a single virtue or promoting one action, though it may bring fulfillment, is still to be bound by petty preferences and obstructed from the great Dao.\n\nThe Dao is still and empty, not acting upon things, nor acting for itself. Thus, when affairs proceed in accord with the Dao, it is not the Dao that acts—it is the Dao’s application. What the Dao extends to—the heavens and earth that cover and bear, the sun and moon that illuminate, the yin and yang that warm, the rain and dew that moisten, the virtue and power that support—all share a single harmony.\n\nTherefore, one who can bear the great circle walks the great square; one who mirrors the great clarity sees the great brightness; one who establishes great peace dwells in the great hall. One who can wander in darkness shines with the same light as the sun and moon. The formless is born from the formed. Thus, the true person entrusts their destiny to the numinous terrace and returns to dwell in the origin of things. They see in darkness and hear in silence. Within darkness, they alone are enlightened; within stillness, they alone are illuminated. Their use is non-use; only through non-use can they be used.\n\nThe knowing of it is unknowing; only through unknowing can one know. The Dao is that by which things are guided; virtue is that by which life is supported. Benevolence is the proof of accumulated kindness; righteousness is the alignment of the heart with the harmony of the multitude. When the Dao declines, virtue arises; when virtue wanes, benevolence and righteousness emerge. Thus, in the highest age, one follows the Dao and does not rely on virtue; in the middle age, one upholds virtue and does not cling to it; in the lowest age, one anxiously clings to benevolence and righteousness, fearing their loss.\n\nTherefore, the noble person cannot live without righteousness; losing righteousness, they lose that by which they live. The petty person cannot survive without profit; losing profit, they lose that by which they survive. Thus, the noble person fears the loss of righteousness, while the petty person fears the loss of profit. Observe what they fear, and their fortunes and misfortunes diverge.\n\nLaozi said: Some matters, when one seeks to benefit them, only bring harm; when one seeks to harm them, they instead bring benefit. To feed one suffering from dampness, to drink when parched with heat, to clothe one in cold—these are what the multitude nurtures, yet what the good physician treats as illness. What pleases the eye and delights the heart is what the foolish pursue, but what the person of the Dao avoids. The sage first resists and later aligns; the multitude first aligns and later resists. Thus, the gate of fortune and misfortune, the reversal of benefit and harm, cannot but be examined.\n\nLaozi said: Those who achieve merit while departing from benevolence and righteousness are met with suspicion; those who commit faults yet possess benevolence and righteousness are surely trusted. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the constant compliance of affairs, the highest honor under heaven. Even if one’s plans are shrewd and calculations sound, one must consider calamities and resolve difficulties. If in preserving the state one departs from benevolence and righteousness, their merit will surely not be accomplished. Though one’s words may not hit the mark in defense, though one’s plans bring no benefit to the state, if one’s heart is devoted to the ruler and aligned with benevolence and righteousness, their person will surely be preserved. Thus, a hundred words and a hundred plans that are never fitting are not as good as abandoning haste and carefully examining benevolence and righteousness.\n\nLaozi said: Teaching originates with the noble person, yet both noble and petty receive its blessings; profit originates with the petty person, yet both petty and noble enjoy its fruits. If noble and petty each attain their proper place, then labor is exchanged for sustenance, and the Dao flows freely. When people have many desires, righteousness is harmed; when they have many worries, wisdom is impaired. Thus, a well-governed state delights in what preserves it, while a tyrannical state delights in what destroys it. Water flows downward and becomes vast; the ruler lowers himself before his ministers and becomes enlightened. The ruler does not contend with his ministers, and the Dao of governance flows freely. Thus, the ruler is the root, the ministers the branches. There has never been a case where the root is not flourishing yet the branches are lush.\n\nLaozi said: The love of a compassionate father for his child is not for the sake of reward; it cannot be dissolved within the heart. The sage ruler’s nurturing of the people is not for personal use; it is a nature that cannot be restrained. But if one relies on their strength, depends on their merit, and inevitably exhausts it, then kindness does not reach them. Thus, employing what the multitude loves, one gains their strength; raising what the multitude delights in, one wins their hearts. Therefore, seeing their beginning, one knows their end.\n\nLaozi said: People unite through righteousness and grow strong through fellowship. Thus, where virtue is broadly applied, its authority extends far; where righteousness is thinly spread, military control is limited. Laozi said: To gain through unrighteousness and not distribute it brings calamity upon oneself. Unable to benefit others, and with nothing for oneself, one is no different from a fool who loves their child. Thus, to hold and fill it is not as good as stopping; to measure and sharpen it is not long preserved. Within virtue lies the Dao; within the Dao lies virtue. Their transformation is boundless. Within yang lies yin; within yin lies yang. All things are thus, beyond full illumination. When fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear; when misfortune comes, auspicious signs precede it. Seeing auspicious signs yet not doing good, fortune does not come; seeing inauspicious signs yet doing good, misfortune does not arrive. Benefit and harm share a gate; misfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors. None but the divine and sagely can distinguish them. Thus it is said: Misfortune leans upon fortune; fortune hides within misfortune. Who knows their limit?\n\nWhen a person is about to fall ill, they first crave rich and fatty flavors; when a state is about to perish, it first detests the words of loyal ministers. Thus, one on the verge of death cannot be saved by a good physician; a state on the verge of collapse cannot be rescued by loyal counsel. Cultivate the self, then one can govern the people; order the household, then one can be transferred to office. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true; cultivate the household, and one’s virtue overflows; cultivate the state, and one’s virtue abounds.\n\nThe people’s means of living are clothing and food. When affairs are sufficient for clothing and food, there is merit; when insufficient, there is no merit. Affairs without merit do not long endure in virtue. Thus, following the times without success requires no change in punishment; aligning with the times without success requires no change in governance. The times will return and rise—this is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe emperor and king enrich their people; the hegemon enriches their land; the endangered state enriches its officials. A well-governed state seems insufficient; a doomed state has empty granaries. Thus it is said: When the ruler does nothing, the people enrich themselves; when the ruler does not act, the people transform themselves.\n\nTo raise an army of a hundred thousand costs a thousand gold per day. After military campaigns, there must be lean years. Thus, weapons are inauspicious tools, not the treasures of the noble person. Reconciling great resentment inevitably leaves residual resentment. How could this be anything but unvirtuous?\n\nIn ancient times, those near were not drawn close by words, nor were those far dispatched by words. When the near are pleased, the far come of their own accord. Align desires with the people, and harmony arises; share their defenses, and stability is secured. Share their thoughts, and wisdom is gained; gain their strength, and wealth is acquired; gain their praise, and renown is achieved. Actions invite bandits; words bring disaster. He who speaks first finds others already whispering behind his back—such words spread a thousand *li*. Words are disaster; the tongue is a mechanism. Once spoken, even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.\n\nFormerly, Master Zhonghuang said: Heaven has five directions, earth has five phases, sound has five notes, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and humans have five ranks. Thus, between heaven and earth, there are twenty-five types of people. The highest five are the divine person, the perfected person, the Dao person, the realized person, and the sage. The next five are the virtuous person, the worthy person, the wise person, the good person, and the eloquent person. The middle five are the public-spirited person, the loyal person, the trustworthy person, the righteous person, and the ritual person. The next five are the scholar, the artisan, the forester, the farmer, and the merchant. The lowest five are the commoner, the servant, the foolish person, the base person, and the petty person. The highest five compared to the lowest five are as humans to oxen and horses.\n\nThe sage sees with the eyes, hears with the ears, speaks with the mouth, and walks with the feet. The perfected person sees without looking, hears without listening, follows without walking, and is impartial without speaking. Thus, what the sage uses to move the world, the perfected person has never transgressed. What the worthy person uses to correct世俗, the sage has never observed.\n\nThe so-called Dao has no front or back, no left or right. The myriad things are profoundly united, without \"is\" or \"is not,\" naturally so.\n\nLaozi said: Clarity and emptiness are heaven’s brightness; non-action is governance’s constancy. Abandon kindness and benevolence, set aside sagacity and wisdom, exclude worthiness and ability, discard benevolence and righteousness, eliminate affairs and artifices, cast away flattery and deceit, and prohibit treachery and falsehood—then the worthy and the unworthy are equalized in the Dao.\n\nStillness aligns with emptiness, and emptiness enables communication. Supreme virtue is non-action, and the myriad things are all contained. The Dao of emptiness and stillness endures as long as heaven and earth, its spirit subtle, pervading all things without dominion. The twelve months revolve in cycles, returning to their beginning. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—though their natures conflict, their ways are interdependent. Thus, extreme cold harms things, yet without cold, it cannot be; extreme heat harms things, yet without heat, it cannot be. Therefore, what is permissible and what is not are both permissible—permissibility lies in principle. Seeing what is permissible, do not rush; seeing what is impermissible, do not cling. Permissible and impermissible alternate as left and right, as inner and outer. The essentials of all affairs must begin with unity, with timing as their guiding thread. From antiquity to the present, this has never changed—it is called the principle of heaven.\n\nAbove, grasp great clarity; below, employ its light. The Dao gives birth to the myriad things, ordering them through yin and yang, transforming them into the four seasons, dividing them into the five phases, each attaining its place and moving with the times. Standards and measures are constant. Extending downward to the incapable, ascending to the Dao without deviation, all ministers act with one mind. The Dao of heaven and earth is complete without striving, attains without seeking. Thus, we know that non-action is beneficial.\n\nLaozi said: The greatest simplicity has no form; the greatest Dao has no measure. Thus, heaven is round but does not conform to the compass, earth is square but does not conform to the carpenter’s square. From past to present is called *zhou*; the four directions and above and below are called *yu*. The Dao is within them, yet none know its place. Therefore, those whose vision is not far-reaching cannot discuss the great; those whose knowledge is not broad cannot discourse on the ultimate. Those who receive the Dao and communicate with things have no grounds for mutual reproach. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors used different methods and texts, yet their attainment of the people’s hearts was the same.\n\nAs for compasses, squares, hooks, and marking lines—these are tools of craft, not the means by which craft is achieved.\n\nThus, without the zither, even a master like Shi Wen could not perfect a melody; with only the zither, one cannot evoke sorrow alone. The zither is but the instrument of sorrow, not the means by which sorrow is achieved.\n\nAs for divine harmony flowing between heart and hand, where the intent roams freely to capture the spirit, adapting to changes and manifesting through the zither—even a father cannot teach this to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the untransmitted Dao.\n\nTherefore, solemnity is the ruler of form, and stillness is the master of sound. Laozi said: The Dao of heaven and earth takes virtue as its master and the Dao as its mandate. Things rectify themselves. Subtle and deeply internal, it does not value affairs; thus, it stands without awaiting achievement, is not exalted by position, does not rely on fame to be manifest, requires no ritual to be dignified, and needs no force to be strong. Thus, when the Dao is established, there is no teaching; when illumination shines, there is no scrutiny. The Dao is established without teaching because it does not usurp others’ abilities; illumination shines without scrutiny because it does not harm their affairs.\n\nThose who teach the Dao act contrary to virtue and harm things. Thus, yin and yang, the four seasons, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth share the same Dao but differ in principle; the myriad things share the same nature but differ in form. The wise do not teach one another, and the skilled do not transmit to one another. Therefore, the sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts, allowing each to follow their nature. Thus, the living bear no gratitude, the dead hold no resentment. Heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent, treating the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nCompassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness are the Dao of the narrow and near. The narrow, when entering the great, becomes lost; the near, when journeying far, becomes confused. The sage’s Dao enters the great without confusion, journeys far without bewilderment, ever empty and self-guarding—this is called the ultimate Heavenly virtue.\n\nLaozi said: The sage covers like heaven, bears like earth, illuminates like the sun and moon, harmonizes like yin and yang, transforms like the four seasons, embraces the myriad things without sameness. Without old or new, without estrangement or intimacy, thus one who models heaven—heaven does not have a single season; earth does not have a single material; people do not have a single affair. Affairs and undertakings are manifold, paths and actions are diverse.\n\nThus, in warfare, some are light, some heavy, some greedy, some incorruptible—these four are opposite and cannot be unified. The light wish to advance, the heavy wish to halt; the greedy wish to seize, the incorruptible do not covet what is not theirs. Therefore, the brave may be ordered to charge but not to hold firm; the heavy may be ordered to defend but not to assault the enemy; the greedy may be ordered to attack and seize but not to distribute wealth; the incorruptible may be ordered to uphold their duty but not to advance and seize; the trustworthy may be ordered to uphold agreements but not to respond to change. These five the sage employs together, assigning tasks according to their abilities.\n\nHeaven and earth embrace no single thing; yin and yang produce no single qi; rivers and seas do not refuse the waters of streams to become great; mountains and forests do not reject crooked branches to become lofty. The sage does not reject the words of a firewood bearer to broaden his reputation. To cling to one corner and neglect the ten thousand directions, to take one thing and discard the rest—what is gained is little, and what is governed is shallow.\n\nLaozi said: What heaven covers, earth bears, the sun and moon illuminate—forms differ, natures vary, each has what brings it peace and joy. Yet what brings joy is also what brings sorrow; what brings peace is also what brings danger.\n\nThus, the sage’s governance of the people allows each to suit their nature, to dwell where they are at ease, to do what they are capable of, to fulfill their needs, and to apply what is fitting. In this way, the myriad things are equal, none surpassing another. Among the things of the world, there is no inherent nobility or baseness. What is valued is valued according to its worth, and all things are noble; what is deemed base is base according to its nature, and all things are base. Thus, not exalting the worthy means not casting fish into trees or sinking birds into the abyss.\n\nIn the past, when Yao governed the world, Shun was Minister of Instruction, Xie was Minister of War, Yu was Minister of Works, Hou Ji was Minister of Agriculture, and Xi Zhong was Master of Craftsmen. In guiding the people, those by the water fished, those in the forests gathered, those in the valleys herded, those on the hills farmed, and those in the lowlands wove nets. On the slopes, they tilled the fields. Thus, the people used what they had to exchange for what they lacked, used their skills to exchange for what they were unskilled in. Therefore, those who rebelled were few, and those who obeyed were many. Like the wind passing through the reeds, they responded instantly, each according to its pitch, all seeking what benefited them and avoiding what harmed them.\n\nThus, neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard across borders, yet footprints did not reach the lands of other lords, and cart tracks did not extend a thousand *li* beyond. All were content in their dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a disordered state appears full, a well-governed state appears empty; a ruined state appears insufficient, a preserved state appears abundant. The empty is not without people—each guards their duty. The full is not overpopulated—all are entangled in trivialities. The abundant is not rich in wealth—desires are restrained and affairs are few. The insufficient is not without goods—people are few and expenditures are many.\n\nThus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but what they followed. Their prohibitions and punishments were not of their own doing but what they upheld. This is the Dao of supreme virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world with the Dao is not to alter human nature but to follow what is already there and guide it to flourish. Thus, following brings greatness, while acting brings smallness. The ancients who dredged waterways followed the flow of water; those who cultivated crops followed the suitability of the land; those who waged war followed the people’s desires. To be able to follow is to be invincible under heaven.\n\nThings must have their natural course before human affairs can be well-ordered.\n\nThus, the laws established by the former kings were framed in accordance with the people’s nature, setting limits and patterns for them. Without their inherent nature, they could not be made to follow teachings; with their nature but without its resources, they could not be made to adhere to the Way. Human nature possesses the resources of benevolence and righteousness, yet without the laws and institutions crafted by the sage, they cannot be guided toward proper conduct. By leveraging what they detest to prohibit villainy, punishments become unnecessary, and authority operates as if by divine power. By aligning with their nature, the world submits; by opposing their nature, laws and institutions are enacted yet remain unused. Thus, the Dao is the foundation of merit and fame, and what the people cherish. When the people cherish it, merit and fame are established.\n\nThe ancients who excelled as rulers modeled themselves after rivers and seas. Rivers and seas achieve their greatness through non-action, their vastness through humility. Thus, they endure long as the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they gather all streams; through non-seeking, they attain; through non-movement, they reach. Therefore, they govern the world without strife. By not exalting themselves, they become rich; by not displaying themselves, they become illustrious; by not boasting, they become leaders; by not possessing, they become kings of the world. By not contending, none can contend with them. By never considering themselves great, they achieve greatness. Rivers and seas are close to the Dao, thus they endure long, preserving harmony with heaven and earth.\n\nWhen kings and lords cultivate the Dao, their achievements are accomplished without possession. Without possession, they become strong and steadfast; steadfastness without oppression is the profoundness of the human Way. Profoundness in virtue leads to profoundness in merit and fame, which is called \"profound virtue.\" It is distant, yet in its relation to things, it is contrary. The world has a beginning, yet none know its principle. Only the sage understands its workings: it is neither male nor female, neither yin nor yang; it gives birth yet does not die. Heaven and earth form it, yin and yang shape it, and the myriad things are born through it. Thus, yin and yang possess roundness and squareness, shortness and length, existence and extinction. The Dao decrees their fate. It is profound and tranquil, unburdened in the mind; subtle and fitting in the Dao. Life and death share the same principle; the transformations of the myriad things unite in the One Dao. Simplicity gives rise to life, forgetting death—wherever one goes, longevity is assured. Abandoning affairs and words, practicing caution and non-action, guarding the Dao, and being meticulous in all things—this is not to dominate. Utmost subtlety is formless, the beginning of heaven and earth, the commonality of the myriad things in the Dao, yet their forms differ. Utmost subtlety is without substance, thus it can encompass all; utmost vastness is without limit, thus it becomes the myriad things. The subtlest is without interior, thus it is the honored of the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao preserves life; virtue stabilizes form. The measure of the supreme Dao is to abandon likes and dislikes, to be without knowledge, thus making intentions harmonious and the mind at peace. Do not oppose the Dao with the mind. Heaven and earth unite as one, divide into two, and reunite. Above and below do not err. Unite as one, divide into five, and reunite—this must accord with the compass and square.\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be estranged; closest yet cannot be distant. Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Laozi said: The emperor is named, yet none know his essence; the emperor values his virtue; the king esteems righteousness; the hegemon understands principle. The sage’s Dao in relation to things is without possession. When the Dao is narrow, then wisdom is employed; when virtue is shallow, then punishments are employed; when clarity is dim, then scrutiny is employed. Employing wisdom leads to inner chaos; employing punishments leads to resentment between superiors and inferiors; employing scrutiny leads subordinates to seek goodness in serving superiors, resulting in exhaustion. Thus, the sage adapts to heaven and earth, transforming their virtue. Heaven covers and earth bears; the Dao nurtures with timeliness. When nurturing is abundant, governance is achieved. Even with divine sagacity, how can it be altered? Abandoning cunning and reducing punishments, returning to clarity and stillness—things will right themselves.\n\nThe Dao as ruler is like a corpse: solemn, profound, and silent, yet the world receives its blessings. One person is covered without excess; ten thousand are covered without constraint. Thus, heavily bestowing favors or heavily imposing violence opposes the Dao. Bestowing favors is distributing alms: rewarding without merit and ennobling without labor causes those who uphold their duties to slacken in office and idlers to hasten in advancement. Violence is wanton execution: killing the innocent and those who follow the Way results in the death penalty. Those who cultivate themselves are not encouraged toward goodness, and those who engage in villainy lightly offend their superiors. Thus, bestowing favors breeds villainy; violence breeds chaos. Villainy and chaos are the customs of a ruined state, the winds of national collapse.\n\nTherefore, when the state executes, the ruler does not anger; when the court rewards, the lord does not participate. Those executed do not resent the ruler, for their crimes are fitting; those rewarded do not feel indebted to the superior, for their achievements are deserved. The people’s punishments and rewards arise from themselves. Thus, they strive for merit and cultivate their conduct, not receiving gifts from others. Therefore, the court is pristine without traces, and the fields are opened without weeds.\n\nThus, the supreme ruler is unknown yet possesses it; the kingly Way resides in non-action, practices the teaching of non-words, remains clear and still, unmoving, steadfast without wavering. It follows and entrusts to subordinates, holds them accountable without labor, devises without miscalculations, acts without errors, speaks without embellishment, conducts without formalities. Advancing and retreating respond to the times; movement and stillness follow principle. Beauty and ugliness are not favored or detested; rewards and punishments do not bring joy or anger. Names are self-assigned; affairs proceed naturally, arising not from oneself. To grasp it is to depart from it; to adorn it is to harm it.\n\nHeaven’s qi forms the hun; earth’s qi forms the po. Reversed, the profound mystery resides in its abode—guard it and do not lose it. Above, it communicates with the Great One; the essence of the Great One unites with heaven. Heaven’s Dao is silent, without form or rule, vast beyond measure, deep beyond fathoming. Constantly transforming with people, wisdom cannot grasp it; revolving without end, its transformations are like the divine. Emptiness and non-action follow, always following without leading. In governing, it listens with an empty mind, weak will, clarity, and brightness, without obscurity. Thus, all ministers converge, advancing together. Whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, none do not exhaust their abilities. The ruler attains what controls ministers; ministers attain what serves the ruler—thus the governance of the state is illuminated.\n\nLaozi said: One who is knowledgeable yet fond of inquiry is a sage; one who is brave yet fond of inquiry prevails. Relying on the wisdom of the multitude, there is nothing one cannot undertake; employing the strength of the multitude, there is nothing one cannot overcome. Relying on the strength of the multitude, even Wu Huo is not sufficient to depend on; harnessing the power of the multitude, the world is not sufficient to employ. Without authority, one cannot create momentum; without following the principles of the Dao, even a sage cannot succeed. Thus, the sage in undertaking affairs never fails to utilize available resources. One with a single merit occupies one position; one with a single ability serves one task. Strength surpassing the task means the appointer is not burdened; ability surpassing the affair means the doer is not strained. The sage employs all, thus no person is discarded, no material is wasted.\n\nLaozi said: What is called \"non-action\" does not mean that when pulled, one does not come; when pushed, one does not leave; when pressed, one does not respond; when moved, one does not act; when rigid, one does not flow; when clenched, one does not disperse. Rather, it means that private intentions do not interfere with the public Dao, and desires do not obstruct rightful methods. One follows principle in undertaking affairs and relies on available resources to establish merit. Yielding to the natural course of things, one cannot be forced into action. When affairs are accomplished, the self does not boast; when merit is established, the name is not claimed.\n\nAs for water requiring boats, sand requiring embankments, mud requiring sledges, mountains requiring carrying frames, summer channels and winter reservoirs—forming mountains from heights and ponds from lowlands—these are not what I have done. The sage is not ashamed of a humble position or the failure of the Dao to prevail, nor does he worry about the brevity of life but rather the suffering of the people. Thus, he remains ever empty and practices non-action, embracing simplicity and preserving purity, not mingling with external things.\n\nLaozi said: The ancient establishment of emperors and kings was not to indulge their desires. The sage who ascends the throne does not seek ease and pleasure for himself. For the people of the world, the strong oppress the weak, the many bully the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, and the brave invade the timid. Moreover, they harbor deceitful wisdom without teaching one another and accumulate wealth without sharing it. Therefore, the Son of Heaven was established to unify their conduct. As one person’s wisdom cannot illuminate all under heaven, the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist him. For distant lands and foreign customs beyond the reach of grace, feudal lords were established to instruct them. Thus, heaven and earth, the four seasons—none fail to respond. No affairs are concealed in the government, and no benefits are overlooked in the state. Clothing the cold, feeding the hungry, nurturing the elderly and weak, and relieving the weary—none are neglected.\n\nShennong appeared emaciated, Yao was gaunt, Shun was swarthy, Yu had calloused hands and feet, Yi Yin carried a cauldron to seek Tang, Lü Wang butchered to enter Zhou, Baili Xi was sold as a slave, Guan Zhong was bound, Confucius had no soot on his chimney, and Mozi had no warmth on his mat. They did not covet emoluments or esteem positions but sought to initiate benefits for the world and eliminate harms for the people. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, if the body does not labor and the mind does not toil in affairs, those seeking sustenance have never been heard of.\n\nLaozi said: What is called the Son of Heaven possesses the heavenly Dao to establish the world. The Dao for establishing the world is to grasp the One as safeguard, return to the root, practice non-action, emptiness, and stillness, without presence, without bounds, without limits, without end. Gazing at it, no form is seen; listening to it, no sound is heard. This is called the warp of the Great Dao.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao embodies roundness yet models itself on squareness; it turns its back on yin yet embraces yang; it is yielding on the left yet firm on the right; it treads the obscure yet bears the bright. Its transformations are boundless, yet by attaining the origin of the One, it responds to all directions. This is called divine illumination. Heaven is round and without end, so its form cannot be observed; earth is square and without edge, so its gate cannot be glimpsed. Heaven’s transformations proceed without form; earth’s growth has no measure. Among things, there are those that prevail, but only the Dao has no rival. The reason it has no rival is that it has no constant form or power.\n\nThe wheel turns endlessly, resembling the movement of the sun and moon, like the alternation of spring and autumn, the succession of day and night—ending and beginning again, brightening and darkening. It shapes form yet has no form, thus its achievements can be accomplished. It treats things as things yet is not a thing, thus it prevails without exhaustion. Those who excel in warfare become emperors; those who excel in divine transformation become kings. Those who excel in warfare emulate the heavenly Dao; those who excel in divine transformation illuminate the four seasons. By cultivating rectitude within their borders, distant lands cherish their virtue; by securing victory before battle, the feudal lords submit as guests.\n\nThe ancients who attained the Dao were still and emulated heaven and earth; when active, they followed the sun and moon. Their joy and anger aligned with the four seasons; their commands were like thunder, their voices not discordant with the eight winds. Their bending and extending did not violate the five measures. They acted according to the people’s desires and harnessed their strength, removing cruelty and eliminating harm. Those who share benefits die for one another; those who share sentiments achieve together; those who share conduct assist one another. Moving in accord with oneself, the world becomes a battleground.\n\nThus, those who are skilled in employing troops employ them for their own purposes; those who are unskilled employ them for personal gain. Employing them for their own purposes, none under heaven cannot be employed; employing them for personal gain, not a single person can be employed.\n\nIn cultivating virtue, the highest is to nurture the spirit; next is to nurture the body. When the spirit is clear and the mind is calm, all joints are at peace—this is the foundation of nurturing life. Nourishing the flesh, filling the belly, and satisfying desires are the lesser aspects of nurturing life. In governing the state, the highest is to cultivate transformation; next is to rectify the law. When the people yield to one another in disputes, dwell in humility, contend for little, and strive for labor, they daily transform and ascend toward goodness without knowing why—this is the foundation of governance. Using rewards to encourage goodness and fear of punishment to prevent wrongdoing, with laws rectified above and the people obedient below—this is the lesser aspect of governance. The ancients nurtured the root, while later ages attended to the branches.\n\nLaozi said: Rulers capable of governance do not appear in every generation; ministers capable of assisting governance are not one in ten thousand. Seeking one in ten thousand from those who do not appear in every generation—this is why supreme governance occurs but once in a thousand years. The achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every generation. Following their good intentions and guarding against their perverse thoughts, if ruler and people share the same path, the people can be good and customs can be refined. What is valued in the sage is not his creation of punishments to follow crimes but his knowledge of where chaos arises.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edge and indulges it, letting depravity and excess run rampant and then attempting to restrain them with laws and punishments, even if the world is cruelly oppressed, their treachery cannot be suppressed.\n\nLaozi said: Though the body dwells by rivers and seas, if the heart remains in the palace halls, one values life; valuing life, one轻利. Even if one cannot overcome this, following it does no harm to the spirit. If one cannot overcome it yet forcibly resists, this is called double injury. A doubly injured person does not live long. Thus it is said: Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Increasing life is called auspicious; forcing qi is called strength. This is called using its light and returning to its clarity.\n\nLaozi said: Nothing under heaven is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. What is called doing good is stillness and non-action, suiting one’s nature, rejecting excess, and having no temptations. Following one’s nature and preserving authenticity without changing oneself—thus it is said that doing good is easy. What is called doing evil is difficult: regicide, deceit, restlessness, and excessive desires are not human nature. Thus it is said that doing evil is difficult.\n\nNow, the great affliction arises from having no constant standard and being insatiable in measurement. Therefore, the juncture of benefit and harm, fortune and misfortune, cannot but be examined. The sage has no desires and no aversions. Sometimes desiring something is just enough to lose it; sometimes avoiding something is just enough to encounter it. If the mind has desires, it forgets what it is doing. Thus, the sage examines the changes between activity and stillness and adapts to the measure of giving and receiving. Harmonizing the emotions of liking and disliking, balancing the nodes of joy and anger—when activity and stillness are proper, calamities do not invade.\n\nReceiving and giving in proper measure, transgressions do not accumulate. Regulating likes and dislikes, worries do not approach. Harmonizing joy and anger, resentments do not arise. Those who embody the Dao do not seize improper gains nor yield to misfortune; they do not discard what is not theirs nor restrain what is constantly full, yet do not overflow. Ever empty, they are easily sustained. Thus, when one measures with the Dao and its arts, food fills the void, and clothing wards off cold—enough for warmth and sustenance of this seven-foot form.\n\nWithout the measure of Dao and its arts, one who seeks honor and nobility finds even the power of ten thousand chariots insufficient for joy, and the wealth of the world insufficient for delight. Therefore, the sage’s mind is level, their will is yielding, their spirit guards within, and external things cannot delude.\n\nLaozi said: \"One who overcomes others is strong, but one who overcomes themselves is mighty. To be mighty is necessarily to employ the strength of others. To employ the strength of others is necessarily to win their hearts. To win their hearts is necessarily to have first mastered oneself. Never has one who has mastered themselves lost others; never has one who has lost themselves gained others.\"\n\nThus, the foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people. The foundation of pacifying the people lies in satisfying their needs. The foundation of satisfying their needs lies in not seizing their time. The foundation of not seizing their time lies in reducing affairs. The foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderating expenditures. The foundation of moderating expenditures lies in eliminating arrogance. The foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThose who understand the nature of life do not pursue what life inherently lacks. Those who understand the nature of fate do not worry over what fate inherently denies. Why then do the eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth crave rich flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds, and the seven apertures contend with one another, harming the singular nature? Day by day, perverse desires drain the harmony of heaven. If one cannot govern their own body, how can they govern the world?\n\nWhat is meant by \"gaining the world\" is not to tread upon power and rank, nor to claim titles of honor, but to move the hearts of the world and gain the strength of the world. To have the name of facing south (as ruler) yet lack the praise of even one person—this is to lose the world. Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings, while Tang and Wu were not mere exiles.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven attains the Dao, his guard lies in the four barbarian tribes; when he loses the Dao, his guard lies among the feudal lords. When the feudal lords attain the Dao, their guard lies within their four borders; when they lose the Dao, their guard lies among their attendants. Thus it is said: \"Do not rely on others not seizing from you; rely on what cannot be seized from you.\" To practice a way that can be seized, even without regicidal or usurping conduct, is of no benefit in preserving the world.\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who govern well do not alter the old nor change the constant. Anger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is the source of human disorder. Plotting in secret, opposing virtue, delighting in instruments of misfortune, and governing human disorder—this is the height of perversity. Without harming others, one cannot complete harm. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their light, and blend with their dust.\n\nHuman nature and emotions all wish to be wiser than others and resent falling short. Wishing to be wiser breeds contention; resenting falling short breeds grievance. Contention and grievance arise, the mind is disordered, and qi flows contrary. Thus, the sage-kings of old withdrew from contention and grievance. When contention and grievance do not arise, the mind is ordered and qi flows smoothly. Therefore, it is said: 'Do not exalt worthiness, and the people will not contend.'\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who govern things do not do so through things, but through harmony. Those who govern harmony do not do so through harmony, but through people. Those who govern people do not do so through people, but through the ruler. Those who govern the ruler do not do so through the ruler, but through desire. Those who govern desire do not do so through desire, but through nature. Those who govern nature do not do so through nature, but through virtue. Those who govern virtue do not do so through virtue, but through the Dao. The Dao is the root of human nature. Without depravity or filth, long immersed in things, one forgets their origin and merges with their inherent nature.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs are not human nature; they are received from without. Thus, human nature desires equilibrium, but cravings harm it. Only those with the Dao can forsake external things and return to themselves. With self-reflection, one does not lose the true nature of things; without it, one acts in confusion, driven by desires. Indulging desires and losing one’s nature, one’s actions are never correct. In governing life, one loses the body; in governing the state, one brings chaos to the people. Thus, those who have not heard the Dao have no way to return to their nature.\n\nThe sages of old attained it within themselves, so their commands were executed and prohibitions observed. In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit. When the spirit is clear and the mind calm, things can be properly perceived. If one is misled by false praise or the eyes seduced by dazzling colors, it is difficult to achieve correctness in affairs. Therefore, emptiness is prized.\n\nWhen water is agitated, waves arise; when qi is disordered, wisdom is clouded. Clouded wisdom cannot be correct; turbulent water cannot be level. Thus, the sage-kings held to the One to govern the nature of things. The One is most precious, without preference in the world. The sage-kings entrusted themselves to impartiality, thus issuing commands for the world.\n\nLaozi said: \"Yin and yang shape the myriad things, all riding the single qi to be born. When above and below are divided in heart, qi rises and steams upward. When ruler and minister are not in harmony, the five grains do not ripen. Spring’s severity, autumn’s glory, winter’s thunder, and summer’s frost—all arise from the harm done to qi.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, it is as one body; within the six directions, it is as one form. Thus, one who is enlightened about nature cannot be coerced by heaven and earth; one who is discerning about omens cannot be deluded by strange phenomena. The sage infers the distant from the near, taking the ten thousand li as one. Qi steams between heaven and earth. Without rites, propriety, integrity, and shame, the people would all encroach upon one another, violent and cruel, still within the state of chaotic defense.\n\nWhen integrity and shame decline, and the age decays, expenditures multiply while resources dwindle. Labor is taxed, yet sustenance is insufficient. The people grow poor and bitter, and resentful contention arises. Thus, benevolence is prized, and the base are despised. Cliques form, factions gather, each promoting their allies, harboring schemes and cunning deceit—thus, righteousness is prized. Men and women dwell in mixed groups without distinction—thus, propriety is prized. The passions of life and fate press upon one another, and when unable to do otherwise, there is no harmony—thus, music is prized.\n\nTherefore, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music are means to remedy decay, not the way of universal governance. If one can truly stabilize the spirit and clarity in the world, and return the heart to its origin, then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang encompass them. Resources are sufficient, and the people are sustained. Greed, pettiness, and resentful contention do not arise. Benevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet the Dao and virtue are established in the world, and the people are not seduced by dazzling colors.\n\nThus, when virtue declines, then benevolence and righteousness are adorned; when harmony is lost, then sounds are harmonized; when propriety is excessive, then appearances are adorned. Therefore, only by knowing the Dao and virtue can one know that benevolence and righteousness are insufficient to practice. Only by knowing benevolence and righteousness can one know that propriety and music are insufficient to cultivate.\n\nLaozi said: \"The governance of clarity and stillness is harmonious and compliant, tranquil and serene, pure and unadorned, leisurely and unhurried. Within, it accords with the Dao; without, it harmonizes with all.\"\n\nThe righteousness of their words is concise yet follows principle; their conduct is joyful yet accords with human feelings. Their hearts are harmonious and free from pretense; their affairs are plain and unadorned. They do not scheme about beginnings nor debate endings. At ease, they remain; when urged, they act. Their bodies permeate Heaven and Earth, their essence aligns with yin and yang, their harmony unites the four seasons. Bright and luminous as the sun and moon, they transform through the Dao.\n\nThose who craft deception and falsehood cannot bear the weight of their hearts. Thus, Heaven covers with virtue, Earth bears with joy; the four seasons do not lose their order, wind and rain do not turn tyrannical. The sun and moon are clear and still, their radiance undiminished; the five planets do not deviate from their courses—this is the illumination of clarity and stillness.\n\nLaozi said: The duties of governing a well-ordered world are easy to uphold; its affairs are easy to perform; its rituals are easy to practice; its obligations are easy to fulfill. Thus, people do not hold multiple offices, nor do offices entail multiple tasks. Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants each dwell in their own districts, distinct by region. Farmers speak of storage with farmers, scholars discuss conduct with scholars, artisans exchange craft with artisans, merchants calculate with merchants. Thus, scholars do not neglect their conduct, artisans do not suffer in their work, farmers do not abandon their labor, merchants do not incur losses in goods. Each rests in their nature, their forms and kinds distinct, their tasks easily managed without confusion, their callings unlost and humble, their aspirations fulfilled and noble.\n\nThose of foresight and far-reaching vision possess abundant talent, yet a well-ordered world does not demand this of its people. Those of vast learning, strong memory, eloquent speech, and quick wit overflow with knowledge, yet enlightened rulers do not seek such from below. Those who scorn the world and despise material things do not follow the common tide—such is the lofty conduct of scholars—yet a well-ordered world does not take this as a model for transforming the people. Thus, what is unattainably high is not taken as a measure for people; conduct that cannot be matched is not made the custom of the state. Therefore, talents cannot be monopolized, but measures, the Dao, and arts can be transmitted through the ages.\n\nThus, a well-governed state can be maintained even by the foolish, and military affairs can be unified through law. One need not await the heroes of antiquity, for people are self-sufficient when their existing qualities are employed together. In the laws of later ages, standards are set too high, yet punishments do not reach them; burdens are made too heavy, yet penalties cannot bear them; dangers are made too severe, yet executions dare not be carried out.\n\nThe people, oppressed by these three impositions, adorn their wisdom to deceive their superiors, commit transgressions to act perilously—even with strict laws and severe punishments, their treachery cannot be suppressed. When beasts are cornered, they gore; when birds are cornered, they peck; when people are cornered, they deceive. This is what it means.\n\nLaozi said: The sound of thunder can be imitated by bells and drums; the changes of wind and rain can be known through musical harmony. What is vast enough to be seen can be measured; what is bright enough to be visible can be obscured; sounds that can be heard can be tuned; colors that can be perceived can be distinguished. Yet the greatest cannot be contained even by Heaven and Earth, and the most subtle cannot be seen even by spirits. When laws and calendars are established, the five colors distinguished, and the pure and turbid, sweet and bitter flavors differentiated, simplicity scatters and becomes tools. When benevolence and righteousness are instituted, rites and music refined, virtue shifts and becomes artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their wisdom to startle the foolish, devise deceit to assail their superiors—though the world may have those who can grasp this, none can govern by it. For the more wisdom and ability proliferate, the more virtue declines. Thus, the perfected person preserves simplicity and does not scatter it.\n\nThe governance of the perfected person is emptiness and stillness, without visible desires. The mind abides with spirit, form harmonizes with nature, calm embodies virtue, and movement accords with principle. Following the natural Dao, acting only when unavoidable, they remain indifferent and non-active, and the world is in harmony. Without desires, the people naturally return to simplicity. Without contention, wealth suffices. The giver does not claim virtue, the receiver does not decline; virtue returns of itself, yet none regard it as a favor. The eloquence of silence, the Dao that is not spoken—it is as if it were accessible. This is called the Heavenly Treasury: one may draw from it without depletion, pour from it without exhaustion.\n\nThe inexhaustible—none know whence its bounty flows—is called *Yaoguang*. *Yaoguang* is the sustenance and provision of the myriad things.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven cherishes its essence, Earth cherishes its equilibrium, and humans cherish their emotions. Heaven’s essence is the sun, moon, stars, thunder, wind, and rain; Earth’s equilibrium is water, fire, metal, wood, and soil; human emotions are thought, reflection, hearing, clarity, joy, and anger. Thus, closing the four gates and halting the five pathways, one merges with the Dao, and spirit and luminosity conceal themselves in formlessness. Essence and qi return to truth: the eyes are bright yet do not see, the ears are keen yet do not hear, the mouth is proper yet does not speak, the mind is orderly and penetrating yet does not think. Abandoning action, knowing yet not presuming, one aligns with the true nature of life and destiny, thus remaining unharmed. When essence abides in the eyes, their vision is clear; when it abides in the ears, their hearing is sharp; when it lingers in the mouth, speech is fitting; when it gathers in the heart, thought is penetrating. Therefore, closing the four gates ensures a lifetime without affliction. The four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live—this is the *zhenren* (Perfected Person). Earth’s generation of wealth and resources stems from nothing beyond the five phases. The sage regulates the five phases and thus governs without disorder.\n\nLaozi said: The balance scale, unbiased toward left or right, can determine evenness; thus it may serve as a level. The marking line, unbiased toward inner or outer, can determine straightness; thus it may serve as a standard. The ruler, unbiased in likes or dislikes, can establish laws; thus decrees may be issued. Virtue establishes no grudges, conceals no resentments—this is following the Dao and harmonizing with the human heart. Therefore, in governance, wisdom does not interfere. Water’s turbulence capsizes boats, wood’s impact snaps axles—yet one does not resent wood or stone but blames the clumsy and inept, for wisdom does not bear the burden. Thus, the Dao, when infused with cunning, breeds chaos; virtue, when infused with intent, breeds peril; the mind, when infused with scrutiny, breeds obscurity. The balance scale, compass, and square are fixed and unchanging, constant and unerring, square in movement yet unobstructed. In a single day, their form endures for ten thousand generations, their transmission lies in non-action. The One is non-action; the hundred kings employed it, and its transmission through the ages remains unaltered.\n\nLaozi said: People say, “A state may have a ruler who perishes, but the world never lacks the Dao. A person may face ruin, but principle knows no obstruction.” Thus, non-action is the root of the Dao. One who grasps this root responds to all without limit. Therefore, one does not rely on the calculations of principle but instead on one’s own ability—such limitation is not far off. The ruler who does not step beyond his chamber yet knows the world does so by relying on things to understand things, on people to understand people. Thus, the accumulated strength of many achieves what cannot be overcome; the collective wisdom of the multitude accomplishes what cannot fail. A thousand people do not exhaust their provisions; ten thousand do not abandon their tasks. Artisans do not practice disparate skills; officials do not hold concurrent posts. Each guards their duty without interference, people find their proper place, and things attain their peace. Thus, tools and implements are not faulty, and duties are not neglected. Debts are few and easily repaid; responsibilities are few and easily upheld. Tasks are light and easily encouraged. The ruler holds to minimal constraints, and the people emulate deeds that are easily accomplished. Thus, ruler and minister endure without mutual weariness.\n\nLaozi said: The emperor embodies the Great Unity; the king models the yin and yang; the hegemon follows the four seasons; the ruler employs the six pitch-pipes. One who embodies the Great Unity understands the nature of Heaven and Earth, penetrates the principles of the Dao and virtue. Their clarity and brightness illuminate like the sun and moon; their spirit and essence communicate with the myriad things. Their movement and stillness harmonize with yin and yang; their joy and anger align with the four seasons. Their covering and dew are the Dao, impartial and all-pervading. Even the smallest flying or creeping creatures depend on virtue to live, and virtue flows beyond boundaries while their fame is transmitted to later generations.\n\nThose who model yin and yang inherit the harmony of Heaven and Earth, their virtue equaling Heaven and Earth, their brilliance paralleling the sun and moon, their spirit and essence rivaling the gods. Wearing the round and treading the square, embracing the exterior and resting by the marking line, they inwardly govern the self and outwardly win the hearts of the people. When they issue commands, the world follows like the wind. Thus, the four seasons—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—take and give in measure, proceed and withdraw in balance. Joy and anger, firmness and softness do not depart from principle: soft yet not brittle, firm yet not broken, broad yet not indulgent, solemn yet not harsh. At ease and yielding, they nurture the multitude. Their virtue embraces the foolish and accommodates the unworthy, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nThose who employ the six pitch-pipes govern life and death, reward and punishment, giving and taking.\n\nThere is no Dao apart from this. To suppress disorder and restrain violence, to promote the worthy and dismiss the unworthy, to correct the crooked and make it straight, to cast out danger and make it level—this is to be clear about the Dao of giving and withholding, opening and closing, riding the moment and following the trend to subdue and employ the hearts of the people.\n\nIf an emperor does not embody yin and yang, he encroaches upon the kings; if a king does not follow the four seasons, he is diminished; if a hegemon does not employ the six pitch-pipes, he is humiliated; if a ruler loses the marking line, he is discarded. Thus, one who acts greatly in small matters will be blocked and estranged; one who acts small in great matters will be narrow and intolerant.\n\nLaozi said: \"Though the land be vast and the people numerous, this is not true strength. Though armor be sturdy and weapons sharp, these cannot be relied upon for victory. Though walls be high and moats deep, these are not true defense. Though punishments be severe and penalties harsh, these are not true authority.\" Those who govern for survival, though small, will surely survive; those who govern for ruin, though great, will surely perish.\n\nThus, the skilled defender has none to resist him; the skilled warrior has none to fight. Riding the moment and following the people’s desires, the world submits. Therefore, the good governor accumulates virtue; the good commander stores up anger. Virtue accumulated, the people may be employed; anger stored, authority may be established. Where culture reaches deeply, the power of submission is great; where virtue is spread widely, the reach of authority is broad. Broadness makes me strong and the enemy weak. The skilled commander first weakens the enemy, then fights—thus expending half the effort for tenfold the result. A state of a thousand chariots that practices civil virtue will rule; a state of ten thousand chariots that delights in war will perish.\n\nVictorious troops first secure victory, then fight; defeated troops first fight, then seek victory—this is not understanding the Dao.\n\nIn highest benevolence, Laozi said: \"The Dao of the noble person is tranquility for self-cultivation, frugality for nurturing life. Tranquil, one does not disturb those below; undisturbed below, the people do not resent. Disturbed below, governance is chaotic; the people resentful, virtue is thin. With chaotic governance, the worthy do not offer counsel; with thin virtue, the brave do not fight.\"\n\nThe disordered ruler is not thus. In a single day, he possesses the wealth of the world and the power of the throne, exhausting the people’s strength to serve his sensory desires. His will is fixed on palaces and terraces, moats and ponds, parks and gardens, fierce beasts and rare treasures. The poor starve while tigers and wolves feast on fodder; the people freeze while the palace is clad in brocade. Thus, the ruler accumulates these useless things, and the world cannot secure its own lives.\n\nLaozi said: \"Without simplicity, virtue cannot be made clear; without tranquility, the distant cannot be reached; without breadth, all cannot be covered; without uprightness and balance, decisions cannot be made.\" With the eyes of the world, one sees; with the ears of the world, one hears; with the heart of the world, one deliberates; with the strength of the world, one contends. Thus, commands penetrate below, and the sentiments of ministers rise above. All officials are well-ordered, all ministers converge like spokes to a hub. Joy is not expressed through rewards, anger not through punishment. Laws are clear but not harsh; ears and eyes are sharp but not dim. The sentiments of good and bad are daily presented before one without obstruction. Thus, the worthy exhaust their wisdom, the unworthy exert their strength; those near are at ease in their nature, those far cherish their virtue. This is the Dao of employing people.\n\nOne who rides a carriage or horse does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*; one who rides a boat and oars does not guard yet crosses rivers and seas. If words are right, though they come from a woodcutter or herdsman, they cannot be discarded; if words are wrong, though they come from a lord or minister, they cannot be used. Right and wrong cannot be judged by nobility or baseness, honor or lowliness. If a plan is useful, one need not be ashamed of its source; if words can be put into action, one need not value their eloquence.\n\nThe benighted ruler is not thus. Among his ministers, those who offer utmost sincerity and loyalty are rare; he does not employ their persons but instead befriends the crooked. The worthy cannot be seen; the distant and lowly who exhaust their strength in loyalty cannot be heard. Those who speak are confounded with words; those who remonstrate are punished with crimes. Wishing thus to pacify the world and preserve the myriad regions, he distances himself from clarity and wisdom.\n\nLaozi said: \"One who values life, though rich and noble, does not harm the body with excess; though poor and lowly, does not burden the form with profit.\" Now, inheriting the hereditary rank of one’s ancestors, one must value not losing it—life’s origin is long indeed. To lightly lose it, is this not delusion? He who values his person in governing the world can be entrusted with the world; he who cherishes his person in governing the world can be relied upon with the world.\n\nWenzi asked about the foundation of governing a state. Laozi said: \"The foundation lies in governing the self. I have never heard of one whose self is well-governed yet whose state is in chaos. Nor have I heard of one whose self is in chaos yet whose state is well-governed.\" Thus it is said: \"Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.\" The subtlety of the Dao is such that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Thus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"What conduct makes the people cherish their superiors?\" Laozi said: \"Employ them in due season and treat them with reverence, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good are my charges; the not-good are my enemies.\" In ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang turned against their enemies Jie and Zhou to serve Tang and Wu; the people of Susha attacked their own lord and submitted to Shennong. Thus it is said: \"What people fear, one cannot but fear.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"In governing the great, the Dao cannot be small; in vast lands, control cannot be narrow; in high positions, affairs cannot be burdensome; among many people, teachings cannot be harsh. Affairs burdensome are hard to govern; laws harsh are hard to enforce. Seeking much is hard to sustain. Measuring by inches to reach a *zhang* will surely err; weighing by *zhu* to reach a *dan* will surely exceed. The *dan* scale and *zhang* measure are direct and seldom err. Broad outlines are easy to grasp; intricate distinctions are hard to fathom. Thus, what harms governance and benefits disorder, the sage does not do; what harms utility and benefits waste, the wise do not practice.\n\nTherefore, in achievement, do not weary of simplicity; in affairs, do not weary of frugality; in seeking, do not weary of fewness. Simple achievements are easy to complete; frugal affairs are easy to govern; few seekings are easy to sustain. Entrusting to the multitude is easy. Thus, petty eloquence harms righteousness; petty righteousness breaks the Dao. A narrow Dao will not reach far; what reaches far must be simple. Rivers are winding yet can go far; mountains are sloping yet can be high; the Dao is leisurely yet can transform. One skilled in a single craft, versed in a single matter, or precise in a single ability can expound in detail but cannot respond broadly.\n\nIn tuning strings, small ones are tense and large ones relaxed. In establishing affairs, the lowly labor while the noble rest.\" The words of the Dao say: \"Vast and obscure, following heaven’s majesty, sharing its *qi*.\" Those who share *qi* are emperors; those who share righteousness are kings; those who share achievements are hegemons. Those who lack even one of these...\"\n\nThose who perish through these are thus: they do not speak yet are trusted, do not act yet are benevolent, do not rage yet are awe-inspiring—such is the movement of transformation by the heart of heaven. Those who act with benevolence, speak with trustworthiness, and rage with awe do so through the power of utmost sincerity. Those who act without benevolence, speak without trustworthiness, and rage without awe do so through mere outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the Dao, even few laws suffice for order; without the Dao, even many laws suffice for chaos. Laozi said: \"When the great fish loses water, it is controlled by ants; when the ruler abandons his proper role and contends with ministers over affairs, he is controlled by his officials.\" To hold position and guard duty through non-action is to govern by listening and compliance, allowing ministers to conceal their wisdom without employing it, only to monopolize affairs and dominate their sovereign.\n\nWhen the ruler does not appoint the capable but delights in acting himself, his wisdom becomes daily obstructed, and he bears responsibility alone. When his strategies are exhausted below, he cannot extend governance; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control. If his wisdom is insufficient for governance and his awe insufficient for punishment, he has nothing with which to engage the world.\n\nWhen joy and anger shape the heart and desires manifest outwardly, those who guard duty depart from rectitude to flatter superiors, and officials bend the law to follow the wind. When rewards do not match merit and punishments do not fit crimes, superiors and subordinates grow estranged, ruler and ministers resentful, the hundred offices disordered, and wisdom cannot resolve it. When praise and blame arise yet clarity cannot illuminate, the ruler, rather than acknowledging his own faults, instead blames himself—thus the sovereign grows ever more labored while ministers grow ever more idle. This is to take the place of the master carpenter in hewing wood; few who do so avoid injuring their hands.\n\nTo race a horse on foot, sinews will snap before catching up. But mounting the chariot, grasping the reins, the horse submits to the crossbar—Bo Le examines it, Wang Liang drives it, and the enlightened ruler rides it, reaching a thousand *li* without the toil of driving or examining. This is the excellence of relying on others’ resources.\n\nThe ruler’s Dao is non-action that achieves, presence without preference.\n\nWhen action arises, debate follows; when preferences emerge, defenses are raised. Debate can be seized, defenses can be lured. He who establishes yet is controlled by others cannot hold the state. Thus, the skilled establisher cannot be uprooted—this speaks of establishing the formless.\n\nOnly the spiritually transformative cannot be overcome by things. When inner desires do not leak outward, it is called \"bolted\"; when external perversions do not enter, it is called \"shut.\" With inner bolted and outer shut, what affair is not moderated? With outer shut and inner bolted, what affair is not accomplished? Thus, non-use is not inaction, and non-doing is not idleness. Words are not boasted, affairs are not seized. Follow names to demand reality, let each office attend to its own duties. Take ignorance as the Dao, restraint as the master. In this way, the affairs of the hundred offices each have their measure.\n\nLaozi said: \"Food is the people’s root; the people are the state’s foundation.\" Thus, the ruler follows heaven’s seasons above, exhausts earth’s principles below, and employs human effort in between. Thereby, all living things grow, the myriad creatures flourish. In spring, withered branches are pruned; in summer, fruits are harvested; in autumn, vegetables are stored; in winter, firewood is gathered. This ensures the people’s livelihood is never wanting, the dead are never left unburied.\n\nThe laws of the former kings did not seize all game in the hunt nor drain marshes to fish. They did not burn forests to hunt. Before the jackals’ sacrifice, snares were not set in the wild; before the otters’ sacrifice, nets were not cast in the waters. Before hawks and falcons struck, nets were not spread on the marshes. Before grasses and trees shed their leaves, axes were not taken into the mountains and forests. Before insects hibernated, fire was not used in the fields. Pregnant creatures were not killed, fledglings were not taken from nests, fish shorter than a foot were not caught, dogs and pigs under a year old were not eaten.\n\nThus, the arising of the myriad things was like steam rising from qi. This was how the former kings responded to the seasons, prepared accordingly, enriched the state, and benefited the people—yet not by seeing with their eyes or walking with their feet. To desire the people’s benefit is not to forget this.\n\nThe heart thus readies the people of its own accord. Laozi said: In ancient times, enlightened rulers took from the people with restraint and maintained their own sustenance with measure. They necessarily calculated the year’s harvest and gauged the people’s stores, knowing the surplus and deficiency. Only then did they take their due. Thus, they received what was bestowed by Heaven and Earth, avoiding the calamity of hunger and cold. Their compassion for the people was such that if the state suffered famine, they did not indulge in rich flavors; if the people endured cold, they did not don fur in winter. Sharing in the people’s joys and sorrows, the realm knew no grieving subjects nor benighted rulers.\n\nOtherwise, they took from the people without sparing their strength, demanded without reckoning their stores. Men and women could not tend to their plows and looms, yet still supplied the demands above. Their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted, they had mornings but no evenings. Ruler and minister grew estranged.\n\nFor a person to live: one man plows with his foot, yet does not exceed ten *mu*. The yield of middling fields does not surpass four *shi*. Wife and children, the old and weak, depend on this for food. Should disaster strike, there would be nothing to meet the demands above—thus the lord would pity them.\n\nGreedy lords and violent rulers drain their people to satisfy boundless desires, and the hundred clans do not receive Heaven’s harmony nor tread Earth’s virtue.\n\nLaozi said: Of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, none is greater than harmony. Harmony is the balance of yin and yang, the division of day and night. Thus, all things are born at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Birth and maturation must attain the essence of harmony. Therefore, accumulated yin does not generate, accumulated yang does not transform. Only when yin and yang unite can harmony be achieved.\n\nThus, the sage’s Way is lenient yet firm, stern yet warm, yielding yet upright, fierce yet benevolent. Too rigid, it snaps; too pliant, it bends. The Way lies precisely between rigidity and pliability. The carpenter’s line may be coiled and stored, drawn out and extended—straight yet not rigid, long yet not overreaching, short yet not lacking. Thus, the sage embodies this.\n\nIf kindness is overemphasized, one becomes weak; weakness loses authority. If severity is overemphasized, one becomes harsh; harshness loses harmony. If love is overemphasized, one becomes indulgent; indulgence loses command. If punishment is overemphasized, one invites calamity; calamity loses kinship. Thus, harmony is prized.\n\nLaozi said: A state endures because it attains the Way; it perishes because its principles are obstructed. Therefore, the sage observes transformations to discern omens. Virtue waxes and wanes, and the wind foretells its sprouts. Those who grasp the Way of life, though small, must grow great. Those with signs of ruin, though established, must fail.\n\nA state’s demise does not lie in its size, nor does the Way’s flourishing depend on smallness. Thus, a disordered state’s ruler pursues vast lands but not benevolence and righteousness, seeks high position but not virtue and the Way—abandoning what sustains existence to create what brings ruin.\n\nIf above, the Three Luminaries’ brightness is disordered, and below, the myriad people’s hearts are lost, who can bear it? Thus, those who examine themselves need not prepare against others.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers who practiced deeply called it virtue and the Way; those who practiced shallowly called it benevolence and righteousness; those who practiced thinly called it ritual and wisdom. These six are the state’s guiding principles. Deep practice brings profound blessings; shallow practice brings meager blessings. Practicing all, the world submits.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating virtue and the Way rectified the world; cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a state; cultivating ritual and wisdom rectified a village. Profound virtue is great; shallow virtue is small. Thus, position is not established by might, nor victory by unyielding strength, nor attainment by greed and contention. To stand in the world, extend the self; to conquer the world, submit the self; to gain the world, yield to it—not by seizing for oneself. Thus, the female and the yielding prevail. With benevolence and righteousness, one attains; without contention, none can contend.\n\nThe Way’s presence in the world is like the rivers and seas. The Way of Heaven: those who act spoil it; those who grasp lose it. Those who seek great renown and contend for it, I see them failing to attain it. Even if they grasp and obtain it, it does not endure.\n\nRenown cannot be sought and gained. In the world, yield to it, and the world will return to you. What the world returns to is virtue. Thus, the highest virtue, the world returns to; the highest benevolence, the realm returns to; the highest righteousness, the state returns to; the highest ritual, the village returns to. Without these four, the people do not return. Without return, using force is perilous.\n\nThus, the military is an inauspicious instrument, used only when unavoidable. Though victorious, do not praise it. Thus, it is called the realm of death, where thorns grow. Mourn it with sorrow, dwell in it with funeral rites. Therefore, the noble person pursues virtue and the Way, not prizing warfare.\n\nWenzi asked: Why are benevolence, righteousness, and ritual considered inferior to virtue and the Way?\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy; those who practice righteousness must clarify by taking and giving. Within the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal; the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice the myriad people. Thus, it is better to cultivate the Way and practice virtue, following Heaven and Earth’s nature. All things rectify themselves, and the world is provided for. Benevolence and righteousness are but adjuncts.\n\nThus, the great man dwells in profundity, not shallowness. Ritual is the ornament of substance; benevolence is the effect of kindness. Thus, ritual is based on human sentiment and does not exceed its substance. Benevolence does not overflow kindness. Grief embraces emotion; sending off the dead accords with benevolence. Nurturing life does not force what people cannot reach; it does not sever what they cannot abandon. Measuring oneself does not lose its balance. Without praise or blame, no cause arises.\n\nThus, music is made sufficient to unite joy, not exceeding harmony. It clarifies the distinction between life and death, comprehends the balance of extravagance and frugality.\n\nIn later ages, words contradict actions, emotions oppose appearances. Ritual becomes ornate and burdensome; music stirs licentious winds. Customs drown in worldliness; praise and blame gather in the court. Thus, the perfected person is discarded and unused.\n\nChasing a swift steed on foot, a person cannot outrun it; placing it in a chariot, the steed cannot outrun the person. Thus, those who skillfully employ the Way ride others’ resources to establish merit, entrusting what they can to what they cannot.\n\nThe ruler accords with the seasons, and the people repay with wealth. The ruler treats them with ritual, and the people repay with their lives. Thus, there are endangered states but no secure rulers; anxious lords but no joyful ministers.\n\nVirtue exceeding position brings honor; emolument exceeding virtue brings misfortune. Esteeming without virtue is usurpation; taking without righteousness is theft.\n\nThe sage is content in poverty, delights in the Way, does not harm life with desire, nor burden the self with profit. Thus, they do not violate righteousness to take recklessly.\n\nIn ancient times, none without virtue were honored, none without ability were employed, none without merit were rewarded, none without crime were punished. In advancing people...\n\nIn dismissing people, employ ritual; in advancing people in an age of petty men, employ righteousness. In advancing people, be as lofty as the heavens; in dismissing them, be as deep as the abyss. The ancients acted with urgency, while today we falter. In selecting horses, one errs by favoring the lean; in choosing scholars, one errs by favoring the poor. A pig may grow fat to fill the kitchen, but its bones, though brittle, are not fit for office. The noble person examines substance and does not trust mere words. To conceal a ruler’s faults and not admonish him is not the way of a loyal minister. To admonish and not be heeded is a sign of an unenlightened ruler. To see the people drowning in suffering and not grieve is not the way of a worthy lord.\n\nThus, to uphold integrity and die for righteousness is the duty of a minister. To clothe the cold and feed the hungry is the kindness of a compassionate father. To serve the great by means of the small is called \"transforming others\"; to offend the great by means of the small is called \"defying Heaven.\" Though one may ascend to the heavens at first, one will surely plunge into the abyss. Therefore, in villages and hamlets, elders are honored by age; in the court, ranks are distinguished by nobility. Those who are exalted are so because they draw near to the ruler; those who honor the aged do so because they draw near to their kin; those who respect their elders do so because they draw near to their elder brothers.\n\nThose born to nobility grow arrogant; those born to wealth grow extravagant. Thus, few among the rich and noble, if they do not illumine the Way and examine themselves, can avoid wrongdoing. To learn without weariness is how one cultivates the self; to teach without fatigue is how one governs the people. Few who abandon worthy teachers and good friends will not fall into wrongdoing. To recognize worthiness is called wisdom; to love worthiness is called benevolence; to honor worthiness is called righteousness; to revere worthiness is called ritual; to delight in worthiness is called music.\n\nThe ancients who were good at governing the world acted without acting, yet nothing was left undone. Thus, in governing the world, if one has capacity, one attains it; if one acts without acting, one achieves merit. Without capacity, every action invites misfortune. One who has capacity in governing the world is cautious, as if crossing a great river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing the four neighbors; solemn, as if a guest; melting, as if ice dissolving; simple, as if uncarved wood; turbid, as if muddy water; vast, as if a valley.\n\nThis is the capacity of one who governs the world: to be cautious as if crossing a great river in winter is to dare not act; to be hesitant as if fearing the four neighbors is to fear self-injury; to be solemn as if a guest is to be humble and reverent; to melt as if ice dissolving is to dare not hoard; to be simple as if uncarved wood is to dare not claim completion; to be turbid as if muddy water is to dare not seek clarity; to be vast as if a valley is to dare not seek fullness.\n\nTo dare not act in advancing is to dare not take the lead in retreating. To fear self-injury is to guard softness and weakness and dare not be proud. To be humble and reverent is to lower oneself and respect others. To dare not hoard is to diminish oneself and dare not be rigid. To dare not claim completion is to humble oneself and dare not be whole. To dare not seek clarity is to dwell in turbidity and disgrace and dare not be fresh. To dare not seek fullness is to see insufficiency and dare not consider oneself worthy.\n\nThus, the Dao retreats and so can advance; it guards softness and so can be strong; it lowers itself and so can be exalted; it diminishes itself and so can be full; it dwells in disgrace and so can be renewed; it sees insufficiency and so can be worthy. The Dao acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone.\n\n**On Righteousness**\nLaozi said: In all learning, one who can clarify the distinction between Heaven and humanity, comprehend the root of order and chaos, purify the mind and clarify the intent to preserve it, perceive its beginning and end, and return to emptiness and nothingness may be called enlightened.\n\nThe root of governance is benevolence and righteousness; its branches are laws and regulations. What gives rise to humanity is the root; what does not give rise to it is the branch. Root and branch are one, yet their natures differ in what they cherish. To put the root first and the branch second is the way of the noble person; to put the branch first and the root second is the way of the petty man.\n\nLaws arise to assist righteousness. To value laws and abandon righteousness is like prizing one’s hat and shoes while forgetting one’s head and feet. Benevolence and righteousness are vast and lofty. To diminish their depth while expanding their breadth is to invite ruin. To not broaden the foundation while increasing the height is to invite collapse. Thus, without a great ridgepole, one cannot bear heavy burdens. Nothing bears the weight of the state like virtue. For a ruler to possess the people is like a city possessing its foundation or a tree possessing its roots. When roots run deep, the trunk is firm; when the foundation is thick, the heights are secure.\n\nThus, affairs not rooted in the Dao and virtue cannot serve as enduring principles. Words not aligned with the former kings cannot serve as the Way. To seize upon and adopt a single deed or merit as a technique is not the universal Way of the world.\n\nLaozi said: The way of governing people is like Zaofu driving a team of four horses—aligning them with reins and bits, regulating them with the chest and breast, inwardly attaining the center of the heart, outwardly harmonizing with the horses’ will. Thus, one can traverse the Way and reach distant places, with strength to spare, advancing and retreating, turning and curving, all as one desires. Truly, one has mastered the technique.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the ruler’s team of four horses. The body cannot depart from the comfort of the chariot; the hand cannot lose the hearts of the horses. If the team is not in harmony, even Zaofu cannot traverse the Way. If ruler and ministers are not in accord, even a sage cannot bring about good governance.\n\nGrasp the Dao to guide them, and even those of middling talent can fully understand their duties. Demonstrate the proper divisions, and treachery and deceit can be halted. Observe changes as things arise; respond to transformations as affairs come. If those near are not in chaos, those far will be governed. Without relying on arbitrary teachings, one attains the natural Dao, and in ten thousand actions, nothing is lost.\n\nLaozi said: In all matters of the Dao, block the paths of deceit and guard against what has not yet arisen. Do not value self-righteousness; value the inability to do wrong. Thus it is said: Do not allow what can be desired, lest there be daily seeking; do not allow what can be seized, lest there be daily contention. If this is so, human desires will recede, and the public Way will prevail.\n\nLet those with surplus halt at the proper measure; let those with insufficiency reach what they need. Thus, the world can be unified. If one abandons duties to heed praise and blame, discards merit to employ cliques, then rare talents will long remain in their posts without advancement, and the customs of the people will be corrupted in the state while meritorious ministers contend in the court. Thus, one who possesses the Dao can govern others; one who lacks the Dao is governed by others.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the state, there is a constant, and that is to benefit the people as the root. In administering teachings, there is a Way, and that is to ensure commands are carried out. If it benefits the people, one need not follow antiquity; if it suits the affairs at hand, one need not adhere to custom. Thus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rituals to customs. Clothing, utensils, and tools each serve their use; laws, regulations, and commands each suit their purpose. Therefore, to change antiquity is not necessarily wrong, nor is following custom necessarily praiseworthy.\n\nReciting the books of the former kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping the meaning behind them. One who grasps the meaning behind their words finds that words cannot express it. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Therefore, what the sage follows is called the Dao—like metal and stone, once tuned, it cannot be altered; like the zither and lute, once a melody ends, the tuning changes.\n\nLaws, regulations, rituals, and music are the tools of governance, not governance itself. Thus, the narrow-minded cannot be discoursed with on the ultimate Dao, for they are shackled by custom and bound by teachings.\n\nLaozi said: Does the world possess any constant laws? When one aligns with the affairs of the age, accords with human principles, harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and attends to the spirits, then one may rightly govern. In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns had no decrees, yet the people followed; the Five Emperors had decrees but no punishments. The Xia dynasty did not break its word, the Yin people swore oaths, and the Zhou people made covenants—yet in the decline of later ages, men endured disgrace and slighted shame, coveted gain and lacked modesty. Thus, laws and decrees are framed in consideration of the people’s customs and tempered to their urgency; implements are fashioned in response to the times and suited to their use. Those bound by laws cannot grasp the broader vision; those constrained by ritual cannot respond to change. Only one with unique insight and singular discernment can then master the Dao and act accordingly.\n\nThose who know the origin of laws adapt to the times; those who do not know the source of governance, though they follow precedent, will ultimately bring chaos. Today’s scholars follow the ancients, inherit their practices, cling to texts, and uphold written laws, seeking thereby to govern—yet without this, they deem governance impossible. It is like forcing a square tenon into a round mortise. To achieve fitness and suitability is thus difficult indeed.\n\nTo preserve the precarious and govern the chaotic, none but the wise are capable. To extol antiquity, even fools can do in excess. Thus, the sage does not employ unused laws; the enlightened ruler does not heed unverified words.\n\nWenzi asked: From whence do laws arise?\nLaozi replied: Laws arise from righteousness; righteousness arises from what suits the multitude. When what suits the multitude aligns with the human heart, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven, nor do they emerge from the Earth.\n\nThe Way arises from the human realm yet returns to rectify the self. When sincerity reaches its root, the branches do not disorder; when one knows the essential, doubts do not confuse. What one possesses, one does not condemn in others; what one lacks, one does not demand of them. What is established below is not abolished above; what is forbidden among the people is not practiced by oneself. Thus, when the ruler enacts laws, he first applies them to himself as a model. When prohibitions prevail over his own person, his commands are obeyed by the people.\n\nFor the law is the plumb line of the world, the ruler’s measure. To suspend the law is to render law lawless. Once the law is fixed, those who meet its line are rewarded; those who fall short are punished. Though noble and exalted, none receive light rewards; though lowly and base, none suffer heavy punishments. Those who violate the law, though worthy, are surely executed; those who meet the measure, though unworthy, incur no guilt. Thus, the public Way is followed, and private desires are blocked.\n\nThe ancients established officials to restrain the people from wantonness, and set up rulers to control the officials from acting arbitrarily. Laws, measures, the Dao, and arts exist to restrain the ruler from reckless decisions. When none can act wantonly, the Dao prevails and order is achieved.\n\nThus, returning to simplicity and practicing non-action—non-action does not mean inaction, but that all proceeds from the self.\n\nLaozi said: The skilled in reward spend little yet encourage much; the skilled in punishment use few penalties yet suppress transgressions. The skilled in bestowing employ restraint yet confer virtue; the skilled in taking receive much yet incur no resentment. Thus, the sage follows what the people favor to encourage goodness, and follows what they detest to prohibit wrongdoing. Reward one, and the world rushes to follow; punish one, and the world stands in awe. Therefore, the utmost reward costs nothing, the utmost punishment is not excessive. The sage governs broadly by holding to restraint—this is what is meant.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of the minister is to discuss rightness, determine what should be done, take the lead in tasks, uphold duties, clarify roles, and establish success. When ruler and minister follow different paths, governance is achieved; when they share the same path, chaos ensues. Each attaining their proper place, acting as they should—then above and below have means to employ one another.\n\nThus, branches must not exceed the trunk, nor the tip surpass the root. Words of weight and measure, great and small, serve to restrain one another. He who gains authority wields little yet profits greatly, holds little yet controls broadly. A tree ten spans around supports a house of a thousand jun—it attains its position of advantage. A bolt five inches long can govern opening and closing—it occupies a critical point. Commands issued below must be executed: those who comply gain benefit, those who resist meet misfortune. The world obeys none but those who follow the Way.\n\nProclamations are issued and prohibitions enforced by relying on the power of the multitude. Righteousness does not seek to benefit all the people of the world, yet benefiting one leads the world to follow. Tyranny does not seek to harm all within the seas, yet harming one causes the world to rebel. Thus, actions taken and measures set must be carefully considered.\n\nLaozi said: Yield an inch to extend a foot; bend slightly to achieve great straightness. The sage acts thus. A hundred streams flow together, yet those not pouring into the sea are not valleys. Those who pursue divergent paths yet do not return to goodness are not gentlemen. Good words are valued for their practicability; good deeds, for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe faults of a gentleman are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not harm their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act recklessly; the brave do not kill without cause. They choose what is right and act accordingly, calculate propriety and proceed—thus their affairs succeed and their achievements endure, their names are praised even after death.\n\nThough possessing wisdom and ability, they must take benevolence and righteousness as their foundation before establishing themselves. Wisdom and ability proceed together; the sage unifies them with benevolence and righteousness as the plumb line. Those who meet the line are called gentlemen; those who do not are called petty men. Though a gentleman may perish, his name is not extinguished; though a petty man may gain power, his guilt is not erased.\n\nTo grasp the map of the world in the left hand and sever one’s throat with the right—even a fool would not do this, for the body is valued above the world. To face death in defending one’s ruler or parents is to regard death as a return home, for righteousness is weightier than the self. Thus, the greatest benefit to the world is great; compared to the self, it is small. What the self holds dear, compared to benevolence and righteousness, is light. This is to take benevolence and righteousness as the plumb line.\n\nLaozi said: The completeness of virtue and the Dao is like the sun and moon. Barbarians and distant tribes cannot alter their course. Intentions and actions aligned—praise or blame lie in custom; conduct uniform—success or failure lie in timing. Adapting to the world, achievements are accomplished; aligning with the times, names are established. Thus, those who establish merit and fame simplify their dealings with the world and attend closely to the times. When the moment arrives, not even a breath can be spared.\n\nThe ancients used troops not to covet land or plunder treasures, but to preserve the perishing, pacify disorder, and relieve the people of harm.\n\nThe greedy and avaricious, those of excessive desire, ravage the world and harm its people, stirring unrest so none find peace in their possessions. The sage arises resolutely to punish the violent, pacify chaos, and rid the world of harm—turning turbidity to clarity, peril to tranquility. Thus, there is no choice but to sever the Red Emperor, for he brought the scourge of fire; thus, the Yellow Emperor captured him. Gonggong wrought the calamity of water, so Zhuanxu executed him. They instructed the people in the Dao, guided them with virtue, yet if they would not heed, they confronted them with might. If might failed to compel obedience, they subdued them with arms. To kill the innocent and sustain an unjust lord—what greater harm could there be? To amass the world’s wealth to sate one man’s desires—what deeper disaster could there be? To indulge one man’s cravings and prolong suffering across the land—this is what the bonds of heaven reject.\n\nThe purpose of establishing a ruler is to suppress violence and disorder. Now, if one rides the strength of the people only to ravage them, this is like gifting wings to a tiger—how can such a thing not be eradicated? He who rears fish must remove otters and eels; he who tends beasts must eliminate jackals and wolves—how much more so for one who shepherds the people? Thus arises the necessity of arms.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of governing a state is this—above, no oppressive decrees; among officials, no onerous governance; among scholars, no deceitful conduct; among artisans, no frivolous craft. Their affairs proceed without disturbance, their tools remain whole without adornment. In times of chaos, it is otherwise: those who act vie to outdo one another in loftiness; those who observe ritual vie in ostentation. Chariots and carriages reach extremes of carving, implements descend into intricate engraving. Those who seek goods contend over what is hard to obtain, prizing it as treasure; those who disparage refinement chase after complexity, deeming it urgent. Scholars engage in cunning debate, prolonging disputes without resolution, bringing no benefit to order but only to disorder. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete them, yet they serve no practical use.\n\nThus, the laws of Shennong state: If able-bodied men do not till the soil, the world will suffer hunger; if women in their prime do not weave, the world will endure cold. Therefore, he himself plowed the fields, his wife herself wove cloth, setting the example for all under heaven. He did not prize goods hard to obtain nor esteem things of no use. Thus, if the plowman does not exert himself, he cannot sustain life; if the weaver does not labor, she cannot clothe the body. Surplus and deficiency each return to the self. When clothing and food abound, deceit and wickedness do not arise; in peace and ease, without strife, the world attains harmony. The wise have no need to deploy their defenses, the brave no occasion to display their might.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of hegemons and kings relies on planning and foresight, on prevention and strategy. They act while grasping righteousness—not to secure their own survival, but to preserve the perishing. Thus, when they hear of a ruler in a neighboring state who tyrannizes his people, they raise arms and advance to his borders, reproaching him for his injustice and rebuking him for his transgressions. When their troops reach his outskirts, the commanders issue orders: \"Do not fell trees, do not desecrate graves, do not ruin the five grains, do not burn stored provisions, do not seize the people as captives, do not gather their livestock.\" Then they proclaim: \"The ruler of this state defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, metes out judgments unjustly, slaughters the innocent—he is one whom heaven condemns and the people revile. Our army has come to depose the unrighteous and invest the virtuous. Whoever dares oppose the Dao of heaven and disturb the people as a brigand shall perish with his clan. Those households that heed our call shall be rewarded with households; those villages that comply shall be rewarded with villages; those towns that submit shall be enfeoffed with towns; those counties that yield shall be granted as marquisates. If we conquer the state, we shall not harm its people. We shall depose its ruler, reform its governance, honor its outstanding scholars, elevate its worthy and good, succor its orphans and widows, relieve its poor and destitute, release its prisoners, and reward its meritorious. The people will open their doors to welcome us, store their provisions for us, fearing only that we will not come.\"\n\nRighteous arms, upon reaching the border, halt without battle; unrighteous arms, upon arrival, meet corpses and flowing blood in mutual slaughter. Thus, those who fight for land cannot achieve kingship; those who seek for themselves cannot establish merit. Those who act for others gain the support of the many; those who act for themselves are abandoned by the many. Where the many move, even the weak become strong; where the many depart, even the great perish.\n\nLaozi said: The highest virtue governs the state, orders the realm, practices benevolence and righteousness, spreads virtue and bestows kindness, establishes just laws, and blocks the path of evil. Ministers draw near, the people harmonize, above and below unite as one, ministers join forces, feudal lords submit to might, and the four directions cherish virtue. Rectifying the court, they repel threats a thousand *li* away; issuing commands, the world responds in unison—this is the highest achievement. When the land is vast, the people numerous, the ruler worthy, the generals capable, the state wealthy, and the army strong, with discipline firm and orders clear, two evenly matched foes may never engage in battle before the enemy flees—this is the next best. Knowing the suitability of the land, mastering the advantages of perilous terrain, discerning the shifts of harsh governance, and examining the affairs of battle formations—when blades clash and arrows fly like rain, the dead and wounded fill the land, blood flows for a thousand *li*, and bones lie exposed across the fields—this is the lowest of righteousness.\n\nThe outcome of war lies in governance. When governance prevails and the people submit to their superiors, the army is strong and the people victorious. When governance fails and the people rebel against their superiors, the army is weak. Righteousness suffices to embrace the people of the world; deeds suffice to meet the world’s crises; selection and appointment suffice to win the hearts of the worthy; planning and deliberation suffice to decide matters of weight—this is the Dao of the highest virtue.\n\nLaozi said: The reason a state becomes strong is its people’s willingness to die. The reason they are willing to die is righteousness. The reason righteousness prevails is might. Thus, govern with civility and align with martial power—this is called certain victory. Might and righteousness advance together—this is called certain strength. When blades cross and arrows fall like rain, yet soldiers vie to advance, it is because rewards are certain and punishments clear. If the ruler regards his subjects as sons, they will serve him as fathers—he will rule the four seas. If subjects serve their ruler as fathers, they will govern the world. If the ruler regards his subjects as younger brothers, they will be willing to die for him. If subjects serve their ruler as elder brothers, they will be willing to perish for him. Thus, one cannot contend with enemies bound as father and son, brothers. Therefore, a righteous ruler internally cultivates governance to accumulate virtue, externally blocks evil to clarify his power, examines the toil and ease of his people to know their hunger and satiety. When the day of battle arrives, they face death as if returning home. The grace bestowed upon them is supreme.\n\nLaozi said: In high antiquity, the True Person breathed in harmony with yin and yang, and all living things looked up to their virtue, attaining harmony and compliance. In that time, governance was subtle and hidden, naturally forming purity and simplicity. Before purity and simplicity dispersed, the myriad things flourished in abundance. As the age declined...\n\nWhen it reached the era of Fuxi, the world was dim and murky, yet all sought to cast off their childlike simplicity and awaken to the realm between Heaven and Earth. Their virtue grew tangled and inconsistent. By the time of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, they meticulously ordered the world’s principles, aligning the four seasons and harmonizing yin and yang. Thus, the myriad people stood in reverence, yearning to support and obey, listening and observing. Yet governance, though orderly, lacked harmony.\n\nDescending to the Xia and Yin dynasties, desires extended to external things, and keen perception was lured outward. Nature and destiny lost their authenticity. When it came to the Zhou, purity thinned and simplicity scattered. The Dao was abandoned in favor of artifice; frugality in virtue became a mere act. Cunning and skill sprouted, and crafty learning imitated the sages. Ornate falsehoods coerced the masses. Poetry and books were polished and adorned to trade for fame and reputation. Each sought to enact their cleverness and deception to fit into the world, losing the root of the great origin. Thus, the world suffered the loss of nature and destiny, and decline crept in over a long course.\n\nTherefore, the learning of the True Person aims to return nature to the uncarved and roam the mind in emptiness. The learning of世俗, however, plucks at virtue and seizes at nature, inwardly vexing the five viscera, recklessly acting, and surpassing wisdom to clamor for fame and reputation in the world—this is what the True Person does not do. Plucking at virtue is self-display; seizing at nature is severing life.\n\nAs for the True Person, they settle the meaning of life and death and penetrate through...\n\nThe principle of honor and disgrace is such that even if the whole world praises it, it does not increase encouragement; even if the whole world condemns it, it does not add to discouragement—this is the essence of attaining the great Dao. Laozi said: In ancient times, rulers wore their hair loose and without collars to govern the world. Their virtue gave life without killing, bestowed without seizing. The world did not share their attire but embraced their virtue. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious, and the myriad things flourished. The nests of flying birds could be reached and examined by bending down; wild beasts could be leashed and followed.\n\nWhen decline set in, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all became harms to the people. Thus, iron was cast and blades forged to defend against these calamities. When people were pressed by hardship, they sought convenience; when afflicted by disaster, they prepared defenses. Each used their wit to avoid harm and pursue benefit, always deviating from constancy and unable to follow precedent. Tools and weapons could not remain unchanged, so the laws and standards of former kings were subject to alteration. Thus it is said: \"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\n\nThe Five Emperors followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; the Three Kings pursued distinct affairs yet their names endured through later generations. They changed with the times, like the tuning of the five notes by the master musician Shi Kuang. Though the shifts rise and fall without constancy, measuring by the foot and inch, none miss the mark. Thus, one who understands the essence of music can create sound; one who has a fundamental principle within and knows the use of compass and square can govern people. Therefore, the systems of former kings should not be immediately abolished; the affairs of the latter age, if good, should be recorded. Thus, the sage who establishes rites and music does not create them for rites and music alone; the one who regulates things does not do so for things alone; the one who establishes laws does not do so for laws alone. Hence it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage kings of old took symbols from heaven above, measures from earth below, and models from humanity between. They harmonized the qi of yin and yang, balanced the seasons’ nodes, and examined the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—whether fertile or barren, high or low—to establish affairs, generate wealth, eliminate the suffering of hunger and cold, and ward off the disasters of illness and plague. They received human affairs at their center to create rites and music, practiced the Dao of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relationships, and distinguished the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish the intimacy of father and son and form the family. They listened to the clear and turbid of the five notes and the mutual generation of the six pitch-standards to establish the righteousness of ruler and minister and form the state. They observed the sequence of the four seasons—first, middle, and last—to establish the order of elder and younger and form the bureaucracy. They divided the land into provinces and governed the state through districts, establishing universities to educate. These were the guiding principles of governance.\n\nAttaining the Dao leads to flourishing; losing it leads to decline. No thing has ever been stretched without relaxation or prospered without decay. Only the sage can prosper without decay. When the sage first created music, it was to return the spirit to the altar, curb excess, and restore the heavenly heart. When it declined, it flowed without return, became licentious and enamored of beauty, disregarding proper laws, and spread to later generations until it led to the ruin of states.\n\nWhen the sage first created writing, it was to govern and order the hundred affairs. The foolish used it to avoid forgetting; the wise used it to record events. When it declined, it was employed for deceit and falsehood to absolve the guilty and kill the innocent.\n\nWhen the sage first created parks, it was to prepare offerings for ancestral temples and train soldiers to guard against unforeseen events. When it declined, they galloped and hunted, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength.\n\nWhen the sage first honored worthies, it was to level education, rectify lawsuits, place the worthy in office, and employ the capable. Grace flowed downward, and the myriad people cherished virtue. When it declined, cliques formed, each promoting their own, abandoning the public for private interests. Inside and outside, they recommended one another; the wicked held office while the worthy withdrew. The Dao of heaven and earth reaches its extreme and then returns; it gains and then loses. Thus, the sage governs corruption by reforming systems, ends one affair and begins another. Its beauty lies in harmony; its flaw lies in power.\n\nThe Dao of the sage says: Without cultivating rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame, the people cannot be governed. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot rectify. Without exalting the good and abolishing the ugly, there is no turn toward rites and righteousness. Without laws, there can be no governance. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented. Laws can kill the unfilial but cannot make people filial; they can punish thieves but cannot make people honest.\n\nWhen the sage king is above, he clarifies likes and dislikes to show the people, uses constant praise and blame to guide them, promotes the worthy and advances them, despises the unworthy and demotes them. Punishments are set aside and unused; rites and righteousness are cultivated, and the virtuous are employed. Thus, the highest in the world become the Three Dukes; the highest in a province become the Nine Ministers; the highest in a state become the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters; the highest in a village become the Eighty-One Primary Officers. Those whose wisdom surpasses ten thousand are called heroes; a thousand, called talents; a hundred, called杰; ten, called豪.\n\nOne who understands the Dao of heaven and earth, comprehends the principles of human emotions, is vast enough to embrace the multitude, benevolent enough to cherish the distant, wise enough to know power—this is a hero. One whose virtue is sufficient to teach and transform, whose conduct is sufficient to conceal righteousness, whose trustworthiness is sufficient to gain the people, whose clarity is sufficient to illuminate below—this is a talent. One whose conduct can serve as a model, whose wisdom is sufficient to resolve doubts, whose trustworthiness can keep promises, whose integrity can distribute wealth, whose actions can be emulated, whose words can be followed—this is a杰. One who guards their office without neglect, stands by righteousness without cliques, faces danger without careless escape, and sees profit without careless gain—this is a豪.\n\nHeroes, talents,杰, and豪 each occupy their positions according to the magnitude of their abilities. From root to branch, from heavy to light, the superior initiates and the inferior harmonizes. Within the four seas, all are of one heart, turning from greed and baseness toward benevolence and righteousness. Their transformation of the people is like the wind bending grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy oversee the worthy, even with severe punishments, they cannot suppress their treachery. The small cannot control the great; the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of heaven and earth. Thus, the sage promotes the worthy to establish merit. The unworthy ruler promotes those he favors. Observing whom they promote reveals the distinction between order and chaos. Examining their cliques reveals whether they are worthy or unworthy.\n\nLaozi said: Those who create rites carve and polish human nature, distorting its true feelings. Though the eyes desire, they are restrained by measure; though the heart delights, they are moderated by rites. They pace and circle, bow and humble themselves, kneel and stiffen without eating, clarify wine without drinking. Outwardly, they bind their form; inwardly, they distress their virtue, restraining the harmony of yin and yang and oppressing the true feelings of life and destiny. Thus, they spend their lives in sorrow. Why? They do not address the root of desire but prohibit what is desired; they do not trace the origin of joy but block what brings joy. This is like penning beasts without sealing the fence, restraining their wild hearts, or damming the flow of rivers with one’s hands. Thus it is said: \"Open its aperture, assist its affairs, and it will be incurable for a lifetime.\"\n\nRites suppress emotions and close off desires, using righteousness to guard the self. Though the heart is choked and the form and nature starve and thirst, they force themselves with reluctance. Thus, none can complete their natural lifespan. Rites cannot make people cease desiring.\n\nYet those who would restrain joy cannot make people cease rejoicing but only block its expression. To make the world fear punishment and refrain from theft—how is this better than eradicating the very thought of theft? Thus, one who knows there is no use for a thing, though greedy, will renounce it; one who does not know its use, though upright, cannot refuse it. The downfall of states, the death of rulers at the hands of men, the scorn of the world—were these not all born of desire? Like a fan in winter or a fur in summer, when a thing serves no purpose, the myriad things crumble to dust.\n\nThus, to ladle boiling water to halt its bubbling only makes it boil more fiercely. One who knows the root removes the fire and nothing more. Laozi said: \"To follow one’s nature in action is called the Dao; to attain one’s heavenly nature is called virtue. When nature is lost, then one values benevolence and righteousness. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. Pure simplicity scatters, and rites and music adorn. Disputes arise, and the people vie for pearls and jade.\" Rites serve to distinguish the noble from the base, righteousness to harmonize the relations of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—the boundaries of human conduct. In the degenerate age, rites become hollow courtesy, and righteousness, mere exchange; generosity secures alliances, but ministers turn against rulers, and those not of the same flesh breed resentment.\n\nThus, where water pools, creatures that devour one another arise; where earth piles, beasts that feed on their own kind emerge. Where rites and music adorn, deceit and falsehood flourish. The governance of the degenerate age does not accumulate the means of nurturing life but dilutes the world’s purity, scatters its simplicity, and confounds the people. It takes clarity for turbidity, disrupts the flight of life and destiny, and turns integrity into chaos. People lose their nature, law and righteousness oppose each other, conduct and profit run counter. The gap between rich and poor widens, and the distinction between ruler and slave becomes negligible. When there is surplus, people yield; when there is scarcity, they contend. Yielding gives rise to rites and righteousness; contention breeds violence and disorder. Thus, with many desires, affairs become unmanageable; with insatiable demands, strife never ceases.\n\nIn an orderly age, petty men uphold rectitude, and profit cannot seduce them. In a chaotic age, even gentlemen turn to treachery, and the law cannot restrain them. Laozi said: \"The rulers of a declining age bore into mountains and rocks to extract gold and jade, smelt seashells and bronze, yet the myriad things do not flourish. They rip open wombs, burn the wilds, overturn nests, and destroy eggs. The phoenix does not soar, the qilin does not roam. They build towers of timber, burn forests for the hunt, drain marshes to fish, pile earth into mounds, dig wells to drink, dredge rivers to make pools, and fortify walls for defense. They cage beasts as livestock, and thus yin and yang are thrown into chaos, the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter, hail and frost bring harm. The myriad things wither and perish in great numbers; grasses and trees wither in summer. The Three Rivers run dry, mountains and streams are divided into boundaries, populations are tallied and apportioned. They devise traps and barriers, establish ranks and colors to mark noble and base, reward the worthy and punish the unworthy. Then arms rise, and strife is born; the innocent are slaughtered, the guiltless are punished.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the world is about to lose its nature, it is as if a dark vapor has arisen. The ruler is benighted and unclear, the Dao is abandoned and not practiced, virtue perishes and is not upheld. Affairs run counter to heaven, decrees defy the four seasons. Spring and autumn contract their harmony, heaven and earth strip away their virtue. The ruler occupies his position yet finds no peace; ministers retreat and remain silent. Officials anticipate the ruler’s will and disrupt constancy, alienate kin and secure their own position. Flatterers scheme in secret, swiftly corrupting the arrogant ruler, mirroring the chaos of the people to advance their ends. Thus, ruler and minister grow estranged, kin drift apart. Fields yield no standing grain, roads know no leisurely steps. Gold piles up but loses its edge, jade is hoarded yet cracks. Tortoise shells lie hollow, milfoil stalks are stripped bare. Divination is practiced daily, yet the world remains divided. Each feudal lord enacts his own laws, customs clash, roots are uprooted, and the fundamental is discarded. The five punishments are carved into sharpness, and men contend over the tip of an awl. They slaughter the people, cutting down more than half. Armies rise to wage war, besieging cities with indiscriminate killing. They scale high walls, secure perilous passes, deploy siege engines, and array battle formations. Soldiers die on the roads, charging fierce enemies. For every hundred who go forth, one returns. Reputations are falsely aggrandized, states are annexed, lands are seized. Corpses number in the hundreds of thousands, the old and weak perish from hunger and cold—countless. From this time onward, the world never regains the peace of its nature or the joy of its customs.\n\nThen the worthy and sagely arise in great numbers, upholding the Dao and virtue, aided by benevolence and righteousness. The near are advanced by wisdom, the far are embraced by virtue. The world is united as one, and generations succeed one another. They suppress the roots of flattery, silence the arguments of sophistry, abolish harsh laws, and remove vexatious affairs. They banish the traces of slander, block the gates of faction, and dissolve cunning and ability. Following the great constancy, they cast aside the limbs, discard cleverness, and unify the barriers. The myriad things each return to their root. The sage does not create the times but seizes them when they come, never missing the mean. Thus, the Dao is not severed midway.\n\nLaozi said: \"The depth of the Feng River is ten *ren*, yet it does not receive dust or filth. Gold and stone lie within, their forms visible without—not because it is not deep and clear, but because fish, turtles, and dragons do not gather there. No five grains grow on stony ground, no elk or deer roam barren hills—there is nothing to shelter or conceal. Thus, in governance, to take severity for discernment, sharpness for clarity, harshness for loyalty, and calculation for merit—this is like stretching leather: the path to great defeat and rupture. Such governance is murky, and the people are simple; it is exacting, and the people are flawed.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with cunning. First establish an invincible defense, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack another’s chaos with one’s own disorder is like meeting fire with fire or water with water—neither can overcome the other. Thus, the extraordinary lies in difference: stillness overcomes restlessness, order overcomes chaos, satiety overcomes hunger, ease overcomes toil. The interplay of the extraordinary and the upright is like the mutual conquest of water, fire, metal, and wood—wherever it turns, it prevails. Thus, when virtue is equal, the numerous overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise overcome the foolish; when wisdom is equal, those with strategy overcome those without. This is the *Wenzi*, Scroll the Lower.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Wenzi*\n*Daoist School* – Descriptive Summary\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Wenzi* comprises twelve chapters, authored by Xin Gan of the Zhou. Xu Guang states that Wenzi’s given name was Gan; Li Xian says his surname was Xin, a man from Kuiqiu in Puxiang, styled Jiran. Fan Li studied under him. Pei Yin records that Jiran’s surname was Xin, his courtesy name Wenzi, and that he was a descendant of a prince of Jin. Meng Kang says his surname was Ji and his given name Ran, a minister of Yue. Cai Mo claims that *Jiran* was the title of a book written by Fan Li, not a person, the name meaning “that which is calculated and found correct.” Yan Shigu counters that Cai’s assertion is erroneous: the *Tables of Ancient and Modern Personages* ranks Jiran in the fourth class, listing Jiran as an alternate name for Ji Yan. The *Annals of Wu and Yue* and *Yuejue shu* both write it as Ji Ni, the characters *ni* and *yan* being close in pronunciation and thus prone to confusion.\n\nNow, according to Yu Zhongrong’s *Excerpts from Masters*, there are two Wenzi: one a descendant of the prince of Jin, whose given name is lost, who traveled south to Yue and styled himself Wenzi, also known as Jiran. Fan Li studied under him, and by heeding his counsel, Yue achieved hegemony. This account is not only found in the *Annals of Wu and Yue* but also in Liu Shao’s *Imperial Survey*. The so-called *Fanzi Jiran* consists of Fan Li’s questions and Jiran’s answers. The Wenzi who authored this book, however, must be Xin Gan. Ma Zong’s *Forest of Meanings* lists the *Fanzi Jiran* in thirteen chapters, encompassing yin-yang and calendrical calculations, distinct from this work. The claim that his surname was Xin likely perpetuates the error in the *History of the Northern Dynasties*, which conflates the arts of Tao Zhu with Xin Wen, unaware that Yu’s *Excerpts* originally distinguished two Wenzi.\n\nLiu Zongyuan, in his critique of this book, suggests it was written by a disciple of Laozi, citing passages where Wenzi engages in dialogue with King Ping. Zhou Shi’s *Brush Notes* argues that this refers to King Ping of Chu, implying Wenzi was a Zhou man rather than the Jiran of Wu and Yue—a plausible claim. While the text consistently follows Laozi’s teachings, whether Wenzi was truly Laozi’s disciple remains uncertain. Zongyuan dismisses the book as spurious, mocking its muddled and derivative nature. He notes that nearly all its content is cribbed from the Mencian school and other sources, assembled as if by a magpie. Yet its principles are profound, its prose forceful and refined—unachievable by anyone but a figure of the Zhou-Qin era, setting it apart from the forgeries of Guan Yin and Kang Cang. The *Han Catalogue* records it as nine chapters; the Northern Wei scholar Li Xian and the Tang master Xu Lingfu both annotated twelve-chapter versions. Li’s commentary is now rare, while fragments of Lingfu’s survive. This edition, printed in Wu, is unannotated and divided only into upper and lower volumes. Li Xian studied under the monk Prajñāruci; Lingfu, styled Moxi, once revered this book as the *Tongyuan Zhenjing* during the Tianbao era of Tang. Respectfully submitted in the first month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n*Chief Compilers:*\nMinister Ji Yun\nMinister Lu Xixiong\nMinister Sun Shiyi\n\n*Chief Collator:*\nMinister Lu Feichi",

Only an image—without form, profound and obscure, silent and desolate, faint and indistinct, its sound unheard. I force a name upon it and call it the *Dao*.\n\nNow, the Dao is lofty beyond reach, deep beyond fathoming. It enfolds Heaven and Earth, bestowing and receiving without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, surging yet never full. When turbid, still it slowly clears; when bestowed, it is inexhaustible. It has no fixed time, yet its manifestations never exceed a handful. Contracting, it can expand; hidden, it can illuminate; yielding, it can be firm. It contains yin and exhales yang, thereby manifesting the Three Luminaries. Mountains rise by it; abysses deepen by it. Beasts run by it; birds fly by it. Unicorns roam by it; phoenixes soar by it. Stars and planets move by it. It takes from nothingness to preserve being; from humility to attain eminence; from retreat to secure precedence.\n\nIn ancient times, the Three Sovereigns grasped the thread of the Dao and stood at the center. Spirit roamed with transformation to pacify the four quarters. Thus they could align with Heaven’s revolutions and Earth’s stability, turning without cease.

      "translated_text": "Harmony encompasses ten thousand differences yet accords with life. Harmony regulates yin and yang, moderates the four seasons, and harmonizes the five phases, moistening grasses and trees, seeping into metal and stone. Birds and beasts grow large, fur and feathers glisten; bird eggs do not spoil, beast fetuses do not miscarry. Fathers know no grief for lost children, elder brothers no sorrow for weeping younger brothers. No child is orphaned, no woman widowed. Rainbows do not appear, thieves and bandits do not roam—all this is the result of embracing virtue. The eternal Dao of Heaven gives life to things yet does not possess them, completes transformations yet does not govern. The myriad things rely on it to live, yet none know its power; rely on it to die, yet none can resent it. It hoards and accumulates without growing richer, distributes and bestows without increasing poverty.\n\nVague and indistinct, it cannot be grasped as form; indistinct and vague, its use is inexhaustible. Profound and obscure, it responds to transformations without shape. It flows unimpeded, never idle in motion, moving with hardness and softness, coiling and uncoiling with yin and yang, rising and falling. Laozi said: \"The great man is serene, without thought; tranquil, without care. He takes Heaven as his canopy, Earth as his chariot, the four seasons as his horses, yin and yang as his drivers.

      "translated_text": "Where there are no gates, taking Heaven as one’s canopy, nothing remains uncovered; taking Earth as one’s chariot, nothing remains unborne. Taking the four seasons as one’s horses, nothing remains uncommanded; taking yin and yang as one’s drivers, nothing remains unprepared. Thus, swift yet unshaken, distant yet untiring, the four limbs unmoving, perception and insight undiminished, one illuminates and perceives all under Heaven—this is grasping the essence of the Dao and beholding the boundless realm.\n\nTherefore, the affairs of all under Heaven cannot be forced; one must follow their spontaneity and extend it. The transformations of the myriad things cannot be averted; one must hold fast to their essence and return to it. Thus, the sage cultivates the root within and does not adorn the branches without, honing the spirit and laying aside knowledge and perception. Therefore, in profound nonaction, nothing is left undone; in non-governance, nothing is left ungoverned.\n\nWhat is called \"nonaction\" is not acting before things do; \"non-governance\" is not altering their spontaneity; \"nothing left ungoverned\" is following the mutual arising of things. Laozi said: \"One who grasps the Dao to govern the people responds to affairs as they arise and follows things as they move. The transformations of the myriad things all find their response; the changes of the hundred affairs all find their harmony.\"\n\nThus, the Dao is emptiness and nothingness, level and easy, pure and tranquil, soft and weak, pure and unadorned—these five are the forms and images of the Dao. Emptiness and nothingness are the abode of the Dao; levelness and ease are its plainness; purity and tranquility are its mirror; softness and weakness are its function. Reversion is the constant of the Dao; softness is the hardness of the Dao; weakness is the strength of the Dao. Purity, unadornment, and simplicity are the trunk of the Dao.\n\nEmptiness means the center bears no burden; levelness means the heart bears no encumbrance. Desire and craving unborne are the perfection of emptiness; no preferences or aversions are the perfection of levelness. Unchanging unity is the perfection of tranquility; unmixed with things is the perfection of purity. Neither sorrow nor joy is the perfection of virtue.\n\nIn the governance of the perfected person, hearing and sight are set aside, ornamentation is extinguished, the Dao is relied upon, and wisdom is abandoned. Emerging together with the people, one simplifies what is held, reduces what is sought, discards enticements and longings, removes greed and desire, and relinquishes thoughts and anxieties. Simplifying what is held brings clarity; reducing what is sought brings attainment. Thus, with the center controlling the exterior, the hundred affairs are not neglected. If the center attains it, the exterior can be shepherded; the center’s attainment is this:\n\nThe five viscera are at peace, thoughts and anxieties are level, sinews and bones are strong and sturdy, ears and eyes are keen and bright. The great Dao is smooth and broad, departing from the self yet not far. Those who seek it afar go forth only to return. Laozi said: \"The sage forgets governance of others and resides in self-cultivation; esteeming forgetfulness.\"",

      "translated_text": "The power of position lies in self-attainment; when one attains the self, the world attains me. Joy forgets it; wealth and honor lie in it. Harmonizing knowledge, one makes the self great and the world small, guarding the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: \"Utmost emptiness, profound stillness.\" The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. The Dao shapes and nurtures the myriad things, beginning and ending without form, silent and unmoving. Vast and boundless, it cannot be made external; minute and subtle, it cannot be made internal. Without walls or enclosure, it gives birth to the general names of being and non-being.\n\nThe perfected person embodies it with emptiness and non-being, levelness and ease, purity and tranquility, softness and weakness, purity and simplicity. Not mingling with things, utmost virtue is the Dao of Heaven and Earth—thus they are called perfected persons. The perfected person knows the self as great and the world as small, values governing the self and disdains governing others. Things do not disturb their harmony; desires do not confuse their essence. Their name and form vanish when the Dao is present; when the Dao is absent, they appear. In non-action, affairs are without affairs; in knowing, there is not-knowing.\n\nEmbracing the Heavenly Dao, encompassing the Heavenly mind, they exhale and inhale yin and yang, expel the old and take in the new. With yin, they close; with yang, they open. With hardness and softness, they roll and unfold. With yin and yang, they bow and rise. Their heart is one with Heaven; their body is one with the Dao. They take no joy, suffer no sorrow, feel no delight, bear no anger. The myriad things are profoundly the same—without right, without wrong.\n\nWhen form is harmed by the cruelty of cold, heat, dryness, and dampness, the form is exhausted and the spirit blocked. When the spirit is harmed by the afflictions of joy, anger, thought, and anxiety, the spirit is spent and the form remains in excess. Thus, the perfected person employs the heart to restore nature, relying on the spirit to support each other and attain beginning and end. Therefore, in sleep, they do not dream; awake, they have no worries.\n\nConfucius asked the Dao of Laozi, who said: \"Correct your form, unify your gaze, and Heavenly harmony will arrive. Gather your knowledge, rectify your measures, and the spirit will come. Abandon virtue, and it will become your countenance; the Dao will become your dwelling. Your pupils will be bright as a newborn calf, seeking nothing of the old. Your form will be like withered wood; your heart like dead ashes. Truly, their knowledge does not bend to circumstances, and they hold themselves with boundless ease. Clear and bright, reaching in all four directions—can one be without knowledge?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who attend to life respond to change and act; change arises from the times. Those who know the times follow no constant course. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name. Writing arises from words; words emerge from knowledge. The wise do not know the constant Dao. The name that can be named is not that of the one who treasures books. Much learning leads to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center. Abandon learning, and there will be no worries; discard sagacity and wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.\n\nHumans are born tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Stirred by things, they move—this is nature’s desire. Things arrive, and knowledge responds.\"",

      "translated_text": "When knowledge engages with things, likes and dislikes arise. Once likes and dislikes take form, knowledge turns outward, unable to return to the self, and Heavenly principle perishes. Thus, the sage does not exchange Heaven for man—externally transforming with things while inwardly preserving true nature. Those who penetrate the Dao return to clarity and stillness; those who exhaust themselves in things end in non-action. Cultivating knowledge with tranquility, uniting the spirit with emptiness—this is to follow the gate of non-doing and wander with the Dao. Those who follow men engage with the vulgar. Thus, the sage does not disturb Heaven with affairs, nor disorder the emotions with desires. Without scheming, things fall into place; without speaking, trust is established; without deliberation, attainment comes; without acting, completion is achieved. Therefore, though he dwells above, the people do not find him burdensome; though he stands before them, none feel harmed. The world turns to him, and the wicked fear him, for he contends with nothing. Thus, none dare contend with him.\n\nLaozi said: \"When man follows desire, he loses his nature, and his movements are never upright. In governing the state, this brings chaos; in cultivating the self, it brings decay. Those who have not heard the Dao cannot return to their nature; those who do not understand things cannot attain stillness. Human nature is originally without depravity—long immersed in things, it becomes altered and forgets its root, just as water’s nature desires clarity, but sand and stones pollute it. Human nature desires equilibrium, but desires harm it. Only the sage can forsake things and return to the self. Thus, the sage does not enslave things with knowledge nor disturb harmony with desire. In joy, he is not exultant; in sorrow, he is not distressed. Therefore, though exalted, he is not imperiled; though secure, he is not overthrown. Even the foolish recognize the value of wise words and sound plans; even the unworthy admire sagely virtue and lofty conduct. Many praise them, but few employ them; many admire them, but few practice them. The reason lies in being entangled by things and bound by custom.\"\n\nThus he said: \"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I refrain from meddling, and the people prosper of their own accord; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I am without desire, and the people become simple. Stillness is the perfection of virtue; softness and weakness are the function of the Dao. Emptiness, tranquility, and serenity are the ancestors of the ten thousand things. When these three are practiced, one merges with the formless—the formless is called the One. The One is without mind, yet harmonizes with all under Heaven. Spreading virtue without effort, using it without toil, seeing it without sight, hearing it without sound—formless, yet it gives rise to form; soundless, yet the five notes resound; tasteless, yet the five flavors take shape; colorless, yet the five hues emerge. Thus, being arises from non-being, and reality from emptiness. The number of notes does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five notes cannot be fully heard; the number of flavors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five flavors cannot be fully tasted; the number of colors does not exceed five, yet the variations of the five colors cannot be fully seen. In sound, when the gong is established, the five notes take form; in flavor, when sweetness is established, the five flavors are determined; in color, when whiteness is established, the five hues are complete. In the Dao, when the One is established, the ten thousand things are born. Thus, the principle of the One extends throughout the four seas; the blessing of the One is discerned in Heaven and Earth. In its wholeness, it is simple as uncarved wood; in its dispersion, it is turbid as muddy water—yet turbid, it slowly clears; empty, it slowly fills. Vast as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds, it seems not to exist yet exists, seems to vanish yet remains.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The sum of the ten thousand things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage establishes a single measure and follows the track, not altering the constant, not changing the norm. He takes the plumb line as his standard, the marking cord as his guide, bending with what is straight, straightening with what is constant. Joy and anger are perversions of the Dao; sorrow and grief are corruptions of virtue; likes and dislikes are excesses of the heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "Desires and cravings are the fetters of life. When one flies into a great rage, the yin is shattered; when one is overcome by great joy, the yang collapses. A feeble qi gives rise to muteness; terror and dread induce madness; sorrow and grief scorch the heart, forming accumulations. If one can eliminate these five, one aligns with the numinous brightness. The numinous brightness resides within; when one attains what is within, the five viscera are at peace, thoughts are level, ears and eyes are keen, sinews and bones are strong and sturdy, one is open and unobstructed without perversity, firm and unyielding without depletion. There is no excess, nothing beyond reach.\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet water embodies the Dao. Its breadth is boundless, its depth unfathomable; its length stretches without end, its far-reaching ripples without limit. It exhales and diminishes, yet its increase and decrease surpass all reckoning. Above, it becomes the rain and dew of heaven; below, it moistens and nourishes the earth. The myriad things cannot but grow; the hundred affairs cannot but be accomplished. It embraces all living things without partiality, bestowing moisture even upon the crawling and wriggling without seeking repayment. It enriches the world without exhaustion, bestows virtue upon the people without depletion. Its course cannot be exhausted, its subtlety cannot be grasped. Struck, it is not wounded; pierced, it is not injured; severed, it is not cut; scorched, it is not burned. Supple and yielding, flowing and following, it cannot be scattered or dispersed. Its sharpness pierces metal and stone; its strength pervades the world, yet it remains ever sufficient. It takes and gives to all things without preference, without partiality or impartiality, vast and equal to heaven and earth—this is called utmost virtue.\n\nThat by which water achieves its utmost virtue is its suppleness and smoothness. Thus it is said: \"The softest in the world gallops through the hardest; nothing enters where there is no gap.\" The formless is the great ancestor of things; the soundless is the great origin of tones. The true person communicates with the numinous treasury, becoming one with creation. Holding the mysterious virtue in the heart, their transformations move like spirits. Therefore, the Dao that cannot be spoken is vast and boundless. Before issuing commands or decrees, it shifts customs and alters mores—this is the work of the heart alone.\n\nAll things have their source, yet only the root is upheld; all affairs have their origin, yet only the gate is guarded. Thus one can exhaust the inexhaustible, reach the unreachable, illuminate things without reflection, respond without knowing.\n\nLaozi said: \"In the Way and its virtue, the will is weak yet the affairs are strong; the heart is empty yet the response is fitting. The weak will is soft, delicate, tranquil, and still, concealed in non-acquisition, enacted in inability. Serene and inactive, moving without missing the moment—thus the noble must take the humble as its root, the high must take the low as its foundation. Relying on the small, it encompasses the great; residing within, it governs without. Acting with softness yet firmness, its strength overcomes all; no enemy can subdue it, no opposition can surpass it. Those who desire firmness must guard with softness; those who desire strength must preserve with weakness. Accumulated softness becomes firmness; accumulated weakness becomes strength. Observe what is accumulated to know survival or ruin.\n\nStrength that overcomes what is weaker than oneself reaches its limit when encountering its equal; softness that overcomes what surpasses oneself has power beyond measure. Thus, when armies are strong, they perish; when trees are strong, they break; when leather is strong, it tears. The teeth, though harder than the tongue, perish first. Therefore, softness and weakness are the trunk of life; firmness and strength are the companions of death. Those who lead perish; those who follow reach their destination. Thus, those who grasp the Dao to adapt to change—whether first or last—control the other. How can they not prevail? What controls them cannot be controlled in return.\n\nWhat is called 'following' is to harmonize with the reckoning and align with the timing. When the moment shifts, there is no room for hesitation. To act first is to overreach; to act later is to fall short. The sun revolves, the moon cycles—time does not wait for people. Thus, the sage does not value a foot-long jade but treasures an inch of time. Time is hard to obtain yet easily lost, so the sage acts in accord with the moment, achieves success by relying on resources, upholds the pure Dao, restrains with feminine restraint, follows and responds to change, always remaining behind yet never ahead. With softness and stillness, tranquility and stability, their achievements are vast, and nothing firm can contend with them.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When the heart harbors scheming, purity is no longer unsullied, and the numinous virtue is not whole within the person. How can one who does not know how distant they are from harm embrace it? When the heart forgets desires and harmful intentions, even a hungry tiger can be tailed—how much more so with people?\n\nThose who embody the Dao are at ease yet not exhausted; those who rely on calculation labor without achievement. Those who enact laws, carve punishments, and execute penalties do not engage in the work of emperors and kings. Those who frequently employ whips and restraints do not govern for the long term. When likes and dislikes are many, calamities follow. Thus, the laws of the former kings were not what they created but what they followed; their prohibitions and punishments were not what they enacted but what they upheld. Therefore, by following, the great is achieved; by upholding, stability is secured. To act is to fail.\n\nRelying on ears and eyes to listen and see wearies the heart and obscures clarity; governing with cunning and planning exhausts the heart and yields no success. Relying on one person’s talent is insufficient for great governance; one person’s ability cannot manage even three acres of land. Following the principles of the Dao and relying on the naturalness of heaven and earth, even the six directions are not enough to equalize. Hearing is misled by praise and blame; the eyes are seduced by colors. Ritual and sincerity are insufficient to dispel attachment; only a sincere heart can embrace the distant.\n\nThus, nothing is sharper than the will; the sword Moye is inferior. No bandit is greater than yin and yang, yet the drumstick is small. What is called the great bandit lies hidden without words, its violence concealed in the mountains; the small bandit lurks among the people. Therefore, when the people abound in cunning and skill, strange things arise; when laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits multiply. Abandoning one and taking the other, heavenly calamities do not arise. Thus, governing the state with wisdom is the state’s thief; not governing the state with wisdom is the state’s virtue.\n\nThe formless is greater than the formed; the formless is more numerous than the formed; the formless is stronger than the formed; the formless is full, while the formed is empty. The formed is the completion of affairs; the formless is the beginning of creation. The completion of affairs produces vessels; the beginning of creation is without form.\"",
      "overlap_context": "and things all passes through a single aperture; the root of a hundred affairs all emerges from a single gate. Thus, the sage establishes a single measure and follows the track, not altering the constant, not changing the norm. He takes the plumb line as his standard, the marking cord as his guide, bending with what is straight, straightening with what is constant. Joy and anger are perversions of the Dao; sorrow and grief are corruptions of virtue; likes and dislikes are excesses of the heart.\"",

The formed arises from the formless, thus the formless is the beginning of the formed.\n\nVastness and thickness possess names—those with names are prized for wholeness. Frugality and thinness lack names—those without names are held cheap and light. Abundance and wealth possess names—those with names are honored and cherished. Poverty and scarcity lack names—those without names are base and humiliated. The male possesses names—those with names are manifest and illustrious. The female lacks names—those without names are subtle and restrained. Surplus possesses names—those with names are exalted and wise. Deficiency lacks names—those without names are tasked with lowly work. Merit brings names; lack of merit brings no names. Names arise from the nameless; the nameless is the mother of names.\n\nThus, the Dao gives rise to being and non-being, difficulty and ease complete one another. Therefore, the sage holds to the Dao, embracing emptiness, stillness, subtlety, and mystery to perfect their virtue. Where there is the Dao, there is virtue; where there is virtue, there is merit; where there is merit, there is name; where there is name, there is a return to the Dao. Merit and name endure long, and one remains free from blame throughout life. Kings and lords possess merit and name; the orphaned and widowed lack merit and name. Thus, the sage calls themselves orphaned and widowed, returning to their root. Merit is achieved yet not possessed, thus merit is made into benefit, and namelessness is put to use.\n\nIn ancient times, the people were simple and artless, not knowing east from west.

      "translated_text": "The Power of Sincerity\n\nLaozi said: Heaven attains its height; Earth attains its depth. The sun and moon shine, the stars array themselves, yin and yang harmonize—not through deliberate action, but by aligning with the Dao so that things arise naturally. Yin and yang, the four seasons, do not generate the myriad things; rain and dew descend in their time, not to nurture grasses and trees. When spirit and illumination connect, yin and yang harmonize, and the myriad things are born.\n\nThe Dao conceals essence within and harbors spirit in the heart. Still and silent, serene and joyous, the breast is vast and formless, hushed and soundless. The offices appear as if empty; the court appears as if unpeopled. There are no cunning scholars, no idle folk, no forced labor, no unjust punishments. All under heaven look up to the virtue of their ruler, emulating the sovereign’s restraint. Distant lands and alien customs, though far removed, all come through repeated translation—not because the ruler visits each household and meets each person, but because he extends his sincere heart to all under heaven. Thus, rewarding the good and punishing the violent is the proper command, yet what enables its execution is the power of sincerity. Though the command be clear, it cannot act alone; it must await sincerity. Therefore, when the Dao is applied to govern the people yet the people do not follow, it is because sincerity has not reached them.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven establishes the sun and moon, arrays the stars, unfolds the four seasons, and regulates yin and yang. By day it exposes things, by night it lets them rest; with wind it dries them, with rain and dew it moistens them. In generating things, none see its nurturance, yet the myriad things grow. In destroying things, none see its prevention, yet the myriad things perish. This is called spirit illumination. Thus, the sage emulates it: when fortune arises, none see its cause, yet fortune arises; when misfortune is removed, none see its source, yet misfortune departs. Investigating it, one finds nothing; examining it, one discovers no emptiness. Daily reckoning falls short, yet yearly reckoning exceeds. Silent and soundless, a single word stirs all under heaven—this is the movement of transformation without intent.\n\nThus, when sincerity takes form within, qi stirs in heaven: auspicious stars appear, yellow dragons descend, phoenixes arrive, sweet springs flow, fine grains grow, the rivers do not overflow, the seas do not surge. But when one defies heaven and harms things, the sun and moon suffer eclipse, the five stars lose their course, the four seasons clash, daylight darkens and night shines, mountains collapse, rivers run dry, winter thunders, summer frosts. Heaven and humanity communicate thus: when a state perishes, celestial omens change; when customs decay, rainbows appear. All things are interconnected, essence and qi press upon one another. Therefore, the affairs of spirit illumination cannot be achieved through cunning or force. Thus, the great person joins virtue with heaven and earth, aligns illumination with the sun and moon, unites numinosity with gods and spirits, and harmonizes trust with the four seasons. Embracing the heart of heaven, holding the qi of earth, grasping the mean and containing harmony, without leaving the hall, he traverses the four seas, transforms customs, and alters habits. The people change toward goodness as if it arose from themselves—this is the power of spiritual transformation.\n\nLaozi said: Those who enter the Dao preserve their nature and safeguard their authenticity, not harming their persons. When pressed by urgency or difficulty, their essence communicates with heaven. As for those who have never departed from their origin—what could they not accomplish? Death and life share the same realm; they cannot be coerced. How much less can one coerce the governance of heaven and earth, the stewardship of the myriad things, the return to transformation, and the containment of supreme harmony? They have never known death or life.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood by others without—this is the unerring Dao. When the sage rules from above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and great indeed! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, treachery and deceit become manifest.",

      "translated_text": "The celestial spirits and qi respond in mutual resonance—this is called the eloquence of wordlessness, the Way that cannot be spoken. To summon the distant, employ non-action; to draw near, speak of no affairs. Only those who wander in the night can attain this. Thus, horses are turned back to fertilize fields, and the tracks of carts do not reach beyond distant lands—this is called \"sitting in stillness while racing, sinking while afloat.\" The Way of heaven is impartial in approach, impartial in departure. The capable have surplus; the inept fall short. Those who follow it prosper; those who oppose it perish. Therefore, governing with cleverness makes it difficult to sustain the state. Only those who align with the Great Harmony and uphold natural resonance can attain it.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao and virtue are like leather and hide—distance makes them seem close, closeness makes them seem distant. Scrutinize them, and they cannot be grasped; examine them, and they are not empty. Thus, the sage is like a mirror: neither advancing nor retreating, responding without hoarding, engaging with the myriad things without harming them. In gaining, there is loss; in losing, there is gain. Therefore, those who penetrate the Great Harmony are dim as if drunk, sweetly reclining to wander within it, as if never having departed from their origin—this is called the Great Permeation. This is the art of employing non-employment to achieve its use.\n\nLaozi said: In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor governed the world by harmonizing the movements of the sun and moon, regulating the qi of yin and yang, ordering the measures of the four seasons, rectifying the numbers of pitch pipes and calendars, distinguishing male and female, clarifying superior and inferior, ensuring the strong did not oppress the weak, the many did not bully the few, the people preserved their lives without premature death, the seasons ripened without calamity, the hundred officials were upright and impartial, superiors and inferiors were harmonious without grievance, laws and commands were clear and not obscure, assistants were just and not sycophantic, farmers yielded boundaries, roads were free of lost items, and markets had no false pricing. In this time, the sun, moon, and stars did not deviate from their courses; wind and rain came in season; the five grains flourished; phoenixes soared in the courtyards; qilin roamed the outskirts.\n\nWhen Fuxi ruled the world, he slept on stone and rested on rope, killed in autumn, stored in winter, embraced the square earth and held the round heaven. Where yin and yang stagnated and obstructed, he opened the pathways; where qi rebelled and harmed the people, he severed and halted it. The people were like children, unaware of east or west, their eyes dim, their steps stumbling, yet blissfully content, unaware of their origins. They drifted and floated, unknowing of their roots, nourishing themselves without knowing where they went. In this time, birds and beasts, insects and snakes, all sheathed their claws and fangs, concealed their stings and poisons. His work measured up to heaven and earth. Yet the Yellow Emperor, though inferior to the Great Ancestor, did not display his achievements or exalt his name. This is the Way of the Perfected Person—following the inherent constancy of heaven and earth. Why? Because the Dao and virtue ascend, while cleverness vanishes.\n\nLaozi said: If heaven is unsettled, the sun and moon have nothing to bear; if earth is unsettled, grasses and trees have nowhere to stand; if the self is not at peace, right and wrong have no form. Thus, only with the Perfected Person does true wisdom arise. What they uphold is not brightness—how can one know what I call knowledge? Is it not ignorance? Accumulating jujubes and piling goods to make the people joyful and delight in life is benevolence. Establishing great merit, displaying illustrious names, embodying the proper relationship between ruler and minister, clarifying superior and inferior, ordering kin and strangers, rescuing endangered states, restoring extinguished lineages, and establishing heirs for those without descendants is righteousness. Closing the nine orifices, concealing the will and intent, discarding cleverness and returning to non-discernment, wandering beyond the dust and grime, roaming in the realm of no affairs, inhaling yin and exhaling yang to harmonize with the myriad things—this is virtue. Thus, the Dao disperses into virtue, virtue overflows into benevolence and righteousness, and once benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue decay.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters, words become flowery; when virtue dissipates, actions become false. When the utmost essence is absent within, yet words and deeds are observed without, one cannot avoid being enslaved by things. When essence is exhausted and actions are without limit, what is guarded is unstable, and one is seduced by the winds of世俗. Thus, the sage cultivates the Dao and its arts within and does not outwardly adorn benevolence and righteousness. Knowing the proper use of the nine orifices and four limbs, they wander in the harmony of the spirit—this is the sage’s defense.\n\nLaozi said: As for the sage’s wandering, it is movement in utmost emptiness, the mind roaming in the great void, racing beyond boundaries, acting through no gate, listening to no sound, seeing no form, unbound by the world, unshackled by俗. Thus, what the sage uses to move the world is not the Perfected Person; what the worthy use to correct世俗 is not the sage. Those bound by世俗 must have their forms constrained and spirits fettered, and thus cannot avoid entanglement. If I can be bound and shackled, my fate must lie in what is external.\n\nLaozi said: When the ruler’s thoughts are not scattered in the mind, and wisdom does not extend beyond the four domains, embracing a heart of benevolence and sincerity, sweet rain falls in season, the five grains flourish, spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores, the moon reviews the seasons, and at year’s end, tribute is offered. Nourishing the people with impartiality, authority is stern without admonition, laws are few without excess, teachings are divine, punishments are lenient, prisons are empty, and the world is of one custom, with no one harboring wicked intentions—this is the sage’s grace.\n\nWhen superiors covet without measure, inferiors vie for merit without yielding; the people grow poor and suffer, giving rise to strife; their strength is exhausted without result; cunning and deceit sprout; thieves and bandits multiply; superiors and inferiors resent each other; orders are not followed. When water is muddy, fish gasp; when governance is harsh, the people rebel. When superiors are greedy, inferiors are deceitful; when superiors are restless, inferiors are unsettled; when superiors demand much, inferiors contend. Not addressing the root but rescuing at the end is no different from digging a ditch to stop water or carrying firewood to extinguish fire. The sage’s affairs are few and well-governed; their demands are few and sufficient. Without acting, there is benevolence; without speaking, there is trust; without seeking, there is attainment; without striving, there is accomplishment. Embracing naturalness, preserving utmost truth, holding the Dao, and extending sincerity, the world follows like an echo responding to sound, a shadow resembling form. What they cultivate is the root.\n\nLaozi said: When the spirit scatters outward and wisdom and thoughts dissipate within, one cannot govern the body. What the spirit employs is distant, and what it abandons is near. Thus, one does not step beyond the door to know the world, does not peer through the window to know the Way of heaven. The farther one goes, the less one knows—this speaks of essence and sincerity issuing from within, spirit and qi moving heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The yang of winter’s sun, the yin of summer’s shade—all things return to them without being summoned, reaching their utmost naturally. The response of utmost essence comes unbidden, departs without going, deep and serene, unknowing of its actions, yet its work is accomplished. Relying on the eyes to see and words to command makes governance difficult.",

They have never known death or life.\n\nSincerity takes form within and is understood by others without—this is the unerring Dao. When the sage rules from above, embracing the Dao without speaking, his beneficence extends to the myriad people. Thus, the teaching without words—vast and great indeed! When ruler and minister diverge in heart, treachery and deceit become manifest.",

      "translated_text": "Gao Yao was mute yet served as the Grand Judge, and the realm knew no cruel punishments—what need was there for speech? Shi Kuang was blind yet served as the Grand Minister, and the state of Jin knew no chaotic governance—what need was there for sight? The commands of the wordless, the vision of the sightless—this is how the sage becomes a teacher. The people’s transformation by their superiors does not follow their words but their conduct. Thus, when a ruler delights in valor yet does not restrain contention, the state will face many calamities, and in time, there will surely be the chaos of robbery and murder. When a ruler delights in beauty yet does not curb licentious talk, the state will fall into disorder, and over time, there will be the disasters of excess and dissipation.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s essence and sincerity are distinguished within, while likes and dislikes are made clear without. Words are issued to match the heart, and decrees are proclaimed to clarify intent. Thus, punishments are insufficient to shift customs, and executions are insufficient to prohibit villainy. Only spiritual transformation is prized; utmost essence becomes spirit. Where essence moves, it is like the spring’s growth or the autumn’s withering. Thus, the noble person is like an archer: here, a hair’s breadth; there, a fathom’s span. Therefore, those who govern others must be cautious in how they influence them.\n\nLaozi said: Laws are suspended and rewards are set, yet customs cannot be changed—this is because the heart does not embrace sincerity. Thus, hearing one’s tone reveals their customs; observing their music reveals their manners; seeing their manners reveals their transformation. Those who hold fast to truth and manifest sincerity move heaven and earth, and spirits transcend boundaries. Commands are obeyed, and prohibitions are heeded. Sincerity penetrates the Way and conveys its meaning. Though not a word is spoken, the world’s myriad people, birds, beasts, and spirits transform with it. Thus, the highest governance is spiritual transformation; the next is preventing wrongdoing; the lowest is rewarding the worthy and punishing the violent.\n\nLaozi said: The Great Way is non-action. Non-action means non-possession; non-possession means not abiding. Not abiding means dwelling without form; without form means not moving; not moving means no speech. No speech means stillness without sound. Without form, it cannot be seen; without sound, it cannot be heard—this is called the subtle and wondrous, the utmost spirit. Vast and continuous, it is called the root of heaven and earth. The Way is without form or sound, so the sage forces a form upon it, naming it with a single word. The Way of heaven and earth is great, yet it takes the small as its root; it is abundant, yet it takes the few as its beginning. The Son of Heaven takes heaven and earth as his standard and the myriad things as his resources. His merit and virtue are vast, his power and fame are supreme—the beauty of these two virtues matches heaven and earth. Thus, one cannot but model the Great Way as the mother of the world.\n\nLaozi said: Relieving the poor and aiding the distressed brings fame; removing harm and eliminating calamities achieves merit. In a world without disasters, even sages have no place to apply their virtue; when superiors and inferiors are harmonious, even the worthy have no place to establish their merit. Thus, the governance of the perfected person embraces virtue, holds to the Way, extends sincerity, delights in giving, and possesses boundless wisdom. They rest in silence and do not speak, yet the world does not know how to value their wordlessness. Thus, the Way that can be spoken is not the constant Way; the name that can be named is not the constant name. What is inscribed on bamboo and silk, carved into metal and stone, or transmitted to others—these are but its coarse aspects.\n\nThe Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and Three Kings pursued different affairs with the same heart and took different paths to the same end. Scholars of later ages do not understand the embodiment of the Way or the summation of the One Virtue. They seek only the traces of accomplished deeds, kneeling and sitting to discourse on them. Though learned and widely informed, they cannot avoid chaos.\n\nLaozi said: The essence of the heart can spiritually transform but cannot be spoken of as the Way. The sage does not rise from his seat yet rectifies the world—his influence is more urgent than a shout. Thus, shared words are trusted because trust precedes the words; shared commands are obeyed because sincerity lies beyond the commands. When the sage is above, the people transform as if by spirit. When emotions precede them and move above yet find no response below, it is because emotions and commands differ. A three-month-old infant knows neither benefit nor harm, yet the loving mother cherishes it all the more—this is the power of emotion. Thus, the use of words brings change, but the change is small; the use of silence brings change, and the change is great. Trusting the noble person’s words and being loyal to their intent—loyalty and trust take shape within and move responses without. This is the transformation of the worthy and sage.\n\nLaozi said: A son’s death for his father or a minister’s death for his lord is not to seek fame by dying. Kindness is stored within and does not shirk hardship. The noble person’s sorrow is not feigned—it arises from within. One must also examine their conduct. The sage is not ashamed before shadows; the noble person is cautious in solitude. Abandoning the near to seek the distant is obstruction. Thus, when the sage is above, the people delight in his governance; when below, the people long for his will, never forgetting his desire to benefit others.\n\nLaozi said: A brave warrior’s shout makes the three armies retreat—this is the power of his sincerity. If one sings and none harmonize, or gives orders and none carry them out, there must be discord within. Thus, to rectify the world without rising from one’s seat is to seek it within oneself. Where persuasion does not reach, demeanor does; where demeanor does not reach, subtle influence does; where subtle influence reaches the heart and takes form, essence is at its utmost—it can be met in form but cannot be awaited with expectation.\n\nLaozi said: Words have their source; affairs have their root. Losing their source and root, even with many skills, is not as good as few words. To harm the many, Ruo cut off his finger to show that great skill cannot be forced. Thus, the wise craftsman does not rely on ability but on timing. Not knowing when to close, he must block before opening.\n\nLaozi said: The sage’s undertakings take different paths to the same end. Survival and ruin, stability and collapse—all are as one to the unwavering mind, never forgetting the desire to benefit others. Thus, the songs of Qin, Chu, Yan, and Wei differ in sound yet all bring joy; the wails of the Nine Yi and Eight Di differ in sound yet all bring sorrow. Song is the manifestation of joy; wailing is the manifestation of sorrow. What is within is expressed without—thus, it depends on how one influences them. The sage’s heart day and night does not forget the desire to benefit others, and the reach of his influence is far indeed.\n\nLaozi said: When people practice non-action, there is governance; when they practice action, there is harm. Those who govern through non-action yet act harm non-action. Those who cannot practice non-action cannot practice action. When people are wordless, the spirit has words—yet those who harm wordlessness by speaking injure the spirit’s spirituality.\n\nWenzi said: Names can be forcibly established; merits can be forcibly achieved. In the past, Nanrong Chu felt ashamed that the sagely Way was lacking in himself. He went south to see Laozi and received a single teaching. His spirit became enlightened, his troubles dissolved, and his thoughts flowed smoothly. He toiled for ten days without eating, as if feasting on grand offerings. Thus, his brilliance illuminated the world, his name endured through later ages, his wisdom and strategies spanned heaven and earth, and his discernment was as fine as autumn hairs. His praise spread throughout China and the barbarian lands, continuing to this day without cease—this is what it means to forcibly establish a name.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, if farmers do not strive, their granaries will not be full; if officials do not exert themselves, their sincerity will not be refined; if generals and ministers do not strengthen themselves, their achievements will not be accomplished; if kings and marquises grow lax, their names will not endure in later ages. The perfected person moves in concealment, like thunder and lightning held in reserve—acting in accord with the times, establishing merit through available resources, advancing and retreating without difficulty, and penetrating all things without obstruction.\n\nThe perfected person’s essence and sincerity take form within, and their virtue flows to the four directions. Seeing benefit in the world, they rejoice without forgetting; seeing harm in the world, they are vigilant as if on guard. Those who sorrow with the people’s sorrows will have the people sorrow with their sorrows; those who delight in the people’s joys will have the people delight in their joys. Thus, to sorrow with the world and delight with the world—yet not become king—has never been known.\n\nThe sage’s method begins where it cannot be seen and ends where it cannot be reached, abiding in an unshakable place, accumulating in an inexhaustible storehouse, and bearing its load in an unfailing treasury. Their decrees issue forth like the source of flowing water, guiding the people to offices of no contention, opening gates that must be entered, not attempting what cannot be accomplished, not seeking what cannot be obtained, not dwelling where one cannot remain, and not acting where one cannot return.\n\nThe great person enacts a governance that brings delight, and none fail to follow their commands. When commands are followed, one progresses from the small to the great; when commands are defied, good becomes harm and success becomes failure. The so-called great person is inwardly strong and outwardly luminous—internally strong like heaven and earth, externally luminous like the sun and moon. Heaven and earth cover and bear all without fail; the sun and moon illuminate all without exception. The great person reveals goodness to others without altering their fundamental nature or changing their constant principles. The world obeys their decrees as grass bends to the wind.\n\nWhen governance falters in spring, Jupiter’s movements shrink or expand without constancy. When governance falters in summer, Mars moves in retrograde. When governance falters in autumn, Venus appears where it should not, its movements erratic. When governance falters in winter, Mercury fails to appear in its proper quarter. When the four seasons lose their proper governance, Saturn sways unsteadily, the sun and moon display portents, the five planets rebel in disorder, and comets appear.\n\nWhen spring governance is not lost, millet and grain flourish. When summer governance is not lost, timely rains descend. When autumn governance is not lost, the people prosper. When winter governance is not lost, the state enjoys peace and well-being.\n\n**Nine Observances**\n\nLaozi said: Before heaven and earth took form, there was only a profound, indistinct vastness—undifferentiated, silent, and clear. The heavy and turbid became earth; the refined and subtle became heaven. Separating, they formed the four seasons; dividing, they became yin and yang. Essence-qi became humans; coarse qi became insects. Through the interplay of hardness and softness, the myriad things were born.\n\nSpirit originates in heaven; bones and skeleton are rooted in earth. Spirit enters its gate; bones and skeleton return to their root. What, then, remains of me? Thus, the sage models heaven and follows earth, unbound by custom or swayed by others. They take heaven as father, earth as mother, yin and yang as guiding principles, and the four seasons as their order.\n\nHeaven is still and clear; earth is settled and tranquil. Those who oppose the myriad things perish; those who follow them live. Thus, stillness and silence are the abode of spirit and illumination; emptiness and nothingness are the dwelling of the Dao.\n\nSpirit and essence are what one receives from heaven; bones and skeleton are what one is endowed with from earth. The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things. The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang, blending their qi to achieve harmony.\n\nLaozi said: Humans receive the transformations of heaven and earth and are born. In the first month, the essence congeals; in the second, blood and vessels form; in the third, the embryo takes shape; in the fourth, the fetus develops; in the fifth, the sinews form; in the sixth, the bones harden; in the seventh, the body is fully formed; in the eighth, it stirs; in the ninth, it becomes restless; in the tenth, it is born. Once the physical form is complete, the five viscera are differentiated: the liver governs the eyes, the kidneys govern the ears, the spleen governs the tongue, the lungs govern the nose, and the gallbladder governs the mouth.\n\nExternally, the body has its surface; internally, it has its depths. The head is round, modeling heaven; the feet are square, resembling earth. Heaven has the four seasons, five phases, nine luminaries, and three hundred sixty days; humans have four limbs, five viscera, nine orifices, and three hundred sixty joints. Heaven has wind, rain, cold, and heat; humans have taking and giving, joy and anger. The gallbladder becomes clouds, the lungs become qi, the spleen becomes wind, the kidneys become rain, and the liver becomes thunder.\n\nHumans correspond to heaven and earth, and the heart governs them. The ears and eyes are like the sun and moon; blood and qi are like wind and rain.",

      "translated_text": "When the sun and moon lose their proper courses, eclipsing and dimming their light; when wind and rain arrive unseasonably, destroying and bringing calamity; when the five stars deviate from their paths, the states and regions suffer their misfortune—such is the Dao of heaven and earth, vast and great, yet ever reliant upon moderation in its manifestations, cherishing its numinous clarity. How can human ears and eyes long endure fumigation without rest? How can the spirit gallop without exhaustion?\n\nThus the sage guards the internal and does not lose the external. Blood and qi are the blossoms of the person; the five viscera are the essence of the person. When blood and qi are concentrated within and do not stray outward, the chest and abdomen are full, and desires are few. With few desires, the ears and eyes are clear, hearing and vision acute—this is called clarity. When the five viscera are aligned with the heart and do not depart from it, qi and intent prevail, conduct is not perverse, the spirit flourishes, and qi does not scatter. Thus one hears all without fail, sees all without obstruction, and accomplishes all without hindrance. Misfortune and disaster have no means of entry, and pathogenic qi cannot invade.\n\nThose who seek much gain little; those who perceive the great know little. The orifices are the doors and windows of the spirit; blood and qi are the messengers of the five viscera. Thus when the ears and eyes are indulgent in sounds and sights, the five viscera become agitated and unsettled, blood and qi surge and do not rest, and the spirit gallops without restraint. Though calamity and fortune arrive like mountains, there is no way to recognize them.\n\nThus the sage receives without transgressing. If the sage ensures that the ears and eyes are keen and penetrating, with nothing to lure or entice, and that intent and qi are not lost, remaining pure and with few desires, the five viscera are at ease, the spirit is guarded within, and the body does not transgress. Then one may observe the external affairs of past ages and the internal matters of fortune and misfortune—all becomes clearly visible. Thus the farther one ventures outward, the less one knows. This speaks to the spirit’s inability to be externally indulgent.\n\nThe five colors confuse the eyes, rendering them unclear; the five sounds disturb the ears, rendering them unhearing; the five flavors disorder the mouth, causing it to suffer sores. Preferences and aversions confuse the heart, causing conduct to become reckless. Thus desires cause qi to become excessive, and likes and dislikes cause the spirit to labor. If one does not swiftly depart from them, aspiration and qi will daily diminish. The reason people cannot fulfill their natural lifespans is due to their excessive pursuit of life. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to thereby attain longevity.\n\nHeaven and earth move and interpenetrate; the myriad things are gathered into one. To know the One is to know all things; to be unable to know the One is to be unable to know anything. I dwell in the world as one thing among things, and things are also things. How can things be compared to one another? The desire for life cannot be pursued; the aversion to death cannot be avoided. To despise the lowly cannot be resented; to rejoice in the noble cannot be delighted in. Following one’s endowment and settling into it without daring to exceed it—this is the utmost joy. Guarding emptiness, Laozi said:\n\nThe so-called sage follows the times and is at ease in their position, content with their lot in the present age. Grief and joy are perversions of virtue; likes and dislikes are burdens of the heart; joy and anger are transgressions of the Dao. In life, one follows the movement of heaven; in death, one transforms with things. At rest, one harmonizes with yin; in motion, one moves with yang. Thus the heart is the master of the body, and the spirit is the treasure of the heart. If the body labors without rest, it stumbles; if essence is used without cease, it is exhausted. Therefore the sage abides by this and does not transgress. Responding to the insubstantial with the substantial, one must exhaust its principles; receiving the real with the empty, one must fathom its limits. Serene and joyful, empty and still, one fulfills their mandate. Without estrangement or partiality, embracing virtue and nurturing harmony, one accords with heaven, joins with the Dao as their boundary, and neighbors with virtue. They do not initiate fortune, nor do they precede calamity. Life and death bring no change to them. Thus it is said: the utmost spirit seeks and obtains all without fail, accomplishing all without hindrance.\n\nGuarding Emptiness, Laozi said:\nTo regard the world lightly is to keep the spirit unburdened; to treat the myriad things as trivial is to keep the heart unconfused. Equalizing life and death, intent is not daunted; unifying transformation, clarity is not obscured. The perfected person leans upon an unyielding pillar, walks an unobstructed path, draws from an inexhaustible storehouse, and studies with an undying teacher. They go nowhere without success, reach nowhere without penetration. In bending and stretching, rising and lowering, they embrace their fate without confusion, and misfortune and fortune, benefit and harm are insufficient to trouble their heart.\n\nThose who act with righteousness may be compelled by benevolence but cannot be coerced by arms; they may be rectified by righteousness but cannot be lured by profit. The noble person dies for righteousness and cannot be detained by wealth or nobility. Those who act with righteousness cannot be frightened by death—how much more so for those who practice non-action? Those who practice non-action are without burdens. The burdenless person regards the world as their shadow and echo. Observing the ranks of the perfected above, deeply tracing the intent of the Dao and virtue, and examining the conduct of the vulgar below, one is sufficiently ashamed. Those who do not treat the world as something to be used are like those who study by beating the war drum.\n\nGuarding Equilibrium, Laozi said:\nEsteeming power and coveting profit are what people desire. Compared to the body, these are base. Thus the sage eats enough to fill the belly and sustain qi, wears enough to cover the body and ward off cold, and satisfies their emotions while rejecting excess. They do not covet gain or accumulate much. With clear eyes that do not see and still ears that do not hear, they close their mouths and do not speak, relinquish their hearts and do not ponder. Abandoning cleverness and returning to simplicity, resting the spirit and forsaking knowledge—thus they have no preferences and no aversions. This is called the Great Penetration. To eliminate obstacles and remove burdens, nothing surpasses never having departed from one’s origin. What cannot be accomplished? To know the harmony of nurturing life is not to be lured by profit; to understand the correspondence of internal and external is not to be enticed by power. The external of the external is the greatest; the internal of the internal is the most noble. To know great nobility, where does one not succeed?\n\nGuarding Simplicity, Laozi said:\nThe ancients who practiced the Dao ordered their natures and governed their hearts, nurturing with harmony and maintaining with suitability. Delighting in the Dao, they forgot lowliness; content with virtue, they forgot poverty. In their nature, there was nothing they desired; if they did not desire, they did not obtain it. In their hearts, there was nothing they rejoiced in; if they did not rejoice, they did not do it. What did not benefit their nature, they did not burden their virtue with; what was not conducive to life, they did not disturb their harmony with. They did not indulge their bodies or give free rein to their intentions, yet their regulations could serve as models for the world. They ate according to their bellies’ measure, clothed themselves according to their bodies’ form, dwelled in accord with their bodies, and acted in accord with their emotions. They relinquished the world without possessing it, entrusted the myriad things without profiting from them. How could poverty or wealth, nobility or lowliness cause them to lose their nature and life? Those who can do this may be said to embody the Dao.\n\nGuarding Clarity, Laozi said:\nHumans receive qi from heaven. The ears and eyes’ relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth’s relation to fragrances and odors, the skin’s relation to cold and warmth—these are all the same in essence. Yet some die, some live; some become noble persons, some petty persons. The distinctions lie in their regulations. The spirit is the abyss of wisdom; when the spirit is clear, wisdom is bright. Wisdom is the storehouse of the heart; when wisdom is impartial, the heart is level.\n\nNo one mirrors themselves in flowing water but in still water, for it is clear and tranquil. Thus when the spirit is clear and intent is level, one can perceive the essence of things. Those who employ it must borrow from those who do not. A bright mirror is not marred by dust; a clear spirit is not misled by desires. Thus when the heart reaches a point, the spirit is surely present; returning to emptiness, agitation dissipates and the storehouse of rest is sealed. This is the wandering of the sage. Therefore, to govern the world, one must first understand the essence of nature and life.\n\nThen one may proceed.",

      "translated_text": "To Preserve the True\n\nLaozi said: What is called the sage merely accords with the genuine. Measuring the belly to eat, gauging the form to clothe—restraining the self so that covetous and corrupt thoughts have no means to arise. Thus one who can possess the world must not treat the world as a possession; one who can attain fame and reputation must not seek them through transgressive conduct. Truly comprehending the essence of nature and life, benevolence and righteousness naturally adhere.\n\nAs for the spirit, nothing obscures it; the heart, nothing burdens it—penetrating and unimpeded, flowing in perfect clarity, serene and without affair. Power and profit cannot lure it; sound and beauty cannot seduce it; eloquence cannot persuade it; cunning cannot move it; courage cannot frighten it. This is the wandering of the true person.\n\nThat which gives life does not live; that which transforms does not transform. Those who do not grasp this Dao—though they command the governance of heaven and earth, illuminate like the sun and moon, untie linked rings, or make their words shine like metal and stone—still gain no benefit in governing the world. Thus the sage does not lose what they preserve.\n\nTo Preserve Stillness\n\nLaozi said: Stillness, silence, tranquility, and simplicity—these nurture life. Harmony, joy, emptiness, and nothingness—these uphold virtue. Externally undisturbed, internally one attains nature and finds its proper place. Still and unmoving, harmonious and at ease, virtue rests in its position. Nurturing life to order the world, embracing virtue to fulfill one’s years—this may be called embodying the Dao.\n\nThose who are thus have blood and vessels free from stagnation, the five organs free from accumulated qi. Fortune and misfortune cannot deceive; praise and blame cannot defile. Without possessing the world, who could bring it to order? Possessing talent but not meeting the times, the self cannot even escape—how much less one without the Dao?\n\nThe eye that discerns the tip of an autumn hair cannot hear the sound of thunder; the ear that harmonizes the tones of gold and jade cannot see the form of Mount Tai. Thus when the small is held in mind, the great is forgotten.\n\nNow the myriad things assail, blocking our life, seizing our essence like a spring’s source. Though one may wish not to receive them, how is it possible?\n\nIf a basin of water is clear, after a day one can see the brows and lashes; if muddied, even with a single stir one cannot discern square from round. The human spirit is difficult to keep clear and easy to muddy—just like the water in the basin. Preserve the method.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The highest sage models Heaven; the next esteems worthies; the lowest employs ministers. To employ ministers is the way of peril and ruin; to esteem worthies is the source of delusion and confusion. To model Heaven is the Dao of ordering Heaven and Earth. Emptiness and stillness are its foundation—emptiness admits nothing, stillness holds all. Only by knowing the Dao of emptiness and stillness can one endure from beginning to end. Thus the sage takes stillness as governance and movement as disorder. Therefore it is said: Do not disturb, do not agitate, and the myriad things will clear themselves; do not alarm, do not frighten, and the myriad things will order themselves. This is called the Heavenly Dao.\n\n**Preserve Weakness**\nLaozi said: The Son of Heaven and the feudal lords take the world and a single state as their household, and the myriad things as their storehouse. With the vastness of the world and the multitude of the myriad things, their qi becomes full and their aspirations arrogant. The great use troops to invade the small; the small are haughty and domineering toward those below. Their minds are extravagant and expansive—like whirlwinds and violent rains, they cannot last long. Thus the sage governs with the Dao, holding to the One and practicing non-action, without diminishing. The qi of the Unfathomable appears small and preserves softness; it retreats and does not possess. It models itself on the rivers and seas—the rivers and seas do not act, yet their fame and merit transform naturally. They do not strive, thus they can perfect their kingship. Being the female of the world, they can spiritually endure without perishing. Loving themselves, they can perfect their nobility. The power of ten thousand chariots and the achievements of the myriad things—authority and responsibility are most weighty. One cannot treat oneself lightly; to treat oneself lightly is to fail in fame and merit. The Dao is great, yet it is completed through the small; it is abundant, yet it takes the few as its master. Thus the sage governs the world with the Dao. The subtlety of softness and weakness lies in perceiving the small; frugality and thrift lie in perceiving the few. Perceiving the small, one can perfect the great; perceiving the few, one can perfect the beautiful. The Dao of Heaven suppresses the high and elevates the low; it diminishes excess and supplements insufficiency. The rivers and seas occupy the lowest places, thus the world returns to them and offers them tribute. The sage is humble, tranquil, yielding, and modest—these are the signs of lowness. An empty mind and nothingness are the signs of insufficiency. Perceiving lowness, one can attain the high; perceiving insufficiency, one can perfect worthiness. The haughty do not stand; the extravagant do not endure. The violent die; the self-satisfied perish. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last the day; small valleys cannot hold for a moment. Whirlwinds and violent rains embody the qi of violence, thus they cannot last and perish. Small valleys occupy the place of violence, thus they cannot but be seized. Therefore the sage holds to the female and the yielding, abandons extravagance and arrogance, and does not dare to act with violent qi. Holding to the female and the yielding, one can establish one’s maleness; not daring to be extravagant and arrogant, one can endure long.\n\n**Laozi said:** The Dao of Heaven reaches its extreme and then returns; fullness is followed by loss—such are the sun and moon. Thus the sage daily diminishes and the qi of the Unfathomable does not dare to fill itself; daily advancing with the female, its power and virtue do not decline. Such is the Dao of Heaven. The nature of human emotions all favors the high and dislikes the low, favors gain and dislikes loss, favors profit and dislikes harm, favors honor and dislikes humility, favors nobility and dislikes baseness. The multitude acts accordingly, thus they cannot succeed; they grasp for it, thus they cannot obtain. Therefore the sage models Heaven, achieves without acting, and obtains without grasping. Sharing the same emotions as others but following a different Dao, he can endure long. Thus the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors had vessels of warning, called \"assisting cups.\" When empty, they stood upright; when full, they overturned. Things flourish and then decline; the sun reaches its zenith and then moves on; the moon becomes full and then wanes; joy ends in sorrow. Therefore, those with keen hearing and broad wisdom preserve them with foolishness; those with extensive learning and eloquent debate preserve them with frugality; those with martial strength and courage preserve them with awe; those with wealth and nobility preserve them with restraint; those who bestow virtue upon the world preserve it with yielding. These five were how the former kings preserved the world. Those who practice this Dao do not desire fullness. Only by not being full can one’s worn-out state not be renewed.\n\n**Laozi said:** The sage aligns with yin, closing with it; aligns with yang, opening with it. Able to reach the absence of joy, there is nothing not joyful. With nothing not joyful, one attains the ultimate joy. This is inner joy, not allowing external things to bring joy within. Thus there is self-joy, and there is self-aspiration, esteemed by the world. The reason for this is that it relies on the world to be the essential matter of the world. It does not lie in others but in oneself; it does not lie in others but in one’s own person. When the person attains it, the myriad things are complete. Therefore, those who penetrate the discourse on the art of the mind are beyond external desires, likes, and aversions. Thus there is nothing to delight in, nothing to anger, nothing to rejoice in, nothing to suffer. The myriad things are profoundly united—there is no \"not this,\" no \"that.\" Therefore, the scholar has unchanging principles; the woman has unalterable conduct. They do not rely on power to be honored, do not require wealth to be rich, do not need strength to be powerful. They do not profit from material goods, do not covet worldly fame. They do not find security in nobility nor peril in baseness. Form, spirit, qi, and aspiration each reside in their proper place. Form is the vessel of life; qi is the origin of life; spirit is the controller of life.",

      "translated_text": "A single misplacement of these three injures them all. Thus, those who take spirit as their master find form obedient and beneficial; those who take form as their master find spirit obedient yet harmful to life. The greedy and gluttonous, covetous of many desires, are ever wary of power and profit, lured by fame and rank. When one’s position is exalted above the world, the spirit daily depletes, drifting far in excess without return. When form seals itself within, resisting entry, there is no way in. Hence arises the affliction of blindness, forgetfulness, and self-loss.\n\nSpirit, aspiration, and qi—when tranquil, they daily flourish and strengthen; when restless, they daily deplete and age. Therefore, the sage preserves and nurtures the spirit, harmonizes and softens the qi, levels and pacifies the form, floating and sinking with the Dao. Thus, the transformations of the myriad things all find their counterpart; the changes of a hundred affairs all meet their response.\n\nHold to simplicity. Laozi said: The so-called \"True Person\" is one whose nature accords with the Dao. Thus, they possess yet seem empty; are full yet seem hollow. They cultivate the inner, not the outer; comprehend the Great Simplicity, practice non-action, and return to uncarved simplicity. They embody the root, embrace the spirit, and wander at the root of heaven and earth, drifting beyond the dust and grime, at ease in the work of no-affairs. Schemes, cunning, and cleverness are not carried in the heart. Discerning without reliance, not shifting with things, they perceive the transformations of affairs yet hold to their origin. The mind’s intent is concentrated within, penetrating fortune and misfortune as one. Abiding without knowing what they do, moving without knowing where they go, they know without learning, see without looking, accomplish without acting, distinguish without governing.\n\nStirred, they respond; pressed, they move; compelled, they proceed—like light’s radiance, like a shadow’s echo. Following the Dao, they depend on conditions to be so. Vast and empty, clear and still, they take no measure of a thousand lives as one, nor a myriad differences as a single origin. They possess essence yet do not employ it; have spirit yet do not use it. Guarding the great undifferentiated simplicity, they stand at the center of utmost refinement. In sleep, they do not dream; in wisdom, they do not sprout. In movement, they are formless; in stillness, they are bodiless. Present yet as if absent, alive yet as if dead, entering and exiting without gap, they command the spirits—what the spirit and essence can achieve is to ascend and borrow from the Dao.\n\nWhen spirit and essence flow freely without losing their origin, day and night without gap, they become springtime to things—this is what it means to unite and give life to the times within the heart. Thus, form may decay, yet spirit never transforms. Responding to transformation with non-transformation, through a thousand changes and ten thousand turns, it never reaches an end. The transforming returns to formlessness; the unchanging is born together with heaven and earth.\n\nThus, the living never truly live—their so-called life is but transformation. The transforming never truly transform—their so-called transformation is but change. This is the wandering of the True Person, the pure and unadulterated Dao.\n\n*Fu Yan* states: Laozi said: The Dao is supremely high, without above; profoundly deep, without below. Level as a water-level, straight as a marking-line, round as a compass, square as a carpenter’s square. It envelops heaven and earth without inside or outside, pervades and covers all without obstruction. Therefore, those who embody the Dao are neither angered nor delighted. Seated, they are without care; asleep, they do not dream. They see things yet name them not; affairs arrive, and they respond.\n\nLaozi said: Those who desire to claim fame must create affairs. Creating affairs, they abandon the public and pursue the private, betray the Dao and rely on their own views. Seeking praise, they do good; establishing a name, they act as worthies. Yet governance that does not follow principle leads to much blame; affairs that do not accord with the times yield no merit. Rashly striving to hit the mark, success is insufficient to absolve responsibility; failure is enough to destroy the self.\n\nLaozi said: Do not be the corpse of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, the master of cunning. Conceal yourself in formlessness, act without negligence. Do not precede fortune, do not initiate misfortune. Begin in formlessness, move when compelled. Desire fortune? First, be without misfortune. Desire benefit? First, distance harm. Thus, those who are tranquil through non-action—if they lose their tranquility, they fall into danger. Those who govern through non-action—if they lose their governance, they fall into chaos. Therefore, do not desire to be as busy as jade or as aloof as stone. The more ornate the pattern, the more the skin will peel; the finer the horns, the more the body will be slain. Sweet springs must run dry; straight trees must be felled. Florid words will later bring fault; stones with jade injure their mountains. The suffering of the black-haired people surely lies before their words. The reason the common folk bring calamity upon themselves is their reckless discussion of the state’s laws and standards.\n\nLaozi said: Those who act in accord with the times follow the Dao; those who do not know the Dao take fortune as misfortune, heaven as a canopy, earth as a chariot-axle. Those who skillfully use the Dao will never be exhausted. Earth as a chariot-axle, heaven as a canopy—those who skillfully use the Dao will never be harmed. Though the five phases contend, there must be a victor. What heaven covers is never unbalanced. Thus, to know without knowing is supreme; not to know yet claim to know is a flaw.\n\nLaozi said: Mountains give birth to metal, stones give birth to jade—they mutually wear each other away. Trees give birth to insects, which devour them in return. People create affairs, which harm them in turn. Those who love meddling are never without trouble; those who contend for profit are never without exhaustion. Good swimmers drown; good riders fall. Each is undone by what they love. Success lies in timing, not in contention; governance lies in the Dao, not in sagacity. Earth congeals below, does not contend for height—thus it is secure and not in danger. Water flows downward, does not contend for speed—thus it departs yet does not lag. Therefore, the sage has no attachments and thus no losses; practices non-action and thus no defeats.\n\nLaozi said: One word cannot exhaust it; two words are the world’s standard. Three words are the lords’ might; four words are the world’s harmony. Integrity and trust cannot be exhausted; virtue and the Dao are the world’s standard. Elevating worthies and virtue makes the lords mighty; hating the few and loving the many brings the world harmony.\n\nLaozi said: People meet three kinds of death not ordained by fate. Immoderate in drink and food, they belittle their bodies—disease kills them. Delighting without cease, seeking without end—punishment kills them. With few, they offend the many; with the weak, they bully the strong—weapons kill them.\n\nLaozi said: Those who bestow generously receive beautiful recompense; those who harbor great resentment suffer deep calamity. To give little yet expect much, to nurture resentment yet hope for no misfortune—such has never been. Examine what has gone, and you will know what is to come.\n\nLaozi said: Trace the mandate of heaven, govern the art of the mind, order likes and dislikes, and adapt to the nature of emotions—thus the governance of the Dao is unimpeded. Trace the mandate of heaven, and you will not be deluded by fortune and misfortune. Govern the art of the mind, and you will not recklessly rejoice or anger. Order likes and dislikes, and you will not covet the useless. Adapt to the nature of emotions, and desires will not exceed measure. Unconfused by fortune and misfortune, your movement and stillness will follow principle. Without reckless joy or anger, rewards and punishments will not be biased. Without coveting the useless, you will not harm your nature with desire. Desires not exceeding measure, you will nourish life and know contentment. These four do not seek from without nor borrow from others; turn inward, and you will obtain them.\n\nLaozi said: Do not pursue actions that can be criticized; do not resent others’ criticism of yourself. Cultivate the virtue of sufficient praise; do not seek others’ praise. You cannot prevent misfortune from arriving—trust in not welcoming it. You cannot ensure fortune will come—trust in not yielding it. Misfortune’s arrival is not of your making—thus, though impoverished, you are not sorrowful. Fortune’s coming is not of your achievement—thus, though successful, you are not proud. Therefore, dwelling in leisure, you are joyful; practicing non-action, you govern.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The Dao abides in what one already possesses and does not seek what one has yet to obtain. Seeking what one has yet to obtain, what one already has will be lost. Following what one already possesses, what one desires will arrive. Governance that relies not on preventing disorder but on maintaining order is surely precarious. Conduct that has not yet escaped wrongdoing but hastily seeks fame will surely be worn away. Thus, no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune, and no benefit is greater than the absence of defense. Some things, when augmented, are diminished; when diminished, are augmented. The Dao cannot be urged toward those who pursue profit, but it can bring tranquility to the spirit and avert harm. Therefore, one may taste the absence of misfortune but not the presence of fortune; taste the absence of guilt but not the presence of merit. The Dao says: Vast and obscure, it follows the majesty of Heaven, sharing Heaven’s qi. Without thought or planning, without preparation or storage, it does not welcome what comes nor impede what goes. Though people move east, west, south, or north, it stands alone at the center. Thus, amidst crooked multitudes, it does not lose its straightness; flowing with the world, it does not depart from its domain. It does no good, avoids no ugliness, follows Heaven’s Way, initiates nothing, does not monopolize itself, adheres to Heaven’s principle, makes no plans, does not discard the times, and takes Heaven as its measure. It seeks no gain, declines no fortune, follows Heaven’s norm. Within, there is no extraordinary fortune; without, no extraordinary misfortune. Thus, fortune and misfortune do not arise.\n\nWhen people become thieves, the highest virtue speaks with one voice, acts with one accord—above and below, hearts united, without divergence. Those who see from the roadside are turned from evil and guided toward goodness, and the people turn toward uprightness.\n\nLaozi said: To do good is to encourage; to do evil is to observe. Encouragement gives rise to reproach; observation gives rise to resentment. Thus, the Dao cannot be advanced to seek fame but can be retired to cultivate the self. Therefore, the sage does not seek fame through conduct nor reputation through knowledge and perception. Governance follows nature, and one who has nothing to do with it may yet achieve what those who strive do not attain. People may be exhausted, but the Dao is never obstructed. Those with wisdom yet practice non-action achieve the same merit as the unwise; those with ability yet do nothing possess the same virtue as the incapable. Wise yet appearing unwise, capable yet appearing incapable, the Dao prevails and human talent fades. When people and the Dao cannot both be manifest, if people love fame, they do not employ the Dao; if the Dao prevails over people, fame ceases. When the Dao recedes and human fame flourishes, danger and ruin follow.\n\nLaozi said: To have trustworthy men distribute wealth is not as good as determining shares by drawing lots. Why? Those with intention cannot be as impartial as those without. To have incorruptible men guard wealth is not as good as sealing it behind closed doors. For those with desire cannot be as incorruptible as those without. If people point out one’s flaws, one resents it; if a mirror reveals one’s ugliness, one improves. One who can engage with things without entangling the self avoids encumbrance.\n\nLaozi said: In all dealings with others, if not with treasures and gifts, one must use humble words. Gifts may be meager, but desires are insatiable; humble posture and flattering speech may not forge lasting bonds. Oaths and pledges are made, yet betrayal comes first. Therefore, the noble person does not adorn the outside with benevolence and righteousness but cultivates the Dao and virtue within. They attend to affairs within their domain, exhaust the breadth of their land, encourage the people to hold fast to death, fortify their walls, and unite above and below in defending the altars of soil and grain. Thus, those who act for fame do not attack; those who act for profit without guilt do not invade. This is the Way of certain preservation and the principle of assured benefit.\n\nLaozi said: The sage does not overcome the heart; the multitude does not overcome desire. The noble person acts with upright qi; the petty person acts with perverse qi. Internally, it accords with one’s nature; externally, it conforms to righteousness. Moving in accordance with principle, not bound to things—this is upright qi. Indulging in flavors, lusting after sounds and colors, giving rein to joy and anger without regard for consequences—this is perverse qi. The perverse and the upright harm each other; desire and nature harm each other. They cannot coexist; one rises as the other falls. Thus, the sage reduces desire to follow nature. The eye delights in beauty, the ear in sound, the nose in fragrance, the mouth in taste—when these senses are gratified together, they do not depart from considerations of benefit and harm, which are the objects of desire. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth do not know what they desire; it is the heart that governs them, each obtaining its proper place. From this, it is clear that desire cannot prevail.\n\nLaozi said: In cultivating the self and nourishing one’s nature, one regulates rest and activity, harmonizes food and drink, and moderates joy and anger, so that what is within the self is attained and perverse qi has no way to enter. Adorning the outside harms the inside; indulging the emotions harms the spirit. What is seen as refinement obscures the truth. Those who for a moment do not forget their worthiness will surely exhaust their nature; those who within a hundred paces do not forget their appearance will surely burden their form. Thus, beautiful plumage harms the bones; lush branches and leaves harm the roots. To excel in both is impossible under Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven has its brightness and does not worry that the people are benighted; Earth has its wealth and does not worry that the people are poor. The highest virtue and the Dao are like a towering mountain, steadfast and unmoving. Travelers take them as their guide, straight and sufficient for all things. They do not bestow gifts upon people, nor do those who use them receive their virtue. Thus, abiding in peace, they endure long. Heaven and Earth do not interfere, thus they do not seize; they have no virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, there is no resentment. Those who are skilled in anger will surely incur much resentment; those who are skilled in giving will surely be skilled in seizing. Only by following the natural course of Heaven and Earth can one prevail over principle. Therefore, when praise appears, slander follows; when goodness appears, evil accompanies it. Profit becomes harm at its inception; fortune becomes misfortune at its outset. If one does not seek profit, there will be no harm; if one does not seek fortune, there will be no misfortune. The body takes preservation as its constant; wealth and honor are but temporary lodgings.\n\nLaozi said: The sage wears no eccentric garments nor performs strange deeds. His attire is unadorned, his conduct unostentatious, unobstructed yet not florid, impoverished yet not cowed, honored yet not conspicuous, humbled yet not disgraced, different yet not bizarre. In their shared use, there is nothing by which to name them—this is called the Great Pervasion.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao is straight and awaits the arrival of its time; it cannot be welcomed by turning back. When its time departs, it cannot be grasped by clinging. Thus, the sage does not advance to seek nor retreat to yield, but follows the times. When the three seasons pass, I run after them; when the three seasons come, I follow behind. Without departing or approaching, I stand centered in my place. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality; it only accompanies virtue. Fortune arrives not by one’s own seeking, thus one does not boast of merit; misfortune comes not from one’s own doing, thus one does not regret one’s conduct. The heart is tranquil and unburdened by virtue. Though dogs bark, one is not startled, trusting in one’s true nature. With sincerity and no transgression of one’s lot, the one who embodies the Dao is not deluded; the one who knows fate is not anxious. When emperors and kings perish, their bones are buried in the wild, yet their sacrifices are conducted in the Bright Hall—this is because the spirit is prized over the form. Thus, when the spirit governs the form, the form obeys; when the form overpowers the spirit, it is exhausted. Though intelligence and acuity are employed, they must return to the spirit—this is called the Great Pervasion.\n\nLaozi said: The ancients who preserved themselves delighted in virtue and forgot lowliness, thus their names remained unmoved. They delighted in the Dao and forgot poverty, thus their hearts remained unmoved by profit. Therefore, they were humble yet able to rejoice, tranquil yet able to be content. To calculate one’s lifespan while worrying over the world’s chaos is like weeping to replenish a drying river. Thus, one who does not worry over the world’s chaos but delights in its order may be spoken to of the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: People have three resentments—those with high rank are envied, those with great office are despised by their lord, and those with ample emolument are resented. Thus, the higher the rank, the more one should lower one’s intentions; the greater the office, the smaller one’s heart should be; the thicker the emolument, the more one should extend one’s beneficence. Cultivating these three ensures resentment does not arise. Therefore, nobility takes lowliness as its root, and height takes lowness as its foundation.\n\nLaozi said: Speech is the means by which one communicates oneself to others; hearing is the means by which others communicate to oneself. Being both blind and deaf, the Way of Man is obstructed. Those afflicted with blindness and deafness do not know how to manage affairs—how could it be only the body that suffers from blindness and deafness? The heart, too, has its obstructions, unaware of what it should connect with—this is the malady of blindness and deafness. The Dao is the ancestor of all things: all that has form is born from it, and its kinship is intimate. Those who consume grain and breathe qi all attain longevity—its lordship is generous. All the wise study it—its teaching is luminous. Yet people harm what is useful with what is useless. Thus, knowledge is not broad, and days are insufficient. The days spent on games like *bo* and *yi* could be used to inquire into the Dao. Not hearing and not asking are like blindness and deafness compared to others.\n\nLaozi said: In human nature, the heart submits to virtue, not to force. Virtue lies in giving, not in seeking. Thus, the sage who wishes to be valued by others first values others; who wishes to be honored by others first honors others; who wishes to prevail over others first prevails over himself; who wishes to humble others first humbles himself. Thus, nobility and lowliness, honor and humility are regulated by the Dao. The ancient sage-kings humbled their words before others and placed themselves behind others—then the world joyfully pushed them forward without tiring, bore them without feeling burdened. This is because their virtue was weighty and overflowing, and their qi was harmonious. Thus, to know that giving is taking and that putting others first is putting oneself first is to guard the Dao.\n\nLaozi said: Those with little virtue but much favor invite ridicule; those with meager talent but high position court danger; those with no great merit but ample emolument invite calamity. Thus, some things gain by being diminished, while others lose by being augmented. The multitude knows the benefit of benefit but not the harm of harm. Only the sage knows that harm is benefit and benefit is harm. Thus, a tree that bears fruit repeatedly will surely damage its roots; a household that hoards excessively will surely bring misfortune upon its descendants. The greatest profit turns into harm—this is the Way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: The petty man engages in affairs saying, \"Let me gain by any means\"; the noble man says, \"Let me act righteously.\" The good do not seek fame, yet fame follows them. Fame does not arrange to meet with profit, yet profit accrues to it. What they seek is the same, but what they reach differs. Thus, when action brings benefit, harm follows; when words lack constancy and conduct lacks consistency, this is the petty man. One who is discerning in one matter and proficient in one skill is a mediocre person. One who encompasses all and possesses both skill and talent is a sage.\n\nLaozi said: Life is what we borrow; death is what we return to. Thus, in an orderly age, one defends oneself with righteousness; in a chaotic age, one defends righteousness with oneself. The day of death is the end of one’s conduct. Therefore, the noble man is cautious in his single use of it. Life is received from Heaven; fate is encountered in the times. To have the talent but not meet the age is Heaven’s doing. To seek it by proper means is to obtain it by fate. The noble man can do good but cannot ensure he will receive fortune; he refrains from doing wrong yet cannot guarantee he will avoid misfortune. Thus, when the noble man encounters the times, he advances and obtains it with righteousness—what good fortune! When the times do not favor him, he retreats and yields with propriety—what misfortune! Therefore, though he dwells in poverty and lowliness, he has no regrets, for he has attained what he values.\n\nLaozi said: People have qi of compliance and rebellion born from the heart. When the heart is ordered, qi is compliant; when the heart is disordered, qi is rebellious. The order or disorder of the heart lies in moral virtue. Attaining the Dao, the heart is ordered; losing the Dao, the heart is disordered. When the heart is ordered, interactions are yielding; when the heart is disordered, interactions are contentious. Yielding brings virtue; contention breeds harm. With virtue, qi is compliant; with harm, qi is rebellious. Compliant qi diminishes oneself to serve others; rebellious qi diminishes others to serve oneself. These two qi can be guided and controlled by the self. The Way of Heaven is like an echo responding to a sound: virtue accumulates and fortune is born; misfortune accumulates and resentment arises. Officials fail in office; filial piety wanes with wives and children; suffering arises from worry; illness worsens when near recovery. Thus, being as cautious at the end as at the beginning ensures no failure in affairs.\n\nLaozi said: What if one promotes the crooked alongside the straight? One should not promote the straight alongside the crooked—do not proceed with such a course. This is what is meant by \"sharing the same filth yet differing in mud.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage equates life and death; the foolish also equate life and death. The sage equates life and death because he understands their inherent principles; the foolish equate life and death because they do not know where benefit and harm lie. The Dao hangs in the sky, things spread across the earth, and harmony resides in people. If the ruler of men is not harmonious, Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not rise, yin and yang are not regulated, wind and rain are untimely, and the people suffer illness and famine.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: To gain the troops of ten thousand men is not as good as hearing a single apt word. To obtain the Pearl of Marquis Sui is not as good as grasping the origins of affairs. To acquire the Jade of He the Duke is not as good as knowing the proper course of action. Though the world be vast, those fond of using troops will perish their states; though secure, those fond of war will endanger themselves. Thus, in a small state with few people, though there be tools of ten or a hundred times the utility, they are not to be used.\n\nLaozi said: Those who can become hegemons or kings must be those who prevail. Those who can prevail over enemies must be those who are strong. Those who can be strong must be those who employ human effort. Those who can employ human effort must be those who win the hearts of the people. Those who can win the hearts of the people must be those who have attained self-mastery. Those who have attained self-mastery must be those who are supple and weak. To be able to prevail over those inferior to oneself, when it comes to those equal to oneself, one must contend with suppleness. To prevail over those superior to oneself is a matter beyond calculation. Thus, those who can unite the many who cannot prevail achieve great victory.\n\n*Dao and Virtue*\n\nWenzi asked about the Dao. Laozi said: When learning is not precise and listening to the Dao is not deep, all who listen do so to attain wisdom, to perfect conduct, and to achieve merit and fame. If not precise, one will not be enlightened; if not deep, one will not be penetrating. Thus, in superior learning, one listens with the spirit; in middling learning, one listens with the heart; in inferior learning, one listens with the ears. To listen with the ears is to have learning in the skin; to listen with the heart is to have learning in the flesh; to listen with the spirit is to have learning in the marrow. Thus, if listening is not deep, knowledge will not be clear; if knowledge is not clear, one cannot exhaust its essence; if one cannot exhaust its essence, conduct will not be perfected. In all listening, the principle is to empty the heart, calm the self, diminish qi, be without excess, without thought, without anxiety, the eyes without reckless seeing, the ears without careless hearing. Concentrate the essence, accumulate and store it within; when the intent is full and complete, having attained it, one must firmly guard it and maintain it for long.\n\nThe Dao is the origin and source, having a beginning. It begins in suppleness and weakness, is completed in hardness and strength. It begins in brevity and fewness, is completed in multitude and length. A tree of ten spans begins with a handful; a terrace of a hundred fathoms begins from below. This is the Dao of Heaven. The sage models himself upon it: humility is how one places oneself below; withdrawal is how one puts oneself behind; frugality is how one makes oneself small; diminution is how one makes oneself few. Humility leads to honor, withdrawal leads to precedence, frugality leads to abundance, diminution leads to greatness. This is what the Dao of Heaven accomplishes.\n\nThe Dao is the origin of virtue, the root of Heaven, the gate of fortune, the source upon which the myriad things depend for birth, for completion, for repose. The Dao is non-action, without form; internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it governs others. When its work is accomplished and its affairs are established, it neighbors Heaven. Non-acting, yet nothing is left undone. None know its true nature, none know its reality, yet within it there is sincerity. When the Son of Heaven possesses the Dao, the world submits; he long preserves the altars of soil and grain. When the feudal lords possess the Dao, the people are harmonious and peaceful; they do not lose their states. When the scholar-commoners possess the Dao, they preserve their persons and protect their kin. When the strong and great possess the Dao, they conquer without fighting. When the small and weak possess the Dao, they obtain without contending. When affairs are conducted with the Dao, merit is achieved and fortune is obtained. When ruler and minister possess the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness. When father and son possess the Dao, there is compassion and filial piety. When scholar-commoners possess the Dao, there is mutual love. Thus, with the Dao there is harmony; without the Dao there is harshness. From this, it is observed that the Dao is fitting for all people in all circumstances.\n\nThe Dao, when practiced in small matters, brings small fortune; when practiced in great matters, brings great fortune; when practiced to the utmost, the world submits. When the world submits, it is embraced. Thus, the emperor is the one to whom the world turns; the king is the one to whom the world goes. If the world does not turn to him nor go to him, he cannot be called emperor or king. Thus, the emperor and king who do not win the people cannot succeed; those who win the people but lose the Dao cannot maintain their position. Those who lose the Dao are extravagant, arrogant, indolent, and idle; they are haughty, self-important, self-displaying, and self-promoting; they hold to strength and hardness, create difficulties, accumulate grudges, initiate conflicts, and become the heads of disorder. When petty men practice this, they themselves receive great calamity; when great men practice this, their states are destroyed. The calamity reaches them lightly, their descendants deeply. There is no greater crime than being without the Dao; there is no deeper resentment than being without virtue. This is the way of Heaven.\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice the Dao, though others be brave, cannot pierce them; though others be skillful, cannot strike them. Though they cannot be pierced or struck, and yet are still humiliated, it is not as good as making others, though brave, dare not pierce them, though skillful, dare not strike them. That they dare not is not because they lack the intent; it is not as good as making others lack the intent. That they lack the intent is because they have no thought of love or benefit; it is not as good as making all men and women under Heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit them. If this is so, there is no land where one is not lord, no office where one is not leader; under Heaven, none do not wish for their peace and benefit. Thus, those brave in daring will be killed; those brave in not daring will live.\n\nWenzi asked about virtue. Laozi said: To nurture, to nourish, to foster, to grow, to benefit all without discrimination, to unite with Heaven and Earth—this is called virtue. What is benevolence? To be above without boasting of one’s merit, to be below without shame for one’s faults; in great matters not to be arrogant, in small matters not to be negligent; to love universally without partiality, enduring without decline—this is called benevolence. What is righteousness? To be above is to assist the weak; to be below is to maintain integrity; when prosperous, not to indulge one’s desires; when poor, not to change one’s principles; to measure by the standard, follow the principle, not be partial or crooked—this is called righteousness. What is propriety? To be above is to be reverent and solemn; to be below is to be humble and respectful; to withdraw and yield, to be the female of the world, to stand in not daring, to establish in not being able—this is called propriety.\n\nThus, cultivating virtue, those below follow commands; cultivating benevolence, those below do not contend; cultivating righteousness, those below are level and upright; cultivating propriety, those below are respectful. When these four are cultivated, the state is peaceful and secure. Thus, that things are born is the Dao; that they grow is virtue; that they are loved is benevolence; that they are upright is righteousness; that they are respected is propriety. Without nurturing and nourishing, they cannot be fostered and grown; without compassion and love, they cannot be completed; without uprightness and correction, they cannot endure; without respect and honor, they cannot be valued. Thus, virtue is what the people value; benevolence is what the people cherish; righteousness is what the people fear; propriety is what the people respect. These four are the proper sequence of culture, by which the sage governs the myriad things.\n\nThe gentleman who lacks virtue will be resented by those below; who lacks benevolence will be contended against by those below; who lacks righteousness will be oppressed by those below; who lacks propriety will be thrown into chaos by those below. When these four constants are not established, it is called being without the Dao. There has never been one without the Dao who did not perish.\n\nLaozi said: In the age of utmost virtue, merchants find their markets convenient, farmers delight in their fields, great officers are secure in their positions, recluses cultivate their Dao, and the people enjoy their occupations. Thus, wind and rain do not break or snap grass and trees; none die prematurely; the Yellow River brings forth its diagram, the Luo River brings forth its writings. When the age declines, taxes and levies are without measure, killing and execution are without end; those who remonstrate are put to death, worthy scholars are suppressed. Thus, mountains collapse, rivers dry up, creeping things do not rest, and the wilds lack a hundred vegetables. Therefore, when the world is well-governed, even the foolish cannot alone cause disorder; when the world is in chaos, even the worthy cannot alone bring order. The sage is harmonious, joyful, and tranquil in life. When utmost virtue and the Dao prevail, it is fate. Thus, life encounters fate and then can act; fate meets the time and then can be enlightened. There must be the right age and then there can be the right person.",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi asked about sagacity and wisdom. Laozi said: \"To know by hearing is sagacity; to know by seeing is wisdom. Thus, the sage constantly perceives where fortune and misfortune arise and chooses the Way accordingly. The wise constantly see fortune and misfortune take shape and choose their conduct accordingly. The sage knows the auspicious and inauspicious in the heavenly Dao, thus knows where fortune and misfortune arise. The wise see their forms beforehand, thus know the gateway to fortune and misfortune. To hear before they arise is sagacity; to see before they take shape is wisdom. Those without hearing or seeing are foolish and deluded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"When a ruler favors righteousness, he trusts the times and relies on himself, discarding calculations and employing the foolish. With broad knowledge and shallow wisdom, to broadly provide with shallowness has never been possible. Relying solely on one’s own wisdom, failures must be many. Favoring wisdom is the path to exhausted strategies; favoring courage is the path to peril and ruin. Favoring bestowal leads to no fixed share; when the ruler’s share is not fixed, the people’s expectations know no end. If he heavily levies, he makes enemies of the people; if he takes little but gives much, his resources will have no limit. Thus, favoring bestowal is the path to inviting resentment. From this, we observe that wealth is insufficient to employ the Dao and arts; one must rely on clarity.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How did the kings of antiquity govern the world with the Dao?\" Laozi said: \"They grasped the One and practiced non-action, following the transformations of Heaven and Earth. The world is a great vessel; it cannot be grasped or acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Those who grasp see only the small; seeing only the small, they cannot accomplish the great. Non-action means maintaining stillness. By maintaining stillness, one can rectify the world. Abiding in great fullness without overflowing, dwelling in high nobility without arrogance—abiding in greatness without overflowing, full without deficiency; dwelling above without arrogance, high without peril; full without deficiency, thus long preserving wealth; high without peril, thus long preserving nobility. Wealth and nobility do not leave one’s person, and blessings extend to descendants. The kingly way of antiquity was complete in this.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The people have a Dao they all follow, laws they all uphold. Righteousness cannot firmly bind them, nor can might compel them. Thus, a ruler is established to unify them. When the ruler grasps the One, there is order; without constancy, there is chaos. The ruler’s Dao is not for acting but for non-acting. The wise do not make virtue their affair; the brave do not make force their violence; the benevolent do not make position their favor. This may be called the One. The One is the Dao without bias, the root of the myriad things. If the ruler frequently changes the laws, the state frequently changes rulers. People, through their positions, express their likes and dislikes; the tasks of subordinates are fearful and cannot be fully managed. Thus, when a ruler loses the One, the chaos is worse than having no ruler. The ruler must grasp the One and then can unite the many.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"Is there a safeguard for the kingly way?\" Laozi said: \"The One alone.\" Wenzi said: \"In antiquity, some ruled with the Dao, others with arms. How is this the One?\" Laozi said: \"Those who ruled with the Dao did so through virtue; those who ruled with arms also did so through virtue. In the use of arms, there are five types: righteous arms, responsive arms, resentful arms, greedy arms, and arrogant arms. Punishing the violent and saving the weak is called righteous; when an enemy attacks and one has no choice but to use arms, it is called responsive; contending over small matters, unable to conquer the heart, is called resentful; desiring others’ lands and coveting others’ wealth is called greedy; relying on the greatness of one’s state, priding oneself on the multitude of one’s people, and wishing to be seen as worthy by enemy states is called arrogant. Righteous arms bring kingship; responsive arms bring victory; resentful arms bring defeat; greedy arms bring death; arrogant arms bring destruction. This is the heavenly Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Abandoning the Dao and relying on wisdom leads to peril; discarding calculations and employing talent leads to困. Thus, maintaining one’s place and following principle, one does not grieve over losses nor rejoice over gains. Success is not what one acts for; gain is not what one seeks. Incoming, there is receiving but no taking; outgoing, there is bestowal but no giving. Following spring to give life, following autumn to kill—what is given life owes no gratitude; what is killed bears no resentment. Thus, one is safeguarded by the Dao.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"How does a ruler gain the people’s joyful hearts?\" Laozi said: \"Be like the rivers and seas—bland and without flavor, inexhaustible in use. Put the small before the great. Those who wish to rise above others must first place their words below them; those who wish to precede others must first place themselves behind. To win the world, one must emulate its joy and love, advance its benevolence and righteousness without harshness. Dwelling above, the people do not find one burdensome; standing in front, the multitude is not harmed. The world joyfully pushes one forward without weariness. Though distant lands and different customs, even the flying insects and creeping things, none are not loving and intimate. Without going, there is nowhere unreached; without journeying, there is nowhere not arrived. Thus, one is honored by the world.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Holding to the world’s laws and registers to oppose transmitted customs is like gluing the pegs when tuning a zither. The sage responds to the times with flexible changes, seeing forms and applying what is fitting. As ages differ, affairs change; as times shift, customs transform. Discussing the age, establishing laws, acting according to the times—kings of high antiquity had different laws and standards, not because antiquity and the present are opposed, but because their tasks and duties differed. Thus, one does not model after already established laws but models after that by which laws are made, moving with transformations. The sage’s laws can be observed, but the reasons for their creation cannot be traced; his words can be heard, but the reasons for his speech cannot be discerned. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors held the world lightly, considered the myriad things as insignificant, equated death and life, and harmonized with changes. Embracing the Dao and extending sincerity, they mirrored the feelings of the myriad things. Above, they befriended the Dao; below, they befriended transformation. Now, if one wishes to learn their Dao but does not attain their clarity and mysterious sagacity, holding to their laws and registers and enacting their statutes and decrees, one certainly cannot govern.\"\n\nWenzi asked about governance. Laozi said: \"Guide them with the Dao, nourish them with virtue. Do not display worthiness, do not apply force. Diminish and grasp the One. Have no place to profit, no desires to be seen. Be square without cutting, sharp without wounding. Be without pride, without boasting. Guide them with the Dao, and the people will attach; nourish them with virtue, and the people will submit. Do not display worthiness, and the people will be content; do not apply force, and the people will be simple. Not displaying worthiness is frugality; not applying force is humility. Below, gather them; with bribes, take from them. Be frugal to preserve oneself; be humble to secure oneself. Without gathering below, they scatter; without nourishing, they turn away. Displaying worthiness leads to contention; applying force leads to resentment. Scattering weakens the state’s power; turning away means the ruler loses authority. Contention leads to轻易 wrongdoing; resentment of superiors endangers position. If these four are truly cultivated, the correct Dao is safeguarded.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Words from above are used below; words from below are used above. Words from above are constantly used; words from below are flexibly used. Only the sage can know flexible words and yet be certain, meet expectations and yet be appropriate. In the world, the highest conduct is to be upright and prove the father trustworthy, to be faithful and die for the woman. Who can value this? Thus, the sage discusses the right and wrong of affairs, bending and extending with them, without constant standards. When the ruler is upright, he is the named lord; when he is indulgent, he is seized by his father. Circumstances compel this. Flexibility is how the sage uniquely perceives what goes against first and then accords. What accords first and then goes against does not know flexibility. Not knowing flexibility, good reverses to ugliness.\"",

      "translated_text": "Wenzi asked, \"Master, in your teaching, none but the Dao and virtue can govern the world. Yet among the kings of high antiquity who inherited their legacy, some were without the Dao, yet passed their years without calamity or ruin—by what Dao was this so?\"\n\nLaozi replied, \"From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, each sustains their own life, yet the fullness of that life varies in thickness and thinness. The world at times sees states perish and houses break apart, not for lack of the Dao and virtue. Where the Dao and virtue are present, one rises early and retires late without slackening, trembling and vigilant, ever fearing peril and ruin. Where the Dao and virtue are absent, desires run rampant and indolence sets in—ruin comes without warning. If Jie and Zhou had followed the Dao and practiced virtue, even the worthy Tang and Wu would have had no merit to establish. The Dao and virtue are that by which all things nurture and sustain one another, rear and foster one another, cherish and love one another, respect and honor one another.\n\nEven the deaf worm, though dull, does not harm what it loves. If truly the people of the world all harbored hearts of benevolence and love, from where would calamity and disaster arise? Those without the Dao yet free from harm—benevolence has not yet vanished, and righteousness has not yet perished. Though benevolence has not vanished and righteousness has not perished, if the feudal lords slight their superiors, the court will not be reverent. Even if they do not yet rebel, when benevolence is extinguished and righteousness is lost, the feudal lords will turn against one another, the strong will oppress the weak, the great will encroach upon the small, and the people will make attack and assault their trade. Disasters will arise, chaos will erupt—ruin will come without delay. How could one expect to escape harm?\n\nLaozi said, \"When laws are excessive and punishments severe, the people give birth to deceit. When the ruler is meddlesome, the subjects multiply their guises. The more one seeks, the less one obtains; the more one prohibits, the less one prevails. To generate affairs from affairs and then use affairs to halt affairs is like fanning a fire to prevent it from burning. To generate trouble from cleverness and then use cleverness to guard against it is like stirring water and seeking its clarity.\n\nLaozi said, \"If the ruler favors benevolence, he rewards those without merit and releases those with crimes. If he favors punishment, he dismisses those with merit and implicates the innocent. Without favor or aversion, he executes without resentment and bestows without claiming virtue—level as the plumb line, straight as the marking cord, his person uninvolved in affairs, like heaven, like earth. What does not cover and bear all is harmonious and unified—this is the lord. What distinguishes and executes is the law. When the people receive execution without resentment or regret, this is called the Dao and virtue.\n\nLaozi said, \"In the world, right and wrong have no fixed standard. Each age affirms what it deems good and rejects what it deems bad. Those who seek what is right do not seek the principle of the Dao but seek what accords with themselves. They do not reject what is perverse but reject what opposes their hearts. Now, if I wished to choose what is right and dwell in it, choose what is wrong and cast it aside, I would not know the world’s so-called right and wrong. Thus, governing a great state is like cooking a small fish—do not stir it. Those who rush to accord speak words that hit the mark and gain intimacy, yet if their persons are distant and their plans apt, they are met with suspicion. Now, if I wished to rectify myself and await things, how would I know what the world follows to gauge me? If I were to hasten along with the俗, it would be like fleeing the rain—there is nowhere one does not get drenched. If one’s desire lies in emptiness, one cannot be empty. But that which does not strive for emptiness and is empty of itself—this is what one desires, and nothing fails to come to it.\n\nThus, one who is penetrating in the Dao is like the axle of a cart: it does not move itself yet, with the hub, reaches a thousand *li*, turning on the boundless plain. Therefore, the sage embodies the Dao, returning to the ultimate, unchanging to await change, moving yet without action.\n\nLaozi said, \"Those who frequently wage war and repeatedly triumph will surely see their state perish. Frequent war exhausts the people; repeated triumph makes the ruler arrogant. To employ an arrogant ruler to command an exhausted people and not have the state perish is rare indeed. When the ruler is arrogant, he indulges himself; when he indulges, he reaches excess. When the people are exhausted, they resent; when they resent, they reach the limit of their thoughts. When both above and below reach their limits, and the state does not perish—this has never been. Thus, success achieved, the body retreats—this is the Dao of heaven.\"\n\nKing Ping asked Wenzi, \"I have heard that you received the Dao from Lao Dan. Now, though worthy men possess the Dao, they encounter an age of excess and disorder. With the authority of one man, how can they transform a people long steeped in chaos?\"\n\nWenzi replied, \"The Dao and virtue rectify the perverse to make them upright, rouse the disordered to make them well-ordered, transform excess and decay to restore simplicity. When pure virtue revives, the world is at peace—this hinges on one man. The ruler is the people’s teacher. What is above serves as the model for what is below. If what is above is refined, what is below emulates it. If what is above possesses the Dao and virtue, what is below possesses benevolence and righteousness. When what is below possesses benevolence and righteousness, there will be no age of excess and disorder.\n\nAccumulated virtue completes kingship; accumulated resentment completes ruin. Accumulated stones form mountains; accumulated waters form seas. Without accumulation, nothing comes to completion. Those who accumulate the Dao and virtue—heaven grants them aid, earth assists them, gods and spirits support them. The phoenix soars in their courtyards; the qilin roams their outskirts; the jiao-dragon lodges in their ponds. Thus, to govern the world with the Dao is the world’s virtue. To govern the world without the Dao is the world’s bane. To make an enemy of the world with one man—though one might wish for longevity, it cannot be attained.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yao and Shun flourished by this; Jie and Zhou perished by this. King Ping said, \"I reverently heed your command.\"\n\n**On Supreme Virtue**\nLaozi said: The ruler is the heart of the state. When the heart is ordered, the hundred limbs are all at peace; when the heart is disturbed, the hundred limbs are all in chaos. Thus, when one’s person is ordered, the limbs and body forget one another; when the state is ordered, ruler and ministers forget one another.\n\nLaozi said: Learning from Chang Cong, one sees the tongue endure while teeth decay and thus guards softness. Gazing at the eaves, one retreats and follows the river to observe reflections, thereby knowing to hold back. Thus, the sage embraces emptiness and non-action, follows the constant, holds back rather than advances—like piling firewood, the last placed is on top. **[Chang Cong was Laozi’s teacher.]**\n\nLaozi said: The ringing bell destroys itself with sound; the tallow candle consumes itself with light. The tiger and leopard are hunted for their patterns; the gibbon and monkey are trapped for their agility. Thus, the valiant and martial perish by their strength; the eloquent and clever are ensnared by their wit. Those who rely on partial knowledge are perceptive in one matter but blind in another; those who claim omniscience through knowledge do not know what lies beyond knowledge. Thus, one may be bold in a single skill and discerning in a single phrase—sufficient for subtle persuasion, but not for broad response.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao takes non-being as its essence. Gazing at it, one sees no form; listening to it, one hears no sound. It is called \"profound and obscure\"—these terms describe the Dao but are not the Dao itself. The Dao lies in inward reflection and self-examination. Thus, one does not become slightly deluded or greatly confused, nor slightly wise or greatly foolish. Nothing reflects more clearly than still water, for it preserves inner stillness and does not drift outward. The moon’s light is eclipsed by the sun; shadows cannot contend with radiance. The branch cannot surpass the trunk, nor the twig the branch. When the top is heavy and the bottom light, overturning is inevitable. A single abyss does not harbor two jiao-dragons; a single female does not mate with two males. When one is settled, two contend. Jade lies in the mountain, and the grass and trees are moistened; pearls form in the deep, and the banks do not wither. The earthworm, though lacking strong sinews or sharp claws, eats dust above and drinks from the yellow springs below—all by focusing its mind singularly.\n\nClarity brings illumination: a cup of water reveals the pupil. Turbidity brings harm: the Yellow River cannot reflect Mount Tai. Orchids and angelicas do not lose their fragrance for lack of wear; boats do not sink in rivers and seas for lack of passengers. The noble person practices the Dao not for want of recognition but because it is the nature of his being.\n\nEntering the turbid from clarity brings distress and disgrace; entering the clear from turbidity brings ruin and collapse. When heaven’s two qi converge, a rainbow forms; when earth’s two qi converge, springs erupt; when a person’s two qi converge, illness arises. Yin and yang cannot remain constant—now winter, now summer; the moon knows not day, the sun knows not night. Where rivers are wide, fish grow large; where mountains are high, trees grow tall; where the land is vast, virtue is profound. Thus, fish cannot be caught without bait, nor beasts summoned with empty vessels. Where mountains harbor fierce beasts, the forest remains uncut; where gardens shelter stinging insects, the mallows and beans remain unpicked. A state with worthy ministers repels invasions a thousand *li* away. Those who accord with the Dao are like an axle turning within the hub—unchanged by itself, yet conveying one a thousand *li*, ever returning to the beginning, revolving in the boundless source.\n\nThus, what is gained by elevating the crooked alongside the straight? Better to elevate the straight alone and not the crooked. Once, a bird was about to arrive, and a net was spread to await it. The bird was caught by a single mesh of the net. Now, if one were to make a net of a single mesh, there would be no time one could catch a bird. Thus, some matters cannot be prearranged, and some things cannot be foreseen. Therefore, the sage accumulates the Dao and awaits the moment.\n\nTo catch fish, first clear the valley; to seek birds, first raise the trees. Water gathers, and fish assemble; trees flourish, and birds gather. Those who obtain fish do not drag them into the deep; those who obtain monkeys do not carry them up the trees. Release them where they find advantage, and their needs are met. What they tread is shallow, yet they await what they do not tread before they can walk. What the mind knows is limited, yet it awaits what it does not know before it can attain clarity. When rivers run dry, valleys empty; when hills are leveled, abysses fill. When lips are gone, teeth grow cold. When river waters run deep, soil remains on the mountains. When water is still, it is clear; when clear, it is level; when level, it is smooth; when smooth, it reflects the forms of things. Forms cannot coexist, and thus can serve as standards. Leaves fall when the wind shakes them; water grows turbid when things disturb it. The roundness of a jade disk is the work of the grinding wheel; the sharpness of a blade is the work of the whetstone.",

      "translated_text": "The blind may lack eyes, yet their ears cannot be obscured—so keen is their hearing. Can the turbid, swirling waters cleanse my feet? Can the clear, rippling stream wash my cap strings? The mulberry bark that becomes fine silk may be woven into a crown or a mourning cap—worn on the head or trampled underfoot. The strength of metal prevails over wood: a single blade cannot fell a forest. The force of earth prevails over water: a handful of soil cannot dam a river. The might of water prevails over fire: a ladleful cannot quench a cartload of burning kindling. Winter brings thunder, summer brings hail, yet cold and heat do not alter their seasons. Frost and snow vanish at sunrise, melting away—easily overturned, easily toppled, easily aided, easily drenched. Orchids and angelica, though fragrant, cannot withstand the frost; toads ward off weapons, and their longevity peaks at the full moon of the fifth month. Those who dissipate their essence perish early; blossoms that bloom out of season cannot be eaten. Between the tongue and the teeth, which decays first? Between the plumb line and the arrow, which is straighter?\n\nIt is form that bends the shadow, sound that muddies the echo. One afflicted by the same illness as the dead cannot be a skilled physician; one who follows the path of a fallen state cannot devise loyal strategies. Let a musician play the *yu* or an artisan shape its holes—though they strike the notes perfectly, they cannot be entrusted with judging the ruler’s appearance. The deaf do not sing, for they have no joy in it; the blind do not gaze, for they cannot engage with the world. Walking through a forest, one cannot take the straight path; traversing perilous terrain, one cannot tread the plumb line.\n\nWithin the seas, all things arise, and thus the great can be vast. The sun does not rise twice; the fox does not have two alphas; the divine dragon does not pair; the fierce beast does not herd; the raptor does not mate. Without rafters, the sun’s wheel cannot be shaded; without spokes, it cannot race swiftly—yet rafters and spokes alone are not to be relied upon. Draw the bow and shoot: without the bowstring, the arrow cannot be loosed. The act of shooting is but one-tenth of the arrow’s flight. A starving horse in the stable makes no sound, but toss fodder beside it, and its competitive spirit arises.\n\nA three-inch tube, though bottomless, cannot fill the world, yet stop it with a plug, and it holds a hundred *dou*. Follow the plumb line to cut, and you will not err; hang the balance to measure, and you will not miss. Suspend the ancient methods to assess, and though they may sometimes succeed, the staff and cangue are applied at their proper times. To act in accordance with principle is called judgment; to act contrary to it is called chaos.\n\nThe farmer toils while the gentleman is nourished; the fool speaks while the wise choose. What is seen clearly is handled like jade and stone; what is dimly perceived must be pondered. A hundred stars’ brightness does not equal the light of a single moon; ten windows thrown open do not match the illumination of one door. The viper cannot serve as feet; the tiger cannot serve as wings.\n\nNow, a six-foot mat: the mediocre may lie upon it and stretch beyond its bounds, while the exceptional may stand and surpass it—talent and circumstance differ in their application. Those who assist in sacrifices taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights suffer wounds. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites the thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon strive to shine, yet floating clouds obscure them. The river seeks clarity, yet silt muddies it. The orchid aspires to flourish, yet autumn winds ruin it. Human nature desires balance, yet desires harm it. Shield your eyes from dust, yet you cannot avoid specks; polish gold and carve tortoiseshell—only the worthy wear them as pendants. Earth and soil cover the land, yet only the capable find wealth in them.\n\nThus, to the weak, gold and jade are not as good as a foot of plain silk. A hollow hub stands at the center, and thirty spokes each exert their strength—if one axle alone were to enter, all the spokes would be cast aside. How could near or far be reached? The orange and pomelo have their native soil; reeds and rushes grow in clusters. Beasts with the same feet travel together; birds with the same wings soar together. To survey the Nine Provinces’ lands without journeying a thousand *li*, without grasping the roots of governance and instruction, and yet aspire to rule over the myriad people—this is difficult indeed.\n\nThe fierce are hunted; the cautious are shot. Thus, the purest white seems tainted; the greatest virtue seems insufficient. The gentleman has wine; the petty man lashes the jar. Though one may not admire it, it can still shame others. Human nature is such that plain cloth and silk, though shot through, become armor—what is inconvenient is cast aside to seize what is advantageous.\n\nThirty spokes share one hub, each fitting its own mortise without intrusion—just as ministers each guard their duties. One who uses people well is like the centipede’s many legs, numerous yet unobstructed, or like the tongue and teeth, hard and soft grinding without harming each other. Stone is born hard; angelica is born fragrant. The young may possess it, but the old grow ever wiser. Support and lifting, gratitude and yielding, gain and loss, promise and self—these differ by a thousand *li*. Those reborn do not bear blossoms; those who bloom too early wither before the frost. Defile your nose, powder your forehead; a rotting rat lies in the hall, yet you burn incense within. Enter water and hate to get wet; cling to stench yet seek fragrance—even the skilled cannot craft this.\n\nWinter ice can be shattered; summer wood can be knotted—timing is hard to grasp yet easy to lose. A tree in full vigor may be harvested all day, and it will regrow; but when autumn winds bring frost, it withers in a single night. The target is set, and arrows gather; the forest is lush, and axes enter—not by summons, but by the force of circumstance. The nursing pup bites the tiger; the crouching hen strikes the fox—favor is bestowed without measuring strength.\n\nThose who climb for profit will drown in it; those who drown for profit must be drowned by it. A boat can float or sink—fools do not know enough to stop. The swift steed may be driven forward but not urged on, pulled back but not halted. A ruler who does not seek the Dao is like this. Water, though level, must have waves; the balance, though true, must have discrepancies. A foot, though even, must have flaws. Without compass and square, one cannot determine circle and square; without plumb line and level, one cannot correct crooked and straight. Yet even those who use compass and square must have the heart of compass and square.\n\nMount Tai’s height may double, yet it cannot be seen; the tip of an autumn hair may be examined closely. Bamboo and wood contain fire, but without drilling, they will not smoke; earth holds water, but without digging, it will not emerge. An arrow’s speed does not exceed two *li*; half-steps, unceasing, carry the lame turtle a thousand *li*. Pile up earth without rest, and hills and mountains form. Standing by the river wishing for fish is not as good as returning to weave a net.\n\nFirst tune the bow, then seek strength; first tame the horse, then seek speed; first establish trust, then seek ability. The finest smith cannot melt wood; the skilled carpenter cannot carve ice. There are things beyond human power—the gentleman does not dwell on them. Make people cross the river, and the river may be made wave-free; but to make the river itself waveless is impossible. The saying goes: \"The innocent pot will not fall into the well.\"\n\nThose who criticize my conduct seek my friendship; those who disparage my goods seek to trade with me. One move in chess does not reveal wisdom; one pluck of the bowstring does not make a lament. Now, a burning coal: pick it up, and it scorches the fingers—so close is the harm. A hundredweight of incense burns together, yet step ten paces away, and its scent does not kill—same substance, different accumulation.\n\nA six-foot mat: lie upon it, and even the mediocre may overstep its bounds; stand upon it, and even the exceptional may not surpass it—circumstance and application differ. Those who assist in sacrifices taste the offerings; those who intervene in fights suffer wounds. Sheltering beneath an ill-omened tree invites the thunderbolt’s strike. The sun and moon strive to shine, yet floating clouds obscure them. The river seeks clarity, yet silt muddies it. The orchid aspires to flourish, yet autumn winds ruin it. Human nature desires balance, yet desires harm it. Shield your eyes from dust, yet you cannot avoid specks.\n\nPolish gold and carve tortoiseshell—only the worthy wear them as pendants.

Build upon height to make a mountain, and it stands firm without peril; delve into depth to make an abyss, and it grows profound, drawing fish and turtles to it.

      "translated_text": "Those who know glory must also know sorrow and weariness. Above are silks and fine fabrics; below must be coarse hemp and sackcloth. The greater the tree, the deeper its roots; the taller the mountain, the broader its base.\n\nLaozi said: The drum does not conceal sound, thus it can produce sound. The mirror does not obscure form, thus it can reflect form. Metal and stone possess sound, yet without movement, they do not ring. The flute and panpipes possess tone, yet without blowing, they remain silent. Therefore, the sage inwardly conceals and does not initiate; when affairs come, they govern them; when things arrive, they respond. The heavens move without cease, ending only to begin anew—thus they endure long. The wheel turns where it should, thus it travels far. The heavens move as one without deviation, thus they commit no error.\n\nHeaven’s qi descends; earth’s qi ascends. Yin and yang interact, and the myriad things are harmonized as one. The noble employ affairs, and the petty fade away—such is the Dao of heaven and earth. If heaven’s qi does not descend and earth’s qi does not ascend, if yin and yang do not communicate, the myriad things do not flourish. The petty gain power, the noble fade away, the five grains are not planted, and virtue is inwardly concealed—this is the Dao of heaven, which reduces excess to supplement deficiency; the Dao of earth, which lowers the high to raise the low; the Dao of spirits, which curbs arrogance to humble the exalted; and the Dao of man, where the abundant do not bestow. The sage’s Dao is lowly, and none can surpass it.\n\nThe heavens are bright, and only then can they illuminate the four directions. When the ruler is enlightened and the ministers are enlightened, the realm is at peace. When the realm possesses fourfold brightness, it can endure long. To make its bestowal clear is to make its transformation clear.\n\nThe Dao of heaven patterns; the Dao of earth orders. Harmony is made of oneness, and timing is made to serve—thus the myriad things are completed. This is called the Dao. The great Dao is smooth and unobstructed, not far from the self. Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true. Cultivate it in things, and its virtue does not cease. Heaven covers the myriad things, bestowing its virtue to nurture them, giving without taking—thus the spirit returns to it.\n\nTo give without taking is the highest virtue.

      "translated_text": "The marsh is the lowest of the low, just as heaven is the highest of the high. The sage models this: when honor and humility are ordered, the world is settled. Earth bears the myriad things and makes them grow, giving and taking—thus bones and skeletons return to it. To give and take is lesser virtue. Yet lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus it is without flaw. Earth receives heaven’s mandate and thereby establishes tranquility. When earth is tranquil, the myriad things take form. Earth is vast and thick, gathering the myriad things in settled tranquility. Nothing is not borne, nothing is not contained. Earth’s depth and thickness gather springs and waters. Earth’s Dao is square and broad, and thus it endures long. The sage models this: his virtue contains all. When yin yields to yang, the myriad things flourish; when yang returns to yin, the myriad things rest. When things flourish, nothing is not provided for; when things rest, nothing is not at peace. When things are at peace, nothing is not well-ordered.\n\nWhen yin harms things, yang naturally withdraws; when yin advances, yang retreats. When petty men gain power, noble men avoid harm—this is the way of heaven. When yang qi moves, the myriad things relax and find their place. Thus the sage follows the yang Dao. Those who follow things, things follow in turn; those who oppose things, things oppose in turn. Therefore, one does not lose the nature and disposition of things. When marshes and wetlands are full, the myriad things mature; when marshes and wetlands dry, the myriad things wither. Thus when rain and moisture do not flow, the world becomes barren. Yang rises and then returns below, becoming the master of the myriad things. It does not long abide above, and thus it can end and begin anew, enduring long. Because it endures long, it becomes the mother of the world. Yang qi accumulates and then can bestow; yin qi gathers and then can transform. There has never been one who could transform without first accumulating. Thus the sage is cautious in what he accumulates. When yang extinguishes yin, the myriad things grow plump; when yin extinguishes yang, the myriad things decline. Therefore, when kings and lords esteem the yang Dao, the myriad things flourish; when they esteem the yin Dao, the world perishes. If yang does not descend, yin cannot complete the myriad things; if the ruler does not descend to his ministers, virtuous transformation does not flow. Thus when the ruler descends to his ministers, wisdom and clarity prevail; when he does not descend, darkness and deafness ensue.\n\nThe sun emerges from the earth, and the myriad things flourish; kings and lords stand above the people, illuminating the Dao and its virtue. The sun enters the earth, and the myriad things rest; petty men stand above the people, and the myriad things flee and hide. When thunder moves, the myriad things awaken; when rain moistens, the myriad things are released. The great man’s bestowal of virtue is like this. The movement of yin and yang has constant measure; the great man’s movement does not exceed things. Thunder shakes the earth, and the myriad things relax; wind sways the trees, and grasses and trees wither. When the great man removes evil and pursues good, the people do not wander far. Thus the people have departures and arrivals: departing from great faults and arriving at minor improvements. When wind does not move, fire does not emerge; when the great man does not speak, petty men have nothing to recount. When fire emerges, it must await fuel; when the great man speaks, he must be trustworthy. With trustworthiness and truth, what endeavor does not succeed?\n\nRiver waters run deep, and soil gathers on mountains; hills and mounds rise and fall into the abyss. When yang qi flourishes, it transforms into yin; when yin qi flourishes, it transforms into yang. Thus desire must not be filled, joy must not be extreme. Do not let anger give rise to vicious words; do not let wrath produce harsh expressions. This is called calculated gain. Fire flames upward, water flows downward—the sage’s Dao seeks harmony between them. When the sage leans toward yang, the world is harmonious and united; when he leans toward yin, the world is drowned and submerged.\n\nLaozi said: “Accumulate thinness to become thick; accumulate lowness to become high.” The noble man daily strives to achieve brilliance; the petty man daily hastens toward disgrace. Their rise and fall, though not yet visible, are manifest: he who sees good as if he cannot reach it, and lodges evil as if it were inauspicious, even if he errs while moving toward good, will incur no resentment. But he who does not move toward good, even if loyal, will attract misfortune. Thus resenting others is not as good as resenting oneself; exhorting others is not as good as exhorting oneself. Voice is self-summoned; harmony is self-sought. Fame is self-declared; position is self-assigned. There is nothing that is not of the self. Wielding a sharp point to stab, grasping a blade to strike—why resent others? Thus the noble man is cautious in his defenses.\n\nThe myriad things carry yin on their backs and embrace yang, blending qi to achieve harmony. Harmony dwells in the center. Thus fruits of trees grow from the heart; seeds of grasses grow from their defenses. Eggs and wombs are born from the center. Those not born from eggs or wombs require time. When the land is level, water does not flow; when weight is balanced, the scale does not tilt. The generation and transformation of things arise from resonance.\n\nLaozi said: “When mountains reach their height, clouds and rain arise; when waters reach their depth, dragons are born. When the noble man attains his Dao, his virtue and beneficence flow forth.” Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown. Sowing millet will not yield sorghum; sowing resentment will bring no return of virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: The Dao may be weak, may be strong; may be yielding, may be firm; may be yin, may be yang; may be obscure, may be luminous. It can embrace heaven and earth, can respond to the boundless. What is known of it is shallow; what is unknown, profound. What is known lies without; what is unknown, within. What is known is coarse; what is unknown, refined. Knowing it, one does not know; not knowing, one knows it. Who knows that knowing is not-knowing, and not-knowing is knowing?\n\nThe Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Who knows the formless form?\n\nThus, when all under heaven know goodness as goodness, it is no longer good. The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise.\n\nWenzi asked: Can one speak subtly?\nLaozi said: Why not? Only those who know speech are meant.\nThose who know speech do not speak with words. Those who chase fish get wet; those who pursue beasts run—not for pleasure. Thus, the highest speech abandons speech; the highest action abandons action. What shallow minds contend over is trivial.\n\nSpeech has its source; affairs have their lord. To feign ignorance is why I am not understood.\n\nWenzi asked: Is there a method for governing a state?\nLaozi said: Now, those pulling a cart call out *xiehu* in front, and those behind respond—this is the song that encourages their strength. Though the music of Zheng, Wei, Hu, and Chu may be fine, it does not match the meaning of this. In governing a state, propriety lies in ritual, not in ornate debate. When laws and decrees proliferate, thieves and bandits abound.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao has no norm, yet it may serve as the norm. It is like forests and mountains, which may serve as timber, yet timber does not equal forests and mountains; forests and mountains do not equal clouds and rain; clouds and rain do not equal yin and yang; yin and yang do not equal harmony; harmony does not equal the Dao. The Dao is what is called the form of the formless, the image of the imageless. Those who grasp its meaning can shape and transform all between heaven and earth.\n\nLaozi said: When the sage establishes teachings and enacts governance, he must examine their beginning and end, see their origins and outcomes. Thus, when the people know writing, virtue declines; when they know calculation, benevolence declines; when they know contracts, trust declines; when they know machinery, substance declines.\n\nThe zither does not sound, yet its twenty-five strings each respond to their tones. The axle does not turn of itself, yet its thirty spokes each rotate with their force. Only when there is slack and tension can music be made; only when there is labor and rest can distant journeys be reached. Thus, what has sound is made by what is soundless; what turns is made by what does not turn.\n\nThe ways of high and low differ. When governance is easy, disorder arises. Those in high position with great Dao succeed in great matters; those with small Dao bring misfortune. Minor virtue harms righteousness; minor goodness harms the Dao; petty eloquence harms governance; harsh severity injures virtue. Great uprightness is not perilous, so the people are easily guided. Supreme governance is leisurely, so the people do not harm. Utmost loyalty returns to simplicity, so the people do not conceal or feign.\n\nLaozi said: When laws of mutual implication are established, the hundred clans resent them. When decrees to reduce ranks are enforced, meritorious ministers rebel. Thus, those skilled in the traces of brush and knife do not know the root of order and chaos; those practiced in battlefield formations do not know the authority of temple strategy. The sage first secures blessings within the inner passes and considers calamities beyond the unseen. The foolish are deluded by small gains and forget great harm. Thus, affairs may benefit the small but harm the great; gain here may mean loss there. Therefore, nothing is greater than loving others in benevolence, nothing greater than knowing others in wisdom. Loving others leaves no resentment; knowing others leaves no disordered governance.\n\nLaozi said: The great overflow of rivers and lakes does not last beyond three days. Whirlwinds and violent rains do not last from dawn to dusk. Those who do not accumulate virtue without worry will perish when their time comes. Worry brings prosperity; joy brings ruin. Thus, the good turn weakness into strength, misfortune into fortune. The Dao is empty yet inexhaustible in use.\n\nLaozi said: Tranquility and harmony are human nature. Rules and measures are the systems of affairs. Knowing human nature, one nurtures oneself without error. Knowing the systems of affairs, one’s actions are not disordered. Issuing a single command disperses without end; gathering a single thread is called the mind. Seeing the root, one knows the branches; grasping the one, one responds to the ten thousand—this is called *shu*. Knowing where to act, knowing where to go, knowing what to ride, knowing where to stop—this is called the Dao. Making others esteem and praise oneself is the power of the mind; making others belittle and slander oneself is the mind’s fault.\n\nWords spoken from the mouth cannot be forbidden by others; actions taken nearby cannot be forbidden from afar. Affairs are difficult to accomplish and easy to ruin; reputations are difficult to establish and easy to destroy. People all take small harms lightly and treat minor matters carelessly, leading to great calamity. When misfortune arrives, people bring it upon themselves; when fortune comes, people complete it themselves. Misfortune and fortune share the same door; benefit and harm dwell as neighbors. Without utmost clarity, none can distinguish them. Thus, wisdom and foresight are the doors and windows of fortune and misfortune; movement and stillness are the pivot and mechanism of benefit and harm. One cannot but examine them carefully.\n\nLaozi said: All know the mechanisms of order and chaos, yet none know the tools of preserving life. Thus, the sage discusses the world and acts accordingly, weighs affairs and plans accordingly. The sage can be yin, can be yang; can be yielding, can be firm; can be weak, can be strong. Following the times in movement and stillness, relying on resources to achieve success, observing things’ going and knowing their return, handling one affair and examining its changes—then one acts accordingly. Thus, one may practice this all one’s life without distress. Some affairs can be spoken but not done; some can be done but not spoken; some are easy to do but hard to complete; some are hard to complete but easy to ruin. What can be done but not spoken is taking and abandoning; what can be spoken but not done is deceit and falsehood; what is easy to do but hard to complete is affairs; what is hard to complete but easy to ruin is reputation. These four are what the sage attends to, what the enlightened alone perceive.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao respects the small and subtle, moves without losing the moment. In archery, one must be cautious; calamity will not then grow. Calculate blessings without reaching them; consider misfortunes beyond them. On the same day, those sheltered by frost are not harmed. The foolish, with preparation, share the same success as the wise. Accumulating love becomes fortune; accumulating hatred becomes misfortune. All know how to rescue calamity, but none know how to prevent calamity from arising. Preventing calamity is easier than rescuing it, yet people do not strive to prevent calamity but strive to rescue it. Even the divine cannot devise plans for this. The origins of calamity and misfortune are boundless. The sage dwells deeply to avoid calamity, remains silent to await the moment. The petty person, not knowing the gates of fortune and misfortune, acts and falls into punishment. Though they take every precaution, it is not enough to preserve themselves. Thus, the superior person first avoids calamity, then seeks benefit; first distances disgrace, then pursues fame. Therefore, the sage always acts beyond the formless and does not dwell on what is already formed. Thus, calamity and misfortune have no way to arrive; slander and praise cannot stain.",

The generation and transformation of things arise from resonance.\n\nLaozi said: “When mountains reach their height, clouds and rain arise; when waters reach their depth, dragons are born. When the noble man attains his Dao, his virtue and beneficence flow forth.” Those who possess hidden virtue will surely receive manifest reward; those who have concealed conduct will surely gain illustrious renown. Sowing millet will not yield sorghum; sowing resentment will bring no return of virtue.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: In the Dao of all people, the heart should be small, the aspirations great, wisdom round, conduct square, abilities many, and affairs few.\n\nWhat is called a small heart is to consider calamity before it arises, guard against misfortune, be cautious of the minute, and not dare to indulge one’s desires. Aspirations should be great, encompassing the myriad states, unifying disparate customs, with right and wrong converging like spokes toward the hub. Wisdom is round when it has no beginning or end, flowing boundlessly like a deep spring that never runs dry. Conduct is square when one stands upright without bending, remains unsullied like plain white silk, and does not alter one’s principles in poverty nor indulge one’s will in success. Many abilities mean possessing both civil and martial skills, with movement and stillness conforming to propriety, every action and decision perfectly fitting its place. Few affairs mean grasping the essentials to harmonize with the many, holding to simplicity to govern the vast, and abiding in stillness to restrain restlessness.\n\nThus, a small heart forbids even the minute; great aspirations embrace all; round wisdom knows all; square conduct refrains from all; many abilities govern all; few affairs simplify what one holds. Therefore, the sage does not neglect even the smallest good, nor does he overlook even the most subtle transgression. He does not employ shamans or diviners, yet spirits dare not precede him—this may be called the utmost nobility. Yet he trembles with caution, day by day growing more vigilant, thus achieving unity through non-action.\n\nThe foolish person’s wisdom is already meager, yet the affairs he undertakes are many; thus, every action leads to exhaustion. Governing and teaching through proper means is easy and must succeed; governing and teaching through perverse means is difficult and must fail. To abandon what is easy and certain for what is difficult and doomed—this is the result of folly.\n\nLaozi said: Fortune arises subtly and continuously; calamity emerges chaotically and tumultuously. The workings of fortune and misfortune are imperceptible, yet the sage sees their beginning and end—thus, they cannot but be examined. The enlightened ruler’s rewards and punishments are not for himself but for the state. Those who please him yet bring no benefit to the state receive no reward; those who oppose him yet benefit the state incur no punishment. Thus, one who carries righteousness fittingly is called a noble person; one who abandons righteousness fittingly is called a petty person. Those who attain understanding without toil, or toil without harm, or are harmed yet still toil—such were the ancients, who savored without ceasing. The people of today cease without savoring. When Zhou made ivory chopsticks, Jizi sighed; when Lu buried a man with wooden figurines, Confucius lamented. Seeing the beginning, they knew the end.\n\nLaozi said: Benevolence is what people admire; righteousness is what people esteem. Yet those who are admired and esteemed may perish or lose their states—this is because they do not accord with the times. Thus, one who knows benevolence and righteousness but not the weight of the age does not attain the Dao. The Five Emperors valued virtue; the Three Kings employed righteousness; the Five Hegemons relied on force. To apply the Dao of emperors and kings in the age of the Five Hegemons is not the Dao. Thus, good and bad are the same, praise and blame lie in custom; action and inaction depend on the times. Knowing Heaven’s workings and understanding human conduct—this is how one navigates the world. Knowing Heaven but not people leaves one unable to engage with the world; knowing people but not Heaven leaves one unable to wander with the Dao. A steadfast will and compliant nature make one strong, but if one’s body is enslaved by things, yin and yang consume it.\n\nThe person who attains the Dao transforms externally yet remains unchanged internally. External transformation allows one to know others; internal constancy preserves the self. Thus, one maintains an unchanging principle within while externally adapting and moving with things, never falling into error. What is prized in the Dao is its dragon-like transformation. Clinging to a single virtue or promoting one action, though it may bring fulfillment, is still to be bound by petty preferences and obstructed from the great Dao.\n\nThe Dao is still and empty, not acting upon things, nor acting for itself. Thus, when affairs proceed in accord with the Dao, it is not the Dao that acts—it is the Dao’s application. What the Dao extends to—the heavens and earth that cover and bear, the sun and moon that illuminate, the yin and yang that warm, the rain and dew that moisten, the virtue and power that support—all share a single harmony.\n\nTherefore, one who can bear the great circle walks the great square; one who mirrors the great clarity sees the great brightness; one who establishes great peace dwells in the great hall. One who can wander in darkness shines with the same light as the sun and moon. The formless is born from the formed. Thus, the true person entrusts their destiny to the numinous terrace and returns to dwell in the origin of things. They see in darkness and hear in silence. Within darkness, they alone are enlightened; within stillness, they alone are illuminated. Their use is non-use; only through non-use can they be used.",

      "translated_text": "The knowing of it is unknowing; only through unknowing can one know. The Dao is that by which things are guided; virtue is that by which life is supported. Benevolence is the proof of accumulated kindness; righteousness is the alignment of the heart with the harmony of the multitude. When the Dao declines, virtue arises; when virtue wanes, benevolence and righteousness emerge. Thus, in the highest age, one follows the Dao and does not rely on virtue; in the middle age, one upholds virtue and does not cling to it; in the lowest age, one anxiously clings to benevolence and righteousness, fearing their loss.\n\nTherefore, the noble person cannot live without righteousness; losing righteousness, they lose that by which they live. The petty person cannot survive without profit; losing profit, they lose that by which they survive. Thus, the noble person fears the loss of righteousness, while the petty person fears the loss of profit. Observe what they fear, and their fortunes and misfortunes diverge.\n\nLaozi said: Some matters, when one seeks to benefit them, only bring harm; when one seeks to harm them, they instead bring benefit. To feed one suffering from dampness, to drink when parched with heat, to clothe one in cold—these are what the multitude nurtures, yet what the good physician treats as illness. What pleases the eye and delights the heart is what the foolish pursue, but what the person of the Dao avoids. The sage first resists and later aligns; the multitude first aligns and later resists. Thus, the gate of fortune and misfortune, the reversal of benefit and harm, cannot but be examined.\n\nLaozi said: Those who achieve merit while departing from benevolence and righteousness are met with suspicion; those who commit faults yet possess benevolence and righteousness are surely trusted. Thus, benevolence and righteousness are the constant compliance of affairs, the highest honor under heaven. Even if one’s plans are shrewd and calculations sound, one must consider calamities and resolve difficulties. If in preserving the state one departs from benevolence and righteousness, their merit will surely not be accomplished. Though one’s words may not hit the mark in defense, though one’s plans bring no benefit to the state, if one’s heart is devoted to the ruler and aligned with benevolence and righteousness, their person will surely be preserved. Thus, a hundred words and a hundred plans that are never fitting are not as good as abandoning haste and carefully examining benevolence and righteousness.\n\nLaozi said: Teaching originates with the noble person, yet both noble and petty receive its blessings; profit originates with the petty person, yet both petty and noble enjoy its fruits. If noble and petty each attain their proper place, then labor is exchanged for sustenance, and the Dao flows freely. When people have many desires, righteousness is harmed; when they have many worries, wisdom is impaired. Thus, a well-governed state delights in what preserves it, while a tyrannical state delights in what destroys it. Water flows downward and becomes vast; the ruler lowers himself before his ministers and becomes enlightened. The ruler does not contend with his ministers, and the Dao of governance flows freely. Thus, the ruler is the root, the ministers the branches. There has never been a case where the root is not flourishing yet the branches are lush.\n\nLaozi said: The love of a compassionate father for his child is not for the sake of reward; it cannot be dissolved within the heart. The sage ruler’s nurturing of the people is not for personal use; it is a nature that cannot be restrained. But if one relies on their strength, depends on their merit, and inevitably exhausts it, then kindness does not reach them. Thus, employing what the multitude loves, one gains their strength; raising what the multitude delights in, one wins their hearts. Therefore, seeing their beginning, one knows their end.\n\nLaozi said: People unite through righteousness and grow strong through fellowship. Thus, where virtue is broadly applied, its authority extends far; where righteousness is thinly spread, military control is limited. Laozi said: To gain through unrighteousness and not distribute it brings calamity upon oneself. Unable to benefit others, and with nothing for oneself, one is no different from a fool who loves their child. Thus, to hold and fill it is not as good as stopping; to measure and sharpen it is not long preserved. Within virtue lies the Dao; within the Dao lies virtue. Their transformation is boundless. Within yang lies yin; within yin lies yang. All things are thus, beyond full illumination. When fortune arrives, auspicious signs appear; when misfortune comes, auspicious signs precede it. Seeing auspicious signs yet not doing good, fortune does not come; seeing inauspicious signs yet doing good, misfortune does not arrive. Benefit and harm share a gate; misfortune and fortune dwell as neighbors. None but the divine and sagely can distinguish them. Thus it is said: Misfortune leans upon fortune; fortune hides within misfortune. Who knows their limit?\n\nWhen a person is about to fall ill, they first crave rich and fatty flavors; when a state is about to perish, it first detests the words of loyal ministers. Thus, one on the verge of death cannot be saved by a good physician; a state on the verge of collapse cannot be rescued by loyal counsel. Cultivate the self, then one can govern the people; order the household, then one can be transferred to office. Thus it is said: Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true; cultivate the household, and one’s virtue overflows; cultivate the state, and one’s virtue abounds.\n\nThe people’s means of living are clothing and food. When affairs are sufficient for clothing and food, there is merit; when insufficient, there is no merit. Affairs without merit do not long endure in virtue. Thus, following the times without success requires no change in punishment; aligning with the times without success requires no change in governance. The times will return and rise—this is called the thread of the Dao.\n\nThe emperor and king enrich their people; the hegemon enriches their land; the endangered state enriches its officials. A well-governed state seems insufficient; a doomed state has empty granaries. Thus it is said: When the ruler does nothing, the people enrich themselves; when the ruler does not act, the people transform themselves.\n\nTo raise an army of a hundred thousand costs a thousand gold per day. After military campaigns, there must be lean years. Thus, weapons are inauspicious tools, not the treasures of the noble person. Reconciling great resentment inevitably leaves residual resentment.

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, those near were not drawn close by words, nor were those far dispatched by words. When the near are pleased, the far come of their own accord. Align desires with the people, and harmony arises; share their defenses, and stability is secured. Share their thoughts, and wisdom is gained; gain their strength, and wealth is acquired; gain their praise, and renown is achieved. Actions invite bandits; words bring disaster. He who speaks first finds others already whispering behind his back—such words spread a thousand *li*. Words are disaster; the tongue is a mechanism. Once spoken, even a team of four horses cannot retrieve them.\n\nFormerly, Master Zhonghuang said: Heaven has five directions, earth has five phases, sound has five notes, things have five flavors, colors have five hues, and humans have five ranks. Thus, between heaven and earth, there are twenty-five types of people. The highest five are the divine person, the perfected person, the Dao person, the realized person, and the sage. The next five are the virtuous person, the worthy person, the wise person, the good person, and the eloquent person. The middle five are the public-spirited person, the loyal person, the trustworthy person, the righteous person, and the ritual person. The next five are the scholar, the artisan, the forester, the farmer, and the merchant. The lowest five are the commoner, the servant, the foolish person, the base person, and the petty person. The highest five compared to the lowest five are as humans to oxen and horses.\n\nThe sage sees with the eyes, hears with the ears, speaks with the mouth, and walks with the feet. The perfected person sees without looking, hears without listening, follows without walking, and is impartial without speaking. Thus, what the sage uses to move the world, the perfected person has never transgressed. What the worthy person uses to correct世俗, the sage has never observed.\n\nThe so-called Dao has no front or back, no left or right. The myriad things are profoundly united, without \"is\" or \"is not,\" naturally so.\n\nLaozi said: Clarity and emptiness are heaven’s brightness; non-action is governance’s constancy. Abandon kindness and benevolence, set aside sagacity and wisdom, exclude worthiness and ability, discard benevolence and righteousness, eliminate affairs and artifices, cast away flattery and deceit, and prohibit treachery and falsehood—then the worthy and the unworthy are equalized in the Dao.\n\nStillness aligns with emptiness, and emptiness enables communication. Supreme virtue is non-action, and the myriad things are all contained. The Dao of emptiness and stillness endures as long as heaven and earth, its spirit subtle, pervading all things without dominion. The twelve months revolve in cycles, returning to their beginning. Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—though their natures conflict, their ways are interdependent. Thus, extreme cold harms things, yet without cold, it cannot be; extreme heat harms things, yet without heat, it cannot be. Therefore, what is permissible and what is not are both permissible—permissibility lies in principle. Seeing what is permissible, do not rush; seeing what is impermissible, do not cling. Permissible and impermissible alternate as left and right, as inner and outer. The essentials of all affairs must begin with unity, with timing as their guiding thread. From antiquity to the present, this has never changed—it is called the principle of heaven.\n\nAbove, grasp great clarity; below, employ its light. The Dao gives birth to the myriad things, ordering them through yin and yang, transforming them into the four seasons, dividing them into the five phases, each attaining its place and moving with the times. Standards and measures are constant. Extending downward to the incapable, ascending to the Dao without deviation, all ministers act with one mind. The Dao of heaven and earth is complete without striving, attains without seeking. Thus, we know that non-action is beneficial.\n\nLaozi said: The greatest simplicity has no form; the greatest Dao has no measure. Thus, heaven is round but does not conform to the compass, earth is square but does not conform to the carpenter’s square. From past to present is called *zhou*; the four directions and above and below are called *yu*. The Dao is within them, yet none know its place. Therefore, those whose vision is not far-reaching cannot discuss the great; those whose knowledge is not broad cannot discourse on the ultimate. Those who receive the Dao and communicate with things have no grounds for mutual reproach. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors used different methods and texts, yet their attainment of the people’s hearts was the same.\n\nAs for compasses, squares, hooks, and marking lines—these are tools of craft, not the means by which craft is achieved.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, without the zither, even a master like Shi Wen could not perfect a melody; with only the zither, one cannot evoke sorrow alone. The zither is but the instrument of sorrow, not the means by which sorrow is achieved.\n\nAs for divine harmony flowing between heart and hand, where the intent roams freely to capture the spirit, adapting to changes and manifesting through the zither—even a father cannot teach this to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. This is the untransmitted Dao.\n\nTherefore, solemnity is the ruler of form, and stillness is the master of sound. Laozi said: The Dao of heaven and earth takes virtue as its master and the Dao as its mandate. Things rectify themselves. Subtle and deeply internal, it does not value affairs; thus, it stands without awaiting achievement, is not exalted by position, does not rely on fame to be manifest, requires no ritual to be dignified, and needs no force to be strong. Thus, when the Dao is established, there is no teaching; when illumination shines, there is no scrutiny. The Dao is established without teaching because it does not usurp others’ abilities; illumination shines without scrutiny because it does not harm their affairs.\n\nThose who teach the Dao act contrary to virtue and harm things. Thus, yin and yang, the four seasons, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth share the same Dao but differ in principle; the myriad things share the same nature but differ in form. The wise do not teach one another, and the skilled do not transmit to one another. Therefore, the sage establishes laws to guide the people’s hearts, allowing each to follow their nature. Thus, the living bear no gratitude, the dead hold no resentment. Heaven and earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs; the sage is not benevolent, treating the hundred clans as straw dogs.\n\nCompassion, love, benevolence, and righteousness are the Dao of the narrow and near. The narrow, when entering the great, becomes lost; the near, when journeying far, becomes confused. The sage’s Dao enters the great without confusion, journeys far without bewilderment, ever empty and self-guarding—this is called the ultimate Heavenly virtue.\n\nLaozi said: The sage covers like heaven, bears like earth, illuminates like the sun and moon, harmonizes like yin and yang, transforms like the four seasons, embraces the myriad things without sameness. Without old or new, without estrangement or intimacy, thus one who models heaven—heaven does not have a single season; earth does not have a single material; people do not have a single affair. Affairs and undertakings are manifold, paths and actions are diverse.\n\nThus, in warfare, some are light, some heavy, some greedy, some incorruptible—these four are opposite and cannot be unified. The light wish to advance, the heavy wish to halt; the greedy wish to seize, the incorruptible do not covet what is not theirs. Therefore, the brave may be ordered to charge but not to hold firm; the heavy may be ordered to defend but not to assault the enemy; the greedy may be ordered to attack and seize but not to distribute wealth; the incorruptible may be ordered to uphold their duty but not to advance and seize; the trustworthy may be ordered to uphold agreements but not to respond to change. These five the sage employs together, assigning tasks according to their abilities.\n\nHeaven and earth embrace no single thing; yin and yang produce no single qi; rivers and seas do not refuse the waters of streams to become great; mountains and forests do not reject crooked branches to become lofty. The sage does not reject the words of a firewood bearer to broaden his reputation. To cling to one corner and neglect the ten thousand directions, to take one thing and discard the rest—what is gained is little, and what is governed is shallow.\n\nLaozi said: What heaven covers, earth bears, the sun and moon illuminate—forms differ, natures vary, each has what brings it peace and joy. Yet what brings joy is also what brings sorrow; what brings peace is also what brings danger.\n\nThus, the sage’s governance of the people allows each to suit their nature, to dwell where they are at ease, to do what they are capable of, to fulfill their needs, and to apply what is fitting. In this way, the myriad things are equal, none surpassing another. Among the things of the world, there is no inherent nobility or baseness. What is valued is valued according to its worth, and all things are noble; what is deemed base is base according to its nature, and all things are base. Thus, not exalting the worthy means not casting fish into trees or sinking birds into the abyss.\n\nIn the past, when Yao governed the world, Shun was Minister of Instruction, Xie was Minister of War, Yu was Minister of Works, Hou Ji was Minister of Agriculture, and Xi Zhong was Master of Craftsmen. In guiding the people, those by the water fished, those in the forests gathered, those in the valleys herded, those on the hills farmed, and those in the lowlands wove nets. On the slopes, they tilled the fields. Thus, the people used what they had to exchange for what they lacked, used their skills to exchange for what they were unskilled in. Therefore, those who rebelled were few, and those who obeyed were many. Like the wind passing through the reeds, they responded instantly, each according to its pitch, all seeking what benefited them and avoiding what harmed them.\n\nThus, neighboring states were within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard across borders, yet footprints did not reach the lands of other lords, and cart tracks did not extend a thousand *li* beyond. All were content in their dwellings.\n\nTherefore, a disordered state appears full, a well-governed state appears empty; a ruined state appears insufficient, a preserved state appears abundant. The empty is not without people—each guards their duty. The full is not overpopulated—all are entangled in trivialities. The abundant is not rich in wealth—desires are restrained and affairs are few. The insufficient is not without goods—people are few and expenditures are many.\n\nThus, the laws of the former kings were not of their own making but what they followed. Their prohibitions and punishments were not of their own doing but what they upheld. This is the Dao of supreme virtue.\n\nLaozi said: To govern the world with the Dao is not to alter human nature but to follow what is already there and guide it to flourish. Thus, following brings greatness, while acting brings smallness. The ancients who dredged waterways followed the flow of water; those who cultivated crops followed the suitability of the land; those who waged war followed the people’s desires. To be able to follow is to be invincible under heaven.\n\nThings must have their natural course before human affairs can be well-ordered.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the laws established by the former kings were framed in accordance with the people’s nature, setting limits and patterns for them. Without their inherent nature, they could not be made to follow teachings; with their nature but without its resources, they could not be made to adhere to the Way. Human nature possesses the resources of benevolence and righteousness, yet without the laws and institutions crafted by the sage, they cannot be guided toward proper conduct. By leveraging what they detest to prohibit villainy, punishments become unnecessary, and authority operates as if by divine power. By aligning with their nature, the world submits; by opposing their nature, laws and institutions are enacted yet remain unused. Thus, the Dao is the foundation of merit and fame, and what the people cherish. When the people cherish it, merit and fame are established.\n\nThe ancients who excelled as rulers modeled themselves after rivers and seas. Rivers and seas achieve their greatness through non-action, their vastness through humility. Thus, they endure long as the valleys of the world, their virtue sufficient. Through non-action, they gather all streams; through non-seeking, they attain; through non-movement, they reach. Therefore, they govern the world without strife. By not exalting themselves, they become rich; by not displaying themselves, they become illustrious; by not boasting, they become leaders; by not possessing, they become kings of the world. By not contending, none can contend with them. By never considering themselves great, they achieve greatness. Rivers and seas are close to the Dao, thus they endure long, preserving harmony with heaven and earth.\n\nWhen kings and lords cultivate the Dao, their achievements are accomplished without possession. Without possession, they become strong and steadfast; steadfastness without oppression is the profoundness of the human Way. Profoundness in virtue leads to profoundness in merit and fame, which is called \"profound virtue.\" It is distant, yet in its relation to things, it is contrary. The world has a beginning, yet none know its principle. Only the sage understands its workings: it is neither male nor female, neither yin nor yang; it gives birth yet does not die. Heaven and earth form it, yin and yang shape it, and the myriad things are born through it. Thus, yin and yang possess roundness and squareness, shortness and length, existence and extinction. The Dao decrees their fate. It is profound and tranquil, unburdened in the mind; subtle and fitting in the Dao. Life and death share the same principle; the transformations of the myriad things unite in the One Dao. Simplicity gives rise to life, forgetting death—wherever one goes, longevity is assured. Abandoning affairs and words, practicing caution and non-action, guarding the Dao, and being meticulous in all things—this is not to dominate. Utmost subtlety is formless, the beginning of heaven and earth, the commonality of the myriad things in the Dao, yet their forms differ. Utmost subtlety is without substance, thus it can encompass all; utmost vastness is without limit, thus it becomes the myriad things. The subtlest is without interior, thus it is the honored of the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao preserves life; virtue stabilizes form. The measure of the supreme Dao is to abandon likes and dislikes, to be without knowledge, thus making intentions harmonious and the mind at peace. Do not oppose the Dao with the mind. Heaven and earth unite as one, divide into two, and reunite. Above and below do not err. Unite as one, divide into five, and reunite—this must accord with the compass and square.\n\nThe Dao is most intimate yet cannot be estranged; closest yet cannot be distant. Those who seek it afar go forth and return. Laozi said: The emperor is named, yet none know his essence; the emperor values his virtue; the king esteems righteousness; the hegemon understands principle. The sage’s Dao in relation to things is without possession. When the Dao is narrow, then wisdom is employed; when virtue is shallow, then punishments are employed; when clarity is dim, then scrutiny is employed. Employing wisdom leads to inner chaos; employing punishments leads to resentment between superiors and inferiors; employing scrutiny leads subordinates to seek goodness in serving superiors, resulting in exhaustion. Thus, the sage adapts to heaven and earth, transforming their virtue. Heaven covers and earth bears; the Dao nurtures with timeliness. When nurturing is abundant, governance is achieved. Even with divine sagacity, how can it be altered? Abandoning cunning and reducing punishments, returning to clarity and stillness—things will right themselves.\n\nThe Dao as ruler is like a corpse: solemn, profound, and silent, yet the world receives its blessings. One person is covered without excess; ten thousand are covered without constraint. Thus, heavily bestowing favors or heavily imposing violence opposes the Dao. Bestowing favors is distributing alms: rewarding without merit and ennobling without labor causes those who uphold their duties to slacken in office and idlers to hasten in advancement. Violence is wanton execution: killing the innocent and those who follow the Way results in the death penalty. Those who cultivate themselves are not encouraged toward goodness, and those who engage in villainy lightly offend their superiors. Thus, bestowing favors breeds villainy; violence breeds chaos. Villainy and chaos are the customs of a ruined state, the winds of national collapse.\n\nTherefore, when the state executes, the ruler does not anger; when the court rewards, the lord does not participate. Those executed do not resent the ruler, for their crimes are fitting; those rewarded do not feel indebted to the superior, for their achievements are deserved. The people’s punishments and rewards arise from themselves. Thus, they strive for merit and cultivate their conduct, not receiving gifts from others. Therefore, the court is pristine without traces, and the fields are opened without weeds.\n\nThus, the supreme ruler is unknown yet possesses it; the kingly Way resides in non-action, practices the teaching of non-words, remains clear and still, unmoving, steadfast without wavering. It follows and entrusts to subordinates, holds them accountable without labor, devises without miscalculations, acts without errors, speaks without embellishment, conducts without formalities. Advancing and retreating respond to the times; movement and stillness follow principle. Beauty and ugliness are not favored or detested; rewards and punishments do not bring joy or anger. Names are self-assigned; affairs proceed naturally, arising not from oneself. To grasp it is to depart from it; to adorn it is to harm it.\n\nHeaven’s qi forms the hun; earth’s qi forms the po. Reversed, the profound mystery resides in its abode—guard it and do not lose it. Above, it communicates with the Great One; the essence of the Great One unites with heaven. Heaven’s Dao is silent, without form or rule, vast beyond measure, deep beyond fathoming. Constantly transforming with people, wisdom cannot grasp it; revolving without end, its transformations are like the divine. Emptiness and non-action follow, always following without leading. In governing, it listens with an empty mind, weak will, clarity, and brightness, without obscurity. Thus, all ministers converge, advancing together. Whether foolish or wise, worthy or unworthy, none do not exhaust their abilities. The ruler attains what controls ministers; ministers attain what serves the ruler—thus the governance of the state is illuminated.\n\nLaozi said: One who is knowledgeable yet fond of inquiry is a sage; one who is brave yet fond of inquiry prevails. Relying on the wisdom of the multitude, there is nothing one cannot undertake; employing the strength of the multitude, there is nothing one cannot overcome. Relying on the strength of the multitude, even Wu Huo is not sufficient to depend on; harnessing the power of the multitude, the world is not sufficient to employ. Without authority, one cannot create momentum; without following the principles of the Dao, even a sage cannot succeed.

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: What is called \"non-action\" does not mean that when pulled, one does not come; when pushed, one does not leave; when pressed, one does not respond; when moved, one does not act; when rigid, one does not flow; when clenched, one does not disperse. Rather, it means that private intentions do not interfere with the public Dao, and desires do not obstruct rightful methods. One follows principle in undertaking affairs and relies on available resources to establish merit. Yielding to the natural course of things, one cannot be forced into action. When affairs are accomplished, the self does not boast; when merit is established, the name is not claimed.\n\nAs for water requiring boats, sand requiring embankments, mud requiring sledges, mountains requiring carrying frames, summer channels and winter reservoirs—forming mountains from heights and ponds from lowlands—these are not what I have done. The sage is not ashamed of a humble position or the failure of the Dao to prevail, nor does he worry about the brevity of life but rather the suffering of the people. Thus, he remains ever empty and practices non-action, embracing simplicity and preserving purity, not mingling with external things.\n\nLaozi said: The ancient establishment of emperors and kings was not to indulge their desires. The sage who ascends the throne does not seek ease and pleasure for himself. For the people of the world, the strong oppress the weak, the many bully the few, the cunning deceive the foolish, and the brave invade the timid. Moreover, they harbor deceitful wisdom without teaching one another and accumulate wealth without sharing it. Therefore, the Son of Heaven was established to unify their conduct. As one person’s wisdom cannot illuminate all under heaven, the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were established to assist him. For distant lands and foreign customs beyond the reach of grace, feudal lords were established to instruct them. Thus, heaven and earth, the four seasons—none fail to respond. No affairs are concealed in the government, and no benefits are overlooked in the state. Clothing the cold, feeding the hungry, nurturing the elderly and weak, and relieving the weary—none are neglected.\n\nShennong appeared emaciated, Yao was gaunt, Shun was swarthy, Yu had calloused hands and feet, Yi Yin carried a cauldron to seek Tang, Lü Wang butchered to enter Zhou, Baili Xi was sold as a slave, Guan Zhong was bound, Confucius had no soot on his chimney, and Mozi had no warmth on his mat. They did not covet emoluments or esteem positions but sought to initiate benefits for the world and eliminate harms for the people. From the Son of Heaven to the common folk, if the body does not labor and the mind does not toil in affairs, those seeking sustenance have never been heard of.\n\nLaozi said: What is called the Son of Heaven possesses the heavenly Dao to establish the world. The Dao for establishing the world is to grasp the One as safeguard, return to the root, practice non-action, emptiness, and stillness, without presence, without bounds, without limits, without end. Gazing at it, no form is seen; listening to it, no sound is heard. This is called the warp of the Great Dao.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao embodies roundness yet models itself on squareness; it turns its back on yin yet embraces yang; it is yielding on the left yet firm on the right; it treads the obscure yet bears the bright. Its transformations are boundless, yet by attaining the origin of the One, it responds to all directions. This is called divine illumination. Heaven is round and without end, so its form cannot be observed; earth is square and without edge, so its gate cannot be glimpsed. Heaven’s transformations proceed without form; earth’s growth has no measure. Among things, there are those that prevail, but only the Dao has no rival. The reason it has no rival is that it has no constant form or power.\n\nThe wheel turns endlessly, resembling the movement of the sun and moon, like the alternation of spring and autumn, the succession of day and night—ending and beginning again, brightening and darkening. It shapes form yet has no form, thus its achievements can be accomplished. It treats things as things yet is not a thing, thus it prevails without exhaustion. Those who excel in warfare become emperors; those who excel in divine transformation become kings. Those who excel in warfare emulate the heavenly Dao; those who excel in divine transformation illuminate the four seasons. By cultivating rectitude within their borders, distant lands cherish their virtue; by securing victory before battle, the feudal lords submit as guests.\n\nThe ancients who attained the Dao were still and emulated heaven and earth; when active, they followed the sun and moon. Their joy and anger aligned with the four seasons; their commands were like thunder, their voices not discordant with the eight winds. Their bending and extending did not violate the five measures. They acted according to the people’s desires and harnessed their strength, removing cruelty and eliminating harm. Those who share benefits die for one another; those who share sentiments achieve together; those who share conduct assist one another. Moving in accord with oneself, the world becomes a battleground.\n\nThus, those who are skilled in employing troops employ them for their own purposes; those who are unskilled employ them for personal gain. Employing them for their own purposes, none under heaven cannot be employed; employing them for personal gain, not a single person can be employed.\n\nIn cultivating virtue, the highest is to nurture the spirit; next is to nurture the body. When the spirit is clear and the mind is calm, all joints are at peace—this is the foundation of nurturing life. Nourishing the flesh, filling the belly, and satisfying desires are the lesser aspects of nurturing life. In governing the state, the highest is to cultivate transformation; next is to rectify the law. When the people yield to one another in disputes, dwell in humility, contend for little, and strive for labor, they daily transform and ascend toward goodness without knowing why—this is the foundation of governance. Using rewards to encourage goodness and fear of punishment to prevent wrongdoing, with laws rectified above and the people obedient below—this is the lesser aspect of governance. The ancients nurtured the root, while later ages attended to the branches.\n\nLaozi said: Rulers capable of governance do not appear in every generation; ministers capable of assisting governance are not one in ten thousand. Seeking one in ten thousand from those who do not appear in every generation—this is why supreme governance occurs but once in a thousand years. The achievements of hegemons and kings are not established in every generation. Following their good intentions and guarding against their perverse thoughts, if ruler and people share the same path, the people can be good and customs can be refined. What is valued in the sage is not his creation of punishments to follow crimes but his knowledge of where chaos arises.\n\nIf one opens the sharp edge and indulges it, letting depravity and excess run rampant and then attempting to restrain them with laws and punishments, even if the world is cruelly oppressed, their treachery cannot be suppressed.\n\nLaozi said: Though the body dwells by rivers and seas, if the heart remains in the palace halls, one values life; valuing life, one轻利. Even if one cannot overcome this, following it does no harm to the spirit. If one cannot overcome it yet forcibly resists, this is called double injury. A doubly injured person does not live long. Thus it is said: Knowing harmony is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity. Increasing life is called auspicious; forcing qi is called strength. This is called using its light and returning to its clarity.\n\nLaozi said: Nothing under heaven is easier than doing good; nothing is harder than doing evil. What is called doing good is stillness and non-action, suiting one’s nature, rejecting excess, and having no temptations. Following one’s nature and preserving authenticity without changing oneself—thus it is said that doing good is easy. What is called doing evil is difficult: regicide, deceit, restlessness, and excessive desires are not human nature. Thus it is said that doing evil is difficult.\n\nNow, the great affliction arises from having no constant standard and being insatiable in measurement. Therefore, the juncture of benefit and harm, fortune and misfortune, cannot but be examined. The sage has no desires and no aversions. Sometimes desiring something is just enough to lose it; sometimes avoiding something is just enough to encounter it. If the mind has desires, it forgets what it is doing. Thus, the sage examines the changes between activity and stillness and adapts to the measure of giving and receiving. Harmonizing the emotions of liking and disliking, balancing the nodes of joy and anger—when activity and stillness are proper, calamities do not invade.",

      "translated_text": "Receiving and giving in proper measure, transgressions do not accumulate. Regulating likes and dislikes, worries do not approach. Harmonizing joy and anger, resentments do not arise. Those who embody the Dao do not seize improper gains nor yield to misfortune; they do not discard what is not theirs nor restrain what is constantly full, yet do not overflow. Ever empty, they are easily sustained. Thus, when one measures with the Dao and its arts, food fills the void, and clothing wards off cold—enough for warmth and sustenance of this seven-foot form.\n\nWithout the measure of Dao and its arts, one who seeks honor and nobility finds even the power of ten thousand chariots insufficient for joy, and the wealth of the world insufficient for delight. Therefore, the sage’s mind is level, their will is yielding, their spirit guards within, and external things cannot delude.\n\nLaozi said: \"One who overcomes others is strong, but one who overcomes themselves is mighty. To be mighty is necessarily to employ the strength of others. To employ the strength of others is necessarily to win their hearts. To win their hearts is necessarily to have first mastered oneself. Never has one who has mastered themselves lost others; never has one who has lost themselves gained others.\"\n\nThus, the foundation of governance lies in pacifying the people. The foundation of pacifying the people lies in satisfying their needs. The foundation of satisfying their needs lies in not seizing their time. The foundation of not seizing their time lies in reducing affairs. The foundation of reducing affairs lies in moderating expenditures. The foundation of moderating expenditures lies in eliminating arrogance. The foundation of eliminating arrogance lies in emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThose who understand the nature of life do not pursue what life inherently lacks. Those who understand the nature of fate do not worry over what fate inherently denies. Why then do the eyes delight in the five colors, the mouth crave rich flavors, the ears indulge in the five sounds, and the seven apertures contend with one another, harming the singular nature? Day by day, perverse desires drain the harmony of heaven. If one cannot govern their own body, how can they govern the world?\n\nWhat is meant by \"gaining the world\" is not to tread upon power and rank, nor to claim titles of honor, but to move the hearts of the world and gain the strength of the world. To have the name of facing south (as ruler) yet lack the praise of even one person—this is to lose the world. Thus, Jie and Zhou were not true kings, while Tang and Wu were not mere exiles.\n\nWhen the Son of Heaven attains the Dao, his guard lies in the four barbarian tribes; when he loses the Dao, his guard lies among the feudal lords. When the feudal lords attain the Dao, their guard lies within their four borders; when they lose the Dao, their guard lies among their attendants. Thus it is said: \"Do not rely on others not seizing from you; rely on what cannot be seized from you.\" To practice a way that can be seized, even without regicidal or usurping conduct, is of no benefit in preserving the world.\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who govern well do not alter the old nor change the constant. Anger is contrary to virtue; weapons are instruments of misfortune; contention is the source of human disorder. Plotting in secret, opposing virtue, delighting in instruments of misfortune, and governing human disorder—this is the height of perversity. Without harming others, one cannot complete harm. It is better to blunt their sharpness, untangle their knots, harmonize their light, and blend with their dust.\n\nHuman nature and emotions all wish to be wiser than others and resent falling short. Wishing to be wiser breeds contention; resenting falling short breeds grievance. Contention and grievance arise, the mind is disordered, and qi flows contrary. Thus, the sage-kings of old withdrew from contention and grievance. When contention and grievance do not arise, the mind is ordered and qi flows smoothly. Therefore, it is said: 'Do not exalt worthiness, and the people will not contend.'\n\nLaozi said: \"Those who govern things do not do so through things, but through harmony. Those who govern harmony do not do so through harmony, but through people. Those who govern people do not do so through people, but through the ruler. Those who govern the ruler do not do so through the ruler, but through desire. Those who govern desire do not do so through desire, but through nature. Those who govern nature do not do so through nature, but through virtue. Those who govern virtue do not do so through virtue, but through the Dao. The Dao is the root of human nature. Without depravity or filth, long immersed in things, one forgets their origin and merges with their inherent nature.\n\nClothing, food, rites, and customs are not human nature; they are received from without. Thus, human nature desires equilibrium, but cravings harm it. Only those with the Dao can forsake external things and return to themselves. With self-reflection, one does not lose the true nature of things; without it, one acts in confusion, driven by desires. Indulging desires and losing one’s nature, one’s actions are never correct. In governing life, one loses the body; in governing the state, one brings chaos to the people. Thus, those who have not heard the Dao have no way to return to their nature.\n\nThe sages of old attained it within themselves, so their commands were executed and prohibitions observed. In all undertakings, one must first calm the mind and clarify the spirit. When the spirit is clear and the mind calm, things can be properly perceived. If one is misled by false praise or the eyes seduced by dazzling colors, it is difficult to achieve correctness in affairs. Therefore, emptiness is prized.\n\nWhen water is agitated, waves arise; when qi is disordered, wisdom is clouded. Clouded wisdom cannot be correct; turbulent water cannot be level. Thus, the sage-kings held to the One to govern the nature of things. The One is most precious, without preference in the world. The sage-kings entrusted themselves to impartiality, thus issuing commands for the world.\n\nLaozi said: \"Yin and yang shape the myriad things, all riding the single qi to be born. When above and below are divided in heart, qi rises and steams upward. When ruler and minister are not in harmony, the five grains do not ripen. Spring’s severity, autumn’s glory, winter’s thunder, and summer’s frost—all arise from the harm done to qi.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, it is as one body; within the six directions, it is as one form. Thus, one who is enlightened about nature cannot be coerced by heaven and earth; one who is discerning about omens cannot be deluded by strange phenomena. The sage infers the distant from the near, taking the ten thousand li as one. Qi steams between heaven and earth. Without rites, propriety, integrity, and shame, the people would all encroach upon one another, violent and cruel, still within the state of chaotic defense.\n\nWhen integrity and shame decline, and the age decays, expenditures multiply while resources dwindle. Labor is taxed, yet sustenance is insufficient. The people grow poor and bitter, and resentful contention arises. Thus, benevolence is prized, and the base are despised. Cliques form, factions gather, each promoting their allies, harboring schemes and cunning deceit—thus, righteousness is prized. Men and women dwell in mixed groups without distinction—thus, propriety is prized. The passions of life and fate press upon one another, and when unable to do otherwise, there is no harmony—thus, music is prized.\n\nTherefore, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and music are means to remedy decay, not the way of universal governance. If one can truly stabilize the spirit and clarity in the world, and return the heart to its origin, then the people’s nature is good. When the people’s nature is good, heaven and earth, yin and yang encompass them. Resources are sufficient, and the people are sustained. Greed, pettiness, and resentful contention do not arise. Benevolence and righteousness are not employed, yet the Dao and virtue are established in the world, and the people are not seduced by dazzling colors.\n\nThus, when virtue declines, then benevolence and righteousness are adorned; when harmony is lost, then sounds are harmonized; when propriety is excessive, then appearances are adorned. Therefore, only by knowing the Dao and virtue can one know that benevolence and righteousness are insufficient to practice. Only by knowing benevolence and righteousness can one know that propriety and music are insufficient to cultivate.\n\nLaozi said: \"The governance of clarity and stillness is harmonious and compliant, tranquil and serene, pure and unadorned, leisurely and unhurried. Within, it accords with the Dao; without, it harmonizes with all.\"",

Their hearts are harmonious and free from pretense; their affairs are plain and unadorned. They do not scheme about beginnings nor debate endings. At ease, they remain; when urged, they act. Their bodies permeate Heaven and Earth, their essence aligns with yin and yang, their harmony unites the four seasons. Bright and luminous as the sun and moon, they transform through the Dao.\n\nThose who craft deception and falsehood cannot bear the weight of their hearts. Thus, Heaven covers with virtue, Earth bears with joy; the four seasons do not lose their order, wind and rain do not turn tyrannical. The sun and moon are clear and still, their radiance undiminished; the five planets do not deviate from their courses—this is the illumination of clarity and stillness.\n\nLaozi said: The duties of governing a well-ordered world are easy to uphold; its affairs are easy to perform; its rituals are easy to practice; its obligations are easy to fulfill.

Those who scorn the world and despise material things do not follow the common tide—such is the lofty conduct of scholars—yet a well-ordered world does not take this as a model for transforming the people. Thus, what is unattainably high is not taken as a measure for people; conduct that cannot be matched is not made the custom of the state. Therefore, talents cannot be monopolized, but measures, the Dao, and arts can be transmitted through the ages.\n\nThus, a well-governed state can be maintained even by the foolish, and military affairs can be unified through law. One need not await the heroes of antiquity, for people are self-sufficient when their existing qualities are employed together.

      "translated_text": "The people, oppressed by these three impositions, adorn their wisdom to deceive their superiors, commit transgressions to act perilously—even with strict laws and severe punishments, their treachery cannot be suppressed. When beasts are cornered, they gore; when birds are cornered, they peck; when people are cornered, they deceive. This is what it means.\n\nLaozi said: The sound of thunder can be imitated by bells and drums; the changes of wind and rain can be known through musical harmony. What is vast enough to be seen can be measured; what is bright enough to be visible can be obscured; sounds that can be heard can be tuned; colors that can be perceived can be distinguished. Yet the greatest cannot be contained even by Heaven and Earth, and the most subtle cannot be seen even by spirits. When laws and calendars are established, the five colors distinguished, and the pure and turbid, sweet and bitter flavors differentiated, simplicity scatters and becomes tools. When benevolence and righteousness are instituted, rites and music refined, virtue shifts and becomes artifice.\n\nThe people adorn their wisdom to startle the foolish, devise deceit to assail their superiors—though the world may have those who can grasp this, none can govern by it. For the more wisdom and ability proliferate, the more virtue declines. Thus, the perfected person preserves simplicity and does not scatter it.\n\nThe governance of the perfected person is emptiness and stillness, without visible desires. The mind abides with spirit, form harmonizes with nature, calm embodies virtue, and movement accords with principle. Following the natural Dao, acting only when unavoidable, they remain indifferent and non-active, and the world is in harmony. Without desires, the people naturally return to simplicity. Without contention, wealth suffices. The giver does not claim virtue, the receiver does not decline; virtue returns of itself, yet none regard it as a favor.

      "translated_text": "The inexhaustible—none know whence its bounty flows—is called *Yaoguang*. *Yaoguang* is the sustenance and provision of the myriad things.\n\nLaozi said: Heaven cherishes its essence, Earth cherishes its equilibrium, and humans cherish their emotions. Heaven’s essence is the sun, moon, stars, thunder, wind, and rain; Earth’s equilibrium is water, fire, metal, wood, and soil; human emotions are thought, reflection, hearing, clarity, joy, and anger. Thus, closing the four gates and halting the five pathways, one merges with the Dao, and spirit and luminosity conceal themselves in formlessness. Essence and qi return to truth: the eyes are bright yet do not see, the ears are keen yet do not hear, the mouth is proper yet does not speak, the mind is orderly and penetrating yet does not think. Abandoning action, knowing yet not presuming, one aligns with the true nature of life and destiny, thus remaining unharmed. When essence abides in the eyes, their vision is clear; when it abides in the ears, their hearing is sharp; when it lingers in the mouth, speech is fitting; when it gathers in the heart, thought is penetrating. Therefore, closing the four gates ensures a lifetime without affliction. The four limbs and nine orifices neither die nor live—this is the *zhenren* (Perfected Person). Earth’s generation of wealth and resources stems from nothing beyond the five phases. The sage regulates the five phases and thus governs without disorder.\n\nLaozi said: The balance scale, unbiased toward left or right, can determine evenness; thus it may serve as a level. The marking line, unbiased toward inner or outer, can determine straightness; thus it may serve as a standard. The ruler, unbiased in likes or dislikes, can establish laws; thus decrees may be issued. Virtue establishes no grudges, conceals no resentments—this is following the Dao and harmonizing with the human heart. Therefore, in governance, wisdom does not interfere. Water’s turbulence capsizes boats, wood’s impact snaps axles—yet one does not resent wood or stone but blames the clumsy and inept, for wisdom does not bear the burden. Thus, the Dao, when infused with cunning, breeds chaos; virtue, when infused with intent, breeds peril; the mind, when infused with scrutiny, breeds obscurity. The balance scale, compass, and square are fixed and unchanging, constant and unerring, square in movement yet unobstructed. In a single day, their form endures for ten thousand generations, their transmission lies in non-action. The One is non-action; the hundred kings employed it, and its transmission through the ages remains unaltered.\n\nLaozi said: People say, “A state may have a ruler who perishes, but the world never lacks the Dao. A person may face ruin, but principle knows no obstruction.” Thus, non-action is the root of the Dao. One who grasps this root responds to all without limit. Therefore, one does not rely on the calculations of principle but instead on one’s own ability—such limitation is not far off. The ruler who does not step beyond his chamber yet knows the world does so by relying on things to understand things, on people to understand people. Thus, the accumulated strength of many achieves what cannot be overcome; the collective wisdom of the multitude accomplishes what cannot fail. A thousand people do not exhaust their provisions; ten thousand do not abandon their tasks. Artisans do not practice disparate skills; officials do not hold concurrent posts. Each guards their duty without interference, people find their proper place, and things attain their peace. Thus, tools and implements are not faulty, and duties are not neglected. Debts are few and easily repaid; responsibilities are few and easily upheld. Tasks are light and easily encouraged. The ruler holds to minimal constraints, and the people emulate deeds that are easily accomplished. Thus, ruler and minister endure without mutual weariness.\n\nLaozi said: The emperor embodies the Great Unity; the king models the yin and yang; the hegemon follows the four seasons; the ruler employs the six pitch-pipes. One who embodies the Great Unity understands the nature of Heaven and Earth, penetrates the principles of the Dao and virtue. Their clarity and brightness illuminate like the sun and moon; their spirit and essence communicate with the myriad things. Their movement and stillness harmonize with yin and yang; their joy and anger align with the four seasons. Their covering and dew are the Dao, impartial and all-pervading. Even the smallest flying or creeping creatures depend on virtue to live, and virtue flows beyond boundaries while their fame is transmitted to later generations.\n\nThose who model yin and yang inherit the harmony of Heaven and Earth, their virtue equaling Heaven and Earth, their brilliance paralleling the sun and moon, their spirit and essence rivaling the gods. Wearing the round and treading the square, embracing the exterior and resting by the marking line, they inwardly govern the self and outwardly win the hearts of the people. When they issue commands, the world follows like the wind. Thus, the four seasons—spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s storage—take and give in measure, proceed and withdraw in balance. Joy and anger, firmness and softness do not depart from principle: soft yet not brittle, firm yet not broken, broad yet not indulgent, solemn yet not harsh. At ease and yielding, they nurture the multitude. Their virtue embraces the foolish and accommodates the unworthy, without partiality or favoritism.\n\nThose who employ the six pitch-pipes govern life and death, reward and punishment, giving and taking.",

      "translated_text": "There is no Dao apart from this. To suppress disorder and restrain violence, to promote the worthy and dismiss the unworthy, to correct the crooked and make it straight, to cast out danger and make it level—this is to be clear about the Dao of giving and withholding, opening and closing, riding the moment and following the trend to subdue and employ the hearts of the people.\n\nIf an emperor does not embody yin and yang, he encroaches upon the kings; if a king does not follow the four seasons, he is diminished; if a hegemon does not employ the six pitch-pipes, he is humiliated; if a ruler loses the marking line, he is discarded. Thus, one who acts greatly in small matters will be blocked and estranged; one who acts small in great matters will be narrow and intolerant.\n\nLaozi said: \"Though the land be vast and the people numerous, this is not true strength. Though armor be sturdy and weapons sharp, these cannot be relied upon for victory. Though walls be high and moats deep, these are not true defense. Though punishments be severe and penalties harsh, these are not true authority.\" Those who govern for survival, though small, will surely survive; those who govern for ruin, though great, will surely perish.\n\nThus, the skilled defender has none to resist him; the skilled warrior has none to fight. Riding the moment and following the people’s desires, the world submits. Therefore, the good governor accumulates virtue; the good commander stores up anger. Virtue accumulated, the people may be employed; anger stored, authority may be established. Where culture reaches deeply, the power of submission is great; where virtue is spread widely, the reach of authority is broad. Broadness makes me strong and the enemy weak. The skilled commander first weakens the enemy, then fights—thus expending half the effort for tenfold the result. A state of a thousand chariots that practices civil virtue will rule; a state of ten thousand chariots that delights in war will perish.\n\nVictorious troops first secure victory, then fight; defeated troops first fight, then seek victory—this is not understanding the Dao.\n\nIn highest benevolence, Laozi said: \"The Dao of the noble person is tranquility for self-cultivation, frugality for nurturing life. Tranquil, one does not disturb those below; undisturbed below, the people do not resent. Disturbed below, governance is chaotic; the people resentful, virtue is thin. With chaotic governance, the worthy do not offer counsel; with thin virtue, the brave do not fight.\"\n\nThe disordered ruler is not thus. In a single day, he possesses the wealth of the world and the power of the throne, exhausting the people’s strength to serve his sensory desires. His will is fixed on palaces and terraces, moats and ponds, parks and gardens, fierce beasts and rare treasures. The poor starve while tigers and wolves feast on fodder; the people freeze while the palace is clad in brocade. Thus, the ruler accumulates these useless things, and the world cannot secure its own lives.\n\nLaozi said: \"Without simplicity, virtue cannot be made clear; without tranquility, the distant cannot be reached; without breadth, all cannot be covered; without uprightness and balance, decisions cannot be made.\" With the eyes of the world, one sees; with the ears of the world, one hears; with the heart of the world, one deliberates; with the strength of the world, one contends. Thus, commands penetrate below, and the sentiments of ministers rise above. All officials are well-ordered, all ministers converge like spokes to a hub. Joy is not expressed through rewards, anger not through punishment. Laws are clear but not harsh; ears and eyes are sharp but not dim. The sentiments of good and bad are daily presented before one without obstruction. Thus, the worthy exhaust their wisdom, the unworthy exert their strength; those near are at ease in their nature, those far cherish their virtue. This is the Dao of employing people.\n\nOne who rides a carriage or horse does not labor yet reaches a thousand *li*; one who rides a boat and oars does not guard yet crosses rivers and seas. If words are right, though they come from a woodcutter or herdsman, they cannot be discarded; if words are wrong, though they come from a lord or minister, they cannot be used. Right and wrong cannot be judged by nobility or baseness, honor or lowliness. If a plan is useful, one need not be ashamed of its source; if words can be put into action, one need not value their eloquence.\n\nThe benighted ruler is not thus. Among his ministers, those who offer utmost sincerity and loyalty are rare; he does not employ their persons but instead befriends the crooked. The worthy cannot be seen; the distant and lowly who exhaust their strength in loyalty cannot be heard. Those who speak are confounded with words; those who remonstrate are punished with crimes. Wishing thus to pacify the world and preserve the myriad regions, he distances himself from clarity and wisdom.\n\nLaozi said: \"One who values life, though rich and noble, does not harm the body with excess; though poor and lowly, does not burden the form with profit.\" Now, inheriting the hereditary rank of one’s ancestors, one must value not losing it—life’s origin is long indeed. To lightly lose it, is this not delusion? He who values his person in governing the world can be entrusted with the world; he who cherishes his person in governing the world can be relied upon with the world.\n\nWenzi asked about the foundation of governing a state. Laozi said: \"The foundation lies in governing the self. I have never heard of one whose self is well-governed yet whose state is in chaos. Nor have I heard of one whose self is in chaos yet whose state is well-governed.\" Thus it is said: \"Cultivate the self, and one’s virtue becomes true.\" The subtlety of the Dao is such that a father cannot teach it to his son, nor can a son receive it from his father. Thus, \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\n\nWenzi asked: \"What conduct makes the people cherish their superiors?\" Laozi said: \"Employ them in due season and treat them with reverence, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading thin ice. Between heaven and earth, the good are my charges; the not-good are my enemies.\" In ancient times, the ministers of Xia and Shang turned against their enemies Jie and Zhou to serve Tang and Wu; the people of Susha attacked their own lord and submitted to Shennong. Thus it is said: \"What people fear, one cannot but fear.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"In governing the great, the Dao cannot be small; in vast lands, control cannot be narrow; in high positions, affairs cannot be burdensome; among many people, teachings cannot be harsh. Affairs burdensome are hard to govern; laws harsh are hard to enforce. Seeking much is hard to sustain. Measuring by inches to reach a *zhang* will surely err; weighing by *zhu* to reach a *dan* will surely exceed. The *dan* scale and *zhang* measure are direct and seldom err. Broad outlines are easy to grasp; intricate distinctions are hard to fathom. Thus, what harms governance and benefits disorder, the sage does not do; what harms utility and benefits waste, the wise do not practice.\n\nTherefore, in achievement, do not weary of simplicity; in affairs, do not weary of frugality; in seeking, do not weary of fewness. Simple achievements are easy to complete; frugal affairs are easy to govern; few seekings are easy to sustain. Entrusting to the multitude is easy. Thus, petty eloquence harms righteousness; petty righteousness breaks the Dao. A narrow Dao will not reach far; what reaches far must be simple. Rivers are winding yet can go far; mountains are sloping yet can be high; the Dao is leisurely yet can transform. One skilled in a single craft, versed in a single matter, or precise in a single ability can expound in detail but cannot respond broadly.\n\nIn tuning strings, small ones are tense and large ones relaxed. In establishing affairs, the lowly labor while the noble rest.\" The words of the Dao say: \"Vast and obscure, following heaven’s majesty, sharing its *qi*.\" Those who share *qi* are emperors; those who share righteousness are kings; those who share achievements are hegemons. Those who lack even one of these...\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who perish through these are thus: they do not speak yet are trusted, do not act yet are benevolent, do not rage yet are awe-inspiring—such is the movement of transformation by the heart of heaven. Those who act with benevolence, speak with trustworthiness, and rage with awe do so through the power of utmost sincerity. Those who act without benevolence, speak without trustworthiness, and rage without awe do so through mere outward appearance.\n\nThus, with the Dao, even few laws suffice for order; without the Dao, even many laws suffice for chaos. Laozi said: \"When the great fish loses water, it is controlled by ants; when the ruler abandons his proper role and contends with ministers over affairs, he is controlled by his officials.\" To hold position and guard duty through non-action is to govern by listening and compliance, allowing ministers to conceal their wisdom without employing it, only to monopolize affairs and dominate their sovereign.\n\nWhen the ruler does not appoint the capable but delights in acting himself, his wisdom becomes daily obstructed, and he bears responsibility alone. When his strategies are exhausted below, he cannot extend governance; when his conduct falters in office, he cannot maintain control. If his wisdom is insufficient for governance and his awe insufficient for punishment, he has nothing with which to engage the world.\n\nWhen joy and anger shape the heart and desires manifest outwardly, those who guard duty depart from rectitude to flatter superiors, and officials bend the law to follow the wind. When rewards do not match merit and punishments do not fit crimes, superiors and subordinates grow estranged, ruler and ministers resentful, the hundred offices disordered, and wisdom cannot resolve it. When praise and blame arise yet clarity cannot illuminate, the ruler, rather than acknowledging his own faults, instead blames himself—thus the sovereign grows ever more labored while ministers grow ever more idle.

He who establishes yet is controlled by others cannot hold the state. Thus, the skilled establisher cannot be uprooted—this speaks of establishing the formless.\n\nOnly the spiritually transformative cannot be overcome by things. When inner desires do not leak outward, it is called \"bolted\"; when external perversions do not enter, it is called \"shut.\" With inner bolted and outer shut, what affair is not moderated? With outer shut and inner bolted, what affair is not accomplished? Thus, non-use is not inaction, and non-doing is not idleness. Words are not boasted, affairs are not seized.

Before insects hibernated, fire was not used in the fields.

      "translated_text": "The heart thus readies the people of its own accord. Laozi said: In ancient times, enlightened rulers took from the people with restraint and maintained their own sustenance with measure. They necessarily calculated the year’s harvest and gauged the people’s stores, knowing the surplus and deficiency. Only then did they take their due. Thus, they received what was bestowed by Heaven and Earth, avoiding the calamity of hunger and cold. Their compassion for the people was such that if the state suffered famine, they did not indulge in rich flavors; if the people endured cold, they did not don fur in winter. Sharing in the people’s joys and sorrows, the realm knew no grieving subjects nor benighted rulers.\n\nOtherwise, they took from the people without sparing their strength, demanded without reckoning their stores. Men and women could not tend to their plows and looms, yet still supplied the demands above. Their strength exhausted, their wealth depleted, they had mornings but no evenings. Ruler and minister grew estranged.\n\nFor a person to live: one man plows with his foot, yet does not exceed ten *mu*. The yield of middling fields does not surpass four *shi*. Wife and children, the old and weak, depend on this for food. Should disaster strike, there would be nothing to meet the demands above—thus the lord would pity them.\n\nGreedy lords and violent rulers drain their people to satisfy boundless desires, and the hundred clans do not receive Heaven’s harmony nor tread Earth’s virtue.\n\nLaozi said: Of Heaven and Earth’s *qi*, none is greater than harmony. Harmony is the balance of yin and yang, the division of day and night. Thus, all things are born at the spring equinox and mature at the autumn equinox. Birth and maturation must attain the essence of harmony. Therefore, accumulated yin does not generate, accumulated yang does not transform. Only when yin and yang unite can harmony be achieved.\n\nThus, the sage’s Way is lenient yet firm, stern yet warm, yielding yet upright, fierce yet benevolent. Too rigid, it snaps; too pliant, it bends. The Way lies precisely between rigidity and pliability. The carpenter’s line may be coiled and stored, drawn out and extended—straight yet not rigid, long yet not overreaching, short yet not lacking. Thus, the sage embodies this.\n\nIf kindness is overemphasized, one becomes weak; weakness loses authority. If severity is overemphasized, one becomes harsh; harshness loses harmony. If love is overemphasized, one becomes indulgent; indulgence loses command. If punishment is overemphasized, one invites calamity; calamity loses kinship. Thus, harmony is prized.\n\nLaozi said: A state endures because it attains the Way; it perishes because its principles are obstructed. Therefore, the sage observes transformations to discern omens. Virtue waxes and wanes, and the wind foretells its sprouts. Those who grasp the Way of life, though small, must grow great. Those with signs of ruin, though established, must fail.\n\nA state’s demise does not lie in its size, nor does the Way’s flourishing depend on smallness. Thus, a disordered state’s ruler pursues vast lands but not benevolence and righteousness, seeks high position but not virtue and the Way—abandoning what sustains existence to create what brings ruin.\n\nIf above, the Three Luminaries’ brightness is disordered, and below, the myriad people’s hearts are lost, who can bear it? Thus, those who examine themselves need not prepare against others.\n\nIn ancient times, rulers who practiced deeply called it virtue and the Way; those who practiced shallowly called it benevolence and righteousness; those who practiced thinly called it ritual and wisdom. These six are the state’s guiding principles. Deep practice brings profound blessings; shallow practice brings meager blessings. Practicing all, the world submits.\n\nIn ancient times, cultivating virtue and the Way rectified the world; cultivating benevolence and righteousness rectified a state; cultivating ritual and wisdom rectified a village. Profound virtue is great; shallow virtue is small. Thus, position is not established by might, nor victory by unyielding strength, nor attainment by greed and contention. To stand in the world, extend the self; to conquer the world, submit the self; to gain the world, yield to it—not by seizing for oneself. Thus, the female and the yielding prevail. With benevolence and righteousness, one attains; without contention, none can contend.\n\nThe Way’s presence in the world is like the rivers and seas. The Way of Heaven: those who act spoil it; those who grasp lose it. Those who seek great renown and contend for it, I see them failing to attain it. Even if they grasp and obtain it, it does not endure.\n\nRenown cannot be sought and gained. In the world, yield to it, and the world will return to you. What the world returns to is virtue. Thus, the highest virtue, the world returns to; the highest benevolence, the realm returns to; the highest righteousness, the state returns to; the highest ritual, the village returns to. Without these four, the people do not return. Without return, using force is perilous.\n\nThus, the military is an inauspicious instrument, used only when unavoidable. Though victorious, do not praise it. Thus, it is called the realm of death, where thorns grow. Mourn it with sorrow, dwell in it with funeral rites. Therefore, the noble person pursues virtue and the Way, not prizing warfare.\n\nWenzi asked: Why are benevolence, righteousness, and ritual considered inferior to virtue and the Way?\n\nLaozi said: Those who practice benevolence must judge by sorrow and joy; those who practice righteousness must clarify by taking and giving. Within the four seas, sorrow and joy cannot be universal; the treasury’s wealth cannot suffice the myriad people. Thus, it is better to cultivate the Way and practice virtue, following Heaven and Earth’s nature. All things rectify themselves, and the world is provided for. Benevolence and righteousness are but adjuncts.\n\nThus, the great man dwells in profundity, not shallowness. Ritual is the ornament of substance; benevolence is the effect of kindness. Thus, ritual is based on human sentiment and does not exceed its substance. Benevolence does not overflow kindness. Grief embraces emotion; sending off the dead accords with benevolence. Nurturing life does not force what people cannot reach; it does not sever what they cannot abandon. Measuring oneself does not lose its balance. Without praise or blame, no cause arises.\n\nThus, music is made sufficient to unite joy, not exceeding harmony. It clarifies the distinction between life and death, comprehends the balance of extravagance and frugality.\n\nIn later ages, words contradict actions, emotions oppose appearances. Ritual becomes ornate and burdensome; music stirs licentious winds. Customs drown in worldliness; praise and blame gather in the court. Thus, the perfected person is discarded and unused.\n\nChasing a swift steed on foot, a person cannot outrun it; placing it in a chariot, the steed cannot outrun the person. Thus, those who skillfully employ the Way ride others’ resources to establish merit, entrusting what they can to what they cannot.\n\nThe ruler accords with the seasons, and the people repay with wealth. The ruler treats them with ritual, and the people repay with their lives. Thus, there are endangered states but no secure rulers; anxious lords but no joyful ministers.\n\nVirtue exceeding position brings honor; emolument exceeding virtue brings misfortune. Esteeming without virtue is usurpation; taking without righteousness is theft.\n\nThe sage is content in poverty, delights in the Way, does not harm life with desire, nor burden the self with profit. Thus, they do not violate righteousness to take recklessly.\n\nIn ancient times, none without virtue were honored, none without ability were employed, none without merit were rewarded, none without crime were punished. In advancing people...",

      "translated_text": "In dismissing people, employ ritual; in advancing people in an age of petty men, employ righteousness. In advancing people, be as lofty as the heavens; in dismissing them, be as deep as the abyss. The ancients acted with urgency, while today we falter. In selecting horses, one errs by favoring the lean; in choosing scholars, one errs by favoring the poor. A pig may grow fat to fill the kitchen, but its bones, though brittle, are not fit for office. The noble person examines substance and does not trust mere words. To conceal a ruler’s faults and not admonish him is not the way of a loyal minister. To admonish and not be heeded is a sign of an unenlightened ruler. To see the people drowning in suffering and not grieve is not the way of a worthy lord.\n\nThus, to uphold integrity and die for righteousness is the duty of a minister. To clothe the cold and feed the hungry is the kindness of a compassionate father. To serve the great by means of the small is called \"transforming others\"; to offend the great by means of the small is called \"defying Heaven.\" Though one may ascend to the heavens at first, one will surely plunge into the abyss. Therefore, in villages and hamlets, elders are honored by age; in the court, ranks are distinguished by nobility. Those who are exalted are so because they draw near to the ruler; those who honor the aged do so because they draw near to their kin; those who respect their elders do so because they draw near to their elder brothers.\n\nThose born to nobility grow arrogant; those born to wealth grow extravagant. Thus, few among the rich and noble, if they do not illumine the Way and examine themselves, can avoid wrongdoing. To learn without weariness is how one cultivates the self; to teach without fatigue is how one governs the people. Few who abandon worthy teachers and good friends will not fall into wrongdoing. To recognize worthiness is called wisdom; to love worthiness is called benevolence; to honor worthiness is called righteousness; to revere worthiness is called ritual; to delight in worthiness is called music.\n\nThe ancients who were good at governing the world acted without acting, yet nothing was left undone. Thus, in governing the world, if one has capacity, one attains it; if one acts without acting, one achieves merit. Without capacity, every action invites misfortune. One who has capacity in governing the world is cautious, as if crossing a great river in winter; hesitant, as if fearing the four neighbors; solemn, as if a guest; melting, as if ice dissolving; simple, as if uncarved wood; turbid, as if muddy water; vast, as if a valley.\n\nThis is the capacity of one who governs the world: to be cautious as if crossing a great river in winter is to dare not act; to be hesitant as if fearing the four neighbors is to fear self-injury; to be solemn as if a guest is to be humble and reverent; to melt as if ice dissolving is to dare not hoard; to be simple as if uncarved wood is to dare not claim completion; to be turbid as if muddy water is to dare not seek clarity; to be vast as if a valley is to dare not seek fullness.\n\nTo dare not act in advancing is to dare not take the lead in retreating. To fear self-injury is to guard softness and weakness and dare not be proud. To be humble and reverent is to lower oneself and respect others. To dare not hoard is to diminish oneself and dare not be rigid. To dare not claim completion is to humble oneself and dare not be whole. To dare not seek clarity is to dwell in turbidity and disgrace and dare not be fresh. To dare not seek fullness is to see insufficiency and dare not consider oneself worthy.\n\nThus, the Dao retreats and so can advance; it guards softness and so can be strong; it lowers itself and so can be exalted; it diminishes itself and so can be full; it dwells in disgrace and so can be renewed; it sees insufficiency and so can be worthy. The Dao acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone.\n\n**On Righteousness**\nLaozi said: In all learning, one who can clarify the distinction between Heaven and humanity, comprehend the root of order and chaos, purify the mind and clarify the intent to preserve it, perceive its beginning and end, and return to emptiness and nothingness may be called enlightened.\n\nThe root of governance is benevolence and righteousness; its branches are laws and regulations. What gives rise to humanity is the root; what does not give rise to it is the branch. Root and branch are one, yet their natures differ in what they cherish. To put the root first and the branch second is the way of the noble person; to put the branch first and the root second is the way of the petty man.\n\nLaws arise to assist righteousness. To value laws and abandon righteousness is like prizing one’s hat and shoes while forgetting one’s head and feet. Benevolence and righteousness are vast and lofty. To diminish their depth while expanding their breadth is to invite ruin. To not broaden the foundation while increasing the height is to invite collapse. Thus, without a great ridgepole, one cannot bear heavy burdens. Nothing bears the weight of the state like virtue. For a ruler to possess the people is like a city possessing its foundation or a tree possessing its roots. When roots run deep, the trunk is firm; when the foundation is thick, the heights are secure.\n\nThus, affairs not rooted in the Dao and virtue cannot serve as enduring principles. Words not aligned with the former kings cannot serve as the Way. To seize upon and adopt a single deed or merit as a technique is not the universal Way of the world.\n\nLaozi said: The way of governing people is like Zaofu driving a team of four horses—aligning them with reins and bits, regulating them with the chest and breast, inwardly attaining the center of the heart, outwardly harmonizing with the horses’ will. Thus, one can traverse the Way and reach distant places, with strength to spare, advancing and retreating, turning and curving, all as one desires. Truly, one has mastered the technique.\n\nNow, power and authority are the ruler’s chariot; great ministers are the ruler’s team of four horses. The body cannot depart from the comfort of the chariot; the hand cannot lose the hearts of the horses. If the team is not in harmony, even Zaofu cannot traverse the Way. If ruler and ministers are not in accord, even a sage cannot bring about good governance.\n\nGrasp the Dao to guide them, and even those of middling talent can fully understand their duties. Demonstrate the proper divisions, and treachery and deceit can be halted. Observe changes as things arise; respond to transformations as affairs come. If those near are not in chaos, those far will be governed. Without relying on arbitrary teachings, one attains the natural Dao, and in ten thousand actions, nothing is lost.\n\nLaozi said: In all matters of the Dao, block the paths of deceit and guard against what has not yet arisen. Do not value self-righteousness; value the inability to do wrong. Thus it is said: Do not allow what can be desired, lest there be daily seeking; do not allow what can be seized, lest there be daily contention. If this is so, human desires will recede, and the public Way will prevail.\n\nLet those with surplus halt at the proper measure; let those with insufficiency reach what they need. Thus, the world can be unified. If one abandons duties to heed praise and blame, discards merit to employ cliques, then rare talents will long remain in their posts without advancement, and the customs of the people will be corrupted in the state while meritorious ministers contend in the court. Thus, one who possesses the Dao can govern others; one who lacks the Dao is governed by others.\n\nLaozi said: In governing the state, there is a constant, and that is to benefit the people as the root. In administering teachings, there is a Way, and that is to ensure commands are carried out. If it benefits the people, one need not follow antiquity; if it suits the affairs at hand, one need not adhere to custom. Thus, the sage adapts laws to the times and rituals to customs. Clothing, utensils, and tools each serve their use; laws, regulations, and commands each suit their purpose. Therefore, to change antiquity is not necessarily wrong, nor is following custom necessarily praiseworthy.\n\nReciting the books of the former kings is not as good as hearing their words; hearing their words is not as good as grasping the meaning behind them. One who grasps the meaning behind their words finds that words cannot express it. Thus, the Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao; the name that can be named is not the constant name.

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: Does the world possess any constant laws? When one aligns with the affairs of the age, accords with human principles, harmonizes with Heaven and Earth, and attends to the spirits, then one may rightly govern. In ancient times, the Three Sovereigns had no decrees, yet the people followed; the Five Emperors had decrees but no punishments. The Xia dynasty did not break its word, the Yin people swore oaths, and the Zhou people made covenants—yet in the decline of later ages, men endured disgrace and slighted shame, coveted gain and lacked modesty. Thus, laws and decrees are framed in consideration of the people’s customs and tempered to their urgency; implements are fashioned in response to the times and suited to their use. Those bound by laws cannot grasp the broader vision; those constrained by ritual cannot respond to change. Only one with unique insight and singular discernment can then master the Dao and act accordingly.\n\nThose who know the origin of laws adapt to the times; those who do not know the source of governance, though they follow precedent, will ultimately bring chaos. Today’s scholars follow the ancients, inherit their practices, cling to texts, and uphold written laws, seeking thereby to govern—yet without this, they deem governance impossible. It is like forcing a square tenon into a round mortise. To achieve fitness and suitability is thus difficult indeed.\n\nTo preserve the precarious and govern the chaotic, none but the wise are capable. To extol antiquity, even fools can do in excess. Thus, the sage does not employ unused laws; the enlightened ruler does not heed unverified words.\n\nWenzi asked: From whence do laws arise?\nLaozi replied: Laws arise from righteousness; righteousness arises from what suits the multitude. When what suits the multitude aligns with the human heart, this is the essence of governance. Laws do not descend from Heaven, nor do they emerge from the Earth.",

      "translated_text": "The Way arises from the human realm yet returns to rectify the self. When sincerity reaches its root, the branches do not disorder; when one knows the essential, doubts do not confuse. What one possesses, one does not condemn in others; what one lacks, one does not demand of them. What is established below is not abolished above; what is forbidden among the people is not practiced by oneself. Thus, when the ruler enacts laws, he first applies them to himself as a model. When prohibitions prevail over his own person, his commands are obeyed by the people.\n\nFor the law is the plumb line of the world, the ruler’s measure. To suspend the law is to render law lawless. Once the law is fixed, those who meet its line are rewarded; those who fall short are punished. Though noble and exalted, none receive light rewards; though lowly and base, none suffer heavy punishments. Those who violate the law, though worthy, are surely executed; those who meet the measure, though unworthy, incur no guilt. Thus, the public Way is followed, and private desires are blocked.\n\nThe ancients established officials to restrain the people from wantonness, and set up rulers to control the officials from acting arbitrarily. Laws, measures, the Dao, and arts exist to restrain the ruler from reckless decisions. When none can act wantonly, the Dao prevails and order is achieved.\n\nThus, returning to simplicity and practicing non-action—non-action does not mean inaction, but that all proceeds from the self.\n\nLaozi said: The skilled in reward spend little yet encourage much; the skilled in punishment use few penalties yet suppress transgressions. The skilled in bestowing employ restraint yet confer virtue; the skilled in taking receive much yet incur no resentment. Thus, the sage follows what the people favor to encourage goodness, and follows what they detest to prohibit wrongdoing. Reward one, and the world rushes to follow; punish one, and the world stands in awe. Therefore, the utmost reward costs nothing, the utmost punishment is not excessive. The sage governs broadly by holding to restraint—this is what is meant.\n\nLaozi said: The Way of the minister is to discuss rightness, determine what should be done, take the lead in tasks, uphold duties, clarify roles, and establish success. When ruler and minister follow different paths, governance is achieved; when they share the same path, chaos ensues. Each attaining their proper place, acting as they should—then above and below have means to employ one another.\n\nThus, branches must not exceed the trunk, nor the tip surpass the root. Words of weight and measure, great and small, serve to restrain one another. He who gains authority wields little yet profits greatly, holds little yet controls broadly. A tree ten spans around supports a house of a thousand jun—it attains its position of advantage. A bolt five inches long can govern opening and closing—it occupies a critical point. Commands issued below must be executed: those who comply gain benefit, those who resist meet misfortune. The world obeys none but those who follow the Way.\n\nProclamations are issued and prohibitions enforced by relying on the power of the multitude. Righteousness does not seek to benefit all the people of the world, yet benefiting one leads the world to follow. Tyranny does not seek to harm all within the seas, yet harming one causes the world to rebel. Thus, actions taken and measures set must be carefully considered.\n\nLaozi said: Yield an inch to extend a foot; bend slightly to achieve great straightness. The sage acts thus. A hundred streams flow together, yet those not pouring into the sea are not valleys. Those who pursue divergent paths yet do not return to goodness are not gentlemen. Good words are valued for their practicability; good deeds, for their benevolence and righteousness.\n\nThe faults of a gentleman are like the eclipses of the sun and moon—they do not harm their brilliance. Thus, the wise do not act recklessly; the brave do not kill without cause. They choose what is right and act accordingly, calculate propriety and proceed—thus their affairs succeed and their achievements endure, their names are praised even after death.\n\nThough possessing wisdom and ability, they must take benevolence and righteousness as their foundation before establishing themselves. Wisdom and ability proceed together; the sage unifies them with benevolence and righteousness as the plumb line. Those who meet the line are called gentlemen; those who do not are called petty men. Though a gentleman may perish, his name is not extinguished; though a petty man may gain power, his guilt is not erased.\n\nTo grasp the map of the world in the left hand and sever one’s throat with the right—even a fool would not do this, for the body is valued above the world. To face death in defending one’s ruler or parents is to regard death as a return home, for righteousness is weightier than the self. Thus, the greatest benefit to the world is great; compared to the self, it is small. What the self holds dear, compared to benevolence and righteousness, is light. This is to take benevolence and righteousness as the plumb line.\n\nLaozi said: The completeness of virtue and the Dao is like the sun and moon. Barbarians and distant tribes cannot alter their course. Intentions and actions aligned—praise or blame lie in custom; conduct uniform—success or failure lie in timing. Adapting to the world, achievements are accomplished; aligning with the times, names are established. Thus, those who establish merit and fame simplify their dealings with the world and attend closely to the times. When the moment arrives, not even a breath can be spared.\n\nThe ancients used troops not to covet land or plunder treasures, but to preserve the perishing, pacify disorder, and relieve the people of harm.",

      "translated_text": "The greedy and avaricious, those of excessive desire, ravage the world and harm its people, stirring unrest so none find peace in their possessions. The sage arises resolutely to punish the violent, pacify chaos, and rid the world of harm—turning turbidity to clarity, peril to tranquility. Thus, there is no choice but to sever the Red Emperor, for he brought the scourge of fire; thus, the Yellow Emperor captured him. Gonggong wrought the calamity of water, so Zhuanxu executed him. They instructed the people in the Dao, guided them with virtue, yet if they would not heed, they confronted them with might. If might failed to compel obedience, they subdued them with arms. To kill the innocent and sustain an unjust lord—what greater harm could there be? To amass the world’s wealth to sate one man’s desires—what deeper disaster could there be? To indulge one man’s cravings and prolong suffering across the land—this is what the bonds of heaven reject.\n\nThe purpose of establishing a ruler is to suppress violence and disorder. Now, if one rides the strength of the people only to ravage them, this is like gifting wings to a tiger—how can such a thing not be eradicated? He who rears fish must remove otters and eels; he who tends beasts must eliminate jackals and wolves—how much more so for one who shepherds the people? Thus arises the necessity of arms.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of governing a state is this—above, no oppressive decrees; among officials, no onerous governance; among scholars, no deceitful conduct; among artisans, no frivolous craft. Their affairs proceed without disturbance, their tools remain whole without adornment. In times of chaos, it is otherwise: those who act vie to outdo one another in loftiness; those who observe ritual vie in ostentation. Chariots and carriages reach extremes of carving, implements descend into intricate engraving. Those who seek goods contend over what is hard to obtain, prizing it as treasure; those who disparage refinement chase after complexity, deeming it urgent. Scholars engage in cunning debate, prolonging disputes without resolution, bringing no benefit to order but only to disorder. Artisans craft strange devices, taking years to complete them, yet they serve no practical use.\n\nThus, the laws of Shennong state: If able-bodied men do not till the soil, the world will suffer hunger; if women in their prime do not weave, the world will endure cold. Therefore, he himself plowed the fields, his wife herself wove cloth, setting the example for all under heaven. He did not prize goods hard to obtain nor esteem things of no use. Thus, if the plowman does not exert himself, he cannot sustain life; if the weaver does not labor, she cannot clothe the body. Surplus and deficiency each return to the self. When clothing and food abound, deceit and wickedness do not arise; in peace and ease, without strife, the world attains harmony. The wise have no need to deploy their defenses, the brave no occasion to display their might.\n\nLaozi said: The Dao of hegemons and kings relies on planning and foresight, on prevention and strategy. They act while grasping righteousness—not to secure their own survival, but to preserve the perishing. Thus, when they hear of a ruler in a neighboring state who tyrannizes his people, they raise arms and advance to his borders, reproaching him for his injustice and rebuking him for his transgressions. When their troops reach his outskirts, the commanders issue orders: \"Do not fell trees, do not desecrate graves, do not ruin the five grains, do not burn stored provisions, do not seize the people as captives, do not gather their livestock.\" Then they proclaim: \"The ruler of this state defies heaven and earth, insults the spirits, metes out judgments unjustly, slaughters the innocent—he is one whom heaven condemns and the people revile. Our army has come to depose the unrighteous and invest the virtuous. Whoever dares oppose the Dao of heaven and disturb the people as a brigand shall perish with his clan. Those households that heed our call shall be rewarded with households; those villages that comply shall be rewarded with villages; those towns that submit shall be enfeoffed with towns; those counties that yield shall be granted as marquisates. If we conquer the state, we shall not harm its people. We shall depose its ruler, reform its governance, honor its outstanding scholars, elevate its worthy and good, succor its orphans and widows, relieve its poor and destitute, release its prisoners, and reward its meritorious. The people will open their doors to welcome us, store their provisions for us, fearing only that we will not come.\"\n\nRighteous arms, upon reaching the border, halt without battle; unrighteous arms, upon arrival, meet corpses and flowing blood in mutual slaughter. Thus, those who fight for land cannot achieve kingship; those who seek for themselves cannot establish merit. Those who act for others gain the support of the many; those who act for themselves are abandoned by the many. Where the many move, even the weak become strong; where the many depart, even the great perish.\n\nLaozi said: The highest virtue governs the state, orders the realm, practices benevolence and righteousness, spreads virtue and bestows kindness, establishes just laws, and blocks the path of evil. Ministers draw near, the people harmonize, above and below unite as one, ministers join forces, feudal lords submit to might, and the four directions cherish virtue. Rectifying the court, they repel threats a thousand *li* away; issuing commands, the world responds in unison—this is the highest achievement. When the land is vast, the people numerous, the ruler worthy, the generals capable, the state wealthy, and the army strong, with discipline firm and orders clear, two evenly matched foes may never engage in battle before the enemy flees—this is the next best. Knowing the suitability of the land, mastering the advantages of perilous terrain, discerning the shifts of harsh governance, and examining the affairs of battle formations—when blades clash and arrows fly like rain, the dead and wounded fill the land, blood flows for a thousand *li*, and bones lie exposed across the fields—this is the lowest of righteousness.\n\nThe outcome of war lies in governance. When governance prevails and the people submit to their superiors, the army is strong and the people victorious. When governance fails and the people rebel against their superiors, the army is weak. Righteousness suffices to embrace the people of the world; deeds suffice to meet the world’s crises; selection and appointment suffice to win the hearts of the worthy; planning and deliberation suffice to decide matters of weight—this is the Dao of the highest virtue.\n\nLaozi said: The reason a state becomes strong is its people’s willingness to die. The reason they are willing to die is righteousness. The reason righteousness prevails is might. Thus, govern with civility and align with martial power—this is called certain victory. Might and righteousness advance together—this is called certain strength. When blades cross and arrows fall like rain, yet soldiers vie to advance, it is because rewards are certain and punishments clear. If the ruler regards his subjects as sons, they will serve him as fathers—he will rule the four seas. If subjects serve their ruler as fathers, they will govern the world. If the ruler regards his subjects as younger brothers, they will be willing to die for him. If subjects serve their ruler as elder brothers, they will be willing to perish for him. Thus, one cannot contend with enemies bound as father and son, brothers. Therefore, a righteous ruler internally cultivates governance to accumulate virtue, externally blocks evil to clarify his power, examines the toil and ease of his people to know their hunger and satiety. When the day of battle arrives, they face death as if returning home. The grace bestowed upon them is supreme.\n\nLaozi said: In high antiquity, the True Person breathed in harmony with yin and yang, and all living things looked up to their virtue, attaining harmony and compliance. In that time, governance was subtle and hidden, naturally forming purity and simplicity. Before purity and simplicity dispersed, the myriad things flourished in abundance. As the age declined...",

      "translated_text": "When it reached the era of Fuxi, the world was dim and murky, yet all sought to cast off their childlike simplicity and awaken to the realm between Heaven and Earth. Their virtue grew tangled and inconsistent. By the time of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor, they meticulously ordered the world’s principles, aligning the four seasons and harmonizing yin and yang. Thus, the myriad people stood in reverence, yearning to support and obey, listening and observing. Yet governance, though orderly, lacked harmony.\n\nDescending to the Xia and Yin dynasties, desires extended to external things, and keen perception was lured outward. Nature and destiny lost their authenticity. When it came to the Zhou, purity thinned and simplicity scattered. The Dao was abandoned in favor of artifice; frugality in virtue became a mere act. Cunning and skill sprouted, and crafty learning imitated the sages. Ornate falsehoods coerced the masses. Poetry and books were polished and adorned to trade for fame and reputation.

      "translated_text": "The principle of honor and disgrace is such that even if the whole world praises it, it does not increase encouragement; even if the whole world condemns it, it does not add to discouragement—this is the essence of attaining the great Dao. Laozi said: In ancient times, rulers wore their hair loose and without collars to govern the world. Their virtue gave life without killing, bestowed without seizing. The world did not share their attire but embraced their virtue. In that era, yin and yang were harmonious, and the myriad things flourished. The nests of flying birds could be reached and examined by bending down; wild beasts could be leashed and followed.\n\nWhen decline set in, birds, beasts, insects, and snakes all became harms to the people. Thus, iron was cast and blades forged to defend against these calamities. When people were pressed by hardship, they sought convenience; when afflicted by disaster, they prepared defenses. Each used their wit to avoid harm and pursue benefit, always deviating from constancy and unable to follow precedent. Tools and weapons could not remain unchanged, so the laws and standards of former kings were subject to alteration. Thus it is said: \"A name that can be named is not the constant name.\"\n\nThe Five Emperors followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; the Three Kings pursued distinct affairs yet their names endured through later generations. They changed with the times, like the tuning of the five notes by the master musician Shi Kuang. Though the shifts rise and fall without constancy, measuring by the foot and inch, none miss the mark. Thus, one who understands the essence of music can create sound; one who has a fundamental principle within and knows the use of compass and square can govern people. Therefore, the systems of former kings should not be immediately abolished; the affairs of the latter age, if good, should be recorded. Thus, the sage who establishes rites and music does not create them for rites and music alone; the one who regulates things does not do so for things alone; the one who establishes laws does not do so for laws alone. Hence it is said: \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.\"\n\nLaozi said: The sage kings of old took symbols from heaven above, measures from earth below, and models from humanity between. They harmonized the qi of yin and yang, balanced the seasons’ nodes, and examined the suitability of hills, plains, waters, and marshes—whether fertile or barren, high or low—to establish affairs, generate wealth, eliminate the suffering of hunger and cold, and ward off the disasters of illness and plague. They received human affairs at their center to create rites and music, practiced the Dao of benevolence and righteousness to govern human relationships, and distinguished the natures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to establish the intimacy of father and son and form the family. They listened to the clear and turbid of the five notes and the mutual generation of the six pitch-standards to establish the righteousness of ruler and minister and form the state. They observed the sequence of the four seasons—first, middle, and last—to establish the order of elder and younger and form the bureaucracy. They divided the land into provinces and governed the state through districts, establishing universities to educate. These were the guiding principles of governance.\n\nAttaining the Dao leads to flourishing; losing it leads to decline. No thing has ever been stretched without relaxation or prospered without decay. Only the sage can prosper without decay. When the sage first created music, it was to return the spirit to the altar, curb excess, and restore the heavenly heart. When it declined, it flowed without return, became licentious and enamored of beauty, disregarding proper laws, and spread to later generations until it led to the ruin of states.\n\nWhen the sage first created writing, it was to govern and order the hundred affairs. The foolish used it to avoid forgetting; the wise used it to record events. When it declined, it was employed for deceit and falsehood to absolve the guilty and kill the innocent.\n\nWhen the sage first created parks, it was to prepare offerings for ancestral temples and train soldiers to guard against unforeseen events. When it declined, they galloped and hunted, seizing the people’s time and exhausting their strength.\n\nWhen the sage first honored worthies, it was to level education, rectify lawsuits, place the worthy in office, and employ the capable. Grace flowed downward, and the myriad people cherished virtue. When it declined, cliques formed, each promoting their own, abandoning the public for private interests. Inside and outside, they recommended one another; the wicked held office while the worthy withdrew. The Dao of heaven and earth reaches its extreme and then returns; it gains and then loses. Thus, the sage governs corruption by reforming systems, ends one affair and begins another. Its beauty lies in harmony; its flaw lies in power.\n\nThe Dao of the sage says: Without cultivating rites, righteousness, integrity, and shame, the people cannot be governed. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot rectify. Without exalting the good and abolishing the ugly, there is no turn toward rites and righteousness. Without laws, there can be no governance. Without knowing rites and righteousness, laws cannot be implemented. Laws can kill the unfilial but cannot make people filial; they can punish thieves but cannot make people honest.\n\nWhen the sage king is above, he clarifies likes and dislikes to show the people, uses constant praise and blame to guide them, promotes the worthy and advances them, despises the unworthy and demotes them. Punishments are set aside and unused; rites and righteousness are cultivated, and the virtuous are employed. Thus, the highest in the world become the Three Dukes; the highest in a province become the Nine Ministers; the highest in a state become the Twenty-Seven Grand Masters; the highest in a village become the Eighty-One Primary Officers. Those whose wisdom surpasses ten thousand are called heroes; a thousand, called talents; a hundred, called杰; ten, called豪.\n\nOne who understands the Dao of heaven and earth, comprehends the principles of human emotions, is vast enough to embrace the multitude, benevolent enough to cherish the distant, wise enough to know power—this is a hero. One whose virtue is sufficient to teach and transform, whose conduct is sufficient to conceal righteousness, whose trustworthiness is sufficient to gain the people, whose clarity is sufficient to illuminate below—this is a talent. One whose conduct can serve as a model, whose wisdom is sufficient to resolve doubts, whose trustworthiness can keep promises, whose integrity can distribute wealth, whose actions can be emulated, whose words can be followed—this is a杰. One who guards their office without neglect, stands by righteousness without cliques, faces danger without careless escape, and sees profit without careless gain—this is a豪.\n\nHeroes, talents,杰, and豪 each occupy their positions according to the magnitude of their abilities. From root to branch, from heavy to light, the superior initiates and the inferior harmonizes. Within the four seas, all are of one heart, turning from greed and baseness toward benevolence and righteousness. Their transformation of the people is like the wind bending grass.\n\nNow, if the unworthy oversee the worthy, even with severe punishments, they cannot suppress their treachery. The small cannot control the great; the weak cannot command the strong—this is the nature of heaven and earth. Thus, the sage promotes the worthy to establish merit. The unworthy ruler promotes those he favors. Observing whom they promote reveals the distinction between order and chaos. Examining their cliques reveals whether they are worthy or unworthy.\n\nLaozi said: Those who create rites carve and polish human nature, distorting its true feelings. Though the eyes desire, they are restrained by measure; though the heart delights, they are moderated by rites. They pace and circle, bow and humble themselves, kneel and stiffen without eating, clarify wine without drinking. Outwardly, they bind their form; inwardly, they distress their virtue, restraining the harmony of yin and yang and oppressing the true feelings of life and destiny. Thus, they spend their lives in sorrow. Why? They do not address the root of desire but prohibit what is desired; they do not trace the origin of joy but block what brings joy. This is like penning beasts without sealing the fence, restraining their wild hearts, or damming the flow of rivers with one’s hands. Thus it is said: \"Open its aperture, assist its affairs, and it will be incurable for a lifetime.\"\n\nRites suppress emotions and close off desires, using righteousness to guard the self. Though the heart is choked and the form and nature starve and thirst, they force themselves with reluctance. Thus, none can complete their natural lifespan. Rites cannot make people cease desiring.",

      "translated_text": "Yet those who would restrain joy cannot make people cease rejoicing but only block its expression. To make the world fear punishment and refrain from theft—how is this better than eradicating the very thought of theft? Thus, one who knows there is no use for a thing, though greedy, will renounce it; one who does not know its use, though upright, cannot refuse it. The downfall of states, the death of rulers at the hands of men, the scorn of the world—were these not all born of desire? Like a fan in winter or a fur in summer, when a thing serves no purpose, the myriad things crumble to dust.\n\nThus, to ladle boiling water to halt its bubbling only makes it boil more fiercely. One who knows the root removes the fire and nothing more. Laozi said: \"To follow one’s nature in action is called the Dao; to attain one’s heavenly nature is called virtue. When nature is lost, then one values benevolence and righteousness. When benevolence and righteousness are established, the Dao and virtue are abandoned. Pure simplicity scatters, and rites and music adorn. Disputes arise, and the people vie for pearls and jade.\" Rites serve to distinguish the noble from the base, righteousness to harmonize the relations of ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife—the boundaries of human conduct. In the degenerate age, rites become hollow courtesy, and righteousness, mere exchange; generosity secures alliances, but ministers turn against rulers, and those not of the same flesh breed resentment.\n\nThus, where water pools, creatures that devour one another arise; where earth piles, beasts that feed on their own kind emerge. Where rites and music adorn, deceit and falsehood flourish. The governance of the degenerate age does not accumulate the means of nurturing life but dilutes the world’s purity, scatters its simplicity, and confounds the people. It takes clarity for turbidity, disrupts the flight of life and destiny, and turns integrity into chaos. People lose their nature, law and righteousness oppose each other, conduct and profit run counter. The gap between rich and poor widens, and the distinction between ruler and slave becomes negligible. When there is surplus, people yield; when there is scarcity, they contend. Yielding gives rise to rites and righteousness; contention breeds violence and disorder. Thus, with many desires, affairs become unmanageable; with insatiable demands, strife never ceases.\n\nIn an orderly age, petty men uphold rectitude, and profit cannot seduce them. In a chaotic age, even gentlemen turn to treachery, and the law cannot restrain them. Laozi said: \"The rulers of a declining age bore into mountains and rocks to extract gold and jade, smelt seashells and bronze, yet the myriad things do not flourish. They rip open wombs, burn the wilds, overturn nests, and destroy eggs. The phoenix does not soar, the qilin does not roam. They build towers of timber, burn forests for the hunt, drain marshes to fish, pile earth into mounds, dig wells to drink, dredge rivers to make pools, and fortify walls for defense. They cage beasts as livestock, and thus yin and yang are thrown into chaos, the four seasons lose their order. Thunder and lightning shatter, hail and frost bring harm. The myriad things wither and perish in great numbers; grasses and trees wither in summer. The Three Rivers run dry, mountains and streams are divided into boundaries, populations are tallied and apportioned. They devise traps and barriers, establish ranks and colors to mark noble and base, reward the worthy and punish the unworthy. Then arms rise, and strife is born; the innocent are slaughtered, the guiltless are punished.\n\nLaozi said: \"When the world is about to lose its nature, it is as if a dark vapor has arisen. The ruler is benighted and unclear, the Dao is abandoned and not practiced, virtue perishes and is not upheld. Affairs run counter to heaven, decrees defy the four seasons. Spring and autumn contract their harmony, heaven and earth strip away their virtue. The ruler occupies his position yet finds no peace; ministers retreat and remain silent. Officials anticipate the ruler’s will and disrupt constancy, alienate kin and secure their own position. Flatterers scheme in secret, swiftly corrupting the arrogant ruler, mirroring the chaos of the people to advance their ends. Thus, ruler and minister grow estranged, kin drift apart. Fields yield no standing grain, roads know no leisurely steps. Gold piles up but loses its edge, jade is hoarded yet cracks. Tortoise shells lie hollow, milfoil stalks are stripped bare. Divination is practiced daily, yet the world remains divided. Each feudal lord enacts his own laws, customs clash, roots are uprooted, and the fundamental is discarded. The five punishments are carved into sharpness, and men contend over the tip of an awl. They slaughter the people, cutting down more than half. Armies rise to wage war, besieging cities with indiscriminate killing. They scale high walls, secure perilous passes, deploy siege engines, and array battle formations. Soldiers die on the roads, charging fierce enemies. For every hundred who go forth, one returns. Reputations are falsely aggrandized, states are annexed, lands are seized. Corpses number in the hundreds of thousands, the old and weak perish from hunger and cold—countless. From this time onward, the world never regains the peace of its nature or the joy of its customs.\n\nThen the worthy and sagely arise in great numbers, upholding the Dao and virtue, aided by benevolence and righteousness. The near are advanced by wisdom, the far are embraced by virtue. The world is united as one, and generations succeed one another. They suppress the roots of flattery, silence the arguments of sophistry, abolish harsh laws, and remove vexatious affairs. They banish the traces of slander, block the gates of faction, and dissolve cunning and ability. Following the great constancy, they cast aside the limbs, discard cleverness, and unify the barriers. The myriad things each return to their root. The sage does not create the times but seizes them when they come, never missing the mean. Thus, the Dao is not severed midway.\n\nLaozi said: \"The depth of the Feng River is ten *ren*, yet it does not receive dust or filth. Gold and stone lie within, their forms visible without—not because it is not deep and clear, but because fish, turtles, and dragons do not gather there. No five grains grow on stony ground, no elk or deer roam barren hills—there is nothing to shelter or conceal. Thus, in governance, to take severity for discernment, sharpness for clarity, harshness for loyalty, and calculation for merit—this is like stretching leather: the path to great defeat and rupture. Such governance is murky, and the people are simple; it is exacting, and the people are flawed.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Govern the state with uprightness, employ the army with cunning. First establish an invincible defense, then seek victory over the enemy. To attack another’s chaos with one’s own disorder is like meeting fire with fire or water with water—neither can overcome the other. Thus, the extraordinary lies in difference: stillness overcomes restlessness, order overcomes chaos, satiety overcomes hunger, ease overcomes toil. The interplay of the extraordinary and the upright is like the mutual conquest of water, fire, metal, and wood—wherever it turns, it prevails. Thus, when virtue is equal, the numerous overcome the few; when strength is matched, the wise overcome the foolish; when wisdom is equal, those with strategy overcome those without. This is the *Wenzi*, Scroll the Lower.\"",
