One fascicle.\n*Source text:* *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongxuan Section*, *Registers and Records Category*.\n\n**The Text on the Three Masters’ Names, Styles, Appearances, Abodes, and Locations of the Dongxuan Lingbao Tradition**\n\nWanfu states: The scriptures say, *\"Without a master, one cannot be delivered.\"* They also say, *\"First visualize the Three Masters, then practice the Dao.\"* In all matters—whether reciting scriptures, lecturing, chanting, performing rituals, burning incense, entering chambers, or ascending altars—one must first pay homage to the master and visualize them, then make vows to deliver both one’s nine generations of ancestors and oneself. Without adhering to this method, the true numinous beings will not descend. To pay homage to the master, one must know their location; to visualize them, one must clearly recognize their appearance. At the time of receiving the Dao, the master should instruct accordingly. Thus, from the *Zhengyi* tradition upward to the *Dongzhen*, the names, styles, appearances, abodes, and locations of the Three Masters for each ordination are recorded as follows.\n\n---\n\n**1. Zhengyi Master**\n[The disciple’s] name and style: In the reign of [so-and-so] of [such-and-such] state, in the year of [Tai Sui’s] [such-and-such] cyclical sign, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, [so-and-so], a male/female official of [such-and-such] rank, aged [so-many] years, from [such-and-such] village in [such-and-such] county of [such-and-such] prefecture, received the *Zhengyi Mengwei* Register at the oratory of [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] village.\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters are as follows:\n- **Initiation Master (Dushi):** From the oratory of [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] village; a male/female official practicing qi-regulation, named [so-and-so], aged [so-many] years, with [such-and-such] appearance.\n- **Register Master (Jishi):** [Same format as above.]\n- **Scripture Master (Jingshi):** [Same format as above.]\n\n**Guarantor and Preceptor:** Guaranteed by [so-and-so], a male/female official practicing qi-regulation.\n\n[The following five persons follow the same format as above.]\n\n---\n\n**2. Master of the Five Thousand Characters**\n[The disciple’s] name and style: In the reign of [so-and-so] of [such-and-such] state, in the year of [Tai Sui’s] [such-and-such] cyclical sign, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, [so-and-so], a male/female disciple, aged [so-many] years, styled [so-and-so], from [such-and-such] village in [such-and-such] county of [such-and-such] prefecture, received the *Daode Wuqian Wen* and the *Three Grades of Essential Precepts* at the oratory, mountain retreat, or dwelling in [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county.\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters are as follows:\n- **Initiation Master:** From [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] village; a male/female Daoist master, surnamed [so-and-so], named [so-and-so], aged [so-many] years, styled [so-and-so].\n- **Register Master:** [Same format as above.]\n- **Scripture Master:** From [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, [such-and-such] village; a male/female Daoist master, surnamed [so-and-so], named [so-and-so], aged [so-many] years, styled [so-and-so].\n\n---\n\n**Ranks of Ordination Officials:**\n1. **Three Masters (Three Persons):** Called *Fashi* (Dharma Masters).\n2. **Five Guarantors (Five Persons):** Called *Dujang* (Chief Lecturers).\n3. **Six Illuminators (Six Persons):** Called *Jianji* (Supervisors of Salvation).\n4. **Seven Witnesses (Seven Persons):** Called *Shijing* (Scripture Attendants).\n5. **Eight Initiators (Eight Persons):** Called *Shixiang* (Incense Attendants).\n6. **Nine Perfected (Nine Persons):** Called *Shideng* (Lamp Attendants).\n\nThe above six ranks, totaling thirty-eight persons, consist of the master’s fellow students, those of high virtue, close associates, or spiritually advanced disciples and outstanding talents. They jointly sign the document, mutually encouraging one another, and are revered as teachers, styled *Zunren* (Venerable Ones). They present the ritual towel and knife to symbolize wiping away dust and filth, severing entanglements, unraveling the net of afflictions, and breaking through the web of obstacles. The meaning lies in liberation, attaining carefree purity and clarity. Those of shallow understanding and limited learning should not presume to partake.\n\nThe names of these individuals are recorded below the names of the Three Masters.\n\n---\n\n**3. Master of the Divine Incantations of the Abyssal Caverns**\n[The disciple’s] name and style: In the reign of [so-and-so], in the year of [Tai Sui’s] [such-and-such] cyclical sign, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, [so-and-so], a male/female disciple from [such-and-such] village in [such-and-such] county, aged [so-many] years, now at [such-and-such] location, received the *Dongyuan Divine Mantra Registers, Scriptures, and Precepts*.\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters are as follows:\n- **Initiation Master:** From the oratory of [such-and-such] prefecture; a *Dong* Dharma Master, surnamed [so-and-so], named [so-and-so], aged [so-many] years, with [such-and-such] appearance.\n- **Register Master and Scripture Master:** [Same format as above.]\n\n---\n\n**4.

Master of Ascending the Mystery**\n[The disciple’s] name and style: In the reign of [so-and-so], in the year of [Tai Sui’s] [such-and-such] cyclical sign, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, [so-and-so], a disciple of the *Shengxuan* tradition from the oratory of [such-and-such] county, now at [such-and-such] location, received the *Great Contract of the Seventy-Two Characters of Shengxuan*, the *One Hundred Twenty-Nine Precepts of the Great One*, along with the scriptures and contracts.\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters are as follows:\n- **Initiation Master, Register Master, and Scripture Master:** [Same format as above.]\n\n---\n\n**6. Master of the Cavern Mystery**\n[The disciple’s] name and style: In the reign of [so-and-so], in the year of [Tai Sui’s] [such-and-such] cyclical sign, on the [such-and-such] day of the [such-and-such] month, [so-and-so], a disciple of the *Dongxuan* tradition, aged [so-many] years, at the numinous mountain retreat or oratory of [such-and-such] prefecture, [such-and-such] county, received the *Natural Contracts of Lingbao*, the *Upper Grade Precepts of Closing the Six Passions*, the *Middle Alliance Scriptures and Upper Grade Precepts of Wisdom*, the *Great Alliance of the Three Primes and One Hundred Eighty Precepts*, and the *Two Registers of the True Writ*.\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters are as follows:\n- **Initiation Master, Register Master, and Scripture Master:** [Same format as above.]\n\nThe names and styles of the Three Masters serving as *Lin Tan Zheng Ming* follow the above format.\n\n---\n\n**7.

The other two follow the same format.\n\n---\n\nThe above is written in black ink on yellow silk. The master burns incense and bestows it [upon the disciple].\n\nThe disciple, upon receiving each master’s name, bows three times in succession. If the master possesses a genealogy, it shall also be copied and transmitted separately as prescribed in the scriptures. Once the disciple has memorized and refined [the teachings], they shall seal them together with the dharma.\n\nThe Six Illuminations, Five Safeguards, and Three Witnesses, though not within the bounds of constant contemplation, are the causes of my accomplishment—thus they should also be borne in mind as steps toward entering perfection. Hence they are recorded here.\n\nHere ends the text on the names, styles, appearances, and abodes of the Three Masters of the Dongxuan Lingbao tradition.",
