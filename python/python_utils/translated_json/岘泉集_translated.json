The Dao is not illuminated without literature, and literature is not established without the Dao. Though analytically they may be considered two, in essence they are fundamentally one.\n\nThe covering and bearing of Heaven and Earth, the transformation of yin and yang, the alternation of cold and heat, the coming and going of the sun and moon, the flowing and standing of mountains and rivers, the flourishing and withering of grasses and trees—none of these are apart from the Dao, none apart from literature. How could they be separated into two, or forcibly united as one?\n\nThus, when the sages arose, they followed the Dao of spontaneity and expressed it as the literature of spontaneity, never imposing the slightest trace of their own intent. Therefore, they composed the *Book of Changes* in accordance with the principles of transformation, the *Book of Documents* in accordance with the forms of instruction, the *Book of Songs* in accordance with the traces of governance, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in accordance with the methods of praise and blame, the *Book of Rites* in accordance with the substance of ritual decorum, and the *Book of Music* in accordance with the function of harmony. These Six Classics endure through Heaven and Earth, uniting past and present without change, precisely because they arise from spontaneity.\n\nWhere else could later writers of literature turn? After the decline of the Zhou, the Kingly Way faded and the Hundred Schools flourished, each vying with private opinions and conjectural theories, displaying rhetorical skill to outdo one another. Among them, scarcely one or two did not deviate from the Dao.\n\nAt that time, there was Laozi, whose words took non-action and quiescence as the Dao, and who composed a work of over five thousand characters. Later ages have seen those who governed by his teachings and achieved order—perhaps these came closest to the Dao.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Succession, Celestial Master Zhang of Non-Action, inherited the teachings of Laozi through his family lineage, being the forty-third transmission. By nature, the Master was keenly intelligent and of towering talent and insight. He exhaustively studied the texts of the Jade Treasury, the alchemical crucible, and the golden and jade scriptures of the Daoist canon, while also delving deeply into the Six Classics, the philosophers, the histories, and the works of the Hundred Schools. In the realm of literary composition, he brought each form to its utmost refinement.\n\nThus, in his successive appointments to the imperial court, he was ever esteemed for the excellence of his learning, deeply favored by the celestial canopy, and repeatedly honored with special commendations and the honor of being summoned to the imperial presence, his annual stipends ever increasing. The princes, nobles, high ministers, and scholar-officials all treated him with the utmost reverence. For in the literary heartland of Jiangyou, where the legacy of Master Wen Zheng of Wu and Master Wen Jing of Yu still flourished, the Master surpassed even their achievements. How could his attainments have been merely incidental?\n\nWhen asked to inspect his collected poetry and prose—several dozen scrolls in all—and to compose a preface, I found his verse to be profound and serene, his prose rich and elegant, so that one reads with admiration unceasing. How do they compare to those of this age, who cling to their glosses and exegeses, complacently content with mere talent and skill?\n\nYet the Master, bearing the weighty responsibility of leading the ancestral lineage of the Dao, devoted himself wholly to transforming others, guiding them toward goodness, and aiding the state in securing its blessings. What appears here in these writings is but the overflow of his vast learning. Nevertheless, I have observed that the Master’s virtue and work are rooted in non-action, enabling him to roam the mind in the Great Beginning and unite with the Dao. Moreover, he has steeped himself in the literary arts of the Six Classics, explored the doctrines of the Hundred Schools, and thus, when he gives expression to his thoughts in writing, principle and intent converge, achieving excellence without striving for it. How could his contributions to the Way of Laozi and Zhuangzi be compared to the boasts of those who indulge in wild fantasies?\n\nAs the Master and I share a bond of lifelong friendship, whenever we discuss these matters, we do so with animated delight, clapping our hands in lively discourse until the conversation is exhausted. Thus, I have written this preface.\n\nThe work is titled *Xiànquán*, after the name of his retreat.\n\nPreface by Wang Shen of Jinhua, Erudite of the Directorate of Education.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Xiànquán* Literary Collection of the Celestial Master of Non-Action of Qishan**\n\nThe *Xiànquán* Collection is the work of the Perfected Zhang, the forty-third Celestial Master in succession from the Han. The Perfected One’s learning and conduct run deep, his natural endowments and insight surpassing all others. He has mastered the Three Teachings, fusing them into a single path, and has thoroughly explored the doctrines of the various philosophers and the Hundred Schools, attaining effortless clarity in all. Thus, when he gives voice to his literary compositions and discourses, they are bold, towering, and magnificent—reading them stirs one to ceaseless applause.\n\nI have long admired his writings, which flow like clouds traversing the sky, radiant and resplendent, their transformations beyond measure, assuming myriad forms in an instant, brilliant in their artistry. They are also like autumn waters, rich and deep, stirred by a gentle breeze into waves that stretch across ten thousand acres, a single expanse of jade-like clarity, profound in their serenity. His *ci*, *fu*, poetry, and songs each achieve the utmost in grace, freshness, and purity, capturing the natural wonder of Heaven’s spontaneity—truly a work that combines every excellence and embodies all beauty.\n\nI have heard that on the famed Dragon-Tiger Mountain, where numinous *qi* gathers and the finest essences converge, Perfected Ones have emerged in succession, transmitting the Dao and its virtue through the ages. Yet it is only in the present Perfected One that I see one whose inner richness of the Dao is matched by the outward brilliance of his literary art, making him a literary colossus of his age.\n\nSince the founding of our august dynasty, the Great Progenitor, the High Emperor, unified the realm, and the vital *qi* of heaven and earth flourished in full. The celestial mandate has prospered, and culture has flourished for over thirty years. Since the present Emperor ascended the throne, the *qi* has grown ever more abundant, and the mandate ever more prosperous. Even in the remotest corners of the land, none fail to display their talents and present their works, striving to distinguish themselves in their time. How much more so in this land of literary heritage, this lineage of divine brilliance, where one may leisurely bask in the imperial grace and immerse oneself in the classics? Thus, the *Xiànquán* Collection, Scroll One, composed by the Celestial Master of Non-Action, Zhang Yuchu of Qishan.\n\n*Chongdao* [Carving of the Dao]\n\nWithin the utmost void, vast and boundless, the myriad existences take form. The substantial resides within the void, desolate and without limit, as a single *qi* pervades the emptiness. Without the void, things could not transform and circulate, as if lacking a vessel to contain their subtle workings; yet within the substantial, there are indeed convergence and dispersion, presence and absence. Without the substantial, *qi* could not bind and weave, open and close, as if lacking a foundation to conceal its function; yet within the void, there are ascent and descent, growth and decline, movement and stillness.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth takes the Great Void as its essence, while the ceaseless generation and transformation of the myriad things between them arise from the interplay of yin and yang, movement and stillness. The alternation of cold and heat, the distinction of day and night, the ceaseless revolution of heaven—manifest as the luminous sun and stars, majestic as thunder and lightning, nourishing as wind, rain, frost, and dew. The ceaseless revolution of earth—towering as mountains and peaks, flowing as rivers and seas, flourishing as grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. From the grand and lofty to the myriad forms below, from the tiniest crawling insects to the subtlest stirrings, all are encompassed within the utmost void, their profound and wondrous workings beyond comprehension. This is what is called the Dao, the Principle.\n\nWere the Dao not so vast, the Principle not so refined, how could it govern such supremely subtle and wondrous mechanisms? Thus it encompasses heaven and earth, engenders and nurtures the myriad things, fulfilling the Dao of participation and assistance.\n\nTherefore, those who know the Dao do not observe things but observe the heart-mind. For the heart-mind governs nature and emotions, and the Principle resides within it; *qi* is bound to form, both flowing from the mandate of heaven. Called \"numinous emptiness,\" \"Supreme Ultimate,\" \"the Center,\" or \"the One,\" these are the heart-mind’s original state—thus the heart-mind is the Supreme Ultimate. Every thing possesses this nature. The tangled forms and colors of things, their resonant sounds, all arise from the harmonious yet unequal blending of being and non-being.\n\nThe profusion and flux of the myriad things are but the dregs and embers of *qi*. Both humans and the ten thousand things dwell together in the Void. Yet within the minute compass of a square inch, the heart-mind can fill the vastness of the cosmos and encompass the multitude of things, moving in tandem with heaven and earth without discord—this is because when the heart-mind is empty, the ten thousand existences are all contained therein.\n\nWhy should joy and anger, delight and sorrow, fleeting pleasure and gain or loss suffice to obstruct our emptiness or block our thoroughfare? When emptiness prevails, its function is effortless. As my *Laozi* says: \"The Dao is hollow, yet its use is inexhaustible; profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\" \"Hollow\" is but another name for emptiness. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Only the Dao abides in emptiness.\" *Liezi* says: \"Emptiness finds its proper dwelling, for only emptiness can contain.\" When the Dao gathers, spirit congeals; when spirit congeals, *qi* transforms; when *qi* transforms, it becomes one with the Great Void, flows in unison with heaven and earth, and the two *qi* and five phases circulate through the six directions, ceaselessly coming and going—all in harmonious interplay, sharing the same function.\n\nIf one empties the heart-mind of contentious thoughts and preserves it with unity, then within it is empty yet not full, outwardly it is clear yet not stagnant—deep as an abyss, bright as a mirror. Thus one’s inherent nature aligns with the virtue of heaven, and how could it not be the ancestor of the myriad things? Therefore, in nurturing its substance, one discards ornamentation, forgets self and other, severs defilements, and exhausts the work of attaining emptiness and preserving stillness—thereby returning to life and reverting to the root, deepening the root and securing the stem, cleansing the mirror of the mysterious. Embracing the One and guarding the Center, the Valley Spirit endures; thoughts are purified, desires diminished; emptiness reaches its extreme, stillness its utmost—one returns to the Limitless. Then emptiness and quiescence become luminous and penetrating, and things no longer enslave us but are enslaved by us.\n\nIn fulfilling its function, one casts off the limbs and body, sets aside cleverness and brilliance, takes the fundamental as essence, the external as coarse, inquiry as the root, and restraint as the guiding principle—thus nothing remains to be seen. Before heaven and earth, at the beginning of *qi*, form, and substance, there were the Great Beginning, the Great Commencement, and the Great Simplicity—the primordial Kunlun of chaos. When clarity and turbidity separated, essence emerged and radiated, measuring things and bestowing life: essence became the Three Luminaries, the sun and moon the Five Phases; phases gave rise to emotions, emotions to the marrow within, the marrow to spirit and illumination, spirit and illumination to virtue and power, and virtue and power to patterns and ornamentation. The yang does not stir without giving rise to its teachings; the yin does not rest without accomplishing its transformations.\n\nApplied to governing the state and cherishing the people, entrusted to the world, it renders the world clear and upright. All this takes non-action and tranquility as its foundation, humility and restraint as its root—is this not the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingship? Yet within the formless and boundless, all is the function of the heavenly Dao. Here there are mutual stirring and engendering, mutual overthrow and shaping, mutual reliance and concealment—ineffable, unfathomable. Is this not the spirit’s boundlessness, the *Yijing*’s formlessness? Yet the mechanisms of heaven and earth, the reckonings of things and affairs, can be foreknown and hidden away. From emptiness comes numinosity, and spirit operates within, unfolding its knowledge. Though there be myriad changes and transformations, all emerge from this.\n\nOnly by serving heaven with sincerity, nurturing life with harmony, and benefiting things with compassion does the burden of heaven respond without distinction. There is no exalted deed difficult to practice, no extraordinary discourse to delight in. Why speak of cunning, deceit, or divine marvels? It is simply a matter of harmonizing *qi* with emptiness and following things as they are. Of those who applied this and saw results: Guangcheng instructed the Yellow Emperor, Cao Shen heeded Gaitong, the Yellow Stone admonished the Marquis of Liu, and the Han governed through tranquility. Some say they appropriated this to advance their own schemes, seeking personal gain without regard for righteousness—this is perhaps an overstatement.\n\nYet history records that Huang-Lao and the Legalists, with recluses offering unrestrained critiques, blended Lao-Zhuang with Guan-Yan, and from this emerged Shen Buhai, Han Fei, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Zou Yan, Sunzi, Shang Yang, Lü Buwei, Chao Cuo, and Chun Yu—later degenerating into the stratagems of Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Gan Mao, and Cai Ze, causing grievous harm. It is not merely that their emptiness and annihilation were pathological; rather, during the Wei-Jin period, Liu, Ruan, Wang, and He engaged in lofty but reckless discourse, subverting ethics. Han Yu called it worse than Yang Zhu and Mo Di, claiming Lao-Zhuang caused ruin. How could those who study this not drown in bias and lose themselves in excess, ultimately inviting collapse? How could they avoid the world’s censure and reproach? Their harm was even greater than that of the Legalists and unrestrained critics!\n\nNevertheless, one must examine it with precision and seek it with restraint. Only then can one know the vastness and breadth of the Lao-Zhuang Dao. Alas, the Dao is one—its subtle, wondrous, and penetrating essence, the marvel of spirit’s response to the infinitesimal—how could it be divided in two? Moreover, within the profound and obscure lies essence; within the vague and indistinct lies form. Within my central yellow shoulder, inner emptiness and outer harmony flow through the four limbs and unite with the hundred spirits. The five *qi* congeal and spread, merging with the vigorous and compliant virtues of heaven and earth.\n\nIts essentials lie in unifying one’s nature, nurturing one’s *qi*, roaming the beginning and end of the myriad things, and securing the preservation of pure *qi*. As Master Sima said: \"The myriad things all originate from the Void, are born of *qi*; *qi* forms the body, the body receives nature, nature distinguishes names, names establish conduct, and conduct awaits destiny. Thus the Void is the storehouse of things.\" This is what he meant by the Void. The operation of the Void begins with the five phases: one and six placed behind, two and seven placed before, three and eight placed to the left, four and nine placed to the right, circulating through fifty-five phases—this is what is called \"the Void’s profound mystery.\"\n\nThis, too, is one aspect of the art of safeguarding destiny. Only by maintaining emptiness within can one fathom the divine and comprehend transformation, thereby attaining the Dao of tracing origins and returning to endings. As for refining the corporeal soul, expelling the void to master *qi*, riding the uprightness of heaven and earth, and harnessing the fluctuations of the six *qi*; roaming the eight directions in spirit, transcending the posterior heaven to reach the end, exhausting the boundless cycles of worldly change; roaming the mind in tranquility, merging *qi* with the vastness—thus surpassing the primal state of chaos and soaring beyond the primordial mist: gazing through the ages as if in a single breath, viewing life and death as but morning and evening. Like the cicada’s molt, like the breath’s exhalation. Before the beginning of heaven and earth, after their end—all is the operation of my emptiness. How can this be compared to those who cling to life, grasp at things, and refuse transformation?\n\nIf one merely steals fame and seizes reputation in their time, their obscuration by deceit and entanglement in excess, their ceaseless toil and anxious striving—how do they differ from dust and chaff? They are but thieves of names and usurpers of praise. Alas! To know the attainment of emptiness is to be enlightened; enlightenment leads to purity, purity to penetration, penetration to the divine. Divinity achieves speed without haste, arrival without movement—responding to all, reaching all. Otherwise, how can one be deemed a true student of our Old Master? Who can speak of the ultimate emptiness with such as these?\n\n**Vigilance in Foundations**\nLearning must have a foundation—this is what is meant by \"ordering the world and transcending it.\" If learning is not directed toward what is essential, it cannot be deemed worthy of aspiration. What is essential? The learning of ordering the world, which is the Dao of the sages and worthies. And what is the Dao of the sages and worthies? It is the Way of virtue and power, nature and destiny, benevolence and righteousness.\n\nAt the dawn of the Three Dynasties, the Dao resided in Tang and Yu. Later speakers of the Dao invariably pointed to this. For the Dao was luminous under the Three Sovereigns, virtue resplendent under the Five Emperors, and laws perfected under the Three Kings. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu as rulers fulfilled the Dao of rulership; Gaoyao, Yi, Fu, Zhou, and Shao as ministers fulfilled the Dao of ministership; Confucius, Yan, Zeng, Zisi, and Mencius as teachers fulfilled the Dao of teaching. What has been modeled for ten thousand generations remains unchanged.\n\nThe sages and worthies are distant, yet their Dao endures in the Six Classics. The *Book of Changes* illuminates yin and yang, deducing the transformations of creation; the *Book of Songs* guides human nature and emotions, distinguishing the orthodoxy and heterodoxy of *feng* and *ya*; the *Book of Documents* records governance and affairs, chronicling the continuities and reforms of decrees; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* demonstrates rewards and punishments, clarifying the hierarchy of honoring kings and restraining hegemons; the *Book of Rites* refines ritual and decorum, elucidating the distinctions of rank and duty; the *Book of Music* harmonizes *qi* and connection, attaining the harmony of heaven and earth. All the essentials of the sages’ transmission of the mind and imparting of the Dao are fully contained herein—nothing surpasses this.\n\nYet the profound subtleties of the Six Classics are all present; how could our minds, luminous and clear, not derive them from this? From Yao and Shun onward, the transmission was simply to \"hold the center and maintain reverence,\" to dwell in the mind. Confucius spoke of benevolence, Zisi of sincerity, the *Great Learning* of reverence, Mencius of the mind, and the *Doctrine of the Mean* of the center—all converge as one. To achieve the work of unifying heaven and humanity is to attain centrality and harmony, preserve sincerity and clarity, exhaust the principles of things, and fulfill the natures of beings. Only then can one assist heaven and earth in their positions, nurture the myriad things, regulate the Dao of heaven and earth, and aid the suitability of heaven and earth. Thus, wisdom encompasses the myriad things, and the Dao aids the world. This is the Dao of the noble person: rooted in the self, verified among the people, examined in the Three Kings, established in heaven and earth, tested by ghosts and spirits, and awaited by a hundred generations of sages without doubt.\n\nTo establish the ultimate for heaven and earth, to establish destiny for the people, to uphold the constants, and to support the teachings of the world—steadfast and unyielding. Guarding it as the great constant, practicing it as the great law; manifest as ritual and music, hidden as ghosts and spirits—it cannot be abandoned for a single day or separated for a moment. One must devote oneself to the work of vigilance, reverence, and awe in the moments of solitary reflection and the junctures of action and restraint, so that the body is established and its function enacted.\n\nFirst, cessation leads to stability; stability to stillness; stillness to peace; peace to contemplation; contemplation to attainment. Over time, even the obscure can achieve sincerity; sincerity takes form; form becomes manifest; manifestation becomes luminous; luminosity moves; movement transforms; transformation evolves—all derived from the self. Is this not the fulfillment of nature and destiny, dwelling in benevolence and following righteousness? Gathered, it retreats into secrecy; applied, it serves the world and the state in small matters, and governs the world and the state in great ones.\n\nThe teachings of Xun, Yang, Dong, Han, Zhou, Cheng, Shao, Zhang, Zhu, and Lü all carry the Dao, serving as wings to the Classics. The writings of Zuo, Qu, Jia, Sima, Li, Liu, Ouyang, Su, Zeng, and Wang—all composed to express the Dao, not merely to convey it. Without the Dao, however skillful, they are of no value. Thus, when cultivated as virtue and conduct, and expressed as literature, all align with the true Dao.\n\nYet since the Qin and Han dynasties, there have been studies of memorization, literary composition, and cunning schemes—each distinct, yet none approaching the learning of the sages and worthies. Their words aim to benefit ten thousand generations and leave an indelible legacy. Exhausting the greatness of heaven and earth, one knows not its limit; harmonizing the balance of yin and yang, one knows not its truth; plumbing the depths of ghosts and spirits, one knows not its secrecy. How can mere ornamentation, embellishment, plagiarism, or ostentation—designed to astonish the world and impress the vulgar—suffice? Without seeking true knowledge and practical realization, how can one determine the right course in action and speech, silence and stillness?\n\nHere Confucius and Mencius traversed the states, seeking to put their Dao into practice. When the Dao could not be realized, they withdrew to cultivate their own integrity, thus preserving the balance between engagement and retreat. Therefore, those who withdraw to distant heights, aspiring to transcend illusion and rise above the dust of the world, must seek the Dao that transcends the mundane—this is what we call the teaching of Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nLaozi first served as the Archivist of Zhou beneath the pillars, later becoming the Keeper of the Royal Archives. He composed the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls, expounding the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness. Those who shared Laozi’s path included Taigong, who instructed King Wen; Guan Yin, who served as magistrate; Kang Cang, who dwelt in Mount Weilei; Zhuangzi, who governed the Lacquer Garden; and Liezi, who resided in the gardens of Zheng. Like the lofty recluses Chao Fu and Xu You, the pure Boyi and Shuqi, and the hidden Shang Hao, they held fast to their principles without bending. To them, fame was but a guest to reality; they would rather dwell in filth than be adorned like sacrificial oxen. Daily they embraced jars and carried reeds, content in their lot—whether noble or base, joyful or sorrowful, gaining or losing—nothing could burden their hearts. Thus, with single-minded focus, they entered the center of the ring and responded to the boundless. They could govern heaven and earth, store all things, take heaven and earth as their great furnace and creation as their great bellows. The cosmos was too narrow to measure their breadth, thunder too feeble to match their spirit, rivers and seas too shallow to plumb their depth, mountains and peaks too low to rival their height, ghosts and spirits too dim to fathom their mystery. They straightened crookedness into benevolence, trod the forked path as righteousness, let flow what was scattered as joy, and plucked what was obscure as ritual. They equated life and death, harmonized self and other, defied poverty and success, and stood alone in their singular way, unwavering.\n\nThus, the Three Powers were unified, the myriad things made equal, the principles of things mastered, and forms and vessels given abode. Governing the world was as effortless as shaping clay. In non-action, they used the world with ease; in action, they were used by the world and found it insufficient. They regarded life as an excrescence, death as the bursting of a boil, and external things as mere attachments—thus aligning with those free from desire. Their words abounded in parables and grand discourses, unbridled and vast. Yet in stillness, they were sages; in motion, they were kings. Still, they shared the virtue of yin; in motion, they rode the waves of yang. Their movement was like heaven, their stillness like earth; they commanded the transformations of things while guarding their essence. Those confined within form and qi could not disturb their constancy beyond it. In harmony with the harmony of heaven, attuned to the joy of heaven, resting in the balance of heaven, and flowing with the natural division of heaven, they entrusted themselves to the myriad transformations, roaming alone in the celestial realm—thus preserving their heavenly integrity. Had they not embodied the boundless and wandered without trace, becoming companions of heaven, how could they have achieved this?\n\nTo them, the paths of chariots and carriages, the realms of fame and profit, were as nothing. They did not flaunt falsehoods to delude the world, nor parade their conduct to mislead the masses, seeking to be seen as proud or eccentric. Such was their Dao. Yet later scholars, failing to seek the root of Dao and virtue or the foundation of nature and destiny, instead indulge in base, deluded, and absurd practices, hoping to glimpse the primordial chaos of the Great Beginning—how could they possibly succeed?\n\nConsider the humble worm that feeds on petals, nests in thistles, wears a sorrowful countenance, and lives meagerly, starving its body and fraying its garments, so that others can scarcely bear the sight. Its dwelling is shared with woodcutters and herdsmen, deer and swine; its joy lies in mist and clouds, fish and birds. Its heart is like dead ashes, its form like withered wood. It holds itself in high esteem, regards itself from afar, and treats itself with gravity—how could mere worldly splendor move it in the slightest? Even if one arrived with a team of four horses and a chest of gold, it could not be reached. If forced to approach, it would vanish in an instant, leaving no trace, no lingering form. When the Dao aligned, it remained; when the Dao departed, it left—content with what it inherently possessed. How could lavish offerings, ornate dwellings, or positions of power ever bind or constrain it? These are the lofty ones of the world—the followers of Jie Yu and He Xian.\n\nYet those who feign such ways to curry favor with the world are different. In retreat, they are reckless; in advancement, they are aggressive, seeking fame and fleeting praise. Rising suddenly from obscurity, they abandon their principles at the first opportunity, indulging in extravagance—refining their attire, savoring fine foods, swelling with arrogance, boasting in speech, filling their retinues with ostentation, and adorning their dwellings with splendor. Their companions are the eminent and powerful; their attendants scurry about, vying to be their peers. With darting glances and haughty airs, they proclaim to the crowd: \"Behold, this is the Dao, this is virtue, the essence of learning, the spirit of cultivation—who would not revere and exalt it?\" Yet what drives their scramble and competition is power, profit—what do they know of Dao and virtue?\n\nAlas, those who adorn reality with false names—why not simply seize the world’s clamor and exclusion? They seek to deceive the age and please the times. Who knows that even if they dazzle for a moment, their delusions will ultimately be exposed? How could they ever earn the trust of later generations? This is precisely what those of true Dao do not do.\n\nI fear that the decline of customs and the vulgarity of mores will flow unchecked, resist all restraint, and grow ever more rampant—all because people fail to guard the root. Moreover, when the noble person errs in engagement or withdrawal, speech or silence, straying from righteousness and the Dao, how grievous and perverse it becomes! Can one not be cautious?\n\nTo know what to guard is to unite the Dao in oneness. To abandon this is to render all learning meaningless.\n\nSomeone asked in profound inquiry: What does the Daoist school mean by \"profound\" (xuan)?\n\nAnswer: \"Profound\" refers to Heaven. It is the great origin of the Dao that issues from Heaven.\n\nQuestion: Does this not begin with Laozi’s phrase \"profound and yet more profound\"?\n\nAnswer: Precisely. I have heard from historians that the Daoist school enables one to unify spirit and focus, to move in accord with the formless, and to embrace the myriad things. In its practice of self-preservation, it follows the great harmony of yin and yang, adopts the virtues of Confucianism and Mohism, and distills the essentials of the School of Names and Legalism. Adapting to the times and responding to change, it establishes customs and implements affairs with perfect appropriateness—its principles concise and easy to grasp, its efforts minimal yet its achievements vast.\n\nAs for the essentials of the great Dao: it discards aggressiveness and desire, rejects cunning and cleverness. If one abandons these and relies on self-preservation, there is nothing to be gained. It is also said: The Daoist school practices non-action yet leaves nothing undone. Its reality is easy to practice, though its words are difficult to comprehend. Its self-preservation is rooted in emptiness and non-being, and its function lies in following the natural course. Without fixed power or constant form, it can thoroughly investigate the nature of the myriad things. It does not precede things, nor does it follow them—yet it can serve as the master of all things. This is why the Grand Historian placed the Yellow Emperor and Laozi before the Six Classics.\n\nLaozi lived at the end of the Zhou dynasty and once served as Archivist beneath the Pillars. As the Zhou declined, he composed the *Upper* and *Lower Classics* and then withdrew into reclusion. His disciples included Guan Yin, Kang Cang, Zhuangzi, and Liezi, all of whose teachings fundamentally aimed at cultivating the Dao and virtue, preserving life and destiny. Internally, one cultivates by embracing the One and guarding the center to preserve life; externally, one acts without contention or striving to benefit others. Only by abiding in great harmony, moving in accord with nature, being cautious within and inquiring without, and maintaining purity without admixture can one attain stillness and unity without change, resting in boundless tranquility. When in motion, one follows the movement of Heaven, thereby aligning with Heaven’s virtue.\n\nThough engaged in the world, one employs compassion, frugality, humility, and restraint, ensuring that one’s actions do not exceed what is necessary. Firmly guarding withdrawal and concealment, one does not act for the sake of things, returning instead to emptiness, simplicity, purity, stillness, non-action, softness, and plainness. Thus, when the world’s things are based in humility, they remain unburdened; when they contain emptiness, they encounter no obstacles; when they proceed with ease, they face no difficulties; and when they adapt with flexibility, they meet no blockages. The people are thus enabled to transform themselves, return to simplicity, and rectify themselves.\n\nThe aim is to preserve the original nature of things and return to the primordial unity. Therefore, it does not cling to the entanglements of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, governance, education, or custom—yet this is not to say these are incompatible with the world. Indeed, when the Zhou declined and customs grew shallow, the Daoists sought to remedy corruption and save the age, restoring it to pure antiquity. They adopted the virtues of Confucianism and Mohism.\n\nConfucius once inquired of Laozi about ritual. Laozi said: \"Those who are keenly perceptive and deeply discerning yet near to death are those who delight in criticizing others. Those who are broadly learned and far-reaching in argument yet endanger themselves are those who expose the faults of others.\" This is what Confucius meant by being broadly learned in antiquity and knowledgeable of the present—words he heard from the venerable Laozi.\n\nWhen Yangzi rejected universal love, he met Laozi and abandoned his contentiousness to yield his seat. When Mozi advocated uniformity and the worship of spirits, his teachings bore some resemblance to Daoism, and the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi further blended these ideas. The School of Names, in governing the state and commanding armies, valued worthy men and cherished the people, approaching Daoist thought. The School of Vertical and Horizontal Alliances, in its strategies of expansion and contraction, strength and weakness, gain and loss, also bore similarities. Yet none have endured as long or served as the foundation of the Dao like the practices of unifying spirit, embracing the myriad things, discarding aggressiveness and desire, and rejecting cunning and cleverness—all of which take emptiness and non-being as their root.\n\nIf one is without desire and returns to simplicity, without pretense yet trustworthy, blunting sharpness, resolving entanglements, harmonizing light with dust, placing oneself last yet coming first, and setting oneself aside yet enduring—then one can bend to preserve the whole, straighten the crooked, know fullness yet guard humility, and know the new yet preserve the old. Thus, one may be bright yet appear dim, advance yet seem to retreat, eloquent yet appear inarticulate, skillful yet seem clumsy, and upright yet appear bent. Without cutting away one’s square edges or defiling one’s integrity, one may be direct yet not unrestrained, radiant yet not dazzling, thereby preserving one’s efficacy.\n\nIf one acts with sincerity, proceeds with simplicity, responds with forgiveness, and answers with silence, regarding worldly affairs as coarse traces and emptiness as the wondrous function—then the Confucians, with their parables and fanciful discourses, may dismiss these as absurd and impractical, unsuited to worldly use. Nevertheless, such teachings do not depart from the principles of the Three Powers, the order of the myriad things, the constancy of life and death, or the external traces of affairs. They truly reveal what lies beyond the Six Directions, before Heaven and Earth, gathering the ten thousand existences into a single breath and dispersing a single breath into the ten thousand existences.\n\nThis is called \"serene quiescence,\" \"profound depth,\" \"lucid clarity,\" \"empty sameness,\" and \"obscure darkness.\" Truly, it is vast and boundless, wandering in the Great Beginning. Moreover, the movements of Heaven and Earth: the light and pure that rise and float are accumulations of qi; the heavy and turbid that sink and settle are accumulations of earth. Circulating through the Six Voids, they come and go without end, expanding and contracting, advancing and retreating, hard and soft, flowing through day and night, alternating with the four seasons. Wind and thunder shape forms, the myriad beings emerge and grow, self-generating and self-transforming, self-forming and self-coloring, self-dissolving and self-ceasing. The ten thousand things intermingle in chaos yet remain undivided; their black forms and material qualities all contain the essence of Heaven and Earth and are transformed into life.\n\nThus, they are constantly generating and constantly transforming without cease. Their alternations of darkness and light, their succession without a moment’s difference—this is why one transcends Heaven and Earth, leaves the myriad things behind, escapes the confines of principle and qi, and enters the boundless, traceless origin of creation. It cannot be measured by sound or scent, nor sought through images or numbers. Obscure, indistinct, and imperceptible, it transcends the ten thousand things and serves as their root—how could it not be the most profound and subtle?\n\nWhen Yang Xiong spoke of the \"profound,\" he aligned it with the numbers of the *Book of Changes*, establishing the divisions of regions, states, districts, and households—this was merely one aspect of calendrical studies, not what I call the profound.\n\nSima Qian said: Those who study Laozi disparage the Confucians, while those who study the Confucians likewise disparage Laozi—why must they mutually ridicule one another so fiercely? Yet the excellence of the profound and empty lies precisely in this: later followers who took it as their creed erred into absurdity, bias, and distortion. Could this truly be the fault of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nThe true learner must therefore seek the root of emptiness and nothingness—this is what I call the profound. Someone asked: When you speak of the profound, you seem to ground it in reality, yet the classics all speak of it as existing before Heaven and Earth, humbling the cosmos, disparaging hegemonic ways, and exalting the kingly Dao. What they value is turning inward to seek within oneself, cultivating the self to enrich life, transcending form to leave illusion behind—then spiritual transformation becomes unfathomable, and one outlives Heaven to endure. How does this differ from the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nI reply: The Dao is one and the same—how could there be any distinction between emptiness and fullness, reality and unreality? I have examined the records and texts, and they do not deceive. Laozi’s transmission takes the *Daode*’s two chapters as its foundation. Later followers either err through杂乱杂糅 or through wild exaggeration. When they speak of \"inner sageliness and outer kingship,\" they do not lack the art of ruling as a sovereign, but merely apply it differently. In cultivation, they speak of the Valley Spirit and the Mysterious Female, of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, of preserving the center and embracing the One, of abiding in harmony—nothing more.\n\nLater proponents of these teachings inevitably distinguish between the true and the false, the orthodox and the heterodox. The *Yinfu Jing*’s teachings on cultivating the self and governing the world align with the *Daode Jing*. The *Longhu Shangjing*’s text accords with the *Cantong Qi* of the Stone Wall. Yet those who study Laozi—what path could they follow if not that of immortality? Their \"inner elixir\" invariably takes spirit and qi as its foundation, while their \"outer elixir\" invariably takes lead and mercury as its essence. The Golden Liquor shares the same path as Heaven and Earth’s creation, for the Spirit Chamber is the pivot of the elixir, and the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow are the true lead and mercury.\n\nYang ascends and yin descends, never straying from the directions of *zi* and *wu*; the sun departs and the moon arrives, necessarily dwelling in the positions of *mao* and *you*. The Yang Fire rises from *zi* and ascends to *si*, where yang reaches its peak and yin is born at *wu*. The Yin Talisman descends from *wu* to *hai*, where yin reaches its peak and yang is reborn at *zi*. Within the Spirit Chamber, a hollow space an inch in diameter and round in height unites the Three Powers—this is the central crucible of our being. Emerging from yin and entering yang generates true mercury; refining the Mysterious Essence within causes fire to arise from *kan* and water to descend from *li*.\n\nThus, *kan* and *li* take north and south as their warp, cinnabar and mercury being their alternate names. Only water and fire serve as the functions of *qian* and *kun*—these are the two functions of metal and earth. When it speaks of \"three, five, and one,\" the essence of Heaven and Earth, following the Three-in-One yields its principle: the three and five guard one another, and metal and fire mutually circulate. Cinnabar is born within true lead, and metal-fire is true lead itself. Thus the scriptures say: \"Lead is the essence of metal; water is the pivot of the Dao.\" The *Cantong Qi* likewise states: *Qian* and *kun* stand above and below, while *kan* and *li* ascend and descend between them. *Kan*’s *wu* is the moon’s essence; *li*’s *ji* is the sun’s light. The Five Phases serve as the warp, with *kan*’s male metal-essence and *li*’s female fire-light—both reside in the central palace.\n\nEarth’s virtue arises from *zhen* and fills at *qian*, passing through *xun* to wane and reaching *kun* to be exhausted. Moreover, the mutual restraint of being and non-being: the white is metal’s essence, the black is water’s foundation. Metal is water’s mother, the mother concealing the child’s embryo; water is metal’s child, the child hidden in the mother’s womb. When metal returns to its original nature, it is water and metal restoring their nature. For cinnabar is the essence of wood, and when it obtains metal, they unite. Once metal and water merge, wood and fire take the lead. Metal and wood intertwine, water and earth pair to form the elixir.\n\nAs for the \"medicinal substances\": *Qian*’s yang generates *kun*, and *kun*’s yin envelops *qian*. *Qian*’s metal generates *kun*’s earth, symbolizing *qian*’s central line dwelling within *kun*—this is metal and water sharing the same origin. Symbolizing *kun*’s central line dwelling within *qian* is wood and fire sharing the same position. *Qian* and *kun* lodge their bodies within *kan* and *li*, and *kan* and *li* become the functions of *qian* and *kun*. Fire’s completion number is seven, returning to reside in the east’s *zhen* as the Seven Returns. Metal’s completion number is nine, returning to reside in the north’s *kan* as the Nine Reversions. Thus fire is refined by earth, and metal enters to become water, enclosing and flying, congealing and opening the numinous gate.\n\nYet the elixir must be formed by refining lead with fire. As for the \"fire times\": the movement of the Dipper’s pivot and the bell’s pitch are based on the numbers of nine and one, combining the numbers of two, six, three, and nine. The end necessarily returns to the beginning, embracing the origin and holding the true, sowing essence at *zi*. *Yin* and *shen* are the extremes of yin and yang. The method of counting the stalks divides the month into twelve hexagrams, each hexagram receiving two and a half days. Each uses its own hexagram’s lines to perform its own hexagram’s counting. From the *guan* hexagram of the eighth month to the *tai* hexagram of the first month, yang uses the young twenty-eight stalks, and yin uses the old twenty-four stalks. From the *dazhuang* hexagram of the fourth month to the *pi* hexagram of the seventh month, yang uses the old thirty-six stalks, and yin uses the young twenty-two stalks. Twelve hexagrams complete one month’s work; twelve months complete one year’s cycle. Repeating and circulating, there is no excess or deficiency.\n\nThis aligns with Master Shao’s *Xiantian Tu*, both following Fu Xi’s arrangement of the *Yi*’s images and positions. Thus the marvel of the Heavenly Root and Lunar Grotto: yang begins at *fu* and culminates at *qian*; yin arises at *gou* and culminates at *kun*. Cycling through the sixty-four hexagrams, there is not the slightest deviation. This is how it smelts and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, beginning and ending without form, merging with the Great Thoroughfare, and blending into obscurity.\n\nTherefore, it is profoundly vast and cannot be considered external; minutely divided, it cannot be considered internal. Yet it does not transgress the Dao.\n\nThe theory of *na jia* assigns fixed positions: *qian* governs *jia* and *ren*, *kun* governs *yi* and *gui*, *zhen* governs *geng*, *xun* governs *xin*, *gen* governs *bing*, and *dui* governs *ding*. Yet *kan* governs *wu* and *li* governs *ji*, which have no fixed positions. Moreover, the yin and yang of the six hexagrams are but the circulating ascent and descent of the central lines of *kan* and *li*. As Master Zhu observed: these are but provisional devices to embody the rhythms of advance and retreat—well said. Thus the composition of the *Huoji* has its basis.\n\nLater generations, misled by metaphors of cinnabar and mercury, divided the art into \"inner\" and \"outer\" elixirs, each claiming textual authority to dazzle the world. Yet how could one wholly rely on herbs, minerals, or metals to achieve the mechanism of divine transformation? As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Borrowing the names of stones, cloaking itself in borrowed texts.\" Though rarely discussed by the masters, it concerns nothing other than the cultivation of *xing* (nature), *ming* (life), *shen* (spirit), and *xuan* (mystery). To exhaust the supreme principles of yin and yang, to seize the divine power of creation—is this not the culmination of the elixir path?\n\nThe metaphors of the elixir are but borrowed images—what need is there for terms like furnace and cauldron, fire and medicine, lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, infant and maiden, female and male? Yet texts like the *Guanyin* speak of \"infant and alchemical maiden,\" \"golden tower and crimson palace,\" \"azure dragon and white tiger,\" \"precious tripod and red furnace,\" and \"clay idols\"—such language did not exist in the time of Laozi. Some call these apocryphal works. Those who cling to images and obscure texts, abandoning the source to chase the stream, indulging in the bizarre and fantastical to impress the world, utter only the words of charlatans and eccentrics—men like Shaojun, Ledao, Wencheng, Wuli, and Gongsun. Works like the *Baopuzi*’s alchemical transformations, which rely on heterodox methods to deceive the masses and seek fleeting fortune, inevitably lead to ruin through reckless falsehoods.\n\nAlas! Those who speak well of immortality say only: \"See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness.\" Thus one forgets the form to nurture *qi*, forgets *qi* to nurture the spirit, and forgets the spirit to nurture emptiness. He who holds to the Dao attains complete virtue; with complete virtue, the form is whole; with the form whole, *qi* is whole—I cannot alter this. When emptiness reaches its extreme, numinous clarity arises; with numinous clarity, divine transformation occurs, and one becomes a companion of Heaven, roaming the origins of things.\n\nThe light and pure *qi* ascends, and the essence of utmost yang rises with it. Some say: \"The sage does not follow the path of immortals\"—is this not a slander against the world? To seek the Dao, one must only guard the center. If asked: \"Is guarding the center not sufficient for the elixir? Why then are teachings so varied, with countless methods and divergent paths? Can guarding the center alone suffice, or must one rely on external techniques?\" The answer is: Is the Dao divided in two?\n\nHeaven is the accumulation of *qi*; the Supreme Lord is the sovereign of Heaven. From the undifferentiated state before the separation of the Hongyuan, the Three *Xuan* gave rise to existence—these are Fan Qingjing and Xuan Yuanshi. The wondrously non-existent is the origin of *xing*; the wondrously existent is the origin of *xuan*. From the Three *Xuan* arise the Nine *Xuan*—these are the Nine Heavens. The realm of emptiness is boundless; the light and pure *qi* has no form, and the governing spirit has no fixed abode. Yet because the governed have their dependencies, scriptures and records descend to instruct, talismans and methods unfold to elucidate, and thus the teachings are established.\n\nAmong the most prominent transmitters are the Han Celestial Master, the Mao Perfected Lords, Xu Jingyang, Ge the Immortal Elder, and Qiu the Perfected Lord. The Three Caverns and Four Supplements, along with the schools of Qingwei, Lingbao, Shenxiao, and Deng-Yue, are the categories of the Caverns and Supplements—these are the scriptures and records. Qingwei originated with Yuanshi and was expounded by Zhenyuan; later, Wei of Nanyue and Zu of Lingjun carried on the lineage of the four branches. Those who propagated its teachings include Zhu Dongyuan, Li Shaowei, Nan Bidao, Huang Leiyuan, and Li Xuji, followed by Zhang, Xu, Ye, and Xiong, whose influence spread further.\n\nLingbao began with Yuchen, based on the *Duren Jing* and its methods, and was expounded by the Three Perfected Ones of Xuanyi. Later, Xu of Taiji, Zheng of Zhuyang, and Lu of Jianji promoted its teachings. Those who propagated it include Tian Zijin, Yu Dongwei, Du Dazhen, Xiang Deqian, Wang Qingjian, Jin Yunzhong, Gao Ziyuan, Du Guangting, Kou Qianzhi, and Liu Chongjing, followed by Zhao, Lin, Bai, and Chen, whose influence likewise spread—though distinctions arose between the Donghua and Nanchang lineages.\n\nShenxiao encompasses the various Thunder lineages, originating with the Perfected King of Yuqing and expounded by the Fire Master, Perfected Lord Wang. Later, the Lords of Shichen, Xujing, and Xihe, along with Li the Demon-Queller and Xu the Pivot, promoted its teachings. Those who propagated it include Lin Lingsu, Xu Shenweng, Liu Hunkang, Lei Mo’an, Wan Wulei, Fang Pinle, Deng Tieya, followed by Shangguan, Xu, Tan, Yang, Chen, Tang, and Mo, whose influence also spread.\n\nDeng-Yue traces back to Zhu Ximing, Zheng Zhiwei, Lu Yanghao, and Ye Fashan, with those who propagated its teachings including Zuo, Zheng, Pan, and Li, whose lineages flourished further. Yet in essence, none depart from the wonders of the Three *Xuan* and Five Phases.\n\nThe scripture says: \"The Three, Five, and One are the essence of Heaven and Earth\"—these are the numbers of the *Hetu*’s Three and Five. Thus thunder and lightning combine the numbers of nine and one: yang is thunder, yin is lightning; frost arises from lightning, killing from thunder; the pivot is yin, the mechanism is yang; thunder is benevolent, lightning is malevolent—all are concealed within the Supreme Ultimate. Seeking this within the body, the shoulders are the Thunder Enclosure, the Five *Xuan* are the Five Thunders. The heart is the numinous palace, the sovereign of the five senses.\n\nTo merge one’s own numinous essence with the wonders of the Three *Xuan* and Five Phases is to illumine the obscure and shatter the dark—this is refining utmost yin with utmost yang, illuminating utmost darkness with utmost brightness. The Southern Dipper steeps the *hun*-soul, its number the six of water. The Northern Dipper forges the *po*-soul, its number the seven of fire. Through the work of refining oneself, one refines the *hun*, gathering its scattered and benighted qi, transcending its sunk and clinging thoughts, and transforms it into the realm of yang brightness, thereby escaping the realm of yin gloom.\n\nTo command the opening and closing of yin and yang is to conjoin the essence of the Two and Five, to condense the qi of the Nine and One. Cultivated within, it is called the *elixir*; deployed without, it is called the *method*. By stirring the Five *Xuan* to excoriate and produce sound, the functions of rain and sunshine are perfected in the space of a single breath. By employing one’s own spirit to command the spirits of others, in the midst of stillness, this evokes and that responds. Thus are the deadly mechanisms of Heaven and Earth activated, the transformative controls of yin and yang conjoined—all through the power of one’s own numinous essence merging with them in virtue and penetrating the divine.\n\nTo drive out and exorcise malevolent spirits, to ward off and dispel calamities and pestilence, are but minor matters. Moreover, the ancient institutions of invoking Heaven and offering sacrifices, which later devolved into the ornate rituals of *tao* and *ci*, have existed since the time of Emperor Wu of Han. As the saying goes: \"Offerings to the Supreme Emperor, fasting and bathing in purification, to sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor—all are means to express one’s sincerity.\" Though the offerings be as humble as mugwort and reeds from the valleys, they may yet serve, for they embody sincerity. Thus it is said: \"Ghosts and spirits have no constant sustenance; they are sustained by those who attain sincerity. Millet and glutinous rice are not inherently fragrant; it is bright virtue that is fragrant.\" Strive to cultivate the resonance of virtue, that it may be offered to ghosts and spirits.\n\nIf sincerity wanes and virtue is lacking, relying merely on external adornments—embroidered silks, admired scriptures, embellished brocades, intricate patterns, lavish feasts with crossed platters, striving to dazzle the eyes and ears to impress the world and astonish the vulgar—what then is the true purpose of such affairs? Can it truly be about bells, drums, jades, and silks? The symbolic representations of the Dao are all modeled after the celestial and terrestrial deities, their radiance displayed and arrayed in order. These are the established norms, rituals, and canons, all expressions of reverence and utmost sincerity, enabling those who gaze upon and partake in the rites to be thus guided.\n\nYet later generations have acted otherwise, chasing only fame and profit, prizing only ornate embellishments, all abandoning the root to pursue the branch, forsaking the real to compete in the false. How do they differ from the greedy and flattering shamans, scheming only for mouth and body, for goods and wealth? Moreover, they exalt their esoteric chambers, differentiate their paths, and mystify their mechanisms to delude the masses and incite their kind. Those who inherit these ways become habituated to such cliques, not probing within but only dazzled by externals. How far have they strayed from the Dao! What hope is there for any resonance or communion?\n\nAlas! Though the transmissions may differ, they converge on the same path—there is no second Dao. Those who worthily inherit it must broadly study and guard its essentials, thereby resolving doubts and dispelling delusions. It is not merely about boasting of numerous fasts or extraordinary practices. Does the method not say: \"Within the real lies the divine; beyond sincerity, there is no method\"? From this perspective, does it not align with the incantations and revealed secrets?\n\nMoreover, the ancients spoke of the virtue of the master: clad in grass, fed by trees, starving their bodies, tempering their minds and spirits, purifying their qi and thoughts, so that not a shred of worldly desire or emotional filth could lodge within. Thus they regulated their externals, merging the work of Heaven and humanity into one. The divine and luminous dwelled with them; their hearts united with Heaven, so that their hearts were Heaven. Therefore, to unite Heaven with Heaven—there can be no \"that Heaven\" and \"this non-Heaven,\" no \"that mystery\" and \"this non-mystery.\" The mechanism of resonance and response is thus singular—how could there be any interval in its issuance?\n\nThis is the Way of pure simplicity: only the divine is to be guarded. Guard it without losing it, and unite with the divine. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with the heavenly order—is this not fitting? To abandon this and wallow in worldly filth, to be swept away by clamor and ostentation, to be blinded by gaudy splendor, and to take such as teachers and friends—like ants drawn to sweetness or bees swarming, proclaiming daily, \"I am an immortal! I am numinous!\"—is either perverse or delusional. How could this be what Zhuangzi meant by the *Great Master*?\n\nAlas! What the scriptures describe—without Peng and Wei, it would have nearly sunk into the realm of talismans and staves. What the methods conceal—without Wang and Bai, it would have flowed into the domain of shamans. Yet to govern Heaven and Earth, to store the myriad things, to harmonize with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune—still, one must expand upon these words and seek within them. This is what is meant by \"conveying the mandate and penetrating the mysterious,\" which may be silently comprehended.\n\n**Explication of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate**\nThe Supreme Ultimate is the complete embodiment of the Dao. Undifferentiated and without bias, vast and without form or semblance, it is the root of nature and destiny. Nature is endowed by destiny; principle inheres in nature; the heart governs them—this is called the Dao. The body of the Dao is called the *Ultimate of Five*, residing at the center of the Nine Categories—this is the *August Ultimate*. The *Book of Changes* says, \"Converge upon what has ultimate\"; the *Book of Songs* says, \"None are not your ultimate.\" Seeking it thus, it is the heart, the Dao, the center.\n\nMaster Zhou said: \"In the center, it rests.\" Master Cheng said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is the Dao.\" Master Shao said: \"The heart is the Supreme Ultimate.\" Master Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is principle.\" Master Lu said: \"The center is the great root of the world—this is the Ultimate.\" Principle is one; when spoken of together, it is the Dao.\n\nThe Five Phases and yin-yang—yin-yang is the Supreme Ultimate. The Five are distinct, yet the Two are real; the Two and the One are fundamentally one. The Two are real: Heaven, with yang, generates the myriad things; Earth, with yin, completes the myriad things. In movement, yang; in stillness, yin. Yang transforms and yin conjoins, giving rise to the Five Qi, and from the Five Qi, the myriad things are born—hence it is said the Five are distinct. The Five are distinct yet rooted in yin and yang, which are mutually their root.\n\nThe Two Modes arise from yang, interact with yin; yin interacts with yang, giving rise to the Four Images. The Four Images divide, producing the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams intermingle, and the myriad things are born. This is called \"one movement, one stillness\"—is it not the utmost subtlety of Heaven and Earth?\n\nThus, the Five Qi spread, the Four Seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born in ceaseless generation. The Five Phases are but one yin-yang; yin-yang is but one Supreme Ultimate. When the Supreme Ultimate scatters to become the myriad things, each thing possesses its own nature, each contains a single Supreme Ultimate in its wholeness, with stillness ever as its master.\n\nEmbracing both being and non-being, preserving substance and function, containing movement and stillness, it is the source of all transformations and the root of all existence—wondrously uniting the essence of the Two and the Five. Master Zhu said: the Supreme Ultimate is principle; movement and stillness are qi. The Supreme Ultimate is the inherent subtlety; movement and stillness are the mechanism it rides. When the mechanism moves, qi flows and yin-yang operate—how could principle not be manifest? For qi bears principle in generation, and principle takes form through qi; nature presides as master, while yin-yang and the Five Phases interweave in warp and woof.\n\nSpoken of as one, the myriad things share a single Supreme Ultimate in their totality. Spoken of separately, each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate. Moreover, in the primordial chaos of the Great Vastness, primordial qi was the root of the myriad things. Its essence is called principle; its ceaseless flowing of yin and yang is called qi. Thus, before division, the Dao is the Supreme Ultimate; after formation, all things possess this principle. The mind is the Supreme Ultimate—profound and without trace, yet all principles are complete within it. Once yin and yang take form, principle and qi become distinct.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate divides, it first generates one odd and one even; from odd and even, generation proceeds without end. Thus, one divides into two, two into four, four into eight, eight into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, and thirty-two into sixty-four. The sages had no means to express this until Fuxi first drew the lines: a single unbroken line to represent Qian, a broken line to represent Kun—embodying the Supreme Ultimate of our minds. One odd and one even symbolize change; layered, they form hexagrams; divided, they become lines—all the most evident and luminous subtleties of yin and yang.\n\nThis drawing is most vast, most profound, most refined, most subtle—neither visible in the semblance of qi and form, nor attainable through sound, color, shape, or appearance. Radiant and flourishing, empty yet numinous, bright yet wondrous, it scatters into the ten thousand differences and gathers into one root. Without the slightest lapse of time or hair’s-breadth of divergence, it cycles without end, boundless and inexhaustible. Like the revolutions of Heaven and Earth, the moisture of wind and rain, the might of thunder, the solemnity of frost and snow, the flow and towering of mountains and rivers, the flourishing and withering of plants and trees, the subtlety of flying and burrowing creatures, the multitude of moving and growing things—all do not transgress the flowing of Heaven’s mandate, sharing the same endowment.\n\nWhat is called \"having an ultimate\" refers to principle; \"having no ultimate\" refers to form. Yet the utmost extremity of principle is fundamentally formless. If one were to speak of it as \"non-being,\" it could not serve as the root of the myriad transformations. When Master Shao spoke of \"the Ultimateless\" and \"having images,\" \"having\" refers to its true essence as root, while \"non-being\" is its formless, odorless, and transcendent nature. Those who perceive the body of the Dao surely cannot add \"non-being\" to \"being.\"\n\nAs for Laozi’s \"Ultimateless,\" it means formless and boundless; Zhuangzi’s \"Dao exists prior to the Supreme Ultimate\" is of the same sense. As for the numbers of the Yellow River and Luo River charts and the images of the Earlier Heaven, though advance and retreat, fullness and emptiness, growth and decline operate within them, all take emptiness at the center as their ultimate. By emptying the center, the inherent subtlety of the Supreme Ultimate is attained—what difference then remains between obscurity and clarity, communication and obstruction?\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* states: \"The learning of the mind encompasses all affairs; all transformations originate in the mind.\" What the mind possesses is the supreme principle that does not transgress Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Master Cheng said: \"There is principle, then there are images; there are images, then there are numbers.\" The Way of humanity begins in yang and is completed in yin, rooted in stillness and flowing into movement—just as with the myriad things. Yet yang returns to its root in yin, stillness returns to its root in movement; in every movement and stillness, all flow together with Heaven and Earth. Only by mastering stillness is nature established; when nature is established, centrality and uprightness are achieved, and benevolence and righteousness are settled.\n\nThus, substance and function are one, source and manifestation are without distinction. This diagram, Master Zhu said, was received by Zhou Dunyi from Mu Bochang, who received it from Zhong Fang, who received it from Chen Tuan. Since Chen Tuan studied the teachings of Laozi, Master Lu criticized Master Zhu for deriving the Ultimateless from Laozi, while the *Book of Changes* speaks only of \"having an ultimate,\" and Zhou Dunyi’s *Comprehensive Discourse* mentions only yin-yang and the Supreme Ultimate—this is clear. Yet Master Zhu’s gloss of \"formless\" does not deviate from the Dao.\n\nMoreover, in Pan’s record, it is held without doubt that Zhou Dunyi composed it himself. Some also say that Zhou Dunyi, Hu Su, and Shao Gu studied together under a Buddhist monk in Runzhou and received it from him. Yet how could such a teaching be known to a Buddhist monk? Furthermore, earlier scholars regarded the learning of Zhou and Shao—the *Earlier Heaven* and *Supreme Ultimate* diagrams—as sharing one principle, their transmission not necessarily separate. Its essence is most great, encompassing all; its function is most divine, pervading all.\n\nThus it is said: from the hidden and manifest of Heaven and Earth to the insects and plants, nothing is too minute to accord with it. It is to follow the principles of nature and destiny, to exhaust the Way of transformation. The hearts of the sages of all ages are the same—this is not attained by seeking afar, but by returning to what is within oneself. Whether distant as the six directions or near as one’s own body, fleeting as a blink of the eye or subtle as movement and stillness—how could mere words, speech, or hearing suffice to know Heaven? One must devote oneself to the work of convergence and the subtleties of inquiry, so that the luminous and tranquil emptiness of one’s spirit fills the six directions and governs the myriad changes. With time, sincerity becomes refined, hence clarity; spirit responds, hence wonder; subtlety, hence profundity.\n\nThe establishment of images and the depiction of ideas herein dissect and analyze the subtlest truths, leaving nothing unaddressed. The Way of nature and destiny, the discourse on life and death, the tracing of origins and the return to endings—all are fully encompassed within this.\n\nTo weigh noble rank as a mere fraction and regard gold and jade as dust—who could alter this, or dare to cast doubt? Let this resolve such questions.\n\n*On the Primordial Diagram*\nThe *Primordial Diagram* (*Xiantian Tu*) was created by Fuxi. The sequence and positions of its trigrams and lines all derive from the original drawings, unlike the later arrangement of King Wen’s post-celestial order.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"There is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams. Here, yang ascends to intersect with yin, and yin descends to intersect with yang, producing the Four Images of Heaven. The firm intersects with the yielding, and the yielding intersects with the firm, producing the Four Images of Earth. The eight trigrams intermingle, and the myriad things are born therefrom.\n\nTheir numerical sequence is: Qian as one, Dui as two, Li as three, Zhen as four, Xun as five, Kan as six, Gen as seven, and Kun as eight. The Four Images intersect to form sixteen matters, and the eight trigrams intermingle to produce the sixty-four hexagrams—this is the imagery of the Primordial.\n\nAs Master Shao said: \"One divides into two, two into four, four into eight.\" From Qian to Kun, all are trigrams of the unborn. If traced in reverse, they correspond to the four seasons. The *Commentary* states: \"The *Changes* reckon in reverse\"—this is what it means.\n\nTheir positions are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, Kan in the west, Zhen in the northeast, Dui in the southeast, Xun in the southwest, and Gen in the northwest. From Zhen to Qian is the forward sequence; from Xun to Kun is the reverse. Yin is the mother of yang, and yang is the father of yin. The mother conceives the eldest son, giving rise to *Fu* (Return); the father begets the eldest daughter, giving rise to *Gou* (Decay). Thus, yang begins with *Fu*, and yin begins with *Tai* (Pregnancy).\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Heaven and Earth take their positions; mountains and marshes exchange qi; thunder and wind press upon each other; water and fire do not oppose one another. The eight trigrams intermingle.\" The reckoning of what has passed follows the forward sequence, while the knowing of what is to come follows the reverse. The forward sequence, rotating left, consists of already-generated hexagrams; the reverse sequence, rotating right, consists of yet-to-be-generated hexagrams.\n\nThe sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams arises from the eight trigrams arranged in order and then doubled. Thus, the lower three lines correspond to the eight trigrams of the preceding diagram, while the upper three lines are each doubled in sequence, so that the lower trigram also extends into eight. If each line is generated in succession, it follows Master Shao’s principle: \"Eight divides into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, thirty-two into sixty-four.\" All are modeled upon the wonders of natural patterns.\n\nThese are the four diagrams, known as the learning of the Primordial. Yang’s nature is round; when formed, it becomes square. Yin’s nature is square; when imaged, it becomes round. In the circular arrangement, Qian reaches its limit at noon, Kun at midnight, Li at dawn, and Kan at dusk. Yang is born at midnight and culminates at noon; yin is born at noon and culminates at midnight. Here, yang resides in the south, and yin in the north.\n\nIn the square arrangement, Qian begins in the northwest, and Kun ends in the southeast. Here, yang resides in the north, and yin in the south. This is the numerical interplay of yin and yang in opposition. From Kun’s expansion, passing through Gen and Dui, it culminates in Qian; from Qian’s contraction, passing through Xun and Gen, it culminates in Kun and Zhen. At the inception of yin’s intersection, yang is born—this is Zhen and Kun’s connection to Xun. At the inception of yang’s contraction, yin is born—this is Xun and Qian’s connection to the circular diagram.\n\nThe sequence of yin and yang’s waxing and waning is as follows: Zhen has one yang, Li and Dui have two yang, and Qian has three yang; Xun has one yin, Kan and Gen have two yin, and Kun has three yin—all are the principles of nature. Their numbers proceed from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight, forming the eight trigrams. The round exterior represents yang, while the square within represents yin. The round is dynamic and becomes Heaven; the square is still and becomes Earth. Though the images of square and circle differ, their arrangement of trigrams and sequences are the same across the four diagrams.\n\nThus, it is said that this began with Fuxi, not with Master Shao. Even if Master Shao had created it himself, he would have based it upon Fuxi’s work.\n\nMoreover, the term \"Primordial\" refers to that which precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose it—this is what King Wen and Confucius did not expound. Some say the Primordial is the *River Diagram*. The numbers of the *River Diagram* are: Heaven one, Earth two, Heaven three, Earth four, Heaven five, Earth six, Heaven seven, Earth eight, Heaven nine, Earth ten. The numbers of Heaven are five, and the numbers of Earth are five; the five positions interact, each having its counterpart. The numbers of Heaven total twenty-five, and the numbers of Earth total thirty—altogether, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five, which the sages took as the basis for drawing the trigrams.\n\nSome say the eight trigrams are the *River Diagram*—this is incorrect. Moreover, the sequence of the Primordial trigrams and the *River Diagram* are only half in accord. In the *River Diagram*, Qian and Kun are vertical, while the six children are horizontal—this is the origin of numbers. The Primordial cannot be spoken of in terms of numbers; its sequence and positions are all the generative numbers of the eight trigrams. Yang is one, and yin is two; thus, yang generates yin as two, and six becomes twelve. Yin generates yang as three, and ten becomes thirty. Therefore, Qian begins with one, and Dui becomes twelve; Li becomes twelve and thirty, totaling three hundred sixty; Zhen becomes twelve and four thousand three hundred twenty. From Xun to Kun, all are the generative numbers of odd and even. When refined into the sixty-four hexagrams, they are multiplied by their generated numbers to yield the total sum.\n\nFrom midnight to noon is yang: the first four lines are yang, the two lines before the middle are both yin, the two lines after are both yang, the top line is yin, and the second line is yang.\n\nFrom noon to midnight is yin: the first four lines are all yin; the two lines before the middle are yang; the two lines after are yin; the top line is yang; the second line is yin; the third line is yang; and the fourth line is yin.\n\nIn yang, the two lines at the middle and top first become yin and then yang, for yang is born of yin. In yin, the two lines at the middle and top first become yang and then yin, for yin is born of yang. That its sequence begins with Zhen and ends with Kun is because the waxing and waning of yin and yang constitute its numbers. This is what Master Cai called *Huangji Jingshi* (\"Supreme Principles Governing the World\"), all rooted in the Primordial Heaven. For all numbers arise from one, and the cyclic generative numbers of the sixty-four hexagrams—like the sun, moon, and stars; water, fire, earth, and stone; heat and cold; day and night; flying and walking creatures; grasses and trees—are allotted to the eight trigrams, yielding the numbers of ceaseless generation.\n\nThus, what responds and transforms in goodness are heat and cold, day and night, temperament and form, movement and flight, grasses and trees, colors and sounds, qi and flavors. What corresponds and transmutes in goodness are rain and wind, dew and thunder, movement and flight, grasses and trees, temperament and form, eyes and ears, nose and mouth—all the numbers of Primordial Heaven. In the governance of the world, Heaven possesses yin and yang: the Greater Yang, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, and Lesser Yin. Earth possesses softness and hardness: the Lesser Hard, Lesser Soft, Greater Hard, and Greater Soft. These are the eight trigrams spoken of in the *Yijing*. Therefore, when yin and yang are exhausted, the four seasons are complete; when hardness and softness are exhausted, the four directions are established. The odd and even lines of Heaven and Earth, the numbers nine of yang and six of yin, all arise from the number four. This is what Master Zhu meant by viewing the myriad things as fourfold.\n\nThus, the categories of the sun, moon, and stars all emerge from the transformations of the eight trigrams. The changes of Heaven and Earth unfold through *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*; the changes of human affairs unfold through emperors, kings, hegemons, and lords. *Yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* comprise spring, summer, autumn, and winter, corresponding to birth, growth, harvest, and storage. Emperors, kings, hegemons, and lords comprise the *Yijing*, *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*, corresponding to virtue, the Dao, merit, and effort. Each mutually gives rise to the other, forming sixteen. Sixteen is the number of the four images mutually generating one another. All the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the responses of the myriad things, and the continuities and changes of past and present do not exceed these sixteen. With sixteen, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete. This is what Master Shao meant by the supreme subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity lying in the interval between movement and stillness.\n\nThis is called the learning of the Primordial Heart; the learning of the Manifested Traces follows after. Thus, all diagrams begin from the center, for the myriad transformations and affairs are born of the heart. It is also said that the *Primordial Heaven Diagram* is the circle within. Though the diagram bears no text, my words throughout the day never depart from it. For the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all contained within it. Moreover, the circle represents the numbers of the *Hetu*; the square, the patterns of the *Luoshu*. The \"juggling of pellets\" speaks of the circular images of Primordial Heaven, all following the ebb and flow of yin and yang.\n\nThe winter solstice occupies the midpoint of *zi*, where yang begins in *Fu*. The \"Moon Grotto\" is where *Qian* meets *Xun*, that is, the yang from *Fu* to *Qian*. The \"Heavenly Root\" is where *Kun* meets *Zhen*, that is, the yin from *Gou* to *Kun*. Yang governs humanity; yin governs things. Thus, the five hexagrams from *Qian* to *Xun*—that is, *Gou*—are the \"Moon Grotto\"; the five hexagrams from *Kun* to *Zhen*—that is, *Fu*—are the \"Heavenly Root.\" As for the thirty-six palaces, they accumulate the numbers from *Qian* one to *Kun* eight. The \"Heavenly Root\" corresponds to the winter solstice, midnight, what is called the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOn the left, from the first line of *Zhen* is the winter solstice; the middle of *Li* and *Dui* is the spring equinox; the end of *Qian* is the summer solstice. On the right, from the first line of *Xun* is the summer solstice; the middle of *Kan* and *Gen* is the autumn equinox; reaching the end of *Kun* transitions to the winter solstice. This cycle is endless, for in one year, one month, one day, one hour, there is nowhere this principle does not reside. Its ceaseless circulation: from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin containing yang; from *Fu* to *Qian* is yang dividing yin. Between *Kun* and *Fu* lies the Wuji. From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is before the Wuji; from *Qian* connecting to *Fu* is after the appearance of images. *Qian* and *Kun* intersect to become *Tai*; *Kan* and *Li* intersect to become *Jiji*.\n\n*Qian* is born at *zi*; *Kun* is born at *wu*; *Kan* ends at *yin*; *Li* ends at *shen*, corresponding to the celestial seasons. Yin and yang arise from the two sides; the void in the center is the Taiji. From the winter solstice to the summer solstice is forward movement; from the summer solstice to the winter solstice is reverse movement. Black and white circulate within the single ring, and all becomes spring. Master Zhu said: Among the twenty-eight hexagrams of the *Yijing*, when inverted they form fifty-six hexagrams, except for *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Daguo*, *Yi*, *Xiaoguo*, and *Zhongfu*, which when inverted remain their original hexagrams. Combining the twenty-eight hexagrams with these eight yields the thirty-six palaces. These are all the marvels of the \"Heavenly Root\" and \"Moon Grotto,\" the comings and goings of their endless cycle.\n\nThis *Primordial Heaven* is the original diagram of Fuxi. Though it requires no words, its scope is vast, for every character and meaning in the *Yijing* emerges from it. In terms of its structure, the *Taiji* is not as grand or detailed as *Primordial Heaven*; in terms of its principles, *Primordial Heaven* is not as refined or concise as the *Taiji*. Yet the *Taiji* ultimately lies within the bounds of *Primordial Heaven*, for the principles of things are the same, and images and numbers are without duality.\n\nFrom the first undivided line to the completion of six lines is what is called the learning of Primordial Heaven. After the hexagrams are formed, each is expounded according to its particular meaning—this is the learning of Manifested Traces. What Master Shao called *Primordial Heaven* is the *Yijing* drawn by Fuxi; *Manifested Traces* is the *Yijing* expounded by King Wen.\n\nFuxi’s *Yijing* originally had no text—only a single diagram to embody its images and numbers, within which the principles of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, the transformations of yin and yang from beginning to end, were all contained. The sequence of King Wen’s eight trigrams—*Li* to the south, *Kan* to the north, *Zhen* to the east, *Dui* to the west, *Qian* to the southwest, *Kun* to the northwest, *Gen* to the southeast, and *Xun* to the northeast—represents their positions in application, the learning of Manifested Traces.\n\nThough Confucius composed the *Ten Wings* based on King Wen’s *Yijing*, within them—such as the arrangement of the eight trigrams, their doubling to form hexagrams; the *Taiji*, the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams; and the categories of Heaven, Earth, Mountain, Marsh, Thunder, Wind, Water, and Fire—all derive from Fuxi’s original trigrams, not taking King Wen’s expounded *Yijing* as identical to Fuxi’s initial drawings. Some say this diagram was transmitted from Chen Tuan to Mu Bochang, from Mu to Li Tingzhi, and from Li to Shao Yong, thus sharing its origins with the alchemical Dao.\n\nFrom *Fu* to *Qian* is yang; from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin. *Qian* and *Kun* establish the positions of above and below, while *Li* and *Kan* arrange the gates of left and right—where Heaven and Earth open and close, where the sun and moon enter and exit. After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice, inhalation—this is the yearly breath of Heaven and Earth. The month of the winter solstice follows the path of the summer solstice’s sun; the month of the summer solstice follows the path of the winter solstice’s sun. From spring to summer, from *Zi* to *Chen-Si*; from autumn to winter, from *Wu* to *Xu-Hai*. The four cardinal trigrams are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The four trigrams of the female and male serve as the bolt and key.\" The numbers of *Kan* and *Li* are one and two, forming the warp of the north-south axis. *Kan* and *Li* are the true Water and Fire, the masters of the six trigrams, while the six trigrams serve *Kan* and *Li*.\n\nThe two breaths of yin and yang both originate and conclude at *Zi* and *Wu*. *Kan* conceals the six *Wu* stems as the essence of the moon, residing in the north, symbolizing the White Tiger born of water within metal. *Li* conceals the six *Ji* stems as the radiance of the sun, residing in the south, symbolizing the Vermilion Dragon born of fire within mercury. Beginning with *Zhen* and rising to *Qian*, it reaches fullness; passing through *Xun*, it wanes, and with *Kun*, it is exhausted. The middle line of *Qian* resides within *Kun*, where metal and water share the same origin. The middle line of *Kun* resides within *Qian*, where wood and fire share the same position.\n\n*Qian* gives birth to three daughters, dwelling in the east: above *Xun*, middle *Li*, below *Dui*—two yang producing one yin. *Kun* gives birth to three sons, dwelling in the west: above *Zhen*, middle *Kan*, below *Gen*—two yin producing one yang. The *Kan* embryo resides at *Wu*; the *Li* embryo resides at *Zi*. The west borrows the origin of metal; the east borrows the ancestor of wood. *Qian* retreats to dwell in *Kan*; *Kun* retreats to dwell in *Li*.\n\nIn the method of *Na Jia*: *Qian* corresponds to the full moon, *Kun* to the new moon, while *Kan* and *Li* ascend and descend at the center. Thus, *Qian* embraces *Jia* and *Ren*; *Kun* embraces *Yi* and *Gui*; *Li* embraces *Ji*; *Kan* embraces *Wu*; *Xun* embraces *Xin*; *Zhen* embraces *Geng*; *Dui* embraces *Ding*; and *Gen* embraces *Bing*—all in perfect accord.\n\nWhen *Kun* first transforms into *Zhen*, it is the birth of light, the moon emerging at *Geng*. When it transforms again into *Dui*, it is the first quarter, the moon emerging at *Ding*. When *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, it is the birth of the waning phase, the moon appearing at *Xin*. When it diminishes further into *Gen*, it is the last quarter, its day reaching darkness. At the new moon, *Zhen* receives the tally, and the *Fu* hexagram begins its cycle. *Zhen* receives *Geng* from the west, its image like the *Zhen* trigram embracing *Geng*. On the eighth day, the *Dui* trigram embraces *Ding*. On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is pure yang, and the *Qian* trigram embraces *Jia*. On the sixteenth, the *Xun* trigram embraces *Xin*. On the twenty-third, the *Gen* trigram embraces *Bing*. On the thirtieth, the *Kun* trigram embraces *Yi*. Thus, *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end—this aligns with the firing times of internal alchemy.\n\nZhu Xi, however, treated the *Primordial Heaven* eight trigrams as a single sequence, disregarding the order of lunar phases, yet still aligning them with *Na Jia*. He considered the positioning of Heaven and Earth, the mutual resonance of *Pi* and *Tai*, as correct. Thus, he suggested that Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* might trace its lineage to Chen Tuan’s teachings. Indeed, the arrangement of trigrams in both texts silently accords. Yang begins with *Fu* and culminates in *Qian*; yin begins with *Gou* and culminates in *Kun*. Within a year’s twelve months, a month’s thirty days, or a day’s twelve hours, each completes a cycle of the heavens. The sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines form the numbers of one celestial revolution, with each line governing a single day—all in precise accord with the *Yijing*.\n\nThe world assumes the *Cantong Qi* imitates the *Yijing*, yet who knows that the wonders of yin and yang, without seeking alignment, naturally align? Some claim the *Primordial Heaven* and *Taiji* diagrams emerged simultaneously, yet Zhou Dunyi and Shao Yong never communicated—thus, the two diagrams do not interconnect. Yet whether vast as the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, or minute as the life and death of beings, or distant as the changes of ages past and present, all lie within the principles of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. Is this Shao Yong’s unique insight? From the nebulous and swirling origins of transformation and cyclical return—what Zhu Xi called the \"root source beyond\"—the earlier Confucians had lost its transmission, while those outside the orthodox lineage secretly passed it down as the art of the elixir. Only with Chen Tuan and Shao Yong did it return to the *Yijing*, and its teachings became clear and undeniably true. How could their reverence for this diagram be a small contribution?\n\nYet this trust is not misplaced. If Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan* modeled itself on the *Yijing*, dividing into regions, states, and households, all derived from the number three; Guan Ziming’s *Dong Ji* arranged twenty-seven images; and Sima Guang’s *Qian Xu* employed the number five with fifty-five lines—each sought to emulate the *Yijing* in their own way.\n\nAll these works merely patch together and complete books, yet none grasp the fullness of the Dao. Those who skillfully probe the traces of yin and yang and the mechanisms of creation and transformation—when they observe Heaven and Earth from the perspective of the Supreme Ultimate, then Heaven and Earth, too, are but things. Thus we know that Heaven and Earth arise from the *Yijing*, and the *Yijing* does not originate from Heaven and Earth. If one can fully realize the subtleties of the Supreme Ultimate and the functions of the Prior Heaven, then one may encompass Heaven and Earth, mold and complete the myriad things, and hold creation within oneself. In that case, even the Prior Heaven’s One Qi would cease to exist—how much less could mere words convey it?\n\nThe *River Diagram* originally stems from the *Yijing*, which states: \"The River brings forth the Diagram, the Luo brings forth the Writing; the sages took them as their model.\" The *Xici* likewise says: \"Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The heavenly numbers are five, the earthly numbers are five; the five positions interact and each has its pairing. The heavenly numbers total twenty-five, the earthly numbers thirty—altogether, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five.\" This is how Confucius, using the numbers of the *River Diagram*, explained the workings of transformation and the movements of ghosts and spirits. Specifically, it refers to the numbers by which Heaven One generates Water and Earth Six completes it; Earth Two generates Fire and Heaven Seven completes it; Heaven Three generates Wood and Earth Eight completes it; Earth Four generates Metal and Heaven Nine completes it; Heaven Five generates Earth and Earth Ten completes it.\n\nThe *Gu Ming* states: \"The *River Diagram* is kept in the eastern chamber.\" The *River Diagram* and the Eight Trigrams: when Fuxi ruled the world, a dragon-horse emerged from the River, and he took its markings as his model to draw the Eight Trigrams. The *Record of Rites* says: \"The River brought forth the Horse Diagram; the dragon-horse bore the Diagram and emerged.\" The *Analects* says: \"The River does not bring forth the Diagram.\" Confucius explained: \"The *River Diagram* is the Eight Trigrams.\" Thus it is clear that Fuxi took the Diagram as his model to draw the *Yijing*. How could this be dismissed as false?\n\nThis Diagram emerged before the formation of written records, embodying the natural principles of Heaven and Earth. It encompasses the boundless subtleties of creation and transformation and is the source of the images and numbers of all things and affairs. Zheng Kangcheng said: \"The River flows to connect with Qian, issuing the Heavenly Embrace; the Luo flows to connect with Kun, spouting the Earthly Talisman. The *River Diagram* has nine sections, the *Luo Writing* six.\" Liu Xin said: \"When Fuxi succeeded Heaven to rule, he received the *River Diagram* and took it as his model to draw the Eight Trigrams.\" The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces serve as outer and inner. Wang Su said: \"The *River Diagram* is the Eight Trigrams.\" Wang Chong also said: \"The *River Diagram* emerged from the River’s waters—it is the trigrams of the *Yijing*.\" Guan Ziming said: \"In the *River Diagram*, seven is in front, six behind, eight to the left, nine to the right.\" Liu Mu said: \"The *River Diagram* totals forty-five, arranging the Four Images without mentioning the Five Phases.\" The *Da Dai Li Ji* says: \"Two, nine, four; seven, five, three; six, one, eight.\" Tradition holds: \"Nine treasures, modeled on the markings of a tortoise.\" It also says: \"These are writings from before the Qin.\" Ouyang Xiu said: \"The Diagram is the markings of the Eight Trigrams. A divine horse bore it from the River to present to Fuxi. The Eight Trigrams were not made by man but were bestowed by Heaven.\" Thus, the Eight Trigrams were created by man, while the *River Diagram* was not involved. As for the *River Diagram*, it is indeed said to have been born from a divine horse bearing the Eight Trigrams, emerging from the waters—these are the natural markings of Heaven and Earth. Why must it be attributed to Fuxi’s creation?\n\nWang Anshi said: \"The Diagram reveals the Dao of Heaven; the Writing reveals the Dao of Man.\" That which connects with Heaven is expressed through images; that which centers on Earth is expressed through methods. Cai Shen said: \"From Kong Anguo, Liu Xiang and his son, to Ban Gu, all held that the *River Diagram* was bestowed upon Fuxi and the *Luo Writing* upon Yu. Guan Ziming and Shao Kangjie both regarded ten as the *River Diagram* and nine as the *Luo Writing*. Only Liu Mu’s opinion differed, taking nine as the *River Diagram* and ten as the *Luo Writing*, claiming it originated with Chen Tuan—contradicting the views of other scholars.\" He also said: \"Fuxi merely relied on the *River Diagram* to create the *Yijing*; he did not need to foresee the *Luo Writing* to have it harmonize with it. Yu merely relied on the *Luo Writing* to create the *Hong Fan*; he did not need to trace back to the *River Diagram* to have it correspond with it.\"\n\nThe numbers of the *River Diagram* are even; evenness is quiescent, and quiescence employs movement as its function. Thus, the movements of the *River Diagram* all pair with odd numbers: one pairs with six, two with seven, three with eight, four with nine, five with ten. The *River Diagram* is round in form but square in function; the sages used it to draw the trigrams. Master Cheng said: \"The sages saw the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* and drew the Eight Trigrams. The ancient sages merely selected the most evident of divine things. Even if they had not seen the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, they still would have created the Eight Trigrams.\" Within the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, the central number is five. Extending it to exhaust its numbers, reaching ten, then combines to fifty. The *River Diagram* accumulates to fifty-five; its fifty are all derived from five, yet five alone is the source of the fifty and has no source itself. Thus, if five is left empty, it becomes merely fifty. Furthermore, in fifty-five, five is the center, and the ten are divided into the numbers of old and young yin and yang. The fifty, having no function, are then multiplied—five by ten and ten by five—both yielding fifty.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The round is the stars; the numbers of calendrical reckoning find their omen here. The square is the earth; the methods of dividing lands and arranging wells imitate this.\" The round represents the numbers of the *River Diagram*; the square, the markings of the *Luo Writing*. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen used them together to create the *Yijing*, while Yu and Ji arranged them to compose the *Hong Fan*. Master Zhu said: \"The *River Diagram* aligns with the *Yijing*’s 'Heaven One to Earth Ten' and contains the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth—all are the source from which the *Yijing* emerges.\"\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, the qi of yin and yang, though each has its form, originally bore no numbers. Only with the advent of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* did the fifty-five numbers emerge—odd and even, generation and completion—suddenly manifest and visible.\n\nIn the positions of the *River Diagram*, One and Six share a lineage and dwell in the north; Two and Seven form a fellowship and reside in the south; Three and Eight follow the same path and occupy the east; Four and Nine are companions and stand in the west; Five and Ten keep watch together in the center. This is nothing more than one yin and one yang, one odd and one even, doubling the Five Phases. The *River Diagram* takes the five generative numbers as its foundation, governing the five completion numbers, and places them together in their respective directions—revealing its entirety to humanity and demonstrating the constant essence of its numbers. The *River Diagram* prioritizes the generative numbers, while the ten numbers derive their value from the five, attaching themselves to the generative numbers. The sum of five odd numbers is twenty-five; the sum of five even numbers is thirty. Together, these two make fifty-five.\n\nThe *River Diagram* embodies wholeness, thus culminating in ten, with the positions of odd and even balanced. The void of Five and Ten in the *River Diagram* is the Supreme Ultimate; the twenty odd numbers and twenty even numbers are the Two Modes. That One, Two, Three, Four correspond to Six, Seven, Eight, Nine represents the Four Images.\n\nWu Cheng said: \"The *River Diagram* appeared before Fuxi drew the trigrams, when a dragon-horse emerged from the River, its back bearing these numbers. Its numbers: behind, One and Six; ahead, Two and Seven; left, Three and Eight; right, Four and Nine; center, Five and Ten—five odd and five even numbers paired together. Fuxi observed Heaven and Earth, humans and all things, finding nothing that was not the pairing of yang (odd) and yin (even). Seeing the numbers of the *River Diagram*, he was struck with insight. Thus, he drew one unbroken line to represent yang and one broken line to represent yin. Adding and doubling these, he formed the eight trigrams, then doubled and added again to create the sixty-four hexagrams. This is what is meant by Fuxi drawing the eight trigrams based on the *River Diagram*.\"\n\nThe numbers of the *River Diagram* also occupy five positions, aligning with the circular arrangement of the five celestial palaces of the stars: One and Six in the north, Two and Seven in the south, Three and Eight in the east, Four and Nine in the west, Five and Ten in the center. The *River Diagram* has five positions, each with one odd and one even number—though the numbers total ten, the positions are only five.\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the *River Diagram* was stored alongside the celestial sphere and precious jades in the royal treasury.\n\nChen Tuan said: \"The two diagrams, Five as the constant and the other as the variant—if speaking of the *River Diagram*, then it is the constant and the *Luo Writing* the variant; if speaking of the *Luo Writing*, then it is the constant and the *River Diagram* the variant. Though the two diagrams differ in vertical and horizontal arrangement, they mutually present and reveal one another—this is what is meant by their interweaving as warp and weft.\"\n\nWeng Yong said: \"In the *River Diagram*, the positions of yin and yang take the generative numbers as primary, with the completion numbers paired to them. In the yang direction of the northeast, the odd numbers govern, paired with even; in the yin direction of the southwest, the even numbers govern, paired with odd.\"\n\nHu Yuan said: \"The *River Diagram* divides yin and yang by generation and completion. The five generative numbers of yang govern the five completion numbers of yin, placed together in their directions. Yang within and yin without, generation and completion unite—this is the meaning of harmonious interaction. The *River Diagram*’s number seventeen establishes its form through opposition, thus it is constant.\"\n\nHu Yigui said: \"In the *Luo Writing*, compared to the *River Diagram*, there is only Five but no Ten. Yet the combinations of One and Nine, Two and Eight, Three and Seven, Four and Six encircle and face one another—there is never an absence of Ten. The earlier Confucians deeply investigated the principles of yin-yang creation, exploring the subtle and obscure, and already plumbed the wonders of the *River Diagram*. Yet distinctions between similarity and difference cannot be avoided.\"\n\nLiu Mu said: \"...One and Six in the north, Two and Seven in the south, Three and Eight on the left, Four and Nine on the right, Five and Ten in the center—this is the *Luo Writing*. Wearing Nine and treading One, Three on the left and Seven on the right, Two and Four as shoulders, Six and Eight as feet—this is the *River Diagram*. Thus, Nine is the *River Diagram*, and Ten is the *Luo Writing*.\"\n\nZhang Wenrao, well-versed in Shao Yong’s teachings, also took Nine as the *Diagram* and Ten as the *Writing*. Yet Shao Yong only spoke of round and square, not of the numbers Nine and Ten. He also took Ten as the *River Diagram* and Nine as the *Luo Writing*, aligning with the words of Confucius and Jizi.\n\nSome say that Shao Yong transmitted his teachings through Mu Xiu, and Liu Mu through Zhong Fang—both received them from Chen Tuan. Zhu Xi said: \"Chen Tuan transmitted the *Xiantian Diagram* to Zhong Fang, who passed it to Mu Xiu, who gave it to Li Zhicai, who taught Shao Yong. Zhong Fang also transmitted the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* to Li Gai, who gave them to Xu Jian, who passed them to Fan Kuachang, who taught Liu Mu. Mu Xiu transmitted the *Taiji Diagram* to Zhou Dunyi, who taught the Cheng brothers. The Chengs, following Liu’s teachings and Zhu Xi’s critiques, vehemently refuted them—this is an unchanging judgment for all ages.\"\n\nWei Shi again refuted Zhu Xi, claiming he initially attributed the Nine-*Diagram* and Ten-*Writing* theory to Liu Changmin, falsely ascribing it to Chen Tuan. Jing Shi Jiang Shan later took the *Xiantian* as the *River Diagram*, the Five Phases’ generative and completion numbers as the *Luo Writing*, and the \"Wearing Nine\" arrangement as the Supreme Unity’s descending numbers.\n\nLuo Duanliang once said: \"I received the *River Diagram* from Cai Jitong, who obtained it from a recluse in Shu. Its form resembled a chariot wheel, black and white intermingled, divided into eight parts to form the eight trigrams. The white represented pure yang, symbolizing *Qian*; the black, pure yin, symbolizing *Kun*. The remaining trigrams were formed by gradually diminishing the black and white.\"\n\nXie Fang said: \"I once received the *River Diagram* from an extraordinary person. Its form resembled the eight trigrams, with *Kan* and *Li* inscribed in the center and intersecting, akin to the alchemical arts of *Kan* and *Li*.\"\n\nZhang Heng’s *Qian Zaodu* presents the Nine Palaces’ numbers as the Supreme Unity Diagram, which Liu Mu took to be the *River Diagram*.\"\n\nSome identify the nine- and twelve-number diagrams as the *River Diagram*. Yet how could such diversity and complexity arise? Master Zhu argued that the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* were not to be trusted, a view held since Ouyang Xiu. However, the *Gu Ming*, *Appended Judgments*, and *Analects* all attest to them. Though the numbers transmitted by various scholars for these two diagrams may intersect, they never contradict; whether counting forward or tracing backward, whether arranged vertically, horizontally, or in curves, all follow clear principles—such is the profundity of their explanations.\n\nOuyang Xiu, having never seen the original diagrams, merely relied on commentarial interpretations, dismissing the diagrams as nonexistent and even doubting that the *Appended Judgments* were composed by Confucius. How could he have erred so gravely in his reasoning? The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* encompass the mechanisms of the myriad things’ transformations—what could possibly contravene them? Moreover, the sages indeed used the *River Diagram* to draw the trigrams; can one then equate the *River Diagram* with the eight trigrams? Yet it harmonizes with the *Luo Writing*. The *Luo Writing* and the initial \"one\" to subsequent \"nine\" of the *Great Plan* together comprise the nine categories’ numbers. While rooted in the *Great Plan*, the *Luo Writing* uses the five odd numbers to govern the four even numbers, making odd numbers primary. The one does not pair with four, six, or eight; instead, each adheres to its kind, attaching to the sides of one, three, seven, and nine. The *Luo Writing*’s vertical and horizontal sums total fifteen, while seven, eight, and nine alternately wax and wane. Excluding five and dividing ten, one contains nine, two contains eight, three contains seven, and four contains six—interwoven and interlocked, all align tacitly. Such is the marvel of boundless transformation.\n\nThus, the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* both derive from five, extending to ten, and together form fifty. The *Luo Writing*’s accumulated numbers total forty-five, dispersed externally, dividing yin and yang into old and young. Only five resides at the center, inherently containing the five numbers, thus also totaling fifty. The *Luo Writing* governs change, culminating in nine, with its positions and actualities favoring odd numbers while even numbers are deficient. Yin and yang’s numbers each total twenty. Though their quantities differ, five at the center allows: great yang, gaining five, becomes six; young yin, gaining five, becomes seven; young yang, gaining five, becomes eight; great yin, gaining five, becomes nine. This mirrors the *River Diagram*’s interwoven yin and yang, producing identical generative and completive numbers. The *Luo Writing*’s odd and even numbers oppose each other, just as the *River Diagram*’s dispersed numbers remain ununified; the *River Diagram*’s generative and completive numbers pair, just as the *Luo Writing*’s numbers unite and belong. Hence, earlier scholars regarded the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* as warp and weft, the eight trigrams and nine categories as outer and inner—this is the principle.\n\nThe *Great Expansion*’s number fifty likewise arises from the extension of five, each reaching its ten, combining into fifty—no different in essence. Moreover, both the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* have void centers, embodying the Supreme Ultimate; their odd and even numbers each total twenty, embodying the Two Modes. Their vertical and horizontal sums of fifteen, alternating between seven, eight, nine, and six, embody the Four Images. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* form the four cardinal directions, while *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Xun*, and *Gen* form the four corners—these are the eight trigrams. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*’s circular arrangement, *Qian* culminates at noon, *Kun* at midnight, *Li* at dawn, and *Kan* at dusk. Yang arises at midnight, reaching its zenith at noon; mid-yin arises at noon, culminating at midnight. Yang resides in the south, yin in the north. In its square arrangement, *Qian* begins in the northwest, *Kun* ends in the southeast; yang lies in the north, yin in the south—yet it remains no different from the *River Diagram*’s interwoven odd and even numbers. This is the *Primordial Heaven* as the origin of the alchemical Dao.\n\nThe *River Diagram*’s yang generative numbers are five, the root of the five phases; its yin completive numbers are ten, the foundation of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six each sum to ten—Metal and Water share the same origin; two and eight, three and seven each sum to ten—Wood and Fire share the same body. Together they total fifty-five, divided among the five directions. One and six reside in the north; two and seven in the south; four and nine in the west; three and eight in the east; five and ten at the center. Subtracting the generative numbers, each direction retains its original number—this is the source of the five phases. Further subtracting the completive numbers from each direction’s original number yields the five phases’ essence. Excluding these, each direction retains five numbers, totaling twenty-five—the root of the five phases, symbolizing the earth of *wu*. Repeatedly subtracting the five phases’ essence, the north retains four numbers, symbolizing Metal. Metal inherently generates Water, yet Metal itself arises from Water, like lead emerging from silver—this is the Metal Tiger. Metal born in Water is the Tiger’s generation from Water. The south retains three numbers, symbolizing Wood. Wood inherently generates Fire, yet Wood itself arises from Fire, like mercury congealing upon encountering lead—this is the Wood Dragon. Wood born in Fire is the Dragon’s emergence from Fire. The east retains two numbers, symbolizing Fire. Fire arises from Wood; extracting mercury from cinnabar is Wood Mercury concealed within *Li*, the mother hidden in the child’s womb—this is the seventh return. The west retains one number, symbolizing Water. Water arises from Metal; the qi returns to its origin, like Metal Lead concealed within *Kan*, the child returning to the mother’s womb—this is the ninth return. The void center symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate; the Four Images unite to form ten—this is the wondrous principle of true yin and earth. All are the mechanisms of heaven and earth’s inverted yin-yang generation, harboring unfathomable marvels. How could the calendrical calculations of the Supreme Unity or the astral numbers of directional arrays compare to these?\n\nYet some claim these transmissions originated with *Xiyi*, asserting that the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were originally rendered in circles—thus, after the Three Dynasties, the diagrams and writings lay concealed for over a thousand years, preserved only by the *fangji* practitioners, until their resurgence in the Song. However, the *fangji* merely appropriated their numerical configurations, employing odd and even counts to balance growth and decline, aligning them with the dynamics of punishment and virtue, life and death—nothing more than the foundational techniques of calendrical prognostication and astral divination. That earlier scholars dismissed the *Cantong Qi* as unworthy of esteem may have been an overstatement.\n\nAlas, tradition holds: \"The Yellow River brought forth the *Hetu*, and the sage took it as his model.\" He imitated it to draft the Eight Trigrams—yet the Eight Trigrams are not the *Hetu* itself. Moreover, the *Hetu* emerged in the age of Fuxi, though none among the sages of that era spoke of it. Confucius, too, alluded to it but never explicitly described the diagram. After Confucius, from Guan and Liu onward, interpretations proliferated, each clinging to their own views, yet none reached a definitive conclusion. Nevertheless, Master Zhu’s distinction—ten as the *Hetu*, nine as the *Luoshu*—suffices to resolve the matter. Some identify the *Xiantian* diagram as the *Hetu*; others liken it to a chariot wheel’s black-and-white interplay; still others model it after the Eight Trigrams or claim both the nine- and twelve-point diagrams as the *Hetu*. Such disparate views leave later generations at a loss as to which to follow.\n\nYet the original text of the *Xici* states: \"From Heavenly One to Earthly Ten,\" wherein five serves as the generative mother and ten as the generative child. From one to ten, five occupies its natural, fixed position. The fifteen points resemble celestial constellations—hence the name \"diagram\"—what connection does this bear to fantastical absurdities? What room remains for doubt?\n\nAh, Master Cheng remarked: \"Principle precedes image; image precedes number. Grasp the meaning, and image and number reside within.\" From the moment the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were first inscribed, their significance unfolded through their patterns—reversals and returns, rises and falls, encompassing the hidden and manifest of heaven and earth, the flight of birds and the stillness of plants, the subtlest details without exception. Thus, the *Yijing*’s alignment with the principles of nature and destiny, its embodiment of the Dao of transformation, all rely on images to illuminate principle.\n\nThose who drown in image and number, reducing it to mere divination, fail to seek principle through meaning and stray far from the Dao—such are the scholars of Guo Pu and Guan Lu. Their claim to \"exhaust numbers to determine the world’s images\" and \"manifest images to fix the world’s fortunes\" derives from the movement of spirit and the stirrings of the heart-mind—merely one facet of the whole. If one seeks the *Yijing*’s text through this alone, how can it fully encompass the unity of substance and function, the seamless interplay of manifest and subtle, the doctrines of life and death, the mysteries of the hidden and revealed, and the vast coherence of heaven and earth? To trace the sages’ lineage through such means is something I cannot accept.\n\nThe Dao of nature and destiny is one; scholars need only seek the Dao. If one pursues it at the source of nature and destiny, what remains unseen? Yet if the pursuit lacks diligence, few will perceive it. Han Yu, in his *Inquiry into Nature*, sought to extend the thread of the sages. Though his principles were not fully illuminated, he aimed to broaden them. Through the ages, many have discoursed on nature, but how few have grasped its essence!\n\nYao and Shun embodied it in their nature; Tang and Wu embodied it in their persons—this is the inherent truth of nature. Thus, Yao’s charge to Shun—\"The mind of the Dao is most subtle\"—sufficed to reveal the root of kingly governance. When the Zhou declined, Confucius arose to continue the tradition. His words—\"Nature and the Dao of Heaven,\" \"What completes it is nature,\" \"Each rectifies its nature and destiny,\" \"Know nature, and you know Heaven\"—most keenly express the source of the Dao.\n\nZisi called it \"what Heaven commands is called nature\"; what Heaven bestows upon humanity is nature. To follow this nature is called the Dao. Mencius’ assertion of the goodness of nature aligns with this. The human heart-mind governs nature and emotion, inherently without flaw—this is the nature endowed by Heaven’s mandate. Its possession of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom requires no artifice; this is the goodness that follows. For Heaven’s mandate to things is the goodness of nature, inherently present. Evil arises from the nature of *qi* and material form—this is the nature proximate to one’s constitution. Thus, when moved by external things, stirred by desire, or obscured by habit, distinctions emerge between the wise and the foolish.\n\nYet goodness, like a mirror’s tarnish or water’s turbidity, is but a fleeting cloud over the vast sky. When the tarnish is cleansed, clarity remains; when turbidity settles, purity endures. The inherent goodness cannot be altered. Thus, it is neither augmented in sages nor diminished in fools. Only by fully realizing one’s nature can one remain unmoved by external things, undisturbed by desire, and unobscured by habit. Then, in its utmost emptiness and numinosity, utmost purity and clarity, it shines like the unclouded sky—how could good and evil be conflated?\n\nThus, stillness brings focus, and movement brings uprightness; sincerity establishes and clarity permeates, giving rise to perspicacity. This is the governor of the five senses, the commander of the hundred limbs, the repository of the four beginnings, and the regulator of the seven emotions. In its vastness, nothing lies beyond—here reside the rectitude of nature and destiny, the principles of life and death, the mysteries of the hidden and revealed. In its minuteness, nothing lies within—here are bound the forms of the great and small, the emotions of all beings, the qualities of shape and color.\n\nWhen fully realized, it becomes a Zhou or a Confucius; when perverted, a Jie or a Zhou. In action, it becomes an Yi or a Fu; in purity, a Boyi or a Shuqi; in tranquility, a Yan or a Min—all stand as exemplars of illuminating goodness. Their influence spans generations, enduring without end. In harmony, it becomes ritual and music; in accord, it becomes laws and institutions; in guidance, it becomes the cardinal principles; in regulation, it becomes canonical norms.\n\nAll that accords with Heaven’s order and sequence—is this not the public function of Heavenly principle?\n\nMoreover, Yangzi’s claim that good and evil are mixed refers only to the biases of emotions, habits, and qi-quality, not to Heaven’s true mandate. Gaozi’s assertion that \"life is what is meant by nature\" makes all that emotions desire and enact part of nature. Xunzi’s claim that \"nature is evil\" treats goodness as artificial. These views, which fixate on emotions, habits, and qi-quality as the essence of true nature, diverge widely from it. Hanzi’s division into three grades posits that nature comprises three grades of the five emotions, while the seven emotions constitute what nature commands—how vast and multifarious are Heaven’s endowments! Yet how can one establish a foundation from such confusion? All that issues from nature is emotion. How can it be confined to three grades, or further burdened with five natures? These are merely the biases of qi-quality.\n\nLater scholars, noting that such discussions had become rare since the Qin and Han, revived them with particular emphasis. Ouyangzi claimed that \"unity of nature is not an urgent concern for scholars, nor a topic the sages seldom addressed\"—how could the great root remain so obscure? Dongzi said: \"Mandate is Heaven’s decree; nature is life’s substance; emotion is human desire; the Dao is the path to governance; benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are its instruments.\" Wangzi said: \"Nature is the Supreme Ultimate of the Five Constants, yet the Five Constants cannot be called nature—this comes close to the Dao.\" Yet some depart from Mengzi’s teachings and align with Xun and Han, how misguided! They simply fail to distinguish clearly.\n\nOnly Master Zhou said: \"Nature at rest is what is called sageliness.\" Master Cheng said: \"What Heaven bestows is mandate; what things receive is nature; nature is principle.\" This is truly luminous. Only Zhou and Cheng can be considered Mengzi’s true successors. Their surpassing of the other masters is evident.\n\nYet what of the divergences in the teachings of Laozi and the Buddhists? Laozi said: \"Nature is spirit, the primordial, indestructible numen.\" The Buddha said: \"Nature is awareness, the fullness of original emptiness and numinosity.\" Only by severing worldly affairs and eliminating desires can one avoid defilement, achieve purity, and establish firmness—thus accumulating numinous clarity into manifest spiritual transformation. Yet this treats all things in heaven and earth with form and qi as illusory and empty. Is this not to lose the reality of principle and qi in emptiness and nothingness? As for their exclusive focus on life and death or personal cultivation, how do they differ from the paths of Shen Buhai, Han Fei, or Yang Zhu?\n\nYet the Way of Heaven and humanity is one. The Dao in its utmost purity and essence, principle in its utmost subtlety and profundity—if humans cannot walk alongside heaven and earth without transgression, it is only because they fail to distinguish between Heavenly principle and human desire. Thus they cannot fully realize the hearts of sages and worthies. One who fully realizes the heart fully realizes nature and attains the Dao of mandate.\n\n**On Spirits**\nSomeone asked: \"Daoist lineages take spirits as their concern—do they truly exist?\"\nI replied: \"Who says they do not? The confusion arises only from imprecise distinctions. Heaven is accumulated qi; earth is the denser aspect of qi—these are the formless. Within the movement of yin and yang lies the flowing operation of Heaven’s mandate. Since this flow is ceaseless, there must be something that governs it.\" Master Cheng said: \"That which governs is called the Emperor; its wondrous function is called spirits.\" He also said: \"Spirits are the traces of creation, the inherent capacity of the two qi.\" The workings of yin and yang are invisible, yet their principles can be inferred. Where principle manifests or withdraws beyond perception, the numinous resides. Thus even the sages never denied their existence—they simply did not dwell on them exclusively.\n\nConfucius said: \"Sacrifice to the spirits above and below as if they were present\"; \"The Way of spirits is to be revered and kept at a distance\"; \"The virtue of spirits is most perfect.\" He did not deny their existence—he merely refrained from speaking of anomalies, force, disorder, or spirits, lest people become mired in absurdity. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the numinous,\" and \"Spirits unite with good and ill fortune\"—this is the meaning.\n\nWhen the heart is preserved, the Dao becomes clear and principle manifest. The mechanism of yin and yang, its issuing and entering, coming and going, is none other than our own heart. Its good and ill fortune are one with spirits—without spirits, they cannot endure. What then can be said of good and ill fortune? Only those who manifest the Dao and embody numinous virtue can unite with it to penetrate the power of spiritual clarity. Thus \"transforming through greatness is called sageliness; sageliness beyond comprehension is called the numinous\"—this is what is meant by \"subtly pervading all things as the numinous.\" The Dao of exhausting the numinous and knowing transformation is fully realized here.\n\nThe sage embodies the wondrous function of heaven and earth, uniting the ultimate achievement of heaven and humanity. Only then does one become numinous without knowing how—this is the numinous. Thus it is said: \"Serving Heaven is illumination; serving Earth is discernment.\" Only by sincerely aligning the heart to move Heaven can Heaven respond through its mechanism. That which is invisible and unknowable is called the numinous presence. Though \"the workings of Heaven above are soundless and scentless,\" resonance here elicits response there—never interrupted.\n\nThus even the wicked, if they fast, bathe, and purify themselves, can serve the Supreme Emperor and spirits. Offerings are accepted through sincerity—knowing sincerity is sufficient to serve Heaven. In sacrificial rites, the burning of reeds and fat reports to the luminous; millet, rice, liver, and lungs, combined with aromatic herbs, report to the corporeal. All arise from the resonance of qi.\n\nAs for the numinous in the manifest world: thunder and drums, wind and rain, frost and dew—its obscurity and brightness, transformations and fleeting myriad forms—if not the work of the supremely numinous, what else could achieve this?\n\nThe hidden as ghosts cannot be traced or sought. Yet when the mournful cries of fish and the desolate rustling of reeds gather—whether in sound or form, whether through resonance of qi or the arrival of thought—what is lofty has no shape, what is lowly has substance: these are the stagnant and untransformed, the bent and unextended. This is what is meant by \"essence-qi becomes things, wandering souls become transformations,\" constrained by the contraction and expansion of yin and yang. Thus the yang-essence and yin-corporeality reveal the true nature of ghosts and spirits.\n\nObserve the traces of creation, and the origins of being and non-being become clear.\n\nSomeone asks: The principle of existence is certain, yet when people in the world suffer illness, they say it is the harm of some ghost or spirit, and only by offering blood sacrifices and prayers can they be spared. If the prayers are answered, they clamor to declare the spirit’s efficacy. If unanswered, and a sudden change in life or death occurs, they resentfully claim some ghost has invaded, and the spirit has aided it. Yet when they seek the object of their prayers, it is often not a spirit that Heaven, Earth, or the altars of state should properly worship—these are all excessive cults, unworthy even of the name \"spirit,\" let alone capable of aiding ghosts to violate the Mandate of Heaven. Is this not the height of folly?\n\nThis has not arisen overnight. It is the custom of streets and alleys, where common men and foolish women are deluded by vulgar talk, startling the world and shocking the public, until it becomes a prevailing wind. If one but understands that the living are the numinous presence of qi, the dead are the contraction of qi; the extended become spirits, the contracted become ghosts; the ethereal soul belongs to Heaven, the bodily form to Earth—how could perverse and deviant beliefs still deceive?\n\nThose who preserve the purity and sincerity of their hearts, uniting their power with Heaven and Earth, may achieve feats like Lu Yang, who reversed his spear to halt the sun, or the chaste widow whose weeping brought down frost, or Master Han, who parted the clouds of Mount Heng and drove away the ravenous crocodiles. As the early Confucians said: \"Where there is sincerity, there is spirit; without sincerity, where does spirit reside?\"\n\nThose who daily invoke ghosts and spirits merely awaken the numinous clarity and undivided essence within themselves, aligning with the numinous transformations of Heaven and Earth. This is what Master Dong meant by \"releasing the yang and restraining the yin.\" The *Shenyi* says: \"The qi of prior Heaven is the true imperial law; the spirit of my heart is the thunder official and mountain count.\" This is likely what it means.\n\nThose who dismiss this as esoteric doctrine without examining it—do they truly understand the workings of numinous transformation or the changes of ghosts and spirits?\n\nWhen Mangmiaozi of Zhixing wandered through mountains and marshes, he saw trees: the tall ones twisted and gnarled, the low ones lush and thriving; the crooked ones coiled, the straight ones towering and dense. Some were several feet in girth, others no thicker than a finger. Flourishing and verdant, they filled the cliffs and ravines, valleys and gorges, while clouds and mist rose and fell with them, and birds nested in their branches, singing in harmony.\n\nTurning with a smile, he said: \"I have always loved the lush vitality of things, and none embody it more than plants. Those that soar on wings, glide with scales, or run on legs—are they not all endowed with their own nature? Yet the principle of plants is most visible and delightful. Consider the succession of the four seasons: every flower and blade of grass, whether red or purple, white or yellow, does not miss its time or lose its color. Cold and heat respond to the seasons, and buds and shoots emerge in due course. Their dazzling hues and competing beauty cannot be captured by brocade or cosmetics. Spring cannot make them bloom in winter, nor summer make them flourish in autumn. The swift cannot be hastened, nor the slow forced to delay. Even when planted in halls or cultivated in pots, their branches bent to fit their containers, their natures harmonized to suit their care—though it may seem they cannot follow their Heaven-given nature, and their essence is harmed by constraint and narrowness, yet they do not know their own injury. In the end, they die, but if they await their time and follow the seasons, they will bloom and flourish again. Who, then, makes this so? It is the work of the Master of Creation.\"\n\nHere the subtlest and most wondrous is thus revealed, for each thing is endowed with its own nature, each possessing its own singularity—what is meant by \"each thing containing one Supreme Ultimate.\" Yet their nurture depends on the timely arrival of conditions. Thus, if their essence is not depleted nor their growth suppressed, there is nothing strange in this principle.\n\nConsider the mountains and marshes: beyond the reach of manure and soil, beyond the touch of irrigation. Whether moistened by rain and dew, assailed by frost and snow, or subjected to untimely dryness or dampness, uneven cold or heat—without distinction of fragrance or foulness, all rely solely on the nourishment of wind and rain, the steadfastness of earth and stone. Yet the tall and the low, the crooked and the straight, the great and the small—each follows its inherent nature, flourishing and thriving without limit. Those that fully realize the completeness of their endowed nature, though mere mountain blossoms or wild herbs, vie in fragrance and beauty, yielding nothing to those in pots and urns, and far surpassing any single flower or blade of grass.\n\nThus, pines, cedars, and camphor suffice for beams and pillars; catalpa, camphor, and nanmu suffice for corners and edges. Their resin can become oil or lacquer; their withered parts, vessels or firewood. Their sweet fruits are edible; their fine roots, medicinal. Their auspicious blackness can be recorded. Each adapts to its material, yet none are born in deep mountains or hollow forests merely because they are deemed useless—thus preserving their original nature. Each fulfills its singular nature, and those that fully receive Heaven remain beyond constraint. How vast and wondrous is this!\n\nThe Dao in the world is like water flowing through the earth, reaching everywhere without exception. How can plants and trees, devoid of sentiment or knowledge, achieve such harmony? Now I comprehend the principle that the myriad things share one root—a truth constant through ancient and modern times, filling the cosmos and unchanging. I know not the extremity of my joy.\n\nOne who laughed afterward asked: \"Why do you delight in this observation?\"\nI replied: \"It is not for you to know. In observing the nature of plants, I exhaust my own nature—how could I not rejoice?\"\n\nThe one who laughed said: \"What you observe are merely the places where you wander and rest, the sights your eyes have beheld. How can you know the lush verdure of trees, their cycles of prosperity and decline, their waxing and waning with the seasons? These do not occur in a single day. Were they not secluded in the perilous wilds of mountains, they would daily contend with bandits, suffer the calamity of axes, with no regard for age or weakness, crookedness or straightness, hardness or brittleness, size or smallness. Buffeted by wind and frost, felled by ice and snow, they are hewn day and night—carved into boats, bent into mats, chiseled into dwellings, severed for carts, broken for firewood—countless fates. All are harmed by their clarity, destroyed by their substance. Thus, the nature of trees is ruined—what vitality remains to observe? Only what Zhuangzi called the 'gnarled and deformed' mountain trees, which by chance preserve their natural lifespan, may survive. As for those long and great, like lattice and pillars, I have never seen them. You do not choose to depart but instead gaze upon them daily, as Mencius said of Ox Mountain’s trees, once beautiful. Yet how, when felled day after day, can their nature not be harmed, just as one’s own nature is severed without awareness? This applies not only to trees.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Even in wood, stone, tiles, and pebbles, each has its fixed principle.\" What sorrow remains? For the nature endowed in things cannot be harmed. Their suitability for use is a matter of fortune or misfortune—this is their destined lot. Thus, the finest timber, fit for zithers and flutes, is offered in the ancestral temple; the sturdiest, fit for trays and mats, graces halls and chambers. The inferior is placed in lowly quarters; the rotten, cast into dust. Each follows its fate—yet who can destroy or sever that which fully realizes its Heaven-given nature? This is what it means to exhaust one’s nature.\n\nThe one who laughed said: \"Indeed.\"\n\n*Reading the \"Observing Things\" Chapter*\nWhen the books of Confucius and Mencius appeared, their Dao was illuminated. As their Dao faded, royal governance declined. It was not that the books were lost, but that those who spoke of the Dao failed to clarify it. From the Warring States onward, even in the prosperous ages of Han and Tang, those who knew and practiced it were few. With the rise of the Song, the Dao became manifest. Master Zhou elucidated the uncharted depths of the Supreme Ultimate, while Master Shao revealed the infinite principles of the Primordial Heaven. Through them, the teachings of Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius—long severed—were revived. No revival was greater than this.\n\nThe Dao of the sages originates in the heart—*The Book of Changes* is the study of the heart. Master Shao said: \"The heart is the Supreme Ultimate. To study is to cultivate the heart.\" The study of Primordial Heaven is the study of the heart. His words on the heart reached their zenith; his discourse on principle was luminous. His circular and square diagrams exhaust the wonders of *The Book of Changes*. Though vast as Heaven and Earth, subtle as yin and yang, mysterious as ghosts and spirits, profound as images and numbers, the transformations of being and non-being, the boundlessness of things, the divinity of principle—all emerge from the Supreme Ultimate and return to it, gathered within the single heart. Expanding, it fills the cosmos; contracting, it dwindles to the finest hair. Its purity, refinement, depth, and subtlety are truly detailed and precise.\n\nThis is what he meant by \"observing with the heart\" and \"observing with principle.\" He also said: \"Do not observe things with the heart, nor with the self, nor with things themselves.\" Consider the successions of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang—differing in virtue, merit, exile, and execution; the durations of Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu—varying in length. The choice lies solely in good and evil.\n\nThus we know that order and chaos arise from what is esteemed as righteousness or profit, while deviance and rectitude follow from words and deeds. All the affairs of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons—like a mirror’s reflection in water—reveal even the finest detail without concealment. In turning inward to observe, this is what is meant by the sage’s ability to unify the feelings of the myriad things. This is the Way of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching destiny.\n\nExpanding to its utmost, the numbers of heaven and earth, yin and yang, arise naturally from the formless One, and the non-acting One serves as the model for the Dao. There are three applications of this, corresponding to heaven, earth, and humanity. Thus it is said: before the Ultimate of Non-being, yin contains yang; after the appearance of images, yang divides yin. The cycles of the Celestial Root and the Lunar Grotto reside within the inquiry into the Ultimate of Non-being. How could this not align with Master Zhou’s teachings?\n\nSince the *Yijing* appeared, later commentators have numbered in the thousands, yet how many have truly grasped the sage’s intent prior to the first hexagram line? Yet those who admire such teachings merely seek the leisurely pleasures of seclusion, remaining ignorant of the Way itself. When Han Yu read Xunzi, he took what was closest to Confucius and deemed Yang Xiong a disciple of the sages. Comparing *Tai Xuan* to the *Yijing*, Shao Yong called pre-cosmic learning the study of the heart, and post-cosmic learning the study of traces—movement between being and non-being, life and death, is the Dao. To seek it through cunning calculations and shortcuts is to bend heavenly principle to serve human desire. How vastly distant is such a view!\n\nThis is sufficient to show that his vision was most expansive, his knowledge most far-reaching, his discourse most lofty, his joy most great. He could engage in matters of utmost breadth, depth, height, and magnitude while remaining empty within. Could this not be the work of one most divine and sagely? Truly, it is no falsehood.\n\nWho among those who nurture the heart well could speak of the learning of the heart with him? Alas! Some say that beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss. Yet Shao Yong may be called one who exhausts the divine and knows transformation. Could this be what the sage did not discuss?\n\nReading the *Biography of Dong Zhongshu*, I observe that after the Three Dynasties, the Zhou declined and the Kingly Way ceased. Qin inherited the practices of the Warring States, its qi dissipated and its ambitions perverse. It burned the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* to ashes, and the transmission of the Dao was nearly extinguished without a trace. When Han arose and the world was greatly ordered, its corrupt scholars and petty officials still clung to old habits, unable to revive the teachings of the former kings from their remnants. Emperor Wen was called a worthy ruler, yet even he failed to employ Jia Yi. A thousand years later, reading Jia’s words still evokes sorrow and indignation—how much more so for those unlike Jia Yi!\n\nDong Zhongshu, lowering his curtain to lecture and recite, did not glance at his garden for three years. In his comings and goings, he moved only in accord with ritual. Scholars all revered him as a teacher. When Emperor Wu sought worthy and learned men, Zhongshu responded with his memorial. At that time, the meeting of ruler and minister was something Qin could never have hoped for. His words were sufficient to expose the flaws of the Zhou decline and restore the correctness of the Kingly Way, with benevolence, righteousness, music, and ritual as its foundation. His distinctions between nature and destiny, feelings and substance, and his discourses on yin and yang, punishment and virtue were incisive.\n\nFrom this we see that in the interaction between heaven and humanity, when ritual and propriety are cultivated in the person, good and evil move heaven. The unceasing transmission from Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang was due to upholding the single Way without the flaws of exhausted governance. How could the mediocre men of Qin and Han ever attain this? Though Emperor Wu was resolute and decisive, after three memorials he still could not implement Zhongshu’s teachings in the slightest, instead sending him to serve as Chancellor of Jiangdu. Was this not a cause for lament in that era?\n\nTake Gongsun Hong, who curried favor to gain power, obtaining a marquisate through classical studies, yet he envied upright discourse and banished Zhongshu to Jiaoxi. Though Zhongshu could not promote his Way, he rectified himself to lead his subordinates, serving two arrogant kings while maintaining their respect. He ultimately retired to complete his studies and writings at home—was this not the perfect embodiment of the Way of advancement and withdrawal?\n\nHis words declared: \"Rectify your judgment without scheming for profit; clarify the Way without calculating its effects.\" Only with the emergence of the Cheng brothers in the Song was this teaching fully elucidated, becoming a model for later generations. At that time, even Ban Gu, Jia Yi, Liu Xiang, and Yang Xiong could not compare—how much less those who came after!\n\nSima Qian wrote that Liu Xiang praised Zhongshu’s talent, saying even Yi Yin and Lü Shang could not surpass him, while Guan Zhong and Yan Ying barely matched him. This was excessive. Liu Xiang’s words were mistaken. Had Zhongshu met a ruler who practiced his Way, would he not have achieved the accomplishments of Yi Yin and Lü Shang? How could Guan and Yan even compare? For Guan and Yan were merely aides to hegemons, capable only of hegemonic affairs—how could they match the greatness of the Kingly Way?\n\nMoreover, considering the depth of his teacher-student lineage, he still fell short of Ziyou and Zixia. Yet when Master Zhou Dunyi revived the lost learning and promoted the Way in the Song, scholars to this day all follow him—the Dao has never perished. How could his lineage be considered flawed? Had Sima Qian seen this, would later generations not have failed to understand Zhongshu? Yet some who recognized his worth sought to enshrine him in the temple and offer sacrifices alongside Confucius, to perpetuate the illumination of Confucius’ teachings and the suppression of the Hundred Schools. But this was never carried out—was this not regrettable?\n\nYet the Dao and words of Zhongshu do not depend on sacrificial offerings. How difficult it is to meet with true understanding! Across a hundred generations, the same holds. Even Emperor Wu of Han, with all his wisdom, cast him aside and did not employ him—how much less those beneath him? There is no cause for surprise.\n\n*Postscript to the Orthodox Lineage of Literary Works*\nThe qi of the Three Luminaries and Five Peaks issues forth as literature, and literature is the vessel for conveying the Dao.\n\nWhen literature flourishes, the Dao is thereby illuminated—yet it must be rooted in qi. The primordial qi courses through Heaven and Earth, and thus the Dao is established. The ancients of virtue invariably left behind words, for their harmony and compliance accumulated within, and their brilliance manifested without. Without the Dao being full and virtue being luminous, how could this be expressed in words? Thus, the *Orthodox Lineage of Literary Works* compiled by the True and Loyal Duke was precisely to preserve those of correct source and flow—hence the name *Orthodox Lineage*. Its arrangement comprises four categories: first, diplomatic correspondence; second, discourses and treatises; third, narrative accounts; and fourth, poetry and rhapsodies. Only the writings of the Yu and Xia dynasties, the Warring States, the Western Han, and the early Tang—rooted in the *Zuozhuan*—were included. Thereafter, those deemed worthy of emulation—Ban [Gu], Sima [Qian], Han [Yu], and Liu [Zongyuan]—were followed by Ouyang [Xiu], Su [Shi], Zeng [Gong], and Wang [Anshi], while the rest were excluded. Its standards and distinctions were stringent, for it took morality as its foundation, principle and righteousness as its essence, and required that what was expressed in literary form must first attain the correctness of human nature and feelings before it could be deemed fitting. Viewed thus, even among the words of the ancients, those truly in accord are exceedingly rare. How much less could those who fail to grasp this, yet recklessly call their work \"literature,\" hope to align with the masters? Such a goal is unattainable. Yet this is only because their Dao remains unmanifest and their qi unfulfilled.\n\nLearning serves to exhaust principle and achieve practical use, and it must be rooted in the Dao and cultivated through qi. When one knows what to cultivate, qi becomes full and the Dao is established—how could one’s writing then fail to be masterful? I have devoted myself to literature for over twenty years, seeking its essentials. Below the Six Classics, I have savored the works of the Han and Tang masters, aspiring to trace the words of the Three Dynasties and explore how they correspond to the Classics as their inner and outer expressions. Yet I am ashamed that my learning remains weak and sluggish, lacking breadth, depth, and integration—this is my constant fear. Only upon studying this compilation have I gained clarity and insight, deepening my conviction and expanding my understanding. Even if one’s path is not yet correct or one’s cultivation not yet perfected, and thus unworthy of inclusion, this too becomes distinctly discernible.\n\nAlas, how few in the world comprehend this! They prize mere ornamentation, embellishment, triviality, and decadence, regarding this work as distant as a thousand *li* or as perilous as a ten-thousand-*ren* cliff. Who among them realizes that without first following the proper path, one cannot reach the destination? Even those who seek the threads of its source and flow amid the essence and refinement—if they pursue it without guidance—how could they fail to grasp the residual intent of the Loyal Duke? And for those who have the honor of continuing his legacy, how could they not count themselves fortunate?\n\n---\n\n**On Distinguishing the *Xunzi***\n\nThe *Xunzi*, in thirty-three chapters, begins with *Encouraging Learning* and *Cultivating the Self*, grounding itself in the words of Confucius. *The Efficacy of the Ru*, *The Way of the Ruler*, *The Way of the Minister*, *Kingship and Hegemony*, and *Rites and Music* follow, seemingly grasping the beginnings of the kingly way—yet interspersed with debates on enriching the state and strengthening the military. It explicitly declares the inherent evil of human nature as untreatable, all derived from its fundamental premise. By falsely invoking Yao and Shun and rejecting Zisi and Mencius, it paved the way for Li Si’s destruction of Qin and the pernicious habits of the Warring States—how could these be escaped? Li Si studied under Xunzi, and Li Si’s downfall reveals the nature of Xunzi’s teachings.\n\nAt that time, Mencius engaged with Xunzi in debate, yet we never hear from Wan Zhang or his disciples what Mencius’ words on this matter truly were. Had Mencius spoken of the goodness of human nature and first addressed King Hui of Liang with the words, \"There is nothing but benevolence and righteousness,\" then even if his teachings were insufficient for his own era or for ten thousand generations, how far would Xunzi’s words have been from the harm wrought by Yang Zhu and Mo Di? Han Yu claimed that Xunzi \"promoted the Dao in an era when it was no longer transmitted,\" yet he spoke of it only in passing without elaboration. Was this truly because he had no time to refute the resentment of Xunzi’s doctrine of inherent evil, or was there something he did not fully understand? Perhaps he did not necessarily regard Xunzi’s words as inferior to Mencius’—or did he simply lack sufficient conviction?\n\nMoreover, during the reign of King Xiang of Qi, Xunzi was revered as a venerable Confucian master—was there truly no one capable of debating the distinction between kingship and hegemony with him, yet all deferred to him as their teacher? Was this not because they were swayed by his rhetoric, such as his discourse on Duke Ai’s question to Yao, using it to dazzle and entice? Or was it because they were drawn to his techniques of divination, shamans, and belief in omens? Thus, later generations knew only the elegance of his words but rarely scrutinized them.\n\n---\n\n**On the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence***\n\nHistorians speak of the \"Yellow and Lao\" as sharing the same Dao, yet the words of the Yellow Emperor himself are nowhere to be seen. As for the *Liezi*’s attribution of books to the Yellow Emperor, they largely align with Laozi’s teachings. Among transmitted texts, only the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* is claimed as a work of the Yellow Emperor. Its language is plain yet refined, profound yet essential—could such a text have been produced by anyone other than one who embodied the Dao?\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, Li Quan obtained it from Mount Song, stating that it had been hidden by Kou Qianzhi during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei. Li Quan said: \"A hundred words expound the Dao, a hundred words expound the law, and a hundred words expound the technique. The Dao pertains to immortals embracing the One; the law pertains to enriching the state and pacifying the people; and the technique pertains to strengthening the military and achieving victory.\" Yet in its phrasing and meaning, all three are invariably present.\n\nShao Yong considered it a Warring States text, while the Cheng brothers believed it could not have been written later than the end of the Shang or the end of the Zhou—certainly predating the Qin. For in the era of the former kings, when the sagely Dao was luminous, none dared to propagate heterodox teachings. But as the Zhou declined and the Dao became obscured, men of talent and intelligence rarely knew where to turn, so each relied on their own insights to speculate and establish their doctrines. Some orthodox teachings may have been impure or inconsistent, yet this text alone employs paradoxical language that aligns with orthodoxy—it must have been deliberately chosen.\n\nIts great essence takes \"ultimate non-being\" as its宗, and the patterns of Heaven and Earth as its reckoning. It declares that all phenomena in the world arise from non-being, and that if one can return from being to non-being, all is well.\n\nAnd Master Zhu [Xi] once remarked that this book might well have been written by Guan Yin—yet since Guan Yin was not profoundly versed in the Dao, it is certain that he could not have attained such depth. Cheng [Yi] and Shao [Yong] held it to be a text from the Shang or Zhou dynasties, and if it predates the Qin, then even the Tang masters could not have matched it. Is this not because Confucians avoid speaking of immortals and thus insist it was not written by the Yellow Emperor? Yet Master Zhu’s commentary, though it notes the text’s obscurity and convoluted phrasing, risks leading readers to see only its complexity and miss its unity.\n\nMoreover, to observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the workings of Heaven—one who can do so becomes one body with Heaven and Earth, and the Dao resides within. This is the root of the entire scripture. The principle of human nature and the human mind is one, yet their manifestations in the realm of mechanism are two. Establishing the Dao of Heaven to stabilize its mechanism, one finds that excess movement gives rise to transformation and reversal, and thus Heaven and humanity act in unison. Only by establishing the Dao to stabilize it can the foundations of the myriad transformations be secured, and movement and stillness naturally find their constancy. Even the path of cultivation and refinement may be understood thereby.\n\nAs for the Five Thieves, the Nine Orifices, the Three Essentials, generation and destruction, and mutual restraint—all arise from those who steal the mechanism, and once such theft is rectified, the Three Powers [Heaven, Earth, and Humanity] are at peace. The noble person remains steadfast in adversity and dares not act recklessly, while the petty person treats life lightly and invites calamity. For what cannot be seen or known—is this not the very essence of the ineffable and numinous? Thus sagely achievement arises from this, and divine illumination emerges therefrom.\n\nTherefore, the threefold return through day and night restores one’s original state. Severing profit to guard the source, one transcends the distinction between day and night, life and death. With ears that hear well though blind and eyes that see well though deaf, the mind becomes single-minded, and its strategic power increases tenfold. Thus Heaven’s great benevolence arises from non-benevolence, and perfect impartiality resides in the utmost partiality. Life and death, benefit and harm—the Dao is no different in any case, for all are the natural principles of the cosmos.\n\nOnly those who attain the utmost joy and stillness can unite with the Dao of the threefold return, thereby moving and resting to rediscover it. What they perceive are the patterns of Heaven and Earth. Others see them as sages, yet my own grasp of the patterns of phenomena and seasons has never differed from that of Heaven and Earth—this is why it is called wisdom. Thus the foolish seek to deceive the sage with cunning, while I alone do not deceive the sage with foolishness, nor do I seek to make the sage appear extraordinary.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of spontaneity is still, and from it Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, so when yin and yang prevail, they push one another, and transformation proceeds in order. Moreover, Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things through perfect stillness, and their Dao grows gradually, so hardness and softness prevail, yin and yang push one another, and transformation is inexhaustible. Within this perfect stillness lies the Dao of spontaneity. The ceaseless generation of the myriad things—this is the marvelous vessel of Heaven and Earth. Even the calculations of musical temperament, calendrics, and hexagrams cannot fathom it, for it is the numinous mechanism hidden like a ghost.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle, as in Shao Yong’s theory of \"inserting the heavenly stems,\" are all techniques of yin and yang prevailing over one another—these can be used to construct hexagram images. Their beginning and end, their patterns, are never disconnected. Yet the versions of the text transmitted by Master Chu [Yunü] and Master Cai [Yong] conclude with \"the patterns of phenomena and seasons, wisdom,\" while the twenty-one sentences that follow are what Master Zhu [Xi] deeply valued. Thus the versions of Master Chu and Master Zhang [Zai] are the correct ones. Extending this reasoning, though the division into three chapters may be said to address distinct matters, it is only by illuminating the essence and extending its application—by establishing the essence so that its function may operate—that one can grasp the mechanism of movement and stillness, the discourse on life and death. Those who cannot do so cannot attain this.\n\nIt is certain that this is not the Yellow Emperor’s book, but must have been written by a reclusive gentleman of the Shang or Zhou dynasties. How could one be partial to the Dao, partial to techniques and doctrines? Thus concludes the first volume of *Xianquan Ji*.\n\n[Textual notes: In the phrase *yì pào yān*, the character *pào* is suspected to be a misprint for *yì*. The character *mǎ* appears to be an error and should be corrected to *yān*. In the phrase *dúlì chí xíng ér bù gǎi zhě yě*, *chí* is likely a misprint for *tè*. The character *gǔ* should be corrected to *sú*. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian: The Grand Scribe’s Autobiography*, *xiǎo* should be corrected to *shǎo*.]\n\n*Xianquan Ji*, Volume Two\nWritten by the Non-Action Heavenly Master of Mount Qi, Zhang Yuchu\n\n**Preface to *The Veritable Record of the Primordial Supreme***\n\nThe establishment of the Dao as a teaching begins before Heaven and Earth, and its end remains unknown even after their formation. Its origins trace to the Most High, though the world transmits only that during the Yellow Emperor’s time, it was known as Master Guangcheng. The Emperor once sought the Dao at Mount Kongtong, later casting a tripod to refine the elixir before ascending on high.\n\nYet when examining the records and other texts, they all state that he was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of the Royal Archives in Zhou, later becoming the Archivist of the Treasury. After eighty-odd years—though Sima Qian claims over two hundred—he was known as a reclusive gentleman, posthumously styled *Chi*. Confucius once traveled to Zhou to inquire of him about ritual. When Zhou declined, he departed for Qin, passing through Hangu Pass, where the magistrate Yin Xi, having observed the qi, welcomed him and urged him to write. Thus, he composed the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls to transmit to the world.\n\nAccording to genealogical records, some say he was Li Qian of the Zhou, whose wife, a daughter of the Yishou clan named Yingfu, bore a son named Er, styled Boyang. Others claim the Li clan descended from Gaoyang’s son Tingjian, who served as Grand Judge under Yao and took the surname *Li* from his office. Later, Li Zheng’s wife, Qie of the He clan, fled punishment under Zhou and survived by eating the fruit of the *li* tree, hence changing their name to *Li*. Still others say Li Lingfei attained the Dao, and his wife, Lady Yin, gave birth to Laozi, whose personal name was Hongyuan, styled Yaoling, also called Boyang, Lao Laizi, or Grand Scribe Dan. The accounts vary.\n\nAs for the Yellow Emperor’s predecessors, they existed from the very beginning of the Three Sovereigns’ era, and the transmission of their divine transformations has continued unceasingly across hundreds of millennia. Thus, the compilation of this *Veritable Record* must have its basis.\n\nThe spirit knows no bounds—it may precede or follow, exist or not exist—viewing a thousand years as but a single breath. It cannot be measured by form or sought through traces. Therefore, that which cannot be spoken is called the Dao; by namelessness, one observes the beginning of Heaven and Earth; by desirelessness, one perceives its mystery. Thus, one engages in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching of no-words, causing the people to be without knowledge or desire through non-contention and non-theft. This was how, as Zhou declined, Laozi sought to restore customs and save the age by returning to simplicity.\n\nHad he, at that time of moral decay, instead instructed the people in the ways of names, desires, action, and words, how could they have known that the crooked is made whole, the bent is made straight, the hollow is filled, and the worn is renewed? Thus, he stabilized the age with the nameless uncarved block, so that none could distinguish Dao from benevolence and righteousness—thereby restoring antiquity.\n\nHis words emerged in the aftermath of Qin’s tyranny, and when Han arose, its governance was aided by purity and stillness, like water quenching fire. Was this not the precedence of Huang-Lao over the Six Classics? Speaking of the trends of the time, Laozi valued the Dao’s emptiness and non-being, adapting to change through non-action. Hence, his writings, subtle and profound, are indeed difficult to fathom.\n\nLater rulers of the world adopted his teachings as their model. What remained of his legacy was enshrined as the *Celestial Canon* and *Cavern Records*, revealed in *Numinous Writings* and *Hidden Instructions*. Cultivated in the self, it enables transcendence and ascent to the heavens; applied to others, it saves the world and benefits all things—thus encompassing the Dao of both inner sageliness and outer kingship.\n\nYet if one clings to the theories of great scholars and masters, reducing it to the likes of Zhuangzi and Liezi, dispersing the *Dao and Virtue* into mere discourse, or worse, conflating it with the Legalist and Nominalist schools of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, this is entirely misguided. Even more extreme is the error of dismissing it as mere emptiness and delusion.\n\nNevertheless, the *Veritable Record*’s meticulous and comprehensive account could not have arisen from private veneration alone, deceiving the world and enduring so long. Now, our August Emperor, endowed with Heaven’s mandate and benevolent sagacity, has first annotated the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls, employing it to govern with purity and tranquility. What greater fortune could there be for our Dao?\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the Hongwu reign, the Bureau of Daoist Registrars was established, and our fellow mountain dweller, Master Cao Xiwu, assumed office. His virtuous conduct and sincerity have earned him imperial favor surpassing all previous ages—could this not be due to his support of the transformative power of purity and non-action?\n\nIn his leisure, he examined and corrected this record, commissioning its printing to broaden its transmission, and asked me to compose this preface. Though I am unworthy and tremble at the task, how could I refuse to set forth its beginnings? Yet the Dao of divine transformation and mysterious penetration—what the sage leaves unspoken beyond the Six Directions—is glimpsed herein. With reverence, I write this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Gazetteer of Mount Longhu***\n\nThe Dao lies hidden in the most subtle yet manifests in the most evident. Heaven and Earth are vast, their yin and yang revolving in cycles, yet principle is made manifest therein. The myriad things flourish and decline in endless succession, yet pattern is made manifest therein. This subtlest of mechanisms lies concealed within the most evident, unseen by mortals. Only after persisting for a thousand years without extinction does its truth become known.\n\nThat which is called the Dao—empty, formless, profound, and silent—originates in Heaven. Within the boundless and indistinct, its essence and signs reside. Though unseen, it may yet be known.\n\nOur Most High’s teaching, from the time of the Yellow Emperor and the Wen and Jing emperors onward, has consistently employed its principles of purity and non-action, proven effective in the world. Some compare it to the Legalist and Nominalist schools of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, while others dismiss it as the strange and absurd doctrines of fangshi. Thus, there are those who condemn and reject it as heterodoxy.\n\nYet Sima Qian observed that its movements align with the formless, sustaining the myriad things, its guidance simple and easily grasped. The Daoist school has indeed existed since antiquity. Thus, the words of Guan Yin and Zhuangzi and Liezi have further elucidated what was incomplete. Their teachings of softness, humility, and withdrawal were sufficient to remedy Zhou’s decline, guiding the world and shaping customs. How could one regard them as mere profundities?\n\nMoreover, the establishment of spiritual teachings as guidance—how could it deceive later generations to lead them astray? From the Warring States onward, Mao Jun of Qin, our ancestral Celestial Master of Han, Xu and Ge of Wu—all stand as its most illustrious exemplars. The Celestial Master, endowed with a once-in-an-era disposition, received the transmission directly from the Most High. Thus, the esoteric transmissions of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, talismanic methods—once concealed within the nine heavens and ten poles—descended in full to the world. He then journeyed to Wu in Shu, where he refined the elixir upon Dragon-Tiger Mountain. This mountain, renowned throughout the realm, ranks among the blessed lands, and is celebrated alongside the Three Maos and Mount Jian. Since the Marquis of Liu of our Zhang clan, forty-eight generations have passed—surpassing even these two mountains in distinction.\n\nThrough the Wei, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties, each era bestowed honors and ranks in full measure. Whether in the splendor of its mountains and rivers, the magnificence of its temples, the flourishing of its people; the marvels of its immortal traces, the numinous efficacy of its Daoist practices, or the eminence of its titles and prestige—each generation has admired, extolled, and immortalized them in poetry and prose, engraving them in metal and stone. The transmission has endured for over two thousand years, growing ever more prosperous with time, its influence expanding ever further. Was this not due to the boundless virtue of past generations—relieving the suffering of beings, averting disasters, and shielding from calamities—whose hidden blessings sustained the people, subtly aiding royal transformation, and thus ensuring an unbroken lineage of such enduring renown? Or was it also the profound favor of the mountain and river spirits, nurturing and protecting them to achieve this?\n\nThus, the *Mountain Records* cannot be left unrecorded. In the spring of the second year of Huangqing of the Yuan, Master Wu, the hereditary preceptor of the Mysterious Teaching, compiled it into three scrolls and presented it to the court. The imperial decree ordered Minister Yuan, Wenqing, and Minister Cheng, Wenxian, to compose its preface. My great-grandfather, Master Liu, and my grandfather, Master Taixuan, basked in imperial favor, their glory resplendent in their time, honored in the annals of records—a distinction of the highest order. My late father, Master Chongxu, in the early reign of the previous emperor, was repeatedly summoned to the imperial presence, where profound grace was bestowed upon him. As for myself, though unworthy, I early inherited the teachings, received exceptional favor, and oversaw the renovation of the temple halls. Later, upon the enthronement of the present emperor, I was first to receive the imperial summons, enjoying the boundless benevolence and vast blessings of two reigns—gifts beyond full recounting.\n\nUpon reviewing the old records, I found them crude, shallow, and commonplace, and felt a deep sense of regret. Some said: \"In this flourishing age, if we do not delve into antiquity and seek out hidden truths to compile a grand record of the mountain’s glory, would we not allow its rare fragrance and noble footsteps to fade into obscurity, like a pearl buried in the depths, its precious essence neglected and uncherished—would this not be self-abandonment?\" Though my resolve is earnest, my learning falls short. I thus commanded Instructor Li Tangzhen, whose cultivation is pure and sincere, to search for missing materials. My second brother, Yuqing, with keen determination and sharp talent, vigorously assisted in the endeavor. The work was then divided into ten scrolls. As it neared completion, a virtuous gentleman offered to sponsor its printing—how could I not contribute a preface to commemorate this?\n\nThe Dao in the world moves in harmony with heaven and earth without conflict; as it resides in humanity, it is nothing less than flourishing and great. To record this without neglect is to worthily inherit its established legacy and extend its abundance to future generations. It should endure as long as the mountains and rivers—how could it ever end? Yet as eras change and ages pass, records may not capture everything in full. Still, those who admire its lingering influence and distant traces may yet find value in this work.\n\nRespectfully, I presume to place this preface at the beginning.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Genealogy of the Han Celestial Master’s Lineage**\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Manifest the Dao, and the numinous power of virtue is enacted—thus may one partake in divine communion and receive spiritual protection.\" That which fills heaven and earth, enduring through past and present without cease, is the Dao. To make the Dao manifest is to reveal its wondrous functions in full, aligning with virtue—thus may one respond to all changes and assist the divine. This is what is meant by \"assisting heaven and earth in their transformative nurturing.\"\n\nSima Qian said: \"The Daoist school practices non-action, concentrates the spirit, moves in accord with the formless, sustains the myriad things, adapts to the times, responds to transformations, establishes customs, and applies its methods—nothing is unsuitable.\" How true this is! The Most High was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of Archives for Zhou, later becoming the Historian Beneath the Pillar. Through unfathomable and divine transformations, he descended upon the world in successive ages as the founder of the Mysterious Teaching. Our ancestor, the Han Celestial Master, inheriting the legacy of the Marquis of Liu, personally received the Dao from the Most High. Thus, the hidden and untransmitted scriptures of the immortal canons and cavern records descended fully into the world. Thereafter, he subdued demons and spirits, refined the divine elixir, achieved transcendence, and transmitted the sword and seal to his descendants—a lineage now spanning fifteen hundred years. Though dynasties have changed and things have transformed, the transmission has never faltered. Is this not because the teachings of purity and non-action, with their numinous efficacy, align with the celestial virtue, and thus suffice to assist in transformation and nurturing?\n\nTo this day, in every renowned mountain and secluded region, immortal traces remain. The far-reaching fragrance of his descendants and the enduring glory of their lineage clearly attest to their hidden support of royal governance and their boundless beneficence toward the people. From the late Han onward, those dwelling on Dragon-Tiger Mountain lived in seclusion among cliffs and valleys, cultivating and refining to prolong their years. By the early Song, their Daoist practices gradually gained renown. During the Daoguan and Chongning eras, the Perfected Lord of Emptiness and Stillness emerged. His divine works and wondrous responses, once manifested in the practice of refining qi and cultivating form, thereafter flourished even more, rivaling the achievements of the past.\n\nAmong his descendants, none shone brighter than my great-grandfather, Master Weishan, and my grandfather, Master Taixuan. Their illustrious deeds in rituals and prayers, their encounters with imperial favor at its zenith—during that time, their marvelous signs and abundant traces were revered even by scholar-officials, surpassing what came before.\n\nIn our present dynasty, my late father, Master Chongxu, flourished under the sagely court, which had unified the realm and all beneath heaven. His lofty standing and towering prestige shone brilliantly in his time, his honors enduring from beginning to end—how could those of former eras compare? Such must be the legacy of a lineage blessed by divine luminaries.\n\nI, unworthy and of mediocre talent, have inherited this illustrious legacy, yet my undeserved favor from the throne fills me with trembling awe. As the history of our lineage remains obscure to the world, I fear its omissions and gaps. In earlier days, while attending my father, I received from him an old manuscript, which I entrusted to the eminent Daoist Tongxu. I sought a preface from the Grand Historian Song Lian, yet had no leisure to compile and edit it for circulation. The original text, however, was verbose and cumbersome; thus, I have presumptuously revised, abridged, and rearranged it for publication, hoping to fulfill my father’s wishes.\n\nAlas! The principle of all things is that they wax and wane. To bear the past forward and open the way for the future is no easy task. Since the latter ages, many have abandoned substance for superficiality, vying for power and profit. If one cannot attain mastery in learning and radiate the brilliance of virtue to exalt one’s lineage, how can they be said to carry on the work of their forebears? How could they even begin to comprehend it?\n\nWhat was transmitted by the Most High—its exalted virtue and conduct, its monumental achievements—ensures its perpetuation without end. Yet how is this so? It is because the divine and luminous reside in the person. Those who come after must strive with diligence, and if they can expound and continue this tradition, only then will its teachings not fall into oblivion.\n\nThis work is titled *Genealogical Records*, following the example of historical texts.\n\n**Postscript to the Zhang Lineage Genealogy**\n\nIn ancient times, those who received surnames and clan names were all descendants of sages and worthies. Some took their names from states, and though the states perished, the names endured. Over time, lineages faded and clans were lost—this was not uncommon. The system of genealogical records was overseen by a bureau established by historians. When the bureau was abolished, scholar-official families compiled their own genealogies to order generational ranks, distinguish degrees of kinship, and ensure that all descendants preserved the reverence for ancestors and respect for lineage. This is among the greatest duties of the noble-minded.\n\nThe Zhang clan traces its lineage to the Ji surname, descending from Qingyang, son of the Yellow Emperor. His fifth son, Hui, served as Minister of Bows, inventing the bow and arrow. He used nets to hunt birds and beasts, presided over the worship of the Fox Star, and his descendants perpetuated this office, thus being granted the surname Zhang. In the Yin dynasty, Zhang Muzi, and in the time of Emperor Yao, Zhang Guo, both gained fame as immortals. By the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, Zhang Zhong served as a minister, and his descendant Zhang Hou became a grandee of Jin. When the Three Families partitioned Jin, the Zhang clan served as ministers to Han for five generations. Sima Qian recorded that the Zhangs were originally of the Han royal clan. After Han’s fall, Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu, avenged the First Emperor of Qin and changed his surname. The old genealogy begins with the Marquis of Liu as the founding ancestor, with no records preceding him. Having examined its outline, I have sought to supplement its omissions.\n\nThe Marquis of Liu was originally from Fengyi in Pei. He aided Emperor Gaozu in establishing the Han dynasty, was enfeoffed as a marquis, and his lineage prospered for seven generations, many of whose meritorious deeds were recorded in history. By the Tang dynasty, the Zhangs were listed among forty-three eminent clans—including Anding, Fanyang, Taiyuan, Nanyang, Dunhuang, Xiuwu, Shanggu, Peiguo, Liangguo, Rongyang, Pingyuan, and Jingzhao—producing seventeen chancellors and eight marquises. In the tenth generation, the Celestial Master of Han, the True Man of Tongbai, was born. He moved from Pei to Hangzhou, passing through Dantu County in Zhenjiang, where there stood a temple to the Marquis of Liu. In Changzhou, the immortal site known as Zhanggong Cave also bore his name, likely a shrine to his beneficence. Thereafter, the family settled in Zhejiang.\n\nThe Celestial Master of Han was born on Tianmu Mountain in Hangzhou, becoming the founder of the Orthodox Unity tradition. Through his refinement of divine elixirs and exorcism of demonic forces, he journeyed to Shu and eventually settled on Longhushan in Xin[zhou]. His lineage flourished, surpassing all that came before. Historians, unaware of these developments, assumed that the Marquis of Liu’s line had ended when his state was abolished in the second generation. Little did they know of the thriving branches that spread across the north and south.\n\nFrom the tenth generation of the Celestial Master onward, the tombs remained intact, and the generational records preserved. Those residing on Longhushan numbered twenty-eight generations. Including the distant ancestors of the Marquis of Liu, whose origins are unknown, the lineage spans over fifty generations. As for the divergences among branches, the distinctions between prominence and obscurity, and their various fates—these cannot be fully traced.\n\nSome traditions hold that the Zhang clans of Shixiao in Min and Shangrao in Xin[zhou] share common ancestry. When questioned, their descendants and elders could still recount old tales, yet when pressed for generational records, no evidence could be found. As for the inquiries across the regions east and west of the Yangtze—where lineages of lofty rank and esteemed repute have flourished, and where the imperial court’s reverence has never waned—few can rival them. Could this enduring prosperity and longevity arise without the divine efficacy and transformative power of their ancestral line, whose virtue has spread across the four directions?\n\nYet I have often lamented how those in the world who crave fame and praise fabric genealogies to dazzle others. In their eagerness to claim kinship with the noble and illustrious, they resort to forced connections and convoluted proofs. Where, then, lies their true filial piety? Our Zhang lineage, descended from divine luminaries, has endured for over a thousand years. Yet commentators dismiss it merely as a succession of empty titles within an esoteric tradition—unaware that the transmission of jade tablets and sacrificial vessels has continued unbroken across generations. Perhaps the fault lies in the insufficiency of records. Still, that its full glory remains obscured stems from earlier generations’ lack of resolve in seeking the root. Thus, even the most learned scholars of the time left no written account of it—a profound regret.\n\nToday, our lineage’s descendants are but a fraction of what they once were. The ebb and flow of fortune evoke both sorrow and joy, yet how can we neglect the task of compilation? I, however, am of mediocre talent and unworthy of this burden, ever fearful that the thread may snap, leaving future generations ignorant of their origins. How then will they honor their lineage and safeguard its foundation?\n\nSome say that in compiling genealogies, the close should be detailed and the distant abbreviated. Each descendant should elaborate on their immediate kin, so that even the abbreviated entries may be inferred through mutual reference. Later generations must grasp the weight of their ancestors’ virtue and legacy, dedicating themselves to its preservation, ensuring that its influence and grace do not fade. Only then can they truly inherit its goodness.\n\nThe words of Han Xiang, who urged reverence for family records and remembrance of ancestral glory, reflect the essence of learning—how can we not take heed? Thus, the ancient system of genealogies, designed to strengthen the root, was not established in vain. Here, I append these reflections to the end of this compilation, tracing its origins, while leaving the task of full illumination to the great hands of our age.\n\n**Postscript to the Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, the Vacuous Tranquility Perfected Lord**\n\nWithin the cosmos, the purest essence of light and mountain-spirit coalesces in humanity alone. When one cultivates the self, what lies within inevitably manifests without. How, then, can one who harbors such inner abundance remain silent? Even the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi—who cast aside the body, subdued the senses, and rejected all external attachments, turning wholly inward—required words to convey and establish their doctrines for posterity. From this, we see that even those who wander beyond the mundane world do not deem words useless.\n\nTheir words, like clouds drifting across the vast sky or ripples on a still pond, form patterns with their movement, yet defy pursuit by mere traces. This differs from the words of Confucians, whose expressions range from bold and unrestrained when successful to melancholic and lamenting when in adversity. Nevertheless, the Dao’s profound spiritual transformations, which endure as long as heaven, are not defined by the presence or absence of words—how then could one judge immortality by them?\n\nThe Thirtieth Ancestor, the Vacuous Tranquility Perfected Lord, possessed innate wisdom and karmic roots, flourishing in an era of harmony. During the Chongning and Jingkang reigns, Emperor Huizong’s devotion to the Dao reached its peak, and true immortals emerged in abundance. Among them were Xu Shenfang, Wang Wenqing, and Lin Lingsu, who stood alongside the Perfected Lord in that age. Whether subduing malevolent spirits, calming turbulent tides, or receiving imperial honors, their deeds bore extraordinary signs.\n\nAs the nation faced hardship, the Perfected Lord foresaw omens of disaster and, with a mere gesture, summoned wind, thunder, and timely rains. His divine power was so manifest that he became a paragon of the celestial court, his blessings extending to all beings. Though centuries have passed, people still speak of him with admiration—not like those who sought fleeting fame, only to vanish without a trace.\n\nThe *Record of Responses and Transformations* meticulously documents his meritorious deeds. His teachings, which guided the world, and his verses, which refined the spirit, continue to awaken the deluded and dispel ignorance. Had he not roamed beyond the primordial chaos of the cosmic egg, shed the dust of the mundane world, and attained a state utterly free of even the slightest impurity, could his attainments have reached such heights?\n\nThose across the land who recite and long to see his works regret their incompleteness. Though they were once published, much has since been lost. I have sought them in sacred mountains and re-engraved them to broaden their transmission. May scholars and seekers alike delve into the meaning beyond his words, awakening to the secrets of the \"fire talisman\" and plumbing the mysteries of lead and mercury. In this, they will find an enduring teacher, advancing toward the realm of Dao and virtue.\n\nIn the vast wilderness, by the shores of the formless, amidst towering peaks and ancient trees, on evenings when the wind is clear and the moon bright—who can fathom the descent of rainbow banners and cloud-borne sashes as one chants his ethereal verses, where forests echo and springs respond? Should his words not endure alongside those of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nI, Yu Chu, unworthy heir to this lineage, am ill-equipped to fully extol his virtues. Fearing omissions, I offer this brief preface, awaiting the brush of a master.\n\n**Preface to the *You Ran Pavilion Collection***\n\nAll things, from their first sprouting and budding, embody the intent of ceaseless generation. Yet as they grow in abundance and grandeur, few recognize this truth. What we perceive are merely the shifting hues of flourishing and withering through the seasons—we have not grasped their origins.\n\nIf all things are thus, how much more so the human heart, which even fewer examine? The goodness inherent in human nature—once consciousness takes shape—exists in all, quietly abiding within, no different from the Way of things. Yet private desires and worldly concerns obscure this truth, just as the flourishing and withering of seasons cannot be escaped. Only by perceiving these obscurations and dissolving desires entirely does the original goodness of the serene heart remain. Thus, the path of learning lies in embracing benevolence and righteousness, upholding ritual and discipline, to preserve its center and restore its origin. Then the serene heart within—like the kernel within a fruit—exists in us without question.\n\nFor a scholar to establish himself and honor his kin is not to seek success through such means; otherwise, it cannot be called true learning. In Poyang and the western prefectures of Jiangxi, wealthy merchants expanded their fortunes through trade. During the Five Dynasties, eminent scholars and great families flourished, with the Zhou clan being particularly prominent. By the Yuan dynasty, Nan Weng, Director of the Bureau of Scholarly Worthies, was renowned for his learning. Dwelling among the lakes and fields, where mountains gleamed and waters shimmered, he delighted in the scenery and built the You Ran Pavilion there, perhaps inspired by the poetry of Tao Yuanming of Jin. Soon after, he entered court, where officials and scholars all composed tributes in his honor.\n\nInitially, both Nan Weng and his elder, Left Vice Director Bo Wen, held illustrious positions, their clan prosperous and numerous. Their kinsman, Langzhong, upheld the family legacy without fail. When war erupted at the end of the Yuan, the pavilion was destroyed, but upon Langzhong’s return from official service, he recovered and preserved the relics of past generations as if they were his ancestors’ own handiwork. I, humbled by my deep bond with Langzhong, was shown his collection and entrusted with these words.\n\nThis compilation shines with literary brilliance, reflecting Nan Weng’s prosperous era, though the name *You Ran* was chosen in his days of obscurity. Its various compositions—flavored with the praises of renowned officials and scholars—celebrate his later success. Though his affection for his homeland’s lakes and mountains may differ from Tao Yuanming’s seclusion, the enduring legacy of his family and the serene heart he cultivated, expressed through landscape and inspiration, set him apart. Nevertheless, the vicissitudes of scenery, like the cycles of flourishing and withering, are bound by the principles of qi and reason. Those with deep roots have profound origins, just as the longevity of a family depends on the depth of its accumulated virtue.\n\nDuring the height of the Yuan, scholars from all directions gathered like clouds, yet how many of the Zhou clan’s contemporaries remain today? Langzhong not only continued their legacy but also reassembled this collection to inspire future generations, revealing the serene heart that lies within. My ancestor, Tai Xuan, shared a generational bond with Nan Weng and Bo Wen, and I have been honored with Langzhong’s friendship across three generations—how could I refuse this request? If his descendants cherish this work, the legacy of *You Ran* will transcend the constraints of prosperity and decline, for it springs from the boundless manifestation of perfect virtue.\n\nThus, I offer this preface in respectful response to his request.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Essentials of the Elixir Manual***\n\nWhen the writings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi emerged, our Dao flourished. Historical records tell of the Yellow Emperor seeking the Way from Guangchengzi on Mount Kongtong, whose teachings—though neither mystical nor abstruse—were concise, essential, and readily understood and practiced. Later, King Mu of Zhou constructed the Grass Pavilion to welcome recluses, elevating their esteem. Masters like Guan Yin and Zhuangzi, active during the Warring States, differed in their approaches according to the times, yet their transmission shared a single source.\n\nAt its root lie the Three Caverns, Nine Tiers, and the various scriptures of the Daoist Canon. Its application in the world is the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship. For instance, the governance of the Duke of Zhou and Cao Shen through tranquility exemplifies this. Its essence lies in returning from existence to non-existence, from fullness to emptiness, following the flow of primordial qi, deepening the root and firming the stem, returning to the origin and reverting to the source. Thus, nature and life merge, one guards the singular truth, and transcends into the formless.\n\nBy the time of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, they were deluded by alchemical arts, and the teachings became confused. Later, the so-called *Golden Elixir* and *Great Cinnabar* originated with the *Golden Green Dragon-Tiger Scripture* and the *Supreme Stone Wall Song*. During the Han, Wei Boyang, drawing from the *Golden Green Scripture*, composed the *Triplex Unity*, using the *Book of Changes* to elucidate the elixir. He expounded on the five phases, eight trigrams, yin-yang, and the warp and weft of cosmic principles, detailing the mechanisms of fire, medicine, growth, and transformation. Some cited minerals, plants, and herbs to illustrate substance and function; others employed metaphors of infants and transcendent beasts to conceal profound mysteries.\n\nThose who followed, however, drowned in metaphorical language about wood and stone, losing sight of the essential meaning and misleading the world. Not only did the transmissions of inner and outer alchemy become obscured, but those unversed in their exploration dismissed them as bizarre and deceitful, dismissing the true principles of body, mind, nature, and life. Such distortions not only misled their own time but also left lasting harm for future generations.\n\nThe transmission of outer alchemy involves refining the essence of the five metals and eight minerals according to the fire phases and the *Yin Convergence*, no different in principle from the ascent and descent of inner alchemy. Thus, the workings of inner and outer alchemy are one. Before birth, the human form belongs to yin, formed by the congealment of essence and qi. It must draw upon the essence of metals and minerals, the radiance of clouds and sunlight, to refine and transform, achieving the marvel of lightness and flight. Hence, among famous mountains and rivers, remnants of elixir furnaces and medicinal cauldrons remain. The legacies of our ancestors—the Celestial Master of Han, Historian Xu, and Immortal Ge—are particularly renowned. To abandon these two transmissions is to embrace falsehood.\n\nIn the late Yuan, unscrupulous individuals promoted heretical teachings on \"sexual arts,\" compiling spurious texts under the guise of venerable traditions to deceive the world.\n\nWealthy merchants and powerful magnates often pursue these practices in hopes of prolonging life, yet their indulgence in desire inevitably leads to the ruin of body and fate. How dire must be the karmic retribution for those who first propagated such teachings! I have long wished to eradicate this pernicious influence, yet my reach has not been wide enough.\n\nOthers rely on texts concerning herbs, clouds, mists, massage, or Daoist breathing exercises, treating them as shortcuts to mastery. Though these may nurture longevity, to seek true accomplishment through them is as futile as climbing a tree to catch a fish or carrying firewood to extinguish a blaze—nothing more than the proliferation of heretical doctrines and reckless conduct.\n\nThere are the Northern and Southern Lineages: the Quanzhen School venerates Wang Chongyang of the Golden Perfection, while the Southern Lineage follows Zhang Ziyang. Zhang’s writings are abundant yet veiled, while Wang’s are direct and concise. Zhang’s transmission requires the integration of inner and outer alchemy to achieve fruition, whereas Wang’s focuses solely on inner cultivation. Yet the profound secrets of their teachings must be pursued with diligent inquiry, for they cannot be fully conveyed through texts alone.\n\nI inherited this tradition under the gracious and munificent favor of the August Emperor, who urged me to advance in the study of the Daoist lineage. For over a decade now, I have traveled far and wide, engaging in discussion and seeking counsel from masters of the four directions, never daring to rest. Yet my humble talents and limited understanding have left me unable to fully repay the imperial benevolence or illuminate the radiance of our teachings. This compilation, titled *Essentials of Elixir Refinement*, gathers the scriptures, treatises, poems, and formulas I have studied over the years—from the divine masters and patriarchs of antiquity down to the present—examining their differences and selecting their essentials to serve as a guiding standard for learners. It is not merely for ease of study but aims to elucidate the principles of nature and destiny, the vital essence of spirit and qi, uniting all in one comprehensive whole. Through recitation and contemplation, one may avoid the pitfalls of erroneous teachings and need not heed the derision of those who seek worldly utility or universal benefit. In this way, the transmission of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Liezi may yet remain unbroken. If this work is disseminated widely and enduringly, the blessings of our Dao may reach all. Moreover, for those who retreat to the mountains and forests, accumulating practice day by day without cease, how can the attainment of transcendence and soaring through the heavens remain unattainable? Yet this depends on those of superior capacity and deep karmic roots, who must realize it through their own cultivation.\n\nHerein lies the preface to the *Commentary on the Scripture of the Generation of the Divine Chapters*.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"The divine is that which wondrously brings forth the myriad things.\" It accomplishes transformation and governs the spirits; its divinity is boundless, so profound that even the sage cannot fully comprehend it. The *Changes* speaks of the divine in the most absolute terms. All things arise from the singular qi, which divides to form the Supreme Ultimate, the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Five Phases, each occupying its place within qi. From the distribution of the Five Phases’ qi, the ceaseless generation of the ten thousand things unfolds. In the movement of the Five Phases, yang culminates in nine, yin in six; the principles of two, five, nine, and one are all contained within the Five Phases. One is the root of all numbers, and qi is the mother of all existence. The flow of qi is governed by the divine, from which all transformations emerge. Heaven is formed by the accumulation of qi, and the Emperor is named for his governance of the divine.\n\nFrom the singular qi arise the three qi, from the three arise the nine qi, and from the nine qi comes boundless generation, filling the six directions—all transformations of qi, which we call the various heavens. These heavens return to emptiness and nothingness, for they cannot be sought through form. Thus, the establishment of our teachings is rooted in emptiness and spontaneity, which are none other than spirit and qi. To know how to nurture spirit and qi is to perfect the Way of nature and destiny. Though the methods of cultivation may vary, their origin in the Three Caverns and Nine Heavens is one.\n\nThe three realms are vast and obscure, their talismans forming scriptures unlike the mundane discourses of the human world. The *Scripture of the Generation of the Divine Chapters in the Nine Heavens* is profound in its meaning, its divisions and phrases revealing the deepest mysteries. Each chapter governs an original destiny and corresponds to a heaven, exhausting the path of refinement. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it delivers souls. Its recitation—nine cycles and seven repetitions—follows numerical subtleties that can lead to spontaneous attainment, ascending to the celestial court in broad daylight. Yet this is not merely the result of recitation.\n\nTen completes the cycle of numbers, upon which the creation of heaven and earth depends. The human body embodies the creation of heaven and earth—how could the Way of transcendence and response remain unattainable? The text adheres to the principles of golden elixir and return to the origin, for nine is the number of yang. The wondrous teachings of the Primordial Beginning and the petitions of the Divine Kings are most solemn in their warnings of calamities and karmic seeds. Since the eras of Red Clarity and Kaihuang, the celestial bureaus have conducted their selections, ascending step by step. Those who neither cultivate virtuous conduct nor seek the supreme Way—how could they not feel profound awe and trepidation? Those who do cultivate may not only transcend the kalpas and achieve perfection but also ascend to the ranks of the divine, for this arises from nurturing qi, refining spirit, returning the nine qi to the myriad spirits, and merging the three realms into one qi.\n\nThis is what is meant by knowing the divinity of the divine, without which one cannot grasp the source of its divinity. Regarding the discourse on life and death, refining the self’s spirit can deliver the departed. Though this manifests the boundless compassion of the Most High, it also stems from the immeasurable merit of self-cultivation. Thus, this scripture harmonizes with the *Scripture of Salvation*, the *Great Cavern*, and the *Scripture of Deliverance from Suffering*, their inner and outer meanings fused as one. Those who diligently recite and study it, interpreting its words to fathom its depths, will daily deepen their understanding of the Dao.\n\nDong Guishan of Qingyuan has provided clear and insightful annotations, serving as a bridge between the seen and unseen worlds. In my leisure, I have commissioned its carving and printing to broaden its transmission, a deed of profound kindness and beneficence. When asked to write a preface, how could I presume to expound its principles and guide all toward reverence, whether in this world or beyond? Yet by adhering to its teachings and cultivating without cease, one may eventually attain spiritual transformation, soaring through the void, returning one’s celestial nature to the realm of emptiness and nothingness, and roaming the heights of purity and clarity. This depends on those of superior capacity and deep karmic roots, who must realize it through their own evidence.\n\nThus, this preface is placed at the beginning.\n\n**Preface to the Record of Mount Wuyi**\n\nThose who compile geographical records and local gazettes often overlook the renowned mountains and great rivers, their numinous traces and distant wanderings left insufficiently detailed. This is not due to gaps in the historical records, but rather because the learned scholars of later ages, wary of empty exaggerations, have shunned such accounts. Yet the immortals and perfected beings of antiquity—wherever their divine presence dwells—manifest everywhere. Their extraordinary powers to avert disasters and ward off calamities, their unfailing responses to prayers, surely contribute in hidden ways to the imperial order. How could they lack merit in aiding the world? Yet if historians fail to record them or chroniclers neglect their details, then after a thousand years, their traces may fade into oblivion. Should not those who study the teachings devote themselves to preserving such knowledge?\n\nWuyi in Jianning is the Grotto-Heaven of Ascending Perfection and Mystic Transformation. According to the *Records of Hongjian* from the Jin dynasty, a divine being once descended upon the mountain’s summit, claiming the title \"Lord of Wuyi\" after receiving the Emperor’s mandate to govern the earthbound immortals. The mountain thus took its name. Yet the *Biographies of the Immortals* in the *Transmissions of Bai Ziqing* states that a man of Qin named Qian Keng once secluded himself there with his two sons, the elder named Wu and the younger Yi. The truth of these accounts remains unresolved.\n\nThe *Han Treatise on Sacrifices* records that Emperor Wu of Han once worshipped the Lord of Wuyi in Jianning, entrusting the rites to his sacrificial officials. Remnants of the Han-era altar still stand on the mountain. Some say that on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the First Emperor of Qin, the Supreme Emperor, along with the Primordial Lady of Mount Taimu and the Perfected Wei Zijian, convened a gathering atop the Peak of the Canopy Pavilion. A rainbow bridge spanned the heavens, and hundreds of figures ascended in single file. They addressed the locals as \"descendants\" and feasted them with wine and fruit, their chambers adorned with brocade, their furnishings resplendent, celestial music resounding. Then, as wind and rain arose, they vanished without a trace.\n\nZijian had first studied the Dao on this mountain, learning alongside Zhang Zhan, Sun Chuo, and eleven others. They encountered an immortal riding a crane and received the teachings, all ascending to immortality. From the Tang and Song through the Yuan dynasties, those who attained transcendence here emerged in every generation.\n\nThe Chongyou Abbey was first established during the Tianbao era of the Tang. By the eighth year of Baoda in the Southern Tang, Li Xuanfu, having attained realization in the Dao, relocated it to its present site and was granted the name \"Assembly of Immortals.\" In the early Song, its halls and corridors were renovated. Emperor Taizong honored it with an imperial edict, and in the second year of Xiangfu, it was endowed with fields.\n\nIn the early Xining era, an official of the second rank was appointed to oversee it. During the Shaosheng, Yuanfu, Duanping, Jiaxi, and Shaoding reigns, prayers for rain were invariably answered, prompting repeated bestowals of honorific titles and grants of land and tax exemptions. In the Tianli era of the Yuan, imperial favor was again conferred as before, and those of pure conduct and steadfast virtue never ceased to emerge. Thus, its renown spread throughout the realm, rivaling even the Three Mountains in fame.\n\nThe region is known as \"Cinnabar Mountain and Azure Waters,\" where extraordinary peaks and splendid ridges emerge in succession along the winding river, their cliffs and hues embracing one another in a grand encircling embrace. Caves, grottoes, and sacred altars abound beyond enumeration, each a site of unparalleled beauty, and which among them has not been the dwelling of transcendent beings and extraordinary figures? Thus, luminaries such as Master Zhu Wen, Minister Cai Wenjie, and Academician Liu Wenjian—eminent scholars and great Confucians of their time—also studied and lectured here. That the splendor of the Nine Bends is renowned across the four directions is no mere coincidence.\n\nI have often marveled at the gatherings of the two Directors Yang and Xu on Mount Sanmao within the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, or at the assembly of Ma Gu with Cai Jing and Fangping upon the immortal’s altar. Consulting the records, even Liu Xiang of the Han, famed for his exhaustive mastery of texts, did not speak falsely. From this, we know that the gatherings at Manting were not baseless, and how could they go unrecorded? The mountain’s annals are meticulously researched and detailed, truly worthy of transmission to posterity.\n\nI have long wished to visit but have yet to fulfill this desire. The abbey’s superintendent, so-and-so, recently requested a preface, and though I am unworthy due to my shallowness, I have sought out the accounts of elders and fragmentary texts to supplement what was lacking.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Records of the White Crane Abbey***\n\nSince the Yellow Emperor obtained the tripod and ascended after refining the elixir of immortality, and King Mu of Zhou built the Grass Pavilion to summon immortals, tales of transcendence have flourished. By the Qin and Han dynasties, the fervor for seeking immortality reached its peak, and masters of esoteric arts emerged in succession, often resorting to fantastical claims and exaggerations to deceive and captivate rulers enamored of such pursuits. The transmission of their arcane and abstruse teachings, mingled with falsehoods, naturally drew ridicule from their contemporaries. Yet were there not true immortals who concealed themselves in remote and secluded places, abandoning fame and renown to cultivate the Dao? Their alchemical furnaces, medicinal mortars, sacred scriptures, and profound secrets were either hidden within mountain caves or left in the world in concealment or revelation. Though their traces differed, their legacy has been transmitted from antiquity to the present, generation after generation.\n\nThe White Crane Abbey in Fengcheng, Jiangxi, traces its origins to the era of Emperor Wen of Chen’s *Dajian* reign, where the divine traces of the immortal Gan Jun remain. In his youth, Gan Jun was renowned for his filial piety, his conduct celebrated in his hometown. After years of Daoist study, he heard of the virtuous Xu Jun of Jingyang and sought him as his master. Xu Jun accompanied him to study under the female immortal Chen Mu of Danyang, where Gan Jun received esoteric teachings. His mastery of the Dao grew daily, and he followed Xu Jun in accumulating merit along the rivers and lakes. Whether subduing monstrous pines, slaying flood dragons, or exorcising malevolent spirits, he wielded his three-foot sword to achieve feats that would benefit myriad generations. His name and deeds endure eternally—how could it be otherwise? Moreover, his meritorious deeds are too numerous to record in full.\n\nXu Jun, too, disseminated teachings on clarity, loyalty, and filial piety, all rooted in the principle of the Great Mean and utmost rectitude—unlike the mere talismans, incantations, and pacing the stars practiced by others. Gan Jun, renowned for his filial conduct, ascended to immortality and soared through the heavens. Was not his attainment of the Dao and his merit largely due to his loyalty and filial piety? Thus, the path of immortals to transcend the mundane does not abandon humaneness but rather perfects it. That Gan Jun, having achieved the Dao, served his mother until her passing before departing—this is the epitome of harmonizing both.\n\nMoreover, the abodes of immortals are invariably situated in landscapes of majestic beauty, and the elegance of Fengcheng’s scenery must have nurtured his innate qualities. This spring, on my return from paying respects at the Jade Dragon Abbey on Mount Xishan, I passed through the White Crane Abbey. Though it was a stormy evening, I sought out its relics and remnants, and my admiration was deeply stirred. Though the abbey lies in a secluded corner, its scenery is serene and exquisite. Upon inquiry, I learned that its two main halls once housed the abbot’s quarters of my ancestor, the Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang, and that the Dragon Pool before them was where the Perfected Lord Feihuan once soared. The Daoist assembly leader, Zou, and the elder, Xiong, who oversee the abbey, presented me with Gan Jun’s *Elixir Canon*, the abbey’s records, and a letter from the Perfected Lord to Abbot Ren. Their words were profoundly illuminating, and though the events are extraordinary and the names endure, how could one not feel a deep sense of regret and longing?\n\nLater that summer, someone arrived from the mountain and requested a preface for the abbey’s records. From my youth, I have been enamored of renowned mountains and rivers, seeking to explore their hidden wonders, yet I have always regretted not being able to visit all the famous sites of antiquity and the present. Now, having read the words of the immortal Gan and walked upon his sacred ground, how could I refuse to write this preface? Moreover, this pertains to the lingering echoes and lost traces of my ancestor—how could I not strive to detail their records? That the abbey’s superintendent has diligently fulfilled his duty and compiled these texts, intending to preserve them in print, is truly a commendable pursuit of their origins. If in the future the numinous transformations of true immortals endure alongside these records, will this not be a great boon to our Dao? Those who follow, take heed and strive onward.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Collected Poems of Master Danmo* by Zhang**\n\nThe *Collected Poems of Master Danmo*, comprising several volumes, has been compiled by my friend Dazhuang, who has asked me to write a preface. I cannot refuse.\n\nIn my youth, I often attended Master Zhang in the presence of my late father and benefited greatly from his teachings. At that time, the esteemed local scholars Lu Bogong and Xia Bocheng were his fellow students and friends, and their scholarly pursuits advanced in tandem, making it impossible to discern who was foremost. Master Zhang hailed from a prominent family in our district, which had produced generations of officials and scholars since the Song and Yuan dynasties, many of whom gained renown through their literary achievements.\n\nFrom childhood, Master Zhang displayed exceptional talent and a keen intellect. As he matured, his learning became vast and his memory prodigious, though he excelled particularly in poetry. During the late Yuan dynasty, poets of neighboring prefectures who gained fame—such as Zhang Zhongju, Huang Junrui, and Wei Dapu—all engaged with him as peers.\n\nMaster Li Zhonggong and Master Zhu Fanyuan were still his teachers. He traveled to Yan and Zhao with his accumulated learning, yet ultimately found no kindred spirits, and so journeyed through Wu and Chu before returning to settle. Before long, the realm was thrown into turmoil, and heroes arose on all sides. Those who usurped power and seized titles, hearing of his reputation, sought to recruit him, but he withdrew in seclusion and refused to bend. His hardships and loyal indignation were all expressed in his poetry, while his spirit remained as bold and unyielding as ever.\n\nAt the founding of our dynasty, when the realm was first pacified, he was among the first recluses summoned to the capital. He was appointed magistrate of Jiading Prefecture, and upon completing his term, was permitted to retire due to age. He then returned home, journeying along the Yi, Wu, Yue, Huai, and Xiang rivers. In his later years, he built a retreat among the fields and forests, secluding himself to teach at home, and his poetry grew ever more refined. Once, when dozens of the prefecture’s people were falsely implicated in a fabricated disaster, Master Zhang exonerated them and secured their safety—a deed for which the people still hold him in gratitude.\n\nHis poetry, in form and spirit, drew from the *Airs* and *Elegantiae*, while deeply immersing itself in the styles of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties. As for the poets of the High Tang and the early Yuan, he did not deign to mention them. His bearing was lofty and imposing, his appearance striking, and thus his words and thoughts flowed with divine swiftness, as if preordained. He did not rely on exhaustive search or labored thought, yet achieved a grandeur both profound and enduring—like the boundless clouds of the vaulted heavens or the ceaseless waves of the Yangtze—immeasurable and beyond tracing. This is why those of shallow talent and narrow vision could never attain his heights. His renown among princes, scholars, and officials was thus well-earned.\n\nAlas, much of his lifetime’s writings was lost amid the ravages of war, with only fragments remaining. Master Lu once gathered what he could—perhaps one or two hundred pieces—intending to preserve them in print. Before the task was complete, he passed away, and the collection was again scattered, with little surviving. Those who cherished his work could not bear to discard it, and so I have transcribed a tenth of it, most of which aligns with the selections in *Dazhuang’s* compilation.\n\nThough I once studied under Master Zhang and failed to live up to his teachings, how dare I presume to compose this account? Yet his learning was vast, his words eloquent, and his literary brilliance unmatched in his time. His great virtue and towering reputation were already evident in his deeds, and his legacy, though dimmed, shall not fade into oblivion.\n\nMy elder brother *Dazhuang*, diligent in study and devoted to righteousness, will surely carry on Master Lu’s aspirations with ease—how could he not delight in upholding the Way of literature?\n\nThe Master’s personal name was *Shuai*, his courtesy name *Mengxun*, and his sobriquet *Danmo*. His disciples referred to him as *Master Danmo*.\n\n**Zong Lian’s Preface**\n\nMy friend, Master Ni Zizheng, in his youth studied under our late teacher, Master Xia, and later received the teachings of Master Lu’s *benxin* doctrine from Master Peng Mengyue. His conduct was steadfast and sincere, earning the trust of his community—even the humble and unlearned recognized him as a gentleman. Though he lived in poverty in a humble lane, he remained self-disciplined, cautious in his associations, and sparing in speech. He never ceased seeking instruction from teachers and friends, and his demeanor was always marked by humility. Afflicted by chronic illness, he seldom wrote, but when compelled to compose, he grounded his work in the classics, ensuring its purity and correctness.\n\nI once heard the teachings of *xingli* from Master Peng, and in our discussions and refinements, Master Ni was my greatest aid. For over a decade, our bond remained as close as a single day. In a certain year, he was recommended for office and appointed instructor of Xinjian, returning home twice during his tenure. There, we delved into the words and deeds of ancient sages and worthies, finding solace in the quiet of overgrown groves, crumbling pavilions, lamplight, and moonlit ponds. His spirit was rich and sincere, rivaling that of the ancients.\n\nIn the spring of the seventeenth year of *Hongwu*, he traveled to the capital after mourning his parents, but succumbed to a minor illness and passed away. Overcome with grief, I urged his son, Heng, to preserve his father’s writings. Four years later...\n\nHeng presented several writings, titled *Zonglian Ye*, and entreated, saying: \"When my late father served in Xinjian, the county academy was once the study hall of Prime Minister Zonglian of the Yuan. Hence, he named his work thus. None understood my father’s depth of learning as Master Mo did—would you honor us with a preface?\" Unable to refuse, I read the texts twice and sighed in reflection: \"Of scholars who pursue learning, many seek fulfillment through others, while few seek it within themselves. My friend was nurtured by the harmony of heaven and earth, the refinement of mountains and rivers, and the blessings of his ancestors. His nature was pure, his qi clear, his conduct upright and unsullied—qualities beyond the reach of mediocre scholars or vulgar men. Having fulfilled himself inwardly, he had no need of external validation. Thus, his discourse and manner arose from the simplicity of principle and the subtlety of attaining the Dao, self-evident without exhaustive inquiry, self-manifest without deliberate assertion. Was this not the fruit of his innate understanding?\n\nNaturally, in his actions and teachings, he eschewed superficial recitation or rhetorical flourish, grounding all in the rectification of the self and sincerity of purpose. With the self rectified and sincerity established, the Way of the sages and the methods of governing the world were already complete—what need was there for superfluous elaboration? His policy proposals, lectures, and expositions all emerged from the essentials of uprightness and the methods of self-cultivation. Even the Yang and Qian of the Lu school would scarcely surpass him. His poems and verses, rooted in the truth of human nature, embodied the refined elegance of Wei and Meng, the serene simplicity of Tao and Liu.\n\nAlas, he was never granted a grand office to fully express his harmonious and pure cultivation—how rare such men are in this sagely age! Even now, among Xinjian’s students, those who once heard his words stand firm in their resolve. Was this not the fruit of his profound influence in nurturing integrity and discipline? Yet his learning was rooted in the Lu school, and those who venerate Zhu Xi may not embrace him. Thus, his steadfast independence and unwavering clarity remain little known. Nevertheless, when one examines the essence of his thought and the substance of his words, can they truly be dismissed?\n\nIf his teachings endure, they will surely serve as wings to the words of Zhou, Cheng, Zhu, and Lu. My friend Wu Bozong has composed his epitaph, but I lack the eloquence to amplify its praise. Thus, I offer this preface in lieu of refusal, recording the origins of his work.\"\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Yunxi’s Poetry Collection***\n\nMencius said: \"When the traces of the true kings faded, poetry perished; with poetry gone, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* arose.\" How difficult it is to speak of poetry! After the *Three Hundred Poems* and the ancient *fu*, the Han poets Su and Li, and the Wei masters Cao, Wang, Liu, and Ying, still drew near to the *Airs* and *Elegances*, beginning to transform them. By the early Jin, the likes of Ruan, Lu, Pan, and Zuo had not yet let the tradition decline. Later, in the Six Dynasties, Bao, Xie, Yan, and Zhang emerged, but their tones grew delicate and languid, their forms ornate and florid—the purity of the *Airs* and *Elegances* gradually dissipated.\n\nBy the early Tang, Song, Du, Chen, and Liu arose, followed in the High Tang by Wei, Liu, Wang, and Meng, whose spirit and cadence soared with unmatched vigor. Yet the one who synthesized it all was Du of Shaoling. Even contemporaries like Gao, Li, Cen, and Jia could not rival him. In his poetry, whether in adversity or prosperity, Du’s songs aligned with the *Airs* and *Elegances*, offering a model for all. By the late Tang, customs grew extravagant, and in the Song, only Su Shi, Mei Yaochen, Shi Yannian, Wang Anshi, Ouyang Xiu, the Su brothers, Zhu Xi, and Yang Wanli were deemed exemplary. In the Yuan, Fan, Yang, Yu, and Jie revived fading echoes, directly reviving the High Tang. For a time, scholars of the imperial academy and literati from all quarters took them as masters. In the regions between Jiangdong and Jiangxi, those who excelled in poetry flourished.\n\nThose who attained mastery within themselves found the vastness of the cosmos and mountains, the minutiae of flora and fauna—regardless of scale or beauty—stirring their hearts when perceived. Their diction and thought surged like rivers and seas, unstoppable. Thus, the literary men and ink-slingers of the age vied in splendor, arrayed like scales on a fish. Yet how many among them achieved grand and complete works, worthy of ascending to the ancients and serving as models for posterity?\n\nThe *Three Hundred Poems* were selected from the words of commoners and simple women, yet their satire, praise, and lament were fit for the ancestral temple, aiding governance and preserving the royal grace. If poetry perished and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* succeeded it, then poets must strive to revive what was lost. Yet later scholars, if they do not trace the source and follow the stream, if they do not arise from the correctness of a tranquil nature and the substance of self-cultivation, but instead chase after superficial imitation and embellishment, gleaning only the remnants of the ancients, merely dabbling in ink and plagiarizing fragments, racing to outdo one another in ephemeral verses of orchids and moonlight—how can they be deemed worthy of poetry?\n\nMy friend Yang Mengyu’s family is renowned for poetry. In my youth, I read his uncle Xianmin’s poems, though I regret not seeing them all. This spring, Mengyu was invited to tutor my nephew, and I lamented our late acquaintance as I studied his discourse and manner. He also presented several of his poems, which I read in full. Upon inquiring about his family, I learned that his ancestors, beginning with his great-uncle, were esteemed scholars, known as the \"Master of Guanzhong.\" By the Sui and Tang, many held prominent offices. One ancestor, whose name is recorded, served in Jiangxi and later settled in Shuibei Village, Jinxian County, during the first year of Gaozong’s *Linde* reign. In the Song, a certain Zhongbo passed the imperial examinations, served as magistrate of Changsha, and was later promoted to transport commissioner of Jiangxi before his death.\n\nThere was also one named Longwei, who likewise passed the imperial examinations and served as registrar of Poyang. His father’s younger brother and younger son both held office in the Yuan dynasty: the former as examiner in the Secretariat, later promoted to vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, and posthumously honored as minister of the same ministry. Thus the clan flourished with each generation, and those now dwelling in Shuibei number twenty-nine in descent.\n\nTheir learning originated with Shuneng, who studied under Wei Jianxiu, a student of the Song dynasty Imperial Academy, and Master Jianxin Weixian. Shuneng’s younger son Xianmin and his own younger son both received instruction from Shuneng, perpetuating the family’s scholarly tradition. Jianxin was refined in temperament and unassuming in demeanor; in his later years, he also admired Daoist teachings on seclusion and reclusion, inviting renowned masters to rigorously educate his sons. Mengyu is virtuous and erudite, his bearing and literary style marked by clarity, elegance, and breadth—modeled after Du Fu yet encompassing all poetic forms. Indeed, as a family of official rank for generations, their noble origins and long-cultivated scholarly refinement run deep.\n\nI am certain that neither worldly success nor obscurity disturbs his inner peace. Had he been placed among the ranks of the eminent, who is to say he could not have continued the sacred music of the ancestral temple, enriching the literary legacy of a flourishing age? Such is his aspiration toward the grand tradition of *Guofeng*, *Ya*, and *Song*. As for myself, unworthy as I am, exiled to remote mountains and dense forests, my mind wanders the desolate shores of wind and moonlight. My own shallowness has surely been refined by his brilliance, yet how could I fully comprehend Mengyu?\n\nYet I am struck by the rarity of those in this world who truly understand poetry—even Mengyu is seldom recognized. How few can soar beyond the ancients and contend with the Creator! When I asked about his uncle, my affection for him left me no choice but to await another day to do justice to his merits. Is this not so?\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Xu Clan Genealogy**\n\nI have read the *Rites of Zhou*, which states that the duty of the *xiaoshi* (minor historian) is to establish lineage, distinguish senior and junior branches, and thereby determine the order of the state. Though ancient times lacked genealogical records, the strict distinction between major and minor clans was maintained. Only after the decline of the clan system did emphasis shift to family status, giving rise to genealogical records. These serve to clarify lineage and distinguish degrees of kinship.\n\nYet those who compile genealogies often seek to glorify their ancestors and elevate their descendants. Whenever they encounter a prominent figure of the same surname, they invariably claim affiliation, fabricating connections to complete their records. Though such self-deception may bring temporary pride, it undermines the principles of honoring ancestors and clarifying lineage. How, then, can later generations trace their roots? This is why scholars and officials reject such practices.\n\nTracing further back, details grow scarce, and inaccuracies may arise. Some disregard a family’s historical standing or the purity of its customs, valuing only wealth and fame. They revere great households and prestigious lineages, yet how can they verify distinctions of antiquity, the origins of surnames, or the bestowal of clan names?\n\nThe Gaoyang Xu clan descends from the Marquis of Xu and the Lord of Qi in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. After the *Spring and Autumn* period, the state ceased to exist, and its descendants took the former fief as their surname. According to the genealogy, seven members of the Xu clan held marquisates in the Han dynasty, losing their titles only after Wang Mang’s downfall. In the Eastern Han, the upright official Xu Pan’s descendants settled in Runan, each branch gaining renown. Xu Jing served as Grand Tutor of Shu, while Xu Chu, in service to Wei, was enfeoffed as a marquis. In the Jin dynasty, Xu Zi was nominated as *xiaolian* but declined office; his descendants flourished in Gaoyang. Xu Shao was enfeoffed as Duke of Anlu in the Tang, and his grandson Jingzong became prime minister of Longxiang. Xu Riyuan died for righteousness during the *Tianbao* rebellion. In the Song *Xiangfu* era, Xu Sui served as director of the Directorate for Palace Buildings. Xu Yi, in the Yuan dynasty, was appointed pacification commissioner of Jianghuai, Jinghu, and the Two Zhe provinces. His descendants grew numerous and held successive court positions. One ancestor, through official promotion, was transferred to Yihuang in Fuzhou, where the family settled, becoming a prominent clan of Jiangyou.\n\nMy connection to the Xu family is one of kinship by marriage. My cousin Biyuan once entrusted me with their genealogy to compose a preface. I have long reflected on the inexorable cycles of prosperity and decline, glory and hardship—how profoundly they unfold without end! In my youth, I heard of the customs of old families, none more illustrious than those of the Yuan dynasty. Due to its long reign, its benevolence and generosity, and the flourishing of commerce, all who bore its legacy sought to revive and restore it. Thus, not only did extravagance and indulgence prevail, but the influence of poetry and books, along with the virtues of filial piety and brotherly love, still occasionally thrived.\n\nYet over thirty years have passed, and with the shift of fortune, all has changed. What once stood proud now lies in ruins. Is this not the inevitable ebb and flow of destiny? For those who uphold their family’s legacy through learning and conduct, without genealogical records to trace their lineage’s reach or the origins of their branches, how can the noble deeds and illustrious achievements of their ancestors avoid fading into obscurity? Few indeed are those who preserve their genealogies. That the Xu clan has so carefully safeguarded theirs, tracing their roots to officials of high rank and esteemed reputation, may be called a return to fundamentals and self-awareness.\n\nAlas, I have yet to meet the standard, but Biyuan’s words compel me. Thus, I offer this preface without hesitation.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Zeng Yu Fengzi***\n\nAll beings endowed with form and *qi* arise from non-being and ultimately return to it. Thus, form is borne by *qi*, and *qi* governs form. The primordial *qi* animates heaven and earth, while yin and yang operate within it. Heaven’s canopy, earth’s support, the radiance of the sun and moon, the sequence of the four seasons, the alternation of day and night, the transformations of ghosts and spirits, the multitude of the ten thousand things—all their ceaseless movements arise from the mutual generation and transformation of being and non-being.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in instructing others guided them solely toward the Dao. To understand the Dao is to grasp the mechanism of being and non-being, generation and transformation. Yet today’s so-called scholars pursue empty fame and superficial adornment, neglecting the inner for the outer. How can they silently seek and inwardly comprehend the interplay of being and non-being, generation and transformation?\n\nWhile dwelling in the mountains of Qi, I wandered leisurely beneath the pines where cranes roosted. There I encountered a Daoist, his hair wild and unkempt, who bowed and spoke: \"I have roamed rivers and seas for many years, once questioning extraordinary persons about the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar. I believe in Liezi’s teachings on the Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed, and that there are those who attain divine transformation through riding the wind. Though I do not yet know if I am capable, is it so—or is it not? I wish to have this clarified.\"\n\nI replied: \"Wind, as a thing, has sound but no form. Master Zhuang called it the great sigh of the cosmos. Does riding it truly rely on something? If what it relies upon is emptiness, how can one repeatedly attain fortune? If what it relies upon is not emptiness, how can fortune be attained at all—let alone repeatedly? Thus, it is difficult to escape dependence. How much better to move without relying on anything, to be without dependence on externals. Therefore, those who ride the correctness of heaven and earth and harness the transformations of the six qi to wander the boundless—what do they await? Liezi’s riding of the Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed is but the endless coming and going of a single qi, a reliance on riding the wind—yet what does it truly await? Thus, their wandering knows no rest, and its limits cannot be measured, let alone returning after fifteen days. To rest is to return, and to return is never without rest. This is how being rides upon non-being, and non-being governs being. When it reaches the state of neither being nor non-being, the mechanism of ceaseless generation and transformation is fully realized.\n\nIn your studies, you must seek the correctness of heaven and earth and the transformations of the six qi, cultivating them within yourself until, over months and years, form and spirit undergo dark transformation. Then, riding the boundless Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed, the wind moves without needing to be ridden. As for attaining fortune—it becomes something I have no use for. To abandon this and pursue other paths, even if one commands the winds of Feilian and the lightning of Lieque, rides the thunderous chariot of the storm, or traverses the starry roads of the clouds, how can one truly ride anything?\n\nYet all who approach the Dao must cast aside illusion, sever perceptual defilements, make their form like withered wood and their heart like dead ashes. They must regard the world’s treasures as dust and their own weighty bodies as clods of earth. Then, their self-reliance becomes light, and not even the entire world can burden their minds with so much as a hair’s weight. They move as if relying on emptiness, needing no vehicle yet knowing no bounds. Even beyond heaven and earth, their traces cannot be confined.\n\nYou, with your resolute nature and rigorous inquiry, must penetrate beyond being and non-being to wander the carefree wastes and boundless wilds. Like the roaring of ten thousand hollows, the emptiness of all openings—where nothing is heard, nothing is seen—what then are the earthly pipes of the hollows, the human pipes of bamboo flutes, or the heavenly pipes of the myriad winds? Only by listening to the soundless and seeing the formless can one realize that between being and non-being, all is but the myriad winds of a single breath. This is what those who seek the Creator rely upon. Yet I alone have not attained it—strive onward.\"\n\nThe Daoist then asked to adopt this as his name and recorded these words before parting.\n\n**Preface to the Zither Master Zhu Zongming**\n\nMusic’s power to bring harmony extends to the heavens and coils through the earth, moving through yin and yang and penetrating ghosts and spirits. Thus, grand music harmonizes with heaven and earth. Its resonance with things manifests in sound, and sound shaped into patterns is called tone. In tones arise joy and anger, sorrow and delight, exultation and grief, perversity and uprightness. This is why the noble person never parts with the zither and se for even a moment. As it is said: the zither is the essence of music, what the noble person ought to master.\n\nAll that enters the ears and eyes, all that fills the four limbs, must be regulated by ritual, and the zither suffices to dispel perversity, cleanse error, gladden the heart, and nurture the nature—thus attaining the correctness of human feelings. It is no different from the harmonious chimes of jade pendants or the refined sounds of the *Ya* and *Song* odes, which should not be silenced without cause.\n\nFrom the times of Fuxi, Shennong, Yu, Shun, King Wen, and Confucius down to the works of Boya, Qu Yuan, and Song Yu, some compositions arose from sorrowful thoughts, taking shape in mournful sighs or expressions of joy and choice. They begin with faint and distant notes, suddenly surging like anger; they end with a swift, stirring intensity, mournful as grief. In their urgency, they shake the wind and rain, splitting cliffs; in their slowness, they stir waves, rousing dragons. In their grandeur, they spur the gallop of unicorns and the brandishing of shields and axes; in their subtlety, they mimic the drip of springs and the whispers of insects. Their thousand forms and ten thousand postures cannot be fully described. Truly, they can rub against yin and yang and resonate with heaven and earth.\n\nYet to grasp this in the heart and express it through the hands requires long practice—how could it be otherwise? Only by attaining the correctness of human feelings can one preserve the lingering echoes of the sages and worthies. How could it be merely to please the vulgar ears and eyes of the masses?\n\nThe masters of old—Shi Xiang, Shi Kuang, and Shi Wen—are long gone. Those who came after, modifying their teachings—Yongmen Zhou, Sima Xiangru, Cai Dang, Sun Deng, Ji Kang, Huan Tan, and Yang Shou—each excelled in their own way. Among those renowned in recent times for this art are Xu Zifang of Xiaoshan, Yuan Minzhong, and Mao Bozhen. Yang, who studied under Xu and Yuan, rose to prominence in his time as Qi Ling. His *Two Compositions of Jiang* became models, and later generations took Xu and Yuan as their standard.\n\nFrom my youth, I have been devoted to this study. In great cities, whenever I encountered someone skilled in it, I would inquire. Yet most who claim mastery today merely boast of their abundance and compete in extravagance. Those whose tones are bold and transcendent, whose spirit soars to distant realms, are exceedingly rare.\"\n\nThe Fujian scholar Zhu Zongming studied under Yuan Ling, a friend of mine. This spring, he came to travel through our mountains, and together we swept the stone drums by Xian Spring. His melodies and tunes were all pure, profound, elegant, and refined—bold and transcendent, soaring and unrestrained—truly beyond comparison with those who merely boast of their abundance and compete in extravagance. In his discussions, he invariably took the attainment of the true nature of feeling as essential. In his youth, he traveled widely, drawing from many sources. At the beginning of our dynasty, he was first recommended to the capital but firmly declined and returned. All the great families and prominent clans of Fujian vied to invite him. Yet only now, in his advanced years, has he attained the subtleties of sound—surely not the work of a single day.\n\nAs the ancients said of \"lofty mountains and flowing waters,\" he found in him one with whom to cultivate the spirit and express the heart amid wind-swept forests and moonlit cliffs. When he departed, how could I not dream of the celestial sounds and surging waves of his music? And what indeed were those tones of *Huangzhong* and *Baixue*? I feared only that my ears could never forget them. As he left, I took up my zither and played *The Debate by the Stream*, strumming twice without ever sensing the sound of parting.\n\nThus, I write this preface as a gift for his journey.\n\n**Preface to \"Roaming the Immortal Crags\"**\n\nI have often observed how people differ in their stillness and restlessness, their toil and ease. Their conduct and speech, their silence and expression, inevitably reveal the inclinations of their nature—how could these be forced? If forced, how could they ever reach the truth of such inclinations?\n\nOur mountain’s Immortal Crags, numbering twenty-four in all, have long been renowned throughout the land. Since the Han-era Celestial Master refined his elixir here, dragons and tigers have appeared in the rocks, lending the place its name. From then on, scholars near and far—regardless of rank, age, or strength—who passed by or made a special pilgrimage never failed to wish for a visit. Thus, boats and oars have come and gone without cease, month after month, year after year.\n\nOn the sixth day of the ninth lunar month in the *bingzi* year of the Hongwu reign, I set forth with my academy guests—Master Yang Mengxu, my second brother Zhan Bi, my nephew Wu Ruxu—and our attendants Wang Jingshan, Wu Chuyuan, and Yuan Zhi’an. We ordered a boat to be readied at the creek’s cleansing waters, loaded wine and provisions, then cast off, riding the waves past islets until we arrived in no time at all.\n\nThat evening, we rested to the left of the Crags at the *Yanfa Abbey*, the shrine of the Han-era Celestial Master. Towering terraces and soaring pavilions pierced the heavens, while water curtains draped the altar platforms, cinnabar turtles and mushroom crags arrayed to either side—all offered respite for our repose. The next dawn, we embarked again, the boatmen’s poles and gestures guiding us up and down in ceaseless succession, leaving no leisure to admire the winding paths. Yet among the isles and shores, strange rocks and rare trees, secluded blossoms and exotic blooms flourished in lush, fragrant profusion, each vying in solitary splendor.\n\nSoon we turned toward the shallows, skirting coves where the boat’s hull scraped hidden hollows and jagged crevices—places where only birds could perch or cling, and no human trace could reach. Some coves nestled deep in forests and narrow valleys, sheltering fishermen’s huts; others lay concealed by wild thickets and overgrown islets, where woodcutters’ trails wound in meandering seclusion. This was scarcely different from the Peach Blossom Spring of Wuling. Presently, we paused to brew tea by the stream, drifting downstream as sheer cliffs and precipitous crags reared up in sudden fury—some like leaping dragons and bounding leopards, others like crouching tigers and coiled serpents. Those that bowed low formed natural screens and barriers, while clouds surged and mists billowed in endless transformations. Where hollows gaped in the towering rocks, kitchens, granaries, windows, and weaving looms seemed fully furnished within, inspiring awe and longing as one gazed upward. The mind dissolved, the spirit released, one truly forgot the mortal world existed.\n\nBelow, the limpid pool shimmered in emerald clarity, while ethereal harmonies arose on all sides. Yet above, soaring into the azure skies and brilliant sunlight, only jagged peaks and towering ridges stood—verdant ravines and intricate ridges woven together. In the distance, wild waves and shallow shoals, solemn streams and muddy shallows stretched on without end. After a long while, we disembarked at the base of the Crags, securing our robes to ascend. Suspended boulders hung like canopies over the void, spacious enough to seat dozens. There we laid out wine cups and dishes, drinking our fill. Some recited poetry, others plucked the zither, still others sketched the scene—thus we passed the day in delight, lingering until evening.\n\nJust then, a western wind arose, as if urging us to tread the void and ride the floating clouds, our spirits irrepressible. We ordered the boat to seek the Crags’ right flank, where the *Mingcheng Abbey*—the *Hetu* Immortal Altar of Grand Master Wu—stood. Night had fallen by the time we lit torches to hasten to our lodging. Our host, a descendant of the Wu clan named Congshan, was well-versed in divination and astrology. We conversed through the night, departing the next morning. The poems we composed filled our sleeves, forming a scroll before we knew it.\n\nMengxu then arranged them in order and declared: “Life is for joy alone. These famed mountains and rivers are the dwelling places of immortals and perfected beings—I have heard of them for years. They are no less wondrous than Penglai, Weifeng, Fanghu, or Yuanjiao. Many long to visit but never can. Some hear of them and dismiss the tales as fantastical exaggerations, refusing to believe. Yet today, by good fortune, we have beheld them with our own eyes. The realms of Anqi and Xianmen, the flights of immortals and feasts of leviathans, all lie within a blink’s reach—how could we not count ourselves fortunate? I beg you to preface these works, to record this gathering’s splendor and leave it for posterity.”\n\nI could not refuse and sighed in assent: “Since the dawn of creation, heaven and earth have stood in their places, and mountains and rivers have flourished. These Crags have towered through endless eons, never crumbling. For thousands upon thousands of years before us, who can say how many cycles of rise and fall, growth and decay they have witnessed? How many have shared in this joy? For thousands upon thousands of years to come, who can say how many will know this same delight? Yet those entangled in worldly glory, drowned in mundane filth, buffeted by stormy gloom or the vicissitudes of human affairs—how vast is the gulf between them and those who wander here! This journey, with its pleasures of poetry, music, and song, need not yield to the famed excursions of Red Cliff or the Ke River. How could I remain silent?”\n\nMoreover, the restless yearn for stillness, the weary long for ease—yet how many truly grasp the essence of nature’s truth? Thus, I gladly acceded to his request and composed this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Huanzhen Collection***\n\nThe Dao of immortality has been revered since antiquity. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Way from Guangchengzi, the school of Huang-Lao arose, for Guangcheng was none other than Laozi. Thus began the teachings of immortality. In the Tang, there was Qian Keng; in the Xia, Xiaofu; in the Shang, Wuanqiu; and in the Zhou, Wang Qiao of the Zhou clan—such figures existed even in the Three Dynasties. Yet it was King Mu of Zhou who built a thatched pavilion to receive scholars, bringing their doctrines into prominence.\n\nLater, the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han were deluded by the arts of alchemists and elixirs. Even Wang Cizhong and Dongfang Shuo, though of their time, failed to find true masters. Their heterodox teachings spread and intermingled, ultimately leading to their downfall. Thus, the great scholars and eminent minds of the age rose together to condemn them—rightly so.\n\nYet in the Han, Wei Boyang modeled his *Cantong Qi* after the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic*. Through this, the Dao of the Elixir was illuminated, free from the pitfalls of metallurgy, herbalism, cloud-gazing, or breathwork. It clarified the natural principles of body, mind, spirit, and vitality, using the trigrams, lines, and timekeeping to establish its rules—all harmonizing with the patterns of odd and even, images and numbers.\n\nLater, Zhongli Quan transmitted his teachings to Lü Yan of the Tang, who upheld and expounded them in songs, discourses, and debates, nearing the true essence of the tradition. Such figures have never been lacking through the ages. In the Song, Zhang Ziyang, Shi Xinglin, Chen Niuwan, Bai Ziqing, Li Yuxi, and Li Qing’an—all were outstanding masters of their time. Their words and ideas were no less profound than Boyang’s, each achieving deep, silent understanding in their own way.\n\nThe span of a thousand or ten thousand years—how is it that their words align as if tallying broken seals? This is no coincidence, but the natural outcome. For the principles of a thousand or ten thousand generations remain the same, as do the hearts of men. What causes divergence is invariably the perverse and deceptive doctrines, either contrived to impress the present age or to delude later generations—how could these ever truly accord with the natural Dao of body, mind, spirit, and qi?\n\nThus, the ancients invariably transmitted their teachings only to the worthy, for the Dao does not spread in vain. Moreover, if a master does not guard the profound and abstruse mysteries, refusing to reveal them indiscriminately, while the learner lacks the solid foundation of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct—merely adorning themselves with empty formalities and pretense, no different from those who chase fame and self-aggrandizement—how could they ever speak of the Dao? How could they give voice to its truths?\n\nThe Master of Hunran of Linjiang in Nanchang, once of another surname, was broadly learned. Having encountered an extraordinary person and received secret transmissions, he remained diligent in discourse and writing. I have long read his words, and though we met briefly at an inn, haste prevented a thorough inquiry. This spring, my disciple Yuan Wenyi returned from Wu, bringing his work *The Collection of Returning to the True*, and asked me to inscribe a preface. After savoring it twice, I find it truly conveys the essence of the Golden Elixir and the returning cinnabar, elucidating both the subtle and the manifest, the principle and its application. If one cultivates accordingly, even those who ascend to meet Ziyang or Qing’an may find themselves neither ahead nor behind.\n\nI have long lamented the enduring corruption of superficial, reckless, and heterodox habits in the world, which seem impossible to eradicate entirely. Yet I rejoice that these words may serve to rouse and rectify the ills of this declining age. If steadfast scholars and upright individuals possess the discernment to distinguish fine jade from common stone, then wandering in the primordial radiance of the undifferentiated chaos, refining qi beyond the merging of primordial mists, will be no difficult feat. This is how one fully grasps the return to the origin and the consummation of the end, exhausting the divine and comprehending transformation.\n\nPerhaps one day, I may summon the yellow crane to descend from the skies, and together we shall discuss these matters by the rivers and isles of the Xiang—there is still time. This preface stands at the beginning of the compilation.\n\n*Jianquan Collection, Scroll Two* concludes.\n*Jianquan Collection, Scroll Three*?\n?\n*Jianquan Collection, Scroll Four*\n\nMaster Qishan, the Celestial Master of Non-Action, Zhang Yuchu, presents:\n\n**On the *Tai Su* and the Sayings of Liezi**\n\nLiezi spoke of the sequence: There is *Tai Yi* (Supreme Change), *Tai Chu* (Supreme Beginning), *Tai Shi* (Supreme Commencement), and *Tai Su* (Supreme Simplicity).\n\n*Tai Yi* is the state before qi emerges. *Tai Chu* is the beginning of qi. *Tai Shi* is the beginning of form. *Tai Su* is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet undivided, this is called *hunlun* (primordial chaos). *Hunlun* describes the state where the myriad things are intermingled and inseparable.\n\nQi is the origin of form and substance. Before yin and yang separate, its body is *hunlun*. Once divided, it is carved and chiseled, and the *hundun* (chaos) dies—*hunlun* is lost. Yet these three—qi, form, and substance—constantly encompass beginning and end, cycling and interweaving. Outwardly, they appear separate, but in the fleeting interplay of growth and decay, they never depart from *hunlun*. For qi courses through heaven and earth as wind, rain, frost, and dew, as mountains, rivers, and valleys. Within humans and all things, it manifests as the four limbs and the hundred bones. Though creatures fly or burrow, move or grow, each unique in its myriad forms, all are confined by form and substance.\n\nThe beginning of qi, unseen, remains unfathomable. Yet its fullness in substance can be exhaustively explored. The azure of the sky is the true color of the Great Void, pristine and clear. But when darkness and transformation arise in an instant, the azure hue becomes obscured. Without these shifts of darkness and change, the fullness of heaven’s nature cannot be realized.\n\nHumans receive the purity of qi and substance. When passions flare and desires overflow, hardness and softness, good and evil become manifest—this dilutes their purity, mixes their essence, and stains their clarity. Yet if substance were utterly undifferentiated, how could the fullness of human nature be expressed? All things follow this principle. In motion and stillness, advance and retreat, none withhold their nature.\n\nThus, the substance of things, without adornment, lacks splendor. The true flavor of taste, without salt or bitterness, lacks harmony. The subtlety of sound, without pitch and rhythm, lacks concord. This is the inevitable nature of things. Humans must curb desire to return to their origin, so that purity is not diluted, essence not mixed, and clarity not stained. Then the luminous body of pure brightness becomes fully evident. Here we see that our hardness and softness, good and evil, are like heaven’s fleeting darkness and change—yet the original purity of our substance remains unmoved in stillness or motion.\n\nNevertheless, those in the world who uphold this teaching for self-cultivation may nurture purity but fail to wander in *Tai Su*. Without wandering in *Tai Su*, how can they perceive the origin of substance? Substance endures, while adornment decays. Substance nourishes, while adornment pleases. Those who aspire to the Dao must shed adornment to return to substance. By returning to substance, the mind becomes clear, the spirit bright, and inner and outer align in integrity. The myriad things merge in *hunlun* yet remain undivided—is this not perceiving their origin?\n\nThe scholar Lian Taisu of Wudang Mountain’s Five Dragons Palace has studied broadly and conducted himself with rectitude. He has dwelled on our mountain for over twenty years, steadfast in practice, residing in quietude within a single chamber, untouched by the world. My late father once honored him, and since I inherited this teaching, I have drawn much from his inquiries into our Daoist traditions. Could he not wander in *Tai Su* and yet remain thus? This autumn, he wished to return home, and though I urged him to stay, he declined. I said to him: \"From ancient times, famous mountains and rivers have been the abodes of immortals and perfected beings. Why limit yourself to returning here? Yet I have heard this mountain’s wonders surpass all under heaven. Are there not recluses like Anqi or Xianmen hidden within its peaks? Taisu, you should seek their company to expand your *hunlun* and return to the primordial state before the merging of mists, transcending the confines of form and qi. What more would you seek of the origin of substance?\"\n\nAs he prepared to depart, I combined these teachings for him. Lian gladly requested that I record them as a keepsake.\n\n**The Pure One’s Discourse**\n\nAh Jiang’s Zhang Yanhong comes from a family of renowned virtue. Last spring, I visited Xishan and Hua Gai, passing through Ah Jiang on my return, where I first met him. I admired his sincere and earnest demeanor, and in conversation, learned of his fervent pursuit of our Daoist teachings. He has styled himself \"The Pure One.\" Upon his departure, I had no time to discuss these matters. This spring, he came to visit my mountain. My younger brother, Yankui, and I accompanied him to the peaks of Longjing, Guancheng Lake, Pipa, Yuntai, and Miaogu, where we bathed in raging currents and sat upon boulders, roaming as if with heaven itself, forgetting the world of men.\n\nYanhong then asked: \"You once spoke of my name, 'The Pure One.' Now that I have had the honor of this journey, may I inquire into its meaning?\" I pointed to the water and said to him: \"Water is a tranquil thing. From deep sources and hidden ravines, it gathers in a single, limpid pool. Yet when it surges from its lair, leaping and tumbling through a hundred turns, it flows downward for thousands of miles—vast as rivers and seas, narrow as streams and valleys. It rages against rocks, howls in the wind. Though obstructed by thorns, it may be blocked; though fouled by filth, it may be muddied. Fish and dragons dwell in its depths, forests and trees shade its seclusion, wind and rain darken its moisture—nothing can impede its flow. Day and night, it never ceases, its momentum unstoppable, for this is the nature of its encounter.\n\nYet in its essence, it is inherently clear. Thorns cannot block it, filth cannot muddy it. It embraces all yet illuminates all—this is the work of primordial qi. The Dao’s principle of method originates in qi. Water flows between heaven and earth as qi flows within the body. In the space of a single breath, movement and stillness, fullness and emptiness, growth and decay are all present.\n\nThe human heart governs qi. Fundamentally pure and bright, its emptiness and luminosity are like a limpid pool. Yet when it pursues desire and is obscured, moved by external things, if one does not apply the effort to restrain and refine it, it becomes enslaved by the outer world, stumbling and entangled—like water surging from its lair, its momentum unstoppable. Its qi scatters into thoughts, emotions, and desires, becoming blocked and muddied as it should.\"\n\nThus, the sages and worthies instruct us to guard and restrain the heart, precisely to awaken it from error, restore its flow, and make its seeking akin to water’s response to what it encounters. Its purity and luminosity are never truly lost; the radiance remains, and this is called the Dao in motion, the method in operation. Then, circulating through the six directions of emptiness, moving in harmony with heaven and earth without conflict, it manifests as wind, rain, thunder, and lightning—ever-present as if inherent. Why is this so? For the numerical patterns of the Yellow River and Luo River, the Way of thunder and lightning, and the ceaseless generation of the myriad beings all share a single origin. Thus, to cultivate it is to attain supreme harmony; to apply it is to achieve supreme divinity. Through sincerity, it polishes and refines; through earnest devotion, it penetrates and communicates. Then, the wondrous efficacy of its resonance is as effortless as turning one’s palm.\n\nYet there are subtle and mysterious workings of spirits and gods, rarely spoken of by others, which I also employ. This requires absolute purity to achieve unity; once unified, the Way of nature and destiny is complete—what further method could be needed? Therefore, by observing the nature of things, one knows one’s own nature; by fully realizing one’s own nature, one knows Heaven. Knowing Heaven, the Heaven within oneself is the same as that beyond. In the Way of resonance and communion, who can divide them into two?\n\nThus, those who cultivate inwardly often feign madness or indulge in wine, their laughter and rage alike capable of summoning wind and commanding thunder. Yet how could this be mere happenstance? Yan Hong has thoroughly investigated the profound subtleties of the method and the work of purity and unity, practicing and verifying it through experience—what more need be said? Moreover, I have heard that among his ancestors were those who attained the Dao and transcended the mundane. His deep devotion to this pursuit—could it not be the echo of past cultivation?\n\nYan Hong, take heed. As one who dwells in the same village as the Perfected Lord of the Celestial King’s Court, you must revive this legacy to enlighten future generations. This is my hope. At his request, I have inscribed these words upon the wall.\n\n**On the Learning of the Great Foundation**\nThe great foundation of learning lies in nature and destiny, in the Dao and virtue alone. The heart governs nature and emotion, while nature is bestowed by the mandate of Heaven. The four seasons, five phases, and the transformations of the myriad beings all emerge from destiny. The four beginnings, five constants, and the ten thousand things and affairs all reside within nature. Yet though the myriad things differ, their principle is never not one. Thus, to follow it is called the Dao; to cultivate it is called teaching. Yet one must study to know it.\n\nLearning begins with filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trust, and culminates in the rituals of ascent, descent, toasting, and drinking—there is no moment when one does not learn. The Classics call this learning. It originates in the *Shu Jing*, which states, *\"Study the ancient teachings to gain insight,\"* and *\"Hold fast to the beginning and end, relying on learning.\"* This is the learning of the sages.\n\nThe sages and worthies, fully comprehending the impartiality of Heaven’s principle, possess a body of clarity, purity, and integrity. The foolish and unworthy, drowning in the selfishness of human desire, fall into obscurity, turbidity, and perversity. Thus, those who study seek to remove their obstructions and restore the inherent goodness within. Therefore, one must thoroughly investigate the Way of fully realizing nature and fulfilling destiny, of illuminating goodness and embodying sincerity.\n\nThus, ritual and righteousness serve as its standards and boundaries; speech and conduct are its means of nurturing and reflection. Yet one must honor teachers and befriend the virtuous to attain it. Abide in reverence, act in accordance with righteousness, and over time, it enters the ears, takes root in the heart, and permeates all without exception.\n\nConsider this: Zaofu excelled in charioteering, Yi in archery, Shi Kuang in tuning, Zhui in bow-making, Xizhong in carriage-crafting, and Du in horsemanship. Even in such minor skills, they focused their intent before achieving mastery. How much more so for learning—the work of sages and worthies!\n\nConfucius, though already a sage, did not consider himself one, saying, *\"At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.\"* From that time to a thousand generations hence, who could surpass his sageliness? Yet he still dedicated himself to learning.\n\nIn ancient times, the institutions of learning took different names: in the Tang and Yu dynasties, it was called *Chengjun*; in the Yin, *Taixue* or *Guzong*; in the Zhou, *Taixue* was in the eastern suburbs, and the elementary school was called *Yuxiang*. The Han and Tang dynasties developed these further. Yet even the sage-kings of Tang and Yu never ceased to learn: Yao studied under Jun Chou, Shun under Wu Chengzhao, Yu under Xi Wangguo, Tang under Cheng Zibo, King Wen under Shi Zisi, and King Wu under Guo Shu. Even Confucius once inquired about ritual from Laozi, sought music from Chang Hong, and asked about the *Yi* from Xi Ze. Mencius studied under the disciples of Zisi, and Xunzi under Zou Yan. This is the transmission of the Confucians.\n\nLater, Dong Zhongshu and Han Yu continued this lineage, ultimately seeking the return to the mean, uprightness, benevolence, and righteousness, firmly rooted in self-cultivation. Those who draw from the rich essence of the Six Classics, refined within and flourishing without, are capable of assisting in the generation and nurturing of all things, manifesting the supreme harmony. This is expressed in writing, weaving together the warp and weft to bear the Dao.\n\nThus, the instruments of *heng*, *huang*, *tang*, and *li*, the vessels of *yi*, *ding*, *jian*, and *guan*—without adornment, one knows they are the sacred implements of the ancestral temple. How could they be compared to those who, like thieves of bronze and iron, boast of empty embellishments, competing in ornate carvings and trivial decorations to curry favor?\n\nIf one cannot reach the realm of uprightness, grandeur, and luminosity, but merely vies in the petty and trivial, how can this be called learning? One must grasp its essence and attain completion. Compared to those who gain from teachers and friends, it is as if one had merely memorized formulas or molded clay—achieving nothing without effort.\n\nFor what is gained from within—the subtleties of the Dao, the profundity of learning—fills and illuminates, daily expanding one’s vision. Brocade and embroidery cannot be called splendor; mats, tripods, jade tablets, and sashes cannot be called honor. Even the humblest of silk threads or grains of millet, the simplest of cups or plainest of water, do not diminish the joy of one who has attained this.\n\nYet is this not because even the slightest hindrance could burden one’s heart? Still, the swiftest steed cannot cover ten paces in a single leap, while the slowest horse, through tenfold perseverance, achieves success by never abandoning the effort. Though their destinations may differ in speed, the distinction lies in whether one ceases or persists. Such is the unwearying resolve of the sage.\n\nMy young nephew, so-and-so, is of pure and keen disposition, devoted to learning. He once asked his elder brother, so-and-so, to name his study \"Daily Progress in Learning\" and requested a few words to expound its meaning. As for my own learning, I have merely explored the byways without entering the gate—how could I presume to enlighten him? Yet I urge him to strive on, so that his practice becomes consummate and his conduct illustrious. Then I shall witness his accomplishments, which shall be boundless and immeasurable. This is my explanation, offered in anticipation.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Lady Zixu, the Primordial Sovereign**\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign was surnamed Wei, named Huacun, styled Xian’an, and was a native of Rencheng. She was the daughter of Wei Shu, Minister of Works during the Jin dynasty, and was born in the third year of the Jiaping reign of King Qi of Wei (251 CE). Of extraordinary natural endowment, she read the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi in her youth and soon came to revere the Dao, delighting in seclusion and solitude. At the age of twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu Wen of Nanyang, styled Youyan, by whom she bore two sons, Pu and Xia. Youyan served as Magistrate of Xiuwu in Jijun. Once her two sons were grown, she purified her heart, withdrew to a separate chamber, abstained from food and drink, and resumed her original practice.\n\nOn the night of the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of the ninth year of the Taikang reign (288 CE), the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Divine King of Fusang’s Yang Valley, the Perfected of Jinglin, and the Perfected of Qingxu descended and addressed the Primordial Sovereign: \"Having heard of your secret cultivation of true qi, the Supreme Emperor has commanded us to transmit to you the Way of the Divine Perfected.\" Thereupon, they presented thirty-one scrolls, including the *Treasure Writ of the Supreme Lord*, the *Hidden Book of the Eight Simplicities*, the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and the *Mysteries of the Lofty Immortals*, saying: \"These texts were once bestowed upon the Lord of Total Perfection of the Western City; now we entrust them to you.\" They also instructed her in the secrets of visualization and the essentials of return before departing. At that time, the Primordial Sovereign was thirty-seven years old.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Xianhe reign (334 CE), the Lord of Qingxu and the Azure Lads descended again, presenting her with two doses of elixir and commanding her to ingest them in preparation for a meeting at the Palace of Luoyang at an appointed time. On the night of the seventh day of that month, the Supreme Unity dispatched a terrace chariot to welcome her. Employing the Way of Concealed Radiance, the Primordial Sovereign entrusted her form to the divine sword and transformed, having lived eighty-three years. She then proceeded to Yangluo Mountain.\n\nThe following day, the Lord of Qingxu, the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Divine King of Qingxu descended once more, meeting the Primordial Sovereign at the Cloud Terrace of the Hidden Grotto. Each Perfected imparted their ultimate teachings, and after three days, they departed. The Primordial Sovereign had recited the Jade Scriptures so extensively that her complexion remained that of a young maiden. Thereupon, the Queen Mother of the West and the Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen came to welcome her. Ascending at dawn to the Jade Tower of the Palace of Supreme Clarity, the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Dawn, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, and the Later Sage Lord of the Golden Watchtower each issued decrees, bestowing upon her jade tablets and golden writs. She was invested as the Primordial Sovereign of Zixu, charged with overseeing the life-destinies of the Upper Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, her rank equivalent to that of an Immortal Duke. She was further entrusted with governance of the Central Terrace of Tiantai and the Great Huo Mountain, where she would instruct those who sought immortality. The Perfected of the Life-Destiny Office of the Immortals were placed under her jurisdiction in the Southern Marchmount.\n\nThe various Perfected then accompanied the Primordial Sovereign to Tiantai and the Central Terrace of the Great Huo Mountain. Passing through Jinqu’s Golden Altar, they were hosted by the Mao Lords, Shu and Shen, for a two-day feast before proceeding to Huo Mountain.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the sixth month of the second year of the Xingding reign (1219 CE), the Primordial Sovereign and the host of Perfected descended to the Golden Altar of Jinqu at the home of Yang Xi, marking the beginning of the Huayang transmission. Thus, she became the first patriarch of the Supreme Clarity lineage. During the Yuanyou reign of the Song dynasty, she was posthumously enfeoffed as the Primordial Sovereign of Zixu, the Illustrious and Profound Dao of the Supreme Mystery.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Jin Ye’an**\n\nJin Pengtou, a native of Yongjia, was named Zhiyang and styled Ye’an. His unkempt hair, gathered into a single topknot, earned him the sobriquet \"Pengtou\" (\"Disheveled Head\"). Born into a family of virtuous repute in his hometown, he was resolute and daring from childhood, possessing great aspirations and an untamed spirit. As he matured, he came to yearn for the Dao and relinquished worldly concerns, becoming a disciple of Li Yuexi of the Quanzhen tradition. Yuexi, a disciple of Bai Ziqing, recognized his potential upon their first meeting and dispatched him to travel through Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Chu in search of true teachings. Later, upon studying with the eminent master Li Zhenchang, he gained even deeper insight.\n\nPassing through Yuanzhou, he encountered Dian Junzi, a garrison commander of imposing yet unadorned appearance, who shunned worldly company by day and lodged in spirit shrines by night. Ye’an, struck by his singularity, took him as his master. With time, their exchanges yielded ever deeper understanding.\n\nAt that time, Zou Tingsuo of Zishan, an admirer of the Dao, built the Changchun Abbey and paid homage to him. Shortly after, he entrusted the abbey’s affairs to his disciple Liu Zhixuan and journeyed to the two sacred mountains of Wuyi and Longhu. There, Fu Shizheng, the master of the Xiantian Abbey on Longhu Mountain, lodged him at Penglai Hermitage, situated at the confluence of the ruins of the Recluse, the Sacred Well, and Miaogu Peaks. Ye’an scaled cliffs and ravines, mingled with deer and boars, and slept amidst clouds and mist as though it were ordinary. By night, he would sit upon a boulder, and when serpents or tigers appeared before him, they would startle and flee. Thus he came upon a level, open expanse, where he commanded his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to construct Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak.\n\nAs his reputation for the Dao spread, people from near and far afflicted by illness sought him out. Whatever fruits he offered them proved efficacious without fail, and so those who came to pay their respects grew daily. Once, during a drought, he knocked upon the Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth. The dragon emerged to listen, its form gradually diminishing until it leapt into his sleeve. He admonished it sternly, whereupon the dragon surged back into the water, and rain fell before long.\n\nIn the *guiyou* year of the Yuantong era (1333), he withdrew once more to Wuyi Mountain, residing at the Zhizhi Hermitage of Ziqing. Li Taiping, the Yuan Marshal of Zhedong, heard of him and paid him homage, saying: \"When commands are strict, the lord governs; when the mind is clear, cares diminish.\" Li was all the more filled with reverence and admiration.\n\nWhen the rebel Li Zhifu invaded Zhangzhou, the imperial court appointed Prefect Wu to oversee the suppression of the bandits and named him vanguard commander. Wu’s son, Zhongliang, wished to become Ye’an’s disciple, but he refused. Soon after, the rebels were indeed vanquished. As the throng of spirits and deities grew weary of the constant petitioners, they plotted to poison him. Foreknowing this, he ordered his disciples to dig a pit in the earth, whereupon the poison was expelled. The site is now called the Elixir-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month of the *zhi-yuan* era (1335), his fellow adept Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—attained liberation while seated at Mount Lu. Ye’an soon learned of this. On the tenth day of the fourth month, he instructed his disciples to record his final admonitions and passed away in meditation. Thirteen days later, his face remained as though flushed, and his limbs retained their warmth and suppleness as in life. His disciples interred him beneath an ancient plum tree beside the hermitage.\n\nHe was born on the fourth day of the fifth month of the *bingzi* year of the Zhiyuan era (1276). His foremost disciples—Lao Yansu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\nMang Miaozi remarked: \"The resolute men and righteous knights of old invariably endured hardship and purified themselves to fulfill their aspirations. Thus they regarded the rending of flesh and the breaking of sinew as matters of course, and by their towering singularity, they left examples for a thousand generations. Such was Jin Pengtou. Yet if one seeks to establish a name in the world, one must first attain such resolve—how much more so for those who transcend illusion and transformation? Those capable of such attainment yet failing to achieve the Dao are unheard of. Alas, how few in any age have been capable of this!\"\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Zhao Yuanyang**\n\nZhao Yuanyang, whose given name was Yizhen, was a native of Anfu in Ji Prefecture. His ancestors hailed from Junyi, and he was a thirteenth-generation descendant of Zhao Dezhao, the Prince of Yan during the Song Dynasty. His forebear served as magistrate of Anfu under the Yuan and settled there. Yuanyang was precocious in childhood, quick to learn, and adept at recitation. He mastered the classics, histories, and the writings of the Hundred Schools, and in his youth pursued the path of the imperial examinations. Soon after, he sat for the metropolitan examination but withdrew due to illness. His condition persisted, and one night he dreamed of a divine figure who said: \"You are a man of my Dao—why do you seek worldly eminence?\" His father then directed him toward the Dao, and thereafter he became deeply devoted to tranquility and detachment. His learning advanced ever further.\n\nAt first, he studied under a man of the Dao in his commandery, one Zeng Chenwai, and inherited the essential teachings. Where texts were incomplete, he would invariably seek out and verify them in exhaustive detail. Later, he became a disciple of Zhang Tianquan of Taiyu Abbey in Ji, also known as Iron Mystery Zhang, who had himself studied under Jin Yea of Mount Longhu and received the oral instructions for the inner and outer elixirs of golden fluid. Subsequently, he studied under Li Xuanyi of Nanchang, who recommended him to his own master, Master Feng of the Robes of Rushes, who had also been a disciple of Yea. It was said that he once traveled to Yongxing Abbey on White Crane Mountain, the former site of the immortal Kuang of the Western Jin, and took up residence there. When asked about the methods he had been taught for summoning thunder and rain or refining the essence-spirit, he invariably elicited extraordinary responses, and those who heard of him would travel a thousand *li* to seek his instruction.\n\nIn the year *renchen*, as war broke out, he journeyed west to Wu and Shu with his disciples, and upon his return, he traveled to Mount Wudang, visited Mount Longhu, and sought out the vestiges of the Celestial Master of Han. At that time, the Celestial Master Chongxu deeply admired and honored him, wishing to detain him, but he declined. Many of the abbey’s scholars then became his disciples. On his return, he stayed at Ziyang Abbey in Yudu of Ganzhou and settled there. He compiled all the profound principles of the Daoist canon into written works. At times, he composed poems and songs to admonish himself, while also using medicine to aid others. In seclusion, he spoke little and laughed seldom, yet those who heard of him longed to pay him homage, though few were granted the opportunity. His lofty conduct and noble character were revered and admired by his contemporaries, and his followers grew ever more numerous.\n\nIn the first month of the year *rentu*, on the first day of the new year, he addressed his disciples, saying: “I shall soon depart. From this day forth, I shall seal myself in silent retreat—take care that none disturb me.” On the third day of the fifth month, the summer solstice, he emerged, exhorted his disciples to stand firm in their own practice, rinsed his mouth, bathed, changed his robes, and sat in meditation. Just as the county magistrate arrived with an imperial edict to perform music in celebration, he wrote a final poem, cast aside his brush, and passed away. Thunder and lightning suddenly erupted, and the daylight turned to darkness. The following day, officials and commoners who came to pay their respects gathered in great numbers. His disciples were dispatched to the regions of Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Chu to seek further instruction. When they consulted the former virtuous Li Zhenchang, they gained even deeper insight.\n\nPassing through Yuanzhou, he encountered the garrison commander Junzi of Dian’s army, a man of imposing and unadorned appearance who by day held no commerce with the world and by night lodged in spirit shrines to inquire. Struck by his unkempt head, he took him as master. As time deepened, his words yielded ever greater insight.\n\nAt that time, Zou Tingzuo of Zishan, drawn to the Dao, built the Changchun Abbey and paid him homage. Before long, he charged his disciple Liu Zhixuan with overseeing the abbey’s affairs and journeyed to the two mountains of Wuyi and Longhu. At Longhu, the master of the Xiantian Abbey was Fu Shizheng, who lodged at Penglai Hermitage, a ruined sanctuary at the confluence of Zhengjun, Shengjing, and Miaogu peaks. With disheveled hair, he scaled cliffs and ravines, called to deer and boars, and reclined upon clouds and mists as though it were ordinary. By night he sat upon a flat boulder, and when serpents and tigers appeared before him, they would startle and flee. Thus he came upon a level and open tract of land, where he commanded his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to build Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak.\n\nAs his Dao became renowned far and wide, those near and far afflicted with illness would seek him out. Whatever fruits he offered them proved efficacious without fail, and so those who came to pay their respects gathered in ever greater numbers. Once, during a drought, he knocked upon the Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth to speak. The dragon emerged and listened; as it grew smaller by the moment, it leapt into his sleeve. He admonished it sternly, and the dragon surged back into the water. Soon after, rain fell from the sky.\n\nIn the third year of the Yuantong reign, he again withdrew to Wuyi Mountain, residing at the Zhizhi Hermitage of Ziqing. Li Taiping, the marshal of eastern Zhejiang, heard of him and paid him homage, saying, “When commands are strict, the lord governs; when the mind is clear, cares diminish.” Li was all the more filled with reverence and admiration.\n\nWhen the rebel Li Zhifu invaded Zhangzhou, the imperial court appointed Prefect Wu to oversee the campaign against the bandits and named him vanguard to pacify them. His son, Zhongliang, wished to take him as master, but he refused. Soon after, the rebels were indeed vanquished.\n\nAs the spirits of the multitude grew weary or sought audience in great numbers, they plotted to poison him. He foresaw this and commanded his disciples to dig a pit in the earth. The poison was indeed regurgitated, and the site is now called the Elixir-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month of the Zhiyuan reign, his fellow adept Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—sat in dissolution upon Mount Lu. Hearing of this, on the tenth day of the fourth month, he commanded his disciples to record his final words, then sat in meditation and passed away. Thirteen days later, his face remained as though in slumber, his limbs warm and supple as in life. His disciples interred him beneath an ancient plum tree beside the hermitage.\n\nHe was born on the fourth day of the fifth month in the bingzi year of the Zhiyuan reign. His foremost disciples—Lao Yansu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\nMang Miaozi remarked: The resolute men and righteous knights of old necessarily endured hardship and kept themselves pure to fulfill their aspirations. Thus they regarded the rending of flesh and the breaking of sinew as matters of course, and so their towering singularity endured, sufficient to serve as models for a thousand generations. Such was Jin Pengtou. Yet if one seeks to establish a name in the world, one must first attain such a state—how much more so for those who transcend illusion and transformation? To seek such ability and yet fail to achieve the Dao is unheard of. Alas, how few in each generation are capable of this!\n\n**Biography of Zhao Yuanyang**\n\nZhao Yuanyang, styled Yizhen, was a native of Anfu in Ji Prefecture. His ancestors hailed from Junyi; a certain thirteenth-generation descendant of Prince Dezhao of the Song’s Yan Kingdom served as magistrate of Anfu under the Yuan and settled there. Yuanyang was precocious in childhood, fond of reading, and skilled in recitation. He broadly mastered the classics, histories, and the hundred schools of thought, and in his youth pursued the path of the imperial examinations. Before long, he sat for the metropolitan examination but, due to illness, did not proceed. His condition lingered, and one night he dreamed of a divine being who said, “You are a man of my Dao—why do you aspire to worldly honor?” His father then directed him to follow the Dao, and thereafter he became deeply devoted to tranquility and simplicity. His learning advanced ever further.\n\nAt first, he studied under a man of the Dao in his prefecture, one Zeng Chenwai, and inherited the essential teachings. Wherever he found gaps in the texts, he would investigate and expound upon them in exhaustive detail. Later, he studied under Zhang Tianquan of Taiyu Abbey in Ji, also known as Iron Mystery Zhang, who had himself learned from Jin Yea of Mount Longhu and received the oral instructions for the inner and outer elixirs of golden fluid. Subsequently, he studied under Li Xuanyi of Nanchang, who recommended him to his own master, Master Feng of the Robe of Feathers. Master Feng had also studied under Yea.\n\nIt is said that he once traveled to Yongxing Abbey on White Crane Mountain, the former site of the immortal Kuang of the Western Jin, and took up residence there. When asked about the methods he had been taught for summoning thunder and rain or refining the essence-spirit, he demonstrated extraordinary efficacy, drawing seekers from over a thousand *li* to gather and follow him.\n\nIn the year *renchen*, when war broke out, he journeyed west with his disciples through Wu and Shu, and upon his return, traveled to Mount Wudang, paid homage at Mount Longhu, and visited the legacy sites of the Celestial Master of Han. At that time, Celestial Master Chongxu deeply admired and honored him, wishing to retain him, but he declined. Many of the abbey’s scholars then became his disciples.\n\nReturning to Ziyang Abbey in Yudu of Ganzhou, he took up residence there. He compiled all the profound principles of the Daoist canon into written works. At times, he composed poems and songs to admonish himself, and he also used medicine to aid others. In seclusion, he spoke little and laughed seldom, yet those who heard of him longed to pay him homage but could not.\n\nHis lofty conduct and noble integrity were admired by his contemporaries, and his followers grew ever more numerous. In the first month of the year *rentu*, on the first day of the new year, he addressed his assembly, saying, “I am about to depart. From this day forth, I shall seal the gate of stillness—take care that none disturb me.” By the third day of the fifth month, the summer solstice, he opened the gate, exhorted his disciples to stand firm in their own practice, rinsed his mouth, bathed, changed his robes, and sat in meditation.\n\nJust then, the county’s herald arrived with an imperial edict, playing music in celebration. Yuanyang immediately wrote a farewell message, cast aside his brush, and passed away. Thunder and lightning suddenly erupted, and daylight turned to darkness. The next day, officials and commoners who had come to pay their respects gathered in great numbers. His disciples, mourning deeply, requested that Master Deyuan and others prepare a coffin for the encoffining. His limbs remained supple as if alive. Once the rites were complete, sweat emerged, bathing his entire body.\n\nThree days later, behind the meditation platform on Phoenix Ridge,...\n\nAfter a long time, the grasses withered and birds no longer nested there. His disciples, such as Cao Xiwu and Liu Ruoyuan, still entered his chamber to receive instruction. Several of his poems and lyrics have circulated in the world; as for his profound and esoteric discourses, they are recorded in the *Essentials of the Dao*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe writings of the Mystic Gate number in the thousands, and the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship is fully expounded therein. As for the teachings on immortality and longevity, they emphasize nothing more than emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action—truly easy to understand and easy to practice. Thus, those who emerge in each generation to transcend the mundane must uphold austere conduct and lofty integrity. Without exceptional resolve and vision, none can attain such heights. How, then, could one dismiss them as mere delusions of the obscure?\n\nAs for Yuanyang, his words suffice to guide the world, and his Dao suffices to enlighten later generations. How could he not be commemorated? Yet what shines so brightly cannot be extinguished—what need is there for verification?\n\n---\n\n**Letter to Ni Mengchong on the Fire Times**\n\nRecently, you graced my mountain retreat with a visit, and your lofty discourse filled the day, cleansing my withered and rustic heart—how deeply comforting! I had hoped you might stay a while longer, that we might speak through the night amid mountain rains and savor the true flavor of forest and spring. Yet you departed like the wind, leaving me with a lingering sense of loss.\n\nLater, I received your refined composition, and after washing my mind and savoring its depths, I immersed myself in its meaning. Truly, there are moments when silent understanding and heartfelt resonance arise. Your learning is vast and profound—how could I, in my limited capacity, fully grasp or comprehend it? Yet I am precisely the sort who seeks to explore the subtle and delve into the hidden.\n\nRecently, I have suffered unforeseen calamities. Flattery and deceit have grown rampant, and hypocrisy and falsehood compete to arise. The perilous and treacherous circumstances of the time are like fire that burns and water that drowns—nowhere to escape. I have no choice but to endure in silence, feign ignorance, and take blame upon myself. What more is there to say?\n\nAt such times, I have yet to see a single person who remains steadfast and unchanging, upholding propriety and mutual support. Why is it that so many abandon principle and follow the vulgar tide? Even if there are those with talents like Feng Guan or Zhu Bo, they remain mute, watching in silence without uttering a word. For the sake of wetting one’s feet, would one not save a drowning man?\n\nFortunately, with your wisdom guiding me and the legacy of our ancestors’ blessings, I have survived and returned. Yet my illness lingers, and the ways of the world shift like thunder and surging rivers—how could such drastic changes occur? Truly, it is lamentable.\n\nThus, in the midst of adversity, I strive to reflect inwardly, restrain myself, and cultivate virtue with reverence, awaiting Heaven’s decree. This is how the ancients handled glory and disgrace, gain and loss—accepting whatever befell them. Though loved ones may grieve and detractors rejoice, none can sway my heart or shake my resolve. Precisely in times of hardship and peril does one test the strength of one’s progress on the Way.\n\nThus, King Wen was imprisoned and composed the *Book of Changes*; Confucius faced adversity and compiled the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Even among those who excelled in learning and literature—such as Ban, Ma, Yang, Jia, Han, Liu, Ou, and Su—none escaped exile or demotion. Yet their studies never ceased, and their virtue only deepened. As the saying goes, “Without encountering tangled roots, one cannot distinguish a sharp blade.” This is the truth. Did they seek to embellish their faults to deceive later generations?\n\nAs for myself, I have brought misfortune upon myself through caution, and by anticipating disaster, I have invited it. What else could this be if not fate and destiny? As the saying goes: “Cast a man to the jackals and tigers, and they will not eat him; cast him to the northern wastes, and they will not receive him; cast him to the vast heavens, and they will not accept him.” I have witnessed this firsthand—how could I not feel shame in my heart? Though I am humbled now, I may yet rise in the future.\n\nFortunately, I find temporary peace among streams and rocks, dwelling daily with trees and stones, wandering with woodcutters and herders. Little separates me from a rustic life, yet I am free to indulge my aspirations in discourses on nature, destiny, and the Dao. Compared to those mediocre souls who chase fleeting fame and profit—scheming and deceiving, jostling like flies and ants after carrion—what are their true intentions? Who among them understands the Way of advancing and retreating, living and perishing, following only what is right? They do not consider life and death, success and failure—why then do they scramble for favor and flattery?\n\nMoreover, the mandate one receives from Heaven is fixed. How could the whims of a single person alter it? This is something the world cannot comprehend—it is the common affliction of past and present.\n\nYet your words have deeply resonated with me, and I have much to learn from them. Though my studies fall short, I have lingering doubts—particularly regarding the transmission of the *fire times*. For decades, I have consulted with masters beyond the world, yet few have truly aligned with my understanding.\n\nSome speak of it in wild and absurd terms, dismissing it all as empty—claiming that the hexagrams, lines, and timekeeping are merely frameworks, to be followed but not rigidly adhered to. Others speak of it in profound and secretive terms, insisting on precise details—claiming that the signs, weights, and measures are its laws, to be upheld without deviation. Which of these is correct?\n\nAs for the mysteries of Qian and Kun, Kan and Li; the essence of metal and the sap of wood; the fire dragon and water tiger; the gold within water and the wood within fire; the marvels of reversal and return; the metaphors of the crucible, furnace, and elixir—I have heard them all. Yet I remain uncertain about the hundred days of foundation-laying, the ten-month gestation of the embryo, the mechanism of spiritual transformation after birth, and the precise application of the fire times. Specifically, the true yin and true yang of Kan and Li, their ascent and descent, their ceaseless circulation—this is the unity of the Five Phases and yin-yang, and yin-yang is the Supreme Ultimate.\n\nFrom the Supreme Ultimate arise the Four Images, and from the Four Images emerge the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams unfold into sixty-four hexagrams, and the sixty-four hexagrams further unfold into three hundred eighty-four lines—endlessly circulating, ceaselessly flowing. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are boundless, none can escape this pattern.\n\nThis is how a single breath in the human body harmonizes with the Dao of heaven and earth, and how humans may steal the mechanism of heaven and earth. Viewed thus, a year has twelve months, a month thirty days, and a day one hundred ke. A month totals three thousand ke, and ten months total thirty thousand ke—within these thirty thousand ke, one seizes the tally of heaven’s thirty thousand years. Each ke of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal nodes, so thirty thousand ke may seize thirty thousand years. Thus, a year’s twelve months comprise thirty-six thousand units, and within thirty thousand ke, each ke must be harmonized. Should even a single ke deviate, the medicinal ingredients dissipate, and the fire times falter. If the fire’s measure is excessive, it scorches; if the water’s weight is overabundant, it floods. The scorching of fire and the flooding of water must be balanced without fail.\n\nTherefore, drilling years into months, drilling days into hours, within the twelve hours, only one hour is pivotal. One must not be ignorant of the new moon, full moon, first and last quarters, the bathings of purification and punishment, the waxings and wanings, the advancements and retreats. There is a saying:\n\n*The Southern and Northern Schools invert the hexagrams’ images,\nDawn and dusk fire times align with the celestial pivot.\nFollow the day, follow the hour to weigh the measures—\nA hair’s deviation, and the elixir fails to form.\nFrom of old, the commands of geng and jia are made clear,\nExchanging days for hours refines the divine work.*\n\nThe recorded fire times confirm the sages’ adage: \"Transmit the medicine, not the fire.\" And again:\n\n*If the winter solstice does not fall at zi,\nThe great medicine is not measured in jin.\nTrue fire has no fixed time—\nComparing it to mao and you is futile.\nWithin this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images;\nTo exhaust the lines is to labor in vain.*\n\nThus, the signs and measures are not mere empty words. This must begin with effort and culminate in effortlessness.\n\nAs heaven and earth complete one cycle in a year, the sun, moon, and stars complete one cycle in a month, and the great medicine of the human body completes one cycle in a day and night. Within a single day, yang is born at zi, reaches its peak at si, while yin is born at wu and peaks at hai. Yang begins with *Fu* (Return), and yin begins with *Tai* (Peace). Within a month, the new moon begins with *Zhun* (Difficulty) and *Meng* (Youth), and the dark moon ends with *Ji Ji* (After Completion). From *Xun* to *Kun*, all are hexagrams of the unborn—thus, what comes is met with reversal. From *Zhen* to *Qian*, all are hexagrams of the already born—thus, what passes is followed in sequence.\n\nThe year’s twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal markers—this is what is meant by \"one return per month as one revolution, nine returns in a year as nine revolutions,\" which aligns precisely with the immortal masters’ teachings.\n\nMaster Zhu of Kao Ting, however, held that the method of fire times takes the three hundred eighty-four lines as the tally of one celestial cycle, with each line governing a day. Since there are more lines than days, the four trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—totaling twenty-four lines—are removed to correspond to the twenty-four fortnights. As each fortnight arrives, the fire is gradually increased. Yet within a single day, the tally already completes three hundred sixty units, while the fire added per fortnight amounts to only one line—its weight and measure are incommensurate.\n\nAccording to his method of calculation, the month is divided among twelve hexagrams, each governing two and a half days. Each hexagram’s lines are applied to its own tally. The tally’s quantity, whether greater or lesser, determines the vigor of the yang’s movement or the depth of the mind’s quiescence. Twelve hexagrams complete one month’s work, and twelve months complete one year’s cycle—repeating endlessly without excess or deficiency.\n\nIs this not how the marvels of the *Great Change* perfectly accord with the great elixir? Through this method of withdrawal and addition, advancement and retreat, there must arise the transformations of waxing and waning.\n\nHow could it compare to the one-sidedness of sinking into emptiness and stagnating in quiescence—what the Chan school calls the \"demon’s den beneath Black Mountain,\" for it is but silent sitting in the realm of yin? This diverges utterly from the essence of our Life-Dao school.\n\nOnly my friend, who has devoted a lifetime to exhaustive study and traversed lakes and seas, must have long grasped these subtle mysteries. I can but hope he will deign to enlighten me, that even in my twilight years, I might gain some small progress and await its fruition—how could I ever forget its source?\n\nThis is not a discourse to be shared with those long bound in mountain forests, clad in tattered robes and subsisting on coarse fare, severed from the world. Nor is it for those who flaunt themselves before the age or fawn for fame and profit. Yet one must also discern the unfit, lest words miss their mark—so may this not stray from true understanding.\n\nWith utmost reverence, I return the brush and bow, awaiting even a single feeble shot from your bow. How fortunate, how fortunate indeed!\n\n*Jianquan Collection*, Scroll Four concludes.\n[*Originally omitted the character \"柔,\" now restored according to context.*]\n\n*Jianquan Collection*, Scroll Five\nBy Qishan’s Non-Action Heavenly Master, Zhang Yuchu\n\n**Admonitions and Inscriptions**\n*Inscription for a Study, with Preface*\n\nIn my youth, before reaching adulthood, I developed a passion for learning and set my aspirations high. I memorized and recited all the words of the former Confucian scholars—every poem, book, and text of the Six Arts. As I grew older, I reflected that my grasp of the literary arts remained incomplete. Thus, in great cities and towns, wherever scholars of learning and conduct were renowned in their time as masters and elders, I sought their company. Thereupon, my reading expanded to encompass the classics, histories, and philosophical works, extending even to the writings of Laozi and the Buddha. The volumes piled up daily, yet only when I synthesized their essential teachings and turned inward to embody sincerity did I realize that all was already complete within me.\n\nOn the discourse of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny, from Confucius and Mencius downward, the teachings of Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai, Shao Yong, and Lü Zuqian stand as heirs. In the craft of literary composition—from Zuo Qiuming onward through Ban Gu, Sima Qian, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi—no later school surpasses antiquity. If one’s learning departs from the masters of the Zhou and Cheng traditions, it cannot be called true learning. If one’s writing strays from the models of Ban and Sima, it cannot be called true literature. Thus, I reject even finely wrought texts that fail to convey the Dao. The ancients spoke of learning as self-cultivation—how could it be divided into two paths? Pursuing this principle to its fullest, one draws near to the ancient classics and their commentaries. Those who do not probe the root and seek the source—how can their efforts be deemed learning? It is not merely the adornment of rhetoric or the pursuit of rank and emolument. The essence of self-mastery and sincere cultivation lies in aspiring to sagehood and worthiness.\n\nWhat is nurtured within must be cultivated without. In harmony, heaven and earth find their places, and the myriad things flourish. The profound suffices to embrace transformation and traverse the unseen, while the luminous suffices to refine ritual and music and assist in nurturing life. Is this not the way to guide rulers and benefit the people? Such is the great enterprise of ordering the fundamental principles of governance. Yet the path of transcending the world relies upon the words of Laozi, Guan Yin, Zhuangzi, and Liezi. How could it share a road with the harsh legalism of Shen Buhai and Han Fei or the reckless critiques of recluses? As for the singular conduct of the Buddha’s followers—illuminating the mind and perceiving nature—it too serves as an aid to transcending the world. But their heterodox doctrines and deviant practices cannot escape censure; how could one dismiss them all as mere emptiness and void?\n\nAs for later texts on divination, astrology, and omens, I have no leisure to examine them. I regret only that my dull and inferior nature is unequal to fully inheriting this aspiration. I have set aside a chamber to store these works and inscribed this admonition upon its walls as a warning to myself. May it also be passed to future generations to encourage their resolve—let them not neglect it.\n\n**Inscription:**\nSince the dawn of writing and the study of ancient canons,\nThe eternal principles follow their order—\nThe gateway of the Dao and virtue.\nWhen the Supreme Emperor bestowed the celestial endowment,\nThe August One established the ultimate norm.\nThe Mandate of Heaven flows and operates—\nOne must follow its pattern.\nIn purity, sincerity, and clarity,\nOne returns to the origin.\nWhen form is enslaved by things and altered by change,\nWho remains hidden in my emptiness?\n\nOnly the sages and worthies\nHave illuminated their plans and teachings.\nWith careful thought and steadfast practice,\nOne washes away dross and dissolves obstructions.\nEstablishing the body and enacting its use,\nIn movement and stillness, one maintains balance.\nCherishing the essence and savoring the bloom,\nOne manifests it in words.\nThe heart governs nature and emotion;\nA hundred thoughts unite as one.\nExpansive order, lofty chapters—\nThe great tone, the pure flavor.\nDispelling delusion and returning to truth,\nProbing the subtle and attaining the mysterious,\nMists and grime dissolve entirely,\nNever departing from Heaven.\n\nTo gather and dwell in discernment—\nWhat value lies in jade tablets and sashes?\nHold these words dear forever,\nAnd befriend the ancients across the ages.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for an Ancient Zither, with Preface**\n\nSu Kuai’s family possesses an ancient zither, said to have been crafted by Master Lei. Kuai is especially fond of the zither and once spoke of it to Mangmiaozi.\n\nKuai said: “Born late, I cannot fathom the realm of sages and worthies, nor do I harbor ambitions for fame and recognition. My refuge in the hills and forests lies solely in playing the music of high antiquity, responding to the wind in the pines and the springs among the rocks. How is this not a conversation with the people of Fuxi and Shennong’s time? Though I do not match Boya in skillful playing, in your keen listening, are you not the very Ziyou—he who recognized the high mountains and flowing waters? You should compose an inscription for me.”\n\n**Inscription:**\nIts substance moist and clear—\nTo express my song.\nIts form round and square—\nTo uphold my dignity.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for Reverent Silence, with Preface**\n\nMangzi wore a coarse hempen robe and a tattered fur coat, wandering atop Phoenix Terrace. A guest laughed and said to him: “You study the teachings of Master Zhuang—is your knowledge limited to the way of profound silence? Do you also know what we Confucians call ‘reverent silence’?”\n\nMangmiaozi stepped aside and addressed the guest: “Why do you fear this? Is it truly unwelcome, or merely superficial? Our king is virtuous and loves scholars. Since ascending the throne, no discourse on the Dao, virtue, benevolence, or righteousness has failed to enter his ears or reside in his heart. Thus, he pursues learning with tireless diligence and conducts himself with unwavering dedication. He has inscribed the words ‘reverent silence’ in the corner of his seat as a reminder to himself. Now that I have met you, Master Hou, how could I not offer a word to advance your understanding?”\n\nUnable to decline, I composed this and spoke:\n\nThe Dao in relation to things—\nThough heaven and earth are vast,\nAnd the myriad beings numerous,\nWith no distinction between past and present,\nOr day and night—\nIts subtlety and wonder,\nIts refinement and coarseness,\nIts waxing and waning, advance and retreat,\nIts transformations and changes—\nAll accord with the slightest movement of the heart.\nIt can match the utmost greatness of heaven and earth,\nThe utmost multitude of the ten thousand things.\nYin and yang, movement and stillness,\nFollow what has no beginning or end.\nThough the ten thousand differences swirl in confusion,\nThey are truly contained in a single root.\n\nGrasp its essentials firmly,\nAnd hold fast without lapse—\nThen there is no loss in presence or absence,\nAnd one merges with the reality of Heaven’s inherent principle.\nIf one grows lax in grasping,\nOr slack in holding fast,\nThe obscurations of human desire—\nHow swiftly they gallop like a runaway steed,\nCovering a thousand miles in an instant!\n\nYet the work of grasping and holding fast—\nIs it not precisely what we call ‘reverent silence’?\nReverence approaches ritual.\nSincere reverence perfects virtue;\nTranquil reverence preserves one’s position;\nConsummate reverence fulfills its measure.\nThus, ritual is perfected through reverence and only then is there peace.\n\nSilence approaches the Dao.\nGuard it with cautious silence,\nReflect on it with reverent silence,\nNurture it with profound silence—\nOnly then does one reach the ultimate work of the Dao.\nSuch is silent recognition, silent demeanor, silent resonance,\nAttained without effort.\n\nYet there must be a means to achieve its center,\nLest one err by excess or deficiency.\nThus, conduct does not exceed reverence,\nAnd silence does not fall short of concealment.\nIn reverence, one fulfills ritual’s unyielding demand;\nIn silence, the heart cannot but remain still.\nThen in movement and stillness, speech and silence,\nAll is governed by the One—\nNo external desire can disturb one’s center.\n\nIf one should fail in due reverence or lapse in proper silence,\nOne falls short of the subtlest depths.\nThus, reverence knows no rest,\nSilence knows no desire.\nWithout rest, there is unity;\nWithout desire, there is stillness.\nUnity suffices to govern multiplicity,\nStillness suffices to master motion.\nSuch is the way—\nEven the utmost in cultivating the heart and nurturing nature,\nIn preserving one’s Heaven-given endowment,\nDoes not exceed this.\n\nDoes one not wander in the primal vastness?\nHow does this differ from the thunder’s roar—\nOr the profound silence of the hidden?\n\nNow, when a worthy prince holds the altars of state,\nHe examines virtue and inquires into learning,\nDevout, reverent, cautious, and tranquil,\nDiligently taking the defense of the imperial house as his heart’s aim.\nIn his inquiries, there is a clear origin and sequence,\nExtending upward to the sagely brilliance on the throne,\nWith brotherly affection deepening ever more.\nHow splendid! How magnificent!\nI dare to inscribe this in verse.\n\n**Inscription:**\nOh, radiant Lord on High,\nBestowing the center here—\nAll noble qualities\nAre endowed with constant principle.\nHow outstanding the worthy prince,\nFirm in his self-mastery!\nUnified and preserved,\nHe dares not grow careless.\nIn solemnity and reverence,\nDaily he strives for clarity.\nReverent and silent,\nHow could he ever falter or stray?\n\nLofty his hall’s words,\nMajestic his virtuous teachings.\nNot drawn to extravagance,\nHe draws from what is noble and bright.\nHold fast without wavering,\nGrasp firmly to illumine—\nEver aiding the imperial screen,\nEver broadening virtue’s foundation.\nHis era attains its glory,\nThe imperial favor shines resplendent.\nMay his flourishing wings endure a thousand ages,\nHis great merit eternally radiant.\n\n**Admonition on Concealed Cultivation**\nThe heart’s square inch governs the primordial One,\nBy which it matches Heaven and Earth as one body,\nStands with the Three Powers as their equal.\nHow is this endowment possessed?\n\nIt must be said: Principle is its master,\nThe Ultimate is its depth.\nWithout principle, it cannot stand;\nWithout the Ultimate, it is not complete.\nWithout standing, nothing can be ordered within;\nWithout completion, nothing can harmonize with Heaven.\nConcealment dims its brilliance,\nCultivation disciplines its conduct—\nLest one be no more than a common man.\n\nWho strays from the empty and numinous?\nThus, stillness and unity firm its root,\nVigor and compliance deepen its source.\nFill it with benevolence and righteousness,\nEnrich it with eloquence.\nReturning to seek within,\nIn action, one bears the duty of benefiting the age;\nIn retreat, one guards one’s mystery.\nThis is called “withdrawing from the world without distress,”\n“Abiding in reverence and preserving the center.”\nWhat ancient scholar surpassed this?\nHow dare I rest in aspiring to worthiness?\n\nYet in exploring the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi,\nDelving into the words of the Zhou and Shao,\nI temper myself without bias.\nOnly in the steadfast practice of these words,\nMust I daily hold them fast.\n\n**Ancient Inkstone Inscription**\nSu Kuai in his youth loved books,\nAnd treasured an ancient inkstone—\nPurple in substance, white in veining.\nSome called it from Duān or Shè,\nPerhaps it was so.\nHe requested an inscription in stone,\nTo show future generations.\n\n**Inscription:**\nIts substance’s luster arises from stillness as virtue,\nIts veining’s purity arises from silence as constancy.\nIn its capacity alone,\nWriting knows no end.\n\n**Inscription for the Nurturing Nature Studio**\nEmpty and numinous, profoundly clear,\nA deep pool mirroring all.\nThe slightest speck mars its purity,\nAs a raging torrent soils a mirror.\nThe autumn sky embraces the void,\nThe cold river’s moon gleams.\nWho wields the dark mechanism?\nOnly in stillness is there steadiness.\n\n**Inscription for the Retiring and Resting Studio**\nThe ten thousand things share one source,\nThe profound principle is utterly luminous.\nHold fast with sincerity,\nRectify the root and master the self.\nWhen turbidity, delusion, and falsehood arise,\nThoughts and cares swirl in confusion.\nIn movement and stillness, cultivate together,\nReturn to reverent stillness.\nGo forth, scholars!\nAwaken to the sagely words.\nTurn toward dusk to rest—\nOnly in benevolence is one’s true nature.\n\nSolemnly dwell in the vast abode,\nCarefully seek one’s path.\nLet no month pass without vigilance.\n\n**Eulogy for the Perfected Moon Cauldron**\nHis heart roams in the Great Beginning,\nHis traces transcend the empty vastness.\nWhen extended, he fills the six voids;\nWhen gathered, he does not fill a fist.\nNow feigning madness in the mortal realm,\nNow discoursing idly on the dregs—\nThese are but incidental matters.\nA drop may harbor the numinous,\nAs thunder’s charge stuns the rivers.\nWho has glimpsed his body beyond the body?\nHow could one capture his likeness?\n\n**Eulogy for the Gourd and Bamboo Hat Image**\nBorn of an illustrious lineage,\nIn youth he hastened to the gate of learning,\nIn maturity he cherished histories and classics.\nIf one calls him eminent—\nWhen did he ever cast off his cap and sash?\nIf one calls him reclusive—\nHe has indeed rested his head on flowing streams and rinsed with stones.\nWas this not unshaken by poverty or success?\nIndeed so.\n\nOnly in his detachment from worldly affairs,\nHe stands solemn as a lone crane’s cry in clear frost,\nSerene as a deep pool’s cold azure.\nWho would deem this the abode of his vast learning?\nOr rather, does he lodge his lofty purity,\nContent with gourd and bamboo hat for his ease?\n\n**Eulogy for the Confucius Inquiring into Ritual Illustration**\nConfucius and Laozi took different paths,\nYet the Dao shares a single source.\nRitual is what we practice,\nHolding reverence and preserving unity.\nHeaven and Earth’s warp and weft,\nThe canons of Shang and Zhou—\nThe great sound is soundless,\nThe rest is silence.\n\n**Eulogy for Boyi and Shuqi**\nThe Shang declined, the Zhou rose,\nThe mandate shifted with the tripods’ passing.\nThe Dao resides in constant principle,\nSteadfast in benevolence and righteousness.\nWhat endures? What perishes?\nWho discerns? Who obstructs?\nGathering ferns in their seclusion,\nTheir lofty wind endures through the ages.\n\n**Eulogy for the Perfected Lord Wang Chongyang**\nThe Dao flourished at its origin,\nThe mandate shifted with the fall of metal.\nAt Louguan and Zhongnan,\nThe lotus fragrance spread through the lineage.\nA dragon’s bearing in his youth,\nA tempest’s might in his prime,\nVastly he roamed the heavens,\nHis immortal aura gracing generations.\n\n**Eulogy for Perfected Lord Le Zhen of Tang**\nHis spirit roamed the mysterious workings,\nHis radiance illuminated the true lineage.\nBeyond form yet conforming to the image,\nWithin the compass of the celestial pattern.\nWith wondrous mastery of wind and thunder,\nHis heart beheld the imperial norm.\nThe imperial favor blazed resplendent,\nProfound and silent, deep as the abyss.\n\n**Eulogy for Perfected Lord Xi Yi**\nWhite clouds of Mount Hua,\nWandering as his will inclined.\nHe cast off fleeting glory,\nSilently guarding the mysterious ultimate.\nThe perfected one dreams no dreams,\nFor he treads the path of true repose.\nGuiding his chariot through the void,\nHis form abides in the Great Simplicity.\n\n**Eulogy for Perfected Lord Shi Chen Wang**\nEndowed with a spirit of divine essence,\nHis Dao harmonized with the true transmission.\nEncompassing sun and rain,\nHe transcended images before their arising.\nHis radiance aided the imperial designs,\nA confluence of profound grace.\nLike a leaf borne on the wind, his legacy\nAwakens us from ignorance.\n\n**Eulogy for Perfected Lord Huang of Lei Yuan**\nOf vast and capacious nature,\nPure and luminous in his majesty,\nHe blended the myriad differences,\nComprehending all without bound.\nThe mysterious canon and supreme Dao,\nThe subtle patterns of esoteric words—\nSurveying past and present,\nHe beheld the One Origin.\n\n**Eulogy for Perfected Lord Yan Su Lao**\nA vessel of rivers and seas,\nLeaping like mountains and marshes,\nHe manifested wondrous function,\nUnfathomable in being and nonbeing.\nAutumn skies and forest whispers,\nStone chambers and scrolls of mystery—\nHis penetrating gaze spanned the distant,\nAs wind and thunder rolled and unfurled.\n\n**Eulogy for Master Zhou Zhenbai**\nLo! In the august Yuan,\nHis prominence reached its zenith.\nThe bearing of virtue and righteousness,\nThe command of benevolence and purity.\nGreat was his ancestral line,\nHis illustrious culture enduring.\nStill as a tranquil lake,\nKeen as ice and snow.\n\n**Eulogy for Master Su of Yingyan**\nA countenance of clouds and sun,\nA majesty of orchids and irises,\nA loyal heart spilling ten thousand words,\nLiterary brilliance spanning a hundred generations.\nGreen peaks of Meishan against the sky,\nThe Ying River stretching to the horizon—\nA thousand years of his legacy,\nSolemn and resplendent in its clarity.\n\n**Eulogy for the Feathered Robe of Qishan**\nFeathered robe of mountains and forests,\nPure elegance of rivers and seas,\nHis conduct keen as ice and snow,\nHis heart warm as spring’s sun.\nSoaring cranes and a lone skiff,\nWild geese and a plain zither—\nNo image could capture him,\nFor his was the vast, soundless tone.\n\n**Inscription for the Nine Radiance Elixir Chamber**\nThe Marquis of Jingkou, Lord Mian, studied the Dao on Horse Hoof Mountain. Legend holds that the Most High once descended there, leaving behind a horse’s hoofprint before ascending—one of the blessed lands. Of steadfast and sincere nature, he was devoted to the arts of Qi and Huang, transcribing texts to seek longevity.\n\nIn the early Hongwu era, after years of service as a selected attendant at the Bamboo Palace, his methods and arts became renowned in his time. He named his dwelling the *Nine Radiance Elixir Chamber*. Having sent a letter from the Yellow Bamboo Mountain, he sought an inscription from me.\n\nThe inscription reads:\n\nThe cosmos serves as the pivot, opening the empty chamber;\nThe grand vault radiates light, pouring forth golden liquid.\nThe divine elixir’s nine rays manifest without form,\nFire dragons soar as water tigers flee.\nKan and Li unite their essence, congealing the Great One—\nThere stands the man in towering cap, jade pendants chiming.\nSacred scriptures cast their glow, outshining sun and stars;\nWind-borne and cloud-chased, he outstrips plow and steed.\n\n*End of Volume Five of the Jianquan Collection*\n*Volume Six of the Jianquan Collection*\n*Composed by Zhang Yuchu, the Non-Action Celestial Master of Qishan*\n\n**Preface to the Green Petition for the Ji-Si Year’s Offering and Vigil**\nWe prostrate ourselves, for as heaven’s mandate draws near the court, we aspire to repay the nation’s grace; as the teaching’s lineage bears its burden, we rely on the emperor’s vast creation. Moreover, in presenting our concerns to forestall calamity, we dread the unforeseen changes that misfortune may bring—thus we duly prepare this vigil and prayer, trusting in its power to preserve wholeness. With pure sincerity in our offerings of water-plants, we invoke the boundless blessings of the sacred and true. Humbly we submit our inner trepidation, that our red hearts may be secretly perceived.\n\nWe pray that your wisdom and insight shine brightly, that your august compassion be vast and all-embracing. May past transgressions be absolved, all transformed by your molding grace; may peace and prosperity gather from this day forth, all nurtured by your encompassing care. May our earnest words ascend to move the divine, and may the numinous power unfold in secret. May the lineage of the teaching flourish, harmonizing with spring’s warmth to grow ever more abundant; may the imperial realm be blessed with fortune, turning the seasons to timely harmony.\n\n**Green Petition for the Ancestral Offering by the Zhang Clan**\nFrom heaven we receive our nature, and in our hearts we pray to the mysterious vault; from our father we receive our bodies, and how dare we forget the hidden and distant grace? With reverent sincerity we beseech the mandate, trembling as we confess our faults.\n\nWe recall our late father, who was born in an age of flourishing poetry but passed amid family hardship. Bereft of parental guidance, he early suffered the sorrow of loss; treading through brambles and thorns, he barely fulfilled the trust of the garden’s legacy. His birthday drew near, yet the day of his departure came first. The grief of failing to serve him in his final years lingers, and my younger brother’s drowning deepens the sorrow. Though we longed to present our plea through this offering, we were repeatedly hindered by worldly entanglements. Now we undertake this rite of advancement, that he may attain liberation and enlightenment.\n\nWe pray that the red writ may absolve his sins, that the green register may extend mercy. May his innate nature shine clearly, washing away all boundless depths of stagnation; may the light of the Yellow Springs illuminate widely, universally aiding those lost in past delusions. May all sentient beings equally achieve deliverance.\n\n**Green Petition for the Early Morning Offering**\nThe Qian Dao governs heaven, presiding over the norms of the mortal world; the imperial center establishes the pole, opening the ladder of supplication through the mysterious rites. Holding fast to the ancient covenant, we present our sentiments in gratitude.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, inherited the lineage before coming of age, and the burden of office has been profoundly difficult. Though disasters have not repeatedly boiled over, the near loss of heirs has occurred several times. Our resolve has truly faltered in cultivation, and we rely on prayer and exorcism for personal deliverance. Time has passed in delay, and we have circled the jeweled altar ten thousand times; yet your boundless grace has responded to our single sincerity. As we look up to your lofty and profound kindness, we especially hope for your transformative power.\n\nThe morning rites are solemnly observed, and our vows are fulfilled. We pray that your forgiveness be without limit, that your compassion abide in the immortal courts. May you soon bestow a brilliant heir like the spring sun, and may the mysterious teaching’s splendor grow daily, matching the radiance of the celestial luminaries. May vast blessings be bestowed, and great favor universally bestowed.\n\n**Regular Green Petition for the Offering**\nAs heaven and earth cover and bear all, the time swiftly arrives at the birthday; the ritual standards shine forth, and the fast is duly performed to fulfill our long-held vow. Looking up to the numinous, we reverently offer our thanks.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the office for years, yet our self-examination reveals no merit. Driven by anxiety, we have not been fortunate enough to see the restoration of peace; in serving the ancestral peach, we feel keenly the failure to fully succeed. Our morning and evening worries are deeply felt, and our efforts at introspection and renewal are earnest. We have prepared this offering and vigil with utmost sincerity, pouring out our heartfelt devotion before your imperial gaze.\n\nWe pray that the imperial way stand firm as a tripod, that the teaching’s lineage be treasured and upheld. May days bring longevity and health, extending the spring radiance of the mother’s hall; may family and household prosper, opening the orchid chamber to the long light of day. May these blessings extend to the immortal foundation, and may your profound grace descend upon all beings. May age and youth alike thrive in peace.\n\n**Green Petition for the Completion of the Main Palace’s Grand Hall**\nAs the *Yi* reveals the great strength that gives rise to palaces and halls, and the Dao shines with double brilliance as the temple’s construction is completed, we look up in reliance on your encompassing creation and reverently express our gratitude.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the office for years, yet our self-examination reveals no contribution. We have received the emperor’s profound favor, fortunate to be honored with responsibility; through the collective sincerity of all, we have relied on the gathering of gold. The passage of time has been long, and the work of axes and adzes has been arduous. Now that the beams and rafters stand complete, we empty our hearts in this offering and vigil.\n\nWe pray that the imperial realm be as vast as heaven, that the teaching’s standards shine like spring’s radiance. May the people prosper, bringing blessings of longevity and health to all; may tranquility and purity prevail, securing the foundation of this mountain’s peace. May these blessings extend to the lineage’s transmission, and may your profound grace abide in the tripod’s stability. May the hundred spirits guard and protect, and may the five fortunes be universally shared.\n\n**Green Petition for the Purple Tenuity Terrace**\nAs the North Star gathers the celestial bodies, governing the generation and nurturing of heaven and earth, and the Central Heaven administers the world’s balance, we reverently invoke the true rites and respectfully present our heartfelt offering.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have unworthily inherited the lineage and look up to the grace of your edicts. Traveling a thousand *li* to attend court, we have fortunately encountered the succession of the state’s altars; with wholehearted devotion to the imperial sacrifice, we have received the command to offer prayers for our ancestors. The hardships of the journey and the toil of travel have been many, and the delays of the star’s movement have caused concern. Yet our sincere prayers at the jeweled altar have fortunately aligned with the completion of the golden register. Thus we humbly present our repentant devotion and express our gratitude.\n\nWe pray that the Purple Tenuity shine brightly, secretly turning the radiance of auspicious stars; that the Yellow Path open clearly, abundantly extending the blessings of long life. May the teaching’s model grow ever more illustrious, and may the ancestral line thrive in peace.\n\n**Green Petition for the Early Morning Vigil at the Repentance Terrace**\nAs the August Emperor of Heaven governs the mechanisms of creation, and as we revere the vastness of the azure sky, we dread the unfathomable nature of calamity and have earnestly prayed in advance to avert it. The rites and proclamations are complete, and we base our repentance and thanks on sincerity.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the lineage for years, yet our path has been fraught with difficulties. Reflecting on the depth of our transgressions, we have seen repeated sorrows and anxieties.\n\nMay the radiant oversight shine forth, as we humbly present our confession of faults in prayer; may the descending gaze remain unceasing, fulfilling the rite of morning audience at the Primordial Altar. With earnest devotion, we submit this green petition in gratitude to the Mysterious Heavens.\n\nWe pray that the August Ultimate may shine resplendent, and the Emperor’s heart take note. May the model of the teaching grow luminous and the household way prosper; may longevity and peace abound. May the verdant chambers of the maternal abode flourish ever green, and the departed harmonize in peach-blossom felicity. May transgressions dissolve like melting ice, and blessings flow like spring’s warmth.\n\n**Green Petition for the Completion of the Universal Salvation Offering on Jia-Shen Day**\nWe recall that the August Emperor establishes the Ultimate, having graciously served through three reigns; yet the Celestial Lord bestows his favor, and we shamefully remain unrefined in even a single virtue. Grounded in sincerity, we offer gratitude and confess our faults.\n\nWe, your servant, have early inherited the immortal lineage and repeatedly encountered flourishing fortune. Yet our transgressions accumulate like mountains, bringing forth the hardships of calamity and adversity; our afflictions deepen daily, making it difficult to preserve the harmony of our household. Our prayers of supplication have been twice prostrated, and the joy of peace has been twice reborn. May the talismanic decree align with the era of *Guanju*’s harmonious beginning, fulfilling the hope of bearing the peach of filial succession. With reverence, we repay our plain vows and extend deliverance to our forebears. Thus, we purify the offerings of fern and delicacies, presenting them to seek the scrutiny of the numinous mirror.\n\nWe pray that the Emperor’s oversight may shine forth, and Heaven’s hearing be most clear. May names be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets, turning inauspicious stars into auspicious omens; may jade talismans convey life, raising the sunken and stagnant from the depths of the unseen. May the model of the teaching be secure and prosperous, and the ancestral line rest in tranquility.\n\n**Prayer Intention for the Ji-Si Offering**\nFortunate is the foundation of past blessings, having early inherited the rank of ancestral transmission; we bear the grace of the state and annually approach the sacred birthday of the Emperor. Yet we dread the great difficulty of audience and the perilous journey through wind and waves. Looking up, we beseech the offering and prayer, having already been bathed in the Mysterious Grace.\n\nYesterday, we petitioned for the removal of external burdens, relying truly on the protection of ultimate fulfillment. Suddenly afflicted by unexpected disturbances, we swiftly returned to safety. We have repeatedly prostrated in repentance and supplication, and together expressed gratitude for the support of creation.\n\nWe pray that the Emperor’s presence may reign above, and the numinous descent be most solemn. May he perceive the sincerity of human desires and forgive the accumulated stains of our transgressions. May the imperial realm flourish like a tripod, daily increasing the radiance of the teaching’s lineage; may the household’s blessings flow like spring, harmonizing with the revival of the ancestral way. May the gates and courtyards endure everlastingly, and peace and trust be universally upheld.\n\n**Annual Prayer Intention of This Prefecture**\nAs the years complete their cycle, we have fortunately enjoyed peace through the four seasons; bearing the axis of the teaching, we strive to repay it with wholehearted sincerity. Moreover, though our faults and regrets have amassed, our vigilance and effort in cultivation have often been lacking. Whether disasters arise from earth and wood or afflictions from human affairs and illness, we have repeatedly presented our prostrations and supplications, and time and again been blessed with preservation.\n\nThus, we dutifully follow the custom of the year-end farewell and respectfully offer our bundles of gratitude. We, your servant, equally rely on the ancestral grace and look up to the favor of the state. We lack the warmth and care of morning and evening, mindful of the toils endured through cold and heat. Without the aid of repentance and release, how could we achieve the averting of faults?\n\nWe pray that our earnest sincerity may ascend, and health and peace be bestowed. May the sacred realm flourish like spring, and the perfect transformation of the teaching be exalted; may the foundation of blessings open in prosperity, and auspicious signs harmonize with the household. May all hoped-for blessings to come be granted by the great benevolence of creation. May longevity flourish like the mother’s orchid, and honor equal the twin blossoms of the hall.\n\n**Prayer Intention for the Offering at the Round Terrace**\nIn the twenty-fifth year of Hongwu, incense was presented at Huagai Mountain. The Emperor’s command graciously descended to seek blessings for the Crown Prince; this humble servant, afflicted by illness, relied on his compassionate mother to pray for peace.\n\nMoreover, my office is not one gained through deceit or usurpation, yet I harbor deep concerns about the perils of distant travel. I must examine myself with reverent fear, and seek divine favor through prayer and ritual. May the gods silently assist, and the covenant of this offering be fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly pray that Heaven bestow its boundless grace, and the stars shine with radiant splendor. May the blessings of our household grow ever more vast, and benevolence and longevity ascend together; may the foundation of the realm harmonize with enduring peace, and sagely plans expand without limit. May the mother’s orchid flourish in longevity, and the twin blossoms of the hall exude the fragrance of orchids.\n\n**Intention for the Establishment of the Universal Salvation Offering**\nI reflect that I early inherited the immortal lineage and have repeatedly received the Emperor’s favor. The merits of my ancestors weigh upon me, for I have failed to repay them as my original vow demanded; my words and deeds bear faults and transgressions, and I lament that not even a shred of goodness has been achieved. All is subject to impermanence, and the rise and fall of fortunes remain unfathomable. In addition to fulfilling my earnest prayers, I am ever mindful of the weight of my duties. I rely on this offering for deliverance, that all my transgressions may be absolved.\n\nTruly, the great virtue delights in giving life, and responds with goodness though no words are spoken. We humbly pray that the Supreme One extend compassion from the northern pole, and the southern fire refine and temper. May the jade tally and golden writ swiftly open the clarity of the five portals; may the cinnabar realm and vermilion mound illuminate the nine depths like a torch. May grace extend to all creation, and blessings flow without end.\n\n**Early Morning Prayer for Universal Salvation**\nHeaven is high and Earth profound—how could one forget the grace of virtue? Days pass and months come, as swiftly as the exchange of past and present. I lay bare my sincerity and present my plea, exhausting my heart in this petition.\n\nI reflect that I, though inheriting noble rank, am filled with shame when I examine myself and repent my faults. The debt of gratitude I owe, whether near or far, deepens my sorrow; the hope of deliverance for the departed in the unseen realm urges me to offer thanks without delay. Fearing that my transgressions remain unatoned, I must seek purification through repentance to dissolve them entirely. Thus, I purify this morning offering and fulfill my simple vows.\n\nWe humbly pray that the nine depths release the bound from their sins, and the five sufferings cease their bitterness. May the root of life be preserved, and all attain the fruit of carefree wandering; may they ascend to the realm of true joy, and restore the springtime of growth and renewal. May the radiance of the teaching spread, and the imperial favor bring auspicious harmony.\n\n**Intention for the Universal Salvation Offering in the Jia-Shen Year**\nI reflect that I have unworthily inherited the immortal lineage and enjoyed the favor of the sagely court. Yet my sins run deep, and I have failed to cleanse my faults. My prolonged illness has brought distress to my household, leaving no peace. I knock at the gates of sincerity, hoping the myriad spirits will respond. Humbly presenting this modest offering, I seek to repay the imperial grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the sagely creation shine forth, and the Emperor’s heart hold us in favor. May past transgressions be dissolved, and misfortune swiftly give way to prosperity; may the dark realms be illuminated, and compassionate deliverance bring enlightenment. May the teaching’s influence be strengthened, and the household’s blessings flourish. May all within the realm of cultivation receive life and growth.\n\n**Sincere Intention for the Establishment of the Offering at the Round Terrace**\nThe sun rises and the moon sets, bound by the mechanisms of time. Yin waxes as yang wanes, and I fear that misfortune will leave no peace. I look upward, hoping to reverse the course of adversity, and earnestly beseech the vast Heaven with my prayers. Though the rites have been delayed for four years, a single sincere offering may yet reach the divine. I repay my vows, though overdue, and await the fulfillment of grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the imperial gaze shine brightly, and the Emperor’s benevolence spread boundlessly. May the teaching’s lineage endure like the mountains, and the five fortunes be fully bestowed; may the ancestral influence flourish like the rose, and a hundred auspicious signs gather. May disasters dissolve like melting ice, and joyous blessings converge in warmth.\n\n**Address for the Raising of the Beam in the Three Clarities Hall**\nWe humbly observe that the Three Realms and the divine continents manifest in the formless above; the Five Sacred Peaks and blessed lands open upon the renowned mountains of the Dragon and Tiger. Though the world has shifted through the dust of kalpas, we now behold the resplendent renewal of this hall. The Emperor’s grace knows no bounds, and the Dao’s transformation is without limit.\n\nWe revere His Majesty the Emperor, whose greatness equals Heaven and Earth, and whose brilliance rivals the sun and moon. His governance establishes order across the ten thousand regions, and his cultural unity extends to the four seas. His magnificent achievements and virtuous power form the foundation of royal governance; his sagely descendants will further expand the eternal imperial plan. The Daoist gate holds him in highest esteem, and this splendid edifice is newly constructed.\n\nWe look up to the Three Clarities and Three Realms Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Perfect of the Formless, the Primordial Lord. You preside as the original honored one of the three realms and govern the myriad heavens. From the mysterious origin, the beginning and completion took form; the pure and luminous coalesced, boundless and eternal. The purple writs and cinnabar texts expound the inner scriptures of the ten poles and nine skies; the golden codes and jade laws unfold the sacred chapters of the seven classics and eight wefts. Thus, the dragon scripts and phoenix seals are revealed, and the tiger guards and simurgh glues convene. The distant gaze turns to the palaces of cowrie and jade, and the towering view encompasses the terraces of elixir and herbs. This hall was completed in no time, and its grandeur is unmatched.\n\nFurthermore, we honor the immortal officials of the Divine Music Abbey, the abbot and supervisor, whose immortal bearing is like the lotus pavilion, and whose demeanor is that of mist and rosy clouds. They tread the azure gates of the purple palace, and lead the grand music of the cloud gates. Their noble efforts in planning have made them the pillars of the mountains and forests.\n\nWe also honor the director of the Daoist Registry, the left master of the Dharma, whose refined scholarship governs the pivotal mechanisms of the Dao; whose breath commands wind and rain, and who holds the secret levers of power. Day by day, they receive abundant imperial favor, and devote their utmost to planning and effort.\n\nMoreover, we honor the mountain-abiding supervisor, Master Li, whose jade carriage enhances the mountain’s splendor, and whose pearl-like virtue enriches the abyss. He explores the mysterious codes of the Dharma sea and assists the teaching’s seat in the pure capital. Together with the assembly of talented administrators and the many gentlemen who contributed gold, their fine reputations and noble aspirations have long shone in this enlightened age; their fragrant praise and virtuous renown resound together in the light of transformation.\n\nThis is the establishment of the teaching through the divine way, where wind and thunder shape its form. Now, the painted pillars and carved eaves gleam in the sky, dazzling the sun. How magnificent are the colorful columns and ornate doors, enveloped in mist and swirling wind! They unite the luminous clarity of the Azure Beginning and merge the true emptiness of the Great Red. The wondrous peaks and sacred ridges resemble the majestic postures of soaring dragons and phoenixes; the layered wheels and towering banners evoke the grandeur of clouds and mist. Fittingly, the myriad spirits gather in homage, and this is indeed a grand design for a thousand generations.\n\nThus, we raise the beam and respectfully offer this auspicious ode:\n\n**East of the Beam**\nFive clouds and auspicious mists swirl in the air,\nThe sun’s radiance illuminates the golden and silver palaces,\nMountains and peaks shine together in eternal glory.\n\n**South of the Beam**\nA thousand peaks and ten thousand ridges pile like indigo,\nRainbow banners and feathered standards...\n\nFloating in the void below, a millet-grain hangs high as the northern face aligns with the Dipper.\n\n**West of the Beam**\nJade groves and jasper grasses rise level with white clouds,\nSacred peaks array themselves in ordered ranks—\nGreen City stands revealed, its ten-thousand-kalpa cinnabar radiance linking to the Great Subtlety.\n\n**North of the Beam**\nElephant Ridge rounds high in a single hue with heaven,\nThe Han Altar’s jade plan and myriad spirits’ reverence—\nFortune marks the imperial decree as all nations pay homage.\n\n**Above the Beam**\nMist-borne chariots and rosy clouds, phoenix and crane in solemn array,\nJade Capital’s ethereal vastness, the Great Clarity’s domain—\nThe gods’ mysterious precincts are not without form.\n\n**Below the Beam**\nCavernous scriptures and divine canons follow wondrous transformation,\nUpon the Void Sovereign’s altar, moonlight shines bright—\nThe Four Numinous Ones surround the true immortal’s carriage.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the beam is raised, the imperial realm will grow ever vaster, and the mysterious teaching will shine with greater splendor. May the four quarters and eight wilds all be bathed in its nurturing grace; may the multitudes of people and all clans partake of its pure and tranquil winds. May the Dao’s domain know no bounds, and the lineage of immortals endure forever.\n\n**Raising the Beam for the Founding Master’s Hall**\n\nWe reflect that when the blazing Han’s teaching flourished, Dragon-Tiger became the abode of divine immortals. Lord Liu’s lineage, marked by jade and scepter, became the model of noble heritage. Long has the celestial palace been revered; how could it resist the turning of kalpas’ dust? Human plans endure, and imperial power renews.\n\nWith reverence, we consider His Imperial Majesty, who opened the Nine-Five diagram and established the primal orthodoxy. With vast vision and towering wisdom, he set the imperial standard to build the center; with abundant virtue and great merit, he governed the celestial offices and bestowed the calendar. The grand foundations of Tang and Wu flourish anew; the flourishing achievements of Han and Tang are now extended. He cherishes the courtly traditions since Yu’s tribute and gathers the harmonies of Shun’s music to institute rites. As heir apparent, he fulfills the people’s hopes for a true and good ruler; as imperial prince, he secures the state and altars’ peace. Rightly do Hua and Yi alike rejoice in harmony, while the Dao’s domain receives exceptional favor. Plans and strategies expand daily, and the pillars of heaven stand revealed.\n\nWe reverently consider the Founding Master, the Orthodox Unity, Profound and Mysterious, Tranquil and Responsive, Manifest and Protective True Lord—whose Dao is revered in the mysterious court, whose teaching unfolds in the Pure Capital. With divine might like wind and thunder, he truly crowns the three mountains’ eminence; with cap, sash, sword, and pendants, he manifests the source and flow of an illustrious lineage. He accumulates blessings for the state and people, nurturing fragrance in descendants. Through the earthworm’s humble service, he receives the celestial court’s favor, suddenly magnifying the divine edifice’s majestic gaze. A thousand years’ grand design is now a single moment’s magnificent sight.\n\nMoreover, we consider the worthy generals and ministers, the talented men of Min’s walls, and the great virtues of the four directions—all sharing an era’s glorious radiance. The Dao resides here, and the utmost spirit knows no bounds. The six directions follow heaven’s warp and earth’s weft; the five cities’ walls are attended by sun and clouds. Once, dragon-officials were driven to transport magnificent timber; soon, crane-borne decrees sought azure tiles. Wondrous wood was completed in the moon’s palace; southern gold arrived at the cloudy court. The Purple Capital’s twelve heavens transformed into Peng’s gates; the Jasper Capital’s thirty thousand households were moved from Fang and Ying. Truly, it resembles a conch-shell palace and cinnabar terrace, vast as the medicine steps and jasper halls. The isles of Feng and Lin, spring-warmed, revolve; the banners of phoenix and crane, their music resounding, descend from the Nine Clarities. Rainbow ranks and mist-borne carriages gleam like lightning, brushing the heavens. Without mountains and rivers’ majesty, how could the master and minister’s dignity be displayed? By the land’s elevated brightness, it fittingly crowns the admiration of humans and heavens. Thus, numinous spirits guard and escort, wind and thunder ever accompany the immortal capital; while pearls and jades shine brilliantly, the starry Han ascends to the imperial abode. Jade missives and gemmed scrolls—only Ge’s might compare; jade lotuses and golden stalks—perhaps Mao’s mound could rival. As we receive the forty-third transmission and rebuild for the fifteen-hundredth generation, though divine work is trustworthy, it is also the land’s numinous power that brings this to pass. Seizing the moment, it is completed in no time. With reverence for the six wefts, the twin beams are raised.\n\n**East of the Beam**\nLight divides the luminous peaks, the Dao like a dragon—\nSpring returns to the calendar, the morning mound’s beauty,\nAll within the nurturing harmony of the long-lasting wind.\n\n**West of the Beam**\nThe immortal terrace’s peaks rise level with clouds,\nJasper pools and jade trees stand beyond mist and rosy glow—\nAt times, celestial script descends in purple clay.\n\n**South of the Beam**\nDust Lake soars high, rivaling Hua’s balance,\nCloud banners and mist standards array in emerald ranks—\nThe sun guards the White Jade Casket of eternal life.\n\n**North of the Beam**\nThe Dao’s ancestor soars beyond all reckoning,\nIn crimson robes and fish-scale armor, solemn in layered heavens—\nSince ancient times, the Han’s house has been the immortals’ abode.\n\n**Above the Beam**\nThe ranked emperors dwell in a thousand-fathom vastness,\nNuminous lords pay timely homage, roaming the Great Clarity—\nThe Jade Treasury’s pivotal mechanisms are passed down through generations.\n\n**Below the Beam**\nTigers guard, dragons soar, phoenix carriages array,\nJade script shines bright amid the five clouds—\nFor kalpas without end, emptiness knows no day or night.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the beam is raised, the sagely lifespan will be as long as heaven, the imperial realm will flourish like a tripod, the heir’s glory will be magnified, and the world’s peace will be secured. May meritorious names rival Xiao and Cao’s; may household legacies emulate Yang and Guo’s. May the maple’s reach extend across rivers and seas, the mysterious wind flourish upon grand foundations; may virtue shine like coral and jade, the teaching’s lineage grow ever more prosperous in the imperial vessel. May the ancestral altar endure forever, and the Dao’s transformation know no bounds.\n\n**Raising the Beam for the Three Gates**\n\nWe reflect that Dragon-Tiger’s famed mountain marks the blessed land of pure emptiness; Feng and Lin’s separate isles open the vast gate of the Dharma. After yesterday’s flames of separation, today’s reconstruction begins anew. The Dao’s model is made manifest, and divine transformation is made clear. We look up to the three realms’ exalted ones and the ten directions’ assembled sages. The Founding Master, the Orthodox Unity, Profound and Mysterious, Tranquil and Responsive, Manifest and Protective True Lord—who initiated the Orthodox Unity’s ancestral wind and unfolded the Mysterious Origin’s wondrous transformation. Possessing the strategic advantage of mountains standing and rivers flowing, he expanded the celestial warp and terrestrial weft’s guiding principles. Precious scriptures and jade texts extended the fifteen-hundred-year immortal lineage; pearl palaces and jade towers honored the twenty-four administrations’ divine merit. The gate channels the sun and moon’s passage; the door mirrors heaven and earth’s opening and closing. Its beauty is splendid, its majesty imposing.\n\nMoreover, we consider the divine music’s immortal officials and the abbot’s guiding presence. Returning from the northern palace, he assumed the old seat of mist and rosy glow; resting on Eastern Mountain, he wore the rain and dew’s exceptional grace.\n\nThe illustrious title shines with glory, truly serving as the model for the gates of the Mysterious Dao.\n\nMoreover, we consider the revered master who oversees the mountain’s affairs: his jade-like essence and golden voice ascend to pay homage to the dragon’s resplendent play; his flawless pearl and unblemished jade dignify the crane’s hall of governance. In assisting the great accomplishment, his plans and strategies endure forever.\n\nMoreover, we consider the master of the Daoist Register who oversees the left division: his literary grace and historic purity, his majestic bearing like wind and thunder. Honored with the weight of golden seals, favored with the esteem of the precious pavilion, he especially aids the mountain forests and completes the halls and beams.\n\nAs for the divine treasures’ offices and the skilled artisans’ talents, their grand achievements and mighty deeds fittingly illuminate the Mysterious Pivot; their splendid promotions and fine reputations together ascend to the pure selection.\n\nAll things possess form and thus possess norms; the divine, being formless, is boundless. Resplendent are the carved pillars of the ornate halls, arrayed amidst clouds and mist. Suddenly, the painted walls encircle with inscriptions, lightning flashes across the sky. Jade chimes harmonize with the rainbow banners’ procession; the towered paths descend spirits with feathered regalia. Gem-like peaks and jade trees display the bearing of soaring dragons and leaping leopards; cloud pendants and rosy banners dignify the steps of cranes and phoenixes in attendance. This is the guard of a hundred spirits, the gaze and reliance of ten thousand families.\n\nSwiftly, twin rainbows rise, uniquely arraying the six celestial wefts.\n\n**To the East of the Beam:**\nThe sun’s radiance dawns, crimson upon the sea’s mounds; the sacred altar stands solemn, guarded by wind and thunder. Amidst the purple haze, the pass floats in the glow of dawn.\n\n**To the South of the Beam:**\nThe cinnabar carriage and crimson regalia descend upon phoenix glue; the bright court bestows distant celestial incense, the imperial palace’s edicts gleam upon the jeweled seals.\n\n**To the West of the Beam:**\nThe jade grove’s crisp air suffuses the misty cliffs; the jasper altar’s night candles burn with crimson light, the golden well’s divine spring murmurs in the Purple Tenuity.\n\n**Below the Beam:**\nFeathered pendants and morning jades align in procession; the Mysterious Wind stirs the four seas, awakening the people’s gaze. The Five Blessings are sung in harmony with the sagely transformation.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the beam’s raising, the imperial realm will expand boundlessly, the Dao’s virtue like spring’s radiance. A hundred blessings and a thousand auspices will equally bear the refining grace; the Five Winds and Ten Rains will all reside within nurturing embrace. The Dao’s transformation will grandly manifest, the true wind ever more vibrant.\n\n*Xianquan Ji*, Scroll Six concludes\n*Xianquan Ji*, Scroll Seven begins\n\n**A General Explication on the Transmission of the Three Primes**\n*Composed by Celestial Master Zhang Yu Chu of Mount Longhu, the Perfected of Non-Action*\n\nThe Great Void is profound and boundless, its subtle pattern obscure and minute—so ultimate it defies speech, so wondrous it eludes thought. Before sound or scent, form or name, the vast Brahman of the Qi River stretched empty and lightless. In that time, scripture had not yet arisen; it was inconceivable, immeasurable.\n\nWhen the Crimson Clarity unfolded its chart, heaven and earth were born, and the ten thousand existences took form. A hundred thousand layers of Dao-darkness coalesced into cloud-script, issuing forth as numinous texts. Only then did the myriad patterns unfold, the Five Canons scatter forth, preserving and regulating the kalpas, enduring with heaven itself. The transmission among true sages remains one in principle.\n\nFrom the Primordial Beginning’s discourse on the scriptures in the suspended millet-pearl radiance, the assembled perfected oversaw the conferral upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, and the Great Pattern first unfurled. After the Kaihuang era, the Great Vehicle of the Numinous Treasure was again transmitted, along with the *Purple Tenuity’s Flying Celestial Ten Divisions* and the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Red Writ Jade Chapters*, the *Chaotic Vastness Primal Nothingness Numinous Text*. The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavern Yang’s Hall, smelted it in the Flowing Fire’s Court—thus the Primordial Beginning Numinous Treasure’s mysterious root, the Cavernous Void’s spontaneous true writ, which generates heaven and establishes the pole, enlightens the divine luminaries, deploys its numinous might to pacify the Five Peaks, and brings peace to the realm and well-being to the people.\n\nTherefore, the Most High expounded the Jade Bureau, and the numinous writ spread forth. Then our Han Ancestor, the Celestial Master, descended in response to the transformation. In the first year of the Shanghuang era, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the Most High Lord of the Limitless Dao inscribed the Eight Upper Transformations. In the first year of the Limitless era, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he inscribed the Eight Middle Transformations. In the second year of the Limitless era, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he inscribed the Eight Lower Transformations.\n\nIn the second year of Han’an, on the fifteenth night of the first month, he was moved by the Golden Watchtower’s Later Sage Primordial Dao Lord, who descended upon Mount Heming in Western Shu. There, he conferred the *Secret Register of the Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Capital for Cultivating Perfection and Prolonging Life, with Flying Transformation*, along with the *Elbow-Behind Scripture and Oral Instructions*. In the seventh month of that year, he established the Twenty Western Treaties and transmitted them to his successor. Then, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he founded the Four Treaties to correspond with the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Thus, the Treaties encompass the Twenty-Four Qi, and each Qi governs Twenty-Four Offices. There are Twenty-Four Male and Female Officials, and Twenty-Four Male and Female Offices. Upon receiving their appointments, they follow the statutes and regulations to govern households and transform the people.\n\nThose who delight in the Dao and rejoice in the law, whose hearts are single-minded and wills unwavering, are delivered from calamity and granted extended years. They subdue the perverse and return to orthodoxy, dispel harm and expel demons, rescue the living and deliver the dead. In the highest degree, they may ascend in spirit and tread upon radiance, transcend ranks and attain perfection, ensuring that the teaching of the Three-Five endures for endless kalpas, and the true wind of Orthodox Unity flows without cease.\n\nThus, those who receive the transmission face the deities of the Treaties and deliverance, standing before the altar to divide the registers, thereby manifesting the gravity of the covenant. The Dao Lord once declared: “When I descended to the Shu capital, the Twenty-Four Treaties were all prisons of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, known as the Bureaus of the Dark Registers of Yin Radiance. There, I opened the Jade Dawn Palace of the Purple Yang Southern Court and conferred the *Secret Register of the Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Capital*. From it, I obtained the Way of traversing the Celestial Stem and treading the Dipper, the essentials of the Three Steps and Nine Traces.”\n\nHe once told the Ancestral Master Perfected Lord: “The Dao of Orthodox Unity was born from the primordial chaos, before the dark and yellow had taken shape, when purity and simplicity still prevailed. As the Great Simplicity began to scatter and the frivolous wind daily encroached, I feared the Dao-folk would be led astray by the perverse, the primordial qi would become mixed and confused, ghosts and demons would entangle them, calamities would arise wantonly, and they would fail to attain the true Dao, their heavenly years cut short by harm. Thus, I descended the Alliance威 tally to covenant against external perversity and rectify the internal primordial darkness—hence the name Orthodox Unity. Those who invoke it perceive the Dao of the undivided source. Therefore, this method is the gateway to all methods, encompassing the Upper Clarity’s Ten Transformations and Nine Changes, the Great Red’s *Hidden Writ of the Three-Nine Plain Words*.”\n\nThe Ancestral Master Perfected Lord also once instructed Perfected Wang: “The primordial darkness of the Chaotic Origin is fundamentally one. One generates two, two generates three—these are called the Three Primes. Three generates four, four generates five—these are the Five Phases. These Three Primes and Five Darknesses weave heaven and earth, transform the myriad things. Thus, the method of Orthodox Unity is born from the primordial darkness, dynamically transforming through the Five Phases—hence the name Three-Five Method. Those who uphold it align with the Three Primes of the Imperial Lords, stabilize the Five Phases, guard the principles of sun and moon, rectify the luminous and obscure, follow the sequence of thunder and lightning. There is no reckless movement in wind and clouds; the ten thousand things flourish in moisture. The realm knows no toil of warfare, the people suffer no afflictions of pestilence. Such is the great resonance of upholding the Orthodox Unity method.”\n\nThe Perfected Lord first dwelled in Songyang, then traversed the famous mountains east of the river, following the great gorges. Entering Shu, he subdued demons and vanquished specters, dividing the dark prisons into Twenty-Four Courts of Blessing and demoting the demon marshals to Twenty-Four Yin Officials. There, he encountered the Primordial Dao Lord, who again conferred upon him the *Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Way*, the *Three-Eight Flying Immortality and Life-Prolonging Arts*, and invested him as the Supreme Mystery Capital Orthodox Unity Perfected, assuming the Later Sage’s position of the Primordial, becoming the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. He was enfeoffed as the Lord of the Supreme Mystery Capital Orthodox Unity Pacification Darkness Palace.\n\nUpon pacifying the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens and completing his cultivation, the decree of the Three Heavens descended, and he ascended in broad daylight, taking his place among the Nine Clarities. Thus, the transmission of the Twenty-Four Rank Secret Registers all subdue the perverse and return to orthodoxy, greatly flourishing the numinous transformation to bless the myriad people. They descend the darkness of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, cultivate the governance of the Twenty-Four Darknesses, wear the talismanic cords and seals, command the generals and officials of the Treaties and Systems. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the Three Officials endorse and recommend them. Their names are inscribed in jade, they undergo corpse liberation and transformation, ascend to the rank of Perfected, and their seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessing. Hence, the transmission of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements’ scriptures and registers expands and propagates the secret and wondrous, universally delivering the boundless.\n\nThe above serves to safeguard and secure the nation’s destiny, ensuring it endures with Heaven, while below it bestows blessings upon the living and the deceased, so that all under Heaven rejoice. Thus, within the Purple Yang Inner Palace, the *Jade Dawn Orthodox Unity* secret canon unfolds and expounds the profound and subtle—rightly so.\n\nTo this day, after forty-three transmissions, it has received the sacred favor and flowed forth from the ancestral altar. Now, on this auspicious festival of the Upper Prime, the day when the Heavenly Officials review the records, the chief disciple of the central altar, [Name], presents golden offerings in devotion, beseeching the descent of profound grace. Practitioners from the ten directions, adorned with talismans, gather at the ancestral altar. Thus, the high companions of the Dharma ocean, the pure assembly of the lecture hall, purify body and mind, desiring to hear the supreme Dao.\n\nAs the scriptures say: “From the void and spontaneity the Dao arises; the True One is undivided, its essence serene. Round and luminous, self-sufficient, it does not fall into views, far removed from dust and defilement. Learning is no-learning, cultivation is no-cultivation—within this, all is clearly understood. Neither departing nor abiding, neither death nor birth—this is true awakening.” How could this not be deeply and brilliantly evident?\n\nCultivated inwardly, it is the Dao of the Golden Elixir’s return to the Three and Five; applied outwardly, it is the wondrous efficacy of the *Numinous Treasure’s* Ten Revolutions of the True One. Expounded, it becomes the texts of the *Purple Pivot* and *Flying Sanskrit*, the records of the *Cinnabar Scripts* and *Numinous Charts*. Universally delivering heaven and humanity, its merit is boundless. Thus, the transmission of the Supreme’s various scriptures and registers, originating from this, fully encompasses the Dao of responsive transformation.\n\nFor the pivot of creation can transform our people—like Heaven descending and Earth ascending, encircled by sun and moon, activated by thunder and lightning. Its mechanism operates without speech, yet benefits the parched and gives life. Thus, those endowed with humanity are neither enhanced by wisdom nor diminished by folly; it lies in turning inward to seek the inherent goodness, moment by moment returning to the real, pure and undivided. Only then, embracing the mysterious and guarding the One, restoring simplicity and preserving the true, are the Dao of fulfilling one’s nature and destiny fully realized.\n\nTherefore, the myriad things share a single root, moving in harmony with Heaven and Earth without conflict. The Dao’s foundation lies in emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and non-action. Applied to family and state, extended to heaven and humanity, there is no realm where it does not prevail. Its responses to the two realms (spiritual and mundane) all arise from the true texts and numinous talismans, which avert calamity and bring forth auspiciousness—truly, there is a reason for this.\n\nThus, its benefits extend beyond merely blessing the living and the dead. Bathed in the Supreme’s nurturing grace, its boundlessness is assured. Tonight, ascending this Dharma seat, the High Perfected of the Celestial Court bear witness to the covenant. The six realms of existence and the four sagely ranks form the audience. Briefly expounding these teachings, may profound awakening be attained.\n\nAll good and faithful people, all sentient beings, may you equally ascend to benevolence and longevity. May none remain bound in the unseen, but together reach the shore of the Dao. Having stood long, take care.\n\n*Universal Refining and Deliverance: A General Exhortation*\n\nWe have heard that the wondrous precepts of the *Cavern of Perfection* and the jade texts of the *Numinous Treasure* uphold the nation’s destiny for ten thousand years and deliver the suffering souls from the vast kalpas. Their prohibitions are most solemn, their divine power beyond thought. They universally deliver the departed spirits who, having long transgressed the true Dao, willingly endure cycles of retribution. First, the sacred milk of the Dharma must be widely proclaimed to illuminate their true nature, that they may swiftly awaken and early depart the dark paths.\n\nOriginally, before the beginning of the Limitless, prior to the Great Origin, there were no signs, no omens. Then the Great Simplicity first dispersed, yin and yang first divided, Heaven was established and the pole set, the myriad things were born and nurtured, the Three Powers stood together, and humanity dwelt among them. Yang transformed and yin united, the Five Phases congealed, the Two Qi circulated. All things, born together with Heaven and Earth, equally received the One Qi and took form. With form came endowed nature—this is the flowing of Heaven’s mandate.\n\nWhen the Three Luminaries shine together, the Five Peaks stand in majesty, the wonders of thunder and the teachings of rain and dew—nothing, from the vast to the minute, lacks the fullness of innate knowledge. There is no single thing that does not possess this Supreme Ultimate. The divine Dao establishes teachings to deliver the world and transform humanity—only this.\n\nThus it is said: “The Dao of Heaven and Earth is undivided in its manifestation.” In Confucius and Mencius, it is called benevolence and righteousness; in Śākyamuni, perfect enlightenment; in Zhuangzi and Liezi, emptiness and non-being; in Xunzi and Yangzi, the balance of power; in Ban Gu and Sima Qian, literary expression. Flowing into the hundred crafts and thousand arts, it does not depart from the inch of the heart. Though paths differ, the return is one—myriad things share a single root.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth and all existence are bound to form and qi, confined to the cycles of arising and ceasing, flourishing and withering, formation and decay. Human life, with the stirring of consciousness, is assailed day and night by incessant disturbance, never a moment’s rest. Ears hear, eyes see, mouth tastes, heart thinks—all are obscured by desire, entangled by emotion, seized by circumstances, lured by objects.\n\nFor nature flows into emotion, emotion blazes into thought, thought accumulates into anxiety, anxiety endures into consciousness. Thus, within the seven apertures, the six desires and five aggregates, the three poisons—all greed, anger, hatred, love, joy, resentment, conflict, and opposition—entangle and bind, growing ever deeper and more fixed. One sinks into the dust of the root-qi’s single boat, bound by clinging thoughts, even to the point of owing karmic debts through love and desire, forming enmity. Mistaking strangers for kin, enmity and kinship intertwine, mutually avenging. Thus, the body’s senses arise, and circumstances follow the mind’s birth.\n\nAll adverse and favorable, good and evil circumstances, with the slightest movement, become obstacles. With form comes the sprouting of a single thought, pursuing delusion and illusion. For a hundred thousand kalpas, the turning never ceases—rising in the east, setting in the west, emerging and submerging. Even wood and stone, without memory, are constantly moved, all due to a single thought’s deviation. Thus, a thousand lifetimes of suffering arise, one’s spirit sinking, drifting, scattered, and confused, with no end in sight.\n\nAt first, the skandhas of form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness seem real, giving rise to the retributions of heaven and hell. Yet they know not that earth, water, fire, wind, sound, and form are all empty flowers.\n\nDelusion.\n\nSince the vast kalpas of primordial chaos, through the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, suffering and affliction have been boundless. Thus, the Great Unity above, possessing the virtue of cherishing life, opened the gate of expedient means, arising in great compassion to universally guide all beings, enabling them to abandon delusion and return to truth, equally attaining the supreme fruit of the Dao, gaining immeasurable blessings, and forever emerging from deep delusion.\n\nCarefully examined: The Primordial Celestial Unity, the Most High, suspended a precious pearl in the Azure Heaven of Beginnings, summoning the thousand perfected ones to expound the precepts of the Mysterious and Yellow qi. All entering into formation, abiding, decay, and destruction are created by the mind and veiled by wind, the four great elements merely a temporary convergence. All that possesses form is but illusion; only the formless is perfectly luminous, eternally unfolding its wondrous teachings. These were transmitted to the Jade Emperor, the Numinous Treasure Dao Lord, and thus the Three Grades of the Numinous Treasure Dao emerged.\n\nNext, they were passed to the Five Elder Thearchs and the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct. King Zhen of Jade Purity opened the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, issuing the talismanic decree to shatter hell. The Great Emperor of Azure Splendor opened the Left Mansion of Azure Splendor, issuing the Nine Dragons Talismanic Decree. The Venerable Lord Han opened the Vermilion Spring Mansion of Spring, issuing the Talismanic Decree to Deliver Souls from Darkness. The Three Assisting Perfected Ones opened the Yellow Register Court, issuing the Yellow Register Perfected Talismans. Thus, the Three Masters of Antiquity, through the *Millet and Pearl Scripture*, expounded the arcane texts of refinement and deliverance, liberating the souls of the dead and extending blessings to the myriad kinds.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy transmitted these to the Grand Pure Dao and Virtue Celestial Worthy, who in turn passed them to the Great Recluse, the Master of Myriad Things, who entrusted them to the *Flying Celestial Jade Scripts of the Ten Divisions*, thereby unfolding their subtleties in an unbroken lineage. By the Han dynasty, our ancestral Celestial Master received the transmission of the Orthodox Unity, its texts still flourishing.\n\nAt the beginning of the Han, the *Chaotic Red Writ of Brahmā’s Net*, inscribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, consisted entirely of cavernous numinous talismans. Above, they safeguard the turning of the kalpas and eliminate the three disasters; below, they refine the souls of the dead and deliver the living. Universally proclaimed to the boundless divine realms, the Northern Metropolis of the Yellow Springs, they swiftly erase the ledgers of sin, extinguishing the roots of evil. Then, demon kings offer protection, earth officials escort the departed, and souls are delivered from the earthly gates to ascend as perfected beings.\n\nYet, as the world declines and customs grow shallow, the arcane texts and profound canons remain hidden in the celestial treasuries, transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas—only to those who have planted numinous roots in past lives. How could their boundless wonders be carelessly revealed? Their mysteries are of the utmost gravity; how could the negligent or arrogant fathom their subtleties?\n\nTheir wonder lies in delivering people. The merit of delivering others is often heard from the immortal masters: \"The Numinous Treasure is the Golden Elixir’s treasure.\" If metal and wood remain separate, water and fire estranged, how can nature and life merge, returning to the origin and restoring the root? One must establish the cauldron and vessel of heaven and earth, refine the medicinal substances of Kan and Li, capture the leaping hare, unite the black dragon and tiger, gather the primordial True Unity’s qi as the foundation, and take the mechanism of yin-yang’s movement as the model. In motion, it arises from the Nine Yangs; in stillness, it follows the sixty-four hexagrams as the fire phases of the celestial cycle. The circulation adheres to the three yin and six yang, yet the Numinous Treasure’s completeness lies in the Numinous Treasure.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is the Numinous Treasure; the four lines of the hexagram serve as the tally for ascent and descent. The wonder of inversion, the mechanism of reversal—extracting mercury from cinnabar—though myriad sages may ponder, none can fully grasp it! Thus, even the slightest deviation cannot be tolerated; the wonder lies in the Dao of the Three and Five returning to One. Open the crescent moon, move the celestial root, circulate along the ecliptic through the celestial cycle. Discern the embryonic spirit’s transformation in the dark chamber, the mysterious merging into form, refining and returning to truth.\n\nOf old, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign attained the Dao of the Nine-Five, and the Lords of the Five Thunders attained the Dao of the Three-One, differing not from this. For the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* reveal the root of heaven and earth’s generation. As for the Numinous Treasure: spirit congeals into numinosity, qi gathers into treasure. One must gather the qi of the primordial chaos and profound darkness, refine the essence of the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit, traverse the Southern Dipper, cross the Eastern Well, activate the true fire of utmost yang, and descend the yellow essence of great yin. Thus, Kan’s lunar essence and Li’s solar radiance merge, the five qi circulate through the celestial cycle, form arising from the formless, ascending directly to the Vermilion Numinous Realm.\n\nThis is the universal deliverance: the dead refined, the living delivered, souls crossing the Vermilion Numinous Realm to undergo refinement and rebirth. It is the emptiness of the One symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate, returning to non-being. Thus, the perfected cultivate it to refine themselves and extend it to deliver others. It is indeed the true yang of heaven and earth, transmuting yin spirits, ceaselessly ascending and advancing.\n\nKnow then that the Numinous Treasure is another name for the Golden Elixir. You, suffering souls, have endured kalpas of torment. Now, through the merit of the assembly leader [Name], the supreme great fast is established, a celebration of a thousand lives, allowing you to bathe in the Dao’s compassion and be instantly delivered. Having heard these wondrous teachings, they will forever become the seed of sagehood within you.\n\nYour dharma-body of self-nature is originally without defilement, without birth or death. Yet, deluded by false illusions, you remain without awakening. The scripture states: \"The beings of the three realms are originally without transmigration; the True Unity’s qi is originally without birth or death. The苦 sea is boundless; turn your head, and the shore is near.\" Thus it is said: \"When understood, karmic obstacles are fundamentally empty; when not understood, one must repay past debts.\"\n\nIf the wise hear or see evil, they must know and awaken to it, sweeping it away. The foolish, lacking all aspiration, blindly wander in darkness and must urgently awaken. Those in wealth and nobility are entangled in every thought; those in poverty and lowliness cling to every thought. Having created these karmic causes, how can they escape the cycle of rebirth?\n\nTherefore, the masters of former times ceased all activity, like cold ashes or dead embers, withered wood or stubborn stone. Only by stilling this single thought can one illuminate all delusions, not clinging to a single speck of dust.\n\nMoreover, there is no beginning to coming, no end to going—birth is fundamentally non-birth, death fundamentally non-death. The wondrous existence of the single spirit endures eternally in an instant.\n\nThis arises from love as its root and accumulated thoughts as its karma, giving rise to manifold rebirths and manifold karmic retributions. Through a thousand lives they revolve, through ten thousand kalpas they suffer, ceaselessly turning without self-awareness. Disciples of the four assemblies, receiving the deliverance of departed spirits: I speak without tongue, you listen without mind. In that realm beyond speech and hearing, awaken fiercely—ultimately transcending all conditions, surpassing all illusions—then the three karmas and six senses will be instantly purified. Turning back, you suddenly realize that all past entanglements of suffering and joy are fundamentally unattainable. In this direct recognition, you realize that originally there was no birth, and now there is no death. Even the search for entanglements yields nothing—how much less do all deluded thoughts of existence and non-existence remain?\n\nDo not assume this was possessed before birth and lost after death. Whether from kalpa to kalpa, abandoning one body to enter another, you remain indestructible. It is only your own delusion. If you clearly awaken to your inherent nature and contemplate your wondrously pure, luminous mind—radiant and numinous—it transcends speech and silence, movement and stillness, and clings neither to existence nor to boundaries. Like a mirror polished of all grime, the moon appears in the still water. The emptiness that is not empty is true emptiness; the thought that is without thought is right thought. In every movement, thorough illumination; in every thought, perfect interpenetration—truly, \"a thousand rivers hold water, a thousand rivers hold the moon; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky.\"\n\nIf you do not shatter these barriers, you will forever remain in the old rut. You must directly perceive and bear witness—do not let this moment slip by. A hundred thousand Dharma gates, infinite wondrous meanings—all converge in a single moment of awakening. From this, when not a single thought arises, all conditions become still. Even the sins as numerous as grains of sand vanish, and only this original face remains—the true immortal and Dao ancestor. How then could there be hells or evil destinies, or the ceaseless suffering of rebirth?\n\nWhen this ultimate realization is attained, all illusions are empty, and the One Reality alone manifests. The vast emptiness is without form—this is your true nature. Having heard this Dharma sound, the assembly suddenly awakens, recognizing their original true nature. They turn from the cycle of rebirth and never regress. Constantly guarding and upholding this, they become vast and perfectly luminous, utterly free from obstruction. Gazing upon all forms, what remains? Thus they transcend the Three Realms and wander freely in the Upper Clarity.\n\nYet for those souls still mired in the lower realms who have not fully realized the true and constant, it is fitting to transmit the precepts to prevent their fall. With reverence, the Nine Wondrous Precepts are proclaimed one by one. First, take refuge in the Three Treasures, that they may have a foundation. Let the departed souls of the netherworld be instructed, and let each uphold them.\n\n**Transmission of the Dharma, General Exposition**\n\nIn the beginning of the Great Ultimate, the primordial chaos first divided, and from this arose the separation of yin and yang. Heaven and earth took their places, and the ten thousand things were nurtured. The Five Phases emerged, and the myriad transformations were born—thus, generation upon generation, transformation upon transformation, without end.\n\nThe Five Phases are but yin and yang; yin and yang are but the Great Ultimate. By the flowing movement of Heaven’s mandate, it bestows upon the ten thousand things their nature. When nature sprouts, principle is inherent within; when principle manifests, emotions appear without—all governed by the life and death of yin and yang, the ascent and descent of the Five Phases. Thus, water and fire clash, thunder and lightning strike, hardness and softness grind, the eight trigrams interact. Stirred by thunder and lightning, moistened by wind and rain, the workings of yin and yang are overseen by the divine ruler.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the ten thousand things are governed by the Emperor. Yet movement and stillness have no origin, yin and yang no beginning. In the human heart, this ruler is called the Emperor; its wondrous functioning is called spirits and gods. The vastness of heaven and earth is bound to yin and yang—how could it lack a ruler? This is what is meant by the Emperor.\n\nThe ancestral lineage of our Dao traces back to the Primordial Heavenly King, who, after the Opening of the Imperial Era, transmitted the Great Vehicle of the Numinous Treasure, the *Scriptures of the Ten Departments of the Purple Tenuity Flying Heaven*, to the Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord and the Nine Divine Empyreans of the Divine Empyrean. Later, descending upon Mount Emei, he bestowed upon the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign the methods of refinement and deliverance. At the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Nine Yangs of spontaneous qi emerged. The Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to take up the brush and compose the text, which was concealed in the Cavern of Yang. When the Vermilion Numinous Fire Treasury was opened, the scriptures for reviving the dead and restoring life were entrusted to him—thus, the *Scriptures of Millet Pearls* unfolded into the texts of refinement and deliverance.\n\nDuring the Dragon Han kalpa, the Dao Lord was also bestowed with the wondrous and mysterious Dao of Pure Tenuity, while the Elder Lord received the inner methods of the Primordial Response. Thus, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy transmitted the *Perfect Formula of Pure Tenuity and Mysterious Penetration* to the Heavenly Emperor of Wondrous Transformation, and the Most High transmitted it to him. Our ancestral Heavenly Master of the Han orally transmitted this as the Orthodox Lineage of Pure Tenuity. Later, in the Yuan dynasty, it was presented to the Imperial Consort Yuan, the Radiant Ancestral Mother, and thus unified as the *Pure Tenuity, Numinous Treasure, Dao Virtue, Orthodox Unity*.\n\nThe Perfected Xu of the Great Ultimate cultivated the Dao and attained realization. By the command of the Most High, he was entrusted with the *Ten Wondrous Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*. The Perfected Xu transmitted them to the Three Assistant Perfected Ones, under whose charge all matters of deliverance were placed. The Three Assistant Perfected Ones transmitted them to the Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, from whom the lineage of the Numinous Treasure flourished and spread. Those who propagated its teachings—such as Du, Lu, Ning, and Zhang—achieved the greatest prominence. Among those who transmitted it to later generations, none were more eminent than the two patriarchs, Lin and Bai. This is called the *Emergence of the Cavern Real, Deliverance of Humanity*, provisionally named the *Primordial Beginning*; the *Succession of the Cavern Mystery*, alternatively called the *Numinous Treasure*; and the *Elaboration of the Cavern Spirit*, named the *Dao Virtue*. Though these three differ in name, in reality they are one.\n\nFormerly, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected King of Jade Clarity to open the Vermilion Numinous Fire Treasury, the Great Emperor of Azure Radiance to open the Left Treasury of Azure Radiance, and the Venerable Lord Han to open the Right Treasury of the Vermilion Numinous. The Three Assistant Perfected Ones opened the Yellow Register Court and produced the talismans of the *Jade Clarity, Earth-Prison Breaking*, and the texts of the *Three Writs and Five Talismans*. In all practices of refinement and deliverance, when proclamations are issued to the netherworld gates, none fail to awaken.\n\nThe above is called the *Divine Empyrean*, descending from the *Limpid Tenuity*; all these are its texts. Thus, the Supreme Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Perfected King, the Great Emperor of Longevity, exclusively governs the Nine Empyreans and the Thirty-Six Heavens’ Worthies. The Thirty-Six Heavens’ Worthies are solely commanded by the Great Emperor, who oversees the primordial configurations and holds dominion over yin and yang. Therefore, the administration of thunder and lightning is entirely subject to him.\n\nFormerly, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign attained the Way of the Nine and Five. The Scripture states: \"One who attains the Way of the Nine and Five becomes the Emperor of Thunder.\" The Five Thunder Lords thus obtained the Way of the Three-in-One Thunder. Three is the ancestral number of the East, and One is the generative number of the North.\n\nThe Immortal Master said: \"The Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign revealed the utmost truth, manifesting the Three and Five to deliver ordinary beings.\" In the *Numinous Treasure* teachings, the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the solar essence and lunar spirit, ceaselessly ascend and descend in the interplay of yin and yang. The method by which the dead are refined and the living delivered lies in using one’s yang spirit to refine their yin souls, thereafter harmonizing yin and yang to return to the Supreme Ultimate, merging nature and destiny to revert to the primordial origin. Thus it is said: \"Congeal the spirit into numinosity, gather the qi into treasure.\" Spirit is nature; qi is destiny. For the Empty Cavern descends numinosity, the Great Void generates spirit, and the Golden Womb of the Void is the true within the true. Therefore, the spirit and qi are concealed within the Three Fields and Five Viscera, drawing from the celestial *Ren* and *Hao* constellations. By repeatedly tasting the sweet dew, one gathers emotions to restore nature, gathers nature to return to the root. With water and fire in mutual completion, the Way of nature and destiny is perfected.\n\nThus, the Dao draws upon the sun and moon within oneself, and the method follows the symbolic patterns of water and fire. With one’s own luminous yang nature, one awakens the yin spirit of the other. Borrowing the qi of the Nine Empyreans and Nine Yangs, one refines the substance and purges the form, riding the compassionate radiance of the Supreme Emperor to dispel the darkness of the Nine Springs. Only then are sins extinguished, the spirit made whole, and transformation into life achieved.\n\nThe Wood of the East Three combines with the Fire of the South Two—this is the dragon reborn in fire. The Metal of the West Four combines with the Water of the North One—this is the tiger reborn in water. Wu and Ji are the Earth of the central intent, the marvel of the Three and Five united as One. Precisely as it is said: \"With Kan and Li in mutual completion, all returns to the center; only then does one realize the merit of the Three and Five.\"\n\nAs for talismans, registers, writs, and incantations, as well as the protocols and ritual texts, these are the graded ranks of the Dharma-gate, serving as the ladder and ferry for entering the Dao, the direct path to seeking the true. If one does not seek it within oneself, how can one use the merit of self-cultivation to deliver others? Upon investigation, the ultimate principle is never not one.\n\nThe Five Thunder Lords, having attained the Way of the Three-in-One, manifest the wondrous function of the Two Dipper Stars, which is the numerology of the *River Chart*. Thus, the Three-in-One is no different from the Nine and Five. For the pivot of yin and the mechanism of yang, thunder is good and lightning is fierce; yang thunder and yin lightning together govern the Seventy-Two Bureaus of Thunder. Thus, the *Kui* and *Ji* constellations serve as the offices for summoning thunder and dispatching lightning.\n\nIn thunder and lightning, the central qi of Heaven and Earth is obtained. Jia and Geng are the commands of thunder and lightning, which is the function of the Nine and Five. Ren is the configuration of thunder, Bing is the convergence of thunder, and Zi is the origin of thunder. Thus, Zi is the first configuration of thunder, Mao is the gate of thunder, Wu and Gui are the offices of thunder-fire. When combined with the cyclical transformations of *Yanlü*, *Shunshen*, and *Gengshen*, all derive from the marvel of the Nine and Five. Through the Fire Master Wang the Perfected and the Perfected King of the Awaited Palace, the transmission of the Thunder Mother was fully revealed.\n\nHumans, endowed with a single numinous spirit, together with Heaven and Earth form the Three Powers. The transformations of a single body’s yin and yang proceed in unison with Heaven and Earth without deviation. Alas! A single point of numinous clarity illumines Heaven and Earth; from ancient times to the present, none have recognized it. The Confucians call it \"empty numinosity without obscuration,\" the Buddhists call it the \"wondrously pure bright mind.\" Directly awakening to it, it is neither mind nor one; suddenly encountering it, it is neither Zen nor distant. The Scripture states: \"Heaven issues its fierce mechanism, Heaven and Earth overturn; when Heaven and humanity are aroused, the old foundation is transformed.\" That which is called \"humanity’s convergence with the Dao\"—is this not the pivot of yin and the mechanism of yang?\n\nWhen humans align with Heaven, harmony is achieved through the balance of yin and yang. Ghosts and spirits are the spontaneous functions of the Two Qi. By employing the mechanism of one’s own opening and closing to command them, this evokes and that responds. It begins with the Great Brahma’s primordial void, prior to the *Hun Dun* Red Script. Thereafter, the Five Classics unfold, and the myriad norms expand. The Five Scripts open and extend, universally establishing the numinous spirits. Thus, there is no scripture that does not deliver, no scripture that does not generate life.\n\nIn great matters, it can safeguard and stabilize the nation’s destiny, verify the Dao, and attain perfection. In small matters, it can protect oneself, pacify the household, aid others, and benefit all things. All are the comings and goings of a single qi, the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases. With one’s own primordial spirit from the infinite kalpas, one commands the spirits of the formless void. When spirit and qi unite, qi arrives and numinosity follows.\n\nThus, it is said: \"Do not depart from the present moment’s constant clarity; seek to know the lord who cannot be seen.\" The establishment of the Dharma-gate of the Divine Empyrean for a single day is like the palm encompassing yin and yang, the executioner issuing commands, the messenger stirring the Milky Way, the thunder gate exchanging the movements of water and fire, the *Cavern Mystery* opening and closing the yin and yang, the Earth Lord strategizing the killing of spirits and deities, the arrow-killing techniques piercing the stellar luminaries. Below, there are the texts of Deng and Yue; above, there is the qi and the incantation. Thus, the divine methods of the moon and the divine techniques of the law are all derived from the wondrous functions within oneself, not merely from paper talismans and bodily postures. The method is the function of the Dao; the ritual is the vehicle of the method. The myriad spirits are but a single movement of the primordial Great Dao. When employing one’s own primordial spirit, filling it expands to pervade the Six Voids, gathering it contracts to not exceed a handful. How could the minute and the vast not be one? When one spirit moves, the myriad spirits follow.\n\nThe Immortal Master said: \"Establish the Dao, and the method is also established; establish the method, and the Dao is also established.\" For embryo respiration, use the apertures; in every method, the heart must be able to penetrate the heart. Then one knows that gathering this is the true essential marvel of the method. Therefore, those who engage in cultivation must first investigate the wondrous function of the Mysterious Pass, the true source of water and fire, and the marvel of returning to the root and restoring destiny. Only then can one unite the myriad in the one, and the hundred considerations converge into one.\n\nShould one fail to inwardly illuminate one’s nature—comprehending the celestial Dao and the thunderous heart-ground—how could one still the flesh to refine the golden elixir, or move like a thunderclap? Yet one must first temper conduct with resolute integrity and forge the path with diligent perseverance.\n\nThe Master said: \"Within the real dwells the spirit; beyond sincerity, no method exists.\" Thus, preserving sincerity and nurturing qi form the essence, while penetrating the wondrous and seizing the mechanism serve as function. If one can embrace the origin and guard the one, steering darkness to congeal the spirit, the six senses dissolve into purity, the true singularity emerges, and I become the Thunderous Great Dharma King—what need remains for talismans, incantations, or secret formulas?\n\nThough ascending to the Three Realms and transcending the myriad illusions may seem arduous, it is not so. The power to benefit and aid extends even to the mud-pill and mugwort, for both may lodge the handle of darkness and spirit. Thus, conversing and laughing amidst the wind and thunder are but trifling matters for me.\n\nYet the mysteries of transmission and reception, the secrets of talismanic script—all are inscribed in the golden statutes and jade regulations. Were they not transmitted through celestial descent, one by one, would there not arise the peril of beginning with zeal and ending in neglect? Therefore, the wondrous treasure of celestial truth is passed down through kalpas, with the descent of the celestial true origin governed by solemn vows and weighty covenants.\n\nNow, the disciples beneath the altar, blessed across a thousand lives to ascend the immortal ranks, have received the lofty and profound transmission in accordance with the statutes. Thus, this numinous canon is expounded so that they may know the source from the stream, seek the root and discard the branches, and turn inward for an ever-abundant teacher.\n\nLet none dare to treat these teachings with frivolous leakage or negligence, lest they violate the prohibitions. One must instead refine conduct with discipline, delve into the profound mysteries, and persist in cultivation without cease. As object and self are forgotten and spirit and illumination merge as one, shall one not tread the luminous path to transcendence and unite with the Great Void?\n\nAfter all, before heaven and earth divided, where did the brush first touch? The myriad methods return to the one, but where does the one return? Let each strive diligently in receiving these teachings, without negligence.\n\n**On the Restoration of the Yifa Guanzhou Monastery**\n\nThis monastery’s origins trace to the late Han, its foundations laid in the early Tang. By the flourishing Yuan, after centuries of decline, it had undergone repairs—yet the labor was vast. We now humbly appeal to the virtuous, entreating their aid in recompense, that this noble endeavor may be fulfilled.\n\nIt was the Celestial Master who descended as the Star of Literary Brilliance, cradled in auspicious clouds of lotus and kingfisher silk. The mountains, steeped in the numen of Liang and Chu, harbored dragon-tiger omens. The temple halls first rose in the Han, the palace courts flourished in the Tang. Through twelve hundred years, the twenty-four sacred precincts saw the Dao’s lineage grow ever more revered, the true wind ever more resplendent.\n\nAlas! Storms and time have shaken its beams, leaving corridors to crumble and hemp to overgrow. Though the transmission of the teachings demands restoration, it is also the duty of true disciples to forge karmic ties. With brushstrokes that summon spring, may we witness Wang Chang’s peaches ripen anew; with vows made beneath the moon, may Zhao Lang’s tripod gleam once more. Let these halls of mother-of-pearl and pearl be no different from the cinnabar terraces and purple palaces. Let names be inscribed in the *Record of Longevity*, that blessings flow endlessly; let merits be recorded in the *Great Possession*, that auspicious order prevail. May the mystic wind endure forever, and the nation’s destiny know no bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for the Restoration of Jing Tong Hermitage**\n\nJing Tong Hermitage was the cultivation ground of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, the Perfected Lord Xu Jing. Born in the Xihe reign of the Song, he once gathered disciples atop Rounded Mountain, his merit and conduct resplendent. By the Chongning era, Emperor Huizong’s veneration of the Dao reached its zenith. Alongside the imperial attendants Wang Wenqing and Lin Lingsu, he enjoyed singular favor—his prayers and sacrifices to the cypress groves yielding wondrous signs. Soon after, the Song court fell, and the Perfected Lord, like his peers, attained liberation through seated transcendence. His surpassing deeds are fully chronicled in the records.\n\nYet the hermitage, built between the Song and Yuan, has suffered repeated devastation by war and fire, its reconstructions many. With the passage of years, its structures have inevitably decayed. Though this mountain’s restoration should take precedence, our strength is insufficient—we must rely on the collective karmic ties. Thus, we present this humble petition to the benevolent and generous, entreating their gold to accomplish this noble work. May the Perfected Lord’s numinous assembly, together with the multitude, bestow undying grace.\n\nThe Dao was honored when the Han court established the thirty celestial transmissions; the teachings unfolded when the Song dynasty penetrated the five thousand words’ mysteries. At the height of Emperor Huizong’s reverence, in concert with the illustrious attendants’ merits, he stationed brave generals in the palace courts and banished demonic dragons from the tides. Azure dragons and white tigers stood like emerald bamboo and jade parasols; red horses and vermilion sheep remained in the green annals and purple archives. Having adorned this hallowed ground, we must not forget the toil of its decay. To renew it, we must seek the aid of the wellsprings of generosity. As cranes return to the Liaohan Sea, may we gaze again upon the solitary flight toward the jade pavilion; as crows transform over the Sizhou Isles, may we rejoice in the towering splendor of the Jasper Terrace. Together, let us contribute to imperial favor and share in the numinous blessings.\n\n*End of Volume Seven of the Jianquan Collection*\n*Volume Eight of the Jianquan Collection*\n\n**The \"Ode to Tranquil Vastness\" by Zhang Yuchu, the Non-Action Heavenly Master of Qishan**\n\nWhen the Great Beginning’s profound vastness first stirred,\nMyriad things drew sustenance from its generative power.\nFrom the primal chaos, the first chisel struck,\nAnd celestial patterns were arrayed as constancy’s script.\nRooted in movement and stillness, the first distinctions arose,\nAlternating in marvelous pairs to form the Five Phases.\nThe sun’s charts and the earth’s records took this as their rule,\nEstablishing the Three Poles as the measure of all things.\nNow bending, now rising in boundless expanse,\nThey vie in length through the work of creation.\nWhen the Three and Five wondrously unite,\nThey coil like the pivot of a wheel, congealing within.\nSwaddled in swaddling clothes, the infant stirs,\nResplendent yet elusive in its radiance.\nVast and empty, still and serene,\nOne seeks the dark pearl in the formless net.\nA single grain of millet hangs in the void,\nMajestic as clouds ascending and rainbows gleaming.\nEmbrace the compass within the hidden abyss!\nExpand the floating vessel to harmonize the pure.\nThe heavens and earth revolve in cyclic gestation,\nHarmonizing descent and ascent like the turning of a wheel.\nBathe in the Sun Valley and ascend to the imperial,\nSoaring on mighty winds in boundless flight.\nUrging forth the linked stalks of wisdom’s harvest,\nI pay homage to the Radiant Lord in his dazzling splendor.\nSipping jade nectar and cassia wine,\nI am veiled in the lush fragrance of jasper beams.\nThen he bestowed upon me the words: \"Vast and formless,\nTranscend the tranquil vastness beyond the faintest echo.\"\nThus I cleanse this great defilement,\nReturning the dark essence to its hidden store.\nI mount the dim and frail carriage of the black-robed one,\nDriving the six black steeds in their lush array.\nPiercing the bright with the fullness of the dark,\nI rein in my pace to move as a single breath.\nHow endless the cycles of beginning without end,\nSwirling and eddying in ceaseless transformation!\nI aspire to soar afar and attain it,\nFor only then may I savor the pure and true.\nPine and Paulownia, long-lived and proud,\nWhat kinship have they with the common cypress?\nYet do they truly trust in fleeting life,\nLurking in the hardships of cliffs and valleys?\nTheir wills stand firm as ice and frost,\nWhile the illusory world is but drifting dust.\nHow can splendor be called beauty?\nMired in filth, what room is there for debate?\nAlas, my life is fraught with dullness,\nMy aspirations lingering in past fragrance.\nThe tangled threads of ancestral teachings,\nDampen my heart’s unspoken longing.\nI yearn to delight in the great transformation,\nYet my balance beam is broken, my hidden thread concealed.\nI cast aside indolence and lay down my staff,\nKnocking at the vast gate to seek the ford.\nI renounce the early cravings of mulberry and river,\nFor the great sound resounds like a distant echo.\nWhy treasure the gourd as a jewel,\nWhen what use are the tripods of Shang?\nI lament the discord of handle and socket,\nAs if my nature were estranged from its former fragrance.\nWhy still cling to the glow of fame,\nSighing in weariness for fleeting glory?\nWho does not fortify their resolve?\nEven the ancient sages prized steadfastness.\nYang Xiong guarded the mysterious,\nPraising the root and cherishing the hidden gate.\nQu Yuan’s *Far Roaming*,\nAlso preserved its vital qi within.\nDredging the turbid to await the empty,\nI rinse my mouth and hesitate.\nGazing afar at the distant corners of the world,\nI should follow purity and shed my husk like a cicada.\nOnly Jia Yi’s lament for the roc,\nUnderstood life and death as no cause for concern.\nHow much better to ride the limpid wind,\nAnd reach the lightning’s strike without harm!\nCast off the excrescences of the self,\nFor what are things but fleeting bubbles?\nFalling like morning stars in desolation,\nOnly a trace of light lingers and fades.\nI grieve the dusty altar’s crudeness,\nWandering alone in sorrow and dismay.\nI weave orchid sashes to leave behind,\nPlucking ivy and dodder to untie my bonds.\nI long to follow the fragrant steps,\nYet the lofty flight remains distant, and I am but a guest.\nI gather dew upon chrysanthemum blossoms,\nMoved by their purity, my form grows faint.\nI equal self and other in a grain of rice,\nUnconcerned by the desolation of the road.\nI gaze up at the soaring phoenix,\nWhy begrudge its virtue’s radiance?\nFearful of the lame tortoise’s plodding,\nI ride the glue-bound axle without reins.\nI seek to knock at the Red Mound,\nYet who knows the mystery of wordless silence?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of Qishan\"**\n\nAt the mountain’s peak,\nNone gaze upon the tortoise.\nThe trees of Mount Lu,\nUnscarred by axe or adze.\nIn the mountain’s seclusion,\nI dwell alone.\nMy will left behind,\nThe world sees only me.\nWhen the imperial first arose,\nAlas, where was I to witness it?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of the Woodcutter’s Return\"**\n\nI nest in the forest,\nWho sees my cares?\nLong have I yearned,\nHow dare I not follow?\nThose who cherish the ancients,\nOnly guard their constancy.\nI gather firewood,\nWhy let it be felled and harmed?\nThat ox has its lush pasture,\nWhy should I weigh its worth?\nThe world knows not my heart,\nWhy mourn my voice?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of the Orchid Sash\"**\n\nThe orchid’s fragrance,\nIts essence pure and clear.\nI would wear it,\nWho sees my thoughts?\nNear or far,\nFrost and snow cannot rend it.\nOn land near at hand,\nOnly brambles and thorns thrive.\nI plant it in seclusion,\nGrieving its hidden bloom.\nHidden, oh hidden,\nDo not lift your fragrance,\nDo not display your beauty.\n\n---\n\n**Imitating \"The Spirit’s Release\"**\n\nThe heavens’ edge is distant and hard to fathom,\nMyriad things surge in endless flux.\nThe supreme principle melts into the great wheel,\nOne root branches into all creation.\nThe empty and numinous governs the subtle pivot,\nThe dark mechanism turns in nurturing poison.\nWaxing and waning alternate in ceaseless play,\nThe mysterious and vast embraces all beings.\nLuminous and clear, spanning the first beginning,\nHow can dust and defilement be bound?\nLife and death are not two paths,\nShort and long are but fleeting constraints.\nThe ancient immortals Pine and Paulownia,\nRode their steeds in carefree roaming.\nI long to follow them,\nYet my lonely flight lags far behind,\nBound to the dusty altar.\nHow can I shed its filth,\nMolding my form like a cicada’s molt?\nDrowning in the foam, I yet lead my kind,\nGazing afar, I dwell in the six bones.\nWhat use are excrescences,\nWhen the hidden truth knows no bounds?\nThe abyss is clear, desireless,\nWho says it is blind to joy or fear?\nDay and night, I am ever buffeted,\nVast and empty beyond heaven and earth,\nMy breath like a flickering candle.\nA thousand ages cast their lingering light,\nThe supreme spirit shines forever bright.\n\n---\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nAlas, within the vault of heaven and earth,\nA single breath swells in boundless might.\nThe cosmos fills the eight directions,\nThe empty and numinous abides in true awakening.\nEphemeral splendor gathers like moths,\nRebellious strife races like crocodiles.\nContending in clamor, trampling one another,\nHow can one attain the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui?\nFrozen like ice, wary as treading frost,\nBlazing like flames, startled by kindling.\nWho grasps the balance of fate’s subtle workings?\nI drift in tranquil detachment.\nWhen sincerity and the Dao penetrate the first beginning,\nHow can the subtle and distant be fathomed?\n\nThe autumn sky stretches deep as a profound abyss,\nThe clearing moon gleams in the hidden ravine.\nThrough a thousand ages, what could compare?\nIn tranquil emptiness, I guard the serene void.\n\nCold and heat alternate in ceaseless succession,\nPast and present ever shift and replace.\nVigorous movement turns without pause,\nRound and square settle high and low.\nRain and dew—what is not instruction?\nWind and thunder complete the work of creation.\nThe supreme principle governs the dark mechanism,\nShaping and nurturing with measured art.\n\nGreat indeed is the embodiment of sincerity and clarity,\nCultivating and refining to weave purity.\nTo establish destiny is to build the foundation,\nFollowing the model provides ample support.\nWhy let adornment stray from truth,\nOr flaws and blights lack tempering and forging?\nThe banks of the Qi lie silent, their echoes faint,\nThe profound workings drift in sorrowful grace.\n\nConfucius and Mozi walked distinct paths,\nMencius pursued a different noble labor.\nThrough perilous passes to Wei and Lu they ventured,\nYet who ultimately followed the kingly Way?\nChunyu’s will remained unbowed,\nGongsun Long claimed the firm and white.\nThe odes of Qi resounded with vigor,\nWhile Yang Xiong lamented the *Beautiful New*.\nLaozi’s dark words grew obscure,\nGuan Yin knew the pursuit of the mean.\nZhuangzi and Liezi stood as strange masters,\nThe *Pian Dao* school taught emptiness.\nTheir doctrines arose amid Zhou’s decline,\nYet how far could their wild defenses go?\nIf the times favor not the good,\nDetachment leads to nothingness.\n\nThe supreme Dao wondrously embraces the Three Ultimates,\nHuman culture reveals the imperial heart.\nBenevolence and righteousness are heaven’s nature,\nEndowment of essence—why confusion or delusion?\nTo master reverence is to achieve purity,\nIn conduct, guard the self with care.\nThe mean and harmony govern the balance,\nGeneration and growth reside in the spirit’s work.\nDrill and contemplate to grasp the thread,\nIn subtlety and peril, be steadfast and reverent.\nBeware the boastful and obsequious,\nWho miss the wind of Lian and Luo.\nIn secluded integrity, I hold distant longing,\nYet where shall the crooked and devious turn?\n\nJoy in the dwelling of fish and birds,\nHarmony in the following of springs and stones.\nThe vast tune of high antiquity,\nSilent and profound, returns to Fuxi and Nong.\nEmbracing truth, I awaken to suspended liberation,\nIn *equalizing things*, I probe my own mystery.\nThe crescent moon foretells the hidden depths,\nThe compass’s center aligns with the profound abyss.\nVacuity and clarity share the pivot,\nWondrous union intertwines in distant revolution.\nYang fire overflows the true season,\nYin ice melts the cold spring.\nThe yellow center turns the chariot’s track,\nA single breath completes the celestial cycle.\nJade liquid nurtures the spirit root,\nJasper radiance blooms in the field of mushrooms.\nDivine transformation defies verbal measure,\nIts signs vast as the dark expanse.\n\nLong have I tasted the secrets of the mysterious mandate,\nRiding the wind to summon the immortal Gu Quan.\nSupreme harmony lies in preserving union,\nGuiding the reins to soar on high.\nSitting in forgetfulness, the swallow rests at ease,\nWhile the shallow world entangles in frantic pursuit.\nIf one truly understands the principle of life,\nThe nature and destiny of things become utterly clear.\nNo need to wield the blade in idle play,\nThe sacrificial ox trusts the celestial whetstone.\nFortune and misfortune intertwine,\nExistence and decay must be self-evident.\nExcrescences are but clods of earth,\nHow can the fox’s eloquence be trusted?\nShen Gong turned back his chariot,\nYuan Gu pressed on to the end.\nChaoxu and Xu You shamed the pure stream,\nShu Shi was called a worthy minister.\nI sing the song of gathering lingzhi,\nNo longer ensnared by cherry or netting.\nTo leap forward as the lame turtle,\nHonor and disgrace—what cause for alarm?\nThose who steal names are base as Tian and Shi,\nWhat sorrow in their brewing and acceptance?\nThe beauty of a man lies in his birds and calves,\nThe jian bird is not in Cao’s peril.\nConfucius returned, lowing like a calf,\nDuke Yu departed in wonder.\nXi Fu was no mere reed,\nSai Shu’s *qilin* was in vain.\nTo sharpen oneself is to summon the distant wind,\nThrough a thousand ages, all return to the same beauty.\n\nAlas, Wei Zhuangzi,\nWhy sigh alone?\nGathering feng grass, I walk and sing,\nForever bound for the mountain forest’s retreat.\n\nHeaven and earth are but forms and vessels,\nYin and yang wield their gathering and chaos.\nThe myriad breaths surge in tangled motion,\nHandle and socket—how could they meet by chance?\nDregs and chaff sink in delusion,\nThe colt’s snatching—what equality is there?\nThe plain path values steadfast integrity,\nHolding the pattern, one sees the center’s design.\nQue and Jie relied on plowing’s bounty,\nLian and Huan kept their purity and grace.\nXian Zhang declined the fish-drawn carriage,\nChen Yu severed the sheep’s trail.\nThe inch-long worm transforms to blue and yellow,\nSlander and praise—beware the wooden duke.\nThe *Wei Feng* laments the *Cypress Boat*,\nThe river’s flow—how swiftly it passes.\nLin Lei stood silent,\nGathering orchids, he sang in the hidden thicket.\n\nThe morning sun rises on the eastern trees,\nThe faint moon drifts over the western peak.\nThe Milky Way’s rushing rapids draw near,\nThe flocking birds join in song.\nSpring and summer’s climates differ,\nCold and heat each follow their course.\nI long for distant companionship,\nThis man’s orchid lapel is fragrant.\nFar removed from the world’s dust,\nOnly the faint echo of jade’s music remains.\nWhy speak of lofty aspirations?\nMy feelings stir as I hand over my hairpin.\n\nThe numinous shade dims the sun’s brilliance,\nA pure breeze enters the bed’s curtains.\nThe swallows nest in their old eaves,\nThe shore’s geese take flight on high.\nThe courtyard trees flourish in southern glory,\nThe river’s flow hastens eastward.\nBramble and thorn choke the road,\nHesitating, where shall I go?\nAscend that lofty mound,\nWhere mugwort and artemisia spread in profusion.\nGo, go—speak no more,\nFor black dust easily soils the robe.\n\nThe distant eastern mountains stretch on,\nWinding northwest through orchid groves.\nWhere do I fasten my girdle’s jade?\nThe fierce wind blows the evening chill.\nFrozen mists congeal in the day’s cold,\nFrost and dew make the journey harder.\nI grieve for this fragrant essence,\nLest it be marred by weeds and decay.\nThe spring’s flow sobs in sorrow,\nThe dark cicada wails in the empty hills.\nThe hidden lingzhi—vainly I seek to pluck it,\nHow can I alone find peace?\n\nThe eastern mountain stands high and level,\nThe stream’s current runs deep and swift.\nSoaring birds take flight on high,\nFloating clouds gather in layered shade.\nSpring’s fragrance thrives in a hundred blossoms,\nA mournful wind sways the sunlit grove.\nFlourishing and withering—like morning and dusk,\nIn old age, I vainly lament.\nWhy scheme for wealth and rank?\nThe empty window shames a thousand gold.\nThe purple mushrooms of Shangshan bloom,\nYet what heart did Yuan and Qi truly hold?\n\nDriving the chariot from the western city,\nThe outskirts teem with fragrant trees.\nMisty drizzle dampens my timid robes,\nThick shade veils the courtyard gate.\nThe cold sun sinks into the long river,\nThe southern road stretches far.\nLong have I been parted from my home,\nStep by step, I turn to look back.\nWithin a hundred years of life,\nHow many times does fear and dread arise?\nThe bright moon shines on the lofty ridge,\nThe stars number but four or five.\nI gaze in melancholy—where to go?\nThe autumn wind’s song at dusk.\n\nWinter’s chill arrives,\nThe north wind blows through the poplar garden.\nFalling leaves cry the autumn’s voice,\nThe evening light shines on the western pavilion.\nI know not that the night is not yet spent,\nThe stars’ radiance gleams and multiplies.\nFeeding the horse, I cross the solid ice,\nThe traveler sighs at the road’s difficulty.\nI ponder my lifelong aspirations,\nHard to express in following footsteps.\nThe ice strings draw forth wondrous notes,\nTheir lingering echoes drift among the clouds.\nI lift my head in thought through the ages,\nThe flickering candle faces another year’s cold.\n\nIn the northeast stands a fine tree,\nAt dusk, the faint wind chills.\n\nThe rains linger on the road for years,\nFloating mists still soar and scatter.\nThe evening sun descends the western ridge,\nIts lingering glow illumines the secluded chamber.\nWhite dew overflows the steps,\nThe Milky Way dips low, then rises high.\nI throw on my robe and rise to pace,\nWhy so much inward sorrow?\nI fear only that my aspirations will be thwarted,\nGrasping my hair—I see it swiftly turn gray.\n\n**Intending to Roam as an Immortal**\nNorth of the verdant mountains grow the magic mushrooms,\nOn the lofty ridge stand trees of splendor.\nTheir fragrant petals gleam morning and evening,\nBranches and leaves flourish on their own.\nI long to soar with feathered pendants through the heavens,\nTo transcend the world in lofty reclusion.\nI lift my traces beyond the azure stream,\nGaze afar at the oranges by the limpid pool.\nOnce, Master Fuqiu built his hut,\nForever chanting, he rode the light gale.\nWith towering vision, he spied the steep isles,\nSoaring and wheeling through the circling winds.\nFar-reaching, he roamed the six directions,\nScorning the arts of Xu You and Han Kang.\nSinging boldly, he followed the luminous tracks,\nSerene, he rested in the hidden depths.\nHearing the clamor of the profit-seeking world,\nI hide in the mountains, far from the crowd.\nWhy strive for a carriage and four?\nWhat need to return to my lotus hut?\nI climb the forest-clad ridges,\nGrasp the marsh grass and gaze over the clear stream.\nThe layered peaks invite lingering,\nHow could I again don the long robe of office?\nOn Mount Kongtong, the hidden pillar-scribe,\nIn the gardens of Zheng, one leaps in reclusion.\nWhen understanding dawns, the great bird takes flight,\nWhen transcendent power surges, the deep fish soars.\nDwelling unseen beyond mist and clouds,\nI chant aloud, gazing toward the primal beginning.\nA numinous peak towers ten thousand fathoms high,\nWithin it dwells a student of immortality.\nMist congeals on the cliffs and valleys,\nClouds veil the springs and dust.\nWho can fathom what manner of man he is?\nI hear he is Ge Hong.\nHe lifts his traces toward Luofu,\nThe elixir of immortality grants long vision.\nHis chariot and canopy turn northward,\nIn the forest of pearls, he awaits the phoenix’s tread.\nThe Jade Maiden has departed—shall I follow?\nCold and light, I spread my wings.\nQu Yuan’s lament finds no path,\nWhy gaze ahead, awaiting what?\n\n**Intending to Summon the Recluse**\nI pace the layered heights, grasping the handle of reclusion,\nTreading the secluded path through winding turns.\nThe forest’s shelter is no mere construction,\nThorns and brambles fill the desolate corner.\nOrchids grace the lofty marsh,\nTheir lingering fragrance veils the encircling home.\nDistant peaks stand jagged and steep,\nTowering trees rise in solemn majesty.\nHere, one relies on plowing and herding,\nThe fields and acres already store their harvest.\nWhy then be bound by worldly ties?\nThe steep valleys are my joy.\nIn Shangluo, I secretly tend my garden,\nOn the high mound, I rest with Chang Ju.\nWhy linger in hesitation?\nTruly, I long to sing with Jie Yu.\nI recline in the heart of the forest,\nAs the last rays of the setting sun spread their glory below.\nBelow lies a winding clear pool,\nEnough to wash the dust from my cap-strings.\nAmid the deep green and dense growth,\nPines and cassia stand firm and steadfast.\nThickets and thickets of mugwort and wormwood,\nCold springs gleam in solitary clarity.\nFew can wear both sash and virtue,\nYet retreat and solitude may be embraced alone.\nCarrying my basket, I tread the wild path,\nLike Chao Fu and Xu You, free from entanglements.\nThe perfected one does not climb the former slope,\nThe great transformation rides this course.\nI gaze in melancholy—with whom shall I find accord?\nHesitant, I clasp my lingering fragrance.\nMy long-held admiration finds no match,\nPacing the courtyard, I stand in vain.\nWhom shall I follow in my wandering?\nThat man sleeps among the reeds.\nAt dawn, I climb the western ridge,\nAt dusk, I return to the eastern marsh.\nThe lofty ridge stands like a towering screen,\nLush trees flourish in dense array.\nI yearn for Yue, sighing at the wind in the bamboo,\nLonging for Yang, lamenting the dew-laden blossoms.\nWhy do the trees of the forest stand in vain?\nFloating clouds veil the layered peaks.\nEmpty nests cling to slender branches,\nThe numinous shade shelters the secluded dwelling.\nMy clumsiness needs no waiting,\nI long only to rest in the vaulted canopy.\nShunning profit, my feet stand firm,\nWhere shall I raise my sleeves and settle?\n\n**Intending to Present My Form to My Shadow**\nAll things share a single root,\nFullness and emptiness are their constant.\nHeaven and earth are also forms and vessels,\nTheir flowing movement relies on soft and hard.\nVigorous and yielding ever unceasing,\nWhy grieve within the Great Harmony?\nThis floating life is but an illusion,\nYet the numinous light reveals good and ill.\nSuccess and failure are but fleeting shadows,\nAspirations thwarted, hard to align.\nChasing and racing in defilement,\nDrowning brings calamity upon oneself.\nLet your inner light shine, steadfast and bright,\nTrue virtue knows no bounds.\nAt dusk, be vigilant in your steps,\nStraying brings frost and ice.\nI wish to gird myself with these words,\nHoping thereby to strengthen myself.\n\n**Intending My Shadow to Answer My Form**\nOur traces are both like morning dew,\nWalking this form, we prize likeness.\nHeaven and earth are a vast loom,\nYin and yang—how can we fathom their workings?\nThe ten thousand beings weave in profusion,\nChasing and racing in clamor and glare.\nDarkness daily deepens the obscurity,\nSinking and drowning in filth.\nAbandoning purity for stench and impurity,\nHow can we return to the bright illumination?\nAh, the sagely and wise,\nTheir admonitions are vast and essential.\nTreading the furrowed path is like walking on ice,\nReverent care alone brings flourishing.\nBe sincere in cultivating yourself,\nLest you fall into the scorn of a hundred years.\nThe great transformation shares a single return,\nIn clarity and emptiness, behold the wondrous.\n\n**Intending an Ancient Theme**\nTo nurture the heart is to see Heaven’s principle,\nMovement and stillness cycle without end.\nRightness and destiny are fundamentally one,\nThe celestial endowment is deeply hidden.\nThe august words of the sages,\nI take to heart with my very lungs and liver.\nTo fulfill one’s nature is to hold fast,\nTo preserve it is no arduous task.\nThe subtle and minute lie in focusing the One,\nAbiding in reverence turns back the rushing torrent.\nSwift birds must curb desire,\nHeat and cold arise from agitation and stillness.\nHeaven’s vigor should be unceasing,\nThe mechanism of transformation moves in cycles.\nSincerity in oneself establishes the ultimate,\nReturning to unity is no hard thing.\nAlas, those who draw distinctions,\nSighing at the darkness beyond their ken.\nThey grasp the moon like the historian of Jin,\nOr shrink like the cicada of Qin and Zhao.\nIn silence, I renounce the vain pursuit,\nMy indignation and pacing deepen my sighs.\nHow could the great and noble,\nFrom ancient times, harbor such sorrow?\nI look up, yearning for the ancients,\nTo fathom the divine is the grand vision.\n\n**Miscellaneous Poems**\nMorning shadows gather the sun’s radiance,\nWind and rain come from the northern grove.\nThe seasons shift, the creatures change,\nThe rows of trees deepen their shade.\nI recline in the quiet of the courtyard,\nThe garden birds pour forth their sweet songs.\nI look up, cherishing the ancients,\nSitting cross-legged, embracing emptiness.\nI admire Yuan Xian’s lofty path,\nWhile Zigong laments poverty’s encroachment.\nIn the numinous realm, I rest in tranquil illumination,\nHiding my depths, I take up the task myself.\nLofty feelings align with reclusive ideals,\nMy solitary sighs scatter my serene heart.\nDragging my sandals, I sing of *Shu Li*,\nMy distant traces remain among rivers and peaks.\nThe dawn stars gleam with lingering light,\nThe full sun beautifies the graceful trees.\nUntil daybreak, the shadows hum softly,\nClear frost weighs on the clustered chrysanthemums.\nBy the shore, wild geese call in flight,\nReeds on the islet veil their lush green.\nThe beauty lies beyond the autumn waters,\nHer graceful traces beyond the steep valley.\nThe ways of kings and hegemons fade into antiquity,\nLike Yuan An’s noble and fragrant steps.\nAs the year wanes, I long to follow,\nI prepare my carriage, lingering in hesitation.\nWinding through the morning sun’s glow,\nSuddenly, I am deep in the forest’s curve.\nDawn and dusk bring shifting weather,\nThe garden and grove scatter their lingering cool.\n\nFalling blossoms drift in the fading light,\nAs dusk approaches, dragonflies hum low.\nEarly summer’s heat has not yet burned,\nFragrant grasses intertwine by the pool’s edge.\n\nWeary, I rest beneath the pale moon’s glow,\nWhile frozen gusts brim with white dew.\nI linger in admiration of Zhou Xie,\nAnd lie in repose, cherishing Guan Ning’s ways.\n\nLofty vision grieves the illusory flux,\nYet concealment or display rests in man’s greatness.\nMy heart delights in the call of springs and stones,\nDiscarding sandals, I sever all floating entanglements.\n\nIn early summer, chilling winds still blow,\nScorching heat has not yet come full circle.\nFragrant trees spread their leaves like clouds,\nMorning birds clamor, seeking one another.\n\nHidden blossoms adorn thickets and groves,\nPathside grasses grow soft and lush.\nAs the sun sets, I rejoice in finding refuge,\nWhere thorns and brambles veil the lofty hills.\n\nLife passes swift as a galloping steed,\nAll attachments are but fleeting shadows.\nFeeding taro to delude the troop of monkeys,\nI cast off the body—what fault is there?\n\nPursuing the Dao is like brewing wine in a gourd,\nWhy should I harbor cares for a hundred generations?\nBorn with no intent to engage the world,\nThe ways of the vulgar are not mine to know.\n\nThis body, illusory as morning dew,\nYet joy unfolds with each dawn’s light.\nBeholding heaven and earth in their vastness,\nI see all as a single swirl of gathering and scattering.\n\nEmbracing poverty, I sense wealth’s toil,\nHolding to lowliness, I forget rank’s peril.\nBan Biao cherished antiquity,\nZhou Dang’s integrity was rare and strange.\n\nDiscarding strife, I shed sharp contention,\nFortune and misfortune are not mine to bequeath.\nIf the world lacks men like Qian Lou,\nTo whom shall I speak these words?\n\nIn bitter winter, motion never ceases,\nThe four wilds lie beneath layered gloom.\nAt dusk, floating clouds race,\nSorrowful winds stir the sparse woods.\n\nPerched birds call from familiar branches,\nYearning for spring, I utter a hidden chant.\nMy carriage, greased, stumbles on past tracks,\nMy wings, once spread, now seldom sound in flight.\n\nFar off, I entrust myself to the secret summons of the profound,\nRoaming freely, I renounce the dusty hairpin.\nLight and shadow dart like lightning,\nHow can I ever align with the bamboo’s steadfast heart?\n\nGazing afar, I rest upon the sunlit ridge,\nA lone soaring bird vanishes beyond the towering peaks.\nBeholding the boundless transformations of the myriad things,\nWho could suffice to anchor my heart?\n\nSuddenly, the morning air softens,\nClear and bright, unobscured by haze.\nMy gaze flows beyond the eight horizons,\nNurturing the sprouts of all creation.\n\nSweet rain murmurs at the eaves,\nSpring’s warmth suffuses all with gentle radiance.\nMorning winds stir the lofty groves,\nThe vast river flows on, boundless.\n\nI recline among my books,\nEmptying my mind to follow the ancients’ intent.\nThe dust’s fetters still my swift flight,\nPassions’ grime cools its burning heat.\n\nWhy seek Pang Meng’s summons,\nOr pledge myself to Xue Fang’s pact?\nI lament those who chase after trivial ends,\nAs the vast heavens reveal the Emperor of Images.\n\n---\n\n**Autumn Meditations**\n\nFierce winds roar through the towering trees,\nI stand dismayed, knowing autumn has come.\nMorning light transforms valleys and streams,\nDay and night, clouds drift across the sky.\n\nProlonged rains dissolve the scorching season,\nDense shade hastens the cicadas’ urgent cries.\nI linger, moved by the passing of time,\nParting my robe, I cling to solitude.\n\nFleeting lives are like gnats and mosquitoes,\nTheir breaths and chirps all alike.\nI sigh with Yin Xi’s lament,\nAnd long for Hong Yao’s companionship.\n\nWandering, I entrust myself to the central grove,\nYet where are the steadfast and few?\nGreed and strife vie for hooks and bait,\nHow can one ever be free?\n\nThe dark sage wished to remain silent,\nWho will understand my sorrow?\nBitter rains swell the cold pools,\nThe sorrowful terrace wails through the night.\n\nMournful crickets echo through courtyard and door,\nWild islets lie beneath drifting mist.\nGrasses and trees grow ever more sere,\nStriking my breast, a thousand cares arise.\n\nThe bright lamp stirs the bed and zither,\nYet tuning their notes yields no true sound.\nFar distant are the transformations of the Yellow Emperor’s age,\nWhile petty men’s resentments swell within.\n\nGloom spreads its excesses,\nThe altar of Kan rises and falls with dawn and dusk.\nThrough the night, I lie awake, restless,\nVainly nursing regrets and remorse.\n\nSince ancient times, sinking and rising have been our lot,\nExhausted, how can we journey far?\nGazing broadly, all is but a fleeting instant,\nFor now, I release my lingering emotions.\n\nGlowing clouds gather at dusk,\nAutumn’s air grows ever more desolate.\nFrost and dew turn increasingly bitter,\nCrickets sing through the cold night.\n\nMorning mist veils the vaulted woods,\nSoaring birds rest in hidden marshes.\nMy bearing, once graceful, now frail,\nI am moved to sorrow and lament.\n\nThe vulgar vie to be caught in nets,\nFew follow the ancient ways’ guiding line.\nDark vapors shroud the crossroads,\nThe restless trample through brambles and thickets.\n\nSong Yu lamented the sorrowful wind,\nThe divine ruler gazed up to the steadfast model.\nI feast on clouded wine and fallen blossoms,\nAnd aspire to surpassing virtue, driving my chariot beyond.\n\nNine cups steeped with orchid’s fragrance,\nThe withering groves’ chrysanthemums turn pale.\nFor now, I follow the path of tranquil ease,\nWho can bear the world’s reproach?\n\nThe crimson sun purifies its scorching might,\nThe autumn season shifts to metal’s purity.\nMorning groves stir with swift winds,\nCourtyard grasses brim with white dew.\n\nFalling leaves drift in the faint sunlight,\nGrasshoppers sing near the door.\nWaves flow across the level river,\nI see mandarin ducks calling by the shore.\n\nIn seclusion, I speak of late autumn,\nThe seasons’ sequence—when will it pause?\nA thousand ancient thoughts weigh upon the eaves,\nLofty aspirations stretch far into the distance.\n\nVainly, I feel the sorrow of Hui Lian,\nHow could I yearn for An Ren’s admiration?\nI turn the reins toward the swan’s high carriage,\nAnd cast my cap into the river’s flow.\n\nDelighting in the joys of hills and gardens,\nI gaze up and down, relying on hidden contemplation.\nDismayed by the woodcutter’s fading traces,\nI sing a vast song upon the desert road.\n\nEmbracing my clumsiness, I find harmony beyond the groves,\nNurturing my spirit, all cares

early.\nI read not for official rank,\nBut wander the hills with staff in hand.\nI chose this wild land to build my home,\nWhere woods and waters stretch in ease.\nA stone bridge spans the empty ravine,\nEvening mists nourish the lofty peaks.\nDelighting in plowing and fishing,\nI decline all offers, content in retreat.\nOld friendships have long faded,\nMy talents seek no external use.\nThe

goodness—\nFrom now on, I await the years’ endurance.\n\n**Evening Thoughts in a Mountain Dwelling**\n\nA lone pine stands in the twilight valley,\nAutumn thoughts fill the hills.\nHere, among pines and cassia, I find my place,\nWeary wings know when to return.\nThe autumn wind grows sharp and cold,\nThe pond’s ripples chime like jade rings.\nFallen leaves adorn the sunny ridge,\nThe thorn gate is draped in meadow orchids.\nI rise to open the window, setting my scattered thoughts in order,\nDistant chimes fade into the evening air.\nEvening dew dampens the clustered chrysanthemums,\nI crouch, my joy diminished.\nTroubles and blessings, faults and fortunes pass—\nIn obscurity, there is no blame or hardship.\nVirtue shines brightest in harmony,\nTurning inward, I find inner peace.\nUnderstanding heaven, I have long grasped fate,\nFinding joy where I rest, content in my place.\nThe great transformation is but a bubble’s pivot,\nThe cosmos vast as a floating gourd.\nClear

cares lost in hidden depths.\n\n**Winter in a Mountain Dwelling**\n\nI follow my plain calling with steadfast resolve,\nMy lofty spirit unconfined by the world’s cage.\nA trickling stream echoes on the distant path,\nI lean on my staff and return to the secluded valley.\nWild sparrows chirp at the daytime door,\nThe square pond brims with cold green.\nSwift winds scatter the clear air,\nFrosted leaves glide through the forest’s curves.\nI touch my heart, my resolve shaken,\nMy feelings bound by the world’s net.\nYet my humble gate offers enough for rest—\nWhy should I envy the crane or the woodpecker’s perch?\nLong have I relied on Sun Deng’s wisdom,\nWhy trouble Ji Zhu with divination?\nI entrust my remaining years to nurturing truth,\nWho can sway my desires with fate’s decree?\nMy lineage is bound to heaven’s order,\nYet I grieve for the lost, stumbling in sorrow.\nIn earnestness, I shame my shortcomings,\nIn cultivating virtue, I ponder emptiness.\nWith clear vision, I yield to the flowing stream,\nDiscarding worldly burdens and needless haste.\nWhat I mourn is my unfulfilled longing,\nIts echoes lost in the distant hubbub.\nThick mists veil the distant peaks,\nThe clear sky gleams with frost and moon.\nCold streams chime like jade pendants,\nDew falls as the stars align.\nThe high pavilion congeals in mist,\nA biting wind cuts through the cold.\nTurning inward, I stand firm in fate,\nDwelling in patience, my resolve unwavering.\nThe yellow bird rests in the hill’s corner,\nIts haste and stumbles born of worldly dust.\nIn vain, the eloquent wander the empty valleys,\nTheir dark mysteries long cherished.\nHow could I blindly follow the vulgar chase,\nWhere gain and loss break the steadfast spirit?\nThe enlightened find joy in heaven’s will—\nWhat need have they to witness the vast emptiness?\nIn perfect harmony, the primal oneness is revealed,\nWashing away my hidden frustrations.\nFor now, I delight in the plum and bamboo’s fragrance,\nAs the year ends beyond the ice and snow.\nBasking in the warmth of the southern eaves,\nThe morning sun warms my humble home.\nDripping dew chimes in the clustered bamboo,\nIce creeps through the forest streams.\nThe winter plum blooms amid the snow,\nThe grasses bend with the wind.\nThe four seasons turn in their cycles,\nThe new sun dawns in the boundless sky.\nLayered peaks are veiled in thin mist,\nThe murmuring stream soothes my ears.\nReclining in the clouds and waters’ quiet,\nIn clarity and emptiness, I find my rest.\nWho in this world is not bound to fate?\nTo fulfill one’s nature lies within oneself.\nI lament past faults, yet embrace obscurity,\nChastening my beginnings to walk with care.\nHow could I fathom the workings of the primal mechanism?\nI follow the ancient path, looking to those who came before.\nRaising my head, I sigh to the azure heavens—\nTo whom could I speak of gathering herbs?\nMy dull and stubborn nature,\nI leave behind in these hills and vales.\n\n**A Small Drink in the Mountains, Presented to the Two Recluses Wang and Ji**\n\nThe first sun warms the dawn after rain,\nIn quiet delight, we meet by chance.\nThe humble cottage basks in morning light,\nForest and stream abound in clarity and space.\n\nBy chance we prolong the joy of clouds and waters,\nWho would call this gourd-dwelling narrow?\nLong have I cast off the dusty world’s passions,\nBirds and fish now greet me with ease.\n\nEmptiness and tranquility move with the Dao,\nDetachment only deepens heaven’s freedom.\nI see clearly how phoenix and roc pursue their paths,\nWhile others drown in the dusty net of day and night.\n\nI sigh in admiration for Zheng and Li’s summons—\nHow could I be swept away by drifting waves?\nAshamed of my dull and waning faculties,\nI retreat in stillness to the brambles and wilds.\n\nWhat fortune to join such venerable elders,\nOur bold songs stirring the crisp autumn air.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nFine rain gathers on the lofty hills,\nI turn homeward to the white-clouded peaks.\nEntangled in worldly cares, my thoughts drift,\nYet in the heart of the forest, I find contentment.\n\nWater and trees lend their quiet ease,\nThe fragrance of spring deepens my intent.\nLeaping fish dance in round bubbles,\nJoyful birds sing in the shaded groves.\n\nNear the ravine, the stream begins to swell,\nFalling blossoms encroach on the overgrown path.\nAshamed I lack foresight,\nMy heart remains empty, my thoughts serene.\n\nHeaven’s Dao moves in silence,\nSincerity alone resides in the plain heart.\nVigilant cultivation brooks no delay—\nWho else shall bear this resolve?\n\n---\n\n**Water Pavilion, Dispelling Care**\n\nA chance meeting lifts distant aspirations,\nIn seclusion, no worldly

its first sheath,\nWildflowers scatter their last petals.\n\nFields and valleys deepen in summer green,\nAs time passes, worldly cares accumulate.\nThe dark and undivided hold to fate’s decree,\nI briefly share the gulls’ and egrets’ pact.\n\n---\n\n**Night Lodging in the Eastern Garden of Yousheng Abbey, Hangzhou**\n\nIn youth, my ambitions spanned seas and mountains,\nBefore manhood, I studied poetry and books.\nDeeply I admired the traces of mountain recluses,\nAt peace with the world’s contrary ways.\n\nOnce I wandered freely in Qiantang,\nNow I rest in this garden cottage.\nOld friends once shared close ties,\nNew acquaintances bring cautious joy.\n\nI recline in the shade of green paulownia,\nSinging aloud the Yellow Oriole’s song.\nBamboo by the window parts the first rain,\nMoonlight spills across the front steps.\n\nOranges swell with frost’s roundness,\nReeds stretch across the vast lake.\nFriends gather like cranes in a flock,\nMy idle heart aligns with lofty principles.\n\nAt the first word of parting,\nMy heart and steps grow distant.\nThe sunbird cries in the mournful wind,\nCold tides descend on the withered plain.\n\nFive years pass in fleeting moments,\nReflecting, I linger in hesitation.\nSeated, I feel the weight of time’s decay—\nWhy cling to the immortals’ constraints?\n\nAt dawn, I rouse my distant longing,\nResolved to return to my fields and garden.\nThe sound of Wang Qiao’s reed pipes and cranes\nSoars alone into the void.\n\n---\n\n**Basking in the Sun**\n\nI love the sun’s gentle warmth,\nThin clouds slowly disperse.\nThe barren mountains gather cold shadows,\nCourtyard trees stand sparse and withered.\n\nThe lowlands still lie submerged,\nYet the fields offer humble refuge.\nMillet and wheat fill the furrows,\nBut the harvest leaves many granaries bare.\n\nWhat can I do to set things right?\nThe world’s ways diverge from my path.\nHow could I know the joy of warmth,\nStill reaching the scattered and the frail?\n\nHeavy frost withers the hundred grasses,\nHidden blossoms mingle along the garden path.\nWhat offering could I make to you?\nOnly to clear the overgrowth within.\n\nThe vast spirit of high antiquity lingers,\nIts depths suffice for endless contemplation.\nI cast myself into the quiet shore,\nContent with this life’s measure.\n\nSurrounded by walls overgrown with brambles,\nCool shade covers the garden’s green.\nI endure the wind and rain’s assault,\nNever clashing with the world’s currents.\n\nFew visitors disturb my carriage’s wheels,\nFew thoughts bind my heart.\nI eat simple fare, seeking no excess,\nWearing worn clothes, sitting in meditation.\n\nYet old habits breed dust and obstruction,\nIllusions steep me in their warmth.\nIf I do not cherish what lies before me,\nFleeting distractions will chase one another.\n\nWho has plumbed the harmony of heaven and earth?\nMind and world await restoration.\nGreat indeed is the trigram *Gen*’s beginning and end,\nIts noble fruit joining the mountain’s trees.\n\n---\n\n**Gazing Over the Wilds**\n\nThe north wind whips the raging waves,\nThe river runs turbid, unclarified.\nOxen and dogs traverse the level

through the night.\n\nMy worn clothes weary of travel,\nThe lingering rain brings the cold.\nWorldly moods shift between dawn and dusk,\nThis fleeting form—what shall it meet?\n\nThe reeds and mallows whisper mournfully,\nI can only sigh and clutch my breast.\nWhen the sky clears and the wind stills,\nMorning clouds drift past the distant geese.\n\nRiver grasses glimmer in faint sunlight,\nReed isles scatter wandering tracks.\nTurning homeward, my heart eases,\nWeary, I rest among the mugwort and thistles.\n\nMy form dwells within this bounded world,\nThis floating life follows nature’s end.\nSuccess or failure—why dwell on them?\nA hundred sorrows only vex the heart.\n\nHold to sincerity, return to nature,\nCultivate yourself in timely balance.\nWhen shall I cast off my clumsiness,\nForever trusting in the wind of Chao and Xu?\n\n---\n\n**Lodging at Qingyuan Abbey, Former Residence of the Immortal Ge**\n\nThe Dao’s pattern moves in subtle ways,\nThe perfected one hides his sacred traces.\nThis lofty structure stands in a famed town,\nOnce I wandered here, moved to the depths.\n\nFar from the dust of winding lanes,\nA winding path circles the crumbling pond.\nPond grasses thrive in evening dew,\nThe light pavilion echoes with tall pines.\n\nThe hall’s hempen curtains frame the vaulted image,\nIts splendor faded, I sigh for the remnants.\nMysterious threads follow the steps of practice,\nThe well’s turtle and the western beam endure.\n\nA separate chamber invites a shared drink,\nLamps flicker as the room stirs.\nThrough the night, my thoughts grow still,\nLooking up, I lament the lost legacy.\n\nAt dawn, I set out to explore,\nCautioning myself to diligent cultivation.\nThe divine work is not remote—\nThrough the ages, it illumines the dark.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Journey on the Second Day of the Third Month, Jiaxu**\n\nRain clears from the front peaks,\nI urge my staff along the homeward path.\nOvergrown trails wind through spring grasses,\nWild waters cross the level bridge.\n\nJoyful birds sing in round, clear tones,\nPlowing oxen tread with measured steps.\nAbundant springs murmur in shaded ravines,\nDense bamboo gleams in the inner garden.\n\nThe sacred peak opens to an airy pavilion,\nThorn gates guard the cloud-bound fastness.\nNew streams overflow the pond,\nLush greenery fills the windows.\n\nI sweep the terrace, arrange the scattered books,\nLeaning on my staff, I gaze through the brambles.\nHills and groves suit my delight,\nHow could I vainly admire the world’s filth?\n\nIn emptiness and detachment, I praise distant traces,\nYet perilous affairs caution my hidden tasks.\nHow could I sever worldly ties?\nOnly among trees and stones can I find deep refuge.\n\nWeary wings rest in the branch’s nest,\nThe lost may yet awaken to my understanding.\nFor now, I indulge my reclusive heart,\nLife’s meaning lies in the farmer’s plot.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Former Site of Lord Wen’an’s Xiangshan Shrine**\n\nFu Xi and Yao embodied heaven’s movement,\nThe kingly Dao upheld the web of human relations.\nShun and Yu inherited the sacred vessel,\nTheir single-mindedness shone in transmission.\n\n**Ascending the Former Site of Lord Wen’an’s Xiangshan Shrine (continued)**\n\nWhen Zhou fell, the *Ya* and *Song* odes faded,\nConfucius spoke in alarm.\nYi Yin aided the mandate’s reception,\nWhile Mencius upheld its propagation.\nGreat was this profound canon’s mystery,\nIts radiance shining through a hundred generations.\nYet through decline and renewal it passed,\nBrightness and obscurity defying heaven’s constancy.\n\nThe Lu-Wang school revived the hidden lineage,\n*Jianzhong* continued the ways of Yu and Tang.\nLike uncut jade from Qingtian and Jingshan,\nIts vast renown gleamed pure and bright.\nThe heart’s inch governs the numinous and subtle,\nObscurity brings no harm to truth.\nMovement and stillness embrace the perfect principle,\nEver vigilant, one strengthens within.\n\nSacred teachings blaze like sun and stars,\nNoble conduct outshines ice and frost.\nHere, scriptures dwell in a land of grandeur,\nAncient traces deepen the primal

brambles and weeds.\nI seek out Lu’s former abode,\nWhere overgrown fields rise to lofty ridges.\nWith reverence, I gaze in awe,\nAs the autumn sky clears under the sun.\n\nEmerald terraces embrace the foreground,\nVast and distant, all returns to the finest trace.\nFleeting observations spur me to follow the ancients’ steps,\nDaring not to glimpse the boundless wilds.\nRapids rush past—who can stand as a pillar?\nThe great tone—who can serve as its phoenix?\nThe eight directions turn like wheels,\nA thousand years look up to this radiance.\n\n---\n\n**First Day of the New Year, Guihai Year**\n\nThe first sun alters the year’s course,\nLong rains at dawn begin to scatter.\nA gentle warmth heralds spring’s nurture,\nClouds and things thinly unfold.\nClear streams disperse along secluded banks,\nFine birds call through carved thickets.\nPlum blossoms drift along mossy paths,\nClusters of bamboo crisscross sparsely.\n\nPond duckweed gathers tender green,\nDense algae hold pure ripples.\nDelighting in these principles brings contentment,\nFor nature’s essence surely holds abundance.\nAnother year shames my aging teeth,\nMy dull learning—what end shall it find?\nAs dusk approaches, I guard solitude,\nThe girdle’s words are well worth inscribing.\n\n---\n\n**After the Lantern Festival, Rejoicing in Clear Skies, Ascending Jing Tong Hermitage**\n\nSpring’s warmth suffuses gentle harmony,\nMy frailty eases, my breath finds rest.\nThe hermitage stands in solemn emptiness,\nMy secluded quest now spans years.\nA narrow path is lost beneath fallen leaves,\nVines and creepers whisper through the void.\nPlum blossoms scatter lightly,\nBamboo and pine intertwine in splendor.\n\nStillness ever clears the spirit,\nSunlit peaks line the window like dark brows.\nLantern-lit nights mingle with market clamor,\nA lone crane soars beyond the sky’s bounds.\nI press my hand to my heart, filled with reverence,\nMy simple trust clings to profound reliance.\nWeary, I lean on the grove’s shade to return,\nHere I grasp the suspended solution.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Dream Crane Pavilion**\n\nThe perfected one attains the hidden meeting,\nHis

beings illumined by balanced *qi*.\nLeaning on his desk, he hums the *Gao*’s melody,\nSerene and joyful, free from the slightest care.\nGraceful as the wind’s passage,\nSwift as a unicorn’s flight.\nI look back to the pavilion’s past elegance,\nButterflies and ants now scorn the dust’s neglect.\n\nWhat use is baldness to release from bondage?\nRiding in a carriage—empty as Duke Wei’s honor.\nSorrow and misfortune stir emotions,\nLife and death—who can cast them aside like Zhuangzi?\nEntangled in turmoil, all perishes,\nConcentrated in emptiness, floating visions are clarified.\nI shame my longing for cap and sash,\nYet spread my wings, urging my wheels to soar.\n\nIn vast harmony with the mountain’s disciples,\nA thousand years stretch into distant flight.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing the Dug Spring**\n\nThe hermit tends his plow and spade,\nDelighting as the spring’s source flows freely.\nDrawing water from afar brings no fear of toil,\nFinding the spring, he shares it with neighbors.\nServants grow weary yet rejoice,\nThe world calls it a divine work.\nTracing the source, the stream grows clearer,\nStones gleam, the ravine runs full.\n\nThe perfect transformation nurtures the primal sea,\nIts ceaseless flow vast and boundless.\nThe ten thousand differences share a single principle,\nTracing back reveals beginning and end.\nGathering the gaze, not even a ladle’s worth,\nYet who can fathom its day-and-night labor?\nI lament those dull and ignorant,\nWho fail to glimpse the root’s origin.\n\nFrom this, I embrace seclusion’s purity,\nDrinking and rinsing in the wind of Chao and Xu.\n\n---\n\n**Cold Rain**\n\nNight rain gathers lingering cold,\nMorning bells enter the wooded hills.\nWithered branches cry in the fierce wind,\nSpring torrents run clear enough to rinse.\nWoodcutters return to smoke-wreathed doors,\nMountain birds rest on frosted citrons.\nMy breast holds hidden sorrow,\nMy thoughts are calm, free from strife.\n\nFields and wilds grow daily barren,\nHeaven’s harmony fears injury.\nMy solitary heart—with whom to discuss?\nMy halting steps shame the worthy successors.\nGazing at the scene, I feel the ebbing tide,\nSeparation—who can bridge it?\nCultivating the heart lies in constancy,\nBrushing my sleeves, I cast off worldly dust.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Hall of Continuing Goodness**\n\nWhen the jade tablets emerged after Qin’s fall,\nHow many teachings nearly vanished?\nThe perfect principle lay buried in brambles,\nThe imperial heart—how could it stray?\n\nThe Lu-Wang school revived the fading thread,\nFrom this, heaven’s benevolence was seen.\nIntegrity and goodness are innate norms,\nPractice and study make them ever more true.\nClarity and subtlety share a single root,\nThe profound should be worn at the girdle.\nSurveying antiquity, I follow the sages’ counsel,\nBeginning and end—all is bright and pure.\n\nThe young scholar inherits his family’s learning,\nHis goodness upholds plain sincerity.\nMountain radiance glows with spring’s moisture,\nLush forests hold the evening’s mist.\nDiscourse and song harmonize with friends’ benefit,\nAdmonitions are well worth heeding.\nFrom this,

winding bridge steps over mossy paths,\nA remote isle connects to woodcutters and fishermen.\nLush trees offer evening repose,\nHills and gardens suffice for his joy.\nI know he has long left the dust behind,\nHis inner cultivation fittingly hidden in emptiness.\nHis forebears’ virtue matched his distant aspirations,\nTheir radiance ever accompanies him.\n\nYesterday, I visited his gate,\nMorning winds scattered yellow leaves.\nI bowed deeply, washing away distant longing,\nOur parting at dusk was deeply hesitant.\nHis pure teachings find few in the world to match,\nYet I have long held them in my breast, no fool.\nThe model belongs to the venerable,\nWho can follow its unfolding and rolling?\n\nMy past longings have grown vast and distant,\nMy secluded traces surely hold abundance.\nHis advanced years stand firm as a pine,\nHis dark bond is rich and true.\nI wish to receive the Pure Capital’s teachings,\nTo be shown the jade casket’s scriptures.\n\n---\n\n**Eastern Garden, Composed for Wang Jingzhou of Qiantang**\n\nThe immortal transcendents lodge in hidden realms,\nShedding their traces to lightly float beyond the floating world.\nThe great recluses are not bound by worldly dust,\nForgetting form, they may dwell in secluded retreats.\nSuch a man possesses refined purity of bearing,\nUnfettering the mind to open the bound pavilion.\nHis fragrant garden vies in secluded construction,\nThe jade palace shuns gaudy splendor.\nAround his four walls flourish lush plants,\nThe empty courtyard spreads its first feast.\nBamboo grows thick with verdant feeling,\nCurtains and screens hang in emerald shade.\nWithin the yellow chamber, ritual classics reside,\nBefore the purple tower, dream clouds gather.\nRiding cranes, he traverses the notes of the sheng,\nRinsing at the well, he communes with cold springs.\nThe eastern dawn has long faded,\nYet dark virtue should be esteemed and advanced.\nLong ago, I wandered west in vast travels,\nWhere the numinous halls harmonized my circling steps.\nLofty paulownia shaded the sparse windows,\nThe crackling firewood heard the red strings’ music.\nEvening horns scattered the morning rain,\nAutumn tides followed the moon’s fullness.\nLakes and mountains slowed my leisurely steps,\nHow could worldly dust entangle me from without?\nThe venerable elders lent their aid and support,\nWith empty heart I wandered the Great Mystery.\nDo not delay in answering the Gate of Envy’s call,\nWith penetrating vision, perceive all things before they arise.\n\n---\n\n**Departing Jingkou at Dawn**\n\nThrough mist I set forth, the oars creak loudest,\nParting the river where perilous waves thin.\nThe cold city wears a sash of misty willows,\nAutumn waters embrace the wind-tossed reeds.\nLight rain dampens the forest’s southernwood,\nCongealed frost veils the islets’ withered grass.\nMy tiny boat meets the wild islet,\nI push open the secluded door to unfold old maps.\nThe quiet chamber reaches its utmost seclusion,\nWhite clouds linger beneath the eaves.\nTranscending worldly dust, I forsake high reclusion,\nLike Master Zizhen, I should dwell in valley retreat.\nHis posthumous writings fill the old tent,\nHis talent and feeling move the bound heavens.\nFine verses reveal his splendid literary grace,\nHis travels inquire of ancient ruins.\nSlanting mists suddenly form crystalline patterns,\nAs swift oars urge hastening words.\nPushing back the awning, I capture fleeting inspiration,\nExhorting myself to embrace tranquil emptiness.\nDistant blue mountains mark his path,\nThe ebbing tide hints at presence and absence.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the True Man’s Chamber on Mount Fanghu**\n\nThe sacred peaks bear auspicious omens,\nWhere immortals wander in jade palaces.\nHis lofty aspirations

double in value,\nYet he still recalls his forest wanderings.\nThe golden immortal bears the sea’s grace,\nThe dragon well nests on lofty peaks.\nSecret teachings suffice for casting the linchpin,\nConcentrating spirit, he guards the ring’s center.\nThrough rugged paths he traverses valleys and ravines,\nEarly forsaking the dust’s obscuring haze.\nIn Min and Yue, autumn’s sighs resound,\nClouds veil the forms of Yan and Tai.\nReturning east, he revives faded elegance,\nIn learning, we often follow one another.\nBrush and paper pour forth like sunrise,\nPainting and calligraphy pursue vast perfection.\nHis seal script reveals Han dynasty traces,\nClerical script humbles Qin’s seals.\nMy modest nature is dull and inferior,\nGrasping the inkstone through spring and winter.\nBy the stove and crucible, he sits amid plum snow,\nBy the tides and oysters, he chants to the creek’s wind.\nAdmiring orchids, he pours out the sea’s depths,\nHis wise discourse shines in Jiangdong.\nIn youth, he roughly possessed virtue,\nIn the capital, he toiled in attendance.\nFamous regions rely on his esteem,\nHow could noble rank and lofty status be prized?\nReturning with pendants, his hair already yellow,\nSuddenly withering amid the secluded cassia groves.\nSorrowful longing cuts deep in reverence,\nThe jade forest stands desolate and empty.\nTen years have passed in distant departure,\nSoaring high like the crane from Liaodong.\nMorning frost transforms the suburban scene,\nLibations and offerings hasten to thorn and thatch.\nOur literary bond shares sighs of lament,\nOur spiritual natures hope for hidden communion.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on Leisure**\n\nCeasing worldly ties, I lighten the dust’s harness,\nDispersing cares, I embrace tranquil emptiness.\nMountain rains deepen summer’s green,\nForest mists rise from twilight peaks.\nThe creek’s clamor presses near the courtyard,\nEmerald grass fills the deep pond.\nTall trees daily grow lush,\nYoung bamboo also casts cool shade.\nEach thing’s nature finds its own fitting place,\nFlourishing and fading share a single heart.\nSoaring high, I admire distant paths,\nChasing shadows is but vain pursuit.\nThe inscribed teachings illuminate past sages,\nIn solitude, I vigilantly guard against sinking.\nSubtle feelings I entrust to poems and scrolls,\nFew gather to discuss, why not lift the hairpin?\nThe wondrous principle is possessed by all,\nThe numinous source flows deep in hidden seeking.\nHow could I follow false traces,\nObstinately lingering in the empty forest?\n\n---\n\n**Morning Thoughts**\n\nEmerging at dawn, frozen thoughts already stir,\nA gentle wind fills the tall forest.\nThe fading river glimmers toward dawn,\nSparse stars fade in the wutong’s shade.\nVillage lanes wind beside distant islets,\nCocks crow, scattering the clustered woods.\nMorning mist veils the fragrant trees,\nNight’s haze lingers on lofty peaks.\nPine torrents cascade through the valleys,\nWalking alone, I traverse rugged paths.\nFalling branches are wet with scattered dew,\nA desolate coolness fills the empty space.\nDelighting in dwelling in secluded beauty,\nLong weary of the dust’s cage.\nStrolling the wilds, I indulge in leisure,\nHow could I be enslaved by mixed pursuits?\nRivers and springs fatten the carefree form,\nClouds and trees nourish the woodcutter’s heart.\nFar removed, I forsake worldly entanglements,\nSoaring high, I distance myself from ornate hairpins.\nFlowing springs echo the unhurried staff,\nStriking my zither in the hills.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending Mount Huagai**\n\nThe imperial carriage establishes the primal destiny,\nThe numinous traces reveal the divine foundation.\nSurpassing the great peak of Mount Hua,\nHis celestial truth long held the hidden handle.\nFortunate to follow and trace these steps,\nThis visit fulfills the earlier promise.\nProfound secrets open the dark teachings,\nAbundant merits adorn the deep rites.\nRefining form, he achieves the golden elixir,\nLaying down his halberd, he ascends the cinnabar radiance.\nKongtong’s cliffs open a cliffside altar,\nThe empty altar spreads a chessboard.\nThunder rumbles in the hollow caves,\nSpring veins contain cold moisture.\nTransforming scenes display mighty marvels,\nJade banners gleam in linked flight.\nDistant traces adorn successive generations,\nRivers and mountains vie in secluded wonder.\nIn late years, he receives his long-held admiration,\nClimbing and studying, he hastens to pursue.\nThe clustered mountains vie in hairpin adornment,\nThe side paths wind in perilous coils.\nFlying cliffs startle the spirit’s eyelashes,\nRevolving peaks race like jade dragons.\nClouds stretch like bright silk,\nWaters curve like delicate threads.\nValley echoes carry the bamboo’s sighs,\nForest fragrance scatters like coiling rainbows.\nJade palaces record their construction,\nIllusory blessings renew thatched huts.\nGuest lodges open to secluded views,\nEaves protect the cold mist.\nThe eight directions reach their limits,\nMyriad differences gather in subtle traces.\nThe world’s realm looks down upon the dust’s altar,\nHow lofty and low are Song and Hua!\nWeary, I rest amid mist and haze,\nGazing afar at the vast celestial steps.\nSupreme virtue shines in pure prayer,\nThe immortal’s plan fulfills hidden hopes.\nThe vast expanse merges in primal unity,\nWho can fathom its beginnings and ends?\n\n---\n\n**Visiting the Jade Prosperity Palace on West Mountain**\n\nBeyond the world, I deeply admire the distant,\nThe high immortals’ numinous traces.\nThe mighty capital stands by Jiang and Han,\nThe dark halls array the layered peaks.\nThe sun’s essence nurtures the heavens’ seasons,\nHeaven’s

surveys the old structures,\nAncient sites thrive with dense, hidden thickets.\nThe tower’s wheels lodge in vast emptiness—\nWhere now is the radiance of cinnabar splendor?\nThe common folk are bathed in gracious blessings,\nDaoist disciples hold fast to profound devotion.\nRivers and hills ever revolve in motion,\nTheir governance reflects the august heavens.\nNight’s qi sobers the forest’s silence,\nSpring’s harmony scatters the gentle breeze.\n\nI secretly trace Jing Dan’s wondrous path,\nShedding the mundane—how could I follow later?\nI steel myself, gazing up at the tracks of the ancients,\nThe grand vista stretches boundless and endless.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at Chengzhai**\n\nThe square and round revolve through the six voids,\nStillness and movement ceaselessly interact.\nMotion and rest root in the primal origin,\nSubtle congealment pervades the Three Realms.\nHow vast is the heart of the worthy and sage!\nEmbodying sincerity, it abides in no fixed

vast vision,\nThe dark mechanism returns to the source of transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Xian Spring in Winter**\n\nAt dawn I tread, ashamed of my slow progress,\nReturning to rest amid the beauty of grove and valley.\nThe outskirts’ creatures harmonize with the seasons,\nWild paths embrace the winding stream.\nI speak of turning toward the white-clouded peaks,\nMist-laden trees retain

Month**\n\nLast night’s rain dispelled autumn’s gloom,\nI sought the hidden, drifting on clear islets.\nAt dawn I prepared for the secluded tryst,\nTrue delight befits the waning heat.\nFlowers and petals display linked fragrance,\nElders and worthies excel in worldly discourse.\nGentle currents cradle shallow sands,\nDistant rapids secretly connect to the shore.\nSheer rocks scatter like the loom’s supports,\nThe limpid pool swirls with cobalt depths.\nDuckweed and gulls dot the snowy blossoms,\nSandpipers float like silver threads.\nWild vines darken the dense shade,\nDistant mountains

doors.\nDeep moss obscures kitchen and granary,\nVerdant creepers drape the loom’s frame.\nA mighty whistle severs all dust and haze,\nAn empty song stirs the mist and fog.\nA single chamber hangs from the cliff,\nSeats arrayed on level sands for debate.\nThis gathering transcends the common—\nHarmony and awe mingle with cups and platters.\nHad I not attuned to the immortal’s tune,\nYears would pass like Penglai’s isles.\nSincerely I visit the ancient shrine,\nAshamed my steps lag behind the dust.\n\nRed Mound commands the wild and strange—\nFitting that wind and thunder guard it.\nThrough boundless kalpas, I view fleeting bubbles,\nA single impulse washes away a thousand ages.\n\n---\n\n**Composed While Watching the Rain**\n\nEarly summer suffers from ceaseless rain,\nTowering trees luxuriate in lush growth.\nThe stream roars with sudden surging torrents,\nThe peaks stand pure, residual haze bright.\nLush greenery shades the eaves and pillars,\nTall bamboos lend their cool to the secluded.\nHeavy burdens of human affairs grow rare,\nMud and mire halt the wheels’ progress.\nFor now, I find solace in letters and ink,\nHolding to the Dao lies in nurturing and following.\nHidden virtue embraces the abyss within,\nFrom the subtle it reaches the vast and deep.\nDare I hope for recognition like the Mo and Si?\nI can only sigh in admiration of the lofty mountain.\nYin accumulates, succeeding the scorching heat,\nI shame myself for worldly thoughts.\nSitting, my mind wanders to the sun’s song,\nVast and boundless as the source’s spring.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at

harmonized with dark simplicity,\nMy refined bearing illuminated the realm.\nAbundant cultivation hopes for lush growth,\nInheritance and succession await the heir’s gaze.\n\n---\n\n**Occasional Verse on a Late Outing**\n\nThe bright pond brims with fragrant islets,\nNew currents swell in joyful surges.\nDark clouds drift past the rustling trees,\nThe sheer ravine scatters the cold mist.\nHuman tracks grow sparse in mud and mire,\nTwilight deepens with birds and frogs.\nDistant thoughts stir memories of past trysts,\nClustered cares weigh on pressing duties.\nResting in seclusion, I attain this ease,\nYet worldly concerns still entwine and coil.\nVain traces chase the dust’s birth,\nThe true source wondrously abides nowhere.\nSpring’s splendor swiftly yields to another year,\nFrailty and age deepen my shame and longing.\nGain and loss follow the workings of transformation,\nHills and gardens suffice for measured steps.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Rain**\n\nEarly heat returns to the old dwelling,\nThe vermilion sun’s fire grows ever fiercer.\nLying ill beneath the central grove,\nI recline in stillness, free of care.\nThe windy ravine roars with rushing streams,\nField frogs croak amid dense thickets.\nFish glide lightly through fragrant algae,\nMist settles over the towering forest’s shade.\nVerdant feelings rise in tall bamboos,\nThe empty courtyard thrives with intertwined branches.\nGathering clouds suddenly form a downpour,\nAll night the torrents rush in.\nThe lotus storm crosses the morning’s chill,\nI cast aside my hairpin to tend the brambles.\nSmoke and waves stretch far, free of dust,\nHeart and trace remain serene, lofty, and aloof.\nHow could I compare to the mosquito’s drone?\nWhy trouble myself with birds’ play?\nVainly I sigh—my long-held aspirations thwarted,\nConfinement deepens my distant yearning.\nAnxieties and indignation remain unresolved,\nFor now, I find solace in the flowing stream.\nI speak of following the recluses’ path,\nForever parting from the human world.\n\n---\n\n**Composed While Walking the Southern Ravine**\n\nGrateful for my humble thatched hut, I return to my staff and ascend for a distant gaze.\nHills and forests brim with autumn’s qi, ravines and valleys gather blossoming grasses.\nShaded gullies veil faint clouds, layered peaks stand stark and solitary.\nThe plain, drenched by passing rain, lets fallen leaves dance lightly in the wind.\n\nAlas, I am trapped by ill fate, my retreat not for show but true withdrawal.\nBedridden, my strength wanes daily, the cost of medicine shames me—no small sum.\nI know regret and shame grow ever longer, gain and loss invite only scorn and ridicule.\nChoosing what to grasp, I see only filth and loftiness; rushing to flatter, I mimic frowns and smiles.\nI scorn the careless who chase the current, sighing at those who clamor for rank in vain.\nSilken threads may yet serve some use, but a cracked jar can never ring clear.\nI rest my body, tending my jar,

pillar’s crane,\nThe dawn clouds’ light stirs the Ge Pond’s dragon.\nWorldly passions shift like past dreams,\nThe vast kalpa’s numinous terrace—far, I cannot follow.\n\n---\n**End of *Xianquan Collection*, Scroll Eleven**\n**Beginning of *Xianquan Collection*, Scroll Twelve**\n\n**Seven-Character Long Song: The Song of Mi Yaoshi**\n*Composed by Zhang Yuchu, the Non-Action Heavenly Master of Qishan*\n\nThe Great Void boundless, vast and profound—\nWho first carved the signs of yin and yang’s divide?\nThe august True Sovereign wields the pivot of transformation,\nStirring, exhaling, turning the key within the moth-eaten lock.\nAll ten thousand beings share a single source,\nJade tablets and sacred scrolls guard the arcane.\nThe Mysterious Origin Sage-Ancestor unlocked the wondrous mechanism,\nA million subtle words revealed to the empty vastness.\nVast and formless, ere heaven and earth arose,\nNameless, imageless—all was spontaneity.\nRefined a hundred times, essence-gold returns to true liquid,\nDragon and tiger, crow and hare entwine in embrace.\nSince ancient times, such perfect adepts were rare,\nThe Perfected One’s treasures passed down through kalpas untold.\nZhurong’s descendant received the strange doctrine,\nBarefoot in hempen robes, he knocked at the Thunder Cave.\nHe claimed to command the opening and closing of rain and sun,\nWielding the thunderbolt’s whip, driving them with fierce might.\nIn youth, he strode through the Golden Horse Gate,\nGreat elders and meritorious ministers all bowed in admiration.\nYet he cast off the shackles of cap and sash,\nRiding the wind and thunder straight to Wu and Yue.\nAt that time, gold and jade adorned the heroes,\nWho could have foreseen the dust of the world would plunge them into despair?\nVernal splendor before their eyes turned to ashes,\nProudly they spurned the fragrant paths, discoursing at will.\nReturning, they at last beheld the True Lord’s face,\nLonging to linger in Immortal Crag and Ghost Valley.\nSweeping blossoms, pouring water, they played the pure flute,\nWorldly cares and vulgar thoughts never touched them.\nFrom the cave’s perspective, comings and goings are not worth counting—\nAscend my stone steps, wash your ears, and listen to the murmuring stream.\nYesterday’s words suddenly recall my native land,\nThe Heavenly Crown Altar long lay overgrown and abandoned.\nCarved eaves and painted beams—what labor they cost!\nYet after years, the former vision stands mighty once more.\nCarving through twin cliffs, the Emperor’s Palace soars,\nStone chambers and cloudy forests store thunder and rain.\nI, too, sought the mountains and built a thatched hut,\nThe Pi-pa Peaks gleaming like jade.\nI have heard the Great Elixir must be sought early,\nOnce refined, its radiance fills the void like a candle.\nDongting and Pengli’s waves surge dark and deep,\nThe Yellow Crane has departed—where does it fly?\nMercury and lead’s inversion is no trifling matter,\nFor me, it dissects the essence of heaven and earth.\nWho says the Grotto-Heavens hold other scriptures?\nThe heaven within the grotto is but emptiness.\nIt is neither the August One’s brush, broad as ten feet,\nNor the Primordial Beginning’s discourse on the suspended pearl.\nI trouble you to strike the moth-eaten wood and ask:\nWill you gather the dark and return the Great Clod to its origin?\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on *True Person of Square Gourd Peak’s* Painting *Snow Clearing at Strange Peaks***\n\nMin and E’s primordial snow,\nAtop Kunlun’s peak through ten thousand kalpas.\nThe Gourd Immortal’s ink splashes all with ice and jade,\nSword Pass and Ruan’s cliffs pierce the westernmost sky.\nLayered peaks surge like waves—how wondrous and strange!\nWarmth stirs the fish and dragons, splitting Xiang River’s flow.\nThe clearing light first parts the Qin and Duan Bridge,\nPine billows sweep past the moon over Mount Emei.\nThe old house by the blue river, the mountain’s seclusion,\nThe farthest shore’s shadowed cliffs turn the frozen stream.\nYuan An’s door and lane lie three feet deep in white,\nAncient trees blaze like coral hooks.\nLaughing at my frail self, lying in hills and gullies,\nJade trees and jasper blossoms shroud the misty wastes.\nIn the great marsh, heavy furs sink in deep frost and sleet,\nSpring’s breath gradually turns the plum’s fragrant buds.\nWeary, I lay down my brush,\nUnrolling this scroll, my heart stirs in wonder.\nThe lingering inspiration of Wangchuan—distant, yet pursued,\nSilently facing the solitary light, I vanish into the boundless.\n\n**Inscription on the *Pine Shade Imparting the Dao* Painting**\n\nAt Wei Ridge, the immortal builds his hut east of the jasper grove,\nThe cloud-nesting Daoist paints a hundred-foot pine.\nBefore the Hall of Seeing Mountains, its shade spreads like a lofty canopy,\nRoots coil round ironstone, branches coil like dragons.\nHe claims the ancient immortal of Mud-Pellet Peak\nOnce sought the Dao on Jasper Mountain.\nLike the sacred altar where swallows peck white stone,\nLong vines and autumn reeds hum with the wind.\nAbove, it grazes the Nine Heavens’ scattered Silver River,\nBelow, it links the Three Mountains’ distant starry rainbow.\nThe Dao of Mud-Pellet Peak surveys boundless kalpas,\nPeerless in verdant grandeur, gazing into primordial chaos.\n\nLong ago, the immortal rode a crane over the ridge,\nPlaying his flute across Min Sea to visit famed peaks.\nMy old friend, honored as a father,\nReturns like a gull to Plum Blossom Pavilion by the creek.\nJia Ding’s mighty words tempered like steel,\nHis tender whispers deep as Dongfang Shuo’s wit.\nThe literary splendor of Daoist mountains—how desolate!\nWith wings outspread, he soars beyond whale’s horn.\n\nI recall mooring my boat by the stream,\nCoarse wine beneath pine shade, the creek moon full.\nScales of fish dart through empty green,\nZither notes drift through twilight mist.\nTowering trees and sparse bamboos defy depiction,\nStroking the present, mourning the past, my heart drifts.\nBi Hong and Wei Yan were called unmatched,\nYet only the Gourd Immortal’s brush nears their fragrance.\nCloud-descendants should strive to inherit this fame,\nAmid turquoise waters and forest peaks in evening’s chill.\nThis frost-enduring timber, fit for beams and pillars,\nRarely chosen from shadowed cliffs and snowy crags.\nLaughing, I sing amid orchid and thoroughwort,\nLonging to pluck pine blossoms to brew spring’s nectar.\nRaising my head, I summon the two old immortals, Chen and Bai,\nDrunk beyond the clouds, playing with autumn’s hues.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription on the *Celestial Palm of Mount Hua* Painting**\n\nGreat Hua Peak, anciently named the Sacred Mountain,\nIts primordial darkness and earthly might shape solid stone.\nRoots thrust west to towering Song and Tai,\nTen-thousand-zhang blue cliffs lean into the void.\nSlanted like a half-moon, its palm gleams bright,\nHanging the Silver River from the azure sky.\nTouching the heavens, its snowy ridges stretch like a screen,\nPiled high, the clustered peaks rival Liang and Huo.\nThe Son of Heaven’s tours have graced it many times,\nAncient shrines and halls stand a thousand *xun* tall.\nBroken bridges stretch to quiet islets,\nOld trees bow low over deep streams.\nFloating clouds seem to veil evening’s bells and drums,\nIron chains hang high through misty haze.\n\nHere dwells the immortal Wang Ziqiao,\nTigers and leopards guard his stone door.\nIn our dynasty’s prosperous reign, rites are grand,\nWe dispatch feathered messengers to convey sincerity.\nThe jade altar’s ascent is too sacred to attempt,\nReturning, I hasten to the Golden Gate to report to the throne.\nHis mighty words and wondrous carvings illuminate the ages,\nQin and Han vainly boast of Feng and Shan.\nMountain spirits and river lords descend with auspicious signs,\nThe ancestral altars stand firm, the celestial realm secure.\nThe Giant Spirit split stone to channel the river,\nBright stars and Jade Maidens dwell on cinnabar mounds.\nThe Yellow River’s whirlpools rise from the sky’s edge,\nThe White Emperor’s golden essence glows all around.\nThe carriage’s axle and arrow’s shaft pave the path to heaven,\nI long to follow it and speak with the gods.\nI would summon Ma and Wei to ride deer aloft,\nBut where are the verdant cliffs and cinnabar valleys?\nStaff in hand, I laugh and clap Hong Ya’s shoulder,\nHungry, I feast on fallen geese and rosy clouds,\nThirsty, I drink from the Jade Well’s lotus.\nIf I meet one with purple robes and crimson temples,\nI’ll borrow his tea-dragon to soar and return.\nThe Gourd Immortal, white-haired, marvels at the painting’s perfection,\nHow could Nie’s and Shu’s traces ever fade?\nA single breath of cool wind spans ninety thousand leagues—\nWhy need I get drunk beneath Emei’s moon?\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**On the *Immortal’s Intent of Square Gourd* Painting**\nWeary of rouge and powder marring autumn’s face,\nI wash the wind’s dust from one or two peaks.\nTo know the immortals’ flavorless realm,\nCast off worldly grime and sit beneath the pines.\n\n**The Withered Tree of the True Man of the Western Realm**\nEvening sun at the ferry, water merges with sky,\nFallen leaves, cold crows on the ancient road.\nMy brush races with autumn’s endless sounds—\nWhere does the fishing rod stand in the western wind?\n\n**Secluded Dwelling in Cloudy Gorges**\nEmerald cliffs, cinnabar gorges, clouds over a thousand acres,\nA small thatched hut barely contains the seclusion.\nI hear that by the sunny window where books are spread,\nWisteria flowers and autumn wind bring flying rain.\n\n**Bamboo Leaves of Square Gourd’s Immortal Crag**\nReturning by wild boat, sated with wonders,\nIn my sleeve, a green jade memento of that time.\nImmortal dwellings often lie in azure emptiness—\nThey show the world only half a branch.\n\n**Gazing at Immortals Pavilion**\nImmortals tread the earth, following sacred traces,\nGazing back at simurghs and phoenixes through layered peaks.\nDo not say the numinous terrace is untraceable—\nHere in Jiangnan stands the highest summit.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar Cliff**\nMercury and lead refined into golden sand,\nMoss-covered cliffs and shoulders become home.\nGazing afar at the white clouds’ window,\nI still long for the Great Return’s immortal sprouts.\n\n**Cloudy Grotto**\nHollowed stone grottoes where clouds and mist drift,\nSacred herbs and black mushrooms—how many years old?\nSitting, I listen to wind and thunder rise beneath my feet,\nSuspecting beyond this, there is no heaven.\n\n**Dragon Pool**\nA sheer torrent embraces the rocky shore,\nA pool of cold green guards its mossy robe.\nThe coiled dragon lurks deep in the mountain’s foot,\nOnce it rode cloud-glue to return as rain.\n\n**Scholar’s Pavilion**\nThis splendid hall once birthed jade-hall immortals,\nIts literary brilliance and radiance illuminate the purple mystery.\nScattered among mortals like countless pearls,\nThe soaring whale’s legacy stirs a thousand years.\n\n**Star-Worshipping Altar**\nStanding tall on the first peak of empty azure,\nWith flying steps, I mount the wind.\nTouching the summit, I forget heaven’s vastness,\nPointing and gesturing amid the night’s vital breath.\n\n**Jade Court Lodge**\nTen-thousand-*ren* cinnabar light illuminates the pearl,\nIn the open court, I sit serenely like a jade lotus.\nMortals vainly worship the realm of luminous clarity—\nSimurghs and cranes wheel in the sky, listening to the *Step Void*.\n\n**Star-Plucking Pavilion**\nA lofty pavilion crowns the emerald haze,\nStars are plucked, clad only in five-zhu robes.\nWashing the void, the silver desert leaves no autumn trace,\nAt night, jade pipes and cranes return aloft.\n\n**Gazing at the Numinous Mountain**\nJade-carved hibiscus gleams in the gaze,\nCrystal sprouts grow, all imbued with immortal spirit.\nWhen shall I learn to shear Wu Song’s waters,\nAnd cut a single green leaf from Lotus Peak?\n\n**Osmanthus in the Moon**\nGolden grains’ autumn fragrance at the moon’s half-branch,\nGladly sharing its pure shadow in the melting ice.\nIf this body dwelt in the realm of pure emptiness,\nNo need to wait for cloud-coiffed magpies to cross the bridge.\n\n**Cloud Wilderness Painting**\nGazing afar at the world’s toil on the vast desert’s edge,\nMidair, the sound of cranes and pipes drifts in stillness.\nOnce I grasped the stringless intent,\nNot only pine nests—all is white clouds.\n\n**Chess Peak**\nFortunate to tread the high cliff, meeting Spring Peak,\nStone altars and clouds veil east and west.\nImmortal chess differs from Shang Mountain’s game—\nAll lies within the River Chart’s doubled numbers.\n\n**Washing-the-Eyes Pool**\nEyes sweep all peaks, yet weeds choke narrow vales—\nCrane-robes, soiled and frayed, bear no mere dust.\nHow fine to rinse a kalpa’s worldly grime\nWith but half a cup of heaven’s ladled water.\n\n**Lyric to \"Spring in the Qin Garden\" · Ascending the True**\nFrom primal chaos’ murky dawn,\nBefore the limitless, ere time began,\nWhen yin and yang first cleft the void,\nAnd heaven-earth took fixed abode,\nThrough cycles of stillness and motion,\nThe True Lord dwelt at the center.\nA single spark of numinous brightness\nShone through heaven, illumined earth—\nOne day, the ancient circle fused,\nWisdom and folly both transcended.\nWorldly ties now severed,\nBehold the jade-green pool’s mirror,\nThe moon-polished pearl of the heart.\n\nThe eight wastes shine boundless, no corner hid,\nThrough endless night, the ice-jade nectar melts.\nTrue lead meets mercury, Kan and Li unite,\nFire-dragon and water-tiger, the white key breathes.\nWhite snow congeals the chariot,\nYellow sprouts fill the crucible,\nThunder shakes Kunlun, piercing the Great Void.\nWhen merit is complete,\nAwait the embryo’s perfection, spirit’s transformation,\nThen together ascend heaven’s thoroughfare.\n\n**Lyric to \"Water Tune\" #1 · Dharma Sea**\nBefore symbols arose in the primordial,\nEre father and mother were born,\nBefore time itself—\nA single truth stood revealed,\nIts radiance ancient, the wellspring of spirit.\nThough yin and yang churn within,\nThough the five phases invert and cluster,\nVast qi nurtures the Three Fields.\nWhere its function unleashes killing force,\nThunder and lightning shake the boundless.\n\nNeither mind, nor dharma,\nNor even Chan—\nSubtle, wondrous, profound,\nA thousand gold coins would not buy its transmission.\nDo not cling to talismans or incantations,\nBut directly awaken to the Mysterious Pass’s patriarch,\nWhose fullness lies in your own perfected spirit.\nTiles and thatch, reeds and grasses—\nAll serve the world yet transcend it.\n\n**Lyric to \"Wind Through Pines\" · Inquiry into Learning**\nTen years of lamp-shadowed nights, my constant companion,\nCold and heat alternating, hastening time.\nHow often I laid down the rhinoceros-horn brush by the narrow window,\nPored over tattered scrolls—who else savored their flavor?\nBeyond the curtain, snow deepens, wind tightens,\nYet plum blossoms thrive, and the muse of poetry stirs.\n\nA thousand classics, ten thousand histories suffice for governance,\nYet my scholarly ambition grows ever more vast.\nI question the Heavenly Root and Moon Grotto,\nPondering the affairs of ancient and modern literature—\nHow many have lost their way at the ford?\nGather in the luminous clarity of the empty spirit,\nAnd wherever you lean on your blossom staff, spring follows.\nFree of vulgar thoughts—\nContemplate and investigate.\n\n**Contemplating the Mundane**\nBeneath Misty Lake Peak,\nI wove a nest of pines and clouds,\nForgetting dawn and dusk in motion.\nThe floating world’s endless rise and fall—\nA laugh, and it scatters like duckweed in a dream.\nGreen bamboo and yellow blossoms,\nThe sound of water lending color—\nWho knows this flavor’s depth?\nLimpid and bright,\nForm and emptiness both self-evident.\n\nSky’s light and cloud’s shadows drift,\nPainting the long expanse of azure,\nA mirror-clear pool.\nSpring departs, autumn arrives, yet the heart remains at ease,\nEntrusted to the wild’s fish and crows.\nSeas vast, rivers calm,\nMoon bright, wind gentle,\nPure pipes’ notes fade into silence.\nThen stride forth to the azure waves,\nReciting aloud beneath heaven’s canopy.\n\n**Lyric to \"Water Tune\" · Inner Work**\nThe supreme Dao speaks no words,\nIn silence, it guards the compass’s center.\nVast and obscure, it circulates through the unseen,\nA single darkness animating the primal palace.\nGathering metal’s essence and wood’s sap,\nTrue earth captures lead and mercury within—\nIn an instant, divine power manifests.\nMeasuring the trigrams, sounding the key,\nThunder and wind roar.\nKan and Li invert,\nFire soars over the azure sea, refining true emptiness.\nThe Great One embraces true form,\nThe jade crucible’s flowing pearls congeal,\nSpirit and transformation merge with the mysterious.\nReturn to Penglai’s isles,\nThrough kalpas vast, play in the primordial chaos.\n\n**Lyric to \"Court Full of Fragrance\" · Mountain Dwelling**\nI cast aside my raven-black staff,\nSought a thatched hut—\nWho knew it would be but remnant streams and broken hills?\nI dug a pond, planted trees,\nPlum and bamboo left to twine freely.\nSweet grasses and idle blossoms carpet the earth,\nMist and rosy clouds enfold the mossy path and wicker gate.\nNo one comes—\nSpring winds and autumn moons,\nPines and chrysanthemums keep me company in quiet murmurs.\n\nWith bowl and gourd, I live as fate allows,\nNo glory, no shame,\nAlong woodcutter’s paths and fisherman’s bays.\nWith forest apes and valley crows,\nI share evening’s joy and morning’s delight.\nSweeping away the dust of passion and karmic grime,\nI don my robe, sit in true breath,\nNurturing the returning elixir.\nIn leisurely ease,\nA lone zither, a single crane—\nFrost and dew leave no mark on my face.\n\n**Lyric to \"Su Wu the Slow\" · Leisure’s Dissolution**\nAwakening to illusion, seeking truth,\nI vowed for years to transcend birth and death.\nThrough wind-sifted snow, I compiled texts,\nReading by night, chanting by day,\nProbing the wisdom of sages past and present.\nDao’s mystery, Chan’s lineage—\nTen thousand differences, one root.\nTo discern what lies beyond scrutiny,\nThis boundless, unobstructed true emptiness,\nNot even the moon’s waxing and waning affects it.\n\nHow laughable—\nA bamboo chair, a thin meditation mat,\nA pine-framed window, an osmanthus casement,\nEach step a stride toward loftiness.\nYet the world’s dust I shun,\nWater and clouds my companions,\nReclining in my old garden amid wind and snow.\nFine steeds and sable robes,\nJade sleeves and rouge shells—\nAll fleeting splendor, idle talk.\nTurn swiftly—here is the shore,\nCurtains part to reveal light,\nThe moon of the mind, the heaven of nature.\n\n**Lyric to \"All Crimson\" · Worldly Observations**\nI recall my youth,\nWhere once I sought pleasure—\nAll now changed, no trace remains.\nI listen to the sea’s swelling tide,\nThe brocade of waves receding,\nThe four cities’ eternal spring.\nAt the song-and-dance tower, I loathed the setting sun,\nAmid pipes and strings, I raged at drunken oblivion.\nBehold the present—\nHow many moments of glory and withering?\nSorrow defies order.\n\nDream’s phantoms wake,\nWorldly cares disperse—\nVain sighs, empty warnings.\nI lament the orchid oar, the reed pavilion,\nThe cold water’s misty tinkling.\nNo share in rivers and lakes’s frayed ends,\nYet heaven’s heart-moon casts its reflection in the limpid pool.\nReflecting on this floating life,\nI see through joy and sorrow—\nThe river’s waves grow still.\n\n**Lyric to \"Drunken River Moon\" · Rivers and Lakes**\nOnce I followed a fishing skiff,\nPlayed with autumn’s waves,\nWitnessing rivers and lakes’ vast expanse.\nBeyond the two shores’ white caltrop isles,\nDew glistened on reeds, maple leaves fell.\nMidnight’s tide roared,\nMidheaven’s moon shone,\nThe plum-blossom horn turned again.\nPushing open the hatch, I asked—\nWhere were my old friends? Everywhere, desolation.\n\nI launched the oars at Shepherd’s Shore, the fishing village,\nBy the city’s edge at dusk,\nReturning crows cried in flocks.\nGreen wine, yellow blossoms,\nAmid mist and rain—\nHow many dreams of my old garden’s groves and vales?\nThe crumbling pagoda’s wind howled,\nSea gates and mountains shrank,\nSpring’s end, willows draped the outer walls.\nReturning to the grove,\nI shook my robes, gazed loftily at the boundless.\n\n**Lyric to \"Gazing at Plum Blossoms\" · Illusory Bonds**\nThis floating world knows no bounds,\nIts dusty burdens seen through—\nHow long can illusion last?\nThrough kalpas of enmity and kinship,\nLifetimes of acquaintance,\nThin as a wisp of cloud, this affection.\nIn vain I boast of cunning schemes,\nParading heroism—\nOnly adding to karmic shadows.\n\nAll schemes and stratagems exhausted,\nChasing fame and profit through right and wrong.\nCreation is impartial—\nYet the spirit’s terrace dims itself,\nSinking in the burning sea of suffering.\nCast it all away:\nWild waters, sparse woods, no trace of passage,\nMoon bright, wind gentle.\n\n**Lyric to \"Unraveling Red\" · Awakening**\nThe true nature of the original self is empty as space,\nIts narrow bounds dissolved, round clarity revealed.\nPassions’ dust obscures the heart-pearl’s light,\nDrowning in the deep abyss—\nYet the spirit’s radiance never fades,\nA single gleam of brilliance, never far.\nSweep away the floating clouds,\nAll phenomena unobstructed,\nThe heart of heaven appears.\n\nWildflowers, crying crows—asking amidst ease,\nSpring gazes upon seas and mulberry fields,\nHow many shallows and depths?\nFlourishing and decay alternate in constant flux,\nAll sorrows of mountains and bitter seas,\nWandering, hard to turn back.\nSuddenly awakened—\nHeaven and earth hold wondrous mystery.\nBy the pine and bamboo,\nIn quiet solitude, trace the true source.\nAt Caoxi’s crossroads, no shadowed trees,\nNeither dharma nor Chan.\nOnly when the yang within Kan arises,\nLight surges like rolling waves.\n\nWho grasps stillness, drinks the elixir,\nDispels floating cares?\nSeeing without form,\nHearing without sound,\nSpeaking without distinction.\nThis carefree, drifting life—truly enviable,\nNestled in white clouds’ embrace, cradling folly and weariness.\nWith cold springs and withered trees,\nDimly glimpsed, the pot of heaven.\n\n**Lyric to \"Wind Through Pines\"**\nIn Jiangcheng, drowned in sickly wine, hard to savor,\nThin temples startle at morning’s hairpin.\nSummer’s heat gone, autumn’s light already narrow,\nRed dust far, the slanting sun turns sticky.\nOrchid curtains hold lingering night’s traces,\nClear frost still dampens spring robes.\nOn Qinhuai, the tide settles, jade-green,\nReturning swallows rest, murmuring.\nWhite clouds’ curtains and drapes grow cold too soon—\nWho now asks of crow-script or fish-letters?\nSoon, the sound of oars returning,\nYellow blossoms, white wine, south of the village.\n\n*End of Volume Twelve of Jianquan Collection*\n*(Note: The original tune title was mistakenly given as \"Water Dragon Chant\")*",

The Dao is not illuminated without literature, and literature is not established without the Dao. Though analytically they may be considered two, in essence they are fundamentally one.\n\nThe covering and bearing of Heaven and Earth, the transformation of yin and yang, the alternation of cold and heat, the coming and going of the sun and moon, the flowing and standing of mountains and rivers, the flourishing and withering of grasses and trees—none of these are apart from the Dao, none apart from literature. How could they be separated into two, or forcibly united as one?\n\nThus, when the sages arose, they followed the Dao of spontaneity and expressed it as the literature of spontaneity, never imposing the slightest trace of their own intent. Therefore, they composed the *Book of Changes* in accordance with the principles of transformation, the *Book of Documents* in accordance with the forms of instruction, the *Book of Songs* in accordance with the traces of governance, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* in accordance with the methods of praise and blame, the *Book of Rites* in accordance with the substance of ritual decorum, and the *Book of Music* in accordance with the function of harmony. These Six Classics endure through Heaven and Earth, uniting past and present without change, precisely because they arise from spontaneity.\n\nWhere else could later writers of literature turn? After the decline of the Zhou, the Kingly Way faded and the Hundred Schools flourished, each vying with private opinions and conjectural theories, displaying rhetorical skill to outdo one another. Among them, scarcely one or two did not deviate from the Dao.\n\nAt that time, there was Laozi, whose words took non-action and quiescence as the Dao, and who composed a work of over five thousand characters. Later ages have seen those who governed by his teachings and achieved order—perhaps these came closest to the Dao.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Succession, Celestial Master Zhang of Non-Action, inherited the teachings of Laozi through his family lineage, being the forty-third transmission. By nature, the Master was keenly intelligent and of towering talent and insight. He exhaustively studied the texts of the Jade Treasury, the alchemical crucible, and the golden and jade scriptures of the Daoist canon, while also delving deeply into the Six Classics, the philosophers, the histories, and the works of the Hundred Schools. In the realm of literary composition, he brought each form to its utmost refinement.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, in his successive appointments to the imperial court, he was ever esteemed for the excellence of his learning, deeply favored by the celestial canopy, and repeatedly honored with special commendations and the honor of being summoned to the imperial presence, his annual stipends ever increasing. The princes, nobles, high ministers, and scholar-officials all treated him with the utmost reverence. For in the literary heartland of Jiangyou, where the legacy of Master Wen Zheng of Wu and Master Wen Jing of Yu still flourished, the Master surpassed even their achievements. How could his attainments have been merely incidental?\n\nWhen asked to inspect his collected poetry and prose—several dozen scrolls in all—and to compose a preface, I found his verse to be profound and serene, his prose rich and elegant, so that one reads with admiration unceasing. How do they compare to those of this age, who cling to their glosses and exegeses, complacently content with mere talent and skill?\n\nYet the Master, bearing the weighty responsibility of leading the ancestral lineage of the Dao, devoted himself wholly to transforming others, guiding them toward goodness, and aiding the state in securing its blessings. What appears here in these writings is but the overflow of his vast learning. Nevertheless, I have observed that the Master’s virtue and work are rooted in non-action, enabling him to roam the mind in the Great Beginning and unite with the Dao. Moreover, he has steeped himself in the literary arts of the Six Classics, explored the doctrines of the Hundred Schools, and thus, when he gives expression to his thoughts in writing, principle and intent converge, achieving excellence without striving for it. How could his contributions to the Way of Laozi and Zhuangzi be compared to the boasts of those who indulge in wild fantasies?\n\nAs the Master and I share a bond of lifelong friendship, whenever we discuss these matters, we do so with animated delight, clapping our hands in lively discourse until the conversation is exhausted. Thus, I have written this preface.\n\nThe work is titled *Xiànquán*, after the name of his retreat.\n\nPreface by Wang Shen of Jinhua, Erudite of the Directorate of Education.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Xiànquán* Literary Collection of the Celestial Master of Non-Action of Qishan**\n\nThe *Xiànquán* Collection is the work of the Perfected Zhang, the forty-third Celestial Master in succession from the Han. The Perfected One’s learning and conduct run deep, his natural endowments and insight surpassing all others. He has mastered the Three Teachings, fusing them into a single path, and has thoroughly explored the doctrines of the various philosophers and the Hundred Schools, attaining effortless clarity in all. Thus, when he gives voice to his literary compositions and discourses, they are bold, towering, and magnificent—reading them stirs one to ceaseless applause.\n\nI have long admired his writings, which flow like clouds traversing the sky, radiant and resplendent, their transformations beyond measure, assuming myriad forms in an instant, brilliant in their artistry. They are also like autumn waters, rich and deep, stirred by a gentle breeze into waves that stretch across ten thousand acres, a single expanse of jade-like clarity, profound in their serenity. His *ci*, *fu*, poetry, and songs each achieve the utmost in grace, freshness, and purity, capturing the natural wonder of Heaven’s spontaneity—truly a work that combines every excellence and embodies all beauty.\n\nI have heard that on the famed Dragon-Tiger Mountain, where numinous *qi* gathers and the finest essences converge, Perfected Ones have emerged in succession, transmitting the Dao and its virtue through the ages. Yet it is only in the present Perfected One that I see one whose inner richness of the Dao is matched by the outward brilliance of his literary art, making him a literary colossus of his age.\n\nSince the founding of our august dynasty, the Great Progenitor, the High Emperor, unified the realm, and the vital *qi* of heaven and earth flourished in full. The celestial mandate has prospered, and culture has flourished for over thirty years. Since the present Emperor ascended the throne, the *qi* has grown ever more abundant, and the mandate ever more prosperous. Even in the remotest corners of the land, none fail to display their talents and present their works, striving to distinguish themselves in their time. How much more so in this land of literary heritage, this lineage of divine brilliance, where one may leisurely bask in the imperial grace and immerse oneself in the classics? Thus, the *Xiànquán* Collection, Scroll One, composed by the Celestial Master of Non-Action, Zhang Yuchu of Qishan.\n\n*Chongdao* [Carving of the Dao]",

The substantial resides within the void, desolate and without limit, as a single *qi* pervades the emptiness. Without the void, things could not transform and circulate, as if lacking a vessel to contain their subtle workings; yet within the substantial, there are indeed convergence and dispersion, presence and absence. Without the substantial, *qi* could not bind and weave, open and close, as if lacking a foundation to conceal its function; yet within the void, there are ascent and descent, growth and decline, movement and stillness.\n\nThe vastness of heaven and earth takes the Great Void as its essence, while the ceaseless generation and transformation of the myriad things between them arise from the interplay of yin and yang, movement and stillness. The alternation of cold and heat, the distinction of day and night, the ceaseless revolution of heaven—manifest as the luminous sun and stars, majestic as thunder and lightning, nourishing as wind, rain, frost, and dew. The ceaseless revolution of earth—towering as mountains and peaks, flowing as rivers and seas, flourishing as grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. From the grand and lofty to the myriad forms below, from the tiniest crawling insects to the subtlest stirrings, all are encompassed within the utmost void, their profound and wondrous workings beyond comprehension. This is what is called the Dao, the Principle.\n\nWere the Dao not so vast, the Principle not so refined, how could it govern such supremely subtle and wondrous mechanisms? Thus it encompasses heaven and earth, engenders and nurtures the myriad things, fulfilling the Dao of participation and assistance.\n\nTherefore, those who know the Dao do not observe things but observe the heart-mind. For the heart-mind governs nature and emotions, and the Principle resides within it; *qi* is bound to form, both flowing from the mandate of heaven. Called \"numinous emptiness,\" \"Supreme Ultimate,\" \"the Center,\" or \"the One,\" these are the heart-mind’s original state—thus the heart-mind is the Supreme Ultimate.

      "translated_text": "The profusion and flux of the myriad things are but the dregs and embers of *qi*. Both humans and the ten thousand things dwell together in the Void. Yet within the minute compass of a square inch, the heart-mind can fill the vastness of the cosmos and encompass the multitude of things, moving in tandem with heaven and earth without discord—this is because when the heart-mind is empty, the ten thousand existences are all contained therein.\n\nWhy should joy and anger, delight and sorrow, fleeting pleasure and gain or loss suffice to obstruct our emptiness or block our thoroughfare? When emptiness prevails, its function is effortless. As my *Laozi* says: \"The Dao is hollow, yet its use is inexhaustible; profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\" \"Hollow\" is but another name for emptiness. *Zhuangzi* says: \"Only the Dao abides in emptiness.\" *Liezi* says: \"Emptiness finds its proper dwelling, for only emptiness can contain.\" When the Dao gathers, spirit congeals; when spirit congeals, *qi* transforms; when *qi* transforms, it becomes one with the Great Void, flows in unison with heaven and earth, and the two *qi* and five phases circulate through the six directions, ceaselessly coming and going—all in harmonious interplay, sharing the same function.\n\nIf one empties the heart-mind of contentious thoughts and preserves it with unity, then within it is empty yet not full, outwardly it is clear yet not stagnant—deep as an abyss, bright as a mirror. Thus one’s inherent nature aligns with the virtue of heaven, and how could it not be the ancestor of the myriad things? Therefore, in nurturing its substance, one discards ornamentation, forgets self and other, severs defilements, and exhausts the work of attaining emptiness and preserving stillness—thereby returning to life and reverting to the root, deepening the root and securing the stem, cleansing the mirror of the mysterious. Embracing the One and guarding the Center, the Valley Spirit endures; thoughts are purified, desires diminished; emptiness reaches its extreme, stillness its utmost—one returns to the Limitless. Then emptiness and quiescence become luminous and penetrating, and things no longer enslave us but are enslaved by us.\n\nIn fulfilling its function, one casts off the limbs and body, sets aside cleverness and brilliance, takes the fundamental as essence, the external as coarse, inquiry as the root, and restraint as the guiding principle—thus nothing remains to be seen. Before heaven and earth, at the beginning of *qi*, form, and substance, there were the Great Beginning, the Great Commencement, and the Great Simplicity—the primordial Kunlun of chaos. When clarity and turbidity separated, essence emerged and radiated, measuring things and bestowing life: essence became the Three Luminaries, the sun and moon the Five Phases; phases gave rise to emotions, emotions to the marrow within, the marrow to spirit and illumination, spirit and illumination to virtue and power, and virtue and power to patterns and ornamentation. The yang does not stir without giving rise to its teachings; the yin does not rest without accomplishing its transformations.\n\nApplied to governing the state and cherishing the people, entrusted to the world, it renders the world clear and upright. All this takes non-action and tranquility as its foundation, humility and restraint as its root—is this not the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingship? Yet within the formless and boundless, all is the function of the heavenly Dao. Here there are mutual stirring and engendering, mutual overthrow and shaping, mutual reliance and concealment—ineffable, unfathomable. Is this not the spirit’s boundlessness, the *Yijing*’s formlessness? Yet the mechanisms of heaven and earth, the reckonings of things and affairs, can be foreknown and hidden away. From emptiness comes numinosity, and spirit operates within, unfolding its knowledge. Though there be myriad changes and transformations, all emerge from this.\n\nOnly by serving heaven with sincerity, nurturing life with harmony, and benefiting things with compassion does the burden of heaven respond without distinction. There is no exalted deed difficult to practice, no extraordinary discourse to delight in. Why speak of cunning, deceit, or divine marvels? It is simply a matter of harmonizing *qi* with emptiness and following things as they are. Of those who applied this and saw results: Guangcheng instructed the Yellow Emperor, Cao Shen heeded Gaitong, the Yellow Stone admonished the Marquis of Liu, and the Han governed through tranquility. Some say they appropriated this to advance their own schemes, seeking personal gain without regard for righteousness—this is perhaps an overstatement.\n\nYet history records that Huang-Lao and the Legalists, with recluses offering unrestrained critiques, blended Lao-Zhuang with Guan-Yan, and from this emerged Shen Buhai, Han Fei, Tian Pian, Shen Dao, Zou Yan, Sunzi, Shang Yang, Lü Buwei, Chao Cuo, and Chun Yu—later degenerating into the stratagems of Su Qin, Zhang Yi, Gan Mao, and Cai Ze, causing grievous harm. It is not merely that their emptiness and annihilation were pathological; rather, during the Wei-Jin period, Liu, Ruan, Wang, and He engaged in lofty but reckless discourse, subverting ethics. Han Yu called it worse than Yang Zhu and Mo Di, claiming Lao-Zhuang caused ruin. How could those who study this not drown in bias and lose themselves in excess, ultimately inviting collapse? How could they avoid the world’s censure and reproach? Their harm was even greater than that of the Legalists and unrestrained critics!\n\nNevertheless, one must examine it with precision and seek it with restraint. Only then can one know the vastness and breadth of the Lao-Zhuang Dao. Alas, the Dao is one—its subtle, wondrous, and penetrating essence, the marvel of spirit’s response to the infinitesimal—how could it be divided in two? Moreover, within the profound and obscure lies essence; within the vague and indistinct lies form. Within my central yellow shoulder, inner emptiness and outer harmony flow through the four limbs and unite with the hundred spirits. The five *qi* congeal and spread, merging with the vigorous and compliant virtues of heaven and earth.\n\nIts essentials lie in unifying one’s nature, nurturing one’s *qi*, roaming the beginning and end of the myriad things, and securing the preservation of pure *qi*. As Master Sima said: \"The myriad things all originate from the Void, are born of *qi*; *qi* forms the body, the body receives nature, nature distinguishes names, names establish conduct, and conduct awaits destiny. Thus the Void is the storehouse of things.\" This is what he meant by the Void. The operation of the Void begins with the five phases: one and six placed behind, two and seven placed before, three and eight placed to the left, four and nine placed to the right, circulating through fifty-five phases—this is what is called \"the Void’s profound mystery.\"",

Only by maintaining emptiness within can one fathom the divine and comprehend transformation, thereby attaining the Dao of tracing origins and returning to endings. As for refining the corporeal soul, expelling the void to master *qi*, riding the uprightness of heaven and earth, and harnessing the fluctuations of the six *qi*; roaming the eight directions in spirit, transcending the posterior heaven to reach the end, exhausting the boundless cycles of worldly change; roaming the mind in tranquility, merging *qi* with the vastness—thus surpassing the primal state of chaos and soaring beyond the primordial mist: gazing through the ages as if in a single breath, viewing life and death as but morning and evening. Like the cicada’s molt, like the breath’s exhalation. Before the beginning of heaven and earth, after their end—all is the operation of my emptiness. How can this be compared to those who cling to life, grasp at things, and refuse transformation?\n\nIf one merely steals fame and seizes reputation in their time, their obscuration by deceit and entanglement in excess, their ceaseless toil and anxious striving—how do they differ from dust and chaff? They are but thieves of names and usurpers of praise. Alas! To know the attainment of emptiness is to be enlightened; enlightenment leads to purity, purity to penetration, penetration to the divine. Divinity achieves speed without haste, arrival without movement—responding to all, reaching all. Otherwise, how can one be deemed a true student of our Old Master? Who can speak of the ultimate emptiness with such as these?\n\n**Vigilance in Foundations**\nLearning must have a foundation—this is what is meant by \"ordering the world and transcending it.\" If learning is not directed toward what is essential, it cannot be deemed worthy of aspiration.

It is the Way of virtue and power, nature and destiny, benevolence and righteousness.\n\nAt the dawn of the Three Dynasties, the Dao resided in Tang and Yu. Later speakers of the Dao invariably pointed to this. For the Dao was luminous under the Three Sovereigns, virtue resplendent under the Five Emperors, and laws perfected under the Three Kings. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu as rulers fulfilled the Dao of rulership; Gaoyao, Yi, Fu, Zhou, and Shao as ministers fulfilled the Dao of ministership; Confucius, Yan, Zeng, Zisi, and Mencius as teachers fulfilled the Dao of teaching. What has been modeled for ten thousand generations remains unchanged.\n\nThe sages and worthies are distant, yet their Dao endures in the Six Classics. The *Book of Changes* illuminates yin and yang, deducing the transformations of creation; the *Book of Songs* guides human nature and emotions, distinguishing the orthodoxy and heterodoxy of *feng* and *ya*; the *Book of Documents* records governance and affairs, chronicling the continuities and reforms of decrees; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* demonstrates rewards and punishments, clarifying the hierarchy of honoring kings and restraining hegemons; the *Book of Rites* refines ritual and decorum, elucidating the distinctions of rank and duty; the *Book of Music* harmonizes *qi* and connection, attaining the harmony of heaven and earth. All the essentials of the sages’ transmission of the mind and imparting of the Dao are fully contained herein—nothing surpasses this.\n\nYet the profound subtleties of the Six Classics are all present; how could our minds, luminous and clear, not derive them from this? From Yao and Shun onward, the transmission was simply to \"hold the center and maintain reverence,\" to dwell in the mind. Confucius spoke of benevolence, Zisi of sincerity, the *Great Learning* of reverence, Mencius of the mind, and the *Doctrine of the Mean* of the center—all converge as one. To achieve the work of unifying heaven and humanity is to attain centrality and harmony, preserve sincerity and clarity, exhaust the principles of things, and fulfill the natures of beings. Only then can one assist heaven and earth in their positions, nurture the myriad things, regulate the Dao of heaven and earth, and aid the suitability of heaven and earth. Thus, wisdom encompasses the myriad things, and the Dao aids the world. This is the Dao of the noble person: rooted in the self, verified among the people, examined in the Three Kings, established in heaven and earth, tested by ghosts and spirits, and awaited by a hundred generations of sages without doubt.\n\nTo establish the ultimate for heaven and earth, to establish destiny for the people, to uphold the constants, and to support the teachings of the world—steadfast and unyielding. Guarding it as the great constant, practicing it as the great law; manifest as ritual and music, hidden as ghosts and spirits—it cannot be abandoned for a single day or separated for a moment. One must devote oneself to the work of vigilance, reverence, and awe in the moments of solitary reflection and the junctures of action and restraint, so that the body is established and its function enacted.\n\nFirst, cessation leads to stability; stability to stillness; stillness to peace; peace to contemplation; contemplation to attainment. Over time, even the obscure can achieve sincerity; sincerity takes form; form becomes manifest; manifestation becomes luminous; luminosity moves; movement transforms; transformation evolves—all derived from the self. Is this not the fulfillment of nature and destiny, dwelling in benevolence and following righteousness? Gathered, it retreats into secrecy; applied, it serves the world and the state in small matters, and governs the world and the state in great ones.\n\nThe teachings of Xun, Yang, Dong, Han, Zhou, Cheng, Shao, Zhang, Zhu, and Lü all carry the Dao, serving as wings to the Classics. The writings of Zuo, Qu, Jia, Sima, Li, Liu, Ouyang, Su, Zeng, and Wang—all composed to express the Dao, not merely to convey it. Without the Dao, however skillful, they are of no value. Thus, when cultivated as virtue and conduct, and expressed as literature, all align with the true Dao.\n\nYet since the Qin and Han dynasties, there have been studies of memorization, literary composition, and cunning schemes—each distinct, yet none approaching the learning of the sages and worthies. Their words aim to benefit ten thousand generations and leave an indelible legacy. Exhausting the greatness of heaven and earth, one knows not its limit; harmonizing the balance of yin and yang, one knows not its truth; plumbing the depths of ghosts and spirits, one knows not its secrecy. How can mere ornamentation, embellishment, plagiarism, or ostentation—designed to astonish the world and impress the vulgar—suffice? Without seeking true knowledge and practical realization, how can one determine the right course in action and speech, silence and stillness?",

      "translated_text": "Here Confucius and Mencius traversed the states, seeking to put their Dao into practice. When the Dao could not be realized, they withdrew to cultivate their own integrity, thus preserving the balance between engagement and retreat. Therefore, those who withdraw to distant heights, aspiring to transcend illusion and rise above the dust of the world, must seek the Dao that transcends the mundane—this is what we call the teaching of Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nLaozi first served as the Archivist of Zhou beneath the pillars, later becoming the Keeper of the Royal Archives. He composed the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls, expounding the Dao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness. Those who shared Laozi’s path included Taigong, who instructed King Wen; Guan Yin, who served as magistrate; Kang Cang, who dwelt in Mount Weilei; Zhuangzi, who governed the Lacquer Garden; and Liezi, who resided in the gardens of Zheng. Like the lofty recluses Chao Fu and Xu You, the pure Boyi and Shuqi, and the hidden Shang Hao, they held fast to their principles without bending. To them, fame was but a guest to reality; they would rather dwell in filth than be adorned like sacrificial oxen. Daily they embraced jars and carried reeds, content in their lot—whether noble or base, joyful or sorrowful, gaining or losing—nothing could burden their hearts. Thus, with single-minded focus, they entered the center of the ring and responded to the boundless. They could govern heaven and earth, store all things, take heaven and earth as their great furnace and creation as their great bellows. The cosmos was too narrow to measure their breadth, thunder too feeble to match their spirit, rivers and seas too shallow to plumb their depth, mountains and peaks too low to rival their height, ghosts and spirits too dim to fathom their mystery. They straightened crookedness into benevolence, trod the forked path as righteousness, let flow what was scattered as joy, and plucked what was obscure as ritual. They equated life and death, harmonized self and other, defied poverty and success, and stood alone in their singular way, unwavering.\n\nThus, the Three Powers were unified, the myriad things made equal, the principles of things mastered, and forms and vessels given abode. Governing the world was as effortless as shaping clay. In non-action, they used the world with ease; in action, they were used by the world and found it insufficient. They regarded life as an excrescence, death as the bursting of a boil, and external things as mere attachments—thus aligning with those free from desire. Their words abounded in parables and grand discourses, unbridled and vast. Yet in stillness, they were sages; in motion, they were kings. Still, they shared the virtue of yin; in motion, they rode the waves of yang. Their movement was like heaven, their stillness like earth; they commanded the transformations of things while guarding their essence. Those confined within form and qi could not disturb their constancy beyond it. In harmony with the harmony of heaven, attuned to the joy of heaven, resting in the balance of heaven, and flowing with the natural division of heaven, they entrusted themselves to the myriad transformations, roaming alone in the celestial realm—thus preserving their heavenly integrity. Had they not embodied the boundless and wandered without trace, becoming companions of heaven, how could they have achieved this?\n\nTo them, the paths of chariots and carriages, the realms of fame and profit, were as nothing. They did not flaunt falsehoods to delude the world, nor parade their conduct to mislead the masses, seeking to be seen as proud or eccentric. Such was their Dao. Yet later scholars, failing to seek the root of Dao and virtue or the foundation of nature and destiny, instead indulge in base, deluded, and absurd practices, hoping to glimpse the primordial chaos of the Great Beginning—how could they possibly succeed?\n\nConsider the humble worm that feeds on petals, nests in thistles, wears a sorrowful countenance, and lives meagerly, starving its body and fraying its garments, so that others can scarcely bear the sight. Its dwelling is shared with woodcutters and herdsmen, deer and swine; its joy lies in mist and clouds, fish and birds. Its heart is like dead ashes, its form like withered wood. It holds itself in high esteem, regards itself from afar, and treats itself with gravity—how could mere worldly splendor move it in the slightest? Even if one arrived with a team of four horses and a chest of gold, it could not be reached. If forced to approach, it would vanish in an instant, leaving no trace, no lingering form. When the Dao aligned, it remained; when the Dao departed, it left—content with what it inherently possessed. How could lavish offerings, ornate dwellings, or positions of power ever bind or constrain it? These are the lofty ones of the world—the followers of Jie Yu and He Xian.\n\nYet those who feign such ways to curry favor with the world are different. In retreat, they are reckless; in advancement, they are aggressive, seeking fame and fleeting praise. Rising suddenly from obscurity, they abandon their principles at the first opportunity, indulging in extravagance—refining their attire, savoring fine foods, swelling with arrogance, boasting in speech, filling their retinues with ostentation, and adorning their dwellings with splendor. Their companions are the eminent and powerful; their attendants scurry about, vying to be their peers. With darting glances and haughty airs, they proclaim to the crowd: \"Behold, this is the Dao, this is virtue, the essence of learning, the spirit of cultivation—who would not revere and exalt it?\" Yet what drives their scramble and competition is power, profit—what do they know of Dao and virtue?\n\nAlas, those who adorn reality with false names—why not simply seize the world’s clamor and exclusion? They seek to deceive the age and please the times. Who knows that even if they dazzle for a moment, their delusions will ultimately be exposed? How could they ever earn the trust of later generations? This is precisely what those of true Dao do not do.\n\nI fear that the decline of customs and the vulgarity of mores will flow unchecked, resist all restraint, and grow ever more rampant—all because people fail to guard the root. Moreover, when the noble person errs in engagement or withdrawal, speech or silence, straying from righteousness and the Dao, how grievous and perverse it becomes! Can one not be cautious?\n\nTo know what to guard is to unite the Dao in oneness. To abandon this is to render all learning meaningless.",

      "translated_text": "Someone asked in profound inquiry: What does the Daoist school mean by \"profound\" (xuan)?\n\nAnswer: \"Profound\" refers to Heaven. It is the great origin of the Dao that issues from Heaven.\n\nQuestion: Does this not begin with Laozi’s phrase \"profound and yet more profound\"?\n\nAnswer: Precisely. I have heard from historians that the Daoist school enables one to unify spirit and focus, to move in accord with the formless, and to embrace the myriad things. In its practice of self-preservation, it follows the great harmony of yin and yang, adopts the virtues of Confucianism and Mohism, and distills the essentials of the School of Names and Legalism. Adapting to the times and responding to change, it establishes customs and implements affairs with perfect appropriateness—its principles concise and easy to grasp, its efforts minimal yet its achievements vast.\n\nAs for the essentials of the great Dao: it discards aggressiveness and desire, rejects cunning and cleverness. If one abandons these and relies on self-preservation, there is nothing to be gained. It is also said: The Daoist school practices non-action yet leaves nothing undone. Its reality is easy to practice, though its words are difficult to comprehend. Its self-preservation is rooted in emptiness and non-being, and its function lies in following the natural course. Without fixed power or constant form, it can thoroughly investigate the nature of the myriad things. It does not precede things, nor does it follow them—yet it can serve as the master of all things. This is why the Grand Historian placed the Yellow Emperor and Laozi before the Six Classics.\n\nLaozi lived at the end of the Zhou dynasty and once served as Archivist beneath the Pillars. As the Zhou declined, he composed the *Upper* and *Lower Classics* and then withdrew into reclusion. His disciples included Guan Yin, Kang Cang, Zhuangzi, and Liezi, all of whose teachings fundamentally aimed at cultivating the Dao and virtue, preserving life and destiny. Internally, one cultivates by embracing the One and guarding the center to preserve life; externally, one acts without contention or striving to benefit others. Only by abiding in great harmony, moving in accord with nature, being cautious within and inquiring without, and maintaining purity without admixture can one attain stillness and unity without change, resting in boundless tranquility. When in motion, one follows the movement of Heaven, thereby aligning with Heaven’s virtue.\n\nThough engaged in the world, one employs compassion, frugality, humility, and restraint, ensuring that one’s actions do not exceed what is necessary. Firmly guarding withdrawal and concealment, one does not act for the sake of things, returning instead to emptiness, simplicity, purity, stillness, non-action, softness, and plainness. Thus, when the world’s things are based in humility, they remain unburdened; when they contain emptiness, they encounter no obstacles; when they proceed with ease, they face no difficulties; and when they adapt with flexibility, they meet no blockages. The people are thus enabled to transform themselves, return to simplicity, and rectify themselves.\n\nThe aim is to preserve the original nature of things and return to the primordial unity. Therefore, it does not cling to the entanglements of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, governance, education, or custom—yet this is not to say these are incompatible with the world. Indeed, when the Zhou declined and customs grew shallow, the Daoists sought to remedy corruption and save the age, restoring it to pure antiquity. They adopted the virtues of Confucianism and Mohism.\n\nConfucius once inquired of Laozi about ritual. Laozi said: \"Those who are keenly perceptive and deeply discerning yet near to death are those who delight in criticizing others. Those who are broadly learned and far-reaching in argument yet endanger themselves are those who expose the faults of others.\" This is what Confucius meant by being broadly learned in antiquity and knowledgeable of the present—words he heard from the venerable Laozi.\n\nWhen Yangzi rejected universal love, he met Laozi and abandoned his contentiousness to yield his seat. When Mozi advocated uniformity and the worship of spirits, his teachings bore some resemblance to Daoism, and the works of Zhuangzi and Liezi further blended these ideas. The School of Names, in governing the state and commanding armies, valued worthy men and cherished the people, approaching Daoist thought. The School of Vertical and Horizontal Alliances, in its strategies of expansion and contraction, strength and weakness, gain and loss, also bore similarities. Yet none have endured as long or served as the foundation of the Dao like the practices of unifying spirit, embracing the myriad things, discarding aggressiveness and desire, and rejecting cunning and cleverness—all of which take emptiness and non-being as their root.\n\nIf one is without desire and returns to simplicity, without pretense yet trustworthy, blunting sharpness, resolving entanglements, harmonizing light with dust, placing oneself last yet coming first, and setting oneself aside yet enduring—then one can bend to preserve the whole, straighten the crooked, know fullness yet guard humility, and know the new yet preserve the old. Thus, one may be bright yet appear dim, advance yet seem to retreat, eloquent yet appear inarticulate, skillful yet seem clumsy, and upright yet appear bent. Without cutting away one’s square edges or defiling one’s integrity, one may be direct yet not unrestrained, radiant yet not dazzling, thereby preserving one’s efficacy.\n\nIf one acts with sincerity, proceeds with simplicity, responds with forgiveness, and answers with silence, regarding worldly affairs as coarse traces and emptiness as the wondrous function—then the Confucians, with their parables and fanciful discourses, may dismiss these as absurd and impractical, unsuited to worldly use. Nevertheless, such teachings do not depart from the principles of the Three Powers, the order of the myriad things, the constancy of life and death, or the external traces of affairs. They truly reveal what lies beyond the Six Directions, before Heaven and Earth, gathering the ten thousand existences into a single breath and dispersing a single breath into the ten thousand existences.\n\nThis is called \"serene quiescence,\" \"profound depth,\" \"lucid clarity,\" \"empty sameness,\" and \"obscure darkness.\" Truly, it is vast and boundless, wandering in the Great Beginning. Moreover, the movements of Heaven and Earth: the light and pure that rise and float are accumulations of qi; the heavy and turbid that sink and settle are accumulations of earth. Circulating through the Six Voids, they come and go without end, expanding and contracting, advancing and retreating, hard and soft, flowing through day and night, alternating with the four seasons. Wind and thunder shape forms, the myriad beings emerge and grow, self-generating and self-transforming, self-forming and self-coloring, self-dissolving and self-ceasing. The ten thousand things intermingle in chaos yet remain undivided; their black forms and material qualities all contain the essence of Heaven and Earth and are transformed into life.\n\nThus, they are constantly generating and constantly transforming without cease. Their alternations of darkness and light, their succession without a moment’s difference—this is why one transcends Heaven and Earth, leaves the myriad things behind, escapes the confines of principle and qi, and enters the boundless, traceless origin of creation. It cannot be measured by sound or scent, nor sought through images or numbers. Obscure, indistinct, and imperceptible, it transcends the ten thousand things and serves as their root—how could it not be the most profound and subtle?\n\nWhen Yang Xiong spoke of the \"profound,\" he aligned it with the numbers of the *Book of Changes*, establishing the divisions of regions, states, districts, and households—this was merely one aspect of calendrical studies, not what I call the profound.",

      "translated_text": "Sima Qian said: Those who study Laozi disparage the Confucians, while those who study the Confucians likewise disparage Laozi—why must they mutually ridicule one another so fiercely? Yet the excellence of the profound and empty lies precisely in this: later followers who took it as their creed erred into absurdity, bias, and distortion. Could this truly be the fault of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nThe true learner must therefore seek the root of emptiness and nothingness—this is what I call the profound. Someone asked: When you speak of the profound, you seem to ground it in reality, yet the classics all speak of it as existing before Heaven and Earth, humbling the cosmos, disparaging hegemonic ways, and exalting the kingly Dao. What they value is turning inward to seek within oneself, cultivating the self to enrich life, transcending form to leave illusion behind—then spiritual transformation becomes unfathomable, and one outlives Heaven to endure. How does this differ from the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi?\n\nI reply: The Dao is one and the same—how could there be any distinction between emptiness and fullness, reality and unreality? I have examined the records and texts, and they do not deceive. Laozi’s transmission takes the *Daode*’s two chapters as its foundation. Later followers either err through杂乱杂糅 or through wild exaggeration. When they speak of \"inner sageliness and outer kingship,\" they do not lack the art of ruling as a sovereign, but merely apply it differently. In cultivation, they speak of the Valley Spirit and the Mysterious Female, of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, of preserving the center and embracing the One, of abiding in harmony—nothing more.\n\nLater proponents of these teachings inevitably distinguish between the true and the false, the orthodox and the heterodox. The *Yinfu Jing*’s teachings on cultivating the self and governing the world align with the *Daode Jing*. The *Longhu Shangjing*’s text accords with the *Cantong Qi* of the Stone Wall. Yet those who study Laozi—what path could they follow if not that of immortality? Their \"inner elixir\" invariably takes spirit and qi as its foundation, while their \"outer elixir\" invariably takes lead and mercury as its essence. The Golden Liquor shares the same path as Heaven and Earth’s creation, for the Spirit Chamber is the pivot of the elixir, and the sun’s essence and moon’s marrow are the true lead and mercury.\n\nYang ascends and yin descends, never straying from the directions of *zi* and *wu*; the sun departs and the moon arrives, necessarily dwelling in the positions of *mao* and *you*. The Yang Fire rises from *zi* and ascends to *si*, where yang reaches its peak and yin is born at *wu*. The Yin Talisman descends from *wu* to *hai*, where yin reaches its peak and yang is reborn at *zi*. Within the Spirit Chamber, a hollow space an inch in diameter and round in height unites the Three Powers—this is the central crucible of our being. Emerging from yin and entering yang generates true mercury; refining the Mysterious Essence within causes fire to arise from *kan* and water to descend from *li*.\n\nThus, *kan* and *li* take north and south as their warp, cinnabar and mercury being their alternate names. Only water and fire serve as the functions of *qian* and *kun*—these are the two functions of metal and earth. When it speaks of \"three, five, and one,\" the essence of Heaven and Earth, following the Three-in-One yields its principle: the three and five guard one another, and metal and fire mutually circulate. Cinnabar is born within true lead, and metal-fire is true lead itself. Thus the scriptures say: \"Lead is the essence of metal; water is the pivot of the Dao.\" The *Cantong Qi* likewise states: *Qian* and *kun* stand above and below, while *kan* and *li* ascend and descend between them. *Kan*’s *wu* is the moon’s essence; *li*’s *ji* is the sun’s light. The Five Phases serve as the warp, with *kan*’s male metal-essence and *li*’s female fire-light—both reside in the central palace.\n\nEarth’s virtue arises from *zhen* and fills at *qian*, passing through *xun* to wane and reaching *kun* to be exhausted. Moreover, the mutual restraint of being and non-being: the white is metal’s essence, the black is water’s foundation. Metal is water’s mother, the mother concealing the child’s embryo; water is metal’s child, the child hidden in the mother’s womb. When metal returns to its original nature, it is water and metal restoring their nature. For cinnabar is the essence of wood, and when it obtains metal, they unite. Once metal and water merge, wood and fire take the lead. Metal and wood intertwine, water and earth pair to form the elixir.\n\nAs for the \"medicinal substances\": *Qian*’s yang generates *kun*, and *kun*’s yin envelops *qian*. *Qian*’s metal generates *kun*’s earth, symbolizing *qian*’s central line dwelling within *kun*—this is metal and water sharing the same origin. Symbolizing *kun*’s central line dwelling within *qian* is wood and fire sharing the same position. *Qian* and *kun* lodge their bodies within *kan* and *li*, and *kan* and *li* become the functions of *qian* and *kun*. Fire’s completion number is seven, returning to reside in the east’s *zhen* as the Seven Returns. Metal’s completion number is nine, returning to reside in the north’s *kan* as the Nine Reversions. Thus fire is refined by earth, and metal enters to become water, enclosing and flying, congealing and opening the numinous gate.\n\nYet the elixir must be formed by refining lead with fire. As for the \"fire times\": the movement of the Dipper’s pivot and the bell’s pitch are based on the numbers of nine and one, combining the numbers of two, six, three, and nine. The end necessarily returns to the beginning, embracing the origin and holding the true, sowing essence at *zi*. *Yin* and *shen* are the extremes of yin and yang. The method of counting the stalks divides the month into twelve hexagrams, each hexagram receiving two and a half days. Each uses its own hexagram’s lines to perform its own hexagram’s counting. From the *guan* hexagram of the eighth month to the *tai* hexagram of the first month, yang uses the young twenty-eight stalks, and yin uses the old twenty-four stalks. From the *dazhuang* hexagram of the fourth month to the *pi* hexagram of the seventh month, yang uses the old thirty-six stalks, and yin uses the young twenty-two stalks. Twelve hexagrams complete one month’s work; twelve months complete one year’s cycle. Repeating and circulating, there is no excess or deficiency.\n\nThis aligns with Master Shao’s *Xiantian Tu*, both following Fu Xi’s arrangement of the *Yi*’s images and positions. Thus the marvel of the Heavenly Root and Lunar Grotto: yang begins at *fu* and culminates at *qian*; yin arises at *gou* and culminates at *kun*. Cycling through the sixty-four hexagrams, there is not the slightest deviation. This is how it smelts and nurtures the ten thousand kinds, beginning and ending without form, merging with the Great Thoroughfare, and blending into obscurity.\n\nTherefore, it is profoundly vast and cannot be considered external; minutely divided, it cannot be considered internal. Yet it does not transgress the Dao.",

Obscure, indistinct, and imperceptible, it transcends the ten thousand things and serves as their root—how could it not be the most profound and subtle?\n\nWhen Yang Xiong spoke of the \"profound,\" he aligned it with the numbers of the *Book of Changes*, establishing the divisions of regions, states, districts, and households—this was merely one aspect of calendrical studies, not what I call the profound.",

      "translated_text": "The theory of *na jia* assigns fixed positions: *qian* governs *jia* and *ren*, *kun* governs *yi* and *gui*, *zhen* governs *geng*, *xun* governs *xin*, *gen* governs *bing*, and *dui* governs *ding*. Yet *kan* governs *wu* and *li* governs *ji*, which have no fixed positions. Moreover, the yin and yang of the six hexagrams are but the circulating ascent and descent of the central lines of *kan* and *li*. As Master Zhu observed: these are but provisional devices to embody the rhythms of advance and retreat—well said. Thus the composition of the *Huoji* has its basis.\n\nLater generations, misled by metaphors of cinnabar and mercury, divided the art into \"inner\" and \"outer\" elixirs, each claiming textual authority to dazzle the world. Yet how could one wholly rely on herbs, minerals, or metals to achieve the mechanism of divine transformation? As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Borrowing the names of stones, cloaking itself in borrowed texts.\" Though rarely discussed by the masters, it concerns nothing other than the cultivation of *xing* (nature), *ming* (life), *shen* (spirit), and *xuan* (mystery). To exhaust the supreme principles of yin and yang, to seize the divine power of creation—is this not the culmination of the elixir path?\n\nThe metaphors of the elixir are but borrowed images—what need is there for terms like furnace and cauldron, fire and medicine, lead and mercury, dragon and tiger, infant and maiden, female and male? Yet texts like the *Guanyin* speak of \"infant and alchemical maiden,\" \"golden tower and crimson palace,\" \"azure dragon and white tiger,\" \"precious tripod and red furnace,\" and \"clay idols\"—such language did not exist in the time of Laozi. Some call these apocryphal works. Those who cling to images and obscure texts, abandoning the source to chase the stream, indulging in the bizarre and fantastical to impress the world, utter only the words of charlatans and eccentrics—men like Shaojun, Ledao, Wencheng, Wuli, and Gongsun. Works like the *Baopuzi*’s alchemical transformations, which rely on heterodox methods to deceive the masses and seek fleeting fortune, inevitably lead to ruin through reckless falsehoods.\n\nAlas! Those who speak well of immortality say only: \"See nothing, hear nothing, embrace the spirit in stillness.\" Thus one forgets the form to nurture *qi*, forgets *qi* to nurture the spirit, and forgets the spirit to nurture emptiness. He who holds to the Dao attains complete virtue; with complete virtue, the form is whole; with the form whole, *qi* is whole—I cannot alter this. When emptiness reaches its extreme, numinous clarity arises; with numinous clarity, divine transformation occurs, and one becomes a companion of Heaven, roaming the origins of things.\n\nThe light and pure *qi* ascends, and the essence of utmost yang rises with it. Some say: \"The sage does not follow the path of immortals\"—is this not a slander against the world? To seek the Dao, one must only guard the center. If asked: \"Is guarding the center not sufficient for the elixir? Why then are teachings so varied, with countless methods and divergent paths? Can guarding the center alone suffice, or must one rely on external techniques?\" The answer is: Is the Dao divided in two?\n\nHeaven is the accumulation of *qi*; the Supreme Lord is the sovereign of Heaven. From the undifferentiated state before the separation of the Hongyuan, the Three *Xuan* gave rise to existence—these are Fan Qingjing and Xuan Yuanshi. The wondrously non-existent is the origin of *xing*; the wondrously existent is the origin of *xuan*. From the Three *Xuan* arise the Nine *Xuan*—these are the Nine Heavens. The realm of emptiness is boundless; the light and pure *qi* has no form, and the governing spirit has no fixed abode. Yet because the governed have their dependencies, scriptures and records descend to instruct, talismans and methods unfold to elucidate, and thus the teachings are established.\n\nAmong the most prominent transmitters are the Han Celestial Master, the Mao Perfected Lords, Xu Jingyang, Ge the Immortal Elder, and Qiu the Perfected Lord. The Three Caverns and Four Supplements, along with the schools of Qingwei, Lingbao, Shenxiao, and Deng-Yue, are the categories of the Caverns and Supplements—these are the scriptures and records. Qingwei originated with Yuanshi and was expounded by Zhenyuan; later, Wei of Nanyue and Zu of Lingjun carried on the lineage of the four branches. Those who propagated its teachings include Zhu Dongyuan, Li Shaowei, Nan Bidao, Huang Leiyuan, and Li Xuji, followed by Zhang, Xu, Ye, and Xiong, whose influence spread further.\n\nLingbao began with Yuchen, based on the *Duren Jing* and its methods, and was expounded by the Three Perfected Ones of Xuanyi. Later, Xu of Taiji, Zheng of Zhuyang, and Lu of Jianji promoted its teachings. Those who propagated it include Tian Zijin, Yu Dongwei, Du Dazhen, Xiang Deqian, Wang Qingjian, Jin Yunzhong, Gao Ziyuan, Du Guangting, Kou Qianzhi, and Liu Chongjing, followed by Zhao, Lin, Bai, and Chen, whose influence likewise spread—though distinctions arose between the Donghua and Nanchang lineages.\n\nShenxiao encompasses the various Thunder lineages, originating with the Perfected King of Yuqing and expounded by the Fire Master, Perfected Lord Wang. Later, the Lords of Shichen, Xujing, and Xihe, along with Li the Demon-Queller and Xu the Pivot, promoted its teachings. Those who propagated it include Lin Lingsu, Xu Shenweng, Liu Hunkang, Lei Mo’an, Wan Wulei, Fang Pinle, Deng Tieya, followed by Shangguan, Xu, Tan, Yang, Chen, Tang, and Mo, whose influence also spread.\n\nDeng-Yue traces back to Zhu Ximing, Zheng Zhiwei, Lu Yanghao, and Ye Fashan, with those who propagated its teachings including Zuo, Zheng, Pan, and Li, whose lineages flourished further. Yet in essence, none depart from the wonders of the Three *Xuan* and Five Phases.\n\nThe scripture says: \"The Three, Five, and One are the essence of Heaven and Earth\"—these are the numbers of the *Hetu*’s Three and Five. Thus thunder and lightning combine the numbers of nine and one: yang is thunder, yin is lightning; frost arises from lightning, killing from thunder; the pivot is yin, the mechanism is yang; thunder is benevolent, lightning is malevolent—all are concealed within the Supreme Ultimate. Seeking this within the body, the shoulders are the Thunder Enclosure, the Five *Xuan* are the Five Thunders. The heart is the numinous palace, the sovereign of the five senses.",

      "translated_text": "To merge one’s own numinous essence with the wonders of the Three *Xuan* and Five Phases is to illumine the obscure and shatter the dark—this is refining utmost yin with utmost yang, illuminating utmost darkness with utmost brightness. The Southern Dipper steeps the *hun*-soul, its number the six of water. The Northern Dipper forges the *po*-soul, its number the seven of fire. Through the work of refining oneself, one refines the *hun*, gathering its scattered and benighted qi, transcending its sunk and clinging thoughts, and transforms it into the realm of yang brightness, thereby escaping the realm of yin gloom.\n\nTo command the opening and closing of yin and yang is to conjoin the essence of the Two and Five, to condense the qi of the Nine and One. Cultivated within, it is called the *elixir*; deployed without, it is called the *method*. By stirring the Five *Xuan* to excoriate and produce sound, the functions of rain and sunshine are perfected in the space of a single breath. By employing one’s own spirit to command the spirits of others, in the midst of stillness, this evokes and that responds. Thus are the deadly mechanisms of Heaven and Earth activated, the transformative controls of yin and yang conjoined—all through the power of one’s own numinous essence merging with them in virtue and penetrating the divine.\n\nTo drive out and exorcise malevolent spirits, to ward off and dispel calamities and pestilence, are but minor matters. Moreover, the ancient institutions of invoking Heaven and offering sacrifices, which later devolved into the ornate rituals of *tao* and *ci*, have existed since the time of Emperor Wu of Han. As the saying goes: \"Offerings to the Supreme Emperor, fasting and bathing in purification, to sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor—all are means to express one’s sincerity.\" Though the offerings be as humble as mugwort and reeds from the valleys, they may yet serve, for they embody sincerity. Thus it is said: \"Ghosts and spirits have no constant sustenance; they are sustained by those who attain sincerity. Millet and glutinous rice are not inherently fragrant; it is bright virtue that is fragrant.\" Strive to cultivate the resonance of virtue, that it may be offered to ghosts and spirits.\n\nIf sincerity wanes and virtue is lacking, relying merely on external adornments—embroidered silks, admired scriptures, embellished brocades, intricate patterns, lavish feasts with crossed platters, striving to dazzle the eyes and ears to impress the world and astonish the vulgar—what then is the true purpose of such affairs? Can it truly be about bells, drums, jades, and silks? The symbolic representations of the Dao are all modeled after the celestial and terrestrial deities, their radiance displayed and arrayed in order. These are the established norms, rituals, and canons, all expressions of reverence and utmost sincerity, enabling those who gaze upon and partake in the rites to be thus guided.\n\nYet later generations have acted otherwise, chasing only fame and profit, prizing only ornate embellishments, all abandoning the root to pursue the branch, forsaking the real to compete in the false. How do they differ from the greedy and flattering shamans, scheming only for mouth and body, for goods and wealth? Moreover, they exalt their esoteric chambers, differentiate their paths, and mystify their mechanisms to delude the masses and incite their kind. Those who inherit these ways become habituated to such cliques, not probing within but only dazzled by externals. How far have they strayed from the Dao! What hope is there for any resonance or communion?\n\nAlas! Though the transmissions may differ, they converge on the same path—there is no second Dao. Those who worthily inherit it must broadly study and guard its essentials, thereby resolving doubts and dispelling delusions. It is not merely about boasting of numerous fasts or extraordinary practices. Does the method not say: \"Within the real lies the divine; beyond sincerity, there is no method\"? From this perspective, does it not align with the incantations and revealed secrets?\n\nMoreover, the ancients spoke of the virtue of the master: clad in grass, fed by trees, starving their bodies, tempering their minds and spirits, purifying their qi and thoughts, so that not a shred of worldly desire or emotional filth could lodge within. Thus they regulated their externals, merging the work of Heaven and humanity into one. The divine and luminous dwelled with them; their hearts united with Heaven, so that their hearts were Heaven. Therefore, to unite Heaven with Heaven—there can be no \"that Heaven\" and \"this non-Heaven,\" no \"that mystery\" and \"this non-mystery.\" The mechanism of resonance and response is thus singular—how could there be any interval in its issuance?\n\nThis is the Way of pure simplicity: only the divine is to be guarded. Guard it without losing it, and unite with the divine. The essence of this unity penetrates, harmonizing with the heavenly order—is this not fitting? To abandon this and wallow in worldly filth, to be swept away by clamor and ostentation, to be blinded by gaudy splendor, and to take such as teachers and friends—like ants drawn to sweetness or bees swarming, proclaiming daily, \"I am an immortal! I am numinous!\"—is either perverse or delusional. How could this be what Zhuangzi meant by the *Great Master*?\n\nAlas! What the scriptures describe—without Peng and Wei, it would have nearly sunk into the realm of talismans and staves. What the methods conceal—without Wang and Bai, it would have flowed into the domain of shamans. Yet to govern Heaven and Earth, to store the myriad things, to harmonize with ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune—still, one must expand upon these words and seek within them. This is what is meant by \"conveying the mandate and penetrating the mysterious,\" which may be silently comprehended.\n\n**Explication of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate**\nThe Supreme Ultimate is the complete embodiment of the Dao. Undifferentiated and without bias, vast and without form or semblance, it is the root of nature and destiny. Nature is endowed by destiny; principle inheres in nature; the heart governs them—this is called the Dao. The body of the Dao is called the *Ultimate of Five*, residing at the center of the Nine Categories—this is the *August Ultimate*. The *Book of Changes* says, \"Converge upon what has ultimate\"; the *Book of Songs* says, \"None are not your ultimate.\" Seeking it thus, it is the heart, the Dao, the center.\n\nMaster Zhou said: \"In the center, it rests.\" Master Cheng said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is the Dao.\" Master Shao said: \"The heart is the Supreme Ultimate.\" Master Zhu said: \"The Supreme Ultimate is principle.\" Master Lu said: \"The center is the great root of the world—this is the Ultimate.\" Principle is one; when spoken of together, it is the Dao.\n\nThe Five Phases and yin-yang—yin-yang is the Supreme Ultimate. The Five are distinct, yet the Two are real; the Two and the One are fundamentally one. The Two are real: Heaven, with yang, generates the myriad things; Earth, with yin, completes the myriad things. In movement, yang; in stillness, yin. Yang transforms and yin conjoins, giving rise to the Five Qi, and from the Five Qi, the myriad things are born—hence it is said the Five are distinct. The Five are distinct yet rooted in yin and yang, which are mutually their root.\n\nThe Two Modes arise from yang, interact with yin; yin interacts with yang, giving rise to the Four Images. The Four Images divide, producing the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams intermingle, and the myriad things are born. This is called \"one movement, one stillness\"—is it not the utmost subtlety of Heaven and Earth?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the Five Qi spread, the Four Seasons proceed, and the myriad things are born in ceaseless generation. The Five Phases are but one yin-yang; yin-yang is but one Supreme Ultimate. When the Supreme Ultimate scatters to become the myriad things, each thing possesses its own nature, each contains a single Supreme Ultimate in its wholeness, with stillness ever as its master.\n\nEmbracing both being and non-being, preserving substance and function, containing movement and stillness, it is the source of all transformations and the root of all existence—wondrously uniting the essence of the Two and the Five. Master Zhu said: the Supreme Ultimate is principle; movement and stillness are qi. The Supreme Ultimate is the inherent subtlety; movement and stillness are the mechanism it rides. When the mechanism moves, qi flows and yin-yang operate—how could principle not be manifest? For qi bears principle in generation, and principle takes form through qi; nature presides as master, while yin-yang and the Five Phases interweave in warp and woof.\n\nSpoken of as one, the myriad things share a single Supreme Ultimate in their totality. Spoken of separately, each thing possesses its own Supreme Ultimate. Moreover, in the primordial chaos of the Great Vastness, primordial qi was the root of the myriad things. Its essence is called principle; its ceaseless flowing of yin and yang is called qi. Thus, before division, the Dao is the Supreme Ultimate; after formation, all things possess this principle. The mind is the Supreme Ultimate—profound and without trace, yet all principles are complete within it. Once yin and yang take form, principle and qi become distinct.\n\nWhen the Supreme Ultimate divides, it first generates one odd and one even; from odd and even, generation proceeds without end. Thus, one divides into two, two into four, four into eight, eight into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, and thirty-two into sixty-four. The sages had no means to express this until Fuxi first drew the lines: a single unbroken line to represent Qian, a broken line to represent Kun—embodying the Supreme Ultimate of our minds. One odd and one even symbolize change; layered, they form hexagrams; divided, they become lines—all the most evident and luminous subtleties of yin and yang.\n\nThis drawing is most vast, most profound, most refined, most subtle—neither visible in the semblance of qi and form, nor attainable through sound, color, shape, or appearance. Radiant and flourishing, empty yet numinous, bright yet wondrous, it scatters into the ten thousand differences and gathers into one root. Without the slightest lapse of time or hair’s-breadth of divergence, it cycles without end, boundless and inexhaustible. Like the revolutions of Heaven and Earth, the moisture of wind and rain, the might of thunder, the solemnity of frost and snow, the flow and towering of mountains and rivers, the flourishing and withering of plants and trees, the subtlety of flying and burrowing creatures, the multitude of moving and growing things—all do not transgress the flowing of Heaven’s mandate, sharing the same endowment.\n\nWhat is called \"having an ultimate\" refers to principle; \"having no ultimate\" refers to form. Yet the utmost extremity of principle is fundamentally formless. If one were to speak of it as \"non-being,\" it could not serve as the root of the myriad transformations. When Master Shao spoke of \"the Ultimateless\" and \"having images,\" \"having\" refers to its true essence as root, while \"non-being\" is its formless, odorless, and transcendent nature. Those who perceive the body of the Dao surely cannot add \"non-being\" to \"being.\"\n\nAs for Laozi’s \"Ultimateless,\" it means formless and boundless; Zhuangzi’s \"Dao exists prior to the Supreme Ultimate\" is of the same sense. As for the numbers of the Yellow River and Luo River charts and the images of the Earlier Heaven, though advance and retreat, fullness and emptiness, growth and decline operate within them, all take emptiness at the center as their ultimate. By emptying the center, the inherent subtlety of the Supreme Ultimate is attained—what difference then remains between obscurity and clarity, communication and obstruction?\n\nThus, the *Book of Changes* states: \"The learning of the mind encompasses all affairs; all transformations originate in the mind.\" What the mind possesses is the supreme principle that does not transgress Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. Master Cheng said: \"There is principle, then there are images; there are images, then there are numbers.\" The Way of humanity begins in yang and is completed in yin, rooted in stillness and flowing into movement—just as with the myriad things. Yet yang returns to its root in yin, stillness returns to its root in movement; in every movement and stillness, all flow together with Heaven and Earth. Only by mastering stillness is nature established; when nature is established, centrality and uprightness are achieved, and benevolence and righteousness are settled.\n\nThus, substance and function are one, source and manifestation are without distinction. This diagram, Master Zhu said, was received by Zhou Dunyi from Mu Bochang, who received it from Zhong Fang, who received it from Chen Tuan. Since Chen Tuan studied the teachings of Laozi, Master Lu criticized Master Zhu for deriving the Ultimateless from Laozi, while the *Book of Changes* speaks only of \"having an ultimate,\" and Zhou Dunyi’s *Comprehensive Discourse* mentions only yin-yang and the Supreme Ultimate—this is clear. Yet Master Zhu’s gloss of \"formless\" does not deviate from the Dao.\n\nMoreover, in Pan’s record, it is held without doubt that Zhou Dunyi composed it himself. Some also say that Zhou Dunyi, Hu Su, and Shao Gu studied together under a Buddhist monk in Runzhou and received it from him. Yet how could such a teaching be known to a Buddhist monk? Furthermore, earlier scholars regarded the learning of Zhou and Shao—the *Earlier Heaven* and *Supreme Ultimate* diagrams—as sharing one principle, their transmission not necessarily separate. Its essence is most great, encompassing all; its function is most divine, pervading all.\n\nThus it is said: from the hidden and manifest of Heaven and Earth to the insects and plants, nothing is too minute to accord with it. It is to follow the principles of nature and destiny, to exhaust the Way of transformation. The hearts of the sages of all ages are the same—this is not attained by seeking afar, but by returning to what is within oneself. Whether distant as the six directions or near as one’s own body, fleeting as a blink of the eye or subtle as movement and stillness—how could mere words, speech, or hearing suffice to know Heaven? One must devote oneself to the work of convergence and the subtleties of inquiry, so that the luminous and tranquil emptiness of one’s spirit fills the six directions and governs the myriad changes. With time, sincerity becomes refined, hence clarity; spirit responds, hence wonder; subtlety, hence profundity.",

      "translated_text": "The establishment of images and the depiction of ideas herein dissect and analyze the subtlest truths, leaving nothing unaddressed. The Way of nature and destiny, the discourse on life and death, the tracing of origins and the return to endings—all are fully encompassed within this.\n\nTo weigh noble rank as a mere fraction and regard gold and jade as dust—who could alter this, or dare to cast doubt? Let this resolve such questions.\n\n*On the Primordial Diagram*\nThe *Primordial Diagram* (*Xiantian Tu*) was created by Fuxi. The sequence and positions of its trigrams and lines all derive from the original drawings, unlike the later arrangement of King Wen’s post-celestial order.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"There is the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes.\" The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams. Here, yang ascends to intersect with yin, and yin descends to intersect with yang, producing the Four Images of Heaven. The firm intersects with the yielding, and the yielding intersects with the firm, producing the Four Images of Earth. The eight trigrams intermingle, and the myriad things are born therefrom.\n\nTheir numerical sequence is: Qian as one, Dui as two, Li as three, Zhen as four, Xun as five, Kan as six, Gen as seven, and Kun as eight. The Four Images intersect to form sixteen matters, and the eight trigrams intermingle to produce the sixty-four hexagrams—this is the imagery of the Primordial.\n\nAs Master Shao said: \"One divides into two, two into four, four into eight.\" From Qian to Kun, all are trigrams of the unborn. If traced in reverse, they correspond to the four seasons. The *Commentary* states: \"The *Changes* reckon in reverse\"—this is what it means.\n\nTheir positions are: Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, Kan in the west, Zhen in the northeast, Dui in the southeast, Xun in the southwest, and Gen in the northwest. From Zhen to Qian is the forward sequence; from Xun to Kun is the reverse. Yin is the mother of yang, and yang is the father of yin. The mother conceives the eldest son, giving rise to *Fu* (Return); the father begets the eldest daughter, giving rise to *Gou* (Decay). Thus, yang begins with *Fu*, and yin begins with *Tai* (Pregnancy).\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"Heaven and Earth take their positions; mountains and marshes exchange qi; thunder and wind press upon each other; water and fire do not oppose one another. The eight trigrams intermingle.\" The reckoning of what has passed follows the forward sequence, while the knowing of what is to come follows the reverse. The forward sequence, rotating left, consists of already-generated hexagrams; the reverse sequence, rotating right, consists of yet-to-be-generated hexagrams.\n\nThe sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams arises from the eight trigrams arranged in order and then doubled. Thus, the lower three lines correspond to the eight trigrams of the preceding diagram, while the upper three lines are each doubled in sequence, so that the lower trigram also extends into eight. If each line is generated in succession, it follows Master Shao’s principle: \"Eight divides into sixteen, sixteen into thirty-two, thirty-two into sixty-four.\" All are modeled upon the wonders of natural patterns.\n\nThese are the four diagrams, known as the learning of the Primordial. Yang’s nature is round; when formed, it becomes square. Yin’s nature is square; when imaged, it becomes round. In the circular arrangement, Qian reaches its limit at noon, Kun at midnight, Li at dawn, and Kan at dusk. Yang is born at midnight and culminates at noon; yin is born at noon and culminates at midnight. Here, yang resides in the south, and yin in the north.\n\nIn the square arrangement, Qian begins in the northwest, and Kun ends in the southeast. Here, yang resides in the north, and yin in the south. This is the numerical interplay of yin and yang in opposition. From Kun’s expansion, passing through Gen and Dui, it culminates in Qian; from Qian’s contraction, passing through Xun and Gen, it culminates in Kun and Zhen. At the inception of yin’s intersection, yang is born—this is Zhen and Kun’s connection to Xun. At the inception of yang’s contraction, yin is born—this is Xun and Qian’s connection to the circular diagram.\n\nThe sequence of yin and yang’s waxing and waning is as follows: Zhen has one yang, Li and Dui have two yang, and Qian has three yang; Xun has one yin, Kan and Gen have two yin, and Kun has three yin—all are the principles of nature. Their numbers proceed from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight, forming the eight trigrams. The round exterior represents yang, while the square within represents yin. The round is dynamic and becomes Heaven; the square is still and becomes Earth. Though the images of square and circle differ, their arrangement of trigrams and sequences are the same across the four diagrams.\n\nThus, it is said that this began with Fuxi, not with Master Shao. Even if Master Shao had created it himself, he would have based it upon Fuxi’s work.\n\nMoreover, the term \"Primordial\" refers to that which precedes Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose it—this is what King Wen and Confucius did not expound. Some say the Primordial is the *River Diagram*. The numbers of the *River Diagram* are: Heaven one, Earth two, Heaven three, Earth four, Heaven five, Earth six, Heaven seven, Earth eight, Heaven nine, Earth ten. The numbers of Heaven are five, and the numbers of Earth are five; the five positions interact, each having its counterpart. The numbers of Heaven total twenty-five, and the numbers of Earth total thirty—altogether, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five, which the sages took as the basis for drawing the trigrams.\n\nSome say the eight trigrams are the *River Diagram*—this is incorrect. Moreover, the sequence of the Primordial trigrams and the *River Diagram* are only half in accord. In the *River Diagram*, Qian and Kun are vertical, while the six children are horizontal—this is the origin of numbers. The Primordial cannot be spoken of in terms of numbers; its sequence and positions are all the generative numbers of the eight trigrams. Yang is one, and yin is two; thus, yang generates yin as two, and six becomes twelve. Yin generates yang as three, and ten becomes thirty. Therefore, Qian begins with one, and Dui becomes twelve; Li becomes twelve and thirty, totaling three hundred sixty; Zhen becomes twelve and four thousand three hundred twenty. From Xun to Kun, all are the generative numbers of odd and even. When refined into the sixty-four hexagrams, they are multiplied by their generated numbers to yield the total sum.\n\nFrom midnight to noon is yang: the first four lines are yang, the two lines before the middle are both yin, the two lines after are both yang, the top line is yin, and the second line is yang.",

      "translated_text": "From noon to midnight is yin: the first four lines are all yin; the two lines before the middle are yang; the two lines after are yin; the top line is yang; the second line is yin; the third line is yang; and the fourth line is yin.\n\nIn yang, the two lines at the middle and top first become yin and then yang, for yang is born of yin. In yin, the two lines at the middle and top first become yang and then yin, for yin is born of yang. That its sequence begins with Zhen and ends with Kun is because the waxing and waning of yin and yang constitute its numbers. This is what Master Cai called *Huangji Jingshi* (\"Supreme Principles Governing the World\"), all rooted in the Primordial Heaven. For all numbers arise from one, and the cyclic generative numbers of the sixty-four hexagrams—like the sun, moon, and stars; water, fire, earth, and stone; heat and cold; day and night; flying and walking creatures; grasses and trees—are allotted to the eight trigrams, yielding the numbers of ceaseless generation.\n\nThus, what responds and transforms in goodness are heat and cold, day and night, temperament and form, movement and flight, grasses and trees, colors and sounds, qi and flavors. What corresponds and transmutes in goodness are rain and wind, dew and thunder, movement and flight, grasses and trees, temperament and form, eyes and ears, nose and mouth—all the numbers of Primordial Heaven. In the governance of the world, Heaven possesses yin and yang: the Greater Yang, Greater Yin, Lesser Yang, and Lesser Yin. Earth possesses softness and hardness: the Lesser Hard, Lesser Soft, Greater Hard, and Greater Soft. These are the eight trigrams spoken of in the *Yijing*. Therefore, when yin and yang are exhausted, the four seasons are complete; when hardness and softness are exhausted, the four directions are established. The odd and even lines of Heaven and Earth, the numbers nine of yang and six of yin, all arise from the number four. This is what Master Zhu meant by viewing the myriad things as fourfold.\n\nThus, the categories of the sun, moon, and stars all emerge from the transformations of the eight trigrams. The changes of Heaven and Earth unfold through *yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi*; the changes of human affairs unfold through emperors, kings, hegemons, and lords. *Yuan*, *hui*, *yun*, and *shi* comprise spring, summer, autumn, and winter, corresponding to birth, growth, harvest, and storage. Emperors, kings, hegemons, and lords comprise the *Yijing*, *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*, corresponding to virtue, the Dao, merit, and effort. Each mutually gives rise to the other, forming sixteen. Sixteen is the number of the four images mutually generating one another. All the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the responses of the myriad things, and the continuities and changes of past and present do not exceed these sixteen. With sixteen, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is complete. This is what Master Shao meant by the supreme subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and humanity lying in the interval between movement and stillness.\n\nThis is called the learning of the Primordial Heart; the learning of the Manifested Traces follows after. Thus, all diagrams begin from the center, for the myriad transformations and affairs are born of the heart. It is also said that the *Primordial Heaven Diagram* is the circle within. Though the diagram bears no text, my words throughout the day never depart from it. For the principles of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are all contained within it. Moreover, the circle represents the numbers of the *Hetu*; the square, the patterns of the *Luoshu*. The \"juggling of pellets\" speaks of the circular images of Primordial Heaven, all following the ebb and flow of yin and yang.\n\nThe winter solstice occupies the midpoint of *zi*, where yang begins in *Fu*. The \"Moon Grotto\" is where *Qian* meets *Xun*, that is, the yang from *Fu* to *Qian*. The \"Heavenly Root\" is where *Kun* meets *Zhen*, that is, the yin from *Gou* to *Kun*. Yang governs humanity; yin governs things. Thus, the five hexagrams from *Qian* to *Xun*—that is, *Gou*—are the \"Moon Grotto\"; the five hexagrams from *Kun* to *Zhen*—that is, *Fu*—are the \"Heavenly Root.\" As for the thirty-six palaces, they accumulate the numbers from *Qian* one to *Kun* eight. The \"Heavenly Root\" corresponds to the winter solstice, midnight, what is called the heart of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOn the left, from the first line of *Zhen* is the winter solstice; the middle of *Li* and *Dui* is the spring equinox; the end of *Qian* is the summer solstice. On the right, from the first line of *Xun* is the summer solstice; the middle of *Kan* and *Gen* is the autumn equinox; reaching the end of *Kun* transitions to the winter solstice. This cycle is endless, for in one year, one month, one day, one hour, there is nowhere this principle does not reside. Its ceaseless circulation: from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin containing yang; from *Fu* to *Qian* is yang dividing yin. Between *Kun* and *Fu* lies the Wuji. From *Kun* returning to *Gou* is before the Wuji; from *Qian* connecting to *Fu* is after the appearance of images. *Qian* and *Kun* intersect to become *Tai*; *Kan* and *Li* intersect to become *Jiji*.\n\n*Qian* is born at *zi*; *Kun* is born at *wu*; *Kan* ends at *yin*; *Li* ends at *shen*, corresponding to the celestial seasons. Yin and yang arise from the two sides; the void in the center is the Taiji. From the winter solstice to the summer solstice is forward movement; from the summer solstice to the winter solstice is reverse movement. Black and white circulate within the single ring, and all becomes spring. Master Zhu said: Among the twenty-eight hexagrams of the *Yijing*, when inverted they form fifty-six hexagrams, except for *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Daguo*, *Yi*, *Xiaoguo*, and *Zhongfu*, which when inverted remain their original hexagrams. Combining the twenty-eight hexagrams with these eight yields the thirty-six palaces. These are all the marvels of the \"Heavenly Root\" and \"Moon Grotto,\" the comings and goings of their endless cycle.\n\nThis *Primordial Heaven* is the original diagram of Fuxi. Though it requires no words, its scope is vast, for every character and meaning in the *Yijing* emerges from it. In terms of its structure, the *Taiji* is not as grand or detailed as *Primordial Heaven*; in terms of its principles, *Primordial Heaven* is not as refined or concise as the *Taiji*. Yet the *Taiji* ultimately lies within the bounds of *Primordial Heaven*, for the principles of things are the same, and images and numbers are without duality.\n\nFrom the first undivided line to the completion of six lines is what is called the learning of Primordial Heaven. After the hexagrams are formed, each is expounded according to its particular meaning—this is the learning of Manifested Traces. What Master Shao called *Primordial Heaven* is the *Yijing* drawn by Fuxi; *Manifested Traces* is the *Yijing* expounded by King Wen.",

From Xun to Kun, all are the generative numbers of odd and even. When refined into the sixty-four hexagrams, they are multiplied by their generated numbers to yield the total sum.\n\nFrom midnight to noon is yang: the first four lines are yang, the two lines before the middle are both yin, the two lines after are both yang, the top line is yin, and the second line is yang.",

      "translated_text": "Fuxi’s *Yijing* originally had no text—only a single diagram to embody its images and numbers, within which the principles of Heaven and Earth and the myriad things, the transformations of yin and yang from beginning to end, were all contained. The sequence of King Wen’s eight trigrams—*Li* to the south, *Kan* to the north, *Zhen* to the east, *Dui* to the west, *Qian* to the southwest, *Kun* to the northwest, *Gen* to the southeast, and *Xun* to the northeast—represents their positions in application, the learning of Manifested Traces.\n\nThough Confucius composed the *Ten Wings* based on King Wen’s *Yijing*, within them—such as the arrangement of the eight trigrams, their doubling to form hexagrams; the *Taiji*, the Two Modes, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams; and the categories of Heaven, Earth, Mountain, Marsh, Thunder, Wind, Water, and Fire—all derive from Fuxi’s original trigrams, not taking King Wen’s expounded *Yijing* as identical to Fuxi’s initial drawings. Some say this diagram was transmitted from Chen Tuan to Mu Bochang, from Mu to Li Tingzhi, and from Li to Shao Yong, thus sharing its origins with the alchemical Dao.\n\nFrom *Fu* to *Qian* is yang; from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin. *Qian* and *Kun* establish the positions of above and below, while *Li* and *Kan* arrange the gates of left and right—where Heaven and Earth open and close, where the sun and moon enter and exit. After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice, inhalation—this is the yearly breath of Heaven and Earth. The month of the winter solstice follows the path of the summer solstice’s sun; the month of the summer solstice follows the path of the winter solstice’s sun. From spring to summer, from *Zi* to *Chen-Si*; from autumn to winter, from *Wu* to *Xu-Hai*. The four cardinal trigrams are *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The four trigrams of the female and male serve as the bolt and key.\" The numbers of *Kan* and *Li* are one and two, forming the warp of the north-south axis. *Kan* and *Li* are the true Water and Fire, the masters of the six trigrams, while the six trigrams serve *Kan* and *Li*.\n\nThe two breaths of yin and yang both originate and conclude at *Zi* and *Wu*. *Kan* conceals the six *Wu* stems as the essence of the moon, residing in the north, symbolizing the White Tiger born of water within metal. *Li* conceals the six *Ji* stems as the radiance of the sun, residing in the south, symbolizing the Vermilion Dragon born of fire within mercury. Beginning with *Zhen* and rising to *Qian*, it reaches fullness; passing through *Xun*, it wanes, and with *Kun*, it is exhausted. The middle line of *Qian* resides within *Kun*, where metal and water share the same origin. The middle line of *Kun* resides within *Qian*, where wood and fire share the same position.\n\n*Qian* gives birth to three daughters, dwelling in the east: above *Xun*, middle *Li*, below *Dui*—two yang producing one yin. *Kun* gives birth to three sons, dwelling in the west: above *Zhen*, middle *Kan*, below *Gen*—two yin producing one yang. The *Kan* embryo resides at *Wu*; the *Li* embryo resides at *Zi*. The west borrows the origin of metal; the east borrows the ancestor of wood. *Qian* retreats to dwell in *Kan*; *Kun* retreats to dwell in *Li*.\n\nIn the method of *Na Jia*: *Qian* corresponds to the full moon, *Kun* to the new moon, while *Kan* and *Li* ascend and descend at the center. Thus, *Qian* embraces *Jia* and *Ren*; *Kun* embraces *Yi* and *Gui*; *Li* embraces *Ji*; *Kan* embraces *Wu*; *Xun* embraces *Xin*; *Zhen* embraces *Geng*; *Dui* embraces *Ding*; and *Gen* embraces *Bing*—all in perfect accord.\n\nWhen *Kun* first transforms into *Zhen*, it is the birth of light, the moon emerging at *Geng*. When it transforms again into *Dui*, it is the first quarter, the moon emerging at *Ding*. When *Qian* first transforms into *Xun*, it is the birth of the waning phase, the moon appearing at *Xin*. When it diminishes further into *Gen*, it is the last quarter, its day reaching darkness. At the new moon, *Zhen* receives the tally, and the *Fu* hexagram begins its cycle. *Zhen* receives *Geng* from the west, its image like the *Zhen* trigram embracing *Geng*. On the eighth day, the *Dui* trigram embraces *Ding*. On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is pure yang, and the *Qian* trigram embraces *Jia*. On the sixteenth, the *Xun* trigram embraces *Xin*. On the twenty-third, the *Gen* trigram embraces *Bing*. On the thirtieth, the *Kun* trigram embraces *Yi*. Thus, *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*, while *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end—this aligns with the firing times of internal alchemy.\n\nZhu Xi, however, treated the *Primordial Heaven* eight trigrams as a single sequence, disregarding the order of lunar phases, yet still aligning them with *Na Jia*. He considered the positioning of Heaven and Earth, the mutual resonance of *Pi* and *Tai*, as correct. Thus, he suggested that Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* might trace its lineage to Chen Tuan’s teachings. Indeed, the arrangement of trigrams in both texts silently accords. Yang begins with *Fu* and culminates in *Qian*; yin begins with *Gou* and culminates in *Kun*. Within a year’s twelve months, a month’s thirty days, or a day’s twelve hours, each completes a cycle of the heavens. The sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred eighty-four lines form the numbers of one celestial revolution, with each line governing a single day—all in precise accord with the *Yijing*.\n\nThe world assumes the *Cantong Qi* imitates the *Yijing*, yet who knows that the wonders of yin and yang, without seeking alignment, naturally align? Some claim the *Primordial Heaven* and *Taiji* diagrams emerged simultaneously, yet Zhou Dunyi and Shao Yong never communicated—thus, the two diagrams do not interconnect. Yet whether vast as the beginning and end of Heaven and Earth, or minute as the life and death of beings, or distant as the changes of ages past and present, all lie within the principles of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness. Is this Shao Yong’s unique insight? From the nebulous and swirling origins of transformation and cyclical return—what Zhu Xi called the \"root source beyond\"—the earlier Confucians had lost its transmission, while those outside the orthodox lineage secretly passed it down as the art of the elixir. Only with Chen Tuan and Shao Yong did it return to the *Yijing*, and its teachings became clear and undeniably true. How could their reverence for this diagram be a small contribution?\n\nYet this trust is not misplaced. If Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan* modeled itself on the *Yijing*, dividing into regions, states, and households, all derived from the number three; Guan Ziming’s *Dong Ji* arranged twenty-seven images; and Sima Guang’s *Qian Xu* employed the number five with fifty-five lines—each sought to emulate the *Yijing* in their own way.",

      "translated_text": "All these works merely patch together and complete books, yet none grasp the fullness of the Dao. Those who skillfully probe the traces of yin and yang and the mechanisms of creation and transformation—when they observe Heaven and Earth from the perspective of the Supreme Ultimate, then Heaven and Earth, too, are but things. Thus we know that Heaven and Earth arise from the *Yijing*, and the *Yijing* does not originate from Heaven and Earth. If one can fully realize the subtleties of the Supreme Ultimate and the functions of the Prior Heaven, then one may encompass Heaven and Earth, mold and complete the myriad things, and hold creation within oneself. In that case, even the Prior Heaven’s One Qi would cease to exist—how much less could mere words convey it?\n\nThe *River Diagram* originally stems from the *Yijing*, which states: \"The River brings forth the Diagram, the Luo brings forth the Writing; the sages took them as their model.\" The *Xici* likewise says: \"Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. The heavenly numbers are five, the earthly numbers are five; the five positions interact and each has its pairing. The heavenly numbers total twenty-five, the earthly numbers thirty—altogether, the numbers of Heaven and Earth are fifty-five.\" This is how Confucius, using the numbers of the *River Diagram*, explained the workings of transformation and the movements of ghosts and spirits. Specifically, it refers to the numbers by which Heaven One generates Water and Earth Six completes it; Earth Two generates Fire and Heaven Seven completes it; Heaven Three generates Wood and Earth Eight completes it; Earth Four generates Metal and Heaven Nine completes it; Heaven Five generates Earth and Earth Ten completes it.\n\nThe *Gu Ming* states: \"The *River Diagram* is kept in the eastern chamber.\" The *River Diagram* and the Eight Trigrams: when Fuxi ruled the world, a dragon-horse emerged from the River, and he took its markings as his model to draw the Eight Trigrams. The *Record of Rites* says: \"The River brought forth the Horse Diagram; the dragon-horse bore the Diagram and emerged.\" The *Analects* says: \"The River does not bring forth the Diagram.\" Confucius explained: \"The *River Diagram* is the Eight Trigrams.\" Thus it is clear that Fuxi took the Diagram as his model to draw the *Yijing*. How could this be dismissed as false?\n\nThis Diagram emerged before the formation of written records, embodying the natural principles of Heaven and Earth. It encompasses the boundless subtleties of creation and transformation and is the source of the images and numbers of all things and affairs. Zheng Kangcheng said: \"The River flows to connect with Qian, issuing the Heavenly Embrace; the Luo flows to connect with Kun, spouting the Earthly Talisman. The *River Diagram* has nine sections, the *Luo Writing* six.\" Liu Xin said: \"When Fuxi succeeded Heaven to rule, he received the *River Diagram* and took it as his model to draw the Eight Trigrams.\" The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces serve as outer and inner. Wang Su said: \"The *River Diagram* is the Eight Trigrams.\" Wang Chong also said: \"The *River Diagram* emerged from the River’s waters—it is the trigrams of the *Yijing*.\" Guan Ziming said: \"In the *River Diagram*, seven is in front, six behind, eight to the left, nine to the right.\" Liu Mu said: \"The *River Diagram* totals forty-five, arranging the Four Images without mentioning the Five Phases.\" The *Da Dai Li Ji* says: \"Two, nine, four; seven, five, three; six, one, eight.\" Tradition holds: \"Nine treasures, modeled on the markings of a tortoise.\" It also says: \"These are writings from before the Qin.\" Ouyang Xiu said: \"The Diagram is the markings of the Eight Trigrams. A divine horse bore it from the River to present to Fuxi. The Eight Trigrams were not made by man but were bestowed by Heaven.\" Thus, the Eight Trigrams were created by man, while the *River Diagram* was not involved. As for the *River Diagram*, it is indeed said to have been born from a divine horse bearing the Eight Trigrams, emerging from the waters—these are the natural markings of Heaven and Earth. Why must it be attributed to Fuxi’s creation?\n\nWang Anshi said: \"The Diagram reveals the Dao of Heaven; the Writing reveals the Dao of Man.\" That which connects with Heaven is expressed through images; that which centers on Earth is expressed through methods. Cai Shen said: \"From Kong Anguo, Liu Xiang and his son, to Ban Gu, all held that the *River Diagram* was bestowed upon Fuxi and the *Luo Writing* upon Yu. Guan Ziming and Shao Kangjie both regarded ten as the *River Diagram* and nine as the *Luo Writing*. Only Liu Mu’s opinion differed, taking nine as the *River Diagram* and ten as the *Luo Writing*, claiming it originated with Chen Tuan—contradicting the views of other scholars.\" He also said: \"Fuxi merely relied on the *River Diagram* to create the *Yijing*; he did not need to foresee the *Luo Writing* to have it harmonize with it. Yu merely relied on the *Luo Writing* to create the *Hong Fan*; he did not need to trace back to the *River Diagram* to have it correspond with it.\"\n\nThe numbers of the *River Diagram* are even; evenness is quiescent, and quiescence employs movement as its function. Thus, the movements of the *River Diagram* all pair with odd numbers: one pairs with six, two with seven, three with eight, four with nine, five with ten. The *River Diagram* is round in form but square in function; the sages used it to draw the trigrams. Master Cheng said: \"The sages saw the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* and drew the Eight Trigrams. The ancient sages merely selected the most evident of divine things. Even if they had not seen the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, they still would have created the Eight Trigrams.\" Within the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, the central number is five. Extending it to exhaust its numbers, reaching ten, then combines to fifty. The *River Diagram* accumulates to fifty-five; its fifty are all derived from five, yet five alone is the source of the fifty and has no source itself. Thus, if five is left empty, it becomes merely fifty. Furthermore, in fifty-five, five is the center, and the ten are divided into the numbers of old and young yin and yang. The fifty, having no function, are then multiplied—five by ten and ten by five—both yielding fifty.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"The round is the stars; the numbers of calendrical reckoning find their omen here. The square is the earth; the methods of dividing lands and arranging wells imitate this.\" The round represents the numbers of the *River Diagram*; the square, the markings of the *Luo Writing*. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen used them together to create the *Yijing*, while Yu and Ji arranged them to compose the *Hong Fan*. Master Zhu said: \"The *River Diagram* aligns with the *Yijing*’s 'Heaven One to Earth Ten' and contains the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth—all are the source from which the *Yijing* emerges.\"",
      "overlap_context": "return to the *Yijing*, and its teachings became clear and undeniably true. How could their reverence for this diagram be a small contribution?\n\nYet this trust is not misplaced. If Yang Xiong’s *Tai Xuan* modeled itself on the *Yijing*, dividing into regions, states, and households, all derived from the number three; Guan Ziming’s *Dong Ji* arranged twenty-seven images; and Sima Guang’s *Qian Xu* employed the number five with fifty-five lines—each sought to emulate the *Yijing* in their own way.",

      "translated_text": "Between Heaven and Earth, the qi of yin and yang, though each has its form, originally bore no numbers. Only with the advent of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* did the fifty-five numbers emerge—odd and even, generation and completion—suddenly manifest and visible.\n\nIn the positions of the *River Diagram*, One and Six share a lineage and dwell in the north; Two and Seven form a fellowship and reside in the south; Three and Eight follow the same path and occupy the east; Four and Nine are companions and stand in the west; Five and Ten keep watch together in the center. This is nothing more than one yin and one yang, one odd and one even, doubling the Five Phases. The *River Diagram* takes the five generative numbers as its foundation, governing the five completion numbers, and places them together in their respective directions—revealing its entirety to humanity and demonstrating the constant essence of its numbers. The *River Diagram* prioritizes the generative numbers, while the ten numbers derive their value from the five, attaching themselves to the generative numbers. The sum of five odd numbers is twenty-five; the sum of five even numbers is thirty. Together, these two make fifty-five.\n\nThe *River Diagram* embodies wholeness, thus culminating in ten, with the positions of odd and even balanced. The void of Five and Ten in the *River Diagram* is the Supreme Ultimate; the twenty odd numbers and twenty even numbers are the Two Modes. That One, Two, Three, Four correspond to Six, Seven, Eight, Nine represents the Four Images.\n\nWu Cheng said: \"The *River Diagram* appeared before Fuxi drew the trigrams, when a dragon-horse emerged from the River, its back bearing these numbers. Its numbers: behind, One and Six; ahead, Two and Seven; left, Three and Eight; right, Four and Nine; center, Five and Ten—five odd and five even numbers paired together. Fuxi observed Heaven and Earth, humans and all things, finding nothing that was not the pairing of yang (odd) and yin (even). Seeing the numbers of the *River Diagram*, he was struck with insight. Thus, he drew one unbroken line to represent yang and one broken line to represent yin. Adding and doubling these, he formed the eight trigrams, then doubled and added again to create the sixty-four hexagrams. This is what is meant by Fuxi drawing the eight trigrams based on the *River Diagram*.\"\n\nThe numbers of the *River Diagram* also occupy five positions, aligning with the circular arrangement of the five celestial palaces of the stars: One and Six in the north, Two and Seven in the south, Three and Eight in the east, Four and Nine in the west, Five and Ten in the center. The *River Diagram* has five positions, each with one odd and one even number—though the numbers total ten, the positions are only five.\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the *River Diagram* was stored alongside the celestial sphere and precious jades in the royal treasury.\n\nChen Tuan said: \"The two diagrams, Five as the constant and the other as the variant—if speaking of the *River Diagram*, then it is the constant and the *Luo Writing* the variant; if speaking of the *Luo Writing*, then it is the constant and the *River Diagram* the variant. Though the two diagrams differ in vertical and horizontal arrangement, they mutually present and reveal one another—this is what is meant by their interweaving as warp and weft.\"\n\nWeng Yong said: \"In the *River Diagram*, the positions of yin and yang take the generative numbers as primary, with the completion numbers paired to them. In the yang direction of the northeast, the odd numbers govern, paired with even; in the yin direction of the southwest, the even numbers govern, paired with odd.\"\n\nHu Yuan said: \"The *River Diagram* divides yin and yang by generation and completion. The five generative numbers of yang govern the five completion numbers of yin, placed together in their directions. Yang within and yin without, generation and completion unite—this is the meaning of harmonious interaction. The *River Diagram*’s number seventeen establishes its form through opposition, thus it is constant.\"\n\nHu Yigui said: \"In the *Luo Writing*, compared to the *River Diagram*, there is only Five but no Ten. Yet the combinations of One and Nine, Two and Eight, Three and Seven, Four and Six encircle and face one another—there is never an absence of Ten. The earlier Confucians deeply investigated the principles of yin-yang creation, exploring the subtle and obscure, and already plumbed the wonders of the *River Diagram*. Yet distinctions between similarity and difference cannot be avoided.\"\n\nLiu Mu said: \"...One and Six in the north, Two and Seven in the south, Three and Eight on the left, Four and Nine on the right, Five and Ten in the center—this is the *Luo Writing*. Wearing Nine and treading One, Three on the left and Seven on the right, Two and Four as shoulders, Six and Eight as feet—this is the *River Diagram*. Thus, Nine is the *River Diagram*, and Ten is the *Luo Writing*.\"\n\nZhang Wenrao, well-versed in Shao Yong’s teachings, also took Nine as the *Diagram* and Ten as the *Writing*. Yet Shao Yong only spoke of round and square, not of the numbers Nine and Ten. He also took Ten as the *River Diagram* and Nine as the *Luo Writing*, aligning with the words of Confucius and Jizi.\n\nSome say that Shao Yong transmitted his teachings through Mu Xiu, and Liu Mu through Zhong Fang—both received them from Chen Tuan. Zhu Xi said: \"Chen Tuan transmitted the *Xiantian Diagram* to Zhong Fang, who passed it to Mu Xiu, who gave it to Li Zhicai, who taught Shao Yong. Zhong Fang also transmitted the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* to Li Gai, who gave them to Xu Jian, who passed them to Fan Kuachang, who taught Liu Mu. Mu Xiu transmitted the *Taiji Diagram* to Zhou Dunyi, who taught the Cheng brothers. The Chengs, following Liu’s teachings and Zhu Xi’s critiques, vehemently refuted them—this is an unchanging judgment for all ages.\"\n\nWei Shi again refuted Zhu Xi, claiming he initially attributed the Nine-*Diagram* and Ten-*Writing* theory to Liu Changmin, falsely ascribing it to Chen Tuan. Jing Shi Jiang Shan later took the *Xiantian* as the *River Diagram*, the Five Phases’ generative and completion numbers as the *Luo Writing*, and the \"Wearing Nine\" arrangement as the Supreme Unity’s descending numbers.\n\nLuo Duanliang once said: \"I received the *River Diagram* from Cai Jitong, who obtained it from a recluse in Shu. Its form resembled a chariot wheel, black and white intermingled, divided into eight parts to form the eight trigrams. The white represented pure yang, symbolizing *Qian*; the black, pure yin, symbolizing *Kun*. The remaining trigrams were formed by gradually diminishing the black and white.\"\n\nXie Fang said: \"I once received the *River Diagram* from an extraordinary person. Its form resembled the eight trigrams, with *Kan* and *Li* inscribed in the center and intersecting, akin to the alchemical arts of *Kan* and *Li*.\"\n\nZhang Heng’s *Qian Zaodu* presents the Nine Palaces’ numbers as the Supreme Unity Diagram, which Liu Mu took to be the *River Diagram*.\"",

      "translated_text": "Some identify the nine- and twelve-number diagrams as the *River Diagram*. Yet how could such diversity and complexity arise? Master Zhu argued that the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* were not to be trusted, a view held since Ouyang Xiu. However, the *Gu Ming*, *Appended Judgments*, and *Analects* all attest to them. Though the numbers transmitted by various scholars for these two diagrams may intersect, they never contradict; whether counting forward or tracing backward, whether arranged vertically, horizontally, or in curves, all follow clear principles—such is the profundity of their explanations.\n\nOuyang Xiu, having never seen the original diagrams, merely relied on commentarial interpretations, dismissing the diagrams as nonexistent and even doubting that the *Appended Judgments* were composed by Confucius. How could he have erred so gravely in his reasoning? The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* encompass the mechanisms of the myriad things’ transformations—what could possibly contravene them? Moreover, the sages indeed used the *River Diagram* to draw the trigrams; can one then equate the *River Diagram* with the eight trigrams? Yet it harmonizes with the *Luo Writing*. The *Luo Writing* and the initial \"one\" to subsequent \"nine\" of the *Great Plan* together comprise the nine categories’ numbers. While rooted in the *Great Plan*, the *Luo Writing* uses the five odd numbers to govern the four even numbers, making odd numbers primary. The one does not pair with four, six, or eight; instead, each adheres to its kind, attaching to the sides of one, three, seven, and nine. The *Luo Writing*’s vertical and horizontal sums total fifteen, while seven, eight, and nine alternately wax and wane. Excluding five and dividing ten, one contains nine, two contains eight, three contains seven, and four contains six—interwoven and interlocked, all align tacitly. Such is the marvel of boundless transformation.\n\nThus, the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* both derive from five, extending to ten, and together form fifty. The *Luo Writing*’s accumulated numbers total forty-five, dispersed externally, dividing yin and yang into old and young. Only five resides at the center, inherently containing the five numbers, thus also totaling fifty. The *Luo Writing* governs change, culminating in nine, with its positions and actualities favoring odd numbers while even numbers are deficient. Yin and yang’s numbers each total twenty. Though their quantities differ, five at the center allows: great yang, gaining five, becomes six; young yin, gaining five, becomes seven; young yang, gaining five, becomes eight; great yin, gaining five, becomes nine. This mirrors the *River Diagram*’s interwoven yin and yang, producing identical generative and completive numbers. The *Luo Writing*’s odd and even numbers oppose each other, just as the *River Diagram*’s dispersed numbers remain ununified; the *River Diagram*’s generative and completive numbers pair, just as the *Luo Writing*’s numbers unite and belong. Hence, earlier scholars regarded the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* as warp and weft, the eight trigrams and nine categories as outer and inner—this is the principle.\n\nThe *Great Expansion*’s number fifty likewise arises from the extension of five, each reaching its ten, combining into fifty—no different in essence. Moreover, both the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* have void centers, embodying the Supreme Ultimate; their odd and even numbers each total twenty, embodying the Two Modes. Their vertical and horizontal sums of fifteen, alternating between seven, eight, nine, and six, embody the Four Images. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* form the four cardinal directions, while *Zhen*, *Dui*, *Xun*, and *Gen* form the four corners—these are the eight trigrams. In the *Primordial Heaven Diagram*’s circular arrangement, *Qian* culminates at noon, *Kun* at midnight, *Li* at dawn, and *Kan* at dusk. Yang arises at midnight, reaching its zenith at noon; mid-yin arises at noon, culminating at midnight. Yang resides in the south, yin in the north. In its square arrangement, *Qian* begins in the northwest, *Kun* ends in the southeast; yang lies in the north, yin in the south—yet it remains no different from the *River Diagram*’s interwoven odd and even numbers. This is the *Primordial Heaven* as the origin of the alchemical Dao.\n\nThe *River Diagram*’s yang generative numbers are five, the root of the five phases; its yin completive numbers are ten, the foundation of the myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six each sum to ten—Metal and Water share the same origin; two and eight, three and seven each sum to ten—Wood and Fire share the same body. Together they total fifty-five, divided among the five directions. One and six reside in the north; two and seven in the south; four and nine in the west; three and eight in the east; five and ten at the center. Subtracting the generative numbers, each direction retains its original number—this is the source of the five phases. Further subtracting the completive numbers from each direction’s original number yields the five phases’ essence. Excluding these, each direction retains five numbers, totaling twenty-five—the root of the five phases, symbolizing the earth of *wu*. Repeatedly subtracting the five phases’ essence, the north retains four numbers, symbolizing Metal. Metal inherently generates Water, yet Metal itself arises from Water, like lead emerging from silver—this is the Metal Tiger. Metal born in Water is the Tiger’s generation from Water. The south retains three numbers, symbolizing Wood. Wood inherently generates Fire, yet Wood itself arises from Fire, like mercury congealing upon encountering lead—this is the Wood Dragon. Wood born in Fire is the Dragon’s emergence from Fire. The east retains two numbers, symbolizing Fire. Fire arises from Wood; extracting mercury from cinnabar is Wood Mercury concealed within *Li*, the mother hidden in the child’s womb—this is the seventh return. The west retains one number, symbolizing Water. Water arises from Metal; the qi returns to its origin, like Metal Lead concealed within *Kan*, the child returning to the mother’s womb—this is the ninth return. The void center symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate; the Four Images unite to form ten—this is the wondrous principle of true yin and earth. All are the mechanisms of heaven and earth’s inverted yin-yang generation, harboring unfathomable marvels. How could the calendrical calculations of the Supreme Unity or the astral numbers of directional arrays compare to these?",

      "translated_text": "Yet some claim these transmissions originated with *Xiyi*, asserting that the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were originally rendered in circles—thus, after the Three Dynasties, the diagrams and writings lay concealed for over a thousand years, preserved only by the *fangji* practitioners, until their resurgence in the Song. However, the *fangji* merely appropriated their numerical configurations, employing odd and even counts to balance growth and decline, aligning them with the dynamics of punishment and virtue, life and death—nothing more than the foundational techniques of calendrical prognostication and astral divination. That earlier scholars dismissed the *Cantong Qi* as unworthy of esteem may have been an overstatement.\n\nAlas, tradition holds: \"The Yellow River brought forth the *Hetu*, and the sage took it as his model.\" He imitated it to draft the Eight Trigrams—yet the Eight Trigrams are not the *Hetu* itself. Moreover, the *Hetu* emerged in the age of Fuxi, though none among the sages of that era spoke of it. Confucius, too, alluded to it but never explicitly described the diagram. After Confucius, from Guan and Liu onward, interpretations proliferated, each clinging to their own views, yet none reached a definitive conclusion. Nevertheless, Master Zhu’s distinction—ten as the *Hetu*, nine as the *Luoshu*—suffices to resolve the matter. Some identify the *Xiantian* diagram as the *Hetu*; others liken it to a chariot wheel’s black-and-white interplay; still others model it after the Eight Trigrams or claim both the nine- and twelve-point diagrams as the *Hetu*. Such disparate views leave later generations at a loss as to which to follow.\n\nYet the original text of the *Xici* states: \"From Heavenly One to Earthly Ten,\" wherein five serves as the generative mother and ten as the generative child. From one to ten, five occupies its natural, fixed position. The fifteen points resemble celestial constellations—hence the name \"diagram\"—what connection does this bear to fantastical absurdities? What room remains for doubt?\n\nAh, Master Cheng remarked: \"Principle precedes image; image precedes number. Grasp the meaning, and image and number reside within.\" From the moment the *Hetu* and *Luoshu* were first inscribed, their significance unfolded through their patterns—reversals and returns, rises and falls, encompassing the hidden and manifest of heaven and earth, the flight of birds and the stillness of plants, the subtlest details without exception. Thus, the *Yijing*’s alignment with the principles of nature and destiny, its embodiment of the Dao of transformation, all rely on images to illuminate principle.\n\nThose who drown in image and number, reducing it to mere divination, fail to seek principle through meaning and stray far from the Dao—such are the scholars of Guo Pu and Guan Lu. Their claim to \"exhaust numbers to determine the world’s images\" and \"manifest images to fix the world’s fortunes\" derives from the movement of spirit and the stirrings of the heart-mind—merely one facet of the whole. If one seeks the *Yijing*’s text through this alone, how can it fully encompass the unity of substance and function, the seamless interplay of manifest and subtle, the doctrines of life and death, the mysteries of the hidden and revealed, and the vast coherence of heaven and earth? To trace the sages’ lineage through such means is something I cannot accept.\n\nThe Dao of nature and destiny is one; scholars need only seek the Dao. If one pursues it at the source of nature and destiny, what remains unseen? Yet if the pursuit lacks diligence, few will perceive it. Han Yu, in his *Inquiry into Nature*, sought to extend the thread of the sages. Though his principles were not fully illuminated, he aimed to broaden them. Through the ages, many have discoursed on nature, but how few have grasped its essence!\n\nYao and Shun embodied it in their nature; Tang and Wu embodied it in their persons—this is the inherent truth of nature. Thus, Yao’s charge to Shun—\"The mind of the Dao is most subtle\"—sufficed to reveal the root of kingly governance. When the Zhou declined, Confucius arose to continue the tradition. His words—\"Nature and the Dao of Heaven,\" \"What completes it is nature,\" \"Each rectifies its nature and destiny,\" \"Know nature, and you know Heaven\"—most keenly express the source of the Dao.\n\nZisi called it \"what Heaven commands is called nature\"; what Heaven bestows upon humanity is nature. To follow this nature is called the Dao. Mencius’ assertion of the goodness of nature aligns with this. The human heart-mind governs nature and emotion, inherently without flaw—this is the nature endowed by Heaven’s mandate. Its possession of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom requires no artifice; this is the goodness that follows. For Heaven’s mandate to things is the goodness of nature, inherently present. Evil arises from the nature of *qi* and material form—this is the nature proximate to one’s constitution. Thus, when moved by external things, stirred by desire, or obscured by habit, distinctions emerge between the wise and the foolish.\n\nYet goodness, like a mirror’s tarnish or water’s turbidity, is but a fleeting cloud over the vast sky. When the tarnish is cleansed, clarity remains; when turbidity settles, purity endures. The inherent goodness cannot be altered. Thus, it is neither augmented in sages nor diminished in fools. Only by fully realizing one’s nature can one remain unmoved by external things, undisturbed by desire, and unobscured by habit. Then, in its utmost emptiness and numinosity, utmost purity and clarity, it shines like the unclouded sky—how could good and evil be conflated?\n\nThus, stillness brings focus, and movement brings uprightness; sincerity establishes and clarity permeates, giving rise to perspicacity. This is the governor of the five senses, the commander of the hundred limbs, the repository of the four beginnings, and the regulator of the seven emotions. In its vastness, nothing lies beyond—here reside the rectitude of nature and destiny, the principles of life and death, the mysteries of the hidden and revealed. In its minuteness, nothing lies within—here are bound the forms of the great and small, the emotions of all beings, the qualities of shape and color.\n\nWhen fully realized, it becomes a Zhou or a Confucius; when perverted, a Jie or a Zhou. In action, it becomes an Yi or a Fu; in purity, a Boyi or a Shuqi; in tranquility, a Yan or a Min—all stand as exemplars of illuminating goodness. Their influence spans generations, enduring without end. In harmony, it becomes ritual and music; in accord, it becomes laws and institutions; in guidance, it becomes the cardinal principles; in regulation, it becomes canonical norms.",

      "translated_text": "All that accords with Heaven’s order and sequence—is this not the public function of Heavenly principle?\n\nMoreover, Yangzi’s claim that good and evil are mixed refers only to the biases of emotions, habits, and qi-quality, not to Heaven’s true mandate. Gaozi’s assertion that \"life is what is meant by nature\" makes all that emotions desire and enact part of nature. Xunzi’s claim that \"nature is evil\" treats goodness as artificial. These views, which fixate on emotions, habits, and qi-quality as the essence of true nature, diverge widely from it. Hanzi’s division into three grades posits that nature comprises three grades of the five emotions, while the seven emotions constitute what nature commands—how vast and multifarious are Heaven’s endowments! Yet how can one establish a foundation from such confusion? All that issues from nature is emotion. How can it be confined to three grades, or further burdened with five natures? These are merely the biases of qi-quality.\n\nLater scholars, noting that such discussions had become rare since the Qin and Han, revived them with particular emphasis. Ouyangzi claimed that \"unity of nature is not an urgent concern for scholars, nor a topic the sages seldom addressed\"—how could the great root remain so obscure? Dongzi said: \"Mandate is Heaven’s decree; nature is life’s substance; emotion is human desire; the Dao is the path to governance; benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music are its instruments.\" Wangzi said: \"Nature is the Supreme Ultimate of the Five Constants, yet the Five Constants cannot be called nature—this comes close to the Dao.\" Yet some depart from Mengzi’s teachings and align with Xun and Han, how misguided! They simply fail to distinguish clearly.\n\nOnly Master Zhou said: \"Nature at rest is what is called sageliness.\" Master Cheng said: \"What Heaven bestows is mandate; what things receive is nature; nature is principle.\" This is truly luminous. Only Zhou and Cheng can be considered Mengzi’s true successors. Their surpassing of the other masters is evident.\n\nYet what of the divergences in the teachings of Laozi and the Buddhists? Laozi said: \"Nature is spirit, the primordial, indestructible numen.\" The Buddha said: \"Nature is awareness, the fullness of original emptiness and numinosity.\" Only by severing worldly affairs and eliminating desires can one avoid defilement, achieve purity, and establish firmness—thus accumulating numinous clarity into manifest spiritual transformation. Yet this treats all things in heaven and earth with form and qi as illusory and empty. Is this not to lose the reality of principle and qi in emptiness and nothingness? As for their exclusive focus on life and death or personal cultivation, how do they differ from the paths of Shen Buhai, Han Fei, or Yang Zhu?\n\nYet the Way of Heaven and humanity is one. The Dao in its utmost purity and essence, principle in its utmost subtlety and profundity—if humans cannot walk alongside heaven and earth without transgression, it is only because they fail to distinguish between Heavenly principle and human desire. Thus they cannot fully realize the hearts of sages and worthies. One who fully realizes the heart fully realizes nature and attains the Dao of mandate.\n\n**On Spirits**\nSomeone asked: \"Daoist lineages take spirits as their concern—do they truly exist?\"\nI replied: \"Who says they do not? The confusion arises only from imprecise distinctions. Heaven is accumulated qi; earth is the denser aspect of qi—these are the formless. Within the movement of yin and yang lies the flowing operation of Heaven’s mandate. Since this flow is ceaseless, there must be something that governs it.\" Master Cheng said: \"That which governs is called the Emperor; its wondrous function is called spirits.\" He also said: \"Spirits are the traces of creation, the inherent capacity of the two qi.\" The workings of yin and yang are invisible, yet their principles can be inferred. Where principle manifests or withdraws beyond perception, the numinous resides. Thus even the sages never denied their existence—they simply did not dwell on them exclusively.\n\nConfucius said: \"Sacrifice to the spirits above and below as if they were present\"; \"The Way of spirits is to be revered and kept at a distance\"; \"The virtue of spirits is most perfect.\" He did not deny their existence—he merely refrained from speaking of anomalies, force, disorder, or spirits, lest people become mired in absurdity. The *Book of Changes* says: \"The unfathomable workings of yin and yang are called the numinous,\" and \"Spirits unite with good and ill fortune\"—this is the meaning.\n\nWhen the heart is preserved, the Dao becomes clear and principle manifest. The mechanism of yin and yang, its issuing and entering, coming and going, is none other than our own heart. Its good and ill fortune are one with spirits—without spirits, they cannot endure. What then can be said of good and ill fortune? Only those who manifest the Dao and embody numinous virtue can unite with it to penetrate the power of spiritual clarity. Thus \"transforming through greatness is called sageliness; sageliness beyond comprehension is called the numinous\"—this is what is meant by \"subtly pervading all things as the numinous.\" The Dao of exhausting the numinous and knowing transformation is fully realized here.\n\nThe sage embodies the wondrous function of heaven and earth, uniting the ultimate achievement of heaven and humanity. Only then does one become numinous without knowing how—this is the numinous. Thus it is said: \"Serving Heaven is illumination; serving Earth is discernment.\" Only by sincerely aligning the heart to move Heaven can Heaven respond through its mechanism. That which is invisible and unknowable is called the numinous presence. Though \"the workings of Heaven above are soundless and scentless,\" resonance here elicits response there—never interrupted.\n\nThus even the wicked, if they fast, bathe, and purify themselves, can serve the Supreme Emperor and spirits. Offerings are accepted through sincerity—knowing sincerity is sufficient to serve Heaven. In sacrificial rites, the burning of reeds and fat reports to the luminous; millet, rice, liver, and lungs, combined with aromatic herbs, report to the corporeal. All arise from the resonance of qi.\n\nAs for the numinous in the manifest world: thunder and drums, wind and rain, frost and dew—its obscurity and brightness, transformations and fleeting myriad forms—if not the work of the supremely numinous, what else could achieve this?",

      "translated_text": "The hidden as ghosts cannot be traced or sought. Yet when the mournful cries of fish and the desolate rustling of reeds gather—whether in sound or form, whether through resonance of qi or the arrival of thought—what is lofty has no shape, what is lowly has substance: these are the stagnant and untransformed, the bent and unextended. This is what is meant by \"essence-qi becomes things, wandering souls become transformations,\" constrained by the contraction and expansion of yin and yang. Thus the yang-essence and yin-corporeality reveal the true nature of ghosts and spirits.\n\nObserve the traces of creation, and the origins of being and non-being become clear.\n\nSomeone asks: The principle of existence is certain, yet when people in the world suffer illness, they say it is the harm of some ghost or spirit, and only by offering blood sacrifices and prayers can they be spared. If the prayers are answered, they clamor to declare the spirit’s efficacy. If unanswered, and a sudden change in life or death occurs, they resentfully claim some ghost has invaded, and the spirit has aided it. Yet when they seek the object of their prayers, it is often not a spirit that Heaven, Earth, or the altars of state should properly worship—these are all excessive cults, unworthy even of the name \"spirit,\" let alone capable of aiding ghosts to violate the Mandate of Heaven. Is this not the height of folly?\n\nThis has not arisen overnight. It is the custom of streets and alleys, where common men and foolish women are deluded by vulgar talk, startling the world and shocking the public, until it becomes a prevailing wind. If one but understands that the living are the numinous presence of qi, the dead are the contraction of qi; the extended become spirits, the contracted become ghosts; the ethereal soul belongs to Heaven, the bodily form to Earth—how could perverse and deviant beliefs still deceive?\n\nThose who preserve the purity and sincerity of their hearts, uniting their power with Heaven and Earth, may achieve feats like Lu Yang, who reversed his spear to halt the sun, or the chaste widow whose weeping brought down frost, or Master Han, who parted the clouds of Mount Heng and drove away the ravenous crocodiles. As the early Confucians said: \"Where there is sincerity, there is spirit; without sincerity, where does spirit reside?\"\n\nThose who daily invoke ghosts and spirits merely awaken the numinous clarity and undivided essence within themselves, aligning with the numinous transformations of Heaven and Earth. This is what Master Dong meant by \"releasing the yang and restraining the yin.\" The *Shenyi* says: \"The qi of prior Heaven is the true imperial law; the spirit of my heart is the thunder official and mountain count.\" This is likely what it means.\n\nThose who dismiss this as esoteric doctrine without examining it—do they truly understand the workings of numinous transformation or the changes of ghosts and spirits?\n\nWhen Mangmiaozi of Zhixing wandered through mountains and marshes, he saw trees: the tall ones twisted and gnarled, the low ones lush and thriving; the crooked ones coiled, the straight ones towering and dense. Some were several feet in girth, others no thicker than a finger. Flourishing and verdant, they filled the cliffs and ravines, valleys and gorges, while clouds and mist rose and fell with them, and birds nested in their branches, singing in harmony.\n\nTurning with a smile, he said: \"I have always loved the lush vitality of things, and none embody it more than plants. Those that soar on wings, glide with scales, or run on legs—are they not all endowed with their own nature? Yet the principle of plants is most visible and delightful. Consider the succession of the four seasons: every flower and blade of grass, whether red or purple, white or yellow, does not miss its time or lose its color. Cold and heat respond to the seasons, and buds and shoots emerge in due course. Their dazzling hues and competing beauty cannot be captured by brocade or cosmetics. Spring cannot make them bloom in winter, nor summer make them flourish in autumn. The swift cannot be hastened, nor the slow forced to delay. Even when planted in halls or cultivated in pots, their branches bent to fit their containers, their natures harmonized to suit their care—though it may seem they cannot follow their Heaven-given nature, and their essence is harmed by constraint and narrowness, yet they do not know their own injury. In the end, they die, but if they await their time and follow the seasons, they will bloom and flourish again. Who, then, makes this so? It is the work of the Master of Creation.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the subtlest and most wondrous is thus revealed, for each thing is endowed with its own nature, each possessing its own singularity—what is meant by \"each thing containing one Supreme Ultimate.\" Yet their nurture depends on the timely arrival of conditions. Thus, if their essence is not depleted nor their growth suppressed, there is nothing strange in this principle.\n\nConsider the mountains and marshes: beyond the reach of manure and soil, beyond the touch of irrigation. Whether moistened by rain and dew, assailed by frost and snow, or subjected to untimely dryness or dampness, uneven cold or heat—without distinction of fragrance or foulness, all rely solely on the nourishment of wind and rain, the steadfastness of earth and stone. Yet the tall and the low, the crooked and the straight, the great and the small—each follows its inherent nature, flourishing and thriving without limit. Those that fully realize the completeness of their endowed nature, though mere mountain blossoms or wild herbs, vie in fragrance and beauty, yielding nothing to those in pots and urns, and far surpassing any single flower or blade of grass.\n\nThus, pines, cedars, and camphor suffice for beams and pillars; catalpa, camphor, and nanmu suffice for corners and edges. Their resin can become oil or lacquer; their withered parts, vessels or firewood. Their sweet fruits are edible; their fine roots, medicinal. Their auspicious blackness can be recorded. Each adapts to its material, yet none are born in deep mountains or hollow forests merely because they are deemed useless—thus preserving their original nature. Each fulfills its singular nature, and those that fully receive Heaven remain beyond constraint. How vast and wondrous is this!\n\nThe Dao in the world is like water flowing through the earth, reaching everywhere without exception. How can plants and trees, devoid of sentiment or knowledge, achieve such harmony? Now I comprehend the principle that the myriad things share one root—a truth constant through ancient and modern times, filling the cosmos and unchanging. I know not the extremity of my joy.\n\nOne who laughed afterward asked: \"Why do you delight in this observation?\"\nI replied: \"It is not for you to know. In observing the nature of plants, I exhaust my own nature—how could I not rejoice?\"\n\nThe one who laughed said: \"What you observe are merely the places where you wander and rest, the sights your eyes have beheld. How can you know the lush verdure of trees, their cycles of prosperity and decline, their waxing and waning with the seasons? These do not occur in a single day. Were they not secluded in the perilous wilds of mountains, they would daily contend with bandits, suffer the calamity of axes, with no regard for age or weakness, crookedness or straightness, hardness or brittleness, size or smallness. Buffeted by wind and frost, felled by ice and snow, they are hewn day and night—carved into boats, bent into mats, chiseled into dwellings, severed for carts, broken for firewood—countless fates. All are harmed by their clarity, destroyed by their substance. Thus, the nature of trees is ruined—what vitality remains to observe? Only what Zhuangzi called the 'gnarled and deformed' mountain trees, which by chance preserve their natural lifespan, may survive. As for those long and great, like lattice and pillars, I have never seen them. You do not choose to depart but instead gaze upon them daily, as Mencius said of Ox Mountain’s trees, once beautiful. Yet how, when felled day after day, can their nature not be harmed, just as one’s own nature is severed without awareness? This applies not only to trees.\"\n\nMaster Shao said: \"Even in wood, stone, tiles, and pebbles, each has its fixed principle.\" What sorrow remains? For the nature endowed in things cannot be harmed. Their suitability for use is a matter of fortune or misfortune—this is their destined lot. Thus, the finest timber, fit for zithers and flutes, is offered in the ancestral temple; the sturdiest, fit for trays and mats, graces halls and chambers. The inferior is placed in lowly quarters; the rotten, cast into dust. Each follows its fate—yet who can destroy or sever that which fully realizes its Heaven-given nature? This is what it means to exhaust one’s nature.\n\nThe one who laughed said: \"Indeed.\"\n\n*Reading the \"Observing Things\" Chapter*\nWhen the books of Confucius and Mencius appeared, their Dao was illuminated. As their Dao faded, royal governance declined. It was not that the books were lost, but that those who spoke of the Dao failed to clarify it. From the Warring States onward, even in the prosperous ages of Han and Tang, those who knew and practiced it were few. With the rise of the Song, the Dao became manifest. Master Zhou elucidated the uncharted depths of the Supreme Ultimate, while Master Shao revealed the infinite principles of the Primordial Heaven. Through them, the teachings of Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius—long severed—were revived. No revival was greater than this.\n\nThe Dao of the sages originates in the heart—*The Book of Changes* is the study of the heart. Master Shao said: \"The heart is the Supreme Ultimate. To study is to cultivate the heart.\" The study of Primordial Heaven is the study of the heart. His words on the heart reached their zenith; his discourse on principle was luminous. His circular and square diagrams exhaust the wonders of *The Book of Changes*. Though vast as Heaven and Earth, subtle as yin and yang, mysterious as ghosts and spirits, profound as images and numbers, the transformations of being and non-being, the boundlessness of things, the divinity of principle—all emerge from the Supreme Ultimate and return to it, gathered within the single heart. Expanding, it fills the cosmos; contracting, it dwindles to the finest hair. Its purity, refinement, depth, and subtlety are truly detailed and precise.\n\nThis is what he meant by \"observing with the heart\" and \"observing with principle.\" He also said: \"Do not observe things with the heart, nor with the self, nor with things themselves.\" Consider the successions of Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang—differing in virtue, merit, exile, and execution; the durations of Zhou, Qin, Han, and Chu—varying in length. The choice lies solely in good and evil.",

Even when planted in halls or cultivated in pots, their branches bent to fit their containers, their natures harmonized to suit their care—though it may seem they cannot follow their Heaven-given nature, and their essence is harmed by constraint and narrowness, yet they do not know their own injury. In the end, they die, but if they await their time and follow the seasons, they will bloom and flourish again. Who, then, makes this so? It is the work of the Master of Creation.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus we know that order and chaos arise from what is esteemed as righteousness or profit, while deviance and rectitude follow from words and deeds. All the affairs of the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons—like a mirror’s reflection in water—reveal even the finest detail without concealment. In turning inward to observe, this is what is meant by the sage’s ability to unify the feelings of the myriad things. This is the Way of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching destiny.\n\nExpanding to its utmost, the numbers of heaven and earth, yin and yang, arise naturally from the formless One, and the non-acting One serves as the model for the Dao. There are three applications of this, corresponding to heaven, earth, and humanity. Thus it is said: before the Ultimate of Non-being, yin contains yang; after the appearance of images, yang divides yin. The cycles of the Celestial Root and the Lunar Grotto reside within the inquiry into the Ultimate of Non-being. How could this not align with Master Zhou’s teachings?\n\nSince the *Yijing* appeared, later commentators have numbered in the thousands, yet how many have truly grasped the sage’s intent prior to the first hexagram line? Yet those who admire such teachings merely seek the leisurely pleasures of seclusion, remaining ignorant of the Way itself. When Han Yu read Xunzi, he took what was closest to Confucius and deemed Yang Xiong a disciple of the sages. Comparing *Tai Xuan* to the *Yijing*, Shao Yong called pre-cosmic learning the study of the heart, and post-cosmic learning the study of traces—movement between being and non-being, life and death, is the Dao. To seek it through cunning calculations and shortcuts is to bend heavenly principle to serve human desire. How vastly distant is such a view!\n\nThis is sufficient to show that his vision was most expansive, his knowledge most far-reaching, his discourse most lofty, his joy most great. He could engage in matters of utmost breadth, depth, height, and magnitude while remaining empty within. Could this not be the work of one most divine and sagely? Truly, it is no falsehood.\n\nWho among those who nurture the heart well could speak of the learning of the heart with him? Alas! Some say that beyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss. Yet Shao Yong may be called one who exhausts the divine and knows transformation. Could this be what the sage did not discuss?\n\nReading the *Biography of Dong Zhongshu*, I observe that after the Three Dynasties, the Zhou declined and the Kingly Way ceased. Qin inherited the practices of the Warring States, its qi dissipated and its ambitions perverse. It burned the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* to ashes, and the transmission of the Dao was nearly extinguished without a trace. When Han arose and the world was greatly ordered, its corrupt scholars and petty officials still clung to old habits, unable to revive the teachings of the former kings from their remnants. Emperor Wen was called a worthy ruler, yet even he failed to employ Jia Yi. A thousand years later, reading Jia’s words still evokes sorrow and indignation—how much more so for those unlike Jia Yi!\n\nDong Zhongshu, lowering his curtain to lecture and recite, did not glance at his garden for three years. In his comings and goings, he moved only in accord with ritual. Scholars all revered him as a teacher. When Emperor Wu sought worthy and learned men, Zhongshu responded with his memorial. At that time, the meeting of ruler and minister was something Qin could never have hoped for. His words were sufficient to expose the flaws of the Zhou decline and restore the correctness of the Kingly Way, with benevolence, righteousness, music, and ritual as its foundation. His distinctions between nature and destiny, feelings and substance, and his discourses on yin and yang, punishment and virtue were incisive.\n\nFrom this we see that in the interaction between heaven and humanity, when ritual and propriety are cultivated in the person, good and evil move heaven. The unceasing transmission from Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang was due to upholding the single Way without the flaws of exhausted governance. How could the mediocre men of Qin and Han ever attain this? Though Emperor Wu was resolute and decisive, after three memorials he still could not implement Zhongshu’s teachings in the slightest, instead sending him to serve as Chancellor of Jiangdu. Was this not a cause for lament in that era?\n\nTake Gongsun Hong, who curried favor to gain power, obtaining a marquisate through classical studies, yet he envied upright discourse and banished Zhongshu to Jiaoxi. Though Zhongshu could not promote his Way, he rectified himself to lead his subordinates, serving two arrogant kings while maintaining their respect. He ultimately retired to complete his studies and writings at home—was this not the perfect embodiment of the Way of advancement and withdrawal?\n\nHis words declared: \"Rectify your judgment without scheming for profit; clarify the Way without calculating its effects.\" Only with the emergence of the Cheng brothers in the Song was this teaching fully elucidated, becoming a model for later generations. At that time, even Ban Gu, Jia Yi, Liu Xiang, and Yang Xiong could not compare—how much less those who came after!\n\nSima Qian wrote that Liu Xiang praised Zhongshu’s talent, saying even Yi Yin and Lü Shang could not surpass him, while Guan Zhong and Yan Ying barely matched him. This was excessive. Liu Xiang’s words were mistaken. Had Zhongshu met a ruler who practiced his Way, would he not have achieved the accomplishments of Yi Yin and Lü Shang? How could Guan and Yan even compare? For Guan and Yan were merely aides to hegemons, capable only of hegemonic affairs—how could they match the greatness of the Kingly Way?\n\nMoreover, considering the depth of his teacher-student lineage, he still fell short of Ziyou and Zixia. Yet when Master Zhou Dunyi revived the lost learning and promoted the Way in the Song, scholars to this day all follow him—the Dao has never perished. How could his lineage be considered flawed? Had Sima Qian seen this, would later generations not have failed to understand Zhongshu? Yet some who recognized his worth sought to enshrine him in the temple and offer sacrifices alongside Confucius, to perpetuate the illumination of Confucius’ teachings and the suppression of the Hundred Schools. But this was never carried out—was this not regrettable?\n\nYet the Dao and words of Zhongshu do not depend on sacrificial offerings. How difficult it is to meet with true understanding! Across a hundred generations, the same holds. Even Emperor Wu of Han, with all his wisdom, cast him aside and did not employ him—how much less those beneath him? There is no cause for surprise.\n\n*Postscript to the Orthodox Lineage of Literary Works*\nThe qi of the Three Luminaries and Five Peaks issues forth as literature, and literature is the vessel for conveying the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "When literature flourishes, the Dao is thereby illuminated—yet it must be rooted in qi. The primordial qi courses through Heaven and Earth, and thus the Dao is established. The ancients of virtue invariably left behind words, for their harmony and compliance accumulated within, and their brilliance manifested without. Without the Dao being full and virtue being luminous, how could this be expressed in words? Thus, the *Orthodox Lineage of Literary Works* compiled by the True and Loyal Duke was precisely to preserve those of correct source and flow—hence the name *Orthodox Lineage*. Its arrangement comprises four categories: first, diplomatic correspondence; second, discourses and treatises; third, narrative accounts; and fourth, poetry and rhapsodies. Only the writings of the Yu and Xia dynasties, the Warring States, the Western Han, and the early Tang—rooted in the *Zuozhuan*—were included. Thereafter, those deemed worthy of emulation—Ban [Gu], Sima [Qian], Han [Yu], and Liu [Zongyuan]—were followed by Ouyang [Xiu], Su [Shi], Zeng [Gong], and Wang [Anshi], while the rest were excluded. Its standards and distinctions were stringent, for it took morality as its foundation, principle and righteousness as its essence, and required that what was expressed in literary form must first attain the correctness of human nature and feelings before it could be deemed fitting. Viewed thus, even among the words of the ancients, those truly in accord are exceedingly rare. How much less could those who fail to grasp this, yet recklessly call their work \"literature,\" hope to align with the masters? Such a goal is unattainable. Yet this is only because their Dao remains unmanifest and their qi unfulfilled.\n\nLearning serves to exhaust principle and achieve practical use, and it must be rooted in the Dao and cultivated through qi. When one knows what to cultivate, qi becomes full and the Dao is established—how could one’s writing then fail to be masterful? I have devoted myself to literature for over twenty years, seeking its essentials. Below the Six Classics, I have savored the works of the Han and Tang masters, aspiring to trace the words of the Three Dynasties and explore how they correspond to the Classics as their inner and outer expressions. Yet I am ashamed that my learning remains weak and sluggish, lacking breadth, depth, and integration—this is my constant fear. Only upon studying this compilation have I gained clarity and insight, deepening my conviction and expanding my understanding. Even if one’s path is not yet correct or one’s cultivation not yet perfected, and thus unworthy of inclusion, this too becomes distinctly discernible.\n\nAlas, how few in the world comprehend this! They prize mere ornamentation, embellishment, triviality, and decadence, regarding this work as distant as a thousand *li* or as perilous as a ten-thousand-*ren* cliff. Who among them realizes that without first following the proper path, one cannot reach the destination? Even those who seek the threads of its source and flow amid the essence and refinement—if they pursue it without guidance—how could they fail to grasp the residual intent of the Loyal Duke? And for those who have the honor of continuing his legacy, how could they not count themselves fortunate?\n\n---\n\n**On Distinguishing the *Xunzi***\n\nThe *Xunzi*, in thirty-three chapters, begins with *Encouraging Learning* and *Cultivating the Self*, grounding itself in the words of Confucius. *The Efficacy of the Ru*, *The Way of the Ruler*, *The Way of the Minister*, *Kingship and Hegemony*, and *Rites and Music* follow, seemingly grasping the beginnings of the kingly way—yet interspersed with debates on enriching the state and strengthening the military. It explicitly declares the inherent evil of human nature as untreatable, all derived from its fundamental premise. By falsely invoking Yao and Shun and rejecting Zisi and Mencius, it paved the way for Li Si’s destruction of Qin and the pernicious habits of the Warring States—how could these be escaped? Li Si studied under Xunzi, and Li Si’s downfall reveals the nature of Xunzi’s teachings.\n\nAt that time, Mencius engaged with Xunzi in debate, yet we never hear from Wan Zhang or his disciples what Mencius’ words on this matter truly were. Had Mencius spoken of the goodness of human nature and first addressed King Hui of Liang with the words, \"There is nothing but benevolence and righteousness,\" then even if his teachings were insufficient for his own era or for ten thousand generations, how far would Xunzi’s words have been from the harm wrought by Yang Zhu and Mo Di? Han Yu claimed that Xunzi \"promoted the Dao in an era when it was no longer transmitted,\" yet he spoke of it only in passing without elaboration. Was this truly because he had no time to refute the resentment of Xunzi’s doctrine of inherent evil, or was there something he did not fully understand? Perhaps he did not necessarily regard Xunzi’s words as inferior to Mencius’—or did he simply lack sufficient conviction?\n\nMoreover, during the reign of King Xiang of Qi, Xunzi was revered as a venerable Confucian master—was there truly no one capable of debating the distinction between kingship and hegemony with him, yet all deferred to him as their teacher? Was this not because they were swayed by his rhetoric, such as his discourse on Duke Ai’s question to Yao, using it to dazzle and entice? Or was it because they were drawn to his techniques of divination, shamans, and belief in omens? Thus, later generations knew only the elegance of his words but rarely scrutinized them.\n\n---\n\n**On the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence***\n\nHistorians speak of the \"Yellow and Lao\" as sharing the same Dao, yet the words of the Yellow Emperor himself are nowhere to be seen. As for the *Liezi*’s attribution of books to the Yellow Emperor, they largely align with Laozi’s teachings. Among transmitted texts, only the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* is claimed as a work of the Yellow Emperor. Its language is plain yet refined, profound yet essential—could such a text have been produced by anyone other than one who embodied the Dao?\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, Li Quan obtained it from Mount Song, stating that it had been hidden by Kou Qianzhi during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei. Li Quan said: \"A hundred words expound the Dao, a hundred words expound the law, and a hundred words expound the technique. The Dao pertains to immortals embracing the One; the law pertains to enriching the state and pacifying the people; and the technique pertains to strengthening the military and achieving victory.\" Yet in its phrasing and meaning, all three are invariably present.\n\nShao Yong considered it a Warring States text, while the Cheng brothers believed it could not have been written later than the end of the Shang or the end of the Zhou—certainly predating the Qin. For in the era of the former kings, when the sagely Dao was luminous, none dared to propagate heterodox teachings. But as the Zhou declined and the Dao became obscured, men of talent and intelligence rarely knew where to turn, so each relied on their own insights to speculate and establish their doctrines. Some orthodox teachings may have been impure or inconsistent, yet this text alone employs paradoxical language that aligns with orthodoxy—it must have been deliberately chosen.\n\nIts great essence takes \"ultimate non-being\" as its宗, and the patterns of Heaven and Earth as its reckoning. It declares that all phenomena in the world arise from non-being, and that if one can return from being to non-being, all is well.",

      "translated_text": "And Master Zhu [Xi] once remarked that this book might well have been written by Guan Yin—yet since Guan Yin was not profoundly versed in the Dao, it is certain that he could not have attained such depth. Cheng [Yi] and Shao [Yong] held it to be a text from the Shang or Zhou dynasties, and if it predates the Qin, then even the Tang masters could not have matched it. Is this not because Confucians avoid speaking of immortals and thus insist it was not written by the Yellow Emperor? Yet Master Zhu’s commentary, though it notes the text’s obscurity and convoluted phrasing, risks leading readers to see only its complexity and miss its unity.\n\nMoreover, to observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the workings of Heaven—one who can do so becomes one body with Heaven and Earth, and the Dao resides within. This is the root of the entire scripture. The principle of human nature and the human mind is one, yet their manifestations in the realm of mechanism are two. Establishing the Dao of Heaven to stabilize its mechanism, one finds that excess movement gives rise to transformation and reversal, and thus Heaven and humanity act in unison. Only by establishing the Dao to stabilize it can the foundations of the myriad transformations be secured, and movement and stillness naturally find their constancy. Even the path of cultivation and refinement may be understood thereby.\n\nAs for the Five Thieves, the Nine Orifices, the Three Essentials, generation and destruction, and mutual restraint—all arise from those who steal the mechanism, and once such theft is rectified, the Three Powers [Heaven, Earth, and Humanity] are at peace. The noble person remains steadfast in adversity and dares not act recklessly, while the petty person treats life lightly and invites calamity. For what cannot be seen or known—is this not the very essence of the ineffable and numinous? Thus sagely achievement arises from this, and divine illumination emerges therefrom.\n\nTherefore, the threefold return through day and night restores one’s original state. Severing profit to guard the source, one transcends the distinction between day and night, life and death. With ears that hear well though blind and eyes that see well though deaf, the mind becomes single-minded, and its strategic power increases tenfold. Thus Heaven’s great benevolence arises from non-benevolence, and perfect impartiality resides in the utmost partiality. Life and death, benefit and harm—the Dao is no different in any case, for all are the natural principles of the cosmos.\n\nOnly those who attain the utmost joy and stillness can unite with the Dao of the threefold return, thereby moving and resting to rediscover it. What they perceive are the patterns of Heaven and Earth. Others see them as sages, yet my own grasp of the patterns of phenomena and seasons has never differed from that of Heaven and Earth—this is why it is called wisdom. Thus the foolish seek to deceive the sage with cunning, while I alone do not deceive the sage with foolishness, nor do I seek to make the sage appear extraordinary.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of spontaneity is still, and from it Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, so when yin and yang prevail, they push one another, and transformation proceeds in order. Moreover, Heaven and Earth generate the myriad things through perfect stillness, and their Dao grows gradually, so hardness and softness prevail, yin and yang push one another, and transformation is inexhaustible. Within this perfect stillness lies the Dao of spontaneity. The ceaseless generation of the myriad things—this is the marvelous vessel of Heaven and Earth. Even the calculations of musical temperament, calendrics, and hexagrams cannot fathom it, for it is the numinous mechanism hidden like a ghost.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams and the sexagenary cycle, as in Shao Yong’s theory of \"inserting the heavenly stems,\" are all techniques of yin and yang prevailing over one another—these can be used to construct hexagram images. Their beginning and end, their patterns, are never disconnected. Yet the versions of the text transmitted by Master Chu [Yunü] and Master Cai [Yong] conclude with \"the patterns of phenomena and seasons, wisdom,\" while the twenty-one sentences that follow are what Master Zhu [Xi] deeply valued. Thus the versions of Master Chu and Master Zhang [Zai] are the correct ones. Extending this reasoning, though the division into three chapters may be said to address distinct matters, it is only by illuminating the essence and extending its application—by establishing the essence so that its function may operate—that one can grasp the mechanism of movement and stillness, the discourse on life and death. Those who cannot do so cannot attain this.\n\nIt is certain that this is not the Yellow Emperor’s book, but must have been written by a reclusive gentleman of the Shang or Zhou dynasties. How could one be partial to the Dao, partial to techniques and doctrines? Thus concludes the first volume of *Xianquan Ji*.\n\n[Textual notes: In the phrase *yì pào yān*, the character *pào* is suspected to be a misprint for *yì*. The character *mǎ* appears to be an error and should be corrected to *yān*. In the phrase *dúlì chí xíng ér bù gǎi zhě yě*, *chí* is likely a misprint for *tè*.

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *The Veritable Record of the Primordial Supreme***\n\nThe establishment of the Dao as a teaching begins before Heaven and Earth, and its end remains unknown even after their formation. Its origins trace to the Most High, though the world transmits only that during the Yellow Emperor’s time, it was known as Master Guangcheng. The Emperor once sought the Dao at Mount Kongtong, later casting a tripod to refine the elixir before ascending on high.\n\nYet when examining the records and other texts, they all state that he was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of the Royal Archives in Zhou, later becoming the Archivist of the Treasury. After eighty-odd years—though Sima Qian claims over two hundred—he was known as a reclusive gentleman, posthumously styled *Chi*. Confucius once traveled to Zhou to inquire of him about ritual. When Zhou declined, he departed for Qin, passing through Hangu Pass, where the magistrate Yin Xi, having observed the qi, welcomed him and urged him to write. Thus, he composed the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls to transmit to the world.\n\nAccording to genealogical records, some say he was Li Qian of the Zhou, whose wife, a daughter of the Yishou clan named Yingfu, bore a son named Er, styled Boyang. Others claim the Li clan descended from Gaoyang’s son Tingjian, who served as Grand Judge under Yao and took the surname *Li* from his office. Later, Li Zheng’s wife, Qie of the He clan, fled punishment under Zhou and survived by eating the fruit of the *li* tree, hence changing their name to *Li*. Still others say Li Lingfei attained the Dao, and his wife, Lady Yin, gave birth to Laozi, whose personal name was Hongyuan, styled Yaoling, also called Boyang, Lao Laizi, or Grand Scribe Dan. The accounts vary.\n\nAs for the Yellow Emperor’s predecessors, they existed from the very beginning of the Three Sovereigns’ era, and the transmission of their divine transformations has continued unceasingly across hundreds of millennia. Thus, the compilation of this *Veritable Record* must have its basis.\n\nThe spirit knows no bounds—it may precede or follow, exist or not exist—viewing a thousand years as but a single breath. It cannot be measured by form or sought through traces. Therefore, that which cannot be spoken is called the Dao; by namelessness, one observes the beginning of Heaven and Earth; by desirelessness, one perceives its mystery. Thus, one engages in the affairs of non-action and practices the teaching of no-words, causing the people to be without knowledge or desire through non-contention and non-theft. This was how, as Zhou declined, Laozi sought to restore customs and save the age by returning to simplicity.\n\nHad he, at that time of moral decay, instead instructed the people in the ways of names, desires, action, and words, how could they have known that the crooked is made whole, the bent is made straight, the hollow is filled, and the worn is renewed? Thus, he stabilized the age with the nameless uncarved block, so that none could distinguish Dao from benevolence and righteousness—thereby restoring antiquity.\n\nHis words emerged in the aftermath of Qin’s tyranny, and when Han arose, its governance was aided by purity and stillness, like water quenching fire. Was this not the precedence of Huang-Lao over the Six Classics? Speaking of the trends of the time, Laozi valued the Dao’s emptiness and non-being, adapting to change through non-action. Hence, his writings, subtle and profound, are indeed difficult to fathom.\n\nLater rulers of the world adopted his teachings as their model. What remained of his legacy was enshrined as the *Celestial Canon* and *Cavern Records*, revealed in *Numinous Writings* and *Hidden Instructions*. Cultivated in the self, it enables transcendence and ascent to the heavens; applied to others, it saves the world and benefits all things—thus encompassing the Dao of both inner sageliness and outer kingship.\n\nYet if one clings to the theories of great scholars and masters, reducing it to the likes of Zhuangzi and Liezi, dispersing the *Dao and Virtue* into mere discourse, or worse, conflating it with the Legalist and Nominalist schools of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, this is entirely misguided. Even more extreme is the error of dismissing it as mere emptiness and delusion.\n\nNevertheless, the *Veritable Record*’s meticulous and comprehensive account could not have arisen from private veneration alone, deceiving the world and enduring so long. Now, our August Emperor, endowed with Heaven’s mandate and benevolent sagacity, has first annotated the *Dao and Virtue* in two scrolls, employing it to govern with purity and tranquility. What greater fortune could there be for our Dao?\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the Hongwu reign, the Bureau of Daoist Registrars was established, and our fellow mountain dweller, Master Cao Xiwu, assumed office. His virtuous conduct and sincerity have earned him imperial favor surpassing all previous ages—could this not be due to his support of the transformative power of purity and non-action?\n\nIn his leisure, he examined and corrected this record, commissioning its printing to broaden its transmission, and asked me to compose this preface. Though I am unworthy and tremble at the task, how could I refuse to set forth its beginnings? Yet the Dao of divine transformation and mysterious penetration—what the sage leaves unspoken beyond the Six Directions—is glimpsed herein. With reverence, I write this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *The Gazetteer of Mount Longhu***\n\nThe Dao lies hidden in the most subtle yet manifests in the most evident. Heaven and Earth are vast, their yin and yang revolving in cycles, yet principle is made manifest therein. The myriad things flourish and decline in endless succession, yet pattern is made manifest therein. This subtlest of mechanisms lies concealed within the most evident, unseen by mortals. Only after persisting for a thousand years without extinction does its truth become known.\n\nThat which is called the Dao—empty, formless, profound, and silent—originates in Heaven. Within the boundless and indistinct, its essence and signs reside. Though unseen, it may yet be known.\n\nOur Most High’s teaching, from the time of the Yellow Emperor and the Wen and Jing emperors onward, has consistently employed its principles of purity and non-action, proven effective in the world. Some compare it to the Legalist and Nominalist schools of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, while others dismiss it as the strange and absurd doctrines of fangshi. Thus, there are those who condemn and reject it as heterodoxy.\n\nYet Sima Qian observed that its movements align with the formless, sustaining the myriad things, its guidance simple and easily grasped. The Daoist school has indeed existed since antiquity. Thus, the words of Guan Yin and Zhuangzi and Liezi have further elucidated what was incomplete. Their teachings of softness, humility, and withdrawal were sufficient to remedy Zhou’s decline, guiding the world and shaping customs. How could one regard them as mere profundities?",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, the establishment of spiritual teachings as guidance—how could it deceive later generations to lead them astray? From the Warring States onward, Mao Jun of Qin, our ancestral Celestial Master of Han, Xu and Ge of Wu—all stand as its most illustrious exemplars. The Celestial Master, endowed with a once-in-an-era disposition, received the transmission directly from the Most High. Thus, the esoteric transmissions of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, talismanic methods—once concealed within the nine heavens and ten poles—descended in full to the world. He then journeyed to Wu in Shu, where he refined the elixir upon Dragon-Tiger Mountain. This mountain, renowned throughout the realm, ranks among the blessed lands, and is celebrated alongside the Three Maos and Mount Jian. Since the Marquis of Liu of our Zhang clan, forty-eight generations have passed—surpassing even these two mountains in distinction.\n\nThrough the Wei, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties, each era bestowed honors and ranks in full measure. Whether in the splendor of its mountains and rivers, the magnificence of its temples, the flourishing of its people; the marvels of its immortal traces, the numinous efficacy of its Daoist practices, or the eminence of its titles and prestige—each generation has admired, extolled, and immortalized them in poetry and prose, engraving them in metal and stone. The transmission has endured for over two thousand years, growing ever more prosperous with time, its influence expanding ever further. Was this not due to the boundless virtue of past generations—relieving the suffering of beings, averting disasters, and shielding from calamities—whose hidden blessings sustained the people, subtly aiding royal transformation, and thus ensuring an unbroken lineage of such enduring renown? Or was it also the profound favor of the mountain and river spirits, nurturing and protecting them to achieve this?\n\nThus, the *Mountain Records* cannot be left unrecorded. In the spring of the second year of Huangqing of the Yuan, Master Wu, the hereditary preceptor of the Mysterious Teaching, compiled it into three scrolls and presented it to the court. The imperial decree ordered Minister Yuan, Wenqing, and Minister Cheng, Wenxian, to compose its preface. My great-grandfather, Master Liu, and my grandfather, Master Taixuan, basked in imperial favor, their glory resplendent in their time, honored in the annals of records—a distinction of the highest order. My late father, Master Chongxu, in the early reign of the previous emperor, was repeatedly summoned to the imperial presence, where profound grace was bestowed upon him. As for myself, though unworthy, I early inherited the teachings, received exceptional favor, and oversaw the renovation of the temple halls. Later, upon the enthronement of the present emperor, I was first to receive the imperial summons, enjoying the boundless benevolence and vast blessings of two reigns—gifts beyond full recounting.\n\nUpon reviewing the old records, I found them crude, shallow, and commonplace, and felt a deep sense of regret. Some said: \"In this flourishing age, if we do not delve into antiquity and seek out hidden truths to compile a grand record of the mountain’s glory, would we not allow its rare fragrance and noble footsteps to fade into obscurity, like a pearl buried in the depths, its precious essence neglected and uncherished—would this not be self-abandonment?\" Though my resolve is earnest, my learning falls short. I thus commanded Instructor Li Tangzhen, whose cultivation is pure and sincere, to search for missing materials. My second brother, Yuqing, with keen determination and sharp talent, vigorously assisted in the endeavor. The work was then divided into ten scrolls. As it neared completion, a virtuous gentleman offered to sponsor its printing—how could I not contribute a preface to commemorate this?\n\nThe Dao in the world moves in harmony with heaven and earth without conflict; as it resides in humanity, it is nothing less than flourishing and great. To record this without neglect is to worthily inherit its established legacy and extend its abundance to future generations. It should endure as long as the mountains and rivers—how could it ever end? Yet as eras change and ages pass, records may not capture everything in full. Still, those who admire its lingering influence and distant traces may yet find value in this work.\n\nRespectfully, I presume to place this preface at the beginning.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Genealogy of the Han Celestial Master’s Lineage**\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Manifest the Dao, and the numinous power of virtue is enacted—thus may one partake in divine communion and receive spiritual protection.\" That which fills heaven and earth, enduring through past and present without cease, is the Dao. To make the Dao manifest is to reveal its wondrous functions in full, aligning with virtue—thus may one respond to all changes and assist the divine. This is what is meant by \"assisting heaven and earth in their transformative nurturing.\"\n\nSima Qian said: \"The Daoist school practices non-action, concentrates the spirit, moves in accord with the formless, sustains the myriad things, adapts to the times, responds to transformations, establishes customs, and applies its methods—nothing is unsuitable.\" How true this is! The Most High was born in the Yin dynasty and served as the Keeper of Archives for Zhou, later becoming the Historian Beneath the Pillar. Through unfathomable and divine transformations, he descended upon the world in successive ages as the founder of the Mysterious Teaching. Our ancestor, the Han Celestial Master, inheriting the legacy of the Marquis of Liu, personally received the Dao from the Most High. Thus, the hidden and untransmitted scriptures of the immortal canons and cavern records descended fully into the world. Thereafter, he subdued demons and spirits, refined the divine elixir, achieved transcendence, and transmitted the sword and seal to his descendants—a lineage now spanning fifteen hundred years. Though dynasties have changed and things have transformed, the transmission has never faltered. Is this not because the teachings of purity and non-action, with their numinous efficacy, align with the celestial virtue, and thus suffice to assist in transformation and nurturing?\n\nTo this day, in every renowned mountain and secluded region, immortal traces remain. The far-reaching fragrance of his descendants and the enduring glory of their lineage clearly attest to their hidden support of royal governance and their boundless beneficence toward the people. From the late Han onward, those dwelling on Dragon-Tiger Mountain lived in seclusion among cliffs and valleys, cultivating and refining to prolong their years. By the early Song, their Daoist practices gradually gained renown. During the Daoguan and Chongning eras, the Perfected Lord of Emptiness and Stillness emerged. His divine works and wondrous responses, once manifested in the practice of refining qi and cultivating form, thereafter flourished even more, rivaling the achievements of the past.\n\nAmong his descendants, none shone brighter than my great-grandfather, Master Weishan, and my grandfather, Master Taixuan. Their illustrious deeds in rituals and prayers, their encounters with imperial favor at its zenith—during that time, their marvelous signs and abundant traces were revered even by scholar-officials, surpassing what came before.",
      "overlap_context": " and reject it as heterodoxy.\n\nYet Sima Qian observed that its movements align with the formless, sustaining the myriad things, its guidance simple and easily grasped. The Daoist school has indeed existed since antiquity. Thus, the words of Guan Yin and Zhuangzi and Liezi have further elucidated what was incomplete. Their teachings of softness, humility, and withdrawal were sufficient to remedy Zhou’s decline, guiding the world and shaping customs. How could one regard them as mere profundities?",

      "translated_text": "In our present dynasty, my late father, Master Chongxu, flourished under the sagely court, which had unified the realm and all beneath heaven. His lofty standing and towering prestige shone brilliantly in his time, his honors enduring from beginning to end—how could those of former eras compare? Such must be the legacy of a lineage blessed by divine luminaries.\n\nI, unworthy and of mediocre talent, have inherited this illustrious legacy, yet my undeserved favor from the throne fills me with trembling awe. As the history of our lineage remains obscure to the world, I fear its omissions and gaps. In earlier days, while attending my father, I received from him an old manuscript, which I entrusted to the eminent Daoist Tongxu. I sought a preface from the Grand Historian Song Lian, yet had no leisure to compile and edit it for circulation. The original text, however, was verbose and cumbersome; thus, I have presumptuously revised, abridged, and rearranged it for publication, hoping to fulfill my father’s wishes.\n\nAlas! The principle of all things is that they wax and wane. To bear the past forward and open the way for the future is no easy task. Since the latter ages, many have abandoned substance for superficiality, vying for power and profit. If one cannot attain mastery in learning and radiate the brilliance of virtue to exalt one’s lineage, how can they be said to carry on the work of their forebears? How could they even begin to comprehend it?\n\nWhat was transmitted by the Most High—its exalted virtue and conduct, its monumental achievements—ensures its perpetuation without end. Yet how is this so? It is because the divine and luminous reside in the person. Those who come after must strive with diligence, and if they can expound and continue this tradition, only then will its teachings not fall into oblivion.\n\nThis work is titled *Genealogical Records*, following the example of historical texts.\n\n**Postscript to the Zhang Lineage Genealogy**\n\nIn ancient times, those who received surnames and clan names were all descendants of sages and worthies. Some took their names from states, and though the states perished, the names endured. Over time, lineages faded and clans were lost—this was not uncommon. The system of genealogical records was overseen by a bureau established by historians. When the bureau was abolished, scholar-official families compiled their own genealogies to order generational ranks, distinguish degrees of kinship, and ensure that all descendants preserved the reverence for ancestors and respect for lineage. This is among the greatest duties of the noble-minded.\n\nThe Zhang clan traces its lineage to the Ji surname, descending from Qingyang, son of the Yellow Emperor. His fifth son, Hui, served as Minister of Bows, inventing the bow and arrow. He used nets to hunt birds and beasts, presided over the worship of the Fox Star, and his descendants perpetuated this office, thus being granted the surname Zhang. In the Yin dynasty, Zhang Muzi, and in the time of Emperor Yao, Zhang Guo, both gained fame as immortals. By the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, Zhang Zhong served as a minister, and his descendant Zhang Hou became a grandee of Jin. When the Three Families partitioned Jin, the Zhang clan served as ministers to Han for five generations. Sima Qian recorded that the Zhangs were originally of the Han royal clan. After Han’s fall, Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu, avenged the First Emperor of Qin and changed his surname. The old genealogy begins with the Marquis of Liu as the founding ancestor, with no records preceding him. Having examined its outline, I have sought to supplement its omissions.\n\nThe Marquis of Liu was originally from Fengyi in Pei. He aided Emperor Gaozu in establishing the Han dynasty, was enfeoffed as a marquis, and his lineage prospered for seven generations, many of whose meritorious deeds were recorded in history. By the Tang dynasty, the Zhangs were listed among forty-three eminent clans—including Anding, Fanyang, Taiyuan, Nanyang, Dunhuang, Xiuwu, Shanggu, Peiguo, Liangguo, Rongyang, Pingyuan, and Jingzhao—producing seventeen chancellors and eight marquises. In the tenth generation, the Celestial Master of Han, the True Man of Tongbai, was born. He moved from Pei to Hangzhou, passing through Dantu County in Zhenjiang, where there stood a temple to the Marquis of Liu. In Changzhou, the immortal site known as Zhanggong Cave also bore his name, likely a shrine to his beneficence. Thereafter, the family settled in Zhejiang.\n\nThe Celestial Master of Han was born on Tianmu Mountain in Hangzhou, becoming the founder of the Orthodox Unity tradition. Through his refinement of divine elixirs and exorcism of demonic forces, he journeyed to Shu and eventually settled on Longhushan in Xin[zhou]. His lineage flourished, surpassing all that came before. Historians, unaware of these developments, assumed that the Marquis of Liu’s line had ended when his state was abolished in the second generation. Little did they know of the thriving branches that spread across the north and south.\n\nFrom the tenth generation of the Celestial Master onward, the tombs remained intact, and the generational records preserved. Those residing on Longhushan numbered twenty-eight generations. Including the distant ancestors of the Marquis of Liu, whose origins are unknown, the lineage spans over fifty generations. As for the divergences among branches, the distinctions between prominence and obscurity, and their various fates—these cannot be fully traced.",

      "translated_text": "Some traditions hold that the Zhang clans of Shixiao in Min and Shangrao in Xin[zhou] share common ancestry. When questioned, their descendants and elders could still recount old tales, yet when pressed for generational records, no evidence could be found. As for the inquiries across the regions east and west of the Yangtze—where lineages of lofty rank and esteemed repute have flourished, and where the imperial court’s reverence has never waned—few can rival them. Could this enduring prosperity and longevity arise without the divine efficacy and transformative power of their ancestral line, whose virtue has spread across the four directions?\n\nYet I have often lamented how those in the world who crave fame and praise fabric genealogies to dazzle others. In their eagerness to claim kinship with the noble and illustrious, they resort to forced connections and convoluted proofs. Where, then, lies their true filial piety? Our Zhang lineage, descended from divine luminaries, has endured for over a thousand years. Yet commentators dismiss it merely as a succession of empty titles within an esoteric tradition—unaware that the transmission of jade tablets and sacrificial vessels has continued unbroken across generations. Perhaps the fault lies in the insufficiency of records. Still, that its full glory remains obscured stems from earlier generations’ lack of resolve in seeking the root. Thus, even the most learned scholars of the time left no written account of it—a profound regret.\n\nToday, our lineage’s descendants are but a fraction of what they once were. The ebb and flow of fortune evoke both sorrow and joy, yet how can we neglect the task of compilation? I, however, am of mediocre talent and unworthy of this burden, ever fearful that the thread may snap, leaving future generations ignorant of their origins. How then will they honor their lineage and safeguard its foundation?\n\nSome say that in compiling genealogies, the close should be detailed and the distant abbreviated. Each descendant should elaborate on their immediate kin, so that even the abbreviated entries may be inferred through mutual reference. Later generations must grasp the weight of their ancestors’ virtue and legacy, dedicating themselves to its preservation, ensuring that its influence and grace do not fade. Only then can they truly inherit its goodness.\n\nThe words of Han Xiang, who urged reverence for family records and remembrance of ancestral glory, reflect the essence of learning—how can we not take heed? Thus, the ancient system of genealogies, designed to strengthen the root, was not established in vain. Here, I append these reflections to the end of this compilation, tracing its origins, while leaving the task of full illumination to the great hands of our age.\n\n**Postscript to the Recorded Sayings of the Thirtieth Celestial Master, the Vacuous Tranquility Perfected Lord**\n\nWithin the cosmos, the purest essence of light and mountain-spirit coalesces in humanity alone. When one cultivates the self, what lies within inevitably manifests without. How, then, can one who harbors such inner abundance remain silent? Even the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi—who cast aside the body, subdued the senses, and rejected all external attachments, turning wholly inward—required words to convey and establish their doctrines for posterity. From this, we see that even those who wander beyond the mundane world do not deem words useless.\n\nTheir words, like clouds drifting across the vast sky or ripples on a still pond, form patterns with their movement, yet defy pursuit by mere traces. This differs from the words of Confucians, whose expressions range from bold and unrestrained when successful to melancholic and lamenting when in adversity. Nevertheless, the Dao’s profound spiritual transformations, which endure as long as heaven, are not defined by the presence or absence of words—how then could one judge immortality by them?\n\nThe Thirtieth Ancestor, the Vacuous Tranquility Perfected Lord, possessed innate wisdom and karmic roots, flourishing in an era of harmony. During the Chongning and Jingkang reigns, Emperor Huizong’s devotion to the Dao reached its peak, and true immortals emerged in abundance. Among them were Xu Shenfang, Wang Wenqing, and Lin Lingsu, who stood alongside the Perfected Lord in that age. Whether subduing malevolent spirits, calming turbulent tides, or receiving imperial honors, their deeds bore extraordinary signs.\n\nAs the nation faced hardship, the Perfected Lord foresaw omens of disaster and, with a mere gesture, summoned wind, thunder, and timely rains. His divine power was so manifest that he became a paragon of the celestial court, his blessings extending to all beings. Though centuries have passed, people still speak of him with admiration—not like those who sought fleeting fame, only to vanish without a trace.\n\nThe *Record of Responses and Transformations* meticulously documents his meritorious deeds. His teachings, which guided the world, and his verses, which refined the spirit, continue to awaken the deluded and dispel ignorance. Had he not roamed beyond the primordial chaos of the cosmic egg, shed the dust of the mundane world, and attained a state utterly free of even the slightest impurity, could his attainments have reached such heights?\n\nThose across the land who recite and long to see his works regret their incompleteness. Though they were once published, much has since been lost. I have sought them in sacred mountains and re-engraved them to broaden their transmission. May scholars and seekers alike delve into the meaning beyond his words, awakening to the secrets of the \"fire talisman\" and plumbing the mysteries of lead and mercury.

      "translated_text": "If all things are thus, how much more so the human heart, which even fewer examine? The goodness inherent in human nature—once consciousness takes shape—exists in all, quietly abiding within, no different from the Way of things. Yet private desires and worldly concerns obscure this truth, just as the flourishing and withering of seasons cannot be escaped. Only by perceiving these obscurations and dissolving desires entirely does the original goodness of the serene heart remain. Thus, the path of learning lies in embracing benevolence and righteousness, upholding ritual and discipline, to preserve its center and restore its origin. Then the serene heart within—like the kernel within a fruit—exists in us without question.\n\nFor a scholar to establish himself and honor his kin is not to seek success through such means; otherwise, it cannot be called true learning. In Poyang and the western prefectures of Jiangxi, wealthy merchants expanded their fortunes through trade. During the Five Dynasties, eminent scholars and great families flourished, with the Zhou clan being particularly prominent. By the Yuan dynasty, Nan Weng, Director of the Bureau of Scholarly Worthies, was renowned for his learning. Dwelling among the lakes and fields, where mountains gleamed and waters shimmered, he delighted in the scenery and built the You Ran Pavilion there, perhaps inspired by the poetry of Tao Yuanming of Jin. Soon after, he entered court, where officials and scholars all composed tributes in his honor.\n\nInitially, both Nan Weng and his elder, Left Vice Director Bo Wen, held illustrious positions, their clan prosperous and numerous. Their kinsman, Langzhong, upheld the family legacy without fail. When war erupted at the end of the Yuan, the pavilion was destroyed, but upon Langzhong’s return from official service, he recovered and preserved the relics of past generations as if they were his ancestors’ own handiwork. I, humbled by my deep bond with Langzhong, was shown his collection and entrusted with these words.\n\nThis compilation shines with literary brilliance, reflecting Nan Weng’s prosperous era, though the name *You Ran* was chosen in his days of obscurity. Its various compositions—flavored with the praises of renowned officials and scholars—celebrate his later success. Though his affection for his homeland’s lakes and mountains may differ from Tao Yuanming’s seclusion, the enduring legacy of his family and the serene heart he cultivated, expressed through landscape and inspiration, set him apart. Nevertheless, the vicissitudes of scenery, like the cycles of flourishing and withering, are bound by the principles of qi and reason. Those with deep roots have profound origins, just as the longevity of a family depends on the depth of its accumulated virtue.\n\nDuring the height of the Yuan, scholars from all directions gathered like clouds, yet how many of the Zhou clan’s contemporaries remain today? Langzhong not only continued their legacy but also reassembled this collection to inspire future generations, revealing the serene heart that lies within. My ancestor, Tai Xuan, shared a generational bond with Nan Weng and Bo Wen, and I have been honored with Langzhong’s friendship across three generations—how could I refuse this request? If his descendants cherish this work, the legacy of *You Ran* will transcend the constraints of prosperity and decline, for it springs from the boundless manifestation of perfect virtue.\n\nThus, I offer this preface in respectful response to his request.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Essentials of the Elixir Manual***\n\nWhen the writings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi emerged, our Dao flourished. Historical records tell of the Yellow Emperor seeking the Way from Guangchengzi on Mount Kongtong, whose teachings—though neither mystical nor abstruse—were concise, essential, and readily understood and practiced. Later, King Mu of Zhou constructed the Grass Pavilion to welcome recluses, elevating their esteem. Masters like Guan Yin and Zhuangzi, active during the Warring States, differed in their approaches according to the times, yet their transmission shared a single source.\n\nAt its root lie the Three Caverns, Nine Tiers, and the various scriptures of the Daoist Canon. Its application in the world is the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship. For instance, the governance of the Duke of Zhou and Cao Shen through tranquility exemplifies this. Its essence lies in returning from existence to non-existence, from fullness to emptiness, following the flow of primordial qi, deepening the root and firming the stem, returning to the origin and reverting to the source. Thus, nature and life merge, one guards the singular truth, and transcends into the formless.\n\nBy the time of the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han, they were deluded by alchemical arts, and the teachings became confused. Later, the so-called *Golden Elixir* and *Great Cinnabar* originated with the *Golden Green Dragon-Tiger Scripture* and the *Supreme Stone Wall Song*. During the Han, Wei Boyang, drawing from the *Golden Green Scripture*, composed the *Triplex Unity*, using the *Book of Changes* to elucidate the elixir. He expounded on the five phases, eight trigrams, yin-yang, and the warp and weft of cosmic principles, detailing the mechanisms of fire, medicine, growth, and transformation. Some cited minerals, plants, and herbs to illustrate substance and function; others employed metaphors of infants and transcendent beasts to conceal profound mysteries.\n\nThose who followed, however, drowned in metaphorical language about wood and stone, losing sight of the essential meaning and misleading the world. Not only did the transmissions of inner and outer alchemy become obscured, but those unversed in their exploration dismissed them as bizarre and deceitful, dismissing the true principles of body, mind, nature, and life. Such distortions not only misled their own time but also left lasting harm for future generations.\n\nThe transmission of outer alchemy involves refining the essence of the five metals and eight minerals according to the fire phases and the *Yin Convergence*, no different in principle from the ascent and descent of inner alchemy. Thus, the workings of inner and outer alchemy are one. Before birth, the human form belongs to yin, formed by the congealment of essence and qi. It must draw upon the essence of metals and minerals, the radiance of clouds and sunlight, to refine and transform, achieving the marvel of lightness and flight. Hence, among famous mountains and rivers, remnants of elixir furnaces and medicinal cauldrons remain. The legacies of our ancestors—the Celestial Master of Han, Historian Xu, and Immortal Ge—are particularly renowned. To abandon these two transmissions is to embrace falsehood.\n\nIn the late Yuan, unscrupulous individuals promoted heretical teachings on \"sexual arts,\" compiling spurious texts under the guise of venerable traditions to deceive the world.",

      "translated_text": "Wealthy merchants and powerful magnates often pursue these practices in hopes of prolonging life, yet their indulgence in desire inevitably leads to the ruin of body and fate. How dire must be the karmic retribution for those who first propagated such teachings! I have long wished to eradicate this pernicious influence, yet my reach has not been wide enough.\n\nOthers rely on texts concerning herbs, clouds, mists, massage, or Daoist breathing exercises, treating them as shortcuts to mastery. Though these may nurture longevity, to seek true accomplishment through them is as futile as climbing a tree to catch a fish or carrying firewood to extinguish a blaze—nothing more than the proliferation of heretical doctrines and reckless conduct.\n\nThere are the Northern and Southern Lineages: the Quanzhen School venerates Wang Chongyang of the Golden Perfection, while the Southern Lineage follows Zhang Ziyang. Zhang’s writings are abundant yet veiled, while Wang’s are direct and concise. Zhang’s transmission requires the integration of inner and outer alchemy to achieve fruition, whereas Wang’s focuses solely on inner cultivation. Yet the profound secrets of their teachings must be pursued with diligent inquiry, for they cannot be fully conveyed through texts alone.\n\nI inherited this tradition under the gracious and munificent favor of the August Emperor, who urged me to advance in the study of the Daoist lineage. For over a decade now, I have traveled far and wide, engaging in discussion and seeking counsel from masters of the four directions, never daring to rest. Yet my humble talents and limited understanding have left me unable to fully repay the imperial benevolence or illuminate the radiance of our teachings. This compilation, titled *Essentials of Elixir Refinement*, gathers the scriptures, treatises, poems, and formulas I have studied over the years—from the divine masters and patriarchs of antiquity down to the present—examining their differences and selecting their essentials to serve as a guiding standard for learners. It is not merely for ease of study but aims to elucidate the principles of nature and destiny, the vital essence of spirit and qi, uniting all in one comprehensive whole. Through recitation and contemplation, one may avoid the pitfalls of erroneous teachings and need not heed the derision of those who seek worldly utility or universal benefit. In this way, the transmission of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Liezi may yet remain unbroken. If this work is disseminated widely and enduringly, the blessings of our Dao may reach all. Moreover, for those who retreat to the mountains and forests, accumulating practice day by day without cease, how can the attainment of transcendence and soaring through the heavens remain unattainable? Yet this depends on those of superior capacity and deep karmic roots, who must realize it through their own cultivation.\n\nHerein lies the preface to the *Commentary on the Scripture of the Generation of the Divine Chapters*.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"The divine is that which wondrously brings forth the myriad things.\" It accomplishes transformation and governs the spirits; its divinity is boundless, so profound that even the sage cannot fully comprehend it. The *Changes* speaks of the divine in the most absolute terms. All things arise from the singular qi, which divides to form the Supreme Ultimate, the Two Modes, the Four Images, and the Five Phases, each occupying its place within qi. From the distribution of the Five Phases’ qi, the ceaseless generation of the ten thousand things unfolds. In the movement of the Five Phases, yang culminates in nine, yin in six; the principles of two, five, nine, and one are all contained within the Five Phases. One is the root of all numbers, and qi is the mother of all existence. The flow of qi is governed by the divine, from which all transformations emerge. Heaven is formed by the accumulation of qi, and the Emperor is named for his governance of the divine.\n\nFrom the singular qi arise the three qi, from the three arise the nine qi, and from the nine qi comes boundless generation, filling the six directions—all transformations of qi, which we call the various heavens. These heavens return to emptiness and nothingness, for they cannot be sought through form. Thus, the establishment of our teachings is rooted in emptiness and spontaneity, which are none other than spirit and qi. To know how to nurture spirit and qi is to perfect the Way of nature and destiny. Though the methods of cultivation may vary, their origin in the Three Caverns and Nine Heavens is one.\n\nThe three realms are vast and obscure, their talismans forming scriptures unlike the mundane discourses of the human world. The *Scripture of the Generation of the Divine Chapters in the Nine Heavens* is profound in its meaning, its divisions and phrases revealing the deepest mysteries. Each chapter governs an original destiny and corresponds to a heaven, exhausting the path of refinement. Internally, it cultivates the self; externally, it delivers souls. Its recitation—nine cycles and seven repetitions—follows numerical subtleties that can lead to spontaneous attainment, ascending to the celestial court in broad daylight. Yet this is not merely the result of recitation.\n\nTen completes the cycle of numbers, upon which the creation of heaven and earth depends. The human body embodies the creation of heaven and earth—how could the Way of transcendence and response remain unattainable? The text adheres to the principles of golden elixir and return to the origin, for nine is the number of yang. The wondrous teachings of the Primordial Beginning and the petitions of the Divine Kings are most solemn in their warnings of calamities and karmic seeds. Since the eras of Red Clarity and Kaihuang, the celestial bureaus have conducted their selections, ascending step by step. Those who neither cultivate virtuous conduct nor seek the supreme Way—how could they not feel profound awe and trepidation? Those who do cultivate may not only transcend the kalpas and achieve perfection but also ascend to the ranks of the divine, for this arises from nurturing qi, refining spirit, returning the nine qi to the myriad spirits, and merging the three realms into one qi.\n\nThis is what is meant by knowing the divinity of the divine, without which one cannot grasp the source of its divinity. Regarding the discourse on life and death, refining the self’s spirit can deliver the departed. Though this manifests the boundless compassion of the Most High, it also stems from the immeasurable merit of self-cultivation. Thus, this scripture harmonizes with the *Scripture of Salvation*, the *Great Cavern*, and the *Scripture of Deliverance from Suffering*, their inner and outer meanings fused as one. Those who diligently recite and study it, interpreting its words to fathom its depths, will daily deepen their understanding of the Dao.\n\nDong Guishan of Qingyuan has provided clear and insightful annotations, serving as a bridge between the seen and unseen worlds. In my leisure, I have commissioned its carving and printing to broaden its transmission, a deed of profound kindness and beneficence. When asked to write a preface, how could I presume to expound its principles and guide all toward reverence, whether in this world or beyond? Yet by adhering to its teachings and cultivating without cease, one may eventually attain spiritual transformation, soaring through the void, returning one’s celestial nature to the realm of emptiness and nothingness, and roaming the heights of purity and clarity. This depends on those of superior capacity and deep karmic roots, who must realize it through their own evidence.\n\nThus, this preface is placed at the beginning.",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the Record of Mount Wuyi**\n\nThose who compile geographical records and local gazettes often overlook the renowned mountains and great rivers, their numinous traces and distant wanderings left insufficiently detailed. This is not due to gaps in the historical records, but rather because the learned scholars of later ages, wary of empty exaggerations, have shunned such accounts. Yet the immortals and perfected beings of antiquity—wherever their divine presence dwells—manifest everywhere. Their extraordinary powers to avert disasters and ward off calamities, their unfailing responses to prayers, surely contribute in hidden ways to the imperial order. How could they lack merit in aiding the world? Yet if historians fail to record them or chroniclers neglect their details, then after a thousand years, their traces may fade into oblivion. Should not those who study the teachings devote themselves to preserving such knowledge?\n\nWuyi in Jianning is the Grotto-Heaven of Ascending Perfection and Mystic Transformation. According to the *Records of Hongjian* from the Jin dynasty, a divine being once descended upon the mountain’s summit, claiming the title \"Lord of Wuyi\" after receiving the Emperor’s mandate to govern the earthbound immortals. The mountain thus took its name. Yet the *Biographies of the Immortals* in the *Transmissions of Bai Ziqing* states that a man of Qin named Qian Keng once secluded himself there with his two sons, the elder named Wu and the younger Yi. The truth of these accounts remains unresolved.\n\nThe *Han Treatise on Sacrifices* records that Emperor Wu of Han once worshipped the Lord of Wuyi in Jianning, entrusting the rites to his sacrificial officials. Remnants of the Han-era altar still stand on the mountain. Some say that on the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the second year of the First Emperor of Qin, the Supreme Emperor, along with the Primordial Lady of Mount Taimu and the Perfected Wei Zijian, convened a gathering atop the Peak of the Canopy Pavilion. A rainbow bridge spanned the heavens, and hundreds of figures ascended in single file. They addressed the locals as \"descendants\" and feasted them with wine and fruit, their chambers adorned with brocade, their furnishings resplendent, celestial music resounding. Then, as wind and rain arose, they vanished without a trace.\n\nZijian had first studied the Dao on this mountain, learning alongside Zhang Zhan, Sun Chuo, and eleven others. They encountered an immortal riding a crane and received the teachings, all ascending to immortality. From the Tang and Song through the Yuan dynasties, those who attained transcendence here emerged in every generation.\n\nThe Chongyou Abbey was first established during the Tianbao era of the Tang. By the eighth year of Baoda in the Southern Tang, Li Xuanfu, having attained realization in the Dao, relocated it to its present site and was granted the name \"Assembly of Immortals.\" In the early Song, its halls and corridors were renovated. Emperor Taizong honored it with an imperial edict, and in the second year of Xiangfu, it was endowed with fields.",

      "translated_text": "In the early Xining era, an official of the second rank was appointed to oversee it. During the Shaosheng, Yuanfu, Duanping, Jiaxi, and Shaoding reigns, prayers for rain were invariably answered, prompting repeated bestowals of honorific titles and grants of land and tax exemptions. In the Tianli era of the Yuan, imperial favor was again conferred as before, and those of pure conduct and steadfast virtue never ceased to emerge. Thus, its renown spread throughout the realm, rivaling even the Three Mountains in fame.\n\nThe region is known as \"Cinnabar Mountain and Azure Waters,\" where extraordinary peaks and splendid ridges emerge in succession along the winding river, their cliffs and hues embracing one another in a grand encircling embrace. Caves, grottoes, and sacred altars abound beyond enumeration, each a site of unparalleled beauty, and which among them has not been the dwelling of transcendent beings and extraordinary figures? Thus, luminaries such as Master Zhu Wen, Minister Cai Wenjie, and Academician Liu Wenjian—eminent scholars and great Confucians of their time—also studied and lectured here. That the splendor of the Nine Bends is renowned across the four directions is no mere coincidence.\n\nI have often marveled at the gatherings of the two Directors Yang and Xu on Mount Sanmao within the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, or at the assembly of Ma Gu with Cai Jing and Fangping upon the immortal’s altar. Consulting the records, even Liu Xiang of the Han, famed for his exhaustive mastery of texts, did not speak falsely. From this, we know that the gatherings at Manting were not baseless, and how could they go unrecorded? The mountain’s annals are meticulously researched and detailed, truly worthy of transmission to posterity.\n\nI have long wished to visit but have yet to fulfill this desire. The abbey’s superintendent, so-and-so, recently requested a preface, and though I am unworthy due to my shallowness, I have sought out the accounts of elders and fragmentary texts to supplement what was lacking.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Records of the White Crane Abbey***\n\nSince the Yellow Emperor obtained the tripod and ascended after refining the elixir of immortality, and King Mu of Zhou built the Grass Pavilion to summon immortals, tales of transcendence have flourished. By the Qin and Han dynasties, the fervor for seeking immortality reached its peak, and masters of esoteric arts emerged in succession, often resorting to fantastical claims and exaggerations to deceive and captivate rulers enamored of such pursuits. The transmission of their arcane and abstruse teachings, mingled with falsehoods, naturally drew ridicule from their contemporaries. Yet were there not true immortals who concealed themselves in remote and secluded places, abandoning fame and renown to cultivate the Dao? Their alchemical furnaces, medicinal mortars, sacred scriptures, and profound secrets were either hidden within mountain caves or left in the world in concealment or revelation. Though their traces differed, their legacy has been transmitted from antiquity to the present, generation after generation.\n\nThe White Crane Abbey in Fengcheng, Jiangxi, traces its origins to the era of Emperor Wen of Chen’s *Dajian* reign, where the divine traces of the immortal Gan Jun remain. In his youth, Gan Jun was renowned for his filial piety, his conduct celebrated in his hometown. After years of Daoist study, he heard of the virtuous Xu Jun of Jingyang and sought him as his master. Xu Jun accompanied him to study under the female immortal Chen Mu of Danyang, where Gan Jun received esoteric teachings. His mastery of the Dao grew daily, and he followed Xu Jun in accumulating merit along the rivers and lakes. Whether subduing monstrous pines, slaying flood dragons, or exorcising malevolent spirits, he wielded his three-foot sword to achieve feats that would benefit myriad generations. His name and deeds endure eternally—how could it be otherwise? Moreover, his meritorious deeds are too numerous to record in full.\n\nXu Jun, too, disseminated teachings on clarity, loyalty, and filial piety, all rooted in the principle of the Great Mean and utmost rectitude—unlike the mere talismans, incantations, and pacing the stars practiced by others. Gan Jun, renowned for his filial conduct, ascended to immortality and soared through the heavens. Was not his attainment of the Dao and his merit largely due to his loyalty and filial piety? Thus, the path of immortals to transcend the mundane does not abandon humaneness but rather perfects it. That Gan Jun, having achieved the Dao, served his mother until her passing before departing—this is the epitome of harmonizing both.\n\nMoreover, the abodes of immortals are invariably situated in landscapes of majestic beauty, and the elegance of Fengcheng’s scenery must have nurtured his innate qualities. This spring, on my return from paying respects at the Jade Dragon Abbey on Mount Xishan, I passed through the White Crane Abbey. Though it was a stormy evening, I sought out its relics and remnants, and my admiration was deeply stirred. Though the abbey lies in a secluded corner, its scenery is serene and exquisite. Upon inquiry, I learned that its two main halls once housed the abbot’s quarters of my ancestor, the Perfected Lord Xu Jingyang, and that the Dragon Pool before them was where the Perfected Lord Feihuan once soared. The Daoist assembly leader, Zou, and the elder, Xiong, who oversee the abbey, presented me with Gan Jun’s *Elixir Canon*, the abbey’s records, and a letter from the Perfected Lord to Abbot Ren. Their words were profoundly illuminating, and though the events are extraordinary and the names endure, how could one not feel a deep sense of regret and longing?\n\nLater that summer, someone arrived from the mountain and requested a preface for the abbey’s records. From my youth, I have been enamored of renowned mountains and rivers, seeking to explore their hidden wonders, yet I have always regretted not being able to visit all the famous sites of antiquity and the present. Now, having read the words of the immortal Gan and walked upon his sacred ground, how could I refuse to write this preface? Moreover, this pertains to the lingering echoes and lost traces of my ancestor—how could I not strive to detail their records? That the abbey’s superintendent has diligently fulfilled his duty and compiled these texts, intending to preserve them in print, is truly a commendable pursuit of their origins. If in the future the numinous transformations of true immortals endure alongside these records, will this not be a great boon to our Dao? Those who follow, take heed and strive onward.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Collected Poems of Master Danmo* by Zhang**\n\nThe *Collected Poems of Master Danmo*, comprising several volumes, has been compiled by my friend Dazhuang, who has asked me to write a preface. I cannot refuse.\n\nIn my youth, I often attended Master Zhang in the presence of my late father and benefited greatly from his teachings. At that time, the esteemed local scholars Lu Bogong and Xia Bocheng were his fellow students and friends, and their scholarly pursuits advanced in tandem, making it impossible to discern who was foremost. Master Zhang hailed from a prominent family in our district, which had produced generations of officials and scholars since the Song and Yuan dynasties, many of whom gained renown through their literary achievements.\n\nFrom childhood, Master Zhang displayed exceptional talent and a keen intellect. As he matured, his learning became vast and his memory prodigious, though he excelled particularly in poetry. During the late Yuan dynasty, poets of neighboring prefectures who gained fame—such as Zhang Zhongju, Huang Junrui, and Wei Dapu—all engaged with him as peers.",

      "translated_text": "Master Li Zhonggong and Master Zhu Fanyuan were still his teachers. He traveled to Yan and Zhao with his accumulated learning, yet ultimately found no kindred spirits, and so journeyed through Wu and Chu before returning to settle. Before long, the realm was thrown into turmoil, and heroes arose on all sides. Those who usurped power and seized titles, hearing of his reputation, sought to recruit him, but he withdrew in seclusion and refused to bend. His hardships and loyal indignation were all expressed in his poetry, while his spirit remained as bold and unyielding as ever.\n\nAt the founding of our dynasty, when the realm was first pacified, he was among the first recluses summoned to the capital. He was appointed magistrate of Jiading Prefecture, and upon completing his term, was permitted to retire due to age. He then returned home, journeying along the Yi, Wu, Yue, Huai, and Xiang rivers. In his later years, he built a retreat among the fields and forests, secluding himself to teach at home, and his poetry grew ever more refined. Once, when dozens of the prefecture’s people were falsely implicated in a fabricated disaster, Master Zhang exonerated them and secured their safety—a deed for which the people still hold him in gratitude.\n\nHis poetry, in form and spirit, drew from the *Airs* and *Elegantiae*, while deeply immersing itself in the styles of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties. As for the poets of the High Tang and the early Yuan, he did not deign to mention them. His bearing was lofty and imposing, his appearance striking, and thus his words and thoughts flowed with divine swiftness, as if preordained. He did not rely on exhaustive search or labored thought, yet achieved a grandeur both profound and enduring—like the boundless clouds of the vaulted heavens or the ceaseless waves of the Yangtze—immeasurable and beyond tracing. This is why those of shallow talent and narrow vision could never attain his heights. His renown among princes, scholars, and officials was thus well-earned.\n\nAlas, much of his lifetime’s writings was lost amid the ravages of war, with only fragments remaining. Master Lu once gathered what he could—perhaps one or two hundred pieces—intending to preserve them in print. Before the task was complete, he passed away, and the collection was again scattered, with little surviving. Those who cherished his work could not bear to discard it, and so I have transcribed a tenth of it, most of which aligns with the selections in *Dazhuang’s* compilation.\n\nThough I once studied under Master Zhang and failed to live up to his teachings, how dare I presume to compose this account? Yet his learning was vast, his words eloquent, and his literary brilliance unmatched in his time. His great virtue and towering reputation were already evident in his deeds, and his legacy, though dimmed, shall not fade into oblivion.\n\nMy elder brother *Dazhuang*, diligent in study and devoted to righteousness, will surely carry on Master Lu’s aspirations with ease—how could he not delight in upholding the Way of literature?\n\nThe Master’s personal name was *Shuai*, his courtesy name *Mengxun*, and his sobriquet *Danmo*. His disciples referred to him as *Master Danmo*.\n\n**Zong Lian’s Preface**\n\nMy friend, Master Ni Zizheng, in his youth studied under our late teacher, Master Xia, and later received the teachings of Master Lu’s *benxin* doctrine from Master Peng Mengyue. His conduct was steadfast and sincere, earning the trust of his community—even the humble and unlearned recognized him as a gentleman. Though he lived in poverty in a humble lane, he remained self-disciplined, cautious in his associations, and sparing in speech. He never ceased seeking instruction from teachers and friends, and his demeanor was always marked by humility. Afflicted by chronic illness, he seldom wrote, but when compelled to compose, he grounded his work in the classics, ensuring its purity and correctness.\n\nI once heard the teachings of *xingli* from Master Peng, and in our discussions and refinements, Master Ni was my greatest aid. For over a decade, our bond remained as close as a single day. In a certain year, he was recommended for office and appointed instructor of Xinjian, returning home twice during his tenure. There, we delved into the words and deeds of ancient sages and worthies, finding solace in the quiet of overgrown groves, crumbling pavilions, lamplight, and moonlit ponds. His spirit was rich and sincere, rivaling that of the ancients.\n\nIn the spring of the seventeenth year of *Hongwu*, he traveled to the capital after mourning his parents, but succumbed to a minor illness and passed away. Overcome with grief, I urged his son, Heng, to preserve his father’s writings. Four years later...",

      "translated_text": "Heng presented several writings, titled *Zonglian Ye*, and entreated, saying: \"When my late father served in Xinjian, the county academy was once the study hall of Prime Minister Zonglian of the Yuan. Hence, he named his work thus. None understood my father’s depth of learning as Master Mo did—would you honor us with a preface?\" Unable to refuse, I read the texts twice and sighed in reflection: \"Of scholars who pursue learning, many seek fulfillment through others, while few seek it within themselves. My friend was nurtured by the harmony of heaven and earth, the refinement of mountains and rivers, and the blessings of his ancestors. His nature was pure, his qi clear, his conduct upright and unsullied—qualities beyond the reach of mediocre scholars or vulgar men. Having fulfilled himself inwardly, he had no need of external validation. Thus, his discourse and manner arose from the simplicity of principle and the subtlety of attaining the Dao, self-evident without exhaustive inquiry, self-manifest without deliberate assertion. Was this not the fruit of his innate understanding?\n\nNaturally, in his actions and teachings, he eschewed superficial recitation or rhetorical flourish, grounding all in the rectification of the self and sincerity of purpose. With the self rectified and sincerity established, the Way of the sages and the methods of governing the world were already complete—what need was there for superfluous elaboration? His policy proposals, lectures, and expositions all emerged from the essentials of uprightness and the methods of self-cultivation. Even the Yang and Qian of the Lu school would scarcely surpass him. His poems and verses, rooted in the truth of human nature, embodied the refined elegance of Wei and Meng, the serene simplicity of Tao and Liu.\n\nAlas, he was never granted a grand office to fully express his harmonious and pure cultivation—how rare such men are in this sagely age! Even now, among Xinjian’s students, those who once heard his words stand firm in their resolve. Was this not the fruit of his profound influence in nurturing integrity and discipline? Yet his learning was rooted in the Lu school, and those who venerate Zhu Xi may not embrace him. Thus, his steadfast independence and unwavering clarity remain little known. Nevertheless, when one examines the essence of his thought and the substance of his words, can they truly be dismissed?\n\nIf his teachings endure, they will surely serve as wings to the words of Zhou, Cheng, Zhu, and Lu. My friend Wu Bozong has composed his epitaph, but I lack the eloquence to amplify its praise. Thus, I offer this preface in lieu of refusal, recording the origins of his work.\"\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Yunxi’s Poetry Collection***\n\nMencius said: \"When the traces of the true kings faded, poetry perished; with poetry gone, the *Spring and Autumn Annals* arose.\" How difficult it is to speak of poetry! After the *Three Hundred Poems* and the ancient *fu*, the Han poets Su and Li, and the Wei masters Cao, Wang, Liu, and Ying, still drew near to the *Airs* and *Elegances*, beginning to transform them. By the early Jin, the likes of Ruan, Lu, Pan, and Zuo had not yet let the tradition decline. Later, in the Six Dynasties, Bao, Xie, Yan, and Zhang emerged, but their tones grew delicate and languid, their forms ornate and florid—the purity of the *Airs* and *Elegances* gradually dissipated.\n\nBy the early Tang, Song, Du, Chen, and Liu arose, followed in the High Tang by Wei, Liu, Wang, and Meng, whose spirit and cadence soared with unmatched vigor. Yet the one who synthesized it all was Du of Shaoling. Even contemporaries like Gao, Li, Cen, and Jia could not rival him. In his poetry, whether in adversity or prosperity, Du’s songs aligned with the *Airs* and *Elegances*, offering a model for all. By the late Tang, customs grew extravagant, and in the Song, only Su Shi, Mei Yaochen, Shi Yannian, Wang Anshi, Ouyang Xiu, the Su brothers, Zhu Xi, and Yang Wanli were deemed exemplary. In the Yuan, Fan, Yang, Yu, and Jie revived fading echoes, directly reviving the High Tang. For a time, scholars of the imperial academy and literati from all quarters took them as masters. In the regions between Jiangdong and Jiangxi, those who excelled in poetry flourished.\n\nThose who attained mastery within themselves found the vastness of the cosmos and mountains, the minutiae of flora and fauna—regardless of scale or beauty—stirring their hearts when perceived. Their diction and thought surged like rivers and seas, unstoppable. Thus, the literary men and ink-slingers of the age vied in splendor, arrayed like scales on a fish. Yet how many among them achieved grand and complete works, worthy of ascending to the ancients and serving as models for posterity?\n\nThe *Three Hundred Poems* were selected from the words of commoners and simple women, yet their satire, praise, and lament were fit for the ancestral temple, aiding governance and preserving the royal grace. If poetry perished and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* succeeded it, then poets must strive to revive what was lost. Yet later scholars, if they do not trace the source and follow the stream, if they do not arise from the correctness of a tranquil nature and the substance of self-cultivation, but instead chase after superficial imitation and embellishment, gleaning only the remnants of the ancients, merely dabbling in ink and plagiarizing fragments, racing to outdo one another in ephemeral verses of orchids and moonlight—how can they be deemed worthy of poetry?\n\nMy friend Yang Mengyu’s family is renowned for poetry. In my youth, I read his uncle Xianmin’s poems, though I regret not seeing them all. This spring, Mengyu was invited to tutor my nephew, and I lamented our late acquaintance as I studied his discourse and manner. He also presented several of his poems, which I read in full. Upon inquiring about his family, I learned that his ancestors, beginning with his great-uncle, were esteemed scholars, known as the \"Master of Guanzhong.\" By the Sui and Tang, many held prominent offices. One ancestor, whose name is recorded, served in Jiangxi and later settled in Shuibei Village, Jinxian County, during the first year of Gaozong’s *Linde* reign. In the Song, a certain Zhongbo passed the imperial examinations, served as magistrate of Changsha, and was later promoted to transport commissioner of Jiangxi before his death.",

      "translated_text": "There was also one named Longwei, who likewise passed the imperial examinations and served as registrar of Poyang. His father’s younger brother and younger son both held office in the Yuan dynasty: the former as examiner in the Secretariat, later promoted to vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, and posthumously honored as minister of the same ministry. Thus the clan flourished with each generation, and those now dwelling in Shuibei number twenty-nine in descent.\n\nTheir learning originated with Shuneng, who studied under Wei Jianxiu, a student of the Song dynasty Imperial Academy, and Master Jianxin Weixian. Shuneng’s younger son Xianmin and his own younger son both received instruction from Shuneng, perpetuating the family’s scholarly tradition. Jianxin was refined in temperament and unassuming in demeanor; in his later years, he also admired Daoist teachings on seclusion and reclusion, inviting renowned masters to rigorously educate his sons. Mengyu is virtuous and erudite, his bearing and literary style marked by clarity, elegance, and breadth—modeled after Du Fu yet encompassing all poetic forms. Indeed, as a family of official rank for generations, their noble origins and long-cultivated scholarly refinement run deep.\n\nI am certain that neither worldly success nor obscurity disturbs his inner peace. Had he been placed among the ranks of the eminent, who is to say he could not have continued the sacred music of the ancestral temple, enriching the literary legacy of a flourishing age? Such is his aspiration toward the grand tradition of *Guofeng*, *Ya*, and *Song*. As for myself, unworthy as I am, exiled to remote mountains and dense forests, my mind wanders the desolate shores of wind and moonlight. My own shallowness has surely been refined by his brilliance, yet how could I fully comprehend Mengyu?\n\nYet I am struck by the rarity of those in this world who truly understand poetry—even Mengyu is seldom recognized. How few can soar beyond the ancients and contend with the Creator! When I asked about his uncle, my affection for him left me no choice but to await another day to do justice to his merits. Is this not so?\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Xu Clan Genealogy**\n\nI have read the *Rites of Zhou*, which states that the duty of the *xiaoshi* (minor historian) is to establish lineage, distinguish senior and junior branches, and thereby determine the order of the state. Though ancient times lacked genealogical records, the strict distinction between major and minor clans was maintained. Only after the decline of the clan system did emphasis shift to family status, giving rise to genealogical records. These serve to clarify lineage and distinguish degrees of kinship.\n\nYet those who compile genealogies often seek to glorify their ancestors and elevate their descendants. Whenever they encounter a prominent figure of the same surname, they invariably claim affiliation, fabricating connections to complete their records. Though such self-deception may bring temporary pride, it undermines the principles of honoring ancestors and clarifying lineage. How, then, can later generations trace their roots? This is why scholars and officials reject such practices.\n\nTracing further back, details grow scarce, and inaccuracies may arise. Some disregard a family’s historical standing or the purity of its customs, valuing only wealth and fame. They revere great households and prestigious lineages, yet how can they verify distinctions of antiquity, the origins of surnames, or the bestowal of clan names?\n\nThe Gaoyang Xu clan descends from the Marquis of Xu and the Lord of Qi in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. After the *Spring and Autumn* period, the state ceased to exist, and its descendants took the former fief as their surname. According to the genealogy, seven members of the Xu clan held marquisates in the Han dynasty, losing their titles only after Wang Mang’s downfall. In the Eastern Han, the upright official Xu Pan’s descendants settled in Runan, each branch gaining renown. Xu Jing served as Grand Tutor of Shu, while Xu Chu, in service to Wei, was enfeoffed as a marquis. In the Jin dynasty, Xu Zi was nominated as *xiaolian* but declined office; his descendants flourished in Gaoyang. Xu Shao was enfeoffed as Duke of Anlu in the Tang, and his grandson Jingzong became prime minister of Longxiang. Xu Riyuan died for righteousness during the *Tianbao* rebellion. In the Song *Xiangfu* era, Xu Sui served as director of the Directorate for Palace Buildings. Xu Yi, in the Yuan dynasty, was appointed pacification commissioner of Jianghuai, Jinghu, and the Two Zhe provinces. His descendants grew numerous and held successive court positions. One ancestor, through official promotion, was transferred to Yihuang in Fuzhou, where the family settled, becoming a prominent clan of Jiangyou.\n\nMy connection to the Xu family is one of kinship by marriage. My cousin Biyuan once entrusted me with their genealogy to compose a preface. I have long reflected on the inexorable cycles of prosperity and decline, glory and hardship—how profoundly they unfold without end! In my youth, I heard of the customs of old families, none more illustrious than those of the Yuan dynasty. Due to its long reign, its benevolence and generosity, and the flourishing of commerce, all who bore its legacy sought to revive and restore it. Thus, not only did extravagance and indulgence prevail, but the influence of poetry and books, along with the virtues of filial piety and brotherly love, still occasionally thrived.\n\nYet over thirty years have passed, and with the shift of fortune, all has changed. What once stood proud now lies in ruins. Is this not the inevitable ebb and flow of destiny? For those who uphold their family’s legacy through learning and conduct, without genealogical records to trace their lineage’s reach or the origins of their branches, how can the noble deeds and illustrious achievements of their ancestors avoid fading into obscurity? Few indeed are those who preserve their genealogies. That the Xu clan has so carefully safeguarded theirs, tracing their roots to officials of high rank and esteemed reputation, may be called a return to fundamentals and self-awareness.\n\nAlas, I have yet to meet the standard, but Biyuan’s words compel me. Thus, I offer this preface without hesitation.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to *Zeng Yu Fengzi***\n\nAll beings endowed with form and *qi* arise from non-being and ultimately return to it. Thus, form is borne by *qi*, and *qi* governs form. The primordial *qi* animates heaven and earth, while yin and yang operate within it. Heaven’s canopy, earth’s support, the radiance of the sun and moon, the sequence of the four seasons, the alternation of day and night, the transformations of ghosts and spirits, the multitude of the ten thousand things—all their ceaseless movements arise from the mutual generation and transformation of being and non-being.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in instructing others guided them solely toward the Dao. To understand the Dao is to grasp the mechanism of being and non-being, generation and transformation. Yet today’s so-called scholars pursue empty fame and superficial adornment, neglecting the inner for the outer. How can they silently seek and inwardly comprehend the interplay of being and non-being, generation and transformation?",

      "translated_text": "While dwelling in the mountains of Qi, I wandered leisurely beneath the pines where cranes roosted. There I encountered a Daoist, his hair wild and unkempt, who bowed and spoke: \"I have roamed rivers and seas for many years, once questioning extraordinary persons about the Way of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar. I believe in Liezi’s teachings on the Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed, and that there are those who attain divine transformation through riding the wind. Though I do not yet know if I am capable, is it so—or is it not? I wish to have this clarified.\"\n\nI replied: \"Wind, as a thing, has sound but no form. Master Zhuang called it the great sigh of the cosmos. Does riding it truly rely on something? If what it relies upon is emptiness, how can one repeatedly attain fortune? If what it relies upon is not emptiness, how can fortune be attained at all—let alone repeatedly? Thus, it is difficult to escape dependence. How much better to move without relying on anything, to be without dependence on externals. Therefore, those who ride the correctness of heaven and earth and harness the transformations of the six qi to wander the boundless—what do they await? Liezi’s riding of the Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed is but the endless coming and going of a single qi, a reliance on riding the wind—yet what does it truly await? Thus, their wandering knows no rest, and its limits cannot be measured, let alone returning after fifteen days. To rest is to return, and to return is never without rest. This is how being rides upon non-being, and non-being governs being. When it reaches the state of neither being nor non-being, the mechanism of ceaseless generation and transformation is fully realized.\n\nIn your studies, you must seek the correctness of heaven and earth and the transformations of the six qi, cultivating them within yourself until, over months and years, form and spirit undergo dark transformation. Then, riding the boundless Corpse-Chariot and Spirit-Steed, the wind moves without needing to be ridden. As for attaining fortune—it becomes something I have no use for. To abandon this and pursue other paths, even if one commands the winds of Feilian and the lightning of Lieque, rides the thunderous chariot of the storm, or traverses the starry roads of the clouds, how can one truly ride anything?\n\nYet all who approach the Dao must cast aside illusion, sever perceptual defilements, make their form like withered wood and their heart like dead ashes. They must regard the world’s treasures as dust and their own weighty bodies as clods of earth. Then, their self-reliance becomes light, and not even the entire world can burden their minds with so much as a hair’s weight. They move as if relying on emptiness, needing no vehicle yet knowing no bounds. Even beyond heaven and earth, their traces cannot be confined.\n\nYou, with your resolute nature and rigorous inquiry, must penetrate beyond being and non-being to wander the carefree wastes and boundless wilds. Like the roaring of ten thousand hollows, the emptiness of all openings—where nothing is heard, nothing is seen—what then are the earthly pipes of the hollows, the human pipes of bamboo flutes, or the heavenly pipes of the myriad winds? Only by listening to the soundless and seeing the formless can one realize that between being and non-being, all is but the myriad winds of a single breath. This is what those who seek the Creator rely upon. Yet I alone have not attained it—strive onward.\"\n\nThe Daoist then asked to adopt this as his name and recorded these words before parting.\n\n**Preface to the Zither Master Zhu Zongming**\n\nMusic’s power to bring harmony extends to the heavens and coils through the earth, moving through yin and yang and penetrating ghosts and spirits. Thus, grand music harmonizes with heaven and earth. Its resonance with things manifests in sound, and sound shaped into patterns is called tone. In tones arise joy and anger, sorrow and delight, exultation and grief, perversity and uprightness. This is why the noble person never parts with the zither and se for even a moment. As it is said: the zither is the essence of music, what the noble person ought to master.\n\nAll that enters the ears and eyes, all that fills the four limbs, must be regulated by ritual, and the zither suffices to dispel perversity, cleanse error, gladden the heart, and nurture the nature—thus attaining the correctness of human feelings. It is no different from the harmonious chimes of jade pendants or the refined sounds of the *Ya* and *Song* odes, which should not be silenced without cause.\n\nFrom the times of Fuxi, Shennong, Yu, Shun, King Wen, and Confucius down to the works of Boya, Qu Yuan, and Song Yu, some compositions arose from sorrowful thoughts, taking shape in mournful sighs or expressions of joy and choice. They begin with faint and distant notes, suddenly surging like anger; they end with a swift, stirring intensity, mournful as grief. In their urgency, they shake the wind and rain, splitting cliffs; in their slowness, they stir waves, rousing dragons. In their grandeur, they spur the gallop of unicorns and the brandishing of shields and axes; in their subtlety, they mimic the drip of springs and the whispers of insects. Their thousand forms and ten thousand postures cannot be fully described. Truly, they can rub against yin and yang and resonate with heaven and earth.\n\nYet to grasp this in the heart and express it through the hands requires long practice—how could it be otherwise? Only by attaining the correctness of human feelings can one preserve the lingering echoes of the sages and worthies. How could it be merely to please the vulgar ears and eyes of the masses?\n\nThe masters of old—Shi Xiang, Shi Kuang, and Shi Wen—are long gone. Those who came after, modifying their teachings—Yongmen Zhou, Sima Xiangru, Cai Dang, Sun Deng, Ji Kang, Huan Tan, and Yang Shou—each excelled in their own way. Among those renowned in recent times for this art are Xu Zifang of Xiaoshan, Yuan Minzhong, and Mao Bozhen. Yang, who studied under Xu and Yuan, rose to prominence in his time as Qi Ling. His *Two Compositions of Jiang* became models, and later generations took Xu and Yuan as their standard.\n\nFrom my youth, I have been devoted to this study. In great cities, whenever I encountered someone skilled in it, I would inquire. Yet most who claim mastery today merely boast of their abundance and compete in extravagance. Those whose tones are bold and transcendent, whose spirit soars to distant realms, are exceedingly rare.\"",

      "translated_text": "The Fujian scholar Zhu Zongming studied under Yuan Ling, a friend of mine. This spring, he came to travel through our mountains, and together we swept the stone drums by Xian Spring. His melodies and tunes were all pure, profound, elegant, and refined—bold and transcendent, soaring and unrestrained—truly beyond comparison with those who merely boast of their abundance and compete in extravagance. In his discussions, he invariably took the attainment of the true nature of feeling as essential. In his youth, he traveled widely, drawing from many sources. At the beginning of our dynasty, he was first recommended to the capital but firmly declined and returned. All the great families and prominent clans of Fujian vied to invite him. Yet only now, in his advanced years, has he attained the subtleties of sound—surely not the work of a single day.\n\nAs the ancients said of \"lofty mountains and flowing waters,\" he found in him one with whom to cultivate the spirit and express the heart amid wind-swept forests and moonlit cliffs. When he departed, how could I not dream of the celestial sounds and surging waves of his music? And what indeed were those tones of *Huangzhong* and *Baixue*? I feared only that my ears could never forget them. As he left, I took up my zither and played *The Debate by the Stream*, strumming twice without ever sensing the sound of parting.\n\nThus, I write this preface as a gift for his journey.\n\n**Preface to \"Roaming the Immortal Crags\"**\n\nI have often observed how people differ in their stillness and restlessness, their toil and ease. Their conduct and speech, their silence and expression, inevitably reveal the inclinations of their nature—how could these be forced? If forced, how could they ever reach the truth of such inclinations?\n\nOur mountain’s Immortal Crags, numbering twenty-four in all, have long been renowned throughout the land. Since the Han-era Celestial Master refined his elixir here, dragons and tigers have appeared in the rocks, lending the place its name. From then on, scholars near and far—regardless of rank, age, or strength—who passed by or made a special pilgrimage never failed to wish for a visit.

      "translated_text": "On the sixth day of the ninth lunar month in the *bingzi* year of the Hongwu reign, I set forth with my academy guests—Master Yang Mengxu, my second brother Zhan Bi, my nephew Wu Ruxu—and our attendants Wang Jingshan, Wu Chuyuan, and Yuan Zhi’an. We ordered a boat to be readied at the creek’s cleansing waters, loaded wine and provisions, then cast off, riding the waves past islets until we arrived in no time at all.\n\nThat evening, we rested to the left of the Crags at the *Yanfa Abbey*, the shrine of the Han-era Celestial Master. Towering terraces and soaring pavilions pierced the heavens, while water curtains draped the altar platforms, cinnabar turtles and mushroom crags arrayed to either side—all offered respite for our repose. The next dawn, we embarked again, the boatmen’s poles and gestures guiding us up and down in ceaseless succession, leaving no leisure to admire the winding paths. Yet among the isles and shores, strange rocks and rare trees, secluded blossoms and exotic blooms flourished in lush, fragrant profusion, each vying in solitary splendor.\n\nSoon we turned toward the shallows, skirting coves where the boat’s hull scraped hidden hollows and jagged crevices—places where only birds could perch or cling, and no human trace could reach. Some coves nestled deep in forests and narrow valleys, sheltering fishermen’s huts; others lay concealed by wild thickets and overgrown islets, where woodcutters’ trails wound in meandering seclusion. This was scarcely different from the Peach Blossom Spring of Wuling. Presently, we paused to brew tea by the stream, drifting downstream as sheer cliffs and precipitous crags reared up in sudden fury—some like leaping dragons and bounding leopards, others like crouching tigers and coiled serpents. Those that bowed low formed natural screens and barriers, while clouds surged and mists billowed in endless transformations. Where hollows gaped in the towering rocks, kitchens, granaries, windows, and weaving looms seemed fully furnished within, inspiring awe and longing as one gazed upward. The mind dissolved, the spirit released, one truly forgot the mortal world existed.\n\nBelow, the limpid pool shimmered in emerald clarity, while ethereal harmonies arose on all sides. Yet above, soaring into the azure skies and brilliant sunlight, only jagged peaks and towering ridges stood—verdant ravines and intricate ridges woven together. In the distance, wild waves and shallow shoals, solemn streams and muddy shallows stretched on without end. After a long while, we disembarked at the base of the Crags, securing our robes to ascend. Suspended boulders hung like canopies over the void, spacious enough to seat dozens. There we laid out wine cups and dishes, drinking our fill. Some recited poetry, others plucked the zither, still others sketched the scene—thus we passed the day in delight, lingering until evening.\n\nJust then, a western wind arose, as if urging us to tread the void and ride the floating clouds, our spirits irrepressible. We ordered the boat to seek the Crags’ right flank, where the *Mingcheng Abbey*—the *Hetu* Immortal Altar of Grand Master Wu—stood. Night had fallen by the time we lit torches to hasten to our lodging. Our host, a descendant of the Wu clan named Congshan, was well-versed in divination and astrology. We conversed through the night, departing the next morning. The poems we composed filled our sleeves, forming a scroll before we knew it.\n\nMengxu then arranged them in order and declared: “Life is for joy alone. These famed mountains and rivers are the dwelling places of immortals and perfected beings—I have heard of them for years. They are no less wondrous than Penglai, Weifeng, Fanghu, or Yuanjiao. Many long to visit but never can. Some hear of them and dismiss the tales as fantastical exaggerations, refusing to believe. Yet today, by good fortune, we have beheld them with our own eyes. The realms of Anqi and Xianmen, the flights of immortals and feasts of leviathans, all lie within a blink’s reach—how could we not count ourselves fortunate? I beg you to preface these works, to record this gathering’s splendor and leave it for posterity.”\n\nI could not refuse and sighed in assent: “Since the dawn of creation, heaven and earth have stood in their places, and mountains and rivers have flourished. These Crags have towered through endless eons, never crumbling. For thousands upon thousands of years before us, who can say how many cycles of rise and fall, growth and decay they have witnessed? How many have shared in this joy? For thousands upon thousands of years to come, who can say how many will know this same delight? Yet those entangled in worldly glory, drowned in mundane filth, buffeted by stormy gloom or the vicissitudes of human affairs—how vast is the gulf between them and those who wander here! This journey, with its pleasures of poetry, music, and song, need not yield to the famed excursions of Red Cliff or the Ke River. How could I remain silent?”\n\nMoreover, the restless yearn for stillness, the weary long for ease—yet how many truly grasp the essence of nature’s truth? Thus, I gladly acceded to his request and composed this preface.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Huanzhen Collection***\n\nThe Dao of immortality has been revered since antiquity. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Way from Guangchengzi, the school of Huang-Lao arose, for Guangcheng was none other than Laozi. Thus began the teachings of immortality. In the Tang, there was Qian Keng; in the Xia, Xiaofu; in the Shang, Wuanqiu; and in the Zhou, Wang Qiao of the Zhou clan—such figures existed even in the Three Dynasties. Yet it was King Mu of Zhou who built a thatched pavilion to receive scholars, bringing their doctrines into prominence.\n\nLater, the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han were deluded by the arts of alchemists and elixirs. Even Wang Cizhong and Dongfang Shuo, though of their time, failed to find true masters. Their heterodox teachings spread and intermingled, ultimately leading to their downfall. Thus, the great scholars and eminent minds of the age rose together to condemn them—rightly so.\n\nYet in the Han, Wei Boyang modeled his *Cantong Qi* after the *Book of Changes*, expanding upon the *Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic*. Through this, the Dao of the Elixir was illuminated, free from the pitfalls of metallurgy, herbalism, cloud-gazing, or breathwork. It clarified the natural principles of body, mind, spirit, and vitality, using the trigrams, lines, and timekeeping to establish its rules—all harmonizing with the patterns of odd and even, images and numbers.\n\nLater, Zhongli Quan transmitted his teachings to Lü Yan of the Tang, who upheld and expounded them in songs, discourses, and debates, nearing the true essence of the tradition. Such figures have never been lacking through the ages. In the Song, Zhang Ziyang, Shi Xinglin, Chen Niuwan, Bai Ziqing, Li Yuxi, and Li Qing’an—all were outstanding masters of their time. Their words and ideas were no less profound than Boyang’s, each achieving deep, silent understanding in their own way.",

Since the Han-era Celestial Master refined his elixir here, dragons and tigers have appeared in the rocks, lending the place its name. From then on, scholars near and far—regardless of rank, age, or strength—who passed by or made a special pilgrimage never failed to wish for a visit. Thus, boats and oars have come and gone without cease, month after month, year after year.",

      "translated_text": "The span of a thousand or ten thousand years—how is it that their words align as if tallying broken seals? This is no coincidence, but the natural outcome. For the principles of a thousand or ten thousand generations remain the same, as do the hearts of men. What causes divergence is invariably the perverse and deceptive doctrines, either contrived to impress the present age or to delude later generations—how could these ever truly accord with the natural Dao of body, mind, spirit, and qi?\n\nThus, the ancients invariably transmitted their teachings only to the worthy, for the Dao does not spread in vain. Moreover, if a master does not guard the profound and abstruse mysteries, refusing to reveal them indiscriminately, while the learner lacks the solid foundation of accumulated merit and cultivated conduct—merely adorning themselves with empty formalities and pretense, no different from those who chase fame and self-aggrandizement—how could they ever speak of the Dao? How could they give voice to its truths?\n\nThe Master of Hunran of Linjiang in Nanchang, once of another surname, was broadly learned. Having encountered an extraordinary person and received secret transmissions, he remained diligent in discourse and writing. I have long read his words, and though we met briefly at an inn, haste prevented a thorough inquiry. This spring, my disciple Yuan Wenyi returned from Wu, bringing his work *The Collection of Returning to the True*, and asked me to inscribe a preface. After savoring it twice, I find it truly conveys the essence of the Golden Elixir and the returning cinnabar, elucidating both the subtle and the manifest, the principle and its application. If one cultivates accordingly, even those who ascend to meet Ziyang or Qing’an may find themselves neither ahead nor behind.\n\nI have long lamented the enduring corruption of superficial, reckless, and heterodox habits in the world, which seem impossible to eradicate entirely. Yet I rejoice that these words may serve to rouse and rectify the ills of this declining age. If steadfast scholars and upright individuals possess the discernment to distinguish fine jade from common stone, then wandering in the primordial radiance of the undifferentiated chaos, refining qi beyond the merging of primordial mists, will be no difficult feat. This is how one fully grasps the return to the origin and the consummation of the end, exhausting the divine and comprehending transformation.\n\nPerhaps one day, I may summon the yellow crane to descend from the skies, and together we shall discuss these matters by the rivers and isles of the Xiang—there is still time.

      "translated_text": "Master Qishan, the Celestial Master of Non-Action, Zhang Yuchu, presents:\n\n**On the *Tai Su* and the Sayings of Liezi**\n\nLiezi spoke of the sequence: There is *Tai Yi* (Supreme Change), *Tai Chu* (Supreme Beginning), *Tai Shi* (Supreme Commencement), and *Tai Su* (Supreme Simplicity).\n\n*Tai Yi* is the state before qi emerges. *Tai Chu* is the beginning of qi. *Tai Shi* is the beginning of form. *Tai Su* is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet undivided, this is called *hunlun* (primordial chaos). *Hunlun* describes the state where the myriad things are intermingled and inseparable.\n\nQi is the origin of form and substance. Before yin and yang separate, its body is *hunlun*. Once divided, it is carved and chiseled, and the *hundun* (chaos) dies—*hunlun* is lost. Yet these three—qi, form, and substance—constantly encompass beginning and end, cycling and interweaving. Outwardly, they appear separate, but in the fleeting interplay of growth and decay, they never depart from *hunlun*. For qi courses through heaven and earth as wind, rain, frost, and dew, as mountains, rivers, and valleys. Within humans and all things, it manifests as the four limbs and the hundred bones. Though creatures fly or burrow, move or grow, each unique in its myriad forms, all are confined by form and substance.\n\nThe beginning of qi, unseen, remains unfathomable. Yet its fullness in substance can be exhaustively explored. The azure of the sky is the true color of the Great Void, pristine and clear. But when darkness and transformation arise in an instant, the azure hue becomes obscured. Without these shifts of darkness and change, the fullness of heaven’s nature cannot be realized.\n\nHumans receive the purity of qi and substance. When passions flare and desires overflow, hardness and softness, good and evil become manifest—this dilutes their purity, mixes their essence, and stains their clarity. Yet if substance were utterly undifferentiated, how could the fullness of human nature be expressed? All things follow this principle. In motion and stillness, advance and retreat, none withhold their nature.\n\nThus, the substance of things, without adornment, lacks splendor. The true flavor of taste, without salt or bitterness, lacks harmony. The subtlety of sound, without pitch and rhythm, lacks concord. This is the inevitable nature of things. Humans must curb desire to return to their origin, so that purity is not diluted, essence not mixed, and clarity not stained. Then the luminous body of pure brightness becomes fully evident. Here we see that our hardness and softness, good and evil, are like heaven’s fleeting darkness and change—yet the original purity of our substance remains unmoved in stillness or motion.\n\nNevertheless, those in the world who uphold this teaching for self-cultivation may nurture purity but fail to wander in *Tai Su*. Without wandering in *Tai Su*, how can they perceive the origin of substance? Substance endures, while adornment decays. Substance nourishes, while adornment pleases. Those who aspire to the Dao must shed adornment to return to substance. By returning to substance, the mind becomes clear, the spirit bright, and inner and outer align in integrity. The myriad things merge in *hunlun* yet remain undivided—is this not perceiving their origin?\n\nThe scholar Lian Taisu of Wudang Mountain’s Five Dragons Palace has studied broadly and conducted himself with rectitude. He has dwelled on our mountain for over twenty years, steadfast in practice, residing in quietude within a single chamber, untouched by the world. My late father once honored him, and since I inherited this teaching, I have drawn much from his inquiries into our Daoist traditions. Could he not wander in *Tai Su* and yet remain thus? This autumn, he wished to return home, and though I urged him to stay, he declined. I said to him: \"From ancient times, famous mountains and rivers have been the abodes of immortals and perfected beings. Why limit yourself to returning here? Yet I have heard this mountain’s wonders surpass all under heaven. Are there not recluses like Anqi or Xianmen hidden within its peaks? Taisu, you should seek their company to expand your *hunlun* and return to the primordial state before the merging of mists, transcending the confines of form and qi. What more would you seek of the origin of substance?\"\n\nAs he prepared to depart, I combined these teachings for him. Lian gladly requested that I record them as a keepsake.\n\n**The Pure One’s Discourse**\n\nAh Jiang’s Zhang Yanhong comes from a family of renowned virtue. Last spring, I visited Xishan and Hua Gai, passing through Ah Jiang on my return, where I first met him. I admired his sincere and earnest demeanor, and in conversation, learned of his fervent pursuit of our Daoist teachings. He has styled himself \"The Pure One.\" Upon his departure, I had no time to discuss these matters. This spring, he came to visit my mountain. My younger brother, Yankui, and I accompanied him to the peaks of Longjing, Guancheng Lake, Pipa, Yuntai, and Miaogu, where we bathed in raging currents and sat upon boulders, roaming as if with heaven itself, forgetting the world of men.\n\nYanhong then asked: \"You once spoke of my name, 'The Pure One.' Now that I have had the honor of this journey, may I inquire into its meaning?\" I pointed to the water and said to him: \"Water is a tranquil thing. From deep sources and hidden ravines, it gathers in a single, limpid pool. Yet when it surges from its lair, leaping and tumbling through a hundred turns, it flows downward for thousands of miles—vast as rivers and seas, narrow as streams and valleys. It rages against rocks, howls in the wind. Though obstructed by thorns, it may be blocked; though fouled by filth, it may be muddied. Fish and dragons dwell in its depths, forests and trees shade its seclusion, wind and rain darken its moisture—nothing can impede its flow. Day and night, it never ceases, its momentum unstoppable, for this is the nature of its encounter.\n\nYet in its essence, it is inherently clear. Thorns cannot block it, filth cannot muddy it. It embraces all yet illuminates all—this is the work of primordial qi. The Dao’s principle of method originates in qi. Water flows between heaven and earth as qi flows within the body. In the space of a single breath, movement and stillness, fullness and emptiness, growth and decay are all present.\n\nThe human heart governs qi. Fundamentally pure and bright, its emptiness and luminosity are like a limpid pool. Yet when it pursues desire and is obscured, moved by external things, if one does not apply the effort to restrain and refine it, it becomes enslaved by the outer world, stumbling and entangled—like water surging from its lair, its momentum unstoppable. Its qi scatters into thoughts, emotions, and desires, becoming blocked and muddied as it should.\"",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the sages and worthies instruct us to guard and restrain the heart, precisely to awaken it from error, restore its flow, and make its seeking akin to water’s response to what it encounters. Its purity and luminosity are never truly lost; the radiance remains, and this is called the Dao in motion, the method in operation. Then, circulating through the six directions of emptiness, moving in harmony with heaven and earth without conflict, it manifests as wind, rain, thunder, and lightning—ever-present as if inherent. Why is this so? For the numerical patterns of the Yellow River and Luo River, the Way of thunder and lightning, and the ceaseless generation of the myriad beings all share a single origin. Thus, to cultivate it is to attain supreme harmony; to apply it is to achieve supreme divinity. Through sincerity, it polishes and refines; through earnest devotion, it penetrates and communicates. Then, the wondrous efficacy of its resonance is as effortless as turning one’s palm.\n\nYet there are subtle and mysterious workings of spirits and gods, rarely spoken of by others, which I also employ. This requires absolute purity to achieve unity; once unified, the Way of nature and destiny is complete—what further method could be needed? Therefore, by observing the nature of things, one knows one’s own nature; by fully realizing one’s own nature, one knows Heaven. Knowing Heaven, the Heaven within oneself is the same as that beyond. In the Way of resonance and communion, who can divide them into two?\n\nThus, those who cultivate inwardly often feign madness or indulge in wine, their laughter and rage alike capable of summoning wind and commanding thunder. Yet how could this be mere happenstance? Yan Hong has thoroughly investigated the profound subtleties of the method and the work of purity and unity, practicing and verifying it through experience—what more need be said? Moreover, I have heard that among his ancestors were those who attained the Dao and transcended the mundane. His deep devotion to this pursuit—could it not be the echo of past cultivation?\n\nYan Hong, take heed. As one who dwells in the same village as the Perfected Lord of the Celestial King’s Court, you must revive this legacy to enlighten future generations. This is my hope. At his request, I have inscribed these words upon the wall.\n\n**On the Learning of the Great Foundation**\nThe great foundation of learning lies in nature and destiny, in the Dao and virtue alone. The heart governs nature and emotion, while nature is bestowed by the mandate of Heaven. The four seasons, five phases, and the transformations of the myriad beings all emerge from destiny. The four beginnings, five constants, and the ten thousand things and affairs all reside within nature. Yet though the myriad things differ, their principle is never not one. Thus, to follow it is called the Dao; to cultivate it is called teaching. Yet one must study to know it.\n\nLearning begins with filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trust, and culminates in the rituals of ascent, descent, toasting, and drinking—there is no moment when one does not learn. The Classics call this learning. It originates in the *Shu Jing*, which states, *\"Study the ancient teachings to gain insight,\"* and *\"Hold fast to the beginning and end, relying on learning.\"* This is the learning of the sages.\n\nThe sages and worthies, fully comprehending the impartiality of Heaven’s principle, possess a body of clarity, purity, and integrity. The foolish and unworthy, drowning in the selfishness of human desire, fall into obscurity, turbidity, and perversity. Thus, those who study seek to remove their obstructions and restore the inherent goodness within. Therefore, one must thoroughly investigate the Way of fully realizing nature and fulfilling destiny, of illuminating goodness and embodying sincerity.\n\nThus, ritual and righteousness serve as its standards and boundaries; speech and conduct are its means of nurturing and reflection. Yet one must honor teachers and befriend the virtuous to attain it. Abide in reverence, act in accordance with righteousness, and over time, it enters the ears, takes root in the heart, and permeates all without exception.\n\nConsider this: Zaofu excelled in charioteering, Yi in archery, Shi Kuang in tuning, Zhui in bow-making, Xizhong in carriage-crafting, and Du in horsemanship. Even in such minor skills, they focused their intent before achieving mastery. How much more so for learning—the work of sages and worthies!\n\nConfucius, though already a sage, did not consider himself one, saying, *\"At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.\"* From that time to a thousand generations hence, who could surpass his sageliness? Yet he still dedicated himself to learning.\n\nIn ancient times, the institutions of learning took different names: in the Tang and Yu dynasties, it was called *Chengjun*; in the Yin, *Taixue* or *Guzong*; in the Zhou, *Taixue* was in the eastern suburbs, and the elementary school was called *Yuxiang*. The Han and Tang dynasties developed these further. Yet even the sage-kings of Tang and Yu never ceased to learn: Yao studied under Jun Chou, Shun under Wu Chengzhao, Yu under Xi Wangguo, Tang under Cheng Zibo, King Wen under Shi Zisi, and King Wu under Guo Shu. Even Confucius once inquired about ritual from Laozi, sought music from Chang Hong, and asked about the *Yi* from Xi Ze. Mencius studied under the disciples of Zisi, and Xunzi under Zou Yan. This is the transmission of the Confucians.\n\nLater, Dong Zhongshu and Han Yu continued this lineage, ultimately seeking the return to the mean, uprightness, benevolence, and righteousness, firmly rooted in self-cultivation. Those who draw from the rich essence of the Six Classics, refined within and flourishing without, are capable of assisting in the generation and nurturing of all things, manifesting the supreme harmony. This is expressed in writing, weaving together the warp and weft to bear the Dao.\n\nThus, the instruments of *heng*, *huang*, *tang*, and *li*, the vessels of *yi*, *ding*, *jian*, and *guan*—without adornment, one knows they are the sacred implements of the ancestral temple. How could they be compared to those who, like thieves of bronze and iron, boast of empty embellishments, competing in ornate carvings and trivial decorations to curry favor?\n\nIf one cannot reach the realm of uprightness, grandeur, and luminosity, but merely vies in the petty and trivial, how can this be called learning? One must grasp its essence and attain completion. Compared to those who gain from teachers and friends, it is as if one had merely memorized formulas or molded clay—achieving nothing without effort.\n\nFor what is gained from within—the subtleties of the Dao, the profundity of learning—fills and illuminates, daily expanding one’s vision. Brocade and embroidery cannot be called splendor; mats, tripods, jade tablets, and sashes cannot be called honor. Even the humblest of silk threads or grains of millet, the simplest of cups or plainest of water, do not diminish the joy of one who has attained this.",
      "overlap_context": ", growth and decay are all present.\n\nThe human heart governs qi. Fundamentally pure and bright, its emptiness and luminosity are like a limpid pool. Yet when it pursues desire and is obscured, moved by external things, if one does not apply the effort to restrain and refine it, it becomes enslaved by the outer world, stumbling and entangled—like water surging from its lair, its momentum unstoppable. Its qi scatters into thoughts, emotions, and desires, becoming blocked and muddied as it should.\"",

Still, the swiftest steed cannot cover ten paces in a single leap, while the slowest horse, through tenfold perseverance, achieves success by never abandoning the effort. Though their destinations may differ in speed, the distinction lies in whether one ceases or persists. Such is the unwearying resolve of the sage.\n\nMy young nephew, so-and-so, is of pure and keen disposition, devoted to learning. He once asked his elder brother, so-and-so, to name his study \"Daily Progress in Learning\" and requested a few words to expound its meaning. As for my own learning, I have merely explored the byways without entering the gate—how could I presume to enlighten him? Yet I urge him to strive on, so that his practice becomes consummate and his conduct illustrious. Then I shall witness his accomplishments, which shall be boundless and immeasurable. This is my explanation, offered in anticipation.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Lady Zixu, the Primordial Sovereign**\n\nThe Primordial Sovereign was surnamed Wei, named Huacun, styled Xian’an, and was a native of Rencheng. She was the daughter of Wei Shu, Minister of Works during the Jin dynasty, and was born in the third year of the Jiaping reign of King Qi of Wei (251 CE). Of extraordinary natural endowment, she read the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi in her youth and soon came to revere the Dao, delighting in seclusion and solitude. At the age of twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu Wen of Nanyang, styled Youyan, by whom she bore two sons, Pu and Xia. Youyan served as Magistrate of Xiuwu in Jijun. Once her two sons were grown, she purified her heart, withdrew to a separate chamber, abstained from food and drink, and resumed her original practice.\n\nOn the night of the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of the ninth year of the Taikang reign (288 CE), the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Divine King of Fusang’s Yang Valley, the Perfected of Jinglin, and the Perfected of Qingxu descended and addressed the Primordial Sovereign: \"Having heard of your secret cultivation of true qi, the Supreme Emperor has commanded us to transmit to you the Way of the Divine Perfected.\" Thereupon, they presented thirty-one scrolls, including the *Treasure Writ of the Supreme Lord*, the *Hidden Book of the Eight Simplicities*, the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and the *Mysteries of the Lofty Immortals*, saying: \"These texts were once bestowed upon the Lord of Total Perfection of the Western City; now we entrust them to you.\" They also instructed her in the secrets of visualization and the essentials of return before departing. At that time, the Primordial Sovereign was thirty-seven years old.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Xianhe reign (334 CE), the Lord of Qingxu and the Azure Lads descended again, presenting her with two doses of elixir and commanding her to ingest them in preparation for a meeting at the Palace of Luoyang at an appointed time. On the night of the seventh day of that month, the Supreme Unity dispatched a terrace chariot to welcome her. Employing the Way of Concealed Radiance, the Primordial Sovereign entrusted her form to the divine sword and transformed, having lived eighty-three years. She then proceeded to Yangluo Mountain.\n\nThe following day, the Lord of Qingxu, the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Divine King of Qingxu descended once more, meeting the Primordial Sovereign at the Cloud Terrace of the Hidden Grotto. Each Perfected imparted their ultimate teachings, and after three days, they departed. The Primordial Sovereign had recited the Jade Scriptures so extensively that her complexion remained that of a young maiden. Thereupon, the Queen Mother of the West and the Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen came to welcome her. Ascending at dawn to the Jade Tower of the Palace of Supreme Clarity, the Great Dao Lord of the Jade Dawn, the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity, and the Later Sage Lord of the Golden Watchtower each issued decrees, bestowing upon her jade tablets and golden writs. She was invested as the Primordial Sovereign of Zixu, charged with overseeing the life-destinies of the Upper Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, her rank equivalent to that of an Immortal Duke. She was further entrusted with governance of the Central Terrace of Tiantai and the Great Huo Mountain, where she would instruct those who sought immortality. The Perfected of the Life-Destiny Office of the Immortals were placed under her jurisdiction in the Southern Marchmount.\n\nThe various Perfected then accompanied the Primordial Sovereign to Tiantai and the Central Terrace of the Great Huo Mountain. Passing through Jinqu’s Golden Altar, they were hosted by the Mao Lords, Shu and Shen, for a two-day feast before proceeding to Huo Mountain.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the sixth month of the second year of the Xingding reign (1219 CE), the Primordial Sovereign and the host of Perfected descended to the Golden Altar of Jinqu at the home of Yang Xi, marking the beginning of the Huayang transmission. Thus, she became the first patriarch of the Supreme Clarity lineage. During the Yuanyou reign of the Song dynasty, she was posthumously enfeoffed as the Primordial Sovereign of Zixu, the Illustrious and Profound Dao of the Supreme Mystery.\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Jin Ye’an**\n\nJin Pengtou, a native of Yongjia, was named Zhiyang and styled Ye’an. His unkempt hair, gathered into a single topknot, earned him the sobriquet \"Pengtou\" (\"Disheveled Head\"). Born into a family of virtuous repute in his hometown, he was resolute and daring from childhood, possessing great aspirations and an untamed spirit. As he matured, he came to yearn for the Dao and relinquished worldly concerns, becoming a disciple of Li Yuexi of the Quanzhen tradition. Yuexi, a disciple of Bai Ziqing, recognized his potential upon their first meeting and dispatched him to travel through Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Chu in search of true teachings.

      "translated_text": "Passing through Yuanzhou, he encountered Dian Junzi, a garrison commander of imposing yet unadorned appearance, who shunned worldly company by day and lodged in spirit shrines by night. Ye’an, struck by his singularity, took him as his master. With time, their exchanges yielded ever deeper understanding.\n\nAt that time, Zou Tingsuo of Zishan, an admirer of the Dao, built the Changchun Abbey and paid homage to him. Shortly after, he entrusted the abbey’s affairs to his disciple Liu Zhixuan and journeyed to the two sacred mountains of Wuyi and Longhu. There, Fu Shizheng, the master of the Xiantian Abbey on Longhu Mountain, lodged him at Penglai Hermitage, situated at the confluence of the ruins of the Recluse, the Sacred Well, and Miaogu Peaks. Ye’an scaled cliffs and ravines, mingled with deer and boars, and slept amidst clouds and mist as though it were ordinary. By night, he would sit upon a boulder, and when serpents or tigers appeared before him, they would startle and flee. Thus he came upon a level, open expanse, where he commanded his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to construct Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak.\n\nAs his reputation for the Dao spread, people from near and far afflicted by illness sought him out. Whatever fruits he offered them proved efficacious without fail, and so those who came to pay their respects grew daily. Once, during a drought, he knocked upon the Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth. The dragon emerged to listen, its form gradually diminishing until it leapt into his sleeve. He admonished it sternly, whereupon the dragon surged back into the water, and rain fell before long.\n\nIn the *guiyou* year of the Yuantong era (1333), he withdrew once more to Wuyi Mountain, residing at the Zhizhi Hermitage of Ziqing. Li Taiping, the Yuan Marshal of Zhedong, heard of him and paid him homage, saying: \"When commands are strict, the lord governs; when the mind is clear, cares diminish.\" Li was all the more filled with reverence and admiration.\n\nWhen the rebel Li Zhifu invaded Zhangzhou, the imperial court appointed Prefect Wu to oversee the suppression of the bandits and named him vanguard commander. Wu’s son, Zhongliang, wished to become Ye’an’s disciple, but he refused. Soon after, the rebels were indeed vanquished. As the throng of spirits and deities grew weary of the constant petitioners, they plotted to poison him. Foreknowing this, he ordered his disciples to dig a pit in the earth, whereupon the poison was expelled. The site is now called the Elixir-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month of the *zhi-yuan* era (1335), his fellow adept Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—attained liberation while seated at Mount Lu. Ye’an soon learned of this. On the tenth day of the fourth month, he instructed his disciples to record his final admonitions and passed away in meditation. Thirteen days later, his face remained as though flushed, and his limbs retained their warmth and suppleness as in life. His disciples interred him beneath an ancient plum tree beside the hermitage.\n\nHe was born on the fourth day of the fifth month of the *bingzi* year of the Zhiyuan era (1276). His foremost disciples—Lao Yansu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\nMang Miaozi remarked: \"The resolute men and righteous knights of old invariably endured hardship and purified themselves to fulfill their aspirations. Thus they regarded the rending of flesh and the breaking of sinew as matters of course, and by their towering singularity, they left examples for a thousand generations. Such was Jin Pengtou. Yet if one seeks to establish a name in the world, one must first attain such resolve—how much more so for those who transcend illusion and transformation? Those capable of such attainment yet failing to achieve the Dao are unheard of. Alas, how few in any age have been capable of this!\"\n\n---\n\n**The Transmission of Zhao Yuanyang**\n\nZhao Yuanyang, whose given name was Yizhen, was a native of Anfu in Ji Prefecture. His ancestors hailed from Junyi, and he was a thirteenth-generation descendant of Zhao Dezhao, the Prince of Yan during the Song Dynasty. His forebear served as magistrate of Anfu under the Yuan and settled there. Yuanyang was precocious in childhood, quick to learn, and adept at recitation. He mastered the classics, histories, and the writings of the Hundred Schools, and in his youth pursued the path of the imperial examinations. Soon after, he sat for the metropolitan examination but withdrew due to illness. His condition persisted, and one night he dreamed of a divine figure who said: \"You are a man of my Dao—why do you seek worldly eminence?\" His father then directed him toward the Dao, and thereafter he became deeply devoted to tranquility and detachment. His learning advanced ever further.",

Where texts were incomplete, he would invariably seek out and verify them in exhaustive detail. Later, he became a disciple of Zhang Tianquan of Taiyu Abbey in Ji, also known as Iron Mystery Zhang, who had himself studied under Jin Yea of Mount Longhu and received the oral instructions for the inner and outer elixirs of golden fluid. Subsequently, he studied under Li Xuanyi of Nanchang, who recommended him to his own master, Master Feng of the Robes of Rushes, who had also been a disciple of Yea. It was said that he once traveled to Yongxing Abbey on White Crane Mountain, the former site of the immortal Kuang of the Western Jin, and took up residence there.

At that time, the Celestial Master Chongxu deeply admired and honored him, wishing to detain him, but he declined. Many of the abbey’s scholars then became his disciples. On his return, he stayed at Ziyang Abbey in Yudu of Ganzhou and settled there. He compiled all the profound principles of the Daoist canon into written works. At times, he composed poems and songs to admonish himself, while also using medicine to aid others.

His lofty conduct and noble character were revered and admired by his contemporaries, and his followers grew ever more numerous.\n\nIn the first month of the year *rentu*, on the first day of the new year, he addressed his disciples, saying: “I shall soon depart.

      "translated_text": "Passing through Yuanzhou, he encountered the garrison commander Junzi of Dian’s army, a man of imposing and unadorned appearance who by day held no commerce with the world and by night lodged in spirit shrines to inquire. Struck by his unkempt head, he took him as master. As time deepened, his words yielded ever greater insight.\n\nAt that time, Zou Tingzuo of Zishan, drawn to the Dao, built the Changchun Abbey and paid him homage. Before long, he charged his disciple Liu Zhixuan with overseeing the abbey’s affairs and journeyed to the two mountains of Wuyi and Longhu. At Longhu, the master of the Xiantian Abbey was Fu Shizheng, who lodged at Penglai Hermitage, a ruined sanctuary at the confluence of Zhengjun, Shengjing, and Miaogu peaks. With disheveled hair, he scaled cliffs and ravines, called to deer and boars, and reclined upon clouds and mists as though it were ordinary. By night he sat upon a flat boulder, and when serpents and tigers appeared before him, they would startle and flee. Thus he came upon a level and open tract of land, where he commanded his disciples Li Quanzheng and Zhao Zhenchun to build Tianrui Hermitage atop the peak.\n\nAs his Dao became renowned far and wide, those near and far afflicted with illness would seek him out. Whatever fruits he offered them proved efficacious without fail, and so those who came to pay their respects gathered in ever greater numbers. Once, during a drought, he knocked upon the Dragon Well and summoned the dragon forth to speak. The dragon emerged and listened; as it grew smaller by the moment, it leapt into his sleeve. He admonished it sternly, and the dragon surged back into the water. Soon after, rain fell from the sky.\n\nIn the third year of the Yuantong reign, he again withdrew to Wuyi Mountain, residing at the Zhizhi Hermitage of Ziqing. Li Taiping, the marshal of eastern Zhejiang, heard of him and paid him homage, saying, “When commands are strict, the lord governs; when the mind is clear, cares diminish.” Li was all the more filled with reverence and admiration.\n\nWhen the rebel Li Zhifu invaded Zhangzhou, the imperial court appointed Prefect Wu to oversee the campaign against the bandits and named him vanguard to pacify them. His son, Zhongliang, wished to take him as master, but he refused. Soon after, the rebels were indeed vanquished.\n\nAs the spirits of the multitude grew weary or sought audience in great numbers, they plotted to poison him. He foresaw this and commanded his disciples to dig a pit in the earth. The poison was indeed regurgitated, and the site is now called the Elixir-Vomiting Well.\n\nOn the first day of the first month of the Zhiyuan reign, his fellow adept Gui Xinyuan—known in the world as Gui Fengzi—sat in dissolution upon Mount Lu. Hearing of this, on the tenth day of the fourth month, he commanded his disciples to record his final words, then sat in meditation and passed away. Thirteen days later, his face remained as though in slumber, his limbs warm and supple as in life. His disciples interred him beneath an ancient plum tree beside the hermitage.\n\nHe was born on the fourth day of the fifth month in the bingzi year of the Zhiyuan reign. His foremost disciples—Lao Yansu, Guo Chuchang, Li Xilai, Yin Pona, and Fang Fanghu—all became renowned in the world for their mastery of the Dao.\n\nMang Miaozi remarked: The resolute men and righteous knights of old necessarily endured hardship and kept themselves pure to fulfill their aspirations. Thus they regarded the rending of flesh and the breaking of sinew as matters of course, and so their towering singularity endured, sufficient to serve as models for a thousand generations. Such was Jin Pengtou. Yet if one seeks to establish a name in the world, one must first attain such a state—how much more so for those who transcend illusion and transformation? To seek such ability and yet fail to achieve the Dao is unheard of. Alas, how few in each generation are capable of this!\n\n**Biography of Zhao Yuanyang**\n\nZhao Yuanyang, styled Yizhen, was a native of Anfu in Ji Prefecture. His ancestors hailed from Junyi; a certain thirteenth-generation descendant of Prince Dezhao of the Song’s Yan Kingdom served as magistrate of Anfu under the Yuan and settled there. Yuanyang was precocious in childhood, fond of reading, and skilled in recitation. He broadly mastered the classics, histories, and the hundred schools of thought, and in his youth pursued the path of the imperial examinations. Before long, he sat for the metropolitan examination but, due to illness, did not proceed. His condition lingered, and one night he dreamed of a divine being who said, “You are a man of my Dao—why do you aspire to worldly honor?” His father then directed him to follow the Dao, and thereafter he became deeply devoted to tranquility and simplicity. His learning advanced ever further.",

      "translated_text": "After a long time, the grasses withered and birds no longer nested there. His disciples, such as Cao Xiwu and Liu Ruoyuan, still entered his chamber to receive instruction. Several of his poems and lyrics have circulated in the world; as for his profound and esoteric discourses, they are recorded in the *Essentials of the Dao*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe writings of the Mystic Gate number in the thousands, and the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship is fully expounded therein. As for the teachings on immortality and longevity, they emphasize nothing more than emptiness, stillness, tranquility, and non-action—truly easy to understand and easy to practice. Thus, those who emerge in each generation to transcend the mundane must uphold austere conduct and lofty integrity. Without exceptional resolve and vision, none can attain such heights. How, then, could one dismiss them as mere delusions of the obscure?\n\nAs for Yuanyang, his words suffice to guide the world, and his Dao suffices to enlighten later generations. How could he not be commemorated? Yet what shines so brightly cannot be extinguished—what need is there for verification?\n\n---\n\n**Letter to Ni Mengchong on the Fire Times**\n\nRecently, you graced my mountain retreat with a visit, and your lofty discourse filled the day, cleansing my withered and rustic heart—how deeply comforting! I had hoped you might stay a while longer, that we might speak through the night amid mountain rains and savor the true flavor of forest and spring. Yet you departed like the wind, leaving me with a lingering sense of loss.\n\nLater, I received your refined composition, and after washing my mind and savoring its depths, I immersed myself in its meaning. Truly, there are moments when silent understanding and heartfelt resonance arise. Your learning is vast and profound—how could I, in my limited capacity, fully grasp or comprehend it? Yet I am precisely the sort who seeks to explore the subtle and delve into the hidden.\n\nRecently, I have suffered unforeseen calamities. Flattery and deceit have grown rampant, and hypocrisy and falsehood compete to arise. The perilous and treacherous circumstances of the time are like fire that burns and water that drowns—nowhere to escape. I have no choice but to endure in silence, feign ignorance, and take blame upon myself. What more is there to say?\n\nAt such times, I have yet to see a single person who remains steadfast and unchanging, upholding propriety and mutual support. Why is it that so many abandon principle and follow the vulgar tide? Even if there are those with talents like Feng Guan or Zhu Bo, they remain mute, watching in silence without uttering a word. For the sake of wetting one’s feet, would one not save a drowning man?\n\nFortunately, with your wisdom guiding me and the legacy of our ancestors’ blessings, I have survived and returned. Yet my illness lingers, and the ways of the world shift like thunder and surging rivers—how could such drastic changes occur? Truly, it is lamentable.\n\nThus, in the midst of adversity, I strive to reflect inwardly, restrain myself, and cultivate virtue with reverence, awaiting Heaven’s decree. This is how the ancients handled glory and disgrace, gain and loss—accepting whatever befell them. Though loved ones may grieve and detractors rejoice, none can sway my heart or shake my resolve. Precisely in times of hardship and peril does one test the strength of one’s progress on the Way.\n\nThus, King Wen was imprisoned and composed the *Book of Changes*; Confucius faced adversity and compiled the *Spring and Autumn Annals*. Even among those who excelled in learning and literature—such as Ban, Ma, Yang, Jia, Han, Liu, Ou, and Su—none escaped exile or demotion. Yet their studies never ceased, and their virtue only deepened. As the saying goes, “Without encountering tangled roots, one cannot distinguish a sharp blade.” This is the truth. Did they seek to embellish their faults to deceive later generations?\n\nAs for myself, I have brought misfortune upon myself through caution, and by anticipating disaster, I have invited it. What else could this be if not fate and destiny? As the saying goes: “Cast a man to the jackals and tigers, and they will not eat him; cast him to the northern wastes, and they will not receive him; cast him to the vast heavens, and they will not accept him.” I have witnessed this firsthand—how could I not feel shame in my heart? Though I am humbled now, I may yet rise in the future.\n\nFortunately, I find temporary peace among streams and rocks, dwelling daily with trees and stones, wandering with woodcutters and herders. Little separates me from a rustic life, yet I am free to indulge my aspirations in discourses on nature, destiny, and the Dao. Compared to those mediocre souls who chase fleeting fame and profit—scheming and deceiving, jostling like flies and ants after carrion—what are their true intentions? Who among them understands the Way of advancing and retreating, living and perishing, following only what is right? They do not consider life and death, success and failure—why then do they scramble for favor and flattery?\n\nMoreover, the mandate one receives from Heaven is fixed. How could the whims of a single person alter it? This is something the world cannot comprehend—it is the common affliction of past and present.\n\nYet your words have deeply resonated with me, and I have much to learn from them. Though my studies fall short, I have lingering doubts—particularly regarding the transmission of the *fire times*. For decades, I have consulted with masters beyond the world, yet few have truly aligned with my understanding.\n\nSome speak of it in wild and absurd terms, dismissing it all as empty—claiming that the hexagrams, lines, and timekeeping are merely frameworks, to be followed but not rigidly adhered to. Others speak of it in profound and secretive terms, insisting on precise details—claiming that the signs, weights, and measures are its laws, to be upheld without deviation. Which of these is correct?\n\nAs for the mysteries of Qian and Kun, Kan and Li; the essence of metal and the sap of wood; the fire dragon and water tiger; the gold within water and the wood within fire; the marvels of reversal and return; the metaphors of the crucible, furnace, and elixir—I have heard them all. Yet I remain uncertain about the hundred days of foundation-laying, the ten-month gestation of the embryo, the mechanism of spiritual transformation after birth, and the precise application of the fire times. Specifically, the true yin and true yang of Kan and Li, their ascent and descent, their ceaseless circulation—this is the unity of the Five Phases and yin-yang, and yin-yang is the Supreme Ultimate.",

      "translated_text": "From the Supreme Ultimate arise the Four Images, and from the Four Images emerge the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams unfold into sixty-four hexagrams, and the sixty-four hexagrams further unfold into three hundred eighty-four lines—endlessly circulating, ceaselessly flowing. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are boundless, none can escape this pattern.\n\nThis is how a single breath in the human body harmonizes with the Dao of heaven and earth, and how humans may steal the mechanism of heaven and earth. Viewed thus, a year has twelve months, a month thirty days, and a day one hundred ke. A month totals three thousand ke, and ten months total thirty thousand ke—within these thirty thousand ke, one seizes the tally of heaven’s thirty thousand years. Each ke of effort corresponds to a year’s seasonal nodes, so thirty thousand ke may seize thirty thousand years. Thus, a year’s twelve months comprise thirty-six thousand units, and within thirty thousand ke, each ke must be harmonized. Should even a single ke deviate, the medicinal ingredients dissipate, and the fire times falter. If the fire’s measure is excessive, it scorches; if the water’s weight is overabundant, it floods. The scorching of fire and the flooding of water must be balanced without fail.\n\nTherefore, drilling years into months, drilling days into hours, within the twelve hours, only one hour is pivotal. One must not be ignorant of the new moon, full moon, first and last quarters, the bathings of purification and punishment, the waxings and wanings, the advancements and retreats. There is a saying:\n\n*The Southern and Northern Schools invert the hexagrams’ images,\nDawn and dusk fire times align with the celestial pivot.\nFollow the day, follow the hour to weigh the measures—\nA hair’s deviation, and the elixir fails to form.\nFrom of old, the commands of geng and jia are made clear,\nExchanging days for hours refines the divine work.*\n\nThe recorded fire times confirm the sages’ adage: \"Transmit the medicine, not the fire.\" And again:\n\n*If the winter solstice does not fall at zi,\nThe great medicine is not measured in jin.\nTrue fire has no fixed time—\nComparing it to mao and you is futile.\nWithin this, grasp the meaning and cease seeking images;\nTo exhaust the lines is to labor in vain.*\n\nThus, the signs and measures are not mere empty words. This must begin with effort and culminate in effortlessness.\n\nAs heaven and earth complete one cycle in a year, the sun, moon, and stars complete one cycle in a month, and the great medicine of the human body completes one cycle in a day and night. Within a single day, yang is born at zi, reaches its peak at si, while yin is born at wu and peaks at hai. Yang begins with *Fu* (Return), and yin begins with *Tai* (Peace). Within a month, the new moon begins with *Zhun* (Difficulty) and *Meng* (Youth), and the dark moon ends with *Ji Ji* (After Completion). From *Xun* to *Kun*, all are hexagrams of the unborn—thus, what comes is met with reversal. From *Zhen* to *Qian*, all are hexagrams of the already born—thus, what passes is followed in sequence.\n\nThe year’s twenty-four qi and seventy-two seasonal markers—this is what is meant by \"one return per month as one revolution, nine returns in a year as nine revolutions,\" which aligns precisely with the immortal masters’ teachings.\n\nMaster Zhu of Kao Ting, however, held that the method of fire times takes the three hundred eighty-four lines as the tally of one celestial cycle, with each line governing a day. Since there are more lines than days, the four trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*—totaling twenty-four lines—are removed to correspond to the twenty-four fortnights. As each fortnight arrives, the fire is gradually increased. Yet within a single day, the tally already completes three hundred sixty units, while the fire added per fortnight amounts to only one line—its weight and measure are incommensurate.\n\nAccording to his method of calculation, the month is divided among twelve hexagrams, each governing two and a half days. Each hexagram’s lines are applied to its own tally. The tally’s quantity, whether greater or lesser, determines the vigor of the yang’s movement or the depth of the mind’s quiescence. Twelve hexagrams complete one month’s work, and twelve months complete one year’s cycle—repeating endlessly without excess or deficiency.\n\nIs this not how the marvels of the *Great Change* perfectly accord with the great elixir? Through this method of withdrawal and addition, advancement and retreat, there must arise the transformations of waxing and waning.",

      "translated_text": "**Admonitions and Inscriptions**\n*Inscription for a Study, with Preface*\n\nIn my youth, before reaching adulthood, I developed a passion for learning and set my aspirations high. I memorized and recited all the words of the former Confucian scholars—every poem, book, and text of the Six Arts. As I grew older, I reflected that my grasp of the literary arts remained incomplete. Thus, in great cities and towns, wherever scholars of learning and conduct were renowned in their time as masters and elders, I sought their company. Thereupon, my reading expanded to encompass the classics, histories, and philosophical works, extending even to the writings of Laozi and the Buddha. The volumes piled up daily, yet only when I synthesized their essential teachings and turned inward to embody sincerity did I realize that all was already complete within me.\n\nOn the discourse of the Dao, virtue, nature, and destiny, from Confucius and Mencius downward, the teachings of Zhou Dunyi, the Cheng brothers, Zhang Zai, Shao Yong, and Lü Zuqian stand as heirs. In the craft of literary composition—from Zuo Qiuming onward through Ban Gu, Sima Qian, Han Yu, Liu Zongyuan, Ouyang Xiu, and Su Shi—no later school surpasses antiquity. If one’s learning departs from the masters of the Zhou and Cheng traditions, it cannot be called true learning. If one’s writing strays from the models of Ban and Sima, it cannot be called true literature. Thus, I reject even finely wrought texts that fail to convey the Dao. The ancients spoke of learning as self-cultivation—how could it be divided into two paths? Pursuing this principle to its fullest, one draws near to the ancient classics and their commentaries. Those who do not probe the root and seek the source—how can their efforts be deemed learning? It is not merely the adornment of rhetoric or the pursuit of rank and emolument. The essence of self-mastery and sincere cultivation lies in aspiring to sagehood and worthiness.\n\nWhat is nurtured within must be cultivated without. In harmony, heaven and earth find their places, and the myriad things flourish. The profound suffices to embrace transformation and traverse the unseen, while the luminous suffices to refine ritual and music and assist in nurturing life. Is this not the way to guide rulers and benefit the people? Such is the great enterprise of ordering the fundamental principles of governance. Yet the path of transcending the world relies upon the words of Laozi, Guan Yin, Zhuangzi, and Liezi. How could it share a road with the harsh legalism of Shen Buhai and Han Fei or the reckless critiques of recluses? As for the singular conduct of the Buddha’s followers—illuminating the mind and perceiving nature—it too serves as an aid to transcending the world. But their heterodox doctrines and deviant practices cannot escape censure; how could one dismiss them all as mere emptiness and void?\n\nAs for later texts on divination, astrology, and omens, I have no leisure to examine them. I regret only that my dull and inferior nature is unequal to fully inheriting this aspiration. I have set aside a chamber to store these works and inscribed this admonition upon its walls as a warning to myself. May it also be passed to future generations to encourage their resolve—let them not neglect it.\n\n**Inscription:**\nSince the dawn of writing and the study of ancient canons,\nThe eternal principles follow their order—\nThe gateway of the Dao and virtue.\nWhen the Supreme Emperor bestowed the celestial endowment,\nThe August One established the ultimate norm.\nThe Mandate of Heaven flows and operates—\nOne must follow its pattern.\nIn purity, sincerity, and clarity,\nOne returns to the origin.\nWhen form is enslaved by things and altered by change,\nWho remains hidden in my emptiness?\n\nOnly the sages and worthies\nHave illuminated their plans and teachings.\nWith careful thought and steadfast practice,\nOne washes away dross and dissolves obstructions.\nEstablishing the body and enacting its use,\nIn movement and stillness, one maintains balance.\nCherishing the essence and savoring the bloom,\nOne manifests it in words.\nThe heart governs nature and emotion;\nA hundred thoughts unite as one.\nExpansive order, lofty chapters—\nThe great tone, the pure flavor.\nDispelling delusion and returning to truth,\nProbing the subtle and attaining the mysterious,\nMists and grime dissolve entirely,\nNever departing from Heaven.\n\nTo gather and dwell in discernment—\nWhat value lies in jade tablets and sashes?\nHold these words dear forever,\nAnd befriend the ancients across the ages.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for an Ancient Zither, with Preface**\n\nSu Kuai’s family possesses an ancient zither, said to have been crafted by Master Lei. Kuai is especially fond of the zither and once spoke of it to Mangmiaozi.\n\nKuai said: “Born late, I cannot fathom the realm of sages and worthies, nor do I harbor ambitions for fame and recognition. My refuge in the hills and forests lies solely in playing the music of high antiquity, responding to the wind in the pines and the springs among the rocks. How is this not a conversation with the people of Fuxi and Shennong’s time? Though I do not match Boya in skillful playing, in your keen listening, are you not the very Ziyou—he who recognized the high mountains and flowing waters? You should compose an inscription for me.”\n\n**Inscription:**\nIts substance moist and clear—\nTo express my song.\nIts form round and square—\nTo uphold my dignity.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for Reverent Silence, with Preface**\n\nMangzi wore a coarse hempen robe and a tattered fur coat, wandering atop Phoenix Terrace. A guest laughed and said to him: “You study the teachings of Master Zhuang—is your knowledge limited to the way of profound silence? Do you also know what we Confucians call ‘reverent silence’?”\n\nMangmiaozi stepped aside and addressed the guest: “Why do you fear this? Is it truly unwelcome, or merely superficial? Our king is virtuous and loves scholars. Since ascending the throne, no discourse on the Dao, virtue, benevolence, or righteousness has failed to enter his ears or reside in his heart. Thus, he pursues learning with tireless diligence and conducts himself with unwavering dedication. He has inscribed the words ‘reverent silence’ in the corner of his seat as a reminder to himself. Now that I have met you, Master Hou, how could I not offer a word to advance your understanding?”\n\nUnable to decline, I composed this and spoke:\n\nThe Dao in relation to things—\nThough heaven and earth are vast,\nAnd the myriad beings numerous,\nWith no distinction between past and present,\nOr day and night—\nIts subtlety and wonder,\nIts refinement and coarseness,\nIts waxing and waning, advance and retreat,\nIts transformations and changes—\nAll accord with the slightest movement of the heart.\nIt can match the utmost greatness of heaven and earth,\nThe utmost multitude of the ten thousand things.\nYin and yang, movement and stillness,\nFollow what has no beginning or end.\nThough the ten thousand differences swirl in confusion,\nThey are truly contained in a single root.\n\nGrasp its essentials firmly,\nAnd hold fast without lapse—\nThen there is no loss in presence or absence,\nAnd one merges with the reality of Heaven’s inherent principle.\nIf one grows lax in grasping,\nOr slack in holding fast,\nThe obscurations of human desire—\nHow swiftly they gallop like a runaway steed,\nCovering a thousand miles in an instant!\n\nYet the work of grasping and holding fast—\nIs it not precisely what we call ‘reverent silence’?\nReverence approaches ritual.\nSincere reverence perfects virtue;\nTranquil reverence preserves one’s position;\nConsummate reverence fulfills its measure.\nThus, ritual is perfected through reverence and only then is there peace.",

outstanding the worthy prince,\nFirm in his self-mastery!\nUnified and preserved,\nHe dares not grow careless.\nIn solemnity and reverence,\nDaily he strives for clarity.\nReverent and silent,\nHow could he ever falter or stray?\n\nLofty his hall’s words,\nMajestic his virtuous teachings.\nNot drawn to extravagance,\nHe draws from what is noble and bright.\nHold fast without wavering,\nGrasp firmly to illumine—\nEver aiding the imperial screen,\nEver broadening virtue’s foundation.\nHis era attains its glory,\nThe imperial favor shines resplendent.\nMay his flourishing wings endure a thousand ages,\nHis great merit eternally radiant.\n\n**Admonition on Concealed Cultivation**\nThe heart’s square inch governs the primordial One,\nBy which it matches Heaven and Earth as one body,\nStands with the Three Powers as their equal.\nHow is this endowment possessed?\n\nIt must be said: Principle is its master,\nThe Ultimate is its depth.\nWithout principle, it cannot stand;\nWithout the Ultimate, it is not complete.\nWithout standing, nothing can be ordered within;\nWithout completion, nothing can harmonize with Heaven.\nConcealment dims its brilliance,\nCultivation disciplines its conduct—\nLest one be no more than a common man.\n\nWho strays from the empty and numinous?\nThus, stillness and unity firm its root,\nVigor and compliance deepen its source.\nFill it with benevolence and righteousness,\nEnrich it with eloquence.\nReturning to seek within,\nIn action, one bears the duty of benefiting the age;\nIn retreat, one guards one’s mystery.\nThis is called “withdrawing from the world without distress,”\n“Abiding in reverence and preserving the center.”\nWhat ancient scholar surpassed this?\nHow dare I rest in aspiring to worthiness?\n\nYet in exploring the Dao of Laozi and Zhuangzi,\nDelving into the words of the Zhou and Shao,\nI temper myself without bias.\nOnly in the steadfast practice of these words,\nMust I daily hold them fast.\n\n**Ancient Inkstone Inscription**\nSu Kuai in his youth loved books,\nAnd treasured an ancient inkstone—\nPurple in substance, white in veining.\nSome called it from Duān or Shè,\nPerhaps it was so.\nHe requested an inscription in stone,\nTo show future generations.\n\n**Inscription:**\nIts substance’s luster arises from stillness as virtue,\nIts veining’s purity arises from silence as constancy.\nIn its capacity alone,\nWriting knows no end.\n\n**Inscription for the Nurturing Nature Studio**\nEmpty and numinous, profoundly clear,\nA deep pool mirroring all.\nThe slightest speck mars its purity,\nAs a raging torrent soils a mirror.\nThe autumn sky embraces the void,\nThe cold river’s moon gleams.\nWho wields the dark mechanism?\nOnly in stillness is there steadiness.\n\n**Inscription for the Retiring and Resting Studio**\nThe ten thousand things share one source,\nThe profound principle is utterly luminous.\nHold fast with sincerity,\nRectify the root and master the self.\nWhen turbidity, delusion, and falsehood arise,\nThoughts and cares swirl in confusion.\nIn movement and stillness, cultivate together,\nReturn to reverent stillness.\nGo forth, scholars!\nAwaken to the sagely words.\nTurn toward dusk to rest—\nOnly in benevolence is one’s true nature.\n\nSolemnly dwell in the vast abode,\nCarefully seek one’s path.\nLet no month pass without vigilance.\n\n**Eulogy for the Perfected Moon Cauldron**\nHis heart roams in the Great Beginning,\nHis traces transcend the empty vastness.\nWhen extended, he fills the six voids;\nWhen gathered, he does not fill a fist.\nNow feigning madness in the mortal realm,\nNow discoursing idly on the dregs—\nThese are but incidental matters.\nA drop may harbor the numinous,\nAs thunder’s charge stuns the rivers.\nWho has glimpsed his body beyond the body?\nHow could one capture his likeness?\n\n**Eulogy for the Gourd and Bamboo Hat Image**\nBorn of an illustrious lineage,\nIn youth he hastened to the gate of learning,\nIn maturity he cherished histories and classics.\nIf one calls him eminent—\nWhen did he ever cast off his cap and sash?\nIf one calls him reclusive—\nHe has indeed rested his head on flowing streams and rinsed with stones.\nWas this not unshaken by poverty or success?\nIndeed so.\n\nOnly in his detachment from worldly affairs,\nHe stands solemn as a lone crane’s cry in clear frost,\nSerene as a deep pool’s cold azure.\nWho would deem this the abode of his vast learning?\nOr rather, does he lodge his lofty purity,\nContent with gourd and bamboo hat for his ease?\n\n**Eulogy for the Confucius Inquiring into Ritual Illustration**\nConfucius and Laozi took different paths,\nYet the Dao shares a single source.\nRitual is what we practice,\nHolding reverence and preserving unity.\nHeaven and Earth’s warp and weft,\nThe canons of Shang and Zhou—\nThe great sound is soundless,\nThe rest is silence.\n\n**Eulogy for Boyi and Shuqi**\nThe Shang declined, the Zhou rose,\nThe mandate shifted with the tripods’ passing.\nThe Dao resides in constant principle,\nSteadfast in benevolence and righteousness.\nWhat endures? What perishes?\nWho discerns? Who obstructs?\nGathering ferns in their seclusion,\nTheir lofty wind endures through the ages.\n\n**Eulogy for the Perfected Lord Wang Chongyang**\nThe Dao flourished at its origin,\nThe mandate shifted with the fall of metal.\nAt Louguan and Zhongnan,\nThe lotus fragrance spread through the lineage.\nA dragon’s bearing in his youth,\nA tempest’s might in his prime,\nVastly he roamed the heavens,\nHis immortal aura gracing generations.",

Moreover, in presenting our concerns to forestall calamity, we dread the unforeseen changes that misfortune may bring—thus we duly prepare this vigil and prayer, trusting in its power to preserve wholeness. With pure sincerity in our offerings of water-plants, we invoke the boundless blessings of the sacred and true. Humbly we submit our inner trepidation, that our red hearts may be secretly perceived.\n\nWe pray that your wisdom and insight shine brightly, that your august compassion be vast and all-embracing. May past transgressions be absolved, all transformed by your molding grace; may peace and prosperity gather from this day forth, all nurtured by your encompassing care. May our earnest words ascend to move the divine, and may the numinous power unfold in secret. May the lineage of the teaching flourish, harmonizing with spring’s warmth to grow ever more abundant; may the imperial realm be blessed with fortune, turning the seasons to timely harmony.\n\n**Green Petition for the Ancestral Offering by the Zhang Clan**\nFrom heaven we receive our nature, and in our hearts we pray to the mysterious vault; from our father we receive our bodies, and how dare we forget the hidden and distant grace? With reverent sincerity we beseech the mandate, trembling as we confess our faults.\n\nWe recall our late father, who was born in an age of flourishing poetry but passed amid family hardship. Bereft of parental guidance, he early suffered the sorrow of loss; treading through brambles and thorns, he barely fulfilled the trust of the garden’s legacy. His birthday drew near, yet the day of his departure came first. The grief of failing to serve him in his final years lingers, and my younger brother’s drowning deepens the sorrow. Though we longed to present our plea through this offering, we were repeatedly hindered by worldly entanglements. Now we undertake this rite of advancement, that he may attain liberation and enlightenment.\n\nWe pray that the red writ may absolve his sins, that the green register may extend mercy. May his innate nature shine clearly, washing away all boundless depths of stagnation; may the light of the Yellow Springs illuminate widely, universally aiding those lost in past delusions. May all sentient beings equally achieve deliverance.\n\n**Green Petition for the Early Morning Offering**\nThe Qian Dao governs heaven, presiding over the norms of the mortal world; the imperial center establishes the pole, opening the ladder of supplication through the mysterious rites. Holding fast to the ancient covenant, we present our sentiments in gratitude.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, inherited the lineage before coming of age, and the burden of office has been profoundly difficult. Though disasters have not repeatedly boiled over, the near loss of heirs has occurred several times. Our resolve has truly faltered in cultivation, and we rely on prayer and exorcism for personal deliverance. Time has passed in delay, and we have circled the jeweled altar ten thousand times; yet your boundless grace has responded to our single sincerity. As we look up to your lofty and profound kindness, we especially hope for your transformative power.\n\nThe morning rites are solemnly observed, and our vows are fulfilled. We pray that your forgiveness be without limit, that your compassion abide in the immortal courts. May you soon bestow a brilliant heir like the spring sun, and may the mysterious teaching’s splendor grow daily, matching the radiance of the celestial luminaries. May vast blessings be bestowed, and great favor universally bestowed.\n\n**Regular Green Petition for the Offering**\nAs heaven and earth cover and bear all, the time swiftly arrives at the birthday; the ritual standards shine forth, and the fast is duly performed to fulfill our long-held vow. Looking up to the numinous, we reverently offer our thanks.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the office for years, yet our self-examination reveals no merit. Driven by anxiety, we have not been fortunate enough to see the restoration of peace; in serving the ancestral peach, we feel keenly the failure to fully succeed. Our morning and evening worries are deeply felt, and our efforts at introspection and renewal are earnest. We have prepared this offering and vigil with utmost sincerity, pouring out our heartfelt devotion before your imperial gaze.\n\nWe pray that the imperial way stand firm as a tripod, that the teaching’s lineage be treasured and upheld. May days bring longevity and health, extending the spring radiance of the mother’s hall; may family and household prosper, opening the orchid chamber to the long light of day. May these blessings extend to the immortal foundation, and may your profound grace descend upon all beings. May age and youth alike thrive in peace.\n\n**Green Petition for the Completion of the Main Palace’s Grand Hall**\nAs the *Yi* reveals the great strength that gives rise to palaces and halls, and the Dao shines with double brilliance as the temple’s construction is completed, we look up in reliance on your encompassing creation and reverently express our gratitude.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the office for years, yet our self-examination reveals no contribution. We have received the emperor’s profound favor, fortunate to be honored with responsibility; through the collective sincerity of all, we have relied on the gathering of gold. The passage of time has been long, and the work of axes and adzes has been arduous. Now that the beams and rafters stand complete, we empty our hearts in this offering and vigil.\n\nWe pray that the imperial realm be as vast as heaven, that the teaching’s standards shine like spring’s radiance. May the people prosper, bringing blessings of longevity and health to all; may tranquility and purity prevail, securing the foundation of this mountain’s peace. May these blessings extend to the lineage’s transmission, and may your profound grace abide in the tripod’s stability. May the hundred spirits guard and protect, and may the five fortunes be universally shared.\n\n**Green Petition for the Purple Tenuity Terrace**\nAs the North Star gathers the celestial bodies, governing the generation and nurturing of heaven and earth, and the Central Heaven administers the world’s balance, we reverently invoke the true rites and respectfully present our heartfelt offering.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have unworthily inherited the lineage and look up to the grace of your edicts. Traveling a thousand *li* to attend court, we have fortunately encountered the succession of the state’s altars; with wholehearted devotion to the imperial sacrifice, we have received the command to offer prayers for our ancestors. The hardships of the journey and the toil of travel have been many, and the delays of the star’s movement have caused concern. Yet our sincere prayers at the jeweled altar have fortunately aligned with the completion of the golden register. Thus we humbly present our repentant devotion and express our gratitude.\n\nWe pray that the Purple Tenuity shine brightly, secretly turning the radiance of auspicious stars; that the Yellow Path open clearly, abundantly extending the blessings of long life. May the teaching’s model grow ever more illustrious, and may the ancestral line thrive in peace.\n\n**Green Petition for the Early Morning Vigil at the Repentance Terrace**\nAs the August Emperor of Heaven governs the mechanisms of creation, and as we revere the vastness of the azure sky, we dread the unfathomable nature of calamity and have earnestly prayed in advance to avert it. The rites and proclamations are complete, and we base our repentance and thanks on sincerity.\n\nWe recall that we, your servant, have inherited the lineage for years, yet our path has been fraught with difficulties. Reflecting on the depth of our transgressions, we have seen repeated sorrows and anxieties.",

      "translated_text": "May the radiant oversight shine forth, as we humbly present our confession of faults in prayer; may the descending gaze remain unceasing, fulfilling the rite of morning audience at the Primordial Altar. With earnest devotion, we submit this green petition in gratitude to the Mysterious Heavens.\n\nWe pray that the August Ultimate may shine resplendent, and the Emperor’s heart take note. May the model of the teaching grow luminous and the household way prosper; may longevity and peace abound. May the verdant chambers of the maternal abode flourish ever green, and the departed harmonize in peach-blossom felicity. May transgressions dissolve like melting ice, and blessings flow like spring’s warmth.\n\n**Green Petition for the Completion of the Universal Salvation Offering on Jia-Shen Day**\nWe recall that the August Emperor establishes the Ultimate, having graciously served through three reigns; yet the Celestial Lord bestows his favor, and we shamefully remain unrefined in even a single virtue. Grounded in sincerity, we offer gratitude and confess our faults.\n\nWe, your servant, have early inherited the immortal lineage and repeatedly encountered flourishing fortune. Yet our transgressions accumulate like mountains, bringing forth the hardships of calamity and adversity; our afflictions deepen daily, making it difficult to preserve the harmony of our household. Our prayers of supplication have been twice prostrated, and the joy of peace has been twice reborn. May the talismanic decree align with the era of *Guanju*’s harmonious beginning, fulfilling the hope of bearing the peach of filial succession. With reverence, we repay our plain vows and extend deliverance to our forebears. Thus, we purify the offerings of fern and delicacies, presenting them to seek the scrutiny of the numinous mirror.\n\nWe pray that the Emperor’s oversight may shine forth, and Heaven’s hearing be most clear. May names be inscribed on the cinnabar tablets, turning inauspicious stars into auspicious omens; may jade talismans convey life, raising the sunken and stagnant from the depths of the unseen. May the model of the teaching be secure and prosperous, and the ancestral line rest in tranquility.\n\n**Prayer Intention for the Ji-Si Offering**\nFortunate is the foundation of past blessings, having early inherited the rank of ancestral transmission; we bear the grace of the state and annually approach the sacred birthday of the Emperor. Yet we dread the great difficulty of audience and the perilous journey through wind and waves. Looking up, we beseech the offering and prayer, having already been bathed in the Mysterious Grace.\n\nYesterday, we petitioned for the removal of external burdens, relying truly on the protection of ultimate fulfillment. Suddenly afflicted by unexpected disturbances, we swiftly returned to safety. We have repeatedly prostrated in repentance and supplication, and together expressed gratitude for the support of creation.\n\nWe pray that the Emperor’s presence may reign above, and the numinous descent be most solemn. May he perceive the sincerity of human desires and forgive the accumulated stains of our transgressions. May the imperial realm flourish like a tripod, daily increasing the radiance of the teaching’s lineage; may the household’s blessings flow like spring, harmonizing with the revival of the ancestral way. May the gates and courtyards endure everlastingly, and peace and trust be universally upheld.\n\n**Annual Prayer Intention of This Prefecture**\nAs the years complete their cycle, we have fortunately enjoyed peace through the four seasons; bearing the axis of the teaching, we strive to repay it with wholehearted sincerity. Moreover, though our faults and regrets have amassed, our vigilance and effort in cultivation have often been lacking. Whether disasters arise from earth and wood or afflictions from human affairs and illness, we have repeatedly presented our prostrations and supplications, and time and again been blessed with preservation.\n\nThus, we dutifully follow the custom of the year-end farewell and respectfully offer our bundles of gratitude. We, your servant, equally rely on the ancestral grace and look up to the favor of the state. We lack the warmth and care of morning and evening, mindful of the toils endured through cold and heat. Without the aid of repentance and release, how could we achieve the averting of faults?\n\nWe pray that our earnest sincerity may ascend, and health and peace be bestowed. May the sacred realm flourish like spring, and the perfect transformation of the teaching be exalted; may the foundation of blessings open in prosperity, and auspicious signs harmonize with the household. May all hoped-for blessings to come be granted by the great benevolence of creation. May longevity flourish like the mother’s orchid, and honor equal the twin blossoms of the hall.\n\n**Prayer Intention for the Offering at the Round Terrace**\nIn the twenty-fifth year of Hongwu, incense was presented at Huagai Mountain. The Emperor’s command graciously descended to seek blessings for the Crown Prince; this humble servant, afflicted by illness, relied on his compassionate mother to pray for peace.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, my office is not one gained through deceit or usurpation, yet I harbor deep concerns about the perils of distant travel. I must examine myself with reverent fear, and seek divine favor through prayer and ritual. May the gods silently assist, and the covenant of this offering be fulfilled.\n\nWe humbly pray that Heaven bestow its boundless grace, and the stars shine with radiant splendor. May the blessings of our household grow ever more vast, and benevolence and longevity ascend together; may the foundation of the realm harmonize with enduring peace, and sagely plans expand without limit. May the mother’s orchid flourish in longevity, and the twin blossoms of the hall exude the fragrance of orchids.\n\n**Intention for the Establishment of the Universal Salvation Offering**\nI reflect that I early inherited the immortal lineage and have repeatedly received the Emperor’s favor. The merits of my ancestors weigh upon me, for I have failed to repay them as my original vow demanded; my words and deeds bear faults and transgressions, and I lament that not even a shred of goodness has been achieved. All is subject to impermanence, and the rise and fall of fortunes remain unfathomable. In addition to fulfilling my earnest prayers, I am ever mindful of the weight of my duties. I rely on this offering for deliverance, that all my transgressions may be absolved.\n\nTruly, the great virtue delights in giving life, and responds with goodness though no words are spoken. We humbly pray that the Supreme One extend compassion from the northern pole, and the southern fire refine and temper. May the jade tally and golden writ swiftly open the clarity of the five portals; may the cinnabar realm and vermilion mound illuminate the nine depths like a torch. May grace extend to all creation, and blessings flow without end.\n\n**Early Morning Prayer for Universal Salvation**\nHeaven is high and Earth profound—how could one forget the grace of virtue? Days pass and months come, as swiftly as the exchange of past and present. I lay bare my sincerity and present my plea, exhausting my heart in this petition.\n\nI reflect that I, though inheriting noble rank, am filled with shame when I examine myself and repent my faults. The debt of gratitude I owe, whether near or far, deepens my sorrow; the hope of deliverance for the departed in the unseen realm urges me to offer thanks without delay. Fearing that my transgressions remain unatoned, I must seek purification through repentance to dissolve them entirely. Thus, I purify this morning offering and fulfill my simple vows.\n\nWe humbly pray that the nine depths release the bound from their sins, and the five sufferings cease their bitterness. May the root of life be preserved, and all attain the fruit of carefree wandering; may they ascend to the realm of true joy, and restore the springtime of growth and renewal. May the radiance of the teaching spread, and the imperial favor bring auspicious harmony.\n\n**Intention for the Universal Salvation Offering in the Jia-Shen Year**\nI reflect that I have unworthily inherited the immortal lineage and enjoyed the favor of the sagely court. Yet my sins run deep, and I have failed to cleanse my faults. My prolonged illness has brought distress to my household, leaving no peace. I knock at the gates of sincerity, hoping the myriad spirits will respond. Humbly presenting this modest offering, I seek to repay the imperial grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the sagely creation shine forth, and the Emperor’s heart hold us in favor. May past transgressions be dissolved, and misfortune swiftly give way to prosperity; may the dark realms be illuminated, and compassionate deliverance bring enlightenment. May the teaching’s influence be strengthened, and the household’s blessings flourish. May all within the realm of cultivation receive life and growth.\n\n**Sincere Intention for the Establishment of the Offering at the Round Terrace**\nThe sun rises and the moon sets, bound by the mechanisms of time. Yin waxes as yang wanes, and I fear that misfortune will leave no peace. I look upward, hoping to reverse the course of adversity, and earnestly beseech the vast Heaven with my prayers. Though the rites have been delayed for four years, a single sincere offering may yet reach the divine. I repay my vows, though overdue, and await the fulfillment of grace.\n\nWe humbly pray that the imperial gaze shine brightly, and the Emperor’s benevolence spread boundlessly. May the teaching’s lineage endure like the mountains, and the five fortunes be fully bestowed; may the ancestral influence flourish like the rose, and a hundred auspicious signs gather. May disasters dissolve like melting ice, and joyous blessings converge in warmth.\n\n**Address for the Raising of the Beam in the Three Clarities Hall**\nWe humbly observe that the Three Realms and the divine continents manifest in the formless above; the Five Sacred Peaks and blessed lands open upon the renowned mountains of the Dragon and Tiger. Though the world has shifted through the dust of kalpas, we now behold the resplendent renewal of this hall. The Emperor’s grace knows no bounds, and the Dao’s transformation is without limit.\n\nWe revere His Majesty the Emperor, whose greatness equals Heaven and Earth, and whose brilliance rivals the sun and moon. His governance establishes order across the ten thousand regions, and his cultural unity extends to the four seas. His magnificent achievements and virtuous power form the foundation of royal governance; his sagely descendants will further expand the eternal imperial plan. The Daoist gate holds him in highest esteem, and this splendid edifice is newly constructed.\n\nWe look up to the Three Clarities and Three Realms Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Perfect of the Formless, the Primordial Lord. You preside as the original honored one of the three realms and govern the myriad heavens. From the mysterious origin, the beginning and completion took form; the pure and luminous coalesced, boundless and eternal. The purple writs and cinnabar texts expound the inner scriptures of the ten poles and nine skies; the golden codes and jade laws unfold the sacred chapters of the seven classics and eight wefts. Thus, the dragon scripts and phoenix seals are revealed, and the tiger guards and simurgh glues convene. The distant gaze turns to the palaces of cowrie and jade, and the towering view encompasses the terraces of elixir and herbs. This hall was completed in no time, and its grandeur is unmatched.\n\nFurthermore, we honor the immortal officials of the Divine Music Abbey, the abbot and supervisor, whose immortal bearing is like the lotus pavilion, and whose demeanor is that of mist and rosy clouds. They tread the azure gates of the purple palace, and lead the grand music of the cloud gates. Their noble efforts in planning have made them the pillars of the mountains and forests.\n\nWe also honor the director of the Daoist Registry, the left master of the Dharma, whose refined scholarship governs the pivotal mechanisms of the Dao; whose breath commands wind and rain, and who holds the secret levers of power. Day by day, they receive abundant imperial favor, and devote their utmost to planning and effort.\n\nMoreover, we honor the mountain-abiding supervisor, Master Li, whose jade carriage enhances the mountain’s splendor, and whose pearl-like virtue enriches the abyss. He explores the mysterious codes of the Dharma sea and assists the teaching’s seat in the pure capital. Together with the assembly of talented administrators and the many gentlemen who contributed gold, their fine reputations and noble aspirations have long shone in this enlightened age; their fragrant praise and virtuous renown resound together in the light of transformation.\n\nThis is the establishment of the teaching through the divine way, where wind and thunder shape its form. Now, the painted pillars and carved eaves gleam in the sky, dazzling the sun. How magnificent are the colorful columns and ornate doors, enveloped in mist and swirling wind! They unite the luminous clarity of the Azure Beginning and merge the true emptiness of the Great Red. The wondrous peaks and sacred ridges resemble the majestic postures of soaring dragons and phoenixes; the layered wheels and towering banners evoke the grandeur of clouds and mist. Fittingly, the myriad spirits gather in homage, and this is indeed a grand design for a thousand generations.\n\nThus, we raise the beam and respectfully offer this auspicious ode:\n\n**East of the Beam**\nFive clouds and auspicious mists swirl in the air,\nThe sun’s radiance illuminates the golden and silver palaces,\nMountains and peaks shine together in eternal glory.\n\n**South of the Beam**\nA thousand peaks and ten thousand ridges pile like indigo,\nRainbow banners and feathered standards...",

      "translated_text": "Floating in the void below, a millet-grain hangs high as the northern face aligns with the Dipper.\n\n**West of the Beam**\nJade groves and jasper grasses rise level with white clouds,\nSacred peaks array themselves in ordered ranks—\nGreen City stands revealed, its ten-thousand-kalpa cinnabar radiance linking to the Great Subtlety.\n\n**North of the Beam**\nElephant Ridge rounds high in a single hue with heaven,\nThe Han Altar’s jade plan and myriad spirits’ reverence—\nFortune marks the imperial decree as all nations pay homage.\n\n**Above the Beam**\nMist-borne chariots and rosy clouds, phoenix and crane in solemn array,\nJade Capital’s ethereal vastness, the Great Clarity’s domain—\nThe gods’ mysterious precincts are not without form.\n\n**Below the Beam**\nCavernous scriptures and divine canons follow wondrous transformation,\nUpon the Void Sovereign’s altar, moonlight shines bright—\nThe Four Numinous Ones surround the true immortal’s carriage.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the beam is raised, the imperial realm will grow ever vaster, and the mysterious teaching will shine with greater splendor. May the four quarters and eight wilds all be bathed in its nurturing grace; may the multitudes of people and all clans partake of its pure and tranquil winds. May the Dao’s domain know no bounds, and the lineage of immortals endure forever.\n\n**Raising the Beam for the Founding Master’s Hall**\n\nWe reflect that when the blazing Han’s teaching flourished, Dragon-Tiger became the abode of divine immortals. Lord Liu’s lineage, marked by jade and scepter, became the model of noble heritage. Long has the celestial palace been revered; how could it resist the turning of kalpas’ dust? Human plans endure, and imperial power renews.\n\nWith reverence, we consider His Imperial Majesty, who opened the Nine-Five diagram and established the primal orthodoxy. With vast vision and towering wisdom, he set the imperial standard to build the center; with abundant virtue and great merit, he governed the celestial offices and bestowed the calendar. The grand foundations of Tang and Wu flourish anew; the flourishing achievements of Han and Tang are now extended. He cherishes the courtly traditions since Yu’s tribute and gathers the harmonies of Shun’s music to institute rites. As heir apparent, he fulfills the people’s hopes for a true and good ruler; as imperial prince, he secures the state and altars’ peace. Rightly do Hua and Yi alike rejoice in harmony, while the Dao’s domain receives exceptional favor. Plans and strategies expand daily, and the pillars of heaven stand revealed.\n\nWe reverently consider the Founding Master, the Orthodox Unity, Profound and Mysterious, Tranquil and Responsive, Manifest and Protective True Lord—whose Dao is revered in the mysterious court, whose teaching unfolds in the Pure Capital. With divine might like wind and thunder, he truly crowns the three mountains’ eminence; with cap, sash, sword, and pendants, he manifests the source and flow of an illustrious lineage. He accumulates blessings for the state and people, nurturing fragrance in descendants. Through the earthworm’s humble service, he receives the celestial court’s favor, suddenly magnifying the divine edifice’s majestic gaze. A thousand years’ grand design is now a single moment’s magnificent sight.\n\nMoreover, we consider the worthy generals and ministers, the talented men of Min’s walls, and the great virtues of the four directions—all sharing an era’s glorious radiance. The Dao resides here, and the utmost spirit knows no bounds. The six directions follow heaven’s warp and earth’s weft; the five cities’ walls are attended by sun and clouds. Once, dragon-officials were driven to transport magnificent timber; soon, crane-borne decrees sought azure tiles. Wondrous wood was completed in the moon’s palace; southern gold arrived at the cloudy court. The Purple Capital’s twelve heavens transformed into Peng’s gates; the Jasper Capital’s thirty thousand households were moved from Fang and Ying. Truly, it resembles a conch-shell palace and cinnabar terrace, vast as the medicine steps and jasper halls. The isles of Feng and Lin, spring-warmed, revolve; the banners of phoenix and crane, their music resounding, descend from the Nine Clarities. Rainbow ranks and mist-borne carriages gleam like lightning, brushing the heavens. Without mountains and rivers’ majesty, how could the master and minister’s dignity be displayed? By the land’s elevated brightness, it fittingly crowns the admiration of humans and heavens. Thus, numinous spirits guard and escort, wind and thunder ever accompany the immortal capital; while pearls and jades shine brilliantly, the starry Han ascends to the imperial abode. Jade missives and gemmed scrolls—only Ge’s might compare; jade lotuses and golden stalks—perhaps Mao’s mound could rival. As we receive the forty-third transmission and rebuild for the fifteen-hundredth generation, though divine work is trustworthy, it is also the land’s numinous power that brings this to pass. Seizing the moment, it is completed in no time. With reverence for the six wefts, the twin beams are raised.\n\n**East of the Beam**\nLight divides the luminous peaks, the Dao like a dragon—\nSpring returns to the calendar, the morning mound’s beauty,\nAll within the nurturing harmony of the long-lasting wind.\n\n**West of the Beam**\nThe immortal terrace’s peaks rise level with clouds,\nJasper pools and jade trees stand beyond mist and rosy glow—\nAt times, celestial script descends in purple clay.\n\n**South of the Beam**\nDust Lake soars high, rivaling Hua’s balance,\nCloud banners and mist standards array in emerald ranks—\nThe sun guards the White Jade Casket of eternal life.\n\n**North of the Beam**\nThe Dao’s ancestor soars beyond all reckoning,\nIn crimson robes and fish-scale armor, solemn in layered heavens—\nSince ancient times, the Han’s house has been the immortals’ abode.\n\n**Above the Beam**\nThe ranked emperors dwell in a thousand-fathom vastness,\nNuminous lords pay timely homage, roaming the Great Clarity—\nThe Jade Treasury’s pivotal mechanisms are passed down through generations.\n\n**Below the Beam**\nTigers guard, dragons soar, phoenix carriages array,\nJade script shines bright amid the five clouds—\nFor kalpas without end, emptiness knows no day or night.\n\nWe humbly pray that after the beam is raised, the sagely lifespan will be as long as heaven, the imperial realm will flourish like a tripod, the heir’s glory will be magnified, and the world’s peace will be secured. May meritorious names rival Xiao and Cao’s; may household legacies emulate Yang and Guo’s. May the maple’s reach extend across rivers and seas, the mysterious wind flourish upon grand foundations; may virtue shine like coral and jade, the teaching’s lineage grow ever more prosperous in the imperial vessel. May the ancestral altar endure forever, and the Dao’s transformation know no bounds.\n\n**Raising the Beam for the Three Gates**\n\nWe reflect that Dragon-Tiger’s famed mountain marks the blessed land of pure emptiness; Feng and Lin’s separate isles open the vast gate of the Dharma. After yesterday’s flames of separation, today’s reconstruction begins anew. The Dao’s model is made manifest, and divine transformation is made clear. We look up to the three realms’ exalted ones and the ten directions’ assembled sages. The Founding Master, the Orthodox Unity, Profound and Mysterious, Tranquil and Responsive, Manifest and Protective True Lord—who initiated the Orthodox Unity’s ancestral wind and unfolded the Mysterious Origin’s wondrous transformation. Possessing the strategic advantage of mountains standing and rivers flowing, he expanded the celestial warp and terrestrial weft’s guiding principles. Precious scriptures and jade texts extended the fifteen-hundred-year immortal lineage; pearl palaces and jade towers honored the twenty-four administrations’ divine merit. The gate channels the sun and moon’s passage; the door mirrors heaven and earth’s opening and closing. Its beauty is splendid, its majesty imposing.\n\nMoreover, we consider the divine music’s immortal officials and the abbot’s guiding presence.

      "translated_text": "**A General Explication on the Transmission of the Three Primes**\n*Composed by Celestial Master Zhang Yu Chu of Mount Longhu, the Perfected of Non-Action*\n\nThe Great Void is profound and boundless, its subtle pattern obscure and minute—so ultimate it defies speech, so wondrous it eludes thought. Before sound or scent, form or name, the vast Brahman of the Qi River stretched empty and lightless. In that time, scripture had not yet arisen; it was inconceivable, immeasurable.\n\nWhen the Crimson Clarity unfolded its chart, heaven and earth were born, and the ten thousand existences took form. A hundred thousand layers of Dao-darkness coalesced into cloud-script, issuing forth as numinous texts. Only then did the myriad patterns unfold, the Five Canons scatter forth, preserving and regulating the kalpas, enduring with heaven itself. The transmission among true sages remains one in principle.\n\nFrom the Primordial Beginning’s discourse on the scriptures in the suspended millet-pearl radiance, the assembled perfected oversaw the conferral upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, and the Great Pattern first unfurled. After the Kaihuang era, the Great Vehicle of the Numinous Treasure was again transmitted, along with the *Purple Tenuity’s Flying Celestial Ten Divisions* and the *Primordial Beginning’s Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Red Writ Jade Chapters*, the *Chaotic Vastness Primal Nothingness Numinous Text*. The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavern Yang’s Hall, smelted it in the Flowing Fire’s Court—thus the Primordial Beginning Numinous Treasure’s mysterious root, the Cavernous Void’s spontaneous true writ, which generates heaven and establishes the pole, enlightens the divine luminaries, deploys its numinous might to pacify the Five Peaks, and brings peace to the realm and well-being to the people.\n\nTherefore, the Most High expounded the Jade Bureau, and the numinous writ spread forth. Then our Han Ancestor, the Celestial Master, descended in response to the transformation. In the first year of the Shanghuang era, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the Most High Lord of the Limitless Dao inscribed the Eight Upper Transformations. In the first year of the Limitless era, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he inscribed the Eight Middle Transformations. In the second year of the Limitless era, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he inscribed the Eight Lower Transformations.\n\nIn the second year of Han’an, on the fifteenth night of the first month, he was moved by the Golden Watchtower’s Later Sage Primordial Dao Lord, who descended upon Mount Heming in Western Shu. There, he conferred the *Secret Register of the Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Capital for Cultivating Perfection and Prolonging Life, with Flying Transformation*, along with the *Elbow-Behind Scripture and Oral Instructions*. In the seventh month of that year, he established the Twenty Western Treaties and transmitted them to his successor. Then, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, he founded the Four Treaties to correspond with the Twenty-Eight Constellations. Thus, the Treaties encompass the Twenty-Four Qi, and each Qi governs Twenty-Four Offices. There are Twenty-Four Male and Female Officials, and Twenty-Four Male and Female Offices. Upon receiving their appointments, they follow the statutes and regulations to govern households and transform the people.\n\nThose who delight in the Dao and rejoice in the law, whose hearts are single-minded and wills unwavering, are delivered from calamity and granted extended years. They subdue the perverse and return to orthodoxy, dispel harm and expel demons, rescue the living and deliver the dead. In the highest degree, they may ascend in spirit and tread upon radiance, transcend ranks and attain perfection, ensuring that the teaching of the Three-Five endures for endless kalpas, and the true wind of Orthodox Unity flows without cease.\n\nThus, those who receive the transmission face the deities of the Treaties and deliverance, standing before the altar to divide the registers, thereby manifesting the gravity of the covenant. The Dao Lord once declared: “When I descended to the Shu capital, the Twenty-Four Treaties were all prisons of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, known as the Bureaus of the Dark Registers of Yin Radiance. There, I opened the Jade Dawn Palace of the Purple Yang Southern Court and conferred the *Secret Register of the Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Capital*. From it, I obtained the Way of traversing the Celestial Stem and treading the Dipper, the essentials of the Three Steps and Nine Traces.”\n\nHe once told the Ancestral Master Perfected Lord: “The Dao of Orthodox Unity was born from the primordial chaos, before the dark and yellow had taken shape, when purity and simplicity still prevailed. As the Great Simplicity began to scatter and the frivolous wind daily encroached, I feared the Dao-folk would be led astray by the perverse, the primordial qi would become mixed and confused, ghosts and demons would entangle them, calamities would arise wantonly, and they would fail to attain the true Dao, their heavenly years cut short by harm. Thus, I descended the Alliance威 tally to covenant against external perversity and rectify the internal primordial darkness—hence the name Orthodox Unity. Those who invoke it perceive the Dao of the undivided source. Therefore, this method is the gateway to all methods, encompassing the Upper Clarity’s Ten Transformations and Nine Changes, the Great Red’s *Hidden Writ of the Three-Nine Plain Words*.”\n\nThe Ancestral Master Perfected Lord also once instructed Perfected Wang: “The primordial darkness of the Chaotic Origin is fundamentally one. One generates two, two generates three—these are called the Three Primes. Three generates four, four generates five—these are the Five Phases. These Three Primes and Five Darknesses weave heaven and earth, transform the myriad things. Thus, the method of Orthodox Unity is born from the primordial darkness, dynamically transforming through the Five Phases—hence the name Three-Five Method. Those who uphold it align with the Three Primes of the Imperial Lords, stabilize the Five Phases, guard the principles of sun and moon, rectify the luminous and obscure, follow the sequence of thunder and lightning. There is no reckless movement in wind and clouds; the ten thousand things flourish in moisture. The realm knows no toil of warfare, the people suffer no afflictions of pestilence. Such is the great resonance of upholding the Orthodox Unity method.”\n\nThe Perfected Lord first dwelled in Songyang, then traversed the famous mountains east of the river, following the great gorges. Entering Shu, he subdued demons and vanquished specters, dividing the dark prisons into Twenty-Four Courts of Blessing and demoting the demon marshals to Twenty-Four Yin Officials. There, he encountered the Primordial Dao Lord, who again conferred upon him the *Orthodox Unity Alliance威 Way*, the *Three-Eight Flying Immortality and Life-Prolonging Arts*, and invested him as the Supreme Mystery Capital Orthodox Unity Perfected, assuming the Later Sage’s position of the Primordial, becoming the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center. He was enfeoffed as the Lord of the Supreme Mystery Capital Orthodox Unity Pacification Darkness Palace.\n\nUpon pacifying the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens and completing his cultivation, the decree of the Three Heavens descended, and he ascended in broad daylight, taking his place among the Nine Clarities. Thus, the transmission of the Twenty-Four Rank Secret Registers all subdue the perverse and return to orthodoxy, greatly flourishing the numinous transformation to bless the myriad people. They descend the darkness of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, cultivate the governance of the Twenty-Four Darknesses, wear the talismanic cords and seals, command the generals and officials of the Treaties and Systems. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the Three Officials endorse and recommend them. Their names are inscribed in jade, they undergo corpse liberation and transformation, ascend to the rank of Perfected, and their seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessing. Hence, the transmission of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements’ scriptures and registers expands and propagates the secret and wondrous, universally delivering the boundless.",

      "translated_text": "The above serves to safeguard and secure the nation’s destiny, ensuring it endures with Heaven, while below it bestows blessings upon the living and the deceased, so that all under Heaven rejoice. Thus, within the Purple Yang Inner Palace, the *Jade Dawn Orthodox Unity* secret canon unfolds and expounds the profound and subtle—rightly so.\n\nTo this day, after forty-three transmissions, it has received the sacred favor and flowed forth from the ancestral altar. Now, on this auspicious festival of the Upper Prime, the day when the Heavenly Officials review the records, the chief disciple of the central altar, [Name], presents golden offerings in devotion, beseeching the descent of profound grace. Practitioners from the ten directions, adorned with talismans, gather at the ancestral altar. Thus, the high companions of the Dharma ocean, the pure assembly of the lecture hall, purify body and mind, desiring to hear the supreme Dao.\n\nAs the scriptures say: “From the void and spontaneity the Dao arises; the True One is undivided, its essence serene. Round and luminous, self-sufficient, it does not fall into views, far removed from dust and defilement. Learning is no-learning, cultivation is no-cultivation—within this, all is clearly understood. Neither departing nor abiding, neither death nor birth—this is true awakening.” How could this not be deeply and brilliantly evident?\n\nCultivated inwardly, it is the Dao of the Golden Elixir’s return to the Three and Five; applied outwardly, it is the wondrous efficacy of the *Numinous Treasure’s* Ten Revolutions of the True One. Expounded, it becomes the texts of the *Purple Pivot* and *Flying Sanskrit*, the records of the *Cinnabar Scripts* and *Numinous Charts*. Universally delivering heaven and humanity, its merit is boundless. Thus, the transmission of the Supreme’s various scriptures and registers, originating from this, fully encompasses the Dao of responsive transformation.\n\nFor the pivot of creation can transform our people—like Heaven descending and Earth ascending, encircled by sun and moon, activated by thunder and lightning. Its mechanism operates without speech, yet benefits the parched and gives life. Thus, those endowed with humanity are neither enhanced by wisdom nor diminished by folly; it lies in turning inward to seek the inherent goodness, moment by moment returning to the real, pure and undivided. Only then, embracing the mysterious and guarding the One, restoring simplicity and preserving the true, are the Dao of fulfilling one’s nature and destiny fully realized.\n\nTherefore, the myriad things share a single root, moving in harmony with Heaven and Earth without conflict. The Dao’s foundation lies in emptiness, tranquility, stillness, and non-action. Applied to family and state, extended to heaven and humanity, there is no realm where it does not prevail. Its responses to the two realms (spiritual and mundane) all arise from the true texts and numinous talismans, which avert calamity and bring forth auspiciousness—truly, there is a reason for this.\n\nThus, its benefits extend beyond merely blessing the living and the dead. Bathed in the Supreme’s nurturing grace, its boundlessness is assured. Tonight, ascending this Dharma seat, the High Perfected of the Celestial Court bear witness to the covenant. The six realms of existence and the four sagely ranks form the audience. Briefly expounding these teachings, may profound awakening be attained.\n\nAll good and faithful people, all sentient beings, may you equally ascend to benevolence and longevity. May none remain bound in the unseen, but together reach the shore of the Dao. Having stood long, take care.\n\n*Universal Refining and Deliverance: A General Exhortation*\n\nWe have heard that the wondrous precepts of the *Cavern of Perfection* and the jade texts of the *Numinous Treasure* uphold the nation’s destiny for ten thousand years and deliver the suffering souls from the vast kalpas. Their prohibitions are most solemn, their divine power beyond thought. They universally deliver the departed spirits who, having long transgressed the true Dao, willingly endure cycles of retribution. First, the sacred milk of the Dharma must be widely proclaimed to illuminate their true nature, that they may swiftly awaken and early depart the dark paths.\n\nOriginally, before the beginning of the Limitless, prior to the Great Origin, there were no signs, no omens. Then the Great Simplicity first dispersed, yin and yang first divided, Heaven was established and the pole set, the myriad things were born and nurtured, the Three Powers stood together, and humanity dwelt among them. Yang transformed and yin united, the Five Phases congealed, the Two Qi circulated. All things, born together with Heaven and Earth, equally received the One Qi and took form. With form came endowed nature—this is the flowing of Heaven’s mandate.\n\nWhen the Three Luminaries shine together, the Five Peaks stand in majesty, the wonders of thunder and the teachings of rain and dew—nothing, from the vast to the minute, lacks the fullness of innate knowledge. There is no single thing that does not possess this Supreme Ultimate. The divine Dao establishes teachings to deliver the world and transform humanity—only this.\n\nThus it is said: “The Dao of Heaven and Earth is undivided in its manifestation.” In Confucius and Mencius, it is called benevolence and righteousness; in Śākyamuni, perfect enlightenment; in Zhuangzi and Liezi, emptiness and non-being; in Xunzi and Yangzi, the balance of power; in Ban Gu and Sima Qian, literary expression. Flowing into the hundred crafts and thousand arts, it does not depart from the inch of the heart. Though paths differ, the return is one—myriad things share a single root.\n\nYet Heaven and Earth and all existence are bound to form and qi, confined to the cycles of arising and ceasing, flourishing and withering, formation and decay. Human life, with the stirring of consciousness, is assailed day and night by incessant disturbance, never a moment’s rest. Ears hear, eyes see, mouth tastes, heart thinks—all are obscured by desire, entangled by emotion, seized by circumstances, lured by objects.\n\nFor nature flows into emotion, emotion blazes into thought, thought accumulates into anxiety, anxiety endures into consciousness. Thus, within the seven apertures, the six desires and five aggregates, the three poisons—all greed, anger, hatred, love, joy, resentment, conflict, and opposition—entangle and bind, growing ever deeper and more fixed. One sinks into the dust of the root-qi’s single boat, bound by clinging thoughts, even to the point of owing karmic debts through love and desire, forming enmity. Mistaking strangers for kin, enmity and kinship intertwine, mutually avenging. Thus, the body’s senses arise, and circumstances follow the mind’s birth.\n\nAll adverse and favorable, good and evil circumstances, with the slightest movement, become obstacles. With form comes the sprouting of a single thought, pursuing delusion and illusion. For a hundred thousand kalpas, the turning never ceases—rising in the east, setting in the west, emerging and submerging. Even wood and stone, without memory, are constantly moved, all due to a single thought’s deviation. Thus, a thousand lifetimes of suffering arise, one’s spirit sinking, drifting, scattered, and confused, with no end in sight.\n\nAt first, the skandhas of form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness seem real, giving rise to the retributions of heaven and hell. Yet they know not that earth, water, fire, wind, sound, and form are all empty flowers.",

      "translated_text": "Delusion.\n\nSince the vast kalpas of primordial chaos, through the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, suffering and affliction have been boundless. Thus, the Great Unity above, possessing the virtue of cherishing life, opened the gate of expedient means, arising in great compassion to universally guide all beings, enabling them to abandon delusion and return to truth, equally attaining the supreme fruit of the Dao, gaining immeasurable blessings, and forever emerging from deep delusion.\n\nCarefully examined: The Primordial Celestial Unity, the Most High, suspended a precious pearl in the Azure Heaven of Beginnings, summoning the thousand perfected ones to expound the precepts of the Mysterious and Yellow qi. All entering into formation, abiding, decay, and destruction are created by the mind and veiled by wind, the four great elements merely a temporary convergence. All that possesses form is but illusion; only the formless is perfectly luminous, eternally unfolding its wondrous teachings. These were transmitted to the Jade Emperor, the Numinous Treasure Dao Lord, and thus the Three Grades of the Numinous Treasure Dao emerged.\n\nNext, they were passed to the Five Elder Thearchs and the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct. King Zhen of Jade Purity opened the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, issuing the talismanic decree to shatter hell. The Great Emperor of Azure Splendor opened the Left Mansion of Azure Splendor, issuing the Nine Dragons Talismanic Decree. The Venerable Lord Han opened the Vermilion Spring Mansion of Spring, issuing the Talismanic Decree to Deliver Souls from Darkness. The Three Assisting Perfected Ones opened the Yellow Register Court, issuing the Yellow Register Perfected Talismans. Thus, the Three Masters of Antiquity, through the *Millet and Pearl Scripture*, expounded the arcane texts of refinement and deliverance, liberating the souls of the dead and extending blessings to the myriad kinds.\n\nThe Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy transmitted these to the Grand Pure Dao and Virtue Celestial Worthy, who in turn passed them to the Great Recluse, the Master of Myriad Things, who entrusted them to the *Flying Celestial Jade Scripts of the Ten Divisions*, thereby unfolding their subtleties in an unbroken lineage. By the Han dynasty, our ancestral Celestial Master received the transmission of the Orthodox Unity, its texts still flourishing.\n\nAt the beginning of the Han, the *Chaotic Red Writ of Brahmā’s Net*, inscribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, consisted entirely of cavernous numinous talismans. Above, they safeguard the turning of the kalpas and eliminate the three disasters; below, they refine the souls of the dead and deliver the living. Universally proclaimed to the boundless divine realms, the Northern Metropolis of the Yellow Springs, they swiftly erase the ledgers of sin, extinguishing the roots of evil. Then, demon kings offer protection, earth officials escort the departed, and souls are delivered from the earthly gates to ascend as perfected beings.\n\nYet, as the world declines and customs grow shallow, the arcane texts and profound canons remain hidden in the celestial treasuries, transmitted but once every forty thousand kalpas—only to those who have planted numinous roots in past lives. How could their boundless wonders be carelessly revealed? Their mysteries are of the utmost gravity; how could the negligent or arrogant fathom their subtleties?\n\nTheir wonder lies in delivering people. The merit of delivering others is often heard from the immortal masters: \"The Numinous Treasure is the Golden Elixir’s treasure.\" If metal and wood remain separate, water and fire estranged, how can nature and life merge, returning to the origin and restoring the root? One must establish the cauldron and vessel of heaven and earth, refine the medicinal substances of Kan and Li, capture the leaping hare, unite the black dragon and tiger, gather the primordial True Unity’s qi as the foundation, and take the mechanism of yin-yang’s movement as the model. In motion, it arises from the Nine Yangs; in stillness, it follows the sixty-four hexagrams as the fire phases of the celestial cycle. The circulation adheres to the three yin and six yang, yet the Numinous Treasure’s completeness lies in the Numinous Treasure.\n\nThe Golden Elixir is the Numinous Treasure; the four lines of the hexagram serve as the tally for ascent and descent. The wonder of inversion, the mechanism of reversal—extracting mercury from cinnabar—though myriad sages may ponder, none can fully grasp it! Thus, even the slightest deviation cannot be tolerated; the wonder lies in the Dao of the Three and Five returning to One. Open the crescent moon, move the celestial root, circulate along the ecliptic through the celestial cycle. Discern the embryonic spirit’s transformation in the dark chamber, the mysterious merging into form, refining and returning to truth.\n\nOf old, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign attained the Dao of the Nine-Five, and the Lords of the Five Thunders attained the Dao of the Three-One, differing not from this. For the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing* reveal the root of heaven and earth’s generation. As for the Numinous Treasure: spirit congeals into numinosity, qi gathers into treasure. One must gather the qi of the primordial chaos and profound darkness, refine the essence of the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit, traverse the Southern Dipper, cross the Eastern Well, activate the true fire of utmost yang, and descend the yellow essence of great yin. Thus, Kan’s lunar essence and Li’s solar radiance merge, the five qi circulate through the celestial cycle, form arising from the formless, ascending directly to the Vermilion Numinous Realm.\n\nThis is the universal deliverance: the dead refined, the living delivered, souls crossing the Vermilion Numinous Realm to undergo refinement and rebirth. It is the emptiness of the One symbolizing the Supreme Ultimate, returning to non-being. Thus, the perfected cultivate it to refine themselves and extend it to deliver others. It is indeed the true yang of heaven and earth, transmuting yin spirits, ceaselessly ascending and advancing.\n\nKnow then that the Numinous Treasure is another name for the Golden Elixir. You, suffering souls, have endured kalpas of torment. Now, through the merit of the assembly leader [Name], the supreme great fast is established, a celebration of a thousand lives, allowing you to bathe in the Dao’s compassion and be instantly delivered. Having heard these wondrous teachings, they will forever become the seed of sagehood within you.\n\nYour dharma-body of self-nature is originally without defilement, without birth or death. Yet, deluded by false illusions, you remain without awakening. The scripture states: \"The beings of the three realms are originally without transmigration; the True Unity’s qi is originally without birth or death. The苦 sea is boundless; turn your head, and the shore is near.\" Thus it is said: \"When understood, karmic obstacles are fundamentally empty; when not understood, one must repay past debts.\"\n\nIf the wise hear or see evil, they must know and awaken to it, sweeping it away. The foolish, lacking all aspiration, blindly wander in darkness and must urgently awaken. Those in wealth and nobility are entangled in every thought; those in poverty and lowliness cling to every thought. Having created these karmic causes, how can they escape the cycle of rebirth?\n\nTherefore, the masters of former times ceased all activity, like cold ashes or dead embers, withered wood or stubborn stone. Only by stilling this single thought can one illuminate all delusions, not clinging to a single speck of dust.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, there is no beginning to coming, no end to going—birth is fundamentally non-birth, death fundamentally non-death. The wondrous existence of the single spirit endures eternally in an instant.\n\nThis arises from love as its root and accumulated thoughts as its karma, giving rise to manifold rebirths and manifold karmic retributions. Through a thousand lives they revolve, through ten thousand kalpas they suffer, ceaselessly turning without self-awareness. Disciples of the four assemblies, receiving the deliverance of departed spirits: I speak without tongue, you listen without mind. In that realm beyond speech and hearing, awaken fiercely—ultimately transcending all conditions, surpassing all illusions—then the three karmas and six senses will be instantly purified. Turning back, you suddenly realize that all past entanglements of suffering and joy are fundamentally unattainable. In this direct recognition, you realize that originally there was no birth, and now there is no death. Even the search for entanglements yields nothing—how much less do all deluded thoughts of existence and non-existence remain?\n\nDo not assume this was possessed before birth and lost after death. Whether from kalpa to kalpa, abandoning one body to enter another, you remain indestructible. It is only your own delusion. If you clearly awaken to your inherent nature and contemplate your wondrously pure, luminous mind—radiant and numinous—it transcends speech and silence, movement and stillness, and clings neither to existence nor to boundaries. Like a mirror polished of all grime, the moon appears in the still water. The emptiness that is not empty is true emptiness; the thought that is without thought is right thought. In every movement, thorough illumination; in every thought, perfect interpenetration—truly, \"a thousand rivers hold water, a thousand rivers hold the moon; ten thousand miles without clouds, ten thousand miles of sky.\"\n\nIf you do not shatter these barriers, you will forever remain in the old rut. You must directly perceive and bear witness—do not let this moment slip by. A hundred thousand Dharma gates, infinite wondrous meanings—all converge in a single moment of awakening. From this, when not a single thought arises, all conditions become still. Even the sins as numerous as grains of sand vanish, and only this original face remains—the true immortal and Dao ancestor. How then could there be hells or evil destinies, or the ceaseless suffering of rebirth?\n\nWhen this ultimate realization is attained, all illusions are empty, and the One Reality alone manifests. The vast emptiness is without form—this is your true nature. Having heard this Dharma sound, the assembly suddenly awakens, recognizing their original true nature. They turn from the cycle of rebirth and never regress. Constantly guarding and upholding this, they become vast and perfectly luminous, utterly free from obstruction. Gazing upon all forms, what remains? Thus they transcend the Three Realms and wander freely in the Upper Clarity.\n\nYet for those souls still mired in the lower realms who have not fully realized the true and constant, it is fitting to transmit the precepts to prevent their fall. With reverence, the Nine Wondrous Precepts are proclaimed one by one. First, take refuge in the Three Treasures, that they may have a foundation. Let the departed souls of the netherworld be instructed, and let each uphold them.\n\n**Transmission of the Dharma, General Exposition**\n\nIn the beginning of the Great Ultimate, the primordial chaos first divided, and from this arose the separation of yin and yang. Heaven and earth took their places, and the ten thousand things were nurtured. The Five Phases emerged, and the myriad transformations were born—thus, generation upon generation, transformation upon transformation, without end.\n\nThe Five Phases are but yin and yang; yin and yang are but the Great Ultimate. By the flowing movement of Heaven’s mandate, it bestows upon the ten thousand things their nature. When nature sprouts, principle is inherent within; when principle manifests, emotions appear without—all governed by the life and death of yin and yang, the ascent and descent of the Five Phases. Thus, water and fire clash, thunder and lightning strike, hardness and softness grind, the eight trigrams interact. Stirred by thunder and lightning, moistened by wind and rain, the workings of yin and yang are overseen by the divine ruler.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the ten thousand things are governed by the Emperor. Yet movement and stillness have no origin, yin and yang no beginning. In the human heart, this ruler is called the Emperor; its wondrous functioning is called spirits and gods. The vastness of heaven and earth is bound to yin and yang—how could it lack a ruler? This is what is meant by the Emperor.\n\nThe ancestral lineage of our Dao traces back to the Primordial Heavenly King, who, after the Opening of the Imperial Era, transmitted the Great Vehicle of the Numinous Treasure, the *Scriptures of the Ten Departments of the Purple Tenuity Flying Heaven*, to the Jade Clarity Great Dao Lord and the Nine Divine Empyreans of the Divine Empyrean. Later, descending upon Mount Emei, he bestowed upon the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign the methods of refinement and deliverance. At the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Nine Yangs of spontaneous qi emerged. The Primordial Beginning commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to take up the brush and compose the text, which was concealed in the Cavern of Yang. When the Vermilion Numinous Fire Treasury was opened, the scriptures for reviving the dead and restoring life were entrusted to him—thus, the *Scriptures of Millet Pearls* unfolded into the texts of refinement and deliverance.\n\nDuring the Dragon Han kalpa, the Dao Lord was also bestowed with the wondrous and mysterious Dao of Pure Tenuity, while the Elder Lord received the inner methods of the Primordial Response. Thus, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy transmitted the *Perfect Formula of Pure Tenuity and Mysterious Penetration* to the Heavenly Emperor of Wondrous Transformation, and the Most High transmitted it to him. Our ancestral Heavenly Master of the Han orally transmitted this as the Orthodox Lineage of Pure Tenuity. Later, in the Yuan dynasty, it was presented to the Imperial Consort Yuan, the Radiant Ancestral Mother, and thus unified as the *Pure Tenuity, Numinous Treasure, Dao Virtue, Orthodox Unity*.\n\nThe Perfected Xu of the Great Ultimate cultivated the Dao and attained realization. By the command of the Most High, he was entrusted with the *Ten Wondrous Scriptures of the Numinous Treasure*. The Perfected Xu transmitted them to the Three Assistant Perfected Ones, under whose charge all matters of deliverance were placed. The Three Assistant Perfected Ones transmitted them to the Left Palace Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate, from whom the lineage of the Numinous Treasure flourished and spread. Those who propagated its teachings—such as Du, Lu, Ning, and Zhang—achieved the greatest prominence. Among those who transmitted it to later generations, none were more eminent than the two patriarchs, Lin and Bai. This is called the *Emergence of the Cavern Real, Deliverance of Humanity*, provisionally named the *Primordial Beginning*; the *Succession of the Cavern Mystery*, alternatively called the *Numinous Treasure*; and the *Elaboration of the Cavern Spirit*, named the *Dao Virtue*. Though these three differ in name, in reality they are one.\n\nFormerly, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy commanded the Perfected King of Jade Clarity to open the Vermilion Numinous Fire Treasury, the Great Emperor of Azure Radiance to open the Left Treasury of Azure Radiance, and the Venerable Lord Han to open the Right Treasury of the Vermilion Numinous. The Three Assistant Perfected Ones opened the Yellow Register Court and produced the talismans of the *Jade Clarity, Earth-Prison Breaking*, and the texts of the *Three Writs and Five Talismans*. In all practices of refinement and deliverance, when proclamations are issued to the netherworld gates, none fail to awaken.",

      "translated_text": "The above is called the *Divine Empyrean*, descending from the *Limpid Tenuity*; all these are its texts. Thus, the Supreme Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Perfected King, the Great Emperor of Longevity, exclusively governs the Nine Empyreans and the Thirty-Six Heavens’ Worthies. The Thirty-Six Heavens’ Worthies are solely commanded by the Great Emperor, who oversees the primordial configurations and holds dominion over yin and yang. Therefore, the administration of thunder and lightning is entirely subject to him.\n\nFormerly, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign attained the Way of the Nine and Five. The Scripture states: \"One who attains the Way of the Nine and Five becomes the Emperor of Thunder.\" The Five Thunder Lords thus obtained the Way of the Three-in-One Thunder. Three is the ancestral number of the East, and One is the generative number of the North.\n\nThe Immortal Master said: \"The Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign revealed the utmost truth, manifesting the Three and Five to deliver ordinary beings.\" In the *Numinous Treasure* teachings, the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the solar essence and lunar spirit, ceaselessly ascend and descend in the interplay of yin and yang. The method by which the dead are refined and the living delivered lies in using one’s yang spirit to refine their yin souls, thereafter harmonizing yin and yang to return to the Supreme Ultimate, merging nature and destiny to revert to the primordial origin. Thus it is said: \"Congeal the spirit into numinosity, gather the qi into treasure.\" Spirit is nature; qi is destiny. For the Empty Cavern descends numinosity, the Great Void generates spirit, and the Golden Womb of the Void is the true within the true. Therefore, the spirit and qi are concealed within the Three Fields and Five Viscera, drawing from the celestial *Ren* and *Hao* constellations. By repeatedly tasting the sweet dew, one gathers emotions to restore nature, gathers nature to return to the root. With water and fire in mutual completion, the Way of nature and destiny is perfected.\n\nThus, the Dao draws upon the sun and moon within oneself, and the method follows the symbolic patterns of water and fire. With one’s own luminous yang nature, one awakens the yin spirit of the other. Borrowing the qi of the Nine Empyreans and Nine Yangs, one refines the substance and purges the form, riding the compassionate radiance of the Supreme Emperor to dispel the darkness of the Nine Springs. Only then are sins extinguished, the spirit made whole, and transformation into life achieved.\n\nThe Wood of the East Three combines with the Fire of the South Two—this is the dragon reborn in fire. The Metal of the West Four combines with the Water of the North One—this is the tiger reborn in water. Wu and Ji are the Earth of the central intent, the marvel of the Three and Five united as One. Precisely as it is said: \"With Kan and Li in mutual completion, all returns to the center; only then does one realize the merit of the Three and Five.\"\n\nAs for talismans, registers, writs, and incantations, as well as the protocols and ritual texts, these are the graded ranks of the Dharma-gate, serving as the ladder and ferry for entering the Dao, the direct path to seeking the true. If one does not seek it within oneself, how can one use the merit of self-cultivation to deliver others? Upon investigation, the ultimate principle is never not one.\n\nThe Five Thunder Lords, having attained the Way of the Three-in-One, manifest the wondrous function of the Two Dipper Stars, which is the numerology of the *River Chart*. Thus, the Three-in-One is no different from the Nine and Five. For the pivot of yin and the mechanism of yang, thunder is good and lightning is fierce; yang thunder and yin lightning together govern the Seventy-Two Bureaus of Thunder. Thus, the *Kui* and *Ji* constellations serve as the offices for summoning thunder and dispatching lightning.\n\nIn thunder and lightning, the central qi of Heaven and Earth is obtained. Jia and Geng are the commands of thunder and lightning, which is the function of the Nine and Five. Ren is the configuration of thunder, Bing is the convergence of thunder, and Zi is the origin of thunder. Thus, Zi is the first configuration of thunder, Mao is the gate of thunder, Wu and Gui are the offices of thunder-fire. When combined with the cyclical transformations of *Yanlü*, *Shunshen*, and *Gengshen*, all derive from the marvel of the Nine and Five. Through the Fire Master Wang the Perfected and the Perfected King of the Awaited Palace, the transmission of the Thunder Mother was fully revealed.\n\nHumans, endowed with a single numinous spirit, together with Heaven and Earth form the Three Powers. The transformations of a single body’s yin and yang proceed in unison with Heaven and Earth without deviation. Alas! A single point of numinous clarity illumines Heaven and Earth; from ancient times to the present, none have recognized it. The Confucians call it \"empty numinosity without obscuration,\" the Buddhists call it the \"wondrously pure bright mind.\" Directly awakening to it, it is neither mind nor one; suddenly encountering it, it is neither Zen nor distant. The Scripture states: \"Heaven issues its fierce mechanism, Heaven and Earth overturn; when Heaven and humanity are aroused, the old foundation is transformed.\" That which is called \"humanity’s convergence with the Dao\"—is this not the pivot of yin and the mechanism of yang?\n\nWhen humans align with Heaven, harmony is achieved through the balance of yin and yang. Ghosts and spirits are the spontaneous functions of the Two Qi. By employing the mechanism of one’s own opening and closing to command them, this evokes and that responds. It begins with the Great Brahma’s primordial void, prior to the *Hun Dun* Red Script. Thereafter, the Five Classics unfold, and the myriad norms expand. The Five Scripts open and extend, universally establishing the numinous spirits. Thus, there is no scripture that does not deliver, no scripture that does not generate life.\n\nIn great matters, it can safeguard and stabilize the nation’s destiny, verify the Dao, and attain perfection. In small matters, it can protect oneself, pacify the household, aid others, and benefit all things. All are the comings and goings of a single qi, the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases. With one’s own primordial spirit from the infinite kalpas, one commands the spirits of the formless void. When spirit and qi unite, qi arrives and numinosity follows.\n\nThus, it is said: \"Do not depart from the present moment’s constant clarity; seek to know the lord who cannot be seen.\" The establishment of the Dharma-gate of the Divine Empyrean for a single day is like the palm encompassing yin and yang, the executioner issuing commands, the messenger stirring the Milky Way, the thunder gate exchanging the movements of water and fire, the *Cavern Mystery* opening and closing the yin and yang, the Earth Lord strategizing the killing of spirits and deities, the arrow-killing techniques piercing the stellar luminaries. Below, there are the texts of Deng and Yue; above, there is the qi and the incantation. Thus, the divine methods of the moon and the divine techniques of the law are all derived from the wondrous functions within oneself, not merely from paper talismans and bodily postures. The method is the function of the Dao; the ritual is the vehicle of the method. The myriad spirits are but a single movement of the primordial Great Dao. When employing one’s own primordial spirit, filling it expands to pervade the Six Voids, gathering it contracts to not exceed a handful. How could the minute and the vast not be one? When one spirit moves, the myriad spirits follow.\n\nThe Immortal Master said: \"Establish the Dao, and the method is also established; establish the method, and the Dao is also established.\" For embryo respiration, use the apertures; in every method, the heart must be able to penetrate the heart. Then one knows that gathering this is the true essential marvel of the method. Therefore, those who engage in cultivation must first investigate the wondrous function of the Mysterious Pass, the true source of water and fire, and the marvel of returning to the root and restoring destiny. Only then can one unite the myriad in the one, and the hundred considerations converge into one.",

      "translated_text": "Should one fail to inwardly illuminate one’s nature—comprehending the celestial Dao and the thunderous heart-ground—how could one still the flesh to refine the golden elixir, or move like a thunderclap? Yet one must first temper conduct with resolute integrity and forge the path with diligent perseverance.\n\nThe Master said: \"Within the real dwells the spirit; beyond sincerity, no method exists.\" Thus, preserving sincerity and nurturing qi form the essence, while penetrating the wondrous and seizing the mechanism serve as function. If one can embrace the origin and guard the one, steering darkness to congeal the spirit, the six senses dissolve into purity, the true singularity emerges, and I become the Thunderous Great Dharma King—what need remains for talismans, incantations, or secret formulas?\n\nThough ascending to the Three Realms and transcending the myriad illusions may seem arduous, it is not so. The power to benefit and aid extends even to the mud-pill and mugwort, for both may lodge the handle of darkness and spirit. Thus, conversing and laughing amidst the wind and thunder are but trifling matters for me.\n\nYet the mysteries of transmission and reception, the secrets of talismanic script—all are inscribed in the golden statutes and jade regulations. Were they not transmitted through celestial descent, one by one, would there not arise the peril of beginning with zeal and ending in neglect? Therefore, the wondrous treasure of celestial truth is passed down through kalpas, with the descent of the celestial true origin governed by solemn vows and weighty covenants.\n\nNow, the disciples beneath the altar, blessed across a thousand lives to ascend the immortal ranks, have received the lofty and profound transmission in accordance with the statutes. Thus, this numinous canon is expounded so that they may know the source from the stream, seek the root and discard the branches, and turn inward for an ever-abundant teacher.\n\nLet none dare to treat these teachings with frivolous leakage or negligence, lest they violate the prohibitions. One must instead refine conduct with discipline, delve into the profound mysteries, and persist in cultivation without cease. As object and self are forgotten and spirit and illumination merge as one, shall one not tread the luminous path to transcendence and unite with the Great Void?\n\nAfter all, before heaven and earth divided, where did the brush first touch?

      "translated_text": "**On the Restoration of the Yifa Guanzhou Monastery**\n\nThis monastery’s origins trace to the late Han, its foundations laid in the early Tang. By the flourishing Yuan, after centuries of decline, it had undergone repairs—yet the labor was vast. We now humbly appeal to the virtuous, entreating their aid in recompense, that this noble endeavor may be fulfilled.\n\nIt was the Celestial Master who descended as the Star of Literary Brilliance, cradled in auspicious clouds of lotus and kingfisher silk. The mountains, steeped in the numen of Liang and Chu, harbored dragon-tiger omens. The temple halls first rose in the Han, the palace courts flourished in the Tang. Through twelve hundred years, the twenty-four sacred precincts saw the Dao’s lineage grow ever more revered, the true wind ever more resplendent.\n\nAlas! Storms and time have shaken its beams, leaving corridors to crumble and hemp to overgrow. Though the transmission of the teachings demands restoration, it is also the duty of true disciples to forge karmic ties. With brushstrokes that summon spring, may we witness Wang Chang’s peaches ripen anew; with vows made beneath the moon, may Zhao Lang’s tripod gleam once more. Let these halls of mother-of-pearl and pearl be no different from the cinnabar terraces and purple palaces. Let names be inscribed in the *Record of Longevity*, that blessings flow endlessly; let merits be recorded in the *Great Possession*, that auspicious order prevail. May the mystic wind endure forever, and the nation’s destiny know no bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Petition for the Restoration of Jing Tong Hermitage**\n\nJing Tong Hermitage was the cultivation ground of the Thirty-Third Celestial Master, the Perfected Lord Xu Jing. Born in the Xihe reign of the Song, he once gathered disciples atop Rounded Mountain, his merit and conduct resplendent. By the Chongning era, Emperor Huizong’s veneration of the Dao reached its zenith. Alongside the imperial attendants Wang Wenqing and Lin Lingsu, he enjoyed singular favor—his prayers and sacrifices to the cypress groves yielding wondrous signs. Soon after, the Song court fell, and the Perfected Lord, like his peers, attained liberation through seated transcendence. His surpassing deeds are fully chronicled in the records.\n\nYet the hermitage, built between the Song and Yuan, has suffered repeated devastation by war and fire, its reconstructions many. With the passage of years, its structures have inevitably decayed. Though this mountain’s restoration should take precedence, our strength is insufficient—we must rely on the collective karmic ties. Thus, we present this humble petition to the benevolent and generous, entreating their gold to accomplish this noble work. May the Perfected Lord’s numinous assembly, together with the multitude, bestow undying grace.\n\nThe Dao was honored when the Han court established the thirty celestial transmissions; the teachings unfolded when the Song dynasty penetrated the five thousand words’ mysteries. At the height of Emperor Huizong’s reverence, in concert with the illustrious attendants’ merits, he stationed brave generals in the palace courts and banished demonic dragons from the tides. Azure dragons and white tigers stood like emerald bamboo and jade parasols; red horses and vermilion sheep remained in the green annals and purple archives. Having adorned this hallowed ground, we must not forget the toil of its decay. To renew it, we must seek the aid of the wellsprings of generosity. As cranes return to the Liaohan Sea, may we gaze again upon the solitary flight toward the jade pavilion; as crows transform over the Sizhou Isles, may we rejoice in the towering splendor of the Jasper Terrace. Together, let us contribute to imperial favor and share in the numinous blessings.\n\n*End of Volume Seven of the Jianquan Collection*\n*Volume Eight of the Jianquan Collection*",

distinctions arose,\nAlternating in marvelous pairs to form the Five Phases.\nThe sun’s charts and the earth’s records took this as their rule,\nEstablishing the Three Poles as the measure of all things.\nNow bending, now rising in boundless expanse,\nThey vie in length through the work of creation.\nWhen the Three and Five wondrously unite,\nThey coil like the pivot of a wheel, congealing

millet hangs in the void,\nMajestic as clouds ascending and rainbows gleaming.\nEmbrace the compass within the hidden abyss!\nExpand the floating vessel to harmonize the pure.\nThe heavens and earth revolve in cyclic gestation,\nHarmonizing descent and ascent like the turning of a wheel.\nBathe in the Sun Valley and ascend to the imperial,\nSoaring on mighty winds in boundless flight.\nUrging forth the linked stalks of wisdom’s harvest,\nI pay homage to the Radiant Lord in his dazzling splendor.\nSipping jade nectar and cassia wine,\nI am veiled in the lush fragrance of jasper beams.\nThen he bestowed upon me the words: \"Vast and formless,\nTranscend the tranquil vastness beyond the faintest echo.\"\nThus I cleanse this great defilement,\nReturning the dark essence to its hidden store.\nI mount the dim and frail carriage of the black-robed one,\nDriving the six black steeds in their lush array.\nPiercing the bright with the fullness of the dark,\nI rein in my pace to move as a single breath.\nHow endless the cycles of beginning without end,\nSwirling and eddying in ceaseless transformation!\nI aspire to soar afar and attain it,\nFor only then may I savor the pure and true.\nPine and Paulownia, long-lived and proud,\nWhat kinship have they with the common cypress?\nYet do they truly trust in fleeting life,\nLurking in the hardships of cliffs and valleys?\nTheir wills stand firm as ice and frost,\nWhile the illusory world is but drifting dust.\nHow can splendor be called beauty?\nMired in filth, what room is there for debate?\nAlas, my life is fraught with dullness,\nMy aspirations lingering in past fragrance.\nThe tangled threads of ancestral teachings,\nDampen my heart’s unspoken longing.\nI yearn to delight in the great transformation,\nYet my balance beam is broken, my hidden thread concealed.\nI cast aside indolence and lay down my staff,\nKnocking at the vast gate to seek the ford.\nI renounce the early cravings of mulberry and river,\nFor the great sound resounds like a distant echo.\nWhy treasure the gourd as a jewel,\nWhen what use are the tripods of Shang?\nI lament the discord of handle and socket,\nAs if my nature were estranged from its former fragrance.\nWhy still cling to the glow of fame,\nSighing in weariness for fleeting glory?\nWho does not fortify their resolve?\nEven the ancient sages prized steadfastness.\nYang Xiong guarded the mysterious,\nPraising the root and cherishing the hidden gate.\nQu Yuan’s *Far Roaming*,\nAlso preserved its vital qi within.\nDredging the turbid to await the empty,\nI rinse my mouth and hesitate.\nGazing afar at the distant corners of the world,\nI should follow purity and shed my husk like a cicada.\nOnly Jia Yi’s lament for the roc,\nUnderstood life and death as no cause for concern.\nHow much better to ride the limpid wind,\nAnd reach the lightning’s strike without harm!\nCast off the excrescences of the self,\nFor what are things but fleeting bubbles?\nFalling like morning stars in desolation,\nOnly a trace of light lingers and fades.\nI grieve the dusty altar’s crudeness,\nWandering alone in sorrow and dismay.\nI weave orchid sashes to leave behind,\nPlucking ivy and dodder to untie my bonds.\nI long to follow the fragrant steps,\nYet the lofty flight remains distant, and I am but a guest.\nI gather dew upon chrysanthemum blossoms,\nMoved by their purity, my form grows faint.\nI equal self and other in a grain of rice,\nUnconcerned by the desolation of the road.\nI gaze up at the soaring phoenix,\nWhy begrudge its virtue’s radiance?\nFearful of the lame tortoise’s plodding,\nI ride the glue-bound axle without reins.\nI seek to knock at the Red Mound,\nYet who knows the mystery of wordless silence?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of Qishan\"**\n\nAt the mountain’s peak,\nNone gaze upon the tortoise.\nThe trees of Mount Lu,\nUnscarred by axe or adze.\nIn the mountain’s seclusion,\nI dwell alone.\nMy will left behind,\nThe world sees only me.\nWhen the imperial first arose,\nAlas, where was I to witness it?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of the Woodcutter’s Return\"**\n\nI nest in the forest,\nWho sees my cares?\nLong have I yearned,\nHow dare I not follow?\nThose who cherish the ancients,\nOnly guard their constancy.\nI gather firewood,\nWhy let it be felled and harmed?\nThat ox has its lush pasture,\nWhy should I weigh its worth?\nThe world knows not my heart,\nWhy mourn my voice?\n\n---\n\n**The \"Ode of the Orchid Sash\"**\n\nThe orchid’s fragrance,\nIts essence pure and clear.\nI would wear it,\nWho sees my thoughts?\nNear or far,\nFrost and snow cannot rend it.\nOn land near at hand,\nOnly brambles and thorns thrive.\nI plant it in seclusion,\nGrieving its hidden bloom.\nHidden, oh hidden,\nDo not lift your fragrance,\nDo not display your beauty.\n\n---\n\n**Imitating \"The Spirit’s Release\"**\n\nThe heavens’ edge is distant and hard to fathom,\nMyriad things surge in endless flux.\nThe supreme principle melts into the great wheel,\nOne root branches into all creation.\nThe empty and numinous governs the subtle pivot,\nThe dark mechanism turns in nurturing poison.\nWaxing and waning alternate in ceaseless play,\nThe mysterious and vast embraces all beings.\nLuminous and clear, spanning the first beginning,\nHow can dust and defilement be bound?\nLife and death are not two paths,\nShort and long are but fleeting constraints.\nThe ancient immortals Pine and Paulownia,\nRode their steeds in carefree roaming.\nI long to follow them,\nYet my lonely flight lags far behind,\nBound to the dusty altar.\nHow can I shed its filth,\nMolding my form like a cicada’s molt?\nDrowning in the foam, I yet lead my kind,\nGazing afar, I dwell in the six bones.\nWhat use are excrescences,\nWhen the hidden truth knows no bounds?\nThe abyss is clear, desireless,\nWho says it is blind to joy or fear?\nDay and night, I am ever buffeted,\nVast and empty beyond heaven and earth,\nMy breath like a flickering candle.\nA thousand ages cast their lingering light,\nThe supreme spirit shines forever bright.\n\n---\n\n**Expressing My Feelings**\n\nAlas, within the vault of heaven and earth,\nA single breath swells in boundless might.\nThe cosmos fills the eight directions,\nThe empty and numinous abides in true awakening.\nEphemeral splendor gathers like moths,\nRebellious strife races like crocodiles.\nContending in clamor, trampling one another,\nHow can one attain the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui?\nFrozen like ice, wary as treading frost,\nBlazing like flames, startled by kindling.\nWho grasps the balance of fate’s subtle workings?\nI drift in tranquil detachment.\nWhen sincerity and the Dao penetrate the first beginning,\nHow can the subtle and distant be fathomed?",

guard the serene void.\n\nCold and heat alternate in ceaseless succession,\nPast and present ever shift and replace.\nVigorous movement turns without pause,\nRound and square settle high and low.\nRain and dew—what is not instruction?\nWind and thunder complete the work of creation.\nThe supreme principle governs the dark mechanism,\nShaping and nurturing with measured art.\n\nGreat indeed is the embodiment of sincerity and clarity,\nCultivating and refining to weave purity.\nTo establish destiny is to build the foundation,\nFollowing the model provides ample support.\nWhy let adornment stray from truth,\nOr flaws and blights lack tempering and forging?\nThe banks of the Qi lie silent, their echoes faint,\nThe profound workings drift in sorrowful grace.\n\nConfucius and Mozi walked distinct paths,\nMencius pursued a different noble labor.\nThrough perilous passes to Wei and Lu they ventured,\nYet who ultimately followed the kingly Way?\nChunyu’s will remained unbowed,\nGongsun Long claimed the firm and white.\nThe odes of Qi resounded with vigor,\nWhile Yang Xiong lamented the *Beautiful New*.\nLaozi’s dark words grew obscure,\nGuan Yin knew the pursuit of the mean.\nZhuangzi and Liezi stood as strange masters,\nThe *Pian Dao* school taught emptiness.\nTheir doctrines arose amid Zhou’s decline,\nYet how far could their wild defenses go?\nIf the times favor not the good,\nDetachment leads to nothingness.\n\nThe supreme Dao wondrously embraces the Three Ultimates,\nHuman culture reveals the imperial heart.\nBenevolence and righteousness are heaven’s nature,\nEndowment of essence—why confusion or delusion?\nTo master reverence is to achieve purity,\nIn conduct, guard the self with care.\nThe mean and harmony govern the balance,\nGeneration and growth reside in the spirit’s work.\nDrill and contemplate to grasp the thread,\nIn subtlety and peril, be steadfast and reverent.\nBeware the boastful and obsequious,\nWho miss the wind of Lian and Luo.\nIn secluded integrity, I hold distant longing,\nYet where shall the crooked and devious turn?\n\nJoy in the dwelling of fish and birds,\nHarmony in the following of springs and stones.\nThe vast tune of high antiquity,\nSilent and profound, returns to Fuxi and Nong.\nEmbracing truth, I awaken to suspended liberation,\nIn *equalizing things*, I probe my own mystery.\nThe crescent moon foretells the hidden depths,\nThe compass’s center aligns with the profound abyss.\nVacuity and clarity share the pivot,\nWondrous union intertwines in distant revolution.\nYang fire overflows the true season,\nYin ice melts the cold spring.\nThe yellow center turns the chariot’s track,\nA single breath completes the celestial cycle.\nJade liquid nurtures the spirit root,\nJasper radiance blooms in the field of mushrooms.\nDivine transformation defies verbal measure,\nIts signs vast as the dark expanse.\n\nLong have I tasted the secrets of the mysterious mandate,\nRiding the wind to summon the immortal Gu Quan.\nSupreme harmony lies in preserving union,\nGuiding the reins to soar on high.\nSitting in forgetfulness, the swallow rests at ease,\nWhile the shallow world entangles in frantic pursuit.\nIf one truly understands the principle of life,\nThe nature and destiny of things become utterly clear.\nNo need to wield the blade in idle play,\nThe sacrificial ox trusts the celestial whetstone.\nFortune and misfortune intertwine,\nExistence and decay must be self-evident.\nExcrescences are but clods of earth,\nHow can the fox’s eloquence be trusted?\nShen Gong turned back his chariot,\nYuan Gu pressed on to the end.\nChaoxu and Xu You shamed the pure stream,\nShu Shi was called a worthy minister.\nI sing the song of gathering lingzhi,\nNo longer ensnared by cherry or netting.\nTo leap forward as the lame turtle,\nHonor and disgrace—what cause for alarm?\nThose who steal names are base as Tian and Shi,\nWhat sorrow in their brewing and acceptance?\nThe beauty of a man lies in his birds and calves,\nThe jian bird is not in Cao’s peril.\nConfucius returned, lowing like a calf,\nDuke Yu departed in wonder.\nXi Fu was no mere reed,\nSai Shu’s *qilin* was in vain.\nTo sharpen oneself is to summon the distant wind,\nThrough a thousand ages, all return to the same beauty.\n\nAlas, Wei Zhuangzi,\nWhy sigh alone?\nGathering feng grass, I walk and sing,\nForever bound for the mountain forest’s retreat.\n\nHeaven and earth are but forms and vessels,\nYin and yang wield their gathering and chaos.\nThe myriad breaths surge in tangled motion,\nHandle and socket—how could they meet by chance?\nDregs and chaff sink in delusion,\nThe colt’s snatching—what equality is there?\nThe plain path values steadfast integrity,\nHolding the pattern, one sees the center’s design.\nQue and Jie relied on plowing’s bounty,\nLian and Huan kept their purity and grace.\nXian Zhang declined the fish-drawn carriage,\nChen Yu severed the sheep’s trail.\nThe inch-long worm transforms to blue and yellow,\nSlander and praise—beware the wooden duke.\nThe *Wei Feng* laments the *Cypress Boat*,\nThe river’s flow—how swiftly it passes.\nLin Lei stood silent,\nGathering orchids, he sang in the hidden thicket.\n\nThe morning sun rises on the eastern trees,\nThe faint moon drifts over the western peak.\nThe Milky Way’s rushing rapids draw near,\nThe flocking birds join in song.\nSpring and summer’s climates differ,\nCold and heat each follow their course.\nI long for distant companionship,\nThis man’s orchid lapel is fragrant.\nFar removed from the world’s dust,\nOnly the faint echo of jade’s music remains.\nWhy speak of lofty aspirations?\nMy feelings stir as I hand over my hairpin.\n\nThe numinous shade dims the sun’s brilliance,\nA pure breeze enters the bed’s curtains.\nThe swallows nest in their old eaves,\nThe shore’s geese take flight on high.\nThe courtyard trees flourish in southern glory,\nThe river’s flow hastens eastward.\nBramble and thorn choke the road,\nHesitating, where shall I go?\nAscend that lofty mound,\nWhere mugwort and artemisia spread in profusion.\nGo, go—speak no more,\nFor black dust easily soils the robe.\n\nThe distant eastern mountains stretch on,\nWinding northwest through orchid groves.\nWhere do I fasten my girdle’s jade?\nThe fierce wind blows the evening chill.\nFrozen mists congeal in the day’s cold,\nFrost and dew make the journey harder.\nI grieve for this fragrant essence,\nLest it be marred by weeds and decay.\nThe spring’s flow sobs in sorrow,\nThe dark cicada wails in the empty hills.\nThe hidden lingzhi—vainly I seek to pluck it,\nHow can I alone find peace?\n\nThe eastern mountain stands high and level,\nThe stream’s current runs deep and swift.\nSoaring birds take flight on high,\nFloating clouds gather in layered shade.\nSpring’s fragrance thrives in a hundred blossoms,\nA mournful wind sways the sunlit grove.\nFlourishing and withering—like morning and dusk,\nIn old age, I vainly lament.\nWhy scheme for wealth and rank?\nThe empty window shames a thousand gold.\nThe purple mushrooms of Shangshan bloom,\nYet what heart did Yuan and Qi truly hold?\n\nDriving the chariot from the western city,\nThe outskirts teem with fragrant trees.\nMisty drizzle dampens my timid robes,\nThick shade veils the courtyard gate.\nThe cold sun sinks into the long river,\nThe southern road stretches far.\nLong have I been parted from my home,\nStep by step, I turn to look back.\nWithin a hundred years of life,\nHow many times does fear and dread arise?\nThe bright moon shines on the lofty ridge,\nThe stars number but four or five.\nI gaze in melancholy—where to go?\nThe autumn wind’s song at dusk.\n\nWinter’s chill arrives,\nThe north wind blows through the poplar garden.\nFalling leaves cry the autumn’s voice,\nThe evening light shines on the western pavilion.\nI know not that the night is not yet spent,\nThe stars’ radiance gleams and multiplies.\nFeeding the horse, I cross the solid ice,\nThe traveler sighs at the road’s difficulty.\nI ponder my lifelong aspirations,\nHard to express in following footsteps.\nThe ice strings draw forth wondrous notes,\nTheir lingering echoes drift among the clouds.\nI lift my head in thought through the ages,\nThe flickering candle faces another year’s cold.\n\nIn the northeast stands a fine tree,\nAt dusk, the faint wind chills.",

      "translated_text": "The rains linger on the road for years,\nFloating mists still soar and scatter.\nThe evening sun descends the western ridge,\nIts lingering glow illumines the secluded chamber.\nWhite dew overflows the steps,\nThe Milky Way dips low, then rises high.\nI throw on my robe and rise to pace,\nWhy so much inward sorrow?\nI fear only that my aspirations will be thwarted,\nGrasping my hair—I see it swiftly turn gray.\n\n**Intending to Roam as an Immortal**\nNorth of the verdant mountains grow the magic mushrooms,\nOn the lofty ridge stand trees of splendor.\nTheir fragrant petals gleam morning and evening,\nBranches and leaves flourish on their own.\nI long to soar with feathered pendants through the heavens,\nTo transcend the world in lofty reclusion.\nI lift my traces beyond the azure stream,\nGaze afar at the oranges by the limpid pool.\nOnce, Master Fuqiu built his hut,\nForever chanting, he rode the light gale.\nWith towering vision, he spied the steep isles,\nSoaring and wheeling through the circling winds.\nFar-reaching, he roamed the six directions,\nScorning the arts of Xu You and Han Kang.\nSinging boldly, he followed the luminous tracks,\nSerene, he rested in the hidden depths.\nHearing the clamor of the profit-seeking world,\nI hide in the mountains, far from the crowd.\nWhy strive for a carriage and four?\nWhat need to return to my lotus hut?\nI climb the forest-clad ridges,\nGrasp the marsh grass and gaze over the clear stream.\nThe layered peaks invite lingering,\nHow could I again don the long robe of office?\nOn Mount Kongtong, the hidden pillar-scribe,\nIn the gardens of Zheng, one leaps in reclusion.\nWhen understanding dawns, the great bird takes flight,\nWhen transcendent power surges, the deep fish soars.\nDwelling unseen beyond mist and clouds,\nI chant aloud, gazing toward the primal beginning.\nA numinous peak towers ten thousand fathoms high,\nWithin it dwells a student of immortality.\nMist congeals on the cliffs and valleys,\nClouds veil the springs and dust.\nWho can fathom what manner of man he is?\nI hear he is Ge Hong.\nHe lifts his traces toward Luofu,\nThe elixir of immortality grants long vision.\nHis chariot and canopy turn northward,\nIn the forest of pearls, he awaits the phoenix’s tread.\nThe Jade Maiden has departed—shall I follow?\nCold and light, I spread my wings.\nQu Yuan’s lament finds no path,\nWhy gaze ahead, awaiting what?\n\n**Intending to Summon the Recluse**\nI pace the layered heights, grasping the handle of reclusion,\nTreading the secluded path through winding turns.\nThe forest’s shelter is no mere construction,\nThorns and brambles fill the desolate corner.\nOrchids grace the lofty marsh,\nTheir lingering fragrance veils the encircling home.\nDistant peaks stand jagged and steep,\nTowering trees rise in solemn majesty.\nHere, one relies on plowing and herding,\nThe fields and acres already store their harvest.\nWhy then be bound by worldly ties?\nThe steep valleys are my joy.\nIn Shangluo, I secretly tend my garden,\nOn the high mound, I rest with Chang Ju.\nWhy linger in hesitation?\nTruly, I long to sing with Jie Yu.\nI recline in the heart of the forest,\nAs the last rays of the setting sun spread their glory below.\nBelow lies a winding clear pool,\nEnough to wash the dust from my cap-strings.\nAmid the deep green and dense growth,\nPines and cassia stand firm and steadfast.\nThickets and thickets of mugwort and wormwood,\nCold springs gleam in solitary clarity.\nFew can wear both sash and virtue,\nYet retreat and solitude may be embraced alone.\nCarrying my basket, I tread the wild path,\nLike Chao Fu and Xu You, free from entanglements.\nThe perfected one does not climb the former slope,\nThe great transformation rides this course.\nI gaze in melancholy—with whom shall I find accord?\nHesitant, I clasp my lingering fragrance.\nMy long-held admiration finds no match,\nPacing the courtyard, I stand in vain.\nWhom shall I follow in my wandering?\nThat man sleeps among the reeds.\nAt dawn, I climb the western ridge,\nAt dusk, I return to the eastern marsh.\nThe lofty ridge stands like a towering screen,\nLush trees flourish in dense array.\nI yearn for Yue, sighing at the wind in the bamboo,\nLonging for Yang, lamenting the dew-laden blossoms.\nWhy do the trees of the forest stand in vain?\nFloating clouds veil the layered peaks.\nEmpty nests cling to slender branches,\nThe numinous shade shelters the secluded dwelling.\nMy clumsiness needs no waiting,\nI long only to rest in the vaulted canopy.\nShunning profit, my feet stand firm,\nWhere shall I raise my sleeves and settle?\n\n**Intending to Present My Form to My Shadow**\nAll things share a single root,\nFullness and emptiness are their constant.\nHeaven and earth are also forms and vessels,\nTheir flowing movement relies on soft and hard.\nVigorous and yielding ever unceasing,\nWhy grieve within the Great Harmony?\nThis floating life is but an illusion,\nYet the numinous light reveals good and ill.\nSuccess and failure are but fleeting shadows,\nAspirations thwarted, hard to align.\nChasing and racing in defilement,\nDrowning brings calamity upon oneself.\nLet your inner light shine, steadfast and bright,\nTrue virtue knows no bounds.\nAt dusk, be vigilant in your steps,\nStraying brings frost and ice.\nI wish to gird myself with these words,\nHoping thereby to strengthen myself.\n\n**Intending My Shadow to Answer My Form**\nOur traces are both like morning dew,\nWalking this form, we prize likeness.\nHeaven and earth are a vast loom,\nYin and yang—how can we fathom their workings?\nThe ten thousand beings weave in profusion,\nChasing and racing in clamor and glare.\nDarkness daily deepens the obscurity,\nSinking and drowning in filth.\nAbandoning purity for stench and impurity,\nHow can we return to the bright illumination?\nAh, the sagely and wise,\nTheir admonitions are vast and essential.\nTreading the furrowed path is like walking on ice,\nReverent care alone brings flourishing.\nBe sincere in cultivating yourself,\nLest you fall into the scorn of a hundred years.\nThe great transformation shares a single return,\nIn clarity and emptiness, behold the wondrous.\n\n**Intending an Ancient Theme**\nTo nurture the heart is to see Heaven’s principle,\nMovement and stillness cycle without end.\nRightness and destiny are fundamentally one,\nThe celestial endowment is deeply hidden.\nThe august words of the sages,\nI take to heart with my very lungs and liver.\nTo fulfill one’s nature is to hold fast,\nTo preserve it is no arduous task.\nThe subtle and minute lie in focusing the One,\nAbiding in reverence turns back the rushing torrent.\nSwift birds must curb desire,\nHeat and cold arise from agitation and stillness.\nHeaven’s vigor should be unceasing,\nThe mechanism of transformation moves in cycles.\nSincerity in oneself establishes the ultimate,\nReturning to unity is no hard thing.\nAlas, those who draw distinctions,\nSighing at the darkness beyond their ken.\nThey grasp the moon like the historian of Jin,\nOr shrink like the cicada of Qin and Zhao.\nIn silence, I renounce the vain pursuit,\nMy indignation and pacing deepen my sighs.\nHow could the great and noble,\nFrom ancient times, harbor such sorrow?\nI look up, yearning for the ancients,\nTo fathom the divine is the grand vision.\n\n**Miscellaneous Poems**\nMorning shadows gather the sun’s radiance,\nWind and rain come from the northern grove.\nThe seasons shift, the creatures change,\nThe rows of trees deepen their shade.\nI recline in the quiet of the courtyard,\nThe garden birds pour forth their sweet songs.\nI look up, cherishing the ancients,\nSitting cross-legged, embracing emptiness.\nI admire Yuan Xian’s lofty path,\nWhile Zigong laments poverty’s encroachment.\nIn the numinous realm, I rest in tranquil illumination,\nHiding my depths, I take up the task myself.\nLofty feelings align with reclusive ideals,\nMy solitary sighs scatter my serene heart.\nDragging my sandals, I sing of *Shu Li*,\nMy distant traces remain among rivers and peaks.\nThe dawn stars gleam with lingering light,\nThe full sun beautifies the graceful trees.\nUntil daybreak, the shadows hum softly,\nClear frost weighs on the clustered chrysanthemums.\nBy the shore, wild geese call in flight,\nReeds on the islet veil their lush green.\nThe beauty lies beyond the autumn waters,\nHer graceful traces beyond the steep valley.\nThe ways of kings and hegemons fade into antiquity,\nLike Yuan An’s noble and fragrant steps.\nAs the year wanes, I long to follow,\nI prepare my carriage, lingering in hesitation.\nWinding through the morning sun’s glow,\nSuddenly, I am deep in the forest’s curve.\nDawn and dusk bring shifting weather,\nThe garden and grove scatter their lingering cool.",
      "overlap_context": "I know not that the night is not yet spent,\nThe stars’ radiance gleams and multiplies.\nFeeding the horse, I cross the solid ice,\nThe traveler sighs at the road’s difficulty.\nI ponder my lifelong aspirations,\nHard to express in following footsteps.\nThe ice strings draw forth wondrous notes,\nTheir lingering echoes drift among the clouds.\nI lift my head in thought through the ages,\nThe flickering candle faces another year’s cold.\n\nIn the northeast stands a fine tree,\nAt dusk, the faint wind chills.",

      "translated_text": "Falling blossoms drift in the fading light,\nAs dusk approaches, dragonflies hum low.\nEarly summer’s heat has not yet burned,\nFragrant grasses intertwine by the pool’s edge.\n\nWeary, I rest beneath the pale moon’s glow,\nWhile frozen gusts brim with white dew.\nI linger in admiration of Zhou Xie,\nAnd lie in repose, cherishing Guan Ning’s ways.\n\nLofty vision grieves the illusory flux,\nYet concealment or display rests in man’s greatness.\nMy heart delights in the call of springs and stones,\nDiscarding sandals, I sever all floating entanglements.\n\nIn early summer, chilling winds still blow,\nScorching heat has not yet come full circle.\nFragrant trees spread their leaves like clouds,\nMorning birds clamor, seeking one another.\n\nHidden blossoms adorn thickets and groves,\nPathside grasses grow soft and lush.\nAs the sun sets, I rejoice in finding refuge,\nWhere thorns and brambles veil the lofty hills.\n\nLife passes swift as a galloping steed,\nAll attachments are but fleeting shadows.\nFeeding taro to delude the troop of monkeys,\nI cast off the body—what fault is there?\n\nPursuing the Dao is like brewing wine in a gourd,\nWhy should I harbor cares for a hundred generations?\nBorn with no intent to engage the world,\nThe ways of the vulgar are not mine to know.\n\nThis body, illusory as morning dew,\nYet joy unfolds with each dawn’s light.\nBeholding heaven and earth in their vastness,\nI see all as a single swirl of gathering and scattering.\n\nEmbracing poverty, I sense wealth’s toil,\nHolding to lowliness, I forget rank’s peril.\nBan Biao cherished antiquity,\nZhou Dang’s integrity was rare and strange.\n\nDiscarding strife, I shed sharp contention,\nFortune and misfortune are not mine to bequeath.\nIf the world lacks men like Qian Lou,\nTo whom shall I speak these words?\n\nIn bitter winter, motion never ceases,\nThe four wilds lie beneath layered gloom.\nAt dusk, floating clouds race,\nSorrowful winds stir the sparse woods.\n\nPerched birds call from familiar branches,\nYearning for spring, I utter a hidden chant.\nMy carriage, greased, stumbles on past tracks,\nMy wings, once spread, now seldom sound in flight.\n\nFar off, I entrust myself to the secret summons of the profound,\nRoaming freely, I renounce the dusty hairpin.\nLight and shadow dart like lightning,\nHow can I ever align with the bamboo’s steadfast heart?\n\nGazing afar, I rest upon the sunlit ridge,\nA lone soaring bird vanishes beyond the towering peaks.\nBeholding the boundless transformations of the myriad things,\nWho could suffice to anchor my heart?\n\nSuddenly, the morning air softens,\nClear and bright, unobscured by haze.\nMy gaze flows beyond the eight horizons,\nNurturing the sprouts of all creation.\n\nSweet rain murmurs at the eaves,\nSpring’s warmth suffuses all with gentle radiance.\nMorning winds stir the lofty groves,\nThe vast river flows on, boundless.\n\nI recline among my books,\nEmptying my mind to follow the ancients’ intent.\nThe dust’s fetters still my swift flight,\nPassions’ grime cools its burning heat.\n\nWhy seek Pang Meng’s summons,\nOr pledge myself to Xue Fang’s pact?\nI lament those who chase after trivial ends,\nAs the vast heavens reveal the Emperor of Images.\n\n---\n\n**Autumn Meditations**\n\nFierce winds roar through the towering trees,\nI stand dismayed, knowing autumn has come.\nMorning light transforms valleys and streams,\nDay and night, clouds drift across the sky.\n\nProlonged rains dissolve the scorching season,\nDense shade hastens the cicadas’ urgent cries.\nI linger, moved by the passing of time,\nParting my robe, I cling to solitude.\n\nFleeting lives are like gnats and mosquitoes,\nTheir breaths and chirps all alike.\nI sigh with Yin Xi’s lament,\nAnd long for Hong Yao’s companionship.\n\nWandering, I entrust myself to the central grove,\nYet where are the steadfast and few?\nGreed and strife vie for hooks and bait,\nHow can one ever be free?\n\nThe dark sage wished to remain silent,\nWho will understand my sorrow?\nBitter rains swell the cold pools,\nThe sorrowful terrace wails through the night.\n\nMournful crickets echo through courtyard and door,\nWild islets lie beneath drifting mist.\nGrasses and trees grow ever more sere,\nStriking my breast, a thousand cares arise.\n\nThe bright lamp stirs the bed and zither,\nYet tuning their notes yields no true sound.\nFar distant are the transformations of the Yellow Emperor’s age,\nWhile petty men’s resentments swell within.\n\nGloom spreads its excesses,\nThe altar of Kan rises and falls with dawn and dusk.\nThrough the night, I lie awake, restless,\nVainly nursing regrets and remorse.\n\nSince ancient times, sinking and rising have been our lot,\nExhausted, how can we journey far?\nGazing broadly, all is but a fleeting instant,\nFor now, I release my lingering emotions.\n\nGlowing clouds gather at dusk,\nAutumn’s air grows ever more desolate.\nFrost and dew turn increasingly bitter,\nCrickets sing through the cold night.\n\nMorning mist veils the vaulted woods,\nSoaring birds rest in hidden marshes.\nMy bearing, once graceful, now frail,\nI am moved to sorrow and lament.\n\nThe vulgar vie to be caught in nets,\nFew follow the ancient ways’ guiding line.\nDark vapors shroud the crossroads,\nThe restless trample through brambles and thickets.\n\nSong Yu lamented the sorrowful wind,\nThe divine ruler gazed up to the steadfast model.\nI feast on clouded wine and fallen blossoms,\nAnd aspire to surpassing virtue, driving my chariot beyond.\n\nNine cups steeped with orchid’s fragrance,\nThe withering groves’ chrysanthemums turn pale.\nFor now, I follow the path of tranquil ease,\nWho can bear the world’s reproach?\n\nThe crimson sun purifies its scorching might,\nThe autumn season shifts to metal’s purity.\nMorning groves stir with swift winds,\nCourtyard grasses brim with white dew.\n\nFalling leaves drift in the faint sunlight,\nGrasshoppers sing near the door.\nWaves flow across the level river,\nI see mandarin ducks calling by the shore.\n\nIn seclusion, I speak of late autumn,\nThe seasons’ sequence—when will it pause?\nA thousand ancient thoughts weigh upon the eaves,\nLofty aspirations stretch far into the distance.\n\nVainly, I feel the sorrow of Hui Lian,\nHow could I yearn for An Ren’s admiration?\nI turn the reins toward the swan’s high carriage,\nAnd cast my cap into the river’s flow.\n\nDelighting in the joys of hills and gardens,\nI gaze up and down, relying on hidden contemplation.\nDismayed by the woodcutter’s fading traces,\nI sing a vast song upon the desert road.\n\nEmbracing my clumsiness, I find harmony beyond the groves,\nNurturing my spirit, all cares dissolve.\nDense gloom veils the solemn and fierce,\nThe Han’s floods swell through the lofty morning.\n\nFine trees contend in the flying wind,\nHidden orchids grow long and fragrant.\nLiving in solitude, I trust in emptiness and tranquility,\nThe central valley—how desolate it is!\n\nGuo Tai has already donned his cap and carriage mat,\nFei Yi should keep his wheels far away.\nDust-laden winds blaze with cunning,\nStirring unease in my troubled heart.\n\nWithout the refuge of hills and valleys,\nHow could I escape the clamor?\nResting as the cold and heat dictate,\nI compose my flesh to endure the dawn’s chill.\n\nA cold spring suffices to purify itself,\nOne cleansing, and my spirit soars.\nI give free rein to my feelings, singing of the valley’s wind,\nAnd urge my steps toward Fuxi and Shennong’s call.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Su Su’an’s \"Occasional Thoughts\"**\n\nForm and substance are both illusory,\nYet yang’s strength alone remains steadfast and true.\nHeaven and earth embody firmness and compliance,\nThe supreme principle fills the center, vast and profound.\n\nLong have I wandered mountains and marshes,\nAs spring deepens, the fragrant grasses grow.\nEndlessly, I cherish old friends,\nThrough a thousand ages, we share this same Dao.\n\nI cast off my traces, leaving the world’s entanglements,\nAnd long in words for the cave-dwelling sage.\nPushing through brambles, I dwell in seclusion,\nThe Dao is present—who can deny me?\n\nThe mountain valley’s joys are boundless,\nI lie in repose within the central grove.\nDwelling in silence, I guard the deep abyss,\nFor a thousand years, only this inch of heart remains.\n\n---\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Su Su’an’s Miscellaneous Poems**\n\nProlonged rains darken the lingering spring,\nHidden birds sing in the fragrant trees.\nFalling blossoms drift on the evening wind,\nCold streams are wholly bound and gone.\n\nThe seasons pass like rushing rapids,\nFloating entanglements vanish like racing ducks.\nIn clarity, I behold the myriad transformations,\nForm and color ever renew and return.\n\nStillness and rest foster inner strength,\nHolding fast from dawn to dusk.\nFollowing the ancients, I wish to remain silent,\nCutting the sprouts to leave room for growth.\n\nThe steadfast trunk endures the winter’s cold,\nPines and cypresses—how could they wither and

      "translated_text": "**Five-Character Ancient Poems by Celestial Master Zhang Yuchu of Mount Qi, the Master of Non-Action**\n\n**Inscribed on the Pavilion of Purity and Whiteness**\nGeomancy moves the primal transformation,\nAll existence prepares its steadfast unity.\nThe supreme principle holds wondrous mechanism,\nIn clarity and emptiness, its radiance knows no end.\nHolding fast to the center, one’s nature is bright and good,\nYet turbid obstructions vie to entangle and exceed.\nThe noble lord knows the essence of benevolence,\nUpholding the root, he values conduct and restraint.\nMaps and histories fill the chamber’s corners,\nWindows and doors open to the forest’s heart.\nVermilion and whitewash exalt the structure’s brightness,\nFragrant vines and blossoms flourish in lush array.\nI join the company of venerable worthies,\nDiscoursing and delving deep with each unfolding scroll.\nImperial kin and trusted vassals of the realm,\nThey hold fast to loyalty, aiding peace and tranquility.\nAutumn frost deepens the pool’s purity,\nThe cold moon gleams, the river flows in ease.\nGazing afar, I see the dust-bound multitude,\nTheir fleeting glory like dusk’s dimming light.\nThe roc soars beyond the celestial pond,\nIts wings unfurled, no turning back.\nCaps and sashes display worldly merit,\nYet lofty renown is revered through the ages.\nMay the ancestral altars stand in enduring splendor,\nFor a thousand generations, their prosperity secure.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Studio of Silent Learning**\nThe Great Change foreshadows the embryo’s glow,\nYin and Yang revolve without beginning.\nThe empty and numinous, wondrous and unfathomable,\nIn movement and stillness, the supreme principle is complete.\nAll things share a single origin,\nYet their divisions rarely show clear bounds.\nHuman culture emerged with Fuxi’s trigrams,\nSages and worthies set the standard and the path.\nThe sacred learning takes stillness as its core,\nThe outer dragon then stirs in hidden awakening.\nHeaven and man seldom unite as one,\nPrinciple and desire contend in tangled strife.\nOutwardly drowned, one hastens in reckless pursuit,\nInwardly swayed, like an arrow loosed in haste.\nThe limpid abyss is muddied and submerged,\nThe warp and weft of the loom grow tangled and loose.\nTo return is like turning the chariot’s shaft,\nSwift as startled flight, then suddenly at ease.\nIf the heart’s inch is bright and settled,\nIt gleams like autumn’s frost on the river’s waters.\nIn Yangzhou, a scion of old,\nWarm and steadfast, he follows the ancient way.\nStudying profit, he examines the source of transformation,\nDelving into the numinous pivot, he fathoms the profound.\nHis poetry aspires to the craft of Bao and Xie,\nHis conduct emulates Guan and Min’s footsteps.\nNurturing his virtue in times of harmony,\nHis merit shines forth in glorious display.\nSurveying the vulgar currents of the age,\nTheir perversity knows no end.\nDiligence and seeking must never cease,\nHolding reverence to find rest and peace.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Studio of Self-Examination**\nThe empty and numinous governs the five senses,\nThe four limbs are bounded by balanced qi.\nThe supreme principle resides in the heart’s inch,\nHeaven and man thus unite as one.\nFlattery and vacillation stir the passions,\nWorldly desires spread their mutual veils.\nWaywardness gives rise to hidden faults,\nPeril and danger arise from within.\nCongealed depths are dimmed by drowning,\nScorching fires rage in ceaseless blaze.\nThe canons and counsels of sages and worthies,\nFrom the Luo and Min streams, open hidden truths.\nReturning is not a distant path,\nTurning inward, like casting away the trivial.\nConduct rests in holding reverence,\nThe swift steed is stilled by six reins.\nIn movement and stillness, timing is key,\nVigilance and caution need no deliberate thought.\nBy the Xiang River dwells a brilliant scholar,\nLong versed in the secrets of Qi and Huang.\nIn learning, he scorns the mediocre,\nA Confucian of old, his lofty aspirations firm.\nThrough silent cultivation, he attains flourishing success,\nInward reflection, he fears only complacency.\nAt dusk, he trembles as if treading thin ice,\nHis radiant virtue then burgeons and thrives.\nDiligently refining his nurturing of virtue,\nEach day he advances, never resting.\nTo embody benevolence is to bestow it widely,\nHow could retribution be far or delayed?\nThe marvels of stillness and response are unfathomable,\nYet the corrupt vie in madness and rebellion.\nI wish to admonish the shallow and base,\nThat bright teachings may rouse their resolve.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Studio of Continuing the Aspiration**\nHeaven and Earth revolve without cease,\nThis Dao is contained in the Six Classics.\nThe noble man continues his forebears’ aspirations,\nExpansively observing their fulfillment.\nThe cosmos nurtures essence and vitality,\nThe earth draws upon the rivers and mountains’ spirit.\nIn Yingchuan, a distinguished lineage of letters,\nFor generations, they have worn the cap and sash.\nIn the forest of words, they stride with lofty steps,\nIn the realm of sages, their glorious name resounds.\nLiterary grace and integrity uphold the family’s teachings,\nThrough hardship, they rejoice in their worthy heir.\nHidden and withdrawn, he soars on outspread wings,\nHis refined reputation ascends the royal court.\nAs a worthy screen, his virtuous conduct shines,\nHis conferred words encompass wise and kind intent.\nLord Wang raises the inscribed plaque,\nHis profound virtue is loyal and true.\nThrough tempering and learning, he relies on clarity,\nImmersed and nurtured, his inner depths grow limpid.\nAccumulated within, it unfolds in wondrous essence,\nHis splendid verses bloom like jade and crystal.\nGazing upward, he honors his ancestors’ glory,\nHis noble writings will transmit his illustrious name.\nThe worthies of old inscribed their words in metal and stone,\nFor a thousand years, their sincerity remains bright.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Painting of Yellow Thatched Hut**\nThe earth’s embrace founds the high and profound,\nAll transformations arise from the dark and vast.\nThe wondrous Dao harbors perfect harmony,\nYin and Yang enfold their boundless expanse.\nFamed mountains cradle the central pivot,\nTheir distant gaze towers above seas and peaks.\nA single qi revolves within the compass,\nThe Three Flowers gestate in the sacred enclosure.\nOutwardly, they command the spirits’ service,\nInwardly, they grasp the wind and thunder’s might.\nWith yellow thatch, the humble hut is thatched,\nA lone figure treads the cinnabar ravine.\nLong ago, he aided the drought-stricken,\nAs the river surged with leaping whales.\nJade blossoms hide the cavern’s heights,\nHis successors rise in surpassing splendor.\nHis glorious renown enhances the divine land,\nHis dark robes adorn the stalwart horn.\nGazing again at the painting of Master Hu,\nHis brushwork embodies purity and simplicity.\nIn profound silence, no sound is heard,\nThe soaring terrace joins the vast and empty.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Painting of Frost Seclusion in the Southern Mountains**\nThe supreme Dao lies distant amid brambles and barriers,\nRelaxation and tension require foresight.\nThe Jade River inspires distant longing,\nQuietly nestled in the forest and pond’s seclusion.\nClouds and woods are drenched in nourishing rain,\nWind and springs resound from the lofty hills.\nHis dark countenance shines like the patterned leopard,\nHis hidden traces grace the southern wilds.\nIn tranquility, he finds the heron’s delight,\nThe faint and distant Jiang and Han flow on.\nAt ease here, he relies on fertile abundance,\nHow could he be lost in schemes and plans?\nYi and Lü were not matched by their age,\nYet their hidden virtue was ultimately sought.\nMaster Zhuang excelled in avoiding harm,\nHis flourishing presence observed in secluded cultivation.\n\n---\n\n**On Climbing Woodcutter’s Slope on the Ninth Day, for Self-Amusement**\nThe morning sun dispels the lingering shade,\nAt dawn’s first light, I step into the secluded valley.\nHills and gardens offer distant refuge,\nThe world’s net—how confining it seems!\nA thousand peaks rise like jade mountains,\nA lone spring gurgles, rinsing chiming jade.\nThe crossbeam gate leans on the lofty hill,\nThe empty window faces the rippling bamboo.\nThe seasons respond to the swift-flowing stream,\nA toilsome life is truly like a tethered colt.\nThe noble man is cautious in action and retreat,\nWhat are gain and loss to honor and disgrace?\nPraising cunning courts perilous schemes,\nSincerity and trust shame the crooked hook.\nHolding fast to the center, I guard fate and righteousness,\nIn simple contentment, I find ample sufficiency.\nLonging for the recluses of Mounts Ji and Ying,\nWith gourds cast aside, what more could I desire?\nI remove my sandals to caress the towering pine,\nPouring rich wine, I face the clustered chrysanthemums.\nAutumn flowers display their evening splendor,\nFor a while, they please the heart and eye.\nI let out a long whistle into the empty vastness,\nIn enlightened vision, I scorn the vulgar crowd.\nProudly gazing toward the Milky Way’s promise,\nHow could I have leisure to chase the deer?\nDwelling in emptiness, I find nothing precious,\nIn yielding compliance, I wander without haste.\n\n---\n\n**On Farming**\nPlowing side by side in the southern field,\nOur crops and plants grow daily more lush.\nSowing and planting, each in its season,\nSome we know well, others are new.\nThe plains and woods hold rich soil,\nThe springs and valleys invite exploration of their depths.\nWeeding and hoeing already feel laborious,\nSpinning and weaving fill the nights and days.",

      "translated_text": "**On Farming (continued)**\n\nThe plow and hoe echo the teachings of Zheng and Yi,\nThe First Farmer is revered as the Zhou sovereign’s heir.\nMy plain heart rarely mingles with worldly dust,\nMy secluded path clings to cliffs and peaks.\nI shoulder my burden and read my books—\nWhat fault lies in this for the world?\nPoverty and lowliness bring their own joy,\nAs Zhuangzi’s boundless tolerance would allow.\nI return late from the market,\nYet rise early when dwelling in the mountains.\nWind and frost turn autumn to winter—\nCan prosperity or decline last forever?\nFallen leaves still the cold branches,\nThe harvest rests on thick straw.\nEven sages tilled the soil themselves—\nHow could this not align with the royal Dao?\nLike Pang and Ge, who met in humble times,\nFortune and misfortune are not ours to keep.\nI sigh for the ancients in their words,\nReflecting on myself, my hidden cares deepen.\nWeary and clumsy, I shame the steadfast Ju,\nLike the farmer who loathed the creeping weeds.\nI bow in apology to the farmers and gardeners,\nCautioning them to clear the brambles with care.\n\n**On Gathering Firewood**\n\nLong have I yearned for the mountains and marshes’ call,\nHere I find joy in simplicity and contentment.\nFortunate to escape the snares of the world,\nI wander freely, untroubled by solitude.\nReturning, I trace the wild paths,\nThe forest’s shelter as fine as Dun and Gen.\nMy humble gate is veiled in green vines,\nThe square pond cradles clear ripples.\nTowering pines rise like blue peaks,\nFlying springs cascade into jade pools.\nAt dusk, I hear the woodcutters’ songs—\nTheir distant words stir thoughts on life’s true nature.\nI rest in integrity, forsaking clumsiness,\nFor what gain lies in reckless haste?\nI ponder the ancients’ forgotten sayings,\nEntrusting my livelihood to hoe and basket.\nLike fish and birds, I fear the snares,\nNot the stench of salted depths.\nIn nurturing my clumsiness, I know imperfect wholeness,\nHolding fullness, I guard against overflow.\nEmbracing the Dao, I grasp the primal mechanism,\nWhile the lost trust in fate’s scales.\nWhy lament Yuan Xian’s poverty?\nAlone, I fathom the cycles of fortune and hardship.\nGazing up and down, my heart’s resolve wavers,\nTime slips by in fleeting moments.\nI wash my feet, casting off my tassels,\nSinging wildly to cleanse my hidden frustrations.\n\n**Night Sitting in a Mountain Dwelling: Recording My Thoughts**\n\nSecluded and obscure, far from worldly schemes,\nIn quiet solitude, I find true delight.\nAt dawn, I summon the carefree to join me,\nTheir distant steps slow with plain staffs.\nWe empty the spring wine to the last drop,\nThe garden’s greens grow in abundance.\nAnxious yet glad, they stay the night,\nThe window hums with wind and spring.\nDew on the grass stirs the evening insects,\nStars in the woods gleam through the open sky.\nThe fragrant pool reflects the new moon,\nMountain air clings to the fertile earth.\nIn stillness, I harmonize with ease,\nMy slow pace content with nurturing.\nLike the cicada shedding its filth,\nI drift in emptiness, free from ailment.\nLong have I strayed from Shang and Hao’s paths,\nWhen may I dream of Zhuangzi’s garden?\nThe firewood burns through the long night,\nFor a while, I bid the world’s burdens farewell.\n\n**Returning to My Mountain Dwelling in Late Summer of the Yihai Year: A Spontaneous Verse**\n\nLate summer’s lingering heat blazes,\nYet my secluded hopes align with my plain heart.\nFields and plains are veiled in lush green,\nStreams and islets gleam with dark clarity.\nThe farmhouse rests in quiet, its chickens and dogs at peace,\nThe overgrown path embraces the deep woods.\nThe round pool reveals its sacred structure,\nLayered peaks unfold in towering array.\nLotus vapors brush the morning dew,\nFish waves ripple beneath the dense shade.\nI cast off my cares and find tranquility,\nWashing my heart clean in the mountain stream.\nNot from pride do I leave the world behind,\nBut to nurture truth, I must rely on myself.\nThe autumn wind stirs early longing—\nI pour my heart into the zither of the hills.\n\n**Inscription on a Painting of a Secluded Mountain Dwelling**\n\nMy plain calling finds its finest in seclusion,\nMy youthful travels taught me to return early.\nI read not for official rank,\nBut wander the hills with staff in hand.\nI chose this wild land to build my home,\nWhere woods and waters stretch in ease.\nA stone bridge spans the empty ravine,\nEvening mists nourish the lofty peaks.\nDelighting in plowing and fishing,\nI decline all offers, content in retreat.\nOld friendships have long faded,\nMy talents seek no external use.\nThe painting captures this beauty,\nIts lofty spirit flowing in quiet streams.\nGazing at my dull and stubborn self,\nI leave my form among these hills and vales.\nUnrolling the scroll, I awaken to its goodness—\nFrom now on, I await the years’ endurance.\n\n**Evening Thoughts in a Mountain Dwelling**\n\nA lone pine stands in the twilight valley,\nAutumn thoughts fill the hills.\nHere, among pines and cassia, I find my place,\nWeary wings know when to return.\nThe autumn wind grows sharp and cold,\nThe pond’s ripples chime like jade rings.\nFallen leaves adorn the sunny ridge,\nThe thorn gate is draped in meadow orchids.\nI rise to open the window, setting my scattered thoughts in order,\nDistant chimes fade into the evening air.\nEvening dew dampens the clustered chrysanthemums,\nI crouch, my joy diminished.\nTroubles and blessings, faults and fortunes pass—\nIn obscurity, there is no blame or hardship.\nVirtue shines brightest in harmony,\nTurning inward, I find inner peace.\nUnderstanding heaven, I have long grasped fate,\nFinding joy where I rest, content in my place.\nThe great transformation is but a bubble’s pivot,\nThe cosmos vast as a floating gourd.\nClear frost settles on the thickets,\nTime slips by in an instant.\nThe cicada’s wings do not cling to the clouds—\nWhy sigh over delayed admiration?\nMy remaining years I entrust to stillness,\nMy outer cares lost in hidden depths.\n\n**Winter in a Mountain Dwelling**\n\nI follow my plain calling with steadfast resolve,\nMy lofty spirit unconfined by the world’s cage.\nA trickling stream echoes on the distant path,\nI lean on my staff and return to the secluded valley.\nWild sparrows chirp at the daytime door,\nThe square pond brims with cold green.\nSwift winds scatter the clear air,\nFrosted leaves glide through the forest’s curves.\nI touch my heart, my resolve shaken,\nMy feelings bound by the world’s net.\nYet my humble gate offers enough for rest—\nWhy should I envy the crane or the woodpecker’s perch?\nLong have I relied on Sun Deng’s wisdom,\nWhy trouble Ji Zhu with divination?\nI entrust my remaining years to nurturing truth,\nWho can sway my desires with fate’s decree?\nMy lineage is bound to heaven’s order,\nYet I grieve for the lost, stumbling in sorrow.\nIn earnestness, I shame my shortcomings,\nIn cultivating virtue, I ponder emptiness.\nWith clear vision, I yield to the flowing stream,\nDiscarding worldly burdens and needless haste.\nWhat I mourn is my unfulfilled longing,\nIts echoes lost in the distant hubbub.\nThick mists veil the distant peaks,\nThe clear sky gleams with frost and moon.\nCold streams chime like jade pendants,\nDew falls as the stars align.\nThe high pavilion congeals in mist,\nA biting wind cuts through the cold.\nTurning inward, I stand firm in fate,\nDwelling in patience, my resolve unwavering.\nThe yellow bird rests in the hill’s corner,\nIts haste and stumbles born of worldly dust.\nIn vain, the eloquent wander the empty valleys,\nTheir dark mysteries long cherished.\nHow could I blindly follow the vulgar chase,\nWhere gain and loss break the steadfast spirit?\nThe enlightened find joy in heaven’s will—\nWhat need have they to witness the vast emptiness?\nIn perfect harmony, the primal oneness is revealed,\nWashing away my hidden frustrations.\nFor now, I delight in the plum and bamboo’s fragrance,\nAs the year ends beyond the ice and snow.\nBasking in the warmth of the southern eaves,\nThe morning sun warms my humble home.\nDripping dew chimes in the clustered bamboo,\nIce creeps through the forest streams.\nThe winter plum blooms amid the snow,\nThe grasses bend with the wind.\nThe four seasons turn in their cycles,\nThe new sun dawns in the boundless sky.\nLayered peaks are veiled in thin mist,\nThe murmuring stream soothes my ears.\nReclining in the clouds and waters’ quiet,\nIn clarity and emptiness, I find my rest.\nWho in this world is not bound to fate?\nTo fulfill one’s nature lies within oneself.\nI lament past faults, yet embrace obscurity,\nChastening my beginnings to walk with care.\nHow could I fathom the workings of the primal mechanism?\nI follow the ancient path, looking to those who came before.\nRaising my head, I sigh to the azure heavens—\nTo whom could I speak of gathering herbs?\nMy dull and stubborn nature,\nI leave behind in these hills and vales.",

      "translated_text": "**A Small Drink in the Mountains, Presented to the Two Recluses Wang and Ji**\n\nThe first sun warms the dawn after rain,\nIn quiet delight, we meet by chance.\nThe humble cottage basks in morning light,\nForest and stream abound in clarity and space.\n\nBy chance we prolong the joy of clouds and waters,\nWho would call this gourd-dwelling narrow?\nLong have I cast off the dusty world’s passions,\nBirds and fish now greet me with ease.\n\nEmptiness and tranquility move with the Dao,\nDetachment only deepens heaven’s freedom.\nI see clearly how phoenix and roc pursue their paths,\nWhile others drown in the dusty net of day and night.\n\nI sigh in admiration for Zheng and Li’s summons—\nHow could I be swept away by drifting waves?\nAshamed of my dull and waning faculties,\nI retreat in stillness to the brambles and wilds.\n\nWhat fortune to join such venerable elders,\nOur bold songs stirring the crisp autumn air.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Rain**\n\nFine rain gathers on the lofty hills,\nI turn homeward to the white-clouded peaks.\nEntangled in worldly cares, my thoughts drift,\nYet in the heart of the forest, I find contentment.\n\nWater and trees lend their quiet ease,\nThe fragrance of spring deepens my intent.\nLeaping fish dance in round bubbles,\nJoyful birds sing in the shaded groves.\n\nNear the ravine, the stream begins to swell,\nFalling blossoms encroach on the overgrown path.\nAshamed I lack foresight,\nMy heart remains empty, my thoughts serene.\n\nHeaven’s Dao moves in silence,\nSincerity alone resides in the plain heart.\nVigilant cultivation brooks no delay—\nWho else shall bear this resolve?\n\n---\n\n**Water Pavilion, Dispelling Care**\n\nA chance meeting lifts distant aspirations,\nIn seclusion, no worldly ties entangle.\nThe square pond opens to quiet chambers,\nWater and trees hold lingering clarity.\n\nEndless rains weary the wandering floods,\nThe hollow silence harmonizes with my nature.\nThe garden’s depths offer a mirror for stillness,\nWithin, brightness aligns with purity.\n\nThe wind-swept ravine suddenly roars with cascades,\nLofty peaks fade into hidden depths.\nYoung bamboo sheds its first sheath,\nWildflowers scatter their last petals.\n\nFields and valleys deepen in summer green,\nAs time passes, worldly cares accumulate.\nThe dark and undivided hold to fate’s decree,\nI briefly share the gulls’ and egrets’ pact.\n\n---\n\n**Night Lodging in the Eastern Garden of Yousheng Abbey, Hangzhou**\n\nIn youth, my ambitions spanned seas and mountains,\nBefore manhood, I studied poetry and books.\nDeeply I admired the traces of mountain recluses,\nAt peace with the world’s contrary ways.\n\nOnce I wandered freely in Qiantang,\nNow I rest in this garden cottage.\nOld friends once shared close ties,\nNew acquaintances bring cautious joy.\n\nI recline in the shade of green paulownia,\nSinging aloud the Yellow Oriole’s song.\nBamboo by the window parts the first rain,\nMoonlight spills across the front steps.\n\nOranges swell with frost’s roundness,\nReeds stretch across the vast lake.\nFriends gather like cranes in a flock,\nMy idle heart aligns with lofty principles.\n\nAt the first word of parting,\nMy heart and steps grow distant.\nThe sunbird cries in the mournful wind,\nCold tides descend on the withered plain.\n\nFive years pass in fleeting moments,\nReflecting, I linger in hesitation.\nSeated, I feel the weight of time’s decay—\nWhy cling to the immortals’ constraints?\n\nAt dawn, I rouse my distant longing,\nResolved to return to my fields and garden.\nThe sound of Wang Qiao’s reed pipes and cranes\nSoars alone into the void.\n\n---\n\n**Basking in the Sun**\n\nI love the sun’s gentle warmth,\nThin clouds slowly disperse.\nThe barren mountains gather cold shadows,\nCourtyard trees stand sparse and withered.\n\nThe lowlands still lie submerged,\nYet the fields offer humble refuge.\nMillet and wheat fill the furrows,\nBut the harvest leaves many granaries bare.\n\nWhat can I do to set things right?\nThe world’s ways diverge from my path.\nHow could I know the joy of warmth,\nStill reaching the scattered and the frail?\n\nHeavy frost withers the hundred grasses,\nHidden blossoms mingle along the garden path.\nWhat offering could I make to you?\nOnly to clear the overgrowth within.\n\nThe vast spirit of high antiquity lingers,\nIts depths suffice for endless contemplation.\nI cast myself into the quiet shore,\nContent with this life’s measure.\n\nSurrounded by walls overgrown with brambles,\nCool shade covers the garden’s green.\nI endure the wind and rain’s assault,\nNever clashing with the world’s currents.\n\nFew visitors disturb my carriage’s wheels,\nFew thoughts bind my heart.\nI eat simple fare, seeking no excess,\nWearing worn clothes, sitting in meditation.\n\nYet old habits breed dust and obstruction,\nIllusions steep me in their warmth.\nIf I do not cherish what lies before me,\nFleeting distractions will chase one another.\n\nWho has plumbed the harmony of heaven and earth?\nMind and world await restoration.\nGreat indeed is the trigram *Gen*’s beginning and end,\nIts noble fruit joining the mountain’s trees.\n\n---\n\n**Gazing Over the Wilds**\n\nThe north wind whips the raging waves,\nThe river runs turbid, unclarified.\nOxen and dogs traverse the level ridge,\nTrees shed their leaves, mountains lie exposed.\n\nLight mist scatters across forest isles,\nA solitary bell tolls from the perilous city.\nMoored, I cannot sleep,\nThe long river murmurs through the night.\n\nMy worn clothes weary of travel,\nThe lingering rain brings the cold.\nWorldly moods shift between dawn and dusk,\nThis fleeting form—what shall it meet?\n\nThe reeds and mallows whisper mournfully,\nI can only sigh and clutch my breast.\nWhen the sky clears and the wind stills,\nMorning clouds drift past the distant geese.\n\nRiver grasses glimmer in faint sunlight,\nReed isles scatter wandering tracks.\nTurning homeward, my heart eases,\nWeary, I rest among the mugwort and thistles.\n\nMy form dwells within this bounded world,\nThis floating life follows nature’s end.\nSuccess or failure—why dwell on them?\nA hundred sorrows only vex the heart.\n\nHold to sincerity, return to nature,\nCultivate yourself in timely balance.\nWhen shall I cast off my clumsiness,\nForever trusting in the wind of Chao and Xu?\n\n---\n\n**Lodging at Qingyuan Abbey, Former Residence of the Immortal Ge**\n\nThe Dao’s pattern moves in subtle ways,\nThe perfected one hides his sacred traces.\nThis lofty structure stands in a famed town,\nOnce I wandered here, moved to the depths.\n\nFar from the dust of winding lanes,\nA winding path circles the crumbling pond.\nPond grasses thrive in evening dew,\nThe light pavilion echoes with tall pines.\n\nThe hall’s hempen curtains frame the vaulted image,\nIts splendor faded, I sigh for the remnants.\nMysterious threads follow the steps of practice,\nThe well’s turtle and the western beam endure.\n\nA separate chamber invites a shared drink,\nLamps flicker as the room stirs.\nThrough the night, my thoughts grow still,\nLooking up, I lament the lost legacy.\n\nAt dawn, I set out to explore,\nCautioning myself to diligent cultivation.\nThe divine work is not remote—\nThrough the ages, it illumines the dark.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Journey on the Second Day of the Third Month, Jiaxu**\n\nRain clears from the front peaks,\nI urge my staff along the homeward path.\nOvergrown trails wind through spring grasses,\nWild waters cross the level bridge.\n\nJoyful birds sing in round, clear tones,\nPlowing oxen tread with measured steps.\nAbundant springs murmur in shaded ravines,\nDense bamboo gleams in the inner garden.\n\nThe sacred peak opens to an airy pavilion,\nThorn gates guard the cloud-bound fastness.\nNew streams overflow the pond,\nLush greenery fills the windows.\n\nI sweep the terrace, arrange the scattered books,\nLeaning on my staff, I gaze through the brambles.\nHills and groves suit my delight,\nHow could I vainly admire the world’s filth?\n\nIn emptiness and detachment, I praise distant traces,\nYet perilous affairs caution my hidden tasks.\nHow could I sever worldly ties?\nOnly among trees and stones can I find deep refuge.\n\nWeary wings rest in the branch’s nest,\nThe lost may yet awaken to my understanding.\nFor now, I indulge my reclusive heart,\nLife’s meaning lies in the farmer’s plot.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the Former Site of Lord Wen’an’s Xiangshan Shrine**\n\nFu Xi and Yao embodied heaven’s movement,\nThe kingly Dao upheld the web of human relations.\nShun and Yu inherited the sacred vessel,\nTheir single-mindedness shone in transmission.",

      "translated_text": "**Ascending the Former Site of Lord Wen’an’s Xiangshan Shrine (continued)**\n\nWhen Zhou fell, the *Ya* and *Song* odes faded,\nConfucius spoke in alarm.\nYi Yin aided the mandate’s reception,\nWhile Mencius upheld its propagation.\nGreat was this profound canon’s mystery,\nIts radiance shining through a hundred generations.\nYet through decline and renewal it passed,\nBrightness and obscurity defying heaven’s constancy.\n\nThe Lu-Wang school revived the hidden lineage,\n*Jianzhong* continued the ways of Yu and Tang.\nLike uncut jade from Qingtian and Jingshan,\nIts vast renown gleamed pure and bright.\nThe heart’s inch governs the numinous and subtle,\nObscurity brings no harm to truth.\nMovement and stillness embrace the perfect principle,\nEver vigilant, one strengthens within.\n\nSacred teachings blaze like sun and stars,\nNoble conduct outshines ice and frost.\nHere, scriptures dwell in a land of grandeur,\nAncient traces deepen the primal resonance.\nSnowy halls gather by lamplight at night,\nSpring rains linger in the wind-swept courtyard.\nFrom Guan to Min, the branches spread,\nWhile Wu and Chu are graced by its lingering fragrance.\n\nMy dull nature shames my ignorance,\nYet I am fortunate to follow these teachings in detail.\nI ascend cloud-capped peaks to pay distant homage,\nWhere Buddhist shrines lie hidden in brambles and weeds.\nI seek out Lu’s former abode,\nWhere overgrown fields rise to lofty ridges.\nWith reverence, I gaze in awe,\nAs the autumn sky clears under the sun.\n\nEmerald terraces embrace the foreground,\nVast and distant, all returns to the finest trace.\nFleeting observations spur me to follow the ancients’ steps,\nDaring not to glimpse the boundless wilds.\nRapids rush past—who can stand as a pillar?\nThe great tone—who can serve as its phoenix?\nThe eight directions turn like wheels,\nA thousand years look up to this radiance.\n\n---\n\n**First Day of the New Year, Guihai Year**\n\nThe first sun alters the year’s course,\nLong rains at dawn begin to scatter.\nA gentle warmth heralds spring’s nurture,\nClouds and things thinly unfold.\nClear streams disperse along secluded banks,\nFine birds call through carved thickets.\nPlum blossoms drift along mossy paths,\nClusters of bamboo crisscross sparsely.\n\nPond duckweed gathers tender green,\nDense algae hold pure ripples.\nDelighting in these principles brings contentment,\nFor nature’s essence surely holds abundance.\nAnother year shames my aging teeth,\nMy dull learning—what end shall it find?\nAs dusk approaches, I guard solitude,\nThe girdle’s words are well worth inscribing.\n\n---\n\n**After the Lantern Festival, Rejoicing in Clear Skies, Ascending Jing Tong Hermitage**\n\nSpring’s warmth suffuses gentle harmony,\nMy frailty eases, my breath finds rest.\nThe hermitage stands in solemn emptiness,\nMy secluded quest now spans years.\nA narrow path is lost beneath fallen leaves,\nVines and creepers whisper through the void.\nPlum blossoms scatter lightly,\nBamboo and pine intertwine in splendor.\n\nStillness ever clears the spirit,\nSunlit peaks line the window like dark brows.\nLantern-lit nights mingle with market clamor,\nA lone crane soars beyond the sky’s bounds.\nI press my hand to my heart, filled with reverence,\nMy simple trust clings to profound reliance.\nWeary, I lean on the grove’s shade to return,\nHere I grasp the suspended solution.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Dream Crane Pavilion**\n\nThe perfected one attains the hidden meeting,\nHis steps and breath transcend form and sleep.\nThings transform like dreamt encounters,\nThe embryo immortal shares a numinous bond.\nIn the spirit’s realm, he chants in a stone chamber,\nThe worthy one hones his will through study.\nMoonlight over the pool rises through vine shadows,\nPeaks and forests adorn the courtyard in emerald.\n\nHis eastern writings embrace profound awakening,\nThe myriad beings illumined by balanced *qi*.\nLeaning on his desk, he hums the *Gao*’s melody,\nSerene and joyful, free from the slightest care.\nGraceful as the wind’s passage,\nSwift as a unicorn’s flight.\nI look back to the pavilion’s past elegance,\nButterflies and ants now scorn the dust’s neglect.\n\nWhat use is baldness to release from bondage?\nRiding in a carriage—empty as Duke Wei’s honor.\nSorrow and misfortune stir emotions,\nLife and death—who can cast them aside like Zhuangzi?\nEntangled in turmoil, all perishes,\nConcentrated in emptiness, floating visions are clarified.\nI shame my longing for cap and sash,\nYet spread my wings, urging my wheels to soar.\n\nIn vast harmony with the mountain’s disciples,\nA thousand years stretch into distant flight.\n\n---\n\n**Viewing the Dug Spring**\n\nThe hermit tends his plow and spade,\nDelighting as the spring’s source flows freely.\nDrawing water from afar brings no fear of toil,\nFinding the spring, he shares it with neighbors.\nServants grow weary yet rejoice,\nThe world calls it a divine work.\nTracing the source, the stream grows clearer,\nStones gleam, the ravine runs full.\n\nThe perfect transformation nurtures the primal sea,\nIts ceaseless flow vast and boundless.\nThe ten thousand differences share a single principle,\nTracing back reveals beginning and end.\nGathering the gaze, not even a ladle’s worth,\nYet who can fathom its day-and-night labor?\nI lament those dull and ignorant,\nWho fail to glimpse the root’s origin.\n\nFrom this, I embrace seclusion’s purity,\nDrinking and rinsing in the wind of Chao and Xu.\n\n---\n\n**Cold Rain**\n\nNight rain gathers lingering cold,\nMorning bells enter the wooded hills.\nWithered branches cry in the fierce wind,\nSpring torrents run clear enough to rinse.\nWoodcutters return to smoke-wreathed doors,\nMountain birds rest on frosted citrons.\nMy breast holds hidden sorrow,\nMy thoughts are calm, free from strife.\n\nFields and wilds grow daily barren,\nHeaven’s harmony fears injury.\nMy solitary heart—with whom to discuss?\nMy halting steps shame the worthy successors.\nGazing at the scene, I feel the ebbing tide,\nSeparation—who can bridge it?\nCultivating the heart lies in constancy,\nBrushing my sleeves, I cast off worldly dust.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Hall of Continuing Goodness**\n\nWhen the jade tablets emerged after Qin’s fall,\nHow many teachings nearly vanished?\nThe perfect principle lay buried in brambles,\nThe imperial heart—how could it stray?\n\nThe Lu-Wang school revived the fading thread,\nFrom this, heaven’s benevolence was seen.\nIntegrity and goodness are innate norms,\nPractice and study make them ever more true.\nClarity and subtlety share a single root,\nThe profound should be worn at the girdle.\nSurveying antiquity, I follow the sages’ counsel,\nBeginning and end—all is bright and pure.\n\nThe young scholar inherits his family’s learning,\nHis goodness upholds plain sincerity.\nMountain radiance glows with spring’s moisture,\nLush forests hold the evening’s mist.\nDiscourse and song harmonize with friends’ benefit,\nAdmonitions are well worth heeding.\nFrom this, I steel my resolve,\nThe ancients’ tracks are worth pursuing.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Cold Wind Terrace Painting**\n\nMaster Zhuang awoke to the myriad’s breath,\nWho can discuss *da sheng*?\nLooking up and down through the cosmos,\nDecline and flourishing are as fleeting as a hair’s weight.\n\nThis man admired steadfast conduct,\nResting here by woods and streams.\nBright moon crosses clear torrents,\nHis empty song enters the drifting clouds.\nFlying geese are too distant to glance at,\nHis lingering melody cherishes spring’s warmth.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on the Pure Capital Hermitage of the Spotless Chen Dongtang**\n\nEmbracing truth, he awakens to serenity,\nDelighting in this dwelling among woods and valleys.\nThe elephant’s foothills offer refined seclusion,\nAll encounters are old and familiar.\nPeaks gather around his desk,\nStone ravines twist and turn.\nAutumn rains resound in rushing torrents,\nSpring clouds moisten plow and hoe.\n\nA winding bridge steps over mossy paths,\nA remote isle connects to woodcutters and fishermen.\nLush trees offer evening repose,\nHills and gardens suffice for his joy.\nI know he has long left the dust behind,\nHis inner cultivation fittingly hidden in emptiness.\nHis forebears’ virtue matched his distant aspirations,\nTheir radiance ever accompanies him.\n\nYesterday, I visited his gate,\nMorning winds scattered yellow leaves.\nI bowed deeply, washing away distant longing,\nOur parting at dusk was deeply hesitant.\nHis pure teachings find few in the world to match,\nYet I have long held them in my breast, no fool.\nThe model belongs to the venerable,\nWho can follow its unfolding and rolling?\n\nMy past longings have grown vast and distant,\nMy secluded traces surely hold abundance.\nHis advanced years stand firm as a pine,\nHis dark bond is rich and true.\nI wish to receive the Pure Capital’s teachings,\nTo be shown the jade casket’s scriptures.\n\n---\n\n**Eastern Garden, Composed for Wang Jingzhou of Qiantang**",

      "translated_text": "The immortal transcendents lodge in hidden realms,\nShedding their traces to lightly float beyond the floating world.\nThe great recluses are not bound by worldly dust,\nForgetting form, they may dwell in secluded retreats.\nSuch a man possesses refined purity of bearing,\nUnfettering the mind to open the bound pavilion.\nHis fragrant garden vies in secluded construction,\nThe jade palace shuns gaudy splendor.\nAround his four walls flourish lush plants,\nThe empty courtyard spreads its first feast.\nBamboo grows thick with verdant feeling,\nCurtains and screens hang in emerald shade.\nWithin the yellow chamber, ritual classics reside,\nBefore the purple tower, dream clouds gather.\nRiding cranes, he traverses the notes of the sheng,\nRinsing at the well, he communes with cold springs.\nThe eastern dawn has long faded,\nYet dark virtue should be esteemed and advanced.\nLong ago, I wandered west in vast travels,\nWhere the numinous halls harmonized my circling steps.\nLofty paulownia shaded the sparse windows,\nThe crackling firewood heard the red strings’ music.\nEvening horns scattered the morning rain,\nAutumn tides followed the moon’s fullness.\nLakes and mountains slowed my leisurely steps,\nHow could worldly dust entangle me from without?\nThe venerable elders lent their aid and support,\nWith empty heart I wandered the Great Mystery.\nDo not delay in answering the Gate of Envy’s call,\nWith penetrating vision, perceive all things before they arise.\n\n---\n\n**Departing Jingkou at Dawn**\n\nThrough mist I set forth, the oars creak loudest,\nParting the river where perilous waves thin.\nThe cold city wears a sash of misty willows,\nAutumn waters embrace the wind-tossed reeds.\nLight rain dampens the forest’s southernwood,\nCongealed frost veils the islets’ withered grass.\nMy tiny boat meets the wild islet,\nI push open the secluded door to unfold old maps.\nThe quiet chamber reaches its utmost seclusion,\nWhite clouds linger beneath the eaves.\nTranscending worldly dust, I forsake high reclusion,\nLike Master Zizhen, I should dwell in valley retreat.\nHis posthumous writings fill the old tent,\nHis talent and feeling move the bound heavens.\nFine verses reveal his splendid literary grace,\nHis travels inquire of ancient ruins.\nSlanting mists suddenly form crystalline patterns,\nAs swift oars urge hastening words.\nPushing back the awning, I capture fleeting inspiration,\nExhorting myself to embrace tranquil emptiness.\nDistant blue mountains mark his path,\nThe ebbing tide hints at presence and absence.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending the True Man’s Chamber on Mount Fanghu**\n\nThe sacred peaks bear auspicious omens,\nWhere immortals wander in jade palaces.\nHis lofty aspirations are called outstanding,\nIn the divine capital, he pays homage to the flying dragon.\nDiscoursing with scholars of the Jade Hall,\nHis broad vision traces the tracks of golden steeds.\nBrush and ink double in value,\nYet he still recalls his forest wanderings.\nThe golden immortal bears the sea’s grace,\nThe dragon well nests on lofty peaks.\nSecret teachings suffice for casting the linchpin,\nConcentrating spirit, he guards the ring’s center.\nThrough rugged paths he traverses valleys and ravines,\nEarly forsaking the dust’s obscuring haze.\nIn Min and Yue, autumn’s sighs resound,\nClouds veil the forms of Yan and Tai.\nReturning east, he revives faded elegance,\nIn learning, we often follow one another.\nBrush and paper pour forth like sunrise,\nPainting and calligraphy pursue vast perfection.\nHis seal script reveals Han dynasty traces,\nClerical script humbles Qin’s seals.\nMy modest nature is dull and inferior,\nGrasping the inkstone through spring and winter.\nBy the stove and crucible, he sits amid plum snow,\nBy the tides and oysters, he chants to the creek’s wind.\nAdmiring orchids, he pours out the sea’s depths,\nHis wise discourse shines in Jiangdong.\nIn youth, he roughly possessed virtue,\nIn the capital, he toiled in attendance.\nFamous regions rely on his esteem,\nHow could noble rank and lofty status be prized?\nReturning with pendants, his hair already yellow,\nSuddenly withering amid the secluded cassia groves.\nSorrowful longing cuts deep in reverence,\nThe jade forest stands desolate and empty.\nTen years have passed in distant departure,\nSoaring high like the crane from Liaodong.\nMorning frost transforms the suburban scene,\nLibations and offerings hasten to thorn and thatch.\nOur literary bond shares sighs of lament,\nOur spiritual natures hope for hidden communion.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on Leisure**\n\nCeasing worldly ties, I lighten the dust’s harness,\nDispersing cares, I embrace tranquil emptiness.\nMountain rains deepen summer’s green,\nForest mists rise from twilight peaks.\nThe creek’s clamor presses near the courtyard,\nEmerald grass fills the deep pond.\nTall trees daily grow lush,\nYoung bamboo also casts cool shade.\nEach thing’s nature finds its own fitting place,\nFlourishing and fading share a single heart.\nSoaring high, I admire distant paths,\nChasing shadows is but vain pursuit.\nThe inscribed teachings illuminate past sages,\nIn solitude, I vigilantly guard against sinking.\nSubtle feelings I entrust to poems and scrolls,\nFew gather to discuss, why not lift the hairpin?\nThe wondrous principle is possessed by all,\nThe numinous source flows deep in hidden seeking.\nHow could I follow false traces,\nObstinately lingering in the empty forest?\n\n---\n\n**Morning Thoughts**\n\nEmerging at dawn, frozen thoughts already stir,\nA gentle wind fills the tall forest.\nThe fading river glimmers toward dawn,\nSparse stars fade in the wutong’s shade.\nVillage lanes wind beside distant islets,\nCocks crow, scattering the clustered woods.\nMorning mist veils the fragrant trees,\nNight’s haze lingers on lofty peaks.\nPine torrents cascade through the valleys,\nWalking alone, I traverse rugged paths.\nFalling branches are wet with scattered dew,\nA desolate coolness fills the empty space.\nDelighting in dwelling in secluded beauty,\nLong weary of the dust’s cage.\nStrolling the wilds, I indulge in leisure,\nHow could I be enslaved by mixed pursuits?\nRivers and springs fatten the carefree form,\nClouds and trees nourish the woodcutter’s heart.\nFar removed, I forsake worldly entanglements,\nSoaring high, I distance myself from ornate hairpins.\nFlowing springs echo the unhurried staff,\nStriking my zither in the hills.\n\n---\n\n**Ascending Mount Huagai**\n\nThe imperial carriage establishes the primal destiny,\nThe numinous traces reveal the divine foundation.\nSurpassing the great peak of Mount Hua,\nHis celestial truth long held the hidden handle.\nFortunate to follow and trace these steps,\nThis visit fulfills the earlier promise.\nProfound secrets open the dark teachings,\nAbundant merits adorn the deep rites.\nRefining form, he achieves the golden elixir,\nLaying down his halberd, he ascends the cinnabar radiance.\nKongtong’s cliffs open a cliffside altar,\nThe empty altar spreads a chessboard.\nThunder rumbles in the hollow caves,\nSpring veins contain cold moisture.\nTransforming scenes display mighty marvels,\nJade banners gleam in linked flight.\nDistant traces adorn successive generations,\nRivers and mountains vie in secluded wonder.\nIn late years, he receives his long-held admiration,\nClimbing and studying, he hastens to pursue.\nThe clustered mountains vie in hairpin adornment,\nThe side paths wind in perilous coils.\nFlying cliffs startle the spirit’s eyelashes,\nRevolving peaks race like jade dragons.\nClouds stretch like bright silk,\nWaters curve like delicate threads.\nValley echoes carry the bamboo’s sighs,\nForest fragrance scatters like coiling rainbows.\nJade palaces record their construction,\nIllusory blessings renew thatched huts.\nGuest lodges open to secluded views,\nEaves protect the cold mist.\nThe eight directions reach their limits,\nMyriad differences gather in subtle traces.\nThe world’s realm looks down upon the dust’s altar,\nHow lofty and low are Song and Hua!\nWeary, I rest amid mist and haze,\nGazing afar at the vast celestial steps.\nSupreme virtue shines in pure prayer,\nThe immortal’s plan fulfills hidden hopes.\nThe vast expanse merges in primal unity,\nWho can fathom its beginnings and ends?\n\n---\n\n**Visiting the Jade Prosperity Palace on West Mountain**\n\nBeyond the world, I deeply admire the distant,\nThe high immortals’ numinous traces.\nThe mighty capital stands by Jiang and Han,\nThe dark halls array the layered peaks.\nThe sun’s essence nurtures the heavens’ seasons,\nHeaven’s order shines on Jin’s eastern bounds.\nStrange dragons wreak people’s calamities,\nA foot-long sword achieves divine merit.\nDark construction commands wondrous beauty,\nThe supreme spirit is revered in succession.\nI, unworthy, am a true heir,\nTracing these steps is my proper path.\nCascading ravines pour forth singing rapids,\nFertile fields are veiled by sparse pines.\nWandering pines seem like village cottages,\nWinding paths echo with forest bells.\nWeighing cypresses stand in remaining lushness,\nDried springs flow with pure, faint murmurs.",

      "translated_text": "**Moss and Ruin**\n\nDesolate moss surveys the old structures,\nAncient sites thrive with dense, hidden thickets.\nThe tower’s wheels lodge in vast emptiness—\nWhere now is the radiance of cinnabar splendor?\nThe common folk are bathed in gracious blessings,\nDaoist disciples hold fast to profound devotion.\nRivers and hills ever revolve in motion,\nTheir governance reflects the august heavens.\nNight’s qi sobers the forest’s silence,\nSpring’s harmony scatters the gentle breeze.\n\nI secretly trace Jing Dan’s wondrous path,\nShedding the mundane—how could I follow later?\nI steel myself, gazing up at the tracks of the ancients,\nThe grand vista stretches boundless and endless.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at Chengzhai**\n\nThe square and round revolve through the six voids,\nStillness and movement ceaselessly interact.\nMotion and rest root in the primal origin,\nSubtle congealment pervades the Three Realms.\nHow vast is the heart of the worthy and sage!\nEmbodying sincerity, it abides in no fixed place.\nTheir profound teachings roused Zou and Meng,\nExhorting the self through inner vigilance.\nVigilant cultivation yields Confucian exemplars—\nYan’s dwelling upheld reverent caution.\nCultivation and nurture enhance clarity,\nSubtle mysteries emerge through remaining strength.\nBehold the workings of the primordial transformation:\nThe myriad beings mutually sustain and plant.\nWithin, this is the great root made firm;\nFlourishing and decay are but dust and pebbles.\nIf the wandering vapors are purified and clear,\nDark creation gleams like metal and stone.\nI aspire to master the art of return,\nVigorous practice aligns with the *Great Change*.\n\n---\n\n**Orchid’s Ascent**\n\nThe secluded orchid thrives in lofty bowls,\nDelighting in the warmth of the morning sun.\nThat sprout unfurls its fresh beauty,\nHidden, it flourishes with fragrant verdure.\nUpright in emptiness, its steadfast stem stands,\nLuminous hues diffuse its pure fragrance.\nIts nature finds affinity with the plain and true—\nHow could it exist for mere auspicious favor?\nYet here it rises in the forest’s depths,\nRemote and silent, unknown to the world.\nFine trees mingle with dense thickets,\nRenowned blossoms root in numinous soil.\nTheir grace surpasses all other flowers,\nTheir purity harmonizes with noble kin.\nVigorous growth in its prime,\nIt draws sustenance to nurture rare fragrance.\nGentle breezes brim with dewy splendor,\nDense mists condense in subtle perfume.\nRich rains moisten its lush abundance,\nRadiant light illumines the clustered greenery.\n\nIts refined conduct aspires to the sages’ model,\nThe *Li Sao* mourns Qu Yuan’s lament.\nWandering freely, I long to pluck and wear it,\nYet distant travels are but dust and vapor.\nThe empty chamber befits steadfast solitude,\nFellow wanderers grow ever more distant.\nAuspicious signs await early covenants—\nWhat need for haste between dawn and dusk?\nThe eight directions gather in vast vision,\nThe dark mechanism returns to the source of transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Xian Spring in Winter**\n\nAt dawn I tread, ashamed of my slow progress,\nReturning to rest amid the beauty of grove and valley.\nThe outskirts’ creatures harmonize with the seasons,\nWild paths embrace the winding stream.\nI speak of turning toward the white-clouded peaks,\nMist-laden trees retain their lingering green.\nShallow rapids guide the cold current,\nLofty ridges don the mantle of fine woods.\nBarren fields have yielded their harvest,\nSecluded dwellings nestle in forest huts.\nLong have I cherished tranquil serenity,\nMy wise words align with simple desires.\nA light wind washes the dust from my robe,\nA gentle rain nourishes my anointing.\nWeary, I rest—worldly ills fade,\nPerilous snares avoid even paper’s touch.\nEver have I hoped for Xian’s summons,\nMy refined conduct accords with steadfast solitude.\nWorldly taints surely entangle,\nYet the hidden true self ever suffices.\nShaking my garments, I ponder deeply,\nStriving in silence to rely on pine and chrysanthemum.\n\n---\n\n**Evening Banquet at Immortal Rock on the Twenty-Third of the Sixth Month**\n\nLast night’s rain dispelled autumn’s gloom,\nI sought the hidden, drifting on clear islets.\nAt dawn I prepared for the secluded tryst,\nTrue delight befits the waning heat.\nFlowers and petals display linked fragrance,\nElders and worthies excel in worldly discourse.\nGentle currents cradle shallow sands,\nDistant rapids secretly connect to the shore.\nSheer rocks scatter like the loom’s supports,\nThe limpid pool swirls with cobalt depths.\nDuckweed and gulls dot the snowy blossoms,\nSandpipers float like silver threads.\nWild vines darken the dense shade,\nDistant mountains girdle the light rain.\nI explore wonders to the farthest seclusion,\nOnly then do I find the path to Cloud Rock.\nThe numinous cavern coils with tiger and dragon,\nDivine traces open the hall’s doors.\nDeep moss obscures kitchen and granary,\nVerdant creepers drape the loom’s frame.\nA mighty whistle severs all dust and haze,\nAn empty song stirs the mist and fog.\nA single chamber hangs from the cliff,\nSeats arrayed on level sands for debate.\nThis gathering transcends the common—\nHarmony and awe mingle with cups and platters.\nHad I not attuned to the immortal’s tune,\nYears would pass like Penglai’s isles.\nSincerely I visit the ancient shrine,\nAshamed my steps lag behind the dust.\n\nRed Mound commands the wild and strange—\nFitting that wind and thunder guard it.\nThrough boundless kalpas, I view fleeting bubbles,\nA single impulse washes away a thousand ages.\n\n---\n\n**Composed While Watching the Rain**\n\nEarly summer suffers from ceaseless rain,\nTowering trees luxuriate in lush growth.\nThe stream roars with sudden surging torrents,\nThe peaks stand pure, residual haze bright.\nLush greenery shades the eaves and pillars,\nTall bamboos lend their cool to the secluded.\nHeavy burdens of human affairs grow rare,\nMud and mire halt the wheels’ progress.\nFor now, I find solace in letters and ink,\nHolding to the Dao lies in nurturing and following.\nHidden virtue embraces the abyss within,\nFrom the subtle it reaches the vast and deep.\nDare I hope for recognition like the Mo and Si?\nI can only sigh in admiration of the lofty mountain.\nYin accumulates, succeeding the scorching heat,\nI shame myself for worldly thoughts.\nSitting, my mind wanders to the sun’s song,\nVast and boundless as the source’s spring.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed at Jingzhai**\n\nEnduring principles possess constant nature,\nSacred teachings restore the primal origin.\nPure essence, inherently good and keen,\nThe Confucian school treasures its jade-like brilliance.\nThe *Odes* and *Documents* tread the ancients’ path,\nThrough a hundred generations, they bloom anew.\nHolding reverence lies in unity,\nSolemn and respectful, I roam the vast dwelling.\nLakes and mountains stand in solemn splendor,\nLeisurely joys match the river’s perch.\nIn office during a clear reign,\nI partook in the *Canon* and *Counsels*.\nGentle and profound, I harmonized with dark simplicity,\nMy refined bearing illuminated the realm.\nAbundant cultivation hopes for lush growth,\nInheritance and succession await the heir’s gaze.\n\n---\n\n**Occasional Verse on a Late Outing**\n\nThe bright pond brims with fragrant islets,\nNew currents swell in joyful surges.\nDark clouds drift past the rustling trees,\nThe sheer ravine scatters the cold mist.\nHuman tracks grow sparse in mud and mire,\nTwilight deepens with birds and frogs.\nDistant thoughts stir memories of past trysts,\nClustered cares weigh on pressing duties.\nResting in seclusion, I attain this ease,\nYet worldly concerns still entwine and coil.\nVain traces chase the dust’s birth,\nThe true source wondrously abides nowhere.\nSpring’s splendor swiftly yields to another year,\nFrailty and age deepen my shame and longing.\nGain and loss follow the workings of transformation,\nHills and gardens suffice for measured steps.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Rain**\n\nEarly heat returns to the old dwelling,\nThe vermilion sun’s fire grows ever fiercer.\nLying ill beneath the central grove,\nI recline in stillness, free of care.\nThe windy ravine roars with rushing streams,\nField frogs croak amid dense thickets.\nFish glide lightly through fragrant algae,\nMist settles over the towering forest’s shade.\nVerdant feelings rise in tall bamboos,\nThe empty courtyard thrives with intertwined branches.\nGathering clouds suddenly form a downpour,\nAll night the torrents rush in.\nThe lotus storm crosses the morning’s chill,\nI cast aside my hairpin to tend the brambles.\nSmoke and waves stretch far, free of dust,\nHeart and trace remain serene, lofty, and aloof.\nHow could I compare to the mosquito’s drone?\nWhy trouble myself with birds’ play?\nVainly I sigh—my long-held aspirations thwarted,\nConfinement deepens my distant yearning.\nAnxieties and indignation remain unresolved,\nFor now, I find solace in the flowing stream.\nI speak of following the recluses’ path,\nForever parting from the human world.\n\n---\n\n**Composed While Walking the Southern Ravine**",

I rejoice in the whistling of Su Men’s heights.\n\nHeaven’s decree binds my inmost heart, in silent stillness I guard the subtle workings of the Dao.\nPity the narrow-minded, who day and night consume themselves in flames.\nAll transformations must find their return—casting aside my hairpin, I take up fishing rod and line.\nHandle and socket fit not where they’re forced; steadfast integrity need not gleam.\nFlattery swiftly turns to wolves, mercy and pardon depend on the light of wisdom.\n\nAfter the snow, early spring returns.\nThe recluse cherishes pure wandering, steadfast in solitary virtue.\nWinter’s long mildness brings joy; returning, I tend to firewood and herds.\nThe clamor of dust is washed away at once, the vast and empty long content me.\nSnow and frost veil layered clouds, wind-swept cliffs stand with lone trees.\nThe first plum holds all fragrance, dried pools seep with cold green.\nOpening the window, I arrange old scrolls; lighting kindling, I trim the bright candle.\n\nI grieve at the world’s snares entangling me, weary, I shed its bonds.\nForcing myself through treacherous paths, I find overgrown trails where pines and chrysanthemums wither.\nFortunate to receive the gaze of enlightened favor, I lay bare my past regrets.\nWho among later scholars will take up the hairpin and saw? I only long for the company of deer and friends.\nThis age’s miasma drives me to haste, its twisted wheels crush my heels.\nMy heart scorns the carriage’s path—how could high or low be mere fence and touch?\nI wish to join the silent and secluded, washing my ears by the winding stream.\nNot lacking the butcher’s whetstone, I shame myself for chasing sheep in flattery.\nMy mat warmed by Gou Lou’s pines, my oar awaits Shan Yin’s bamboo.\nI entrust myself to the year’s cold season, ice and frost nurturing withered fragrance.\n\nAs dark yin yields to spring, how swiftly time flows!\nAwakening to illusion’s fleeting nature, I see emptiness holds no desire.\nHow base are those who chase perch and trout, who rush for carp and rot!\nA thousand years pass in idle words—raising my voice, I return to the deep valley.\n\n**Early Autumn Rain at a Mountain Dwelling**\nSummer’s rain melts into autumn’s chill, faint clouds dampen the lonely wheel rut.\nSeeking the source, I visit my old hut; climbing the ridge, I find homes far away.\nRice lies low beneath the crossbeam gate, a sacred spring gushes from hidden peaks.\nQuiet summits gleam with jade-green hue, fallen leaves spread across lofty ridges.\nMorning calls mingle with fine birds, my steps leave no mark on silent moss.\nNew streams wind around the courtyard, plants grow lush with verdant feeling day by day.\n\nEmbracing this love for the central grove, how could I be bound by worldly dust?\nThough my body is broken, I trust in great years; clumsy, I follow the crooked path.\nNot lacking the company of Sun Deng, I still hold Ge Hong’s encouragement in mind.\nHaving seen the world, I bid farewell to drifting duckweed; how could my wild passions be shallow and clear?\nI celebrate Master Li of Le An Hall on his eightieth year.\n\n**For Master Li of Le An Hall on His Eightieth Birthday**\nThrough countless kalpas, long life endures; like mountains, the tortoise and crane endure.\nThe celestial court belongs to the virtuous elder, great years rightly bestowed early.\nAwakened to illusion, he has long savored harmony; in his jade chamber, he sips the essence of blossoms.\nNourished by the plain words of Confucianism, he preserves and nurtures his sincerity.\nJoy resides in the humble gate’s gatherings, in winter’s cold, his hall stands deep and sturdy.\nMorning winds bring timely rain, evening waters still in autumn’s dusk.\n\nHis will is firm in refined bonds, delighting in the alliance of cap and coarse cloth.\nCloud-waves wash his jasper mat, moon-dew fills golden stems.\nAt peace with simplicity, he adorns himself like a turtledove; gracefully, he follows the steady path of the rushes.\nOutlasting the sun’s glow, his name stands as a model for sacred peaks.\nThe dark reckoning lingers in slow years, his hidden truth guards the host of spirits.\nThus his white hair endures forever, his penetrating gaze transcends the divine classics.\n\n**Wandering the Immortal Crag**\nThe sacred peak crowns Penglai’s realm, autumn’s clarity brings crisp and cool qi.\nI drive my words beyond the world’s bounds, casting my oar to roam the profound and secluded.\nStreams and islets embrace winding paths, shoals and rapids rise in meandering ascent.\nThe River Lord’s palace emerges from water, heaven’s loom weaves brocade as a screen.\nThe immortal altar stands on Han’s foundation, tiger roars echo through empty space.\nGazing in reverence, I step into the jasper palace, where cinnabar cliffs array wondrous forms.\n\nCelebratory brew fills my gourd, Meng Ji’s silk still spins on the loom.\nSeeking and exploring, my interest wanes and waxes; my unbound spirit surpasses past longings.\nThe great vessel towers like a flying tower, refined gold blazes in the vaulted image.\nEvening libations end solemn discourse, each talent pursues their own measure.\nAt dawn, we depart from the limpid pool’s edge, gentle ripples ripple in vast expanse.\n\nThe immortal’s traces venture into peril and strangeness—what sorrow could surpass this itch?\nJiang’s quilt stirs deep feeling, Chen’s glue envies flowing talent.\nWang Gong’s appearance grows ever purer, Wu Meng’s will must be vast.\nWords sharp as Yuan Hong’s, discourse as rich as Guo Xiang’s.\nIslands and islets lie hidden like Peach Blossom Spring, riverbanks and hamlets flourish in view.\n\nWho asks the way to this world’s end? Illusory words—why deceive with floating lies?\nSparrows and quails chase dust like equals, the literary unicorn shames worldly thoughts.\nEarth’s expanse stretches beyond Qi and Bo, heaven’s music knows no bounds between sky and soil.\nContent, why cling like monkeys? Trusting, gulls come and go freely.\nI prepare to sip chrysanthemum blossoms, gazing afar—who yields to the past?\nBrowsing lightly, I record what I’ve seen; my distant thoughts fix on the empty and vast.\n\nGlory and decay swiftly shift through ancient and modern—let refined bearing test bold abandon.\nIf not of gold and stone, one must miss the dark pearl’s net.\nRaising my head, I await the immortal’s return—how could I forget the lofty wind?\n\n**Setting Out at Dawn on the Divine River**\nAt dawn, I set out on the sacred stream, my distant intent drawn to the river’s trees.\nWild huts cling to village dwellings, morning mist scatters over cold islets.\nWheels pound distant rapids, bathing birds drift on deep shores.\nFrost and dew linger in thickets, layered peaks rise like phoenixes folding their wings.\n\nReturning home brings its own comfort, parting stirs thoughts of kin and old friends.\nLong estranged from worldly hopes, our bond shines bright as the morning star.\nMy haste was never long—how swiftly the seasons turn to dusk!\nDrinking from my gourd, I feel little ease; loosening my robe, I rest in scattered dew.\n\n**Moonlit Night After Snow Clears**\nNorthern snow clears at dawn’s glow, peaks stand like heaps of blue jade.\nLingering in the empty forest’s gaze, my free spirit soars through heart and eye.\nA wild boat drifts on the fading current, desolate mist thins over sparse huts.\nLayered branches flourish with elegant form, thickets hold the last of winter’s green.\n\nHolding rare aspirations for this vast world, I refine my heart to few worldly desires.\nMy secluded dwelling delights in reclusion’s virtue, my many scrolls rely on past exhortations.",

I muse the while.\n\n**Winter Night in the Hermitage**\nSpring stirs before the year’s last days are done,\nI lie abed in my mountain home alone.\nCold bamboo bars the path to garden’s gate,\nPlum blossoms cast their glow on books I contemplate.\nThe spring’s voice scorns the barking dog’s harsh cry,\nIts ripples startle fish that leap on high.\nAll things bear the pulse of life’s unceasing play—\nIn emptiness, I find my joy’s full sway.\n\n**Inscribing \"Autumn Colors of the Jade Grove\"**\nA celestial terrace rises, wrought with grace,\nJade trees encircle the vault of azure space.\nAutumn’s hues half-veiled by rain’s soft screen,\nPine winds gust along the threefold garden’s green.\nClouds’ moods retreat to the reclusive hall,\nThe ravine’s tones mingle with tung and wutong’s call.\nI strive to follow those who’ve led before,\nUnfurling hidden schemes on Hua and Song’s high shore.\n\n**Inscribing \"Secluded Autumn Mountains of Square Gourd\"**\nThe northern park holds boundless, subtle art,\nAutumn mountains fill the gaze from near and far.\nA humble bridge connects the post road’s thread,\nAn aged hut stands ‘mid frost-kissed maples’ red.\nEvening’s chill seeps in after passing rain,\nScattered clouds dissolve in the hush of sky’s domain.\nBy chance, this place becomes my hermitage’s seat—\nFew traces of the world’s dust here do meet.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (I)**\nI love mountain dwelling’s quiet, unconfined,\nNo wants suffice to nurture truth refined.\nAutumn’s voice arrives in the seventh, eighth moon,\nMountain hues shared by two or three alone.\nThough my steps grow faint, my heart knows no dim shade,\nThough my body’s poor, the Dao is never laid.\nGazing at the vast transformations’ play,\nI scratch my head, ashamed of red dust’s sway.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (II)**\nI love mountain dwelling’s stark simplicity,\nYears stretch long in quiet austerity.\nIn stillness, I perceive the Dao’s vast span,\nIn leisure, sense the rush of life’s swift plan.\nSummer rains make clouds whiter still,\nAutumn winds turn chrysanthemums to gold’s chill.\nHow fine to sit with feet drawn in,\nWorldly cares no longer cling or pin.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (III)**\nI love mountain dwelling—here I know at last\nThat things and self are one, their fates entwined and vast.\nWind and clouds are but the ruts of passing wheels,\nHeaven and earth a single ring that seals.\nLife’s transformations turn without cease,\nRound and square hold mysteries without release.\nInhaling, exhaling—all is bound,\nYielding, I follow east or west unbound.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (IV)**\nI love mountain dwelling, where engagements fade,\nStillness and clamor like an anthill’s trade.\nGatherings and teachings—spider’s artifice,\nEmotions breed the self, the other’s vice.\nAction and concealment show what’s right or wrong,\nWho heeds the words of Meng’s old song?\nOnly this heart, so faint, so fine,\nPerceives the truth in silence’s design.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (V)**\nI love mountain dwelling—creeping vines repair\nMy brushwood gate with nature’s quiet care.\nThe peaks themselves assume their roles as guest and host,\nDistant rapids hum like zither’s ghost.\nDogs grow still as village twilight falls,\nMountain depths bring rain that misty veils install.\nWhen night deepens and all motion ceases,\nJade-like tones alone in chanting increases.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (VI)**\nI love mountain dwelling—years pass in still repose,\nWind and frost reveal the stalwart pine’s repose.\nIce and snow confront the cold plum’s steadfast grace,\nNurturing the fire, the Three Palaces’ debate I chase.\nA hundred cares dissolve in spirit’s ease,\nYet without the cicada’s molt, no freedom sees.\nCast wide, unbound—this is true release.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (VII)**\nI love mountain dwelling—here I gather in\nThe heart that wandered through ten thousand ages’ din.\nDrifting delights in the rushing torrent’s might,\nStilled, I see the gold’s pure, unalloyed light.\nThe world sees only change as constant state,\nHuman feelings gauge but shallow and deep’s weight.\nKongtong holds no other savor’s claim—\nI vow to age within these woods’ domain.\n\n**I Love Mountain Dwelling (VIII)**\nI love mountain dwelling—cold and warmth I heed no more,\nRivers and lakes hold no dreams of yore.\nFew new friends, the old now few,\nI follow my lot, let the world misconstrue.\nWords fill my scrolls with parables wide,\nYet when shall this end? I cannot decide.\n\n**Inscribing Wang Yuan’s Eight Poems**\n\n**Spring Clouds over Eastern Gorge**\nStone ravines shaped by clouds’ own hand,\nA realm of minor immortals grand.\nCold creeps into the grassy pool’s dream,\nNight rain startles the sleeper’s scheme.\nVillage turns past the neighbor’s tree,\nBlossoms drift where the weir’s waters flee.\nSeeking immortality, not pride’s display,\nI’ve lingered here year upon year’s sway.\n\n**Stone Terrace on Northern Ridge**\nSeeking truth in mountain and marsh’s keep,\nI turn scriptures into a stone terrace steep.\nEvening mist rises from ancient trees,\nSpring crows alight on plum blossoms’ freeze.\nFeathered pendants glide through clouds’ embrace,\nDivine oars return from the sea’s vast space.\nLooking down on the boundless shore,\nWhere is the land untouched by dust’s lore?\n\n**Lush Scenery of Southern Hill**\nSouthern mounds stand fair, their beauty bright,\nIndigo and blue fill the seat’s sight.\nOne should drink like swordsmen bold,\nOr carry books and hoe the field of old.\nAutumn’s chill brings yellow leaves in store,\nDeep streams ask where white fish roam and soar.\nHow fine to keep half an acre’s claim,\nTo share its quiet, hidden frame.\n\n**Autumn Moon over Western Stream**\nMoonlight chills the night’s first freeze,\nStreams flow clear on either side with ease.\nStars hang slant by the eaves’ low edge,\nWind and dew mingle with the spring’s pledge.\nA lone boat drifts past sandy shoals,\nAutumn hills conceal the ancient walls.\nFishermen’s songs bring wild tunes near,\nWinding paths twist, then disappear.\n\n**Pines and Chrysanthemums by the Thatched Hall**\nA grass-thatched hut beside the farmer’s plot,\nSurrounded by plants I’ve nurtured and wrought.\nNo wine to toast a departing official’s cheer,\nYet songs of thatched roofs bring solace here.\nAfter snow, I wander late, chanting low,\nIn autumn’s depth, I eat what nature bestows.\nLong have I probed the furnace and elixir’s art—\nHow near is retreat? I question my heart.\n\n**Mulberry and Hemp of the Old Garden**\nPlanting plots with mushrooms and herbs rare,\nHoeing through the years with patient care.\nMulberry and hemp bear life’s intent,\nVillage groves share their shade’s extent.\nRain swells the woods and ponds’ embrace,\nSpring’s chill lingers in the fields’ deep space.\nEvening talks hold no idle word,\nIn old age, true hearts are heard.\n\n**Clear Springs of a Distant Well**\nWells apart hold springs so pure and bright,\nTheir cool, clear flow meets at the source’s light.",

unfolds ten thousand years of autumnal clarity,\nA hundred lords gaze in reverence, moved by the Sage’s grace.\nGolden tablets borne on clouds escort the imperial chariot,\nBrocade robes suffused with sunlight gleam upon the palace halls.\nRites performed by inner scribes—fragrant seals draw near,\nMusic of the palace court resounds with joyous radiance.\nThis grand ceremony, so noble and profound, shall endure through ages,\nYet I, in humble garb, stand shamed amid such boundless favor.\n\n**Composed Upon Receiving the Imperial Summons to Return to the Mountains on the Twenty-First Day of the Ninth Month, Guiyou Year**\nThe new pavilion of Xuanpu floats with royal qi,\nSwift steeds bear the imperial decree to the celestial court.\nThe emperor’s words descend from the palace, melting the sunlit day,\nHeaven’s guards attend the throne, solemn in autumn’s purity.\nIn rustic robes, I am permitted to tend pine and chrysanthemum,\nHow dare I, in lofty rank, compare to phoenix or simurgh?\nThe emperor’s grace runs deep—what can I offer in return?\nWith loyal heart, I gaze in reverence at his grand design.\n\n**In Reverent Awe of the Sacred Discourse on the Marvel of Divine Immortals Presenting Elixirs, Which Illuminates the Teachings—Composed in Joy to Record the Event**\nThe Sage Emperor embodies the Dao, perfecting the subtle net,\nFrom Mount Lu, famed immortals bestow longevity and health.\nEven Dongfang Shuo could not monopolize Han Wu’s favor,\nWhile Guangchengzi awaited the Yellow Emperor’s audience.\nA thousand springs of crane-like years—cinnabar’s wondrous art,\nNinefold steps before the dragon countenance—jade nectar’s glow.\nThe imperial words flow gently, filling me with boundless joy,\nThis humble servant leaps in praise, chanting ever more fervently.\n\n**Early Court on the First Day of Spring**\nAt dawn, I hasten to the celestial guard to hail the advent of spring,\nDelighted to witness the return of yang and the Sage’s renewed virtue.\nBy chance, I tend flocks where cranes roam the forbidden grounds,\nWhile colored oxen bear dew to the maple hall.\nA thousand officials, sashed in jade, raise voices in gladness,\nTen thousand guards, banners unfurled, harmonize the land’s qi.\nFrom this day forth, great harmony shall perfect governance—\nI, a rustic from the hills, look up to the imperial decree.\n\n**Accompanying the Sacrificial Rites at the Imperial Ancestral Temple**\nBright torches illuminate the temple gates in solemn splendor,\nJade steps and immortal processions gleam in daylight’s radiance.\nThe Son of Heaven descends to the ritual vessels and sacred tripods,\nThe imperial carriage pauses, robes aglow in the sun’s embrace.\nTen thousand guards, banners fluttering, encircle the Phoenix Pavilion,\nA thousand officials, plumes aligned, stand in ranks like cranes.\nThis humble servant, from the wilds, rejoices in the ancestral rites,\nMay the dynastic succession henceforth tread a path of a hundred blessings.\n\n**Early Court on New Year’s Day, Jisi Year**\nThrough the fifth watch, morning bells stir the palace gates,\nI lift my gaze to the celestial towers, where dawn clouds align.\nAt the palace wings, jade pendants jingle north of the fragrant carriage,\nFrom the lofty pavilion, bridles chime west of the colored ranks.\nSnow’s hue reaches the green-tiled gates in the distance,\nSpring’s light stirs the embroidered saddles’ mud.\nAll pray the emperor’s grace will fall like sweet rain,\nWhile rivers and mountains gain years, moved by the phoenix’s rule.\n\n**Early Court and Imperial Banquet on the Winter Solstice**\nThe day welcomes the solstice, mild as spring’s return,\nHeaven’s guard stands in full display—rites and music arrayed.\nThe imperial chariot gleams with starlight in the silver candle’s glow,\nJade girdles press against snow, brocade saddles renewed.\nFlowers brighten the inner chambers, where green-tiled doors open,\nWillows brush the palace robes as they attend the purple throne.\nDeeply shamed to join the ranks of egrets and herons,\nI share in the joy of the Sage’s virtue spreading pure benevolence.\n\n**Imperial Banquet in the Huagai Hall on the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month, Guiyou Year**\nDawn’s city veiled in mist and rain,\nOn this auspicious day, the feast begins beneath the emperor’s favor.\nDark halls and damp clouds obscure the grotto paths,\nThe palace river’s sparse willows fringe the imperial precincts.\nChrysanthemum petals float in palace wine, brimming the cups,\nOrchid dew drifts through the courtyard, where garden trees stand sparse.\nAncestral blessings shower me with imperial grace,\nIn crane robes, I can only feel my unworthiness.\n\n**Imperial Gift of Robes on the Ninth Day**\nTwice I have received the emperor’s favor, bestowed with palace robes,\nFrom the jade hall, the decree is proclaimed—I am shamed by such fortune.\nEnvoys from the imperial wardrobe add feathered pendants,\nHonors from the lofty pavilion summon the spirit’s pride.\nFragrant silk gleams in the sun, floating in azure hues,\nLight silk sways in the breeze, rippling like green waves.\nMy devotion to the state must be repaid with utmost sincerity,\nMay this pure radiance ever adorn my humble station.\n\n**Imperial Gift Received on the Ninth Day of the Tenth Month**\nAgain, extraordinary grace descends in resplendent decree,\nMy mountain retreat and terrace halls suddenly shine with glory.\nMy name, heard at the green-tiled gates, is passed by the chamberlains,\nThe edict, issued from the yellow doors, appoints me a provincial official.\nRosy clouds steep the wine of the Marshal’s office,\nSnow-like flakes pile high with the meat of the imperial kitchen.\nYet I, in rustic garb, know not what I can offer—\nI only wish to see the common folk relieved of hunger and want.\n\n**Imperial Gift of Ritual Robes on the Twenty-Seventh Day of the Eleventh Month, Guiwei Year**\nThe inner eunuch hastens with the decree from the palace of medicine,\nGolden robes and rainbow hues—I bow in profound gratitude.\nIncense smoke and starry constellations illuminate the three realms,\nThe imperial procession and windswept clouds face the ninefold gates.\nThe emperor’s grace, like rain, soaks the land of Yu’s tribute,\nHis royal way, vast as heaven, sings of Yao’s dominion.\nDeeply shamed by my meager worth—what can I add?\nDare I await the bridge’s collapse to pay homage to Red Pine?\n\n**Staying at Chaotian Palace, Presented to Master Wang Dongbai, the Alchemist**\nThe jade altar touches autumn’s lofty air,\nI alone, a mountain dweller, feel shamed among the venerable.\nLong vines drape the market gates, jade locks secure,\nDense bamboo surpasses men, golden blades gleam.\nAt dawn’s rain, I lean on my desk, lost in study,\nAt dusk’s chill, I regret my lack of a crane robe.\nFortunate to have the Master of Huayang as my neighbor,\nA lone crane cries at midnight in the nine marshes.\n\n**Inscribed on *Clouds and Mist Over Myriad Valleys of Fanghu*, a Painting**\nThe immortal of Fanghu, peerless in sea and mountain spirit,\nAccustomed to gathering qi, merging with the vast blue.\nCloudy peaks and distant mists condense in misty hues,\nMisty isles and faint ripples echo the distant shoals.\nI imagine seeking the grottoes of Lingfeng and Goulou,\nWho among the dust-bound kalpas could speak of Mieming?\nIn vain I sigh for the lofty winds of Mount Song’s solitude—\nWhat are the Eight Steeds compared to the sweat of a thousand miles?\n\n**Mid-Autumn Gathering with Zhou Zhenbai at the Zhanbi Pavilion**\nAutumn’s hues divide the equinox, the moon is perfectly round,\nIn joyful discourse, we share a splendid feast.\nTripods and ritual vessels bear the marvels of Qin’s craft,\nTadpole script preserves the legacy of Han’s calligraphy.\nDew spills fragrant wine, congealing in lustrous beauty,\nLush jade trees stand graceful in the garden’s glow.\nFew now remain of the venerable elders of Penglai—\nFortunate to spread pure fragrance and delight in long years.\n\n**Viewing My Old Collection of *Lingpi Jade*, with Thoughts of Its Former Owner**\nMysterious jade, strange peaks nurture numinous essence,\nNine heavens’ clouds and mists arise again at night.\nYanshan’s chamber holds the immortal pearl’s tears,\nWu’s isles and misty waves mingle with the Wei’s streams.\nCrane calls often moisten my bookshelf,\nDragon’s radiance at times brightens my inkstone.\nThe mountain man once aspired to Kongtong’s longevity—\nSerene and steadfast, he roots in heaven’s mystery to repay its wonders.\n\n**Inscribed on *Autumn Thoughts in the Cloudy Mountains of Fanghu*, a Painting**\nJade-like peaks stand tall in dawn’s chilly emerald,\nBest viewed from the eastern pavilion in tranquil contemplation.\nFrost-kissed forests and windblown dew hold pearls’ luster,\nAutumn waters and lotus blooms spill like unspooled silk.\nClogs cast aside, I tread the wild paths,\nWho now leans on a long pole, angling alone?\nFrom the northern park, my spirit naturally communes—\nI am content with these cloudy mountains for my tray of stones.\n\n**Inscribed on *Lofty Depths of Sea and Mountains*, a Painting by Fanghu**",

      "translated_text": "**Inscribed on the Pine and Bamboo Pavilion**\n\nBeyond the lordly gates, a detached lodge stands west of the five clouds;\nIts limpid groves and valleys rival the crane’s perch.\nMoonlight spills over golden balustrades, weighting the drooping willows;\nThe wind turns silver goblets as fallen blossoms bow low.\nA crane-feather cloak gleams like snow, awaiting the tide-borne magpie;\nA single peak glows with spring’s dawn, waiting for the crowing cock.\nHow could lofty joy compare to mountain solitude?\nIts radiant splendor vies with heaven’s height.\n\n**Inscribed on the Pine and Bamboo Pavilion**\n\nNoble kinsmen’s towering gates lean on embroidered screens,\nYet pine and bamboo still guard their verdant grace.\nClouds gather round the pavilion, where thatched peaks rise fair;\nSnow’s hue invades the gate, where carved waters pause.\nCrimson doors and green tassels catch the evening glow;\nBroidered saddles and silver candles bear the stars of spring.\nHow could reclusive longing match the mountain dweller’s taste?\nThe frost-brushed stone and icy stream ring clear.\n\n**Inscribed on the Hall of Congealed Purity**\n\nLofty halls rise amid autumn’s emerald trees,\nTheir pure fragrance swirling to strengthen the divine land.\nFlowers congeal in mist, their pendants hanging still;\nThe wind bears river waves as moonlight fills the tower.\nAt dusk, the Yellow Chamber echoes the *Parrot’s Rhapsody*;\nIn spring, the Jade Terrace warms the quail’s heart.\nA glorious name delights in outshining the port’s radiance—\nIn rustic garb, I shame the soaring roc.\n\n**Banquet at the Tranquil Abyss Studio**\n\nWe bid the immortal’s pavilion and Fangzhu’s vessel,\nTrue delight—why entrust it to painted scrolls?\nEmbroidered chambers greet the wind with water-chestnut and algae;\nBroidered pillars wear mist like calamus and bulrush.\nFeasts unfold in daylight, steaming the valley of rosy clouds;\nTerraces overlook autumn waves, threading moonlit pearls.\nIn my plain robes, I alone blush for my meager fare—\nYet how could bridle and bit yield to Shu Hao?\n\n**A Recluse Presents Two Stalks of Purple Ganoderma**\n\nTowering forests weave jade hues into a numinous form;\nAn old man from the wilds knows to gather and present them.\nDark mist lifts the branches, transforming them to jasper;\nPure clouds drape like canopies, birthing jade’s marrow.\nThe Daoist by the clear stream indulges his mountain passion;\nThe Master of Jiao’s Vale lives untouched by the world’s doubt.\nTogether we age amid wind and frost in these hills and streams—\nWhy should auspicious omens shame refined words?\n\n**Visiting the Waterfall Grotto**\n\nA secluded grotto’s twin gates open into boundless dark;\nJade groves cast their shade as we tread in succession.\nTiered cliffs let pearls fall as the curtain draws the cascade;\nLayered peaks unfold like brocade, lining the pillars.\nI still seek the whistling master to strike the stone;\nI long to grasp the vines and await Qiu Sheng.\nThe crags and slopes lie beneath the forest’s twilight haze—\nThe zither’s strings pour out the world’s beyond emotions.\n\n**Gathering Jade-Plums Among the Peach Trees**\n\nThe peach pool is the immortals’ own planting,\nIts branches most beloved where azure seas drip.\nNongyu washes her rouge with mica’s screen;\nFeiqiong arranges her brushes on the water nymph’s steps.\nA startled wind stirs not the dust of kalpas;\nDew’s touch congeals like snow upon its skin.\nPlucked for the mountain window in sleepless quiet,\nI seem to hear the sheng’s notes and cranes descending to the curtained study.\n\n**Drinking at the Deep Azure Pavilion: Ode to a Stalactite Cup**\n\nStalactite wine pours amid flowering herbs,\nA flying spring most joyous for the immortal’s home.\nIt whitens robes like silk by the window;\nIt reddens cheeks like dawn’s glow, lacking only rosy clouds.\nI shame myself for drunken revels like Lun and Yu;\nIts literary brilliance befits Zhang Hua.\nMy fading form still borrows its nurturing strength—\nWhy seek more on the Double Ninth?\n\n**Inscribed on a Painting of Red Cliff**\n\nHow could his mighty prose alone surpass Zhuang and Qu?\nThrough ages, lofty sentiment reveres his pure fate.\nA night moon’s skiff passed Xiakou;\nAutumn winds leaned on the wild hut at Lingao.\nThe legacy of Zhou Lang lingers in the lone crane;\nZhuge’s loyal spirit swells the mighty waves.\nI imagine Snow Hall embracing two guests—\nThe painting awaits a master’s brush to capture its marvel.\n\n**Inscribed on *Meng Haoran Treading Snow***\n\nBeyond Deer Gate’s high seclusion, beyond frost and snow,\nHe treads the snow, chanting verses with lingering thought.\nHis poetic spirit naturally rivals Bao and Xie;\nHis reclusive fame need not match Wang and Zhang alone.\nThe wild bridge’s chill shallows cradle his tattered hat;\nMountain trees, startled by wind, chase his misty satchel.\nStill he holds Meng Pavilion’s ancient intent—\nInk’s sparse glow reveals its faint trace.\n\n**A Recluse Presents a Stone**\n\nThe stone elder gladly moves the purple grotto’s clouds;\nThe recluse unties it from his brocade pouch.\nYin’s essence falls to earth, congealing spring rain;\nWater’s foam forms rosy clouds, gathering in daylight’s warmth.\nBy the rush-woven window, the wind’s length startles magpies;\nIn the ganoderma chamber, mist’s warmth dreams of stars parting.\nWhy should mountain folk boil it in the stream?\nA refined taste deeply knows to cleanse impurity’s haze.\n\n**Paper Curtains**\n\nSnow-white paper, borne in baskets, writes of silk’s glow;\nSquare curtains, stitched together, grace the cloud-like bed.\nSpring ice warms, stirring heaven and earth’s vastness;\nFrost moon’s radiance clears, lengthening the water clock’s drip.\nBeyond Mount Hua, dragons lie subdued;\nIn Zhuangzi’s garden, butterflies fly free.\nOriginally pure within and without,\nIts roots endure winter’s breath across the eight wilds.\n\n**Charcoal in the Brazier**\n\nStacked firewood’s flames rise to meet the sky,\nDefying frost and snow’s bitter cold for all to share.\nIts nature hardens through refining, not from blackness;\nIts striking sound rings clearer, its glow burns redder.\nWood and metal form images, revealing cinnabar’s hour;\nLi and Kan complete the celestial cycle, seizing creation’s craft.\nLet not the bellows weary of their task—\nHeaven’s mechanism flows through the six voids.\n\n**Inscribed on the *Scroll of Master Dongxuan***\n\nEarly I admired the mysterious void, studying nurturing life;\nLong I followed the celestial guard, dwelling in the divine capital.\nThe Great Void is but the primal chaos’ body;\nThe empty cavern holds the silent, soundless voice.\nClouds and qi often ride distant rosy pendants;\nPine shade ever guards the stone chamber’s purity.\nThe *Five Thousand Words’* meaning must be fused—\nSitting, I aid the imperial way to answer sagely brightness.\n\n**Visiting Master Lianyi, the Alchemist of Pengshan**\n\nLate elms rise high in the hall’s renewed construction;\nA lone bridge spans twin streams in autumn’s clarity.\nWild vines trail the fence, their fading flowers casting shadows;\nRound the door, forest pools echo the passing rain.\nThe orchard’s path winds through yellow-leafed lanes;\nThe ganoderma gatherer ages beneath white clouds.\nI have long planned to visit Pengshan’s master—\nFor now, I linger in his thatched hut, savoring each moment.\n\n**Inscribed on *Bai Chongyi’s Thatched Hut***\n\nAt the Imperial Academy, he transmitted the classics, favored by his lord;\nHis heart, like mountain valleys, delights in pure radiance.\nShort eaves birth white clouds, veiling the chamber;\nAn old garden congeals the cold, as bamboo screens the door.\nPins and pendants need not flee the palace gates;\nHills and gardens need not wait for the fisherman’s perch.\nThe forest of words truly holds a retiring spring—\nWould that its brilliance might shine upon my indolent robes.\n\n**Presented to Daoist Wang of Mount Mao**\n\nFor sixty springs you have dwelt in Huayang,\nYour jade tones and resonant chants heard as extraordinary.\nWhite clouds grace your courtyard, where orioles and flowers rest;\nRed leaves adorn the forest’s edge, where moon and dew part.\nWhy need cranes’ backs compose the sheng’s score?\nDragon’s light makes swords inscribe their patterns.\nSoon you must chant the empty echoes in the stone chamber—\nYang and Xu’s legacy dispels the world’s haze.\n\n**Inscribed on Mount Taihe**\n\nTaihe’s grandeur coalesces in towering peaks,\nWhere the Northern Culmen’s sacred winds command worship.\nEmerald cliffs warm the clouds, the cinnabar mortar steadfast;\nJade terraces, sparse trees—sword’s light surges.",

      "translated_text": "**By the Western Stream’s Plum Arbor**\n\nMoss-laced paths part beneath the plum arbor’s west,\nBanners beyond the heavens guard the Herb Palace.\nAt the palace gate, you bask in the sovereign’s grace—\nYour homeland afar, framed as if by a painter’s art.\n\n**Roaming Peach Blossom Spring**\n\nSpring’s end, the mountain peach’s path grows hard to trace,\nMoss carpets the steps, the old house lies deep in shade.\nCliffside cascades echo through the emerald ravine,\nStone gates twist beneath the shade of ancient vines.\nWithin the clouds, parrots and hounds dwell in the Thunder Chamber,\nAt the valley’s mouth, fields and orchards skirt Tiger Woods.\nOnce I lingered two nights in the cinnabar hall,\nVainly inquiring of past traces, idly chanting their rhyme.\n\n**Visiting a Friend at Fanxi Abbey**\n\nWhere hills and streams excel, dust’s clamor fades,\nThe path to Yingzhou leads to seek the hidden sage.\nBeyond the gate, wild boats glisten with leaping fish,\nBeneath pine shadows, the high pavilion cradles nesting cranes.\nAt dawn’s first light, I thread through blossoms to enter,\nIn clear skies, I watch yellow millet swept from the path.\nWere it not for an old friend’s enduring pure bond,\nWho would hear the lonely longings of my heart?\n\n**Inscribed on *Summer Mountains in Fanghu*, a Painting**\n\nYue’s most exquisite and lofty, its charm supreme,\nA spring-green stream, the boat yet moored.\nClouds link Fanghu’s peaks, summoning cranes,\nThe sky ends at Min and Emei, where turtles vanish.\nAn old house rests quietly in the village’s evening haze,\nDistant forests stretch, brushed by the rain’s sigh.\nRare now are Jiangnan’s surviving ink traces—\nI turn to recall Fang Gan, peerless in his age.\n\n**Paying Homage at the Temple of Marquis Liu**\n\nOnce among the feudal states, he held his fief,\nThe Yellow Stone’s three pacts bestowed their plain writ.\nHow could Han’s rift compare to the carriage’s return?\nThe Chu troops had already surrendered, their banners split.\nHe spoke of pardoning Yong Chi, no grudge held,\nPersuaded Han Xin to yield, the false king’s claim undone.\nLate descendants bask in his ancestral glory,\nEach time I pass the shrine, my heart trembles in awe.\n\n**Roaming the Thunder Altar**\n\nTigers crouch atop the crag, the stone altar soars,\nWind and thunder rise on all sides from the forest’s edge.\nFrom below, the red dust seems but a crucible of dust,\nThe sun wheels through the sky like a feathered chariot.\nFragrant trees cling to the cliffs, mist veils the path,\nJade halls and heavenly gates stand in piercing cold.\nSeated, I suddenly brandish the Azure Spirit’s sword,\nTreading rainbow mists, the cry of cranes and phoenixes rings.\n\n**Roaming Lingzhi Crag**\n\nParting the mist at dawn, I seek the tiger’s trail,\nLeaning on the cliff, the lone rock juts into the void.\nPurple lingzhi smokes in warmth, its sacred root endures,\nEmerald walls loom deep, the wild path stretches on.\nAncient trees, a thousand years, forget the kalpas’ turn,\nA few plum blossoms drift on the wind’s whim.\nIn the ravine’s mossy steps, traces remain—\nAcross ages, this pure journey was no mere chance.\n\n**Inscribed on the Pavilion of Lake Light and Mountain Hue**\n\nJiangdong’s lakes and mountains reign o’er a hundred prefectures,\nHere, a worthy governor’s virtue shines.\nThe official pavilion floats on waters wrapped in sky’s glow,\nLingzhi peaks rise in mist, bathed in moonlight.\nBlack canopies and new axes herald his governance,\nJade halls bear the legacy of his pure loyalty.\nOnce, spring sails were moored amid mist and rain—\nStill, I long to share this peerless vista with the clouds.\n\n**Inscribed on *Heaven’s Auspicious White Clouds at Sacred Well Mountain***\n\nOnce the Golden Immortal dwelt on Dragon-Spout Peak,\nTen thousand acres of white clouds like a sea’s waves.\nBy night, tigers grew still in the stone ravine,\nBy day, winds howled in the snow-laden hall.\nThe vast void’s breath—small as a snail’s horn,\nThe turbid world’s ten thousand things—light as goose down.\nThose who come from the west with gourd and bamboo hat to seek the Dao,\nWhose wondrous ink faintly transcends the world’s toil.\n\n**Inscribed on *Fanghu’s Rain-Bringing Bamboo***\n\nMaster Fanghu’s spirit roamed the boundless,\nHis lone surviving ink illuminates a thousand autumns.\nTigers crouch on stone, thunder shakes the earth,\nBamboo scatters rain, phoenixes alight on the mounds.\nSweet rains bring relief, turning back the kalpa’s end,\nSacred texts lie hidden on perilous peaks, in mystic isles.\nBy ancient pact, he soars beyond the ancients—\nStill, his dripping brush leaves jade-green trails.\n\n**Roaming the Divine Tortoise Kingdom of Nanfeng**\n\nDragons soar, phoenixes gather, shaping ridges and peaks,\nThe Jade Treasury’s divine legacy, the Crow’s Altar’s swift winds.\nEmerald cliffs and jagged peaks face the north,\nGreen Tortoise Ridge coils eastward in embrace.\nSpring conceals the forest valleys, the sky’s light pure,\nSleeves hide wind and thunder, the sword’s chill lingers.\nAshamed, I bear the jade casket as a true heir—\nGazing up, I seek the sacred traces, climbing once more.\n\n**At Huangtang Abbey, Replying to Fellow Travelers**\n\nUrging cranes through the woods, I cross the plank bridge,\nThe immortal maiden, her hair coiled in fragrant thatch.\nHeaven drapes the four wilds with twin-clouded clogs,\nEarth dampens the spring sky, rain half-fills the nests.\nGreen bamboo encircles the curtains, as if tigers lurk beyond,\nPurple caskets brim on perilous heights, chasing hidden dragons.\nWhose home claims the West Mountain’s finest?\nLend me a branch for my bundled journey.\n\n**Seeking a Retreat at Xianquan’s Mountain Haven**\n\nThe immortals’ secluded realm belongs to the Pure Capital—\nDare I choose these woods and hills as my destined home?\nMountain hues already share the dragon ravine’s emerald,\nThe spring’s voice awaits the crane-court’s missive.\nSu Men’s mighty whistle seems to echo near,\nJu Lou’s cinnabar sands are famed for nurturing emptiness.\nHeaven bestows white clouds—how dare I be clumsy?\nGladly I’ll follow gourd and bamboo hat, dwelling in humble wine.\n\n**Inscribed on *Mountain’s Radiance and Sea’s Moisture*, a Painting**\n\nThe illustrious house of Guanxi’s lineage endures,\nBy the stream’s pavilion, they dwell east of Chu.\nTen acres of spring clouds swathe the green silkworms,\nA courtyard of autumn waters mirrors emerald screens.\nThe recluse’s joy recalls Pan Yue,\nThe scrolls’ pure fragrance evokes Ma Rong.\nThe painted scene seems to capture the farthest seas and peaks—\nStill, I seek the ancestral legacy, embracing its flowing grace.\n\n**Autumn Feast at the Foundry**\n\nThe sagely sovereign unfurls his chart, halting the six dragons,\nThe Foundry City’s mountains and peaks coil in grandeur.\nCrane pavilions stand twin in the misty glow,\nPhoenix paths part the cypress and parasol winds.\nFrost-laden jade trees brush sleeves with green,\nNewly poured jade cups glow on crimson faces.\nDrunken verses draw near the immortals’ realm—\nTogether we revere the rare favor of feasting in the Herb Palace.\n\n**Longing for Xianquan**\n\nA lone peak coils with stone, a record of quiet sway,\nWind and dust’s steps—dreams never stray.\nClearing the wilds, a thatched eave faces the evening marsh,\nHoeing the misty stone steps, they charm the cold glow.\nHalf the grove’s flowered rain thins in spring’s shade,\nA ravine’s lingzhi clouds dim the Dao’s trace.\nHow many days till autumn skies turn yellow?\nStill, I suspect the clear night finds me seated on the mossy isle.\n\n**To the Daoist Recorder of Toxic Affairs**\n\nJoyfully I watch the cyclical years complete their round,\nNurturing the true self, fittingly lingering in the capital.\nPeach blossoms ripen before spring, mist drapes the robe,\nWinter solstice’s plum blooms, dew fills the cup.\nIn the grand court, pure inquiries surpass Yan Si,\nIn the inner canon, profound discourse excels Chuqiu.\nOur recent parting swiftly becomes a cloud’s divide—\nI can only pray for your longevity of eight thousand autumns.\n\n**Gazing at Lingzhi Clouds by the Spring**\n\nWhite clouds have long nested in the valley,\nLoving the mountain spring’s likeness to nurturing obscurity.\nHeaven narrows the door and courtyard, barely a canopy’s bow,\nEarth divides the luminous peaks, small as a drawn bow.\nGood fields border the wilds, like Zhuge’s,\nFine mushrooms rise in rows, after Lu Tong’s.\nBeside the clouds, purple lingzhi may be eaten—\nNo need to seek the solitary phoenix in the mortal world.",

      "translated_text": "**Banquet in the Snow with Daoist Master Miao**\n\nIn Xuan Du’s brocade hall, a feast in the Western Pure,\nDaylong snow swirls, auspicious hues gleam bright.\nImmortal wine, warmed, turns clouds to emerald green,\nCave plums bloom before year’s end, jade petals drift in mist.\n\nKeen winds part the frost at the phoenix-crested gate,\nVisiting bamboo, crane-adorned rails line the hall.\nAshamed, my rustic steps intrude this noble gathering—\nMay distant years bring you boundless honor and grace.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribing the Painting *Autumn Wind over Fang the True Man’s Thatched Hut***\n\nWhose house stands by the boulder-lined fishing cove?\nLight ink plays on the tranquil grove’s canvas.\nThe numinous zither’s damp notes summon distant cranes,\nPetal shade slows our steps, sharing gulls’ ease.\n\nAutumn wind ages the hut—Yang Xiong’s old abode,\nFlowing water hums at the gate—Xie Tiao’s mountain.\nWhere my virtue pales ‘mid bamboo’s chill and river’s jade,\nGazing at the scroll, my dreams take flight once more.\n\n---\n\n**On the Fourth Day of the First Month, Receiving the Edict to Return to the Mountains: Parting from Immortal Attendant Fu**\n\nFor months, awe weighed on me in the bamboo palace,\nNow the Emperor’s grace, profound, bids me return.\nThe Dipper’s rays weave through rosy clouds,\nThe Kunpeng’s head bears moonlit dew.\n\nClearing snow bridges the spring-crossing rain,\nWarm clouds trail the evening tide’s breeze.\nRaising my cup, parting sorrow deepens—\nMay crane-longevity and tortoise-years be ours to share.\n\n---\n\n**Parting from Daoist Master Zi**\n\nSnow clears as we meet, laughing in our jade carriage,\nJade terrace’s spring rivals the hall’s splendor.\nQinhuai’s waters swell with the spring tide,\nWu trees’ mist fades in sparse night rain.\n\nThe immortal bureau’s purple sable trails cloud-steps,\nRiver sails and black caps blur in misty huts.\nHalf a year’s parting divides us from forest and spring—\nI’ll refine the elixir, seeking the brocade-cliff texts.\n\n---\n\n**Winter Days in Mountain Retreat**\n\nWarm sun bathes the day in radiant glow,\nEmpty hills, pond’s edge—carved doors stay shut.\nWhite clouds, cushioned, share the woodcutter’s path,\nPurple cave’s folk return, dogs guarding their way.\n\nSnow tea’s froth surges, then the spring runs thin,\nPine-brewed dew-wine—few guests now remain.\nLeisure stirs me to hasten the plum’s bloom,\nSoon the valley will be all emerald hues.\n\n---\n\n**Composing at Mountain Retreat on the Third Day of the Third Month**\n\nIn the world, I shame my fleeting traces,\nYet in the mountains, days pass in pine-wind ease.\nDragon well’s water swells, clouds steam the mist,\nForests bow like whale waves, veiling the sky.\n\nPool’s algae sways, hooks part the near green,\nCliff flowers cling to clogs, treading fading red.\nFleeting glory—why vie for gourds’ tether?\nWine in hand, joy transcends the mortal realm.\n\n---\n\n**Winter’s Clear Day: Seeking the Former Site of Hunlun Hermitage**\n\nStaff in hand, I wander the valley’s depths,\nSilent, the pipa stream’s path runs deep.\nFields and plains stretch, winding and secluded,\nGrass and brambles mark the ruins’ rugged trace.\n\nSun-warmed slopes melt frost on the path,\nWind-swept steps chill the tiger-haunted grove.\nWho grasps Hunlun’s ancient intent?\nOnly pines and wutong keep the years’ heart.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribing the Painting *Fanghu’s Return to the Hut***\n\nFanghu’s brush blurs the vast and hazy,\nMirage-like, the linked huts share the ore’s fate.\nBeyond form and qi, the cosmos is seen,\nGreat vistas of rivers and peaks dwell in being and non-being.\n\nFrosted forests, leopard mists—autumn’s voice lingers,\nMisty isles, dragon pools—sea hues merge.\nWhere to seek the Jiang and Han?\nUnashamed, the secluded valley cradles Fang Peng’s rest.\n\n---\n\n**Gazing After Emperor Yu at the Former Sites of Jinye Hermitage and Tianrui Hermitage**\n\nGolden immortals’ wondrous structures tread Kunlun,\nTianrui once glimpsed the *Yu gong*’s texts.\nMountain breath melts spring, scattering mist,\nHeaven’s light lingers in snow, casting day’s shade.\n\nSwords fly from Liaomei, dust stirs in the kalpa,\nCinnabar guards the abyss, dragons stand peerless.\nThrough the ages, pavilions blend with wind and moon—\nWho now hears the Dao in a single draught of the sacred spring?\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Xian Spring in the Snow**\n\nMountains heaped with snow flank the stream’s edge,\nMy staff seeks the old path, untrodden by men.\nJade trees’ broken boughs sprawl on the earth,\nThe Milky Way’s floating silk threads the frozen rite.\n\nWind topples nest-cranes, clouds darken early,\nIce scatters cliff-pines, the valley stirs with spring.\nIn the lofty pavilion’s bitter cold, high repose—\nWhy seek the mortal world’s phosphorescent isles?\n\n---\n\n**Hermitage**\n\nLong have I cherished reclusion’s joy,\nFleeting fame—now and then, a mere whisper.\nIn motion, I watch wind and clouds seal the pass,\nIn stillness, I peer at heaven and earth from my lotus hut.\n\nI’d summon Bao Jing’s pair of swallows,\nWeary of chasing Wang Qiao’s twin suns.\nEver grasping the great vision beyond form and qi,\nThe silent true master reveals the dark pearl.\n\n---\n\n**Inscribing the Hall of Mystic Contemplation**\n\nThe eastern ravine’s high hall opens another realm,\nCleansed of dust and grime, it savors the profound.\nIn the yellow center, observing wonders, I know emptiness’s peak,\nIn white’s embrace, dwelling in integrity, I grasp the primal image.\n\nNesting cranes ride the wind, flutes echo the moon,\nStream gulls skim snow, oars part the spring.\nThe venerable master, once a guest at the Golden Gate,\nEarly inherits his family’s legacy, joining the immortals’ ranks.\n\n---\n\n**Night Lodging at the Abbey of the Mystic Capital**\n\nTwenty years’ dusty traces—now I return,\nThe immortal terrace’s marble steles mourn the kalpa’s ashes.\nDistant cranes at night’s end first warn of dew,\nAbyssal fish in spring’s warmth already startle at thunder.\n\nThe stream’s voice remains the peach-blossom waters,\nMoonlight still invades the bamboo-leaf cup.\nUnworthy heir to the ancestral legacy,\nI grieve the rise and fall of wormwood and weeds.\n\n---\n\n**Morning in Flowers: Lodging at the Eastern Peak Palace**\n\nThe Eastern Peak’s temple, the Wood Emperor’s shrine,\nOn this fine day, I ascend in spring’s warmth.\nFlowers brighten the mountain county, plains and streams fair,\nThe divine precinct’s armor and helmets stand mighty.\n\nThe Silver Maiden’s shrine laments filial devotion,\nThe Azure Crow’s tomb marks enduring merit.\nMay auspicious omens, age after age, govern the realm—\nI watch the fleeting light in the moonlit night.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Stone Immortal Abbey**\n\nDeep into the peach-blossom spring, a hundred acres bloom,\nCinnabar cliffs and jade walls bear dragon veins.\nForms return to the imageless, not gold nor stone,\nThe land’s numinous essence crowns the misty clouds.\n\nSlanted Dipper’s light joins the cinnabar cavern’s fire,\nCrossed boughs’ dampness guards the moss’s patterns.\nDelighted to share the carriage’s canopy in true appreciation,\nTogether we cleanse the dust’s grime in the immortal’s home.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting the Wondrous Spirit Abbey on Turtle Hill by the River**\n\nThe immortal terrace coils, overlooking the river’s flow,\nThe winding path’s secluded source welcomes my return.\nDeparted cranes trace the Milky Way’s route,\nThe sacred turtle still dwells on Fenglin Isle.\n\nFive Cities shift the kalpa, cinnabar light stirs,\nThree Isles blend spring, jade qi surrenders.\nHenceforth, the mystic terrace’s splendor grows—\nLofty winds, generation to generation, spread the true Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Mount Magu**\n\nWind-swept steps ascend, a hundred turns distant,\nThe perilous pavilion embraces the earth, soaring far.\nLeaning on emptiness, the silver river’s waterfall cascades,\nFlanking the path, secluded bamboos drift in emerald mist.\n\nThe dusty realm fades into hillocks,\nThe immortal capital’s ethereal vastness dawns bright.\nTwenty years of travels—all forgotten—\nWhy seek the true in the vast and empty?\n\n---\n\n**The Celestial Maiden of Gushe Descends to the Five Cities**\n\nThe Jade Altar’s winding path ascends into the azure void.",

aligned with the heavens, awaiting Cai Jing.\nJade pendants linger where dragon-wells hold snow,\nPavilion beams gleam where Magpie Bridge’s stars sway.\n\nHer steadfast virtue, though erased through a thousand years, still illumines her fragrant steps,\nThis land of numinous splendor fittingly shelters the hundred spirits.\n\n**Roaming the Crimson Clouds Grotto-Heaven**\n\nAn empty cavern conceals the Lesser You in its depths,\nOld wanderings and relics stir memories of passing years.\nThe mountain winds along the raven’s path, coiling through cloud-wreathed steps,\nA dragon’s embrace cradles the spring, cascading over stone.\n\nMoss-clad steles stand in fading sunlight,\nSparse woods and carved pavilions overlook the chill mist.\nI linger, half-expecting a cloud-feeder’s wild joy,\nYet no jade flute’s notes reach my seat.\n\n**Gazing at Mount Lu’s Snow from a Boat**\n\nOn the river islet, a skiff basks in abundant moonlight—\nMount Lu’s spring-cleared peaks rise jagged and grand.\nWithin Incense Burner Peak, clouds blanket a thousand acres,\nAt Starlet Bay’s head, snow drifts across slopes.\n\nThe wind hushes Tiger Stream’s pure rapids,\nClouds veil the Dragon Chamber as night tides pass.\nThe white of settled nests blurs with lofty summits,\nCarved by spring’s voice to brew stone hollows.\n\n**Offering the Jiao Ritual at the Upper Clarity Palace on the Lantern Festival, Delighted by Clear Skies**\n\nRain drenched the verdant spring, veiling the sacred rite,\nThen suddenly the Lantern Festival’s moon shone full again.\nCrane Mountain’s spring fills Kongtong’s feast,\nThe Celestial Pole’s winds clear the azure heavens’ banquet.\n\nLotus blooms stream radiance like golden balls,\nHeavenly flowers scatter hues like jade maidens.\nRejoicing in the

speak of your noble house’s imperial favor,\nJade towers now stand even more resplendent and pure.\nFrom afar, I hear the grotto’s ritual hymns entwined with rosy clouds,\nStill imagining the immortal terrace’s brocade-laden feast.\n\nJewel trees by your pillow glow with flickering light,\nJade peaks at your window weave graceful lines.\nGe Hong sips cinnabar-infused water,\nWhile the useless tree finds joy in long years.\n\n**Matching Rhymes with Instructor Shen**\n\nThe Jade Capital’s terraces bloom with peach blossoms,\nThe Heavenly Capital’s steps are trod without weariness.\nFrom the Dragon Pool, we ladle clouds’ hues,\nThe Rabbit’s brush pales beside the moon’s ink.\n\nYour poetic spirit rivals Shen Yue’s,\nYour transcendence evokes Qin Gao’s zither.\nWhen will we meet again, white-haired and parted?\nBrewing the elixir’s waters, we revel in eternal joy.\n\n**To Daoist Recorder Cao**\n\nAncestral blessings endure, revered through past and present,\nYet my fragmented talent

passions roam.\nFortunate to have a trusted friend on the path,\nIn retreat, I long for your kind words.\n\n**Visiting the Yanfa Abbey on a Fine Day**\n\nThe abbey’s pavilions pierce the heavens, jade qi afloat,\nLeaning on clouds, they lodge beside the ancient cinnabar mounds.\nFrost-chilled bells traverse pine and mist beneath the moon,\nFireflies and crickets trace the autumn’s stone ravine.\n\nUnsurprised that no Wei Bao sweeps my gate,\nMost joyful to craft lines like Yang Xiu’s.\nA small cup before the lamp deepens our bond,\nAt dawn, I linger longer at Lingyan’s peaks.\n\n**Ascending Mount Wanshou**\n\nBeyond sheer cliffs, layered peaks emerge from rain and mist,\nWinding cloud-steps lead toward the azure vault.\nThe Flowery Source’s hidden ford swells with silver waves,\nCliffside waterfalls hang like mighty white silk.\n\nAt heaven’s edge, cranes’ nests beckon Xu Mai,\nAmid perilous heights, I seek Maosong’s alchemical treasures.\nPassing the courtyard, I hear of wind and thunder’s charge—\nBest to apply wondrous skill upon the lofty summit.\n\n**The Beaded Curtain Pavilion**\n\nA beaded curtain hangs in the small pavilion’s spaciousness,\nNight merges with clouds, lodging at the eaves.\nForests hold layered mists, startling as a prowling leopard,\nGullies rush with winds, poised to descend like simurghs.\n\nOrchid curtains glow, dispelling the day’s warmth,\nLanterns’ oil murmurs, hastening spring’s chill.\nIdly they speak of Xu Fu gazing toward Penglai’s isles—\nWhy seek jade terraces for feathered wings?\n\n**Inscribed on Xiao Shi’s Phoenix Terrace**\n\nA perilous terrace soars a hundred feet, crowning the layered heavens,\nA rainbow phoenix wheels through the sky, jade pipes attuned.\nXiao Shi’s love was no mortal match,\nNongyu’s immortal nature truly bore heaven’s mark.\n\nFive-cloud towers and pavilions merge with rosy clouds,\nThree Isles’ banners drift through mist and dew.\nThe secret archives offer ample leisure for pure delight—\nAutumn’s skies beckon lingering echoes to be summoned.\n\n**Inscribed on the Flying Immortal**\n\nThe immortal’s traces fade, yet the painted hues remain vivid,\nFloating clouds and empty caverns dissolve into the azure void.\nJade maidens’ pendants flutter where peaches ripen,\nGolden mothers pause where bamboo dew gleams.\n\nA light boat bears inscriptions, troubling the crow messenger,\nA fragrant seal holds no words, crossing the simurgh’s plow.\nThe immortal’s roots find harmony in rosy clouds,\nAwaiting the legacy of Fang and Cai at the descending court.\n\n**Inscribed on the *Clouds Rising from the Mountain’s Waist* by Fanghu**\n\nThe immortal Fanghu’s wondrous ink surpasses Shangyan’s,\nEndlessly weaving long forests, ever enraptured.\nClouds break from the mountain’s belly, congealing in dawn’s indigo,\nNew waters swell at the ravine’s head, steaming in crystalline haze.\n\nSoaring, one seems to hear simurghs’ cries,\nSweeping the path, only dusters’ whispers remain.\nYet rejoice—immortal courts teem with officials,\nGazing outward, emerald hues cling to spring robes.\n\n**Inscribed on the *Gazing at the Sea* Painting**\n\nA boundless expanse of blue-green waves stretches wide,\nHeaven and earth are but a horse—who discerns their bounds?\nMountains invite broad contemplation, revealing clarity,\nCourtly plans suffice to secure peace.\n\nRain clears, island barbarians float across the eight poles,\nThe moon rises, misty trees link to the Three Hans.\nHigh sentiments are not exhausted by mere paintings—\nI laugh and cast my fishing line toward the giant turtle.\n\n**Inscribed on the *Three Gorges* Painting**\n\nA renowned stronghold guards the long Yangtze,\nThe brocade waters flow west, their course vast and distant.\nThe heavenly moat’s legacy evokes Du and Ge,\nThe people’s enduring customs praise Gong and Huang.\n\nWu Gorge’s beauty mirrors the rope bridge’s distance,\nWitch Gorge’s clouds stretch to Sword Pavilion’s length.\nWhen shall we pledge to gaze upon ancestral blessings,\nSeeking autumn’s fragrance where flowers are washed?\n\n**The Grand Plough**\n\nThe great unity governs the four seas in spring,\nAt the southern suburb, the emperor’s rites are solemn and sincere.\nStellar avenues bear golden tally-staffs,\nHeavenly gates welcome jade chariots.\n\nJade tablets and bi disks gleam with rosy clouds, honoring Zhou’s classics,\nPendants and seals embrace clouds, renewing Han’s rites.\nAlone, I feel shame in my dark robes as I present offerings—\nThe sage’s virtue and auspicious omens revere the One.\n\n**Ascending Great Mao Peak**\n\nJuqu’s perilous peak crowns the nine heavens,\nAt dawn, I part rosy clouds to ascend at daybreak.\nBelow, the vast earth’s banners of mist draw near,\nAbove, the vaulted sky’s canopy of haze gathers.\n\nAlready I embrace Mao’s staff, arriving by feathered carriage,\nStill I await Wang and Xu to welcome the numinous tally.\nRejoicing in the new structure soaring into the void,\nFrom here, the true Dao’s winds will spread for a hundred generations.\n\n**Second Mao Peak**\n\nThe Dark Continent’s small hollow winds in coils,\nAmong clustered peaks, the supreme abode stands as the imperial seat.\nEightfold numinous texts mark the jade registers,\nFivefold wondrous traces adorn the jade books.\n\nDew

      "translated_text": "**Inscription on the *Pine Shade Imparting the Dao* Painting**\n\nAt Wei Ridge, the immortal builds his hut east of the jasper grove,\nThe cloud-nesting Daoist paints a hundred-foot pine.\nBefore the Hall of Seeing Mountains, its shade spreads like a lofty canopy,\nRoots coil round ironstone, branches coil like dragons.\nHe claims the ancient immortal of Mud-Pellet Peak\nOnce sought the Dao on Jasper Mountain.\nLike the sacred altar where swallows peck white stone,\nLong vines and autumn reeds hum with the wind.\nAbove, it grazes the Nine Heavens’ scattered Silver River,\nBelow, it links the Three Mountains’ distant starry rainbow.\nThe Dao of Mud-Pellet Peak surveys boundless kalpas,\nPeerless in verdant grandeur, gazing into primordial chaos.\n\nLong ago, the immortal rode a crane over the ridge,\nPlaying his flute across Min Sea to visit famed peaks.\nMy old friend, honored as a father,\nReturns like a gull to Plum Blossom Pavilion by the creek.\nJia Ding’s mighty words tempered like steel,\nHis tender whispers deep as Dongfang Shuo’s wit.\nThe literary splendor of Daoist mountains—how desolate!\nWith wings outspread, he soars beyond whale’s horn.\n\nI recall mooring my boat by the stream,\nCoarse wine beneath pine shade, the creek moon full.\nScales of fish dart through empty green,\nZither notes drift through twilight mist.\nTowering trees and sparse bamboos defy depiction,\nStroking the present, mourning the past, my heart drifts.\nBi Hong and Wei Yan were called unmatched,\nYet only the Gourd Immortal’s brush nears their fragrance.\nCloud-descendants should strive to inherit this fame,\nAmid turquoise waters and forest peaks in evening’s chill.\nThis frost-enduring timber, fit for beams and pillars,\nRarely chosen from shadowed cliffs and snowy crags.\nLaughing, I sing amid orchid and thoroughwort,\nLonging to pluck pine blossoms to brew spring’s nectar.\nRaising my head, I summon the two old immortals, Chen and Bai,\nDrunk beyond the clouds, playing with autumn’s hues.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription on the *Celestial Palm of Mount Hua* Painting**\n\nGreat Hua Peak, anciently named the Sacred Mountain,\nIts primordial darkness and earthly might shape solid stone.\nRoots thrust west to towering Song and Tai,\nTen-thousand-zhang blue cliffs lean into the void.\nSlanted like a half-moon, its palm gleams bright,\nHanging the Silver River from the azure sky.\nTouching the heavens, its snowy ridges stretch like a screen,\nPiled high, the clustered peaks rival Liang and Huo.\nThe Son of Heaven’s tours have graced it many times,\nAncient shrines and halls stand a thousand *xun* tall.\nBroken bridges stretch to quiet islets,\nOld trees bow low over deep streams.\nFloating clouds seem to veil evening’s bells and drums,\nIron chains hang high through misty haze.\n\nHere dwells the immortal Wang Ziqiao,\nTigers and leopards guard his stone door.\nIn our dynasty’s prosperous reign, rites are grand,\nWe dispatch feathered messengers to convey sincerity.\nThe jade altar’s ascent is too sacred to attempt,\nReturning, I hasten to the Golden Gate to report to the throne.\nHis mighty words and wondrous carvings illuminate the ages,\nQin and Han vainly boast of Feng and Shan.\nMountain spirits and river lords descend with auspicious signs,\nThe ancestral altars stand firm, the celestial realm secure.\nThe Giant Spirit split stone to channel the river,\nBright stars and Jade Maidens dwell on cinnabar mounds.\nThe Yellow River’s whirlpools rise from the sky’s edge,\nThe White Emperor’s golden essence glows all around.\nThe carriage’s axle and arrow’s shaft pave the path to heaven,\nI long to follow it and speak with the gods.\nI would summon Ma and Wei to ride deer aloft,\nBut where are the verdant cliffs and cinnabar valleys?\nStaff in hand, I laugh and clap Hong Ya’s shoulder,\nHungry, I feast on fallen geese and rosy clouds,\nThirsty, I drink from the Jade Well’s lotus.\nIf I meet one with purple robes and crimson temples,\nI’ll borrow his tea-dragon to soar and return.\nThe Gourd Immortal, white-haired, marvels at the painting’s perfection,\nHow could Nie’s and Shu’s traces ever fade?\nA single breath of cool wind spans ninety thousand leagues—\nWhy need I get drunk beneath Emei’s moon?\n\n---\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\n**On the *Immortal’s Intent of Square Gourd* Painting**\nWeary of rouge and powder marring autumn’s face,\nI wash the wind’s dust from one or two peaks.\nTo know the immortals’ flavorless realm,\nCast off worldly grime and sit beneath the pines.\n\n**The Withered Tree of the True Man of the Western Realm**\nEvening sun at the ferry, water merges with sky,\nFallen leaves, cold crows on the ancient road.\nMy brush races with autumn’s endless sounds—\nWhere does the fishing rod stand in the western wind?\n\n**Secluded Dwelling in Cloudy Gorges**\nEmerald cliffs, cinnabar gorges, clouds over a thousand acres,\nA small thatched hut barely contains the seclusion.\nI hear that by the sunny window where books are spread,\nWisteria flowers and autumn wind bring flying rain.\n\n**Bamboo Leaves of Square Gourd’s Immortal Crag**\nReturning by wild boat, sated with wonders,\nIn my sleeve, a green jade memento of that time.\nImmortal dwellings often lie in azure emptiness—\nThey show the world only half a branch.\n\n**Gazing at Immortals Pavilion**\nImmortals tread the earth, following sacred traces,\nGazing back at simurghs and phoenixes through layered peaks.\nDo not say the numinous terrace is untraceable—\nHere in Jiangnan stands the highest summit.\n\n**Refining Cinnabar Cliff**\nMercury and lead refined into golden sand,\nMoss-covered cliffs and shoulders become home.\nGazing afar at the white clouds’ window,\nI still long for the Great Return’s immortal sprouts.\n\n**Cloudy Grotto**\nHollowed stone grottoes where clouds and mist drift,\nSacred herbs and black mushrooms—how many years old?\nSitting, I listen to wind and thunder rise beneath my feet,\nSuspecting beyond this, there is no heaven.\n\n**Dragon Pool**\nA sheer torrent embraces the rocky shore,\nA pool of cold green guards its mossy robe.\nThe coiled dragon lurks deep in the mountain’s foot,\nOnce it rode cloud-glue to return as rain.\n\n**Scholar’s Pavilion**\nThis splendid hall once birthed jade-hall immortals,\nIts literary brilliance and radiance illuminate the purple mystery.\nScattered among mortals like countless pearls,\nThe soaring whale’s legacy stirs a thousand years.\n\n**Star-Worshipping Altar**\nStanding tall on the first peak of empty azure,\nWith flying steps, I mount the wind.\nTouching the summit, I forget heaven’s vastness,\nPointing and gesturing amid the night’s vital breath.\n\n**Jade Court Lodge**\nTen-thousand-*ren* cinnabar light illuminates the pearl,\nIn the open court, I sit serenely like a jade lotus.\nMortals vainly worship the realm of luminous clarity—\nSimurghs and cranes wheel in the sky, listening to the *Step Void*.\n\n**Star-Plucking Pavilion**\nA lofty pavilion crowns the emerald haze,\nStars are plucked, clad only in five-zhu robes.\nWashing the void, the silver desert leaves no autumn trace,\nAt night, jade pipes and cranes return aloft.\n\n**Gazing at the Numinous Mountain**\nJade-carved hibiscus gleams in the gaze,\nCrystal sprouts grow, all imbued with immortal spirit.\nWhen shall I learn to shear Wu Song’s waters,\nAnd cut a single green leaf from Lotus Peak?\n\n**Osmanthus in the Moon**\nGolden grains’ autumn fragrance at the moon’s half-branch,\nGladly sharing its pure shadow in the melting ice.\nIf this body dwelt in the realm of pure emptiness,\nNo need to wait for cloud-coiffed magpies to cross the bridge.\n\n**Cloud Wilderness Painting**\nGazing afar at the world’s toil on the vast desert’s edge,\nMidair, the sound of cranes and pipes drifts in stillness.\nOnce I grasped the stringless intent,\nNot only pine nests—all is white clouds.\n\n**Chess Peak**\nFortunate to tread the high cliff, meeting Spring Peak,\nStone altars and clouds veil east and west.\nImmortal chess differs from Shang Mountain’s game—\nAll lies within the River Chart’s doubled numbers.",

heaven, illumined earth—\nOne day, the ancient circle fused,\nWisdom and folly both transcended.\nWorldly ties now severed,\nBehold the jade-green pool’s mirror,\nThe moon-polished pearl of the heart.\n\nThe eight wastes shine boundless, no corner hid,\nThrough endless night, the ice-jade nectar melts.\nTrue lead meets mercury, Kan and Li unite,\nFire-dragon and water-tiger, the white key

Fields.\nWhere its function unleashes killing force,\nThunder and lightning shake the boundless.\n\nNeither mind, nor dharma,\nNor even Chan—\nSubtle, wondrous, profound,\nA thousand gold coins would

tightens,\nYet plum blossoms thrive, and the muse of poetry stirs.\n\nA thousand classics, ten thousand histories suffice for governance,\nYet my scholarly ambition grows ever more vast.\nI question the Heavenly Root and Moon Grotto,\nPondering the affairs of ancient and modern literature—\nHow many have lost their way at the ford?\nGather in the luminous clarity of the empty spirit,\nAnd wherever you lean on your blossom staff, spring follows.\nFree of vulgar thoughts—\nContemplate and investigate.\n\n**Contemplating the Mundane**\nBeneath Misty Lake Peak,\nI wove a nest of pines and

comes—\nSpring winds and autumn moons,\nPines and chrysanthemums keep me company in quiet murmurs.\n\nWith bowl and gourd, I live as fate allows,\nNo glory, no shame,\nAlong woodcutter’s paths and fisherman’s bays.\nWith forest apes and valley crows,\nI share evening’s joy and morning’s delight.\nSweeping away the dust of passion and karmic grime,\nI don my robe, sit in true breath,\nNurturing the returning elixir.\nIn leisurely ease,\nA lone zither, a single crane—\nFrost and dew leave no mark on my face.\n\n**Lyric to \"Su Wu the Slow\" · Leisure’s Dissolution**\nAwakening to illusion, seeking truth,\nI vowed for years to transcend birth and death.\nThrough wind-sifted snow, I compiled texts,\nReading by night, chanting by day,\nProbing the wisdom of sages past and present.\nDao’s mystery, Chan’s lineage—\nTen thousand differences, one root.\nTo discern what lies beyond scrutiny,\nThis boundless, unobstructed true emptiness,\nNot even the moon’s waxing and waning affects it.\n\nHow laughable—\nA bamboo chair, a thin meditation mat,\nA pine-framed window, an osmanthus casement,\nEach step a stride toward loftiness.\nYet the world’s dust I shun,\nWater and clouds my companions,\nReclining in my old garden amid wind and snow.\nFine steeds and sable robes,\nJade sleeves and rouge shells—\nAll fleeting splendor, idle talk.\nTurn swiftly—here is the shore,\nCurtains part to reveal light,\nThe moon of the mind, the heaven of nature.\n\n**Lyric to \"All Crimson\" · Worldly Observations**\nI recall my youth,\nWhere once I sought pleasure—\nAll now changed, no trace remains.\nI listen to the sea’s swelling tide,\nThe brocade of waves receding,\nThe four cities’ eternal spring.\nAt the song-and-dance tower, I loathed the setting sun,\nAmid pipes and strings, I raged at drunken oblivion.\nBehold the present—\nHow many moments of glory and withering?\nSorrow defies order.\n\nDream’s phantoms wake,\nWorldly cares disperse—\nVain sighs, empty warnings.\nI lament the orchid oar, the reed pavilion,\nThe cold water’s misty tinkling.\nNo share in rivers and lakes’s frayed ends,\nYet heaven’s heart-moon casts its reflection in the limpid pool.\nReflecting on this floating life,\nI see through joy and sorrow—\nThe river’s waves grow still.\n\n**Lyric to \"Drunken River Moon\" · Rivers and Lakes**\nOnce I followed a fishing skiff,\nPlayed with autumn’s waves,\nWitnessing rivers and lakes’ vast expanse.\nBeyond the two shores’ white caltrop isles,\nDew glistened on reeds, maple leaves fell.\nMidnight’s tide roared,\nMidheaven’s moon shone,\nThe plum-blossom horn turned again.\nPushing open the hatch, I asked—\nWhere were my old friends? Everywhere, desolation.\n\nI launched the oars at Shepherd’s Shore, the fishing village,\nBy the city’s edge at dusk,\nReturning crows cried in flocks.\nGreen wine, yellow blossoms,\nAmid mist and rain—\nHow many dreams of my old garden’s groves and vales?\nThe crumbling pagoda’s wind howled,\nSea gates and mountains shrank,\nSpring’s end, willows draped the outer walls.\nReturning to the grove,\nI shook my robes, gazed loftily at the boundless.\n\n**Lyric to \"Gazing at Plum Blossoms\" · Illusory Bonds**\nThis floating world knows no bounds,\nIts dusty burdens seen through—\nHow long can illusion last?\nThrough kalpas of enmity and kinship,\nLifetimes of acquaintance,\nThin as a wisp of cloud, this affection.\nIn vain I boast of cunning schemes,\nParading heroism—\nOnly adding to karmic shadows.",
