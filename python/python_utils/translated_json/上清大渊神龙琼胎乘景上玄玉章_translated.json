From the Wen River, I attended him, along with the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the assembled host of dragon masters and river lords, convening in the Lower Prime to deliberate on the promotion of the world’s great talents. These were to be appointed to the offices of Dan Yuan, the Imperial Ultimate, the Square Cauldrons, and the Caverns of Mystery, where they would unlock the numinous treasures of the Great Cavern and the Supreme Clarity, bestowing the highest scriptures upon the most devoted disciples. I shall now entrust you with the Dragon Pearl, divine elixirs, and the *Jade Chapters of Ascending Radiance from the Great Abyss*.\"\n\nDan Yuan requested further details, and the Perfected replied: \"I first received the essential Dao of the Supreme Overseer of All Perfected, and later, the Jade Maiden of the Supreme Clarity’s Upper Mystery bestowed upon me the Pearl of the Divine Dragon, along with the talisman of the Supreme Clarity’s Divine Mother’s wondrous *qi*. Adorning the pearl refines the jade embryo, awakening the dragon’s inherent virtue; wearing the talisman compels the water officials to prostrate and the river courses to obey. Such are the profound mysteries of the Dao—enabling one to ascend in broad daylight upon attaining perfection.\n\nWhen I achieved transcendence, my jade womb split open, and a divine dragon bore my form. Now, I ascend and descend through the Supreme Clarity, presiding over the abyssal dwelling. The divine dragon coils and undulates, its silver radiance gleaming with luminous purity. It transforms into a serpent, which I once stored in a gilded jade bowl, entrusted to a handmaiden. On the full moon of Mid-Autumn, when the dragon fixes its gaze and directs its intent, the interplay of light and mist causes it to disgorge a pearl the size of a pellet. I refine this with fire into powdered pearls, bestowing them upon those of pure bone and ageless spirit.\n\nThis year, I obtained one such pearl and divided it into forty-nine. I consumed one, and the remaining forty-eight I now confer upon you.\" Thereupon, a jade-green flask produced the pearls, gilded and varying in size. \"If these are used, the pearls within the *Jade Chapters* need not be employed. Should mortals receive the scripture without my presence, they must use the pearls from the *Jade Chapters*.\" Dan Yuan bowed twice and accepted them.\n\nThe Perfected continued: \"Your name has long been recorded among the elect. You shall transmit the scripture with solemn vows, using a pair of golden fish wrapped in azure-patterned silk. You must carry these yourself.\" Dan Yuan fashioned a pair of spirit-belly fish from yellow gold, each five and a half inches long, threading their heads and tails with blue silk and affixing gilded tassels. He presented forty-nine feet of azure-water-patterned silk, along with the ritual pledge, to his master, the Perfected of Wen River. Thereby, he received the *Jade Chapters of the Divine Dragon’s Jade Embryo Ascending Radiance from the Great Abyss*, the *Celestial Ascending Dragon’s Mystic Treasure Text of the Supreme Clarity’s Spontaneous Wondrous Qi*, and the paired talismans of the Azure Valley—written in cinnabar and vermilion.\n\nOne talisman was left blank in its center, for the Dragon Lord to claim; it was not to be given to others. Instead, he was granted a divine golden chariot of the Supreme Clarity, exchanged through a matching tally. He further entreated the Lord of the Purple Numinous Jade Prime, who cleaved the deep jade grottoes of the Jade Capital, where suspended jade naturally secreted fluid, forming pearls. The seven luminaries converged, and the hundred treasures ascended as vessels. Embracing the ninefold-refined radiant pearl of the Yang Cavern, he concocted golden nectar, crafting amber pellets divided into thirty-six pearls.\n\nHe swore an oath before the Nine Perfected and Twenty-Four August Celestial Venerables of the Supreme Clarity, vowing to initiate the Sixteen Left Perfected and Twenty Female Perfected of the Supreme Clarity. The foremost of the Left Perfected is the Dragon-Virtue Perfected of the Sea of Empty Treasure Wisdom of the Supreme Clarity. The foremost of the Female Perfected is the Jade Immortal Holy Mother, the Primordial Sovereign of the Clear Abyss.\n\nThose who receive this scripture as their sagely master shall be attended by the Dragon Lord, who bestows treasures upon those who practice its Way. The divine dragon bears the moon, its feet treading the eternal courts of the Great Empyrean. They are granted a pair of golden fish and forty-nine feet of azure-patterned silk. Should one violate the jade prohibitions and reveal it to the impure, the wind-knives shall sever their form, damming the river sources, and the water officials shall punish them with trials.\n\nTo refine the Dao, one must polish the upper jade into a lustrous pearl, like a sparrow’s egg, and store it in a golden jar, steeping it in the yellow water of moonlight. The method is as follows: for nine days and nights, retrieve it at dawn when the eastern star appears. Facing east, burn incense, bow twice, and recite the incantation:\n\n*'Divine Treasure of the Great Abyss, radiance of the bright moon.\nGuard the primal palace of my fate, transform into the divine dragon.\nThe jade embryo within transmutes, soaring at will.\nBear my true form aloft, ascending the eternal towers.'*\n\nUpon completion, close the *qi*, swallow it, and direct your intent to the *Pass of Origin*. Focus your gaze upon the pearl until it descends; if it does not, cease. If it descends, replace the pearl—failure to descend is auspicious. Thereafter, guard it at midnight for eighty-one days. A being will swim within the sea of *qi*; if your heart stirs with fear, do not be alarmed, for your soul and spirit may take flight. Always cycle in sets of eighty-one.\n\nThis pearl is the embryonic dragon treasure. It shall ascend into the Crimson Jade Abyss of the Heavenly Essence’s Central Palace, then rise to the Purple Jade Abyss of the Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Yang, known as the Upper Prime’s Jade Embryo Repository of the Primordial Pool. The divine dragon, at midnight, shall bear your form to roam the Nine Heavens. Draw the dragon’s *qi* to refine your form, merging it with the void, enabling you to enter and exit the dragon’s mouth and nostrils.\n\nYou must maintain right mindfulness of the Dao; otherwise, demons may seize you, transforming you into a deviant being. Beware! When something manifests within the *Pass of Origin*, its appearance clear, go to the confluence of rivers and seas and obtain a carp three feet long. Place the *Ascending Dragon Talisman* within its mouth—written in yellow on blue-green silk.\n\n**Talisman of the Supreme Clarity’s Red Carp Ascending Dragon**\nRecite the incantation:\n*'Dragon-embryo red carp, ingest my mystic talisman.\nThunder and lightning unite, hastening to the Jade Void,\nlifting my body aloft.'*\n\nRelease the fish into the water on the first day of the year when thunder resounds. If, at that place, swift lightning arises, the red carp shall transform into a dragon, ascending the slopes of Dragon Mound. On the day your Dao is perfected, the divine dragon shall descend, bearing you aloft to the chambers of the Flowery Pearl.\n\nThe *Dragon-Mystery Precious Writ*, inscribed in blue on yellow silk, is to be worn upon the body. It summons the spirit-dragon, refining and congealing the *Jade Embryo*—this Way is accomplished in a single ascent, fitting for the proclamation of the Perfected.\n\n**The Divine Mother of Supreme Clarity’s Flying Mystery Precious Writ of Spontaneous Wondrous Qi**\n**The Jade Embryo of the Supreme Clarity’s Abyssal Spirit-Dragon Arrives in Radiance: The Jade Stanzas of the Upper Mystery**",
