Virtues,\nThe Supreme Perfected Great Thearchs,\nThe Heavenly Thearchs and Celestial Masters,\nThe Numinous Treasure Inspectors of the Purification Fast,\nThe Great Dharma Masters,\nAnd all the lords and officials.\n\nI was born and raised in the defiled world of demons,\nSunken in the degenerate karma of this age.\nReveling in glory and splendor,\nAmidst a thousand ages of felicitous gatherings.\n\nHaving been mistakenly selected to partake in the great transformation, I received the Three Treasures’ sacred scriptures through the covenant of my three masters. With reverent offerings and devout rites, I sought to fulfill my vows. Overwhelmed by the weight of such profound grace, joy and awe intertwine within me.\n\nFrom the day I received the Dharma, I vowed to propagate its teachings, extol the great transformation, transmit it to later disciples, and open the path of deliverance for gods and humans. Now, in such-and-such prefecture, such-and-such county, such-and-such village, there resides a Taiyi Daoist, the male/female Perfected Officer So-and-So, whose nature is kind and benevolent, whose loyalty, integrity, filial piety, and obedience are steadfast. Though dwelling in this defiled world, their aspirations soar high. They purify themselves in conduct, yearning for the immortals with reverence. Having already received the supreme Dharma and the Taiyi talismanic covenant, they now present their sincerity and faith, seeking to receive the *True Scripture of the Most High Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Jade Text* and its sacred talismans. Their cinnabar sincerity is so fervent that it cannot be refused.\n\nAccordingly, I have, in accordance with the Dharma, completed the rites with So-and-So on the appointed day of the purification fast. Now, having broken the contract and transmitted the scripture, I respectfully present a memorial on yellow silk with red characters, to be borne swiftly by the Merit Officers, messengers, and flying dragon riders, ascending to the Most High. The memorial lies open upon the jade table, awaiting inspection and consideration.\n\nAfter the reading of the memorial is complete, I knock my teeth three times and declare: I, once more relying on the assembled Perfected Ones and the superior Merit Officers, messengers, and flying dragon riders, submit this report. I hereby transmit to So-and-So the *Five Chapters of the Supreme Perfected and Utmost True Great Scripture*, along with a memorial on red silk. May this be heard in the presence of the Pure and Mysterious, and may no subordinate official obstruct the qi. Let no barrier of public or private affairs hinder its ascent. I hold my breath and ascend, and the memorial reaches the Three Heavens. I prostrate myself, awaiting the response.\n\nHaving completed the prostration with the memorial, I then kneel fully and declare: I, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, humbly address the Most High—the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Self-So, the Utmost True Great Dao, the Supreme Primordial Honored One, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Dao and Virtue of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Heavenly Master of the Three Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Unity.\n\nI, this stinking corpse of flesh, a fool of lowly conduct, have by karmic affinity of past lives been undeservedly entrusted with the Three Treasures of the Great Dharma and the sacred scriptures. Yet I have failed to retire into secluded forests, transcending worldly traces. Nor have I been able to propagate the imperial teachings, widely establish fields of merit, relieve suffering and distress, or accumulate merit to atone for faults. Instead, I have mingled with ordinary folk, indistinguishable from the demonic and the vulgar. By the grace of the Great Dao, my head and neck remain intact. To this day, I behold the light of the Three Luminaries. The depth of this kindness and the weight of this bestowal are truly boundless.\n\nI, So-and-So, am filled with awe and dread, kowtowing again and again, acknowledging my mortal offenses, my mortal offenses.\n\nIt is said that the true scriptures are of such exalted worth that they cannot be practiced by the coarse and vulgar; their wondrous meanings and profound traces cannot be gazed upon by the shallow understanding and fleshly eyes of this humble servant. Yet by a stroke of fortune, I have encountered this turning of the kalpa, when the Three Caverns govern the world and the selection of seed-people is renewed. Thus, this defiled vessel has been unworthily entrusted with the numinous texts.\n\nHaving received the scriptures but recently, I am unfit to reveal them. Now, in the *renchen* cycle, the Great Peace draws near. Fortune and misfortune intertwine, and none but those who have attained the Dao can be secure. The kalpas are perilous, and though human hearts are inscrutable, the worthy diligently seek—such teachings should not be withheld.\n\nI hereby report that a certain Daoist, So-and-So, of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, has immersed himself in the Mysterious and inscribed the True, forsaking glory and splendor. His resolve is firmly set on ascending to the heights, desiring the Dao of immortality and flight. His sincerity is fervent, his longing ardent, his devotion courageous. He requests to receive the sacred texts.\n\nNow, having established the Mysterious Regulations and divided the tally to transmit the scriptures, I have sworn before the Three Officials to guard against reckless dissemination. I respectfully submit this report, awaiting your decree for its implementation.\n\nWhen the address is complete, the tally is divided but not yet bestowed. The master turns to the north, while the disciple turns left to face the south, kneeling fully and holding the cinnabar water before his heart. The master, facing north, intones:\n\nI, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, dare to address the cinnabar water: In Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, in the year *jiayi* of such-and-such a cycle, I have reverently received the oral instructions of the Yellow and Red Kings, the Great One, and the One Word. What I have been undeservedly granted is already vast.\n\nNow, I present my vows and pledge my life, as this disciple seeks to receive the *Five Chapters of the Utmost True Great Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Scripture of the Great Perfected Dao*. Earlier, I prostrated myself and presented a memorial on yellow silk and a petition on plain silk, invoking the assembly of the Most High and all the honored ones, beseeching the Lords and Officers of the Oath-Monitoring Assembly, the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable One of the Numinous Treasure, the Lords and Officers of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—and the supervising presence of my seven generations of ancestors.\n\nWitness this disciple, who from this day forward seeks life, observes purification, and dedicates his heart to receiving the wondrous scriptures and oral instructions of the Numinous Treasure. In accordance with the great Dharma, I pledge to uphold and follow them, to guard my speech and conduct with care, and to cast aside all worldly entanglements.\n\nHaving severed all external distractions, calm the mind and embrace stillness.\nFocus the will upon the Dharma, allowing no defilement to arise.\nDo not summon one another in ways that disrupt the true qi.\nEver practice great compassion, broadly delivering all beings.\nMay the realm know peace and the people abundance, the Four Seas unified in tranquility.\nMay the seven generations of ancestors all ascend and be delivered.\nMay this body enter radiant light and swiftly be reborn among humankind.\nWhen the great kalpa’s cycle reaches its end, together we shall soar to the Upper Clarity.\nFor those not yet immortalized, the span of forty years shall be the term.\nNo part of this may be leaked or recklessly transmitted to the unworthy.\nTo break the covenant or betray trust, to carelessly disclose the numinous texts—\nSuch transgressors shall see their parents in life and death bound to the eternal dark,\nenduring ten thousand kalpas of wind and blade, with no cause for complaint.\nTo violate these prohibitions and precepts is to contravene the writ of the Illuminated Perfected.\nThis disciple, [Name], having received the true command and the master’s oral instructions, dares not betray them.\nTo recklessly transmit to the unworthy shall bring calamity upon [Name]’s own person.\nVow never to betray the deities of the above and below, the center and the four directions, the eight quarters—all the true and numinous spirits.\nNow together we swallow the covenant’s cinnabar water.\nIn accordance with the Dharma, observe purification and cultivate the wondrous principles.\nPray that disciple and master alike be delivered from heavenly disasters:\nthe ninety-six solar cycles, the great calamity of the jia-shen year.\nFrom kalpa to kalpa, may there be no loss or decline.\nMay sun and moon shine as one, the Three Treasures turn in unison.\nHumbly receive from the Lord of the Numinous Treasure and the Venerable One of the Numinous Treasure the life-bestowing methods of the Three Caverns’ celestial texts.\nThe incantation complete, thrice sip the cinnabar water and receive the contract.\nThe contract bestowed, the master rises to burn incense, scatter flowers, and circumambulate while reciting the hymn of the Five Perfected Ones.\nThe disciple then bows twice in reverence.\nAll rites concluded, the disciple kneels at length, holding the Dharma token.\n\nThe master strikes his teeth thirty-six times, visualizing the colors of the five viscera forming a canopy of precious clouds, which covers master and disciple. He then recites the incantation:\n\nThe celestial writ is never cumbersome,\nFor the Dao and virtue are complete of themselves.\nCultivate them and you shall surely become an immortal—\nWhat more could you desire?\nThe radiance of scripture fills the Great Void,\nResplendent and luminous.\nTransmission must follow the Dharma—\nRevelation or negligence leads to hell.\n\nThe incantation complete, the disciple bows thrice to receive the scripture. He then performs a single prostration, circumambulating the ten directions, beginning from the north and turning eastward in a full circuit. He visualizes the true forms of the Most High in the ten directions, each appearing as their directional icon.\n\nThe master recites the *Hymn of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings*. When finished, he recites the *Three Wisdom Hymns*, expounds the Dharma, confers the Ten Precepts, and concludes the ordination rites. The merits are declared, and ranks are restored.\n\nThe *Cavernous Mystery Rite of the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Contract* is now complete.",

      "translated_text": "Having completed the prostration with the memorial, I then kneel fully and declare: I, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, humbly address the Most High—the Formless and Nameless, the Void and Self-So, the Utmost True Great Dao, the Supreme Primordial Honored One, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthies of the Dao and Virtue of the Ten Directions and Boundless Realms, the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Heavenly Master of the Three Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Unity.\n\nI, this stinking corpse of flesh, a fool of lowly conduct, have by karmic affinity of past lives been undeservedly entrusted with the Three Treasures of the Great Dharma and the sacred scriptures. Yet I have failed to retire into secluded forests, transcending worldly traces. Nor have I been able to propagate the imperial teachings, widely establish fields of merit, relieve suffering and distress, or accumulate merit to atone for faults. Instead, I have mingled with ordinary folk, indistinguishable from the demonic and the vulgar. By the grace of the Great Dao, my head and neck remain intact. To this day, I behold the light of the Three Luminaries. The depth of this kindness and the weight of this bestowal are truly boundless.\n\nI, So-and-So, am filled with awe and dread, kowtowing again and again, acknowledging my mortal offenses, my mortal offenses.\n\nIt is said that the true scriptures are of such exalted worth that they cannot be practiced by the coarse and vulgar; their wondrous meanings and profound traces cannot be gazed upon by the shallow understanding and fleshly eyes of this humble servant. Yet by a stroke of fortune, I have encountered this turning of the kalpa, when the Three Caverns govern the world and the selection of seed-people is renewed. Thus, this defiled vessel has been unworthily entrusted with the numinous texts.\n\nHaving received the scriptures but recently, I am unfit to reveal them. Now, in the *renchen* cycle, the Great Peace draws near. Fortune and misfortune intertwine, and none but those who have attained the Dao can be secure. The kalpas are perilous, and though human hearts are inscrutable, the worthy diligently seek—such teachings should not be withheld.\n\nI hereby report that a certain Daoist, So-and-So, of Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, has immersed himself in the Mysterious and inscribed the True, forsaking glory and splendor. His resolve is firmly set on ascending to the heights, desiring the Dao of immortality and flight. His sincerity is fervent, his longing ardent, his devotion courageous. He requests to receive the sacred texts.\n\nNow, having established the Mysterious Regulations and divided the tally to transmit the scriptures, I have sworn before the Three Officials to guard against reckless dissemination. I respectfully submit this report, awaiting your decree for its implementation.\n\nWhen the address is complete, the tally is divided but not yet bestowed. The master turns to the north, while the disciple turns left to face the south, kneeling fully and holding the cinnabar water before his heart. The master, facing north, intones:\n\nI, So-and-So, a Master of the Dharma Office of Such-and-Such Sacred Peak, dare to address the cinnabar water: In Such-and-Such Prefecture, County, and Village, in the year *jiayi* of such-and-such a cycle, I have reverently received the oral instructions of the Yellow and Red Kings, the Great One, and the One Word. What I have been undeservedly granted is already vast.\n\nNow, I present my vows and pledge my life, as this disciple seeks to receive the *Five Chapters of the Utmost True Great Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* and the *Scripture of the Great Perfected Dao*. Earlier, I prostrated myself and presented a memorial on yellow silk and a petition on plain silk, invoking the assembly of the Most High and all the honored ones, beseeching the Lords and Officers of the Oath-Monitoring Assembly, the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable One of the Numinous Treasure, the Lords and Officers of the Three Officials—Heaven, Earth, and Water—and the supervising presence of my seven generations of ancestors.\n\nWitness this disciple, who from this day forward seeks life, observes purification, and dedicates his heart to receiving the wondrous scriptures and oral instructions of the Numinous Treasure. In accordance with the great Dharma, I pledge to uphold and follow them, to guard my speech and conduct with care, and to cast aside all worldly entanglements.",

I hereby transmit to So-and-So the *Five Chapters of the Supreme Perfected and Utmost True Great Scripture*, along with a memorial on red silk. May this be heard in the presence of the Pure and Mysterious, and may no subordinate official obstruct the qi. Let no barrier of public or private affairs hinder its ascent. I hold my breath and ascend, and the memorial reaches the Three Heavens. I prostrate myself, awaiting the response.",
