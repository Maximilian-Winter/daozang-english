Borrows from the* Upper Clarity Essential Matters for Cultivating the Body *and expounds methods of nourishing life. One scroll.*\n\n**Source:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\n---\n\n### **The Six Jia Spirit Names**\nThe spirit of Jiazi is named Wang Wenqing.\nThe spirit of Jiaxu is named Zhan Zijiang.\nThe spirit of Jiashen is named Hu Wenchang.\nThe spirit of Jiawu is named Wei Shangqing.\nThe spirit of Jiachen is named Meng Feiqing.\nThe spirit of Jiayin is named Ming Wenzhang.\n\nFor all those who cultivate practice, if they constantly visualize the names of the Six Jia spirits, their seven orifices will open and flow freely, they will be free from all illnesses, and they will not encounter misfortune or calamity. If they encounter bandits, they may call upon the spirit of the day to assist them.\n\n### **The Four Sea Spirit Names**\nThe spirit of the Eastern Sea is named Aming.\nThe spirit of the Western Sea is named Jucheng.\nThe spirit of the Southern Sea is named Zhurong.\nThe spirit of the Northern Sea is named Xuanming.\n\nFor all those who cultivate practice, at every dawn when the rooster crows, they should recite this method three times, invoking the great spirits of the Four Seas to repel demonic hordes, dispel inauspicious omens, and swiftly act in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.\n\nEvery day at cockcrow, first call upon:\nThe **Upper Crimson Child**, who guards the Upper Cinnabar Field.\nThe **Middle Perfected Child**, who guards the Middle Cinnabar Field.\nThe **Lower Infant of Primordial Yang Valley**, who guards the Lower Cinnabar Field.\n\nFor those who cultivate practice, at every dawn when the rooster crows and at the first moment of lying down at night, they should constantly visualize and invoke this method, which can repel demonic forces, dissolve disasters, and dispel illness. When reciting the names of the Three Ones, the heart should visualize their forms as infants. Each infant should be visualized as three inches in length, in their newly born form, all clad in red garments. On Jiazi days, do not visualize the Three One spirits—this is a strict prohibition.\n\n### **Laozi’s Method for Governing the Body and Guarding the One**\nAt cockcrow, always rub and wipe both eyes, first reciting the incantation:\n*\"The Queen Mother of the West’s daughter is named Yi Yu.\nShe bestows upon me eye medicine, which I receive in my mouth,\nand immediately refine through rubbing.\nAlways at cockcrow, the numinous fluid of the two sevens\ndispels dimness of sight, allowing one to gaze ten thousand miles\nand see clearly in all four directions.\"*\n\nAfter reciting the incantation, cup the hands and exhale gently three times, then slightly moisten the palms with saliva. Rub the hands until warm, then massage the eyes fourteen times, enabling the eyes to become bright and attain the vision of immortals.\n\nEvery day at cockcrow, always close the eyes and secretly recite the incantation:\n*\"Yellow-robed child, Yellow-robed child,\nThe Perfected One of the Yellow Court is ever within me.\nFetch for me sweet wine, rich meats,\nfine grains, millet stew, divine elixirs, and jade mushrooms—\nall edible things come to me, entering my mouth,\nfilling my five viscera, nourishing the hundred spirits,\nso that I neither hunger nor thirst,\nequal in span to Heaven and Earth,\nradiant as the sun and moon,\npreserved for a thousand myriad years.\"*\n\nFor all those who cultivate practice, every day at cockcrow, first recite this secretly three times, then cease after swallowing qi five times. Before each swallow, rinse with numinous fluid, gently puff the cheeks, visualize yellow qi filling the mouth, and then swallow it—naturally, one will be sated. This also internally dispels the hundred illnesses and prolongs life.\n\nEvery day at dawn, knock the teeth three times, call upon the names of the three hun souls, and recite the incantation:\n*\"Fetal Radiance prolongs life,\nLuminous Spirit increases fortune,\nMysterious Essence dispels death.\nSwiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\"*\n\nFor all those who cultivate practice, if they do this every day, the three hun souls will not leave their sides. They will be free from unexpected disasters, malevolent ghosts, and inauspicious spirits, and will not be harmed. Wandering dreams and strange transformations will be cut off from the bedchamber.\n\nThe *Scripture of the Immortals* states: *\"For those who study the Dao, if they always speak of good deeds in the morning, Heaven will grant them blessings. They must not utter the word ‘how’ in the morning, nor should they sing or play music—this is called inviting misfortune, and they must strictly guard against it.\"*\n\nWhen lying in bed, do not sing or chant, and do not sleep face down—these three taboos are all greatly inauspicious and diminish one’s lifespan.\n\nFor those who study the Dao, the foremost desire is to broadly practice hidden virtue, be compassionate toward all things, rescue those in peril, deliver people from suffering, value the Dao over wealth, and bestow kindness and spread virtue.\n\nIn the practice of Guarding the One, when encountering distress or calamity, recite the One once, bow twice toward the direction of the master, and seek deliverance—immediately, great urgency will be resolved. Simply recite with the heart and bow.\n\nThe foundation of Guarding the One is forbearance. When desiring to kill, visualize flying immortals. When desiring jealousy, visualize great spirits. When desiring greed, visualize perfected ones.\n\nIf one cannot fully attain the practice of Guarding the One, constantly focus the mind on it. If suddenly committing evil, think of what is startling or terrifying, and rise to gaze at the Auxiliary Star of the Northern Dipper. The Auxiliary Star is the sixth of the Seven Stars. Recite the One together with it, and the hundred evils will retreat, and the body will be free from misfortune. If the sky is overcast and the stars are not visible, simply concentrate the mind on the One.\n\nLaozi said: *\"For all who wish to cultivate the Dao, the heart must not be divided. Heaven, by guarding the One, covers all without lifting. Earth, by guarding the One, remains still and at peace. Mountains, by guarding the One, are undisturbed by heat or cold. The sea, by guarding the One, flows without returning. People, by guarding the One, will surely attain immortality.\"*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: *\"When combing the hair, always face one’s life destiny. At the beginning of combing, silently recite the incantation:\n‘The Great Emperor scatters numinosity,\nThe Five Elders return their spirits.\nThe Mysterious Flower of the Mud-Pill Palace preserves essence and ensures its eternal existence.\nOn the left, the Hidden Moon is restrained;\non the right, the Root of the Sun is drawn.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nand the hundred spirits receive grace.’\nAfter the incantation, swallow saliva three times. Constantly practicing this prevents headaches.\"*\n\nWhen sitting or lying down, always desire the nostrils to face one’s life destiny. This is also true for eating, drinking, and taking medicine. If unable to face one’s life destiny, constantly facing the northeast or northwest is also excellent. These two directions are the passes of the hun and po souls of Heaven and Earth.\n\nUpon rising from sleep, always gently shake the body left and right several tens of times.\n\nWhen finished, clasp the hands behind the head, tilt it back, and exhale toward Heaven. Gently shake the neck left and right twenty times. When done, sit upright and raise both hands for a long while. Then rub from the corners of the eyes to the ears, again for a long while.\n\nRecite the yin incantation:\n*\"Front clasp and rear pat,\nHeaven and Earth’s honored guest,\nLeft glance and right gaze,\nLongevity’s great measure.\nTilt back the head and exhale,\nGrand Unity in mutual extremity.\nThe Moon-retreating Dragon lies prone,\nController of Life in shared alignment.\nConsuming food and the primordial embryo,\nExchanging at Kunlun’s passes,\nTurning and kneeling in pairs,\nPerfected Ones of shared aspiration.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, draw in qi and hold it. Visualize a red qi, thin as a thread, emerging from the navel and entering the nostrils—do this three times.\n\nWhen the Dao of massage is fully completed, it unblocks the hundred passages, ensuring boundless longevity and freedom from illness.\n\n*Attaining Perfection* states: To prolong life, one must wash the face with focused intent. When the sun has risen two *zhang*, face it directly, exhale stale qi from the mouth, and inhale solar essence through the nose until a sneeze occurs—then stop. This is called \"qi communication,\" a method to replenish essence and restore the primordial embryo.\n\n*Attaining Perfection* states: To keep the heart constantly aligned, when the sun has risen three *zhang*, cross the hands over the shoulders, position the heart toward the sun, and let the sun’s rays strike it directly. When warmth is felt within, visualize the sun’s radiance entering the heart—this subtle warmth confirms the heart’s alignment. Regular practice is excellent.\n\n**Laozi’s Method for Governing the Body and Guarding the One**\nBefore eating, secretly recite:\n*\"So-and-so establishes the body for the Dao,\nthe body as Heaven’s palace.\nDao Father and Dao Mother,\nPerfected Ones, Divine Ones, Immortal Ones,\nDaoists and Sages,\nunite as the Dao,\ntogether partaking in food,\nattaining boundless longevity.\"*\n\nBefore drinking water, first exhale three times, then recite:\n*\"Qian’s origin, enjoyment, benefit, and uprightness—\nthe body as the sun,\nthe King’s divine water enters the abdomen,\nthe five viscera cool and refreshed.\"*\n\nAlways recite this incantation before drinking.\n\nMaster Wang says: Do not speak of death or inauspicious matters while eating, preparing medicines, or refining elixirs—this is strictly forbidden. When taking medicine, always face one’s life destiny. Afterward, avoid speaking of death, lest the fetal spirit be harmed, rendering the medicine futile and without benefit.\n\n**Laozi’s Method for Governing the Body and Guarding the One**\nBefore consuming any meal or medicine, first recite this incantation:\n*\"Yellow-robed child, I call you thrice,\nfetch for me rich meats and fine wine,\nmillet and millet stew,\ndivine elixirs and jade mushrooms,\nand place them in this vessel of food\nand this vessel of medicine.\nThe Three Ones—upper, middle, and lower—\neach descend into the food and medicine vessels to eat,\nsharing the feast and nourishing my body.\nAlso visualize three infant spirits,\neach three *cun* tall, clad in red,\nseated in the vessel, partaking of the meal.\"*\n\nIf dining with others, omit the incantation but still visualize the three infants, who will sequentially consume the food before you eat.\n\nBy constantly visualizing the Three Ones day and night, one accumulates blessings, extends life, and wards off evil and illness.\n\nRecite another incantation:\n*\"All medicines enter the stomach,\nuniting with the spirit and qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids.\nCorpse-demons perish and fall,\nascending as immortals to the Golden Gates,\ncommanding the Six Dings,\nwith spirit youths in attendance.\"*\n\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Dao of nurturing life begins with recognizing one’s own form, visualizing it so vividly that it appears before you. Let the face perpetually bear the light of the sun and moon, illuminating the entire body. Visualize the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine *cun* before the face. Then knock the teeth three times and softly recite:\n*\"Primordial embryo, Supreme Perfected,\nDual Radiance, Two Mysteries,\nleft embracing the seven *po*,\nright restraining the three *hun*,\nmay my spirit and brightness\nendure with my form forever.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, knock the teeth three more times and swallow saliva three times.\n\nThis is called the \"Method of the Supreme Thearch for Recording the Form, Restraining the *Hun*, and Controlling the *Po*.\" Practicing it tirelessly ensures the *hun* and *po* never leave the body—this is the essential Dao of immortality and longevity.\n\n*The Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: On the face, always rub with both hands, following its contours up and down. Rub frequently, without fixed timing. Regular practice unblocks the ears and eyes. Constantly press the small hollows behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times, and rub the cheeks below the eyes with the palms and fingers—more is better. Rotate the ears thirty times, then stroke the forehead upward thirty-nine times, starting between the eyebrows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva freely, without counting. With regular practice, the eyes will become clear, and within a year, one may read by night.\n\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: For any bodily pain, at the time of generating qi, swallow saliva fourteen times and press the painful area. Face the direction of the King and recite:\n*\"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,\nThree Spirits unite as Perfected.\nLeft Yellow, Right Yellow,\nSix Radiances align.\nWind, qi, and malign illnesses,\nsubdued in the four directions.\nJade fluid flows and moistens,\ncirculating above and below.\nInternally dispatching water and fire,\nexternally repelling inauspiciousness,\nascending as flying immortals,\nthe body ever strong.\"*\n\nThen press the painful area thirty-one times. Consistent practice ensures freedom from illness.\n\n**Master Peng’s Oral Instructions:**\nEvery day at dawn before rising and at night when first lying down, visualize the Perfected One, Zidan, between the eyebrows, wearing a green turban. Constantly dwelling on this thought grants a lifespan of eight hundred years.\n\nMaster Wang says: When traveling at night or lying in darkness, if fear arises in the heart, visualize the sun and moon returning to the Bright Hall—soon, all evil will vanish. Those dwelling in the mountains should do this regularly.\n\nThe Master says: When traveling at night, recite: *\"Taiyin Jun, Taiyin Jun, come to me, come to me.\"* This incantation repels all harm. Before night travel, first pray: *\"One lord before me, two lords behind me—all evil and malevolent beings shall not draw near.\"*\n\nTo seek the method of longevity: On the last day of the lunar month at the hour of *rending* (when people settle for the night), lie with your head to the north, press your hand firmly over your heart, and pray: *\"Lords of the five viscera, seven spirits of virtue and power, Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother, Sun Lord and Moon Minister—may all the heavens descend, guarding and protecting the Perfected One. A thousand spirits and a hundred numina, preserve my body. I beseech only for long life, to shed the old and renew the self. For men, seven invocations; for women, two invocations.\"* (Men are called *gongzhao*; women, *shuzhao*.)\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Green Ox Daoist:**\nEvery night before sleep, visualize the sun above your forehead and the moon below your navel—this repels a thousand ghosts and ten thousand evils, summoning the Jade Maidens of the Heavenly Palace. *Secret and efficacious, secret and efficacious.*\n\nBefore sleep, pray: *\"Vast and boundless, misfortune departs and fortune arrives. Boundless and vast, banish calamity and evil. The Supreme bestows longevity; the Controller of Destinies governs it. My name ascends to the Jade Register, bound with azure silk. All spirits assemble—every disaster is dispelled.\"*\n\nWhen first lying down at night, once on the bed, turn your shoes to face outward and recite: *\"Turning shoes away from the bed, repel evil and avert weapons. Wardens of the Heavenly Prison, forbid ghosts from night travel. For grave offenses, sever at the waist; for lesser, cast into the marketplace. Neither grave nor light—cut off the ears of the ghost. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Lord Lao!\"* Then click your teeth three times.\n\nEvery night before sleep, click your teeth twenty-one times, press your left hand to your heart, and call the names of the Three Corpses: *\"Upper Corpse Pengju, depart! Middle Corpse Pengzhi, depart! Lower Corpse Pengjiao, depart!\"* Thus they cannot cause harm.\n\nWhen first lying down at night, lie flat on your back, press both hands to your heart, and recite: *\"Divine beings, divine beings—radiance arises in the five viscera. Preserve my marrow, nourish my vital essence. The divine radiance is now firm; reverse aging and extend years. Heavenly talismans, heavenly talismans, protect my body. Where spirit dwells, divine radiance flows. Desires are fulfilled; aversions are subdued. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the Most High Lord Lao!\"*\n\nThen recite: *\"Celestial Numinous Splendor, may I attain long life. The Supreme Unity, the True Mystery, guards my form. Lords of the five viscera, each find peace.\"* Men recite this seven times; women, fourteen times.\n\nThe Perfected One always, at midnight, removes the pillow and lies flat, fists clenched and body relaxed. When the breath is regulated and subtle, the body’s spirits are complete. If they are not, rise swiftly, burn incense, sit with eyes closed, fists clenched over the knees, and visualize the body’s spirits. Let two eyes emit white qi, the size of a chicken’s egg, before your gaze—thus the original state is restored. Practice this every five days; this pertains to the affairs of the Twenty-Four Spirits.\n\nWhen donning new clothes, lift your head toward the sun and recite: *\"Resplendent and radiant, my body bears divine light. Wearing these garments, may wealth, honor, and good fortune flourish, and my lifespan extend.\"*\n\nUpon waking at night, swiftly close both eyes, click your teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and press your hands along the sides of your nose, moving up and down dozens of times. Softly pray: *\"Supreme Four Illuminations, the nine gates emit essence. Ears and eyes penetrate the mysterious, connecting to the true and reaching the numinous. The Terrace of Heaven’s Center, flowing qi harmonized. The Maiden Jiao, cloud-like bearing; the Eye Lad, keen and bright. Radiant hearing and vision, all things clear and distant. Preserve harmony in the Upper Prime, wander the Nine Citadels. The five viscera take root; ears and eyes regenerate. The Heavenly Terrace’s purity, pillars unshaken. The seven po refined, the three hun at peace. The Red Child carries the light, ever at my side. Should any dare obscure my ears and eyes, the Supreme shall crush them with the Flowing Bell. Ten thousand evils vanish; every wish is fulfilled. Sun and moon guard the gates; the heart harbors the five stars. As the True Sovereign prays, let all echoes heed.\"* Then swallow saliva nine more times.\n\nAfterward, rub your face until slightly warm, and make this a regular practice. Upon waking, always perform this pressing and prayer—do not miss a single awakening. With consistent practice, one’s ears and eyes grow sharp, memory strong and mind clear, the nose balanced without spittle or mucus, the face youthful. Master the hun and record the po, repelling ten thousand demons.\n\n**The Supreme Simplicity Perfected One’s Teachings for Beginners to Repel Nightmares:**\nFrequent nightmares indicate: on the first day, *po* disturbances; on the second, trials of the heart; on the third, corpse thieves. To dispel them: upon waking from a nightmare, rise at once and sit facing north. With your left hand, pinch the philtrum thirty-four times. With the second and third fingers, pinch the *Shanyuan* (the root of the nose, near the base) thirty-four times, without lifting your hand. Tap your teeth thirty-four times, then softly pray: *\"Supreme Cavern, True Mystery—temper and refine the three hun. The first hun swiftly guards the po; the second hun swiftly guards the Muddy Pellet; the third hun obeys the heart’s command. Swiftly invoke the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme. I have encountered an inauspicious dream—these are the seven po’s wandering corpses, bringing the source of ten thousand evils. Urgently summon Taokang to protect my life. Report above to the Imperial Lords, the Five Elders, and the Nine Perfected. All guard the Gate of Life. The Yellow Gate Marshal and the Purple Door General wield halberds and grasp bells, dispelling evil essences. Turn misfortune to fortune; sever the causes of life and death.\"*\n\nIf you encounter a propitious dream at night and deem it auspicious, it is a favorable omen. Upon waking, rub your eyes thirty-four times, tap your teeth thirty-four times, and softly recite: *\"Supreme High Essence, Three Emperors’ cinnabar numen. The Crimson Palace shines clearly; auspicious omens convey their message. The Three Primordials guard the po; the Heavenly Sovereign receives the scripture. All endeavors harmonize; flying immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity. Ever with the Jade Perfected, we gather in the Purple Court.\"* This is the secret method of the Great Cavern, transmitted to those newly entering the stream.\n\nUpon awakening from an ill dream at night, immediately turn your pillow or replace it, then recite the prayer: *\"Supreme Dark Jade Maiden, attend the true and guard the hun-soul. Six Palaces’ Golden Youths, come and guard the Gate of Life. Transform evil into good; inscribe it in the Three Primordials. Grant me long life, that I may ride the radiance and mount the clouds.\"* After reciting, swallow saliva seven times, tap the teeth seven times, and lie down again. Repeat this four or five times, and all ill omens will naturally dissipate. This prayer also reverses ill dreams, turning them into auspicious signs.\n\nThe Perfected One said: The method for entering the privy—when first ascending, recite the prayer: *\"Left Virtue Lord, Right Virtue Lord, Supreme Controller of Destiny, Pure Lady, remove so-and-so’s name from the register of death and inscribe it in the Gate of Life.\"* The method for using privy grass: First place one stalk on the left as the Left Virtue Lord, then place one on the right as the Right Virtue Lord. Place another in the center to remove so-and-so’s name from the register of death and inscribe it in the Gate of Life. The length of privy grass must not exceed nine inches; exceeding this measure will diminish one’s lifespan—this must be strictly avoided. If defecating in the wild, recite: *\"Lady of the Wilds, Lady of the Wilds, remove so-and-so’s name from the register of death and inscribe it in the Gate of Life.\"* The prayer for using privy grass is the same as the method for the privy above.\n\n*The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery and Numinous Treasure: Methods of the Perfected for Cultivating Practice, Prolonging Life, and Extending Destiny* concludes.",

They must not utter the word ‘how’ in the morning, nor should they sing or play music—this is called inviting misfortune, and they must strictly guard against it.\"*\n\nWhen lying in bed, do not sing or chant, and do not sleep face down—these three taboos are all greatly inauspicious and diminish one’s lifespan.\n\nFor those who study the Dao, the foremost desire is to broadly practice hidden virtue, be compassionate toward all things, rescue those in peril, deliver people from suffering, value the Dao over wealth, and bestow kindness and spread virtue.\n\nIn the practice of Guarding the One, when encountering distress or calamity, recite the One once, bow twice toward the direction of the master, and seek deliverance—immediately, great urgency will be resolved. Simply recite with the heart and bow.\n\nThe foundation of Guarding the One is forbearance. When desiring to kill, visualize flying immortals. When desiring jealousy, visualize great spirits. When desiring greed, visualize perfected ones.\n\nIf one cannot fully attain the practice of Guarding the One, constantly focus the mind on it. If suddenly committing evil, think of what is startling or terrifying, and rise to gaze at the Auxiliary Star of the Northern Dipper. The Auxiliary Star is the sixth of the Seven Stars. Recite the One together with it, and the hundred evils will retreat, and the body will be free from misfortune. If the sky is overcast and the stars are not visible, simply concentrate the mind on the One.\n\nLaozi said: *\"For all who wish to cultivate the Dao, the heart must not be divided. Heaven, by guarding the One, covers all without lifting. Earth, by guarding the One, remains still and at peace. Mountains, by guarding the One, are undisturbed by heat or cold. The sea, by guarding the One, flows without returning. People, by guarding the One, will surely attain immortality.\"*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West said: *\"When combing the hair, always face one’s life destiny. At the beginning of combing, silently recite the incantation:\n‘The Great Emperor scatters numinosity,\nThe Five Elders return their spirits.\nThe Mysterious Flower of the Mud-Pill Palace preserves essence and ensures its eternal existence.\nOn the left, the Hidden Moon is restrained;\non the right, the Root of the Sun is drawn.\nThe Six Harmonies refine and purify,\nand the hundred spirits receive grace.’\nAfter the incantation, swallow saliva three times. Constantly practicing this prevents headaches.\"*\n\nWhen sitting or lying down, always desire the nostrils to face one’s life destiny. This is also true for eating, drinking, and taking medicine. If unable to face one’s life destiny, constantly facing the northeast or northwest is also excellent. These two directions are the passes of the hun and po souls of Heaven and Earth.\n\nUpon rising from sleep, always gently shake the body left and right several tens of times.",

When done, sit upright and raise both hands for a long while.

Visualize a red qi, thin as a thread, emerging from the navel and entering the nostrils—do this three times.\n\nWhen the Dao of massage is fully completed, it unblocks the hundred passages, ensuring boundless longevity and freedom from illness.\n\n*Attaining Perfection* states: To prolong life, one must wash the face with focused intent. When the sun has risen two *zhang*, face it directly, exhale stale qi from the mouth, and inhale solar essence through the nose until a sneeze occurs—then stop. This is called \"qi communication,\" a method to replenish essence and restore the primordial embryo.\n\n*Attaining Perfection* states: To keep the heart constantly aligned, when the sun has risen three *zhang*, cross the hands over the shoulders, position the heart toward the sun, and let the sun’s rays strike it directly. When warmth is felt within, visualize the sun’s radiance entering the heart—this subtle warmth confirms the heart’s alignment. Regular practice is excellent.\n\n**Laozi’s Method for Governing the Body and Guarding the One**\nBefore eating, secretly recite:\n*\"So-and-so establishes the body for the Dao,\nthe body as Heaven’s palace.\nDao Father and Dao Mother,\nPerfected Ones, Divine Ones, Immortal Ones,\nDaoists and Sages,\nunite as the Dao,\ntogether partaking in food,\nattaining boundless longevity.\"*\n\nBefore drinking water, first exhale three times, then recite:\n*\"Qian’s origin, enjoyment, benefit, and uprightness—\nthe body as the sun,\nthe King’s divine water enters the abdomen,\nthe five viscera cool and refreshed.\"*\n\nAlways recite this incantation before drinking.\n\nMaster Wang says: Do not speak of death or inauspicious matters while eating, preparing medicines, or refining elixirs—this is strictly forbidden. When taking medicine, always face one’s life destiny. Afterward, avoid speaking of death, lest the fetal spirit be harmed, rendering the medicine futile and without benefit.\n\n**Laozi’s Method for Governing the Body and Guarding the One**\nBefore consuming any meal or medicine, first recite this incantation:\n*\"Yellow-robed child, I call you thrice,\nfetch for me rich meats and fine wine,\nmillet and millet stew,\ndivine elixirs and jade mushrooms,\nand place them in this vessel of food\nand this vessel of medicine.\nThe Three Ones—upper, middle, and lower—\neach descend into the food and medicine vessels to eat,\nsharing the feast and nourishing my body.\nAlso visualize three infant spirits,\neach three *cun* tall, clad in red,\nseated in the vessel, partaking of the meal.\"*\n\nIf dining with others, omit the incantation but still visualize the three infants, who will sequentially consume the food before you eat.\n\nBy constantly visualizing the Three Ones day and night, one accumulates blessings, extends life, and wards off evil and illness.\n\nRecite another incantation:\n*\"All medicines enter the stomach,\nuniting with the spirit and qi,\nfilling and replenishing blood and fluids.\nCorpse-demons perish and fall,\nascending as immortals to the Golden Gates,\ncommanding the Six Dings,\nwith spirit youths in attendance.\"*\n\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: The Dao of nurturing life begins with recognizing one’s own form, visualizing it so vividly that it appears before you. Let the face perpetually bear the light of the sun and moon, illuminating the entire body. Visualize the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine *cun* before the face. Then knock the teeth three times and softly recite:\n*\"Primordial embryo, Supreme Perfected,\nDual Radiance, Two Mysteries,\nleft embracing the seven *po*,\nright restraining the three *hun*,\nmay my spirit and brightness\nendure with my form forever.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, knock the teeth three more times and swallow saliva three times.\n\nThis is called the \"Method of the Supreme Thearch for Recording the Form, Restraining the *Hun*, and Controlling the *Po*.\" Practicing it tirelessly ensures the *hun* and *po* never leave the body—this is the essential Dao of immortality and longevity.\n\n*The Scripture of Great Simplicity and Cinnabar Radiance* states: On the face, always rub with both hands, following its contours up and down. Rub frequently, without fixed timing. Regular practice unblocks the ears and eyes. Constantly press the small hollows behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times, and rub the cheeks below the eyes with the palms and fingers—more is better. Rotate the ears thirty times, then stroke the forehead upward thirty-nine times, starting between the eyebrows and moving into the hairline. Swallow saliva freely, without counting. With regular practice, the eyes will become clear, and within a year, one may read by night.\n\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: For any bodily pain, at the time of generating qi, swallow saliva fourteen times and press the painful area. Face the direction of the King and recite:\n*\"Left Mystery, Right Mystery,\nThree Spirits unite as Perfected.\nLeft Yellow, Right Yellow,\nSix Radiances align.\nWind, qi, and malign illnesses,\nsubdued in the four directions.\nJade fluid flows and moistens,\ncirculating above and below.\nInternally dispatching water and fire,\nexternally repelling inauspiciousness,\nascending as flying immortals,\nthe body ever strong.\"*\n\nThen press the painful area thirty-one times.

Let two eyes emit white qi, the size of a chicken’s egg, before your gaze—thus the original state is restored. Practice this every five days; this pertains to the affairs of the Twenty-Four Spirits.\n\nWhen donning new clothes, lift your head toward the sun and recite: *\"Resplendent and radiant, my body bears divine light.

With the second and third fingers, pinch the *Shanyuan* (the root of the nose, near the base) thirty-four times, without lifting your hand.
