  "full_translation": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Woodblock Edition of the *Chronological Biography of Patriarch Lü*, Preserved in Kongqing Grotto-Heaven**\n\nLong ago, Patriarch Lü wandered to the Grass Hall by the Northern Sea of Lu Immortal, manifesting his form to expound the Dao and deliver sentient beings, leaving behind several dozen entries recorded by Elder Guest as if conversing in an ordinary household. Herein lie traces of both worldly engagement and transcendence, stirring those who dwell in hidden emptiness, that they may know the weight of their immortal roots, the rarity of encountering the true Dao, the futility of clinging to fame and rank, and the folly of coveting worldly affairs. Why roam the maps of the earth again? Why dream the yellow millet dream anew? Such is the teaching embodied in his person.\n\nUpon close examination of his intent, one finds it more unburdened than that of Lu Sheng or Chen Sheng. I, Yue Sheng, though foolish, read the *Biographies of the Immortals* in my youth and took an immediate fondness for Patriarch Lü, as if bound to him by a predestined affinity. Later, upon reading the play script of Handan, I composed a poem:\n\n*\"The desire for fame chilled ten years ago,\nI sought to outdo Lu Sheng in one move.\nRather than dream of yellow millet and noble rank,\nI’d take up lute and sword to learn the immortal’s way.\"*\n\nThis was my own awakening, requiring no labored persuasion from the Master.\n\nOne day, entering a temple to view ancient paintings, I saw a figure with a blue headscarf, a black sash, a flute at the waist, and a whisk in hand—recognizing it as the true likeness of Patriarch Lü. I sought it out and enshrined it. Soon after, I obtained the *Complete Works of Han San*, and upon opening the scroll, I attained great enlightenment: the work of immortals lies within oneself, not in the three mountains of Penglai.\n\nBurning incense and bowing in reverence, I vowed to uphold the true teaching. Thereafter, whenever I studied the Patriarch’s deeds, I recorded the places, times, and circumstances of his deliverance of others—not as formal biographies, but as accounts. All this was to express my devotion to saving the world, with precision, detail, rigor, and care.\n\nWhat remained unsatisfactory was the inconsistency in immortal texts regarding the facts of Patriarch Lü’s birth, cultivation, and emergence. Though I longed to verify the truth, my limited understanding left the matter unresolved. Finally, I obtained *The Record of Daoist Affinities with Immortal Lu of Huaihai* and *Elder Guest’s Personal Records*. Amidst the clamor of conflicting accounts, the truth at last became clear. Bowing before the seat of the Master, I now respectfully present this *Chronological Biography*.\n\n---\n\nUpon the completion of this *Chronological Biography*, an elderly man with five long strands of beard, who styled himself Master Wushan, arrived. Accompanying him was a refined scholar from Yangzhou, and together they claimed to be from the southern regions. Their voices resonant as great bells, they perused the *Chronological Biography* with delight. The elder declared that he had grasped the true essence of Patriarch Lü’s teachings and proceeded to add several dozen marginal notes before vanishing without a trace. At the time, I had just kindled the stove to brew wine, intending to await the visit of a reclusive guest—yet by the time I turned to greet them, they had already disappeared without a trace.\n\nSome speculate that \"Wushan\" signifies \"five mouths, one mountain,\" while \"southern regions\" refers to the language of the immortals dwelling atop Zhongnan Peak. Moreover, given the sobriquet \"Lü of the Southern Regions\" in certain texts, this elder must have been none other than Master Lü himself. As for the refined scholar from Yangzhou, could he have been the immortal Lu of Huaihai?\n\n**Nine Principles of Compilation:**\n\n1. This *Chronological Biography* prioritizes factual accuracy. Previous accounts have varied widely; this edition takes *The Master’s Personal Records from the Thatched Hall* and *The Record of Daoist Affinities* as its primary sources, for these were received firsthand and thus hold greater veracity than other versions.\n\n2. Patriarch Lü often engaged in playful transformations, leaving his surname, native place, birth year, month, and day ever-shifting—much like the allegorical language of alchemical texts.\n\n3. Though *Dragon Sands* became widely circulated only in the Ming and Qing dynasties, its contents are highly selective. As Patriarch Lü once said: \"In a single day, I attend three thousand grand assemblies, yet of the hundreds of altars, only one or two are chosen. Even among those, only a few individuals are selected.\" This reflects the utmost rigor in verification.\n\n4. *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* records many instances of deliverance, and the deeds of figures like Han, He, Cao, and Lan often parallel those of Patriarch Lü, albeit with discrepancies. This edition provides detailed distinctions, clearly separating the traces of master and disciples.\n\n5. Those delivered by Patriarch Lü were all individuals of genuine merit, as attested in ancient texts, with few omissions. As for his myriad manifestations, these represent but one in ten thousand—let the discerning reader take note.\n\n6. Though figures such as Xiao Dongxuan and Wang Chang are recognized by *The Register of Divine Immortals* as disciples of Patriarch Lü, *The Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* places them in the pre-Zhenyuan period. This edition refrains from including them.\n\n7. *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* and *The Collected Poems* mutually elucidate one another: where the poems are brief, *Marvelous Encounters* provides detail, and where the poems are thorough, *Marvelous Encounters* does not repeat.\n\n8. Some entries in *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* overlap with the prefaces to the poems, but as this is a chronological compilation, repetition is unavoidable.\n\n9. This work emphasizes the correlation of events with their dates. Where it corrects errors in the annals of divine immortals, any omissions or inadequacies may be supplemented by scholars of antiquity.\n\n*[The above excerpted from *Mystic Threads of Daoist

waters grow shallow\" and \"the sea becomes dust-laden fields\"—all are hyperboles for their boundless longevity. From the Tang dynasty to the present, Master Lü has endured for one thousand and forty-nine years. The past recedes ever further, while the future stretches endlessly ahead. How could a mere chronicle do justice to such an age? Yet his life in the world, his retreat from it, his concealment within it, and his deliverance beyond it—all reveal the undying true spirit that spans the ages. His manifestations across the Five Dynasties, the Two Songs, the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties are meticulously recorded in the annals of immortal scriptures. Though his years defy full reckoning, we may still attempt to chronicle them, that those who revere the Master may find their senses renewed. Thus may future generations, who claim there are no immortals, come to know that immortals exist; those who deny long life learn that it is real; and those who believe immortals do not endure discover that they abide forever.\n\nThe *Chronological Biography* also records his cultivation of the self and universal deliverance, his wondrous transformations and wanderings, and the traces of his altars and sacred mountains—all to demonstrate his eternal presence. So says the Master.\n\nThe mulberry fields may shift and change, yet he remains—\nforever the transcendent one dwelling among mortals.\nThough his words may seem grand, they are no mere boast.\nThus is this *Chronological Biography* meticulously compiled.\n\n**Tang Dezong Zhenyuan (Xingyuan?) 14th Year, Wuyin (798 CE)**\n*Imperially Compiled Monthly Ordinances and Essential Records* states:\nLü the Immortal, named Yan, styled Dongbin, was a native of Yongle County, Pu Prefecture.\nBorn on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, at the Hour of Si (9–11 AM), in the fourteenth year of Zhenyuan (798 CE).\nAn extraordinary fragrance filled the chamber, celestial music drifted in the air, and a white crane flew into the bed curtains, then vanished.\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records: The Patriarch Lü descended as the ancient sage-king Huangtan. The lineage of Huangtan traces to the sovereign of the Tiji era, who ruled for 250 years before abdicating to cultivate the Dao and attain immortality in Mount Taibai. He was later confirmed as a Heavenly Immortal.\n*The Scriptures of Immortals* state: The Heavenly Lord, after enduring kalpas in the celestial palace, attended the Primordial Heavenly Worthy on the ninth day of the first month of the Tianbao era (742 CE). There, he and the Ten Poles Perfected Ones expounded the esoteric alchemy of divine cinnabar. By decree, he descended into the Lü household of Henan on the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the fourteenth year of Zhenyuan (798 CE) to revive the primordial Dao.\nHis ancestors hailed from Yongle County, Henan. His great-grandfather, Yanzhi, served the Tang as Military Commissioner of Hedong. His grandfather, Wei, ended his career as Vice Minister of Rites. His four paternal uncles were all virtuous and modest. His father, Rang, was Prefect of Haizhou. His mother, Lady Wang, gave birth to the Patriarch.\nIn infancy, he was named Shaoxian. His features bore the marks of transcendence: a crane’s crown, a tortoise’s back, a tiger’s frame, a dragon’s waist, emerald brows, phoenix eyes, a long neck with prominent cheekbones, a straight and towering nose, and a fair complexion with a yellowish hue. A black mole, the size of a jujube pit, adorned his left brow—later turning crimson. The lines on his soles resembled the folds of a tortoise’s shell.\nWhile still in swaddling clothes, Master Ma saw him and declared: *\"This child’s bone structure is extraordinary. From this moment, he will stand apart from the mundane. When he encounters reeds, he will dwell among them; when he sees a bell, he will strike it. Bear this in mind.\"*\n**Jimao (799 CE), age two**\n**Gengchen (800 CE), age three**\n**Xinsi (801 CE), age four**\n*The Mirror of Immortals* states: His nature was keen and quick. By three or four, he could recite texts and understood filial piety. Relatives all cherished him.\n**Renwu (802 CE), age five**\n**Guiwei (803 CE), age six**\n**Jiashen (804 CE), age seven**\n**Yongzhen 1st Year, Yiyou (805 CE), age eight**\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records: At five, he studied under a private tutor. For three or four years by lamplight, he mastered the classics and the hundred schools without omission.\n*His Biography* states: From youth, he was exceptionally intelligent.\n\nHe could compose ten thousand words in a day, spouting verses extemporaneously.\n\n**Yuanhe 1st Year of Emperor Xianzong, Bingxu (806 CE), age nine**\n**Dinghai (807 CE), age ten**\n**Wuzi (808 CE), age eleven**\n**Jichou (809 CE), age twelve**\n**Gengyin (810 CE), age thirteen**\n**Xinmao (811 CE), age fourteen**\n**Renchen (812 CE), age fifteen**\n**Guisi (813 CE), age sixteen**\n**Jiawu (814 CE), age seventeen**\n**Yiwei (815 CE), age eighteen**\n**Bingshen (816 CE), age nineteen**\n**Dingyou (817 CE), age twenty**\n\nAt the age of twenty,\n*The Mirror of Immortals* states: At twenty, his father arranged his marriage to the daughter of Military Commissioner Liu. In maturity, he stood eight *chi* and two *cun* tall, with a fair complexion and a smiling face, a slight beard, and a fondness for wearing a Huayang cap. Clad in a white *lan* robe with black trim, he resembled Zhang Zifang and also bore a likeness to the Grand Historian. At the Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, an inscription by a descendant of the Lü lineage—tens of generations removed—was left on the tower’s plaque, attesting that the immortal’s lineage endured.\n\nBoth *His Biography* and *The Mirror of Immortals* contain the claim that he remained unmarried at twenty and had not yet consummated the union, but this cannot be taken as authoritative. Here, it is corrected.\n\nIn the *wuxu* year (818), at twenty-one; *jihai* (819), twenty-two; *gengzi* (820), twenty-three. In the first year of Changqing under Emperor Muzong, *xinchou* (821), at twenty-four; *renyin* (822), twenty-five; *guimao* (823), twenty-six; *jiachen* (824), twenty-seven. In the first year of Baoli under Emperor Jingzong, *yisi* (825), at twenty-eight; *bingwu* (826), twenty-nine. In the first year of Taihe under Emperor Wenzong, *dingwei* (827), at thirty; *wushen* (828), thirty-one; *jiyou* (829), thirty-two; *gengxu* (830), thirty-three; *xinhai* (831), thirty-four; *renzi* (832), thirty-five; *guichou* (834), thirty-six; *jiayin* (835), thirty-seven. In the first year of Kaicheng, *bingchen* (836), at thirty-nine; *dingsi* (837), forty; *wuwu* (838), forty-one; *jiwei* (839), forty-two; *gengshen* (840), forty-three. In the first year of Huichang under Emperor Wuzong, *xinyou* (841), at forty-four; *renxu* (842), forty-five; *guihai* (843), forty-six.\n\nAt forty-six, *His Biography* states: \"During the Huichang era.\"\n\nHaving twice sat for the imperial examinations without success, *Daoist Origins Compendium* states: \"During the Huichang era, he met with disappointment in his pursuit of official rank.\" *Immortals' Mirror* records: \"At forty-six, he journeyed to Chang'an—likewise.\" Only its attribution to the second year of Tianyou is incorrect.\n\n*Jiazi* (844), forty-seven; *yichou* (845), forty-eight; *bingyin* (846), forty-nine. The above three years were spent in the aftermath of his examination failures, wandering idly in Jiangzhou.\n\n*Fire Dragon’s Transmission of the Sword Record* (*Daoist Origins Compendium*) recounts: During the Huichang era, Master Lü, having met with disappointment in his pursuit of official rank, traveled to Jiangzhou and thence to Mount Lu, where he encountered Fire Dragon Perfected, a disciple of Immortal Master Ge. His surname was Zheng, given name Siyuan, and sobriquet Lesser Zhurong. Renowned as a divine physician, he would inscribe talismans and recite incantations for the ailing, and their afflictions would dissolve at once. His lineage traced back to the ancient Zhurong clan. Perceiving Master Lü’s refined and transcendent bone structure, his heart already wandering beyond the mundane world, the Perfected transmitted to him the oral instructions for inner alchemy and self-cultivation. He forged the *Tongtian Divine Sword* (the *Tiandun Sword Method*) and composed a poem:\n\n*\"A thousand leagues to slay demons, lightning coils,\nA white dragon soars through empty skies.\nOnce wielded to sever evil spirits,\nNow bestowed to sever your afflictions.\"*\n\nAt parting, he admonished: \"You may dwell upon this mountain to complete the jade refinement. When you hear the sound of bells, you shall receive the oral instructions for the golden refinement.\" Then he departed. According to this account, the assertion in *Immortals' Mirror* that he first encountered Ancestor Zhong and later Fire Dragon is incorrect, aligning instead with *His Biography*.\n\n*Records of Marvels Verified* further states: During the Huichang era, having twice sat for the imperial examinations without success, he wandered to Mount Lu, where Fire Dragon Perfected transmitted the *Tiandun Sword Method*. Later, he encountered Ancestor Zhong, who bestowed upon him the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The sequence is thus clearly ordered.\n\nIn the first year of Dazhong under Emperor Xuanzong, *dingmao* (847), at fifty. The *Inscription at Wangjiang Pavilion in Jiangzhou* records: \"Having thrice sat for the imperial examinations without success, I wandered rivers and lakes. At fifty, the Dao began to take form.\" Some say: \"Twice.\"\n\nSome say three attempts—all within the Huichang era. The statement that \"at fifty the Dao began to take form\" thus corresponds to the first year of Dazhong (847). \"Began to take form\" signifies the initial attainment of minor accomplishment.\n\n*Wuchen* (848), fifty-one.\n*Jisi* (849), fifty-two.\nAt fifty-two, as recorded in his *Thatched Hut Memoir*: \"At fifty-two, I cultivated and attained the inner elixir, yet remained a scholar, dwelling among family and mingling with the world. I would still journey to Mount Lu from time to time.\" His *Biography* renders this as \"mingling with the world, selling calligraphy among men.\"\n\n*Gengwu* (850), fifty-three.\nHis *Biography* states: \"At fifty-three, he returned to Mount Lu’s Gui Zong Monastery.\" \"Gui Zong\" means \"to take refuge in the immortal lineage,\" intending to cultivate the Great Dao upon Mount Lu.\n\n*Xinwei* (851), fifty-four.\n*Renshen* (852), fifty-five.\n*Guiyou* (853), fifty-six.\n*Jiaxu* (854), fifty-seven.\n*Yihai* (855), fifty-eight.\n*Bingzi* (856), fifty-nine.\nIn his *Thatched Hut Memoir*: \"At fifty-nine, I lodged upon Mount Lu to nurture tranquility, visiting my parents, sleeping amid clouds and mist, studying the Three Teachings’ texts, and delighting in the scenes of a single gourd. My movements were light and vigorous, my form perfected by the Dao—all occurring at this time.\"\n\n*Dingchou* (857), sixty.\nHe traveled to Mount Luofu, where he composed a poem for the Daoist Luo Fu. The *Comprehensive Annals* records that in the eleventh year of Dazhong, the emperor, fond of immortals, dispatched envoys to Mount Luofu to summon the Daoist Xuanyuan Ji. *Luofu’s Record of Immortal Visits* (*Daoist Affinities Compiled*) states: In the eleventh year of Dazhong, Ancestor Lü journeyed to Mount Luofu to visit Xuanyuan Ji. Ji, a Daoist of Luo Fu, had received the transmission of Tong Jun and cultivated for centuries upon Mount Luofu, his countenance unaged. When Ancestor Lü sought him, Ji had just been summoned to court and was alone in Panheng Mountain. Suddenly, he encountered Ma Xian, who had come to wander. They delighted in each other’s company. Ma, named Xiang, styled Ziran, was a native of Yanguan in Hangzhou. He had met Wei Boyang, who transmitted to him the Great Dao. In the tenth year of Dazhong, he returned home and departed in transformed shape, borrowing a bamboo staff. In the spring of the eleventh year, he ascended to the Purple Paulownia in broad daylight, his spirit soaring. Thereafter, he visited Mount Luofu, where he met Ancestor Lü in person and declared, \"A great immortal elder!\" Xuanyuan Ji, returning to the mountain, passed the stone bridge and saw two figures descending from a stone tower to welcome him. One was Ma Ziran, carrying a bamboo staff and a gourd of wine. The other wore a green kerchief, a yellow robe, hempen sandals, and black leggings, bearing a sword and holding a whisk, resembling a divine attendant. Ji inquired, and Ziran answered on his behalf.\n\nThe Master Lü possessed a transcendent aspiration and a heart for delivering the world. Ji, startled, exclaimed, \"Why did I meet him so late?\" They gathered to speak from the heart, and at parting, Lü composed a poem for Xuanyuan before departing.\n\nAt that time, Ancestor Lü had not yet met Ancestor Zhong. The *Immortal Mirror* records that Ma Ziran said, \"This is the foremost disciple of Zhengyang, the Pure Yang Master.\" This is incorrect. There were two Ma Zirans: one lived during the Dazhong era, with *Ziran* as his courtesy name; the other was a disciple of Liu Haichan, with *Ziran* as his given name. The latter’s *Daoist Songs* include verses about meeting Haichan as his disciple. Later generations conflated the two, unaware that Haichan concealed himself during the reign of King Liu Shouguang of Yan, attaining the Dao between the Later Tang periods—over seventy years after Dazhong. How could Haichan’s grandson-disciple have achieved the Dao before Haichan himself met Ancestor Lü?\n\nIn the year *wuyin* (858), at sixty-one years of age, he dwelled leisurely in his mountain home. In the first year of Xiantong of Emperor Yizong (859), the *jimao* year, he was sixty-two. His *Basic Biography* states that in the early Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations. The *Record of Daoist Affinities* notes that in the early Xiantong era, Ancestor Lü, obeying his parents’ wishes, traveled to Chang’an to take the examinations. At a wineshop, he sighed deeply, \"When will I pass the exams to comfort my parents’ hearts? When will I attain the Dao to comfort my own?\" Beside him, a Daoist elder heard this and laughed, saying, \"Does the young master harbor world-transcending aspirations?\" Observing the man—wearing a green kerchief, a white robe, long beard, and elegant eyes, carrying a purple staff and a large gourd at his waist—he inscribed a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*Seated or reclining, ever with a jug of wine,*\n*Never letting these eyes know the imperial capital.*\n*Vast as heaven and earth, yet nameless,*\n*A carefree man wandering the human world.*\n\nAncestor Lü was astonished. Gazing at the elder’s extraordinary appearance and the poem’s soaring spirit, he bowed and inquired after his name. The Daoist replied, \"My compound surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, and my courtesy name Yunfang.\" Lü bowed again and invited him to sit. Yunfang said, \"Recite a quatrain for me to see.\" Lü then wrote after the first poem:\n\n*Born into a Confucian family in prosperous times,*\n*The weight of official cords oppresses, while humble cloth feels light.*\n*Who in this world would vie for fame and profit?*\n*I serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nYunfang read the poem and rejoiced inwardly. They rested together in the wineshop, where Yunfang personally prepared the meal. Lü suddenly grew weary and, resting his head on the table, dozed off. He dreamed of journeying to the capital as a candidate, passing the imperial examinations, and ascending through the ranks—from local offices to the imperial secretariat, the Censorate, the Hanlin Academy, and the Palace Library—holding every esteemed post in turn. He was promoted, then demoted, then promoted again.\n\nLü then saw himself wed to two wives in succession, both daughters of wealthy and noble families, their marriages settled early. His descendants flourished, and the household brimmed with officials—caps and tablets filling the halls—for nearly forty years. He served as chief minister for a decade, his power and influence scorching all around. Then, suddenly, he was struck with a grave offense, his family’s wealth confiscated. His wives and children scattered, he was exiled to the southern frontier, left utterly alone, destitute and haggard. As he stood in the wind and snow, his horse beneath him, he sighed deeply—only to awaken with a start. Yunfang sat beside him, smiling faintly.\n\n\"The millet is not yet cooked,\" he said, \"yet you’ve dreamed your way to the Land of HuaXu.\"\n\nLü started. \"Sir, did you know of my dream?\"\n\nYunfang replied, \"Just now, you experienced a thousand shifts of fortune—glory and ruin, joy and sorrow—all in the span of fifty years. What is there to rejoice in gain or mourn in loss? Moreover, there is the Great Awakening, after which this human world is but one vast dream.\"\n\nLü was deeply moved, realizing that fame and rank were but illusions. He bowed again and said, \"Master, you are no ordinary man. I beg you to teach me the art of transcending the world.\"\n\nYunfang demurred, \"Your bones are not yet refined, your resolve not yet steadfast. If you seek transcendence, you must wait several lifetimes more.\"\n\nLü kowtowed, pleading for instruction, vowing to cultivate good karma in this life. Yunfang said, \"You still have several years of worldly ties left to untangle.\" Then, with a light step, he departed.\n\nLü felt as though he had lost something vital. Reluctantly, he forced himself to sit for the spring examinations. His name was inscribed on the Wild Goose Pagoda, and he muttered wryly, \"Am I entering the millet dream again? Take care not to reach that moment in the wind and snow.\"\n\nIn the year *gengchen* (860), at sixty-three, he first entered officialdom. He later recalled, \"In the winter of the second year of *Xiantong* (861), I was posted to Dehua County in Jiangzhou.\"\n\nIn the year *xinsi* (861), at sixty-four, he took office in Jiangzhou. There, he again encountered Master Zhongli. Chen Shangyang recorded: \"Having passed the imperial examinations, he was appointed magistrate of Dehua County in Jiangzhou. One day, he wandered freely on Mount Lu, strolling along the Li River. There, he met the Perfected One of Zhengyang, who transmitted the Dao to him.\" *Record of Entering Zhongnan* states: \"In the third year of *Xiantong* (862), Lü served as magistrate of Dehua County in Jiangzhou. In the scorching sixth month, he sought refuge from the heat on Mount Lu. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a bell, and Master Zhong emerged from the mountains. Knowing his time had come, he sought guidance on the path ahead. Master Zhong sat with him in the forest and imparted the wondrous principles of the Golden Elixir, instructing him to resign from office, return home, and enter Zhongnan Mountain without delay. Lü immediately removed his official cap and resigned, choosing an auspicious day in the tenth month to follow his teacher.\"\n\nArriving at the first tier of Zhongnan Mountain, he at once beheld his teacher’s face. Master Zhong said, “A man of true faith indeed! You have mastered the Fire Dragon method and now refine your body back to youth. At sixty-four, your hexagram qi is exhausted and returns to Heaven, restoring the Qian trigram—you may be called Pure Yang.” He added, “From this day forth, you are my companion in these mountains. I rename you Yan, styled Dongbin.” He further urged him to build a hut and sit in stillness to refine the Returned Elixir.\n\nPrivately, Lü doubted this. Three times he tended the furnace, yet failed. His heart was lost in confusion. Master Zhong said, “The human heart is not yet stilled; the firing times were not strict. You must enter deep tranquility again before it can succeed.”\n\nOne day, seated on his couch, in profound stillness he suddenly saw: upon returning to Chang’an, all his family lay dead of illness. His heart felt no grief, but he prepared coffins with care. Soon after, the dead arose. Again, he saw: selling goods in the market, the price was agreed, yet the buyer abruptly paid only half. He made no dispute, left the goods, and returned home.\n\nA beggar leaned against the door seeking alms. He gave him coins and goods. The beggar嫌ed it too little and asked again; then嫌ed it too slow, even adding insults. Lü bowed in gratitude. The beggar laughed and left.\n\nHe herded sheep in the mountains. A tiger passed by. Lü stood among the flock, and the tiger’s eyes left the sheep to fix on him—as if craving man and scorning beast. Knowing it could not be avoided, he stepped forward to meet it. The tiger released its gaze and departed.\n\nLiving in a thatched hut deep in the mountains, reading, a girl suddenly appeared—seventeen or eighteen, radiant as light, her adornments exquisite. She claimed to have lost her way returning from her parents’ home and asked to rest a while. At night, she pressed him to share his bed. Lü remained unmoved.\n\nHe returned from the outskirts to find his home ransacked—all possessions swept away by thieves, leaving scarcely enough for the next meal. Yet his face showed no anger.\n\nTilling the soil to sustain himself, he uncovered dozens of gold ingots beneath his hoe. He quickly covered them and took none. Later, in the market, he bought an old bronze inkstone. Upon grinding it, he found it was gold. He sought the owner and returned it.\n\nA mad Daoist peddled medicine in the city, claiming that whoever took it would die instantly. After ten days, none had bought it. Lü found this strange and purchased the medicine to take home. He suffered no ill effects.\n\nWhen the spring river swelled, he called for a ferry. Midway across, wind and waves surged violently, yet he sat unmoving in the boat—ultimately unharmed.\n\nAlone in his chamber, he saw countless ghosts and spirits of bizarre and monstrous forms. Some sought to strike him; others, to kill him. He felt no fear. Then dozens of yakshas appeared, dragging a prisoner whose blood and flesh dripped. The prisoner wailed, *\"You killed me in a past life—repay my life at once!\"* Lü replied, *\"A life for a life—what objection could there be?\"* He immediately seized a blade and rope, preparing to end himself. Suddenly, a rebuke rang from the void, and all ghosts and spirits vanished. Cloud Chamber descended, clapping his hands, and said, *\"The dust of the heart is hard to extinguish; encountering one with Daoist potential is rarer still. My search for a worthy disciple exceeds their search for me. I see your heart is profoundly steadfast—ten demonic illusions arose, yet none swayed you. You are certain to attain the Way. But your merit and conduct are not yet complete. I grant you the secret art of yellow and white, that you may aid the world and benefit all things. When three thousand deeds of merit are fulfilled...\"*\n\nWhen eight hundred deeds are perfected, I shall then come to deliver you.\" Lü then asked, \"Has the work of metal and mercury undergone any transformations?\" Cloud Chamber replied, \"After three thousand deeds, it will return to its original essence.\" Lü Zu sighed and said, \"To mislead people three thousand years hence—I would rather not.\" Cloud Chamber laughed and said, \"You have already advanced this far—three thousand and eight hundred deeds are all within this path.\"\n\nHe then recounted the history of his renunciation of the world and attainment of the Dao, adding that Master Ku Zhu had once prophesied: *\"Hereafter, should you encounter one with two mouths, that shall be your disciple. When you find such a person, transmit to them my method of merging sun and moon.\"* Now, examining your surname, it truly matches Ku Zhu’s prophecy. You have come to Zhongnan, yet have not entered the wondrous realm. I dwell on Crane Peak—will you follow me there?\n\nLü Zu immediately accompanied him. Beneath the radiance of stars and moon, all was still and desolate. Cloud Chamber took his hand, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at a cave. The southern gate was already locked. Cloud Chamber struck it with his iron staff, and the door swung open of its own accord, revealing a vast expanse. Ascending a high peak, they reached the eastern gate of a great cavern, where two tigers crouched in guard. Cloud Chamber rebuked them, and the tigers lay motionless. He led Lü inside to a terrace of gold and jade, where rare birds and wondrous flowers gleamed in radiant splendor, and the climate was ever spring.\n\nThey sat together upon a flat rock and drank three cups of primordial harmony wine. Presently, a maiden in azure robes appeared—her double buns adorned with golden bells, her crimson gown and jade-green sleeves trailing, her cloud-patterned slippers and jade pendants tinkling. Exotic fragrance wafted around her as she held a silken scroll inscribed in golden script, announcing: *\"The immortals have gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. They summon you to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the spiritual travels of the Five Primal Lords.\"*\n\nAs Cloud Chamber prepared to depart, Lü Zu, fearing he might not return, composed a poem to see him off:\n\n*\"Virtue and Dao so lofty—meetings are rare,\nYet now you journey east to the immortal altar.\nAt your staff’s tip, spring’s hue in a gourd of wine,\nAtop your head, clouds gather in a five-colored crown.\nThe sea-turtle’s child drinks unseen by men,\nThe mountain-burning talisman defies even ghosts’ gaze.\nWhen you depart, this body must age—\nI beg you, grant this poor scholar a bone-transforming elixir.\"*\n\nCloud Chamber replied, *\"Simply remain here.\"*\n\nNot long after, he returned as well. Thereupon, he rode a purple cloud toward the southeast and departed. Lü Zu took the plain scroll he had been given, unfurled it, and studied it by recitation. Ten days later, Cloud Chamber returned again and said, *\"You remain here in solitude—do you not long for home?\"* Lü Zu replied, *\"Having devoted my heart to the study of the Dao, how could I yearn for the mountains of home?\"* Cloud Chamber said, *\"Excellent. I shall transmit to you the method of the Nine-Cycled Golden Elixir of the Great Return. The Dao possesses the subtlety of yin and yang. To guard yin is merely to guard the po; to guard yang is merely to guard the hun. If you can gather the hun and harmonize the po, causing yin and yang to meet, this is called the True Person.\"*\n\nLü Zu asked, *\"The hun and po dwell in darkness—how profound is this principle. How may one preserve their full measure?\"* Cloud Chamber said, *\"When wisdom arises from obscurity and the spirit abides in perfect stillness, once the spirit is merged, how could it not unite with the true? The golden form and jade substance arise from utmost sincerity. When the Great Elixir is complete, the body becomes as light as flight.\"*\n\nLü Zu asked, *\"Heaven and Earth...\"*\n\nSun and moon, the four seasons, the Five Phases, water and fire, dragon and tiger, the extraction and replenishment of lead and mercury, the inner contemplation of the River Chariot, the ten demons and nine trials—Cloud Chamber transmitted all these esoteric secrets of the perfected transcendents in thorough and lucid detail.\n\nLü Zu asked, *\"What are the signs of verification?\"*\n\nCloud Chamber replied:\n*\"At first, all lewd and wayward thoughts cease entirely, and external conduct is cultivated in tandem. When gathering the medicine, the golden essence fills to abundance, and the yin po dissolves and melts away.\nNext, the Heart Sutra wells forth, and sweet nectar flows from the mouth.\nNext, yin and yang clash and strike, and the belly rumbles like thunder.\nNext, the hun and po unsettled, dreams and sleep are fraught with alarm.\nNext, minor illnesses may arise, yet heal without treatment.\nNext, the cinnabar field warms at night, and the countenance is clear by day.\nNext, if one sits in a dark chamber, the radiance of spirit manifests of itself.\nNext, it is as if embracing an infant and ascending the golden towers.\nNext, a thunderous roar sounds, the joints open, and startled sweat flows in all directions.\nNext, the jade liquid is refined, congealing into butter as snowflakes scatter and fall.\nOr blood transforms into milk, and gradually one comes to loathe the rank and foul.\nOr the dusty bones grow light, and gradually they transmute into gold and jade.\nNext, one walks as swiftly as a galloping horse.\nNext, one remains unmoved by external circumstances.\nNext, one exhales to heal illness.\nNext, inner contemplation becomes luminous and bright.\nNext, both eyes gleam like lacquer.\nNext, white hair turns black again.\nNext, true qi is full and one is ever sated.\nNext, one eats little yet can drink wine without limit.\nNext, the spirit and body become lustrous, and essence and qi radiant and graceful.\nNext, the mouth produces strange flavors, and the nose detects rare fragrances.\nNext, the eyes perceive for ten thousand miles.\nNext, scars and blemishes vanish.\nNext, tears, mucus, saliva, and sweat all cease.\nNext, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms are wholly expelled.\nNext, the inner will is pure and lofty, and the outer realm is clear and empty; all mundane attachments fade, and both heart and environment become void.\nNext, the hun and po no longer wander, and dreams and sleep diminish of themselves; spirit is strong and qi gathered, undivided by day or night.\nNext, yang essence forms the body, and the numinous palace is fortified; neither cold nor heat assails, nor do life and death touch.\"*\n\nNext, exhalations can dry external mercury.\nNext, divine radiance arises constantly whether sitting or lying down.\nNext, in stillness one often hears celestial music—the purity of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo—unlike what is commonly heard in the world.\nNext, inner vision is like wandering in Huaxu, with the splendor of towers, terraces, and palaces—unlike what is commonly seen in the world.\nNext, one perceives the foulness of ordinary people.\nNext, the inner spirits manifest.\nNext, the outer spirits come to pay homage.\nWith merit complete and practice fulfilled, one receives the register and chart.\nPurple mist fills the eyes, and golden light envelops the body.\nOne may see a red dragon soaring or a dark crane dancing.\nColored clouds swirl, and auspicious qi scatters in profusion.\nHeavenly flowers drift down from the sky, and divine maidens descend.\nEmerging from the mundane and entering the sacred, one roams freely and naturally.\nThis is the time when the great man achieves success and attains fame.\n\nLü Zu, hearing this, was greatly delighted.\nYunfang then bestowed upon him the *Mirror of Ingredient Absorption*.\nHe said, \"With this, the gathering of ingredients and the firing times will all be clear.\"\nLü Zu asked, \"Which perfected one composed it?\"\nYunfang replied, \"It was written by the hand of Master Cui, whose name is Wang. His immortal rank is already exalted, and he is the Perfected One of Primordial Mystery.\"\nLü Zu read it and praised it, saying:\n*\"Having read Master Cui’s *Mirror of Ingredient Absorption*,\nThe mind’s ground grows ever clearer.\"*\nYunfang said...\n\nAt first, I obtained the *Three Divisions of the Lingbao Scriptures* from the stone inscriptions of Mount Zhongnan. The upper division is the *Golden Edicts of the Primordial Beginning*; the middle, the *Jade Register of the Primordial Sovereign*; the lower, the *True Primordial Teachings of the Most High*. Altogether, they number several thousand scrolls. I distilled their essentials into the *Comprehensive Methods of the Lingbao*, arranging them into the Three Vehicles, Six Principles, and Sixteen Sections. This clarifies how within yin there is yang, and within yang there is yin—the Dao of heaven and earth’s ascent and descent. Within qi, water is born; within water, qi is born—the mechanism of heart and kidney communion. By employing the eight trigrams to move the twelve hours, the crux lies in *Gen*. By the three fields mutually interacting and reverting, the crux lies in the *mud-pill*. As for the initial practice, I provisionally use the swallowing of qi and rinsing of saliva as an analogy, yet the true qi oral instructions are indeed transmitted mouth-to-mouth, not found within written words.\n\nHe further showed me several grains of divine elixir, saying: \"These are not the five metals or eight minerals of the mundane world, but are conjoined from wondrous treasures. They possess substance yet no form—like clouds, like fire, like light, like shadows. Visible yet untouchable. When ingested, they merge with one’s hun and shi into a single body, light and subtle, wondrously refined. They are not an elixir of tangible form. When your golden liquid practice is accomplished in the future, you must also refine this to carry with you. Only then can you transmute withered bones, deliver those with karmic affinity, transcend the multitudes who know no scripture, and uplift the nine clans from the dusty sea.\"\n\nHe then presented a poem, saying:\n*\"I know you are fortunate to possess a spiritually noble bone.\"*\n\nThus I teach you to embrace the heart’s vagueness,\nwithin the Water Crystal Palace atop the Hall of Containing Primordial.\nClearly I point out the cavern of immortals—\nO great man,\nwhen you encounter the true formula,\nyou must hold fast with a heart fierce and resolute.\nThe Five Phases match of themselves like the *daogui*;\nwithin lies the inverted secret of Tortoise and Serpent.\nThe Three Corpses’ spirits—\nyou must strike them through.\nAdvance and retreat by the celestial mechanism of the Six Jia.\nKnow these three essentials, and the ten thousand spirits will return.\nCome, mount the Fire Dragon to depart the Nine Gates.\nWhen the nine-nines’ Dao reaches its consummation in the day of true attainment,\nthe Three Realms and Four Palaces will celebrate the Festival of Returning to the Origin.\nQi soars aloft, the spirit blazes in glory—\nPenglai becomes my own household.\nThe assembled immortals feast amid the clamor of celestial music;\ntwin lads usher in the guest ascending to the Mystery.\nBecause your heart for the Dao does not retreat, I transmit this to you.\nWe stand in sworn covenant, tears falling in earnest.\nWhen you meet others—\ndo not speak recklessly.\nWhen you encounter friends—\ndo not reveal the secret.\nDo not fault me for repeating this warning:\ncarelessness will surely bring reckoning from the Dark Bureau.\nHand in hand we part—what is the feeling?\nToday I compose for you once more this song,\nreciting every subtle and wondrous principle,\nthough your heart may not yet believe.\nI entrust this to you with utmost clarity—\ncherish my words and ascend to the Great Loftiness.\n\nUpon hearing this, Lüzu shed all worldly dust.\nAgain he asked in full about the Three Origins, the Three Purities, the Three Treasures, and the Three Mirrors.\nCloud Chamber replied:\nThe first is the Primal Vastness of Undifferentiated Chaos,\nfrom which arises the Heavenly Treasure Lord,\nwho governs the Jade Clarity Realm of the Heaven of Subtle Purity.\nIts qi is nascent azure.\nThe second is the Crimson Vastness of Undifferentiated Chaos,\nfrom which arises the Numinous Treasure Lord,\nwho governs the Highest Clarity Realm of the Heaven of Yu’s Remainder.\nIts qi is dark yellow.\nThe third is the Dark Tranquility of Mysterious Permeation,\nfrom which arises the Divine Treasure Lord,\nwho governs the Supreme Clarity Realm of the Great Scarlet Heaven.\nIts qi is dark white.\nThus the *Scripture of the Qi of the Nine Heavens Giving Birth to the Spirit* says:\n“Though their titles differ, they are fundamentally one.”\nEach of the Three Lords serves as a teaching master, yet they are linked by a single qi—\nthey are the honored teachers of the Three Caverns.\nAs the transmission neared its end,\nsuddenly came a knock at the door.\nOpening it, he saw two men,\ntheir forms congealed in gold and azure,\nwho bowed and sat together.\nThey were Zheng Siyuan of Clear Stream and Shi Hufu of Great Flower.\nSiyuan said: “Just now we came to offer congratulations to Perfected One Yin Siyi for his elixir’s completion,\nand to visit the immortal’s gate.”\nShi added...\n\nThis attendant—who is he?\nYunfang replied: \"The son of Lü Haizhou of our dynasty. From youth he studied the Confucian and Mohist arts, his nature keen and his mind perceptive. During the Dazhong era, he encountered Master Zheng, who transmitted to him the Jade Liquid Reverted Elixir and the Heaven-Escaping Sword Method. Later, I chanced upon him in a Chang’an wineshop. With wholehearted devotion to the Dao, he first mastered the subtleties of yin-yang, refining form and spirit to enter the Way.\"\n\nShi laughed and said: \"Have both masters thus gained such eminent disciples?\"\nZheng replied with gravity: \"This is Master Yunfang’s true transmission. You and I should assist in its fulfillment.\"\nShi rose in respect and said: \"His form is pure, his spirit focused, his gaze bright, his essence concealed. If you wish to free him from the dusty net, let him present a poem.\" Thereupon, he offered a golden brush, rosy stationery, and a rhinoceros-horn inkstone.\n\nThe youth immediately presented a poem:\nThrough ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives I’ve come to this life,\nIn this life, my body at last awakens to its weightlessness.\nLeaving home and country beyond cloud-capped mountains,\nI refine my po soul and hun soul with the essence of sun and moon.\nHere I meet perfected ones who discourse on the Nine Tripods;\nI seek the Great Elixir, inquiring of the Three Clarities.\nNow, having encountered the countenance of a lofty perfected one,\nMy name is recorded at the gates of the Purple Mansion.\n\nThe two immortals sighed at his pure talent and each bestowed upon him their secret teachings before parting.\n\nAt that moment, spring birds chirped softly. Yunfang inscribed at the cave’s entrance:\n*Spring’s chill lingers in the empty sky, flower dew drips;\nThe morning sun strikes the sea, mountain clouds return.*\n\nThen he addressed Ancestor Lü: \"My audience at the Primordial Court draws near. The feathered guests of the Ten Isles will ascend to Jade Capital to report my merit and ascension by the immortal ranks. I fear you cannot long remain in this cave. After ten years, we shall meet at Dongting.\"\n\nTaking up his brush, he wrote in cursive on the cave’s stone wall:\n*By day, lofty and bright;\nBy night, the moon full and clear.\nYin and yang, hun and po souls,\nMerge and ascend together.*\n\nSuddenly, two immortals appeared, clad in gossamer robes of rosy mist, bearing in hand golden tablets and precious talismans. They announced: \"A decree from the Supreme Emperor.\"\n\nZhongli Quan, as the Celestial Envoy for Immortal Selection of the Ninefold Golden Towers, received his commission. Cloud Chamber then addressed Dongbin: \"Abide in the world to cultivate merit, and one day you too shall be as I am.\" Dongbin replied, \"My resolve differs from yours, Master. I must first deliver all sentient beings before ascending to the celestial realms.\"\n\nAt that moment, phoenixes soared and cranes danced, jade tablets and golden banners gleamed, and immortal flutes resounded in clear tones. Cloud Chamber, together with the two immortals bearing the decree, ascended upon clouds, drifting slowly away.\n\n**Renwu (862), age sixty-five** – Dwelling leisurely at Crane Summit, he composed a poem in remembrance of Master Fire Dragon and Master Zhongli.\n\n**Guiwei (863), age sixty-six**\n**Jiashen (864), age sixty-seven** – His thatched-hall records state: \"Two years after Ancestor Zhong’s departure, I resided in the Zhongnan Mountains, diligently refining the Golden Elixir of the Great Dao. The Ninefold Return was accomplished, and by the tenth month, my spirit was whole. At leisure, I took the wondrous principles of the Golden Elixir and composed them into poems and songs. This was the sixth year of Xiantong, Jiashen (864).\"\n\n**Yiyou (865), age sixty-eight** – According to the *Daoist Karma Records*, as verified by Yuandunzi and Xuanyizi, in the seventh year of Xiantong, Ancestor Lü’s Golden Elixir was perfected.\n\nUnconsciously elated, he continued his travels to Mount Lu, then to Mount Huanglong. There, he encountered Master Huiji ascending the seat to lecture. Ancestor Lü climbed the Drum-Beating Hall to listen. The master asked those below, \"Who is here?\" Ancestor Lü replied, \"A wandering Daoist.\" The master said, \"When clouds disperse and waters dry, what then?\" Ancestor Lü sighed, \"Alas for the Venerable One.\" The master declared, \"The Yellow Dragon appears!\" Ancestor Lü retorted, \"A flying sword shall sever it.\" The master laughed heartily and exclaimed, \"Hmph! This cannot be contested with mere words.\" He then asked, \"How fares your practice?\" Ancestor Lü answered, \"A single grain holds a world; half a pint pot boils mountains and rivers.\" The master said, \"This is but a corpse-guarding ghost.\" Ancestor Lü replied, \"Yet how can one deny the elixir of immortality stored in my sack? Who knows if it differs from the Buddha’s?\" The master raised his iron staff and said, \"Though one endure a thousand myriad kalpas, in the end, all falls to emptiness and annihilation.\" Ancestor Lü suddenly attained great awakening. He left behind a gatha:\n\n*Cast off the tattered sack, smash the zither to bits,*\n*The Great Elixir is not gold alone in water.*\n*Ever since encountering the Yellow Dragon,*\n*I bid all mortals seek it with intent.*\n\nHe bowed in reverence, took his leave, and departed.\n\nThe *Five Lamps Meeting* further records: Ancestor Lü once traveled to Guizong Temple on Mount Lu. Shortly after, while passing through Mount Huanglong, he encountered Master Huanglong ascending the seat. Ancestor Lü asked, \"A single grain holds a world; half a pint pot boils mountains and rivers. Pray, what is the meaning of this?\"\n\nYellow Dragon pointed and said, \"This corpse-guarding ghost!\"\nAncestor Lü replied, \"Yet how to reconcile the elixir of immortality stored in my sack? How can one know if it differs from the Buddha’s Way?\"\nYellow Dragon said, \"Though one endure eighty thousand kalpas, in the end, all falls to emptiness and annihilation.\"\nAncestor Lü suddenly attained profound awakening. He bowed again, seeking guidance, and in that very moment, realization dawned. It is said that immortals and buddhas share the same source.\n\nYellow Dragon, who tested with skillful means, was one of the Four White-Haired Elders of Mount Shang—an emanation of Xia Huanggong. Initially, he led Master Zhongli to meet the Perfected Sovereign Donghua, Wang Xuanfu. Later, he concealed his traces at Yellow Dragon Temple on Mount Lu, drawing his bow and nocking his arrow to await Ancestor Lü. His compassion was truly boundless, and those he awakened were not few. Thus, Ancestor Lü’s debt to Yellow Dragon, and Yellow Dragon’s transmission of the lamp to Ancestor Lü—enabling him to perfect the great work and return to the divine transformation—was by no means insignificant.\n\n*Record of Daoist Affinities* states: During the Xiantong era, Ancestor Lü traveled from Yellow Dragon Mountain in Nankang to Hunan, sailing across Poyang and Dongting. From Chu, he entered Shu, where he heard that Lord Fangping and Yin Changsheng still dwelled in Pingdu. He went to seek them but did not encounter them.\n\nHe then journeyed to Mount Qingcheng. Another day, he passed through Pingdu again, where Lord Fangping, upon seeing him, exclaimed in astonishment, \"A patriarch of the immortals!\" They rejoiced greatly in each other’s company. It was the year *yiyou* (865), the seventh month’s Zhongyuan Festival. As Ancestor Lü prepared to depart, he inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n*On the clear dawn of Ullambana, I passed through Pingdu—*\n*No mountain under heaven compares to its fame.*\n*Two mouths, traveling alone, unknown to men;*\n*Wang Yin’s immortal hall is most serene and void.*\n\nHe added another verse:\n*A white crane’s cry once rang from Qingcheng;*\n*Again I visited Wang Yin and my two friends.*\n*My heart longed only for the bliss of Penglai’s isles,*\n*Yet in a glance, spring had passed Dongting’s shores.*\n\n*Old Records of Wuyang* states: During the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang, an immortal master named Lü came to wander along the Jin River. He would rest in cliffside caves for days without emerging. Wherever he left traces, only his robes, cap, and straw sandals remained abandoned on the ground—no one knew where he had gone. Ancestor Lü’s poem says, *\"Once by the Jin River I shed my shell like a cicada,\"* which may refer to this.\n\nIn the year *bingxu* (866), he was sixty-nine years of age.\n\n**Dinghai (867), seventy years of age; Wuzi (868), seventy-one; Jichou (869), seventy-two; Gengyin (870), seventy-three.** Over these five years, his sagely and divine transformations reached their zenith, the time when his Dao and virtue stood most lofty.\n\nThe *Grass Hall Records* state: During the *Xiantong* era (860–874), moved by the Yellow Dragon’s revelation, he delved deeper into the labor of ten thousand fathoms. He ascended Mount Yiwulü in the north, fulfilling the great Dao of returning to emptiness. From then on, his spirit filled the Great Void, his dharma pervaded the sands of the world. The hearts of those he delivered knew no bounds, no shores.\n\nThe *Annals of Jinzhou* record: *Immortal’s Rock* lies on Mount Yiwulü, northeast of the Northern Guardian Temple. A solitary crag, sheer and towering, bears the sacred countenance of Ancestor Lü carved upon it. It is also called *Lü’s Rock*, likely the very place where he refined his spirit.\n\n**Volume One concludes**\n\n---\n\n**Volume Two: *Marvelous Encounters on Land and Sea***\n*Recorded by Disciple Huo Xiyue of Qingjiang*\n\n**Preface**\nThe ancient immortals said: *\"To deliver others, first deliver oneself; to perfect others, first perfect oneself.\"* By the age of seventy-three, Ancestor Lü’s great Dao had reached completion—he had already delivered himself. Thereafter, his life endured without end, his existence spanning ten thousand kalpas. His years need not be recorded one by one; henceforth, at the close of each reign, only a single line shall note his age, while all else is omitted. Yet the cyclical years of each dynasty, the successions of reigns, and the changes of eras must still be set forth in clear order. Only thus can the traces of his deliverance and salvation of souls be faithfully chronicled according to their times. In this way, the annals will mutually illuminate one another, and the accounts of his wanderings, manifestations, and encounters—wherever he bestowed the Dao or illumined the path—will spread across mountains and seas. The deeds and the man shall be transmitted together, truly marvelous encounters. Thus, this is titled *The Chronological Biography of Ancestor Lü: Marvelous Encounters on Land and Sea*.\n\nThe *Marvelous Encounters on Land and Sea* records:\nHe delivered the Immortal Liu; delivered Zhang Ci; delivered the Earth Immortal Shi Jianwu; unfolded the *Map of the World*; delivered Chen Jiqing; delivered the monk Huaiyi; delivered the Earth Immortal Han Bai; delivered He Xiangu; delivered the Earth Immortal Li Qi; interpreted the *Dream of Handan* for Lu Sheng; delivered Niu Sheng and Xiahou Sheng; discoursed on the Five Dynasties; delivered Rao Tingzhi; delivered the Immortal Ma and, together with Ancestor Zhong, delivered Lan Caihe; delivered Liu Haichan and He Yiyang; delivered the Immortal Geng; delivered the cowherd Huang Chengxu, who composed a poem; mourned the Southern Tang; transformed the tea-shop girl; delivered Qiao Erlang; instructed Liu Fang; expounded on the *Transfiguration of Magu*; recorded the traces of the Heavenly Consort; and appended six further accounts.\n\n**Delivering the Immortal Liu** *(Recorded in the* Daoist Origins Compendium*)*\nThe Immortal Liu was originally surnamed Guo, a fellow townsman of Ancestor Lü. Orphaned in childhood, bereft and without support, he was taken in and raised by a man of Haizhou, who named him *Jier*—\"the child entrusted to the Guo family.\" As a boy, he studied alongside Ancestor Lü, quick-witted and literate. When Ancestor Lü attained the Dao and returned home to sweep his ancestral tomb, he passed through Puyin Village in the southern outskirts. There, he encountered Guo Jier paying respects at a desolate grave. Moved by pity, Ancestor Lü took compassion on his kind heart and advanced years.\n\nHaving ingested the completed elixir, Guo Jier instantly felt his spirit clarified and his bones transformed. Ancestor Lü then composed verses at the gravesite, pinched incense, and bowed in reverence, saying, \"May all those with karmic affinity on this mountain be delivered, and may the nine clans ascend together to the celestial realms.\" He then returned home to observe his wife and children, bidding them farewell with these parting words: \"Remain here at peace. Await the day we meet again.\" Thereupon, he took Guo Jier with him.\n\nGuo had always delighted in planting willows and styled himself *Liu Qing*—\"Willow Green\"—or *Qingqingzi*—\"Green-Green Master.\" Advanced in years yet robust in body, people called him *Liu Xian*—\"Willow Immortal\"—or jestingly, *Lao Shu Jing*—\"Old Tree Spirit,\" forgetting entirely that he bore the surname Guo. Ancestor Lü then formally changed his name: Liu as his surname, Qi as his given name. In playful verse, he addressed him:\n\n*\"A fine old tree-spirit south of the city,\nClearly aware a transcendent was passing by.\"*\n—alluding to his longevity and discernment.\n\nThe Immortal Liu later recorded: \"Some claim I attained the Dao as a willow spirit—how grievously mistaken! As the scriptures say: *The human form is hard to obtain; birth in the Middle Kingdom is rare; a true master is difficult to encounter.* Moreover, Ancestor Lü taught: *After ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, one gains a human body—know that this is the fruit of past causes.* How could a mere creature achieve the Dao? My surname is Guo. I simply took pleasure in planting willows and styled myself *Liu Qing*. Through long life and enduring vision, people came to call me *Liu Xian*—that is all.\"\n\nThe *Immortal’s Mirror* states: \"Ancestor Lü walked in the southern outskirts when he saw a man seated beneath a willow tree. Upon inquiry, he learned this was the young servant Jier, who, after his master’s household declined, had hanged himself from the willow. His lingering spirit, bright and unyielding, often manifested. Ancestor Lü compassionately instructed him, bestowing the completed elixir for ingestion. He transformed his demonic appearance and set him to tending the furnace and cooking, calling him *Guo Shangzao*—'Guo the Hearth-Keeper.' This account is erroneous.\" *(See the later* Transmission of the Immortal Guo*.)*\n\n**Delivering Zhang Ci** *(Recorded in the* Daoist Origins Compendium*)*\nCi, a failed candidate in the imperial examinations during the early Xiantong era, wandered the Jiang-Huai region for years. Meeting Ancestor Lü, he received instruction in the Daoist arts. He often cultivated qi and abstained from grains, fond of wine and chess, carefree and unconstrained. One day, in Yancheng, ruffians took advantage of his drunkenness to challenge him to a test of strength. Upon seeing this, they seized and bound him.\n\nUpon sobering, he composed two poems—one extolling virtue, the other pleading his case—and presented them. The poem extolling virtue reads:\n\n*\"Our household’s fragrance ever lingers, orchid and valerian sweet,\nA clan of ancient renown, its name tied to a state’s might.\nMy bearing still as autumn’s moonlit shadow cast,\nMy prose and verse resounding like the ocean’s roaring tide.\nThe courtroom rests in peace, its zither tuned with care,\nWhy not, in the prefect’s hall, drink deep from jade cups bright?\nToday, beneath East Point Bridge, the waters flow—\nA single current, henceforth, shall remain serene and clear.\"*\n\nThe magistrate, upon reading the poem, recognized him as a man of refined virtue and moral cultivation. He then sought the essential teachings from him. Ci replied that the magistrate, as governor of a vast district, had no leisure to pursue the mysteries of the Dao. Instead, he inscribed a poem by Ancestor Lü to open his mind:\n\n*\"Why seek the Way through outward means, as if by ladder’s climb?\nLong life is found within—there cultivate your time.\nSay not the Great Dao’s hard to grasp,\nFor it is your resolve that falls behind at last.\"*\n\nThe magistrate bowed in admiration. Another day, as he prepared to take leave of the magistrate, Ci spontaneously recited:\n\n*\"Zhang Ci, Zhang Ci—he understands not,\nThough all the world’s classics fill his breast.\nHis body drifts, drifting through the mortal plane,\nYet his heart soars far beyond the heavens’ crest.\"*\n\nLater, he ascended to immortality in the lands south of the Yangtze. There, he wandered among the famous mountains. When he encountered those who set up furnaces for alchemical arts, he laughed heartily and commanded a brush to inscribe upon their walls:\n\n*\"What use is black gold sand,\nThat will not stay aloft in flight?\nThe red furnace burns the elixir in vain,\nCan it preserve the bloom of youth’s bright light?\nToday the blossoms bloom upon the bough,\nTomorrow they shall fall from branch and tree.\nBetter to drink your wine and let it be—\nWhy fret the passing years’ unyielding flow?\"*\n\nThe *Annals of Years* had earlier foretold this in a poem addressed to Scholar Zhang Ci. After returning home, the Master journeyed to the Jiang-Huai region. He tested his sacred sword, slaying a long *jiao*. Arriving at Dongting Lake, he ascended Yueyang Tower and drank alone. Suddenly, Cloud Chamber descended, saying:\n\nHaving come to fulfill our prior agreement, the Celestial Emperor has commanded that your kinfolk all reside in the grotto palace of Mount Jing. Your name has already been inscribed in the Jade Clarity Register. On the eighteenth day of the third month, you shall be presented to the True Lord of Bitter Bamboo to receive the recompense for transmitting the Method of Sun-Moon Conjunction. Gazing upon you, the True Lord of Bitter Bamboo sighed and said, “A true scion of the Immortal Lineage.” You then ascended to pay homage to the Primordial Jade Sovereign, who bestowed upon you the title of Selector of Immortals. From this time forth, you shall conceal and reveal yourself among mortals to deliver the world, your transformations beyond measure.\n\nAt that time, there was a eulogy for Junshan of Dongting Lake, recorded by the thatched hut. Before I composed the *Eulogy for Junshan*, Master Cloud Chamber had arranged to meet at Dongting. Wandering here in wait, I clasped my hands and awaited his cloud chariot, craning my neck toward the azure heavens, pacing and chanting in longing. The next day, the Master arrived and said, “The Celestial Emperor has commanded that your kinfolk all reside in the grotto palace of Mount Jing.” The following day, you again paid homage to the Primordial Jade Sovereign, who bestowed upon you the title of Selector of Immortals.\n\nAt that time, there were verses left upon the temple walls upon attending the Jasper Pool Immortal Assembly, a poem addressed to all those who study the Dao. There was also a poem composed while drunk, playfully pawning a Daoist robe at a wineshop. Another spoke of the rarity of kindred spirits, returning to the Star Islet of Mount Lu. Yet another was written upon encountering Shi Xisheng at West Mountain in Hongdu.\n\n**Du the Earth Immortal, Shi Jianwu**\nJianwu, styled Xisheng, was a native of Fenshui in Muzhou. He passed the imperial examinations in the fifteenth year of the Yuanhe era and, during the Changqing era, brought his family to seclude himself on West Mountain in Hongzhou. Retiring from the world, he never emerged, styling himself a *yuanhe* graduate and a *changqing* recluse. He once built a thatched hut on West Mountain, delving deeply into the arts of longevity. He obtained the Fivefold Inner Elixir of Zhengyang and methods for preserving the spirit, as well as the Sixteen-Character Formula of the True Man of the Great Ultimate, Du Chong: *“One spirit, wondrously existent.”*\n\nThe Dharma-realm interpenetrates, transcending all extremes. Holding fast to the center, he who aspires to sagehood guards this. Preserving his bodily form, for forty years he could not yet attain transformation. In the early years of the Xiantong era, Patriarch Lü came to visit and, seeing his inclination toward mist and clouds, transmitted to him the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir and Returning Cinnabar. Secretly cultivating it, he thereupon became a true immortal. He once composed *Chant in the Stillness of West Mountain*, which reads:\n\nLayer upon layer, the qi of the Dao coalesces into spirit,\nJade towers and golden halls daily renew.\nWere one to count those on West Mountain who attained the Dao,\nTogether with me, they would number thirteen.\n\nHis like-minded Daoist companion Li Wenying bowed to him as his disciple.\n\n**Chen Jiqing of the *Map of the Earthly Realm***\nJiqing was a native of Jiangnan. Having left his family for ten years, he sat for the imperial examinations without success. He sojourned in the capital, once visiting the monks of Green Dragon Temple but failing to meet them. At that time, an old man from Mount Zhongnan was also awaiting the monks’ return. He bowed to Jiqing and sat with him. Just then, on the eastern wall hung a *Map of the Earthly Realm*. Jiqing traced the old roads to Jiangnan and, with a long sigh, said, “How might one...”\n\nHe mused, \"Were I to drift down the Yellow River, wander by the Luo, cross the Huai and ford the Yangzi to reach home, I would not regret returning empty-handed.\" The old man laughed and said, \"This is not difficult to achieve.\" He then instructed a young novice to pluck a bamboo leaf and fashion it into a boat, placing it upon the Wei River in the *Map of the Earthly Realm*. \"Simply fix your gaze upon this vessel,\" he said, \"and your wish shall be fulfilled. Yet when you reach home, do not linger over wine.\"\n\nJiqing stared intently. Soon, he perceived the Wei River stirring with waves, the leaf-boat gradually enlarging. Sails unfurled, and in a daze, he felt as though he had boarded the vessel. From the Wei, he sailed to the Yellow River, mooring his boat at a meditation grotto’s hermitage. There, he inscribed a poem on the southern pillar:\n\n*When frost-chilled bells toll and evening winds rise sharp,*\n*Flocks of crows gather once more in the wintry grove.*\n*Here I lay down my oars to sigh and chant,*\n*Standing alone before Lotus Peak.*\n\nThe next day, he reached Tong Pass, ascending the cliffs to inscribe verses on the eastern gate:\n\n*Crossing the pass, sorrowful for my lost resolve,*\n*A thousand threads of new schemes tangled in disarray.*\n*Down the slope, my horse lacks strength,*\n*Dust coats my robes as I sweep the temple gate.*\n*Most plans come to naught,*\n*Heart and tongue ever at odds.*\n*Better to return in shame*\n*Than bear the shame of never returning.*\n\nAll he passed through unfolded as he had wished. Within ten days, he arrived home. His brothers, wife, and children knelt in welcome at the gate. In his study, he composed *Evening View from the River Pavilion*:\n\n*Standing by the riverside pavilion, sorrow fills my gaze,*\n*Years of past affairs drift like distant, fleeting clouds.*\n*Fields and gardens have scattered like floating mist,*\n*Half my homeland flows away with the receding tide.*\n*By the riverbanks, I’ll not meet the old anglers,*\n*Nor by the shores find the familiar gulls of yore.*\n*Were it not for my aging teeth and hair,*\n*I’d chant verses to distant mountains, content to whiten my head.*\n\nThat evening, he said to his wife, \"The examination period draws near.\"\n\n\"No time for long farewells—\nI must set sail at once.\"\nThen he composed a poem to bid his wife goodbye:\n\n*Slanted moon, pale with cold dew—\nthis night divides my heart in two.*\n*Wine but deepens sorrow with each sip,*\n*poems come with tears that drip.*\n*The parting song grieves the phoenix flute,*\n*the departing crane laments the jade zither’s mute.*\n*Where the bright moon kindles longing’s glow,*\n*autumn winds chill the robes I go.*\n\nHe turned to take leave of his brothers, saying:\n*\"I planned my life with no delay—\nyet fate arrived too late this day.*\n*Old friends now dwell in clouds so high,*\n*while I still wander where roads divide.*\n*After the north wind’s light snowfall,*\n*in twilight’s haze, the clouds grow small.*\n*By the clear river, sorrow clings—\na hasty race to sit for the exam’s stings.\"\n\nAfter the first watch, he boarded his boat and departed. His family wept bitterly at his leaving. Retracing his former path, he reached the Wei River’s banks. The temple stood as before. There sat the old mountain man, wrapped in coarse cloth. Jiqing bowed and said, \"As you instructed, I have returned. Was it all but a dream?\" The old man replied, \"Wait sixty days, and you will know.\"\n\nAs dusk approached, the monk still had not come, and the mountain man took his leave. Jiqing returned to his lodging. Two months later, his wife and children arrived from the south with offerings of gold and silk, believing Jiqing had grown weary of the world and come to seek him. His wife said:\n\n\"On a certain day of the next month, he returned. That evening, he composed poems at West Qi, leaving behind two farewell verses. Truly, it had not been a dream.\n\nThe following spring, Jiqing failed the imperial examination and journeyed eastward. Arriving at the Chan grotto and the Guanzhong monastery, he saw the two poems he had inscribed—ink still fresh upon the walls. The next year, Jiqing achieved fame, then abstained from grain. Entering Mount Zhongnan, he sought out the mountain man and at last recognized his true nature. Thereafter, he followed him as a disciple and never returned.\n\nThe *Records of Immortals* states: 'To awaken from one dream within another—Lü Dongbin was ever the master of such arts. The world knows the dream of Handan, yet why does none perceive the map of the mortal realm?' Here, sorrow and desolation stand in stark contrast to Handan’s bustling splendor, each stirring joy and grief to their fullest—truly a wondrous spectacle.\n\nThis account appears in the *Tales of the Marvelous*, the *Mirror of Immortals*, the *Extensive Records of the Taiping Era*, and the *Complete Tang Poems and Fiction*.\n\n**Monk Huaiyi**\n\nHuaiyi, originally from Yue, resided at Yunmen Temple in Qingzhou. One dawn, as he prepared to ascend the hall to light incense, two Daoist adepts—radiant and transcending the mundane—turned to him and said...\"\n\n\"Is there a wondrous realm you might journey to?\" Huaiyi replied, \"Indeed.\" The two then led him into the mountains, where blossoms and trees exuded fragrance, springs and rocks held serene beauty. Lotus-like peaks soared to the heavens, towering pines lined the path. Here stood jade towers veiling the sun, there layered cities clung to the void—all sights too marvelous to recount in full.\n\nAfter some time, Huaiyi felt hunger. The Daoist adepts, already aware, said, \"Mountain peaches may ease your hunger,\" and offered him one, large as a *sheng*, its rare fragrance and exquisite flavor unlike anything in the mortal world. Once he had eaten, he could tread upon waves without wetting his feet, ascend the void without obstruction. With a bound, he soared above the clouds; with a flourish of his sleeves, he hovered in the sky. Gazing upward, he beheld the sun and moon; looking down, he surveyed the Milky Way. Soon after, he returned to his former abode—yet a month had already passed.\n\nThe Daoists then said, \"I am of the Hui clan, and this is my disciple, Guo Liu. You have now wandered Penglai; you shall first attain immortality before returning to the Buddhist path.\" With that, they departed. From then on, Huaiyi no longer consumed grains. One day, he returned to Yue and recounted the tale to his parents, expressing his wish to wander afar and visit famous sites. They granted their permission.\n\nEmperor Yizong established ordination platforms, conferring precepts upon monks and nuns, and the common folk universally revered Buddhism—such was an era when the Dao was slighted and the Buddha exalted. At this juncture, Master Lü guided Huaiyi into the Daoist path, a moment akin to setting a pole in rushing waters.\n\nFrom the *renchen* year of Emperor Xizong’s reign (872) through the *bingwu* year of the *Ganfu* era’s first year (874), followed by *dingyou* (877, when Wang Xianzhi seized Huainan), *wuxu* (878, when Huang Chao captured Yizhou and Handan), *jihai* (879), *gengzi* (880, when the era name was changed to *Guangming* and Huang Chao took Luoyang, entered Chang’an, and proclaimed himself Emperor of Da Qi)—over these nine years, Master Lü girded his sword and wielded his whisk, traversing famous mountains. Among his works were poems such as *Encountering Xuanyuan Ji on the Descent from Mount Lu*, *Presented to Swordsmen and Chivalrous Men*, *Presented to the Masters of the Upper and Lower Stone Chambers of Mount Song*, *Encountering Ma Xiang at Mount Hua*, and *For Du Han of Mount Shang and Qingfu*.\n\nHe ordained Han Hanbai (not Han Xiang) as a terrestrial immortal. Hanbai, styled Qingfu, was a great-great-nephew of Han Yu. Born on the third day of the ninth month in the final year of the *Zhenyuan* era (805), he displayed extraordinary traits from childhood. He never entered the imperial examinations but instead encountered Master Xiaohongya, who transmitted to him the methods of pure cultivation. Preserving his youthful vitality without leakage, he was styled Yuanyangzi. His movements were unpredictable, his conduct untrammeled.\n\nDuring the *Changqing* era (821–824), Han Xiang passed the imperial examinations, and Han Yu urged Hanbai to study books, saying, \"Take the examinations as your elder brother did.\" Hanbai replied, \"My nephew’s aspirations differ from yours,\" and composed the poem *Green Mountains, Clouds, and Water—This Place Is My Home* to express his resolve. Han Yu, recognizing his determination could not be forced, ceased pressing him.\n\nWhen Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou, Han Xiang accompanied him. One day, they reached the Blue Pass, where the wind was biting, the snow heavy. Suddenly, the sound of a flute approached, playing before the horse’s head. It was Hanbai. Overjoyed, Han Yu took him to their lodging and still hoped to inspire him with worldly success. Hanbai merely smiled without answering. At parting, he presented a pill of medicine, saying, \"Take this to ward off miasmic poison,\" then drifted away like the wind. This occurred at the end of the *Xiantong* era.\n\nHe retreated to the mountains of Shang to refine the Nine-Florescence Divine Elixir, yet remained uncertain of the subtleties of fire and timing. When Patriarch Lü came to wander there, he entrusted him with the secret methods of Ancestor Zhong.\n\n*An Examination of Whether Han Xiang Was an Immortal*\nHan Xiang, styled Beizhu, was the great-nephew of Han Yu. Han Yu’s elder brother was Han Yan; Han Yan’s son was Han Laocheng; Han Laocheng’s son was Han Xiang. He passed the imperial examination in the third year of the *Changqing* era, was skilled in poetry and prose, and exchanged verses with the scholar-officials of his time. Throughout his life, amid the pursuit of worldly success, he never studied the Dao. During the *Changqing* era, Yao of Wugong wrote *In Reply to Han Xiang*, which reads:\n\n*Yesterday I heard you passed the spring examinations,*\n*Your name now recorded in the Ministry’s register.*\n*At thirty, you’ve scaled the highest ranks—*\n*The road ahead stretches vast and hard to fathom.*\n\nHe also wrote *Seeing Han Xiang Off to Serve in Jiangxi*:\n\n*A young man who passed the imperial exams,*\n*Now summoned to military service by imperial decree.*\n*His traveling gear includes weapons,*\n*While poets fill the farewell banquet.*\n\nHan Xiang once saw Han Yu off as he departed for Chaozhou. In the *Collected Works of Han Changli*, there are two poems titled *At the Zeng River Mouth, Presented to My Great-Nephew Xiang*, and one titled *Left Behind at the Blue Pass, Presented to My Great-Nephew Xiang*. Even Jia Dao wrote *A Poem Sent to Han Xiang*. All these are found in the *Complete Tang Poems*. None mention his unrestrained, wandering ways or his youthful affinity for rivers and clouds. This clearly shows he was no immortal.\n\nYet does this mean there was no Han the Immortal at all? Not so. The *Record of Daoist Affinities* states: Han Changli had a great-nephew named Han Bai, born on the third day of the ninth month in the final years of *Zhenyuan*. From childhood, he was extraordinary. He never entered the examination halls but encountered Zhang Yun of Lesser Hongya, who transmitted to him the practice of pure cultivation. Preserving his youthful essence without leakage, he was called Master Yuanyang. He then roamed freely, embodying the original teachings of the Dao. In the early *Changqing* era, when Han [Xiang] passed the imperial exams, Han Yu urged Han Bai to study books and take the examinations, as his elder brother Rong had done. Han Bai replied, \"My aspirations differ from yours,\" and composed a poem expressing his resolve:\n\n*A cave in green mountains, clouds, and water—*\n*This place is my home.*\n*At night, I feast on jade nectar;*\n*At dawn, I chew descending rosy clouds.*\n*I play the zither in jade-green tunes,*\n*Refine cinnabar in the furnace.*\n*The precious tripod holds the golden tiger;*\n*The mushroom fields nurture white crows.*\n*A single gourd contains the world;*\n*A three-foot blade slays demons.*\n*I can brew wine in an instant,*\n*And make flowers bloom in a moment.*\n*If anyone can learn from me,*\n*Come with me to see the immortal blossoms.*\n\nHan Yu, recognizing his determination could not be forced, ceased pressing him. Han Bai claimed he could conjure extraordinary flowers. Han Yu bade him demonstrate. Han Bai took a basin, filled it with soil, and with a wave of his hand, produced a cluster of peonies, radiant and uncommon. On the petals was inscribed a couplet in golden characters:\n\n*Clouds stretch across Qin Ridge—where is home?*\n*Snow blocks the Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance.*\n\nHan Yu asked what this meant. Han Bai replied, \"You will know in nine days.\"\n\nLater, when Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou, he passed through Blue Pass, where a heavy snowstorm blocked his way. Just then, Han Bai arrived and cleared the snow for him. Only then did Han Yu realize the meaning of the poem on the peony petals. He composed eight lines to complete it, and his traveler’s melancholy eased somewhat. He still wished to share lodgings with Han Bai, hoping to inspire him toward worldly achievement, and wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Since ancient times, many talents have served the world—*\n*Who could surpass your mighty prose, like yours?*\n*Wait until the day your merit and fame are complete,*\n*Then withdraw to recline amid mist and vines.\"*\n\nHan Bai smiled and replied:\n\n*\"The whole world is drunk on fame and profit—*\n*Only I am awake upon the Dao.*\n*One day, I shall surely ascend in flight,*\n*Piercing the autumn sky as a speck of blue.\"*\n\nBefore parting, Han Bai gave Han Yu a pill, saying, *\"Take this to ward off miasmic poison.\"* Then he drifted away like a wisp of mist. In the late Xiantong era, Han Bai was over sixty when he again met Master Lü on Mount Shang. Receiving the teachings of divine elixirs, he ascended as an immortal. Today, people know of Han Xiang but not of Han Bai (氵柏), for the two names have been confused through scribal errors—mistaking *Xiang* (湘) for *Bai* (柏). To call Han Xiang an immortal is to wrong him, for all of Han Bai’s deeds have been attributed to Han Xiang, while Han Xiang’s own deeds have been erased. Here, I present both their stories together to clarify: Han Xiang pursued worldly merit, while Han Bai was a divine immortal. *Bai* (柏) suggests the clarity of shallow waters, hence his sobriquet, *Qingfu* (Clear Man).\n\n---\n\n**Immortal He, the Celestial Maiden**\n\nThe Celestial Maiden, surnamed He, was a native of Lingling in Yongzhou. Her father was named Ying, and her mother, née Zhong, favored quietude and almsgiving. One evening, her mother dreamed of strolling along the Xiao and Xiang rivers, where she saw a woman in white silk robes standing atop a great white lotus, gliding over the waves. The woman said, *\"I am the Spirit of the Xiao and Xiang. I shall lodge in your home to briefly wander the mortal realm.\"* Her mother gazed at her for a long time before awakening, already with child. On the first day of the eleventh month in the third year of the Yuanhe era, the child was born. She refused her mother’s milk and was fed lotus-root powder instead. By eight or nine, she was graceful and lovely, fond of visiting Daoist convents, where the nuns taught her scriptures and calligraphy—subjects she mastered as if by second nature.\n\nAt thirteen, she lost both parents and lived in seclusion with her aunt and an old servant. She ate only vegetarian fare and, as her parents had done, gladly gave alms to those in need. Later, at the Nanyue Abbey, an elderly nun sought her help to restore the statue of the Life-Endowing Perfected Lord. When they opened its chest, they found two scrolls of the *Yellow Court Scripture* inside, with a colophon reading: *\"Whoever is destined, whoever is blessed—if they obtain this scripture, they shall know the joy of the Jasper Pool.\"* Delighted, the maiden saw the two *He* (何) characters and, though the words were ambiguous, took them as clearly referring to herself. She asked to exchange other scriptures for these, and the old nun readily agreed. From then on, she recited the *Yellow Court* at home.\n\nAt eighteen, she remained chaste and unmarried, taking vows as a Daoist nun in her own home. She swept the floors, burned incense, and paid homage to the Lord of Fusang. After some time, the Azure Lad, sent by the Eastern Flowery Lord, descended to her home. He bestowed upon her pills of purple mushrooms and taught her the methods of the *Yellow Court*, the *Threefold Lute-Heart*, and the *Gargling of Numinous Fluid*. She accepted these teachings, and thereafter her body radiated light, her qi carried the fragrance of orchids, and she repelled all evil while refining her countenance like jade.\n\nWhen suitors from Lingling sought her hand, she feigned madness, wandering the markets in filth and disarray. People dismissed her as a lunatic and paid her no mind. Some even mockingly called her a \"Celestial Maiden,\" which only made her conceal her abilities further. At sixty, many in her village had passed away, yet she retained the appearance of a woman in her twenties. Just then, Master Lü, traveling south through Heng and Xiang, encountered her in the market and recognized her as a vessel of the highest Dao. He gave her a peach, of which she ate only half. From that day, she never hungered again and could foretell fortune and misfortune.\n\nShe entered Zhongnan Mountain to pay homage to Ancestor Zhong, who taught her the arts of divine elixirs and dietary practices. Soon, she could walk on air, ascending and descending without hindrance. Master Lü said, *\"Your practice has now reached the Great Vehicle.\"* He led her east to meet Ancestor Shaoyang, who in turn introduced her to the Wood Lord and the Metal Mother. The Metal Mother took her back to the Penglai Gardens, where she swept fallen peach blossoms, accumulating merit until she ascended to the Azure Mist Grotto of the Eastern Sea as the True Great Primordial Lord, with the Daoist name *Yiyang*. She often accompanied Master Lü in his travels through the world, leaving behind many miraculous traces.\n\n---\n\n**Note on Immortal He the Celestial Maiden:**\nThere were two Celestial Maidens surnamed He. One was from Zengcheng in Guangzhou, the second daughter of He Tai. As a child, she followed companions into the mountains to pick tea but lost her way. At the foot of the eastern peak, she saw a Daoist in a tall hat and bowed to him. The Daoist gave her a peach, and after eating it, she no longer felt hunger or thirst. Later, she dreamed of the immortal Ma Gu, who taught her to eat mica powder. Over time, she could traverse mountains and valleys with a light body, flying as she went. During the Changshou era of Empress Wu Zetian, she was summoned to court but vanished mid-journey, leaping into the treetops. Later, she appeared repeatedly at the Ma Gu Altar in Yuzhang. The *Biographies of Female Immortals* refers to the \"Three Immortal Maidens Who Bestow Children\"—namely, the Guangzhou He Maiden, the Ethereal Maiden, and Ma Gu.\n\n---\n\n**Earth Immortal Li Qi** *(from the* Late Tang Biographies of Eminent Scholars*)*\n\nLi Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, was an old man who had obtained the Lesser Return Elixir. Though centuries old, his appearance never aged. When Master Lü traveled to Gou Rong to visit the scenic wonders of the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven, he encountered the old man among the pines and misty waters. Recognizing him as a man of lofty virtue, Master Lü taught him the art of refining the Golden Fluid Great Return. Overjoyed, the old man asked to become his disciple. Master Lü replied, *\"I am younger than you, sir. Let us be friends of the clouds and mist instead.\"* The old man said, *\"In the Dao, there is no before or after—only the higher may be the teacher.\"* He bowed deeply, and Master Lü reached into his bag to secretly transmit the teachings, then presented him with a poem:\n\n*\"In the mountains of Huayang, many are the mushroom fields;*\n*The old man of Huayang lives on, year after year.*\n*By the green pines, he climbs the tallest trees;*\n*Amid the white clouds, he drinks from flying springs.*\n*Neither hot nor cold, his spirit drifts freely;*\n*East and west he wanders, his qi flowing endlessly.*\n*When his three thousand merits are complete, he shall return—*\n*But tell no one of the grotto-heaven.\"*\n\nMaster Lü, at parting, arranged to meet him again on Mount Hua another day. (See later account.) He left behind two more poems as gifts and departed with a graceful flourish.\n\n**The Dream of Lu Sheng in Handan**\n\nDuring the *Ganfu* era, Master Lü journeyed north. He styled himself \"Master Lü\" and traveled along the road to Handan. (One version dates this to the nineteenth year of *Kaiyuan*; another to the seventh year of *Kaicheng*. The *Kaiyuan* period predates Master Lü’s birth, and *Kaicheng* lasted only five years—both are incorrect.) He rested at an inn, removing his hat and loosening his bag as he sat.\n\nSoon, a young man in coarse hempen clothes rode up on a black colt, bound for the fields, and also stopped at the inn. He shared a seat with the Master, and their conversation flowed freely. When asked his name, the youth replied, \"Lu Ying, styled Cuizhi.\"\n\nGazing at his shabby attire, Lu sighed deeply: \"A true man born into this world yet so ill-fated—how can I not call this suffering?\" The Master said, \"Your body shows no sign of hardship or illness, and your words are lighthearted. Why then do you sigh over such distress?\"\n\nLu replied, \"This is merely my lot in life—what joy is there to speak of?\"\n\nThe Master asked, \"If this is not joy, then what would be?\"\n\nLu answered, \"A scholar’s life should be one of great achievement and renown—leading armies as a general, governing as a minister, feasting from bronze tripods, enjoying the finest music, enriching his clan and prospering his household. Only then could one call it joy. I once aspired to learning, mastered the arts, and believed high office was within reach. Yet now, past my prime, I still toil in the fields—what else is this if not suffering?\"\n\nAs he spoke, his eyes grew heavy with drowsiness. The innkeeper was steaming millet at the time. The Master reached into his bag and produced a celadon pillow, offering it to Lu: \"Rest your head upon this, and it shall bring you glory, just as you desire.\"\n\nLu lowered his gaze to the pillow’s opening. Its two ends had small apertures that gradually widened, growing bright and clear. He entered with his whole body.\n\nAfter several months at home, he married the daughter of the Cui clan of Qinghe. Her beauty was radiant, and her dowry abundant. From then on, his attire and possessions grew ever more splendid. The following year, he passed the imperial examinations, donned official robes, and was appointed *Xiaoshu Lang* and later *Weinan* magistrate by imperial decree. Soon after, he was promoted to *Jiancha Yushi*, then *Qiju Sheren*, and served as *Zhizhigao* for three years. He was then appointed governor of Tongzhou and later transferred to Shanzhou.\n\nLu was ambitious in governance. In Shaanxi, he excavated eighty *li* of the Yellow River to restore blocked waterways, benefiting the people, who carved a stele in his honor. Later, he was transferred to Bianzhou, serving as *Hedong Caifangshi*, and was summoned to the capital as *Jingzhao Yin*.\n\nAt that time, the Divine Martial Emperor was engaged in campaigns against the northern tribes, expanding the empire’s borders. When the Tubo chieftains Xina Luo and Zhulong Mangbutu seized Guazhou and Shazhou, and the regional commander Wang Junchan was newly defeated and killed, the Hexi region trembled in fear. The Emperor sought a capable general and appointed Lu as *Yushi Zhongcheng* and *Hexi Jiedushi*. Lu crushed the enemy, beheading seven thousand, reclaiming nine hundred *li* of land, and constructing a great fortress to secure the strategic pass. The border people erected a stele on Juyan Mountain in his praise.\n\nUpon his return to the capital, he was lavished with honors and rewards. He was promoted to *Shibu Shilang*, then *Hubu Shangshu*, concurrently serving as *Yushi Daifu*. His reputation was impeccable, and the people held him in high esteem. However, this drew the envy of the prime minister, who falsely accused him. He was demoted to *Ruizhou Cishi* and, after three years, recalled as *Changshi*. Before long, he was appointed *Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi*, serving alongside Prime Minister Xiao Song and Pei Guangting, jointly governing for over a decade. His counsel was wise and discreet, and he was summoned thrice daily to offer advice, earning the title of \"virtuous minister.\" Yet his peers resented him and falsely accused him of conspiring with border generals in treasonous plots. An imperial decree ordered his arrest, and officers arrived at his door to seize him.\n\nIn panic, Lu turned to his wife and children: \"My family has five *qing* of fertile land in Shandong—enough to ward off hunger and cold. Why did I ever seek office, only to meet this fate? From now on, I shall never again wear coarse hempen clothes, ride a black colt, or travel the road to Handan.\" He drew his blade to take his own life, but his wife intervened and saved him.\n\nLater, through the protection of palace officials, his death sentence was commuted, and he was exiled to Huanzhou for several years. The Emperor, learning of his innocence, restored him as *Zhongshu Ling* and enfeoffed him as Duke of Yan, bestowing extraordinary favor.\n\nLu had five sons: Jian, Zun, Wei, Ti, and Yi, all men of talent. Jian passed the imperial examinations and became *Kaogong Yuanwailang*; Zun served as *Yushi*; Wei as *Taichang Cheng*; and Ti as *Wannian* magistrate.\n\nYi was the most virtuous of them all. At twenty-four, he became *Zuogong*, and his in-laws were all eminent families of the realm. He had over ten grandsons. Twice exiled to the remote frontiers, twice elevated to the highest offices, he served both at court and in the provinces, soaring through the halls of power for over fifty years. His glory and splendor were resplendent. By nature, he was rather extravagant and indulgent, fond of pleasure. His rear palace and entertainments were all of the finest elegance; the imperial gifts of fertile lands, grand mansions, beauties, and fine steeds he received were beyond count.\n\nIn later years, as he gradually declined with age, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but the Emperor refused. During his illness, well-wishers thronged the roads to inquire after him, and renowned physicians and rare medicines were sent without fail. On the verge of death, he submitted a memorial:\n\n*\"Your servant was originally a scholar from the mountains of Shandong, content to find joy in his fields and gardens. By chance, I encountered this sagely reign and was granted an official post, receiving far more favor than I deserved. I was singled out for profound grace, sent forth to bear the banner of command, and brought back to ascend the highest offices. Moving between court and provinces, I have passed through the years, unworthy of Heaven’s kindness, yet contributing nothing to Your Majesty’s transformative influence. I have ridden in a carriage meant for the worthy while wearing the cap of a fool, treading thin ice with ever-growing dread, fearing each day more than the last, unaware that old age had crept upon me. Now past eighty, my rank has reached the highest of the Three Excellencies. The clepsydra’s flow has ceased, my sinews and veins have withered, and as I linger in this feeble state, my allotted time nears its end. Looking back, I have achieved nothing to repay Your Majesty’s radiant virtue. I have squandered profound grace, and now, as I take my leave of this sagely age, my gratitude and longing are beyond expression. Humbly, I submit this memorial in gratitude.\"*\n\nThe imperial edict replied:\n\n*\"You, with your outstanding virtue, have been Our foremost minister. Abroad, you upheld the realm’s defenses; at court, you aided in fostering harmony and prosperity. For two decades of peace, it was you who bore the weight of governance. Recently, afflicted by illness, We daily hoped for your recovery, never expecting this grave malady, which fills Us with deep sorrow. Now, We dispatch the General of the Brave Cavalry, Gao Lishi, to visit and inquire after you at your residence. Strive to endure the acupuncture and moxibustion, cherish yourself as a son would, and above all, hope for recovery without reliance on medicine, trusting in your body’s own healing.\"*\n\nThat very night, he passed away.\n\nLu Sheng stirred and awoke, finding himself still lying in the inn, with Master Lü seated beside him. The innkeeper’s millet was not yet steamed, and all else remained as before. Startled, he rose and exclaimed, “Could this have been but a dream?”\n\nThe Master replied, “Such is the nature of human life’s passage.”\n\nLu Sheng, lost in thought for a long while, bowed deeply and said, “Now I comprehend the Dao of honor and disgrace, the principle of rise and fall, the sentiment of gain and loss, and the threshold of life and death. This is how you, Master, have curbed my desires. I humbly accept your teaching.”\n\nHe kowtowed twice, then entreated initiation. The Master, moved, consented and took him as a disciple. He transmitted the secret of the Great Elixir and taught him swordsmanship, whereupon Lu Sheng followed Master Lü in roaming the seas.\n\nAt times, when great turmoil arose, he returned west to the Hedong region, relocating his family to Mount Zhongnan. There, he encountered the *Poems on Retreat* by Minister Biaosheng. Hao Tianting’s commentary on Ancestor Lü states: “Having passed the imperial examinations in the Xiantong era, he served twice as a county magistrate. During the Huang Chao rebellion, he moved his family to Mount Zhongnan.” The *Grass Hall Records* recount: “During the Ganfu era, when Huang Chao rebelled, I fled with Immortal Liu to Hedong. My wife, née Liu, had become a Daoist nun at home, while my four sons made their livelihoods elsewhere. Thus, I brought her to Mount Zhongnan and entrusted her to Purple Cloud Hermitage, where Mother He instructed her. After my liberation through *shijie*, I summoned them to the Jing Mountain Grotto.” Another inscription on a small ink portrait of himself reads: “To escape the chaos, I took only my wife into the mountains with me.”\n\nFrom these two accounts, it is clear he had both wife and children, and the events were real—though the ink inscription does not mention returning home to fetch them after attaining the Dao. As for claims that his surname was Li and given name Jue, that he and his wife cultivated the Dao together, and that he later changed his surname to Lü—these are all allegorical. (See the sixth year of the Tianqi era for details.)\n\nHe initiated Niu Sheng and Xiahou Sheng.\n\nNiu Sheng was from Mount Shan, and Xiahou Sheng, styled Ziyun, was a scholar from Hezhong. With the physique of a tortoise and the bones of a crane, he bore the aura of an immortal. When the Patriarch Lü returned home, moved by their shared origins, he taught them the methods of *Fire-Entombed in the Nether Palace* and *Water-Nourished at the Elixir Terrace*. He instructed them to retreat deep into the cloud-shrouded mountains and swiftly sever the snares of the world. The two disciples bowed in reverence and departed.\n\nZiyun possessed poetic talent. Later, he secluded himself on Mount Dadi and once composed a five-character quatrain titled *Pleasure Garden*:\n\n*Green leaves and red blossoms spread wide,*\n*The Daoist scriptures are pored over with care.*\n*By chance, I transplant chrysanthemums by the cliff,*\n*And hoe through the roots of white clouds.*\n\nHere one glimpses his secluded refinement.\n\n**Chronology of the Late Tang and Five Dynasties Periods:**\n- **Tang Xizong (Middle Harmony, 1st Year, 881):** *Xinchou* (Metal-Ox), *Renyin* (Water-Tiger), *Guimao* (Wood-Rabbit), *Jiachen* (Wood-Dragon)\n- **Xizong (Guangqi Era, 885):** *Yisi* (Wood-Snake), *Bingwu* (Fire-Horse) (Wang Chao established rule in Fuzhou)\n- **Xizong (Wende Era, 888):** *Dingwei* (Fire-Goat)\n- **Tang Zhaozong (Dragon纪, 1st Year, 889):** *Jiyou* (Earth-Rooster) (Qian Liu established rule in Hangzhou)\n- **Zhaozong (Da Shun Era, 890):** *Gengxu* (Metal-Dog), *Xinhai* (Metal-Pig) (Yang Xingmi established rule in Yangzhou)\n- **Zhaozong (Jingfu Era, 892):** *Renzi* (Water-Rat), *Guihai* (Water-Pig)\n- **Zhaozong (Ganning Era, 894):** *Jiayin* (Wood-Tiger) (Li Maozhen established rule in Fengxiang)\n- **895:** *Yichou* (Wood-Ox), *Bingchen* (Fire-Tiger), *Dingsi* (Fire-Snake)\n- **Zhaozong (Guanghua Era, 898):** *Wuwu* (Earth-Horse) (Wang Shenzhi established rule in Min)\n- **899:** *Jiwei* (Earth-Goat), *Gengshen* (Metal-Monkey)\n- **Zhaozong (Tianfu Era, 901):** *Xinyou* (Metal-Rooster) (Li Maozhen enfeoffed as Prince of Qi)\n- **902:** *Renzu* (Water-Dog), *Guiwei* (Water-Sheep) (Zhu Wen enfeoffed as Prince of Liang; Yang Xingmi as Prince of Wu; Qian Liu as Prince of Yue)\n- **Tang Aidi (Tianyou, 1st Year, 904):** *Jiazi* (Wood-Rat), *Yichou* (Wood-Ox), *Bingyin* (Fire-Tiger), *Dingmao* (Fire-Rabbit) (Prince of Liang, Zhu Wen, murdered the emperor and usurped the throne)\n  *At this time, Hedong, Fengxiang, Huainan, and Xichuan still pledged allegiance to the Tang, continuing the Tianyou era for four years.* (Ma Yin established rule in Tanzhou; the Liang recognized him as Prince of Chu, appointed Gao Jichang as Jiedushi of Jingnan, and enfeoffed Qian Liu as Prince of Wuyue.

From the thirteenth year of *Xiantong* (872) to the final year of Southern Tang (975), spanning one hundred and five years, comprises two volumes. The Patriarch Lü lived through the Tang Dynasty for a total of one hundred and seventy-eight years.\n\n**Discourse on the Five Dynasties (Self-Recorded by Thatched Hall):**\nAfter the *Middle Harmony* era, the Tang realm fractured, and warlords usurped power. Historians compiled these events under the Five Dynasties, but it would be more fitting to sequence them by Later Tang and Southern Tang.\n\nIn the second year of Aidi’s reign, Zhu Wen murdered the emperor and usurped the throne—nothing more than a treacherous minister. Fortunately, Hedong, Fengxiang, Huainan, and Xichuan still upheld the Tang’s legitimate calendar. Even after the Liang’s three generations, they continued to use the *Tianyou* era—this was the doing of Hedong and Fengxiang.\n\nLi Keyong, originally granted the Tang surname, abandoned the *Zhuye* clan to return to the Central Plains. Through toil and hardship, he pacified Huang Chao and was enfeoffed as Prince of Jin. He vowed never to betray his principles in his lifetime—how loyal he was! His successor, Li Cunxu, faithfully upheld his father’s legacy and was filial by nature. Though he failed to seek out the Tang imperial clan after destroying Liang, he rightfully inherited the state treasures and was recognized as the legitimate successor of Later Tang. This is no falsehood.\n\nStone Jingyang moved the capital to Bian and ruled as a regional warlord—bold, perhaps, but hardly legitimate. Xu Zhigao established his state in Jinling and restored the Li surname. Yang Pu offered his realm to the throne of Wu.\n\nLater Tang ended in the bing-shen year, while Southern Tang arose in the ding-you year—thus the true succession lay there. Liu Zhiyuan declared himself sovereign in Jinyang, entered Luoyang, and held Bian, his power no different from mere warlordism. Guo Wei rose, and Liu Yun perished—another usurper like Zhu Wen. Chai Rong succeeded him, passing the throne to a different surname; though called Zhou, it was no true dynasty.\n\nIn my *\"Knocking on the Trigrams\"* (see *Pure Yang’s Collected Poems*), the opening line does not say \"Han’s end, Zhou’s reign,\" but rather \"Han’s fall, Tang’s realm\"—for the warlords’ regimes were transient, while Southern Tang endured. For over ninety years, none unified the realm, yet the Tang’s legacy persisted as a single thread. Instead, Liang, Jin, Han, and Zhou are lumped together as the Five Dynasties.\n\nThis I cannot fathom. The August Ancestor of Song, heeding Heaven’s mandate and sweeping away the myriad traitors—yet Southern Tang was the last to fall, and the Song’s succession from Southern Tang is plain to see. Let this be left to those who read history.\n\n**Du Raotingzhi**\nRaotingzhi, styled Liangong, was a native of Nancheng. In the early Zhonghe era of Emperor Xizong, he passed the imperial examinations and once visited Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, where he heard the sound of a flute and sought its source. There he met the Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to him the secret formulas of stillness practice. From then on, he kept his distance from wives and concubines, dwelling in serene seclusion. Later, he served as Vice Prefect of Dengzhou and died; when his coffin was returned to his hometown, it was remarkably light, for he had departed through *shijie*. The *Daoist Affinities Compendium*, *Records of the Strange*, and *Genealogical Registers* all list him as a Tang dynasty *jinshi*, yet the *Complete Book* alone records him as a man of the late Song. This is because the *Immortals’ Mirror* places his account in the Jingding era, unaware that what it records is his manifestation in the late Song, when he appeared in divine form and roamed Mount Nanyue with the Patriarch Lü—a supplementary account of his origins.\n\n**Du and Horse Immortal Maiden** (*Daoist Affinities Compendium*)\nDuring the Guanghua era, the Patriarch Lü traveled to Kuocang and passed through Chuzhou, where he initiated Horse Immortal Maiden. The Maiden, a native of Qingtian, had married into poverty yet served her mother-in-law with utmost filial piety. Meeting Master Lü, she received the arts of immortality. She would go to the homes of wealthy families to spin and weave for hire. Though her work took her a hundred *li* from home, she would not eat the soup offered there; instead, she sent her bamboo hat floating back ahead of her to present it to her mother-in-law. Recognizing the hat as her daughter-in-law’s, the mother-in-law would then eat. Her comings and goings were so effortless that people began to sense her extraordinary nature, calling her Horse Great Immortal Maiden. When King Qian Liu of Wuyue heard of her, he provided money and silk to support her mother-in-law. Soon after, the mother-in-law passed away, and the Immortal Maiden, too, departed without illness. Neighbors saw her in the wilds, saying, “I follow my master to Penglai.”\n\n**Together with Zhongli Quan, Du Initiated Lan Caihe** (from his own account: Caihe, styled Yangsu, was a fellow Daoist of mine. In his youth, he met Master Zhengyang, who transmitted to him the arts of refining jade and refining gold. In the early Tianfu era, his Great Elixir was completed. I urged him to refine the Divine Elixir further, that he might transcend the spirit and enter transformation, thereby delivering sentient beings. Later, his Divine Elixir was perfected, and he ascended at Haoliang.)\nLan Caihe was an ancient immortal of the highest rank, a musician of the era of Fuxi, who had been banished to the dusty world. Wandering and singing, he awakened the blind and deaf. He often wore a tattered indigo robe, a black water-buffalo leather belt three *cun* wide, one foot shod and the other bare. In summer, he stuffed his robe with padding; in winter, he slept in snow, his breath steaming as if from a furnace. When asked what he had attained, he replied, “Who says men cannot conceive? I alone have carried a child for ten months.” In the cities, he would beg, holding a large clapper over three *chi* long, with young and old following to watch. He sang:\n*Tread, tread the song,\nLan Caihe—\nHow long can the world endure?\nThe rosy face is a springtime tree,\nThe flowing light a shuttle cast.\nThe ancients, once gone, never return;\nThe present crowd ever more in number.\nAt dawn, riding simurgh and phoenix through the azure void,\nAt dusk, seeing mulberry fields rise as white waves.\nThe radiance of long light hangs in empty space,\nGolden and silver palaces towering, lofty and grand.*\nHis songs were many, but they cannot all be recorded here. Composed on the spur of the moment, they all bore the intent of immortals—none could fathom them.\n\nHe would string the coins he received on a cord and drag them along, scattering and losing them without care, or give them to the poor, or spend them at taverns, utterly unconstrained. After living in the dust of the world for several years, he declared he would enter Mount Zhongnan to gather and eat divine mushrooms. (This was at the urging of Patriarch Lü.) During the Later Liang dynasty, he suddenly appeared at a wine pavilion in Haoliang, where he drank to great intoxication. Hearing the sounds of reed pipes and flutes in the sky, he saw cranes descend, and mounting one, he soared into the clouds, casting down his boots, robe, belt, and clapper as he rose slowly away. (There was another figure, Master Lan Fang of the Long Laugh, a different person; see below.)\n\n**The Conversion of Liu Haichan**\nHaichan, whose given name was Cao and courtesy name Zongcheng, was a native of Yanshan. Passing the imperial examinations with distinction, he served as Controller of Lulong in Yan, rising through the ranks to become chief minister. He had long been devoted to discussions of nature and destiny, revering the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. One day, he encountered Master Zhengyang, who expounded to him the school of purity and non-action, revealing the principles of preserving the Dao and perfecting the elixir.\n\nWhen [Liu] Shouguang usurped the imperial title, Haichan remonstrated in vain, then feigned illness, relinquished his seal, and departed. He wrote a poem:\n*Three thousand souls cast from the burning house,*\n*A million households’ armed gates left behind.*\n\nHe changed his name to Xuanying and took the sobriquet Master Haichan. Traveling widely in search of the Dao, he met Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to him the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. He then withdrew to cultivate the truth, attained the immortal way, and wandered the mortal world. Far afloat on the Qin River, he refined the real in the valleys of Mount Taihua and concealed his traces beneath Qingcheng. When Chen Tuan met him, he earnestly sought the profound teachings, and Haichan transmitted to him the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir. Tuan, along with his disciples Zhang Wumeng, Jia Desheng, and Chong Fang, all received instruction from him.\n\nHaichan admired Tuan’s lofty aspirations and once visited his mountain retreat, where they discoursed for a day. In jest, he splashed ink on a rock, and it formed into lines of verse. Later, when Zhang, Jia, and Chong arrived at the mountain, each recounted that on a certain day, Master Liu had visited their homes and splashed ink to form characters—evidently, he had manifested in multiple forms on the same day. When the time came for his transformation, a white vapor issued from the crown of his head, and he ascended as a crane. In the sixth year of the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan dynasty, he was enfeoffed as Perfected Lord of Illuminating Awakening and Vast Dao.\n\n**The Conversion of Geng the Immortal Maiden, with He Yiyang**\nPatriarch Lü, accompanied by Immortal Maiden Yiyang, journeyed south.\n\nThere was a woman of the Geng clan, a native of the Southern Tang. Her nature was lofty and pure, her mind subtle and wondrous. Patriarch Lü, upon seeing her, recognized her and said, \"Master He, this one may become your disciple.\" Yiyang replied, \"The Great Dao is impartial—she must first be tested.\"\n\nAt that time, the Geng maiden had gone to the outskirts, carrying a vegetable basket and walking alone. Yiyang stepped forward in jest and said, \"Young lady, do you have any broth? Might you share some with this Daoist woman to quench her thirst?\" She replied, \"I do, but my home is rather far away.\" Yiyang said, \"Hand me the basket, and I will send someone to fetch it from your home.\" The Geng maiden asked, \"Who will take it?\" Yiyang answered, \"The basket will go on its own.\"\n\nThe maiden did not believe her. Yiyang silently exerted her spiritual power, and at once the basket floated away. In an instant, it returned, filled with the maiden’s clothing and skirt. The Geng maiden was astonished and said, \"Are you a Daoist sorceress or a transcendent immortal?\" Yiyang smiled and said, \"If this is considered sorcery, sorcery can be learned; if this is considered immortality, immortality can be pursued.\" The maiden, suddenly enlightened, wished to follow and study the arts of immortality.\n\nYiyang revealed her true form to her, and the maiden rejoiced greatly. Together, they paid homage to Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to her the wondrous methods of dual cultivation. The Geng maiden then abandoned her home and wandered the clouds. She could mold snow into silver and paint cloth into embroidery. When Master Zhu Xi saw her, he marveled at her and inquired about the Daoist arts. The maiden responded with wild, incoherent speech, and Zhu could not press her further.\n\nThereafter, her marvels multiplied, and people called her Wind Immortal Maiden. Sun Bu’er, the wife of the Seven Perfected’s Ma Yifu, had early followed Wang Chongyang in the study of the Dao. Later, she encountered the Immortal Maiden and brought her to Luoyang, where she established the Wind Immortal Grotto for her to reside. After Sun Bu’er attained the Dao, the Immortal Maiden also drifted away, never to return. She was enfeoffed as Pure Numinous and Wondrously Awakened Geng Immortal Maiden.\n\n**The Conversion of Huang Chengxu**\nChengxu, a native of the Southern Tang, cultivated stillness in the depths of Mount Tongbai. His heart was drawn to the Dao, yet his practice was not diligent. Patriarch Lü visited him and left a poem to admonish him, appending a six-line postscript:\n\n*\"I leave these few words to express my intent.\nWhen next we meet, I shall surely decide for you.\nDo not retreat from your original resolve—\ncherish it well, cherish it well.\"*\n\nAt the time, Huang was away elsewhere. Upon his return, he saw the immortal’s brushstrokes left upon his hermitage gate and was suddenly awakened. Another day, Patriarch Lü returned and took him away.\n\n**The Cowherd’s Poem for Zhong Fu**\nZhong Fu, styled Ruoweng, was the military governor of Pingliang. Patriarch Lü, wearing a headscarf and a robe of white ramie, came to pay his respects. A cowherd leading a yellow calf followed him. Standing in the courtyard, Ruoweng was struck by the patriarch’s serene and refined bearing. Pointing to the cowherd, he said, \"Daoist, can you compose a poem on this?\" The Daoist smiled and said, \"No need for my words—this boy can do it himself.\"\n\nThe cowherd then took up the brush and wrote in large characters:\n*\"Grass spreads across the wilds for six or seven li,\nA flute plays three or four notes in the evening breeze.\nReturning, he eats his fill at dusk,\nAnd sleeps beneath the moon, still clad in his straw cloak.\"*\n\nAfter they departed, all saw him carrying two jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng, \"Those were two jars—those were Lü’s jars!\" He hurried to pursue them, but they had vanished without a trace.\n\n**Lament for the Southern Tang**\nAt the end of the Baoda era of the Southern Tang, Patriarch Lü transformed into a fisherman in Jiangnan, calling himself the Returning Guest. Each day, he carried a palm-leaf hat and fishing rod, singing the *Fisherman’s Pride*, using his tongue to mimic the sound of a striking oar as accompaniment. His voice was clear and mournful, as if lingering amid mist and waves. He wandered around Jinling for over a year, yet none awakened to his presence.\n\nHis lyrics went:\n*\"In Jiangnan’s second month, the mountain paths by rivers,\nPlum blossoms scatter, spring has no master.\nA single fish has nowhere to seek—\nWind and rain,\nThe jade dragon grows scales and returns to heaven.\"*\n\nAfter singing, he would walk on, sighing. If someone offered him money, he would not accept it; if offered wine, he would not become drunk. On the first day of the second month of the Jiachen year, he suddenly died, and the people buried him. One night, a great wind and snow arose, and his grave split open—his body was gone.\n\nAt that time, Emperor Yuanzong of the Tang also passed away in his bedchamber in the second month of the Jia year. Only then did people realize that the \"second month in Jiangnan\" and the \"scattering plum blossoms\" referred to the time of Emperor Yuanzong’s passing. And they understood that the Returning Guest was none other than Lü Dongbin in disguise.\n\n*The Five Dynasties Supplement* records that Li Sheng of the Southern Tang rose from the Xu family to become sovereign. Earlier, there had been a children’s rhyme:\n*\"The carp of the Eastern Sea flies up to heaven.\"*\nThe Eastern Sea was the direction of Xu, and the carp signified Li.\n\n**The Conversion of the Tea House Maiden**\nDuring the restoration of the Tang, there was a family in Bianjing surnamed Shi who ran a tea house. Each day, they sent their young daughter to serve tea. Once, a beggar afflicted with leprosy, filthy and ragged, came straight to the shop and demanded a drink. The maiden treated him with respect and served him. For over a month, she showed no sign of weariness and even selected fine tea for him. Her father and brother saw this and beat her, but she paid it no mind.\n\nA few days later, the beggar returned, and the maiden served him with even greater care. The beggar said to her, \"Can you gather the leftover tea I leave behind?\" The maiden found it unclean and poured a little onto the ground. Suddenly, she smelled a strange fragrance and drank it at once—her spirit felt refreshed. The beggar said, \"I am the Immortal Lü. You may follow whatever you wish—wealth and honor, or long life—all can be yours.\"\n\nThe maiden, not understanding wealth and honor, only sought long life without want of material things. Patriarch Lü left her the *Fisherman’s Lyrics*:\n*\"At midnight and noon, nurture the essence of sun and moon,\nOpen and close the gate of the Mysterious Pass.\nLive thus,\nThrough all your years,\nAnd carefully refine yin and yang.\"*\n\nHe also transmitted an oral formula before departing. The maiden told her parents, who then regretted their actions, but no matter how they searched, they could not find him.\n\nOne day, the immortal returned, and the Shi family detained him. The Master said, \"This year, both the Chinese and barbarians have suffered great losses. I fear those from afar remain unenlightened and shall journey north. Urge your guests to come,\" and then he departed.\n\nLater, the maiden came of age and married into the household of Commander Guan. She lived to one hundred and twenty years, her life adorned with abundance in both attire and sustenance—truly one who attained longevity and prosperity.\n\nDu Qiao, styled Erlang, lived between the late Tang and early Song. The Patriarch Lü encountered him in the imperial capital. Their bond deepened over time, never waning. Seeing his sincerity, the Patriarch transmitted to him the method of gathering gold from water—*a crucial technique of the alchemical arts*—and instructed him to cultivate it. Erlang then abandoned fame and fortune, built a thatched hut on Song Mountain, and followed the method to fruition, thereby attaining realization. Later, he again met the Patriarch Lü, who took him away.\n\nDu Liu Fang, styled Ziyi, was a native of Bianzhou. At the beginning of the Jianlong era, seeing the realm unsettled and warfare unceasing, he grew indifferent to officialdom. Admiring the character of Tao Yuanming, he turned his back on the city, faced the countryside, and built a small hermitage called Danqiu, where he dwelt. Though his hut stood amidst human habitation, his heart remained as remote as a secluded land.\n\nThe Patriarch Lü, wandering leisurely in Bianzhou under the guise of Master Hui, encountered Fang in the marketplace. He called him over for a lively drinking session. Fang sat beside him with solemn demeanor, and together they discussed the lofty figures of high antiquity and the rise and fall of nations. The Master said:\n\n*\"Within the seas and rivers, mountains bathed in slanting sunlight,\nFlowing waters, sparks of flint, fleeting time like hibiscus—\nI have witnessed the smoke and dust of six kingdoms,\nThe winds and rains from eight directions.\nYet one who will sweep away the gloom and polish the azure sky\nMust come from the land of Song.\nWhen the age is well-governed, men of talent will arise.\nWhy should we, my peers, fret in their stead?\"*\n\nFang was astonished and said, \"At first glance, I took you for a gallant hero, but now, hearing your discourse, you must be of the lineage of Anqi Sheng or Xianmen Gao. I beg you to enlighten me.\"\n\nMaster Hui then composed a song for him:\n\n*\"Watching the six kingdoms sink and rise in sorrow,\nI take my zither and wander beyond the divine realm,\nIntent on boiling white stones amidst mist and clouds,\nYet by chance, I meet a hermit in the dusty world.\"*\n\nHe further exhorted him: *\"Liu, Liu, heed my words well—time flies swift as a bird in flight. The secret of the Eight Jewels you already know; do not wait until the leaden carriage lies shattered and empty.\"*\n\nThe poem was lengthy, its essence one of gentle yet persistent encouragement. Fang bowed and received it. After the Patriarch Lü departed, Fang retreated into the deep mountains, diligently cultivating the secret arts, and never emerged for the rest of his life.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Transformation of Magu into the Heavenly Consort**\n*(From the* Daoist Origins Compendium*: The Heavenly Consort is the water deity. Sima Guang said: \"Water belongs to the yin category, and its spirit is feminine. Moreover, 'Consort' signifies a heart as compassionate as a mother’s, matching the heavens in stature.\")*\n\nDuring the Lantern Festival in Yangzhou, an elder from Qingcheng surnamed Liu paid a visit to my thatched cottage. He claimed to have heard from the Patriarch Lü the tale of Magu’s transformation.\n\nBetween the late Tang and early Song, the Patriarch traveled south to Magu’s Altar, where he encountered Master Fangping. As they sat discussing the alchemical terrace, Magu suddenly arrived in graceful descent, her divine countenance and celestial bearing beyond description. The Patriarch Lü said to Fangping, \"The islands of the southeast are plagued by typhoons. The fierce and violent must be tempered with softness and harmony. I wish to recommend someone from the court of the Queen Mother of the West to manifest a merciful incarnation amidst the winds and waves of the sea, saving those in peril. This task cannot be undertaken lightly without spiritual attainment.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the Patriarch glanced at Magu. Fangping understood his intent and smiled faintly, saying, \"None but a bodhisattva’s precious raft could bear such a burden. Since ancient times, most female immortals have delighted in playful wanderings—blowing flutes and singing in Penglai and Langyuan, drinking wine and adorning themselves with flowers. The most accomplished among them merely traverse the sea islands to inspect the registers of immortals.\"\n\nMagu gave a cold laugh and parted her crimson lips: \"Such matters are for mortals to accomplish; it is only that there has been no place to set foot.\"\n\nThe Patriarch Lü said, \"The Lin family of Putian has accumulated profound virtue across generations—this is where the great roc spreads its wings.\" Magu immediately and resolutely pledged herself, awaiting the right conditions to descend and invest herself there.\n\nSeveral years passed. Hearing of the benevolence of Lin Pi (also recorded as Lin Yuan, the Regional Inspector) and his wife, who had borne nine virtuous sons—known as the Nine Governors Lin—Magu contemplated the surname *Ma* (麻). Removing the top part of the character (广, pronounced *yan*), she was left with *Lin* (林). Thus, she chose to be born into their family.\n\nIt was the *gengshen* year of the Southern Tang’s revival—the first year of Emperor Taizu’s Jianlong reign of the Song. On the evening of the twenty-third day of the third month, a red glow pierced the sky, and an extraordinary fragrance suffused the air as the Heavenly Consort was born. For a full month, she did not cry, so she was named *Mo* (默, \"silent\"). From birth, she was spiritually attuned, foreseeing the fortunes and misfortunes of others.\n\nAt eight, she studied under a tutor and grasped the meaning of all she read.\n\nAt thirteen, an elderly Daoist named Yuan Tong imparted to her the secret formulas of the subtle and profound. By sixteen, she glimpsed a talisman in a well, mastering transformation and the arts of exorcising evil to save the world, her powers responding to her will as though extensions of her mind. At times, she would ride the wind on spirit-journeys, soaring across the heavens and seas. At twenty, on the day before the Double Ninth Festival, she told her family: \"Tomorrow is the Chongyang Festival, and I wish to ascend the heights.\" She bid them farewell in advance. When the day arrived, she climbed directly to the highest peak of Meifeng, where dense clouds rolled over the ridges and white mist stretched across the sky. Celestial music filled the air as she rode the wind upward, leaving the onlookers sighing in awe. In the void, she met the Pure Yang Master, who approached with a sword at his waist and a whisk in hand. Smiling, he said to her: \"Sister, you have opened a new chapter—born into the Lin family, attaining the Dao in your youth. I entrust the shores of the Min Sea to your protection.\" Then he departed.\n\nThereafter, she repeatedly manifested her divine efficacy upon the seas. She was enfeoffed as the Heavenly Consort, and a temple was built for her on Meizhou Island. Whenever sailors encountered wind and waves upon the sea, they needed only to call out \"Niangma\" a few times, and divine lamps would flicker faintly amid the boundless mist and waves. Sometimes, she would appear in the form of Magu, seated upon the mast, her hair coiled into a single topknot with the rest cascading down, wielding a whisk to command the dragons, who obeyed her instantly. Thus, the winds would grow still, the waves calm, and the sails would glide smoothly across the waters. Her merit and virtue were lofty, and she attained the rank of Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign. The imperial decrees bestowed upon her through the ages are too numerous to recount. The presence of the Heavenly Consort in the Min Sea is akin to that of the Great Being in the Southern Sea.\n\nYet people know of the Heavenly Consort’s divine efficacy but remain unaware that she is the incarnation of Magu, nor do they know that Magu’s advent was made possible by the efforts of Lü the Elder, who aided the perilous and rescued the drowning. Consider her conversation with Wang Fangping—seeking one to bring calm to the world’s waters, he was busiest when most at ease, coldest when most fervent, now urging, now persuading, until Magu was moved to act. The Heavenly Consort’s deeds reveal the heart of immortals who save the world, and through Lü the Ancestor, her merit became boundless.\n\nHai Chan recorded this, and Qian Xu inscribed it. It may be read as a chapter in the annals of immortals, not merely as a tale of praise.\n\n---\n\n**Six Additional Records of Immortal Traces (all from the early Song Dynasty)**\n\nIn the early years of the Jianlong reign, the third year of the Southern Tang’s revival, Emperor Taizu of the Song encountered Lü the Ancestor in the rear garden. Lü addressed the emperor as \"Vermilion Numinous Thearch\" and conversed with him for some time, though none of the attendants could hear their words. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt to gift to him, but Lü vanished in an instant. The emperor then ordered a painter to depict his likeness on the Taiqing Tower.\n\nToward the end of the Jianlong reign, Lü the Ancestor transformed into an old man selling medicine in the markets of Chang’an, always carrying a large gourd. He gave medicine to those who sought it, regardless of whether they could pay, and his remedies were miraculously effective. When someone jokingly asked if he had the Great Return Elixir, he replied: \"I have one pill—worth a thousand strings of cash—and it is not like the herbs of the earth.\" The crowd dismissed him as mad. In the city, he would often laugh and scold people, saying: \"With money, you do not buy the Golden Elixir, but instead turn it all into clods of earth.\" One day, he shook his gourd until it was empty, leaving only one pill, radiant and luminous. Placing it on his palm, he said to the onlookers: \"For over a hundred years, not one person has been willing to spend money to buy this. What a pity! Now, I shall return it to the Red Thearch.\" With that, he placed the pill in his mouth. Five-colored clouds arose beneath his feet, and he departed toward the southeast. Only then did the people sigh in regret, but it was too late. His ascension coincided precisely with the passing of Emperor Taizu.\n\nThe *Classified Facts of Song History* records that Lü Dongbin, the Immortal, possessed swordsmanship and lived over a hundred years, his face as youthful as a child’s. Li Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, claimed to have been a court official during the Kaiyuan era, living for several centuries. He and Lü the Immortal once visited the abode of Chen Tuan (Chen Xiyi). Lü wrote on blue paper with cinnabar ink and had a young servant deliver it to Chen, who exchanged poems with him. (Li Qi appears earlier in the text.)\n\nThe *Song History* states: \"The transcendent Lü Chunyang was skilled in swordsmanship. Though over a hundred years old, he moved with the lightness of a youth, covering hundreds of miles in an instant. All regarded him as a divine immortal.\"\n\nThe *Hongjian Record* notes: \"Lü Dongbin lived over a hundred years, wielded swordsmanship, and had the face of a child. He moved with swift steps, visiting Ding Shaowei’s home. Shaowei was a native of Bozhou. He dwelled in the Huatong Valley and was as renowned as Chen Xiyi. Though their teachings differed and they never communicated, their aspirations were lofty, pure, and untainted—this they shared. Shaowei was adept at absorbing *qi* and often consumed elixirs. Though over a hundred years old, he remained robust and free of illness. Emperor Taizu summoned him to court, and he presented giant sesame, southern zhi, and black zhi. When asked the source of his vitality, he replied: 'Master Dongbin.' After staying for several months, he was sent back to the mountains.\"\n\nJiang Hui, a Daoist from Quanzhou, was of noble conduct and pure integrity. Lü the Ancestor visited him, but Jiang was away. Lü then inscribed a poem on Jiang’s door:\n\n*Drunkenly dancing and singing on the sea-bound mountain,*\n*The celestial gourd bears dew to bathe the golden elixir.*\n*Deep in the night, the crane pierces the autumn sky’s azure,*\n*A thousand miles of western wind—one sword’s chill.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: \"Written by the Master of the Supreme Palace upon visiting Master Jiang.\" When Jiang returned, he was astonished and said: \"The character *gong* (宫) with *wu shang* (无上) above it—this is Lü the Elder!\" He pursued him but could not catch up.\n\n**From *Marvelous Encounters in the Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Three of Lü’s Chronology**\n\nCompiled with reverence by the disciple Huo Xiyue,\n\n*The Traces of Immortals in the Northern Song* (First Two Scrolls)\n\nThe preceding two scrolls recorded the chronology of Lü the Ancestor, reaching one hundred seventy-eight years. Here, beginning from the first year of Taiping Xingguo in the Northern Song—*bingzi* (976 CE)—and continuing to the first year of Jingkang under Emperor Qinzong—*bingwu* (1126 CE)—are the immortal traces of the Northern Song, spanning one hundred fifty-one years. Combined with the earlier one hundred seventy-eight years, this totals three hundred twenty-nine years.\n\n**Emperor Taizong of Song**\n- *Taiping Xingguo* 1 (*bingzi*, 976) to 11 (*dingchou*, 977), 12 (*wuyin*, 978), 13 (*jimao*, 979) [Conquest of Northern Han]\n- 14 (*gengchen*, 980) to 17 (*guiwei*, 983) [Liao under Emperor Shengzong (Longxu)]\n- *Yongxi* 1 (*jiashen*, 984) to 4 (*dinghai*, 987)\n- *Duangong* 1 (*wuzǐ*, 988) to 2 (*jichou*, 989)\n- *Chunhua* 1 (*gengyin*, 990) to 6 (*jisi*, 993)\n- *Zhidao* 1 (*yiwei*, 995) to 3 (*dingyǒu*, 997)\n\n**Emperor Zhenzong of Song**\n- *Xianping* 1 (*wuxu*, 998) to 7 (*guimao*, 1004)\n- *Jingde* 1 (*jiachen*, 1004) to 4 (*dingwei*, 1007)\n- *Dazhong Xiangfu* 1 (*wushen*, 1008) to 9 (*bingshen*, 1016)\n- *Tianxi* 1 (*dingsi*, 1017) to 5 (*xinyou*, 1021)\n- *Qianxing* 1 (*renxu*, 1022)\n\n**Emperor Renzong of Song**\n- *Tiansheng* 1 (*guihai*, 1023) to 9 (*xinwei*, 1031)\n- *Mingdao* 1 (*renshen*, 1032) to 2 (*guiyǒu*, 1033)\n- *Jingyou* 1 (*jiaxu*, 1034) to 4 (*dingsi*, 1037)\n- *Baoyuan* 1 (*wuyin*, 1038) to 2 (*jimao*, 1039)\n- *Kangding* 1 (*gengchen*, 1040)\n- *Qingli* 1 (*xinsi*, 1041) to 8 (*dinghai*, 1047)\n- *Huangyou* 1 (*wuzǐ*, 1049) to 6 (*guisi*, 1053)\n- *Zhihe* 1 (*jiawu*, 1054) to 2 (*yiwei*, 1055) [Liao under Emperor Daozong (Hongji)]\n- *Jiayou* 1 (*bingshen*, 1056) to 8 (*guimao*, 1063)\n\n**Emperor Yingzong of Song**\n- *Zhiping* 1 (*jiachen*, 1064) to 4 (*dingwei*, 1067) [Liao changes dynastic title to *Liao*]\n\n**Emperor Shenzong of Song**\n- *Xining* 1 (*wushen*, 1068) to 9 (*dingsi*, 1076)\n- *Yuanfeng* 1 (*wuwu*, 1078) to 8 (*yichou*, 1085)\n\n**Emperor Zhezong of Song**\n- *Yuanyou* 1 (*bingshen*, 1086) to 9 (*guiyǒu*, 1093)\n- *Shaosheng* 1 (*jiaxu*, 1094) to 4 (*dingsi*, 1097)\n- *Yuanfu* 1 (*wuyin*, 1098) to 3 (*gengchen*, 1100)\n\n**Emperor Huizong of Song**\n- *Jingguo* 1 (*xinsi*, 1101)\n- *Chongning* 1 (*renwu*, 1102) to 5 (*bingshu*, 1106)\n- *Daguan* 1 (*dinghai*, 1107) to 4 (*gengyin*, 1110)\n- *Zhenghe* 1 (*xinshen*, 1111) to 7 (*bingshen*, 1116) [Jurchen proclaims imperial title, dynastic name *Jin*]\n- *Chonghe* 1 (*dingsi*, 1117)\n- *Xuanhe* 1 (*wuxu*, 1118) to 7 (*guimao*, 1123) [Jin *Tianhui* era]\n\n**Emperor Qinzong of Song**\n- *Jingkang* 1 (*bingwu*, 1126)\n\n[Statue of the Three Heads and Six Arms]\n\nDuring the *Taiping Xingguo* era, the Four Barbarians had yet to submit. The Patriarch Lü would often manifest in the extraordinary form of Three Heads and Six Arms, clad in a yellow Daoist robe, seated upon a yellow crane. Through his dharmic countenance, he subdued the chieftains, who admired and returned to the Central Plains, thereby ceasing warfare and nurturing the people’s livelihood.\n\nThe Three Heads: the uppermost atop the crane’s crown, the middle a lion’s head, and the lower his original visage. The Six Arms: the left holding the Flying Dragon Sword, the right wielding the Coral Ruler, the middle two hands forming the Unobstructed Mudra, the left lower hand raised in the Five-Thunder Seal, and the right lower hand inverted in the Sword Seal.\n\nEmperor Taizong commanded the Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan to propagate this image throughout the world.\n\n**Yellow Crane Tower**\nIn Jiangxia Prefecture, a man named Xin sold wine. One day, a gentleman drifted in, his robes tattered yet his bearing noble. He entered and asked Xin, “Do you have fine wine to offer?” Xin filled a large goblet with fine brew and presented it. The gentleman drank and departed.\n\nThe next day, he returned unprompted, and Xin again served him wine. This continued for half a year, yet Xin never grew resentful. The gentleman said, “I owe you much for this wine, but have nothing to repay you.” He took a yellow tangerine peel and drew a crane upon the wall, instructing, “When patrons come to drink, have them clap and sing, and the crane will descend to dance—thus shall your wine debt be repaid.”\n\nThey tested it, and indeed, the crane danced. Word spread, and nobles from all directions flocked to witness the marvel, lavishing gold for wine. Over a decade, Xin amassed great wealth.\n\nOne day, the gentleman returned. Xin thanked him, saying, “Now I am rich—would you stay longer?” The gentleman laughed, “Did I seek this?” He took up a flute and played several tunes. Soon, white clouds descended from the sky, and the painted crane flew from the wall to his side. Mounting the crane, he soared into the heavens and vanished.\n\nXin built a tower at the site of his ascension, naming it Yellow Crane Tower. Only then did people realize the gentleman was Lü Dongbin.\n\n**A Record from the Thatched Hall**\nYellow Crane Mountain was once called Snake Mountain. In ancient times, Wang Zian rode a crane into the sky, and later generations built the tower to commemorate the marvel. During the Five Dynasties, it was destroyed by war. In the early *Yongxi* era of the Song, I had the affair of the crane flying from the painting, and Xin built the tower to honor me.\n\nBefore the Tang, it was the crane’s trace of Z\n\nAmbitious in his travels across the land, he witnessed the world’s decline and sighed deeply: “The times are no longer fit for action.” After his parents’ passing, he dispersed his family’s wealth, taking only an iron pot with him as he retreated into Mount Taihua. Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou admired his noble character and bestowed upon him the title Master of White Clouds. First, he met Haichanzi, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao; then, the Master of Hemp Robe taught him the art of physiognomy. Later, he encountered Sun Junfang, who urged him to seclude himself on Mount Wudang. After a long sojourn, he returned to Mount Hua.\n\nDwelling at Cloud Terrace Abbey, he once rode a donkey through Huayin. Hearing that Emperor Taizu of Song had ascended the throne, he clapped his hands and laughed aloud: “The realm is settled from this day forth!” The emperor summoned him with a handwritten edict, but he declined, saying: “Let not the phoenix bear the immortal’s decree from the ninefold palace—my wild heart is already bound by the white clouds.” The emperor sighed in admiration without end.\n\nSecluded on Mount Hua, he styled himself the Daoist of Lotus Peak. Mastering the hibernating dragon method, he lay abed for days without rising. Lü Dongbin and Haichanzi often visited him, and Lü presented him with a poem:\n\n*The Daoist of Lotus Peak, lofty and pure,\nDwells in the Lotus Palace through the years,\nBy starlight bows to the jade hairpin’s chill,\nAt dawn the golden crucible blazes with dragon and tiger’s heat.*\n\nHe urged Chen to nurture his true nature in due time, preserving his perfection through sleep.\n\nEmperor Taizu repeatedly dispatched envoys to summon him to court. Unable to refuse, Chen emerged from the mountains and journeyed to the capital, where he concealed his true power. The emperor rejoiced and told his ministers: “Chen Tuan tends only to his own integrity, untouched by power or profit—truly a transcendent of the world beyond!” He bestowed upon him the title Master of Profound Repose and allowed him to return.\n\nLü Dongbin, Haichanzi, and the Master of Hemp Robe visited him again, teaching him the method of projecting his spirit. Chen received their instruction with reverence. When asked where he dwelled in the cliffs and streams, and in what chamber he slept, Chen smiled and recited:\n\n*My palace stands where Mount Hua soars highest,\nAt dawn I ride the morning wind through empty space.\nNo golden locks secure my terraces—\nWhite clouds seal them when I come.*\n\nIn the early *Duan’gong* era, he suddenly sent his disciples Huolongzi and Jia Desheng to carve a stone chamber at Zhangchao Valley. Once completed, he visited it and said: “Shall I return here?” Seated upright, he entered nirvana. For a full month, five-colored clouds sealed the valley’s mouth.\n\nHe lived to the age of one hundred and eighteen.\n\n**The \"Breaking the Melon\" Prophecy**\nAt the beginning of the *Zhidao* era, Minister Zhang Bo and Lü Duan served at court together. In Zhang’s early years while residing at home, a Daoist visited him. Calling himself Elder Lü, he discoursed with Zhang on the *Book of Changes* and expounded the Mencian principles of preserving the mind and nurturing nature. Thereafter, Zhang’s literary skills advanced daily. The Elder inscribed a poem in clerical script as a parting gift, its final lines hinting at the emperor’s future intent to elevate him to high office:\n\n*Success shall come in the year the melon breaks.*\n\nWhen Zhang indeed rose to the rank of Minister, and sixteen years later passed away, the prophecy was understood as the \"breaking of the melon\" into its two eights.\n\n**The Verification of the Scholar Trees**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, Wang Dan served as President of the Bureau of Military Affairs. His father, Wang You, revered an image of Pure Yang with utmost devotion. One day, the Patriarch appeared and declared: “Your family has long cultivated hidden virtue; your descendants shall surely attain the rank of the Three Dukes.” He instructed Wang You to plant scholar trees as verification. Wang You then planted three scholar trees in his courtyard. When Wang Dan was later elevated to high office and enfeoffed as Duke of Wei, the prophecy was fulfilled.\n\n**Three Drunken Revels at Yueyang**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, Lü Dongbin encountered a colossal serpent in the White Crane Mountain pool, capable of expanding, contracting, and transforming to seize human souls. Seeing this, Lü rebuked it: “Wretched creature, cease your mischief! Follow me and be sated with the blood of the world’s wicked.” He beckoned it into his sleeve, where it coiled into pliable submission—thus becoming the Green Snake Sword. Lü then traveled to Yueyang, where he drank himself into a stupor on village wine under the guise of a wandering medicine peddler. His pills, priced at a thousand gold each, went unsold for three days. Ascending Yueyang Tower, he consumed one himself, then suddenly rose into the air. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his wares. Lü smiled and said: “The Dao lies before your eyes, Penglai but a half-step away. Yet you hesitate at the trigger and let it slip past.” He then recited:\n\n*At dawn I roam the Northern Sea, by dusk the verdant Wu,\nThe green snake in my sleeve brims with bold qi.\nThrice drunk at Yueyang, none recognize me—\nI chant aloud and soar across Dongting Lake.*\n\n**The Miraculous Clay Jar**\nLü Dongbin wandered to Changsha, disguising himself as the Returning Daoist. Carrying a small jar, he begged for coins, amassing vast sums yet never filling the vessel. The people marveled at him. Seated in the marketplace, he declared: “Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall receive the Dao.” The crowd vied to toss in their money, yet the jar remained unfilled. A monk arrived, driving a cart laden with coins, and asked: “Can your jar hold these?” The Daoist assented. As the cart neared the jar, the coins clattered in one after another, vanishing entirely. The monk exclaimed: “Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?” The Daoist extemporized:\n\n*Neither god nor immortal,\nNeither art nor illusion.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields ever shift.\nThe body was never truly mine—\nWhy cling to wealth?\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding the whale through the Han’s vast expanse?*\n\nThe monk, startled and doubtful, sought to seize him. The Daoist said: “If you begrudge these coins, I shall repay you.” He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and invoked: “Return them swiftly.” After a long while, nothing emerged. “I must retrieve them myself,” he said, leaping into the jar and vanishing. The monk shattered the vessel, finding a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\n*To seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to grasp.\nWe shall meet again with a smile,\nDriving your cart along the Dongping road.*\n\nThe monk departed in dismay. Upon reaching Dongping, he suddenly saw the Daoist, who said: “I have awaited you long.” Returning the cart, all the coins intact, he declared: “I am Lü Pure Yang. I once thought you teachable, but your attachment to money proves otherwise.” The monk, filled with remorse, could only apologize.\n\n**The Coins of Guangling**\nLater, Lü wandered through the markets of Guangling, scattering ten thousand coins across the streets. When he returned another day to inspect them, not a single coin had been taken. Only three remained: one fallen in the mud, another in the grass, and the third wedged in a crevice by a well, three inches from the rim. Finally, two men drawing water spotted the last coin and fought over it. Lü, standing nearby, laughed: “Is the world’s love of wealth truly so intense?”\n\n**The Courtesan’s Lodge in Yunzhou**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, a courtesan surnamed Hou in Yunzhou operated a lodge for travelers. Lü Dongbin, in disguise, sought lodging. He departed at dawn and returned at dusk, invariably drunk, yet after a month had not paid a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea. Lü said: “Master Zhongli once told me you were fit to hear the Dao.” Hou, uncomprehending, offered him wine instead. Lü drank without cease, and Hou grew increasingly displeased. Lü then extended his arm, revealing a golden bracelet beneath his sleeve. Removing one, he instructed her to sell it for wine. Hou, lured by the gold, asked: “Will you stay the night after drinking?” Lü agreed. He climbed onto the bed and snored loudly until midnight. Hou approached the bed, but Lü pushed her away. At daybreak, he had vanished. Where his hand had touched her, her skin bore a cinnabar imprint, faintly inscribed with the character *Lü*. Hou, awakened, exclaimed: “This was Lü the Immortal! Was it not a single misguided thought in a past life that brought me to this? Has he come now to deliver me?” She cut her hair, donned plain robes, and set out to find Lü Dongbin. On the road, she encountered He Xiangu, who led her into the Zhongnan Mountains, from which she never emerged.\n\n*(To observe Hou the courtesan—like Qin Cao, who upon hearing a single turning phrase from Su Dongpo, shaved her head and became a nun—is to witness the same decisive resolve. With such spirit, she was surely destined for the Dao.)*\n\nAt the Yongkang Tavern\nIn Yongkang Prefecture there lived a man named Ni Geng, who had newly opened a tavern. Each day a Daoist would come, ascend the stairs, and demand wine. From dawn till dusk he drank over a *shi* of fine brew, yet his heroic spirit remained unquenched. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni asked for payment, but the Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed drunk. Ni sat guard over him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, took up a brush, and inscribed the wall:\n\n*Like whale-sip and turtle-gulp, hundreds of cups—*\n*Who raises the jade mountain, who lays it low?*\n*When sober, twin sleeves stir the wind of heaven;*\n*A single crimson cloud rises from the sea.*\n\nAt the end he wrote: “Composed by the Daoist of Three Mountains, Pure Yang.” With a clod of earth he struck Ni’s face, then strode out the door. Gazing northeast, he saw a purple cloud flying toward him; he strode away with great steps and vanished in an instant. When the ink of the poem was scraped away, it had penetrated several *fen* into the wall. The clod of earth proved to be pure gold. From that time the tavern prospered greatly.\n\n*Jueshou (from Liu Gongfu’s* Poetic Conversations*)*\nHuang Jue, styled Mingxian, was a *jinshi* of the Jingde era and served as a palace attendant. He was renowned for his poetry and exchanged verses with Yang Wengong, Liu Ziyi, Zhang Xungong, and Song Xuangong. Once, while seeing a guest off beyond the capital gate, he entered an inn and encountered the Daoist Lü Dongbin, who said: “Next year we shall meet in Jiangnan.” Sure enough, the following year a Daoist arrived from Jiangnan. He gave Huang seven large coins, then ten, then three small ones, along with a piece of medicine about an inch long, saying: “Each year, grind this in wine and take it; you will remain free of illness.” With these words, he vanished like the wind. Huang lived to over seventy, and when the medicine was nearly gone, he wrote a poem:\n\n*Few days remain on the calendar by my bed;*\n*Counting on my fingers, next year I turn seventy-three.*\n\nThat very year he died.\n\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records Huang Jue’s name as Jueneng and places him in the Xuanhe era, also stating that outside the Eastern Capital gate, he first met Lü Dongbin, who said: “Next year we shall meet in Jiangnan.” Later, when Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and met the courtesan Zhang Zhennu, she bathed each evening, lit incense, and earnestly prayed for liberation. He composed for her the tune *Pacing the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Later, when an official summons you to pour his wine,*\n*if he wishes to hear Daoist songs and melodies,*\n*sing my verses, and you will surely gain your freedom.*\n\nSoon after, Huang became prefect of Huzhou. When he inquired among the courtesans for one who could perform Daoist songs, none could respond—except Zhennu, who presented his verses. Huang was delighted and immediately granted her release from her register. Now, according to Liu Gongfu’s *Poetic Conversations*, Huang was a man of the Jingde era, over a hundred years before the Xuanhe era. Thus, while *The Mirror of Immortals* is rich in its accounts, its chronology remains unclear. One might wish to collate and verify these records, treating them as a chronicle from within the gourd, though this remains an unfulfilled aspiration. The compilers of *The Mirror* also intended to establish a clear chronology, but in doing so, they necessarily drew on old precedents to link events. In truth, the official who enjoyed Daoist songs was another prefect, not Huang. The compilers, misled by the phrase “meeting in Jiangnan,” conflated Huang Jue’s service in Jiangnan with the Xuanhe-era prefect of Wuxing.\n\n*Du Guo’s Kitchen Service (from* Records of the Strange*)*\nDuring the Tianxi era, a man named Guo Shangzao worked as a kitchen servant, scalding water and washing dishes at a tea shop by the Bianzhou Bridge. One day he met the Daoist Lü Dongbin and followed him for over a decade before returning. He said to Magistrate Zhao: “My allotted time is nearly spent. I beg you to provide a small coffin, and bore a hole in its head, inserting a bamboo tube to allow the passage of qi.” The magistrate laughed: “Once dead, how can there still be qi?” Guo did not reply. The next day he drew water to bathe, then lay beneath a scholar tree and died. He was buried by the riverbank. That autumn, the waters rose, and when Zhao went to inspect the grave, he retrieved the coffin—empty.\n\n(Guo was an unnamed kitchen servant, hence the name “Shangzao.” From this it is clear he was no willow immortal.)\n\nDing Wei’s Encounter with an Immortal\nWhen Ding Wei served as vice-magistrate of Poyang, a scholar called on him and said: “I am the grandson of the Tang dynasty minister Lü. I am well-versed in the classics, histories, and all schools of thought. Observing your appearance, you resemble Li Deyu. In the future, your rise and fall will mirror his.” Later, Ding Wei indeed rose to high office, but was demoted to assistant magistrate of Yazhou after being implicated in a scandal involving a female shaman—truly resembling Zhaorong.\n\nThe Monk of Dayun Monastery\nLü Dongbin once disguised himself as the recluse Hui and visited Dayun Monastery. He joined the communal meals in the refectory and remained for over a month without tiring of them. He then said to the abbot: “Your meals are exquisite, save for the lack of noodles.” He departed, but returned ten days later with a small portion of flour. After steaming several hundred buns, all the monks were sated, much to their astonishment. The abbot then prepared fine tea and invited the recluse to share it. By chance, he recited a line from Ding Wei’s poetry: *“Flowers part as the monk’s chopsticks break them; clouds follow the guest’s bowl, rounding it.”* The recluse remarked: “Though this line is fine, it does not fully capture the essence of tea.” He then inscribed a regulated verse:\n\n*A jade bud, a single shoot—peerless in rank,\nThe monks’ craft demands the utmost skill.\nRabbit-fur bowls, shallow, fragrant, white as clouds,\nShrimp-eye bubbles churn, red ripples swirl.\nBanishing sleep demons from desk and mat,\nAugmenting pure qi to permeate the flesh.\nHidden groves fall beyond mountain streams—\nUnwilling to transplant their roots to the capital.*\n\nThe monks marveled at its refined beauty. The recluse then gifted the abbot a pellet of elixir, saying: “Take this, and you will not die.” Later, he ascended as an immortal.\n\nThe Receding Tides of Taizhou\n\nDuring the Ganxing era, Xia Song served as an administrative aide in Taizhou. When torrential floods surged, he led his subordinates in prayer atop a mountain peak. Suddenly, a Daoist in yellow robes appeared, striding through the rain without his garments growing damp. Fixing his gaze on Song, he said: “Should you cultivate the Dao, you may ascend to the register of perfected beings.” Song made no reply. The Daoist smiled and added: “Yet you shall also rise to the highest ranks of the imperial court.” With that, he departed, and the waters receded in his wake. This was Lü Dongbin, who, en route to Jiangzhou, had taken note of Song’s sincerity and thus revealed himself to him. Later, Song indeed attained the position of Grand Councilor.\n\n**Releasing the Dead Fish**\nIn the early Tiansheng reign, Lü Dongbin visited a wineshop on Mount Lu. There, he saw a fish being scaled for minced fish. He said: “I can restore this fish to life.” The scaler replied: “If you can revive it, I shall release it.” The Master then placed a pellet of elixir into the fish’s belly. In an instant, the fish flipped and thrashed. Startled, the scaler cast it into the river, where it swam away with ease. As he turned to ask the Master’s name, a gust of wind passed, and Lü vanished—leaving only two circles traced upon the ground.",

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the Woodblock Edition of the *Chronological Biography of Patriarch Lü*, Preserved in Kongqing Grotto-Heaven**\n\nLong ago, Patriarch Lü wandered to the Grass Hall by the Northern Sea of Lu Immortal, manifesting his form to expound the Dao and deliver sentient beings, leaving behind several dozen entries recorded by Elder Guest as if conversing in an ordinary household. Herein lie traces of both worldly engagement and transcendence, stirring those who dwell in hidden emptiness, that they may know the weight of their immortal roots, the rarity of encountering the true Dao, the futility of clinging to fame and rank, and the folly of coveting worldly affairs. Why roam the maps of the earth again? Why dream the yellow millet dream anew? Such is the teaching embodied in his person.\n\nUpon close examination of his intent, one finds it more unburdened than that of Lu Sheng or Chen Sheng. I, Yue Sheng, though foolish, read the *Biographies of the Immortals* in my youth and took an immediate fondness for Patriarch Lü, as if bound to him by a predestined affinity. Later, upon reading the play script of Handan, I composed a poem:\n\n*\"The desire for fame chilled ten years ago,\nI sought to outdo Lu Sheng in one move.\nRather than dream of yellow millet and noble rank,\nI’d take up lute and sword to learn the immortal’s way.\"*\n\nThis was my own awakening, requiring no labored persuasion from the Master.\n\nOne day, entering a temple to view ancient paintings, I saw a figure with a blue headscarf, a black sash, a flute at the waist, and a whisk in hand—recognizing it as the true likeness of Patriarch Lü. I sought it out and enshrined it. Soon after, I obtained the *Complete Works of Han San*, and upon opening the scroll, I attained great enlightenment: the work of immortals lies within oneself, not in the three mountains of Penglai.\n\nBurning incense and bowing in reverence, I vowed to uphold the true teaching. Thereafter, whenever I studied the Patriarch’s deeds, I recorded the places, times, and circumstances of his deliverance of others—not as formal biographies, but as accounts. All this was to express my devotion to saving the world, with precision, detail, rigor, and care.\n\nWhat remained unsatisfactory was the inconsistency in immortal texts regarding the facts of Patriarch Lü’s birth, cultivation, and emergence. Though I longed to verify the truth, my limited understanding left the matter unresolved. Finally, I obtained *The Record of Daoist Affinities with Immortal Lu of Huaihai* and *Elder Guest’s Personal Records*. Amidst the clamor of conflicting accounts, the truth at last became clear. Bowing before the seat of the Master, I now respectfully present this *Chronological Biography*.\n\n---",

      "translated_text": "Upon the completion of this *Chronological Biography*, an elderly man with five long strands of beard, who styled himself Master Wushan, arrived. Accompanying him was a refined scholar from Yangzhou, and together they claimed to be from the southern regions. Their voices resonant as great bells, they perused the *Chronological Biography* with delight. The elder declared that he had grasped the true essence of Patriarch Lü’s teachings and proceeded to add several dozen marginal notes before vanishing without a trace. At the time, I had just kindled the stove to brew wine, intending to await the visit of a reclusive guest—yet by the time I turned to greet them, they had already disappeared without a trace.\n\nSome speculate that \"Wushan\" signifies \"five mouths, one mountain,\" while \"southern regions\" refers to the language of the immortals dwelling atop Zhongnan Peak. Moreover, given the sobriquet \"Lü of the Southern Regions\" in certain texts, this elder must have been none other than Master Lü himself. As for the refined scholar from Yangzhou, could he have been the immortal Lu of Huaihai?\n\n**Nine Principles of Compilation:**\n\n1. This *Chronological Biography* prioritizes factual accuracy. Previous accounts have varied widely; this edition takes *The Master’s Personal Records from the Thatched Hall* and *The Record of Daoist Affinities* as its primary sources, for these were received firsthand and thus hold greater veracity than other versions.\n\n2. Patriarch Lü often engaged in playful transformations, leaving his surname, native place, birth year, month, and day ever-shifting—much like the allegorical language of alchemical texts.\n\n3. Though *Dragon Sands* became widely circulated only in the Ming and Qing dynasties, its contents are highly selective. As Patriarch Lü once said: \"In a single day, I attend three thousand grand assemblies, yet of the hundreds of altars, only one or two are chosen. Even among those, only a few individuals are selected.\" This reflects the utmost rigor in verification.\n\n4. *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* records many instances of deliverance, and the deeds of figures like Han, He, Cao, and Lan often parallel those of Patriarch Lü, albeit with discrepancies. This edition provides detailed distinctions, clearly separating the traces of master and disciples.\n\n5. Those delivered by Patriarch Lü were all individuals of genuine merit, as attested in ancient texts, with few omissions. As for his myriad manifestations, these represent but one in ten thousand—let the discerning reader take note.\n\n6. Though figures such as Xiao Dongxuan and Wang Chang are recognized by *The Register of Divine Immortals* as disciples of Patriarch Lü, *The Extensive Records of the Taiping Era* places them in the pre-Zhenyuan period. This edition refrains from including them.\n\n7. *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* and *The Collected Poems* mutually elucidate one another: where the poems are brief, *Marvelous Encounters* provides detail, and where the poems are thorough, *Marvelous Encounters* does not repeat.\n\n8. Some entries in *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain* overlap with the prefaces to the poems, but as this is a chronological compilation, repetition is unavoidable.\n\n9. This work emphasizes the correlation of events with their dates. Where it corrects errors in the annals of divine immortals, any omissions or inadequacies may be supplemented by scholars of antiquity.\n\n*[The above excerpted from *Mystic Threads of Daoist Records*]*\n\n**General Contents of *Chronological Biography of Patriarch Lü: Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain and Traces of Divine Immortals***\n\n**Volume One: Chronological Biography** *(covering seventy-three years, containing six records)*\n- *The Transmission of the Fire Dragon Sword*\n- *Visiting Immortals at Luofu*\n- *The Yellow Millet Dream*\n- *Entering Zhongnan*\n- *Meeting the Yellow Dragon*\n- *Wandering Mount Pingdu*\n\n**Volume Two** *(Tang Dynasty, covering one hundred and five years)*\n- Deliverance of the Willow Immortal\n- Deliverance of Zhang Ci\n- Deliverance of Shi Jianwu\n- *The Map of the World’s Deliverance*: Deliverance of Chen Jiqing\n- Deliverance of Monk Huaiyi\n- Deliverance of Han Mo *(Note: \"Mo\" is here corrected from \"Xiang\"; appended: \"An Examination of Whether Han Xiang Was an Immortal\")*\n- Deliverance of He Xiangu *(Appended: \"An Examination of He Xiangu of Zengcheng, Guangzhou\")*\n- Deliverance of Li Qi\n- *The Handan Dream*: Deliverance of Lu Sheng",

The lineage of Huangtan traces to the sovereign of the Tiji era, who ruled for 250 years before abdicating to cultivate the Dao and attain immortality in Mount Taibai. He was later confirmed as a Heavenly Immortal.\n*The Scriptures of Immortals* state: The Heavenly Lord, after enduring kalpas in the celestial palace, attended the Primordial Heavenly Worthy on the ninth day of the first month of the Tianbao era (742 CE). There, he and the Ten Poles Perfected Ones expounded the esoteric alchemy of divine cinnabar. By decree, he descended into the Lü household of Henan on the fourteenth day of the fourth month of the fourteenth year of Zhenyuan (798 CE) to revive the primordial Dao.\nHis ancestors hailed from Yongle County, Henan. His great-grandfather, Yanzhi, served the Tang as Military Commissioner of Hedong. His grandfather, Wei, ended his career as Vice Minister of Rites. His four paternal uncles were all virtuous and modest. His father, Rang, was Prefect of Haizhou. His mother, Lady Wang, gave birth to the Patriarch.\nIn infancy, he was named Shaoxian. His features bore the marks of transcendence: a crane’s crown, a tortoise’s back, a tiger’s frame, a dragon’s waist, emerald brows, phoenix eyes, a long neck with prominent cheekbones, a straight and towering nose, and a fair complexion with a yellowish hue. A black mole, the size of a jujube pit, adorned his left brow—later turning crimson. The lines on his soles resembled the folds of a tortoise’s shell.\nWhile still in swaddling clothes, Master Ma saw him and declared: *\"This child’s bone structure is extraordinary. From this moment, he will stand apart from the mundane. When he encounters reeds, he will dwell among them; when he sees a bell, he will strike it. Bear this in mind.\"*\n**Jimao (799 CE), age two**\n**Gengchen (800 CE), age three**\n**Xinsi (801 CE), age four**\n*The Mirror of Immortals* states: His nature was keen and quick. By three or four, he could recite texts and understood filial piety.

The above three years were spent in the aftermath of his examination failures, wandering idly in Jiangzhou.\n\n*Fire Dragon’s Transmission of the Sword Record* (*Daoist Origins Compendium*) recounts: During the Huichang era, Master Lü, having met with disappointment in his pursuit of official rank, traveled to Jiangzhou and thence to Mount Lu, where he encountered Fire Dragon Perfected, a disciple of Immortal Master Ge. His surname was Zheng, given name Siyuan, and sobriquet Lesser Zhurong. Renowned as a divine physician, he would inscribe talismans and recite incantations for the ailing, and their afflictions would dissolve at once. His lineage traced back to the ancient Zhurong clan. Perceiving Master Lü’s refined and transcendent bone structure, his heart already wandering beyond the mundane world, the Perfected transmitted to him the oral instructions for inner alchemy and self-cultivation. He forged the *Tongtian Divine Sword* (the *Tiandun Sword Method*) and composed a poem:\n\n*\"A thousand leagues to slay demons, lightning coils,\nA white dragon soars through empty skies.\nOnce wielded to sever evil spirits,\nNow bestowed to sever your afflictions.\"*\n\nAt parting, he admonished: \"You may dwell upon this mountain to complete the jade refinement. When you hear the sound of bells, you shall receive the oral instructions for the golden refinement.\" Then he departed. According to this account, the assertion in *Immortals' Mirror* that he first encountered Ancestor Zhong and later Fire Dragon is incorrect, aligning instead with *His Biography*.\n\n*Records of Marvels Verified* further states: During the Huichang era, having twice sat for the imperial examinations without success, he wandered to Mount Lu, where Fire Dragon Perfected transmitted the *Tiandun Sword Method*. Later, he encountered Ancestor Zhong, who bestowed upon him the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The sequence is thus clearly ordered.\n\nIn the first year of Dazhong under Emperor Xuanzong, *dingmao* (847), at fifty. The *Inscription at Wangjiang Pavilion in Jiangzhou* records: \"Having thrice sat for the imperial examinations without success, I wandered rivers and lakes.

Ji, a Daoist of Luo Fu, had received the transmission of Tong Jun and cultivated for centuries upon Mount Luofu, his countenance unaged. When Ancestor Lü sought him, Ji had just been summoned to court and was alone in Panheng Mountain. Suddenly, he encountered Ma Xian, who had come to wander. They delighted in each other’s company.

Thereafter, he visited Mount Luofu, where he met Ancestor Lü in person and declared, \"A great immortal elder!\" Xuanyuan Ji, returning to the mountain, passed the stone bridge and saw two figures descending from a stone tower to welcome him.

      "translated_text": "The Master Lü possessed a transcendent aspiration and a heart for delivering the world. Ji, startled, exclaimed, \"Why did I meet him so late?\" They gathered to speak from the heart, and at parting, Lü composed a poem for Xuanyuan before departing.\n\nAt that time, Ancestor Lü had not yet met Ancestor Zhong. The *Immortal Mirror* records that Ma Ziran said, \"This is the foremost disciple of Zhengyang, the Pure Yang Master.\" This is incorrect. There were two Ma Zirans: one lived during the Dazhong era, with *Ziran* as his courtesy name; the other was a disciple of Liu Haichan, with *Ziran* as his given name. The latter’s *Daoist Songs* include verses about meeting Haichan as his disciple. Later generations conflated the two, unaware that Haichan concealed himself during the reign of King Liu Shouguang of Yan, attaining the Dao between the Later Tang periods—over seventy years after Dazhong. How could Haichan’s grandson-disciple have achieved the Dao before Haichan himself met Ancestor Lü?\n\nIn the year *wuyin* (858), at sixty-one years of age, he dwelled leisurely in his mountain home. In the first year of Xiantong of Emperor Yizong (859), the *jimao* year, he was sixty-two. His *Basic Biography* states that in the early Xiantong era, he passed the imperial examinations. The *Record of Daoist Affinities* notes that in the early Xiantong era, Ancestor Lü, obeying his parents’ wishes, traveled to Chang’an to take the examinations. At a wineshop, he sighed deeply, \"When will I pass the exams to comfort my parents’ hearts? When will I attain the Dao to comfort my own?\" Beside him, a Daoist elder heard this and laughed, saying, \"Does the young master harbor world-transcending aspirations?\" Observing the man—wearing a green kerchief, a white robe, long beard, and elegant eyes, carrying a purple staff and a large gourd at his waist—he inscribed a quatrain on the wall:\n\n*Seated or reclining, ever with a jug of wine,*\n*Never letting these eyes know the imperial capital.*\n*Vast as heaven and earth, yet nameless,*\n*A carefree man wandering the human world.*\n\nAncestor Lü was astonished. Gazing at the elder’s extraordinary appearance and the poem’s soaring spirit, he bowed and inquired after his name. The Daoist replied, \"My compound surname is Zhongli, my given name Quan, and my courtesy name Yunfang.\" Lü bowed again and invited him to sit. Yunfang said, \"Recite a quatrain for me to see.\" Lü then wrote after the first poem:\n\n*Born into a Confucian family in prosperous times,*\n*The weight of official cords oppresses, while humble cloth feels light.*\n*Who in this world would vie for fame and profit?*\n*I serve the Jade Emperor and return to the Upper Clarity.*\n\nYunfang read the poem and rejoiced inwardly. They rested together in the wineshop, where Yunfang personally prepared the meal. Lü suddenly grew weary and, resting his head on the table, dozed off. He dreamed of journeying to the capital as a candidate, passing the imperial examinations, and ascending through the ranks—from local offices to the imperial secretariat, the Censorate, the Hanlin Academy, and the Palace Library—holding every esteemed post in turn.

His descendants flourished, and the household brimmed with officials—caps and tablets filling the halls—for nearly forty years. He served as chief minister for a decade, his power and influence scorching all around. Then, suddenly, he was struck with a grave offense, his family’s wealth confiscated. His wives and children scattered, he was exiled to the southern frontier, left utterly alone, destitute and haggard. As he stood in the wind and snow, his horse beneath him, he sighed deeply—only to awaken with a start.

What is there to rejoice in gain or mourn in loss? Moreover, there is the Great Awakening, after which this human world is but one vast dream.\"\n\nLü was deeply moved, realizing that fame and rank were but illusions. He bowed again and said, \"Master, you are no ordinary man.

If you seek transcendence, you must wait several lifetimes more.\"\n\nLü kowtowed, pleading for instruction, vowing to cultivate good karma in this life. Yunfang said, \"You still have several years of worldly ties left to untangle.\" Then, with a light step, he departed.\n\nLü felt as though he had lost something vital.

      "translated_text": "When eight hundred deeds are perfected, I shall then come to deliver you.\" Lü then asked, \"Has the work of metal and mercury undergone any transformations?\" Cloud Chamber replied, \"After three thousand deeds, it will return to its original essence.\" Lü Zu sighed and said, \"To mislead people three thousand years hence—I would rather not.\" Cloud Chamber laughed and said, \"You have already advanced this far—three thousand and eight hundred deeds are all within this path.\"\n\nHe then recounted the history of his renunciation of the world and attainment of the Dao, adding that Master Ku Zhu had once prophesied: *\"Hereafter, should you encounter one with two mouths, that shall be your disciple. When you find such a person, transmit to them my method of merging sun and moon.\"* Now, examining your surname, it truly matches Ku Zhu’s prophecy. You have come to Zhongnan, yet have not entered the wondrous realm. I dwell on Crane Peak—will you follow me there?\n\nLü Zu immediately accompanied him. Beneath the radiance of stars and moon, all was still and desolate. Cloud Chamber took his hand, and after just a few steps, it seemed as though they rode swift horses across mountains and rivers. In an instant, they arrived at a cave. The southern gate was already locked. Cloud Chamber struck it with his iron staff, and the door swung open of its own accord, revealing a vast expanse. Ascending a high peak, they reached the eastern gate of a great cavern, where two tigers crouched in guard. Cloud Chamber rebuked them, and the tigers lay motionless. He led Lü inside to a terrace of gold and jade, where rare birds and wondrous flowers gleamed in radiant splendor, and the climate was ever spring.\n\nThey sat together upon a flat rock and drank three cups of primordial harmony wine. Presently, a maiden in azure robes appeared—her double buns adorned with golden bells, her crimson gown and jade-green sleeves trailing, her cloud-patterned slippers and jade pendants tinkling. Exotic fragrance wafted around her as she held a silken scroll inscribed in golden script, announcing: *\"The immortals have gathered in the Upper Palace of Penglai. They summon you to the Heavenly Pond Assembly to discuss the spiritual travels of the Five Primal Lords.\"*\n\nAs Cloud Chamber prepared to depart, Lü Zu, fearing he might not return, composed a poem to see him off:\n\n*\"Virtue and Dao so lofty—meetings are rare,\nYet now you journey east to the immortal altar.\nAt your staff’s tip, spring’s hue in a gourd of wine,\nAtop your head, clouds gather in a five-colored crown.\nThe sea-turtle’s child drinks unseen by men,\nThe mountain-burning talisman defies even ghosts’ gaze.\nWhen you depart, this body must age—\nI beg you, grant this poor scholar a bone-transforming elixir.\"*\n\nCloud Chamber replied, *\"Simply remain here.\"*",

Within qi, water is born; within water, qi is born—the mechanism of heart and kidney communion. By employing the eight trigrams to move the twelve hours, the crux lies in *Gen*. By the three fields mutually interacting and reverting, the crux lies in the *mud-pill*.

In playful verse, he addressed him:\n\n*\"A fine old tree-spirit south of the city,\nClearly aware a transcendent was passing by.\"*\n—alluding to his longevity and discernment.\n\nThe Immortal Liu later recorded: \"Some claim I attained the Dao as a willow spirit—how grievously mistaken! As the scriptures say: *The human form is hard to obtain; birth in the Middle Kingdom is rare; a true master is difficult to encounter.* Moreover, Ancestor Lü taught: *After ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths, one gains a human body—know that this is the fruit of past causes.* How could a mere creature achieve the Dao? My surname is Guo. I simply took pleasure in planting willows and styled myself *Liu Qing*. Through long life and enduring vision, people came to call me *Liu Xian*—that is all.\"\n\nThe *Immortal’s Mirror* states: \"Ancestor Lü walked in the southern outskirts when he saw a man seated beneath a willow tree. Upon inquiry, he learned this was the young servant Jier, who, after his master’s household declined, had hanged himself from the willow. His lingering spirit, bright and unyielding, often manifested. Ancestor Lü compassionately instructed him, bestowing the completed elixir for ingestion. He transformed his demonic appearance and set him to tending the furnace and cooking, calling him *Guo Shangzao*—'Guo the Hearth-Keeper.' This account is erroneous.\" *(See the later* Transmission of the Immortal Guo*.)*\n\n**Delivering Zhang Ci** *(Recorded in the* Daoist Origins Compendium*)*\nCi, a failed candidate in the imperial examinations during the early Xiantong era, wandered the Jiang-Huai region for years. Meeting Ancestor Lü, he received instruction in the Daoist arts. He often cultivated qi and abstained from grains, fond of wine and chess, carefree and unconstrained.

      "translated_text": "Upon sobering, he composed two poems—one extolling virtue, the other pleading his case—and presented them. The poem extolling virtue reads:\n\n*\"Our household’s fragrance ever lingers, orchid and valerian sweet,\nA clan of ancient renown, its name tied to a state’s might.\nMy bearing still as autumn’s moonlit shadow cast,\nMy prose and verse resounding like the ocean’s roaring tide.\nThe courtroom rests in peace, its zither tuned with care,\nWhy not, in the prefect’s hall, drink deep from jade cups bright?\nToday, beneath East Point Bridge, the waters flow—\nA single current, henceforth, shall remain serene and clear.\"*\n\nThe magistrate, upon reading the poem, recognized him as a man of refined virtue and moral cultivation. He then sought the essential teachings from him. Ci replied that the magistrate, as governor of a vast district, had no leisure to pursue the mysteries of the Dao. Instead, he inscribed a poem by Ancestor Lü to open his mind:\n\n*\"Why seek the Way through outward means, as if by ladder’s climb?\nLong life is found within—there cultivate your time.\nSay not the Great Dao’s hard to grasp,\nFor it is your resolve that falls behind at last.\"*\n\nThe magistrate bowed in admiration. Another day, as he prepared to take leave of the magistrate, Ci spontaneously recited:\n\n*\"Zhang Ci, Zhang Ci—he understands not,\nThough all the world’s classics fill his breast.\nHis body drifts, drifting through the mortal plane,\nYet his heart soars far beyond the heavens’ crest.\"*\n\nLater, he ascended to immortality in the lands south of the Yangtze. There, he wandered among the famous mountains. When he encountered those who set up furnaces for alchemical arts, he laughed heartily and commanded a brush to inscribe upon their walls:\n\n*\"What use is black gold sand,\nThat will not stay aloft in flight?\nThe red furnace burns the elixir in vain,\nCan it preserve the bloom of youth’s bright light?\nToday the blossoms bloom upon the bough,\nTomorrow they shall fall from branch and tree.\nBetter to drink your wine and let it be—\nWhy fret the passing years’ unyielding flow?\"*\n\nThe *Annals of Years* had earlier foretold this in a poem addressed to Scholar Zhang Ci. After returning home, the Master journeyed to the Jiang-Huai region. He tested his sacred sword, slaying a long *jiao*. Arriving at Dongting Lake, he ascended Yueyang Tower and drank alone.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Yizong established ordination platforms, conferring precepts upon monks and nuns, and the common folk universally revered Buddhism—such was an era when the Dao was slighted and the Buddha exalted. At this juncture, Master Lü guided Huaiyi into the Daoist path, a moment akin to setting a pole in rushing waters.\n\nFrom the *renchen* year of Emperor Xizong’s reign (872) through the *bingwu* year of the *Ganfu* era’s first year (874), followed by *dingyou* (877, when Wang Xianzhi seized Huainan), *wuxu* (878, when Huang Chao captured Yizhou and Handan), *jihai* (879), *gengzi* (880, when the era name was changed to *Guangming* and Huang Chao took Luoyang, entered Chang’an, and proclaimed himself Emperor of Da Qi)—over these nine years, Master Lü girded his sword and wielded his whisk, traversing famous mountains. Among his works were poems such as *Encountering Xuanyuan Ji on the Descent from Mount Lu*, *Presented to Swordsmen and Chivalrous Men*, *Presented to the Masters of the Upper and Lower Stone Chambers of Mount Song*, *Encountering Ma Xiang at Mount Hua*, and *For Du Han of Mount Shang and Qingfu*.\n\nHe ordained Han Hanbai (not Han Xiang) as a terrestrial immortal. Hanbai, styled Qingfu, was a great-great-nephew of Han Yu. Born on the third day of the ninth month in the final year of the *Zhenyuan* era (805), he displayed extraordinary traits from childhood. He never entered the imperial examinations but instead encountered Master Xiaohongya, who transmitted to him the methods of pure cultivation. Preserving his youthful vitality without leakage, he was styled Yuanyangzi. His movements were unpredictable, his conduct untrammeled.\n\nDuring the *Changqing* era (821–824), Han Xiang passed the imperial examinations, and Han Yu urged Hanbai to study books, saying, \"Take the examinations as your elder brother did.\" Hanbai replied, \"My nephew’s aspirations differ from yours,\" and composed the poem *Green Mountains, Clouds, and Water—This Place Is My Home* to express his resolve. Han Yu, recognizing his determination could not be forced, ceased pressing him.\n\nWhen Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou, Han Xiang accompanied him. One day, they reached the Blue Pass, where the wind was biting, the snow heavy. Suddenly, the sound of a flute approached, playing before the horse’s head. It was Hanbai. Overjoyed, Han Yu took him to their lodging and still hoped to inspire him with worldly success. Hanbai merely smiled without answering. At parting, he presented a pill of medicine, saying, \"Take this to ward off miasmic poison,\" then drifted away like the wind. This occurred at the end of the *Xiantong* era.",

You have now wandered Penglai; you shall first attain immortality before returning to the Buddhist path.\" With that, they departed. From then on, Huaiyi no longer consumed grains. One day, he returned to Yue and recounted the tale to his parents, expressing his wish to wander afar and visit famous sites. They granted their permission.",

      "translated_text": "He retreated to the mountains of Shang to refine the Nine-Florescence Divine Elixir, yet remained uncertain of the subtleties of fire and timing. When Patriarch Lü came to wander there, he entrusted him with the secret methods of Ancestor Zhong.\n\n*An Examination of Whether Han Xiang Was an Immortal*\nHan Xiang, styled Beizhu, was the great-nephew of Han Yu. Han Yu’s elder brother was Han Yan; Han Yan’s son was Han Laocheng; Han Laocheng’s son was Han Xiang. He passed the imperial examination in the third year of the *Changqing* era, was skilled in poetry and prose, and exchanged verses with the scholar-officials of his time. Throughout his life, amid the pursuit of worldly success, he never studied the Dao. During the *Changqing* era, Yao of Wugong wrote *In Reply to Han Xiang*, which reads:\n\n*Yesterday I heard you passed the spring examinations,*\n*Your name now recorded in the Ministry’s register.*\n*At thirty, you’ve scaled the highest ranks—*\n*The road ahead stretches vast and hard to fathom.*\n\nHe also wrote *Seeing Han Xiang Off to Serve in Jiangxi*:\n\n*A young man who passed the imperial exams,*\n*Now summoned to military service by imperial decree.*\n*His traveling gear includes weapons,*\n*While poets fill the farewell banquet.*\n\nHan Xiang once saw Han Yu off as he departed for Chaozhou. In the *Collected Works of Han Changli*, there are two poems titled *At the Zeng River Mouth, Presented to My Great-Nephew Xiang*, and one titled *Left Behind at the Blue Pass, Presented to My Great-Nephew Xiang*. Even Jia Dao wrote *A Poem Sent to Han Xiang*. All these are found in the *Complete Tang Poems*. None mention his unrestrained, wandering ways or his youthful affinity for rivers and clouds. This clearly shows he was no immortal.\n\nYet does this mean there was no Han the Immortal at all? Not so. The *Record of Daoist Affinities* states: Han Changli had a great-nephew named Han Bai, born on the third day of the ninth month in the final years of *Zhenyuan*. From childhood, he was extraordinary. He never entered the examination halls but encountered Zhang Yun of Lesser Hongya, who transmitted to him the practice of pure cultivation. Preserving his youthful essence without leakage, he was called Master Yuanyang. He then roamed freely, embodying the original teachings of the Dao. In the early *Changqing* era, when Han [Xiang] passed the imperial exams, Han Yu urged Han Bai to study books and take the examinations, as his elder brother Rong had done. Han Bai replied, \"My aspirations differ from yours,\" and composed a poem expressing his resolve:\n\n*A cave in green mountains, clouds, and water—*\n*This place is my home.*\n*At night, I feast on jade nectar;*\n*At dawn, I chew descending rosy clouds.*\n*I play the zither in jade-green tunes,*\n*Refine cinnabar in the furnace.*\n*The precious tripod holds the golden tiger;*\n*The mushroom fields nurture white crows.*\n*A single gourd contains the world;*\n*A three-foot blade slays demons.*\n*I can brew wine in an instant,*\n*And make flowers bloom in a moment.*\n*If anyone can learn from me,*\n*Come with me to see the immortal blossoms.*\n\nHan Yu, recognizing his determination could not be forced, ceased pressing him. Han Bai claimed he could conjure extraordinary flowers. Han Yu bade him demonstrate. Han Bai took a basin, filled it with soil, and with a wave of his hand, produced a cluster of peonies, radiant and uncommon. On the petals was inscribed a couplet in golden characters:\n\n*Clouds stretch across Qin Ridge—where is home?*\n*Snow blocks the Blue Pass—my horse cannot advance.*\n\nHan Yu asked what this meant. Han Bai replied, \"You will know in nine days.\"",

      "translated_text": "Later, when Han Yu was demoted to Chaozhou, he passed through Blue Pass, where a heavy snowstorm blocked his way. Just then, Han Bai arrived and cleared the snow for him. Only then did Han Yu realize the meaning of the poem on the peony petals. He composed eight lines to complete it, and his traveler’s melancholy eased somewhat. He still wished to share lodgings with Han Bai, hoping to inspire him toward worldly achievement, and wrote a poem:\n\n*\"Since ancient times, many talents have served the world—*\n*Who could surpass your mighty prose, like yours?*\n*Wait until the day your merit and fame are complete,*\n*Then withdraw to recline amid mist and vines.\"*\n\nHan Bai smiled and replied:\n\n*\"The whole world is drunk on fame and profit—*\n*Only I am awake upon the Dao.*\n*One day, I shall surely ascend in flight,*\n*Piercing the autumn sky as a speck of blue.\"*\n\nBefore parting, Han Bai gave Han Yu a pill, saying, *\"Take this to ward off miasmic poison.\"* Then he drifted away like a wisp of mist. In the late Xiantong era, Han Bai was over sixty when he again met Master Lü on Mount Shang. Receiving the teachings of divine elixirs, he ascended as an immortal. Today, people know of Han Xiang but not of Han Bai (氵柏), for the two names have been confused through scribal errors—mistaking *Xiang* (湘) for *Bai* (柏). To call Han Xiang an immortal is to wrong him, for all of Han Bai’s deeds have been attributed to Han Xiang, while Han Xiang’s own deeds have been erased. Here, I present both their stories together to clarify: Han Xiang pursued worldly merit, while Han Bai was a divine immortal. *Bai* (柏) suggests the clarity of shallow waters, hence his sobriquet, *Qingfu* (Clear Man).\n\n---\n\n**Immortal He, the Celestial Maiden**\n\nThe Celestial Maiden, surnamed He, was a native of Lingling in Yongzhou. Her father was named Ying, and her mother, née Zhong, favored quietude and almsgiving. One evening, her mother dreamed of strolling along the Xiao and Xiang rivers, where she saw a woman in white silk robes standing atop a great white lotus, gliding over the waves. The woman said, *\"I am the Spirit of the Xiao and Xiang. I shall lodge in your home to briefly wander the mortal realm.\"* Her mother gazed at her for a long time before awakening, already with child. On the first day of the eleventh month in the third year of the Yuanhe era, the child was born. She refused her mother’s milk and was fed lotus-root powder instead. By eight or nine, she was graceful and lovely, fond of visiting Daoist convents, where the nuns taught her scriptures and calligraphy—subjects she mastered as if by second nature.\n\nAt thirteen, she lost both parents and lived in seclusion with her aunt and an old servant. She ate only vegetarian fare and, as her parents had done, gladly gave alms to those in need. Later, at the Nanyue Abbey, an elderly nun sought her help to restore the statue of the Life-Endowing Perfected Lord. When they opened its chest, they found two scrolls of the *Yellow Court Scripture* inside, with a colophon reading: *\"Whoever is destined, whoever is blessed—if they obtain this scripture, they shall know the joy of the Jasper Pool.\"* Delighted, the maiden saw the two *He* (何) characters and, though the words were ambiguous, took them as clearly referring to herself. She asked to exchange other scriptures for these, and the old nun readily agreed. From then on, she recited the *Yellow Court* at home.\n\nAt eighteen, she remained chaste and unmarried, taking vows as a Daoist nun in her own home. She swept the floors, burned incense, and paid homage to the Lord of Fusang. After some time, the Azure Lad, sent by the Eastern Flowery Lord, descended to her home. He bestowed upon her pills of purple mushrooms and taught her the methods of the *Yellow Court*, the *Threefold Lute-Heart*, and the *Gargling of Numinous Fluid*. She accepted these teachings, and thereafter her body radiated light, her qi carried the fragrance of orchids, and she repelled all evil while refining her countenance like jade.\n\nWhen suitors from Lingling sought her hand, she feigned madness, wandering the markets in filth and disarray. People dismissed her as a lunatic and paid her no mind. Some even mockingly called her a \"Celestial Maiden,\" which only made her conceal her abilities further. At sixty, many in her village had passed away, yet she retained the appearance of a woman in her twenties. Just then, Master Lü, traveling south through Heng and Xiang, encountered her in the market and recognized her as a vessel of the highest Dao. He gave her a peach, of which she ate only half. From that day, she never hungered again and could foretell fortune and misfortune.\n\nShe entered Zhongnan Mountain to pay homage to Ancestor Zhong, who taught her the arts of divine elixirs and dietary practices. Soon, she could walk on air, ascending and descending without hindrance. Master Lü said, *\"Your practice has now reached the Great Vehicle.\"* He led her east to meet Ancestor Shaoyang, who in turn introduced her to the Wood Lord and the Metal Mother. The Metal Mother took her back to the Penglai Gardens, where she swept fallen peach blossoms, accumulating merit until she ascended to the Azure Mist Grotto of the Eastern Sea as the True Great Primordial Lord, with the Daoist name *Yiyang*. She often accompanied Master Lü in his travels through the world, leaving behind many miraculous traces.\n\n---\n\n**Note on Immortal He the Celestial Maiden:**\nThere were two Celestial Maidens surnamed He. One was from Zengcheng in Guangzhou, the second daughter of He Tai. As a child, she followed companions into the mountains to pick tea but lost her way. At the foot of the eastern peak, she saw a Daoist in a tall hat and bowed to him. The Daoist gave her a peach, and after eating it, she no longer felt hunger or thirst. Later, she dreamed of the immortal Ma Gu, who taught her to eat mica powder. Over time, she could traverse mountains and valleys with a light body, flying as she went. During the Changshou era of Empress Wu Zetian, she was summoned to court but vanished mid-journey, leaping into the treetops. Later, she appeared repeatedly at the Ma Gu Altar in Yuzhang. The *Biographies of Female Immortals* refers to the \"Three Immortal Maidens Who Bestow Children\"—namely, the Guangzhou He Maiden, the Ethereal Maiden, and Ma Gu.\n\n---\n\n**Earth Immortal Li Qi** *(from the* Late Tang Biographies of Eminent Scholars*)*\n\nLi Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, was an old man who had obtained the Lesser Return Elixir. Though centuries old, his appearance never aged. When Master Lü traveled to Gou Rong to visit the scenic wonders of the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven, he encountered the old man among the pines and misty waters. Recognizing him as a man of lofty virtue, Master Lü taught him the art of refining the Golden Fluid Great Return. Overjoyed, the old man asked to become his disciple. Master Lü replied, *\"I am younger than you, sir. Let us be friends of the clouds and mist instead.\"* The old man said, *\"In the Dao, there is no before or after—only the higher may be the teacher.\"* He bowed deeply, and Master Lü reached into his bag to secretly transmit the teachings, then presented him with a poem:\n\n*\"In the mountains of Huayang, many are the mushroom fields;*\n*The old man of Huayang lives on, year after year.*\n*By the green pines, he climbs the tallest trees;*\n*Amid the white clouds, he drinks from flying springs.*\n*Neither hot nor cold, his spirit drifts freely;*\n*East and west he wanders, his qi flowing endlessly.*\n*When his three thousand merits are complete, he shall return—*\n*But tell no one of the grotto-heaven.\"*",

He left behind two more poems as gifts and departed with a graceful flourish.\n\n**The Dream of Lu Sheng in Handan**\n\nDuring the *Ganfu* era, Master Lü journeyed north. He styled himself \"Master Lü\" and traveled along the road to Handan. (One version dates this to the nineteenth year of *Kaiyuan*; another to the seventh year of *Kaicheng*. The *Kaiyuan* period predates Master Lü’s birth, and *Kaicheng* lasted only five years—both are incorrect.) He rested at an inn, removing his hat and loosening his bag as he sat.\n\nSoon, a young man in coarse hempen clothes rode up on a black colt, bound for the fields, and also stopped at the inn. He shared a seat with the Master, and their conversation flowed freely. When asked his name, the youth replied, \"Lu Ying, styled Cuizhi.\"\n\nGazing at his shabby attire, Lu sighed deeply: \"A true man born into this world yet so ill-fated—how can I not call this suffering?\" The Master said, \"Your body shows no sign of hardship or illness, and your words are lighthearted. Why then do you sigh over such distress?\"\n\nLu replied, \"This is merely my lot in life—what joy is there to speak of?\"\n\nThe Master asked, \"If this is not joy, then what would be?\"\n\nLu answered, \"A scholar’s life should be one of great achievement and renown—leading armies as a general, governing as a minister, feasting from bronze tripods, enjoying the finest music, enriching his clan and prospering his household. Only then could one call it joy. I once aspired to learning, mastered the arts, and believed high office was within reach. Yet now, past my prime, I still toil in the fields—what else is this if not suffering?\"\n\nAs he spoke, his eyes grew heavy with drowsiness. The innkeeper was steaming millet at the time. The Master reached into his bag and produced a celadon pillow, offering it to Lu: \"Rest your head upon this, and it shall bring you glory, just as you desire.\"\n\nLu lowered his gaze to the pillow’s opening. Its two ends had small apertures that gradually widened, growing bright and clear. He entered with his whole body.\n\nAfter several months at home, he married the daughter of the Cui clan of Qinghe. Her beauty was radiant, and her dowry abundant. From then on, his attire and possessions grew ever more splendid. The following year, he passed the imperial examinations, donned official robes, and was appointed *Xiaoshu Lang* and later *Weinan* magistrate by imperial decree. Soon after, he was promoted to *Jiancha Yushi*, then *Qiju Sheren*, and served as *Zhizhigao* for three years. He was then appointed governor of Tongzhou and later transferred to Shanzhou.\n\nLu was ambitious in governance. In Shaanxi, he excavated eighty *li* of the Yellow River to restore blocked waterways, benefiting the people, who carved a stele in his honor. Later, he was transferred to Bianzhou, serving as *Hedong Caifangshi*, and was summoned to the capital as *Jingzhao Yin*.\n\nAt that time, the Divine Martial Emperor was engaged in campaigns against the northern tribes, expanding the empire’s borders. When the Tubo chieftains Xina Luo and Zhulong Mangbutu seized Guazhou and Shazhou, and the regional commander Wang Junchan was newly defeated and killed, the Hexi region trembled in fear. The Emperor sought a capable general and appointed Lu as *Yushi Zhongcheng* and *Hexi Jiedushi*. Lu crushed the enemy, beheading seven thousand, reclaiming nine hundred *li* of land, and constructing a great fortress to secure the strategic pass. The border people erected a stele on Juyan Mountain in his praise.\n\nUpon his return to the capital, he was lavished with honors and rewards. He was promoted to *Shibu Shilang*, then *Hubu Shangshu*, concurrently serving as *Yushi Daifu*. His reputation was impeccable, and the people held him in high esteem. However, this drew the envy of the prime minister, who falsely accused him. He was demoted to *Ruizhou Cishi* and, after three years, recalled as *Changshi*. Before long, he was appointed *Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi*, serving alongside Prime Minister Xiao Song and Pei Guangting, jointly governing for over a decade. His counsel was wise and discreet, and he was summoned thrice daily to offer advice, earning the title of \"virtuous minister.\" Yet his peers resented him and falsely accused him of conspiring with border generals in treasonous plots. An imperial decree ordered his arrest, and officers arrived at his door to seize him.\n\nIn panic, Lu turned to his wife and children: \"My family has five *qing* of fertile land in Shandong—enough to ward off hunger and cold. Why did I ever seek office, only to meet this fate? From now on, I shall never again wear coarse hempen clothes, ride a black colt, or travel the road to Handan.\" He drew his blade to take his own life, but his wife intervened and saved him.\n\nLater, through the protection of palace officials, his death sentence was commuted, and he was exiled to Huanzhou for several years. The Emperor, learning of his innocence, restored him as *Zhongshu Ling* and enfeoffed him as Duke of Yan, bestowing extraordinary favor.\n\nLu had five sons: Jian, Zun, Wei, Ti, and Yi, all men of talent. Jian passed the imperial examinations and became *Kaogong Yuanwailang*; Zun served as *Yushi*; Wei as *Taichang Cheng*; and Ti as *Wannian* magistrate.",

      "translated_text": "Yi was the most virtuous of them all. At twenty-four, he became *Zuogong*, and his in-laws were all eminent families of the realm. He had over ten grandsons. Twice exiled to the remote frontiers, twice elevated to the highest offices, he served both at court and in the provinces, soaring through the halls of power for over fifty years. His glory and splendor were resplendent. By nature, he was rather extravagant and indulgent, fond of pleasure. His rear palace and entertainments were all of the finest elegance; the imperial gifts of fertile lands, grand mansions, beauties, and fine steeds he received were beyond count.\n\nIn later years, as he gradually declined with age, he repeatedly petitioned to retire, but the Emperor refused. During his illness, well-wishers thronged the roads to inquire after him, and renowned physicians and rare medicines were sent without fail. On the verge of death, he submitted a memorial:\n\n*\"Your servant was originally a scholar from the mountains of Shandong, content to find joy in his fields and gardens. By chance, I encountered this sagely reign and was granted an official post, receiving far more favor than I deserved. I was singled out for profound grace, sent forth to bear the banner of command, and brought back to ascend the highest offices. Moving between court and provinces, I have passed through the years, unworthy of Heaven’s kindness, yet contributing nothing to Your Majesty’s transformative influence. I have ridden in a carriage meant for the worthy while wearing the cap of a fool, treading thin ice with ever-growing dread, fearing each day more than the last, unaware that old age had crept upon me. Now past eighty, my rank has reached the highest of the Three Excellencies. The clepsydra’s flow has ceased, my sinews and veins have withered, and as I linger in this feeble state, my allotted time nears its end. Looking back, I have achieved nothing to repay Your Majesty’s radiant virtue. I have squandered profound grace, and now, as I take my leave of this sagely age, my gratitude and longing are beyond expression. Humbly, I submit this memorial in gratitude.\"*\n\nThe imperial edict replied:\n\n*\"You, with your outstanding virtue, have been Our foremost minister. Abroad, you upheld the realm’s defenses; at court, you aided in fostering harmony and prosperity. For two decades of peace, it was you who bore the weight of governance. Recently, afflicted by illness, We daily hoped for your recovery, never expecting this grave malady, which fills Us with deep sorrow. Now, We dispatch the General of the Brave Cavalry, Gao Lishi, to visit and inquire after you at your residence.

The innkeeper’s millet was not yet steamed, and all else remained as before. Startled, he rose and exclaimed, “Could this have been but a dream?”\n\nThe Master replied, “Such is the nature of human life’s passage.”\n\nLu Sheng, lost in thought for a long while, bowed deeply and said, “Now I comprehend the Dao of honor and disgrace, the principle of rise and fall, the sentiment of gain and loss, and the threshold of life and death. This is how you, Master, have curbed my desires. I humbly accept your teaching.”\n\nHe kowtowed twice, then entreated initiation. The Master, moved, consented and took him as a disciple. He transmitted the secret of the Great Elixir and taught him swordsmanship, whereupon Lu Sheng followed Master Lü in roaming the seas.\n\nAt times, when great turmoil arose, he returned west to the Hedong region, relocating his family to Mount Zhongnan. There, he encountered the *Poems on Retreat* by Minister Biaosheng. Hao Tianting’s commentary on Ancestor Lü states: “Having passed the imperial examinations in the Xiantong era, he served twice as a county magistrate. During the Huang Chao rebellion, he moved his family to Mount Zhongnan.” The *Grass Hall Records* recount: “During the Ganfu era, when Huang Chao rebelled, I fled with Immortal Liu to Hedong. My wife, née Liu, had become a Daoist nun at home, while my four sons made their livelihoods elsewhere. Thus, I brought her to Mount Zhongnan and entrusted her to Purple Cloud Hermitage, where Mother He instructed her. After my liberation through *shijie*, I summoned them to the Jing Mountain Grotto.” Another inscription on a small ink portrait of himself reads: “To escape the chaos, I took only my wife into the mountains with me.”\n\nFrom these two accounts, it is clear he had both wife and children, and the events were real—though the ink inscription does not mention returning home to fetch them after attaining the Dao. As for claims that his surname was Li and given name Jue, that he and his wife cultivated the Dao together, and that he later changed his surname to Lü—these are all allegorical. (See the sixth year of the Tianqi era for details.)\n\nHe initiated Niu Sheng and Xiahou Sheng.",

Even after the Liang’s three generations, they continued to use the *Tianyou* era—this was the doing of Hedong and Fengxiang.\n\nLi Keyong, originally granted the Tang surname, abandoned the *Zhuye* clan to return to the Central Plains. Through toil and hardship, he pacified Huang Chao and was enfeoffed as Prince of Jin. He vowed never to betray his principles in his lifetime—how loyal he was! His successor, Li Cunxu, faithfully upheld his father’s legacy and was filial by nature. Though he failed to seek out the Tang imperial clan after destroying Liang, he rightfully inherited the state treasures and was recognized as the legitimate successor of Later Tang. This is no falsehood.",
      "overlap_context": "y wife into the mountains with me.”\n\nFrom these two accounts, it is clear he had both wife and children, and the events were real—though the ink inscription does not mention returning home to fetch them after attaining the Dao. As for claims that his surname was Li and given name Jue, that he and his wife cultivated the Dao together, and that he later changed his surname to Lü—these are all allegorical. (See the sixth year of the Tianqi era for details.)\n\nHe initiated Niu Sheng and Xiahou Sheng.",

The August Ancestor of Song, heeding Heaven’s mandate and sweeping away the myriad traitors—yet Southern Tang was the last to fall, and the Song’s succession from Southern Tang is plain to see. Let this be left to those who read history.\n\n**Du Raotingzhi**\nRaotingzhi, styled Liangong, was a native of Nancheng. In the early Zhonghe era of Emperor Xizong, he passed the imperial examinations and once visited Yellow Crane Tower in Wuchang, where he heard the sound of a flute and sought its source. There he met the Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to him the secret formulas of stillness practice. From then on, he kept his distance from wives and concubines, dwelling in serene seclusion. Later, he served as Vice Prefect of Dengzhou and died; when his coffin was returned to his hometown, it was remarkably light, for he had departed through *shijie*. The *Daoist Affinities Compendium*, *Records of the Strange*, and *Genealogical Registers* all list him as a Tang dynasty *jinshi*, yet the *Complete Book* alone records him as a man of the late Song. This is because the *Immortals’ Mirror* places his account in the Jingding era, unaware that what it records is his manifestation in the late Song, when he appeared in divine form and roamed Mount Nanyue with the Patriarch Lü—a supplementary account of his origins.\n\n**Du and Horse Immortal Maiden** (*Daoist Affinities Compendium*)\nDuring the Guanghua era, the Patriarch Lü traveled to Kuocang and passed through Chuzhou, where he initiated Horse Immortal Maiden. The Maiden, a native of Qingtian, had married into poverty yet served her mother-in-law with utmost filial piety. Meeting Master Lü, she received the arts of immortality. She would go to the homes of wealthy families to spin and weave for hire. Though her work took her a hundred *li* from home, she would not eat the soup offered there; instead, she sent her bamboo hat floating back ahead of her to present it to her mother-in-law. Recognizing the hat as her daughter-in-law’s, the mother-in-law would then eat. Her comings and goings were so effortless that people began to sense her extraordinary nature, calling her Horse Great Immortal Maiden. When King Qian Liu of Wuyue heard of her, he provided money and silk to support her mother-in-law. Soon after, the mother-in-law passed away, and the Immortal Maiden, too, departed without illness. Neighbors saw her in the wilds, saying, “I follow my master to Penglai.”\n\n**Together with Zhongli Quan, Du Initiated Lan Caihe** (from his own account: Caihe, styled Yangsu, was a fellow Daoist of mine. In his youth, he met Master Zhengyang, who transmitted to him the arts of refining jade and refining gold. In the early Tianfu era, his Great Elixir was completed. I urged him to refine the Divine Elixir further, that he might transcend the spirit and enter transformation, thereby delivering sentient beings. Later, his Divine Elixir was perfected, and he ascended at Haoliang.)\nLan Caihe was an ancient immortal of the highest rank, a musician of the era of Fuxi, who had been banished to the dusty world. Wandering and singing, he awakened the blind and deaf. He often wore a tattered indigo robe, a black water-buffalo leather belt three *cun* wide, one foot shod and the other bare. In summer, he stuffed his robe with padding; in winter, he slept in snow, his breath steaming as if from a furnace. When asked what he had attained, he replied, “Who says men cannot conceive? I alone have carried a child for ten months.” In the cities, he would beg, holding a large clapper over three *chi* long, with young and old following to watch. He sang:\n*Tread, tread the song,\nLan Caihe—\nHow long can the world endure?\nThe rosy face is a springtime tree,\nThe flowing light a shuttle cast.\nThe ancients, once gone, never return;\nThe present crowd ever more in number.\nAt dawn, riding simurgh and phoenix through the azure void,\nAt dusk, seeing mulberry fields rise as white waves.\nThe radiance of long light hangs in empty space,\nGolden and silver palaces towering, lofty and grand.*\nHis songs were many, but they cannot all be recorded here.

After living in the dust of the world for several years, he declared he would enter Mount Zhongnan to gather and eat divine mushrooms. (This was at the urging of Patriarch Lü.) During the Later Liang dynasty, he suddenly appeared at a wine pavilion in Haoliang, where he drank to great intoxication. Hearing the sounds of reed pipes and flutes in the sky, he saw cranes descend, and mounting one, he soared into the clouds, casting down his boots, robe, belt, and clapper as he rose slowly away.

Passing the imperial examinations with distinction, he served as Controller of Lulong in Yan, rising through the ranks to become chief minister. He had long been devoted to discussions of nature and destiny, revering the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. One day, he encountered Master Zhengyang, who expounded to him the school of purity and non-action, revealing the principles of preserving the Dao and perfecting the elixir.\n\nWhen [Liu] Shouguang usurped the imperial title, Haichan remonstrated in vain, then feigned illness, relinquished his seal, and departed. He wrote a poem:\n*Three thousand souls cast from the burning house,*\n*A million households’ armed gates left behind.*\n\nHe changed his name to Xuanying and took the sobriquet Master Haichan. Traveling widely in search of the Dao, he met Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to him the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir. He then withdrew to cultivate the truth, attained the immortal way, and wandered the mortal world. Far afloat on the Qin River, he refined the real in the valleys of Mount Taihua and concealed his traces beneath Qingcheng. When Chen Tuan met him, he earnestly sought the profound teachings, and Haichan transmitted to him the wondrous Dao of the Golden Elixir. Tuan, along with his disciples Zhang Wumeng, Jia Desheng, and Chong Fang, all received instruction from him.\n\nHaichan admired Tuan’s lofty aspirations and once visited his mountain retreat, where they discoursed for a day. In jest, he splashed ink on a rock, and it formed into lines of verse. Later, when Zhang, Jia, and Chong arrived at the mountain, each recounted that on a certain day, Master Liu had visited their homes and splashed ink to form characters—evidently, he had manifested in multiple forms on the same day.

      "translated_text": "There was a woman of the Geng clan, a native of the Southern Tang. Her nature was lofty and pure, her mind subtle and wondrous. Patriarch Lü, upon seeing her, recognized her and said, \"Master He, this one may become your disciple.\" Yiyang replied, \"The Great Dao is impartial—she must first be tested.\"\n\nAt that time, the Geng maiden had gone to the outskirts, carrying a vegetable basket and walking alone. Yiyang stepped forward in jest and said, \"Young lady, do you have any broth? Might you share some with this Daoist woman to quench her thirst?\" She replied, \"I do, but my home is rather far away.\" Yiyang said, \"Hand me the basket, and I will send someone to fetch it from your home.\" The Geng maiden asked, \"Who will take it?\" Yiyang answered, \"The basket will go on its own.\"\n\nThe maiden did not believe her. Yiyang silently exerted her spiritual power, and at once the basket floated away. In an instant, it returned, filled with the maiden’s clothing and skirt. The Geng maiden was astonished and said, \"Are you a Daoist sorceress or a transcendent immortal?\" Yiyang smiled and said, \"If this is considered sorcery, sorcery can be learned; if this is considered immortality, immortality can be pursued.\" The maiden, suddenly enlightened, wished to follow and study the arts of immortality.\n\nYiyang revealed her true form to her, and the maiden rejoiced greatly. Together, they paid homage to Patriarch Lü, who transmitted to her the wondrous methods of dual cultivation. The Geng maiden then abandoned her home and wandered the clouds. She could mold snow into silver and paint cloth into embroidery. When Master Zhu Xi saw her, he marveled at her and inquired about the Daoist arts. The maiden responded with wild, incoherent speech, and Zhu could not press her further.\n\nThereafter, her marvels multiplied, and people called her Wind Immortal Maiden. Sun Bu’er, the wife of the Seven Perfected’s Ma Yifu, had early followed Wang Chongyang in the study of the Dao. Later, she encountered the Immortal Maiden and brought her to Luoyang, where she established the Wind Immortal Grotto for her to reside. After Sun Bu’er attained the Dao, the Immortal Maiden also drifted away, never to return. She was enfeoffed as Pure Numinous and Wondrously Awakened Geng Immortal Maiden.\n\n**The Conversion of Huang Chengxu**\nChengxu, a native of the Southern Tang, cultivated stillness in the depths of Mount Tongbai. His heart was drawn to the Dao, yet his practice was not diligent. Patriarch Lü visited him and left a poem to admonish him, appending a six-line postscript:\n\n*\"I leave these few words to express my intent.\nWhen next we meet, I shall surely decide for you.\nDo not retreat from your original resolve—\ncherish it well, cherish it well.\"*\n\nAt the time, Huang was away elsewhere. Upon his return, he saw the immortal’s brushstrokes left upon his hermitage gate and was suddenly awakened. Another day, Patriarch Lü returned and took him away.\n\n**The Cowherd’s Poem for Zhong Fu**\nZhong Fu, styled Ruoweng, was the military governor of Pingliang. Patriarch Lü, wearing a headscarf and a robe of white ramie, came to pay his respects. A cowherd leading a yellow calf followed him. Standing in the courtyard, Ruoweng was struck by the patriarch’s serene and refined bearing. Pointing to the cowherd, he said, \"Daoist, can you compose a poem on this?\" The Daoist smiled and said, \"No need for my words—this boy can do it himself.\"\n\nThe cowherd then took up the brush and wrote in large characters:\n*\"Grass spreads across the wilds for six or seven li,\nA flute plays three or four notes in the evening breeze.\nReturning, he eats his fill at dusk,\nAnd sleeps beneath the moon, still clad in his straw cloak.\"*\n\nAfter they departed, all saw him carrying two jars, singing loudly as he left the city. Someone reported to Ruoweng, \"Those were two jars—those were Lü’s jars!\" He hurried to pursue them, but they had vanished without a trace.\n\n**Lament for the Southern Tang**\nAt the end of the Baoda era of the Southern Tang, Patriarch Lü transformed into a fisherman in Jiangnan, calling himself the Returning Guest. Each day, he carried a palm-leaf hat and fishing rod, singing the *Fisherman’s Pride*, using his tongue to mimic the sound of a striking oar as accompaniment. His voice was clear and mournful, as if lingering amid mist and waves. He wandered around Jinling for over a year, yet none awakened to his presence.\n\nHis lyrics went:\n*\"In Jiangnan’s second month, the mountain paths by rivers,\nPlum blossoms scatter, spring has no master.\nA single fish has nowhere to seek—\nWind and rain,\nThe jade dragon grows scales and returns to heaven.\"*\n\nAfter singing, he would walk on, sighing. If someone offered him money, he would not accept it; if offered wine, he would not become drunk. On the first day of the second month of the Jiachen year, he suddenly died, and the people buried him. One night, a great wind and snow arose, and his grave split open—his body was gone.\n\nAt that time, Emperor Yuanzong of the Tang also passed away in his bedchamber in the second month of the Jia year. Only then did people realize that the \"second month in Jiangnan\" and the \"scattering plum blossoms\" referred to the time of Emperor Yuanzong’s passing. And they understood that the Returning Guest was none other than Lü Dongbin in disguise.\n\n*The Five Dynasties Supplement* records that Li Sheng of the Southern Tang rose from the Xu family to become sovereign. Earlier, there had been a children’s rhyme:\n*\"The carp of the Eastern Sea flies up to heaven.\"*\nThe Eastern Sea was the direction of Xu, and the carp signified Li.\n\n**The Conversion of the Tea House Maiden**\nDuring the restoration of the Tang, there was a family in Bianjing surnamed Shi who ran a tea house. Each day, they sent their young daughter to serve tea. Once, a beggar afflicted with leprosy, filthy and ragged, came straight to the shop and demanded a drink. The maiden treated him with respect and served him. For over a month, she showed no sign of weariness and even selected fine tea for him. Her father and brother saw this and beat her, but she paid it no mind.\n\nA few days later, the beggar returned, and the maiden served him with even greater care. The beggar said to her, \"Can you gather the leftover tea I leave behind?\" The maiden found it unclean and poured a little onto the ground. Suddenly, she smelled a strange fragrance and drank it at once—her spirit felt refreshed. The beggar said, \"I am the Immortal Lü. You may follow whatever you wish—wealth and honor, or long life—all can be yours.\"\n\nThe maiden, not understanding wealth and honor, only sought long life without want of material things. Patriarch Lü left her the *Fisherman’s Lyrics*:\n*\"At midnight and noon, nurture the essence of sun and moon,\nOpen and close the gate of the Mysterious Pass.\nLive thus,\nThrough all your years,\nAnd carefully refine yin and yang.\"*\n\nHe also transmitted an oral formula before departing. The maiden told her parents, who then regretted their actions, but no matter how they searched, they could not find him.",

      "translated_text": "One day, the immortal returned, and the Shi family detained him. The Master said, \"This year, both the Chinese and barbarians have suffered great losses. I fear those from afar remain unenlightened and shall journey north. Urge your guests to come,\" and then he departed.\n\nLater, the maiden came of age and married into the household of Commander Guan. She lived to one hundred and twenty years, her life adorned with abundance in both attire and sustenance—truly one who attained longevity and prosperity.\n\nDu Qiao, styled Erlang, lived between the late Tang and early Song. The Patriarch Lü encountered him in the imperial capital. Their bond deepened over time, never waning. Seeing his sincerity, the Patriarch transmitted to him the method of gathering gold from water—*a crucial technique of the alchemical arts*—and instructed him to cultivate it. Erlang then abandoned fame and fortune, built a thatched hut on Song Mountain, and followed the method to fruition, thereby attaining realization. Later, he again met the Patriarch Lü, who took him away.\n\nDu Liu Fang, styled Ziyi, was a native of Bianzhou. At the beginning of the Jianlong era, seeing the realm unsettled and warfare unceasing, he grew indifferent to officialdom. Admiring the character of Tao Yuanming, he turned his back on the city, faced the countryside, and built a small hermitage called Danqiu, where he dwelt. Though his hut stood amidst human habitation, his heart remained as remote as a secluded land.\n\nThe Patriarch Lü, wandering leisurely in Bianzhou under the guise of Master Hui, encountered Fang in the marketplace. He called him over for a lively drinking session. Fang sat beside him with solemn demeanor, and together they discussed the lofty figures of high antiquity and the rise and fall of nations. The Master said:\n\n*\"Within the seas and rivers, mountains bathed in slanting sunlight,\nFlowing waters, sparks of flint, fleeting time like hibiscus—\nI have witnessed the smoke and dust of six kingdoms,\nThe winds and rains from eight directions.\nYet one who will sweep away the gloom and polish the azure sky\nMust come from the land of Song.\nWhen the age is well-governed, men of talent will arise.\nWhy should we, my peers, fret in their stead?\"*\n\nFang was astonished and said, \"At first glance, I took you for a gallant hero, but now, hearing your discourse, you must be of the lineage of Anqi Sheng or Xianmen Gao. I beg you to enlighten me.\"\n\nMaster Hui then composed a song for him:\n\n*\"Watching the six kingdoms sink and rise in sorrow,\nI take my zither and wander beyond the divine realm,\nIntent on boiling white stones amidst mist and clouds,\nYet by chance, I meet a hermit in the dusty world.\"*\n\nHe further exhorted him: *\"Liu, Liu, heed my words well—time flies swift as a bird in flight. The secret of the Eight Jewels you already know; do not wait until the leaden carriage lies shattered and empty.\"*\n\nThe poem was lengthy, its essence one of gentle yet persistent encouragement. Fang bowed and received it. After the Patriarch Lü departed, Fang retreated into the deep mountains, diligently cultivating the secret arts, and never emerged for the rest of his life.\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Transformation of Magu into the Heavenly Consort**\n*(From the* Daoist Origins Compendium*: The Heavenly Consort is the water deity. Sima Guang said: \"Water belongs to the yin category, and its spirit is feminine. Moreover, 'Consort' signifies a heart as compassionate as a mother’s, matching the heavens in stature.\")*\n\nDuring the Lantern Festival in Yangzhou, an elder from Qingcheng surnamed Liu paid a visit to my thatched cottage. He claimed to have heard from the Patriarch Lü the tale of Magu’s transformation.\n\nBetween the late Tang and early Song, the Patriarch traveled south to Magu’s Altar, where he encountered Master Fangping. As they sat discussing the alchemical terrace, Magu suddenly arrived in graceful descent, her divine countenance and celestial bearing beyond description. The Patriarch Lü said to Fangping, \"The islands of the southeast are plagued by typhoons. The fierce and violent must be tempered with softness and harmony. I wish to recommend someone from the court of the Queen Mother of the West to manifest a merciful incarnation amidst the winds and waves of the sea, saving those in peril. This task cannot be undertaken lightly without spiritual attainment.\"\n\nHaving spoken, the Patriarch glanced at Magu. Fangping understood his intent and smiled faintly, saying, \"None but a bodhisattva’s precious raft could bear such a burden. Since ancient times, most female immortals have delighted in playful wanderings—blowing flutes and singing in Penglai and Langyuan, drinking wine and adorning themselves with flowers. The most accomplished among them merely traverse the sea islands to inspect the registers of immortals.\"\n\nMagu gave a cold laugh and parted her crimson lips: \"Such matters are for mortals to accomplish; it is only that there has been no place to set foot.\"\n\nThe Patriarch Lü said, \"The Lin family of Putian has accumulated profound virtue across generations—this is where the great roc spreads its wings.\" Magu immediately and resolutely pledged herself, awaiting the right conditions to descend and invest herself there.\n\nSeveral years passed. Hearing of the benevolence of Lin Pi (also recorded as Lin Yuan, the Regional Inspector) and his wife, who had borne nine virtuous sons—known as the Nine Governors Lin—Magu contemplated the surname *Ma* (麻). Removing the top part of the character (广, pronounced *yan*), she was left with *Lin* (林). Thus, she chose to be born into their family.\n\nIt was the *gengshen* year of the Southern Tang’s revival—the first year of Emperor Taizu’s Jianlong reign of the Song. On the evening of the twenty-third day of the third month, a red glow pierced the sky, and an extraordinary fragrance suffused the air as the Heavenly Consort was born. For a full month, she did not cry, so she was named *Mo* (默, \"silent\"). From birth, she was spiritually attuned, foreseeing the fortunes and misfortunes of others.\n\nAt eight, she studied under a tutor and grasped the meaning of all she read.",

The maiden told her parents, who then regretted their actions, but no matter how they searched, they could not find him.",

      "translated_text": "At thirteen, an elderly Daoist named Yuan Tong imparted to her the secret formulas of the subtle and profound. By sixteen, she glimpsed a talisman in a well, mastering transformation and the arts of exorcising evil to save the world, her powers responding to her will as though extensions of her mind. At times, she would ride the wind on spirit-journeys, soaring across the heavens and seas. At twenty, on the day before the Double Ninth Festival, she told her family: \"Tomorrow is the Chongyang Festival, and I wish to ascend the heights.\" She bid them farewell in advance. When the day arrived, she climbed directly to the highest peak of Meifeng, where dense clouds rolled over the ridges and white mist stretched across the sky. Celestial music filled the air as she rode the wind upward, leaving the onlookers sighing in awe. In the void, she met the Pure Yang Master, who approached with a sword at his waist and a whisk in hand. Smiling, he said to her: \"Sister, you have opened a new chapter—born into the Lin family, attaining the Dao in your youth. I entrust the shores of the Min Sea to your protection.\" Then he departed.\n\nThereafter, she repeatedly manifested her divine efficacy upon the seas. She was enfeoffed as the Heavenly Consort, and a temple was built for her on Meizhou Island. Whenever sailors encountered wind and waves upon the sea, they needed only to call out \"Niangma\" a few times, and divine lamps would flicker faintly amid the boundless mist and waves. Sometimes, she would appear in the form of Magu, seated upon the mast, her hair coiled into a single topknot with the rest cascading down, wielding a whisk to command the dragons, who obeyed her instantly. Thus, the winds would grow still, the waves calm, and the sails would glide smoothly across the waters. Her merit and virtue were lofty, and she attained the rank of Azure Radiance Primordial Sovereign. The imperial decrees bestowed upon her through the ages are too numerous to recount. The presence of the Heavenly Consort in the Min Sea is akin to that of the Great Being in the Southern Sea.\n\nYet people know of the Heavenly Consort’s divine efficacy but remain unaware that she is the incarnation of Magu, nor do they know that Magu’s advent was made possible by the efforts of Lü the Elder, who aided the perilous and rescued the drowning. Consider her conversation with Wang Fangping—seeking one to bring calm to the world’s waters, he was busiest when most at ease, coldest when most fervent, now urging, now persuading, until Magu was moved to act. The Heavenly Consort’s deeds reveal the heart of immortals who save the world, and through Lü the Ancestor, her merit became boundless.\n\nHai Chan recorded this, and Qian Xu inscribed it. It may be read as a chapter in the annals of immortals, not merely as a tale of praise.\n\n---\n\n**Six Additional Records of Immortal Traces (all from the early Song Dynasty)**\n\nIn the early years of the Jianlong reign, the third year of the Southern Tang’s revival, Emperor Taizu of the Song encountered Lü the Ancestor in the rear garden. Lü addressed the emperor as \"Vermilion Numinous Thearch\" and conversed with him for some time, though none of the attendants could hear their words. The emperor removed his cinnabar robe and jade belt to gift to him, but Lü vanished in an instant. The emperor then ordered a painter to depict his likeness on the Taiqing Tower.\n\nToward the end of the Jianlong reign, Lü the Ancestor transformed into an old man selling medicine in the markets of Chang’an, always carrying a large gourd. He gave medicine to those who sought it, regardless of whether they could pay, and his remedies were miraculously effective. When someone jokingly asked if he had the Great Return Elixir, he replied: \"I have one pill—worth a thousand strings of cash—and it is not like the herbs of the earth.\" The crowd dismissed him as mad. In the city, he would often laugh and scold people, saying: \"With money, you do not buy the Golden Elixir, but instead turn it all into clods of earth.\" One day, he shook his gourd until it was empty, leaving only one pill, radiant and luminous. Placing it on his palm, he said to the onlookers: \"For over a hundred years, not one person has been willing to spend money to buy this. What a pity! Now, I shall return it to the Red Thearch.\" With that, he placed the pill in his mouth. Five-colored clouds arose beneath his feet, and he departed toward the southeast. Only then did the people sigh in regret, but it was too late. His ascension coincided precisely with the passing of Emperor Taizu.\n\nThe *Classified Facts of Song History* records that Lü Dongbin, the Immortal, possessed swordsmanship and lived over a hundred years, his face as youthful as a child’s. Li Qi, the Recluse of Huayang, claimed to have been a court official during the Kaiyuan era, living for several centuries. He and Lü the Immortal once visited the abode of Chen Tuan (Chen Xiyi). Lü wrote on blue paper with cinnabar ink and had a young servant deliver it to Chen, who exchanged poems with him. (Li Qi appears earlier in the text.)\n\nThe *Song History* states: \"The transcendent Lü Chunyang was skilled in swordsmanship. Though over a hundred years old, he moved with the lightness of a youth, covering hundreds of miles in an instant. All regarded him as a divine immortal.\"\n\nThe *Hongjian Record* notes: \"Lü Dongbin lived over a hundred years, wielded swordsmanship, and had the face of a child. He moved with swift steps, visiting Ding Shaowei’s home. Shaowei was a native of Bozhou. He dwelled in the Huatong Valley and was as renowned as Chen Xiyi. Though their teachings differed and they never communicated, their aspirations were lofty, pure, and untainted—this they shared. Shaowei was adept at absorbing *qi* and often consumed elixirs. Though over a hundred years old, he remained robust and free of illness. Emperor Taizu summoned him to court, and he presented giant sesame, southern zhi, and black zhi. When asked the source of his vitality, he replied: 'Master Dongbin.' After staying for several months, he was sent back to the mountains.\"\n\nJiang Hui, a Daoist from Quanzhou, was of noble conduct and pure integrity. Lü the Ancestor visited him, but Jiang was away. Lü then inscribed a poem on Jiang’s door:\n\n*Drunkenly dancing and singing on the sea-bound mountain,*\n*The celestial gourd bears dew to bathe the golden elixir.*\n*Deep in the night, the crane pierces the autumn sky’s azure,*\n*A thousand miles of western wind—one sword’s chill.*\n\nAt the end, he signed: \"Written by the Master of the Supreme Palace upon visiting Master Jiang.\" When Jiang returned, he was astonished and said: \"The character *gong* (宫) with *wu shang* (无上) above it—this is Lü the Elder!\" He pursued him but could not catch up.\n\n**From *Marvelous Encounters in the Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Three of Lü’s Chronology**",

The Patriarch Lü would often manifest in the extraordinary form of Three Heads and Six Arms, clad in a yellow Daoist robe, seated upon a yellow crane. Through his dharmic countenance, he subdued the chieftains, who admired and returned to the Central Plains, thereby ceasing warfare and nurturing the people’s livelihood.\n\nThe Three Heads: the uppermost atop the crane’s crown, the middle a lion’s head, and the lower his original visage. The Six Arms: the left holding the Flying Dragon Sword, the right wielding the Coral Ruler, the middle two hands forming the Unobstructed Mudra, the left lower hand raised in the Five-Thunder Seal, and the right lower hand inverted in the Sword Seal.\n\nEmperor Taizong commanded the Daoist registrar Chen Jingyuan to propagate this image throughout the world.\n\n**Yellow Crane Tower**\nIn Jiangxia Prefecture, a man named Xin sold wine.

The gentleman drank and departed.\n\nThe next day, he returned unprompted, and Xin again served him wine. This continued for half a year, yet Xin never grew resentful. The gentleman said, “I owe you much for this wine, but have nothing to repay you.” He took a yellow tangerine peel and drew a crane upon the wall, instructing, “When patrons come to drink, have them clap and sing, and the crane will descend to dance—thus shall your wine debt be repaid.”\n\nThey tested it, and indeed, the crane danced. Word spread, and nobles from all directions flocked to witness the marvel, lavishing gold for wine. Over a decade, Xin amassed great wealth.\n\nOne day, the gentleman returned. Xin thanked him, saying, “Now I am rich—would you stay longer?” The gentleman laughed, “Did I seek this?” He took up a flute and played several tunes. Soon, white clouds descended from the sky, and the painted crane flew from the wall to his side.

Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou admired his noble character and bestowed upon him the title Master of White Clouds. First, he met Haichanzi, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao; then, the Master of Hemp Robe taught him the art of physiognomy. Later, he encountered Sun Junfang, who urged him to seclude himself on Mount Wudang. After a long sojourn, he returned to Mount Hua.\n\nDwelling at Cloud Terrace Abbey, he once rode a donkey through Huayin. Hearing that Emperor Taizu of Song had ascended the throne, he clapped his hands and laughed aloud: “The realm is settled from this day forth!” The emperor summoned him with a handwritten edict, but he declined, saying: “Let not the phoenix bear the immortal’s decree from the ninefold palace—my wild heart is already bound by the white clouds.” The emperor sighed in admiration without end.\n\nSecluded on Mount Hua, he styled himself the Daoist of Lotus Peak. Mastering the hibernating dragon method, he lay abed for days without rising. Lü Dongbin and Haichanzi often visited him, and Lü presented him with a poem:\n\n*The Daoist of Lotus Peak, lofty and pure,\nDwells in the Lotus Palace through the years,\nBy starlight bows to the jade hairpin’s chill,\nAt dawn the golden crucible blazes with dragon and tiger’s heat.*\n\nHe urged Chen to nurture his true nature in due time, preserving his perfection through sleep.\n\nEmperor Taizu repeatedly dispatched envoys to summon him to court. Unable to refuse, Chen emerged from the mountains and journeyed to the capital, where he concealed his true power. The emperor rejoiced and told his ministers: “Chen Tuan tends only to his own integrity, untouched by power or profit—truly a transcendent of the world beyond!” He bestowed upon him the title Master of Profound Repose and allowed him to return.\n\nLü Dongbin, Haichanzi, and the Master of Hemp Robe visited him again, teaching him the method of projecting his spirit. Chen received their instruction with reverence. When asked where he dwelled in the cliffs and streams, and in what chamber he slept, Chen smiled and recited:\n\n*My palace stands where Mount Hua soars highest,\nAt dawn I ride the morning wind through empty space.\nNo golden locks secure my terraces—\nWhite clouds seal them when I come.*\n\nIn the early *Duan’gong* era, he suddenly sent his disciples Huolongzi and Jia Desheng to carve a stone chamber at Zhangchao Valley.

      "translated_text": "He lived to the age of one hundred and eighteen.\n\n**The \"Breaking the Melon\" Prophecy**\nAt the beginning of the *Zhidao* era, Minister Zhang Bo and Lü Duan served at court together. In Zhang’s early years while residing at home, a Daoist visited him. Calling himself Elder Lü, he discoursed with Zhang on the *Book of Changes* and expounded the Mencian principles of preserving the mind and nurturing nature. Thereafter, Zhang’s literary skills advanced daily. The Elder inscribed a poem in clerical script as a parting gift, its final lines hinting at the emperor’s future intent to elevate him to high office:\n\n*Success shall come in the year the melon breaks.*\n\nWhen Zhang indeed rose to the rank of Minister, and sixteen years later passed away, the prophecy was understood as the \"breaking of the melon\" into its two eights.\n\n**The Verification of the Scholar Trees**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, Wang Dan served as President of the Bureau of Military Affairs. His father, Wang You, revered an image of Pure Yang with utmost devotion. One day, the Patriarch appeared and declared: “Your family has long cultivated hidden virtue; your descendants shall surely attain the rank of the Three Dukes.” He instructed Wang You to plant scholar trees as verification. Wang You then planted three scholar trees in his courtyard. When Wang Dan was later elevated to high office and enfeoffed as Duke of Wei, the prophecy was fulfilled.\n\n**Three Drunken Revels at Yueyang**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, Lü Dongbin encountered a colossal serpent in the White Crane Mountain pool, capable of expanding, contracting, and transforming to seize human souls. Seeing this, Lü rebuked it: “Wretched creature, cease your mischief! Follow me and be sated with the blood of the world’s wicked.” He beckoned it into his sleeve, where it coiled into pliable submission—thus becoming the Green Snake Sword. Lü then traveled to Yueyang, where he drank himself into a stupor on village wine under the guise of a wandering medicine peddler. His pills, priced at a thousand gold each, went unsold for three days. Ascending Yueyang Tower, he consumed one himself, then suddenly rose into the air. The crowd, astonished and envious, clamored to buy his wares. Lü smiled and said: “The Dao lies before your eyes, Penglai but a half-step away. Yet you hesitate at the trigger and let it slip past.” He then recited:\n\n*At dawn I roam the Northern Sea, by dusk the verdant Wu,\nThe green snake in my sleeve brims with bold qi.\nThrice drunk at Yueyang, none recognize me—\nI chant aloud and soar across Dongting Lake.*\n\n**The Miraculous Clay Jar**\nLü Dongbin wandered to Changsha, disguising himself as the Returning Daoist. Carrying a small jar, he begged for coins, amassing vast sums yet never filling the vessel. The people marveled at him. Seated in the marketplace, he declared: “Whoever can fill my jar with coins shall receive the Dao.” The crowd vied to toss in their money, yet the jar remained unfilled. A monk arrived, driving a cart laden with coins, and asked: “Can your jar hold these?” The Daoist assented. As the cart neared the jar, the coins clattered in one after another, vanishing entirely. The monk exclaimed: “Are you a divine immortal or a master of illusion?” The Daoist extemporized:\n\n*Neither god nor immortal,\nNeither art nor illusion.\nHeaven and earth have their end,\nMulberry fields ever shift.\nThe body was never truly mine—\nWhy cling to wealth?\nWhy not follow me,\nRiding the whale through the Han’s vast expanse?*\n\nThe monk, startled and doubtful, sought to seize him. The Daoist said: “If you begrudge these coins, I shall repay you.” He took a slip of paper, cast it into the jar, and invoked: “Return them swiftly.” After a long while, nothing emerged. “I must retrieve them myself,” he said, leaping into the jar and vanishing. The monk shattered the vessel, finding a slip of paper inscribed with a poem:\n\n*To seek the true, first know the true,\nYet seeing it, you fail to grasp.\nWe shall meet again with a smile,\nDriving your cart along the Dongping road.*\n\nThe monk departed in dismay. Upon reaching Dongping, he suddenly saw the Daoist, who said: “I have awaited you long.” Returning the cart, all the coins intact, he declared: “I am Lü Pure Yang. I once thought you teachable, but your attachment to money proves otherwise.” The monk, filled with remorse, could only apologize.\n\n**The Coins of Guangling**\nLater, Lü wandered through the markets of Guangling, scattering ten thousand coins across the streets. When he returned another day to inspect them, not a single coin had been taken. Only three remained: one fallen in the mud, another in the grass, and the third wedged in a crevice by a well, three inches from the rim. Finally, two men drawing water spotted the last coin and fought over it. Lü, standing nearby, laughed: “Is the world’s love of wealth truly so intense?”\n\n**The Courtesan’s Lodge in Yunzhou**\nDuring the *Xianping* era, a courtesan surnamed Hou in Yunzhou operated a lodge for travelers. Lü Dongbin, in disguise, sought lodging. He departed at dawn and returned at dusk, invariably drunk, yet after a month had not paid a single coin. Hou summoned him for tea. Lü said: “Master Zhongli once told me you were fit to hear the Dao.” Hou, uncomprehending, offered him wine instead. Lü drank without cease, and Hou grew increasingly displeased. Lü then extended his arm, revealing a golden bracelet beneath his sleeve. Removing one, he instructed her to sell it for wine. Hou, lured by the gold, asked: “Will you stay the night after drinking?” Lü agreed. He climbed onto the bed and snored loudly until midnight. Hou approached the bed, but Lü pushed her away. At daybreak, he had vanished. Where his hand had touched her, her skin bore a cinnabar imprint, faintly inscribed with the character *Lü*. Hou, awakened, exclaimed: “This was Lü the Immortal! Was it not a single misguided thought in a past life that brought me to this? Has he come now to deliver me?” She cut her hair, donned plain robes, and set out to find Lü Dongbin. On the road, she encountered He Xiangu, who led her into the Zhongnan Mountains, from which she never emerged.\n\n*(To observe Hou the courtesan—like Qin Cao, who upon hearing a single turning phrase from Su Dongpo, shaved her head and became a nun—is to witness the same decisive resolve. With such spirit, she was surely destined for the Dao.)*",

      "translated_text": "At the Yongkang Tavern\nIn Yongkang Prefecture there lived a man named Ni Geng, who had newly opened a tavern. Each day a Daoist would come, ascend the stairs, and demand wine. From dawn till dusk he drank over a *shi* of fine brew, yet his heroic spirit remained unquenched. The crowd marveled and gathered to watch. Ni asked for payment, but the Daoist glared in silence, then collapsed drunk. Ni sat guard over him. At the first drum of dawn, the Daoist suddenly rose, took up a brush, and inscribed the wall:\n\n*Like whale-sip and turtle-gulp, hundreds of cups—*\n*Who raises the jade mountain, who lays it low?*\n*When sober, twin sleeves stir the wind of heaven;*\n*A single crimson cloud rises from the sea.*\n\nAt the end he wrote: “Composed by the Daoist of Three Mountains, Pure Yang.” With a clod of earth he struck Ni’s face, then strode out the door. Gazing northeast, he saw a purple cloud flying toward him; he strode away with great steps and vanished in an instant. When the ink of the poem was scraped away, it had penetrated several *fen* into the wall. The clod of earth proved to be pure gold. From that time the tavern prospered greatly.\n\n*Jueshou (from Liu Gongfu’s* Poetic Conversations*)*\nHuang Jue, styled Mingxian, was a *jinshi* of the Jingde era and served as a palace attendant. He was renowned for his poetry and exchanged verses with Yang Wengong, Liu Ziyi, Zhang Xungong, and Song Xuangong. Once, while seeing a guest off beyond the capital gate, he entered an inn and encountered the Daoist Lü Dongbin, who said: “Next year we shall meet in Jiangnan.” Sure enough, the following year a Daoist arrived from Jiangnan. He gave Huang seven large coins, then ten, then three small ones, along with a piece of medicine about an inch long, saying: “Each year, grind this in wine and take it; you will remain free of illness.” With these words, he vanished like the wind. Huang lived to over seventy, and when the medicine was nearly gone, he wrote a poem:\n\n*Few days remain on the calendar by my bed;*\n*Counting on my fingers, next year I turn seventy-three.*\n\nThat very year he died.\n\n*The Mirror of Immortals* records Huang Jue’s name as Jueneng and places him in the Xuanhe era, also stating that outside the Eastern Capital gate, he first met Lü Dongbin, who said: “Next year we shall meet in Jiangnan.” Later, when Lü Dongbin traveled to Wuxing and met the courtesan Zhang Zhennu, she bathed each evening, lit incense, and earnestly prayed for liberation. He composed for her the tune *Pacing the Toad Palace*:\n\n*Later, when an official summons you to pour his wine,*\n*if he wishes to hear Daoist songs and melodies,*\n*sing my verses, and you will surely gain your freedom.*\n\nSoon after, Huang became prefect of Huzhou. When he inquired among the courtesans for one who could perform Daoist songs, none could respond—except Zhennu, who presented his verses. Huang was delighted and immediately granted her release from her register. Now, according to Liu Gongfu’s *Poetic Conversations*, Huang was a man of the Jingde era, over a hundred years before the Xuanhe era. Thus, while *The Mirror of Immortals* is rich in its accounts, its chronology remains unclear. One might wish to collate and verify these records, treating them as a chronicle from within the gourd, though this remains an unfulfilled aspiration. The compilers of *The Mirror* also intended to establish a clear chronology, but in doing so, they necessarily drew on old precedents to link events. In truth, the official who enjoyed Daoist songs was another prefect, not Huang. The compilers, misled by the phrase “meeting in Jiangnan,” conflated Huang Jue’s service in Jiangnan with the Xuanhe-era prefect of Wuxing.\n\n*Du Guo’s Kitchen Service (from* Records of the Strange*)*\nDuring the Tianxi era, a man named Guo Shangzao worked as a kitchen servant, scalding water and washing dishes at a tea shop by the Bianzhou Bridge. One day he met the Daoist Lü Dongbin and followed him for over a decade before returning. He said to Magistrate Zhao: “My allotted time is nearly spent. I beg you to provide a small coffin, and bore a hole in its head, inserting a bamboo tube to allow the passage of qi.” The magistrate laughed: “Once dead, how can there still be qi?” Guo did not reply. The next day he drew water to bathe, then lay beneath a scholar tree and died. He was buried by the riverbank. That autumn, the waters rose, and when Zhao went to inspect the grave, he retrieved the coffin—empty.\n\n(Guo was an unnamed kitchen servant, hence the name “Shangzao.” From this it is clear he was no willow immortal.)",

On the road, she encountered He Xiangu, who led her into the Zhongnan Mountains, from which she never emerged.\n\n*(To observe Hou the courtesan—like Qin Cao, who upon hearing a single turning phrase from Su Dongpo, shaved her head and became a nun—is to witness the same decisive resolve. With such spirit, she was surely destined for the Dao.)*",

I am well-versed in the classics, histories, and all schools of thought. Observing your appearance, you resemble Li Deyu. In the future, your rise and fall will mirror his.” Later, Ding Wei indeed rose to high office, but was demoted to assistant magistrate of Yazhou after being implicated in a scandal involving a female shaman—truly resembling Zhaorong.\n\nThe Monk of Dayun Monastery\nLü Dongbin once disguised himself as the recluse Hui and visited Dayun Monastery. He joined the communal meals in the refectory and remained for over a month without tiring of them. He then said to the abbot: “Your meals are exquisite, save for the lack of noodles.” He departed, but returned ten days later with a small portion of flour. After steaming several hundred buns, all the monks were sated, much to their astonishment. The abbot then prepared fine tea and invited the recluse to share it. By chance, he recited a line from Ding Wei’s poetry: *“Flowers part as the monk’s chopsticks break them; clouds follow the guest’s bowl, rounding it.”* The recluse remarked: “Though this line is fine, it does not fully capture the essence of tea.” He then inscribed a regulated verse:\n\n*A jade bud, a single shoot—peerless in rank,\nThe monks’ craft demands the utmost skill.\nRabbit-fur bowls, shallow, fragrant, white as clouds,\nShrimp-eye bubbles churn, red ripples swirl.\nBanishing sleep demons from desk and mat,\nAugmenting pure qi to permeate the flesh.\nHidden groves fall beyond mountain streams—\nUnwilling to transplant their roots to the capital.*\n\nThe monks marveled at its refined beauty.

      "translated_text": "During the Ganxing era, Xia Song served as an administrative aide in Taizhou. When torrential floods surged, he led his subordinates in prayer atop a mountain peak. Suddenly, a Daoist in yellow robes appeared, striding through the rain without his garments growing damp. Fixing his gaze on Song, he said: “Should you cultivate the Dao, you may ascend to the register of perfected beings.” Song made no reply. The Daoist smiled and added: “Yet you shall also rise to the highest ranks of the imperial court.” With that, he departed, and the waters receded in his wake. This was Lü Dongbin, who, en route to Jiangzhou, had taken note of Song’s sincerity and thus revealed himself to him. Later, Song indeed attained the position of Grand Councilor.\n\n**Releasing the Dead Fish**\nIn the early Tiansheng reign, Lü Dongbin visited a wineshop on Mount Lu. There, he saw a fish being scaled for minced fish. He said: “I can restore this fish to life.” The scaler replied: “If you can revive it, I shall release it.” The Master then placed a pellet of elixir into the fish’s belly. In an instant, the fish flipped and thrashed. Startled, the scaler cast it into the river, where it swam away with ease. As he turned to ask the Master’s name, a gust of wind passed, and Lü vanished—leaving only two circles traced upon the ground.",
