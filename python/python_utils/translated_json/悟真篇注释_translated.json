  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the *Awakening to Reality***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Awakening to Reality*. Three fascicles. Originally attributed to Xiangchuan Wumingzi (Weng Yuanming), i.e., Weng Baoguang, of the Southern Song period. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Awakening to Reality***\n\nThe Master once said to me: The Perfected One of Tiantai Mountain, having attained the Dao, received from the Supreme Emperor the title \"Purple Yang Perfected.\" In silent service to the imperial house, he often concealed or revealed himself in the world, yet none recognized him.\n\nIn his youth, he studied alongside my ancestor at the Imperial Academy. Though he did not pass the examinations, he was endowed from birth with a numinous root. While perusing Buddhist scriptures, he suddenly experienced the awakening of the bamboo-striking insight, instantly realizing non-arising and directly transcending into the true emptiness of the pure and tranquil nature-ocean.\n\nIn his later years, he encountered the Elder of Qingcheng in Chengdu, from whom he fully grasped the profound principles of the Golden Elixir. He thoroughly understood the mechanism of yin-yang mutual interaction, the principle of heaven and earth’s inversion and generation, and thus was able to cultivate reality and restore life, ascending into formlessness. Embracing the One and illuminating the mind, he attained perfect emptiness and quiescence.\n\nThus, his form and spirit were both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. His transformations were boundless, manifesting universally throughout the dharma-realm. Through this marvelous function, he broadly delivered the deluded.\n\nEven now, those who encounter the Way of nature and life are truly rare.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, he propagated the Buddhist Dharma alongside Liu Fengzhen’s disciples. Before entering quiescence, he left behind a gatha on non-arising. After his disciples cremated his remains, they obtained hundreds of relics, some as large as jujubes.\n\nSeven years later, his disciples arrived at Wangwu Mountain and again met the Perfected One as before. This demonstrated his form and spirit both wondrous, the meaning of nature and life both complete.\n\nThe Perfected One harbored a nature of compassion and benevolence, magnanimous and forthright. He exhausted principle and fulfilled nature to reach life, unifying the Three Teachings without distinction in marvelous function. Unwilling to cultivate goodness solely for himself, he composed the *Awakening to Reality* to instruct later learners.\n\nFirst, he used the Way of immortals and life to entice their cultivation, thus beginning the work with verses on the Golden Elixir’s arts. Finally, he employed the true suchness of empty nature to dispel their illusions, concluding the volume with Chan poems.\n\nThe essentials of the Golden Elixir lie in establishing the furnace and cauldron with the true yin of the two eights and true yang. Drawing the primordial qi into this furnace and cauldron, it transforms into a grain as large as a millet seed, called the \"Great One Containing Reality.\"\n\nThus, he first composed fifteen seven-character quatrains to represent the number of the two eights’ true yin and true yang. One five-character poem represents the single grain of the Great One.\n\nAfter obtaining this grain and returning it to the cinnabar field, one then circulates the fire, following the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams. Hence, he composed sixty-four quatrains corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*.\n\nThe fire-circulation practice lasts ten months, with bathing periods totaling twelve months. He added twelve *Xijiangyue* poems to correspond to the annual cycle of the celestial revolution.\n\nWhen the ten months of practice are complete, the embryo is perfected and transforms into pure yang qi. Thus, he composed a total of eighty-one regulated verses, symbolizing the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nAfter the form transforms into qi, one then embraces the Origin for nine years, refining qi into spirit, and merging spirit with the Dao. Thus, form and spirit become both wondrous.\n\nWondrous yet formless, spirit merges with the Dao, profound and unfathomable. Here, life and nature both reside in the ultimate source of emptiness and quiescence. Therefore, he concluded the volume with the Chan Way of nature.\n\nThus, the work first presents the great principles of the Golden Elixir in this sequence. The oral instructions on medicinal substances, fire phases, and secret formulas are all embedded within the verses; readers may seek understanding through the text.\n\nAfter its transmission spread widely, discrepancies and errors multiplied in the texts. Only the version preserved in the family of Lu Sicheng, grandson of the Duke of Longtu, is authentic—this being the edition personally transmitted by the Perfected One. The Perfected One also provided a detailed preface on his attainments at the end of the volume.\n\nWhile traveling through the grotto-heavens, I obtained this authentic text and corrected its errors. Only then did I comprehend the Perfected One’s intent in composing the work, its sequence of chapters, and its symbolic representation of the Golden Elixir’s methods.\n\nThough his words are concise, their principles are comprehensive; though his allusions are subtle, their analogies are intimate. Truly, this is the authentic guide for later learners and the essential compendium of the scriptural canon.\n\nNowadays, scholars often pursue heterodox and irrelevant paths to verification. Some recklessly misinterpret texts like *Celestial Court’s Supreme Treasure*, *Jade Flask Golden Elixir*, or *Primal Spirit Marvelous Elixir*, yet none attain the deep roots and firm foundation of true cultivation.\n\nThere was also Ye Wenshu, who used the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the Great Extension to explain and analyze the text. He appended diagrams at the end, calling it the *Outer Transmission of the Awakening to Reality*. This is like mistaking a curtain’s shadow for a horse or a screen’s silhouette for qian—trifling with the true scripture and increasing learners’ doubts.\n\nAlas! The Perfected One once said:\n*Not realizing one’s own errors,*\n*One teaches others the wrong path,*\n*Leading them astray in the sea of delusion for kalpas—*\n*How can such heartless deception be endured?*\nWas he not referring to Wenshu?\n\nHow could he know that a single grain of the Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of the Great Ultimate? The sage borrows the substances of the two eights, gathering their qi in a single moment to transform it into a grain. Ingesting it, one immediately ascends to sagehood.\n\nThe Perfected One said:\n*Within a single time-period, the elixir is complete.*\nAnd again:\n*Swallowing a grain of Golden Elixir,*\n*One realizes my life is not decreed by heaven.*\nHow could these be empty words?\n\nWenshu, failing to grasp this principle, mistakenly rejected the \"single moment.\" If it were not a single moment, would it not require three years or nine? Yet the Perfected One spoke of \"a brief moment’s effort yielding eternal ease and boundless joy.\"\n\nHe also misconstrued the \"single grain\" as a daily elixir, wrongly citing Zhenyizi’s saying of \"consuming one grain per day.\"\n\nYet if three years or nine were required, one would need to consume over a thousand grains—how could the Perfected One have deceived others with his words of \"a single moment\"? From these two points alone, it is clear that Wenshu failed to grasp the art of the Golden Elixir. Thus, his reckless annotations abound in errors, unaware that the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the *Dayan* are in fact the timing for firing and symbolic representation. To seek the supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir through symbols is like invoking rain by painting dragons or sating hunger with drawn cakes—how could it not be difficult?\n\nThough dull-witted, I follow the Perfected One’s footsteps. Having received the true response, I dare not forget it day or night. How could I sit idly by while red and purple distort the vermilion, unable to expand the Perfected One’s meaning and clarify it? Thus, unafraid of heavenly retribution, I boldly reveal the celestial mechanism. Faithfully adhering to my master’s secret instructions, I annotate the true text, dividing it into three volumes:\n\nThe **upper volume** speaks of the art of strengthening the army to conquer the belly, thereby harvesting the gold.\nThe **middle volume** expounds the method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people, thereby firing the furnace.\nThe **lower volume** reveals the Dao of the immortal embracing the One, thereby entering the primordial form.\n\nEach explains its practical matters without the slightest omission. For those of like mind, it will be clear and evident, directly verifying the supreme Dao without being misled by heterodox schools or crooked streams.\n\n**Preface by the Nameless One**\n\n**Annotations on the *Wuzhen Pian*, Volume One**\n*Commentary by Weng Yuanming of Xiangchuan*\n\nIn refining the Golden Elixir, one always begins at the first moment of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the first yang stirs. Seated firmly at the *kuigang* position, ascending three tiers of the altar, one grasps the Dragon on the left to stabilize the cauldron’s string and seizes the Tiger on the right to refine the qi’s timing. One civil, one martial, they contend and battle at the Mysterious Gate. One departing, one arriving, they fiercely struggle at the Gate of the Female. Breath aligns with the clepsydra’s marks, the count matches the celestial cycle—no deviation by a hair’s breadth, no regret over the slightest error. Thus, in a brief moment, three battles conclude, and the Elixir Pearl is instantly seized and ingested. Hence, it is called the art of strengthening the army to achieve victory.\n\nThe \"battle\" is the union; the \"army\" is the Dragon and Tiger. Obtaining the Golden Elixir within a single time-period is the art of conquering the belly. Thus, the *Western Florescence Scripture* states: *\"The ultimate victory of strengthening the army lies in the cultivation of the Mysterious Pearl.\"* Therefore, the Perfected One first presents twenty-eight seven-character verses to clarify the numbers of the Dragon and Tiger, and one five-character verse to signify obtaining a grain of Golden Elixir in a single time-period. This is why I have made it the upper volume—to elucidate the meaning of strengthening the army to achieve victory. The workings of harvesting the Golden Elixir are thus brilliantly clear.\n\n**Fifteen Quatrains in Seven-Character Verse**\n\nNot seeking the great Dao, one strays from the path—\nEven with worthy talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of light pass like a spark from stone,\nA lifetime’s existence floats like a bubble on water.\nChasing profit and rank for glory and display,\nOne disregards the body’s withering and decay.\nTry asking: can mountains of gold piled high\nEver buy back what is eternally gone?\n\nWhat men value most in the world is wealth and nobility—these are what all desire. Thus, people of the world exhaust their nature and destiny, fulfilling their lifelong ambitions, competing to pursue them with zeal. Observing their motivations, they are nothing more than indulgence in profit, rank, sensuality, and beauty—truly the spears and halberds that slay life, the shackles that bind the body. Why is this? Because worldly people, ignorant of the heart of virtue and power or the greatness of nature and destiny, only covet profit and rank, daily indulging in delusion, drowning in the river of love, adrift in the sea of desire. Right and wrong, self and others, wage war in their breasts; joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, ravage their bodies. Thus, corpse-demons shorten their years, cold and heat consume their complexion. Unaware, they live a fleeting life, like a flash on water’s edge; a hundred years of light pass in an instant, like a spark from stone. Even if one amasses gold by the bushel and jade by the mountain, when the time comes, can one buy back the body, preventing it from becoming a nest for ants? Alas! Before life’s end is announced, the spirit has already entered another shell. As the True Lord of Empty Serenity said: *\"Unenlightened in this life, one enters another shell, cycle after cycle, unaware.\"*\n\nAlas! Rather than casting oneself into a different species, why not abide in the great Dao? If the Dao is attained and the work completed, the body transcends the azure heavens, riding clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, roaming the boundless, forever unchanged in oneself, bearing the title of Perfected One—this is the season of a true man’s fulfillment, the day of utmost joy and glory. But those entangled in mundane affairs, their hearts mired in dust, falling into the world’s net—even with the worthy talent of Confucius and Mencius, or the splendor of Su and Zhang—are no more than wandering souls on earth, shadowy ghosts of walking corpses. How can they be called true men? Thus, the Perfected One first chants this poem, addressing those of exceptional insight, that they may awaken from a single word, swiftly seek the great Dao, escape the path of delusion, and engage in the work of non-action—only then is one a true man. All else is unworthy.\n\nThough man’s life may span a hundred years,\nLongevity or early death, success or failure—none can foreknow.\nYesterday, one rode through the streets on horseback;\nToday, one lies in a coffin as a sleeping corpse.\nWealth and wife are left behind, no longer yours;\nThe sins one carries will follow—who can deceive themselves?\n\nMan’s longevity or early death, success or failure, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all are silently determined by one’s inherent allotment. How can they be measured or foreknown? Man’s lifespan is roughly a hundred years; even seventy is rare. With a fragile body of limited years, one toils endlessly after the boundless—is this not laborious? With a single breath gone, one departs forever, destination unknown. Is this not a great sorrow?\n\nThus, one who but yesterday rode a horse through the streets may today lie as a sleeping corpse, with no certainty that the outgoing breath will return. At such a moment, though one may have held the highest rank, enjoyed ten thousand bushels of emolument, possessed priceless treasures, or kept a beauty who could topple cities—all must be cast aside, reduced to nothing, no longer one’s own. The only companion that cannot be deceived and must accompany one is the karma of sins committed in life. Hence the saying: “A thousand things will not go with you; only karma follows the body.”\n\nMaster Cao’s verse declares:\n*Alas, the toil and turmoil of human life—*\n*Like a burning house, the dusty world entangles day by day.*\n*Suddenly, the three-inch breath in the throat is cut,*\n*And spirit, soul, and consciousness scatter and dissolve.*\n*Though wife and children wail and plead in vain,*\n*A thousand cries, ten thousand calls—none will turn the head.*\n*No matter how shrewdly one schemes in life,*\n*Lying in the barren mound, the wise man is lost.*\nTruly, these are words of truth.\n\nThe great elixir is not sought in vain when encountered. For those who wish to escape the wheel of rebirth and not fall into the snares of the world, nothing surpasses the golden elixir of the great medicine as the sacred ladder to ascension and the swiftest path to transcendence. The Way is most simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice it, may at once ascend to the rank of the sages. Yet the highest sages guard it in secrecy, forbidding careless disclosure. It is transmitted only through oral instructions to the worthy, never recorded in writing—thus, though difficult to encounter, it is easy to accomplish. Without diligent seeking and earnest resolve, with sincerity that moves the highest heavens, scarcely one or two have ever attained it.\n\nXie Ziran, longing for this Way’s rarity, yearned for a true master on Penglai. With utmost sincerity, he emptied his coffers, prepared a boat, and, heedless of the perilous waves and vast deeps, set forth without fear. Moved by his devotion, the sea god spoke: “The weak waters of Penglai stretch thirty thousand leagues; not even a mustard seed may float upon them. Where do you think to go?” He directed him instead to Master Sima Ziwei, who dwelt on Red City Mountain. Turning his boat, Xie sought out Red City and indeed found Ziwei, who transmitted the Way to him. After but a few years of cultivation, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Ah! Sincerity issuing from within evokes response without—nothing is beyond reach. If one can set the heart and establish resolve thus, how can the Way of the golden elixir fail to be achieved? The Way does not betray man; man constantly betrays the Way.\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*The Way is neither distant nor near—*\n*It is entrusted only to the worthy.*\nWithout steadfast sincerity and ardent longing, how can one encounter it? To encounter it and not refine it is utter folly.\n\nThe secret essentials of the golden elixir are indeed hard to come by. Those who do encounter them possess innate immortal bones and the profound hidden virtue of their ancestors. Moreover, one must command great wealth and gather three companions to accomplish this principle. The enlightened know this well, though it is difficult to express. Thus, when Wang Chongzhao met Master Haichan and received the Way of the golden elixir, lacking the means to begin, he journeyed to Luoyang to seek the aid of Lords Han and Fu. With their support, he attained the Way and departed. If one encounters this Way and finds capable companions of one mind to cultivate together, yet refuses to act, such a one is truly the most foolish of fools.\n\nThe Immortal Elder’s poem to Master Liu says:\n*I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*\n*Why not gather your heart and refine the lead?*\n*Let not the candle be blown out by the wind,*\n*For in the six paths of rebirth, heaven cannot be blamed.*\nThese words speak truly.\n\nTo learn immortality, one must learn the immortality of heaven. Immortals are of several ranks: those whose yin spirits are most numinous yet formless are ghost immortals. Those who live in the world free from illness and sorrow, enjoying long life, are human immortals. Those who soar through the air and walk through mist, neither hungering nor thirsting, unharmed by cold or heat, roaming the sea isles and living forever without death, are earth immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth, who cast no shadow when walking in sun or moon, pass through metal and stone without hindrance, transform endlessly, now old, now young, now hidden, now manifest, now present, now gone—gathering to form a body, dispersing to become qi—whose depths the milfoil and tortoise cannot fathom, whose mysteries even spirits and gods cannot know, are heaven immortals.\n\nThus, Master Yin Zhen says: Those who can extinguish desire, cultivate embryonic breathing, move the spirit, shed the husk, enter samadhi, and cast off the corpse, relying on yin to be born without decay, are lower-grade immortals. Those who receive the talismans of the Three Armors, the covenant of the Great One, the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, or the arts of the sword and corpse-liberation, and thereby attain the Way, become immortals of the Southern Palace, dwelling in the various grotto-heavens as middle-grade immortals. Those who refine the great medicine of the golden elixir and attain the Way, ascending bodily to heaven, become the supreme, limitless, highest-grade heaven immortals.\n\nThe Immortal Elder exhorts those who cultivate the truth to establish a resolute and extraordinary resolve, sever all distracting thoughts, concentrate the spirit, and delight in non-action. Rejecting the lesser and middling immortals, they should aspire to realize the supreme, limitless, highest-grade heaven immortal. Only the golden elixir is the most authentic path.\n\nAmong the seventy-two grades of elixirs, the Way to learn heaven immortality is simple and easily accomplished—only the golden elixir, the supreme Way, is most authentic. This is the creation of something from nothing, not the later-born five metals, eight stones, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, yin and yang, arsenic, autumn stone, or herbs and trees of the world, nor the fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humors of the body—all of which are the creation of something from something. It is the primordial qi of the undifferentiated chaos before heaven. By methodically gathering and refining it within a single two-hour period, it coalesces into a grain the size of a millet seed, called the golden elixir, also known as true lead, yang elixir, true mercury, true unity essence, true unity water, water-fire, or the true qi of the Great One. When ingested, it instantly elevates one to the rank of the sages. This is the highest examination, the wondrous Way of heaven immortals, rarely heard of in the world.\n\nWhen the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil. The true unity qi emerges before heaven and earth, blending within the formless void—dim and indistinct, profound and obscure, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable by grasp. How then does it condense into a grain the size of a millet seed?\n\nThe sage gives form to the formless through the substantial, manifests the invisible through the visible. That which is substantial and takes form is true yin and true yang. These formless, kindred substances—void and nonexistent—are the primal qi of the crescent moon’s first phase, possessing qi yet lacking substance. When the two take shape in relation to one another, a single entity arises: this is the true unity qi, coalescing into a millet-seed pearl.\n\nAs the scripture says: *\"The primordial single treasure-pearl resides within the empty mystery, vast as a millet grain.\"* This is its proof. Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages used true yin and true yang as metaphors for the crescent qi of the Green Dragon and White Tiger, or likened them to true lead and true mercury.\n\nIn the verses of the immortals, the dragon is further named the Crimson Dragon, the Thunder Dragon, the Celestial Soul, the Qian House, the Qian Crucible, the Jade Tripod, the Fusang, the Jade Pool, the half-moon of the lower crescent, the Eastern Yang, the Eldest Son, the Vermilion Mercury, the Cinnabar Tripod, the Li Sun, the Scarlet Phoenix—all variations of the Green Dragon’s single name. The tiger is likewise called the Black Tiger, the Dui Tiger, the Earthly Soul, the Kun Position, the Kun Tripod, the Metal Tripod, the Metal Crucible, the Hua Peak, the half-moon of the first crescent, the Western River, the Youngest Daughter, the Black Lead, the Crescent-Moon Crucible, the Kan Moon, the Black Tortoise—all variations of the White Tiger’s single name.\n\nThe dragon’s crescent qi is named the Alchemical Maiden, the Wood Mercury, the Azure Maiden, the Vermilion-Ensheathed Mercury, Emotion, the Yellow Sprout, the Flowing Pearl, the Green-Clad Maiden, the Golden Crow, the Li Maiden, the Female Dragon, the True Fire, the Sixteen-Year-Old Alchemical Maiden, the Jade Mushroom, the Wood Fluid—all one and the same. The tiger’s crescent qi is called True Lead, the Metal Duke, the Metal Essence, the Metal in Water, the Silver in Water, Nature, the Golden Flower, the White Snow, the White-Clad Gentleman, the Talisman Water, the Nine-Three Gentleman, the Jade Hare, the Kan Son, the Male Tiger, the Knife-Tip—all one and the same.\n\nWhen the two substances meet and nature and emotion unite, these two substances are the dragon and tiger. The Green Dragon in the east belongs to wood, which engenders fire; the dragon’s crescent qi, as fire, is Emotion, belonging to the south, called the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger in the west belongs to metal, which engenders water; the tiger’s crescent qi, as water, is Nature, belonging to the north, called the Dark Warrior. Dragon-wood, tiger-metal, nature-water, and emotion-fire constitute the four images, gathering at the central palace to return their merit to wu and ji, thereby forming the elixir. The elixir is earth. These are the true five phases, hence it is said: *\"When the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.\"*\n\nOriginally, with wu and ji as the matchmakers, husband and wife are thus made to harmoniously unite. The Wood Dragon in the east and the Metal Tiger in the west are separated—how can they be made to unite and generate transformation? The matchmaker is the Yellow Dame. Only by driving the dragon with the left hand and steering the tiger with the right can they be made to merge. The dragon and tiger, east and west, are brought together by the Yellow Dame; without her matchmaking, how could they be joined as husband and wife in joyful union?\n\nNow, when the true unity qi is stirred and coalesces into the golden liquid returning elixir, this is truly the image of the external medicine. Only after the work is accomplished and one ascends to the Jade Palace, enveloped in ninefold radiance, does one ride the auspicious simurgh. After ingesting this golden elixir, there remains the labor of ten months to refine form into qi, followed by nine years of embracing the one to transform qi into spirit. When both form and spirit attain perfection and merge with the Dao in truth, one rides the simurgh and crane through the ninefold radiance to ascend and pay homage at the Jade Palace.\n\nThis method is true within the true, wondrous beyond wonder—all because I alone differ from others. This Way is most divine, most sagely, most simple, most easy, most noble, most exalted, profound beyond profundity, wondrous beyond wonder, rarely heard of in the world. The immortal transcends his kind, rises above the multitude, and alone grasps its profound meaning.\n\nImmortal Chongzhao said: *\"Of all the Daoists in the world, none can be commended for the Way of the Golden Elixir—only Pingshu alone.\"* He is Mount Tai, the river and sea; how dare the mere streams and puddles presume to compare?\n\nKnowing that inversion arises from li and kan, who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest? Li is yang and resides in the south, yet is called female—outwardly yang but inwardly yin—termed true mercury. Kan is yin and resides in the north, yet is called male—outwardly yin but inwardly yang—termed true lead.\n\nThe immortal said: *\"The sun dwells in the li position yet is called female; the moon pairs with the toad palace yet is male. If you do not grasp the meaning of this inversion, do not presume to discourse on such lofty matters with shallow understanding.\"* This speaks of kan’s male and li’s female, like the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare, mercury within cinnabar and silver within lead. It also refers to heaven’s Yellow Son and earth’s Dark Maiden. All these point to the crescent qi of the first phase.\n\nHost and guest: yang, noble and elevated, resides on the left as the host; yin, humble and low, resides on the right as the guest. Li is fire, which flames upward, sharing wood’s nature of floating—both belong to yang, hence the host. Kan is water, which moistens downward, sharing metal’s nature of sinking—both belong to yin, hence the guest.\n\nThis is the natural order of the common Dao. Yet now li is reversed to become female, kan reversed to become male; the host is reversed to become the guest, and the guest reversed to become the host—is this not inversion? Thus it is said: *\"Only when one knows inversion through li and kan / Who discerns floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\"*\n\nTo fix host and guest is to take the crescent qi of the two phases as the inverted host and guest, not the host and guest of the common Dao—hence they are called host and guest.\n\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-wrapped mercury,\nThe jade pool first descends with silver in water.\nThe golden crucible: gold is a yin substance, yet within the crucible resides yang qi—this is the image of yin containing yang, the White Tiger. The jade pool: jade is a yang substance, yet within the pool resides yin qi—this is the image of yang containing yin, the Green Dragon. Mercury within cinnabar is the crescent qi of the dragon.\n\nIf the cultivator of the elixir wishes to use the tiger to retain the dragon’s qi, they must first drive the dragon to the tiger. Only then will the two qi intertwine, their natures harmonizing. Through refinement and firing, the true essence of the One naturally congeals.\n\nFire, moreover, is the untransmitted marvel of the sages. At its highest, it reaches eighty-four thousand *li*; at its lowest, it stirs even in the depths of the North Pole’s great abyss. When kindled, it becomes fire—thus the sage uses it to complete the elixir, while the fool invites disaster.\n\nThe divine work of firing does not last the whole morning—\nA single wheel of sun emerges from the deep pool.\nFire here refers to the crescent qi of the two phases, the beginning of a day. *Zi* is the origin of the six yangs, hence called \"morning\" or \"sun at *zi*.\" When the sage moves the elixir-fire with divine skill, in less than half an hour, the true essence of the One is obtained—a grain like millet, appearing in the Northern Sea, its light piercing the curtains, like a single blazing sun rising from the deep pool. It is not the whole morning, for within one hour, the golden elixir is instantly achieved. This describes the external medicine’s symbolic form.\n\nThe tiger leaps, the dragon soars—waves surge, winds roar;\nAt the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.\nFruit ripens on the branch in due time,\nThe child in the womb—how could it be different?\n\nThis verse speaks of the true essence of the One, whose creation lies outside—called the golden elixir, true lead, or true earth. When swallowed into the five viscera, it becomes the yang elixir. Here, the tiger is the golden elixir. The dragon is one’s true qi. The wind and waves are the qi surging from the primordial sea, its turbulence like waves, its motion like wind. The \"central true position\" is the golden womb’s divine chamber within the elixir, where the elixir coalesces. The Mysterious Pearl is the infant, also called the golden liquid returning elixir.\n\nThe golden elixir is formed from the primordial chaos before heaven and earth, thus it is the mother, the sovereign, the lead—called the tiger. One’s true qi, born after heaven and earth, is the child, the minister, the mercury—called the dragon. When the golden elixir enters from without and is swallowed into the abdomen, one’s true qi rises from the lower sea of qi like wind and waves, converging eagerly—like a minister attending the sovereign, a child longing for its mother. Their mutual affinity is evident. When dragon and tiger unite in the divine chamber’s earthen cauldron, the sacred embryo forms—no different from fruit ripening on the branch or a child in the womb. After ten months, the embryo matures, and the spirit naturally emerges through transformation.\n\nThe Southern and Northern lineages reverse the hexagrams’ images;\nMorning and evening firing align with the celestial pivot.\n\"South and North\" refer to the *zi* and *wu* hours; \"lineage source\" means the critical beginning. \"Morning and evening\" pertain to the principles of day and night. *Zi* is the head of the six yangs, hence \"morning,\" corresponding to the *Zhun* hexagram’s duty—this is the time for advancing fire. *Wu* is the source of the six yins, hence \"evening,\" corresponding to the *Meng* hexagram’s duty—this is the time for advancing water. Each day, two hexagrams govern their duties, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Jiji* and *Wei*, cycling endlessly—hence \"reversing the hexagrams’ images.\"\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: *\"At dawn, *Zhun* governs its duty; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each have one hexagram, used in proper sequence. From *Jiji* to *Wei* at dusk, the end returns to a new beginning.\"*\n\nEach day, two hexagrams govern their duties, along with the four hexagrams of the male and female, totaling sixty-four hexagrams in a month. Each hexagram has six lines, so sixty-four hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the days of a year including intercalary months. *Qian*’s first nine begins with *Kun*’s first six; *Qian*’s count is thirty-six, so six lines total two hundred sixteen. *Kun*’s first six begins with *Qian*’s first nine; *Kun*’s count is twenty-four, so six lines total one hundred forty-four. Together, they sum to three hundred sixty, the degrees of a celestial cycle.\n\nThe movements of the sun and moon—conjunction, ascent, descent—do not exceed the bounds of the hexagrams’ lines. The moon moves swiftly, completing one celestial cycle in a month. The sun moves slowly, completing one cycle in a year. The \"celestial pivot\" is the pivot of the Dipper. Each day and night, it completes one cycle, shifting position once a month. For example, the first month aligns with *yin*, the second with *mao*.\n\nTake the first month aligning with *yin*: if the sun has not yet passed the official division, *yin* is placed over *hai*, reaching *you* to find *zi*—this is the first month, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to *you*, marking the true *zi* hour. If the sun has passed the official division, *yin* is placed over *xu*, reaching *yin* to find *wu*—this is the first month, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to *yin*, marking the true *wu* hour.\n\nThe superior adept, the perfected person, understands the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the ascent and descent of yin and yang. They practice the *zi-wu* firing with day and night, adjusting numbers according to the Dipper’s position, naturally aligning with celestial degrees—hence \"aligning with the celestial pivot.\" The marvel of the supreme Dao lies herein.\n\nOne must know that great reclusion resides in the marketplace;\nDo not seek solitude in the deep mountains.\n\nThe great elixir of golden cinnabar is possessed by every household, unbound by marketplace or court. Yet how many recognize the dragon when they see it, or the tiger when they meet it? How few reverse their practice to cultivate it! In but a moment, a precious pearl coalesces, large as a grain of millet. Held in the palm, it radiates iridescent light. Swallowed into the belly, the jeweled palace is renewed.\n\nThe great Dao hides in the marketplace—those in the mountains know not. How could those of solitary yin and scant yang ever grasp this Way? The yellow sprout and white snow are not hard to find; the enlightened must rely on deep virtue and conduct. The Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on earth: the dragon’s latent *qi* is called the yellow sprout, the tiger’s latent *qi* is called the white snow. The root of the great elixir truly lies here.\n\nThe Way is most simple, the matter not distant. Yet without great merit and mighty deeds, none may encounter a true master to transmit its profound essentials. This origin begins in emptiness and gives birth to the One *qi*; the One *qi* transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. The dragon, wood, engenders fire; the tiger, metal, engenders water—wood, fire, water, metal: these are the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols unite to form the elixir, and the elixir’s completion depends on earth. Earth has no fixed form; it divides its position among the four directions and four seasons. Without earth of the four seasons, the four sequences do not proceed, and the myriad things do not arise. Thus the Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on earth.\n\nHow could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from *ren*? *Ren* is water, the true One *qi*. The true One *qi* is the true One water, born before heaven and earth, transforming into the yang dragon and yin tiger. When dragon and tiger unite, the elixir is formed. The elixir is earth; the dragon is wood; the tiger is metal. Metal, wood, and earth are called the Three Natures, and the Three Natures are the Three Origins. The Three Origins do not depart from the transformation of the true One water.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams: the One *qi* first transforms into heaven, called *qian*, the father. Next it transforms into earth, called *kun*, the mother. *Qian*, with its yang *qi*, seeks *kun*’s yin *qi*: at the first seeking, it gives birth to the eldest son, *zhen*; at the second seeking, the middle son, *kan*; at the third seeking, the youngest son, *gen*—this is *qian*’s yang *qi* uniting with *kun*’s *qi* to give birth to the three yang. Then *kun*, with its yin *qi*, seeks *qian*’s yang *qi*: at the first seeking, it gives birth to the eldest daughter, *xun*; at the second seeking, the middle daughter, *li*; at the third seeking, the youngest daughter, *dui*—this is *kun*’s *qi* uniting with *qian*’s *qi* to give birth to the three yin. These too do not depart from the transformation of the true One *qi*. Hence it is said: “How could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from *ren*?”\n\nNot only the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams do not depart from the true One *qi*. Since the opening of heaven and earth, all things with form and name arise from this and transform. The True One Master said: “The essence of the true One is the mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang, the origin of water and fire, the ancestor of the sun and moon, the source of the Three Powers, and the progenitor of the Five Phases. The myriad things rely on it for birth and completion; the thousand spirits depend on it for joy and sorrow. As for the lofty heavens and profound earth, the grottoes and famous mountains, the mysterious images and numinous spirits, the immortals, buddhas, worthies, and sages, the winds and rains, the dark and bright moons, the spring, summer, autumn, and winter—before any sign appears, all arise from this leaden *qi* and transform.”\n\nFor those who cultivate the elixir, if they obtain the true One water, then all matters are complete. The refined numinous essence is hard for others to recognize; when all yin demons are dissolved, ghosts dare not approach. Swallowing the true One millet into the cinnabar field and circulating the fire for ten months burns away all the host of yin. The body transforms into a pure yang immortal, and the yin demons, corpse-ghosts, flee without refuge.\n\nShould one wish to leave secret formulas among humankind, none have met a *ziqi*—how could one find another like oneself? The yellow lead must be sought with intent; let not the days slip by in vain. Simply capture the earthly *po* to seize the vermilion mercury, and the celestial *hun* will naturally restrain the watery metal. This may be called: “When the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit”; it may be said: “When virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.”\n\nThe true lead is the golden elixir, the primordial One *qi*, akin to the bright moon, now full, now crescent, sharing its origin with the river tides and the lunar palace. The earthly *po* is the external medicine—the white tiger. The internal medicine is the golden elixir. The celestial *hun* is the external medicine—the green dragon. Internally, it is the body’s own vermilion mercury; externally, it is the dragon’s latent *qi*. Internally, it is the golden elixir, also called silver in water. This speaks of the internal and external medicines.\n\nWhen the sun has passed one’s fate, then life follows in extinction. We must seek a master with intent, swiftly refine the golden elixir, and transcend life and death. Simply capture the tiger’s soul, and the dragon will naturally restrain its *po*. The two *qi* swallow each other and produce the golden elixir. Once the golden elixir is obtained, use this elixir to capture one’s true mercury; the true mercury transforms the golden elixir and completes the sacred embryo.\n\nWhen the true dragon and true tiger within are subdued, the mundane dragon and mundane tiger without naturally submit. When the gods, spirits, ghosts, and *po* within the body are sanctified, the obstructive ghosts and stagnant spirits beyond the world bow in reverence. None but those of abundant Dao and flourishing virtue can achieve this.\n\nOnce you know your life spans as heaven and earth, afflictions can no longer arise in the heart. The body transforms into pure yang, its longevity matching heaven and earth, roaming beyond the mundane while dwelling freely in the world. All thoughts dissolved, afflictions cannot touch the heart.\n\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking herbs and plants is even further from the truth. Yin and yang of the same kind return to mutual resonance; the two eights in balance naturally unite in affinity.\n\nThe Three Yellows, Four Spirits, minerals, metals, herbs, and plants are all post-celestial turbid substances—how could they transform the formed into the formless? Thus, the *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: \"External flesh cannot form the embryo; stitched flowers cannot bear fruit.\"\n\nThe qi of True Unity arises before heaven and earth, profound and unfathomable, beyond measure. Through the union of the two eights—substances of the same kind in perfect balance—they bind and intertwine in mutual resonance, stirred into manifestation.\n\n\"Same kind\" refers to the emotion within non-emotion, the color within non-color—like eight ounces of crow’s liver and half a catty of hare’s marrow.\n\nWhen the sun glows red at the bottom of the pool, yin demons vanish; when the moon shines white atop the mountain, the medicinal sprout is renewed.\n\nThe pool’s yin and the sun’s yang: the red sun at the pool’s bottom is yang within yin. Yang within yin is pure yang, devoid of yin qi, so yin demons perish—this is the tiger’s initial infant qi, called red lead. The white moon atop the mountain is yin within yang, the dragon’s initial latent qi, called black mercury.\n\nThe sage takes these two substances, refines them in a single hour into a grain of yang elixir, which coalesces in the Northern Sea, blazing like the sun, its light piercing the curtains. At once, it is drawn into the abdomen to ignite one’s yin mercury. The yin mercury—all the body’s yin and perverse qi—is entirely consumed, just as when the dawn sun rises from the Eastern Sea, its radiance dispels all demons.\n\nOne’s own yin mercury, from the summit of the lower peak of the cinnabar field, newly receives the qi of the yang elixir, gradually congealing and sprouting tenderly—hence the \"new medicinal sprout.\" Like the moon at the first crescent, exchanging light with the sun, it newly receives the sun’s qi at dusk, casting a faint glow on the western mountain’s *geng* peak, shaped like an eyebrow—its light tender, the medicinal sprout renewed. This allegory illustrates the imagery of the internal and external medicines.\n\nPeople of this age must recognize true lead and mercury—they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver. The *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: \"Yin within yang is called the Radiant Maiden; yang within yin is named the Golden Duke.\" These are the husband and wife within the crucible, the ladder to the Purple Palace. Those who awaken see immortality before their very eyes; those who remain deluded are separated by endless sands of dust.\n\nThe external true lead and true mercury are none other than the *qi* of the dragon and tiger at their first crescent. The internal true lead and true mercury are one’s own true *qi*, the golden elixir. Those of this age must recognize the authenticity of lead and mercury—these alone are real; all else is false. These two true substances can transform the corporeal into the incorporeal, becoming true immortals, for the lead and mercury of the mundane world cannot compare.\n\nNot knowing the inversion within the mysterious, how can one plant lotuses in fire? By human affairs, a man cannot conceive, nor can lotuses grow in fire. Yet the immortals possess the wondrous art of inversion, enabling a man to conceive, just as lotuses bloom in fire. Why? The *li* trigram is male, yet here it is female; the *kan* trigram is female, yet here it is male. This is the inversion. When these two are inverted, the elixir is born. Using the elixir to refine one’s own mercury into an infant is a man’s conception—is this not inversion? One who penetrates this principle plants lotuses in fire.\n\n\"Lead the White Tiger home to nurture,\nAnd bear a luminous pearl like the full moon.\"\n\nThe Green Dragon and White Tiger are both the essence of the true One, two things divided east and west, yet sharing the same origin under different names. The essence of the true One pertains to mercury; mercury is the dragon, dwelling in the east, so the essence of the true One resides in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of the true One, born in the west but with its home in the east. The Immortal Elder said: *\"The Golden Duke is a child of the eastern house, sent to the western neighbor to be born. Recognize and call him home to nurture, match him with the Radiant Maiden in kinship.\"*\n\nThus, leading the White Tiger home to pair with the Green Dragon as husband and wife, they produce a luminous pearl, round like the moon. The method of elixir refinement begins by taking the half-moon at the western upper crescent, obtaining eight ounces of yang metal. Next, take the half-moon at the eastern lower crescent, obtaining half a pound of yin water. Combining these two half-moons’ *qi* gives birth to the elixir, round like the full moon. The *Fire Record of the Great Elixir* states: *\"A single grain of numinous elixir, large as a millet seed, weighs one pound.\"* These two eight-ounce measures combine into one pound, echoing the Immortal Elder’s meaning of the full moon—both metaphors for the imagery of the external medicine.\n\nOnce this elixir is swallowed, the golden elixir becomes the White Tiger. Lead this White Tiger into your abdomen, pair it with your own mercury, then circulate the yin tally and yang fire through the sixty-four hexagrams, refining it into the golden liquid returning elixir. A single grain also weighs one pound, round like the moon—this is the imagery of the internal medicine.\n\nThe internal medicine’s roundness like the moon arises from the fire-circulation hexagrams: each hexagram has six lines, sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four lines, symbolizing one pound and three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The external medicine’s roundness like the moon comes from the two half-moons of the upper and lower crescents’ eightfold numbers. The *Kinship of the Three* states: *\"The upper crescent *dui* is eight, the lower crescent *gen* is also eight; when the two crescents merge their essence, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete. Two eights make one pound, the Dao of Change stands firm.\"* True One said: *\"The upper and lower crescents form the number of one pound. The three hundred eighty-four lines correspond to the fire phases—this is the calculation of lines.\"*\n\nThe Immortal Elder’s indication of the full moon’s meaning is to make scholars thoroughly understand the principles of creation, distinguishing the internal and external eightfold numbers—they cannot be discussed indiscriminately.\n\nDo not idly guard the elixir furnace to watch the fire phase;\nSimply settle the spirit and rest the breath, letting nature take its course.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir matures,\nLeaping from the mortal cage to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe fire is not the common fire of the world but the primordial ancestral *qi* of original yin and yang. There is no elixir furnace to guard—this is merely a metaphor. Qingxiazi said: *\"The crucible is no metal crucible, the furnace no medicinal furnace. Fire arises from below *li*, water responds within *kan*. When the three natures unite, the two flavors naturally converge. The embryo is sealed without leakage, transformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nGao Xiangxian said: *\"Heaven and earth bind the union of man and woman; the four images and five phases interlock. Day and night alternate in *zhun* and *meng* by natural law—why laboriously watch the fire phase?\"* This speaks of the natural furnace fire, not the furnace fire of the world. Simply settle the spirit and regulate the breath, harmonizing civil and martial, timing the tally and clepsydra—do not err by even a fraction, and within half an hour, the elixir will be attained. Then, follow the timing to advance and retreat the yin tally and yang fire, applying the techniques of drawing and adding, guarding against danger. After ten months of work, all yin is stripped away, the body transforms into pure yang, leaping from the mortal cage—how could this be merely ten thousand years?\n\nThis is merely a rough outline; only here is the golden liquid returning elixir achieved, yet it has not yet entered the wondrous. Further embrace the One for nine years, returning *qi* to its root, unifying form and spirit in wondrous harmony, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nTo know the source of the medicinal stream,\nIt lies only in the southwest—its native land.\nThe *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: *\"The medicine is born in the southwest, gathered in *wu* and *ji*; seize the moment, and the day to work arrives.\"*\n\nThe southwest is *kun*, the birthplace of the tiger. This direction is also where the moon rises, hence its native land. The moon is the crystal of metal and water; the upper and lower crescents’ metal and water merge *qi* to generate the medicine. The source of the medicinal material is the earth’s productive stream, truly issuing from the Mother *kun*.\n\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, hasten to gather;\nWhen metal meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit to taste.\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, the moon is full. When metal meets the full moon’s distance, the moon wanes. Seizing or missing the moment depends on oral transmission—it lies in heart-to-heart instruction.\n\nAn ancient poem says:\n*\"Count the breaths of the celestial cycle, tally each moment;\nThe jade clepsydra’s drips echo in perfect accord.\"*\nThis is the esoteric oral transmission passed from mouth to mouth.\n\nLu Sicheng, in his *Postface to the Awakening to Reality* as the Immortal Elder, noted that many who transmitted this poem misread *lead* as *if* and *metal* as *like*, gravely distorting the Immortal Elder’s profound intent. *Metal* and *lead* are none other than the Golden Elixir. On the *gui* day at the *zi* hour, one must work without delay—this is the moment to swiftly gather. If one waits until past the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste. This is the celestial mechanism, the oral transmission of the secret; it cannot be committed to writing. Master Lu revealed its threads to correct the errors of the foolish and ignorant. Yet he guarded its source, fearing its spread through written records. We who have received the mysterious instruction in person should understand it well. If not, it remains as unattainable as a pearl suspended five *zhang* above the earth—a millet-grain pearl not easily obtained.\n\nAlas, how many stray paths abound! Many mistake cinnabar for lead and gold, treating the gathering of *tian gui* as child’s play. Ye Wenshu’s talk of *kun* receiving *gui* is laughable. All these are the reckless fabrications of those who have never met a true master.\n\n*\"Return it to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly;\nNext, let the flowing pearl pair and match.\"*\n\nIngest the elixir into the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, firmly sealing the embryo to prevent leakage. Circulate the fire, let the flowing pearl enter the mercury, and pair it with the embryo to coalesce into the numinous.\n\n*\"The medicine weighs one *jin* and requires two eights;\nHarmonize the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\"*\n\nEight ounces of crow’s liver, half a *jin* of hare’s marrow—two eights together make one *jin*, hence the medicine’s weight. The fire is not fire in truth but borrows the qi of yin and yang, harmonizing and applying it to succeed.\n\n*\"Though ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures speak alike,\nThe Golden Elixir alone is the root and origin.\nFollow the *kun* position to form the body;\nPlant it in the *qian* household’s Chamber of Mutual Resonance.\"*\n\nDo not wonder that the celestial mechanism has been fully revealed—it is only that scholars remain deluded. If one can grasp the poem’s meaning, one stands among the Three Pure Ones as a Supreme Lord.\n\nThe ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures all converge on one truth: the qi of the waxing crescent (two eights) is the essence of the Elixir. Simply follow the generative principle of the Mother *kun* and cultivate it in reverse. After obtaining the Elixir, plant it in the Father *qian*’s Chamber of Mutual Resonance to circulate the fire of the tally. The wonder of elixir refinement lies in nothing but the two words *lead* and *fire*. The Immortal Elder has here disclosed the entire celestial mechanism, yet scholars remain stubbornly deluded. Why not seek it within oneself to illuminate the Supreme Way, coalescing into a single millet-grain and ascending as a guest of the Emperor?\n\n*\"In plants and trees, yin and yang are equally paired;\nIf one is lacking, they will not flourish.\nFirst, the green leaves open as yang takes the lead;\nLater, the red flowers bloom as yin follows.\"*\n\nThis is the constant Way of daily use, yet who knows the true source’s return to the root? I say to all gentlemen who study the Dao: if you do not understand yin and yang, do not scoff in ignorance.\n\nBefore plants and trees sprout, they contain the purest essence. When their husks split, they receive the primal qi to germinate, thus sending forth a single stem to symbolize that qi. Next, they divide into two leaves to symbolize yin and yang. Then, from between the two leaves, they send forth a bud to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, branches proliferate, flowers and leaves flourish—spring’s green leaves arise, summer’s red flowers bloom, all through the agency of yang qi. Autumn’s solemnity yields fruit, winter’s desolation returns them to mulch, all through the agency of yin qi. When yin and yang are equally paired, transformation is ceaseless; if one is lacking, the myriad things cannot arise.\n\nMaster True Unity said: *\"Solitary yin does not grow on its own; solitary yang does not achieve completion.\"* Thus, heaven and earth embrace, and the myriad things transform into purity. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are born. The common people take this as their daily constant Way, unaware of the wondrous principle of the true source—the mechanism of reversing yin and yang, their inverted mutual use—to transcend life and death. If scholars do not understand this and mock me, they merely reveal their own blindness.\n\n*\"Three, five, one—just these three words;\nFrom ancient times to now, those who truly understand are rare.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five;\nNorth’s one and west’s four share the same.\"*\n\nThree, five, and one are none other than the dragon and tiger. The dragon pertains to wood, wood’s number is three, and it resides in the east. Wood generates fire, so the dragon’s crescent qi is fire. Fire’s number is two, and it resides in the south. The two things share a source, so three and two combine to form five. The tiger pertains to metal, metal’s number is four, and it resides in the west. Metal generates water, so the tiger’s child qi pertains to water. Water’s number is one, and it resides in the north. The two things share an office, so four and one combine to form five. The two fives meet in the central palace of *wu* and *ji*, which pertains to earth, earth’s number is five, forming the three fives. The three fives combine to generate the Elixir, and the Elixir is one. These three words—from ancient times to the present—are understood by few. Those who do comprehend them coalesce the infant, a truly rare achievement.\n\n*\"The infant is one containing true qi;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.\"*\n\nOne is the Elixir, and the Elixir is the infant. One is the true qi of Unity, the mother of heaven and earth. My true Unity is the child of heaven and earth. Drawing in the mother qi to return to the five viscera, it subdues the child qi—like a cat seizing a mouse to prevent its escape. Thus, the qi of mother and child entwine within the embryo to coalesce the infant of Unity, hence the term *Great Unity containing the true*. Containing the true qi of Unity is like a woman carrying a child: after ten months, the gestation is complete, and the sacred embryo is naturally born. Likewise, after ten months of work, the elixir is perfected, and one naturally becomes spiritually sagely—hence the saying, *\"After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.\"*\n\nDo not take solitary yin for possessing yang—cultivating but a single element only leads to emaciation and decline.\nStraining the body with presses and stretches is not the Way; refining qi and ingesting mist are all madness.\n\nWithin yang lies yin essence—this is one’s true essence, and it is One.\nEssence generates qi, qi generates spirit; the nourishment and defense of the whole body originate from this.\nWhen the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out; when the marrow is depleted, the body perishes.\nThis speaks of essence and qi as the very root of the body. Yet how can this substance, which belongs to yin—like cinnabar containing mercury, or fire born within wood—be controlled? Its nature is to flee, easily lost and difficult to capture, refusing to be refined. Without the primal yang elixir of Great Unity to subdue it, there is no way to congeal it into transformation. If one cultivates only this single element, one only grows weaker. Moreover, straining the body with presses and stretches is not the true Way, and those who ingest mist and refine qi are but madmen.\n\nEven if one were to absorb the essence of sun and moon, illuminating the five viscera; circulate the twin passes along the spine to replenish the brain and return essence; achieve liberation from the corpse or enter deep meditation—though there be a thousand methods and ten thousand techniques, they all amount to cultivating but a single element. Solitary yin without yang is like a sparrow or hen brooding an egg: can it ever hatch a chick?\n\nMaster Zhongli said:\nTears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humor—these seven are all yin.\nIf one takes such things as the substance of the elixir, how can one’s spirit ascend to the Jade Capital?\n\nWithin the body, not only is true essence a yin substance—all five viscera and six bowels are yin, not yang. If this is so, can one truly divide heart and kidney into Kan and Li, or take liver and lung as dragon and tiger? Can one use spirit and qi as mother and child, or cling to fluids as mercury and lead? If one clings to such methods in seeking the proof of pure yang, it is like adding ice to cold or hot water to heat—like making turtles fly and snakes dance, only growing more perverse.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\nPlace two women in the same chamber, their beauty most fair; send Su Qin to mediate and Zhang Yi to broker, their eloquence unbounded, their words most persuasive. Though they pour out their hearts to harmonize, seeking to unite as husband and wife, their hair will rot and their teeth decay before they ever know one another.\nTo wed a woman to a woman, to refine yin with yin—why then bind and strangle? How can transformation and life arise?\n\nThe world seeks in vain to subdue mercury and lead—when will they ever see dragon and tiger descend?\nI urge you to exhaustively seek the source of your birth, to return to the root and revert to the origin—this is the King of Medicines.\n\nThe true tiger and true dragon are the two eights.\nThe true lead and true mercury are the qi of the two phases.\nThis Way is most simple, most near, most immediate—yet scholars cling to perverse interpretations, stubbornly recognizing only side doors. They do not know their own kind, vainly seeking mercury and lead. How could they know that the immortal elders directly point to the very source of mercury and lead, the riverhead from which they spring? Exhaust the root of your body—whence you came, where life is established—and in reversing this, returning to the source, the true dragon and true tiger will descend of themselves, the true lead and true mercury will be subdued of themselves. Who but the King of Medicines could achieve this?\n\nIn recent times, some have likened the minor elixir of Primordial Unity to the golden elixir—like grasping at the moon by climbing bamboo, is this not far from the mark? All that is born after heaven and earth, possessing form and substance, is not the supreme medicine. For that which lies below form is not the Way of the primordial.\n\nNot recognizing true lead as the true ancestor, all efforts are wasted.\nThe essence of true lead lies in the two eights—all else is not the true Way. Since it is not the true Way, all effort is in vain.\n\nSevering ties with one’s wife, vainly separating yin and yang—\n*The Song of Breaking Delusion* from Yimen says:\nSolitary yin is not the Way; yin and yang lose their proper places.\n\nMaster Wang said:\nThe student stubbornly rejects wife and concubine, not understanding the effortless and the all-pervading.\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nSome dwell in solitary yang, some in lone yin.\nThis speaks of partial yin or partial yang, of cultivating but a single element, of clinging to bedroom arts and the control of women—slandering the immortal Way, leading one far astray.\n\nFasting only leaves the intestines empty—\n*The Song of Breaking Delusion* says:\nSevering the root is not the Way; the dead become hungry ghosts.\nTruly, these are words of truth.\n\nHerbs, trees, gold, and silver are all coarse substances; mist, clouds, sun, and moon belong to the realm of obscurity.\n\nEven with breathwork and visualization added,\nAll remain far from the work of the Golden Elixir.\n\nThis song speaks of the postcelestial, earth-born, coarse substances—\neasy to encounter, hard to perfect.\nHow could they be mentioned in the same breath as the Golden Elixir?\n\nA five-line verse to mirror the singularity of the Great One:\n\nThe maiden dons robes of blue,\nThe young lord wraps himself in white silk.\nThe maiden dons robes of blue—\nthe maiden is the yang’s latent yin, the dragon’s string-qi,\nyang within yin, thus called “maiden,” also named “Wood Consort.”\nBorn of the Azure Dragon, she wears blue.\n\nThe young lord is the yin’s latent yang, the tiger’s string-qi,\nyin within yang, thus called “Golden Lord.”\nBorn of the White Tiger, he wraps himself in white silk.\n\nTo see is not to use; to use is not to see.\nWhat has form and can be seen belongs to the postcelestial, earth-born, coarse substances.\nBecause it has form, it can be seen but not used.\nWhat has no form to observe is the first and second string-qi of the primal.\nThough unseen, it can be used.\n\nIn the dim and indistinct, they meet;\nWithin the profound and obscure, transformation occurs.\nThe dim and indistinct, the profound and obscure—\nthis is the qi of the Primal Unity, born before heaven and earth, beyond measure.\nWithin the dim lies a thing: the dragon’s first string-qi.\nWithin the obscure resides an essence: the tiger’s first string-qi.\nAs the two string-qi dwell in the dim and the obscure—\nthe essence is the tiger’s string-qi,\nthe thing is the dragon’s string-qi.\nBound within the dim and obscure, compressed and refined,\nthe true unity stirs and manifests change—\nthis is the formless giving birth to form.\n\nIn a flash, a flame takes flight,\nAnd the True One emerges of itself.\nThe True One is the Golden Elixir.\nThe sage condenses a year’s qi-markers into a single hour,\nthen divides that hour into six intervals.\nWithin just two intervals, applying the fire of refinement,\nthe essence of the true unity is immediately obtained,\ncoalescing into a single grain of millet,\nmanifest in the Northern Sea—\nis this not the True One emerging in a flash of fire?\n\nThis Way is most wondrous.\nWithout the oral transmission of an immortal master,\nwho could attain this?\n\nThe Immortal Elder thus declares:\nThough a single grain of the Golden Elixir arises from the qi of the Great Ultimate,\nwithout the union of the two string-qi, the Elixir cannot form.\nThe Elixir is earth.\nDragon and tiger, together with the two string-qi, complete the Four Images.\nThe Four Images converge in the Central Palace to become the Five Phases.\nThe Supreme Song says:\n“The Five Phases are but the medicine;\nthe Four Images must not be transgressed.”\nThus, the harmony of Five Phases and Four Images gives birth to the Elixir.\n\nThese five lines and four rhymes conceal the marvel of the Great One’s primal qi.\n\n*Commentary on the Awakening to Reality, Volume One* concludes.\n*Commentary on the Awakening to Reality, Volume Two* begins.\n\nXiangchuan’s Anonymous Master Weng Yuanming annotates:\n\nThe Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-being gives rise to the primal qi;\nthis primal qi divides into yin and yang.\nThus, the qi of utmost yang—light and pure—floats upward to become heaven;\nthe qi of utmost yin—heavy and turbid—sinks downward to become earth.\nThe accumulation of pure yang qi that ascends to heaven is the immortal;\nthe accumulation of pure yin qi that descends into earth is the ghost.\nEndowed with the qi of one yin and one yang, a body neither ascends nor sinks,\ndwelling between heaven and earth, may become either immortal or ghost.\nTherefore, if one knows the art of cultivation,\nstripping away all yin to transform the form into pure yang qi, one ascends as an immortal.\nIf one knows not cultivation,\ndaily depleting the original yang to transform the body into pure yin qi, one descends as a ghost.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward;\nthat which is rooted in earth inclines downward.”\nEach follows its kind.\nThus, the sage, observing above and examining below,\nknows that humans, endowed with the finest essence of heaven and earth,\nare the most spiritually noble.\nTherefore, they borrow the true yin and true yang,\nseizing the primal qi prior to heaven and earth to forge the Elixir,\nwhich they ingest into the qi-sea of the Cinnabar Field,\nthereby governing the postnatal qi of the body’s heaven and earth.\nThus, the body’s myriad phenomena naturally return to it,\nas the myriad states pay homage to the sovereign,\nor the stars encircle the North Star.\nKnowing that humans owe their existence to the union of father and mother,\nthey steal the pure essence of yin and yang as the foundation for transformation,\ncalling it the \"yin tally\" and \"yang fire.\"\nCircling through the sixty-four hexagrams,\nrevolving endlessly,\nthey cycle the seventy-two seasonal nodes and twenty-four qi within a single day and night,\nseizing the upright qi of four thousand three hundred and twenty years,\nconverging it within the qi-sea of the Cinnabar Field.\nThey nurture the \"child pearl,\"\nwhich abides in the Central Palace, wu-wei, governing externally.\nThus, externally, it harmonizes the yin-yang tally and fire,\nwhile internally, it generates the true unity of the spirit-body.\nAfter ten months of gestation,\nthe form transforms into pure yang non-being,\nhunger and thirst cannot disturb it,\ncold and heat cannot invade it.\n\nThe method for enriching the state and pacifying the people:\nthe state is an analogy for the body;\nthe people are the essence-qi.\nThe people are the foundation of the state;\nwhen the foundation is firm, the state is at peace.\nIf the state lacks a ruler, to whom shall the people turn?\nIf the ruler lacks ministers, how can the state be governed?\nThus, the sage makes the Elixir the ruler and fire the minister.\nWhen Elixir and fire depend on each other,\nruler and minister rejoice in harmony,\nand the world is well-ordered.\nWhen the essence-people are at peace,\nthe state of the body is enriched.\nThe *Western Florescence Scripture* says:\n“When essence is complete and qi is full, this is enriching the state and pacifying the people.”\nThis occurs after ingesting the Golden Elixir.\nThus, the Immortal Elder appends sixty-four quatrains to dispel delusion,\narranging them according to the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*,\nto clarify the reckoning of the fire-phase.\nHe further adds twelve *Moon Over the West River* lyrics,\nsymbolizing the twelve months of the \"bathing\" practice.\nThis is why I divide this into the middle volume,\nto elucidate the intent of enriching the state and pacifying the people through the fire-phase.\nSuch is the proper sequence in the practice of Elixir cultivation.\n\n**Sixty-Four Quatrains**\n\nThe radiant Golden Elixir forms in a single day—\nthe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three,\nit is merely procrastination, delaying the schedule.\n\nThe Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir,\nwith effort no more than half an hour,\nyields the Golden Elixir for ingestion.\nThis \"single day\" means the sage condenses a year’s qi-nodes into a month,\nthen condenses a month’s qi-nodes into a day,\nand further condenses a day’s work into an hour.\nGenerally speaking, this is called \"a single day.\"\nThe Immortal Elder says:\n“Exchanging hours for days initiates the divine work.”\nOnce the Golden Elixir enters the mouth,\none immediately ascends to the sacred realm.\nThe analogy clarifies how swift the verification is—\nhow could it take three years or nine,\nprolonging time and delaying the schedule?\n\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nthen gather the crow and hare as medicine for refinement.\nOnce these two are guided into the Yellow Path,\nhow could the numinous Elixir fail to be born?\n\nAn ancient song says:\n“The sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun;\nhow could the myriad images and all phenomena not be illuminated?”\nThe sage uses Qian and Kun as an analogy for the crucible and vessel,\nand the sun and moon as an analogy for the medicine.\nMoreover, Qian and Kun are the true dragon and true tiger,\nwhile the medicine is the string-qi of dragon and tiger.\nMaster Wei says:\n“The crucible is fundamentally without crucible;\nthe medicine is fundamentally without medicine.”\nThe sage borrows names and adopts analogies in this manner.\nThe essential point lies solely in the initial string-qi of the true dragon and true tiger,\ntheir union and refinement,\nso that the essence of true unity congeals within the Central Palace of the Northern Sea.\nThus, the Immortal Elder says:\n“Once these two are guided into the Yellow Path,\nhow could the numinous Elixir fail to be born?”\nThe Yellow Path is the place of congealment in the Central Palace.\n\nTake the solid center of the Kan position,\nto transmute the inner yin of the Li palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nwhere hidden flight and leaping are all at the heart’s command.\n\nThe Li trigram has outer yang and inner yin;\nthe Kan trigram has outer yin and inner yang.\nUsing outer yang to transmute inner yin forms the Qian trigram.\nThe Metal Mother is the qi of utmost yang,\ncalled the Yang Elixir,\ncongealed in the Central Palace of the Northern Sea.\nTaking it to transmute one’s own yin mercury\ntransforms it into a body of pure yang.\nThereafter, in firing,\nwithdrawing and adding, advancing and retreating,\nall are at the command of my heart’s operation.\nSome mistakenly take the cinnabar of the roundel as the single line in Kan,\nbut this is as distant as clouds and mud from the Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir.\nThey do not realize it is a postnatal, impure substance,\nnot the primal qi of the prior heaven.\n\nIf Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji,\nthough they contain the Four Images, the Elixir cannot form.\nOnly because each holds the true earth,\ndoes the Golden Elixir achieve reversal and return.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n“Li’s Ji is the sun’s light;\nKan’s Wu is the moon’s essence.”\n\nLi’s Ji resembles the yang qi of the dragon’s bowstring;\nKan’s Wu resembles the yin qi of the tiger’s bowstring.\nWu and Ji are one body of earth,\nyet divided between the two forms of dragon and tiger—\nthus each holds true earth within.\nIf dragon and tiger lacked the qi of earth,\nhow could they merge and draw the Four Images into true earth to form the Elixir?\nOnly because each contains the qi of earth\ndo dragon and tiger unite, Wu and Ji conjoin,\nthe Four Images gather, and the Elixir is achieved—\nhence the Way of reversal and return.\n\nThe sun dwells in Li’s position yet becomes female;\nKan pairs with the Toad Palace yet is male.\nFailing to grasp this principle of inversion,\ndo not presume to discourse on such lofty matters with mere personal views.\nThe crow within the sun belongs to yin, thus Li is called female.\nThe hare within the moon belongs to yang, thus Kan is called male.\nTo speak without understanding this\nis like gazing at the heavens through a tube—\nhow narrow is one’s vision!\n\nThe mercury of the Thunder Dragon emerges from the Land of Li;\nthe lead of the Lake Tiger is born in the region of Kan.\nThese two substances arise as children producing their mothers,\nand the Five Phases must all enter the Central Palace.\nMercury, the Thunder Dragon, pertains to wood—\nwood generates fire, so wood is the mother of fire, fire the child of wood:\nthis is the ordinary sequence of the common Dao.\nYet when cinnabar, belonging to fire, resides in Li,\nmercury is born from within the cinnabar—\nfire, contrary to the norm, generates wood,\nhence the saying “the child produces the mother.”\nThe Perfected One of Great White Mountain sings:\n*“The Five Phases’ inverted art—\nthe dragon emerges from within the fire.”*\nLead, the Lake Tiger, pertains to metal—\nmetal generates water, so metal is the mother of water, water the child of metal:\nthis is the ordinary sequence of the common Dao.\nYet when black lead, belonging to water, resides in Kan,\nsilver is born from within the lead—\nwater, contrary to the norm, generates metal,\nhence the saying “the child produces the mother.”\nAnother song declares:\n*“The Five Phases do not proceed in order—\nthe tiger is born within the water.”*\nThe Immortal Elder speaks of lead being born in Kan,\nnot silver, because the silver within lead is called true lead,\nalso known as silver within water—\nthus he refers to true lead, speaking of lead rather than silver.\nThese two substances mutually generate one another,\nforming the Four Images,\nwhich gather in the Central Palace to complete the Five Phases—\nthe Five Phases unite, and the Golden Elixir congeals.\nThus it is said: *“The Five Phases must all enter the Central Palace.”*\n\nThe hexagrams establish images to represent forms;\ngrasp the image, forget the words, and the meaning becomes clear.\nLater generations of deluded disciples cling to these images,\npracticing hexagram qi in hopes of ascension.\nThe hexagrams are but the trap and snare of the firing process.\nWhen Master Wei studied the *Book of Changes*,\nhe awakened to the fact that the workings of the Golden Elixir\nare identical to those of the *Changes*—\nthus he composed the *Cantong Qi*,\nelaborating the images of the *Changes* to illuminate the Great Elixir,\noffering guidance to later generations.\nHe compared Qian and Kun to the crucible and furnace,\nsymbolizing the numinous womb within the self’s belly.\nHe took Kan and Li as the medicinal substances,\nsymbolizing the lead and mercury within the numinous womb.\nQian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams;\nKan and Li are the true essences of the parents—\nthus these four hexagrams reside in the Central Palace,\njust as the numinous womb’s lead and mercury dwell in the Cinnabar Field.\nAbiding in the center to govern the exterior,\nthese four hexagrams are not bound by the revolving hub’s reckoning.\nThe remaining hexagrams are distributed throughout a single month,\nadvancing the firing times in sequence—\nbeginning with *Tun* and *Meng*,\nending with *Ji Ji*,\nrevolving without cease, like a wheel’s unending motion.\nEach day governs two hexagrams,\nthree days accounting for six hexagrams—\ntogether with the four hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li,\nthe total is sixty-four hexagrams,\ncomprising three hundred sixty-four lines,\nsymbolizing a year’s three hundred eighty-four days, including the intercalary remainder.\nThey also represent the two times eight ounces of the Golden Elixir,\ntotaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*.\nAll are metaphors and established images.\nThus, the adept who studies these hexagrams\nmay awaken to the firing’s workings.\nOnce the firing times are understood,\nthe hexagrams may all be forgotten as useless.\nYet today’s students, deluded by this,\npractice hexagram qi,\nwearying their bodies and tormenting their minds in hopes of ascension—\nis this not lamentable?\n*“Catch the fish, forget the trap;\ncatch the hare, forget the snare.”*\nNow they cling to the trap and snare as if they were the fish and hare—\nhow far they have strayed from the Dao!\n\nSwallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,\nyet only with substance can transformation and generation occur.\nIf the crucible lacks a true seed,\nit is like boiling an empty cauldron with fierce fire.\nThe so-called practices of swallowing saliva and absorbing qi\nare all postnatal substances born of heaven and earth—\nnot true qi absorption.\nTrue qi absorption first subdues and then absorbs.\n*“Subdue qi without absorbing it;\nabsorb only after subduing qi.\nAbsorbing qi does not grant long life—\nlong life requires subduing qi.”*\nThe qi of the True One\ndwells in the unfathomable, the indistinct—\ndifficult to seek, difficult to perceive.\nThe sage subdues it with method,\nthus within the unfathomable there is substance,\nwithin the indistinct there is essence.\nRefining this essence and substance into the Elixir,\nabsorbing it into the Cinnabar Field,\nthen the myriad transformations arise.\nThus it is said: *“Only with substance can transformation and generation occur”*—\nthis substance is the true seed.\nWithout this true seed,\nall efforts are labor in vain,\nlike boiling an empty cauldron with great fire—\nbefore long, all will be ruined.\n\nOn the peaks of Mount Hua, the male tiger roars;\nin the depths of Fusang’s sea, the female dragon hums.\nThe Yellow Dame herself knows how to act as matchmaker,\nsending them to become husband and wife with a single heart.\nMount Hua is the western mountain’s image—\nthe tiger.\nThe male tiger is the yang qi of the tiger,\nyin within yang—\nthus it is called the male tiger.\nFusang is where the sun rises from the sea,\nsymbolizing the dragon.\nThe female dragon is the yin qi of the dragon,\nyang within yin—\nthus it is called the female dragon.\nThese two are separated,\ndwelling in the east and west.\nThe matchmaker, the Yellow Dame,\nenables their union as husband and wife,\njoining as one heart to produce the yellow sprout.\n\nHarmonizing lead and mercury to form the Elixir,\nneither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.\nDrive the dragon, and fire-mercury soars;\nride the tiger, and water-lead glitters.\n\nBinding the warp of creation to establish it,\nthe primordial harmonious qi coalesces—\nwhat harm could there be?\nThus, neither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.\n\nThe dragon is great, the tiger small—\nthis is the principle of yang’s honor and yin’s humility.\nIf one asks what true lead is,\nthe toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.\nThe Golden Elixir arises from the union of upper and lower crescents,\ngold and water conjoined—\nthis is called true lead.\nThe toad’s radiance is the essence of metal-water,\nbelonging to yin.\n\"Shines\" signifies its exchange of light with the sun,\nsymbolizing the Dao of yin-yang union.\nThe west is the direction of metal,\nprecisely aligned with the central qi of the eighth month.\n\"River\" is water.\nOn the fifteenth day of the eighth month,\nthe sages sense the fusion of metal and water qi,\ngiving rise to the essence of the true One—\nhence, \"the toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.\"\n\nIf one does not recognize the yang essence and the roles of host and guest,\nhow can one know which is distant and which is near?\nIn the chamber, sealing the Gate of Tail and Yin Orifice,\nhow many in Jambudvīpa have been led to ruin?\nZhongli said:\nThe four great elements of the body all belong to yin—\nwhat then is the yang essence?\nThis essence is the qi of the true One,\nthe most yang of substances—\nit is called the Yang Elixir.\nThe true within one’s own body belongs to yin,\nserving as the master of the body to nurture its entirety.\nThe Yang Elixir comes from without,\nsubduing one’s own yin mercury—\nthus, the Elixir becomes the host,\nwhile one’s own mercury becomes the guest.\nWhen the two long for each other,\nthey congeal into golden cinnabar,\nnaturally immovable.\nThen, with the addition of fire,\nthey are refined into the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir.\nThus, the Yang Elixir outside is called distant,\nwhile one’s own true qi within is called near.\nReversing this near and far to establish host and guest—\nthis is how the Dao is accomplished.\nDeluded disciples fail to grasp this principle,\ninstead practicing the arts of bedchamber retention,\nforcibly sealing their essence and qi,\ncalling it \"refining the Yin Elixir,\"\nseeking to prolong life—\nas if using kindling to extinguish fire.\nThe scripture says:\nFire arises from wood,\ndisaster follows swiftly.\nThe harm done is grave—\ncan one not be cautious?\n\nUse lead, but not common lead;\nonce true lead is used, it is then discarded.\nThis is the true esoteric formula for using lead—\n\"Use lead, do not use it\" is no empty word.\nCommon lead is of the postnatal, impure substance.\nTrue lead is the qi of the true One.\nA person’s essence and qi scatter daily,\nunable to congeal and form the sacred embryo.\nThus, the sages refine true lead to subdue them,\ncausing them to congeal into cinnabar.\nDay by day, fire is applied,\ngradually adding mercury.\nAs mercury qi increases,\nlead qi diminishes.\nAdding mercury, reducing lead—\nsuch is the marvel.\nAfter ten months, the fire is complete,\nthe six hundred hexagrams conclude,\nlead qi ascends and floats away,\nlike dust in a bright window,\nscattering in fragments.\nAfter nine years of embracing the One,\nlead qi is entirely dispersed,\nleaving only pure dry mercury.\nWhen lead is exhausted and mercury desiccated,\nthey transform into the Great Returned Elixir of Golden Liquid.\nThe body becomes purely yang,\nits lifespan equal to heaven’s—\nthus, \"once true lead is used, it is then discarded.\"\nThe phrase \"use lead, do not use it\"—\nhow could it be mere fabrication?\nHearing the Dao to this point,\none should enlighten the mind before heaven, saying:\n\"The teacher’s grace is hard to repay.\nI vow to accomplish the Dao to requite the teacher’s kindness.\nTo betray the teacher is to betray heaven.\"\n\nWhen bamboo is broken, it is fitting to mend it with bamboo;\nwhen a chick is overturned, it must be righted with an egg.\nAll other methods are labor in vain—\nhow can they compare to true lead uniting with the sacred mechanism?\nIf a bamboo vessel breaks, can it be mended with metal or wood?\nIt must be mended with bamboo—\nonly then is the vessel whole.\nIf a chick is overturned, can it be warmed with earth or stone?\nIt must be righted with an egg—\nonly then will it hatch and live.\nMaster Tao said:\n\"When bamboo is severed, mend it with bamboo;\nwhen wood is split, repair it with wood.\nA leaking roof is covered with tiles;\na declining person is sustained by their kind.\"\nIn cultivating the Dao, without the qi of the same kind,\nall effort is wasted labor.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n\"With the same kind, effort is easily applied;\nwith different kinds, skill is hard to achieve.\nTo become an immortal through ingestion,\none must use that which is of the same kind.\"\nHumans receive the finest qi of heaven and earth to come into being.\nTrue lead is the mother qi of heaven and earth,\nconceived through a vessel of the same kind—\nthus, true lead is the mother qi,\nwhile one’s own essence and qi are the child qi.\nIs this not the ultimate marvel of the same kind?\nHow can one attain this?\nIt is the profound mechanism of the sages,\nthe essential Dao of spontaneity.\n\nMedicine meets its kindred qi and forms an image;\nthe Dao unites with the subtle and formless, becoming natural.\nSwallowing a single grain of the Golden Elixir,\none then knows that my fate is not ruled by heaven.\n\nThere is a thing formless yet complete,\nborn before heaven and earth.\nThe sages forcibly named it the qi of the Primordial True One.\nInvisible when seen,\ninaudible when heard,\nintangible when grasped.\nThe sages, through the qi of the two eights’ initial crescent,\nsensed and communicated with it,\ndescending in spirit to form an image.\nWithin the empty mystery,\na grain like millet—\ntaking and ingesting it,\none’s own mercury is instantly dried,\ntransforming into a purely yang body,\nits years equal to heaven and earth.\nMaster Chaoyuan said:\n\"Life and death are entirely governed by heaven and earth,\nyet destiny originally belongs to mercury and lead.\"\nIs this not \"my fate lies within me, not in heaven\"?\n\nThe Dao arises from emptiness and generates the One qi,\nfrom the One qi, yin and yang are produced.\nYin and yang unite to give birth to the Three Bodies,\nthe Three Bodies give rise to the myriad things.\nThe Dao is fundamentally empty, yet gives form to the real.\nThe Dao is fundamentally nonexistent, yet gives shape to existence.\nOnce shaped, life begins—\none gives birth to two,\ntwo gives birth to three,\nthree gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe myriad things all bear yin and embrace yang,\nharmonizing through the primordial qi.\nBefore their form appears,\nthe primordial harmonious qi is invisible.\nOnce formed,\nthe light and clear qi becomes yang,\nthe heavy and turbid qi becomes yin—\nthus, yang heaven is the father,\nyin earth is the mother.\nThe two qi intertwine,\ntheir natures harmonizing,\nuniting to form the Three Bodies—\nthese are the Three Powers:\nheaven, earth, and humanity.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states:\n\"Heaven and earth intertwine, and the myriad things transform into purity.\nMale and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are born through transformation.\"\nThe sage delves into these profound mysteries to know their source,\nexhausts their divine workings to understand their transformations.\nThus, he can return to the root and restore the origin,\ninverting and refining, reversing the workings of creation.\nHe plunders the mother qi of heaven and earth to forge the elixir,\nsteals the essence of yin and yang as the fire of non-action,\nrefines the form to return to the One Radiance,\nrefines the Radiance to revert to emptiness and nothingness.\nThus, body and Dao unite,\nsubtle and wondrously interconnected,\nendlessly transforming,\nhidden and manifest beyond measure—\nthis is called the Perfected Person.\n\nA single flavor from Snow Mountain, fine as ghee,\npoured into the crucible of Eastern Yang’s creation.\nSnow Mountain, white in color, symbolizes the west—\nthis is the Golden Elixir.\nA single grain of the Golden Elixir,\ntastes like ghee.\nTake and ingest it,\nenter the crucible within my cinnabar field,\nrefining it into the sacred embryo.\n\n\"Should one pass beyond Kunlun to the northwest,\nZhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.\"\nKunlun Mountain lies amid the sea,\nand the Kunlun of my body also rests within the lower watery sea,\nits form resembling Kunlun Mountain—\nthe true place where fire is kindled.\nKunlun Mountain has a gate,\ncalled the Mysterious Gate,\nwhich is the Gate of Heaven.\nThe Gate of Heaven lies in the northwest, the position of Qian.\nThe immortal elder says: \"Planted in the Qian household’s chamber of union.\"\nThus, traveling northwest,\nZhang Qian meets Ma Gu.\nZhang Qian symbolizes the Qian trigram,\nembodying yang fire,\nand also represents true mercury.\nMa Gu symbolizes the Kun trigram,\nembodying the yin tally,\nand also represents true lead.\nThis speaks of passing beyond Kunlun to kindle the fire,\nentering through the Mysterious Gate—\nthen within the crucible, true lead first meets true mercury,\nand transformation begins.\nWhen the true embryo melts within,\ntrue fire connects without,\nKun’s tally joins Qian’s tally,\nyin water pursues the yang tally,\nthe two fires intermingle,\nlead and mercury unite—\nthe root of the immortals’ Dao lies herein.\n\nZhang Qian’s ride on the raft,\narriving at the lunar palace to meet the Woman Star,\nis but a metaphor for the union of yin and yang.\n\nThe Maiden wanders with purpose,\nher forward steps short, her backward steps long.\nThe Maiden is mercury,\nsaid to wander with the fire in a fixed pattern.\nThe forward step is the work of the outer medicine,\nthe backward step is the work of the inner medicine.\nWith these two movements,\nher wandering follows its own course.\nWhen the sage first begins the work of refining the elixir,\nhe moves the mercury fire for no more than half an hour,\nimmediately obtaining the essence of the True One to ingest—\nthus, the forward step must be short.\nAfter consuming the elixir,\nhe moves his own mercury fire,\nrequiring ten months of work—\nthus, the backward step is long.\n\nReturning, he enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,\nmarrying the Metal Lord to become the Old Gentleman.\nThe Yellow Dame’s inner symbol\nis the golden womb, the earthen crucible.\nThe Metal Lord is true lead,\nthe Old Gentleman symbolizes pure yang.\nTrue mercury, through the external movement of fire,\nflies into the chamber of spirit,\nuniting with true lead in mutual embrace,\ntransforming into a body of pure yang—\nthus, she marries the Metal Lord to become the Old Gentleman.\n\"Returning\" signifies the completion of the work.\n\nIn use, one must divide the left and right armies—\nlet them take the lead while I remain the guest.\n\nAdvise you, when facing the battlefront, not to underestimate the foe—\nlest you lose our priceless treasure of the house.\nThis clarifies the workings of fire and timing.\nThe \"general\" is fire.\nThe left is civil, the right is martial.\nThe sage condenses a year’s fire-timing into a single month,\na month’s timing into a single day.\nFrom *zi* to *si*, the six hours belong to yang,\nsymbolizing the virtue of spring and summer’s growth—\nthus civil fire resides on the left, called \"yang fire.\"\nFrom *wu* to *hai*, the six hours belong to yin,\nsymbolizing the punishment of autumn and winter’s withering—\nthus martial fire resides on the right, called \"yin tally.\"\n\"Let them take the lead while I remain the guest\" means\nholding to the feminine without clinging to the masculine,\nmaintaining stillness without contention.\nThe host is yang and masculine, fond of strife;\nthe guest is yin and feminine, fond of quiet.\nThis expresses caution against peril, reverence for danger.\nThe art of war says: \"Wait at ease for the weary,\"\nand again: \"Control others without being controlled\"—\nthis is the meaning.\nThe application of the Dao lies in fire,\nthe use of fire lies in the practitioner—\nlike a guest before the host,\nadvancing and retreating with reverence,\ndaring not act recklessly.\nThose who work with fire must not fail to understand this.\n\nIn applying fire, first set the water clock to divide *zi* and *wu*.\nNext, connect yin and yang to establish the foundation of transformation.\nDeploy the sixty-four hexagrams within the yin tally,\nstrike the twenty-four qi with yang fire.\nThe celestial gate is in hand,\nthe earthly axis stored in the heart.\nGather the seventy-two seasonal nodes at the crucial ford,\nconcentrate them within the crucible.\nSeize the three thousand six hundred breaths of true qi,\nconverge them within the embryo.\nWith methodical application, orderly withdrawal and addition,\nmovement guarded against peril—\ndare not err by even a hair’s breadth.\nThus, externally, one joins the tally of yin and yang;\ninternally, the body of True Unity is born.\nIf, however, the mind is not reverent,\nthe timing and measures deviate,\ncausing the Maiden to flee,\nthe numinous embryo within the crucible to fail,\nand the priceless treasure of the Returned Elixir to be lost.\nNow, facing the battlefront,\nhow could one not hold to the feminine and underestimate the foe?\n\nThe White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly,\nthe Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.\nSeize them with both hands and force them to fight to the death—\nthey transform into a lump of purple-gold frost.\nThis speaks of external imagery,\nalready explained in the third poem of the previous four stanzas.\nThe purple-gold frost is the Golden Elixir.\nMaster Haichan said:\n\"With the left hand seize the Azure Dragon’s head,\nwith the right drag the White Tiger’s tail—\nswallow them both at once,\nand find the taste most sweet.\nCount it as gold within water,\nonly then does one grasp the profound mystery of the subtle truth.\"\nThis is the proof.\nTo take both hands as two beasts is mistaken.\n\nAfter the first quarter and before the last,\nthe medicinal flavor is balanced, the qi-image complete.\nGather it and return to the furnace for forging—\nrefined through nurturing, self-boiling and steaming.\nWhen the moon reaches its thirtieth day,\nthe yang soul is utterly spent,\nthe yin essence’s water fills the wheel—\nthus it is pure black and without light,\nsymbolizing the *Kun* hexagram, called \"darkness.\"\nAt this time, it meets the sun in the two days of darkness and new moon,\nmoving in union, acting as one.\nBy the second day, touched by the sun’s light, it conceives,\ngradually parting.\nBy the third day at sunset,\na crescent appears above *geng*—\nwithin the pure yin wheel, one yang light is born,\nthe soul within the essence arises,\nsymbolizing the *Zhen* hexagram.\nAt this moment, the yang soul’s gold is newly born,\nthe medicinal sprout fresh.\nBy the eighth day, two yangs arise,\nsymbolizing the *Dui* hexagram.\nAt this time, the soul within the essence is half—\nlevel as a cord, called the \"first quarter.\"\nBefore this quarter belongs to yang, after it to yin—\nyin within yang half,\nyielding eight ounces of gold within water,\nits flavor balanced, its qi-image complete.\n\nBy the fifteenth day, three yangs are complete,\nsymbolizing the *Qian* hexagram.\nAt this time, the yin essence’s water is exhausted,\nthe yang soul’s gold fills the wheel—\nthus it is full, pure yang without yin,\ncalled the \"full moon.\"\nYang at its peak gives birth to yin—\nthus on the sixteenth day, within the pure yang wheel, one yin arises,\nthe essence within the soul is born,\nsymbolizing the *Xun* hexagram.\nGradually waning to the twenty-third day, two yins arise,\nsymbolizing the *Gen* hexagram.\nAt this time, the essence within the soul is half—\nlevel as a cord, called the \"last quarter.\"\nBefore this quarter belongs to yin, after it to yang—\nyang within yin half,\nyielding half a catty of water within gold,\nits flavor balanced, its qi-image complete.\n\nThe sage gathers these two eights,\ncaptures them in the furnace of creation to boil and forge.\nTrue Unity’s qi transforms into millet grains—\nswallowed into the belly,\nnurtured and steamed to become the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir.\nIt wholly relies on yin tally and yang fire,\nadvancing and retreating, withdrawing and adding—\nthe slightest deviation, and the Elixir Way is not achieved.\nThe Immortal Elder’s repeated exhortations in this chapter,\nurging self-refinement, are profoundly meaningful.\n\nFirst observe the heavens to discern the Five Thieves,\nnext examine the earth to settle the people.\nWhen the people are settled and the nation prosperous, then seek battle—\nonly through victory can one meet the sage.\nThe Five Thieves:\nin heaven, the five planets;\non earth, the five peaks;\namong spirits, the five emperors;\namong directions, the five regions;\nin humans, the five viscera;\nin conduct, the five constants;\nin things, the five phases, five colors, five qi, five notes,\nfive metals, five flavors, five grains—\nthese are the thieves.\nThe classic says: \"Heaven has five thieves—seeing them brings prosperity.\"\nIf one can perceive these and practice reversal,\nthen the cosmos is in hand, the myriad transformations arise in the body.\nExamining the earth’s principle, nothing surpasses settling the people—\nthe people are the state’s root;\nwhen the root is firm, the state is peaceful and the nation prosperous.\nThe sage takes the body as the state,\nessence and qi as the people,\nfire as the minister,\nthe Elixir as the ruler.\nIf we can personally seize the Five Thieves and practice reversal,\nsteal yin and yang to transform them,\nthen the true essence of Unity can be seized,\none’s own yin mercury instantly hardened,\nthe essence secured...\n\nQi secured, seek battle and victory is assured—thus fire is deployed without peril.\nWhen the tenth-month work is complete, the embryo sheds its mortal form to become a true immortal child,\nhence it is said: only through victory in battle can one behold the sage.\n\nSun and moon meet once every three ten-day periods,\ntiming replaces days in the method of divine work.\nDefending the city or waging field battle, one knows fortune and misfortune;\nadding numinous cinnabar, the crucible fills with crimson.\n\nGreat Yin and Great Yang conjoin once each month—\nthe sage models this,\ncondensing a month’s waiting into a single day,\nshifting a day’s waiting into a single hour.\nWhen deploying the tally-fire, defend the city and bathe;\nwhen ceasing field assault, dragon and tiger engage in combat.\n\nDivine work is the measure of advancing fire.\nShould yin and yang fall into disorder, sun and moon turn perverse,\nexternal fire may move and proceed, yet the inner tally remains still and unresponsive.\nThose with the Dao who advance fire and retreat water know fortune and misfortune,\nrevolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket in secret accord with celestial degrees—\nnaturally the numinous embryo circulates in concealment, the divine crucible gains radiance.\nThe treasured tally of yin surpasses three hundred,\nthe numinous scriptures of virtue and Dao fill five thousand.\nImmortals of past and present, without number,\nall attain the true explanation in this place.\n\nThe Two Classics govern all scriptures,\nserve as the pivot of all masters—\nfrom ancient times to now, those who attain the Dao do so through these.\nOn the fifteenth of the eighth month, admire the toad’s glow,\nfor this is when metal’s essence is at its peak.\nWhen the first yang begins to revive,\nadvance fire without delay.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the eighth month,\nprecisely when metal and water flourish,\nthe first yang revives—midnight at the hour of zi.\nInner and outer elixirs, fire-work proceeds in tandem;\nno delay is permissible, lest the season be lost.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world—\nfools point to mouth and nose and act in vain.\nThough you may practice breath-work for a thousand years,\nhow can you seize the golden crow and grapple the rabbit?\n\nThe classic says: “The gate of the Mysterious Female\nis called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nSubtle and continuous, its use is never exhausted.”\nWondrous indeed, these perfect words.\nThe world cannot know this—\nwithout a true person’s instruction, who could comprehend it?\n\nOf late, Ye Wenshu has claimed the space between the two kidneys to be the \"Primordial One Cavity,\" dismissing all other theories—yet this is even more erroneous. How could the Mysterious Female, a dual entity, be reduced to a single cavity? Since the dawn of creation, without these two, how could the myriad things arise? Thus, from them are established the inner and outer elixirs. The sages guarded this secret, naming it the \"Crescent Moon Crucible\" and the \"Suspended Womb Cauldron.\"\n\nThe golden crow is the golden elixir. The golden elixir governs my mercury, like a cat seizing a mouse or a crow grappling a rabbit—none can escape. To mistake the mouth and nose for the Mysterious Female is folly; even after a thousand years of breath-work, one only grows weaker with the rising sun. Do not take the gate of death for the gate of life, nor cling to the gate of life as the gate of death. Only when you grasp the mechanism of killing and its reversals do you perceive that harm conceals hidden grace.\n\nYin and yang, the Five Phases—following them brings life, defying them brings death: this is the common Dao. How could the mediocre know of the life that arises from non-life, or the supreme compliance born of non-compliance? If you fathom this principle of reversal—harm concealing grace—then even a man may conceive.\n\nThe \"killing mechanism\" is the \"mechanism of theft.\" When the moon hangs as a half-wheel at heaven’s edge, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound. Now is the time to refine the two eights; within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete. The half-wheel of the moon signifies the number eight. The immortal elder reveals that dragon and tiger each possess an eight, combining to form the two eights. The marvelous workings of the Dao all unfold within this single *shi* hour, when the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi yet no form.\n\nIn a year, there is but one such day. In a day, but one such *shi* hour. Within this hour, six *hou* periods are divided; applying effort for no more than two *hou* completes the golden elixir. The remaining four *hou* serve other purposes. This is celestial mechanics, not recorded on bamboo or silk, but transmitted mouth-to-heart. The immortal elder speaks of it as a single *shi* hour, hence \"within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete.\"\n\nYe Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, offered reckless interpretations, claiming the medicine forms in an instant rather than requiring the full hour. Bewildered, he groped in the dark with private conjecture—how laughable! If not for this single hour, would it not become a protracted schedule? How then could it be supremely simple and effortless?\n\nWondrous indeed! This Dao is not something one may hear of in the mortal world.\n\nAccording to Nan Guizi’s *Record of the Fire of the Great Elixir*: \"I have observed that when the sage begins the work of foundation and the initial refinement of lead, he steals the qi of the Three Origins and the great celestial cycle, seizing the 20,736,000 primordial qi. Gathering them in the cauldron of Qian and Kun, assembling them in the chamber of life and death, he exhausts the numbers of heaven and earth, the numbers of sun and moon, the numbers of dragon and tiger, the numbers of generation and completion, the numbers of yin and yang and the Five Phases. Capturing all in a single *shi* hour, he refines a single grain of sacred elixir, as large as a millet seed yet weighing one *jin*, most numinous and sagely, most exalted and noble. It is the primordial essence of heaven and earth, the sovereign of the body. Truly, he steals from heaven and earth, steals from yin and yang, holds the cosmos in his hand, engenders the myriad transformations within his person, and becomes a perfected immortal, a guest of the Supreme Emperor. Thus, my immortal teacher’s words—'within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete'—are no empty speech; this is the proof.\"\n\nFire is born of wood, yet its edge lies hidden; without skillful drilling, do not force the attack. Disaster erupts from this—harming oneself. To master it, seek the Golden Duke.\n\nThe classic says: \"Fire is born of wood, but disaster arises from mutual conquest. Essence resides in the body, yet when emotion stirs, it must dissipate.\" Without skillful drilling, this harms oneself.\n\nMaster Lü says: \"The fire burns the seven gates—seal them tightly, lest it scorch the River Chariot’s path. To master it, you must rely on the Golden Duke.\" The *Cantong Qi* states: \"To restrain it, the yellow sprout serves as the root.\"\n\nSetting up the crucible and establishing the cauldron follows Qian and Kun. Tempering the essence refines the po and hun. Gather the scattered to weave transformation; how dare I entrust such mysteries to mere words?\n\nAccumulated yang qi forms heaven, which, though above, does not moisten below. Accumulated yin qi forms earth, which, though below, does not blaze upward. Thus, heaven and earth do not interact. Without interaction, how can the myriad things be born? Though heaven is the most yang of things, it contains a qi of yin, enabling it to descend to earth. Though earth is the most yin of things, it contains a qi of yang, enabling it to ascend to heaven. When these two qi intertwine, the myriad things transform and mature. Through their interaction, change and transformation arise.\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir—setting up the crucible, establishing the cauldron, tempering the essence to refine the hun and po—all emulate heaven and earth. The *Song of the Mother and Child* says: \"When emotions interact, no medicine is needed; when qi harmonizes, no words are spoken.\" The golden elixir takes qi as its kind, binding it to engender transformation. Beginning from non-being to being, then from being back to non-being, its transformations are endless. This is celestial mechanics—how dare I prattle on, risking the fault of careless disclosure?\n\nThe thunderous fire of Kan refines the metal-water phase. Fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined. When these two substances harmonize, the medicine ripens, and fragrance suffuses the body.\n\nThe \"thunderous fire of Kan\" is the fire within water, called the \"yin tally,\" the bowstring qi of the tiger. The \"metal-water phase\" is the Qian position of the northwest, which is the dragon. The west is also the Gate of Heaven, called the Mysterious Gate. Here, the tiger’s fire within yin refines the Qian dragon. The dragon then stirs the fire of Kunlun in response. When the two fires merge, the essence of the True One naturally congeals. Harvest and ingest it at once, and the hundred bones are all ordered—fragrant and delightful.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: \"When golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and clouds. Steaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes joyful and radiant.\"\n\nThe temples turn black, and new teeth regrow.\nThe old man reverts to youthful vigor, the aged woman becomes a radiant maiden.\nIs this not the true fragrance suffusing the body?\n\nAfter ingesting the elixir, circulate the fire of the yin-yang tally.\nThe tiger refines the Mysterious Gate with the fire within yin, while the dragon stirs the fire of Kunlun in response.\nWhen the two harmonize, the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir naturally ripens with fragrance, suffusing the body with radiance—fragrant and delightful.\n\nThe poem speaks of the inner and outer elixirs’ symbolic resonance:\n*To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying,*\n*Rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.*\n\nWhen true gold returns to the Yellow Gold Chamber,\na single orb of radiant light abides forever.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"What is unfathomable in yin and yang is called the numinous.\"\nThe formless responds and thus communicates—like an echo in a valley—hence the \"Valley Spirit.\"\nThe spirit arises from qi, and qi is born of essence.\nEssence generates qi, qi generates spirit.\nThus, spirit and qi govern the body, while the body serves as the vessel of spirit and qi.\nWithout form, spirit and qi cannot live; without spirit and qi, form cannot stand.\nThese three depend on one another to engender life.\n\nTo attain longevity, rely on the Mysterious Female.\nOnce the root is established, immortality may be achieved.\nAll things are born of these two, and by these two they die.\nThey are the root of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of the Five Phases,\nthe stem of yin and yang, the foundation of the myriad transformations.\nThe sage uses them to refine the outer elixir and relies on them to complete the inner medicine.\nThus, the essence of the True One returns to the Yellow Gold Chamber,\nmanifesting as a single orb of numinous light.\nThe body transforms into qi, qi into spirit—\nform and spirit both perfected, merging with the Dao in truth,\nhidden and revealed beyond measure.\n\nThe Three Powers plunder one another’s sustenance;\nthe Dao secures immortality by concealing this mechanism.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace, all concerns cease,\nand the hundred bones are ordered, verifying non-action.\n\nHeaven and Earth plunder the myriad things through the four seasons,\nhence flourishing and withering without perpetual bloom.\nThe myriad things plunder humans through the five flavors,\nhence life and death without perpetual longevity.\nHumans plunder the myriad things through the Five Phases,\nhence decay and renewal without enduring existence.\n\nWhen the Three Plunderings are harmonized and the Three Powers settled,\nthere arise prosperity and decline, life and death,\nflourishing and withering, day and night,\ncoming and going, emergence and submergence,\ndecline and rise, self and other,\nright and wrong—endlessly arising in cyclical flux,\nthe natural Dao.\n\nIf one can unify these Three Plunderings, reverse their mechanism, and seize it,\ndefy the seasons to consume them,\nthen the hundred bones are ordered, the myriad transformations at peace.\nWhen the myriad transformations are at peace, all concerns cease.\n\n*When negativity and positivity first meet, the myriad things flourish;*\n*When difficulty and simplicity receive the hexagram, life and completion are bestowed.*\n\nGrasp the meaning here—do not seek mere images.\nTo exhaust the lines is but to weary the mind.\n\nThe solstices of winter and summer mark the origins of yin and yang,\nwhile the hours of midnight and noon are the pivots of day and night.\nThe sage moves the tally of yin and the fire of yang,\naligning with the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the ascent and descent of yin and yang,\nthe principles of the sun and moon’s movements.\nGathering the four seasons, eight trigrams, seventy-two pentads, and twenty-four qi,\nthey array them within the crucible to form the body of the True One.\nThe principle is simple, the effort unburdensome—\nno reckless action is permitted, hence the reliance on hexagrams.\n\nWithin the three ten-day periods of a month,\nthe mystery is expounded, and the fire’s application clarified.\nThe lines and images are but fishing traps.\n*Difficulty* and *Simplicity* are the first of the hexagrams,\nsymbolizing the inception of fire’s movement and creation’s endowment.\nThus, *Difficulty* governs the morning, *Simplicity* the evening—\nthe work of qi passes thus.\n\nAs for the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang within the four seasons:\nAt the spring equinox in the second month, yang ascends to the center of Heaven and Earth,\nyin and yang equally balanced, neither cold nor hot but temperate—\nhence the *Peace* hexagram, like the waxing moon’s climate.\nHere, yin and yang qi naturally merge,\nand the sage does not advance the fire—this is called \"bathing.\"\n\nAt the autumn equinox in the eighth month, yin descends to the center of Heaven and Earth,\nagain yin and yang equally balanced, neither hot nor cold but cool—\nhence the *Stagnation* hexagram, like the waning moon’s climate.\nHere, yin and yang qi also naturally merge,\nand the sage does not advance the water—this too is called \"bathing.\"\n\nIf one grasps the meaning within these four hexagrams,\nwhy cling to the lines and weary the mind with laborious thought?\nThe immortal sage, in compassion, directly points to this shortcut.\n\nAs the common saying aligns with the sagely Dao,\none should seek diligently within it.\nIf one inverts the search in daily use,\nthe dust of the earth all becomes treasure.\n\nTrue lead and true mercury are not apart from common speech, everyday words, and daily life.\nInverting their cultivation, the whole earth becomes supreme treasure.\n\nAn ancient poem says:\n*Day after day, only in your dwelling,*\n*Following you daily, yet you remain unaware.*\n\nHeaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness have their time—\nonly by discerning their ebb and flow can one know the mechanism.\n\nSince ancient times, the decree of *geng* and *jia* has been proclaimed,\nslaying all yin-corpse, the Dao may then be attained.\n\nThat Heaven and Earth wax and wane in their seasons—\nthis is because Heaven and Earth are separated by eighty-four thousand *li*.\nAt the Winter Solstice, within the center of Earth, a single yang *qi* ascends,\nrising each day four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu*.\nFive days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*,\nthree *qi* make one *jie*, and two *jie* make one season—\nthis is the Spring Equinox.\nCounting ninety days, the yang *qi* ascends in total forty-two thousand *li*,\nprecisely to the midpoint between Heaven and Earth.\nAt this time, yin holds half of yang, forming the hexagram *Tai*.\nIts *qi* transforms from cold to warm,\nthe time when the myriad things arise—this is spring.\n\nFrom this point onward, yang *qi* enters the yang position,\nascending as before, gradually reaching the Summer Solstice.\nIncluding the prior count, one hundred eighty days have passed,\nand the *qi* has ascended eighty-four thousand *li*, arriving at Heaven.\nAt this time, yang holds yang, forming the hexagram *Qian*—pure yang.\nIts *qi* transforms from warm to hot, thus it is called summer.\nThe time when the myriad things flourish and reach fullness—thus it is called \"waxing.\"\n\nNow, when heat reaches its extreme, yin arises.\nThus, at the Summer Solstice, a single yin descends from Heaven,\nalso descending each day four hundred sixty *li* and two hundred forty *bu*.\nFive days make one *hou*, three *hou* make one *qi*,\nthree *qi* make one *jie*, and two *jie* make one season—\nthis is the Autumn Equinox.\nCounting ninety days, the yin *qi* descends in total forty-two thousand *li*,\nprecisely to the midpoint between Heaven and Earth.\nAt this time, yang holds half of yin, forming the hexagram *Pi*.\nIts *qi* transforms from hot to cool,\nthe time when the myriad things bear fruit—this is the Autumn Equinox.\n\nFrom this point onward, yin enters the yin position,\ndescending as before, gradually reaching the Winter Solstice.\nIncluding the prior count, one hundred eighty days have passed,\nand the *qi* has descended eighty-four thousand *li*, arriving at Earth.\nAt this time, yin holds yin, forming the pure yin hexagram *Kun*.\nIts *qi* transforms from cool to cold, thus it is called winter.\nThe time when the myriad things withdraw and store away—thus it is called \"waning.\"\n\nThe waxing and waning of Heaven and Earth are revealed through the moon.\nThe moon is born from the sun.\nOn the third day, *Zhen* *geng* takes form;\non the eighth day, *Dui* *ding* completes the crescent.\nOn the fifteenth day, *Qian* *jia* reaches fullness—\nthe time when Heaven and Earth wax.\nOn the sixteenth day, *Xun* *xin* assumes governance;\non the twenty-third day, *Gen* *bing* guards the crescent.\nOn the thirtieth day, *Kun* *yi* dissolves—\nthe time when Heaven and Earth wane.\n\nThe sage discerns the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning,\ntransferring the *qi* and *hou* of a year into a single month.\nThe first day is taken as the Winter Solstice,\ndividing two and a half days into thirty periods to correspond with the month’s *qi* and *hou*.\nThus, on the third day, the moon appears as a crescent upon *geng*.\nOn the eighth day, the first quarter—yin holding half of yang—\nis like the Spring Equinox.\nBy the fifteenth day, it receives the *qi* of the fourth month’s node,\nbecoming pure yang; thus, the moon is full.\nAs the yang *qi* fills the wheel, it is called \"waxing.\"\nOn this evening, the moon emerges from the *jia* direction.\nOn the sixteenth day, a single yin arises, gradually waning upon *geng*—\nthis is the Summer Solstice.\nOn the twenty-third day, the last quarter—yang holding half of yin—\nresembles the Autumn Equinox.\nBy the thirtieth day, it receives the *qi* of the tenth month’s node,\nbecoming pure yin filling the wheel—thus it is called \"waning.\"\nAt dawn on this day, the moon turns toward *jia*,\nconjoining with the sun to regenerate yang light,\ncycling endlessly.\n\nMoving the yin tally and yang fire,\neach following the waxing and waning, ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth,\ncirculating through the sixty-four hexagrams,\nembodying the principle of roundness and waning from *geng* to *jia*,\noperating the withdrawal and addition—\nthis is like a ruler proclaiming decrees.\nThus it is said: \"Slaying all yin-corpse, the Dao may be attained.\"\n\nOuye personally transmitted the sword-forging method,\nmatching Ye Stream’s metal and water with softness and hardness.\nOnce refined, it understands human intent,\nslaying evil across ten thousand *li* in a flash of lightning.\n\nMaster Ouye forged the sword,\nwith Heaven and Earth sending a divine maiden to tend the furnace.\nIt was tempered with metal and water, paired with softness and hardness,\nand once refined, it could slay demons and evil—\nin a flash of lightning, its numinosity was thus.\n\nThe sage’s cauldron-forging is likewise:\ntaking Heaven and Earth as the furnace,\nyin and yang as water and fire,\npaired with the Five Phases,\ntempered with spirit-*qi*.\nOnce refined, it can bend or straighten,\nsoften or harden,\ndo good or evil,\nbe round or square.\nWhen the mind conceives a thought, the intent directs its course,\nsoaring to slay—\nin a flash of lightning.\nThis is the natural divine sword.\n\nIf the cultivator of the elixir lacks this sword,\nit is like seeking fish and hare without traps and snares.\nThe immortal sage, borrowing Ouye’s words,\ntruly speaks of the elusive and formless Mysterious Pearl.\n\nDifferent names arise from the same source—few know this.\nThese two mysteries are the essential mechanism.\nPreserving life and completing form, clarifying gain and loss,\nthe purple-gold elixir is most wondrous and numinous.\n\nThe scripture says:\n\"The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nThe named is the mother of the myriad things.\"\nIt also says:\n\"These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names.\"\nWhen it is formless, the true one’s *qi* is mercury—\ninvisible, thus it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nWhen it takes form, the true one’s *qi* appears like a millet grain in the empty mystery—\nas lead, it becomes visible, thus it is the mother of Heaven and Earth.\nIn Heaven, it is called *Li* and mercury;\non Earth, it is called *Kan* and lead.\nTheir root is the same, yet their emergence differs—\nthis is called \"mysterious and again mysterious.\"\n\nThe superior adept, the perfected one, grasps this dual mystery’s mechanism,\nclarifying gain and loss to govern the body.\nThen form may be preserved, and life may be safeguarded.\nWhat is called \"loss\" is the Five Phases in sequence—\nthe common Dao, where there is birth and death.\nWhat is called \"gain\" is the Five Phases in reversal—\nthe elixir body, eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nAlas! The pure yang purple-gold stands at the beginning of Heaven and Earth,\nemerges from the mother of Heaven and Earth.\nThus it is said: the purple-gold true medicine is most wondrous and numinous.\nOne should know the boundless admiration of the former masters.\n\nTo empty the heart and fill the abdomen holds profound meaning—\nit is but to empty the heart so the knowing mind may settle.\nYet better to first fill the abdomen by refining lead,\nthen guard and gather the hall brimming with gold.\n\nTo empty the heart is to be without self;\nwithout self, the ten thousand dharmas are all void, not a thread stands.\nTo fill the abdomen is to refine lead and dry mercury;\nwhen mercury dries and form dissolves, it merges with the Dao, becoming formless.\nBoth principles are wondrous, distinct paths converging as one—\nnone but the great sage can comprehend this.\n\nTo guard and gather the hall brimming with gold\nis to tend the essence, qi, and spirit within the body.\nThe cultivator of truth who has not yet refined lead to dry mercury\nhas an unfilled abdomen and an unemptied heart—\nthen nothing can stabilize your essence, and with scant essence,\nthe returning elixir cannot be completed.\n\nThe great medicine’s cultivation may be easy or difficult—\nknow that it depends on oneself, yet also on Heaven.\nIf one has not accumulated deeds of hidden virtue,\nat every turn, demonic obstructions will arise.\nDemonic obstructions lie in Heaven, but cultivation rests with oneself.\nWithout bestowing hidden virtue, obstacles block every path.\n\nWithin blackness, white is the elixir’s mother;\nwithin the male, the female is embraced—this is the sacred embryo.\nThe Great One in the crucible must be guarded with care;\nthe Three Fields gather treasures, corresponding to the Three Terraces.\n\nExtracting silver from lead becomes the elixir’s mother;\ndrawing mercury from cinnabar is the sacred embryo.\nThese two substances, stirred by the true unity of qi and essence,\ncongeal within the crucible—only by keenly observing the qi’s timing,\nstrictly adhering to the method, and allowing not the slightest deviation,\ncan the three natures converge, coalescing into the elixir-treasure,\naligning above with the Three Terraces.\n\nThe eldest son suddenly drinks wine from the west;\nthe youngest daughter first blooms a flower in the north.\nIf the Blue Maiden and they meet thereafter,\nall at once the lock opens to dwell in the Yellow House.\n\nZhen represents the eldest son, the Dragon. Dui represents the youngest daughter, the Tiger. The northern land is the yin entity. The \"flower of yin qi\" is the Tiger’s bowstring qi, called lead-fire. The Blue Maiden is the Alchemical Maiden, the Dragon’s bowstring qi, called mercury-fire. This speaks of the adept refining the elixir, driving the Dragon to approach the Tiger—hence \"suddenly drinks wine from the west.\" The Tiger then opens the yin-gate’s flower to meet the Dragon. When the Azure Dragon’s mercury-fire and White Tiger’s lead-fire unite in love, they seal and converge in the Yellow House, producing the essence of the true One—thus \"if the Blue Maiden and they meet thereafter, all at once the lock opens to dwell in the Yellow House.\"\n\nWithin the crescent moon crucible, jade algae arise;\nin the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels even.\nOnly when fire-force is harmonized,\ndoes the yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\nThe crescent moon crucible is the yin crucible, containing the yang qi of jade algae—the Tiger’s bowstring qi. The cinnabar tripod is the yang tripod, containing the yin qi of mercury—the Dragon’s bowstring qi. The golden elixir arises solely from the harmonious union of these two bowstring fires. Once balanced, the sprout of the true One takes root in the Yellow House, maturing into a grain of millet.\n\nDreaming of an audience with Western Florescence, ascending to the Nine Heavens,\nI was clearly bestowed the *Zhixuan* scroll.\nIts words were few and simple,\nonly teaching one to refine mercury and lead.\n\nGao Xiangxian said: Lost in meditation, my soul ascended to Jade Capital. The Lord took pity and commanded Lady Western Florescence to reveal the elixir formula. Its scroll briefly stated:\n*\"Shu Tong engaged in the work, Wei Boyang led the way,\nlaughing as they entered the Land of Nothing-Whatsoever.\nFollowing the *Lianshan*, they composed the *Cantongqi*,\nleaving it as the eternal sovereign of ten-thousand-generation elixirs.\"*\nIts opening lines read:\n*\"Qian and Kun are the gates of the Yi,\nQian’s Way is male, Kun’s Way is female.\nYet people know not true yin and yang,\nvaguely seeking Dragon and Tiger across the world.\"*\nThough its words are many, it only teaches one to recognize the true Dragon and true Tiger, to refine lead and mercury.\n\nAfter bathing in the Flowery Pond, the moon’s radiance clears;\nriding a golden dragon, I visit the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\ntides and valleys shift at will.\n\nThe Flowery Pond is the elixir. Once consumed, the work is complete—transformation is divine. The skin becomes like ice and snow, the form graceful as a maiden, the countenance bright as the autumn moon. Riding qi upon clouds, wandering the boundless, I observe the mortal world: seas turn to mulberry fields, mulberry fields to seas.\n\nWithout refining the returning elixir, do not retreat to the mountains.\nWithin and without the mountains, all is not lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nyet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.\n\nThe Dragon is not in the eastern sea, nor the Tiger in the western mountains. Every household possesses them. Reverse the process and refine them, and the returning elixir may be attained. The mountains’ yin stillness, inside and out, is not lead—lead is the true yang entity, not distant at all.\n\nEven if one knows cinnabar and black lead,\nwithout knowing the fire-timing, it is as idle as leisure.\nThe work depends entirely on the power of cultivation;\nthe slightest deviation prevents the elixir’s formation.\n\nThe golden elixir’s transformation relies wholly on the Metal Lord.\nThe slightest error creates a gulf of a thousand miles.\nThus the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire.\n\nDo not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort;\nto refine the medicine, seek the crescent moon crucible.\nIt naturally possesses true fire for nurturing—\nno need for firewood, charcoal, or bellows.\n\nYe Wenshu misidentified the space between the two kidneys as the crescent moon crucible—how mistaken! Unwilling to reflect on his own error, he further misled others with his flawed path. How reckless! This crucible’s mouth opens upward like an inverted crescent, hence its name. It is the Northern Sea, where the primordial ancestral qi resides. Within it dwells natural true fire—what need is there for firewood, charcoal, or bellows?\n\nWhen the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nthe lead tripod warms gently, illuminating the curtains.\nAt the initial reception of qi, it is easily obtained;\nin withdrawal and addition, exercise utmost caution.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs, it is the position of the *ninth yang*, the hidden dragon. Act swiftly, and the work may be completed in due time—why wait nine years or three? Who knows that at the very beginning of the work, the radiant golden elixir, large as a grain of millet, is gathered into the Yellow Court and nurtured into the supreme treasure?\n\nThe lead tripod is the Cavern-Yang Golden Tripod, existing in the void and profound obscurity—it is the natural tripod. Lead is the entity within primordial emptiness. After commencing the work, the lead tripod warms gently, like fire’s attack, like clouds’ spread, harmonizing temperament and suffusing the seas and mountains. If the lead is true, it does not lose its role as the household minister. Thus lead is the ancestral founder, dwelling within the Mysterious Female, the root of heaven and earth. Without tranquility, it cannot be completed; without application, it cannot be obtained—its Way is most wondrous.\n\n\"Illuminating the curtains\" refers to the radiant essence overflowing during refinement, and after practice, even the finest hairs become visible, revealing the organs within. \"Receiving qi\" refers to the initial reception of qi, when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—success lies in receiving qi. \"Guarding against danger\" refers to the peril in withdrawal and addition. Know its hidden subtleties, weigh them carefully, and do not neglect the timing. In application, guard against danger and do not underestimate the process—hence the risk of withdrawal and addition.\n\nThe marvelous qi of heaven and earth follows the *Yi*’s symbolic method. Have you not heard? With a single swing of the *jia*-sword, demonic armies scatter—this is the power of harmony.\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl takes form as yang arises;\nwhen yang reaches its peak, yin dissipates, stripping away all form.\nAfter ten months, frost descends and the elixir ripens—\neven gods and ghosts must then stand in awe.\n\nThe Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, when warmed, takes form. From the winter solstice’s yang hour at midnight, advance the yang fire, thus generating true essence as yang pursues it. From the summer solstice’s yin hour at noon, advance the yin tally, stripping away until the tenth month’s frost-descending time, when the returning elixir finally ripens. Shedding the embryo and transforming into a purely yang Heavenly Immortal, even ghosts are startled and gods submit.\n\nIn the months of the Hare and Rooster, at their appointed times,\nPunishment and Virtue arrive at the gate—these are the elixir’s symbols.\n\nAt this stage, the golden sand must be bathed—\nif fire is added further, peril and ruin will follow.\nThe second month of the Hare is governed by Virtue,\nthe eighth month of the Rooster by Punishment.\nThese two months mark the time for bathing,\nwhen fire should cease; if recklessly applied, the elixir will scatter and be lost.\n\nThe songs and scriptures expound the truth,\nyet never commit the fire-tending to written word.\nTo grasp the oral secrets that unlock the mystery,\none must discuss them in detail with an immortal sage.\nThe *Fire Records* span six hundred chapters,\neach echoing the last, interwoven and aligned with heaven’s pattern.\nWhat heaven conceals, sages do not transmit in writing—\nonly when meeting a true master may one proceed, never with haste.\n\nThough your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,\nwithout encountering a perfected one, do not force conjecture.\nFor the elixir scriptures lack the oral transmission—\nwhere then can you conceive the numinous embryo?\nA thousand classics, ten thousand treatises\nbut scatter only branches and leaves.\nThe supreme Way is not complex—\nit is transmitted solely as the mind-seal.\nWithout a true master, even one brighter than Yan and Min\nwill only speculate in vain, never coalescing the sacred embryo.\n\nTo know the method of refining and nurturing the returning elixir,\nplant the seed in your own garden.\nNo need for forced effort or boastful claims—\nnaturally, the fruit will ripen and the true embryo emerge.\nThis Way is most near, like sowing in your own garden—\nits proximity is self-evident.\nTo seek what is not of your kind is to stray ever farther.\nWhen kindred forces act, what effort is required?\n\nWhen the Four Symbols converge, the mysterious body takes form;\nwhere the Five Directions move, purple radiance shines.\nThe embryo shed, taken into the mouth, the whole body becomes sacred—\ncountless dragons and spirits silently shudder in awe.\nAs soon as Dragon and Tiger unite,\nthe Five Phases and Four Symbols all converge.\nAt the meeting of Five Phases and Four Symbols,\nthe true One’s mysterious body coalesces into a grain of millet, glowing purple.\nThen, stealthily guiding the Red Dragon,\nseize it and return it to the upward-facing vessel, swallowing it into the cinnabar field—\ninstantly, the body becomes divine, and heaven, earth, dragons, and spirits all stand in astonishment.\n\nGolden Duke was originally the son of the Eastern House,\nyet lodged in the Western Neighbor to be born.\nRecognize and summon him home to nurture,\npair him with the Maiden of Vermilion to forge kinship.\nThis meaning was already conveyed in the ninth verse of the previous four—\nnow I refrain from repeating it.\nAll lies within the workings and symbolic forms:\nthere is yang within yin, reverting to yang and then to yin again;\nthere is yin within yang, reverting to yin and then to yang again.\nThere are inner and outer medicines of yin-yang, water-fire;\ninner and outer Three Essences;\ninner and outer Five Phases and Four Symbols.\nThere are also methods of mutual interaction between inner and outer yin-yang—\nendlessly shifting, beyond description.\nWe may silently comprehend it in the heart, but without encountering the true teaching,\nnone can fully fathom its depths.\nThe immortal elder composed this poem so that the enlightened, grasping one corner, may suffice.\n\nAll things in profusion return to their root—\nreturning to the root and reviving the mandate ensures everlasting existence.\nTo know the constant and return to the origin is rare among men;\nreckless action invites misfortune, as often heard.\nThe scripture says: All things in profusion return to their root.\nReturning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called reviving the mandate.\nReviving the mandate is called the constant; knowing the constant is called illumination.\nBefore a person is born, they dwell in profound obscurity, merged with primal simplicity.\nAt birth, they discern yin and yang, receive them from father and mother—\nreversing the course, one seizes the precelestial qi as the elixir’s mother,\nplunders the true qi of yin and yang as the foundation of transformation,\nrefines the form to reenter formlessness,\nrefines qi to restore it to primal simplicity,\nrefines spirit to unite with the Dao—\nthus, returning to the root and reviving the mandate ensures everlasting existence.\nThose who know the constant Way and return to their origin are sages—\nhence they attain long life.\nThose who do not know the constant Way are the common folk—\nhence their reckless actions invite misfortune, as often heard.\n\nThe Red Dragon and Black Tiger meet east and west,\nthe Four Symbols intertwine at wu-ji.\nOnce reunited, they naturally operate—\nwho says the golden elixir cannot be achieved?\nEast is the qi of the Red Dragon’s bowstring, called the Maiden of Vermilion.\nWest is the qi of the Black Tiger’s bowstring, called Golden Duke.\nThese two are like mercury within cinnabar, silver within lead.\nWhen the Red Dragon and Black Tiger unite the qi of the two bowstrings,\nit is the Four Symbols of south, north, east, and west intertwining at wu-ji,\nforming a single grain of millet.\nIngested into the cinnabar field, then guide the fire beginning with the *Fu* hexagram at the yang hour of midnight,\nfirst advancing the yang fire.\nFrom the *Gou* hexagram at the yin hour of noon, first advancing the yin tally.\n*Fu* and *Gou* are the origins of yin and yang, marking the winter and summer solstices.\nThe yin tally and yang fire begin here—\ndrawing and adding, operating all according to method, never deviating—\nwho would say the Golden Mother cannot be perfected?\n\nIf you have not refined the returning elixir, refine it with haste;\nonce refined, you must know when to stop and be content.\nIf you persist with an insatiable heart,\nyou will inevitably suffer humiliation one day.\nTime flies swiftly, and it waits for no one—\nif you have not refined the returning elixir, begin at once.\nOnce refined, with ten months of work complete,\nyou must embrace the One and guard unity, maintaining fullness and defending the city—\nno need for further fire.\nIf you do not know contentment and persist without cease,\nyou will instead invite calamity and disgrace.\nThus, Master Zhongli said: When the elixir ripens, do not apply fire—\nif you apply fire, you will harm the elixir.\nAt this stage, if you can sincerely perceive your nature,\nlike Bodhidharma facing the wall for nine years, the Way will be achieved.\n\nAt first, through effort, people seek it;\nby the time it becomes effortless, the crowd understands.\nYet they see only effortlessness as the essential Way—\nhow would they know that effort is the root?\nSome who study the Buddha’s path of cultivating nature\ncling to the notion that all effort is delusion, disparaging the Daoist path of refining life.\nThey know one aspect but not the other, glimpsing the gate but never ascending the hall—\nhow would they know that the path of refining life begins with effort,\nrefining the outer medicine to transform the form;\nproceeds with action, refining the form to transform qi;\nand ultimately attains effortless freedom—\nholding to the One to recognize the heart and perceive the nature,\nqi naturally returns to spirit, spirit naturally unites with the Dao,\nso that form and spirit together become wondrous and unfathomable,\nspirit and Dao unite in truth and formlessness.\n\nWhen form has ceased to be, how can one speak of form, of action, of effort, of illusion?\nHow can one assert that life is not nature, or that nature is not life?\nForcibly dividing them into \"nature\" and \"life\"—when merged as one, they were never distinct.\nThus, from action to non-action, from form to formlessness, the Way reaches its ultimate—\na truth beyond the grasp of those of middling or lesser capacity.\n\nThe Immortal Elder composed this poem to admonish later students:\nthey see only effortlessness as the essential mystery,\nyet fail to recognize that action and effort are the very root of effortlessness.\n\nAn alternate version reads:\n*The trap and net in hand—none know my art.*\n*Once ashore, the boat is cast aside; in ten months, one stares in vain.*\n*Saints and mortals mingle in the marketplace, fish and dragons blend on the thoroughfare.*\n*How vexing for the people of this world—face to face, yet never meeting.*\n\nThe method of *observing form, sealing qi, and contemplating spirit*:\nat first, the path is arduous; later, it becomes smooth and unobstructed.\nIn an instant, one may traverse ten thousand lands—\nsuch is the subtle clarity of the yin spirit.\nYet alas, the form remains yin, prone to decay and difficult to stabilize,\ninevitably leading to rebirth through womb-seizing or body-snatching.\n\nThose who practice *womb-seizing, body-snatching, or relocation* are called the \"Four Fruits\" disciples—\ntheir cultivation pertains to the yin spirit, making them ghost-immortals, not yang-immortals.\nIf one can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger, refine and ingest the golden elixir,\ntransforming form into formlessness to become a yang-immortal,\nonly then does form and spirit together attain wondrousness, uniting with the Dao in truth—\nnever withering, how could this compare to the yin spirit?\nThus, Master Cui said:\n*The numinous light departs, entering profound stillness—*\n*one dies as a radiant ghost of the yin realm.*\n\nThe Buddha’s teaching urges cultivation toward the Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nfor that bliss is none other than the golden realm.\nIn truth, only this form is real—\nthe other two are but vain speculations.\n\nWhen the Buddha taught beings to cultivate the Cold Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nhe referred to the image of wondrous golden hue.\nIn recent times, those who chant the Buddha’s name and transform beings speak of the Pure Land—\nthis is but a teaching for the middling and lesser,\na speck of dust for those of great root and capacity.\nLittle do they know that the true Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Pure Land,\nlies in the West, not far at all—\nthere, true gold is nurtured, each grain as large as a millet seed, weighing sixteen ounces.\nThus, the Buddha is said to possess a sixteen-foot golden body.\nIf one can refine and ingest this true gold, one instantly transcends to the sacred realm,\ntransforming the formed into the formless.\nWhen gathered, the golden form stands majestic; when dispersed, it enters into emptiness,\nits transformations boundless, its movements unfathomable—\nresponding to conditions, pervading all, yet the true body remains quiescent, never acting.\nThis is the Land of Ultimate Bliss in the West.\n\nHence it is said: *In truth, only this form is real—*\n*the other two are but vain speculations.*\n\nThe Buddha entered nirvana at the end of the Zhou dynasty;\nseveral centuries later, during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han,\nhis relics were retrieved and reburied in Fengxiang.\nEmperor Xianzong of Tang later unearthed a bone—\nhow could they have known it was the supreme Way of the Yellow Emperor ascending to heaven on a dragon?\n\nWithin the indistinct and elusive, there is an image;\nwithin the obscure and unfathomable, there is true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being naturally interpenetrate—\nhow can one conceive of it without first perceiving it?\n\nThat within the indistinct and elusive is the *qi* of the dragon’s bowstring;\nthat within the obscure and unfathomable is the essence of the tiger’s bowstring.\nThe two bowstrings possess *qi* but no substance—\nvague and elusive, obscure and unfathomable,\ninvisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear—\nthis is the true One’s *qi*, numinous yet formless.\n\nThe True One said:\n*Non-being is the dragon; being is the tiger.*\n*Non-being is the qi of mercury; being is the essence of lead.*\nThus, when the *qi* of the two bowstrings intertwine,\nnon-being, moved by being, generates numinosity;\nbeing, stirred by non-being, takes form.\nOnly through the mutual interpenetration of being and non-being\ndoes the true One’s *qi* condense into a millet grain,\nsuspended in the void, its radiance illuminating the sun.\nHow could those who sit in dull contemplation, their minds mired in dust,\never comprehend this?\n\nIn cultivation, blend with the world and harmonize your light;\nbe round when round, square when square.\nConcealed or manifest, yielding or resisting—none can fathom your conduct.\nHow then could others perceive your way of being?\n\nWearing coarse cloth while holding jade,\nharmonizing your light with the dust,\nbreaking through barriers,\ntranscending self and other,\nuniting inner and outer—\nonly then does one embody the immortal’s way of concealment and revelation.\n\n---\n\n**Five Additional Verses**\n\nCease all cunning and false exertions;\nrecognize instead the other’s deathless method.\nIn the flask, ever replenish the wine of life;\nin the crucible, gather the nectar of returning soul.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n*Kindred methods yield results with ease;*\n*unrelated arts demand cunning labor.*\nYet many cultivators cling to unrelated, false methods,\nexerting effort upon themselves while refusing to seek the other’s kindred, deathless way.\nIf one can extract from the crucible the yang elixir of returning to the root,\nand within the abdomen ever replenish the mercury fire of life extension—\nthese two are the supreme treasures for refining the body.\n\nFortune and misfortune arise in mutual dependence,\nlike shadow following form, echo answering sound.\nIf one can reverse the mechanism of life and death,\nthen in the turn of a palm, calamity transforms into blessing.\n\nYang governs life and is called fortune;\nyin governs death and is called misfortune.\nAs yin wanes and yang waxes, yang at its peak gives rise to yin—\nmutually dependent, like shadow and echo,\nthis is the natural principle of the common Way.\nIf one can reverse this mechanism of life and death through counter-cultivation,\nthen in the turn of a palm, calamity becomes blessing,\nharm gives birth to grace—\neven a man may conceive.\n\nStriking bamboo to summon the tortoise that swallows the jade mushroom,\nPlucking the zither to call the phoenix that drinks the elixir spoon.\nOf late, a golden light distinct suffuses the body—\nthis rule is not for common folk to speak of.\n\nBamboo embodies hollow-heartedness and non-attachment;\nthe zither holds the meaning of upright sound and harmonious resonance.\nThe tortoise is the Black Tiger,\nthe phoenix is the Red Dragon.\nThe Dragon’s string-qi is called the jade mushroom,\nthe Tiger’s child-qi is called the elixir spoon.\nThis speaks of Dragon and Tiger as passionless beings,\nyet capable of union—thus “striking bamboo” signifies their mutual engagement.\nWhen Dragon and Tiger unite as husband and wife in harmony,\nthis is called “plucking the zither.”\nAs Dragon and Tiger couple, the two string-qi devour each other,\nrefining into the golden elixir.\nLight pierces the curtain,\nand in that moment, gather it—\ningest it into the cinnabar field,\nsubduing one’s own yin mercury.\nThen, with hollow heart, circulate the fire,\nharmonizing yin and yang,\naligning with breath.\nThrough breath, direct the spirit-qi,\ngathering and dispersing water and fire.\nWith water and fire, refine and nurture the embryonic breath,\ncontinuously, as if ever-present—\nswimming between Kan and Li,\ntheir intercourse gives birth to the golden liquid.\nThus, when circulating the fire,\nshould you suddenly feel the true qi surge up the spine to the Mud Pill Palace,\ntrickling with sound,\nas if something touches the crown of the brain—\nin an instant, like sparrow’s eggs, grain by grain,\nit ascends from the palate into the Tower of Multi-Storied Chambers,\ncool as ice, sweet as butter, its flavor beyond compare.\nIf this occurs, you have attained the Way of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir.\nGently swallow it down to the cinnabar field,\nunceasingly, without interruption.\nThe five viscera become clear and empty,\nand with eyes closed, an inner vision reveals light like a candle.\nFrom within the five viscera, ten thousand strands of golden light emerge from the body,\nlike wheels of fire and clouds of mist,\nspiraling to envelop the form—\nradiant and wondrous,\nhow could it be compared to the dust-borne multitudes?\n\nOnce the monkey-heart is stilled and the mind’s mechanism is clear,\nthree thousand merits fulfilled, you stand equal with heaven.\nNaturally, there is a crucible to refine Dragon and Tiger—\nwhy cling to household and yearn for wife and child?\nAfter worldly passions thicken, the Dao-heart is hard to know.\nEach person bears their home and loves their wife and children,\nunaware of the Way of returning to the root.\nThe Immortal Elder sighs in lament,\ncomposing this to admonish those who cultivate the true.\n\nEven if you awaken to the true suchness of nature,\nyou may yet cast off the body only to re-enter it.\nThough you transform and refine the great medicine anew,\nyou transcend the leakless to become a true person.\nBefore the great function manifests,\nbefore the great dharma is fully illuminated,\nthe slightest leakage means casting off the body to re-enter it.\nBut if you achieve perfect clarity and illumination,\nfully refine the golden elixir,\nand complete the ten stages of the Dao,\nyou are called a true person.\n\n*Thirteen Western River Moon Songs*\nThe Immortal Elder says:\n“West” is the direction of metal.\n“River” is the essence of water.\n“Moon” is the function of the medicine.\nThe inner medicine resembles the outer medicine;\ninner communication requires outer communication as well.\nThe elixir head harmonizes similarly,\nwith two kinds of nurturing as its function.\n\nThe *Breaking Delusion Song* of Yi Gate says:\nThe Dao lies in setting up the inner furnace,\nwhile establishing the crucible resides in the outer Way.\nIn the outer, Li and Kan;\nmercury and lead return within.\nThis clarifies the two medicines, inner and outer.\n\nThe outer medicine is the golden elixir.\nIt is wrought in the furnace of the two eights,\ncompleted in less than half a day.\nThe inner medicine is the golden liquid returning elixir.\nIt is wrought within one’s own body,\nwaiting until the tenth month is full\nbefore the embryo can shed its shell and become a sage.\n\nObserving the inner and outer medicines,\nthe harmonizing of the elixir head,\nand the methods of their function—\nthough roughly similar,\nin their application and firing times,\nthey are truly far apart.\nWhen we begin our practice,\nat the moment the inner and outer elixir heads harmonize,\nwe must guard against danger and consider risk,\nnot deviating by even a hair’s breadth.\nBe reverent, be reverent.\n\nWithin, there is the natural true fire,\nin the crucible, a blazing, enduring red.\nThe outer furnace requires diligent effort in increase and decrease—\nnothing surpasses the wondrousness of the true seed.\nThough the inner medicine possesses the true fire within the earthen crucible,\nblazing enduringly red,\nif it does not rely on the outer furnace’s diligent effort,\nadjusting and reducing its operation without error,\nit may yet avoid peril.\nYet the endless transformations of the inner and outer true fires\ntruly depend on the marvel of the true lead.\nThis treasure alone can capture mercury,\npreventing its flight.\nSome, not understanding this principle,\nclaim that the inner medicine is refined by true fire,\nwhile the outer medicine relies on ordinary fire for increase and decrease—\nlike peering at the sky through a tube,\nworthy of a laugh.\nLittle do they know that though inner and outer differ,\ntheir function is the same—\nthe Dao is not two.\n\nWhat is called inner and outer?\nA person’s body is endowed with the essence of heaven and earth,\nentrusted to yin and yang’s forging to take form.\nThus, within a single form,\nessence, qi, and spirit are the foundation.\nSpirit is born of qi,\nqi is born of essence,\nessence is born of spirit.\nYet these three are the one qi of post-heaven,\nthe most yin of things.\nIf a cultivator of the true clings to this body for refinement,\nthey work with nothing more than essence, qi, and spirit.\nAlas, these three are one,\nall born of post-heaven,\npure yin without yang—\nhow could they transcend the things of heaven and earth?\nThus, the Immortal Elder says: refining this alone only exhausts and weakens.\n\nMaster Zhongli says:\nTears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and marrow—\nthese seven have always belonged to yin.\nHe also says:\nRefining a single thing is solitary yin.\nTrue Unity Master says:\nSolitary yin cannot generate on its own.\nThe *Triple Concordance* says:\nA hen laying eggs alone—\nher chicks are never whole.\n\nThe sages knew that the qi of their own bodies,\nborn after heaven and earth,\nbelonged to yin things,\ndifficult to capture and easy to lose.\nThus, they gathered the pre-heaven one qi,\nwith the true yin and true yang of the two eights—\nkindred things—\ncapturing them within a single hour,\nrefining them into a grain of utmost yang elixir,\ncalled true lead.\nWrought externally, it is called the outer medicine.\nWith the yang elixir, one captures one’s own yin mercury,\nlike a cat seizing a mouse.\nThe yang elixir is the mother-qi of heaven and earth,\none’s own mercury is the child-qi of heaven and earth.\nUsing the mother-qi to subdue the child-qi—\nis this not of the same kind?\n\nThis workings take place within, hence it is called the inner medicine.\nThe Immortal Elder says:\nOnly when medicine meets its kindred qi does form arise;\nOnly when the Way accords with the subtle and formless does it become natural.\n\nTrue Unity Master says:\nBefore heaven and earth emerged from primordial chaos,\ntrue lead was born of the One,\ngradually giving rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases.\nThe *Triple Concordance* says:\nBorn before heaven and earth,\nmajestic and supremely venerable.\nAll these attest to the primordial one qi of the golden elixir.\n\nUsing the primordial yang elixir to refine one’s own yin mercury,\nit is transformed into pure yang.\nFurther aided by yin and yang, tally and fire,\nthrough the practices of withdrawal and addition,\nafter ten months the work is complete:\nform is transmuted into qi,\nqi into spirit,\nspirit merges with the Dao,\nascending into the formless,\nits transformations unfathomable.\nThus it transcends heaven and earth,\nstands beyond creation,\ngrasps and molds heaven and earth, yin and yang,\nyet is not molded by them—\nall through the power of the primordial one qi.\nIts marvel is such,\nhence it is called the peerless true seed.\n\nHow could the utmost yin of post-heaven things serve as inner medicine?\nHow could post-heaven vulgar cinnabar, vulgar mercury, vulgar fire, vulgar water—\nimpure substances of disparate kind—\nserve as outer medicine?\n\nThose who study the Dao must delve into the origin,\nrejecting delusive teachings,\nlest they forever fall into the three lower realms.\n\nSeven returns: cinnabar returns to its root.\nNine reversions: golden liquid returns to truth.\nDo not mistake the reckoning of *yin* and *zi* for *kun* and *shen*;\nsimply observe the standard of the five phases’ completion.\n\nThe nine reversions and seven returns\nare none other than the generative numbers of heaven and earth and the five phases.\nHeaven-one generates water, earth-six completes it.\nWater resides in the north,\naccumulating the true qi of *kan* yin,\nforming true water—\nhence it is said to “reside in six.”\nEarth-two generates fire, heaven-seven completes it.\nFire returns to the south,\nnurturing the true qi of *li* yang,\nforming true cinnabar—\nhence “seven returns: cinnabar returns to its root.”\nHeaven-three generates wood, earth-eight completes it.\nWood returns to the east,\nsettling in the *zhen* position as mercury—\nhence “eight returns.”\nEarth-four generates metal, heaven-nine completes it.\nMetal returns to the west,\ntransforming in *dui* as lead—\nhence “nine reversions: the golden body returns to truth.”\nHeaven-five generates earth, earth-ten completes it.\nEarth resides in the center,\ntransforming into the elixir.\nThus we know the golden elixir is formed from nothing but metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—\nhence “simply observe the standard of the five phases’ completion.”\nHow could the reckoning of *yin* and *zi* for *kun* and *shen*\nbe the nine reversions and seven returns?\n\nIt is but a single taste of mercury,\ncirculating,\npassing through all the celestial stems.\nWhen yin and yang qi are full, it naturally becomes spiritually efficacious—\nits ingress and egress never leave the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe true one’s water,\ncongeals to form essence.\nEssence is mercury.\nThe true one’s qi first transforms into water in the north,\nthen into cinnabar in the south,\nthen into mercury in the east,\nthen into metal in the west,\nand finally into the elixir in the center.\nThe elixir is not born without heaven and earth,\nnot produced without sun and moon,\nnot perfected without the four seasons,\nnot ripened without the five phases,\nnot completed without the total number.\nThus it traverses all the celestial stems,\nand when the numbers of yin and yang are full,\nit naturally transforms and becomes spiritually efficacious.\nYet its marvelous workings and transformations,\nits ingress and egress,\nnever depart from the two gates of the Mysterious Female—\ntruly the root of heaven and earth.\n\nIf you wish true lead to retain mercury,\nthe intimate must never part from the household minister.\nWood and metal, though separated, cannot meet without cause—\nthey must rely on the matchmaker’s allure.\n\nWood’s nature loves metal’s righteous compliance,\nmetal’s disposition yearns for wood’s benevolent kindness.\nThey devour and yet cherish each other,\nonly then is there conception within the void.\nThis speaks of the inner image.\n\nThe household minister is one’s own true qi.\nOne’s true qi first congeals through true metal,\nwhile the golden elixir only gains its spiritual efficacy through one’s own mercury.\nThe two substances are mutually necessary,\ntheir natures yearning for each other,\nonly then can they transform and become spiritually efficacious.\nHence it is said:\nIf you wish true lead to retain mercury,\nthe intimate must never part from the household minister.\n\nLead and elixir belong to metal and thus are external,\nwhile one’s own mercury belongs to wood and thus is internal.\nThe two are separated,\nunable to meet without cause—\nentirely dependent on the Yellow Dame to forge the elixir.\nOnce ingested into the abdomen,\nit pairs with one’s own mercury,\nrequiring the Yellow Dame’s allure.\nOnce the two natures are matched,\nthey unite in the field of yin tally and fire.\nThus wood’s nature loves metal’s righteous compliance,\nand metal’s disposition yearns for wood’s benevolent kindness.\nThe inner and outer metal and wood,\ntheir indolent natures devouring and yet cherishing each other,\nbecome husband and wife,\nnurturing the infant within my abdomen—\nonly then is there conception within the void.\nThis is the marvel of the Dao.\n\nThe White Tiger’s first meridian is the supreme treasure,\nthe Flowery Pond’s divine water is true gold.\nThus we know the source of supreme goodness runs deep—\nnot to be compared with ordinary medicinal substances.\n\nThe White Tiger’s first meridian is the qi of the first crescent moon,\nnot the celestial waters of women.\nTo slander the supreme Dao with the twenty-four grades of the Three Peaks\nis to defame the Dao—\ncan the Dao be defamed?\nThe nine heavens cannot be ascended by mere steps.\n\nThe true one’s qi in heaven is called the one water,\nin the tiger it is called the first crescent,\nand when refined and nurtured in the Flowery Pond it is called divine water—\nthis is the supreme treasure of true gold.\nIt never departs from the essence of the true one,\nflowing through all places,\nassuming various names yet capable of creation.\nThe classic says:\nThe highest goodness is like water.\nFor the true one’s water is born before heaven and earth—\nhence it is called the highest goodness.\nIts beneficial source runs deep and far,\nunlike the impure medicinal substances born after heaven and earth.\n\nIf you wish to complete the nine revolutions,\nfirst refine the self and hold the mind.\nFollow the time to gather and refine the floating and sinking,\nadvancing the fire while guarding against grave danger.\n\nThe nine revolutions are nine years.\nAfter the ten-month gestation,\nlike Bodhidharma facing the wall,\nembracing the One and practicing non-action,\none’s form and spirit both become wondrous,\nmerging with the Dao in truth—\nthis is called the great return of the nine-revolved golden liquid.\nBodhidharma’s return to the West with a single sandal\nis its verification.\n\nTo achieve the nine revolutions, one must first devote ten months of effort, returning the fire to refine the self, holding the mind in accordance with the time, and circulating the fire. Guard it carefully to prevent danger, probe and adjust, extract and replenish, to stabilize the floating and sinking, and distinguish host from guest. Remain receptive and not assertive, only then can peril be avoided. Thus, the form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness, transcending into formlessness.\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is the root of the Dao; the tortoise and serpent naturally embody it. The toad and crow meet at the new moon in harmonious union, the two qi mutually supporting and revolving. All is the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—who can fathom this profound abyss? When yin and yang are blocked and separated, fault arises; how then can heaven endure and earth last long?\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl unite once a year; the Greater Yin and Greater Yang conjoin once a month. The tortoise and serpent coil together in mutual support—all these are the workings of the two qi of yin and yang, the very root of the true Dao. The workings of the great elixir of golden cinnabar are no different. For the true One’s qi is formless and subtle; without the union of the two and eight qi of yin and yang, how could it manifest in the shape of a millet grain? After obtaining the elixir, without the steaming fusion of yin and yang’s symbolic fire, how could the golden liquid return as the elixir?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Guan guan go the ospreys,\nOn the islet in the river.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—\nFor her the gentleman longs.\"*\nThe male does not dwell alone, nor the female reside in solitude. The Dark Warrior’s tortoise and serpent coil together, illustrating that the female and male inherently require each other—this is the principle, what doubt remains? All is the subtle mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s workings, the Dao of creation—who can fathom this profound abyss and reverse the course of cultivation, holding the cosmos in hand?\n\nTrue One Master says: *\"Solitary yin cannot generate itself; solitary yang cannot complete itself. Only through the union of female and male qi can the Dao of embryonic transformation arise.\"* That Heaven and Earth endure long is due to the natural Dao of yin-yang union. If heavenly qi does not descend and earthly qi does not rise, the four seasons lose their order, and the myriad things fail to grow. From this, we see that when yin and yang are blocked, fault arises—how then can Heaven and Earth endure?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\"* The immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter; those deeply versed in this Dao should grasp its meaning with intuition.\n\nThis medicine is most sacred and divine—alas, your allotted share is too meager to consume it. Harmonizing lead and mercury takes less than a morning; soon the germ of the mysterious pearl appears. If a person of great virtue can cultivate it, why not dwell in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the medicine not distant—yet speaking of it makes all break into laughter.\n\nOnce the golden elixir enters the mouth, one ascends to the realm of sages—is this not most sacred and divine? Forged in less than half an hour, the golden elixir immediately manifests its form—is this not most simple and easy? Thus, speaking of it makes one unaware.\n\nThose who attain it fear only that their hidden virtue is too thin to propagate the Dao—this is truly difficult. Without discerning the five phases and four images, how can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? Unversed in the firing times of elixir refinement, one prematurely claims reclusion. Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors, one instead teaches mistaken paths to others, leading them astray into eternal delusion—how can such deceit be borne?\n\nThough there are ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures, the wonder lies in the *Cantong Qi*’s three characters. The chapter *\"Song of the Crucible\"* is the marrow of the elixir. Yet the world’s students of this Dao fail to comprehend—why do they not reflect deeply? Test this song against my own attainment; if it remains unclear, my understanding is still imperfect.\n\nWhy be deluded by the heterodox and the unrefined? Today’s scholars, failing to grasp the method of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, prematurely indulge in flights of cloud-walking and mist-dancing. They exalt themselves as models for others, yet remain unrepentant of their own ignorance, leading others into the depths of delusion—how can they bear a lifetime of such deceit, clinging to their wooden tablets in false contentment?\n\nWhose is the maiden of two eights? Where dwells the gentleman of nine threes? Claiming to be \"wood-fluid\" and \"metal-essence,\" when they meet earth, the three natures coalesce. Two eights is the yin number; the maiden is my true qi, also called wood-fluid. Nine threes is the yang number; the gentleman is the yang elixir, also called metal-essence. When these two substances unite in the earthen crucible of the cinnabar field, the three natures take form. Further refined by Master Ding’s forging, husband and wife at last embrace in joy. The river chariot dare not pause even for a moment, bearing its load to the summit of Kunlun’s peak. Master Ding is fire; the river chariot is water. Water and fire are the yin tally and yang fire. Day and night they revolve without cease, like a waterwheel endlessly turning by the riverbank. This speaks of lead and mercury within the earthen crucible, which must be tempered by fire so that the inner and outer couple may unite in joy. The yin tally and yang fire must never halt; the qi and firing times are borne from the Kunlun summit inward, warming and nurturing the sacred embryo, transmuting it into the pure yang golden liquid great elixir.\n\nWithin the male lies the female’s essence; embracing yin, it yet holds fast to yang’s essence. When these two harmonize, the medicine is complete—transmuting the po and refining the hun into sanctity. Trust in a single grain of the golden elixir: a serpent that swallows it transforms into a dragon, a chicken that consumes it becomes a phoenix. All ascend into the realm of true yang immortality. The male harbors the female—this is the dragon’s latent qi; embracing yin while holding yang—this is the tiger’s latent qi. When these two unite, the numinous elixir is born. Swallowed into the belly, it transmutes the yang hun to dissolve the yin po. A single grain, no larger than a millet seed, whether nurtured by chicken or devoured by serpent, likewise transforms into dragon or phoenix, soaring into the sacred realm of true yang—such is the sanctity of this medicine.\n\nHeaven and earth have just passed through closure and openness; dawn and dusk aptly employ the hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng*. Spokes converge at the hub as rivers flow to the sea—marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition. Before employing fire, the work begins with *Tun* and *Meng* and concludes with *Pi* and *Tai*. Day and night, the tally and fire are borne back to the crucible, like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, or the hundred rivers flowing to the sea. The marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.\n\nAttain the One, and all ten thousand things are complete. No need to divide east, west, south, or north. Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—life’s treasure must not be trifled with. The One is the essence of true unity. The qi of the One arises from yin and yang; yin and yang generate the four images, the four images generate the five phases, the five phases generate the ten thousand things—all emerge from the transformations of the One’s qi. Thus, the essence of the One is the cinnabar of heaven and earth, the ancestor of yin and yang, the progenitor of the four images, the root of the five phases, the foundation of the ten thousand things. Attain this One, and all is complete. East, west, south, and north are all the One. Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work, only then can the wonder of the One be fully realized. For the One’s image is manifested through the operation of yin and yang’s two fires. Having attained the One, swallow it into the five viscera, and as before, revolve the yin tally and yang fire—guard the prior work, hence the caution. Beware of peril, prevent danger, do not act rashly, lest the life-treasure, the mysterious pearl, be lost.\n\nAt winter solstice, the one yang returns; every thirty days, a yang line is added. By month’s end, the hexagram *Fu* reverts to *Shuo*; at full moon, the *Qian* culminates, and the omen of *Gou* appears. At winter solstice, the one yang is born, forming the hexagram *Fu*—a single yang line. After thirty days, it becomes *Lin*, with two yang lines. Another thirty days, *Tai*, with three yang lines. Another thirty days, *Dazhuang*, with four yang lines. Another thirty days, *Guai*, with five yang lines. Another thirty days, pure *Qian*, with six yang lines—this is the firing time of yang fire. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born; thus, at summer solstice, the one yin is born, forming the hexagram *Gou*—a single yin line. Likewise, every thirty days, a yin line is added: *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, *Bo*, and finally pure *Kun*—this is the tally of yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is reborn, cycling endlessly—such is the qi of a year. The sage transposes this yearly qi into a single month: the new moon’s dawn is *Fu*. Two and a half days correspond to thirty days; by the fifteenth day’s full moon, it is pure *Qian*—hence the moon’s fullness. The sixteenth day is *Gou*, the birth of one yin—thus, \"at full moon, *Qian* ends, and the omen of *Gou* appears.\" *Gou* foretells the initial stirrings of yin qi.\n\nThe day is further divided into cold and heat; yang is reborn at midnight, while at noon, the image of *Gou* brings the first yin of the day. In refining the medicine, one must know the twilight and dawn of yin and yang. The sage transposes the month’s qi into a single day, dividing it into the seasonal qi of cold, heat, warmth, and frost. Thus, the midnight hour of *Zi* is the birth of one yang, forming *Fu*; the noon hour of *Wu* is the birth of one yin, forming *Gou*. The operation of the yin tally and yang fire, the withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat—all must align with heaven and earth’s four seasons and the ascent and descent of yin and yang, without the slightest deviation. In refining the medicine, one must know the dawn and dusk of yin and yang’s inception.\n\nVirtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred; meritorious deeds accumulate to three thousand. Only when self and others, kin and foe, are equalized does one accord with the immortal’s original vow. Tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons cannot harm; the ghost of impermanence and bandits cannot entangle. Once the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to heaven, steadily riding the phoenix and simurgh’s chariot. Embracing the One for nine years, the work is complete, the Dao is achieved—self and others are both forgotten, form dissolves into the formless.\n\nWhen form has dissolved, how can blades, tigers, or rhinoceroses harm? The fire-house of impermanence—what can it entangle? Thus, one harmonizes light with the vulgar, saves and delivers sentient beings, reckons not self nor other, and embraces all with equanimity. Heaven bestows the treasure talisman, the body ascends to the azure vault—this is the moment when the true great man accomplishes world-transcending merit and fulfills his name.\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body; when refined, its transformations are boundless. Further, one investigates the true source in the nature, realizing the wondrous function of non-arising. Without awaiting another body in a future life, one sees before them the blessings of spiritual penetrations. Naturally, the dragon maiden bestows extraordinary merit—who thereafter can follow in such footsteps?\n\nThe immortal elder composed a scroll of elixir scriptures, fearing later generations would not believe, and further composed twelve *Xijiangyue* verses to clarify the meaning of the Western advent and to convey the purport of the Western return. How could one attain perfect clarity and awakening, yet still hear the supreme Dao?\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body; it delivers this colored body, which is itself the empty body. Emptying this illusory body, the jade talisman preserves the spirit, the golden liquid refines the form—form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. Who knows whether Bodhidharma came from the West for Wuzhen, or Wuzhen for Bodhidharma?\n\nThe middle scroll of *Wuzhenpian* commentary concludes here. (Here a character \"器\" was likely omitted; it has now been supplied.)\n\n**Commentary on the Lower Scroll of *Wuzhenpian***\n*Xiangchuan Wumingzi* Weng Yuanming annotates:\n\nThe lower scroll of *Wuzhen* was composed by Master Ziyang after reading the *Cantongqi*. Its discourse on the immortal’s embrace of the One refers to the sage’s refinement of fire until the work is complete, the body transformed into pure yang qi. Only then does one embrace the origin for nine years, enabling qi to become spirit and merge with the Dao in darkness—this is the meaning.\n\nThus it is said: the Dao is the root of nature; nature is the source of the heart-mind. Heart-mind and nature are of one substance, their transformations boundless. The common folk, not knowing, call it \"natural.\" If one can awaken to this, forgetting images and silencing the heart-mind’s speech, emptying the heart and filling the belly, embracing the One and transcending—after nine cycles of work, one attains immortality. This is its purport.\n\nThe \"nine cycles\" refer to nine years, the number of yang’s culmination. \"One\" is the strong name for the Dao. \"Embrace\" means embracing that which has nothing to embrace. At this juncture, the immortal discards the limbs, dulls brilliance, leaves the mundane world, equalizes self and other, without fixation, without divergence, without grasping, without rejection. Heart-mind and realm become one, free and at ease—thus attaining great stability and emitting celestial radiance. When the nine-year work is complete, the nature of non-doing is spontaneous, the formless spirit is wondrous. Transformations are boundless, concealment and manifestation unfathomable. When nature is rounded, wisdom illuminates the ten directions, spiritual communion is unimpeded—thus one can divide the body into a hundred billion, manifesting boundlessly, while the true essence remains quiescent and never acts. When form, nature, spirit, and life all unite and merge with the Dao in truth, this is called the immortal’s embrace of the One.\n\nIn ancient times, after the immortal elder attained the Dao, he demonstrated to his disciple Liu Fengzhen the entry into quiescence through non-arising. Having entered quiescence, he could yet manifest his true body on Wangwu Mountain—this is the same Dao. Long ago, Bodhidharma sat facing the wall for nine years; having entered quiescence, he could yet return to the West with a single sandal—this is it. Long ago, after the Tathāgata entered nirvana, he raised his golden coffin into the air and transformed it with the fire samādhi. After the body was consumed, moved by his mother’s ceaseless weeping, he could yet manifest his golden body in the air and speak half a verse—this too is the same Dao. Potalaka threw himself into the great flames, yet could release his body in the air. Such examples are too numerous to count. If not for the dual perfection of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit, who could achieve this?\n\nThus, the immortal elder concluded his scroll with Chan teachings on nature and Dao, which are not the same as the immortal’s embrace of the One. Therefore, I have divided it into three scrolls.\n\nThe Dao of nature is vast and boundless, silent and obscure, beyond speech or attainment. Humans and non-humans are all equal, without high or low. Yet since the beginningless beginning, among all things with form and name, not one lacks perfect completeness. For in its original spontaneity, purity, and tranquility, it is fully endowed—thus there has never been anything to say. Yet the great canon contains over five thousand scrolls; these are all those who, failing to taste the Dao, were compelled to speak. Later generations use words to clarify the Dao, but once the Dao is clear, all speech becomes false. Thus the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one claims the Tathāgata has spoken dharma, this is slandering the Buddha.\" Know that to speak is to slander.\n\nNow, the immortal elder’s songs on nature and Dao were also compelled by necessity. This is already excessive—thus I dare not add further superfluous commentary. I only wish that the fierce and brilliant may not seek from without, but awaken and clarify directly within their own hearts, shining forth uniquely, directly assuming and receiving the use, unconcerned with stillness or noise, speech or silence, taverns or brothels—whether so or not, all is equal, everywhere harmonious. The ten-direction world is but a single eye, a single body, wondrous functions free and unobstructed, pervading all directions, covering heaven and earth. There is no movement that is not true, no application that is not possible—thus one knows that here, originally pure and complete, nothing is lacking, and all reasoning ceases. Without questioning, without responding, without thought, without knowledge—even the word \"Buddha\" is no longer needed.\n\n**Reading the *Zhouyi Cantongqi***\nThe wondrous workings of the great elixir follow Qian and Kun;\nYin and yang move, the five phases divide.\nWhen the five phases flow in sequence, the common Dao has arising and ceasing;\nWhen the five phases reverse, the elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nQian and Kun are father and mother. They move the two qi of yin and yang, transform the five phases, and give birth to the myriad things. Thus, when yin and yang are molded in sequence, a human is formed. Therefore, within the human body, yin and yang are evenly balanced because form arises from yin and yang. Since form arises from yin and yang, there is birth and there is death. Yang governs life, yin governs death—one lives, one dies, one departs, one arrives: this is the natural principle of the common Dao in its sequential flow. The sage takes this as a model, reverses yin and yang, inverts the workings of creation, establishes Qian and Kun as the crucible, and steals the primordial unity of qi to make the elixir. With the elixir, one refines form to enter the formless, merging with the Dao in obscurity, becoming one with the Dao’s boundless nature. How could immortality have an end? Thus, it is eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nFrom the formless, substance is transformed; the Two Modes emerge from the One to establish the root. The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies; the Eight Trigrams mutually serve as ancestors and descendants. The myriad images arise from change and movement; fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse flourish here. The common people do not know this in their daily use, but the sage can fathom its fundamental root. Thus, the *Zhouyi* wondrously embodies the substance and function of creation, and so it entrusts its images to this text.\n\nThe formless is the substance of the Dao. The Dao generates the one qi, which then divides into yin and yang—thus, yang is heaven and yin is earth: these are the Two Modes. Heaven, with the one, generates water, residing in the north as winter. Earth, with the two, generates fire, residing in the south as summer. Heaven, with the three, generates wood, residing in the east as spring. Earth, with the four, generates metal, residing in the west as autumn. These form the four seasons, called the Four Images. Heaven is Qian, residing in *xu* and *hai*. Earth is Kun, residing in *wei* and *shen*. Kun seeks Qian and gives birth to three sons: the eldest is Zhen, residing in *mao*; the middle is Kan, residing in *zi*; the youngest is Gen, residing in *yin* and *chou*. Qian seeks Kun and gives birth to three daughters: the eldest is Xun, residing in *chen* and *si*; the middle is Li, residing in *wu*; the youngest is Dui, residing in *you*. Together, they form the Eight Trigrams, called the eight directions. Thus, from *zi* to *si* is the division of the yang realm, and from *wu* to *hai* is the division of the yin realm. As yin and yang revolve, the qi of the four seasons cycles through the eight directions, alternating in beginning and end, mutually serving as ancestors and descendants, thus generating transformation. Therefore, spring and summer are the qi of utmost yang, nurturing and growing the myriad things with virtue, which the myriad things receive with ease. Autumn and winter are the qi of utmost yin, disciplining and killing the myriad things with punishment, which the myriad things receive with distress. Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, the myriad images, the Eight Trigrams, the four seasons, yin and yang—all emerge from the one qi to give birth to the great Dao.\n\nThus, the great Dao and qi are the ancestors; the four seasons, yin and yang, the five phases, the Eight Trigrams, the myriad images, change and alteration, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—all are one body, present everywhere without exception. Therefore, though one sees and hears, speaks and appears, sleeps and tastes, moves and acts, encounters affairs, or engages in clamor, deception, or strangeness, there is nowhere the Dao is not. Thus, the Dao is within humans, yet humans do not know it; humans are within the Dao, yet the Dao is not diminished. Therefore, the common people use it daily yet remain unaware. The sage explores its mysteries, seeks its foundations, exhausts principle and fulfills nature to reach destiny, and thus can enact the wondrous workings of the Dao of the *Zhouyi*. Establishing Qian and Kun as the gates of the *Zhouyi*, once Qian and Kun are set, the Dao moves within them. Therefore, Qian and Kun seek each other to form the Eight Trigrams, and the Eight Trigrams mutually transform to become the sixty-four hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines: yang lines are odd, yin lines are even. Thus, one yang line, multiplied by four and nine, yields thirty-six counting rods; six yang lines together yield one hundred ninety-two lines—this is the counting of Qian. One yin line, multiplied by four and six, yields twenty-four counting rods; six yin lines together yield one hundred ninety-two lines. From the two chapters of Qian and Kun, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines, they combine to form eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods—this is the number of the Great Expansion of the Supreme Polarity, encompassing the Three Powers and containing the myriad images. Thus, the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, the omens of life and death, blessing and calamity—none can escape this number, and all can be examined here. Therefore, it is said that the wondrousness of the *Zhouyi* exhausts the substance and function of creation.\n\nMaster Wei observed that this Dao of the *Zhouyi* parallels the golden elixir, so he entrusted its images to compose the *Cantongqi* to clarify the aims of the great elixir, embedding his meaning within its words.\n\nWhen *Pi* and *Tai* interact, yin and yang either ascend or descend. When *Zhun* and *Meng* arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk. Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire; Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, hun and po. Guarding the center yields the primal auspiciousness of the Yellow Skirt; encountering excess leads to honor without position. Having not yet carefully considered the beginning and end of the myriad things, one again harmonizes the return and flight of the two qi. The waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence-spirit; the rising and setting of the sun align with the cold and warmth of construction and defense. The root establishes words to clarify images; once images are obtained, words are forgotten. Just as images are set to point to meaning, when meaning is grasped, all images are discarded. The enlightened seek simplicity and ease; the deluded become increasingly entangled in complexity. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth and read the *Cantongqi* should not cling to images or adhere to words.\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement do not extend beyond the two words: metal and fire. Metal is the golden elixir, also called true lead. Fire is the two qi of yin and yang, also called yin tally and yang fire. To refine the golden elixir, one first establishes true yin and true yang as the furnace and crucible, then lures the qi of the Supreme Polarity to form the elixir. The qi of the Supreme Polarity blends with the formless and cannot be sought or measured; if not enticed by true yin and true yang, it cannot descend in numinosity to take form. Thus, the *Cantongqi* establishes the two trigrams Qian and Kun as the furnace and crucible, divides the two trigrams Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, and places them in the central palace.\n\nThe remaining trigrams are distributed across the thirty days of a month to circulate the tally and fire.\n\nThus, Qian and Kun are the dragon and tiger, Zhen and Dui, husband and wife, hun and po. Kan and Li are lead and mercury, water and fire, the emotional and spiritual nature of man and woman. Extending this by analogy, the comparisons are without end. Yet when one seeks the most fitting expression, nothing surpasses the metaphor of the two substances: true yin and true yang.\n\nBy uniting these two substances and blending their qi within the central palace of the Yellow Path’s chamber, the elixir is refined—hence it is said, “Abiding in the center, the yellow skirt brings primordial auspiciousness.”\n\nOnce the elixir is obtained and ingested, only true fire can nurture the sacred embryo. Thus, the qi of primordial yang is mobilized as fire. Fire has no fixed position but circulates through the six voids—hence it is said, “When encountering *Kang*, it has no position yet is revered.”\n\nThe Heavenly One generates water, which in man is called essence. The Earthly Two generates fire, which in man is called spirit. A person’s essence and spirit, along with the *ying* and *wei* qi, constantly circulate throughout the body in unison with the qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the five phases.\n\nAt the winter solstice, the Earth’s single yang qi ascends, forming the *Fu* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi likewise rises—hence the advancement of yang fire. By the second month, the qi of yin and yang are evenly balanced, naturally intermingling to form the *Tai* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi follows the same pattern—thus the cessation of fire is called “bathing.”\n\nAt the summer solstice, the Heaven’s single yin qi descends, forming the *Gou* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi likewise descends—hence the advancement of the yin tally. By the eighth month, the qi of yin and yang are again evenly balanced, naturally intermingling to form the *Pi* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi follows the same pattern—thus the suspension of the tally is also called “bathing.” Hence it is said: “When *Pi* and *Tai* alternate, yin and yang either ascend or descend.”\n\nThe sage transposes the qi phases of a year into the thirty days of a month, calculating two and a half days per phase to correspond to a month. Thus, from the first day of the month onward, the first glimmer of the moon’s yin light appears, and the *Fu* hexagram governs. From the sixteenth day onward, the moon gradually wanes, and the *Gou* hexagram governs. By the twenty-third day, the moon is half diminished, metal and water equally divided, and the *Pi* hexagram governs. Hence it is said: “The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit.”\n\nFurthermore, the sage transposes the qi phases of a month into the twelve hours of a day. At the *zi* hour, a single yang arises—thus in man, a pure yang qi of essence ascends from the kidneys, advancing yang fire to form the *Fu* hexagram. At the *wu* hour, a single yin arises—thus in man, a supreme yin qi of spirit descends from the heart, advancing the yin tally to form the *Gou* hexagram. Hence it is said: “*Fu* and *Gou* illuminate the return and flight of the two qi.”\n\nThe sun’s rising marks day, its setting marks night. The sage mobilizes the tally and fire within a single day and night, distinguishing the qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, externally aligning with Heaven’s tally and internally harmonizing with the *ying* and *wei*, thereby regulating the body’s waxing and waning, drawing and replenishing, nurturing the child-pearl. Hence it is said: “The sun’s rising and setting correspond to the cold and warmth of the *ying* and *wei*.”\n\nAt the *zi* hour, yang fire is initiated—*zi* being the first of the six yang hours, thus the *Zhun* hexagram governs at dawn. Hence it is said: “When *Zhun* and *Meng* act, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk.” In one day and night, two hexagrams govern; in thirty days, sixty hexagrams are calculated. *Zhun* and *Meng* mark the beginning of the sixty hexagrams, while *Ji Ji* marks their end. Ending and beginning anew, beginning and ending again—hence it is said: “*Ji Ji* cautiously observes the end and beginning of the myriad things.”\n\nAll the above demonstrates how Master Wei made the Dao of the golden elixir utterly simple and effortless, with no need for elaborate exposition of secret teachings. Thus, he borrowed the imagery of the *Yijing*’s hexagrams to convey his meaning, enabling students to contemplate these symbolic forms and grasp their intent, thereby understanding his words.\n\nIf one attains the secret essentials of the golden elixir, then Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui, dragon and tiger, emotional nature and spirit, lead and mercury, water and fire—all such terms may be discarded. If one comprehends the true mechanism of firing, then the hexagrams *Zhun*, *Meng*, *Ji Ji*, *Fu*, *Gou*, *Pi*, *Tai*, and their lines and grains become superfluous.\n\nThis immortal elder, fearing that students reading the *Cantongqi* would fail to grasp Master Wei’s intent—clinging only to images and words while missing the meaning of “pointing to the image yet forgetting the words”—thus composed this to enlighten like-minded seekers. Such is his benevolence in aiding all beings.\n\nYet without the oral instructions of a true master, one cannot even approach a ten-thousandth part of the inner sanctum. *Commentary on the Wuzhen Pian, Scroll Three, Concluded*",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the *Awakening to Reality***\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Awakening to Reality*. Three fascicles. Originally attributed to Xiangchuan Wumingzi (Weng Yuanming), i.e., Weng Baoguang, of the Southern Song period. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Awakening to Reality***\n\nThe Master once said to me: The Perfected One of Tiantai Mountain, having attained the Dao, received from the Supreme Emperor the title \"Purple Yang Perfected.\" In silent service to the imperial house, he often concealed or revealed himself in the world, yet none recognized him.\n\nIn his youth, he studied alongside my ancestor at the Imperial Academy. Though he did not pass the examinations, he was endowed from birth with a numinous root. While perusing Buddhist scriptures, he suddenly experienced the awakening of the bamboo-striking insight, instantly realizing non-arising and directly transcending into the true emptiness of the pure and tranquil nature-ocean.\n\nIn his later years, he encountered the Elder of Qingcheng in Chengdu, from whom he fully grasped the profound principles of the Golden Elixir. He thoroughly understood the mechanism of yin-yang mutual interaction, the principle of heaven and earth’s inversion and generation, and thus was able to cultivate reality and restore life, ascending into formlessness. Embracing the One and illuminating the mind, he attained perfect emptiness and quiescence.\n\nThus, his form and spirit were both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. His transformations were boundless, manifesting universally throughout the dharma-realm. Through this marvelous function, he broadly delivered the deluded.\n\nEven now, those who encounter the Way of nature and life are truly rare.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, he propagated the Buddhist Dharma alongside Liu Fengzhen’s disciples. Before entering quiescence, he left behind a gatha on non-arising. After his disciples cremated his remains, they obtained hundreds of relics, some as large as jujubes.\n\nSeven years later, his disciples arrived at Wangwu Mountain and again met the Perfected One as before. This demonstrated his form and spirit both wondrous, the meaning of nature and life both complete.\n\nThe Perfected One harbored a nature of compassion and benevolence, magnanimous and forthright. He exhausted principle and fulfilled nature to reach life, unifying the Three Teachings without distinction in marvelous function. Unwilling to cultivate goodness solely for himself, he composed the *Awakening to Reality* to instruct later learners.\n\nFirst, he used the Way of immortals and life to entice their cultivation, thus beginning the work with verses on the Golden Elixir’s arts. Finally, he employed the true suchness of empty nature to dispel their illusions, concluding the volume with Chan poems.\n\nThe essentials of the Golden Elixir lie in establishing the furnace and cauldron with the true yin of the two eights and true yang. Drawing the primordial qi into this furnace and cauldron, it transforms into a grain as large as a millet seed, called the \"Great One Containing Reality.\"\n\nThus, he first composed fifteen seven-character quatrains to represent the number of the two eights’ true yin and true yang. One five-character poem represents the single grain of the Great One.\n\nAfter obtaining this grain and returning it to the cinnabar field, one then circulates the fire, following the sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams. Hence, he composed sixty-four quatrains corresponding to the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*.\n\nThe fire-circulation practice lasts ten months, with bathing periods totaling twelve months. He added twelve *Xijiangyue* poems to correspond to the annual cycle of the celestial revolution.\n\nWhen the ten months of practice are complete, the embryo is perfected and transforms into pure yang qi. Thus, he composed a total of eighty-one regulated verses, symbolizing the pure yang number of nine nines.\n\nAfter the form transforms into qi, one then embraces the Origin for nine years, refining qi into spirit, and merging spirit with the Dao. Thus, form and spirit become both wondrous.\n\nWondrous yet formless, spirit merges with the Dao, profound and unfathomable. Here, life and nature both reside in the ultimate source of emptiness and quiescence. Therefore, he concluded the volume with the Chan Way of nature.\n\nThus, the work first presents the great principles of the Golden Elixir in this sequence. The oral instructions on medicinal substances, fire phases, and secret formulas are all embedded within the verses; readers may seek understanding through the text.\n\nAfter its transmission spread widely, discrepancies and errors multiplied in the texts. Only the version preserved in the family of Lu Sicheng, grandson of the Duke of Longtu, is authentic—this being the edition personally transmitted by the Perfected One. The Perfected One also provided a detailed preface on his attainments at the end of the volume.\n\nWhile traveling through the grotto-heavens, I obtained this authentic text and corrected its errors. Only then did I comprehend the Perfected One’s intent in composing the work, its sequence of chapters, and its symbolic representation of the Golden Elixir’s methods.\n\nThough his words are concise, their principles are comprehensive; though his allusions are subtle, their analogies are intimate. Truly, this is the authentic guide for later learners and the essential compendium of the scriptural canon.\n\nNowadays, scholars often pursue heterodox and irrelevant paths to verification. Some recklessly misinterpret texts like *Celestial Court’s Supreme Treasure*, *Jade Flask Golden Elixir*, or *Primal Spirit Marvelous Elixir*, yet none attain the deep roots and firm foundation of true cultivation.\n\nThere was also Ye Wenshu, who used the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the Great Extension to explain and analyze the text. He appended diagrams at the end, calling it the *Outer Transmission of the Awakening to Reality*. This is like mistaking a curtain’s shadow for a horse or a screen’s silhouette for qian—trifling with the true scripture and increasing learners’ doubts.\n\nAlas! The Perfected One once said:\n*Not realizing one’s own errors,*\n*One teaches others the wrong path,*\n*Leading them astray in the sea of delusion for kalpas—*\n*How can such heartless deception be endured?*\nWas he not referring to Wenshu?\n\nHow could he know that a single grain of the Golden Elixir is the primordial qi of the Great Ultimate? The sage borrows the substances of the two eights, gathering their qi in a single moment to transform it into a grain. Ingesting it, one immediately ascends to sagehood.\n\nThe Perfected One said:\n*Within a single time-period, the elixir is complete.*\nAnd again:\n*Swallowing a grain of Golden Elixir,*\n*One realizes my life is not decreed by heaven.*\nHow could these be empty words?\n\nWenshu, failing to grasp this principle, mistakenly rejected the \"single moment.\" If it were not a single moment, would it not require three years or nine? Yet the Perfected One spoke of \"a brief moment’s effort yielding eternal ease and boundless joy.\"\n\nHe also misconstrued the \"single grain\" as a daily elixir, wrongly citing Zhenyizi’s saying of \"consuming one grain per day.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet if three years or nine were required, one would need to consume over a thousand grains—how could the Perfected One have deceived others with his words of \"a single moment\"? From these two points alone, it is clear that Wenshu failed to grasp the art of the Golden Elixir. Thus, his reckless annotations abound in errors, unaware that the numbers of the Great Ultimate and the *Dayan* are in fact the timing for firing and symbolic representation. To seek the supreme Dao of the Golden Elixir through symbols is like invoking rain by painting dragons or sating hunger with drawn cakes—how could it not be difficult?\n\nThough dull-witted, I follow the Perfected One’s footsteps. Having received the true response, I dare not forget it day or night. How could I sit idly by while red and purple distort the vermilion, unable to expand the Perfected One’s meaning and clarify it? Thus, unafraid of heavenly retribution, I boldly reveal the celestial mechanism. Faithfully adhering to my master’s secret instructions, I annotate the true text, dividing it into three volumes:\n\nThe **upper volume** speaks of the art of strengthening the army to conquer the belly, thereby harvesting the gold.\nThe **middle volume** expounds the method of enriching the nation and pacifying the people, thereby firing the furnace.\nThe **lower volume** reveals the Dao of the immortal embracing the One, thereby entering the primordial form.\n\nEach explains its practical matters without the slightest omission. For those of like mind, it will be clear and evident, directly verifying the supreme Dao without being misled by heterodox schools or crooked streams.\n\n**Preface by the Nameless One**\n\n**Annotations on the *Wuzhen Pian*, Volume One**\n*Commentary by Weng Yuanming of Xiangchuan*\n\nIn refining the Golden Elixir, one always begins at the first moment of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the first yang stirs. Seated firmly at the *kuigang* position, ascending three tiers of the altar, one grasps the Dragon on the left to stabilize the cauldron’s string and seizes the Tiger on the right to refine the qi’s timing. One civil, one martial, they contend and battle at the Mysterious Gate. One departing, one arriving, they fiercely struggle at the Gate of the Female. Breath aligns with the clepsydra’s marks, the count matches the celestial cycle—no deviation by a hair’s breadth, no regret over the slightest error. Thus, in a brief moment, three battles conclude, and the Elixir Pearl is instantly seized and ingested. Hence, it is called the art of strengthening the army to achieve victory.\n\nThe \"battle\" is the union; the \"army\" is the Dragon and Tiger. Obtaining the Golden Elixir within a single time-period is the art of conquering the belly. Thus, the *Western Florescence Scripture* states: *\"The ultimate victory of strengthening the army lies in the cultivation of the Mysterious Pearl.\"* Therefore, the Perfected One first presents twenty-eight seven-character verses to clarify the numbers of the Dragon and Tiger, and one five-character verse to signify obtaining a grain of Golden Elixir in a single time-period. This is why I have made it the upper volume—to elucidate the meaning of strengthening the army to achieve victory. The workings of harvesting the Golden Elixir are thus brilliantly clear.\n\n**Fifteen Quatrains in Seven-Character Verse**\n\nNot seeking the great Dao, one strays from the path—\nEven with worthy talent, how can one be a true man?\nA hundred years of light pass like a spark from stone,\nA lifetime’s existence floats like a bubble on water.\nChasing profit and rank for glory and display,\nOne disregards the body’s withering and decay.\nTry asking: can mountains of gold piled high\nEver buy back what is eternally gone?\n\nWhat men value most in the world is wealth and nobility—these are what all desire. Thus, people of the world exhaust their nature and destiny, fulfilling their lifelong ambitions, competing to pursue them with zeal. Observing their motivations, they are nothing more than indulgence in profit, rank, sensuality, and beauty—truly the spears and halberds that slay life, the shackles that bind the body. Why is this? Because worldly people, ignorant of the heart of virtue and power or the greatness of nature and destiny, only covet profit and rank, daily indulging in delusion, drowning in the river of love, adrift in the sea of desire. Right and wrong, self and others, wage war in their breasts; joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, ravage their bodies. Thus, corpse-demons shorten their years, cold and heat consume their complexion. Unaware, they live a fleeting life, like a flash on water’s edge; a hundred years of light pass in an instant, like a spark from stone. Even if one amasses gold by the bushel and jade by the mountain, when the time comes, can one buy back the body, preventing it from becoming a nest for ants? Alas! Before life’s end is announced, the spirit has already entered another shell. As the True Lord of Empty Serenity said: *\"Unenlightened in this life, one enters another shell, cycle after cycle, unaware.\"*\n\nAlas! Rather than casting oneself into a different species, why not abide in the great Dao? If the Dao is attained and the work completed, the body transcends the azure heavens, riding clouds and qi, driving flying dragons, roaming the boundless, forever unchanged in oneself, bearing the title of Perfected One—this is the season of a true man’s fulfillment, the day of utmost joy and glory. But those entangled in mundane affairs, their hearts mired in dust, falling into the world’s net—even with the worthy talent of Confucius and Mencius, or the splendor of Su and Zhang—are no more than wandering souls on earth, shadowy ghosts of walking corpses. How can they be called true men? Thus, the Perfected One first chants this poem, addressing those of exceptional insight, that they may awaken from a single word, swiftly seek the great Dao, escape the path of delusion, and engage in the work of non-action—only then is one a true man. All else is unworthy.\n\nThough man’s life may span a hundred years,\nLongevity or early death, success or failure—none can foreknow.\nYesterday, one rode through the streets on horseback;\nToday, one lies in a coffin as a sleeping corpse.\nWealth and wife are left behind, no longer yours;\nThe sins one carries will follow—who can deceive themselves?\n\nMan’s longevity or early death, success or failure, wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness—all are silently determined by one’s inherent allotment. How can they be measured or foreknown? Man’s lifespan is roughly a hundred years; even seventy is rare. With a fragile body of limited years, one toils endlessly after the boundless—is this not laborious? With a single breath gone, one departs forever, destination unknown. Is this not a great sorrow?",

      "translated_text": "Thus, one who but yesterday rode a horse through the streets may today lie as a sleeping corpse, with no certainty that the outgoing breath will return. At such a moment, though one may have held the highest rank, enjoyed ten thousand bushels of emolument, possessed priceless treasures, or kept a beauty who could topple cities—all must be cast aside, reduced to nothing, no longer one’s own. The only companion that cannot be deceived and must accompany one is the karma of sins committed in life. Hence the saying: “A thousand things will not go with you; only karma follows the body.”\n\nMaster Cao’s verse declares:\n*Alas, the toil and turmoil of human life—*\n*Like a burning house, the dusty world entangles day by day.*\n*Suddenly, the three-inch breath in the throat is cut,*\n*And spirit, soul, and consciousness scatter and dissolve.*\n*Though wife and children wail and plead in vain,*\n*A thousand cries, ten thousand calls—none will turn the head.*\n*No matter how shrewdly one schemes in life,*\n*Lying in the barren mound, the wise man is lost.*\nTruly, these are words of truth.\n\nThe great elixir is not sought in vain when encountered. For those who wish to escape the wheel of rebirth and not fall into the snares of the world, nothing surpasses the golden elixir of the great medicine as the sacred ladder to ascension and the swiftest path to transcendence. The Way is most simple and easy; even the dullest and most ignorant, if they practice it, may at once ascend to the rank of the sages. Yet the highest sages guard it in secrecy, forbidding careless disclosure. It is transmitted only through oral instructions to the worthy, never recorded in writing—thus, though difficult to encounter, it is easy to accomplish. Without diligent seeking and earnest resolve, with sincerity that moves the highest heavens, scarcely one or two have ever attained it.\n\nXie Ziran, longing for this Way’s rarity, yearned for a true master on Penglai. With utmost sincerity, he emptied his coffers, prepared a boat, and, heedless of the perilous waves and vast deeps, set forth without fear. Moved by his devotion, the sea god spoke: “The weak waters of Penglai stretch thirty thousand leagues; not even a mustard seed may float upon them. Where do you think to go?” He directed him instead to Master Sima Ziwei, who dwelt on Red City Mountain. Turning his boat, Xie sought out Red City and indeed found Ziwei, who transmitted the Way to him. After but a few years of cultivation, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. Ah! Sincerity issuing from within evokes response without—nothing is beyond reach. If one can set the heart and establish resolve thus, how can the Way of the golden elixir fail to be achieved? The Way does not betray man; man constantly betrays the Way.\n\nAs the *Cantong Qi* says:\n*The Way is neither distant nor near—*\n*It is entrusted only to the worthy.*\nWithout steadfast sincerity and ardent longing, how can one encounter it? To encounter it and not refine it is utter folly.\n\nThe secret essentials of the golden elixir are indeed hard to come by. Those who do encounter them possess innate immortal bones and the profound hidden virtue of their ancestors. Moreover, one must command great wealth and gather three companions to accomplish this principle. The enlightened know this well, though it is difficult to express. Thus, when Wang Chongzhao met Master Haichan and received the Way of the golden elixir, lacking the means to begin, he journeyed to Luoyang to seek the aid of Lords Han and Fu. With their support, he attained the Way and departed. If one encounters this Way and finds capable companions of one mind to cultivate together, yet refuses to act, such a one is truly the most foolish of fools.\n\nThe Immortal Elder’s poem to Master Liu says:\n*I hear you have known the medicine for many years—*\n*Why not gather your heart and refine the lead?*\n*Let not the candle be blown out by the wind,*\n*For in the six paths of rebirth, heaven cannot be blamed.*\nThese words speak truly.\n\nTo learn immortality, one must learn the immortality of heaven. Immortals are of several ranks: those whose yin spirits are most numinous yet formless are ghost immortals. Those who live in the world free from illness and sorrow, enjoying long life, are human immortals. Those who soar through the air and walk through mist, neither hungering nor thirsting, unharmed by cold or heat, roaming the sea isles and living forever without death, are earth immortals. Those whose form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth, who cast no shadow when walking in sun or moon, pass through metal and stone without hindrance, transform endlessly, now old, now young, now hidden, now manifest, now present, now gone—gathering to form a body, dispersing to become qi—whose depths the milfoil and tortoise cannot fathom, whose mysteries even spirits and gods cannot know, are heaven immortals.\n\nThus, Master Yin Zhen says: Those who can extinguish desire, cultivate embryonic breathing, move the spirit, shed the husk, enter samadhi, and cast off the corpse, relying on yin to be born without decay, are lower-grade immortals. Those who receive the talismans of the Three Armors, the covenant of the Great One, the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, or the arts of the sword and corpse-liberation, and thereby attain the Way, become immortals of the Southern Palace, dwelling in the various grotto-heavens as middle-grade immortals. Those who refine the great medicine of the golden elixir and attain the Way, ascending bodily to heaven, become the supreme, limitless, highest-grade heaven immortals.\n\nThe Immortal Elder exhorts those who cultivate the truth to establish a resolute and extraordinary resolve, sever all distracting thoughts, concentrate the spirit, and delight in non-action. Rejecting the lesser and middling immortals, they should aspire to realize the supreme, limitless, highest-grade heaven immortal. Only the golden elixir is the most authentic path.\n\nAmong the seventy-two grades of elixirs, the Way to learn heaven immortality is simple and easily accomplished—only the golden elixir, the supreme Way, is most authentic. This is the creation of something from nothing, not the later-born five metals, eight stones, cinnabar, mercury, black lead, white tin, yin and yang, arsenic, autumn stone, or herbs and trees of the world, nor the fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humors of the body—all of which are the creation of something from something. It is the primordial qi of the undifferentiated chaos before heaven. By methodically gathering and refining it within a single two-hour period, it coalesces into a grain the size of a millet seed, called the golden elixir, also known as true lead, yang elixir, true mercury, true unity essence, true unity water, water-fire, or the true qi of the Great One. When ingested, it instantly elevates one to the rank of the sages. This is the highest examination, the wondrous Way of heaven immortals, rarely heard of in the world.",

      "translated_text": "When the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil. The true unity qi emerges before heaven and earth, blending within the formless void—dim and indistinct, profound and obscure, invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing, untouchable by grasp. How then does it condense into a grain the size of a millet seed?\n\nThe sage gives form to the formless through the substantial, manifests the invisible through the visible. That which is substantial and takes form is true yin and true yang. These formless, kindred substances—void and nonexistent—are the primal qi of the crescent moon’s first phase, possessing qi yet lacking substance. When the two take shape in relation to one another, a single entity arises: this is the true unity qi, coalescing into a millet-seed pearl.\n\nAs the scripture says: *\"The primordial single treasure-pearl resides within the empty mystery, vast as a millet grain.\"* This is its proof. Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages used true yin and true yang as metaphors for the crescent qi of the Green Dragon and White Tiger, or likened them to true lead and true mercury.\n\nIn the verses of the immortals, the dragon is further named the Crimson Dragon, the Thunder Dragon, the Celestial Soul, the Qian House, the Qian Crucible, the Jade Tripod, the Fusang, the Jade Pool, the half-moon of the lower crescent, the Eastern Yang, the Eldest Son, the Vermilion Mercury, the Cinnabar Tripod, the Li Sun, the Scarlet Phoenix—all variations of the Green Dragon’s single name. The tiger is likewise called the Black Tiger, the Dui Tiger, the Earthly Soul, the Kun Position, the Kun Tripod, the Metal Tripod, the Metal Crucible, the Hua Peak, the half-moon of the first crescent, the Western River, the Youngest Daughter, the Black Lead, the Crescent-Moon Crucible, the Kan Moon, the Black Tortoise—all variations of the White Tiger’s single name.\n\nThe dragon’s crescent qi is named the Alchemical Maiden, the Wood Mercury, the Azure Maiden, the Vermilion-Ensheathed Mercury, Emotion, the Yellow Sprout, the Flowing Pearl, the Green-Clad Maiden, the Golden Crow, the Li Maiden, the Female Dragon, the True Fire, the Sixteen-Year-Old Alchemical Maiden, the Jade Mushroom, the Wood Fluid—all one and the same. The tiger’s crescent qi is called True Lead, the Metal Duke, the Metal Essence, the Metal in Water, the Silver in Water, Nature, the Golden Flower, the White Snow, the White-Clad Gentleman, the Talisman Water, the Nine-Three Gentleman, the Jade Hare, the Kan Son, the Male Tiger, the Knife-Tip—all one and the same.\n\nWhen the two substances meet and nature and emotion unite, these two substances are the dragon and tiger. The Green Dragon in the east belongs to wood, which engenders fire; the dragon’s crescent qi, as fire, is Emotion, belonging to the south, called the Vermilion Bird. The White Tiger in the west belongs to metal, which engenders water; the tiger’s crescent qi, as water, is Nature, belonging to the north, called the Dark Warrior. Dragon-wood, tiger-metal, nature-water, and emotion-fire constitute the four images, gathering at the central palace to return their merit to wu and ji, thereby forming the elixir. The elixir is earth. These are the true five phases, hence it is said: *\"When the two substances meet, nature and emotion unite; where the five phases are complete, tiger and dragon coil.\"*\n\nOriginally, with wu and ji as the matchmakers, husband and wife are thus made to harmoniously unite. The Wood Dragon in the east and the Metal Tiger in the west are separated—how can they be made to unite and generate transformation? The matchmaker is the Yellow Dame. Only by driving the dragon with the left hand and steering the tiger with the right can they be made to merge. The dragon and tiger, east and west, are brought together by the Yellow Dame; without her matchmaking, how could they be joined as husband and wife in joyful union?\n\nNow, when the true unity qi is stirred and coalesces into the golden liquid returning elixir, this is truly the image of the external medicine. Only after the work is accomplished and one ascends to the Jade Palace, enveloped in ninefold radiance, does one ride the auspicious simurgh. After ingesting this golden elixir, there remains the labor of ten months to refine form into qi, followed by nine years of embracing the one to transform qi into spirit. When both form and spirit attain perfection and merge with the Dao in truth, one rides the simurgh and crane through the ninefold radiance to ascend and pay homage at the Jade Palace.\n\nThis method is true within the true, wondrous beyond wonder—all because I alone differ from others. This Way is most divine, most sagely, most simple, most easy, most noble, most exalted, profound beyond profundity, wondrous beyond wonder, rarely heard of in the world. The immortal transcends his kind, rises above the multitude, and alone grasps its profound meaning.\n\nImmortal Chongzhao said: *\"Of all the Daoists in the world, none can be commended for the Way of the Golden Elixir—only Pingshu alone.\"* He is Mount Tai, the river and sea; how dare the mere streams and puddles presume to compare?\n\nKnowing that inversion arises from li and kan, who recognizes the floating and sinking to determine host and guest? Li is yang and resides in the south, yet is called female—outwardly yang but inwardly yin—termed true mercury. Kan is yin and resides in the north, yet is called male—outwardly yin but inwardly yang—termed true lead.\n\nThe immortal said: *\"The sun dwells in the li position yet is called female; the moon pairs with the toad palace yet is male. If you do not grasp the meaning of this inversion, do not presume to discourse on such lofty matters with shallow understanding.\"* This speaks of kan’s male and li’s female, like the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the sun’s crow and the moon’s hare, mercury within cinnabar and silver within lead. It also refers to heaven’s Yellow Son and earth’s Dark Maiden. All these point to the crescent qi of the first phase.\n\nHost and guest: yang, noble and elevated, resides on the left as the host; yin, humble and low, resides on the right as the guest. Li is fire, which flames upward, sharing wood’s nature of floating—both belong to yang, hence the host. Kan is water, which moistens downward, sharing metal’s nature of sinking—both belong to yin, hence the guest.",

When ingested, it instantly elevates one to the rank of the sages. This is the highest examination, the wondrous Way of heaven immortals, rarely heard of in the world.",

      "translated_text": "This is the natural order of the common Dao. Yet now li is reversed to become female, kan reversed to become male; the host is reversed to become the guest, and the guest reversed to become the host—is this not inversion? Thus it is said: *\"Only when one knows inversion through li and kan / Who discerns floating and sinking to fix host and guest?\"*\n\nTo fix host and guest is to take the crescent qi of the two phases as the inverted host and guest, not the host and guest of the common Dao—hence they are called host and guest.\n\nThe golden crucible seeks to retain cinnabar-wrapped mercury,\nThe jade pool first descends with silver in water.\nThe golden crucible: gold is a yin substance, yet within the crucible resides yang qi—this is the image of yin containing yang, the White Tiger. The jade pool: jade is a yang substance, yet within the pool resides yin qi—this is the image of yang containing yin, the Green Dragon. Mercury within cinnabar is the crescent qi of the dragon.\n\nIf the cultivator of the elixir wishes to use the tiger to retain the dragon’s qi, they must first drive the dragon to the tiger. Only then will the two qi intertwine, their natures harmonizing. Through refinement and firing, the true essence of the One naturally congeals.\n\nFire, moreover, is the untransmitted marvel of the sages. At its highest, it reaches eighty-four thousand *li*; at its lowest, it stirs even in the depths of the North Pole’s great abyss. When kindled, it becomes fire—thus the sage uses it to complete the elixir, while the fool invites disaster.\n\nThe divine work of firing does not last the whole morning—\nA single wheel of sun emerges from the deep pool.\nFire here refers to the crescent qi of the two phases, the beginning of a day. *Zi* is the origin of the six yangs, hence called \"morning\" or \"sun at *zi*.\" When the sage moves the elixir-fire with divine skill, in less than half an hour, the true essence of the One is obtained—a grain like millet, appearing in the Northern Sea, its light piercing the curtains, like a single blazing sun rising from the deep pool. It is not the whole morning, for within one hour, the golden elixir is instantly achieved. This describes the external medicine’s symbolic form.\n\nThe tiger leaps, the dragon soars—waves surge, winds roar;\nAt the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.\nFruit ripens on the branch in due time,\nThe child in the womb—how could it be different?\n\nThis verse speaks of the true essence of the One, whose creation lies outside—called the golden elixir, true lead, or true earth. When swallowed into the five viscera, it becomes the yang elixir. Here, the tiger is the golden elixir. The dragon is one’s true qi. The wind and waves are the qi surging from the primordial sea, its turbulence like waves, its motion like wind. The \"central true position\" is the golden womb’s divine chamber within the elixir, where the elixir coalesces. The Mysterious Pearl is the infant, also called the golden liquid returning elixir.\n\nThe golden elixir is formed from the primordial chaos before heaven and earth, thus it is the mother, the sovereign, the lead—called the tiger. One’s true qi, born after heaven and earth, is the child, the minister, the mercury—called the dragon. When the golden elixir enters from without and is swallowed into the abdomen, one’s true qi rises from the lower sea of qi like wind and waves, converging eagerly—like a minister attending the sovereign, a child longing for its mother. Their mutual affinity is evident. When dragon and tiger unite in the divine chamber’s earthen cauldron, the sacred embryo forms—no different from fruit ripening on the branch or a child in the womb. After ten months, the embryo matures, and the spirit naturally emerges through transformation.\n\nThe Southern and Northern lineages reverse the hexagrams’ images;\nMorning and evening firing align with the celestial pivot.\n\"South and North\" refer to the *zi* and *wu* hours; \"lineage source\" means the critical beginning. \"Morning and evening\" pertain to the principles of day and night. *Zi* is the head of the six yangs, hence \"morning,\" corresponding to the *Zhun* hexagram’s duty—this is the time for advancing fire. *Wu* is the source of the six yins, hence \"evening,\" corresponding to the *Meng* hexagram’s duty—this is the time for advancing water. Each day, two hexagrams govern their duties, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng*, ending with *Jiji* and *Wei*, cycling endlessly—hence \"reversing the hexagrams’ images.\"\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: *\"At dawn, *Zhun* governs its duty; by dusk, *Meng* takes its turn. Day and night each have one hexagram, used in proper sequence. From *Jiji* to *Wei* at dusk, the end returns to a new beginning.\"*\n\nEach day, two hexagrams govern their duties, along with the four hexagrams of the male and female, totaling sixty-four hexagrams in a month. Each hexagram has six lines, so sixty-four hexagrams comprise three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the days of a year including intercalary months. *Qian*’s first nine begins with *Kun*’s first six; *Qian*’s count is thirty-six, so six lines total two hundred sixteen. *Kun*’s first six begins with *Qian*’s first nine; *Kun*’s count is twenty-four, so six lines total one hundred forty-four. Together, they sum to three hundred sixty, the degrees of a celestial cycle.\n\nThe movements of the sun and moon—conjunction, ascent, descent—do not exceed the bounds of the hexagrams’ lines. The moon moves swiftly, completing one celestial cycle in a month. The sun moves slowly, completing one cycle in a year. The \"celestial pivot\" is the pivot of the Dipper. Each day and night, it completes one cycle, shifting position once a month. For example, the first month aligns with *yin*, the second with *mao*.\n\nTake the first month aligning with *yin*: if the sun has not yet passed the official division, *yin* is placed over *hai*, reaching *you* to find *zi*—this is the first month, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to *you*, marking the true *zi* hour. If the sun has passed the official division, *yin* is placed over *xu*, reaching *yin* to find *wu*—this is the first month, with the Dipper’s handle pointing to *yin*, marking the true *wu* hour.\n\nThe superior adept, the perfected person, understands the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the ascent and descent of yin and yang. They practice the *zi-wu* firing with day and night, adjusting numbers according to the Dipper’s position, naturally aligning with celestial degrees—hence \"aligning with the celestial pivot.\" The marvel of the supreme Dao lies herein.\n\nOne must know that great reclusion resides in the marketplace;\nDo not seek solitude in the deep mountains.",

      "translated_text": "The great elixir of golden cinnabar is possessed by every household, unbound by marketplace or court. Yet how many recognize the dragon when they see it, or the tiger when they meet it? How few reverse their practice to cultivate it! In but a moment, a precious pearl coalesces, large as a grain of millet. Held in the palm, it radiates iridescent light. Swallowed into the belly, the jeweled palace is renewed.\n\nThe great Dao hides in the marketplace—those in the mountains know not. How could those of solitary yin and scant yang ever grasp this Way? The yellow sprout and white snow are not hard to find; the enlightened must rely on deep virtue and conduct. The Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on earth: the dragon’s latent *qi* is called the yellow sprout, the tiger’s latent *qi* is called the white snow. The root of the great elixir truly lies here.\n\nThe Way is most simple, the matter not distant. Yet without great merit and mighty deeds, none may encounter a true master to transmit its profound essentials. This origin begins in emptiness and gives birth to the One *qi*; the One *qi* transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. The dragon, wood, engenders fire; the tiger, metal, engenders water—wood, fire, water, metal: these are the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols unite to form the elixir, and the elixir’s completion depends on earth. Earth has no fixed form; it divides its position among the four directions and four seasons. Without earth of the four seasons, the four sequences do not proceed, and the myriad things do not arise. Thus the Four Symbols and Five Phases all depend on earth.\n\nHow could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from *ren*? *Ren* is water, the true One *qi*. The true One *qi* is the true One water, born before heaven and earth, transforming into the yang dragon and yin tiger. When dragon and tiger unite, the elixir is formed. The elixir is earth; the dragon is wood; the tiger is metal. Metal, wood, and earth are called the Three Natures, and the Three Natures are the Three Origins. The Three Origins do not depart from the transformation of the true One water.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams: the One *qi* first transforms into heaven, called *qian*, the father. Next it transforms into earth, called *kun*, the mother. *Qian*, with its yang *qi*, seeks *kun*’s yin *qi*: at the first seeking, it gives birth to the eldest son, *zhen*; at the second seeking, the middle son, *kan*; at the third seeking, the youngest son, *gen*—this is *qian*’s yang *qi* uniting with *kun*’s *qi* to give birth to the three yang. Then *kun*, with its yin *qi*, seeks *qian*’s yang *qi*: at the first seeking, it gives birth to the eldest daughter, *xun*; at the second seeking, the middle daughter, *li*; at the third seeking, the youngest daughter, *dui*—this is *kun*’s *qi* uniting with *qian*’s *qi* to give birth to the three yin. These too do not depart from the transformation of the true One *qi*. Hence it is said: “How could the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams depart from *ren*?”\n\nNot only the Three Origins and Eight Trigrams do not depart from the true One *qi*. Since the opening of heaven and earth, all things with form and name arise from this and transform. The True One Master said: “The essence of the true One is the mother of heaven and earth, the root of yin and yang, the origin of water and fire, the ancestor of the sun and moon, the source of the Three Powers, and the progenitor of the Five Phases. The myriad things rely on it for birth and completion; the thousand spirits depend on it for joy and sorrow. As for the lofty heavens and profound earth, the grottoes and famous mountains, the mysterious images and numinous spirits, the immortals, buddhas, worthies, and sages, the winds and rains, the dark and bright moons, the spring, summer, autumn, and winter—before any sign appears, all arise from this leaden *qi* and transform.”\n\nFor those who cultivate the elixir, if they obtain the true One water, then all matters are complete. The refined numinous essence is hard for others to recognize; when all yin demons are dissolved, ghosts dare not approach. Swallowing the true One millet into the cinnabar field and circulating the fire for ten months burns away all the host of yin. The body transforms into a pure yang immortal, and the yin demons, corpse-ghosts, flee without refuge.\n\nShould one wish to leave secret formulas among humankind, none have met a *ziqi*—how could one find another like oneself? The yellow lead must be sought with intent; let not the days slip by in vain. Simply capture the earthly *po* to seize the vermilion mercury, and the celestial *hun* will naturally restrain the watery metal. This may be called: “When the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit”; it may be said: “When virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.”\n\nThe true lead is the golden elixir, the primordial One *qi*, akin to the bright moon, now full, now crescent, sharing its origin with the river tides and the lunar palace. The earthly *po* is the external medicine—the white tiger. The internal medicine is the golden elixir. The celestial *hun* is the external medicine—the green dragon. Internally, it is the body’s own vermilion mercury; externally, it is the dragon’s latent *qi*. Internally, it is the golden elixir, also called silver in water. This speaks of the internal and external medicines.\n\nWhen the sun has passed one’s fate, then life follows in extinction. We must seek a master with intent, swiftly refine the golden elixir, and transcend life and death. Simply capture the tiger’s soul, and the dragon will naturally restrain its *po*. The two *qi* swallow each other and produce the golden elixir. Once the golden elixir is obtained, use this elixir to capture one’s true mercury; the true mercury transforms the golden elixir and completes the sacred embryo.",

They practice the *zi-wu* firing with day and night, adjusting numbers according to the Dipper’s position, naturally aligning with celestial degrees—hence \"aligning with the celestial pivot.\" The marvel of the supreme Dao lies herein.\n\nOne must know that great reclusion resides in the marketplace;\nDo not seek solitude in the deep mountains.",

When the gods, spirits, ghosts, and *po* within the body are sanctified, the obstructive ghosts and stagnant spirits beyond the world bow in reverence. None but those of abundant Dao and flourishing virtue can achieve this.\n\nOnce you know your life spans as heaven and earth, afflictions can no longer arise in the heart. The body transforms into pure yang, its longevity matching heaven and earth, roaming beyond the mundane while dwelling freely in the world. All thoughts dissolved, afflictions cannot touch the heart.\n\nCease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits; seeking herbs and plants is even further from the truth. Yin and yang of the same kind return to mutual resonance; the two eights in balance naturally unite in affinity.\n\nThe Three Yellows, Four Spirits, minerals, metals, herbs, and plants are all post-celestial turbid substances—how could they transform the formed into the formless? Thus, the *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: \"External flesh cannot form the embryo; stitched flowers cannot bear fruit.\"\n\nThe qi of True Unity arises before heaven and earth, profound and unfathomable, beyond measure. Through the union of the two eights—substances of the same kind in perfect balance—they bind and intertwine in mutual resonance, stirred into manifestation.\n\n\"Same kind\" refers to the emotion within non-emotion, the color within non-color—like eight ounces of crow’s liver and half a catty of hare’s marrow.\n\nWhen the sun glows red at the bottom of the pool, yin demons vanish; when the moon shines white atop the mountain, the medicinal sprout is renewed.\n\nThe pool’s yin and the sun’s yang: the red sun at the pool’s bottom is yang within yin. Yang within yin is pure yang, devoid of yin qi, so yin demons perish—this is the tiger’s initial infant qi, called red lead. The white moon atop the mountain is yin within yang, the dragon’s initial latent qi, called black mercury.\n\nThe sage takes these two substances, refines them in a single hour into a grain of yang elixir, which coalesces in the Northern Sea, blazing like the sun, its light piercing the curtains. At once, it is drawn into the abdomen to ignite one’s yin mercury. The yin mercury—all the body’s yin and perverse qi—is entirely consumed, just as when the dawn sun rises from the Eastern Sea, its radiance dispels all demons.\n\nOne’s own yin mercury, from the summit of the lower peak of the cinnabar field, newly receives the qi of the yang elixir, gradually congealing and sprouting tenderly—hence the \"new medicinal sprout.\" Like the moon at the first crescent, exchanging light with the sun, it newly receives the sun’s qi at dusk, casting a faint glow on the western mountain’s *geng* peak, shaped like an eyebrow—its light tender, the medicinal sprout renewed. This allegory illustrates the imagery of the internal and external medicines.\n\nPeople of this age must recognize true lead and mercury—they are not common cinnabar or quicksilver. The *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: \"Yin within yang is called the Radiant Maiden; yang within yin is named the Golden Duke.\" These are the husband and wife within the crucible, the ladder to the Purple Palace.

      "translated_text": "The external true lead and true mercury are none other than the *qi* of the dragon and tiger at their first crescent. The internal true lead and true mercury are one’s own true *qi*, the golden elixir. Those of this age must recognize the authenticity of lead and mercury—these alone are real; all else is false. These two true substances can transform the corporeal into the incorporeal, becoming true immortals, for the lead and mercury of the mundane world cannot compare.\n\nNot knowing the inversion within the mysterious, how can one plant lotuses in fire? By human affairs, a man cannot conceive, nor can lotuses grow in fire. Yet the immortals possess the wondrous art of inversion, enabling a man to conceive, just as lotuses bloom in fire. Why? The *li* trigram is male, yet here it is female; the *kan* trigram is female, yet here it is male. This is the inversion. When these two are inverted, the elixir is born. Using the elixir to refine one’s own mercury into an infant is a man’s conception—is this not inversion? One who penetrates this principle plants lotuses in fire.\n\n\"Lead the White Tiger home to nurture,\nAnd bear a luminous pearl like the full moon.\"\n\nThe Green Dragon and White Tiger are both the essence of the true One, two things divided east and west, yet sharing the same origin under different names. The essence of the true One pertains to mercury; mercury is the dragon, dwelling in the east, so the essence of the true One resides in the east. The White Tiger is originally the child of the true One, born in the west but with its home in the east. The Immortal Elder said: *\"The Golden Duke is a child of the eastern house, sent to the western neighbor to be born. Recognize and call him home to nurture, match him with the Radiant Maiden in kinship.\"*\n\nThus, leading the White Tiger home to pair with the Green Dragon as husband and wife, they produce a luminous pearl, round like the moon. The method of elixir refinement begins by taking the half-moon at the western upper crescent, obtaining eight ounces of yang metal. Next, take the half-moon at the eastern lower crescent, obtaining half a pound of yin water. Combining these two half-moons’ *qi* gives birth to the elixir, round like the full moon. The *Fire Record of the Great Elixir* states: *\"A single grain of numinous elixir, large as a millet seed, weighs one pound.\"* These two eight-ounce measures combine into one pound, echoing the Immortal Elder’s meaning of the full moon—both metaphors for the imagery of the external medicine.\n\nOnce this elixir is swallowed, the golden elixir becomes the White Tiger. Lead this White Tiger into your abdomen, pair it with your own mercury, then circulate the yin tally and yang fire through the sixty-four hexagrams, refining it into the golden liquid returning elixir. A single grain also weighs one pound, round like the moon—this is the imagery of the internal medicine.\n\nThe internal medicine’s roundness like the moon arises from the fire-circulation hexagrams: each hexagram has six lines, sixty-four hexagrams total three hundred eighty-four lines, symbolizing one pound and three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. The external medicine’s roundness like the moon comes from the two half-moons of the upper and lower crescents’ eightfold numbers. The *Kinship of the Three* states: *\"The upper crescent *dui* is eight, the lower crescent *gen* is also eight; when the two crescents merge their essence, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete. Two eights make one pound, the Dao of Change stands firm.\"* True One said: *\"The upper and lower crescents form the number of one pound. The three hundred eighty-four lines correspond to the fire phases—this is the calculation of lines.\"*\n\nThe Immortal Elder’s indication of the full moon’s meaning is to make scholars thoroughly understand the principles of creation, distinguishing the internal and external eightfold numbers—they cannot be discussed indiscriminately.\n\nDo not idly guard the elixir furnace to watch the fire phase;\nSimply settle the spirit and rest the breath, letting nature take its course.\nWhen all yin is stripped away, the elixir matures,\nLeaping from the mortal cage to live ten thousand years.\n\nThe fire is not the common fire of the world but the primordial ancestral *qi* of original yin and yang. There is no elixir furnace to guard—this is merely a metaphor. Qingxiazi said: *\"The crucible is no metal crucible, the furnace no medicinal furnace. Fire arises from below *li*, water responds within *kan*. When the three natures unite, the two flavors naturally converge. The embryo is sealed without leakage, transformation occurs in an instant.\"*\n\nGao Xiangxian said: *\"Heaven and earth bind the union of man and woman; the four images and five phases interlock. Day and night alternate in *zhun* and *meng* by natural law—why laboriously watch the fire phase?\"* This speaks of the natural furnace fire, not the furnace fire of the world. Simply settle the spirit and regulate the breath, harmonizing civil and martial, timing the tally and clepsydra—do not err by even a fraction, and within half an hour, the elixir will be attained. Then, follow the timing to advance and retreat the yin tally and yang fire, applying the techniques of drawing and adding, guarding against danger. After ten months of work, all yin is stripped away, the body transforms into pure yang, leaping from the mortal cage—how could this be merely ten thousand years?\n\nThis is merely a rough outline; only here is the golden liquid returning elixir achieved, yet it has not yet entered the wondrous. Further embrace the One for nine years, returning *qi* to its root, unifying form and spirit in wondrous harmony, merging with the Dao in truth.\n\nTo know the source of the medicinal stream,\nIt lies only in the southwest—its native land.\nThe *Scripture of Western Florescence* states: *\"The medicine is born in the southwest, gathered in *wu* and *ji*; seize the moment, and the day to work arrives.\"*\n\nThe southwest is *kun*, the birthplace of the tiger. This direction is also where the moon rises, hence its native land. The moon is the crystal of metal and water; the upper and lower crescents’ metal and water merge *qi* to generate the medicine. The source of the medicinal material is the earth’s productive stream, truly issuing from the Mother *kun*.\n\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, hasten to gather;\nWhen metal meets the full moon’s distance, it is no longer fit to taste.\nWhen lead sees *gui* born, the moon is full. When metal meets the full moon’s distance, the moon wanes. Seizing or missing the moment depends on oral transmission—it lies in heart-to-heart instruction.",

      "translated_text": "An ancient poem says:\n*\"Count the breaths of the celestial cycle, tally each moment;\nThe jade clepsydra’s drips echo in perfect accord.\"*\nThis is the esoteric oral transmission passed from mouth to mouth.\n\nLu Sicheng, in his *Postface to the Awakening to Reality* as the Immortal Elder, noted that many who transmitted this poem misread *lead* as *if* and *metal* as *like*, gravely distorting the Immortal Elder’s profound intent. *Metal* and *lead* are none other than the Golden Elixir. On the *gui* day at the *zi* hour, one must work without delay—this is the moment to swiftly gather. If one waits until past the full moon, it is no longer fit to taste. This is the celestial mechanism, the oral transmission of the secret; it cannot be committed to writing. Master Lu revealed its threads to correct the errors of the foolish and ignorant. Yet he guarded its source, fearing its spread through written records. We who have received the mysterious instruction in person should understand it well. If not, it remains as unattainable as a pearl suspended five *zhang* above the earth—a millet-grain pearl not easily obtained.\n\nAlas, how many stray paths abound! Many mistake cinnabar for lead and gold, treating the gathering of *tian gui* as child’s play. Ye Wenshu’s talk of *kun* receiving *gui* is laughable. All these are the reckless fabrications of those who have never met a true master.\n\n*\"Return it to the earthen crucible, seal it tightly;\nNext, let the flowing pearl pair and match.\"*\n\nIngest the elixir into the Yellow Court’s earthen crucible, firmly sealing the embryo to prevent leakage. Circulate the fire, let the flowing pearl enter the mercury, and pair it with the embryo to coalesce into the numinous.\n\n*\"The medicine weighs one *jin* and requires two eights;\nHarmonize the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang.\"*\n\nEight ounces of crow’s liver, half a *jin* of hare’s marrow—two eights together make one *jin*, hence the medicine’s weight. The fire is not fire in truth but borrows the qi of yin and yang, harmonizing and applying it to succeed.\n\n*\"Though ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures speak alike,\nThe Golden Elixir alone is the root and origin.\nFollow the *kun* position to form the body;\nPlant it in the *qian* household’s Chamber of Mutual Resonance.\"*\n\nDo not wonder that the celestial mechanism has been fully revealed—it is only that scholars remain deluded. If one can grasp the poem’s meaning, one stands among the Three Pure Ones as a Supreme Lord.\n\nThe ten thousand scrolls of immortal scriptures all converge on one truth: the qi of the waxing crescent (two eights) is the essence of the Elixir. Simply follow the generative principle of the Mother *kun* and cultivate it in reverse. After obtaining the Elixir, plant it in the Father *qian*’s Chamber of Mutual Resonance to circulate the fire of the tally. The wonder of elixir refinement lies in nothing but the two words *lead* and *fire*. The Immortal Elder has here disclosed the entire celestial mechanism, yet scholars remain stubbornly deluded. Why not seek it within oneself to illuminate the Supreme Way, coalescing into a single millet-grain and ascending as a guest of the Emperor?\n\n*\"In plants and trees, yin and yang are equally paired;\nIf one is lacking, they will not flourish.\nFirst, the green leaves open as yang takes the lead;\nLater, the red flowers bloom as yin follows.\"*\n\nThis is the constant Way of daily use, yet who knows the true source’s return to the root? I say to all gentlemen who study the Dao: if you do not understand yin and yang, do not scoff in ignorance.\n\nBefore plants and trees sprout, they contain the purest essence. When their husks split, they receive the primal qi to germinate, thus sending forth a single stem to symbolize that qi. Next, they divide into two leaves to symbolize yin and yang. Then, from between the two leaves, they send forth a bud to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, branches proliferate, flowers and leaves flourish—spring’s green leaves arise, summer’s red flowers bloom, all through the agency of yang qi. Autumn’s solemnity yields fruit, winter’s desolation returns them to mulch, all through the agency of yin qi. When yin and yang are equally paired, transformation is ceaseless; if one is lacking, the myriad things cannot arise.\n\nMaster True Unity said: *\"Solitary yin does not grow on its own; solitary yang does not achieve completion.\"* Thus, heaven and earth embrace, and the myriad things transform into purity. Male and female unite in essence, and the myriad things are born. The common people take this as their daily constant Way, unaware of the wondrous principle of the true source—the mechanism of reversing yin and yang, their inverted mutual use—to transcend life and death. If scholars do not understand this and mock me, they merely reveal their own blindness.\n\n*\"Three, five, one—just these three words;\nFrom ancient times to now, those who truly understand are rare.\nEast’s three and south’s two together make five;\nNorth’s one and west’s four share the same.\"*\n\nThree, five, and one are none other than the dragon and tiger. The dragon pertains to wood, wood’s number is three, and it resides in the east. Wood generates fire, so the dragon’s crescent qi is fire. Fire’s number is two, and it resides in the south. The two things share a source, so three and two combine to form five. The tiger pertains to metal, metal’s number is four, and it resides in the west. Metal generates water, so the tiger’s child qi pertains to water. Water’s number is one, and it resides in the north. The two things share an office, so four and one combine to form five. The two fives meet in the central palace of *wu* and *ji*, which pertains to earth, earth’s number is five, forming the three fives. The three fives combine to generate the Elixir, and the Elixir is one. These three words—from ancient times to the present—are understood by few. Those who do comprehend them coalesce the infant, a truly rare achievement.\n\n*\"The infant is one containing true qi;\nAfter ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.\"*\n\nOne is the Elixir, and the Elixir is the infant. One is the true qi of Unity, the mother of heaven and earth. My true Unity is the child of heaven and earth. Drawing in the mother qi to return to the five viscera, it subdues the child qi—like a cat seizing a mouse to prevent its escape. Thus, the qi of mother and child entwine within the embryo to coalesce the infant of Unity, hence the term *Great Unity containing the true*. Containing the true qi of Unity is like a woman carrying a child: after ten months, the gestation is complete, and the sacred embryo is naturally born. Likewise, after ten months of work, the elixir is perfected, and one naturally becomes spiritually sagely—hence the saying, *\"After ten months, the embryo is complete, and the foundation of sagehood is laid.\"*",

      "translated_text": "Do not take solitary yin for possessing yang—cultivating but a single element only leads to emaciation and decline.\nStraining the body with presses and stretches is not the Way; refining qi and ingesting mist are all madness.\n\nWithin yang lies yin essence—this is one’s true essence, and it is One.\nEssence generates qi, qi generates spirit; the nourishment and defense of the whole body originate from this.\nWhen the oil is exhausted, the lamp goes out; when the marrow is depleted, the body perishes.\nThis speaks of essence and qi as the very root of the body. Yet how can this substance, which belongs to yin—like cinnabar containing mercury, or fire born within wood—be controlled? Its nature is to flee, easily lost and difficult to capture, refusing to be refined. Without the primal yang elixir of Great Unity to subdue it, there is no way to congeal it into transformation. If one cultivates only this single element, one only grows weaker. Moreover, straining the body with presses and stretches is not the true Way, and those who ingest mist and refine qi are but madmen.\n\nEven if one were to absorb the essence of sun and moon, illuminating the five viscera; circulate the twin passes along the spine to replenish the brain and return essence; achieve liberation from the corpse or enter deep meditation—though there be a thousand methods and ten thousand techniques, they all amount to cultivating but a single element. Solitary yin without yang is like a sparrow or hen brooding an egg: can it ever hatch a chick?\n\nMaster Zhongli said:\nTears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humor—these seven are all yin.\nIf one takes such things as the substance of the elixir, how can one’s spirit ascend to the Jade Capital?\n\nWithin the body, not only is true essence a yin substance—all five viscera and six bowels are yin, not yang. If this is so, can one truly divide heart and kidney into Kan and Li, or take liver and lung as dragon and tiger? Can one use spirit and qi as mother and child, or cling to fluids as mercury and lead? If one clings to such methods in seeking the proof of pure yang, it is like adding ice to cold or hot water to heat—like making turtles fly and snakes dance, only growing more perverse.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\nPlace two women in the same chamber, their beauty most fair; send Su Qin to mediate and Zhang Yi to broker, their eloquence unbounded, their words most persuasive. Though they pour out their hearts to harmonize, seeking to unite as husband and wife, their hair will rot and their teeth decay before they ever know one another.\nTo wed a woman to a woman, to refine yin with yin—why then bind and strangle? How can transformation and life arise?\n\nThe world seeks in vain to subdue mercury and lead—when will they ever see dragon and tiger descend?\nI urge you to exhaustively seek the source of your birth, to return to the root and revert to the origin—this is the King of Medicines.\n\nThe true tiger and true dragon are the two eights.\nThe true lead and true mercury are the qi of the two phases.\nThis Way is most simple, most near, most immediate—yet scholars cling to perverse interpretations, stubbornly recognizing only side doors. They do not know their own kind, vainly seeking mercury and lead. How could they know that the immortal elders directly point to the very source of mercury and lead, the riverhead from which they spring? Exhaust the root of your body—whence you came, where life is established—and in reversing this, returning to the source, the true dragon and true tiger will descend of themselves, the true lead and true mercury will be subdued of themselves. Who but the King of Medicines could achieve this?\n\nIn recent times, some have likened the minor elixir of Primordial Unity to the golden elixir—like grasping at the moon by climbing bamboo, is this not far from the mark? All that is born after heaven and earth, possessing form and substance, is not the supreme medicine. For that which lies below form is not the Way of the primordial.\n\nNot recognizing true lead as the true ancestor, all efforts are wasted.\nThe essence of true lead lies in the two eights—all else is not the true Way. Since it is not the true Way, all effort is in vain.\n\nSevering ties with one’s wife, vainly separating yin and yang—\n*The Song of Breaking Delusion* from Yimen says:\nSolitary yin is not the Way; yin and yang lose their proper places.\n\nMaster Wang said:\nThe student stubbornly rejects wife and concubine, not understanding the effortless and the all-pervading.\n\nGao Xiangxian said:\nSome dwell in solitary yang, some in lone yin.\nThis speaks of partial yin or partial yang, of cultivating but a single element, of clinging to bedroom arts and the control of women—slandering the immortal Way, leading one far astray.\n\nFasting only leaves the intestines empty—\n*The Song of Breaking Delusion* says:\nSevering the root is not the Way; the dead become hungry ghosts.\nTruly, these are words of truth.\n\nHerbs, trees, gold, and silver are all coarse substances; mist, clouds, sun, and moon belong to the realm of obscurity.",

      "translated_text": "Xiangchuan’s Anonymous Master Weng Yuanming annotates:\n\nThe Great Dao of Emptiness and Non-being gives rise to the primal qi;\nthis primal qi divides into yin and yang.\nThus, the qi of utmost yang—light and pure—floats upward to become heaven;\nthe qi of utmost yin—heavy and turbid—sinks downward to become earth.\nThe accumulation of pure yang qi that ascends to heaven is the immortal;\nthe accumulation of pure yin qi that descends into earth is the ghost.\nEndowed with the qi of one yin and one yang, a body neither ascends nor sinks,\ndwelling between heaven and earth, may become either immortal or ghost.\nTherefore, if one knows the art of cultivation,\nstripping away all yin to transform the form into pure yang qi, one ascends as an immortal.\nIf one knows not cultivation,\ndaily depleting the original yang to transform the body into pure yin qi, one descends as a ghost.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward;\nthat which is rooted in earth inclines downward.”\nEach follows its kind.\nThus, the sage, observing above and examining below,\nknows that humans, endowed with the finest essence of heaven and earth,\nare the most spiritually noble.\nTherefore, they borrow the true yin and true yang,\nseizing the primal qi prior to heaven and earth to forge the Elixir,\nwhich they ingest into the qi-sea of the Cinnabar Field,\nthereby governing the postnatal qi of the body’s heaven and earth.\nThus, the body’s myriad phenomena naturally return to it,\nas the myriad states pay homage to the sovereign,\nor the stars encircle the North Star.\nKnowing that humans owe their existence to the union of father and mother,\nthey steal the pure essence of yin and yang as the foundation for transformation,\ncalling it the \"yin tally\" and \"yang fire.\"\nCircling through the sixty-four hexagrams,\nrevolving endlessly,\nthey cycle the seventy-two seasonal nodes and twenty-four qi within a single day and night,\nseizing the upright qi of four thousand three hundred and twenty years,\nconverging it within the qi-sea of the Cinnabar Field.\nThey nurture the \"child pearl,\"\nwhich abides in the Central Palace, wu-wei, governing externally.\nThus, externally, it harmonizes the yin-yang tally and fire,\nwhile internally, it generates the true unity of the spirit-body.\nAfter ten months of gestation,\nthe form transforms into pure yang non-being,\nhunger and thirst cannot disturb it,\ncold and heat cannot invade it.\n\nThe method for enriching the state and pacifying the people:\nthe state is an analogy for the body;\nthe people are the essence-qi.\nThe people are the foundation of the state;\nwhen the foundation is firm, the state is at peace.\nIf the state lacks a ruler, to whom shall the people turn?\nIf the ruler lacks ministers, how can the state be governed?\nThus, the sage makes the Elixir the ruler and fire the minister.\nWhen Elixir and fire depend on each other,\nruler and minister rejoice in harmony,\nand the world is well-ordered.\nWhen the essence-people are at peace,\nthe state of the body is enriched.\nThe *Western Florescence Scripture* says:\n“When essence is complete and qi is full, this is enriching the state and pacifying the people.”\nThis occurs after ingesting the Golden Elixir.\nThus, the Immortal Elder appends sixty-four quatrains to dispel delusion,\narranging them according to the hexagrams of the *Book of Changes*,\nto clarify the reckoning of the fire-phase.\nHe further adds twelve *Moon Over the West River* lyrics,\nsymbolizing the twelve months of the \"bathing\" practice.\nThis is why I divide this into the middle volume,\nto elucidate the intent of enriching the state and pacifying the people through the fire-phase.\nSuch is the proper sequence in the practice of Elixir cultivation.\n\n**Sixty-Four Quatrains**\n\nThe radiant Golden Elixir forms in a single day—\nthe ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.\nIf one speaks of nine years or three,\nit is merely procrastination, delaying the schedule.\n\nThe Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir,\nwith effort no more than half an hour,\nyields the Golden Elixir for ingestion.\nThis \"single day\" means the sage condenses a year’s qi-nodes into a month,\nthen condenses a month’s qi-nodes into a day,\nand further condenses a day’s work into an hour.\nGenerally speaking, this is called \"a single day.\"\nThe Immortal Elder says:\n“Exchanging hours for days initiates the divine work.”\nOnce the Golden Elixir enters the mouth,\none immediately ascends to the sacred realm.\nThe analogy clarifies how swift the verification is—\nhow could it take three years or nine,\nprolonging time and delaying the schedule?\n\nFirst take Qian and Kun as the crucible and vessel,\nthen gather the crow and hare as medicine for refinement.\nOnce these two are guided into the Yellow Path,\nhow could the numinous Elixir fail to be born?\n\nAn ancient song says:\n“The sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun;\nhow could the myriad images and all phenomena not be illuminated?”\nThe sage uses Qian and Kun as an analogy for the crucible and vessel,\nand the sun and moon as an analogy for the medicine.\nMoreover, Qian and Kun are the true dragon and true tiger,\nwhile the medicine is the string-qi of dragon and tiger.\nMaster Wei says:\n“The crucible is fundamentally without crucible;\nthe medicine is fundamentally without medicine.”\nThe sage borrows names and adopts analogies in this manner.\nThe essential point lies solely in the initial string-qi of the true dragon and true tiger,\ntheir union and refinement,\nso that the essence of true unity congeals within the Central Palace of the Northern Sea.\nThus, the Immortal Elder says:\n“Once these two are guided into the Yellow Path,\nhow could the numinous Elixir fail to be born?”\nThe Yellow Path is the place of congealment in the Central Palace.\n\nTake the solid center of the Kan position,\nto transmute the inner yin of the Li palace.\nFrom this, transform into the vigorous body of Qian,\nwhere hidden flight and leaping are all at the heart’s

How could the Mysterious Female, a dual entity, be reduced to a single cavity? Since the dawn of creation, without these two, how could the myriad things arise? Thus, from them are established the inner and outer elixirs.

To mistake the mouth and nose for the Mysterious Female is folly; even after a thousand years of breath-work, one only grows weaker with the rising sun.

How could the mediocre know of the life that arises from non-life, or the supreme compliance born of non-compliance? If you fathom this principle of reversal—harm concealing grace—then even a man may conceive.\n\nThe \"killing mechanism\" is the \"mechanism of theft.\" When the moon hangs as a half-wheel at heaven’s edge, the dragon’s roar and tiger’s howl resound. Now is the time to refine the two eights; within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete. The half-wheel of the moon signifies the number eight. The immortal elder reveals that dragon and tiger each possess an eight, combining to form the two eights. The marvelous workings of the Dao all unfold within this single *shi* hour, when the water’s source is utterly pure, possessing qi yet no form.\n\nIn a year, there is but one such day. In a day, but one such *shi* hour. Within this hour, six *hou* periods are divided; applying effort for no more than two *hou* completes the golden elixir. The remaining four *hou* serve other purposes. This is celestial mechanics, not recorded on bamboo or silk, but transmitted mouth-to-heart. The immortal elder speaks of it as a single *shi* hour, hence \"within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete.\"\n\nYe Wenshu, failing to grasp this principle, offered reckless interpretations, claiming the medicine forms in an instant rather than requiring the full hour. Bewildered, he groped in the dark with private conjecture—how laughable! If not for this single hour, would it not become a protracted schedule? How then could it be supremely simple and effortless?\n\nWondrous indeed! This Dao is not something one may hear of in the mortal world.\n\nAccording to Nan Guizi’s *Record of the Fire of the Great Elixir*: \"I have observed that when the sage begins the work of foundation and the initial refinement of lead, he steals the qi of the Three Origins and the great celestial cycle, seizing the 20,736,000 primordial qi. Gathering them in the cauldron of Qian and Kun, assembling them in the chamber of life and death, he exhausts the numbers of heaven and earth, the numbers of sun and moon, the numbers of dragon and tiger, the numbers of generation and completion, the numbers of yin and yang and the Five Phases. Capturing all in a single *shi* hour, he refines a single grain of sacred elixir, as large as a millet seed yet weighing one *jin*, most numinous and sagely, most exalted and noble. It is the primordial essence of heaven and earth, the sovereign of the body. Truly, he steals from heaven and earth, steals from yin and yang, holds the cosmos in his hand, engenders the myriad transformations within his person, and becomes a perfected immortal, a guest of the Supreme Emperor. Thus, my immortal teacher’s words—'within a single *shi* hour, the elixir is complete'—are no empty speech; this is the proof.\"\n\nFire is born of wood, yet its edge lies hidden; without skillful drilling, do not force the attack. Disaster erupts from this—harming oneself. To master it, seek the Golden Duke.\n\nThe classic says: \"Fire is born of wood, but disaster arises from mutual conquest. Essence resides in the body, yet when emotion stirs, it must dissipate.\" Without skillful drilling, this harms oneself.\n\nMaster Lü says: \"The fire burns the seven gates—seal them tightly, lest it scorch the River Chariot’s path. To master it, you must rely on the Golden Duke.\" The *Cantong Qi* states: \"To restrain it, the yellow sprout serves as the root.\"\n\nSetting up the crucible and establishing the cauldron follows Qian and Kun. Tempering the essence refines the po and hun. Gather the scattered to weave transformation; how dare I entrust such mysteries to mere words?\n\nAccumulated yang qi forms heaven, which, though above, does not moisten below. Accumulated yin qi forms earth, which, though below, does not blaze upward. Thus, heaven and earth do not interact. Without interaction, how can the myriad things be born? Though heaven is the most yang of things, it contains a qi of yin, enabling it to descend to earth. Though earth is the most yin of things, it contains a qi of yang, enabling it to ascend to heaven. When these two qi intertwine, the myriad things transform and mature. Through their interaction, change and transformation arise.\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir—setting up the crucible, establishing the cauldron, tempering the essence to refine the hun and po—all emulate heaven and earth. The *Song of the Mother and Child* says: \"When emotions interact, no medicine is needed; when qi harmonizes, no words are spoken.\" The golden elixir takes qi as its kind, binding it to engender transformation. Beginning from non-being to being, then from being back to non-being, its transformations are endless. This is celestial mechanics—how dare I prattle on, risking the fault of careless disclosure?\n\nThe thunderous fire of Kan refines the metal-water phase. Fire erupts from Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined. When these two substances harmonize, the medicine ripens, and fragrance suffuses the body.\n\nThe \"thunderous fire of Kan\" is the fire within water, called the \"yin tally,\" the bowstring qi of the tiger. The \"metal-water phase\" is the Qian position of the northwest, which is the dragon. The west is also the Gate of Heaven, called the Mysterious Gate. Here, the tiger’s fire within yin refines the Qian dragon. The dragon then stirs the fire of Kunlun in response. When the two fires merge, the essence of the True One naturally congeals. Harvest and ingest it at once, and the hundred bones are all ordered—fragrant and delightful.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: \"When golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and clouds. Steaming and permeating the four limbs, the complexion becomes joyful and radiant.\"",

      "translated_text": "Zhen represents the eldest son, the Dragon. Dui represents the youngest daughter, the Tiger. The northern land is the yin entity. The \"flower of yin qi\" is the Tiger’s bowstring qi, called lead-fire. The Blue Maiden is the Alchemical Maiden, the Dragon’s bowstring qi, called mercury-fire. This speaks of the adept refining the elixir, driving the Dragon to approach the Tiger—hence \"suddenly drinks wine from the west.\" The Tiger then opens the yin-gate’s flower to meet the Dragon. When the Azure Dragon’s mercury-fire and White Tiger’s lead-fire unite in love, they seal and converge in the Yellow House, producing the essence of the true One—thus \"if the Blue Maiden and they meet thereafter, all at once the lock opens to dwell in the Yellow House.\"\n\nWithin the crescent moon crucible, jade algae arise;\nin the cinnabar tripod, mercury levels even.\nOnly when fire-force is harmonized,\ndoes the yellow sprout gradually grow.\n\nThe crescent moon crucible is the yin crucible, containing the yang qi of jade algae—the Tiger’s bowstring qi. The cinnabar tripod is the yang tripod, containing the yin qi of mercury—the Dragon’s bowstring qi. The golden elixir arises solely from the harmonious union of these two bowstring fires. Once balanced, the sprout of the true One takes root in the Yellow House, maturing into a grain of millet.\n\nDreaming of an audience with Western Florescence, ascending to the Nine Heavens,\nI was clearly bestowed the *Zhixuan* scroll.\nIts words were few and simple,\nonly teaching one to refine mercury and lead.\n\nGao Xiangxian said: Lost in meditation, my soul ascended to Jade Capital. The Lord took pity and commanded Lady Western Florescence to reveal the elixir formula. Its scroll briefly stated:\n*\"Shu Tong engaged in the work, Wei Boyang led the way,\nlaughing as they entered the Land of Nothing-Whatsoever.\nFollowing the *Lianshan*, they composed the *Cantongqi*,\nleaving it as the eternal sovereign of ten-thousand-generation elixirs.\"*\nIts opening lines read:\n*\"Qian and Kun are the gates of the Yi,\nQian’s Way is male, Kun’s Way is female.\nYet people know not true yin and yang,\nvaguely seeking Dragon and Tiger across the world.\"*\nThough its words are many, it only teaches one to recognize the true Dragon and true Tiger, to refine lead and mercury.\n\nAfter bathing in the Flowery Pond, the moon’s radiance clears;\nriding a golden dragon, I visit the Purple Tenuity.\nFrom then on, after meeting the host of immortals,\ntides and valleys shift at will.\n\nThe Flowery Pond is the elixir. Once consumed, the work is complete—transformation is divine. The skin becomes like ice and snow, the form graceful as a maiden, the countenance bright as the autumn moon. Riding qi upon clouds, wandering the boundless, I observe the mortal world: seas turn to mulberry fields, mulberry fields to seas.\n\nWithout refining the returning elixir, do not retreat to the mountains.\nWithin and without the mountains, all is not lead.\nThis supreme treasure exists in every household,\nyet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.\n\nThe Dragon is not in the eastern sea, nor the Tiger in the western mountains. Every household possesses them. Reverse the process and refine them, and the returning elixir may be attained. The mountains’ yin stillness, inside and out, is not lead—lead is the true yang entity, not distant at all.\n\nEven if one knows cinnabar and black lead,\nwithout knowing the fire-timing, it is as idle as leisure.\nThe work depends entirely on the power of cultivation;\nthe slightest deviation prevents the elixir’s formation.\n\nThe golden elixir’s transformation relies wholly on the Metal Lord.\nThe slightest error creates a gulf of a thousand miles.\nThus the sages transmitted the medicine but not the fire.\n\nDo not cling to the elixir furnace and waste effort;\nto refine the medicine, seek the crescent moon crucible.\nIt naturally possesses true fire for nurturing—\nno need for firewood, charcoal, or bellows.\n\nYe Wenshu misidentified the space between the two kidneys as the crescent moon crucible—how mistaken! Unwilling to reflect on his own error, he further misled others with his flawed path. How reckless! This crucible’s mouth opens upward like an inverted crescent, hence its name. It is the Northern Sea, where the primordial ancestral qi resides. Within it dwells natural true fire—what need is there for firewood, charcoal, or bellows?\n\nWhen the first yang stirs at the time of elixir-making,\nthe lead tripod warms gently, illuminating the curtains.\nAt the initial reception of qi, it is easily obtained;\nin withdrawal and addition, exercise utmost caution.\n\nWhen the first yang stirs, it is the position of the *ninth yang*, the hidden dragon. Act swiftly, and the work may be completed in due time—why wait nine years or three? Who knows that at the very beginning of the work, the radiant golden elixir, large as a grain of millet, is gathered into the Yellow Court and nurtured into the supreme treasure?\n\nThe lead tripod is the Cavern-Yang Golden Tripod, existing in the void and profound obscurity—it is the natural tripod. Lead is the entity within primordial emptiness. After commencing the work, the lead tripod warms gently, like fire’s attack, like clouds’ spread, harmonizing temperament and suffusing the seas and mountains. If the lead is true, it does not lose its role as the household minister. Thus lead is the ancestral founder, dwelling within the Mysterious Female, the root of heaven and earth. Without tranquility, it cannot be completed; without application, it cannot be obtained—its Way is most wondrous.\n\n\"Illuminating the curtains\" refers to the radiant essence overflowing during refinement, and after practice, even the finest hairs become visible, revealing the organs within. \"Receiving qi\" refers to the initial reception of qi, when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born—success lies in receiving qi. \"Guarding against danger\" refers to the peril in withdrawal and addition. Know its hidden subtleties, weigh them carefully, and do not neglect the timing. In application, guard against danger and do not underestimate the process—hence the risk of withdrawal and addition.\n\nThe marvelous qi of heaven and earth follows the *Yi*’s symbolic method. Have you not heard? With a single swing of the *jia*-sword, demonic armies scatter—this is the power of harmony.\n\nThe Mysterious Pearl takes form as yang arises;\nwhen yang reaches its peak, yin dissipates, stripping away all form.\nAfter ten months, frost descends and the elixir ripens—\neven gods and ghosts must then stand in awe.\n\nThe Golden Liquor Returning Elixir, when warmed, takes form. From the winter solstice’s yang hour at midnight, advance the yang fire, thus generating true essence as yang pursues it. From the summer solstice’s yin hour at noon, advance the yin tally, stripping away until the tenth month’s frost-descending time, when the returning elixir finally ripens. Shedding the embryo and transforming into a purely yang Heavenly Immortal, even ghosts are startled and gods submit.\n\nIn the months of the Hare and Rooster, at their appointed times,\nPunishment and Virtue arrive at the gate—these are the elixir’s symbols.",

in ten months, one stares in vain.*\n*Saints and mortals mingle in the marketplace, fish and dragons blend on the thoroughfare.*\n*How vexing for the people of this world—face to face, yet never meeting.*\n\nThe method of *observing form, sealing qi, and contemplating spirit*:\nat first, the path is arduous; later, it becomes smooth and unobstructed.\nIn an instant, one may traverse ten thousand lands—\nsuch is the subtle clarity of the yin spirit.\nYet alas, the form remains yin, prone to decay and difficult to stabilize,\ninevitably leading to rebirth through womb-seizing or body-snatching.\n\nThose who practice *womb-seizing, body-snatching, or relocation* are called the \"Four Fruits\" disciples—\ntheir cultivation pertains to the yin spirit, making them ghost-immortals, not yang-immortals.\nIf one can subdue the dragon and tame the tiger, refine and ingest the golden elixir,\ntransforming form into formlessness to become a yang-immortal,\nonly then does form and spirit together attain wondrousness, uniting with the Dao in truth—\nnever withering, how could this compare to the yin spirit?\nThus, Master Cui said:\n*The numinous light departs, entering profound stillness—*\n*one dies as a radiant ghost of the yin realm.*\n\nThe Buddha’s teaching urges cultivation toward the Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nfor that bliss is none other than the golden realm.\nIn truth, only this form is real—\nthe other two are but vain speculations.\n\nWhen the Buddha taught beings to cultivate the Cold Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nhe referred to the image of wondrous golden hue.\nIn recent times, those who chant the Buddha’s name and transform beings speak of the Pure Land—\nthis is but a teaching for the middling and lesser,\na speck of dust for those of great root and capacity.\nLittle do they know that the true Land of Ultimate Bliss, the Pure Land,\nlies in the West, not far at all—\nthere, true gold is nurtured, each grain as large as a millet seed, weighing sixteen ounces.\nThus, the Buddha is said to possess a sixteen-foot golden body.\nIf one can refine and ingest this true gold, one instantly transcends to the sacred realm,\ntransforming the formed into the formless.\nWhen gathered, the golden form stands majestic; when dispersed, it enters into emptiness,\nits transformations boundless, its movements unfathomable—\nresponding to conditions, pervading all, yet the true body remains quiescent, never acting.\nThis is the Land of Ultimate Bliss in the West.\n\nHence it is said: *In truth, only this form is real—*\n*the other two are but vain speculations.*\n\nThe Buddha entered nirvana at the end of the Zhou dynasty;\nseveral centuries later, during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han,\nhis relics were retrieved and reburied in Fengxiang.\nEmperor Xianzong of Tang later unearthed a bone—\nhow could they have known it was the supreme Way of the Yellow Emperor ascending to heaven on a dragon?\n\nWithin the indistinct and elusive, there is an image;\nwithin the obscure and unfathomable, there is true essence.\nFrom this, being and non-being naturally interpenetrate—\nhow can one conceive of it without first perceiving it?\n\nThat within the indistinct and elusive is the *qi* of the dragon’s bowstring;\nthat within the obscure and unfathomable is the essence of the tiger’s bowstring.\nThe two bowstrings possess *qi* but no substance—\nvague and elusive, obscure and unfathomable,\ninvisible to the eye, inaudible to the ear—\nthis is the true One’s *qi*, numinous yet formless.\n\nThe True One said:\n*Non-being is the dragon; being is the tiger.*\n*Non-being is the qi of mercury; being is the essence of lead.*\nThus, when the *qi* of the two bowstrings intertwine,\nnon-being, moved by being, generates numinosity;\nbeing, stirred by non-being, takes form.\nOnly through the mutual interpenetration of being and non-being\ndoes the true One’s *qi* condense into a millet grain,\nsuspended in the void, its radiance illuminating the sun.\nHow could those who sit in dull contemplation, their minds mired in dust,\never comprehend this?\n\nIn cultivation, blend with the world and harmonize your light;\nbe round when round, square when square.\nConcealed or manifest, yielding or resisting—none can fathom your conduct.\nHow then could others perceive your way of being?\n\nWearing coarse cloth while holding jade,\nharmonizing your light with the dust,\nbreaking through barriers,\ntranscending self and other,\nuniting inner and outer—\nonly then does one embody the immortal’s way of concealment and revelation.\n\n---\n\n**Five Additional Verses**\n\nCease all cunning and false exertions;\nrecognize instead the other’s deathless method.\nIn the flask, ever replenish the wine of life;\nin the crucible, gather the nectar of returning soul.\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* states:\n*Kindred methods yield results with ease;*\n*unrelated arts demand cunning labor.*\nYet many cultivators cling to unrelated, false methods,\nexerting effort upon themselves while refusing to seek the other’s kindred, deathless way.\nIf one can extract from the crucible the yang elixir of returning to the root,\nand within the abdomen ever replenish the mercury fire of life extension—\nthese two are the supreme treasures for refining the body.\n\nFortune and misfortune arise in mutual dependence,\nlike shadow following form, echo answering sound.\nIf one can reverse the mechanism of life and death,\nthen in the turn of a palm, calamity transforms into blessing.\n\nYang governs life and is called fortune;\nyin governs death and is called misfortune.\nAs yin wanes and yang waxes, yang at its peak gives rise to yin—\nmutually dependent, like shadow and echo,\nthis is the natural principle of the common Way.\nIf one can reverse this mechanism of life and death through counter-cultivation,\nthen in the turn of a palm, calamity becomes blessing,\nharm gives birth to grace—\neven a man may conceive.",

resonance.\nThe tortoise is the Black Tiger,\nthe phoenix is the Red Dragon.\nThe Dragon’s string-qi is called the jade mushroom,\nthe Tiger’s child-qi is called the elixir spoon.\nThis speaks of Dragon and Tiger as passionless beings,\nyet capable of union—thus “striking bamboo” signifies their mutual engagement.\nWhen Dragon and Tiger unite as husband and wife in harmony,\nthis is called “plucking the zither.”\nAs Dragon and Tiger couple, the two string-qi devour each other,\nrefining into the golden elixir.\nLight pierces the curtain,\nand in that moment, gather it—\ningest it into the cinnabar field,\nsubduing one’s own yin mercury.\nThen, with hollow heart, circulate the fire,\nharmonizing yin and yang,\naligning with breath.\nThrough breath, direct the spirit-qi,\ngathering and dispersing water and fire.\nWith water and fire, refine and nurture the embryonic breath,\ncontinuously, as if ever-present—\nswimming between Kan and Li,\ntheir intercourse gives birth to the golden liquid.\nThus, when circulating the fire,\nshould you suddenly feel the true qi surge up the spine to the Mud Pill Palace,\ntrickling with sound,\nas if something touches the crown of the brain—\nin an instant, like sparrow’s eggs, grain by grain,\nit ascends from the palate into the Tower of Multi-Storied Chambers,\ncool as ice, sweet as butter, its flavor beyond compare.\nIf this occurs, you have attained the Way of the Golden Liquid Returning Elixir.\nGently swallow it down to the cinnabar field,\nunceasingly, without interruption.\nThe five viscera become clear and empty,\nand with eyes closed, an inner vision reveals light like a candle.\nFrom within the five viscera, ten thousand strands of golden light emerge from the body,\nlike wheels of fire and clouds of mist,\nspiraling to envelop the form—\nradiant and wondrous,\nhow could it be compared to the dust-borne multitudes?\n\nOnce the monkey-heart is stilled and the mind’s mechanism is clear,\nthree thousand merits fulfilled, you stand equal with heaven.\nNaturally, there is a crucible to refine Dragon and Tiger—\nwhy cling to household and yearn for wife and child?\nAfter worldly passions thicken, the Dao-heart is hard to know.\nEach person bears their home and loves their wife and children,\nunaware of the Way of returning to the root.\nThe Immortal Elder sighs in lament,\ncomposing this to admonish those who cultivate the true.\n\nEven if you awaken to the true suchness of nature,\nyou may yet cast off the body only to re-enter it.\nThough you transform and refine the great medicine anew,\nyou transcend the leakless to become a true person.\nBefore the great function manifests,\nbefore the great dharma is fully illuminated,\nthe slightest leakage means casting off the body to re-enter it.\nBut if you achieve perfect clarity and illumination,\nfully refine the golden elixir,\nand complete the ten stages of the Dao,\nyou are called a true person.\n\n*Thirteen Western River Moon Songs*\nThe Immortal Elder says:\n“West” is the direction of metal.\n“River” is the essence of water.\n“Moon” is the function of the medicine.\nThe inner medicine resembles the outer medicine;\ninner communication requires outer communication as well.\nThe elixir head harmonizes similarly,\nwith two kinds of nurturing as its function.\n\nThe *Breaking Delusion Song* of Yi Gate says:\nThe Dao lies in setting up the inner furnace,\nwhile establishing the crucible resides in the outer Way.\nIn the outer, Li and Kan;\nmercury and lead return within.\nThis clarifies the two medicines, inner and outer.\n\nThe outer medicine is the golden elixir.\nIt is wrought in the furnace of the two eights,\ncompleted in less than half a day.\nThe inner medicine is the golden liquid returning elixir.\nIt is wrought within one’s own body,\nwaiting until the tenth month is full\nbefore the embryo can shed its shell and become a sage.\n\nObserving the inner and outer medicines,\nthe harmonizing of the elixir head,\nand the methods of their function—\nthough roughly similar,\nin their application and firing times,\nthey are truly far apart.\nWhen we begin our practice,\nat the moment the inner and outer elixir heads harmonize,\nwe must guard against danger and consider risk,\nnot deviating by even a hair’s breadth.\nBe reverent, be reverent.\n\nWithin, there is the natural true fire,\nin the crucible, a blazing, enduring red.\nThe outer furnace requires diligent effort in increase and decrease—\nnothing surpasses the wondrousness of the true seed.\nThough the inner medicine possesses the true fire within the earthen crucible,\nblazing enduringly red,\nif it does not rely on the outer furnace’s diligent effort,\nadjusting and reducing its operation without error,\nit may yet avoid peril.\nYet the endless transformations of the inner and outer true fires\ntruly depend on the marvel of the true lead.\nThis treasure alone can capture mercury,\npreventing its flight.\nSome, not understanding this principle,\nclaim that the inner medicine is refined by true fire,\nwhile the outer medicine relies on ordinary fire for increase and decrease—\nlike peering at the sky through a tube,\nworthy of a laugh.\nLittle do they know that though inner and outer differ,\ntheir function is the same—\nthe Dao is not two.\n\nWhat is called inner and outer?\nA person’s body is endowed with the essence of heaven and earth,\nentrusted to yin and yang’s forging to take form.\nThus, within a single form,\nessence, qi, and spirit are the foundation.\nSpirit is born of qi,\nqi is born of essence,\nessence is born of spirit.\nYet these three are the one qi of post-heaven,\nthe most yin of things.\nIf a cultivator of the true clings to this body for refinement,\nthey work with nothing more than essence, qi, and spirit.\nAlas, these three are one,\nall born of post-heaven,\npure yin without yang—\nhow could they transcend the things of heaven and earth?\nThus, the Immortal Elder says: refining this alone only exhausts and weakens.\n\nMaster Zhongli says:\nTears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and marrow—\nthese seven have always belonged to yin.\nHe also says:\nRefining a single thing is solitary yin.\nTrue Unity Master says:\nSolitary yin cannot generate on its own.\nThe *Triple Concordance* says:\nA hen laying eggs alone—\nher chicks are never

externally, it is called the outer medicine.\nWith the yang elixir, one captures one’s own yin mercury,\nlike a cat seizing a mouse.\nThe yang elixir is the mother-qi of heaven and earth,\none’s own

to retain mercury,\nthe intimate must never part from the household minister.\n\nLead and elixir belong to metal and thus are external,\nwhile one’s own mercury belongs to wood and thus is internal.\nThe two are separated,\nunable to meet without cause—\nentirely dependent on the Yellow Dame to forge the elixir.\nOnce ingested into the abdomen,\nit pairs with one’s own

disposition yearns for wood’s benevolent kindness.\nThe inner and outer metal and wood,\ntheir indolent natures devouring and yet cherishing each other,\nbecome husband and wife,\nnurturing the infant

      "translated_text": "To achieve the nine revolutions, one must first devote ten months of effort, returning the fire to refine the self, holding the mind in accordance with the time, and circulating the fire. Guard it carefully to prevent danger, probe and adjust, extract and replenish, to stabilize the floating and sinking, and distinguish host from guest. Remain receptive and not assertive, only then can peril be avoided. Thus, the form transforms into qi, qi into spirit, spirit into emptiness, transcending into formlessness.\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl’s love is the root of the Dao; the tortoise and serpent naturally embody it. The toad and crow meet at the new moon in harmonious union, the two qi mutually supporting and revolving. All is the wondrous workings of Heaven and Earth—who can fathom this profound abyss? When yin and yang are blocked and separated, fault arises; how then can heaven endure and earth last long?\n\nThe Cowherd and Weaver Girl unite once a year; the Greater Yin and Greater Yang conjoin once a month. The tortoise and serpent coil together in mutual support—all these are the workings of the two qi of yin and yang, the very root of the true Dao. The workings of the great elixir of golden cinnabar are no different. For the true One’s qi is formless and subtle; without the union of the two and eight qi of yin and yang, how could it manifest in the shape of a millet grain? After obtaining the elixir, without the steaming fusion of yin and yang’s symbolic fire, how could the golden liquid return as the elixir?\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* says:\n*\"Guan guan go the ospreys,\nOn the islet in the river.\nThe modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—\nFor her the gentleman longs.\"*\nThe male does not dwell alone, nor the female reside in solitude. The Dark Warrior’s tortoise and serpent coil together, illustrating that the female and male inherently require each other—this is the principle, what doubt remains? All is the subtle mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s workings, the Dao of creation—who can fathom this profound abyss and reverse the course of cultivation, holding the cosmos in hand?\n\nTrue One Master says: *\"Solitary yin cannot generate itself; solitary yang cannot complete itself. Only through the union of female and male qi can the Dao of embryonic transformation arise.\"* That Heaven and Earth endure long is due to the natural Dao of yin-yang union. If heavenly qi does not descend and earthly qi does not rise, the four seasons lose their order, and the myriad things fail to grow. From this, we see that when yin and yang are blocked, fault arises—how then can Heaven and Earth endure?\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: *\"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.\"* The immortal elder repeatedly emphasizes this chapter; those deeply versed in this Dao should grasp its meaning with intuition.\n\nThis medicine is most sacred and divine—alas, your allotted share is too meager to consume it. Harmonizing lead and mercury takes less than a morning; soon the germ of the mysterious pearl appears. If a person of great virtue can cultivate it, why not dwell in the marketplace or court? The work is easy, the medicine not distant—yet speaking of it makes all break into laughter.\n\nOnce the golden elixir enters the mouth, one ascends to the realm of sages—is this not most sacred and divine? Forged in less than half an hour, the golden elixir immediately manifests its form—is this not most simple and easy? Thus, speaking of it makes one unaware.\n\nThose who attain it fear only that their hidden virtue is too thin to propagate the Dao—this is truly difficult. Without discerning the five phases and four images, how can one distinguish cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver? Unversed in the firing times of elixir refinement, one prematurely claims reclusion. Unwilling to reflect on one’s own errors, one instead teaches mistaken paths to others, leading them astray into eternal delusion—how can such deceit be borne?\n\nThough there are ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures, the wonder lies in the *Cantong Qi*’s three characters. The chapter *\"Song of the Crucible\"* is the marrow of the elixir. Yet the world’s students of this Dao fail to comprehend—why do they not reflect deeply?

      "translated_text": "Why be deluded by the heterodox and the unrefined? Today’s scholars, failing to grasp the method of exhaling the old and inhaling the new, prematurely indulge in flights of cloud-walking and mist-dancing. They exalt themselves as models for others, yet remain unrepentant of their own ignorance, leading others into the depths of delusion—how can they bear a lifetime of such deceit, clinging to their wooden tablets in false contentment?\n\nWhose is the maiden of two eights? Where dwells the gentleman of nine threes? Claiming to be \"wood-fluid\" and \"metal-essence,\" when they meet earth, the three natures coalesce. Two eights is the yin number; the maiden is my true qi, also called wood-fluid. Nine threes is the yang number; the gentleman is the yang elixir, also called metal-essence. When these two substances unite in the earthen crucible of the cinnabar field, the three natures take form. Further refined by Master Ding’s forging, husband and wife at last embrace in joy. The river chariot dare not pause even for a moment, bearing its load to the summit of Kunlun’s peak. Master Ding is fire; the river chariot is water. Water and fire are the yin tally and yang fire. Day and night they revolve without cease, like a waterwheel endlessly turning by the riverbank. This speaks of lead and mercury within the earthen crucible, which must be tempered by fire so that the inner and outer couple may unite in joy. The yin tally and yang fire must never halt; the qi and firing times are borne from the Kunlun summit inward, warming and nurturing the sacred embryo, transmuting it into the pure yang golden liquid great elixir.\n\nWithin the male lies the female’s essence; embracing yin, it yet holds fast to yang’s essence. When these two harmonize, the medicine is complete—transmuting the po and refining the hun into sanctity. Trust in a single grain of the golden elixir: a serpent that swallows it transforms into a dragon, a chicken that consumes it becomes a phoenix. All ascend into the realm of true yang immortality. The male harbors the female—this is the dragon’s latent qi; embracing yin while holding yang—this is the tiger’s latent qi. When these two unite, the numinous elixir is born. Swallowed into the belly, it transmutes the yang hun to dissolve the yin po. A single grain, no larger than a millet seed, whether nurtured by chicken or devoured by serpent, likewise transforms into dragon or phoenix, soaring into the sacred realm of true yang—such is the sanctity of this medicine.\n\nHeaven and earth have just passed through closure and openness; dawn and dusk aptly employ the hexagrams *Tun* and *Meng*. Spokes converge at the hub as rivers flow to the sea—marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition. Before employing fire, the work begins with *Tun* and *Meng* and concludes with *Pi* and *Tai*. Day and night, the tally and fire are borne back to the crucible, like a wheel’s spokes converging at the hub, or the hundred rivers flowing to the sea. The marvel lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.\n\nAttain the One, and all ten thousand things are complete. No need to divide east, west, south, or north. Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work—life’s treasure must not be trifled with. The One is the essence of true unity. The qi of the One arises from yin and yang; yin and yang generate the four images, the four images generate the five phases, the five phases generate the ten thousand things—all emerge from the transformations of the One’s qi. Thus, the essence of the One is the cinnabar of heaven and earth, the ancestor of yin and yang, the progenitor of the four images, the root of the five phases, the foundation of the ten thousand things. Attain this One, and all is complete. East, west, south, and north are all the One. Reduce and reduce again, guarding the prior work, only then can the wonder of the One be fully realized. For the One’s image is manifested through the operation of yin and yang’s two fires. Having attained the One, swallow it into the five viscera, and as before, revolve the yin tally and yang fire—guard the prior work, hence the caution. Beware of peril, prevent danger, do not act rashly, lest the life-treasure, the mysterious pearl, be lost.\n\nAt winter solstice, the one yang returns; every thirty days, a yang line is added. By month’s end, the hexagram *Fu* reverts to *Shuo*; at full moon, the *Qian* culminates, and the omen of *Gou* appears. At winter solstice, the one yang is born, forming the hexagram *Fu*—a single yang line. After thirty days, it becomes *Lin*, with two yang lines. Another thirty days, *Tai*, with three yang lines. Another thirty days, *Dazhuang*, with four yang lines. Another thirty days, *Guai*, with five yang lines. Another thirty days, pure *Qian*, with six yang lines—this is the firing time of yang fire. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born; thus, at summer solstice, the one yin is born, forming the hexagram *Gou*—a single yin line. Likewise, every thirty days, a yin line is added: *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, *Bo*, and finally pure *Kun*—this is the tally of yin. When yin reaches its extreme, yang is reborn, cycling endlessly—such is the qi of a year. The sage transposes this yearly qi into a single month: the new moon’s dawn is *Fu*. Two and a half days correspond to thirty days; by the fifteenth day’s full moon, it is pure *Qian*—hence the moon’s fullness. The sixteenth day is *Gou*, the birth of one yin—thus, \"at full moon, *Qian* ends, and the omen of *Gou* appears.\" *Gou* foretells the initial stirrings of yin qi.\n\nThe day is further divided into cold and heat; yang is reborn at midnight, while at noon, the image of *Gou* brings the first yin of the day. In refining the medicine, one must know the twilight and dawn of yin and yang. The sage transposes the month’s qi into a single day, dividing it into the seasonal qi of cold, heat, warmth, and frost. Thus, the midnight hour of *Zi* is the birth of one yang, forming *Fu*; the noon hour of *Wu* is the birth of one yin, forming *Gou*. The operation of the yin tally and yang fire, the withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat—all must align with heaven and earth’s four seasons and the ascent and descent of yin and yang, without the slightest deviation. In refining the medicine, one must know the dawn and dusk of yin and yang’s inception.\n\nVirtue cultivated surpasses eight hundred; meritorious deeds accumulate to three thousand. Only when self and others, kin and foe, are equalized does one accord with the immortal’s original vow. Tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons cannot harm; the ghost of impermanence and bandits cannot entangle. Once the treasure talisman descends, one ascends to heaven, steadily riding the phoenix and simurgh’s chariot. Embracing the One for nine years, the work is complete, the Dao is achieved—self and others are both forgotten, form dissolves into the formless.",

      "translated_text": "When form has dissolved, how can blades, tigers, or rhinoceroses harm? The fire-house of impermanence—what can it entangle? Thus, one harmonizes light with the vulgar, saves and delivers sentient beings, reckons not self nor other, and embraces all with equanimity. Heaven bestows the treasure talisman, the body ascends to the azure vault—this is the moment when the true great man accomplishes world-transcending merit and fulfills his name.\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body; when refined, its transformations are boundless. Further, one investigates the true source in the nature, realizing the wondrous function of non-arising. Without awaiting another body in a future life, one sees before them the blessings of spiritual penetrations. Naturally, the dragon maiden bestows extraordinary merit—who thereafter can follow in such footsteps?\n\nThe immortal elder composed a scroll of elixir scriptures, fearing later generations would not believe, and further composed twelve *Xijiangyue* verses to clarify the meaning of the Western advent and to convey the purport of the Western return. How could one attain perfect clarity and awakening, yet still hear the supreme Dao?\n\nThe elixir is the wondrous treasure of the colored body; it delivers this colored body, which is itself the empty body. Emptying this illusory body, the jade talisman preserves the spirit, the golden liquid refines the form—form and spirit are both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth. Who knows whether Bodhidharma came from the West for Wuzhen, or Wuzhen for Bodhidharma?\n\nThe middle scroll of *Wuzhenpian* commentary concludes here. (Here a character \"器\" was likely omitted; it has now been supplied.)\n\n**Commentary on the Lower Scroll of *Wuzhenpian***\n*Xiangchuan Wumingzi* Weng Yuanming annotates:\n\nThe lower scroll of *Wuzhen* was composed by Master Ziyang after reading the *Cantongqi*. Its discourse on the immortal’s embrace of the One refers to the sage’s refinement of fire until the work is complete, the body transformed into pure yang qi. Only then does one embrace the origin for nine years, enabling qi to become spirit and merge with the Dao in darkness—this is the meaning.\n\nThus it is said: the Dao is the root of nature; nature is the source of the heart-mind. Heart-mind and nature are of one substance, their transformations boundless. The common folk, not knowing, call it \"natural.\" If one can awaken to this, forgetting images and silencing the heart-mind’s speech, emptying the heart and filling the belly, embracing the One and transcending—after nine cycles of work, one attains immortality. This is its purport.\n\nThe \"nine cycles\" refer to nine years, the number of yang’s culmination. \"One\" is the strong name for the Dao. \"Embrace\" means embracing that which has nothing to embrace. At this juncture, the immortal discards the limbs, dulls brilliance, leaves the mundane world, equalizes self and other, without fixation, without divergence, without grasping, without rejection. Heart-mind and realm become one, free and at ease—thus attaining great stability and emitting celestial radiance. When the nine-year work is complete, the nature of non-doing is spontaneous, the formless spirit is wondrous. Transformations are boundless, concealment and manifestation unfathomable. When nature is rounded, wisdom illuminates the ten directions, spiritual communion is unimpeded—thus one can divide the body into a hundred billion, manifesting boundlessly, while the true essence remains quiescent and never acts. When form, nature, spirit, and life all unite and merge with the Dao in truth, this is called the immortal’s embrace of the One.\n\nIn ancient times, after the immortal elder attained the Dao, he demonstrated to his disciple Liu Fengzhen the entry into quiescence through non-arising. Having entered quiescence, he could yet manifest his true body on Wangwu Mountain—this is the same Dao. Long ago, Bodhidharma sat facing the wall for nine years; having entered quiescence, he could yet return to the West with a single sandal—this is it. Long ago, after the Tathāgata entered nirvana, he raised his golden coffin into the air and transformed it with the fire samādhi. After the body was consumed, moved by his mother’s ceaseless weeping, he could yet manifest his golden body in the air and speak half a verse—this too is the same Dao. Potalaka threw himself into the great flames, yet could release his body in the air. Such examples are too numerous to count. If not for the dual perfection of nature and life, the wondrous union of form and spirit, who could achieve this?\n\nThus, the immortal elder concluded his scroll with Chan teachings on nature and Dao, which are not the same as the immortal’s embrace of the One. Therefore, I have divided it into three scrolls.\n\nThe Dao of nature is vast and boundless, silent and obscure, beyond speech or attainment. Humans and non-humans are all equal, without high or low. Yet since the beginningless beginning, among all things with form and name, not one lacks perfect completeness. For in its original spontaneity, purity, and tranquility, it is fully endowed—thus there has never been anything to say. Yet the great canon contains over five thousand scrolls; these are all those who, failing to taste the Dao, were compelled to speak. Later generations use words to clarify the Dao, but once the Dao is clear, all speech becomes false. Thus the *Diamond Sutra* says: \"If one claims the Tathāgata has spoken dharma, this is slandering the Buddha.\" Know that to speak is to slander.\n\nNow, the immortal elder’s songs on nature and Dao were also compelled by necessity. This is already excessive—thus I dare not add further superfluous commentary. I only wish that the fierce and brilliant may not seek from without, but awaken and clarify directly within their own hearts, shining forth uniquely, directly assuming and receiving the use, unconcerned with stillness or noise, speech or silence, taverns or brothels—whether so or not, all is equal, everywhere harmonious. The ten-direction world is but a single eye, a single body, wondrous functions free and unobstructed, pervading all directions, covering heaven and earth. There is no movement that is not true, no application that is not possible—thus one knows that here, originally pure and complete, nothing is lacking, and all reasoning ceases. Without questioning, without responding, without thought, without knowledge—even the word \"Buddha\" is no longer needed.\n\n**Reading the *Zhouyi Cantongqi***\nThe wondrous workings of the great elixir follow Qian and Kun;\nYin and yang move, the five phases divide.\nWhen the five phases flow in sequence, the common Dao has arising and ceasing;\nWhen the five phases reverse, the elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring.",

Tigers, rhinoceroses, blades, and weapons cannot harm; the ghost of impermanence and bandits cannot entangle.

Embracing the One for nine years, the work is complete, the Dao is achieved—self and others are both forgotten, form dissolves into the formless.",

      "translated_text": "Qian and Kun are father and mother. They move the two qi of yin and yang, transform the five phases, and give birth to the myriad things. Thus, when yin and yang are molded in sequence, a human is formed. Therefore, within the human body, yin and yang are evenly balanced because form arises from yin and yang. Since form arises from yin and yang, there is birth and there is death. Yang governs life, yin governs death—one lives, one dies, one departs, one arrives: this is the natural principle of the common Dao in its sequential flow. The sage takes this as a model, reverses yin and yang, inverts the workings of creation, establishes Qian and Kun as the crucible, and steals the primordial unity of qi to make the elixir. With the elixir, one refines form to enter the formless, merging with the Dao in obscurity, becoming one with the Dao’s boundless nature. How could immortality have an end? Thus, it is eternally numinous and enduring.\n\nFrom the formless, substance is transformed; the Two Modes emerge from the One to establish the root. The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies; the Eight Trigrams mutually serve as ancestors and descendants. The myriad images arise from change and movement; fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse flourish here. The common people do not know this in their daily use, but the sage can fathom its fundamental root. Thus, the *Zhouyi* wondrously embodies the substance and function of creation, and so it entrusts its images to this text.\n\nThe formless is the substance of the Dao. The Dao generates the one qi, which then divides into yin and yang—thus, yang is heaven and yin is earth: these are the Two Modes. Heaven, with the one, generates water, residing in the north as winter. Earth, with the two, generates fire, residing in the south as summer. Heaven, with the three, generates wood, residing in the east as spring. Earth, with the four, generates metal, residing in the west as autumn. These form the four seasons, called the Four Images. Heaven is Qian, residing in *xu* and *hai*. Earth is Kun, residing in *wei* and *shen*. Kun seeks Qian and gives birth to three sons: the eldest is Zhen, residing in *mao*; the middle is Kan, residing in *zi*; the youngest is Gen, residing in *yin* and *chou*. Qian seeks Kun and gives birth to three daughters: the eldest is Xun, residing in *chen* and *si*; the middle is Li, residing in *wu*; the youngest is Dui, residing in *you*. Together, they form the Eight Trigrams, called the eight directions. Thus, from *zi* to *si* is the division of the yang realm, and from *wu* to *hai* is the division of the yin realm. As yin and yang revolve, the qi of the four seasons cycles through the eight directions, alternating in beginning and end, mutually serving as ancestors and descendants, thus generating transformation. Therefore, spring and summer are the qi of utmost yang, nurturing and growing the myriad things with virtue, which the myriad things receive with ease. Autumn and winter are the qi of utmost yin, disciplining and killing the myriad things with punishment, which the myriad things receive with distress. Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, the myriad images, the Eight Trigrams, the four seasons, yin and yang—all emerge from the one qi to give birth to the great Dao.\n\nThus, the great Dao and qi are the ancestors; the four seasons, yin and yang, the five phases, the Eight Trigrams, the myriad images, change and alteration, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—all are one body, present everywhere without exception. Therefore, though one sees and hears, speaks and appears, sleeps and tastes, moves and acts, encounters affairs, or engages in clamor, deception, or strangeness, there is nowhere the Dao is not. Thus, the Dao is within humans, yet humans do not know it; humans are within the Dao, yet the Dao is not diminished. Therefore, the common people use it daily yet remain unaware. The sage explores its mysteries, seeks its foundations, exhausts principle and fulfills nature to reach destiny, and thus can enact the wondrous workings of the Dao of the *Zhouyi*. Establishing Qian and Kun as the gates of the *Zhouyi*, once Qian and Kun are set, the Dao moves within them. Therefore, Qian and Kun seek each other to form the Eight Trigrams, and the Eight Trigrams mutually transform to become the sixty-four hexagrams. Each hexagram has six lines: yang lines are odd, yin lines are even. Thus, one yang line, multiplied by four and nine, yields thirty-six counting rods; six yang lines together yield one hundred ninety-two lines—this is the counting of Qian. One yin line, multiplied by four and six, yields twenty-four counting rods; six yin lines together yield one hundred ninety-two lines. From the two chapters of Qian and Kun, dividing the three hundred eighty-four lines, they combine to form eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods—this is the number of the Great Expansion of the Supreme Polarity, encompassing the Three Powers and containing the myriad images. Thus, the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, the omens of life and death, blessing and calamity—none can escape this number, and all can be examined here. Therefore, it is said that the wondrousness of the *Zhouyi* exhausts the substance and function of creation.\n\nMaster Wei observed that this Dao of the *Zhouyi* parallels the golden elixir, so he entrusted its images to compose the *Cantongqi* to clarify the aims of the great elixir, embedding his meaning within its words.\n\nWhen *Pi* and *Tai* interact, yin and yang either ascend or descend. When *Zhun* and *Meng* arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk. Kan and Li are male and female, water and fire; Zhen and Dui are dragon and tiger, hun and po. Guarding the center yields the primal auspiciousness of the Yellow Skirt; encountering excess leads to honor without position. Having not yet carefully considered the beginning and end of the myriad things, one again harmonizes the return and flight of the two qi. The waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence-spirit; the rising and setting of the sun align with the cold and warmth of construction and defense. The root establishes words to clarify images; once images are obtained, words are forgotten. Just as images are set to point to meaning, when meaning is grasped, all images are discarded. The enlightened seek simplicity and ease; the deluded become increasingly entangled in complexity. Therefore, those who cultivate the truth and read the *Cantongqi* should not cling to images or adhere to words.\n\nThe essentials of elixir refinement do not extend beyond the two words: metal and fire. Metal is the golden elixir, also called true lead. Fire is the two qi of yin and yang, also called yin tally and yang fire. To refine the golden elixir, one first establishes true yin and true yang as the furnace and crucible, then lures the qi of the Supreme Polarity to form the elixir. The qi of the Supreme Polarity blends with the formless and cannot be sought or measured; if not enticed by true yin and true yang, it cannot descend in numinosity to take form. Thus, the *Cantongqi* establishes the two trigrams Qian and Kun as the furnace and crucible, divides the two trigrams Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, and places them in the central palace.",

      "translated_text": "The remaining trigrams are distributed across the thirty days of a month to circulate the tally and fire.\n\nThus, Qian and Kun are the dragon and tiger, Zhen and Dui, husband and wife, hun and po. Kan and Li are lead and mercury, water and fire, the emotional and spiritual nature of man and woman. Extending this by analogy, the comparisons are without end. Yet when one seeks the most fitting expression, nothing surpasses the metaphor of the two substances: true yin and true yang.\n\nBy uniting these two substances and blending their qi within the central palace of the Yellow Path’s chamber, the elixir is refined—hence it is said, “Abiding in the center, the yellow skirt brings primordial auspiciousness.”\n\nOnce the elixir is obtained and ingested, only true fire can nurture the sacred embryo. Thus, the qi of primordial yang is mobilized as fire. Fire has no fixed position but circulates through the six voids—hence it is said, “When encountering *Kang*, it has no position yet is revered.”\n\nThe Heavenly One generates water, which in man is called essence. The Earthly Two generates fire, which in man is called spirit. A person’s essence and spirit, along with the *ying* and *wei* qi, constantly circulate throughout the body in unison with the qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, the four seasons, and the five phases.\n\nAt the winter solstice, the Earth’s single yang qi ascends, forming the *Fu* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi likewise rises—hence the advancement of yang fire. By the second month, the qi of yin and yang are evenly balanced, naturally intermingling to form the *Tai* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi follows the same pattern—thus the cessation of fire is called “bathing.”\n\nAt the summer solstice, the Heaven’s single yin qi descends, forming the *Gou* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi likewise descends—hence the advancement of the yin tally. By the eighth month, the qi of yin and yang are again evenly balanced, naturally intermingling to form the *Pi* hexagram. Man’s primordial qi follows the same pattern—thus the suspension of the tally is also called “bathing.” Hence it is said: “When *Pi* and *Tai* alternate, yin and yang either ascend or descend.”\n\nThe sage transposes the qi phases of a year into the thirty days of a month, calculating two and a half days per phase to correspond to a month. Thus, from the first day of the month onward, the first glimmer of the moon’s yin light appears, and the *Fu* hexagram governs. From the sixteenth day onward, the moon gradually wanes, and the *Gou* hexagram governs. By the twenty-third day, the moon is half diminished, metal and water equally divided, and the *Pi* hexagram governs. Hence it is said: “The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit.”\n\nFurthermore, the sage transposes the qi phases of a month into the twelve hours of a day. At the *zi* hour, a single yang arises—thus in man, a pure yang qi of essence ascends from the kidneys, advancing yang fire to form the *Fu* hexagram. At the *wu* hour, a single yin arises—thus in man, a supreme yin qi of spirit descends from the heart, advancing the yin tally to form the *Gou* hexagram. Hence it is said: “*Fu* and *Gou* illuminate the return and flight of the two qi.”\n\nThe sun’s rising marks day, its setting marks night. The sage mobilizes the tally and fire within a single day and night, distinguishing the qi of warmth, coolness, cold, and heat, externally aligning with Heaven’s tally and internally harmonizing with the *ying* and *wei*, thereby regulating the body’s waxing and waning, drawing and replenishing, nurturing the child-pearl. Hence it is said: “The sun’s rising and setting correspond to the cold and warmth of the *ying* and *wei*.”\n\nAt the *zi* hour, yang fire is initiated—*zi* being the first of the six yang hours, thus the *Zhun* hexagram governs at dawn. Hence it is said: “When *Zhun* and *Meng* act, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk.” In one day and night, two hexagrams govern; in thirty days, sixty hexagrams are calculated. *Zhun* and *Meng* mark the beginning of the sixty hexagrams, while *Ji Ji* marks their end. Ending and beginning anew, beginning and ending again—hence it is said: “*Ji Ji* cautiously observes the end and beginning of the myriad things.”\n\nAll the above demonstrates how Master Wei made the Dao of the golden elixir utterly simple and effortless, with no need for elaborate exposition of secret teachings. Thus, he borrowed the imagery of the *Yijing*’s hexagrams to convey his meaning, enabling students to contemplate these symbolic forms and grasp their intent, thereby understanding his words.\n\nIf one attains the secret essentials of the golden elixir, then Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, Zhen and Dui, dragon and tiger, emotional nature and spirit, lead and mercury, water and fire—all such terms may be discarded. If one comprehends the true mechanism of firing, then the hexagrams *Zhun*, *Meng*, *Ji Ji*, *Fu*, *Gou*, *Pi*, *Tai*, and their lines and grains become superfluous.\n\nThis immortal elder, fearing that students reading the *Cantongqi* would fail to grasp Master Wei’s intent—clinging only to images and words while missing the meaning of “pointing to the image yet forgetting the words”—thus composed this to enlighten like-minded seekers. Such is his benevolence in aiding all beings.\n\nYet without the oral instructions of a true master, one cannot even approach a ten-thousandth part of the inner sanctum. *Commentary on the Wuzhen Pian, Scroll Three, Concluded*",
      "overlap_context": "establishes true yin and true yang as the furnace and crucible, then lures the qi of the Supreme Polarity to form the elixir. The qi of the Supreme Polarity blends with the formless and cannot be sought or measured; if not enticed by true yin and true yang, it cannot descend in numinosity to take form. Thus, the *Cantongqi* establishes the two trigrams Qian and Kun as the furnace and crucible, divides the two trigrams Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, and places them in the central palace.",
