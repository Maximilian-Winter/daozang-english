  "full_translation": "**Hagiography of the Perfected Immortal Lord Xu**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Hagiography of the Perfected Immortal Lord Xu*\n*One fascicle. Source text from the* Zhengtong Daoist Canon *(*Daozang*), Cavern of Mystery (Dongxuan) Department, Registers and Records (Pulu) Category.*\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord Xu, Supreme Daoist Historian of the Nine Provinces, Grand Master of Lofty Illumination, Enlightened Servant of the Supreme Dao, Marvelously Efficacious Divine Worker of Wondrous Salvation—his surname was Xu, his given name Sun, and his courtesy name Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Dan, his grandfather Yu, and his father Su. The family hailed from Xuchang, men of noble integrity who never entered official service, descendants of the Yingyang You lineage.\n\nDuring the late Han, his father fled turmoil and settled in Nanchang of Yuzhang, where they established their home. His mother, the Lady, once dreamed of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She played with it and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus was the Perfected Lord born, in the second year of the Chiwu reign of Emperor Sun Quan, on the twenty-eighth day of the first month.\n\nFrom birth, the Perfected Lord was precocious, and from childhood, he was open and unobstructed in his dealings with all things. Once, while hunting, he shot a deer. The fawn within it fell, and though the mother deer turned to lick it, she died before finishing. Moved by this, he was suddenly enlightened, cast aside his bow and arrows, and devoted himself to the Dao.\n\nThe Perfected Lord applied himself diligently to learning, mastering the classics and histories, as well as astronomy, geography, music, the Five Phases, and the warp and weft of the cosmos. He was especially fond of the arts of divine transcendence and self-cultivation, exhaustively studying and investigating their profound mysteries.\n\nHearing that Wu Shiyun of Xi’an had obtained the divine prescriptions of the Perfected One Ding Yi, that Bao Shuo of Nanhai possessed secret methods, and that the White Cloud Talisman had descended from heaven, he journeyed to study under them. Shiyun, perceiving a deep karmic affinity, transmitted all his esoteric essentials. The *Great Elixir of Spontaneous Fulfillment*, still handed down today, is one of Ding Yi’s divine prescriptions.\n\nXi’an is now Ningzhou. Shiyun served as magistrate of Xi’an under the Wu and settled there. Sixty *li* from the prefectural seat stands the Xiping Jingwu Immortal Abbey, his former residence.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, together with Guo Pu, sought renowned mountains as a retreat for cultivation. They came upon the Jin family estate on Xiaoyao Mountain and declared it perfectly suited for immortal practice. Together, they paid their respects to Elder Jin. Guo Pu addressed him, saying: “Lord Xu wishes to establish a dwelling for his cultivation and thus pays you this visit.” The elder replied: “If Lord Xu is sincere, he should also acquire the estate’s lands to provide for his daily needs.” The Perfected Lord said: “Though we have only just met, to accept such a gift would be without propriety. I would hear your requirements; the amount is yours to command.” The elder replied: “When true gentlemen find their paths in harmony, they would pledge even their lives—how much more mere worldly possessions?” He then took a large coin, split it in half, and each kept a piece as a contract.\n\nThe Perfected Lord resided in the Jin estate, devoting himself daily to cultivation, seeking neither fame nor advancement. His village was transformed by his filial piety and fraternal love, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. If anyone offered him gifts, he would accept nothing unless it was truly righteous, not even a single coin. Once, a merchant sold him an iron lampstand. That night, as he lit the lamp, he noticed the lacquer peeling in one spot, revealing gold beneath. The next day, he sought out the original owner and returned it.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s reputation for the Dao grew daily. The prefecture recommended him as a *xiaolian* (filial and incorrupt), but he declined. The imperial court repeatedly summoned him with honors, and at last, in the first year of the Taikang reign, he reluctantly accepted the post of magistrate of Jingyang in Shu Commandery at the age of forty-two.\n\nUpon assuming office, he admonished the clerks, eradicated greed and vulgarity, eliminated vexatious regulations, and released prisoners from their fetters, explaining all to them with the Dao. The officials and people were delighted and submitted willingly, all wishing to reform. He taught the people to prioritize loyalty, filial piety, kindness, forbearance, diligence, and frugality. He appointed virtuous and esteemed local scholars to lead by example, so that contentiousness faded daily until lawsuits ceased entirely. At that time, the clerks Hu and Zhan assisted in managing the records and adjudicating governance; they are now worshipped as deities in the temple.\n\nBefore the Perfected Lord took office, a famine left the people unable to pay their taxes, and the commandery and county enforced the law harshly, driving many to flee. When he arrived, he used his divine elixir to transmute tiles and pebbles into gold, secretly burying them in the garden behind the county office. One day, he summoned all those who had not paid their taxes to the courtyard and ordered the clerks to demand payment. He then had the people perform labor in the rear garden, where they dug up the gold and used it to pay their taxes, thus avoiding the threat of exile. The entire county was stabilized. People from neighboring regions, drawn by his virtue and benevolence, flocked to settle under his governance, so that the county’s households multiplied, and its people prospered.\n\nThat year, a great plague struck the commandery, killing seven or eight out of every ten people. The Perfected Lord used the divine prescriptions he had obtained to heal them. All who received his talismans and incantations recovered immediately, and even those with long-standing illnesses were cured without exception. After the commandery’s people were saved, word spread to other regions, and the sick came in droves, numbering in the thousands daily. He then planted bamboo ten *li* outside the city walls by the river, placing talismans within them. Those who drank from the water beneath the bamboo were healed. For the elderly, infirm, and bedridden who could not come themselves, drawing water and drinking it at home also brought recovery. Thus, the people of Shu composed a song:\n\n*No theft among the people,*\n*No deceit among the clerks.*\n*Our lord revives the dead—*\n*No illness can withstand him.*\n\nAfter serving as magistrate of Jingyang for many years, the Perfected Lord foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return home. The people of Shu, moved by his transformative virtue, could not bear to part with him. They built a shrine to him in life, passed down his portrait in their homes, and revered him as a divine being.\n\nOn the day of his departure, those who followed him bearing provisions filled the countryside. Some accompanied him for a thousand *li* before turning back, while others followed him to his home, wishing to serve him without returning. He built a settlement for them on the vacant land east of his residence, its layout resembling a military encampment. They all changed their surnames to Xu, following the Perfected Lord’s clan. To this day, the place is called Xu Family Camp, a testament to his enduring love for the people.\n\nThe Perfected Lord traveled with Lord Wu to Songyang, where they heard that in Danyang County of Jinling, a female master named Chen Mu resided in Huangtang Jing. She was deeply versed in the Dao, so they went to study under her. Mu said: “Long ago, King Xiaoti descended from the Upper Clarity to the home of Lan Gong in Qufu County, Yanzhou, leaving behind the *Golden Elixir and Precious Scripture*, the Bronze Talisman, and the Iron Contract. He told Gong: ‘In a later age of the Jin, the divine immortal Xu Sun will transmit this Dao of mine.’”\n\nShe commanded Gong to pass them to me, that I might safeguard them until your arrival. Many years have now passed, and today I shall transmit them to you.” Thereupon, they ascended the altar, followed the ritual protocols, and took the oath. She conferred upon them the *Zhengyi* method for slaying demons, the arts of the *Three-and-Five Flying Steps*, and all other teachings without reserve.\n\nThe two lords had previously received the methods of Mistress Chen, and after paying their respects and expressing their gratitude, they took their leave. The Perfected Lord resolved in his heart to visit Mistress Chen every year. Sensing his intent, she said: “Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.” She then took a stalk of fragrant grass, cast it southward, and said: “When you return, seek the place where this stalk falls and establish a shrine for me. A single visit each autumn will suffice.”\n\nThe two lords returned and first sought the vicinity where the grass had fallen. Forty *li* south of their residence, they found it already grown into a thicket. There they built a shrine, naming it *Huangtang* after her abode. Today, it is called *Huangtang Longdao Gong*, and every year on the third day of mid-autumn, they make their pilgrimage to pay homage.\n\nOn his return from Songyang, the Perfected Lord passed by the place where Mistress Chen’s grass had fallen. By the roadside, he chanced upon a clear pond and rested there for a while. Today, the village of Qingbei preserves the *Qi Zhen Jing* as a temple, marking the very spot.\n\nHe also saw villagers preparing a lavish feast to sacrifice to the gods, remarking to one another in alarm: “If our offerings are meager, the gods will grow angry and bring disaster upon us.” The Perfected Lord said: “How dare such malevolent spirits act thus?” That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned fierce winds and swift thunder to strike them, uprooting the grove. The next day, he told the villagers: “The demonic shrine has been destroyed. You need not sacrifice here again.” To this day, the site lies abandoned, and the villagers no longer make offerings.\n\nAs the Perfected Lord continued toward the place where the grass had fallen, he saw villagers—young and old—burdened with carrying water from afar, their toil evident. He struck the dry marsh before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them. Even in drought, its waters never fail. Today, it is known as the Stone Well of *Ziyang Jing* in the village of *Daze*.\n\nOnce, the Perfected Lord ascended the summit of *Longcheng* Mountain. Pointing to a spring altar halfway up the slope, he said: “Something strange lies hidden there, and in time, it will become a demonic scourge, bringing harm to the people.” He then planted his sword, performed the rites, and established an altar to suppress it. Today, when the immortals make their annual pilgrimage to Mistress Chen, they rest here, and the place is called *Longcheng Guan*.\n\nCrossing the *Xiao Shu* River—now known as *Huanghu Kou*—the Perfected Lord reached a tavern by the riverbank. Though poor, its host, a man surnamed Zhu, received him with utmost courtesy. In jest, the Perfected Lord drew a pine tree on the wall before departing. From that day forth, the tavern’s profits doubled. Later, when the river overflowed and the embankment burst, all the market stalls were swept away—save for the wall bearing the pine. Today, the place is called *Songhu Market*, and a shrine to Zhu the Earth God is still venerated there.\n\nThe Perfected Lord once refined the divine elixir on *Huanglong* Mountain in *Aicheng*. A dragon-demon lurked in the mountain’s ravine, gathering in the deep pools to conjure floods and threaten the elixir chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched divine soldiers to capture it and pinned it to a stone cliff. To this day, both the *Dingjiao* Stone and the nail remain.\n\nWhen the Perfected Lord’s divine elixir was complete, he offered it in sacrifice at the stone chamber of Immortal Ge on *Mufu* Mountain. Arriving at *Xiuchuan*, he admired the swift currents and the purity of its waters. Drawing his divine sword, he sharpened it on a stone by the stream—now called *Meishan Jingyang Guan*.\n\nCrossing the water, the Perfected Lord ascended *Xiufeng*, where he built an altar atop the peak to offer thanks to the Supreme Emperor. There, he consumed the immortal elixir. Today, the mountain is called *Jingyang Shan*. To the south of the stream stands *Wu Xian Guan*, the former residence of Lord Wu.\n\nPassing through *Xi’an* County—now *Ningzhou*—on his way to Lord Wu’s home, the local earth god came forth to greet him. The Perfected Lord requested that he reveal any demonic forces harming the people, which the god had concealed. As he walked past a small shrine, five divine figures emerged to welcome him, saying: “Here, too, a dragon-demon poisons the people. Knowing of your arrival, it has fled to *E Zhu* to hide. It will return in time—we beseech you to rid the people of this scourge.” The shrine gods, five brothers surnamed Mao, still protect the temple, which lies four hundred paces east of the prefectural seat.\n\nFollowing the shrine gods’ directions, the Perfected Lord pursued the dragon to *E Zhu*. Along the way, he encountered three elders who, when asked about the dragon’s lair, pointed and said: “It hides beneath the bridge ahead.” The Perfected Lord stood by the bridge, brandished his sword, and struck. The dragon, startled, fled into the great river and concealed itself in the depths. He then compelled the local officials and soldiers to drive it out. The dragon burst forth from the upper reaches, and he slew it. The three elders were the deities of the *Puying Sanwang* Shrine, and the place is now marked by *Fulong Bridge* and the *Upper and Lower Dragon Mouths*.\n\nEnraged that the earth god of *Xi’an* had harbored the dragon and failed in his duty, the Perfected Lord sealed the shrine’s gates, halted its sacrifices, and ordered the villagers to worship instead at the small shrine of the Mao brothers. Today, the city god’s temple in *Ningzhou* keeps its main gate perpetually closed; when it opens, the prefecture faces disaster. Meanwhile, the *Xieyou* Shrine receives abundant offerings.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to the prefectural city and remarked: “This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people. Surely there must be those destined for the Dao or immortality among them.” He tested this by mixing several grains of his divine elixir with other medicines and offering them for sale, instructing buyers to take them in faith. Yet not a single person recognized their worth. The Perfected Lord sighed, lamenting the rarity of those fit for immortality.\n\nHearing that a dragon was wreaking havoc in *Xinwu*, he took up his sacred talisman to hunt it down. Passing through what is now *Xianyou Guan*, the dragon, in fear, fled into a stream’s cavern—today’s *Cangxi*. The Perfected Lord inscribed a talisman on a massive boulder and composed a text to suppress the dragon, which remains to this day in the *Yanzhen Guan* courtyard, ten *li* west of *Fengxin* County.\n\nIn the upper reaches of *Haihun*, a giant serpent had burrowed into a mountain, spewing clouds of poisonous vapor that stretched forty *li*, swallowing people and livestock, bringing great harm to the people. The Perfected Lord, upon hearing this, ascended *Beiling*—now *Huixian Feng*—to investigate. Indeed, he saw the sky choked with toxic fumes. Gathering his disciples, he prepared to slay the beast. As they entered its domain, villagers from near and far—hundreds and thousands—came forth to plead their case. The Perfected Lord, moved, said: “The cycles of the world turn, and this calamity has befallen them. What sin have the people committed, to suffer such disaster?”\n\nMy coming here is precisely for this purpose—I swear not to coexist with this serpent, and shall eradicate it for you all.” The Perfected Lord’s disciples, having gathered, likewise urged him to slay the serpent. The Perfected Lord said: “The time must be ripe.” Thereupon, he planted his sword into the earth and silently prayed to Heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and soon a red crow flew past. The Perfected Lord said: “The time has come.” That place was named *Hour of Waiting Terrace*, later renamed *Red Crow Longevity and Sage*, and is today’s *Guangfu Guan*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord arrived at the serpent’s lair, and the villagers all clamored forward to await his command. He planted his sword, deployed his *qi*, and sent forth flying talismans to summon the *She* Lords of *Haihun* and *Nanchang* to jointly drive the serpent from its den. Where the talisman fell, a temple was built, named *Talisman’s Fall*, which is today’s *Nanchang Taihe Guan*. The serpent emerged from its den, raising its head over ten *zhang* high, spewing poison to the heavens. The Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and directed the divine soldiers. He ordered *Wu Jun* to stride forward and cleave its head with his sword, while *Shi Cen*, *Gan Zhan*, and others slashed open its belly. A small serpent, several *zhang* long, slithered out from its abdomen. *Gan Jun* sought to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “It has not yet wrought harm—it must not be wantonly killed.” The small serpent fled seven *li*, and upon hearing the clamor, turned to glance at its mother. The disciples requested to pursue and slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “If this serpent brings harm to the people five hundred years hence, I shall return to slay it, using the brushing of my altar’s pine tree against the ground as proof.” He added: “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my ascension, within the five mounds of *Yuzhang*, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge, their master hailing from *Yuzhang*, greatly propagating my teachings. When the sandbar in the heart of the prefectural river encroaches upon *Shajingkou*, if the small serpent harms the people, those eight hundred shall surely slay it. If it brings no harm, it must not be killed.” The serpent’s offspring thus entered the inlet. Today, *Jianchang* has *Shezi Port* and *Seven Li Hearing*, while *Xinjian* has *Wu City Temple*.\n\nAfter slaying the giant python, the Perfected Lord’s sword was stained with the beast’s foul blood. He sharpened and washed it, then shaved a stone to test its edge. Today, *Jianchang* Prefecture retains the *Cold Water Terrace*, *Sword-Sharpening Pool*, and *Sword-Testing Stone*. The Perfected Lord told his disciples: “Though the great serpent is destroyed, the *jiao* spirit remains unvanquished. That creature is cunning—it must know of my intent to eradicate harm. I fear it may seize an opportunity to breach the prefectural city. Let us return to the prefecture.” *Zhan* and *Cen*, the two disciples, followed him. This was the sixth year of *Yongjia*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were sublime, his fame resounding far and wide. Those seeking to become his disciples numbered in the thousands, yet he could not accommodate them all. He transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and scattered her among the disciples’ quarters at night to test them. The next morning, he inspected them—only ten remained unstained. These were the very disciples who would later ascend as his foremost attendants. Thereafter, whenever he roamed rivers and lakes, none of the *jiao* and serpents he slew failed to submit, while the rest, ashamed, departed. Today, the western ferry of *Jianchang* Prefecture is called *Charcoal Woman Market*, and a temple named *Miaoming Guan* stands there.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to the prefecture with *Gan* and *Shi*, surveying the city. There, a handsome youth of refined bearing, clad in splendid robes, presented himself, announcing his surname as *Shen*. His manners were earnest, his responses swift. He soon took his leave. The Perfected Lord turned to his disciples and said: “That was no man—it was the spirit of an old *jiao*, come to test me. Though its form and appearance were human, a rank wind assailed me. I feigned ignorance to expose its kind fully.” The Perfected Lord, knowing the youth was the old *jiao*’s spirit, tracked its movements. It had transformed into a yellow ox, resting upon the sands of the riverbank. He cut paper to fashion a black ox and sent it to fight. The Perfected Lord ordered his disciples to follow the *jiao* spirit’s trail—it had indeed transformed into a yellow ox upon the sands of the prefectural river, now called *Yellow Ox Shoal*. After the black ox departed, he sent *Shi Cen* to stealthily wield his sword and strike when the *jiao* was off guard. The blow landed upon its left thigh, and the ox fled into a well south of the city. The well remains today at the southeast corner of *Shanglan Temple*, hence its alternate name, *Jiao Well*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord dispatched talismanic officials to pursue the *jiao* spirit. It fled to *Changsha*, entering *Jia Yi*’s well, then emerged and transformed into a man, entering the home of *Jia Yu*. Previously, *Yu*’s wife had taken a concubine, who bore two sons over several years. Each spring and summer, she would depart by boat, returning in autumn with heavy cargo. This time, she suddenly returned early, claiming to *Yu*: “I was robbed and wounded in the thigh.” *Yu* summoned a physician. The Perfected Lord, disguised as a physician, visited *Yu* but was refused entry. He then ascended the hall and rebuked: “This *jiao* spirit of rivers and lakes has wrought harm more than once. I have tracked it here—how dare it flee? Come forth at once!” It revealed its form, and he slew it with his sword. Its two sons, young *jiao*, were also slain. *Jia*’s daughter nearly transformed, but her parents pleaded, and she was spared. The Perfected Lord told *Jia Yu*: “Beneath the *jiao* spirit’s dwelling lies water. Your home’s foundations are now fathoms deep in surging waves. Move swiftly to higher ground, lest you drown.” *Yu*’s household, terrified, relocated to the uplands. Soon, the land collapsed into an abyss, unfathomably deep—today’s *Zhao Tan* in *Changsha*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to *Yuzhang*, but the *jiao* spirit’s remaining followers were numerous. Fearing his certain retribution, they grew uneasy. They transformed into humans and dispersed through the city, seeking out the Perfected Lord’s disciples. Under false pretenses, they said: “My family in *Chang’an* has long revered goodness. I have heard of your master, Lord *Xu*, and his divine sword. I wish to witness its power.” The disciples replied: “Our master’s divine sword—when pointed at the heavens, they split; at the earth, it cracks; at the stars, they lose their course; at rivers, they reverse their flow. No evil can withstand it—it is a treasure of gods and sages.”\n\nThe spirits then asked: “Is there anything it cannot harm?” The disciples replied: “Only winter melons and gourds remain unscathed.”\n\nTaking these words as truth, the *jiao* spirit transformed its entire following into winter melons and gourds, their vines entwined and stretching across the river, drifting downstream in an attempt to flee the region. At dawn, the Perfected Lord sensed a surge of malevolent *qi* and, gazing upon the river, saw the *jiao* spirit’s transformations. He handed his sword to *Shi Cen*, commanding him to tread upon the water and strike. The entire horde of vines and gourds was annihilated without exception, turning the river’s flow to a murky hue.\n\nOnce the iron pillar was forged, the Perfected Lord allowed it to extend several feet above the well’s mouth before securing it with eight chains to anchor the earth’s veins. He then intoned: “If the iron pillar bends, should the demon rise again, I shall return. If the iron pillar stands true, the demon shall be eradicated forever.” From that time onward, the water demons vanished without trace, and the city knew peace.\n\nYet fearing that future generations might breed treachery, he inscribed upon the iron pillar these words:\n*Where the land is strong and hearts are good,*\n*No villainy shall arise.*\n*Should schemers seek to stir,*\n*Their plots shall come to naught.*\n\nHis foresight for posterity was thus profound.\n\nLearning that remnants of the *jiao* and *shen* spirits had scattered into the regions of *Poyang* and *Xunyang*, the Perfected Lord feared their return. He traversed the rivers and lakes to exterminate them. Atop *Yanyao Mountain*, where three *jiao* lakes pierced the great river and connected to *Rao* and *Xin*, he slew the *jiao* demons and established the *Yuyang*, *Kaihua*, and *Taicheng* prefectures to suppress them. He cast iron talismans to seal the mouth of *Poyang Lake*, blocking their path—these remain upon the bell-shaped rock at *Hukou County*. In the river, he forged an iron lid to cover *Luling’s* dark abyss, curbing their lair, and further pressed it with iron talismans and a sacred sword. Thus arose *Feifu Ridge* and *Chongzhen Abbey*.\n\nWhen General *Wang Dun* marched his forces inland and encamped by the lake, the Perfected Lord, along with Lord *Hao* and *Guo Pu*, went to pay their respects. At the banquet, *Wang Dun* asked: “I dreamed of a tree splitting the heavens—what does this portend?” The Perfected Lord replied: “It is no auspicious sign.” Lord *Hao* added: “A tree splitting the heavens spells ‘not yet’ (*wei*).” *Guo Pu* was ordered to divine the matter and declared: “It shall not succeed.” *Wang Dun* then asked: “How long is my lifespan?” *Guo Pu* answered: “If you advance, calamity will soon follow. If you return to *Wuchang*, your years may yet be long.” Enraged, *Wang Dun* demanded: “And how long is *your* lifespan?” *Guo Pu* replied: “By midday today, it shall end.” *Wang Dun* immediately ordered his guards to seize and execute *Guo Pu*. The Perfected Lord cast his cup into the air, where it transformed into a wagtail circling the beams. When *Wang Dun* looked up again, the two Lords had vanished.\n\nThe Perfected Lord and Lord *Hao* traveled to *Jinling*, where they sought to hire a boat to return to *Yuzhang*. The boatman lamented the lack of a helmsman. The Perfected Lord said: “Close your eyes and sit calmly—do not peek. I shall steer for you.” The boatmen agreed. The Perfected Lord summoned two dragons to bear the vessel forward. As they passed *Chiyang*, he pressed his seal into the western cliffside, parting the water demons to clear their path—its imprint remains to this day. The dragon-borne boat soared through the air, swiftly crossing the summit of *Mount Lu* before descending toward the *Golden Palace Grotto* on *Purple Empyrean Peak*. As the Perfected Lord and Lord *Hao* wished to explore the cave, the boat dipped slightly, its hull scraping the treetops with a sharp rasp. Unable to resist, the boatmen stole a glance. The two dragons immediately abandoned the vessel upon a towering peak, snapping its mast into a deep ravine. The Perfected Lord admonished the boatmen: “Having disobeyed my words, where shall you now go?” The boatmen knelt and begged for salvation. The Perfected Lord taught them to ingest sacred herbs, granting them the art of immortality. They vanished into the mountain, where *Iron Boat Peak* and the stone mast in the ravine remain.\n\nFor decades thereafter, the Perfected Lord dwelled in his old retreat, unconcerned with worldly affairs. Daily, he expounded the profound truths of the Dao to his disciples, refining his mastery of the Way. He composed the *Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal* and wrote the *Eight Treasures Teachings*, extolling loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, abundance, tolerance, and forbearance:\n*Loyalty precludes deceit;*\n*Filial piety averts rebellion;*\n*Integrity shuns greed;*\n*Prudence prevents error;*\n*Magnanimity wins the multitude;*\n*Abundance ensures sufficiency;*\n*Tolerance embraces all;*\n*Forbearance brings tranquility.*\n\nThe villages were transformed by his teachings, turning toward goodness and shunning wrongdoing. Filial piety and brotherly love flourished. In his daily life, he moved among people no differently than any other, yet wherever he dwelled, cranes circled and auspicious clouds swirled.\n\nIn the second year of *Ningkang* (374 CE), at the age of one hundred and thirty-six, on the first day of the eighth month, a celestial procession descended from the heavens. Two immortals arrived in a chariot, their retinue resplendent. The Perfected Lord bowed in welcome. The immortals declared: “By decree of the Jade Emperor, we bestow upon you the purple robes of office, appointing you *Supreme Immortal Historian of the Nine Provinces* and *Grand Minister of Lofty Brilliance*. We grant you a feathered robe of purple, a jar of jade elixir, and a casket of golden pills.” The Perfected Lord received these gifts with reverence. One immortal said: “I am *Cui Ziwen*, the Jade Perfected Duke.” The other: “I am *Xiaqiu Zhong*, the Primordial Perfected Minister. We come to announce your ascension.” They then reascended in their cloud chariot.\n\nThe Perfected Lord gathered his disciples and the village elders, announcing his departure. A grand feast was held in his courtyard, where he bid farewell and instructed them to cultivate goodness and merit to attain immortality. He composed the *Book of the Magic Sword* and other works, and for his eleven disciples, he wrote ten five-character, two-rhyme exhortation poems—now known as the *One Hundred Twenty Spirit Lots*. He also bequeathed the *Great Merit Elixir of Wishes Fulfilled* to those disciples who would not ascend with him. These texts remain in circulation.\n\nEach year thereafter, the *Yellow Center Fast* was observed on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. Villagers, young and old, gathered for the ritual. At noon, auspicious clouds filled the sky, celestial music resounded, and a procession of feathered canopies and dragon chariots descended, accompanied by attendants, soldiers, immortal youths, and maidens. The envoys *Cui* and *Xia* reappeared to proclaim the Jade Emperor’s decree, announcing that the *Controller of Destiny* of *Qianshan* had transmitted the golden elixir to the mortal realm. The decree commanded: “Seal the debts and close the forms of *Zi Shen* and his household, kitchen, and dwelling, returning all to the Three Heavens. Swiftly purify the filth, turn from the earth, and ascend. Let the *Great Power Heavenly Guards* and the *Flowing Gold Fire Bells* illuminate the *Central Yellow*, lest negligence arise.”\n\nThe Perfected Lord bowed deeply in reverence to receive the decree. Following the edict of the Jade Messenger and the Most High Lord of Jade Perfection, he chose only six of his many disciples to accompany him, for the rest each had their own appointed day of transcendence and could not join the ascent. He then mounted the dragon chariot, commanding Chen Xun and Shi He to hold the reins and lead the way, Zhou Guang and Zeng Heng to drive the chariots, Huang Renlan and his father’s clan to attend as retinue, and Xu Lie with his mother’s household to follow. The immortal family of forty-two souls, together with their dwelling, ascended simultaneously, even the chickens and dogs soaring in their wake. The villagers, clinging in sorrow and prostrate with grief, could not bear to part; the Perfected Lord thus left behind a cultivation bell and a stone casket as tokens for future generations.\n\nThere was a laborer named Xu Da who, upon hearing of the impending ascent, desperately begged to follow. The Perfected Lord, citing the Jade Messenger’s decree that the number of ascenders was fixed by fate, refused his plea. Instead, he instructed Xu and his wife to transport rice over the western ridge. When they heard of the ascent, they rushed back in panic, overturning their rice cart. Overcome with grief, they beat their breasts and wailed toward the sky. The Perfected Lord then bestowed upon them the arts of earthly immortality. The couple retired into seclusion on West Mountain, where the spilled rice took root and grew anew. To avoid recognition, they changed their surname first to *Wu*, then to *Gan*. Later, they were seen receiving offerings at the temple on Fanchegang in Shengmi Market, though their appearances were fleeting and unpredictable.\n\nAfter the immortal procession had soared for some time, a mortar, a chariot hub, and a chicken coop fell to earth more than ten *li* southeast of the dwelling. Several mice also tumbled down, their intestines dragging yet still alive—presumably for having stolen and consumed the immortal elixir. Those who later encountered them regarded them as auspicious omens. As the Perfected Lord ascended to heaven, rosy clouds and auspicious mists filled the valleys, and for a hundred *li* around, an extraordinary fragrance lingered for a month without dissipating.\n\nEarlier, upon returning from Jingyang, the Perfected Lord had pledged a bolt of Shu brocade to Lady Chen as a token of trust. She fashioned it into a temple curtain, which on this day suddenly flew back, circling the former dwelling before vanishing into the clouds. When the Perfected Lord had first sought the Dao with Guo Pu, they passed through Qiwu Mountain in Yichun, where Wang Shu, son of the Prefectural Clerk, welcomed and honored them. The Perfected Lord imparted immortal arts to him, adding that the site faced a grotto-heaven and overlooked the Yuan River, making it ideal for a Daoist abbey. Wang Shu followed his advice, inscribing the character *jing* (tranquility) on the wall before departing. At the moment of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, his cloud plow passed overhead, and he dispatched two azure-clad attendants to bid farewell. Wang Shu’s entire household entreated for transcendence, but the Perfected Lord replied, “Your immortal bones are not yet fully tempered.” He then bestowed a sprig of immortal thatch, saying, “Cultivate it over time, and you may attain longevity.” Later, Wang’s clan each lived a century, and the immortal thatch remains preserved at Yuxu Abbey in Linjiang.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Mystic Capital and Fiery Might, named Meng and styled Shiyun, was a native of Puyang. Profoundly filial, he practiced the Dao and its arts throughout the Wu and Jin regions. Once, he crossed the Yuzhang River by inscribing it with a feather fan. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended with four disciples at the command of the Celestial Edict.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Peng of Qianhui, named Kang and styled Wuyang, served as Left Assistant in the Ministry of State during the Jin. After attaining the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s guidance, he and his household of twenty-six ascended on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Yongchu era of the Song Emperor Gaozu. The present Zonghua Abbey in Longxing City stands on the site of his former dwelling.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Hong of Hongshi, named He and styled Daoyang, was a Daoist adept of the Fengxian Abbey in Muyang County, Donghai. He attained the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s tutelage and could command spirits and demons to expel malevolent forces. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he was ordered to hold the reins and lead the way.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zhou of Yuantong, named Guang and styled Huichang, was a native of Luling. He studied under the Perfected Lord, diligently practicing the Dao day and night. He built a chamber a hundred paces west of the dwelling, which later became the Taixu Abbey in Xuanzhao Blessed Land. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he harnessed the dragon chariot and ascended.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Gan of Jingxing, named Zhan and styled Bowu, was a native of Fengcang. He studied under the Perfected Lord, eliminating harm and benefiting all beings. On the seventh day of the first month in the first year of the Chen Tianjian era, a Celestial Edict descended, and he ascended in a qilin chariot. The present Qingdu Abbey in Fuzhou stands on the site of his former dwelling, where he stored his elixir, and is known as Feihuang Abbey.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Shi of Yongwu, named Cen and styled Dayu, was a native of Jiujiang. Unmatched in valor, he attained the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s guidance. On the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended at the command of the Celestial Edict. The Zhide Abbey on West Ridge was the terrace from which he observed water demons.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zeng of Shenhui, named Heng and styled Xingguo, was a native of Sishui. Learned and versatile, he studied under the Perfected Lord, mastering essential Daoist talismans, divine methods, and secret arts without omission. Later, he drove the dragon chariot and ascended simultaneously. The present Zhenyang Abbey in Fuzhou stands on the site of his former dwelling.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Chen of Zhengte, named Xun and styled Xiaoju, was a native of Shuchuan. Broadly learned and well-informed, he served as an official in Jingyang under the Perfected Lord, who later took him as a disciple and entrusted him with core responsibilities, overseeing scriptures and guarding the elixir furnace. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he was ordered to hold the reins and lead the way.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Xu of Hejing, named Lie and styled Daowei, was orphaned young and served his mother with utmost filial piety. His mother was the Perfected Lord’s eldest sister. The Perfected Lord built a chamber west of the dwelling for her widowhood, and both mother and son attained the Dao. They received the Celestial Edict to follow the Perfected Lord, ascending with an immortal family of forty-two.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Huang of Chongdao, named Renlan and styled Ziting, was a native of Gao’an. He served as an official in Qingzhou, and the Perfected Lord married his daughter to him. His father, Fu, styled Wanshi, was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt and served as an Imperial Censor. Together, they studied under the Perfected Lord and attained the Dao, ascending with a household of thirty-two.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zhongli of Puhui, named Jia and styled Gongyang, was the son of the Perfected Lord’s second sister. Orphaned young, the Perfected Lord imparted the supreme Dao to him. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended at the command of the Celestial Edict.\n\nThe present Danling Abbey on Ivory Mountain in Xinjian County marks its former site.\n\nThe Cavern Perfected Master Hu of the Dao, named Huichao and styled Basu, was of unknown era. He dwelt at Hongjing in West Mountain of Yuzhang, where the Perfected Lord transmitted to him the Way of the Three Primes and Nine Cycles. On the full moon of the second month in the third year of the Chang’an era of the Tang, he ascended by celestial command. The present Longxing Abbey of Mystic Wonder marks the place where he subdued the camphor-tree spirit.\n\nThe hagiography of the Perfected Lord Xu concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Hagiography of the Perfected Immortal Lord Xu**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Hagiography of the Perfected Immortal Lord Xu*\n*One fascicle. Source text from the* Zhengtong Daoist Canon *(*Daozang*), Cavern of Mystery (Dongxuan) Department, Registers and Records (Pulu) Category.*\n\n---\n\nThe Perfected Immortal Lord Xu, Supreme Daoist Historian of the Nine Provinces, Grand Master of Lofty Illumination, Enlightened Servant of the Supreme Dao, Marvelously Efficacious Divine Worker of Wondrous Salvation—his surname was Xu, his given name Sun, and his courtesy name Jingzhi. His great-grandfather was Dan, his grandfather Yu, and his father Su. The family hailed from Xuchang, men of noble integrity who never entered official service, descendants of the Yingyang You lineage.\n\nDuring the late Han, his father fled turmoil and settled in Nanchang of Yuzhang, where they established their home. His mother, the Lady, once dreamed of a golden phoenix bearing a pearl in its beak, which fell into her palm. She played with it and swallowed it, and upon waking, felt movement in her womb. Thus was the Perfected Lord born, in the second year of the Chiwu reign of Emperor Sun Quan, on the twenty-eighth day of the first month.\n\nFrom birth, the Perfected Lord was precocious, and from childhood, he was open and unobstructed in his dealings with all things. Once, while hunting, he shot a deer. The fawn within it fell, and though the mother deer turned to lick it, she died before finishing. Moved by this, he was suddenly enlightened, cast aside his bow and arrows, and devoted himself to the Dao.\n\nThe Perfected Lord applied himself diligently to learning, mastering the classics and histories, as well as astronomy, geography, music, the Five Phases, and the warp and weft of the cosmos. He was especially fond of the arts of divine transcendence and self-cultivation, exhaustively studying and investigating their profound mysteries.\n\nHearing that Wu Shiyun of Xi’an had obtained the divine prescriptions of the Perfected One Ding Yi, that Bao Shuo of Nanhai possessed secret methods, and that the White Cloud Talisman had descended from heaven, he journeyed to study under them. Shiyun, perceiving a deep karmic affinity, transmitted all his esoteric essentials. The *Great Elixir of Spontaneous Fulfillment*, still handed down today, is one of Ding Yi’s divine prescriptions.\n\nXi’an is now Ningzhou. Shiyun served as magistrate of Xi’an under the Wu and settled there. Sixty *li* from the prefectural seat stands the Xiping Jingwu Immortal Abbey, his former residence.\n\nThe Perfected Lord, together with Guo Pu, sought renowned mountains as a retreat for cultivation. They came upon the Jin family estate on Xiaoyao Mountain and declared it perfectly suited for immortal practice. Together, they paid their respects to Elder Jin. Guo Pu addressed him, saying: “Lord Xu wishes to establish a dwelling for his cultivation and thus pays you this visit.” The elder replied: “If Lord Xu is sincere, he should also acquire the estate’s lands to provide for his daily needs.” The Perfected Lord said: “Though we have only just met, to accept such a gift would be without propriety. I would hear your requirements; the amount is yours to command.” The elder replied: “When true gentlemen find their paths in harmony, they would pledge even their lives—how much more mere worldly possessions?” He then took a large coin, split it in half, and each kept a piece as a contract.\n\nThe Perfected Lord resided in the Jin estate, devoting himself daily to cultivation, seeking neither fame nor advancement. His village was transformed by his filial piety and fraternal love, and his associates admired his virtue and righteousness. If anyone offered him gifts, he would accept nothing unless it was truly righteous, not even a single coin. Once, a merchant sold him an iron lampstand. That night, as he lit the lamp, he noticed the lacquer peeling in one spot, revealing gold beneath. The next day, he sought out the original owner and returned it.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s reputation for the Dao grew daily. The prefecture recommended him as a *xiaolian* (filial and incorrupt), but he declined. The imperial court repeatedly summoned him with honors, and at last, in the first year of the Taikang reign, he reluctantly accepted the post of magistrate of Jingyang in Shu Commandery at the age of forty-two.\n\nUpon assuming office, he admonished the clerks, eradicated greed and vulgarity, eliminated vexatious regulations, and released prisoners from their fetters, explaining all to them with the Dao. The officials and people were delighted and submitted willingly, all wishing to reform. He taught the people to prioritize loyalty, filial piety, kindness, forbearance, diligence, and frugality. He appointed virtuous and esteemed local scholars to lead by example, so that contentiousness faded daily until lawsuits ceased entirely. At that time, the clerks Hu and Zhan assisted in managing the records and adjudicating governance; they are now worshipped as deities in the temple.\n\nBefore the Perfected Lord took office, a famine left the people unable to pay their taxes, and the commandery and county enforced the law harshly, driving many to flee. When he arrived, he used his divine elixir to transmute tiles and pebbles into gold, secretly burying them in the garden behind the county office. One day, he summoned all those who had not paid their taxes to the courtyard and ordered the clerks to demand payment. He then had the people perform labor in the rear garden, where they dug up the gold and used it to pay their taxes, thus avoiding the threat of exile. The entire county was stabilized. People from neighboring regions, drawn by his virtue and benevolence, flocked to settle under his governance, so that the county’s households multiplied, and its people prospered.\n\nThat year, a great plague struck the commandery, killing seven or eight out of every ten people. The Perfected Lord used the divine prescriptions he had obtained to heal them. All who received his talismans and incantations recovered immediately, and even those with long-standing illnesses were cured without exception. After the commandery’s people were saved, word spread to other regions, and the sick came in droves, numbering in the thousands daily. He then planted bamboo ten *li* outside the city walls by the river, placing talismans within them. Those who drank from the water beneath the bamboo were healed. For the elderly, infirm, and bedridden who could not come themselves, drawing water and drinking it at home also brought recovery. Thus, the people of Shu composed a song:\n\n*No theft among the people,*\n*No deceit among the clerks.*\n*Our lord revives the dead—*\n*No illness can withstand him.*\n\nAfter serving as magistrate of Jingyang for many years, the Perfected Lord foresaw the coming chaos of the Jin dynasty and resigned his post to return home. The people of Shu, moved by his transformative virtue, could not bear to part with him. They built a shrine to him in life, passed down his portrait in their homes, and revered him as a divine being.\n\nOn the day of his departure, those who followed him bearing provisions filled the countryside. Some accompanied him for a thousand *li* before turning back, while others followed him to his home, wishing to serve him without returning. He built a settlement for them on the vacant land east of his residence, its layout resembling a military encampment. They all changed their surnames to Xu, following the Perfected Lord’s clan. To this day, the place is called Xu Family Camp, a testament to his enduring love for the people.\n\nThe Perfected Lord traveled with Lord Wu to Songyang, where they heard that in Danyang County of Jinling, a female master named Chen Mu resided in Huangtang Jing. She was deeply versed in the Dao, so they went to study under her. Mu said: “Long ago, King Xiaoti descended from the Upper Clarity to the home of Lan Gong in Qufu County, Yanzhou, leaving behind the *Golden Elixir and Precious Scripture*, the Bronze Talisman, and the Iron Contract. He told Gong: ‘In a later age of the Jin, the divine immortal Xu Sun will transmit this Dao of mine.’”",

      "translated_text": "She commanded Gong to pass them to me, that I might safeguard them until your arrival. Many years have now passed, and today I shall transmit them to you.” Thereupon, they ascended the altar, followed the ritual protocols, and took the oath. She conferred upon them the *Zhengyi* method for slaying demons, the arts of the *Three-and-Five Flying Steps*, and all other teachings without reserve.\n\nThe two lords had previously received the methods of Mistress Chen, and after paying their respects and expressing their gratitude, they took their leave. The Perfected Lord resolved in his heart to visit Mistress Chen every year. Sensing his intent, she said: “Do not come again, for I shall soon return to the Emperor’s realm.” She then took a stalk of fragrant grass, cast it southward, and said: “When you return, seek the place where this stalk falls and establish a shrine for me. A single visit each autumn will suffice.”\n\nThe two lords returned and first sought the vicinity where the grass had fallen. Forty *li* south of their residence, they found it already grown into a thicket. There they built a shrine, naming it *Huangtang* after her abode. Today, it is called *Huangtang Longdao Gong*, and every year on the third day of mid-autumn, they make their pilgrimage to pay homage.\n\nOn his return from Songyang, the Perfected Lord passed by the place where Mistress Chen’s grass had fallen. By the roadside, he chanced upon a clear pond and rested there for a while. Today, the village of Qingbei preserves the *Qi Zhen Jing* as a temple, marking the very spot.\n\nHe also saw villagers preparing a lavish feast to sacrifice to the gods, remarking to one another in alarm: “If our offerings are meager, the gods will grow angry and bring disaster upon us.” The Perfected Lord said: “How dare such malevolent spirits act thus?” That night, he lodged at an inn and summoned fierce winds and swift thunder to strike them, uprooting the grove. The next day, he told the villagers: “The demonic shrine has been destroyed. You need not sacrifice here again.” To this day, the site lies abandoned, and the villagers no longer make offerings.\n\nAs the Perfected Lord continued toward the place where the grass had fallen, he saw villagers—young and old—burdened with carrying water from afar, their toil evident. He struck the dry marsh before the shrine with his staff, and a spring gushed forth to aid them. Even in drought, its waters never fail. Today, it is known as the Stone Well of *Ziyang Jing* in the village of *Daze*.\n\nOnce, the Perfected Lord ascended the summit of *Longcheng* Mountain. Pointing to a spring altar halfway up the slope, he said: “Something strange lies hidden there, and in time, it will become a demonic scourge, bringing harm to the people.” He then planted his sword, performed the rites, and established an altar to suppress it. Today, when the immortals make their annual pilgrimage to Mistress Chen, they rest here, and the place is called *Longcheng Guan*.\n\nCrossing the *Xiao Shu* River—now known as *Huanghu Kou*—the Perfected Lord reached a tavern by the riverbank. Though poor, its host, a man surnamed Zhu, received him with utmost courtesy. In jest, the Perfected Lord drew a pine tree on the wall before departing. From that day forth, the tavern’s profits doubled. Later, when the river overflowed and the embankment burst, all the market stalls were swept away—save for the wall bearing the pine. Today, the place is called *Songhu Market*, and a shrine to Zhu the Earth God is still venerated there.\n\nThe Perfected Lord once refined the divine elixir on *Huanglong* Mountain in *Aicheng*. A dragon-demon lurked in the mountain’s ravine, gathering in the deep pools to conjure floods and threaten the elixir chamber. The Perfected Lord dispatched divine soldiers to capture it and pinned it to a stone cliff. To this day, both the *Dingjiao* Stone and the nail remain.\n\nWhen the Perfected Lord’s divine elixir was complete, he offered it in sacrifice at the stone chamber of Immortal Ge on *Mufu* Mountain. Arriving at *Xiuchuan*, he admired the swift currents and the purity of its waters. Drawing his divine sword, he sharpened it on a stone by the stream—now called *Meishan Jingyang Guan*.\n\nCrossing the water, the Perfected Lord ascended *Xiufeng*, where he built an altar atop the peak to offer thanks to the Supreme Emperor. There, he consumed the immortal elixir. Today, the mountain is called *Jingyang Shan*. To the south of the stream stands *Wu Xian Guan*, the former residence of Lord Wu.\n\nPassing through *Xi’an* County—now *Ningzhou*—on his way to Lord Wu’s home, the local earth god came forth to greet him. The Perfected Lord requested that he reveal any demonic forces harming the people, which the god had concealed. As he walked past a small shrine, five divine figures emerged to welcome him, saying: “Here, too, a dragon-demon poisons the people. Knowing of your arrival, it has fled to *E Zhu* to hide. It will return in time—we beseech you to rid the people of this scourge.” The shrine gods, five brothers surnamed Mao, still protect the temple, which lies four hundred paces east of the prefectural seat.\n\nFollowing the shrine gods’ directions, the Perfected Lord pursued the dragon to *E Zhu*. Along the way, he encountered three elders who, when asked about the dragon’s lair, pointed and said: “It hides beneath the bridge ahead.” The Perfected Lord stood by the bridge, brandished his sword, and struck. The dragon, startled, fled into the great river and concealed itself in the depths. He then compelled the local officials and soldiers to drive it out. The dragon burst forth from the upper reaches, and he slew it. The three elders were the deities of the *Puying Sanwang* Shrine, and the place is now marked by *Fulong Bridge* and the *Upper and Lower Dragon Mouths*.\n\nEnraged that the earth god of *Xi’an* had harbored the dragon and failed in his duty, the Perfected Lord sealed the shrine’s gates, halted its sacrifices, and ordered the villagers to worship instead at the small shrine of the Mao brothers. Today, the city god’s temple in *Ningzhou* keeps its main gate perpetually closed; when it opens, the prefecture faces disaster. Meanwhile, the *Xieyou* Shrine receives abundant offerings.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to the prefectural city and remarked: “This place is a vital hub of water and land routes, teeming with people. Surely there must be those destined for the Dao or immortality among them.” He tested this by mixing several grains of his divine elixir with other medicines and offering them for sale, instructing buyers to take them in faith. Yet not a single person recognized their worth. The Perfected Lord sighed, lamenting the rarity of those fit for immortality.\n\nHearing that a dragon was wreaking havoc in *Xinwu*, he took up his sacred talisman to hunt it down. Passing through what is now *Xianyou Guan*, the dragon, in fear, fled into a stream’s cavern—today’s *Cangxi*. The Perfected Lord inscribed a talisman on a massive boulder and composed a text to suppress the dragon, which remains to this day in the *Yanzhen Guan* courtyard, ten *li* west of *Fengxin* County.\n\nIn the upper reaches of *Haihun*, a giant serpent had burrowed into a mountain, spewing clouds of poisonous vapor that stretched forty *li*, swallowing people and livestock, bringing great harm to the people. The Perfected Lord, upon hearing this, ascended *Beiling*—now *Huixian Feng*—to investigate. Indeed, he saw the sky choked with toxic fumes. Gathering his disciples, he prepared to slay the beast. As they entered its domain, villagers from near and far—hundreds and thousands—came forth to plead their case. The Perfected Lord, moved, said: “The cycles of the world turn, and this calamity has befallen them. What sin have the people committed, to suffer such disaster?”",

      "translated_text": "My coming here is precisely for this purpose—I swear not to coexist with this serpent, and shall eradicate it for you all.” The Perfected Lord’s disciples, having gathered, likewise urged him to slay the serpent. The Perfected Lord said: “The time must be ripe.” Thereupon, he planted his sword into the earth and silently prayed to Heaven. After a long while, a spring gushed forth, and soon a red crow flew past. The Perfected Lord said: “The time has come.” That place was named *Hour of Waiting Terrace*, later renamed *Red Crow Longevity and Sage*, and is today’s *Guangfu Guan*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord arrived at the serpent’s lair, and the villagers all clamored forward to await his command. He planted his sword, deployed his *qi*, and sent forth flying talismans to summon the *She* Lords of *Haihun* and *Nanchang* to jointly drive the serpent from its den. Where the talisman fell, a temple was built, named *Talisman’s Fall*, which is today’s *Nanchang Taihe Guan*. The serpent emerged from its den, raising its head over ten *zhang* high, spewing poison to the heavens. The Perfected Lord whistled, commanding wind and thunder, and directed the divine soldiers. He ordered *Wu Jun* to stride forward and cleave its head with his sword, while *Shi Cen*, *Gan Zhan*, and others slashed open its belly. A small serpent, several *zhang* long, slithered out from its abdomen. *Gan Jun* sought to slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “It has not yet wrought harm—it must not be wantonly killed.” The small serpent fled seven *li*, and upon hearing the clamor, turned to glance at its mother. The disciples requested to pursue and slay it, but the Perfected Lord said: “If this serpent brings harm to the people five hundred years hence, I shall return to slay it, using the brushing of my altar’s pine tree against the ground as proof.” He added: “One thousand two hundred and forty years after my ascension, within the five mounds of *Yuzhang*, eight hundred earthbound immortals shall emerge, their master hailing from *Yuzhang*, greatly propagating my teachings. When the sandbar in the heart of the prefectural river encroaches upon *Shajingkou*, if the small serpent harms the people, those eight hundred shall surely slay it. If it brings no harm, it must not be killed.” The serpent’s offspring thus entered the inlet. Today, *Jianchang* has *Shezi Port* and *Seven Li Hearing*, while *Xinjian* has *Wu City Temple*.\n\nAfter slaying the giant python, the Perfected Lord’s sword was stained with the beast’s foul blood. He sharpened and washed it, then shaved a stone to test its edge. Today, *Jianchang* Prefecture retains the *Cold Water Terrace*, *Sword-Sharpening Pool*, and *Sword-Testing Stone*. The Perfected Lord told his disciples: “Though the great serpent is destroyed, the *jiao* spirit remains unvanquished. That creature is cunning—it must know of my intent to eradicate harm. I fear it may seize an opportunity to breach the prefectural city. Let us return to the prefecture.” *Zhan* and *Cen*, the two disciples, followed him. This was the sixth year of *Yongjia*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord’s Daoist arts were sublime, his fame resounding far and wide. Those seeking to become his disciples numbered in the thousands, yet he could not accommodate them all. He transformed charcoal into a beautiful woman and scattered her among the disciples’ quarters at night to test them. The next morning, he inspected them—only ten remained unstained. These were the very disciples who would later ascend as his foremost attendants. Thereafter, whenever he roamed rivers and lakes, none of the *jiao* and serpents he slew failed to submit, while the rest, ashamed, departed. Today, the western ferry of *Jianchang* Prefecture is called *Charcoal Woman Market*, and a temple named *Miaoming Guan* stands there.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to the prefecture with *Gan* and *Shi*, surveying the city. There, a handsome youth of refined bearing, clad in splendid robes, presented himself, announcing his surname as *Shen*. His manners were earnest, his responses swift. He soon took his leave. The Perfected Lord turned to his disciples and said: “That was no man—it was the spirit of an old *jiao*, come to test me. Though its form and appearance were human, a rank wind assailed me. I feigned ignorance to expose its kind fully.” The Perfected Lord, knowing the youth was the old *jiao*’s spirit, tracked its movements. It had transformed into a yellow ox, resting upon the sands of the riverbank. He cut paper to fashion a black ox and sent it to fight. The Perfected Lord ordered his disciples to follow the *jiao* spirit’s trail—it had indeed transformed into a yellow ox upon the sands of the prefectural river, now called *Yellow Ox Shoal*. After the black ox departed, he sent *Shi Cen* to stealthily wield his sword and strike when the *jiao* was off guard. The blow landed upon its left thigh, and the ox fled into a well south of the city. The well remains today at the southeast corner of *Shanglan Temple*, hence its alternate name, *Jiao Well*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord dispatched talismanic officials to pursue the *jiao* spirit. It fled to *Changsha*, entering *Jia Yi*’s well, then emerged and transformed into a man, entering the home of *Jia Yu*. Previously, *Yu*’s wife had taken a concubine, who bore two sons over several years. Each spring and summer, she would depart by boat, returning in autumn with heavy cargo. This time, she suddenly returned early, claiming to *Yu*: “I was robbed and wounded in the thigh.” *Yu* summoned a physician. The Perfected Lord, disguised as a physician, visited *Yu* but was refused entry. He then ascended the hall and rebuked: “This *jiao* spirit of rivers and lakes has wrought harm more than once. I have tracked it here—how dare it flee? Come forth at once!” It revealed its form, and he slew it with his sword. Its two sons, young *jiao*, were also slain. *Jia*’s daughter nearly transformed, but her parents pleaded, and she was spared. The Perfected Lord told *Jia Yu*: “Beneath the *jiao* spirit’s dwelling lies water. Your home’s foundations are now fathoms deep in surging waves. Move swiftly to higher ground, lest you drown.” *Yu*’s household, terrified, relocated to the uplands. Soon, the land collapsed into an abyss, unfathomably deep—today’s *Zhao Tan* in *Changsha*.\n\nThe Perfected Lord returned to *Yuzhang*, but the *jiao* spirit’s remaining followers were numerous. Fearing his certain retribution, they grew uneasy. They transformed into humans and dispersed through the city, seeking out the Perfected Lord’s disciples. Under false pretenses, they said: “My family in *Chang’an* has long revered goodness. I have heard of your master, Lord *Xu*, and his divine sword. I wish to witness its power.” The disciples replied: “Our master’s divine sword—when pointed at the heavens, they split; at the earth, it cracks; at the stars, they lose their course; at rivers, they reverse their flow. No evil can withstand it—it is a treasure of gods and sages.”",
      "overlap_context": "ing great harm to the people. The Perfected Lord, upon hearing this, ascended *Beiling*—now *Huixian Feng*—to investigate. Indeed, he saw the sky choked with toxic fumes. Gathering his disciples, he prepared to slay the beast. As they entered its domain, villagers from near and far—hundreds and thousands—came forth to plead their case. The Perfected Lord, moved, said: “The cycles of the world turn, and this calamity has befallen them. What sin have the people committed, to suffer such disaster?”",

      "translated_text": "The spirits then asked: “Is there anything it cannot harm?” The disciples replied: “Only winter melons and gourds remain unscathed.”\n\nTaking these words as truth, the *jiao* spirit transformed its entire following into winter melons and gourds, their vines entwined and stretching across the river, drifting downstream in an attempt to flee the region. At dawn, the Perfected Lord sensed a surge of malevolent *qi* and, gazing upon the river, saw the *jiao* spirit’s transformations. He handed his sword to *Shi Cen*, commanding him to tread upon the water and strike. The entire horde of vines and gourds was annihilated without exception, turning the river’s flow to a murky hue.\n\nOnce the iron pillar was forged, the Perfected Lord allowed it to extend several feet above the well’s mouth before securing it with eight chains to anchor the earth’s veins. He then intoned: “If the iron pillar bends, should the demon rise again, I shall return. If the iron pillar stands true, the demon shall be eradicated forever.” From that time onward, the water demons vanished without trace, and the city knew peace.\n\nYet fearing that future generations might breed treachery, he inscribed upon the iron pillar these words:\n*Where the land is strong and hearts are good,*\n*No villainy shall arise.*\n*Should schemers seek to stir,*\n*Their plots shall come to naught.*\n\nHis foresight for posterity was thus profound.\n\nLearning that remnants of the *jiao* and *shen* spirits had scattered into the regions of *Poyang* and *Xunyang*, the Perfected Lord feared their return. He traversed the rivers and lakes to exterminate them. Atop *Yanyao Mountain*, where three *jiao* lakes pierced the great river and connected to *Rao* and *Xin*, he slew the *jiao* demons and established the *Yuyang*, *Kaihua*, and *Taicheng* prefectures to suppress them. He cast iron talismans to seal the mouth of *Poyang Lake*, blocking their path—these remain upon the bell-shaped rock at *Hukou County*. In the river, he forged an iron lid to cover *Luling’s* dark abyss, curbing their lair, and further pressed it with iron talismans and a sacred sword. Thus arose *Feifu Ridge* and *Chongzhen Abbey*.\n\nWhen General *Wang Dun* marched his forces inland and encamped by the lake, the Perfected Lord, along with Lord *Hao* and *Guo Pu*, went to pay their respects. At the banquet, *Wang Dun* asked: “I dreamed of a tree splitting the heavens—what does this portend?” The Perfected Lord replied: “It is no auspicious sign.” Lord *Hao* added: “A tree splitting the heavens spells ‘not yet’ (*wei*).” *Guo Pu* was ordered to divine the matter and declared: “It shall not succeed.” *Wang Dun* then asked: “How long is my lifespan?” *Guo Pu* answered: “If you advance, calamity will soon follow. If you return to *Wuchang*, your years may yet be long.” Enraged, *Wang Dun* demanded: “And how long is *your* lifespan?” *Guo Pu* replied: “By midday today, it shall end.” *Wang Dun* immediately ordered his guards to seize and execute *Guo Pu*. The Perfected Lord cast his cup into the air, where it transformed into a wagtail circling the beams. When *Wang Dun* looked up again, the two Lords had vanished.\n\nThe Perfected Lord and Lord *Hao* traveled to *Jinling*, where they sought to hire a boat to return to *Yuzhang*. The boatman lamented the lack of a helmsman. The Perfected Lord said: “Close your eyes and sit calmly—do not peek. I shall steer for you.” The boatmen agreed. The Perfected Lord summoned two dragons to bear the vessel forward. As they passed *Chiyang*, he pressed his seal into the western cliffside, parting the water demons to clear their path—its imprint remains to this day. The dragon-borne boat soared through the air, swiftly crossing the summit of *Mount Lu* before descending toward the *Golden Palace Grotto* on *Purple Empyrean Peak*. As the Perfected Lord and Lord *Hao* wished to explore the cave, the boat dipped slightly, its hull scraping the treetops with a sharp rasp. Unable to resist, the boatmen stole a glance. The two dragons immediately abandoned the vessel upon a towering peak, snapping its mast into a deep ravine. The Perfected Lord admonished the boatmen: “Having disobeyed my words, where shall you now go?” The boatmen knelt and begged for salvation. The Perfected Lord taught them to ingest sacred herbs, granting them the art of immortality. They vanished into the mountain, where *Iron Boat Peak* and the stone mast in the ravine remain.\n\nFor decades thereafter, the Perfected Lord dwelled in his old retreat, unconcerned with worldly affairs. Daily, he expounded the profound truths of the Dao to his disciples, refining his mastery of the Way. He composed the *Drunken Thoughts of an Immortal* and wrote the *Eight Treasures Teachings*, extolling loyalty, filial piety, integrity, prudence, magnanimity, abundance, tolerance, and forbearance:\n*Loyalty precludes deceit;*\n*Filial piety averts rebellion;*\n*Integrity shuns greed;*\n*Prudence prevents error;*\n*Magnanimity wins the multitude;*\n*Abundance ensures sufficiency;*\n*Tolerance embraces all;*\n*Forbearance brings tranquility.*\n\nThe villages were transformed by his teachings, turning toward goodness and shunning wrongdoing. Filial piety and brotherly love flourished. In his daily life, he moved among people no differently than any other, yet wherever he dwelled, cranes circled and auspicious clouds swirled.\n\nIn the second year of *Ningkang* (374 CE), at the age of one hundred and thirty-six, on the first day of the eighth month, a celestial procession descended from the heavens. Two immortals arrived in a chariot, their retinue resplendent. The Perfected Lord bowed in welcome. The immortals declared: “By decree of the Jade Emperor, we bestow upon you the purple robes of office, appointing you *Supreme Immortal Historian of the Nine Provinces* and *Grand Minister of Lofty Brilliance*. We grant you a feathered robe of purple, a jar of jade elixir, and a casket of golden pills.” The Perfected Lord received these gifts with reverence. One immortal said: “I am *Cui Ziwen*, the Jade Perfected Duke.” The other: “I am *Xiaqiu Zhong*, the Primordial Perfected Minister. We come to announce your ascension.” They then reascended in their cloud chariot.\n\nThe Perfected Lord gathered his disciples and the village elders, announcing his departure. A grand feast was held in his courtyard, where he bid farewell and instructed them to cultivate goodness and merit to attain immortality. He composed the *Book of the Magic Sword* and other works, and for his eleven disciples, he wrote ten five-character, two-rhyme exhortation poems—now known as the *One Hundred Twenty Spirit Lots*. He also bequeathed the *Great Merit Elixir of Wishes Fulfilled* to those disciples who would not ascend with him. These texts remain in circulation.\n\nEach year thereafter, the *Yellow Center Fast* was observed on the fifteenth day of the eighth month. Villagers, young and old, gathered for the ritual. At noon, auspicious clouds filled the sky, celestial music resounded, and a procession of feathered canopies and dragon chariots descended, accompanied by attendants, soldiers, immortal youths, and maidens. The envoys *Cui* and *Xia* reappeared to proclaim the Jade Emperor’s decree, announcing that the *Controller of Destiny* of *Qianshan* had transmitted the golden elixir to the mortal realm. The decree commanded: “Seal the debts and close the forms of *Zi Shen* and his household, kitchen, and dwelling, returning all to the Three Heavens. Swiftly purify the filth, turn from the earth, and ascend. Let the *Great Power Heavenly Guards* and the *Flowing Gold Fire Bells* illuminate the *Central Yellow*, lest negligence arise.”",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected Lord bowed deeply in reverence to receive the decree. Following the edict of the Jade Messenger and the Most High Lord of Jade Perfection, he chose only six of his many disciples to accompany him, for the rest each had their own appointed day of transcendence and could not join the ascent. He then mounted the dragon chariot, commanding Chen Xun and Shi He to hold the reins and lead the way, Zhou Guang and Zeng Heng to drive the chariots, Huang Renlan and his father’s clan to attend as retinue, and Xu Lie with his mother’s household to follow. The immortal family of forty-two souls, together with their dwelling, ascended simultaneously, even the chickens and dogs soaring in their wake. The villagers, clinging in sorrow and prostrate with grief, could not bear to part; the Perfected Lord thus left behind a cultivation bell and a stone casket as tokens for future generations.\n\nThere was a laborer named Xu Da who, upon hearing of the impending ascent, desperately begged to follow. The Perfected Lord, citing the Jade Messenger’s decree that the number of ascenders was fixed by fate, refused his plea. Instead, he instructed Xu and his wife to transport rice over the western ridge. When they heard of the ascent, they rushed back in panic, overturning their rice cart. Overcome with grief, they beat their breasts and wailed toward the sky. The Perfected Lord then bestowed upon them the arts of earthly immortality. The couple retired into seclusion on West Mountain, where the spilled rice took root and grew anew. To avoid recognition, they changed their surname first to *Wu*, then to *Gan*. Later, they were seen receiving offerings at the temple on Fanchegang in Shengmi Market, though their appearances were fleeting and unpredictable.\n\nAfter the immortal procession had soared for some time, a mortar, a chariot hub, and a chicken coop fell to earth more than ten *li* southeast of the dwelling. Several mice also tumbled down, their intestines dragging yet still alive—presumably for having stolen and consumed the immortal elixir. Those who later encountered them regarded them as auspicious omens. As the Perfected Lord ascended to heaven, rosy clouds and auspicious mists filled the valleys, and for a hundred *li* around, an extraordinary fragrance lingered for a month without dissipating.\n\nEarlier, upon returning from Jingyang, the Perfected Lord had pledged a bolt of Shu brocade to Lady Chen as a token of trust. She fashioned it into a temple curtain, which on this day suddenly flew back, circling the former dwelling before vanishing into the clouds. When the Perfected Lord had first sought the Dao with Guo Pu, they passed through Qiwu Mountain in Yichun, where Wang Shu, son of the Prefectural Clerk, welcomed and honored them. The Perfected Lord imparted immortal arts to him, adding that the site faced a grotto-heaven and overlooked the Yuan River, making it ideal for a Daoist abbey. Wang Shu followed his advice, inscribing the character *jing* (tranquility) on the wall before departing. At the moment of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, his cloud plow passed overhead, and he dispatched two azure-clad attendants to bid farewell. Wang Shu’s entire household entreated for transcendence, but the Perfected Lord replied, “Your immortal bones are not yet fully tempered.” He then bestowed a sprig of immortal thatch, saying, “Cultivate it over time, and you may attain longevity.” Later, Wang’s clan each lived a century, and the immortal thatch remains preserved at Yuxu Abbey in Linjiang.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Mystic Capital and Fiery Might, named Meng and styled Shiyun, was a native of Puyang. Profoundly filial, he practiced the Dao and its arts throughout the Wu and Jin regions. Once, he crossed the Yuzhang River by inscribing it with a feather fan. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended with four disciples at the command of the Celestial Edict.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Peng of Qianhui, named Kang and styled Wuyang, served as Left Assistant in the Ministry of State during the Jin. After attaining the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s guidance, he and his household of twenty-six ascended on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the second year of the Yongchu era of the Song Emperor Gaozu. The present Zonghua Abbey in Longxing City stands on the site of his former dwelling.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Hong of Hongshi, named He and styled Daoyang, was a Daoist adept of the Fengxian Abbey in Muyang County, Donghai. He attained the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s tutelage and could command spirits and demons to expel malevolent forces. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he was ordered to hold the reins and lead the way.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zhou of Yuantong, named Guang and styled Huichang, was a native of Luling. He studied under the Perfected Lord, diligently practicing the Dao day and night. He built a chamber a hundred paces west of the dwelling, which later became the Taixu Abbey in Xuanzhao Blessed Land. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he harnessed the dragon chariot and ascended.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Gan of Jingxing, named Zhan and styled Bowu, was a native of Fengcang. He studied under the Perfected Lord, eliminating harm and benefiting all beings. On the seventh day of the first month in the first year of the Chen Tianjian era, a Celestial Edict descended, and he ascended in a qilin chariot. The present Qingdu Abbey in Fuzhou stands on the site of his former dwelling, where he stored his elixir, and is known as Feihuang Abbey.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Shi of Yongwu, named Cen and styled Dayu, was a native of Jiujiang. Unmatched in valor, he attained the Dao under the Perfected Lord’s guidance. On the twenty-eighth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended at the command of the Celestial Edict. The Zhide Abbey on West Ridge was the terrace from which he observed water demons.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zeng of Shenhui, named Heng and styled Xingguo, was a native of Sishui. Learned and versatile, he studied under the Perfected Lord, mastering essential Daoist talismans, divine methods, and secret arts without omission. Later, he drove the dragon chariot and ascended simultaneously. The present Zhenyang Abbey in Fuzhou stands on the site of his former dwelling.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Chen of Zhengte, named Xun and styled Xiaoju, was a native of Shuchuan. Broadly learned and well-informed, he served as an official in Jingyang under the Perfected Lord, who later took him as a disciple and entrusted him with core responsibilities, overseeing scriptures and guarding the elixir furnace. On the day of the Perfected Lord’s ascension, he was ordered to hold the reins and lead the way.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Xu of Hejing, named Lie and styled Daowei, was orphaned young and served his mother with utmost filial piety. His mother was the Perfected Lord’s eldest sister. The Perfected Lord built a chamber west of the dwelling for her widowhood, and both mother and son attained the Dao. They received the Celestial Edict to follow the Perfected Lord, ascending with an immortal family of forty-two.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Huang of Chongdao, named Renlan and styled Ziting, was a native of Gao’an. He served as an official in Qingzhou, and the Perfected Lord married his daughter to him. His father, Fu, styled Wanshi, was nominated as Filial and Incorrupt and served as an Imperial Censor. Together, they studied under the Perfected Lord and attained the Dao, ascending with a household of thirty-two.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Zhongli of Puhui, named Jia and styled Gongyang, was the son of the Perfected Lord’s second sister. Orphaned young, the Perfected Lord imparted the supreme Dao to him. On the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the second year of the Ningkang era, he ascended at the command of the Celestial Edict.",
