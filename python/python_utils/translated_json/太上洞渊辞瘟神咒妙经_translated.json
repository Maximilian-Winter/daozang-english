  "full_translation": "**The Marvelous Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Abyss: The Exorcism of the Plague Spirits**\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning expounded the teachings amidst the assembly within the Upper Yang Palace. Then the Celestial Worthy of the Cavernous Abyss addressed the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, saying: \"I observe that the people of the lower realms are all afflicted with pestilential diseases—their limbs raging with heat, hands and feet aching, heads throbbing, eyes blurred, the five viscera seething as if pierced by needles, unable to take food. How may they be saved and healed?\"\n\nThereupon, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning declared: \"All this arises because the people of the lower realms dwell in the world of men. They show no reverence for the Three Treasures, revile Heaven and curse Earth, utterly lacking in respect and deference. Their hearts engage in deceit and crookedness, committing transgressions and accumulating sins, thus inviting these afflictions to harm them. As common folk, though their bodies be strong and their strength robust, they know not to turn toward the Dao. In their comings and goings, they observe no taboos. This is because the Messengers of the Five Emperors, bearing the celestial talismans, dispatch all manner of diseases. The deeds of men are recorded in the registers, and so their poisons are unleashed. If one inhales them, this illness takes hold. Should any man or woman’s household be stricken with this malady, let the entire family abstain from the five pungent herbs, lower their voices, soften their demeanor, gladden their hearts with compassion, and offer rites of apology and dismissal. Establish an incense altar, invite the Dao and welcome the Perfected Ones, and set up a ritual arena within the home. Burn incense and recite this marvelous scripture, following the teachings to offer rites of apology and open the altar of the Dao. Next, prepare a vegetarian feast with incense and lamps, and in accordance with the ritual, invite the Celestial Talismans, the Twelve-Year Plague Spirit Kings, the Messengers of the Five Emperors, the Seventy-Two Seasonal Sages, the Twenty-Four qi Saintly Hosts, the Great Plague Judges, the Medicinal Administrators, the Plague Messengers of Swine, Sheep, Oxen, and Horses, the Pine Disaster Messengers, the Pestilential Toxin Messengers, the Local Earth Spirit Kings, and the Lords of the Earth Altars—each leading their retinues—to descend upon the ritual arena of the Great Dao. To dissolve these poisons and pestilences, recite this scripture and perform the exorcism at once. If the names of the afflicted remain recorded in the registers, they must be stricken from the records and pardoned, with a memorial submitted to Heaven. Now, let the disciple [Name] submit with reverence, beseeching with sincerity: do not impose obstacles, but transform death into renewed life.\"\n\nThereupon, the Saints, witnessing these rites of apology, withdraw the plagues and gather the poisons, preventing their further spread.\n\nThen the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning proclaimed this verse:\n*The Supreme establishes the teachings and precepts,*\n*Reverence and faith dispel calamities.*\n*Pestilence lingers with poisonous harm,*\n*But hearing the good transforms it to fortune.*\n*Devotion and mindfulness of the Three Treasures*\n*Bring gradual prosperity to the household.*\n*Those who recite this scripture with virtue*\n*Cause demonic misfortunes to vanish in hiding.*\n\nAt that time, the Celestial Worthy of the Cavernous Abyss and the entire assembly, having heard these sacred words, rejoiced exceedingly. They bowed in reverence and withdrew, faithfully receiving and upholding the teachings.\n\n**Here ends *The Marvelous Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Abyss: The Exorcism of the Plague Spirits*.**",
