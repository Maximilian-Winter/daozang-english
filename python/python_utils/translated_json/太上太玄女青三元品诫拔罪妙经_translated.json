  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Most Mysterious Jade Maiden of the Three Primordials’ Precepts for Removing Transgressions: Wondrous Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Most Mysterious Jade Maiden of the Three Primordials’ Precepts for Removing Transgressions: Wondrous Scripture*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Adapted and expanded from *The Scripture on the Merits and Gravity of the Three Primordials’ Precepts*. Three scrolls. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One**\n\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden spoke: In the primordial Dragon Han kalpa, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao, upon the Three Heavens, expounded the great *Three Caverns* Dharma—*The Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Precepts*—to the assembled host of celestial sages, perfected immortals of the ten directions, and boundless assemblies of great saints. At that time, the officials of the Three Realms and the divine immortals of the myriad heavens, numbering in the hundreds of millions, all gathered in solemn attendance, reverently listening to the Dharma-sound.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of Primordial Beginning addressed the great assembly, saying: \"I now broadly proclaim the wondrous Dharma of the Three Vehicles and the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns to all beings within and beyond the Three Realms. I open the path for humans and devas, descending in accord with conditions to receive the beings of the Lower Realm. In the latter age, men and women who do not hear the Dao and its teachings are wrongfully slain in great numbers, failing to complete their allotted years. This arises from the heavy karmic burdens and deep transgressions of humankind, who do not return to the true transformation, turning their backs on reality to follow falsehood, employing only perverse conduct. After death, their souls have no refuge, bound and lodged within the Fengdu Hell. When kalpas end and mountains crumble, they have no means of liberation.\n\nYou, all beings, shall throughout the great chiliocosm and the lands of the ten directions, teach all faithful men and women that from this day forward, they must recite *The Precious Scripture of the Three Primordials* and *The Wondrous Canon of the Jade Maiden*. The merit of this scripture ascends to deliver the heavenly beings and descends to succor those in the long night; its blessings are boundless, its grace sustaining the myriad existences. It spares one from the moment of life’s end, preventing the soul from entering Fengdu to suffer karmic retribution.\"\n\nAt that time, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord of the First Primordial’s Ninefold *Qi* Celestial Office, the talisman of extended life formed from the *qi* of the Beginning Yang, dwelt in the Palace of Seven Treasures of Primordial Yang within the Mysterious Capital, seated upon the Terrace of Azure Radiance in the Hall of Purple Mist, upon a throne of fivefold clouds and a couch of purple gold, leaning upon a table of azure jade, holding a scepter of green jasper. Divine immortals stood in ranks to his left and right, attending as guards.\n\nThe Palace of the Upper Primordial extended five thousand myriad *li* in length and breadth, entirely formed from the *qi* of the Mysterious Azure. It presides over the Supreme Lord of the Jade Void, the High Emperor of the Celestial Worthy of Spontaneous Perfection, the lords of the myriad heavens, the perfected immortals, as well as the rulers of nations, great ministers, empresses, imperial consorts, princes, crown princes, all officials and their families, and the people of the world—every distinction of nobility and baseness, transgression and blessing. The divine officials and bureaucrats therein are all constituted of spontaneous *qi*; unless one is a person of the Golden Portal whose name is recorded on the Jade Tablets of the attained Dao, none may behold it.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity Palace are the Three Bureaus of Left, Right, and Center. The Left Bureau governs the Office of Life, examined by the Fire Official of the Great Yang. The Right Bureau governs the Office of Death, examined by the Water Official of the Great Yin. The Central Bureau governs the Office of Life, Death, Transgression, and Blessing, examined by the Wind Blade. The Three Bureaus comprise thirty-six departments, each overseeing nine thousand myriad officials. On the evening of the Upper Primordial, they collectively examine the causes and karmic retributions of life, death, transgression, and blessing throughout the great chiliocosm and the lands of the ten directions. All beings should be reverent, each person respectful.\n\nWith sincere devotion, they pay homage to:\n\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Perfection Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supervisory Rectitude Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Brahma Conduct Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Numinous Pass Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Divine Prohibition Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Illuminating Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Divinity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Opening Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Jade Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Southern Upper Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Primordial Merit Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Three Numinosities Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Brahma Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Majestic Numinosity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Proclaiming Majesty Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Constancy Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Capital Numinosity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Ceremony Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Dharma Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Examination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Majesty Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Nine Capitals Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Fourfold Illumination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Celestial Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Execution Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Celestial Covenant Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Dark Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Majestic Ceremony Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Yin Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Lower Primordial Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supervisory Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Illumination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Numinous Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\n\nThe thirty-six Celestial Officials of the departments above are governed by the Perfected Person of the Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, subordinate to the Purple Tenuity Palace.\n\nEach department is staffed with one Examiner, one thousand two hundred Examining Clerks, twelve thousand Examining Soldiers, and one hundred twenty thousand Examining Scholars. Together, they oversee all beings in Heaven who have attained the Dao in past lives or have yet to attain it, those presently enjoying blessings, rulers and their ministers, celestial princes, empresses and imperial consorts, all officials and chief ministers, as well as devout men and women—recording their merits, transgressions, sins, and blessings, and assessing the karmic accounts and allotted lifespans.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month each year, the Celestial Official of the Upper Primordial, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord, reviews and evaluates the following across the great thousandfold world and the ten directions’ lands: from the celestial registers of gods and immortals’ ascents and descents, the astrological records of stellar influences over lands and their rise and fall; through the lifespans of rulers, worthy ministers, princes, and all beings; down to the transformations of fish, dragons, and all flying and crawling creatures—recording the years and months of their rebirths and demotions. Within the Three Paths and the Nine Departments, the names of those due for karmic retribution and the durations of their sentences are noted. Those deemed fit to be reborn as humans have their names erased from the registers of the Long Night’s Department and inscribed in the Left Palace. Those destined to become various kinds of demons, evil spirits, or ghosts have their sentences carved in the Right Palace, their names written in the Black Register, awaiting the fulfillment of their allotted time before being reborn in different forms, their rebirths varying according to the weight of their karma.\n\nAmong the sinful souls fated to become flying or crawling creatures, their forms are assigned based on the severity of their sins: some as jackals, wolves, tigers, or leopards; some as donkeys, horses, camels, or mules; some as oxen, sheep, geese, or ducks; some as chickens, dogs, turtledoves, or owls; some as river deer, muntjacs, foxes, or hares; some as sparrows, wagtails, flies, or insects; some as dung beetles, mantises, snakes, or rats; some as mole crickets, ants, mosquitoes, or horseflies; some as dust deer or qilin; some as soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, or giant turtles; some as flood dragons, mirages, cave-dwelling serpents, or water dragons; some as great whales or sea horses; some as conches, clams, insects, or fish; some as crows, pheasants, peacocks, or eagles; some as hawks, sparrowhawks, or flying leopards; some as toads, fleas, or lice; some as ants, centipedes, or millipedes; some as loaches, eels, or jellyfish; some as crabs, scorpions, or spiders; or as creatures of bizarre forms—birds, fish, flying beasts, or monstrous creatures. Such myriad beings may walk, fly, crawl, or sit; they may have many legs or none; they may be born from wombs or eggs; they may dwell in dry or wet places, in nests or burrows. With a hundred forms and a thousand transformations, their names cannot be fixed.\n\nSome dwell in ancient trees or strange rocks; some inhabit deep pools, marshes, or springs; some cling to earthen hills or rocky cliffs; some lurk in wells, stoves, ditches, or canals; some manifest as demons or monsters among humans. All these myriad creatures, burdened with karmic lives, await the fulfillment of their allotted time. On the night when the Celestial Officials review the registers, they are reborn according to their karma, rewarded according to their blessings, cycled through kalpas, and reborn or die according to their deeds. Good and evil follow conditions without distinction.\n\nIf devout men or women resolve to copy this scripture, distribute and recite it, offer incense, flowers, precious canopies, and make offerings to the Celestial Worthies, all their sins will be eradicated. Or, on the evenings of the Three Primordials, they may perform rites to thank the Celestial Worthies; or on the ten auspicious days, recite this scripture to gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: The merits of this scripture can resolve karmic grievances from a hundred lifetimes, erase sins from ten thousand kalpas, eliminate the transgressions of embodied existence, dispel unforeseen disasters, free one from the suffering of death and rebirth, and dissolve the hearts of all evils.\n\nAll beings from this day forward, if afflicted by official misfortune, illness, curses, or vengeful foes, should recite this scripture. If stricken by epidemics, pestilence, or possessed by ghosts and demons, they should hold and recite this scripture. If seeking to prosper in livelihood, venture into the sea for wealth, undertake construction, establish a home, or bury the dead, they should recite this scripture. If facing setbacks in career or demotion in office, or if traveling by boat and fearing waves, they should recite this scripture. To deliver the long-night-bound souls, rescue the suffering in darkness, resolve ancient calamities, and save those in hidden torment, they need only recite this scripture to gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nIf locusts, floods, wars, or rebellions arise, causing rulers distress and people to perish, one should establish a ritual arena in a pure place or an ancient altar within a sacred temple, hang banners and canopies, recite this scripture, light lamps, perform the Daoist walk, and hold a grand offering to the Five Stars and all celestial bodies. Then the land will be at peace, the times harmonious, the people prosperous; locusts and wars will naturally dissipate, and disasters of flood, drought, and wind will be averted.\n\nIf devout men or women suffer lifelong misfortune, weak fate, chronic illness, or incurable afflictions; if they repeatedly violate the law, endure years in shackles; if they are afflicted by madness or possessed by evil spirits—they should copy this scripture, distribute it among beings, and recite it together. For those who do so, all disasters will dissolve, all evils will vanish, their lifespans will be prolonged, and they will gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: All beings cycle through birth and death, their karmic retributions and blessings manifesting without the slightest error. All await the days of the Three Primordials and the nights when the Three Officials review the registers, determining their rebirths, wealth or poverty, paths as humans or ghosts, or forms as birds or beasts. Those destined for blessings have their names inscribed in the Left Palace and carved in the Left Department. Those fated to become ghosts or beasts have their names written in the Right Department and carved in the Right Palace, each awaiting the fulfillment of their allotted time.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: All devout men and women who attain immortal names have their merits and transgressions recorded on jade tablets. Those who have fallen from ranks or await karmic retribution for sins and blessings are likewise recorded in the lifespan registers of the Purple Tenuity Palace. All are sealed in the Jade Cabinet of the Luminous Perfected of the Mysterious Capital, the White Department of the Upper Primordial Celestial Official. They await the days when the Three Officials gather the sages to determine the registers of gods and immortals’ ascents and descents, the depths of karmic conditions for good and evil men and women, the lengths of their lifespans, and the durations of their allotted times. Even the release of those in the Nine Dark Realms from the limits of life, death, sin, and blessing, and the cycles of birth, transformation, decline, and prosperity for all creatures, are recorded and presented to the Supreme Void Emperor Lord of the Dao on the day of the Upper Primordial.\n\nLady Qing said: Within the great thousandfold world and the lands of the ten directions, all good and evil men and women—whether in matters of life, death, sin, or blessing, the weight of their deeds, the span of their lifetimes, or the reckoning of their years, months, and days—are each distinguished in the green and black registers and presented to the Upper Palace. If their virtuous deeds are complete and they are due to become immortals, their names are recorded in the Purple Tenuity Palace. If they have revered the Supreme Dao of the Primordial Mysterious Origin, their names are inscribed in the Left Palace of the Great Ultimate, written in the Golden Register, and engraved in the Immortal Bureau. The Earth Official is then commanded to dispatch attendants to record their names in the Upper Palace, where the Three Realms provide protection. All external demons will no longer disturb them, in accordance with the statutes of Lady Qing. Their names shall be inscribed on the green and black tablets of the Azure Mystery.\n\nNow, the comprehensive registers of life and death overseen by the Supreme Perfected are recorded as follows. All you sentient beings must reverently uphold them:\n\nThe protocols for the ranks, titles, merits, and transgressions of the Supreme Perfected.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions of the assembled sages in their circuits of worship and procession.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions of the Great Sages in their rotating banquets and imperial escorts.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the registers and records of the charts of life and death.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the records of the lifespans and destinies of life and death.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the weighing of the lightness and heaviness of karmic virtue in life and death.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the service and retribution of ghosts and spirits through the turning of the Wheel.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the terms of confinement and deliverance of ghosts and spirits in the dark realms.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the ascension of ghosts and spirits and the rebirth of the dead.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the registers of the dead undergoing refinement and rebirth.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the ranks and purity of immortals who attain the Dao.\nThe protocols for the merits and transgressions in the sounds of the myriad demons’ chants and songs.\n\nThe aforementioned are the names of all merits and transgressions overseen by the Supreme Perfected within the Three Realms and the lands of the ten directions. On each of the Three Primordial evenings, the green and black registers are inscribed and presented to the Upper Palace. All are delivered according to the depth of their sins or blessings, and retribution is meted out in accordance with the weight of their karma, without distinction between humans and celestials.\n\nAll you sentient beings must recite this scripture, maintain reverent offerings of incense and flowers, and make various devotions. Then shall your calamities be forever dispelled, your blessings swell like the vast sea, your grievances and disputes cease to assail you, and both the living and the dead attain peace.\n\nI shall now, for all good and faithful men and women within the great thousandfold world and the lands of the ten directions, repent all sins and cause them to be wholly eradicated, so that no evil retribution remains.\n\nRepent the sin of good men and women who do not believe in the sacred Dao and scriptures, harboring doubts and divided hearts.\nRepent the sin of disciples who slight the sacred Dao and sacred texts, criticizing and debating the scriptures.\nRepent the sin of disciples who steal, deface, or disrespectfully handle images of the Dao and scriptures, or who receive and uphold them without reverence for their masters and lineages.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, without a master, self-transmit the Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods and teach them to disciples.\nRepent the sin of disciples who slight their masters, violating their vows and pledges.\nRepent the sin of disciples who slander their masters, failing to honor the celestial principles.\nRepent the sin of disciples who conceal and obstruct the scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns, preventing their circulation.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, having obtained immortal scriptures and wondrous methods, recklessly transmit them to unworthy recipients.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, upon receiving scriptures and methods, do not adhere to the precepts, carelessly divulging sacred texts.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, after transmitting scriptures, do not honor their masters’ agreements.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, after receiving scriptures, fail to deliver all sentient beings.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, without cause, destroy or deface images, scriptures, or ritual objects of the Primordial Mysterious Dao.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, in transmitting scriptures and methods, do not first memorialize the heavens, swear oaths to the Five Emperors and Three Officials, or follow proper protocols.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, after receiving scriptures, lack faith and reverence, belittling the Dao and slighting their masters.\nRepent the sin of disciples who obstruct the paths of the sacred Dao, preventing its universal spread, seeking personal fame.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, on the days of the new moon, full moon, and eight festivals, do not pay respects to their masters and teachers, acting with arrogance.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, on days of fasting and vigil, do not maintain pure incense and offerings, failing to act for the sake of all beings.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, in reciting scriptures, skip passages, lack compassion for beings, and boast of their own cleverness.\nRepent the sin of those who study the supreme Dao but act out of order, competing for merit and fame.\nRepent the sin of disciples who, after receiving the Dao, encounter misfortune in their families but do not reflect on their own faults, instead blaming the Dao and resenting their masters.\nRepent the sin of disciples who slander good people, falsely accuse the sun and moon, belittle the sacred Dao, and honor heterodox teachings.\nRepent the sin of disciples who engage in double-tongued slander, drunken raving, and criticize the four assemblies.\nRepent the sin of disciples who indulge in greed, lust, and arrogance, defiling the true vehicle.\nRepent the sin of disciples who have cursed spirits, uttered frivolous words, or killed living beings.\nRepent the sin of disciples who engage in licentious and impure acts, envy the worthy, resent the good, or steal others’ property.\nRepent the sin of disciples who deceive their masters, slight the Dao, or reveal immortal secrets.\nRepent the sin of disciples who slander scriptures, oppress beings, and do not follow the true Dao.\nRepent the sin of disciples who speak of others’ faults, seek personal fame, practice duplicity, conceal malice, slight immortals and sages, or boast of their own merit.\nRepent the sin of disciples who bully their fellow students, neglect beings, and cause them distress.\nRepent the sin of disciples who defile the Three Treasures, alter sacred instruments, measure sacred texts, call truth falsehood, honor heterodox teachings, slander the Great Vehicle, or cause the pure to act wickedly.\nRepent the sin of disciples who rely on wealth and power to damage sacred texts, deceive beings into suffering hardship, or envy and harm the worthy, preventing their safety.\nRepent the sin of disciples who destroy immortal abodes, call reality illusion, encroach on sacred lands, ally with evil, protect the strong, or damage altars and harm sacred precincts.\n\nSuch sins, upon hearing or reciting this sutra, shall all be extinguished.\n\nFurthermore, repent the sins of disciples from beginningless time until this day—those who have harmed the good and aided the wicked, benefited themselves at others’ expense, or restrained and struck beings, cutting off their grain and water. Repent the sins of those who, through public law, have deeply entangled themselves in criminal charges; who have set fires to mountains, harming all sentient beings; who have dried up streams and brooks, slaughtering insects and fish; who have severed springs, preventing their flow and moisture; who have severed others’ bonds of affection, causing them to be scorned, their kin torn apart; who have sought profit and fame at the expense of the good and kind; who have spread poison to kill sentient beings; who have exploited beings to enrich themselves; who have falsely interpreted scriptural meanings, failing to align with the sagely intent; who have slandered sacred texts, dismissing them as false; or who, failing to study the origins of the Three Caverns, have defiled the scriptures and images of the Three Clarities.\n\nSuch sins as these are boundless, as countless as the grains of dust, impossible to exhaust. They fall under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Officials’ Thirty-Six Bureaus, subject to the trials of the Wind and Blade.\n\nIf, within the ten directions’ worlds of fine dust and the great-thousand lands, all faithful men and women—from beginningless time until this day—along with their parents, siblings, and six kinds of kin, have committed such sins, let them but recite, transcribe, and distribute this sutra. The merit gained shall be immeasurable, their lifespan extended without end. All such sins, past and present, shall be extinguished, and all calamities and misfortunes shall be lifted.\n\nAt that time, the assembly of heavenly beings bowed their heads in reverence and practiced accordingly, intoning this verse:\n\nThe Primordial Celestial Origin,\nThe Supreme Dharma King,\nBestows grace upon the Three Realms,\nBlessings upon the Ten Directions.\nAll beings rely upon it,\nAll creatures find peace.\nThe Dharma’s sound flows and transforms,\nDelivering the living and the dead.\nThe Nine Dark Realms are liberated,\nThe Five Sufferings spared from woe.\nFrozen pools thaw,\nDarkness radiates light.\nRecite, uphold, and make offerings—\nBoundless fortune and blessings arise.\n\n*Upper Scroll of the Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primordial Precepts of the Most High and Most Mysterious, the Three Powers of the Jade Maiden*\n*Middle Scroll*\n\nThe Lady of the Supreme Mystery, the Azure Maiden, declares: The Middle Primordial Second-Rank Earth Official, the Pure Void Perfected Lord, oversees the left, right, and central Three Bureaus, comprising forty-two departments in total. The immortal officials of the Three Bureaus are all permeated with the primordial qi of cavernous emptiness, purity, and void; their palaces each span fifty million miles. Together, they govern the myriad deities and immortals of the Five Thearchs and Five Marchmounts. Among them, the immortal officials number ninety million in total.\n\nThey preside over the records of life and death for all good and evil men and women within the great thousandfold world and the lands of the ten directions. Karmic retribution, fortune and misfortune, the length of lifespan, wealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness—all are determined by the allotted span of years and months. Even the flying birds and running beasts of the world, all creatures that creep and swim, and every kind of living being—each has its time of transformation, following its destined limit. These matters are reported to the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace and await the celestial officials’ review of the registers.\n\nSome may undergo transformation, their forms altered according to their blessings, their retribution received in accord with their karma, each with its own span of years and months. If there are beings burdened by many karmic obstacles, whose actions bring no benefit, they should, with rare flowers, precious fruits, pure water, and fragrant incense, diligently and reverently beseech their master day and night, recite this scripture, perform rites for the Three Primordials, and report their merits on the eight seasonal nodes. Thus, their misfortunes shall be forever dispelled, and their names inscribed on golden tablets.\n\nThe merit of this scripture can cure all illnesses, dispel all sufferings, resolve calamities, eliminate all evils, gather a thousand blessings, bring a hundred fortunes, extend lifespan, and deliver those sunk in darkness. You, all beings, need only receive and uphold it to gain boundless blessings.\n\nNow, the positions of the immortal officials of the left, right, and central Three Bureaus and the forty-two departments are revealed. You, all beings, need only make offerings to them, and their merit in aiding the imprisoned spirits shall be inexhaustible. All should revere them with utmost sincerity.\n\nWith devoted hearts, take refuge in:\nThe Lady of the Supreme Mystery, the Azure Maiden—Immortal Official of the Middle Primordial Numinous Capital

Lady of the Supreme Mystery, the Azure Maiden—Immortal Official of the Middle Primordial Cold Night Department.\n\nThe forty-two departments of the right palace, established by the Lady of the Supreme Mystery, the Azure Maiden, belong to the Palace of Cavernous Emptiness and Purity. Each has its left, right, and central Three Bureaus. Each bureau has one examining official, one hundred twenty examining clerks, one thousand two hundred examining scholars, and twelve thousand examining soldiers. Together, they govern the divine persons of the Five Marchmounts, the earth sovereigns of the nine lands, the deities of the four quarters and eight directions, all immortal officials, and those who have attained the Dao among the learned adepts.\n\nThey also record the merits, transgressions, sins, and blessings of all faithful men and women. Those of great fortune are reviewed every three years; those of middling fortune, every nine years; and those of lesser fortune, every twenty-four years. Sins and blessings are both enacted, merits and transgressions equally recompensed. Their registers are sealed in the cavernous palaces of the Five Marchmounts and await the evenings of the Three Primordials, the days when the Three Officials gather in sacred assembly, and the nights of review. The upper review examines the limits of transformation for divine persons; the middle review examines the records of success and failure, advancement and retreat for all those cultivating the Dao within the great thousandfold world; the lower review examines the transformations and service limits of all ghosts and spirits within the Three Realms.\n\nMoreover, within the lands of the ten directions, in all mountains, rivers, cavernous grottoes, seas, earth, and stones, in all ancient trees and springs, whether dragons, unicorns, lions, peacocks, phoenixes, soft-shelled turtles, tortoises, fish, tigers, leopards, monkeys, apes, river deer, muntjacs, flood dragons, pythons, crows, pheasants, raccoon dogs, wolves, dogs, pigs, turtledoves, sparrows, rats, or any creatures that fly or walk, with scales or shells, camels, mules, elephants, horses, oxen, sheep, and the like—whether with four feet, two feet, many feet, or no feet, born from the womb or from eggs, dwelling in nests or earthen burrows, in deep waters or mud, leaning on ancient trees or springs, beside sacred altars, wells, or hearths, in hills or ancient tombs, or within old vessels and sacred altars—all these beings of various forms and appearances, the spirits of all manner of creatures, along with all demonic and spectral beings, may bring fortune among humans or disaster upon the world.\n\nAt the appointed time of destiny’s reckoning, all shall be examined and judged. Though these manifold kinds dwell in the world, their state is never fixed. Those who bring no harm to humans—when the time of scrutiny arrives—shall be transformed into human form. The span of their wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, shall be determined by the measure of their karmic deeds. But if any of these myriad kinds, while dwelling among humans, inflict harm and torment upon all beings, then at the hour of judgment they shall be made to change their forms and endure renewed suffering: cast as lowly beasts, or as base spirits, dying to traverse the Nine Dark Realms, with no hope of deliverance.\n\nShould any being exhort and guide their kin to transcribe this sutra, bestow it upon the people, and together recite it, their merit shall be boundless. In every life, they shall be comely in form, long in years, and their blessings shall extend to their descendants.\n\nThe Celestial Maiden Qing declares: Such immortal officials oversee the Three Realms and Nine Lands, the Five Peaks and Four Quarters, all beings—men and women alike—recording their good and evil deeds in the Azure and Black Registers. They note the karmic retribution of those due for salvation, the dates of their judgment, and the names of those yet unenlightened who bear the weight of their sins. All is recorded in accordance with the statutes of the Pure Void and submitted to the Upper Palace.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning addressed the celestial hosts, the perfected immortals of the ten directions, the sublime adepts, and the deities of the sun, moon, and stars: “From this day forth, on the Three Primordial Days, you shall descend to the Palace of Pure Void and Luminous Yang in the Northern Capital. There, you shall assemble to review the registers of all beings in the Nine Lands of the earth—recording their lives, deaths, merits, transgressions, and sins. Their fortunes and misfortunes shall be inscribed upon the Azure and Black Tablets of life and death. Every transformation of humans and spirits, every change of form among birds and fish, must be duly recorded and submitted to the Upper Palace.”\n\nThen, the celestial immortals, the stellar deities, the true spirits of the Five Peaks, Four Controllers, Five Emperors, and Eight Poles, the officials of the Three Realms, and all divine beings received their commands and pledged to obey.\n\nThe celestial hosts then addressed the Most High Lord: “When the Three Officials conduct their review of the registers, throughout the great thousand worlds and the lands of the ten directions, all beings—men and women, good and evil—shall have their lives, deaths, sins, and merits recorded in the Azure and Black Registers. Their deeds shall be weighed by the gravity of their offenses, and their fates determined accordingly. Those destined for rebirth shall be named in the Left Palace; those bound for immortality, in the Central Palace; and those doomed to die, in the Right Palace. The days and months of their merits, transgressions, lives, and deaths shall be recorded with utmost precision, leaving no room for error.\n\nIf any faithful man or woman, burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and beset by misfortune, should transcribe this sutra, bestow it upon others, and recite it together—or if they uphold it with devotion, offering incense, flowers, and various reverent offerings—their merit shall be boundless. All disasters shall be healed, karmic obstacles dissolved, and their lives prolonged. Blessings shall extend to both the living and the dead, and even the dragon spirits shall bear this grace. You, all beings, must heed my words: practice goodness and repent your transgressions.\n\nThroughout the ten directions, in the dust-mote worlds and the great thousand lands, all faithful men and women—from time immemorial to this very day—may have committed the following sins:\n\nUsing unworthy men for unjust purposes, or the sin of vain and deceitful speech.\nGreedily amassing wealth for oneself, insatiable and unfulfilled.\nHoarding treasures and still coveting more.\nLuring the virtuous into evil deeds.\nWishing harm upon the kind and causing their ruin or dispersal.\nDestroying or defacing the sacred scriptures of the Great Cavern and holy images.\nSlaughtering beings for one’s own pleasure.\nShooting or hunting wild beasts, birds, and creatures.\nBurning mountains to capture prey, killing all living things.\nUsing gold, silver, or rare treasures for dining vessels without shame.\nSuccumbing to desire and wantonly taking lives.\nBurning or destroying sacred altars, immortal abodes, revered images, and scriptures.\nDiscarding food into filth.\nIndulging in rich, impure flavors, gluttonous and insatiable.\nConsuming the Five Pungent Herbs, defiling the Dao and the immortals.\nWillfully distorting scriptures, disregarding sacred texts.\nGathering crowds to kill living beings.\nPlotting against the kind, scheming against their kin, spouses, or children.\nBetraying one’s lord and scheming against the land.\nSlandering the true scriptures and sacred texts of the Great Dao.\nExchanging coarse goods for fine ones.\nDefacing the images of the Most High Lord, true immortals, or jade maidens.\nPointing at stars and recklessly predicting fortune or misfortune.\nBurning the storehouses, homes, and dwellings of beings.\nFelling trees, flowers, or fruits in sacred groves or immortal abodes.\nConsorting with evil men and slandering the virtuous.\nSlandering the sacred Dao and its scriptures, falsely distinguishing their weight.\nMisinterpreting profound mysteries, distorting scriptural meaning, and misrepresenting the sacred will.\nClinging to barbarian sorcery and slandering the Great Vehicle of the sacred Dao.\nRecklessly wandering the world, mocking the Three Treasures.\nPraising others to their faces while harboring deceit in their hearts.\nFalsely speaking ill of superiors, lacking filial piety.\nRevealing the secret arts of immortals or sacred texts.\nAttacking the virtuous without cause.\"\n\nOr relying on power and influence to deceive and cheat the common people—such is the sin.\nOr abusing power to oppress the virtuous, the poor, and the vulnerable—such is the sin.\nOr recklessly composing scriptures and treatises to slander the profound and primordial sacred Dao—such is the sin.\nOr fabricating false texts to defame the celestial patterns and heavenly perfected—such is the sin.\nOr teaching the ignorant to commit all manner of unwholesome deeds—such is the sin.\nOr exalting oneself in arrogance and indolence, belittling teachers, friends, and all beings—such is the sin.\nOr exploiting public law to settle private grudges—such is the sin.\nOr without cause, severing bonds with beloved parents, spouses, children, siblings, and kin—such is the sin.\nOr without cause, causing miscarriage or harm to the unborn—such is the sin.\nOr betraying clan and kin through lustful desires—such is the sin.\nOr poisoning waters to kill all creatures—fish, insects, and scaled beings—such is the sin.\nOr without cause, inciting strife among beings, sowing enmity and resentment—such is the sin.\nOr without cause, gathering multitudes to stir up demonic and perverse influences—such is the sin.\nOr recklessly submitting petitions and schemes to slander the Three Caverns and the Great Vehicle’s true principles—such is the sin.\nOr counterfeiting scriptures to falsely expound the sacred Dao of emptiness—such is the sin.\nOr practicing sorcery to swindle beings of their wealth—such is the sin.\nOr misleading the virtuous to engage in demonic and perverse acts—such is the sin.\nOr making unjust distinctions in the Way, wrongfully oppressing the common people—such is the sin.\nOr despising the aged and the unsightly, bullying the poor and the sick—such is the sin.\nOr pointing falsehood as truth, and perversity as uprightness—such is the sin.\nOr relying on power to intimidate and oppress all beings—such is the sin.\nOr allying with wicked factions to undermine the virtuous—such is the sin.\nOr envying and harming those superior to oneself, seeking to ruin the wise and virtuous—such is the sin.\n\nNow, for all you beings, I have expounded these sins as above. All such transgressions fall under the scrutiny of the Three Primordials’ divine clerks and immortal officials. Throughout the great thousandfold world, within the lands of the ten directions, all learned and virtuous men and women of faith—from beginningless time until this very day—who have violated the aforementioned sins: now, within this ritual arena, recite this scripture, repent fully, and beseech the complete eradication of all offenses.\n\nThe Lady of Azure says: The merit of this scripture can deliver those sunk in darkness, dissolve all evils, dispel unjust suffering, extinguish all □ wickedness, remove all afflictions, resolve enmity, avert misfortune, augment blessings and longevity, and benefit the world beyond measure. If any being upholds and recites this scripture, their fortune shall be as vast as the great ocean, their salvific power boundless, and their praise as infinite as the dust of the earth. You, all beings, should but diligently recite this scripture with reverence, prepare offerings of incense, flowers, and myriad gifts—throughout all lives, you shall gain immeasurable blessings, enjoy prosperity in every generation, and your virtue shall extend to both the living and the deceased. The merit of this scripture, benefiting humans and gods alike, brings blessings without limit.\n\nAnd it proclaims in verse:\nThe wondrous Dao of the August Void, physician of the Three Realms,\nNurtures heaven and earth, exhales and inhales yin and yang.\nIts majesty governs the myriad heavens, its blessings extend to the ten directions.\nParent of all beings, its radiance endures through kalpas.\nResplendent in the vast expanse, no speck or mustard seed escapes its light.\nThe Nine Dark Realms find deliverance, the Five Sufferings are cooled.\nThe medicine of life and death, it rescues both the living and the dead.\nThose who uphold and recite this scripture shall know boundless fortune and longevity.\n\n*Scripture of the Most High and Most Mysterious Lady of Azure on the Three Primordials’ Precepts for Removing Sins, Middle Scroll*\n*Lower Scroll*\n\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure of the Great Mystery states:\n\nThe Three Grades of the Lower Primordial’s Water Officials are the qi of the Cavernous Primordial’s wind and marsh, the essence of the Vast Dawn. The Three Officials of the Lower Primordial are named: the Palace of the Cavernous Source of Yang Valley, the Palace of Azure Radiance, and the Palace of the Frigid Night. Together, they govern the Nine Yangtze Water Lords, the Twelve Stream Nymphs, the Three Rivers and Four Seas Water Courts, the Dongting Lake within the river sources, and all aquatic beings—fish, dragons, jiao-serpents, shen-clams, the hundred spirits, scaled creatures, and the multitudes of damp-dwelling beings. Within the great chiliocosm, across the ten directions and all lands, they oversee the registers of life and death, the allotted spans of years and months, and the causes of karmic retribution for all faithful men and women. Their official retinue numbers ninety million in total.\n\nMoreover, there are the Three Courts of the Lower Primordial—left, right, and center. The left is named Clear Source, the right Frigid Night, and the center Pure Numinosity. These Three Courts comprise forty-two bureaus in all, collectively managing the records of good and evil, life and death, the weighing of sins and blessings, and the examination of allotted spans for humanity. Let all devotees revere them with utmost sincerity.\n\nWith sincere hearts, they pay homage to:\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Luminous Water Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Clear Water Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Arrayed Fire Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Three Luminaries Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Judgment Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Water Mandate Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Luminous Model Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Cavernous Source Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Kalpa-Verdict Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Water-Compliance Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Cavernous Yang Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Opportunity Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Examination Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Dragon Stable Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Luminous Kalpa Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Mechanism-Age Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Water-Brahma Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Sin-and-Blessing Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Judgment-Assembly Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Qi-Compliance Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Spirit-Seizing Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Dragon-Summoning Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Valiant Women Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Enlightened Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Soul-Liberation Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Essence-Examination Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Pure Rectitude Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Nine Rivers Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Northern Primordial Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Rectification Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Nine Disciplines Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Four Poles Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Dark Night Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Long Kalpa Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Suffering Spirits Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Three Tribulations Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Five Dharmas Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Myriad Verdicts Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Dark Waves Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Boundless Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Poisoned Blade Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, Immortal Official of the Long Night Bureau of the Lower Primordial.\n\nThese forty-two bureaus, established by the Most Mysterious Lady of Azure, belong to the left, right, and central courts of the Yang Valley Cavernous Source, where the trials of the Wind Blade are conducted. They collectively govern the Nine Yangtze Rivers, Three Rivers, and Four Seas Water Courts, the accumulated souls of the dead from the long night, the penal servitude of kalpas, and the affairs of the hundred ghosts and myriad spirits—all those whose names are destined for death. Within the ten directions of the world, they oversee the registers of merit and transgression, life and death, and the karmic ledgers of all good and evil men and women. They also manage the affairs of the myriad aquatic spirits, jiao-dragons, and the disasters of streams and valleys, determining the timing of great kalpic assemblies for liberation, and the weighing of merits and transgressions.\n\nTheir palaces span fifty million miles, suffused with the qi of wind-marsh vajra, and they govern all water sources—the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Ji Rivers—along with the affairs of the dark waves, the long night, the souls of the dead, and the spirits of ghosts. They also oversee the records of merits, sins, blessings, and retributions for all faithful men and women in the human realm, the allotted spans of karmic retribution, the tally of souls serving penal sentences, and the aquatic beings such as fish, dragons, and jiao-spirits. All await the day of the Three Officials’ examination of the registers, the night when the Five Emperors gather in sacred assembly, or the days of *jiǎzǐ* and *gēngshēn*, or the triennial and quinquennial festivals. On these occasions, the Nine Dark Realms’ courts are opened, the souls of the long night are examined, the spirits whose karmic debts are fulfilled are liberated, and the paths of humans and ghosts are distinguished.\n\nAll living beings, according to their blessings, receive rebirth; according to their karma, they receive retribution. In great and small kalpic assemblies, the azure and black tablets record and ascend to the Three Heavens, detailing merits, transgressions, sins, blessings, and the karmic conditions of life and death. Those destined for life are recorded in the left court; those destined for immortality, in the central court; and those destined for death, in the right court. The affairs of the myriad aquatic spirits are likewise managed, with the Three Grades inheriting the records of life, death, sins, blessings, merits, and transgressions, examining and tallying the allotted spans, each according to their deeds, all meticulously inscribed.\n\nMoreover, within the ten directions of the world and the great chiliocosm of lands, if there are virtuous scholars and all sentient beings who repent for transgressions committed since time immemorial—whether they have harbored anger toward fellow disciples, falsely accused the virtuous, or nurtured a poisonous nature, failing to release life and liberate the dead; or whether, having attained wealth and nobility, they have forgotten their teachers’ kindness—\n\nOr on the fast days of the myriad heavens, failing to turn the mind toward goodness. Or having raged against and slandered masters and teachers, engaging in unjust debates. Or mocking those who revere the Dao of the Mysterious Origin. Or urging others to commit all manner of evil deeds. Or forbidding others from performing virtuous acts. Or delighting in others’ faults, or wishing their successes to fail. Or turning away from the sagely Dao and the stars of the heavens, or defiling the Five Peaks and Nine Rivers. Or seizing what the virtuous desire. Or wantonly seeking worldly treasures. Or speaking falsehoods to deceive sentient beings. Or claiming others’ merits as one’s own. Or recklessly disturbing sentient beings, causing them to suffer peril. Or hunting and pursuing birds, fish, and wild beasts, leaving them no peace. Or terrifying the poor and sick, depriving them of joy. Or arrogantly belittling officials, boasting of one’s own merits. Or debating right and wrong unjustly. Or recklessly predicting the rise and fall of nations. Or lacking wisdom, clinging to petty teachings, and making arbitrary distinctions. Or defaming the sacred texts of the Great Dao and all divine images. Or indulging in unrestrained wandering. Or ascending to high rank and scorning those below. Or setting nets to slaughter birds and fish. Or destroying others’ households, scattering their families. Or stripping wayfarers of their clothing. Or extorting others’ wealth. Or after receiving the Dao, bowing to ghosts and spirits. Or baring one’s body before the Three Treasures. Or cursing the wind and rain, disrespecting the Three Luminaries. Or abusing power to borrow without repayment. Or harming creatures for glory, indulging in greed without restraint. Or scorning the celestial bodies and slighting the Heavenly Worthies. Or encroaching upon and deceiving one’s elders and superiors, deceiving rulers and lords. Or urging others to be unfilial, estranging parents and siblings from their kin. Or trusting in heterodox illusions and slandering the Mysterious Origin. Or lacking a master’s instruction and deceiving gods and humans. Or hoarding surplus clothing and food without aiding the poor and sick. Or stealing and defacing scriptures, erasing sacred texts. Or adorning garments with excessive splendor. Or wearing unclean clothes while ascending the high seat. Or defiling the master’s abode without reverence. Or failing to assist when masters and friends are grieving. Or abandoning scriptures and scorning the Dharma, belittling oneself. Or chasing after the powerful and ignoring the poor. Or failing to personally attend to a master’s illness. Or seeing the sick and not offering compassionate aid. Or entering and leaving the Dao’s gate without burning incense. Or entering the immortal hall and turning to laugh and speak. Or when invited to a fast, failing to transfer merit to the Three Officials. Or enjoying wealth and prosperity without thinking of the poor and elderly. Or when family members fall ill, blaming the Dao and cursing the master. Or receiving offerings without shame. Or transmitting the Dao’s teachings while violating vows and disrespecting masters and teachers. Or on the Three Primordial Days, failing to give thanks to the Five Emperors and Three Officials. Or on the Ten Straight Days, failing to cultivate good thoughts.\n\nI now reveal to you, sentient beings, these manifold transgressions, as numerous as the sands, which even if expounded for kalpas without end, could not be exhausted. You, all sentient beings, wishing to eradicate the sins aforementioned, need only reverently recite this scripture, offer incense and flowers, and make various offerings. All calamities will vanish, all evils will dissolve, and life after life, your blessings will be inexhaustible. All these are examined and tallied by the Three Officials, Five Emperors, the Four Controllers of the Three Realms, and all the immortal officials, without error. You, those who have attained the Dao and those who have not, all sentient beings now dwelling in blessings, along with the records of life and death, karmic roots, merits, and transgressions—all are reported to the Three Heavens and proclaimed to the Five Emperors.\n\nOn the appointed Three Primordial Days, the Limitless Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directional Great Sages, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperor Lords, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Supreme Jade Void Perfected Jade Emperor, the Lords and Elders of the Limitless Great Dao, the Five Elderly Gods, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and all the Flying Heavenly Immortals and Perfected Ones, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Longevity Directors of Life and Death, the Recorders, the Executioners, the celestial sun, moon, and stars, and all the hosts of perfected beings—none will fail to arrive.\n\nIf within the Three Realms and the lands of the ten directions, there are faithful men and women who follow the rites of repentance on the Three Primordial Days and the ceremonies of the Seven Sages for extending life, burning fine incense, offering banners, flowers, and jeweled canopies, making various pure offerings to the myriad heavens, and reverently reciting this scripture, they will gain immeasurable blessings. If there are faithful men and women who read and recite this scripture, the Three Officials will commend their goodness, the Directors of Life will extend their years, their names will be inscribed in the Azure Register, and their sins will be erased from the Northern Capital’s archives. And it is proclaimed in praise:\n\nThe Orthodox Unity, wondrous Dao,\nRadiant and majestic Dharma King.\nBearing heaven and earth, engendering yin and yang.\nIn the Dragon Han, responding to the mandate, the Five Great Ones spread fragrance.\nThe Vermilion Clarity is proclaimed, the Nine Elders bestow blessings.\nAt the end of the Highest Sovereign’s kalpa, the divine treasures radiate light.\nCompassionately nurturing the myriad beings, rescuing the living and the dead.\nOpening the Nine Dark Realms, relieving the Five Sufferings.\nThe myriad spirits rely upon it, enjoying boundless blessings.\nRecite, uphold, and make offerings—blessings and fortune flourish afar.\n\nAt that time, the Dao Lord bowed and said: Your servant has heard that the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao constantly proclaims the true Dharma, revealing it to all beings, unfolding the transformation of great compassion, bestowing mercy upon the multitudes, enabling both the living and the dead to be saved, and the hidden and manifest to attain deliverance. May the sounds of the Dharma flow forth, broadly aiding the myriad heavens, so that the karmic conditions of kalpas without end never cease. The Orthodox Unity, wondrous Dao, bestows blessings upon the ten directions; the living and the dead receive grace, and both the living and the dead bear its kindness.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: All faithful men and women, since time without beginning, the primordial qi has continued unbroken, and through various rebirths, good and evil, fortune and misfortune, each arises from its root. It is neither heaven nor earth, nor is it human—it is precisely the mind. The mind is spirit.\n\nForms are not my possession, nor do names abide with me. That from which I am born arises from the void and spontaneity, coalescing qi to form this body. Thus, though I receive form, this form is not truly my form—it is but a temporary lodging, a manifest appearance. Therefore, those who attain the Dao are no longer bound to form.\n\nAll sentient beings suffer because they possess bodies. With a body come a hundred evils, and birth and death follow form. If one can align the mind with the true, the Dao will merge with it. When body and spirit are complete, one becomes a perfected person, returning to formlessness and accomplishing the Dao. No longer will there be suffering, nor death; the form will not perish to ashes, and the self will return to its origin.\n\nAll sentient beings—if their bodies commit a hundred evils, they must endure manifold sufferings and cannot yet return to life. These bodies of good and evil each have their karmic counterparts; how can blame be laid upon the unseen sages?\n\nIn the boundless worlds of all heavens, all sentient beings, you Daoist followers, should copy this scripture, distribute it, and recite it in turn. The merit of this scripture is inconceivable. Above, it resolves heavenly calamities; below, it delivers those in eternal night. The blessing of copying it aids life after life; the power of reciting it brings boundless wealth and nobility.\n\nAt that time, the celestial assembly—the Three Origins, Nine Bureaus, Five Emperors, Four Offices, and all perfected beings—bowed their heads in praise. From this moment onward, if within the ten directions of the world or the lands of the great chiliocosm there arise floods, droughts, or warfare, causing the people of a nation to suffer or perish, then in the northern gate of that land, or in a pure and secluded place, or within an ancient altar or purified chamber, establish a ritual site. Hang banners and images, perform grand offerings to the Five Stars and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and invoke the immortals of the Three Origins. I shall ensure that winds and rains come in season, that warfare subsides, that the king governs with the Dao, that the world knows great peace, and that the people enjoy abundance and joy.\n\nIf within a household many suffer illness, if the family dwells in misfortune, if curses or oppressions afflict them, if demonic forces bring harm, if pestilence strikes, if madness or wind disorders arise, if qi brings calamity, or if baleful stars descend disaster—then purify the home, set up images, burn incense, and reverently recite this scripture. All misfortunes will naturally be healed. Life after life, boundless blessings will be received. We, the celestial hosts, shall ever protect you.\n\nAll good men and women—wherever this scripture is reverently recited, wherever the mysterious images are enshrined—no disaster will remain unresolved, no misfortune will fail to be averted. Wishes will be fulfilled, and a hundred blessings will converge. You, all sentient beings, should follow these teachings.\n\nAt that time, the perfected beings bowed their heads and complied, then spoke this verse:\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Sovereign, Master of the Wuwei Teachings,\nEmbracing yin and exhaling yang, Father and Mother of Heaven and Earth.\nThrough the nine-nines of transformation, Ancestor of the Myriad Beings.\nThe ocean of wisdom, profound and clear; the wellspring of the Dharma, vast and boundless.\nMight governs the ten thousand heavens, pervading the Three Realms.\nAll categories of existence receive grace; all living things depend on this.\nPower aids without end, both the living and the dead find peace.\nImmersed in the mysterious workings, transcending all obstructions in darkness.\n\n*Tai Shang Tai Xuan Nü Qing San Yuan Pin Jie Ba Zui Miao Jing*, Scroll the Lower.",

Author unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Adapted and expanded from *The Scripture on the Merits and Gravity of the Three Primordials’ Precepts*. Three scrolls. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**Scroll One**\n\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden spoke: In the primordial Dragon Han kalpa, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao, upon the Three Heavens, expounded the great *Three Caverns* Dharma—*The Wondrous Scripture of the Three Primordials’ Precepts*—to the assembled host of celestial sages, perfected immortals of the ten directions, and boundless assemblies of great saints. At that time, the officials of the Three Realms and the divine immortals of the myriad heavens, numbering in the hundreds of millions, all gathered in solemn attendance, reverently listening to the Dharma-sound.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of Primordial Beginning addressed the great assembly, saying: \"I now broadly proclaim the wondrous Dharma of the Three Vehicles and the precious scriptures of the Three Caverns to all beings within and beyond the Three Realms. I open the path for humans and devas, descending in accord with conditions to receive the beings of the Lower Realm. In the latter age, men and women who do not hear the Dao and its teachings are wrongfully slain in great numbers, failing to complete their allotted years. This arises from the heavy karmic burdens and deep transgressions of humankind, who do not return to the true transformation, turning their backs on reality to follow falsehood, employing only perverse conduct. After death, their souls have no refuge, bound and lodged within the Fengdu Hell. When kalpas end and mountains crumble, they have no means of liberation.\n\nYou, all beings, shall throughout the great chiliocosm and the lands of the ten directions, teach all faithful men and women that from this day forward, they must recite *The Precious Scripture of the Three Primordials* and *The Wondrous Canon of the Jade Maiden*. The merit of this scripture ascends to deliver the heavenly beings and descends to succor those in the long night; its blessings are boundless, its grace sustaining the myriad existences. It spares one from the moment of life’s end, preventing the soul from entering Fengdu to suffer karmic retribution.\"\n\nAt that time, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord of the First Primordial’s Ninefold *Qi* Celestial Office, the talisman of extended life formed from the *qi* of the Beginning Yang, dwelt in the Palace of Seven Treasures of Primordial Yang within the Mysterious Capital, seated upon the Terrace of Azure Radiance in the Hall of Purple Mist, upon a throne of fivefold clouds and a couch of purple gold, leaning upon a table of azure jade, holding a scepter of green jasper. Divine immortals stood in ranks to his left and right, attending as guards.\n\nThe Palace of the Upper Primordial extended five thousand myriad *li* in length and breadth, entirely formed from the *qi* of the Mysterious Azure. It presides over the Supreme Lord of the Jade Void, the High Emperor of the Celestial Worthy of Spontaneous Perfection, the lords of the myriad heavens, the perfected immortals, as well as the rulers of nations, great ministers, empresses, imperial consorts, princes, crown princes, all officials and their families, and the people of the world—every distinction of nobility and baseness, transgression and blessing. The divine officials and bureaucrats therein are all constituted of spontaneous *qi*; unless one is a person of the Golden Portal whose name is recorded on the Jade Tablets of the attained Dao, none may behold it.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity Palace are the Three Bureaus of Left, Right, and Center. The Left Bureau governs the Office of Life, examined by the Fire Official of the Great Yang. The Right Bureau governs the Office of Death, examined by the Water Official of the Great Yin. The Central Bureau governs the Office of Life, Death, Transgression, and Blessing, examined by the Wind Blade. The Three Bureaus comprise thirty-six departments, each overseeing nine thousand myriad officials. On the evening of the Upper Primordial, they collectively examine the causes and karmic retributions of life, death, transgression, and blessing throughout the great chiliocosm and the lands of the ten directions. All beings should be reverent, each person respectful.\n\nWith sincere devotion, they pay homage to:\n\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Perfection Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supervisory Rectitude Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Brahma Conduct Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Numinous Pass Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Divine Prohibition Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Illuminating Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Divinity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Opening Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Jade Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Southern Upper Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Primordial Merit Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Three Numinosities Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Brahma Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Majestic Numinosity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Clarity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Proclaiming Majesty Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Constancy Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Capital Numinosity Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Ceremony Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Dharma Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Examination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Luminous Majesty Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Nine Capitals Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Rectifying Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Fourfold Illumination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Celestial Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Execution Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Celestial Covenant Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Dark Capital Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Majestic Ceremony Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Yin Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Lower Primordial Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supervisory Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Supreme Illumination Department of the Upper Primordial.\nThe Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, Celestial Official of the Numinous Supervision Department of the Upper Primordial.\n\nThe thirty-six Celestial Officials of the departments above are governed by the Perfected Person of the Most Mysterious Jade Maiden, subordinate to the Purple Tenuity Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Each department is staffed with one Examiner, one thousand two hundred Examining Clerks, twelve thousand Examining Soldiers, and one hundred twenty thousand Examining Scholars. Together, they oversee all beings in Heaven who have attained the Dao in past lives or have yet to attain it, those presently enjoying blessings, rulers and their ministers, celestial princes, empresses and imperial consorts, all officials and chief ministers, as well as devout men and women—recording their merits, transgressions, sins, and blessings, and assessing the karmic accounts and allotted lifespans.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month each year, the Celestial Official of the Upper Primordial, the Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord, reviews and evaluates the following across the great thousandfold world and the ten directions’ lands: from the celestial registers of gods and immortals’ ascents and descents, the astrological records of stellar influences over lands and their rise and fall; through the lifespans of rulers, worthy ministers, princes, and all beings; down to the transformations of fish, dragons, and all flying and crawling creatures—recording the years and months of their rebirths and demotions. Within the Three Paths and the Nine Departments, the names of those due for karmic retribution and the durations of their sentences are noted. Those deemed fit to be reborn as humans have their names erased from the registers of the Long Night’s Department and inscribed in the Left Palace. Those destined to become various kinds of demons, evil spirits, or ghosts have their sentences carved in the Right Palace, their names written in the Black Register, awaiting the fulfillment of their allotted time before being reborn in different forms, their rebirths varying according to the weight of their karma.\n\nAmong the sinful souls fated to become flying or crawling creatures, their forms are assigned based on the severity of their sins: some as jackals, wolves, tigers, or leopards; some as donkeys, horses, camels, or mules; some as oxen, sheep, geese, or ducks; some as chickens, dogs, turtledoves, or owls; some as river deer, muntjacs, foxes, or hares; some as sparrows, wagtails, flies, or insects; some as dung beetles, mantises, snakes, or rats; some as mole crickets, ants, mosquitoes, or horseflies; some as dust deer or qilin; some as soft-shelled turtles, alligators, tortoises, or giant turtles; some as flood dragons, mirages, cave-dwelling serpents, or water dragons; some as great whales or sea horses; some as conches, clams, insects, or fish; some as crows, pheasants, peacocks, or eagles; some as hawks, sparrowhawks, or flying leopards; some as toads, fleas, or lice; some as ants, centipedes, or millipedes; some as loaches, eels, or jellyfish; some as crabs, scorpions, or spiders; or as creatures of bizarre forms—birds, fish, flying beasts, or monstrous creatures. Such myriad beings may walk, fly, crawl, or sit; they may have many legs or none; they may be born from wombs or eggs; they may dwell in dry or wet places, in nests or burrows. With a hundred forms and a thousand transformations, their names cannot be fixed.\n\nSome dwell in ancient trees or strange rocks; some inhabit deep pools, marshes, or springs; some cling to earthen hills or rocky cliffs; some lurk in wells, stoves, ditches, or canals; some manifest as demons or monsters among humans. All these myriad creatures, burdened with karmic lives, await the fulfillment of their allotted time. On the night when the Celestial Officials review the registers, they are reborn according to their karma, rewarded according to their blessings, cycled through kalpas, and reborn or die according to their deeds. Good and evil follow conditions without distinction.\n\nIf devout men or women resolve to copy this scripture, distribute and recite it, offer incense, flowers, precious canopies, and make offerings to the Celestial Worthies, all their sins will be eradicated. Or, on the evenings of the Three Primordials, they may perform rites to thank the Celestial Worthies; or on the ten auspicious days, recite this scripture to gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: The merits of this scripture can resolve karmic grievances from a hundred lifetimes, erase sins from ten thousand kalpas, eliminate the transgressions of embodied existence, dispel unforeseen disasters, free one from the suffering of death and rebirth, and dissolve the hearts of all evils.\n\nAll beings from this day forward, if afflicted by official misfortune, illness, curses, or vengeful foes, should recite this scripture. If stricken by epidemics, pestilence, or possessed by ghosts and demons, they should hold and recite this scripture. If seeking to prosper in livelihood, venture into the sea for wealth, undertake construction, establish a home, or bury the dead, they should recite this scripture. If facing setbacks in career or demotion in office, or if traveling by boat and fearing waves, they should recite this scripture. To deliver the long-night-bound souls, rescue the suffering in darkness, resolve ancient calamities, and save those in hidden torment, they need only recite this scripture to gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nIf locusts, floods, wars, or rebellions arise, causing rulers distress and people to perish, one should establish a ritual arena in a pure place or an ancient altar within a sacred temple, hang banners and canopies, recite this scripture, light lamps, perform the Daoist walk, and hold a grand offering to the Five Stars and all celestial bodies. Then the land will be at peace, the times harmonious, the people prosperous; locusts and wars will naturally dissipate, and disasters of flood, drought, and wind will be averted.\n\nIf devout men or women suffer lifelong misfortune, weak fate, chronic illness, or incurable afflictions; if they repeatedly violate the law, endure years in shackles; if they are afflicted by madness or possessed by evil spirits—they should copy this scripture, distribute it among beings, and recite it together. For those who do so, all disasters will dissolve, all evils will vanish, their lifespans will be prolonged, and they will gain immeasurable blessings.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: All beings cycle through birth and death, their karmic retributions and blessings manifesting without the slightest error. All await the days of the Three Primordials and the nights when the Three Officials review the registers, determining their rebirths, wealth or poverty, paths as humans or ghosts, or forms as birds or beasts. Those destined for blessings have their names inscribed in the Left Palace and carved in the Left Department. Those fated to become ghosts or beasts have their names written in the Right Department and carved in the Right Palace, each awaiting the fulfillment of their allotted time.\n\nThe Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery states: All devout men and women who attain immortal names have their merits and transgressions recorded on jade tablets. Those who have fallen from ranks or await karmic retribution for sins and blessings are likewise recorded in the lifespan registers of the Purple Tenuity Palace. All are sealed in the Jade Cabinet of the Luminous Perfected of the Mysterious Capital, the White Department of the Upper Primordial Celestial Official. They await the days when the Three Officials gather the sages to determine the registers of gods and immortals’ ascents and descents, the depths of karmic conditions for good and evil men and women, the lengths of their lifespans, and the durations of their allotted times. Even the release of those in the Nine Dark Realms from the limits of life, death, sin, and blessing, and the cycles of birth, transformation, decline, and prosperity for all creatures, are recorded and presented to the Supreme Void Emperor Lord of the Dao on the day of the Upper Primordial.",

Those who bring no harm to humans—when the time of scrutiny arrives—shall be transformed into human form. The span of their wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, shall be determined by the measure of their karmic deeds. But if any of these myriad kinds, while dwelling among humans, inflict harm and torment upon all beings, then at the hour of judgment they shall be made to change their forms and endure renewed suffering: cast as lowly beasts, or as base spirits, dying to traverse the Nine Dark Realms, with no hope of deliverance.\n\nShould any being exhort and guide their kin to transcribe this sutra, bestow it upon the people, and together recite it, their merit shall be boundless. In every life, they shall be comely in form, long in years, and their blessings shall extend to their descendants.\n\nThe Celestial Maiden Qing declares: Such immortal officials oversee the Three Realms and Nine Lands, the Five Peaks and Four Quarters, all beings—men and women alike—recording their good and evil deeds in the Azure and Black Registers. They note the karmic retribution of those due for salvation, the dates of their judgment, and the names of those yet unenlightened who bear the weight of their sins. All is recorded in accordance with the statutes of the Pure Void and submitted to the Upper Palace.\n\nThen, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning addressed the celestial hosts, the perfected immortals of the ten directions, the sublime adepts, and the deities of the sun, moon, and stars: “From this day forth, on the Three Primordial Days, you shall descend to the Palace of Pure Void and Luminous Yang in the Northern Capital. There, you shall assemble to review the registers of all beings in the Nine Lands of the earth—recording their lives, deaths, merits, transgressions, and sins. Their fortunes and misfortunes shall be inscribed upon the Azure and Black Tablets of life and death. Every transformation of humans and spirits, every change of form among birds and fish, must be duly recorded and submitted to the Upper Palace.”\n\nThen, the celestial immortals, the stellar deities, the true spirits of the Five Peaks, Four Controllers, Five Emperors, and Eight Poles, the officials of the Three Realms, and all divine beings received their commands and pledged to obey.\n\nThe celestial hosts then addressed the Most High Lord: “When the Three Officials conduct their review of the registers, throughout the great thousand worlds and the lands of the ten directions, all beings—men and women, good and evil—shall have their lives, deaths, sins, and merits recorded in the Azure and Black Registers. Their deeds shall be weighed by the gravity of their offenses, and their fates determined accordingly. Those destined for rebirth shall be named in the Left Palace; those bound for immortality, in the Central Palace; and those doomed to die, in the Right Palace. The days and months of their merits, transgressions, lives, and deaths shall be recorded with utmost precision, leaving no room for error.\n\nIf any faithful man or woman, burdened by heavy karmic obstacles and beset by misfortune, should transcribe this sutra, bestow it upon others, and recite it together—or if they uphold it with devotion, offering incense, flowers, and various reverent offerings—their merit shall be boundless. All disasters shall be healed, karmic obstacles dissolved, and their lives prolonged. Blessings shall extend to both the living and the dead, and even the dragon spirits shall bear this grace. You, all beings, must heed my words: practice goodness and repent your transgressions.\n\nThroughout the ten directions, in the dust-mote worlds and the great thousand lands, all faithful men and women—from time immemorial to this very day—may have committed the following sins:\n\nUsing unworthy men for unjust purposes, or the sin of vain and deceitful speech.\nGreedily amassing wealth for oneself, insatiable and unfulfilled.\nHoarding treasures and still coveting more.\nLuring the virtuous into evil deeds.\nWishing harm upon the kind and causing their ruin or dispersal.\nDestroying or defacing the sacred scriptures of the Great Cavern and holy images.\nSlaughtering beings for one’s own pleasure.\nShooting or hunting wild beasts, birds, and creatures.\nBurning mountains to capture prey, killing all living things.\nUsing gold, silver, or rare treasures for dining vessels without shame.\nSuccumbing to desire and wantonly taking lives.\nBurning or destroying sacred altars, immortal abodes, revered images, and scriptures.\nDiscarding food into filth.\nIndulging in rich, impure flavors, gluttonous and insatiable.\nConsuming the Five Pungent Herbs, defiling the Dao and the immortals.\nWillfully distorting scriptures, disregarding sacred texts.\nGathering crowds to kill living beings.\nPlotting against the kind, scheming against their kin, spouses, or children.\nBetraying one’s lord and scheming against the land.\nSlandering the true scriptures and sacred texts of the Great Dao.\nExchanging coarse goods for fine ones.\nDefacing the images of the Most High Lord, true immortals, or jade maidens.\nPointing at stars and recklessly predicting fortune or misfortune.\nBurning the storehouses, homes, and dwellings of beings.\nFelling trees, flowers, or fruits in sacred groves or immortal abodes.\nConsorting with evil men and slandering the virtuous.\nSlandering the sacred Dao and its scriptures, falsely distinguishing their weight.\nMisinterpreting profound mysteries, distorting scriptural meaning, and misrepresenting the sacred will.\nClinging to barbarian sorcery and slandering the Great Vehicle of the sacred Dao.\nRecklessly wandering the world, mocking the Three Treasures.\nPraising others to their faces while harboring deceit in their hearts.\nFalsely speaking ill of superiors, lacking filial piety.\nRevealing the secret arts of immortals or sacred texts.\nAttacking the virtuous without cause.\"",

You, all sentient beings, wishing to eradicate the sins aforementioned, need only reverently recite this scripture, offer incense and flowers, and make various offerings. All calamities will vanish, all evils will dissolve, and life after life, your blessings will be inexhaustible. All these are examined and tallied by the Three Officials, Five Emperors, the Four Controllers of the Three Realms, and all the immortal officials, without error. You, those who have attained the Dao and those who have not, all sentient beings now dwelling in blessings, along with the records of life and death, karmic roots, merits, and transgressions—all are reported to the Three Heavens and proclaimed to the Five Emperors.\n\nOn the appointed Three Primordial Days, the Limitless Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directional Great Sages, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperor Lords, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Supreme Jade Void Perfected Jade Emperor, the Lords and Elders of the Limitless Great Dao, the Five Elderly Gods, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinous, Northern Perfected, and all the Flying Heavenly Immortals and Perfected Ones, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Longevity Directors of Life and Death, the Recorders, the Executioners, the celestial sun, moon, and stars, and all the hosts of perfected beings—none will fail to arrive.\n\nIf within the Three Realms and the lands of the ten directions, there are faithful men and women who follow the rites of repentance on the Three Primordial Days and the ceremonies of the Seven Sages for extending life, burning fine incense, offering banners, flowers, and jeweled canopies, making various pure offerings to the myriad heavens, and reverently reciting this scripture, they will gain immeasurable blessings. If there are faithful men and women who read and recite this scripture, the Three Officials will commend their goodness, the Directors of Life will extend their years, their names will be inscribed in the Azure Register, and their sins will be erased from the Northern Capital’s archives. And it is proclaimed in praise:\n\nThe Orthodox Unity, wondrous Dao,\nRadiant and majestic Dharma King.\nBearing heaven and earth, engendering yin and yang.\nIn the Dragon Han, responding to the mandate, the Five Great Ones spread fragrance.\nThe Vermilion Clarity is proclaimed, the Nine Elders bestow blessings.\nAt the end of the Highest Sovereign’s kalpa, the divine treasures radiate light.\nCompassionately nurturing the myriad beings, rescuing the living and the dead.\nOpening the Nine Dark Realms, relieving the Five Sufferings.\nThe myriad spirits rely upon it, enjoying boundless blessings.\nRecite, uphold, and make offerings—blessings and fortune flourish afar.\n\nAt that time, the Dao Lord bowed and said: Your servant has heard that the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao constantly proclaims the true Dharma, revealing it to all beings, unfolding the transformation of great compassion, bestowing mercy upon the multitudes, enabling both the living and the dead to be saved, and the hidden and manifest to attain deliverance. May the sounds of the Dharma flow forth, broadly aiding the myriad heavens, so that the karmic conditions of kalpas without end never cease. The Orthodox Unity, wondrous Dao, bestows blessings upon the ten directions; the living and the dead receive grace, and both the living and the dead bear its kindness.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: All faithful men and women, since time without beginning, the primordial qi has continued unbroken, and through various rebirths, good and evil, fortune and misfortune, each arises from its root.

Thus, though I receive form, this form is not truly my form—it is but a temporary lodging, a manifest appearance. Therefore, those who attain the Dao are no longer bound to form.\n\nAll sentient beings suffer because they possess bodies. With a body come a hundred evils, and birth and death follow form. If one can align the mind with the true, the Dao will merge with it. When body and spirit are complete, one becomes a perfected person, returning to formlessness and accomplishing the Dao. No longer will there be suffering, nor death; the form will not perish to ashes, and the self will return to its origin.\n\nAll sentient beings—if their bodies commit a hundred evils, they must endure manifold sufferings and cannot yet return to life. These bodies of good and evil each have their karmic counterparts; how can blame be laid upon the unseen sages?\n\nIn the boundless worlds of all heavens, all sentient beings, you Daoist followers, should copy this scripture, distribute it, and recite it in turn. The merit of this scripture is inconceivable. Above, it resolves heavenly calamities; below, it delivers those in eternal night. The blessing of copying it aids life after life; the power of reciting it brings boundless wealth and nobility.\n\nAt that time, the celestial assembly—the Three Origins, Nine Bureaus, Five Emperors, Four Offices, and all perfected beings—bowed their heads in praise.

Hang banners and images, perform grand offerings to the Five Stars and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and invoke the immortals of the Three Origins. I shall ensure that winds and rains come in season, that warfare subsides, that the king governs with the Dao, that the world knows great peace, and that the people enjoy abundance and joy.\n\nIf within a household many suffer illness, if the family dwells in misfortune, if curses or oppressions afflict them, if demonic forces bring harm, if pestilence strikes, if madness or wind disorders arise, if qi brings calamity, or if baleful stars descend disaster—then purify the home, set up images, burn incense, and reverently recite this scripture.
