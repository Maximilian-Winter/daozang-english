  "full_translation": "*The Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility*\n\n**Title:** *The Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility*. Originally titled *Liezi*. Traditionally attributed to Lie Yukou of the Warring States period, though some contend it was forged by a scholar of the Wei-Jin era. During the Tang dynasty, it was revered as one of the Four True Scriptures of Daoism. Comprising three scrolls.\n\n**Source Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n**Collated Edition:** *Sibu Congkan* facsimile of the Northern Song printed edition held in the Tieqin Tongjian Library of the Qu family of Changshu (hereafter referred to as the *Northern Song Edition*).\n\n---\n\n### *The Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility*\n**Liezi**\n\nLiezi, surnamed Lie, given name Yukou, was a native of Zheng. He dwelt in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none recognized him. Initially, he served Huqiuzi, later became a disciple of Old Master Shang, and befriended Bogaozi. Having mastered the Way of these two masters, after nine years he could ride the wind and travel as one with it.\n\nHis disciple Yan Hui asked: \"Those who seek the Way—do they do so for wealth?\"\nLiezi replied: \"Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Way, and thus perished.\"\n\nThe text comprises eight chapters in total. Liezi was doubtless a man of the Dao, and Zhuangzi frequently praised him. Today, the Liezi Temple in Bianliang, Zhengzhou, and Putian stands upon the site of his former retreat. During the Tang dynasty, he was enfeoffed as the Perfected One of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility, and his work was titled *The Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility*.\n\n---\n\n### *The Scripture of Perfect Virtue in Emptiness and Tranquility*\n**Scroll One**\n**Chapter One: Heavenly Portents**\n\nLiezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk. When the state’s resources grew insufficient, he prepared to depart for Wei. His disciples said: \"Master, once you go, there will be no set time for your return. If we, your disciples, have matters to present, what teachings will you leave us?\" Liezi replied: \"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\" Then he smiled and said: \"What did Master Hu say? Still, our teacher once spoke of this to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing and will now tell it to you. He said: There is that which is born yet not born, and that which transforms yet does not transform. That which is not born can give birth to the born, and that which does not transform can bring about transformation. The born cannot but be born, and the transformed cannot but be transformed—thus there is constant birth and constant transformation. In constant birth and constant transformation, there is no time when there is not birth, no time when there is not transformation. This is but yin and yang, this is but the four seasons. That which is not born is solitary and unchanging, while that which does not transform moves to and fro. Their meeting point cannot be exhausted; the solitary and unchanging Way cannot be fathomed.\"\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and seemingly present, its use is inexhaustible.\" Thus, that which gives life to things does not itself live, and that which transforms things does not itself transform. Things are self-born, self-transforming, self-formed, self-colored, self-knowing, self-powered, self-dissolving, and self-ceasing. To speak of them as born and transformed, formed and colored, knowing and powered, dissolving and ceasing—this is not so.\n\nLiezi said: \"Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to govern Heaven and Earth. If the formed are born from the formless, then from whence do Heaven and Earth arise?\" Thus it is said: There is the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Inception, and the Supreme Plainness. The Supreme Simplicity is the time before qi is seen; the Supreme Beginning is the beginning of qi; the Supreme Inception is the beginning of form; the Supreme Plainness is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated, this is called the Primal Chaos. \"Primal Chaos\" means that the myriad things are intermingled and not yet separated. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—thus it is called the Supreme Simplicity. The Supreme Simplicity has no form, yet it transforms into the One. The One transforms into the Seven, and the Seven transform into the Nine. The Nine is the limit of transformation, after which it returns to the One. The One is the beginning of the transformation of form. The clear and light rise to become Heaven, the turbid and heavy sink to become Earth, and the harmonious qi between them becomes Man. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.\n\nLiezi said: \"Heaven and Earth have no complete achievements, the sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses. Thus, Heaven’s duty is to cover and give life, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things have their proper functions. Yet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations, and things have their penetrations. Why is this so? That which gives life and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot violate what is proper; and that which is proper is fixed and does not overstep its position. Thus, the Way of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the proper functions of the myriad things are either softness or hardness. All these follow what is proper and cannot overstep their positions.\n\nThus, there are the born, and there are those that give birth to the born; there are the formed, and there are those that give form to the formed; there are the sounding, and there are those that give sound to the sounding; there are the colored, and there are those that give color to the colored; there are the flavored, and there are those that give flavor to the flavored. The born that are born die, yet those that give birth to the born never end; the formed that are formed are solid, yet those that give form to the formed never exist; the sounding that are sounded are heard, yet those that give sound to the sounding never emit; the colored that are colored are manifest, yet those that give color to the colored never appear; the flavored that are flavored are tasted, yet those that give flavor to the flavored never present themselves. All these are the functions of non-action.\n\nThey can be yin or yang, soft or hard, short or long, round or square, alive or dead, hot or cold, floating or sinking, gong or shang, emerging or submerging, black or yellow, sweet or bitter, rank or fragrant. They have no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing they do not know, nothing they cannot do.\"\n\nLiezi traveled to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, overgrown with brambles, and pointed to it. Turning to his disciple Baifeng, he said: \"Only you and that skull know that we have never been born and never died. Has this been an excess of nurture? An excess of joy?\"\n\nThere are countless transformations of species: when a frog becomes a quail, it may turn into a water leech in water, or into the mossy coat of a frog or toad at the water’s edge. Born on a mound, it becomes *lingxi*. *Lingxi* that finds decaying mulberry becomes crow’s foot. The root of crow’s foot becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in time, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, called *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The froth of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixilu*. *Shixilu* gives rise to *shixihuangxu*, and *shixihuangxu* to *jiuyou*. *Jiuyou* gives rise to *maorui*, and *maorui* to *fuxuan*. A sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*, horse blood into *zhuanlin*, human blood into wildfire. The sparrowhawk becomes the kestrel, the kestrel the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes a clam, the field mouse a quail, the *wuzhao* a fish, old leeks *xian*, old rams monkeys, and fish roe *gu*. The beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born from a gaze and called *yi*. The creature named *dayao* is purely female, while *zhifeng* is purely male. A lovesick scholar, though unwed, may be moved to conception; a lovesick maiden, though husbandless, may conceive. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint, Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry, Jue Zhao from dampness, and the wine midge from wine. When *yangxi* pairs with the unbudding bamboo, the long bamboo gives rise to *qingning*. *Qingning* gives rise to *cheng*, *cheng* to the horse, the horse to man, and man in time returns to the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Book* says: When form moves, it does not produce form but shadow; when sound moves, it does not produce sound but echo. Non-movement does not produce non-being but gives rise to being. Form must inevitably end. Do heaven and earth also end? They end with me. Do they advance beyond ending? I do not know. The Dao ends in what has no beginning, advances in what has no duration. Having life, one returns to non-life; having form, one returns to the formless. That which does not live is not originally non-living; that which is formless is not originally formless. Life is what must inevitably end. Ending is what cannot but end, just as life cannot but begin. To desire the perpetuation of life and the completion of its end is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nSpirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh to earth’s. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and congeals. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—hence it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" returning to its true dwelling. The Yellow Emperor said: When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me?\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformations number four: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will unified, harmony at its utmost—things do not harm it, and virtue cannot surpass it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise in full, things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares for rest, things no longer precede it; though it does not attain the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses youth and prime. In death, one returns to stillness, reverting to the ultimate.\n\nConfucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe tied with a rope, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked: \"Master, what is the source of your joy?\" He replied: \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, and man is the most noble—this is my first joy. Among men and women, the male is honored and the female debased, so to be born a man is my second joy. Some do not live to see the sun and moon, never leaving swaddling clothes, but I have already reached ninety years—this is my third joy. Poverty is the scholar’s constant; death is man’s end. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end, what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent! He knows how to console himself.\"\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe and gleaned fallen grain in an old field, singing as he walked. When Confucius passed through Wei and saw him in the wilds, he turned to his disciples and said: \"That old man may be worth speaking to. Go and question him.\" Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of the ridge. Facing him, he sighed: \"Master, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning like this?\" Lin Lei walked on without pausing, his song unbroken. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, until at last he looked up and replied: \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said: \"In your youth, you did not strive; in your prime, you did not compete; in old age, you have no wife or children, and death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed: \"The source of my joy is what all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive; in my prime, I did not compete—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children, and death draws near—thus I can be so joyful.\" Zigong said: \"Longevity is man’s desire; death is man’s aversion. Why do you find joy in death?\" Lin Lei replied: \"Death and life are a going and a returning. Thus, one who dies here—how do we know he is not born there? So I know they are not the same, but how do I know that striving for life is not delusion? And how do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\" Zigong, not grasping his meaning, returned and reported this to the Master. The Master said: \"I knew he was one with whom one could speak—indeed, so it is. Yet he has attained this understanding without fully exhausting it.\"\n\nZigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a time.\"\nConfucius replied: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\nZigong asked: \"Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?\"\nConfucius said: \"You shall have rest—behold the grave-mound, so round, so smooth, so lofty, so firm. There you shall know your rest.\"\nZigong exclaimed: \"How great is death! The noble man finds rest therein; the petty man is laid low.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Ci, you have grasped it. Men all know the joy of life, yet do not know its sorrows; they know the weariness of old age, yet do not know its ease; they know the aversion to death, yet do not know death as rest.\"\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous find rest therein; the unvirtuous are laid low. Death is the full realization of virtue. The ancients called the dead 'those who have returned.' If the dead are called 'those who have returned,' then the living are 'those who are journeying.' To journey without knowing to return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the world loses its home, none know to condemn it. There are those who leave their native land, abandon their six relations, forsake their family estate, and wander the four quarters without returning—what manner of men are these? The world must call them mad and reckless. And there are those who prize worldly success, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves before the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are these? The world must call them wise and cunning. Both have lost their way, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject.\"\n\nSomeone asked Master Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\nLiezi replied: \"Emptiness is not to be valued.\"\nMaster Liezi said: \"It is not the name that matters—rather stillness, rather emptiness. In stillness and emptiness, one finds one’s proper place; in grasping and giving, one loses it. When affairs are shattered like stone and only then do men dance with benevolence and righteousness, it cannot be restored.\"\n\nZhou Xiong said: \"The turning ceaselessly revolves; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who perceives it? Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, completion and depletion, follow the world and follow death. Coming and going meet in succession, with no gap to spare—who perceives it? For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete all at once; one does not perceive its completion, nor its depletion. It is like a man from youth to old age—his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change day by day without pause. Skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing years, not remaining as they were in infancy. The change is imperceptible until later one knows. In the state of Qi, there was a man who fretted that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, so he forsook sleep and food. Another, worried for his worry, went to enlighten him, saying: 'Heaven is but an accumulation of qi—there is no place without qi. When you bend and stretch, breathe in and out, you move and rest all day within heaven. Why fear collapse?' The man said: 'If heaven is but an accumulation of qi, then the sun, moon, and stars should not fall?' The enlightener said: 'The sun, moon, and stars are also accumulations of qi, those with radiance within it. Even if they fell, they could do no harm.' The man said: 'What if the earth crumbles?' The enlightener said: 'The earth is but an accumulation of clods, filling the four voids—there is no place without clods. When you tread and step, you move and rest all day upon the earth. Why fear its crumbling?' The man was suddenly greatly relieved. The enlightener was also suddenly greatly relieved.\"\n\nMaster Changlu heard and laughed, saying: \"Rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, rain, and the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi forming heaven. Mountains, rivers, metals, stones, water, and fire—these are the accumulations of form constituting earth. Knowing that qi accumulates, knowing that clods accumulate—how can one say they do not crumble? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest within what has bounds. They are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. They are difficult to measure, difficult to know—this is certainly so. To worry about their crumbling is indeed too distant; to say they do not crumble is also incorrect. Heaven and earth cannot but crumble, and when they do, they will return to crumbling. When their time of crumbling comes, how can one not worry?\"\n\nMaster Liezi heard and laughed, saying: \"To say heaven and earth crumble is also mistaken; to say they do not crumble is also mistaken. Whether they crumble or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one state, this is another. Thus, the living do not know the dead; the dead do not know the living. Coming does not know going; going does not know coming. Whether they crumble or not, how can I concern myself?\"\n\nShun asked Zheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\"\nZheng replied: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\"\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\"\nZheng said: \"It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth. Thus, in action, you do not know where you go; in dwelling, you do not know what you hold; in eating, you do not know its purpose. Heaven and earth are the powerful yang, qi—how can they be possessed?\"\n\nIn Qi, the Guo family was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang family was immensely poor. The Xiang family went from Song to Qi to seek their method.\n\nThe Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in the art of thievery. When I first began as a thief, I had enough after one year, abundance after two, and great prosperity after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire province and villages.\" The Xiang family rejoiced greatly, understanding his words about thievery but not the Dao of thievery. They then scaled walls and broke into houses, taking whatever their hands and eyes reached. Before long, they were caught for their crimes and lost all their ancestral wealth. Believing the Guo family had deceived them, the Xiang family went to complain. The Guo family asked: \"How did you go about thievery?\" The Xiang family described what they had done. The Guo family exclaimed: \"Alas! Have you lost the Dao of thievery to such an extent? Now I will tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, and earth has its advantages. I steal heaven and earth’s seasons and advantages—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the produce of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, I steal from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven. How can they be mine? Thus, though I steal from heaven, I incur no misfortune. Gold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people amass—how can they be granted by heaven? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?\"\n\nThe Xiang family was deeply perplexed, thinking the Guo family was further deceiving them, and went to consult Master Dongguo. Master Dongguo said: \"Is not your very body a form of theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form—how much more so with external things? Truly, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To claim possession of them is delusion. The Guo family’s theft is the public Dao, so they incur no misfortune; your theft arises from private desire, so you are punished. Those with public and private motives are thieves; those without public and private motives are also thieves. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. Who can say what is theft and what is not?\"\n\n**Chapter Two: The Yellow Emperor**\n\nAfter fifteen years on the throne, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under heaven supported him. He nurtured his natural destiny, indulged his ears and eyes, and gratified his nose and mouth. His complexion withered, his skin darkened, and his senses grew dull. Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that all under heaven remained untamed. He exhausted his wisdom and strength, governing the people, yet his complexion withered further, his skin darkened, his brows furrowed, and his senses grew dull.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor sighed deeply and said: \"My excesses have gone too far. Nurturing myself alone brings such affliction; governing the myriad things brings such affliction.\" Thereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells, reduced his meals, and retired to dwell in the Hall of the Great Court. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, refraining from governance for three months.\n\nOne day, he fell into a daytime slumber and dreamed of wandering in the land of the Huaxu clan. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Province and north of Tai Province. It is unknown how many thousands of miles distant—beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot, accessible only in spirit. In that land, there are no rulers; all is spontaneous. The people have no desires; all is spontaneous. They do not delight in life nor fear death, so none die young. They do not favor themselves nor distance others, so there is no love or hate. They do not know opposition nor compliance, so there is no benefit or harm. They cherish nothing and fear nothing. They do not drown in water nor burn in fire. Cuts and blows cause no pain; pokes and scratches bring no itching. They tread the void as if on solid ground and sleep in emptiness as if on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their sight; thunder does not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not confuse their hearts; mountains and valleys do not hinder their steps. They move as spirits.\n\nAwakening, the Yellow Emperor felt joyful and at ease. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said: \"During my three months of retreat, I purified my heart and disciplined my form, seeking the Dao to nurture the self and govern things, but I found no method. Exhausted, I slept and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion.\"\n\nI have grasped it. I have attained it. Yet I cannot convey it to you.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the realm reached great order, nearly resembling the land of Huaxu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. The people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.\n\nMount Liegu on an island in the sea and river holds divine beings upon its summit. They drink the wind and sip the dew, partaking not of the five grains. Their hearts are like deep springs, their forms like maidens. They neither cling nor cherish, and immortals and sages serve as their ministers. They neither fear nor rage, and the honest and sincere act as their messengers. They neither bestow nor favor, yet all things are self-sufficient. They neither hoard nor gather, yet they themselves are without fault. Yin and yang remain ever harmonious, sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in constant order, wind and rain in perfect balance. Nurturing and breeding occur in due season, the harvest ever abundant. The land knows no blight, the people no premature death or misfortune. Things bear no blemish or pestilence, and ghosts emit no eerie sounds.\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Advancing in the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned home. Yin Sheng heard of this and followed Liezi, dwelling with him for months without returning home. He then asked repeatedly to learn the art of guarding his person, but after ten requests, Liezi refused ten times. Yin Sheng, vexed, sought to take his leave, yet Liezi gave no command. Yin Sheng withdrew.\n\nMonths later, his desire unabated, he returned again. Liezi said: \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied: \"Formerly, I made requests of you, but you did not answer me, leaving me resentful. Now, my resentment has dissolved, so I have returned.\" Liezi said: \"Before, I took you for one who understood, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji, I shall tell you what I learned from my master.\n\nSince I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. I received but a single glance from my master. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm. Then my master first relaxed his countenance and smiled. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations without right or wrong, my words flowed without profit or harm. Then my master first drew me to sit beside him on the mat. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in thought, my words flowed without restraint. I no longer knew whether my right and wrong, profit and harm were mine or another’s. Nor did I know whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends. Within and without, all had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes became like ears, my ears like nose, my nose like mouth—all were the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly fused. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a leaf or dry husk. Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind? Now you, dwelling at your master’s gate for barely a moment, have repeatedly harbored resentment. Your body’s fragments cannot bear the qi, your limbs cannot be borne by the earth. How can you hope to tread the void and ride the wind?\"\n\nYin Sheng was deeply ashamed. He held his breath for a long while and dared not speak again.\n\nLiezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks through emptiness without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one attain this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Ji, let me tell you. All things with form, image, sound, or color are merely objects. How can objects be far apart from one another? Why should one strive to surpass them? They are but appearances. Thus, things are created from the formless and come to rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how could they be corrected? They dwell in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and roam the beginning and end of the myriad things. They unify their nature, nurture their qi, embrace their virtue, and merge with the source of things. Such as these preserve their Heavenly endowment whole, their spirit unobstructed. How could things enter them?\n\nWhen a drunkard falls from a cart, though swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs. His spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding or falling. Life and death, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he encounters things without alarm. If one preserved whole by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved whole by Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\"\n\nLie Yukou shot arrows for Bo Hun Wu Ren. He drew the bow to its fullest, placed a cup of water on his elbow, and released. The arrows followed one after another, each fitting precisely into the nock of the previous. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss. Can you shoot then?\" Thereupon, Wu Ren climbed the high mountain, trod the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the abyss. Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge. Beckoning Lie Yukou forward, Lie Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat flowing to his heels. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: \"The perfected person gazes up to the azure sky, plunges down to the Yellow Springs, ranges to the eight directions—his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with the intent to fix your gaze. Your inner state is perilous indeed.\"\n\nThe Fan clan had a son named Zihua, skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state admired him. Favored by the Lord of Jin, he held no office yet ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state ennobled; whatever he spoke of, the state demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court’s retinue. Zihua employed his knights to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to overpower and humiliate each other. Though wounded and broken before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, and the state nearly became a custom.\n\nHesheng and Zibo, the foremost retainers of the Fan clan, were traveling together when they passed beyond the city walls and lodged at the cottage of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai. In the dead of night, the two men spoke of Zihua’s fame and influence—how he could make the living perish and the dead live again, turn the rich to poverty and the poor to wealth.\n\nShangqiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, had been eavesdropping from behind the north window. Seizing the chance, he borrowed provisions and a basket, then made his way to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding grand carriages, strolling with leisurely strides and haughty gazes. When they caught sight of Shangqiu Kai—aged, frail, his face darkened by soot, his clothes and cap in disarray—not one did not sneer. The attendants grew harsh, and soon the mockery turned to insults and deceit, pushing and shoving, jostling and striking—nothing was left undone. Yet Shangqiu Kai never showed the slightest resentment, while the others, exhausted by their own antics, grew weary of their sport.\n\nThen they all ascended a high terrace, and amidst the crowd, someone idly remarked: *\"Whoever can leap down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\"* The crowd clamored in response. Taking the words as truth, Shangqiu Kai leapt first, his body like a soaring bird, landing lightly on the ground—his bones unbroken, his flesh unharmed. The Fan clan’s faction dismissed it as mere chance and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext, they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: *\"There is a treasure pearl in those depths—dive, and you may retrieve it.\"* Shangqiu Kai dove in once more. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to murmur in doubt.\n\nZihua then ordered that Shangqiu Kai be given meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua declared: *\"Whoever can enter the flames and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.\"* Without hesitation, Shangqiu Kai went forward, entering and exiting the fire unscathed—no soot clung to him, his body was unburned. The Fan clan’s faction now believed him to possess the Dao, and together they apologized: *\"We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you. We did not know you were a spirit-man and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. Pray, tell us of your Way.\"*\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: *\"I possess no Dao. Even in my own heart, I do not know how this comes to be. Yet since there is this one thing, let me try to speak of it to you.\"*\n\nWhen you two guests lodged at my house before, I heard praise of the Fan clan’s power—how they could make the living perish and the dead live again, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed it without doubt, so I came without hesitation. Once here, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not whole enough, my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay. My heart was single, and all else vanished—it was as simple as that.\n\nNow I realize your faction deceived me. Within, I harbor suspicion; without, I strain to observe and listen. I recall with relief how I once emerged unscathed from fire and water, yet my heart burns with shame, and my body trembles in fear. How could I ever again approach water or fire?\n\nFrom then on, when the disciples of the Fan clan encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Do you not understand? A person of perfect sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, touch ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering fire and water? If Shangqiu Kai’s faith in falsehoods still met no resistance, how much more when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples.*\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a herdsman named Liang Yang, a lowly laborer who could tame wild birds and beasts. He scattered food in his garden and courtyard, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey grew docile. Males and females gathered before him, breeding and multiplying in groups. Different species lived together without attacking or biting one another.\n\nThe king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it from him. Liang Yang said: *\"I am but a humble servant—why should I guard this knowledge to pass on to you? I fear the king will think I am hiding something from you. Let me tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi are by nature pleased when obeyed and angered when opposed. Yet their joy and rage are not reckless—they arise only when provoked. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will kill in anger; nor whole prey, for it will tear it apart in fury. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its temper, and thus the tiger—though a different species—will fawn upon its keeper. To obey it is to please it; to oppose it is to provoke its killing. So how could I dare oppose it to anger it? Yet I do not obey it to please it either. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger often shifts to joy—neither is balanced. If my heart holds neither opposition nor compliance, then the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus those that roam my garden do not long for distant forests or open marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or hidden valleys. This is the principle at work.\"*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the abyss of Shangshen. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him: ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He said: ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught; skilled swimmers learn quickly. But as for divers—those who have never seen a boat yet instinctively master it.’ I asked him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"Ah! You and I have long pondered its words, yet we have not grasped its essence—could it truly be the Way? Those who can swim may be taught, for they are unburdened by water. Skilled swimmers master it swiftly, for they have forgotten water entirely. As for divers—those who have never seen a boat yet instinctively handle it—it is because they see the abyss as solid ground, and a capsized boat as merely their carriage rolling back. With ten thousand things arrayed before them, none can enter their dwelling—where could they not be at ease?\n\nOne who grasps with a clay tile does so skillfully; with a hook, cautiously; with gold, in confusion. The skill is the same, yet when one clings to externals, they become weighed down. And all who are weighed down by externals neglect what lies within.\"*\n\nConfucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and its froth stretched thirty *li*, a place where even soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and, thinking him in distress and seeking death, sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, hair unbound, singing as he strolled along the bank.\n\nConfucius followed and asked him: *\"The Lüliang Falls plunge thirty *ren*, and its froth stretches thirty *li*—a place where even soft-shelled turtles and alligators cannot swim. When I saw you entering it, I thought you were in despair and wished to die, so I sent my disciples along the current to save you. Yet you emerged, unbound your hair, and sang as you walked. I took you for a ghost, but upon closer look, you are a man. May I ask if there is a method to treading water?\"*\n\nThe man replied: *\"No, I have no method. I began with what was innate, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny. I enter the water with the current and emerge with the flow. I follow the Way of water without imposing my will—this is how I tread it.\"*\n\nConfucius asked: *\"What do you mean by ‘began with what was innate, grew with my nature, and fulfilled my destiny’?\"*\n\nThe man said: *\"I was born on land and am at ease on land—that is my beginning. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—that is my nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—that is my destiny.\"*\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback catching cicadas with a pole as effortlessly as if picking them up.\n\nConfucius said: *\"You are skillful indeed! Is there a method to this?\"*\n\nThe man replied: *\"I have a method.\"*\n\nIn the fifth or sixth month, if I stack pellets two or three deep without dropping them, I miss only a few; if I stack three, I miss one in ten; if I stack five, I catch cicadas as easily as picking them up. When I stand, I am as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a dry branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, I am aware only of cicada wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: *\"When the mind is undivided, it verges on the divine.\"*\n\nThe hunchbacked elder said: *\"You, a scholar in robes, what do you know of such things? First refine your own method, then you may speak of it further.\"*\n\nThere was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the shore and followed the gulls, and hundreds of them would come to him without cease. His father said: *\"I hear the gulls all follow you—catch some for me to play with.\"* The next day, when he went to the sea, the gulls danced above but would not land. Thus it is said: *\"Perfect words leave no trace; perfect action requires no effort.\"* What the clever know is but shallow.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand men to hunt in Mount Zhong, they set fire to the forest, fanning flames a hundred *li* wide. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghost. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched. The viscount detained him in wonder and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were human; his breath and voice were human. He asked: *\"By what way do you dwell in stone? By what way do you enter fire?\"* The man replied: *\"What do you call stone? What do you call fire?\"* The viscount said: *\"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"* The man said: *\"I do not know.\"*\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia: *\"What manner of man is he?\"* Zixia said: *\"From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one in perfect harmony with things cannot be harmed by them. Such a one may wander through metal and stone, tread water and fire—all is possible.\"* The marquis said: *\"Why do you not do this?\"* Zixia replied: *\"To hollow out the heart and discard knowledge—this I have not yet mastered. Still, I can speak of it when there is time.\"* The marquis said: *\"Why does the Master not do this?\"* Zixia said: *\"The Master is capable, yet he chooses not to act.\"* The marquis was greatly pleased.\n\nA divine diviner from Qi came to reside in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He could foretell life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—down to the year, month, ten-day period, or day—with godlike accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Master Hukou: *\"I once thought your Way was supreme, but now there is something even greater.\"* Hukou said: *\"I have shown you only its outward form, not its essence—how can you claim to have attained the Dao? With many females but no male, how can there be offspring? You take the Dao and oppose the world, yet you expect to be believed. That is why he could read your fortune. Try bringing him here to see me.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to meet Hukou. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He cannot last ten days. I saw something strange: he was like damp ashes.\"* Liezi went in, weeping so that his robe was soaked, and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the pattern of earth—stillness like a sprouting seed, neither trembling nor still. He likely saw my latent virtue, sealed and unmoving. Bring him again.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to see Hukou again. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Fortunate that your master met me—he is recovering. There are signs of life in the ashes. I saw his sealed power.\"* Liezi went in and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet vitality arose from the soles of my feet. This is sealed power. He likely saw the sprouting of my good fortune. Bring him again.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to see Hukou once more. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Your master is unsettled—unable to fast. I cannot read him. Have him fast, and I will try again.\"* Liezi went in and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the great emptiness, devoid of signs. He likely saw my balanced *qi* at its subtlest. Where the whirlpool of the *ni* fish forms a deep pool, where still water forms a deep pool, where flowing water forms a deep pool, where overflowing water forms a deep pool, where soaking water forms a deep pool, where sinking water forms a deep pool, where dammed water forms a deep pool, where scattered water forms a deep pool, where rich water forms a deep pool—these are the nine deep pools. Bring him again.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to see Hukou once more.\n\nHe had not yet steadied himself when he lost his composure and fled.\nHukou said: *\"Go after him.\"*\nLiezi pursued him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Hukou: *\"He has vanished—gone without a trace. I could not reach him.\"*\nHukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him what had never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and let it drift—he knew not what or who it was. Taking it for withered grass, taking it for flowing waves, he fled.\"*\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home, believing he had never truly begun to learn. For three years he did not venture out. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he would feed people, and took no special care in his affairs. He carved and polished only to return to simplicity, standing alone in his form like an unworked clod of earth. Withdrawn and self-contained, he remained thus to the end.\n\nWhen Liezi set out for Qi, he turned back halfway. Along the way, he encountered Bohun Maoren.\nBohun Maoren said: *\"Why have you returned?\"*\n*\"I was startled,\"* Liezi replied.\n*\"What startled you?\"*\n*\"I stopped to eat at ten roadside stalls, and at five of them, they served me first.\"*\nBohun Maoren said: *\"And why should that startle you?\"*\nLiezi said: *\"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the body’s demeanor radiates light, which outwardly overawes others’ hearts, making them defer to one younger over those of age and rank, and attend to one’s concerns. Those stallkeepers merely sell broth for a living, seeking only a little extra profit. Their gain is meager, their influence slight, yet they still treated me so—how much more would a lord of ten thousand chariots, wearied by state affairs and drained by governance, entrust me with tasks and demand results? That is why I was startled.\"*\n\nBohun Maoren said: *\"A keen observation! Stay as you are, and others will come to shelter you.\"*\nShortly after, he went to visit, and saw shoes filling the space outside the door.\nBohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After a while, without a word, he went out.\nThe attendant informed Liezi, who rushed barefoot to the door, shoes in hand, and asked: *\"Since you have come, Master, have you not even paused to rest?\"*\n*\"It is done,\"* he replied. *\"I told you before that others would shelter you—now they truly do.\"*\n\nIt is not that you can make others shelter you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so—why then should you be moved by this? Being moved produces strange outcomes. And if one must be moved, it unsettles the root of one’s being—what meaning is there in that? Those who wander with you offer no counsel; their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how then can they be your equals?\n\nYang Zhu journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Cong traveled west to Qin, and they met by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, they encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed: *\"At first I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.\"* Yang Zhu did not reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: *\"Earlier, Master, you looked up to heaven and sighed, saying, ‘At first I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but there was no pause in your steps, so I dared not speak. Now that you have asked, may I inquire as to my fault?\"* Laozi said: *\"Your gaze is haughty and your bearing arrogant—who could bear to dwell with you? The purest white appears stained; the fullest virtue seems lacking.\"* Yang Zhu’s expression changed, and he said: *\"I humbly receive your instruction.\"*\n\nWhen he had first arrived, the innkeepers had welcomed him with deference, the master of the house holding the mat, his wife the towel and comb, the servants stepping aside from their seats, and the kitchen hands leaving the hearth. But upon his return, the innkeepers vied with him for space.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: *\"The beautiful one takes pride in her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful. The plain one is content in her plainness, so I do not see her as plain.\"* Yang Zhu said: *\"Take note, disciples. Act with virtue, but abandon the pride of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"*\n\nIn the world, there are ways that always prevail and ways that do not. The way that always prevails is called softness; the way that does not prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet men fail to understand them. Thus the ancients said: *\"Strength first defies those unlike oneself; softness first yields to oneself. He who first defies those unlike himself will, when he meets his equal, be imperiled. He who first yields to himself will never be imperiled. Use this to overcome a single person, and it is as if you had no opponent; use this to govern the world, and it is as if you bore no burden.\"* Master Zhou said: *\"To be firm, one must hold fast to softness; to be strong, one must preserve weakness. Accumulate softness, and you will become firm; accumulate weakness, and you will become strong. Observe what a man accumulates, and you will know whether fortune or misfortune lies ahead. Strength overcomes those weaker than oneself, but when it meets its equal, it breaks; softness overcomes by yielding to oneself—its power is immeasurable.\"*\n\nLao Dan said: *\"An army’s strength leads to its destruction; a tree’s strength leads to its breaking. The soft and weak belong to the living; the hard and strong belong to the dead.\"* Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike, nor wisdom childlike for appearance to be so. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance; the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles mine are near and beloved; those whose appearance differs are distant and feared.\n\nA body seven feet tall, with hands and feet distinct, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and walking—this is called a human, yet it does not guarantee the absence of a beast’s heart. Though it may have a beast’s heart, its appearance still invites closeness. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws, that fly aloft or crouch to run—these are called birds and beasts, yet they do not guarantee the absence of a human heart. Though they may have a human heart, their appearance still invites distance.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies, human faces, ox heads, and tiger noses—these were forms unlike man’s, yet they possessed the virtue of great sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human features, identical to man’s form, yet they harbored the hearts of beasts. Thus, if the multitude cling to a single appearance in search of supreme wisdom, they will never come close.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor fought with the Flame Emperor at Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites as his banners—this was commanding beasts by force. When Yao appointed Kui to oversee music, striking stone chimes and stone drums, the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* was played to its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was drawing beasts by sound. If the hearts of beasts differ from man’s, how so? Their forms and voices differ from man’s, yet men do not know how to bridge the gap. The sage is without ignorance, without obstruction, and thus can lead and employ them.\n\nThe wisdom of birds and beasts naturally aligns with man’s in some ways. In their desire to preserve life, they do not rely on human intelligence: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid flatlands and seek high ground, shun cold and seek warmth; at rest, they form groups, and when moving, they travel in ranks; the young stay within, the strong guard the outside; when drinking, they lead one another, and when eating, they call to the flock. In the earliest times, they dwelled with man and walked alongside him. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in fear. By the final era, they hid and fled, evading harm.\n\nNow, in the land of Jieshi in the east, there are people who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the result of partial knowledge. The divine sages of high antiquity fully understood the dispositions of all things and completely grasped the sounds of different species. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, treating them as equals to mankind. Thus, they first united with ghosts, spirits, and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This is because the hearts and minds of creatures with blood and qi are not so distant from one another. The divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.\n\nIn Song there was a man called the Monkey Master who loved monkeys. He kept a troop of them and understood their thoughts, just as they understood his.\n\nHe reduced his household’s provisions to satisfy the monkeys’ desires. Soon, however, he found himself impoverished and sought to limit their food. Fearing the monkeys would not submit to him, he first deceived them, saying: “I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four in the evening. Will that suffice?” The monkeys all rose in anger. Then he said: “I will give you chestnuts—four in the morning and three in the evening. Will that suffice?” The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight. All things are ensnared by what they deem base—this is no different. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as the Monkey Master ensnared the monkeys with his cunning. The substance remained unchanged, yet he made them shift between joy and anger.\n\nJi Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: “Are the cocks ready to fight?” Ji replied: “Not yet. They are still vain and reliant on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Not yet. They still react to shadows and echoes.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, they remain unmoved. They appear like wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.”\n\nHui Ang visited King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, coughed loudly, and said rapidly: “What pleases me is courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?” Hui Ang replied: “I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, his blade will not pierce; though he may be strong, his blows will not strike. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “Excellent. This is what I desire to hear.” Hui Ang said: “That his blade does not pierce and his blows do not strike—this is still a form of humiliation. I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he may be strong, he will not dare to strike. That he does not dare is not because he lacks the will. I possess a method by which he fundamentally lacks the will. One who lacks the will has no mind for love or profit. I possess a method by which all men and women in the world joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four virtues. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “This is what I desire to attain.” Hui Ang replied: “Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Though they held no land as rulers nor office as ministers, all men and women in the world craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess this will, then all within your four borders will receive its benefit—you will far surpass Confucius and Mozi.” The king had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out, and the king said to his attendants: “How persuasive! The guest has convinced me with his words.”\n\n*Thus concludes the first scroll of* The Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue.\n*(Variant notes: #1 \"Shuai\" in the Northern Song edition reads \"Shi.\" #2 \"Gong\" in the Northern Song edition reads \"Zhuan.\" #3 The Northern Song edition omits \"si.\" #4 \"Bing\" in the Northern Song edition reads \"Yi.\" #5 The original text includes \"wu\" before \"duo,\" which the Northern Song edition omits.)*\n\n*The Middle Scroll of* The Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue: *King Mu of Zhou* (Part Three)\n\nIn the time of King Mu of Zhou, a *huaren*—a being of transformations—arrived from the farthest western lands. He could enter water and fire unscathed, pass through metal and stone as if they were air; reverse the flow of mountains and rivers, relocate cities and towns; ride the void without falling, touch solid matter without obstruction. His thousand transformations and ten thousand changes knew no limit. Having altered the forms of things, he could also reshape the thoughts of men.\n\nKing Mu revered him as a deity and served him as a sovereign. He yielded his own bedchamber for the *huaren* to dwell in, offered the finest of the three sacrificial animals, and selected the most skilled musicians and dancers to entertain him. Yet the *huaren* found the king’s palace too humble to reside in, its kitchens’ fare too rank to consume, and its consorts too foul to embrace. Thus, King Mu ordered a new palace built, sparing no craftsmanship in its construction—its earthen walls and timber frames adorned with red ochre and white plaster until the five treasuries were emptied and the tower stood complete. Rising a thousand *ren* high, it overlooked the peaks of Mount Zhongnan and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven.\n\nThe king then gathered the fairest maidens from Zheng and Wei—lithe and graceful—anointing them with fragrant oils, painting their brows, adorning them with hairpins and earrings, dressing them in fine silks, trailing their hems in measured steps, powdering their faces white and darkening their eyes. He filled the halls with orchids and angelica, and had them perform *Chengyun*, *Liuying*, *Jiushao*, and *Chenlu* to delight the guest. Each month, jade-stitched robes were presented; each dawn, jade-like delicacies were offered. Yet the *huaren* remained unmoved, and only with reluctance did he ascend the terrace.\n\nBefore long, he invited the king to journey with him. Grasping the *huaren*’s sleeve, the king soared upward until they reached the midst of heaven, where they arrived at the *huaren*’s own palace. This palace was wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, rising above the clouds and rain so that its foundations below were unseen—appearing as if a bank of piled clouds. All that met the eye and ear, all that entered the nose and mouth, was unlike anything in the human realm. The king truly believed he had come to the Celestial Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Grand Harmony of Heaven, the realm of the Supreme Emperor.\n\nLooking down, the king saw his own palaces and pavilions like so many clods of earth or heaps of straw. He lived there for what seemed decades, forgetting his kingdom entirely. The *huaren* then invited him on another journey. Wherever they went, neither sun nor moon shone above, nor rivers nor seas stretched below. The play of light dazzled his eyes until he could see nothing; the din of sound overwhelmed his ears until he could hear nothing. His limbs and organs trembled, unsteady; his mind wandered, his spirit scattered. He begged the *huaren* to return.\n\nThe *huaren* transported him back, and the king felt as though he had fallen from the void. When he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, his attendants unchanged. Before him, the wine remained unclarified, the meat still uncarved, the slices barely begun. When he asked how long he had been gone, his attendants replied, “Your Majesty merely sat in silent contemplation.”\n\nFor three months thereafter, King Mu remained lost in distraction. When he questioned the *huaren* again, the *huaren* said: “I journeyed with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference is there between the place we dwelled and your own palace? Between the realms we traversed and your own gardens? What you took for permanence was but a fleeting illusion; what you doubted was but a moment’s absence. At the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can any model suffice?”\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He cared nothing for state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers or consorts, and gave himself wholly to distant wanderings. He commanded his eight steeds to be harnessed: on the right of the lead chariot, *Siyinhualiu* and *Lü’er*; on the left, *Chiji* and *Bai*; with *Zaofu* as driver and *Yi Qi* as right-hand guard. The second chariot bore *Quhuang* and *Yulun* on the right, *Daoli* and *Shanzi* on the left, with *Baiyao* as driver and *Benrong* as guard. They galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the *Jusou* people.\n\nThe *Jusou* offered the king the blood of white swans to drink, and the fresh milk of cows and horses to wash his feet and those of his two chariot attendants. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the foothills of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, the king ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then he was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted him upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and he harmonized with her, though his verses touched upon but one theme.\n\nThereafter, he observed the place where the sun sets. In a single day, he traveled ten thousand *li*, and the king sighed: “Alas! Though I alone am not filled with virtue, I have found harmony in pleasure. Will later generations count this among my faults?” King Mu was nearly a transcendent being—able to exhaust the joys of an immortal’s life, though he lived but a hundred years. The world regarded him as having ascended to the realm of the gods.\n\nLao Chengzi studied the art of illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years without receiving any instruction. He asked to be told his faults and sought to withdraw, but Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into his chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke: “When the ancestor of Lao Dan journeyed west, he turned to me and said: ‘The *qi* of living beings, the forms of material things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang transform, we call life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and master change, to follow form and shift with it—this we call transformation, illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound, truly difficult to fathom or exhaust. But those who work through form display their art plainly, their work is shallow, and so they rise and vanish in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation differ not from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I, too, are illusions—why study further?’”\n\nLao Chengzi returned home and pondered Master Yin Wen’s words for three months. Thereafter, he could make existence and extinction obey his will, summoning the seasons at whim. In winter, he brought forth thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. Birds ran, beasts flew. For the rest of his life, he never revealed his arts, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “Those who excel in transformation keep their methods hidden and ordinary, their achievements indistinguishable from others’. The virtue of the Five Emperors, the accomplishments of the Three Kings—these were not all the result of wisdom or courage. Some were achieved through transformation. Who can fathom such things?”\n\nAwareness has eight signs, and dreams have six conditions.\n\nWhat are the eight signs? The first is the familiar, the second is action, the third is gain, the fourth is loss, the fifth is sorrow, the sixth is joy, the seventh is life, and the eighth is death. These eight signs are what the body encounters.\n\nWhat are the six conditions? The first is the ordinary dream, the second is the troubled dream, the third is the thought dream, the fourth is the waking dream, the fifth is the joyful dream, and the sixth is the fearful dream. These six arise from the interaction of the spirit.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed when events arise, unsure of their cause. Those who do recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise. Knowing their cause, they are not distressed.\n\nThe ebb and flow, waxing and waning of the single body all correspond with Heaven and Earth and respond to the myriad things. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly full, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking.\n\nThose whose illness is one of floating emptiness dream of soaring; those whose illness is one of sinking fullness dream of drowning. If one sleeps with a belt across the body, one dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying. When cold approaches, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “When the spirit meets, it is a dream; when the body encounters, it is an event. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—these are encounters of spirit and form. Therefore, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Trust waking but do not speak of it; trust dreams but do not act upon them—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things.”\n\nThe true person of old forgot themselves in waking and did not dream in sleep—how could this be empty words?\n\nIn the southwestern corner of the far west lies a land whose borders are unknown, called the Land of Ancient Wilderness. The qi of yin and yang do not interact there, so cold and heat are indistinguishable; the light of the sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are indistinguishable.\n\nThe people of that land eat no food and wear no clothes, yet they sleep often, waking once every fifty days. To them, what they do in dreams is real, while what they perceive in waking is illusory.\n\nThe Central Kingdom spans the four seas, stretching north and south across the Yellow River and east and west beyond Mount Tai, covering over ten thousand li. There, the measured interplay of yin and yang brings alternating cold and heat; the clear division of dusk and dawn brings alternating day and night. Its people range from wise to foolish, and the myriad things flourish in abundance, their skills and arts manifold. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rites and laws in mutual support. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond reckoning. They regard what they do in waking as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nIn the northeastern corner lies a land called the Land of Fuoluo. Its earth is perpetually warm, and though bathed in the lingering light of the sun and moon, no fine crops grow there. The people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, and they value victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, ever awake and never sleeping.\n\nIn Zhou, the magnate Yin amassed great wealth, and his subordinates toiled ceaselessly from dawn to dusk. An old laborer, his strength spent, was yet pressed to work harder. By day, he groaned as he toiled; by night, he sank into deep slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and night after night, he dreamed he was a ruler—presiding over the people, governing the state, roaming palaces and gardens, indulging every desire, his joy beyond compare. But waking, he returned to servitude. When others consoled him for his toil, he said: “A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is beyond compare. What cause have I for complaint?”\n\nYin, meanwhile, was consumed by worldly affairs and preoccupied with his family’s fortune. His mind and body were exhausted, and at night, he too sank into deep slumber. Night after night, he dreamed he was a servant—running errands, performing every task, enduring curses and beatings without end. In his sleep, he muttered and groaned, only falling silent at dawn. Troubled, Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: “Your rank brings you honor, your wealth is more than enough—you surpass others by far. Yet you dream of being a servant, for hardship and ease must balance in time. How could you hope to have both waking and dreaming as you wish?”\n\nHearing his friend’s words, Yin eased the laborers’ burdens and reduced his own worries. His illness and distress soon abated.\n\nA man from Zheng was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He chased it down and struck it dead. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch and covered it with reeds, overjoyed beyond measure. But soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale. A passerby, hearing his words, followed them to retrieve the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife: “A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he left it. Now I have it—he was the one truly dreaming.” His wife said: “Is it not you who dreamed of the woodcutter finding the deer? Could there really have been a woodcutter? Now that you truly have the deer, is it not your dream that was real?” The man replied: “I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”\n\nThe woodcutter, dismayed at losing the deer, dreamed that very night of the place he had hidden it—and of the man who had taken it. At first light, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to the magistrate. The magistrate said: “At first, you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took your deer, and now you dispute it with him. My wife says that both of you dreamed of the deer, and no one truly has it. But since the deer is here, let us divide it in two.” He reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing someone’s deer?” He consulted his prime minister, who said: “Whether one dreams or not, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle this? For now, let us trust the magistrate’s judgment.”\n\nIn the Yangli district of Song, a man named Hua suffered from forgetfulness in middle age. What he took in the morning, he forgot by evening; what he gave at dusk, he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He no longer knew what came before or after. His household despaired. They consulted diviners, but the omens were unclear; they sought shamans to pray, but the prayers were ineffective; they called physicians to treat him, but the illness persisted.\n\nA Confucian scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua. Hua’s wife and children offered half their estate in exchange for his remedy. The scholar said: “This is not a matter for divination, prayer, or medicine. Let me try to transform his mind and alter his thoughts—perhaps he may yet recover.” So he stripped Hua of his clothes, and Hua sought garments; he starved him, and Hua sought food; he confined him in darkness, and Hua sought light.\n\nThe Confucian scholar joyfully told Hua’s son: “The illness can be cured!” Yet he added, “My method is secret—passed down through generations but never disclosed to others. Let me send away all attendants and stay alone with him for seven days.” They complied, unaware of what he did, but Hua’s long-standing affliction vanished in a single morning.\n\nOnce awakened, Hua flew into a rage. He cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a spear to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua said: “Before, I was lost in forgetfulness—adrift, unaware whether heaven and earth even existed. Now, suddenly recalling the past, the tangled threads of decades—life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate—all surge forth. I fear that the future’s entanglements of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate will disorder my mind like this. Could I ever regain even a moment’s forgetfulness?”\n\nZigong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: “This is beyond your understanding.” Then he turned to Yan Hui and told him to remember it.\n\nAmong the people of Qin, the Feng clan had a son who was clever in youth but developed a delusional disorder in adulthood. He mistook singing for weeping, white for black, fragrance for rot, sweetness for bitterness, and wrong for right. Whatever his mind turned to—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted. The Yang clan said to his father: “The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they cure him? Why not seek their help?”\n\nHis father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: “How do you know your son is deluded? Today, all under heaven are confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing his affliction are many, yet none awaken. A single person’s delusion cannot overturn a household; a household’s delusion cannot overturn a village; a village’s delusion cannot overturn a state; a state’s delusion cannot overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded like your son, who would overturn whom? If everyone’s heart were like his, you would be the one deluded. Joy and sorrow, sounds and colors, scents and flavors, right and wrong—who can set them straight? Moreover, my words may themselves be delusion. How could the mediocre scholars of Lu untangle another’s confusion? Conserve your provisions and hasten home.”\n\nA man from Yan was born in Yan, raised in Chu, and in old age returned to his homeland. Passing through Jin, his traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying: “This is the city of Yan.” His expression darkened. They pointed to a village shrine and said: “This is your village’s shrine.”\n\nThen he sighed deeply. Pointing to a house, they said: “This is your ancestors’ dwelling.” He wept silently. Pointing to a mound, they said: “This is your ancestors’ grave.” The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying: “We were only jesting with you—this is but the land of Jin.” The man was stunned.\n\nWhen he at last reached Yan and truly saw the city and village shrine of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow diminished.\n\n---\n\n**Part Four**\n\nConfucius was at leisure in his chamber when Zigong entered to attend him, his countenance troubled. Zigong dared not ask, but upon leaving, he told Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and sang. Hearing this, Confucius summoned Yan Hui back and asked: “Why do you alone find joy?”\n\nYan Hui replied: “Why does the Master alone bear sorrow?”\n\nConfucius said: “First speak your own mind.”\n\nYan Hui said: “I once heard the Master say: ‘He who delights in the Dao and knows fate is therefore without sorrow’—this is why I find joy.”\n\nConfucius, his expression darkening, asked: “Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood. That was my teaching of former days; let my words of today be taken as correct. You know only that delighting in the Dao and knowing fate brings freedom from sorrow, but you do not know that delighting in the Dao and knowing fate entails a sorrow greater still.\n\nNow I will tell you the truth: to cultivate the self, to accept poverty or prosperity, to know that past and future are not one’s own, to banish disturbance from the heart—this is what you call delighting in the Dao and knowing fate without sorrow. Formerly, I studied the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern all under heaven and leave a legacy for future generations—not merely to cultivate the self or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lose their proper order; benevolence and righteousness grow ever weaker, human nature ever more shallow. If the Dao cannot prevail in a single state or a single generation, how can it prevail in all under heaven or for ages to come? I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform it—this is the sorrow of one who delights in the Dao and knows fate.\n\nThough even so, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of which I speak are not what the ancients called joy and knowledge. Without joy, without knowledge—this is true joy, true knowledge. Thus there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. Why then abandon the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why seek to reform them?”\n\nYan Hui bowed northward and said: “I too have grasped it.” He went out and told Zigong. Zigong stood bewildered, lost in thought. Returning home, he brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his frame was reduced to bone. Yan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’ gate, playing the zither and chanting the classics all day without cease.\n\n---\n\nA minister of Chen, on a mission to Lu, sought a private audience with the house of Shusun. Shusun said: “In our state there is a sage.”\n\nThe minister asked: “Is it not Kong Qiu?”\n\nShusun replied: “It is. How did you know he is a sage?”\n\nShusun said: “I once heard Yan Hui say: ‘Kong Qiu can still the mind and employ the body.’”\n\nThe minister of Chen said: “In our state, too, there is a sage—did you not know? Who is this sage?”\n\nShusun asked: “Of whom do you speak?”\n\nThe minister said: “Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi who has attained Lao Dan’s Dao. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to invite him. Kang Cangzi accepted the summons and came. The Lord of Lu, speaking humbly, sought his instruction.\n\nKang Cangzi said: “The reports of me are false. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse their functions.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu said: “This is even more extraordinary! What is the nature of your Dao? I earnestly wish to hear it.”\n\nKang Cangzi said: “My body aligns with my mind, my mind with my qi, my qi with my spirit, my spirit with the formless. If there is the slightest presence of something, the faintest sound, whether far away at the ends of the earth or near at hand between my brows, whatever comes to disturb me, I will surely know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness comes from my seven orifices and four limbs, or from the knowledge of my heart and six viscera—it simply knows itself.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu was overjoyed. Later, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n---\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and asked: “Is Qiu a sage?”\n\nConfucius said: “How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Yet Qiu is one of broad learning and many attainments.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Three Kings sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Five Emperors sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in adapting to the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward, greatly startled, said: “Then who is a sage?”\n\nConfucius, his expression shifting after a pause, said: “Among the people of the West, there is one who may be a sage. He does not govern, yet there is no disorder; he does not speak, yet is trusted; he does not transform, yet things follow their course. So vast is he that the people cannot name him. I suspect he may be a sage, but I do not know whether he truly is a sage—or truly is not.”\n\nThe Grand Steward fell silent, pondering to himself: “Kong Qiu deceives me!”\n\n---\n\nZixia asked Confucius: “What sort of man is Yan Hui?”\n\nConfucius said: “Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zigong?”\n\nConfucius said: “Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zilu?”\n\nConfucius said: “You’s courage surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zizhang?”\n\nConfucius said: “Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked: “Then why do these four serve you?”\n\nConfucius said: “Sit. I will tell you.”\n\nHui may possess benevolence, yet he cannot return to simplicity; Ci may possess eloquence, yet he cannot be reticent; You may possess courage, yet he cannot be timid; Shi may possess dignity, yet he cannot be yielding. Were I to exchange all that I have for the strengths of these four, I would not consent. This is why they serve me without divided loyalty.\n\nMaster Liezi had already taken Huqiu Zilin as his teacher and befriended Bohun Maoren, then dwelled in the southern outskirts. Those who followed him daily grew in number yet never surpassed him. Nevertheless, Liezi was still somewhat lacking: each morning, they debated together, and there was nothing he had not heard. Yet for twenty years, he shared a wall with Nan Guozi, never paying visits or sending invitations. When they met on the road, their eyes seemed not to see each other. The servants at Liezi’s gate assumed there must be enmity between him and Nan Guozi.\n\nA man arrived from Chu and asked Liezi: “Master, what enmity do you have with Nan Guozi?”\n\nLiezi said: “Nan Guozi’s appearance is full, yet his mind is empty; his ears hear nothing, his eyes see nothing, his mouth speaks nothing, his mind knows nothing, his form shows no agitation. What could one do with him? Nevertheless, I will go with you.”\n\nHe gathered forty disciples and set out together. When they saw Nan Guozi, he indeed appeared like a disembodied spirit, impossible to engage. Looking back at Liezi, his form and spirit were not in harmony, and he could not blend in with the group. Suddenly, Nan Guozi pointed to Liezi’s disciples who had not yet spoken and addressed them, his manner cheerful and forthright, like a leader among men.\n\nLiezi’s disciples were astonished. Returning home, they all wore expressions of doubt.\n\nLiezi said: “Those who have attained the Dao speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use silence as speech is still speech; to use ignorance as knowledge is still knowledge. Silence and not speaking, ignorance and not knowing—these are also speech and knowledge. They are without anything not spoken, without anything not known; yet also without anything spoken, without anything known. It is simply thus. Why are you so groundlessly astonished?”\n\nLiezi studied for three years, after which his heart dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, nor his mouth speak of profit and harm. Only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him once. Five years later, his heart again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of profit and harm, and only then did Old Shang begin to relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, whatever his heart conceived, there was no longer right or wrong; whatever his mouth uttered, there was no longer profit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him to sit beside him on the same mat. Nine years later, whether his heart wandered or his mouth spoke freely, he knew not whether these were his own right and wrong, profit and harm, or another’s. Inner and outer had advanced as one. Thereafter, his eyes were as ears, his ears as nose, his nose as mouth—all were indistinguishable. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, flesh and bone fused entirely. He no longer sensed what his body leaned against, where his feet trod, what his heart conceived, or what his words concealed. It was simply thus. Then no principle remained hidden.\n\nEarlier, Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu asked: “Yu Kou delights in wandering—what does he delight in when he wanders?” Liezi replied: “The joy of wandering lies in savoring what has no fixed nature. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering, wandering—none can distinguish this wandering.” Master Huqiu said: “Is Yu Kou’s wandering truly the same as others’, or is it truly different? All that is seen is ever seen in its transformations. To delight in the unfixed nature of things yet not know that I, too, am unfixed—to seek wandering outwardly yet not know to seek inner contemplation—this is the way. The outward wanderer seeks completion in things; the inward observer finds sufficiency in the self. Finding sufficiency in the self is the perfection of wandering; seeking completion in things is its imperfection.” Thereupon, Liezi never left his home again, believing himself ignorant of wandering. Master Huqiu said: “Is this not the perfection of wandering? The perfect wanderer knows not where he goes; the perfect observer knows not what he beholds. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, what I call observation. Thus it is said: Is this not the perfection of wandering? Is this not the perfection of wandering?”\n\nLong Shu said to Wen Zhi: “Your art is subtle. I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?” Wen Zhi replied: “I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your ailment.” Long Shu said: “Praise from my village brings me no honor, slander from my state brings me no shame. Gain does not gladden me, loss does not grieve me. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as no different from them. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; viewing my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. All these manifold afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor decline, profit nor harm can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me. Thus, I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this affliction? What method can cure it?”\n\nThen Wen Zhi bade Long Shu stand with his back to the light. Wen Zhi himself stood behind him, facing the light, and gazed at him. After a while, he said: “Ah! Now I see your heart. The square inch of ground within is empty—you are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, with only one still blocked. Is it not perhaps from this that those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction arise? This is not something my shallow art can cure.\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generating is the Dao. That which is generated by generation, though it may end, does not perish—this is constancy. That which is generated yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao. That which dies by death, though it may not yet have come to pass, perishes of itself—this too is constancy. That which dies yet lives is fortune.\n\nThus, to live without use is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain an end is called constancy. To die with use is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy. When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang. When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept. The birth of a bondsman, the death of a bondsman—common folk sing, common folk weep.\n\nOne whose eyes are about to dim first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to deafen first hears the gnat in flight; one whose palate is about to fail first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Meng; one whose nose is about to block first detects the scent of charred rot; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens to flee; one whose heart is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when a thing does not reach its end, it does not return.\n\nIn Zheng, the marshlands of Puze abounded in worthies, and Dongli teemed with talent. During the campaign at Puze, there was a man named Bo Fengzi who, passing through Dongli, encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: “Let us perform a dance for him. What think you of that one approaching?” His disciples replied: “We would gladly know.” Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: “Do you understand the meaning of nourishing and being nourished? To receive nourishment from others yet be unable to nourish oneself is the way of dogs and swine. To nourish things and have them serve one’s use is the power of man. If your followers eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest, it is the achievement of governance. Yet when the old and young gather in droves to become fodder for the pens and kitchens, how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?”\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond. One of his followers stepped out of turn and advanced, saying: “Has the Master not heard of the many devices in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in working earth and wood, those skilled in working metal and leather, those skilled in music, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are assembled. Yet without one to order their positions, without one to command their abilities, and when the one who orders lacks knowledge, the one who commands lacks ability, then knowledge and ability are made to serve. The one who governs is but one whom we make to serve. Why then do you boast, Deng Xi?” Deng Xi could make no reply; he glared at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nGongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and sent an envoy to summon him. When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his form, he saw only a feeble man. Perplexed, King Xuan asked: “What is the measure of your strength?” Gongyi Bo replied: “Your servant’s strength can snap the leg of a spring louse and bear the wing of an autumn cicada.” The king’s expression darkened as he said: “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or a young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen, yet I still regret my weakness. You can snap the leg of a spring louse and bear the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—how can this be?” Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: “Excellent is Your Majesty’s question. I dare speak truly in reply.”\n\nMy master, a man of Shangqiu named Zi, possessed strength unmatched in the world, yet his kin never knew it, for he never once employed his strength. I served him unto death. He once instructed me: “One who wishes to see what others cannot must train his eyes where others do not look; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot must cultivate what others do not practice. Thus, those who learn to see first perceive a cartload of firewood, and those who learn to hear first catch the tolling of a bell. For one whose inner power is effortless, no outer task is difficult. When no outer task is difficult, his name does not leave even a single household.”\n\nNow my name is known among the feudal lords—this means I have violated my master’s teaching and made my ability conspicuous. Yet my renown does not come from squandering my strength, but from knowing how to use it. Is this not better than squandering it?\n\nThe Lord Mou of Zhongshan, a worthy prince of Wei, delighted in the company of worthy men. He neglected state affairs and took pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long, a man of Zhao. The disciples of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Lord Mou asked: “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?”\n\nZiyu replied: “Gongsun Long’s character is such that he follows no master, studies with no companions, flatters glibly without substance, rambles aimlessly without a school, and delights in the strange while uttering absurdities. He seeks to bewilder men’s minds and silence their speech, practicing sophistry alongside men like Han Tan.”\n\nLord Mou’s expression changed as he said: “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray tell me the truth.”\n\nZiyu said: “I laugh at how Long deceived Kong Chuan, saying that a skilled archer could make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, each shot following the last, each shaft linked to the next, so that the first arrow reaches the target without a single miss, and the nock of the last arrow still rests on the bowstring—appearing as one. Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: ‘This is not yet the marvel.’ A disciple of Yuan Meng named Hong Chao, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and loosed a Qiwei arrow at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not blink; the arrow fell to the ground, and not a speck of dust was stirred. Can this truly be the words of a wise man?”\n\nLord Mou said: “The words of the wise are not understood by fools. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock hooks the later to the earlier. The arrow flying toward the pupil without the eyelid blinking exhausts the arrow’s momentum. Why do you doubt this?”\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: “You are a follower of Long—how could you not gloss over his flaws? I shall tell you of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: ‘There is intention without mind. There is pointing without reaching. There is substance without exhaustion. There is shadow without movement. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf never had a mother.’ His violations of categories and inversions of logic are too numerous to recount.”\n\nLord Mou said: “You take profound words as absurdities—your error is greater still. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all things are reached. To exhaust a thing is to possess it always. That a shadow does not move lies in its transformation. A single hair drawing a thousand jun arises from equal force. That a white horse is not a horse comes from the separation of form and name. That an orphaned calf never had a mother means it is not an orphaned calf.”\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: “You take all of Gongsun Long’s prattling as reasoned argument. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would still endorse them.”\n\nLord Mou fell silent for a long while, then withdrew, saying: “Let me wait for another day to call upon you and discuss this further.”\n\nWhen Yao ruled the world for fifty years, he did not know whether the world was well governed or not, nor whether the countless people wished to support him or not. He turned to his attendants and asked, but they did not know; he asked the outer court, and they did not know; he asked those in the wilds, and they did not know.\n\nYao then disguised himself and wandered through the bustling thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a rhyme:\n\n*“He raised us, the steaming masses,\nNo lack in your ultimate measure.\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nWe follow the Dao of the Lord.”*\n\nDelighted, Yao asked, “Who taught you these words?”\nThe children replied, “We heard them from a grandee.”\nHe asked the grandee, who said, “It is an ancient poem.”\n\nYao returned to his palace, summoned Shun, and thereupon abdicated the world to him. Shun accepted without refusal.\n\nGuan Yinxi said: *“Abiding in nothingness, forms manifest their presence.\nIts movement is like water, its stillness like a mirror, its response like an echo—thus is the Dao like things.\nThings depart from the Dao; the Dao does not depart from things.\nThose who are good at the Dao neither use their ears, nor their eyes, nor their strength, nor their minds.\nTo seek the Dao through seeing, hearing, form, or knowledge is to miss the mark.\nIt may seem before you, then suddenly behind; employed, it fills the Six Voids; abandoned, none know its whereabouts.\nNeither those with minds can grasp it from afar, nor those without minds draw near.\nOnly those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature obtain it—knowing yet forgetting emotion, capable yet not acting, this is true knowledge and true ability.\nIf one lacks knowledge, how can there be emotion? If one lacks ability, how can there be action?\nA clod of earth, a pile of dust—though non-active, it is not the Dao.”*\n\n**Tang’s Fifth Inquiry**\nTang of Yin asked Xia Ge: “In the earliest antiquity, were there things?”\nXia Ge replied: “In the earliest antiquity, there were no things. How could there be things now? Would later generations be right to say there are no things now?”\nTang of Yin said: “Then do things have no before or after?”\nXia Ge said: “The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. The beginning may become the end, the end may become the beginning—how can one know their order? Yet beyond things, before events, I do not know.”\nTang of Yin said: “Then do the eight directions and above and below have limits?”\nGe said: “I do not know.”\nTang pressed further.\nGe said: *“Where there is nothing, there is no limit; where there is something, there is an end—how could I know this?\nYet beyond the limitless there is no further limitlessness, within the endless there is no further endlessness.\nLimitlessness has no further limitlessness, endlessness has no further endlessness.\nFrom this I know it is limitless and endless, but I do not know that it has limits or ends.”*\nTang asked again: “What lies beyond the four seas?”\nGe said: “The same as the Central States.”\nTang said: “How do you confirm this?”\nGe said: *“I traveled east to Ying, and the people were the same. Asking about east of Ying, it was still like Ying.\nI traveled west to Bin, and the people were the same. Asking about west of Bin, it was still like Bin.\nFrom this I know the four seas, the four wastes, the four poles are no different.\nThus the great and small contain one another without end.\nOne who contains the ten thousand things is like one who contains heaven and earth—containing the ten thousand things, he is not exhausted; containing heaven and earth, he is limitless.\nHow do I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths? This too I do not know.\nYet heaven and earth are also things.\nThings are insufficient, so in ancient times Nüwa smelted stones of five colors to mend their gaps, severed the legs of the great turtle to prop up the four poles.\nLater, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne, and in rage struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth.\nThus heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; earth was not full in the southeast, so the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there.”*\nTang asked again: “Do things have great and small? Long and short? Same and different?”\n\nGé said: East of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great abyss, a bottomless valley indeed, called the Returning Gully. The waters of the Eight Directions and Nine Wilds, the currents of the Celestial River—none fail to pour into it, yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nWithin it stand five mountains: the first is called Dàiyú, the second Yuánqiáo, the third Fānghú, the fourth Yíngzhōu, and the fifth Pénglái. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, yet they are neighbors. Their terraces and towers are all of gold and jade, their birds and beasts all pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all rich in flavor; those who eat them never age nor die. The inhabitants are all of the seed of immortals and sages, and those who fly back and forth between them in a single day or night are beyond counting.\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains had no fixed mooring, drifting ceaselessly with the tides, unable to stand firm for even a moment. The immortals and sages, distressed, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the westernmost reaches and the dwellings of the assembled sages be lost, he commanded Yújiāng to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains aloft. They took turns in three shifts, rotating every sixty thousand years. Thus the five mountains stood firm and unmoving.\n\nNow, in the land of Lóngbó there lived giants whose strides spanned the five mountains in fewer than a dozen steps. One of them cast a line and hooked six of the turtles at once, then carried them back to his country, where he scorched their bones to divine by their cracks. Thereupon the two mountains Dàiyú and Yuánqiáo drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, and the immortals and sages who were displaced numbered in the countless millions. The Emperor, enraged, diminished the land of Lóngbó to straiten it and shrank its people to shorten them. By the time of Fúxī and Shénnóng, its inhabitants still measured several thousand *zhàng* in height.\n\nFrom the Central States eastward four hundred thousand *li* lies the land of Jiāoyáo, where people stand a foot and a half tall. In the far northeast there are beings called the Tranquil Folk, nine inches in height. South of the Jing region dwell the Dark Numinous Ones, for whom five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Chūn Tree, for whom eight thousand years make a spring and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow fungi and mushrooms that sprout at dawn and wither by dusk. In the months of spring and summer there are midges and gnats that come to life with the rain and die at the sight of the sun.\n\nNorth of the northernmost reaches lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake, wherein dwells a fish several thousand *li* in breadth, its length commensurate, called the Kūn. There is also a bird called the Péng, its wings like clouds trailing from the sky, its body in proportion. Does the world know of such creatures? Great Yǔ beheld them in his travels, Bóyì named them in his knowledge, and Yíjiān recorded them in his annals.\n\nBetween the riverbanks there breed tiny insects called the Jiāomíng, which swarm and alight upon the lashes of mosquitoes without touching them. They come and go, roost and depart, yet the mosquito remains unaware. Lízhū and Zǐyǔ, in broad daylight, rubbed their eyes and raised their brows to peer, yet could not make out their form. Jiǎohǔ, Chǒuzhì, Wényú, Pǔmǐ, Sānqièyú, and Shī Kuàng, in the dead of night, cupped their ears and bent their heads to listen, yet could not catch their sound. Only the Yellow Emperor and Róngchéngzǐ, dwelling upon Kōngtóng, fasted together for three months, their hearts stilled and bodies forgotten. Then, with their spirit, they gazed slowly and saw them as clearly as the slopes of Mount Sōng; with their *qi*, they listened slowly and heard them as loudly as thunder.\n\nIn the lands of Hào and Chǔ, there stands a great tree called the *yòu*, its verdant branches bearing fruit in winter. Its berries are crimson and tart. Drinking the sap of its bark cures the malady of *fènjué*. The people of Qízhōu prize it, yet when carried north across the Huái River, it transforms into the *zhǐ*. The myna bird does not cross the Jǐ River, and the raccoon dog perishes if it crosses the Wèn—such is the nature of the land’s *qi*.\n\nYet though their forms and *qi* differ, their natures remain the same; none may alter another. All things preserve their wholeness in life, their sufficiency in portion. How then do I discern their greatness or smallness? Their length or brevity? Their sameness or difference?\n\nThe Twin Mountains, Great Shape and Kingly Terrace, span seven hundred *li* in breadth and rise ten thousand *rèn* in height. They once stood south of Jìzhōu and north of Héyáng. There lived an old man of the Northern Mountains, nearly ninety years of age, who dwelt facing them. Vexed by the blockage to the north and the circuitous paths it forced, he gathered his household to deliberate:\n\n“Let us join our strength to level this perilous terrain, carving a passage south to Yù and onward to the southern bank of the Hàn—would this not be good?”\n\nAll assented with one voice. His wife, however, raised a doubt: “With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuífù—how then will you move Great Shape and Kingly Terrace? And where will you put the earth and stones?”\n\nThe others replied: “We shall cast them into the far reaches of the Eastern Sea, north of Yǐntǔ.”\n\nThereupon, he led his sons and grandsons—three men strong enough to bear the load—striking stone and tilling soil, hauling the debris in baskets to the edge of the Eastern Sea. A widow from the neighboring Jīngchéng clan had a fatherless boy, just old enough to carry himself, who leapt to join their labor. Winter and summer turned, and only then did they make a single return journey.\n\nThe River Bend sage laughed and tried to stop him, saying: “How foolish you are! With your waning years and remaining strength, you cannot even strip a single blade of grass from the mountain—what then can you do with earth and stone?”\n\nNorth Mountain Foolish Old Man sighed deeply and replied: “Your heart is so rigid it cannot be pierced—you are not even the equal of a widow or a weak child. Though I die, I have sons who survive. Sons beget grandsons, grandsons beget sons, sons again beget sons, sons again beget grandsons—sons and grandsons without end. Yet the mountains do not grow larger. Why then should they not be leveled?”\n\nThe River Bend sage had no answer. The spirit who wields the serpent heard of this and, fearing he would never cease, reported it to the Emperor. Moved by his sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains—one placed east of Shuò, the other south of Yōng. From that time on, south of Jì and north of the Hàn, there were no more ridges to block the way.\n\nKuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow and pursued it to the edge of Yú Valley. Thirsting for drink, he rushed to the Yellow River and the Wèi. When the Yellow River and the Wèi proved insufficient, he set off north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he arrived, he died of thirst along the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the ground, the Dèng Forest grew. The Dèng Forest spread wide for thousands of *li*.\n\nGreat Yǔ said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, marked by the four seasons, and bound by the Great Year. The beings born of spirits and gods, their forms and natures—whether short-lived or long—only the sage can fathom their Dao.”\n\nXià Gé replied: “Yet there are those who arise without relying on spirits, take form without depending on yin and yang, shine without needing sun and moon, die young without violence, live long without care, eat without grain, clothe themselves without silk or floss, travel without boats or chariots. Their Dao is natural—beyond even the sage’s comprehension.”\n\nWhen Yǔ governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed into a foreign realm. By the northern shore of the Northern Sea, beyond countless thousands of *li* from Qí Province, lay a land called Zhōngběi, its borders and limits unknown. No wind or rain, frost or dew fell there, nor did birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grow. All was level, encircled by towering ridges. At the land’s center stood a mountain named Húlǐng, shaped like an overturned jar. At its summit was an opening, round like a ring, called the Nourishing Cavern. Water gushed forth, named the Divine Spring, its fragrance surpassing orchid and pepper, its taste finer than fine wine. From this single source, four channels flowed down the mountain, irrigating the entire land without exception. The earth’s qi was harmonious, and no plagues or epidemics arose.\n\nThe people were gentle and compliant, neither competitive nor contentious, soft-hearted and weak-boned, neither arrogant nor envious. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects; men and women mingled freely without matchmakers or betrothals. They lived along the water, neither plowing nor sowing. The earth’s qi was warm and agreeable, so they neither wove nor wore clothes. They lived a hundred years without dying young or falling ill. Their population flourished without count, ever joyful, never aging or sorrowful.\n\nTheir custom was to love music. They linked hands and sang in turns, their voices never ceasing all day. When hungry or weary, they drank from the Divine Spring, their strength and spirits harmonious. If they overindulged, they became drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in the Divine Spring, their skin grew sleek and glossy, their fragrance lingering for ten days.\n\nKing Mù of Zhōu traveled north and passed through their land, remaining three years before remembering to return. Once back in his court, he longed for that country, lost in melancholy. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after several months did he recover.\n\nGuǎn Zhòng urged Duke Huán of Qí to journey to Liáokǒu, intending to reach that land together. They nearly succeeded, but Xí Péng admonished: “Why abandon Qí’s vast lands, its teeming people, its scenic mountains and rivers, its fertile resources, its flourishing rites and justice, its splendid robes and ornaments? Your halls overflow with beauty, your court with loyal ministers. With a shout, a million soldiers answer; with a gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and forsake Qí’s altars of soil and grain to follow barbarians?”\n\nDuke Huán desisted, relaying Xí Péng’s words to Guǎn Zhòng. Guǎn Zhòng replied: “This is beyond Péng’s understanding. I fear that land cannot be known.” Why cling to Qí’s wealth? Why heed Xí Péng’s words?\n\nAmong the southern peoples, some shave their heads and go bare; in the north, they wear fur hats and robes; in the Central States, they don crowns and skirts. Across the Nine Provinces, some farm, some trade, some hunt, some fish—like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land, all obtained naturally, shaped by nature.\n\nEast of Yuè lies the nation of Zhéxiū, where the eldest son is butchered and eaten at birth, called “favoring the younger brother.” When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying: “A ghost-wife cannot dwell with the living.”\n\nSouth of Chǔ lies the land of the Yán people. When kin die, they rot the flesh with maggots, share it among themselves, then discard it before burying the bones—only then are they deemed filial.\n\nWest of Qín lies the nation of Yíqú Wénkāng. When kin die, they pile firewood and burn the body. The rising smoke is called “ascending to the distant,” and only then are they deemed filial. Such practices, whether imposed by rulers or adopted as custom, are hardly strange.\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. When he asked the reason, one child said: “I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon.”\n\nThe other child said: “I believe the sun is farther at dawn and nearer at noon.”\n\nThe first child said: “At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but by noon, it is only the size of a plate or bowl. Is this not proof that what is far appears small, and what is near appears large?”\n\nOne child said: \"At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but by noon, it is scalding like boiling water—is this not proof that what is near is hot and what is far is cool?\"\n\nConfucius could not decide between them.\n\nThe two children laughed and said: \"Who says you are so wise?\"\n\nUniformity is the supreme principle of the world, and this holds even for physical things. When a hair is uniformly suspended, it will break under the slightest weight if the tension is uneven. Yet if truly uniform, it will not break at all. Others may doubt this, but there are those who know it to be so.\n\nZhān Hé used a single silkworm’s thread for his line, a needle’s barb for his hook, a stalk of thorny bramble for his rod, and a split grain for his bait. With these, he drew fish as large as a cart from an abyss a hundred *ren* deep, in the midst of rushing currents—yet his line did not snap, his hook did not straighten, and his rod did not bend.\n\nThe King of Chǔ, hearing of this, found it extraordinary and summoned him to ask the reason. Zhān Hé replied: \"I once heard my late master say that when Pú Jūzǐ went fowling, he used a weak bow and a fine thread, riding the wind to send his arrow aloft, striking two cormorants in the blue sky. His success came from focused intent and balanced movement. I took his example and applied it to fishing, spending five years mastering the Way. When I stand by the river with my rod, my mind is free of distractions, fixed only on the fish. I cast my line and lower my hook with a hand that knows no lightness or heaviness, so nothing can disturb me. To the fish, my hook and bait seem no more than sinking dust or floating foam—they swallow it without hesitation. This is how the weak overcomes the strong, and the light achieves the heavy.\n\n\"If Your Majesty governs the state with such focus and balance, the realm could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?\"\n\nThe King of Chǔ said: \"Well said.\"\n\nTwo men, Gōng Yù of Lǔ and Qí Yīng of Zhào, fell ill and together sought treatment from Biǎn Què. After Biǎn Què cured them, he said to Gōng Yù and Qí Yīng: \"Your past illnesses, which entered from outside to afflict the organs, were naturally cured by medicine and stone needles. But now you have an illness that has grown with your bodies since birth. If I were to treat this for you, what would you say?\"\n\nThe two replied: \"We would first like to hear the signs.\"\n\nBian Que said to Gong Yu: \"Your will is strong but your qi is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decision. Qi Ying’s will is weak but his qi is strong, so he lacks foresight yet acts with reckless force. If I were to exchange your hearts, you would both attain balance in goodness.\"\n\nThereupon, Bian Que gave the two men a poisoned wine to drink, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then opened their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and restored them with a divine medicine. When they awoke, they were as before.\n\nThe two men took their leave and returned home. Gong Yu, however, went to Qi Ying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qi Ying went to Gong Yu’s house and took possession of his wife and children, yet they too did not recognize him. The two households then brought their dispute before Bian Que to adjudicate. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was resolved.\n\nWhen Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Zheng Shiwen, hearing of this, abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the notes, yet he could not form a single melody. Master Xiang said: \"You may return home now.\"\n\nShiwen set down his zither and sighed: \"It is not that my fingers cannot hook the strings, nor that I cannot form a melody. What I seek does not lie in the strings, nor does my aspiration rest in sound. If within I am not settled in my heart, and without I do not harmonize with qi, I dare not lift my hand to move the strings. Grant me a little more time to see what comes of it.\"\n\nBefore long, he returned to Master Xiang. The master asked: \"How is your zither playing now?\"\n\nShiwen replied: \"I have grasped it. Allow me to demonstrate.\"\n\nAt this, he struck the *shang* string in spring to summon *Nanlü*, and suddenly a freezing wind arose, causing grasses and trees to bear fruit. When autumn came, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm breeze gently swirled, making grasses and trees flourish. In summer, he plucked the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow fell together, while rivers and ponds froze solid. When winter arrived, he struck the *zhi* string to excite *Rui Bin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting hard ice in an instant.\n\nAs the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* string to unite the four, and at once a balmy breeze soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew descended, and fragrant springs welled forth. Master Xiang then clapped his chest and leapt in joy, exclaiming: \"How subtle is your playing, my student! Even the *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang or the pitch-pipes of Zou Yan could not surpass it—those masters would clutch their zithers and flutes to follow in your wake.\"\n\nXue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing, but before mastering his teacher’s art, he claimed to have learned it all and took his leave to return home. Qin Qing did not stop him. At the crossroads outside the city, he gave a farewell feast, beating time and singing a mournful song. His voice shook the trees, and its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then begged forgiveness and asked to return, swearing never to speak of leaving again. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said:\n\n\"Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, but her provisions ran out. Passing through Yongmen, she sold her songs to beg for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without fading, and those nearby felt as though she had not departed. When she stayed at an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then let forth a drawn-out, sorrowful cry, and the elders and children of the village grieved together, weeping face to face for three days without eating. They hastily pursued her. When Han E returned, she sang a long, melodious song, and the villagers leapt and danced for joy, unable to contain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. Thus they richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. To this day, the people of Yongmen excel in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering tones.\"\n\nBoyi was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Boyi played with his mind set on climbing a high mountain, Zhong Ziqi said: \"How fine! Lofty as Mount Tai!\" When his intent turned to flowing water, Zhong Ziqi said: \"How fine! Vast as the Yangtze and Yellow River!\" Whatever Boyi conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped it.\n\nOnce, Boyi was traveling along the northern slope of Mount Tai when he was suddenly caught in a violent storm. Taking shelter beneath a cliff, his heart filled with sorrow, and he took up his zither to play. First he composed a piece for ceaseless rain, then shifted to the sound of crumbling mountains. With each melody, Zhong Ziqi exhausted its meaning. Boyi then set down his zither and sighed: \"How excellent, how excellent is your listening! Your thoughts and imaginings are as my own heart. Where could I hide my music from you?\"\n\nKing Mu of Zhou went on a western expedition, crossing the Kunlun Mountains but not reaching Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, someone along the way presented a craftsman named Yanshi. The king summoned him and asked: \"What skills do you possess?\" Yanshi replied: \"I will do whatever Your Majesty commands. However, I have already made something I wish you to see first.\" The king said: \"Come with it tomorrow, and we shall view it together.\"\n\nThe next day, Yanshi was granted an audience. The king summoned him and asked: \"Who is this person accompanying you?\" He replied: \"This is my creation, one who can perform.\" The king stared in astonishment: it walked, bowed, and raised its head—truly human. When the craftsman pressed its chin, it sang in perfect tune; when he held its hand, it danced in perfect rhythm. Its transformations were endless, following every whim.\n\nThe king believed it to be a real person and, together with Lady Sheng and his inner attendants, observed its performance. As the act neared its end, the performer winked its eye and beckoned to the king’s concubines on either side. Enraged, the king immediately ordered Yanshi’s execution. Trembling in fear, Yanshi at once dismantled the performer before the king, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. The king examined it closely: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and hair—all artificial, yet none missing. When reassembled, it appeared as before. The king then tested it: removing its heart, its mouth could not speak; removing its liver, its eyes could not see; removing its kidneys, its feet could not walk. Only then did King Mu smile in wonder and exclaim, \"Can human skill truly rival the work of creation?\" He ordered a secondary chariot to carry it back.\n\nAs for Lu Ban’s cloud ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite, they had deemed their craftsmanship unsurpassable. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yanshi’s artistry, they reported it to their masters. From that day forth, the two never dared speak of their skills again, but instead constantly wielded compass and square.\n\nGan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and cause beasts to crouch and birds to descend. His disciple Fei Wei, who studied under Gan Ying, surpassed his teacher in skill. Another disciple, Ji Chang, in turn learned archery from Fei Wei. Fei Wei instructed him, \"First master the art of not blinking, then we may speak of archery.\" Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, fixing his gaze upon the suspended treadle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip brushed his eyelashes, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei, who said, \"Not yet. You must next learn to see—see the small as large, the faint as distinct—then come tell me.\" Ji Chang hung a louse from the window with a yak hair and faced south to observe it. Within ten days, it seemed to grow larger; after three years, it appeared as big as a cartwheel. All else he beheld seemed like mountains and hills. He then took a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reed, shot the louse, and pierced its heart without breaking the hair. He told Fei Wei, who leapt up, clapped his chest, and cried, \"You have mastered it!\"\n\nAfter Ji Chang had fully learned Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that in all the world, only one man could rival him. He plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wild, and the two exchanged arrows. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground without stirring dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. Ji Chang loosed one final arrow, but Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn, missing not a hair. Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, bowed to each other on the road, and pledged to become father and son. They swore an oath, cutting their arms, never to teach their art to another.\n\nZaofu’s master was named Taidou. When Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with utmost humility, yet Taidou did not instruct him for three years. Zaofu’s reverence only deepened, until Taidou finally said, \"An ancient poem says, ‘The son of a fine bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a fine smelter must first sew furs.’ First observe my steps. When you can move as I do, then you may hold the six reins and drive the six horses.\" Zaofu replied, \"I shall follow your command.\" Taidou then set up a path of wooden planks, just wide enough for his feet, measured in steps and laid out. He walked upon it, running back and forth without stumbling. Zaofu learned this in three days, mastering its skill. Taidou sighed, \"How quick you are! You have grasped it swiftly. All charioteering is like this.\"\n\nIn your former practice, you grasped it with your feet and responded with your heart. Extending this to charioteering, you harmonize the reins and bits with perfect accord, adjusting swiftness and slowness to the harmony of the lips and tongue. You establish the proper measure within your breast and hold the rhythm in your grasp. Internally, you attain it in your center, and externally, you align with the horse’s will. Thus, you can advance and retreat as if treading a cord, turn and curve as if compass-drawn, traverse great distances with energy to spare—truly, you have mastered the art.\n\nYou grasp it in the bit and respond with the reins; you grasp it in the reins and respond with your hands; you grasp it in your hands and respond with your heart. Then, without relying on your eyes or urging with the whip, your mind is at ease, your body upright, the six reins unconfused, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, advancing, or retreating, nothing fails to meet the rhythm. Thereafter, beyond the wheels of your chariot, no trace of tracks remains; beyond the hooves of your horses, no ground is left untouched. You will never perceive the peril of mountains and valleys or the flatness of plains and open land—they will all appear as one. My art is exhausted; remember it well.\n\nWei Hei’luan, on account of a private grudge, killed Qiu Bingzhang. Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Lai Dan’s qi was fierce, his form exposed; he ate by counting grains and moved with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact revenge, for he disdained to borrow strength from others. He swore to slaughter Hei’luan with his own hands and sword.\n\nHei’luan’s ferocity surpassed all others, his strength equal to a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh were not of mortal kind. He would stretch his neck to meet the blade, bare his chest to receive arrows, yet even when the point bent against him, his body bore no mark or wound. Confident in his strength, he regarded Lai Dan as a mere fledgling.\n\nLai Dan’s friend, Shen Tuo, said, “Your hatred for Hei’luan is profound, and his underestimation of you is excessive. What plan will you devise?” Lai Dan wept and replied, “I beg you to devise one for me.” Shen Tuo said, “I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, possesses a treasured sword from the Yin emperor. When a mere youth wore it, he repelled the armies of three hosts. Why not seek it from him?”\n\nLai Dan then went to Wei and met Kong Zhou, serving him with the rites of a charioteer. He first offered his wife and children as collateral, then stated his desire. Kong Zhou said, “I have three swords; choose whichever you wish. None can kill a man, but let me first describe their forms.\n\nThe first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light). When you look at it, it cannot be seen; when you wield it, you do not know it is there. Where it touches, it vanishes without boundary, passing through things without their awareness.\n\nThe second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow). At the break of dawn, in the mingling of light and dark, or at dusk, in the blending of day and night, if you face north and observe it, faintly, as if something exists, yet its form cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound, passing through things without harming them.\n\nThe third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Silk). In daylight, you see its shadow but not its light; at night, you see its light but not its form. Where it touches, it passes through swiftly, closing instantly behind it, leaving a sensation of speed but no bloodshed.\n\nThese three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They lie sealed in their caskets, never unsealed.” Lai Dan said, “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”\n\nKong Zhou then returned Lai Dan’s wife and children and fasted with him for seven days. At dusk, he knelt and presented the lowest sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed.\n\nLai Dan then took the sword and approached Hei’luan. At that time, Hei’luan was drunk, sprawled beneath a window. Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist, yet Hei’luan felt nothing. Taking Hei’luan for dead, Lai Dan hurried away. At the gate, he encountered Hei’luan’s son and struck him three times, as if thrusting into emptiness. Hei’luan’s son laughed and said, “Why are you so foolish as to wave at me thrice?” Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.\n\nWhen Hei’luan awoke, he raged at his wife, “You let me drink until I exposed myself! Now my throat is sore and my waist stiff.” His son said, “Earlier, Lai Dan came and met me at the gate. He waved at me three times, and now my body aches and my limbs are stiff. He must have cast a curse on me!”\n\nKing Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong. The Western Rong presented him with a *Kun Wu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword was a foot and a handspan in length, its blade forged of refined steel and glowing red. When used, it cut jade as if it were mud. The fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire. The cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime turns the color of the cloth. When removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as if pure snow.\n\nThe Crown Prince believed no such things existed and dismissed the accounts as false. Xiao Shu said, “Your Highness is too certain in your own judgment, too quick to dismiss reason!” *The Central Scroll of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue* concludes here.\n\n**Force and Fate, Sixth Chapter**\n\nForce said to Fate, “What are your achievements compared to mine?”\n\nFate replied, “What have you ever done for things that you would compare yourself to me?”\n\nForce said, “Longevity or early death, success or failure, high or low status, wealth or poverty—all these are within my power.”\n\nFate said, “The wisdom of Peng Zu did not surpass that of Yao or Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years. The talent of Yan Yuan did not fall below that of the common crowd, yet he lived but thirty-two years. The virtue of Confucius did not fall below that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged between Chen and Cai. The conduct of King Zhou of Yin did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng monopolized the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved at Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew richer than Zhan Qin. If all these are within your power, why do you grant long life to one and early death to another, thwart the worthy and advance the perverse, debase the wise and exalt the foolish, impoverish the good and enrich the wicked?”\n\nForce said, “If this is so, then I truly have no power over things. Yet if things are as they are, is this not your doing?”\n\nFate said, “Since it is called Fate, how could there be one who controls it? I merely push forward the straight and let the crooked take their course. Longevity or early death, success or failure, high or low status, wealth or poverty—all arise of themselves. How could I comprehend them? How could I comprehend them?”\n\nBeigongzi said to Ximenzi, “You and I are of the same generation, yet you are esteemed by others. We belong to the same clan, yet you are respected. We share the same appearance, yet you are beloved. We speak alike, yet your words are heeded. We act alike, yet your conduct is trusted. We both serve in office, yet you are honored. We both till the soil, yet you grow wealthy. We both engage in trade, yet you profit. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain, dwell in a thatched hut, and travel on foot. You wear embroidered brocade, feast on fine millet and meat, reside in a mansion with towering beams, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you are cheerful and seem to scorn me; at court, you are haughty and display contempt for me. You do not seek my favor, nor do we stroll together—this has been so for years. Do you consider your virtue superior to mine?”\n\nXimenzi replied, “I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of our differing fates? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is thick indeed.”\n\nBeigongzi had no reply. He departed in dismay.\n\nOn the road, he encountered Master Dongguo. The master said, “Where have you been, that you return with such a dejected gait and a look of deep shame?”\n\nBeigongzi recounted what had happened.\n\nMaster Dongguo said, “I will relieve your shame. Let us go together to Ximen’s house and question him. Say: ‘Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi?’ Speak plainly.”\n\nXimenzi said, “Beigongzi claims we share the same generation, clan, age, appearance, speech, and conduct, yet our status and wealth differ. I told him: ‘I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of our differing fates? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is thick indeed.’”\n\nMaster Dongguo said, “Your notion of ‘fate’ refers only to differences in talent and virtue. My notion of ‘fate’ is different. Beigongzi is rich in virtue but poor in fate; you are rich in fate but poor in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Yet you boast of your favorable fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his virtue—neither of you understands the principle of what is inherently so.”\n\nXimenzi said, “Enough, Master. I dare not speak further.”\n\nAfter Beigongzi returned home, he wore his coarse hemp, which was as warm as fox or raccoon fur. He ate his coarse beans, which tasted as fine as rice and millet. He sheltered in his thatched hut, which shaded like a grand hall. He rode in his humble cart, which seemed as ornate as a carved chariot. For the rest of his life, he remained content, unaware of honor or disgrace lying in others rather than himself.\n\nMaster Dongguo, hearing of this, said, “Beigongzi has slept for a long time. A single word awakened him—how easily he was enlightened!”\n\nGuan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were close friends, bound by deep affection, and both lived in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi ruling house had many favored sons, with legitimate and illegitimate heirs competing. The people feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Later, when Duke Wuzhi rebelled and Qi was left without a ruler, the two princes raced to return. Guan Yiwu fought Xiaobai on the road to Ju, shooting an arrow that struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he pressured Lu to kill Prince Jiu. Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.\n\nBao Shuya said to Duke Huan, “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.”\n\nDuke Huan replied, “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.”\n\nBao Shuya said, “I have heard that a worthy ruler harbors no personal grudges. Moreover, one who serves his lord faithfully will surely serve his ruler well. If you wish to become a hegemon, you cannot do without Yiwu. You must pardon him.”\n\nThereupon, Duke Huan summoned Guan Zhong. When Lu returned him to Qi, Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the city gates and freed him from his bonds. Duke Huan treated him with honor, placing him above Gao and Guo. Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs and addressing him as “Father Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed, saying, “When I was young and poor, I once traded with Bao Shuya, taking more than my share of the profits. Bao Shuya did not think me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shuya that led to great failure. He did not think me foolish, knowing that circumstances have their favorable and unfavorable moments. I was employed three times and dismissed three times by my lords. Bao Shuya did not think me worthless, knowing I had not met with the right time. I fought three battles and fled three times. He did not think me cowardly, knowing I had an elderly mother to care for. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I was imprisoned and humiliated. Bao Shuya did not think me shameless, knowing I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name were not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shuya truly knew me.”\n\nThis is why the world praises Guan and Bao for their fine friendship, and Xiaobai for his skill in employing the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable. There was no fine friendship, no skill in employing the capable—it was not that there was some other fine friendship or skill in employing the capable. Shao Hu did not choose to die; he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy; he had no choice but to recommend them. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy; he had no choice but to employ him.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Xiaobai visited him and said, “Father Zhong’s illness is grave. You must not conceal it. If it becomes critical, to whom should I entrust the state?”\n\nYiwu asked, “Whom do you wish to appoint?”\n\nXiaobai said, “Bao Shuya will do.”\n\nYiwu replied, “He will not do. He is a man of integrity and a fine gentleman. Toward those who are not his equal, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of a person’s faults, he never forgets them for the rest of his life.”\n\nIf you appoint him to govern the state, above he will entangle his lord, below he will oppose the people. His offense against his lord will not be long in coming.”\n\nXiaobai said, “Then who will do?”\n\nYiwu replied, “If you must have someone, then Yang Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his lord, below he does not betray the people. He feels shame before those who surpass him like the Yellow Emperor and pities those who fall short of him. To share virtue with others is called a sage; to share wealth with others is called a worthy. To rule others with worth is never to win them; to humble oneself before others with worth is never to fail to win them. In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see. If you must have someone, then Xi Peng will do.”\n\nYet Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shuya—he had no choice but to slight him; nor did he favor Xi Peng—he had no choice but to favor him. To favor at the outset may lead to slighting in the end; to slight at the outset may lead to favoring in the end. The coming and going of favor and slight are not of my doing.\n\nDeng Xi wielded arguments of dual possibility, crafting endless words. When Zichan held office, Deng composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*. The state of Zheng adopted it, repeatedly challenging Zichan’s governance. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan seized and executed him, then shortly after put him to death. Yet Zichan did not choose to use the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he had no choice but to use it; Deng Xi did not choose to yield to Zichan—he had no choice but to yield; Zichan did not choose to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to execute him.\n\nTo live when one ought to live is Heaven’s blessing; to die when one ought to die is Heaven’s blessing. To live when one ought not to live is Heaven’s punishment; to die when one ought not to die is Heaven’s punishment. To live when one can live, to die when one can die—such cases exist. To be unable to live, unable to die—yet to live or die—such cases exist as well. Yet life and death, life and death, are neither of things nor of the self; all is fate. Where wisdom is powerless, it is said:\n\n“Profound and boundless,\nthe Dao of Heaven meets of itself;\nvast and undivided,\nthe Dao of Heaven moves of itself.\nNeither Heaven nor Earth can transgress it,\nneither sages nor wisdom can interfere,\nneither ghosts nor spirits can deceive.\nThat which is natural—silently it completes,\ncalmly it pacifies,\nleading and guiding it.”\n\nYang Zhu’s friend Ji Liang fell ill, and after seven days, his condition worsened. His sons gathered around weeping and summoned physicians. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu, “My sons are so unworthy—why do you not sing for them to enlighten them?”\n\nYang Zhu sang:\n“Heaven does not know—\nhow could man be aware?\nNot blessing from Heaven,\nnot misfortune from man.\nI or you—\nwho understands?\nPhysician or shaman—\ndo they know?”\n\nHis sons did not understand, so they finally consulted three physicians. The first was named Jiao, the second Yu, and the third Lu. They diagnosed his illness.\n\nJiao said to Ji Liang, “Your cold and warmth are unregulated, your deficiency and excess are disordered. Your illness arises from hunger and satiety, lust and desire, and the scattering of essence and thought—neither Heaven nor ghosts are to blame. Though grave, it can be treated.”\n\nJi Liang said, “A common physician,” and promptly dismissed him.\n\nYu said, “At first, your prenatal qi was insufficient, while your mother’s milk was excessive. This illness did not arise in a single day or night—its causes accumulated gradually, and it cannot be cured.”\n\nJi Liang said, “A fine physician,” and kept him to dine.\n\nLu said, “Your illness arises neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. From the moment you received life and took form, there has been one who governs it, and one who knows it. What can medicine or stone do for you?”\n\nJi Liang said, “A divine physician,” and sent him off with generous gifts.\n\nSoon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved on its own.\n\nLife is not preserved by what one values, nor is the body diminished by what one holds light. Thus, what one values may not sustain life, while what one despises may not bring death; what one cherishes may not bring depth, while what one scorns may not bring shallowness. This appears contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, depth and shallowness, arise of themselves. Some live because they are valued, some die because they are despised; some grow deep because they are cherished, some grow shallow because they are scorned. This appears natural, yet it is not—life and death, depth and shallowness, likewise arise of themselves.\n\nZhu Xiong said to King Wen, “What is long is not made so by addition, what is short is not made so by reduction. What is lost in calculation—what does it matter?”\n\nLaozi said to Guan Yin, “Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests? To speak of aligning with Heaven’s intent, to weigh profit and harm, is not as good as ceasing altogether.”\n\nYang Bu asked, “Consider a man here: in age, he and his brother are the same; in speech, they are the same; in talent, they are the same; in appearance, they are the same. Yet in lifespan, they are as father and son; in rank, they are as father and son; in reputation, they are as father and son; in love and hate, they are as father and son. I am perplexed by this.”\n\nYangzi said, “The ancients had a saying, which I have come to understand and will tell you: what is so without knowing why it is so—this is fate. Now, in confusion and obscurity, in a tangle of indistinctness, one follows what is done and what is not done.”\n\nDay departs, day arrives—who can know its reason? All is fate. Those who trust in fate are without notions of long or short life; those who trust in principle are without notions of right or wrong; those who trust in the heart are without notions of compliance or defiance; those who trust in nature are without notions of safety or peril. This is called being without any fixed reliance, without any fixed distrust. Truly sincere and earnest—what should one reject, what should one embrace? What should one lament, what should one rejoice in? What should one do, what should one not do?\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The perfected person abides as though dead, moves as though a machine. They do not know why they abide, nor why they do not abide; they do not know why they move, nor why they do not move. They do not alter their demeanor because of the gaze of the multitude, nor do they claim that their demeanor remains unchanged because the multitude does not gaze upon them. Alone they come, alone they go, alone they enter, alone they depart—who can obstruct them?\"\n\nMo Yin, Mei Chi, Chi Yi, and Nü—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never knew one another’s true feelings, each believing their own wisdom to be profound. Qiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nü Yu, and Pian Pi—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never spoke of guarding their words, each believing their own cunning to be subtle. Liao He, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never awakened to one another’s understanding, each believing their own talent to be sufficient. Mian Ting, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never reproached one another, each believing their own conduct to be without fault. Duo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never glanced at one another, each believing the times to be in accord with them.\n\nThese are the manifold dispositions of the world—their appearances are not uniform, yet all return to the Dao, for fate is where they converge. That which seems to succeed does so by chance, not by inherent success; that which seems to fail does so by chance, not by inherent failure. Thus confusion arises from chance, and in the moment of chance, all is obscure. If, in the midst of chance, one remains unobscured, then one is neither startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. Moving with the times, halting with the times—wisdom cannot fathom it.\n\nThose who trust in fate harbor no duality between self and other. Those who harbor duality between self and other would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, to turn their backs on cliffs and face the moat—even then, they would not stumble. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate; poverty and hardship come from the times. To resent an early death is to not know fate; to resent poverty and hardship is to not know the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing fate and being at peace with the times.\n\nIf one makes the wise calculate gains and losses, assess emptiness and fullness, gauge human sentiments, they may succeed or fail—yet both outcomes will be fitting. If one makes the unwise not calculate gains and losses, not assess emptiness and fullness, not gauge human sentiments, they too may succeed or fail—yet both outcomes will be fitting. Whether one calculates or not, assesses or not, gauges or not—what difference does it make? Only when there is neither calculation nor its absence can one be whole and without loss. Yet this is not knowing wholeness, nor knowing loss. One is whole of oneself, one loses of oneself, one perishes of oneself.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi traveled to Ox Mountain. Gazing north over his capital, he wept and sighed: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I ever leave it and die?\" His attendants, Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju, both wept with him, saying: \"We rely on our lord’s grace. Though we eat coarse meat, ride broken-down chariots, and mount worn-out horses, we still do not wish to die—how much less our lord?\" Only Yanzi laughed beside them.\n\nThe duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: \"Today’s outing has saddened me. Kong and Ju wept with me, yet you alone laugh—why?\" Yanzi replied: \"If worthy rulers could always preserve this land, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still possess it. If brave rulers could always preserve it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still possess it. Had these rulers preserved it, would you now be standing here in straw cloak and hat, tilling the fields, fretting over affairs, and dreading death? How then would you have come to occupy this position? It is because rulers alternately hold and relinquish it. Yet you alone weep for it—this is unkind. To see an unkind ruler and flattering ministers—these are the two things I secretly laugh at.\"\n\nDuke Jing was ashamed. He raised his cup to punish himself and made his two ministers each drink two cups as well.\n\nAmong the people of Wei was one Dongmen Wu, whose son died yet he did not grieve. His steward said: \"No one in the world loved their child more than you. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son, and in that time, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?\"\n\nFarmers rush to the seasons, merchants pursue profit, artisans chase skill, officials chase power—circumstances compel them. Yet farmers face drought and flood, merchants face gain and loss, artisans face success and failure, officials face favor and disfavor—fate compels them.\n\n---\n\nYang Zhu, Part Seven\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged with the Meng family. Meng asked: \"A man is but a man—why must he have a name?\" Yang Zhu replied: \"A name is for becoming wealthy.\" \"Once wealthy, why not stop?\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"For honor.\"\n\"Once honored, why not stop?\"\n\"For death.\"\n\"Once dead, what is there to do?\"\n\"For descendants.\"\n\"What benefit does a name bring to descendants?\"\n\"A name brings suffering to the body and weariness to the heart. Yet those who ride upon a name bestow blessings upon their clan, extend benefits to their village, and all the more to their descendants. Generally, those who pursue a name must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who pursue a name must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.\"\n\nMeng said: \"When Guan Zhong served as minister to the Duke of Qi, if the ruler was dissolute, he was dissolute; if the ruler was extravagant, he was extravagant. Their wills aligned, their words followed, and the Dao was enacted—thus the state became hegemonic. Yet after his death, only the Guan family remained. When the Tian family served as ministers to the Duke of Qi, if the ruler was full, they diminished themselves; if the ruler levied taxes, they distributed alms. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess the state of Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without end. If genuine fame leads to poverty, then false fame leads to wealth.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Genuine substance lacks fame, and fame lacks substance. Fame is but falsity. In ancient times, Yao and Shun falsely offered the world to Xu You and Shan Juan, yet did not lose the world and enjoyed a reign of a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi genuinely relinquished the rulership of Guzhu, yet ultimately lost their state and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between genuine and false is as clear as this.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"A hundred years is the greatest span of life. Among a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, from infancy to senility, nearly half is spent thus. The time lost to nightly sleep and daytime oblivion is nearly another half. Pain, illness, sorrow, loss, worry, and fear occupy yet another half. Measuring these few years, the moments of unburdened ease and self-contentment, free from even the slightest concern, are but fleeting. Then for what does man live? For what does he delight? For fine food and comfort? For music and beauty? Yet fine food and comfort cannot always satisfy, nor can music and beauty always be enjoyed. Then one is further constrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or withdrawn by fame and law, anxiously competing for an ephemeral reputation in one’s time, scheming for posthumous glory. Cautiously guarding what the ears hear and the eyes see, sparing the body and mind from judgment, one merely forfeits the supreme joy of the present, unable to indulge even for a moment. Bound in heavy shackles, how is this different from imprisonment?\n\nThe people of great antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn and death a brief departure. Thus they followed their hearts and acted without resisting their natural desires. The joys of the present were not forsaken, so they were not swayed by fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, not opposing the inclinations of the myriad things. Posthumous renown was not sought, so they were not touched by punishments. Fame and reputation, longevity and brevity—these were not their concern.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"What distinguishes the myriad things is life; what they share is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are their differences. In death, there is putrefaction and decay—this they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base are not of their own making, nor are putrefaction and decay. Thus life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies, worthiness is not what one is worthy, foolishness is not what one is foolish, nobility is not what one is noble, baseness is not what one is base. Yet the myriad things equally live, equally die, equally are worthy, equally are foolish, equally are noble, equally are base. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is sagely and benevolent or cruel and foolish, in life one may be Yao or Shun, in death one is but rotting bones; in life one may be Jie or Zhou, in death one is but rotting bones. All is the same—who knows the difference? Therefore, hasten to the present life—why concern oneself with what comes after death?\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Boyi did not lack desire; his insistence on purity led him to starve. Zhan Ji did not lack emotion; his insistence on chastity led to the decline of his lineage. The errors of purity and chastity lie in this.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu, while Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, and Zigong’s wealth burdened his body. Thus neither poverty nor wealth is acceptable—where then lies what is acceptable?\"\nHe replied: \"What is acceptable lies in delighting in life and easing the body. Therefore, those who delight in life are not impoverished, and those who ease the body do not amass wealth.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"An ancient saying goes: 'In life, we cherish one another; in death, we cast one another aside.' This saying is perfect. The way of cherishing is not merely about affection—it is about diligence bringing ease, hunger bringing satiety, cold bringing warmth, and poverty bringing success. The way of casting aside is not about lack of sorrow—it is about not burying pearls and jade, not dressing in embroidered silks, not offering sacrificial animals, and not preparing funerary objects.\"\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu said: \"Let it be free—do not obstruct or restrain it.\"\nYan Pingzhong said: \"What does this entail?\"\nYiwu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they desire to hear, the eyes in what they desire to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it desires to speak, the body in what it desires for comfort, and the mind in what it desires to do. What the ears desire to hear is sound, and if they cannot, it is called obstructing hearing. What the eyes desire to see is beauty, and if they cannot, it is called obstructing sight. What the nose desires to smell is fragrance, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing scent. What the mouth desires to express is right and wrong, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing wisdom. What the body desires for comfort is fine food and ease, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing comfort. What the mind desires to do is indulgence, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing nature. All these obstructions are the tyrants of oppression. Remove these oppressive tyrants, and await death in carefree ease—whether a day, a month, a year, or a decade—this is what I call nurturing.\"\n\nTo cling to these oppressive tyrants, holding fast without release, living in distress to prolong life—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing.\n\nGuan Yiwu asked, \"I have already heard your teachings on nurturing life, but how should one send off the dead?\"\nYan Pingzhong replied, \"The rites for sending off the dead are simple—what more is there to say?\"\nGuan Yiwu said, \"I still wish to hear of it.\"\nPingzhong said, \"Once dead, how does it concern me? Burn the body, and it is acceptable; sink it, and it is acceptable; bury it, and it is acceptable; expose it, and it is acceptable; wrap it in firewood and cast it into a ravine, and it is acceptable; dress it in embroidered robes and enclose it in a stone outer coffin, and it is acceptable—whatever one encounters will do.\"\n\nGuan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu and Huangzi and said, \"The Dao of life and death—we two have now advanced in understanding it.\"\n\nZichan served as minister of Zheng, governing the state’s affairs. After three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformation, the wicked feared his prohibitions, and Zheng was well-ordered, so that the feudal lords stood in awe of it. Yet he had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.\n\nIn Chao’s chambers, wine was amassed by the thousand *zhong*, yeast piled like hills; from a hundred paces outside the gate, the scent of sweet liquor assailed the nose. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, the regrets and resentments of human affairs, the prosperity or ruin of his household, the closeness or distance of his nine clans, or the sorrows and joys of survival and loss. Even if water and fire, weapons and blades clashed before him, he remained unaware.\n\nMu’s rear courtyard contained dozens of adjoining chambers, all filled with women chosen for their youthful beauty, their grace and allure. When he was engrossed in sensual pleasures, he shunned his kin, severed ties with friends, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, and even then, his desires were not fully satisfied. If there was a maiden of exceptional beauty in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and only cease if he failed to obtain her.\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi and consulted him, saying, \"I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this means beginning with what is near and proceeding to what is far. I have brought order to the state, yet my family remains in chaos. Is my Dao perverse? What method can save these two?\"\nDeng Xi replied, \"I have long been perplexed by this but dared not speak first. Why do you not admonish them in due time, explaining the weight of life and destiny, and guiding them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?\"\n\nZichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Taking advantage of an opportunity, he met with his brothers and said to them, \"What makes humans noble above beasts is wisdom. What wisdom guides is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and rank follow. But if one acts on impulse, indulging in desires, then life and destiny are imperiled. If you heed my words, by morning you will repent, and by evening you will enjoy emoluments.\"\n\nChao and Mu replied, \"We have long known this and have long deliberated on it—do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, while death comes easily. Clinging to this hard-won life while awaiting an easily met death—how can one not ponder this deeply? Yet you wish to exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, to feign refinement and seek fame. We consider this no better than death. We desire to exhaust life’s joys and fulfill the pleasures of our years, fearing only that our bellies will be too full to drink our fill, our strength too spent to indulge our passions. We have no leisure to worry about disgraceful reputations or the peril to our lives. Moreover, you boast of your ability to govern the state, seeking to sway our hearts with fine words and delight us with honors and emoluments—is this not base and pitiable? We wish to part ways with you on this.\n\nThose who excel at governing externals may not bring order to things, yet their own bodies suffer; those who excel at governing internals may not bring chaos to things, yet their natures find ease. Your method of governing externals may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our method of governing internals can be extended to all under heaven, and the Dao of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to explain this art to you, yet you instead seek to instruct us with that art?\"\n\nZichan was left speechless. Later, he told Deng Xi, who said, \"You have dwelled with true persons yet do not recognize them—who would call you wise? The order of Zheng is mere coincidence, not your achievement.\"\n\nDuanmu Shu of Wei was a descendant of Zigong. Relying on his family’s wealth, his household amassed ten thousand gold pieces. He did not manage worldly affairs but gave free rein to his inclinations.\n\nWhatever the people desired to do, whatever human inclinations longed to enjoy—he did it all, he indulged in it all. His walls and chambers, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. As for what his heart truly desired, what his ears longed to hear, his eyes to see, his mouth to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote regions, from places where Qi’s soil did not nurture it, he would inevitably obtain it, as if it were but a thing within his garden walls. When he traveled, though mountains and rivers blocked his path, though the roads were long and winding, he would inevitably go, as if it were but a few steps from his door. Daily, a hundred guests filled his halls; his kitchens never ceased their smoke and flame, his halls never stilled their music.\n\nAfter providing for his own needs, he first distributed the surplus to his clan; after the clan was satisfied, he next gave to his village; and after the village was provided for, he then scattered the rest throughout the state. At sixty, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs, dispersing his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, and concubines. Within a year, all was gone—he left no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, there were no medicines stored; when he died, there were no funds for burial. The people of the state who had received his gifts gathered to contribute, returning his wealth to his descendants.\n\nQin Guli heard of this and said, \"Duanmu Shu is a madman—he has shamed his ancestors.\" Duan Yu Sheng heard of it and said, \"Mu Shu is an enlightened man—his virtue surpasses that of his ancestors. What he did, what he pursued, may shock the common mind, yet it is truly in accord with principle.\"\n\nMany of the gentlemen of Wei held fast to ritual and teaching, yet none could fathom this man’s heart.\n\nMengsun Yang asked Master Yang, \"Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking not to die—would that be acceptable?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"In principle, there is no not-dying.\"\n\"Then seeking long life—would that be acceptable?\"\n\"In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body made whole by cherishing it. And what is the use of long life? The five emotions—likes and dislikes—are the same now as in ancient times; the safety or peril of the four limbs is the same now as in ancient times; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs are the same now as in ancient times; the shifts between order and chaos are the same now as in ancient times. You have heard of these things, you have seen them, you have experienced them—yet you still find a hundred years too long. How much more would you resent the suffering of an even longer life?\"\n\nMengsun Yang said, \"If that is so, then swift death is better than long life. Then to tread upon blades, to plunge into boiling water—would that fulfill one’s will?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"Not so. Once born, let go and follow it, exhausting what you desire until death comes. When death approaches, let go and follow it, exhausting where it leads until all is spent. Let go of everything, follow everything—why rush between early or late?\"\n\nYang Zhu said, \"Bo Chengzi Gao did not use even a hair’s benefit for others, abandoning his state to live in reclusion and till the soil. Great Yu did not use his own body for self-benefit, leaving one side of his body withered. The ancients would not give up even a hair to benefit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve a single body. If each person does not give up even a hair, if each person does not benefit the world, the world will be well-ordered.\"\n\nQinzi asked Yang Zhu, \"If you could pluck a single hair from your body to save the world, would you do it?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.\"\nQinzi said, \"But if it could be saved, would you do it?\"\nMaster Yang did not answer.\n\nQinzi went out and told Mengsun Yang, saying, \"You do not understand the Master’s heart—I will explain it to you. Suppose someone could gain ten thousand gold pieces by harming your flesh—would you do it?\"\nMengsun Yang said, \"I would.\"\nQinzi said, \"Suppose you could gain a state by severing one of your limbs—would you do it?\"\nQinzi fell silent for a moment. Mengsun Yang said, \"A single hair is less than flesh, flesh is less than a limb—this is obvious. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that flesh is formed, by accumulating flesh that limbs are formed. A single hair is but one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you treat it lightly?\"\n\nQinzi said, \"I cannot answer you. But if you asked Lao Dan or Guan Yin with your words, your words would be correct. If I asked Yu or Mo Di with my words, my words would be correct.\"\n\nMengsun Yang then turned to his disciples and spoke of other matters.\n\nYang Zhu said, \"The world’s praise gathers upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius; its blame gathers upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize—his four limbs never knew a moment’s rest, his mouth and belly never tasted fine fare. His parents were not at ease, his younger siblings were not close. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom already in decline. When Shangjun proved unworthy, he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man exhausted with suffering. Gun’s work in governing the waters and lands was not completed, and he was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his task, avenging his father’s grudge, focusing only on the wild lands’ labor. His son was not raised, he passed his door without entering, his body was withered on one side, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he lived in a humble palace, wore plain robes and caps, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man burdened with toil. After King Wu died, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou took up the Son of Heaven’s governance. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors. He lived in the east for three years, executing his elder brother and exiling his younger brother, barely escaping with his life, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man filled with peril and fear. Confucius clarified the Way of the emperors and kings, responding to the summons of the rulers of his time. He was barred from trees in Song, his traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, living in sorrow until his death.\"\n\nThese were the harried and hastened among Heaven’s people. All four of those sages lived without a single day of joy, yet died with names enduring for ten thousand generations. A name, however, is not what reality seeks. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a stump or clod of earth.\n\nJie inherited generations of wealth, occupying the honored seat of the sovereign. His wisdom sufficed to overawe his subjects, his might to shake the realm within the seas. He indulged his ears and eyes to their fullest, exhausted every desire of his heart and mind, living in bliss until his death—this was the dissolute among Heaven’s people. Zhou, too, inherited generations of wealth, occupying the honored seat of the sovereign. His power knew no bounds, his will no defiance. He gave free rein to his passions in the *Qinggong*, indulged his desires through long nights, never burdening himself with ritual and righteousness, living in bliss until his execution—this was the wanton among Heaven’s people.\n\nThose two tyrants enjoyed the pleasures of following every desire in life, yet died bearing the names of fools and brutes. Reality, however, is not what names bestow. Though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how were they different from a stump or clod of earth? Those four sages, though the destination of all praise, suffered to the end, yet all alike met death. Those two tyrants, though the destination of all blame, reveled to the end, yet all alike met death.\n\nYang Zhu met with King Hui of Liang and declared, “Governing the world is as easy as turning something in the palm of your hand.” The king replied, “You cannot even govern one wife and one concubine, nor tend three *mu* of garden—how can you claim governing the world is as easy as turning something in your palm?” Yang Zhu answered, “Have you seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, with a five-foot boy carrying a switch and following behind—they go east when he wishes east, west when he wishes west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch and following behind, they would not take a step forward. Moreover, I have heard: fish that can swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams; the great swan soars high and does not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aims are too lofty.”\n\nGreat bells and grand chimes cannot accompany frantic, bustling dances. Why? Their tones are too sparse. One who would govern great things does not govern trifles; one who would achieve great deeds does not fuss over small matters—this is what is meant.\n\nYang Zhu said: The affairs of the distant past have perished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not; the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams; the undertakings of the Three Kings now hide, now appear—of a hundred, not one is known. Even the matters of one’s own lifetime, some heard, some seen—of ten thousand, not one is known. The events before one’s eyes, some preserved, some discarded—of a thousand, not one is known. From the distant past to the present day, the years are too many to count. Since the time of Fuxi, over three hundred thousand years have passed—yet the wise and foolish, the fair and foul, success and failure, right and wrong, all have vanished, differing only in how swiftly they fade.\n\nTo pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to exhaust one’s spirit and body in pursuit of it, and to seek a lingering name for a few hundred years after death—how can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in such a life?\n\nYang Zhu said: Humans resemble the class of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. Among all living things, humans are the most spiritually endowed. Yet human claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh inadequate for self-protection, their speed and agility unable to escape harm or seize advantage. Lacking fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, they must rely on external things to nourish their nature, employing wisdom rather than brute force.\n\nThus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what force devalues is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not truly belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it. External things do not truly belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot but keep them. The body is the master of life; external things are the masters of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot claim ownership of the body; though one does not discard external things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of the body or things is to selfishly monopolize what belongs to the world.\n\nIs this not the way of the sage? To regard the body as belonging to the world, to regard things as belonging to the world—this is the way of the perfected person. This is what is called the utmost perfection.\n\nYang Zhu said: The people cannot rest because of four things: longevity, fame, rank, and wealth. Possessing these four, they fear ghosts, fear others, fear authority, and fear punishment—such are those who flee from themselves. Their lives may be taken or spared, but control lies outside them.\n\nIf one does not defy fate, why crave longevity? If one does not pride oneself on nobility, why crave fame? If one does not seek power, why crave rank? If one does not covet riches, why crave wealth? Such are those who follow the natural order. The world holds no opposition for them; control lies within.\n\nThus, the saying goes: If a person neither marries nor enters officialdom, half their desires fade. If a person lacks clothing and food, the way of ruler and subject ceases. A Zhou proverb says: A farmer can be killed by sitting idle. Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant way of life; eating beans and greens, he takes this as the height of flavor.\n\nCoarse and thick of flesh, with sinews knotted and limbs taut and tense—if such a one is suddenly placed amidst soft furs and silken curtains, offered fine grains and meats, orchids and citrus, the heart grows restless, the body vexed, and internal heat gives rise to illness. Should the lords of Shang and Lu exchange places with a field laborer, they would not endure even a single season before exhaustion overtook them. Thus, what the rustic finds at ease, what the rustic deems fair—these he calls unmatched under heaven.\n\nOnce in the state of Song there was a farmer who wore only tattered hemp to survive the winter. When spring came and the eastern fields called, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s vast halls and secluded chambers, of silk floss and fox furs. Turning to his wife, he said: “The warmth of the sun at one’s back—none know its worth. If I offered it to our lord, great reward would surely follow.” A wealthy man of the village told him: “Long ago, a man praised his fine wild beans, sweet flax stalks, water celery, and duckweed seeds to the local magnate. The magnate took them and tasted—his mouth stung, his belly ached, and all mocked and reviled him. The man was deeply shamed. You are of this kind.”\n\nYang Zhu said: “Grand houses, fine robes, rich flavors, fair faces—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Insatiable nature is the bane of yin and yang. Loyalty is not enough to secure a ruler; it is enough only to endanger oneself. Righteousness is not enough to benefit others; it is enough only to harm one’s own life. Peace for superiors does not arise from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty perishes. Benefit for others does not arise from righteousness, and so the name of righteousness is severed. The mutual peace of ruler and subject, the mutual benefit of self and others—this was the Way of antiquity.”\n\nMaster Yu said: “Abandon fame, and you will have no cares.” Laozi said: “Fame is but the guest of reality.” Yet the careless pursue fame without cease. If fame cannot be abandoned, can it not at least be treated as a guest? Now, with fame comes honor and glory; without fame, humiliation and disgrace. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; humiliation and disgrace bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are bound to reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can fame be treated as a guest? The true evil lies in clinging to fame at the cost of reality. Clinging to fame at the cost of reality will leave one so preoccupied with impending ruin that one cannot be saved—how much less can one dwell between ease and sorrow?\n\n---\n\n*Sayings Aligned* (Chapter Eight)\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Hushu Zilin. Hushu Zilin said: “If you understand how to hold back, then we may speak of how to conduct yourself.” Liezi said: “I wish to hear of holding back.” The master said: “Look at your shadow, and you will know.” Liezi turned and observed his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the form and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on oneself. This is what it means to hold back and yet be foremost.\n\nGuan Yin said to Master Liezi: “Fair words yield a fair echo; foul words yield a foul echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. Fame is the echo; the body is the shadow. Thus it is said: Be cautious in your words, for they will be answered. Be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed. Therefore, the sage observes the outward to know the inward, examines the past to know the future—this is the principle by which he knows beforehand. Measure lies within oneself; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them. Tang and Wu loved all under heaven, and so they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under heaven, and so they perished. This is what is verified. When verification and measure are both clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving not by the gate or walking not by the path. Seeking profit thus—is it not difficult?”\n\nI have observed the virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor, examined the records of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and weighed the words of learned scholars and worthy men. In all cases of survival and ruin, decline and rise, none have succeeded without following this Way.\n\nYan Hui said: “Those who inquire about the Way do so for wealth.” “Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—what need have I for the Way?” Master Liezi said: “Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Way, and so they perished. Fortunately, I have not yet spoken to you of this. A man without righteousness, who eats only to fill his belly, is no better than a chicken or a dog. To eat voraciously without purpose, with the stronger dominating—this is the way of birds and beasts. To be no better than chickens, dogs, birds, or beasts and yet desire others’ respect—this cannot be. If others do not respect you, then danger and disgrace will befall you.”\n\nLiezi had mastered archery and sought instruction from Master Guan Yin. The master said: “Do you know why you hit the mark?” He replied: “I do not.” Guan Yin said: “Not yet.” He withdrew and practiced. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin. The master said: “Do you know why you hit the mark?” Liezi said: “I know now.” Guan Yin said: “Good. Hold to this and do not lose it. This applies not only to archery but to governing a state and conducting oneself. Thus, the sage does not examine survival and ruin but examines their causes.”\n\nLiezi said: “Those of vibrant beauty are proud; those of great strength are aggressive. Neither can be spoken to of the Way. Thus, one does not speak of the Way to those with graying hair who have lost their way—how much less to the common run of men? Therefore, if one acts aggressively, none will instruct him. If none instruct him, he will be isolated and without aid. The worthy entrust matters to others, and so even in old age they do not decline, and even when wisdom is exhausted they do not falter. Thus, the difficulty in governing a state lies in knowing the worthy, not in being worthy oneself.”\n\nA man of Song crafted a mulberry leaf from jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its edges, stem, and veins were exquisitely detailed, its luster so fine that when mixed among real mulberry leaves, it could not be distinguished. This man then lived off his craft in the state of Song. Master Liezi heard of this and said: “If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, few things would have leaves.”\n\nThus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on cleverness or skill.\n\nWhen Master Liezi was impoverished, his countenance bore the pallor of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao, yet he dwells in your state in such straits. Might this not suggest that you do not favor men of worth?” Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed. Upon returning home, Liezi’s wife struck her breast and reproached him: “I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet here you are, starving, and when the ruler, moved by your plight, sends you food, you refuse it. Is this not fate?” Liezi smiled and said to her: “The ruler does not know me personally. He sent me grain only because of another’s words, and if he were to punish me, it would likewise be on another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.” In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\nThe Shi family of Lu had two sons: one devoted to learning, the other to military arts. The one fond of learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who accepted him and appointed him tutor to the noble scions. The one fond of military arts went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and made him military commander. Their salaries enriched the family, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.\n\nThe Meng family, neighbors of the Shi, also had two sons with the same pursuits, yet they were mired in poverty. Envying the Shi family’s success, they sought their advice on how to advance. The two sons truthfully told them what they had done. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The king said: “Nowadays, the feudal lords contend with force, and all they concern themselves with are arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin.” He then castrated the man and banished him. The other son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The marquis said: “My state is weak, hemmed in by powerful neighbors. I serve the great states and soothe the small ones—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I let you return unharmed, you would only go to another state and become a grave threat to me.” He then had the man’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.\n\nUpon their return, the father and sons of the Meng family beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi said: “Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your results differ—this is because you missed the moment, not because your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was once used may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. This use and disuse have no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and adapting to the times, responding to affairs without fixed methods—this depends on wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?” The Meng father and sons then relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: “We understand. Say no more.”\n\nDuke Wen of Jin went to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. His son, Chu, looked up to the sky and laughed. The duke asked why he laughed. Chu replied: “I was thinking of a neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home when, on the road, he saw a woman picking mulberry leaves. He was pleased and spoke to her, but when he turned to look at his wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I was laughing at this.” The duke grasped his meaning and called off the attack. He led his army back, but before they arrived, an enemy had already raided their northern border.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from banditry. There was a man named Xi Qi of Yong who could discern a bandit’s appearance, reading their intentions in the subtlest movements of their brows and lashes. The Marquis of Jin employed him to identify bandits, and not one in a thousand escaped his notice. The marquis was delighted and told Zhao Wenzi: “I have found a man who can eliminate all bandits in the state. Why would I need more?” Wenzi said: “If our lord relies on spies to catch bandits, the bandits will never be eradicated, and Xi Yong will surely not die a natural death.” Soon after, the bandits plotted together: “The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong.” They then joined forces to kill him.\n\nThe marquis, greatly alarmed upon hearing this, immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: “Just as you said, Xi Yong is dead. But what method should we use to capture bandits?” Wenzi replied: “There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: ‘One who sees the fish in the depths brings misfortune; one who predicts hidden things invites calamity.’ If you wish to have no bandits, it would be better to promote the worthy and employ them, so that instruction is clear above and transformation flows below. When the people have a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?” Thereupon, he appointed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\nConfucius, returning to Lu from Wei, rested his carriage by a bridge over the Yellow River and gazed at the water. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*, where fish and soft-shelled turtles could not swim, and giant turtles could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: “This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*. Fish and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim here, and giant turtles cannot dwell here. Surely it is too perilous to cross?” The man paid no heed, waded across, and emerged unharmed.\n\nConfucius asked him, “Is this a skill? Or do you possess some Daoist technique? How is it that you could enter and emerge unscathed?”\n\nThe man replied, “When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust; when I emerged, I relied once more on loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the surging waves, and I dared not act out of self-interest. This is why I could enter and emerge again.”\n\nConfucius said to his disciples, “Take heed, all of you: if even water can be crossed by one who embodies loyalty and trust, how much more so with people?”\n\nBai Gong asked Confucius, “Can one speak to others in subtle words?”\n\nConfucius did not answer.\n\nBai Gong asked again, “If a stone is thrown into water, what then?”\n\nConfucius said, “My skilled diver could retrieve it.”\n\nBai Gong said, “If water is poured into water, what then?”\n\nConfucius replied, “When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers mingle, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them.”\n\nBai Gong said, “Is it truly impossible to speak subtly with others?”\n\nConfucius said, “Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of words can do so. One who knows the meaning of words does not speak with mere words. Those who contend for fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the highest words transcend words, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial.”\n\nBai Gong, unable to prevail, later died in his bathhouse.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. Victorious, he captured the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren, and sent a messenger to report the news. Viscount Xiang was eating when the messenger arrived, and his expression turned troubled.\n\nHis attendant said, “Two cities fell in a single day—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord look troubled?”\n\nViscount Xiang said, “The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not last the morning; the midday sun does not linger. Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have not been cultivated over time, yet two cities fell in a single day. How long before ruin reaches us?”\n\nWhen Confucius heard of this, he said, “The Zhao house will flourish. For it is through worry that one flourishes, and through joy that one perishes. Victory is not the difficult part—maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all often triumphed, yet in the end they met their downfall, for they did not understand how to maintain victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can sustain it.”\n\nConfucius’s strength was such that he could force open the bolts of a city gate, yet he would not be known for his might. Mozi devised defenses against siege warfare, and Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he would not be known for his military skill. Thus, those who truly sustain victory make the strong appear weak.\n\nThere was a man of Song who diligently practiced benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. One day, his family’s black ox gave birth to a white calf. He asked Confucius about it, who said, “This is an auspicious omen. Offer it in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord.”\n\nA year later, the man’s father suddenly went blind. The ox again bore a white calf, and the father once more instructed his son to ask Confucius. The son said, “Last time, after asking, you lost your sight. Why ask again?”\n\nThe father replied, “The words of a sage first seem contrary but later align. The matter is not yet settled—go and ask again.”\n\nThe son returned to Confucius, who again said, “It is auspicious.” He instructed them to perform the sacrifice.\n\nThe son returned and reported this to his father, who said, “Do as Confucius says.”\n\nA year later, the son also went blind. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital, the people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. The able-bodied all mounted the walls to fight, and more than half perished. But this man, because both he and his father were afflicted, were spared. When the siege was lifted, their sight was restored.\n\nIn Song there was a man called Lanzi who offered his skills to Duke Yuan of Song. The duke summoned him and had him demonstrate his art. Using two poles twice the length of his body, he bound them to his shins, then ran swiftly forward and back, juggling seven swords, tossing them in succession so that five were always in the air. The duke was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed upon him gold and silk.\n\nAnother Lanzi, skilled in the art of the swallow’s flight, heard of this and also presented himself to the duke. The duke grew furious, saying, “Formerly, a man with extraordinary skills sought my favor. Though his art was of no use, it happened that I was in a joyful mood, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. This one must have heard of it and come seeking my favor again, hoping for another reward.” He had the man seized and was about to execute him, but after a month he released him.\n\nDuke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, “You are advanced in years. Among your descendants, is there anyone I might send to seek fine horses?” Bo Le replied, “A good horse can be known by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of the world—it is as if it vanishes, as if it disappears, as if it is lost, as if it never was. Such a horse leaves no dust, no tracks. My sons are all of mediocre talent; they can be taught to recognize a good horse, but not the horse of the world. There is one with whom I once shared the labor of gathering firewood and vegetables—his name is Jiu Fang Gao. In matters of horses, he is no less skilled than I. I beg you to meet him.”\n\nThe duke received him and sent him forth to seek a horse.\n\nAfter three months, he returned and reported, “I have found it—it is in Shaqiu.” Duke Mu asked, “What kind of horse is it?” He replied, “A yellow mare.” The duke sent someone to fetch it, but it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said to him, “A failure! The one you sent to seek a horse cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know a fine horse?”\n\nBo Le sighed deeply and said, “Has it truly come to this? This is why his ability surpasses mine a thousandfold, ten thousandfold, beyond measure. What Jiu Fang Gao observes is the heavenly mechanism. He grasps its essence and forgets its form, attends to its inner nature and disregards its outward appearance. He sees what is to be seen and does not see what is not to be seen; he looks at what is to be looked at and ignores what is not to be looked at. What Jiu Fang Gao appraises is something far more valuable than the horse itself.” When the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of the world.\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He, “How should one govern the state?” Zhan He replied, “I am enlightened in governance but not in governing the state.” King Zhuang said, “I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain—may I learn how to preserve them?” Zhan He replied, “I have never heard of one whose person is well-ordered yet whose state is in chaos, nor have I heard of one whose person is in disorder yet whose state is well-governed. Thus, the root lies in the self—I dare not speak of the branches.”\n\nThe king said, “Well said.”\n\nAn elder of Huqiu said to Shusun Ao, “There are three sources of resentment among men—do you know them?” Shusun Ao asked, “What are they?” The elder replied, “Those of high rank are envied; those in great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emoluments are beset by grievances.”\n\nShusun Ao said, “As my rank grows higher, my aspirations grow humbler; as my office grows greater, my heart grows smaller; as my emoluments grow richer, my generosity grows broader.”\n\nCan this avoid the three resentments?” Shusun Ao, gravely ill and near death, instructed his son, “The king has repeatedly offered to enfeoff me, but I have refused. When I die, the king will enfeoff you—you must not accept any land of advantage. Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qinqiu, a land of ill fortune with a most inauspicious name. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue are cunning; only this place can be held in perpetuity.”\n\nAfter Shusun Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son a fine domain. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead. It was granted, and to this day his descendants have not lost it.\n\nNiu Que was a great Confucian of Shangdang. Traveling down to Handan, he encountered bandits in the sands of Ou who seized all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away unhurried, his face cheerful, showing no sign of distress. The bandits approached and asked the reason. He replied, “A gentleman does not harm what sustains him for the sake of what sustains it.”\n\nThe bandits exclaimed, “Ah! Truly a worthy man!” Then they conferred among themselves: “With his worth, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and speaks of us, he will surely bring trouble upon us. Better to kill him.” So they pursued and slew him.\n\nWhen the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another, “If you meet bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang.” All took heed.\n\nShortly after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he fought them fiercely. When he could not prevail, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: “We spared your life—how generous!—yet you pursue us without end. Your tracks will betray us. Since we are already bandits, where is the benevolence in that?” They killed him and slaughtered four or five of his companions as well.\n\nThe Yu family was a wealthy household of Liang. Their wealth was abundant, their money and silks beyond measure, their treasures beyond estimation. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set out music and wine and played dice. As knights-errant passed by below, one of the gamblers on the tower shot a dice throw, hitting the bright marker squarely. The pieces were flipped, the wooden counters clacked, and they laughed—just as a kite swooped down and dropped a rotting rat, striking the target.\n\nThe knights-errant said to one another, “The Yu family has enjoyed wealth and pleasure for too long, yet they have always held others in contempt. They did not attack us directly but instead insulted us with a rotting rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no standing among the knights of the world.” They vowed as one, “Let us unite in purpose, lead our followers, and destroy their household utterly.”\n\nOn the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons, attacked the Yu family, and annihilated them.\n\nIn the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. As he set out on a journey, he grew hungry along the way. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu had eaten three times, he could finally see. He asked, “Who are you?”\n\n“I am Qiu of Hufu.”\n\nYuan Jingmu exclaimed, “Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I will not eat the food of a bandit on principle.” He pressed his hands to the ground and retched, but nothing came up. He coughed and gasped until, exhausted, he collapsed and died.\n\nThe man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To call the food “bandit’s food” simply because the man was a bandit, and thus refuse to eat, is to confuse name and reality.\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju. Believing the duke did not understand him, he left and dwelt by the sea. In summer he ate water caltrop and water chestnut; in winter he ate acorns. When Duke Ao of Ju faced calamity, Zhu Lishu took leave of his friends and went to die for him.\n\nHis friends said, “You left because you believed he did not understand you. Now you go to die for him—how is understanding or not understanding to be distinguished?”\n\nZhu Lishu replied, “Not so. I left because I believed he did not understand me. Now, if I die for him, it proves he truly did not understand me. I will die to shame those rulers of later generations who do not understand their ministers. To die for one who understands you, and not to die for one who does not—this is to follow the straight Way.”\n\nZhu Lishu may be called one who resented injustice to the point of forgetting himself.\n\nYang Zhu said, “Benefit given brings benefit in return; resentment sent forth brings harm in return. What is initiated here finds response abroad—only requests are exempt. Thus the worthy are cautious in what they put forth.”\n\nA neighbor of Master Yang lost a sheep. He led his own followers and also asked Master Yang’s servants to join the pursuit. Master Yang exclaimed, “Ah! To lose one sheep, why so many pursuers?”\n\nThe neighbor replied, “There are many branching paths.”\n\nWhen they returned, Master Yang asked, “Did you recover the sheep?”\n\n“It is lost.”\n\n“How was it lost?”\n\n“Among the branching paths were yet more branches. We did not know which way to go, so we turned back.”\n\nMaster Yang’s countenance fell, and his expression changed. He did not speak for a long while, nor did he smile for the rest of the day. His disciples found this strange and asked, “The sheep is a lowly beast, and not even yours. Why does its loss affect your speech and laughter so?”\n\nMaster Yang did not answer, and his disciples did not understand his meaning.\n\nHis disciple Meng Sunyang went out and told Xin Duzi. Later, Xin Duzi and Meng Sunyang entered together and asked, “Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and learning the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked, ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’\n\nThe eldest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life and put reputation second.’\n\nThe second said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve reputation.’\n\nThe youngest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and reputation.’\n\nThese three methods are opposed, yet all derive from the Confucians. Which is right, and which is wrong?”\n\nMaster Yang replied, “There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, brave in swimming, he plied a boat to ferry passengers, earning enough to feed a hundred mouths. He packed provisions and took on students, who came in droves. Yet nearly half drowned. They came to learn swimming, not drowning, yet the profit and harm turned out thus.”\n\n“Which then is right, and which is wrong?” Mind-Do Master remained silent and departed.\n\nMeng Sunyang reproached him: “Why did you ask so circuitously, only for the Master to answer so obliquely? My confusion has only deepened.”\n\nMind-Do Master replied: “The great Way, by its many forks, loses the sheep; the scholar, by his many paths, forfeits his life. The learning is not different in root, nor is the root not one, yet the branches diverge thus. Only by returning to unity and reverting to the One can loss and gain, forfeiture and attainment be resolved. You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet fail to grasp the Master’s plight—how lamentable!\n\nYang Zhu’s younger brother, Bu, went out wearing plain white clothes. When rain fell, he removed the white and donned black before returning. His dog, not recognizing him, ran out barking. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it.\n\nYang Zhu said: “Do not strike it. You would do the same. Had your dog gone out white and returned black, how could you not find it strange?”\n\nYang Zhu said: “To act with goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame does not seek profit, yet profit accrues; profit does not invite strife, yet strife ensues. Thus the noble man must be cautious in doing good.\n\nOnce, a man claimed to know the Way to immortality. The Lord of Yan sent an emissary to learn it, but before success, the man died. The Lord of Yan was furious and was about to punish the emissary.\n\nA favored courtier advised: ‘Of all human concerns, none is more urgent than death; of all things one values, none surpasses life. He himself lost his life—how could he have secured your immortality?’ Thus the emissary was spared.\n\nA man of Qi also wished to learn the Way. Hearing that the teacher had died, he struck his chest in regret.\n\nFuzi, hearing of this, laughed: ‘He sought to learn immortality, yet when the man died, he still resented it—this is to misunderstand the very purpose of learning.’\n\nHuzi said: ‘Fuzi’s words are wrong. There are those who possess the method yet cannot practice it, and those who can practice it yet lack the method.’\n\nA man of Wei skilled in calculation, on his deathbed, imparted his secrets to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. When others asked, he recounted what his father had told him.”\n\nThe questioner applied his father’s words and practiced his method—there was no difference from his father. If this is so, why could the dead not transmit the art of living?\n\nThe people of Handan presented doves to Viscount Jian on New Year’s Day, and the viscount was greatly pleased, rewarding them generously. A guest asked the reason. Viscount Jian said: “On New Year’s Day, I release living creatures to show my benevolence.” The guest replied: “The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them—many die in the process. If you truly wish to preserve life, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them—your kindness cannot compensate for the harm.” Viscount Jian said: “You are right.”\n\nThe Tian clan of Qi held a sacrificial feast in their courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. Amid the gathering, someone presented fish and wild geese. Lord Tian gazed upon them and sighed: “How generous Heaven is to the people! It cultivates the five grains and gives life to fish and birds for their use.” The assembled guests echoed his words like an echo.\n\nThe son of the Bao family, twelve years old, was seated among them. He stepped forward and said: “It is not as you say. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, and we ourselves all arise together—we are of the same kind. Among kinds, there is no noble or base; they merely dominate one another by size, strength, or cunning, devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. People take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Are mosquitoes and gnats not made to bite flesh, or tigers and wolves to eat meat? Was it Heaven’s design to create humans for mosquitoes and tigers, or meat for wolves?”\n\nIn Qi there was a poor man who often begged in the marketplace. The people of the marketplace, weary of his frequent appeals, refused to give him anything.\n\nSo he went to the stables of the Tian family, where he worked as an assistant to the horse-doctor in exchange for food. Someone in the city mocked him: “Working for a horse-doctor for your meals—isn’t that shameful?” The beggar replied: “Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could working for a horse-doctor be?”\n\nA man from Song was traveling along a road when he found a discarded tally. He took it home and hid it, carefully counting its teeth. He told his neighbor: “My wealth is soon to come.” There was a man who had a withered parasol tree. His elderly neighbor said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man immediately cut it down. The neighbor then asked to take it as firewood, but the man grew displeased and said: “That old neighbor only wanted it for firewood, yet he urged me to cut it down. To live beside such a treacherous neighbor—how could I bear it?”\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe-thief; his expression—it was that of an axe-thief; his speech—it was that of an axe-thief; every movement and mannerism was unmistakably that of an axe-thief. Later, he dug in his grain pit and found his axe. When he saw his neighbor’s son again, none of his movements or mannerisms resembled an axe-thief.\n\nBai Gong Sheng was plotting rebellion. After court adjourned, he stood lost in thought, leaning on his scepter upside down. The metal tip pierced his chin, and blood flowed to the ground, yet he remained unaware. A man from Zheng heard of this and said: “If one can forget one’s own chin, what else might one forget?” When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over roots, collide with trees, and remain oblivious.\n\nOnce, a man from Qi coveted gold. Early one morning, he dressed in his finest and went to the market. Arriving at the gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and fled. The authorities caught him and asked: “With so many people around, why did you take someone else’s gold?” He replied: “When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.”\n\n*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue and Emptiness.",

      "translated_text": "Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers and grandees regarded him as one of the common folk. When the state’s resources grew insufficient, he prepared to depart for Wei. His disciples said: \"Master, once you go, there will be no set time for your return. If we, your disciples, have matters to present, what teachings will you leave us?\" Liezi replied: \"Have you not heard the words of Master Huqiu Zilin?\" Then he smiled and said: \"What did Master Hu say? Still, our teacher once spoke of this to Bohun Maoren. I overheard it in passing and will now tell it to you. He said: There is that which is born yet not born, and that which transforms yet does not transform. That which is not born can give birth to the born, and that which does not transform can bring about transformation. The born cannot but be born, and the transformed cannot but be transformed—thus there is constant birth and constant transformation. In constant birth and constant transformation, there is no time when there is not birth, no time when there is not transformation. This is but yin and yang, this is but the four seasons. That which is not born is solitary and unchanging, while that which does not transform moves to and fro. Their meeting point cannot be exhausted; the solitary and unchanging Way cannot be fathomed.\"\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gateway of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtle and seemingly present, its use is inexhaustible.\" Thus, that which gives life to things does not itself live, and that which transforms things does not itself transform. Things are self-born, self-transforming, self-formed, self-colored, self-knowing, self-powered, self-dissolving, and self-ceasing. To speak of them as born and transformed, formed and colored, knowing and powered, dissolving and ceasing—this is not so.\n\nLiezi said: \"Of old, the sages followed yin and yang to govern Heaven and Earth. If the formed are born from the formless, then from whence do Heaven and Earth arise?\" Thus it is said: There is the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Inception, and the Supreme Plainness. The Supreme Simplicity is the time before qi is seen; the Supreme Beginning is the beginning of qi; the Supreme Inception is the beginning of form; the Supreme Plainness is the beginning of substance. When qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated, this is called the Primal Chaos. \"Primal Chaos\" means that the myriad things are intermingled and not yet separated. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—thus it is called the Supreme Simplicity. The Supreme Simplicity has no form, yet it transforms into the One. The One transforms into the Seven, and the Seven transform into the Nine. The Nine is the limit of transformation, after which it returns to the One. The One is the beginning of the transformation of form. The clear and light rise to become Heaven, the turbid and heavy sink to become Earth, and the harmonious qi between them becomes Man. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born.\n\nLiezi said: \"Heaven and Earth have no complete achievements, the sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses. Thus, Heaven’s duty is to cover and give life, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things have their proper functions. Yet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations, and things have their penetrations. Why is this so? That which gives life and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot violate what is proper; and that which is proper is fixed and does not overstep its position. Thus, the Way of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the proper functions of the myriad things are either softness or hardness. All these follow what is proper and cannot overstep their positions.\n\nThus, there are the born, and there are those that give birth to the born; there are the formed, and there are those that give form to the formed; there are the sounding, and there are those that give sound to the sounding; there are the colored, and there are those that give color to the colored; there are the flavored, and there are those that give flavor to the flavored. The born that are born die, yet those that give birth to the born never end; the formed that are formed are solid, yet those that give form to the formed never exist; the sounding that are sounded are heard, yet those that give sound to the sounding never emit; the colored that are colored are manifest, yet those that give color to the colored never appear; the flavored that are flavored are tasted, yet those that give flavor to the flavored never present themselves. All these are the functions of non-action.\n\nThey can be yin or yang, soft or hard, short or long, round or square, alive or dead, hot or cold, floating or sinking, gong or shang, emerging or submerging, black or yellow, sweet or bitter, rank or fragrant. They have no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing they do not know, nothing they cannot do.\"\n\nLiezi traveled to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, overgrown with brambles, and pointed to it. Turning to his disciple Baifeng, he said: \"Only you and that skull know that we have never been born and never died. Has this been an excess of nurture? An excess of joy?\"",

Butterflies, in time, transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, called *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The froth of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixilu*. *Shixilu* gives rise to *shixihuangxu*, and *shixihuangxu* to *jiuyou*. *Jiuyou* gives rise to *maorui*, and *maorui* to *fuxuan*. A sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*, horse blood into *zhuanlin*, human blood into wildfire. The sparrowhawk becomes the kestrel, the kestrel the cuckoo, and the cuckoo in time reverts to the sparrowhawk. The swallow becomes a clam, the field mouse a quail, the *wuzhao* a fish, old leeks *xian*, old rams monkeys, and fish roe *gu*. The beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is called *lei*. The bird of rivers and marshes is born from a gaze and called *yi*. The creature named *dayao* is purely female, while *zhifeng* is purely male. A lovesick scholar, though unwed, may be moved to conception; a lovesick maiden, though husbandless, may conceive. Hou Ji was born from a giant’s footprint, Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry, Jue Zhao from dampness, and the wine midge from wine. When *yangxi* pairs with the unbudding bamboo, the long bamboo gives rise to *qingning*. *Qingning* gives rise to *cheng*, *cheng* to the horse, the horse to man, and man in time returns to the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism.\n\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Book* says: When form moves, it does not produce form but shadow; when sound moves, it does not produce sound but echo. Non-movement does not produce non-being but gives rise to being. Form must inevitably end. Do heaven and earth also end? They end with me. Do they advance beyond ending? I do not know. The Dao ends in what has no beginning, advances in what has no duration. Having life, one returns to non-life; having form, one returns to the formless. That which does not live is not originally non-living; that which is formless is not originally formless. Life is what must inevitably end. Ending is what cannot but end, just as life cannot but begin. To desire the perpetuation of life and the completion of its end is to be deluded by calculation.\n\nSpirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh to earth’s. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and congeals. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—hence it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means \"return,\" returning to its true dwelling. The Yellow Emperor said: When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me?\n\nFrom birth to death, the great transformations number four: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated and the will unified, harmony at its utmost—things do not harm it, and virtue cannot surpass it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise in full, things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften, the body prepares for rest, things no longer precede it; though it does not attain the wholeness of infancy, it surpasses youth and prime. In death, one returns to stillness, reverting to the ultimate.\n\nConfucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin robe tied with a rope, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked: \"Master, what is the source of your joy?\" He replied: \"My joys are many. Heaven generates the myriad things, and man is the most noble—this is my first joy. Among men and women, the male is honored and the female debased, so to be born a man is my second joy. Some do not live to see the sun and moon, never leaving swaddling clothes, but I have already reached ninety years—this is my third joy. Poverty is the scholar’s constant; death is man’s end. Abiding in constancy and meeting one’s end, what is there to grieve?\" Confucius said: \"Excellent! He knows how to console himself.\"\n\nLin Lei was nearly a hundred years old. In late spring, he donned a fur robe and gleaned fallen grain in an old field, singing as he walked. When Confucius passed through Wei and saw him in the wilds, he turned to his disciples and said: \"That old man may be worth speaking to. Go and question him.\" Zigong volunteered and met him at the edge of the ridge. Facing him, he sighed: \"Master, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning like this?\" Lin Lei walked on without pausing, his song unbroken. Zigong pressed him repeatedly, until at last he looked up and replied: \"What should I regret?\" Zigong said: \"In your youth, you did not strive; in your prime, you did not compete; in old age, you have no wife or children, and death approaches—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?\" Lin Lei laughed: \"The source of my joy is what all men possess, yet they turn it into sorrow. In youth, I did not strive; in my prime, I did not compete—thus I have lived so long. In old age, I have no wife or children, and death draws near—thus I can be so joyful.\" Zigong said: \"Longevity is man’s desire; death is man’s aversion. Why do you find joy in death?\" Lin Lei replied: \"Death and life are a going and a returning. Thus, one who dies here—how do we know he is not born there? So I know they are not the same, but how do I know that striving for life is not delusion? And how do I know that my death now is not better than my past life?\" Zigong, not grasping his meaning, returned and reported this to the Master. The Master said: \"I knew he was one with whom one could speak—indeed, so it is. Yet he has attained this understanding without fully exhausting it.\"",

They have no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing they do not know, nothing they cannot do.\"\n\nLiezi traveled to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers saw a century-old skull, overgrown with brambles, and pointed to it. Turning to his disciple Baifeng, he said: \"Only you and that skull know that we have never been born and never died. Has this been an excess of nurture? An excess of joy?\"",

      "translated_text": "Zigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: \"I wish to rest for a time.\"\nConfucius replied: \"In life, there is no rest.\"\nZigong asked: \"Then shall I, Ci, have no rest at all?\"\nConfucius said: \"You shall have rest—behold the grave-mound, so round, so smooth, so lofty, so firm. There you shall know your rest.\"\nZigong exclaimed: \"How great is death! The noble man finds rest therein; the petty man is laid low.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"Ci, you have grasped it. Men all know the joy of life, yet do not know its sorrows; they know the weariness of old age, yet do not know its ease; they know the aversion to death, yet do not know death as rest.\"\n\nYanzi said: \"How excellent that the ancients had death! The virtuous find rest therein; the unvirtuous are laid low. Death is the full realization of virtue. The ancients called the dead 'those who have returned.' If the dead are called 'those who have returned,' then the living are 'those who are journeying.' To journey without knowing to return is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the world loses its home, none know to condemn it. There are those who leave their native land, abandon their six relations, forsake their family estate, and wander the four quarters without returning—what manner of men are these? The world must call them mad and reckless. And there are those who prize worldly success, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves before the world without self-knowledge—what manner of men are these? The world must call them wise and cunning. Both have lost their way, yet the world approves one and not the other. Only the sage knows whom to approve and whom to reject.\"\n\nSomeone asked Master Liezi: \"Why do you value emptiness?\"\nLiezi replied: \"Emptiness is not to be valued.\"\nMaster Liezi said: \"It is not the name that matters—rather stillness, rather emptiness. In stillness and emptiness, one finds one’s proper place; in grasping and giving, one loses it. When affairs are shattered like stone and only then do men dance with benevolence and righteousness, it cannot be restored.\"\n\nZhou Xiong said: \"The turning ceaselessly revolves; heaven and earth shift imperceptibly—who perceives it? Thus, what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, completion and depletion, follow the world and follow death. Coming and going meet in succession, with no gap to spare—who perceives it? For qi does not advance all at once, nor does form deplete all at once; one does not perceive its completion, nor its depletion. It is like a man from youth to old age—his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and demeanor change day by day without pause. Skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing years, not remaining as they were in infancy. The change is imperceptible until later one knows. In the state of Qi, there was a man who fretted that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, so he forsook sleep and food. Another, worried for his worry, went to enlighten him, saying: 'Heaven is but an accumulation of qi—there is no place without qi. When you bend and stretch, breathe in and out, you move and rest all day within heaven. Why fear collapse?' The man said: 'If heaven is but an accumulation of qi, then the sun, moon, and stars should not fall?' The enlightener said: 'The sun, moon, and stars are also accumulations of qi, those with radiance within it. Even if they fell, they could do no harm.' The man said: 'What if the earth crumbles?' The enlightener said: 'The earth is but an accumulation of clods, filling the four voids—there is no place without clods. When you tread and step, you move and rest all day upon the earth. Why fear its crumbling?' The man was suddenly greatly relieved. The enlightener was also suddenly greatly relieved.\"\n\nMaster Changlu heard and laughed, saying: \"Rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, rain, and the four seasons—these are the accumulations of qi forming heaven. Mountains, rivers, metals, stones, water, and fire—these are the accumulations of form constituting earth. Knowing that qi accumulates, knowing that clods accumulate—how can one say they do not crumble? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest within what has bounds. They are difficult to exhaust, difficult to fathom—this is certainly so. They are difficult to measure, difficult to know—this is certainly so. To worry about their crumbling is indeed too distant; to say they do not crumble is also incorrect. Heaven and earth cannot but crumble, and when they do, they will return to crumbling. When their time of crumbling comes, how can one not worry?\"\n\nMaster Liezi heard and laughed, saying: \"To say heaven and earth crumble is also mistaken; to say they do not crumble is also mistaken. Whether they crumble or not, I cannot know. Nevertheless, that is one state, this is another. Thus, the living do not know the dead; the dead do not know the living. Coming does not know going; going does not know coming. Whether they crumble or not, how can I concern myself?\"\n\nShun asked Zheng: \"Can the Dao be possessed?\"\nZheng replied: \"Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?\"\nShun said: \"If my body is not my own, then whose is it?\"\nZheng said: \"It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not your own—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not your own—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not your own—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth.

      "translated_text": "The Guo family told them: \"I am skilled in the art of thievery. When I first began as a thief, I had enough after one year, abundance after two, and great prosperity after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire province and villages.\" The Xiang family rejoiced greatly, understanding his words about thievery but not the Dao of thievery. They then scaled walls and broke into houses, taking whatever their hands and eyes reached. Before long, they were caught for their crimes and lost all their ancestral wealth. Believing the Guo family had deceived them, the Xiang family went to complain. The Guo family asked: \"How did you go about thievery?\" The Xiang family described what they had done. The Guo family exclaimed: \"Alas! Have you lost the Dao of thievery to such an extent? Now I will tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, and earth has its advantages. I steal heaven and earth’s seasons and advantages—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the produce of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, I steal from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, trees, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven. How can they be mine? Thus, though I steal from heaven, I incur no misfortune. Gold, jade, precious treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what people amass—how can they be granted by heaven? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?\"\n\nThe Xiang family was deeply perplexed, thinking the Guo family was further deceiving them, and went to consult Master Dongguo. Master Dongguo said: \"Is not your very body a form of theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form—how much more so with external things? Truly, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To claim possession of them is delusion. The Guo family’s theft is the public Dao, so they incur no misfortune; your theft arises from private desire, so you are punished. Those with public and private motives are thieves; those without public and private motives are also thieves. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. Who can say what is theft and what is not?\"\n\n**Chapter Two: The Yellow Emperor**\n\nAfter fifteen years on the throne, the Yellow Emperor rejoiced that all under heaven supported him. He nurtured his natural destiny, indulged his ears and eyes, and gratified his nose and mouth. His complexion withered, his skin darkened, and his senses grew dull. Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that all under heaven remained untamed. He exhausted his wisdom and strength, governing the people, yet his complexion withered further, his skin darkened, his brows furrowed, and his senses grew dull.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor sighed deeply and said: \"My excesses have gone too far. Nurturing myself alone brings such affliction; governing the myriad things brings such affliction.\" Thereupon, he relinquished all affairs of state, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, silenced the bells, reduced his meals, and retired to dwell in the Hall of the Great Court. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, refraining from governance for three months.\n\nOne day, he fell into a daytime slumber and dreamed of wandering in the land of the Huaxu clan. The land of Huaxu lies west of Yan Province and north of Tai Province. It is unknown how many thousands of miles distant—beyond the reach of boats, carriages, or foot, accessible only in spirit. In that land, there are no rulers; all is spontaneous. The people have no desires; all is spontaneous. They do not delight in life nor fear death, so none die young. They do not favor themselves nor distance others, so there is no love or hate. They do not know opposition nor compliance, so there is no benefit or harm. They cherish nothing and fear nothing. They do not drown in water nor burn in fire. Cuts and blows cause no pain; pokes and scratches bring no itching. They tread the void as if on solid ground and sleep in emptiness as if on a bed. Clouds and mist do not obstruct their sight; thunder does not disturb their hearing. Beauty and ugliness do not confuse their hearts; mountains and valleys do not hinder their steps. They move as spirits.\n\nAwakening, the Yellow Emperor felt joyful and at ease. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji and said: \"During my three months of retreat, I purified my heart and disciplined my form, seeking the Dao to nurture the self and govern things, but I found no method. Exhausted, I slept and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through emotion.\"",

      "translated_text": "I have grasped it. I have attained it. Yet I cannot convey it to you.\n\nTwenty-eight years later, the realm reached great order, nearly resembling the land of Huaxu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence. The people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.\n\nMount Liegu on an island in the sea and river holds divine beings upon its summit. They drink the wind and sip the dew, partaking not of the five grains. Their hearts are like deep springs, their forms like maidens. They neither cling nor cherish, and immortals and sages serve as their ministers. They neither fear nor rage, and the honest and sincere act as their messengers. They neither bestow nor favor, yet all things are self-sufficient. They neither hoard nor gather, yet they themselves are without fault. Yin and yang remain ever harmonious, sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in constant order, wind and rain in perfect balance. Nurturing and breeding occur in due season, the harvest ever abundant. The land knows no blight, the people no premature death or misfortune. Things bear no blemish or pestilence, and ghosts emit no eerie sounds.\n\nLiezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Advancing in the Way of these two masters, he rode the wind and returned home. Yin Sheng heard of this and followed Liezi, dwelling with him for months without returning home. He then asked repeatedly to learn the art of guarding his person, but after ten requests, Liezi refused ten times. Yin Sheng, vexed, sought to take his leave, yet Liezi gave no command. Yin Sheng withdrew.\n\nMonths later, his desire unabated, he returned again. Liezi said: \"Why do you come and go so frequently?\" Yin Sheng replied: \"Formerly, I made requests of you, but you did not answer me, leaving me resentful. Now, my resentment has dissolved, so I have returned.\" Liezi said: \"Before, I took you for one who understood, but now your vulgarity has reached this point? Ji, I shall tell you what I learned from my master.\n\nSince I began serving my master and befriending such men, after three years, my heart dared not entertain thoughts of right and wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. I received but a single glance from my master. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm. Then my master first relaxed his countenance and smiled. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations without right or wrong, my words flowed without profit or harm. Then my master first drew me to sit beside him on the mat. After nine years, my heart roamed freely in thought, my words flowed without restraint. I no longer knew whether my right and wrong, profit and harm were mine or another’s. Nor did I know whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends. Within and without, all had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes became like ears, my ears like nose, my nose like mouth—all were the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, bones and flesh wholly fused. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a leaf or dry husk. Did the wind ride me, or did I ride the wind? Now you, dwelling at your master’s gate for barely a moment, have repeatedly harbored resentment. Your body’s fragments cannot bear the qi, your limbs cannot be borne by the earth. How can you hope to tread the void and ride the wind?\"\n\nYin Sheng was deeply ashamed. He held his breath for a long while and dared not speak again.\n\nLiezi asked Guan Yin: \"The perfected person walks through emptiness without obstruction, treads fire without heat, moves above the myriad things without fear. How does one attain this?\" Guan Yin replied: \"This is the preservation of pure qi, not the rank of cunning, skill, or boldness. Ji, let me tell you. All things with form, image, sound, or color are merely objects. How can objects be far apart from one another? Why should one strive to surpass them? They are but appearances. Thus, things are created from the formless and come to rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust its depths—how could they be corrected? They dwell in measureless depth, conceal themselves in traceless order, and roam the beginning and end of the myriad things. They unify their nature, nurture their qi, embrace their virtue, and merge with the source of things. Such as these preserve their Heavenly endowment whole, their spirit unobstructed. How could things enter them?\n\nWhen a drunkard falls from a cart, though swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs. His spirit is whole. He is unaware of riding or falling. Life and death, terror and fear do not enter his breast. Thus, he encounters things without alarm. If one preserved whole by wine can be thus, how much more one preserved whole by Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\"\n\nLie Yukou shot arrows for Bo Hun Wu Ren. He drew the bow to its fullest, placed a cup of water on his elbow, and released. The arrows followed one after another, each fitting precisely into the nock of the previous. At that moment, he was like a wooden figure. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: \"This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Let us ascend a high mountain, tread perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss. Can you shoot then?\" Thereupon, Wu Ren climbed the high mountain, trod the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the abyss. Turning his back, he retreated until two-thirds of his feet hung over the edge. Beckoning Lie Yukou forward, Lie Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat flowing to his heels. Bo Hun Wu Ren said: \"The perfected person gazes up to the azure sky, plunges down to the Yellow Springs, ranges to the eight directions—his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with the intent to fix your gaze. Your inner state is perilous indeed.\"\n\nThe Fan clan had a son named Zihua, skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state admired him. Favored by the Lord of Jin, he held no office yet ranked above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at, the state ennobled; whatever he spoke of, the state demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court’s retinue. Zihua employed his knights to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to overpower and humiliate each other. Though wounded and broken before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, and the state nearly became a custom.",

      "translated_text": "Hesheng and Zibo, the foremost retainers of the Fan clan, were traveling together when they passed beyond the city walls and lodged at the cottage of Tian Geng Shangqiu Kai. In the dead of night, the two men spoke of Zihua’s fame and influence—how he could make the living perish and the dead live again, turn the rich to poverty and the poor to wealth.\n\nShangqiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, had been eavesdropping from behind the north window. Seizing the chance, he borrowed provisions and a basket, then made his way to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s followers were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding grand carriages, strolling with leisurely strides and haughty gazes. When they caught sight of Shangqiu Kai—aged, frail, his face darkened by soot, his clothes and cap in disarray—not one did not sneer. The attendants grew harsh, and soon the mockery turned to insults and deceit, pushing and shoving, jostling and striking—nothing was left undone. Yet Shangqiu Kai never showed the slightest resentment, while the others, exhausted by their own antics, grew weary of their sport.\n\nThen they all ascended a high terrace, and amidst the crowd, someone idly remarked: *\"Whoever can leap down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.\"* The crowd clamored in response. Taking the words as truth, Shangqiu Kai leapt first, his body like a soaring bird, landing lightly on the ground—his bones unbroken, his flesh unharmed. The Fan clan’s faction dismissed it as mere chance and thought nothing of it.\n\nNext, they pointed to a secluded bend in the river and said: *\"There is a treasure pearl in those depths—dive, and you may retrieve it.\"* Shangqiu Kai dove in once more. When he emerged, he indeed held a pearl. The crowd began to murmur in doubt.\n\nZihua then ordered that Shangqiu Kai be given meat to eat and silk to wear. Soon after, a great fire broke out in the Fan clan’s treasury. Zihua declared: *\"Whoever can enter the flames and retrieve the brocade will be rewarded according to what they bring back.\"* Without hesitation, Shangqiu Kai went forward, entering and exiting the fire unscathed—no soot clung to him, his body was unburned. The Fan clan’s faction now believed him to possess the Dao, and together they apologized: *\"We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you. We did not know you were a spirit-man and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind. Pray, tell us of your Way.\"*\n\nShangqiu Kai replied: *\"I possess no Dao.

      "translated_text": "When you two guests lodged at my house before, I heard praise of the Fan clan’s power—how they could make the living perish and the dead live again, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed it without doubt, so I came without hesitation. Once here, I took your faction’s words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not whole enough, my actions not swift enough. I knew not where to place my body or where profit and harm lay. My heart was single, and all else vanished—it was as simple as that.\n\nNow I realize your faction deceived me. Within, I harbor suspicion; without, I strain to observe and listen. I recall with relief how I once emerged unscathed from fire and water, yet my heart burns with shame, and my body trembles in fear. How could I ever again approach water or fire?\n\nFrom then on, when the disciples of the Fan clan encountered beggars or horse-doctors on the road, they dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said: *\"Do you not understand? A person of perfect sincerity can move things, stir heaven and earth, touch ghosts and spirits, traverse the six directions without resistance—how could it be merely treading peril or entering fire and water? If Shangqiu Kai’s faith in falsehoods still met no resistance, how much more when both parties are sincere? Remember this, my disciples.*\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was a herdsman named Liang Yang, a lowly laborer who could tame wild birds and beasts. He scattered food in his garden and courtyard, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey grew docile. Males and females gathered before him, breeding and multiplying in groups. Different species lived together without attacking or biting one another.\n\nThe king, fearing the art would die with Liang Yang, ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it from him. Liang Yang said: *\"I am but a humble servant—why should I guard this knowledge to pass on to you? I fear the king will think I am hiding something from you. Let me tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi are by nature pleased when obeyed and angered when opposed. Yet their joy and rage are not reckless—they arise only when provoked. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will kill in anger; nor whole prey, for it will tear it apart in fury. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its temper, and thus the tiger—though a different species—will fawn upon its keeper. To obey it is to please it; to oppose it is to provoke its killing. So how could I dare oppose it to anger it? Yet I do not obey it to please it either. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger often shifts to joy—neither is balanced. If my heart holds neither opposition nor compliance, then the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus those that roam my garden do not long for distant forests or open marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or hidden valleys. This is the principle at work.\"*\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"I once crossed the abyss of Shangshen. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him: ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He said: ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught; skilled swimmers learn quickly. But as for divers—those who have never seen a boat yet instinctively master it.’ I asked him further, but he would not explain. May I ask what this means?\"*",

Those who can swim may be taught, for they are unburdened by water. Skilled swimmers master it swiftly, for they have forgotten water entirely.

When I stand, I am as still as a tree stump; when I hold my arm, it is as steady as a dry branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things are many, I am aware only of cicada wings. I do not turn or sway, nor do I let the myriad things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said: *\"When the mind is undivided, it verges on the divine.\"*\n\nThe hunchbacked elder said: *\"You, a scholar in robes, what do you know of such things? First refine your own method, then you may speak of it further.\"*\n\nThere was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Every morning, he went to the shore and followed the gulls, and hundreds of them would come to him without cease. His father said: *\"I hear the gulls all follow you—catch some for me to play with.\"* The next day, when he went to the sea, the gulls danced above but would not land. Thus it is said: *\"Perfect words leave no trace; perfect action requires no effort.\"* What the clever know is but shallow.\n\nWhen Viscount Xiang of Zhao led a hundred thousand men to hunt in Mount Zhong, they set fire to the forest, fanning flames a hundred *li* wide. A man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghost. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched. The viscount detained him in wonder and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were human; his breath and voice were human. He asked: *\"By what way do you dwell in stone? By what way do you enter fire?\"* The man replied: *\"What do you call stone? What do you call fire?\"* The viscount said: *\"What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.\"* The man said: *\"I do not know.\"*\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia: *\"What manner of man is he?\"* Zixia said: *\"From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one in perfect harmony with things cannot be harmed by them. Such a one may wander through metal and stone, tread water and fire—all is possible.\"* The marquis said: *\"Why do you not do this?\"* Zixia replied: *\"To hollow out the heart and discard knowledge—this I have not yet mastered. Still, I can speak of it when there is time.\"* The marquis said: *\"Why does the Master not do this?\"* Zixia said: *\"The Master is capable, yet he chooses not to act.\"* The marquis was greatly pleased.\n\nA divine diviner from Qi came to reside in Zheng, named Ji Xian. He could foretell life and death, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early demise—down to the year, month, ten-day period, or day—with godlike accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Master Hukou: *\"I once thought your Way was supreme, but now there is something even greater.\"* Hukou said: *\"I have shown you only its outward form, not its essence—how can you claim to have attained the Dao? With many females but no male, how can there be offspring? You take the Dao and oppose the world, yet you expect to be believed. That is why he could read your fortune. Try bringing him here to see me.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to meet Hukou. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He cannot last ten days. I saw something strange: he was like damp ashes.\"* Liezi went in, weeping so that his robe was soaked, and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the pattern of earth—stillness like a sprouting seed, neither trembling nor still. He likely saw my latent virtue, sealed and unmoving. Bring him again.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to see Hukou again. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Fortunate that your master met me—he is recovering. There are signs of life in the ashes. I saw his sealed power.\"* Liezi went in and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the expanse of heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet vitality arose from the soles of my feet. This is sealed power. He likely saw the sprouting of my good fortune. Bring him again.\"*\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought the diviner to see Hukou once more. When they emerged, the diviner said to Liezi: *\"Your master is unsettled—unable to fast. I cannot read him. Have him fast, and I will try again.\"* Liezi went in and told Hukou. Hukou said: *\"Just now, I showed him the great emptiness, devoid of signs. He likely saw my balanced *qi* at its subtlest. Where the whirlpool of the *ni* fish forms a deep pool, where still water forms a deep pool, where flowing water forms a deep pool, where overflowing water forms a deep pool, where soaking water forms a deep pool, where sinking water forms a deep pool, where dammed water forms a deep pool, where scattered water forms a deep pool, where rich water forms a deep pool—these are the nine deep pools.

      "translated_text": "It is not that you can make others shelter you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so—why then should you be moved by this? Being moved produces strange outcomes. And if one must be moved, it unsettles the root of one’s being—what meaning is there in that? Those who wander with you offer no counsel; their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how then can they be your equals?\n\nYang Zhu journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Cong traveled west to Qin, and they met by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, they encountered Laozi. Midway, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed: *\"At first I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.\"* Yang Zhu did not reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel and comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying: *\"Earlier, Master, you looked up to heaven and sighed, saying, ‘At first I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but there was no pause in your steps, so I dared not speak. Now that you have asked, may I inquire as to my fault?\"* Laozi said: *\"Your gaze is haughty and your bearing arrogant—who could bear to dwell with you? The purest white appears stained; the fullest virtue seems lacking.\"* Yang Zhu’s expression changed, and he said: *\"I humbly receive your instruction.\"*\n\nWhen he had first arrived, the innkeepers had welcomed him with deference, the master of the house holding the mat, his wife the towel and comb, the servants stepping aside from their seats, and the kitchen hands leaving the hearth. But upon his return, the innkeepers vied with him for space.\n\nYang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yang Zhu asked the reason. The innkeeper’s servant replied: *\"The beautiful one takes pride in her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful. The plain one is content in her plainness, so I do not see her as plain.\"* Yang Zhu said: *\"Take note, disciples. Act with virtue, but abandon the pride of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?\"*\n\nIn the world, there are ways that always prevail and ways that do not. The way that always prevails is called softness; the way that does not prevail is called strength. Both are known, yet men fail to understand them. Thus the ancients said: *\"Strength first defies those unlike oneself; softness first yields to oneself. He who first defies those unlike himself will, when he meets his equal, be imperiled. He who first yields to himself will never be imperiled. Use this to overcome a single person, and it is as if you had no opponent; use this to govern the world, and it is as if you bore no burden.\"* Master Zhou said: *\"To be firm, one must hold fast to softness; to be strong, one must preserve weakness. Accumulate softness, and you will become firm; accumulate weakness, and you will become strong. Observe what a man accumulates, and you will know whether fortune or misfortune lies ahead. Strength overcomes those weaker than oneself, but when it meets its equal, it breaks; softness overcomes by yielding to oneself—its power is immeasurable.\"*\n\nLao Dan said: *\"An army’s strength leads to its destruction; a tree’s strength leads to its breaking. The soft and weak belong to the living; the hard and strong belong to the dead.\"* Appearance need not be childlike for wisdom to be childlike, nor wisdom childlike for appearance to be so. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance; the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles mine are near and beloved; those whose appearance differs are distant and feared.\n\nA body seven feet tall, with hands and feet distinct, hair on the head and teeth in the mouth, standing and walking—this is called a human, yet it does not guarantee the absence of a beast’s heart. Though it may have a beast’s heart, its appearance still invites closeness. Creatures with wings and horns, fangs and claws, that fly aloft or crouch to run—these are called birds and beasts, yet they do not guarantee the absence of a human heart. Though they may have a human heart, their appearance still invites distance.\n\nFu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpent bodies, human faces, ox heads, and tiger noses—these were forms unlike man’s, yet they possessed the virtue of great sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Huan of Lu, and Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human features, identical to man’s form, yet they harbored the hearts of beasts. Thus, if the multitude cling to a single appearance in search of supreme wisdom, they will never come close.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor fought with the Flame Emperor at Banquan, he led bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as his vanguard, and eagles, falcons, hawks, and kites as his banners—this was commanding beasts by force. When Yao appointed Kui to oversee music, striking stone chimes and stone drums, the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* was played to its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was drawing beasts by sound. If the hearts of beasts differ from man’s, how so? Their forms and voices differ from man’s, yet men do not know how to bridge the gap. The sage is without ignorance, without obstruction, and thus can lead and employ them.\n\nThe wisdom of birds and beasts naturally aligns with man’s in some ways. In their desire to preserve life, they do not rely on human intelligence: male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid flatlands and seek high ground, shun cold and seek warmth; at rest, they form groups, and when moving, they travel in ranks; the young stay within, the strong guard the outside; when drinking, they lead one another, and when eating, they call to the flock. In the earliest times, they dwelled with man and walked alongside him. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in fear. By the final era, they hid and fled, evading harm.\n\nNow, in the land of Jieshi in the east, there are people who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is the result of partial knowledge. The divine sages of high antiquity fully understood the dispositions of all things and completely grasped the sounds of different species. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, treating them as equals to mankind. Thus, they first united with ghosts, spirits, and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally gathered birds, beasts, insects, and moths. This is because the hearts and minds of creatures with blood and qi are not so distant from one another. The divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.\n\nIn Song there was a man called the Monkey Master who loved monkeys. He kept a troop of them and understood their thoughts, just as they understood his.",

Fearing the monkeys would not submit to him, he first deceived them, saying: “I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four in the evening. Will that suffice?” The monkeys all rose in anger. Then he said: “I will give you chestnuts—four in the morning and three in the evening. Will that suffice?” The monkeys all prostrated themselves in delight. All things are ensnared by what they deem base—this is no different. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as the Monkey Master ensnared the monkeys with his cunning. The substance remained unchanged, yet he made them shift between joy and anger.\n\nJi Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: “Are the cocks ready to fight?” Ji replied: “Not yet. They are still vain and reliant on their qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Not yet. They still react to shadows and echoes.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked again. Ji said: “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, they remain unmoved. They appear like wooden cocks—their virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.”\n\nHui Ang visited King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, coughed loudly, and said rapidly: “What pleases me is courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you have for me?” Hui Ang replied: “I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, his blade will not pierce; though he may be strong, his blows will not strike. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “Excellent. This is what I desire to hear.” Hui Ang said: “That his blade does not pierce and his blows do not strike—this is still a form of humiliation. I possess a method by which, though a man may be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he may be strong, he will not dare to strike. That he does not dare is not because he lacks the will. I possess a method by which he fundamentally lacks the will. One who lacks the will has no mind for love or profit. I possess a method by which all men and women in the world joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four virtues. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “This is what I desire to attain.” Hui Ang replied: “Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Though they held no land as rulers nor office as ministers, all men and women in the world craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty is a ruler of ten thousand chariots. If you truly possess this will, then all within your four borders will receive its benefit—you will far surpass Confucius and Mozi.” The king had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out, and the king said to his attendants: “How persuasive!

      "translated_text": "In the time of King Mu of Zhou, a *huaren*—a being of transformations—arrived from the farthest western lands. He could enter water and fire unscathed, pass through metal and stone as if they were air; reverse the flow of mountains and rivers, relocate cities and towns; ride the void without falling, touch solid matter without obstruction. His thousand transformations and ten thousand changes knew no limit. Having altered the forms of things, he could also reshape the thoughts of men.\n\nKing Mu revered him as a deity and served him as a sovereign. He yielded his own bedchamber for the *huaren* to dwell in, offered the finest of the three sacrificial animals, and selected the most skilled musicians and dancers to entertain him. Yet the *huaren* found the king’s palace too humble to reside in, its kitchens’ fare too rank to consume, and its consorts too foul to embrace. Thus, King Mu ordered a new palace built, sparing no craftsmanship in its construction—its earthen walls and timber frames adorned with red ochre and white plaster until the five treasuries were emptied and the tower stood complete. Rising a thousand *ren* high, it overlooked the peaks of Mount Zhongnan and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven.\n\nThe king then gathered the fairest maidens from Zheng and Wei—lithe and graceful—anointing them with fragrant oils, painting their brows, adorning them with hairpins and earrings, dressing them in fine silks, trailing their hems in measured steps, powdering their faces white and darkening their eyes. He filled the halls with orchids and angelica, and had them perform *Chengyun*, *Liuying*, *Jiushao*, and *Chenlu* to delight the guest. Each month, jade-stitched robes were presented; each dawn, jade-like delicacies were offered. Yet the *huaren* remained unmoved, and only with reluctance did he ascend the terrace.\n\nBefore long, he invited the king to journey with him. Grasping the *huaren*’s sleeve, the king soared upward until they reached the midst of heaven, where they arrived at the *huaren*’s own palace. This palace was wrought of gold and silver, strung with pearls and jade, rising above the clouds and rain so that its foundations below were unseen—appearing as if a bank of piled clouds. All that met the eye and ear, all that entered the nose and mouth, was unlike anything in the human realm. The king truly believed he had come to the Celestial Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Grand Harmony of Heaven, the realm of the Supreme Emperor.\n\nLooking down, the king saw his own palaces and pavilions like so many clods of earth or heaps of straw. He lived there for what seemed decades, forgetting his kingdom entirely. The *huaren* then invited him on another journey. Wherever they went, neither sun nor moon shone above, nor rivers nor seas stretched below. The play of light dazzled his eyes until he could see nothing; the din of sound overwhelmed his ears until he could hear nothing. His limbs and organs trembled, unsteady; his mind wandered, his spirit scattered. He begged the *huaren* to return.\n\nThe *huaren* transported him back, and the king felt as though he had fallen from the void. When he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, his attendants unchanged. Before him, the wine remained unclarified, the meat still uncarved, the slices barely begun. When he asked how long he had been gone, his attendants replied, “Your Majesty merely sat in silent contemplation.”\n\nFor three months thereafter, King Mu remained lost in distraction. When he questioned the *huaren* again, the *huaren* said: “I journeyed with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference is there between the place we dwelled and your own palace? Between the realms we traversed and your own gardens? What you took for permanence was but a fleeting illusion; what you doubted was but a moment’s absence. At the extremes of transformation, in the space between swift and slow, can any model suffice?”\n\nThe king was overjoyed. He cared nothing for state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers or consorts, and gave himself wholly to distant wanderings. He commanded his eight steeds to be harnessed: on the right of the lead chariot, *Siyinhualiu* and *Lü’er*; on the left, *Chiji* and *Bai*; with *Zaofu* as driver and *Yi Qi* as right-hand guard. The second chariot bore *Quhuang* and *Yulun* on the right, *Daoli* and *Shanzi* on the left, with *Baiyao* as driver and *Benrong* as guard. They galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the *Jusou* people.\n\nThe *Jusou* offered the king the blood of white swans to drink, and the fresh milk of cows and horses to wash his feet and those of his two chariot attendants. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the foothills of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, the king ascended the heights of Kunlun to behold the palace of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then he was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted him upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, and he harmonized with her, though his verses touched upon but one theme.\n\nThereafter, he observed the place where the sun sets. In a single day, he traveled ten thousand *li*, and the king sighed: “Alas! Though I alone am not filled with virtue, I have found harmony in pleasure. Will later generations count this among my faults?” King Mu was nearly a transcendent being—able to exhaust the joys of an immortal’s life, though he lived but a hundred years. The world regarded him as having ascended to the realm of the gods.\n\nLao Chengzi studied the art of illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years without receiving any instruction. He asked to be told his faults and sought to withdraw, but Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into his chamber. Dismissing his attendants, he spoke: “When the ancestor of Lao Dan journeyed west, he turned to me and said: ‘The *qi* of living beings, the forms of material things—all are illusion. What the Creator begins, what yin and yang transform, we call life and death. To exhaust the reckonings and master change, to follow form and shift with it—this we call transformation, illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound, truly difficult to fathom or exhaust. But those who work through form display their art plainly, their work is shallow, and so they rise and vanish in an instant. Only when you know that illusion and transformation differ not from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I, too, are illusions—why study further?’”\n\nLao Chengzi returned home and pondered Master Yin Wen’s words for three months. Thereafter, he could make existence and extinction obey his will, summoning the seasons at whim. In winter, he brought forth thunder; in summer, he conjured ice. Birds ran, beasts flew. For the rest of his life, he never revealed his arts, and so the world never transmitted them.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “Those who excel in transformation keep their methods hidden and ordinary, their achievements indistinguishable from others’. The virtue of the Five Emperors, the accomplishments of the Three Kings—these were not all the result of wisdom or courage. Some were achieved through transformation. Who can fathom such things?”",

      "translated_text": "Awareness has eight signs, and dreams have six conditions.\n\nWhat are the eight signs? The first is the familiar, the second is action, the third is gain, the fourth is loss, the fifth is sorrow, the sixth is joy, the seventh is life, and the eighth is death. These eight signs are what the body encounters.\n\nWhat are the six conditions? The first is the ordinary dream, the second is the troubled dream, the third is the thought dream, the fourth is the waking dream, the fifth is the joyful dream, and the sixth is the fearful dream. These six arise from the interaction of the spirit.\n\nThose who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed when events arise, unsure of their cause. Those who do recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the cause when events arise. Knowing their cause, they are not distressed.\n\nThe ebb and flow, waxing and waning of the single body all correspond with Heaven and Earth and respond to the myriad things. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and being scorched. When both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly full, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking.\n\nThose whose illness is one of floating emptiness dream of soaring; those whose illness is one of sinking fullness dream of drowning. If one sleeps with a belt across the body, one dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying. When cold approaches, one dreams of fire; when illness approaches, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.\n\nMaster Liezi said: “When the spirit meets, it is a dream; when the body encounters, it is an event. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—these are encounters of spirit and form. Therefore, when the spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Trust waking but do not speak of it; trust dreams but do not act upon them—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things.”\n\nThe true person of old forgot themselves in waking and did not dream in sleep—how could this be empty words?\n\nIn the southwestern corner of the far west lies a land whose borders are unknown, called the Land of Ancient Wilderness.

      "translated_text": "The people of that land eat no food and wear no clothes, yet they sleep often, waking once every fifty days. To them, what they do in dreams is real, while what they perceive in waking is illusory.\n\nThe Central Kingdom spans the four seas, stretching north and south across the Yellow River and east and west beyond Mount Tai, covering over ten thousand li. There, the measured interplay of yin and yang brings alternating cold and heat; the clear division of dusk and dawn brings alternating day and night. Its people range from wise to foolish, and the myriad things flourish in abundance, their skills and arts manifold. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rites and laws in mutual support. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond reckoning. They regard what they do in waking as real and what they see in dreams as illusory.\n\nIn the northeastern corner lies a land called the Land of Fuoluo. Its earth is perpetually warm, and though bathed in the lingering light of the sun and moon, no fine crops grow there. The people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and unyielding; the strong oppress the weak, and they value victory over righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, ever awake and never sleeping.\n\nIn Zhou, the magnate Yin amassed great wealth, and his subordinates toiled ceaselessly from dawn to dusk. An old laborer, his strength spent, was yet pressed to work harder. By day, he groaned as he toiled; by night, he sank into deep slumber. His spirit scattered and waned, and night after night, he dreamed he was a ruler—presiding over the people, governing the state, roaming palaces and gardens, indulging every desire, his joy beyond compare. But waking, he returned to servitude. When others consoled him for his toil, he said: “A human life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is beyond compare. What cause have I for complaint?”\n\nYin, meanwhile, was consumed by worldly affairs and preoccupied with his family’s fortune. His mind and body were exhausted, and at night, he too sank into deep slumber. Night after night, he dreamed he was a servant—running errands, performing every task, enduring curses and beatings without end. In his sleep, he muttered and groaned, only falling silent at dawn. Troubled, Yin sought counsel from a friend. The friend said: “Your rank brings you honor, your wealth is more than enough—you surpass others by far. Yet you dream of being a servant, for hardship and ease must balance in time. How could you hope to have both waking and dreaming as you wish?”\n\nHearing his friend’s words, Yin eased the laborers’ burdens and reduced his own worries. His illness and distress soon abated.\n\nA man from Zheng was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He chased it down and struck it dead. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch and covered it with reeds, overjoyed beyond measure. But soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took it all for a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale. A passerby, hearing his words, followed them to retrieve the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife: “A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he left it. Now I have it—he was the one truly dreaming.” His wife said: “Is it not you who dreamed of the woodcutter finding the deer? Could there really have been a woodcutter? Now that you truly have the deer, is it not your dream that was real?” The man replied: “I have the deer in hand—why trouble myself over whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”\n\nThe woodcutter, dismayed at losing the deer, dreamed that very night of the place he had hidden it—and of the man who had taken it. At first light, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to the magistrate. The magistrate said: “At first, you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took your deer, and now you dispute it with him. My wife says that both of you dreamed of the deer, and no one truly has it. But since the deer is here, let us divide it in two.” He reported this to the lord of Zheng, who exclaimed: “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing someone’s deer?” He consulted his prime minister, who said: “Whether one dreams or not, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle this? For now, let us trust the magistrate’s judgment.”\n\nIn the Yangli district of Song, a man named Hua suffered from forgetfulness in middle age. What he took in the morning, he forgot by evening; what he gave at dusk, he forgot by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; at home, he forgot to sit. He no longer knew what came before or after. His household despaired. They consulted diviners, but the omens were unclear; they sought shamans to pray, but the prayers were ineffective; they called physicians to treat him, but the illness persisted.\n\nA Confucian scholar from Lu offered his services, claiming he could cure Hua. Hua’s wife and children offered half their estate in exchange for his remedy. The scholar said: “This is not a matter for divination, prayer, or medicine. Let me try to transform his mind and alter his thoughts—perhaps he may yet recover.” So he stripped Hua of his clothes, and Hua sought garments; he starved him, and Hua sought food; he confined him in darkness, and Hua sought light.",

Let me send away all attendants and stay alone with him for seven days.” They complied, unaware of what he did, but Hua’s long-standing affliction vanished in a single morning.\n\nOnce awakened, Hua flew into a rage. He cast out his wife, punished his children, and brandished a spear to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded an explanation. Hua said: “Before, I was lost in forgetfulness—adrift, unaware whether heaven and earth even existed. Now, suddenly recalling the past, the tangled threads of decades—life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate—all surge forth. I fear that the future’s entanglements of life and death, gain and loss, sorrow and joy, love and hate will disorder my mind like this. Could I ever regain even a moment’s forgetfulness?”\n\nZigong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius, who said: “This is beyond your understanding.” Then he turned to Yan Hui and told him to remember it.\n\nAmong the people of Qin, the Feng clan had a son who was clever in youth but developed a delusional disorder in adulthood. He mistook singing for weeping, white for black, fragrance for rot, sweetness for bitterness, and wrong for right. Whatever his mind turned to—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted. The Yang clan said to his father: “The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they cure him? Why not seek their help?”\n\nHis father traveled to Lu but passed through Chen, where he encountered Lao Dan. He described his son’s condition. Lao Dan said: “How do you know your son is deluded? Today, all under heaven are confused by right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those sharing his affliction are many, yet none awaken. A single person’s delusion cannot overturn a household; a household’s delusion cannot overturn a village; a village’s delusion cannot overturn a state; a state’s delusion cannot overturn the world. If all under heaven were deluded like your son, who would overturn whom? If everyone’s heart were like his, you would be the one deluded. Joy and sorrow, sounds and colors, scents and flavors, right and wrong—who can set them straight? Moreover, my words may themselves be delusion. How could the mediocre scholars of Lu untangle another’s confusion? Conserve your provisions and hasten home.”\n\nA man from Yan was born in Yan, raised in Chu, and in old age returned to his homeland.

Pointing to a mound, they said: “This is your ancestors’ grave.” The man could not restrain his sobs. His companions burst into laughter, saying: “We were only jesting with you—this is but the land of Jin.” The man was stunned.\n\nWhen he at last reached Yan and truly saw the city and village shrine of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ dwelling and grave, his sorrow diminished.\n\n---\n\n**Part Four**\n\nConfucius was at leisure in his chamber when Zigong entered to attend him, his countenance troubled. Zigong dared not ask, but upon leaving, he told Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and sang. Hearing this, Confucius summoned Yan Hui back and asked: “Why do you alone find joy?”\n\nYan Hui replied: “Why does the Master alone bear sorrow?”\n\nConfucius said: “First speak your own mind.”\n\nYan Hui said: “I once heard the Master say: ‘He who delights in the Dao and knows fate is therefore without sorrow’—this is why I find joy.”\n\nConfucius, his expression darkening, asked: “Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood. That was my teaching of former days; let my words of today be taken as correct. You know only that delighting in the Dao and knowing fate brings freedom from sorrow, but you do not know that delighting in the Dao and knowing fate entails a sorrow greater still.\n\nNow I will tell you the truth: to cultivate the self, to accept poverty or prosperity, to know that past and future are not one’s own, to banish disturbance from the heart—this is what you call delighting in the Dao and knowing fate without sorrow. Formerly, I studied the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, rectified rites and music, intending to govern all under heaven and leave a legacy for future generations—not merely to cultivate the self or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily lose their proper order; benevolence and righteousness grow ever weaker, human nature ever more shallow. If the Dao cannot prevail in a single state or a single generation, how can it prevail in all under heaven or for ages to come? I first realized that the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music could not save the world from disorder, yet I did not know the means to reform it—this is the sorrow of one who delights in the Dao and knows fate.\n\nThough even so, I have grasped it now. The joy and knowledge of which I speak are not what the ancients called joy and knowledge. Without joy, without knowledge—this is true joy, true knowledge. Thus there is nothing not joyful, nothing not known, nothing not sorrowful, nothing not done. Why then abandon the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, rites, and music? Why seek to reform them?”\n\nYan Hui bowed northward and said: “I too have grasped it.” He went out and told Zigong. Zigong stood bewildered, lost in thought. Returning home, he brooded for seven days without sleep or food, until his frame was reduced to bone. Yan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’ gate, playing the zither and chanting the classics all day without cease.\n\n---\n\nA minister of Chen, on a mission to Lu, sought a private audience with the house of Shusun. Shusun said: “In our state there is a sage.”\n\nThe minister asked: “Is it not Kong Qiu?”\n\nShusun replied: “It is. How did you know he is a sage?”\n\nShusun said: “I once heard Yan Hui say: ‘Kong Qiu can still the mind and employ the body.’”\n\nThe minister of Chen said: “In our state, too, there is a sage—did you not know? Who is this sage?”\n\nShusun asked: “Of whom do you speak?”\n\nThe minister said: “Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cangzi who has attained Lao Dan’s Dao. He can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu, hearing this, was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with rich gifts to invite him. Kang Cangzi accepted the summons and came. The Lord of Lu, speaking humbly, sought his instruction.\n\nKang Cangzi said: “The reports of me are false. I can see and hear without using ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse their functions.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu said: “This is even more extraordinary! What is the nature of your Dao? I earnestly wish to hear it.”\n\nKang Cangzi said: “My body aligns with my mind, my mind with my qi, my qi with my spirit, my spirit with the formless. If there is the slightest presence of something, the faintest sound, whether far away at the ends of the earth or near at hand between my brows, whatever comes to disturb me, I will surely know it. Yet I do not know whether this awareness comes from my seven orifices and four limbs, or from the knowledge of my heart and six viscera—it simply knows itself.”\n\nThe Lord of Lu was overjoyed. Later, he told Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.\n\n---\n\nThe Grand Steward of Shang visited Confucius and asked: “Is Qiu a sage?”\n\nConfucius said: “How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Yet Qiu is one of broad learning and many attainments.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Three Kings sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Five Emperors sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward asked: “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?”\n\nConfucius said: “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in adapting to the times—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”\n\nThe Grand Steward, greatly startled, said: “Then who is a sage?”\n\nConfucius, his expression shifting after a pause, said: “Among the people of the West, there is one who may be a sage. He does not govern, yet there is no disorder; he does not speak, yet is trusted; he does not transform, yet things follow their course. So vast is he that the people cannot name him. I suspect he may be a sage, but I do not know whether he truly is a sage—or truly is not.”\n\nThe Grand Steward fell silent, pondering to himself: “Kong Qiu deceives me!”\n\n---\n\nZixia asked Confucius: “What sort of man is Yan Hui?”\n\nConfucius said: “Hui’s benevolence surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zigong?”\n\nConfucius said: “Ci’s eloquence surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zilu?”\n\nConfucius said: “You’s courage surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia asked: “What sort of man is Zizhang?”\n\nConfucius said: “Shi’s dignity surpasses my own.”\n\nZixia rose from his mat and asked: “Then why do these four serve you?”\n\nConfucius said: “Sit.

Nine years later, whether his heart wandered or his mouth spoke freely, he knew not whether these were his own right and wrong, profit and harm, or another’s. Inner and outer had advanced as one. Thereafter, his eyes were as ears, his ears as nose, his nose as mouth—all were indistinguishable. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, flesh and bone fused entirely. He no longer sensed what his body leaned against, where his feet trod, what his heart conceived, or what his words concealed. It was simply thus. Then no principle remained hidden.\n\nEarlier, Liezi delighted in wandering. Master Huqiu asked: “Yu Kou delights in wandering—what does he delight in when he wanders?” Liezi replied: “The joy of wandering lies in savoring what has no fixed nature. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering, wandering—none can distinguish this wandering.” Master Huqiu said: “Is Yu Kou’s wandering truly the same as others’, or is it truly different? All that is seen is ever seen in its transformations. To delight in the unfixed nature of things yet not know that I, too, am unfixed—to seek wandering outwardly yet not know to seek inner contemplation—this is the way. The outward wanderer seeks completion in things; the inward observer finds sufficiency in the self. Finding sufficiency in the self is the perfection of wandering; seeking completion in things is its imperfection.” Thereupon, Liezi never left his home again, believing himself ignorant of wandering. Master Huqiu said: “Is this not the perfection of wandering? The perfect wanderer knows not where he goes; the perfect observer knows not what he beholds. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, what I call observation. Thus it is said: Is this not the perfection of wandering? Is this not the perfection of wandering?”\n\nLong Shu said to Wen Zhi: “Your art is subtle. I suffer from an affliction—can you cure it?” Wen Zhi replied: “I await your command. But first, tell me the symptoms of your ailment.” Long Shu said: “Praise from my village brings me no honor, slander from my state brings me no shame. Gain does not gladden me, loss does not grieve me. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as no different from them. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; viewing my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. All these manifold afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor decline, profit nor harm can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me. Thus, I cannot serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this affliction? What method can cure it?”",
      "overlap_context": " all wore expressions of doubt.\n\nLiezi said: “Those who have attained the Dao speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use silence as speech is still speech; to use ignorance as knowledge is still knowledge. Silence and not speaking, ignorance and not knowing—these are also speech and knowledge. They are without anything not spoken, without anything not known; yet also without anything spoken, without anything known. It is simply thus. Why are you so groundlessly astonished?”",

      "translated_text": "Then Wen Zhi bade Long Shu stand with his back to the light. Wen Zhi himself stood behind him, facing the light, and gazed at him. After a while, he said: “Ah! Now I see your heart. The square inch of ground within is empty—you are nearly a sage. Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, with only one still blocked. Is it not perhaps from this that those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction arise? This is not something my shallow art can cure.\n\nThat which arises without cause and yet is ever-generating is the Dao. That which is generated by generation, though it may end, does not perish—this is constancy. That which is generated yet perishes is misfortune. That which arises with cause and yet is ever-dying is also the Dao. That which dies by death, though it may not yet have come to pass, perishes of itself—this too is constancy. That which dies yet lives is fortune.\n\nThus, to live without use is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain an end is called constancy. To die with use is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy. When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang. When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept. The birth of a bondsman, the death of a bondsman—common folk sing, common folk weep.\n\nOne whose eyes are about to dim first sees the autumn down; one whose ears are about to deafen first hears the gnat in flight; one whose palate is about to fail first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Meng; one whose nose is about to block first detects the scent of charred rot; one whose body is about to stiffen first hastens to flee; one whose heart is about to be deluded first discerns right and wrong. Thus, when a thing does not reach its end, it does not return.\n\nIn Zheng, the marshlands of Puze abounded in worthies, and Dongli teemed with talent. During the campaign at Puze, there was a man named Bo Fengzi who, passing through Dongli, encountered Deng Xi. Deng Xi turned to his disciples and laughed, saying: “Let us perform a dance for him. What think you of that one approaching?” His disciples replied: “We would gladly know.” Deng Xi said to Bo Fengzi: “Do you understand the meaning of nourishing and being nourished? To receive nourishment from others yet be unable to nourish oneself is the way of dogs and swine. To nourish things and have them serve one’s use is the power of man. If your followers eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest, it is the achievement of governance. Yet when the old and young gather in droves to become fodder for the pens and kitchens, how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?”\n\nBo Fengzi did not respond. One of his followers stepped out of turn and advanced, saying: “Has the Master not heard of the many devices in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in working earth and wood, those skilled in working metal and leather, those skilled in music, those skilled in writing and calculation, those skilled in military affairs, and those skilled in ancestral rites—all talents are assembled. Yet without one to order their positions, without one to command their abilities, and when the one who orders lacks knowledge, the one who commands lacks ability, then knowledge and ability are made to serve. The one who governs is but one whom we make to serve. Why then do you boast, Deng Xi?” Deng Xi could make no reply; he glared at his disciples and withdrew.\n\nGongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and sent an envoy to summon him. When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his form, he saw only a feeble man. Perplexed, King Xuan asked: “What is the measure of your strength?” Gongyi Bo replied: “Your servant’s strength can snap the leg of a spring louse and bear the wing of an autumn cicada.” The king’s expression darkened as he said: “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or a young buffalo and drag the tails of nine oxen, yet I still regret my weakness. You can snap the leg of a spring louse and bear the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—how can this be?” Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: “Excellent is Your Majesty’s question.

      "translated_text": "My master, a man of Shangqiu named Zi, possessed strength unmatched in the world, yet his kin never knew it, for he never once employed his strength. I served him unto death. He once instructed me: “One who wishes to see what others cannot must train his eyes where others do not look; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot must cultivate what others do not practice. Thus, those who learn to see first perceive a cartload of firewood, and those who learn to hear first catch the tolling of a bell. For one whose inner power is effortless, no outer task is difficult. When no outer task is difficult, his name does not leave even a single household.”\n\nNow my name is known among the feudal lords—this means I have violated my master’s teaching and made my ability conspicuous. Yet my renown does not come from squandering my strength, but from knowing how to use it. Is this not better than squandering it?\n\nThe Lord Mou of Zhongshan, a worthy prince of Wei, delighted in the company of worthy men. He neglected state affairs and took pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long, a man of Zhao. The disciples of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Lord Mou asked: “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?”\n\nZiyu replied: “Gongsun Long’s character is such that he follows no master, studies with no companions, flatters glibly without substance, rambles aimlessly without a school, and delights in the strange while uttering absurdities. He seeks to bewilder men’s minds and silence their speech, practicing sophistry alongside men like Han Tan.”\n\nLord Mou’s expression changed as he said: “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults so? Pray tell me the truth.”\n\nZiyu said: “I laugh at how Long deceived Kong Chuan, saying that a skilled archer could make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, each shot following the last, each shaft linked to the next, so that the first arrow reaches the target without a single miss, and the nock of the last arrow still rests on the bowstring—appearing as one. Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: ‘This is not yet the marvel.’ A disciple of Yuan Meng named Hong Chao, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and loosed a Qiwei arrow at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelid did not blink; the arrow fell to the ground, and not a speck of dust was stirred. Can this truly be the words of a wise man?”\n\nLord Mou said: “The words of the wise are not understood by fools. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock hooks the later to the earlier. The arrow flying toward the pupil without the eyelid blinking exhausts the arrow’s momentum. Why do you doubt this?”\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: “You are a follower of Long—how could you not gloss over his flaws? I shall tell you of his greater absurdities. Long deceived the King of Wei, saying: ‘There is intention without mind. There is pointing without reaching. There is substance without exhaustion. There is shadow without movement. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf never had a mother.’ His violations of categories and inversions of logic are too numerous to recount.”\n\nLord Mou said: “You take profound words as absurdities—your error is greater still. Without intention, minds are the same; without pointing, all things are reached. To exhaust a thing is to possess it always. That a shadow does not move lies in its transformation. A single hair drawing a thousand jun arises from equal force. That a white horse is not a horse comes from the separation of form and name. That an orphaned calf never had a mother means it is not an orphaned calf.”\n\nLe Zhengzi Yu said: “You take all of Gongsun Long’s prattling as reasoned argument. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would still endorse them.”\n\nLord Mou fell silent for a long while, then withdrew, saying: “Let me wait for another day to call upon you and discuss this further.”\n\nWhen Yao ruled the world for fifty years, he did not know whether the world was well governed or not, nor whether the countless people wished to support him or not.

      "translated_text": "Gé said: East of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great abyss, a bottomless valley indeed, called the Returning Gully. The waters of the Eight Directions and Nine Wilds, the currents of the Celestial River—none fail to pour into it, yet it neither swells nor diminishes.\n\nWithin it stand five mountains: the first is called Dàiyú, the second Yuánqiáo, the third Fānghú, the fourth Yíngzhōu, and the fifth Pénglái. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, its flat summit spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their midpoints is seventy thousand *li*, yet they are neighbors. Their terraces and towers are all of gold and jade, their birds and beasts all pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all rich in flavor; those who eat them never age nor die. The inhabitants are all of the seed of immortals and sages, and those who fly back and forth between them in a single day or night are beyond counting.\n\nYet the roots of the five mountains had no fixed mooring, drifting ceaselessly with the tides, unable to stand firm for even a moment. The immortals and sages, distressed, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the westernmost reaches and the dwellings of the assembled sages be lost, he commanded Yújiāng to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to lift their heads and bear the mountains aloft. They took turns in three shifts, rotating every sixty thousand years. Thus the five mountains stood firm and unmoving.\n\nNow, in the land of Lóngbó there lived giants whose strides spanned the five mountains in fewer than a dozen steps. One of them cast a line and hooked six of the turtles at once, then carried them back to his country, where he scorched their bones to divine by their cracks. Thereupon the two mountains Dàiyú and Yuánqiáo drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, and the immortals and sages who were displaced numbered in the countless millions. The Emperor, enraged, diminished the land of Lóngbó to straiten it and shrank its people to shorten them. By the time of Fúxī and Shénnóng, its inhabitants still measured several thousand *zhàng* in height.\n\nFrom the Central States eastward four hundred thousand *li* lies the land of Jiāoyáo, where people stand a foot and a half tall. In the far northeast there are beings called the Tranquil Folk, nine inches in height. South of the Jing region dwell the Dark Numinous Ones, for whom five hundred years make a spring and five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity there was the Great Chūn Tree, for whom eight thousand years make a spring and eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow fungi and mushrooms that sprout at dawn and wither by dusk. In the months of spring and summer there are midges and gnats that come to life with the rain and die at the sight of the sun.\n\nNorth of the northernmost reaches lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake, wherein dwells a fish several thousand *li* in breadth, its length commensurate, called the Kūn. There is also a bird called the Péng, its wings like clouds trailing from the sky, its body in proportion. Does the world know of such creatures? Great Yǔ beheld them in his travels, Bóyì named them in his knowledge, and Yíjiān recorded them in his annals.\n\nBetween the riverbanks there breed tiny insects called the Jiāomíng, which swarm and alight upon the lashes of mosquitoes without touching them. They come and go, roost and depart, yet the mosquito remains unaware. Lízhū and Zǐyǔ, in broad daylight, rubbed their eyes and raised their brows to peer, yet could not make out their form. Jiǎohǔ, Chǒuzhì, Wényú, Pǔmǐ, Sānqièyú, and Shī Kuàng, in the dead of night, cupped their ears and bent their heads to listen, yet could not catch their sound. Only the Yellow Emperor and Róngchéngzǐ, dwelling upon Kōngtóng, fasted together for three months, their hearts stilled and bodies forgotten. Then, with their spirit, they gazed slowly and saw them as clearly as the slopes of Mount Sōng; with their *qi*, they listened slowly and heard them as loudly as thunder.",

      "translated_text": "The River Bend sage laughed and tried to stop him, saying: “How foolish you are! With your waning years and remaining strength, you cannot even strip a single blade of grass from the mountain—what then can you do with earth and stone?”\n\nNorth Mountain Foolish Old Man sighed deeply and replied: “Your heart is so rigid it cannot be pierced—you are not even the equal of a widow or a weak child. Though I die, I have sons who survive. Sons beget grandsons, grandsons beget sons, sons again beget sons, sons again beget grandsons—sons and grandsons without end. Yet the mountains do not grow larger. Why then should they not be leveled?”\n\nThe River Bend sage had no answer. The spirit who wields the serpent heard of this and, fearing he would never cease, reported it to the Emperor. Moved by his sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Kuafu to bear the two mountains—one placed east of Shuò, the other south of Yōng. From that time on, south of Jì and north of the Hàn, there were no more ridges to block the way.\n\nKuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow and pursued it to the edge of Yú Valley. Thirsting for drink, he rushed to the Yellow River and the Wèi. When the Yellow River and the Wèi proved insufficient, he set off north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he arrived, he died of thirst along the way. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the ground, the Dèng Forest grew. The Dèng Forest spread wide for thousands of *li*.\n\nGreat Yǔ said: “Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, marked by the four seasons, and bound by the Great Year. The beings born of spirits and gods, their forms and natures—whether short-lived or long—only the sage can fathom their Dao.”\n\nXià Gé replied: “Yet there are those who arise without relying on spirits, take form without depending on yin and yang, shine without needing sun and moon, die young without violence, live long without care, eat without grain, clothe themselves without silk or floss, travel without boats or chariots. Their Dao is natural—beyond even the sage’s comprehension.”\n\nWhen Yǔ governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed into a foreign realm. By the northern shore of the Northern Sea, beyond countless thousands of *li* from Qí Province, lay a land called Zhōngběi, its borders and limits unknown. No wind or rain, frost or dew fell there, nor did birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grow. All was level, encircled by towering ridges. At the land’s center stood a mountain named Húlǐng, shaped like an overturned jar. At its summit was an opening, round like a ring, called the Nourishing Cavern. Water gushed forth, named the Divine Spring, its fragrance surpassing orchid and pepper, its taste finer than fine wine. From this single source, four channels flowed down the mountain, irrigating the entire land without exception. The earth’s qi was harmonious, and no plagues or epidemics arose.\n\nThe people were gentle and compliant, neither competitive nor contentious, soft-hearted and weak-boned, neither arrogant nor envious. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects; men and women mingled freely without matchmakers or betrothals. They lived along the water, neither plowing nor sowing. The earth’s qi was warm and agreeable, so they neither wove nor wore clothes. They lived a hundred years without dying young or falling ill. Their population flourished without count, ever joyful, never aging or sorrowful.\n\nTheir custom was to love music. They linked hands and sang in turns, their voices never ceasing all day. When hungry or weary, they drank from the Divine Spring, their strength and spirits harmonious. If they overindulged, they became drunk, waking only after ten days. Bathing in the Divine Spring, their skin grew sleek and glossy, their fragrance lingering for ten days.\n\nKing Mù of Zhōu traveled north and passed through their land, remaining three years before remembering to return. Once back in his court, he longed for that country, lost in melancholy. He refused wine and meat, summoned no concubines, and only after several months did he recover.\n\nGuǎn Zhòng urged Duke Huán of Qí to journey to Liáokǒu, intending to reach that land together. They nearly succeeded, but Xí Péng admonished: “Why abandon Qí’s vast lands, its teeming people, its scenic mountains and rivers, its fertile resources, its flourishing rites and justice, its splendid robes and ornaments? Your halls overflow with beauty, your court with loyal ministers. With a shout, a million soldiers answer; with a gesture, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and forsake Qí’s altars of soil and grain to follow barbarians?”\n\nDuke Huán desisted, relaying Xí Péng’s words to Guǎn Zhòng. Guǎn Zhòng replied: “This is beyond Péng’s understanding. I fear that land cannot be known.” Why cling to Qí’s wealth? Why heed Xí Péng’s words?\n\nAmong the southern peoples, some shave their heads and go bare; in the north, they wear fur hats and robes; in the Central States, they don crowns and skirts. Across the Nine Provinces, some farm, some trade, some hunt, some fish—like winter furs and summer linen, boats for water and carts for land, all obtained naturally, shaped by nature.\n\nEast of Yuè lies the nation of Zhéxiū, where the eldest son is butchered and eaten at birth, called “favoring the younger brother.” When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying: “A ghost-wife cannot dwell with the living.”\n\nSouth of Chǔ lies the land of the Yán people. When kin die, they rot the flesh with maggots, share it among themselves, then discard it before burying the bones—only then are they deemed filial.\n\nWest of Qín lies the nation of Yíqú Wénkāng. When kin die, they pile firewood and burn the body. The rising smoke is called “ascending to the distant,” and only then are they deemed filial. Such practices, whether imposed by rulers or adopted as custom, are hardly strange.\n\nConfucius traveled east and saw two children arguing. When he asked the reason, one child said: “I believe the sun is nearer at dawn and farther at noon.”\n\nThe other child said: “I believe the sun is farther at dawn and nearer at noon.”\n\nThe first child said: “At dawn, the sun is as large as a carriage canopy, but by noon, it is only the size of a plate or bowl.

When I stand by the river with my rod, my mind is free of distractions, fixed only on the fish. I cast my line and lower my hook with a hand that knows no lightness or heaviness, so nothing can disturb me. To the fish, my hook and bait seem no more than sinking dust or floating foam—they swallow it without hesitation.

Qi Ying’s will is weak but his qi is strong, so he lacks foresight yet acts with reckless force. If I were to exchange your hearts, you would both attain balance in goodness.\"\n\nThereupon, Bian Que gave the two men a poisoned wine to drink, rendering them unconscious for three days. He then opened their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and restored them with a divine medicine. When they awoke, they were as before.\n\nThe two men took their leave and returned home. Gong Yu, however, went to Qi Ying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qi Ying went to Gong Yu’s house and took possession of his wife and children, yet they too did not recognize him. The two households then brought their dispute before Bian Que to adjudicate. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was resolved.\n\nWhen Hu Ba played the zither, birds danced and fish leapt. Zheng Shiwen, hearing of this, abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the notes, yet he could not form a single melody. Master Xiang said: \"You may return home now.\"\n\nShiwen set down his zither and sighed: \"It is not that my fingers cannot hook the strings, nor that I cannot form a melody. What I seek does not lie in the strings, nor does my aspiration rest in sound. If within I am not settled in my heart, and without I do not harmonize with qi, I dare not lift my hand to move the strings.

When autumn came, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm breeze gently swirled, making grasses and trees flourish. In summer, he plucked the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow fell together, while rivers and ponds froze solid. When winter arrived, he struck the *zhi* string to excite *Rui Bin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting hard ice in an instant.\n\nAs the piece neared its end, he commanded the *gong* string to unite the four, and at once a balmy breeze soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew descended, and fragrant springs welled forth.

Qin Qing did not stop him. At the crossroads outside the city, he gave a farewell feast, beating time and singing a mournful song. His voice shook the trees, and its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then begged forgiveness and asked to return, swearing never to speak of leaving again. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said:\n\n\"Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, but her provisions ran out. Passing through Yongmen, she sold her songs to beg for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without fading, and those nearby felt as though she had not departed. When she stayed at an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then let forth a drawn-out, sorrowful cry, and the elders and children of the village grieved together, weeping face to face for three days without eating. They hastily pursued her. When Han E returned, she sang a long, melodious song, and the villagers leapt and danced for joy, unable to contain themselves, forgetting their former sorrow. Thus they richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. To this day, the people of Yongmen excel in singing and weeping, imitating Han E’s lingering tones.\"\n\nBoyi was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Boyi played with his mind set on climbing a high mountain, Zhong Ziqi said: \"How fine! Lofty as Mount Tai!\" When his intent turned to flowing water, Zhong Ziqi said: \"How fine! Vast as the Yangtze and Yellow River!\" Whatever Boyi conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped it.\n\nOnce, Boyi was traveling along the northern slope of Mount Tai when he was suddenly caught in a violent storm. Taking shelter beneath a cliff, his heart filled with sorrow, and he took up his zither to play. First he composed a piece for ceaseless rain, then shifted to the sound of crumbling mountains. With each melody, Zhong Ziqi exhausted its meaning. Boyi then set down his zither and sighed: \"How excellent, how excellent is your listening! Your thoughts and imaginings are as my own heart. Where could I hide my music from you?\"\n\nKing Mu of Zhou went on a western expedition, crossing the Kunlun Mountains but not reaching Yan Mountain.

      "translated_text": "The king believed it to be a real person and, together with Lady Sheng and his inner attendants, observed its performance. As the act neared its end, the performer winked its eye and beckoned to the king’s concubines on either side. Enraged, the king immediately ordered Yanshi’s execution. Trembling in fear, Yanshi at once dismantled the performer before the king, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, white, black, red, and blue pigments. The king examined it closely: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, skin, hair, teeth, and hair—all artificial, yet none missing. When reassembled, it appeared as before. The king then tested it: removing its heart, its mouth could not speak; removing its liver, its eyes could not see; removing its kidneys, its feet could not walk. Only then did King Mu smile in wonder and exclaim, \"Can human skill truly rival the work of creation?\" He ordered a secondary chariot to carry it back.\n\nAs for Lu Ban’s cloud ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite, they had deemed their craftsmanship unsurpassable. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yanshi’s artistry, they reported it to their masters. From that day forth, the two never dared speak of their skills again, but instead constantly wielded compass and square.\n\nGan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and cause beasts to crouch and birds to descend. His disciple Fei Wei, who studied under Gan Ying, surpassed his teacher in skill. Another disciple, Ji Chang, in turn learned archery from Fei Wei. Fei Wei instructed him, \"First master the art of not blinking, then we may speak of archery.\" Ji Chang returned home and lay beneath his wife’s loom, fixing his gaze upon the suspended treadle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip brushed his eyelashes, he did not blink. He reported this to Fei Wei, who said, \"Not yet. You must next learn to see—see the small as large, the faint as distinct—then come tell me.\" Ji Chang hung a louse from the window with a yak hair and faced south to observe it. Within ten days, it seemed to grow larger; after three years, it appeared as big as a cartwheel. All else he beheld seemed like mountains and hills. He then took a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reed, shot the louse, and pierced its heart without breaking the hair. He told Fei Wei, who leapt up, clapped his chest, and cried, \"You have mastered it!\"\n\nAfter Ji Chang had fully learned Fei Wei’s techniques, he calculated that in all the world, only one man could rival him. He plotted to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wild, and the two exchanged arrows. Midway, their arrowheads clashed and fell to the ground without stirring dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. Ji Chang loosed one final arrow, but Fei Wei deflected it with the tip of a thorn, missing not a hair. Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, bowed to each other on the road, and pledged to become father and son. They swore an oath, cutting their arms, never to teach their art to another.\n\nZaofu’s master was named Taidou. When Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with utmost humility, yet Taidou did not instruct him for three years. Zaofu’s reverence only deepened, until Taidou finally said, \"An ancient poem says, ‘The son of a fine bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a fine smelter must first sew furs.’ First observe my steps. When you can move as I do, then you may hold the six reins and drive the six horses.\" Zaofu replied, \"I shall follow your command.\" Taidou then set up a path of wooden planks, just wide enough for his feet, measured in steps and laid out. He walked upon it, running back and forth without stumbling. Zaofu learned this in three days, mastering its skill. Taidou sighed, \"How quick you are! You have grasped it swiftly.

Extending this to charioteering, you harmonize the reins and bits with perfect accord, adjusting swiftness and slowness to the harmony of the lips and tongue. You establish the proper measure within your breast and hold the rhythm in your grasp. Internally, you attain it in your center, and externally, you align with the horse’s will. Thus, you can advance and retreat as if treading a cord, turn and curve as if compass-drawn, traverse great distances with energy to spare—truly, you have mastered the art.\n\nYou grasp it in the bit and respond with the reins; you grasp it in the reins and respond with your hands; you grasp it in your hands and respond with your heart. Then, without relying on your eyes or urging with the whip, your mind is at ease, your body upright, the six reins unconfused, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, advancing, or retreating, nothing fails to meet the rhythm. Thereafter, beyond the wheels of your chariot, no trace of tracks remains; beyond the hooves of your horses, no ground is left untouched. You will never perceive the peril of mountains and valleys or the flatness of plains and open land—they will all appear as one. My art is exhausted; remember it well.\n\nWei Hei’luan, on account of a private grudge, killed Qiu Bingzhang. Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Lai Dan’s qi was fierce, his form exposed; he ate by counting grains and moved with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact revenge, for he disdained to borrow strength from others. He swore to slaughter Hei’luan with his own hands and sword.\n\nHei’luan’s ferocity surpassed all others, his strength equal to a hundred men. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh were not of mortal kind. He would stretch his neck to meet the blade, bare his chest to receive arrows, yet even when the point bent against him, his body bore no mark or wound. Confident in his strength, he regarded Lai Dan as a mere fledgling.\n\nLai Dan’s friend, Shen Tuo, said, “Your hatred for Hei’luan is profound, and his underestimation of you is excessive. What plan will you devise?” Lai Dan wept and replied, “I beg you to devise one for me.” Shen Tuo said, “I have heard that Kong Zhou of Wei, a descendant of his lineage, possesses a treasured sword from the Yin emperor. When a mere youth wore it, he repelled the armies of three hosts. Why not seek it from him?”\n\nLai Dan then went to Wei and met Kong Zhou, serving him with the rites of a charioteer. He first offered his wife and children as collateral, then stated his desire. Kong Zhou said, “I have three swords; choose whichever you wish. None can kill a man, but let me first describe their forms.\n\nThe first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light). When you look at it, it cannot be seen; when you wield it, you do not know it is there. Where it touches, it vanishes without boundary, passing through things without their awareness.\n\nThe second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow). At the break of dawn, in the mingling of light and dark, or at dusk, in the blending of day and night, if you face north and observe it, faintly, as if something exists, yet its form cannot be discerned. Where it touches, there is a faint sound, passing through things without harming them.\n\nThe third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night Silk). In daylight, you see its shadow but not its light; at night, you see its light but not its form. Where it touches, it passes through swiftly, closing instantly behind it, leaving a sensation of speed but no bloodshed.\n\nThese three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. They lie sealed in their caskets, never unsealed.” Lai Dan said, “Even so, I must request the lowest of them.”\n\nKong Zhou then returned Lai Dan’s wife and children and fasted with him for seven days. At dusk, he knelt and presented the lowest sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed.\n\nLai Dan then took the sword and approached Hei’luan. At that time, Hei’luan was drunk, sprawled beneath a window. Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist, yet Hei’luan felt nothing. Taking Hei’luan for dead, Lai Dan hurried away. At the gate, he encountered Hei’luan’s son and struck him three times, as if thrusting into emptiness. Hei’luan’s son laughed and said, “Why are you so foolish as to wave at me thrice?” Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.\n\nWhen Hei’luan awoke, he raged at his wife, “You let me drink until I exposed myself! Now my throat is sore and my waist stiff.” His son said, “Earlier, Lai Dan came and met me at the gate. He waved at me three times, and now my body aches and my limbs are stiff. He must have cast a curse on me!”\n\nKing Mu of Zhou launched a great campaign against the Western Rong. The Western Rong presented him with a *Kun Wu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword was a foot and a handspan in length, its blade forged of refined steel and glowing red. When used, it cut jade as if it were mud. The fire-washed cloth, when washed, must be cast into fire. The cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime turns the color of the cloth. When removed from the fire and shaken, it gleams as if pure snow.\n\nThe Crown Prince believed no such things existed and dismissed the accounts as false. Xiao Shu said, “Your Highness is too certain in your own judgment, too quick to dismiss reason!” *The Central Scroll of the Perfect Dao of Profound Virtue* concludes here.\n\n**Force and Fate, Sixth Chapter**",

      "translated_text": "Beigongzi said to Ximenzi, “You and I are of the same generation, yet you are esteemed by others. We belong to the same clan, yet you are respected. We share the same appearance, yet you are beloved. We speak alike, yet your words are heeded. We act alike, yet your conduct is trusted. We both serve in office, yet you are honored. We both till the soil, yet you grow wealthy. We both engage in trade, yet you profit. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain, dwell in a thatched hut, and travel on foot. You wear embroidered brocade, feast on fine millet and meat, reside in a mansion with towering beams, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you are cheerful and seem to scorn me; at court, you are haughty and display contempt for me. You do not seek my favor, nor do we stroll together—this has been so for years. Do you consider your virtue superior to mine?”\n\nXimenzi replied, “I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of our differing fates? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is thick indeed.”\n\nBeigongzi had no reply. He departed in dismay.\n\nOn the road, he encountered Master Dongguo. The master said, “Where have you been, that you return with such a dejected gait and a look of deep shame?”\n\nBeigongzi recounted what had happened.\n\nMaster Dongguo said, “I will relieve your shame. Let us go together to Ximen’s house and question him. Say: ‘Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi?’ Speak plainly.”\n\nXimenzi said, “Beigongzi claims we share the same generation, clan, age, appearance, speech, and conduct, yet our status and wealth differ. I told him: ‘I have no way to know the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of our differing fates? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is thick indeed.’”\n\nMaster Dongguo said, “Your notion of ‘fate’ refers only to differences in talent and virtue. My notion of ‘fate’ is different. Beigongzi is rich in virtue but poor in fate; you are rich in fate but poor in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Yet you boast of your favorable fate, while Beigongzi feels shame for his virtue—neither of you understands the principle of what is inherently so.”\n\nXimenzi said, “Enough, Master. I dare not speak further.”\n\nAfter Beigongzi returned home, he wore his coarse hemp, which was as warm as fox or raccoon fur. He ate his coarse beans, which tasted as fine as rice and millet. He sheltered in his thatched hut, which shaded like a grand hall. He rode in his humble cart, which seemed as ornate as a carved chariot. For the rest of his life, he remained content, unaware of honor or disgrace lying in others rather than himself.\n\nMaster Dongguo, hearing of this, said, “Beigongzi has slept for a long time. A single word awakened him—how easily he was enlightened!”\n\nGuan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were close friends, bound by deep affection, and both lived in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi ruling house had many favored sons, with legitimate and illegitimate heirs competing. The people feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Later, when Duke Wuzhi rebelled and Qi was left without a ruler, the two princes raced to return. Guan Yiwu fought Xiaobai on the road to Ju, shooting an arrow that struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he pressured Lu to kill Prince Jiu. Shao Hu died for him, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.\n\nBao Shuya said to Duke Huan, “Guan Yiwu is capable—he can govern the state.”\n\nDuke Huan replied, “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.”\n\nBao Shuya said, “I have heard that a worthy ruler harbors no personal grudges. Moreover, one who serves his lord faithfully will surely serve his ruler well. If you wish to become a hegemon, you cannot do without Yiwu. You must pardon him.”\n\nThereupon, Duke Huan summoned Guan Zhong. When Lu returned him to Qi, Bao Shuya welcomed him beyond the city gates and freed him from his bonds. Duke Huan treated him with honor, placing him above Gao and Guo. Bao Shuya humbled himself before him, entrusting him with state affairs and addressing him as “Father Zhong.” Duke Huan thus became a hegemon.\n\nGuan Zhong once sighed, saying, “When I was young and poor, I once traded with Bao Shuya, taking more than my share of the profits. Bao Shuya did not think me greedy, knowing I was impoverished. I once devised a plan for Bao Shuya that led to great failure. He did not think me foolish, knowing that circumstances have their favorable and unfavorable moments. I was employed three times and dismissed three times by my lords. Bao Shuya did not think me worthless, knowing I had not met with the right time. I fought three battles and fled three times. He did not think me cowardly, knowing I had an elderly mother to care for. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I was imprisoned and humiliated. Bao Shuya did not think me shameless, knowing I did not scorn minor setbacks but felt shame if my name were not renowned throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shuya truly knew me.”\n\nThis is why the world praises Guan and Bao for their fine friendship, and Xiaobai for his skill in employing the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor any skill in employing the capable. There was no fine friendship, no skill in employing the capable—it was not that there was some other fine friendship or skill in employing the capable. Shao Hu did not choose to die; he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy; he had no choice but to recommend them. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy; he had no choice but to employ him.\n\nWhen Guan Yiwu fell ill, Xiaobai visited him and said, “Father Zhong’s illness is grave. You must not conceal it. If it becomes critical, to whom should I entrust the state?”\n\nYiwu asked, “Whom do you wish to appoint?”\n\nXiaobai said, “Bao Shuya will do.”\n\nYiwu replied, “He will not do. He is a man of integrity and a fine gentleman. Toward those who are not his equal, he does not associate with them. Once he hears of a person’s faults, he never forgets them for the rest of his life.”",

His offense against his lord will not be long in coming.”\n\nXiaobai said, “Then who will do?”\n\nYiwu replied, “If you must have someone, then Yang Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his lord, below he does not betray the people. He feels shame before those who surpass him like the Yellow Emperor and pities those who fall short of him. To share virtue with others is called a sage; to share wealth with others is called a worthy. To rule others with worth is never to win them; to humble oneself before others with worth is never to fail to win them. In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see. If you must have someone, then Xi Peng will do.”\n\nYet Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shuya—he had no choice but to slight him; nor did he favor Xi Peng—he had no choice but to favor him.

Yet Zichan did not choose to use the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he had no choice but to use it; Deng Xi did not choose to yield to Zichan—he had no choice but to yield; Zichan did not choose to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to execute him.\n\nTo live when one ought to live is Heaven’s blessing; to die when one ought to die is Heaven’s blessing. To live when one ought not to live is Heaven’s punishment; to die when one ought not to die is Heaven’s punishment. To live when one can live, to die when one can die—such cases exist. To be unable to live, unable to die—yet to live or die—such cases exist as well. Yet life and death, life and death, are neither of things nor of the self; all is fate. Where wisdom is powerless, it is said:\n\n“Profound and boundless,\nthe Dao of Heaven meets of itself;\nvast and undivided,\nthe Dao of Heaven moves of itself.\nNeither Heaven nor Earth can transgress it,\nneither sages nor wisdom can interfere,\nneither ghosts nor spirits can deceive.\nThat which is natural—silently it completes,\ncalmly it pacifies,\nleading and guiding it.”\n\nYang Zhu’s friend Ji Liang fell ill, and after seven days, his condition worsened.

This appears contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, depth and shallowness, arise of themselves.

      "translated_text": "Day departs, day arrives—who can know its reason? All is fate. Those who trust in fate are without notions of long or short life; those who trust in principle are without notions of right or wrong; those who trust in the heart are without notions of compliance or defiance; those who trust in nature are without notions of safety or peril. This is called being without any fixed reliance, without any fixed distrust. Truly sincere and earnest—what should one reject, what should one embrace? What should one lament, what should one rejoice in? What should one do, what should one not do?\n\nThe *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: \"The perfected person abides as though dead, moves as though a machine. They do not know why they abide, nor why they do not abide; they do not know why they move, nor why they do not move. They do not alter their demeanor because of the gaze of the multitude, nor do they claim that their demeanor remains unchanged because the multitude does not gaze upon them. Alone they come, alone they go, alone they enter, alone they depart—who can obstruct them?\"\n\nMo Yin, Mei Chi, Chi Yi, and Nü—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never knew one another’s true feelings, each believing their own wisdom to be profound. Qiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nü Yu, and Pian Pi—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never spoke of guarding their words, each believing their own cunning to be subtle. Liao He, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never awakened to one another’s understanding, each believing their own talent to be sufficient. Mian Ting, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never reproached one another, each believing their own conduct to be without fault. Duo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li—these four roamed the world, each following their own will. Though they spent their years together, they never glanced at one another, each believing the times to be in accord with them.\n\nThese are the manifold dispositions of the world—their appearances are not uniform, yet all return to the Dao, for fate is where they converge. That which seems to succeed does so by chance, not by inherent success; that which seems to fail does so by chance, not by inherent failure. Thus confusion arises from chance, and in the moment of chance, all is obscure. If, in the midst of chance, one remains unobscured, then one is neither startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. Moving with the times, halting with the times—wisdom cannot fathom it.\n\nThose who trust in fate harbor no duality between self and other. Those who harbor duality between self and other would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, to turn their backs on cliffs and face the moat—even then, they would not stumble. Thus it is said: life and death come from fate; poverty and hardship come from the times. To resent an early death is to not know fate; to resent poverty and hardship is to not know the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing fate and being at peace with the times.\n\nIf one makes the wise calculate gains and losses, assess emptiness and fullness, gauge human sentiments, they may succeed or fail—yet both outcomes will be fitting. If one makes the unwise not calculate gains and losses, not assess emptiness and fullness, not gauge human sentiments, they too may succeed or fail—yet both outcomes will be fitting. Whether one calculates or not, assesses or not, gauges or not—what difference does it make? Only when there is neither calculation nor its absence can one be whole and without loss. Yet this is not knowing wholeness, nor knowing loss. One is whole of oneself, one loses of oneself, one perishes of oneself.\n\nDuke Jing of Qi traveled to Ox Mountain. Gazing north over his capital, he wept and sighed: \"How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I ever leave it and die?\" His attendants, Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju, both wept with him, saying: \"We rely on our lord’s grace. Though we eat coarse meat, ride broken-down chariots, and mount worn-out horses, we still do not wish to die—how much less our lord?\" Only Yanzi laughed beside them.\n\nThe duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi: \"Today’s outing has saddened me. Kong and Ju wept with me, yet you alone laugh—why?\" Yanzi replied: \"If worthy rulers could always preserve this land, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still possess it. If brave rulers could always preserve it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still possess it. Had these rulers preserved it, would you now be standing here in straw cloak and hat, tilling the fields, fretting over affairs, and dreading death? How then would you have come to occupy this position? It is because rulers alternately hold and relinquish it. Yet you alone weep for it—this is unkind. To see an unkind ruler and flattering ministers—these are the two things I secretly laugh at.\"\n\nDuke Jing was ashamed. He raised his cup to punish himself and made his two ministers each drink two cups as well.\n\nAmong the people of Wei was one Dongmen Wu, whose son died yet he did not grieve. His steward said: \"No one in the world loved their child more than you. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?\" Dongmen Wu replied: \"I once had no son, and in that time, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?\"\n\nFarmers rush to the seasons, merchants pursue profit, artisans chase skill, officials chase power—circumstances compel them. Yet farmers face drought and flood, merchants face gain and loss, artisans face success and failure, officials face favor and disfavor—fate compels them.\n\n---\n\nYang Zhu, Part Seven\n\nYang Zhu traveled to Lu and lodged with the Meng family. Meng asked: \"A man is but a man—why must he have a name?\" Yang Zhu replied: \"A name is for becoming wealthy.\" \"Once wealthy, why not stop?\"",

Yet in lifespan, they are as father and son; in rank, they are as father and son; in reputation, they are as father and son; in love and hate, they are as father and son. I am perplexed by this.”\n\nYangzi said, “The ancients had a saying, which I have come to understand and will tell you: what is so without knowing why it is so—this is fate. Now, in confusion and obscurity, in a tangle of indistinctness, one follows what is done and what is not done.”",

Yet those who ride upon a name bestow blessings upon their clan, extend benefits to their village, and all the more to their descendants. Generally, those who pursue a name must be incorruptible, and incorruptibility leads to poverty. Those who pursue a name must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.\"\n\nMeng said: \"When Guan Zhong served as minister to the Duke of Qi, if the ruler was dissolute, he was dissolute; if the ruler was extravagant, he was extravagant. Their wills aligned, their words followed, and the Dao was enacted—thus the state became hegemonic. Yet after his death, only the Guan family remained. When the Tian family served as ministers to the Duke of Qi, if the ruler was full, they diminished themselves; if the ruler levied taxes, they distributed alms. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess the state of Qi. Their descendants have enjoyed it to this day without end. If genuine fame leads to poverty, then false fame leads to wealth.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Genuine substance lacks fame, and fame lacks substance. Fame is but falsity. In ancient times, Yao and Shun falsely offered the world to Xu You and Shan Juan, yet did not lose the world and enjoyed a reign of a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi genuinely relinquished the rulership of Guzhu, yet ultimately lost their state and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between genuine and false is as clear as this.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"A hundred years is the greatest span of life. Among a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, from infancy to senility, nearly half is spent thus. The time lost to nightly sleep and daytime oblivion is nearly another half. Pain, illness, sorrow, loss, worry, and fear occupy yet another half. Measuring these few years, the moments of unburdened ease and self-contentment, free from even the slightest concern, are but fleeting. Then for what does man live? For what does he delight? For fine food and comfort? For music and beauty? Yet fine food and comfort cannot always satisfy, nor can music and beauty always be enjoyed. Then one is further constrained by rewards and punishments, advanced or withdrawn by fame and law, anxiously competing for an ephemeral reputation in one’s time, scheming for posthumous glory. Cautiously guarding what the ears hear and the eyes see, sparing the body and mind from judgment, one merely forfeits the supreme joy of the present, unable to indulge even for a moment. Bound in heavy shackles, how is this different from imprisonment?\n\nThe people of great antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn and death a brief departure. Thus they followed their hearts and acted without resisting their natural desires. The joys of the present were not forsaken, so they were not swayed by fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, not opposing the inclinations of the myriad things. Posthumous renown was not sought, so they were not touched by punishments. Fame and reputation, longevity and brevity—these were not their concern.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"What distinguishes the myriad things is life; what they share is death. In life, there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are their differences. In death, there is putrefaction and decay—this they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base are not of their own making, nor are putrefaction and decay. Thus life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies, worthiness is not what one is worthy, foolishness is not what one is foolish, nobility is not what one is noble, baseness is not what one is base. Yet the myriad things equally live, equally die, equally are worthy, equally are foolish, equally are noble, equally are base. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is sagely and benevolent or cruel and foolish, in life one may be Yao or Shun, in death one is but rotting bones; in life one may be Jie or Zhou, in death one is but rotting bones. All is the same—who knows the difference? Therefore, hasten to the present life—why concern oneself with what comes after death?\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Boyi did not lack desire; his insistence on purity led him to starve. Zhan Ji did not lack emotion; his insistence on chastity led to the decline of his lineage. The errors of purity and chastity lie in this.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"Yuan Xian was impoverished in Lu, while Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, and Zigong’s wealth burdened his body. Thus neither poverty nor wealth is acceptable—where then lies what is acceptable?\"\nHe replied: \"What is acceptable lies in delighting in life and easing the body. Therefore, those who delight in life are not impoverished, and those who ease the body do not amass wealth.\"\n\nYang Zhu said: \"An ancient saying goes: 'In life, we cherish one another; in death, we cast one another aside.' This saying is perfect. The way of cherishing is not merely about affection—it is about diligence bringing ease, hunger bringing satiety, cold bringing warmth, and poverty bringing success. The way of casting aside is not about lack of sorrow—it is about not burying pearls and jade, not dressing in embroidered silks, not offering sacrificial animals, and not preparing funerary objects.\"\n\nYan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu said: \"Let it be free—do not obstruct or restrain it.\"\nYan Pingzhong said: \"What does this entail?\"\nYiwu said: \"Indulge the ears in what they desire to hear, the eyes in what they desire to see, the nose in what it desires to smell, the mouth in what it desires to speak, the body in what it desires for comfort, and the mind in what it desires to do. What the ears desire to hear is sound, and if they cannot, it is called obstructing hearing. What the eyes desire to see is beauty, and if they cannot, it is called obstructing sight. What the nose desires to smell is fragrance, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing scent. What the mouth desires to express is right and wrong, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing wisdom. What the body desires for comfort is fine food and ease, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing comfort. What the mind desires to do is indulgence, and if it cannot, it is called obstructing nature. All these obstructions are the tyrants of oppression. Remove these oppressive tyrants, and await death in carefree ease—whether a day, a month, a year, or a decade—this is what I call nurturing.\"",

After three years, the virtuous submitted to his transformation, the wicked feared his prohibitions, and Zheng was well-ordered, so that the feudal lords stood in awe of it. Yet he had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.\n\nIn Chao’s chambers, wine was amassed by the thousand *zhong*, yeast piled like hills; from a hundred paces outside the gate, the scent of sweet liquor assailed the nose. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s peace or peril, the regrets and resentments of human affairs, the prosperity or ruin of his household, the closeness or distance of his nine clans, or the sorrows and joys of survival and loss. Even if water and fire, weapons and blades clashed before him, he remained unaware.\n\nMu’s rear courtyard contained dozens of adjoining chambers, all filled with women chosen for their youthful beauty, their grace and allure. When he was engrossed in sensual pleasures, he shunned his kin, severed ties with friends, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, and even then, his desires were not fully satisfied. If there was a maiden of exceptional beauty in the village, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and only cease if he failed to obtain her.\n\nZichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi and consulted him, saying, \"I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this means beginning with what is near and proceeding to what is far. I have brought order to the state, yet my family remains in chaos. Is my Dao perverse? What method can save these two?\"\nDeng Xi replied, \"I have long been perplexed by this but dared not speak first. Why do you not admonish them in due time, explaining the weight of life and destiny, and guiding them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?\"\n\nZichan followed Deng Xi’s advice. Taking advantage of an opportunity, he met with his brothers and said to them, \"What makes humans noble above beasts is wisdom. What wisdom guides is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, fame and rank follow. But if one acts on impulse, indulging in desires, then life and destiny are imperiled. If you heed my words, by morning you will repent, and by evening you will enjoy emoluments.\"\n\nChao and Mu replied, \"We have long known this and have long deliberated on it—do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to encounter, while death comes easily. Clinging to this hard-won life while awaiting an easily met death—how can one not ponder this deeply? Yet you wish to exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, to feign refinement and seek fame. We consider this no better than death. We desire to exhaust life’s joys and fulfill the pleasures of our years, fearing only that our bellies will be too full to drink our fill, our strength too spent to indulge our passions. We have no leisure to worry about disgraceful reputations or the peril to our lives. Moreover, you boast of your ability to govern the state, seeking to sway our hearts with fine words and delight us with honors and emoluments—is this not base and pitiable? We wish to part ways with you on this.\n\nThose who excel at governing externals may not bring order to things, yet their own bodies suffer; those who excel at governing internals may not bring chaos to things, yet their natures find ease. Your method of governing externals may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our method of governing internals can be extended to all under heaven, and the Dao of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to explain this art to you, yet you instead seek to instruct us with that art?\"\n\nZichan was left speechless.

      "translated_text": "Whatever the people desired to do, whatever human inclinations longed to enjoy—he did it all, he indulged in it all. His walls and chambers, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu. As for what his heart truly desired, what his ears longed to hear, his eyes to see, his mouth to taste—even if it came from distant lands or remote regions, from places where Qi’s soil did not nurture it, he would inevitably obtain it, as if it were but a thing within his garden walls. When he traveled, though mountains and rivers blocked his path, though the roads were long and winding, he would inevitably go, as if it were but a few steps from his door. Daily, a hundred guests filled his halls; his kitchens never ceased their smoke and flame, his halls never stilled their music.\n\nAfter providing for his own needs, he first distributed the surplus to his clan; after the clan was satisfied, he next gave to his village; and after the village was provided for, he then scattered the rest throughout the state. At sixty, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs, dispersing his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, and concubines. Within a year, all was gone—he left no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, there were no medicines stored; when he died, there were no funds for burial. The people of the state who had received his gifts gathered to contribute, returning his wealth to his descendants.\n\nQin Guli heard of this and said, \"Duanmu Shu is a madman—he has shamed his ancestors.\" Duan Yu Sheng heard of it and said, \"Mu Shu is an enlightened man—his virtue surpasses that of his ancestors. What he did, what he pursued, may shock the common mind, yet it is truly in accord with principle.\"\n\nMany of the gentlemen of Wei held fast to ritual and teaching, yet none could fathom this man’s heart.\n\nMengsun Yang asked Master Yang, \"Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking not to die—would that be acceptable?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"In principle, there is no not-dying.\"\n\"Then seeking long life—would that be acceptable?\"\n\"In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body made whole by cherishing it. And what is the use of long life? The five emotions—likes and dislikes—are the same now as in ancient times; the safety or peril of the four limbs is the same now as in ancient times; the bitterness and joy of worldly affairs are the same now as in ancient times; the shifts between order and chaos are the same now as in ancient times. You have heard of these things, you have seen them, you have experienced them—yet you still find a hundred years too long. How much more would you resent the suffering of an even longer life?\"\n\nMengsun Yang said, \"If that is so, then swift death is better than long life. Then to tread upon blades, to plunge into boiling water—would that fulfill one’s will?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"Not so. Once born, let go and follow it, exhausting what you desire until death comes. When death approaches, let go and follow it, exhausting where it leads until all is spent. Let go of everything, follow everything—why rush between early or late?\"\n\nYang Zhu said, \"Bo Chengzi Gao did not use even a hair’s benefit for others, abandoning his state to live in reclusion and till the soil. Great Yu did not use his own body for self-benefit, leaving one side of his body withered. The ancients would not give up even a hair to benefit the world, nor would they take the whole world to serve a single body. If each person does not give up even a hair, if each person does not benefit the world, the world will be well-ordered.\"\n\nQinzi asked Yang Zhu, \"If you could pluck a single hair from your body to save the world, would you do it?\"\nMaster Yang said, \"The world is certainly not saved by a single hair.\"\nQinzi said, \"But if it could be saved, would you do it?\"\nMaster Yang did not answer.\n\nQinzi went out and told Mengsun Yang, saying, \"You do not understand the Master’s heart—I will explain it to you. Suppose someone could gain ten thousand gold pieces by harming your flesh—would you do it?\"\nMengsun Yang said, \"I would.\"\nQinzi said, \"Suppose you could gain a state by severing one of your limbs—would you do it?\"\nQinzi fell silent for a moment. Mengsun Yang said, \"A single hair is less than flesh, flesh is less than a limb—this is obvious. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that flesh is formed, by accumulating flesh that limbs are formed. A single hair is but one ten-thousandth of the body—how can you treat it lightly?\"\n\nQinzi said, \"I cannot answer you. But if you asked Lao Dan or Guan Yin with your words, your words would be correct. If I asked Yu or Mo Di with my words, my words would be correct.\"\n\nMengsun Yang then turned to his disciples and spoke of other matters.\n\nYang Zhu said, \"The world’s praise gathers upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius; its blame gathers upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun tilled the fields at Heyang and made pottery at Leize—his four limbs never knew a moment’s rest, his mouth and belly never tasted fine fare. His parents were not at ease, his younger siblings were not close. At thirty, he married without informing them. When he received Yao’s abdication, he was already old, his wisdom already in decline. When Shangjun proved unworthy, he abdicated to Yu, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man exhausted with suffering. Gun’s work in governing the waters and lands was not completed, and he was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited his task, avenging his father’s grudge, focusing only on the wild lands’ labor. His son was not raised, he passed his door without entering, his body was withered on one side, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he lived in a humble palace, wore plain robes and caps, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man burdened with toil. After King Wu died, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou took up the Son of Heaven’s governance. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors. He lived in the east for three years, executing his elder brother and exiling his younger brother, barely escaping with his life, living in sorrow until his death—this was a man whom Heaven and man filled with peril and fear. Confucius clarified the Way of the emperors and kings, responding to the summons of the rulers of his time. He was barred from trees in Song, his traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, living in sorrow until his death.\"",

All four of those sages lived without a single day of joy, yet died with names enduring for ten thousand generations. A name, however, is not what reality seeks. Though praised, they knew it not; though rewarded, they knew it not—no different from a stump or clod of earth.\n\nJie inherited generations of wealth, occupying the honored seat of the sovereign. His wisdom sufficed to overawe his subjects, his might to shake the realm within the seas. He indulged his ears and eyes to their fullest, exhausted every desire of his heart and mind, living in bliss until his death—this was the dissolute among Heaven’s people. Zhou, too, inherited generations of wealth, occupying the honored seat of the sovereign. His power knew no bounds, his will no defiance. He gave free rein to his passions in the *Qinggong*, indulged his desires through long nights, never burdening himself with ritual and righteousness, living in bliss until his execution—this was the wanton among Heaven’s people.\n\nThose two tyrants enjoyed the pleasures of following every desire in life, yet died bearing the names of fools and brutes. Reality, however, is not what names bestow. Though reviled, they knew it not; though praised, they knew it not—how were they different from a stump or clod of earth?

      "translated_text": "Great bells and grand chimes cannot accompany frantic, bustling dances. Why? Their tones are too sparse. One who would govern great things does not govern trifles; one who would achieve great deeds does not fuss over small matters—this is what is meant.\n\nYang Zhu said: The affairs of the distant past have perished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns exist as if they exist not; the affairs of the Five Emperors seem like waking dreams; the undertakings of the Three Kings now hide, now appear—of a hundred, not one is known. Even the matters of one’s own lifetime, some heard, some seen—of ten thousand, not one is known. The events before one’s eyes, some preserved, some discarded—of a thousand, not one is known. From the distant past to the present day, the years are too many to count. Since the time of Fuxi, over three hundred thousand years have passed—yet the wise and foolish, the fair and foul, success and failure, right and wrong, all have vanished, differing only in how swiftly they fade.\n\nTo pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, to exhaust one’s spirit and body in pursuit of it, and to seek a lingering name for a few hundred years after death—how can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in such a life?\n\nYang Zhu said: Humans resemble the class of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants. Among all living things, humans are the most spiritually endowed. Yet human claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh inadequate for self-protection, their speed and agility unable to escape harm or seize advantage. Lacking fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, they must rely on external things to nourish their nature, employing wisdom rather than brute force.\n\nThus, what wisdom values is preserving the self; what force devalues is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not truly belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it. External things do not truly belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot but keep them. The body is the master of life; external things are the masters of sustenance. Though one preserves life, one cannot claim ownership of the body; though one does not discard external things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of the body or things is to selfishly monopolize what belongs to the world.\n\nIs this not the way of the sage? To regard the body as belonging to the world, to regard things as belonging to the world—this is the way of the perfected person. This is what is called the utmost perfection.\n\nYang Zhu said: The people cannot rest because of four things: longevity, fame, rank, and wealth. Possessing these four, they fear ghosts, fear others, fear authority, and fear punishment—such are those who flee from themselves. Their lives may be taken or spared, but control lies outside them.\n\nIf one does not defy fate, why crave longevity? If one does not pride oneself on nobility, why crave fame? If one does not seek power, why crave rank? If one does not covet riches, why crave wealth? Such are those who follow the natural order. The world holds no opposition for them; control lies within.\n\nThus, the saying goes: If a person neither marries nor enters officialdom, half their desires fade. If a person lacks clothing and food, the way of ruler and subject ceases. A Zhou proverb says: A farmer can be killed by sitting idle. Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant way of life; eating beans and greens, he takes this as the height of flavor.",

      "translated_text": "Coarse and thick of flesh, with sinews knotted and limbs taut and tense—if such a one is suddenly placed amidst soft furs and silken curtains, offered fine grains and meats, orchids and citrus, the heart grows restless, the body vexed, and internal heat gives rise to illness. Should the lords of Shang and Lu exchange places with a field laborer, they would not endure even a single season before exhaustion overtook them. Thus, what the rustic finds at ease, what the rustic deems fair—these he calls unmatched under heaven.\n\nOnce in the state of Song there was a farmer who wore only tattered hemp to survive the winter. When spring came and the eastern fields called, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s vast halls and secluded chambers, of silk floss and fox furs. Turning to his wife, he said: “The warmth of the sun at one’s back—none know its worth. If I offered it to our lord, great reward would surely follow.” A wealthy man of the village told him: “Long ago, a man praised his fine wild beans, sweet flax stalks, water celery, and duckweed seeds to the local magnate. The magnate took them and tasted—his mouth stung, his belly ached, and all mocked and reviled him. The man was deeply shamed. You are of this kind.”\n\nYang Zhu said: “Grand houses, fine robes, rich flavors, fair faces—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Insatiable nature is the bane of yin and yang. Loyalty is not enough to secure a ruler; it is enough only to endanger oneself. Righteousness is not enough to benefit others; it is enough only to harm one’s own life. Peace for superiors does not arise from loyalty, and so the name of loyalty perishes. Benefit for others does not arise from righteousness, and so the name of righteousness is severed. The mutual peace of ruler and subject, the mutual benefit of self and others—this was the Way of antiquity.”\n\nMaster Yu said: “Abandon fame, and you will have no cares.” Laozi said: “Fame is but the guest of reality.” Yet the careless pursue fame without cease. If fame cannot be abandoned, can it not at least be treated as a guest? Now, with fame comes honor and glory; without fame, humiliation and disgrace. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; humiliation and disgrace bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it. These are bound to reality. How can fame be abandoned? How can fame be treated as a guest? The true evil lies in clinging to fame at the cost of reality. Clinging to fame at the cost of reality will leave one so preoccupied with impending ruin that one cannot be saved—how much less can one dwell between ease and sorrow?\n\n---\n\n*Sayings Aligned* (Chapter Eight)\n\nMaster Liezi studied under Master Hushu Zilin. Hushu Zilin said: “If you understand how to hold back, then we may speak of how to conduct yourself.” Liezi said: “I wish to hear of holding back.” The master said: “Look at your shadow, and you will know.” Liezi turned and observed his shadow: when his form bent, the shadow curved; when his form straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness follow the form and do not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depend on the object and not on oneself. This is what it means to hold back and yet be foremost.\n\nGuan Yin said to Master Liezi: “Fair words yield a fair echo; foul words yield a foul echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. Fame is the echo; the body is the shadow. Thus it is said: Be cautious in your words, for they will be answered. Be cautious in your conduct, for it will be followed. Therefore, the sage observes the outward to know the inward, examines the past to know the future—this is the principle by which he knows beforehand. Measure lies within oneself; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them. Tang and Wu loved all under heaven, and so they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under heaven, and so they perished. This is what is verified. When verification and measure are both clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving not by the gate or walking not by the path. Seeking profit thus—is it not difficult?”\n\nI have observed the virtue of Shennong and the Flame Emperor, examined the records of Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou, and weighed the words of learned scholars and worthy men. In all cases of survival and ruin, decline and rise, none have succeeded without following this Way.\n\nYan Hui said: “Those who inquire about the Way do so for wealth.” “Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—what need have I for the Way?” Master Liezi said: “Jie and Zhou prized profit and scorned the Way, and so they perished. Fortunately, I have not yet spoken to you of this. A man without righteousness, who eats only to fill his belly, is no better than a chicken or a dog. To eat voraciously without purpose, with the stronger dominating—this is the way of birds and beasts. To be no better than chickens, dogs, birds, or beasts and yet desire others’ respect—this cannot be. If others do not respect you, then danger and disgrace will befall you.”\n\nLiezi had mastered archery and sought instruction from Master Guan Yin. The master said: “Do you know why you hit the mark?” He replied: “I do not.” Guan Yin said: “Not yet.” He withdrew and practiced. After three years, he returned to report to Master Guan Yin. The master said: “Do you know why you hit the mark?” Liezi said: “I know now.” Guan Yin said: “Good. Hold to this and do not lose it. This applies not only to archery but to governing a state and conducting oneself. Thus, the sage does not examine survival and ruin but examines their causes.”\n\nLiezi said: “Those of vibrant beauty are proud; those of great strength are aggressive. Neither can be spoken to of the Way. Thus, one does not speak of the Way to those with graying hair who have lost their way—how much less to the common run of men? Therefore, if one acts aggressively, none will instruct him. If none instruct him, he will be isolated and without aid. The worthy entrust matters to others, and so even in old age they do not decline, and even when wisdom is exhausted they do not falter. Thus, the difficulty in governing a state lies in knowing the worthy, not in being worthy oneself.”\n\nA man of Song crafted a mulberry leaf from jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its edges, stem, and veins were exquisitely detailed, its luster so fine that when mixed among real mulberry leaves, it could not be distinguished. This man then lived off his craft in the state of Song. Master Liezi heard of this and said: “If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, few things would have leaves.”",

The world holds no opposition for them; control lies within.\n\nThus, the saying goes: If a person neither marries nor enters officialdom, half their desires fade. If a person lacks clothing and food, the way of ruler and subject ceases. A Zhou proverb says: A farmer can be killed by sitting idle. Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant way of life; eating beans and greens, he takes this as the height of flavor.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on cleverness or skill.\n\nWhen Master Liezi was impoverished, his countenance bore the pallor of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng, saying: “Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao, yet he dwells in your state in such straits. Might this not suggest that you do not favor men of worth?” Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Liezi went out to meet the messenger, bowed twice, and declined. The messenger departed. Upon returning home, Liezi’s wife struck her breast and reproached him: “I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet here you are, starving, and when the ruler, moved by your plight, sends you food, you refuse it. Is this not fate?” Liezi smiled and said to her: “The ruler does not know me personally. He sent me grain only because of another’s words, and if he were to punish me, it would likewise be on another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.” In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\nThe Shi family of Lu had two sons: one devoted to learning, the other to military arts. The one fond of learning offered his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who accepted him and appointed him tutor to the noble scions. The one fond of military arts went to Chu and presented his methods to the King of Chu, who was pleased and made him military commander. Their salaries enriched the family, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.\n\nThe Meng family, neighbors of the Shi, also had two sons with the same pursuits, yet they were mired in poverty. Envying the Shi family’s success, they sought their advice on how to advance. The two sons truthfully told them what they had done. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and offered his arts to the King of Qin. The king said: “Nowadays, the feudal lords contend with force, and all they concern themselves with are arms and provisions. If I were to govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin.” He then castrated the man and banished him. The other son went to Wei and presented his methods to the Marquis of Wei. The marquis said: “My state is weak, hemmed in by powerful neighbors. I serve the great states and soothe the small ones—this is the way to seek security. If I were to rely on military power, destruction would soon follow. If I let you return unharmed, you would only go to another state and become a grave threat to me.” He then had the man’s feet cut off and sent him back to Lu.\n\nUpon their return, the father and sons of the Meng family beat their breasts and reproached the Shi family. The Shi said: “Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your results differ—this is because you missed the moment, not because your conduct was flawed. Moreover, in the world, principles have no constant right, and affairs no constant wrong. What was once used may now be discarded; what is now discarded may later be used. This use and disuse have no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities and adapting to the times, responding to affairs without fixed methods—this depends on wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one were as learned as Confucius or as skilled as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?” The Meng father and sons then relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: “We understand. Say no more.”\n\nDuke Wen of Jin went to a meeting, intending to attack Wei. His son, Chu, looked up to the sky and laughed. The duke asked why he laughed. Chu replied: “I was thinking of a neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home when, on the road, he saw a woman picking mulberry leaves. He was pleased and spoke to her, but when he turned to look at his wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I was laughing at this.” The duke grasped his meaning and called off the attack. He led his army back, but before they arrived, an enemy had already raided their northern border.\n\nThe state of Jin suffered from banditry. There was a man named Xi Qi of Yong who could discern a bandit’s appearance, reading their intentions in the subtlest movements of their brows and lashes. The Marquis of Jin employed him to identify bandits, and not one in a thousand escaped his notice. The marquis was delighted and told Zhao Wenzi: “I have found a man who can eliminate all bandits in the state. Why would I need more?” Wenzi said: “If our lord relies on spies to catch bandits, the bandits will never be eradicated, and Xi Yong will surely not die a natural death.” Soon after, the bandits plotted together: “The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong.” They then joined forces to kill him.\n\nThe marquis, greatly alarmed upon hearing this, immediately summoned Wenzi and told him: “Just as you said, Xi Yong is dead. But what method should we use to capture bandits?” Wenzi replied: “There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: ‘One who sees the fish in the depths brings misfortune; one who predicts hidden things invites calamity.’ If you wish to have no bandits, it would be better to promote the worthy and employ them, so that instruction is clear above and transformation flows below. When the people have a sense of shame, what need is there for bandits?” Thereupon, he appointed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.\n\nConfucius, returning to Lu from Wei, rested his carriage by a bridge over the Yellow River and gazed at the water. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*, where fish and soft-shelled turtles could not swim, and giant turtles could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: “This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*. Fish and soft-shelled turtles cannot swim here, and giant turtles cannot dwell here. Surely it is too perilous to cross?” The man paid no heed, waded across, and emerged unharmed.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius asked him, “Is this a skill? Or do you possess some Daoist technique? How is it that you could enter and emerge unscathed?”\n\nThe man replied, “When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust; when I emerged, I relied once more on loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the surging waves, and I dared not act out of self-interest. This is why I could enter and emerge again.”\n\nConfucius said to his disciples, “Take heed, all of you: if even water can be crossed by one who embodies loyalty and trust, how much more so with people?”\n\nBai Gong asked Confucius, “Can one speak to others in subtle words?”\n\nConfucius did not answer.\n\nBai Gong asked again, “If a stone is thrown into water, what then?”\n\nConfucius said, “My skilled diver could retrieve it.”\n\nBai Gong said, “If water is poured into water, what then?”\n\nConfucius replied, “When the waters of the Zi and Meng rivers mingle, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them.”\n\nBai Gong said, “Is it truly impossible to speak subtly with others?”\n\nConfucius said, “Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of words can do so. One who knows the meaning of words does not speak with mere words. Those who contend for fish get wet; those who chase beasts run—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the highest words transcend words, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial.”\n\nBai Gong, unable to prevail, later died in his bathhouse.\n\nViscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. Victorious, he captured the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren, and sent a messenger to report the news. Viscount Xiang was eating when the messenger arrived, and his expression turned troubled.\n\nHis attendant said, “Two cities fell in a single day—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord look troubled?”\n\nViscount Xiang said, “The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not last the morning; the midday sun does not linger. Now the virtue and conduct of the Zhao house have not been cultivated over time, yet two cities fell in a single day. How long before ruin reaches us?”\n\nWhen Confucius heard of this, he said, “The Zhao house will flourish. For it is through worry that one flourishes, and through joy that one perishes. Victory is not the difficult part—maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all often triumphed, yet in the end they met their downfall, for they did not understand how to maintain victory. Only a ruler who embodies the Dao can sustain it.”\n\nConfucius’s strength was such that he could force open the bolts of a city gate, yet he would not be known for his might. Mozi devised defenses against siege warfare, and Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he would not be known for his military skill. Thus, those who truly sustain victory make the strong appear weak.\n\nThere was a man of Song who diligently practiced benevolence and righteousness, unwavering for three generations. One day, his family’s black ox gave birth to a white calf. He asked Confucius about it, who said, “This is an auspicious omen. Offer it in sacrifice to the Supreme Lord.”\n\nA year later, the man’s father suddenly went blind. The ox again bore a white calf, and the father once more instructed his son to ask Confucius. The son said, “Last time, after asking, you lost your sight. Why ask again?”\n\nThe father replied, “The words of a sage first seem contrary but later align. The matter is not yet settled—go and ask again.”\n\nThe son returned to Confucius, who again said, “It is auspicious.” He instructed them to perform the sacrifice.\n\nThe son returned and reported this to his father, who said, “Do as Confucius says.”\n\nA year later, the son also went blind. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged its capital, the people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. The able-bodied all mounted the walls to fight, and more than half perished. But this man, because both he and his father were afflicted, were spared.

      "translated_text": "In Song there was a man called Lanzi who offered his skills to Duke Yuan of Song. The duke summoned him and had him demonstrate his art. Using two poles twice the length of his body, he bound them to his shins, then ran swiftly forward and back, juggling seven swords, tossing them in succession so that five were always in the air. The duke was greatly astonished and immediately bestowed upon him gold and silk.\n\nAnother Lanzi, skilled in the art of the swallow’s flight, heard of this and also presented himself to the duke. The duke grew furious, saying, “Formerly, a man with extraordinary skills sought my favor. Though his art was of no use, it happened that I was in a joyful mood, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. This one must have heard of it and come seeking my favor again, hoping for another reward.” He had the man seized and was about to execute him, but after a month he released him.\n\nDuke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le, “You are advanced in years. Among your descendants, is there anyone I might send to seek fine horses?” Bo Le replied, “A good horse can be known by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of the world—it is as if it vanishes, as if it disappears, as if it is lost, as if it never was. Such a horse leaves no dust, no tracks. My sons are all of mediocre talent; they can be taught to recognize a good horse, but not the horse of the world. There is one with whom I once shared the labor of gathering firewood and vegetables—his name is Jiu Fang Gao. In matters of horses, he is no less skilled than I.

Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said to him, “A failure! The one you sent to seek a horse cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know a fine horse?”\n\nBo Le sighed deeply and said, “Has it truly come to this? This is why his ability surpasses mine a thousandfold, ten thousandfold, beyond measure. What Jiu Fang Gao observes is the heavenly mechanism. He grasps its essence and forgets its form, attends to its inner nature and disregards its outward appearance. He sees what is to be seen and does not see what is not to be seen; he looks at what is to be looked at and ignores what is not to be looked at.

Thus, the root lies in the self—I dare not speak of the branches.”\n\nThe king said, “Well said.”\n\nAn elder of Huqiu said to Shusun Ao, “There are three sources of resentment among men—do you know them?” Shusun Ao asked, “What are they?” The elder replied, “Those of high rank are envied; those in great office are resented by their lord; those with generous emoluments are beset by grievances.”\n\nShusun Ao said, “As my rank grows higher, my aspirations grow humbler; as my office grows greater, my heart grows smaller; as my emoluments grow richer, my generosity grows broader.”",

      "translated_text": "Can this avoid the three resentments?” Shusun Ao, gravely ill and near death, instructed his son, “The king has repeatedly offered to enfeoff me, but I have refused. When I die, the king will enfeoff you—you must not accept any land of advantage. Between Chu and Yue lies a place called Qinqiu, a land of ill fortune with a most inauspicious name. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue are cunning; only this place can be held in perpetuity.”\n\nAfter Shusun Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son a fine domain. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead. It was granted, and to this day his descendants have not lost it.\n\nNiu Que was a great Confucian of Shangdang. Traveling down to Handan, he encountered bandits in the sands of Ou who seized all his clothing and carriage. Niu walked away unhurried, his face cheerful, showing no sign of distress. The bandits approached and asked the reason. He replied, “A gentleman does not harm what sustains him for the sake of what sustains it.”\n\nThe bandits exclaimed, “Ah! Truly a worthy man!” Then they conferred among themselves: “With his worth, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao and speaks of us, he will surely bring trouble upon us. Better to kill him.” So they pursued and slew him.\n\nWhen the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another, “If you meet bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdang.” All took heed.\n\nShortly after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he fought them fiercely. When he could not prevail, he pursued them with humble pleas for his belongings. The bandits grew enraged: “We spared your life—how generous!—yet you pursue us without end. Your tracks will betray us. Since we are already bandits, where is the benevolence in that?” They killed him and slaughtered four or five of his companions as well.\n\nThe Yu family was a wealthy household of Liang. Their wealth was abundant, their money and silks beyond measure, their treasures beyond estimation. They ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where they set out music and wine and played dice. As knights-errant passed by below, one of the gamblers on the tower shot a dice throw, hitting the bright marker squarely. The pieces were flipped, the wooden counters clacked, and they laughed—just as a kite swooped down and dropped a rotting rat, striking the target.\n\nThe knights-errant said to one another, “The Yu family has enjoyed wealth and pleasure for too long, yet they have always held others in contempt. They did not attack us directly but instead insulted us with a rotting rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no standing among the knights of the world.” They vowed as one, “Let us unite in purpose, lead our followers, and destroy their household utterly.”\n\nOn the appointed night, they gathered their forces and weapons, attacked the Yu family, and annihilated them.\n\nIn the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu. As he set out on a journey, he grew hungry along the way. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu had eaten three times, he could finally see. He asked, “Who are you?”\n\n“I am Qiu of Hufu.”\n\nYuan Jingmu exclaimed, “Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I will not eat the food of a bandit on principle.” He pressed his hands to the ground and retched, but nothing came up. He coughed and gasped until, exhausted, he collapsed and died.\n\nThe man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food was not stolen. To call the food “bandit’s food” simply because the man was a bandit, and thus refuse to eat, is to confuse name and reality.\n\nZhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju. Believing the duke did not understand him, he left and dwelt by the sea. In summer he ate water caltrop and water chestnut; in winter he ate acorns. When Duke Ao of Ju faced calamity, Zhu Lishu took leave of his friends and went to die for him.\n\nHis friends said, “You left because you believed he did not understand you. Now you go to die for him—how is understanding or not understanding to be distinguished?”\n\nZhu Lishu replied, “Not so. I left because I believed he did not understand me. Now, if I die for him, it proves he truly did not understand me. I will die to shame those rulers of later generations who do not understand their ministers. To die for one who understands you, and not to die for one who does not—this is to follow the straight Way.”\n\nZhu Lishu may be called one who resented injustice to the point of forgetting himself.\n\nYang Zhu said, “Benefit given brings benefit in return; resentment sent forth brings harm in return. What is initiated here finds response abroad—only requests are exempt. Thus the worthy are cautious in what they put forth.”\n\nA neighbor of Master Yang lost a sheep. He led his own followers and also asked Master Yang’s servants to join the pursuit. Master Yang exclaimed, “Ah! To lose one sheep, why so many pursuers?”\n\nThe neighbor replied, “There are many branching paths.”\n\nWhen they returned, Master Yang asked, “Did you recover the sheep?”\n\n“It is lost.”\n\n“How was it lost?”\n\n“Among the branching paths were yet more branches. We did not know which way to go, so we turned back.”\n\nMaster Yang’s countenance fell, and his expression changed. He did not speak for a long while, nor did he smile for the rest of the day. His disciples found this strange and asked, “The sheep is a lowly beast, and not even yours. Why does its loss affect your speech and laughter so?”\n\nMaster Yang did not answer, and his disciples did not understand his meaning.\n\nHis disciple Meng Sunyang went out and told Xin Duzi. Later, Xin Duzi and Meng Sunyang entered together and asked, “Once there were three brothers who traveled between Qi and Lu, studying under the same master and learning the Way of benevolence and righteousness before returning home. Their father asked, ‘What is the Way of benevolence and righteousness like?’\n\nThe eldest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life and put reputation second.’\n\nThe second said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to achieve reputation.’\n\nThe youngest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me preserve both life and reputation.’\n\nThese three methods are opposed, yet all derive from the Confucians. Which is right, and which is wrong?”\n\nMaster Yang replied, “There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in water, brave in swimming, he plied a boat to ferry passengers, earning enough to feed a hundred mouths. He packed provisions and took on students, who came in droves. Yet nearly half drowned. They came to learn swimming, not drowning, yet the profit and harm turned out thus.”",

      "translated_text": "So he went to the stables of the Tian family, where he worked as an assistant to the horse-doctor in exchange for food. Someone in the city mocked him: “Working for a horse-doctor for your meals—isn’t that shameful?” The beggar replied: “Of all shames in the world, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could working for a horse-doctor be?”\n\nA man from Song was traveling along a road when he found a discarded tally. He took it home and hid it, carefully counting its teeth. He told his neighbor: “My wealth is soon to come.” There was a man who had a withered parasol tree. His elderly neighbor said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious, so the man immediately cut it down. The neighbor then asked to take it as firewood, but the man grew displeased and said: “That old neighbor only wanted it for firewood, yet he urged me to cut it down. To live beside such a treacherous neighbor—how could I bear it?”\n\nA man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe-thief; his expression—it was that of an axe-thief; his speech—it was that of an axe-thief; every movement and mannerism was unmistakably that of an axe-thief. Later, he dug in his grain pit and found his axe. When he saw his neighbor’s son again, none of his movements or mannerisms resembled an axe-thief.\n\nBai Gong Sheng was plotting rebellion. After court adjourned, he stood lost in thought, leaning on his scepter upside down. The metal tip pierced his chin, and blood flowed to the ground, yet he remained unaware. A man from Zheng heard of this and said: “If one can forget one’s own chin, what else might one forget?” When the mind is fixated, one may stumble over roots, collide with trees, and remain oblivious.\n\nOnce, a man from Qi coveted gold. Early one morning, he dressed in his finest and went to the market. Arriving at the gold-seller’s stall, he seized the gold and fled. The authorities caught him and asked: “With so many people around, why did you take someone else’s gold?” He replied: “When I took the gold, I saw no one—only the gold.”\n\n*Thus concludes the Lower Scroll of the* True Classic of Perfect Virtue and Emptiness.",
      "overlap_context": ", devouring each other in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. People take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Are mosquitoes and gnats not made to bite flesh, or tigers and wolves to eat meat? Was it Heaven’s design to create humans for mosquitoes and tigers, or meat for wolves?”\n\nIn Qi there was a poor man who often begged in the marketplace. The people of the marketplace, weary of his frequent appeals, refused to give him anything.",
