  "full_translation": "**The Mountain-Dwelling Daoist’s Practice of Cultivation and Refinement from the Three Caverns**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Mountain-Dwelling Daoist’s Practice of Cultivation and Refinement from the Three Caverns*\n**Volume:** One\n**Source Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One\n\n---\n\n### *The Mountain-Dwelling Daoist’s Practice of Cultivation and Refinement from the Three Caverns*\n#### **Chapter One: Qi-Absorption**\n\nAt the initial hour, present a petition to the celestial officials who oversee the qi. Upon completing the petition, perform qi-absorption, arranging incense and altar within the chamber.\n\nThe practitioner of qi-absorption stands facing due east, striking the chime nine times, and intones:\n\n*\"So-and-so (self) seeks the Dao of longevity and deathlessness. Today, I gather and absorb qi—eight draws, four draws, one hundred draws, refining the body’s qi one hundred and twenty times.*\n\n*As the sun rises in the east, illuminating the western ridge, may the celestial officials who govern qi, together with the twenty-four qi-officers and soldiers within my body, unite to welcome and guide the vital qi forward, entering into my form.*\n\n*The qi of eight draws—eight times eight, sixty-four breaths—descends through my pass and enters below.*\n*The qi of four draws—four times eight, thirty-two breaths—follows in succession through the pass and enters below.*\n*The qi of one draw—three times eight, twenty-four breaths—continues in succession through the pass and enters below.*\n\n*It courses to the Great Granary, opening and piercing the palaces and bureaus, unobstructing the limbs and joints. The qi fills and fulfills, banishing hunger and thirst, harmonizing the Five Viscera, prolonging years and augmenting lifespan, attaining longevity and ascending as a flying immortal, uniting in virtue with the divine luminaries.*\n\n*How joyous! The Great Dao’s pure song—now raise the voice and strike the chime in succession.\"*\n\nOnce the continuous recitation is complete, proceed to the bed, disrobe, and lie bare beneath a warm, thick coverlet. The pillow is raised four inches high; the hair is loosened, and one lies supine with head upright. The feet are spaced one foot apart, and the hands are positioned in the same manner.\n\nGrasp firmly with the mind, visualize the received names and taboo names of the Six Jia spirits and their parents. Next, contemplate the deities of the Mud-Pill Palace and the Cinnabar Field. Then inhale the vital qi through the nose and exhale the dead qi through the mouth. Initially, inhale three times and exhale once. After practice and adjustment, increase to one, three, five, seven, and nine inhalations, exhaling after twelve breaths. Thus, the balanced qi becomes fully sufficient. With prolonged and extensive practice, increase to five, twenty-four, seven, and thirty.\n\nFirst, draw in the eight-breath qi—eight times eight, sixty-four breaths—then again draw in the four-breath qi—four times eight, thirty-two breaths—and once more draw in the one-breath qi—three times eight, twenty-four breaths—until the total of one hundred twenty refining breaths for harmonizing the body is complete. Gently harmonize the qi and close the breath, refining the long breath to a full three hundred sixty cycles. If able to reach one thousand two hundred, prolonged closure without breathing is even better. Once the breath count is complete, exhale fully through the mouth. If the breath feels obstructed, immediately inhale and swallow the qi. Do not swallow to excess; after three or four swallows, the qi will settle.\n\nThen, interlock the thumbs and raise both palms above the head, gazing upward toward the Great Clarity. Clench the big toes and hold for three times seven, then release the hands. Next, extend both hands straight upward and flip them two or three times. Then, interlock the thumbs, cross the elbows, and pull firmly, three times on each side. Next, grasp the left foot and rub the chest thirty-nine times. Then grasp the right foot and rub the chest thirty-nine times. Next, clasp both insteps, swiftly raise the body so the forehead touches the ground, holding for three counts. Return to a supine position, spacing the feet as in the qi-ingestion method. When the qi settles, let the spirit follow the qi’s ascent and descent. After one hundred twenty breaths, place both hands crossed over the heart and count nine times nine, eighty-one breaths. Next, cross the arms and raise the bent legs, counting twenty-one breaths, then twenty-five, then one nine, one seven, and one five.\n\nThen clasp the neck and move the bent knees back and forth three times seven, then lie down and turn as comfortable to nurture the qi. Next, rise and dress, arrange the incense and altar, and strike the chime nine times. Chant three times with a drawn-out voice:\n\n*\"This body of so-and-so has gathered and refined the eight-breath, four-breath, and one-breath qi, completing one full cycle of one hundred twenty refining breaths. Now, chanting and reciting will settle the qi and calm the spirit. The eight-breath qi—eight times eight, sixty-four breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, ascending from the pass and exiting. The four-breath qi—four times eight, thirty-two breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, ascending from the pass and exiting. The one-breath qi—three times eight, twenty-four breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, rising evenly, halting at the pass, then descending to the Great Granary, guarding the palaces and bureaus, pacifying the Five Viscera, harmonizing the mechanisms, unblocking the hundred vessels, expelling the Three Corpses, curing illnesses, prolonging years and augmenting life, attaining long life and enduring longevity. The Great Dao, in its compassion, oversees this. May the deities of the canonical qi witness and bring this to fruition, granting so-and-so clarity and luminous insight, communion with the divine spirits, ascent as a flying immortal, and the profound grace of the Dao. Joyous is this long song!\"*\n\nThen rise and walk in an open space, pacing five hundred steps—more if possible. At midday, when hunger returns, repeat the method as before. One hundred twenty breaths complete one year’s cycle. In the second year, take two hundred forty breaths in one session. After three years, take three hundred sixty breaths in one session. At midday, if able, repeat the intake as before. After four years, increase as much as beneficial, or until satiation. Carefully and diligently practice this.\n\nWhen the qi-ingestion method completes three thousand six hundred great cycles of the body’s work, there is a grand method of guiding and chanting with dance. Strike the chime and chant:\n\n*\"This body of so-and-so, ingesting qi and refining form, seeks the Dao of long life and immortality. Gathering and refining the eight-breath, four-breath, and one-breath qi, completing one full cycle of the body, the count now reaches three thousand six hundred great cycles. With the work complete, chant, sing, and dance to guide and refine the sinews and bones, seeking immortal longevity. May the officials of the canonical qi and guiding deities oversee and bring this to fruition, allowing so-and-so’s guiding and stretching to soften the sinews and bones without harming the body, refining and transforming flesh and bone to unite with the qi, filling the Five Viscera, achieving spiritual clarity and vision, and befriending immortals. Joyous is this dance and song!\"*\n\nThen raise the hands and dance three rounds, guiding once and dancing once. The guiding method is transmitted orally and practiced accordingly. Carefully and diligently follow this.\n\nThe method of ingesting qi to seek long life requires abstaining from speech, closing the breath, and maintaining silence, avoiding worldly affairs. Immortality is not achieved in haste. Reduce the intake of grains, fruits, and dates; after midday, eat sparingly. In the first year, consume two *dou* of rice; in the second year, one *dou*; in the third year, five *sheng*. Regularly eat nine dried dates daily and one *sheng* of dark water. Eat one *sheng* of mixed cooked vegetables daily. Avoid slippery vegetables to strengthen qi and vitality, enabling guiding, stretching, movement, and self-nurturance. After three years of qi regulation, grains may be entirely cut off—this is the refined method of qi ingestion. For intermediate practitioners, grains may be cut off after one or two years. For beginners, after one hundred days. If ingesting qi and taking medicinal herbs, grains may be cut off immediately—this is the highest and best method.\n\nThe method of ingesting qi should be subtle and refined, ensuring no sound of breath entering or leaving is heard by the ears.\n\nThe method of ingesting qi involves regularly holding a date pit in the mouth to rinse the Flower Pool, thoroughly irrigating the five viscera as a constant practice—this must be observed with clarity and caution. The coarse method of ingesting qi is used to treat illnesses. When eating rice, reduce intake by one mouthful each day, and grains may be entirely cut off after ten days. When ingesting qi, cease upon feeling sated, and all ailments will be dispelled.\n\nDuring the initial stage of refining qi with closed breath, one should mentally invoke the names of the Six Jia True Parents, followed by visualizing the deities of the Three Primordial Cinnabar Fields. The upper one resides in the Mud Pill Palace, three inches inward between the eyebrows—this is the Upper Primordial Cinnabar Field’s True Person, the Red Child, styled Yuanxian, also named Diqing. The heart is the Crimson Palace Middle Cinnabar Field, home to the Middle Primordial True Person, styled Zidan, also named Guangjian. Three inches below the navel lies the Lower Primordial Cinnabar Field’s True Person, the Infant, styled Yuanyangzi, also named Guxuan. These Three Ones are the Three Cinnabar Fields—this must be observed with clarity and caution.\n\nFor those who ingest qi yet remain bound by worldly ties, their aspirations unfulfilled while dwelling at home, serving in office, or traveling, unable to cultivate in quiet solitude, they may practice the methods of this world. Through virtuous conduct and accomplishment, they may combine grain regulation with qi refinement, and further incorporate the Six Jia Talismans from Xianmenzi’s *Zhongdun*, which are highly beneficial. When defiled, these talismans can dispel illness, regulate the five viscera, and prevent malevolent forces from harming the practitioner, thus averting disasters and misfortunes.\n\nThe secret method of ingesting qi involves fasting from dusk until dawn, allowing grain qi to dissipate completely, leaving the five viscera empty and qi harmonized. From sunrise to midday on clear days, face the sun to absorb qi, whether sitting or lying down. Begin with a small amount, taking the Twenty-Four Qi, then gradually increase to Thirty-Two Qi for regulation. Further progress to Sixty-Four Qi, then practice until mastering One Hundred Twenty Qi—proceed only when able, otherwise cease. Maintain this practice without fail through the seasons, days, and hours, ensuring the qi pathways remain unobstructed. The quantity may be adjusted as desired, and combining this with medicinal herbs is even better.\n\nOne should constantly visualize the spirits, recite incantations, and practice guiding and stretching exercises. Thus, heavenly spirits will inscribe one’s heart, recording merits and efficacy. Combining grain abstention with these practices opens the path to communion with the divine, enabling the cultivation of virtue, the Dao, and refined contemplation. When withdrawing from worldly affairs, observe this with clarity and caution. Once qi refinement is mastered, hunger and thirst will no longer arise.\n\nDrinking dark water aids qi, but consuming more than one *dou* disrupts the qi pathways, while drinking ordinary water obstructs the qi meridians. After obtaining qi, drink only date water: take ten fine large dates, boil them thoroughly, remove the skins, strain the juice, and reduce it to three *sheng*. Drink this regularly when thirsty. On days when dates are eaten, boil ten; if hungry, up to twenty or thirty may be consumed, but if not hungry, refrain. Make drinking water a habit, but do not consume excessively, and never drink cold water—always boil it first.\n\nFor those living in the worldly realm of office and labor while practicing qi refinement, avoid all blood, meat, raw vegetables, pungent herbs, and unripe fruits. Consume only well-cooked foods, and eat sparingly—this must be observed with clarity and caution.\n\n**Section Two: Transmission of the Essential Methods of the Qi-Ingestion Scripture**\n\nThe master, [name and style], hereby transmits in this prefecture, county, township, and village to the disciple [name], the essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture*. You must observe and practice this diligently, adhering strictly to the scripture’s precepts and the commands of the covenant, as if under the statutes of the Most High Dao and the Lord Lao.\n\nOn the first day of the [year, month], the disciple [name], of [prefecture, county, township, village], aged [number] years, solemnly swears before the master: \"I humbly receive the master’s essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture* and its regulations. I dare not violate these commands. Should I transmit this to unworthy recipients, may I suffer the punishment of the Exchanged Blades Decree.\"\n\nThe master’s decree and the disciple’s oath, along with the scripture, are received together. The recipient performs eight bows upon submitting the memorial. After the master reads the decree to the disciple, the scripture is transmitted, and the disciple drinks the cinnabar water, then performs eight bows again. The oath is read aloud, the Exchanged Blades ritual is completed, and the disciple performs eight final bows to conclude.\n\nFor those of virtuous discipline bound by worldly ties, practicing medicinal grain abstention, qi ingestion, solar essence absorption, and the Six Wu Qi methods, there are oral transmissions that must be received directly from a master. These three methods each contain several sub-methods, which are not recorded in writing. The above is a summary of the covenant’s commands.\n\nRespectfully submitting this document, your disciple [prefecture, county, township, village], [male/female official, name], aged [number] years, delights in immortality and longevity, wears talismans and observes precepts, never transgressing the regulations. Through virtuous conduct and accomplishment, I seek to receive the secret essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture*.\n\nI, [name], prostrate myself in utmost sincerity, respectfully following the statutes to submit this memorial, tying the cord of the covenant, exchanging the blade, and drinking the cinnabar water, as decreed by the ritual. I swear that if I violate the precepts or transmit this to unworthy recipients, I shall suffer the calamity of the Exchanged Blades, as the decree commands.\n\nI humbly request that the officials in charge transmit this document and dispatch the covenant deities and the local earth gods to oversee this oath. I await their response with reverence.\n\nYour disciple [name], with awe and trepidation, respectfully submits this.\n\n**Section Three: Ritual for Receiving the Qi-Ingestion Method**\n\nRespectfully submitting this document, your disciple [prefecture, county, township, village], [male/female official, name], aged [number] years.\n\nI, [name], observe the talismanic precepts and have accomplished virtuous conduct. Having previously received the methods of wearing and ingesting qi, I delight in the Primordial Qi. Today, under an auspicious day and hour, with the heavens and earth clear and the vital qi harmonious, I submit this memorial to request the presence of the celestial officials and qi spirits to oversee this rite.\n\nWith my boundless devotion to the Primordial Qi, I humbly present this memorial in reverence, beseeching the custodians to transmit this document. May the celestial officials and the deities overseeing qi be graciously dispatched to witness and accomplish this rite, allowing me to gather and refine the Eight Extensions, Four Extensions, and One Extension—one hundred and twenty refinements of the harmonious, pure qi—into my body. May it flow through my palaces and chambers, tempering and transforming my sinews and bones, freeing me from hunger and thirst, and granting me long life and ascension. I implore this single favor with utmost devotion.\n\nYour disciple [name], with awe and trepidation, respectfully submits this.\n\n**Section Four: Ritual for Presenting a Memorial During Qi-Ingestion**\n\nRespectfully submitting this document, your disciple [name], aged [number] years, delights in the Dao of long life, longevity, and immortality.\n\nHaving studied under Master [name], I received the true registers, precepts, talismans, and covenants, accumulating years of practice without daring to violate the prohibitions. My virtuous conduct has borne fruit, and I have come to delight in the Primordial Qi. Previously, on [year, month, day], I was granted by my master the essential methods of qi-ingestion, including the *Hū-Ōng* breathing technique and the covenant of dynamic alignment, which I have since upheld and practiced. Today, under an auspicious day and hour, with the heavens and earth clear and the vital qi harmonious, I follow my master’s teachings and present this memorial in reverence. I beseech the custodians to transmit this document and entreat the celestial officials overseeing qi to descend and witness this accomplishment. May I gather and refine the Eight Extensions, Four Extensions, and One Extension—one hundred and twenty refinements of the harmonious, pure, and upright qi—into my body. May it flow through my palaces and chambers, tempering and transforming my sinews and bones, freeing me from hunger and thirst, and granting me long life and ascension. I humbly implore your mercy and await your gracious response.\n\n**Section Five: The Divine Method of the Golden Elixir**\n\nOne *jin* of golden essence,\nOne *jin* of five-colored *zhi* grasses,\nOne *jin* of five-colored jade essence.\n\nFive immortals refine the golden essence,\nFive jade maidens refine the five-colored *zhi* grasses.\nBoil them in a golden cauldron for seven days until the elixir is complete.\nObserve a hundred days of purification and abstinence.\nCombine the ingredients on the *yín* day of the second month,\nConsume it on the *wù-yín* day.\nAt sunrise during the *mǎo* hour, face east toward the sun and bow eight times.\nThen, with head tilted back, swallow one pill the size of a chicken’s yolk.\nYou will ascend to heaven and enter the Purple Palace,\nWhere the Five Emperors of Heaven will descend to welcome you.\n\nThe golden essence is the white ring above the lungs.\nThe jade essence is the qi within the throat’s nodal structure.\nThe blue *zhi* is the nine apertures of the liver’s vessels.\nThe red *zhi* is the nine apertures of the heart’s vessels.\nThe white *zhi* is the nine apertures of the lungs’ vessels.\nThe black *zhi* is the nine apertures of the kidneys’ vessels.\nThe yellow *zhi* is the nine apertures of the spleen’s vessels.\nThe golden elixir is the qi upon the tongue.\nThe golden cauldron is the central yellow qi.\nThe five immortals are *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *wù*, *gēng*, and *rén*.\nThe five jade maidens are *yǐ*, *dīng*, *jǐ*, *xīn*, and *guǐ*.\n\nThose who can preserve this will ascend as an entire household.\nIf the Son of Heaven consumes it, the nation will prosper in clarity.\nThe five pestilential diseases and the three ghosts will be subdued,\nHiding and ceasing their activity.\nWeapons and armor will rest,\nThe people will flourish in joy,\nThe ruler will impose no taxes,\nThe subjects will make no tribute.\nGrasses and trees will luxuriate in moisture—\nHow much more so for those who compound the elixir?\n\nA single pill of the golden elixir, weighing one *jin*,\nIs heavier than heaven, earth, and the mountains.\nWhat thing could compare?\n\nHuá-gài-zǐ asked Yù-zǐ, “Do people not say that heaven and earth have nine layers?”\n\nYù-zǐ laughed and said, “How could there be nine heavens above? I have traversed the mortal realm, recording good and gathering evil, seeking the worthy. By night, I roam above the nine heavens and descend below the nine earths. Heaven has nine stars, hence it is called the nine heavens. Earth has nine palaces, hence it is called the nine earths. Humans have nine apertures, hence they are called the nine orifices. The Northern Dipper has nine stars, two of which are hidden in the yin. Humans have nine apertures, two of which are concealed in the yin. The *Kuí-gāng*, also called the *Xuán-jī*, governs the myriad spirits and extends to the eight directions. Heaven is high, and humans follow its course. Those who know the *Kuí-gāng* are born alongside heaven and earth, shine with the sun and moon, transform in the indistinct, and ascend into the Great Clarity. I say to you: your kingdom can become a model for ten thousand generations.”\n\nYù-zǐ said: Above are the nine heavens, below are the nine earths. Above are the nine stars, below are the nine palaces.\n\nThus:\nThe Wood Sovereign of the East is called the Azure Heaven, governing warmth and generating the myriad things.\nThe Fire Sovereign of the South is called the Vermilion Heaven, governing heat and nurturing the myriad things.\nThe Metal Sovereign of the West is called the Bright Heaven, governing coolness and maturing the myriad things.\nThe Water Sovereign of the North is called the Dark Heaven, governing cold and killing the myriad things.\nThe Earth Sovereign of the Center is called the Round Heaven, governing wind.\nThe Northwest, being the highest, is called the Lofty Heaven, governing clarity.\nThe Southeast is called the Primordial Heaven, governing qi.\nThe Southwest is called the Cool Heaven, governing yin.\nThe Northeast is called the August Heaven, governing governance.\n\nThe lords of the nine heavens are collectively called the August Heaven.\n\nYù-zǐ said:\nThe first of the nine lords is the Supreme Sovereign, called the Lofty Heaven, governing clarity and the primordial qi of the mysterious origin. It cherishes and nurtures perfected ones, sages, and Daoists, hence its title: *August Heaven, Supreme Emperor, Great One, Dao Lord*.\nThe second is the North Culmen Lord, called the True Heaven, governing the eight winds and the commands of emperors and kings, hence its title: *August Heaven, Supreme Emperor, Controller of the Myriad Things*.\nThe third is the Clear Yang Lord, called the Azure Heaven, governing the blue and generating the myriad things, recording perfected ones.\nThe fourth is the Great Yang Lord, called the Flaming Heaven, governing heat and nurturing the myriad things.\nThe fifth is the Primordial Lord, called the Cool Heaven, governing perfected ones and immortals, ripening the myriad things.\nThe sixth is the Lesser Yang Lord, called the Bright Heaven, governing the maturation of the myriad things.\nThe seventh is the Great Yin Lord, called the Dark Heaven, governing cold and killing the myriad things.\nThe eighth is the Opening Heaven Lord, called the Lofty Heaven, governing calamities and transformations.\nThe ninth is the Yang Lord, called the Primordial Heaven, governing qi, creating clouds, rain, and lightning, commanding the myriad spirits. The Mysterious Master universally receives them, teaching me the three-five-step guiding principles.\n\nThose who seek shall attain their desires; those who earnestly seek the Dao shall attain the Dao, ascending as Immortal Kings. They shall pass through the Mysterious Gate, enjoying peace, longevity, and bliss, attaining high rank and illustrious position, their gold and purple radiant. They shall gain wealth as sought, jade and silk filling their halls. The desires of their hearts shall manifest without seeking, their wishes fulfilled without pursuit. They shall ride boats and chariots, command the Three Luminaries, women becoming noblewomen, men becoming marquises and kings. Like soaring immortals, even the young shall ascend high, treading the Dipper, not merely stepping upon the firmament.\n\nThe Three Officials and Six Records are also called the Three Commands, the Three Lives, the Three Treasures, and the Six Harms. Mysterious qi forms my fence, primordial qi my dwelling, and initial qi my bed and mat. Heaven, as the pure and clear mysterious qi, descends from above my head, enters my abode, and rests in my liver, piercing the Nine Heavens and emerging through my two eyes. Water, as the true white primordial qi, enters my abode from beneath my left and right pulses, rests in my lungs, pierces the Nine Heavens, and emerges through my two nostrils. Earth, as the true yellow initial qi, enters my abode from beneath my left and right feet, rests in my spleen, pierces the Nine Heavens, and emerges through my mouth. May these three qi converge, enveloping my body, year after year without end.\n\nNext, visualize the twenty-seven Lords of Vital Qi within the human body: the hair as the Azure City Lord, the head as the Three Terraces Lord, the brows as the Eight Poles Lord, the two ears as the Decisive Brightness Lords, the left eye as the Mysterious Brightness Lord, the right eye as the Primordial Brightness Lord, the nose as the Wondrous Gate of the Celestial Circuit Lord, the mouth as the Arrayed Primordial Jade Gate Lord, the teeth as the Eight Kings Lords, the tongue as the Boundless Lord, the throat as the Commandant Lord, the larynx as the Nine Ministers Lord, the liver as the Crimson Palace Lord, the lungs as the Florid Canopy Lord, the gallbladder as the Longevity Lord, the heart as the Cinnabar Prime Lord, the navel as the Purple-White Lord, the spleen as the Yellow Court Lord, the stomach as the Great Granary Lord, the large intestine as the Nourishing Mother Lord, the small intestine as the Guiding and Conducting Lord, the left kidney as the Mysterious Wondrous Lord, the right kidney as the Mysterious Primordial Lord, the intestines as the Transcendent Way Lord, the Triple Burner as the Mysterious Elder Lord, the two knees as the Little Chariot Lingering Lords, and the two feet as the Thunder, Lightning, and Cloud Qi Lords. May the Lion seize these twenty-seven vital qi and keep them within its body, never to depart recklessly.\n\nNext, visualize the Three Lords of the Red Child within the Lion’s body: for me, they reside in the Mud Pill, moving through the Crimson Palace and Cinnabar Field, never to depart recklessly. The Perfected One, styled Zidan, governs the human heart and presides over the myriad spirits for eternal life. The Red Child, styled Taishang, governs the human head and presides over longevity and life extension, restraining spirits from desires, embodying effortless action, and illuminating the completion of thirty thousand affairs.\n\nThe Upper One resides in the human brain—its spirit is the Red Child. The Middle One resides in the human heart—its spirit is the Perfected One. The Lower One resides three inches below the human navel—its spirit is the Infant. The Dao of human life arises entirely from these; ceaseless contemplation shall reveal the spirits. The brain is the Purple Tenuity Palace, the heart the Grotto Chamber Palace, and three inches below the navel the Cinnabar Field Palace. By constantly contemplating the qi of the spirits within these Three Palaces, one may attain longevity and enduring vision.\n\nNext, contemplate the Five Palaces within the human body. The six bowels and five viscera: the liver as the Wood Palace, the heart as the Fire Palace, the lungs as the Metal Palace, the kidneys as the Water Palace, and the spleen as the Earth Palace—these are also the five viscera. The liver is the Left General’s Prefecture, the lungs the Right General’s Prefecture, the heart the Front General’s Prefecture, the kidneys the Rear General’s Prefecture, the navel the Central Cavalry Great General’s Prefecture, and the head the Supreme General’s Prefecture.\n\nHe who knows the internal perceives the external. Knowing the five phases and six bowels within, the five viscera and five phases: the liver as Wood, the heart as Fire, the lungs as Metal, the kidneys as Water, and the spleen as Earth—these are the five viscera. The lungs as the Jade Hall Palace and the Ministry of Works Prefecture, the heart as the Crimson Hall Palace and the Primordial Yang Prefecture, the liver as the Clear and Cool Palace and the Orchid Terrace Prefecture, the gallbladder as the Purple Tenuity Palace and the Primordial Ultimate Prefecture, the kidneys as the Secluded Pasture Palace and the Supreme Harmony Prefecture, the spleen as the Central Yellow Palace and the Supreme Simplicity Prefecture—these are the six bowels. The lungs store the corporeal soul, the liver stores the ethereal soul, the heart stores the spirit, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will—these are the five viscera.\n\nThe five phases: in heaven as the five stars, on earth as the five phases, in humans as the five viscera, and in color as the five hues. In heaven as the five stars: Jupiter in the east, Mars in the south, Venus in the west, Mercury in the north, and Saturn in the center. On earth as the five phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In humans as the five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. In color as the five hues: azure, red, white, black, and yellow.\n\nAs for the intermediate colors: Jia and Ji as wife and husband, yellow entering azure becomes green; Bing and Xin as wife and husband, white entering red becomes crimson; Ding and Ren as wife and husband, red entering black becomes purple; Wu and Gui as wife and husband, black entering yellow becomes dark blue. Thus, the intermediate colors arise: Jia as Wood, Yi as Forest, Bing as Fire, Ding as Ash, Wu as Earth, Ji as Ochre, Geng as Metal, Xin as Ore, Ren as Water, and Gui as Mud.\n\nWood qi has its generation, Fire qi its growth, Metal qi its killing, and Water qi its extinction. How is this known? Wood qi has its generation: in the three months of spring, all sprouts cluster forth from the earth—thus Wood qi has its generation. In the three months of summer, all things grow to maturity—thus Fire qi has its growth.\n\nIn the three months of autumn, all things die—thus Metal qi has its killing. In the three months of winter, all creatures that stir lie buried, unable to fly or flee—thus Water qi has its concealment and extinction.\n\nWood qi has its generation: Yi is the wife of Geng, thus it envelops Metal qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns elm into green beans—hence named the Azure Grain of the East.\n\nFire qi has its growth: Ding is the wife of Ren, thus it envelops Water qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns mulberry into wheat—hence named the Cinnabar Grain of the South.\n\nEarth qi has its nurturing: Ji is the wife of Jia, thus it envelops Wood qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns melon into millet—hence named the Central □ Grain.\n\nMetal qi has its killing: Xin is the wife of Bing, thus it envelops Fire qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns jujube into rice—hence named the White Grain of the West.\n\nWater qi has its concealment: Gui is the wife of Wu, thus it envelops Earth qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns tangerine into soybeans—hence named the Dark Grain of the North.\n\nWhy do the Five Phases alternate as husband and wife? What is the reason for these pairings?\nWhen Earth desires to travel east, Wood goes to restrain it—thus Wu marries Ji as Jia’s wife.\nWhen Wood desires to travel west, Metal goes to fell it—thus Jia marries Yi as Geng’s wife.\nWhen Metal desires to travel south, Fire goes to slay it—thus Geng marries Xin as Bing’s wife.\nWhen Fire desires to travel north, Water douses and extinguishes it—thus Bing marries Ding as Ren’s wife.\nWhen Water desires to travel south, Earth goes to drain it—thus Ren marries Gui as Wu’s wife.\nThus the nature of wives is known.\n\nWhy do the Five Phases mutually punish and destroy, leading to death?\nWhy does Wood piercing Earth not destroy it? Why does Fire burning Metal not destroy it?\nWood and Fire are both Yang qi, inclined toward generation and not killing. Metal felling Wood causes death; Water dousing Fire causes death—both are due to Yin qi’s greed, and all such punishments result in death.\n\nThe Five Phases correspond to the five viscera: the heart to the Fire Phase, the liver to the Wood Phase, the lungs to the Metal Phase, the kidneys to the Water Phase, and the spleen to the Earth Phase.\n\nThe five viscera follow the Five Phases: the liver belongs to Wood, yet why does it sink when it receives Water?\nBecause it is Jia’s wife and receives Earth qi, causing it to sink.\n\nThe lungs belong to Metal, yet why do they float when they receive Water?\nBecause Xin is Bing’s wife and receives Fire qi, causing them to float.\n\nThe spleen belongs to Earth and cannot reside in the center when it receives Water.\nGui is Wu’s wife, and Earth is the center of the Five Phases—Gui stirs Earth.\nThus, when the spleen receives Water, it does not rise to the top nor sink to the bottom but remains precisely in the center.\n\nWhy is Gui Wu’s wife?\nEarth, in the midst of the Five Phases, is explained through this principle to harmonize the intent of the Five Phases.\n\nWood begins in Hai, flourishes in Mao, and dies in Wei and Hai. Mao is a Yin thief—no officials may be appointed, and no affairs are auspicious.\nWater begins in Shen, flourishes in Zi, and dies in Chen and Shen. Zi is the Greedy Wolf—it cannot be employed.\nChen is treacherous, Wei is perverse, Xu is upright, Chou is public—treachery, perversity, evil, public, and upright are distinguished.\n\n**Section on Cutting Off Grain: Authentic Cinnabar Elixir Recipe**\nUse three liang of white honey, half a jin of white wax, and three liang of authentic cinnabar. Combine these three ingredients.\nMelt the wax over fire, then add the cinnabar and honey. Heat and stir, performing nine upward and nine downward motions. When the medicine is ready, form pills the size of wu-tong seeds.\nTake one pill three times a day. It lightens the body, boosts qi, and allows one to go a full year without hunger. Prepare this in secret, ensuring no woman sees the process.\n\n**Longevity Elixir**\nIn the seventh month, gather two sheng of fully red paper mulberry fruit, dry in the shade, pound, and mix with water. Take a seven-fen spoonful. Over time, it enables one to see ghosts and perceive objects beneath the earth.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Cinnabar Longevity Elixir**\nTake three jin of cinnabar, grind finely, and sift through double-layered silk. Place in a bronze vessel, pour nine sheng of pure, strong vinegar over it, and stir until it resembles mud. Set in a warm place to dry. Repeat the process until one jin of cinnabar has absorbed three sheng of vinegar—then the medicine is ready. Dry it in the sun for thirty days. When it turns purple, stir it; if it does not stick to the hands when pulled, resembling malt sugar, it is ready. Form pills the size of sesame seeds. Take three pills daily with well-water, always in the morning.\n\nBefore taking the medicine, fast and purify for thirty days, bathing in a five-fragrance decoction. On the first day of ingestion, the three worms will be expelled. By the sixth day, all illnesses in the body will be cured. After sixty days, visions will appear. After one year, white hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow. After two years, one’s complexion reverts to that of a fifteen-year-old, and divine beings will come of their own accord.\n\nIncrease the dosage by one pill daily until reaching nine pills. After three years of ingestion, divine beings will appear, clad in purple and orchid robes, bearing trays of purple mushrooms and orchids to offer. Do not fear—calm your mind and steady your intent. All things will come naturally, and you will command a hundred ghosts and spirits, seeing them all.\n\nThe first spirit is named Shang, the second Shou, and the third Heng. These spirits can summon all things and call forth the names of a hundred ghosts, bringing them to you. You will be able to enter water, fire, wood, metal, stone, and earth—indeed, all places—without obstruction. Transformations will occur naturally, and you will see clearly for ten thousand li. The power of the Dao will flourish, and you will rise without effort. You will inwardly perceive the five viscera, becoming a True Person, recognized by all divine beings. You will traverse the hidden and obscure, achieving the perfection of the Dao. Your lifespan will extend to eighteen thousand years, and with continuous ingestion, it will be boundless.\n\nDrink only a little water. When preparing the elixir, you must fast and purify yourself. The elixir should be compounded before the Summer Solstice; do not ingest it after the Summer Solstice. The precepts forbid consuming blood, wine, meats, raw vegetables, and the like. This is not to be transmitted to the unworthy, lest calamity befall your descendants. The divine immortals’ secret formula is most excellent.\n\nThe Dao of cultivating perfection takes concentrated meditation, ingestion of talismans, guarding the spirit, and refining qi as its foundation. For all who refine qi, first ingest this talisman. After a year of grain avoidance, then transmit it to the worthy and enlightened, who will diligently follow the method as prescribed. The talisman is written in cinnabar.\n\nIngesting the first two talismans will leave you hungry after a hundred days; ingest this talisman to supplement them.\n\n**Right: Divine Talisman for Qi Ingestion and Grain Avoidance**\n\nAt dawn, use well-flower water or east-flowing water. Swallow six talismans daily, ingesting them all at once as a regular practice. Recite thus: \"The initial method of qi ingestion begins at the *mao* hour, the head facing *mao*; at the *chen* hour, face *chen*; at the *si* hour, face *si*; at the *wu* hour, face *wu*.\" From midday to the *hai* hour, these are the hours of dead qi; do not absorb qi then. Avoid strong winds, heavy rain, thunder, cold yin, and dark gloom. Await the clarity of heaven and earth and the rising of the sun before absorbing qi. If you absorb qi after the *si* and *wu* hours, yin qi will overpower yang, harming the five viscera. Ingesting qi will then be of no benefit. Be diligent and cautious in practice.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Talisman Grades**\n\n**Bian Que’s Talisman for Sudden Death**, issued by the Orthodox Unity Perfected Person. This talisman treats sudden affliction by evil, flying corpse entering the abdomen, acute pain, and lockjaw. Write it in cinnabar on water or on paper as a talisman. Form three pills and swallow them; if not cured, repeat until three full courses are completed. Write it on the area below the heart and the abdomen, inscribing it large—none will fail to recover.\n\n**Master Changsang’s Secret Talisman**\nThis talisman treats heart injury from malign influences, with loss of breath. Write it in cinnabar on white paper three times, place the three talismans into three cups of washing water, and ingest them in order from left to right. After three talismans, recovery follows.\n\nThis talisman treats sudden abdominal pain and distension, with qi on the verge of collapse, resembling a flying corpse. Write it in cinnabar on the patient’s abdomen, inscribing it large so it spans the entire length of the abdomen for best effect. It may also be ingested as a talisman.\n\nThese two talismans treat sudden encounters with evil, where a visiting ghost pierces the heart, causing pain and qi on the verge of collapse. Write them in cinnabar on white paper. First ingest the upper talisman; if the condition does not cease after a moment, ingest the lower talisman. If it still does not cease, begin again from the upper talisman. If the patient has died but warmth remains below the heart and slight movement is present, ingesting the talisman will still cure. If the mouth is locked and cannot be opened, break a tooth to insert the talisman; once it enters the mouth, it need not reach the stomach. Alternatively, insert the talisman into a scallion leaf. Insert it deeply into the nose, then push it further with water, shaking to ensure passage, and the patient will revive. This talisman is divinely efficacious.\n\n**Zhang Tianshi’s Account of Bian Que’s Formula for Instant Revival from Sudden Death**, originally bestowed upon the Lady of Southern Peak, is recorded here. When writing the talisman, first purify yourself with washing, then proceed facing the moon, holding your breath as you write. The method requires first outlining the perimeter in blue-black, then writing in cinnabar within. If blue and cinnabar are unavailable, ink may be used. For talismans treating demonic illness, grind tiger bone and true pearl together, then use the mixture to write the talisman.\n\n**The Great Plain Perfected Person’s Instruction to Lord Pei on Two Methods for Attaining Perfection:**\nAt the first light of dawn, face the rising sun, close your eyes, and hold your breath for ten cycles. Then swallow the sunlight ten times, visualizing the sunlight entering your mouth and swallowing it. Next, visualize the Azure Emperor Lord descending with the sunlight to your left. Then visualize the Vermilion Emperor descending with the sunlight to your right. Next, visualize the White Emperor descending with the sunlight to your back. Then visualize the Black Emperor descending with the sunlight to your left hand. Finally, visualize the Yellow Emperor descending with the sunlight to your right hand. Once all Five Emperors have arrived, visualize a crimson cloud chariot of the sun-mirror, drawn by nine dragons, descending with the sunlight before you. Then, together with the Five Emperors, board the chariot and race toward the sun.\n\nLord Pei practiced concentrated meditation on a solitary mountain. Within a year, faint forms appeared. Within two years, the Five Emperors descended with the sun and manifested at his sides. Within three years, they conversed and laughed with him all day. Within five years, the Five Emperors and the Sun Lord shared a flying dragon chariot with Lord Pei, traveling east to the Celestial Cavern of the Sun, the Eastern Palace of the Great Chariot, the City of the Eight Poles, ascending the Terrace of Illuminated Perfection, and sitting in the Hall of Sparse Forests. There, they bestowed upon Lord Pei the *Chapter for Commanding Spirits* and the *Talisman of the Nine Possessions*. He consumed the Azure Essence of the Sun’s Radiance and drank the Cloudy Azure Profound Nectar. Thereafter, he roamed daily with the Five Emperors and the Sun Lord—this is the so-called *Way of Racing the Sun*.\n\nWithin the sun, there are also Five Emperors. The first is the Sun Lord. The *Central Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* states: \"If you wish to become a Perfected Person, visualize the Sun Lord harnessing a vermilion phoenix, riding the celestial radiant clouds, and journeying east to the Sparse Forests. Enter the Gate of Perfection through concentrated meditation, and you will obtain the essential Dao, named *Upper Clarity Spirit*. You will be ranked among the Perfected Officials, wielding the *Writings of Yu Yi*—these are the two methods for attaining perfection.\"\n\nAt dusk, face the moon, close your eyes, and hold your breath for nine cycles. Then swallow the moonlight nine times, visualizing the moonlight entering your mouth and swallowing it. Next, visualize the Azure Empress descending with the moonlight to your left. Then visualize the Vermilion Empress descending with the moonlight to your right. Next, visualize the White Empress descending with the moonlight to your back. Then visualize the Black Empress descending with the moonlight to your left hand. Finally, visualize the Yellow Empress descending with the moonlight to your right hand.\n\nThe Five Empresses all arrive, and you then visualize the *Flowing Spirit Flying Cloud Chariot*, drawn by ten dragons, descending with the moonlight before you. You further visualize the Five Empresses riding together with you toward the moon.\n\nMaster Pei dwelled upon the empty mountain, cultivating practice and refining contemplation. Within one year, he vaguely perceived their forms. Within two years, the Five Empresses all appeared in their lunar aspects, standing to his left and right, laughing and rejoicing together. Within five years, the Five Empresses of the Moon accompanied him in the flying dragon chariot, journeying west to the *Gate of Six Ridges*, the *Mound of Eight Endings*, the *Palace of Harmonious Dawn*, and the *City of Eight Sceneries*. They ascended the *Terrace of Seven Spirits*, sat in the *Hall of Great Harmony*, and bestowed upon Master Pei the *Flowing Star Night-Shining Writ*, the *Talisman of Ten Luminances*, the *Yellow-Purple Essence of Divine Nectar*, and the *Moonflower Cloud-Cream*. Thus, he roamed with the Five Empresses every evening—this is called the *Way of Rushing to the Moon*.\n\nWithin the moon, there are also Five Empresses. The *Outer Scripture* states: \"The Lady of the Sun Lord is the Sovereign of Sun and Moon.\" The *Middle Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* says: \"If you wish to ascend to heaven, visualize the Moon Empress, harness ten flying dragons, and ride my *Flowing Spirit* westward to the *Six Ridges*, then enter the *Imperial Hall* in refined contemplation to behold the *Celestial August Emperor of the Upper Heaven*, where you will wield the *Writings of Jeweled Patterns*.\"\n\nMaster Pei said: \"In refined contemplation, face the sun and visualize the Five Lords of the Sun within it. At night, face the moon in refined contemplation and visualize the Five Empresses of the Moon within it. Within five years, the spirits of sun and moon will both arrive, and together you will ride the flying dragons to roam the *Great Mystery*. At the beginning of study, the Five Spirits will manifest their forms, bestow scriptures, and grant divine mushrooms. Upon completion of cultivation, the Five Lords and Empresses of Sun and Moon will harness the reins of purity and emptiness, riding the *Great Cinnabar* clouds to pay homage at the *Three Origins*, bowing before the *Golden Gates*. Then you will obtain the *Jade Spirit* and *Golden Perfection*, wielding authority over all spirits. Jade maidens and jade lads will attend you day and night, receiving scriptures to become Perfected. You will be granted the *Tiger Talisman of the False Spirit* to command the *Six Heavens of Severity*; the *Flowing Gold Bell* to summon all essences; and the *Azure-Furred Staff* to traverse the *Nine Palaces*. All this arises from refined contemplation of the subtle and mysterious, profoundly moving the heart of heaven, thus causing spirits to descend upon your body and ascend to the *Imperial Court*.\"\n\nThis is the practice of the Daoist adept—it is not necessary to already be an immortal. When Master Pei secluded himself in a hidden chamber where sun and moon were not visible, he merely visualized and contemplated them in his heart, without needing to see the sun or moon. The essential point is to gaze upon them when visible, direct your will single-mindedly, refine your contemplation to its utmost, and there will be nothing you cannot penetrate. This is the crucial teaching.\n\nFirst visualize the Five Stars within your body. When the heart is fixed upon the Dao, the true spirits are also complete, reflecting your intent. If great difficulties have not yet been overcome, feign humility while inwardly storing truth, and though you may not yet turn back the years, in the *Western Elm’s* time, the *Mysterious Youth* will reemerge. The *Mysterious One* is steadfast; the will is diligent. Even if your strength wanes, your face wrinkles, and white hair grows upon your crown, my Dao can transform you into an infant in but a moment. It is only a question of the strength of your will—whether young or old in study, it matters not. I have gone before you; such a one is he.\n\nAnother method involves preparing a memorial: one foot and two inches in length, inscribed in cinnabar with the following text: \"[Your] prefecture, county, village, and personal name, desiring longevity, transcendence, and ascension to the immortals, to soar through the *Upper Clarity*, to become a true and divine person. [I beseech] the spirit lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Three Offices, and the Nine Bureaus to absolve my transgressions.\" After inscribing the memorial, bind it with a pair of gold rings using green silk thread. Bow twice facing north, place the memorial upon a stone, and burn it with fire until it is reduced to ashes. Then conceal the rings within a hidden crevice in the stone and depart without looking back. Alternatively, you may burn a pair of shoes as a substitute for the rings—ancients called these the *Leisurely Pearls*.\n\nIf envious and slanderous people steal them, such theft not only brings no benefit but may even hasten death. After ten such occurrences, the Five Lords of Heaven, the Three Offices, and the Nine Bureaus will issue successive decrees to absolve a person’s transgressions, inscribe their name among the immortals, and register their form in the celestial records. Entering the mountains to seek divine mushrooms and spirit herbs, all you seek will be obtained. Divine immortals and jade maidens will naturally come to protect and attend you.\n\nTigers, wolves, and all manner of harm dare not assail one. Divine immortals offer their protection and aid, ever desiring that mortals attain the Dao, opening their hearts and minds. Malevolent ghosts and ancient specters dare not test one’s resolve. Those who practice this Way do so with ease and without peril.\n\nShould a Daoist remain ignorant of this method, entering the mountains will bring frequent illness and misfortune, often being tested by ghostly entities. If dwelling among men, such a one will know only hardship, sickness, and unfulfilled desires. But those who walk this path shall attain long life and become divine immortals.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Prohibitions for Those Who Establish Resolve in Cultivating the Dao, Nurturing Spirit, and Seeking Immortality**\n\nThose who establish resolve in cultivating the Dao, nurturing spirit, and seeking immortality must bathe regularly to invite the descent of the numinous qi and the Jade Maidens. Without bathing, the divine qi will not come.\n\nDaoists must keep their mouths closed and refrain from speech. Those who speak of the Dao will be harmed by the Three Offices—this must be strictly guarded against. If one’s secret practices or words are revealed, a year is deducted from one’s lifespan.\n\nWhen engaging in deep meditation, one should first burn incense to the left and right. Daoists should dwell alone in a chamber, avoiding mingling with others. Even clothing and belongings must not be lent to others, lest inauspicious and impure qi intrude.\n\nThose of like mind are called \"fellow covenanters.\" One must avoid defilement and the sight of corpses, for these offend the true qi.\n\nConsuming mica powder while continuing carnal relations or eating blood-rich foods will not extend life but instead, over time, cause abscesses in the joints. When ingesting jade, one should also take realgar. Without it, prolonged use will generate internal heat, and if cold water is poured over the body as if dousing a withered plant, it may prove fatal.\n\nIngesting jade shards severs the union of yin and yang. When drinking jade nectar, one must drink cold water and avoid hot foods. All who consume jade must abstain from the Five Pungent Roots and blood-rich foods, or they cannot attain long life.\n\nThose who take herbal medicines yet eat pork will only worsen their ailments. Before consuming mica, one should first ingest sesame for a year. Without this, it will not harm but may be taken afterward.\n\nAll who consume realgar or the Eight Minerals must abstain from blood-rich foods. Otherwise, over time, they may suffer hemiplegia—beware, beware!\n\nTaking elixirs into defiled households or consuming meat and strong flavors will harm the practitioner. Daoists must universally observe these prohibitions.\n\nWhen consuming Solomon’s seal, avoid plums. When taking wood-based medicines, avoid peaches. When ingesting rehmannia, avoid large cuts of meat. When taking asparagus root, avoid carp.\n\n**Chapter Nine: On Entering Mountains to Gather Medicinal Substances, with Notes on Auspicious Days**\n\nWhen entering mountains for deep meditation, one must not hear the barking of dogs—beware, beware! All who enter mountains must empty their minds for a hundred days. Without this, they will be plagued by fear, encountering tigers, wolves, vipers, and serpents.\n\nTo gather the Eight Minerals in the mountains, lead a white dog and hold a white chicken, and you will find what you seek. When gathering mushrooms, do so when overcast and the sun is hidden, not when it shines.\n\nCarry a peck of white rice to facilitate your search. Two beans make one *daogui*, two *daogui* make one pinch, and two pinches make one square-inch spoon. For powdered or pelletized medicines, one square-inch spoon holds ten firmiana seeds.\n\n**Lord Lao’s Dragon-Riding Talisman:**\nTake five *jin* of cinnabar and three *jin* of mercury, grind the cinnabar into powder, and mix it with the mercury. Place it beneath the eastern eaves of a house where rainwater flows, then perform the Yu step and draw in qi to retrieve it after a hundred days. Add three *jin* of mica powder, steam it in a steamer for a day and a night until harmonized, then stir in one *sheng* of white honey. Seal the mouth tightly with wax and wrap it securely. On the day of *Lichun*, place it at the bottom of a well. On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, retrieve it. The elixir will resemble mercury. Take a dose the size of a square-inch spoon, three times daily, while maintaining a fast. One may then ascend and descend upon clouds without hindrance, attended by jade lads, traversing ten thousand *li* in an instant.\n\nWhen compounding this elixir, one must first purify through fasting and abstinence. Avoid funeral homes, defiled places, women, chickens, and dogs, lest one’s sincerity be compromised. This elixir enables divine transformation. Among the thousands of volumes on ingesting and consuming elixirs passed down through the ages, these eight methods are esteemed as the most wondrous secrets. Without regard to days or months, they allow mastery over all spirits, altering one’s appearance and form, merging with the divine in boundless transformation, ascending by day or vanishing into the earth, unconstrained by the Nine Classics.\n\nAll implements used in Daoist practices are offered to the Great One, while firewood is gathered only from auspicious sources. Those I have recently instructed have all achieved their desires. Even a small measure of this practice leads to immortality.\n\nOn the first day of the first month, the twenty-fifth day of the second month, the twentieth day of the third month, the sixteenth day of the fourth month, the eleventh day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the second day of the seventh month, the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, the twenty-first day of the ninth month, the sixteenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the sixth day of the twelfth month—these are the days when the Celestial Granary opens. One may enter the sacred mountains to gather auspicious herbs.\n\nOn the *zi* day of the first month, the *chou* day of the second month, the *yin* day of the third month, the *mao* day of the fourth month, the *chen* day of the fifth month, the *si* day of the sixth month, the *wu* day of the seventh month, the *wei* day of the eighth month, the *shen* day of the ninth month, the *you* day of the tenth month, the *xu* day of the eleventh month, and the *hai* day of the twelfth month—these are the days when the Earthly Granary opens. One may enter the sacred mountains for long-term residence, dwelling in safety without harm.\n\nFor Daoist methods of immortality, on the six *ding* days, bathe with the Five Fragrances to purify the body. On the six *ding* days, sweep the inner chambers, and one’s vision will extend a thousand *li*. After five years of practice, one may exit without obstruction and enter without hindrance, with every aperture connecting to the divine. One will not drown in water nor scorch in fire, floating perpetually among the clouds, traversing a thousand *li* in a single bound. Those who cultivate this may endure forever.\n\n**Chapter Ten: Various Methods for Expelling Parasites**\n\nTake a handful of the eastward-growing roots of *zhuyu* (medicinal evodia), cut off both ends, and brew with a *dou* of fine rice until fermented. Strain and discard the dregs. Fast overnight, then consume the brew the next morning on an empty stomach, and all parasites will be expelled through the stool.\n\nAnother method: Take a one-*chi*-long eastward-growing root of *zhuyu* and eight *sheng* of hemp seeds. Soak in eight *sheng* of dark water for one night, then strain and discard the dregs. Fast overnight, and consume the entire preparation the next morning—all corpse parasites will be expelled.\n\nAnother method: Take one *sheng* of *zhuyu*, pound and sift it clean. Soak in two *dou* of clear dark water for one night. Fast overnight, then strain and discard the dregs, consuming the liquid.\n\nConsume one *sheng*, and all parasites will be expelled, granting a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years.\n\nAnother method: Take one *sheng* of *wuyi* (elm seeds), grind to powder, and mix with one *sheng* of hemp seed juice. Fast overnight, then consume the entire preparation—all nine types of parasites will be expelled, granting a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years.\n\nAnother method: Take four *bozi* (cypress seeds), four *chi* (fermented soybeans), four peach kernels, and four *badou* (croton seeds). For all four ingredients, roast until yellow, then pound and sift. Mix with honey to form pills the size of hemp seeds. Children should take two pills, those of average constitution should take two pills the size of small beans, and adults should take three pills the size of large beans—millions of parasites will be expelled.\n\nAnother method: Take one *jin* of mulberry root bark, soak in dark water, and simmer over a low flame until reduced to three *sheng*. Strain and discard the dregs. Fast overnight, then consume one and a half *sheng*; if unable to tolerate it, take one *sheng*, and the parasites will be expelled. The following day, consume again, and parasites will surely be expelled. This method not only treats parasites but also cold conditions and other ailments. Even if the illness recurs over time, this remedy will prevent future outbreaks. Before taking the medicine, eat roasted jujubes, then consume the preparation to expel parasites—it strengthens the will and sharpens the eyes.\n\nA secret formula from *Huainan*: Use realgar powder mixed with *hundun* (chaotic primordial) white. Consume three pills the size of large beans, and one’s vision will extend a thousand *li*. When first entering the sacred mountains to seek seclusion and transcend the world, exit through the Celestial Treasury and enter the Earthly Gate. The six *gui* days are the Celestial Treasury, and the six *ji* days are the Earthly Gate. To align with the Dao and attain immortality, act at the hour of the Celestial Heart. When first entering the mountains to seek immortality, choose a day of the Celestial Heart—specifically, the *yin* day of the six *ji*. The hours of the Celestial Heart are *jisi*, *jimao*, *jichou*, *jihai*, *jiyou*, and *jiwei*. Begin your journey on such a day. When entering the sacred mountains, always use the *jiazi* day for opening and the *chu* day. Place five-inch squares of five-colored silk on a large stone, and your endeavors will surely succeed. At the outset, avoid the three *geng*, three *xin*, and three *ren*. The three *geng* refer to *geng* days, *geng* hours, and *geng* lands; the three *xin* and three *ren* follow the same pattern.\n\nMethod to enter mountains, forests, and wild marshes to repel snakes: Upon reaching the mountain’s base, inhale deeply once, then pluck a handful of grass from your left side with your left hand. Inhale again, place the grass in the path, and inhale once more while marking it with a stone. Then proceed without looking back. If accompanied by others, have them cross first. After they have passed, inhale once more and place the grass in their path. Each person should inhale once upon crossing, and once all have received the *qi*, proceed without looking back. After several hundred steps, you may move freely. Whether traveling ahead or behind, you will encounter snakes coiled like ropes and tigers turned to stone.\n\nThe Perfected One’s method for entering mountains: Hold a knife in the left hand—this is called *wogu* (clenched fist). Inhale thirty-eight breaths and exhale twenty-eight breaths, and nothing will be feared.\n\nTreatment for sudden parasitic poisoning with abdominal pain (caused by toads, tadpoles, or dung beetles): Take *qinyan* (swallow) droppings dissolved in water and consume two *qianbi*—this will induce vomiting of all parasites.\n\nThe *San Dong* Daoist mountain-dwelling cultivation protocols conclude here.",

Upon completing the petition, perform qi-absorption, arranging incense and altar within the chamber.\n\nThe practitioner of qi-absorption stands facing due east, striking the chime nine times, and intones:\n\n*\"So-and-so (self) seeks the Dao of longevity and deathlessness.

The Great Dao’s pure song—now raise the voice and strike the chime in succession.\"*\n\nOnce the continuous recitation is complete, proceed to the bed, disrobe, and lie bare beneath a warm, thick coverlet.

      "translated_text": "Grasp firmly with the mind, visualize the received names and taboo names of the Six Jia spirits and their parents. Next, contemplate the deities of the Mud-Pill Palace and the Cinnabar Field. Then inhale the vital qi through the nose and exhale the dead qi through the mouth. Initially, inhale three times and exhale once. After practice and adjustment, increase to one, three, five, seven, and nine inhalations, exhaling after twelve breaths. Thus, the balanced qi becomes fully sufficient. With prolonged and extensive practice, increase to five, twenty-four, seven, and thirty.\n\nFirst, draw in the eight-breath qi—eight times eight, sixty-four breaths—then again draw in the four-breath qi—four times eight, thirty-two breaths—and once more draw in the one-breath qi—three times eight, twenty-four breaths—until the total of one hundred twenty refining breaths for harmonizing the body is complete. Gently harmonize the qi and close the breath, refining the long breath to a full three hundred sixty cycles. If able to reach one thousand two hundred, prolonged closure without breathing is even better. Once the breath count is complete, exhale fully through the mouth. If the breath feels obstructed, immediately inhale and swallow the qi. Do not swallow to excess; after three or four swallows, the qi will settle.\n\nThen, interlock the thumbs and raise both palms above the head, gazing upward toward the Great Clarity. Clench the big toes and hold for three times seven, then release the hands. Next, extend both hands straight upward and flip them two or three times. Then, interlock the thumbs, cross the elbows, and pull firmly, three times on each side. Next, grasp the left foot and rub the chest thirty-nine times. Then grasp the right foot and rub the chest thirty-nine times. Next, clasp both insteps, swiftly raise the body so the forehead touches the ground, holding for three counts. Return to a supine position, spacing the feet as in the qi-ingestion method. When the qi settles, let the spirit follow the qi’s ascent and descent. After one hundred twenty breaths, place both hands crossed over the heart and count nine times nine, eighty-one breaths. Next, cross the arms and raise the bent legs, counting twenty-one breaths, then twenty-five, then one nine, one seven, and one five.\n\nThen clasp the neck and move the bent knees back and forth three times seven, then lie down and turn as comfortable to nurture the qi. Next, rise and dress, arrange the incense and altar, and strike the chime nine times. Chant three times with a drawn-out voice:\n\n*\"This body of so-and-so has gathered and refined the eight-breath, four-breath, and one-breath qi, completing one full cycle of one hundred twenty refining breaths. Now, chanting and reciting will settle the qi and calm the spirit. The eight-breath qi—eight times eight, sixty-four breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, ascending from the pass and exiting. The four-breath qi—four times eight, thirty-two breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, ascending from the pass and exiting. The one-breath qi—three times eight, twenty-four breaths—circulates through the palaces and bureaus, rising evenly, halting at the pass, then descending to the Great Granary, guarding the palaces and bureaus, pacifying the Five Viscera, harmonizing the mechanisms, unblocking the hundred vessels, expelling the Three Corpses, curing illnesses, prolonging years and augmenting life, attaining long life and enduring longevity. The Great Dao, in its compassion, oversees this. May the deities of the canonical qi witness and bring this to fruition, granting so-and-so clarity and luminous insight, communion with the divine spirits, ascent as a flying immortal, and the profound grace of the Dao. Joyous is this long song!\"*\n\nThen rise and walk in an open space, pacing five hundred steps—more if possible. At midday, when hunger returns, repeat the method as before. One hundred twenty breaths complete one year’s cycle. In the second year, take two hundred forty breaths in one session. After three years, take three hundred sixty breaths in one session. At midday, if able, repeat the intake as before. After four years, increase as much as beneficial, or until satiation. Carefully and diligently practice this.\n\nWhen the qi-ingestion method completes three thousand six hundred great cycles of the body’s work, there is a grand method of guiding and chanting with dance. Strike the chime and chant:\n\n*\"This body of so-and-so, ingesting qi and refining form, seeks the Dao of long life and immortality. Gathering and refining the eight-breath, four-breath, and one-breath qi, completing one full cycle of the body, the count now reaches three thousand six hundred great cycles. With the work complete, chant, sing, and dance to guide and refine the sinews and bones, seeking immortal longevity. May the officials of the canonical qi and guiding deities oversee and bring this to fruition, allowing so-and-so’s guiding and stretching to soften the sinews and bones without harming the body, refining and transforming flesh and bone to unite with the qi, filling the Five Viscera, achieving spiritual clarity and vision, and befriending immortals. Joyous is this dance and song!\"*\n\nThen raise the hands and dance three rounds, guiding once and dancing once. The guiding method is transmitted orally and practiced accordingly. Carefully and diligently follow this.\n\nThe method of ingesting qi to seek long life requires abstaining from speech, closing the breath, and maintaining silence, avoiding worldly affairs. Immortality is not achieved in haste. Reduce the intake of grains, fruits, and dates; after midday, eat sparingly. In the first year, consume two *dou* of rice; in the second year, one *dou*; in the third year, five *sheng*. Regularly eat nine dried dates daily and one *sheng* of dark water. Eat one *sheng* of mixed cooked vegetables daily. Avoid slippery vegetables to strengthen qi and vitality, enabling guiding, stretching, movement, and self-nurturance. After three years of qi regulation, grains may be entirely cut off—this is the refined method of qi ingestion. For intermediate practitioners, grains may be cut off after one or two years. For beginners, after one hundred days. If ingesting qi and taking medicinal herbs, grains may be cut off immediately—this is the highest and best method.\n\nThe method of ingesting qi should be subtle and refined, ensuring no sound of breath entering or leaving is heard by the ears.",

The pillow is raised four inches high; the hair is loosened, and one lies supine with head upright. The feet are spaced one foot apart, and the hands are positioned in the same manner.",

      "translated_text": "The method of ingesting qi involves regularly holding a date pit in the mouth to rinse the Flower Pool, thoroughly irrigating the five viscera as a constant practice—this must be observed with clarity and caution. The coarse method of ingesting qi is used to treat illnesses. When eating rice, reduce intake by one mouthful each day, and grains may be entirely cut off after ten days. When ingesting qi, cease upon feeling sated, and all ailments will be dispelled.\n\nDuring the initial stage of refining qi with closed breath, one should mentally invoke the names of the Six Jia True Parents, followed by visualizing the deities of the Three Primordial Cinnabar Fields. The upper one resides in the Mud Pill Palace, three inches inward between the eyebrows—this is the Upper Primordial Cinnabar Field’s True Person, the Red Child, styled Yuanxian, also named Diqing. The heart is the Crimson Palace Middle Cinnabar Field, home to the Middle Primordial True Person, styled Zidan, also named Guangjian. Three inches below the navel lies the Lower Primordial Cinnabar Field’s True Person, the Infant, styled Yuanyangzi, also named Guxuan. These Three Ones are the Three Cinnabar Fields—this must be observed with clarity and caution.\n\nFor those who ingest qi yet remain bound by worldly ties, their aspirations unfulfilled while dwelling at home, serving in office, or traveling, unable to cultivate in quiet solitude, they may practice the methods of this world. Through virtuous conduct and accomplishment, they may combine grain regulation with qi refinement, and further incorporate the Six Jia Talismans from Xianmenzi’s *Zhongdun*, which are highly beneficial. When defiled, these talismans can dispel illness, regulate the five viscera, and prevent malevolent forces from harming the practitioner, thus averting disasters and misfortunes.\n\nThe secret method of ingesting qi involves fasting from dusk until dawn, allowing grain qi to dissipate completely, leaving the five viscera empty and qi harmonized. From sunrise to midday on clear days, face the sun to absorb qi, whether sitting or lying down. Begin with a small amount, taking the Twenty-Four Qi, then gradually increase to Thirty-Two Qi for regulation. Further progress to Sixty-Four Qi, then practice until mastering One Hundred Twenty Qi—proceed only when able, otherwise cease. Maintain this practice without fail through the seasons, days, and hours, ensuring the qi pathways remain unobstructed. The quantity may be adjusted as desired, and combining this with medicinal herbs is even better.\n\nOne should constantly visualize the spirits, recite incantations, and practice guiding and stretching exercises. Thus, heavenly spirits will inscribe one’s heart, recording merits and efficacy. Combining grain abstention with these practices opens the path to communion with the divine, enabling the cultivation of virtue, the Dao, and refined contemplation. When withdrawing from worldly affairs, observe this with clarity and caution. Once qi refinement is mastered, hunger and thirst will no longer arise.\n\nDrinking dark water aids qi, but consuming more than one *dou* disrupts the qi pathways, while drinking ordinary water obstructs the qi meridians. After obtaining qi, drink only date water: take ten fine large dates, boil them thoroughly, remove the skins, strain the juice, and reduce it to three *sheng*. Drink this regularly when thirsty. On days when dates are eaten, boil ten; if hungry, up to twenty or thirty may be consumed, but if not hungry, refrain. Make drinking water a habit, but do not consume excessively, and never drink cold water—always boil it first.\n\nFor those living in the worldly realm of office and labor while practicing qi refinement, avoid all blood, meat, raw vegetables, pungent herbs, and unripe fruits. Consume only well-cooked foods, and eat sparingly—this must be observed with clarity and caution.\n\n**Section Two: Transmission of the Essential Methods of the Qi-Ingestion Scripture**\n\nThe master, [name and style], hereby transmits in this prefecture, county, township, and village to the disciple [name], the essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture*. You must observe and practice this diligently, adhering strictly to the scripture’s precepts and the commands of the covenant, as if under the statutes of the Most High Dao and the Lord Lao.\n\nOn the first day of the [year, month], the disciple [name], of [prefecture, county, township, village], aged [number] years, solemnly swears before the master: \"I humbly receive the master’s essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture* and its regulations. I dare not violate these commands. Should I transmit this to unworthy recipients, may I suffer the punishment of the Exchanged Blades Decree.\"\n\nThe master’s decree and the disciple’s oath, along with the scripture, are received together. The recipient performs eight bows upon submitting the memorial. After the master reads the decree to the disciple, the scripture is transmitted, and the disciple drinks the cinnabar water, then performs eight bows again. The oath is read aloud, the Exchanged Blades ritual is completed, and the disciple performs eight final bows to conclude.\n\nFor those of virtuous discipline bound by worldly ties, practicing medicinal grain abstention, qi ingestion, solar essence absorption, and the Six Wu Qi methods, there are oral transmissions that must be received directly from a master. These three methods each contain several sub-methods, which are not recorded in writing. The above is a summary of the covenant’s commands.\n\nRespectfully submitting this document, your disciple [prefecture, county, township, village], [male/female official, name], aged [number] years, delights in immortality and longevity, wears talismans and observes precepts, never transgressing the regulations. Through virtuous conduct and accomplishment, I seek to receive the secret essential methods of the *Qi-Ingestion Scripture*.\n\nI, [name], prostrate myself in utmost sincerity, respectfully following the statutes to submit this memorial, tying the cord of the covenant, exchanging the blade, and drinking the cinnabar water, as decreed by the ritual. I swear that if I violate the precepts or transmit this to unworthy recipients, I shall suffer the calamity of the Exchanged Blades, as the decree commands.\n\nI humbly request that the officials in charge transmit this document and dispatch the covenant deities and the local earth gods to oversee this oath. I await their response with reverence.\n\nYour disciple [name], with awe and trepidation, respectfully submits this.\n\n**Section Three: Ritual for Receiving the Qi-Ingestion Method**\n\nRespectfully submitting this document, your disciple [prefecture, county, township, village], [male/female official, name], aged [number] years.\n\nI, [name], observe the talismanic precepts and have accomplished virtuous conduct. Having previously received the methods of wearing and ingesting qi, I delight in the Primordial Qi. Today, under an auspicious day and hour, with the heavens and earth clear and the vital qi harmonious, I submit this memorial to request the presence of the celestial officials and qi spirits to oversee this rite.",

I humbly implore your mercy and await your gracious response.\n\n**Section Five: The Divine Method of the Golden Elixir**\n\nOne *jin* of golden essence,\nOne *jin* of five-colored *zhi* grasses,\nOne *jin* of five-colored jade essence.\n\nFive immortals refine the golden essence,\nFive jade maidens refine the five-colored *zhi* grasses.\nBoil them in a golden cauldron for seven days until the elixir is complete.\nObserve a hundred days of purification and abstinence.\nCombine the ingredients on the *yín* day of the second month,\nConsume it on the *wù-yín* day.\nAt sunrise during the *mǎo* hour, face east toward the sun and bow eight times.\nThen, with head tilted back, swallow one pill the size of a chicken’s yolk.\nYou will ascend to heaven and enter the Purple Palace,\nWhere the Five Emperors of Heaven will descend to welcome you.\n\nThe golden essence is the white ring above the lungs.\nThe jade essence is the qi within the throat’s nodal structure.\nThe blue *zhi* is the nine apertures of the liver’s vessels.\nThe red *zhi* is the nine apertures of the heart’s vessels.\nThe white *zhi* is the nine apertures of the lungs’ vessels.\nThe black *zhi* is the nine apertures of the kidneys’ vessels.\nThe yellow *zhi* is the nine apertures of the spleen’s vessels.\nThe golden elixir is the qi upon the tongue.\nThe golden cauldron is the central yellow qi.\nThe five immortals are *jiǎ*, *bǐng*, *wù*, *gēng*, and *rén*.\nThe five jade maidens are *yǐ*, *dīng*, *jǐ*, *xīn*, and *guǐ*.\n\nThose who can preserve this will ascend as an entire household.\nIf the Son of Heaven consumes it, the nation will prosper in clarity.\nThe five pestilential diseases and the three ghosts will be subdued,\nHiding and ceasing their activity.\nWeapons and armor will rest,\nThe people will flourish in joy,\nThe ruler will impose no taxes,\nThe subjects will make no tribute.\nGrasses and trees will luxuriate in moisture—\nHow much more so for those who compound the elixir?\n\nA single pill of the golden elixir, weighing one *jin*,\nIs heavier than heaven, earth, and the mountains.\nWhat thing could compare?\n\nHuá-gài-zǐ asked Yù-zǐ, “Do people not say that heaven and earth have nine layers?”\n\nYù-zǐ laughed and said, “How could there be nine heavens above? I have traversed the mortal realm, recording good and gathering evil, seeking the worthy. By night, I roam above the nine heavens and descend below the nine earths. Heaven has nine stars, hence it is called the nine heavens. Earth has nine palaces, hence it is called the nine earths. Humans have nine apertures, hence they are called the nine orifices. The Northern Dipper has nine stars, two of which are hidden in the yin. Humans have nine apertures, two of which are concealed in the yin. The *Kuí-gāng*, also called the *Xuán-jī*, governs the myriad spirits and extends to the eight directions. Heaven is high, and humans follow its course. Those who know the *Kuí-gāng* are born alongside heaven and earth, shine with the sun and moon, transform in the indistinct, and ascend into the Great Clarity. I say to you: your kingdom can become a model for ten thousand generations.”\n\nYù-zǐ said: Above are the nine heavens, below are the nine earths. Above are the nine stars, below are the nine palaces.\n\nThus:\nThe Wood Sovereign of the East is called the Azure Heaven, governing warmth and generating the myriad things.\nThe Fire Sovereign of the South is called the Vermilion Heaven, governing heat and nurturing the myriad things.\nThe Metal Sovereign of the West is called the Bright Heaven, governing coolness and maturing the myriad things.\nThe Water Sovereign of the North is called the Dark Heaven, governing cold and killing the myriad things.\nThe Earth Sovereign of the Center is called the Round Heaven, governing wind.\nThe Northwest, being the highest, is called the Lofty Heaven, governing clarity.\nThe Southeast is called the Primordial Heaven, governing qi.\nThe Southwest is called the Cool Heaven, governing yin.\nThe Northeast is called the August Heaven, governing governance.\n\nThe lords of the nine heavens are collectively called the August Heaven.\n\nYù-zǐ said:\nThe first of the nine lords is the Supreme Sovereign, called the Lofty Heaven, governing clarity and the primordial qi of the mysterious origin. It cherishes and nurtures perfected ones, sages, and Daoists, hence its title: *August Heaven, Supreme Emperor, Great One, Dao Lord*.\nThe second is the North Culmen Lord, called the True Heaven, governing the eight winds and the commands of emperors and kings, hence its title: *August Heaven, Supreme Emperor, Controller of the Myriad Things*.\nThe third is the Clear Yang Lord, called the Azure Heaven, governing the blue and generating the myriad things, recording perfected ones.\nThe fourth is the Great Yang Lord, called the Flaming Heaven, governing heat and nurturing the myriad things.\nThe fifth is the Primordial Lord, called the Cool Heaven, governing perfected ones and immortals, ripening the myriad things.\nThe sixth is the Lesser Yang Lord, called the Bright Heaven, governing the maturation of the myriad things.\nThe seventh is the Great Yin Lord, called the Dark Heaven, governing cold and killing the myriad things.\nThe eighth is the Opening Heaven Lord, called the Lofty Heaven, governing calamities and transformations.\nThe ninth is the Yang Lord, called the Primordial Heaven, governing qi, creating clouds, rain, and lightning, commanding the myriad spirits.

They shall pass through the Mysterious Gate, enjoying peace, longevity, and bliss, attaining high rank and illustrious position, their gold and purple radiant. They shall gain wealth as sought, jade and silk filling their halls. The desires of their hearts shall manifest without seeking, their wishes fulfilled without pursuit. They shall ride boats and chariots, command the Three Luminaries, women becoming noblewomen, men becoming marquises and kings. Like soaring immortals, even the young shall ascend high, treading the Dipper, not merely stepping upon the firmament.\n\nThe Three Officials and Six Records are also called the Three Commands, the Three Lives, the Three Treasures, and the Six Harms. Mysterious qi forms my fence, primordial qi my dwelling, and initial qi my bed and mat. Heaven, as the pure and clear mysterious qi, descends from above my head, enters my abode, and rests in my liver, piercing the Nine Heavens and emerging through my two eyes. Water, as the true white primordial qi, enters my abode from beneath my left and right pulses, rests in my lungs, pierces the Nine Heavens, and emerges through my two nostrils. Earth, as the true yellow initial qi, enters my abode from beneath my left and right feet, rests in my spleen, pierces the Nine Heavens, and emerges through my mouth. May these three qi converge, enveloping my body, year after year without end.\n\nNext, visualize the twenty-seven Lords of Vital Qi within the human body: the hair as the Azure City Lord, the head as the Three Terraces Lord, the brows as the Eight Poles Lord, the two ears as the Decisive Brightness Lords, the left eye as the Mysterious Brightness Lord, the right eye as the Primordial Brightness Lord, the nose as the Wondrous Gate of the Celestial Circuit Lord, the mouth as the Arrayed Primordial Jade Gate Lord, the teeth as the Eight Kings Lords, the tongue as the Boundless Lord, the throat as the Commandant Lord, the larynx as the Nine Ministers Lord, the liver as the Crimson Palace Lord, the lungs as the Florid Canopy Lord, the gallbladder as the Longevity Lord, the heart as the Cinnabar Prime Lord, the navel as the Purple-White Lord, the spleen as the Yellow Court Lord, the stomach as the Great Granary Lord, the large intestine as the Nourishing Mother Lord, the small intestine as the Guiding and Conducting Lord, the left kidney as the Mysterious Wondrous Lord, the right kidney as the Mysterious Primordial Lord, the intestines as the Transcendent Way Lord, the Triple Burner as the Mysterious Elder Lord, the two knees as the Little Chariot Lingering Lords, and the two feet as the Thunder, Lightning, and Cloud Qi Lords. May the Lion seize these twenty-seven vital qi and keep them within its body, never to depart recklessly.\n\nNext, visualize the Three Lords of the Red Child within the Lion’s body: for me, they reside in the Mud Pill, moving through the Crimson Palace and Cinnabar Field, never to depart recklessly. The Perfected One, styled Zidan, governs the human heart and presides over the myriad spirits for eternal life. The Red Child, styled Taishang, governs the human head and presides over longevity and life extension, restraining spirits from desires, embodying effortless action, and illuminating the completion of thirty thousand affairs.\n\nThe Upper One resides in the human brain—its spirit is the Red Child. The Middle One resides in the human heart—its spirit is the Perfected One. The Lower One resides three inches below the human navel—its spirit is the Infant. The Dao of human life arises entirely from these; ceaseless contemplation shall reveal the spirits. The brain is the Purple Tenuity Palace, the heart the Grotto Chamber Palace, and three inches below the navel the Cinnabar Field Palace. By constantly contemplating the qi of the spirits within these Three Palaces, one may attain longevity and enduring vision.\n\nNext, contemplate the Five Palaces within the human body. The six bowels and five viscera: the liver as the Wood Palace, the heart as the Fire Palace, the lungs as the Metal Palace, the kidneys as the Water Palace, and the spleen as the Earth Palace—these are also the five viscera. The liver is the Left General’s Prefecture, the lungs the Right General’s Prefecture, the heart the Front General’s Prefecture, the kidneys the Rear General’s Prefecture, the navel the Central Cavalry Great General’s Prefecture, and the head the Supreme General’s Prefecture.\n\nHe who knows the internal perceives the external. Knowing the five phases and six bowels within, the five viscera and five phases: the liver as Wood, the heart as Fire, the lungs as Metal, the kidneys as Water, and the spleen as Earth—these are the five viscera. The lungs as the Jade Hall Palace and the Ministry of Works Prefecture, the heart as the Crimson Hall Palace and the Primordial Yang Prefecture, the liver as the Clear and Cool Palace and the Orchid Terrace Prefecture, the gallbladder as the Purple Tenuity Palace and the Primordial Ultimate Prefecture, the kidneys as the Secluded Pasture Palace and the Supreme Harmony Prefecture, the spleen as the Central Yellow Palace and the Supreme Simplicity Prefecture—these are the six bowels. The lungs store the corporeal soul, the liver stores the ethereal soul, the heart stores the spirit, the kidneys store essence, and the spleen stores the will—these are the five viscera.\n\nThe five phases: in heaven as the five stars, on earth as the five phases, in humans as the five viscera, and in color as the five hues. In heaven as the five stars: Jupiter in the east, Mars in the south, Venus in the west, Mercury in the north, and Saturn in the center. On earth as the five phases: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In humans as the five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. In color as the five hues: azure, red, white, black, and yellow.\n\nAs for the intermediate colors: Jia and Ji as wife and husband, yellow entering azure becomes green; Bing and Xin as wife and husband, white entering red becomes crimson; Ding and Ren as wife and husband, red entering black becomes purple; Wu and Gui as wife and husband, black entering yellow becomes dark blue. Thus, the intermediate colors arise: Jia as Wood, Yi as Forest, Bing as Fire, Ding as Ash, Wu as Earth, Ji as Ochre, Geng as Metal, Xin as Ore, Ren as Water, and Gui as Mud.\n\nWood qi has its generation, Fire qi its growth, Metal qi its killing, and Water qi its extinction.

In the three months of summer, all things grow to maturity—thus Fire qi has its growth.",

In the three months of winter, all creatures that stir lie buried, unable to fly or flee—thus Water qi has its concealment and extinction.\n\nWood qi has its generation: Yi is the wife of Geng, thus it envelops Metal qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns elm into green beans—hence named the Azure Grain of the East.\n\nFire qi has its growth: Ding is the wife of Ren, thus it envelops Water qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns mulberry into wheat—hence named the Cinnabar Grain of the South.\n\nEarth qi has its nurturing: Ji is the wife of Jia, thus it envelops Wood qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns melon into millet—hence named the Central □ Grain.\n\nMetal qi has its killing: Xin is the wife of Bing, thus it envelops Fire qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns jujube into rice—hence named the White Grain of the West.\n\nWater qi has its concealment: Gui is the wife of Wu, thus it envelops Earth qi. First following the Yang in creation, then conforming to the Yin in transformation, it turns tangerine into soybeans—hence named the Dark Grain of the North.\n\nWhy do the Five Phases alternate as husband and wife? What is the reason for these pairings?\nWhen Earth desires to travel east, Wood goes to restrain it—thus Wu marries Ji as Jia’s wife.\nWhen Wood desires to travel west, Metal goes to fell it—thus Jia marries Yi as Geng’s wife.\nWhen Metal desires to travel south, Fire goes to slay it—thus Geng marries Xin as Bing’s wife.\nWhen Fire desires to travel north, Water douses and extinguishes it—thus Bing marries Ding as Ren’s wife.\nWhen Water desires to travel south, Earth goes to drain it—thus Ren marries Gui as Wu’s wife.\nThus the nature of wives is known.\n\nWhy do the Five Phases mutually punish and destroy, leading to death?\nWhy does Wood piercing Earth not destroy it? Why does Fire burning Metal not destroy it?\nWood and Fire are both Yang qi, inclined toward generation and not killing. Metal felling Wood causes death; Water dousing Fire causes death—both are due to Yin qi’s greed, and all such punishments result in death.\n\nThe Five Phases correspond to the five viscera: the heart to the Fire Phase, the liver to the Wood Phase, the lungs to the Metal Phase, the kidneys to the Water Phase, and the spleen to the Earth Phase.\n\nThe five viscera follow the Five Phases: the liver belongs to Wood, yet why does it sink when it receives Water?\nBecause it is Jia’s wife and receives Earth qi, causing it to sink.\n\nThe lungs belong to Metal, yet why do they float when they receive Water?\nBecause Xin is Bing’s wife and receives Fire qi, causing them to float.\n\nThe spleen belongs to Earth and cannot reside in the center when it receives Water.\nGui is Wu’s wife, and Earth is the center of the Five Phases—Gui stirs Earth.\nThus, when the spleen receives Water, it does not rise to the top nor sink to the bottom but remains precisely in the center.\n\nWhy is Gui Wu’s wife?\nEarth, in the midst of the Five Phases, is explained through this principle to harmonize the intent of the Five Phases.\n\nWood begins in Hai, flourishes in Mao, and dies in Wei and Hai. Mao is a Yin thief—no officials may be appointed, and no affairs are auspicious.\nWater begins in Shen, flourishes in Zi, and dies in Chen and Shen. Zi is the Greedy Wolf—it cannot be employed.\nChen is treacherous, Wei is perverse, Xu is upright, Chou is public—treachery, perversity, evil, public, and upright are distinguished.\n\n**Section on Cutting Off Grain: Authentic Cinnabar Elixir Recipe**\nUse three liang of white honey, half a jin of white wax, and three liang of authentic cinnabar. Combine these three ingredients.\nMelt the wax over fire, then add the cinnabar and honey. Heat and stir, performing nine upward and nine downward motions. When the medicine is ready, form pills the size of wu-tong seeds.\nTake one pill three times a day. It lightens the body, boosts qi, and allows one to go a full year without hunger. Prepare this in secret, ensuring no woman sees the process.\n\n**Longevity Elixir**\nIn the seventh month, gather two sheng of fully red paper mulberry fruit, dry in the shade, pound, and mix with water. Take a seven-fen spoonful. Over time, it enables one to see ghosts and perceive objects beneath the earth.\n\n**Divine Immortal’s Cinnabar Longevity Elixir**\nTake three jin of cinnabar, grind finely, and sift through double-layered silk. Place in a bronze vessel, pour nine sheng of pure, strong vinegar over it, and stir until it resembles mud. Set in a warm place to dry. Repeat the process until one jin of cinnabar has absorbed three sheng of vinegar—then the medicine is ready. Dry it in the sun for thirty days. When it turns purple, stir it; if it does not stick to the hands when pulled, resembling malt sugar, it is ready. Form pills the size of sesame seeds. Take three pills daily with well-water, always in the morning.\n\nBefore taking the medicine, fast and purify for thirty days, bathing in a five-fragrance decoction. On the first day of ingestion, the three worms will be expelled. By the sixth day, all illnesses in the body will be cured. After sixty days, visions will appear. After one year, white hair turns black, and lost teeth regrow. After two years, one’s complexion reverts to that of a fifteen-year-old, and divine beings will come of their own accord.\n\nIncrease the dosage by one pill daily until reaching nine pills. After three years of ingestion, divine beings will appear, clad in purple and orchid robes, bearing trays of purple mushrooms and orchids to offer. Do not fear—calm your mind and steady your intent. All things will come naturally, and you will command a hundred ghosts and spirits, seeing them all.\n\nThe first spirit is named Shang, the second Shou, and the third Heng. These spirits can summon all things and call forth the names of a hundred ghosts, bringing them to you. You will be able to enter water, fire, wood, metal, stone, and earth—indeed, all places—without obstruction. Transformations will occur naturally, and you will see clearly for ten thousand li. The power of the Dao will flourish, and you will rise without effort. You will inwardly perceive the five viscera, becoming a True Person, recognized by all divine beings. You will traverse the hidden and obscure, achieving the perfection of the Dao. Your lifespan will extend to eighteen thousand years, and with continuous ingestion, it will be boundless.",

      "translated_text": "Drink only a little water. When preparing the elixir, you must fast and purify yourself. The elixir should be compounded before the Summer Solstice; do not ingest it after the Summer Solstice. The precepts forbid consuming blood, wine, meats, raw vegetables, and the like. This is not to be transmitted to the unworthy, lest calamity befall your descendants. The divine immortals’ secret formula is most excellent.\n\nThe Dao of cultivating perfection takes concentrated meditation, ingestion of talismans, guarding the spirit, and refining qi as its foundation. For all who refine qi, first ingest this talisman. After a year of grain avoidance, then transmit it to the worthy and enlightened, who will diligently follow the method as prescribed. The talisman is written in cinnabar.\n\nIngesting the first two talismans will leave you hungry after a hundred days; ingest this talisman to supplement them.\n\n**Right: Divine Talisman for Qi Ingestion and Grain Avoidance**\n\nAt dawn, use well-flower water or east-flowing water. Swallow six talismans daily, ingesting them all at once as a regular practice. Recite thus: \"The initial method of qi ingestion begins at the *mao* hour, the head facing *mao*; at the *chen* hour, face *chen*; at the *si* hour, face *si*; at the *wu* hour, face *wu*.\" From midday to the *hai* hour, these are the hours of dead qi; do not absorb qi then. Avoid strong winds, heavy rain, thunder, cold yin, and dark gloom. Await the clarity of heaven and earth and the rising of the sun before absorbing qi. If you absorb qi after the *si* and *wu* hours, yin qi will overpower yang, harming the five viscera. Ingesting qi will then be of no benefit. Be diligent and cautious in practice.\n\n**Chapter Seven: Talisman Grades**\n\n**Bian Que’s Talisman for Sudden Death**, issued by the Orthodox Unity Perfected Person. This talisman treats sudden affliction by evil, flying corpse entering the abdomen, acute pain, and lockjaw. Write it in cinnabar on water or on paper as a talisman. Form three pills and swallow them; if not cured, repeat until three full courses are completed. Write it on the area below the heart and the abdomen, inscribing it large—none will fail to recover.\n\n**Master Changsang’s Secret Talisman**\nThis talisman treats heart injury from malign influences, with loss of breath. Write it in cinnabar on white paper three times, place the three talismans into three cups of washing water, and ingest them in order from left to right. After three talismans, recovery follows.\n\nThis talisman treats sudden abdominal pain and distension, with qi on the verge of collapse, resembling a flying corpse. Write it in cinnabar on the patient’s abdomen, inscribing it large so it spans the entire length of the abdomen for best effect. It may also be ingested as a talisman.\n\nThese two talismans treat sudden encounters with evil, where a visiting ghost pierces the heart, causing pain and qi on the verge of collapse. Write them in cinnabar on white paper. First ingest the upper talisman; if the condition does not cease after a moment, ingest the lower talisman. If it still does not cease, begin again from the upper talisman. If the patient has died but warmth remains below the heart and slight movement is present, ingesting the talisman will still cure. If the mouth is locked and cannot be opened, break a tooth to insert the talisman; once it enters the mouth, it need not reach the stomach. Alternatively, insert the talisman into a scallion leaf. Insert it deeply into the nose, then push it further with water, shaking to ensure passage, and the patient will revive. This talisman is divinely efficacious.\n\n**Zhang Tianshi’s Account of Bian Que’s Formula for Instant Revival from Sudden Death**, originally bestowed upon the Lady of Southern Peak, is recorded here. When writing the talisman, first purify yourself with washing, then proceed facing the moon, holding your breath as you write. The method requires first outlining the perimeter in blue-black, then writing in cinnabar within. If blue and cinnabar are unavailable, ink may be used. For talismans treating demonic illness, grind tiger bone and true pearl together, then use the mixture to write the talisman.\n\n**The Great Plain Perfected Person’s Instruction to Lord Pei on Two Methods for Attaining Perfection:**\nAt the first light of dawn, face the rising sun, close your eyes, and hold your breath for ten cycles. Then swallow the sunlight ten times, visualizing the sunlight entering your mouth and swallowing it. Next, visualize the Azure Emperor Lord descending with the sunlight to your left. Then visualize the Vermilion Emperor descending with the sunlight to your right. Next, visualize the White Emperor descending with the sunlight to your back. Then visualize the Black Emperor descending with the sunlight to your left hand. Finally, visualize the Yellow Emperor descending with the sunlight to your right hand. Once all Five Emperors have arrived, visualize a crimson cloud chariot of the sun-mirror, drawn by nine dragons, descending with the sunlight before you. Then, together with the Five Emperors, board the chariot and race toward the sun.\n\nLord Pei practiced concentrated meditation on a solitary mountain. Within a year, faint forms appeared. Within two years, the Five Emperors descended with the sun and manifested at his sides. Within three years, they conversed and laughed with him all day. Within five years, the Five Emperors and the Sun Lord shared a flying dragon chariot with Lord Pei, traveling east to the Celestial Cavern of the Sun, the Eastern Palace of the Great Chariot, the City of the Eight Poles, ascending the Terrace of Illuminated Perfection, and sitting in the Hall of Sparse Forests. There, they bestowed upon Lord Pei the *Chapter for Commanding Spirits* and the *Talisman of the Nine Possessions*. He consumed the Azure Essence of the Sun’s Radiance and drank the Cloudy Azure Profound Nectar. Thereafter, he roamed daily with the Five Emperors and the Sun Lord—this is the so-called *Way of Racing the Sun*.\n\nWithin the sun, there are also Five Emperors. The first is the Sun Lord. The *Central Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* states: \"If you wish to become a Perfected Person, visualize the Sun Lord harnessing a vermilion phoenix, riding the celestial radiant clouds, and journeying east to the Sparse Forests. Enter the Gate of Perfection through concentrated meditation, and you will obtain the essential Dao, named *Upper Clarity Spirit*. You will be ranked among the Perfected Officials, wielding the *Writings of Yu Yi*—these are the two methods for attaining perfection.\"\n\nAt dusk, face the moon, close your eyes, and hold your breath for nine cycles. Then swallow the moonlight nine times, visualizing the moonlight entering your mouth and swallowing it. Next, visualize the Azure Empress descending with the moonlight to your left. Then visualize the Vermilion Empress descending with the moonlight to your right. Next, visualize the White Empress descending with the moonlight to your back. Then visualize the Black Empress descending with the moonlight to your left hand. Finally, visualize the Yellow Empress descending with the moonlight to your right hand.",

      "translated_text": "The Five Empresses all arrive, and you then visualize the *Flowing Spirit Flying Cloud Chariot*, drawn by ten dragons, descending with the moonlight before you. You further visualize the Five Empresses riding together with you toward the moon.\n\nMaster Pei dwelled upon the empty mountain, cultivating practice and refining contemplation. Within one year, he vaguely perceived their forms. Within two years, the Five Empresses all appeared in their lunar aspects, standing to his left and right, laughing and rejoicing together. Within five years, the Five Empresses of the Moon accompanied him in the flying dragon chariot, journeying west to the *Gate of Six Ridges*, the *Mound of Eight Endings*, the *Palace of Harmonious Dawn*, and the *City of Eight Sceneries*. They ascended the *Terrace of Seven Spirits*, sat in the *Hall of Great Harmony*, and bestowed upon Master Pei the *Flowing Star Night-Shining Writ*, the *Talisman of Ten Luminances*, the *Yellow-Purple Essence of Divine Nectar*, and the *Moonflower Cloud-Cream*. Thus, he roamed with the Five Empresses every evening—this is called the *Way of Rushing to the Moon*.\n\nWithin the moon, there are also Five Empresses. The *Outer Scripture* states: \"The Lady of the Sun Lord is the Sovereign of Sun and Moon.\" The *Middle Chapter of the Supreme Hidden Writ* says: \"If you wish to ascend to heaven, visualize the Moon Empress, harness ten flying dragons, and ride my *Flowing Spirit* westward to the *Six Ridges*, then enter the *Imperial Hall* in refined contemplation to behold the *Celestial August Emperor of the Upper Heaven*, where you will wield the *Writings of Jeweled Patterns*.\"\n\nMaster Pei said: \"In refined contemplation, face the sun and visualize the Five Lords of the Sun within it. At night, face the moon in refined contemplation and visualize the Five Empresses of the Moon within it. Within five years, the spirits of sun and moon will both arrive, and together you will ride the flying dragons to roam the *Great Mystery*. At the beginning of study, the Five Spirits will manifest their forms, bestow scriptures, and grant divine mushrooms. Upon completion of cultivation, the Five Lords and Empresses of Sun and Moon will harness the reins of purity and emptiness, riding the *Great Cinnabar* clouds to pay homage at the *Three Origins*, bowing before the *Golden Gates*. Then you will obtain the *Jade Spirit* and *Golden Perfection*, wielding authority over all spirits. Jade maidens and jade lads will attend you day and night, receiving scriptures to become Perfected. You will be granted the *Tiger Talisman of the False Spirit* to command the *Six Heavens of Severity*; the *Flowing Gold Bell* to summon all essences; and the *Azure-Furred Staff* to traverse the *Nine Palaces*. All this arises from refined contemplation of the subtle and mysterious, profoundly moving the heart of heaven, thus causing spirits to descend upon your body and ascend to the *Imperial Court*.\"\n\nThis is the practice of the Daoist adept—it is not necessary to already be an immortal. When Master Pei secluded himself in a hidden chamber where sun and moon were not visible, he merely visualized and contemplated them in his heart, without needing to see the sun or moon. The essential point is to gaze upon them when visible, direct your will single-mindedly, refine your contemplation to its utmost, and there will be nothing you cannot penetrate. This is the crucial teaching.\n\nFirst visualize the Five Stars within your body. When the heart is fixed upon the Dao, the true spirits are also complete, reflecting your intent. If great difficulties have not yet been overcome, feign humility while inwardly storing truth, and though you may not yet turn back the years, in the *Western Elm’s* time, the *Mysterious Youth* will reemerge. The *Mysterious One* is steadfast; the will is diligent. Even if your strength wanes, your face wrinkles, and white hair grows upon your crown, my Dao can transform you into an infant in but a moment. It is only a question of the strength of your will—whether young or old in study, it matters not. I have gone before you; such a one is he.\n\nAnother method involves preparing a memorial: one foot and two inches in length, inscribed in cinnabar with the following text: \"[Your] prefecture, county, village, and personal name, desiring longevity, transcendence, and ascension to the immortals, to soar through the *Upper Clarity*, to become a true and divine person. [I beseech] the spirit lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Three Offices, and the Nine Bureaus to absolve my transgressions.\" After inscribing the memorial, bind it with a pair of gold rings using green silk thread. Bow twice facing north, place the memorial upon a stone, and burn it with fire until it is reduced to ashes. Then conceal the rings within a hidden crevice in the stone and depart without looking back. Alternatively, you may burn a pair of shoes as a substitute for the rings—ancients called these the *Leisurely Pearls*.\n\nIf envious and slanderous people steal them, such theft not only brings no benefit but may even hasten death. After ten such occurrences, the Five Lords of Heaven, the Three Offices, and the Nine Bureaus will issue successive decrees to absolve a person’s transgressions, inscribe their name among the immortals, and register their form in the celestial records. Entering the mountains to seek divine mushrooms and spirit herbs, all you seek will be obtained. Divine immortals and jade maidens will naturally come to protect and attend you.",

Divine immortals offer their protection and aid, ever desiring that mortals attain the Dao, opening their hearts and minds. Malevolent ghosts and ancient specters dare not test one’s resolve. Those who practice this Way do so with ease and without peril.\n\nShould a Daoist remain ignorant of this method, entering the mountains will bring frequent illness and misfortune, often being tested by ghostly entities. If dwelling among men, such a one will know only hardship, sickness, and unfulfilled desires. But those who walk this path shall attain long life and become divine immortals.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Prohibitions for Those Who Establish Resolve in Cultivating the Dao, Nurturing Spirit, and Seeking Immortality**\n\nThose who establish resolve in cultivating the Dao, nurturing spirit, and seeking immortality must bathe regularly to invite the descent of the numinous qi and the Jade Maidens. Without bathing, the divine qi will not come.\n\nDaoists must keep their mouths closed and refrain from speech. Those who speak of the Dao will be harmed by the Three Offices—this must be strictly guarded against. If one’s secret practices or words are revealed, a year is deducted from one’s lifespan.\n\nWhen engaging in deep meditation, one should first burn incense to the left and right. Daoists should dwell alone in a chamber, avoiding mingling with others. Even clothing and belongings must not be lent to others, lest inauspicious and impure qi intrude.\n\nThose of like mind are called \"fellow covenanters.\" One must avoid defilement and the sight of corpses, for these offend the true qi.\n\nConsuming mica powder while continuing carnal relations or eating blood-rich foods will not extend life but instead, over time, cause abscesses in the joints. When ingesting jade, one should also take realgar. Without it, prolonged use will generate internal heat, and if cold water is poured over the body as if dousing a withered plant, it may prove fatal.\n\nIngesting jade shards severs the union of yin and yang. When drinking jade nectar, one must drink cold water and avoid hot foods. All who consume jade must abstain from the Five Pungent Roots and blood-rich foods, or they cannot attain long life.\n\nThose who take herbal medicines yet eat pork will only worsen their ailments. Before consuming mica, one should first ingest sesame for a year. Without this, it will not harm but may be taken afterward.\n\nAll who consume realgar or the Eight Minerals must abstain from blood-rich foods. Otherwise, over time, they may suffer hemiplegia—beware, beware!\n\nTaking elixirs into defiled households or consuming meat and strong flavors will harm the practitioner. Daoists must universally observe these prohibitions.\n\nWhen consuming Solomon’s seal, avoid plums. When taking wood-based medicines, avoid peaches. When ingesting rehmannia, avoid large cuts of meat. When taking asparagus root, avoid carp.\n\n**Chapter Nine: On Entering Mountains to Gather Medicinal Substances, with Notes on Auspicious Days**\n\nWhen entering mountains for deep meditation, one must not hear the barking of dogs—beware, beware! All who enter mountains must empty their minds for a hundred days. Without this, they will be plagued by fear, encountering tigers, wolves, vipers, and serpents.\n\nTo gather the Eight Minerals in the mountains, lead a white dog and hold a white chicken, and you will find what you seek. When gathering mushrooms, do so when overcast and the sun is hidden, not when it shines.\n\nCarry a peck of white rice to facilitate your search. Two beans make one *daogui*, two *daogui* make one pinch, and two pinches make one square-inch spoon. For powdered or pelletized medicines, one square-inch spoon holds ten firmiana seeds.\n\n**Lord Lao’s Dragon-Riding Talisman:**\nTake five *jin* of cinnabar and three *jin* of mercury, grind the cinnabar into powder, and mix it with the mercury. Place it beneath the eastern eaves of a house where rainwater flows, then perform the Yu step and draw in qi to retrieve it after a hundred days. Add three *jin* of mica powder, steam it in a steamer for a day and a night until harmonized, then stir in one *sheng* of white honey. Seal the mouth tightly with wax and wrap it securely. On the day of *Lichun*, place it at the bottom of a well. On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, retrieve it. The elixir will resemble mercury. Take a dose the size of a square-inch spoon, three times daily, while maintaining a fast. One may then ascend and descend upon clouds without hindrance, attended by jade lads, traversing ten thousand *li* in an instant.\n\nWhen compounding this elixir, one must first purify through fasting and abstinence. Avoid funeral homes, defiled places, women, chickens, and dogs, lest one’s sincerity be compromised. This elixir enables divine transformation. Among the thousands of volumes on ingesting and consuming elixirs passed down through the ages, these eight methods are esteemed as the most wondrous secrets. Without regard to days or months, they allow mastery over all spirits, altering one’s appearance and form, merging with the divine in boundless transformation, ascending by day or vanishing into the earth, unconstrained by the Nine Classics.\n\nAll implements used in Daoist practices are offered to the Great One, while firewood is gathered only from auspicious sources. Those I have recently instructed have all achieved their desires. Even a small measure of this practice leads to immortality.",

      "translated_text": "Consume one *sheng*, and all parasites will be expelled, granting a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years.\n\nAnother method: Take one *sheng* of *wuyi* (elm seeds), grind to powder, and mix with one *sheng* of hemp seed juice. Fast overnight, then consume the entire preparation—all nine types of parasites will be expelled, granting a lifespan of one hundred and twenty years.\n\nAnother method: Take four *bozi* (cypress seeds), four *chi* (fermented soybeans), four peach kernels, and four *badou* (croton seeds). For all four ingredients, roast until yellow, then pound and sift. Mix with honey to form pills the size of hemp seeds. Children should take two pills, those of average constitution should take two pills the size of small beans, and adults should take three pills the size of large beans—millions of parasites will be expelled.\n\nAnother method: Take one *jin* of mulberry root bark, soak in dark water, and simmer over a low flame until reduced to three *sheng*. Strain and discard the dregs. Fast overnight, then consume one and a half *sheng*; if unable to tolerate it, take one *sheng*, and the parasites will be expelled. The following day, consume again, and parasites will surely be expelled. This method not only treats parasites but also cold conditions and other ailments. Even if the illness recurs over time, this remedy will prevent future outbreaks. Before taking the medicine, eat roasted jujubes, then consume the preparation to expel parasites—it strengthens the will and sharpens the eyes.\n\nA secret formula from *Huainan*: Use realgar powder mixed with *hundun* (chaotic primordial) white. Consume three pills the size of large beans, and one’s vision will extend a thousand *li*. When first entering the sacred mountains to seek seclusion and transcend the world, exit through the Celestial Treasury and enter the Earthly Gate. The six *gui* days are the Celestial Treasury, and the six *ji* days are the Earthly Gate. To align with the Dao and attain immortality, act at the hour of the Celestial Heart. When first entering the mountains to seek immortality, choose a day of the Celestial Heart—specifically, the *yin* day of the six *ji*. The hours of the Celestial Heart are *jisi*, *jimao*, *jichou*, *jihai*, *jiyou*, and *jiwei*. Begin your journey on such a day. When entering the sacred mountains, always use the *jiazi* day for opening and the *chu* day. Place five-inch squares of five-colored silk on a large stone, and your endeavors will surely succeed. At the outset, avoid the three *geng*, three *xin*, and three *ren*. The three *geng* refer to *geng* days, *geng* hours, and *geng* lands; the three *xin* and three *ren* follow the same pattern.\n\nMethod to enter mountains, forests, and wild marshes to repel snakes: Upon reaching the mountain’s base, inhale deeply once, then pluck a handful of grass from your left side with your left hand. Inhale again, place the grass in the path, and inhale once more while marking it with a stone. Then proceed without looking back. If accompanied by others, have them cross first. After they have passed, inhale once more and place the grass in their path. Each person should inhale once upon crossing, and once all have received the *qi*, proceed without looking back. After several hundred steps, you may move freely. Whether traveling ahead or behind, you will encounter snakes coiled like ropes and tigers turned to stone.\n\nThe Perfected One’s method for entering mountains: Hold a knife in the left hand—this is called *wogu* (clenched fist). Inhale thirty-eight breaths and exhale twenty-eight breaths, and nothing will be feared.\n\nTreatment for sudden parasitic poisoning with abdominal pain (caused by toads, tadpoles, or dung beetles): Take *qinyan* (swallow) droppings dissolved in water and consume two *qianbi*—this will induce vomiting of all parasites.\n\nThe *San Dong* Daoist mountain-dwelling cultivation protocols conclude here.",
