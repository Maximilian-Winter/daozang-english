Therefore, the interweaving of yin and yang, the union and separation of odd and even, all find their mutual resonance therein.\n\nIn the *Rites of Zhou*, the three *Yi* systems all consist of eight fundamental trigrams, with their distinctions comprising sixty-four hexagrams. Taking the eight as the warp and the sixty-four as the weft, the sequence of hexagram formation reveals the positions of the Primordial Heaven diagram. Thus, when Fuxi composed the *Yi*, the diagram already existed, transmitted through the Three Dynasties. Hence, Confucius’s explanations of the *ji* (extremes), *yi* (modes), *xiang* (images), and *gua* (trigrams), along with his doubling of them, as well as the methods of Jing Junming and Wei Boyang for incorporating the celestial stems into the hexagram qi, all follow the sequence of the circular diagram. The Primordial Heaven diagram has thus existed for a long time. Yet later scholars of the *Yi* no longer traced the original source of its composition, so although the diagram remained, it was not transmitted among scholars until Master Shao revived it.\n\nEarlier scholars claimed that Master Shao transmitted it to Li Mu, who received it from Chen Tuan (Huiyi). This transmission must not have been false. Some have also suggested that the Primordial Heaven diagram in the *Qiankun Birth of Learning* originated from the Cai family, and that Master Zhu adopted it. Yet since Zhu Hanshang already possessed this diagram, its origin from the Shao lineage is beyond doubt. Even if the sages were to return, they would not alter these words.\n\nHowever, the Dao of the *Yi* is vast and boundless. Scholars, following their own insights, may all attain understanding. Only when their insights arise naturally, without forced interpretation, can they establish a school of thought, even if their discoveries were not previously expounded by the ancients.\n\nMaster Zhang Zhongchun of Qingjiang, endowed with keen intelligence and profound learning, is well-versed in all the classics but is especially profound in the *Yi*. He once applied his diligent study to compose the *Explanation of the Images of the *Yi***. In it, the *ji*, *yi*, *xiang*, and *gua* are illustrated with the odd above and the even below, each generating yin and yang, firmness and softness, inner and outer, and mutual transformations. The origins of hexagram formation, the principles of the four seasons, the discourse on nature and destiny, the numbers of the diagrams and writings, and the changes and divination of the milfoil stalks are all comprehensively covered.\n\nIn the circular diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams, Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun are arranged in a rotating cycle, revealing the movements and stillness of heaven and earth, the qi nodes of a full year’s celestial circuit, and the monthly progression of the moon’s phases. In the square diagram, Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Gen, and Kun are arranged vertically from top to bottom and horizontally from left to right, allowing for the derivation of the hexagram qi of the twelve months and the images of the twenty-eight lunar lodges in the *Cantong Qi* and Master Shao’s *Taiyi Hymn*.\n\nThe diagrams proceed from the mutual generation of *Qian* and *Kun*, with yang ascending leftward in sequence and yin descending rightward in sequence, so that the order of the six yang and six yin hexagrams is clearly evident in their application. In the diagram of the eight palaces of the Manifested Heaven, each transforming into seven hexagrams, the images of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions are arranged in orderly opposition. All these are ingeniously and neatly structured, requiring no forced effort, with no room for addition or subtraction, nor any doubt or dispute. Such is the meaning of arising naturally without forced interpretation. This work should be appended to the diagrams of Master Shao and Master Zhu, establishing its own school. It also demonstrates that the images of the *Yi* are universally resonant, and only when scholars follow their own insights and attain genuine understanding can their work be transmitted to posterity without confusion.\n\nMaster Zhongchun’s learning is lofty and enlightened, and I have known him the longest. Upon the completion of the *Explanation of the Images*, he first honored me with its presentation. I particularly admire its seamless integration of images and its precise and meticulous structure. Thus, I have presumptuously inscribed this preface at the beginning and return it to him.\n\nRespectfully written by Huang Zhencheng of Ziyun Mountain in the seventh month of autumn, the dingyou year of the Zhizheng era.\n\n**The *Yi* states:** “The Yellow River brought forth the Diagram; the Luo River brought forth the Writing. The sages took them as their model.”\nThe diagrams and writings are the images of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The *Yi* is the means by which the sages depicted the spirit of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Thus, every movement and stillness takes form as the Supreme Ultimate. The ceaseless generation of odd and even, the mutual transformation of movement and stillness, the four images above and below, and their left-right interactions give rise to the hexagram drawings of the *Yi*.\n\nDrawing heaven,\nDrawing earth,\nDrawing water,\nDrawing fire,\nDrawing marsh,\nDrawing mountain,\nWind arising from marsh,\nThunder arising from mountain,\nTrigrams representing images,\nImages giving rise to names,\nNames revealing meanings,\nMeanings rectifying words,\nWords conveying the composition of the *Yi* book.\n\nTo align with the principles of nature and destiny, to explore the origins of ritual and music, and to accomplish transformations and enact the workings of spirits and deities—all fundamentally derive from the images and numbers of the *Diagrams and Writings* alone.\n\nThe diagram of heaven (○) represents the One. The diagram of earth ( ) represents the Two. The central diagram ( ) embodies the Four Images and the Five Phases.\n\nThe yang numbers—one, three, five—are the \"three of heaven,\" where three is called *san*. The yin numbers—two, four—are the \"two of earth,\" where two is called *liang*. The \"three of heaven\" culminates in nine, the active expression of yang. The \"two of earth\" culminates in six, the active expression of yin.\n\nThe horizontal lines in the *Writings* form the structure of the three trigrams. The well-like arrangement in the *Writings* marks the positions of the nine trigrams. The intersecting vertical and horizontal lines (＃５) unite the fifteen trigrams: *Qian* nine and *Kun* six sum to fifteen; *Kan* seven and *Li* eight sum to fifteen; *Zhen* seven and *Xun* eight sum to fifteen; *Gen* seven and *Dui* eight sum to fifteen. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft to one another. Fifty-five is the pivotal number of the *Diagrams and Writings*. When five is doubled to ten, the left, right, front, and back form the four cardinal directions of the *River Diagram*. When five intersects with ten, the four cardinals and four corners compose the nine palaces of the *Luo Writing*. The leftward, circular motion follows the roundness of heaven, from which the armillary sphere and celestial reckoning arise. The rightward, linear arrangement follows the squareness of earth, from which the systems of enfeoffment and well-field governance emerge. Encompassing the square within the circle and confining the circle within the square, one thereby models the transformations of heaven and earth without excess, and nurtures the myriad things without omission.\n\nMan alone embodies the virtue of heaven and earth, the convergence of yin and yang, the meeting of spirits and deities, and the essence of the Five Phases. The upper half of the body corresponds to heaven, the lower half to earth. The head is round, the feet square; the abdomen is yin, the back yang. The eyes of *Li* shine outward, the ears of *Kan* hear within. The mouth and nose resemble mountains and marshes, while voice and breath mirror thunder and wind. Thus, the principles of the world are fulfilled and take their place within him.\n\nKnow then that the *Yi* is my heart, and my heart is the *Yi*. Expounding its diagrams, one arranges the six positions to complete the Three Powers. Ordering its sequences, one follows the six seasons to enact the Four Phases. Uniting its forms, one embodies the six constituents of the physical self. Tracing its channels, one perfects the six pulses to preserve spirit and qi. Outlining its classics, one establishes the six canons of governance and education. Harmonizing its tones, one balances the six pitches to regulate sound. Instituting its codes, one refines the six statutes to govern. Commanding its hosts, one pacifies the six armies to secure the state. Thus, by means of positions, one illuminates the Dao; by means of seasons, one cultivates virtue; by means of forms, one fathoms nature; by means of pulses, one consolidates destiny; by means of classics, one examines ritual; by means of tones, one rectifies music; by means of codes, one governs justly; by means of hosts, one administers punishment with care. Therein, the substance and function of the eight trigrams of the *Great Yi* are fully realized.\n\nThe eight diagrams above are appended to the outer chapter. As the eight trigrams intermingle, rub against, and stir one another, they are doubled, transformed, and extended, giving rise to the circular and square diagrams of the sixty-four hexagrams in their varied applications. The circular diagrams emulate heaven, the square diagrams model earth, the transformations follow the Dao, and the applications harmonize with righteousness. Then, through milfoil stalks, one synthesizes their numbers; through divination, one clarifies their auguries. The processes of division, suspension, counting, and return—along with the interplay of lines and the permutations of branches—are all rendered as diagrams to manifest their images and as explanations to expound their purport.\n\nThough these words do not adhere to the interpretations of earlier Confucian scholars, they may yet approximate the grand intent of the sages in composing the *Yi*. Corrections and verifications are earnestly sought from those of like mind.\n\nIn the twenty-fourth year of the Zhizheng era, the year of *jiachen* in the cycle, on the third day of the third month (the *shangsi* festival), Zhang Li of Qingjiang, a later student, inscribed this at the *Gen* abode of Sanshan.\n\n*Inner Chapters on the Diagrams of the Yi Images, Volume One*\n*Inner Chapters on the Diagrams of the Yi Images, Volume One*\nComposed by Zhang Li, styled Zhongchun, a later student of Qingjiang\n\nMaster Chen of Xiyi’s *Preface to the Dragon Diagram* states:\nNow, the dragon-horse first bore the Diagram, emerging in the age of Fuxi, prior to high antiquity. Even the extant, already-combined positions are met with skepticism—how much more so the numbers before their combination? Yet how is this known? The answer lies in Confucius’s threefold exposition of the nine hexagrams, through which their purport is discerned. Moreover, the celestial images hang as if strung like pearls; the slightest deviation would disrupt their order. Thus, from one to ten thousand, all are arrayed as if threaded upon a single strand.\n\nIf the *Dragon Diagram* were already combined, the sages would not have perceived its images. Therefore, Heaven’s intent first revealed its images in an uncombined state, so that the sages might observe the images and comprehend their use. The *Dragon Diagram* was scattered by Heaven to display its forms, combined by Fuxi to employ them, and silently shaped by Confucius. Initially, the *Dragon Diagram* was uncombined: the fifty-five numbers, with twenty-five above as the numbers of heaven, the central passage of three, five, and nine, and the outer enclosure of fifteen, exhausting the heavenly three, five, and nine, along with the positions of ten and five. Later, the positions of one and six were absent, while the functions of two, ten, and four were manifest—this is what is meant by \"Heaven hanging its images.\" The thirty below are the numbers of earth, also divided into five positions, all elucidating the function of five. Divided into six, they form the image of earth. Further divided into four images, earth’s six does not pair. Above, one does not pair, forming two, ten, and four; below, six is unused, also forming two, ten, and four. After combination: Heaven’s one resides above as the origin of the Dao; Earth’s six resides below as the root of vessels. Three revolves through Earth’s two and four to fulfill their function.\n\n**Annotation:** *San* (three) combines the heavenly numbers one and three to make nine, which is the \"nine used by *Qian*’s primordial yang.\"\n\nTwo combines the earthly numbers two and four to make six—this is what is meant by \"*Kun*’s primordial six in use.\"\n\nWhen three resides in yang, it avoids solitary yin; when in yin, it avoids orphaned yang.\n**Annotation:** The eight trigrams are formed by three positions. Above, one, three, and five constitute three positions, while two and four, lacking central equilibrium, cannot form trigrams and become solitary yin. Below, six, eight, and ten constitute three positions, while seven and nine, lacking central equilibrium, cannot form trigrams and become orphaned yang. Three avoids both, as if in retreat.\n\nHow vast and wondrous are the transformations of the *Dragon Diagram*, branching into myriad paths! Here, I briefly outline its general principles.\n\nConfucius silently arranged three presentations of the nine trigrams:\n*The Treading* (*Lü*) is the foundation of virtue.\nThe sequence of trigrams follows ten, clarifying the use of ten and instructing people in distinguishing above and below.\n*The Humility* (*Qian*) is the handle of virtue.\nNext follows fifteen, clarifying the use of fifteen and instructing people in diminishing the many to augment the few.\n*The Return* (*Fu*) is the root of virtue.\nNext follows twenty-four trigrams, marking the beginning of qi’s transformation.\n*The Constancy* (*Heng*) is the firmness of virtue.\nThe lower classic’s sequence of two trigrams marks the beginning of form’s transformation.\n*The Decrease* (*Sun*) is the cultivation of virtue.\n*The Increase* (*Yi*) is the abundance of virtue.\nThese two trigrams instruct people in the origins of prosperity and decline.\n*The Distress* (*Kun*) is the discernment of virtue.\n*The Well* (*Jing*) is the domain of virtue.\nThese two trigrams instruct people in the principle of transition and communication.\n*The Gentle* (*Xun*) is the regulation of virtue.\n*Xun* enacts authority. Authority is the great function of the sage—adapting to circumstances, responding to the times, and embracing change.\n\n**Diagram One: The Numbers of the *Dragon Diagram* Before Heaven and Earth Combine**\nThe upper position represents the heavenly numbers. The heavenly numbers center on five, divided into five positions: five times five makes twenty-five. Summing one, three, five, and seven also yields twenty-five. The five positions vertically and horizontally reveal three; vertically and horizontally, they reveal five. The three positions vertically and horizontally reveal nine; vertically and horizontally, they reveal fifteen. The *Sequence* speaks of three, five, and nine running through the center, enveloped by fifteen—this is the meaning.\n\nThe lower position represents the earthly numbers. The earthly numbers center on six, also divided into five positions: five times six makes thirty. Summing two, four, six, eight, and ten also yields thirty. The *Sequence* speaks of \"dividing ten to make six, forming the image of earth\"—this is the meaning.\n\n**Diagram Two: The Positions of the *Dragon Diagram* After Heaven and Earth Combine**\nThe upper position represents images. Combining one, three, and five forms \"three for heaven\"; pairing four forms \"two for earth.\" Their sum is fifteen—the generative numbers of the five phases. This corresponds to the upper five positions of the previous image: subtracting four from the upper five yields one; subtracting three from the lower five yields two; subtracting two from the right five yields three; subtracting one from the left five yields four; only the central five remains unchanged. The *Sequence* speaks of \"Heaven’s one residing above as the origin of the Dao\"—this is the meaning.\n\nAccording to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars*: \"Combining the two beginnings defines hardness and softness.\" One is the beginning of yang; two is the beginning of yin. Here, in this diagram, the upper \"heaven\" (一) is the image of one; the lower \"earth\" (六) is the image of two; the central \"heaven\" (五) represents the four images and five phases. The upper left (一○) is *great yang*, the image of fire; the upper right (一。) is *lesser yin*, the image of metal; the lower left (一。) is *lesser yang*, the image of wood; the lower right (一○) is *great yin*, the image of water. Earth’s *qi* resides centrally as the harmonizing force, circulating the four directions, propagating the beginning and extending life—it is both yin and yang. The three on the right represent the three powers, the basis of trigram lines; the four on the left represent the four seasons, the basis of yarrow-stalk divination. Thus, the upper images of one, two, three, and four are the essence of yarrow numbers and hexagram lines.\n\nThe lower position represents forms: nine, eight, seven, and six are the flourishing numbers of metal, wood, fire, and water; the central ten is the completed number of earth. This corresponds to the lower five positions of the previous image, where the central six is divided: placing one atop six forms seven; placing two to the left of six forms eight; placing three to the right of six forms nine; only the lower six remains unpaired as six. The *Sequence* speaks of \"dividing six to form the four images, with earth’s six unpaired\"—this is the meaning.\n\nNote: Seven is the roundness of yarrow stalks—seven times seven makes forty-nine. Eight is the squareness of trigrams—eight times eight makes sixty-four. Nine is the function of yang—yang lines number one hundred ninety-two. Six is the function of yin—yin lines also number one hundred ninety-two. Ten is the number of the *Great Expansion*—multiplying five by ten or ten by five both yield fifty. Thus, the lower forms of six, seven, eight, and nine are the functions of yarrow numbers and hexagram lines.\n\nThe upper is the essence, the lower the function; the upper is the image, the lower the form. Images move, forms are still; essence is established, function is enacted—and thus the workings of creation are inexhaustible.\n\nObserve: one, two, three, and four are the images of heaven, transforming above; six, seven, eight, and nine are the forms of earth, taking shape below. When above and below are layered, they form the five phases—this is the arrangement of left and right, front and back, generation and completion. When above and below intersect, they form the eight trigrams—this is the arrangement of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, the nine palaces. Comparing the previous and subsequent diagrams, it should resemble the *Taiyi Dunjia*’s yin and yang dual-configuration charts. One, two, three, and four are like the *Dunjia*’s heavenly plate above, revolving with the seasons; six, seven, eight, and nine are like the *Dunjia*’s earthly plate below, fixed and unchanging—this clarifies the principle of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness. Yet none of the earlier scholars have elucidated this intent. Thus, one begins in the south, initiating the method of heavenly images, moving and turning to the right.\n\nAt the first intersection, one resides in the southeast, two in the northwest, three in the southwest, and four in the northeast—four yang numbers arrayed above to the right, four yin numbers arrayed below to the left, dividing yin and yang so that heaven and earth assume their positions.\n\nAt the second intersection:\n*(Diagram omitted—Right Dragon Chart of heaven and earth’s uncombined numbers.)*\nThe upper position represents the numbers of heaven. The heavenly numbers center on five, dividing into five positions. Five fives make twenty-five, and the accumulation of one, three, five, and seven also yields twenty-five. In the five positions, three appears vertically and horizontally; in the three positions, nine appears vertically and horizontally, and fifteen appears vertically and horizontally. This is what the *Sequence* means by \"three, five, and nine threaded through the center, fifteen encompassing the exterior.\"\n\nThe lower position represents the numbers of earth. The earthly numbers center on six, also dividing into five positions. Five sixes make thirty in total, and the accumulation of two, four, six, eight, and ten also yields thirty. This is what the *Sequence* means by \"dividing ten to form six, shaping the image of earth.\"\n\n*(Diagram omitted—Right Dragon Chart of heaven and earth’s combined positions.)*\nThe upper position represents images. Combining one, three, and five forms \"participating in heaven,\" while four, being even, forms \"pairing with earth.\" Their sum totals fifteen, the generating numbers of the Five Phases. From the five positions in the previous image: the upper five minus four yields one, the lower five minus three yields two, the right five minus two yields three, and the left five minus one yields four—only the central five remains unmoved. This is what the *Sequence* means by \"Heavenly One resides above, serving as the origin of the Dao.\"\n\nAccording to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendrics*: \"Combining the two beginnings establishes firmness and softness.\" One is the beginning of yang; two is the beginning of yin. In this diagram, the upper \"heaven\" represents the image of one; the lower \"earth\" represents the image of two; the central \"heaven\" represents the Four Images and Five Phases. The upper left (one ○) is Greater Yang, the image of fire; the upper right (one •) is Lesser Yin, the image of metal; the lower left (one •) is Lesser Yang, the image of wood; the lower right (one ○) is Greater Yin, the image of water. Earth, as the balanced qi residing in the center, circulates to the four directions, initiating and propagating generation—it is both yin and yang. The three on the right represent the image of the Three Powers, the basis for drawing the trigrams; the four on the left represent the image of the Four Seasons, the basis for the milfoil’s division into four. Thus, the upper images of one, two, three, and four are the essence of the milfoil’s numbers, hexagrams, and lines.\n\nThe lower position represents forms: nine, eight, seven, and six are the full numbers of metal, wood, fire, and water; the central ten appearing in earth is the completing number of soil. From the five positions in the previous image, the central six is divided: placing one above six forms seven, placing two to the left of six forms eight, placing three to the right of six forms nine, while the lower six remains unpaired, standing alone as six. This is what the *Sequence* means by \"dividing six to form the Four Images, with earth’s six remaining unpaired.\"\n\nNote: Seven is the milfoil’s roundness, seven sevens making forty-nine; eight is the hexagram’s squareness, eight eights making sixty-four; nine is the function of yang, with yang lines totaling one hundred ninety-two; six is the function of yin, with yin lines also totaling one hundred ninety-two; ten is the number of the Great Expansion, five multiplied by ten or ten multiplied by five, both yielding fifty. Thus, the lower forms of six, seven, eight, and nine are the application of the milfoil’s numbers, hexagrams, and lines.\n\nThe upper is the essence, the lower the function; the upper is the image, the lower the form. Images move, forms are still; essence is established, function is enacted—thus the workings of creation are inexhaustible.\n\nNote: One, two, three, and four are the images of heaven, transforming above; six, seven, eight, and nine are the forms of earth, taking shape below. When above and below intersect, they form the Five Phases—this is the arrangement of left and right, front and back, generation and completion. When above and below interact, they form the eight trigrams—this is the arrangement of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, the nine palaces. Comparing the previous and subsequent diagrams, it should resemble the *Taiyi Dunjia*’s yin and yang dual-configuration charts. One, two, three, and four are like the *Dunjia*’s heavenly plate above, revolving with the seasons; six, seven, eight, and nine are like the *Dunjia*’s earthly plate below, fixed and unchanging—this clarifies the principle of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness. Yet none of the earlier scholars have elucidated this intent. Thus, one begins in the south, initiating the method of heavenly images, moving and turning to the right.\n\nAt the first intersection, one resides in the southeast, two in the northwest, three in the southwest, and four in the northeast—four yang numbers arrayed above to the right, four yin numbers arrayed below to the left, dividing yin and yang so that heaven and earth assume their positions. At the second intersection, one resides in the northeast, two in the southwest, three in the southeast, and four in the northwest—thus the female and male interlock, giving rise to the six child trigrams, and combining these two transformations forms the natural images of the Former Heaven eight trigrams. Then, by doubling to form the positions of generation and completion, one-six, two-seven, three-eight, and four-nine pair yin and yang respectively—this is the diagram described by Master Shao and Master Zhu.\n\nAt the third intersection, one resides in the northwest, two in the southeast, three in the northeast, and four in the southwest—thus firmness and softness intermingle, forming Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui. At the fourth intersection, one resides in the southwest, two in the northeast, three in the northwest, and four in the southeast—thus yang is to the right and yin to the left, with Qian and Kun arrayed in order, and combining these two transformations forms the cultivated positions of the Later Heaven eight trigrams. With another turn, one returns to the south. This is what the *Great Commentary* means by \"alternating threes and fives, interweaving their numbers.\"\n\nLiu Yinyun states: The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the eight trigrams and nine sections serve as outer and inner. Such is their significance.\n\nJiang Shiwen of Hetian remarks: The *River Diagram*’s completed numbers lie below, symbolizing the earth and its immobility, while the generative numbers symbolize the heavens’ movement, forming the trigrams. The Former Heaven eight trigrams represent natural images, and the Later Heaven eight trigrams represent cultivated positions. Observe the first intersection: the Two Modes emerge; the second intersection: the Six Children are born; the third intersection: Zhen and Dui face each other while Kan and Li mutually reside; the fourth intersection: Qian and Kun array in order while Gen and Xun occupy the corners. The sage elevates Li to the south and descends Kan to the north, thus rectifying the four directions’ positions. Placing Qian in the northwest and retiring Kun to the southwest clarifies the principle of the eldest daughter succeeding the mother. Thus, the Former Heaven reveals natural images, and the Later Heaven reveals cultivated positions—this is most evident. Though his explanation does not derive from earlier Confucians, the images and numbers are arrayed, and the principles and patterns shine forth, making it no hindrance to stand as an independent school of thought.\n\nMaster Zhu once said: In idle moments, it is good to contemplate the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, for one may thereby achieve a flowing, dynamic understanding. Now, observing Zhongchun’s explanation, I am all the more convinced.\n\n**Diagram Three: Right—*Dragon Diagram* of Heaven-and-Earth’s Generative Numbers**\nThis is the preceding diagram.\nOne, two, three, four symbolize heaven and move in a rightward rotation; six, seven, eight, nine embody earth and remain still in their proper positions. Thus, with the first turn, one resides in the north and pairs with six; the second turn, two resides in the south and pairs with seven; the third turn, three resides in the east and pairs with eight; the fourth turn, four resides in the west and pairs with nine. Fifty resides at the center, serving as the pivot of heaven-and-earth’s movement. What the *Great Commentary* means by \"interweaving their numbers\" refers precisely to this. \"Interweaving\" (*cuo*) means crossing and mutual exchange—left and right, three and four alternating. \"Interlacing\" (*zong*) means gathering and lifting—low and high, one and two ascending and descending. Viewing this in two layers reveals the clarity of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness, the meaning of above and below.\n\n**Diagram Four: Right—*Luo Writing* of Heaven-and-Earth’s Intersecting Numbers**\nYang Ziyun said: One and six share a common origin; two and seven form companions; three and eight are friends; four and nine follow the same path; five and five remain steadfast. This refers precisely to this diagram. Master Zhu said: Separating the unions of six, seven, eight, and nine forms Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, which occupy the four cardinal positions; following the sequence of one, two, three, and four forms Gen, Dui, Zhen, and Xun, filling the four corners’ vacancies—this aligns with these numbers. Examining the images of generation and completion, observing their divisions and unions, advances and retreats, intersections and movements, stillness and activity, it is evident that this is the image of intersecting numbers. The *Great Commentary*’s \"great expansion number fifty, whose use is forty-nine,\" the division of milfoil stalks, the formation of hexagrams, the counting and returning of the four images—seven, eight, nine, six—all imitate this.\n\n**Diagram Five: Right—*Luo Writing*’s Vertical and Horizontal Fifteen**\nThe *Hong Fan* begins: First, the Five Phases; second, reverently employing the Five Affairs; third, agriculturally employing the Eight Governances; fourth, harmoniously employing the Five Regulations; fifth, establishing the Imperial Standard; sixth, employing the Three Virtues; seventh, clearly employing divination; eighth, attentively employing the Myriad Portents; ninth, encouraging the Five Blessings and employing the Six Calamities. Han scholars took these sixty-five characters as the original text of the *Luo Writing*, while [Chen] Tuan’s transmission regarded them as the *Dragon Diagram*’s three transformations, taking the Generative-Completion Diagram as the *Luo Writing*’s original text. This likely arose from doubts about transcription errors, sparking debates over whether the diagram had nine or the writing had ten. Now, exchanging the names of these two images clarifies the *Dragon Diagram* and *Tortoise Writing* without need for further discussion.\n\nThe *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"The River yields the Diagram; the Luo yields the Writing; the sage takes them as models.\" Kong Anguo said: The *River Diagram* refers to when Fuxi ruled all under heaven, a dragon-horse emerged from the River, and he took its markings to draw the eight trigrams. The *Luo Writing* refers to when Yu controlled the floods, a divine tortoise bore markings on its back, with numbers up to nine, and Yu arranged them accordingly to form the Nine Categories. Liu Xin said: Fuxi succeeded heaven to rule and received the *River Diagram*, from which he drew the eight trigrams. Yu, while controlling the floods, was granted the *Luo Writing* and modeled it to array the Nine Divisions. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the eight trigrams and nine sections serve as outer and inner.\n\nGuan Ziming said: The *River Diagram*’s markings have seven in front and six behind, eight to the left and nine to the right. The *Luo Writing*’s markings have nine in front and one behind, three to the left and seven to the right; four in front to the left, two in front to the right, eight behind to the left, six behind to the right.\n\nMaster Shao said: The circular represents the stars. Do the numbers of calendrical records originate here? The calendar combines the two beginnings to determine firmness and softness, the two middles to establish pitch standards and calendars, and the two ends to record intercalary remainders—this is what is meant by calendrical records. The square represents the earth. Do the methods of drawing provinces and well-fields imitate this? Provinces have nine wells and nine hundred *mu*—this is what is meant by drawing provinces and well-fields. The circular belongs to the *River Diagram*’s numbers; the square belongs to the *Luo Writing*’s markings. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen followed them to create the *Book of Changes*, while Yu and Jishu modeled them to compose the *Hong Fan*.\n\nHeaven one, earth two; heaven three, earth four; heaven five, earth six; heaven seven, earth eight; heaven nine, earth ten. Heaven’s numbers are five; earth’s numbers are five. The five positions mutually correspond, each having its union. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five; earth’s numbers total thirty. Altogether, heaven-and-earth’s numbers are fifty-five.\n\nThis is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits’ workings are enacted. This passage serves to elucidate the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*.\n\nAll odd numbers pertain to yang, and yang is the number of Heaven; all even numbers pertain to yin, and yin is the number of Earth. Heaven’s numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—sum to twenty-five; Earth’s numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—sum to thirty. Combined, these yield fifty-five, and all the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the contractions and expansions of yin and yang, are encompassed within this number.\n\nThis number, when doubled, becomes the Two Modes; when triplicated, the Three Powers; when quintupled, the Five Phases; when divided, the Eight Trigrams; when exhaustively examined, the Nine Palaces—these are its essential applications.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Between Heaven and Earth, there is only qi. When divided into two, it becomes yin and yang, and the Five Phases’ transformations, the beginnings and endings of the myriad things, are all governed thereby.\n\nThe *Inner Canon* states: Yin and yang can be reckoned by tens, extended by hundreds; reckoned by thousands, extended by ten thousands. Though their vastness defies enumeration, when modeled by the *Changes*, nothing is omitted, nothing is obstructed, and all is penetrated. Through the interplay of threes and fives, their numbers are interwoven. By mastering their transformations, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are completed. By exhausting their numbers, the images of all under Heaven are determined. Who but the utmost in transformation could achieve this? This passage further elucidates the transformations of the *Diagram* and *Writing*.\n\n\"Tripling\" means interposing between two, as in the *Record*’s phrase \"do not stand or sit in threes.\" Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one, two, three, and four interposed among six, seven, eight, and nine. \"Quintupling\" means arranging in five positions, as in the military terms \"units of ten\" or \"formations of five.\" Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one, two, three, and four arranged among the earth of six, seven, eight, and nine.\n\n\"Interlacing\" means crossing and exchanging, as in alternating left and right. Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in three and four exchanging positions left and right. \"Weaving\" means interlinking and lifting, as in rising and falling. Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one and two rising and falling above and below.\n\nThrough tripling to transform, quintupling to transform, interlacing to exchange, and weaving to interlink, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are completed, and the images of all under Heaven are determined. Thus, are not the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* the origins of the utmost transformations under Heaven?\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, they obscurely assisted the divine luminaries to generate the milfoil stalks, weighed Heaven and Earth’s numbers to establish the calculations, observed the transformations of yin and yang to establish the trigrams, and unfolded the interplay of firm and yielding to generate the lines. They harmonized with virtue and power to order principles, and exhausted the patterns of things and the essence of natures to reach destiny. This chapter reveals the sages’ great purpose in composing the *Changes*, and the fundamental origin of the stalks’ numbers and the trigrams’ lines.\n\n\"Obscurely assisting the divine luminaries\" means that the sages purified their hearts through fasting and withdrawal, retiring into seclusion where the divine luminaries silently aided them. The forty-nine milfoil stalks were used for dividing, suspending, counting, and returning, thereby generating the yarrow stalks of yin and yang, firmness and yielding. Heaven’s and Earth’s numbers were weighed and paired to clarify the images of nine, eight, seven, and six. Thus, by observing the transformations of Heaven’s yin and yang, the trigrams’ images were established; by unfolding the interplay of Earth’s firmness and yielding, the lines’ meanings were generated. By harmonizing with virtue and power, each principle was appropriately ordered. By exhausting the patterns of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, firmness and yielding, and fulfilling their own natures to fulfill the natures of all things, they could assist Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturing and merge without gap with the flowing workings of creation—this was the utmost achievement of the sages’ perfect sincerity.\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, they sought to accord with the principles of nature and destiny. Thus, they established Heaven’s Dao as yin and yang, Earth’s Dao as yielding and firm, and humanity’s Dao as benevolence and righteousness. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Changes* formed trigrams with six lines. Dividing yin and yang and alternately employing yielding and firm, the *Changes* composed hexagrams with six positions.\n\nThe sages composed the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and destiny, primarily for the sake of humanity. Thus, by observing yin and yang, they established Heaven’s Dao. Heaven’s Dao consists of cold and heat, day and night. By examining yielding and firm, they established Earth’s Dao. Earth’s Dao consists of flowing and standing, growth and vegetation. By grounding in benevolence and righteousness, they established humanity’s Dao. Humanity’s Dao consists of filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness.\n\nHumanity receives the qi of yin and yang to possess life, is endowed with the qualities of firmness and yielding to possess form, and is imbued with the principles of benevolence and righteousness to complete its nature. With qi, form, and qualities fully possessed and nature complete, the Dao of the Three Powers is perfected. Thus, in the Eight Trigrams, the first line represents Earth, the middle Humanity, and the top Heaven, each differing in odd and even, combining the Three Powers and doubling them. In the hexagrams, the first and second lines represent Earth, the third and fourth Humanity, and the fifth and top Heaven. Separately considered, the first, third, and fifth positions are yang, while the second, fourth, and top are yin. Yang is firm, yin is yielding; yin and yang, firmness and yielding, alternately employed within a hexagram’s six lines, interweave to form its patterns.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* is vast and all-encompassing. It contains the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them yields six; these six are none other than the Dao of the Three Powers. The Dao undergoes changes and movements, hence the term \"lines.\" Lines have ranks, hence the term \"things.\" Things intermingle, hence the term \"patterns.\" When patterns are inappropriate, fortune and misfortune arise.\n\nThe Dao is the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Heaven’s alternation of yin and yang gives rise to five, while Earth’s alternation of yielding and firm gives rise to ten. When five and ten are doubled, they form the lines—this is what is meant by \"change and movement.\" The lines are what imitate this; the lines are what imitate the movements of all under Heaven. \"Ranks\" refer to gradations. The character for \"rank\" (等) is composed of \"bamboo\" (竹), signifying counting rods, and \"ten\" (十) with \"one\" (一), marking the beginning and end of numbers. To calculate without holding the rods is the meaning of \"pointing to the matter\" (指事). An old interpretation derives \"rank\" from \"equal\" (等), but this offers no meaningful insight, so it is here corrected.\n\nThe lines’ activity and stillness possess ranks—first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top—and distinctions of seven, eight, nine, and six, hence the term \"things.\" \"Things\" are temporal entities. Seven and nine are odd, and all things that are yang, whose substance is firm, belong to *Qian*’s domain. Six and eight are even, and all things that are yin, whose substance is yielding, belong to *Kun*’s domain. Separately considered, nine is yang and six is yin; seven is firm and eight is yielding. Yin and yang are images; firmness and yielding are forms. Thus, nine and six change, while seven and eight do not—lines employ nine and six to emphasize change. It is also said: the milfoil number is seven, the trigrams number eight. The bodies of firmness and yielding establish *Qian*’s lines as nine and *Kun*’s lines as six, through which the functions of yin and yang operate. Yin and yang unite in virtue, firmness and yielding possess form, interweaving to create patterns. \"Patterns\" (文) are the warp and weft of culture. The character for \"pattern\" (文) derives from the crossing of lines (×), an image of yin and yang intersecting.\n\nWhen patterns are appropriate, fortune arises: to dwell in correctness, to move with moderation, is to align with the fittingness of things, and thus fortune is born. The character for \"fortune\" (吉) is composed of \"ten\" (十), signifying yin transforming into yang, and \"mouth\" (口), signifying yang transforming into yin. The phonetic element \"one\" (一) resides within change and movement; when change attains correctness, it becomes fortune—this is the meaning of the compound. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"Virtue, when it moves but once, is without exception fortunate.\" The *Commentary* states: \"All movements under Heaven are steadfast in the One.\" Wang Luzhai of Jinhua interpreted the character for \"fortune\" as the image of old yang emerging from the earth.\n\nWhen patterns are inappropriate, misfortune arises: to dwell without moderation, to move without correctness, is to fall into pits and traps, and thus misfortune is born. The character for \"misfortune\" (凶) is composed of \"pit\" (㐫), signifying movement, and \"mouth\" (口), signifying movement that falls into the pit, losing its central correctness and becoming misfortune. \"Pit\" (㐫) is a trap—this is the meaning of the compound. Wang Luzhai of Jinhua interpreted the character for \"misfortune\" as the image of old yin entering the earth. Thus it is said: fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse arise from movement.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram Explanations, Inner Chapters, Volume One (concluded)**\n\n**Diagram Explanations, Inner Chapters, Volume Two**\n*Composed by Zhang Lizhong, a later scholar of Qingjiang*\n\n**Original Trigram Drawing 1**\n*Right: The Image of the Supreme Ultimate Giving Birth to the Two Modes*\nThe *Book of Changes* originally had neither *Qian* nor *Kun*, only this single line (一). When the Supreme Ultimate divided, the light and pure qi floated upward to become Heaven, while the heavy and turbid qi congealed downward to become Earth. The Sage looked up and observed, looked down and examined, received the *River Diagram*, and accordingly drew the trigrams: representing Heaven (○) with a single unbroken line (一), and Earth (一) with a single broken line (一). The unbroken line was named \"odd\" and designated yang; the broken line was named \"even\" and designated yin. This arrangement—odd above and even below—is the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. The central five is the intersection of Heaven and Earth’s qi, the root of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and the transformation and generation of the myriad things. As the *Record of Music* states: \"One movement and one stillness—such is the space between Heaven and Earth.\" Master Zhou said: \"The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, stillness arises. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, movement resumes. Movement and stillness alternate as each other’s root. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.\"\n\n**Original Trigram Drawing 2**\n*Right: The Image of the Two Modes Giving Birth to the Four Images*\nThe *Book of Changes* originally had no Eight Trigrams, only this *Qian* and *Kun*. Master Zhu said: The yang mode generates an odd line to form Greater Yang, and an even line to form Lesser Yin. The yin mode generates an odd line to form Lesser Yang, and an even line to form Greater Yin. In the old diagram, the Four Images were arranged evenly, endlessly generating. In the present diagram, the yang mode generates one odd and one even line below, forming yin and yang; the yin mode generates one odd and one even line above, forming firmness and yielding. The Four Images revolve in a circle, endlessly cycling. Firmness intersects with yin, yin with firmness; yang intersects with yielding, yielding with yang. Above and below, left and right intersect, and the myriad things are born. Master Zhou said: \"Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The five qi are distributed in order, and the four seasons proceed.\" The *Commentary* states: \"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as yielding and firm.\" This is what is meant.\n\n*Right: The Two Modes Giving Birth to the Four Images*\nThe yin mode generates an odd line above, forming Lesser Yang. Lesser Yang is yang within yin. The yang qi of the east generates things; in terms of time, it is spring. \"Spring\" (春) means \"stirring\" (蠢): things stir and come to life, thus enabling movement, hence it is centered on the compass. In Heaven it is wind, on Earth it is wood, above it is Jupiter, in virtue it is *yuan* (origin). *Yuan* is the chief of goodness. In the body it is the sinews, in the organs it is the liver, and it connects to the eyes.\n\nIn disposition it is anger; its sound is shouting; its color is green; its flavor is sour; its note is *jiao* (角); its livestock is the chicken; its grain is wheat; its number is three, the generative number of wood.\n\nThe yang mode generates an odd line below, forming Greater Yang. Greater Yang is yang within yang. The yang qi of the south nurtures things; in terms of time, it is summer. \"Summer\" (夏) means \"greatness\" (假): things grow great and thus flourish evenly, hence it is centered on the balance. In Heaven it is heat, on Earth it is fire, above it is Mars, in virtue it is *heng* (prosperity). *Heng* is the gathering of excellence. In the body it is the vessels, in the organs it is the heart, and it connects to the tongue. In disposition it is joy; its sound is laughter; its color is red; its flavor is bitter; its note is *zhi* (征); its livestock is the sheep; its grain is millet; its number is seven, the consummate number of fire.\n\nThe yang mode generates an even line below, forming Lesser Yin. Lesser Yin is yin within yang. The yin qi of the west gathers things; in terms of time, it is autumn. \"Autumn\" (秋) means \"yielding\" (让): things yield and gather thus enabling maturity, hence it is centered on the square. In Heaven it is dryness, on Earth it is metal, above it is Venus, in virtue it is *li* (benefit). *Li* is the harmony of righteousness. In the body it is the skin and hair, in the organs it is the lungs, and it connects to the nose. In disposition it is sorrow; its sound is weeping; its color is white; its flavor is acrid; its note is *shang* (商); its livestock is the horse; its grain is rice; its number is four, the generative number of metal.\n\nThe yin mode generates an even line above, forming Greater Yin. Greater Yin is yin within yin. The yin qi of the north conceals things; in terms of time, it is winter. \"Winter\" (冬) means \"end\" (终): things end and conceal thus enabling completion, hence it is centered on the weight. In Heaven it is cold, on Earth it is water, above it is Mercury, in virtue it is *zhen* (integrity). *Zhen* is the trunk of affairs. In the body it is the bones, in the organs it is the kidneys, and it connects to the ears. In disposition it is fear; its sound is groaning; its color is black; its flavor is salty; its note is *yu* (羽); its livestock is the pig; its grain is beans; its number is six, the consummate number of water.\n\nThe center is the midst of yin and yang, the interior of the four directions. With warp and weft intersecting, it can thus be upright and straight, hence it is centered on the plumb line. In terms of time, it is the four seasons. In Heaven it is dampness, on Earth it is soil, above it is Saturn, in virtue it is *cheng* (sincerity). Master Zhou said: \"*Yuan heng* (origin and prosperity) are the penetration of sincerity; *li zhen* (benefit and integrity) are the return of sincerity.\" In the body it is the flesh, in the organs it is the spleen, and it connects to the mouth. In disposition it is thought; its sound is singing; its color is yellow; its flavor is sweet; its note is *gong* (宫); its livestock is the ox; its grain is millet; its number is five, the generative number of soil.\n\n*Trigram lines: three*\n*Right: The Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nThe *Yi* originally had sixty-four hexagrams, but only these eight trigrams. In ancient times, when Fuxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the images in Heaven and looked down to observe the patterns on Earth. He examined the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, taking from his own body and from distant things. Thereupon he first created the eight trigrams to communicate with the virtue of the numinous and to categorize the conditions of the myriad things. Between Heaven and Earth, there was originally the character \"Heaven\" (天).\n\n*Right: The Reason the Sage Created the Trigrams*\nThe *Yi* has the Supreme Polarity, which gives birth to the Two Modes; the Two Modes give birth to the Four Images; the Four Images give birth to the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give birth to great undertakings.\n\n*Right: The Purpose of the Sage in Drawing the Trigrams*\nThe Four Images: when yang descends to interact with yielding and yielding ascends to interact with yang, they form *Qian* and *Kun* (Heaven and Earth in their positions), *Gen* and *Dui* (Mountain and Marsh communicating qi). When firm ascends to interact with yin and yin descends to interact with firm, they form *Zhen* and *Xun* (Thunder and Wind clashing), *Kan* and *Li* (Water and Fire not overcoming each other). Heaven holds yang, suspending the sun and stars—*Li* as the sun, *Dui* as the stars. In Heaven, one looks up and observes in reverse, thus *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*—the four images of Heaven—are generated from above downward. Earth holds yin, opening mountains and rivers—*Gen* as mountains, *Kan* as rivers. On Earth, one looks down and observes in sequence, thus *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun*—the four images of Earth—are generated from below upward. The eight trigrams intermingle: those above interact to the left, those below interact to the right, so that *Qian* is south and *Kun* is north, *Li* is east and *Kan* is west, and the image of the circular diagram of the Earlier Heaven Eight Trigrams is revealed. When *Zhen* and *Gen* observe each other, reversing *Zhen* makes *Gen* and reversing *Gen* makes *Zhen*, then *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* occupy the corners, while *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* occupy the center, and the image of the square diagram of the Later Heaven Eight Trigrams is revealed. Thereupon, movement and stillness mutually support each other, earlier and later intermingle, circular and square alternate in function, and the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation cannot be fully expressed.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents\" (see the Four Images Diagram); \"*Fu* and *Gou* are the small parents\" (see the Eight Trigrams Diagram). The *Yi* is rooted in *Qian* and *Kun* yet born from *Gou* and *Fu*. For when firm interacts with yielding, it becomes *Fu*; when yielding interacts with firm, it becomes *Gou*. From this, it is inexhaustible. He also said: \"Among the images of the eight trigrams, four do not change—*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*; two reverse—*Zhen* reverses to become *Gen*, *Dui* reverses to become *Xun*—thus six change to form eight.\"\n\n*Trigram lines: four*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nThe yang mode above interacts to the left, the yin mode below interacts to the right, and thus this diagram is formed. Master Kangjie said: \"Kun in the north, Qian in the south, Li in the east, Kan in the west, Zhen in the northeast, Dui in the southeast, Xun in the southwest, Gen in the northwest\" refers to this. The circle (○) in the center is the Supreme Polarity; the two (--) are the Two Modes. The previous images determine the positions of odd and even lines by the above and below of Heaven and Earth, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams, all converging at the center. This is what is meant by \"gathering them does not fill a fist, yet the ten thousand differences share one root.\"\n\nThis diagram arranges the gates of yin and yang to the left and right, extending outward through movement and stillness, the four seasons, and the eight directions—what is meant by \"when released, it fills the Six Harmonies; one root yet ten thousand differences.\" The *Tang Gao* states: \"Only the August Supreme Diety bestows the centered nature upon the people below, as if there were a constant nature.\" Master Liu said: \"The people receive the center of Heaven and Earth to live.\" Confucius said: \"Of the natures endowed by Heaven and Earth, humanity is the most noble.\" Master Zisi said: \"What Heaven decrees is called nature.\" The center, nature—these are what Heaven has granted to me. Examining the *Diagram of Generation and Completion*, one sees that Heaven and Earth, the Four Images, the Eight Trigrams, and the myriad things are all complete within me. What Master Cheng called \"the naturally inherent center,\" what Mencius called \"all things complete within me,\" what Master Zeng called \"loyalty,\" and what the Master called \"oneness\"—their principles do not lie beyond this. The *Xiantian Diagram* proceeds from one to two, from two to four, from four to eight, and by extension to the boundless hundreds, thousands, and myriads. What the earlier Confucians called \"the mind as the Supreme Polarity, containing all principles and responding to all affairs,\" what Mencius called \"striving to practice reciprocity,\" what Master Zeng called \"reciprocity,\" and what the Master called \"pervading\"—their Dao likewise does not lie beyond this. Scholars who empty their minds to contemplate this, turn inward to embody it, truly perceive this principle, and truly attain this Way, will silently accomplish it. Then the subtleties of virtue, power, nature, and destiny, and the origins of ritual, music, punishment, and governance—none transcend this.\n\n*Trigram lines: five*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nWhen the four central trigrams are viewed in reverse, they become Zhen, Dui, Kan, and Li; when the four peripheral trigrams are viewed directly, they become Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun. Thus, in this image, Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui occupy the cardinal directions, while Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun reside in the four corners. Comparing this to the *Hetu*: one and six dwell in the north as water, and Kan corresponds to it—Kan is water. Two and seven dwell in the south as fire, and Li corresponds to it—Li is fire. Three and eight dwell in the east as wood, and Zhen corresponds to it—Zhen is thunder, active in spring. Four and nine dwell in the west as metal, and Dui corresponds to it—Dui is marsh, observed in autumn. Qian is cold and ice, positioned in the northwest, adjoining Dui as metal. Xun is rising and wind, positioned in the southeast, adjoining Zhen as wood. Five and ten dwell in the center as earth, and Kun (earth) and Gen (mountain) are assigned to it. Kun is yin, so by analogy it retreats to the southwest; Gen is yang, so by analogy it is established in the northeast. This is how the positions of the *houtian* Eight Trigrams are determined. Thus, harmonizing with celestial timing, verifying with terrestrial advantage, and examining human affairs, the sequence of the four qi’s movements can be known. The *Shuo Gua* states: \"Gen is where the myriad things complete their end and begin their inception.\" Things cannot be without a ruler, so the Di emerges from Zhen. Zhen is the east, where the sun rises. None is more fitting to hold the vessel than the eldest son; when the eldest son takes office, the eldest daughter is paired with him, hence it is followed by Xun, resembling the eldest son and his principal wife. When the household is ordered, the state is governed; from the household extending to the state, hence it is followed by Li. Li is brightness. The sage faces south to listen, and all under Heaven is greatly illuminated—this is the image of the sun at midday. When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines, hence it is followed by Kun. Kun is compliance. To exert labor in Kun is the meaning of resting from work, hence it is followed by Dui. Dui is the west, where the sun sets. Approaching dusk, one retires to rest, hence it is said: \"joyful words in Dui.\" It is then followed by Qian. Qian is yang, the northwest, the direction of yin. Yin and yang contend, hence it is said: \"strife in Qian.\" It is followed by Kan. Kan is water, the trigram of the true north; the time of midnight, the image of deep yin, hence it is said: \"toil in Kan.\" After toil comes accomplishment, hence it is said: \"completion in Gen,\" and it concludes with Gen.\n\n*Trigram lines: six*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams, with the left and right four trigrams transposed*\nQian, Li, Kan, and Kun occupy the center, resembling the head, eyes, heart, and abdomen; Zhen, Gen, Xun, and Dui occupy the left and right, resembling the hands, feet, thighs, and arms. Master Xiyi considered this a convergence of form and category. For humanity is the conjoined qi of Heaven and Earth. \"Only the August One bestows the centered nature, as if there were a constant nature.\" Thus, all who discourse on the Dao trace it to this. The *Za Gua* states: \"Qian is firm, Kun is yielding; Li above, Kan below; Dui manifests, Xun conceals; Zhen arises, Gen halts.\" Examining this, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Qian and Kun are the gates and portals of the Changes, the parents of all trigrams. Kan and Li are the enclosing frame, the axle and hub of the turning wheel. The four trigrams of the female and male are the bolts and keys.\" This, too, is derived from this. Hence, it is here set forth and transmitted.\n\n*Trigram lines: seven*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams in Cyclic Rotation*\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: \"Heaven and Earth establish their positions; mountain and marsh communicate qi; thunder and wind contend; water and fire do not oppose each other—thus the Eight Trigrams intermingle.\" \"Counting what has passed proceeds in sequence; knowing what is to come proceeds in reverse. Thus the Changes are reckoned in reverse.\" *Right: The image of the Xiantian sixty-four hexagrams in a circular diagram.* Heaven and Earth establish their positions: Qian in the south, Kun in the north. Heaven is honored above, Earth is humble below. Mountain and marsh communicate qi: mountain stabilizes the northwest, marsh pours into the southeast. Thunder and wind contend: thunder emerges in the northeast, wind flourishes in the southwest. Water and fire do not oppose each other: Li descends in the east, where the great brightness of the sun is born; Kan ascends in the west, where the lesser brightness of the moon is born.\n\nHere the discourse speaks of inner images, emphasizing stillness and the stabilization of positions. The eight trigrams intermingle—*cuo* meaning they intersect and mutually transform, alternating left and right. Qian intersects with Xun, and Xun with Qian; Kan with Dui, and Dui with Kan; Li with Gen, and Gen with Li; Kun with Zhen, and Zhen with Kun. Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen—the trigrams of the yang axis—originally occupy the left side, yet now intersect to reside above the right-side yin axis. Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun—the trigrams of the yin axis—originally occupy the right side, yet now intersect to reside above the left-side yang axis. Thus hardness and softness grind against each other, the eight trigrams surge and shift, giving rise to boundless transformation. Further elaboration appears below.\n\nHere the discourse speaks of outer images, emphasizing movement and the pursuit of timeliness. Through circular rotation and mutual impulsion, the sixty-four hexagrams take form, encircling the eight directions—just as the twenty-eight lunar lodges are distributed among the twelve earthly branches. Thus, when reckoned by moving rightward, the eight trigrams Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun proceed from inner to outer, like a ring without end.\n\n\"Counting what has passed proceeds in sequence\": *passed* refers to the hexagrams that have already transpired; *sequence* means following the order of the eight trigrams, as when one counts backward from today to previous days, or from the winter solstice to the preceding Beginning of Winter and Autumn Equinox—thus from Kun to Gen, to Kan, to Xun, to Qian, all counted in their proper sequence.\n\n\"Knowing what is to come proceeds in reverse\": *to come* refers to the hexagrams yet to arrive; *reverse* means reversing the order of the eight trigrams, as when one reckons forward from today to future days, or from the winter solstice toward the coming Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox—thus from Kun to Zhen, to Li, to Dui, to Qian, all known by reversing their sequence.\n\nYet all reckoning in the *Changes* proceeds in reverse: lines are generated from bottom to top, hexagrams are counted from right to left. Hence it is said: \"The *Changes* are reckoned in reverse.\"\n\nExamining this diagram: the Xiantian diagram is first upright, then inverted. The lower eight trigrams remain still and hold their positions, while the upper eight trigrams move and rotate rightward. Thus hardness and softness grind against each other, the eight trigrams surge and shift, one *zhen* giving rise to eight *hui*. Eight times eight make sixty-four hexagrams, intersecting left and right.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Zhen Palace: Zhen intersects with Kun, beginning with Fu, then Zhen, Shi Ke, Sui, Wu Wang, Yi, Tun, and ending with Yi, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Zhen below, Gen above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Li Palace: Li intersects with Gen, beginning with Bi, then Ming Yi, Feng, Li, Ge, Tong Ren, Jia Ren, and ending with Ji Ji, where yin and yang intermingle at the center. Li below, Kan above—three yang and three yin, day and night in equal balance.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Dui Palace: Dui intersects with Kan, beginning with Jie, then Sun, Lin, Gui Mei, Kui, Dui, Lü, and ending with Zhong Fu, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Dui below, Xun above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Qian Palace: Qian intersects with Xun, beginning with Xiao Xu, then Xu, Da Xu, Tai, Da Zhuang, Da You, Guai, and ending with Qian, reaching the extreme of the six-yang pure-body hexagram. This is the left side of the diagram.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Xun Palace: Xun intersects with Qian, beginning with Gou, then Xun, Jing, Gu, Sheng, Heng, Ding, and ending with Da Guo, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Xun below, Dui above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Kan Palace: Kan intersects with Dui, beginning with Kun, then Song, Huan, Kan, Meng, Shi, Jie, and ending with Wei Ji, where hardness and softness are evenly divided. Kan below, Li above—three hard and three soft, day and night in perfect balance.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Gen Palace: Gen intersects with Li, beginning with Lü, then Xian, Dun, Jian, Jian, Gen, Qian, and ending with Xiao Guo, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Gen below, Zhen above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Kun Palace: Kun intersects with Zhen, beginning with Yu, then Jin, Cui, Pi, Guan, Bi, Bo, and ending with Kun, completing the cycle of the six-yin pure-body hexagram. This is the right side of the diagram.\n\nViewed in a circle, the hexagrams Qian, Kun, Tai, Pi, Kan, Li, Ji Ji, Wei Ji, Sui, Gu, Jian, Gui Mei, Yi, Da Guo, Zhong Fu, and Xiao Guo—sixteen in all—alternate and oppose each other, their three positions interspersed like strung pearls or a net with its guiding cords, ordered yet not disordered. Such is the marvel of their natural arrangement, not something that human effort could contrive.\n\nThus, considering the solar terms of a year: Zhen first intersects with Kun, the hexagram of the winter solstice where one yang is born. Kun transforms into Fu, so Qian begins at the initial nine of Fu and ends at the noon position. Xun first diminishes Qian, the hexagram of the summer solstice where one yin is born. Qian transforms into Gou, so Kun begins at the initial six of Gou and ends at the midnight position. Qian and Kun establish the positions of above and below: at the winter solstice, Kun transforms, yin is abundant, cold prevails, days are shortest and nights longest; at the summer solstice, Qian transforms, yang is abundant, heat prevails, days are longest and nights shortest. The two solstices are the convergence of yin and yang. Qian and Kun intersect at the center to form Kan and Li; Kan and Li intersect to form Ji Ji and Wei Ji. Ji Ji and Wei Ji intersect at the midpoint between south and north: at the spring equinox, Ji Ji transforms into Jie, so Kan begins at the nine in the second place of Jie and ends at the west position. At the autumn equinox, Wei Ji transforms into Lü, so Li begins at the six in the second place of Lü and ends at the east position.\n\nThe three yang and three yin achieve balanced warmth and cold, with day and night in equal measure—at the spring and autumn equinoxes, yin and yang part ways. At the onset of spring, *Yi* transforms into *Bi*, where *Yi* has two yang lines externally and four yin lines internally. At the onset of summer, *Zhong Fu* transforms into *Xiao Xu*, where *Zhong Fu* has four yang lines externally and two yin lines internally. Thus, in spring and summer, yang resides externally while yin remains within—this is the time when the sage nurtures yang. At the onset of autumn, *Da Guo* transforms into *Kun*, where *Da Guo* has two yin lines externally and four yang lines internally. At the onset of winter, *Xiao Guo* transforms into *Yu*, where *Xiao Guo* has four yin lines externally and two yang lines internally. Thus, in autumn and winter, yang resides within while yin envelops externally—this is the time when the sage nurtures yin. Here, the seasonal nodes of the annual celestial cycle are fully represented in the diagram, as Shaozi (Shao Yong) meant when he spoke of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and the waxing and waning of day and night, all deriving from this.\n\nExtending this to the phases of a single month: when *Kun* is doubled, it marks the transition between the dark moon and the new moon, gradually giving rise to brightness. In *Xiao Guo*, *Zhen* is opposed by the second *Zhen*, appearing at dusk on the third day in the west at *geng*. In *Da Guo*, *Dui* is opposed by the second *Dui*, appearing as the first quarter moon on the eighth day in the south at *ding*. By the fifteenth day, the *Qian* hexagram reaches its fullness at the full moon, rising in the east at *jia*, then gradually waning. In *Zhong Fu*, *Xun* is opposed by the second *Xun*, visible at dawn on the eighteenth day in the west at *xin*. In the *Yi* hexagram, *Gen* is opposed by the second *Gen*, marking the last quarter moon on the twenty-third day directly south at *bing*. Thus, the lunar phases of the month are fully represented in the diagram, as Shaozi meant when he spoke of the dark moon, new moon, quarters, and full moon, and the waxing, waning, progression, and recession of the moon, all deriving from this.\n\nTo the northeast lies the *Gen* hexagram, where all things reach their completion and begin anew. Thus, the hexagram of the winter solstice concludes with *Gen* (Mountain Thunder *Yi*), while the node of the onset of spring begins with *Gen* (Mountain Fire *Bi*)—this is the natural order of numbers. Hence it is said: *\"The Changes correspond to heaven and earth.\"* Shaozi remarked: *\"Though the diagram bears no text, I speak all day without ever departing from it, for the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all contained within.\"* Zhu Xi said: *\"The Primordial Heaven diagram, when applied to the cycle of a year, is vast—yet even the span of 129,600 years of antiquity follows this same circle. When applied to a single day of twelve hours, it is small—yet it too follows this same circle, all beginning from *Fu* and unfolding onward.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states: *\"Heaven is noble, earth is humble—thus Qian and Kun are established. The humble and noble are arrayed in order, and the positions of the honored and base are set. Movement and stillness follow constant patterns, and the firm and yielding are determined. Things gather by kind, beings group by species—thus fortune and misfortune arise. In heaven, images take form; on earth, shapes are made manifest—thus transformations appear.\"*\n\nTherefore, the firm and yielding grind against one another, and the eight trigrams stir into motion. They are roused by thunder and lightning, moistened by wind and rain; the sun and moon move in their courses, alternating between cold and heat. The Dao of Qian gives rise to the male, and the Dao of Kun gives rise to the female.\n\n*(The above is the first chapter of the \"Great Appendix,\" elucidating the meaning of the sixty-four hexagrams in the Primordial Heaven circular diagram.)*\n\n*\"Heaven is noble, earth is humble—thus Qian and Kun are established.\"* Heaven is clear and resides above; earth is turbid and lies below. The noble above and the humble below—thus the positions of Qian and Kun are fixed. *\"The humble and noble are arrayed in order, and the positions of the honored and base are set.\"* Yang is noble, yin is humble; the ruler is honored, the minister is base. Each takes its proper place, and the ranks of the noble and base are thereby distinguished. *\"Movement and stillness follow constant patterns, and the firm and yielding are determined.\"* The external moves while the internal is still; yang moves while yin is still. Each adheres to its constant nature, and the principles of the firm and yielding are thus distinguished.\n\nThose above align with heaven, and those below align with earth. The hexagrams *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* gather in the southeast, while *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* gather in the northwest. The beings corresponding to the eight trigrams likewise follow their hexagrams in classification—horses, oxen, sheep, and pigs each form their own groups. Thus, *\"things gather by kind, beings group by species.\"*\n\nMaster He Sha Zheng said: *\"Animals belong to yang, plants belong to yin. Those that move cannot take root, for they incline toward yang. Those that take root cannot move, for they incline toward yin. The beings of yin and yang are thus grouped by these distinctions. Only humans can move upright and take root while moving, possessing the fullness of yin and yang—hence they are more spiritually endowed than other beings.\"*\n\n*Qian* is yang within yang, representing the flock of birds and beasts. *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Zhen* are yang within yin, representing the swarm of insects and fish. *Kun* is yin within yin, representing the mass of earth and stone. *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* are yin within yang, representing the cluster of grasses and trees. Yin and yang, firmness and yielding, good and evil—each gathers and separates, and thus fortune and misfortune arise.\n\nFortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss. When rain, sunshine, warmth, cold, and wind—these five—arrive in due season, it is the image of good fortune. When one is in extreme abundance and another in extreme absence, it is the image of misfortune. The gains and losses of affairs and things, and the signs of prosperity and decline, give rise to fortune and misfortune—this is no different.\n\nIn heaven, images take form: the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. On earth, shapes are made manifest: water, fire, wood, and metal. Images appear in heaven, shapes form on earth—thus the traces of transformation are revealed.\n\nThe firm and yielding grind against one another: one, seven, three, and nine are firm; two, six, four, and eight are yielding. *Mo* means to grind and polish—knowing that the grinding and turning of these numbers generate the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams stir into motion: *dang* means to shake and move, as when water washes a vessel, swirling and stirring it. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Xun*, and *Dui* interact to form the sixty-four hexagrams. They are roused by thunder and lightning—this is the image of *Zhen* and *Gen*. They are moistened by wind and rain—this is the image of *Xun* and *Dui*.\n\nThe sun and moon move in their courses—this is the image of *Kan* and *Li*. One cycle of cold and heat: when the sun travels farthest south, it is cold; when it travels nearest north, it is hot—these are the images formed by transformation. The Way of *Qian* forms the male, the Way of *Kun* forms the female—these are the shapes formed by transformation. By examining the diagrams, one grasps more than half the meaning.\n\nTo the right: the sixty-four hexagrams formed by doubling the eight trigrams.\n\n*The Explanation of the Trigrams* states: Thunder moves them, wind disperses them, rain moistens them, the sun warms them, *Gen* halts them, *Dui* delights them, *Qian* rules them, *Kun* conceals them.\n\nTo the right: the images of the sixty-four hexagrams in the *Prior Heaven* square diagram.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"All diagrams begin from the center.\"\nNow consider: \"Thunder moves them, wind disperses them\"—these occupy the center of this diagram and the four cardinal directions. \"Rain moistens them, the sun warms them\"—thus *Kan* follows *Xun*, and *Li* follows *Zhen*. \"*Gen* halts them, *Dui* delights them\"—thus *Gen* follows *Kan*, and *Dui* follows *Li*. \"*Qian* rules them, *Kun* conceals them\"—thus *Qian* follows *Dui*, and *Kun* follows *Gen*. All proceed from the center to the exterior, so left and right, above and below, vertically and horizontally, all interrelate. Thus the positions of the sixty-four hexagrams are determined.\n\nThe southeast is the yang direction, and *Qian* resides there—*Qian* is the hexagram of the fourth month, so its position is at *si*. The northwest is the yin direction, and *Kun* resides there—*Kun* is the hexagram of the tenth month, so its position is at *hai*. *Tai* is the hexagram of the first month, so its position is at *yin*. *Pi* is the hexagram of the seventh month, so its position is at *shen*. These are the four corner positions of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*.\n\nAt the winter solstice, when the yang begins to grow at *zi*, the hexagram *Fu* aligns with it—*Fu* is the hexagram of the eleventh month. At the summer solstice, when the yin begins to grow at *wu*, the hexagram *Gou* aligns with it—*Gou* is the hexagram of the fifth month. At the spring equinox, at *mao*, the hexagram *Da Zhuang* corresponds to the second month. At the autumn equinox, at *you*, the hexagram *Guan* corresponds to the eighth month. These are the four cardinal positions of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.\n\nThe months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* have hexagrams that reside in the corners, attached to the four cardinal directions. *Lin*, the hexagram of the twelfth month, pairs with *Tai*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, it is at *chou*. *Yin* receives *Gen*, so its position is in the northeast. *Guai*, the hexagram of the third month, is close to *Qian*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *chen* and *si* receive *Xun*, and their position is in the southeast. *Dun*, the hexagram of the sixth month, is near *Pi*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *wei* and *shen* receive *Kun*, and their position is in the southwest. *Bo*, the hexagram of the ninth month, neighbors *Kun*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *xu* and *hai* receive *Qian*, and their position is in the northwest, corresponding to the earth’s directions.\n\nIf one observes with *Qian* above and *Kun* below, the eight trigrams serve as the warp, and the fifty-six hexagrams to the left and right serve as the weft—this is what the *Commentary* means by \"Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operate within them.\" If one observes with *Pi* above and *Tai* below, the eight trigrams form ranks, and the fifty-six hexagrams intermingle above and below—this is what the *Commentary* means by \"*Qian* and *Kun* form ranks, and the *Changes* are established within them.\"\n\nThe twenty-eight hexagrams around the perimeter correspond to the twenty-eight constellations of heaven. From *Qian* to *Da Xu*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven eastern constellations of the Azure Dragon: *Jiao* begins at *Qian*, so *chen* aligns with *Kang* (Metal Dragon), and *mao* aligns with *Fang* (Sun Hare). From *Tai* to *Qian*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven northern constellations of the Dark Warrior: *chou* aligns with *Niu* (Metal Ox), and *zi* aligns with *Xu* (Sun Rat). From *Kun* to *Cui*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven western constellations of the White Tiger: *xu* aligns with *Lou* (Metal Dog), and *you* aligns with *Mao* (Sun Rooster). From *Pi* to *Lü*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven southern constellations of the Vermilion Bird: *wei* aligns with *Gui* (Metal Sheep), and *wu* aligns with *Xing* (Sun Horse).\n\nThus it is said: \"In heaven, images are formed; on earth, shapes are made.\" And the *Tuan* commentary on *Bi* states: \"Observe the patterns of heaven to examine the changes of the seasons; observe the patterns of humanity to transform and perfect the world.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\nAt the new moon, *Fu* arises, and the yang qi begins to flow.\nEntering and exiting without haste, set up the gnomon to detect its subtle strength.\nWhen the Yellow Bell establishes *zi*, the first signs flourish.\nScatter warmth and softness, and the millet and mugwort thrive as usual.\nApply the firing times to the furnace, open the path to proper illumination.\nThe radiance gradually advances, and the days grow longer.\nAt *chou*, the Great Pitch, balance is established, high and low.\nRaising it forms *Tai*, where firm and yielding prosper together.\nYin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives.\nThe spokes converge at *yin*, moving in accord with the seasons.\nGradually passing through *Da Zhuang*, they flank the gate of *mao*.\nThe elm pods fall, returning to their root.\nPunishment and virtue alternate, and day and night begin to divide.\n*Guai* retreats with the yin, while the yang ascends forward.\nWash the wings, shake off the dust of the roost.\n*Qian* is vigorous and bright, widely covering the four neighbors.\nThe yang ends at *si*, ending yet interacting.\n*Gou* begins the lineage, treading frost first.\nThe cold spring at the well’s bottom—*wu* is the *Ruibin*.\nThe guest submits to the yin, and the yin becomes the host.\n*Dun* departs from its position, gathering its essence.\nCherishing virtue and awaiting the time, it dwells in obscurity.\n*Pi* is closed and impassable, and what sprouts does not grow.\nThe yin extends, the yang withdraws, and the yang’s name is lost.\nObserve its radiant light, examine the conditions of mid-autumn.\nNurture the tender and young, and the old and withered flourish again.\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, together covering and growing.\n*Bo* decays the limbs, dissolving its form.\nThe transforming qi is exhausted, and the utmost spirit is lost.\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it returns—back to the origin of *Kun*.\nEver following the patterns of earth, it receives heaven and spreads forth.\nDark and distant, faint and subtle, separated yet connected.\nResponding to measure and nurturing life, they are the source of yin and yang.\nVast and indistinct, none know their beginning.\nThose who first lose the track later become the lords.\n\nThere is no level without slope—this is the natural Way.\nTransformation and flourishing alternate; waxing and waning follow one another.\nThe end of *Kun* is the beginning of *Fu*, like tracing an unbroken ring.\nThe emperors and kings who inherit and serve endure through a thousand autumns.\n\nShaozi’s *Chant of the Great Changes* says:\nHeaven and earth take their positions—*Pi* and *Tai* reverse their kinds;\nMountains and marshes exchange qi—*Sun* and *Xian* reveal their meanings;\nThunder and wind press upon each other—*Heng* and *Yi* arise in intent;\nWater and fire contend—*Jiji* and *Weiji* are completed.\nThe four images intersect, forming sixteen matters;\nThe eight trigrams overlap, producing sixty-four.\nZhu Xi said this explains the two intersecting legs of the square diagram:\nThe southeast corner is *Qian*, directly opposite the northwest corner *Kun*—formerly, the southeast was *Kun*, sealing the northwest as *Qian*.\nThis is \"heaven and earth take their positions.\"\nThe southwest corner is *Pi*, opposite the northeast corner *Tai*—*Pi* and *Tai* reverse their kinds.\nHow wondrously precise it is!\n\nXin’an Cheng Zhifang said:\nShaozi’s \"precelestial learning\" is the method of the heart—all diagrams arise from the center, for the myriad transformations and affairs are born of the heart.\n\"All\" refers to both the square and round diagrams.\n\"Heaven and earth take their positions\"—the round diagram begins from the center.\n\"Thunder moves, wind scatters\"—the square diagram begins from the center.\nThe round is dynamic, with fixed positions as its root;\nThe square is still, with movement and dispersion as its function.\nMoving yet without movement, still yet without stillness—this is truly the heart-method of the precelestial.\nThe *Commentary* says:\n\"The eight trigrams form an array, and their images are therein.\nThereupon they are doubled, and their lines are therein.\nHard and soft push one another, and change is therein.\nThey are struck with words to name them, and movement is therein.\nFortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—these arise from movement.\"\n*(Right: First section of the \"Appended Judgments Below\")*\n\nThis elucidates the meaning of the sixty-four precelestial trigrams in the square diagram.\n\"The eight trigrams form an array\"—*Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Kun* align in rows.\nThis is counted from top to bottom, from left to right.\nIf counted from the center outward, then *Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, *Qian*, *Xun*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Kun* also form an array.\nWhether horizontal, slanted, curved, straight, left, right, front, or back—all are thus, and the images of heaven, earth, water, fire, thunder, wind, mountain, and marsh are therein.\n\"Thereupon they are doubled\"—each of the eight trigrams is overlaid with another eight, dividing yin and yang, alternating soft and hard, and the six lines—initial, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top—are therein.\n\"Hard and soft push one another\"—hardness arises from the initial nine of *Fu*, advancing from one to two, three, four, five, and upward to the six of *Qian*;\nSoftness arises from the initial six of *Gou*, advancing from one to two, three, four, five, and downward to the six of *Kun*—thus the changes of trigrams and lines are therein.\nThe sages, following the changes of trigrams and lines, appended words of fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—thus all movement under heaven is therein.\n\n*Inner Chapters on the Images and Symbols of the Changes*, Volume Middle, concludes.\n\n#1 \"Therein\" originally written as \"left,\" emended according to the *Siku* edition.\n#2 \"Its sequence\" in one *Siku* edition reads \"its narration.\"\n\n*Inner Chapters on the Images and Symbols of the Changes*, Volume Lower\nComposed by Zhang Li Zhongchun, a later scholar of Qingjiang\n\nDiagram Nine: The Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Transformations and Transmutations\n\nThe *Commentary* states: Hardness and softness establish the root. Transformation and adaptation follow the times. Fortune and misfortune arise from constancy prevailing. The Dao of heaven and earth is constancy in observation. The Dao of sun and moon is constancy in illumination. All movement under heaven is constancy in unity.\n\nThe above *Commentary* elucidates the meaning of the sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations in the Posterior Heaven arrangement. Hardness and softness are the fundamental substance of transformation. Transformation and adaptation are the timely application of hardness and softness. Examining this through the diagram: *Qian* is hard and *Kun* is soft, positioned above and below—these are the unchanging, fixed forms. Thus it is said: Hardness and softness establish the root. When the initial line of *Kun* softens and advances toward hardness, it becomes *Fu*, *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, and *Guai*, reaching its extreme as *Qian*, progressing from winter to summer. When the initial line of *Qian* hardens and shifts toward softness, it becomes *Gou*, *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, and *Bo*, retreating to its extreme as *Kun*, moving from summer to winter. Thus it is said: Transformation and adaptation follow the times.\n\nTherefore, when *Qian* and *Kun* transform through their initial lines, the hexagrams of one yin and one yang each number six, all derived from *Fu* and *Gou*. When they transform through their second lines, the hexagrams of two yin and two yang each number fifteen, all derived from *Lin* and *Dun*. When they transform through their third lines, the hexagrams of three yin and three yang each number twenty, all derived from *Tai* and *Pi*. When they transform through their fourth lines, the hexagrams of four yin and four yang each number fifteen, all derived from *Dazhuang* and *Guan*. When they transform through their fifth lines, the hexagrams of five yin and five yang each number six, all derived from *Guai* and *Bo*. Vertically and horizontally, forward and backward, they mutually derive from one another without exception. If one understands their transformations, there is no rigidity, and nothing is impassable. As the *Commentary* says: \"Movement does not abide; it circulates through the six positions. Above and below have no constancy; hardness and softness interchange. One cannot rely on fixed principles; only adaptation to change suffices.\"\n\nYet yang governs advance, ascending leftward from *Fu*; yin governs retreat, descending rightward from *Gou*. In *Tai* and *Pi*, yin and yang are evenly divided: from *yin* to *shen*, all is day, and *Qian* truly envelops it; from *you* to *chou*, all is night, and *Kun* truly sustains it. Thus the *Great Appendix* states: \"Transformation and change are the images of advance and retreat; hardness and softness are the images of day and night.\" Whether hard or soft, there are losses and gains, and the principles of fortune and misfortune constantly prevail over one another.\n\n*Qian* above and *Kun* below, their forms fixed and unchanging—this is the Dao of heaven and earth, constancy in observation. *Li* in the south and *Kan* in the north: the sun shines by day, the moon appears by night—this is the Dao of sun and moon, constancy in illumination. All movement under heaven is endlessly changing; following principle brings fortune, opposing it brings misfortune. What is correct and constant is unified by constancy—this is but one principle.\n\nFollowing Master Zhu’s interpretation of the *Cantong Qi*, which takes *Qian* and *Kun* as the cauldron and vessel, *Kan* and *Li* as the medicinal ingredients, and the remaining sixty hexagrams as the firing times, this diagram may be understood as aligning the human body with the yin and yang of heaven and earth. *Qian* is the head and resides above; *Kun* is the abdomen and resides below. *Li* is the heart, *Kan* the kidneys. The heart is fire, the kidneys water—thus *Li* is above and *Kan* below. Yang arises from *Fu*, ascending leftward along the human *du mai*, the yang vessel, which rises from the coccyx along the spine to the head. Yin arises from *Gou*, descending rightward along the *ren mai*, the yin vessel, which descends from the throat along the chest and abdomen to the lower body.\n\nThe upper twenty hexagrams model heaven. Heaven is the light and pure aspect of yang, hence they are all hexagrams of four or five yang lines. The lower twenty hexagrams model earth. Earth is the heavy and turbid aspect of yin, hence they are all hexagrams of four or five yin lines. The middle twenty hexagrams resemble humans. Humans embody the virtue of heaven and earth and the interaction of yin and yang, hence they are all hexagrams of three yin and three yang lines—just as the human meridians and limbs each have three yin and three yang. Moreover, the upper part of the human body models heaven, the middle part models humans, and the lower part models earth—this is also its meaning. From this, it is clear that the meaning of the *Cantong Qi* is not unfounded.\n\nAs for *Heng* residing in the center, it corresponds to the *Book of Documents*’ \"if one has a constant nature,\" the *Commentary*’s \"constancy in unifying virtue,\" and *Mencius*’ \"constant heart and constancy in it.\" The *Tuan* states: \"The sun and moon attain heaven and thus can shine long; the four seasons transform and thus can endure in completion. The sage endures in the Dao, and all under heaven is transformed and completed. Observing what is constant, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things can be seen.\"\n\n**Diagram Ten: The Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Application**\n\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: \"The Supreme Deity emerges from *Zhen*, aligns in *Xun*, appears in *Li*, labors in *Kun*, delights in speech through *Dui*, contends in *Qian*, toils in *Kan*, and completes speech in *Gen*.\"\n\n**Diagram of the Images of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Application in the Posterior Heaven Arrangement**\n\nThe determination of hexagram positions has long been doubted by Master Zhu, who deemed it proper to leave it unresolved rather than force an explanation. Later scholars, however, have attempted to justify it through the interchange of lines and the sequence of the five phases, merely imposing their interpretations on the existing positions without any solid basis.\n\nNow, examining the transformations of the *Hetu*’s images and numbers, and further deriving the Prior Heaven hexagram positions along with those found in common divination texts, another diagram is presented, accompanied by this explanation: *Qian* arises in the northwest, reflecting the principle that \"heaven inclines toward the northwest.\"\n\n*(Text missing: approximately thirty characters.)*\n\nSince *Qian* is positioned in the northwest, *Kun* should occupy the southeast. However, as \"earth is incomplete in the southeast,\" *Xun*, the eldest daughter, takes its place—*Xun* being the inversion of *Dui* in the Prior Heaven arrangement.\n\nThus, *Kun* retreats to the southwest, its three lines all transforming into *Qian*; *Qian*’s three lines all transforming into *Kun*, mutually opposed and inverted, so that the positions of *Qian* and *Kun* are vertically aligned. *Li* fire flames upward and resides in the south, *Kan* water moistens downward and resides in the north. *Kan*’s three lines all transform into *Li*, *Li*’s three lines all transform into *Kan*, likewise mutually opposed and inverted, so that the positions of *Kan* and *Li* are vertically aligned. *Gen* inverts the Prior Heaven *Zhen* and occupies the northeast, *Xun* inverts the Prior Heaven *Dui* and occupies the southeast. *Gen*’s three lines all transform into *Dui*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Xun*; *Xun*’s three lines all transform into *Zhen*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Gen*, likewise mutually opposed and inverted, so that the positions of *Gen* and *Xun* are vertically aligned.\n\nLightning excites thunder, thus *Zhen* occupies the due east, the Prior Heaven position of *Li*; *Li* fire flames upward, thus its top line transforms into *Zhen*. Its three lines all transform into *Xun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Dui*. Water pools into marsh, thus *Dui* occupies the due west, the Prior Heaven position of *Kan*; *Kan* water moistens downward, thus its bottom line transforms into *Dui*. Its three lines all transform into *Gen*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Zhen*, so that *Zhen* and *Dui* are horizontally opposed, their positions aligned laterally.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Zhen* and *Dui* are lateral, while the six hexagrams are vertical—such is the application of the *Yi*.\" How profound these words! Precisely because of this, the palace hexagrams transmitted in contemporary divination also oppose one another: *Qian* and *Kun* are opposed, *Kan* and *Li* are opposed, *Zhen* and *Dui* are opposed, *Gen* and *Xun* are opposed. The *Gou* of the *Qian* palace derives from *Kun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Guai*; *Qian*’s *Dun* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Dazhuang*; *Qian*’s *Pi* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Tai*; *Qian*’s *Guan* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Lin*; *Qian*’s *Bo* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Fu*. The *Jie* of the *Kan* palace derives from *Li*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Huan*; *Kan*’s *Zhun* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Meng*; *Kan*’s *Jiji* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Weiji*; *Kan*’s *Ge* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Ding*; *Kan*’s *Feng* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Lü*. The *Bi* of the *Gen* palace derives from *Xun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Shihe*; *Gen*’s *Daxu* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Wuwang*; *Gen*’s *Sun* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Yi*; *Gen*’s *Kui* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Jiaren*; *Gen*’s *Lü* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Xiaoxu*. The *Yu* of the *Zhen* palace derives from *Dui*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Qian*; *Zhen*’s *Xie* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Jian*; *Zhen*’s *Heng* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Xian*; *Zhen*’s *Sheng* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Cui*; *Zhen*’s *Jing* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Kun*.\n\nThe two hexagrams of *Youhun* and *Guihun* are said to lie outside the regular transformations of the eight palaces. When the fifth line of the original palace hexagram transforms, yielding an outer-body hexagram, and the inner three lines all transform, it becomes *Youhun*. It is called *You* (\"wandering\") because it moves from inner to outer. When the fifth line transforms while the inner three lines remain unchanged, it becomes *Guihun*. It is called *Gui* (\"returning\") because it moves from outer back to inner. Revolving left and right, ascending and descending, the ritual and law of the king are fully encompassed herein.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Yarrow Stalks* states: \"The number of the great expansion is fifty; its use is forty-nine.\" Master Zhu said: \"The number of the great expansion is derived from the central five of the *Hetu* multiplied by the ten of earth. Multiplying five by ten or ten by five both yield fifty. Yet when used for divination, only forty-nine are employed—all arises from the natural principle and configuration, not something human intellect or effort can alter.\"\n\nThe forty-nine yarrow stalks on the right are bound into a single bundle, modeling the image of the undivided Great Ultimate. The reason for this number lies in the sum of the lines generating the eight hexagrams. For the yang instrument: one line for the instrument, two for the image, four for the hexagram—seven in total. For the yin instrument: one line for the instrument, two for the image, four for the hexagram—seven in total. Multiplying by seven yields forty-nine.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"The virtue of the yarrow stalks is round and spirit-like.\" Roundness arises from their odd number; when seven are gathered and clustered, natural roundness emerges. \"The virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing.\" Squareness arises from their even number; when eight directions are juxtaposed and layered, natural squareness emerges. \"Spirit\" denotes wondrous, unfathomable function; \"knowing\" denotes transformation without constraint. The yarrow stalks are yang, the hexagrams yin; the yarrow stalks move, the hexagrams are still—such is the ultimate embodiment and application of the *Great Yi*.\n\nThe right hand separates one. The *Commentary* states: \"Divide into two to model the Two; suspend one to model the Three.\" The Two are heaven and earth; the Three is humanity. \"Suspend\" means to set aside, as the *Yunhui* says: \"to place without use.\" The old explanation of suspending between the little finger and the next finger is untenable, for it would require a second \"binding\" before suspension, and it mistakenly assumes that the second transformation must involve suspension. A single character’s misinterpretation leads to endless confusion.\n\nThe forty-nine yarrow stalks on the right are divided into two to model the Two Modes, with one stalk suspended in the center to model humanity. The forty-eight stalks on the left and right represent the sum of the hexagram lines. The twenty-four primary lines of the eight hexagrams, when doubled, become forty-eight; moreover, each hexagram undergoes eight transformations, and its lines likewise number forty-eight. In the counting method, first take the left-hand stalks in the left hand, then with the right hand suspend one stalk from the right half in the center without further moving it, modeling humanity’s place between heaven and earth. Whether yin or yang, cold or heat, day or night, all transformations are left to heaven, with no human intervention. Though the one stalk does not intervene, it is always used alongside the forty-eight.\n\nThis models the Three Powers. Next, with the right hand, count the stalks in the left hand in groups of four and set aside the remainder—whether one, two, three, or four—between the little finger and the next finger, called the *le* (binding), symbolizing the intercalary month added every three years. Then, with the right hand, take the stalks from the right half: if one remains, take three; if three remain, take one; if two remain, take six; if four remain, take four, and bind them between the next finger and the middle finger, called the *second le*, symbolizing the two intercalary months in five years. Only then is the suspended stalk addressed: the two remainders from the bindings are combined and placed with the suspended stalk, following the method of \"suspending one.\" As the *Yunhui* states, \"combine and place them together.\" The number of bound remainders is either four or eight—never five or nine. Four is considered odd, being a single four. Eight is considered even, being two fours. Then, the stalks that have been counted are recombined: either forty-four or forty remain. The division, counting, binding, and suspending proceed as before for the second transformation. The remaining stalks after counting are then recombined: either forty, thirty-six, or thirty-two, and the division, counting, binding, and suspending proceed again for the third transformation. After three transformations, the suspended stalks are examined: three odd remainders indicate *old yang*; three even remainders indicate *old yin*. Two even and one odd, with the odd as primary, indicate *young yang*; two odd and one even, with the even as primary, indicate *young yin*. Each set of three transformations forms one line, and eighteen transformations form one hexagram. One hexagram can transform into sixty-four hexagrams, encompassing the four thousand ninety-six possible hexagrams. As the *Commentary* states: \"Count in fours to model the four seasons; bind the remainders to model intercalary months. Five years contain two intercalary months, hence the second binding before suspending.\"\n\nIn this diagram, when four stalks are counted from the left and one remains, three remain on the right; when three remain on the left, one remains on the right—these are the yang numbers of the bound remainders for the Two Modes. When two remain on the left, six are taken on the right; when four remain on the left, four also remain on the right—these are the yin numbers of the bound remainders for the Two Modes. Master Zhu said: \"The symbol of the odd is round: a circle has a diameter of one and a circumference of three, and yang employs its fullness. Old yang has three odd remainders, three threes making nine, and the counted stalks number thirty-six. The symbol of the even is square: a square has a diameter of one and a circumference of four, and yin employs its half. Old yin has three even remainders, three twos making six, and the counted stalks number twenty-four. Young yang has one odd and two even remainders: one odd is three, two evens are two each, totaling seven (one three and two twos), and the counted stalks number twenty-eight. Young yin has one even and two odd remainders: one even is two, two odds are three each, totaling eight (one two and two threes), and the counted stalks number thirty-two. Such is the natural wonder of the milfoil numbers and hexagram lines.\"\n\nOn the right: each set of three transformations forms one line. If all three transformations yield odd remainders, it resembles *Qian*, and the line is drawn as ⚊, signifying yang transforming into yin. If all three transformations yield even remainders, it resembles *Kun*, and the line is drawn as ⚋, signifying yin transforming into yang. If two odd and one even remainders are obtained, with the even as primary, the position of the even—whether initial, second, or third—resembles *Xun*, *Li*, or *Dui*, and the line is drawn as — without change. If two even and one odd remainders are obtained, with the odd as primary, the position of the odd—whether initial, second, or third—resembles *Zhen*, *Kan*, or *Gen*, and the line is drawn as — without change. These eight forms correspond to the eight trigrams.\n\nThe form ⚊ comprises twenty-four instances. The form ⚋ likewise comprises twenty-four instances. The form — comprises eight instances. The form — comprises eight instances. In total, there are sixty-four instances, as explained in the subsequent diagram.\n\nOn the right: two even and one odd remainders, with the odd as primary, represent the stalks of *young yang* for *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Zhen*, totaling twenty-four. For *Gen*, the odd remainder is obtained in the third transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Kan*, the odd remainder is obtained in the second transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Zhen*, the odd remainder is obtained in the initial transformation, yielding eight stalks. The bound remainders total five, and five fives make seven when counted, with seven fours representing yang in its correct and unchanging state.\n\nOn the right: two odd and one even remainders, with the even as primary, represent the stalks of *young yin* for *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*, totaling twenty-four. For *Xun*, the even remainder is obtained in the initial transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Li*, the even remainder is obtained in the second transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Dui*, the even remainder is obtained in the third transformation, yielding eight stalks. The bound remainders total sixteen, and the counted stalks total thirty-two; divided by four, the bound remainders total four, and four fours make eight when counted, representing yin in its correct and unchanging state.\n\nOn the right: three odd remainders indicate *old yang*, representing the stalks of *Qian*, totaling eight. The bound remainders total twelve, and the counted stalks total thirty-six; divided by four, the bound remainders total three, and three fours make nine when counted—nine nines of four nines represent yang at its extreme, transforming into yin. The *Book of Changes* uses transformation for divination, and all changing yang lines are collectively called \"nine.\"\n\nOn the right: three even remainders indicate *old yin*, representing the stalks of *Kun*, totaling eight. The bound remainders total twenty-four, and the counted stalks likewise total twenty-four; divided by four, the bound remainders total six, and six fours make six when counted—six sixes of four sixes represent yin at its extreme, transforming into yang. The *Book of Changes* uses transformation for divination, and all changing yin lines are collectively called \"six.\"\n\nOn the right: the eight forms of the trigrams each comprise eight instances, together forming the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\nThe method of stalk division follows Master Cheng. Master Zhang Zi said: \"In the second and third changes, one does not suspend a stalk.\" This is because in the first change, one stalk is suspended to symbolize the human, set aside and unused; the subsequent two changes then proceed without further suspension, which is correct. The left is divided but not the right, following the methods of Tang scholars Zhang Yuan and Zhuang Cho. As heaven moves and earth is still, yang transforms and yin unites, and earth follows heaven in its course—this accords with principle. When the left leaves a remainder of one and the right complements it with three, or leaves three and complements it with one, this completes the oddness of yang. When the left leaves a remainder of two and the right complements it with six, or leaves four and complements it with four, this completes the evenness of yin. Yin and yang, greater and lesser, are balanced and upright. If, as in recent times, all three changes involve suspension and both left and right are divided, then old yang numbers twelve, lesser yin twenty-eight, lesser yang twenty, and old yin four—uneven and disproportionate. If the first change involves suspension while the latter two do not, yet both left and right are still divided, then greater yang numbers twenty-seven, lesser yin twenty-seven, lesser yang nine, and greater yin one. Though all sum to sixty-four, the body of greater yin is exceedingly rare. There may be those who divide stalks all year without ever encountering the transformation of pure *Kun* into *Qian*. Those who understand transformation should diligently study these subtleties.\n\nExamining the changes for divination: the stalks of *Qian* number two hundred sixteen, and those of *Kun* one hundred forty-four, together totaling three hundred sixty, corresponding to the days of a year. The stalks of the two *Books* number eleven thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the number of all things. Thus, four operations complete the *Changes*, eighteen changes complete a hexagram, and eight trigrams form a lesser completion. Extending and expanding this, following categories to their fullest, the abilities of all under heaven are exhausted.\n\nThe stalks of *Qian* are calculated by multiplying the number of old yang, thirty-six, by the six lines of a hexagram, yielding two hundred sixteen. The stalks of *Kun* are calculated by multiplying the number of old yin, twenty-four, by the six lines of a hexagram, yielding one hundred forty-four. Together, they total three hundred sixty. \"Corresponding to the days of a year\" refers to the Zhou calendar, where eleven months form a year. Counting by new moons, there are three hundred fifty-four days; counting by solar terms, there are three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days. Taking the median between the excess of solar terms and the deficiency of new moons, it is said to be three hundred sixty. However, the stalks of lesser yang number twenty-eight; multiplied by the six lines of *Qian*, they total one hundred sixty-eight. The stalks of lesser yin number thirty-two; multiplied by the six lines of *Kun*, they total one hundred ninety-two. Together, they also total three hundred sixty. The *Great Commentary* does not mention this because the *Changes* employs nine and six, not seven and eight.\n\nThe two *Books* refer to the sixty-four hexagrams of the upper and lower canons. There are one hundred ninety-two yang lines; multiplying by old yang’s thirty-six yields six thousand nine hundred twelve. There are one hundred ninety-two yin lines; multiplying by old yin’s twenty-four yields four thousand six hundred eight. Together, they total eleven thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the number of all things. However, multiplying lesser yang’s twenty-eight by one hundred ninety-two yang lines yields five thousand three hundred seventy-six. Multiplying lesser yin’s thirty-two by one hundred ninety-two yin lines yields six thousand one hundred forty-four. Together, they also total eleven thousand five hundred twenty. Thus, the numbers of lesser yin and lesser yang are concealed within those of old yin and old yang. Seven and nine are both yang and odd, while six and eight are both yin and even—this is the meaning of *Qian*’s nine and *Kun*’s six.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram employs nine: \"Seeing a hidden dragon without a head is auspicious.\" The *Kun* hexagram employs six: \"Beneficial for eternal steadfastness.\" The above clarifies the general rules for divination using the nine and six changes of the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"When none of the six lines of a hexagram change, one divines using the hexagram’s image and judgment, taking the inner trigram as the primary (*zhen*) and the outer trigram as the regret (*hui*).\" According to the *Zuozhuan*: Kong Chengzi divined the establishment of Wei’s Prince Yuan and encountered *Tun* (☳ below ☵ above), saying, \"Beneficial to establish a lord.\" The Duke of Qin divined his attack on Jin and encountered *Gu* (☴ below ☶ above), saying, \"*Gu*’s primary is wind; its regret is mountain.\" These are examples of divining with the hexagram’s image and judgment when none of its six lines change.\n\nWhen one line changes, one divines using the changing line’s judgment from the original hexagram. Bi Wan of Jin encountered *Tun* (☳ below ☵ above) transforming into *Bi* (☷ below ☵ above)—the first line, nine. Cai Mo encountered *Qian* (☰ below ☰ above) transforming into *Tongren* (☲ below ☰ above)—the second line, nine. Duke Wen of Jin encountered *Dayou* (☰ below ☲ above) transforming into *Kui* (☱ below ☲ above)—the third line, nine. Chen Jingzhong encountered *Guan* (☷ below ☴ above) transforming into *Pi* (☷ below ☰ above)—the fourth line, six. Nan Kuo encountered *Kun* (☷ above ☷ below) transforming into *Bi* (☷ below ☵ above)—the fifth line, six. Duke Xian of Jin encountered *Guimei* (☱ below ☳ above) transforming into *Kui* (☱ below ☲ above)—the top line, six. These are examples of divining with the changing line’s judgment when one line changes.\n\nWhen two lines change, one divines using the judgments of the two changing lines from the original hexagram, still taking the upper line as primary—though the *Commentary* provides no examples. When three lines change, one divines using the image and judgment of both the original and resultant hexagrams, taking the original hexagram as primary (*zhen*) and the resultant hexagram as regret (*hui*). Prince Chong’er divined his attainment of the state and encountered *Zhen* (☳ below ☵ above) as primary and *Yu* (☷ below ☳ above) as regret—all lines were eight, for the first and fifth lines were nine, and the fourth line was six, totaling three changing lines.\n\nWhen two, three, or the top line are all eight in both hexagrams, as in the case divined by Minister Ji of Sikong, who declared: \"All are favorable for establishing feudal lords.\" This is the example of three changing lines. Moreover, in the first ten hexagrams, the original hexagram governs the *zhen* (primary), while in the latter ten, the resultant hexagram governs the *hui* (regret), as shown in the *Sixty-Four Hexagrams Transformation Diagram* in the *Qimeng*. When four lines change, one divines using the two unchanging lines of the resultant hexagram, still taking the lower line as primary—though the *Commentary* provides no examples. When five lines change, one divines using the unchanging line of the resultant hexagram.\n\nMu Jiang, on her way to the eastern palace, encountered *Gen* (☶ below ☶ above) with eight. The scribe said: \"This is called *Gen* transforming into *Sui* (☳ below ☱ above).\" For the first, fourth, and fifth lines were six, and the third and top lines were nine—all five lines changed. Only the second line was eight, remaining unchanging. By rule, one should use the judgment of *Sui*’s second line—*\"Tied to a youth, losing a man\"*—for the divination, yet the scribe wrongly cited *Sui*’s image statement in response; this was incorrect.\n\nWhen all six lines change, only in the cases of *Qian* and *Kun* are the judgments of both hexagrams used; for other hexagrams, one uses the image statement of the resultant hexagram. Cai Mo said: \"*Qian* transforming into *Kun* is called *'Seeing a flock of dragons without a head—auspicious.'*\" This is its example. Thus, one hexagram may transform into sixty-four hexagrams, and the forty thousand ninety-six hexagrams are contained therein.\n\nDrawing it forth and extending it, touching upon categories and expanding them—all the capabilities under Heaven are therein exhausted.\n\n*End of Inner Chapters, Vol. Lower of* Explanations of the Images of the *Yi* *#1 Originally written as \"Later Requirement\" (后需), emended according to the *Siku* edition. #2 Originally missing \"one\" (余一), supplied according to the *Siku* edition. #3 Originally written as \"two\" (二), emended to \"three\" (三) according to the *Siku* edition. #4 Originally written as [ ], emended according to the *Siku* edition. #5 Originally written as \"glory\" (荣), emended to \"counting rods\" (策) according to the *Siku* edition.

Therefore, the interweaving of yin and yang, the union and separation of odd and even, all find their mutual resonance therein.\n\nIn the *Rites of Zhou*, the three *Yi* systems all consist of eight fundamental trigrams, with their distinctions comprising sixty-four hexagrams. Taking the eight as the warp and the sixty-four as the weft, the sequence of hexagram formation reveals the positions of the Primordial Heaven diagram. Thus, when Fuxi composed the *Yi*, the diagram already existed, transmitted through the Three Dynasties. Hence, Confucius’s explanations of the *ji* (extremes), *yi* (modes), *xiang* (images), and *gua* (trigrams), along with his doubling of them, as well as the methods of Jing Junming and Wei Boyang for incorporating the celestial stems into the hexagram qi, all follow the sequence of the circular diagram. The Primordial Heaven diagram has thus existed for a long time. Yet later scholars of the *Yi* no longer traced the original source of its composition, so although the diagram remained, it was not transmitted among scholars until Master Shao revived it.\n\nEarlier scholars claimed that Master Shao transmitted it to Li Mu, who received it from Chen Tuan (Huiyi). This transmission must not have been false. Some have also suggested that the Primordial Heaven diagram in the *Qiankun Birth of Learning* originated from the Cai family, and that Master Zhu adopted it. Yet since Zhu Hanshang already possessed this diagram, its origin from the Shao lineage is beyond doubt. Even if the sages were to return, they would not alter these words.\n\nHowever, the Dao of the *Yi* is vast and boundless. Scholars, following their own insights, may all attain understanding. Only when their insights arise naturally, without forced interpretation, can they establish a school of thought, even if their discoveries were not previously expounded by the ancients.\n\nMaster Zhang Zhongchun of Qingjiang, endowed with keen intelligence and profound learning, is well-versed in all the classics but is especially profound in the *Yi*. He once applied his diligent study to compose the *Explanation of the Images of the *Yi***. In it, the *ji*, *yi*, *xiang*, and *gua* are illustrated with the odd above and the even below, each generating yin and yang, firmness and softness, inner and outer, and mutual transformations. The origins of hexagram formation, the principles of the four seasons, the discourse on nature and destiny, the numbers of the diagrams and writings, and the changes and divination of the milfoil stalks are all comprehensively covered.\n\nIn the circular diagram of the sixty-four hexagrams, Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun are arranged in a rotating cycle, revealing the movements and stillness of heaven and earth, the qi nodes of a full year’s celestial circuit, and the monthly progression of the moon’s phases. In the square diagram, Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Gen, and Kun are arranged vertically from top to bottom and horizontally from left to right, allowing for the derivation of the hexagram qi of the twelve months and the images of the twenty-eight lunar lodges in the *Cantong Qi* and Master Shao’s *Taiyi Hymn*.\n\nThe diagrams proceed from the mutual generation of *Qian* and *Kun*, with yang ascending leftward in sequence and yin descending rightward in sequence, so that the order of the six yang and six yin hexagrams is clearly evident in their application. In the diagram of the eight palaces of the Manifested Heaven, each transforming into seven hexagrams, the images of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions are arranged in orderly opposition. All these are ingeniously and neatly structured, requiring no forced effort, with no room for addition or subtraction, nor any doubt or dispute. Such is the meaning of arising naturally without forced interpretation. This work should be appended to the diagrams of Master Shao and Master Zhu, establishing its own school. It also demonstrates that the images of the *Yi* are universally resonant, and only when scholars follow their own insights and attain genuine understanding can their work be transmitted to posterity without confusion.\n\nMaster Zhongchun’s learning is lofty and enlightened, and I have known him the longest. Upon the completion of the *Explanation of the Images*, he first honored me with its presentation. I particularly admire its seamless integration of images and its precise and meticulous structure. Thus, I have presumptuously inscribed this preface at the beginning and return it to him.\n\nRespectfully written by Huang Zhencheng of Ziyun Mountain in the seventh month of autumn, the dingyou year of the Zhizheng era.\n\n**The *Yi* states:** “The Yellow River brought forth the Diagram; the Luo River brought forth the Writing. The sages took them as their model.”\nThe diagrams and writings are the images of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. The *Yi* is the means by which the sages depicted the spirit of the yin and yang of heaven and earth. Thus, every movement and stillness takes form as the Supreme Ultimate. The ceaseless generation of odd and even, the mutual transformation of movement and stillness, the four images above and below, and their left-right interactions give rise to the hexagram drawings of the *Yi*.\n\nDrawing heaven,\nDrawing earth,\nDrawing water,\nDrawing fire,\nDrawing marsh,\nDrawing mountain,\nWind arising from marsh,\nThunder arising from mountain,\nTrigrams representing images,\nImages giving rise to names,\nNames revealing meanings,\nMeanings rectifying words,\nWords conveying the composition of the *Yi* book.",

      "translated_text": "To align with the principles of nature and destiny, to explore the origins of ritual and music, and to accomplish transformations and enact the workings of spirits and deities—all fundamentally derive from the images and numbers of the *Diagrams and Writings* alone.\n\nThe diagram of heaven (○) represents the One. The diagram of earth ( ) represents the Two. The central diagram ( ) embodies the Four Images and the Five Phases.\n\nThe yang numbers—one, three, five—are the \"three of heaven,\" where three is called *san*. The yin numbers—two, four—are the \"two of earth,\" where two is called *liang*. The \"three of heaven\" culminates in nine, the active expression of yang. The \"two of earth\" culminates in six, the active expression of yin.\n\nThe horizontal lines in the *Writings* form the structure of the three trigrams. The well-like arrangement in the *Writings* marks the positions of the nine trigrams. The intersecting vertical and horizontal lines (＃５) unite the fifteen trigrams: *Qian* nine and *Kun* six sum to fifteen; *Kan* seven and *Li* eight sum to fifteen; *Zhen* seven and *Xun* eight sum to fifteen; *Gen* seven and *Dui* eight sum to fifteen. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft to one another. Fifty-five is the pivotal number of the *Diagrams and Writings*. When five is doubled to ten, the left, right, front, and back form the four cardinal directions of the *River Diagram*. When five intersects with ten, the four cardinals and four corners compose the nine palaces of the *Luo Writing*. The leftward, circular motion follows the roundness of heaven, from which the armillary sphere and celestial reckoning arise. The rightward, linear arrangement follows the squareness of earth, from which the systems of enfeoffment and well-field governance emerge. Encompassing the square within the circle and confining the circle within the square, one thereby models the transformations of heaven and earth without excess, and nurtures the myriad things without omission.\n\nMan alone embodies the virtue of heaven and earth, the convergence of yin and yang, the meeting of spirits and deities, and the essence of the Five Phases. The upper half of the body corresponds to heaven, the lower half to earth. The head is round, the feet square; the abdomen is yin, the back yang. The eyes of *Li* shine outward, the ears of *Kan* hear within. The mouth and nose resemble mountains and marshes, while voice and breath mirror thunder and wind. Thus, the principles of the world are fulfilled and take their place within him.\n\nKnow then that the *Yi* is my heart, and my heart is the *Yi*. Expounding its diagrams, one arranges the six positions to complete the Three Powers. Ordering its sequences, one follows the six seasons to enact the Four Phases. Uniting its forms, one embodies the six constituents of the physical self. Tracing its channels, one perfects the six pulses to preserve spirit and qi. Outlining its classics, one establishes the six canons of governance and education. Harmonizing its tones, one balances the six pitches to regulate sound. Instituting its codes, one refines the six statutes to govern. Commanding its hosts, one pacifies the six armies to secure the state. Thus, by means of positions, one illuminates the Dao; by means of seasons, one cultivates virtue; by means of forms, one fathoms nature; by means of pulses, one consolidates destiny; by means of classics, one examines ritual; by means of tones, one rectifies music; by means of codes, one governs justly; by means of hosts, one administers punishment with care. Therein, the substance and function of the eight trigrams of the *Great Yi* are fully realized.\n\nThe eight diagrams above are appended to the outer chapter. As the eight trigrams intermingle, rub against, and stir one another, they are doubled, transformed, and extended, giving rise to the circular and square diagrams of the sixty-four hexagrams in their varied applications. The circular diagrams emulate heaven, the square diagrams model earth, the transformations follow the Dao, and the applications harmonize with righteousness. Then, through milfoil stalks, one synthesizes their numbers; through divination, one clarifies their auguries. The processes of division, suspension, counting, and return—along with the interplay of lines and the permutations of branches—are all rendered as diagrams to manifest their images and as explanations to expound their purport.\n\nThough these words do not adhere to the interpretations of earlier Confucian scholars, they may yet approximate the grand intent of the sages in composing the *Yi*. Corrections and verifications are earnestly sought from those of like mind.\n\nIn the twenty-fourth year of the Zhizheng era, the year of *jiachen* in the cycle, on the third day of the third month (the *shangsi* festival), Zhang Li of Qingjiang, a later student, inscribed this at the *Gen* abode of Sanshan.\n\n*Inner Chapters on the Diagrams of the Yi Images, Volume One*\n*Inner Chapters on the Diagrams of the Yi Images, Volume One*\nComposed by Zhang Li, styled Zhongchun, a later student of Qingjiang\n\nMaster Chen of Xiyi’s *Preface to the Dragon Diagram* states:\nNow, the dragon-horse first bore the Diagram, emerging in the age of Fuxi, prior to high antiquity. Even the extant, already-combined positions are met with skepticism—how much more so the numbers before their combination? Yet how is this known? The answer lies in Confucius’s threefold exposition of the nine hexagrams, through which their purport is discerned. Moreover, the celestial images hang as if strung like pearls; the slightest deviation would disrupt their order. Thus, from one to ten thousand, all are arrayed as if threaded upon a single strand.\n\nIf the *Dragon Diagram* were already combined, the sages would not have perceived its images. Therefore, Heaven’s intent first revealed its images in an uncombined state, so that the sages might observe the images and comprehend their use. The *Dragon Diagram* was scattered by Heaven to display its forms, combined by Fuxi to employ them, and silently shaped by Confucius. Initially, the *Dragon Diagram* was uncombined: the fifty-five numbers, with twenty-five above as the numbers of heaven, the central passage of three, five, and nine, and the outer enclosure of fifteen, exhausting the heavenly three, five, and nine, along with the positions of ten and five. Later, the positions of one and six were absent, while the functions of two, ten, and four were manifest—this is what is meant by \"Heaven hanging its images.\" The thirty below are the numbers of earth, also divided into five positions, all elucidating the function of five. Divided into six, they form the image of earth. Further divided into four images, earth’s six does not pair. Above, one does not pair, forming two, ten, and four; below, six is unused, also forming two, ten, and four. After combination: Heaven’s one resides above as the origin of the Dao; Earth’s six resides below as the root of vessels. Three revolves through Earth’s two and four to fulfill their function.\n\n**Annotation:** *San* (three) combines the heavenly numbers one and three to make nine, which is the \"nine used by *Qian*’s primordial yang.\"",

      "translated_text": "Two combines the earthly numbers two and four to make six—this is what is meant by \"*Kun*’s primordial six in use.\"\n\nWhen three resides in yang, it avoids solitary yin; when in yin, it avoids orphaned yang.\n**Annotation:** The eight trigrams are formed by three positions. Above, one, three, and five constitute three positions, while two and four, lacking central equilibrium, cannot form trigrams and become solitary yin. Below, six, eight, and ten constitute three positions, while seven and nine, lacking central equilibrium, cannot form trigrams and become orphaned yang. Three avoids both, as if in retreat.\n\nHow vast and wondrous are the transformations of the *Dragon Diagram*, branching into myriad paths! Here, I briefly outline its general principles.\n\nConfucius silently arranged three presentations of the nine trigrams:\n*The Treading* (*Lü*) is the foundation of virtue.\nThe sequence of trigrams follows ten, clarifying the use of ten and instructing people in distinguishing above and below.\n*The Humility* (*Qian*) is the handle of virtue.\nNext follows fifteen, clarifying the use of fifteen and instructing people in diminishing the many to augment the few.\n*The Return* (*Fu*) is the root of virtue.\nNext follows twenty-four trigrams, marking the beginning of qi’s transformation.\n*The Constancy* (*Heng*) is the firmness of virtue.\nThe lower classic’s sequence of two trigrams marks the beginning of form’s transformation.\n*The Decrease* (*Sun*) is the cultivation of virtue.\n*The Increase* (*Yi*) is the abundance of virtue.\nThese two trigrams instruct people in the origins of prosperity and decline.\n*The Distress* (*Kun*) is the discernment of virtue.\n*The Well* (*Jing*) is the domain of virtue.\nThese two trigrams instruct people in the principle of transition and communication.\n*The Gentle* (*Xun*) is the regulation of virtue.\n*Xun* enacts authority. Authority is the great function of the sage—adapting to circumstances, responding to the times, and embracing change.\n\n**Diagram One: The Numbers of the *Dragon Diagram* Before Heaven and Earth Combine**\nThe upper position represents the heavenly numbers. The heavenly numbers center on five, divided into five positions: five times five makes twenty-five. Summing one, three, five, and seven also yields twenty-five. The five positions vertically and horizontally reveal three; vertically and horizontally, they reveal five. The three positions vertically and horizontally reveal nine; vertically and horizontally, they reveal fifteen. The *Sequence* speaks of three, five, and nine running through the center, enveloped by fifteen—this is the meaning.\n\nThe lower position represents the earthly numbers. The earthly numbers center on six, also divided into five positions: five times six makes thirty. Summing two, four, six, eight, and ten also yields thirty. The *Sequence* speaks of \"dividing ten to make six, forming the image of earth\"—this is the meaning.\n\n**Diagram Two: The Positions of the *Dragon Diagram* After Heaven and Earth Combine**\nThe upper position represents images. Combining one, three, and five forms \"three for heaven\"; pairing four forms \"two for earth.\" Their sum is fifteen—the generative numbers of the five phases. This corresponds to the upper five positions of the previous image: subtracting four from the upper five yields one; subtracting three from the lower five yields two; subtracting two from the right five yields three; subtracting one from the left five yields four; only the central five remains unchanged. The *Sequence* speaks of \"Heaven’s one residing above as the origin of the Dao\"—this is the meaning.\n\nAccording to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendars*: \"Combining the two beginnings defines hardness and softness.\" One is the beginning of yang; two is the beginning of yin. Here, in this diagram, the upper \"heaven\" (一) is the image of one; the lower \"earth\" (六) is the image of two; the central \"heaven\" (五) represents the four images and five phases. The upper left (一○) is *great yang*, the image of fire; the upper right (一。) is *lesser yin*, the image of metal; the lower left (一。) is *lesser yang*, the image of wood; the lower right (一○) is *great yin*, the image of water. Earth’s *qi* resides centrally as the harmonizing force, circulating the four directions, propagating the beginning and extending life—it is both yin and yang. The three on the right represent the three powers, the basis of trigram lines; the four on the left represent the four seasons, the basis of yarrow-stalk divination. Thus, the upper images of one, two, three, and four are the essence of yarrow numbers and hexagram lines.\n\nThe lower position represents forms: nine, eight, seven, and six are the flourishing numbers of metal, wood, fire, and water; the central ten is the completed number of earth. This corresponds to the lower five positions of the previous image, where the central six is divided: placing one atop six forms seven; placing two to the left of six forms eight; placing three to the right of six forms nine; only the lower six remains unpaired as six. The *Sequence* speaks of \"dividing six to form the four images, with earth’s six unpaired\"—this is the meaning.\n\nNote: Seven is the roundness of yarrow stalks—seven times seven makes forty-nine. Eight is the squareness of trigrams—eight times eight makes sixty-four. Nine is the function of yang—yang lines number one hundred ninety-two. Six is the function of yin—yin lines also number one hundred ninety-two. Ten is the number of the *Great Expansion*—multiplying five by ten or ten by five both yield fifty. Thus, the lower forms of six, seven, eight, and nine are the functions of yarrow numbers and hexagram lines.\n\nThe upper is the essence, the lower the function; the upper is the image, the lower the form. Images move, forms are still; essence is established, function is enacted—and thus the workings of creation are inexhaustible.\n\nObserve: one, two, three, and four are the images of heaven, transforming above; six, seven, eight, and nine are the forms of earth, taking shape below. When above and below are layered, they form the five phases—this is the arrangement of left and right, front and back, generation and completion. When above and below intersect, they form the eight trigrams—this is the arrangement of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, the nine palaces. Comparing the previous and subsequent diagrams, it should resemble the *Taiyi Dunjia*’s yin and yang dual-configuration charts. One, two, three, and four are like the *Dunjia*’s heavenly plate above, revolving with the seasons; six, seven, eight, and nine are like the *Dunjia*’s earthly plate below, fixed and unchanging—this clarifies the principle of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness. Yet none of the earlier scholars have elucidated this intent. Thus, one begins in the south, initiating the method of heavenly images, moving and turning to the right.",

This is what the *Sequence* means by \"Heavenly One resides above, serving as the origin of the Dao.\"\n\nAccording to the *Treatise on Pitch Pipes and Calendrics*: \"Combining the two beginnings establishes firmness and softness.\" One is the beginning of yang; two is the beginning of yin. In this diagram, the upper \"heaven\" represents the image of one; the lower \"earth\" represents the image of two; the central \"heaven\" represents the Four Images and Five Phases. The upper left (one ○) is Greater Yang, the image of fire; the upper right (one •) is Lesser Yin, the image of metal; the lower left (one •) is Lesser Yang, the image of wood; the lower right (one ○) is Greater Yin, the image of water. Earth, as the balanced qi residing in the center, circulates to the four directions, initiating and propagating generation—it is both yin and yang. The three on the right represent the image of the Three Powers, the basis for drawing the trigrams; the four on the left represent the image of the Four Seasons, the basis for the milfoil’s division into four. Thus, the upper images of one, two, three, and four are the essence of the milfoil’s numbers, hexagrams, and lines.\n\nThe lower position represents forms: nine, eight, seven, and six are the full numbers of metal, wood, fire, and water; the central ten appearing in earth is the completing number of soil. From the five positions in the previous image, the central six is divided: placing one above six forms seven, placing two to the left of six forms eight, placing three to the right of six forms nine, while the lower six remains unpaired, standing alone as six. This is what the *Sequence* means by \"dividing six to form the Four Images, with earth’s six remaining unpaired.\"\n\nNote: Seven is the milfoil’s roundness, seven sevens making forty-nine; eight is the hexagram’s squareness, eight eights making sixty-four; nine is the function of yang, with yang lines totaling one hundred ninety-two; six is the function of yin, with yin lines also totaling one hundred ninety-two; ten is the number of the Great Expansion, five multiplied by ten or ten multiplied by five, both yielding fifty. Thus, the lower forms of six, seven, eight, and nine are the application of the milfoil’s numbers, hexagrams, and lines.\n\nThe upper is the essence, the lower the function; the upper is the image, the lower the form. Images move, forms are still; essence is established, function is enacted—thus the workings of creation are inexhaustible.\n\nNote: One, two, three, and four are the images of heaven, transforming above; six, seven, eight, and nine are the forms of earth, taking shape below. When above and below intersect, they form the Five Phases—this is the arrangement of left and right, front and back, generation and completion. When above and below interact, they form the eight trigrams—this is the arrangement of the four cardinal and four intercardinal directions, the nine palaces. Comparing the previous and subsequent diagrams, it should resemble the *Taiyi Dunjia*’s yin and yang dual-configuration charts. One, two, three, and four are like the *Dunjia*’s heavenly plate above, revolving with the seasons; six, seven, eight, and nine are like the *Dunjia*’s earthly plate below, fixed and unchanging—this clarifies the principle of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness. Yet none of the earlier scholars have elucidated this intent. Thus, one begins in the south, initiating the method of heavenly images, moving and turning to the right.\n\nAt the first intersection, one resides in the southeast, two in the northwest, three in the southwest, and four in the northeast—four yang numbers arrayed above to the right, four yin numbers arrayed below to the left, dividing yin and yang so that heaven and earth assume their positions. At the second intersection, one resides in the northeast, two in the southwest, three in the southeast, and four in the northwest—thus the female and male interlock, giving rise to the six child trigrams, and combining these two transformations forms the natural images of the Former Heaven eight trigrams. Then, by doubling to form the positions of generation and completion, one-six, two-seven, three-eight, and four-nine pair yin and yang respectively—this is the diagram described by Master Shao and Master Zhu.\n\nAt the third intersection, one resides in the northwest, two in the southeast, three in the northeast, and four in the southwest—thus firmness and softness intermingle, forming Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui. At the fourth intersection, one resides in the southwest, two in the northeast, three in the northwest, and four in the southeast—thus yang is to the right and yin to the left, with Qian and Kun arrayed in order, and combining these two transformations forms the cultivated positions of the Later Heaven eight trigrams. With another turn, one returns to the south. This is what the *Great Commentary* means by \"alternating threes and fives, interweaving their numbers.\"",

      "translated_text": "Liu Yinyun states: The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the eight trigrams and nine sections serve as outer and inner. Such is their significance.\n\nJiang Shiwen of Hetian remarks: The *River Diagram*’s completed numbers lie below, symbolizing the earth and its immobility, while the generative numbers symbolize the heavens’ movement, forming the trigrams. The Former Heaven eight trigrams represent natural images, and the Later Heaven eight trigrams represent cultivated positions. Observe the first intersection: the Two Modes emerge; the second intersection: the Six Children are born; the third intersection: Zhen and Dui face each other while Kan and Li mutually reside; the fourth intersection: Qian and Kun array in order while Gen and Xun occupy the corners. The sage elevates Li to the south and descends Kan to the north, thus rectifying the four directions’ positions. Placing Qian in the northwest and retiring Kun to the southwest clarifies the principle of the eldest daughter succeeding the mother. Thus, the Former Heaven reveals natural images, and the Later Heaven reveals cultivated positions—this is most evident. Though his explanation does not derive from earlier Confucians, the images and numbers are arrayed, and the principles and patterns shine forth, making it no hindrance to stand as an independent school of thought.\n\nMaster Zhu once said: In idle moments, it is good to contemplate the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*, for one may thereby achieve a flowing, dynamic understanding. Now, observing Zhongchun’s explanation, I am all the more convinced.\n\n**Diagram Three: Right—*Dragon Diagram* of Heaven-and-Earth’s Generative Numbers**\nThis is the preceding diagram.\nOne, two, three, four symbolize heaven and move in a rightward rotation; six, seven, eight, nine embody earth and remain still in their proper positions. Thus, with the first turn, one resides in the north and pairs with six; the second turn, two resides in the south and pairs with seven; the third turn, three resides in the east and pairs with eight; the fourth turn, four resides in the west and pairs with nine. Fifty resides at the center, serving as the pivot of heaven-and-earth’s movement. What the *Great Commentary* means by \"interweaving their numbers\" refers precisely to this. \"Interweaving\" (*cuo*) means crossing and mutual exchange—left and right, three and four alternating. \"Interlacing\" (*zong*) means gathering and lifting—low and high, one and two ascending and descending. Viewing this in two layers reveals the clarity of heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness, the meaning of above and below.\n\n**Diagram Four: Right—*Luo Writing* of Heaven-and-Earth’s Intersecting Numbers**\nYang Ziyun said: One and six share a common origin; two and seven form companions; three and eight are friends; four and nine follow the same path; five and five remain steadfast. This refers precisely to this diagram. Master Zhu said: Separating the unions of six, seven, eight, and nine forms Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, which occupy the four cardinal positions; following the sequence of one, two, three, and four forms Gen, Dui, Zhen, and Xun, filling the four corners’ vacancies—this aligns with these numbers. Examining the images of generation and completion, observing their divisions and unions, advances and retreats, intersections and movements, stillness and activity, it is evident that this is the image of intersecting numbers. The *Great Commentary*’s \"great expansion number fifty, whose use is forty-nine,\" the division of milfoil stalks, the formation of hexagrams, the counting and returning of the four images—seven, eight, nine, six—all imitate this.\n\n**Diagram Five: Right—*Luo Writing*’s Vertical and Horizontal Fifteen**\nThe *Hong Fan* begins: First, the Five Phases; second, reverently employing the Five Affairs; third, agriculturally employing the Eight Governances; fourth, harmoniously employing the Five Regulations; fifth, establishing the Imperial Standard; sixth, employing the Three Virtues; seventh, clearly employing divination; eighth, attentively employing the Myriad Portents; ninth, encouraging the Five Blessings and employing the Six Calamities. Han scholars took these sixty-five characters as the original text of the *Luo Writing*, while [Chen] Tuan’s transmission regarded them as the *Dragon Diagram*’s three transformations, taking the Generative-Completion Diagram as the *Luo Writing*’s original text. This likely arose from doubts about transcription errors, sparking debates over whether the diagram had nine or the writing had ten. Now, exchanging the names of these two images clarifies the *Dragon Diagram* and *Tortoise Writing* without need for further discussion.\n\nThe *Great Commentary* of the *Book of Changes* states: \"The River yields the Diagram; the Luo yields the Writing; the sage takes them as models.\" Kong Anguo said: The *River Diagram* refers to when Fuxi ruled all under heaven, a dragon-horse emerged from the River, and he took its markings to draw the eight trigrams. The *Luo Writing* refers to when Yu controlled the floods, a divine tortoise bore markings on its back, with numbers up to nine, and Yu arranged them accordingly to form the Nine Categories. Liu Xin said: Fuxi succeeded heaven to rule and received the *River Diagram*, from which he drew the eight trigrams. Yu, while controlling the floods, was granted the *Luo Writing* and modeled it to array the Nine Divisions. The *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* serve as warp and weft; the eight trigrams and nine sections serve as outer and inner.\n\nGuan Ziming said: The *River Diagram*’s markings have seven in front and six behind, eight to the left and nine to the right. The *Luo Writing*’s markings have nine in front and one behind, three to the left and seven to the right; four in front to the left, two in front to the right, eight behind to the left, six behind to the right.\n\nMaster Shao said: The circular represents the stars. Do the numbers of calendrical records originate here? The calendar combines the two beginnings to determine firmness and softness, the two middles to establish pitch standards and calendars, and the two ends to record intercalary remainders—this is what is meant by calendrical records. The square represents the earth. Do the methods of drawing provinces and well-fields imitate this? Provinces have nine wells and nine hundred *mu*—this is what is meant by drawing provinces and well-fields. The circular belongs to the *River Diagram*’s numbers; the square belongs to the *Luo Writing*’s markings. Thus, Fuxi and King Wen followed them to create the *Book of Changes*, while Yu and Jishu modeled them to compose the *Hong Fan*.\n\nHeaven one, earth two; heaven three, earth four; heaven five, earth six; heaven seven, earth eight; heaven nine, earth ten. Heaven’s numbers are five; earth’s numbers are five. The five positions mutually correspond, each having its union. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five; earth’s numbers total thirty. Altogether, heaven-and-earth’s numbers are fifty-five.",

      "translated_text": "This is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits’ workings are enacted. This passage serves to elucidate the numbers of the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing*.\n\nAll odd numbers pertain to yang, and yang is the number of Heaven; all even numbers pertain to yin, and yin is the number of Earth. Heaven’s numbers—one, three, five, seven, nine—sum to twenty-five; Earth’s numbers—two, four, six, eight, ten—sum to thirty. Combined, these yield fifty-five, and all the transformations of Heaven and Earth, the contractions and expansions of yin and yang, are encompassed within this number.\n\nThis number, when doubled, becomes the Two Modes; when triplicated, the Three Powers; when quintupled, the Five Phases; when divided, the Eight Trigrams; when exhaustively examined, the Nine Palaces—these are its essential applications.\n\nMaster Zhu said: Between Heaven and Earth, there is only qi. When divided into two, it becomes yin and yang, and the Five Phases’ transformations, the beginnings and endings of the myriad things, are all governed thereby.\n\nThe *Inner Canon* states: Yin and yang can be reckoned by tens, extended by hundreds; reckoned by thousands, extended by ten thousands. Though their vastness defies enumeration, when modeled by the *Changes*, nothing is omitted, nothing is obstructed, and all is penetrated. Through the interplay of threes and fives, their numbers are interwoven. By mastering their transformations, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are completed. By exhausting their numbers, the images of all under Heaven are determined. Who but the utmost in transformation could achieve this? This passage further elucidates the transformations of the *Diagram* and *Writing*.\n\n\"Tripling\" means interposing between two, as in the *Record*’s phrase \"do not stand or sit in threes.\" Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one, two, three, and four interposed among six, seven, eight, and nine. \"Quintupling\" means arranging in five positions, as in the military terms \"units of ten\" or \"formations of five.\" Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one, two, three, and four arranged among the earth of six, seven, eight, and nine.\n\n\"Interlacing\" means crossing and exchanging, as in alternating left and right. Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in three and four exchanging positions left and right. \"Weaving\" means interlinking and lifting, as in rising and falling. Applied to the *Diagram*’s transformations, this is seen in one and two rising and falling above and below.\n\nThrough tripling to transform, quintupling to transform, interlacing to exchange, and weaving to interlink, the patterns of Heaven and Earth are completed, and the images of all under Heaven are determined. Thus, are not the *River Diagram* and *Luo Writing* the origins of the utmost transformations under Heaven?\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, they obscurely assisted the divine luminaries to generate the milfoil stalks, weighed Heaven and Earth’s numbers to establish the calculations, observed the transformations of yin and yang to establish the trigrams, and unfolded the interplay of firm and yielding to generate the lines. They harmonized with virtue and power to order principles, and exhausted the patterns of things and the essence of natures to reach destiny. This chapter reveals the sages’ great purpose in composing the *Changes*, and the fundamental origin of the stalks’ numbers and the trigrams’ lines.\n\n\"Obscurely assisting the divine luminaries\" means that the sages purified their hearts through fasting and withdrawal, retiring into seclusion where the divine luminaries silently aided them. The forty-nine milfoil stalks were used for dividing, suspending, counting, and returning, thereby generating the yarrow stalks of yin and yang, firmness and yielding. Heaven’s and Earth’s numbers were weighed and paired to clarify the images of nine, eight, seven, and six. Thus, by observing the transformations of Heaven’s yin and yang, the trigrams’ images were established; by unfolding the interplay of Earth’s firmness and yielding, the lines’ meanings were generated. By harmonizing with virtue and power, each principle was appropriately ordered. By exhausting the patterns of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang, firmness and yielding, and fulfilling their own natures to fulfill the natures of all things, they could assist Heaven and Earth’s transformative nurturing and merge without gap with the flowing workings of creation—this was the utmost achievement of the sages’ perfect sincerity.\n\nOf old, when the sages composed the *Book of Changes*, they sought to accord with the principles of nature and destiny. Thus, they established Heaven’s Dao as yin and yang, Earth’s Dao as yielding and firm, and humanity’s Dao as benevolence and righteousness. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them, the *Changes* formed trigrams with six lines. Dividing yin and yang and alternately employing yielding and firm, the *Changes* composed hexagrams with six positions.\n\nThe sages composed the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and destiny, primarily for the sake of humanity. Thus, by observing yin and yang, they established Heaven’s Dao. Heaven’s Dao consists of cold and heat, day and night. By examining yielding and firm, they established Earth’s Dao. Earth’s Dao consists of flowing and standing, growth and vegetation. By grounding in benevolence and righteousness, they established humanity’s Dao. Humanity’s Dao consists of filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, and trustworthiness.\n\nHumanity receives the qi of yin and yang to possess life, is endowed with the qualities of firmness and yielding to possess form, and is imbued with the principles of benevolence and righteousness to complete its nature. With qi, form, and qualities fully possessed and nature complete, the Dao of the Three Powers is perfected. Thus, in the Eight Trigrams, the first line represents Earth, the middle Humanity, and the top Heaven, each differing in odd and even, combining the Three Powers and doubling them. In the hexagrams, the first and second lines represent Earth, the third and fourth Humanity, and the fifth and top Heaven. Separately considered, the first, third, and fifth positions are yang, while the second, fourth, and top are yin. Yang is firm, yin is yielding; yin and yang, firmness and yielding, alternately employed within a hexagram’s six lines, interweave to form its patterns.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* is vast and all-encompassing. It contains the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them yields six; these six are none other than the Dao of the Three Powers. The Dao undergoes changes and movements, hence the term \"lines.\" Lines have ranks, hence the term \"things.\" Things intermingle, hence the term \"patterns.\" When patterns are inappropriate, fortune and misfortune arise.",

      "translated_text": "The Dao is the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Heaven’s alternation of yin and yang gives rise to five, while Earth’s alternation of yielding and firm gives rise to ten. When five and ten are doubled, they form the lines—this is what is meant by \"change and movement.\" The lines are what imitate this; the lines are what imitate the movements of all under Heaven. \"Ranks\" refer to gradations. The character for \"rank\" (等) is composed of \"bamboo\" (竹), signifying counting rods, and \"ten\" (十) with \"one\" (一), marking the beginning and end of numbers. To calculate without holding the rods is the meaning of \"pointing to the matter\" (指事). An old interpretation derives \"rank\" from \"equal\" (等), but this offers no meaningful insight, so it is here corrected.\n\nThe lines’ activity and stillness possess ranks—first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top—and distinctions of seven, eight, nine, and six, hence the term \"things.\" \"Things\" are temporal entities. Seven and nine are odd, and all things that are yang, whose substance is firm, belong to *Qian*’s domain. Six and eight are even, and all things that are yin, whose substance is yielding, belong to *Kun*’s domain. Separately considered, nine is yang and six is yin; seven is firm and eight is yielding. Yin and yang are images; firmness and yielding are forms. Thus, nine and six change, while seven and eight do not—lines employ nine and six to emphasize change. It is also said: the milfoil number is seven, the trigrams number eight. The bodies of firmness and yielding establish *Qian*’s lines as nine and *Kun*’s lines as six, through which the functions of yin and yang operate. Yin and yang unite in virtue, firmness and yielding possess form, interweaving to create patterns. \"Patterns\" (文) are the warp and weft of culture. The character for \"pattern\" (文) derives from the crossing of lines (×), an image of yin and yang intersecting.\n\nWhen patterns are appropriate, fortune arises: to dwell in correctness, to move with moderation, is to align with the fittingness of things, and thus fortune is born. The character for \"fortune\" (吉) is composed of \"ten\" (十), signifying yin transforming into yang, and \"mouth\" (口), signifying yang transforming into yin. The phonetic element \"one\" (一) resides within change and movement; when change attains correctness, it becomes fortune—this is the meaning of the compound. As the *Book of Documents* says: \"Virtue, when it moves but once, is without exception fortunate.\" The *Commentary* states: \"All movements under Heaven are steadfast in the One.\" Wang Luzhai of Jinhua interpreted the character for \"fortune\" as the image of old yang emerging from the earth.\n\nWhen patterns are inappropriate, misfortune arises: to dwell without moderation, to move without correctness, is to fall into pits and traps, and thus misfortune is born. The character for \"misfortune\" (凶) is composed of \"pit\" (㐫), signifying movement, and \"mouth\" (口), signifying movement that falls into the pit, losing its central correctness and becoming misfortune. \"Pit\" (㐫) is a trap—this is the meaning of the compound. Wang Luzhai of Jinhua interpreted the character for \"misfortune\" as the image of old yin entering the earth. Thus it is said: fortune, misfortune, regret, and remorse arise from movement.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram Explanations, Inner Chapters, Volume One (concluded)**\n\n**Diagram Explanations, Inner Chapters, Volume Two**\n*Composed by Zhang Lizhong, a later scholar of Qingjiang*\n\n**Original Trigram Drawing 1**\n*Right: The Image of the Supreme Ultimate Giving Birth to the Two Modes*\nThe *Book of Changes* originally had neither *Qian* nor *Kun*, only this single line (一). When the Supreme Ultimate divided, the light and pure qi floated upward to become Heaven, while the heavy and turbid qi congealed downward to become Earth. The Sage looked up and observed, looked down and examined, received the *River Diagram*, and accordingly drew the trigrams: representing Heaven (○) with a single unbroken line (一), and Earth (一) with a single broken line (一). The unbroken line was named \"odd\" and designated yang; the broken line was named \"even\" and designated yin. This arrangement—odd above and even below—is the fixed positions of Heaven and Earth. The central five is the intersection of Heaven and Earth’s qi, the root of the Four Images, Eight Trigrams, and the transformation and generation of the myriad things. As the *Record of Music* states: \"One movement and one stillness—such is the space between Heaven and Earth.\" Master Zhou said: \"The Supreme Ultimate moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, stillness arises. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, movement resumes. Movement and stillness alternate as each other’s root. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established.\"\n\n**Original Trigram Drawing 2**\n*Right: The Image of the Two Modes Giving Birth to the Four Images*\nThe *Book of Changes* originally had no Eight Trigrams, only this *Qian* and *Kun*. Master Zhu said: The yang mode generates an odd line to form Greater Yang, and an even line to form Lesser Yin. The yin mode generates an odd line to form Lesser Yang, and an even line to form Greater Yin. In the old diagram, the Four Images were arranged evenly, endlessly generating. In the present diagram, the yang mode generates one odd and one even line below, forming yin and yang; the yin mode generates one odd and one even line above, forming firmness and yielding. The Four Images revolve in a circle, endlessly cycling. Firmness intersects with yin, yin with firmness; yang intersects with yielding, yielding with yang. Above and below, left and right intersect, and the myriad things are born. Master Zhou said: \"Yang transforms and yin unites, giving rise to water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The five qi are distributed in order, and the four seasons proceed.\" The *Commentary* states: \"The Dao of Heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of Earth is established as yielding and firm.\" This is what is meant.\n\n*Right: The Two Modes Giving Birth to the Four Images*\nThe yin mode generates an odd line above, forming Lesser Yang. Lesser Yang is yang within yin. The yang qi of the east generates things; in terms of time, it is spring. \"Spring\" (春) means \"stirring\" (蠢): things stir and come to life, thus enabling movement, hence it is centered on the compass. In Heaven it is wind, on Earth it is wood, above it is Jupiter, in virtue it is *yuan* (origin). *Yuan* is the chief of goodness. In the body it is the sinews, in the organs it is the liver, and it connects to the eyes.",
      "overlap_context": "lines, interweave to form its patterns.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* is vast and all-encompassing. It contains the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. Combining the Three Powers and doubling them yields six; these six are none other than the Dao of the Three Powers. The Dao undergoes changes and movements, hence the term \"lines.\" Lines have ranks, hence the term \"things.\" Things intermingle, hence the term \"patterns.\" When patterns are inappropriate, fortune and misfortune arise.",

In Heaven it is cold, on Earth it is water, above it is Mercury, in virtue it is *zhen* (integrity). *Zhen* is the trunk of affairs. In the body it is the bones, in the organs it is the kidneys, and it connects to the ears. In disposition it is fear; its sound is groaning; its color is black; its flavor is salty; its note is *yu* (羽); its livestock is the pig; its grain is beans; its number is six, the consummate number of water.\n\nThe center is the midst of yin and yang, the interior of the four directions.

In Heaven it is dampness, on Earth it is soil, above it is Saturn, in virtue it is *cheng* (sincerity). Master Zhou said: \"*Yuan heng* (origin and prosperity) are the penetration of sincerity; *li zhen* (benefit and integrity) are the return of sincerity.\" In the body it is the flesh, in the organs it is the spleen, and it connects to the mouth. In disposition it is thought; its sound is singing; its color is yellow; its flavor is sweet; its note is *gong* (宫); its livestock is the ox; its grain is millet; its number is five, the generative number of soil.\n\n*Trigram lines: three*\n*Right: The Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nThe *Yi* originally had sixty-four hexagrams, but only these eight trigrams. In ancient times, when Fuxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the images in Heaven and looked down to observe the patterns on Earth. He examined the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, taking from his own body and from distant things. Thereupon he first created the eight trigrams to communicate with the virtue of the numinous and to categorize the conditions of the myriad things. Between Heaven and Earth, there was originally the character \"Heaven\" (天).\n\n*Right: The Reason the Sage Created the Trigrams*\nThe *Yi* has the Supreme Polarity, which gives birth to the Two Modes; the Two Modes give birth to the Four Images; the Four Images give birth to the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give birth to great undertakings.\n\n*Right: The Purpose of the Sage in Drawing the Trigrams*\nThe Four Images: when yang descends to interact with yielding and yielding ascends to interact with yang, they form *Qian* and *Kun* (Heaven and Earth in their positions), *Gen* and *Dui* (Mountain and Marsh communicating qi). When firm ascends to interact with yin and yin descends to interact with firm, they form *Zhen* and *Xun* (Thunder and Wind clashing), *Kan* and *Li* (Water and Fire not overcoming each other). Heaven holds yang, suspending the sun and stars—*Li* as the sun, *Dui* as the stars. In Heaven, one looks up and observes in reverse, thus *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen*—the four images of Heaven—are generated from above downward. Earth holds yin, opening mountains and rivers—*Gen* as mountains, *Kan* as rivers. On Earth, one looks down and observes in sequence, thus *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun*—the four images of Earth—are generated from below upward. The eight trigrams intermingle: those above interact to the left, those below interact to the right, so that *Qian* is south and *Kun* is north, *Li* is east and *Kan* is west, and the image of the circular diagram of the Earlier Heaven Eight Trigrams is revealed. When *Zhen* and *Gen* observe each other, reversing *Zhen* makes *Gen* and reversing *Gen* makes *Zhen*, then *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* occupy the corners, while *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, and *Dui* occupy the center, and the image of the square diagram of the Later Heaven Eight Trigrams is revealed. Thereupon, movement and stillness mutually support each other, earlier and later intermingle, circular and square alternate in function, and the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation cannot be fully expressed.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Qian* and *Kun* are the great parents\" (see the Four Images Diagram); \"*Fu* and *Gou* are the small parents\" (see the Eight Trigrams Diagram). The *Yi* is rooted in *Qian* and *Kun* yet born from *Gou* and *Fu*. For when firm interacts with yielding, it becomes *Fu*; when yielding interacts with firm, it becomes *Gou*. From this, it is inexhaustible. He also said: \"Among the images of the eight trigrams, four do not change—*Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*; two reverse—*Zhen* reverses to become *Gen*, *Dui* reverses to become *Xun*—thus six change to form eight.\"\n\n*Trigram lines: four*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nThe yang mode above interacts to the left, the yin mode below interacts to the right, and thus this diagram is formed. Master Kangjie said: \"Kun in the north, Qian in the south, Li in the east, Kan in the west, Zhen in the northeast, Dui in the southeast, Xun in the southwest, Gen in the northwest\" refers to this. The circle (○) in the center is the Supreme Polarity; the two (--) are the Two Modes. The previous images determine the positions of odd and even lines by the above and below of Heaven and Earth, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams, all converging at the center. This is what is meant by \"gathering them does not fill a fist, yet the ten thousand differences share one root.\"",

Scholars who empty their minds to contemplate this, turn inward to embody it, truly perceive this principle, and truly attain this Way, will silently accomplish it. Then the subtleties of virtue, power, nature, and destiny, and the origins of ritual, music, punishment, and governance—none transcend this.\n\n*Trigram lines: five*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams*\nWhen the four central trigrams are viewed in reverse, they become Zhen, Dui, Kan, and Li; when the four peripheral trigrams are viewed directly, they become Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun. Thus, in this image, Kan, Li, Zhen, and Dui occupy the cardinal directions, while Qian, Kun, Gen, and Xun reside in the four corners. Comparing this to the *Hetu*: one and six dwell in the north as water, and Kan corresponds to it—Kan is water. Two and seven dwell in the south as fire, and Li corresponds to it—Li is fire. Three and eight dwell in the east as wood, and Zhen corresponds to it—Zhen is thunder, active in spring. Four and nine dwell in the west as metal, and Dui corresponds to it—Dui is marsh, observed in autumn. Qian is cold and ice, positioned in the northwest, adjoining Dui as metal. Xun is rising and wind, positioned in the southeast, adjoining Zhen as wood. Five and ten dwell in the center as earth, and Kun (earth) and Gen (mountain) are assigned to it. Kun is yin, so by analogy it retreats to the southwest; Gen is yang, so by analogy it is established in the northeast. This is how the positions of the *houtian* Eight Trigrams are determined. Thus, harmonizing with celestial timing, verifying with terrestrial advantage, and examining human affairs, the sequence of the four qi’s movements can be known. The *Shuo Gua* states: \"Gen is where the myriad things complete their end and begin their inception.\" Things cannot be without a ruler, so the Di emerges from Zhen. Zhen is the east, where the sun rises. None is more fitting to hold the vessel than the eldest son; when the eldest son takes office, the eldest daughter is paired with him, hence it is followed by Xun, resembling the eldest son and his principal wife. When the household is ordered, the state is governed; from the household extending to the state, hence it is followed by Li. Li is brightness. The sage faces south to listen, and all under Heaven is greatly illuminated—this is the image of the sun at midday. When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines, hence it is followed by Kun. Kun is compliance. To exert labor in Kun is the meaning of resting from work, hence it is followed by Dui. Dui is the west, where the sun sets. Approaching dusk, one retires to rest, hence it is said: \"joyful words in Dui.\" It is then followed by Qian. Qian is yang, the northwest, the direction of yin. Yin and yang contend, hence it is said: \"strife in Qian.\" It is followed by Kan. Kan is water, the trigram of the true north; the time of midnight, the image of deep yin, hence it is said: \"toil in Kan.\" After toil comes accomplishment, hence it is said: \"completion in Gen,\" and it concludes with Gen.\n\n*Trigram lines: six*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Four Images Giving Birth to the Eight Trigrams, with the left and right four trigrams transposed*\nQian, Li, Kan, and Kun occupy the center, resembling the head, eyes, heart, and abdomen; Zhen, Gen, Xun, and Dui occupy the left and right, resembling the hands, feet, thighs, and arms. Master Xiyi considered this a convergence of form and category. For humanity is the conjoined qi of Heaven and Earth. \"Only the August One bestows the centered nature, as if there were a constant nature.\" Thus, all who discourse on the Dao trace it to this. The *Za Gua* states: \"Qian is firm, Kun is yielding; Li above, Kan below; Dui manifests, Xun conceals; Zhen arises, Gen halts.\" Examining this, the *Cantong Qi* says: \"Qian and Kun are the gates and portals of the Changes, the parents of all trigrams. Kan and Li are the enclosing frame, the axle and hub of the turning wheel. The four trigrams of the female and male are the bolts and keys.\" This, too, is derived from this. Hence, it is here set forth and transmitted.\n\n*Trigram lines: seven*\n*Right: The Diagram of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams in Cyclic Rotation*\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: \"Heaven and Earth establish their positions; mountain and marsh communicate qi; thunder and wind contend; water and fire do not oppose each other—thus the Eight Trigrams intermingle.\" \"Counting what has passed proceeds in sequence; knowing what is to come proceeds in reverse. Thus the Changes are reckoned in reverse.\" *Right: The image of the Xiantian sixty-four hexagrams in a circular diagram.* Heaven and Earth establish their positions: Qian in the south, Kun in the north. Heaven is honored above, Earth is humble below. Mountain and marsh communicate qi: mountain stabilizes the northwest, marsh pours into the southeast. Thunder and wind contend: thunder emerges in the northeast, wind flourishes in the southwest. Water and fire do not oppose each other: Li descends in the east, where the great brightness of the sun is born; Kan ascends in the west, where the lesser brightness of the moon is born.",
      "overlap_context": "an in the west, Zhen in the northeast, Dui in the southeast, Xun in the southwest, Gen in the northwest\" refers to this. The circle (○) in the center is the Supreme Polarity; the two (--) are the Two Modes. The previous images determine the positions of odd and even lines by the above and below of Heaven and Earth, the Four Images, and the Eight Trigrams, all converging at the center. This is what is meant by \"gathering them does not fill a fist, yet the ten thousand differences share one root.\"",

      "translated_text": "Here the discourse speaks of inner images, emphasizing stillness and the stabilization of positions. The eight trigrams intermingle—*cuo* meaning they intersect and mutually transform, alternating left and right. Qian intersects with Xun, and Xun with Qian; Kan with Dui, and Dui with Kan; Li with Gen, and Gen with Li; Kun with Zhen, and Zhen with Kun. Qian, Dui, Li, and Zhen—the trigrams of the yang axis—originally occupy the left side, yet now intersect to reside above the right-side yin axis. Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun—the trigrams of the yin axis—originally occupy the right side, yet now intersect to reside above the left-side yang axis. Thus hardness and softness grind against each other, the eight trigrams surge and shift, giving rise to boundless transformation. Further elaboration appears below.\n\nHere the discourse speaks of outer images, emphasizing movement and the pursuit of timeliness. Through circular rotation and mutual impulsion, the sixty-four hexagrams take form, encircling the eight directions—just as the twenty-eight lunar lodges are distributed among the twelve earthly branches. Thus, when reckoned by moving rightward, the eight trigrams Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Kun, Gen, Kan, and Xun proceed from inner to outer, like a ring without end.\n\n\"Counting what has passed proceeds in sequence\": *passed* refers to the hexagrams that have already transpired; *sequence* means following the order of the eight trigrams, as when one counts backward from today to previous days, or from the winter solstice to the preceding Beginning of Winter and Autumn Equinox—thus from Kun to Gen, to Kan, to Xun, to Qian, all counted in their proper sequence.\n\n\"Knowing what is to come proceeds in reverse\": *to come* refers to the hexagrams yet to arrive; *reverse* means reversing the order of the eight trigrams, as when one reckons forward from today to future days, or from the winter solstice toward the coming Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox—thus from Kun to Zhen, to Li, to Dui, to Qian, all known by reversing their sequence.\n\nYet all reckoning in the *Changes* proceeds in reverse: lines are generated from bottom to top, hexagrams are counted from right to left. Hence it is said: \"The *Changes* are reckoned in reverse.\"\n\nExamining this diagram: the Xiantian diagram is first upright, then inverted. The lower eight trigrams remain still and hold their positions, while the upper eight trigrams move and rotate rightward. Thus hardness and softness grind against each other, the eight trigrams surge and shift, one *zhen* giving rise to eight *hui*. Eight times eight make sixty-four hexagrams, intersecting left and right.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Zhen Palace: Zhen intersects with Kun, beginning with Fu, then Zhen, Shi Ke, Sui, Wu Wang, Yi, Tun, and ending with Yi, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Zhen below, Gen above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Li Palace: Li intersects with Gen, beginning with Bi, then Ming Yi, Feng, Li, Ge, Tong Ren, Jia Ren, and ending with Ji Ji, where yin and yang intermingle at the center. Li below, Kan above—three yang and three yin, day and night in equal balance.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Dui Palace: Dui intersects with Kan, beginning with Jie, then Sun, Lin, Gui Mei, Kui, Dui, Lü, and ending with Zhong Fu, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Dui below, Xun above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Qian Palace: Qian intersects with Xun, beginning with Xiao Xu, then Xu, Da Xu, Tai, Da Zhuang, Da You, Guai, and ending with Qian, reaching the extreme of the six-yang pure-body hexagram. This is the left side of the diagram.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Xun Palace: Xun intersects with Qian, beginning with Gou, then Xun, Jing, Gu, Sheng, Heng, Ding, and ending with Da Guo, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Xun below, Dui above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Kan Palace: Kan intersects with Dui, beginning with Kun, then Song, Huan, Kan, Meng, Shi, Jie, and ending with Wei Ji, where hardness and softness are evenly divided. Kan below, Li above—three hard and three soft, day and night in perfect balance.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Gen Palace: Gen intersects with Li, beginning with Lü, then Xian, Dun, Jian, Jian, Gen, Qian, and ending with Xiao Guo, where the images of *zhen* and *hui* stand in opposition. Gen below, Zhen above—two images in opposition.\n\nThe eight hexagrams of the Kun Palace: Kun intersects with Zhen, beginning with Yu, then Jin, Cui, Pi, Guan, Bi, Bo, and ending with Kun, completing the cycle of the six-yin pure-body hexagram. This is the right side of the diagram.\n\nViewed in a circle, the hexagrams Qian, Kun, Tai, Pi, Kan, Li, Ji Ji, Wei Ji, Sui, Gu, Jian, Gui Mei, Yi, Da Guo, Zhong Fu, and Xiao Guo—sixteen in all—alternate and oppose each other, their three positions interspersed like strung pearls or a net with its guiding cords, ordered yet not disordered. Such is the marvel of their natural arrangement, not something that human effort could contrive.\n\nThus, considering the solar terms of a year: Zhen first intersects with Kun, the hexagram of the winter solstice where one yang is born. Kun transforms into Fu, so Qian begins at the initial nine of Fu and ends at the noon position. Xun first diminishes Qian, the hexagram of the summer solstice where one yin is born. Qian transforms into Gou, so Kun begins at the initial six of Gou and ends at the midnight position. Qian and Kun establish the positions of above and below: at the winter solstice, Kun transforms, yin is abundant, cold prevails, days are shortest and nights longest; at the summer solstice, Qian transforms, yang is abundant, heat prevails, days are longest and nights shortest. The two solstices are the convergence of yin and yang. Qian and Kun intersect at the center to form Kan and Li; Kan and Li intersect to form Ji Ji and Wei Ji. Ji Ji and Wei Ji intersect at the midpoint between south and north: at the spring equinox, Ji Ji transforms into Jie, so Kan begins at the nine in the second place of Jie and ends at the west position. At the autumn equinox, Wei Ji transforms into Lü, so Li begins at the six in the second place of Lü and ends at the east position.",

      "translated_text": "The three yang and three yin achieve balanced warmth and cold, with day and night in equal measure—at the spring and autumn equinoxes, yin and yang part ways. At the onset of spring, *Yi* transforms into *Bi*, where *Yi* has two yang lines externally and four yin lines internally. At the onset of summer, *Zhong Fu* transforms into *Xiao Xu*, where *Zhong Fu* has four yang lines externally and two yin lines internally. Thus, in spring and summer, yang resides externally while yin remains within—this is the time when the sage nurtures yang. At the onset of autumn, *Da Guo* transforms into *Kun*, where *Da Guo* has two yin lines externally and four yang lines internally. At the onset of winter, *Xiao Guo* transforms into *Yu*, where *Xiao Guo* has four yin lines externally and two yang lines internally. Thus, in autumn and winter, yang resides within while yin envelops externally—this is the time when the sage nurtures yin. Here, the seasonal nodes of the annual celestial cycle are fully represented in the diagram, as Shaozi (Shao Yong) meant when he spoke of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and the waxing and waning of day and night, all deriving from this.\n\nExtending this to the phases of a single month: when *Kun* is doubled, it marks the transition between the dark moon and the new moon, gradually giving rise to brightness. In *Xiao Guo*, *Zhen* is opposed by the second *Zhen*, appearing at dusk on the third day in the west at *geng*. In *Da Guo*, *Dui* is opposed by the second *Dui*, appearing as the first quarter moon on the eighth day in the south at *ding*. By the fifteenth day, the *Qian* hexagram reaches its fullness at the full moon, rising in the east at *jia*, then gradually waning. In *Zhong Fu*, *Xun* is opposed by the second *Xun*, visible at dawn on the eighteenth day in the west at *xin*. In the *Yi* hexagram, *Gen* is opposed by the second *Gen*, marking the last quarter moon on the twenty-third day directly south at *bing*. Thus, the lunar phases of the month are fully represented in the diagram, as Shaozi meant when he spoke of the dark moon, new moon, quarters, and full moon, and the waxing, waning, progression, and recession of the moon, all deriving from this.\n\nTo the northeast lies the *Gen* hexagram, where all things reach their completion and begin anew. Thus, the hexagram of the winter solstice concludes with *Gen* (Mountain Thunder *Yi*), while the node of the onset of spring begins with *Gen* (Mountain Fire *Bi*)—this is the natural order of numbers. Hence it is said: *\"The Changes correspond to heaven and earth.\"* Shaozi remarked: *\"Though the diagram bears no text, I speak all day without ever departing from it, for the principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things are all contained within.\"* Zhu Xi said: *\"The Primordial Heaven diagram, when applied to the cycle of a year, is vast—yet even the span of 129,600 years of antiquity follows this same circle. When applied to a single day of twelve hours, it is small—yet it too follows this same circle, all beginning from *Fu* and unfolding onward.\"*\n\nThe *Commentary* states: *\"Heaven is noble, earth is humble—thus Qian and Kun are established. The humble and noble are arrayed in order, and the positions of the honored and base are set. Movement and stillness follow constant patterns, and the firm and yielding are determined. Things gather by kind, beings group by species—thus fortune and misfortune arise. In heaven, images take form; on earth, shapes are made manifest—thus transformations appear.\"*\n\nTherefore, the firm and yielding grind against one another, and the eight trigrams stir into motion. They are roused by thunder and lightning, moistened by wind and rain; the sun and moon move in their courses, alternating between cold and heat. The Dao of Qian gives rise to the male, and the Dao of Kun gives rise to the female.\n\n*(The above is the first chapter of the \"Great Appendix,\" elucidating the meaning of the sixty-four hexagrams in the Primordial Heaven circular diagram.)*\n\n*\"Heaven is noble, earth is humble—thus Qian and Kun are established.\"* Heaven is clear and resides above; earth is turbid and lies below. The noble above and the humble below—thus the positions of Qian and Kun are fixed. *\"The humble and noble are arrayed in order, and the positions of the honored and base are set.\"* Yang is noble, yin is humble; the ruler is honored, the minister is base. Each takes its proper place, and the ranks of the noble and base are thereby distinguished. *\"Movement and stillness follow constant patterns, and the firm and yielding are determined.\"* The external moves while the internal is still; yang moves while yin is still. Each adheres to its constant nature, and the principles of the firm and yielding are thus distinguished.\n\nThose above align with heaven, and those below align with earth. The hexagrams *Qian*, *Dui*, *Li*, and *Zhen* gather in the southeast, while *Kun*, *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Xun* gather in the northwest. The beings corresponding to the eight trigrams likewise follow their hexagrams in classification—horses, oxen, sheep, and pigs each form their own groups. Thus, *\"things gather by kind, beings group by species.\"*\n\nMaster He Sha Zheng said: *\"Animals belong to yang, plants belong to yin. Those that move cannot take root, for they incline toward yang. Those that take root cannot move, for they incline toward yin. The beings of yin and yang are thus grouped by these distinctions. Only humans can move upright and take root while moving, possessing the fullness of yin and yang—hence they are more spiritually endowed than other beings.\"*\n\n*Qian* is yang within yang, representing the flock of birds and beasts. *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Zhen* are yang within yin, representing the swarm of insects and fish. *Kun* is yin within yin, representing the mass of earth and stone. *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui* are yin within yang, representing the cluster of grasses and trees. Yin and yang, firmness and yielding, good and evil—each gathers and separates, and thus fortune and misfortune arise.\n\nFortune and misfortune are the images of gain and loss. When rain, sunshine, warmth, cold, and wind—these five—arrive in due season, it is the image of good fortune. When one is in extreme abundance and another in extreme absence, it is the image of misfortune. The gains and losses of affairs and things, and the signs of prosperity and decline, give rise to fortune and misfortune—this is no different.\n\nIn heaven, images take form: the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. On earth, shapes are made manifest: water, fire, wood, and metal. Images appear in heaven, shapes form on earth—thus the traces of transformation are revealed.\n\nThe firm and yielding grind against one another: one, seven, three, and nine are firm; two, six, four, and eight are yielding. *Mo* means to grind and polish—knowing that the grinding and turning of these numbers generate the eight trigrams. The eight trigrams stir into motion: *dang* means to shake and move, as when water washes a vessel, swirling and stirring it. *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, *Li*, *Zhen*, *Gen*, *Xun*, and *Dui* interact to form the sixty-four hexagrams. They are roused by thunder and lightning—this is the image of *Zhen* and *Gen*. They are moistened by wind and rain—this is the image of *Xun* and *Dui*.",

      "translated_text": "The sun and moon move in their courses—this is the image of *Kan* and *Li*. One cycle of cold and heat: when the sun travels farthest south, it is cold; when it travels nearest north, it is hot—these are the images formed by transformation. The Way of *Qian* forms the male, the Way of *Kun* forms the female—these are the shapes formed by transformation. By examining the diagrams, one grasps more than half the meaning.\n\nTo the right: the sixty-four hexagrams formed by doubling the eight trigrams.\n\n*The Explanation of the Trigrams* states: Thunder moves them, wind disperses them, rain moistens them, the sun warms them, *Gen* halts them, *Dui* delights them, *Qian* rules them, *Kun* conceals them.\n\nTo the right: the images of the sixty-four hexagrams in the *Prior Heaven* square diagram.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"All diagrams begin from the center.\"\nNow consider: \"Thunder moves them, wind disperses them\"—these occupy the center of this diagram and the four cardinal directions. \"Rain moistens them, the sun warms them\"—thus *Kan* follows *Xun*, and *Li* follows *Zhen*. \"*Gen* halts them, *Dui* delights them\"—thus *Gen* follows *Kan*, and *Dui* follows *Li*. \"*Qian* rules them, *Kun* conceals them\"—thus *Qian* follows *Dui*, and *Kun* follows *Gen*. All proceed from the center to the exterior, so left and right, above and below, vertically and horizontally, all interrelate. Thus the positions of the sixty-four hexagrams are determined.\n\nThe southeast is the yang direction, and *Qian* resides there—*Qian* is the hexagram of the fourth month, so its position is at *si*. The northwest is the yin direction, and *Kun* resides there—*Kun* is the hexagram of the tenth month, so its position is at *hai*. *Tai* is the hexagram of the first month, so its position is at *yin*. *Pi* is the hexagram of the seventh month, so its position is at *shen*. These are the four corner positions of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*.\n\nAt the winter solstice, when the yang begins to grow at *zi*, the hexagram *Fu* aligns with it—*Fu* is the hexagram of the eleventh month. At the summer solstice, when the yin begins to grow at *wu*, the hexagram *Gou* aligns with it—*Gou* is the hexagram of the fifth month. At the spring equinox, at *mao*, the hexagram *Da Zhuang* corresponds to the second month. At the autumn equinox, at *you*, the hexagram *Guan* corresponds to the eighth month. These are the four cardinal positions of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.\n\nThe months of *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei* have hexagrams that reside in the corners, attached to the four cardinal directions. *Lin*, the hexagram of the twelfth month, pairs with *Tai*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, it is at *chou*. *Yin* receives *Gen*, so its position is in the northeast. *Guai*, the hexagram of the third month, is close to *Qian*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *chen* and *si* receive *Xun*, and their position is in the southeast. *Dun*, the hexagram of the sixth month, is near *Pi*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *wei* and *shen* receive *Kun*, and their position is in the southwest. *Bo*, the hexagram of the ninth month, neighbors *Kun*, so in the *Later Heaven* arrangement, *xu* and *hai* receive *Qian*, and their position is in the northwest, corresponding to the earth’s directions.\n\nIf one observes with *Qian* above and *Kun* below, the eight trigrams serve as the warp, and the fifty-six hexagrams to the left and right serve as the weft—this is what the *Commentary* means by \"Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the *Changes* operate within them.\" If one observes with *Pi* above and *Tai* below, the eight trigrams form ranks, and the fifty-six hexagrams intermingle above and below—this is what the *Commentary* means by \"*Qian* and *Kun* form ranks, and the *Changes* are established within them.\"\n\nThe twenty-eight hexagrams around the perimeter correspond to the twenty-eight constellations of heaven. From *Qian* to *Da Xu*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven eastern constellations of the Azure Dragon: *Jiao* begins at *Qian*, so *chen* aligns with *Kang* (Metal Dragon), and *mao* aligns with *Fang* (Sun Hare). From *Tai* to *Qian*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven northern constellations of the Dark Warrior: *chou* aligns with *Niu* (Metal Ox), and *zi* aligns with *Xu* (Sun Rat). From *Kun* to *Cui*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven western constellations of the White Tiger: *xu* aligns with *Lou* (Metal Dog), and *you* aligns with *Mao* (Sun Rooster). From *Pi* to *Lü*, seven hexagrams in all, they correspond to the seven southern constellations of the Vermilion Bird: *wei* aligns with *Gui* (Metal Sheep), and *wu* aligns with *Xing* (Sun Horse).\n\nThus it is said: \"In heaven, images are formed; on earth, shapes are made.\" And the *Tuan* commentary on *Bi* states: \"Observe the patterns of heaven to examine the changes of the seasons; observe the patterns of humanity to transform and perfect the world.\"\n\n*The Kinship of the Three* says:\nAt the new moon, *Fu* arises, and the yang qi begins to flow.\nEntering and exiting without haste, set up the gnomon to detect its subtle strength.\nWhen the Yellow Bell establishes *zi*, the first signs flourish.\nScatter warmth and softness, and the millet and mugwort thrive as usual.\nApply the firing times to the furnace, open the path to proper illumination.\nThe radiance gradually advances, and the days grow longer.\nAt *chou*, the Great Pitch, balance is established, high and low.\nRaising it forms *Tai*, where firm and yielding prosper together.\nYin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives.\nThe spokes converge at *yin*, moving in accord with the seasons.\nGradually passing through *Da Zhuang*, they flank the gate of *mao*.\nThe elm pods fall, returning to their root.\nPunishment and virtue alternate, and day and night begin to divide.\n*Guai* retreats with the yin, while the yang ascends forward.\nWash the wings, shake off the dust of the roost.\n*Qian* is vigorous and bright, widely covering the four neighbors.\nThe yang ends at *si*, ending yet interacting.\n*Gou* begins the lineage, treading frost first.\nThe cold spring at the well’s bottom—*wu* is the *Ruibin*.\nThe guest submits to the yin, and the yin becomes the host.\n*Dun* departs from its position, gathering its essence.\nCherishing virtue and awaiting the time, it dwells in obscurity.\n*Pi* is closed and impassable, and what sprouts does not grow.\nThe yin extends, the yang withdraws, and the yang’s name is lost.\nObserve its radiant light, examine the conditions of mid-autumn.\nNurture the tender and young, and the old and withered flourish again.\nShepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, together covering and growing.\n*Bo* decays the limbs, dissolving its form.\nThe transforming qi is exhausted, and the utmost spirit is lost.\nWhen the Dao reaches its limit, it returns—back to the origin of *Kun*.\nEver following the patterns of earth, it receives heaven and spreads forth.\nDark and distant, faint and subtle, separated yet connected.\nResponding to measure and nurturing life, they are the source of yin and yang.\nVast and indistinct, none know their beginning.\nThose who first lose the track later become the lords.",

      "translated_text": "The *Commentary* states: Hardness and softness establish the root. Transformation and adaptation follow the times. Fortune and misfortune arise from constancy prevailing. The Dao of heaven and earth is constancy in observation. The Dao of sun and moon is constancy in illumination. All movement under heaven is constancy in unity.\n\nThe above *Commentary* elucidates the meaning of the sixty-four hexagrams’ transformations in the Posterior Heaven arrangement. Hardness and softness are the fundamental substance of transformation. Transformation and adaptation are the timely application of hardness and softness. Examining this through the diagram: *Qian* is hard and *Kun* is soft, positioned above and below—these are the unchanging, fixed forms. Thus it is said: Hardness and softness establish the root. When the initial line of *Kun* softens and advances toward hardness, it becomes *Fu*, *Lin*, *Tai*, *Dazhuang*, and *Guai*, reaching its extreme as *Qian*, progressing from winter to summer. When the initial line of *Qian* hardens and shifts toward softness, it becomes *Gou*, *Dun*, *Pi*, *Guan*, and *Bo*, retreating to its extreme as *Kun*, moving from summer to winter. Thus it is said: Transformation and adaptation follow the times.\n\nTherefore, when *Qian* and *Kun* transform through their initial lines, the hexagrams of one yin and one yang each number six, all derived from *Fu* and *Gou*. When they transform through their second lines, the hexagrams of two yin and two yang each number fifteen, all derived from *Lin* and *Dun*. When they transform through their third lines, the hexagrams of three yin and three yang each number twenty, all derived from *Tai* and *Pi*. When they transform through their fourth lines, the hexagrams of four yin and four yang each number fifteen, all derived from *Dazhuang* and *Guan*. When they transform through their fifth lines, the hexagrams of five yin and five yang each number six, all derived from *Guai* and *Bo*. Vertically and horizontally, forward and backward, they mutually derive from one another without exception. If one understands their transformations, there is no rigidity, and nothing is impassable. As the *Commentary* says: \"Movement does not abide; it circulates through the six positions. Above and below have no constancy; hardness and softness interchange. One cannot rely on fixed principles; only adaptation to change suffices.\"\n\nYet yang governs advance, ascending leftward from *Fu*; yin governs retreat, descending rightward from *Gou*. In *Tai* and *Pi*, yin and yang are evenly divided: from *yin* to *shen*, all is day, and *Qian* truly envelops it; from *you* to *chou*, all is night, and *Kun* truly sustains it. Thus the *Great Appendix* states: \"Transformation and change are the images of advance and retreat; hardness and softness are the images of day and night.\" Whether hard or soft, there are losses and gains, and the principles of fortune and misfortune constantly prevail over one another.\n\n*Qian* above and *Kun* below, their forms fixed and unchanging—this is the Dao of heaven and earth, constancy in observation. *Li* in the south and *Kan* in the north: the sun shines by day, the moon appears by night—this is the Dao of sun and moon, constancy in illumination. All movement under heaven is endlessly changing; following principle brings fortune, opposing it brings misfortune. What is correct and constant is unified by constancy—this is but one principle.\n\nFollowing Master Zhu’s interpretation of the *Cantong Qi*, which takes *Qian* and *Kun* as the cauldron and vessel, *Kan* and *Li* as the medicinal ingredients, and the remaining sixty hexagrams as the firing times, this diagram may be understood as aligning the human body with the yin and yang of heaven and earth. *Qian* is the head and resides above; *Kun* is the abdomen and resides below. *Li* is the heart, *Kan* the kidneys. The heart is fire, the kidneys water—thus *Li* is above and *Kan* below. Yang arises from *Fu*, ascending leftward along the human *du mai*, the yang vessel, which rises from the coccyx along the spine to the head. Yin arises from *Gou*, descending rightward along the *ren mai*, the yin vessel, which descends from the throat along the chest and abdomen to the lower body.\n\nThe upper twenty hexagrams model heaven. Heaven is the light and pure aspect of yang, hence they are all hexagrams of four or five yang lines. The lower twenty hexagrams model earth. Earth is the heavy and turbid aspect of yin, hence they are all hexagrams of four or five yin lines. The middle twenty hexagrams resemble humans. Humans embody the virtue of heaven and earth and the interaction of yin and yang, hence they are all hexagrams of three yin and three yang lines—just as the human meridians and limbs each have three yin and three yang. Moreover, the upper part of the human body models heaven, the middle part models humans, and the lower part models earth—this is also its meaning. From this, it is clear that the meaning of the *Cantong Qi* is not unfounded.\n\nAs for *Heng* residing in the center, it corresponds to the *Book of Documents*’ \"if one has a constant nature,\" the *Commentary*’s \"constancy in unifying virtue,\" and *Mencius*’ \"constant heart and constancy in it.\" The *Tuan* states: \"The sun and moon attain heaven and thus can shine long; the four seasons transform and thus can endure in completion. The sage endures in the Dao, and all under heaven is transformed and completed. Observing what is constant, the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things can be seen.\"\n\n**Diagram Ten: The Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Application**\n\nThe *Shuo Gua* states: \"The Supreme Deity emerges from *Zhen*, aligns in *Xun*, appears in *Li*, labors in *Kun*, delights in speech through *Dui*, contends in *Qian*, toils in *Kan*, and completes speech in *Gen*.\"\n\n**Diagram of the Images of the Sixty-Four Hexagrams’ Application in the Posterior Heaven Arrangement**\n\nThe determination of hexagram positions has long been doubted by Master Zhu, who deemed it proper to leave it unresolved rather than force an explanation. Later scholars, however, have attempted to justify it through the interchange of lines and the sequence of the five phases, merely imposing their interpretations on the existing positions without any solid basis.\n\nNow, examining the transformations of the *Hetu*’s images and numbers, and further deriving the Prior Heaven hexagram positions along with those found in common divination texts, another diagram is presented, accompanied by this explanation: *Qian* arises in the northwest, reflecting the principle that \"heaven inclines toward the northwest.\"\n\n*(Text missing: approximately thirty characters.)*\n\nSince *Qian* is positioned in the northwest, *Kun* should occupy the southeast. However, as \"earth is incomplete in the southeast,\" *Xun*, the eldest daughter, takes its place—*Xun* being the inversion of *Dui* in the Prior Heaven arrangement.",

Its three lines all transform into *Xun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Dui*. Water pools into marsh, thus *Dui* occupies the due west, the Prior Heaven position of *Kan*; *Kan* water moistens downward, thus its bottom line transforms into *Dui*. Its three lines all transform into *Gen*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Zhen*, so that *Zhen* and *Dui* are horizontally opposed, their positions aligned laterally.\n\nMaster Shao said: \"*Zhen* and *Dui* are lateral, while the six hexagrams are vertical—such is the application of the *Yi*.\" How profound these words! Precisely because of this, the palace hexagrams transmitted in contemporary divination also oppose one another: *Qian* and *Kun* are opposed, *Kan* and *Li* are opposed, *Zhen* and *Dui* are opposed, *Gen* and *Xun* are opposed. The *Gou* of the *Qian* palace derives from *Kun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Guai*; *Qian*’s *Dun* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Dazhuang*; *Qian*’s *Pi* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Tai*; *Qian*’s *Guan* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Lin*; *Qian*’s *Bo* is the reverse of *Kun*’s *Fu*. The *Jie* of the *Kan* palace derives from *Li*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Huan*; *Kan*’s *Zhun* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Meng*; *Kan*’s *Jiji* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Weiji*; *Kan*’s *Ge* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Ding*; *Kan*’s *Feng* is the reverse of *Li*’s *Lü*. The *Bi* of the *Gen* palace derives from *Xun*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Shihe*; *Gen*’s *Daxu* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Wuwang*; *Gen*’s *Sun* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Yi*; *Gen*’s *Kui* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Jiaren*; *Gen*’s *Lü* is the reverse of *Xun*’s *Xiaoxu*. The *Yu* of the *Zhen* palace derives from *Dui*, yet when viewed in reverse, it becomes *Qian*; *Zhen*’s *Xie* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Jian*; *Zhen*’s *Heng* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Xian*; *Zhen*’s *Sheng* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Cui*; *Zhen*’s *Jing* is the reverse of *Dui*’s *Kun*.\n\nThe two hexagrams of *Youhun* and *Guihun* are said to lie outside the regular transformations of the eight palaces. When the fifth line of the original palace hexagram transforms, yielding an outer-body hexagram, and the inner three lines all transform, it becomes *Youhun*. It is called *You* (\"wandering\") because it moves from inner to outer. When the fifth line transforms while the inner three lines remain unchanged, it becomes *Guihun*. It is called *Gui* (\"returning\") because it moves from outer back to inner. Revolving left and right, ascending and descending, the ritual and law of the king are fully encompassed herein.\n\nThe *Commentary on the Yarrow Stalks* states: \"The number of the great expansion is fifty; its use is forty-nine.\" Master Zhu said: \"The number of the great expansion is derived from the central five of the *Hetu* multiplied by the ten of earth. Multiplying five by ten or ten by five both yield fifty. Yet when used for divination, only forty-nine are employed—all arises from the natural principle and configuration, not something human intellect or effort can alter.\"\n\nThe forty-nine yarrow stalks on the right are bound into a single bundle, modeling the image of the undivided Great Ultimate. The reason for this number lies in the sum of the lines generating the eight hexagrams. For the yang instrument: one line for the instrument, two for the image, four for the hexagram—seven in total. For the yin instrument: one line for the instrument, two for the image, four for the hexagram—seven in total. Multiplying by seven yields forty-nine.\n\nThe *Commentary* states: \"The virtue of the yarrow stalks is round and spirit-like.\" Roundness arises from their odd number; when seven are gathered and clustered, natural roundness emerges. \"The virtue of the hexagrams is square and knowing.\" Squareness arises from their even number; when eight directions are juxtaposed and layered, natural squareness emerges. \"Spirit\" denotes wondrous, unfathomable function; \"knowing\" denotes transformation without constraint. The yarrow stalks are yang, the hexagrams yin; the yarrow stalks move, the hexagrams are still—such is the ultimate embodiment and application of the *Great Yi*.\n\nThe right hand separates one. The *Commentary* states: \"Divide into two to model the Two; suspend one to model the Three.\" The Two are heaven and earth; the Three is humanity. \"Suspend\" means to set aside, as the *Yunhui* says: \"to place without use.\" The old explanation of suspending between the little finger and the next finger is untenable, for it would require a second \"binding\" before suspension, and it mistakenly assumes that the second transformation must involve suspension. A single character’s misinterpretation leads to endless confusion.\n\nThe forty-nine yarrow stalks on the right are divided into two to model the Two Modes, with one stalk suspended in the center to model humanity. The forty-eight stalks on the left and right represent the sum of the hexagram lines. The twenty-four primary lines of the eight hexagrams, when doubled, become forty-eight; moreover, each hexagram undergoes eight transformations, and its lines likewise number forty-eight. In the counting method, first take the left-hand stalks in the left hand, then with the right hand suspend one stalk from the right half in the center without further moving it, modeling humanity’s place between heaven and earth. Whether yin or yang, cold or heat, day or night, all transformations are left to heaven, with no human intervention. Though the one stalk does not intervene, it is always used alongside the forty-eight.",

      "translated_text": "This models the Three Powers. Next, with the right hand, count the stalks in the left hand in groups of four and set aside the remainder—whether one, two, three, or four—between the little finger and the next finger, called the *le* (binding), symbolizing the intercalary month added every three years. Then, with the right hand, take the stalks from the right half: if one remains, take three; if three remain, take one; if two remain, take six; if four remain, take four, and bind them between the next finger and the middle finger, called the *second le*, symbolizing the two intercalary months in five years. Only then is the suspended stalk addressed: the two remainders from the bindings are combined and placed with the suspended stalk, following the method of \"suspending one.\" As the *Yunhui* states, \"combine and place them together.\" The number of bound remainders is either four or eight—never five or nine. Four is considered odd, being a single four. Eight is considered even, being two fours. Then, the stalks that have been counted are recombined: either forty-four or forty remain. The division, counting, binding, and suspending proceed as before for the second transformation. The remaining stalks after counting are then recombined: either forty, thirty-six, or thirty-two, and the division, counting, binding, and suspending proceed again for the third transformation. After three transformations, the suspended stalks are examined: three odd remainders indicate *old yang*; three even remainders indicate *old yin*. Two even and one odd, with the odd as primary, indicate *young yang*; two odd and one even, with the even as primary, indicate *young yin*. Each set of three transformations forms one line, and eighteen transformations form one hexagram. One hexagram can transform into sixty-four hexagrams, encompassing the four thousand ninety-six possible hexagrams. As the *Commentary* states: \"Count in fours to model the four seasons; bind the remainders to model intercalary months. Five years contain two intercalary months, hence the second binding before suspending.\"\n\nIn this diagram, when four stalks are counted from the left and one remains, three remain on the right; when three remain on the left, one remains on the right—these are the yang numbers of the bound remainders for the Two Modes. When two remain on the left, six are taken on the right; when four remain on the left, four also remain on the right—these are the yin numbers of the bound remainders for the Two Modes. Master Zhu said: \"The symbol of the odd is round: a circle has a diameter of one and a circumference of three, and yang employs its fullness. Old yang has three odd remainders, three threes making nine, and the counted stalks number thirty-six. The symbol of the even is square: a square has a diameter of one and a circumference of four, and yin employs its half. Old yin has three even remainders, three twos making six, and the counted stalks number twenty-four. Young yang has one odd and two even remainders: one odd is three, two evens are two each, totaling seven (one three and two twos), and the counted stalks number twenty-eight. Young yin has one even and two odd remainders: one even is two, two odds are three each, totaling eight (one two and two threes), and the counted stalks number thirty-two. Such is the natural wonder of the milfoil numbers and hexagram lines.\"\n\nOn the right: each set of three transformations forms one line. If all three transformations yield odd remainders, it resembles *Qian*, and the line is drawn as ⚊, signifying yang transforming into yin. If all three transformations yield even remainders, it resembles *Kun*, and the line is drawn as ⚋, signifying yin transforming into yang. If two odd and one even remainders are obtained, with the even as primary, the position of the even—whether initial, second, or third—resembles *Xun*, *Li*, or *Dui*, and the line is drawn as — without change. If two even and one odd remainders are obtained, with the odd as primary, the position of the odd—whether initial, second, or third—resembles *Zhen*, *Kan*, or *Gen*, and the line is drawn as — without change. These eight forms correspond to the eight trigrams.\n\nThe form ⚊ comprises twenty-four instances. The form ⚋ likewise comprises twenty-four instances. The form — comprises eight instances. The form — comprises eight instances. In total, there are sixty-four instances, as explained in the subsequent diagram.\n\nOn the right: two even and one odd remainders, with the odd as primary, represent the stalks of *young yang* for *Gen*, *Kan*, and *Zhen*, totaling twenty-four. For *Gen*, the odd remainder is obtained in the third transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Kan*, the odd remainder is obtained in the second transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Zhen*, the odd remainder is obtained in the initial transformation, yielding eight stalks. The bound remainders total five, and five fives make seven when counted, with seven fours representing yang in its correct and unchanging state.\n\nOn the right: two odd and one even remainders, with the even as primary, represent the stalks of *young yin* for *Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*, totaling twenty-four. For *Xun*, the even remainder is obtained in the initial transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Li*, the even remainder is obtained in the second transformation, yielding eight stalks. For *Dui*, the even remainder is obtained in the third transformation, yielding eight stalks. The bound remainders total sixteen, and the counted stalks total thirty-two; divided by four, the bound remainders total four, and four fours make eight when counted, representing yin in its correct and unchanging state.\n\nOn the right: three odd remainders indicate *old yang*, representing the stalks of *Qian*, totaling eight. The bound remainders total twelve, and the counted stalks total thirty-six; divided by four, the bound remainders total three, and three fours make nine when counted—nine nines of four nines represent yang at its extreme, transforming into yin. The *Book of Changes* uses transformation for divination, and all changing yang lines are collectively called \"nine.\"\n\nOn the right: three even remainders indicate *old yin*, representing the stalks of *Kun*, totaling eight. The bound remainders total twenty-four, and the counted stalks likewise total twenty-four; divided by four, the bound remainders total six, and six fours make six when counted—six sixes of four sixes represent yin at its extreme, transforming into yang.

      "translated_text": "The method of stalk division follows Master Cheng. Master Zhang Zi said: \"In the second and third changes, one does not suspend a stalk.\" This is because in the first change, one stalk is suspended to symbolize the human, set aside and unused; the subsequent two changes then proceed without further suspension, which is correct. The left is divided but not the right, following the methods of Tang scholars Zhang Yuan and Zhuang Cho. As heaven moves and earth is still, yang transforms and yin unites, and earth follows heaven in its course—this accords with principle. When the left leaves a remainder of one and the right complements it with three, or leaves three and complements it with one, this completes the oddness of yang. When the left leaves a remainder of two and the right complements it with six, or leaves four and complements it with four, this completes the evenness of yin. Yin and yang, greater and lesser, are balanced and upright. If, as in recent times, all three changes involve suspension and both left and right are divided, then old yang numbers twelve, lesser yin twenty-eight, lesser yang twenty, and old yin four—uneven and disproportionate. If the first change involves suspension while the latter two do not, yet both left and right are still divided, then greater yang numbers twenty-seven, lesser yin twenty-seven, lesser yang nine, and greater yin one. Though all sum to sixty-four, the body of greater yin is exceedingly rare. There may be those who divide stalks all year without ever encountering the transformation of pure *Kun* into *Qian*. Those who understand transformation should diligently study these subtleties.\n\nExamining the changes for divination: the stalks of *Qian* number two hundred sixteen, and those of *Kun* one hundred forty-four, together totaling three hundred sixty, corresponding to the days of a year. The stalks of the two *Books* number eleven thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the number of all things. Thus, four operations complete the *Changes*, eighteen changes complete a hexagram, and eight trigrams form a lesser completion. Extending and expanding this, following categories to their fullest, the abilities of all under heaven are exhausted.\n\nThe stalks of *Qian* are calculated by multiplying the number of old yang, thirty-six, by the six lines of a hexagram, yielding two hundred sixteen. The stalks of *Kun* are calculated by multiplying the number of old yin, twenty-four, by the six lines of a hexagram, yielding one hundred forty-four. Together, they total three hundred sixty. \"Corresponding to the days of a year\" refers to the Zhou calendar, where eleven months form a year. Counting by new moons, there are three hundred fifty-four days; counting by solar terms, there are three hundred sixty-five and a quarter days. Taking the median between the excess of solar terms and the deficiency of new moons, it is said to be three hundred sixty. However, the stalks of lesser yang number twenty-eight; multiplied by the six lines of *Qian*, they total one hundred sixty-eight. The stalks of lesser yin number thirty-two; multiplied by the six lines of *Kun*, they total one hundred ninety-two. Together, they also total three hundred sixty. The *Great Commentary* does not mention this because the *Changes* employs nine and six, not seven and eight.\n\nThe two *Books* refer to the sixty-four hexagrams of the upper and lower canons. There are one hundred ninety-two yang lines; multiplying by old yang’s thirty-six yields six thousand nine hundred twelve. There are one hundred ninety-two yin lines; multiplying by old yin’s twenty-four yields four thousand six hundred eight. Together, they total eleven thousand five hundred twenty, corresponding to the number of all things. However, multiplying lesser yang’s twenty-eight by one hundred ninety-two yang lines yields five thousand three hundred seventy-six. Multiplying lesser yin’s thirty-two by one hundred ninety-two yin lines yields six thousand one hundred forty-four. Together, they also total eleven thousand five hundred twenty. Thus, the numbers of lesser yin and lesser yang are concealed within those of old yin and old yang. Seven and nine are both yang and odd, while six and eight are both yin and even—this is the meaning of *Qian*’s nine and *Kun*’s six.\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram employs nine: \"Seeing a hidden dragon without a head is auspicious.\" The *Kun* hexagram employs six: \"Beneficial for eternal steadfastness.\" The above clarifies the general rules for divination using the nine and six changes of the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\nMaster Zhu said: \"When none of the six lines of a hexagram change, one divines using the hexagram’s image and judgment, taking the inner trigram as the primary (*zhen*) and the outer trigram as the regret (*hui*).\" According to the *Zuozhuan*: Kong Chengzi divined the establishment of Wei’s Prince Yuan and encountered *Tun* (☳ below ☵ above), saying, \"Beneficial to establish a lord.\" The Duke of Qin divined his attack on Jin and encountered *Gu* (☴ below ☶ above), saying, \"*Gu*’s primary is wind; its regret is mountain.\" These are examples of divining with the hexagram’s image and judgment when none of its six lines change.\n\nWhen one line changes, one divines using the changing line’s judgment from the original hexagram. Bi Wan of Jin encountered *Tun* (☳ below ☵ above) transforming into *Bi* (☷ below ☵ above)—the first line, nine. Cai Mo encountered *Qian* (☰ below ☰ above) transforming into *Tongren* (☲ below ☰ above)—the second line, nine. Duke Wen of Jin encountered *Dayou* (☰ below ☲ above) transforming into *Kui* (☱ below ☲ above)—the third line, nine. Chen Jingzhong encountered *Guan* (☷ below ☴ above) transforming into *Pi* (☷ below ☰ above)—the fourth line, six. Nan Kuo encountered *Kun* (☷ above ☷ below) transforming into *Bi* (☷ below ☵ above)—the fifth line, six. Duke Xian of Jin encountered *Guimei* (☱ below ☳ above) transforming into *Kui* (☱ below ☲ above)—the top line, six. These are examples of divining with the changing line’s judgment when one line changes.\n\nWhen two lines change, one divines using the judgments of the two changing lines from the original hexagram, still taking the upper line as primary—though the *Commentary* provides no examples. When three lines change, one divines using the image and judgment of both the original and resultant hexagrams, taking the original hexagram as primary (*zhen*) and the resultant hexagram as regret (*hui*). Prince Chong’er divined his attainment of the state and encountered *Zhen* (☳ below ☵ above) as primary and *Yu* (☷ below ☳ above) as regret—all lines were eight, for the first and fifth lines were nine, and the fourth line was six, totaling three changing lines.",
      "overlap_context": "ng eight. The bound remainders total twenty-four, and the counted stalks likewise total twenty-four; divided by four, the bound remainders total six, and six fours make six when counted—six sixes of four sixes represent yin at its extreme, transforming into yang. The *Book of Changes* uses transformation for divination, and all changing yin lines are collectively called \"six.\"\n\nOn the right: the eight forms of the trigrams each comprise eight instances, together forming the sixty-four hexagrams.",

      "translated_text": "When two, three, or the top line are all eight in both hexagrams, as in the case divined by Minister Ji of Sikong, who declared: \"All are favorable for establishing feudal lords.\" This is the example of three changing lines. Moreover, in the first ten hexagrams, the original hexagram governs the *zhen* (primary), while in the latter ten, the resultant hexagram governs the *hui* (regret), as shown in the *Sixty-Four Hexagrams Transformation Diagram* in the *Qimeng*. When four lines change, one divines using the two unchanging lines of the resultant hexagram, still taking the lower line as primary—though the *Commentary* provides no examples. When five lines change, one divines using the unchanging line of the resultant hexagram.\n\nMu Jiang, on her way to the eastern palace, encountered *Gen* (☶ below ☶ above) with eight. The scribe said: \"This is called *Gen* transforming into *Sui* (☳ below ☱ above).\" For the first, fourth, and fifth lines were six, and the third and top lines were nine—all five lines changed. Only the second line was eight, remaining unchanging. By rule, one should use the judgment of *Sui*’s second line—*\"Tied to a youth, losing a man\"*—for the divination, yet the scribe wrongly cited *Sui*’s image statement in response; this was incorrect.\n\nWhen all six lines change, only in the cases of *Qian* and *Kun* are the judgments of both hexagrams used; for other hexagrams, one uses the image statement of the resultant hexagram. Cai Mo said: \"*Qian* transforming into *Kun* is called *'Seeing a flock of dragons without a head—auspicious.'*\" This is its example. Thus, one hexagram may transform into sixty-four hexagrams, and the forty thousand ninety-six hexagrams are contained therein.",
