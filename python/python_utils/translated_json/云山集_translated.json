The laughter shared at Tiger Creek,\nThe solitary sigh of Nan-guo gazing at the sky.\nShu’s nine years of study perfected the great mystery;\nA single night’s affirmation left no residue.\n\nFor vast or minute, coarse or fine, every phenomenon embodies the Dao;\nFrom soaring birds to hidden fish, each form is true suchness.\nGongsun’s sophistry debates the \"not-horse\";\nHui Shi’s many devices question the joy of fish.\n\nHark! Scraping the wild elder’s eyes,\nSevering the mountain boy’s finger.\nCan one’s response be anything but a single \"yes\"?\nYan Hui sat in forgetfulness and attained mastery.\n\nDeluded, the Jingwei bird carries earth to fill the sea;\nEnlightened, the formless one seeks the pearl in the Red River.\nA single misstep in action strays by a mile;\nA word spoken misses by a thousand.\n\nYet to act with abandon is unobstructed;\nThe brush’s fall sweeps away all dust and grime.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on the Heart-Mind**\nIts nature arises from the Dao, its emotions are born of the heart-mind.\nGathering the roots of the senses, it governs the throat of good and evil.\nThoughts flow ceaselessly, the past does not halt, the present does not cease;\nEver renewing, it surfaces in motion and sinks in stillness.\n\nWhen it is neither being nor non-being, it is perception and cognition.\nEmerging, it clings to affairs and attaches to things;\nMoving, it chases sounds and pursues forms.\nIt cannot be abandoned, nor can it be grasped.\n\nIt commands the legions of demonic grasses, enduring through kalpas;\nSeated as the chief of the three karmas, it is never mastered.\nYet when worldly cares are stilled, the spirit abides in clarity.\nLight blazes from cold ashes, auspiciousness arises in an empty chamber.\n\nVast beyond all bounds, it conceals the subtlest traces.\nShedding all entanglements, it arrives at unknowing yet feels near;\nIn steadfast embrace, it adapts to every use with ease.\n\nEven in lighting incense, brewing tea, or sweeping the floor,\nWhatever is casually grasped responds in kind;\nWhatever is set down aligns perfectly.\nThe Yangtze, the Yellow, the Huai, and the seas—though their currents differ, their waters are one;\nHairpins, bracelets, broken plates—though their uses vary, their gold is the same.\n\nAdapting to circumstances, it shifts its form;\nFollowing conditions, it generates hues.\nIn stillness, it congeals like earth; in motion, it hangs like heaven.\nWhen needed by the feet, it moves in crossed legs or paces;\nWhen needed by the hands, it clenches into fists.\n\nIn action or rest, lifting or plucking, it presides as the formless master;\nIn seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving, it occupies the moment before engagement.\n\nYet to transcend the ten stages and three vehicles,\nTo encompass the five phases and four images—\nStanding centered without leaning, preserving inner harmony without wavering—\nA moment’s pride in superior insight may plunge one into today’s itch for scratching.\n\nWhere lies the essence of the Wei and Si traditions? In entering the hall and ascending the room.\nWhat is the wonder of Zhuangzi’s garden? In pushing open the gate and laying down the staff.\n\nHow grand! A single aperture opens, eight faces gleam.\nThe pearl glows atop the void, the cinnabar circles within the jeweled tripod.\nMerging heaven and earth into one body, it seizes creation to share its work.\n\nWithout image or self, it nurtures all like spring’s warmth;\nUnobstructed and unclinging, it traverses the sky like the autumn moon.\n\nAh! Those who follow affairs and find peace return home by the road;\nThose who use things as they are attain wonder in the flow.\nThe great measure of rivers and seas—what does it not contain?\nThe high-hung sun and moon—what place do they not illuminate?\n\nThe realm of self and things is one, being and non-being share the same essence.\nThis is the pivot of the five constants and hundred deeds, the essential summary of all sages and perfected beings.\n\n*Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One – Seven-Character Ancient Verse (Long Poem)*\n\n**Awakening to Emptiness**\nIn this vast kalpa, why such delusion? Like lotus roots coiled in green mud, we prolong our entanglement.\nWho knows if the Creator merely plays with us, shifting valleys and boats east and west in the dead of night?\nThe heart is assailed by profit and desire, a spectacle more frenzied than the Yellow Gate’s turmoil;\nDazzled by empty flowers, we mistake them for reality.\nThe wind’s blade and kalpa-fire descend from heaven, fanning flames that scorch Kunlun’s jade and stone.\nWorldly dust is swept away, all reduced to emptiness—until great pardon opens the cage.\nOnly then do we realize the yellow millet remains uncooked, suddenly startled by the wind at the tower’s eaves.\nOpening our eyes, we recognize the nightmare’s horror; reflecting deeply, we see past affairs were all mistaken.\nHeaven grants me good causes, leaping from the dust to attain true joy.\nIf asked how to reach emptiness without reliance, how could it compare to turning the wheel of the Profound Mystery?\nThe work complete, I shed this mortal garb, riding the wind back to the Five Clouds’ palace halls.\n\n**Verifying Illusions**\nThe Daoist plays in the true samādhi, transforming with divine powers swift as a fox.\nSilent as the abyss, yet thunder shakes the nine heavens; dwelling in stillness, yet sunlight illumines the dusty world.\nThe golden rooster crows—clay oxen flee; withered trees roar like dragons, stubborn stones howl.\nJade maidens play flutes, phoenixes sing; wooden men dance in rhythm, sinews twisting.\nThe subtlest movements trigger heaven’s gate-mechanism, clapping the void without end.\nNeither being nor non-being, beyond measure—who can fathom it?\nNow reversing, now flowing—who can know?\nThe great wonder demands nine years of cultivation; the seven sages lose their way on the path.\nPushing the staff and setting it down—when will they meet? Winking and blinking, they merely peer in vain.\n\n**Verifying Dreams**\nOf old, I heard of King Mu’s journey to the Dark Palace, where azure towers and crimson gates stood amid clouds.\nYet shifting to higher realms brought terror, and the heavenly wind blew him back to his cage.\nI also heard of the Yellow Emperor’s land of Huaxu, where he walked the void as if treading solid ground.\nClouds and mist dissolved, mountains and valleys leveled—yet it still resembled emerging from a mural’s forest.\nSpirit-wandering in dreams never leaves one’s place; riding the wind to the moon is not the constant way.\nA single leap straight to Kunlun’s summit—who inherits the original, inherent truth?\nThe dusty world drifts in dream’s upheaval, truth and illusion vie like deer in a dispute.\nThe locust’s branches and ant’s battles rage—what are they but clamoring oysters and warring snails?\nAwake or dreaming, both arise from primordial chaos; now, in waking or sleeping, I remain of the same lineage.\nI ask the master: have you opened your eyes yet? A gust of wind carries\n\nIn the year’s cold, the sunken cavern conceals Fenglong’s might,\nPent and coiled, it lingers, bearing the surging Dao within.\nSeizing the moment, moving with the season—no delay,\nFrom spring’s beginning to summer’s end, amid yellow dust it lies.\n\nTo stretch yet not stretch, transforming into things,\nIts twisted roots and gnarled knots delay Heaven’s work.\nWilderness and chaos offer no reliance,\nYet it stands tall, emerging at the Western Fork Palace.\n\nSprouting forth, shedding its sheath—pure and strong,\nBranches spread, leaves unfurl, displaying its might.\nThe master, seeking the Dao, longs to enter the chamber,\nLeaning at the gate, he becomes a green-robed youth.\n\nBefore Xiangyan’s fragrance could convey the message,\nThe wondrous transmission came from Master Suspended Gourd.\nWith an empty heart, it inwardly gathers the earth’s veins,\nIn an instant, ten thousand miles are traversed as if riding the wind.\n\nGuarding the dragon’s offspring without the slightest loss,\nIts jade sprouts remain untainted by the finest dust.\nOne day, when merit is complete, this power will serve,\nFreely roaming the six directions, wandering without end.\n\nFeng Quan teaches Qing to celebrate birth with Mount Du as blessing.\n\nBefore the primordial chaos divided, it embraced heaven and earth,\nAll things, great and small, were firmly preserved.\nThe Primordial Beginning, the August Jade Sovereign, established the central pole,\nThe Heavenly Pillar stands tall—its name is Kunlun.\n\nAbove, no canopy—only the eyes of heaven,\nBelow, no base—it upholds the earth’s axis.\nPalaces coil atop the mountain’s peak,\nThe turning jade mechanism lies within its belly.\n\nTowering crags, jade peaks rise in drought,\nSoaring beyond form, unmatched in majesty.\nGreat Miaogu and Taihua,\nBelow, mere mounds—Jo and Song seem slight.\n\nDivine beings, their skin gleaming like ice and snow,\nHearts like deep springs, in harmony with sun and moon.\nThough kalpas and seas shift and change,\nThey remain ageless, neither old nor young.\n\nI only wish the old immortal were like this mountain,\nForever youthful, his crimson face never fading.\nYet the foolish masses trample beneath,\nAll awakened from deafness and blindness, passing through the mysterious gate.\n\n*Out-of-season peach blossoms*\n\nThe principles of things—flourishing and withering—follow their own time,\nDeviating from the season, defying custom, the heart doubts itself.\nThis peach blooms untimely, surely not in season,\nIts hidden fruit, none know.\n\nFrost withers the hundred grasses, all perish,\nYet it stands alone, displaying heaven’s natural grace.\nThe Daoist cherishes this form unlike the common,\nBreaking off a branch to show its marvel.\n\nAlas, this kind has no gnarled roots,\nTransplanted to the Cave of Eternal Spring,\nIt blooms and bears fruit for three thousand years,\nA rare taste in Jambudvīpa, few attain.\n\n*Sent to Lu Caiqing*\n\nFate toys with man as if tossing a ball,\nPointlessly bewitching, cunningly deceiving.\nI recall the second and third months of Guiwei,\nThe old garden shaken by the cold of halberds and spears.\n\nExhausted, gasping, each fled in panic,\nA thousand miles of hardship—travel was perilous.\nThis life, this body, borrowed and borrowed again,\nYet under your jade shelter, all was peaceful.\n\nWhen would the sixth month’s summer rains come,\nStartling news of Jin’s collapse, the villain overthrown?\nHao’s son slipped on the path, devoured by jackals,\nThe Wen family’s elegance, like clouds and water, at ease.\n\nOf late, carriages depart morning and night,\nSurely you anticipate returning home in brocade robes.\nThe heart’s longing pierces the southwest road,\nThe journey’s hues faintly trace the rising and falling hills.\n\nThis rustic, afflicted by confusion’s malady,\nDares not cling to the steed’s tail—how could he ascend?\n\n*Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One—Five-Character Ancient Verse, Long Composition*\n\n**Exhortation to the World**\n\nLife spans but a hundred years,\nSwift as a finger-snap.\nAll are playthings of Creation’s hand,\nRestless, compelled by fate.\nHurried from dawn to dusk,\nAnxious with joy and sorrow.\nMatters of self dissolve to naught—\nHow much more those beyond?\nEndless affairs of others,\nFortune and misfortune shown to you.\nEvil thoughts pile like mountains,\nWhile the good heart lacks even a speck.\nWhen Old Yama arrives,\nIn an instant, none can stay.\nI urge you, cease your folly,\nSeek refuge in the Way.\nLeap from the pit of karmic fire,\nAbandon old paths trod.\nTurn the mysterious pass,\nAnd long life begins here.\n\n**To Daoist Friend Lun Boyu**\n\nOnce beneath Purple Peak,\nClouds and mist unfolded side by side.\nFrom the perilous pavilion, soft words flowed,\nMorning and night, weariness forgot.\nThe west wind cleared the dust from my robe,\nStaff and sandals followed in your wake.\nParting at Zhenyang, how desolate,\nEyes lingered as your steps slowed.\nAt the crossroads, we pledged Mount Crane,\nYet the current bore you—who could know?\nLike a ram’s horn twisting,\nEach move entangled in sorrow’s thread.\nThe southwest, a den of clouds and waters,\nSet my heart’s banner adrift.\nFortune and misfortune are heaven’s decree,\nMovement and stillness not of man’s design.\nYour intent straight as a plumb line,\nMy heart round as a compass.\nA thousand miles share the bright moon,\nNot a hair’s breadth between.\nSpirits fly to and fro,\nVague, without fixed time.\nRoaming the earth as one,\nHow could we bear even a moment’s parting?\nTreading the void, embracing emptiness,\nWhy doubt this floating flight?\nFrom this, the Three Perfected meet,\nEver in the presence of the sacred.\n\n**Dwelling in the Monastery**\n\nMen dwell, not the monastery—\nWhy debate success or failure?\nThe monastery dwells, not men—\nNo different from worldly bonds.\nFriends, clouds, and soaring halls,\nRegarded as grass and dust.\nExhausting sweat and blood,\nYet all ends in ruin.\nHow much better the true person,\nReciting word by word.\nMorning and night drinking jade dew,\nSilently attaining divine understanding.\nFloating beyond the six realms,\nSwiftly transcending the three worlds.\nOnce the moon-pearl of enlightenment dawns,\nWho would sell it in the mortal market?\nI come to dwell briefly,\nUnconcerned with spaciousness or confinement.\nI seek only cloud-and-mist friends,\nAs if repaying debts from past lives.\nAt peace amid the clamor,\nFame and profit cannot buy steadfastness.\nHeaven endows me with a cold, stern nature,\nYet I sit and let the vulgar stare.\nRising, I lament—\n\n**Solitude’s Difficulty**\n\nHow hard to be truly alone!\nHaughty disdain—how strange.\nSuffering this profound mystery’s malady,\nWho can cure its marrow-deep affliction?\nUnwilling to bind myself,\nHow could I offer fine cuts?\nA propitious wind stirs my spirit,\nStaff and sandals light and swift.\nNorth and south, east and west,\nI wander, learning to stride.\n\n**Secluded Dwelling**\n\nSeclusion delights the rustic heart,\nWorldly affairs left unattended.\nFriends drift apart and reunite,\nServants and children follow your lead.\nNeighbors like enemies,\nYears pass without a word.\nWorldly manners colder than ice,\nHuman feelings as bland as water.\nPatched quail-robe in close view,\nCoarse food, its savor forgot.\nUnfettered in all things,\nContentment alone suffices.\n\n**The Illusion of Form**\n\nThis body brings great suffering,\nForget the self—what cause for sorrow?\nThe form is most intimate,\nYet in the end, it becomes a mound of earth.\nHow much more the things beyond this body,\nAll illusory as the Tower of Nothingness.\nThe great earth labors to give life,\nYet all is fleeting, unfree.\nAll things are predestined,\nWho can seek beyond?\nThe web of doubt shatters itself—\nRest, rest, and rest again.\nDo not be a tool of emptiness,\nNor a prisoner of the real.\nWith a heart vast and at ease,\nRoam in harmony with transformation.\nIn life, do nothing,\nLet it be—do not cling.\nBreak free from the dusty chamber,\nWithin and without, untangled.\nOne day, the ancient moon of nature shines,\nRadiant as autumn’s clear sky.\n\n**Worldly Deceit**\n\nShutting the door, too lazy to go out,\nThe crowd’s judgment loses harmony.\nLeaning on a staff, I walk the streets,\nMy sharp eyes despise the drifting throng.\nThe whole town blames my errors,\nCutting ties, they scorn my deceit.\nHow hard it is to be human—\nEvery move invites slander.\nExamining myself, my heart is not yet ash,\nYet I feign madness as if truly deluded.\nWith a heart of ash, forgetting form,\nWho fears demons and obstacles?\nIn this bustling world,\nNothing lacks a fixed appearance.\nEach clings to their own bias,\nVoices aligning with their kind.\nThe earth is all red dust,\nFrom association, waves turn white.\nTasting the profound mystery’s flavor,\nSudden enlightenment reveals the true state.\nThe solitary moon of self-nature is round,\nThe heart’s expanse like the sky.\nLeaping beyond the gate of life and death,\nPiercing the treasury of light.\n\n**Leaving the Monastery**\n\nAt first, I vowed to guard my folly,\nMuddled, without clarity.\nLong stillness gave way to restlessness,\nMany mouths boasted and marveled.\nRotten meat draws flies,\nMerchandise seeks its price.\nAgain and again, I met with frustration,\nNo time to dance or rest.\nUnable to be without you,\nYet who among you is not false?\nThe hidden bird returns to its cage,\nThe white colt is harnessed.\nYu’s steps and cloud gatherings,\nAll are transformed by transformation.\nThe world delights in shock,\nHearing rumors, they clamor.\nPure admonition aids the real,\nWhy wish for others’ astonishment?\nThe wren soars in empty space,\nHow would the crow know fear?\nA thousand dusts met with a smile,\nCasually, I find respite.\nThe luminous truth above,\nEach pursues their own—none rely on others.\nEntering the realm of nothingness,\nEnjoyment sweet as inverted sugarcane.\nIn the end, what is it like?\nThe world hides within the world.\n\n**Dharma Body**\n\nThe wondrous Dharma Body of the profound mystery,\nAll things and self are fully endowed.\nA speck of dust contains worlds,\nIts vast measure embraces heaven and earth.\nGreat and small, myriad differences,\nYet their root is one and the same.\nLike the vast ocean,\nAll creatures share its bounty.\nAlas, those bound by emotion,\nAgain ensnared by form.\nSunk in the pit of birth and death,\nRevolving like fur and skin.\nDescending to the root, lost in kalpas,\nSuffering as if inverted.\nSages offer expedient means,\nRescuing without abandonment.\nYet how can the wise remain blind,\nFacing each other as in a dream?\nThe pot of heaven—\n\n**The Pot of Heaven**\n\nThe pot of heaven touches the human realm,\nFlawless, purely clear and cold.\nPalaces and pavilions lean on empty azure,\nTheir grandeur linked to the blue mountains.\nThe balmy wind comes from the south,\nInstantly banishing the Fire God’s heat.\nMaster Zhuang and Hui Shi,\nWielding dust whisks, discoursed on frost.\nAscending the Ripple-Viewing Tower,\nGazing down at the long, flowing stream.\n\n**Wild Cranes**\n\nWild cranes each follow their own way,\nTall willows sway in the bright sunlight.\nThe host’s heart holds fine intent,\nYet he pours no \"gosling-yellow\" wine.\nInstead, he brews a draught surpassing jade dust,\nStirring my withered thoughts to life.\nGreen cares dissolve the minutest threads,\nStraightway reaching the land of Nothing-Whatsoever.\nSupreme joy resembles the Fourfold Well—\nWho can measure its bounty?\nWho asks the Master of the Flowering Girdle,\nSoft red dust and fragrant earth?\n\n---\n\n**Postscript to Dong Jiefu’s *Dream of the Yellow Root* Handscroll**\n\nDay is but an open-eyed dream,\nNight a dream within a dream.\nEyes open or lids closed—all is murk,\nAs rise and fall, decay and flourish play their idle games.\nBe it butterfly or Zhou, none knows itself;\nFor whom do brows knit and eyes lift?\nThat *ruyi* found in Deng’s mansion,\nOr world-conquering fame—all but millet cooked in an instant.\nThe world’s time flies so swiftly,\nAs the weaving crow darts through dawn and dusk.\nThough one knows all things are utterly empty,\nHow few grasp the Great Transformation’s haste!\nYet this old man alone has fathomed the profound mystery,\nSeeing clearly that waking and dream are not two.\nUnwilling to vie for deer with lawsuits upon the crown,\nHe long since returned to the cloud-girt palace.\n\n---\n\n**In Memory of the True Man of No Desire**\n\nAn old immortal from Longyou,\nHis lifespan stretched before heaven’s birth.\nWith compassion, he gazed upon the mortal realm,\nWitnessing the dusty world with open eyes.\nEighty-six years passed\nSwift as the flick of a finger.\nYearning once more for the White Cloud Land,\nHe forsook the cinnabar well.\nA form of iridescent clouds emerged,\nThen dissolved like the shadow of a yellow magpie.\nStraight into the vast, solitary sky he entered,\nAnd soon all was still as a mirror.\nThe jewel left no echo,\nAnd none among the onlookers understood.\nIn the empty hall, the night was not yet spent,\nThe moon hung crystalline on the pine’s tip.\n\n---\n\n**Worldly Affairs**\n\nMyriad forms dwell in the vast expanse,\nMoving and resting between high and deep.\nThe mechanism of transformation shifts with use,\nThe principles of things change with the times.\nAn outstretched arm turns present into past,\nA turn of the head—withering or flourishing.\nThe unfeeling reverse their states,\nToying with floating life as if in play.\nThe child of primordial chaos raises the curtain,\nSetting up the puppet stage.\nChildren bicker in their games,\nAnts muster their armies in mock battle.\nA single mass of illusion,\nA hundred kinds of joy and sorrow.\nLife and death turn like a wheel’s hub,\nKalpas pile like mustard seeds filling a city.\nSelf-made prisons without doors,\nWillingly sinking into the pit of karmic fire.\nThe wheel turns without pause,\nSuffering stretches endlessly ahead.\nGreat awakening is like seeking a fleeing hare—\nTurn around and walk the Way.\nSeek not elsewhere,\nFor the mind-ground is already leveled.\n\n---\n\n**To Lu Caiqing**\n\nYou now spur on your steed,\nWhile I lag far behind.\nNext autumn, when the long rains clear,\nThe freezing wind will sweep the cosmos.\nMy travel gear: straw sandals,\nA flowering staff always at hand.\nOnward, heedless of distance,\nDaily needs met as they come.\nWe vowed to share the finest spots of Western Hills—\nBut will my two elder brothers truly agree?\n\n---\n\n**Seeing Off Daoist Fan to the Court in the Spring of Guichou**\n\nThough we met but months ago,\nYour gentle words were still rare.\nNow we part again,\nAs you rein your sleek steed and set forth.\nLate spring in the northern lands,\nWillows sway softly on their own.\nSwiftly you head northwest,\nDark dust swirling behind your horse.\nA mere foot from heaven,\nYour heart must not betray the rain-bringing vow.\nLifting my gaze to the bright moon,\nIts light shines equally on ten thousand homes.\nOld as I am, dwelling among springs and rocks,\nI await your return in brocade robes.\n\n---\n\n**Cloud Mountain Collection, Volume One: Seven-Character Regulated Verse**\n\n**Seven-Character Regulated Verse**\n\n**In Praise of the Dao**\n\n**In Praise of the Dao**\n\nVast and boundless, the divine radiance fills the Great Void,\nIts high and profound governance sets the primal beginning.\nIt embraces the cosmos, nothing lies beyond its reach,\nYet enters the finest hair-tip, its light ever abundant.\nAll phenomena revolve through creation and transformation,\nGrass emerges and vanishes by its breath.\nYet the natures of things permit no exchange of tidings—\nBeast and bird, plant and fish, each abides in its own way.\n\n**Celebrating Long Spring**\nMists unfurl, revealing a thousand mountains and ten thousand leagues of clear sky,\nThe celestial realm brims with spring, its qi overflowing.\nDewdrops glisten in flower hearts, free from worldly cares,\nWillow eyes open to the wind, untouched by mortal passions.\nThe young wander lost in boundless wastes,\nWhile old immortals gather, pledging Penglai and Yingzhou.\nSeated, we drain cups of jade-green wine, joy knows no end—\nDrunk, we ride cloud-chariots homeward, tipped and careening.\n\n**Begging for a Paper Quilt**\nThis form, upright as a hanging wart,\nSees through the original truth—all things come to rest.\nCall it ox or horse, it answers not;\nBid it seek fowl or hound, it knows no desire.\nA single gourd suffices for sustenance, life’s needs are met,\nA hundred patches clothe the body, the year’s provisions complete.\nYet still I beg a paper quilt from the lord’s gate—\nOn cold nights in my snail-shell hut, I sit wrapped to the head.\n\n**Having Long Wished to Make a Paper Quilt, Now at Last It Is Done**\nSoft and fine, layered like tender creek vines,\nSelf-made, its green silk lining fresh as new.\nBy day, it rolls up wild clouds, motionless in flight;\nBy night, it drapes the river moon, its light boundless.\nIts plain simplicity befits its purpose, far from vulgar craft,\nIts warmth, drawn from yang’s harmony, rivals spring’s embrace.\nOld age’s chills demand the aid of fire’s strength—\nOn a low bed by a withered desk, it companions my idle self.\n\n**Awakening from Delusion**\nPure essence once scattered, now thinned and dissipated,\nAdrift and lost, whither does one wander?\nWho governs seeing, hearing, eating, and rest?\nClinging without return, one wearies in vain.\nTo cast a Sui pearl at a sparrow—what folly!\nThe taker scorns it; the seeker prizes it.\nWhen shall one discern that self and ox are not two?\nWhite clouds are trodden, the imperial realm’s return.\n\n**Again**\nHoarding gold and silk invites one’s own blame,\nScattering tiles and pebbles averts no calamity.\nJade refines and polishes, grinding stones to dust;\nPearls emerge from night’s glow, split from the clam’s womb.\nTo hide oneself, one need not shun the deep and remote—\nExternal things are known to come of themselves.\nYet how can one trust this report?\nThe mystery’s gate and spear—how could they open?\n\n**Weary of Abbotship**\nLeaving home, one enters the Daoist’s household,\nExchanging worldly robes for the cold iron of the *khakkhara*.\nHaving awakened to illusion’s hues as no true form,\nHow can one bear, with ailing eyes, to recognize empty flowers?\nLess agile than the leopard of Southern Mountain,\nMore confined than the frog in the well—true poet indeed!\nBetter to lean on a staff for ten idle years,\nWandering waters and clouds, boundless in delight.\n\n**For Guo Ziyuan on His Northward Journey, Written in Tongzhou**\nThis parting marks the first stretch from Yan Mountain,\nThe icy waters of Dichen send you on your way.\nThe Daoist simplifies affairs, yet they multiply;\nFacing guests, he seems heartless, yet feels deeply.\nThe keyhole fits but holds the wedge—\nFrom here, the roc beats the wind, soaring on its journey.\nThe spirit roams the eight limits without end—\nWho knows when we shall meet again in Jade Capital?\n\n**Auspicious Snow**\nThe earth’s every fine detail, all things void,\nThe vast sky stretches endlessly, a single vast expanse.\nNight congeals, cold immerses the plum’s soul and moon;\nDawn brushes lightly, stirring the sash of wind.\nLife and world shift beyond the dust’s bounds,\nHeaven and earth are gathered into the jade pot.\nThe empty hall’s auspicious herbs merge with the jade forest,\nWeighing down Penglai’s foremost peak.\n\n**Sleeping**\nThe mountain of form lies toppled, eyelashes entwined,\nAt the ear’s edge, the world’s clamor rages unheeded.\nLost in profound oblivion, forgetting the master’s reproach,\nHow would it know the disciple’s scorn?\nWhat hinders the dream-fish from swimming the marshlands?\nNo harm in becoming a butterfly, flitting among flower branches.\nThat single spark of wakeful clarity—\nAll realms, all directions, nothing it does not embrace.\n\n**Mid-Autumn**\nThe dusty world cannot resolve its sorrows,\nSo hand in hand, we ascend the southern tower.\nWhat joy does the Daoist find at midnight?\nSitting in clarity, gazing upward, wandering inwardly.\nSuddenly, beyond heaven and earth, all is luminous and pure,\nThe great thousand worlds’ finest details gathered in.\nVast and free, self and things forgotten—\nThe true realm, true joy, endless.\n\n**The Moon Veils Its Light**\nAll sounds hush in autumn’s bold qi,\nWandering clouds thin, the sky stretches high.\nYu’s tower and Yuan’s isle offer no delight—\nLeaning on the oar, pausing the cup, gazing in vain.\nThe moon, round and bright, remains ever thus;\nWhen veiled by mist, its light is fittingly obscured.\nHuman life is but an inn for things—\nJoy and sorrow come and go, inescapable.\n\n**Dream and Awakening**\nNow they speak of last night’s dream,\nLast night’s dreamers now speak.\nSpeakers and dreamers—are they not all I?\nWhy then distinguish between waking and dreaming?\nAs a butterfly or a cicada, things transform—\nAs if pulling a nail or prying a wedge.\nA single thought turns the mechanism—dream and waking empty,\nSpiritual clarity pierces through kalpas of dust and sand.\n\n**A Rare Encounter**\nA meeting once in ten thousand ages, like dawn and dusk,\nA thousand leagues away, the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.\nThe two luminaries flicker past like a galloping colt,\nThe parched earth’s weeds scatter like drifting catkins.\nAwareness and emotion briefly part, like cloud and mud,\nThoughts and cares just divide, entangling self and things.\nThrough the ages, right and wrong are all inverted—\nIn dreams, who has leisure to snatch at their own head?\n\n**Sitting Alone**\nAwakening from dreams—who is Zhou, who the butterfly?\nRiding a crane or girding gold—let none debate.\nEnduring neighbors: pine and stone,\nVast and bright friends: moon and cloud.\nCrows call, wind carries the celestial melody,\nMountain hues and stream lights reveal earth’s patterns.\nThe true realm, serene beyond worldly affairs—\nNo need to seek again the White Prime Lord.\n\n**Losing the Self**\nThe Daoist dwells where there is no dwelling,\nThe great function’s full mechanism meets all encounters.\nWith intent, one observes the face yet fails to meet—\nLosing the self, conduct and speech lose their way.\n*Chu ci* summons the soul, but the soul does not return,\nProfit and fame—best to keep them at a distance.\nThe floating yang, like sesame and millet, swirls—\nChasing the drum’s beat is no true mechanism.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nThe numinous wind stirs the lofty—what constancy?\nReturning the light, every household preserves its radiance.\nBefore the formless cliff, lush auspicious grasses thrive,\nOn the unbudding branch, true fragrance lingers.\nFire-pears and flame-jujubes are no other things,\nMighty phoenixes and benevolent qilins bring their own blessings.\nThe golden key and jade lock open freely—\nWater and clouds, faintly recalling the land of water and clouds.\n\n**The Void’s Substitution**\nAnts and clams know not the snail’s retreat,\nThe locust altar’s emptiness invites frost’s encroachment.\nMountains and rivers show you the emptiness of rise and fall,\nSun and moon, east and west, endure from ancient times.\nGain and loss cease not, turning like a hand’s palm,\nRight and wrong have no fixed form, bound to love and hate.\nWho has eyes as vast as a cartwheel?\nAt a glance, all empty flowers sink into oblivion.\n\n**Deluded Mind**\nIn dreams and illusions, dawn follows dusk,\nIn the arena of fame and profit, right blends with wrong.\nSo much ado—why not return?\nThe axe at the brow, though moved by feeling, fells itself,\nThe adze at the nose, though formless, for whom is it swung?\nWhen will the siege of sorrow be breached?\nTurn the wheel of the Profound Mystery to set the mechanism aright.\n\n**First Appointment at Changchun Abbey**\nNow I’ve outlasted the weeds of Fan and Lai,\nThe pot is broken, the kitchen bare, not even rice remains.\nLeaning on my staff, I grimace at the desolation,\nEntering the gate, I stifle laughter at the fools.\nArranging delicate matters for livelihood,\nPointing to emptiness as the only need.\nNot clinging to a single thread, I sit in idle repose—\nWhere else could I seek the robe and pearl?\n\n**Former Reclusion**\nMy rustic heart recalls only the gleam of the forest,\nStaff and sandals treading the soft green at every turn.\nMy gaze stretches wide, unobstructed by things,\nMy ears are cleansed, hearing only the pure, far from dust.\nBeyond the distant hedge, flowers and trees speak of new grains,\nCoarse rice and salted greens follow the old ways.\nYear after year, day after day, with nothing to do—\nYet better than Peng soaring into the azure void.\n\n**Reception**\nHow can a small vessel hold the turbid and the clear?\nHuman sentiment pushes and pulls, forcing compliance.\nWalking upright, I turn my back on the god of wealth,\nSitting in stillness, I let the starving ghosts take hold.\nHow could I bear to offer sweet wine as a parting gift?\nComing and going, they demand clarity sharper than ice.\nI bid you examine the ever-abiding—\nThe old vine west of the hut remains unharmed.\n\n**Worldly Sentiment**\nCrying crows and fragrant blossoms all belong to spring,\nIn their midst, every form is imbued with the divine.\nLofty and lowly, wriggling and creeping, shift with the times,\nSparrows and eagles, hawks and doves, follow new transformations.\nWorldly ways are all topsy-turvy,\nThe passions of things roll on, sprawling and chaotic.\nDust and haze shroud the morning market—\nAll see gold, none see the man.\n\n**Visiting a Friend**\nA heart of iron and stone in a puppet’s body,\nWith sincerity and discernment, I seek my kindred.\nWielding the adze to remove the whitewash—hard to refine,\nForging the furnace to restore the heavens—not yet true.\nHuman affairs cling to delusion, bewitched by illusions,\nWorldly sentiment toys with spirits like a puppet master.\nIn the wondrous moment of meeting, no words are spoken—\nEven in old age, one must still break the wheel oneself.\n\n**As Before**\nTrying to wield the phoenix knife to emulate the ox-carver,\nWorldly sentiment pushes and pulls against the current.\nThough I know I’ve escaped the snares of the dusty world,\nHow could I willingly become a prisoner of wood and earth?\nThe sword is lost, the boat drifts far,\nThe banner is raised by the sea, but the father is hard to find.\nEvery thought is overturned,\nSee through the green emptiness—all things cease.\n\n**Last Words**\nUnderstanding and explanation boast without restraint,\nHalf a lifetime like a hive of clamoring bees.\nThe demon of letters stirs the heart’s banner into chaos,\nThe itch for skill sharpens the tongue’s root to madness.\nWho grasps the plantain to catch the deer?\nKnowing the stakes are held, yet the sheep is forgotten.\nAlas! What is the use of so much talk?\nShatter the knot of doubt, emulate the sealed bag.\n\n**Sealing the Mouth**\nFortunate to escape the dusty snares and worldly nets,\nYet pitiful to still be ensnared by the demons of sages and worthies.\nSo much still lingers in the heart’s chamber,\nVast and empty, it churns like waves on paper.\nHaving awakened, it is no different from the threefold sorrow,\nOnly then do I know there is yet a realm of nothingness.\nFrom now on, I shall curl my tongue and seal my mouth,\nPreserve qi, perfect spirit, and nurture the Great Harmony.\n\n**Assuming the False**\nA leather sack with two legs roams east and west—\nWho in the void could claim lordship?\nDriving the hundred bones through the nine orifices,\nSix ghosts arise, three worms grow.\nA mass of flesh and bone, illusory from the start,\nTen thousand mechanisms, utterly empty to the core.\nEven if the original true self remains,\nWhen admonished, the ears turn deaf as if struck.\n\n**The Mechanism of Transformation**\nThe mechanism of transformation renews itself moment by moment,\nIn the dream of the ant’s realm and the Jambu world, this body resides.\nRare to meet a friend who transcends life and death,\nWeary of hearing the clamor of those chasing fame and profit.\nIn Huayang, the idle beast returns unmet,\nIn the Qi era, the broken wheel is sent in vain.\nIllusory world, illusory body, illusory delusion—\nOnly the false can be, never the true.\n\n**Inheriting the Light**\nPassing the torch to continue the flame requires rekindling,\nThe elixir furnace’s embers gleam like ice.\nThe sea of awakening welcomes the new moon’s fullness,\nThe sky of nature again hosts auspicious clouds.\nWithin the pot, no idle flowers or grasses are sown,\nBeyond things, there is no old vine.\nThe supreme principle is attained from the true and real—\nDo not let heart and mouth fall out of accord.\n\n**Cultivation**\nWhere is cultivation most intimate?\nIn purity and non-action, attaining the original true.\nThe wondrous principle has been complete since the beginning,\nWhen illusory dust is swept away, the primordial chaos is restored.\nThe numinous root flourishes, manifesting in due time,\nThe great function fully reveals itself, renewed day by day.\nIf you seek attainment on one side,\nIn the end, it is but illusion, unrelated to the self.\n\n**Purifying the Heart**\nThe heart’s field—thorns and brambles cut away, leveled,\nFire-pears and flame-jujubes grow as twin trees.\nThe numinous thing is inherently whole, lacking nothing,\nEmpty flowers fade, clarity emerges of itself.\nLike a pearl, like a mirror—round and still,\nLike jade, like ice—pure and clear.\nDo not say the Profound Mystery cannot be transmitted—\nThe living mechanism appears to man in due time.\n\n**Non-Contention**\n\n**Quelling Demons and Stillness**\n\nDemons of the grass bind their heads, the heart’s warfare ceases,\nA thousand gates and ten thousand doors celebrate Great Peace.\nOn a fine night, clouds disperse and the moon shines white,\nIn this sagely age, seas are calm and rivers run clear.\nA perfect victory—dreaming of the land of Huaxu,\nNo need to debate time’s constraints in the mustard-seed city.\nPure contention is inherently unchanging, indestructible,\nThe precious pearl embraces the radiance of Great Light.\n\n*End of Scroll One of Cloud Mountain Collection*\n*Scroll Two of Cloud Mountain Collection—Seven-Character Regulated Verse*\n*Composed by Zhenren Ji Zhizhen, the Knower of the Constant*\n\n**Contentiousness**\nOn the mountain of self and others, each claims a peak,\nMyriad summits block the path, jagged as fangs.\nDust seals the ancient road, no way back,\nMist locks the numinous source, never reaching home.\nWho would bind the heart like a tethered tiger?\nOnly those who glare like croaking frogs.\nA single hair’s touch sparks the heart’s warfare,\nLeaving corpses strewn like hemp in chaos.\n\n**Following the Current**\nDrifting along the stream, sitting upright on a starry raft,\nAwakening to the numinous source—this is home.\nScriptures and verse-satchels, idle playthings,\nThe medicine furnace and elixir tripod, an old man’s livelihood.\nThe Daoist of Clear Stream invites the bright moon,\nThe Master of White Stone reclines in emerald haze.\nFace to face, the three beneficial friends forget all,\nOne scroll of autumn waters, one cup of tea.\n\n**Dwelling in the Mountains**\nA towering boulder serves as a precious seat,\nSoft moss in abundance replaces green felt.\nCloud cliffs and moonlit grottoes array their secluded wonders,\nWind spirits and mountain deities aid the Dharma feast.\nStream waters and lush forests all expound the Dao,\nWildflowers and flying birds all penetrate the Mystery.\nIn an instant, one reaches the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever,\nNo need for words—all are immortals.\n\n**Vulgar Customs**\nWhose chickens and dogs roam freely, knowing their quest?\nA stubborn heart refuses to be reined in.\nThe ear-moon is enslaved by sound and form,\nThe bodily frame is ever a prisoner of profit and fame.\nLike woodcutters, they fight over a deer’s share,\nToo lazy to follow the butcher’s art of dismembering oxen.\nRight and wrong are inverted without pause,\nThe cycle of birth and death—when will it end?\n\n**Probing the Mystery**\nChewing through the profound mystery, all things are real,\nGolden flowers emerge from water, pure and dustless.\nThe scenery of the celestial pot changes moment to moment,\nThe clouds and rosy mists of grotto-heavens renew every instant.\nKarmic conditions and transformations are but illusory forms,\nThe message of the primordial beginning communicates with the divine.\nThe grasses and trees of the forest make no distinctions—\nOnly the true person among men is genuine.\n\n**Lost at Home**\nWeak and adrift, the path grows ever more errant,\nLike a cicada molting, one never returns home through the ages.\nSandalwood and locust—this fleeting life is like crawling maggots,\nThe battles of the ant clans in Jambudvīpa are like snail wars.\nSound and form cling, thick as honey,\nRight and wrong churn, tangled as hemp.\nWho can rouse the soaring ambition to transcend the heavens,\nLeaping from the sea of delusion onto the moonlit raft?\n\n**Walking Alone**\nBreaking through the profound mystery, gaining freedom to gather and release,\nEvery hair and brow soars through the heavens.\nForgotten beyond the world, seeking neither chickens nor dogs,\nYet obediently answering to the calls of horses and oxen.\nWielding the axe with skill, never striking the nose,\nUnmoved by emotion, even when rice is scattered before him.\nOn a vast night of white moon and clear wind,\nA single leaf of a boat drifts upon rivers and seas.\n\n**Savoring the Real**\nPure contention, non-action—the body of the wondrous mystery,\nA single hair’s rise defiles the heart’s field.\nRaising the brows brings a flurry of affairs,\nOpening the mouth clearly falls into duality.\nThose who sit like blocks of wood are equally burdened,\nHow many are entangled by kudzu vines?\nGathering heads to put on airs—what is the point?\nSeeing through it all, none of it is worth a penny.\n\n**The Dullness of Form**\nFrom the primordial beginning, cast into this prison of form,\nEndlessly toiling, never a moment’s rest.\nPlaying with bones and sinews, displaying strength,\nTossing dust about, hawking from what tower?\nAmid the thicket of right and wrong, ever opening the mouth,\nBefore the mountain of self and others, ever thrusting the head forward.\nOnly when the nose’s breath can no longer be blown,\nWill the skull rest content in the desolate mound.\n\n**Toilsome Life**\nSuperfluous growths and dangling warts—great afflictions of the body,\nFrom the start, mistakenly taken as real.\nPoverty presses urgently, no respite,\nWealth and honor demand ceaseless scheming.\nIn the arena of fame and profit, one adds vigor,\nOn the path of private deceit, one expends spirit.\nIn the end, what does it all become?\nHow bitterly you are toyed with at the crucial moment!\n\n**Heterodox Views**\nBaiting the hook to lure the leviathan—never seen it work,\nYet time and again, they swallow the hook like fledgling birds.\nLike duckweed on water, content to drift,\nLike falling catkins, easily swayed by the wind.\nEyes diseased, they mistake the real for the false,\nMinds deranged, they turn goodness into demons.\nLong-held delusions are hard to reverse,\nEven those who return may aid the overgrown sprouts.\n\n**True Virtue**\nThe moment a thought arises, ghosts and spirits know,\nThe original good heart cannot be deceived.\nAiding beings and benefiting life, forgetting gain and loss,\nYielding to others, acting with humility.\nPrivate deceit and arrogance are routinely dispelled,\nLoyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and compassion rise and descend.\nReverent, sincere, without flattery or crookedness,\nWhere in heaven and earth would one not be fitting?\n\n**Worldly Entanglements**\nEngaging in debates, distinguishing east and west—what merit is there?\nThis heart cannot align with worldly sentiments.\nJade-like nectar speaks of stillness, yet none understand,\nMuddy wine and clamor create their own thickets.\nAdornments attract flies to swarm,\nThe empty boat, loosely moored, drifts on boundless waters.\nOrchids and angelicas remain unruffled, unseen by others,\nYet their pure fragrance still brushes the evening breeze.\n\n**Self-Concealment**\nLetting all matters rest, feigning foolishness,\nUtmost sincerity alone accords with the Dao.\nThe precious pearl of the mystery must be sealed tightly,\nRare herbs and jade flowers bloom late.\nThe elixir is refined, yet none recognize it,\nWhere the talisman flies, even ghosts cannot spy.\nThe Dharma-body merges with the realm of empty space,\nIts wondrous function is clear—no doubt remains.\n\n**Imitative Dharma**\nErecting images to clarify the real only obscures it,\nDim and dull eyes add more dust.\nFrom this, paintings and carvings veil the mystery,\nWhen will clay and wood reveal the Dharma-body?\nIllusions arise from conditions, deceiving the world,\nCunning devices secretly ensnare people.\nTalking of gods and ghosts—errors fill the heavens,\nUnafraid of Yama, the Lord of the Underworld, beware!\n\n**Doctrinal Nets**\nEntering the gate, one wears an iron bridle,\nLed here and there, never free.\nRestrained solely by our teachings and precepts,\nSealed off, not permitted to seek beyond.\nHeaven is but a vain hope, a lure for blessings,\nHell a hollow threat, a tale of woe.\nOver time, one becomes a ghostly exemplar,\nBewitched by demons and delusions until death.\n\n**Chasing the Times**\nThe gates of the powerful are like the sea, I am but a fish,\nBehind each high curtain, I hasten to follow.\nMouths mumble, hearts constrict,\nBodies crane their necks, feet tiptoe.\nEsteeming the Dao and honoring virtue—this is delusion,\nThe net of vulgar customs and worldly dust is the true snare.\nOriginally abandoning home—what was the aim?\nReflecting, all efforts were utterly misguided.\n\n**Vulgar Thoughts**\nThe bitter sea of worldly cares stretches boundless,\nTrivial passions of mortals all topsy-turvy.\nTruth and falsehood blur beyond discernment,\nRight and wrong confound—who can unravel?\nThe whole city hails madness as sagacity,\nThe land sees rectitude as perversity.\nOnce self-interest is prized, who dares defy?\nWhen shall the lotus bloom in fire?\n\n**Distracted Mind**\nPoverty whines while wealth grows wanton,\nRestless feet scurry for more than enough.\nEvery move feigns virtue, every step a lie,\nEach act a ploy, each scheme more cunning.\nNo thought for fairness, kindness, or mercy,\nOnly greed and lust for gain fill the heart.\nEvil accumulates beyond measure—\nSudden calamity strikes without warning.\n\n**Deluded Deeds**\nChiseling away at heaven’s truth, all goes awry,\nDaily, deceit multiplies unnoticed.\nIdle spirits and wayward ghosts vie to deceive,\nWalking corpses and animated bones become demons.\nHarming others to profit oneself, traps are set,\nGrasping at life, coveting things, nets are spread.\nBurdens of sin borne in vain—\nWhen retribution comes, what then?\n\n**Reading Scriptures**\nKnowing scriptures beats ignorance,\nYet even the learned become laughable.\nMouths chew words idly,\nWhen do hearts ever pause to ponder?\nSelf and others, right and wrong only grow,\nGreed and deceit—will they ever be cast aside?\nThe one crucial insight remains obscured,\nWhat use are these *zhi-hu-zhe-ye*?\n\n**Dimming Brilliance**\nNot that brilliance must be shattered into stupidity,\nBut brilliance fears its own confusion.\nElegant phrases and polished words—easily grasped,\nBut pure clarity and perfect brightness—who attains?\nMost flaunt their wit on the tongue,\nFew apply effort to the heart’s ground.\nWhen shall the cosmos settle and heaven’s light dawn?\nOnly then will emptiness and stillness reveal the Dao’s pivot.\n\n**The Mundane**\nAnxious grasping, envy, greed, and self-interest,\nHeedless of peril, all is pursued.\nStrength wanes, influence fades—no proof remains,\nDisaster strikes, misfortune arises—no control.\nInvoking spirits, dancing shamans,\nConsulting talismans, befriending healers.\nIncense burns, a fleeting show of piety,\nYet the whole household follows blindly.\n\n**Intoxicated Heart**\nThe Daoist drinks the elixir’s sweet spring,\nNot the yellow wine that drowns in folly.\nNot the Six Classics’ profound depths,\nBut the Three Essentials’ mystery of mysteries.\nFame’s hook darts—fish swallow the bait,\nProfit lures east and west, craving rank stench.\nDrunk on ten thousand hues, all forgotten—\nOnly the lone moon ascends the jade sky.\n\n**Utter Poverty**\nBrilliance dimmed, the nature’s heaven lies bare,\nEons of dust and passion—all dissected.\nFrom this, the body stands naked, bones exposed,\nNo longer ensnared by illusions’ tangled roots.\nThe cowherd sees not where the man has gone,\nThe ground is utterly empty—even a cone finds no place.\nPoverty pushed to its utmost, poverty ceases—\nThe living impulse released: is it not I?\n\n**Following the True**\nLong have habits bound, greed run rampant,\nThe heart’s turmoil—endless suffering.\nThe true command issues, falsehoods flee,\nA glimmer of real work—Dao may be grasped.\nLifetimes of knowing the thief, yet wandering north,\nKalpas of lost directions, minds pointing south.\nLife after life, chewing bitter coptis,\nYet the first taste of milk-sugar brings sweetness.\n\n**True Practice**\nBegin with humility, ever more humble,\nA level heart, one’s duty—naturally pure.\nAiding others, meeting all with kindness, no lapse,\nHarmonizing principle, illuminating truth—both embraced.\nLet no illusions or sorcery startle the world,\nNo strange tricks deceive the ears of the crowd.\nDeeply accumulate virtue and deeds—\nThe highest mechanism needs no grasping.\n\n**True Work**\nSeek not Southern Peak or Heavenly Terrace,\nEmpty names and forms—all dismissed.\nWealth and desire forgotten, the heart steadies,\nRight and wrong dissolved, the nature’s heaven opens.\nSincerity and stillness—action without question,\nImpartiality and compassion—virtue complete.\nOuter conduct and inner work both cultivated,\nThe radiant, perfect Lotus Throne attained.\n\n**Liu Fu’s Daughter’s Grief**\nCreation, heartless, toys with us,\nLaughter turns to grief unnoticed.\nThe Flower Keeper conjures a perfect beauty,\nBrewing a decade’s joyous dream.\nThe dream shatters—emptiness alone remains,\nYet all efforts are spent adorning the fair one’s departure.\nThreads snap, echoes fade—each returns home,\nA life left dangling in a hollow deception.\n\n**Dissolving into Emptiness**\nCreation’s tricks—none recognize,\nIts shifting wonders—who truly knows?\nLightning-fast mechanisms, impossible to guard,\nThe dark path ahead—black as lacquer.\nA hand’s turn—life and death, rise and fall,\nMorning four, evening three—sevenfold inversion.\nJoy and sorrow arise unbidden—\nA mass of illusion mistaken for reality.\n\n**Wind and Waves**\nWind and waves stir easily, grudges and favors,\nIngrained habits hard to forget—brewing joy and sorrow.\nThrough the ages, right and wrong never cease,\nA lifetime of self and others—endless strife.\nHeroes ensnared by fame and achievement,\nHeroes imprisoned by profit and desire.\nThe great cause and conditions—unheeded,\nAll day, fretting for others.\n\n**Establishing Transformation**\nOriginal truth is not form, form is not truth,\nThe gate of transformation—all dust.\nIn dust, who can open the true path?\nAmid things, who reveals the whole self?\nUnbinding the withered, loosening bonds—few,\nTranscending the common, surpassing the crowd—how many?\nKnowing one’s practice is not of great capacity,\nBest to remain still and nurture the spirit.\n\n**Residing in the Monastery**\nEndless clamor of greetings and farewells,\nHuman affairs—exhausting restraint.\nDisciples shoulder burdens, iron willow baskets,\nThe monastery’s gate—a stylish prison.\nA single lapse in vigilance—heart turns vulgar,\nGathering clods, bathing in mud.\nAshamed, the west wind blows with force,\nScattered clouds drift, clinging to cliffs and valleys.\n\n**Discussing Scriptures**\nProbing scriptures as a ladder to heaven,\nPlucking yellow leaves to quiet a child’s cry.\nAfter rain, lotuses rise from water,\nIn wind, willow fluff clings to mud—how joyful!\nHow can a mole aspire to chariots and horses?\nHas the roc ever delighted in drums and gongs?\nVulgar songs of the lowlands become custom,\nYet singing the *Yangchun* only deepens doubt.\n\n**Self-Bondage**\nBorn, yet unaware of emptiness,\nSpears and halberds grind, filling the chest.\nNot the sea’s depths plumbed to the bottom,\nNor the mountain’s peaks scaled to their heights.\nDelusion’s rope binds—three thousand coils,\nDharma’s net imprisons—ten thousand layers.\nLonging to escape the cave of birth and death,\nWho would follow an old man’s lead?\n\n**Dharma Forms**\nGrandiose dharma forms spread wide,\nAll alike—lost sheep, valleys and storehouses.\n\nAmid the cycle of birth and death, vainly emerging and vanishing,\nOn the path of names and words, endlessly haggling like merchants.\nBurning incense, stirring embers to welcome them home,\nBeating drums, tolling bells to perform upon the stage.\nWith such craving for fame and gain still unquelled,\nHow can one become a king within the Dharma?\n\n**Altar Grounds**\nHeads gather, crafting illusions to ensnare one another,\nSo skillfully deceiving the foolish, leaving them in the dust.\nPlaying false as true, turning truth into delusion,\nMaking nothing into something—what merit lies therein?\nPointing at emptiness, drawing emptiness—yet what is truly gained?\nClinging to the real, upholding the real—still trapped in the midst.\nDisplaying countless idle tricks and ploys,\nTransforming others unawares, yet blinding and deafening themselves.\n\n**Unaccomplished**\nThe kalpa’s turning grinds away, evil ever shifting,\nHow many have ever woven the green threads of good causes?\nThe fire pit roasts the body, flames leaping higher,\nThe bitter sea swells boundlessly, waves merging with the sky.\nSome raise their poles, rushing toward the shallows,\nHow many strike the oars, drifting in fishing boats?\nWhere now is the old man of years past?\nNo trace remains of the rainbow hook dangling its bait.\n\n**Awakening to Reality**\nTo sever the hanging tumor, cast off the sack of suffering,\nAmid the dust-heaps of ten thousand defilements, simply turn the light inward.\nLayer upon layer of habits from many lives, sweep them all away,\nThrough kalpas of selfish wrongs, let envy and longing fade.\nNot clinging to a single thread, the form remains unobstructed,\nInheriting the ancient majesty, the countenance resplendent.\nIn the realm of eternal spring, the scenery wondrous,\nJade trees and coral groves bloom in perfect order.\n\n**Embracing Poverty**\nA thatched hut is but a temporary abode, not the true reality,\nWhat hindrance is there in a bell suspended in empty walls?\n\n**Breaking Free**\nThis man alone can slip the nets,\nHis heart unwilling to sink in the depths.\nWhat are these heaps of kindling and clods?\nJade disks and gold—mere tiles and pebbles in his sight.\nAll illusions, one stroke to erase,\nRevealing at last the true and unerring mark.\n\n**Dharma-Body**\nThe positionless true person, form like emptiness,\nThings arise unceasing—response in an instant.\nUnfurling the treasure-store, heaven and earth grow narrow,\nReleasing the perfect radiance, sun and moon both attend.\nVast and minute, coarse and fine—all contained herein,\nBeing and non-being, high and deep—none but myself.\nThe boundless sands of worlds stretch to the farthest reaches,\nYet in an instant, all gathered into a millet-grain pearl.\n\n**Beyond Forgetting**\nThe ancient Dao-ground, fully adorned,\nLife-restoring magic herbs, soul-returning incense.\nThe entire Dharma-realm’s treasury, the true realm,\nYet our school’s light remains unreleased.\nYao’s right and Jie’s wrong—both indistinct,\nCrane’s length and egret’s shortness—both forgotten.\nGreat Peace bears no form, yet every household meets it,\nSweeping the sleeves, one returns to the land of drunkenness.\n\n**Free from the Hub**\nClear in dreams, awake in drunkenness,\nWithin and without, the same pure savor remains.\nEvery affair brushed aside, true principle suffices,\nDust upon dust cleansed, the Dharma-body light.\nA cracked gourd for daily use, hunger spurs the search,\nA burrowed den for winter dwelling, warmth comes after.\nNot bound in the world’s snares and coils,\nFreely and idly passing this life.\n\n**Worldly Entanglements**\nAmid the heaps of ten thousand dusts, gladly shouldering the burden,\nClothes must be sharp and new, food must be sweet.\nExpenses weigh on the mind, deep calculations,\nSeeking satisfaction, greed draws one on.\nFame’s snare—self-made, like a bird in a cage,\nProfit’s bonds—self-forged, like a flea’s leap.\nTaking idle sorrows for joy,\nUnknowing, one’s whole life becomes a malady.\n\n**The Net of Doubt**\nKnowing all dharmas arise from mind,\nWhy seek the mind outside?\nThe cinnabar is self-possessed—seek and gain it,\nWho makes the monkey and horse their own captors?\nGhostly faces and demonic masks, swiftly cast off,\nStrange nearness and wild traces, suddenly submerged.\nThe great refining furnace never tempered,\nYang’s ashes will never yield gold.\n\n**Seeking the Mountains**\nAlas! A stubborn nature loves to seek the mountains,\nYet upon reaching them, one recalls the return.\nBowing and rising on slopes, the burden heavy,\nStruggling up steep steps, weary of the climb.\nBears and hungry tigers lurk nearby,\nWoodcutters and hunters knock at dusk’s gate.\nHow much better to stand firm as jade, the mind settled,\nUpright and at ease, wherever one may be.\n\n**Wandering Immortals in the Human World**\nTrusting one’s steps, climbing to gather the true,\nFollowing the traces of Gonghe, neighbor to Crane Mountain.\nThe land of the Dao belongs to cloud and mist,\nThis remote place knows no dust of carriages and horses.\nBeneath the rocks, a sacred spring, cold moon’s reflection,\nBefore the hall, ancient cypresses, spring’s hidden glow.\nThe thatched hut calls the mountain boy—ask him:\n“Is there still one who summons the wind with a long whistle?”\n\n**Visiting the Five Peaks**\nFive peaks stand like walls, arrayed in mountain faces,\nCave palaces deep, encircled by layered verdure.\nCanopies stretch wide, the Jade Chamber hangs,\nStone gates, secluded, lead to the mysterious pass.\nThings pass through kalpas—where have the people gone?\nPeople depart to court the origin—cranes have not returned.\nThe noble conduct once heard—only traces remain,\nA sky of bright moon, the Whistling Terrace at ease.\n\n**Laying Down the Hook**\nWhite duckweed, red reeds—how many autumns?\nHungry golden carp never rise to the hook.\nCloud-bait, arrow-sack—vainly kept secret,\nThe rainbow rod put away, best to rest.\nLi Zhu’s eyes fail to measure, gazing south,\nMad Qu’s words falter, knowing the northern journey.\nA thousand fathoms of surging waves, the vast sea,\nA sky of bright moon, one empty boat.\n\n**Auspicious Signs on a Warm Day**\nThe courtyard’s morning brings fine auspices,\nFortune and longevity silently added to your house.\nThe illusory world of men—recognized in time,\nThe true wind beyond things—praised this day.\nThe jade flask of life-preservation gathers crimson snow,\nThe golden crucible of longevity refines cinnabar.\nWilling to come and drink on the Dark Continent,\nSitting to watch the peach blossoms bloom again and again.\n\n**A Chance Encounter**\nAwakening from dull, drowsy meditation,\nA wine-fly shatters the sky within the jar.\nBoundless realms, so vast,\nThe great liberation’s mechanism—wondrous, untransmitted.\nBy water, near mountains—new undertakings,\nFavorable winds, bright moon—old causes green.\nBefore one’s eyes, grasses and trees all speak the principle,\nCrickets’ autumn chirps—night’s discourse on the profound.\n\n**Self-Reproach**\nCreation clearly toys with this skin-sack,\nYet still I cling to the arena of profit and fame.\nIn later years, unrestrained chatter,\nGood flesh idly carved, self-inflicted wounds.\nBeneficial friends meet and part, spewing joy and sorrow,\nThis illusory body moves and stops—a dream’s drifting.\nThe world’s itches and disturbances make peace impossible,\nI recall the deep hiding place among white clouds.\n\n**Double Ninth on Jade Flower Isle**\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month in Yan Mountain, meeting friends,\nStaff and sandals wander Jade Flower Isle.\nOvergrown paths, marked branches, threading ancient caves,\nPrecipices, leaning on rocks, gazing toward the divine continent.\nAncient pines, old wutong trees—desolate in the sun,\nRed leaves, yellow flowers—subtle autumn’s glow.\nOne matter untroubled, deep interest spent,\nTurning to seek the return path, oars of a light boat.\n\n**Farewell to Elder Jinpo**\nParting words in haste, ice and snow cold,\nLike horses turning their heads toward Western Mountain.\nIn the basket, talismans and registers just transmitted,\nIn the sleeves, Kun and Wu—how could they be idle?\nJust like last year’s departure from the palace,\nAgain today, arriving among men.\nAffectionate ties resolved, heart’s matters settled,\nSeizing the east wind, reverently approaching the imperial gate.\n\n**Seeing Zhang Wenshu Off to Helin**\nGovernance is the great way of heaven’s thoroughfare,\nSun slow, wind warm, horses’ hooves light.\nNorthward journey to the Dark Waters, messages flow,\nGreen mountains arrayed, ready to send and welcome.\nI too delve into obscure searches, exhausting the mouse’s stratagems,\nYou should exert strength, soaring like Peng’s flight.\nHelin is a footstep from the Son of Heaven’s majesty,\nTogether we look up to the grace shining on the Jade Capital.\n\n**Same as Above**\nOld age brings deep reluctance at parting,\nUnworthy, I still compose a farewell poem.\nDay clear, wind passes, flowers fly in the sun,\nSpring slow, mud softens, swallows speak in verse.\nAfter parting, unbearable to dwell on past wrongs,\nGazing, helpless—soon lost in folly.\nEvening clouds, misty waves—each stage distant,\nTurning back to seek vows—who can know?\n\n**Seeing He Juchuan Off with the Perfected One to Court**\nCrane’s carriage, light and swift, rising from Yan,\nRiding the wind straight up to the Hooked Heaven.\nDragon mounds, desert sands—thousands of miles,\nSouthward plum blossoms, northward journey—half a year.\nAfter parting, who will share a laugh?\nIn this seat, with whom to speak of the profound?\nA lifetime of iron and stone, the liver and bowels break,\nOld eyes meet—tears nearly fall.\n\n**Same as Above**\nYou meet a transcendent, study like Lu Ao,\nOne leap, soaring clouds—ten thousand fathoms high.\n\n**Departing to Serve the Celestial Court**\n\nGone now, you ascend to press close by the Emperor’s throne,\nReturning here, you take your post among the ranks of immortals.\nYour dark merit, vast and subtle, bridges the hidden and the earthly,\nYour great shelter’s ripples reach even the old gluttons.\nUseless if you fail to aid the world—what worth then?\nYet fit to retire to the groves, drunk on peaches of immortality.\n\n**Musing on the Northern Palace**\n\nLeaning on a blossom-staff, I pace slowly through the palace grounds,\nThe great transformation’s tide has swept all into the void.\nGrass and trees now drink fresh rain and dew,\nPavilions and terraces bear no trace of old cinnabar hues.\nJade steps lie shattered, only remnants of footprints remain,\nThe marble stairs stand ruined, yet the ancient statutes endure.\nWaterbirds, unaware the world has changed,\nStill gather at dusk on the sandy shoals.\n\n**Autumn Excursion to Jade-Flower Isle**\n\nHigh in the Palace of Broad Cold, wildflowers bloom yellow,\nThorns and brambles choke the ancient grotto chambers.\nScattered stones and crumbling walls mark a new realm,\nWithered lotus and withered grass fill the old ponds.\nWhere now the floating clouds of caps and canopies?\nLightning-swift, the mountain boats vanish without trace.\nI turn to the west wind to ask for news—\nOnly the sky-piercing pines stand ever green.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nOn this new autumn, immortals join to seek their pact,\nWind-borne carriages descend lightly from the Great Purity.\nHundred-jeweled dew bathes the moon’s cavern,\nNine-rayed clouds veil the glimpse of Penglai’s isles.\nLooking down, the azure vault unfurls like brocade,\nUpside-down, jade flowers mirror the crystal waters.\nStriding through the Palace of Broad Cold, idly I survey—\nHow many tread the edges of the Jade Empyrean?\n\n**Recalling the Former Palace**\n\nLayered timbers, clouds massed—Jian Zhang’s halls rise,\nA long march of captives, yet the golden ramparts stood firm.\nFermented into the force of tribal strife and whale-like conquest,\nTransformed into the battleground of sandalwood and silk.\nOne night’s palace flames left only embers,\nA hundred years of men now lie in frozen waste.\nI ponder the clamor of those days of splendor—\nWho would believe the west wind leaves the grass unyellowed?\n\n**Western Flower Garden**\n\nThe imperial carriage’s dust settled, never to disperse,\nThe five-cloud towers and pavilions all turned to ash.\nOnce, the great enterprise shone a thousand fathoms bright,\nNow, a hollow name—just a cup of wine.\nThe Maker’s mechanisms play their tricks,\nThe sun-birds race dawn and dusk in vain.\nDo the garden’s flowers and grasses still know?\nThe east wind has been moved to plant elsewhere.\n\n**Lamenting Yanran’s Past**\n\nGold, like a lost deer, fled the Central Plains,\nUnnoticed, the ashes flew from the Five Phoenix Tower.\nThe palace’s halls and guards became wild grass,\nCourtiers and scholars all turned to mounds of sand.\nDrums and war horns shattered the dream of Hua Xu,\nClouds and waters first promised a boundless journey.\nNow I watch the west wind’s gentle withering—\nHow many autumns have passed since the red reeds bloomed?\n\n**Mourning Lecturer Hao**\n\nI recall our talks by the Zhang River’s banks,\nHow grand—now you have returned to your true nature.\nDiscarding your feathered robe, you first shed the old,\nThe bright crow soars into empty space, parting to renew.\nDreaming of pacing the Dipper, you wake at dusk in the dusty world,\nTreading clouds, you return to the Emperor’s realm in spring.\nThe jade censer’s yellow threads melt into ash,\nLeaving only pure fragrance for those who come after.\n\n**Staying at Five-Flower Mountain**\n\nTrue immortals have rebuilt Five-Flower Palace,\nThe mountain’s face, lush and winding, cradles brocade peaks.\nClear springs murmur through the quiet night,\nSlender bamboos rustle in the crisp wind.\nThe land is remote, the scene secluded—all surpasses the hidden,\nHuman skill and heaven’s work achieve wondrous craft.\nI ask where the elixir is refined—\nOnly the mountain’s towering trees, bathed in evening red.\n\n**True Nature**\n\nTo conjecture or describe is already to lose the truth,\nThe moment it passes the lips, it falls into the dust of roots.\nFrom one source it first arises, yet in every head it is,\nThrough six gates its light divides, ever renewed each instant.\nRound and responsive, the pivot’s wheel—all creation’s mystery,\nStir past the barrier’s bolt, and you yourself become divine.\nHow many illusions have been made into servants?\nWho remains the original master?\n\n**A Guest Shows a Brocade Bag Holding a Phoenix Beak**\n\nScarcely emerged from the cinnabar mountain, its virtue already wanes,\nHow much more the lingering taste, recalling its woven nest.\nIts five-colored plumage, once heralded—now but an empty tale,\nIts nine-fold spirit—where does it reside?\nThe great tortoise’s shell was split, yet not for its own glory,\nThe unicorn’s leg was broken—how did it come to this?\nThe four sacred creatures are no common things,\nYet even they are swept up in the kalpa’s ashes.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nThe living mechanism transmitted, years forgotten,\nNow I see the Way of heaven and earth both complete.\nStanding firm, our lineage surpasses ten thousand ages,\nRound and harmonious, it encompasses the three mysteries.\nVastly it opens the treasure store, free of restraint,\nSecretly it aligns the pivot’s wheel, brushing away bias.\nIt draws the Silver River to roof the heavens,\nAuspicious light flashes, guarding Yanran forever.\n\n**Seeing Off the Imperial Censor to Court**\n\nFrom childhood, you bore the grace of the imperial house,\nTo mend one flaw—why fear the melon’s swift succession?\nSteady, you soar through the crimson empyrean on a roc,\nFar, you sit astride the Silver River’s arc.\nOne day, the golden urn will bear the yellow roof’s name,\nAt the jade steps, in this fine hour, white hemp will be offered.\nAll admire the breath that revives the warming winds,\nA sky of spring colors spreads over the river’s sands.\n\n**Offering Longevity to the Perfected One of Pure Harmony**\n\nHolding the sun, you open the heavens, descending to the Jade Capital,\nA pillar of the Dao’s gate, hero of seas and mountains.\nThree thousand cycles of sixty years—you emerge in the world,\nNinety thousand immortals pledge their pact beyond the bounds.\nYour life-root stands firm as pine turned to stone,\nYour years outstrip mustard seeds filling a city.\nYour true form endures through the kalpa’s vastness,\nSeated, you watch the Yellow River’s currents clear time and again.\n\n**Celebrating the Ninth of September, Master Yan Zhan**\n\nIn plain sandals, you walk with Maid Ma and the Queen Mother,\nBy chance riding the wind’s carriage to descend to the Central Land.\nThe peaches of immortality you freely share with Dongfang Shuo,\nThe fire dates you personally transmit to Xu You’s wanderings.\nFragrant mists and cloud-harmonies fill the pure chamber,\nJade mushrooms and divine herbs grace the banquet of the spirit isles.\nIn Penglai’s shallow waters, idly you converse and laugh—\nHow many autumns have passed with red leaves and yellow flowers?\n\n**Seeing Off Lecturer Jia to Dongping**\n\nWrapped in the fragrance of water caltrop and lotus, I send you on your way,\nYour joyful countenance cupped, you depart the Phoenix City.\nThe warm sun steams, hastening your return,\nThe balmy wind stirs, your coral robe light.\nStartled awake from a three-year dream of your homeland,\nYou count the twelve stages of your journey.\nAfter parting, east and west, south and north—where will you wander?\nWhen will we meet again to speak of the classics?\n\n**Matching Yang Xi’an’s Rhymes**\n\nThe cloud-shouldered gates of the grotto palace remain unopened,\nScattered red rain—spring’s end is near.\nJust as the valleys and peaks recover from the breath’s force,\nAgain the river and sky turn to sleet and snow’s chill.\nThe wind carries a wrecked boat to the land of ghosts,\nMen follow the white donkey to Huai’an’s dream.\nEver has the Maker played like a child—\nBest to set it aside, forget, and sigh no more.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nDarkly I search heaven’s principles, penetrating the subtle,\nWorldly affairs, tangled, yet their patterns are easily seen.\nFreshly bathed, you shake your robes—all must be taken,\nImpatient striving, plucking the zither—only invites ridicule.\nAt the right time, seize the gap—evil encroaches on the upright,\nIn creation, scales and fins may yet be made right or wrong.\nIf only the spirit’s heart could establish the imperial standard,\nThen use what is fitting to mend decay, and what is proper to return.\n\n**Seeing Off Peng Zongdao on His Journey North to Study with a Master**\nThis parting—how can I bear the sorrow welling thick?\nYou meet a transcendent like Lu Ao, seeking the Way.\nThe crane, ever mindful, cries out through the hours,\nWhile clouds, heartless, rise ever higher in their course.\nTo reach far, doubt not—let the steed stretch its stride;\nTo cleave the ox, fear not—the blade’s edge shines keen.\nThe master relies on you as hook and line,\nTo cast upon the ocean’s isles and land the giant turtle.\n\n**Seeing Off Cui Tingyu to Court**\nBamboo and moon, pine and wind—years of companionship,\nNow parting in misting plum rains by Yanran’s frontier.\nDistant mountains inspire you to idly craft verses,\nWhile desert sands, empty of men, urge the whip on.\nEarly you mapped great deeds by the Red Waters,\nNever lose the old family legacy of the blue felt mat.\nWhen the time comes, ascend the Hall of Brightness,\nRide the phoenix, grasp the unicorn, and ascend to heaven.\n\n**Seeing Off Zhao Zizhen, Presenting the Canon to Court**\nI recall our wanderings by Golden Phoenix Terrace,\nGazing from on high, thoughts stretching far and long.\nNow we meet again to part by Yan Mountain,\nUnexpectedly, the post-horse hurries the farewell.\nThe sacred canon’s mystic radiance ascends to heaven,\nWhile frontier dust and autumn hues touch my temples.\nThe homeward date is set—our year-long pact holds:\nLet not the cinnabar heart turn to a single inch of ash.\n\n**Mourning Guo Chaoran**\nThe precious canon’s copies all proved false,\nScattered pages, broken slips—now cloaked in dust.\nStartled awake, his noble bearing lingers in memory,\nThe dream shattered, his spirit’s visage made new.\nToo late, the parrot’s wing fades into twilight’s realm,\nSteadily rides the spirit-steed to the imperial spring.\nAlas, he reaches the Hall of Brightness,\nYet cares not that tears soak my kerchief.\n\n**Seeing Off Master Wang to Court**\nMending heaven, you draw near the Jasper Palace,\nTurning the Silver River back—your merit unique.\nThe crane brings golden missives from the purple courts,\nClouds merge in hues to reveal the azure vault.\nYour benevolent influence spreads, reviving the withered,\nThe stirring winds of kindness dispel all obscurity.\nAuspicious signs must be proclaimed in heaven’s realm,\nAs we watch the roc’s wings once more take the wind.\n\n**Inscribed on the Immortal’s Terrace, at the Tomb of the Man Who Lived While Dead**\nThe numinous spring’s deep draughts dissolve my lineage’s bonds,\nThrough kalpas, master and truth share the same face.\nDrunken eyes suddenly open—the world grows narrow,\nDream-souls awaken to find sea and mountains void.\nGold and jade gleam, flowers vie in bloom,\nPearls and gems cluster like trees in groves.\nI ask the eternal intent of Zhongnan’s peaks—\nA hundred rivers, silent, flow eastward as one.\n\n**Seeing Off Attendant Pan to Yongle**\nThe immortal lord emerges from the Five Bright Halls,\nJade pendants chiming in the wind of imperial guards.\nTriple-pure clouds steam white above his head,\nNine-returned elixir binds crimson to his cheeks.\nThe Great Clarity’s esoteric will—our master’s intent—\nNow carries on Lü’s ancestral work.\nI envision the moon above Zhongtiao’s peaks,\nIts auspicious light suffusing ten thousand homes as one.\n\n**Seeing Off Li Hefu Returning to Qin**\nYou depart west from Phoenix City,\nLotus robes billowing in the wind, feathered garb light.\nA hut of reeds holds heaven and earth in a single heart,\nWhile a hand’s span of clouds and mountains spans a thousand li.\nFortunate to have met, to know your face,\nGrievous to part again, our simple bond deep.\nThe ancestral intent of Zhongnan—you alone grasp it,\nWalking alone upon the road to Chang’an.\n\n**Seeing Off Du Tianfu Returning to Zhongnan**\nIn haste we speak our farewells, thoughts drifting,\nVast the cloud-wrapped mountains, long the road ahead.\nYour heart bound to the ancestral court, scorching heat forgotten,\nYour steps follow the official willows as the frost thins.\nIn prosperous times, strive with all your might,\nWhile I, old and indifferent, withdraw in stillness.\nRemember the day we parted by the jade hall,\nEvening winds lightly stirring the lotus blossoms.\n\n**Mourning Feng Quanxiao**\nBy the literary grove’s edge, you probed the subtle,\nTurning back to the world of men, you saw the dream was false.\nThe morning dwelling held not your true face,\nYet the living mechanism was ever yours to wield.\nA pair of cranes vanished beyond the white clouds,\nNo short flute now summons the yellow crane home.\nDesolate, the old flowers and trees before the tower,\nWest winds mingle with dew, weeping in the dawn’s glow.\n\n**Seeing Off He Juchuan to the Ancestral Court**\nEmpty mountains, ceaseless waters flowing,\nCranes lament, gibbons cry—how many years have passed?\nYesterday by the altar, you stood among the egrets’ ranks,\nNow in Qin and Long, you claim the turtle’s head.\nBefore your horse, wind and moon stretch endlessly,\nBeneath the crows, passes and rivers mark each autumn.\nOnce you grasp the single net that spans ten thousand moons,\nLightly ply the living mechanism and return home early.\n\n**Master Zifeng Journeys South**\nHeaven and earth seen through as a single lotus hut,\nShifting, never abiding, roaming the great void.\nTouching things, dark or bright, he mirrors their shadows,\nAmong men, bending or rising, he sways like a swing.\nThe vast ford’s boundless waves bear the mercy-boat,\nThe ancient way’s rugged path turns the virtue-chariot.\nHow many follow, gaping in his wake,\nAs he races beyond the dust to Huaxu’s realm.\n\n**Same as Above**\nThe master first grasped the truth within,\nOnce host of Purple Canopy Peak.\nHis breath summons the single wind that names all sounds,\nThe solitary moon’s perfect clarity illumines every ford.\nNorthward, he gazes toward Yan and Ji, where light and dust merge,\nSouthward, he crosses Liang’s gardens, where grasses and trees renew.\nWherever he goes, no need to blow the warming airs—\nWith ease, the cold valleys bloom again in spring.\n\n**Laozi Crossing the Pass**\nHoary head, youthful face—a body of transformation,\nThe blue ox’s faint hoofprints tread the yellow dust.\nMoonlight sings over Tianzhu’s streams and mountains at dawn,\nWind sweeps Hangu Pass, renewing grasses and trees.\nStraddling past and present, he rides the sun’s chariot,\nEntering non-being, emerging from being, he turns the wind’s wheel.\nTo fathom the wondrous, cast off names and forms—\nNo brush or ink may capture him for men.\n\n**Mourning Zhang Wenshu, Returning to Truth in the Forest**\nThe living-fire elixir crucible—his plan came too late,\nWind and clouds idly set aside, no more chanting of poems.\nBreaking through the eight poles, his spirit roamed the day,\nPiercing the three lives, his dream ended then.\n*Chu ci*’s summoning of souls—mere empty words,\n*Yue*’s lament for the past—what use is it now?\nOnly his rotting bones remain beneath the cold forest,\nAs spring departs and autumn returns, my heart aches with sorrow.\n\n**Seeing Off Master Zuo to Court**\nA descendant of Yuanfang through generations,\nFor years he paced with measured steps to the golden gate.\nJust heard the wind’s truth depart the celestial courts,\nNow word comes of the starry audience at the imperial throne.\nBy fate, he aids lords who seek Ji’s teachings,\nWith power, he calls forth spirits like Liu Gen.\nThe mountain-burning talismans are ready for use at any time,\nTo aid the upright and expel evil—look to the supreme one.\n\n**Farewell to Master Zhao Bound for Court**\nThe post road’s ice and snow stretch long and far,\nParting words hurried over a single cup of wine.\nThe basket holds feathered talismans, their might ablaze,\nThe casket guards the spirit-sword, its light flashing.\nSweeping away the mists from the altar, he serves the king,\nDriving wind and thunder, he reaches the imperial realm.\nSoon we’ll see him blow the mountain ghosts into submission,\nNo more will they wander, lost and hesitant.\n\n**Mourning Vice Minister Jia of the Celestial Prefecture**\n*(Fragment incomplete—no translation provided.)*\n\n**Holding the Reins of Governance**\n\nFirmly grasping the handle of transformation’s mechanism,\nScattered clouds drift—when will the imperial realm’s summons arrive?\nIn the pillow’s dream, the rooster crows thrice before waking,\nWithin the scholar-tree’s shade, millet cooks once to completion.\nThe illusory realm, though wearying, is not without its charms,\nOld robes exchanged—what sorrow could there be?\nBehold the waxing and waning moon o’er the golden terrace,\nIts night-cleansing radiance as bright as before.\n\n**Farewell to Vice Magistrate Li**\n\nThe shuttle weaves without cease, hastening west and east,\nRare to meet one with green temples and azure pupils.\nWorldly dreams, long or short, are but phantoms,\nHuman sentiments—are they not all one vast primal chaos?\nBeyond yellow dust lies a forest of jade,\nAmidst white waves, a towering pillar stands.\nWild clouds emerge from the peaks, drifting without rest,\nNow borne by rain, now swept by wind—submitting to neither.\n\n**Elegy for Master Yu the Great**\n\nA master from the Purple Court, a companion of banished immortals,\nYet in the end, he set forth on a boundless journey.\nA thousand samadhis mastered within the heart,\nSeventy-one years of worldly green—now at rest.\nLeaves bright as jade take flight, the mountain cradling the moon,\nThe flute’s echo lingers o’er Yellow Crane Tower.\nGazing into the vastness of the azure sea,\nScattered clouds drift past the isles of phoenix and qilin.\n\n**Admonition to the World**\n\nSpring departs, autumn arrives—no pause,\nThe two wheels of time urge on, merciless.\nOn the snail’s horns, men vie for fame and gain,\nIn the spark’s flash, life and death are lodged.\nThe judgments of the Underworld’s clerks cannot be evaded,\nThe verdicts of Dengdu brook no delay.\nA level path lies plain and clear,\nYet why do the deluded refuse to walk it?\n\n**The Heavenly Net**\n\nVast is the Heavenly Net—none may deceive it,\nThe dark paths of the underworld are too obscure to know.\nGood causes, evil fruits—all shaped by the heart,\nHell and heaven—each fashioned by oneself.\nHungry ghosts and brute beasts, grasping at what they crave,\nDrowned souls and stagnant spirits—fools in their nature.\nI urge you: seek the way home while there’s time,\nFor when the limit comes, regret will be too late.\n\n**To an Old Friend in the Southern Palace**\n\nAmidst the clamor of drums and flutes, stepping onto the stage,\nMimicking forms, they scurry in pretense.\nWho knows the Creator’s idle sport?\nOnly to give onlookers cause to gossip.\nTheir tricks, once displayed, are but a hollow *kharjūra*,\nTheir schemes seen through—no room for negotiation.\nOn a moonlit night in the empty hall, the wind still,\nSitting by the warm brazier, a single stick of incense burns.\n\n**As Before**\n\nI laugh at my own long delusion,\nSeeking the Eastern Sea, yet wandering west.\nGrievances and favors—why speak of them?\nWhat is not tossed and churned cannot be made whole.\nThe world’s savor, once tasted, is sweeter than honey,\nThe nature of things, once seen through, is like drunken stupor.\nNow, each attains a heart of no-use,\nThe moon hangs in the blue sky, water flows in the stream.\n\n**Postscript to the Hall of True Principle’s Fusion**\n\nWhen delusion and stillness are exhausted, purity is achieved,\nThe eye beholds the all-pervading Dharma-body.\nSocial dealings, unbound, flow through the cave of principle,\nThe living mechanism, subtly moving, is none other than my spirit.\nA hundred rivers rush toward the Eastern Sea,\nMyriad lights blaze, encircling the North Star.\nI speak to the spring wind of old tidings,\nWildflowers and fragrant grasses renew all at once.\n\n**As Before**\n\nThe drifting reeds and flowing waves have not left the source,\nWho in this could discern the other?\nFrom brow’s edge to eye’s corner—all is grasped,\nBy willow’s side, before the blossoms—everywhere encountered.\nThe walls and gates are shorn away, no barriers remain,\nThe locks and seals are broken, nothing is closed.\nIn the empty hall, sitting in stillness—man like jade,\nThe wind sways the bamboo’s tips, the moon hangs on the pine.\n\n**Postscript to the *Sitting-in-Forgetfulness* Diagram**\n\nThe old man’s form is stiff as a rooted stump,\nSitting in stillness, yet restless, wandering paths.\nIn an instant, being and non-being merge with chaos,\nHeaven and earth, above and below—a single lotus hut.\nForgetting both admiration and envy of the crane’s distant flight,\nUnwilling to lightly soar like the phoenix of Yexian.\nClods of earth, heaps of dust—do not compare,\nThe vast sky, the great earth—are they not all mine?\n\n**The Chamber of Sincerity**\n\nSincere intent, rectified heart—here this chamber dwells,\nEsteemed teachers and good friends delight in each other’s company.\nBefore the courtyard, emerald bamboos stand in the wind,\nBeneath the steps, red mallows turn toward the sun.\nAt dawn, the trees hear not the celestial music—all is still,\nThrough the night window, the moon’s radiance is shared.\nDoes the falling leaf of the paulownia portend it?\nAlready, autumn’s visage spreads across the nine realms.\n\n**Leisure at Three Mountains**\n\nClumsy and inarticulate, I spare my superiors worry,\nIn my lazy nest, I still delight in pulling my sleeves over my head.\nThickly layered, the sitting mat spans three feet,\nEasily prepared, the monastic gruel fills a single bowl.\nRising by day, sleeping by night—no affairs to attend,\nCold in summer, warm in winter—what more could I seek?\nAt times, the staff of blossoms stirs a wild impulse,\nI roam the Three Mountains and the Ten Isles.\n\n**The Work of Transformation**\n\nClods of earth contend in the empty sky of dreams,\nThe Work of Transformation shifts—utterly without feeling.\nBefore the eyes, fleeting profit is but a painted flower’s blush,\nAbove the head, hollow fame is but a broken drum’s sound.\nA hundred years—long or short—mark life’s bounds,\nA thousand changes—being and non-being—know no end.\nIn the end, what has been accomplished?\nOnly the body’s play with life and death.\n\n**The Creator**\n\nFrom of old, the Creator toys with poverty and success,\nManipulating floating life as if in a dream.\nFame and profit, being and non-being—shifting forms,\nRight and wrong, self and other—vying for supremacy.\nHabits accumulated over many lives—all false from the start,\nTen thousand affairs dissolve—utterly empty in the end.\nDrunk and insensate—who is the master?\nFalling blossoms and flying catkins chase the east wind.\n\n**Following Dong Deqing’s Rhyme**\n\nFor ten years, I’ve not known the scholar’s curtain,\nTending to my true heart, at odds with the world.\nI deeply laugh at Kui’s mutual pity,\nGazing at the ant’s struggle over trifles.\nA sky of wind and moon—idle companions,\nA thousand miles of clouds and mountains—old dependencies.\nMy traveling baggage is light, free of worldly things,\nA broken gourd, a blossom staff—my only garments.\n\n**Recalling Three Mountains While at the Changchun Palace in Yanjing**\n\nOnce in Liang Garden, I laughed and sang,\nGathering herbs with the grace of a lofty breeze.\nThe winding pools and crooked ponds—such scenes,\nSlender bamboos, sparse plums—even more pure.\nAt the turtle’s back in the thatched hall, what thoughts arise?\nMy heart, at the turtle’s head in the mystic garden, is at ease.\nOnly the moon of Three Mountains remains night after night,\nAs before, golden blossoms dip into the blue waves.\n\n*The Cloud Mountain Collection,

shadows scatter the ancient altar.\nBoiling tea with fallen leaves,\nStirring the fire with mountain sandalwood.\nThe wall’s moon pierces the thatched hut,\nFragrant winds stir the medicine rail.\nSo refreshing—this pure savor,\nKindred spirits, fear not the cold.\n\n**The Master’s Chamber**\nThe master’s chamber holds the true realm,\nThe lotus hut reflects the jeweled terrace.\nThe door’s lintel hides the Three Realms,\nThe curtain rolls open the Nine Heavens.\nStriking jade, cloud-cakes gather,\nRinging metal, the crane’s chariot hastens.\nIn the grotto, people do not age,\nGreen wine ever keeps them company.\n\n**Worldly Affairs**\nWorldly affairs are boundless,\nHuman life has its own measure.\nNot understanding the pivot’s first use,\nOne is deluded by things’ emotions.\nOffering laughter to guard the eyes,\nFacing danger, one regrets too late.\nBefore it happens, first grasp it—\nLift up to climb heaven’s ladder.\n\n**Cloud Wandering**\nLoosen the moorings of the empty boat,\nUnlock the iron lock’s clasp.\nThe body’s needs—leisurely days,\nA hundred patches—old livelihood.\nKicking and leaping, one asks the world,\nDrifting, drifting—home beyond form.\nGather well the rainbow staff,\nHook and bait—drink cloud and mist.\n\n**Recalling the Mountains**\nCarefree and proud in forests and springs,\nWho speaks of Buddha or immortal?\nSweep away the reins and fetters,\nSever the kudzu vines’ entanglements.\nNot fawning in the human world,\nForgetting the heaven beyond things.\nWild clouds, the creek’s moon—\nUnbounded, the soaring spirit.\n\n**Ease**\nWherever one is, seek the body’s ease,\nNothing like inquiring within the square inch.\nPoverty and success—times’ ties,\nLife and death—the fate’s bond.\nThe wondrous body beyond yin and yang,\nThe form left behind in heaven and earth.\nMysteriously linked to the Maker,\nSilently turning the wheel of right and wrong.\n\n**Paper Quilt**\nNot obtained from the Wang household,\nFirst bestowed by the Cai family.\nThe work is easily done,\nThe warmth—no wonder.\nHanging on the wall, clouds return to the peaks,\nCovering the head, snow rests on the mountains.\nNot seeking the world’s esteem,\nIt befits this body’s leisure.\n\n**Twelve Poems Sent from the Eastern Cottage at Purple Tenuity**\n\n**Spring**\nDelighted to build and plant,\nWork follows creation’s unfolding.\nVegetable plots beside the well,\nHerb gardens near the wall’s embrace.\nPeaches and plums bloom in order,\nLush and clinging, the wild grasses.\nUnaware of worldly affairs,\nDaily life—truly carefree.\n\n**Summer**\nFlower hedges encroach on the wild meadows,\nLush greens meet the empty hall.\nTall trees—thousands of trunks unite,\nCool shade—frost on all sides.\nPlums heap ripe on the branches,\nFragrance spills through the garden.\nNo need to weigh coins—\nThe farm folk offer them to taste.\n\n**Autumn**\nFarmers gather the hundred grains,\nCrisp air comes from the western suburbs.\nSweeping again the leaves before the steps,\nAdding more thatch to the roof.\nFrost descends on the red brocade trees,\nCold hastens the saffron buds.\nNo sign of people or oxen,\nOnly the herding boy’s whistle heard.\n\n**Winter**\nDouble doors, curtains unrolled,\nThe kang warm, paper windows bright.\nNo inquiry of the garden’s phase,\nForgetting the snow-wrapped blossoms.\nBurning incense, mist’s hues congeal,\nBoiling tea, the wind’s sound rises.\nSitting in repose on the rush mat,\nWhat does the human world make of it?\n\n**Day**\nThe thatched hut—still and desolate,\nThe kitchen boy needs no knife.\nThe mountain boy forbids cunning cuts,\nThe rustic guest calls for a roam.\nPaths narrow—trampled by people,\nPlots overgrown—planted with a staff’s play.\nUtterly free of the world’s burdens,\nTrue joy—naturally content.\n\n**Night**\nThe watch late, the door unlatched,\nWrapped in coarse cloth, the Valley Spirit congeals.\nAt the forest’s edge hangs the golden mirror,\nFrom the eaves’ teeth—the jade rope’s bones.\nIn the stove, embers live on,\nBeneath the window, the clear lamp continues.\nThe night deepens—what boundless thoughts,\nThe bright moon fills the empty hall.\n\n**Long Sitting**\nLong sitting—body like a mountain at rest,\nClothed, pillowing the crooked arm.\n\n**Dawn**\nAt first light, strike the golden bell,\nThe empty hall shakes with ancestral wind.\nAs circumstance allows, all is wondrous use,\nOr let it exhaust the spirit’s power.\nThe precious tripod—clouds coil and knot,\nThe thatched eaves—qi thick and lush.\nThose who toil for gain,\nHow could they share this hour?\n\n**Dusk**\nDust upon dust—all shattered,\nThe humble hut ever the same.\nWrapped in coarse cloth, the original match,\nThe rush mat—long needed.\nSealed like a hidden treasure,\nGuarded like a luminous pearl.\nEntering the realm of nothingness,\nNow I forget my former self.\n\n**Walking**\nLeaning on a staff, walking with trust,\nForgetting schemes, even dogs do not startle.\nThe sparse fence—crickets chirp,\nThe tall tree—crows murmur.\nThings follow yin and yang’s changes,\nPeople follow creation’s workings.\nThe wilds hold boundless stores,\nOrchids and irises—lovely life.\n\n**Dwelling**\nSteady and still, dwelling with the times,\nNo green surpasses the green of absence.\nLittle burdened by worldly clutter,\nUnbound by profit or fame.\nYesterday like today,\nNext year like the last.\nThe sheep’s intent—utterly cast aside,\nWhy do ants crave rank flesh?\n\n**Sitting**\nWrapped in coarse cloth, sitting on the rush mat,\nYellow dust does not reach the door.\nDimming perception—not mere silence,\nForgetting the self—my true self remains.\nWhat need to record ancestral intent?\nThe mysterious void—best left unspoken.\nThis is the root of natural being,\nPeacefully passing dawn and dusk.\n\n**Nanhua**\nMastering the *Nanhua*’s essence,\nIts mechanisms are no longer hard to grasp.\nRelease it—boundless,\nGather it—a sphere of joy.\nIn use, it mingles with dust and light,\nReturning to the source—the rivers and seas run dry.\nThe bronze steed stands in the street,\nNowhere to ask for Chang’an.\n\n**Pure Scenes**\nThe patterned staff parts the creek’s clouds,\nStraw sandals tread the mountain’s snow.\nGathering life-giving mushrooms,\nOccasionally dining on life-extending crumbs.\nThe pine’s tip—the moon just round,\nBeyond the bamboo—the wind utterly clear.\nThis scene is not easily known,\nDo not speak of it for fame or gain.\n\n**No Distinction**\nAll things—make no distinction,\nWhere you arrive, cease boasting.\nTightly guard life and fate,\nDiligently refine private deceit.\nIn darkness, forget illusory things,\nThe true bone—yang spirit appears.\nComing and going—freely,\nUnburdened by life and death’s changes.\n\n**Qian Dongdeqing’s Rhyme**\nLife’s worth lies in contentment,\nA tranquil heart—body at ease.\nThe grass hut’s new sitting mat,\nThe alms bowl’s old cotton cloth.\nWind sweeps the courtyard—still,\nMoon approaches the window—cold.\nThe stringless lute hangs on the wall,\nIts pure tone needs no strumming.\n\n**Following the Immortal’s \"Heavenly Sound\" Rhyme**\n\n**I**\nThe pure spirit-wind stirs,\nWhere does it not resound?\nYu and Yu open all apertures,\nIts touch stirs the depths of life.\nThe lingering echo returns to perfect stillness,\nThe turning mechanism suddenly shifts.\nSeeking the true intent,\nHow could words contain it?\n\n**II**\nLeaning on the armrest—not just now or then,\nThe spirit-wind issues from the great void.\nAll forms dance,\nWhat thing does it not blow through?\nIts wondrous body lies beyond yin and yang,\nIts sound transmits creation’s beginning.\nBlowing the holeless flute alone,\nIts clear tone pierces Huaxu.\n\n**Ode to Knowing the Constant and Transmitting the Spirit**\nThis strange form,\nEver like withered ash lying in wait.\nCapturing the true—truly impossible,\nClinging to the false—what use is the false?\nThe painter of cinnabar—weary and worn,\nEver dwells in emptiness and brightness.\nA hundred years—turning to look back,\nA straw rope ties the spring wind.\n\n**Cloud

is found—\nnot a speck of worldly dust reaches the heart.\n\n**Startling the World**\nPlunging deep into the market of profit and fame,\nbound and wearied, the heart grows ever more wounded.\nDiscarding weight for lightness—perverse use,\nwhere one should build a dike, none is built.\n\n**Vain Life**\nToiling, restless, body and heart not free,\na hundred years, wind-driven foam

earth—level, serene.\n\n**V**\nHeaven’s mechanism—hints of presence and absence,\nrevolving the cosmos, the myriad forms at leisure.\nStirring the primal hinge of the *guanli* child,\nin an instant, spring’s hue fills the world.\n\n**VI**\nHeaven’s wandering—gaze as high as mugwort, none can fathom,\ndiscarding the old, chasing the new—moment by moment shifting.\nClenched fist opens, outstretched palm passes—\nthe living impulse, without fail, falls into the present.\n\n**VII**\nHeaven’s treasury—no containment, yet nothing excluded,\na single hair encompasses the vast void.\nBreaking open the seal, I show you—\nlaughing, even the ancestral brows of old would visit.\n\n**VIII**\nHeaven’s boundary—innately endowed with numinous power,\none body, vast or fine, functions differently.\nTry asking the bound wind—no answer,\nwillow tips pale green, young peach blossoms red.\n\n**IX**\nHeaven’s potter’s wheel—no self, no other,\nthe ten thousand things rise and sink, each moment new.\nWhen the last days of winter yield to warming rhythms,\nwildflowers and fragrant grasses—one and all, spring.\n\n*Cloud and Mountain Collection, Scroll Three Concludes*\n#1 After this poem, one *Outer*

trust that names and words are truly right and wrong.\n\n**II**\n\nOn the central plain, wolves and tigers rage, drooling,\nyet a peach-blown refuge hides a cavern heaven.\nFlowing water, falling blossoms—still they remain,\nI bid you board the headless boat.\n\n**As Before**\n\nAt the immortal’s high assembly, speaking of Fanghu,\nlaughing, they point to Penglai—its waters nearly dry.\nNo need to sing of herding oxen and eating white stones,\nbetter to seek the formless and demand the dark pearl.\n\n**Returning from the Fishing**\n\nIn withered reeds and dead waters, no fish to catch,\nlight bait on a bamboo rod—idle all day.\nNot like Master Ren of Kuaiji,\nwho in a small boat, with the moon, nightly explored and returned.\n\n**As Before**\n\nThe weak, mourning their lost

fitting,\nautumn moon, distant peaks—pure enough to cradle in the palm.\n\n**Self-Understanding**\n\nWorldly affairs, a swirling storm—vast as clouds,\none gourd, one robe, long carried at my

From this, teachings were established, and each generation produced those who upheld them.\n\nYet as the world waxed and waned, and the times shifted, the age grew distant from the sages, and the radiance of the spirit no longer shone. Waves surged, divergent schools vied for dominance, branches and leaves proliferated, and frivolous embellishments flourished. The great simplicity of the nameless was scattered, the elusive pearl of the formless was lost. Forgetting the root and straying from the source, people chased after sounds and colors. The true path became obstructed, and the Dao grew desolate and barren.\n\nThus, the sage arose anew, delving into the primal origin of the one qi of heaven. The great work was renewed, aligning with the convergence of the myriad spirits. Heaven endowed and divinely bestowed, striving to restore the crumbling order. The patriarch established the lineage, renewing the bonds of transmission. Casting aside the superficial and gathering the essential, he rescued the drowning and guided the lost, reforming corruption and revitalizing the Dao, until the mysterious gate was reopened. This was none other than Patriarch Chongyang.\n\nHis surname was Wang, personal name Jia, courtesy name Zhiming, and Daoist name Chongyangzi. A native of Xianyang in Jingzhao, he possessed a stalwart frame and an untrammeled spirit, his profound insight spanning the vast and boundless. In secret communion, he aligned with the abstruse, his wisdom penetrating the true source, his conduct transcending the sea of dharmas. His vast capacity took emptiness and nonbeing as its essence, the corporeal form unworthy of concern. His mysterious workings paired with the transformations of creation, and worldly passions stilled at once. He shattered illusions as easily as crushing withered wood or snapping rotten reeds, and severed doubts like uprooting mushrooms or tearing away couch grass. Steadfast as a great bell hung in the void, resplendent as a precious mirror raised on high.\n\nFrom his encounter at Gan River, he secretly received the divine elixir; through the communion of poured water, his wisdom treasury was flung open. Thus, his nature’s heaven congealed in stillness, his ocean of awakening vast and boundless. When he sat in silent meditation at noon, the thunderous roar of profound silence suddenly resounded; when the crows flew over Liu and Jiang, the moon of perfect clarity shone without end. He manifested earthly omens, deeply shouldering the celestial mandate. In the \"living death\" of his tomb, he demonstrated the profound revival after apparent demise; his spirit tablet proclaimed the eternal freedom of the primal origin. Like a rare jade blossom, few recognized his brilliance; like the reopening of stone marrow, few encountered him.\n\nThereupon, he sought disciples to carry on the flame of his lineage, foreseeing them on the eastern shores. Burning his hermitage and sweeping away its traces, he set forth with staff in hand, journeying through the clouds. To others, he declared: \"I shall capture a horse among Qiu, Liu, and Tan.\" The world, unaware of his meaning, dismissed him as mad, and none believed him.\n\nIn the summer of the seventh year of the Dading era, in the fourth month, he set out eastward, reaching Ninghai and Dengzhou in Laizhou. Raising a banner of iridescent transformation, he cast the bait of clouds and mist. Through expedient means and divine transformations, in less than a few years, he drew forth seven vessels fit to receive the Dao. Among them were indeed Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—dragons within the Dao. He bestowed upon Master Ma the name Danyangzi, Master Tan the name Changzhenzi, Master Liu the name Changshengzi, and Master Qiu the name Changchunzi. Alongside these four were Yuyangzi Master Wang, Guangningzi Master Hao, and the Unfettered Adept Qingjing, all of whom attained sudden enlightenment upon witnessing his presence. He instructed each to cultivate according to their circumstances, refining the self and nurturing the true.\n\nHe then led the four masters to Daliang, lodging at the Cizhi Inn of the Wang family in Yuetai Ward. Morning and night, they gathered to refine and polish one another, plumbing the depths of the Dao’s mysteries. One day, he addressed the four: \"Each of you must guard your own nature and life. Should doubts arise, consult Danyang. I now go to keep my appointment with the Perfected.\" The following day, he indeed ascended in a radiance of mist. This occurred on the fourth day of the first month in the gengyin year of the Dading era. He was fifty-eight years of age.\n\nHis wondrous transformations and divine manifestations are recorded elsewhere and cannot be fully recounted here. His sacred remains were later interred on Mount Zhongnan. At that time, the great dynasty flourished, venerating the Dao and its virtue. After Perfected Changchun responded to the imperial summons, the mystic wind surged, and the teachings of the Dao thrived day by day. Subsequently, Perfected Qinghe, successor to the lineage, commanded his disciples to develop the burial site into Chongyang Abbey. The place of his ascension was then grandly renovated into Chaoyuan Abbey.\n\nLet us consider: those in the world who claim to have attained the Dao are invariably scrutinized for their deeds; those said to have achieved immortality are invariably judged by their extraordinary feats; those who seek longevity are invariably expected to preserve their form and remain in the world. Yet they fail to grasp that divine transformations and wondrous manifestations, ever-shifting and without constancy, are but the objects of admiration for those who delight in the strange—mere deceptive tricks in the eyes of Daoists.\n\nAs for the root and origin, the eternal and unchanging from time immemorial, how could such things be easily seen or known by the vulgar? The Patriarch’s advent served but to transmit this truth. Thus, the shifts of qi’s movement cannot be controlled, the impulses of transformation never truly arise. Roaming freely in the boundless expanse, wandering unfettered in the vast wilderness, hidden or manifest, unpredictable, responding to change without fixed form—subtle as to enter the finest hair, vast as to embrace the cosmos, existing yet not existing, dwelling in emptiness yet not empty—pure and contending with the original state, constant as ancient and modern.\n\nThe Patriarch established his foundation upon this principle and engaged the world accordingly. Through the transformation of form to expound the Dao, he directly entered the realm of neither death nor life, merging with the Dao as one. Yet even this is but a superficial glimpse of his edge, not the essence of his nearness. That which is near cannot be fathomed even by the most eloquent. How much less can it be expressed?\n\nWith clumsy strokes, I respectfully inscribe this inscription.\n\nThe Primordial Virtue is an ocean of longevity, vast and boundless. Its radiance treasures the celestial palace, pure and unchanging. The Patriarch came from the West, transmitting this wondrous essence. With a flourish of numinous emptiness, he stilled the leviathan and mended the broken. Four disciples followed, embracing the One School of Non-Action. With single-minded devotion, they revered the ancient true visage. When the elixir was perfected and the world wearied of, he shed his form like a cicada casting its husk—shedding form, shedding dharma, returning to the boundless. Time could not constrain him, nor place obstruct. Moving between being and non-being, his spiritual powers were free and untrammeled. To honor these numinous traces, a palace was established. Like flame kindling flame, the mysterious wind spread far. The stele of Qiyun Abbey on Mount Zhongnan.\n\nThe essence of the Quanzhen School had fermented for years, its flame passed from torch to torch, unbroken through ancient and modern times. Yet those who concealed themselves in profound obscurity, making their teachings difficult to disseminate, guarded their radiance to the edge of extinction, forsaking the world and leaving humanity behind—dwelling in solitude. Their teaching took \"ascending through the profound mystery\" as its core, \"non-action and purity\" as its constant, and \"resonance with dharma\" as its periphery. Gathering the real and discarding the ornamental, returning to simplicity and restoring the uncarved block—this was the heart-seal of the Old Master.\n\nAt the dawn of the Huangtong era, Patriarch Chongyang emerged from the dust, preserving his spirit and encountering transformation, at last illuminating the light. He transmitted this Dao to several disciples by the sea—those such as Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu. Though the root was strengthened, the teaching had not yet flourished widely. It was not until the Longxing era of our imperial dynasty, after the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring arose and responded to the summons, that the mysterious wind surged, its transformation harmonizing all directions. Disciples everywhere established abbeys and temples—from ancient times to the present, never had there been such prosperity.\n\nAmong his followers was Master Ren, a man of Xiangtai. Forsaking the secular, he embraced the mysterious and journeyed north to Yan and Ji, becoming a disciple of the Perfected One of Qiyun. He followed the Dao for years, receiving its secrets in silence. In the spring of the *yiyou* year, he descended the mountain and soared like a bird, spreading the teaching through Qin and Jin, reaching Mount Zhongnan and the Palace of Longevity of Chongyang. Five *li* away, there was a hamlet called Liangjiazhu, where it was said an ancient Abbey of Grotto Purity stood—established by the divine transformation of Chongyang. The truth of this was unclear. After generations passed, it had fallen into ruin, overgrown on all sides, with only the path of weasels and badgers remaining.\n\nHaving secured this site and obtained a grant from the Office of the Capital Prefecture, they were permitted to reclaim and develop it. The abbot, Master Ren, led his disciples—Li Zhicong, Wen Zhiqing, and dozens of others—in concerted effort, laboring together to rebuild the abbey. Spanning over seventy *mu*, the grounds were traversed by paths winding through tall bamboo, encircled by clear streams. Halls and sanctuaries stood complete, corridors aligned in order, the Square Pot Pavilion nestled behind, and secluded chambers hidden in quietude.\n\nThereupon, the imperial commissioner, the honorable Zhang of the Xila clan, lent his support to the endeavor. The Pure Harmony Perfected One inscribed the plaque, naming it \"Abbey of Perching Clouds,\" designating it a place for extending the sovereign’s longevity and offering prayers and supplications. With heart’s incense frequently kindled, the winds of the Mysterious Ancestor were glorified; with the lamp of nature ever burning, the transformation of the Perfect Realization was revealed.\n\nOn the day of its completion, they commanded the carving of jade-green stone to perpetuate its legacy. Thus, an inscription was composed:\n\n*\"The wheel of mechanism renews daily, thus perfect and true.\nUpheld by profound stillness, preserved in pure simplicity.\nThe advent of the Patriarch, as if this very teaching were new.\nBy the shores of the Eastern Sea, passed to a few disciples.\nThe great revival of the Mysterious Wind, the divine vessel universally revealed.\nAmidst the vast kalpas, rarely encountered—how fitting to set one’s resolve!\nThose who enter this gate, how could they not reflect?\nRising early and retiring late, strive to emulate this way.\"*\n\n**Stele of the Abbey of Perching Clouds in Luoyang**\n\nAt the dawn of the Sagely Ancestor’s reign, he sought to summon those of the Dao. Following the summons of the Perfected One of Eternal Spring, the transformation spread boundlessly, the Dao’s radiance grew ever brighter, and the Mysterious Wind flourished. The call to don cap and robe drew crowds like mist gathering and clouds converging; the construction of abbeys and temples spread like stars in the sky or pieces on a chessboard. If even distant frontiers were thus, how much more so the Central Plains?\n\nSouth of this capital, a day’s journey away, stood an ancient hamlet called Zhuge. To its left rose Song and Shaoshi; to its right, the Dragon Gate loomed. Before it stood Mount Wan’an; to its north flowed the Yi and Luo rivers. Here, an abbey named Perching Clouds was established. Tracing its origins, it was the four disciples of the Perfected One of Perching Clouds who initiated and built it.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinsi* year, the Perfected One opened the Dao at Mount Pan, and those who came to cultivate were many, seeking to resolve their doubts. His fame spread far, and those in yellow caps and rustic robes who flocked to his gate were beyond counting—he was then the foremost among those who aided the teaching. Among his disciples were four: first, Cui Zhiyin; second, Guan Zhidao; third, Dong Daoheng; and fourth, Li Zhixi. All had studied under him for years, each receiving his seal of approval. Their hearts were in accord, and they were as friends.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *jiawu* autumn, they discussed a journey to gather the Real. Traveling from north to south, they traversed the lands of Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Lu, following the flow or halting as needed, yet not reaching the depths of Tanhuai. At that time, the world had just endured the upheaval of the *renchen* year. The northern gates of Henan’s cities lay in ruins, their inhabitants desolate. From the passes eastward, for over a thousand *li*, all was garrisoned land—wilderness blocked the roads, human traces vanished, and only those bearing arms passed through.\n\nIn the fourth month of the *bingshen* summer, the four crossed Meng Ford and journeyed to Luoyang. By dusk, they reached Chen Chang, where they encountered an old friend, Master Shi. Seeing them, he was overjoyed, treating them with great warmth and reluctance to part, hosting them for months. As they surveyed the bright and elegant mountains and rivers, their hearts found resonance, and they settled like drifting duckweed, arriving at Zhuge. Gazing around, they saw a place no different from deep mountains and vast marshes, far removed from the mortal realm—a fitting site for dwelling in the Real and nurturing vastness.\n\nInquiring of their neighbors, they learned it was the ancestral home of Dong Daoheng. They ascertained the land’s fertility and the boundaries of fields, all overgrown and blocked, with brambles towering to the sky. No master remained, only ruins and scattered tiles. Thereupon, the four resolved to establish an abbey, laying its foundation. Soon after, Wang, Yang, Jiang, and Li arrived, joining their efforts with zeal, vying to contribute. They chose the site, cleared the thatch, and reclaimed the wilderness. Breaking the withered and pulling up the decayed, they cut through thickets of thorns and brambles; sweeping away filth and dispelling disorder, they planted jujube and pear trees. Laboring from dawn to dusk, the land transformed day by day, month by month. Nearly twenty years passed, and the abbey gradually flourished.\n\nThey erected the Main Hall to enshrine the Three Clarities, and behind it, the Hall of Perfected Ones to honor the multitude of sages. To the right stood the Cloud Assembly; to the east, the Fragrant Accumulation. Nearby, the abbey walls enclosed six hundred *mu* of fertile fields. They cultivated and protected over a thousand fruit-bearing trees, while cypress and juniper stood dense and solemn, the gates and courtyards serene. Provisions for life’s sustenance were abundant, drawn from the surroundings; in welcoming those who came, they reaped benefits both for themselves and others.\n\nHere the master’s roots were honored, the nation’s blessings cultivated through offerings and rites. Prayers ascended for the celestial chart, supplications rose for the people’s welfare. Clouds and mist settled as the master and perfected ones came and went—thus was he the eastern host of the Dao.\n\nOnce construction was complete, the abbey was named *Abiding Clouds*, for it took its name from the master’s Daoist appellation, hoping never to forget him. The three disciples had fulfilled their duties; following their master, they returned to Bian. Only Li Zhixi remained for years without fail, steadfastly completing the work—a worthy guardian. Master Cui later assisted in fashioning the statues.\n\nIn the spring of the *zhaoyang* year of the *Dayuanxian* cycle, those in service came from afar to pay their respects, entreating me for an inscription to record these events. Duty forbade refusal, so I reluctantly complied, writing plainly:\n\n**Inscription:**\nGreat is the Supreme Dao,\nwithout gate, without side.\nNeither near nor far,\nradiant in all four directions.\nThe sage attains it,\ncherishing it lifelong.\nLaozi’s wellspring flows,\ntransmitted through ten thousand ages.\nIn recent times, Chongyang,\nhis dragon, his light.\nChangchun follows,\nthe true wind ever brighter.\n*Abiding Clouds’* perfect virtue,\nknowing white, guarding black.\nKindness and mercy benefit all,\na model for the world.\nFour disciples, wise and steadfast,\ncarried on the ancestral legacy.\nGathering truth at Guiluo,\nZhu and Ge revived the teachings.\nA jade abode arose,\nsix hundred *mu* of lingzhi fields.\nA thousand jujube trees,\nten thousand vistas to behold.\nMorning incense, evening lamps,\nall good deeds observed.\nHeaven’s blessings descend—\nwhat fortune does not arrive?\n\n**Stele of Abiding Clouds Abbey on Mount Pan**\n\nThe Dao, formless and boundless,\nadvances when embodied in people.\nMountains, high or low,\nare named for the immortals who dwell there.\nThis is the hidden harmony of nature’s principles,\nthe convergence of human affairs.\n\nThe mountains northwest of Yuyang were once called *Four Uprights*. In ancient times, there was a Master Tian Pan—*Tian* being his surname. It is unclear from which era he came from Qi, but he dwelled on this mountain for many years, attaining the Dao and becoming a perfected one. Though hunters, woodcutters, and common folk all revered him, his influence spread far and wide, and the mountain came to be called *Mount Pan* in his honor.\n\nAt the brow of this mountain, beneath the Purple Peak, lay a secluded and joyful vale, bright and upright, known as *Central Pan*—a misty grotto-palace of clouds and mist. Through countless kalpas, it was home to Buddhist monks. Then came the fall of the Jin dynasty, when the fires of calamity raged, valleys shifted, and the land changed hands. Once more, it became a dense forest, a haven for wolves and tigers.\n\nWhen the great dynasty rose in splendor, revering the Dao and virtue, Master Changchun of Abiding Clouds answered the imperial summons. In the first month of the *jiashen* year, he returned to Yanran, establishing the Changchun Abbey. From this, the mystic wind flourished, and the four directions responded in harmony. Daoists and laypeople alike looked up in admiration, and disciples gathered like clouds.\n\nAmong his followers was Master Abiding Cloud, who delved deeply into the profound mysteries and favored the tranquility of forests and springs, letting birds choose his dwelling. His disciples, including Zhang Zhige, in the *gengchen* year, ventured to this mountain. Through overgrown vines and secluded paths, they sought out the old site, finding it perfectly suited to their hearts. Thus, they began construction.\n\nIn the spring of the *xinsi* year, with the approval of Prefect Xu of the province, Master Abiding Cloud was invited to reside on this mountain. He arrived as summoned, and before long, seekers of the Dao flocked to him, their empty departures becoming full returns—so numerous they could not be counted. Beneath his guidance, all were venerable elders of great virtue, their conduct simple and their truth luminous. As disciples multiplied, the abbey took shape.\n\nIn the spring of the *bingxu* year, they petitioned Master Changchun to preside over the Yellow Register Jiao rites. The master then bestowed the name *Abiding Clouds Abbey* upon it. Thereafter, its fame spread in all directions. Later, officials and commoners of the capital entreated him to leave the mountain and reside at the Tianchang Abbey in Yanjing.\n\nIn the autumn of the *dinghai* year, after the master ascended in the clouds, the great teacher led his followers southward. Wherever they passed, transformation followed. Commanderies and counties welcomed them at their outskirts, and new abbeys arose while old ones were restored—too many to count—all overseen by his disciples. Most notably, at the site of Ancestral Master Chongyang’s ascension in the Southern Capital, they devotedly built the Chaoyuan Abbey, grand and magnificent.\n\nMaster Abiding Cloud, in establishing virtue and merit, began at Central Pan and achieved greatness at Liangyuan. His support of the true wind and aid to the mystic teachings were, indeed, products of the era’s prosperity. This record captures but a fraction of the truth, for the master’s legacy defies mere words.\n\nFuture scholars should take heed and strive earnestly.\n\n**Inscription:**\nThe Dao’s essence, vast and formless,\nmanifests through those who embody it.\nMountains, though unequal in height,\nare named for the immortals who grace them.\nThis is the hidden principle of things,\nthe meeting of heaven and human affairs.\n\nMaster Tian, a paragon among men,\nradiant as jade and stone,\npure as the wellspring’s source.\nHis spirit’s transformations defy measure,\nleaving no trace behind.\nThough mountains bear his name,\nhe held fast to its truth.\nLong he dwelt among the Buddhists,\nyet now returns at last.\nApes and cranes gather,\nclustering like morning clouds.\nMaster Abiding Cloud once

in silence,\nno step may tarry.\nBeyond the Twofold Mystery lies the ascent—\nstrive to emulate it.\n\n**Stele for the Restoration of Huichong Abbey at Gaotang**\n\nIn the boundless expanse of nowhere’s realm,\namid the vast wilderness,\ntwo wanderers beyond the world emerged:\none named Yan Zhen,\nthe other Yong Zhen.\nYan bore the surname Jia, styled Zhixi;\nYong bore the surname Li, styled Zhiduan.\nYan’s ancestors hailed from Jun,\nYong’s family arose in Lan—\nJun to the south, Lan to the north,\nseparated by thousands of miles.\nYet these two, roaming the world together,\nshared a single aspiration.\nBoth embraced the Daoist arts as their calling,\ncarrying forward the legacy of Changchun and Qinghe\nwith unwavering devotion.\nTheir faith was pure and steadfast,\ntheir resolve sharp as a blade,\nsweeping away delusion\nuntil their bones stood gaunt,\ntranscending the vulgar world.\nTheir vision pierced the whole ox,\ntheir blade moved with effortless mastery.\n\nTime knows no pause,\ndivision no constancy—\nas Water and Metal succeed one another,\nvalleys shift and peaks transform.\nAmid the turmoil of the Central Plains,\nthe north and

friends.\nSometimes they shared packed meals,\nsometimes labored for their own joy—\nfor over twenty years,\ntheir bond was unbroken,\nstrong as metal, fragrant as orchids.\n\nAt Chongtang’s slope stood the ruins of an old hermitage.\nThere, the two gathered tiles and bricks,\nleveled the ground,\nplanted and built,\nraising halls and chambers.\nThey laid out vegetable plots and gardens,\nnestled against hills, beside streams,\nlining them with verdant pines\nand interspersing them with flowering trees.\nThe seclusion of a hidden paradise,\nthe depth of a numinous grotto—\nnothing surpassed this.\nThus was Huichong Abbey born.\n\nWithin it, the two dwelt content,\nheedless of the clamor of markets,\ntheir ears as if deaf,\ntheir eyes untouched by the world’s splendor.\nNo schemes lodged in their hearts,\ntheir inner emptiness remained undimmed.\nTheir actions matched others’,\nyet their cultivation set them apart—\ntrue guardians of Hun Dun’s realm.\nHow

of the Dao**\n\nThe Perfected One’s clan was the Qiu,\nhis personal name Chujī,\nhis courtesy name Tongmi,\nhis Daoist name Changchunzi.\nHis ancestral home was Qixia in Dengzhou.\nFrom birth, he bore the bearing of an immortal...\n\nGifted with keen intelligence and broad understanding, his spirit soared with untrammeled grace, his insight and bearing far from common. Before reaching his twentieth year, he experienced a sudden awakening—casting off worldly burdens to seek the Mystery and visit masters.\n\nIn the spring of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era (1167), Chongyang arrived from the western lands of Shaanxi in search of kindred spirits. When he first reached Kunqian, the Perfected One heard of him and went to observe. At a single glance, their spirits met, and he took Chongyang as his teacher. Remaining close at his side, he delved into the profound depths of the Twofold Mystery, its truths unfolding day by day.\n\nSoon after, like-minded seekers gathered: Master Danyang Ma, Master Changzhen Tan, Master Changsheng Liu, Master Yuyang Wang, and Master Guangning Hao. These several disciples, sharing the same teacher, forged bonds of fellowship beyond the world, sailing the vast sea of the Complete Perfection teachings. Through the transmission of master and disciple, each embraced the teachings and received their proper inheritance.\n\nBefore long, Chongyang took only Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu with him on his travels, their fame spreading across the Four Seas. Later, they went to Bian, lodging at the residence in Yuetai Ward, where he swiftly gathered the other disciples. After some time, Chongyang entrusted his final affairs to Danyang and, without illness, returned to the True.\n\nThe four disciples escorted his spirit back to be interred on Mount Zhongnan. Once the funeral rites were complete, each discussed their paths forward and set their aspirations in different directions. Thus, the Perfected One wandered through Qin and Long, dwelling in humble abodes by streams, a bamboo basket and gourd his only possessions, a straw cloak and hat his constant companions. Self and things alike forgotten, his mind abode in perfect tranquility.\n\nAfter six years, he attained the subtleties—whether in action or stillness, speech or silence, every movement and gesture became an expression of the Dao’s workings. The gate of the Mystery swung open, the celestial treasury unfolded its shoulders; his wisdom-store overflowed, his eloquence poured forth like a boundless spring. A single word from his lips, and people vied to recite it. Those who heard of his renown came climbing mountains and crossing seas to behold him; those who entered his gate followed in his footsteps, seeking his counsel.\n\nHis fame resounded far and wide, a mountain and pole-star for all to revere.\n\nIn the spring of the second month of the *Dading Wushen* year, Emperor Shizong dispatched envoys to summon him to the imperial court, entrusting him with the oversight of the *Wanchun* Offering rites. By special decree, he was granted residence at the Quanzhen Hall. The Emperor received him in audience many times, inquiring about the Way of preserving peace. The Perfected One instructed him in restraining emotions and curbing desires, cultivating *qi* and nurturing the spirit, elucidating the essence of the Dao and virtue, and dissecting the principles of Heaven and humanity. The Emperor was greatly pleased and held him in even higher esteem.\n\nIn the *Mingchang Xinhai* year, he returned to the eastern seas and dwelled at the Taixu Abbey in Bindu, where fellow Daoists all revered him as their master. When disciples sought further instruction, he warned them of the consequences of merit, conduct, sin, and fortune. In his responses to all, he was like water poured into vessels—adapting to their shapes and sizes, filling them just enough. Many among his followers buried themselves among the common folk, some donning coarse clothing and subsisting on simple fare, their aspirations and integrity held in mutual esteem, unknown to the world. Thus, his teachings did not easily spread widely across the land.\n\nAt that time, the imperial court, having risen in accordance with the mandate of Heaven, ruled over the Central Plains. The north and south were newly united, and the Emperor’s virtue and renown reached the highest heavens. In the winter of the tenth month of the *Jimao* year, the Emperor dispatched his trusted envoy Liu Zhonglun with a light cavalry of several dozen, clearing the way to the seashore to convey the imperial summons. The Perfected One, recognizing the will of Heaven, did not refuse and set forth. Eighteen of his foremost disciples from the monastic community accompanied him. They journeyed northwest, braving hardships and dangers, crossing the vast deserts of the Dragon Sands, until they reached the imperial encampment. The Emperor, moved by his sincere devotion to the long journey, received him with profound courtesy.\n\nOne day, the Emperor inquired about the elixir of immortality. The Perfected One replied: *\"There are classics of health preservation, but no elixir of immortality.\"* The Emperor praised his sincerity. Whenever he was summoned to the imperial presence, he urged restraint in killing, moderation in desires, and the virtues of compassion and filial piety. The Emperor commanded his scribes to record his words.\n\nIn the spring of the *Guiwei* year, by special decree, he returned to Yan. There, the Changchun Abbey was constructed, and he was appointed to preside over the Orthodox Daoist teachings, with all the robed and capped of the realm submitting to his authority. He was granted a golden tally, and his disciples traveled by imperial post to deliver memorials and receive audiences. The court exempted them from corvée labor. From then on, the mystic winds flourished, the Dao grew ever more luminous, and the construction of abbeys spread like stars across the sky. Those who came to pay their respects arrived in clouds and mists. The expansion of the teachings was unparalleled in ancient times.\n\nThe Perfected One, having reached advanced age, made his home in Yanshan. He responded to supplications from all directions, and his influence extended near and far. When prayers were offered for clear skies or rain, the answers came as promised—so perfect was the communion between Heaven and humanity that not even a hair’s breadth stood between them.\n\nIn the sixth month of the *Dinghai* year, a great thunderstorm struck. The banks of the Taiye Pond collapsed, and its waters dried up; the cliffs of the northern pass crumbled with a thunderous roar. Upon hearing this, the Master said: *\"The mountain’s collapse and the pond’s desiccation—shall I not follow them?\"* Nine days after the first day of the seventh month in autumn, he indeed manifested his passing. He was eighty-one years old. His sacred remains were interred in the Chushun Hall of the White Cloud Abbey.\n\nIn the *Wuzi* year, his successor, the Perfected One of Pure Harmony, by imperial decree, bestowed upon him the honorific title *Changchun Hongdao Tongmi Perfected One*.\n\nTo speak of the Perfected One’s descent into the world: his virtue was constant, grasping the Mystic Pearl of the Most High and bearing the Dharma Seal of Chongyang. His resolve was firm as metal and stone, his nature pure as ice and frost. He dissolved the dusty passions of kalpas past and shattered the karmic obstructions of many lives. A numinous breeze brushed his sleeves, the moon of his nature hung in the sky. His great illumination reached the roots, trunks, springs, and sources, spreading like waves and branches. Knowing the constant, he abided in stillness; returning to destiny, he attained emptiness. The Golden Elixir was perfected, the fruits of fire-jujubes and frost-pears ripened. His spiritual powers were free and unobstructed, his responses to change boundless. He embodied the great completeness of Heaven and Earth, restored the great essence of antiquity and the present. He wandered without weariness, standing alone in solitary transformation. This is how the Perfected One perfected himself and became the great master of the world.\n\nWhen the Dao resides in a place, all things naturally gravitate toward it. Harmonious *qi* flowed everywhere, reaching even the most distant realms. He oversaw the construction of abbeys and the establishment of teachings, revering the honored ones beyond form and expounding the mysteries within the Dao. He pointed to the celestial Perfected and opened the path, ferrying souls across the sea of suffering as a boat and oar. Those who ascended it would surely attain enlightenment; those who practiced it would surely reach the goal. All who had feet longed to follow him onto the Way. This is how the Perfected One propagated transformation and guided the lost, upholding the true teachings.\n\nIn the early days of the imperial dynasty, when the celestial armies first tested their strength, blood flowed like rivers, and flesh filled the hills and plains. At the wave of a yellow banner, corpses lay for ten thousand *li*; where the horses’ hooves trod, no land was left untouched; where blades fell, no people remained. Jade and stone burned together, metal and boiling water turned to dust. Fortunately, the Perfected One answered the imperial summons and journeyed to the encampment. His subtle words were heard again, and Heaven’s will turned back. Those who submitted were spared execution; those who surrendered their cities were granted mercy. He counseled generals to cherish life and urged the powerful to aid the people. In crises, he rescued them by many means; for captives, he ransomed them with wealth. Fugitive servants who followed the Dao were pardoned; menial laborers who advanced in virtue were freed. He saved lives from the depths of suffering and snatched them from the edge of blades, turning the wicked toward goodness—all through the vast propagation of the Dao’s transformation. Many in the world benefited from his protection, though some remained unaware. Though he benefited the world, he never spoke of his beneficence. Such was the Perfected One: his virtue transformed Heaven and Earth, his nature transcended the emperors of old.\n\nSome, misled by what they heard or saw, presumed to measure him, but they grasped only the superficial. His traces were not his essence. What lay behind his traces was beyond the ken of the wisest or the eloquence of the most articulate—like wearing the sky on one’s head without knowing its height, or treading the earth without knowing its vastness. Those who presumed to measure him were like the blind groping at shadows.\n\nMaster Li, having come from afar, commanded this record of the Perfected One’s deeds. It shall be engraved in stone to preserve his legacy, a repayment of the debt owed to one’s honored teacher. Duty forbade refusal, so I have followed his request, fasting and purifying myself before inscribing these words.\n\nIts inscription reads:\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Everlasting Spring,\nhis breast pure as ice and snow.\nThe finest essence of mountains and seas,\nthe hero among men.\nSubtle thoughts he invariably mastered,\nrefined and utterly pure.\nHe transcended illusory realms at once,\ndwelling on high in the Nine Pures.\nDescending to become the Emperor’s teacher,\nhis radiance illuminated the divine capital.\nAlone he came, alone he went—\nboth origin and nearness in himself.\nMyriad transformations of the creative mechanism,\nyet our lineage remains one.\nLong life and enduring vision,\nthe accumulation of layered virtue.\nAfter a thousand years, the encounter arrives,\nand submerged suffering ceases at once.\nUnknowing, unperceiving,\nthe waves of dark grace reach all.\nGreat shelter for our gate,\nboundless as the vault of heaven.\n\n**Stele of the Xianning Qinghua Abbey**\n\nForty *li* west of the capital lies a valley called Huayan.\nHere, the brilliance of mountains and waters gathers,\nwhere bamboo and trees flourish in lush abundance.\nTo the left, it joins Duqu;\nto the right, it meets Baiyun.\nThe level expanse of Jade Tablet stretches southward,\nwhile Phoenix Perch rises behind.\nAt its heart lies the estate of the Xiahou,\nand amid the shimmering jade and misty haze,\nstands the abbey named Qinghua.\n\nIts origins trace back to Commissioner-in-Chief Tian,\nand the foundational efforts of Master Ru.\nAt the close of the Zhenyou era’s southern migration,\ngolden ramparts crumbled to dust,\npeople and things turned to ashes of calamity.\nThe people beyond the Yellow River and west of Shaan,\nthough restored after ruin, knew no peace.\nWar’s dust stirred ceaselessly,\nthe open wilds lay desolate,\nand of all once possessed, nine-tenths were lost.\nWho would take up the task of reviving the fallen,\nhealing the people’s wounds?\n\nThen came Commissioner Tian, dispatched to revive the land—\na brief respite from affliction.\nCommissioner Tian, styled Xiongzhu,\nwas a native of Quanzhou.\nFirst renowned for his valor,\nin the *renwu* year he was promoted to Marshal of Yangzhou,\nconcurrently serving as Military Commissioner.\nFrom all directions, those who admired his virtue and righteousness\ngathered to him unbidden.\n\nIn the autumn of the *guisi* year, the ninth month, for his meritorious service in quelling rebellions, he was promoted to Marshal of the Five Circuits of Shaanxi. He cared for soldiers and civilians alike, drawing towns and villages to him, and in the intervals of governance, he revered the Dao and its virtue. Whatever he undertook to repair or restore, he vigorously supported. Having long shared a bond like brothers with Master Ru, upon hearing of the Master’s admonitions, he honored and trusted him deeply, embracing his teachings in word and deed. The worthy and the wicked alike followed him, and he released over a thousand families of captives—surely a sign of his enlightened understanding.\n\nMaster Ru, whose given name was Zhijiu, bore the surname Ru. A native of Quanzhou, he had pursued the Dao from youth, studying under the True Man Lou Yun for many years. He mastered its profound mysteries and traveled widely with staff and sandals, journeying west to Jiyang. In the *bingxu* year, elders invited him to reside at Qizhen Abbey. In the *guisi* year, Marshal Tian invited him to dwell at Yingxiang Abbey in Jingzhao. Soon after, he came to the village of the Xiahou clan, where he surveyed the surroundings—pristine and surpassingly fine. Once a retreat for renowned scholars and enlightened gentlemen to wander and gather truth, it had fallen to neglect, overrun by the howls of foxes, hares, and wolves. He thus chose a secluded spot, clearing away the brambles and broken tiles to mark its bounds. The inner and outer fields, measured by the *mu*, totaled two hundred and eighty, and he established a deed to define their limits.\n\nThere Master Ru built his abode, constructing a hall for the Perfected, a sanctuary for the True, and chambers for quiet retreat, arranged as circumstances allowed—sufficient to lodge the pure and refined. With solemn devotion, he performed rites of purification, reverently pledging his faith to the True, offering prayers for the imperial reign, and repaying the boundless grace of the throne. At the completion of the sanctuary, he sought an inscription from his master, who named it *Qinghua* (\"Pure Splendor\").\n\nIn the fourth month of the *renzi* year’s summer, the True Man of Perpetual Constancy, bearing the imperial mandate, journeyed to offer sacrifices at the famous mountains and great rivers. Finding leisure, he visited this place and, delighted by its refined landscape and noble people, stayed two nights before departing. Behold: the heavens unfold their pattern, the earth nurtures its beauty, the mountains stand in stillness, the waters flow in verdant clarity—here alone does one move free of vulgarity, purity penetrating to the bone and spirit. Truly this is a fitting abode for those who cultivate the heart and refine the nature, where one may dwell from dawn to dusk, remaining steadfast even in haste or peril. The numinous and the earthly, in their mutual regard, lend their aid. Who could fully fathom the subtlety of his self-attained mastery?\n\nOne day, an attendant arrived without delay, entreating me to record these events. Unable to decline with feeble words, I have followed his request and written plainly. Its inscription reads:\n\nAmidst emerald forests and jade-like peaks, the visage of Fengyuan stands revealed. Beholding the sun’s pure radiance, one inquires into the misty haze. Profoundly penetrating to bone and spirit, it stills and sweeps away the mind’s deceits. Clouds and rosy dawns lead the chorus, jade laughter their refrain. Here one wanders, here one abides, finding peace and repose. The dwelling is a singular chamber, its structure pivoting on a central axis. The numinous gate bears no lock, the cavernous portal no bar. Thus is it made the lotus hut of those who attain the Dao, a place where perfected immortals come and go.\n\n*Stele Inscription of the Great Fast by Huang Ju of Biling*\n\nThe Dao moves and gives rise to qi; qi transforms and gives rise to form. Forms vary in magnitude and subtlety, manifesting as flying and hidden, moving and still, growing and withering. The movement of qi entails ascent and descent, waxing and waning, birth and extinction, decay and flourishing. Like the revolving of the ten thousand images, it knows no beginning nor end; like the succession of the four seasons, it is neither ancient nor modern. Such is the constant principle of Heaven, the inexhaustible treasury of the Creator.\n\nYet when the turning of qi brings renewal and change, when the cycles of time reach their end and begin anew, none may remain passive and await fate, nor submit without resistance. When the moment is ripe, men hasten to seize it by force; when the moment has passed, they cling to their losses and contend by force. Thus do corpses lie for a thousand miles, the slain fill the cities—some perish by blade and arrow, some by wood and stone, some by fire and water—throughout the ages without respite, year upon year without cease. The plains are sated with human flesh, the rivers and valleys run with human blood, for they have defied Heaven and gone against the times.\n\nFrom the Tang and Wu dynasties onward, at every dynastic transition, it has ever been thus. Since the august founding of the Great Dynasty, when the Jin lost its mandate, warfare has known no end, continuing to this day for nearly forty years. Wherever the hooves of warhorses tread, golden ramparts crumble to dust; wherever blades descend, men and things are reduced to ashes. Valleys become hills, south becomes north, households are exterminated, ten gates stand nine empty, and even the solitary survivor finds no escape. Those who narrowly escape execution linger in lonely misery, their breath faint; those whose clans are annihilated and lineages severed spend their years in desolate searching. To whom may they appeal? Their hearts grow cold in vain.\n\nBeyond the Yellow River’s flow, at the borders of the battlefield, peril is greater still. Souls are trapped, spirits bound, enduring long kalpas without release—only through the merit of the Mysterious may they find deliverance. Now, by the grace of the fast’s sponsors, certain officials and others, great compassion has arisen, and the highest good has been set in motion. At this abbey, they have established the Great Fast of the Primordial Yellow Register, making offerings to the Three Pure Ones of Jade Clarity and all the sagely hosts. Ascension to immortality stands opposite deliverance of souls, marking the divergence of good and evil paths; the Southern Palace borders the Northern Bureau, revealing the distinction between immortals and mortals. The altar is purified, its precincts arrayed in solemn order, to invite the descent of perfected transcendents and beseech their radiant aid.\n\nThey have further invited the Perfected One of Resting Clouds from the Court of Primordial Harmony in the Southern Capital to oversee the fast’s proceedings. Their intent is to deliver the unclaimed orphaned souls of this region, as well as the lingering spirits of ancestors from various families—those with kin but no means—attaching their names to the register and summoning their souls. It is hoped that filial sons and dutiful grandsons, mindful of their clans and ancestors, will each offer their sincerest devotion and gaze upon the true sages. Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles serve as the luminous radiance of wisdom; the stars and constellations of the altar ground become the realm of the Tuṣita Heaven. May all—whether their mouths [are sealed] or [words remain]—share in this grace; may all who have sunk into decay and desiccation be revived.\n\nAscending the compassionate vessel, the sorrows of the unseen and the seen alike are resolved; all receive deliverance, and blessings flow anew. May the ancestral line ascend in transcendence. Above, may the imperial realm stand firm forever, the sagely virtue ever renewed; may the frontiers know peace, soldiers and people rejoice in their livelihood. May the ten directions and three realms, the six paths and four modes of birth, the sentient and the insentient, all partake of the Dao’s blessing.\n\nNow this sacred altar is prepared in purity, the rites conducted with solemnity. A brief account of these events is set down here and inscribed in stone.\n\n*Yunshan Collection, Volume Seven concluded*\n*Yunshan Collection, Volume Eight: Stele Inscriptions*\n\nStele Inscription for the Capital Salvation Ritual\nComposed by Perceiver of the Constant Dao, Ji Zhizhen\n\nIn the winter of the *jiwei* year, the tenth month, the Eighth Subordinate Officer of the Western Freezing Prefecture’s Crown Prince’s Court, having long cherished a vow, undertook the supreme Yellow Register Offering. At the Yingxiang Abbey of this prefecture, from spring through autumn, halls and chambers were repaired and refurbished, and the ritual altar was prepared. Without hesitation, the Perching Cloud Perfected was invited to serve as the Great Master of Salvation, presiding over the ritual assembly.\n\nOn the appointed day, Daoist adepts were summoned, ritual implements arranged, and documents dispatched to announce the event to the Illuminated Perfected of the Three Realms and the deities above and below. With fasting, purification, and concentrated thought, the rites were conducted to shelter all beings.\n\nThree days prior, the ceremonial observances commenced with reverent offerings to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. The intent was to deliver both the distant and recently deceased of the ancestral line, as well as the orphaned souls of the realm with none to claim them, including those from families lacking proper sacrifices, who came to the altar to be included in the rites. From this to that, none were near or distant—all relied upon the incense and cultivation, universally praying for transcendence.\n\nThus, the Dao was practiced for three days and two nights. At dawn on the day following the full moon, the altar was dispersed, and the rites concluded. Such wholehearted devotion was an expression of benevolence and filial piety.\n\nTo speak of it: Heaven and Earth share one *qi*, and all things and self share a single root. As the myriad transformations ebb and flow, forms are arrayed and distinctions made. Interwoven with the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases, governed by the cyclical progression of the Four Seasons, change renews daily, and transformation knows no end—such is the constant movement of *qi*. Yet, once a form is received, it is grasped as one’s own possession. Thus, beings contend with blades and opposition, giving rise to strength and weakness, rise and fall, ceasing only in death.\n\nLittle do they realize that *qi* is what they serve, time what they follow, fate what they abide, and principle what they inhabit. Every stirring and arising has a beginning and an end. Gain and loss, survival and extinction—these are the creations of Heaven. Who can resist them? Those who act against them fail; those who cling to them lose; those who oppose them perish; those who comply with them flourish. Those who contend with cunning are exhausted; those who contend with force are defeated. Indeed, humanity’s inability to overcome Heaven has long been so.\n\nNow, the imperial dynasty responds to the mandate, encompassing all within the Central Plains. From the northern deserts to the southern Han lands, from the Eastern Sea to the Western Freezing regions, diverse paths and disparate ways have all been unified. There is no second Dao in the world, no divided hearts within the realm. The past’s warfare and slaughter have been fully endured; the extinction of ancestral sacrifices has been fully witnessed. Comparing past and present, not one in ten thousand remains. Comparing oneself to others, one’s own body enjoys peace and fortune, branches and leaves flourish, with human rank as a companion and Heaven’s protection as a bestowal.\n\nReflecting on one’s own good fortune, one thinks of the world’s misfortune; reflecting on one’s own kin, one pities those without kin. Sharing *qi* and root, how can one not be moved? Thus, the long-cherished vow was fulfilled, the sincere heart laid bare. Relying on the Primordial’s compassion to save beings, the great Yellow Register Fast was initiated. Invoking the universal power of the Perfected, one hoped for the illumination of the Three Realms, shining a single torch into the dark underworld to open the paths of the nether regions.\n\nGathering and guiding the myriad *qi*, long-sunken souls were returned to their source; harmonizing the hundred spirits, orphaned souls were all uplifted. Together, they rode the harmonious *qi*, subtly aiding the imperial enterprise. With the written word and military might unified, the myriad regions complied with transformation, and the Four Seas returned to benevolence—this was the utmost wish of a minister and child.\n\nThe offering altar was prepared in purity, the ritual conducted with solemnity. This inscription was carved in stone to record the merit, that it might endure forever. Facts were gathered and recorded truthfully.\n\nThe inscription reads:\n\nAll things flourish in profusion,\nEach returning to its root.\nThose departed, never to return—\nThese are the masterless souls.\nThe *po* that cling to their bonds\nCannot find their gate.\nClinging to grass, attaching to trees,\nThey know not where they abide.\n\nHow much worse in the dust of war,\nUnceasing for years on end?\nSlaughtered and annihilated,\nNot one in ten thousand remains.\nStartled souls, lost and bewildered,\nWander and drown in their plight.\nFollowing transformations, they come and go,\nPassing through kalpas as stone endures.\n\nNow, by the grace of the ritual’s patron,\nA heart of supreme goodness is aroused.\nThe Yellow Register’s grand fast is reverently performed,\nTo uplift the sunken and the submerged.\nThroughout the earth beneath heaven,\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nNone are distant, none are near—\nAll rely on the mighty sound.\n\nVacant *po* return,\nWandering souls regain their origin.\nThose who stood in concealment now appear,\nThose who stood like swine now vanish.\nNeither here nor there—\nAll dwell within the bound of the Dao.\nThe subtle *qi* meets in darkness,\nAnd peace may yet prevail.\n\n**Stele of the Grand Yellow Register Fast**\n\nBorn between heaven and earth,\nWe dwell but briefly, like travelers in a lotus pavilion,\nA hundred years of fleeting light—\nSwift as a white colt flashing past a gap,\nGone in an instant.\nNothing remains unchanged.\n\nYet within these few decades,\nSome live long, some die young,\nEach with a destined form,\nNone knowing their own fate,\nMorning and evening the same.\n\nHow many seek to transcend the workings of transformation,\nTo enter the realm of the Great Void?\nFrom this point downward,\nWho can strive for such a path?\n\nAs children, we are the cast-off husks of our parents.\nBetween life and death,\nHow shall we repay them?\nThus, in life, we honor them with love and reverence;\nIn death, we mourn with sorrow.\nTo remember them in village rites is the constant duty of propriety.\n\nReflecting on our parents,\nWhen they were alive,\nThey were led astray by the self and the myriad illusions,\nBeguiled by the seven emotions and six desires,\nEver deluded, ever acting in vain.\nFaults piled high as mountains,\nVirtue thinner than a thread.\n\nNow, their bones lie discarded upon the earth,\nTheir souls cast into the void.\nExtinguished, never to continue—\nYet if they do not perish, where do they abide?\nAre they here? Or there?\nDo they fall to the trials of the nether courts,\nOr wander the palaces of heaven?\nDo they pass through the six paths and four births,\nOr return to the world of men?\n\nAlas—\nNone can know.\n\nThose who dwell in leisure may yet ponder this:\nIf there truly exists a sovereign arbiter,\nWho governs the divergent paths of the seen and unseen,\nYet remains obscure and unrecognized—\nLost in boundless, unfathomable darkness—\nHow can this not be a cause for profound sorrow?\n\nThus, the filial heart never forgets;\nLonging to repay the root of one’s being,\nIts boundless grace moves one to tears of blood and wounded sorrow.\nWithout the merit of profound cultivation,\nBy what means can one deliver them?\n\nOne must therefore offer utmost sincerity and reverence,\nLaying bare the depths of one’s heart,\nPraying to the exalted Perfected Ones,\nHoping for their merciful deliverance,\nThat the departed souls may transcend suffering,\nNever again to encounter the realms of torment—\nSuch is the principle of resonant response.\n\nOn this day, so-and-so offers this rite for the deliverance of their late parents,\nOn this appointed day of the month,\nA grand Yellow Register fast is solemnly conducted,\nWith offerings presented to the sacred ranks.\nA certain master is invited to preside over the jiao rites,\nAnd the divine altar’s pure assembly is commanded to present memorials and petitions,\nFollowing the prescribed liturgy.\n\nThe ritual begins with the issuance of documents on such-and-such a day,\nAnd concludes with the burning of the memorial on such-and-such a day.\nHaving gathered for this assembly,\nAll approach the sacred altar with purity,\nPouring forth the sincerity of their hearts,\nUnited in their prayers for deliverance—\nSuch is the utmost devotion of filial children and benevolent persons.\n\nWith solemn dignity in place and the rites conducted in strict order,\nThe sincerity of repaying one’s roots is fittingly inscribed in stone,\nTo be witnessed by future generations.\nThis also serves as an encouragement to virtue in turn.\n\nIts inscription reads:\nIn serving one’s parents,\nEven in death, one attends them as in life.\nWith a single offering,\nTears of blood express one’s sincerity.\nThe spirits of parents,\nDwell in the unseen.\nLonging to repay their roots,\nOne fulfills heaven’s constant principle.\n\nApproaching this jade palace,\nThe realm of the Jade Clarity,\nPraying with purity,\nAll turbid qi is dispelled.\nThe Perfected gather like spokes to a hub,\nAll the sages unite in covenant.\nClouds and mist converge,\nThe master’s virtue is fully realized.\nCompassionate clouds and dharma rain,\nResound like thunder and lightning.\nWithin the refining fire altar,\nKarmic burdens are burned away, and souls ascend.\n\n**Stele of Nanchang Abbey**\n\nThe Dao does not discard anything,\nAnd nothing exists outside the Dao.\nIt permeates all within the six directions,\nUniting the vast and the minute in all existence—\nNothing is excluded.\n\nThus, heaven attains it and becomes clear,\nEarth attains it and becomes tranquil,\nThe Three Luminaries attain it and shine,\nThe Four Seasons attain it and turn in harmony,\nAnd the sages attain it to establish teachings for the world.\n\nIt is the uncarved block of the nameless,\nDescending to become the guiding master of transformation.\nIts wondrous workings flourish,\nIts divine power shines forth.\nWhen the wellspring of the numinous is unleashed,\nIt rightly steadies the raging currents.\nThough its manifestations vary with the times,\nIt adapts to the rise and fall of the world.\n\nThe Dao neither increases nor diminishes,\nYet its application waxes and wanes.\nSince the dawn of creation,\nThrough the primordial chaos, its origins are unrecorded.\nFrom the middle antiquity onward,\nIts exponents have arisen in succession.\n\nIn the time of Fuxi, there was Yuhua Zi;\nIn the time of Shennong, Dacheng Zi;\nIn the time of the Yellow Emperor, Guangcheng Zi;\nIn the time of Zhuanxu, Chijing Zi;\nIn the time of Gaoxin, Lutu Zi;\nUnder Yao, there was Wucheng Zi;\nUnder Shun, Yinshou Zi;\nUnder Yu, Zhenxing Zi;\nUnder Tang, Xize Zi.\n\nThese persons and their virtues,\nAll emerged from the classics and traditions of the Dao,\nServing as imperial teachers across generations.\nTheir profound influence rippled like great waves,\nExtending even to the humblest beings,\nAll recorded in the sacred canon.\n\nYet some, though their names faded from memory,\nLeft behind only faint traces—\nTheir deeds beyond all reckoning.\n\nIn the eras of Yin and Zhou,\nLaozi emerged.\nHe blunted sharpness and resolved entanglements,\nResponding to circumstances with transformation.\nReturning to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nHe expounded on governing people and serving heaven.\nThe preservation of his two chapters and four supplements,\nAlongside the teachings of the Hundred Schools,\nWas like a forest of jade vying in splendor,\nOr orchids and friends competing in fragrance.\n\nThose with hearts like frost and snow,\nClad in coarse robes yet holding jade within;\nThose who wore star-crowned hats and moon sashes,\nCarrying double baskets on their shoulders—\nThe branches of scriptures and diagrams,\nThe proliferation of codes and canons,\nThe brewing of jade nectar and elixirs,\nThe ingestion of five metals and eight minerals,\nSome refined their forms and circulated qi,\nOthers exhaled the old and inhaled the new,\nWarding off evil and expelling demons,\nEmploying talismans to govern spirits.\n\nThese were urgent practices for worldly adaptation and bodily nurturance,\nAll auxiliary to the Dao,\nYet not the Dao itself.\nIn their pursuit of returning to the root and restoring life’s mandate,\nThey often overlooked its essence.\n\nIn recent times, Chongyang,\nHeaven-endowed and divinely appointed,\nCast off worldly entanglements and relinquished dust,\nEstablishing the root and source of the trunk,\nSweeping away the waves and branches.\nHe aided the present with purity and truth,\nResponding with gentleness, humility, and modesty.\nHe embodied the great completeness of heaven and earth,\nAnd perfected the grand essence of past and present.\n\nThe Dao was transmitted to several disciples by the Eastern Sea,\nAll of whom embraced and propagated it,\nResponding to the call and harmonizing in song,\nTransforming the world.\n\nBy the early reign of the sagely ancestor of the imperial dynasty,\nBoth Dao and virtue were revered;\nAfter the summoning of Master Changchun,\nThe gates of the tradition were widely opened.\nWithin the chambers, seats were never empty,\nAnd shoes filled the thresholds outside.\nWhen the succeeding master, Qinghe Zhenren, assumed the role of grand preceptor,\nHe was honored with the imperial mandate,\nReceiving dignitaries and welcoming disciples.\nAbbeys stood in sight of one another,\nAnd even in distant frontiers, deep mountains, and vast marshes,\nThere were always those who followed the path.\n\nTo the north of this pavilion,\nLess than a league away,\nLies a hamlet called Tunzhu,\nAnd within this prosperous village stands Nanchang Abbey.\nIt was founded by Master Baoguang,\nWhose surname was Zhu and given name Zhiming,\nA native of this land,\nBaoguang being his Daoist name.\n\nIn his prime, he was exceptionally perceptive,\nRenouncing the secular to pursue the Dao.\nHe studied under Master Baoyang, Liu Zhifu,\nA foremost disciple of the Great Ancient Perfected One.\nThe master personally guided him,\nTransforming him day by day and month by month,\nUntil he received the seal of transmission.\n\nIn middle age, he returned to his parents’ homeland,\nSurveying his former residence,\nOnly to find it overgrown and desolate,\nLittle more than its foundations remaining.\nThe master led his disciples to reclaim the wasteland,\nClearing paths and cultivating the wilds,\nAcquiring land measured in acres, half a qing in total.\nWhen the prefectural lord, Magistrate Zhang, granted an official document to authorize it,\nThey began construction—\nRaising beams, erecting walls,\nPlanning and building—\nAnd in less than ten days,\nThe great work was accomplished.\n\nA hall was dedicated to the Most High,\nA meeting hall for the purchase of blessings,\nWhere the pure countenance of the Perfected could be venerated,\nFulfilling the deepest wishes of the people.\nOfferings were made with reverence at dawn,\nAnd incense burned steadfastly at dusk.\n\nThe great work upholds the imperial enterprise,\nExtending the sacred mandate’s vast prosperity,\nIts blessings reaching far and near,\nIts waves touching all living beings.\nTo repay the root and honor the master,\nTo requite the nurturing of virtue and power—\nThis is the very purpose here.\n\nAt the outset of its completion,\nA name was sought from the patriarchal master,\nAnd it was inscribed as \"Nanchang.\"\nAfter the work was done,\nThe master concealed his wild words,\nAnd departed with that which cannot be spoken.\n\nWhat has been transmitted through the ages,\nAll that is heard and seen—\nThese are not the true essence.\nTraces are not the root.\nThe root lies in tranquility and stillness,\nIn emptiness and non-action—\nThis is the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth,\nThe rectitude of the Dao and virtue,\nPreserved within our lineage alone,\nBeyond the reach of perception or hearing.\n\nThus, the ephemeral vanishes,\nThe withered revives,\nPeople are no longer illusory beings,\nNor things mere phantom realms.\nThis is how the sage instructs humanity,\nAnd therein lies the way of master and disciple.\n\nThe construction of this abbey and temple\nTakes form to manifest sincerity and luminous ritual,\nServing as a means for the state’s cultivation and refinement—\nProfound indeed is its significance!\n\nWhen the abbey’s overseer, Liu, arrived without hesitation to request a record of these events,\nI sought to recount the achievements of those who came before,\nHoping to inspire those yet to come.\nThus, I could not decline with feeble words,\nAnd so I followed his request and wrote plainly.\n\nIts inscription reads:\n\nThe immortals of successive ages,\nTheir axis turns in perfect round.\nIn decline or rise, they follow the world’s flow,\nIn concealment or revelation, they obey heaven’s decree.\n\nFrom Chongyang the source arose,\nChangchun flourished most brightly.\nThe true wind was greatly revived,\nThe orthodox mandate fully upheld.\n\nThere was one called Baoyang,\nWhose heir preserved its radiance.\nA descendant of the Great Antiquity,\nHis Dao’s worth spread in all directions.\n\nIn his native land, he planned and built,\nPerfecting this sublime sanctuary.\nWith blessings as wings he sustained it,\nWith virtue as carriage he bore it.\nIn wandering or dwelling, in rest or sleep,\nHe never forgot his devout cultivation.\n\nFor the emperor’s longevity he prayed,\nThat earth endure and heaven last long.\nFor the people’s fortune he entreated,\nWith boundless abundance and blessings.\nMorning and evening, with earnest devotion,\nA single incense burned in the hearth.\n\n*An Encounter with a True Record: The Story of Chaoyun of Qin*\n\nThere was a man named Chaoyun of Qin,\nHis clan and homeland unknown.\nTo escape the corvée of Qin Shi Huang’s wall-building,\nHe fled to the foothills of Mount Taihang,\nPushing through brambles and vines,\nScaling perilous heights,\nPressing ever onward toward the remote and secluded,\nWhere even bird tracks and human traces could not reach—\nOnly then did he stop.\n\nHe ate from the trees and drank from the streams,\nUntil he came upon a dense forest of thickets,\nWhere he built a nest and dwelt above,\nHence his name, Chaoyun—Nest Cloud.\n\nThis man,\nOnce entangled in the world’s clamor and constraint,\nShed its burdensome ties,\nBreaking free from its snares like a fleeing hare.\nWith trees and rocks as neighbors,\nDeer and boars as companions,\nHe escaped the suffering of human servitude and oppression,\nLiving freely and unrestrained,\nVowing to spend his life thus.\n\nLong accustomed to emptiness and stillness,\nHe passed days and months in quietude,\nFinding them ever longer;\nWalking amidst clouds and mist beyond the world,\nHe could not contain his joy.\nRecalling the past,\nAmid the tumult of clamoring crowds,\nBraving the suffocating yellow dust,\nIt was as if trapped in a searing furnace or boiling cauldron,\nSteamed and scorched—\nWho could describe such torment?\n\nNow,\nThough he trod paths where jackals and tigers roamed,\nClimbed cliffs where apes and monkeys dwelled,\nCut off from the world,\nWhat else could he seek?\nOnly to attain ease and tranquility,\nTo avoid disturbing the natural course of life.\n\nWhether walking or standing,\nSitting or lying,\nHe would pause and gaze around:\nThe mountains, silent;\nThe waters, clear and cold.\nBirds sang in harmony,\nBeasts grew tame and familiar.\nGrasses and trees vied in beauty,\nPeaks and ridges competed in grandeur—\nHe deemed Penglai’s paradise,\nThe Jasper Pool’s fairyland,\nThe grotto-heavens and celestial palaces,\nNone could surpass this.\n\nAt times,\nBeneath pine shadows and grassy paths,\nHair unbound, he sang as he walked;\nAt the forest’s edge or by the stream,\nHis solitary form danced with its shadow—\nSuch was his joy.\n\nAfter years of dwelling here,\nWorldly cares vanished entirely.\nHe knew not whether the world had turned to Han or Wei,\nNor whether his own fleeting form\nWas a thing or himself.\n\nHe loathed yellow essence,\nFeared the allure of green herbs,\nDrank from pure springs,\nSat upon white stones.\nHis form dissolved into reverie,\nAs if in a light slumber.\n\nThen,\nAn aged immortal appeared—\nYouthful temples, square pupils,\nA fine beard, hair coiled in a topknot—\nHolding a sprig of lingzhi,\nTreading auspicious clouds,\nHe descended beside him.\nPointing, he called out:\n“You, who are infatuated with mountains and forests,\nEnamored of springs and stones,\nDiffer little from those who lose themselves in the dusty world.\nHaving long delighted in stillness,\nSorrow and movement must follow.\nI now bestow upon you the nameless simplicity to anchor it,\nThat you may break free from the bonds of stillness\nAnd ascend beyond Kunlun’s peak.\nDo you desire this?”\n\nChaoyun rose abruptly,\nBowed deeply, and pressed his forehead to the ground,\nThen crawled forward on his knees:\n“Dare I ask the method?”\n\nThe old immortal commanded him to sit in silence,\nClose his eyes and cover his ears.\nThen, with a sharp blade, he split his chest and removed his heart,\nBefore sealing it again,\nApplying a divine medicine.\n“Nameless simplicity,\nThe seed of immortals and sages,\nNow rests within your breast.\nGuard it well.”\n\nThereafter,\nChaoyun entered a profound void,\nA deep obscurity—\nHe knew not how or why,\nOnly that it was so.\n\nAfter a long while,\nAs if awakening from sleep,\nOr sobering from drunkenness,\nHe looked around—\nThe old immortal was gone.\nHe touched his chest—\nIt was whole, as before.\nSuddenly,\nHe felt hollow and refreshed,\nHis spirit bright and clear,\nHarmonious qi spreading throughout,\nHis entire being at peace.\nAn inner celestial light shone forth,\nRevealing his innate purity.\n\nThen,\nAs if newly awakened,\nHe felt vast and unbound,\nThe breadth of the sea could not compare to his greatness,\nThe leisure of clouds and waters could not match his ease.\nHe passed through the mysterious barrier,\nHis wisdom treasury now lucid,\nAttaining the sight of no-seeing,\nThe knowledge of unknowing.\n\nMerging with heaven and earth in primordial chaos,\nHarmonizing with the myriad things as one,\nThere was no other, no self.\nWithin and without, vast and deep,\nAll was one body, all-pervading.\nGreat and small, coarse and fine,\nAll were contained in a single nature.\n\nThen,\nHe danced and leapt,\nChanting soundless poems,\nPlaying a flute without holes,\nStrumming a zither without strings,\nSinging a song of no-birth—\nIts resonance shook heaven and earth,\nYet the world never heard it.\n\nThus,\nDragon roars and phoenix cries,\nCranes dancing, simurghs soaring,\nTreading the void, riding the wind,\nCommanding qi—\nAll could be done,\nAnd could not but be done.\n\nAfter dwelling in the mountains for many years,\nWoodcutters and hunters occasionally glimpsed his strangeness.\nHis fame could not be concealed,\nPaths gradually formed,\nAnd one or two seekers of the Dao came to visit.\n\nThere was a scholar, Rong Bohua,\nWho, hearing of Chaoyun’s reputation,\nBraved rugged terrain to see him.\nAccompanied by several others,\nUpon arrival, they saw Chaoyun’s withered, mountain-worn form\nAnd reproached him:\n“A true man’s breast cradles brocade,\nHis spirit exhales rainbows,\nHe stands above all things,\nHis grace nourishes even the grasses.\nHe builds great deeds,\nAttains great renown,\nWalks the golden halls,\nSounds the jade chimes.\nAmong birds, he is the phoenix;\nAmong beasts, the dragon.\nBetter to be the beak of a chicken\nThan the rump of an ox—\nThis is the shared desire of all.\nYet you alone, so despondent and cramped,\nCower in these deep mountains and barren valleys,\nScarcely better than a well-frog or ditch-turtle.\nHow can you bear such indignity?”\n\nChaoyun lifted his head, sighed to the heavens,\nAnd slowly replied:\n“Have you not seen\nBetween heaven and earth,\nThe flow of a single qi,\nThe opening and closing of yin and yang,\nThe transformations of clouds and rain,\nThe illumination of sun and moon,\nThe stirring of wind and thunder,\nThe life and death of frost and dew?\nEach serves its purpose differently—\nAll arise from heaven and tend upward.”\n\nThe stillness of mountains, the flow of rivers,\nThe dryness of fire, the hardness of metal,\nThe growth of trees, the firmness of stone,\nThe flight of birds, the running of beasts,\nThe swimming of fish, the movement of insects—\nEach soars, creeps, wriggles, or crawls in its own way,\nAll rooted in earth and drawn downward.\n\nTheir inherent divisions are fixed, unchangeable.\nOne cannot resent what is already determined,\nNor foresee the ceaseless transformations of the new.\nYet men, with their cunning calculations,\nSeek to seize by force—\nHow could one leap ranks and attain what is not theirs?\nThis is what is meant by \"not knowing the constant and acting recklessly.\"\n\nThe fineness of an autumn hair, the vastness of Mount Tai,\nThe longevity of Pengzu, the early death of Yanling,\nThe wealth of Chong, the poverty of Xian—\nAll are fixed by their inherent divisions.\nViewed through the Dao,\nAll forms and numbers, fleeting as they are, dissolve into emptiness.\nThus great and small, long life and early death,\nWealth and poverty, nobility and lowliness—\nNone differ in essence.\n\nWithin me abides that which is neither great nor small,\nNeither form nor number,\nNeither long life nor early death,\nNeither wealth nor poverty,\nNeither noble nor base.\nIt endures through kalpas, unchanging—\nWhat then should I resent?\n\nBohua said: *\"One with extraordinary talent serves the world and shelters others.\nBut you, though human, are of no use to the world—\nYou are merely a useless man.\"*\n\nChaoyun replied: *\"You see uselessness as suffering,\nYet do not know the harm of being useful.\nAll things that live,\nBound by the constraints of body and mouth,\nAre controlled by others and suffer in their existence.\nLike horses made to travel far,\nOr oxen made to pull heavy loads—\nBridled in front, whipped from behind,\nThey endure the comfort of fodder and beans\nOnly to have their natural lives destroyed.\nThus it is said:\nThe skillful are always labored,\nThe wise are always anxious.\nStraight trees are felled first,\nSweet wells are drained first.\nLacquer is cut for its use,\nCinnamon is broken for its flavor.\nFat is rendered for its light,\nCharcoal is burned for its heat.\nFleas are boiled for their dye,\nBirds are caged for their speech.\nAll these suffer because the world finds them useful—\nThey cannot rest in their natural state.\"*\n\nBohua said: *\"Uselessness may be good,\nBut how does it nourish life?\"*\n\nChaoyun replied: *\"What the world calls 'nourishing life'\nIs merely filling the mouth and body—\nKnowing the tools of life,\nBut not its master.\nWhat masters life is spirit.\nWhen spirit abides, life endures;\nWhen spirit departs, life ends.\nTo cling to life and seek nourishment\nIs to violate the master of spirit—\nOffering fragrance and flavor to the mouth and nose,\nColors and sounds to the ears and eyes,\nIndulging the six desires, seven emotions,\nThree poisons, five impurities,\nCountless delusions and evils—\nAll harm the spirit.\nWhen spirit is harmed, it departs;\nWhen spirit departs, the body perishes;\nWhen the body perishes, what life remains?\nThus what the world calls 'nourishing life'\nCannot preserve life—\nBecause it fails to embrace uselessness.\"*\n\nBohua said: *\"What is the use of uselessness?\"*\n\nChaoyun replied: *\"Have you not seen\nWater that is still and thus clear,\nA mirror that is unstained and thus bright?\nThings come, and it reflects them;\nIt responds but does not retain,\nIlluminates but does not hoard,\nUses but is not used—\nThis is the use of uselessness.\nBecause it is useless, its body is never wearied and remains at rest.\nBecause it does not cling to illumination, its brightness is never harmed and remains constant.\nIf the heart seeks to be useful,\nEyes see without seeing,\nEars hear without hearing,\nMouth speaks without speaking,\nNose smells without smelling,\nHands grasp without grasping,\nFeet walk without walking—\nAll limbs and senses become unruly,\nLike one afflicted with wind-stroke or paralysis.\nBut when the heart is useless, the body serves its function.\nWhen the vast heavens do nothing, the ten thousand images move of themselves.\nWhen the great earth is incapable, the ten thousand things transform of themselves.\nUseless—yet nothing is not used.\nThoughtless—yet nothing is not thought.\nActionless—yet nothing is not done.\nHeaven and earth are connected,\nCreation is the same,\nSpirits cannot fathom it,\nFrom the vast to the minute—\nAll reside within my nature,\nUnchanged through ten thousand kalpas.\nHow could I concern myself with dust, chaff, or illusory forms?\nGo—you are a vulgar man.\nDo not disturb my affairs.\"*\n\nBohua stood dumbfounded, mouth agape, unable to speak.\nAfter a long while, he bowed and departed.\n\n---\n\n**Record of Shenqing Abbey in Kaizhou**\n\nThe Dao flourishes in the world,\nAnd the world flourishes through the Dao.\nWhen Dao and world rise together,\nAll drink from the mysterious transformation,\nForgetting their grasping and scheming ways.\nPeople daily turn toward goodness,\nPreserving their natural state,\nNever transgressing their allotted divisions or disrupting the constant—\nIs this not an era of great peace?\n\nWhat small aid does the Dao offer the world?\n\nWhen the imperial court underwent revolution and all was in ruins,\nAfter Master Changchun answered the summons,\nHis carriage rested at Yanran,\nThe stone marrow reopened,\nThe jade caskets were unsealed again,\nAnd those across the land who turned toward the wind\nHastened to draw near.\n\nAmong those of surpassing resolve,\nWho did what others could not,\nThere was Master Zhang—\nHe was such a man.\nHis name was Zhixin, his sobriquet Xiaoyaozi,\nA native of Zhangchuan.\nHis nature was unyielding, scorning worldly entanglements.\nDuring the chaos of the Zhenyou era’s southern migration,\nBandits gathered, attacking and plundering.\nFearing the disaster would reach him,\nHe saw his own body as the greatest peril.\nHe fled to the deep mountains and barren valleys,\nSeeking a way to transcend the world—\nBut had not yet found it.\n\nHearing that Master Wang Qiyun was opening the Dao at Mount Pan,\nAnd that many seeking the Way followed him,\nHe traveled a thousand *li* without hesitation,\nPressing forward to inquire into the truth—\nAnd was deeply approved.\nAfter a long time, he was permitted to join the assembly,\nAttending reverently, never resting,\nExhausting its mysteries.\n\nWhen he later descended the mountain,\nHe lived in a thatched hut, eating wild plants.\nWhat his heart held\nWas no longer what his former self could have done.\nHe took heaven and earth as his lotus hut,\nHis body as a temporary lodging,\nWearing hempen robes and a rope belt,\nHis face unwashed, his hair unkempt—\nThe passing of seasons and the changing of cold and heat\nMeant nothing to him.\n\nFrom beginning to end, his resolve never wavered.\nHe bore the form of a man,\nYet was without the passions of men.\nHe regarded the comings and goings of worldly things,\nThe entanglements of human affairs,\nAs but birds, sparrows, mosquitoes, or gnats passing before him—\nNever once did they trouble his mind.\nCould one who had not attained realization within\nEver be thus?\n\nTruly, by guarding the spirit in stillness,\nConcealing the self in profound obscurity,\nHe grasped that Great Root and Great Origin\nWhich has endured from ancient times to the present.\n\nThe world, observing from without,\nSaw only his austere and arduous discipline,\nBeyond what others could endure—\nHow could the common eye perceive the mysteries he had unlocked?\n\nIn the autumn of the *dinghai* year, in the seventh month,\nThe Master arrived at Chanyuan.\nThe townsfolk, struck by his uncommon presence,\nGazed upon him as though he were a spirit to be revered.\nMagistrate Zhao, upon meeting him, earnestly entreated him to stay,\nAnd lodged him in the Temple of the Divine Manifestation of the True Lord,\nSending provisions from time to time.\nFrom then on, those who sought his gate\nCame in such numbers that they could not all be counted.\nHis disciples numbered in the hundreds—\nThey sat without instruction,\nStood without discourse,\nYet departed filled where they had come empty.\n\nChief Cai, admiring his character,\nGranted him fields beside his own temple,\nFormally deeding the land to him.\nThere, a dwelling was built,\nThat he might reside and make it his home.\nCommissioner Wang, praising his strict and solemn conduct,\nProvided funds and support,\nAnd the temple gradually took shape.\nThe main hall was restored to enshrine the Three Pure Ones,\nFollowed by the construction of halls and kitchens\nTo accommodate the quiet and the devout.\nQuarters and chambers were arranged\nTo suit the blessed site.\n\nUpon its completion,\nA petition was sent to the Patriarchal Perfected One,\nWho bestowed upon it the name *Divine Clarity*.\n\nLet us consider this:\nMan is established through the Dao,\nAnd the Dao is magnified through man.\nWhat is realized within\nManifests without.\nThus, when Master Kangcang dwelt in Lu,\nThe common people longed to offer him sacrifices as to She and Ji.\nWhen Lie Yukou journeyed to Qi,\nThe wine-sellers vied to serve him with reverence.\nFor one who preserves the nature of the self\nAnd harmonizes it with the nature of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,\nThere is nothing that cannot be penetrated.\nOne who safeguards the harmony of the self\nAnd unites it with the harmony of heaven, earth, and the myriad things,\nThere is nowhere that cannot be reached.\nFrom this perspective,\nTo move the lofty and profound,\nTo stir ghosts and spirits,\nTo enter water and fire,\nTo pierce metal and stone—\nAll things, great and small, respond.\nHow much more so for men?\n\nWho would not love and revere\nOne who offers harmony to others?\nMaster Zhang, styled Xiaoyao,\nTruly possessed such virtue.\n\nHis disciple Zhao Zhiwan,\nRecalling his master’s aspirations and conduct,\nAnd reflecting on the nearness of his former dwelling,\nSought to engrave his story in stone to preserve his legacy,\nAnd entreated me to compose this account.\nThough I declined, he would not accept my refusal,\nSo I have gathered these details and set them down.\n\nRecorded on the fifth day after the full moon of the first spring month,\nIn the year of *qiangyu*, the *dahuangluo* epoch.\n*Collected Works from Cloud Mountain*, Volume Eight, concludes.",

The laughter shared at Tiger Creek,\nThe solitary sigh of Nan-guo gazing at the sky.\nShu’s nine years of study perfected the great mystery;\nA single night’s affirmation left no residue.\n\nFor vast or minute, coarse or fine, every phenomenon embodies the Dao;\nFrom soaring birds to hidden fish, each form is true suchness.\nGongsun’s sophistry debates the \"not-horse\";\nHui Shi’s many devices question the joy of fish.\n\nHark! Scraping the wild elder’s eyes,\nSevering the mountain boy’s finger.\nCan one’s response be anything but a single \"yes\"?\nYan Hui sat in forgetfulness and attained mastery.\n\nDeluded, the Jingwei bird carries earth to fill the sea;\nEnlightened, the formless one seeks the pearl in the Red River.\nA single misstep in action strays by a mile;\nA word spoken misses by a thousand.\n\nYet to act with abandon is unobstructed;\nThe brush’s fall sweeps away all dust and grime.\n\n---\n\n**Rhapsody on the Heart-Mind**\nIts nature arises from the Dao, its emotions are born of the heart-mind.\nGathering the roots of the senses, it governs the throat of good and evil.\nThoughts flow ceaselessly, the past does not halt, the present does not cease;\nEver renewing, it surfaces in motion and sinks in stillness.\n\nWhen it is neither being nor non-being, it is perception and cognition.\nEmerging, it clings to affairs and attaches to things;\nMoving, it chases sounds and pursues forms.\nIt cannot be abandoned, nor can it be grasped.\n\nIt commands the legions of demonic grasses, enduring through kalpas;\nSeated as the chief of the three karmas, it is never mastered.\nYet when worldly cares are stilled, the spirit abides in clarity.\nLight blazes from cold ashes, auspiciousness arises in an empty chamber.\n\nVast beyond all bounds, it conceals the subtlest traces.\nShedding all entanglements, it arrives at unknowing yet feels near;\nIn steadfast embrace, it adapts to every use with ease.\n\nEven in lighting incense, brewing tea, or sweeping the floor,\nWhatever is casually grasped responds in kind;\nWhatever is set down aligns perfectly.\nThe Yangtze, the Yellow, the Huai, and the seas—though their currents differ, their waters are one;\nHairpins, bracelets, broken plates—though their uses vary, their gold is the same.\n\nAdapting to circumstances, it shifts its form;\nFollowing conditions, it generates hues.\nIn stillness, it congeals like earth; in motion, it hangs like heaven.\nWhen needed by the feet, it moves in crossed legs or paces;\nWhen needed by the hands, it clenches into fists.\n\nIn action or rest, lifting or plucking, it presides as the formless master;\nIn seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving, it occupies the moment before engagement.\n\nYet to transcend the ten stages and three vehicles,\nTo encompass the five phases and four images—\nStanding centered without leaning, preserving inner harmony without wavering—\nA moment’s pride in superior insight may plunge one into today’s itch for scratching.\n\nWhere lies the essence of the Wei and Si traditions? In entering the hall and ascending the room.\nWhat is the wonder of Zhuangzi’s garden? In pushing open the gate and laying down the staff.\n\nHow grand! A single aperture opens, eight faces gleam.\nThe pearl glows atop the void, the cinnabar circles within the jeweled tripod.\nMerging heaven and earth into one body, it seizes creation to share its work.\n\nWithout image or self, it nurtures all like spring’s warmth;\nUnobstructed and unclinging, it traverses the sky like the autumn moon.\n\nAh! Those who follow affairs and find peace return home by the road;\nThose who use things as they are attain wonder in the flow.\nThe great measure of rivers and seas—what does it not contain?\nThe high-hung sun and moon—what place do they not illuminate?",

Like lotus roots coiled in green mud, we prolong our entanglement.\nWho knows if the Creator merely plays with us, shifting valleys and boats east and west in the dead of night?\nThe heart is assailed by profit and desire, a spectacle more frenzied than the Yellow Gate’s turmoil;\nDazzled by empty flowers, we mistake them for reality.\nThe wind’s blade and kalpa-fire descend from heaven, fanning flames that scorch Kunlun’s jade and stone.\nWorldly dust is swept away, all reduced to emptiness—until great pardon opens the cage.\nOnly then do we realize the yellow millet remains uncooked, suddenly startled by the wind at the tower’s eaves.\nOpening our eyes, we recognize the nightmare’s horror; reflecting deeply, we see past affairs were all mistaken.\nHeaven grants me good causes, leaping from the dust to attain true joy.\nIf asked how to reach emptiness without reliance, how could it compare to turning the wheel of the Profound Mystery?\nThe work complete, I shed this mortal garb, riding the wind back to the Five Clouds’ palace halls.\n\n**Verifying Illusions**\nThe Daoist plays in the true samādhi, transforming with divine powers swift as a fox.\nSilent as the abyss, yet thunder shakes the nine heavens; dwelling in stillness, yet sunlight illumines the dusty world.\nThe golden rooster crows—clay oxen flee; withered trees roar like dragons, stubborn stones howl.\nJade maidens play flutes, phoenixes sing; wooden men dance in rhythm, sinews twisting.\nThe subtlest movements trigger heaven’s gate-mechanism, clapping the void without end.\nNeither being nor non-being, beyond measure—who can fathom it?\nNow reversing, now flowing—who can know?\nThe great wonder demands nine years of cultivation; the seven sages lose their way on the path.\nPushing the staff and setting it down—when will they meet? Winking and blinking, they merely peer in vain.\n\n**Verifying Dreams**\nOf old, I heard of King Mu’s journey to the Dark Palace, where azure towers and crimson gates stood amid clouds.\nYet shifting to higher realms brought terror, and the heavenly wind blew him back to his cage.\nI also heard of the Yellow Emperor’s land of Huaxu, where he walked the void as if treading solid ground.\nClouds and mist dissolved, mountains and valleys leveled—yet it still resembled emerging from a mural’s forest.\nSpirit-wandering in dreams never leaves one’s place; riding the wind to the moon is not the constant way.\nA single leap straight to Kunlun’s summit—who inherits the original, inherent truth?\nThe dusty world drifts in dream’s upheaval, truth and illusion vie like deer in a dispute.\nThe locust’s branches and ant’s battles rage—what are they but clamoring oysters and warring snails?\nAwake or dreaming, both arise from primordial chaos; now, in waking or sleeping, I remain of the same lineage.\nI ask the master: have you opened your eyes yet?

dawn to dusk,\nAnxious with joy and sorrow.\nMatters of self dissolve to naught—\nHow much more those beyond?\nEndless affairs of others,\nFortune and misfortune shown to you.\nEvil thoughts pile like mountains,\nWhile the good heart lacks even a speck.\nWhen Old Yama arrives,\nIn an instant, none can stay.\nI urge you, cease your folly,\nSeek refuge in the Way.\nLeap from the pit of karmic fire,\nAbandon old paths trod.\nTurn the mysterious pass,\nAnd long life begins here.\n\n**To Daoist Friend Lun Boyu**\n\nOnce beneath Purple Peak,\nClouds and mist unfolded side by side.\nFrom the perilous pavilion, soft words flowed,\nMorning and night, weariness forgot.\nThe west wind cleared the dust from my robe,\nStaff and sandals followed in your wake.\nParting at Zhenyang, how desolate,\nEyes lingered as your steps slowed.\nAt the crossroads, we pledged Mount Crane,\nYet the current bore you—who could know?\nLike a ram’s horn twisting,\nEach move entangled in sorrow’s thread.\nThe southwest, a den of clouds and waters,\nSet my heart’s banner adrift.\nFortune and misfortune are heaven’s decree,\nMovement and stillness not of man’s design.\nYour intent straight as a plumb line,\nMy heart round as a compass.\nA thousand miles share the bright moon,\nNot a hair’s breadth between.\nSpirits fly to and fro,\nVague, without fixed time.\nRoaming the earth as one,\nHow could we bear even a moment’s parting?\nTreading the void, embracing emptiness,\nWhy doubt this floating flight?\nFrom this, the Three Perfected meet,\nEver in the presence of the sacred.\n\n**Dwelling in the Monastery**\n\nMen dwell, not the monastery—\nWhy debate success or failure?\nThe monastery dwells, not men—\nNo different from worldly bonds.\nFriends, clouds, and soaring halls,\nRegarded as grass and dust.\nExhausting sweat and blood,\nYet all ends in ruin.\nHow much better the true person,\nReciting word by word.\nMorning and night drinking jade dew,\nSilently attaining divine understanding.\nFloating beyond the six realms,\nSwiftly transcending the three worlds.\nOnce the moon-pearl of enlightenment dawns,\nWho would sell it in the mortal market?\nI come to dwell briefly,\nUnconcerned with spaciousness or confinement.\nI seek only cloud-and-mist friends,\nAs if repaying debts from past lives.\nAt peace amid the clamor,\nFame and profit cannot buy steadfastness.\nHeaven endows me with a cold, stern nature,\nYet I sit and let the vulgar stare.\nRising, I lament—\n\n**Solitude’s Difficulty**\n\nHow hard to be truly alone!\nHaughty disdain—how strange.\nSuffering this profound mystery’s malady,\nWho can cure its marrow-deep affliction?\nUnwilling to bind myself,\nHow could I offer fine cuts?\nA propitious wind stirs my spirit,\nStaff and sandals light and swift.\nNorth and south, east and west,\nI wander, learning to stride.\n\n**Secluded Dwelling**\n\nSeclusion delights the rustic heart,\nWorldly affairs left unattended.\nFriends drift apart and reunite,\nServants and children follow your lead.\nNeighbors like enemies,\nYears pass without a word.\nWorldly manners colder than ice,\nHuman feelings as bland as water.\nPatched quail-robe in close view,\nCoarse food, its savor forgot.\nUnfettered in all things,\nContentment alone suffices.\n\n**The Illusion of Form**\n\nThis body brings great suffering,\nForget the self—what cause for sorrow?\nThe form is most intimate,\nYet in the end, it becomes a mound of earth.\nHow much more the things beyond this body,\nAll illusory as the Tower of Nothingness.\nThe great earth labors to give life,\nYet all is fleeting, unfree.\nAll things are predestined,\nWho can seek beyond?\nThe web of doubt shatters itself—\nRest, rest, and rest again.\nDo not be a tool of emptiness,\nNor a prisoner of the real.\nWith a heart vast and at ease,\nRoam in harmony with transformation.\nIn life, do nothing,\nLet it be—do not cling.\nBreak free from the dusty chamber,\nWithin and without, untangled.\nOne day, the ancient moon of nature shines,\nRadiant as autumn’s clear sky.\n\n**Worldly Deceit**\n\nShutting the door, too lazy to go out,\nThe crowd’s judgment loses harmony.\nLeaning on a staff, I walk the streets,\nMy sharp eyes despise the drifting throng.\nThe whole town blames my errors,\nCutting ties, they scorn my deceit.\nHow hard it is to be human—\nEvery move invites slander.\nExamining myself, my heart is not yet ash,\nYet I feign madness as if truly deluded.\nWith a heart of ash, forgetting form,\nWho fears demons and obstacles?\nIn this bustling world,\nNothing lacks a fixed appearance.\nEach clings to their own bias,\nVoices aligning with their kind.\nThe earth is all red dust,\nFrom association, waves turn white.\nTasting the profound mystery’s flavor,\nSudden enlightenment reveals the true state.\nThe solitary moon of self-nature is round,\nThe heart’s expanse like the sky.\nLeaping beyond the gate of life and death,\nPiercing the treasury of light.\n\n**Leaving the Monastery**\n\nAt first, I vowed to guard my folly,\nMuddled, without clarity.\nLong stillness gave way to restlessness,\nMany mouths boasted and marveled.\nRotten meat draws flies,\nMerchandise seeks its price.\nAgain and again, I met with frustration,\nNo time to dance or rest.\nUnable to be without you,\nYet who among you is not false?\nThe hidden bird returns to its cage,\nThe white colt is harnessed.\nYu’s steps and cloud gatherings,\nAll are transformed by transformation.\nThe world delights in shock,\nHearing rumors, they clamor.\nPure admonition aids the real,\nWhy wish for others’ astonishment?\nThe wren soars in empty space,\nHow would the crow know fear?\nA thousand dusts met with a smile,\nCasually, I find respite.\nThe luminous truth above,\nEach pursues their own—none rely on others.\nEntering the realm of nothingness,\nEnjoyment sweet as inverted sugarcane.\nIn the end, what is it like?\nThe world hides within the world.\n\n**Dharma Body**\n\nThe wondrous Dharma Body of the profound mystery,\nAll things and self are fully endowed.\nA speck of dust contains worlds,\nIts vast measure embraces heaven and earth.\nGreat and small, myriad differences,\nYet their root is one and the same.\nLike the vast ocean,\nAll creatures share its bounty.\nAlas, those bound by emotion,\nAgain ensnared by form.\nSunk in the pit of birth and death,\nRevolving like fur and skin.\nDescending to the root, lost in kalpas,\nSuffering as if inverted.\nSages offer expedient means,\nRescuing without abandonment.\nYet how can the wise remain blind,\nFacing each other as in a dream?\nThe pot of heaven—\n\n**The Pot of Heaven**\n\nThe pot of heaven touches the human realm,\nFlawless, purely clear and cold.\nPalaces and pavilions lean on empty azure,\nTheir grandeur linked to the blue mountains.\nThe balmy wind comes from the south,\nInstantly banishing the Fire God’s heat.\nMaster Zhuang and Hui Shi,\nWielding dust whisks, discoursed on frost.\nAscending the Ripple-Viewing Tower,\nGazing down at the long, flowing stream.",

      "translated_text": "**In Praise of the Dao**\n\nVast and boundless, the divine radiance fills the Great Void,\nIts high and profound governance sets the primal beginning.\nIt embraces the cosmos, nothing lies beyond its reach,\nYet enters the finest hair-tip, its light ever abundant.\nAll phenomena revolve through creation and transformation,\nGrass emerges and vanishes by its breath.\nYet the natures of things permit no exchange of tidings—\nBeast and bird, plant and fish, each abides in its own way.\n\n**Celebrating Long Spring**\nMists unfurl, revealing a thousand mountains and ten thousand leagues of clear sky,\nThe celestial realm brims with spring, its qi overflowing.\nDewdrops glisten in flower hearts, free from worldly cares,\nWillow eyes open to the wind, untouched by mortal passions.\nThe young wander lost in boundless wastes,\nWhile old immortals gather, pledging Penglai and Yingzhou.\nSeated, we drain cups of jade-green wine, joy knows no end—\nDrunk, we ride cloud-chariots homeward, tipped and careening.\n\n**Begging for a Paper Quilt**\nThis form, upright as a hanging wart,\nSees through the original truth—all things come to rest.\nCall it ox or horse, it answers not;\nBid it seek fowl or hound, it knows no desire.\nA single gourd suffices for sustenance, life’s needs are met,\nA hundred patches clothe the body, the year’s provisions complete.\nYet still I beg a paper quilt from the lord’s gate—\nOn cold nights in my snail-shell hut, I sit wrapped to the head.\n\n**Having Long Wished to Make a Paper Quilt, Now at Last It Is Done**\nSoft and fine, layered like tender creek vines,\nSelf-made, its green silk lining fresh as new.\nBy day, it rolls up wild clouds, motionless in flight;\nBy night, it drapes the river moon, its light boundless.\nIts plain simplicity befits its purpose, far from vulgar craft,\nIts warmth, drawn from yang’s harmony, rivals spring’s embrace.\nOld age’s chills demand the aid of fire’s strength—\nOn a low bed by a withered desk, it companions my idle self.\n\n**Awakening from Delusion**\nPure essence once scattered, now thinned and dissipated,\nAdrift and lost, whither does one wander?\nWho governs seeing, hearing, eating, and rest?\nClinging without return, one wearies in vain.\nTo cast a Sui pearl at a sparrow—what folly!\nThe taker scorns it; the seeker prizes it.\nWhen shall one discern that self and ox are not two?\nWhite clouds are trodden, the imperial realm’s return.\n\n**Again**\nHoarding gold and silk invites one’s own blame,\nScattering tiles and pebbles averts no calamity.\nJade refines and polishes, grinding stones to dust;\nPearls emerge from night’s glow, split from the clam’s womb.\nTo hide oneself, one need not shun the deep and remote—\nExternal things are known to come of themselves.\nYet how can one trust this report?\nThe mystery’s gate and spear—how could they open?\n\n**Weary of Abbotship**\nLeaving home, one enters the Daoist’s household,\nExchanging worldly robes for the cold iron of the *khakkhara*.\nHaving awakened to illusion’s hues as no true form,\nHow can one bear, with ailing eyes, to recognize empty flowers?\nLess agile than the leopard of Southern Mountain,\nMore confined than the frog in the well—true poet indeed!\nBetter to lean on a staff for ten idle years,\nWandering waters and clouds, boundless in delight.\n\n**For Guo Ziyuan on His Northward Journey, Written in Tongzhou**\nThis parting marks the first stretch from Yan Mountain,\nThe icy waters of Dichen send you on your way.\nThe Daoist simplifies affairs, yet they multiply;\nFacing guests, he seems heartless, yet feels deeply.\nThe keyhole fits but holds the wedge—\nFrom here, the roc beats the wind, soaring on its journey.\nThe spirit roams the eight limits without end—\nWho knows when we shall meet again in Jade Capital?\n\n**Auspicious Snow**\nThe earth’s every fine detail, all things void,\nThe vast sky stretches endlessly, a single vast expanse.\nNight congeals, cold immerses the plum’s soul and moon;\nDawn brushes lightly, stirring the sash of wind.\nLife and world shift beyond the dust’s bounds,\nHeaven and earth are gathered into the jade pot.\nThe empty hall’s auspicious herbs merge with the jade forest,\nWeighing down Penglai’s foremost peak.\n\n**Sleeping**\nThe mountain of form lies toppled, eyelashes entwined,\nAt the ear’s edge, the world’s clamor rages unheeded.\nLost in profound oblivion, forgetting the master’s reproach,\nHow would it know the disciple’s scorn?\nWhat hinders the dream-fish from swimming the marshlands?\nNo harm in becoming a butterfly, flitting among flower branches.\nThat single spark of wakeful clarity—\nAll realms, all directions, nothing it does not embrace.\n\n**Mid-Autumn**\nThe dusty world cannot resolve its sorrows,\nSo hand in hand, we ascend the southern tower.\nWhat joy does the Daoist find at midnight?\nSitting in clarity, gazing upward, wandering inwardly.\nSuddenly, beyond heaven and earth, all is luminous and pure,\nThe great thousand worlds’ finest details gathered in.\nVast and free, self and things forgotten—\nThe true realm, true joy, endless.\n\n**The Moon Veils Its Light**\nAll sounds hush in autumn’s bold qi,\nWandering clouds thin, the sky stretches high.\nYu’s tower and Yuan’s isle offer no delight—\nLeaning on the oar, pausing the cup, gazing in vain.\nThe moon, round and bright, remains ever thus;\nWhen veiled by mist, its light is fittingly obscured.\nHuman life is but an inn for things—\nJoy and sorrow come and go, inescapable.\n\n**Dream and Awakening**\nNow they speak of last night’s dream,\nLast night’s dreamers now speak.\nSpeakers and dreamers—are they not all I?\nWhy then distinguish between waking and dreaming?\nAs a butterfly or a cicada, things transform—\nAs if pulling a nail or prying a wedge.\nA single thought turns the mechanism—dream and waking empty,\nSpiritual clarity pierces through kalpas of dust and sand.\n\n**A Rare Encounter**\nA meeting once in ten thousand ages, like dawn and dusk,\nA thousand leagues away, the worthy stand shoulder to shoulder.\nThe two luminaries flicker past like a galloping colt,\nThe parched earth’s weeds scatter like drifting catkins.\nAwareness and emotion briefly part, like cloud and mud,\nThoughts and cares just divide, entangling self and things.\nThrough the ages, right and wrong are all inverted—\nIn dreams, who has leisure to snatch at their own head?\n\n**Sitting Alone**\nAwakening from dreams—who is Zhou, who the butterfly?\nRiding a crane or girding gold—let none debate.\nEnduring neighbors: pine and stone,\nVast and bright friends: moon and cloud.\nCrows call, wind carries the celestial melody,\nMountain hues and stream lights reveal earth’s patterns.\nThe true realm, serene beyond worldly affairs—\nNo need to seek again the White Prime Lord.\n\n**Losing the Self**\nThe Daoist dwells where there is no dwelling,\nThe great function’s full mechanism meets all encounters.\nWith intent, one observes the face yet fails to meet—\nLosing the self, conduct and speech lose their way.\n*Chu ci* summons the soul, but the soul does not return,\nProfit and fame—best to keep them at a distance.\nThe floating yang, like sesame and millet, swirls—\nChasing the drum’s beat is no true mechanism.\n\n**Self-Reflection**\nThe numinous wind stirs the lofty—what constancy?\nReturning the light, every household preserves its radiance.\nBefore the formless cliff, lush auspicious grasses thrive,\nOn the unbudding branch, true fragrance lingers.\nFire-pears and flame-jujubes are no other things,\nMighty phoenixes and benevolent qilins bring their own blessings.\nThe golden key and jade lock open freely—\nWater and clouds, faintly recalling the land of water and clouds.\n\n**The Void’s Substitution**\nAnts and clams know not the snail’s retreat,\nThe locust altar’s emptiness invites frost’s encroachment.\nMountains and rivers show you the emptiness of rise and fall,\nSun and moon, east and west, endure from ancient times.\nGain and loss cease not, turning like a hand’s palm,\nRight and wrong have no fixed form, bound to love and hate.\nWho has eyes as vast as a cartwheel?\nAt a glance, all empty flowers sink into oblivion.",

What is the use of so much talk?\nShatter the knot of doubt, emulate the sealed bag.\n\n**Sealing the Mouth**\nFortunate to escape the dusty snares and worldly nets,\nYet pitiful to still be ensnared by the demons of sages and worthies.\nSo much still lingers in the heart’s chamber,\nVast and empty, it churns like waves on paper.\nHaving awakened, it is no different from the threefold sorrow,\nOnly then do I know there is yet a realm of nothingness.\nFrom now on, I shall curl my tongue and seal my mouth,\nPreserve qi, perfect spirit, and nurture the Great Harmony.\n\n**Assuming the False**\nA leather sack with two legs roams east and west—\nWho in the void could claim lordship?\nDriving the hundred bones through the nine orifices,\nSix ghosts arise, three worms grow.\nA mass of flesh and bone, illusory from the start,\nTen thousand mechanisms, utterly empty to the core.\nEven if the original true self remains,\nWhen admonished, the ears turn deaf as if struck.\n\n**The Mechanism of Transformation**\nThe mechanism of transformation renews itself moment by moment,\nIn the dream of the ant’s realm and the Jambu world, this body resides.\nRare to meet a friend who transcends life and death,\nWeary of hearing the clamor of those chasing fame and profit.\nIn Huayang, the idle beast returns unmet,\nIn the Qi era, the broken wheel is sent in vain.\nIllusory world, illusory body, illusory delusion—\nOnly the false can be, never the true.\n\n**Inheriting the Light**\nPassing the torch to continue the flame requires rekindling,\nThe elixir furnace’s embers gleam like ice.\nThe sea of awakening welcomes the new moon’s fullness,\nThe sky of nature again hosts auspicious clouds.\nWithin the pot, no idle flowers or grasses are sown,\nBeyond things, there is no old vine.\nThe supreme principle is attained from the true and real—\nDo not let heart and mouth fall out of accord.\n\n**Cultivation**\nWhere is cultivation most intimate?\nIn purity and non-action, attaining the original true.\nThe wondrous principle has been complete since the beginning,\nWhen illusory dust is swept away, the primordial chaos is restored.\nThe numinous root flourishes, manifesting in due time,\nThe great function fully reveals itself, renewed day by day.\nIf you seek attainment on one side,\nIn the end, it is but illusion, unrelated to the self.\n\n**Purifying the Heart**\nThe heart’s field—thorns and brambles cut away, leveled,\nFire-pears and flame-jujubes grow as twin trees.\nThe numinous thing is inherently whole, lacking nothing,\nEmpty flowers fade, clarity emerges of itself.\nLike a pearl, like a mirror—round and still,\nLike jade, like ice—pure and clear.\nDo not say the Profound Mystery cannot be transmitted—\nThe living mechanism appears to man in due time.\n\n**Non-Contention**",

fine night, clouds disperse and the moon shines white,\nIn this sagely age, seas are calm and rivers run clear.\nA perfect victory—dreaming of the land of Huaxu,\nNo need to debate time’s constraints in the mustard-seed city.\nPure contention is inherently unchanging, indestructible,\nThe precious pearl embraces the radiance of Great Light.\n\n*End of Scroll One of Cloud Mountain Collection*\n*Scroll Two of Cloud Mountain Collection—Seven-Character Regulated Verse*\n*Composed by Zhenren Ji Zhizhen, the Knower of the Constant*\n\n**Contentiousness**\nOn the mountain of self and others, each claims a peak,\nMyriad summits block the path, jagged as fangs.\nDust seals the ancient road, no way back,\nMist locks the numinous source, never reaching home.\nWho would bind the heart like a tethered tiger?\nOnly those who glare like croaking frogs.\nA single hair’s touch sparks the heart’s warfare,\nLeaving corpses strewn like hemp in chaos.\n\n**Following the Current**\nDrifting along the stream, sitting upright on a starry raft,\nAwakening to the numinous source—this is home.\nScriptures and verse-satchels, idle playthings,\nThe medicine furnace and elixir tripod, an old man’s livelihood.\nThe Daoist of Clear Stream invites the bright moon,\nThe Master of White Stone reclines in emerald haze.\nFace to face, the three beneficial friends forget all,\nOne scroll of autumn waters, one cup of tea.\n\n**Dwelling in the Mountains**\nA towering boulder serves as a precious seat,\nSoft moss in abundance replaces green felt.\nCloud cliffs and moonlit grottoes array their secluded wonders,\nWind spirits and mountain deities aid the Dharma feast.\nStream waters and lush forests all expound the Dao,\nWildflowers and flying birds all penetrate the Mystery.\nIn an instant, one reaches the realm of Nothing-Whatsoever,\nNo need for words—all are immortals.\n\n**Vulgar Customs**\nWhose chickens and dogs roam freely, knowing their quest?\nA stubborn heart refuses to be reined in.\nThe ear-moon is enslaved by sound and form,\nThe bodily frame is ever a prisoner of profit and fame.\nLike woodcutters, they fight over a deer’s share,\nToo lazy to follow the butcher’s art of dismembering oxen.\nRight and wrong are inverted without pause,\nThe cycle of birth and death—when will it end?\n\n**Probing the Mystery**\nChewing through the profound mystery, all things are real,\nGolden flowers emerge from water, pure and dustless.\nThe scenery of the celestial pot changes moment to moment,\nThe clouds and rosy mists of grotto-heavens renew every instant.\nKarmic conditions and transformations are but illusory forms,\nThe message of the primordial beginning communicates with the divine.\nThe grasses and trees of the forest make no distinctions—\nOnly the true person among men is genuine.\n\n**Lost at Home**\nWeak and adrift, the path grows ever more errant,\nLike a cicada molting, one never returns home through the ages.\nSandalwood and locust—this fleeting life is like crawling maggots,\nThe battles of the ant clans in Jambudvīpa are like snail wars.\nSound and form cling, thick as honey,\nRight and wrong churn, tangled as hemp.\nWho can rouse the soaring ambition to transcend the heavens,\nLeaping from the sea of delusion onto the moonlit raft?\n\n**Walking Alone**\nBreaking through the profound mystery, gaining freedom to gather and release,\nEvery hair and brow soars through the heavens.\nForgotten beyond the world, seeking neither chickens nor dogs,\nYet obediently answering to the calls of horses and oxen.\nWielding the axe with skill, never striking the nose,\nUnmoved by emotion, even when rice is scattered before him.\nOn a vast night of white moon and clear wind,\nA single leaf of a boat drifts upon rivers and seas.\n\n**Savoring the Real**\nPure contention, non-action—the body of the wondrous mystery,\nA single hair’s rise defiles the heart’s field.\nRaising the brows brings a flurry of affairs,\nOpening the mouth clearly falls into duality.\nThose who sit like blocks of wood are equally burdened,\nHow many are entangled by kudzu vines?\nGathering heads to put on airs—what is the point?\nSeeing through it all, none of it is worth a penny.\n\n**The Dullness of Form**\nFrom the primordial beginning, cast into this prison of form,\nEndlessly toiling, never a moment’s rest.\nPlaying with bones and sinews, displaying strength,\nTossing dust about, hawking from what tower?\nAmid the thicket of right and wrong, ever opening the mouth,\nBefore the mountain of self and others, ever thrusting the head forward.\nOnly when the nose’s breath can no longer be blown,\nWill the skull rest content in the desolate mound.\n\n**Toilsome Life**\nSuperfluous growths and dangling warts—great afflictions of the body,\nFrom the start, mistakenly taken as real.\nPoverty presses urgently, no respite,\nWealth and honor demand ceaseless scheming.\nIn the arena of fame and profit, one adds vigor,\nOn the path of private deceit, one expends spirit.\nIn the end, what does it all become?\nHow bitterly you are toyed with at the crucial moment!\n\n**Heterodox Views**\nBaiting the hook to lure the leviathan—never seen it work,\nYet time and again, they swallow the hook like fledgling birds.\nLike duckweed on water, content to drift,\nLike falling catkins, easily swayed by the wind.\nEyes diseased, they mistake the real for the false,\nMinds deranged, they turn goodness into demons.\nLong-held delusions are hard to reverse,\nEven those who return may aid the overgrown sprouts.\n\n**True Virtue**\nThe moment a thought arises, ghosts and spirits know,\nThe original good heart cannot be deceived.\nAiding beings and benefiting life, forgetting gain and loss,\nYielding to others, acting with humility.\nPrivate deceit and arrogance are routinely dispelled,\nLoyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and compassion rise and descend.\nReverent, sincere, without flattery or crookedness,\nWhere in heaven and earth would one not be fitting?\n\n**Worldly Entanglements**\nEngaging in debates, distinguishing east and west—what merit is there?\nThis heart cannot align with worldly sentiments.\nJade-like nectar speaks of stillness, yet none understand,\nMuddy wine and clamor create their own thickets.\nAdornments attract flies to swarm,\nThe empty boat, loosely moored, drifts on boundless waters.\nOrchids and angelicas remain unruffled, unseen by others,\nYet their pure fragrance still brushes the evening breeze.\n\n**Self-Concealment**\nLetting all matters rest, feigning foolishness,\nUtmost sincerity alone accords with the Dao.\nThe precious pearl of the mystery must be sealed tightly,\nRare herbs and jade flowers bloom late.\nThe elixir is refined, yet none recognize it,\nWhere the talisman flies, even ghosts cannot spy.\nThe Dharma-body merges with the realm of empty space,\nIts wondrous function is clear—no doubt remains.\n\n**Imitative Dharma**\nErecting images to clarify the real only obscures it,\nDim and dull eyes add more dust.\nFrom this, paintings and carvings veil the mystery,\nWhen will clay and wood reveal the Dharma-body?\nIllusions arise from conditions, deceiving the world,\nCunning devices secretly ensnare people.\nTalking of gods and ghosts—errors fill the heavens,\nUnafraid of Yama, the Lord of the Underworld, beware!\n\n**Doctrinal Nets**\nEntering the gate, one wears an iron bridle,\nLed here and there, never free.\nRestrained solely by our teachings and precepts,\nSealed off, not permitted to seek beyond.\nHeaven is but a vain hope, a lure for blessings,\nHell a hollow threat, a tale of woe.\nOver time, one becomes a ghostly exemplar,\nBewitched by demons and delusions until death.\n\n**Chasing the Times**\nThe gates of the powerful are like the sea, I am but a fish,\nBehind each high curtain, I hasten to follow.\nMouths mumble, hearts constrict,\nBodies crane their necks, feet tiptoe.\nEsteeming the Dao and honoring virtue—this is delusion,\nThe net of vulgar customs and worldly dust is the true snare.\nOriginally abandoning home—what was the aim?\nReflecting, all efforts were utterly misguided.",

grasping, envy, greed, and self-interest,\nHeedless of peril, all is pursued.\nStrength wanes, influence fades—no proof remains,\nDisaster strikes, misfortune arises—no control.\nInvoking spirits, dancing shamans,\nConsulting talismans, befriending healers.\nIncense burns, a fleeting show of piety,\nYet the whole household follows blindly.\n\n**Intoxicated Heart**\nThe Daoist drinks the elixir’s sweet spring,\nNot the yellow wine that drowns in folly.\nNot the Six Classics’ profound depths,\nBut the Three Essentials’ mystery of mysteries.\nFame’s hook darts—fish swallow the bait,\nProfit lures east and west, craving rank stench.\nDrunk on ten thousand hues, all forgotten—\nOnly the lone moon ascends the jade sky.\n\n**Utter Poverty**\nBrilliance dimmed, the nature’s heaven lies bare,\nEons of dust and passion—all dissected.\nFrom this, the body stands naked, bones exposed,\nNo longer ensnared by illusions’ tangled roots.\nThe cowherd sees not where the man has gone,\nThe ground is utterly empty—even a cone finds no place.\nPoverty pushed to its utmost, poverty ceases—\nThe living impulse released: is it not I?\n\n**Following the True**\nLong have habits bound, greed run rampant,\nThe heart’s turmoil—endless suffering.\nThe true command issues, falsehoods flee,\nA glimmer of real work—Dao may be grasped.\nLifetimes of knowing the thief, yet wandering north,\nKalpas of lost directions, minds pointing south.\nLife after life, chewing bitter coptis,\nYet the first taste of milk-sugar brings sweetness.\n\n**True Practice**\nBegin with humility, ever more humble,\nA level heart, one’s duty—naturally pure.\nAiding others, meeting all with kindness, no lapse,\nHarmonizing principle, illuminating truth—both embraced.\nLet no illusions or sorcery startle the world,\nNo strange tricks deceive the ears of the crowd.\nDeeply accumulate virtue and deeds—\nThe highest mechanism needs no grasping.\n\n**True Work**\nSeek not Southern Peak or Heavenly Terrace,\nEmpty names and forms—all dismissed.\nWealth and desire forgotten, the heart steadies,\nRight and wrong dissolved, the nature’s heaven opens.\nSincerity and stillness—action without question,\nImpartiality and compassion—virtue complete.\nOuter conduct and inner work both cultivated,\nThe radiant, perfect Lotus Throne attained.\n\n**Liu Fu’s Daughter’s Grief**\nCreation, heartless, toys with us,\nLaughter turns to grief unnoticed.\nThe Flower Keeper conjures a perfect beauty,\nBrewing a decade’s joyous dream.\nThe dream shatters—emptiness alone remains,\nYet all efforts are spent adorning the fair one’s departure.\nThreads snap, echoes fade—each returns home,\nA life left dangling in a hollow deception.\n\n**Dissolving into Emptiness**\nCreation’s tricks—none recognize,\nIts shifting wonders—who truly knows?\nLightning-fast mechanisms, impossible to guard,\nThe dark path ahead—black as lacquer.\nA hand’s turn—life and death, rise and fall,\nMorning four, evening three—sevenfold inversion.\nJoy and sorrow arise unbidden—\nA mass of illusion mistaken for reality.\n\n**Wind and Waves**\nWind and waves stir easily, grudges and favors,\nIngrained habits hard to forget—brewing joy and sorrow.\nThrough the ages, right and wrong never cease,\nA lifetime of self and others—endless strife.\nHeroes ensnared by fame and achievement,\nHeroes imprisoned by profit and desire.\nThe great cause and conditions—unheeded,\nAll day, fretting for others.\n\n**Establishing Transformation**\nOriginal truth is not form, form is not truth,\nThe gate of transformation—all dust.\nIn dust, who can open the true path?\nAmid things, who reveals the whole self?\nUnbinding the withered, loosening bonds—few,\nTranscending the common, surpassing the crowd—how many?\nKnowing one’s practice is not of great capacity,\nBest to remain still and nurture the spirit.\n\n**Residing in the Monastery**\nEndless clamor of greetings and farewells,\nHuman affairs—exhausting restraint.\nDisciples shoulder burdens, iron willow baskets,\nThe monastery’s gate—a stylish prison.\nA single lapse in vigilance—heart turns vulgar,\nGathering clods, bathing in mud.\nAshamed, the west wind blows with force,\nScattered clouds drift, clinging to cliffs and valleys.\n\n**Discussing Scriptures**\nProbing scriptures as a ladder to heaven,\nPlucking yellow leaves to quiet a child’s cry.\nAfter rain, lotuses rise from water,\nIn wind, willow fluff clings to mud—how joyful!\nHow can a mole aspire to chariots and horses?\nHas the roc ever delighted in drums and gongs?\nVulgar songs of the lowlands become custom,\nYet singing the *Yangchun* only deepens doubt.\n\n**Self-Bondage**\nBorn, yet unaware of emptiness,\nSpears and halberds grind, filling the chest.\nNot the sea’s depths plumbed to the bottom,\nNor the mountain’s peaks scaled to their heights.\nDelusion’s rope binds—three thousand coils,\nDharma’s net imprisons—ten thousand layers.\nLonging to escape the cave of birth and death,\nWho would follow an old man’s lead?\n\n**Dharma Forms**\nGrandiose dharma forms spread wide,\nAll alike—lost sheep, valleys and storehouses.",

A stubborn nature loves to seek the mountains,\nYet upon reaching them, one recalls the return.\nBowing and rising on slopes, the burden heavy,\nStruggling up steep steps, weary of the climb.\nBears and hungry tigers lurk nearby,\nWoodcutters and hunters knock at dusk’s gate.\nHow much better to stand firm as jade, the mind settled,\nUpright and at ease, wherever one may be.\n\n**Wandering Immortals in the Human World**\nTrusting one’s steps, climbing to gather the true,\nFollowing the traces of Gonghe, neighbor to Crane Mountain.\nThe land of the Dao belongs to cloud and mist,\nThis remote place knows no dust of carriages and horses.\nBeneath the rocks, a sacred spring, cold moon’s reflection,\nBefore the hall, ancient cypresses, spring’s hidden glow.\nThe thatched hut calls the mountain boy—ask him:\n“Is there still one who summons the wind with a long whistle?”\n\n**Visiting the Five Peaks**\nFive peaks stand like walls, arrayed in mountain faces,\nCave palaces deep, encircled by layered verdure.\nCanopies stretch wide, the Jade Chamber hangs,\nStone gates, secluded, lead to the mysterious pass.\nThings pass through kalpas—where have the people gone?\nPeople depart to court the origin—cranes have not returned.\nThe noble conduct once heard—only traces remain,\nA sky of bright moon, the Whistling Terrace at ease.\n\n**Laying Down the Hook**\nWhite duckweed, red reeds—how many autumns?\nHungry golden carp never rise to the hook.\nCloud-bait, arrow-sack—vainly kept secret,\nThe rainbow rod put away, best to rest.\nLi Zhu’s eyes fail to measure, gazing south,\nMad Qu’s words falter, knowing the northern journey.\nA thousand fathoms of surging waves, the vast sea,\nA sky of bright moon, one empty boat.\n\n**Auspicious Signs on a Warm Day**\nThe courtyard’s morning brings fine auspices,\nFortune and longevity silently added to your house.\nThe illusory world of men—recognized in time,\nThe true wind beyond things—praised this day.\nThe jade flask of life-preservation gathers crimson snow,\nThe golden crucible of longevity refines cinnabar.\nWilling to come and drink on the Dark Continent,\nSitting to watch the peach blossoms bloom again and again.\n\n**A Chance Encounter**\nAwakening from dull, drowsy meditation,\nA wine-fly shatters the sky within the jar.\nBoundless realms, so vast,\nThe great liberation’s mechanism—wondrous, untransmitted.\nBy water, near mountains—new undertakings,\nFavorable winds, bright moon—old causes green.\nBefore one’s eyes, grasses and trees all speak the principle,\nCrickets’ autumn chirps—night’s discourse on the profound.\n\n**Self-Reproach**\nCreation clearly toys with this skin-sack,\nYet still I cling to the arena of profit and fame.\nIn later years, unrestrained chatter,\nGood flesh idly carved, self-inflicted wounds.\nBeneficial friends meet and part, spewing joy and sorrow,\nThis illusory body moves and stops—a dream’s drifting.\nThe world’s itches and disturbances make peace impossible,\nI recall the deep hiding place among white clouds.\n\n**Double Ninth on Jade Flower Isle**\nOn the ninth day of the ninth month in Yan Mountain, meeting friends,\nStaff and sandals wander Jade Flower Isle.\nOvergrown paths, marked branches, threading ancient caves,\nPrecipices, leaning on rocks, gazing toward the divine continent.\nAncient pines, old wutong trees—desolate in the sun,\nRed leaves, yellow flowers—subtle autumn’s glow.\nOne matter untroubled, deep interest spent,\nTurning to seek the return path, oars of a light boat.\n\n**Farewell to Elder Jinpo**\nParting words in haste, ice and snow cold,\nLike horses turning their heads toward Western Mountain.\nIn the basket, talismans and registers just transmitted,\nIn the sleeves, Kun and Wu—how could they be idle?\nJust like last year’s departure from the palace,\nAgain today, arriving among men.\nAffectionate ties resolved, heart’s matters settled,\nSeizing the east wind, reverently approaching the imperial gate.\n\n**Seeing Zhang Wenshu Off to Helin**\nGovernance is the great way of heaven’s thoroughfare,\nSun slow, wind warm, horses’ hooves light.\nNorthward journey to the Dark Waters, messages flow,\nGreen mountains arrayed, ready to send and welcome.\nI too delve into obscure searches, exhausting the mouse’s stratagems,\nYou should exert strength, soaring like Peng’s flight.\nHelin is a footstep from the Son of Heaven’s majesty,\nTogether we look up to the grace shining on the Jade Capital.\n\n**Same as Above**\nOld age brings deep reluctance at parting,\nUnworthy, I still compose a farewell poem.\nDay clear, wind passes, flowers fly in the sun,\nSpring slow, mud softens, swallows speak in verse.\nAfter parting, unbearable to dwell on past wrongs,\nGazing, helpless—soon lost in folly.\nEvening clouds, misty waves—each stage distant,\nTurning back to seek vows—who can know?\n\n**Seeing He Juchuan Off with the Perfected One to Court**\nCrane’s carriage, light and swift, rising from Yan,\nRiding the wind straight up to the Hooked Heaven.\nDragon mounds, desert sands—thousands of miles,\nSouthward plum blossoms, northward journey—half a year.\nAfter parting, who will share a laugh?\nIn this seat, with whom to speak of the profound?\nA lifetime of iron and stone, the liver and bowels break,\nOld eyes meet—tears nearly fall.\n\n**Same as Above**\nYou meet a transcendent, study like Lu Ao,\nOne leap, soaring clouds—ten thousand fathoms high.",

immortals.\nYour dark merit, vast and subtle, bridges the hidden and the earthly,\nYour great shelter’s ripples reach even the old gluttons.\nUseless if you fail to aid the world—what worth then?\nYet fit to retire to the groves, drunk on peaches of immortality.\n\n**Musing on the Northern Palace**\n\nLeaning on a blossom-staff, I pace slowly through the palace grounds,\nThe great transformation’s tide has swept all into the void.\nGrass and trees now drink fresh rain and dew,\nPavilions and terraces bear no trace of old cinnabar hues.\nJade steps lie shattered, only remnants of footprints remain,\nThe marble stairs stand ruined, yet the ancient statutes endure.\nWaterbirds, unaware the world has changed,\nStill gather at dusk on the sandy shoals.\n\n**Autumn Excursion to Jade-Flower Isle**\n\nHigh in the Palace of Broad Cold, wildflowers bloom yellow,\nThorns and brambles choke the ancient grotto chambers.\nScattered stones and crumbling walls mark a new realm,\nWithered lotus and withered grass fill the old ponds.\nWhere now the floating clouds of caps and canopies?\nLightning-swift, the mountain boats vanish without trace.\nI turn to the west wind to ask for news—\nOnly the sky-piercing pines stand ever green.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nOn this new autumn, immortals join to seek their pact,\nWind-borne carriages descend lightly from the Great Purity.\nHundred-jeweled dew bathes the moon’s cavern,\nNine-rayed clouds veil the glimpse of Penglai’s isles.\nLooking down, the azure vault unfurls like brocade,\nUpside-down, jade flowers mirror the crystal waters.\nStriding through the Palace of Broad Cold, idly I survey—\nHow many tread the edges of the Jade Empyrean?\n\n**Recalling the Former Palace**\n\nLayered timbers, clouds massed—Jian Zhang’s halls rise,\nA long march of captives, yet the golden ramparts stood firm.\nFermented into the force of tribal strife and whale-like conquest,\nTransformed into the battleground of sandalwood and silk.\nOne night’s palace flames left only embers,\nA hundred years of men now lie in frozen waste.\nI ponder the clamor of those days of splendor—\nWho would believe the west wind leaves the grass unyellowed?\n\n**Western Flower Garden**\n\nThe imperial carriage’s dust settled, never to disperse,\nThe five-cloud towers and pavilions all turned to ash.\nOnce, the great enterprise shone a thousand fathoms bright,\nNow, a hollow name—just a cup of wine.\nThe Maker’s mechanisms play their tricks,\nThe sun-birds race dawn and dusk in vain.\nDo the garden’s flowers and grasses still know?\nThe east wind has been moved to plant elsewhere.\n\n**Lamenting Yanran’s Past**\n\nGold, like a lost deer, fled the Central Plains,\nUnnoticed, the ashes flew from the Five Phoenix Tower.\nThe palace’s halls and guards became wild grass,\nCourtiers and scholars all turned to mounds of sand.\nDrums and war horns shattered the dream of Hua Xu,\nClouds and waters first promised a boundless journey.\nNow I watch the west wind’s gentle withering—\nHow many autumns have passed since the red reeds bloomed?\n\n**Mourning Lecturer Hao**\n\nI recall our talks by the Zhang River’s banks,\nHow grand—now you have returned to your true nature.\nDiscarding your feathered robe, you first shed the old,\nThe bright crow soars into empty space, parting to renew.\nDreaming of pacing the Dipper, you wake at dusk in the dusty world,\nTreading clouds, you return to the Emperor’s realm in spring.\nThe jade censer’s yellow threads melt into ash,\nLeaving only pure fragrance for those who come after.\n\n**Staying at Five-Flower Mountain**\n\nTrue immortals have rebuilt Five-Flower Palace,\nThe mountain’s face, lush and winding, cradles brocade peaks.\nClear springs murmur through the quiet night,\nSlender bamboos rustle in the crisp wind.\nThe land is remote, the scene secluded—all surpasses the hidden,\nHuman skill and heaven’s work achieve wondrous craft.\nI ask where the elixir is refined—\nOnly the mountain’s towering trees, bathed in evening red.\n\n**True Nature**\n\nTo conjecture or describe is already to lose the truth,\nThe moment it passes the lips, it falls into the dust of roots.\nFrom one source it first arises, yet in every head it is,\nThrough six gates its light divides, ever renewed each instant.\nRound and responsive, the pivot’s wheel—all creation’s mystery,\nStir past the barrier’s bolt, and you yourself become divine.\nHow many illusions have been made into servants?\nWho remains the original master?\n\n**A Guest Shows a Brocade Bag Holding a Phoenix Beak**\n\nScarcely emerged from the cinnabar mountain, its virtue already wanes,\nHow much more the lingering taste, recalling its woven nest.\nIts five-colored plumage, once heralded—now but an empty tale,\nIts nine-fold spirit—where does it reside?\nThe great tortoise’s shell was split, yet not for its own glory,\nThe unicorn’s leg was broken—how did it come to this?\nThe four sacred creatures are no common things,\nYet even they are swept up in the kalpa’s ashes.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nThe living mechanism transmitted, years forgotten,\nNow I see the Way of heaven and earth both complete.\nStanding firm, our lineage surpasses ten thousand ages,\nRound and harmonious, it encompasses the three mysteries.\nVastly it opens the treasure store, free of restraint,\nSecretly it aligns the pivot’s wheel, brushing away bias.\nIt draws the Silver River to roof the heavens,\nAuspicious light flashes, guarding Yanran forever.\n\n**Seeing Off the Imperial Censor to Court**\n\nFrom childhood, you bore the grace of the imperial house,\nTo mend one flaw—why fear the melon’s swift succession?\nSteady, you soar through the crimson empyrean on a roc,\nFar, you sit astride the Silver River’s arc.\nOne day, the golden urn will bear the yellow roof’s name,\nAt the jade steps, in this fine hour, white hemp will be offered.\nAll admire the breath that revives the warming winds,\nA sky of spring colors spreads over the river’s sands.\n\n**Offering Longevity to the Perfected One of Pure Harmony**\n\nHolding the sun, you open the heavens, descending to the Jade Capital,\nA pillar of the Dao’s gate, hero of seas and mountains.\nThree thousand cycles of sixty years—you emerge in the world,\nNinety thousand immortals pledge their pact beyond the bounds.\nYour life-root stands firm as pine turned to stone,\nYour years outstrip mustard seeds filling a city.\nYour true form endures through the kalpa’s vastness,\nSeated, you watch the Yellow River’s currents clear time and again.\n\n**Celebrating the Ninth of September, Master Yan Zhan**\n\nIn plain sandals, you walk with Maid Ma and the Queen Mother,\nBy chance riding the wind’s carriage to descend to the Central Land.\nThe peaches of immortality you freely share with Dongfang Shuo,\nThe fire dates you personally transmit to Xu You’s wanderings.\nFragrant mists and cloud-harmonies fill the pure chamber,\nJade mushrooms and divine herbs grace the banquet of the spirit isles.\nIn Penglai’s shallow waters, idly you converse and laugh—\nHow many autumns have passed with red leaves and yellow flowers?\n\n**Seeing Off Lecturer Jia to Dongping**\n\nWrapped in the fragrance of water caltrop and lotus, I send you on your way,\nYour joyful countenance cupped, you depart the Phoenix City.\nThe warm sun steams, hastening your return,\nThe balmy wind stirs, your coral robe light.\nStartled awake from a three-year dream of your homeland,\nYou count the twelve stages of your journey.\nAfter parting, east and west, south and north—where will you wander?\nWhen will we meet again to speak of the classics?\n\n**Matching Yang Xi’an’s Rhymes**\n\nThe cloud-shouldered gates of the grotto palace remain unopened,\nScattered red rain—spring’s end is near.\nJust as the valleys and peaks recover from the breath’s force,\nAgain the river and sky turn to sleet and snow’s chill.\nThe wind carries a wrecked boat to the land of ghosts,\nMen follow the white donkey to Huai’an’s dream.\nEver has the Maker played like a child—\nBest to set it aside, forget, and sigh no more.\n\n**Same as Above**\n\nDarkly I search heaven’s principles, penetrating the subtle,\nWorldly affairs, tangled, yet their patterns are easily seen.\nFreshly bathed, you shake your robes—all must be taken,\nImpatient striving, plucking the zither—only invites ridicule.\nAt the right time, seize the gap—evil encroaches on the upright,\nIn creation, scales and fins may yet be made right or wrong.\nIf only the spirit’s heart could establish the imperial standard,\nThen use what is fitting to mend decay, and what is proper to return.",

      "translated_text": "**Seeing Off Peng Zongdao on His Journey North to Study with a Master**\nThis parting—how can I bear the sorrow welling thick?\nYou meet a transcendent like Lu Ao, seeking the Way.\nThe crane, ever mindful, cries out through the hours,\nWhile clouds, heartless, rise ever higher in their course.\nTo reach far, doubt not—let the steed stretch its stride;\nTo cleave the ox, fear not—the blade’s edge shines keen.\nThe master relies on you as hook and line,\nTo cast upon the ocean’s isles and land the giant turtle.\n\n**Seeing Off Cui Tingyu to Court**\nBamboo and moon, pine and wind—years of companionship,\nNow parting in misting plum rains by Yanran’s frontier.\nDistant mountains inspire you to idly craft verses,\nWhile desert sands, empty of men, urge the whip on.\nEarly you mapped great deeds by the Red Waters,\nNever lose the old family legacy of the blue felt mat.\nWhen the time comes, ascend the Hall of Brightness,\nRide the phoenix, grasp the unicorn, and ascend to heaven.\n\n**Seeing Off Zhao Zizhen, Presenting the Canon to Court**\nI recall our wanderings by Golden Phoenix Terrace,\nGazing from on high, thoughts stretching far and long.\nNow we meet again to part by Yan Mountain,\nUnexpectedly, the post-horse hurries the farewell.\nThe sacred canon’s mystic radiance ascends to heaven,\nWhile frontier dust and autumn hues touch my temples.\nThe homeward date is set—our year-long pact holds:\nLet not the cinnabar heart turn to a single inch of ash.\n\n**Mourning Guo Chaoran**\nThe precious canon’s copies all proved false,\nScattered pages, broken slips—now cloaked in dust.\nStartled awake, his noble bearing lingers in memory,\nThe dream shattered, his spirit’s visage made new.\nToo late, the parrot’s wing fades into twilight’s realm,\nSteadily rides the spirit-steed to the imperial spring.\nAlas, he reaches the Hall of Brightness,\nYet cares not that tears soak my kerchief.\n\n**Seeing Off Master Wang to Court**\nMending heaven, you draw near the Jasper Palace,\nTurning the Silver River back—your merit unique.\nThe crane brings golden missives from the purple courts,\nClouds merge in hues to reveal the azure vault.\nYour benevolent influence spreads, reviving the withered,\nThe stirring winds of kindness dispel all obscurity.\nAuspicious signs must be proclaimed in heaven’s realm,\nAs we watch the roc’s wings once more take the wind.\n\n**Inscribed on the Immortal’s Terrace, at the Tomb of the Man Who Lived While Dead**\nThe numinous spring’s deep draughts dissolve my lineage’s bonds,\nThrough kalpas, master and truth share the same face.\nDrunken eyes suddenly open—the world grows narrow,\nDream-souls awaken to find sea and mountains void.\nGold and jade gleam, flowers vie in bloom,\nPearls and gems cluster like trees in groves.\nI ask the eternal intent of Zhongnan’s peaks—\nA hundred rivers, silent, flow eastward as one.\n\n**Seeing Off Attendant Pan to Yongle**\nThe immortal lord emerges from the Five Bright Halls,\nJade pendants chiming in the wind of imperial guards.\nTriple-pure clouds steam white above his head,\nNine-returned elixir binds crimson to his cheeks.\nThe Great Clarity’s esoteric will—our master’s intent—\nNow carries on Lü’s ancestral work.\nI envision the moon above Zhongtiao’s peaks,\nIts auspicious light suffusing ten thousand homes as one.\n\n**Seeing Off Li Hefu Returning to Qin**\nYou depart west from Phoenix City,\nLotus robes billowing in the wind, feathered garb light.\nA hut of reeds holds heaven and earth in a single heart,\nWhile a hand’s span of clouds and mountains spans a thousand li.\nFortunate to have met, to know your face,\nGrievous to part again, our simple bond deep.\nThe ancestral intent of Zhongnan—you alone grasp it,\nWalking alone upon the road to Chang’an.\n\n**Seeing Off Du Tianfu Returning to Zhongnan**\nIn haste we speak our farewells, thoughts drifting,\nVast the cloud-wrapped mountains, long the road ahead.\nYour heart bound to the ancestral court, scorching heat forgotten,\nYour steps follow the official willows as the frost thins.\nIn prosperous times, strive with all your might,\nWhile I, old and indifferent, withdraw in stillness.\nRemember the day we parted by the jade hall,\nEvening winds lightly stirring the lotus blossoms.\n\n**Mourning Feng Quanxiao**\nBy the literary grove’s edge, you probed the subtle,\nTurning back to the world of men, you saw the dream was false.\nThe morning dwelling held not your true face,\nYet the living mechanism was ever yours to wield.\nA pair of cranes vanished beyond the white clouds,\nNo short flute now summons the yellow crane home.\nDesolate, the old flowers and trees before the tower,\nWest winds mingle with dew, weeping in the dawn’s glow.\n\n**Seeing Off He Juchuan to the Ancestral Court**\nEmpty mountains, ceaseless waters flowing,\nCranes lament, gibbons cry—how many years have passed?\nYesterday by the altar, you stood among the egrets’ ranks,\nNow in Qin and Long, you claim the turtle’s head.\nBefore your horse, wind and moon stretch endlessly,\nBeneath the crows, passes and rivers mark each autumn.\nOnce you grasp the single net that spans ten thousand moons,\nLightly ply the living mechanism and return home early.\n\n**Master Zifeng Journeys South**\nHeaven and earth seen through as a single lotus hut,\nShifting, never abiding, roaming the great void.\nTouching things, dark or bright, he mirrors their shadows,\nAmong men, bending or rising, he sways like a swing.\nThe vast ford’s boundless waves bear the mercy-boat,\nThe ancient way’s rugged path turns the virtue-chariot.\nHow many follow, gaping in his wake,\nAs he races beyond the dust to Huaxu’s realm.\n\n**Same as Above**\nThe master first grasped the truth within,\nOnce host of Purple Canopy Peak.\nHis breath summons the single wind that names all sounds,\nThe solitary moon’s perfect clarity illumines every ford.\nNorthward, he gazes toward Yan and Ji, where light and dust merge,\nSouthward, he crosses Liang’s gardens, where grasses and trees renew.\nWherever he goes, no need to blow the warming airs—\nWith ease, the cold valleys bloom again in spring.\n\n**Laozi Crossing the Pass**\nHoary head, youthful face—a body of transformation,\nThe blue ox’s faint hoofprints tread the yellow dust.\nMoonlight sings over Tianzhu’s streams and mountains at dawn,\nWind sweeps Hangu Pass, renewing grasses and trees.\nStraddling past and present, he rides the sun’s chariot,\nEntering non-being, emerging from being, he turns the wind’s wheel.\nTo fathom the wondrous, cast off names and forms—\nNo brush or ink may capture him for men.\n\n**Mourning Zhang Wenshu, Returning to Truth in the Forest**\nThe living-fire elixir crucible—his plan came too late,\nWind and clouds idly set aside, no more chanting of poems.\nBreaking through the eight poles, his spirit roamed the day,\nPiercing the three lives, his dream ended then.\n*Chu ci*’s summoning of souls—mere empty words,\n*Yue*’s lament for the past—what use is it now?\nOnly his rotting bones remain beneath the cold forest,\nAs spring departs and autumn returns, my heart aches with sorrow.\n\n**Seeing Off Master Zuo to Court**\nA descendant of Yuanfang through generations,\nFor years he paced with measured steps to the golden gate.\nJust heard the wind’s truth depart the celestial courts,\nNow word comes of the starry audience at the imperial throne.\nBy fate, he aids lords who seek Ji’s teachings,\nWith power, he calls forth spirits like Liu Gen.\nThe mountain-burning talismans are ready for use at any time,\nTo aid the upright and expel evil—look to the supreme one.\n\n**Farewell to Master Zhao Bound for Court**\nThe post road’s ice and snow stretch long and far,\nParting words hurried over a single cup of wine.\nThe basket holds feathered talismans, their might ablaze,\nThe casket guards the spirit-sword, its light flashing.\nSweeping away the mists from the altar, he serves the king,\nDriving wind and thunder, he reaches the imperial realm.\nSoon we’ll see him blow the mountain ghosts into submission,\nNo more will they wander, lost and hesitant.\n\n**Mourning Vice Minister Jia of the Celestial Prefecture**\n*(Fragment incomplete—no translation provided.)*",

      "translated_text": "**Holding the Reins of Governance**\n\nFirmly grasping the handle of transformation’s mechanism,\nScattered clouds drift—when will the imperial realm’s summons arrive?\nIn the pillow’s dream, the rooster crows thrice before waking,\nWithin the scholar-tree’s shade, millet cooks once to completion.\nThe illusory realm, though wearying, is not without its charms,\nOld robes exchanged—what sorrow could there be?\nBehold the waxing and waning moon o’er the golden terrace,\nIts night-cleansing radiance as bright as before.\n\n**Farewell to Vice Magistrate Li**\n\nThe shuttle weaves without cease, hastening west and east,\nRare to meet one with green temples and azure pupils.\nWorldly dreams, long or short, are but phantoms,\nHuman sentiments—are they not all one vast primal chaos?\nBeyond yellow dust lies a forest of jade,\nAmidst white waves, a towering pillar stands.\nWild clouds emerge from the peaks, drifting without rest,\nNow borne by rain, now swept by wind—submitting to neither.\n\n**Elegy for Master Yu the Great**\n\nA master from the Purple Court, a companion of banished immortals,\nYet in the end, he set forth on a boundless journey.\nA thousand samadhis mastered within the heart,\nSeventy-one years of worldly green—now at rest.\nLeaves bright as jade take flight, the mountain cradling the moon,\nThe flute’s echo lingers o’er Yellow Crane Tower.\nGazing into the vastness of the azure sea,\nScattered clouds drift past the isles of phoenix and qilin.\n\n**Admonition to the World**\n\nSpring departs, autumn arrives—no pause,\nThe two wheels of time urge on, merciless.\nOn the snail’s horns, men vie for fame and gain,\nIn the spark’s flash, life and death are lodged.\nThe judgments of the Underworld’s clerks cannot be evaded,\nThe verdicts of Dengdu brook no delay.\nA level path lies plain and clear,\nYet why do the deluded refuse to walk it?\n\n**The Heavenly Net**\n\nVast is the Heavenly Net—none may deceive it,\nThe dark paths of the underworld are too obscure to know.\nGood causes, evil fruits—all shaped by the heart,\nHell and heaven—each fashioned by oneself.\nHungry ghosts and brute beasts, grasping at what they crave,\nDrowned souls and stagnant spirits—fools in their nature.\nI urge you: seek the way home while there’s time,\nFor when the limit comes, regret will be too late.\n\n**To an Old Friend in the Southern Palace**\n\nAmidst the clamor of drums and flutes, stepping onto the stage,\nMimicking forms, they scurry in pretense.\nWho knows the Creator’s idle sport?\nOnly to give onlookers cause to gossip.\nTheir tricks, once displayed, are but a hollow *kharjūra*,\nTheir schemes seen through—no room for negotiation.\nOn a moonlit night in the empty hall, the wind still,\nSitting by the warm brazier, a single stick of incense burns.\n\n**As Before**\n\nI laugh at my own long delusion,\nSeeking the Eastern Sea, yet wandering west.\nGrievances and favors—why speak of them?\nWhat is not tossed and churned cannot be made whole.\nThe world’s savor, once tasted, is sweeter than honey,\nThe nature of things, once seen through, is like drunken stupor.\nNow, each attains a heart of no-use,\nThe moon hangs in the blue sky, water flows in the stream.\n\n**Postscript to the Hall of True Principle’s Fusion**\n\nWhen delusion and stillness are exhausted, purity is achieved,\nThe eye beholds the all-pervading Dharma-body.\nSocial dealings, unbound, flow through the cave of principle,\nThe living mechanism, subtly moving, is none other than my spirit.\nA hundred rivers rush toward the Eastern Sea,\nMyriad lights blaze, encircling the North Star.\nI speak to the spring wind of old tidings,\nWildflowers and fragrant grasses renew all at once.\n\n**As Before**\n\nThe drifting reeds and flowing waves have not left the source,\nWho in this could discern the other?\nFrom brow’s edge to eye’s corner—all is grasped,\nBy willow’s side, before the blossoms—everywhere encountered.\nThe walls and gates are shorn away, no barriers remain,\nThe locks and seals are broken, nothing is closed.\nIn the empty hall, sitting in stillness—man like jade,\nThe wind sways the bamboo’s tips, the moon hangs on the pine.\n\n**Postscript to the *Sitting-in-Forgetfulness* Diagram**\n\nThe old man’s form is stiff as a rooted stump,\nSitting in stillness, yet restless, wandering paths.\nIn an instant, being and non-being merge with chaos,\nHeaven and earth, above and below—a single lotus hut.\nForgetting both admiration and envy of the crane’s distant flight,\nUnwilling to lightly soar like the phoenix of Yexian.\nClods of earth, heaps of dust—do not compare,\nThe vast sky, the great earth—are they not all mine?\n\n**The Chamber of Sincerity**\n\nSincere intent, rectified heart—here this chamber dwells,\nEsteemed teachers and good friends delight in each other’s company.\nBefore the courtyard, emerald bamboos stand in the wind,\nBeneath the steps, red mallows turn toward the sun.\nAt dawn, the trees hear not the celestial music—all is still,\nThrough the night window, the moon’s radiance is shared.\nDoes the falling leaf of the paulownia portend it?\nAlready, autumn’s visage spreads across the nine realms.\n\n**Leisure at Three Mountains**\n\nClumsy and inarticulate, I spare my superiors worry,\nIn my lazy nest, I still delight in pulling my sleeves over my head.\nThickly layered, the sitting mat spans three feet,\nEasily prepared, the monastic gruel fills a single bowl.\nRising by day, sleeping by night—no affairs to attend,\nCold in summer, warm in winter—what more could I seek?\nAt times, the staff of blossoms stirs a wild impulse,\nI roam the Three Mountains and the Ten Isles.\n\n**The Work of Transformation**\n\nClods of earth contend in the empty sky of dreams,\nThe Work of Transformation shifts—utterly without feeling.\nBefore the eyes, fleeting profit is but a painted flower’s blush,\nAbove the head, hollow fame is but a broken drum’s sound.\nA hundred years—long or short—mark life’s bounds,\nA thousand changes—being and non-being—know no end.\nIn the end, what has been accomplished?\nOnly the body’s play with life and death.\n\n**The Creator**\n\nFrom of old, the Creator toys with poverty and success,\nManipulating floating life as if in a dream.\nFame and profit, being and non-being—shifting forms,\nRight and wrong, self and other—vying for supremacy.\nHabits accumulated over many lives—all false from the start,\nTen thousand affairs dissolve—utterly empty in the end.\nDrunk and insensate—who is the master?\nFalling blossoms and flying catkins chase the east wind.\n\n**Following Dong Deqing’s Rhyme**\n\nFor ten years, I’ve not known the scholar’s curtain,\nTending to my true heart, at odds with the world.\nI deeply laugh at Kui’s mutual pity,\nGazing at the ant’s struggle over trifles.\nA sky of wind and moon—idle companions,\nA thousand miles of clouds and mountains—old dependencies.\nMy traveling baggage is light, free of worldly things,\nA broken gourd, a blossom staff—my only garments.\n\n**Recalling Three Mountains While at the Changchun Palace in Yanjing**\n\nOnce in Liang Garden, I laughed and sang,\nGathering herbs with the grace of a lofty breeze.\nThe winding pools and crooked ponds—such scenes,\nSlender bamboos, sparse plums—even more pure.\nAt the turtle’s back in the thatched hall, what thoughts arise?\nMy heart, at the turtle’s head in the mystic garden, is at ease.\nOnly the moon of Three Mountains remains night after night,\nAs before, golden blossoms dip into the blue waves.\n\n*The Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Two, Concludes*\n*The Cloud Mountain Collection, Scroll Three: Five-Character Regulated Verse*",

      "translated_text": "**Five-Character Regulated Verse by Zhi Chang the Perfected, Ji Zhizhen**\n\n**The Nature of the Dao**\nBright, bright—yet not a thing,\nClear, clear—nor mind within.\nVast, vast, it links heaven and earth,\nDark, dark, it threads past and present.\nBeing and nonbeing ever transform,\nBirth and decay drift in false flux.\nNeither gods nor ghosts can fathom,\nWhere to seek the voice-hearers’ trace?\n\n**Endowment**\nThe body’s bones arise from earth,\nThe spirit’s light descends from heaven.\nSix gates—yin ghosts lie subdued,\nThrough all ages, the Valley Spirit whole.\nThe moon of nature shines radiant,\nThe pearl of mind reflects all round.\nWhen the ten thousand hues fade to naught,\nSerene, one reaches the Double Mystery.\n\n**Dispelling Delusion**\nTurn the body free of the world’s net,\nExert force to sever the rope of confusion.\nNo peddler sells the Tower of What,\nWho hangs the puppet stage?\nPlant well the shadowless tree,\nLight high the oil-less lamp.\nThe chamber fills with emptiness and white—\nHow dare illusions cling?\n\n**Seeking the Real**\nWhite jade emerges from stone,\nYellow gold is smelted from ore.\nThe inch of heart leaves love and desire,\nThe single nature shines round and bright.\nIt illumines kalpas beyond count,\nPierces the mustard-seed city’s walls.\nFrom the wheel of rebirth one escapes—\nNo extinction, no birth remains.\n\n**Yielding the Form**\nHeaven’s mandate gathers the yielded substance,\nTransforming things dance in yang’s vigor.\nThe restless sea of right and wrong,\nThe petty realm of fame and gain.\nA hundred years—an instant’s span,\nA thousand ages—a drifting dream.\nSuddenly, one breaks through above—\nThe primal spirit returns to the Emperor’s land.\n\n**Right and Wrong**\nRight and wrong lack fixed decree,\nNo scale can weigh their measure.\nThe principles of things shift moment to moment,\nTime’s light moves instant by instant.\nFlies chase after specks to drive bones,\nSnails quarrel on horns—walking corpses.\nDaubing and smearing through the ages,\nNone discern the offered doubt.\n\n**The Dusty World**\nTen thousand dusts sink in deep pits,\nTwo luminaries race like hurled pellets.\nThe world of snail-horn strife,\nThe officials of the locust-tree court.\nLoyalty and sincerity grieve like uncut jade,\nCunning and flattery weep over pearl platters.\nEndless illusions of delusion—\nThe floating life deceives its own eyes.\n\n**The Great Body**\nHeaven and earth merge in the great form,\nLooking up and down—a lotus hut.\nTen thousand lights hang high as mirrors,\nGrasses grow like counted chariots.\nBeing and nonbeing—divine transformations,\nWaxing and waning—qi’s breath.\nNot yet beyond the great furnace,\nHow can one roam the Great Void?\n\n**Night Sitting**\nSitting dry, the dust of the heart dies,\nForgetting words, the Dao’s flavor lingers.\nNot named the snail’s realm,\nNo dreams in the tortoise-shell frontier.\nThe kang warms—leaves burn often,\nThe stove glows—incense coils fresh.\nNight deepens—limitless thoughts,\nThe bright moon fills the empty hall.\n\n**Serene Simplicity**\nSitting firm on the rush mat’s strength,\nThe body warm in the sleeve’s coarse cloth.\nPinching incense to honor the rustic guest,\nBoiling tea at the mountain boy’s call.\nTo send off—what laziness in the heart,\nTo clamor—ears seem deaf.\nDwelling in the mountains suits plainness,\nHow lovable this household’s way.\n\n**Carefree Indolence**\nBefore guests, forget to lift the whisk,\nCall the boy—weary of striking the bell.\nThe medicine stove’s embers remain,\nScriptures gather dust, sealed.\nNo thought to pen chickens and dogs,\nNo talk of befriending tigers and dragons.\nIn all things, no reliance—\nOnly this carefree indolence remains.\n\n**Within the Abode**\nMoss invades the new steps,\nPine shadows scatter the ancient altar.\nBoiling tea with fallen leaves,\nStirring the fire with mountain sandalwood.\nThe wall’s moon pierces the thatched hut,\nFragrant winds stir the medicine rail.\nSo refreshing—this pure savor,\nKindred spirits, fear not the cold.\n\n**The Master’s Chamber**\nThe master’s chamber holds the true realm,\nThe lotus hut reflects the jeweled terrace.\nThe door’s lintel hides the Three Realms,\nThe curtain rolls open the Nine Heavens.\nStriking jade, cloud-cakes gather,\nRinging metal, the crane’s chariot hastens.\nIn the grotto, people do not age,\nGreen wine ever keeps them company.\n\n**Worldly Affairs**\nWorldly affairs are boundless,\nHuman life has its own measure.\nNot understanding the pivot’s first use,\nOne is deluded by things’ emotions.\nOffering laughter to guard the eyes,\nFacing danger, one regrets too late.\nBefore it happens, first grasp it—\nLift up to climb heaven’s ladder.\n\n**Cloud Wandering**\nLoosen the moorings of the empty boat,\nUnlock the iron lock’s clasp.\nThe body’s needs—leisurely days,\nA hundred patches—old livelihood.\nKicking and leaping, one asks the world,\nDrifting, drifting—home beyond form.\nGather well the rainbow staff,\nHook and bait—drink cloud and mist.\n\n**Recalling the Mountains**\nCarefree and proud in forests and springs,\nWho speaks of Buddha or immortal?\nSweep away the reins and fetters,\nSever the kudzu vines’ entanglements.\nNot fawning in the human world,\nForgetting the heaven beyond things.\nWild clouds, the creek’s moon—\nUnbounded, the soaring spirit.\n\n**Ease**\nWherever one is, seek the body’s ease,\nNothing like inquiring within the square inch.\nPoverty and success—times’ ties,\nLife and death—the fate’s bond.\nThe wondrous body beyond yin and yang,\nThe form left behind in heaven and earth.\nMysteriously linked to the Maker,\nSilently turning the wheel of right and wrong.\n\n**Paper Quilt**\nNot obtained from the Wang household,\nFirst bestowed by the Cai family.\nThe work is easily done,\nThe warmth—no wonder.\nHanging on the wall, clouds return to the peaks,\nCovering the head, snow rests on the mountains.\nNot seeking the world’s esteem,\nIt befits this body’s leisure.\n\n**Twelve Poems Sent from the Eastern Cottage at Purple Tenuity**\n\n**Spring**\nDelighted to build and plant,\nWork follows creation’s unfolding.\nVegetable plots beside the well,\nHerb gardens near the wall’s embrace.\nPeaches and plums bloom in order,\nLush and clinging, the wild grasses.\nUnaware of worldly affairs,\nDaily life—truly carefree.\n\n**Summer**\nFlower hedges encroach on the wild meadows,\nLush greens meet the empty hall.\nTall trees—thousands of trunks unite,\nCool shade—frost on all sides.\nPlums heap ripe on the branches,\nFragrance spills through the garden.\nNo need to weigh coins—\nThe farm folk offer them to taste.\n\n**Autumn**\nFarmers gather the hundred grains,\nCrisp air comes from the western suburbs.\nSweeping again the leaves before the steps,\nAdding more thatch to the roof.\nFrost descends on the red brocade trees,\nCold hastens the saffron buds.\nNo sign of people or oxen,\nOnly the herding boy’s whistle heard.\n\n**Winter**\nDouble doors, curtains unrolled,\nThe kang warm, paper windows bright.\nNo inquiry of the garden’s phase,\nForgetting the snow-wrapped blossoms.\nBurning incense, mist’s hues congeal,\nBoiling tea, the wind’s sound rises.\nSitting in repose on the rush mat,\nWhat does the human world make of it?\n\n**Day**\nThe thatched hut—still and desolate,\nThe kitchen boy needs no knife.\nThe mountain boy forbids cunning cuts,\nThe rustic guest calls for a roam.\nPaths narrow—trampled by people,\nPlots overgrown—planted with a staff’s play.\nUtterly free of the world’s burdens,\nTrue joy—naturally content.\n\n**Night**\nThe watch late, the door unlatched,\nWrapped in coarse cloth, the Valley Spirit congeals.\nAt the forest’s edge hangs the golden mirror,\nFrom the eaves’ teeth—the jade rope’s bones.\nIn the stove, embers live on,\nBeneath the window, the clear lamp continues.\nThe night deepens—what boundless thoughts,\nThe bright moon fills the empty hall.",

yet none may comprehend,\nthe bridal chamber sealed deep in white clouds.\n\n**Dust-Brushing**\nCultivation, in essence, is heart-cultivation,\nscraping away dust and vines, ten thousand cares sink.\nRevealed, the primal, luminous thing—\nno need for knowing, no need for seeking.\n\n**Emptiness**\nCultivate the heart-ground to be empty,\nshatter every dust-mote, every instant.\nThen appears the primal true face—\nneither loss nor gain, neither excess nor lack.\n\n**Form and Count**\nShort or long, roughly a hundred years,\nfretful, toiling life—empty in the end.\nLook above for the true matter,\nthe secret transmission of the flame, endless in use.\n\n**Lost Heart**\nThe heart, bright yet adrift, cast upon dust and sand,\nlike sweeping fallen blossoms at the brushwood gate.\nNo hand can gather it back—\nborne by wind and water, it never returns home.\n\n**Taming the Heart**\nTen thousand threads of circumstance disturb the heart’s spirit,\nred dust thickens, veiling the mirror’s face.\nA master’s hand applies its skill, polishing it clean—\ncold light shines through, illuminating all.\n\n**Longevity**\nLongevity—what of the illusory body?\nCount spent, return to the source, buried in earth.\nOnly the original true nature—who grasps it?\nFrom ancient times to now, no going, no coming.\n\n**Arising and Ceasing**\nThe wheel of arising and ceasing stems from the heart,\nthought upon thought flowing, from ancient times to now.\nGround to ash, it stirs not in flight—\nsuddenly, a solitary moon rises over the jade peak.\n\n**Seeking Within**\nThe celestial true nature lies within—seek not without,\nphantasmal dust, clod of earth—let all such matters rest.\nA vast, idle expanse of clear, frozen ground—\nwhite jade, yellow gold, not worth its price.\n\n**Leisurely Dwelling**\nIn the land of Great Peace, a man of Great Peace,\nbeneath the Two Forests, in the mountain’s embrace, this body lodged.\nCloud friends meet—nothing to say,\na hundred flowers sing, birds call—one spring.\n\n**Revisiting the Old**\nSitting, gazing heavenward, sighing,\nsinging the *Yang Pass*—will there be a reunion?\nShadow-grass, probing pole—both laid down,\nall trace the gourd’s outline as before.\n\n**Dusty Realm**\nWhite waves surge—sea of right and wrong,\nyellow dust rolls—market of fame and profit.\nHelpless, the warring snail and ant clans,\nunaware of their fleeting, insubstantial lives.\n\n**Form’s Faintness**\nA snail’s two horns—an age-old tale,\na spark from stone—a hundred-year body.\nWho has eyes vast as cartwheels,\nseeing through the boundless, rolling dust?\n\n**Obstruction’s Speech**\nPlucking twigs, gathering leaves—still tossed by waves,\nthe vast, untainted source remains untouched.\nHang the question on the wall, sit idly,\nall drunk, stumbling toward Chang’an.\n\n**Breaking the Net**\nThe world’s net loosely woven, yet the Dharma’s net confines,\nexamining oneself, bound and shackled—self-entwined.\nOne tug at the prison’s bolt—all falls away,\nstaff and sandals in the western wind, a nodding smile.\n\n**Sitting Alone**\nA hundred patches, cloud-draped, staff and sandals idle,\na thatched hut, briefly Mount Zaotan’s incense.\nGuests come seeking the Way—no words to say,\nlaughing, pointing to empty space, \"Look closely.\"\n\n**Guarding Folly**\nNot learning the cold cat’s mouse-stalking folly,\nwindow bright, hearth warm, sleeves layered.\nGuests sit face to face, as if deceived,\nasked of the world’s affairs—all unknown.\n\n**Sitting Long**\nClouds mirror green mountains, pleasing the rustic heart,\ngrass mats, flat stones, old pine’s shade.\nSitting deeper into nothingness,\nheedless of the vast sky, the sun’s descent.\n\n**Guarding Clumsiness**\nForgotten the furnace’s alchemy of lead and mercury,\noutside the gate, let the kudzu vines grow long.\nNothing worth doing—days passed in idleness,\nall laugh at my hundredfold incompetence.\n\n**Thatched Hut**\nOvergrown paths, three measures—no visitors,\nwindows and doors creak, autumn’s clarity.\nYet the true flavor of congeniality is found—\nnot a speck of worldly dust reaches the heart.\n\n**Startling the World**\nPlunging deep into the market of profit and fame,\nbound and wearied, the heart grows ever more wounded.\nDiscarding weight for lightness—perverse use,\nwhere one should build a dike, none is built.\n\n**Vain Life**\nToiling, restless, body and heart not free,\na hundred years, wind-driven foam on water.\nVain life, reckless death—no limit,\nsee through it, return, and be done.\n\n**Peaceful Life**\nFrowning, debating old and new,\nin a blink—who knows the shift from ancient to now?\nPresent, future—both unrecognized,\nask who permits the question of peaceful heart?\n\n**Attached to Things**\nFleeting fame, fleeting profit—how deep the intent?\nSchemes exhausted, the heart broken in use.\nAll for descendants’ thousand-year plans,\nheedless of bones crumbling into earth.\n\n**Pursuing Circumstances**\nBefore one’s eyes, yellow dust churns,\ngreat transformation shifts, moment by moment new.\nIn the pit of birth and death, none awaken,\nabandoning the self only to cling to profit and fame.\n\n**Fame and Profit**\nServants, horses, carriages, boats—perils endured,\npetty fame and profit, both entwined.\nPondering, one sought only peace and stability,\nyet body and heart know no moment’s rest.\n\n**Guests Arrive**\nHearing the carriage’s knock at the brushwood gate,\npatched robe hastily donned, a forced welcome.\nKnowing no money for village wine,\na bowl of spring snow—frugal fellowship.\n\n**Passing Quietly**\nThe bridal chamber unlocked, never barred,\nthe azure vault vast, the moon fills the courtyard.\nFor ages, cloud and lute—strings never strung,\nnight’s chill, flowing water—cold, clear tones.\n\n**Shedding Dust**\nShedding dust, shedding Dharma, shedding all threads,\nno talk of elixir perfected, ascending the ninth heaven.\nDelusion gone, truth does not stand—\nno words reach the profound mystery.\n\n**Unknowing**\nA thousand differences, ten thousand divergences—none can be made equal,\nleaping beyond constraint into unknowing.",

breeze clears, robes grow chill,\nbefore the mountain, travelers’ brows drip with sweat.\nImmortal and mortal are not far—yet cloud and mud divide them,\nfame and profit drive men, never granting them rest.\n\n**Autumn**\n\nThe heat’s departure in the mountains goes wholly unnoticed,\nyet suddenly the yellow chrysanthemums vie in fragrance.\nA single day’s stern decree from the west wind—\nscattered across half the sky, red leaves take flight.\n\n**Winter**\n\nFrost and snow ravage the brocade’s emptiness,\nthe mountains’ old forms remain all around.\nDeep in the night, seated in

transcendence,\nthe lost child of the family forgets even to return.\nUnknowing, he breaks through the papered window—\nreleasing the foolish fly to fly freely at last.\n\n**Near the Body**\n\nThe sea boy plays in the water, the gulls sense him first,\nthe dull-witted fool holds his pole, the cicada knows nothing.\nProfound and subtle, hiding the self with no place to abide,\nmeeting Ji Xian, one appears just as foolish.\n\n**On Movement and Stillness: Two Poems for Xu Shaoming**\n\n**I**\n\nMove and you follow others; still, you grow dull—\nbetween the two, forgotten, lies the living pivot.\nOnly when the tongueless speak can one converse,\nthen trust that names and words are truly right and wrong.\n\n**II**\n\nOn the central plain, wolves and tigers rage, drooling,\nyet a peach-blown refuge hides a cavern heaven.\nFlowing water, falling blossoms—still they remain,\nI bid you board the headless boat.\n\n**As Before**\n\nAt the immortal’s high assembly, speaking of Fanghu,\nlaughing, they point to Penglai—its waters nearly dry.\nNo need to sing of herding oxen and eating white stones,\nbetter to seek the formless and demand the dark pearl.\n\n**Returning from

and returned.\n\n**As Before**\n\nThe weak, mourning their lost homeland, know nothing,\non the path of the forgetful sheep, they grow ever more lost.\nBest to gather early the clouds-and-mist bait,\none oar through the wind and moonlight on the stream.\n\n**The Moon of Nature**\n\nVast, the numinous wind sweeps all clean,\nthe sky of nature brandishes—no wisp of cloud remains.\nHeaven and earth, one hue, like a silver realm,\nreleasing the radiant, never-dark pearl.\n\n**Warning the World**\n\nSwift as a shuttle, time is cast away,\nin an instant, old age—twin temples grizzled.\nWhen the unseen summons comes to call,\nhands and feet in panic—what can you do?\n\n**The Heart’s Mechanism**\n\nThe heart’s mechanism exhausted for the family’s sake,\nwhite hair hangs heavy, eyes grow dim.\nIn the end, not knowing where it will alight,\non the verge of departure, still instructing sons and grandsons.\n\n**A Hundred Years**\n\nA hundred years of time—just a moment,\ngreedily scheming all day with cunning.\nEvery needle, every blade of grass—predestined,\nyet one forces body and mind to never rest.\n\n**Old Yan**\n\nOld Yan is merciless—who does not know?\nBefore one’s

groves—all are mystery,\nthe cold jade’s pure sound rinses the flowing spring.\nSitting in forgetfulness, who understands the lingering light?\nDew drips from the pine tips—the moon is full.\n\n**The Idle One**\n\nWind through the woods, moonlight veiling mountain blossoms,\nstrange rocks, stream—all one family.\nOnly the idle one is fit to preside,\nwithout feeling, without self—companion to mist and clouds.\n\n**Cultivating the True**\n\nTo cultivate the true—what is there to cultivate?\nWith a shout, sever all ties—ten thousand affairs cease.\nPerfecting the inherent, original virtue-power,\nstep by step, follow the bright moon to Yingzhou.\n\n**Immortals**\n\nSeek not immortals beyond yourself—\nthey are but the original, single heart.\nUnfettered, beyond the dust’s grasp,\nthey teach the great earth to turn to gold.\n\n**Prolonging Life**\n\nThere is a way to prolong life, never to die—\nbest to empty the cinnabar crucible and ask the Medicine King.\nWhen the mundane heart is wholly carved away, cast into the divine elixir,\nlike the cicada’s molt—clearly shedding the bitter husk.\n\n**Reciting Scriptures**\n\nSpreading nets, setting snares—accumulating karma,\nin old age, thoughtlessly chanting *maha*.\nClinging to delusion, vainly seeking future blessings—\nhow will Old Yan ever let you pass?\n\n**The Butterfly Dream**\n\nAs Zhou, as butterfly—two forms divide,\nyet who has seen the dreamer?\nGrasping the message of fluttering lotus,\nthe vast sky, great earth—all is my body.\n\n**Kui and the Mosquito**\n\nThe celestial truth’s use—all-pervading spirit,\npiercing the formless and the formed alike.\nWondrous function, driving and guiding—everywhere present,\nmoon bright on the river, wine just sobered.\n\n**The Liang Bridge**\n\nFrom the outset, no joy, no knowledge,\njoy and knowledge arise—second mechanism.\nTracing back to the source, seeking where knowing begins,\nfish and self—naturally return as one.\n\n**The Ox’s Disassembly**\n\nWorldly affairs pile like mountains, heap like peaks,\ndismantling them is like no dismantling—the blade’s edge vast.\nUnwilling to sharply judge the tangled,\nguard the spirit’s edge closely—do not idly unsheathe.\n\n**Herding Horses**\n\nSacred wisdom, slippery and cunning, deludes the great array,\nthe wild boy, sickly and blind, yet teaches heaven.\nThe finest dust harms the nature—it must be pared away,\nrevealing the original, wondrous and untransmitted.\n\n**Raising Chickens**\n\nOnce the original is fully awakened, rest the heart,\nprecisely because there is no heart—deeper the merit.\nSeated, like wood carved or clay molded,\nwhat in the world dares encroach?\n\n**Catching the Cicada**\n\nThe old man still has not forgotten his art,\nthe cicada’s wing hides the body—the cicada knows nothing.\nWhen you reach the realm of ghosts and spirits, beyond reckoning,\nplucking it up, effortlessly—what doubt remains?\n\n**Taming the Gulls**\n\nOne’s own spirit is the spirit of things,\nif one is without heart, things naturally grow still.\nThe empty realm, by chance, opens a single thread—\nthe sea gulls

ruse,\nboth sorrow and joy forgotten.\nTurning back to the old homeland,\nall its scenes now desolate.\n\nA hundred years of this body—\na snap of the fingers, temples turned to frost.\nIf others ask, pay no heed,\nbear it all in steadfast stillness.\nOn quiet nights, wind soft and moon bright,\nfacing cloud companions and rosy friends,\nlaughter and talk stretch long.\nA bowl of heart-cleansing tea,\na petal of incense from before the kalpas.\n\n---\n\n**Water Melody (Fifth)**\n\nA wanderer in foreign lands,\ntrampling the soft red dust.\nReturning, every door and courtyard,\nbamboo blinds

endures.\n\nEntering the realm of nothingness,\nroaming the great desert,\ncrossing Kunlun’s peaks.\nThat message of the wind immortal—\nnot to be heard lightly.\nEyes dazzled by falling

veiled the face of Crane Mountain.\n\nYears pass,\naffairs change,\nsuddenly the pact grows cold.\nStraw sandals and cassia staff remain,\nonly the memory of knocking at the mystery’s gate.\nWishing

awakening.\nTesting ancient and modern deeds,\nshifting to mere words, all jumbled.\nNot forged within the heart,\nthrough countless kalpas, empty and lost.\nGrasping the original truth—\nthe spirit’s mouth cannot speak it,\nwhere to learn?\n\nNothing at all,\nutterly empty.\nEver pure, ever vast,\npervading the boundless.\nApply effort to nurture,\nno need for reckless abandon.\nWho can harmonize

cloud-heart’s hollow whiteness.\nThe imperial seal splits—\na single petal lifted, pure fragrance brims,\nsteeping all in mist, the numinous void unbarred.\nIt drifts through the Three Realms in harmony,\npiercing height and depth, penetrating metal and stone.\nThe divine land first congeals in the jade cauldron,\nrecalling how on the unbudded branch,\na trace of spring’s hue once glimmered.\nHow many know—\nthe dust-bound world obstructs,\ndenying even the gourd’s clear sight?\nQi dense and unbroken,\nthe high immortals of cavern-palaces all silently meet.\nButterflies and bees swarm in vain,\nnowhere to alight—\nethereal, trailing threads congeal in emptiness,\nentering the vast sky as one.\n\n---\n\n**Second Stanza: After the Lotus Pond’s Rain Ceases**\nOn the wave’s surface leans\njade blossoms mirrored in limpid clarity.\nThe lad is bidden to pluck them,\nsilver scoops to steep—\nthe fairy of Mount Gu She, frozen in purity.\nIn silence it speaks:\nthe vast earth and boundless sky all gathered in a pinch,\nno great nor small,\ndrawn in to be stored in the *pattra* leaf.\nUnfurled, the true light of subtle medicine,\nthe dust-sand realm\nfully awakens at dawn.\nA single stem, darkly transmitted since antiquity,\nemerges from the realm of sound and form,\nextending its vast and boundless tongue.\nDo not discriminate—\nthe finest particle received,\nentering the eye as golden flakes.\nBrushing away the near and far,\neach and every thing holds boundless treasuries.\nIdle peach and plum trees\nleak their true countenances.\nWho now dares to take up the task,\nentrusting it to the moon on the flower’s tip?\n\n---\n\n**Joy of the Level Sky**\nSelf-enslaved by form,\ncold and hunger assail,\nno different from superfluous growths.\nProbe the empty and profound from the primal origin—\nthere is a single point, round and bright, boundless.\nDust-green stretches vast,\nlike a thousand miles of clear sky,\nillusion spawns cloudy veils.\nRely on this numinous wind,\nblowing all away in an instant, leaving no trace.\nComing—suddenly,\ngoing—wherever,\nfollowing that speck,\nbe it mouse liver or insect limb.\nThe great furnace of transformation,\nexistence and extinction alike—\nwhat beyond this is to be feared?\nMeeting demons or obstacles,\nriding the divine steed or corpse-cart,\nwho reckons departure or stay?\nSit steadfast, forgetful of care,\nfrom beginning to end, rely on this resolve.\n\n---\n\n**Spring Comes from Heaven Above**\nLayer upon layer of dust.\nAlas, since ancient times, endlessly,\nnone awaken from their burial.\nIn the arena of profit and fame,\namid the throng of self and others,\nthey recognize only this bodily form.\nRecall the original single point—\nwho lacks a share?\nAll are immortal material.\nYet they hesitate, suspect.\nCall them a thousand times, drunk,\nthey refuse to turn their heads.\nWhen will they startle awake in dreams,\nseeing through all that came before,\nthe white ants’ court and locust tree?\nIn the depths of the grotto-heaven,\nwith rosy-cloud friends and mist companions,\nthey converse, tasting ice and snow.\nFacing the purple mushrooms of the secluded garden,\nfragrant winds enfold,\ngreen wine pours into cups.\nTruly carefree!\nWith dragons coiling and tigers circling,\nthey sink into drunkenness in Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Second Stanza: The Emperor’s Birthday**\nHeaven bestows auspicious omens.\nNow the Nine-Five Dragon soars,\nthe great enterprise flourishes.\nTurning the vast creation,\nsetting the cosmos in order,\nthunder roars and lightning flashes to compose the pattern.\nToward the jade capital and golden towers,\nthe mighty sound shakes—\ngall bladders of distant lands burst in fear.\nSurpassing the age of Yao and Tang.\nSurely the true conjunction arrives,\nthe four seas at peace and prosperous.\nWhy speak of all under heaven?\nEven the lowliest creatures,\nall rely on his aid and rectification.\nUpright as the *qiao* orchid,\nsunflowers turn their hearts,\nhow to repay the grace of his beneficent radiance?\nThe stove’s orchid perfumes the auspicious mist,\npraying for the yellow palace,\nbranches and leaves united in fragrance.\nWe pray for our emperor:\nmay the dragon’s chart stand firm forever,\nhis sacred longevity boundless.\n\n---\n\n**Third Stanza: The Snail-Shell World of Existence**\nIn the ebb and flow of a single qi,\nwinding and cycling.\nWithin the lightning’s shadow,\namid the spark of flint,\nbirth and extinction in such fleeting moments.\nAll exhaust themselves in restless striving,\nname and profit\nclashing to the death.\nSelf-destructing—\nfor a mass of illusion,\na hundred kinds of schemes.\nThe eyelash before the eye unseen,\nmistaking the false for true,\nutterly deluded and stubborn.\nPeace is hard to encounter,\nthe true Dao hard to meet—\nrecognize the old homeland of days past.\nArriving in the land of nothingness,\ntreading clouds and mist,\ngathering jade medicines and magic mushrooms.\nJoining the immortal ranks,\ncelebrating long spring in heaven above,\ndescending to fill the mortal realm.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Stanza: Fat Horses and Light Robes**\nWealth and honor enfold merit and fame,\nthe heart drunk as if intoxicated.\nThe spring dream of the pillow—\nwho believes in the roc’s journey,\nthe vast wings soaring southward?\nEnsnared by the illusions of the present,\nvainly entangled,\nbearing the yoke and carrying the burden.\nWhat more can be endured?\nChasing the fly’s head and snail’s horn,\nbitterly, greedily craving.\nOne day, eyes open at last,\nin the arena of fame and profit,\nthey halt their chariots and rest their steeds.\nBeyond the whip’s reach,\nshattering the web of doubt,\nlaughing at the evening’s four and morning’s three.\nThe original single point appears,\nserene within—\nthe autumn moon on the cold pool.\nWithin this, they contemplate.\nListen to the golden lads’ ballads,\nthe jade maidens’ profound discourse.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth Stanza: Withered Wood and Cold Ash**\nDwelling in a rustic cottage,\na thatched hall in the wilds,\nsecluded among pines and forests.\nThe land remote, the people quiet,\nmoon bright, wind clear,\nwindows and doors free of dust’s touch.\nThere is a natural message,\nsilver radiance gleaming,\npearls and jade, coral and gems.\nTruly carefree!\nBehold the dragon coiling in the golden tripod,\nthe phoenix dancing on the cinnabar terrace.\nThe whole world drunk on fame and profit—\nwho else, relying on the roc’s journey,\nbreaks through the dense net?\nIf these words are believed,\nstalwart men,\ndo not let go and return empty-handed.\nRecognizing emptiness as illusion,\nhow can it be accomplished?\nIn vain, they tarnish immortal material.\nReturn early!\nAttend the grand gathering of the peach banquet,\nlaughing and conversing in Penglai.\n\n---\n\n**Rain-Scattered Flowers**\nA single numinous source,\nlucid and penetrating,\nthe dust of passions from kalpas past.\nThere is an unending celestial realm of wind and things,\nexisting since time immemorial.\nThe jade qilin squats and

      "translated_text": "**Stele Record of Patriarch Chongyang’s Inauguration of the Dao**\n*Composed by Zhi Chang the Perfected, Ji Zhizhen*\n\nIn origin, the Supreme Dao emerged from primordial heaven. The Most High established its foundation, and successive sages inherited and expanded its legacy. The numinous source and wondrous root, once revealed, remain unobscured; the hidden pass and mysterious gate stand wide, never sealed. From this, teachings were established, and each generation produced those who upheld them.\n\nYet as the world waxed and waned, and the times shifted, the age grew distant from the sages, and the radiance of the spirit no longer shone. Waves surged, divergent schools vied for dominance, branches and leaves proliferated, and frivolous embellishments flourished. The great simplicity of the nameless was scattered, the elusive pearl of the formless was lost. Forgetting the root and straying from the source, people chased after sounds and colors. The true path became obstructed, and the Dao grew desolate and barren.\n\nThus, the sage arose anew, delving into the primal origin of the one qi of heaven. The great work was renewed, aligning with the convergence of the myriad spirits. Heaven endowed and divinely bestowed, striving to restore the crumbling order. The patriarch established the lineage, renewing the bonds of transmission. Casting aside the superficial and gathering the essential, he rescued the drowning and guided the lost, reforming corruption and revitalizing the Dao, until the mysterious gate was reopened. This was none other than Patriarch Chongyang.\n\nHis surname was Wang, personal name Jia, courtesy name Zhiming, and Daoist name Chongyangzi. A native of Xianyang in Jingzhao, he possessed a stalwart frame and an untrammeled spirit, his profound insight spanning the vast and boundless. In secret communion, he aligned with the abstruse, his wisdom penetrating the true source, his conduct transcending the sea of dharmas. His vast capacity took emptiness and nonbeing as its essence, the corporeal form unworthy of concern. His mysterious workings paired with the transformations of creation, and worldly passions stilled at once. He shattered illusions as easily as crushing withered wood or snapping rotten reeds, and severed doubts like uprooting mushrooms or tearing away couch grass. Steadfast as a great bell hung in the void, resplendent as a precious mirror raised on high.\n\nFrom his encounter at Gan River, he secretly received the divine elixir; through the communion of poured water, his wisdom treasury was flung open. Thus, his nature’s heaven congealed in stillness, his ocean of awakening vast and boundless. When he sat in silent meditation at noon, the thunderous roar of profound silence suddenly resounded; when the crows flew over Liu and Jiang, the moon of perfect clarity shone without end. He manifested earthly omens, deeply shouldering the celestial mandate. In the \"living death\" of his tomb, he demonstrated the profound revival after apparent demise; his spirit tablet proclaimed the eternal freedom of the primal origin. Like a rare jade blossom, few recognized his brilliance; like the reopening of stone marrow, few encountered him.\n\nThereupon, he sought disciples to carry on the flame of his lineage, foreseeing them on the eastern shores. Burning his hermitage and sweeping away its traces, he set forth with staff in hand, journeying through the clouds. To others, he declared: \"I shall capture a horse among Qiu, Liu, and Tan.\" The world, unaware of his meaning, dismissed him as mad, and none believed him.\n\nIn the summer of the seventh year of the Dading era, in the fourth month, he set out eastward, reaching Ninghai and Dengzhou in Laizhou. Raising a banner of iridescent transformation, he cast the bait of clouds and mist. Through expedient means and divine transformations, in less than a few years, he drew forth seven vessels fit to receive the Dao. Among them were indeed Qiu, Liu, Tan, and Ma—dragons within the Dao. He bestowed upon Master Ma the name Danyangzi, Master Tan the name Changzhenzi, Master Liu the name Changshengzi, and Master Qiu the name Changchunzi. Alongside these four were Yuyangzi Master Wang, Guangningzi Master Hao, and the Unfettered Adept Qingjing, all of whom attained sudden enlightenment upon witnessing his presence. He instructed each to cultivate according to their circumstances, refining the self and nurturing the true.\n\nHe then led the four masters to Daliang, lodging at the Cizhi Inn of the Wang family in Yuetai Ward. Morning and night, they gathered to refine and polish one another, plumbing the depths of the Dao’s mysteries. One day, he addressed the four: \"Each of you must guard your own nature and life. Should doubts arise, consult Danyang. I now go to keep my appointment with the Perfected.\" The following day, he indeed ascended in a radiance of mist. This occurred on the fourth day of the first month in the gengyin year of the Dading era. He was fifty-eight years of age.\n\nHis wondrous transformations and divine manifestations are recorded elsewhere and cannot be fully recounted here. His sacred remains were later interred on Mount Zhongnan. At that time, the great dynasty flourished, venerating the Dao and its virtue. After Perfected Changchun responded to the imperial summons, the mystic wind surged, and the teachings of the Dao thrived day by day. Subsequently, Perfected Qinghe, successor to the lineage, commanded his disciples to develop the burial site into Chongyang Abbey. The place of his ascension was then grandly renovated into Chaoyuan Abbey.\n\nLet us consider: those in the world who claim to have attained the Dao are invariably scrutinized for their deeds; those said to have achieved immortality are invariably judged by their extraordinary feats; those who seek longevity are invariably expected to preserve their form and remain in the world. Yet they fail to grasp that divine transformations and wondrous manifestations, ever-shifting and without constancy, are but the objects of admiration for those who delight in the strange—mere deceptive tricks in the eyes of Daoists.\n\nAs for the root and origin, the eternal and unchanging from time immemorial, how could such things be easily seen or known by the vulgar? The Patriarch’s advent served but to transmit this truth. Thus, the shifts of qi’s movement cannot be controlled, the impulses of transformation never truly arise. Roaming freely in the boundless expanse, wandering unfettered in the vast wilderness, hidden or manifest, unpredictable, responding to change without fixed form—subtle as to enter the finest hair, vast as to embrace the cosmos, existing yet not existing, dwelling in emptiness yet not empty—pure and contending with the original state, constant as ancient and modern.\n\nThe Patriarch established his foundation upon this principle and engaged the world accordingly. Through the transformation of form to expound the Dao, he directly entered the realm of neither death nor life, merging with the Dao as one. Yet even this is but a superficial glimpse of his edge, not the essence of his nearness. That which is near cannot be fathomed even by the most eloquent. How much less can it be expressed?\n\nWith clumsy strokes, I respectfully inscribe this inscription.",

      "translated_text": "The Primordial Virtue is an ocean of longevity, vast and boundless. Its radiance treasures the celestial palace, pure and unchanging. The Patriarch came from the West, transmitting this wondrous essence. With a flourish of numinous emptiness, he stilled the leviathan and mended the broken. Four disciples followed, embracing the One School of Non-Action. With single-minded devotion, they revered the ancient true visage. When the elixir was perfected and the world wearied of, he shed his form like a cicada casting its husk—shedding form, shedding dharma, returning to the boundless. Time could not constrain him, nor place obstruct. Moving between being and non-being, his spiritual powers were free and untrammeled. To honor these numinous traces, a palace was established. Like flame kindling flame, the mysterious wind spread far. The stele of Qiyun Abbey on Mount Zhongnan.\n\nThe essence of the Quanzhen School had fermented for years, its flame passed from torch to torch, unbroken through ancient and modern times. Yet those who concealed themselves in profound obscurity, making their teachings difficult to disseminate, guarded their radiance to the edge of extinction, forsaking the world and leaving humanity behind—dwelling in solitude. Their teaching took \"ascending through the profound mystery\" as its core, \"non-action and purity\" as its constant, and \"resonance with dharma\" as its periphery. Gathering the real and discarding the ornamental, returning to simplicity and restoring the uncarved block—this was the heart-seal of the Old Master.\n\nAt the dawn of the Huangtong era, Patriarch Chongyang emerged from the dust, preserving his spirit and encountering transformation, at last illuminating the light. He transmitted this Dao to several disciples by the sea—those such as Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu. Though the root was strengthened, the teaching had not yet flourished widely. It was not until the Longxing era of our imperial dynasty, after the Perfected One of Everlasting Spring arose and responded to the summons, that the mysterious wind surged, its transformation harmonizing all directions. Disciples everywhere established abbeys and temples—from ancient times to the present, never had there been such prosperity.\n\nAmong his followers was Master Ren, a man of Xiangtai. Forsaking the secular, he embraced the mysterious and journeyed north to Yan and Ji, becoming a disciple of the Perfected One of Qiyun. He followed the Dao for years, receiving its secrets in silence. In the spring of the *yiyou* year, he descended the mountain and soared like a bird, spreading the teaching through Qin and Jin, reaching Mount Zhongnan and the Palace of Longevity of Chongyang. Five *li* away, there was a hamlet called Liangjiazhu, where it was said an ancient Abbey of Grotto Purity stood—established by the divine transformation of Chongyang. The truth of this was unclear.

      "translated_text": "Having secured this site and obtained a grant from the Office of the Capital Prefecture, they were permitted to reclaim and develop it. The abbot, Master Ren, led his disciples—Li Zhicong, Wen Zhiqing, and dozens of others—in concerted effort, laboring together to rebuild the abbey. Spanning over seventy *mu*, the grounds were traversed by paths winding through tall bamboo, encircled by clear streams. Halls and sanctuaries stood complete, corridors aligned in order, the Square Pot Pavilion nestled behind, and secluded chambers hidden in quietude.\n\nThereupon, the imperial commissioner, the honorable Zhang of the Xila clan, lent his support to the endeavor. The Pure Harmony Perfected One inscribed the plaque, naming it \"Abbey of Perching Clouds,\" designating it a place for extending the sovereign’s longevity and offering prayers and supplications. With heart’s incense frequently kindled, the winds of the Mysterious Ancestor were glorified; with the lamp of nature ever burning, the transformation of the Perfect Realization was revealed.\n\nOn the day of its completion, they commanded the carving of jade-green stone to perpetuate its legacy. Thus, an inscription was composed:\n\n*\"The wheel of mechanism renews daily, thus perfect and true.\nUpheld by profound stillness, preserved in pure simplicity.\nThe advent of the Patriarch, as if this very teaching were new.\nBy the shores of the Eastern Sea, passed to a few disciples.\nThe great revival of the Mysterious Wind, the divine vessel universally revealed.\nAmidst the vast kalpas, rarely encountered—how fitting to set one’s resolve!\nThose who enter this gate, how could they not reflect?\nRising early and retiring late, strive to emulate this way.\"*\n\n**Stele of the Abbey of Perching Clouds in Luoyang**\n\nAt the dawn of the Sagely Ancestor’s reign, he sought to summon those of the Dao. Following the summons of the Perfected One of Eternal Spring, the transformation spread boundlessly, the Dao’s radiance grew ever brighter, and the Mysterious Wind flourished. The call to don cap and robe drew crowds like mist gathering and clouds converging; the construction of abbeys and temples spread like stars in the sky or pieces on a chessboard. If even distant frontiers were thus, how much more so the Central Plains?\n\nSouth of this capital, a day’s journey away, stood an ancient hamlet called Zhuge. To its left rose Song and Shaoshi; to its right, the Dragon Gate loomed. Before it stood Mount Wan’an; to its north flowed the Yi and Luo rivers. Here, an abbey named Perching Clouds was established. Tracing its origins, it was the four disciples of the Perfected One of Perching Clouds who initiated and built it.\n\nIn the autumn of the *xinsi* year, the Perfected One opened the Dao at Mount Pan, and those who came to cultivate were many, seeking to resolve their doubts. His fame spread far, and those in yellow caps and rustic robes who flocked to his gate were beyond counting—he was then the foremost among those who aided the teaching. Among his disciples were four: first, Cui Zhiyin; second, Guan Zhidao; third, Dong Daoheng; and fourth, Li Zhixi. All had studied under him for years, each receiving his seal of approval. Their hearts were in accord, and they were as friends.\n\nIn the ninth month of the *jiawu* autumn, they discussed a journey to gather the Real. Traveling from north to south, they traversed the lands of Yan, Zhao, Qi, and Lu, following the flow or halting as needed, yet not reaching the depths of Tanhuai. At that time, the world had just endured the upheaval of the *renchen* year. The northern gates of Henan’s cities lay in ruins, their inhabitants desolate. From the passes eastward, for over a thousand *li*, all was garrisoned land—wilderness blocked the roads, human traces vanished, and only those bearing arms passed through.\n\nIn the fourth month of the *bingshen* summer, the four crossed Meng Ford and journeyed to Luoyang. By dusk, they reached Chen Chang, where they encountered an old friend, Master Shi. Seeing them, he was overjoyed, treating them with great warmth and reluctance to part, hosting them for months. As they surveyed the bright and elegant mountains and rivers, their hearts found resonance, and they settled like drifting duckweed, arriving at Zhuge. Gazing around, they saw a place no different from deep mountains and vast marshes, far removed from the mortal realm—a fitting site for dwelling in the Real and nurturing vastness.\n\nInquiring of their neighbors, they learned it was the ancestral home of Dong Daoheng. They ascertained the land’s fertility and the boundaries of fields, all overgrown and blocked, with brambles towering to the sky. No master remained, only ruins and scattered tiles. Thereupon, the four resolved to establish an abbey, laying its foundation. Soon after, Wang, Yang, Jiang, and Li arrived, joining their efforts with zeal, vying to contribute. They chose the site, cleared the thatch, and reclaimed the wilderness. Breaking the withered and pulling up the decayed, they cut through thickets of thorns and brambles; sweeping away filth and dispelling disorder, they planted jujube and pear trees. Laboring from dawn to dusk, the land transformed day by day, month by month. Nearly twenty years passed, and the abbey gradually flourished.\n\nThey erected the Main Hall to enshrine the Three Clarities, and behind it, the Hall of Perfected Ones to honor the multitude of sages. To the right stood the Cloud Assembly; to the east, the Fragrant Accumulation. Nearby, the abbey walls enclosed six hundred *mu* of fertile fields. They cultivated and protected over a thousand fruit-bearing trees, while cypress and juniper stood dense and solemn, the gates and courtyards serene. Provisions for life’s sustenance were abundant, drawn from the surroundings; in welcoming those who came, they reaped benefits both for themselves and others.",

      "translated_text": "Here the master’s roots were honored, the nation’s blessings cultivated through offerings and rites. Prayers ascended for the celestial chart, supplications rose for the people’s welfare. Clouds and mist settled as the master and perfected ones came and went—thus was he the eastern host of the Dao.\n\nOnce construction was complete, the abbey was named *Abiding Clouds*, for it took its name from the master’s Daoist appellation, hoping never to forget him. The three disciples had fulfilled their duties; following their master, they returned to Bian. Only Li Zhixi remained for years without fail, steadfastly completing the work—a worthy guardian. Master Cui later assisted in fashioning the statues.\n\nIn the spring of the *zhaoyang* year of the *Dayuanxian* cycle, those in service came from afar to pay their respects, entreating me for an inscription to record these events. Duty forbade refusal, so I reluctantly complied, writing plainly:\n\n**Inscription:**\nGreat is the Supreme Dao,\nwithout gate, without side.\nNeither near nor far,\nradiant in all four directions.\nThe sage attains it,\ncherishing it lifelong.\nLaozi’s wellspring flows,\ntransmitted through ten thousand ages.\nIn recent times, Chongyang,\nhis dragon, his light.\nChangchun follows,\nthe true wind ever brighter.\n*Abiding Clouds’* perfect virtue,\nknowing white, guarding black.\nKindness and mercy benefit all,\na model for the world.\nFour disciples, wise and steadfast,\ncarried on the ancestral legacy.\nGathering truth at Guiluo,\nZhu and Ge revived the teachings.\nA jade abode arose,\nsix hundred *mu* of lingzhi fields.\nA thousand jujube trees,\nten thousand vistas to behold.\nMorning incense, evening lamps,\nall good deeds observed.\nHeaven’s blessings descend—\nwhat fortune does not arrive?\n\n**Stele of Abiding Clouds Abbey on Mount Pan**\n\nThe Dao, formless and boundless,\nadvances when embodied in people.\nMountains, high or low,\nare named for the immortals who dwell there.\nThis is the hidden harmony of nature’s principles,\nthe convergence of human affairs.\n\nThe mountains northwest of Yuyang were once called *Four Uprights*. In ancient times, there was a Master Tian Pan—*Tian* being his surname. It is unclear from which era he came from Qi, but he dwelled on this mountain for many years, attaining the Dao and becoming a perfected one. Though hunters, woodcutters, and common folk all revered him, his influence spread far and wide, and the mountain came to be called *Mount Pan* in his honor.\n\nAt the brow of this mountain, beneath the Purple Peak, lay a secluded and joyful vale, bright and upright, known as *Central Pan*—a misty grotto-palace of clouds and mist. Through countless kalpas, it was home to Buddhist monks. Then came the fall of the Jin dynasty, when the fires of calamity raged, valleys shifted, and the land changed hands. Once more, it became a dense forest, a haven for wolves and tigers.\n\nWhen the great dynasty rose in splendor, revering the Dao and virtue, Master Changchun of Abiding Clouds answered the imperial summons. In the first month of the *jiashen* year, he returned to Yanran, establishing the Changchun Abbey. From this, the mystic wind flourished, and the four directions responded in harmony. Daoists and laypeople alike looked up in admiration, and disciples gathered like clouds.\n\nAmong his followers was Master Abiding Cloud, who delved deeply into the profound mysteries and favored the tranquility of forests and springs, letting birds choose his dwelling. His disciples, including Zhang Zhige, in the *gengchen* year, ventured to this mountain. Through overgrown vines and secluded paths, they sought out the old site, finding it perfectly suited to their hearts. Thus, they began construction.\n\nIn the spring of the *xinsi* year, with the approval of Prefect Xu of the province, Master Abiding Cloud was invited to reside on this mountain. He arrived as summoned, and before long, seekers of the Dao flocked to him, their empty departures becoming full returns—so numerous they could not be counted. Beneath his guidance, all were venerable elders of great virtue, their conduct simple and their truth luminous. As disciples multiplied, the abbey took shape.\n\nIn the spring of the *bingxu* year, they petitioned Master Changchun to preside over the Yellow Register Jiao rites. The master then bestowed the name *Abiding Clouds Abbey* upon it. Thereafter, its fame spread in all directions. Later, officials and commoners of the capital entreated him to leave the mountain and reside at the Tianchang Abbey in Yanjing.\n\nIn the autumn of the *dinghai* year, after the master ascended in the clouds, the great teacher led his followers southward. Wherever they passed, transformation followed. Commanderies and counties welcomed them at their outskirts, and new abbeys arose while old ones were restored—too many to count—all overseen by his disciples. Most notably, at the site of Ancestral Master Chongyang’s ascension in the Southern Capital, they devotedly built the Chaoyuan Abbey, grand and magnificent.\n\nMaster Abiding Cloud, in establishing virtue and merit, began at Central Pan and achieved greatness at Liangyuan. His support of the true wind and aid to the mystic teachings were, indeed, products of the era’s prosperity. This record captures but a fraction of the truth, for the master’s legacy defies mere words.\n\nFuture scholars should take heed and strive earnestly.\n\n**Inscription:**\nThe Dao’s essence, vast and formless,\nmanifests through those who embody it.\nMountains, though unequal in height,\nare named for the immortals who grace them.\nThis is the hidden principle of things,\nthe meeting of heaven and human affairs.",

Before reaching his twentieth year, he experienced a sudden awakening—casting off worldly burdens to seek the Mystery and visit masters.\n\nIn the spring of the *dinghai* year of the Dading era (1167), Chongyang arrived from the western lands of Shaanxi in search of kindred spirits. When he first reached Kunqian, the Perfected One heard of him and went to observe. At a single glance, their spirits met, and he took Chongyang as his teacher. Remaining close at his side, he delved into the profound depths of the Twofold Mystery, its truths unfolding day by day.\n\nSoon after, like-minded seekers gathered: Master Danyang Ma, Master Changzhen Tan, Master Changsheng Liu, Master Yuyang Wang, and Master Guangning Hao. These several disciples, sharing the same teacher, forged bonds of fellowship beyond the world, sailing the vast sea of the Complete Perfection teachings. Through the transmission of master and disciple, each embraced the teachings and received their proper inheritance.\n\nBefore long, Chongyang took only Ma, Tan, Liu, and Qiu with him on his travels, their fame spreading across the Four Seas. Later, they went to Bian, lodging at the residence in Yuetai Ward, where he swiftly gathered the other disciples. After some time, Chongyang entrusted his final affairs to Danyang and, without illness, returned to the True.\n\nThe four disciples escorted his spirit back to be interred on Mount Zhongnan. Once the funeral rites were complete, each discussed their paths forward and set their aspirations in different directions. Thus, the Perfected One wandered through Qin and Long, dwelling in humble abodes by streams, a bamboo basket and gourd his only possessions, a straw cloak and hat his constant companions. Self and things alike forgotten, his mind abode in perfect tranquility.\n\nAfter six years, he attained the subtleties—whether in action or stillness, speech or silence, every movement and gesture became an expression of the Dao’s workings. The gate of the Mystery swung open, the celestial treasury unfolded its shoulders; his wisdom-store overflowed, his eloquence poured forth like a boundless spring. A single word from his lips, and people vied to recite it.

      "translated_text": "In the spring of the second month of the *Dading Wushen* year, Emperor Shizong dispatched envoys to summon him to the imperial court, entrusting him with the oversight of the *Wanchun* Offering rites. By special decree, he was granted residence at the Quanzhen Hall. The Emperor received him in audience many times, inquiring about the Way of preserving peace. The Perfected One instructed him in restraining emotions and curbing desires, cultivating *qi* and nurturing the spirit, elucidating the essence of the Dao and virtue, and dissecting the principles of Heaven and humanity. The Emperor was greatly pleased and held him in even higher esteem.\n\nIn the *Mingchang Xinhai* year, he returned to the eastern seas and dwelled at the Taixu Abbey in Bindu, where fellow Daoists all revered him as their master. When disciples sought further instruction, he warned them of the consequences of merit, conduct, sin, and fortune. In his responses to all, he was like water poured into vessels—adapting to their shapes and sizes, filling them just enough. Many among his followers buried themselves among the common folk, some donning coarse clothing and subsisting on simple fare, their aspirations and integrity held in mutual esteem, unknown to the world. Thus, his teachings did not easily spread widely across the land.\n\nAt that time, the imperial court, having risen in accordance with the mandate of Heaven, ruled over the Central Plains. The north and south were newly united, and the Emperor’s virtue and renown reached the highest heavens. In the winter of the tenth month of the *Jimao* year, the Emperor dispatched his trusted envoy Liu Zhonglun with a light cavalry of several dozen, clearing the way to the seashore to convey the imperial summons. The Perfected One, recognizing the will of Heaven, did not refuse and set forth. Eighteen of his foremost disciples from the monastic community accompanied him. They journeyed northwest, braving hardships and dangers, crossing the vast deserts of the Dragon Sands, until they reached the imperial encampment. The Emperor, moved by his sincere devotion to the long journey, received him with profound courtesy.\n\nOne day, the Emperor inquired about the elixir of immortality. The Perfected One replied: *\"There are classics of health preservation, but no elixir of immortality.\"* The Emperor praised his sincerity. Whenever he was summoned to the imperial presence, he urged restraint in killing, moderation in desires, and the virtues of compassion and filial piety. The Emperor commanded his scribes to record his words.\n\nIn the spring of the *Guiwei* year, by special decree, he returned to Yan. There, the Changchun Abbey was constructed, and he was appointed to preside over the Orthodox Daoist teachings, with all the robed and capped of the realm submitting to his authority. He was granted a golden tally, and his disciples traveled by imperial post to deliver memorials and receive audiences. The court exempted them from corvée labor. From then on, the mystic winds flourished, the Dao grew ever more luminous, and the construction of abbeys spread like stars across the sky. Those who came to pay their respects arrived in clouds and mists. The expansion of the teachings was unparalleled in ancient times.\n\nThe Perfected One, having reached advanced age, made his home in Yanshan. He responded to supplications from all directions, and his influence extended near and far. When prayers were offered for clear skies or rain, the answers came as promised—so perfect was the communion between Heaven and humanity that not even a hair’s breadth stood between them.\n\nIn the sixth month of the *Dinghai* year, a great thunderstorm struck. The banks of the Taiye Pond collapsed, and its waters dried up; the cliffs of the northern pass crumbled with a thunderous roar. Upon hearing this, the Master said: *\"The mountain’s collapse and the pond’s desiccation—shall I not follow them?\"* Nine days after the first day of the seventh month in autumn, he indeed manifested his passing. He was eighty-one years old. His sacred remains were interred in the Chushun Hall of the White Cloud Abbey.\n\nIn the *Wuzi* year, his successor, the Perfected One of Pure Harmony, by imperial decree, bestowed upon him the honorific title *Changchun Hongdao Tongmi Perfected One*.\n\nTo speak of the Perfected One’s descent into the world: his virtue was constant, grasping the Mystic Pearl of the Most High and bearing the Dharma Seal of Chongyang. His resolve was firm as metal and stone, his nature pure as ice and frost. He dissolved the dusty passions of kalpas past and shattered the karmic obstructions of many lives. A numinous breeze brushed his sleeves, the moon of his nature hung in the sky. His great illumination reached the roots, trunks, springs, and sources, spreading like waves and branches. Knowing the constant, he abided in stillness; returning to destiny, he attained emptiness. The Golden Elixir was perfected, the fruits of fire-jujubes and frost-pears ripened. His spiritual powers were free and unobstructed, his responses to change boundless. He embodied the great completeness of Heaven and Earth, restored the great essence of antiquity and the present. He wandered without weariness, standing alone in solitary transformation. This is how the Perfected One perfected himself and became the great master of the world.\n\nWhen the Dao resides in a place, all things naturally gravitate toward it. Harmonious *qi* flowed everywhere, reaching even the most distant realms. He oversaw the construction of abbeys and the establishment of teachings, revering the honored ones beyond form and expounding the mysteries within the Dao. He pointed to the celestial Perfected and opened the path, ferrying souls across the sea of suffering as a boat and oar. Those who ascended it would surely attain enlightenment; those who practiced it would surely reach the goal. All who had feet longed to follow him onto the Way. This is how the Perfected One propagated transformation and guided the lost, upholding the true teachings.\n\nIn the early days of the imperial dynasty, when the celestial armies first tested their strength, blood flowed like rivers, and flesh filled the hills and plains. At the wave of a yellow banner, corpses lay for ten thousand *li*; where the horses’ hooves trod, no land was left untouched; where blades fell, no people remained. Jade and stone burned together, metal and boiling water turned to dust. Fortunately, the Perfected One answered the imperial summons and journeyed to the encampment. His subtle words were heard again, and Heaven’s will turned back. Those who submitted were spared execution; those who surrendered their cities were granted mercy. He counseled generals to cherish life and urged the powerful to aid the people. In crises, he rescued them by many means; for captives, he ransomed them with wealth. Fugitive servants who followed the Dao were pardoned; menial laborers who advanced in virtue were freed. He saved lives from the depths of suffering and snatched them from the edge of blades, turning the wicked toward goodness—all through the vast propagation of the Dao’s transformation. Many in the world benefited from his protection, though some remained unaware. Though he benefited the world, he never spoke of his beneficence. Such was the Perfected One: his virtue transformed Heaven and Earth, his nature transcended the emperors of old.\n\nSome, misled by what they heard or saw, presumed to measure him, but they grasped only the superficial. His traces were not his essence. What lay behind his traces was beyond the ken of the wisest or the eloquence of the most articulate—like wearing the sky on one’s head without knowing its height, or treading the earth without knowing its vastness. Those who presumed to measure him were like the blind groping at shadows.\n\nMaster Li, having come from afar, commanded this record of the Perfected One’s deeds. It shall be engraved in stone to preserve his legacy, a repayment of the debt owed to one’s honored teacher. Duty forbade refusal, so I have followed his request, fasting and purifying myself before inscribing these words.\n\nIts inscription reads:",

Whatever he undertook to repair or restore, he vigorously supported. Having long shared a bond like brothers with Master Ru, upon hearing of the Master’s admonitions, he honored and trusted him deeply, embracing his teachings in word and deed. The worthy and the wicked alike followed him, and he released over a thousand families of captives—surely a sign of his enlightened understanding.\n\nMaster Ru, whose given name was Zhijiu, bore the surname Ru. A native of Quanzhou, he had pursued the Dao from youth, studying under the True Man Lou Yun for many years. He mastered its profound mysteries and traveled widely with staff and sandals, journeying west to Jiyang. In the *bingxu* year, elders invited him to reside at Qizhen Abbey. In the *guisi* year, Marshal Tian invited him to dwell at Yingxiang Abbey in Jingzhao. Soon after, he came to the village of the Xiahou clan, where he surveyed the surroundings—pristine and surpassingly fine. Once a retreat for renowned scholars and enlightened gentlemen to wander and gather truth, it had fallen to neglect, overrun by the howls of foxes, hares, and wolves. He thus chose a secluded spot, clearing away the brambles and broken tiles to mark its bounds. The inner and outer fields, measured by the *mu*, totaled two hundred and eighty, and he established a deed to define their limits.\n\nThere Master Ru built his abode, constructing a hall for the Perfected, a sanctuary for the True, and chambers for quiet retreat, arranged as circumstances allowed—sufficient to lodge the pure and refined. With solemn devotion, he performed rites of purification, reverently pledging his faith to the True, offering prayers for the imperial reign, and repaying the boundless grace of the throne. At the completion of the sanctuary, he sought an inscription from his master, who named it *Qinghua* (\"Pure Splendor\").\n\nIn the fourth month of the *renzi* year’s summer, the True Man of Perpetual Constancy, bearing the imperial mandate, journeyed to offer sacrifices at the famous mountains and great rivers.

      "translated_text": "Amidst emerald forests and jade-like peaks, the visage of Fengyuan stands revealed. Beholding the sun’s pure radiance, one inquires into the misty haze. Profoundly penetrating to bone and spirit, it stills and sweeps away the mind’s deceits. Clouds and rosy dawns lead the chorus, jade laughter their refrain. Here one wanders, here one abides, finding peace and repose. The dwelling is a singular chamber, its structure pivoting on a central axis. The numinous gate bears no lock, the cavernous portal no bar. Thus is it made the lotus hut of those who attain the Dao, a place where perfected immortals come and go.\n\n*Stele Inscription of the Great Fast by Huang Ju of Biling*\n\nThe Dao moves and gives rise to qi; qi transforms and gives rise to form. Forms vary in magnitude and subtlety, manifesting as flying and hidden, moving and still, growing and withering. The movement of qi entails ascent and descent, waxing and waning, birth and extinction, decay and flourishing. Like the revolving of the ten thousand images, it knows no beginning nor end; like the succession of the four seasons, it is neither ancient nor modern. Such is the constant principle of Heaven, the inexhaustible treasury of the Creator.\n\nYet when the turning of qi brings renewal and change, when the cycles of time reach their end and begin anew, none may remain passive and await fate, nor submit without resistance. When the moment is ripe, men hasten to seize it by force; when the moment has passed, they cling to their losses and contend by force. Thus do corpses lie for a thousand miles, the slain fill the cities—some perish by blade and arrow, some by wood and stone, some by fire and water—throughout the ages without respite, year upon year without cease. The plains are sated with human flesh, the rivers and valleys run with human blood, for they have defied Heaven and gone against the times.\n\nFrom the Tang and Wu dynasties onward, at every dynastic transition, it has ever been thus. Since the august founding of the Great Dynasty, when the Jin lost its mandate, warfare has known no end, continuing to this day for nearly forty years. Wherever the hooves of warhorses tread, golden ramparts crumble to dust; wherever blades descend, men and things are reduced to ashes. Valleys become hills, south becomes north, households are exterminated, ten gates stand nine empty, and even the solitary survivor finds no escape. Those who narrowly escape execution linger in lonely misery, their breath faint; those whose clans are annihilated and lineages severed spend their years in desolate searching. To whom may they appeal? Their hearts grow cold in vain.\n\nBeyond the Yellow River’s flow, at the borders of the battlefield, peril is greater still. Souls are trapped, spirits bound, enduring long kalpas without release—only through the merit of the Mysterious may they find deliverance. Now, by the grace of the fast’s sponsors, certain officials and others, great compassion has arisen, and the highest good has been set in motion. At this abbey, they have established the Great Fast of the Primordial Yellow Register, making offerings to the Three Pure Ones of Jade Clarity and all the sagely hosts. Ascension to immortality stands opposite deliverance of souls, marking the divergence of good and evil paths; the Southern Palace borders the Northern Bureau, revealing the distinction between immortals and mortals. The altar is purified, its precincts arrayed in solemn order, to invite the descent of perfected transcendents and beseech their radiant aid.\n\nThey have further invited the Perfected One of Resting Clouds from the Court of Primordial Harmony in the Southern Capital to oversee the fast’s proceedings. Their intent is to deliver the unclaimed orphaned souls of this region, as well as the lingering spirits of ancestors from various families—those with kin but no means—attaching their names to the register and summoning their souls. It is hoped that filial sons and dutiful grandsons, mindful of their clans and ancestors, will each offer their sincerest devotion and gaze upon the true sages. Incense, flowers, lamps, and candles serve as the luminous radiance of wisdom; the stars and constellations of the altar ground become the realm of the Tuṣita Heaven. May all—whether their mouths [are sealed] or [words remain]—share in this grace; may all who have sunk into decay and desiccation be revived.\n\nAscending the compassionate vessel, the sorrows of the unseen and the seen alike are resolved; all receive deliverance, and blessings flow anew. May the ancestral line ascend in transcendence. Above, may the imperial realm stand firm forever, the sagely virtue ever renewed; may the frontiers know peace, soldiers and people rejoice in their livelihood. May the ten directions and three realms, the six paths and four modes of birth, the sentient and the insentient, all partake of the Dao’s blessing.\n\nNow this sacred altar is prepared in purity, the rites conducted with solemnity. A brief account of these events is set down here and inscribed in stone.\n\n*Yunshan Collection, Volume Seven concluded*\n*Yunshan Collection, Volume Eight: Stele Inscriptions*",

      "translated_text": "Stele Inscription for the Capital Salvation Ritual\nComposed by Perceiver of the Constant Dao, Ji Zhizhen\n\nIn the winter of the *jiwei* year, the tenth month, the Eighth Subordinate Officer of the Western Freezing Prefecture’s Crown Prince’s Court, having long cherished a vow, undertook the supreme Yellow Register Offering. At the Yingxiang Abbey of this prefecture, from spring through autumn, halls and chambers were repaired and refurbished, and the ritual altar was prepared. Without hesitation, the Perching Cloud Perfected was invited to serve as the Great Master of Salvation, presiding over the ritual assembly.\n\nOn the appointed day, Daoist adepts were summoned, ritual implements arranged, and documents dispatched to announce the event to the Illuminated Perfected of the Three Realms and the deities above and below. With fasting, purification, and concentrated thought, the rites were conducted to shelter all beings.\n\nThree days prior, the ceremonial observances commenced with reverent offerings to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. The intent was to deliver both the distant and recently deceased of the ancestral line, as well as the orphaned souls of the realm with none to claim them, including those from families lacking proper sacrifices, who came to the altar to be included in the rites. From this to that, none were near or distant—all relied upon the incense and cultivation, universally praying for transcendence.\n\nThus, the Dao was practiced for three days and two nights. At dawn on the day following the full moon, the altar was dispersed, and the rites concluded. Such wholehearted devotion was an expression of benevolence and filial piety.\n\nTo speak of it: Heaven and Earth share one *qi*, and all things and self share a single root. As the myriad transformations ebb and flow, forms are arrayed and distinctions made. Interwoven with the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Phases, governed by the cyclical progression of the Four Seasons, change renews daily, and transformation knows no end—such is the constant movement of *qi*. Yet, once a form is received, it is grasped as one’s own possession. Thus, beings contend with blades and opposition, giving rise to strength and weakness, rise and fall, ceasing only in death.\n\nLittle do they realize that *qi* is what they serve, time what they follow, fate what they abide, and principle what they inhabit. Every stirring and arising has a beginning and an end. Gain and loss, survival and extinction—these are the creations of Heaven. Who can resist them? Those who act against them fail; those who cling to them lose; those who oppose them perish; those who comply with them flourish. Those who contend with cunning are exhausted; those who contend with force are defeated. Indeed, humanity’s inability to overcome Heaven has long been so.\n\nNow, the imperial dynasty responds to the mandate, encompassing all within the Central Plains. From the northern deserts to the southern Han lands, from the Eastern Sea to the Western Freezing regions, diverse paths and disparate ways have all been unified. There is no second Dao in the world, no divided hearts within the realm. The past’s warfare and slaughter have been fully endured; the extinction of ancestral sacrifices has been fully witnessed. Comparing past and present, not one in ten thousand remains. Comparing oneself to others, one’s own body enjoys peace and fortune, branches and leaves flourish, with human rank as a companion and Heaven’s protection as a bestowal.\n\nReflecting on one’s own good fortune, one thinks of the world’s misfortune; reflecting on one’s own kin, one pities those without kin. Sharing *qi* and root, how can one not be moved? Thus, the long-cherished vow was fulfilled, the sincere heart laid bare. Relying on the Primordial’s compassion to save beings, the great Yellow Register Fast was initiated. Invoking the universal power of the Perfected, one hoped for the illumination of the Three Realms, shining a single torch into the dark underworld to open the paths of the nether regions.\n\nGathering and guiding the myriad *qi*, long-sunken souls were returned to their source; harmonizing the hundred spirits, orphaned souls were all uplifted. Together, they rode the harmonious *qi*, subtly aiding the imperial enterprise. With the written word and military might unified, the myriad regions complied with transformation, and the Four Seas returned to benevolence—this was the utmost wish of a minister and child.\n\nThe offering altar was prepared in purity, the ritual conducted with solemnity. This inscription was carved in stone to record the merit, that it might endure forever. Facts were gathered and recorded truthfully.",

unrecognized—\nLost in boundless, unfathomable darkness—\nHow can this not be a cause for profound sorrow?\n\nThus, the filial heart never forgets;\nLonging to repay the root of one’s being,\nIts boundless grace moves one to tears of blood and wounded sorrow.\nWithout the merit of profound cultivation,\nBy what means can one deliver them?\n\nOne must therefore offer utmost sincerity and reverence,\nLaying bare the depths of one’s heart,\nPraying to the exalted Perfected Ones,\nHoping for their merciful deliverance,\nThat the departed souls may transcend suffering,\nNever again to encounter the realms of torment—\nSuch is the principle of resonant response.\n\nOn this day, so-and-so offers this rite for the deliverance of their late parents,\nOn this appointed day of the month,\nA grand Yellow Register fast is solemnly conducted,\nWith offerings presented to the sacred ranks.\nA certain master is invited to preside over the jiao rites,\nAnd the divine altar’s pure assembly is commanded to present memorials and petitions,\nFollowing the prescribed liturgy.\n\nThe ritual begins with the issuance of documents on such-and-such a day,\nAnd concludes with the burning of the memorial on such-and-such a day.\nHaving gathered for this assembly,\nAll approach the sacred altar with purity,\nPouring forth the sincerity of their hearts,\nUnited in their prayers for deliverance—\nSuch is the utmost devotion of filial children and benevolent persons.\n\nWith solemn dignity in place and the rites conducted in strict order,\nThe sincerity of repaying one’s roots is fittingly inscribed in stone,\nTo be witnessed by future generations.\nThis also serves as an encouragement to virtue in turn.\n\nIts inscription reads:\nIn serving one’s parents,\nEven in death, one attends them as in life.\nWith a single offering,\nTears of blood express one’s sincerity.\nThe spirits of parents,\nDwell in the unseen.\nLonging to repay their roots,\nOne fulfills heaven’s constant principle.\n\nApproaching this jade palace,\nThe realm of the Jade Clarity,\nPraying with purity,\nAll turbid qi is dispelled.\nThe Perfected gather like spokes to a hub,\nAll the sages unite in covenant.\nClouds and mist converge,\nThe master’s virtue is fully realized.\nCompassionate clouds and dharma rain,\nResound like thunder and lightning.\nWithin the refining fire altar,\nKarmic burdens are burned away, and souls ascend.\n\n**Stele of Nanchang Abbey**\n\nThe Dao does not discard anything,\nAnd nothing exists outside the Dao.\nIt permeates all within the six directions,\nUniting the vast and the minute in all existence—\nNothing is excluded.\n\nThus, heaven attains it and becomes clear,\nEarth attains it and becomes tranquil,\nThe Three Luminaries attain it and shine,\nThe Four Seasons attain it and turn in harmony,\nAnd the sages attain it to establish teachings for the world.\n\nIt is the uncarved block of the nameless,\nDescending to become the guiding master of transformation.\nIts wondrous workings flourish,\nIts divine power shines forth.\nWhen the wellspring of the numinous is unleashed,\nIt rightly steadies the raging currents.\nThough its manifestations vary with the times,\nIt adapts to the rise and fall of the world.\n\nThe Dao neither increases nor diminishes,\nYet its application waxes and wanes.\nSince the dawn of creation,\nThrough the primordial chaos, its origins are unrecorded.\nFrom the middle antiquity onward,\nIts exponents have arisen in succession.\n\nIn the time of Fuxi, there was Yuhua Zi;\nIn the time of Shennong, Dacheng Zi;\nIn the time of the Yellow Emperor, Guangcheng Zi;\nIn the time of Zhuanxu, Chijing Zi;\nIn the time of Gaoxin, Lutu Zi;\nUnder Yao, there was Wucheng Zi;\nUnder Shun, Yinshou Zi;\nUnder Yu, Zhenxing Zi;\nUnder Tang, Xize Zi.\n\nThese persons and their virtues,\nAll emerged from the classics and traditions of the Dao,\nServing as imperial teachers across generations.\nTheir profound influence rippled like great waves,\nExtending even to the humblest beings,\nAll recorded in the sacred canon.\n\nYet some, though their names faded from memory,\nLeft behind only faint traces—\nTheir deeds beyond all reckoning.\n\nIn the eras of Yin and Zhou,\nLaozi emerged.\nHe blunted sharpness and resolved entanglements,\nResponding to circumstances with transformation.\nReturning to the utmost emptiness and profound stillness,\nHe expounded on governing people and serving heaven.\nThe preservation of his two chapters and four supplements,\nAlongside the teachings of the Hundred Schools,\nWas like a forest of jade vying in splendor,\nOr orchids and friends competing in fragrance.\n\nThose with hearts like frost and snow,\nClad in coarse robes yet holding jade within;\nThose who wore star-crowned hats and moon sashes,\nCarrying double baskets on their shoulders—\nThe branches of scriptures and diagrams,\nThe proliferation of codes and canons,\nThe brewing of jade nectar and elixirs,\nThe ingestion of five metals and eight minerals,\nSome refined their forms and circulated qi,\nOthers exhaled the old and inhaled the new,\nWarding off evil and expelling demons,\nEmploying talismans to govern spirits.\n\nThese were urgent practices for worldly adaptation and bodily nurturance,\nAll auxiliary to the Dao,\nYet not the Dao itself.\nIn their pursuit of returning to the root and restoring life’s mandate,\nThey often overlooked its essence.\n\nIn recent times, Chongyang,\nHeaven-endowed and divinely appointed,\nCast off worldly entanglements and relinquished dust,\nEstablishing the root and source of the trunk,\nSweeping away the waves and branches.\nHe aided the present with purity and truth,\nResponding with gentleness, humility, and modesty.\nHe embodied the great completeness of heaven and earth,\nAnd perfected the grand essence of past and present.\n\nThe Dao was transmitted to several disciples by the Eastern Sea,\nAll of whom embraced and propagated it,\nResponding to the call and harmonizing in song,\nTransforming the world.\n\nBy the early reign of the sagely ancestor of the imperial dynasty,\nBoth Dao and virtue were revered;\nAfter the summoning of Master Changchun,\nThe gates of the tradition were widely opened.\nWithin the chambers, seats were never empty,\nAnd shoes filled the thresholds outside.\nWhen the succeeding master, Qinghe Zhenren, assumed the role of grand preceptor,\nHe was honored with the imperial mandate,\nReceiving dignitaries and welcoming disciples.\nAbbeys stood in sight of one another,\nAnd even in distant frontiers, deep mountains, and vast marshes,\nThere were always those who followed the path.\n\nTo the north of this pavilion,\nLess than a league away,\nLies a hamlet called Tunzhu,\nAnd within this prosperous village stands Nanchang Abbey.\nIt was founded by Master Baoguang,\nWhose surname was Zhu and given name Zhiming,\nA native of this land,\nBaoguang being his Daoist name.\n\nIn his prime, he was exceptionally perceptive,\nRenouncing the secular to pursue the Dao.\nHe studied under Master Baoyang, Liu Zhifu,\nA foremost disciple of the Great Ancient Perfected One.\nThe master personally guided him,\nTransforming him day by day and month by month,\nUntil he received the seal of transmission.\n\nIn middle age, he returned to his parents’ homeland,\nSurveying his former residence,\nOnly to find it overgrown and desolate,\nLittle more than its foundations remaining.\nThe master led his disciples to reclaim the wasteland,\nClearing paths and cultivating the wilds,\nAcquiring land measured in acres, half a qing in total.\nWhen the prefectural lord, Magistrate Zhang, granted an official document to authorize it,\nThey began construction—\nRaising beams, erecting walls,\nPlanning and building—\nAnd in less than ten days,\nThe great work was accomplished.\n\nA hall was dedicated to the Most High,\nA meeting hall for the purchase of blessings,\nWhere the pure countenance of the Perfected could be venerated,\nFulfilling the deepest wishes of the people.\nOfferings were made with reverence at dawn,\nAnd incense burned steadfastly at dusk.",

blessings as wings he sustained it,\nWith virtue as carriage he bore it.\nIn wandering or dwelling, in rest or sleep,\nHe never forgot his devout cultivation.\n\nFor the emperor’s longevity he prayed,\nThat earth endure and heaven last long.\nFor the people’s fortune he entreated,\nWith boundless abundance and blessings.\nMorning and evening, with earnest devotion,\nA single incense burned in the hearth.\n\n*An Encounter with a True Record: The Story of Chaoyun of Qin*\n\nThere was a man named Chaoyun of Qin,\nHis clan and homeland unknown.\nTo escape the corvée of Qin Shi Huang’s

and human traces could not reach—\nOnly then did he stop.\n\nHe ate from the trees and drank from the streams,\nUntil he came upon a dense forest of thickets,\nWhere he built a nest and dwelt above,\nHence his name, Chaoyun—Nest Cloud.\n\nThis man,\nOnce entangled in the world’s clamor and constraint,\nShed its burdensome ties,\nBreaking free from its snares like a fleeing hare.\nWith trees and rocks as neighbors,\nDeer and boars as companions,\nHe escaped the suffering of human servitude and oppression,\nLiving freely and unrestrained,\nVowing to spend his life thus.\n\nLong accustomed to emptiness and stillness,\nHe passed days and months in quietude,\nFinding them ever longer;\nWalking amidst clouds and mist beyond the world,\nHe could not contain his joy.\nRecalling the past,\nAmid the tumult of clamoring crowds,\nBraving the suffocating yellow dust,\nIt was as if trapped in a searing furnace or boiling cauldron,\nSteamed and scorched—\nWho could describe such torment?\n\nNow,\nThough he trod paths where jackals and tigers roamed,\nClimbed cliffs where apes and monkeys dwelled,\nCut off from the world,\nWhat else could he seek?\nOnly to attain ease and tranquility,\nTo avoid disturbing the natural course of life.\n\nWhether walking or standing,\nSitting or lying,\nHe would pause and gaze around:\nThe mountains, silent;\nThe waters, clear and cold.\nBirds sang in harmony,\nBeasts grew tame and familiar.\nGrasses and trees vied in beauty,\nPeaks and ridges competed in grandeur—\nHe deemed Penglai’s paradise,\nThe Jasper Pool’s fairyland,\nThe grotto-heavens and celestial palaces,\nNone could surpass this.\n\nAt times,\nBeneath pine shadows and grassy paths,\nHair unbound, he sang as he walked;\nAt the forest’s edge or by the stream,\nHis solitary form danced with its shadow—\nSuch was his joy.\n\nAfter years of dwelling here,\nWorldly cares vanished entirely.\nHe knew not whether the world had turned to Han or Wei,\nNor whether his own fleeting form\nWas a thing or himself.\n\nHe loathed yellow essence,\nFeared the allure of green herbs,\nDrank from pure springs,\nSat upon white stones.\nHis form dissolved into reverie,\nAs if in a light slumber.\n\nThen,\nAn aged immortal appeared—\nYouthful temples, square pupils,\nA fine beard, hair coiled in a topknot—\nHolding a sprig of lingzhi,\nTreading auspicious clouds,\nHe descended beside him.\nPointing, he called out:\n“You, who are infatuated with mountains and forests,\nEnamored of springs and stones,\nDiffer little from those who lose themselves in the dusty world.\nHaving long delighted in stillness,\nSorrow and movement must follow.\nI now bestow upon you the nameless simplicity to anchor it,\nThat you may break free from the bonds of stillness\nAnd ascend beyond Kunlun’s peak.\nDo you desire this?”\n\nChaoyun rose abruptly,\nBowed deeply, and pressed his forehead to the ground,\nThen crawled forward on his knees:\n“Dare I ask the method?”\n\nThe old immortal commanded him to sit in silence,\nClose his eyes and cover his ears.\nThen, with a sharp blade, he split his chest and removed his heart,\nBefore sealing it again,\nApplying a divine medicine.\n“Nameless simplicity,\nThe seed of immortals and sages,\nNow rests within your breast.\nGuard it well.”\n\nThereafter,\nChaoyun entered a profound void,\nA deep obscurity—\nHe knew not how or why,\nOnly that it was so.\n\nAfter a long while,\nAs if awakening from sleep,\nOr sobering from drunkenness,\nHe looked around—\nThe old immortal was gone.\nHe touched his chest—\nIt was whole, as before.\nSuddenly,\nHe felt hollow and refreshed,\nHis spirit bright and clear,\nHarmonious qi spreading throughout,\nHis entire being at peace.\nAn inner celestial light shone forth,\nRevealing his innate purity.\n\nThen,\nAs if newly awakened,\nHe felt vast and unbound,\nThe breadth of the sea could not compare to his greatness,\nThe leisure of clouds and waters could not match his ease.\nHe passed through the mysterious barrier,\nHis wisdom treasury now lucid,\nAttaining the sight of no-seeing,\nThe knowledge of unknowing.\n\nMerging with heaven and earth in primordial chaos,\nHarmonizing with the myriad things as one,\nThere was no other, no self.\nWithin and without, vast and deep,\nAll was one body, all-pervading.\nGreat and small, coarse and fine,\nAll were contained in a single nature.\n\nThen,\nHe danced and leapt,\nChanting soundless poems,\nPlaying a flute without holes,\nStrumming a zither without strings,\nSinging a song of no-birth—\nIts resonance shook heaven and earth,\nYet the world never heard it.\n\nThus,\nDragon roars and phoenix cries,\nCranes dancing, simurghs soaring,\nTreading the void, riding the wind,\nCommanding qi—\nAll could be done,\nAnd could not but be done.\n\nAfter dwelling in the mountains for many years,\nWoodcutters and hunters occasionally glimpsed his strangeness.\nHis fame could not be concealed,\nPaths gradually formed,\nAnd one or two seekers of the Dao came to visit.\n\nThere was a scholar, Rong Bohua,\nWho, hearing of Chaoyun’s reputation,\nBraved rugged terrain to see him.\nAccompanied by several others,\nUpon arrival, they saw Chaoyun’s withered, mountain-worn form\nAnd reproached him:\n“A true man’s breast cradles brocade,\nHis spirit exhales rainbows,\nHe stands above all things,\nHis grace nourishes even the grasses.\nHe builds great deeds,\nAttains great renown,\nWalks the golden halls,\nSounds the jade chimes.\nAmong birds, he is the phoenix;\nAmong beasts, the dragon.\nBetter to be the beak of a chicken\nThan the rump of an ox—\nThis is the shared desire of all.\nYet you alone, so despondent and cramped,\nCower in these deep mountains and barren valleys,\nScarcely better than a well-frog or ditch-turtle.\nHow can you bear such indignity?”\n\nChaoyun lifted his head, sighed to the heavens,\nAnd slowly replied:\n“Have you not seen\nBetween heaven and earth,\nThe flow of a single qi,\nThe opening and closing of yin and yang,\nThe transformations of clouds and rain,\nThe illumination of sun and moon,\nThe stirring of wind and thunder,\nThe life and death of frost and dew?\nEach serves its purpose differently—\nAll arise from heaven and tend upward.”",

Pengzu, the early death of Yanling,\nThe wealth of Chong, the poverty of Xian—\nAll are fixed by their inherent divisions.\nViewed through the Dao,\nAll forms and numbers, fleeting as they are,

emotions,\nThree poisons, five impurities,\nCountless delusions and evils—\nAll harm the spirit.\nWhen spirit is harmed, it departs;\nWhen spirit departs, the body perishes;\nWhen the body perishes,

brightness is never harmed and remains constant.\nIf the heart seeks to be useful,\nEyes see without seeing,\nEars hear without hearing,\nMouth speaks without speaking,\nNose smells without smelling,\nHands grasp without grasping,\nFeet walk without walking—\nAll limbs and senses become unruly,\nLike one afflicted with wind-stroke or paralysis.\nBut when the heart is useless, the body
