  "full_translation": "**The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register*. Compiled by Zhu Quan of the Ming. Two scrolls, nineteen chapters. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Preface to The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register**\n\nHow magnificent! How resplendent!\n\nI say: the world has extraordinary men who accomplish extraordinary deeds. Without them, who could fathom the profound mysteries of the celestial Dao or plumb the abyssal depths of its source? Breaking through white clouds, grasping the azure vine, ascending emerald peaks, scaling layered ridges, traversing perilous cliffs of ten thousand fathoms, and climbing the summit of Mount Tai—looking down upon the earth below, one may deem oneself lofty. Yet who knows that riding the celestial winds as lightly as goose down, treading the rainbow as though straddling a blue dragon, roaming beyond the Great Void, touching the sun and moon, grasping the stars, licking the azure heavens, and gazing down upon the dusty world—how vast is such a spirit!\n\nUnless one chews the blossoms of the Three Spirits, inhales the radiance of the Nine Lights, rinses the mouth with purple jade’s richness, and savors the true essence of primordial qi, how could one wander the spirit through the mysterious gate, ride the luminous winds of Langfeng, tread the azure void, and expound the celestial Dao?\n\nNow, the composition of this book is like a divine chariot emerging from the vast sea or the rising sun dispelling the darkest night. It can cleanse the vulgarity of worldly dust and adorn the divine splendor of Mount Taihua. Thus, fixing the mind upon the numinous realm, one explores the Supreme Dao at the Celestial Ford; silently aligning with the Great Mystery, one grasps the divine pivot at the Purple Ultimate. For years, I have daily traced the sacred mysteries of the Perfected and probed the pivot of creation’s workings.\n\nHerein, I dissect the unformed chaos before the division of heaven and earth, incise the primordial vastness before the Prior Heaven, reveal the hidden mechanisms of the Great Bird before its manifestation, and clarify the inception of the Great Simplicity in the generation of beings. From the undifferentiated state before the separation of the dark and light, down to the first emergence of human culture, since the establishment of the Daoist teachings—when the Three August Ones founded the ultimate principle and the Five Emperors received the mandate of heaven—those who revered the Dao and cultivated the celestial Dao: their teachings’ affairs were incomplete, their profound words unproclaimed, their institutions untransmitted, their rituals unrectified. I have therefore examined and renewed them. If not I, then who could accomplish this?\n\nThus, after thrice bathing and purifying, I pledged before the divine luminaries and reported to the Heavenly Thearch. I extensively consulted the classical texts, delved into every category, and thoroughly investigated all matters. Greatly proclaiming the mysterious transformation, I elucidated the initial separation of heaven and earth, the first division of creation, the inception of the Dao’s lineage, the forms of ritual, the preparation of implements, the systems of robes and crowns, rites and music, the profound mysteries of the celestial mind, and the regulations of the Daoist gate’s decorum. All were established as fixed standards. Whatever the Daoist gate employs is recorded in this book.\n\nThus, I name it *The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register*.\n\nFrom the beginning of creation to the present day, across hundreds of millions of years, all who have possessed states or households have revered the celestial Dao above and cultivated human affairs below. Therefore, they built the Circular Mound to sacrifice to heaven and erected the Square Mound to offer to earth—all esteeming the celestial Dao. In every imperial decree, it is said: “Reverently following the mandate of heaven.” The *Book of Zhou* states: “Heaven above bestows its mandate.” The *Book of Tang* says: “The enlightened king reverently follows the celestial Dao.” Never has there been a time when the celestial Dao was not revered and the celestial mandate not received.\n\nAlas! The mysterious wind has long been in decline.\n\nThus did I command the Dao’s ocean to surge its waves anew, stirring the mighty billows that strike the heavens; the divine radiance flared suddenly, once more dispelling the deep gloom of distant realms. Truly, one who gazes upon the towering waves that meet the sky does not seek their rise from a mere stagnant pool; one who beholds the vast and profound brush of the mysterious scribe does not expect it from the pedantry of mere phrases.\n\nHow could I dare to boast of myself? This book, rather, is like the thunderous roar that summons wind and storm, lashing the Azure Dragon to unleash the season’s rains; in its proclamation of the Dao, it soars through the celestial vault, riding the Yellow Crane to ascend the luminous void. In its system of rites, it is as though the numinous flute resounds in the cinnabar heavens; in its fashioning of things, it is as though the divine terrace bursts forth upon the Silver River. How magnificent is this renewal of the mysterious creation!\n\nTherefore, I have entrusted it to the printing blocks, that all under heaven and future generations may know the greatness of the Heavenly August Dao to be as splendid as this—is this not wondrous indeed?\n\nWritten on the ninth day of the first month in the ninth year of the *Zhengtong* reign of the second *jiazi* cycle of the August Ming, by the South Polar Elder of Remote Longevity, the Emaciated Immortal.\n\n*Composed by the South Polar Elder of Remote Longevity, the Emaciated Immortal, of the Primal Dao.*\n\nThe Emaciated Immortal says: Tracing the origins of the Daoist teachings, in the primordial chaos of antiquity, when the human Dao first emerged, the Mandate of Heaven was not yet complete. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, inheriting the destiny of the Nine August Ones, rode the six dragons to govern the heavens, established the celestial pole on behalf of Heaven, and thereby fixed the Three Powers.\n\nAt that time, Heaven and Earth had not yet become luminous and distinct. There were no written characters, so knotted cords served in place of governance; no houses, so nests and caves became dwellings; no clothing, so bound grasses covered the body; no vessels, so cupped hands held water for drinking. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, first created written characters, fashioned garments, built palaces, and crafted utensils—thus were the affairs of humanity made complete.\n\nNow, among the Nine Schools and within the Three Teachings, the written characters in use, the clothing worn, the houses inhabited, and the vessels employed all originated with the Yellow Emperor’s innovations—all derived from the teachings of our Daoist school and the Yellow Emperor. Moreover, Laozi said: That which gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things must itself have a source. He declared: “I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao, and forcefully style it the Great—thus it is called the Great Dao.” Its teaching is called Daoism, and from this the world first received the name “Dao.”\n\nBy this reasoning, all who speak of cultivating the Dao or studying the Dao are but appropriating Laozi’s words to take “Dao” as their name—are they not disciples of Laozi’s lineage? Furthermore, Laozi’s words—“mysterious and yet more mysterious, the gateway to all wonders”—the very terms “mysterious” and “wondrous” were borrowed from revered names and employed in the scriptures, all using Laozi’s language.\n\nAgain, in the writings of Zhuangzi it is said: “Only after the Great Awakening does one know the sage.” The name “Great Awakening” was established by Zhuangzi, and later Emperor Huizong of Song took it to bestow the title “Golden Immortal,” using it throughout his scriptures—all derived from the books of our Daoist school and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn ancient times, the Earl of the West attended Laozi with two youths, to whom Laozi gave the names “Auspicious” and “As-You-Will.” Later generations have all used these names, appropriating Laozi’s words—are they not disciples of Laozi’s lineage?\n\nThe teachings of the Yellow Emperor were to create and regulate all things to manifest the Dao of Heaven, serving as the foundation of governance. The Emperor himself declared: “To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection.” As seen in the *Classic of the Yin Confluence*.\n\nThe teachings of Laozi, according to the *Er Ya* and the *Treatise on Arts and Letters*, were to “embrace purity and emptiness to guard the self, and maintain humility and weakness to sustain the body.” This is the art of the ruler facing south. It aligns with Yao and Shun’s virtue of yielding, and the *Book of Changes’* principle of modesty. “One act of modesty brings fourfold benefit”—this is its strength. Thus, to regard the state as one’s own body, and govern the state as one governs the self, is to “value the self above all under Heaven.” Only when one can entrust the self to the world may one be entrusted with the world—all these are the principles of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world pacification. As seen in the *Dao De Jing*, these are the Dao of China’s sages. Hence, it is called the *Orthodox Dao*.\n\nWhat is the Orthodox Dao? China, dwelling at the center of Heaven and Earth, receives the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Its people possess upright forms and upright voices. Their teachings do not employ foreign speech; they dare not speak unless it is the language of the former kings. Thus, there are no words of translation or false attribution. Their attire is not foreign; they dare not wear anything but the lawful garments of the former kings. What they wear are the robes and crowns of the Yellow Emperor, hence the title “Yellow-Crowned.” They do not mutilate their bodies, for “the body, hair, and skin are received from one’s parents and must not be harmed”—this is the beginning of filial piety. Those who attain the Dao ascend in broad daylight, soaring to Heaven to glorify their parents—this is the ultimate filial piety. They do not abandon their surnames, nor forget their kin, nor erase their ancestors—this is the filial duty of a child. In court, they observe proper decorum, practicing the rites of ruler and minister. As ministers, they serve the Supreme Emperor—this is the righteousness of a subject. They study the books of the sages and follow the Dao of the sages, adhering to ritual and righteousness. The principles of Confucianism and Daoism are one.\n\nThis Dao existed before the separation of Heaven and Earth, and its teachings were established in the era of the Three Sovereigns. It is not what Confucius meant when he said that later ages would have only recorders, and that heterodoxies would arise to distort the great principles. Among its followers, those of China are ranked above, while foreigners are ranked below. The teachings have distinctions of precedence, and people have divisions between Chinese and barbarians, as well as differences in nobility and baseness.\n\nAmong the Jurchen women who cultivate the Dao, they do not leave their chambers, do not gather in temples, and do not conceal themselves among men and women. Their clothing is distinct, and their teachings are free from perversity. They do not delude the world or deceive the people with doctrines of karmic retribution, misfortune, or fortune. They do not coerce others into donating their bodies or wealth as merit, nor do they act contrary to the Heaven that gave them birth or forget the land that bore them. Born in China, they uphold the Dao of China and do not forget their fundamental principles. Those who deviate from this Dao are not orthodox.\n\nThis teaching spreads across the Four Seas and is practiced throughout the world, beneath the utmost reaches of Heaven’s canopy and the utmost bounds of Earth’s support, within the light of the sun and moon and where frost and dew descend. Among all living people, the Dao they revere, the words they use, the clothes they wear, the dwellings they inhabit, and the utensils they employ—all were created by China’s sages, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Are they not all derived from our Daoist teachings?\n\nThe *Book of Zhou* states: “Within the realm, there are Four Great Ones: the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is great.” Within the Three Realms, nothing surpasses these in greatness. Confucius said: “Those who know by birth are the highest; those who know by learning come next; those who learn through difficulty come after. As for methods of cultivation and action—these are not what the sages esteem.” Thus, they are not considered great. Is it not that the *kun* and *fei* trigrams existed at the beginning of creation, coeval with Heaven and Earth? Therefore, Daoism takes Heaven as its master. How magnificent is the Dao of Heaven!\n\nI have seen books that seek to eradicate Confucianism and Daoism, which state: “In destroying the Dao, even the Jade Emperor of the Great Mystery trembles in the Nine Heavens, and the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning loses his gallbladder atop the Three Clarities.” Such vile words swarm like bees, too numerous to transcribe. In attacking Confucianism, they claim: “The teachings of Confucius are of little use in governing the world, do not comprehend nature and destiny, and only address the present life. He may be called a worthy, but not a sage.” They further say: “Confucius’ name and status were no different from ordinary people. He merely transmitted the words of the former kings and had no teachings of his own—he was only a compiler, not the source of a teaching. What Confucius spoke were mere expedients to correct the world, and what Mencius spoke was merely to criticize narrow-mindedness. The Confucian school is base, nothing more than a trinket among the vulgar.” These are all books written using the script created by the Yellow Emperor, yet they turn against the Yellow Emperor’s teachings, slander the learning of Confucius and Laozi, insult the Heavenly Emperor, and exalt themselves. Is this not an egregious error?\n\nAlas! Laozi said: “The superior person does not contend; the inferior person loves to contend. Only because he does not contend does the world have none who can contend with him.” The sage foresaw this long ago.\n\nWhen I was eleven years old, still in childhood, I encountered an elderly woman in blue garments who said to me: “You must never forget your long-held aspiration. Only after sixty years may you be permitted to speak.” Thus, I now record these matters directly.\n\nIn the forty-seventh year of Shaohao’s reign, in the year *zhaoyang chifenruo*, I received the mandate of the Great Clarity to be enfeoffed as the lord of □□ in Hedong. By the thirty-first year of King Wuding of Shang, in the year *sangzhao yanmao*, 1,029 years later, I ascended to the Great Clarity and was specially advanced as the True Lord of the South Pole, the Subtle and Empty Dao, residing in the ninety-fourth palace of the South Pole. In Heaven, I served for 2,699 years. The Great Clarity bestowed upon me the Jade Seal of Penglai and the Golden Talisman of the Great Yang, commanding me to descend to the mortal world to rectify the Dao of Heaven, revive the mystic winds, grasp the numinous pivot, and unfold the transformations of the profound.\n\nThus, establishing merit across the Three Realms and inscribing my name in the Celestial Register—how magnificent indeed! Therefore, I compose this work. It reveals the profound mysteries hidden within Heaven and Earth, inherits the radiance of the sun, moon, and Milky Way. Where will-o’-the-wisps once raged, demonic glows instantly subside; as the mystic winds spread far and wide, the Great Dao unfolds and opens. The shadows of a thousand years, long shrouded in darkness, are once more illumined by the light of transformation; the lineage of the Dao, spanning ten thousand generations, is again continued in this present age. Thus is the Way of the sages of our Middle Kingdom made manifest.\n\nWith reverence, I take up my brush, burn incense, and inscribe these words before the lofty and boundless.\n\n**The Venerable Elder of Longevity, Quxian of the South Pole, Subtle and Empty Dao True Lord, bows and writes.**\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Register of the Supreme Clarity of the Celestial-August Dao**\n**Table of Contents**\n\n**Upper Volume**\n- Chapter on the Opening of Heaven and Earth\n- Chapter on the Origins and Lineage of Daoist Teachings\n- The Celestial-August Dragon Scriptures\n- Chapter on the Revolving of Creation and Transformation\n- Chapter on the Ritual Forms of Offerings\n- Chapter on the Mysteries of the Celestial Heart\n- Chapter on the Official System of the Daoist Gate\n- Chapter on the Crimson Scriptures of Celestial Law\n- Chapter on the Rules and Ritual Forms of Purity\n\n**Lower Volume**\n- Chapter on Palaces, Altars, and Sacred Enclosures\n- Chapter on the Ritual Forms for Revering the Sages\n- Chapter on Celestial Music and Immortal Regalia\n- Chapter on the Ritual Forms of the Complete Perfection Tradition\n- Chapter on the System of Headdresses and Robes\n- Chapter on the Instruments for Cultivating Perfection\n- Chapter on the Numinous Scriptures of the Jade Satchel\n- Chapter on Auspicious Times for Morning Cultivation\n- Chapter on Numerical Records and Events\n- Chapter on Offerings and Sacrificial Items for Rituals\n\n---\n\n**The Jade Register of the Supreme Clarity of the Celestial-August Dao**\n**Upper Volume**\n**Composed by Quxian, the Venerable Elder of Longevity, True Lord of the South Pole, Subtle and Empty Dao**\n\n**Chapter on the Opening of Heaven and Earth**\n\nThis Dao—those who attain it may transcend Heaven and Earth to exist alone, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay.\n\n**The Dao of Heaven**\nQuxian says: This Dao is that of which Laozi spoke: \"Before the separation of Heaven and Earth, there was a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Vague and indistinct, silent and formless, abstruse and obscure, it cannot be heard. Compelled to give it a name, we call it the Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond reach, profound beyond measure. It envelops Heaven and Earth, bestowed without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, empty yet never full. Constricted, it can expand; obscure, it can illuminate; supple, it can be firm. Embracing yin and exhaling yang, it unfolds the Three Luminaries. Mountains rise high by it; abysses grow deep by it. Beasts run by it; birds fly by it. Stars and constellations move by it. By it, non-being gives rise to being; the humble attains honor; retreat secures precedence. Thus, though unseen and unheard, from formlessness it generates form; from soundlessness, the Five Tones resound; from tastelessness, the Five Flavors arise; from colorlessness, the Five Colors emerge. Therefore, being arises from non-being, and existence from emptiness. By the principle of the One, it extends to the four seas and pervades Heaven and Earth.\n\nIn its wholeness, it is simple as an uncarved block; in its dispersion, it is vast as turbid waters. Turbid, it gradually clarifies; empty, it gradually fills. Serene as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly existent yet vanished. The Weishi clan attained it to grasp Heaven and Earth; Fuxi attained it to inherit the Mother of Qi. The Northern Dipper attains it to remain unerring through the ages; the sun and moon attain it to remain ceaseless through the ages. Kunlun and Feng Yi attain it to roam the great rivers; Jian Wu attains it to dwell on Mount Tai. The Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu attained it to reside in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang attained it to dwell at the North Pole; the Queen Mother attained it to sit in the Lesser Expanse. None know its beginning; none know its end. Peng Zu attained it, living from the time of Youyu to five hundred years later. Fu Yue attained it to serve King Wuding, ruling all under Heaven. Riding the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, he ascended to become a constellation. Thus, Confucius asked Laozi: \"Today, in leisure, I venture to inquire about the Supreme Dao.\"\n\nLaozi replied: \"Purify your heart and wash your spirit; temper your knowledge and refine your awareness. The Dao—how indescribably difficult it is to speak of! Let me tell you its outline. The luminous arises from the obscure; order emerges from formlessness. The spirit is mastered by the Dao, coming from boundlessness and going to no end. Without gate or chamber, it is vast and all-pervading. Its use does not weary the mind; its response to things is without limit. Heaven cannot but be high; Earth cannot but be broad; the sun and moon cannot but move; the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao!\n\nIf the Dao could be presented to others, then none would fail to offer it to their parents. If the Dao could be told to others, then none would fail to tell it to their siblings. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then none would fail to pass it to their descendants. Yet it cannot be—there is no other reason: if the center is not mastered, the Dao cannot be known. If you return and seek it within yourself, the Dao is not far.\"\n\nConfucius returned and remained silent for three days. Zigong, perplexed, asked: \"Master, when you met Lao Dan, what advice did he give?\" Confucius said: \"Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. For those that fly, I can use a net; for those that swim, I can use a line; for those that run, I can use a snare. But as for the dragon, coalescing into form and dispersing into patterns, riding the clouds and ascending to Heaven—I cannot fathom it. Today, seeing Lao Dan is like seeing the dragon! My mouth gapes and cannot close; my spirit is disordered, and I know not where to dwell. What advice could I seek from Lao Dan?\"\n\nThus, Yanzi praised the Dao of the sage: \"The more one looks up to it, the higher it seems; the more one delves into it, the firmer it becomes. Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind.\" This is the Dao of which Laozi spoke: \"Look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; pursue it and its front cannot be seen; follow it and its rear cannot be seen.\" Such is the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: \"August Heaven has no second Dao; the sage has no dual heart.\"\n\nTherefore, I must straighten my robe and compose my countenance, raise my hands in a solemn bow, and offer a single word of counsel to the wise:\n\n*\"Beyond kalpas, fragrant responses are not far—*\n*borne on the breeze into the jeweled chambers of immortals.\"*\n\nIf you recognize this intimately here, you need only this single word: *Dao*. If you lack the eye, you will but somersault within your nostrils.\n\nHah! I open my mouth to laugh for you, and unawares, white clouds arise over the western hills.\n\nThe primordial *qi* is a thing of undifferentiated wholeness, born before Heaven and Earth. It stands alone and does not change; it circulates without cease and may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth. Before Heaven and Earth existed, its *qi* was chaotic as a hen’s egg, dark and moist, beginning to sprout. The vast primeval mist grew luminous, and the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate enfolded the Three as One.\n\n*Ji* means \"ultimate\"; *yuan* means \"beginning.\" The pure and light ascended to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descended to become Earth. The harmonious *qi* became human; the motley *qi* became the myriad things.\n\nIn the time before Heaven and Earth divided, the primordial *qi* was blended as one—this was the Grand Beginning, the Grand Unity. As the *Daodejing* says: \"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two.\" This is the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe Great Ultimate arises from the Ultimateless. In movement, it generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and in stillness generates yin. When stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each the root of the other. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. Creation is thus determined—this is the august title of Heaven’s principle.\n\n*Ji* means \"utmost extremity\"; *shu* and *ren* are names for the root and foundation. This is what is meant by the pivot and hinge of Heaven, the root and foundation.\n\nOnce the primordial *qi* divided, yin and yang were distinguished. Soundless and scentless, the light and pure floated upward to form Heaven; the heavy and turbid sank downward to form Earth. Heaven moves with vigor, circulating without rest. The sun, moon, and stars are suspended from it, and the myriad things are covered by it. Heaven is vast, Earth small; their surfaces are enveloped in water. Earth stands upon *qi* and floats upon water.\n\nHeaven’s motion is like the turning of a wheel’s hub, like a hat covering the Earth. Above and below, the primordial *qi* is as if a lidded box were pressed upon water to keep it from flowing—*qi* fills its midst. As the *Treatise on Heaven* says: \"Heaven is round like a tilted canopy; Earth is square like a chessboard.\" Heaven revolves, half above the Earth and half below. The sun and moon, though moving eastward, are drawn westward by Heaven’s rotation into the sea, like ants on a millstone: the millstone turns left, the ants crawl right; the millstone moves swiftly, the ants slowly, and so they cannot but go west. Earth moves ceaselessly, like a person sitting in a closed boat who does not perceive its motion—such is the vigor of the primordial *qi*, floating and roaming without rest.\n\nThe *Comprehensive Mirror’s Outer Annals* says: \"Heaven and Earth were chaotic as a hen’s egg. Pangu was born within it. After eighteen thousand years, Heaven and Earth split open. The clear yang became Heaven; the turbid yin became Earth. Pangu was within them, transforming nine times a day. He was divine in Heaven and sagely on Earth. Each day, Heaven rose a *zhang* higher, Earth grew a *zhang* thicker, and Pangu grew a *zhang* taller. After eighteen thousand years, Heaven reached its utmost height, Earth its utmost depth, and Pangu his utmost length. Thus living things began with Pangu, the ancestor of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. When he died, his head became the Five Peaks; his eyes, the sun and moon; his fat and marrow, the rivers and seas; his hair and beard, the grasses and trees.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Pangu’s tears became rivers; his breath, the wind; his voice, thunder; the pupils of his eyes, lightning. His joy became clear skies; his anger, overcast. Among the popular tales of the Qin and Han, Pangu’s head became the Eastern Peak; his belly, the Central Peak; his left arm, the Southern Peak; his right arm, the Northern Peak; his feet, the Western Peak. Only afterward did the Three Sovereigns appear. This is the beginning of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\"\n\nNumbers arise from the One, stand upon the Three, are completed in the Five, flourish in the Seven, and reside in the Nine. Thus Heaven is ninety thousand *li* from Earth.\n\nThe Measurements of Heaven and Earth:\nThe celestial body spans 357,000 *li* from east to west and north to south. Each quadrant measures 89,250 *li*. From Earth to Heaven is 80,000 *li*. Taking half the sun’s illumination of Yangcheng as the center, the body is perfectly round. The Southern Pole, seventy-two degrees, is hidden and unseen, forming the lower compass; the Northern Pole, seventy-two degrees, is visible and unhidden, forming the upper compass. Each degree measures 2,930 *li*, 71 *bu*, 2 *chi*, 7 *cun*, and 4 *fen*. In general terms, each degree is 3,000 *li*. Measured from below, each degree is as large as the sun’s disk at noon. Three hundred sixty-five degrees extend downward to the first layer of the Yellow Springs and upward to the starry heavens—97,200 *li*. From the lowest depths of the Nine Dark Abysses to the starry heavens is 12,180,000 *li*, as verified by the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Distances of the Directions:\nThe eastern extreme is where the sun rises; the western frontier, where it sets. The diameter between them is 200,023,572 *bu* and 72 *bu*. From the southern extreme to the northern frontier, the diameter is 230,500,075 *bu*, 75 *bu* less than the east-west span. These are the measurements recorded by Yu’s minister, Zhang Hai.\n\nThe Center:\nIt receives the correct *qi* of Heaven and Earth and fully embodies the transformations of the Five Phases. In Heaven, it is called the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Phases; in humanity, the Five Constants. Thus when humans are born, their form and appearance are correct, their voices are correct. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor matched Heaven, and the color of the center is called yellow. His teachings took Heaven as their master—thus they are called the Heavenly Dao.\n\nAll emperors and kings who possess the world revere Heaven to receive its mandate, honor the Heavenly Dao to govern the world. Thus it is said: \"They receive Heaven’s bright mandate and encompass the Four Seas.\"\n\nThe East:\nThe place where the sun rises, where the *qi* of generation resides. It governs spring and belongs to Wood. Its people are benevolent, called the *Dongyi* (Eastern Barbarians). The character *yi* (夷) contains *ren* (人, \"person\"), for they receive the clear *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The three mountains of Penglai and the ten isles of Fanghu lie here, so its people delight in longevity.\n\nThe West:\nThe place where the sun sets, where the *qi* of withering and killing resides. It governs autumn and belongs to Metal. Its people are fierce, called the *Qianghu*, *Quanrong* (Dog Barbarians). The characters *qiang* (羌) and *quan* (犬, \"dog\") reflect that they receive the turbid *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Ghosts and yin beings dwell here, so they delight in death.\n\nThe South:\nThe place of blazing brightness, where the *qi* of scorching heat resides. It governs summer and belongs to Fire. Its people are cunning, endlessly deceitful, called the *Tianman* (Field Barbarians). The character *man* (蛮) contains *chong* (虫, \"insect\"), including the *Miaoliao* and *Hu* tribes, for they receive the mixed *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The lands of shorn hair and bare feet lie here, so they delight in banditry and killing.\n\nThe North:\nThe place of accumulated yin, where the *qi* of severe cold resides. It governs winter and belongs to Water. Its people are brave, called the *Beidi* (Northern Barbarians), *Xianyun*, *Tujue*. The character *di* (狄) contains *quan* (犬, \"dog\"), for they receive the dark and gloomy *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The Khitan and Xiongnu dwell here, so they deem dying of illness inauspicious and death in battle auspicious.\n\nThe Sun and Moon:\nThe *Records of the Five Phases and Years of Emperors* states: After Pangu’s death, his left eye became the sun, his right eye the moon.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: Beyond the southeast’s *Mei* and between the *Gan* waters lies the land of Xihe. There is a woman named Xihe, wife of the Emperor, who gave birth to the ten suns.\nGuo Pu’s commentary notes: Xihe is likely the one who first gave birth to the sun and moon in Heaven and Earth.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* further states: In the wilds of *Quanhuang*, atop Yang Valley, stands Fusang, where the ten suns bathe. Nine suns dwell on the lower branches, one on the upper, each containing a crow within.\nThe *Master Huainan* states: The sun is solid, a great luminous essence. Within it is a limping crow, called the three-legged crow.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: The spirit of Mount Zhong is named Zhuyin. When it opens its eyes, it is day; when it closes them, night. When it blows, it is winter; when it exhales, summer. Its body stretches a thousand *li*, with a human face and serpent’s body, crimson in color. It is also called the Torch Dragon. Heaven is incomplete in the northwest, lacking the ebb and flow of yin and yang, so a dragon holds fire essence to illuminate the Gate of Heaven.\n\nThe Moon:\nThe *Master Huainan* states: The moon is Heaven’s emissary, the cold *qi* of accumulated yin, long condensed into water. The essence of water’s *qi* becomes the moon. The moon is the east of yin, so when the moon wanes, fish brains diminish.\nThe *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: The moon is the root of all yin. At the full moon, clams and oysters are full, all yin at its peak; at the new moon, clams and oysters are empty, all yin withdrawn.\n\nStars and Constellations:\nThe word *xing* (星, \"star\") means essence. The essence of the myriad things ascends to become the arrayed stars. It is also said to be the essence of water, or the essence of mountains and rivers ascending to become the arrayed stars. It is also said that yang essence forms the sun, and the sun divides to become stars—hence the character *xing* (星) is composed of *ri* (日, \"sun\") and *sheng* (生, \"to generate\").\n*Chen* (辰) refers to the Northern Asterism, called the North Pole, where the *Chen* star resides as the pivot.\nThe *Comprehensive Calendar* states: The Lord of Earth established the stars and constellations.\nThe commentary to the *Astronomical Records of the Later Han* states: The Yellow Emperor divided the stellar lodges. There are 124 constantly visible stars, 320 with ancient names, and 11,520 faint stars—all created by the Yellow Emperor.\nYet the *Book of Rites* states that Emperor Ku ordered the stars and constellations. Thus, the Lord of Earth first established the stars, the Yellow Emperor named them, and Emperor Ku later ordered them.\n\nThe Northern Asterism:\nThe North Pole has five stars, with Taiyi always at the center—this is the Pole Star. *Chen* is not a star but the central boundary. When the Pole Star resides at the center, the arrayed lodges align, a pattern existing since the beginning of creation.\n\nStellar Lodges:\nThe *Genealogy of Emperors* states: Upon receiving the Mandate, the Yellow Emperor calculated and divided the stellar lodges to establish pitch standards.\nThe *Han Records* also states: The Yellow Emperor fixed the stellar lodges, as recorded in the *Erya*’s twelve divisions and twenty-eight lodges—all created by the Yellow Emperor.\n\nLodge Degrees:\nFuxi observed the patterns of the five stars and divided their approximate degrees.\nThe *Records of the Grand Scribe’s Historian: Treatise on the Calendar* states: The Yellow Emperor named the lodge degrees.\nMinister Yan Zan said: Naming the lodge degrees means observing the degrees of the Three Luminaries’ advance and retreat to verify auspicious and inauspicious omens.\nIt also states: Emperor Wu of Han summoned masters of esoteric arts, and Tang Du divided the celestial divisions.\nThe *Han Shu’s Sound and Meaning* notes: He divided the twenty-eight lodges into bounded degrees.\nThe *Astronomical Records of the Jin* also states: Fuxi established the degrees of the celestial circumference.\n\nClouds:\nThe *Supplementary Exegesis* states: The *qi* of Heaven and Earth exhales to form clouds and inhales to form wind. Clouds are so named for their motion (*yun*, 运), rising when they strike stone.\nFog:\nWater vapor ascends and overflows, becoming fog. It is also said that when the *qi* of yin and yang are disordered, fog forms. Or that when earth’s *qi* rises and Heaven’s *qi* descends in response, fog arises.\n\nRain:\nWhen the *qi* of yin and yang harmonize, rain forms. Water descends from clouds as rain. Rain (*yu*, 雨) means to assist (*fu*, 辅), assisting and nourishing the seasons.\n\nThe Eight Winds:\nThe *Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall* states: What is wind? Wind (*feng*, 风) means to germinate (*meng*, 萌). It nurtures things to completion, thus corresponding to the eight trigrams. Yang is established at five, reaching its peak at nine-five. After forty-five days, it transforms, and this transformation produces wind. Yin joins with yang to generate wind. Forty-five days after the winter solstice, the *Tiaofeng* (Regulating Wind) arrives. *Tiao* means to govern. After another forty-five days, the *Mingshu Feng* (Bright Multitude Wind) arrives. *Mingshu* means to welcome the masses. After another forty-five days, the *Qingming Feng* (Clear Bright Wind) arrives. *Qingming* means clear and sharp.\n\nAfter another forty-five days, the *Jingfeng* (Majestic Wind) arrives. *Jing* means great, as yang qi grows and nourishes. After another forty-five days, the *Liangfeng* (Cool Wind) arrives. *Liang* means cold, as yin qi begins to move. After another forty-five days, the *Changhe Feng* (Gate-Closing Wind) arrives, signaling the time for storing and preserving. After another forty-five days, the *Buzhou Feng* (Unbound Wind) arrives. *Buzhou* means unjoined, as yin and yang have yet to harmonize and transform. After another forty-five days, the *Guangmo Feng* (Vast Desert Wind) arrives. *Guangmo* means vast, aligning with yang qi.\n\nThus, when the *Tiaofeng* arrives, the earth warms; when the *Mingshu Feng* arrives, all things are born; when the *Qingming Feng* arrives, the forms of things dry; when the *Jingfeng* arrives, thorns bear fruit; when the *Liangfeng* arrives, millet and grain ripen; when the *Changhe Feng* arrives, shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout; when the *Buzhou Feng* arrives, burrowing creatures hide; and when the *Guangmo Feng* arrives, all things lie dormant.\n\nTherefore, the ruler follows and aligns with these winds: when the *Tiaofeng* arrives, light punishments are issued and delays resolved; when the *Mingshu Feng* arrives, borders are repaired and fields cultivated; when the *Qingming Feng* arrives, silks and treasures are presented to envoys sent among the feudal lords; when the *Jingfeng* arrives, the virtuous are ennobled and the meritorious enfeoffed; when the *Liangfeng* arrives, the earth’s virtue is repaid, transforming the four regions; when the *Changhe Feng* arrives, legal punishments are applied and granaries prepared; when the *Buzhou Feng* arrives, palaces and city walls are constructed; and when the *Guangmo Feng* arrives, capital sentences are carried out and judicial punishments enforced.\n\n**The Celestial River (Tianhan)**\nIt originates between the *Ji* (Winnowing Basket) and *Wei* (Tail) asterisms in the east, called the *Tianhe* (Celestial River) or *Hanjin* (River Ford). It divides into two paths: the southern route passes through the *Chuanshuo* (Roving Fisherman), *Yuxing* (Fish Star), *Tianyao* (Celestial Key), *Tianbian* (Celestial Basket), and *He Gu* (River Drum); the northern route traverses the *Gui* (Tortoise), piercing below *Ji*, then through *Ci* (Silk), south of *Nan* (Southern Dipper), *Beikui* (Northern Ladle), and *Zuoxi* (Left Banner) to *Tianjin* (Celestial Ford), where it descends and merges with the southern route before proceeding southwest. It then divides again, flanking the *Paogua* (Gourd), threading through the *Renxing* (Human Star), *Chu* (Pestle), *Zaofu* (Charioteer), *Tengshe* (Flying Serpent), *Wangliang* (Wagoner), *Fulu* (Auxiliary Road), *Gedao* (Passageway), *Cidu* (Gate Tower), *Tailu* (Great Mound), *Tianchuan* (Celestial Boat), and *Juan She* (Curled Tongue), then turns southward, passing through *Wuche* (Five Chariots), south of *Beihe* (Northern River), entering *Dongjing* (Eastern Well) and *Shuiwei* (Water Level), then southeastward, weaving through *Nanhe* (Southern River), *Guanqiu* (Barrier Mound), *Tiangou* (Celestial Dog), *Tianji* (Celestial Discipline), and *Tianji* (Celestial Millet), vanishing south of the *Qixing* (Seven Stars).\n\nZhang Heng said: The *Jinhan* (Ford of Metal) is the qi of metal. Its root is called the *Shuihan* (Water Ford); when stars are numerous, there is flooding; when few, drought.\n\n**Thunder and Lightning**\nThe *Huainanzi* states: When yin and yang clash and interact, thunder is produced; when they strike violently, lightning is generated.\nThe *Shuyi* records: Lightning is the Heavenly Lord and Jade Maiden playing *touhu* (a game of tossing arrows into a pot), their missed shots causing Heaven to laugh, thus creating lightning.\n\n**Frost and Snow**\nWhen the qi of Heaven and Earth congeals and condenses into dew, it becomes frost; when rainwater freezes, it becomes snow.\n\n**Sleet and Hail**\nFormed when yin and yang coerce each other, embracing yin within yang.\n\n**Rainbows**\nThe unregulated qi of yin and yang, where pure yang assails yin. The male is called *hong* (rainbow), the female *ni* (secondary rainbow).\n\n**Yin and Yang**\nThe *Chunqiu Neishi* states: Fuxi established Heaven and Earth, dividing yin and yang and the Five Phases.\nThe *Shiji: Lishu* records: The Yellow Emperor established the Five Phases, originating the five divisions.\nYing Shao said: They are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nMeng Kang explained: Heaven has four seasons, divided into the Five Phases.\nFire began with Suiren Shi. In high antiquity, people ate fruits, melons, clams, and oysters raw, which harmed their stomachs and intestines, causing many illnesses. The sage then drilled wood to make fire, teaching people to cook raw food into cooked meals. Thus, he was named Suiren Shi. He established platforms for teaching, created markets at noon, and introduced the ways of exchange, through which human sentiments were communicated. The transmitted books of later ages differ: the Grand Historian Sima Guang and Liu Shu record over a hundred clans spanning eighty thousand years, or twelve thousand years, or four generations—none can confirm which is correct.\n\n**The Twelve Branches**\nThe Yellow Emperor established the twelve branches—*zi*, *chou*, and so on—to name the months, and also assigned twelve animals to correspond with them.\n\n**The Origin of Humankind**\nThe *Fengsu Tong* states: Popular tradition says that when Heaven and Earth first opened, there were no people. Nüwa kneaded yellow earth to create humans. Overwhelmed by the task, she drew a rope through the mud and flung it, forming people. Thus, the wealthy and noble are made of yellow earth, while the poor and common are made of rope.\nThe *Huainanzi* says: The Image Emperor gave birth to yin and yang; *Tupian* gave birth to ears and eyes; *Sanglin* gave birth to arms and hands—this is why Nüwa transformed seventy times.\nXu Shen’s commentary: The Image Emperor was an ancient celestial deity who, when creating humans, generated yin and yang. *Tupian* and *Sanglin* are names of spirits. It also says: *Turen* (Sudden People) were born from the sea, *Turen* gave birth to *Ruojun* (Mushroom-like Beings), *Ruojun* gave birth to sages, and sages gave birth to commoners. The ordinary and mediocre descend from commoners, who trace back to the *Turen*—this is the beginning of humankind.\n\n**The Year Star**\nThe planet Jupiter. When it descends among humans, it becomes a noble person. Dongfang Shuo was the essence of Jupiter; from birth, Jupiter did not appear, but when he removed his headscarf and flew away, the next day the Grand Historian reported that the Year Star had appeared—this was the event.\n\n**Yinghuo (Mars)**\nThe Fire Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a child, singing songs and playing games.\n\n**Zhenxing (Saturn)**\nThe Earth Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a woman.\n\n**Taibai (Venus)**\nThe Metal Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a strong man, dwelling in forests and foothills.\n\n**Chenxing (Mercury)**\nThe Water Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a woman, foretelling good and ill fortune, obscurity and prosperity, blessings and misfortunes—Heaven displays these signs.\n\nWhenever a star descends, it must have a corresponding host.\n\n**The Star of Numinous Efficacy**\nWhen the Han dynasty ruled the world, Emperor Gaozu issued an edict commanding the entire realm to establish shrines to the Star of Numinous Efficacy, primarily for praying for abundant grain.\n\n**Chapter on the Origins and Development of Daoist Teachings**\nThe origins of Daoism trace back to before the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, to the time before the first stirring of the vast chaos. When Heaven and Earth were indistinct and the primordial chaos had just sprouted, there must have been a master of creation present within it, capable of initiating Heaven and Earth and establishing the Three Powers. At that time, when the sun and moon had not yet been born, mountains and rivers had not yet taken shape, and things and principles had not yet manifested, its image was vast and indistinct, as the *Book of Changes* says: \"Before the ultimate, there was already a master governing it.\" Yet it was formless and nameless, remote and unfathomable—ultimately, its name cannot be known. Nevertheless, what is it that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and the myriad things?\n\nLaozi was the first to reveal its mysteries, encompassing the Two Modes, and thus forcibly named it the *Dao*. That which opened Heaven and Earth and initiated the myriad existents must have had its spirit, yet its name could not be known—so it was forcibly named *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning). Hence arose the name *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy), the progenitor of the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAccording to the *Dongyuan Lingbao Zhen’gao Yuanfu Jing*, its summary states: In ancient times, before Heaven and Earth had divided and yin and yang had separated, within the vast expanse of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless, the Supreme One transformed through the Three Qi to give birth to the Three Realms. By the time of Lord Lao, scriptures and teachings were transmitted, and thereafter the ten thousand norms unfolded. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign beheld the *Eight-Trigram Radiant Scripture* adorning the nine heavens with resplendent brilliance, transcribed it, and from this beginning, transmission commenced. Through the ages to the present, Daoist teachings have thus endured for myriad generations without end.\n\nAll emperors who receive the Mandate of Heaven are called the *Son of Heaven*. Thus, the son serves Heaven as a father. As the *Admonitions of Zhong Hui* states: \"Revere and uphold the Dao of Heaven to eternally preserve the Mandate of Heaven.\" The *Day of Tai Jia* says: \"The former kings heeded the luminous Mandate of Heaven to serve the spirits above and below.\" Therefore, receiving the bright Mandate of Heaven, they encompassed the Four Seas, above to uphold the Dao of Heaven and below to govern human affairs. It is also said: \"Heaven bestows its Mandate,\" and \"to receive Heaven’s Mandate and continue its work\"—all these are acts of serving Heaven. Thus, their halls are called *Fengtian* (Serving Heaven), and their gates *Fengtian*. *Chengtian* (Receiving Heaven) is never spoken without reference to Heaven. Therefore, the Dao as a teaching takes Heaven as its master, and so it is called the *Fengtian Dao* (Way of Serving Heaven), known as Daoism.\n\n**The Upper Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm is Yuanshi Tianzun, also known as Pangu. In the time before the Image Emperor, within the empty and spontaneous void, a hundred thousand layers of primordial qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Non-Being Sage Lord, who was honored with the title *Great Luo Yuanshi Zun*, the Effortless Spontaneous Wondrous Non-Being Supreme Emperor. Later generations called him the *Supreme Dao Treasure*, the ancestor of the myriad qi. In the time before the primordial image had manifested, this was the *Dao giving birth to the One*.\n  - Another account states: Before Pangu, prior to the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, that which gave birth to the Three Powers had a master of creation whose name could not be known—it was also called *Yuanshi*, yet distinct from Pangu.\n\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Earthly Sovereign of Upper Clarity’s True Realm is Lingbao Tianzun, also known as the Earthly Sovereign. In the time before the distant kalpas of *Yankang*, at the beginning of the vast primordial chaos, a hundred thousand layers of true qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Emptiness Sage Lord, who was honored with the title *Jade Palace Great Dao Lord, Wondrous Emptiness Supreme Emperor*. Later generations called him the *Supreme Scripture Treasure*, transmitter of scriptures and teachings, who initiated the norms of the Dao. This is the *One giving birth to the Two*.\n\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Human Sovereign of Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm is Daode Tianzun, also known as the Human Sovereign. In the time of the Crimson Brightness and primordial chaos, a hundred thousand layers of Dao qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Being Sage Lord, who was honored with the titles *Five Numinous Primordial Elder Lord* and *Hunyuan Supreme Dao Lord*, ancestor of the myriad teachings and Wondrous Being Supreme Emperor. Later generations called him the *Supreme Teacher Treasure*, who promulgated the Dharma and expounded the teachings, bringing the myriad images to completion. This is the *Two giving birth to the Three, and the Three giving birth to the myriad things*.\n\n**The Middle Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Treasure Lord, born from the mysterious qi of Yuanshi, became the Heavenly Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Numinous Treasure Lord, receiving the primordial qi of Yuanshi, became the Earthly Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Divine Treasure Lord, receiving the initial qi of Yuanshi, became the Human Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n\n**The Lower Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Sovereign is Taihao Fuxi, who ruled by the virtue of Wood. Born from the mysterious qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Donghua Perfected Azure Heaven Supreme Emperor*. Observing above and examining below, he received the *He Tu* (Yellow River Chart) borne by the dragon-horse and drew the trigrams, establishing images and initiating writing to open the myriad existents.\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Earthly Sovereign is Shennong, the Flame Emperor, who ruled by the virtue of Fire. Born from the primordial qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Southern Culmen Vermilion Numinous Cinnabar Heaven Supreme Emperor*. He first tasted the hundred herbs, taught people medicine, and disseminated the hundred grains, initiating the way of food and drink.\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Human Sovereign is the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, who ruled the world by the virtue of Earth. Born from the initial qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Taiyi Yellow Heaven Supreme Emperor*. He first created clothing, palaces, rites, music, writing, boats, carts, and utensils—thus the way of human life, food, and clothing was complete. The Emperor cast the Nine Tripods at Mount Jing, and when the elixir was perfected, a yellow dragon descended with its beard to welcome him. The Emperor ascended to Heaven on clouds and dragons with eighty-one female attendants and seventy-two ministers. According to the *Jade Calendar of the Grand Historian’s Astronomical Observations*, beneath the constellation *Willow* in the sequence of stars, there are seventeen stars of *Xuanyuan*—this is the verification. Thereafter, the Dao of alchemical ascension was transmitted to the world.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao**\nAccording to the *Sacred Records*, the Supreme Lord Lao resides above the Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm. He is the ancestor of primordial qi and the root of Heaven and Earth. Within the utmost stillness and emptiness, prior to the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, he is the master who opened Heaven and Earth and gave birth to the myriad things. Governing the cycles of time and directing the movements of qi, he harmonizes essence and unfolds transformation, creating and destroying the Two Modes through countless kalpas. His emanations pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust, beyond all reckoning. After the opening of Heaven and Earth, observing the world’s shifts between refinement and coarseness, he established teachings in accordance with the times, serving as the imperial teacher of successive dynasties, instituting laws and ordinances. Sometimes he descended from the Nine Heavens, sometimes he transmitted teachings across the Four Seas. From the Three Sovereigns onward, all emperors revered and upheld him. Thus, within the realms of Heaven above and Heaven below, all within the qi of the Dao are the transformations of Lord Lao. He has bestowed countless teachings, universally delivering salvation.\n\nFor the people employ it daily yet remain unaware—herein lies the enduring title bestowed by the Most High Lord Lao. Laozi is but a name; he is also called Dan, styled Boyangfu, and was the son of the Perfected One Li Lingfei. In the Zhou dynasty, those of great virtue were all addressed as \"Father,\" as with Confucius being called \"Nifu.\"\n\nYet Lord Lao the Most High is not to be confused with this Laozi. According to the *Annals of Shang*, Laozi was a man of Chu who first manifested at the frontier of birth in the seventeenth year of Yangjia of the Yin dynasty (gengshen, 1073 BCE). From the realm of the Great Clarity, he rode the essence of the sun, transforming into a five-colored pearl of mysterious yellow, large as a pellet. A jade maiden, napping in daylight, swallowed it and conceived. After eighty-one years of gestation, in the ninth year of Wuding (gengchen, 1191 BCE), he emerged from beneath her left armpit, already white-haired, and was named Laozi. Born beneath a plum tree, he took seven steps, one hand pointing to heaven, the other to earth, and declared: \"Within heaven above, heaven below, and the Three Realms, the birth of heaven, the birth of earth, the birth of humanity, and the birth of the myriad things—all are the transformations of the Dao. Thus, only the Dao is supreme.\" Pointing to the plum tree, he said, \"This is my surname,\" and so he was named Er, styled Boyang.\n\nBorn in the ninth year of Wuding (gengchen), he later greatly expounded the Dao. Posterity, witnessing the vastness of his teachings, came to address him as the Most High Lord Lao. *Jun* (\"Lord\") is a title for emperors and sages, while *zi* (\"Master\") is a general term for men. Thus, the Dao expounded by Laozi is none other than the Dao of Lord Lao.\n\nAs for his manifestations and descents before and after, they span countless generations, enabling him to establish models, institute teachings, and exalt the mystic wind for ten thousand ages. Later followers of his teachings also revered him as Lord Lao, though the uninformed mistakenly conflate him with the Lord Lao of the Three Clarities.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, Laozi served as the *zhuxia* scribe under the Earl of the West. In the time of King Wu of Zhou, he became the Keeper of Archives. From the Shang to the Zhou, he lived for nine hundred years before ascending westward to Kunlun. As Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"None knew his end.\" Confucius called him Lao Peng, a worthy minister of Shang. Liu Dian’s annals confirm Laozi was a man of Shang—this is clearly recorded in the Confucian classics.\n\nYet texts that seek to erase the Dao suppress the account of Laozi’s departure from the pass to transform the western lands in the twenty-third year of King Zhao of Zhou. Instead, they shift his birth to the era of King Ding, while the *Comprehensive Mirror* records that by the time of King You, Laozi was already lamenting the Yellow River’s drying—King You being ten generations removed from King Ding, with Laozi’s name appearing across those ten reigns. Such distortions cannot be concealed.\n\nConsider the *Wen Xuan*, compiled by Emperor Wu of Liang and Crown Prince Zhaoming, which cites the stele inscription of Wang Jianqi of Qi to expose the falsehood. This remains an unassailable consensus for all ages, making the sequence of events undeniable. The text states: \"The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the mirror of night’s radiance; the two Mings of Han and Jin jointly inscribed the brilliance of cinnabar and ink.\" The Five Ministers’ commentary notes: \"The two Zhuangs’ birth and the two Mings’ rise are recorded in the Confucian classics, not in Daoist scriptures.\" Emperor Ming of Wei wrote a preface, and successive emperors composed eulogies—Laozi’s birth is documented in the annals, proof beyond dispute.\n\nMoreover, the memorial of the Eight Scholars of Tang further clarifies the matter. How can one deceive others without deceiving the Confucian classics? Alas, the task is arduous indeed!\n\nAccording to the *Biographies*, in the ninth year of King Zhao of Qin, during the reign of King Nan of Zhou, the Zhou dynasty declined. King Nan surrendered his lands to Qin, and the great Zhou revolution occurred. Laozi, knowing Qin’s brutality and that his Dao would not prevail, ascended Kunlun in the west, and his ultimate fate became unknown—this is the truth.\n\nZhuangzi attained Laozi’s Dao, mastering the virtue of divine illumination, grasping the mysteries of Heaven and Earth, understanding the cycles of destiny, discerning the principles of cosmic ascent and descent, and perceiving the mechanisms of order and chaos in the world. He told the Qi man Yu Zhen: \"In one hundred fifty-seven years, the Zhou’s mandate will end.\" In one hundred seven years, during the jiayin year, Laozi, foreseeing Zhou’s impending fall to Qin and the obstruction of the Dao under Qin, must have gone into seclusion. Laozi was also called Lao Dan, and Qin Yi mourned him, calling out three times before departing—a sign that the Dao had perished. Thus, \"Qin Yi\" was taken as a personal name, with *yi* (佚) formed by adding *shi* (失, \"loss\") to the *ren* (人, \"person\") radical, meaning \"Qin lost the man.\" Hence, it is said, \"Qin Yi mourned him.\" The three cries signified: first, \"My Dao is lost!\"; second, \"What am I to do?\"; and third, \"Qin has lost the man!\" This demonstrates Zhuangzi’s mastery of the divine Dao.\n\nDuring the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, Laozi descended at the Yi Bridge in Xiapi and bestowed the *Su Shu* upon Zhang Liang, naming him the Yellow Stone Master. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, Laozi descended by the banks of the Shan River, known as the River Master or the Riverbank Sage. The emperor personally sought him, and the Most High granted him the *Daode Jing*. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, Laozi clarified and illuminated the scriptures. In the time of Emperor An, Laozi descended upon Mount Tai, named Jiang Xia, to stabilize the realm. Under Emperor Shun, Laozi descended to bestow the *Mengwei Secret Registers*. During the reign of Emperor Huan, he revealed the *Methods of Nourishing Life* and later the *Methods of Exorcism*. In the time of Emperor Ling, Laozi descended upon Mount Tiantai, transmitting to Ge Xuan the *Upper Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Great Cavern* scriptures.\n\nIn the era of Chen Liu, King of Wei, Laozi descended in Lintao Prefecture of Longyou, telling Wang Shi: \"The world will soon attain great peace.\" Later, during the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, Laozi descended upon Mount Song, bestowing upon the Daoist Guan Qianzhi the *Yunzhong Chanting of the New Precepts*. In the time of Emperor Taiwu, Laozi descended upon Mount Song, commanding Qianzhi to confer upon the emperor the title of *Great Peace True Lord*, whereupon the reign era was changed to *Great Peace True Lord*.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, Laozi descended upon Mount Zhongnan, revealing to the mountain recluse Li Chunfeng the omens of the Tang lord’s mandate. In the time of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, Laozi descended upon Yangjiao Mountain, speaking to Ji Shanxing of the Tang’s imperial destiny and foretelling the completion of his enterprise in the fifth month. Under Emperor Gaozong, Laozi descended upon the Hall of Great Ultimate, where princes, ministers, and consorts all paid homage. He also descended at the Yangqing Temple. During the reign of Empress Wu, Laozi descended in Hao Prefecture, warning against her usurpation of the throne, and later at the Spring Brightness Gate.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Xuanzong, Laozi descended in Shu. He also appeared at the thoroughfare of the Five Phoenix Tower, revealing that the sacred talisman lay in Yin Xi’s former residence. Later, he descended upon the Qian Yuan Pavilion, which was then renamed the Pavilion of the Descended Sage. He also descended upon Mount Taibai and in He Prefecture, foretelling the omen of An Lushan’s downfall. Under Emperor Suzong, Laozi descended upon Yunlong Rock in Tonghua Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Jingzong, he descended at the Grand Clarity Palace.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Huizong of Song, Laozi descended upon Mount Mao. Under Emperor Qinzong, he descended in Luoyang, informing the mother of Li Ruoshui that her son’s loyalty had moved Heaven and Earth, and the Celestial Emperor had elevated him to the ranks of the heavenly officials. Since the Jurchen ravaged China, transforming the Central Kingdom into barbarian lands, Laozi’s manifestations ceased.\n\nFrom this investigation, the traces of Lord Lao’s transformations span myriad kalpas, his ascents and descents unfathomable, his comings and goings beyond measure. Successive dynasties honored him with titles and enfeoffments, bequeathing his teachings to emperors and kings for endless propagation—this is the true account of Laozi.\n\nHis teachings were transmitted to Zhang Daoling of Han, who became the Celestial Master, acting as Heaven’s emissary to propagate the Dao. The Celestial Master, the Boundless, Lofty, and Illustrious Great Emperor—his surname was Zhang, personal name Daoling, courtesy name Fuhan. A native of Fengyi in Pei, his lineage traced back to the Ji clan. The fifth son of Xuanyuan’s son Qingyang, named Hui, served as Bow Minister, inventing the bow and arrow and presiding over the worship of the Bow Star. His descendants held this office for generations and were granted the surname Zhang.\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was Zhang Zhong. Eight generations later, his descendant served as minister to Marquis Zhao of Han. His line continued with Ping, who fathered Liang, courtesy name Zifang. Liang served Han and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Liu. His son Buyi, Buyi’s younger son Gao, Gao’s son Tong, Tong’s son Wuwang, Wuwang’s son Liren, Liren’s son Jue, Jue’s son Qi, and Qi’s son Dashun—Daoling was Dashun’s eldest son.\n\nIn the tenth year of *Jianwu* (jiayin), the fifteenth day of the first month, he was born on Mount Tianmu in Wu. In adulthood, he entered Mount Longhu, compounded the Nine Heavens’ divine elixir, and received from the Most High the scriptures, registers, and secret texts, becoming the founder of the Mysterious Teachings.\n\nThe *True Records* in the *Daoist Canon* and *Divine Pivot* state: The Dark Emperor was once the son of Shaodian, who married the daughter of Mount Shu’s clan and fathered Gaoyang, known by his virtue as Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu’s father dwelled in the Weak Water region, his neck bearing the marks of pottery from the Seven Rivers’ ford—thus was he called the Dark Emperor. Wielding the trust of the myriad spirits, overseeing the host of deities to guide all things, he commanded the hundred qi, summoned thunder and lightning. Thereupon, he rode the chariot of primordial unity.\n\nTo the north, he patrolled the dark tombs of Youling; to the south, he reached Jiaozhi; to the west, he crossed the Flowing Sands; to the east, he arrived at the Coiling Tree. All beings in motion and stillness, all spirits great and small, all within the light of sun and moon—none were not under his sway. Traversing the four quarters of the earth, circling beyond the eight directions, wherever there were mountains of terraced towers or mounds of yin palaces, he transported the stones of Anxi to seal and fill them. He cast the bronze of Mount Yu into sacred tripods, each offering one to the divine peaks of Dongshan—not merely Mount Juqu alone.\n\nThis is what is called the Dark Emperor, as recorded in the *True Records*.\n\nMoreover, according to ancient histories: In antiquity, the people and spirits followed separate callings. When Shaohao’s reign declined, the Nine Li disrupted virtue, and people and spirits became intermixed, their distinctions lost. Zhuanxu then commanded Chong, the Southern Regulator, to govern the heavens and oversee the spirits, and Li, the Northern Regulator, to govern the earth and oversee the people, restoring the old order so that none encroached upon the other. He first established the calendar, taking the first month of spring as its beginning—thus was he the founder of the calendar.\n\nAs the ages receded, though the *Daoist Canon* was gnawed by barbarian fires, the *True Records* still preserved its accounts at the margins, for even the Dao of Heaven has its abiding presence.\n\nFurthermore, the ancient titles of Yellow Emperor and Dark Emperor refer to Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor, and Zhuanxu, the Dark Emperor.\n\n**The Old Man Star of the Southern Pole**\nGonggong’s son, Gou Longshuang, attained the Dao and lived for over a thousand years. Ascending to dwell at the Southern Pole as the Longevity Star, it lies 143 degrees from the pole, entering the Well Mansion at three degrees, south of the Bow and Arrow stars—also called the Southern Pole. It regularly appears at dawn during the autumn equinox in the *bing* direction and sets at dusk during the spring equinox in the *ding* direction. It is customarily observed at the southern suburbs during the autumn equinox; when bright and large, it presides over longevity and prosperity. It governs the lifespan of all living people under Heaven.\n\nSince the Northern Pole resides in *chou-gen*, the Southern Pole lies in *wei-kun*. The Southern Pole sinks 36 degrees below the earth, where it cannot be seen. Thus, its spirit emerges from the earth to appear in the south, called the Old Man of the Southern Pole. Yet its emergence is not always complete, so its appearances are irregular. When seen, it is auspicious, its power and position equal in majesty. Aligned with the Central Dipper, it assists the Supreme Emperor. Though south of the Well Mansion, it does not belong to its sequence. It is regularly sacrificed to on the second day of the second month with great offerings, and on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month, it descends to the human realm to extend the lives of the virtuous—so records the *Treatise on Astronomy*.\n\n**Southern Lineage**\nBeginning in the Han, it was initiated by Lutang Zhao Sheng, Huayang Li Ya, Zhongli Quan, Lü Yan, Liu Haichan, Zhang Ziyang, Chongzhao Wang, Ma Ziran, Shi Xinglin, Xue Daoguang, Chen Niewan, and Bai Yuchan.\n\n**Northern Lineage**\nBeginning in the Song, Wang Chongyang journeyed to the Eastern Sea and saw seven golden lotuses in the sea. His master said: \"Here, seven perfected beings shall emerge.\" Thereupon, he ordained Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun—the Seven Perfected. The Quanzhen teachings began from this.\n\n**The Dragon Script of the Heavenly Sovereign**\n**Register of the Three Caverns’ Scriptures and Catalogs in the *Daoist Canon***\n**Great Vehicle, Supreme Dharma: *Treasured Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection***\nThe Dao of the Nine Sages in twelve sections.

After the barbarian fires, only 5,134 scrolls remain.\n\nIn the time of the Jin and Mongol barbarians, during the decline of the Song, a Qiang man named Huyan Mai, envious that the *Daoist Canon* contained such texts as the *Scripture of the Moon Hidden in Heaven*, the *Jade Latitude*, and the *Nine Heavens*—all supremely secret books of the highest heavens—conspired with the barbarian ruler Möngke Khan of the Mongols to have them all burned and destroyed.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nIts decree proclaimed: \"The Han people shall promote the teachings of the Han, and the Mongols must promote the teachings of the Mongols. How can the scriptures of the Han surpass those of our Mongols? Any book or single character found shall be swiftly burned and destroyed, leaving no trace for inquiry.\" Thus, they were cut off and left untransmitted. If any copies remain, they have not entered the *Daoist Canon*. Now, under the radiant heavens of our Great Ming, the people of China must honor the Dao of China.

Their decree proclaimed: 'Whoever dares to keep even a fragment or a single character shall not be pardoned.' From then on, the *Daoist Canon* of China was severed. This occurred when the Song faced collapse, the barbarians ravaged China, light gave way to darkness, and the obscure encroached upon the bright—such was the cause.\n\nFrom the Jingkang era, when Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were captured in the north, during the chaos of the Jurchen Jin’s invasion of China, the Qiang barbarians arose and destroyed the great Daoist books of China. Over the 272 years of the Yuan dynasty, they produced ninety volumes of heretical texts, falsely attributing them to Tang figures like Daoxuan, Daoshi, Xuanyi, Zhisheng, and Falin, thereby eradicating China’s Dao. Their *Record of Exposing Falsehoods* states: 'It would make the Jade Emperor of the Great Luo tremble in fear within the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning lose his gall atop the Three Clarities, the Lords of the Myriad Heavens blush in shame, and the Immortals of the Nine Palaces grovel in humiliation. They slander the Heavenly Emperor, obliterate Confucius and Laozi, and vilify the Yellow Emperor’s deeds—words too numerous to record.'\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor was the founding ancestor who established the ultimate under heaven, and Laozi was the ancestor of the Tang. How could people of that time destroy the ancestor of their own sovereign? How could the Chinese people destroy the Dao of China? In truth, these were the works of the Khitan Liao, Jurchen Jin, and Mongol Yuan. During the Duanping era of Emperor Lizong of the Song, when the barbarian bandits raided the borders, one or two volumes of these books were obtained. The emperor, upon reading them, sighed: 'Even with a hundred thousand volumes, the superiority or inferiority of China’s Dao versus that of the barbarians is evident without debate.' Thus, the titles of the heretical books that destroyed the Dao are recorded below:\n\n*The Veritable Record of the Balance Between Buddhism and Daoism* (4 scrolls),\n*The Continued Balance Between Buddhism and Daoism* (1 scroll),\n*The Treatise on Discerning Orthodoxy* (3 scrolls),\n*The Treatise on Debating Orthodoxy* (8 scrolls),\n*The Treatise on Destroying Heresy* (2 scrolls)...\"\n\n*The Hongming Collection* (14 scrolls),\n*The Expanded Hongming Collection* (30 scrolls),\n*The Dharma Garden Pearl Grove*, Volume 55,\n*The Zhiyuan Record of Exposing Falsehoods* (5 scrolls),\n*The Comprehensive Record of Buddhas and Patriarchs* (22 scrolls).\n\n**Zhengyi Registers of All Grades**\n*The Supreme Zhengyi Alliance of Might and Perfection Register for Cultivating Truth and Extending Life* (1 set, 3 scrolls).\nIn total, twenty-four grades.

With a single heart of filial devotion, nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals.\n\n*The Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Returning Chariot and Completing the Dao Secret Register* (1 set, 8 scrolls);\n*The Numinous Treasure Middle Alliance Secret Register* (1 set, 8 scrolls).\nThese two registers are jade tablets of Jade Clarity and jasper texts of the Great Empyrean, containing inner decrees of esoteric speech and secret words of the Central Yellow. They reveal the Three Luminaries, harmonize the hundred spirits, ingest the yellow blossoms, and expand or contract primordial qi. Jade fields bloom with flowers, and one roams the Three Isles. Amid misty clouds and golden crucibles, the elixir is perfected, and one whistles in transcendence. The sun and moon of the Nine Empyreans are attained; emptiness is embraced, and the One is held. One strides through the void and ascends the heavens.

The earth harbors the prison of the Blood Lake, renowned in scriptures as the \"Stone of Shame.\" All women in the world face the trials of childbirth; some bear the fruits of past-life evil, while others suffer present-life enmities. In pregnancy, they may harm the fetus, their pearls shattered like bees, their bodies departing the yang world, their souls cast into the yin pool. If devout women early awaken to benevolence and personally receive these precious registers—or if filial sons and obedient descendants do so on their behalf—their names are inscribed in the jade registers, their records erased from the dark bureaus.

The scriptures form the essence, while the registers constitute their application. They may exist in relation to one another but cannot be without each other.

Now, those who receive the registers dare not presume to use such titles, and only employ the term \"female.\" However, they are prohibited from using or being promoted to titles involving \"consort\" or \"concubine.\"\n\n1. In the initial rank, if one saves and delivers ten or more persons within a year, one is promoted from Right Judge to Right Grand Judge. After another year, if one saves and delivers ten more persons, one is promoted to Left Judge. After saving and delivering ten or more additional persons, one is promoted to Left Grand Judge. After another year, if one saves and delivers twenty or more persons, one is promoted to the eighth rank. After another year, if one saves and delivers twenty or more persons, one is promoted to the seventh rank. After another year, if one saves and delivers twenty or more persons, one is promoted to the sixth rank. After two more years, if one saves and delivers thirty or more persons, one is promoted to the fifth rank. After two more years, if one saves and delivers one hundred or more persons, one is promoted to the fourth rank. After three more years, if one saves and delivers one hundred twenty or more persons, one is promoted to the third rank. After five more years, if one accumulates twelve merits, one is promoted to the second rank. After ten more years, if one accumulates one hundred twenty merits, one is promoted to the first rank. From the third rank upward, these are the highest ranks, and they cannot be lightly conferred. Only those with lofty merits and renowned conduct, whose names are recorded in the immortal registers, may attain them; such ranks cannot be described by mere grade.\n\n2. Within the aforementioned years, if one’s merits in a given year are abundant, one may be promoted twice in that year, but one may not exceed two ranks in a single promotion.\n\nIf one’s merits are abundant but one does not wish to accept promotion, one may instead be reassigned to serve as a general or officer.\n\n1. If within a year one has neither merits nor faults, one shall remain in one’s current position as before.\n\n2. If within a year one has both merits and faults, these may only offset one another.\n\n3. If one idly wastes time, accumulating faults without merits, and lacks the conduct of a general or officer, how can one privately evade self-indictment and scrutiny? Such a person ought to indict themselves—how could they presume to advance?\n\n4. Saving lives is called *merit*; accumulating virtue is called *conduct*. What is termed *one merit* is roughly equivalent to saving one hundred persons. Calculated by fractions: saving ten or more persons may be counted as one-tenth of a merit. Extending the nation’s lifespan or resolving great crises—matters concerning salvation and relief—count as two merits. Praying for clear skies or rain on behalf of the people, driving away locusts, alleviating plagues, or averting floods and fires to benefit the people and all living things counts as one merit. If malevolent spirits or entangled curses manifest visibly and are widely resented, and one eradicates their root, this counts as one merit. For other cases involving one-tenth of a merit or more, the weight is assessed and converted accordingly. Performing rituals to eliminate misfortune or invoke blessings, completing jiao offerings, refining souls to resolve grievances, petitioning for the people’s lives, or achieving clear karmic retribution with verifiable benefits to salvation counts as one merit. For other cases, the weight is assessed and converted accordingly. Saving a woman in difficult childbirth, ensuring the survival of both mother and child, counts as one merit. If either mother or child is lost, this is calculated from one-tenth of a merit upward. Matters not fully enumerated here are to be assessed and converted according to reason.\n\n5. Concurrently serving in the Central Heaven Court, Supreme Ultimate Court, Demon-Quelling Court, Yellow Register Court, Supreme Clarity Court, Purple Court, and Southern Palace, as well as the Refinement-Receiving Bureau and other courts:\n   - From the ninth to the seventh rank, one is titled *Concurrently Supervising Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - From the sixth to the fourth rank, one is titled *Concurrently Overseeing Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - From the third to the second rank, one is titled *Concurrently Directing Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - Those of the ninth rank and above concurrently serve as Refinement-Receiving Officers of the Southern Palace.\n   - Those of the fifth rank and above concurrently serve as Directors of the Yellow Register Court.\n   - From the ninth to the seventh rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Affairs of the Three Realms’ Spirits and Demons*.\n   - From the eighth to the seventh rank, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the Affairs of the Three Realms’ Spirits and Demons*.\n   - From the seventh rank upward, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the City God Bureau*.\n   - From the sixth rank upward, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the City God Bureaus of the Nine Provinces*.\n   - At the fifth rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Soldiers and Horses of the Sacred Mountains’ City Gods*.\n   - At the fourth rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commander-in-Chief of the Soldiers and Horses of the Sacred Mountains and Rivers*.\n   - At the third rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Soldiers and Horses of the Nine Heavens*.\n   - At the second rank, one additionally holds the office of *Investigating the Spirits and Demons of the Three Realms and Adjudicating the Affairs of Grotto-Heavens, Blessed Lands, and Purification Halls*.\n\n6. When a beginning adept receives Daoist methods, they must first receive the register, allowing them to be appointed to the rank of adjunct ninth rank. Those who have not received the register may not be appointed to the regular ninth rank.\n\n7. In performing zhai and jiao rituals, even if one holds another rank, if one has not received the register and lacks the *Dugong* register or the position of *Jijiu*, one’s sincerity will not reach the gods. Those of the seventh rank and above who have not received the *Mengwei* register may not be appointed. Those of the fifth rank and above who have not received the *Dongyuan* register may not be appointed. Those of the fourth rank and above who have not received the *Shenxiao* register may not be appointed. Those of the third rank and above who have not received the *Great Cavern* register may not be appointed.\n\n8. Methods and registers are mutually dependent and must not conflict. The *Tianxin* method is suited to the *Dugong* register. The *Five Thunders* method is suited to the *Highest Divine Empyrean* register. The *Lingbao* method is suited to the *Purple Void Yang Light* register and the *Lingbao Middle Alliance* register. The *Tianpeng* method is suited to the *Northern Emperor Demon-Quelling* register. The *Tianshu* method is suited to the *Highest Clarity Returning Chariot and Dipper* register. The *Zhao Hou Southern* method has its own proper register, suited to the *Zhao Hou* register.\n\n9. The *Tianxin* method is the ancestor of all methods. The *Dugong* and *Mengwei* registers encompass twenty-four ranks and should be received first.\n\n10. The Southern and Northern Courts are called the *civil ranks*, while the Thunder Bureau is called the *military ranks*. For beginning adepts, it is easier to enter the military ranks from the civil ranks, but difficult to enter the civil ranks from the military ranks.\n\n11. The *Five Thunders* are:\n    - *Heavenly Thunder*, the bureau of the heavens’ attendants;\n    - *Divine Thunder*, the command center of thunder and lightning;\n    - *Dragon Thunder*, the guardian of the sea’s treasuries;\n    - *Water Thunder*, the bureau governing rain and moisture;\n    - *Community Thunder*, the spirits of famous mountains and great rivers who receive blood sacrifices through loyalty.\n    These serve the Emperor above and attend to the people’s affairs below, and may be commanded accordingly.\n\n12. The *Four Bureaus* are:\n    Within the Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court, there is the *True Lord of the Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court*, who presides over thunder and specifically governs the *Jade Pivot Five Thunders Court*. Additionally, there is the *Thunder Bureau*, which administers punishments, and the *Penglai Water Bureau*, which governs water and moisture. These three bureaus are all under the jurisdiction of the *Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court*. All cases of exoneration and imprisonment must not be presumptuously handled by the Pivot Bureau but are instead sent to the *Thunder Bureau*. The quota of the *Five Thunders Envoys’ Court* must not be arbitrarily used.\n\n13. When a beginning adept receives methods, they must seek a master of the current generation who is pure in conduct and upright in learning, and pay homage to them. The master, too, should select disciples of true capacity and only then transmit the teachings. First, one must summon guarantor officials and guarantor allies, present a sincere petition, and obtain clear guarantees before proceeding according to the proper forms. Memorials are submitted, and upon approval, one is ordained and granted the *Divine Empyrean Illumination Certificate*, the *Title Deed*, and other documents. Next, a jiao ritual is held to thank the master, and the methods are received and brought back to the altar.\n\n14. If within a year one has merits warranting promotion according to seniority, one must summon fellow method officials of the same rank to provide guarantees, submit a petition to the ordination master as before, and memorialize for approval and transmission. This must not be treated with negligence or irreverence. If the master is not of upright learning and the disciple is hasty and reckless, their names may not be recorded in the immortal registers, and the heavens will not attend to them. Only wayward shrines and lesser ghosts will falsely claim their names, inviting disasters. The true bureaus will investigate, and the resulting offenses will not be light.\n\n15. When a beginning adept receives methods and accumulates merits leading to promotion, they must still report to their master for transmission. They must provide a detailed account of the beginning and end of their progress, including the year and month, the names of their master and guarantors, the methods they practice, the merits they have accumulated, and the rank to which they are to be promoted. A petition is submitted to the *Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity at the Mysterious Altar*, who memorializes and issues the certificate. Only then will their name be recorded in the Jade Registers, and gods and humans will revere them. If one presumptuously exaggerates their merits, boasts to the world, or fails to report to a master and instead fraudulently fabricates ranks, falsely claiming promotions, or if one receives methods without proper transmission from a master and recklessly writes down official ranks, treating them as empty formalities, this will mislead the Mysterious Altar. What efficacy could there be in memorializing and issuing certificates under such circumstances?\n\nDiscipline is clear as daylight—heed it! Be vigilant!\n\n**Chapter on Revolving Creation and Transformation**\n**The Three-Five Flying Steps and Ranks of the Dang**\n\nThe Master said: The secrets of the Three-Five—how could they be easily known? From One, Two arises; from Two, Three is born. For the Three Qi divide and the Three Lights shine; the Three Lights shine and the Three Powers are complete.\n\nFrom the Great Ultimate, the Two Modes emerge; from the Two Modes, the Four Images arise. When the Four Images are complete, the Five Phases are whole; when the Five Phases are whole, the Five Stars shine; when the Five Stars shine, the Five Peaks stand firm. Thus, in the Dao they become the Three Pure Ones; in the world, the Three Powers; among spirits, the Three Origins; in humans, they correspond to the Three Sections. Again, in the Dao they are the Five Elders; in Heaven, the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Peaks; in humans, the Five Viscera.\n\nHumans possess Heaven and Earth, their forms divided into yin and yang. The Dao of qi is complete within the body, yet if one cannot nurture the Three Fields to gestate refinement or allow the Five Viscera to receive the numinous, then one begins to drift far from the Dao.\n\nThose who cultivate it gather treasures in the Three Fields and summon the Five Qi to return to the Origin. The po is restrained, the hun is bound, spirit is whole, and qi is full—this is the immortal’s Way of prizing life. Those who do not cultivate it allow the Three Hun to become the Three Corpses, the Five Qi to become the Five Thieves, and the Five Thieves to become the Five Sufferings—this is the ghostly Way of prizing death.\n\nThus, among all things between Heaven and Earth, humans are the most numinous. Therefore, every gesture of hand and step of foot is none other than an alignment with the Real. The method of stepping the Dang arises from this.\n\nThe stepping of the Dang is the essence of flying Heaven and the spirit of treading Earth, the true movement of humans. It causes the Three Powers to unite in virtue and the Nine Qi to merge as one. All ghosts and spirits revolve with Heaven and Earth. Each step and point, each turn and revolution, is complete within the workings of creation. The numinous is at one’s left.\n\nThus, one step resembles the Great Ultimate; two steps, the Two Modes; three steps, the Three Powers; four steps, the Four Seasons; five steps, the Five Phases; six steps, the Six Pitch Pipes; seven steps, the Seven Stars; eight steps, the Eight Trigrams; nine steps, the Nine Numinous Ones—this is the origin of the ten thousand steps.\n\nThe Master said: The method of the Yu Step has lost its authenticity in the world. Though many can speak of it, few truly attain it. Even those who attain it do not practice it, and those who practice it do so without devotion—thus, its efficacy is rarely manifest.\n\nThe Huoluo Dipper practiced in the world today is the pivotal essence of the Three-Five Yu Step, the comprehensive number of the intersecting River Chart. How could it be dismissed as ordinary? Yet due to errors in transmission, it cannot transform or communicate with the numinous. I now correct these errors to transmit its true form.\n\nThe Master said: One Qi divides into Three, named Mysterious, Origin, and Beginning. When the Three Qi divide, the Three Powers are established. The human body mirrors this: the pure and turbid form is divided into Three Sections, each with its own spirit—also called the Three Fields. Each field holds its treasure. Thus, from One comes Two, from Two comes Three—this is the true within our bodies. Together, they are called the Three Origins.\n\n*Origin* means greatness, primacy. Thus, the *Qian* hexagram in the *Book of Changes* calls the Origin \"the chief of goodness.\"\n\nThe Master said: The spirits of the Two and Five penetrate Heaven and Earth, yet all return to the single body. In their operation, there are methods of generation, conquest, restraint, and submission. When petitioning or offering thanks, one employs the generative cycle; when restraining or driving away, one employs the conquest cycle.\n\nWhenever stepping the Dang, first summon the spirits of the Three Origins and Five Phases, then proceed with the steps.\n\nThe Master said: The ancestral qi of the Five Phases is called the Five Elders. *Elder* means origin, ancestor. Drawing the essence of the Five Elders forms the Five Stars; the flowing essence of the Five Stars congeals to form the Five Peaks. Matched to the human body, they are called the Five Viscera. Above, they correspond to the Five Stars; in the center, to the Five Peaks—thus, the spirits reside within them.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Virtues generate one another: Wood generates Fire. The Five Phases and Five Qi conquer one another: Metal conquers Wood.\n\n**Upper Origin Dang (Attributed to Heaven)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Upper Origin Dang:*\nStep the essence of Heaven, command the ten thousand spirits.\nThe Upper Origin shields my body.\nGeneral Tanghong, assist my true qi,\nrepel and subdue demonic spirits.\nWhoever dares harm me,\nlet them suffer in their own person.\nMay evil demons, upon seeing me,\nbe reduced to fine dust.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\n**Middle Origin Dang (Attributed to Humans)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Middle Origin Dang:*\nStep the essence of humans, strengthen yang to disperse yin.\nFortify my Three Hun,\nexterminate ghosts and banish essences.\nMisfortune cannot reach me,\ncalamity cannot invade.\nThe Middle Origin conceals my form.\nGeneral Geyong, lead a thousand, ten thousand troops\nto guard my body.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\n**Lower Origin Dang (Attributed to Earth)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Lower Origin Dang:*\nTread the spirit of Earth, secure the human Dao.\nHeaven revolves, Earth turns,\nabove, the *Kui*; below, the *Qian*.\nYin closes, yang opens,\ntrue qi flows ceaselessly.\nGhosts cannot harm me,\nhumans cannot injure me.\nHeaven is my canopy,\nEarth is my support.\nWhoever dares harm me,\nbe pressed and sent to the *Kui* Dang.\nThe Lower Origin hides my form.\nGeneral Zhouwu, follow wherever I go,\nhasten to protect this true one.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Master said: When restraining fierce evil or overcoming disasters and dangers, first step the Upper Origin Dang. After completing the sequence in order, enter the Middle Origin Dang, then transform into the Lower Origin Dang. If restraining fierce evil, further transform into the Five Phases Conquest Dang to subdue Heavenly Dragons and ghosts. Spirits will respond to the heart’s summons—nothing will fail. Guard this secret!\n\n**Five Phases Conquest Dang**\nThe Master said: When restraining fierce evil or overcoming disasters and dangers, step this Dang. For example, Water can conquer Fire—thus, one applies the method as needed. To restrain fire calamities, step Metal and Water to control Fire. The rest follow this pattern. If later students are unclear, simply complete the stepping of the Dang without additions or omissions.\n\n*Incantation:*\nThe Five Phases mutually destroy:\nEarth and Water sever each other;\nWater and Fire extinguish each other;\nMetal and Wood assault each other.\nMay ghosts and demons, upon seeing me—?\n\n\"Sever the head, sever the feet.\nThe Demon Kings tremble in fear, torn asunder above and below.\nWhoever dares to transgress shall forever sink into the dark abyss—\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!\"\n\nThis Dang follows the pattern of Metal conquering Wood, Wood conquering Earth, Earth conquering Water, Water conquering Fire, and Fire conquering Metal. It is employed for restraining and subduing.\n\n**Five Phases Mutual Generation Dang**\nThe Master of Wood said: The Mutual Generation Dang follows Wood generating Fire. One generates, one destroys—all proceed according to the reckoning of Water as one, Fire as two, Wood as three, Metal as four, and Earth as five, completing fifteen steps in the three-and-five Dao.\n\n*Incantation:*\nThe Five Phases mutually generate—\nAll affairs prosper and flourish.\nWater and Wood achieve perfection,\nFire and Earth unite in harmony,\nMetal and Wood advance together.\nCalamity transforms into fortune,\nGhosts cannot harm,\nPeople cannot encroach.\nThe dead revive,\nThe withered flourish anew—\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!\n\n**Yu’s Steps of the Ninefold Numinous Dipper Dang**\nSun and Moon shine bright,\nHeaven and Earth pair in union.\nI enter the Dipper from Tianpeng,\nPass lightly by Tianchong, meet Fu, then retreat,\nReturn to Tianqin, facing the heart.\nEmbrace the Pillar of Heaven, freely gathering with the heroic,\nThe Dipper’s Dao flows—ghostly paths crumble—\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!\n\nThe Master said: *Huoluo* is the Dipper. This is called the Lesser Three-and-Five Dang. The world often remains unaware of its details, taking habitual practice for granted, ignorant of its profound subtleties. This Dang can subdue wild evil, command ghosts and spirits, and dismantle temples—its applications are many. When reversed in use, errors arise; now, the correct method is restored.\n\nEssential and wondrous, the Dipper governs the twelve celestial hours,\nRiding radiant light, martial might arrays.\nQi drifts like floating clouds,\nThe Seven Stars transform, corresponding to Heaven above.\nKnow their transformations—fortune and misfortune arise.\nEnter the celestial lodges, cross the Heavenly Gate,\nAlign with the Six Pitches, grasp the cyclical stems.\nTread upon Tianying, mount Tianren,\nPlunge into the limpid abyss—yet walk upon land,\nLean upon the Pillar of Heaven, embrace the Heart of Heaven.\nFrom here, ascend to Tianqin,\nRely on Tianfu, gaze toward Tianchong,\nEnter the Dipper’s depths, emerge from Tianpeng.\nThe Dipper’s Dao flows—hard and soft harmonize,\nAugmenting fortune and emolument, leaving blessings for posterity.\nEmerge from darkness—live a thousand myriad years,\nA thousand ghosts, ten thousand spirits naturally retreat—\nSwiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!\n\nThe Master said: This Dang, as commonly practiced, enters and exits the Dipper in reverse, hence its inefficacy. Now, the correct method is established—thus may one command ghosts and spirits, expel demonic paths.\nGuard this secret! Guard this secret!\n\nThe **Golden Light Encompassing Dang**\n\nThe Master said: Whenever ascending the altar to perform rituals, visualize yourself as the Divine Yu. Recite the incantation while forming the mudra, beginning with the *Jade Script* and ending with the *Noon Script*. Tread the Dang, traversing all within Heaven and Earth. Golden light encircles your body, transforming your form to subdue demons. Utter the sounds of *tiyin* and *zhali*. Envision before you a sphere of purple *qi*; soon, green *qi* descends from Heaven, piercing the purple *qi*. Suddenly, amidst the clouds, golden palaces and towering pavilions appear. Bow thrice in reverence, offering obeisance, and present your petition according to ritual.\n\nWhen treading this Dang, recite the *Golden Light Incantation*, one step for each phrase. Upon completing the incantation, proceed with the Dipper Dang.\n\n**The Yu King’s Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThe Master said: Visualize yourself standing atop Yu’s Dragon Gate excavation, amidst wind, thunder, and cloud *qi*, bearing the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor. With the left hand forming the Jade Mudra and the right wielding the Sword Mudra, summon and dispatch the myriad spirits as the matter requires.\n\n**The Mudra Technique**\nThe Master said: Mudras serve to commune with the true and subdue the perverse. Each mudra differs; the Dang mudras number over seven hundred, though few are now in use. The four cardinal directions and eight trigrams are marked by counting the joints of the four fingers, totaling twelve points corresponding to the twelve earthly branches. Within these, the Eight Trigrams, Seven Stars, Nine Palaces, and Three Terraces each govern their respective affairs. To simplify: the central joint of the middle finger is the *Jade Clarity Mudra*, while its left side is the *Northern Emperor Mudra*, known as the *Great Slaying Script*. These two mudras govern all matters across the Three Realms—employ them accordingly.\n\n**The Teeth-Tapping Technique**\nThe Master said: Tapping the teeth gathers the true and assembles the spirits. When a person’s *qi* scatters and the heart’s *qi* dissipates, true *qi* fails to respond—thus it must be gathered.\n\nTapping the teeth stirs the Gate of Heaven, summoning the spirit-*qi*. The left tap sounds the *Heavenly Bell*, the right the *Heavenly Chime*. For subduing, driving away, or descending spirits, use the front teeth—four above and four below, eight in total—tapping them together to sound the *Dharma Drum*, thereby communing with the true and reaching the Supreme Emperor. For audience petitions, tap thrice above and below, totaling twenty-four strikes, known as sounding the *Dharma Drum*. Remember this always.\n\n**The Entering the Chamber Technique**\nThe Master said: When establishing an altar, the chamber’s entrance lies in the southeast, the *Xun* earthly gate. If entering during a *jing* ritual, treat the *jing* gate as the entrance. Step through here, first tapping the teeth twelve times at *Xun*, bowing thrice in the heart, then advancing the right foot followed by the left. First visualize the Four Attendant Heralds and the Two Dragon-Tiger Lords standing to your left and right. Next, envision the chamber filled with blue, yellow, and white clouds of *qi*, then see the incense smoke form five colors, rising straight to the Golden Gates. Bow nine times—or simply in the heart, if preferred.\n\n**The Incense-Burning Technique**\nThe Master said: Enter the chamber with the left foot first, never glancing back—lest you invite misfortune. Maintain a single-minded stillness. Visualize the Azure Dragon to your left, the White Tiger to your right, the Vermilion Bird before you, and the Dark Warrior behind. The Heralds and Jade Maidens ride the five-colored *qi* of your five viscera, ascending straight to the Three Heavens. Focus your thoughts without obstruction. When you feel a gentle warmth within, it is the true *qi* uniting with virtue.\n\nWhen burning incense, ensure a blazing fire. Then, pinch the incense and place it in the censer—this is called *offering incense*. *Feng* means abundance; let the smoke rise in a single, vigorous ascent, reaching without delay. If the incense smoke frays or the flame weakens, it cannot transcend to the true or reach the numinous.\n\nAlways hold the incense in the left hand—the *rubbing hand*. The right hand is impure and must not touch the incense.\n\n**The Incense-Petition Technique**\nThe Master said: Maintain a heart free of external distractions and inner杂念. See only true light and Brahman *qi* before you, with purple and azure *qi* filling the space ahead and behind. Cast aside all thoughts, ascending directly to the Ten Directions. Offer incense to the Ten Directions, and true *qi* descends to meet the incense smoke within the *qi*. Vaguely perceive the boundless true immortals and celestial lords arriving from all directions amidst fine rain and dense mist. Then, at the ritual table, see the incense transform into five colors. The Heralds and Talisman Clerks appear in the void. Your body seems to ascend to the Three Heavens, where you personally behold the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor. Tap your teeth thirty-six times, swallow the saliva nine times, then proceed according to the ritual.\n\nThe Master said: Beginners in the Dao are prone to wandering thoughts and doubts; do not burden them with elaborate texts. Within simplicity, observe and contemplate—the subtlety lies beyond words. If one can advance in rank and ascend the mystery, from here to inheriting the lineage, attaining immortality is not difficult.\n\n**The Petition-Presenting Technique**\nThe Master said: When presenting petitions, healing illnesses, or deploying talismans, first visualize the Primordial Beginning in the Upper Cinnabar Field, the Dao Lord in the Middle Cinnabar Field, and the Old Lord in the Lower Cinnabar Field. Then visualize the Three Palaces and Three Perfected Ones, each in your likeness. First, envision the Lord within the Lower Cinnabar Field merging with the Dao Lord in your heart, standing together in your crown as if seated in a golden palace. Your body kneels in obeisance as you secretly present your petition—immediate resonance will follow.\n\n**The Audience with the True and Emperor-Visiting Technique**\nThe Master said: A humble novice is but an ordinary person, with desires for food, drink, and sensuality no different from others. Yet now, having received the registers and practiced the methods, you are called a Dharma Master, donning starry crowns and cloud-patterned robes, aspiring to resemble immortals and sages. But if your heart remains unsettled, your *qi* restless, still entangled in lust and impurity, tainted by filth and stench—how can you hope to visit the Supreme Emperor beyond the void? Without the method of clarity and brightness, you cannot evoke resonance but will instead incur transgressions.\n\nThus it is said: Even an evil person, through purification, fasting, and bathing, may serve the Supreme Emperor. This is the meaning.\n\n**The Fasting and Offering Audience Technique**\nThe Master said: During offerings and audience rituals, adhere to the prescribed forms, merging body and mind. Constantly visualize the Golden Gates high above the vault of Heaven, unaware of standing on the altar, sensing only that you are amidst the Nine Empyreans. In recitation and visualization, sever all delusive thoughts.\n\nThus does profound resonance arise—not merely in outward ritual.\n\n**The Prayer and Petition Technique**\nThe Master said: In ordinary times, frequently examine yourself. Enter stillness, sit in silence, and cast aside all mundane concerns. When your *qi* and bearing settle, envision within the empty vastness atop your crown a jade hall with golden towers, where the Heavenly Worthy sits in golden majesty. Sustain this visualization until you feel the true *qi* suffusing your fontanel, a subtle warmth radiating inward. This is the method for daily practice.\n\nWhen matters arise, employ the same visualization and align your body, suddenly finding yourself kneeling before the Heavenly Worthy. Silently offer your prayers, and nothing will fail to be answered. These are the essential instructions of the lineage masters, passed down to guide disciples in their first steps. This is the wondrous technique for ascending the hall and entering the inner chamber—guard it well, and do not reveal it to the uninitiated.\n\n**The Talisman-Writing Technique**\nThe Master said: In writing talismans, the key is to settle the mind and exclude all external thoughts. The brushstrokes must be precise yet fluid, so that when you begin, spirit does not wander nor *qi* scatter. If you recite the text while writing, the talisman may take form, but if your eyes shift, intent follows, and the mind strays with the brush, resonance will not arise.\n\nThe mind must unite with the talisman, the talisman with the mind. Draw *qi* without hesitation, exhale it silently, and inscribe the talisman—this is called \"self-transmitting the joyous spirit,\" for it speaks to the mind’s steadfast clarity. Later sections will elaborate in detail; beginners should first master this.\n\n*Direct Pointers to the Jade Hall*\n\nThe Master said: The Jade Hall is the esoteric core of the Celestial Heart Ancestral Teachings, the wellspring from which all methods flow, the revered path of the Three Realms. Since the time of the Celestial Master of Han, it has been transmitted solely as a mind-seal, devoid of extraneous techniques—nothing but orthodoxy. Orthodoxy means the absence of deviation. Heaven covers and nurtures through orthodoxy; Earth bears and sustains through orthodoxy; *qi* circulates through orthodoxy; ghosts and spirits are commanded through orthodoxy. When a person rectifies the heart, the body follows; if the heart is not rectified, deviant thoughts arise, the Six Desires stir, and one degenerates into a beast or sinks into the realm of hungry ghosts. Those who, in this world, fail to uphold orthodoxy become treacherous and perverse, rebelling against the Dao, and are barred from the domain of true immortals. The emergence of the great teachings of the Jade Hall originates with the Orthodox Celestial Master. Orthodoxy precludes deviation; unity precludes duality.\n\nThose who inherit this teaching are divided into five ranks. For those in the world who weary of dust and aspire to truth, upon first entering the altar, they receive the *Ten Scrolls of the Orthodox Celestial Heart Method*. After practicing for three years, free from disrespect toward the master or contempt for the Dao, and without slackening in diligence, they may proceed to the next stage, receiving the seventh rank. If their conduct remains faultless, they advance two ranks, don the seal of the Jade Altar’s orthodox rank, and are permitted to ascend the High Flight to the Jade Capital. After twelve years of practice, if proven not to be among the common rabble of markets and streets, nor of the ranks of servants, menials, corrupt clerks, or oppressive officials, and if not merely dull-witted parasites in temples and abbeys, they may be entrusted with the supreme宗旨, the *Twenty-Four Ranks*, the *Three Ascents Precious Registers*, and the seals of the *Three Sceneries of the Jade Hall*. The *Jade Scenery Ascending the Hall Seal* designates them as lineage-holding branch masters. \"Branch\" signifies the division into separate streams. This transmission is not limited in number but is restricted to gentlemen of official rank, scholars of Confucian or Mohist refinement—all may bear and uphold it. It is forbidden to transmit it to the common Daoist clergy of the marketplace.\n\nIn this age, many among the Daoist clergy are those who, destitute and forsaken, rejected by the four classes of society, turn to donning the yellow cap and entering the Dao not out of sincere devotion but out of desperation. Such individuals may treat the sacred texts with disdain, lose the secret teachings, and incur unforgivable transgressions. The above describes the fourth rank. Transmission and ordination.\n\nFor the fifth-rank transmission lineage, the lineage-holding master transmits solely to one rightful successor. They confer the Twenty-Four Forbidden Scriptures in jade script, the *Xuanhe Sword for Beheading Demons*, and the *Seal for Summoning Perfected Beings and Subduing Demons*. Only after thirty years may this transmission be passed on. Now, with the initial rank and first stage of ordination, its texts are concise, its practice simplified—every person may uphold it, and all may gaze in aspiration toward the Jade Hall.\n\nOn the day of ascending the altar, the disciple advances with measured steps, bearing the pledge of faith and oath. Even if one holds high office or noble rank, they must not slight the Perfected or disdain the Dao. They shall bow nine times before the altar of covenant to receive the transmission.\n\nFrom this moment, they bear the mystery of the Dao and must not contravene the master’s instructions. Henceforth, they ascend the path of immortals and enter the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible. Should one fail to heed this teaching, transmitting recklessly or receiving lightly, the Three Officials shall record their transgressions, the Four Administrators shall tally their faults, and the Heavenly Bureau shall pronounce judgment. Their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer retribution in the trials of the Wind-Knife, their souls bound to eternal night. Ten thousand repentances cannot cleanse this, a thousand Perfected Ones cannot redeem it. Thus, transmission must be conducted with utmost care.\n\nThe practice of the initial rank’s teachings is transmitted orally and sealed in the heart, comprising twenty matters:\n\n1. Each day, cultivate with reverence and diligence, gradually distancing oneself from worldly affairs. One must not mingle with the dust of the vulgar or engage in frivolous pursuits. Over time, as the precepts and conduct become radiant, one may proceed to the next stage of transmission.\n\n2. Preserve and refine the *qi* of the Radiant Yang and Conjoined Yin. Devote oneself to its circulation, and in time, true *qi* will suffuse the body. Through exhalation and inhalation, one becomes Perfected, and without conscious effort, ghosts and spirits will stand in awe.\n\n3. Upon receiving the teachings in full, take the Great Dao as the ancestral root. In all actions, maintain right mindfulness and never entertain wayward thoughts.\n\n4. Each morning, recite the true scriptures and secret incantations. Rise early to offer incense, meditating in silence without vocalizing. Let the heart alone resonate, and never allow worldly affairs to disrupt this regular practice.\n\n5. When encountering malevolent spirits or wicked demons harming the people, act strictly in accordance with orthodox teachings, ensuring their execution without fail. If one harbors fear or seeks favor from ghosts and spirits, this betrays a divided heart and incurs grave offense. The Three Officials shall punish without pardon or reprieve.\n\n6. Employ celestial generals and officials with rightful intent. Never use blood offerings to mingle impure *qi*. Violators shall be penalized by the Three Officials.\n\n7. Take the Three Luminaries as the foundation. The Three Luminaries are the eyes of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang, and the ancestral origin of creation. Cultivate the heart and circulate true *qi*, merging with the Imperial Perfected Threefold Radiance as one. Not only will this subdue the Three Realms and bind demonic spirits, but one’s own body shall radiate light, all spirits shall stand in awe, corpses shall be repelled, illness expelled, and one shall attain the Dao and long life, ascending to join the Immortal Perfected.\n\n8. By day, preserve the Three Luminaries and ingest *qi*. By night, preserve the Dipper, presenting it to the body so that self and spirit become one, spirit and *qi* intermingling. Only then may one be called a lineage-holding master.\n\n9. First practice the method of *Three-Eights Atonement*. At each fortnightly solar term, dispatch the body’s celestial generals to offer memorials and engage in cultivation as prescribed. If this is practiced without cease, one shall become a person without fault and may then speak of inheriting the Mystery Teachings.\n\n10. Each day, ingest the talisman of the Three Luminaries and await its response.\n\n11. Abstain from lust and anger. Always respond to the world with kindness and compassion. Sacrifice for others, never attack the root or slander the master, nor envy the worthy or resent the capable. Do not speak with a forked tongue or engage in quarrels and strife. If one has harbored such duality, from this day forward, reform and cultivate virtue. Constantly maintain a single-minded focus: distance oneself from wealth and profit, abandon deceit and flattery, reduce carnal desires, uphold fasting and precepts, and discipline the heart.\n\n12. When offering incense, visualize the five-colored *qi* emanating from the five viscera, coalescing into a floral canopy that ascends to the Empty Mystery. The Celestial Thearch, gazing from the void, shall witness it, and thus the offering shall surely reach its destination.\n\n13. When writing talismans, enter seclusion and stabilize the mind. Dip the brush and compose the talisman, holding the breath and reciting the incantation silently. Clench the fists firmly, adopting an unyielding demeanor. The body must be upright, the heart correct; the heart serene, the spirit responsive.\n\n14. Merge the One Perfected with the Dao. Detach from all external affairs. Do not let the heart be distracted by phenomena or generate covetous thoughts. Reflect on the impermanence of worldly matters; only the Dao endures. Abide in the One Perfected, and the Void shall respond to the One Spirit.\n\n15. Upon entering or exiting, visualize the Heavenly Soldiers, Merit-Officials, and Jade Maidens arrayed to the left and right. Evil shall not dare encroach upon the upright, and even if *qi* stirs with private impulse, preserve the visualization as before.\n\n16. On the ten auspicious days, *gengshen* and *jiazi*, the Three Origins and Three Assemblies, the new and full moons, the eight solar terms, and the five seasonal festivals, retire to a separate chamber to contemplate the Perfected. Always maintain reverence as if hosting honored guests—this is most sublime.\n\n17. Do not inwardly harbor cunning or treacherous thoughts while outwardly displaying a gentle and kind demeanor. Do not covet what is not rightfully yours. Seek only what is justly obtained. Violators must reflect on their faults, reform, and atone. Repeated offenses are forbidden.\n\n18. Serve parents with filial piety. Do not let wealth or poverty alter one’s devotion. Obey and attend to them with joy. To oppose the wishes of one’s kin is called unfiliality. Unfiliality is a grave offense, admitting no pardon.\n\n19. When parents pass away, exert all effort in sincere contemplation and prayer to the Celestial Thearch, seeking their deliverance from the dark realms and ascent to the Heavenly Halls. If parents remain in the gloom of the netherworld, one’s own immortal attainments shall not be fulfilled.\n\n20. Treat brothers, clan members, distant relatives, and in-laws with harmony and kindness. Do not take sides to provoke disputes or harbor resentment, thereby losing the bond of kinship. Violators shall not command the obedience of spirits across the Three Realms. Exercise caution in such matters.\n\nConduct oneself within the bounds of rules and standards. Should the heart ever stray, correct it promptly. Aspire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the sages and worthies. Do not belittle oneself or entertain reckless thoughts.\n\n**Rites and Regulations for Offering Ceremonies**\n\n**Chapter on Ritual Forms for Offerings**\n\n**Taiyi Fast:** Performed by emperors to extend ritual homage and align with Heaven.\n\n**Nine Heavens Fast** and **Golden Register Fast:** Established by the state to pray for the prolongation of imperial reign.\n\n**Jade Record Fast:** Conducted to protect and bless the empresses and the six palaces.\n\n**Great Yellow Register Fast:** All possess ranks and grades; one must consult established precedents and not act recklessly. Those conducted by scholar-officials and commoners may only be termed \"offering rites.\"\n\n**River Chart, Mysterious Numinosity, and other offerings:** Encompassing dozens of names, all are offerings. In antiquity, \"offering\" was another name for sacrifice. No rite surpasses the offering in summoning the Celestial Thearch and assembling the myriad spirits.\n\n1. State-sponsored offerings follow three-day or seven-day rituals. According to the *Lingbao Scripture*’s fast methods, there are twenty-seven days of observance. Du Guangting’s *Offering Grades* lists seventy-two ranks, all employed by the state. As with the *Three Caverns*’ ritual forms, each has its fixed model.\n\n2. When officials, commoners, scholar-officials, or common households conduct offering fasts, they should limit them to one day and night. Some extend them to three or seven days and nights, but this risks irreverence and may instead incur divine censure. Even high officials do not stay overnight in the homes of commoners; how much less would the Supreme Thearch, dwelling in the ninefold heavens, condescend to remain among mortals for three or seven days and nights without returning? Thus, the offering regulations are set: for a one-day offering, preparations begin in advance, and on the appointed day, the rite commences at dawn and concludes by deep night, thereby avoiding disrespect to the sacred. The ritual forms and grades are recorded in the *Jade Palace* and *Mysterious Model* manuals; one may consult them as needed.\n\n3. For grand offerings held to open the altar, the finest locations are grotto-heavens, blessed lands, and Daoist abbeys. The altar must be properly oriented, facing south with its back to the north. If an abbey already has an altar but its orientation is skewed, one may set up the altar in another suitable space according to the prescribed form.\n\n4. When conducting an offering, one must act within one’s means: the wealthy prepare fully, while the poor adapt as they can. Do not use ill-gotten wealth for offering supplies, nor haggle over prices, nor hastily prepare when resources suffice, nor force arrangements beyond one’s capacity—all such acts lack sincerity and fail to move the spirits. If the sponsor is a household of loyalty and filial piety, exerting utmost effort, and the master performs rites on their behalf—such as presenting dragon silks—all matters should be simplified. The requisite documents, offerings, and other elements will naturally resonate with the divine.\n\n5. The visualization techniques and methods employed during offering rites are recorded in the *Chapter on Circulating the Transformations of Qi*. The musical instruments and celestial processions are detailed in the *Chapter on Heavenly Music and Ritual Regalia*; thus, they are not elaborated here.\n\n6. All documents and dispatches follow the *Jade Palace* and *Mysterious Model* formats, supplemented by ancient precedents. Consult the catalogues and apply them as needed. For instance, memorials to the August Thearch use the *memorial* form, while others use the *petition* form. Documents for spirit officials employ the *official dispatch* form.\n\n7. Memorials always refer to the sender as \"your servant,\" while petitions use the sender’s name. Documents from the Heavenly Pivot Institute refer to the office as \"this bureau.\" For cover slips, official notes, and dispatches, the office is termed \"this bureau.\"\n\n8. On memorials and petitions, leave one hand’s width of space at the top and two at the bottom. The paper should be one foot and four inches in height; for other documents, unfolded letter paper is best. Invitation and offering petitions use only petition paper, as prescribed.\n\n9. For the sacred positions listed within memorials, use yellow labels, filling them in at the time.\n\n10. The yellow cover slip on memorials should be three inches and two *fen* in height and two inches and four *fen* in width, or three inches and six *fen* in height and three inches in width as a standard. Write the cover slip in a single column, and after affixing it, sign your name at the seam and apply the seal.\n\n11. For memorials accompanied by a yellow cover slip, use a small yellow label, affixed diagonally below the Tai Sui. This follows ancient practice, though it is seldom used today.\n\n12. For memorials and petitions that list only one sacred position, use a yellow label affixed diagonally. For two, three, or four positions, use a slightly wider yellow label affixed in the center. For three or five positions, the center is the most honorable; for two or four, the right is the most honorable. Write \"Before the August One\" or \"Before the Sacred\" in the sacred section, or only the foremost position. For petitions to deities of the lower realms, use white labels, applying them as circumstances require.\n\n13. The outer envelopes of memorials and petitions do not require yellow cover slips or the title \"your servant\"; simply write the sender’s name. The same applies to the outer envelopes of memorials, petitions, and other documents. If a petition lists many sacred positions, the envelope need only name the foremost.\n\n14. In memorials and petitions to the Thearch, refer to the decree as the \"Compassionate Edict of the Dao.\" For the August Thearch, use \"Sagely and Wise Edict\"; for the Two Empresses, \"Sacred Edict of the Celestial Palace\"; for the Three Clarities and Four Emperors, \"Your Majesty\"; for the Two Empresses, \"Your Palace\"; for the various August Ones, \"Before the August One\"; for the Perfected, \"Before the Sacred\"; and for deities of the lower realms, \"Before the Spirit,\" \"Before the Court,\" and the like.\n\nThe **Great Yellow Register Fast** possesses ranks and grades; one must consult established precedents and not act recklessly. Those conducted by scholar-officials and commoners may only be termed \"offering rites.\" **River Chart, Mysterious Numinosity, and other offerings** encompass dozens of names, all offerings. In antiquity, \"offering\" was another name for sacrifice. No rite surpasses the offering in summoning the Celestial Thearch and assembling the myriad spirits.\n\n1. State-sponsored offerings follow three-day or seven-day rituals. According to the *Lingbao Scripture*’s fast methods, there are twenty-seven days of observance. Du Guangting’s *Offering Grades* lists seventy-two ranks, all employed by the state. As with the *Three Caverns*’ ritual forms, each has its fixed model.\n\n2. When officials, commoners, scholar-officials, or common households conduct offering fasts, they should limit them to one day and night. Some extend them to three or seven days and nights, but this risks irreverence and may instead incur divine censure. Even high officials do not stay overnight in the homes of commoners; how much less would the Supreme Thearch, dwelling in the ninefold heavens, condescend to remain among mortals for three or seven days and nights without returning?\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe present regulations for offering rituals are as follows: For a one-day ritual, preparations are made in advance, and on the appointed day, the ceremony begins at dawn and concludes at deep night, so as not to risk disrespect toward the sacred. The ritual protocols and standards are recorded in such works as the *Jade Capital* and *Mystic Model Administrative Documents*; when the occasion arises, one may consult them.\n\n1. For the opening of the altar and the establishment of a grand offering, it is best to conduct it within the sacred precincts of a grotto-heaven, blessed land, or Daoist abbey. The altar must be positioned with proper orientation, facing south with its back to the north. If the abbey already has an altar but its orientation is slightly off, one may also set up the altar in a separate, secluded hall according to the prescribed form.\n\n2. When establishing an offering, one must act within one’s means: the wealthy may prepare all necessary items, while the poor may adapt as circumstances allow. The materials for the offering must not be acquired through ill-gotten wealth, nor through haggling over prices, nor through careless preparation when one has the means, nor through forced effort when one lacks them. All such actions lack sincerity and make it difficult to move the divine. If the sponsor of the fast is a household of loyalty and filial piety, and their sincerity is wholehearted, the master may provide such items as dragon silks on their behalf, simplifying all matters. The documents, offerings, and other necessities for the ritual will naturally resonate with the divine.\n\n3. The methods of visualization and the esoteric techniques employed during the offering ritual are recorded in the *Chapter on Qi Transformation and Creation*, while the musical instruments and celestial processional regalia are described in the *Chapter on Celestial Music and Processional Regalia*; these will not be detailed here.\n\n4. All documents and administrative procedures should follow the *Jade Capital* and *Mystic Model* systems, as well as the ancient forms recorded in the administrative manuals. Consult the relevant sections when needed. For instance, memorials presented before the August Thearch use the *memorial* format, while others use the *petition* format; communications with divine bureaus use the *official dispatch* format, and so on.\n\n5. Memorials should be signed with “your subject,” while petitions should bear the sender’s name. Documents from the Celestial Pivot Institute should be titled with the bureau’s name, and preceding documents such as *guan*, *tie*, and *die* should refer to “this bureau.”\n\n6. On memorials and petitions, leave a space of one hand’s width at the top and two hand’s widths at the bottom. The paper should be one foot and four inches in height; for other documents, extended stationery is preferable. Invitation and offering documents for the ritual should use standard petition paper, as prescribed.\n\n7. For the sacred titles within memorials, use yellow labels, to be filled in at the time of writing.\n\n8. The yellow strip affixed to the front of a memorial should be three inches and two *fen* in height and two inches and four *fen* in width, or alternatively three inches and six *fen* in height and three inches in width. Write the text in a single column. After affixing the yellow strip, write the sender’s name at the seam and apply the seal.\n\n9. When a memorial is accompanied by a *yi-huang* (supporting yellow document), use a small yellow label and affix it diagonally below the *Tai Sui* (Year Star) position. This follows ancient practice, though it is rarely used today.\n\n10. For memorials and petitions that list multiple sacred titles, use a yellow label affixed diagonally if there is only one title. For two, three, or four titles, use a slightly wider yellow label affixed in the center. For three or five titles, the central position is the most honorable; for two or four titles, the right is the most honorable. In the sacred section, write “Before the August Presence” or “Before the Sacred Presence,” or simply write the foremost title. For petitions to deities of the lower realms, use white labels, to be applied as appropriate.\n\n11. On the outer envelope of a memorial or petition, do not affix a yellow strip or use the term “your subject”; simply write the sender’s name. The same applies to the outer envelopes of memorials, petitions, and other documents. If a petition lists many sacred titles, only the foremost title should be written on the outer envelope.\n\n12. In memorials and petitions to the Supreme Thearch, refer to “the compassionate decree of the Dao”; to the August Thearch, “the sagely and wise decree”; to the Two Empresses, “the august and compassionate sacred decree”; to the Three Clarities and Four Emperors, “Your Majesty”; to the Two Empresses, “Your Palace”; to the various August Thearchs, “Before the August Presence”; to the Perfected, “Before the Sacred Presence”; and to deities of the lower realms, “Before the Divine Presence,” “Before the Court,” and the like. Those who have received official ranks or titles, such as *ma*, are not permitted to participate in fasting rituals.\n\n13. Even the positions below *Du Jiang* (Chief Cantor) must have received the registers of the Orthodox Unity, Numinous Treasure, and Yang Light traditions before they may participate in the altar rites.\n\n14. When inviting Daoist participants to join the fast, they must be those who are accustomed to prostration and kneeling, content with simplicity, devoted to incense and ritual fires, and free from greed for wealth and property. Only then may they take the oath and ascend the altar. They must match the sincerity of the ritual sponsor, earnestly beseeching the vast heavens to manifest their responsiveness. If they merely pursue the beauty of sound and rhythm without focused devotion, they will not only waste their energy and squander resources but may also incur blame and achieve nothing. The method of conducting rituals depends entirely on the selection of participants; this must not be taken lightly.\n\n15. Daoist youths serving as ritual attendants must first practice the *Bu Xu* hymns, the raising of voices, and the singing of *Hua Xia* and *Yin Ling* until they are proficient. When ascending the altar and circumambulating, they should follow the lead and harmonize with the chanting.\n\n16. When establishing an offering, one must exert utmost sincerity and reverence. Items such as dragon silks, jades, and swords must be of the finest quality. Incense, flowers, oil, and candles—all required supplies—must be pure and immaculate, free from any defilement. If anything is lacking at the time of use, it may instead incur divine censure. In all offerings, single-minded devotion is paramount; dragon silks are of the highest importance, followed by the reverent purity of incense and candles. Any deficiency is a flaw in the ritual. Those who serve in such rites must be especially vigilant.\n\n17. If a coffin remains in the house, one should not open an altar or establish an offering. If the residence is spacious and the funeral is held elsewhere, outside the altar’s precincts, the ritual may proceed. If there are any inauspicious or defiling influences from birth or death that have not been resolved, one must not establish an altar in the household. This must be strictly avoided.\n\n18. When burning incense, do not use fire from the kitchen hearth. When burning paper money and other offerings, do not use oil lamp or candle flames to ignite them.\n\n**Heavenly Heart Mysterious Secret Chapter**\nIn ancient times, the Primordial Heavenly King suspended a millet pearl over the black soil and commanded the August Person to expound the *Dong Zhang* (Cavern Chapters).\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao ascended the Jade Bureau in Chengdu, where he transmitted scriptures and esoteric instructions to Zhang Daoling. The Daoist methods encompass forty-two altars, and the jiao rituals seventy-two grades, disseminated throughout the mortal world to propagate teachings and transformation. Later generations of lineage-bearing Daoists accumulated merit and amassed virtuous conduct, aligning with the Dao to attain perfection. When the heart stirs, the spirit follows; the efficacy of the methods flourishes, and the teachings expand. Thus, the Daoist methods and talismanic writs branched and proliferated, spreading widely through the ages. The arts of the Dao comprise over three thousand ranks, which cannot be exhaustively recorded. Here, only one or two are briefly outlined to convey their general scope.\n\n**Fourteen Altars of Heavenly Jiao**\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Jiao Announcement Chapter* states: When mortals perform rites of exorcism, prayer, sacrifice, or ancestral deliverance, or when seeking to avert calamity or cure illness, only those who serve the Dao as Heaven’s adherents may conduct the rites of Heavenly Jiao to petition the celestial realms. For those outside the Daoist tradition who perform exorcisms, prayers, or ancestral deliverance, they are permitted only to summon the city gods, earth deities, local spirits, and officials of the underworld. They must not presumptuously invoke the Celestial Emperor or divine thearchs. Thus, the Thunder Bureau enforces the office of execution and investigation. Should any who are not Daoist adherents of Heaven dare to encroach upon the Celestial Emperor, they shall face the severing of their spirit, the annihilation of their soul, the forfeiture of their allotted lifespan, and the extinction of their years. How could one not stand in awe?\n\n**Major Jiao Rituals**\n- **Golden Register Universal Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 3,600 divine stations\n- **Jade Register Circumambient Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 2,400 divine stations\n- **Yellow Register Multitudinous Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 1,200 divine stations\n- **Grand Unity Jiao**\n- **Nine Heavens Jiao**\n- **River Chart Thirty-Six Heavens Jiao**\n- **Jade Casket Alliance of Perfected Jiao**\n- **Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Jiao**\n- **Cavern Abyss Samādhi Jiao**\n- **Disaster-Dispelling Jiao**\n- **Fortune and Steed Transfer Jiao**\n- **Nine Yous Jiao**\n- **Deliverance Jiao**\n- **Filial Piety and Ancestral Offering Jiao**\n\nAccording to the Daoist canon’s established system, the Golden Register, Jade Register, and Yellow Register Jiao each have fixed formats for their sacred stations and ritual configurations. Common jiao rituals comprise forty-eight altars, with memorial offerings and monetary petitions arranged in twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-two, sixty, seventy-two, one hundred twenty, two hundred forty, or three hundred sixty stations. The rites of the jiao mirror the solemnity of worldly protocol. The Dao is magnified through human effort; one must not cling rigidly to convention.\n\n**Thirty-Nine Ranks of Daoist Methods**\n- *Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation: Supreme Method*\n- *Unsurpassed Jade Hall of the Three Heavens: Supreme Method*\n- *Qingwei Yuanjiang: Supreme Method*\n- *Qingwei Shenlie: Supreme Method*\n- *Shangqing Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method*\n- *Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Six Ding Secret Method*\n- *Big Dipper Six Locks Secret Method*\n- *Three Expulsions and Five Liberations Secret Method*\n- *Six Jia Prayer Secret Method*\n- *Penetrating the Dipper: Marquis Wu Secret Method*\n- *Mysterious Unity Five Thunder Secret Method*\n- *Harmonizing Spirits Five Responses Secret Method*\n- *Brahma Qi Thunder Method*\n- *Shangqing Numinous Treasure Supreme Method*\n- *Jade Clarity Perfected King Purple Palace Supreme Method*\n- *Zhengming Loyalty and Filial Piety Daoist Method*\n- *Five Thunder Summoning and Interrogation Supreme Method*\n- *Jade Clarity Comprehensive Method*\n- *Five Thunder Execution and Investigation Method*\n- *Cavern Mystery Prayer Method*\n- *Primordial Unity Qi Supreme Method*\n- *Returning Chariot and Completing the Dao Orthodox Method*\n- *Nine Elders Subduing Demons Method*\n- *Heaven and Earth Teaching: Lantern and Water Method*\n- *Hunyuan Attack Qi Method*\n- *Purple Court Pursuit of Merit Method*\n- *Flying Spirit Audience with the Emperor Method*\n- *Comprehensive Memorial Method*\n- *Six Ding Six Jia Concealment Method*\n- *Palm Thunder Method*\n- *Prayer for Clear Skies, Rain, or Snow Method*\n- *Vow-Covering Method*\n- *Five Thunder Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Method*\n- *Heavenly Peng Method*\n- *Heavenly Pivot Method*\n- *Marquis Zhao Southern Method*\n- *Knot-Grinding Prayer Method*\n\nUpon examination, Daoist methods each have their own transmissions and variations. Here, only those commonly practiced in the world are recorded. Additionally, there are methods involving the Thunder Bureau and Fengdu officials, whose names are too numerous to list exhaustively.\n\n**Seven Ranks of Refinement and Salvation Methods**\n- *Qingwei Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Grand Ultimate Inner Refinement and Sacrificial Method*\n- *Jade Yang Sacrificial Refinement Method*\n- *Zhengming Yiyang Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Jade Palace Scripture Refinement Method*\n- *Three Luminaries Refinement and Salvation Method*\n\n**Fourteen Ranks of Dipper Memorial Methods**\n- *Qingwei Mysterious Pivot Memorial*\n- *Grand Unity Fire Mansion Memorial*\n- *Dipper Irrigation Five Thunder Memorial*\n- *Mysterious Numinous Deliverance Memorial*\n- *Qingwei Purple Light Memorial*\n- *Divine Empyrean Hastening to the Palace Memorial*\n- *Qingwei Prayer Memorial*\n- *Divine Empyrean Fire Bell Memorial*\n- *Jinming Memorial*\n- *Xuanji Nine Lights Memorial*\n- *Yuntian Memorial*\n- *Sun the Perfected’s Turtle Memorial*\n- *Opening the Lotus and Manifesting the Dipper Memorial*\n- *Cloud-Enveloping Manifestation of the Dipper Memorial*\n\n**Twelve Ranks of the Celestial Marrow Numinous Chapters Great Method**\n\n- *Huntian Method*: This method can open the Celestial Gate, command celestial spirits, halt the sun and detain the moon, transform day into night, summon summer snow and winter thunder.\n- *Yidi Method*: This method can point to the earth to make it quake, point to mountains to make them tremble, point to seas to dry them up, draw rivers upon the ground, shift mountains to block seas, and subdue ghosts and spirits.\n- *Wansheng Method*: This method ensures boundless victory, transforms grasses and trees, and can turn metal and stone into humans, conceal the body, and hide one’s form.\n- *Xianglong Method*: This method enables riding dragons through the sky, transforming objects into dragons, soaring through clouds and mist, and treading upon qi to ascend into the void.\n- *Fuhu Method*: This method can subdue tigers, leopards, and all fierce beasts, serpents, and insects.\n- *Qiyun Method*: This method can summon clouds and raise mist, generate five-colored auspicious clouds, ride clouds to ascend to heaven, roam the palaces of the sun and moon, and come and go at will.\n- *Shengfeng Method*: This method can conjure mighty winds across a thousand miles, raise dust to confront enemies, blow sand and stones, obscure the heavens, and respond to any situation.\n- *Furen Method*: This method can cause blades to shatter on their own, render one unharmed by weapons, and make all blades ineffective. When encountering bandits, it can prevent swords from leaving their scabbards and cause bows and crossbows to break, nullifying harm.\n- *Bianwu Method*: This method can grow all grasses and trees, ride through the air, and animate wooden figures and wooden beasts.\n- *Congbo Method*: This method can turn mountains and hills into lakes, swell rivers and streams, raise towering waves and crashing tides, summon clouds and rain, tread upon waves to cross rivers, and enter water without drowning.\n- *Lieyang Method*: This method can generate raging flames and towering fires to burn the heavens, incinerate camps and strongholds, eradicate demons and evil, and with a single passage of divine fire, dispel all misfortunes.\n- *Changchun Method*: This method can instantly grow all grasses, trees, grains, melons, fruits, and vegetables, transform earth into gold, turn stone into jade, and conceal the body within the earth.\n\nThe preceding twelve methods are sacred texts secretly transmitted by heaven, wondrous arts for transcending the world and leaving the dust behind. They can only be practiced upon receiving transmission from celestial beings. Even if one obtains the written script, it remains empty words on paper, a vain expenditure of effort.\n\n---\n\n**Thirty-Six Ranks of the Golden Inlaid Great Method of Xuanpu Mountain**\n- *Fulai*\n- *Zhenxu*\n- *Foufuxing*\n- *Yangyun*\n- *Yongshui*\n- *Ninghe*\n- *Miehuo*\n- *Yuyun Zhenzhen*\n- *Fushen*\n- *Chuquan*\n- *Huojian*\n- *Jie Huayin*\n- *Caomu Huaren*\n- *Zuoyu*\n- *Shuixing*\n- *Qiguang*\n- *Yinzhi*\n- *Bianwu*\n- *Fumeng*\n- *Jiedu*\n- *Jinceng*\n- *Zhan Yaoguai*\n- *Jingang Zha*\n- *Wu’ai Tong*\n- *Shenxing*\n- *Wujin Dan*\n- *Bujie Hu*\n- *Shuihuo Piao*\n- *Pen Quyu*\n- *Zhu Shuishi*\n- *Yangsi*\n- *Feikong Zhu*\n- *Zhihe Fei*\n- *Tie Qishen*\n- *Ruhu*\n\n---\n\n**Eighteen Ranks of the Jade Void Celestial Script Great Method**\n- Concealing Form and Hiding the Body\n- Driving Spirits into Chambers\n- Wandering Souls through the Three Realms\n- Transcending Life and Death, Borrowing Corpses\n- Fire Borrowing Corpse\n- Water Borrowing\n- Metal Borrowing\n- Fire Borrowing\n- Wood Borrowing\n- Earth Borrowing\n- Wooden Ox and Flowing Horse\n- Self-Boiling Cauldron without Fire or Water\n- Commanding Stones to Move with a Shout\n- Refining Mud into Gold\n- Transforming Copper and Iron into Treasures\n- Moving Trees and Objects a Thousand Miles\n- Wooden Rooster Crowing at Dawn\n- Clay Dog Barking at Night\n\n**Sixteen Ranks of the Great Method of Secret Spiritual Protection**\n- Transformation\n- Dream Attachment\n- Shapeshifting\n- Flying through the Void\n- Entering Stone Walls\n- Concealing Form\n- Reviving the Dead\n- Night Travel without Candlelight\n- Immortality and Undying\n- Dulling Thieves’ Minds\n- Binding Thieves to Come of Their Own Accord\n- Commanding the Five Penetrations to Pursue Myriad Things\n- Summoning Spirits\n- Burrowing through Earth to Find Corpses\n- Divine Marvels\n- Ears Reporting\n\n**Thirty-Three Ranks of the Great Method of the Heaven-Penetrating Treasured Register**\n- Longevity and Enduring Vision\n- Prolonging Years and Enhancing Life\n- Ascending to Heaven and Entering Earth\n- Emerging from Darkness into Light\n- Spirit-Wandering to the Lunar Palace\n- Crossing Rivers on a Reed\n- Thousand-Mile Spirit Rendezvous\n- Borrowing Tides to Summon Wind, Sailing Ten Thousand *Li* in a Day\n- Rebirth by Seizing Another’s Body\n- Traveling Ten Thousand *Li* in a Day\n- Treading Swan’s Down to Soar through the Void\n- Riding a Grass Dragon to Fly through the Heavens\n- Refining Mud into Gold\n- Nine-Cycled Spirit Elixir\n- Congealing Mercury into Silver\n- Transmuting Copper and Iron into Gold and Silver\n- Nurturing Cinnabar through Pouring and Dripping\n- Gushing Spring Elixir Essence\n- Condensing Goods into Treasures\n- Powdered Refinement and Transmutation\n- Spirit Sand and Treasured Tripod\n- Transmuting Xin into Geng\n- Summoning Cranes\n- Round Illumination\n\n**Spirit Possession, Dancing with Immortal Youths, Crossing into the Yin Realm, Pursuit and Seizure, Descending Brush, Supreme Ultimate *Luan*, Brush-Rack *Luan*, Suspended-Thread *Luan*, Sealed-Casket *Luan*.**\n\n**Daoist Ecclesiastic Ranks and Ming Dynasty Hierarchy**\n*Principal Second Rank*: Hereditary Celestial Master of the Han Lineage, Perfected Person.\n*Principal Sixth Rank*: Left and Right *Zhengyi* of the Daoist Registry.\n*Subordinate Sixth Rank*: Left and Right *Yanfa* of the Daoist Registry, Superintendents of Palaces and Observatories.\n*Principal Eighth Rank*: Left and Right *Zhiling* of the Daoist Registry.\n*Subordinate Eighth Rank*: Left and Right *Xuanyi* of the Daoist Registry.\n*Subordinate Ninth Rank*: *Duji* of the Daoist Discipline Office.\n*Unranked*: Vice *Duji* of the Daoist Discipline Office, *Daozheng* of the Daoist Rectification Office, *Daohui* of the Daoist Assembly Office.\n\n**Perfected Persons**\nDuring the Han, Zhang Daoling was granted the title \"Perfected Person\" as Celestial Master. In the Tang, Mi was bestowed the same title upon his return to the Dao as Chancellor, with an additional rank of Principal First Grade.\n\n**Libationers**\nIn the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, Tong Bo was appointed Libationer to preside over kinship rites. Later, during King Xuan’s grand sacrifice at the Southern Suburbs, Zhong Shanfu served as Libationer to oversee the ritual. Thus, in subsequent ages, Daoists assumed the office of Libationer to conduct the rites of suburban sacrifices to Heaven, thereby governing the Daoist teachings. This marked the inception of the Libationer’s role among Daoists.\n\n**Daoist Officials**\nKing Mu of Zhou appointed the Daoist Gao Gongchen as Libationer to worship the Primordial Heavenly Sovereign at the thatched hut of Perfected Person Yin. This was the origin of Daoist officialdom.\n\n**Daoist Registrars**\nEmperor Taizong of Song expanded the Daoist registry to include eight officers: Vice Registrar, Supervisor, Chief Seat, and Senior *Tongjiu*, all of whom collectively administered the affairs of the Daoist community.\n\n**Daoist Ennoblement**\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wu of the Later Zhou, Wei Yuansong was enfeoffed as Duke of Shu Commandery—the first instance of a Daoist receiving a noble title. Ye Fashan was later enfeoffed as Duke of Yue during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong.\n\n**Daoist Posthumous Honors**\nIn the Tang, Wang Zhiyuan was posthumously honored as Master of Ascending Mystery. Ye Fashan was granted the titles Grand Master for Glorious Happiness, Gold and Purple, and Prefect of Yuezhou. These were the first instances of posthumous honors bestowed upon Daoists.\n\n**Daoist Posthumous Titles**\nUpon his ascension, Tao Hongjing was posthumously titled Master of Upright Purity by the Liang Emperor. This marked the beginning of such posthumous designations.\n\n**Daoist Discipline**\n\nThe Master Laozi said, \"One who knows the ancient beginning is said to grasp the Dao’s discipline.\" Thus, just as the Buddhist clergy established monastic regulations, the Daoist tradition developed its own designations.\n\n**Daoist Titles**\nThe Yellow Emperor addressed the Herdboy as \"Celestial Master\"—this was the first instance. Later, during the Han, Zhang Daoling was also called Celestial Master. Daoist names and titles all derive from the principles of Laozi’s *Daodejing*. Characters such as *Dao*, *Mysterious (xuan)*, and *Subtle (miao)*—these are not teachings of China’s native tradition, yet foreign peoples have appropriated them.\n\n**Purple Robes**\nDuring the Tang, Li Bi was born with divine spirit. As a child, his body was so light he could levitate, and his mother often heard celestial music in the air. Fearing he would ascend and depart, she sprinkled his head with juice of scallions and garlic. Later, under Emperor Daizong, he was appointed as chief minister. Li Fuguang, who monopolized power, grew envious of him. Li Bi, recognizing he could not long remain in office, resigned and sought to become a Daoist. The emperor then bestowed upon him a purple robe and golden belt—the first instance of a Daoist being granted purple attire.\n\n**Yellow-Crowned Daoists**\nThe *Inner Records of the Yellow Emperor* states: \"All who serve the Heavenly Dao are called *daoshi* (Daoists).\" During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, at the thatched abbey of Master Yin the Perfected, he summoned reclusive worthies to tend the incense and flames in worship of the Heavenly Thearch—this was the first instance of *daoshi* officiating at a temple to venerate the Heavenly Thearch.\n\nThe robes and crowns of Daoists are those of the Yellow Emperor, hence the name *yellow-crowned*. What they practice are the affairs of the Yellow Emperor; what they expound is the Dao of Laozi—thus they are called *daoshi*. They do not alter their attire, nor dare they wear anything but the ritual vestments of the former kings. They do not alter their speech, nor dare they utter anything but the words of the former kings.\n\nThose who follow the Dao do not abandon their surnames, for they do not forget their kin; they do not mutilate their bodies, for they do not forget filial piety. Taking the Dao as their teaching, they do not defy Heaven; refusing to serve foreign doctrines, they do not defy their native land. As Chinese people serving the Chinese Dao, they embody the Way of Heaven and follow the advantages of Earth to cultivate themselves. Thus, they can ascend in flight, ride the void and command the winds, transcend the material world in spirit, and ascend to pay homage in the Great Clarity. They attain the wonders of creation, becoming companions of Heaven, able to commune with the numinous powers of Heaven and Earth, align with the virtue of the divine, command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and lightning, conjure wind and rain, grasp the stars and slay malevolent spirits, dispel plagues and pestilence, and bring about great peace—these are the proven truths since the opening of the world by the Three Sovereigns. Herein lies the manifestation of the Dao as teaching.\n\n**Supervisor of Ceremonies**\nEmperor Wen of Sui first appointed Wang Yan, the abbot of Xuandu Abbey, as the official of ritual decorum—equivalent to the present-day role of *Jianzhai* (Liturgist).\n\n**Daoist Registrar**\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the term was changed to *Daolu* to avoid a naming taboo.\n\n**Supervisor of Rites**\nDuring the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, the position of *Shouzuo Jianyi* (Chief Seat Supervisor of Rites) was established to oversee matters of their respective ranks.\n\n**Senior Seat**\nFirst instituted under Emperor Taizong of Song.\n\n**Ritual Officer**\n\nZhang Daoling of the Han dynasty first practiced the arts of commanding thunder and deploying ghosts, and those who performed such methods were called *Faguan* (Ritual Officers).\n\n**The Red Script Celestial Statutes**\nOnly the transgressions of the living against the celestial precepts are recorded; those committed by ghosts and spirits are not, as seen in the *Nüqing Celestial Statutes*.\n\n1. On the seasonal amnesty days of Heaven and Earth, Ritual Officers must not deploy talismans, incantations, or ritual water, nor consult the statutes. Violators shall first suffer themselves, then bring calamity and annihilation to their nine generations.\n\n2. When Ritual Officers perform rituals, they must act in accordance with yang and report in accordance with yin, without beginning earnestly and ending carelessly. Violators shall be annihilated, and calamity shall extend to their nine generations.\n\n3. When Ritual Officers submit petitions for promotion or disciples assume ranks, their names are registered under the Left Judgment Officer. They may then be promoted to Left Grand Judgment Officer, followed by Right Grand Judgment Officer. Violators shall each be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly endorse such petitions shall be stripped of their ranks, annihilated, and their crimes shall extend to three generations.\n\n4. If Ritual Officers, Daoists, or laypersons burn incense, submit memorials, or present petitions to the celestial bureaus on the six *wu* days, they shall be annihilated. Those who knowingly violate this shall bring calamity to their nine generations, suffering the \"Wind Blade\" for ten thousand kalpas without absolution. Those not bearing tally tokens shall be reduced by three ranks.\n\n5. If Ritual Officers, when not slaying ghosts, invoke the phrase *\"Hasten as the statute commands!\"* at inappropriate times, their lifespans shall be reduced by six years.\n\n6. If Ritual Officers, when inscribing talismans, point the brush tip to the left, they shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their lifespans reduced by twelve years.\n\n7. If Ritual Officers, when consecrating water, rotate the water vessel to the left, they shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their lifespans reduced by twelve years.\n\n8. If Ritual Officers recklessly reveal orthodox methods to unworthy persons, their lifespans shall be reduced by twelve years.\n\n9. Ritual Officers must not privately worship ghosts and spirits, except for the sacrifices to Ao in the second and eighth months. Violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude; intentional violators shall receive an additional penalty.\n\n10. Wherever Ritual Officers reside, if they encounter floods, droughts, banditry, or other harms afflicting the people, they are permitted to immediately report and petition for celestial punishment of the cunning and malevolent. Violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. If an officer is dispatched to execute punishment but the offender does not match the reported description, the penalty shall be increased by one degree. If the offender fully matches the report, the officer shall be promoted by two ranks.\n\n11. If Ritual Officers perform rituals carelessly, summoning divine officials and soldiers without selecting proper paper or brushes to write talismans or consecrate water, the celestial authorities shall revoke their sustenance, leaving them impoverished in their lifetimes.\n\n12. If Ritual Officers recklessly mobilize divine officials and soldiers, harming the living, their lifespans shall be reduced by six years.\n\n13. Ritual Officers must not enter the temples of orthodox deities without cause, nor recklessly apprehend such deities using orthodox methods. Violators shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. If Ritual Officers enter such temples without proper ceremonial welcome or send-off, the penalty shall not apply.\n\n14. If Ritual Officers receive petitions from the people but fail to act upon them promptly, they shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude. If the petition does not conform to the proper format, this does not apply.\n\n15. If Ritual Officers, upon encountering private worship of heterodox spirits or licentious ghosts, do not immediately dispatch divine officials to apprehend and punish them according to the statutes, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n16. If Ritual Officers observe the fasts and precepts but violate them, they shall be sentenced to seven years of penal servitude.\n\n17. If Ritual Officers, when treating yang illnesses, intentionally use yang talismans, or for yin illnesses use yin talismans, or employ leftward destruction when rightward generation is required, thereby harming others, they shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. If no clear retribution has occurred and the distinction between yin and yang is unclear, this does not apply.\n\n18. If Ritual Officers recklessly add or remove words when performing rituals, thereby slandering their peers, they shall be sentenced to five years of penal servitude. If they debate the rightness or wrongness of public matters or dispute orthodox methods, this does not apply.\n\n19. If Ritual Officers recklessly transmit orthodox methods to unworthy persons for personal gain, their lifespans shall be reduced by twelve years.\n\n20. Ritual Officers of the seventh rank shall record merits but not transgressions. If they submit memorials knowing their rank and yet commit offenses, their lifespans shall be reduced by six years.\n\n21. If Ritual Officers treat orthodox methods as playthings, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n22. If Ritual Officers, when petitioned by the people for talismans or ritual water, recklessly obstruct due to personal difficulties, they shall be sentenced to six years of penal servitude. If they are petitioned for talismans but disdain the orthodox methods and refuse to provide them, this does not apply.\n\n23. If Ritual Officers, when inscribing talismans, intentionally write upside-down or horizontally, or if red talismans are not written from the left or black talismans not from the right, they shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.\n\n24. When Ritual Officers submit petitions for disciples to transmit the Dao and receive ranks, those from the Northern Bureau shall have their ranks calculated by the Northern Bureau, and those from the Southern Bureau by the Southern Bureau. Violators shall be sentenced to eight years of penal servitude.\n\n25. When Ritual Officers submit petitions for disciples to transmit the Dao, they must assess the disciple’s character and integrity before endorsing them. If they recklessly submit petitions due to personal connections or influence, they shall each be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. If the disciple is worthy, the officer shall be promoted by three ranks.\n\n26. When Ritual Officers submit the names of disciples, they must do so on *gengshen* or *jiazi* days. Regardless of the disciple’s current rank, they may be permitted to bear the orthodox methods and submit petitions for promotion to the fourth or fifth rank.\n\n27. If Ritual Officers submit petitions for promotions or irregular advancements on days other than *gengshen* or *jiazi*, they shall each be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. Repeated petitions shall result in a lifespan reduction of six years.\n\n28. When Ritual Officers transmit the orthodox methods to disciples, they must have personally borne them for over one thousand days before endorsing the disciple. Violators shall be stripped of their ranks and titles, and sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n29. When Ritual Officers transmit the orthodox methods to disciples, they must confer the *Commander’s Seal* and the *General Talisman*, enabling the disciple to command divine officials, deploy ghosts and spirits, and wield the *Commander’s Seal* inscription: *\"Seal of the Celestial Capital’s General Command,\"* arranged in two lines of stacked seal script.\n\nThe *General Talisman* is the *Talisman of the Three Primes*. It is inscribed in seal script on yellow silk. At both ends of the talisman, a black imperial decree is written, granting it to a designated recipient for the command and execution of all gods and spirits. After ordination, the master writes the disciple’s name and affixes their seal; violation of this renders the divine officials unresponsive to the transmitter’s commands, rendering the transmission void. Not only will the ritual be ineffectual, but celestial punishment will surely descend.\n\n1. If Ritual Officers transmit teachings to disciples but fail to complete the instruction, or do not exhaust what should be taught, they shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. If disciples begin learning but do not persist to the end, the same penalty applies. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their sentence increased by one degree. If disciples do not inquire, or masters do not transmit, [the same applies].\n\n2. When Ritual Officers transmit teachings to disciples, regardless of whether they are male or female officials, they must select worthy recipients and may not recklessly divulge the teachings. Violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n3. If Ritual Officers speak insincerely, with words at odds with their hearts, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. If circumstances leave no alternative, this does not apply.\n\n4. If Ritual Officers arrogantly exalt themselves and berate their disciples, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n5. If Ritual Officers encounter extraordinary individuals in the world, they are permitted to submit memorials or petitions. If such a person is implicated in a case, the outer envelope of the memorial shall be inscribed with a vermilion petition, bypassing the celestial bureaus and proceeding directly to the Most High’s presence to await the appointment of an official for promotion, filling a vacancy in the Eighth Rank of the Upper Prime’s immortal offices. If, in daily memorials or petitions, one bypasses the review of the various bureaus, they shall be sentenced to eight years of penal servitude.\n\n6. If Ritual Officers transmit secret methods to disciples but conceal the truth and present falsehoods—whether omitting a single character, reciting the correct incantation but teaching the wrong method, or teaching the correct method but reciting the wrong incantation—they shall be sentenced to six years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their sentence increased by one degree.\n\n7. Ritual Officers ranked among the Immortal Ministers may memorialize for the appointment of demon-subduing envoys. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n8. Ritual Officers ranked among the Lords of the Dao may memorialize for the appointment of officials of the Five Peaks and Four Waterways, as well as replacements for existing immortal or spirit officials in the celestial bureaus. This is permitted.\n\n9. Ritual Officers ranked among the Lofty Perfected may memorialize for the appointment of Lords of the Cavernous Yang and the like. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n10. Ritual Officers ranked among the Petition Officers may submit memorials and petitions. Violators shall be sentenced to six years of penal servitude.\n\n11. Ritual Officers who have not received the *Register of Merit Completion* may not submit yellow memorials or present petitions. Violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall be annihilated. Even if unaware, their accumulated transgressions will fill the measure, and the Three Officials shall dispatch agents to seize them, condemning them to suffer for ten thousand kalpas or be cast into the Coal and Stone Hells.\n\n12. Ritual Officers ranked in the Seventh Rank may not address memorials to the Celestial Bureaus or the Five Peaks; only those of the Sixth Rank and above may do so. Violators shall have their lifespan reduced by six years. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n13. Ritual Officers ranked among the Southern Bureau and those with official ranks are permitted to submit memorials at their discretion.\n\n14. Ritual Officers ranked among the Northern Bureau and those with official ranks are permitted to transfer to the Southern Bureau for separate consideration by the Most High. Violators shall be stripped of their names and ranks, and their past transgressions shall nullify their merits.\n\n15. Ritual Officers ranked in the Ninth Rank may not address memorials to the Earthly Bureaus; only those of the Eighth Rank and above may do so. Violators shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n16. Ritual Officers ranked in the Eighth Rank may memorialize for the appointment of the Left Grand Judgment Officer. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n17. Ritual Officers ranked in the Fifth Rank may memorialize for the appointment of Seventh Rank offices. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n18. Ritual Officers with official ranks may memorialize for the appointment of Sixth Rank offices. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n19. Ritual Officers ranked among the Four Upper Immortals may memorialize for the appointment of Prime Ministers. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n20. Ritual Officers ranked among the Perfected may memorialize for the appointment of envoys.

Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes. [Permission to memorialize for Immortal Ministers.]\n\n23. Ritual Officers ranked among the Lords of the Various Bureaus may memorialize for the appointment of Prime Ministers, Perfected Ones, and Judges of Fengdu. Violations shall be punished according to the preceding statutes.\n\n24. If those transmitting the Dao fail to treat their ordination masters with the reverence due a teacher, despite their masters’ pure and sincere devotion, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. Those who deceive or slander their masters or preceptors shall be sentenced to eight years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by two degrees.\n\n25. If Ritual Officers do not reciprocate the kindness of others but instead demand repayment from their disciples, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n26. If Ritual Officers boast of their own merits to others, they shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude.\n\n27. If disciples recklessly curse their masters or preceptors, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n28. If Ritual Officers abuse their authority to humiliate their inferiors or are unfilial to their parents, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years.\n\n29. If Ritual Officers perform talismanic water rituals but do not fully understand the talismanic script, they must seek instruction from a master more accomplished than themselves. If they feign understanding when ignorant or claim mastery when unskilled, arrogantly asserting superiority over others, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n30. If Ritual Officers submit memorials or petitions but fail to observe proper decorum during audience rites, they shall be censured by the Three Officials. Those of lower rank shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude.\n\n31. If Ritual Officers, Daoists, or laypersons conduct rituals for others but ascend the altar with improper attire or demeanor, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years. Those who consume meat or alcohol shall be eternally consigned to Fengdu, and their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer punishment. If they ascend the altar before it is opened, this does not apply.\n\n32. If Ritual Officers or Daoists perform rituals carelessly, submitting memorials or petitions for others without following the proper forms, seeking profit, or lacking sincerity, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n33. If Ritual Officers or Daoists enter the altar to present memorials or petitions but use redundant language, fail to observe proper audience decorum, harbor impure thoughts, touch the Gate of Heaven with their hands, or ascend the altar with their right foot first, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n1. If Ritual Officers or Daoists submit documents stating they present vermilion memorials at a specified time when it is not the proper time, they shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude.\n\n2. Ritual Officers or Daoists who receive the *Three Caverns* and *Great Cavern Registers and Scriptures* may command and dispatch all ranks of celestial officials and spirits throughout the world, whether they possess the scriptures without the registers or the registers without the scriptures, the same applies.\n\n3. Ritual Officers or Daoists who ascend to the celestial bureaus to present memorials and petitions or pay homage to the Highest Perfected Ones through secret talismans and incantations must first obtain approval from the relevant offices before proceeding. Those of official rank below the seventh grade are exempt. Those who violate this shall be expelled. Those who proceed without authorization shall be disbarred.\n\n4. If Ritual Officers or Daoists who present memorials and petitions through the secret talismans and incantations of the Most High receive responses but disclose them to others, their lifespan shall be reduced by twelve years.\n\n5. When Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials and petitions, only those submitted through the Celestial Pivot Institute, the Yellow Memorials of the Mysterious Capital, or the headers of memorials and petitions for ritual offerings may not contain a single erroneous character. Violations shall render the ritual void, and the memorials shall fail to reach the officiating Ritual Officer. Both the Ritual Officer and the petitioner shall be sentenced to five years of penal servitude.\n\n6. If Ritual Officers or Daoists list incorrect ranks or falsely claim official titles, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years.\n\n7. Only Ritual Officers, Daoists, or laypersons who have received the *Orthodox Unity Register* may submit official documents or present yellow memorials.

When Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials and petitions for others, they must do so according to proper form. For other ritual offerings, they may perform services according to their capacity. If the petitioner is poor or of low status and unable to afford more, even a single lamp or flower suffices. However, those who lack sincerity shall be sentenced to five years of penal servitude.\n\n13. If Ritual Officers or Daoists conduct rituals and ascend the altar without reverence, engage in frivolous speech, laughter, or clamor, cast sidelong glances, stand with their backs turned, spit, summon servants, or fail to observe the decorum of a subject, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n14. If Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials and petitions that do not conform to the proper format, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.

When Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials for salvation and deliverance, they may only fill eighty *Golden Register* and *White Simpl* sets, or eighty *Yellow Register* sets for offering rituals. For memorials of eighty-one sections, only eight hundred sets may be offered. Exceeding these numbers shall render the memorials unusable, and both the Ritual Officer and the ritual sponsor shall be sentenced to nine years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n16. Ritual Officers or Daoists below the fifth rank who have not received the *Capital Merit Register* may not submit documents to the *Nüqing* or issue summons to souls. Violators shall have their lifespan reduced by six years. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n17. Ritual Officers of the fifth rank or above who issue summons must include the following in their vermilion documents: *\"Having reverently observed the Crimson Writ of the Primal Chaos and the Nüqing Summons, permission is granted to proclaim this throughout the boundless worlds and the courts of the ritual officiants, to deliver the deceased to the Celestial Palaces and advance them into the Daoist abodes, in accordance with the Most High’s compassion for all beings.\"* If this language is omitted, the summons shall not be effective in the netherworld, and both the Ritual Officer and the ritual sponsor shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n18. Offering tablets must be nine inches in length, two *fen* in thickness, and two inches and four *fen* in width. The front shall bear the incantation, and the back shall be inscribed with talismanic script. They shall be wrapped in blue silk or gauze; if resources are insufficient, paper may be used. Violations of this format shall render the tablets unusable in the Southern Chang Prefecture of the netherworld, and the ritual shall be void. Both the Ritual Officer and the ritual sponsor shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n19. When laypersons conduct rituals, they may not burn sandalwood, benzoin, or frankincense. Only *hundred-harmonies incense* may be used, as this invites the descent and witness of the Highest Perfected Ones. Those with means may burn *descending-perfected incense*. Violators shall bring retribution upon three generations of their family, while the Ritual Officers or Daoists involved shall have their lifespan reduced by three years.\n\n20. If laypersons slander the Orthodox Dao and turn from the true to the heterodox, five generations of their family shall be punished, and they themselves shall encounter misfortune in all affairs. Their parents, spouse, and children shall suffer the consequences, and after death, they shall be sent to Fengdu, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n21. If laypersons mistake the true for the false and the false for the true, and slander Ritual Officers, after death they shall be sent to Fengdu for punishment. Seven generations of their ancestors and nine generations of their forebears shall suffer calamity, and they themselves shall encounter many misfortunes in life. Those who wear the talismanic cord shall have their penalty increased by two degrees; those who commit severe offenses shall have their lifespan reduced according to the gravity of their crimes.\n\n22. If laypersons abuse their power to damage Daoist abbeys, destroy scriptures, slander Daoists, or oppress the innocent, their lifespan shall be reduced. In severe cases, they shall be annihilated, and nine generations of their ancestors shall suffer calamity.\n\n23. If laypersons act cunningly to harm others, nine generations of their ancestors shall suffer calamity. After death, they shall sink into the netherworld, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas. Ritual Officers or Daoists who witness such acts shall have their own lives forfeit.\n\n24. If laypersons utter foul or vulgar language in Daoist abbeys, sacred mountains, or places where scriptures and talismans are kept, they shall be sentenced to one year of penal servitude. Ritual Officers or Daoists who do the same shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n25. If laypersons presumptuously imitate Ritual Officers by pacing the stars, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.

If laypersons burn incense with fire from the stove, urinate in its presence, or are seen by those observing the precepts, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude. The penalty for Ritual Officers or Daoists shall be increased by one degree.\n\n28. If laypersons consume meat or alcohol and ascend the Three Clarities Hall or face the Supreme Perfected Ones, they shall be sentenced to six years of penal servitude. Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree. The penalty for Ritual Officers or Daoists shall be increased by two degrees.\n\n29. If laypersons recklessly sacrifice to licentious ghosts or deities not recorded in the sacrificial canons, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n30. If laypersons, in their suffering, seek talismanic water without sincerity, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n31. If laypersons hold fasts or establish jiao rites without sincerity, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n32. If laypersons bring scriptures, texts, secret formulas, or talismans into defiled or unclean places, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. The penalty for Ritual Officers or Daoists shall be increased by one degree.\n\n33. If laypersons transmit or receive secret methods without submitting their names, or secretly view sacred texts, they shall be sentenced to three years of penal servitude.\n\n34. If laypersons do not practice orthodox methods or secretly keep secret methods in their homes, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n35. If laypersons resent the sovereign, are unfilial to their elders, unkind to their siblings, untrustworthy to their teachers and friends, unharmonious with their spouses, or instead of aiding the poor, despise and humiliate them, they shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude. In severe cases, they shall forfeit their lives.\n\n**Regulations and Ritual Norms Chapter**\nThe Supreme Pole Master of the Dao says: The regulations for fasts and jiao rites are of utmost gravity. All these prohibitions are the ancient statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace, meant to admonish negligence, correct transgressions, examine conduct, and observe sincerity. If there are faults, they shall be rectified according to the matter at hand. This is not to punish those who partake in fasts but to open the door for correcting faults. If one knows their errors and reforms, their offenses shall also be absolved. Thus, the great discipline of the Dao may be upheld, its profound transformation spread, and those who ascend the altar should take heed and be warned.\n\n**Titles of Jiao Altar Offices**\n\n**High Merit (Gaogong)** – Also called Left Expounder of the Dao\nHis duty: His virtue is inwardly full, his dignity outwardly complete.

Should any public duty be neglected, one may not appropriate garments not one’s own.\n\nIn all matters of ascent, movement, or repose upon the altar, one must first report to the Dharma Master, bow once in reverence before the incense, then depart after three bows.

The Emperor said to Wang Dao: \"I have often said that the human body is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Land is difficult to attain. Yet now the people of the Central Land turn away from the Dao of the Central Land, wishing to be reborn in the West as Hu barbarians rather than live in the Central Land—how utterly foolish! Is this not what Emperor Zhang of Han meant by 'the Dao transforms the wise, while Buddhism transforms the foolish'?\"\n\nWang Dao replied: \"Truly, these are words of truth, worthy to serve as a warning for ten thousand generations.\" Thus, the saying \"the Dao transforms the wise, while Buddhism transforms the foolish\" arose from this time. Though such words have since become common, Daoists must never utter them, lest they invite calamity—this must be strictly avoided.\n\nAccording to the Perfected One Huangfu: \"The sages established teachings in accordance with local customs and natural dispositions. Those whose endowment is dull, rooted in earth, find joy in death; those whose nature is keen, rooted in heaven, find joy in life. As the *Book of Changes* says: 'That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in earth inclines downward.' Those who find joy in death—did not the Buddha in the *Nirvana Sutra* speak of 'sitting in extinction, extinction itself being bliss'? Those who find joy in life—did not Laozi say, 'My fate lies with me, not with Heaven'? The Way of life and death exists for both the wise and the foolish; why then must we insist on distinguishing their joys?\"\n\nThis passage expounds the matter most reasonably, and so it is adopted here.\n\n**Prohibition on Disputation**\nA great taboo is to engage in disputes with others. The teaching of the *Daodejing* states: \"Only by not contending does the world find none able to contend with him.\" The *Qingzheng Jing* says: \"The superior person does not contend; the inferior person delights in contention.\" Should one encounter hostility or slander in speech, one should respond thus: \"I have often said that the human body is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Land is difficult to attain. Having been born in the Central Land, one rarely encounters the true Dao. I am a person of the Central Land, born in the Central Land, and I follow the Dao of the sages of the Central Land. This is to neither betray the Heaven that gave me life nor the earth that bore me. For a person of the Central Land to follow the Dao of the Central Land is only right. To turn one’s back on the land of one’s birth and follow another teaching is to be no better than a beast, forgetting the virtue of Heaven and Earth that gave one life—how can such a one be called a cultivator? As for the superiority or inferiority of teachings, I know not. But this answer alone places principle above personal bias.\"\n\n**Seating Order for Daoists and Buddhists**\nWhenever Buddhists visit an abbey or observatory, Daoists should yield the higher seat to them. When Daoists visit a temple, Buddhists should likewise yield the higher seat to them. This is the courtesy due to visiting guests. If they meet elsewhere, both Daoists and Buddhists should defer to the elder, yielding the higher seat. Though their teachings differ as between Chinese and barbarian, harmony is the highest principle, and humility is the virtue of the cultivated.\n\n**Designations of Monks and Daoists**\nIn the fifth year of Yonghui during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, a Hu monk and a Daoist disputed over their titles, saying: \"One only hears people call us 'monk-Daoist,' never 'Daoist-monk.' Why should the Hu monk be ranked above the Daoist?\" The Emperor said: \"The Daoist is a person of Our Central Land, while you are a Hu barbarian. How can a man of the barbarian tribes be placed above a person of the Central Land? In the rites of the Central Land, the honored are distinguished from the lowly. Barbarians are not even permitted to wear caps or shoes in the same manner as the Chinese—how much less should they be ranked above them!\"\n\nThe Emperor said to Yu Zhining: \"Consider the common saying 'barbarian and Chinese.' The Chinese are the Central Land, yet they are placed below the barbarians—is this right? Or take the terms 'yin and yang': yin is the petty man, inauspicious; yang is the noble man, auspicious. Should yang be placed below yin? Or take 'fortune and misfortune': why not speak of fortune first and misfortune after? Is misfortune to be considered auspicious? Or take 'ghosts and spirits': ghosts are lowly spirits, while spirits are celestial. Why should lowly ghosts be placed above celestial spirits? Or take 'crooked and straight, slanted and upright': upright and straight are good, while slanted and crooked are not. Should the inauspicious names come first? In all common sayings, the inauspicious and unpropitious are placed first. The ranking of monks and Daoists, high and low, follows the same principle. From this, one may discern the order of auspicious and inauspicious, noble and base, Chinese and barbarian. By this example, how can the dignity of the Dao be sullied?\"\n\n**Prohibition on Discussing Karma and Retribution**\nEmperor Wuzong of Tang said: \"In the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang, the name 'Righteous Students' was established. Each was required to fabricate ten tales of hellish karma and retribution to delude the world, bewitching the foolish to seek alms. Over eight hundred such tales were compiled and scattered throughout barbarian books like the *Dharma Garden* and *Forest of Gems*. The original transmission of the Buddhist teachings had the patriarchs going barefoot, carrying alms bowls, and begging for food as their practice—how could deluding the world to seek wealth be considered cultivation? Yet the foolish men and women of the world are all deceived, some even squandering their fortunes to make offerings. The Dao of the Daoist household is the Dao of the sages of the Central Land. One must never speak of ghosts, demons, strange omens, hellish karma, or retribution, nor beg in the streets to shame the ancestral teachings. Such conduct is that of shameless vagrants, not of the people of the Central Land. It must be strictly prohibited.\"\n\n**Prohibition on False Relics**\nThere was a Daoist named Tao Yuansu who met another Daoist claiming to be Huangfu Xin. He led Tao to a pine tree, where they saw a white-bearded man who felt Tao’s head and said: \"This child has extraordinary bones in his skull. One day, he may study the Dao.\"\n\nThe parents then offered him to the Temple of Supreme Heaven, where he became a disciple of the Daoist Teng Bixiao. At nineteen, he encountered an elder who bestowed upon him the *Book of Celestial Marrow and Numinous Scripture*. Later, he wandered to Mount Kongtong and subsequently resided on Mount Taihua. By the thirteenth year of the Tianjian reign of the Liang Dynasty (the year jiawu), he was one hundred and eighty-two years old. The Emperor, having heard of his transcendent and ethereal Dao, dispatched envoys with an imperial edict to summon him, but he declined. He then composed a poem:\n\n*\"Through Jin, Qi, and Liang—nearly two centuries passed,\nYet worldly affairs still kept me apart.\nToday, I shed this mortal coil,\nAnd ascend to the Great Veil beside the Heavenly Emperor.\"*\n\nThereupon, he instructed his disciples: \"I shall now depart. Cremate my body and do not preserve my remains.\" He then removed his robe, sat cross-legged, and passed away. This occurred on the first day of the first month in the fourteenth year of the Tianjian reign (the year yiwei). His disciples cremated him, and among his bones were found pearls of red and white, some as large as soybeans, radiant and lustrous, as hard as stone—three hundred and ninety-nine in total. The envoys presented them to the court.\n\nFan Yun remarked: \"The Western Hu possess secret arts of the bedchamber, wherein they absorb yin through the union of qi, producing objects of red and purple hues, heavy in weight. The Hu call these *śarīra*. The Western Hu also have a hard stone indistinguishable from these, often using *dragon’s blood resin* to dye bones, which deceivers in China, skilled in self-cultivation, claim to be formed from the pure yang essence of virgin youths—red and white in color, calling them *yang essence* or *śarīra*. Yet these are nothing but the foul remnants of the dead. How could they be presented to the court? If one has attained the Dao, they must ascend to heaven, leaving no withered bones behind. If death occurs, and the corpse is burned, the foul remnants remain—how can this be called attainment? Among common households, even a single dead man’s bones left in a dwelling are called *hidden corpses*, inauspicious objects that must be exorcised by shamans. How much worse to bring them into the court! The envoys should be executed.\"\n\nThe Emperor thus refused the offering. Thereupon, the Celestial Master issued a decree to all temples and abbeys across the land: \"Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, the sages of the Central Land have never regarded death as attainment of the Dao. If one claims to have attained the Dao, why would they still die? They would merely be called lesser ghosts. Moreover, to leave behind the remains of a corpse, forming so-called *yang essence*, and deceive the foolish masses—henceforth, anyone who dares to delude others with *yang essence* or *śarīra* shall be condemned as a heretic.\"\n\n**Admonitions on Ritual Burning and Cultivation**\nAccording to the principles of ritual burning and cultivation: The duty of the Daoist is to burn incense and light lamps morning and evening, offer water and flowers, recite scriptures, and perform repentance rites to seek blessings and merit. The halls must be kept immaculate, with sacred images and ritual implements spotless and orderly, not a speck of dust allowed to settle. They must be constantly dusted and swept, ensuring no filth or grime accumulates on the floors or within the halls and chambers. This is called laboring with devotion before the Heavenly Emperor, entrusting oneself to a realm of purity and nobility—the true duty of a Daoist. Those who uphold this will surely receive blessings and rewards. To neglect even one of these duties is to invite calamity from heaven.\n\nMoreover, one must devote all effort to tending vegetable gardens and exhaust all care in cooking and hearth-tending, gathering firewood and drawing water, enduring hardship in body and mind, toiling with limbs and flesh—this is called accumulating the merit of diligent labor, by which one repays the grace of Heaven and Earth for the gift of life. If one’s merit is great, the blessings and rewards shall be profound. Should one fail in both these duties, one bears the name of Daoist in vain, secretly enjoying the blessings of heaven and humanity. After the body perishes, one shall receive the retribution of an animal’s fate, escaping neither the suffering of the butcher’s block nor the torment of punishment—how can one not fear this!\n\nHere is appended the *Admonitions Verified* by Cao Jinwei of Tanzhou. Its summary states:\n\nFormerly, Kou Qianzhi said: All who are born into the world under the baleful influence of inauspicious stars, destined for poverty and early death, owe this to the deep-rooted karmic offenses accumulated over past lives. They ought to renounce the household life, serve the Heavenly Emperor, and seek the power of blessings—only then may they escape poverty and early death. Thus did the practice of ritual burning and renunciation flourish.\n\nIn former times, there was one Xu Mi of Jingzhao, who from childhood suffered many illnesses. A diviner declared: “This child will not only be plagued by illness but is also fated for poverty and early death.” His parents did not yet believe it. When he reached eleven, a physiognomist said: “This child’s lifespan will not exceed fifteen years.” His parents, startled, asked: “Is there a way to avert this?” The physiognomist replied: “If you wish to escape calamity, there is no recourse but to leave the household life—only then may he barely survive.”\n\nThereupon, he was given to the Xuanyuan Abbey east of the city to become a Daoist. Mi diligently tended the incense and lamps morning and evening, sweeping the halls and corridors. Broom in hand, he did not shrink from labor in the winding cloisters; sickle and hoe in tow, he constantly exerted himself in the garden plots. At night, he recited scriptures and performed repentance rites, sat in meditation with focused intent, burned incense, and bowed in earnest devotion. Daily, he repaired walls and mended roofs, never idle for a moment. His hands and feet grew calloused and cracked like tortoise shells. Moreover, he did not consume the abbey’s provisions but prepared his own daily meals; he did not burn the abbey’s firewood but gathered his own and drew his own water for sustenance.\n\nSomeone, pitying his toil, asked: “Why do you endure so much hardship?” He replied: “For one who cultivates the Dao, the matter of life and death is grave—how can I rely on others to serve me while I do nothing myself? If others become my servants, I shall instead receive the blessings of heaven and humanity.”\n\nThus he persevered for over forty years. One day, he encountered a Daoist beneath the shade of a pine, who took his hand and said: “You have labored long. The Heavenly Emperor grants you longevity and bestows upon you rank. Soon, your name shall resound throughout the capital.” The court later appointed him Director of Daoist Affairs at Jingxiao Abbey, conferring upon him the title *Perfected One Who Assists the Dao and Transforms the World*. In the first year of Emperor Fei of the Southern Qi, during the reign of Yulin Wang, he reached the age of one hundred and one. The ruler of Northern Wei, hearing of this, dispatched envoys bearing gold and silk.\n\nAs his Dao neared completion, he met three Daoists who invited him to wander with them. He went, and during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Liang, there was one who abandoned Buddhism to study the Dao. Entering Mount Mao, he encountered Mi, who rode a great ram and said: “Go and tell the Daoist community of Xuanyuan Abbey in Jingzhao: I now serve as Left Minister of the Heavenly Canopy’s Inner Terrace in the Celestial Bureau.” From then on, his story spread throughout the world, and all who renounced the household life to serve the Dao came to know the value of diligence and reverence. Alas!\n\nWhen those who leave the household life first do so, it is often because their fate is afflicted by inauspicious stars, and their parents, fearing they cannot be raised, relinquish their six kin to entrust them to abbeys and temples. Later generations, unaware of cause and effect, have seen those who leave the household become mostly indolent, arrogant, and dissolute. They eat others’ food to sate their hunger, accept others’ reverence, seek others’ alms, yet feel no momentary shame. They pay no heed to whether incense burns in the halls, whether the steps and courtyards are clean, or whether the temple walls and roofs are crumbling. Idly they enjoy ease and pleasure, refusing to labor in devotion or reverence. Compared to the example of Xu Mi, how can this not weigh upon their hearts?\n\nMoreover, the laws of Heaven are stern, and the eyes of spirits see all. Though one may briefly enjoy warmth and fullness, one may yet fall into a lower existence! How could one advance toward the trials of Fengdu? From the age of eight, I left the household life, and now my hair has turned white. Often, as I face my meal, I reflect in silence, having done nothing to aid the teachings. I fear my transgressions run deep, and calamity may befall my nine generations. Thus, I universally admonish those who have left the household: all should awaken sharply, lest they sink into torpor. Perhaps then we may together ascend the ladder of immortality and uphold the Mysterious Principle.\n\nIn the second year of the Jianlong era of the Great Song, on the day following the full moon of the third month, Bai Jinwei, a Daoist of Shouxing Abbey in Tanzhou, Successor of the Orthodox Teaching of the Three Caverns, Subduer of Demons in the Qingwei Tradition, respectfully writes this.\n\n**Morning and Evening Observances**\nAll who dwell in jade halls and numinous abodes must prioritize the burning of incense and the performance of rites. The abbot of each abbey or temple shall daily gather the community to ascend the hall, burn incense, chant scriptures, pay homage to the Perfected, and offer veneration to the Sages. They should embody the heart of serving Heaven and upholding the teachings, thereby fulfilling their resolve to cultivate the Dao and refine their virtue.\n\n**New and Full Moons**\nOn the days of the new and full moons, bathe the day prior. At dawn on the appointed day, the abbot shall lead the community, clad in Daoist robes, to ascend the hall in proper order and chant scriptures—first to extend the Sage’s longevity, and second to propagate the Mysterious Model.\n\n**Festivals and Seasonal Observances**\nOn festival and seasonal days, perform the rites of homage to the Perfected. After the morning observances, revive the customs of antiquity by gathering in ritual feasts, strictly adhering to ancestral norms, and avoiding neglect or dissipation.\n\n**Opening and Closing the Abbey Gates**\nThe gates of abbeys and temples are of utmost importance and must be opened and closed at set times. At dawn, wait for light to open them; at dusk, close them while there is still light. The locks shall be managed by the designated officer, while the keys shall be kept by the common treasury. Opening and closing must follow the appointed times.\n\n**Morning Bells and Evening Drums**\nThe morning bell and evening drum summon the hundred spirits, enhance the majesty of abbeys and temples, and amplify the grandeur of mountains and mausoleums. They must not be omitted at dawn or dusk.\n\n**Morning Tea Assembly**\nAfter ascending the hall each day, Daoists and novices shall gather in the abbot’s quarters, arrange themselves in ranks, and bow before the abbot. Then, dividing into two ranks, the community shall bow to one another. Daoists shall sit in order, while novices shall bow toward the abbot, serve tea in turn, and stand respectfully below. The abbot shall address the day’s affairs. If there are public or private matters, official duties, or urgent business, they shall be reported to the abbot and discussed openly before the community. Once concluded, all shall bow and withdraw, upholding the pure regulations and not neglecting the Mysterious Teachings.\n\n**The Common Treasury**\nThe common treasury is the guiding principle of abbeys and temples. Those appointed to manage it must be persons of great virtue, magnanimity, impartiality, and integrity. All matters—such as the receipt and disbursement of money, grain, and cloth; the cultivation of fields, gardens, and mountain lands; and the reception of visiting officials—shall be assigned to various officers, who shall take turns overseeing them for one, two, or three years. They must act with fairness, devote themselves to the public good, and never favor private interests.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Yuchan said: “The common treasury’s wealth and grain are overseen by spirits; those who take from it shall each receive their karmic retribution.” These words are not empty—one must be vigilant and cautious.\n\n**Refectory and Banquets**\n\n**Attending Refectory Banquets**\n\nWhen attending banquets in the refectory, one must take one’s seat in proper order, strictly observing the rites of seniority and precedence—no disorder shall be permitted.\n\n**Daily Meals in the Refectory**\nEach person shall be allotted one *sheng* of rice per day from the common treasury. Vegetables, fish, and meat shall be provided according to abundance or scarcity. The three daily meals shall be announced by striking the cloud-shaped board, summoning the assembly to partake at the appointed times.\n\nWhen itinerant Daoist travelers arrive, they shall be provided meals for seven days in accordance with ancient custom. Those who remain through winter or summer to sit in meditation shall be furnished meals for one hundred days. Daoists serving in an official capacity at the abbey or temple shall receive rice on the same terms as resident Daoists and are not subject to these limitations.\n\nWhen eminent and virtuous masters from the capital or renowned sacred mountains visit the abbey or temple, they shall be received with doubled courtesy, their needs supplied without regard to duration.\n\n**Refectory Stores**\nDaily provisions shall follow established regulations. No private favors shall be granted, nor shall supplies be arbitrarily disbursed for personal use. Should vulgar and shameless individuals demand wine or food, those managing the common treasury must uphold the regulations with strict discipline. Violators shall be penalized by sponsoring a vegetarian feast at their own expense, to which the entire abbey must be invited.\n\n**Taking Disciples**\nIn accepting disciples, one must select the descendants of reputable families with long-standing virtue and renown in their communities—those who have cultivated the Dao and accumulated merit. They must be free of debilitating illnesses or impediments. Only those received with proper rites and bound as Daoist kin may be admitted.\n\nThe descendants of indolent or worldly artisans, as well as those afflicted with foul odors, blindness, facial scars, polydactyly, lameness, or other disabilities, shall not be taken as disciples.\n\n**Issuing Ordination Certificates**\nWhen Daoist novices enter the Mystic Gate in childhood and study the scriptures of their tradition, those who mature into individuals of true Daoist capacity may, upon reaching the appropriate year for ordination, submit a petition to the Daoist Registry in advance to ensure a smooth process. Thus, the transmission shall endure from generation to generation without interruption.\n\n**Ritual Offerings**\nWhen patrons bring incense to the abbey or temple to sponsor ritual offerings, the common treasury shall assign responsible Daoists to oversee all related matters. They must perform their duties with reverence, adhering to the rites of celestial worship, and never betray the patron’s trust.\n\n**Soliciting Alms**\nWhen abbeys or temples undertake renovations, they must rely on the generosity of benefactors. The common treasury shall appoint capable individuals to carry petitions and solicit funds and grain to support the construction.\n\nFirst, they should seek out wealthy and virtuous households in distant regions known for their benevolence. If such families are genuinely inclined to donate, they shall be respectfully approached. Those who, despite their wealth, remain miserly and unwilling to give shall be passed by. Donations of any amount, whether large or small, shall be gratefully received.\n\n**Renovations and Repairs**\nMaintenance must never be neglected. Several individuals shall be appointed to conduct regular inspections. Halls, walls, ditches, and pathways—anything damaged shall be repaired immediately. Bricks, tiles, bamboo, timber, nails, iron, and lime shall all be requisitioned from the common treasury. Funds and grain solicited for this purpose shall be prepared in advance, stored in the upper treasury, and reserved for renovations.\n\n**Sweeping and Cleaning**\nBefore sweeping any hall, water must first be sprinkled to settle the dust. After a brief interval, a broom shall be used to gather dust into piles at intervals of five *chi*, ensuring it is not scattered haphazardly. Otherwise, dust may rise and obscure sacred images, banners, and floral decorations—this must be strictly avoided.\n\n**Grain Management**\nFor abbeys or temples with grain stores, the accounting shall be handled by the grain office. Whether through exchange, transport, or retention, all decisions must be made in advance to avoid missing delivery deadlines. Trustworthy individuals shall be appointed to oversee transport to the granary, ensuring timely completion to avoid urgent demands.\n\n**Managing Distant Farmlands**\nFor farmlands located far from the abbey or temple, granaries and storage sheds shall be established to store grain, agricultural tools, and other necessities. Only honest and reliable locals shall be employed as caretakers. Outsiders without proper ties must not be allowed to reside there, lest theft or pilfering occur over time, leading to unforeseen troubles. Careful consideration must be given beforehand to avoid future regrets.\n\n**Collecting Rent**\nFor abbeys or temples with extensive farmlands, landless peasants shall be recruited as tenants. Agreements must be made in advance, specifying the amount of pure grain rent to be paid. At harvest time, overseers shall be dispatched to the fields to supervise the reaping, threshing, and storage, ensuring the rent is collected in full and on time. Tenants shall be prohibited from privately harvesting the crops, thus preventing any shortfall in rent.\n\n**Lending Grain**\nWhen the common treasury has surplus grain, it may be lent to upright and respectable villagers for their sustenance. At harvest time, the principal along with interest shall be collected as per the agreement. This is not for the treasury’s profit but to assist the local populace in times of need.\n\n**Granaries and Storehouses**\nGranaries and storehouses, where the common treasury’s supplies are stored, must be separate from living quarters and not directly connected to avoid the risk of fire. Those in charge must be strict and vigilant.\n\n**Gardens and Vegetable Plots**\nDaily vegetables must never be lacking; they should be cultivated diligently. All varieties may be eaten, except for the five pungent vegetables—onion, garlic, leek, *xie*, and *wei*—which Daoist practitioners must not consume. As the *Erya* states: “Those who observe fasts and abstain from the five pungent vegetables refer to these five,” not to fish or meat. Daoists observing fasts must take note.\n\n**Requesting Leave**\nWhen visiting family, calling on friends, or traveling afar, one must request leave. The destination must be verified to ensure no impediments exist before permission is granted. No false pretenses shall be tolerated, nor shall others be brought along, lest disputes arise and the reputation of the Daoist community be tarnished. All must exercise caution.\n\n**Cloud Wandering**\nDaoists who travel to seek the truth and inquire into the Dao are called *cloud wanderers*. Daoists are servants of Heaven, and those who align with Heaven naturally ascend—hence the term *cloud wandering*. Such wanderers must be skilled in praying for clear skies or rain, dispelling evil and banishing demons, alleviating disasters and rescuing those in distress. They should also be versed in geomancy, physiognomy, astrology, divination, poetry, calligraphy, and painting before setting forth.\n\nOtherwise, they are but common and vulgar individuals, unworthy of consideration.\n\n**Recommendations**\nAll heads and officers of abodes and temples must select those of virtue and Daoist attainment to oversee their affairs. The unworthy shall not be protected by personal favor, nor shall the virtuous be envied out of private resentment. All must act with impartiality to command the respect of the community.\n\n**Appointment to Office**\nRegardless of whether they come from afar or nearby, those of Daoist attainment and capable of managing affairs shall be invited with propriety into abodes and temples to assume office.\n\n**The Abbot**\nShould the chief of an abode or temple commit transgressions, the community shall admonish them thrice. If they fail to reform, they shall step down to make way for one of virtue to succeed them.\n\n**Disciplinary Measures for Daoists in Violation**\nAll violations shall be addressed by the community. For minor offenses, the wrongdoer shall be admonished face-to-face and urged to reform and cultivate goodness. For offenses beyond the bounds of the law, the *Pure Regulations* shall be applied, and their transgressions recorded in the register. After three recorded offenses, the offender shall be seated at the lowest rank during assemblies and barred from ascending the altar during grand jiao rites. For those whose evil is grave and intolerable, making cohabitation in the abode or temple impossible, the community shall expel them. After their expulsion, a broom shall sweep their traces from the ground, severing all ties to prevent their return.\n\n**Established Disciplinary Methods**\nSince ancient times, abodes and temples have maintained disciplinary methods through established regulations. The system of discipline is as follows: for offenses comparable to those punishable by flogging or caning under common law, the penalty shall be halved. For instance, if a commoner’s offense warrants forty strokes, the Daoist *Pure Regulations* impose only twenty, allowing the offender to correct their ways and reflect. For other offenses, the severity shall be measured against the law, and penalties determined accordingly—this is the method of discipline and admonition in the Daoist tradition. However, if an offense is brought before the authorities, the penalty for a Daoist shall be one degree harsher than that for a commoner. Why? Because those who cultivate the Dao are duty-bound to accumulate merit, humble their bodies, and endure shame. To commit an offense is to reveal a lack of true cultivation. Dwelling in grand halls, eating without labor, and enjoying the blessings of heaven and humanity—how can their punishment not be one degree harsher than that of commoners? How can they not be held in awe?\n\n**Design of the Pure Regulations Discipline Ruler**\nConstructed of wood, it shall be one *cun* and four *fen* in width, four *fen* in thickness, and three *chi* in length.\n**Front:**\n**Back:**\n\nIn violation of the law—*Edict on Disputes and Admonitions* issued in the second year of Qianfeng under Emperor Gaozong of Tang:\n\nWe, having received the Mandate of Heaven and ruling over all under heaven, dare not but revere and exalt the Dao of Heaven to manifest Heaven’s virtue. Recently, Yang Taixuan, the Libationer of Haotian Abbey, and the monk Zongjing of Huayan Monastery have disputed over precedence, and though We have already admonished them, they still refuse to comply. We have examined the ancient canons and commanded scholars to assess their relative merits. Upon careful consideration of the precedence between Dao and Buddhism, and the weight accorded to Chinese and foreign teachings, We have weighed present circumstances against ancient principles, tracing reason to its source.\n\nFrom the perspective of Heaven and humanity: the Dao is the mother of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, while the Buddha attained enlightenment through cultivation of the Dao. The Dao is named after Heaven, whereas the Buddha is ranked among humans—who would dare place a human above Heaven and Earth?\n\nFrom the perspective of Chinese and foreign: the Daoist teaching was inaugurated by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi of Our Middle Kingdom, while Buddhism originated with the foreigner of Kapilavastu in the Western Regions. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi are the great sages of China, whereas the Buddha is but a virtuous man of the Western barbarians. Judged by the distinction between Chinese and foreign, how can an external teaching be placed above that of Our Middle Kingdom?\n\nFrom the perspective of temporal precedence: the Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, while Buddhism arose later and flourished afterward. The Dao began before Pangu, whereas the Buddha was born in the reign of King Zhuang of Zhou. Between them lie over three million seven thousand years—who would dare place the era of King Zhuang before that of Pangu?\n\nFrom the perspective of dynasties: the Dao was expounded in the age of the Yellow Emperor, while Buddhism emerged in the time of Emperor Ming of Han. The Dao preceded the Dragon and Horse, whereas Buddhism arrived at the end of the Metal Rabbit. How can one dare to exalt the Later Han and belittle the Yellow Emperor?\n\nMoreover, according to the old customs of the monastic community, precedence is determined by seniority: even a young monk who enters the temple first must be ranked above an elder who enters later. This is an unchanging principle of monastic discipline, a natural order of Heaven and Earth. Since the Dao precedes Buddhism, what doubt can there be?\n\nHenceforth, after this proclamation, both teachings shall abide by Our decree. Should any dare to disobey and persist in disputation, the gravest offenders shall be punished with the utmost severity, while lesser ones shall be sentenced to hard labor as *chengdan* and *zhong*. Let all officials enforce Our judgment.\n\n*Edict on Prohibiting Cliques and Evil* issued in the first year of Hongdao under Our humble virtue, We have inherited the grand enterprise and recognized that the failure to clarify teachings leads to abuses that endure for ten thousand generations. To know of abuses and not reform them is to share equal culpability. We have broadly sought the details of public opinion and established measures to uphold the great principles.\n\nIn the age of the Yellow Emperor, the transmission of the Daoist lineage was already established. By the end of the Han, the teachings of Buddhism first appeared. Their original purpose was to transform the violent into the benevolent and guide the wicked toward goodness. Yet how did matters come to this?\n\nIn the first year of Zhongping under Emperor Ling of Han, Zhang Jiao of Julu initially used talismanic water to treat illnesses, relieving suffering wherever he went—his methods were indeed effective and commendable. Within a year, people from all directions flocked to him. Zhang Jiao then became arrogant, coveting the imperial throne. He incited rebellion, styling himself the Grand Worthy Teacher and Heavenly General, while his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were named Earthly General and Human General, respectively. They amassed over a thousand followers, all wearing yellow turbans as their insignia, and threw the realm into chaos. The very foundation of the Han nearly collapsed. After their defeat and capture, Zhang Jiao and his clique were executed.\n\nAmong the abuses of the Buddhist clergy: during the Tianjian era of the Liang, the monk Faqing and his disciple Li Guibo rebelled, with Faqing declaring himself the Emperor of the Great Vehicle and Li Guibo the Ten Abodes Bodhisattva, the Pacifier of Demons, and King of Han. Their warfare raged across thousands of *li*, with weapons blanketing the fields and conflict persisting for years. The people suffered as if scorched by fire, and the state teetered on the brink of collapse, nearly bringing ruin to the nation.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Taiwu of Wei, the Buddhist devotee Gai Wu and the monks of Chang’an Monastery usurped the title of emperor and rebelled. Upon discovery, they were executed.\n\nIn the Daye era of the Sui, dozens of bandits styled themselves as Maitreya Buddha, donning *kunlu* hats, burning incense, and carrying flowers. They stormed the Jianguomen Gate, seized weapons from the palace guards, and suddenly erupted into rebellion. As soldiers clashed in the palace courtyards, blood flowed upon the steps, nearly precipitating a great disaster—how terrifying!\n\nIn the first year of Wude under Our High Ancestor, the monk Gao Tansheng and five thousand fellow monks rebelled, declaring himself the Emperor of the Great Vehicle. The nun Zheng Xuan was named his Empress Yeshu, and he changed the era name to *Falun*. They attacked prefectures and counties, slaughtering officials and soldiers.\n\nMore recently, the monk Zhi Jue married the daughter of the Tao family to fulfill the \"peach and plum repentance,\" colluding with the Khitans to proclaim himself emperor. Another Buddhist devotee, Tie Yu, incited rebellion, declaring the advent of the Holy Buddha and styling himself the Radiant Great Sage Emperor. They killed government troops and burned civilian homes.\n\nFrom these examples, it is clear that the two teachings have brought no small calamity to the realm. We have examined the ancient records from the dawn of time to the present—spanning hundreds of thousands of years—and found that the Dao has committed but one offense, and its harm was minor. From the time of Emperor Ming of Han to the present, less than a thousand years have passed, yet the harms of Buddhism have been numerous and their rebellions severe.\n\nWe aspire to revive the customs of high antiquity and restore the governance of Fuxi and Shennong. Let the people of China follow the teachings of China, and the barbarians follow the teachings of the barbarians. We wish to sever the traces of foreign influence in China to prevent future disasters, to distinguish between the orthodox and the heterodox in the Dao, and to maintain the distinction between Chinese and foreign. How can one, with the heart of a sage, practice the teachings of foreign barbarians? How can We indulge them with leniency and refrain from abolishing them?\n\nHenceforth, the quotas for Daoist and Buddhist clergy shall be fixed. Should any dare to privately recruit disciples, harbor fugitives, deceive the good, or form cliques to imitate one another, they shall be seized by the people and delivered to the judicial authorities for investigation. If any act against the law, their entire clan shall be executed without mercy. Thus, this edict.\n\n**Court Audience Ritual**\n\nFor all court assemblies, the Celestial Master shall don the ritual vestments, wear the *fuyang* cap, and hold the inscribed tablet with tassels, as though standing before the Supreme Emperor. All Daoists, regardless of age or rank, shall wear robes of golden hem and the *Zhengyi* cap, holding inscribed tablets. On ordinary days when appearing before the emperor, they shall not hold tablets but wear plain robes, without distinction between Quanzhen and other traditions, their hemp sleeves as usual.\n\nConsider the example of Buddhist monks: regardless of age, rank, or status, all don golden-hemmed robes and cassocks. How then can Daoists, when entering court to see the sovereign, fail to observe proper ritual?\n\nSince the Han dynasty, the greatest taboo has been the *leijin* headwrap and short jacket. The short jacket is the garb of the vulgar masses; the *leijin*, the headwrap of rustics. Recluses in the mountains use it to cover their unkempt hair. Those who cultivate the Great Way preserve spirit and gather *qi*, uniting the Three Flowers at the *niwan* to guard against its opening, lest wind and evil assail it. How can one wear a *leijin* to court? Such conduct is deemed irreverent.\n\nTo leave the household is named for the hairpin and cap. To forgo the hairpin and cap in favor of a *leijin*—is this proper? Only the shallow and ostentatious would do so; those of pure virtue would never abandon the ritual of hairpin and cap. Formerly, Duke Zhuang of Zheng killed his son Zang because his cap was askew. Thus did Confucius begin the *Spring and Autumn Annals* with this account. All who belong to the Daoist tradition must take heed.\n\nSee also the chapter on \"Regulations for Robes and Ritual Attire.\"\n\nAccording to a directive issued by the Central Secretariat in the fourth year of Zhongtong (1263) to all circuit branch secretariats: Since the collapse of the Song and the chaos that engulfed the realm, ritual and law have yet to be fully restored, and those who remain obstinate in their ways are none other than Buddhist monks and Daoists. Upon examination, monks take tonsure as their practice, while Daoists leave the household by wearing the hairpin and cap. Yet today, when monks meet their superiors or teachers upon entering a temple, they remove their hats, but when entering the palace gate, they do not remove them—only before the sovereign do they doff their hats. Is this proper ritual?\n\nMoreover, since ancient times, Buddhist and Daoist officials have had no precedent for wearing caps and sashes; their office is marked solely by tonsure or the hairpin and cap. Even the Three Dukes and Six Ministers remove their caps and kowtow before the sovereign. Those who have left the household to cultivate the Way take humility as their foremost virtue and modesty as their power. How can they refuse to remove their hats, acting with arrogance and self-importance?\n\nHenceforth, any monk or Daoist who fails to remove their hat when meeting an official shall receive seventeen strokes of the cane and be returned to lay life. Those who fail to remove their hats when entering court shall receive seventy strokes and be exiled to Tubo. As for attire:\n\nDaoists shall not wear Mongol-style sleeveless jackets but shall don the caps and robes of the Yellow Emperor’s lineage. Monks shall not adopt Tang-style dress, nor wear the lascivious robes of Empress Wu or the *kunlu* hat. Ordained monks shall wear the red woolen robes of the Western Regions; Chan monks shall wear the black cloth robes of Emperor Wu of Liang, and shall not don garments of silk, damask, gauze, or brocade.\n\nNuns shall be permitted only the attire of female Daoists. Neither lay nor ordained women shall be allowed to live in communal cloisters. Those who conceal male monks, blurring distinctions between male and female, and thus spread licentiousness—leading to the discovery of infant corpses and skeletal remains piled in rear gardens—have been numerous. Such depravity corrupts public morals and must be strictly prohibited. Those who dare persist in such violations shall be executed.\n\n1. **Morning and Evening Hall Services**\n   The bell and drum shall be sounded for morning and evening assemblies. The morning service shall begin at first light, the evening service after sunset. Daoists shall first strike the assembly drum to gather the community, then burn incense and recite scriptures once through. After two bows, they shall withdraw. Those who fail to attend shall be fined five *jin* of oil, equivalent to fifty prostrations. Those who spread dissent or refuse to comply shall be fined ten *jin* of oil, equivalent to one hundred prostrations. Those who persist in defiance shall be flogged forty times before the assembly, barred from communal meals and lodging, and their rations withheld for one year.\n\n2. **Discipline for Daoists**\n   For minor transgressions, Daoists shall be penalized with offerings of incense or lamps. For graver offenses, they shall be flogged. If they persist after flogging, they shall be assigned to kitchen duties or labor in the gardens. If they transgress again, they shall be reduced to latrine attendants, tasked with cutting rods for latrine use, for a term of one or two years, until they reform.\n\n3. **Expulsion for Grave Offenses**\n   For Daoists guilty of repeated or severe misconduct—such as refusing instruction, violating monastic rules, theft, harm, or violent and unbenevolent acts—the gravest penalty shall be permanent expulsion from their home abbey. Their offenses shall be recorded in the abbey’s registry for posterity.\n\n4. **Welcoming Wandering Daoists**\n   When wandering Daoists, drawn by the excellence of mountains and rivers or the numinosity of blessed lands, seek to cultivate the Dao at an abbey, their needs shall be provided for equally with resident Daoists. No distinctions shall be made. Those who spread slander, defame others, or stir up discord shall receive twenty strokes of the cane and be demoted to work as estate laborers, barred from entering the abbey.\n\n5. **Hospitality to Itinerant Daoists**\n   When wandering Daoists arrive at an abbey, they shall be hosted for ten days, with all necessities provided without fail. If they wish to stay through winter or summer, they may do so. If they choose to remain indefinitely, they may also do so. Those of true ability...\n\nIf they possess true abilities, they may be permitted to take on duties. When assigning roles, those lacking in pure virtue or prone to rash temper shall not be allowed, lest they provoke misfortune.\n\n**Receiving Itinerant Monks**\nWhen wandering Buddhist monks arrive at an abbey and wish to stay temporarily, observe the summer retreat, or pass the winter, their food and lodging shall be provided without fail from the abbey’s stores. However, their ordination certificates must first be examined to verify their authenticity before they are permitted to stay.\n\n**Register of Wandering Daoists**\nEvery abbey shall keep a register titled *Record of Wandering Daoists*. When Daoists from afar arrive, the abbey’s superintendent shall inspect their ordination certificates and record in the register: “Daoist [Name], from [Prefecture] [Location], arrived on [Year] [Month] [Day].” When they depart, the date of their departure shall also be recorded, lest fugitives conceal their identities and burden the abbey. If they lack ordination certificates but possess official documents, these shall likewise be examined. They may not be allowed to stay long, but their details must still be recorded in the register, lest the abbey be implicated in harboring fugitives. This record shall serve as reference for verification.\n\n*This concludes the first fascicle of* The Jade Register of the Supreme Dao of the Celestial August, *section on “Abbey Halls and Sacred Altars.”*\n\nThe term *gong* (宫) refers to the palatial residences where emperors and kings reside, known as *gong*. The Yellow Emperor offered sacrifices to the Supreme Deity at the *Haotian Gong* (Palace of the Vast Heaven) and to the Three Pure Ones at the *Taiji Tiangong* (Palace of the Great Ultimate Heaven). Thus, when the Yellow Emperor received the Mandate of Heaven, all subsequent rulers who governed the realm were said to \"serve Heaven and uphold the celestial mandate\"—this marks the origin of *gong*.\n\nThe term *guan* (观) combines *xia yang shang* (下仰上, \"gazing upward from below\") and *yin guan xia* (音贯, \"overseeing from above\"). It denotes the halls where emperors administered governance, such as the *Mingtang* (Hall of Illumination), embodying the principle of \"residing on high to oversee below\"—hence the term *guan*. According to the *Inner Biography of the Yellow Emperor*, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon the Emperor the Primordial True Form of the White Jade Yuan Shi, which was placed atop a lofty *guan*—this marks the origin of *guan*.\n\nThe term *dian* (殿) is explained in the *Yanyi*: \"Dian means *fa* (法, 'model' or 'standard').\" It signifies the central structure among clustered halls, resolving doubts as noted by Zhi Yu. The *Yaozhu* states: \"A *dian* has steps and a raised platform, while a *tang* (堂) has steps but no platform.\" The *Spring and Autumn Annals* refers to it as *luzin* (路寝), and both the *Book of Rites* and *Baihu Tong* call it \"the hall of the Son of Heaven.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* notes that Qin Shi Huang constructed the *Chaogong* (朝宫) south of the Wei River, beginning with the *Qiandian* (前殿) and *Efang* (阿房). The *Book of Lord Shang* also mentions \"the *dian* of the Son of Heaven,\" indicating that this designation existed as early as the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin. The Qin dynasty, like the sun, had its *dian*. Later generations, when worshipping the Celestial Emperor, established halls such as the *Jinque Liaoyang Baodian* (Golden Watchtower of the Luminous Yang Treasure Hall), *Wuji Baodian* (Infinite Treasure Hall), and *Taiji Dian* (Hall of the Great Ultimate), with countless names—this marks the origin of *dian*.\n\nThe term *ge* (阁) is mentioned in the *Han Shi Waizhuan*: \"During the time of the Yellow Emperor, the phoenix nested in the *A Ge* (阿阁).\" Thus, *ge* also originated with the Yellow Emperor. Later generations built halls to worship the Celestial Emperor, constructing *ge* such as the *Tongming Ge* (Hall of Universal Illumination), *Zixu Ge* (Purple Void Hall), and *Yuhuang Ge* (Jade Emperor Hall)—this marks the origin of *ge*. I myself have built the *Shouxing Ge* (Hall of the Star of Longevity) and *Tianhuang Ge* (Celestial August Hall) at the *Changsheng Gong* (Palace of Longevity) to pray for the people’s well-being and bountiful harvests.\n\nThe term *lou* (楼) is recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*, where fangshi (方士) told Emperor Wu of Han: \"The Yellow Emperor constructed the Five Cities and Twelve Towers to await divine beings.\" The Emperor then ascended the *Ganlou* (干楼). Thus, *lou* likely originated in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Later generations, when worshipping the Celestial Emperor, built many *lou* in abbeys and halls, such as the *Zhonggu Lou* (Bell and Drum Tower) and *Qizhen Lou* (Tower of Perfected Immortals)—this marks the origin of *lou*.\n\nThe *Daozang* (道藏, Daoist Canon) began when Laozi served as the *Shoucang Shi* (Keeper of the Archives) for King Wen of Zhou, storing books in the Eastern *Guan*. Later Daoist traditions all maintained *Daozang* collections of scriptures. Master Lupi constructed a rotating wheel suspended in a *ge*, which would sound bells and drums when moved. Inside, it housed scriptures, while the exterior was carved with images of celestial deities—this marks its origin. Later generations established repositories such as the *Yunzhang Baoshi* (Cloud Seal Treasure Chamber) and *Tianzhang Baocang* (Celestial Seal Treasure Repository), as well as the *Feitian Falun* (Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel)—this marks the origin of *zang* (藏). I have renamed the *Zang Dian* (Repository Hall) as the *Zongji Dian* (Hall of the Turning Mechanism), signifying its operation of the celestial Dao, like the *Xuanji* (璇玑) and *Yuheng* (玉衡), to align with the heavens.\n\nThe term *tang* (堂) refers to the *Yanfa Tang* (Hall of Dharma Exposition) built by Daoist priests (*yuliu*) for celestial *jiao* (醮, ritual offerings). The hall was arranged with six curtains, within which the six masters were seated to preside over the ritual—this marks the origin of *tang*. I have renamed it the *Taixuan Dian* (Hall of the Great Mystery).\n\nThe term *Tianguan* (天关, Celestial Gate) originates with me. I established the *Yuchen Tianguan* (Jade August Celestial Gate) at the *Nanji Changsheng Gong* (Southern Culmen Palace of Longevity), with the Four Celestial August Lords arrayed on either side: the first, *Chengtian Fuxiao Qingling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Azure Numen, Assistant to Heaven and Teacher of the Dao); the second, *Anbang Zhuguo Haoling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Radiant Numen, Pillar of the State and Protector of the Realm); the third, *Baozhen Guozuo Danling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Cinnabar Numen, Guardian of the State and Stabilizer of the Mandate); and the fourth, *Zhiyu Wanshen Xuanling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Mysterious Numen, Controller of the Myriad Spirits). Before the gate, two couplets are inscribed:\n*\"The celestial gates swing open, as immortals from the Three Realms come to pay homage to Heaven;*\n*The vault of heaven clears, as the Four Numinous Lords stand in attendance.\"*\n\nThe term *Tianmen* (天门, Gate of Heaven) is recorded in the *Huangtu Yaoji*: \"The Yellow Emperor created doors and windows.\" Thus, the construction of doors and windows followed the establishment of roofs and eaves, serving to open and close at dawn and dusk to ward off violence—hence the term *men* (门). Ancient designs featured pairs of Dragon and Tiger Lords or Celestial Ding (天丁). In my own designs, any gate with Celestial Ding or Dragon and Tiger Lords is called *Tianguan*, while those without are called *Tianmen*, as they serve as the place to worship the Supreme Deity and the Two Pure Ones, situated within the realm of the *Tailuo Yuqing* (太罗玉清, Great Net of Jade Purity). Thus, they are named *Tianmen*. The unenlightened common folk mistakenly call them *Shanmen* (山门, Mountain Gate) or *Sanmen* (三门, Triple Gate), which strays far from the Dao.\n\nThe *Boting* (钵堂, Alms Bowl Hall) is where Daoist companions (*luánchóu hèlǚ*) from the four directions gather to lodge. Since ancient times, it has existed in sacred mountains and immortal sites. I constructed a *Boting* at the *Nanji Changsheng Gong*, naming it the *Bingzhen Guan* (Hall of Perfected Immortals’ Lodging). Its name is inscribed on the lintel, with a couplet:\n*\"All cloud-roaming and water-wandering immortals dwell here;*\n*The foremost of the Perfected in the world reside within this first gate.\"*\n\nAbove the front veranda hangs a plaque reading *\"Hualing Yinai\"* (华灵隐霭, \"Misty Veil of the Flourishing Numen\"). The veranda’s pillars bear couplets:\n*\"Expounding the great Dao of the sages of China;*\n*Inheriting the legacy of the immortals of the heavens above.\"*\n\nIn the center of the veranda stands a plaque for opening and closing the gate. Within, an image of Perfected Wang Chongyang is enshrined, with a table displaying the Five Phases (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) to harmonize their transformations. Seven golden lotuses are arranged in front to symbolize the profound mystery of the Seven Perfected. A *Bojia* (钵架, alms bowl stand) is placed in the center, with a water cauldron below and five bells and one alms bowl suspended above. The stand bears a couplet:\n*\"When the five bells chime in unison, the gate of the Great Ultimate swings wide;*\n*When the single bowl briefly rests, one re-enters the chamber of the Great Mystery.\"*\n\nOn either side, fourteen seats are arranged in pairs, each designated by the cyclical signs *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, si, wu, wei, shen, you, xu,* and *hai*. The hall’s pillars display couplets:\n*\"Silently paying homage to the Supreme Deity, ascending to the Golden Watchtower;*\n*Quietly guarding the Central Yellow, sealing the Jade Gate.\"*\n\nThere are two side chambers: the left is called *Hechao* (鹤巢, Crane’s Nest), and the right is called *Linsou* (麟薮, Unicorn’s Marsh).\n\nWithin are fourteen cloud beds, fully furnished with all necessities for daily practice—robes, ritual implements, and utensils for vegetarian meals—prepared to accommodate itinerant Daoist adepts. Those who establish alms halls should take this as their model.\n\n**Enclosed Chamber (圓室)**\nConstructed of brick, the chamber measures one *zhang* in diameter, with no door, only a small aperture for passing food. At the rear, a hole is left for waste disposal. When a Daoist enters, the opening is sealed with bricks—this is called *closing the pass*. After a hundred days of seclusion, the seal is removed—this is called *opening the pass*. Such is the design of the enclosed chamber.\n\nZhang Daoling, a descendant of Han Dynasty Marquis of Liu (Zhang Liang) from Pei’s Fengyi district, was originally a scholar of the Imperial Academy. Having passed the examinations for *Xianliang Fangzheng* (Worthy and Upright) and *Zhiyan Jijian* (Candid Remonstrance), he later lamented, *\"This does nothing to prolong life.\"* He then pursued the Dao of longevity, mastering the *Nine Cauldrons Elixir Method* of the Yellow Emperor. Entering Mount Heming in Shu, he sat in the enclosed chamber, refining his will and composing twenty-four scrolls of Daoist scripture. After three years, his elixir complete, he told his disciple Wang Chang: *\"The divine elixir, when consumed, must ascend to heaven. Yet I must first benefit the nation and relieve the people’s suffering, serving the Three Realms—only then will I be without shame.\"* The Emperor, hearing of his virtue, appointed him Grand Tutor and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Jixian. On the ninth day of the ninth month in the first year of *Yongshou* (155 CE), he ascended to heaven with his wife, Lady Yong. The enclosed chamber originated with him.\n\n**Hermitage (庵)**\nKuang Xu, a descendant of the Xia Emperor Yu, had five brothers, all born with divine intelligence. The eldest was named Xu Zhou. During King Wu’s reign, he and Laozi served together as *Zhuxia* historians, receiving Laozi’s teachings. He later withdrew to Xunyang, where three brothers built huts on Tianchi Peak, and two on Tiger Creek. Upon achieving transcendence, the mountain was named *Kuanglu* (Mount Lu). Emperor Wu of Han enfeoffed him as *Daming Jun* (Lord of Great Brilliance). The present dynasty later changed *Jun* to *Gong* (Duke). Thus began the hermitage.\n\nLater, reclusive scholars and those who attained the Dao built thatched huts among cliffs and ravines, following this tradition. I, too, have emulated this design, constructing a thatched hut on the southern peak of Mount Xialing. The land produces *lingzhi* mushrooms, so I named it *Zhi An* (Mushroom Hermitage). Its couplet reads:\n*\"I dwell beyond the world, apart from the vulgar;*\n*Who believes this hut holds another heaven?\"*\n\nInside the hermitage, another couplet hangs:\n*\"A room no larger than a bushel, yet the heart spans the heavens;*\n*In silent sitting, spirit congeals—profound thoughts touch the mysterious workings.\"*\n\nBelow the hermitage stands the *White Cloud Elixir Chamber*. Its couplet declares:\n*\"Grasping white clouds to refine the Great Return;*\n*Fleeing the red dust to become a minor recluse—*\n*awaiting one of the Dao to dwell here.\"*\n\nThe path begins south of the *Feisheng* (Ascension) Terrace, west of Ling Peak, winding through a grove of pines and cedars. Upon arrival, a plaque reads: *\"Deep Within the White Clouds.\"* Its couplet proclaims:\n*\"A gourd contains a small heaven and earth;\"*\n\nAmidst boundless wild clouds, depths unknown.\n\nAs one nears the hermitage, a plaque along the path reads: *\"Where Red Dust Never Reaches.\"* Its couplet proclaims:\n*\"In stillness, sun and moon stretch long;*\n*In leisure, heaven and earth expand wide.\"*\n\n**Terrace**\nIn ancient times, those who cultivated the Dao and achieved perfection, fully attaining ascension, would conceal themselves in sacred mountains and immortal lands before ascending. Thus, I have established the *Feisheng* (Ascension) Terrace atop the *Xialing* Grotto-Heaven’s *Xialing* Peak, awaiting those who attain the Dao and join the ranks of immortals—surely they shall mount this terrace to ascend. Upon the terrace’s ancient pillars hangs this couplet:\n*\"Ninefold elixir perfected, one step soars to the Purple Ultimate;*\n*Great Return refined, the body leaps straight to the Azure Heavens.\"*\n\n**Temple**\nThe term *temple* denotes the rank of the Six Ministers, the station of a court official, where the *dafu* (grand master) resides. Thus, the Qin established the *Taichang* Temple to preside over the rites of heaven’s worship. Emperor Wu of Han appointed the Daoist Ling Taichong as *Taichang* Minister, renaming the *Taichang* Temple as *Chengtian* Temple to venerate the Supreme Emperor. From then on, Daoist priests served as *Taichang* officials to oversee sacrificial rites. Additionally, a *jijiu* (libationer) was appointed to manage *jiao* (offering) affairs, and the *Chengtian* Temple became the official residence of Daoist priests.\n\n**Shrine**\nThe shrines of Daoist ancient sages began with the shrine of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign on Mount Emei. Of old, there were the Three Mountain Shrines. On Mount Emei in Shu, the palace of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once stood. At Tianchi and Huxi of Mount Lu in Xunyang, the two shrines of the Great Illuminated Lords were located. On the Five Terraces Mountain of Jin, there were two shrines: one was the palace of the Purple Mansion’s Gate Lord, and the other was the palace where Wang Zijin’s younger brother, Meishou, cultivated the Dao. Each of the Three Mountains possessed luminous stones that, when struck by sunlight amidst white clouds, emitted rays of five colors. After the Five Barbarians’ chaos in the Central Plains, these lands were thrown into turmoil. Because of their radiance, the stones were seized by Shi Le and Yao Chang to build barbarian temples, and thus the Three Mountain shrines of China’s divine beings were extinguished.\n\n**Abode**\nThe Heavenly Perfected had the *Xuanguan* (Mystic Lodge).\n\nThe residences of those who cultivate the Dao are called *Xuanguan* (Mystic Lodges).\n\n**Courtyards**\nThe dwellings where Daoist communities gather are called *yuan* (courtyards).\n\n**Heavenly Palace**\nThe chamber where the Crown Prince of King Mu of Zhou revered the Heavenly Venerable Supreme Lord was named the Heavenly Palace. From the Han and Jin dynasties onward, all households that revered the Dao established chambers for the Heavenly Venerable Supreme Lord, all called Heavenly Palaces.\n\n**Thunder Altar**\nThe chambers where those practicing Thunder Rites and offering prayers revered the Thunder Deity are called Thunder Altars.\n\n**Altars and Sacred Grounds**\nFang’s commentary states: \"Sacrifices to the earth are performed on *shan* (sacred grounds), while those to heaven are conducted on *tan* (altars).\" The *Book of Documents* records that when King Wu fell ill, the Duke of Zhou constructed three altars on a shared sacred ground. The *Inner Transmission of the Yellow Emperor* records the earliest instance of constructing altars and sacred grounds.\n\n**Imperial Altar**\nThe liturgical texts state: \"Solemnity, reverence, and secrecy pertain to the inner truth of harmonizing and merging with the perfected; the waving of banners, standards, and pennants, with their measured movements, pertain to the external rites. Yet when sincerity unites with the real, and application is unquestioned, one becomes a companion to heaven and earth. Even so, external rites are still required to transform the realm. Every bow and rise, every advance and retreat, all that the eyes see and ears hear—none is not a proper matter. With no opening for wayward thoughts to enter, one may communicate with the Heavenly Perfected and reach the Supreme Lord. Thus, modeling heaven, emulating earth, and reflecting the majesty of the world, one ensures that reverence prevails in all directions.\"\n\nAll altars and sacred grounds are constructed in three tiers, reflecting the distinction between the exalted heaven and the humble earth.\n\nThe upper tier is established as the Heavenly Treasure Flower Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Vacuous August, where the Three Treasures and Imperial Masters are enshrined. To the left, the banner of the Heavenly Perfected and Life-Demolishing Deity is erected; to the right, the standard of the Lion and Evil-Repelling Deity is raised. On the far left, talismans for communicating with the perfected are placed to summon a thousand truths; on the far right, talismans for reaching the numinous are set to invoke ten thousand spirits. In the center, talismans of the Three Mornings are arranged to circulate the myriad *qi* and dispel malevolent vapors.\n\nTo the east of the altar, the Azure Dragon banner is planted; to the west, the White Tiger banner talisman; to the south, the Vermilion Bird banner talisman; and to the north, the Dark Warrior banner talisman. In the five directions, stabilizing jade talismans are also laid. This constitutes the upper tier.\n\nIf three tiers are not used, the arrangement may be set within a hall or palace according to the directions.\n\nThe middle tier establishes eight gates:\n- Northwest: the Gate of Cloudy Jade Vacuity for Communicating with the Perfected\n- Due north: the Gate of Clear and Cold Mysterious Unity\n- Northeast: the Gate of Tranquil and Natural Stability\n- Due east: the Gate of Azure Florescence and Primordial Birth\n- Southeast: the Gate of Pure Harmony and Vigorous Yang\n- Due south: the Gate of Pure Yang’s Radiant Brilliance\n- Southwest: the Gate of Earth’s Compliance and Metallic Harmony\n- Due west: the Gate of Firm Clarity and Luminous Splendor\n\nThe lower tier arranges the twelve *qi*:\n- *Zi* position: the *qi* of Dark Heaven’s Gathering Beginning\n- *Chou* position: the *qi* of Northern Primordial Naturalness\n- *Yin* position: the *qi* of Dispelling Wrong and Sweeping Away Evil\n- *Mao* position: the *qi* of Primordial Flourishing Azure\n- *Chen* position: the *qi* of Yellow Numinosity and Lofty Mystery\n- *Si* position: the *qi* of Tranquil Numinosity and Serene Peace\n- *Wu* position: the *qi* of Fiery Perfection’s Descending Brilliance\n- *Wei* position: the *qi* of Central Unity and Congealed Perfection\n- *Shen* position: the *qi* of Profound Harmony and Solemn Clarity\n- *You* position: the *qi* of Firm Solidity and Pristine Harmony\n- *Xu* position: the *qi* of True Primordial Nurturing Spirit\n- *Hai* position: the *qi* of Returning Yin and Reverting to Perfection\n\nWith these three tiers, the altar is complete.\n\nThe establishment of the Imperial Altar is not solely for delivering sentient beings. It is also used for submitting petitions and requesting mandates, paying homage to the sages and attending the perfected, averting disasters and repenting transgressions, praying for longevity and seeking blessings for the state and the people, recommending and elevating ancestral spirits, refining and delivering the departed, and beseeching heaven through the construction of jiao rites. All such matters should employ it.\n\n*Illustration of the Three-Tiered Imperial Altar*\n*Protocol for Revering the Sages*\n\n**Divine Titles of Heavenly Deities**\n\n*The Book* states: Heaven is called *shen* (spirit), Earth is called *qi* (deity), and humans are called *gui* (ghosts).\n\nHeaven is called *shen* because it is the pure yang, azure, numinous *qi*—spontaneously generating and transforming, concentrating the essence of *qi*, hence the name *shen*. Earth is called *qi* because it receives the numinous essence of heaven, earth, seas, and mountains, embodying the wonder of spontaneity, hence the name *qi*. Humans are called *gui* because all mortals, upon death, are termed *gui*. Even those who cultivate the Dao and attain perfection cannot escape death, leaving dry bones among the living. Though exalted, are they not ultimately still called *lower ghosts*? Thus, they are termed *gui*.\n\nThe supreme spirits of the heavens are honored as *Heavenly Venerables*.\n\n**Yuanshi Tianzun (Primordial Heavenly Venerable)**\nThe Lord of Creation, the origin of all beings. His true name is unknowable; Laozi provisionally called him the *Dao*. Thus, his divine title is established as *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning).\n\n**Haotian Yuhuang Shangdi (Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven)**\nThis is Heaven itself. Lacking a proper name, it is called *Haotian* (Vast Heaven). The Yellow Emperor honored him as *Yuhuang* (Jade Emperor), dwelling in the highest heaven, hence also called *Shangdi* (Supreme Emperor).\n\n**Houtu Huangdiqi (August Deity of Earth)**\nThe mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks must each have a spirit to govern them. Lacking a proper name, the Yellow Emperor honored her as *Houtu Huangdiqi* (August Deity of Earth).\n\n**Sun**\nThe Yellow Emperor honored him as *Taiyang Dijun* (Great Yang Emperor Lord).\n\n**Moon**\nThe Yellow Emperor honored her as *Taiyin Huangjun* (Great Yin August Lord).\n\n**Beichen (Northern Culmen)**\nThe pivot of heaven, master of all phenomena. All stars revolve around it, occupying the *zi* position, hence the title *Beichen* (Northern Culmen).\n\n**Five Directions and Five Emperors**\nHeaven has five stars corresponding to the Five Phases. The spirits of the Five Phases govern the five directions:\n- Eastern spirit: *Qingling Dijun* (Azure Numinous Emperor Lord)\n- Southern spirit: *Danling Dijun* (Vermilion Numinous Emperor Lord)\n- Western spirit: *Haoling Dijun* (Radiant Numinous Emperor Lord)\n- Northern spirit: *Xuanling Dijun* (Mysterious Numinous Emperor Lord)\n- Central spirit: *Yuanling Dijun* (Primordial Numinous Emperor Lord)\n\n**Nine Chen (Nine Celestial Sovereigns)**\nThe Nine Chen are:\n1. *Changsheng Dadi* (Great Emperor of Longevity)\n2. *Qinghua Dadi* (Great Emperor of Azure Splendor)\n3. *Puhua Tianzun* (Heavenly Venerable of Universal Transformation)\n4. *Leizu Dadi* (Great Emperor Ancestor of Thunder)\n5. *Dayi Tiandi* (Heavenly Emperor of Great Unity)\n6. *Dongyuan Dadi* (Great Emperor of the Abyssal Cavern)\n7. *Liubo Dijun* (Emperor Lord of the Six Waves)\n8. *Kehan Zhenjun* (Perfected Lord of Approval)\n9. *Caifang Zhenjun* (Perfected Lord of Investigation)\n\nThey are the nine *qi* transformations of *Yuanshi*, hence titled the *Nine Chen Shangdi* (Nine Celestial Supreme Emperors), who act on behalf of Heaven to govern creation and rule all spirits.\n\n**Protocol for Revering the Sages**\n*Illustrations of Sacred Images*\n\n**Sacred Images in China**\n\nIn China, divine images were traditionally carved from jade—such as the white jade likeness of the Primordial True Countenance placed in the lofty observatory by the Yellow Emperor. Later generations, lacking jade, resorted to clay sculpture. As clay corresponds to the central earth, it is adorned with the five colors to encompass the attributes of the five directions, thereby rectifying the *qi* of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nImages of deities of the eastern direction are carved from wood, while those of the western direction are cast in metal. Images of the southern direction also employ wood, for wood is born of fire. Images of the northern direction are likewise cast in metal, as metal is born of water. All take their forms from their respective correspondences.\n\n**Sacred Thrones**\nThe throne of sacred images follows the style of a dragon couch. The screen behind it features dragon heads with mouths holding five-colored knotted silks. The screens must depict a single dragon in full relief; floral or abstract patterns are forbidden. The proper form must adhere to the Chinese tradition.\n\nIn the Hall of the Three Clarities, the Nine Chen and Nine Emperors should be sculpted on either side. In the Hall of the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors should be placed on both sides. On the walls of these two halls, the assembly of the Ten Thousand Sages paying homage to the Primordial should be painted.\n\nIn the Hall of the Dark Emperor, the various deities of the Thunder Department should be sculpted on either side. On the walls within, the deeds of the Dark Emperor’s cultivation of the Dao should be depicted.\n\nIn the Hall of the Perfected Lord Xu, the ranks of immortals should be sculpted on either side. On the walls within, scenes of ascending to heaven with one’s entire household—riding simurghs and cranes, mounting the wind and commanding dragons, or floating among immortal companions—should be painted.\n\nIn the halls of temples and observatories dedicated to prayers for longevity, the central position should be occupied by the Great Emperor of Longevity. To his left, the Heavenly Venerable of Longevity and Life-Preservation; to his right, the Heavenly Venerable of Lifespan Extension and Destiny Augmentation. On either side, the Southern and Northern Dippers should be placed—on the left, the Southern Dipper for destiny augmentation, and on the right, the Northern Dipper for life extension. The Southern Dipper’s six deities should be complemented by the Star of Longevity to make seven, corresponding to the Northern Dipper.\n\nIn the Pavilion of the Star of Longevity, the Stars of Fortune and Emolument should be placed above, with the image of the Star of Longevity sculpted below.\n\n**Dragon Tablets**\nDaoist dragon tablets should not be ornately carved. I have reformed their design, making them solid and carved in the manner of jade, with the dragon fully visible on the exterior, its spine forming the border. Gold dragons and five-colored clouds are used to signify the virtue of encompassing the five directions. This innovation is my own.\n\n**Tortoise and Crane Censers**\nOn either side of the cinnabar steps, pairs of tortoise and crane censers—cast in bronze or iron—should be placed. For all jiao rituals, incense is burned within them to communicate with the immortals, allowing the fragrance to ascend to the heavens above.\n\n**Banners**\nThe banners used in Daoist rites symbolize the Three Powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. I have reformed their ancient design: the finial is made of paulownia or catalpa wood, adorned with the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and rosy dawn, with an image of the Heavenly Venerable painted above to represent Heaven. The body of the banner bears the names of the Heavenly Emperors, while the base features dragons and phoenixes. The side streamers, shaped like hands, are embellished with flying dragons and phoenixes among clouds, representing Humanity. The pendants, also made of paulownia or catalpa wood, depict mountains, rivers, the great earth, the Five Peaks, and the Four Waterways, representing Earth. Such a design was never seen in antiquity; it originates with me. The common practice of using lotus leaves for finials and lotus flowers for pendants is exceedingly vulgar.\n\n**Sun and Moon Lamps**\nBetween the pillars of every hall, fish-shaped lamps should be suspended, enveloped in clouds and mist, rising high between the architrave and crossbeam. The left lamp, colored red, symbolizes the sun; the right, white, symbolizes the moon. This innovation is also my own.\n\n**Offering Flowers**\nFlowers for offerings are carved from paulownia wood in the form of *lingzhi* mushrooms, symbolizing the auspicious tokens of immortality. A peony stem with five-colored blossoms, nine feet tall and adorned with gold thread, evokes the legend of Han Xiangzi, whose flowers instantly bloomed in five colors—a sign of immortal auspiciousness.\n\n**Offerings of the Five Phases**\nThe five offerings—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—symbolize the generative and restraining cycles of Heaven and Earth’s creation, aligning with the virtue of the divine.\n- **Metal**: Cast in copper or iron ingots, gilded with gold foil. Pure gold is avoided for fear of theft.\n- **Wood**: Represented by incense, carved into miniature mountains for display.\n- **Water**: Sacred water, contained in a vessel.\n- **Fire**: Represented by lamps.\n- **Earth**: Yellow soil shaped into a cube with eight facets, carved with the Eight Trigrams for display.\n\n**Offering Fruits**\nFruits for offerings should be carved from wood: peaches of longevity, intertwined pears, fiery jujubes, plums from the Dark Garden, and melons from Kunlun.\n\n**Incense Offerings**\n*Jiangzhen* incense is the sacred incense for worshipping the Heavenly Emperor. Apart from this, *chenxiang* and *suxiang* are secondary. *Xinling* incense can convey one’s sincerity to the Heavenly Emperor. Incense to be avoided includes benzoin, frankincense, and sandalwood—foreign concoctions forbidden by celestial law. Utmost caution is required.\n\n**Ingredients for Xinling Incense**\n- *Jiangzhen* (5 *qian*)\n- *Yujin* (5 *qian*)\n- *Chenxiang* (5 *qian*)\n- *Suxiang* (5 *qian*)\n- *Leixiang* (8 *qian*)\n- *Gaoben* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Gansong* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Baizhi* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Lingling* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Dahuang* (2 *qian*)\n- *Xiangfu* (2 *qian*)\n- *Xuanshen* (2 *qian*)\n\nTo compound the incense, on the day before the *jiazi* day, arrange the ingredients in a quiet chamber designated for incense preparation. Set up the tablets of the Five *Zi* Deities, and offer incense and lamps with utmost purity. The five deities presiding are:\n- The Spirit of *Jiazi*\n- The Spirit of *Bingzi*\n- The Spirit of *Wuzi*\n- The Spirit of *Gengzi*\n- The Spirit of *Renzi*\n\n**Method for Compounding Xinling Incense**\n- On the *jiazi* day: Gather the ingredients.\n- On the *bingzi* day: Grind them.\n- On the *wuzi* day: Mix them together.\n- On the *gengzi* day: Form them into pellets.\n- Offer them upon the Heavenly Altar on the *renzi* day.\n- On the following *jia* day, store them in gourds and hang them up.\n\nThereafter, burn one pellet daily to worship Heaven. This incense is not for common use; in times of urgent prayer, burning it can invoke the virtue of the divine. If one encounters peril on the road—such as bandits, storms at sea, or other dangers—and lacks fire, chew the incense and spit it upward to avert calamity.\n\n**Celestial Music and Regalia**\nCelestial music refers to the orchestral arrangements in the hall. Its origins trace back to the time when the Yellow Emperor convened the assembly of spirits on the western slopes of Kunlun. He commanded Ling Lun to gather bamboo from the Valley of Slackening and craft panpipes, flutes, and reed pipes to summon the phoenix.\n\nThe phoenix cried out. He forged bells and chimes to harmonize the pitch-pipes and determine the intercalary months of the year. Taking the hide of Kui, he made drums to offer to the Heavenly Emperor. Then, combining the zither and sehtar crafted by Fuxi, he composed music, whereupon all the spirits gathered, the beasts danced in unison, and the phoenix came in pairs. By the time of Emperor Yao’s grand sacrifice at the Round Mound to worship the Heavenly Emperor, the ancient rites had faded with time, losing their original essence. Emperor Wu of Han then commanded the musician Hou Tiao to craft the konghou harp to match the celestial sounds, revising the music. Later, Daoist masters were ordered to perform the grand *Celestial Music* in the Palace of Vast Heaven to worship the Three Pure Ones, naming it *Music of the Three Pure Ones*.\n\n**Hymn of the Three Pure Ones’ Celestial Music**\nGazing up at the Dragon Chariot of the Vast Heavens,\nThe Emperor descends to the Jade Palace.\nRainbow banners and feathered canopies follow the celestial beings;\nYour servant leads the feathered immortals below to offer reverence.\nWitness my sincerity, as my devotion ascends;\nI bow my head in homage, praying for the longevity of the people.\nMay the imperial legacy endure for ten thousand generations,\nAnd the kingdom’s prosperity and blessings know no end.\nWith this precious incense, I supplicate the boundless heavens,\nUniversally offering to the Heavenly Sovereign.\nA wisp of auspicious smoke coils upward;\nThe people lift their voices in hope of eternal grace.\n\n**Instruments of the Music**\n- *Drum of Thunderous Assembly*: The grand *fengfeng* drum.\n- *Key of Azure Sky’s Resonance*: The great bell.\n- *Bell of Ten Thousand Gold’s Echo*: Sixteen pitch-responsive bells on the rack.\n- *Chime of Jade and Lapis*: Sixteen pitch-responsive chimes on the rack.\n- *Cluster of Luminous Jade from the Jasper Pool*: The *taotao* drum.\n- *Chime of Truth-Permeating Clarity*: The hand chime.\n- *Golden Bell of Jade Sky*: The golden bell.\n- *Jade Chime of the Jade Pure Heaven*: The jade chime.\n- *Zither of Grand Harmony by Taihao*: The zither.\n- *Pipe of Cloud-Quelling Jade*: The reed pipe.\n- *Sehtar of the Xiang Spirit’s Ethereal Clarity*: The sehtar.\n- *Flute of Celestial Immortal Sounds*: A harp-like instrument with coiled strings.\n- *Ruan of Moonlit Jasper Terrace*: The ruan.\n- *Cymbals of the Roaring Dragon and Commanding Crow*: The cymbals.\n- *Pipes of Azure Flower Jade Heaven*: The sheng.\n- *Flute of Cloud-Soaring Wind*: The flute.\n- *Drum of the Wind-Roaring Celestial Alligator*: The hand drum, called *Jade Rite*.\n- *Clappers of Jasper Terrace’s Jade*: The jade clappers.\n- *Gong of Red Sky’s Resonance*: The gong.\n- *Filler of Harmonious Tones*: The *tian* (sound-filling instrument).\n- *Curtain of Grand Harmony’s Preservation*: The *lian* (harmony-preserving screen).\n- *Prayer of Five Tones’ Concord*: The prayer of harmonized notes.\n- *Yue of Eight Tones’ Ninefold Completion*: The *yu* (wooden tiger).\n\nThis was the music used by the Yellow Emperor to worship the Three Pure Ones. Today, only bells, drums, sheng, xiao, *yun’ao*, and *xianlai* are employed. It is used when ascending the altar to pay homage to the Perfected and audience the Emperor, while for daily rituals and scripture recitations, ordinary immortal music suffices.\n\n**Emperor’s Bell**\nWhen the Yellow Emperor convened the spirits on Kunlun’s peak, the Heavenly Emperor bestowed upon him the *Emperor’s Bell*. Daoists speak of \"grasping the Emperor’s Bell, hurling fire for ten thousand miles, and ringing the bells of the eight directions.\" The Heavenly Soldiers wield it, also calling it the *Fire Bell*. During Emperor Daizong’s reign, the Hu monk Amoghavajra held the *Ullambana* assembly and replaced the chime with the Daoist *Emperor’s Bell*, later modifying its head for use as a bell.\n\n**Cymbals and Handbells**\nWhen Chiyou drove tigers and leopards to battle the Yellow Emperor, the latter forged cymbals and handbells to defeat them, for the beasts feared their sound. They also startle and dispel demons. During Empress Wu’s reign, the monk Huaiyi claimed that during the Buddha’s lifetime, demons—led by Mara—had hidden, served poisoned meals, dug fire pits, smeared the Buddha with filth and blood, and trampled him with elephants. The Buddha sought to destroy them, but the demons declared, \"Our kind is vast; we shall later destroy your Way.\" Thus, Huaiyi used cymbals and handbells in every ritual to startle and expel demons. Empress Wu remarked, \"Though cymbals can frighten demons, how can the souls of our ancestors be summoned to partake in offerings? If even demons are startled, how much more so ghosts?\" She ordered Daoist rites for the living and the dead to employ them, but their use should be strictly prohibited.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: \"Once, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the mysterious and wondrous Dharma Gate of the Numinous Treasure, delivering the method of transcendence. He assembled the immortals at the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure in the Void Star Heaven. The celestial processions thronged, with the sun, moon, and stars, the jade armillary sphere, divine beasts, phoenixes, vermilion chariots, green carriages, banners, canopies, and rainbow flags all in attendance. Those who perform the Dao, establishing altars and steps, follow the celestial rites to deliver the people of the lower world. I once witnessed in the void the feathered banners, crimson tassels, dragon flags, and phoenix chariots of the heavenly beings. Emulating their form, I reformed the ancient methods and created the *Immortal Regalia*. Below are their depictions:\n\n- *Banners of the Purified Yellow Path*: One pair\n- *Banners of Proclaiming to the Myriad Spirits*: One pair\"\n\n- *Banners for Quelling and Subduing the Hundred Demons*: One pair\n- *Threads of the Nine August Ones’ Myriad Ages*: One pair\n- *Banners of the Three Clarities’ Divine Rainbow*: One pair\n- *Pennants of the Supreme Subtlety’s Commanding Spirits*: One pair\n- *Pennons of the Great Clarity’s Utmost Mystery*: One set—one side painted with a dragon, the other with a tiger\n- *Scarlet Nodes of the Five Spirits’ Crimson Empyrean*: One pair\n- *Ruyi Scepters of the Nine Heavens’ Demon-Subduing*: One pair\n- *Fans of the Nine Empyreans’ Cloud-Wings*: One pair\n- *Fans of the Fragrant Clouds of Yu Luo*: One pair\n- *Canopies of the Divine Recitation’s Flying Rosy Clouds*: One pair\n- *Lanterns for Dispelling Darkness*: One pair\n- *Lanterns of the Crimson Empyrean’s Divine Flame*: One pair\n- *Lamps of the Heavenly Thoroughfare’s Fragrant Empyrean*: One pair\n- *Incense Pavilion of the Vermilion Phoenix Presenting Auspiciousness*\n- *Chariot of the Divine Dragons Bearing the Sage*\n\nThe above *Immortal Regalia* are made with vermilion poles and jeweled canopies, adorned with pearl nets, silk, and colored fabrics, meticulously painted and arranged with solemnity. They are arrayed on the four sides of the outer altar. During each morning’s *Step of the Void* procession, Daoist acolytes each hold one piece of the *Immortal Regalia*, harmonizing their *Huaxia* chants as they follow the ranks, circling the imperial altar. They are not to be used except during altar rites and morning audiences, at which times they are arranged on stands at the altar’s four sides.\n\nIn later ages, when the Dao’s fortune waned and its teachings declined, these were made of paper, burned at the end of the *jiao* rites like funerary objects—this practice is greatly to be avoided.\n\n- *Furnace for the Heavenly Perfected’s Demon-Commanding*\n- *Demon-Commanding Pennon with Six-Face Talismans*\n\nTwo-Face, Three-Face, Four-Face, Five-Face, and Six-Face *Lion-Warding Ritual Batons* and *Tally Batons*. The *Pennon for the Heavenly Perfected’s Demon-Commanding* is set to the left of the *Altar of Heavenly Treasure* to ward off evil, while the *Lion-Warding Ritual Baton* is placed to its right. Both are made with vermilion poles and jeweled canopies, their pennon bodies woven with pearl strands and crafted from paulownia wood. The six-faced pennon bears one talismanic inscription per face, lacquered in vermilion and gilded, with all others fashioned according to the same pattern. Whenever the Dharma Master performs the *Step of the Void* procession, two acolytes hold these implements, attending at his left and right, circling in unison. Thus does the Dao command reverence through solemn ritual, and the heart stand in awe before its sacred forms, never straying into delusion or disorder.\n\nThose who cultivate immortality must empty the heart and still the nature, their virtue perfected and their spirit attuned to the True Sovereign. With a single thought, resonance is achieved, and the heart of Heaven merges as one—what need have they for external rites to commune with the Real? Yet since the ancient forms exist, how can they now be abandoned? Thus are they preserved.\n\n*Illustrations of Lanterns for the Altar of Heaven*\nThe lanterns used in *jiao* altars once numbered over a hundred varieties. Here are recorded ten commonly used types, as the full array is too numerous to include in full. The illustrations are as follows:\n\n*Illustration of the Jade Emperor’s Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Lantern of the Celestial Circuit*\n\n*Illustration of the Life-Spirit Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Northern Dipper Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Southern Dipper Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Three Luminaries and Dipper Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Nine Heavens Jade Pivot Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Fire Virtue Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Nine Palaces Eight Trigrams Earth Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Blood Lake Hell Lantern*\n*Illustration of the Refinement and Salvation Lantern*\n*Great Tenuous Yellow Banner of the Supreme Subtlety*\n*Banner of the Peerless Spirit of Destiny*\n\n*Complete Perfection Ritual Regulations*\nWhen sitting the alms-bowl ritual, one bowl may accommodate eight, twelve, or twenty-four persons. For those in grand alms-bowl halls, the number may reach a hundred—this is not subject to the same limits.\n\nFour offices are established:\n1. The *Master of the Bowl*, with\n2. two *Deputy Masters of the Bowl*, who lead the left and right ranks, seated in the upper seats to preside over the proceedings.\nAdditionally, two *Attendants of the Left and Right Halls* are appointed, seated near the door facing inward to oversee the sitting practice, regulating the timing of entry, exit, rising, and the placement and removal of the alms-bowl.\n\nNo patrols of the hall, no enforced sitting, no disciplinary measures, and no reprimands are permitted. Once within the *Circular Hall*, the Daoist assembly engages in the alms-bowl practice out of reverence for the great matter of life and death, refining body and heart to transcend the suffering of mortality and ascend to the ranks of the sagely. How could this be compelled by force or coercion? All such measures are entirely abolished.\n\nSome employ the six periods for sitting the bowl, but excessive practice without proper application often leads to wind-paralysis ailments. It is far better to limit the practice to the four periods of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*, drawing upon the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth—this is most efficacious.\n\nThose who enter the enclosure engage in the foundational work of stillness, refining spirit and form. After a hundred days, the practice may begin. Without the oral instructions of a true master, or if one’s own application is insufficient, the practice may instead induce illness, becoming a harmful art. Utmost caution is advised.\n\nThe alms-bowl sitting period commences on the fifteenth day of the second month and concludes on the fifteenth day of the fifth month.\n\nFrom the fifteenth day of the seventh month to the fifteenth day of the tenth month, and from the fifteenth day of the tenth month to the fifteenth day of the first month of the following year. Within a year, only two bowl-sitting periods are observed, as the summer months are too hot for practice.\n\nOutside the bowl hall, a *yunban* (cloud-shaped gong) and a *muyu* (wooden fish drum) are placed. On either side of the central hall, single mats are arranged for sitting, with two small bells positioned in front: the right is called the \"movement bell,\" and the left the \"stillness bell.\" Each day at the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours, when the appointed time arrives, the assembly enters the hall and takes their seats, awaiting the designated attendant’s strikes to signal the opening and closing of the session, as well as the order of movement and stillness. The daily ritual for entering the hall and taking one’s seat is described below.\n\nA signboard for opening and closing the hall is placed outside the door, inscribed with red characters on a gold plaque. When the senior practitioner is seated, the characters for \"closing the hall\" face outward, and no one may enter. Upon concluding the session, the sound of the *yunban* serves as the signal, and the characters for \"opening the hall\" are turned outward.\n\n**Method for Determining the Bowl-Sitting Period**\nOn clear, sunny days, the bowl is first placed atop the water vessel, and the sundial is used to mark the time. When the shadow just reaches the initial quarter of the *wu* hour, the bowl is set upon the water vessel. By the time the *wu* hour transitions into the *wei* hour—specifically the initial quarter of *wei*—the bowl must sink, causing the five bells to chime in unison, thus marking the full hour before the session may conclude. If the bowl fails to sink at the appointed time, slightly enlarge the water outlet beneath it. If it sinks prematurely, the outlet is too large and must be adjusted to a smaller size, ensuring precise alignment with the hour.\n\nWhen the bowl is placed at the initial quarter of the *wu* hour, the Daoist assembly takes their seats. By the final quarter of *wu* approaching the initial quarter of *wei*, the bowl sinks into the water, and the five bells resound—only then may the assembly rise. This method ensures the timing remains exact, and future practitioners should follow this as their standard.\n\n**Design of the Bowl Stand**\nIn ancient times, a small chamber resembling an incense pavilion was constructed, with a *Taiji* circle suspended by a rope from the pavilion’s beam. A bell hung within the circle, and the bowl was struck beneath it. A water vat held the bowl to mark the time.\n\nI have since reformed this system, replacing it with a stand. The stand’s two ends are adorned with colored tassels, and a jeweled canopy hangs at its center. A chime with five bells is installed within, and the bowl strikes the canopy above. When the hour arrives and the bowl fills with water, it sinks, causing all five bells to ring in harmony—a design unlike any found in the secular world, first devised by me.\n\n**Quanzhen Ritual for Entering the Hall**\nWhen a Quanzhen Daoist on pilgrimage first arrives at a temple or abbey and enters the bowl hall, they are led by the Master of Ceremonies to pay respects before the ancestral master. First, three incense offerings are made. After the Master of Ceremonies recites the *Cantang* text, a nine-prostration bow is performed. The practitioner then retires from the hall to join the assembly for tea.\n\n**Cantang Text**\nIn search of kindred spirits,\nI wander lakes and seas.\n\nWith staff and bamboo hat, half a lifetime spent in carefree wandering. Unfettered by wild waters and idle clouds, ten years of roaming now weary me. Girded with a sword that props up the heavens, I command all spirits to tremble in the void; embracing a three-foot withered paulownia zither, I strike celestial notes to summon the crisp qi of the firmament—startling gibbons and cranes in the empty mountains, subduing tigers and coaxing dragons to roar over autumn waters. Thus do I dwell beside the Great Void, befriending wind and moon, in such refined seclusion—how magnificent! Truly immortal!\n\nMoreover, with a staff I pierce through boundless green mountains, with my feet I tread across the ten directions’ clouds and waters. Though I have yet to shatter the void, I must forge mortal bones into something transcendent. If an iron pestle can be ground into a needle, how can the Golden Elixir not be achieved? Should the secret strike true and the Dao align with the subtle, what I study is no heterodox or unorthodox deviation, but the Great Way of China’s sages. This path can shatter the demonic barrier, erasing my name from the ledgers of darkness; it can ascend me to the celestial courts, inscribing my name in the Register of Gold. Awaiting the day I soar on azure skies, riding a white crane above the winds of jade; for now, I feast on yellow essence and purple mushrooms, lingering in the valleys and gorges.\n\nI have savored the cool breeze and bright moon, tasting the wonders of the Dao; I have struck golden bells and wielded jade dust-whisks, plumbing the depths of the mysterious. Across the ends of the earth I sought the lofty, yet like unyielding iron I have not met my lodestone; like needle and mustard seed, we have not yet found affinity. Thus today I come especially in search of truth.\n\nBy chance I arrive here, daring to trespass upon the ancestral master’s hall. Ashamed of my rustic manners, I humbly offer incense in sincerity, invoking: the Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor; the Dao Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao; the northern and southern lineages; and all the perfected immortals and sages of past ages. Reverently, I address the esteemed master presiding over the bowl hall, the immortal companions and perfected peers within these jade halls—whose Dao bones are already formed, whose immortal aura has long been manifest. We, mere blades of grass and motes of dust, base as mist and clouds, by the faintest thread of root-qi have been permitted to enter the supreme and wondrous gate. Granted the great honor of ascending the hall, we offer this initial rite of courtesy. For a time, we set aside our gourds and bamboo hats to follow you, discussing the Dao and expounding the mysterious in your company. From this moment of reverence, we humbly beseech your guidance. Together we keep the first watch on cold nights, together we observe the Gengshen vigil, speaking of past and future lives.\n\nWith bowed reverence, the ritual concludes, and tea is received.\n\n**Rite for Receiving the Bowl and Settling into a Cell**\n\nBefore the alms bowl, arrange the grand incense table, with one large incense burner and two hand censers. The principal bowl-holder, the secondary bowl-holder, and the left and right duty-hall attendants together—with the entire assembly following their ranks—form two rows to stand in reverent alignment. A Dao child is then instructed to deliver the address.\n\n**Address Upon Entering the Garden:**\nWe bow in reverence, for golden lotuses offer auspicious omens, and the Seven Perfected transmit the profound words of their legacy. Cloud-script radiates its brilliance, and for ten thousand generations, all look up to the wondrous subtleties of the Recluse. The establishment of this garden serves to return to the root and restore the mandate; the seating in the alms-bowl hall serves to abandon delusion and return to truth. When the four great elements align with the seasons, one suddenly realizes the cosmos resides within; when the five bells resound, one discerns that essence and function share a single source. We humbly pray for the silent blessings of heaven and earth, for the workings of creation to aid our refined aspirations, for the mountain spirits to maintain tranquility, and for the realm to remain serene. May the ten directions be pure and flawless today, revealing the hidden and manifesting the subtle—where not even a speck of red dust can reach, and the spirit is refined to return to emptiness. The Dao precedes the Lord of Images; the body abides above the Pure Capital.\n\nNow, we Dao assembly, by the slightest merit of past good deeds, have been permitted to dwell in these renowned mountains. Ashamed that we possess no rare immortal blossoms or true elixir, we can only harbor the idle fancy of a moonlit jade pool. Yet in our eagerness to advance in cultivation, we must not yield to others; though the Dao does not exalt the individual, we must first master ourselves. The grotto-heaven lies on level ground—we watch as phoenixes and cranes are summoned in the azure world. Even our very bodies are but horses and men; we tether the monkey-mind within the garden chamber.\n\nToday, we shall silently ascend to the Celestial Court and mount the Golden Portal, observing stillness once daily to guard the Central Yellow and seal the Jade Pass.\n\nThe address concludes.\n\nThe left duty-hall attendant, holding a hand censer, escorts the principal bowl-holder to the incense table. Three offerings of incense are made before returning to position. The right duty-hall attendant, holding a hand censer, escorts the secondary bowl-holder to the incense table. Three offerings of incense are made before returning to position. Then, together with the entire assembly, all perform a nine-bow ritual facing upward.\n\nThe left duty-hall attendant leads the left row, beginning with the principal bowl-holder down to the lowest seat, settling each into their place. A single bow is made to each before withdrawing, after which one returns to their own seat. The right duty-hall attendant, also holding a hand censer, leads the right row to settle into their seats, following the same ritual—only a single bow is made, without full prostration.\n\nThe right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell three times. Once completed, the duty officer presents the seating chart, and the alms bowl is carried out the door. The cloud board is struck three times, and the placard is turned to display \"Closed Gate.\" Returning to the hall, they approach the incense table to offer three major incense offerings. Next, hand-censer incense is offered: holding the censer, they bow once before the principal bowl-holder, then proceed in order to bow once before each member of the assembly. Returning to the incense table, three incense offerings and three bows are made. The left duty-hall attendant then strikes the stillness bell three times, and the duty officer enters their seat to await the sound of the bell. The right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell five times, and the duty officer rises to open the door, striking the cloud board five times. The placard is turned to display \"Gate Opened.\"\n\n**Daily Ritual for Ascending the Hall and Settling into Seats:**\nWhenever the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, or *you* arrive, the duty officer first strikes the wooden fish six times to assemble the assembly for ascending the hall and settling into seats. Once completed, the right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell three times. The duty officer then presents the alms bowl and exits the door, turning the placard to display \"Closed Gate.\" The cloud board is struck three times. Returning to the hall, they approach the incense table to offer three incense offerings and three bows. Next, hand-censer incense is offered: holding the censer, they bow once before their own bowl-holder, then proceed in order to bow once before each seated member of the assembly—no full prostration is performed. Returning to the incense table, three incense offerings and three bows are made. The duty officer then enters their seat. The left duty-hall attendant strikes the stillness bell three times. After the bell’s resonance fades, the right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell five times, and the duty officer rises to open the door, striking the cloud board five times. The placard is turned to display \"Gate Opened,\" and the assembly exits their seats.\n\n**Regulations on Headgear and Robes:**\nThe headgear and robes of antiquity are those of the Yellow Emperor’s time.\n\nSince the Later Zhao ruler King Wuling altered them to Hu-style garments, China’s attire gradually transformed, until Emperor Yang of Sui, for convenience in hunting expeditions, adopted Hu dress entirely. Only the robes and headgear of Daoist priests remained unchanged, hence the term \"Yellow Crown.\"\n\n**Tongtian Crown**\nA design of my own creation. Within, a hair-binding cap is worn; atop it, the Three Terraces. In front, the Southern Dipper; behind, the Northern Dipper. To the left and right, the sun and moon. Above, a crown of curling clouds, secured with tassels. When wearing the Tongtian Robe, this crown is donned—known as the sovereign’s crown, not to be used by any but the king.\n\n**Tongtian Robe**\nA design of my own creation. The robe is of dark hue with a yellow lining, comprising an upper garment and lower skirt. On the chest, the Vermilion Bird; on the back, the Dark Warrior; on the left shoulder, the Azure Dragon; on the right shoulder, the White Tiger—representing the Four Spirits, all embroidered in gold. At the front, two sashes of dragon and tiger. The lower skirt has twelve panels, corresponding to the twelve months. The bordered hem evokes the image of cosmic boundaries. This is the raiment of emperors who attain the Dao and ascend in flight—worn only for offering sacrifices to Heaven and serving the gods, not for ordinary men.\n\n**Jiejin Headwrap**\nMy original design, made of dark fabric. Two styles exist for winter and summer, unrestricted by material—silk or linen—forming a distinct tradition unlike common attire. Not to be worn by any but the king.\n\n**Xuejin Headwrap**\nMy original design, woven from dark ramie silk, lined with swan down. Worn during snow and bitter cold to protect the head.\n\n**Leijin Headwrap**\nThe casual headwear of mountain-dwelling Daoists, akin to the attire of rustics. In ancient times, there was no net headwrap; it was worn to contain unruly hair or shield the head from cold. How could such a thing be proper for court audiences before the emperor or for ceremonial occasions? Mountain recluses and cultivators of the Dao, regardless of rank, all wear it. Nowadays, frivolous scholars seeking self-importance don it as if they were officials on duty. Wu Caolu’s poem on the Leijin reads:\n\n*For mountain rustics indolent, a shield from cold—*\n*How could it suit those calling on the court?*\n*In this degenerate age, customs are impure;*\n*Yet fleeing to the Dao’s gate, they don the Zhengyi crown.*\n\nThis is precisely the point.\n\n**Net Headwrap**\n\nThe net headwrap did not exist in ancient times; it was first created during the Hongwu era of Our Dynasty. Its circular frame is large and distinct from common designs.\n\n**Cap**\nThe cap’s construction allows for trailing headscarves as adornment. It may be made from lightweight materials like rattan, bamboo, or fine gauze, just as in secular use.\n\n**Lacquered Cap**\nShaped like a cloud hat, its platform is lacquered black, without a covering.\n\n**Rain Hat**\nWoven from bamboo sheath or birch bark to shield against rain, dew, and sunlight. The lightest and simplest kind is made from rattan or bamboo roots, which is also quite elegant, though some may find it overly ornate. A larger version that rests on the shoulders is called the \"well-frame hat,\" particularly favored by Quanzhen Daoists and wandering cloud-and-water mendicants.\n\n**Snow Hat**\nHexagonal at the top, with a narrow crown and wide brim. It is covered with black silk or gauze to block wind, sand, and sunlight, used by those seeking the truth or visiting masters during travels.\n\n**Rustic Hat**\nConstructed with a bamboo frame, layered with saltwater-boiled *xiao-xie* leaves to repel rain and snow—suitable for mountain dwellers.\n\n**Ritual Robe**\n\n**Yellow Emperor’s Attire**\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor beheld the Celestial Beings, he wore a golden lotus crown, its petals rising and bowing above, and a ritual robe adorned with golden stars, constellations, clouds, and rosy dawn. Holding a jade tablet, he advanced and said: \"The Emperor toils in heart for all under heaven, governing the people with life-bestowing virtue—this is true power.\" Thus, he first embodied their form to create the ritual robe, which became the Daoist vestment for worshipping Heaven.\n\n**Shangqing Ritual Robe**\nA cloak of purple and azure, purple on the outside and azure within. Its width spans four feet and nine inches, corresponding to the numbers of the four seasons. Its length measures five feet and five inches, aligning with the qi of Heaven and Earth. The outer and inner layers follow one rule: the outer bears twenty-four strips, the inner fifteen, together corresponding to the thirty-nine stations of the Perfected Celestial Emperors. Only when clad in this imperial vestment may one proceed. Without it, one must not recklessly handle the sacred scriptures. This ritual robe is bestowed upon twelve jade lads; it may not be lent to others, nor defiled by impurity, lest the divine vestment be treated with irreverence.\n\n**Female Perfected’s Attire**\nA purple gauze robe, two zhang and four chi in length, with sleeves cut to fit comfortably. The sleeves are divided into sixteen strips, the body into twenty-three, totaling thirty-nine strips. Additionally, an azure gauze skirt is made, requiring fifteen chi of fabric, cut into eight panels each four feet and nine inches long. The remaining fabric forms the waistband, divided into eight panels with thirty-two strips—this is the \"flying azure skirt.\" Without this ritual robe, one may not chant the sacred scriptures of Shangqing. This vestment is bestowed upon twelve jade maidens; it may not be lent to others, nor defiled by impurity, lest the divine vestment be treated with irreverence.\n\n**Cave-Dwelling Attire**\nDesigned by Kou Qianzhi.\n\n**Robe**\nThe scriptures speak of the \"crane-wing robe, frosted and dense.\" In modern times, people loosely add a border a chi wide, its design identical to the crane cloak.\n\n**Crane Cloak**\nWorn by all Daoists, its color unrestricted. Those of profound virtue use black; ordinary Daoists dare not.\n\n**Fur Garment**\nIn high antiquity, people wore hides and pelts. Daoists often used deer fur for robes, as deer are creatures of transcendence. Later generations favored fox fur.\n\n**Padded Jacket**\nA variant name for the *nuo* robe, existing since ancient times. For those who have left the household life or dwell in mountains to cultivate the Dao—unable to escape the cycles of yin and yang or the cold and heat—such garments are essential to ward off wind and chill, and must never be lacking.\n\n**Half-Sleeves**\nA short-sleeved garment. Daoists use it as attire for watering flowers and tending herbs.\n\n**Belly Wrap**\nIts design resembles the common version, though padded or quilted to suitable thickness. Particularly vital for elderly mountain-dwelling Daoist learners.\n\n**Undershirt**\nThe garment worn closest to the body must be washed and kept immaculately clean to avoid defilement.\n\n**Short Robe**\nA garment reaching only to the waist, called a short robe. For mountain dwellers and those in the wild, it facilitates climbing and traversing. Ancient cultivators of the Dao sometimes likened it to the attire for gathering magic mushrooms.\n\n**Wide Sleeves**\nThe Daoist scriptures speak of \"azure skirts and feathered sleeves, dragon-patterned phoenix robes.\" In antiquity, there were \"radiant flying-cloud sleeves.\" Today, these are called *chuòxiù*—wide sleeves with a short body, paired with a lower skirt. Those who study the Dao must wear them.\n\n**Trousers**\n\n**Trousers**\nShaped like a skirt, with waistbands and ties at both ends. They must be washed and changed daily. Daoist practitioners who have left the household life should not remove their inner trousers even when briefly resting at night. Whether thickly padded or lightly lined, they must be kept clean and frequently refreshed, regularly infused with fragrant smoke to prevent the accumulation of foul qi.\n\n**Leggings**\nMade in single, lined, or padded layers according to the season, they should also be washed and changed frequently.\n\n**Arm Sleeves**\nThese garments serve two purposes: to maintain cleanliness and to ward off the cold. They are indispensable for Daoist cultivators.\n\n**Leg Wraps**\nNow called *xíngchán* (walking wraps). Particularly essential for those who traverse mountains with swift steps, they must be tightly secured.\n\n**Boots**\nBoots have rounded toes and wide soles. In ancient times, they were called *xuē*. While suitable for treading through filthy places, they should never be worn indoors. Though commonly used among laypeople, they are inappropriate for mountain dwellers.\n\n**Shoes**\nShoes may be made from wood, bark, bamboo, ramie, hemp, kudzu, or angelica, each chosen as available. However, they should not be crafted from silk, brocade, embroidered fabrics, or patterned leather—excessive luxury is unsuitable.\n\n**Sitting Mats**\nDaoist priests and female adepts carry scriptures, precepts, talismans, and celestial writings upon their persons. With true spirits attending their forms and Dao-qi guarding and protecting them, the garments they wear are called *fǎfú* (Dharma robes), revered and safeguarded by divine beings. When resting, they must maintain purity. If venturing among laypeople, they must not allow their sacred presence to be conflated with worldly affairs.\n\nOrdinary people’s mats accumulate considerable foul qi, so each person should have a sitting mat, four *chǐ* square, plainly wrapped with green edging. For great virtuous masters and those possessing the highest Dharma, purple is used; others employ *xiāng* (a pale reddish-brown) color. Brocade, embroidery, painted designs, pearl-encrusted trims, or ornate appliqués are forbidden. Daoist priests and female adepts should always spread a simple, single-layered mat to separate themselves from impurity, distinguishing rank as appropriate. They must carry it with them at all times, never setting it aside. When ascending altars, entering chambers, performing rituals, or attending feasts, they should also bring their incense burner and sitting mat, each taking care to uphold this practice without negligence.\n\n**Chapter on Cultivation Implements: Ruyi**\n\nThe *ruyi* was originally a weapon crafted by the Yellow Emperor to battle Chīyóu. Later generations modified it into the *gǔduo*, which celestial perfected beings wield to repel demonic hordes.\n\n**Alchemical Bowl**\nThe alchemical bowl’s design is ancient, found only among Daoist wanderers and cloud-roaming adepts, typically forged from iron. When entering mountains to gather herbs or lingzhi, where one may remain for days without returning, it serves for cooking rice. For household use in oratories, wooden bowls lacquered with *lài* are employed.\n\n**Yang-Sundial**\nIn antiquity, the yang-sundial was used to kindle fire for heating incense and invoking spirits. All elixir-refiners employ this fire, never common flame, hence its use among Daoists. For fire arises from the sundial, yet while the sundial is round, the flame is not. The *Cantong Qi* states: “The yang-sundial captures fire; without the sun, no light is born. Direct the sundial toward the sun, place mugwort beneath it, and fire may be obtained.”\n\n**Square Cauldron**\nWater is drawn from the square cauldron, yet though the cauldron is square, the water is not. The *Cantong Qi* also notes: “Without stars or moon, how could water be obtained? Its method: direct the cauldron toward the moon, place a cup beneath it, and water may be gathered.” In refining the Great Elixir, Daoists eschew common water, thus employing this water.\n\n**Thunder-Spirit Staff**\nWhile Quanzhen adepts all use plain shovels for ease in removing filth—a practice deemed vulgar and overly mundane—I fashion a *ruyi* from bronze. Its shaft spans six *chǐ*, fitted below with an iron spike and hook for suspending a satchel. Above, a medicine gourd and alchemical scriptures hang from the *ruyi*. This innovation began with me.\n\n**Sleeping Implements**\nSleeping implements are all made of fine cloth or silk.\n\nFor Daoist monastics, sleeping quilts must not be made of crimson, purple, azure, green, cloud-patterned silk, *yunbi* damask, brocade, embroidery, pearl-stitched trims, or appliquéd lace—such materials directly violate the precepts and must not be used.\n\n**Mats**\nMats serve to block the noxious *qi* of the earthly corpse. Their size may vary according to individual need. For mats used outdoors, simplicity and elegance suffice.\n\n**Felt**\nFelt is not proper attire for Daoist monastics. Since sheep’s wool carries the stench of impurity, it offends the perfected sages; great caution is warranted. When entering the altar to perform Daoist rites, felt must not be worn. Such are the strict regulations of the Daoist code.\n\n**Rain Gear**\nEveryday rain gear may be chosen at one’s discretion.\n\n**Quilts**\nQuilts should be made of fine, lightweight cloth, without stitched borders or decorative trims. Plainness is prized; extravagance is shunned.\n\n**Sheets**\nSheets—outer coverings—are to be made of fine, lightweight silk, without borders or excessive width.\n\n**Pillows**\nPillows are to be crafted from wood, either plain or lacquered, and shaped as perfect squares. No irregular or curved forms are permitted.\n\n**Wooden Clogs**\nThe design of wooden clogs embodies the seven *po* souls transformed into dragons and tigers, subdued beneath the soles. Daoist practitioners should wear clogs or ceremonial shoes during worship. For casual movement, clogs allow the seven *po* souls to find repose.\n\n**Clogs**\nAll who receive the Sevenfold Precepts carry the black *qi* of the three *hun* and five spirits within their robes and headscarves, while the seven *po* and nine numinous spirits dwell beneath their clogs. Thus, advanced Daoists must never allow others to handle their clogs, nor touch their headscarves or robes—this is the reason.\n\n**Indoor Slippers**\nIndoor slippers are worn only in bathing chambers for washing the feet; they must not be worn elsewhere.\n\n**Clog Racks**\nSince dragons and tigers—divine spirits—lie beneath all clogs, at night they should be placed upon a wooden rack or peachwood stand, never carelessly set on the ground. Daoist practitioners must treat their ritual crowns, clogs, and robes with reverence, never discarding them lightly.\n\n**Clothing Fumigators**\nClothing should always be perfumed, ensuring it remains fragrant and immaculate, so that when one ascends the altar to perform rites, one’s presence harmonizes with the Dao.\n\n**Beds**\nFor sitting or reclining, beds should have four legs, each eight *chǐ* in length, forming a perfect square, and stand at least three *chǐ* high to sever earthly *qi* and malevolent influences. No carvings or embellishments are permitted. Another tradition speaks of the \"Purple Jade Couch of the Three Pristine Ones,\" a jade bed elevated three *chǐ* above the ground. This height is necessary because the noxious *qi* of the earthly corpse and the five toxins rise a *chǐ* from the ground; without such elevation, the body becomes clouded, the mind’s devotion falters, and communion with the perfected sages is obstructed. Beds are among the most essential furnishings, and their design should prioritize height, brightness, and purity.\n\n**Rope Beds**\nRope beds, or curved benches, are ideal for breathwork and guiding *qi*, offering stability and comfort—an invention of earlier sages. The traditional design, adorned with purple and crimson silk cords and crafted from white sandalwood, is particularly refined. Such is the lofty and pure ethos of the Daoist tradition.\n\n**Mats**\nMats should be made of newly woven material. There are many types of mats, each suited to what is available at the time—reeds, rushes, and the like—all must be clean and fresh. Whether coarse or fine, they may be used as one sees fit.\n\n**Comb Boxes**\nHair is the image of the stars and constellations. It is also called the \"dark cloud canopy\" and the \"remnant of blood.\" Some say hair is the \"jeweled forest of the Purple Palace,\" the dwelling place of the brain spirit, and thus must be combed and tended with method. Daoists therefore keep a comb box to store their combs.\n\n**Combs**\nCombs, with their widely spaced teeth, are essential tools for arranging the hair and promoting the circulation of blood. They must never be neglected for even a moment. Whether young or old, one should comb the hair from beginning to end each day—this is the way to prolong life.\n\n**Fine-Toothed Combs**\nFine-toothed combs, with their closely set teeth, are used to remove filth from the head. They should be made of boxwood, oak, or golden wattle. For those who follow the Dao, materials such as bone, horn, ivory, or tortoiseshell are unsuitable.\n\n**Tweezers**\nThe nose is the Gate of Heaven, the passage through which *qi* enters and exits. It should always be kept open to allow the free flow of *qi*, so that the spirit may flourish. Tweezers, made of copper or iron, are used to pluck the hairs from the nose.\n\n**Brushes**\nBrushes are used to remove the grease and grime from combs and fine-toothed combs. Those made of palm fiber or *Miscanthus* roots are best.\n\n**Ear Spoons**\nThe ears are the gates of the *hun* and the doors of the *po*. Keeping them clean ensures that the *hun* and *po* remain with the body. The ears are the remnant of skin, and ear spoons—made of gold, silver, copper, iron, bamboo, or ivory—are used to remove the filth from them.\n\n**Nail Clippers**\nThe gods of the celestial chariot’s guards reside at the tips of the fingernails. Nails are the remnant of sinew, and Daoists clip them on auspicious days to subdue the Three Corpses, preventing the rise of filth and evil. Thus, one must keep a nail clipper for trimming the nails.\n\n**Nail Pouches**\nThe *Shangqing* scriptures forbid the burning of nails and hair. The *Bowuzhi* states: \"The owl gathers people’s nails at night and places them in its eyes to divine the fortune of gold.\" The *Qianjin Fang* also says: \"Nails that enter the abdomen cause illness, which cannot be cured.\" According to the *Lingshu Jing*, burning nails and hair is among the ten defeats. Some say that ghosts who obtain a person’s nails and hair can bind the three *hun*, leading to nightmares and demonic possession. For these reasons, a nail pouch is indispensable.\n\n**Hair Pouches**\nThe body, hair, and skin must not be harmed. When combing, loose hair should be gathered and stored in a pouch. If there is much, it should be arranged neatly—never carelessly discarded, as this has been forbidden since ancient times. Those who cultivate the Dao must take heed.\n\n**Fine-Toothed Combs (for Ritual Use)**\nBefore ascending the altar or entering meditation, one must wash the hands and feet, arrange the hair, and then pay homage. First, a fine-toothed comb is used to smooth the hair before washing. They may be made of ivory, bamboo, or wood, as appropriate.\n\n**Soap Bean Pouches**\nThere are many methods for removing grease, but for bathing, none surpasses black soybean flour. It should be sewn into a pouch or stored in a box for washing.\n\n**Salt Boxes**\nTeeth are the remnant of bone. The mouth and teeth must be regularly cleansed so that all yang energies gather at the head, circulating through the mouth and teeth, thereby naturally connecting with the divine perfected. Moreover, salt congeals the blood, dispels wind, and strengthens the teeth. Thus, it is best to store powdered salt and use it to scrub the teeth frequently.\n\n**Towels**\nWhen combing the hair, one towel should be placed on the knees, and another used to wipe the hands and face.\n\nScholars of the Dao must regularly cleanse their mouths and teeth, trim their nails and hair, and purify themselves with incense, so that divine spirits may descend and their thoughts may resonate with the celestial. **Deer-Hide Pouches** are used to store medicinal substances; wandering ascetics who roam like clouds and water employ them, for nothing but deer hide is suitable.\n\n**Water Filters**\nAll water used by Daoists must first be strained before use. These are made of fine silk or gauze. If the material is too coarse, small creatures may slip through, inadvertently harming life.\n\n**Tripods**\nThe design of tripods need not be elaborated here, for their details are fully recorded in alchemical texts. Those who study the Dao must first master them; there is no need to repeat them here.\n\n**Cauldrons**\nIn antiquity, there were names such as *golden cauldron*, *Nine Tripods*, and *elixir cauldron*—all used by Daoists for refining elixirs.\n\n**Basins**\nDaoist immortals prefer those made of fired clay.\n\n**Jars**\nThese are the same as those used in common households, but they must be kept clean and free from meat, fish, grease, and oil.\n\n**Steamers**\nThere are names such as *golden cauldron and jade steamer* among those who cultivate immortality. The *Erya* states: \"A steamer is called a *yan*.\" It is also known simply as a *zeng*. In the capital and Luoyang, they are made of pottery—essentially basins without bottoms. In Jianghuai and the Wu-Chu regions, they are made of wood, while in Lingbiao, some are fashioned from large bamboo fungi, used for steaming medicinal substances. Such implements are indispensable in Daoist practice.\n\n**Vases**\nThe Daoist scriptures speak of *Jade Capital and Golden Vases*. In the capital and Luoyang, smaller jars are called *vases*. *Vase* is another name for *jar* or *urn*, and its use among people is especially indispensable.\n\n**Trays**\nModern trays are generally large and square, with tooth-like feet called *tooth trays*. These are stable and convenient for offerings. Large round trays with feet are also excellent. Their surfaces are often adorned with painted clouds, coiling dragons, dancing phoenixes, white cranes, and soaring luan birds.\n\n**Offering Boxes**\nIn contemporary usage, those carried in the hands are called *qing*, while those with lids that fit over one another are called *boxes*. Both serve as offering vessels before the Heavenly Worthies, and their varieties are numerous.\n\n**Pouring Bowls**\nWherever Daoist adepts or female immortals reside, they must first prepare washing basins and pouring bowls, or vessels to hold clean water. In all actions and movements, they must rinse their mouths and wash their hands. These vessels may be made of gold, silver, bronze, or pottery, according to what is available, but they must always have lids to prevent wind, dust, insects, or impurities from contaminating them. Such purity far surpasses that of ordinary vessels.\n\n**Spittoons**\nWhen ascending the altar or entering the meditation chamber, one must rinse the mouth with clean water and spit into a bowl or tray, never onto the ground. For to serve Heaven is like serving a sovereign, and to serve one’s master is like serving the divine. Before scriptures and images, one must not spit, rinse the mouth, or raise one’s voice loudly, but always conduct oneself as if in the presence of a wise ruler. If even serving one’s master demands such reverence, how much more so before scriptures and images! When ascending the altar or entering stillness, one should not perform ablutions in a hasty or unclean manner; spittoons should be kept nearby for convenience.\n\n**Feeding Trays for Sentient Beings**\nBy ancient custom, a tray or platform for sentient beings is placed before the refectory. After each meal, the food that remains is collected by an attendant and then scattered outside. This serves four purposes: first, to offer to the ancestors; second, to present to the earth spirits; third, to sever evil influences—for if this food is not offered, malevolent spirits will vie to invade, poisoning the human body; and fourth, to cultivate compassion, pitying all sentient beings and wishing that they, too, may partake of the Dharma’s flavor and be universally sated. Hence, it is called the *Feeding Tray for Sentient Beings*. Such trays have existed since the time of Zheng Siyuan, Ge Hong, and other masters. They are indispensable even today.\n\n**Bamboo Utensils**\n\n**□** (pronounced *xuàn* in the departing tone): A bamboo vessel, round and shallow. In the Jiang-Huai region, it is used for winnowing and sifting rice and wheat, and is also called a *winnowing basket*. Such implements are indispensable in Daoist mountain retreats.\n\n**Winnowing Basket**: In the Jing-Luo region, these are made of willow, rounded at the back with a hook and square at the front with a flared edge, used for sorting rice and wheat. When the belly is deepened and woven tightly from bamboo, with a broad base and ample depth, the larger ones are called *pángjī*. The people of Chu call them *shāojī*, essential for steaming and cooking, also known as *cuōjī*.\n\n**Brooms**: All halls and temples are swept with fine brooms; no others may be used indiscriminately. Immortals’ households employ brooms made of qilin fur or phoenix feathers, depending on what is available. The most esteemed are made of dragon’s whiskers. In Jiang-Huai, broomcorn millet flowers are commonly used, while in Jing-Luo, broomcorn seedlings are preferred—each following what the land yields. However, for sweeping the main hall, only the finest and smoothest brooms are deemed suitable. Coarser brooms may be used for other temple spaces, but those designated for the main hall must never be employed elsewhere.\n\n**Strainers**: In modern usage, these serve as brush holders. They are also used for sifting medicinal herbs, rice, wheat, and other necessities in mountain retreats.\n\n**□** (pronounced *yù*): In ancient times, this was called *lèyù*, a bamboo vessel shaped like a spiral shell, holding two or three *dou*, used for rinsing rice. Such utensils are indispensable in places where Daoists cultivate the true Way.\n\n**Ritual Vessels**\n\nFor all offerings before the Heavenly Worthies during fasts and jiao rites, seasonal flowers and fruits are presented to express utmost devotion. The vessels used must be pure and clean—no defiled, impure, or improper implements may be placed among the ritual offerings. As the *Zhen’gao* states: \"When Daoists receive food during a fast, no unworthy person may handle it. Violation invites the punishment of corpse-infestation and spectral torment, as hungry ghosts assail the spirit.\" This is why ritual vessels are specially designated.\n\nFrom *The Jade Pivot’s Numinous Writings* and *Discerning the Dao of Immortals*:\n\nThe Southern Pole Elder asked the Ageless Master: \"Confucians dismiss the notion of immortals as absurd and fantastical, unworthy of discussion. All things under heaven and earth follow the same pattern: flourishing must yield to withering, completion to decay, life to death. How can it be claimed that immortals escape death, matching heaven and earth in longevity? Is this not delusion? To achieve the Dao and ascend in a sudden leap, entering the celestial palaces and joining the ranks of the Perfected—is this not deception? It is like grasping at wind without shadow, seizing reflections impossible to hold, pursuing what cannot exist, and treading paths that cannot be walked. Is this not futile? You are a student of immortality—you must know the truth. Defend it for me.\"\n\nThe Ageless Master replied: \"I have heard that among grasses and trees, all sprout in spring and wither in winter—yet the pine and cypress alone remain evergreen. Among birds and beasts, all are born and must die—yet the tortoise and crane alone enjoy long years. If even plants and animals exhibit such exceptions, how much more should humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings?\n\nConsider further: water is inherently cool, yet in Warm Valley, boiling springs emerge; fire is inherently hot, yet on Xiao Mound, cold flames arise. Stone is a heavy substance, yet in the Southern Sea, floating stones grow; feathers are light, yet in the Eastern Sea, Weak Waters sink them. These are the principles by which heaven and earth generate things—some defy the ordinary.\n\nAgain, pheasants transform into clams, sparrows into mussels; earthworms sprout wings, river frogs take flight; water beetles become clams, duckweed decays into maggots; field mice turn into waterfowl, rotting grass into fireflies; Niu Ai became a tiger, the woman of Chu a dragon; turtles transform into tigers, snakes into dragons; mulberry branches become willows, wheat into butterflies; maples take human form, the maiden of Qin turns to stone. These all partake of heaven and earth’s numinous marvels—beyond mortal comprehension, even sages struggle to explain. Such are the wondrous workings of heaven and earth, the principles of transformation.\n\nHow much more so for humans, who are endowed with the essence of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, and the three luminaries? Those who attain the Dao surpass even the insentient grasses and trees!\n\nFor example, when sweetened bait is laced with medicine and placed in a fish’s mouth, then boiled in a pot, the unmedicated fish are cooked and eaten, while the medicated one swims in the pot all day as if in a river or sea. When mulberry leaves are dusted with longevity medicine and fed to silkworms, they live for years without aging. When age-arresting medicine is given to newly hatched chicks or puppies, they never grow. When white-restoring medicine is fed to a white dog, its fur turns black within a hundred days. These are the wonders of medicine—how could ordinary people obtain such formulas? This demonstrates the proven efficacy of elixirs in attaining longevity.\n\nConsider also the Yellow Emperor, who refined the Nine Cauldrons on Mount Xing. When the elixir was complete, a yellow dragon descended with flowing whiskers to receive him. The Emperor ascended with eighty-one women, and seventy-one officials clung to the dragon’s whiskers and the Emperor’s bow, rising with him. Today, among the stellar lodges, the seventeen stars of Xuanyuan remain. Gonggong’s minister, Gou Long, who had erred, attained the Dao and ascended to the Southern Pole—now, near the Well and Bow lodges, the single star of the Old Man shines. Chuanxu, minister to Tang, attained the Dao and rode the Tail and Winnowing Basket lodges to become a constellation—today, near the Tail lodge, the star of Chuanxu appears, and near the Woman lodge, the four stars of Xi Zhong. Wang Liang and Zaofu, master charioteers of Zhou, attained the Dao and became stellar ranks—Wang Liang’s five stars array near the Straddler lodge, Zaofu’s five stars near the Rooftop lodge. These are all recorded in celestial texts, visible in the night sky, as clear as the sun and moon, seen by ten thousand eyes, pointed to by ten thousand fingers. How can there be no immortals?\n\nMoreover, consider the principle of transformation: In the Xia dynasty, a woman in the palace transformed into a dragon, then back into a woman. In the Shang, a woman became a man. In the time of King Jing of Zhou, a woman became a man. During the Jianping era of Emperor Ai of Han, a man became a woman, married a husband, and bore a child. During the Jian’an era of Emperor Xian of Han, a man became a woman. These are all instances of transformation.\n\nDuring the Taihe era of Emperor Ming of Wei, a man in Taiyuan opened an ancient tomb and found a woman in the coffin, still alive at thirty. She was brought out, married, and bore a child. During the Xianning era of Emperor Wu of Jin, Yan Ji of Langye died, but a year later, his voice was heard. When the coffin was opened, he appeared alive. During the Yuankang era of Emperor Hui of Jin, a woman from Liang state was betrothed to a man who was conscripted to the frontier. After a year without his return, her family remarried her, but she died of sorrow and was buried. Years later, her husband returned, opened her tomb, and she revived. He took her as his wife. These are all instances of death followed by rebirth. If the dead can return to life, how much more can the living, who possess the marvels of creation, attain immortality? These accounts are all found in the classics, clearly verifiable.\n\nNow, consider animals: the tortoise lives a thousand years, its shell displaying five colors, with two horn-like bones rising from its forehead. It understands human speech and floats upon lotus leaves.\"\n\nThe thousand-year crane is pure white in color, its brain entirely transformed into cinnabar. It can perch upon trees, while those not yet a thousand years old do not alight on them. The macaque lives eight hundred years, then transforms into an ape; the ape, after five hundred years, becomes a *jue*; the *jue* lives a thousand years without dying. The toad lives three thousand years, as do the *tenghuang* and *jiguang*. The qilin lives two thousand years, while deer and hares live a thousand; when they reach five hundred, their fur turns white. Foxes and wolves live eight hundred years; at five hundred, they gain the ability to transform into humans. The rat lives three hundred years; at a hundred, it turns white and becomes adept at divining by leaning upon people, known as the *zhong*. It can foretell the fortune of the year’s end and events a thousand *li* away. The snake possesses boundless longevity, and all creatures with human faces and avian bodies live ten thousand years. These are all beasts and birds that have received the numinous *qi* of Heaven and Earth, yet they can live for thousands or tens of thousands of years without dying. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings—could they not attain immortality? These accounts are all recorded in the annals, clearly verifiable. From this alone, the existence of divine transcendents is evident.\n\nThe elder said: “From ancient times until now, I have never heard such words.” Upon hearing your explanation, my doubts are dispelled.\n\n**The Rarity of Encountering the Dao**\nAs stated in the *Zhen’gao*: For a being to escape the three evil destinies and be born as a human is rare. Having been born human, to be male rather than female is rare. Being male, to possess all six senses and four limbs intact is rare. With senses and limbs complete, to be born in the Central Kingdom is rare. Born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter parents and a ruler who favor the Dao is rare. Having met a Dao-favoring ruler, to be born into a Dao-favoring family with a kind and benevolent heart is rare. With a benevolent heart awakened, to believe in the Dao and the attainment of long life is rare. Having believed in the Dao and long life, to encounter the *renchen* era of Great Peace is the rarest of all. How can one not strive with diligence?\n\n**On Karmic Conditions**\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Gujing* states: Those whose past lives originated among barbarians or were reborn from the karmic retribution of beasts cannot hear the supreme Dao. Those who in past lives did not plant good roots or accumulate meritorious deeds—even if they encounter the true Dao in this life—will find cultivation difficult and loss easy. For their karmic affinity is shallow, shifting with circumstances, and few achieve success. Those who cultivate the supreme, most wondrous Dao of the Perfected do so because of past-life merit, hidden acts of virtue, kindness to others, and rescue from hardship. Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits naturally assist and support them, allowing them to meet true adepts and attain realization with ease. Thus, while the Dao may be divided into the orthodox and the heterodox, encountering it is not difficult—preserving it is the true challenge.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: “It is easy for humans to seek the Dao, but difficult for the Dao to seek humans”—meaning it is not transmitted to the unworthy. Later seekers of the Dao, though devoted, must guard against the seductions of heretical teachings and heterodox paths. If the heart is not single-minded, one drifts far from the Dao. How can one not be cautious and thorough in this pursuit?\n\n**On Innate Dispositions**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: If one’s fate is governed by the Star of Life, that person will inevitably favor the Dao of transcendence. Those who favor the Dao will surely attain it. If one’s fate is governed by the Star of Death, that person will not believe in the Dao of transcendence and will not cultivate its practices. Whether one delights in goodness or not is determined by one’s endowment. To alter or deprive this is beyond even Heaven’s power—like metal and stone melted in a furnace or clay vessels shaped in a kiln: though their forms are molded by these means, the sharpness of bronze and iron or the integrity of jars and porcelain depend on what they encounter, not the furnace or kiln that shaped them.\n\n**The Dao’s Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy**\nBefore Heaven and Earth were separated, the Dao stood alongside them, giving rise to the myriad things and enduring for ten thousand ages without cease. All that humankind employs in daily life is the Dao. Thus it is said: “Heaven gives birth to the multitudes.” And again: “Only Heaven, in its hidden virtue, watches over the people.” Therefore, it establishes the true Dao. The Yellow Emperor proclaimed it, and from the eras of Yao, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu to the times of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, all rulers upheld the Dao of Heaven, rectified human relations, maintained the rites of ruler and minister, the affection of father and son, and the principles of the Three Bonds. This is the Dao of the sage-kings of the Central Kingdom—what is called the orthodox Dao. It was not exclusive to the ages of Yao, Shun, the Zhou, or Confucius. Confucius said: “To seek the obscure and practice the strange—if later generations were to transmit such things, I would not do so.” When heterodox teachings arise, the great principles are obscured—hence, they are called “heretical.”\n\n**Monk Yi’an Questions the Dao**\nIn the first year of the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, the monk Yi’an asked Tao Kan: “In the world, many follow Buddhism, while few follow the Dao. Why is this?” Tao Kan replied: “The qilin and phoenix do not appear easily; the *moling* and *jia* do not grow often. All things that are rare are precious, while those that are common are base. Among humans, the worthy are always few, and the foolish are always many. The Dao’s teachings lie beyond the five phases and the refining of the furnace. Those who attain it ascend in broad daylight, transcending Heaven and Earth to exist alone, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay. Thus, its teachings are profound and abstruse, difficult for the foolish to learn. It is not transmitted to the unworthy, so its followers are always few. As for your teachings, they are merely a single topic—through twenty or thirty, or even forty or fifty years of quiet meditation, one may suddenly awaken, calling it ‘shattering the mass of doubt.’ For the body of form is an illusion, and the greatest joy lies in quiescent extinction. The highest goal is to avoid rebirth in the human realm, attaining the fruit of the Arhat, known as the ‘fruit of no return.’ Though its methods are accessible even to the most foolish and lowly, anyone can practice them—thus, its followers are always many.”\n\nYi’an said: “This is truly a sound argument.” He then abandoned the monastic life to study the Dao, changing his name to Du Shoujing.\n\nThis discourse presents a most reasoned argument, and thus it is recorded here.\n\n*Gou Geng’s Alchemical Trickery*\nThe *Supreme Elixir Furnace and Tongs* states: “Gou Geng’s method of ‘transmuting straw’—whereby mercury is contracted into base metal—is no different from theft. Not only does it harm oneself, but it harms others even more severely. Thus, it is rightly called ‘the thief’s art,’ and the condemnation is most apt.\n\nYet some still practice it, willingly embracing the role of thief. Wealth gained through deceit will depart through deceit. I have seen such men squander their entire future, ending their lives in deeper ruin.\n\nWhen Immortal Ge first began his alchemical studies, he was once taught the method of ‘transmuting straw’—using reagents to refine copper until it turned not only white but also soft and pliable. Later, he observed a Daoist adept crafting drinking vessels from this metal. On the base of each, he had inscribed the words ‘unfit for pawning or sale.’ A guest asked the reason, and the adept replied: ‘This is *straw-silver*. Though my household is poor and I lack proper utensils, I use these as a temporary substitute. But I fear thieves might pawn or sell them, so I mark them to prevent others from falling into ruin.’\n\nIn his later years, the Immortal destroyed all such vessels.”\n\nLater practitioners of refinement must all prohibit and abolish such practices.\n\nAccording to records from the second year of Jingyou in the Song dynasty under Emperor Renzong, the monk Fuqing of Bozhou submitted a memorial: “The disciples of my monastic order have abandoned the ancestral teachings and violated the fundamental precepts of our school. All aspire to the Dao of long life and enduring vision, hoping to ascend to the celestial palaces. They transmit the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and though they retain the name of ‘sitting in meditation,’ they have lost the essence of contemplating the mind and investigating nature. Internally, they secretly adopt the Daoist methods of refining lead and mercury within the body to seek longevity; externally, they practice the arts of ‘green, yellow, and white’ alchemy, coveting wealth and profit. Examining their conduct, it is all nothing more than ‘transmuting straw,’ ‘coagulating mercury,’ and ‘condensing goods’—forging false gold and silver to deceive the world and acquire wealth. This is no different from banditry. They fear neither heavenly retribution, nor royal law, nor divine punishment. How can this be the conduct of those who have left the household life to cultivate the Way?\n\nThe practice of the elixir path is inherently the domain of Daoist adepts, as it should be. Yet Daoists, knowing the strict prohibitions and celestial statutes governing alchemical scriptures, dare not engage in such practices. Only we monks secretly pursue them, harboring malicious intent to harm the world. Many have been ruined, their families broken and fortunes lost. As the earlier Confucians said, ‘The treasured teachings of the Daoists have all been stolen by the Buddhists’—this is precisely what they meant. All such practices must be prohibited and abolished.”\n\nThe emperor then issued an edict: “If any Daoist dares to entice monks for their wealth and transmit Daoist methods, or if any monk dares to abandon the ancestral teachings, secretly practice Daoist arts, privately forge false gold and silver, engage in ‘transmuting straw,’ ‘coagulating mercury,’ or ‘condensing goods,’ they shall all be exiled to the frontier garrison of Liaoxi to defend against the Khitan.” From this point onward, the transmission of the elixir path to the unworthy ceased.\n\n**On Corpse Liberation**\nWhen a person dies, one must examine their form. If it resembles that of a living person, this is *corpse liberation*. If the feet are not discolored and the skin is unwrinkled, this is also *corpse liberation*. Essentially, if the eyes remain unspoiled and indistinguishable from those of a living person, this is *corpse liberation*. If the hair has fallen out entirely and the bones have lost their form, this too is *corpse liberation*. However, *corpse liberation in broad daylight* is the mark of a transcendent—it does not fall under the category of ordinary *corpse liberation*.\n\n**The Land of Fangzhu**\nAccording to the *True Reports*: Beyond the Eastern Sea, there is a land where the Dao of long life is cultivated, called Fangzhu. Its people regard immortality as the Way and undying as joy. The land of Fangzhu is square, each side measuring 1,300 *li*, totaling 5,200 *li* in perimeter—hence its name. Its height reaches 9,000 *zhang*. There stands the Ever-Bright Great Mountain, and the Night Moon High Mound, each encircling 400 *li*. The land is lush with grasses and trees, bearing flowers and fruits. There grows the *immortal grass*, crimson and radiant, never withering, evergreen for ten thousand years. Those who eat it do not die. There are also sweet spring waters found everywhere; drinking them also confers immortality, and all who dwell there enjoy long life.\n\nIn this land resides the Lord of the Blue Emperor, whose palace lies atop the Eastern Florescence Mountain, spanning 200 *li*. Within it dwell celestial transcendent beings, and the palaces of the highest perfected ones are built there, their halls and chambers constructed of interwoven gold, jade, and *juyao* stones. There is also the Dark Cold Mountain, where the outer officials reside, their palaces encircling 200 *li*.\n\nTo the east and west of central Fangzhu lie the lesser Fangzhu lands, each 3,000 *li* distant from the greater Fangzhu. These lesser lands are also square, each side measuring 300 *li*, with a perimeter of 1,200 *li*. Each has its own palace of the Lord of the Blue Emperor, where celestial perfected beings reside.\n\nIt is said that these lands have existed since the beginning of creation, though none know their age. The mountains produce spirit birds and spirit beasts, none of which are known by name. The greater Fangzhu lies southeast of Kuaiji, 70,000 *li* distant. To the northeast, one finds the Scalding Valley and the Land of the Fusang Tree, another 60,000 *li* beyond Fangzhu.\n\nIn the land of the western lesser Fangzhu, many follow the Buddhist path. They erect pagodas carved from gold and jade, some rising hundreds of *chi* in layered towers. The people there are exceedingly filial and do not die, a result of consuming the *immortal grass*. They all ingest the essences of the Five Stars and the radiance of the sun and moon—by day, the light of the sun, and by night, the brilliance of the moon. They study the *Returning to the Hidden* of the Xia dynasty and use it to achieve flight.\n\nIn the eastern lesser Fangzhu, rare treasures abound, wondrous and numinous. There are jade wine and golden nectar. The Lord of the Blue Emperor stores celestial treasures here, and many transcendent beings dwell in this land. They eat the *immortal grass* and drink this wine and nectar, their bodies taking on the hue of gold and jade. Often, they play the *Nine Spirit Flutes* for their own amusement. The sound of a skilled flutist carries for forty *li*. The flutes have thirty holes, the bamboo measuring two to three *chi* in length. When nine flutes play in unison, the hundred beasts dance in joy, and phoenixes gather in flocks, their cries and dances harmonizing with the flute music—this is the music of that land, vastly different from the Buddhist practices of the Western Hu.\n\nThe Western Hu’s method involves blowing great conch horns and striking great dharma drums, their music unlike that of Fangzhu, and their teachings even more so. The *Nirvana Sutra* states: “Birth and extinction are extinguished; quiescence is joy.” Thus, they regard life as illusion and death as joy. The people of Fangzhu, however, regard life as joy and death as calamity. Therefore, they speak of *Buddhist teachings* but not of *Buddhist Dao*.\n\n**From the *True Reports***\nAccording to the *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*: Beyond the Eastern Sea lies Floating Swan Mountain. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, the mountain drifted to the eastern sea of Zhejiang. Upon it dwelled over three hundred female transcendent beings, each three to four hundred years old, along with two masters, each a thousand years old. The mountain produced vermilion grass, which they wove into mats and presented to the emperor. They said that within the grass dwelled red birds, which the emperor ordered to be painted—these were revealed to be vermilion phoenixes. After ten days, the mountain floated away again.\n\nThe *barbarians* revere the Dao.\n\nThe state of Joseon, since King Wu enfeoffed Jizi there, retained the rites, music, institutions, attire, culture, medicine, shamanism, divination, and augury of the Central Kingdom. As the saying goes among the Zhou people, \"Half of the ten thousand Shang merchants crossed the Liao River\"—this refers to the five thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight Chinese who accompanied Jizi to that land. To this day, its rites, music, institutions, *Classic of Poetry*, and cultural artifacts endure, preserving much of the Central Kingdom’s legacy. It cannot be spoken of in the same breath as the *barbarian* states.\n\nAlas, the secrets of the Heavenly Dao were not transmitted to lands of foreign tongues, and thus it lacks Daoist teachings.\n\nAccording to the *Mirror of the Dao*: There was a man of Silla named Kim Gakgi, who was ashamed of his country’s coarse language and *barbarian* customs. He entered the Central Kingdom to study its speech and the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for twenty-four years. Suddenly, he encountered an extraordinary person who bestowed upon him the essential secrets of the Heavenly Heart and the Dao of ascension and transformation. Thereupon, he devoted himself to the wondrous Dao, reciting the various scriptures of Daoist transcendents without cease for nine years. The Heavenly Emperor conferred upon him a sacred mandate, and he concealed himself in Mount Zhongnan. In the eleventh year of the Dazhong era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, on the fifteenth day of the second month, he submitted a memorial to the court, stating: \"Your servant has received a decree from the Jade Emperor to ascend as Attendant of the Yingwen Terrace. Next year, on the fifteenth day of the second month, your servant shall ascend to Heaven.\" The emperor marveled at this and dispatched a court attendant to observe. On the day of his ascension, tens of thousands of residents gathered to witness, all hearing the voices of divine beings in the sky, who declared:\n\n\"The King of Silla upholds benevolence and gentleness, never bullying the weak or seizing the lands of neighboring states. He harbors no deceit toward great nations, nor does he obstruct tribute to the Central Kingdom. He does not favor warfare or the slaughter of living beings. Kim Gakgi is a clansman of the King of Silla. By decree of the Supreme Emperor, he shall ascend in broad daylight as Attendant of the Yingwen Terrace.\"\n\nThe states of Silla, Joseon, Tamna, and Baekje, all along the eastern shores of the sea, each have kings to govern them, all under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Florescence Emperor Lord. Any powerful state that seizes their lands to make them subordinate prefectures, obstructs tribute to the Central Kingdom for its own gain, or favors warfare and the slaughter of living beings shall, after death, suffer in the Nine Dark Realms, their bodies tormented by wind and blades, condemned for ten thousand kalpas without pardon. Those who invade others’ lands shall have their descendants struck by premature misfortune, and upon death, their souls shall become dogs in those lands, passing through the executioner’s block to repay their debts for a hundred generations. Aside from the retribution exacted by the mountain and river spirits of the various states, there is no absolution. Only the people of Silla, who have rendered service to the world, may ascend to the heavenly courts.\n\nAs the words faded, suddenly the air resounded with the music of flutes and drums, and phoenixes and cranes danced in flight. Banners and canopies descended from the sky to welcome him, and he ascended to Heaven. From this, it is evident that Silla, Joseon, Baekje, and Tamna, all along the eastern shores of the sea, receive the pure and numinous *qi* of Heaven and Earth and are thus capable of cultivating the Dao—this is the proof.\n\nMaster Huangfu said: \"Along the eastern shores of the sea, the eight states of Goguryeo, Tamna, Silla, and Baekje have lands and springs connected to the geomantic veins of Penglai. Their people are all capable of cultivating the Dao, and those who study it may attain longevity and enduring vision. Alas, they have forsaken the land of the East’s vital *qi* and the fount of immortality, instead embracing the Western teachings of metal’s stern, desolate, and extinguishing *qi*, regarding death as joy and life as illusion. Due to metal overcoming wood, they have lost the true immortal Dao and cannot attain longevity or enduring vision. Only Kim Gakgi of Silla understood that the Eastern lands possess the *qi* of immortals, belonging to spring and water, the realm of Heaven and Earth’s generation, the direction from which the sun rises—all places where the Dao may be cultivated. Thus, he entered the Central Kingdom to seek a master and inquire into the Dao, and ultimately ascended in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe Azure Cloud Elder said: \"The *barbarian* states are meager in fortune, and their people, having no prior cultivation or merit, possess shallow karmic roots and cannot be born in the Central Kingdom. Thus, their languages are unintelligible, and their Dao cannot be conveyed through written or spoken words. It is transmitted only mouth to mouth, heart to heart, requiring the heart to merge with the wondrous and the Dao to harmonize. Because their languages are unintelligible, it cannot be transmitted.\"\n\n**The Uighur Teachings**\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Uighur Möngke Temür’s Teachings*, translated into Chinese as the *Heavenly Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao’s Journey to the Western Regions to Convert the Barbarians and Attain the Dao*, it states: \"The Dao of the filial son lies in loyalty and filial piety. Once one understands loyalty and filial piety, one must know whence the body comes—it is the legacy of one’s parents, forming the child’s body. Having this body, one must understand the principles of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one must fulfill the duties of a subject, never daring to defy the Heavenly Dao. The great Dao is singular, governing the transformations of the One Origin, and is the lord of Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, stars, and the myriad things. Vast and boundless, most honored and noble, it is the limitless and unparalleled Dao, encompassing all phenomena. The myriad teachings and thousand schools all emerge from it, making it the mother of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. As for humanity, it is born of Heaven and treads upon Heaven’s path, knowing only one Heaven. Thus, they revere Heaven as their teaching.\"\n\nA gatha says:\nThere is a thing before Heaven and Earth,\nFormless, originally quiescent and empty,\nYet it is the lord of the myriad phenomena—\nThe Heavenly Dao is naturally luminous.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the teachings established by the Most High, even in *barbarian* lands and regions of foreign tongues, universally transform them with benevolence and instruct them in righteousness, as seen here. Thus, among the Uighur who cultivate this teaching, there are those who live for three hundred years—this is the proof. Therefore, the Uighur do not defy Heaven but uphold its teachings. Their teaching acknowledges only Heaven and no other gods. Each day at dawn and dusk, they face Heaven, calling out to it and seeking blessings. They touch it with their hands, stroke their faces, and press it to their chests, believing that Heaven bestows fortune upon them.\n\nThe Uighur’s teaching of revering Heaven is thus. In the *Discourse on Transforming the Barbarians* composed by Emperor Lizong of the Song, it is stated:\n\nI have examined the books of the Ru and Dao traditions that the Hu people sought to destroy. The Hu deeply resent the claim that Laozi transformed the barbarians, asserting that Laozi was born in the reign of King Ding, while the Buddha was born before Laozi’s departure through the pass, during the time of King Zhao—contradicting the records in Chinese Ru texts. Yet when I consult the Ru classics, the *Comprehensive Mirror* records that during the reign of King You, the Luo River ran dry, and Laozi lamented its desiccation, all of which is documented in the historical annals. King You was the ten-generations-removed ancestor of King Ding, predating him by a full ten reigns. How, then, could Laozi’s name have appeared earlier?\n\nFurthermore, the *Biography of Laozi* compiled by Liu Xiang of the Han states that Laozi served the Shang as the Keeper of Archives for the Lord of the West. The Ru classics also record: \"Lao Peng was a worthy minister of the Shang.\" Additionally, the scriptures of the Huihui consistently document the deeds of Laozi transforming the barbarians and attaining the Dao. From this, it can be conclusively argued that Laozi was born in the Shang.\n\nAt that time, the one who received the Mandate of Heaven to rule all under Heaven was called the Heavenly King. The Zhou, by virtue of King Wen’s power, were favored by August Heaven and encompassed the Four Seas as lords of the world. Their virtue and beneficence transformed all directions, so that none failed to submit. Thus, the myriad regions came to court, all bathed in the Son of Heaven’s power, for it was the reach of his grace that brought them. Laozi, as a minister of the Zhou Heavenly King, by the transformative power of the Son of Heaven’s virtue, departed westward through Hangu Pass and spread his teachings among the Qiang and the peoples of the west. All their governance and instruction originated from the Central Kingdom. As for those who speak of cultivating and studying the Dao, the very term *Dao* was established by Laozi. Since they speak of cultivating the Dao, it is undoubtedly Laozi’s transformation—could they not be Laozi’s disciples?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"Cultivating the Dao as a teaching.\" To speak of cultivating the Dao is to cultivate Laozi’s teaching. What further doubt remains?\n\nAs for the Buddha, his birth is attested in the *Wen Xuan*, compiled by Emperor Wu of Liang and his heir, Crown Prince Zhaoming. The text states: \"The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the omen of the night’s radiance\"—referring to the stars’ disappearance. \"The two Ming of Han and Jin together adorned the embellishments of cinnabar\"—referring to the rise of his teaching. It records that the Buddha was born in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, corresponding to the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu. His teaching first arrived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han and flourished in the time of Emperor Ming of Jin. Thus, it is said: \"Born in the two Zhuangs, flourished in the two Mings.\" This was Emperor Wu of Liang’s decree, recorded in the Ru classics as evidence for all under Heaven and all generations—a universal judgment that cannot be altered. Is this not the will of Heaven at work? Thus, the traces of China’s sages’ births and the matter of transforming the barbarians are aspects of the Heavenly Dao that cannot be erased!\n\nAlas, how arduous! Now, upon examining the teachings of Daoism and Buddhism, the origins of the *Scripture on Laozi’s Transformation of the Barbarians* began with Wang Fu. Initially ordained as a monk, his unparalleled intelligence aroused the envy of his fellow clerics, who attempted to poison him, but he survived. He then let his hair grow, donned the yellow cap, and rose to the rank of libationer. Due to his enmity with the Buddhist clergy, he altered the ancient version of the *Transformation of the Barbarians Scripture*, adding spurious claims. They mutually suppressed one another, shifting Laozi’s birth to the reign of King Ding and the Buddha’s birth to the time of King Zhao, placing it before Laozi’s western transformation and departure through the pass. From this, the origins of the *Scripture*’s fabrication were not of recent making.\n\nI contend that the matter of transforming the barbarians cannot be taken on faith. The books of the Daoist and Buddhist traditions must be verified against the Ru classics to discern who established the teachings and who was transformed by whom. The evidence is found in the *Comprehensive Geography: Barbarian Regions*, the *Wei略: Western Rong Chronicles*, the *Sui History: Western Regions Annals*, Pei Kai’s *Memorial to Emperor Huan of Han* and his annotated *Records of the Two States*, Cui Yuanshan’s *Lai Xiang Ji*, the biographies of Huangfu Mi and Ji Kang, Fan Ye’s *Book of Later Han*, Song Yun’s *Southern Yunnan Travelogue*, the *Veritable Records of Emperor Taizong of Tang*, the *Memorial of the Eight Scholars*, the eulogies of successive emperors, the prefaces of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Emperor Guangzong of Song—all of which are recorded in the Ru texts and corroborated by the Huihui scripture *Musa’lima*. The truth or falsity of these matters shines as brightly as the sun and stars; they cannot be concealed. This is the universal judgment of all under Heaven and all generations—clear as day.\n\nAlas, what more need I say? Comparing the teachings of the Buddha, they guide with compassion and love; the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, they guide with benevolence and righteousness; the teachings of Laozi, they guide with Dao and virtue, and expound loyalty and filial piety; the teachings of Confucius, they guide with ritual and music, and expound the fundamental norms. The essence of these three teachings in civilizing the world lies in nothing more than a single goodness—how can they be so envious of one another’s arts as to attack each other? Though the Yi and Xia differ, and customs vary, their pursuit of goodness is one and the same.\n\nBefore the Han dynasty, China knew only the two teachings of Ru and Dao. The Ru scholars even regarded Yang Zhu and Mo Di as heterodox and attacked them. By the Song dynasty, they also deemed the teachings of the Luo and Lian schools as \"false learning,\" for each established its own sect and did not follow the path of the former kings. Indeed, the sagely teachings must contain profound principles. Even among the disciples of Confucius, it was said that principles were not fully fathomed and knowledge was not exhausted—if even the sages were thus, how can mediocre scholars presume to comprehend? How can they envy others’ strengths, slander the Heavenly Emperor, disparage Confucius and Laozi, and harbor resentment? This is nothing but a path to chaos—is it not so?\n\n**Wu Cheng, Academician of the Yuan, Remonstrates Against Praying for Blessings in the Netherworld**\nAccording to the *Collected Works of Wu Caolu*, in brief: In the third year of Zhizhi of Emperor Yingzong, the transcription of the golden-script Buddhist sutras was completed. The emperor then commanded the Left Chancellor of the Secretariat, Susu, to issue an edict ordering Academician Wu Cheng to compose a preface for the sutras. The imperial decree stated: \"The transcription of the sutras is dedicated to three purposes: praying for blessings for the departed sagely emperors, seeking eternal mandate from Heaven for the ruler, and praying for the welfare of the people. A preface shall be written for these three matters.\"\n\nWu Cheng replied: \"Your Majesty’s intent in transcribing the sutras—for the state and the people—is a most noble act. However, as for praying for blessings in the netherworld, I remain ignorant of its efficacy. The Buddhist doctrine of cause and effect has never been misleading since ancient times, yet the foolish among the people delight in hearing it. Since the founding of this dynasty, how many times have sutras been transcribed for such prayers! If the deliverance proves ineffective, then the principle is nonexistent; if it proves effective, then it slanders one’s ancestors. To compose such words would be unworthy of posterity.\"\n\nThe Left Chancellor said: \"This is the emperor’s command. Sir, please await His Majesty’s return and present your case personally.\"\n\nWhen Emperor Yingzong arrived, Liulin was the Censor-in-Chief. Tie Shi assassinated the emperor in his traveling tent. Upon ascending the throne, Wu Cheng wept before the new emperor, saying: \"Praying for blessings led to swift self-destruction, dying at the hands of treacherous ministers—this was the fate of Emperor Wu of Liang and Emperor Xiang of Qi. The futility is evident. To pray for the deliverance of ancestors is to wish them rebirth in the Western Rong lands rather than in the Central Kingdom—truly a laughingstock for all generations.\" The emperor then commanded Daoist priests to perform the *Qishou* ritual for longevity, declaring: \"I, having inherited the accumulated virtue of my ancestors and the celestial mandate, have received the bright decree of Heaven to rule as lord of the Central Kingdom and possess the Four Seas. I wish to ascend with the people into the realm of longevity, sparing them from the calamity of premature death, and fulfilling the virtue of Heaven’s completion. The Lord on High cherishes life—may this prayer be granted.\"\n\nHe also established the *Jianzu* ritual for ancestral deliverance, declaring: \"I have heard that the human form is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Kingdom is rare. My ancestors were born in the northern deserts and received the mandate of Heaven. I was born in the Central Kingdom. Former sages all prayed for their ancestors’ rebirth in the Western Rong lands, but now, through my prayers, I wish the spirits of the Nine Temples to ascend to the celestial gates, not to be reborn in the Western Rong.\" Thereupon, he ordered that in every province, on festival days and the emperor’s birthday, Daoist priests should pray to Heaven to seek longevity for the Son of Heaven, blessings for the people, and the ascension of ancestors to Heaven. The rituals of *Jianba* (deliverance) and *Xishou* (prayer for longevity) were entrusted to Daoist recorder Hao Chongxiao for revision, and the new rites were disseminated throughout the land. Henceforth, all state rituals were to follow this principle.\n\n**Oral Instructions on Cultivating Immortality**\nWhen consuming medicinal substances, avoid garlic, pomegranate seeds, pig’s liver, and dog’s head meat. Complete abstention is the highest path for Daoist priests. One must not consume pork or dog meat while engaging in bedroom arts, for this nullifies the efficacy of the medicine. Each pound consumed diminishes one’s lifespan by a hundred days—beware! (Recorded by a disciple of Peng Zu.)\n\nWhen taking divine medicines, never face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit, lest one lose essence and qi, shortening one’s lifespan and rendering the medicine’s potency as dust. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\nDaoist priests seeking immortality must not consort with women. A single encounter drains a year’s medicinal efficacy. Even without consuming medicine, engaging in bedroom arts reduces one’s lifespan by thirty years. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Green Youth Lord**\nDaoist cultivators consuming food must avoid bloody substances. Eating them prevents the expulsion of the Three Corpses; only dried meat is permissible. (See Ge Hong’s *Inner Chapters*.)\n\n**Methods for Daoist Cultivators**\nWhen ill, close your eyes and inwardly visualize, using the fire of the heart to burn the body. Preserve the entire body, making the essence as if tangible—the illness will be cured. If pain persists, direct the fire to that spot, and it will surely take effect. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\nThose cultivating the Dao and seeking immortality must not look upon corpses, for it severely harms the spirit and disrupts qi. Only rulers, teachers, and beloved parents may be attended in death out of necessity. Thus, when Daoist priests pass away, they do not serve kings or nobles—this would be lacking in loyalty. To remain solitary and aloof is to lack companionship. Only for parents, teachers, and masters must one attend their funerals, enduring the utmost grief and risking harm to one’s life. If one is harmed by such sorrow, it is as if one had never been harmed at all. I keep this secret and transmit it orally.\n\nFrom *Accounts of Divine Immortals*:\n\nAll who study immortality must observe the taboo days: the ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the eleventh month. On these days, if one enters the chamber, one must not see women. Should the Six Corpses stir, the hidden blood will scatter and surge, the Three Hun souls lose their anchor, the spirit wither, and the qi depart—accumulating until death. The reason for avoiding these days is not merely to restrain reckless indulgence, but specifically to pacify the Palace of Women.\n\nThe Palace of Women resides in *shen* (the ninth earthly branch), while the Palace of Men resides in *yin* (the third earthly branch). *Yin* and *shen* clash, and their mutual punishment brings harm. On these days, the male and female Three Corpses emerge from the red pupils of the eyes—the female corpse beckons the male, the male corpse beckons the female. Disaster and misfortune come and go, depleting the spirit and diminishing life. Though one may not perceive it, the body’s form is already damaged, for the Three Corpses wage war within the eyes, and blood flows into the Mud Pill Palace.\n\nEven if a woman is most beloved or a wife most cherished, one must resolutely avoid facing her on these days. The former masters attained immortality solely by observing this practice.\n\nEven kinfolk are not exempt—those without intent are no exception. You must be vigilant.\n\nAll Daoist practitioners, when sleeping at night, should lie on their side, visualizing the Dipper covering their body. When seated, they should envision the sun within the Mud Pill Palace and the moon at the navel. Before sleep, they must clasp their hands in the Double Thunder Seal, hold their breath, and contract the lower body nine times, as if restraining the urge to relieve themselves, before drifting off. Upon waking, they should repeat this practice, bending their legs to prevent the loss of essence—this must be observed with utmost care.\n\nOn days such as *jiǎyín* (Wood Tiger) and *gēngshēn* (Metal Monkey), when the corpse-spirits vie in chaos and the spirit is restless and defiled, one must not share a bed with a spouse, for this is greatly taboo.\n\nThose who dwell in mountains to cultivate truth and study the Dao must be cautious in speech, for mountain spirits and myriad spirits often test them. When sleeping at night, they should close their eyes and visualize the Eye Youth within the Mud Pill Palace, directing their inner gaze to the body’s spirits, thereby attaining long life and ascending to heaven. The immortal Liu Jing once used this method for protection. *(From the* Biographies of Divine Transcendents.*)*\n\nWhen traveling in the mountains, one must wear a cloud hat wrapped in black silk to shield against wind, sun, dust, and sand. In winter, a snow scarf and deerskin robe are worn. Beneath the left armpit, a deerskin pouch must hold medicinal provisions, cinnabar, and life-saving remedies—these must never be lacking. When walking, one may carry a *Zhenling* staff to repel malevolent qi, or ride a mule while a disciple follows, bearing the staff. Such is the bearing of a Daoist, distinct from the ways of the vulgar world.\n\nThose dwelling in mountains may wear a cloth headband, known in the俗 as the \"one-stroke kerchief,\" wrapping a single strip around the head, paired with hempen sandals. A long sash is the attire of reclusive mountain scholars.\n\nWhen gathering herbs in the mountains, one must halt a hundred paces from the mountain, first retreat a hundred paces, then ascend with reversed steps. Thus, mountain spirits will not harm the traveler, all evil will flee in submission, and every poison will hide away. *(From the* Biographies of Divine Transcendents.*)*\n\nWhen passing through mountains or visiting sacred shrines, one should visualize within the mouth a true person named Red Numinous Elder, attended by two jade maidens—one named Hua Zheng, the other She Jing. The Elder wears a crimson gauze robe, while the maidens are clad in yellow above and below. Upon visualization, one must shout: \"Spirits of the shrine, hasten forth! Let all evil be delivered to the Red Numinous Elder to be slain. Let the myriad spirits retreat a thousand *li*!\" This is the method of the Three Heavens’ vanguard for capturing ghosts. *(From the* Sword Classic *and* Biographies of Divine Transcendents.*)*\n\nWhen traveling at night, one should first silently recite the Golden Light Mantra, visualizing one’s own radiance enveloping the body. Recite the Heavenly Peng Mantra, frequently click the teeth, and press the two fingers against the philtrum above the nostrils—thus, no malevolent ghost will dare approach. If a ghost appears, declare: \"By the decree of the Heavenly Emperor, I oversee the Six Heavenly Palaces of Fengdu. The first is the Palace of Zhou’s Absolute Yin, the second the Palace of Tai’s Slaughter and Solemn Affairs, the third the Palace of Mingchen’s Endurance and Martial Might, the fourth the Palace of Tianzhao’s Sinful Qi, the fifth the Palace of Zongling’s Seven Transgressions, and the sixth the Palace of Gansi’s Continuous Grievances. Whoever dares violate me shall face the statutes of Nüqing—no pardon shall be granted!\" Then click the teeth again and recite the Heavenly Peng Mantra, and the ghost will flee a hundred *li*, while demons will not dare intrude.\n\nDaoist practitioners must ensure that when cutting their hair, eating, or handling shoes, pillows, or bedding, no unenlightened person witnesses their haircut, interferes with their meal, moves their shoes, or uses their pillow or bedding. For the ghosts dwelling within the corporeal forms of the vulgar will encroach upon one’s spirit. Thus, Daoists retreat to mountains and forests, secluding themselves to distance themselves from the clamor and filth of the world, severing worldly affairs—all to prevent external things from violating their lives. Guard this well! *(From the* Biographies of Divine Transcendents.*)*\n\nMorning Cultivation on Auspicious Occasions Chapter\n\n**Chapter on Morning Cultivation During Auspicious Occasions**\n\n**First Month**\nOn the **First Day**, the Heavenly Central Festival Assembly occurs.

On these days, one should receive talismans, fast, present memorials, and make petitions to pray for great blessings.\n\nOn the full moon day, it is fitting to pay homage, repent sins, pray for blessings, and give thanks for past transgressions.\n\n**Six Fasting Days**\nThe eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-third, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the month.\nFood is not eaten after noon.\n\n**Three Short Fasting Days**\nThe eighth, fifteenth, and thirtieth days of the month.\nFood is not eaten after noon.\n\n**Six Ding Fasting Days**\nThe *Spring and Autumn Mandate and Sincerity Chart* states: The Yellow Emperor inquired of Taiyi about the Dao of long life, and Taiyi replied, \"Fast on the six Ding days, and you may achieve success.\"\nThe *Inner Transmission* states: The Emperor swore to vanquish Chiyou, then fasted for three days to report to the Supreme Deity. This was the beginning of fasting and abstinence.\n\n**Ten Straight Fasting Days**\nAccording to the *Old唐书*, Zhou Boyangfu transmitted this fast to the king of Tanyao, Fan Tuo Ali, who observed these ten fasts within a month.\n- On the first day, contemplate the Infinite Great Florescence Heavenly Worthy, repent the transgression of killing and harming living beings, and avoid the retribution of inverted hanging and butchery.\n- On the eighth day, contemplate the Jade Clarity Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Upper Realm, repent the transgression of defying principle and pursuing selfishness, and avoid the retribution of golden hammers and iron staves.\n- On the fourteenth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of Transcendent Sagely Salvation, repent the transgression of harming others for personal gain, and avoid the retribution of iron beds and copper pillars.\n- On the fifteenth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure Emperor, repent the transgression of relying on strength to bully the weak, and avoid the retribution of flying spears and drifting halberds.\n- On the eighteenth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of Life-Nurturing Salvation, repent the transgression of self-deception in the heart, and avoid the retribution of intestines pierced and tongues plowed.\n- On the twenty-third day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Perfection and Myriad Blessings, repent the transgression of flattery to the face and slander behind the back, and avoid the retribution of swallowing fire and eating coals.\n- On the twenty-fourth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Empty Sovereign, repent the transgression of delusion and bewilderment, and avoid the retribution of cauldrons of boiling water and furnaces of coals.\n- On the twenty-eighth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Wondrous Ultimate, repent the transgression of willfully committing evil, and avoid the retribution of ice spears and frost blades.\n- On the twenty-ninth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of the True Sovereign and Cavern Spirit, repent the transgression of mistakenly injuring benevolence, and avoid the retribution of burning and scorching.\n- On the thirtieth day, contemplate the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Void Luminous Sovereign, repent the transgression of karmic retribution across the Three Realms, and avoid the retribution of bellies pierced and hearts blocked.\n\nEmperor Gaozong said: Che Yin told Hu monks that all were translated from Sanskrit, with \"Heavenly Worthy\" as \"Buddha\" and \"karmic retribution\" as \"hell,\" thus establishing the ten fasts.\n\n**Fasting in the First, Fifth, and Ninth Months**\nAccording to Dou Ping’s *Phonetic and Exegetical Notes on the Old唐书*, its annotation on Emperor Gaozu’s decree to refrain from executions in the first, fifth, and ninth months states: The Heavenly Emperor created the Great Treasure Mirror to illuminate the Four Great Continents, moving it each month to observe human good and evil. In the first month, the mirror shines on the Southern Jambu Continent; in the second, on the Eastern Victory Continent; in the third, on the Northern Uttarakuru Continent; in the fourth, on the Western Godaniya Continent; in the fifth, again on the Southern Jambu Continent. Rotating thus, the first, fifth, and ninth months all shine upon the Southern Jambu Continent. Therefore, in these three months, criminal laws are reviewed, and taxes and levies are reduced. Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, this has been recorded in the legal codes. During these three months, executions and slaughter are prohibited. Later generations, following the Tang precedent, withheld mutton stipends from officials during these months due to the prohibition on executions and slaughter. In truth, this custom originated in the Tang dynasty, and later generations transmitted it as fasting in the first, fifth, and ninth months. Those with discernment call this the act of the most foolish, while those with even slight wisdom regard such practices as base and shameful. Since the Song dynasty, the Daoist tradition has abolished them.\n\nThe Ten \"Imperial Execution\" Days and Monthly Taboos\nOn these days, burning incense is forbidden; violators forfeit their allotted lifespan.\nFirst month: the second day and *gengshen*; second month: the ninth day and *xinyou*; third month: the tenth day and *gengxu*; fourth month: the eleventh day and *guihai*; fifth month: the eleventh day and *renzi*; sixth month: the tenth day and *guichou*; seventh month: the twelfth day and *jiayin*; eighth month: the thirteenth day and *yimao*; ninth month: the thirteenth day and *bingchen*; tenth month: the eighth day and *dingsi*; eleventh month: the fifteenth day and *bingwu*; twelfth month: the thirteenth day and *dingwei*.\n\nHeavenly Taboo Days\n*Bingyin* and *dingmao*: taboo for Daoist fathers; *bingshen* and *dingyou*: taboo for Daoist mothers; *renchen* and *renxu*: taboo for the Northern Emperor; *wuchen* and *wuxu*: taboo for the Southern Emperor. Days of severed fate and one’s own fate-star; days when Jupiter transits the year’s position; days when the Six Harmful Stars align with one’s fate-star; the last three days of the lunar month; days of annual rupture and yearly clash.\n\nLaozi’s Hair-Restoration Days\nFirst month: the fourth day; second month: the eighth day; third month: the eleventh day; fourth month: the sixteenth day; fifth month: the twentieth day; sixth month: the twenty-fourth day; seventh month: the twenty-eighth day; eighth month: the nineteenth day; ninth month: the sixteenth day; tenth month: the thirteenth day; eleventh month: the tenth day; twelfth month: the seventh day.\n\nIn the thirty-fifth year of the Wanli reign of the Great Ming, cyclical year *dingwei*, on an auspicious day of the Upper Yuan, Zhang Guoxiang, Orthodox Successor of the Zhengyi Tradition, Perfected of Sincere Constancy, Who Propagates the Dao and Expounds the Mysteries, Great Perfected Who Governs the Daoist Teachings Throughout the Realm, by imperial decree oversaw the carving of the printing blocks.\n\nChapter on Numerical Records of Affairs\nHeavenly patterns and earthly configurations, the transformations of yin and yang, the official systems of past and present, rituals and human affairs, systems of caps and robes, music, classics and histories, literary works, elixir arts, medicine, and implements—all are recorded by number.

Chi Jiang Ziyu.\nAll were men of the Yellow Emperor’s time. By the era of Tang Yao, the eight roamed Mount Zhongnan, where people saw them and, because it was the age of Tang Yao, called them the Tang Eight Immortals. Later generations mistakenly applied the name to the Eight Immortals of the Tang Li dynasty, such as Lü Dongbin.\n\nHuainan Eight Masters:\nSu Fei, Li Shang, Zuo Wu, Tian You, Jin Chang (two names missing, their identities lost; later people erroneously substituted two others).\n\nPrince An of Huainan, grandson of Emperor Gaozu and son of Prince Chang of Huainan, was fond of Confucian learning, esoteric arts, and the methods of divine transcendence and flying ascent. He composed the *Inner Book of Huainan* in twenty scrolls, the *Book of Vast Treasures and Myriad Years* in three scrolls, and the *Fire Lotus Sutra* in five scrolls, expounding the principles of Heaven’s Dao and the transformations of creation, thereby attaining the Way of long life and enduring vision. Each year, he refined three hundred *yi* of yellow gold, offering it to the imperial court to replace half the people’s land taxes. The emperor commanded Liu Xiang to seek his method, but after five summons, the prince refused to come. Enraged, the emperor harbored hostile intentions. The prince, unable to resist, entrusted Liu Xiang with the cinnabar script, which Liu tied to his elbow. That night, he knocked at the palace gate, believing the elixir could be completed. After several years, the elixir failed, wasting vast sums, for he had not received the oral transmission—it was but empty words on paper. The emperor, furious, sought to punish him. The prince’s ministers, Lei Bei and Wu Bei, whom he had long favored, were sparring with the crown prince with swords when Lei Bei accidentally wounded the prince’s left thigh. Enraged, the prince refused Lei Bei’s request to join the campaign against the Xiongnu to atone for his crime and sought to execute him. Fearing death, Lei Bei reported the prince’s treason to the emperor. Out of familial affection, the emperor hesitated to punish him, merely stripping him of two counties. Wu Bei, meanwhile, had committed private misdeeds and incurred the prince’s wrath, though no action was taken. Wu Bei, fearing execution, corroborated Lei Bei’s earlier accusation of treason. The廷尉 tortured the prince’s ministers until they confessed, fabricating a confession that the treason was real. Sima Qian included this in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Hereditary House of Huainan*, suppressing the fantastical tales of divine transcendence and flying ascent. The emperor then dispatched the宗正 with the imperial staff to punish the prince. The Eight Masters arrived and said to the prince: “The harm caused by Lei Bei and Wu Bei is truly Heaven’s way of urging you on. Now that your Dao is accomplished, you cannot remain long among men, lest you be slandered by ministers. As a subject who deceives his lord and father, Heaven’s law demands your life.” Thereupon, they prepared a wooden effigy, feigning execution. They suspended the prince’s cap and robes from a beam with a wooden pestle, then ascended a mountain with him to perform a great sacrifice. They buried gold in the earth, and the entire household ascended to Heaven in broad daylight. When the宗正 arrived, he saw the prince’s corpse hanging in the courtyard. Suddenly, a report came: “He is not truly dead.” The prince and his family had fled to the mountains of Huainan, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. The宗正 pursued to the spot but heard only orioles singing in the sky and dogs barking among the clouds. He returned to report to the court. The emperor, filled with regret, executed Lei Bei and Wu Bei, fulfilling the Eight Masters’ words. The *Records of the Grand Historian* records that the prince committed suicide, concealing the tale of his ascension lest later rulers, enamored of the methods of divine transcendence and flying ascent, abandon their sacred duties. Lei Bei and Wu Bei were the prince’s ministers, the true criminals who slandered him. Later generations, unaware of the Eight Masters’ names, mistakenly included the two traitors among them. This account is thus recorded to correct the error.\n\nEight Salivas:\nThe outer edges beyond the Nine Provinces:\nEastern Sand Sea,\nSoutheastern Sinking Marsh,\n\nSouthward lies the Vast

An in the distant lands of Yuechang, once a Chinese commandery governed by a prefect who administered its borders and reported it as a Blissful Realm—no further details are included.\n\nThe Offering of Sacrificial Items\nAccording to the *Tongling Miyao*, the names of sacrificial offerings for the jiao rites are listed as follows:\nDried white magpie with water bamboo shoots;\nMulberry moths;\nDried monkey with fragrant mushrooms;\n\nDried chicken with wood ear mushrooms;\nDried white elephant with lotus seeds;\nDried white horse with coltsfoot flowers;\nDried dragon with wheat;\nDried deer with ox tripe;\nDried lightning from the sea with rhubarb;\nDried mountain boar with water spinach;\nDried \"knowing-intestines\" with plantain seeds;\nDried marrow from forest horses with sour jujubes;\nDried sprouts with mountain-enclosed red berries;\nDried fish from water with lotus roots;\nDried green caltrop with lily bulbs;\nDried white meat with camphor willow;\nDried earth with sweet flag;\nDried mountain deer with elk;\nFine-scaled fish;\nOil-and-honey cakes;\nGreat sacrifice ox;\nLesser sacrifice sheep;\nCelestial wine and spring water.\n\nGreat broth—meat juice. Unseasoned, without the washing of plums. In the earliest antiquity, when the raw first transformed into the rank, meat was merely boiled and its juice drunk, without knowledge of blending flavors. Later generations, revering antiquity in their sacrifices, thus presented only meat juice, calling it *great broth*.\n\nMysterious water—at all sacrificial rites, when wine vessels are arrayed, mysterious water is placed above the three wines. This exaltation of mysterious water signifies reverence for antiquity, setting the vessel foremost.\n\n*Yu-zeng*—the Zhou people esteemed libations, using *yu* and *zao* combined. True yin reaches the deep springs; the libation is poured with jade tablets, employing the qi of jade.\n\nStraw dogs—objects for praying to heaven and beseeching rain, existing before the Three Dynasties.\n\nThe foods used are all the same as those of the secular world, except for wine, tea, pepper-blossom wine, *tusu* wine, thousand-day wine, thousand-league wine, and tofu, all of which originated in the Daoist tradition.\n\nWine—*The Inner Transmission of the Yellow Emperor* states: The Queen Mother met the Emperor at Mount Song, offering him wine to protect the spirit, nourish qi, preserve the fullness of fluids, and flow with radiance, as well as wine to extend vast longevity and luminous life. Thus, wine already existed in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Yet it remains unknown in which era Du Kang lived, though from ancient times to the present, many have claimed he first created wine.\n\n*Tusu* wine—*Tusu*, as recorded in the *Erya*, is the name of Sun Simiao’s hermitage, signifying the eradication of ghostly qi and the awakening of human souls. The True Man Sun first devised it. Its food offerings are the same as those for pepper-blossom wine.\n\n**Pepper-Blossom Wine**—*Records of the Seasons* states: On New Year’s Day, pepper-blossom wine is offered. Pepper is the essence of the Jade Balance Star; consuming it makes the body light and fleet of foot, prolonging life and enhancing longevity. The order of serving the wine is determined by age, with the eldest first.\n\n**Thousand-Day Wine**—Liu Xuanshi of Zhongshan purchased thousand-day wine and fell into a slumber lasting a thousand days.\n\n**Thousand-League Wine**—Liu Yao of Liang records: In Chenxiang of Guiyang, there was a thousand-league wine; upon drinking it, one would arrive home intoxicated, beginning from the village itself.\n\n**Tea**—During the reign of King Zhao of Zhou, Laozi departed through the Hangu Pass. Yin Xi welcomed him to his home and first offered *ming*, marking the origin of tea. Laozi said: \"Those who consume this tea are all disciples of your Dao.\" Later, it became customary that whenever guests arrived at a household, tea was served first—this was its beginning. *Ming* is tea. Its names are: first *tu* (tea), second *jia*, third *she*, fourth *ming*, and fifth *chuan*.\n\n**Tofu**—The Prince of Huainan attained the Dao of soaring transformation, refining the five metals into treasures and transmuting the eight minerals into water. Having mastered the principles of plant alchemy, he created tofu. At that time, a *dou* of beans in Chang’an was worth a thousand coins. Today, those who observe vegetarian fasts all use it. A poem says: \"The whole household learned the arts of Huainan’s guard.\" The consumption of tofu by later generations began with the Prince of Huainan.\n\n**Tortoise-Peach**—The Yellow Emperor offered *mian* as tortoise-peach in his sacrifices to Heaven, symbolizing the offerings of immortals. Thereafter, all who performed vegetarian rites and jiao ceremonies used it, beginning with the Yellow Emperor.\n\n**Birthday Celebrations and Poison-Averting**—Qian Keng presented incense and a pheasant stew on Yao’s birthday, along with a handkerchief, to celebrate Yao’s longevity. Yao enfeoffed Keng as Lord of Pengcheng. The custom of exchanging handkerchiefs to celebrate birthdays began with this. The compilation of this book removes superfluous passages, awaiting presentation at the celestial gates.\n\nAll lesser officials under the Southern Culmen who publish and circulate this book shall have their transgressions pardoned, merits recorded with one rank of advancement, lifespan extended by one *ji* upon their destined allotment, and blessings flourishing for three generations.\n\n**The Jade Register of the Heavenly Emperor’s Supreme Dao and Great Purity, Lower Scroll**—Concluded.",

      "translated_text": "**The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register*. Compiled by Zhu Quan of the Ming. Two scrolls, nineteen chapters. Base text from the *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n**Preface to The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register**\n\nHow magnificent! How resplendent!\n\nI say: the world has extraordinary men who accomplish extraordinary deeds. Without them, who could fathom the profound mysteries of the celestial Dao or plumb the abyssal depths of its source? Breaking through white clouds, grasping the azure vine, ascending emerald peaks, scaling layered ridges, traversing perilous cliffs of ten thousand fathoms, and climbing the summit of Mount Tai—looking down upon the earth below, one may deem oneself lofty. Yet who knows that riding the celestial winds as lightly as goose down, treading the rainbow as though straddling a blue dragon, roaming beyond the Great Void, touching the sun and moon, grasping the stars, licking the azure heavens, and gazing down upon the dusty world—how vast is such a spirit!\n\nUnless one chews the blossoms of the Three Spirits, inhales the radiance of the Nine Lights, rinses the mouth with purple jade’s richness, and savors the true essence of primordial qi, how could one wander the spirit through the mysterious gate, ride the luminous winds of Langfeng, tread the azure void, and expound the celestial Dao?\n\nNow, the composition of this book is like a divine chariot emerging from the vast sea or the rising sun dispelling the darkest night. It can cleanse the vulgarity of worldly dust and adorn the divine splendor of Mount Taihua. Thus, fixing the mind upon the numinous realm, one explores the Supreme Dao at the Celestial Ford; silently aligning with the Great Mystery, one grasps the divine pivot at the Purple Ultimate. For years, I have daily traced the sacred mysteries of the Perfected and probed the pivot of creation’s workings.\n\nHerein, I dissect the unformed chaos before the division of heaven and earth, incise the primordial vastness before the Prior Heaven, reveal the hidden mechanisms of the Great Bird before its manifestation, and clarify the inception of the Great Simplicity in the generation of beings. From the undifferentiated state before the separation of the dark and light, down to the first emergence of human culture, since the establishment of the Daoist teachings—when the Three August Ones founded the ultimate principle and the Five Emperors received the mandate of heaven—those who revered the Dao and cultivated the celestial Dao: their teachings’ affairs were incomplete, their profound words unproclaimed, their institutions untransmitted, their rituals unrectified. I have therefore examined and renewed them. If not I, then who could accomplish this?\n\nThus, after thrice bathing and purifying, I pledged before the divine luminaries and reported to the Heavenly Thearch. I extensively consulted the classical texts, delved into every category, and thoroughly investigated all matters. Greatly proclaiming the mysterious transformation, I elucidated the initial separation of heaven and earth, the first division of creation, the inception of the Dao’s lineage, the forms of ritual, the preparation of implements, the systems of robes and crowns, rites and music, the profound mysteries of the celestial mind, and the regulations of the Daoist gate’s decorum. All were established as fixed standards. Whatever the Daoist gate employs is recorded in this book.\n\nThus, I name it *The Heavenly August Supreme Dao Great Clarity Jade Register*.\n\nFrom the beginning of creation to the present day, across hundreds of millions of years, all who have possessed states or households have revered the celestial Dao above and cultivated human affairs below. Therefore, they built the Circular Mound to sacrifice to heaven and erected the Square Mound to offer to earth—all esteeming the celestial Dao. In every imperial decree, it is said: “Reverently following the mandate of heaven.” The *Book of Zhou* states: “Heaven above bestows its mandate.” The *Book of Tang* says: “The enlightened king reverently follows the celestial Dao.” Never has there been a time when the celestial Dao was not revered and the celestial mandate not received.\n\nAlas! The mysterious wind has long been in decline.",

      "translated_text": "The Emaciated Immortal says: Tracing the origins of the Daoist teachings, in the primordial chaos of antiquity, when the human Dao first emerged, the Mandate of Heaven was not yet complete. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, inheriting the destiny of the Nine August Ones, rode the six dragons to govern the heavens, established the celestial pole on behalf of Heaven, and thereby fixed the Three Powers.\n\nAt that time, Heaven and Earth had not yet become luminous and distinct. There were no written characters, so knotted cords served in place of governance; no houses, so nests and caves became dwellings; no clothing, so bound grasses covered the body; no vessels, so cupped hands held water for drinking. Our Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, first created written characters, fashioned garments, built palaces, and crafted utensils—thus were the affairs of humanity made complete.\n\nNow, among the Nine Schools and within the Three Teachings, the written characters in use, the clothing worn, the houses inhabited, and the vessels employed all originated with the Yellow Emperor’s innovations—all derived from the teachings of our Daoist school and the Yellow Emperor. Moreover, Laozi said: That which gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humanity, and the myriad things must itself have a source. He declared: “I know not its name, and so forcefully call it the Dao, and forcefully style it the Great—thus it is called the Great Dao.” Its teaching is called Daoism, and from this the world first received the name “Dao.”\n\nBy this reasoning, all who speak of cultivating the Dao or studying the Dao are but appropriating Laozi’s words to take “Dao” as their name—are they not disciples of Laozi’s lineage? Furthermore, Laozi’s words—“mysterious and yet more mysterious, the gateway to all wonders”—the very terms “mysterious” and “wondrous” were borrowed from revered names and employed in the scriptures, all using Laozi’s language.\n\nAgain, in the writings of Zhuangzi it is said: “Only after the Great Awakening does one know the sage.” The name “Great Awakening” was established by Zhuangzi, and later Emperor Huizong of Song took it to bestow the title “Golden Immortal,” using it throughout his scriptures—all derived from the books of our Daoist school and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, Laozi, and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn ancient times, the Earl of the West attended Laozi with two youths, to whom Laozi gave the names “Auspicious” and “As-You-Will.” Later generations have all used these names, appropriating Laozi’s words—are they not disciples of Laozi’s lineage?",

      "translated_text": "The teachings of the Yellow Emperor were to create and regulate all things to manifest the Dao of Heaven, serving as the foundation of governance. The Emperor himself declared: “To observe the Dao of Heaven and grasp the workings of Heaven—this is perfection.” As seen in the *Classic of the Yin Confluence*.\n\nThe teachings of Laozi, according to the *Er Ya* and the *Treatise on Arts and Letters*, were to “embrace purity and emptiness to guard the self, and maintain humility and weakness to sustain the body.” This is the art of the ruler facing south. It aligns with Yao and Shun’s virtue of yielding, and the *Book of Changes’* principle of modesty. “One act of modesty brings fourfold benefit”—this is its strength. Thus, to regard the state as one’s own body, and govern the state as one governs the self, is to “value the self above all under Heaven.” Only when one can entrust the self to the world may one be entrusted with the world—all these are the principles of self-cultivation, family regulation, state governance, and world pacification. As seen in the *Dao De Jing*, these are the Dao of China’s sages. Hence, it is called the *Orthodox Dao*.\n\nWhat is the Orthodox Dao? China, dwelling at the center of Heaven and Earth, receives the upright *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Its people possess upright forms and upright voices. Their teachings do not employ foreign speech; they dare not speak unless it is the language of the former kings. Thus, there are no words of translation or false attribution. Their attire is not foreign; they dare not wear anything but the lawful garments of the former kings. What they wear are the robes and crowns of the Yellow Emperor, hence the title “Yellow-Crowned.” They do not mutilate their bodies, for “the body, hair, and skin are received from one’s parents and must not be harmed”—this is the beginning of filial piety. Those who attain the Dao ascend in broad daylight, soaring to Heaven to glorify their parents—this is the ultimate filial piety. They do not abandon their surnames, nor forget their kin, nor erase their ancestors—this is the filial duty of a child. In court, they observe proper decorum, practicing the rites of ruler and minister. As ministers, they serve the Supreme Emperor—this is the righteousness of a subject. They study the books of the sages and follow the Dao of the sages, adhering to ritual and righteousness. The principles of Confucianism and Daoism are one.\n\nThis Dao existed before the separation of Heaven and Earth, and its teachings were established in the era of the Three Sovereigns. It is not what Confucius meant when he said that later ages would have only recorders, and that heterodoxies would arise to distort the great principles. Among its followers, those of China are ranked above, while foreigners are ranked below. The teachings have distinctions of precedence, and people have divisions between Chinese and barbarians, as well as differences in nobility and baseness.\n\nAmong the Jurchen women who cultivate the Dao, they do not leave their chambers, do not gather in temples, and do not conceal themselves among men and women. Their clothing is distinct, and their teachings are free from perversity. They do not delude the world or deceive the people with doctrines of karmic retribution, misfortune, or fortune. They do not coerce others into donating their bodies or wealth as merit, nor do they act contrary to the Heaven that gave them birth or forget the land that bore them. Born in China, they uphold the Dao of China and do not forget their fundamental principles. Those who deviate from this Dao are not orthodox.\n\nThis teaching spreads across the Four Seas and is practiced throughout the world, beneath the utmost reaches of Heaven’s canopy and the utmost bounds of Earth’s support, within the light of the sun and moon and where frost and dew descend. Among all living people, the Dao they revere, the words they use, the clothes they wear, the dwellings they inhabit, and the utensils they employ—all were created by China’s sages, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Are they not all derived from our Daoist teachings?\n\nThe *Book of Zhou* states: “Within the realm, there are Four Great Ones: the Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the king is great.” Within the Three Realms, nothing surpasses these in greatness. Confucius said: “Those who know by birth are the highest; those who know by learning come next; those who learn through difficulty come after. As for methods of cultivation and action—these are not what the sages esteem.” Thus, they are not considered great. Is it not that the *kun* and *fei* trigrams existed at the beginning of creation, coeval with Heaven and Earth? Therefore, Daoism takes Heaven as its master. How magnificent is the Dao of Heaven!\n\nI have seen books that seek to eradicate Confucianism and Daoism, which state: “In destroying the Dao, even the Jade Emperor of the Great Mystery trembles in the Nine Heavens, and the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning loses his gallbladder atop the Three Clarities.” Such vile words swarm like bees, too numerous to transcribe. In attacking Confucianism, they claim: “The teachings of Confucius are of little use in governing the world, do not comprehend nature and destiny, and only address the present life. He may be called a worthy, but not a sage.” They further say: “Confucius’ name and status were no different from ordinary people. He merely transmitted the words of the former kings and had no teachings of his own—he was only a compiler, not the source of a teaching. What Confucius spoke were mere expedients to correct the world, and what Mencius spoke was merely to criticize narrow-mindedness. The Confucian school is base, nothing more than a trinket among the vulgar.” These are all books written using the script created by the Yellow Emperor, yet they turn against the Yellow Emperor’s teachings, slander the learning of Confucius and Laozi, insult the Heavenly Emperor, and exalt themselves. Is this not an egregious error?\n\nAlas! Laozi said: “The superior person does not contend; the inferior person loves to contend. Only because he does not contend does the world have none who can contend with him.” The sage foresaw this long ago.\n\nWhen I was eleven years old, still in childhood, I encountered an elderly woman in blue garments who said to me: “You must never forget your long-held aspiration. Only after sixty years may you be permitted to speak.” Thus, I now record these matters directly.\n\nIn the forty-seventh year of Shaohao’s reign, in the year *zhaoyang chifenruo*, I received the mandate of the Great Clarity to be enfeoffed as the lord of □□ in Hedong. By the thirty-first year of King Wuding of Shang, in the year *sangzhao yanmao*, 1,029 years later, I ascended to the Great Clarity and was specially advanced as the True Lord of the South Pole, the Subtle and Empty Dao, residing in the ninety-fourth palace of the South Pole. In Heaven, I served for 2,699 years. The Great Clarity bestowed upon me the Jade Seal of Penglai and the Golden Talisman of the Great Yang, commanding me to descend to the mortal world to rectify the Dao of Heaven, revive the mystic winds, grasp the numinous pivot, and unfold the transformations of the profound.",

Vague and indistinct, silent and formless, abstruse and obscure, it cannot be heard. Compelled to give it a name, we call it the Dao.\"\n\nThe Dao is lofty beyond reach, profound beyond measure. It envelops Heaven and Earth, bestowed without form. Its source flows ceaselessly, empty yet never full. Constricted, it can expand; obscure, it can illuminate; supple, it can be firm. Embracing yin and exhaling yang, it unfolds the Three Luminaries. Mountains rise high by it; abysses grow deep by it. Beasts run by it; birds fly by it. Stars and constellations move by it. By it, non-being gives rise to being; the humble attains honor; retreat secures precedence. Thus, though unseen and unheard, from formlessness it generates form; from soundlessness, the Five Tones resound; from tastelessness, the Five Flavors arise; from colorlessness, the Five Colors emerge. Therefore, being arises from non-being, and existence from emptiness. By the principle of the One, it extends to the four seas and pervades Heaven and Earth.\n\nIn its wholeness, it is simple as an uncarved block; in its dispersion, it is vast as turbid waters. Turbid, it gradually clarifies; empty, it gradually fills. Serene as the great sea, drifting like floating clouds—seemingly absent yet present, seemingly existent yet vanished. The Weishi clan attained it to grasp Heaven and Earth; Fuxi attained it to inherit the Mother of Qi. The Northern Dipper attains it to remain unerring through the ages; the sun and moon attain it to remain ceaseless through the ages. Kunlun and Feng Yi attain it to roam the great rivers; Jian Wu attains it to dwell on Mount Tai. The Yellow Emperor attained it to ascend the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu attained it to reside in the Dark Palace. Yuqiang attained it to dwell at the North Pole; the Queen Mother attained it to sit in the Lesser Expanse. None know its beginning; none know its end. Peng Zu attained it, living from the time of Youyu to five hundred years later. Fu Yue attained it to serve King Wuding, ruling all under Heaven. Riding the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket, he ascended to become a constellation. Thus, Confucius asked Laozi: \"Today, in leisure, I venture to inquire about the Supreme Dao.\"\n\nLaozi replied: \"Purify your heart and wash your spirit; temper your knowledge and refine your awareness. The Dao—how indescribably difficult it is to speak of! Let me tell you its outline. The luminous arises from the obscure; order emerges from formlessness. The spirit is mastered by the Dao, coming from boundlessness and going to no end. Without gate or chamber, it is vast and all-pervading. Its use does not weary the mind; its response to things is without limit. Heaven cannot but be high; Earth cannot but be broad; the sun and moon cannot but move; the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao!\n\nIf the Dao could be presented to others, then none would fail to offer it to their parents. If the Dao could be told to others, then none would fail to tell it to their siblings. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then none would fail to pass it to their descendants. Yet it cannot be—there is no other reason: if the center is not mastered, the Dao cannot be known. If you return and seek it within yourself, the Dao is not far.\"\n\nConfucius returned and remained silent for three days. Zigong, perplexed, asked: \"Master, when you met Lao Dan, what advice did he give?\" Confucius said: \"Birds—I know they can fly; fish—I know they can swim; beasts—I know they can run. For those that fly, I can use a net; for those that swim, I can use a line; for those that run, I can use a snare. But as for the dragon, coalescing into form and dispersing into patterns, riding the clouds and ascending to Heaven—I cannot fathom it. Today, seeing Lao Dan is like seeing the dragon! My mouth gapes and cannot close; my spirit is disordered, and I know not where to dwell. What advice could I seek from Lao Dan?\"\n\nThus, Yanzi praised the Dao of the sage: \"The more one looks up to it, the higher it seems; the more one delves into it, the firmer it becomes. Gazing ahead, it is suddenly behind.\" This is the Dao of which Laozi spoke: \"Look at it and it cannot be seen; listen to it and it cannot be heard; pursue it and its front cannot be seen; follow it and its rear cannot be seen.\" Such is the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"August Heaven has no second Dao; the sage has no dual heart.\"\n\nTherefore, I must straighten my robe and compose my countenance, raise my hands in a solemn bow, and offer a single word of counsel to the wise:\n\n*\"Beyond kalpas, fragrant responses are not far—*\n*borne on the breeze into the jeweled chambers of immortals.\"*\n\nIf you recognize this intimately here, you need only this single word: *Dao*. If you lack the eye, you will but somersault within your nostrils.\n\nHah! I open my mouth to laugh for you, and unawares, white clouds arise over the western hills.\n\nThe primordial *qi* is a thing of undifferentiated wholeness, born before Heaven and Earth. It stands alone and does not change; it circulates without cease and may be called the Mother of Heaven and Earth. Before Heaven and Earth existed, its *qi* was chaotic as a hen’s egg, dark and moist, beginning to sprout. The vast primeval mist grew luminous, and the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate enfolded the Three as One.\n\n*Ji* means \"ultimate\"; *yuan* means \"beginning.\" The pure and light ascended to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descended to become Earth. The harmonious *qi* became human; the motley *qi* became the myriad things.\n\nIn the time before Heaven and Earth divided, the primordial *qi* was blended as one—this was the Grand Beginning, the Grand Unity. As the *Daodejing* says: \"The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two.\" This is the primordial *qi* of the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe Great Ultimate arises from the Ultimateless. In movement, it generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it becomes still, and in stillness generates yin. When stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness alternate, each the root of the other. Yin and yang divide, and the Two Modes are established. The Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. Creation is thus determined—this is the august title of Heaven’s principle.\n\n*Ji* means \"utmost extremity\"; *shu* and *ren* are names for the root and foundation. This is what is meant by the pivot and hinge of Heaven, the root and foundation.\n\nOnce the primordial *qi* divided, yin and yang were distinguished. Soundless and scentless, the light and pure floated upward to form Heaven; the heavy and turbid sank downward to form Earth. Heaven moves with vigor, circulating without rest. The sun, moon, and stars are suspended from it, and the myriad things are covered by it. Heaven is vast, Earth small; their surfaces are enveloped in water. Earth stands upon *qi* and floats upon water.\n\nHeaven’s motion is like the turning of a wheel’s hub, like a hat covering the Earth. Above and below, the primordial *qi* is as if a lidded box were pressed upon water to keep it from flowing—*qi* fills its midst. As the *Treatise on Heaven* says: \"Heaven is round like a tilted canopy; Earth is square like a chessboard.\" Heaven revolves, half above the Earth and half below. The sun and moon, though moving eastward, are drawn westward by Heaven’s rotation into the sea, like ants on a millstone: the millstone turns left, the ants crawl right; the millstone moves swiftly, the ants slowly, and so they cannot but go west. Earth moves ceaselessly, like a person sitting in a closed boat who does not perceive its motion—such is the vigor of the primordial *qi*, floating and roaming without rest.\n\nThe *Comprehensive Mirror’s Outer Annals* says: \"Heaven and Earth were chaotic as a hen’s egg. Pangu was born within it. After eighteen thousand years, Heaven and Earth split open. The clear yang became Heaven; the turbid yin became Earth. Pangu was within them, transforming nine times a day. He was divine in Heaven and sagely on Earth. Each day, Heaven rose a *zhang* higher, Earth grew a *zhang* thicker, and Pangu grew a *zhang* taller. After eighteen thousand years, Heaven reached its utmost height, Earth its utmost depth, and Pangu his utmost length. Thus living things began with Pangu, the ancestor of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. When he died, his head became the Five Peaks; his eyes, the sun and moon; his fat and marrow, the rivers and seas; his hair and beard, the grasses and trees.\"\n\nIt is also said: \"Pangu’s tears became rivers; his breath, the wind; his voice, thunder; the pupils of his eyes, lightning. His joy became clear skies; his anger, overcast. Among the popular tales of the Qin and Han, Pangu’s head became the Eastern Peak; his belly, the Central Peak; his left arm, the Southern Peak; his right arm, the Northern Peak; his feet, the Western Peak. Only afterward did the Three Sovereigns appear. This is the beginning of Heaven, Earth, and humanity.\"\n\nNumbers arise from the One, stand upon the Three, are completed in the Five, flourish in the Seven, and reside in the Nine. Thus Heaven is ninety thousand *li* from Earth.\n\nThe Measurements of Heaven and Earth:\nThe celestial body spans 357,000 *li* from east to west and north to south. Each quadrant measures 89,250 *li*. From Earth to Heaven is 80,000 *li*. Taking half the sun’s illumination of Yangcheng as the center, the body is perfectly round. The Southern Pole, seventy-two degrees, is hidden and unseen, forming the lower compass; the Northern Pole, seventy-two degrees, is visible and unhidden, forming the upper compass. Each degree measures 2,930 *li*, 71 *bu*, 2 *chi*, 7 *cun*, and 4 *fen*. In general terms, each degree is 3,000 *li*. Measured from below, each degree is as large as the sun’s disk at noon. Three hundred sixty-five degrees extend downward to the first layer of the Yellow Springs and upward to the starry heavens—97,200 *li*. From the lowest depths of the Nine Dark Abysses to the starry heavens is 12,180,000 *li*, as verified by the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Distances of the Directions:\nThe eastern extreme is where the sun rises; the western frontier, where it sets. The diameter between them is 200,023,572 *bu* and 72 *bu*. From the southern extreme to the northern frontier, the diameter is 230,500,075 *bu*, 75 *bu* less than the east-west span. These are the measurements recorded by Yu’s minister, Zhang Hai.\n\nThe Center:\nIt receives the correct *qi* of Heaven and Earth and fully embodies the transformations of the Five Phases. In Heaven, it is called the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Phases; in humanity, the Five Constants. Thus when humans are born, their form and appearance are correct, their voices are correct. Therefore, the Yellow Emperor matched Heaven, and the color of the center is called yellow. His teachings took Heaven as their master—thus they are called the Heavenly Dao.\n\nAll emperors and kings who possess the world revere Heaven to receive its mandate, honor the Heavenly Dao to govern the world. Thus it is said: \"They receive Heaven’s bright mandate and encompass the Four Seas.\"",

      "translated_text": "The East:\nThe place where the sun rises, where the *qi* of generation resides. It governs spring and belongs to Wood. Its people are benevolent, called the *Dongyi* (Eastern Barbarians). The character *yi* (夷) contains *ren* (人, \"person\"), for they receive the clear *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The three mountains of Penglai and the ten isles of Fanghu lie here, so its people delight in longevity.\n\nThe West:\nThe place where the sun sets, where the *qi* of withering and killing resides. It governs autumn and belongs to Metal. Its people are fierce, called the *Qianghu*, *Quanrong* (Dog Barbarians). The characters *qiang* (羌) and *quan* (犬, \"dog\") reflect that they receive the turbid *qi* of Heaven and Earth. Ghosts and yin beings dwell here, so they delight in death.\n\nThe South:\nThe place of blazing brightness, where the *qi* of scorching heat resides. It governs summer and belongs to Fire. Its people are cunning, endlessly deceitful, called the *Tianman* (Field Barbarians). The character *man* (蛮) contains *chong* (虫, \"insect\"), including the *Miaoliao* and *Hu* tribes, for they receive the mixed *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The lands of shorn hair and bare feet lie here, so they delight in banditry and killing.\n\nThe North:\nThe place of accumulated yin, where the *qi* of severe cold resides. It governs winter and belongs to Water. Its people are brave, called the *Beidi* (Northern Barbarians), *Xianyun*, *Tujue*. The character *di* (狄) contains *quan* (犬, \"dog\"), for they receive the dark and gloomy *qi* of Heaven and Earth. The Khitan and Xiongnu dwell here, so they deem dying of illness inauspicious and death in battle auspicious.\n\nThe Sun and Moon:\nThe *Records of the Five Phases and Years of Emperors* states: After Pangu’s death, his left eye became the sun, his right eye the moon.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: Beyond the southeast’s *Mei* and between the *Gan* waters lies the land of Xihe. There is a woman named Xihe, wife of the Emperor, who gave birth to the ten suns.\nGuo Pu’s commentary notes: Xihe is likely the one who first gave birth to the sun and moon in Heaven and Earth.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* further states: In the wilds of *Quanhuang*, atop Yang Valley, stands Fusang, where the ten suns bathe. Nine suns dwell on the lower branches, one on the upper, each containing a crow within.\nThe *Master Huainan* states: The sun is solid, a great luminous essence. Within it is a limping crow, called the three-legged crow.\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states: The spirit of Mount Zhong is named Zhuyin. When it opens its eyes, it is day; when it closes them, night. When it blows, it is winter; when it exhales, summer. Its body stretches a thousand *li*, with a human face and serpent’s body, crimson in color. It is also called the Torch Dragon. Heaven is incomplete in the northwest, lacking the ebb and flow of yin and yang, so a dragon holds fire essence to illuminate the Gate of Heaven.\n\nThe Moon:\nThe *Master Huainan* states: The moon is Heaven’s emissary, the cold *qi* of accumulated yin, long condensed into water. The essence of water’s *qi* becomes the moon. The moon is the east of yin, so when the moon wanes, fish brains diminish.\nThe *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: The moon is the root of all yin. At the full moon, clams and oysters are full, all yin at its peak; at the new moon, clams and oysters are empty, all yin withdrawn.\n\nStars and Constellations:\nThe word *xing* (星, \"star\") means essence. The essence of the myriad things ascends to become the arrayed stars. It is also said to be the essence of water, or the essence of mountains and rivers ascending to become the arrayed stars. It is also said that yang essence forms the sun, and the sun divides to become stars—hence the character *xing* (星) is composed of *ri* (日, \"sun\") and *sheng* (生, \"to generate\").\n*Chen* (辰) refers to the Northern Asterism, called the North Pole, where the *Chen* star resides as the pivot.\nThe *Comprehensive Calendar* states: The Lord of Earth established the stars and constellations.\nThe commentary to the *Astronomical Records of the Later Han* states: The Yellow Emperor divided the stellar lodges. There are 124 constantly visible stars, 320 with ancient names, and 11,520 faint stars—all created by the Yellow Emperor.\nYet the *Book of Rites* states that Emperor Ku ordered the stars and constellations. Thus, the Lord of Earth first established the stars, the Yellow Emperor named them, and Emperor Ku later ordered them.\n\nThe Northern Asterism:\nThe North Pole has five stars, with Taiyi always at the center—this is the Pole Star. *Chen* is not a star but the central boundary. When the Pole Star resides at the center, the arrayed lodges align, a pattern existing since the beginning of creation.\n\nStellar Lodges:\nThe *Genealogy of Emperors* states: Upon receiving the Mandate, the Yellow Emperor calculated and divided the stellar lodges to establish pitch standards.\nThe *Han Records* also states: The Yellow Emperor fixed the stellar lodges, as recorded in the *Erya*’s twelve divisions and twenty-eight lodges—all created by the Yellow Emperor.\n\nLodge Degrees:\nFuxi observed the patterns of the five stars and divided their approximate degrees.\nThe *Records of the Grand Scribe’s Historian: Treatise on the Calendar* states: The Yellow Emperor named the lodge degrees.\nMinister Yan Zan said: Naming the lodge degrees means observing the degrees of the Three Luminaries’ advance and retreat to verify auspicious and inauspicious omens.\nIt also states: Emperor Wu of Han summoned masters of esoteric arts, and Tang Du divided the celestial divisions.\nThe *Han Shu’s Sound and Meaning* notes: He divided the twenty-eight lodges into bounded degrees.\nThe *Astronomical Records of the Jin* also states: Fuxi established the degrees of the celestial circumference.\n\nClouds:\nThe *Supplementary Exegesis* states: The *qi* of Heaven and Earth exhales to form clouds and inhales to form wind. Clouds are so named for their motion (*yun*, 运), rising when they strike stone.\nFog:\nWater vapor ascends and overflows, becoming fog. It is also said that when the *qi* of yin and yang are disordered, fog forms. Or that when earth’s *qi* rises and Heaven’s *qi* descends in response, fog arises.\n\nRain:\nWhen the *qi* of yin and yang harmonize, rain forms. Water descends from clouds as rain. Rain (*yu*, 雨) means to assist (*fu*, 辅), assisting and nourishing the seasons.\n\nThe Eight Winds:\nThe *Comprehensive Discussions in the White Tiger Hall* states: What is wind? Wind (*feng*, 风) means to germinate (*meng*, 萌). It nurtures things to completion, thus corresponding to the eight trigrams. Yang is established at five, reaching its peak at nine-five. After forty-five days, it transforms, and this transformation produces wind. Yin joins with yang to generate wind. Forty-five days after the winter solstice, the *Tiaofeng* (Regulating Wind) arrives. *Tiao* means to govern. After another forty-five days, the *Mingshu Feng* (Bright Multitude Wind) arrives. *Mingshu* means to welcome the masses. After another forty-five days, the *Qingming Feng* (Clear Bright Wind) arrives. *Qingming* means clear and sharp.",

      "translated_text": "After another forty-five days, the *Jingfeng* (Majestic Wind) arrives. *Jing* means great, as yang qi grows and nourishes. After another forty-five days, the *Liangfeng* (Cool Wind) arrives. *Liang* means cold, as yin qi begins to move. After another forty-five days, the *Changhe Feng* (Gate-Closing Wind) arrives, signaling the time for storing and preserving. After another forty-five days, the *Buzhou Feng* (Unbound Wind) arrives. *Buzhou* means unjoined, as yin and yang have yet to harmonize and transform. After another forty-five days, the *Guangmo Feng* (Vast Desert Wind) arrives. *Guangmo* means vast, aligning with yang qi.\n\nThus, when the *Tiaofeng* arrives, the earth warms; when the *Mingshu Feng* arrives, all things are born; when the *Qingming Feng* arrives, the forms of things dry; when the *Jingfeng* arrives, thorns bear fruit; when the *Liangfeng* arrives, millet and grain ripen; when the *Changhe Feng* arrives, shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout; when the *Buzhou Feng* arrives, burrowing creatures hide; and when the *Guangmo Feng* arrives, all things lie dormant.\n\nTherefore, the ruler follows and aligns with these winds: when the *Tiaofeng* arrives, light punishments are issued and delays resolved; when the *Mingshu Feng* arrives, borders are repaired and fields cultivated; when the *Qingming Feng* arrives, silks and treasures are presented to envoys sent among the feudal lords; when the *Jingfeng* arrives, the virtuous are ennobled and the meritorious enfeoffed; when the *Liangfeng* arrives, the earth’s virtue is repaid, transforming the four regions; when the *Changhe Feng* arrives, legal punishments are applied and granaries prepared; when the *Buzhou Feng* arrives, palaces and city walls are constructed; and when the *Guangmo Feng* arrives, capital sentences are carried out and judicial punishments enforced.\n\n**The Celestial River (Tianhan)**\nIt originates between the *Ji* (Winnowing Basket) and *Wei* (Tail) asterisms in the east, called the *Tianhe* (Celestial River) or *Hanjin* (River Ford). It divides into two paths: the southern route passes through the *Chuanshuo* (Roving Fisherman), *Yuxing* (Fish Star), *Tianyao* (Celestial Key), *Tianbian* (Celestial Basket), and *He Gu* (River Drum); the northern route traverses the *Gui* (Tortoise), piercing below *Ji*, then through *Ci* (Silk), south of *Nan* (Southern Dipper), *Beikui* (Northern Ladle), and *Zuoxi* (Left Banner) to *Tianjin* (Celestial Ford), where it descends and merges with the southern route before proceeding southwest. It then divides again, flanking the *Paogua* (Gourd), threading through the *Renxing* (Human Star), *Chu* (Pestle), *Zaofu* (Charioteer), *Tengshe* (Flying Serpent), *Wangliang* (Wagoner), *Fulu* (Auxiliary Road), *Gedao* (Passageway), *Cidu* (Gate Tower), *Tailu* (Great Mound), *Tianchuan* (Celestial Boat), and *Juan She* (Curled Tongue), then turns southward, passing through *Wuche* (Five Chariots), south of *Beihe* (Northern River), entering *Dongjing* (Eastern Well) and *Shuiwei* (Water Level), then southeastward, weaving through *Nanhe* (Southern River), *Guanqiu* (Barrier Mound), *Tiangou* (Celestial Dog), *Tianji* (Celestial Discipline), and *Tianji* (Celestial Millet), vanishing south of the *Qixing* (Seven Stars).\n\nZhang Heng said: The *Jinhan* (Ford of Metal) is the qi of metal. Its root is called the *Shuihan* (Water Ford); when stars are numerous, there is flooding; when few, drought.\n\n**Thunder and Lightning**\nThe *Huainanzi* states: When yin and yang clash and interact, thunder is produced; when they strike violently, lightning is generated.\nThe *Shuyi* records: Lightning is the Heavenly Lord and Jade Maiden playing *touhu* (a game of tossing arrows into a pot), their missed shots causing Heaven to laugh, thus creating lightning.\n\n**Frost and Snow**\nWhen the qi of Heaven and Earth congeals and condenses into dew, it becomes frost; when rainwater freezes, it becomes snow.\n\n**Sleet and Hail**\nFormed when yin and yang coerce each other, embracing yin within yang.\n\n**Rainbows**\nThe unregulated qi of yin and yang, where pure yang assails yin. The male is called *hong* (rainbow), the female *ni* (secondary rainbow).\n\n**Yin and Yang**\nThe *Chunqiu Neishi* states: Fuxi established Heaven and Earth, dividing yin and yang and the Five Phases.\nThe *Shiji: Lishu* records: The Yellow Emperor established the Five Phases, originating the five divisions.\nYing Shao said: They are metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.\nMeng Kang explained: Heaven has four seasons, divided into the Five Phases.\nFire began with Suiren Shi. In high antiquity, people ate fruits, melons, clams, and oysters raw, which harmed their stomachs and intestines, causing many illnesses. The sage then drilled wood to make fire, teaching people to cook raw food into cooked meals. Thus, he was named Suiren Shi. He established platforms for teaching, created markets at noon, and introduced the ways of exchange, through which human sentiments were communicated. The transmitted books of later ages differ: the Grand Historian Sima Guang and Liu Shu record over a hundred clans spanning eighty thousand years, or twelve thousand years, or four generations—none can confirm which is correct.\n\n**The Twelve Branches**\nThe Yellow Emperor established the twelve branches—*zi*, *chou*, and so on—to name the months, and also assigned twelve animals to correspond with them.\n\n**The Origin of Humankind**\nThe *Fengsu Tong* states: Popular tradition says that when Heaven and Earth first opened, there were no people. Nüwa kneaded yellow earth to create humans. Overwhelmed by the task, she drew a rope through the mud and flung it, forming people. Thus, the wealthy and noble are made of yellow earth, while the poor and common are made of rope.\nThe *Huainanzi* says: The Image Emperor gave birth to yin and yang; *Tupian* gave birth to ears and eyes; *Sanglin* gave birth to arms and hands—this is why Nüwa transformed seventy times.\nXu Shen’s commentary: The Image Emperor was an ancient celestial deity who, when creating humans, generated yin and yang. *Tupian* and *Sanglin* are names of spirits. It also says: *Turen* (Sudden People) were born from the sea, *Turen* gave birth to *Ruojun* (Mushroom-like Beings), *Ruojun* gave birth to sages, and sages gave birth to commoners. The ordinary and mediocre descend from commoners, who trace back to the *Turen*—this is the beginning of humankind.\n\n**The Year Star**\nThe planet Jupiter. When it descends among humans, it becomes a noble person. Dongfang Shuo was the essence of Jupiter; from birth, Jupiter did not appear, but when he removed his headscarf and flew away, the next day the Grand Historian reported that the Year Star had appeared—this was the event.\n\n**Yinghuo (Mars)**\nThe Fire Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a child, singing songs and playing games.\n\n**Zhenxing (Saturn)**\nThe Earth Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a woman.\n\n**Taibai (Venus)**\nThe Metal Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a strong man, dwelling in forests and foothills.\n\n**Chenxing (Mercury)**\nThe Water Star. When it descends among humans, it becomes a woman, foretelling good and ill fortune, obscurity and prosperity, blessings and misfortunes—Heaven displays these signs.\n\nWhenever a star descends, it must have a corresponding host.\n\n**The Star of Numinous Efficacy**\nWhen the Han dynasty ruled the world, Emperor Gaozu issued an edict commanding the entire realm to establish shrines to the Star of Numinous Efficacy, primarily for praying for abundant grain.\n\n**Chapter on the Origins and Development of Daoist Teachings**\nThe origins of Daoism trace back to before the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, to the time before the first stirring of the vast chaos. When Heaven and Earth were indistinct and the primordial chaos had just sprouted, there must have been a master of creation present within it, capable of initiating Heaven and Earth and establishing the Three Powers. At that time, when the sun and moon had not yet been born, mountains and rivers had not yet taken shape, and things and principles had not yet manifested, its image was vast and indistinct, as the *Book of Changes* says: \"Before the ultimate, there was already a master governing it.\" Yet it was formless and nameless, remote and unfathomable—ultimately, its name cannot be known. Nevertheless, what is it that gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and the myriad things?",

      "translated_text": "Laozi was the first to reveal its mysteries, encompassing the Two Modes, and thus forcibly named it the *Dao*. That which opened Heaven and Earth and initiated the myriad existents must have had its spirit, yet its name could not be known—so it was forcibly named *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning). Hence arose the name *Yuanshi Tianzun* (Primordial Heavenly Worthy), the progenitor of the opening of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAccording to the *Dongyuan Lingbao Zhen’gao Yuanfu Jing*, its summary states: In ancient times, before Heaven and Earth had divided and yin and yang had separated, within the vast expanse of primordial chaos, boundless and lightless, the Supreme One transformed through the Three Qi to give birth to the Three Realms. By the time of Lord Lao, scriptures and teachings were transmitted, and thereafter the ten thousand norms unfolded. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign beheld the *Eight-Trigram Radiant Scripture* adorning the nine heavens with resplendent brilliance, transcribed it, and from this beginning, transmission commenced. Through the ages to the present, Daoist teachings have thus endured for myriad generations without end.\n\nAll emperors who receive the Mandate of Heaven are called the *Son of Heaven*. Thus, the son serves Heaven as a father. As the *Admonitions of Zhong Hui* states: \"Revere and uphold the Dao of Heaven to eternally preserve the Mandate of Heaven.\" The *Day of Tai Jia* says: \"The former kings heeded the luminous Mandate of Heaven to serve the spirits above and below.\" Therefore, receiving the bright Mandate of Heaven, they encompassed the Four Seas, above to uphold the Dao of Heaven and below to govern human affairs. It is also said: \"Heaven bestows its Mandate,\" and \"to receive Heaven’s Mandate and continue its work\"—all these are acts of serving Heaven. Thus, their halls are called *Fengtian* (Serving Heaven), and their gates *Fengtian*. *Chengtian* (Receiving Heaven) is never spoken without reference to Heaven. Therefore, the Dao as a teaching takes Heaven as its master, and so it is called the *Fengtian Dao* (Way of Serving Heaven), known as Daoism.\n\n**The Upper Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Clarity’s Sacred Realm is Yuanshi Tianzun, also known as Pangu. In the time before the Image Emperor, within the empty and spontaneous void, a hundred thousand layers of primordial qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Non-Being Sage Lord, who was honored with the title *Great Luo Yuanshi Zun*, the Effortless Spontaneous Wondrous Non-Being Supreme Emperor. Later generations called him the *Supreme Dao Treasure*, the ancestor of the myriad qi. In the time before the primordial image had manifested, this was the *Dao giving birth to the One*.\n  - Another account states: Before Pangu, prior to the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, that which gave birth to the Three Powers had a master of creation whose name could not be known—it was also called *Yuanshi*, yet distinct from Pangu.\n\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Earthly Sovereign of Upper Clarity’s True Realm is Lingbao Tianzun, also known as the Earthly Sovereign. In the time before the distant kalpas of *Yankang*, at the beginning of the vast primordial chaos, a hundred thousand layers of true qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Emptiness Sage Lord, who was honored with the title *Jade Palace Great Dao Lord, Wondrous Emptiness Supreme Emperor*. Later generations called him the *Supreme Scripture Treasure*, transmitter of scriptures and teachings, who initiated the norms of the Dao. This is the *One giving birth to the Two*.\n\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Human Sovereign of Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm is Daode Tianzun, also known as the Human Sovereign. In the time of the Crimson Brightness and primordial chaos, a hundred thousand layers of Dao qi coalesced and transformed to give birth to the Wondrous Being Sage Lord, who was honored with the titles *Five Numinous Primordial Elder Lord* and *Hunyuan Supreme Dao Lord*, ancestor of the myriad teachings and Wondrous Being Supreme Emperor. Later generations called him the *Supreme Teacher Treasure*, who promulgated the Dharma and expounded the teachings, bringing the myriad images to completion. This is the *Two giving birth to the Three, and the Three giving birth to the myriad things*.\n\n**The Middle Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Treasure Lord, born from the mysterious qi of Yuanshi, became the Heavenly Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Numinous Treasure Lord, receiving the primordial qi of Yuanshi, became the Earthly Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Divine Treasure Lord, receiving the initial qi of Yuanshi, became the Human Sovereign of the Middle Three Sovereigns.\n\n**The Lower Three Sovereigns**\n- **Heavenly Sovereign**: The Heavenly Sovereign is Taihao Fuxi, who ruled by the virtue of Wood. Born from the mysterious qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Donghua Perfected Azure Heaven Supreme Emperor*. Observing above and examining below, he received the *He Tu* (Yellow River Chart) borne by the dragon-horse and drew the trigrams, establishing images and initiating writing to open the myriad existents.\n- **Earthly Sovereign**: The Earthly Sovereign is Shennong, the Flame Emperor, who ruled by the virtue of Fire. Born from the primordial qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Southern Culmen Vermilion Numinous Cinnabar Heaven Supreme Emperor*. He first tasted the hundred herbs, taught people medicine, and disseminated the hundred grains, initiating the way of food and drink.\n- **Human Sovereign**: The Human Sovereign is the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, who ruled the world by the virtue of Earth. Born from the initial qi of Yuanshi, his title was *Taiyi Yellow Heaven Supreme Emperor*. He first created clothing, palaces, rites, music, writing, boats, carts, and utensils—thus the way of human life, food, and clothing was complete. The Emperor cast the Nine Tripods at Mount Jing, and when the elixir was perfected, a yellow dragon descended with its beard to welcome him. The Emperor ascended to Heaven on clouds and dragons with eighty-one female attendants and seventy-two ministers. According to the *Jade Calendar of the Grand Historian’s Astronomical Observations*, beneath the constellation *Willow* in the sequence of stars, there are seventeen stars of *Xuanyuan*—this is the verification. Thereafter, the Dao of alchemical ascension was transmitted to the world.\n\n**The Supreme Lord Lao**\nAccording to the *Sacred Records*, the Supreme Lord Lao resides above the Great Clarity’s Immortal Realm. He is the ancestor of primordial qi and the root of Heaven and Earth. Within the utmost stillness and emptiness, prior to the Great Beginning and Primordial Simplicity, he is the master who opened Heaven and Earth and gave birth to the myriad things. Governing the cycles of time and directing the movements of qi, he harmonizes essence and unfolds transformation, creating and destroying the Two Modes through countless kalpas. His emanations pervade worlds as numerous as motes of dust, beyond all reckoning. After the opening of Heaven and Earth, observing the world’s shifts between refinement and coarseness, he established teachings in accordance with the times, serving as the imperial teacher of successive dynasties, instituting laws and ordinances. Sometimes he descended from the Nine Heavens, sometimes he transmitted teachings across the Four Seas. From the Three Sovereigns onward, all emperors revered and upheld him. Thus, within the realms of Heaven above and Heaven below, all within the qi of the Dao are the transformations of Lord Lao. He has bestowed countless teachings, universally delivering salvation.",

      "translated_text": "For the people employ it daily yet remain unaware—herein lies the enduring title bestowed by the Most High Lord Lao. Laozi is but a name; he is also called Dan, styled Boyangfu, and was the son of the Perfected One Li Lingfei. In the Zhou dynasty, those of great virtue were all addressed as \"Father,\" as with Confucius being called \"Nifu.\"\n\nYet Lord Lao the Most High is not to be confused with this Laozi. According to the *Annals of Shang*, Laozi was a man of Chu who first manifested at the frontier of birth in the seventeenth year of Yangjia of the Yin dynasty (gengshen, 1073 BCE). From the realm of the Great Clarity, he rode the essence of the sun, transforming into a five-colored pearl of mysterious yellow, large as a pellet. A jade maiden, napping in daylight, swallowed it and conceived. After eighty-one years of gestation, in the ninth year of Wuding (gengchen, 1191 BCE), he emerged from beneath her left armpit, already white-haired, and was named Laozi. Born beneath a plum tree, he took seven steps, one hand pointing to heaven, the other to earth, and declared: \"Within heaven above, heaven below, and the Three Realms, the birth of heaven, the birth of earth, the birth of humanity, and the birth of the myriad things—all are the transformations of the Dao. Thus, only the Dao is supreme.\" Pointing to the plum tree, he said, \"This is my surname,\" and so he was named Er, styled Boyang.\n\nBorn in the ninth year of Wuding (gengchen), he later greatly expounded the Dao. Posterity, witnessing the vastness of his teachings, came to address him as the Most High Lord Lao. *Jun* (\"Lord\") is a title for emperors and sages, while *zi* (\"Master\") is a general term for men. Thus, the Dao expounded by Laozi is none other than the Dao of Lord Lao.\n\nAs for his manifestations and descents before and after, they span countless generations, enabling him to establish models, institute teachings, and exalt the mystic wind for ten thousand ages. Later followers of his teachings also revered him as Lord Lao, though the uninformed mistakenly conflate him with the Lord Lao of the Three Clarities.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, Laozi served as the *zhuxia* scribe under the Earl of the West. In the time of King Wu of Zhou, he became the Keeper of Archives. From the Shang to the Zhou, he lived for nine hundred years before ascending westward to Kunlun. As Sima Qian’s *Records of the Grand Historian* states: \"None knew his end.\" Confucius called him Lao Peng, a worthy minister of Shang. Liu Dian’s annals confirm Laozi was a man of Shang—this is clearly recorded in the Confucian classics.\n\nYet texts that seek to erase the Dao suppress the account of Laozi’s departure from the pass to transform the western lands in the twenty-third year of King Zhao of Zhou. Instead, they shift his birth to the era of King Ding, while the *Comprehensive Mirror* records that by the time of King You, Laozi was already lamenting the Yellow River’s drying—King You being ten generations removed from King Ding, with Laozi’s name appearing across those ten reigns. Such distortions cannot be concealed.\n\nConsider the *Wen Xuan*, compiled by Emperor Wu of Liang and Crown Prince Zhaoming, which cites the stele inscription of Wang Jianqi of Qi to expose the falsehood. This remains an unassailable consensus for all ages, making the sequence of events undeniable. The text states: \"The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the mirror of night’s radiance; the two Mings of Han and Jin jointly inscribed the brilliance of cinnabar and ink.\" The Five Ministers’ commentary notes: \"The two Zhuangs’ birth and the two Mings’ rise are recorded in the Confucian classics, not in Daoist scriptures.\" Emperor Ming of Wei wrote a preface, and successive emperors composed eulogies—Laozi’s birth is documented in the annals, proof beyond dispute.\n\nMoreover, the memorial of the Eight Scholars of Tang further clarifies the matter. How can one deceive others without deceiving the Confucian classics? Alas, the task is arduous indeed!",

      "translated_text": "According to the *Biographies*, in the ninth year of King Zhao of Qin, during the reign of King Nan of Zhou, the Zhou dynasty declined. King Nan surrendered his lands to Qin, and the great Zhou revolution occurred. Laozi, knowing Qin’s brutality and that his Dao would not prevail, ascended Kunlun in the west, and his ultimate fate became unknown—this is the truth.\n\nZhuangzi attained Laozi’s Dao, mastering the virtue of divine illumination, grasping the mysteries of Heaven and Earth, understanding the cycles of destiny, discerning the principles of cosmic ascent and descent, and perceiving the mechanisms of order and chaos in the world. He told the Qi man Yu Zhen: \"In one hundred fifty-seven years, the Zhou’s mandate will end.\" In one hundred seven years, during the jiayin year, Laozi, foreseeing Zhou’s impending fall to Qin and the obstruction of the Dao under Qin, must have gone into seclusion. Laozi was also called Lao Dan, and Qin Yi mourned him, calling out three times before departing—a sign that the Dao had perished. Thus, \"Qin Yi\" was taken as a personal name, with *yi* (佚) formed by adding *shi* (失, \"loss\") to the *ren* (人, \"person\") radical, meaning \"Qin lost the man.\" Hence, it is said, \"Qin Yi mourned him.\" The three cries signified: first, \"My Dao is lost!\"; second, \"What am I to do?\"; and third, \"Qin has lost the man!\" This demonstrates Zhuangzi’s mastery of the divine Dao.\n\nDuring the reign of the First Emperor of Qin, Laozi descended at the Yi Bridge in Xiapi and bestowed the *Su Shu* upon Zhang Liang, naming him the Yellow Stone Master. In the time of Emperor Wen of Han, Laozi descended by the banks of the Shan River, known as the River Master or the Riverbank Sage. The emperor personally sought him, and the Most High granted him the *Daode Jing*. During the reign of Emperor Cheng, Laozi clarified and illuminated the scriptures. In the time of Emperor An, Laozi descended upon Mount Tai, named Jiang Xia, to stabilize the realm. Under Emperor Shun, Laozi descended to bestow the *Mengwei Secret Registers*. During the reign of Emperor Huan, he revealed the *Methods of Nourishing Life* and later the *Methods of Exorcism*. In the time of Emperor Ling, Laozi descended upon Mount Tiantai, transmitting to Ge Xuan the *Upper Clarity*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Great Cavern* scriptures.\n\nIn the era of Chen Liu, King of Wei, Laozi descended in Lintao Prefecture of Longyou, telling Wang Shi: \"The world will soon attain great peace.\" Later, during the reign of Emperor Ming of Wei, Laozi descended upon Mount Song, bestowing upon the Daoist Guan Qianzhi the *Yunzhong Chanting of the New Precepts*. In the time of Emperor Taiwu, Laozi descended upon Mount Song, commanding Qianzhi to confer upon the emperor the title of *Great Peace True Lord*, whereupon the reign era was changed to *Great Peace True Lord*.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, Laozi descended upon Mount Zhongnan, revealing to the mountain recluse Li Chunfeng the omens of the Tang lord’s mandate. In the time of Emperor Gaozu of Tang, Laozi descended upon Yangjiao Mountain, speaking to Ji Shanxing of the Tang’s imperial destiny and foretelling the completion of his enterprise in the fifth month. Under Emperor Gaozong, Laozi descended upon the Hall of Great Ultimate, where princes, ministers, and consorts all paid homage. He also descended at the Yangqing Temple. During the reign of Empress Wu, Laozi descended in Hao Prefecture, warning against her usurpation of the throne, and later at the Spring Brightness Gate.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Xuanzong, Laozi descended in Shu. He also appeared at the thoroughfare of the Five Phoenix Tower, revealing that the sacred talisman lay in Yin Xi’s former residence. Later, he descended upon the Qian Yuan Pavilion, which was then renamed the Pavilion of the Descended Sage. He also descended upon Mount Taibai and in He Prefecture, foretelling the omen of An Lushan’s downfall. Under Emperor Suzong, Laozi descended upon Yunlong Rock in Tonghua Prefecture. During the reign of Emperor Jingzong, he descended at the Grand Clarity Palace.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Huizong of Song, Laozi descended upon Mount Mao. Under Emperor Qinzong, he descended in Luoyang, informing the mother of Li Ruoshui that her son’s loyalty had moved Heaven and Earth, and the Celestial Emperor had elevated him to the ranks of the heavenly officials. Since the Jurchen ravaged China, transforming the Central Kingdom into barbarian lands, Laozi’s manifestations ceased.\n\nFrom this investigation, the traces of Lord Lao’s transformations span myriad kalpas, his ascents and descents unfathomable, his comings and goings beyond measure. Successive dynasties honored him with titles and enfeoffments, bequeathing his teachings to emperors and kings for endless propagation—this is the true account of Laozi.\n\nHis teachings were transmitted to Zhang Daoling of Han, who became the Celestial Master, acting as Heaven’s emissary to propagate the Dao. The Celestial Master, the Boundless, Lofty, and Illustrious Great Emperor—his surname was Zhang, personal name Daoling, courtesy name Fuhan. A native of Fengyi in Pei, his lineage traced back to the Ji clan. The fifth son of Xuanyuan’s son Qingyang, named Hui, served as Bow Minister, inventing the bow and arrow and presiding over the worship of the Bow Star. His descendants held this office for generations and were granted the surname Zhang.\n\nDuring the reign of King Xuan of Zhou, there was Zhang Zhong. Eight generations later, his descendant served as minister to Marquis Zhao of Han. His line continued with Ping, who fathered Liang, courtesy name Zifang. Liang served Han and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Liu. His son Buyi, Buyi’s younger son Gao, Gao’s son Tong, Tong’s son Wuwang, Wuwang’s son Liren, Liren’s son Jue, Jue’s son Qi, and Qi’s son Dashun—Daoling was Dashun’s eldest son.\n\nIn the tenth year of *Jianwu* (jiayin), the fifteenth day of the first month, he was born on Mount Tianmu in Wu. In adulthood, he entered Mount Longhu, compounded the Nine Heavens’ divine elixir, and received from the Most High the scriptures, registers, and secret texts, becoming the founder of the Mysterious Teachings.\n\nThe *True Records* in the *Daoist Canon* and *Divine Pivot* state: The Dark Emperor was once the son of Shaodian, who married the daughter of Mount Shu’s clan and fathered Gaoyang, known by his virtue as Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu’s father dwelled in the Weak Water region, his neck bearing the marks of pottery from the Seven Rivers’ ford—thus was he called the Dark Emperor. Wielding the trust of the myriad spirits, overseeing the host of deities to guide all things, he commanded the hundred qi, summoned thunder and lightning. Thereupon, he rode the chariot of primordial unity.",

All beings in motion and stillness, all spirits great and small, all within the light of sun and moon—none were not under his sway. Traversing the four quarters of the earth, circling beyond the eight directions, wherever there were mountains of terraced towers or mounds of yin palaces, he transported the stones of Anxi to seal and fill them. He cast the bronze of Mount Yu into sacred tripods, each offering one to the divine peaks of Dongshan—not merely Mount Juqu alone.\n\nThis is what is called the Dark Emperor, as recorded in the *True Records*.\n\nMoreover, according to ancient histories: In antiquity, the people and spirits followed separate callings. When Shaohao’s reign declined, the Nine Li disrupted virtue, and people and spirits became intermixed, their distinctions lost. Zhuanxu then commanded Chong, the Southern Regulator, to govern the heavens and oversee the spirits, and Li, the Northern Regulator, to govern the earth and oversee the people, restoring the old order so that none encroached upon the other. He first established the calendar, taking the first month of spring as its beginning—thus was he the founder of the calendar.\n\nAs the ages receded, though the *Daoist Canon* was gnawed by barbarian fires, the *True Records* still preserved its accounts at the margins, for even the Dao of Heaven has its abiding presence.\n\nFurthermore, the ancient titles of Yellow Emperor and Dark Emperor refer to Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor, and Zhuanxu, the Dark Emperor.\n\n**The Old Man Star of the Southern Pole**\nGonggong’s son, Gou Longshuang, attained the Dao and lived for over a thousand years. Ascending to dwell at the Southern Pole as the Longevity Star, it lies 143 degrees from the pole, entering the Well Mansion at three degrees, south of the Bow and Arrow stars—also called the Southern Pole. It regularly appears at dawn during the autumn equinox in the *bing* direction and sets at dusk during the spring equinox in the *ding* direction. It is customarily observed at the southern suburbs during the autumn equinox; when bright and large, it presides over longevity and prosperity. It governs the lifespan of all living people under Heaven.\n\nSince the Northern Pole resides in *chou-gen*, the Southern Pole lies in *wei-kun*. The Southern Pole sinks 36 degrees below the earth, where it cannot be seen. Thus, its spirit emerges from the earth to appear in the south, called the Old Man of the Southern Pole. Yet its emergence is not always complete, so its appearances are irregular. When seen, it is auspicious, its power and position equal in majesty. Aligned with the Central Dipper, it assists the Supreme Emperor. Though south of the Well Mansion, it does not belong to its sequence. It is regularly sacrificed to on the second day of the second month with great offerings, and on the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month, it descends to the human realm to extend the lives of the virtuous—so records the *Treatise on Astronomy*.\n\n**Southern Lineage**\nBeginning in the Han, it was initiated by Lutang Zhao Sheng, Huayang Li Ya, Zhongli Quan, Lü Yan, Liu Haichan, Zhang Ziyang, Chongzhao Wang, Ma Ziran, Shi Xinglin, Xue Daoguang, Chen Niewan, and Bai Yuchan.\n\n**Northern Lineage**\nBeginning in the Song, Wang Chongyang journeyed to the Eastern Sea and saw seven golden lotuses in the sea. His master said: \"Here, seven perfected beings shall emerge.\" Thereupon, he ordained Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, and Sun—the Seven Perfected.

Their decree proclaimed: 'Whoever dares to keep even a fragment or a single character shall not be pardoned.' From then on, the *Daoist Canon* of China was severed. This occurred when the Song faced collapse, the barbarians ravaged China, light gave way to darkness, and the obscure encroached upon the bright—such was the cause.\n\nFrom the Jingkang era, when Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were captured in the north, during the chaos of the Jurchen Jin’s invasion of China, the Qiang barbarians arose and destroyed the great Daoist books of China. Over the 272 years of the Yuan dynasty, they produced ninety volumes of heretical texts, falsely attributing them to Tang figures like Daoxuan, Daoshi, Xuanyi, Zhisheng, and Falin, thereby eradicating China’s Dao. Their *Record of Exposing Falsehoods* states: 'It would make the Jade Emperor of the Great Luo tremble in fear within the Nine Heavens, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning lose his gall atop the Three Clarities, the Lords of the Myriad Heavens blush in shame, and the Immortals of the Nine Palaces grovel in humiliation. They slander the Heavenly Emperor, obliterate Confucius and Laozi, and vilify the Yellow Emperor’s deeds—words too numerous to record.'\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor was the founding ancestor who established the ultimate under heaven, and Laozi was the ancestor of the Tang. How could people of that time destroy the ancestor of their own sovereign? How could the Chinese people destroy the Dao of China? In truth, these were the works of the Khitan Liao, Jurchen Jin, and Mongol Yuan. During the Duanping era of Emperor Lizong of the Song, when the barbarian bandits raided the borders, one or two volumes of these books were obtained. The emperor, upon reading them, sighed: 'Even with a hundred thousand volumes, the superiority or inferiority of China’s Dao versus that of the barbarians is evident without debate.' Thus, the titles of the heretical books that destroyed the Dao are recorded below:\n\n*The Veritable Record of the Balance Between Buddhism and Daoism* (4 scrolls),\n*The Continued Balance Between Buddhism and Daoism* (1 scroll),\n*The Treatise on Discerning Orthodoxy* (3 scrolls),\n*The Treatise on Debating Orthodoxy* (8 scrolls),\n*The Treatise on Destroying Heresy* (2 scrolls)...\"",
      "overlap_context": "aoist Canon* comprised 1,881,500 scrolls. After the barbarian fires, only 5,134 scrolls remain.\n\nIn the time of the Jin and Mongol barbarians, during the decline of the Song, a Qiang man named Huyan Mai, envious that the *Daoist Canon* contained such texts as the *Scripture of the Moon Hidden in Heaven*, the *Jade Latitude*, and the *Nine Heavens*—all supremely secret books of the highest heavens—conspired with the barbarian ruler Möngke Khan of the Mongols to have them all burned and destroyed.",

Who lacks a heart of filial piety? One must rely on the scriptures of posthumous cultivation. By submitting secret petitions on their behalf and presenting them to the netherworld bureaus, the departed are instantly illumined by returning light, enabling them to ascend to perfection and receive deliverance. With a single heart of filial devotion, nine generations of ancestors ascend as immortals.\n\n*The Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Returning Chariot and Completing the Dao Secret Register* (1 set, 8 scrolls);\n*The Numinous Treasure Middle Alliance Secret Register* (1 set, 8 scrolls).\nThese two registers are jade tablets of Jade Clarity and jasper texts of the Great Empyrean, containing inner decrees of esoteric speech and secret words of the Central Yellow.

Amid misty clouds and golden crucibles, the elixir is perfected, and one whistles in transcendence. The sun and moon of the Nine Empyreans are attained; emptiness is embraced, and the One is held. One strides through the void and ascends the heavens.

Those who cultivate with unwavering resolve receive unfailing responses.\n\n*The Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Unified Perfected Flying Demons and Transforming Flying Immortals Upper Yang Five Thunder Secret Register* (1 set).\nThis register encompasses the subtleties of the Jade Pivot and wields the divine efficacy of the Golden Tiger.

Those who wear it are protected by numinous officials and celestial soldiers. Any impending celestial punishments or netherworld retributions are absolved by its grace, rendering all pure and unblemished.

The earth harbors the prison of the Blood Lake, renowned in scriptures as the \"Stone of Shame.\" All women in the world face the trials of childbirth; some bear the fruits of past-life evil, while others suffer present-life enmities. In pregnancy, they may harm the fetus, their pearls shattered like bees, their bodies departing the yang world, their souls cast into the yin pool. If devout women early awaken to benevolence and personally receive these precious registers—or if filial sons and obedient descendants do so on their behalf—their names are inscribed in the jade registers, their records erased from the dark bureaus. In their present lives, fortune and longevity increase; in the netherworld hereafter, they wander freely without hindrance.

      "translated_text": "If one’s merits are abundant but one does not wish to accept promotion, one may instead be reassigned to serve as a general or officer.\n\n1. If within a year one has neither merits nor faults, one shall remain in one’s current position as before.\n\n2. If within a year one has both merits and faults, these may only offset one another.\n\n3. If one idly wastes time, accumulating faults without merits, and lacks the conduct of a general or officer, how can one privately evade self-indictment and scrutiny? Such a person ought to indict themselves—how could they presume to advance?\n\n4. Saving lives is called *merit*; accumulating virtue is called *conduct*. What is termed *one merit* is roughly equivalent to saving one hundred persons. Calculated by fractions: saving ten or more persons may be counted as one-tenth of a merit. Extending the nation’s lifespan or resolving great crises—matters concerning salvation and relief—count as two merits. Praying for clear skies or rain on behalf of the people, driving away locusts, alleviating plagues, or averting floods and fires to benefit the people and all living things counts as one merit. If malevolent spirits or entangled curses manifest visibly and are widely resented, and one eradicates their root, this counts as one merit. For other cases involving one-tenth of a merit or more, the weight is assessed and converted accordingly. Performing rituals to eliminate misfortune or invoke blessings, completing jiao offerings, refining souls to resolve grievances, petitioning for the people’s lives, or achieving clear karmic retribution with verifiable benefits to salvation counts as one merit. For other cases, the weight is assessed and converted accordingly. Saving a woman in difficult childbirth, ensuring the survival of both mother and child, counts as one merit. If either mother or child is lost, this is calculated from one-tenth of a merit upward. Matters not fully enumerated here are to be assessed and converted according to reason.\n\n5. Concurrently serving in the Central Heaven Court, Supreme Ultimate Court, Demon-Quelling Court, Yellow Register Court, Supreme Clarity Court, Purple Court, and Southern Palace, as well as the Refinement-Receiving Bureau and other courts:\n   - From the ninth to the seventh rank, one is titled *Concurrently Supervising Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - From the sixth to the fourth rank, one is titled *Concurrently Overseeing Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - From the third to the second rank, one is titled *Concurrently Directing Affairs of [Court Name]*.\n   - Those of the ninth rank and above concurrently serve as Refinement-Receiving Officers of the Southern Palace.\n   - Those of the fifth rank and above concurrently serve as Directors of the Yellow Register Court.\n   - From the ninth to the seventh rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Affairs of the Three Realms’ Spirits and Demons*.\n   - From the eighth to the seventh rank, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the Affairs of the Three Realms’ Spirits and Demons*.\n   - From the seventh rank upward, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the City God Bureau*.\n   - From the sixth rank upward, one additionally holds the office of *Overseeing the City God Bureaus of the Nine Provinces*.\n   - At the fifth rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Soldiers and Horses of the Sacred Mountains’ City Gods*.\n   - At the fourth rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commander-in-Chief of the Soldiers and Horses of the Sacred Mountains and Rivers*.\n   - At the third rank, one additionally holds the office of *Commanding the Soldiers and Horses of the Nine Heavens*.\n   - At the second rank, one additionally holds the office of *Investigating the Spirits and Demons of the Three Realms and Adjudicating the Affairs of Grotto-Heavens, Blessed Lands, and Purification Halls*.\n\n6. When a beginning adept receives Daoist methods, they must first receive the register, allowing them to be appointed to the rank of adjunct ninth rank. Those who have not received the register may not be appointed to the regular ninth rank.\n\n7. In performing zhai and jiao rituals, even if one holds another rank, if one has not received the register and lacks the *Dugong* register or the position of *Jijiu*, one’s sincerity will not reach the gods. Those of the seventh rank and above who have not received the *Mengwei* register may not be appointed. Those of the fifth rank and above who have not received the *Dongyuan* register may not be appointed. Those of the fourth rank and above who have not received the *Shenxiao* register may not be appointed. Those of the third rank and above who have not received the *Great Cavern* register may not be appointed.\n\n8. Methods and registers are mutually dependent and must not conflict. The *Tianxin* method is suited to the *Dugong* register. The *Five Thunders* method is suited to the *Highest Divine Empyrean* register. The *Lingbao* method is suited to the *Purple Void Yang Light* register and the *Lingbao Middle Alliance* register. The *Tianpeng* method is suited to the *Northern Emperor Demon-Quelling* register. The *Tianshu* method is suited to the *Highest Clarity Returning Chariot and Dipper* register. The *Zhao Hou Southern* method has its own proper register, suited to the *Zhao Hou* register.\n\n9. The *Tianxin* method is the ancestor of all methods. The *Dugong* and *Mengwei* registers encompass twenty-four ranks and should be received first.\n\n10. The Southern and Northern Courts are called the *civil ranks*, while the Thunder Bureau is called the *military ranks*. For beginning adepts, it is easier to enter the military ranks from the civil ranks, but difficult to enter the civil ranks from the military ranks.\n\n11. The *Five Thunders* are:\n    - *Heavenly Thunder*, the bureau of the heavens’ attendants;\n    - *Divine Thunder*, the command center of thunder and lightning;\n    - *Dragon Thunder*, the guardian of the sea’s treasuries;\n    - *Water Thunder*, the bureau governing rain and moisture;\n    - *Community Thunder*, the spirits of famous mountains and great rivers who receive blood sacrifices through loyalty.\n    These serve the Emperor above and attend to the people’s affairs below, and may be commanded accordingly.\n\n12. The *Four Bureaus* are:\n    Within the Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court, there is the *True Lord of the Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court*, who presides over thunder and specifically governs the *Jade Pivot Five Thunders Court*. Additionally, there is the *Thunder Bureau*, which administers punishments, and the *Penglai Water Bureau*, which governs water and moisture. These three bureaus are all under the jurisdiction of the *Jade Treasury’s Five Thunders Envoys’ Court*. All cases of exoneration and imprisonment must not be presumptuously handled by the Pivot Bureau but are instead sent to the *Thunder Bureau*. The quota of the *Five Thunders Envoys’ Court* must not be arbitrarily used.\n\n13. When a beginning adept receives methods, they must seek a master of the current generation who is pure in conduct and upright in learning, and pay homage to them. The master, too, should select disciples of true capacity and only then transmit the teachings. First, one must summon guarantor officials and guarantor allies, present a sincere petition, and obtain clear guarantees before proceeding according to the proper forms. Memorials are submitted, and upon approval, one is ordained and granted the *Divine Empyrean Illumination Certificate*, the *Title Deed*, and other documents. Next, a jiao ritual is held to thank the master, and the methods are received and brought back to the altar.\n\n14. If within a year one has merits warranting promotion according to seniority, one must summon fellow method officials of the same rank to provide guarantees, submit a petition to the ordination master as before, and memorialize for approval and transmission. This must not be treated with negligence or irreverence. If the master is not of upright learning and the disciple is hasty and reckless, their names may not be recorded in the immortal registers, and the heavens will not attend to them. Only wayward shrines and lesser ghosts will falsely claim their names, inviting disasters. The true bureaus will investigate, and the resulting offenses will not be light.\n\n15. When a beginning adept receives methods and accumulates merits leading to promotion, they must still report to their master for transmission. They must provide a detailed account of the beginning and end of their progress, including the year and month, the names of their master and guarantors, the methods they practice, the merits they have accumulated, and the rank to which they are to be promoted. A petition is submitted to the *Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity at the Mysterious Altar*, who memorializes and issues the certificate. Only then will their name be recorded in the Jade Registers, and gods and humans will revere them. If one presumptuously exaggerates their merits, boasts to the world, or fails to report to a master and instead fraudulently fabricates ranks, falsely claiming promotions, or if one receives methods without proper transmission from a master and recklessly writes down official ranks, treating them as empty formalities, this will mislead the Mysterious Altar. What efficacy could there be in memorializing and issuing certificates under such circumstances?",

Only those with lofty merits and renowned conduct, whose names are recorded in the immortal registers, may attain them; such ranks cannot be described by mere grade.\n\n2. Within the aforementioned years, if one’s merits in a given year are abundant, one may be promoted twice in that year, but one may not exceed two ranks in a single promotion.",

      "translated_text": "Discipline is clear as daylight—heed it! Be vigilant!\n\n**Chapter on Revolving Creation and Transformation**\n**The Three-Five Flying Steps and Ranks of the Dang**\n\nThe Master said: The secrets of the Three-Five—how could they be easily known? From One, Two arises; from Two, Three is born. For the Three Qi divide and the Three Lights shine; the Three Lights shine and the Three Powers are complete.\n\nFrom the Great Ultimate, the Two Modes emerge; from the Two Modes, the Four Images arise. When the Four Images are complete, the Five Phases are whole; when the Five Phases are whole, the Five Stars shine; when the Five Stars shine, the Five Peaks stand firm. Thus, in the Dao they become the Three Pure Ones; in the world, the Three Powers; among spirits, the Three Origins; in humans, they correspond to the Three Sections. Again, in the Dao they are the Five Elders; in Heaven, the Five Stars; on Earth, the Five Peaks; in humans, the Five Viscera.\n\nHumans possess Heaven and Earth, their forms divided into yin and yang. The Dao of qi is complete within the body, yet if one cannot nurture the Three Fields to gestate refinement or allow the Five Viscera to receive the numinous, then one begins to drift far from the Dao.\n\nThose who cultivate it gather treasures in the Three Fields and summon the Five Qi to return to the Origin. The po is restrained, the hun is bound, spirit is whole, and qi is full—this is the immortal’s Way of prizing life. Those who do not cultivate it allow the Three Hun to become the Three Corpses, the Five Qi to become the Five Thieves, and the Five Thieves to become the Five Sufferings—this is the ghostly Way of prizing death.\n\nThus, among all things between Heaven and Earth, humans are the most numinous. Therefore, every gesture of hand and step of foot is none other than an alignment with the Real. The method of stepping the Dang arises from this.\n\nThe stepping of the Dang is the essence of flying Heaven and the spirit of treading Earth, the true movement of humans. It causes the Three Powers to unite in virtue and the Nine Qi to merge as one. All ghosts and spirits revolve with Heaven and Earth. Each step and point, each turn and revolution, is complete within the workings of creation. The numinous is at one’s left.\n\nThus, one step resembles the Great Ultimate; two steps, the Two Modes; three steps, the Three Powers; four steps, the Four Seasons; five steps, the Five Phases; six steps, the Six Pitch Pipes; seven steps, the Seven Stars; eight steps, the Eight Trigrams; nine steps, the Nine Numinous Ones—this is the origin of the ten thousand steps.\n\nThe Master said: The method of the Yu Step has lost its authenticity in the world. Though many can speak of it, few truly attain it. Even those who attain it do not practice it, and those who practice it do so without devotion—thus, its efficacy is rarely manifest.\n\nThe Huoluo Dipper practiced in the world today is the pivotal essence of the Three-Five Yu Step, the comprehensive number of the intersecting River Chart. How could it be dismissed as ordinary? Yet due to errors in transmission, it cannot transform or communicate with the numinous. I now correct these errors to transmit its true form.\n\nThe Master said: One Qi divides into Three, named Mysterious, Origin, and Beginning. When the Three Qi divide, the Three Powers are established. The human body mirrors this: the pure and turbid form is divided into Three Sections, each with its own spirit—also called the Three Fields. Each field holds its treasure. Thus, from One comes Two, from Two comes Three—this is the true within our bodies. Together, they are called the Three Origins.\n\n*Origin* means greatness, primacy. Thus, the *Qian* hexagram in the *Book of Changes* calls the Origin \"the chief of goodness.\"\n\nThe Master said: The spirits of the Two and Five penetrate Heaven and Earth, yet all return to the single body. In their operation, there are methods of generation, conquest, restraint, and submission. When petitioning or offering thanks, one employs the generative cycle; when restraining or driving away, one employs the conquest cycle.\n\nWhenever stepping the Dang, first summon the spirits of the Three Origins and Five Phases, then proceed with the steps.\n\nThe Master said: The ancestral qi of the Five Phases is called the Five Elders. *Elder* means origin, ancestor. Drawing the essence of the Five Elders forms the Five Stars; the flowing essence of the Five Stars congeals to form the Five Peaks. Matched to the human body, they are called the Five Viscera. Above, they correspond to the Five Stars; in the center, to the Five Peaks—thus, the spirits reside within them.\n\nThe Five Phases and Five Virtues generate one another: Wood generates Fire. The Five Phases and Five Qi conquer one another: Metal conquers Wood.\n\n**Upper Origin Dang (Attributed to Heaven)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Upper Origin Dang:*\nStep the essence of Heaven, command the ten thousand spirits.\nThe Upper Origin shields my body.\nGeneral Tanghong, assist my true qi,\nrepel and subdue demonic spirits.\nWhoever dares harm me,\nlet them suffer in their own person.\nMay evil demons, upon seeing me,\nbe reduced to fine dust.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\n**Middle Origin Dang (Attributed to Humans)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Middle Origin Dang:*\nStep the essence of humans, strengthen yang to disperse yin.\nFortify my Three Hun,\nexterminate ghosts and banish essences.\nMisfortune cannot reach me,\ncalamity cannot invade.\nThe Middle Origin conceals my form.\nGeneral Geyong, lead a thousand, ten thousand troops\nto guard my body.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\n**Lower Origin Dang (Attributed to Earth)**\n*Incantation for Stepping the Lower Origin Dang:*\nTread the spirit of Earth, secure the human Dao.\nHeaven revolves, Earth turns,\nabove, the *Kui*; below, the *Qian*.\nYin closes, yang opens,\ntrue qi flows ceaselessly.\nGhosts cannot harm me,\nhumans cannot injure me.\nHeaven is my canopy,\nEarth is my support.\nWhoever dares harm me,\nbe pressed and sent to the *Kui* Dang.\nThe Lower Origin hides my form.\nGeneral Zhouwu, follow wherever I go,\nhasten to protect this true one.\n*Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*\n\nThe Master said: When restraining fierce evil or overcoming disasters and dangers, first step the Upper Origin Dang. After completing the sequence in order, enter the Middle Origin Dang, then transform into the Lower Origin Dang. If restraining fierce evil, further transform into the Five Phases Conquest Dang to subdue Heavenly Dragons and ghosts. Spirits will respond to the heart’s summons—nothing will fail. Guard this secret!\n\n**Five Phases Conquest Dang**\nThe Master said: When restraining fierce evil or overcoming disasters and dangers, step this Dang. For example, Water can conquer Fire—thus, one applies the method as needed. To restrain fire calamities, step Metal and Water to control Fire. The rest follow this pattern. If later students are unclear, simply complete the stepping of the Dang without additions or omissions.\n\n*Incantation:*\nThe Five Phases mutually destroy:\nEarth and Water sever each other;\nWater and Fire extinguish each other;\nMetal and Wood assault each other.\nMay ghosts and demons, upon seeing me—?",

      "translated_text": "The **Golden Light Encompassing Dang**\n\nThe Master said: Whenever ascending the altar to perform rituals, visualize yourself as the Divine Yu. Recite the incantation while forming the mudra, beginning with the *Jade Script* and ending with the *Noon Script*. Tread the Dang, traversing all within Heaven and Earth. Golden light encircles your body, transforming your form to subdue demons. Utter the sounds of *tiyin* and *zhali*. Envision before you a sphere of purple *qi*; soon, green *qi* descends from Heaven, piercing the purple *qi*. Suddenly, amidst the clouds, golden palaces and towering pavilions appear. Bow thrice in reverence, offering obeisance, and present your petition according to ritual.\n\nWhen treading this Dang, recite the *Golden Light Incantation*, one step for each phrase. Upon completing the incantation, proceed with the Dipper Dang.\n\n**The Yu King’s Three Steps and Nine Traces**\nThe Master said: Visualize yourself standing atop Yu’s Dragon Gate excavation, amidst wind, thunder, and cloud *qi*, bearing the Mandate of the Supreme Emperor. With the left hand forming the Jade Mudra and the right wielding the Sword Mudra, summon and dispatch the myriad spirits as the matter requires.\n\n**The Mudra Technique**\nThe Master said: Mudras serve to commune with the true and subdue the perverse. Each mudra differs; the Dang mudras number over seven hundred, though few are now in use. The four cardinal directions and eight trigrams are marked by counting the joints of the four fingers, totaling twelve points corresponding to the twelve earthly branches. Within these, the Eight Trigrams, Seven Stars, Nine Palaces, and Three Terraces each govern their respective affairs. To simplify: the central joint of the middle finger is the *Jade Clarity Mudra*, while its left side is the *Northern Emperor Mudra*, known as the *Great Slaying Script*. These two mudras govern all matters across the Three Realms—employ them accordingly.\n\n**The Teeth-Tapping Technique**\nThe Master said: Tapping the teeth gathers the true and assembles the spirits. When a person’s *qi* scatters and the heart’s *qi* dissipates, true *qi* fails to respond—thus it must be gathered.\n\nTapping the teeth stirs the Gate of Heaven, summoning the spirit-*qi*. The left tap sounds the *Heavenly Bell*, the right the *Heavenly Chime*. For subduing, driving away, or descending spirits, use the front teeth—four above and four below, eight in total—tapping them together to sound the *Dharma Drum*, thereby communing with the true and reaching the Supreme Emperor. For audience petitions, tap thrice above and below, totaling twenty-four strikes, known as sounding the *Dharma Drum*. Remember this always.\n\n**The Entering the Chamber Technique**\nThe Master said: When establishing an altar, the chamber’s entrance lies in the southeast, the *Xun* earthly gate. If entering during a *jing* ritual, treat the *jing* gate as the entrance. Step through here, first tapping the teeth twelve times at *Xun*, bowing thrice in the heart, then advancing the right foot followed by the left. First visualize the Four Attendant Heralds and the Two Dragon-Tiger Lords standing to your left and right. Next, envision the chamber filled with blue, yellow, and white clouds of *qi*, then see the incense smoke form five colors, rising straight to the Golden Gates. Bow nine times—or simply in the heart, if preferred.\n\n**The Incense-Burning Technique**\nThe Master said: Enter the chamber with the left foot first, never glancing back—lest you invite misfortune. Maintain a single-minded stillness. Visualize the Azure Dragon to your left, the White Tiger to your right, the Vermilion Bird before you, and the Dark Warrior behind. The Heralds and Jade Maidens ride the five-colored *qi* of your five viscera, ascending straight to the Three Heavens. Focus your thoughts without obstruction. When you feel a gentle warmth within, it is the true *qi* uniting with virtue.\n\nWhen burning incense, ensure a blazing fire. Then, pinch the incense and place it in the censer—this is called *offering incense*. *Feng* means abundance; let the smoke rise in a single, vigorous ascent, reaching without delay. If the incense smoke frays or the flame weakens, it cannot transcend to the true or reach the numinous.\n\nAlways hold the incense in the left hand—the *rubbing hand*. The right hand is impure and must not touch the incense.\n\n**The Incense-Petition Technique**\nThe Master said: Maintain a heart free of external distractions and inner杂念. See only true light and Brahman *qi* before you, with purple and azure *qi* filling the space ahead and behind. Cast aside all thoughts, ascending directly to the Ten Directions. Offer incense to the Ten Directions, and true *qi* descends to meet the incense smoke within the *qi*. Vaguely perceive the boundless true immortals and celestial lords arriving from all directions amidst fine rain and dense mist. Then, at the ritual table, see the incense transform into five colors. The Heralds and Talisman Clerks appear in the void. Your body seems to ascend to the Three Heavens, where you personally behold the Three Pure Ones and the Jade Emperor. Tap your teeth thirty-six times, swallow the saliva nine times, then proceed according to the ritual.\n\nThe Master said: Beginners in the Dao are prone to wandering thoughts and doubts; do not burden them with elaborate texts. Within simplicity, observe and contemplate—the subtlety lies beyond words. If one can advance in rank and ascend the mystery, from here to inheriting the lineage, attaining immortality is not difficult.\n\n**The Petition-Presenting Technique**\nThe Master said: When presenting petitions, healing illnesses, or deploying talismans, first visualize the Primordial Beginning in the Upper Cinnabar Field, the Dao Lord in the Middle Cinnabar Field, and the Old Lord in the Lower Cinnabar Field. Then visualize the Three Palaces and Three Perfected Ones, each in your likeness. First, envision the Lord within the Lower Cinnabar Field merging with the Dao Lord in your heart, standing together in your crown as if seated in a golden palace. Your body kneels in obeisance as you secretly present your petition—immediate resonance will follow.\n\n**The Audience with the True and Emperor-Visiting Technique**\nThe Master said: A humble novice is but an ordinary person, with desires for food, drink, and sensuality no different from others. Yet now, having received the registers and practiced the methods, you are called a Dharma Master, donning starry crowns and cloud-patterned robes, aspiring to resemble immortals and sages. But if your heart remains unsettled, your *qi* restless, still entangled in lust and impurity, tainted by filth and stench—how can you hope to visit the Supreme Emperor beyond the void? Without the method of clarity and brightness, you cannot evoke resonance but will instead incur transgressions.\n\nThus it is said: Even an evil person, through purification, fasting, and bathing, may serve the Supreme Emperor. This is the meaning.\n\n**The Fasting and Offering Audience Technique**\nThe Master said: During offerings and audience rituals, adhere to the prescribed forms, merging body and mind. Constantly visualize the Golden Gates high above the vault of Heaven, unaware of standing on the altar, sensing only that you are amidst the Nine Empyreans. In recitation and visualization, sever all delusive thoughts.",

Sustain this visualization until you feel the true *qi* suffusing your fontanel, a subtle warmth radiating inward. This is the method for daily practice.\n\nWhen matters arise, employ the same visualization and align your body, suddenly finding yourself kneeling before the Heavenly Worthy. Silently offer your prayers, and nothing will fail to be answered. These are the essential instructions of the lineage masters, passed down to guide disciples in their first steps. This is the wondrous technique for ascending the hall and entering the inner chamber—guard it well, and do not reveal it to the uninitiated.\n\n**The Talisman-Writing Technique**\nThe Master said: In writing talismans, the key is to settle the mind and exclude all external thoughts. The brushstrokes must be precise yet fluid, so that when you begin, spirit does not wander nor *qi* scatter. If you recite the text while writing, the talisman may take form, but if your eyes shift, intent follows, and the mind strays with the brush, resonance will not arise.\n\nThe mind must unite with the talisman, the talisman with the mind.

      "translated_text": "The Master said: The Jade Hall is the esoteric core of the Celestial Heart Ancestral Teachings, the wellspring from which all methods flow, the revered path of the Three Realms. Since the time of the Celestial Master of Han, it has been transmitted solely as a mind-seal, devoid of extraneous techniques—nothing but orthodoxy. Orthodoxy means the absence of deviation. Heaven covers and nurtures through orthodoxy; Earth bears and sustains through orthodoxy; *qi* circulates through orthodoxy; ghosts and spirits are commanded through orthodoxy. When a person rectifies the heart, the body follows; if the heart is not rectified, deviant thoughts arise, the Six Desires stir, and one degenerates into a beast or sinks into the realm of hungry ghosts. Those who, in this world, fail to uphold orthodoxy become treacherous and perverse, rebelling against the Dao, and are barred from the domain of true immortals. The emergence of the great teachings of the Jade Hall originates with the Orthodox Celestial Master. Orthodoxy precludes deviation; unity precludes duality.\n\nThose who inherit this teaching are divided into five ranks. For those in the world who weary of dust and aspire to truth, upon first entering the altar, they receive the *Ten Scrolls of the Orthodox Celestial Heart Method*. After practicing for three years, free from disrespect toward the master or contempt for the Dao, and without slackening in diligence, they may proceed to the next stage, receiving the seventh rank. If their conduct remains faultless, they advance two ranks, don the seal of the Jade Altar’s orthodox rank, and are permitted to ascend the High Flight to the Jade Capital. After twelve years of practice, if proven not to be among the common rabble of markets and streets, nor of the ranks of servants, menials, corrupt clerks, or oppressive officials, and if not merely dull-witted parasites in temples and abbeys, they may be entrusted with the supreme宗旨, the *Twenty-Four Ranks*, the *Three Ascents Precious Registers*, and the seals of the *Three Sceneries of the Jade Hall*. The *Jade Scenery Ascending the Hall Seal* designates them as lineage-holding branch masters. \"Branch\" signifies the division into separate streams. This transmission is not limited in number but is restricted to gentlemen of official rank, scholars of Confucian or Mohist refinement—all may bear and uphold it. It is forbidden to transmit it to the common Daoist clergy of the marketplace.\n\nIn this age, many among the Daoist clergy are those who, destitute and forsaken, rejected by the four classes of society, turn to donning the yellow cap and entering the Dao not out of sincere devotion but out of desperation. Such individuals may treat the sacred texts with disdain, lose the secret teachings, and incur unforgivable transgressions. The above describes the fourth rank. Transmission and ordination.",

      "translated_text": "For the fifth-rank transmission lineage, the lineage-holding master transmits solely to one rightful successor. They confer the Twenty-Four Forbidden Scriptures in jade script, the *Xuanhe Sword for Beheading Demons*, and the *Seal for Summoning Perfected Beings and Subduing Demons*. Only after thirty years may this transmission be passed on. Now, with the initial rank and first stage of ordination, its texts are concise, its practice simplified—every person may uphold it, and all may gaze in aspiration toward the Jade Hall.\n\nOn the day of ascending the altar, the disciple advances with measured steps, bearing the pledge of faith and oath. Even if one holds high office or noble rank, they must not slight the Perfected or disdain the Dao. They shall bow nine times before the altar of covenant to receive the transmission.\n\nFrom this moment, they bear the mystery of the Dao and must not contravene the master’s instructions. Henceforth, they ascend the path of immortals and enter the gate of the Inaudible and Invisible. Should one fail to heed this teaching, transmitting recklessly or receiving lightly, the Three Officials shall record their transgressions, the Four Administrators shall tally their faults, and the Heavenly Bureau shall pronounce judgment. Their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer retribution in the trials of the Wind-Knife, their souls bound to eternal night. Ten thousand repentances cannot cleanse this, a thousand Perfected Ones cannot redeem it. Thus, transmission must be conducted with utmost care.\n\nThe practice of the initial rank’s teachings is transmitted orally and sealed in the heart, comprising twenty matters:\n\n1. Each day, cultivate with reverence and diligence, gradually distancing oneself from worldly affairs. One must not mingle with the dust of the vulgar or engage in frivolous pursuits. Over time, as the precepts and conduct become radiant, one may proceed to the next stage of transmission.\n\n2. Preserve and refine the *qi* of the Radiant Yang and Conjoined Yin. Devote oneself to its circulation, and in time, true *qi* will suffuse the body. Through exhalation and inhalation, one becomes Perfected, and without conscious effort, ghosts and spirits will stand in awe.\n\n3. Upon receiving the teachings in full, take the Great Dao as the ancestral root. In all actions, maintain right mindfulness and never entertain wayward thoughts.\n\n4. Each morning, recite the true scriptures and secret incantations. Rise early to offer incense, meditating in silence without vocalizing. Let the heart alone resonate, and never allow worldly affairs to disrupt this regular practice.\n\n5. When encountering malevolent spirits or wicked demons harming the people, act strictly in accordance with orthodox teachings, ensuring their execution without fail. If one harbors fear or seeks favor from ghosts and spirits, this betrays a divided heart and incurs grave offense. The Three Officials shall punish without pardon or reprieve.\n\n6. Employ celestial generals and officials with rightful intent. Never use blood offerings to mingle impure *qi*. Violators shall be penalized by the Three Officials.\n\n7. Take the Three Luminaries as the foundation. The Three Luminaries are the eyes of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang, and the ancestral origin of creation. Cultivate the heart and circulate true *qi*, merging with the Imperial Perfected Threefold Radiance as one. Not only will this subdue the Three Realms and bind demonic spirits, but one’s own body shall radiate light, all spirits shall stand in awe, corpses shall be repelled, illness expelled, and one shall attain the Dao and long life, ascending to join the Immortal Perfected.\n\n8. By day, preserve the Three Luminaries and ingest *qi*. By night, preserve the Dipper, presenting it to the body so that self and spirit become one, spirit and *qi* intermingling. Only then may one be called a lineage-holding master.\n\n9. First practice the method of *Three-Eights Atonement*. At each fortnightly solar term, dispatch the body’s celestial generals to offer memorials and engage in cultivation as prescribed. If this is practiced without cease, one shall become a person without fault and may then speak of inheriting the Mystery Teachings.\n\n10. Each day, ingest the talisman of the Three Luminaries and await its response.\n\n11. Abstain from lust and anger. Always respond to the world with kindness and compassion. Sacrifice for others, never attack the root or slander the master, nor envy the worthy or resent the capable. Do not speak with a forked tongue or engage in quarrels and strife. If one has harbored such duality, from this day forward, reform and cultivate virtue. Constantly maintain a single-minded focus: distance oneself from wealth and profit, abandon deceit and flattery, reduce carnal desires, uphold fasting and precepts, and discipline the heart.\n\n12. When offering incense, visualize the five-colored *qi* emanating from the five viscera, coalescing into a floral canopy that ascends to the Empty Mystery. The Celestial Thearch, gazing from the void, shall witness it, and thus the offering shall surely reach its destination.\n\n13. When writing talismans, enter seclusion and stabilize the mind. Dip the brush and compose the talisman, holding the breath and reciting the incantation silently. Clench the fists firmly, adopting an unyielding demeanor. The body must be upright, the heart correct; the heart serene, the spirit responsive.\n\n14. Merge the One Perfected with the Dao. Detach from all external affairs. Do not let the heart be distracted by phenomena or generate covetous thoughts. Reflect on the impermanence of worldly matters; only the Dao endures. Abide in the One Perfected, and the Void shall respond to the One Spirit.\n\n15. Upon entering or exiting, visualize the Heavenly Soldiers, Merit-Officials, and Jade Maidens arrayed to the left and right. Evil shall not dare encroach upon the upright, and even if *qi* stirs with private impulse, preserve the visualization as before.\n\n16. On the ten auspicious days, *gengshen* and *jiazi*, the Three Origins and Three Assemblies, the new and full moons, the eight solar terms, and the five seasonal festivals, retire to a separate chamber to contemplate the Perfected. Always maintain reverence as if hosting honored guests—this is most sublime.\n\n17. Do not inwardly harbor cunning or treacherous thoughts while outwardly displaying a gentle and kind demeanor. Do not covet what is not rightfully yours. Seek only what is justly obtained. Violators must reflect on their faults, reform, and atone. Repeated offenses are forbidden.\n\n18. Serve parents with filial piety. Do not let wealth or poverty alter one’s devotion. Obey and attend to them with joy. To oppose the wishes of one’s kin is called unfiliality. Unfiliality is a grave offense, admitting no pardon.\n\n19. When parents pass away, exert all effort in sincere contemplation and prayer to the Celestial Thearch, seeking their deliverance from the dark realms and ascent to the Heavenly Halls. If parents remain in the gloom of the netherworld, one’s own immortal attainments shall not be fulfilled.\n\n20. Treat brothers, clan members, distant relatives, and in-laws with harmony and kindness. Do not take sides to provoke disputes or harbor resentment, thereby losing the bond of kinship. Violators shall not command the obedience of spirits across the Three Realms. Exercise caution in such matters.\n\nConduct oneself within the bounds of rules and standards. Should the heart ever stray, correct it promptly. Aspire to stand shoulder to shoulder with the sages and worthies. Do not belittle oneself or entertain reckless thoughts.",

Those conducted by scholar-officials and commoners may only be termed \"offering rites.\"\n\n**River Chart, Mysterious Numinosity, and other offerings:** Encompassing dozens of names, all are offerings. In antiquity, \"offering\" was another name for sacrifice. No rite surpasses the offering in summoning the Celestial Thearch and assembling the myriad spirits.\n\n1. State-sponsored offerings follow three-day or seven-day rituals. According to the *Lingbao Scripture*’s fast methods, there are twenty-seven days of observance. Du Guangting’s *Offering Grades* lists seventy-two ranks, all employed by the state. As with the *Three Caverns*’ ritual forms, each has its fixed model.\n\n2. When officials, commoners, scholar-officials, or common households conduct offering fasts, they should limit them to one day and night. Some extend them to three or seven days and nights, but this risks irreverence and may instead incur divine censure. Even high officials do not stay overnight in the homes of commoners; how much less would the Supreme Thearch, dwelling in the ninefold heavens, condescend to remain among mortals for three or seven days and nights without returning? Thus, the offering regulations are set: for a one-day offering, preparations begin in advance, and on the appointed day, the rite commences at dawn and concludes by deep night, thereby avoiding disrespect to the sacred. The ritual forms and grades are recorded in the *Jade Palace* and *Mysterious Model* manuals; one may consult them as needed.\n\n3. For grand offerings held to open the altar, the finest locations are grotto-heavens, blessed lands, and Daoist abbeys. The altar must be properly oriented, facing south with its back to the north. If an abbey already has an altar but its orientation is skewed, one may set up the altar in another suitable space according to the prescribed form.\n\n4. When conducting an offering, one must act within one’s means: the wealthy prepare fully, while the poor adapt as they can. Do not use ill-gotten wealth for offering supplies, nor haggle over prices, nor hastily prepare when resources suffice, nor force arrangements beyond one’s capacity—all such acts lack sincerity and fail to move the spirits. If the sponsor is a household of loyalty and filial piety, exerting utmost effort, and the master performs rites on their behalf—such as presenting dragon silks—all matters should be simplified. The requisite documents, offerings, and other elements will naturally resonate with the divine.\n\n5. The visualization techniques and methods employed during offering rites are recorded in the *Chapter on Circulating the Transformations of Qi*. The musical instruments and celestial processions are detailed in the *Chapter on Heavenly Music and Ritual Regalia*; thus, they are not elaborated here.\n\n6. All documents and dispatches follow the *Jade Palace* and *Mysterious Model* formats, supplemented by ancient precedents. Consult the catalogues and apply them as needed. For instance, memorials to the August Thearch use the *memorial* form, while others use the *petition* form. Documents for spirit officials employ the *official dispatch* form.\n\n7. Memorials always refer to the sender as \"your servant,\" while petitions use the sender’s name. Documents from the Heavenly Pivot Institute refer to the office as \"this bureau.\" For cover slips, official notes, and dispatches, the office is termed \"this bureau.\"\n\n8. On memorials and petitions, leave one hand’s width of space at the top and two at the bottom. The paper should be one foot and four inches in height; for other documents, unfolded letter paper is best. Invitation and offering petitions use only petition paper, as prescribed.\n\n9. For the sacred positions listed within memorials, use yellow labels, filling them in at the time.\n\n10. The yellow cover slip on memorials should be three inches and two *fen* in height and two inches and four *fen* in width, or three inches and six *fen* in height and three inches in width as a standard. Write the cover slip in a single column, and after affixing it, sign your name at the seam and apply the seal.\n\n11. For memorials accompanied by a yellow cover slip, use a small yellow label, affixed diagonally below the Tai Sui. This follows ancient practice, though it is seldom used today.\n\n12. For memorials and petitions that list only one sacred position, use a yellow label affixed diagonally. For two, three, or four positions, use a slightly wider yellow label affixed in the center. For three or five positions, the center is the most honorable; for two or four, the right is the most honorable. Write \"Before the August One\" or \"Before the Sacred\" in the sacred section, or only the foremost position. For petitions to deities of the lower realms, use white labels, applying them as circumstances require.\n\n13. The outer envelopes of memorials and petitions do not require yellow cover slips or the title \"your servant\"; simply write the sender’s name. The same applies to the outer envelopes of memorials, petitions, and other documents. If a petition lists many sacred positions, the envelope need only name the foremost.\n\n14. In memorials and petitions to the Thearch, refer to the decree as the \"Compassionate Edict of the Dao.\" For the August Thearch, use \"Sagely and Wise Edict\"; for the Two Empresses, \"Sacred Edict of the Celestial Palace\"; for the Three Clarities and Four Emperors, \"Your Majesty\"; for the Two Empresses, \"Your Palace\"; for the various August Ones, \"Before the August One\"; for the Perfected, \"Before the Sacred\"; and for deities of the lower realms, \"Before the Spirit,\" \"Before the Court,\" and the like.\n\nThe **Great Yellow Register Fast** possesses ranks and grades; one must consult established precedents and not act recklessly. Those conducted by scholar-officials and commoners may only be termed \"offering rites.\" **River Chart, Mysterious Numinosity, and other offerings** encompass dozens of names, all offerings.

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe present regulations for offering rituals are as follows: For a one-day ritual, preparations are made in advance, and on the appointed day, the ceremony begins at dawn and concludes at deep night, so as not to risk disrespect toward the sacred. The ritual protocols and standards are recorded in such works as the *Jade Capital* and *Mystic Model Administrative Documents*; when the occasion arises, one may consult them.\n\n1. For the opening of the altar and the establishment of a grand offering, it is best to conduct it within the sacred precincts of a grotto-heaven, blessed land, or Daoist abbey. The altar must be positioned with proper orientation, facing south with its back to the north. If the abbey already has an altar but its orientation is slightly off, one may also set up the altar in a separate, secluded hall according to the prescribed form.\n\n2. When establishing an offering, one must act within one’s means: the wealthy may prepare all necessary items, while the poor may adapt as circumstances allow. The materials for the offering must not be acquired through ill-gotten wealth, nor through haggling over prices, nor through careless preparation when one has the means, nor through forced effort when one lacks them. All such actions lack sincerity and make it difficult to move the divine. If the sponsor of the fast is a household of loyalty and filial piety, and their sincerity is wholehearted, the master may provide such items as dragon silks on their behalf, simplifying all matters. The documents, offerings, and other necessities for the ritual will naturally resonate with the divine.\n\n3. The methods of visualization and the esoteric techniques employed during the offering ritual are recorded in the *Chapter on Qi Transformation and Creation*, while the musical instruments and celestial processional regalia are described in the *Chapter on Celestial Music and Processional Regalia*; these will not be detailed here.\n\n4. All documents and administrative procedures should follow the *Jade Capital* and *Mystic Model* systems, as well as the ancient forms recorded in the administrative manuals. Consult the relevant sections when needed. For instance, memorials presented before the August Thearch use the *memorial* format, while others use the *petition* format; communications with divine bureaus use the *official dispatch* format, and so on.\n\n5. Memorials should be signed with “your subject,” while petitions should bear the sender’s name. Documents from the Celestial Pivot Institute should be titled with the bureau’s name, and preceding documents such as *guan*, *tie*, and *die* should refer to “this bureau.”\n\n6. On memorials and petitions, leave a space of one hand’s width at the top and two hand’s widths at the bottom. The paper should be one foot and four inches in height; for other documents, extended stationery is preferable. Invitation and offering documents for the ritual should use standard petition paper, as prescribed.\n\n7. For the sacred titles within memorials, use yellow labels, to be filled in at the time of writing.\n\n8. The yellow strip affixed to the front of a memorial should be three inches and two *fen* in height and two inches and four *fen* in width, or alternatively three inches and six *fen* in height and three inches in width. Write the text in a single column. After affixing the yellow strip, write the sender’s name at the seam and apply the seal.\n\n9. When a memorial is accompanied by a *yi-huang* (supporting yellow document), use a small yellow label and affix it diagonally below the *Tai Sui* (Year Star) position. This follows ancient practice, though it is rarely used today.\n\n10. For memorials and petitions that list multiple sacred titles, use a yellow label affixed diagonally if there is only one title. For two, three, or four titles, use a slightly wider yellow label affixed in the center. For three or five titles, the central position is the most honorable; for two or four titles, the right is the most honorable. In the sacred section, write “Before the August Presence” or “Before the Sacred Presence,” or simply write the foremost title. For petitions to deities of the lower realms, use white labels, to be applied as appropriate.\n\n11. On the outer envelope of a memorial or petition, do not affix a yellow strip or use the term “your subject”; simply write the sender’s name. The same applies to the outer envelopes of memorials, petitions, and other documents. If a petition lists many sacred titles, only the foremost title should be written on the outer envelope.\n\n12. In memorials and petitions to the Supreme Thearch, refer to “the compassionate decree of the Dao”; to the August Thearch, “the sagely and wise decree”; to the Two Empresses, “the august and compassionate sacred decree”; to the Three Clarities and Four Emperors, “Your Majesty”; to the Two Empresses, “Your Palace”; to the various August Thearchs, “Before the August Presence”; to the Perfected, “Before the Sacred Presence”; and to deities of the lower realms, “Before the Divine Presence,” “Before the Court,” and the like. Those who have received official ranks or titles, such as *ma*, are not permitted to participate in fasting rituals.\n\n13. Even the positions below *Du Jiang* (Chief Cantor) must have received the registers of the Orthodox Unity, Numinous Treasure, and Yang Light traditions before they may participate in the altar rites.\n\n14. When inviting Daoist participants to join the fast, they must be those who are accustomed to prostration and kneeling, content with simplicity, devoted to incense and ritual fires, and free from greed for wealth and property. Only then may they take the oath and ascend the altar. They must match the sincerity of the ritual sponsor, earnestly beseeching the vast heavens to manifest their responsiveness. If they merely pursue the beauty of sound and rhythm without focused devotion, they will not only waste their energy and squander resources but may also incur blame and achieve nothing. The method of conducting rituals depends entirely on the selection of participants; this must not be taken lightly.\n\n15. Daoist youths serving as ritual attendants must first practice the *Bu Xu* hymns, the raising of voices, and the singing of *Hua Xia* and *Yin Ling* until they are proficient. When ascending the altar and circumambulating, they should follow the lead and harmonize with the chanting.\n\n16. When establishing an offering, one must exert utmost sincerity and reverence. Items such as dragon silks, jades, and swords must be of the finest quality. Incense, flowers, oil, and candles—all required supplies—must be pure and immaculate, free from any defilement. If anything is lacking at the time of use, it may instead incur divine censure. In all offerings, single-minded devotion is paramount; dragon silks are of the highest importance, followed by the reverent purity of incense and candles. Any deficiency is a flaw in the ritual. Those who serve in such rites must be especially vigilant.\n\n17. If a coffin remains in the house, one should not open an altar or establish an offering. If the residence is spacious and the funeral is held elsewhere, outside the altar’s precincts, the ritual may proceed. If there are any inauspicious or defiling influences from birth or death that have not been resolved, one must not establish an altar in the household. This must be strictly avoided.\n\n18. When burning incense, do not use fire from the kitchen hearth. When burning paper money and other offerings, do not use oil lamp or candle flames to ignite them.\n\n**Heavenly Heart Mysterious Secret Chapter**\nIn ancient times, the Primordial Heavenly King suspended a millet pearl over the black soil and commanded the August Person to expound the *Dong Zhang* (Cavern Chapters).",

      "translated_text": "The Most High Lord Lao ascended the Jade Bureau in Chengdu, where he transmitted scriptures and esoteric instructions to Zhang Daoling. The Daoist methods encompass forty-two altars, and the jiao rituals seventy-two grades, disseminated throughout the mortal world to propagate teachings and transformation. Later generations of lineage-bearing Daoists accumulated merit and amassed virtuous conduct, aligning with the Dao to attain perfection. When the heart stirs, the spirit follows; the efficacy of the methods flourishes, and the teachings expand. Thus, the Daoist methods and talismanic writs branched and proliferated, spreading widely through the ages. The arts of the Dao comprise over three thousand ranks, which cannot be exhaustively recorded. Here, only one or two are briefly outlined to convey their general scope.\n\n**Fourteen Altars of Heavenly Jiao**\nThe *Yellow Emperor’s Jiao Announcement Chapter* states: When mortals perform rites of exorcism, prayer, sacrifice, or ancestral deliverance, or when seeking to avert calamity or cure illness, only those who serve the Dao as Heaven’s adherents may conduct the rites of Heavenly Jiao to petition the celestial realms. For those outside the Daoist tradition who perform exorcisms, prayers, or ancestral deliverance, they are permitted only to summon the city gods, earth deities, local spirits, and officials of the underworld. They must not presumptuously invoke the Celestial Emperor or divine thearchs. Thus, the Thunder Bureau enforces the office of execution and investigation. Should any who are not Daoist adherents of Heaven dare to encroach upon the Celestial Emperor, they shall face the severing of their spirit, the annihilation of their soul, the forfeiture of their allotted lifespan, and the extinction of their years. How could one not stand in awe?\n\n**Major Jiao Rituals**\n- **Golden Register Universal Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 3,600 divine stations\n- **Jade Register Circumambient Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 2,400 divine stations\n- **Yellow Register Multitudinous Heavenly Grand Jiao**: 1,200 divine stations\n- **Grand Unity Jiao**\n- **Nine Heavens Jiao**\n- **River Chart Thirty-Six Heavens Jiao**\n- **Jade Casket Alliance of Perfected Jiao**\n- **Numinous Treasure Spontaneous Jiao**\n- **Cavern Abyss Samādhi Jiao**\n- **Disaster-Dispelling Jiao**\n- **Fortune and Steed Transfer Jiao**\n- **Nine Yous Jiao**\n- **Deliverance Jiao**\n- **Filial Piety and Ancestral Offering Jiao**\n\nAccording to the Daoist canon’s established system, the Golden Register, Jade Register, and Yellow Register Jiao each have fixed formats for their sacred stations and ritual configurations. Common jiao rituals comprise forty-eight altars, with memorial offerings and monetary petitions arranged in twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-two, sixty, seventy-two, one hundred twenty, two hundred forty, or three hundred sixty stations. The rites of the jiao mirror the solemnity of worldly protocol. The Dao is magnified through human effort; one must not cling rigidly to convention.\n\n**Thirty-Nine Ranks of Daoist Methods**\n- *Numinous Treasure Scripture of Salvation: Supreme Method*\n- *Unsurpassed Jade Hall of the Three Heavens: Supreme Method*\n- *Qingwei Yuanjiang: Supreme Method*\n- *Qingwei Shenlie: Supreme Method*\n- *Shangqing Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method*\n- *Northern Culmen Heavenly Heart Orthodox Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Six Ding Secret Method*\n- *Big Dipper Six Locks Secret Method*\n- *Three Expulsions and Five Liberations Secret Method*\n- *Six Jia Prayer Secret Method*\n- *Penetrating the Dipper: Marquis Wu Secret Method*\n- *Mysterious Unity Five Thunder Secret Method*\n- *Harmonizing Spirits Five Responses Secret Method*\n- *Brahma Qi Thunder Method*\n- *Shangqing Numinous Treasure Supreme Method*\n- *Jade Clarity Perfected King Purple Palace Supreme Method*\n- *Zhengming Loyalty and Filial Piety Daoist Method*\n- *Five Thunder Summoning and Interrogation Supreme Method*\n- *Jade Clarity Comprehensive Method*\n- *Five Thunder Execution and Investigation Method*\n- *Cavern Mystery Prayer Method*\n- *Primordial Unity Qi Supreme Method*\n- *Returning Chariot and Completing the Dao Orthodox Method*\n- *Nine Elders Subduing Demons Method*\n- *Heaven and Earth Teaching: Lantern and Water Method*\n- *Hunyuan Attack Qi Method*\n- *Purple Court Pursuit of Merit Method*\n- *Flying Spirit Audience with the Emperor Method*\n- *Comprehensive Memorial Method*\n- *Six Ding Six Jia Concealment Method*\n- *Palm Thunder Method*\n- *Prayer for Clear Skies, Rain, or Snow Method*\n- *Vow-Covering Method*\n- *Five Thunder Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Method*\n- *Heavenly Peng Method*\n- *Heavenly Pivot Method*\n- *Marquis Zhao Southern Method*\n- *Knot-Grinding Prayer Method*\n\nUpon examination, Daoist methods each have their own transmissions and variations. Here, only those commonly practiced in the world are recorded. Additionally, there are methods involving the Thunder Bureau and Fengdu officials, whose names are too numerous to list exhaustively.\n\n**Seven Ranks of Refinement and Salvation Methods**\n- *Qingwei Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Grand Ultimate Inner Refinement and Sacrificial Method*\n- *Jade Yang Sacrificial Refinement Method*\n- *Zhengming Yiyang Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Numinous Treasure Refinement and Salvation Method*\n- *Jade Palace Scripture Refinement Method*\n- *Three Luminaries Refinement and Salvation Method*\n\n**Fourteen Ranks of Dipper Memorial Methods**\n- *Qingwei Mysterious Pivot Memorial*\n- *Grand Unity Fire Mansion Memorial*\n- *Dipper Irrigation Five Thunder Memorial*\n- *Mysterious Numinous Deliverance Memorial*\n- *Qingwei Purple Light Memorial*\n- *Divine Empyrean Hastening to the Palace Memorial*\n- *Qingwei Prayer Memorial*\n- *Divine Empyrean Fire Bell Memorial*\n- *Jinming Memorial*\n- *Xuanji Nine Lights Memorial*\n- *Yuntian Memorial*\n- *Sun the Perfected’s Turtle Memorial*\n- *Opening the Lotus and Manifesting the Dipper Memorial*\n- *Cloud-Enveloping Manifestation of the Dipper Memorial*",

      "translated_text": "The Master Laozi said, \"One who knows the ancient beginning is said to grasp the Dao’s discipline.\" Thus, just as the Buddhist clergy established monastic regulations, the Daoist tradition developed its own designations.\n\n**Daoist Titles**\nThe Yellow Emperor addressed the Herdboy as \"Celestial Master\"—this was the first instance. Later, during the Han, Zhang Daoling was also called Celestial Master. Daoist names and titles all derive from the principles of Laozi’s *Daodejing*. Characters such as *Dao*, *Mysterious (xuan)*, and *Subtle (miao)*—these are not teachings of China’s native tradition, yet foreign peoples have appropriated them.\n\n**Purple Robes**\nDuring the Tang, Li Bi was born with divine spirit. As a child, his body was so light he could levitate, and his mother often heard celestial music in the air. Fearing he would ascend and depart, she sprinkled his head with juice of scallions and garlic. Later, under Emperor Daizong, he was appointed as chief minister.

Ritual Officers or Daoists who receive the *Three Caverns* and *Great Cavern Registers and Scriptures* may command and dispatch all ranks of celestial officials and spirits throughout the world, whether they possess the scriptures without the registers or the registers without the scriptures, the same applies.\n\n3. Ritual Officers or Daoists who ascend to the celestial bureaus to present memorials and petitions or pay homage to the Highest Perfected Ones through secret talismans and incantations must first obtain approval from the relevant offices before proceeding. Those of official rank below the seventh grade are exempt. Those who violate this shall be expelled. Those who proceed without authorization shall be disbarred.\n\n4. If Ritual Officers or Daoists who present memorials and petitions through the secret talismans and incantations of the Most High receive responses but disclose them to others, their lifespan shall be reduced by twelve years.\n\n5. When Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials and petitions, only those submitted through the Celestial Pivot Institute, the Yellow Memorials of the Mysterious Capital, or the headers of memorials and petitions for ritual offerings may not contain a single erroneous character. Violations shall render the ritual void, and the memorials shall fail to reach the officiating Ritual Officer. Both the Ritual Officer and the petitioner shall be sentenced to five years of penal servitude.\n\n6. If Ritual Officers or Daoists list incorrect ranks or falsely claim official titles, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years.\n\n7.

Those who knowingly violate this shall have their penalty increased by one degree.\n\n12. When Ritual Officers or Daoists present memorials and petitions for others, they must do so according to proper form. For other ritual offerings, they may perform services according to their capacity. If the petitioner is poor or of low status and unable to afford more, even a single lamp or flower suffices. However, those who lack sincerity shall be sentenced to five years of penal servitude.\n\n13. If Ritual Officers or Daoists conduct rituals and ascend the altar without reverence, engage in frivolous speech, laughter, or clamor, cast sidelong glances, stand with their backs turned, spit, summon servants, or fail to observe the decorum of a subject, their lifespan shall be reduced by six years.

Offering tablets must be nine inches in length, two *fen* in thickness, and two inches and four *fen* in width.

Both the Ritual Officer and the ritual sponsor shall be sentenced to two years of penal servitude.\n\n19. When laypersons conduct rituals, they may not burn sandalwood, benzoin, or frankincense.

Violators shall bring retribution upon three generations of their family, while the Ritual Officers or Daoists involved shall have their lifespan reduced by three years.\n\n20.

Their parents, spouse, and children shall suffer the consequences, and after death, they shall be sent to Fengdu, never to be released for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n21.

Seven generations of their ancestors and nine generations of their forebears shall suffer calamity, and they themselves shall encounter many misfortunes in life. Those who wear the talismanic cord shall have their penalty increased by two degrees; those who commit severe offenses shall have their lifespan reduced according to the gravity of their crimes.\n\n22.

All these prohibitions are the ancient statutes of the Mysterious Capital’s Upper Palace, meant to admonish negligence, correct transgressions, examine conduct, and observe sincerity. If there are faults, they shall be rectified according to the matter at hand. This is not to punish those who partake in fasts but to open the door for correcting faults. If one knows their errors and reforms, their offenses shall also be absolved.

      "translated_text": "Emperor Cheng of Jin inquired during the Xianhe era: In Leimai and other commanderies, eighty scholars of Buddhism petitioned to enter temples as monks, while in Mount Song and other places, two hundred Daoists petitioned to have their names expunged and enter the Dao. The Emperor said to Wang Dao: \"I have often said that the human body is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Land is difficult to attain. Yet now the people of the Central Land turn away from the Dao of the Central Land, wishing to be reborn in the West as Hu barbarians rather than live in the Central Land—how utterly foolish! Is this not what Emperor Zhang of Han meant by 'the Dao transforms the wise, while Buddhism transforms the foolish'?\"\n\nWang Dao replied: \"Truly, these are words of truth, worthy to serve as a warning for ten thousand generations.\" Thus, the saying \"the Dao transforms the wise, while Buddhism transforms the foolish\" arose from this time. Though such words have since become common, Daoists must never utter them, lest they invite calamity—this must be strictly avoided.\n\nAccording to the Perfected One Huangfu: \"The sages established teachings in accordance with local customs and natural dispositions. Those whose endowment is dull, rooted in earth, find joy in death; those whose nature is keen, rooted in heaven, find joy in life. As the *Book of Changes* says: 'That which is rooted in heaven inclines upward; that which is rooted in earth inclines downward.' Those who find joy in death—did not the Buddha in the *Nirvana Sutra* speak of 'sitting in extinction, extinction itself being bliss'? Those who find joy in life—did not Laozi say, 'My fate lies with me, not with Heaven'? The Way of life and death exists for both the wise and the foolish; why then must we insist on distinguishing their joys?\"\n\nThis passage expounds the matter most reasonably, and so it is adopted here.\n\n**Prohibition on Disputation**\nA great taboo is to engage in disputes with others. The teaching of the *Daodejing* states: \"Only by not contending does the world find none able to contend with him.\" The *Qingzheng Jing* says: \"The superior person does not contend; the inferior person delights in contention.\" Should one encounter hostility or slander in speech, one should respond thus: \"I have often said that the human body is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Land is difficult to attain. Having been born in the Central Land, one rarely encounters the true Dao. I am a person of the Central Land, born in the Central Land, and I follow the Dao of the sages of the Central Land. This is to neither betray the Heaven that gave me life nor the earth that bore me. For a person of the Central Land to follow the Dao of the Central Land is only right. To turn one’s back on the land of one’s birth and follow another teaching is to be no better than a beast, forgetting the virtue of Heaven and Earth that gave one life—how can such a one be called a cultivator? As for the superiority or inferiority of teachings, I know not. But this answer alone places principle above personal bias.\"\n\n**Seating Order for Daoists and Buddhists**\nWhenever Buddhists visit an abbey or observatory, Daoists should yield the higher seat to them. When Daoists visit a temple, Buddhists should likewise yield the higher seat to them. This is the courtesy due to visiting guests. If they meet elsewhere, both Daoists and Buddhists should defer to the elder, yielding the higher seat. Though their teachings differ as between Chinese and barbarian, harmony is the highest principle, and humility is the virtue of the cultivated.\n\n**Designations of Monks and Daoists**\nIn the fifth year of Yonghui during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of Tang, a Hu monk and a Daoist disputed over their titles, saying: \"One only hears people call us 'monk-Daoist,' never 'Daoist-monk.' Why should the Hu monk be ranked above the Daoist?\" The Emperor said: \"The Daoist is a person of Our Central Land, while you are a Hu barbarian. How can a man of the barbarian tribes be placed above a person of the Central Land? In the rites of the Central Land, the honored are distinguished from the lowly. Barbarians are not even permitted to wear caps or shoes in the same manner as the Chinese—how much less should they be ranked above them!\"\n\nThe Emperor said to Yu Zhining: \"Consider the common saying 'barbarian and Chinese.' The Chinese are the Central Land, yet they are placed below the barbarians—is this right? Or take the terms 'yin and yang': yin is the petty man, inauspicious; yang is the noble man, auspicious. Should yang be placed below yin? Or take 'fortune and misfortune': why not speak of fortune first and misfortune after? Is misfortune to be considered auspicious? Or take 'ghosts and spirits': ghosts are lowly spirits, while spirits are celestial. Why should lowly ghosts be placed above celestial spirits? Or take 'crooked and straight, slanted and upright': upright and straight are good, while slanted and crooked are not. Should the inauspicious names come first? In all common sayings, the inauspicious and unpropitious are placed first. The ranking of monks and Daoists, high and low, follows the same principle. From this, one may discern the order of auspicious and inauspicious, noble and base, Chinese and barbarian. By this example, how can the dignity of the Dao be sullied?\"\n\n**Prohibition on Discussing Karma and Retribution**\nEmperor Wuzong of Tang said: \"In the Tianjian era of Emperor Wu of Liang, the name 'Righteous Students' was established. Each was required to fabricate ten tales of hellish karma and retribution to delude the world, bewitching the foolish to seek alms. Over eight hundred such tales were compiled and scattered throughout barbarian books like the *Dharma Garden* and *Forest of Gems*. The original transmission of the Buddhist teachings had the patriarchs going barefoot, carrying alms bowls, and begging for food as their practice—how could deluding the world to seek wealth be considered cultivation? Yet the foolish men and women of the world are all deceived, some even squandering their fortunes to make offerings. The Dao of the Daoist household is the Dao of the sages of the Central Land. One must never speak of ghosts, demons, strange omens, hellish karma, or retribution, nor beg in the streets to shame the ancestral teachings. Such conduct is that of shameless vagrants, not of the people of the Central Land. It must be strictly prohibited.\"\n\n**Prohibition on False Relics**\nThere was a Daoist named Tao Yuansu who met another Daoist claiming to be Huangfu Xin. He led Tao to a pine tree, where they saw a white-bearded man who felt Tao’s head and said: \"This child has extraordinary bones in his skull. One day, he may study the Dao.\"",

      "translated_text": "The parents then offered him to the Temple of Supreme Heaven, where he became a disciple of the Daoist Teng Bixiao. At nineteen, he encountered an elder who bestowed upon him the *Book of Celestial Marrow and Numinous Scripture*. Later, he wandered to Mount Kongtong and subsequently resided on Mount Taihua. By the thirteenth year of the Tianjian reign of the Liang Dynasty (the year jiawu), he was one hundred and eighty-two years old. The Emperor, having heard of his transcendent and ethereal Dao, dispatched envoys with an imperial edict to summon him, but he declined. He then composed a poem:\n\n*\"Through Jin, Qi, and Liang—nearly two centuries passed,\nYet worldly affairs still kept me apart.\nToday, I shed this mortal coil,\nAnd ascend to the Great Veil beside the Heavenly Emperor.\"*\n\nThereupon, he instructed his disciples: \"I shall now depart. Cremate my body and do not preserve my remains.\" He then removed his robe, sat cross-legged, and passed away. This occurred on the first day of the first month in the fourteenth year of the Tianjian reign (the year yiwei). His disciples cremated him, and among his bones were found pearls of red and white, some as large as soybeans, radiant and lustrous, as hard as stone—three hundred and ninety-nine in total. The envoys presented them to the court.\n\nFan Yun remarked: \"The Western Hu possess secret arts of the bedchamber, wherein they absorb yin through the union of qi, producing objects of red and purple hues, heavy in weight. The Hu call these *śarīra*. The Western Hu also have a hard stone indistinguishable from these, often using *dragon’s blood resin* to dye bones, which deceivers in China, skilled in self-cultivation, claim to be formed from the pure yang essence of virgin youths—red and white in color, calling them *yang essence* or *śarīra*. Yet these are nothing but the foul remnants of the dead. How could they be presented to the court? If one has attained the Dao, they must ascend to heaven, leaving no withered bones behind. If death occurs, and the corpse is burned, the foul remnants remain—how can this be called attainment? Among common households, even a single dead man’s bones left in a dwelling are called *hidden corpses*, inauspicious objects that must be exorcised by shamans. How much worse to bring them into the court! The envoys should be executed.\"\n\nThe Emperor thus refused the offering. Thereupon, the Celestial Master issued a decree to all temples and abbeys across the land: \"Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, the sages of the Central Land have never regarded death as attainment of the Dao. If one claims to have attained the Dao, why would they still die? They would merely be called lesser ghosts. Moreover, to leave behind the remains of a corpse, forming so-called *yang essence*, and deceive the foolish masses—henceforth, anyone who dares to delude others with *yang essence* or *śarīra* shall be condemned as a heretic.\"\n\n**Admonitions on Ritual Burning and Cultivation**\nAccording to the principles of ritual burning and cultivation: The duty of the Daoist is to burn incense and light lamps morning and evening, offer water and flowers, recite scriptures, and perform repentance rites to seek blessings and merit. The halls must be kept immaculate, with sacred images and ritual implements spotless and orderly, not a speck of dust allowed to settle. They must be constantly dusted and swept, ensuring no filth or grime accumulates on the floors or within the halls and chambers. This is called laboring with devotion before the Heavenly Emperor, entrusting oneself to a realm of purity and nobility—the true duty of a Daoist. Those who uphold this will surely receive blessings and rewards. To neglect even one of these duties is to invite calamity from heaven.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, one must devote all effort to tending vegetable gardens and exhaust all care in cooking and hearth-tending, gathering firewood and drawing water, enduring hardship in body and mind, toiling with limbs and flesh—this is called accumulating the merit of diligent labor, by which one repays the grace of Heaven and Earth for the gift of life. If one’s merit is great, the blessings and rewards shall be profound. Should one fail in both these duties, one bears the name of Daoist in vain, secretly enjoying the blessings of heaven and humanity. After the body perishes, one shall receive the retribution of an animal’s fate, escaping neither the suffering of the butcher’s block nor the torment of punishment—how can one not fear this!\n\nHere is appended the *Admonitions Verified* by Cao Jinwei of Tanzhou. Its summary states:\n\nFormerly, Kou Qianzhi said: All who are born into the world under the baleful influence of inauspicious stars, destined for poverty and early death, owe this to the deep-rooted karmic offenses accumulated over past lives. They ought to renounce the household life, serve the Heavenly Emperor, and seek the power of blessings—only then may they escape poverty and early death. Thus did the practice of ritual burning and renunciation flourish.\n\nIn former times, there was one Xu Mi of Jingzhao, who from childhood suffered many illnesses. A diviner declared: “This child will not only be plagued by illness but is also fated for poverty and early death.” His parents did not yet believe it. When he reached eleven, a physiognomist said: “This child’s lifespan will not exceed fifteen years.” His parents, startled, asked: “Is there a way to avert this?” The physiognomist replied: “If you wish to escape calamity, there is no recourse but to leave the household life—only then may he barely survive.”\n\nThereupon, he was given to the Xuanyuan Abbey east of the city to become a Daoist. Mi diligently tended the incense and lamps morning and evening, sweeping the halls and corridors. Broom in hand, he did not shrink from labor in the winding cloisters; sickle and hoe in tow, he constantly exerted himself in the garden plots. At night, he recited scriptures and performed repentance rites, sat in meditation with focused intent, burned incense, and bowed in earnest devotion. Daily, he repaired walls and mended roofs, never idle for a moment. His hands and feet grew calloused and cracked like tortoise shells. Moreover, he did not consume the abbey’s provisions but prepared his own daily meals; he did not burn the abbey’s firewood but gathered his own and drew his own water for sustenance.\n\nSomeone, pitying his toil, asked: “Why do you endure so much hardship?” He replied: “For one who cultivates the Dao, the matter of life and death is grave—how can I rely on others to serve me while I do nothing myself? If others become my servants, I shall instead receive the blessings of heaven and humanity.”\n\nThus he persevered for over forty years. One day, he encountered a Daoist beneath the shade of a pine, who took his hand and said: “You have labored long. The Heavenly Emperor grants you longevity and bestows upon you rank. Soon, your name shall resound throughout the capital.” The court later appointed him Director of Daoist Affairs at Jingxiao Abbey, conferring upon him the title *Perfected One Who Assists the Dao and Transforms the World*. In the first year of Emperor Fei of the Southern Qi, during the reign of Yulin Wang, he reached the age of one hundred and one. The ruler of Northern Wei, hearing of this, dispatched envoys bearing gold and silk.\n\nAs his Dao neared completion, he met three Daoists who invited him to wander with them. He went, and during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Liang, there was one who abandoned Buddhism to study the Dao. Entering Mount Mao, he encountered Mi, who rode a great ram and said: “Go and tell the Daoist community of Xuanyuan Abbey in Jingzhao: I now serve as Left Minister of the Heavenly Canopy’s Inner Terrace in the Celestial Bureau.” From then on, his story spread throughout the world, and all who renounced the household life to serve the Dao came to know the value of diligence and reverence.

This is called laboring with devotion before the Heavenly Emperor, entrusting oneself to a realm of purity and nobility—the true duty of a Daoist. Those who uphold this will surely receive blessings and rewards. To neglect even one of these duties is to invite calamity from heaven.",

      "translated_text": "When those who leave the household life first do so, it is often because their fate is afflicted by inauspicious stars, and their parents, fearing they cannot be raised, relinquish their six kin to entrust them to abbeys and temples. Later generations, unaware of cause and effect, have seen those who leave the household become mostly indolent, arrogant, and dissolute. They eat others’ food to sate their hunger, accept others’ reverence, seek others’ alms, yet feel no momentary shame. They pay no heed to whether incense burns in the halls, whether the steps and courtyards are clean, or whether the temple walls and roofs are crumbling. Idly they enjoy ease and pleasure, refusing to labor in devotion or reverence. Compared to the example of Xu Mi, how can this not weigh upon their hearts?\n\nMoreover, the laws of Heaven are stern, and the eyes of spirits see all. Though one may briefly enjoy warmth and fullness, one may yet fall into a lower existence! How could one advance toward the trials of Fengdu? From the age of eight, I left the household life, and now my hair has turned white. Often, as I face my meal, I reflect in silence, having done nothing to aid the teachings. I fear my transgressions run deep, and calamity may befall my nine generations. Thus, I universally admonish those who have left the household: all should awaken sharply, lest they sink into torpor. Perhaps then we may together ascend the ladder of immortality and uphold the Mysterious Principle.\n\nIn the second year of the Jianlong era of the Great Song, on the day following the full moon of the third month, Bai Jinwei, a Daoist of Shouxing Abbey in Tanzhou, Successor of the Orthodox Teaching of the Three Caverns, Subduer of Demons in the Qingwei Tradition, respectfully writes this.\n\n**Morning and Evening Observances**\nAll who dwell in jade halls and numinous abodes must prioritize the burning of incense and the performance of rites. The abbot of each abbey or temple shall daily gather the community to ascend the hall, burn incense, chant scriptures, pay homage to the Perfected, and offer veneration to the Sages. They should embody the heart of serving Heaven and upholding the teachings, thereby fulfilling their resolve to cultivate the Dao and refine their virtue.\n\n**New and Full Moons**\nOn the days of the new and full moons, bathe the day prior. At dawn on the appointed day, the abbot shall lead the community, clad in Daoist robes, to ascend the hall in proper order and chant scriptures—first to extend the Sage’s longevity, and second to propagate the Mysterious Model.\n\n**Festivals and Seasonal Observances**\nOn festival and seasonal days, perform the rites of homage to the Perfected. After the morning observances, revive the customs of antiquity by gathering in ritual feasts, strictly adhering to ancestral norms, and avoiding neglect or dissipation.\n\n**Opening and Closing the Abbey Gates**\nThe gates of abbeys and temples are of utmost importance and must be opened and closed at set times. At dawn, wait for light to open them; at dusk, close them while there is still light. The locks shall be managed by the designated officer, while the keys shall be kept by the common treasury. Opening and closing must follow the appointed times.\n\n**Morning Bells and Evening Drums**\nThe morning bell and evening drum summon the hundred spirits, enhance the majesty of abbeys and temples, and amplify the grandeur of mountains and mausoleums. They must not be omitted at dawn or dusk.\n\n**Morning Tea Assembly**\nAfter ascending the hall each day, Daoists and novices shall gather in the abbot’s quarters, arrange themselves in ranks, and bow before the abbot. Then, dividing into two ranks, the community shall bow to one another. Daoists shall sit in order, while novices shall bow toward the abbot, serve tea in turn, and stand respectfully below. The abbot shall address the day’s affairs. If there are public or private matters, official duties, or urgent business, they shall be reported to the abbot and discussed openly before the community. Once concluded, all shall bow and withdraw, upholding the pure regulations and not neglecting the Mysterious Teachings.\n\n**The Common Treasury**\nThe common treasury is the guiding principle of abbeys and temples. Those appointed to manage it must be persons of great virtue, magnanimity, impartiality, and integrity. All matters—such as the receipt and disbursement of money, grain, and cloth; the cultivation of fields, gardens, and mountain lands; and the reception of visiting officials—shall be assigned to various officers, who shall take turns overseeing them for one, two, or three years. They must act with fairness, devote themselves to the public good, and never favor private interests.\n\nThe Perfected Lord Yuchan said: “The common treasury’s wealth and grain are overseen by spirits; those who take from it shall each receive their karmic retribution.” These words are not empty—one must be vigilant and cautious.\n\n**Refectory and Banquets**",

      "translated_text": "**Attending Refectory Banquets**\n\nWhen attending banquets in the refectory, one must take one’s seat in proper order, strictly observing the rites of seniority and precedence—no disorder shall be permitted.\n\n**Daily Meals in the Refectory**\nEach person shall be allotted one *sheng* of rice per day from the common treasury. Vegetables, fish, and meat shall be provided according to abundance or scarcity. The three daily meals shall be announced by striking the cloud-shaped board, summoning the assembly to partake at the appointed times.\n\nWhen itinerant Daoist travelers arrive, they shall be provided meals for seven days in accordance with ancient custom. Those who remain through winter or summer to sit in meditation shall be furnished meals for one hundred days. Daoists serving in an official capacity at the abbey or temple shall receive rice on the same terms as resident Daoists and are not subject to these limitations.\n\nWhen eminent and virtuous masters from the capital or renowned sacred mountains visit the abbey or temple, they shall be received with doubled courtesy, their needs supplied without regard to duration.\n\n**Refectory Stores**\nDaily provisions shall follow established regulations. No private favors shall be granted, nor shall supplies be arbitrarily disbursed for personal use. Should vulgar and shameless individuals demand wine or food, those managing the common treasury must uphold the regulations with strict discipline. Violators shall be penalized by sponsoring a vegetarian feast at their own expense, to which the entire abbey must be invited.\n\n**Taking Disciples**\nIn accepting disciples, one must select the descendants of reputable families with long-standing virtue and renown in their communities—those who have cultivated the Dao and accumulated merit. They must be free of debilitating illnesses or impediments. Only those received with proper rites and bound as Daoist kin may be admitted.\n\nThe descendants of indolent or worldly artisans, as well as those afflicted with foul odors, blindness, facial scars, polydactyly, lameness, or other disabilities, shall not be taken as disciples.\n\n**Issuing Ordination Certificates**\nWhen Daoist novices enter the Mystic Gate in childhood and study the scriptures of their tradition, those who mature into individuals of true Daoist capacity may, upon reaching the appropriate year for ordination, submit a petition to the Daoist Registry in advance to ensure a smooth process. Thus, the transmission shall endure from generation to generation without interruption.\n\n**Ritual Offerings**\nWhen patrons bring incense to the abbey or temple to sponsor ritual offerings, the common treasury shall assign responsible Daoists to oversee all related matters. They must perform their duties with reverence, adhering to the rites of celestial worship, and never betray the patron’s trust.\n\n**Soliciting Alms**\nWhen abbeys or temples undertake renovations, they must rely on the generosity of benefactors. The common treasury shall appoint capable individuals to carry petitions and solicit funds and grain to support the construction.\n\nFirst, they should seek out wealthy and virtuous households in distant regions known for their benevolence. If such families are genuinely inclined to donate, they shall be respectfully approached. Those who, despite their wealth, remain miserly and unwilling to give shall be passed by. Donations of any amount, whether large or small, shall be gratefully received.\n\n**Renovations and Repairs**\nMaintenance must never be neglected. Several individuals shall be appointed to conduct regular inspections. Halls, walls, ditches, and pathways—anything damaged shall be repaired immediately. Bricks, tiles, bamboo, timber, nails, iron, and lime shall all be requisitioned from the common treasury. Funds and grain solicited for this purpose shall be prepared in advance, stored in the upper treasury, and reserved for renovations.\n\n**Sweeping and Cleaning**\nBefore sweeping any hall, water must first be sprinkled to settle the dust. After a brief interval, a broom shall be used to gather dust into piles at intervals of five *chi*, ensuring it is not scattered haphazardly. Otherwise, dust may rise and obscure sacred images, banners, and floral decorations—this must be strictly avoided.\n\n**Grain Management**\nFor abbeys or temples with grain stores, the accounting shall be handled by the grain office. Whether through exchange, transport, or retention, all decisions must be made in advance to avoid missing delivery deadlines. Trustworthy individuals shall be appointed to oversee transport to the granary, ensuring timely completion to avoid urgent demands.\n\n**Managing Distant Farmlands**\nFor farmlands located far from the abbey or temple, granaries and storage sheds shall be established to store grain, agricultural tools, and other necessities. Only honest and reliable locals shall be employed as caretakers. Outsiders without proper ties must not be allowed to reside there, lest theft or pilfering occur over time, leading to unforeseen troubles. Careful consideration must be given beforehand to avoid future regrets.\n\n**Collecting Rent**\nFor abbeys or temples with extensive farmlands, landless peasants shall be recruited as tenants. Agreements must be made in advance, specifying the amount of pure grain rent to be paid. At harvest time, overseers shall be dispatched to the fields to supervise the reaping, threshing, and storage, ensuring the rent is collected in full and on time. Tenants shall be prohibited from privately harvesting the crops, thus preventing any shortfall in rent.\n\n**Lending Grain**\nWhen the common treasury has surplus grain, it may be lent to upright and respectable villagers for their sustenance. At harvest time, the principal along with interest shall be collected as per the agreement. This is not for the treasury’s profit but to assist the local populace in times of need.\n\n**Granaries and Storehouses**\nGranaries and storehouses, where the common treasury’s supplies are stored, must be separate from living quarters and not directly connected to avoid the risk of fire. Those in charge must be strict and vigilant.\n\n**Gardens and Vegetable Plots**\nDaily vegetables must never be lacking; they should be cultivated diligently. All varieties may be eaten, except for the five pungent vegetables—onion, garlic, leek, *xie*, and *wei*—which Daoist practitioners must not consume. As the *Erya* states: “Those who observe fasts and abstain from the five pungent vegetables refer to these five,” not to fish or meat. Daoists observing fasts must take note.\n\n**Requesting Leave**\nWhen visiting family, calling on friends, or traveling afar, one must request leave. The destination must be verified to ensure no impediments exist before permission is granted. No false pretenses shall be tolerated, nor shall others be brought along, lest disputes arise and the reputation of the Daoist community be tarnished. All must exercise caution.\n\n**Cloud Wandering**\nDaoists who travel to seek the truth and inquire into the Dao are called *cloud wanderers*. Daoists are servants of Heaven, and those who align with Heaven naturally ascend—hence the term *cloud wandering*. Such wanderers must be skilled in praying for clear skies or rain, dispelling evil and banishing demons, alleviating disasters and rescuing those in distress. They should also be versed in geomancy, physiognomy, astrology, divination, poetry, calligraphy, and painting before setting forth.",

The unworthy shall not be protected by personal favor, nor shall the virtuous be envied out of private resentment. All must act with impartiality to command the respect of the community.\n\n**Appointment to Office**\nRegardless of whether they come from afar or nearby, those of Daoist attainment and capable of managing affairs shall be invited with propriety into abodes and temples to assume office.\n\n**The Abbot**\nShould the chief of an abode or temple commit transgressions, the community shall admonish them thrice. If they fail to reform, they shall step down to make way for one of virtue to succeed them.\n\n**Disciplinary Measures for Daoists in Violation**\nAll violations shall be addressed by the community. For minor offenses, the wrongdoer shall be admonished face-to-face and urged to reform and cultivate goodness. For offenses beyond the bounds of the law, the *Pure Regulations* shall be applied, and their transgressions recorded in the register. After three recorded offenses, the offender shall be seated at the lowest rank during assemblies and barred from ascending the altar during grand jiao rites. For those whose evil is grave and intolerable, making cohabitation in the abode or temple impossible, the community shall expel them. After their expulsion, a broom shall sweep their traces from the ground, severing all ties to prevent their return.\n\n**Established Disciplinary Methods**\nSince ancient times, abodes and temples have maintained disciplinary methods through established regulations. The system of discipline is as follows: for offenses comparable to those punishable by flogging or caning under common law, the penalty shall be halved. For instance, if a commoner’s offense warrants forty strokes, the Daoist *Pure Regulations* impose only twenty, allowing the offender to correct their ways and reflect. For other offenses, the severity shall be measured against the law, and penalties determined accordingly—this is the method of discipline and admonition in the Daoist tradition. However, if an offense is brought before the authorities, the penalty for a Daoist shall be one degree harsher than that for a commoner. Why? Because those who cultivate the Dao are duty-bound to accumulate merit, humble their bodies, and endure shame. To commit an offense is to reveal a lack of true cultivation. Dwelling in grand halls, eating without labor, and enjoying the blessings of heaven and humanity—how can their punishment not be one degree harsher than that of commoners? How can they not be held in awe?\n\n**Design of the Pure Regulations Discipline Ruler**\nConstructed of wood, it shall be one *cun* and four *fen* in width, four *fen* in thickness, and three *chi* in length.\n**Front:**\n**Back:**",

      "translated_text": "In violation of the law—*Edict on Disputes and Admonitions* issued in the second year of Qianfeng under Emperor Gaozong of Tang:\n\nWe, having received the Mandate of Heaven and ruling over all under heaven, dare not but revere and exalt the Dao of Heaven to manifest Heaven’s virtue. Recently, Yang Taixuan, the Libationer of Haotian Abbey, and the monk Zongjing of Huayan Monastery have disputed over precedence, and though We have already admonished them, they still refuse to comply. We have examined the ancient canons and commanded scholars to assess their relative merits. Upon careful consideration of the precedence between Dao and Buddhism, and the weight accorded to Chinese and foreign teachings, We have weighed present circumstances against ancient principles, tracing reason to its source.\n\nFrom the perspective of Heaven and humanity: the Dao is the mother of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, while the Buddha attained enlightenment through cultivation of the Dao. The Dao is named after Heaven, whereas the Buddha is ranked among humans—who would dare place a human above Heaven and Earth?\n\nFrom the perspective of Chinese and foreign: the Daoist teaching was inaugurated by the Yellow Emperor and Laozi of Our Middle Kingdom, while Buddhism originated with the foreigner of Kapilavastu in the Western Regions. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi are the great sages of China, whereas the Buddha is but a virtuous man of the Western barbarians. Judged by the distinction between Chinese and foreign, how can an external teaching be placed above that of Our Middle Kingdom?\n\nFrom the perspective of temporal precedence: the Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, while Buddhism arose later and flourished afterward. The Dao began before Pangu, whereas the Buddha was born in the reign of King Zhuang of Zhou. Between them lie over three million seven thousand years—who would dare place the era of King Zhuang before that of Pangu?\n\nFrom the perspective of dynasties: the Dao was expounded in the age of the Yellow Emperor, while Buddhism emerged in the time of Emperor Ming of Han. The Dao preceded the Dragon and Horse, whereas Buddhism arrived at the end of the Metal Rabbit. How can one dare to exalt the Later Han and belittle the Yellow Emperor?\n\nMoreover, according to the old customs of the monastic community, precedence is determined by seniority: even a young monk who enters the temple first must be ranked above an elder who enters later. This is an unchanging principle of monastic discipline, a natural order of Heaven and Earth. Since the Dao precedes Buddhism, what doubt can there be?\n\nHenceforth, after this proclamation, both teachings shall abide by Our decree. Should any dare to disobey and persist in disputation, the gravest offenders shall be punished with the utmost severity, while lesser ones shall be sentenced to hard labor as *chengdan* and *zhong*. Let all officials enforce Our judgment.\n\n*Edict on Prohibiting Cliques and Evil* issued in the first year of Hongdao under Our humble virtue, We have inherited the grand enterprise and recognized that the failure to clarify teachings leads to abuses that endure for ten thousand generations. To know of abuses and not reform them is to share equal culpability. We have broadly sought the details of public opinion and established measures to uphold the great principles.\n\nIn the age of the Yellow Emperor, the transmission of the Daoist lineage was already established. By the end of the Han, the teachings of Buddhism first appeared. Their original purpose was to transform the violent into the benevolent and guide the wicked toward goodness. Yet how did matters come to this?\n\nIn the first year of Zhongping under Emperor Ling of Han, Zhang Jiao of Julu initially used talismanic water to treat illnesses, relieving suffering wherever he went—his methods were indeed effective and commendable. Within a year, people from all directions flocked to him. Zhang Jiao then became arrogant, coveting the imperial throne. He incited rebellion, styling himself the Grand Worthy Teacher and Heavenly General, while his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang were named Earthly General and Human General, respectively. They amassed over a thousand followers, all wearing yellow turbans as their insignia, and threw the realm into chaos. The very foundation of the Han nearly collapsed. After their defeat and capture, Zhang Jiao and his clique were executed.\n\nAmong the abuses of the Buddhist clergy: during the Tianjian era of the Liang, the monk Faqing and his disciple Li Guibo rebelled, with Faqing declaring himself the Emperor of the Great Vehicle and Li Guibo the Ten Abodes Bodhisattva, the Pacifier of Demons, and King of Han. Their warfare raged across thousands of *li*, with weapons blanketing the fields and conflict persisting for years. The people suffered as if scorched by fire, and the state teetered on the brink of collapse, nearly bringing ruin to the nation.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Taiwu of Wei, the Buddhist devotee Gai Wu and the monks of Chang’an Monastery usurped the title of emperor and rebelled. Upon discovery, they were executed.\n\nIn the Daye era of the Sui, dozens of bandits styled themselves as Maitreya Buddha, donning *kunlu* hats, burning incense, and carrying flowers. They stormed the Jianguomen Gate, seized weapons from the palace guards, and suddenly erupted into rebellion. As soldiers clashed in the palace courtyards, blood flowed upon the steps, nearly precipitating a great disaster—how terrifying!\n\nIn the first year of Wude under Our High Ancestor, the monk Gao Tansheng and five thousand fellow monks rebelled, declaring himself the Emperor of the Great Vehicle. The nun Zheng Xuan was named his Empress Yeshu, and he changed the era name to *Falun*. They attacked prefectures and counties, slaughtering officials and soldiers.\n\nMore recently, the monk Zhi Jue married the daughter of the Tao family to fulfill the \"peach and plum repentance,\" colluding with the Khitans to proclaim himself emperor. Another Buddhist devotee, Tie Yu, incited rebellion, declaring the advent of the Holy Buddha and styling himself the Radiant Great Sage Emperor. They killed government troops and burned civilian homes.\n\nFrom these examples, it is clear that the two teachings have brought no small calamity to the realm. We have examined the ancient records from the dawn of time to the present—spanning hundreds of thousands of years—and found that the Dao has committed but one offense, and its harm was minor. From the time of Emperor Ming of Han to the present, less than a thousand years have passed, yet the harms of Buddhism have been numerous and their rebellions severe.\n\nWe aspire to revive the customs of high antiquity and restore the governance of Fuxi and Shennong. Let the people of China follow the teachings of China, and the barbarians follow the teachings of the barbarians. We wish to sever the traces of foreign influence in China to prevent future disasters, to distinguish between the orthodox and the heterodox in the Dao, and to maintain the distinction between Chinese and foreign. How can one, with the heart of a sage, practice the teachings of foreign barbarians? How can We indulge them with leniency and refrain from abolishing them?\n\nHenceforth, the quotas for Daoist and Buddhist clergy shall be fixed. Should any dare to privately recruit disciples, harbor fugitives, deceive the good, or form cliques to imitate one another, they shall be seized by the people and delivered to the judicial authorities for investigation. If any act against the law, their entire clan shall be executed without mercy. Thus, this edict.",

      "translated_text": "**Court Audience Ritual**\n\nFor all court assemblies, the Celestial Master shall don the ritual vestments, wear the *fuyang* cap, and hold the inscribed tablet with tassels, as though standing before the Supreme Emperor. All Daoists, regardless of age or rank, shall wear robes of golden hem and the *Zhengyi* cap, holding inscribed tablets. On ordinary days when appearing before the emperor, they shall not hold tablets but wear plain robes, without distinction between Quanzhen and other traditions, their hemp sleeves as usual.\n\nConsider the example of Buddhist monks: regardless of age, rank, or status, all don golden-hemmed robes and cassocks. How then can Daoists, when entering court to see the sovereign, fail to observe proper ritual?\n\nSince the Han dynasty, the greatest taboo has been the *leijin* headwrap and short jacket. The short jacket is the garb of the vulgar masses; the *leijin*, the headwrap of rustics. Recluses in the mountains use it to cover their unkempt hair. Those who cultivate the Great Way preserve spirit and gather *qi*, uniting the Three Flowers at the *niwan* to guard against its opening, lest wind and evil assail it. How can one wear a *leijin* to court? Such conduct is deemed irreverent.\n\nTo leave the household is named for the hairpin and cap. To forgo the hairpin and cap in favor of a *leijin*—is this proper? Only the shallow and ostentatious would do so; those of pure virtue would never abandon the ritual of hairpin and cap. Formerly, Duke Zhuang of Zheng killed his son Zang because his cap was askew. Thus did Confucius begin the *Spring and Autumn Annals* with this account. All who belong to the Daoist tradition must take heed.\n\nSee also the chapter on \"Regulations for Robes and Ritual Attire.\"\n\nAccording to a directive issued by the Central Secretariat in the fourth year of Zhongtong (1263) to all circuit branch secretariats: Since the collapse of the Song and the chaos that engulfed the realm, ritual and law have yet to be fully restored, and those who remain obstinate in their ways are none other than Buddhist monks and Daoists. Upon examination, monks take tonsure as their practice, while Daoists leave the household by wearing the hairpin and cap. Yet today, when monks meet their superiors or teachers upon entering a temple, they remove their hats, but when entering the palace gate, they do not remove them—only before the sovereign do they doff their hats. Is this proper ritual?\n\nMoreover, since ancient times, Buddhist and Daoist officials have had no precedent for wearing caps and sashes; their office is marked solely by tonsure or the hairpin and cap. Even the Three Dukes and Six Ministers remove their caps and kowtow before the sovereign. Those who have left the household to cultivate the Way take humility as their foremost virtue and modesty as their power. How can they refuse to remove their hats, acting with arrogance and self-importance?\n\nHenceforth, any monk or Daoist who fails to remove their hat when meeting an official shall receive seventeen strokes of the cane and be returned to lay life. Those who fail to remove their hats when entering court shall receive seventy strokes and be exiled to Tubo. As for attire:\n\nDaoists shall not wear Mongol-style sleeveless jackets but shall don the caps and robes of the Yellow Emperor’s lineage. Monks shall not adopt Tang-style dress, nor wear the lascivious robes of Empress Wu or the *kunlu* hat. Ordained monks shall wear the red woolen robes of the Western Regions; Chan monks shall wear the black cloth robes of Emperor Wu of Liang, and shall not don garments of silk, damask, gauze, or brocade.\n\nNuns shall be permitted only the attire of female Daoists. Neither lay nor ordained women shall be allowed to live in communal cloisters. Those who conceal male monks, blurring distinctions between male and female, and thus spread licentiousness—leading to the discovery of infant corpses and skeletal remains piled in rear gardens—have been numerous. Such depravity corrupts public morals and must be strictly prohibited. Those who dare persist in such violations shall be executed.\n\n1. **Morning and Evening Hall Services**\n   The bell and drum shall be sounded for morning and evening assemblies. The morning service shall begin at first light, the evening service after sunset. Daoists shall first strike the assembly drum to gather the community, then burn incense and recite scriptures once through. After two bows, they shall withdraw. Those who fail to attend shall be fined five *jin* of oil, equivalent to fifty prostrations. Those who spread dissent or refuse to comply shall be fined ten *jin* of oil, equivalent to one hundred prostrations. Those who persist in defiance shall be flogged forty times before the assembly, barred from communal meals and lodging, and their rations withheld for one year.\n\n2. **Discipline for Daoists**\n   For minor transgressions, Daoists shall be penalized with offerings of incense or lamps. For graver offenses, they shall be flogged. If they persist after flogging, they shall be assigned to kitchen duties or labor in the gardens. If they transgress again, they shall be reduced to latrine attendants, tasked with cutting rods for latrine use, for a term of one or two years, until they reform.\n\n3. **Expulsion for Grave Offenses**\n   For Daoists guilty of repeated or severe misconduct—such as refusing instruction, violating monastic rules, theft, harm, or violent and unbenevolent acts—the gravest penalty shall be permanent expulsion from their home abbey. Their offenses shall be recorded in the abbey’s registry for posterity.\n\n4. **Welcoming Wandering Daoists**\n   When wandering Daoists, drawn by the excellence of mountains and rivers or the numinosity of blessed lands, seek to cultivate the Dao at an abbey, their needs shall be provided for equally with resident Daoists. No distinctions shall be made. Those who spread slander, defame others, or stir up discord shall receive twenty strokes of the cane and be demoted to work as estate laborers, barred from entering the abbey.\n\n5. **Hospitality to Itinerant Daoists**\n   When wandering Daoists arrive at an abbey, they shall be hosted for ten days, with all necessities provided without fail.

The Yellow Emperor offered sacrifices to the Supreme Deity at the *Haotian Gong* (Palace of the Vast Heaven) and to the Three Pure Ones at the *Taiji Tiangong* (Palace of the Great Ultimate Heaven). Thus, when the Yellow Emperor received the Mandate of Heaven, all subsequent rulers who governed the realm were said to \"serve Heaven and uphold the celestial mandate\"—this marks the origin of *gong*.\n\nThe term *guan* (观) combines *xia yang shang* (下仰上, \"gazing upward from below\") and *yin guan xia* (音贯, \"overseeing from above\"). It denotes the halls where emperors administered governance, such as the *Mingtang* (Hall of Illumination), embodying the principle of \"residing on high to oversee below\"—hence the term *guan*. According to the *Inner Biography of the Yellow Emperor*, the Queen Mother of the West bestowed upon the Emperor the Primordial True Form of the White Jade Yuan Shi, which was placed atop a lofty *guan*—this marks the origin of *guan*.\n\nThe term *dian* (殿) is explained in the *Yanyi*: \"Dian means *fa* (法, 'model' or 'standard').\" It signifies the central structure among clustered halls, resolving doubts as noted by Zhi Yu. The *Yaozhu* states: \"A *dian* has steps and a raised platform, while a *tang* (堂) has steps but no platform.\" The *Spring and Autumn Annals* refers to it as *luzin* (路寝), and both the *Book of Rites* and *Baihu Tong* call it \"the hall of the Son of Heaven.\" The *Records of the Grand Historian* notes that Qin Shi Huang constructed the *Chaogong* (朝宫) south of the Wei River, beginning with the *Qiandian* (前殿) and *Efang* (阿房). The *Book of Lord Shang* also mentions \"the *dian* of the Son of Heaven,\" indicating that this designation existed as early as the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin. The Qin dynasty, like the sun, had its *dian*. Later generations, when worshipping the Celestial Emperor, established halls such as the *Jinque Liaoyang Baodian* (Golden Watchtower of the Luminous Yang Treasure Hall), *Wuji Baodian* (Infinite Treasure Hall), and *Taiji Dian* (Hall of the Great Ultimate), with countless names—this marks the origin of *dian*.\n\nThe term *ge* (阁) is mentioned in the *Han Shi Waizhuan*: \"During the time of the Yellow Emperor, the phoenix nested in the *A Ge* (阿阁).\" Thus, *ge* also originated with the Yellow Emperor. Later generations built halls to worship the Celestial Emperor, constructing *ge* such as the *Tongming Ge* (Hall of Universal Illumination), *Zixu Ge* (Purple Void Hall), and *Yuhuang Ge* (Jade Emperor Hall)—this marks the origin of *ge*. I myself have built the *Shouxing Ge* (Hall of the Star of Longevity) and *Tianhuang Ge* (Celestial August Hall) at the *Changsheng Gong* (Palace of Longevity) to pray for the people’s well-being and bountiful harvests.\n\nThe term *lou* (楼) is recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian*, where fangshi (方士) told Emperor Wu of Han: \"The Yellow Emperor constructed the Five Cities and Twelve Towers to await divine beings.\" The Emperor then ascended the *Ganlou* (干楼). Thus, *lou* likely originated in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Later generations, when worshipping the Celestial Emperor, built many *lou* in abbeys and halls, such as the *Zhonggu Lou* (Bell and Drum Tower) and *Qizhen Lou* (Tower of Perfected Immortals)—this marks the origin of *lou*.\n\nThe *Daozang* (道藏, Daoist Canon) began when Laozi served as the *Shoucang Shi* (Keeper of the Archives) for King Wen of Zhou, storing books in the Eastern *Guan*. Later Daoist traditions all maintained *Daozang* collections of scriptures. Master Lupi constructed a rotating wheel suspended in a *ge*, which would sound bells and drums when moved. Inside, it housed scriptures, while the exterior was carved with images of celestial deities—this marks its origin. Later generations established repositories such as the *Yunzhang Baoshi* (Cloud Seal Treasure Chamber) and *Tianzhang Baocang* (Celestial Seal Treasure Repository), as well as the *Feitian Falun* (Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel)—this marks the origin of *zang* (藏). I have renamed the *Zang Dian* (Repository Hall) as the *Zongji Dian* (Hall of the Turning Mechanism), signifying its operation of the celestial Dao, like the *Xuanji* (璇玑) and *Yuheng* (玉衡), to align with the heavens.\n\nThe term *tang* (堂) refers to the *Yanfa Tang* (Hall of Dharma Exposition) built by Daoist priests (*yuliu*) for celestial *jiao* (醮, ritual offerings). The hall was arranged with six curtains, within which the six masters were seated to preside over the ritual—this marks the origin of *tang*. I have renamed it the *Taixuan Dian* (Hall of the Great Mystery).\n\nThe term *Tianguan* (天关, Celestial Gate) originates with me. I established the *Yuchen Tianguan* (Jade August Celestial Gate) at the *Nanji Changsheng Gong* (Southern Culmen Palace of Longevity), with the Four Celestial August Lords arrayed on either side: the first, *Chengtian Fuxiao Qingling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Azure Numen, Assistant to Heaven and Teacher of the Dao); the second, *Anbang Zhuguo Haoling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Radiant Numen, Pillar of the State and Protector of the Realm); the third, *Baozhen Guozuo Danling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Cinnabar Numen, Guardian of the State and Stabilizer of the Mandate); and the fourth, *Zhiyu Wanshen Xuanling Dijun* (Celestial August Lord of the Mysterious Numen, Controller of the Myriad Spirits). Before the gate, two couplets are inscribed:\n*\"The celestial gates swing open, as immortals from the Three Realms come to pay homage to Heaven;*\n*The vault of heaven clears, as the Four Numinous Lords stand in attendance.\"*\n\nThe term *Tianmen* (天门, Gate of Heaven) is recorded in the *Huangtu Yaoji*: \"The Yellow Emperor created doors and windows.\" Thus, the construction of doors and windows followed the establishment of roofs and eaves, serving to open and close at dawn and dusk to ward off violence—hence the term *men* (门). Ancient designs featured pairs of Dragon and Tiger Lords or Celestial Ding (天丁). In my own designs, any gate with Celestial Ding or Dragon and Tiger Lords is called *Tianguan*, while those without are called *Tianmen*, as they serve as the place to worship the Supreme Deity and the Two Pure Ones, situated within the realm of the *Tailuo Yuqing* (太罗玉清, Great Net of Jade Purity). Thus, they are named *Tianmen*. The unenlightened common folk mistakenly call them *Shanmen* (山门, Mountain Gate) or *Sanmen* (三门, Triple Gate), which strays far from the Dao.\n\nThe *Boting* (钵堂, Alms Bowl Hall) is where Daoist companions (*luánchóu hèlǚ*) from the four directions gather to lodge. Since ancient times, it has existed in sacred mountains and immortal sites. I constructed a *Boting* at the *Nanji Changsheng Gong*, naming it the *Bingzhen Guan* (Hall of Perfected Immortals’ Lodging). Its name is inscribed on the lintel, with a couplet:\n*\"All cloud-roaming and water-wandering immortals dwell here;*\n*The foremost of the Perfected in the world reside within this first gate.\"*\n\nAbove the front veranda hangs a plaque reading *\"Hualing Yinai\"* (华灵隐霭, \"Misty Veil of the Flourishing Numen\"). The veranda’s pillars bear couplets:\n*\"Expounding the great Dao of the sages of China;*\n*Inheriting the legacy of the immortals of the heavens above.\"*\n\nIn the center of the veranda stands a plaque for opening and closing the gate. Within, an image of Perfected Wang Chongyang is enshrined, with a table displaying the Five Phases (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) to harmonize their transformations. Seven golden lotuses are arranged in front to symbolize the profound mystery of the Seven Perfected. A *Bojia* (钵架, alms bowl stand) is placed in the center, with a water cauldron below and five bells and one alms bowl suspended above. The stand bears a couplet:\n*\"When the five bells chime in unison, the gate of the Great Ultimate swings wide;*\n*When the single bowl briefly rests, one re-enters the chamber of the Great Mystery.\"*\n\nOn either side, fourteen seats are arranged in pairs, each designated by the cyclical signs *zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, si, wu, wei, shen, you, xu,* and *hai*. The hall’s pillars display couplets:\n*\"Silently paying homage to the Supreme Deity, ascending to the Golden Watchtower;*\n*Quietly guarding the Central Yellow, sealing the Jade Gate.\"*\n\nThere are two side chambers: the left is called *Hechao* (鹤巢, Crane’s Nest), and the right is called *Linsou* (麟薮, Unicorn’s Marsh).",

They may not be allowed to stay long, but their details must still be recorded in the register, lest the abbey be implicated in harboring fugitives.

      "translated_text": "Within are fourteen cloud beds, fully furnished with all necessities for daily practice—robes, ritual implements, and utensils for vegetarian meals—prepared to accommodate itinerant Daoist adepts. Those who establish alms halls should take this as their model.\n\n**Enclosed Chamber (圓室)**\nConstructed of brick, the chamber measures one *zhang* in diameter, with no door, only a small aperture for passing food. At the rear, a hole is left for waste disposal. When a Daoist enters, the opening is sealed with bricks—this is called *closing the pass*. After a hundred days of seclusion, the seal is removed—this is called *opening the pass*. Such is the design of the enclosed chamber.\n\nZhang Daoling, a descendant of Han Dynasty Marquis of Liu (Zhang Liang) from Pei’s Fengyi district, was originally a scholar of the Imperial Academy. Having passed the examinations for *Xianliang Fangzheng* (Worthy and Upright) and *Zhiyan Jijian* (Candid Remonstrance), he later lamented, *\"This does nothing to prolong life.\"* He then pursued the Dao of longevity, mastering the *Nine Cauldrons Elixir Method* of the Yellow Emperor. Entering Mount Heming in Shu, he sat in the enclosed chamber, refining his will and composing twenty-four scrolls of Daoist scripture. After three years, his elixir complete, he told his disciple Wang Chang: *\"The divine elixir, when consumed, must ascend to heaven. Yet I must first benefit the nation and relieve the people’s suffering, serving the Three Realms—only then will I be without shame.\"* The Emperor, hearing of his virtue, appointed him Grand Tutor and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Jixian. On the ninth day of the ninth month in the first year of *Yongshou* (155 CE), he ascended to heaven with his wife, Lady Yong. The enclosed chamber originated with him.\n\n**Hermitage (庵)**\nKuang Xu, a descendant of the Xia Emperor Yu, had five brothers, all born with divine intelligence. The eldest was named Xu Zhou. During King Wu’s reign, he and Laozi served together as *Zhuxia* historians, receiving Laozi’s teachings. He later withdrew to Xunyang, where three brothers built huts on Tianchi Peak, and two on Tiger Creek. Upon achieving transcendence, the mountain was named *Kuanglu* (Mount Lu). Emperor Wu of Han enfeoffed him as *Daming Jun* (Lord of Great Brilliance). The present dynasty later changed *Jun* to *Gong* (Duke). Thus began the hermitage.\n\nLater, reclusive scholars and those who attained the Dao built thatched huts among cliffs and ravines, following this tradition. I, too, have emulated this design, constructing a thatched hut on the southern peak of Mount Xialing. The land produces *lingzhi* mushrooms, so I named it *Zhi An* (Mushroom Hermitage). Its couplet reads:\n*\"I dwell beyond the world, apart from the vulgar;*\n*Who believes this hut holds another heaven?\"*\n\nInside the hermitage, another couplet hangs:\n*\"A room no larger than a bushel, yet the heart spans the heavens;*\n*In silent sitting, spirit congeals—profound thoughts touch the mysterious workings.\"*\n\nBelow the hermitage stands the *White Cloud Elixir Chamber*. Its couplet declares:\n*\"Grasping white clouds to refine the Great Return;*\n*Fleeing the red dust to become a minor recluse—*\n*awaiting one of the Dao to dwell here.\"*\n\nThe path begins south of the *Feisheng* (Ascension) Terrace, west of Ling Peak, winding through a grove of pines and cedars. Upon arrival, a plaque reads: *\"Deep Within the White Clouds.\"* Its couplet proclaims:\n*\"A gourd contains a small heaven and earth;\"*",

Thus, I have established the *Feisheng* (Ascension) Terrace atop the *Xialing* Grotto-Heaven’s *Xialing* Peak, awaiting those who attain the Dao and join the ranks of immortals—surely they shall mount this terrace to ascend. Upon the terrace’s ancient pillars hangs this couplet:\n*\"Ninefold elixir perfected, one step soars to the Purple Ultimate;*\n*Great Return refined, the body leaps straight to the Azure Heavens.\"*\n\n**Temple**\nThe term *temple* denotes the rank of the Six Ministers, the station of a court official, where the *dafu* (grand master) resides. Thus, the Qin established the *Taichang* Temple to preside over the rites of heaven’s worship. Emperor Wu of Han appointed the Daoist Ling Taichong as *Taichang* Minister, renaming the *Taichang* Temple as *Chengtian* Temple to venerate the Supreme Emperor. From then on, Daoist priests served as *Taichang* officials to oversee sacrificial rites. Additionally, a *jijiu* (libationer) was appointed to manage *jiao* (offering) affairs, and the *Chengtian* Temple became the official residence of Daoist priests.\n\n**Shrine**\nThe shrines of Daoist ancient sages began with the shrine of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign on Mount Emei. Of old, there were the Three Mountain Shrines. On Mount Emei in Shu, the palace of the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign once stood. At Tianchi and Huxi of Mount Lu in Xunyang, the two shrines of the Great Illuminated Lords were located. On the Five Terraces Mountain of Jin, there were two shrines: one was the palace of the Purple Mansion’s Gate Lord, and the other was the palace where Wang Zijin’s younger brother, Meishou, cultivated the Dao. Each of the Three Mountains possessed luminous stones that, when struck by sunlight amidst white clouds, emitted rays of five colors. After the Five Barbarians’ chaos in the Central Plains, these lands were thrown into turmoil. Because of their radiance, the stones were seized by Shi Le and Yao Chang to build barbarian temples, and thus the Three Mountain shrines of China’s divine beings were extinguished.\n\n**Abode**\nThe Heavenly Perfected had the *Xuanguan* (Mystic Lodge).",

Thus, modeling heaven, emulating earth, and reflecting the majesty of the world, one ensures that reverence prevails in all directions.\"\n\nAll altars and sacred grounds are constructed in three tiers, reflecting the distinction between the exalted heaven and the humble earth.\n\nThe upper tier is established as the Heavenly Treasure Flower Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain of the Vacuous August, where the Three Treasures and Imperial Masters are enshrined. To the left, the banner of the Heavenly Perfected and Life-Demolishing Deity is erected; to the right, the standard of the Lion and Evil-Repelling Deity is raised. On the far left, talismans for communicating with the perfected are placed to summon a thousand truths; on the far right, talismans for reaching the numinous are set to invoke ten thousand spirits. In the center, talismans of the Three Mornings are arranged to circulate the myriad *qi* and dispel malevolent vapors.\n\nTo the east of the altar, the Azure Dragon banner is planted; to the west, the White Tiger banner talisman; to the south, the Vermilion Bird banner talisman; and to the north, the Dark Warrior banner talisman. In the five directions, stabilizing jade talismans are also laid. This constitutes the upper tier.\n\nIf three tiers are not used, the arrangement may be set within a hall or palace according to the directions.\n\nThe middle tier establishes eight gates:\n- Northwest: the Gate of Cloudy Jade Vacuity for Communicating with the Perfected\n- Due north: the Gate of Clear and Cold Mysterious Unity\n- Northeast: the Gate of Tranquil and Natural Stability\n- Due east: the Gate of Azure Florescence and Primordial Birth\n- Southeast: the Gate of Pure Harmony and Vigorous Yang\n- Due south: the Gate of Pure Yang’s Radiant Brilliance\n- Southwest: the Gate of Earth’s Compliance and Metallic Harmony\n- Due west: the Gate of Firm Clarity and Luminous Splendor\n\nThe lower tier arranges the twelve *qi*:\n- *Zi* position: the *qi* of Dark Heaven’s Gathering Beginning\n- *Chou* position: the *qi* of Northern Primordial Naturalness\n- *Yin* position: the *qi* of Dispelling Wrong and Sweeping Away Evil\n- *Mao* position: the *qi* of Primordial Flourishing Azure\n- *Chen* position: the *qi* of Yellow Numinosity and Lofty Mystery\n- *Si* position: the *qi* of Tranquil Numinosity and Serene Peace\n- *Wu* position: the *qi* of Fiery Perfection’s Descending Brilliance\n- *Wei* position: the *qi* of Central Unity and Congealed Perfection\n- *Shen* position: the *qi* of Profound Harmony and Solemn Clarity\n- *You* position: the *qi* of Firm Solidity and Pristine Harmony\n- *Xu* position: the *qi* of True Primordial Nurturing Spirit\n- *Hai* position: the *qi* of Returning Yin and Reverting to Perfection\n\nWith these three tiers, the altar is complete.\n\nThe establishment of the Imperial Altar is not solely for delivering sentient beings. It is also used for submitting petitions and requesting mandates, paying homage to the sages and attending the perfected, averting disasters and repenting transgressions, praying for longevity and seeking blessings for the state and the people, recommending and elevating ancestral spirits, refining and delivering the departed, and beseeching heaven through the construction of jiao rites. All such matters should employ it.\n\n*Illustration of the Three-Tiered Imperial Altar*\n*Protocol for Revering the Sages*",

Earth is called *qi* because it receives the numinous essence of heaven, earth, seas, and mountains, embodying the wonder of spontaneity, hence the name *qi*. Humans are called *gui* because all mortals, upon death, are termed *gui*. Even those who cultivate the Dao and attain perfection cannot escape death, leaving dry bones among the living. Though exalted, are they not ultimately still called *lower ghosts*? Thus, they are termed *gui*.\n\nThe supreme spirits of the heavens are honored as *Heavenly Venerables*.\n\n**Yuanshi Tianzun (Primordial Heavenly Venerable)**\nThe Lord of Creation, the origin of all beings. His true name is unknowable; Laozi provisionally called him the *Dao*.

Lacking a proper name, it is called *Haotian* (Vast Heaven).

Lacking a proper name, the Yellow Emperor honored her as *Houtu Huangdiqi* (August Deity of Earth).\n\n**Sun**\nThe Yellow Emperor honored him as *Taiyang Dijun* (Great Yang Emperor Lord).\n\n**Moon**\nThe Yellow Emperor honored her as *Taiyin Huangjun* (Great Yin August Lord).\n\n**Beichen (Northern Culmen)**\nThe pivot of heaven, master of all phenomena. All stars revolve around it, occupying the *zi* position, hence the title *Beichen* (Northern Culmen).\n\n**Five Directions and Five Emperors**\nHeaven has five stars corresponding to the Five Phases.

      "translated_text": "**Sacred Images in China**\n\nIn China, divine images were traditionally carved from jade—such as the white jade likeness of the Primordial True Countenance placed in the lofty observatory by the Yellow Emperor. Later generations, lacking jade, resorted to clay sculpture. As clay corresponds to the central earth, it is adorned with the five colors to encompass the attributes of the five directions, thereby rectifying the *qi* of the Middle Kingdom.\n\nImages of deities of the eastern direction are carved from wood, while those of the western direction are cast in metal. Images of the southern direction also employ wood, for wood is born of fire. Images of the northern direction are likewise cast in metal, as metal is born of water. All take their forms from their respective correspondences.\n\n**Sacred Thrones**\nThe throne of sacred images follows the style of a dragon couch. The screen behind it features dragon heads with mouths holding five-colored knotted silks. The screens must depict a single dragon in full relief; floral or abstract patterns are forbidden. The proper form must adhere to the Chinese tradition.\n\nIn the Hall of the Three Clarities, the Nine Chen and Nine Emperors should be sculpted on either side. In the Hall of the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors should be placed on both sides. On the walls of these two halls, the assembly of the Ten Thousand Sages paying homage to the Primordial should be painted.\n\nIn the Hall of the Dark Emperor, the various deities of the Thunder Department should be sculpted on either side. On the walls within, the deeds of the Dark Emperor’s cultivation of the Dao should be depicted.\n\nIn the Hall of the Perfected Lord Xu, the ranks of immortals should be sculpted on either side. On the walls within, scenes of ascending to heaven with one’s entire household—riding simurghs and cranes, mounting the wind and commanding dragons, or floating among immortal companions—should be painted.\n\nIn the halls of temples and observatories dedicated to prayers for longevity, the central position should be occupied by the Great Emperor of Longevity. To his left, the Heavenly Venerable of Longevity and Life-Preservation; to his right, the Heavenly Venerable of Lifespan Extension and Destiny Augmentation. On either side, the Southern and Northern Dippers should be placed—on the left, the Southern Dipper for destiny augmentation, and on the right, the Northern Dipper for life extension. The Southern Dipper’s six deities should be complemented by the Star of Longevity to make seven, corresponding to the Northern Dipper.\n\nIn the Pavilion of the Star of Longevity, the Stars of Fortune and Emolument should be placed above, with the image of the Star of Longevity sculpted below.\n\n**Dragon Tablets**\nDaoist dragon tablets should not be ornately carved. I have reformed their design, making them solid and carved in the manner of jade, with the dragon fully visible on the exterior, its spine forming the border. Gold dragons and five-colored clouds are used to signify the virtue of encompassing the five directions. This innovation is my own.\n\n**Tortoise and Crane Censers**\nOn either side of the cinnabar steps, pairs of tortoise and crane censers—cast in bronze or iron—should be placed. For all jiao rituals, incense is burned within them to communicate with the immortals, allowing the fragrance to ascend to the heavens above.\n\n**Banners**\nThe banners used in Daoist rites symbolize the Three Powers of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. I have reformed their ancient design: the finial is made of paulownia or catalpa wood, adorned with the sun, moon, stars, clouds, and rosy dawn, with an image of the Heavenly Venerable painted above to represent Heaven. The body of the banner bears the names of the Heavenly Emperors, while the base features dragons and phoenixes. The side streamers, shaped like hands, are embellished with flying dragons and phoenixes among clouds, representing Humanity. The pendants, also made of paulownia or catalpa wood, depict mountains, rivers, the great earth, the Five Peaks, and the Four Waterways, representing Earth. Such a design was never seen in antiquity; it originates with me. The common practice of using lotus leaves for finials and lotus flowers for pendants is exceedingly vulgar.\n\n**Sun and Moon Lamps**\nBetween the pillars of every hall, fish-shaped lamps should be suspended, enveloped in clouds and mist, rising high between the architrave and crossbeam. The left lamp, colored red, symbolizes the sun; the right, white, symbolizes the moon. This innovation is also my own.\n\n**Offering Flowers**\nFlowers for offerings are carved from paulownia wood in the form of *lingzhi* mushrooms, symbolizing the auspicious tokens of immortality. A peony stem with five-colored blossoms, nine feet tall and adorned with gold thread, evokes the legend of Han Xiangzi, whose flowers instantly bloomed in five colors—a sign of immortal auspiciousness.\n\n**Offerings of the Five Phases**\nThe five offerings—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—symbolize the generative and restraining cycles of Heaven and Earth’s creation, aligning with the virtue of the divine.\n- **Metal**: Cast in copper or iron ingots, gilded with gold foil. Pure gold is avoided for fear of theft.\n- **Wood**: Represented by incense, carved into miniature mountains for display.\n- **Water**: Sacred water, contained in a vessel.\n- **Fire**: Represented by lamps.\n- **Earth**: Yellow soil shaped into a cube with eight facets, carved with the Eight Trigrams for display.\n\n**Offering Fruits**\nFruits for offerings should be carved from wood: peaches of longevity, intertwined pears, fiery jujubes, plums from the Dark Garden, and melons from Kunlun.\n\n**Incense Offerings**\n*Jiangzhen* incense is the sacred incense for worshipping the Heavenly Emperor. Apart from this, *chenxiang* and *suxiang* are secondary. *Xinling* incense can convey one’s sincerity to the Heavenly Emperor. Incense to be avoided includes benzoin, frankincense, and sandalwood—foreign concoctions forbidden by celestial law. Utmost caution is required.\n\n**Ingredients for Xinling Incense**\n- *Jiangzhen* (5 *qian*)\n- *Yujin* (5 *qian*)\n- *Chenxiang* (5 *qian*)\n- *Suxiang* (5 *qian*)\n- *Leixiang* (8 *qian*)\n- *Gaoben* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Gansong* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Baizhi* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Lingling* (1.6 *liang*)\n- *Dahuang* (2 *qian*)\n- *Xiangfu* (2 *qian*)\n- *Xuanshen* (2 *qian*)\n\nTo compound the incense, on the day before the *jiazi* day, arrange the ingredients in a quiet chamber designated for incense preparation. Set up the tablets of the Five *Zi* Deities, and offer incense and lamps with utmost purity. The five deities presiding are:\n- The Spirit of *Jiazi*\n- The Spirit of *Bingzi*\n- The Spirit of *Wuzi*\n- The Spirit of *Gengzi*\n- The Spirit of *Renzi*\n\n**Method for Compounding Xinling Incense**\n- On the *jiazi* day: Gather the ingredients.\n- On the *bingzi* day: Grind them.\n- On the *wuzi* day: Mix them together.\n- On the *gengzi* day: Form them into pellets.\n- Offer them upon the Heavenly Altar on the *renzi* day.\n- On the following *jia* day, store them in gourds and hang them up.\n\nThereafter, burn one pellet daily to worship Heaven. This incense is not for common use; in times of urgent prayer, burning it can invoke the virtue of the divine. If one encounters peril on the road—such as bandits, storms at sea, or other dangers—and lacks fire, chew the incense and spit it upward to avert calamity.\n\n**Celestial Music and Regalia**\nCelestial music refers to the orchestral arrangements in the hall. Its origins trace back to the time when the Yellow Emperor convened the assembly of spirits on the western slopes of Kunlun. He commanded Ling Lun to gather bamboo from the Valley of Slackening and craft panpipes, flutes, and reed pipes to summon the phoenix.",

      "translated_text": "The phoenix cried out. He forged bells and chimes to harmonize the pitch-pipes and determine the intercalary months of the year. Taking the hide of Kui, he made drums to offer to the Heavenly Emperor. Then, combining the zither and sehtar crafted by Fuxi, he composed music, whereupon all the spirits gathered, the beasts danced in unison, and the phoenix came in pairs. By the time of Emperor Yao’s grand sacrifice at the Round Mound to worship the Heavenly Emperor, the ancient rites had faded with time, losing their original essence. Emperor Wu of Han then commanded the musician Hou Tiao to craft the konghou harp to match the celestial sounds, revising the music. Later, Daoist masters were ordered to perform the grand *Celestial Music* in the Palace of Vast Heaven to worship the Three Pure Ones, naming it *Music of the Three Pure Ones*.\n\n**Hymn of the Three Pure Ones’ Celestial Music**\nGazing up at the Dragon Chariot of the Vast Heavens,\nThe Emperor descends to the Jade Palace.\nRainbow banners and feathered canopies follow the celestial beings;\nYour servant leads the feathered immortals below to offer reverence.\nWitness my sincerity, as my devotion ascends;\nI bow my head in homage, praying for the longevity of the people.\nMay the imperial legacy endure for ten thousand generations,\nAnd the kingdom’s prosperity and blessings know no end.\nWith this precious incense, I supplicate the boundless heavens,\nUniversally offering to the Heavenly Sovereign.\nA wisp of auspicious smoke coils upward;\nThe people lift their voices in hope of eternal grace.\n\n**Instruments of the Music**\n- *Drum of Thunderous Assembly*: The grand *fengfeng* drum.\n- *Key of Azure Sky’s Resonance*: The great bell.\n- *Bell of Ten Thousand Gold’s Echo*: Sixteen pitch-responsive bells on the rack.\n- *Chime of Jade and Lapis*: Sixteen pitch-responsive chimes on the rack.\n- *Cluster of Luminous Jade from the Jasper Pool*: The *taotao* drum.\n- *Chime of Truth-Permeating Clarity*: The hand chime.\n- *Golden Bell of Jade Sky*: The golden bell.\n- *Jade Chime of the Jade Pure Heaven*: The jade chime.\n- *Zither of Grand Harmony by Taihao*: The zither.\n- *Pipe of Cloud-Quelling Jade*: The reed pipe.\n- *Sehtar of the Xiang Spirit’s Ethereal Clarity*: The sehtar.\n- *Flute of Celestial Immortal Sounds*: A harp-like instrument with coiled strings.\n- *Ruan of Moonlit Jasper Terrace*: The ruan.\n- *Cymbals of the Roaring Dragon and Commanding Crow*: The cymbals.\n- *Pipes of Azure Flower Jade Heaven*: The sheng.\n- *Flute of Cloud-Soaring Wind*: The flute.\n- *Drum of the Wind-Roaring Celestial Alligator*: The hand drum, called *Jade Rite*.\n- *Clappers of Jasper Terrace’s Jade*: The jade clappers.\n- *Gong of Red Sky’s Resonance*: The gong.\n- *Filler of Harmonious Tones*: The *tian* (sound-filling instrument).\n- *Curtain of Grand Harmony’s Preservation*: The *lian* (harmony-preserving screen).\n- *Prayer of Five Tones’ Concord*: The prayer of harmonized notes.\n- *Yue of Eight Tones’ Ninefold Completion*: The *yu* (wooden tiger).\n\nThis was the music used by the Yellow Emperor to worship the Three Pure Ones. Today, only bells, drums, sheng, xiao, *yun’ao*, and *xianlai* are employed. It is used when ascending the altar to pay homage to the Perfected and audience the Emperor, while for daily rituals and scripture recitations, ordinary immortal music suffices.\n\n**Emperor’s Bell**\nWhen the Yellow Emperor convened the spirits on Kunlun’s peak, the Heavenly Emperor bestowed upon him the *Emperor’s Bell*. Daoists speak of \"grasping the Emperor’s Bell, hurling fire for ten thousand miles, and ringing the bells of the eight directions.\" The Heavenly Soldiers wield it, also calling it the *Fire Bell*. During Emperor Daizong’s reign, the Hu monk Amoghavajra held the *Ullambana* assembly and replaced the chime with the Daoist *Emperor’s Bell*, later modifying its head for use as a bell.\n\n**Cymbals and Handbells**\nWhen Chiyou drove tigers and leopards to battle the Yellow Emperor, the latter forged cymbals and handbells to defeat them, for the beasts feared their sound. They also startle and dispel demons. During Empress Wu’s reign, the monk Huaiyi claimed that during the Buddha’s lifetime, demons—led by Mara—had hidden, served poisoned meals, dug fire pits, smeared the Buddha with filth and blood, and trampled him with elephants. The Buddha sought to destroy them, but the demons declared, \"Our kind is vast; we shall later destroy your Way.\" Thus, Huaiyi used cymbals and handbells in every ritual to startle and expel demons. Empress Wu remarked, \"Though cymbals can frighten demons, how can the souls of our ancestors be summoned to partake in offerings? If even demons are startled, how much more so ghosts?\" She ordered Daoist rites for the living and the dead to employ them, but their use should be strictly prohibited.\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected Sovereign said: \"Once, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded the mysterious and wondrous Dharma Gate of the Numinous Treasure, delivering the method of transcendence. He assembled the immortals at the Terrace of Heavenly Treasure in the Void Star Heaven. The celestial processions thronged, with the sun, moon, and stars, the jade armillary sphere, divine beasts, phoenixes, vermilion chariots, green carriages, banners, canopies, and rainbow flags all in attendance. Those who perform the Dao, establishing altars and steps, follow the celestial rites to deliver the people of the lower world. I once witnessed in the void the feathered banners, crimson tassels, dragon flags, and phoenix chariots of the heavenly beings. Emulating their form, I reformed the ancient methods and created the *Immortal Regalia*. Below are their depictions:\n\n- *Banners of the Purified Yellow Path*: One pair\n- *Banners of Proclaiming to the Myriad Spirits*: One pair\"",

He commanded Ling Lun to gather bamboo from the Valley of Slackening and craft panpipes, flutes, and reed pipes to summon the phoenix.",

Within a year, only two bowl-sitting periods are observed, as the summer months are too hot for practice.\n\nOutside the bowl hall, a *yunban* (cloud-shaped gong) and a *muyu* (wooden fish drum) are placed. On either side of the central hall, single mats are arranged for sitting, with two small bells positioned in front: the right is called the \"movement bell,\" and the left the \"stillness bell.\" Each day at the *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* hours, when the appointed time arrives, the assembly enters the hall and takes their seats, awaiting the designated attendant’s strikes to signal the opening and closing of the session, as well as the order of movement and stillness. The daily ritual for entering the hall and taking one’s seat is described below.\n\nA signboard for opening and closing the hall is placed outside the door, inscribed with red characters on a gold plaque. When the senior practitioner is seated, the characters for \"closing the hall\" face outward, and no one may enter. Upon concluding the session, the sound of the *yunban* serves as the signal, and the characters for \"opening the hall\" are turned outward.\n\n**Method for Determining the Bowl-Sitting Period**\nOn clear, sunny days, the bowl is first placed atop the water vessel, and the sundial is used to mark the time. When the shadow just reaches the initial quarter of the *wu* hour, the bowl is set upon the water vessel. By the time the *wu* hour transitions into the *wei* hour—specifically the initial quarter of *wei*—the bowl must sink, causing the five bells to chime in unison, thus marking the full hour before the session may conclude. If the bowl fails to sink at the appointed time, slightly enlarge the water outlet beneath it. If it sinks prematurely, the outlet is too large and must be adjusted to a smaller size, ensuring precise alignment with the hour.\n\nWhen the bowl is placed at the initial quarter of the *wu* hour, the Daoist assembly takes their seats. By the final quarter of *wu* approaching the initial quarter of *wei*, the bowl sinks into the water, and the five bells resound—only then may the assembly rise. This method ensures the timing remains exact, and future practitioners should follow this as their standard.\n\n**Design of the Bowl Stand**\nIn ancient times, a small chamber resembling an incense pavilion was constructed, with a *Taiji* circle suspended by a rope from the pavilion’s beam. A bell hung within the circle, and the bowl was struck beneath it. A water vat held the bowl to mark the time.\n\nI have since reformed this system, replacing it with a stand. The stand’s two ends are adorned with colored tassels, and a jeweled canopy hangs at its center. A chime with five bells is installed within, and the bowl strikes the canopy above. When the hour arrives and the bowl fills with water, it sinks, causing all five bells to ring in harmony—a design unlike any found in the secular world, first devised by me.\n\n**Quanzhen Ritual for Entering the Hall**\nWhen a Quanzhen Daoist on pilgrimage first arrives at a temple or abbey and enters the bowl hall, they are led by the Master of Ceremonies to pay respects before the ancestral master. First, three incense offerings are made. After the Master of Ceremonies recites the *Cantang* text, a nine-prostration bow is performed. The practitioner then retires from the hall to join the assembly for tea.\n\n**Cantang Text**\nIn search of kindred spirits,\nI wander lakes and seas.",

      "translated_text": "With staff and bamboo hat, half a lifetime spent in carefree wandering. Unfettered by wild waters and idle clouds, ten years of roaming now weary me. Girded with a sword that props up the heavens, I command all spirits to tremble in the void; embracing a three-foot withered paulownia zither, I strike celestial notes to summon the crisp qi of the firmament—startling gibbons and cranes in the empty mountains, subduing tigers and coaxing dragons to roar over autumn waters. Thus do I dwell beside the Great Void, befriending wind and moon, in such refined seclusion—how magnificent! Truly immortal!\n\nMoreover, with a staff I pierce through boundless green mountains, with my feet I tread across the ten directions’ clouds and waters. Though I have yet to shatter the void, I must forge mortal bones into something transcendent. If an iron pestle can be ground into a needle, how can the Golden Elixir not be achieved? Should the secret strike true and the Dao align with the subtle, what I study is no heterodox or unorthodox deviation, but the Great Way of China’s sages. This path can shatter the demonic barrier, erasing my name from the ledgers of darkness; it can ascend me to the celestial courts, inscribing my name in the Register of Gold. Awaiting the day I soar on azure skies, riding a white crane above the winds of jade; for now, I feast on yellow essence and purple mushrooms, lingering in the valleys and gorges.\n\nI have savored the cool breeze and bright moon, tasting the wonders of the Dao; I have struck golden bells and wielded jade dust-whisks, plumbing the depths of the mysterious. Across the ends of the earth I sought the lofty, yet like unyielding iron I have not met my lodestone; like needle and mustard seed, we have not yet found affinity. Thus today I come especially in search of truth.\n\nBy chance I arrive here, daring to trespass upon the ancestral master’s hall. Ashamed of my rustic manners, I humbly offer incense in sincerity, invoking: the Dao Ancestor, the Yellow Emperor; the Dao Ancestor, the Most High Lord Lao; the northern and southern lineages; and all the perfected immortals and sages of past ages. Reverently, I address the esteemed master presiding over the bowl hall, the immortal companions and perfected peers within these jade halls—whose Dao bones are already formed, whose immortal aura has long been manifest. We, mere blades of grass and motes of dust, base as mist and clouds, by the faintest thread of root-qi have been permitted to enter the supreme and wondrous gate. Granted the great honor of ascending the hall, we offer this initial rite of courtesy. For a time, we set aside our gourds and bamboo hats to follow you, discussing the Dao and expounding the mysterious in your company. From this moment of reverence, we humbly beseech your guidance.

The principal bowl-holder, the secondary bowl-holder, and the left and right duty-hall attendants together—with the entire assembly following their ranks—form two rows to stand in reverent alignment. A Dao child is then instructed to deliver the address.\n\n**Address Upon Entering the Garden:**\nWe bow in reverence, for golden lotuses offer auspicious omens, and the Seven Perfected transmit the profound words of their legacy. Cloud-script radiates its brilliance, and for ten thousand generations, all look up to the wondrous subtleties of the Recluse. The establishment of this garden serves to return to the root and restore the mandate; the seating in the alms-bowl hall serves to abandon delusion and return to truth. When the four great elements align with the seasons, one suddenly realizes the cosmos resides within; when the five bells resound, one discerns that essence and function share a single source. We humbly pray for the silent blessings of heaven and earth, for the workings of creation to aid our refined aspirations, for the mountain spirits to maintain tranquility, and for the realm to remain serene. May the ten directions be pure and flawless today, revealing the hidden and manifesting the subtle—where not even a speck of red dust can reach, and the spirit is refined to return to emptiness. The Dao precedes the Lord of Images; the body abides above the Pure Capital.\n\nNow, we Dao assembly, by the slightest merit of past good deeds, have been permitted to dwell in these renowned mountains. Ashamed that we possess no rare immortal blossoms or true elixir, we can only harbor the idle fancy of a moonlit jade pool. Yet in our eagerness to advance in cultivation, we must not yield to others; though the Dao does not exalt the individual, we must first master ourselves. The grotto-heaven lies on level ground—we watch as phoenixes and cranes are summoned in the azure world. Even our very bodies are but horses and men; we tether the monkey-mind within the garden chamber.\n\nToday, we shall silently ascend to the Celestial Court and mount the Golden Portal, observing stillness once daily to guard the Central Yellow and seal the Jade Pass.\n\nThe address concludes.\n\nThe left duty-hall attendant, holding a hand censer, escorts the principal bowl-holder to the incense table. Three offerings of incense are made before returning to position. The right duty-hall attendant, holding a hand censer, escorts the secondary bowl-holder to the incense table. Three offerings of incense are made before returning to position. Then, together with the entire assembly, all perform a nine-bow ritual facing upward.\n\nThe left duty-hall attendant leads the left row, beginning with the principal bowl-holder down to the lowest seat, settling each into their place. A single bow is made to each before withdrawing, after which one returns to their own seat. The right duty-hall attendant, also holding a hand censer, leads the right row to settle into their seats, following the same ritual—only a single bow is made, without full prostration.\n\nThe right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell three times. Once completed, the duty officer presents the seating chart, and the alms bowl is carried out the door. The cloud board is struck three times, and the placard is turned to display \"Closed Gate.\" Returning to the hall, they approach the incense table to offer three major incense offerings. Next, hand-censer incense is offered: holding the censer, they bow once before the principal bowl-holder, then proceed in order to bow once before each member of the assembly. Returning to the incense table, three incense offerings and three bows are made. The left duty-hall attendant then strikes the stillness bell three times, and the duty officer enters their seat to await the sound of the bell. The right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell five times, and the duty officer rises to open the door, striking the cloud board five times. The placard is turned to display \"Gate Opened.\"\n\n**Daily Ritual for Ascending the Hall and Settling into Seats:**\nWhenever the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, or *you* arrive, the duty officer first strikes the wooden fish six times to assemble the assembly for ascending the hall and settling into seats. Once completed, the right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell three times. The duty officer then presents the alms bowl and exits the door, turning the placard to display \"Closed Gate.\" The cloud board is struck three times. Returning to the hall, they approach the incense table to offer three incense offerings and three bows. Next, hand-censer incense is offered: holding the censer, they bow once before their own bowl-holder, then proceed in order to bow once before each seated member of the assembly—no full prostration is performed. Returning to the incense table, three incense offerings and three bows are made. The duty officer then enters their seat. The left duty-hall attendant strikes the stillness bell three times. After the bell’s resonance fades, the right duty-hall attendant strikes the bell five times, and the duty officer rises to open the door, striking the cloud board five times.

When wearing the Tongtian Robe, this crown is donned—known as the sovereign’s crown, not to be used by any but the king.\n\n**Tongtian Robe**\nA design of my own creation. The robe is of dark hue with a yellow lining, comprising an upper garment and lower skirt. On the chest, the Vermilion Bird; on the back, the Dark Warrior; on the left shoulder, the Azure Dragon; on the right shoulder, the White Tiger—representing the Four Spirits, all embroidered in gold. At the front, two sashes of dragon and tiger. The lower skirt has twelve panels, corresponding to the twelve months. The bordered hem evokes the image of cosmic boundaries.

Holding a jade tablet, he advanced and said: \"The Emperor toils in heart for all under heaven, governing the people with life-bestowing virtue—this is true power.\" Thus, he first embodied their form to create the ritual robe, which became the Daoist vestment for worshipping Heaven.\n\n**Shangqing Ritual Robe**\nA cloak of purple and azure, purple on the outside and azure within. Its width spans four feet and nine inches, corresponding to the numbers of the four seasons. Its length measures five feet and five inches, aligning with the qi of Heaven and Earth. The outer and inner layers follow one rule: the outer bears twenty-four strips, the inner fifteen, together corresponding to the thirty-nine stations of the Perfected Celestial Emperors. Only when clad in this imperial vestment may one proceed. Without it, one must not recklessly handle the sacred scriptures. This ritual robe is bestowed upon twelve jade lads; it may not be lent to others, nor defiled by impurity, lest the divine vestment be treated with irreverence.\n\n**Female Perfected’s Attire**\nA purple gauze robe, two zhang and four chi in length, with sleeves cut to fit comfortably. The sleeves are divided into sixteen strips, the body into twenty-three, totaling thirty-nine strips. Additionally, an azure gauze skirt is made, requiring fifteen chi of fabric, cut into eight panels each four feet and nine inches long. The remaining fabric forms the waistband, divided into eight panels with thirty-two strips—this is the \"flying azure skirt.\" Without this ritual robe, one may not chant the sacred scriptures of Shangqing. This vestment is bestowed upon twelve jade maidens; it may not be lent to others, nor defiled by impurity, lest the divine vestment be treated with irreverence.\n\n**Cave-Dwelling Attire**\nDesigned by Kou Qianzhi.\n\n**Robe**\nThe scriptures speak of the \"crane-wing robe, frosted and dense.\" In modern times, people loosely add a border a chi wide, its design identical to the crane cloak.\n\n**Crane Cloak**\nWorn by all Daoists, its color unrestricted. Those of profound virtue use black; ordinary Daoists dare not.\n\n**Fur Garment**\nIn high antiquity, people wore hides and pelts. Daoists often used deer fur for robes, as deer are creatures of transcendence. Later generations favored fox fur.\n\n**Padded Jacket**\nA variant name for the *nuo* robe, existing since ancient times. For those who have left the household life or dwell in mountains to cultivate the Dao—unable to escape the cycles of yin and yang or the cold and heat—such garments are essential to ward off wind and chill, and must never be lacking.\n\n**Half-Sleeves**\nA short-sleeved garment.

Particularly vital for elderly mountain-dwelling Daoist learners.\n\n**Undershirt**\nThe garment worn closest to the body must be washed and kept immaculately clean to avoid defilement.\n\n**Short Robe**\nA garment reaching only to the waist, called a short robe. For mountain dwellers and those in the wild, it facilitates climbing and traversing. Ancient cultivators of the Dao sometimes likened it to the attire for gathering magic mushrooms.\n\n**Wide Sleeves**\nThe Daoist scriptures speak of \"azure skirts and feathered sleeves, dragon-patterned phoenix robes.\" In antiquity, there were \"radiant flying-cloud sleeves.\" Today, these are called *chuòxiù*—wide sleeves with a short body, paired with a lower skirt.

Their size may vary according to individual need. For mats used outdoors, simplicity and elegance suffice.\n\n**Felt**\nFelt is not proper attire for Daoist monastics. Since sheep’s wool carries the stench of impurity, it offends the perfected sages; great caution is warranted. When entering the altar to perform Daoist rites, felt must not be worn. Such are the strict regulations of the Daoist code.\n\n**Rain Gear**\nEveryday rain gear may be chosen at one’s discretion.\n\n**Quilts**\nQuilts should be made of fine, lightweight cloth, without stitched borders or decorative trims. Plainness is prized; extravagance is shunned.\n\n**Sheets**\nSheets—outer coverings—are to be made of fine, lightweight silk, without borders or excessive width.\n\n**Pillows**\nPillows are to be crafted from wood, either plain or lacquered, and shaped as perfect squares.

Daoist practitioners should wear clogs or ceremonial shoes during worship. For casual movement, clogs allow the seven *po* souls to find repose.\n\n**Clogs**\nAll who receive the Sevenfold Precepts carry the black *qi* of the three *hun* and five spirits within their robes and headscarves, while the seven *po* and nine numinous spirits dwell beneath their clogs. Thus, advanced Daoists must never allow others to handle their clogs, nor touch their headscarves or robes—this is the reason.\n\n**Indoor Slippers**\nIndoor slippers are worn only in bathing chambers for washing the feet; they must not be worn elsewhere.\n\n**Clog Racks**\nSince dragons and tigers—divine spirits—lie beneath all clogs, at night they should be placed upon a wooden rack or peachwood stand, never carelessly set on the ground. Daoist practitioners must treat their ritual crowns, clogs, and robes with reverence, never discarding them lightly.\n\n**Clothing Fumigators**\nClothing should always be perfumed, ensuring it remains fragrant and immaculate, so that when one ascends the altar to perform rites, one’s presence harmonizes with the Dao.\n\n**Beds**\nFor sitting or reclining, beds should have four legs, each eight *chǐ* in length, forming a perfect square, and stand at least three *chǐ* high to sever earthly *qi* and malevolent influences. No carvings or embellishments are permitted. Another tradition speaks of the \"Purple Jade Couch of the Three Pristine Ones,\" a jade bed elevated three *chǐ* above the ground. This height is necessary because the noxious *qi* of the earthly corpse and the five toxins rise a *chǐ* from the ground; without such elevation, the body becomes clouded, the mind’s devotion falters, and communion with the perfected sages is obstructed.

There are many types of mats, each suited to what is available at the time—reeds, rushes, and the like—all must be clean and fresh. Whether coarse or fine, they may be used as one sees fit.\n\n**Comb Boxes**\nHair is the image of the stars and constellations. It is also called the \"dark cloud canopy\" and the \"remnant of blood.\" Some say hair is the \"jeweled forest of the Purple Palace,\" the dwelling place of the brain spirit, and thus must be combed and tended with method. Daoists therefore keep a comb box to store their combs.\n\n**Combs**\nCombs, with their widely spaced teeth, are essential tools for arranging the hair and promoting the circulation of blood. They must never be neglected for even a moment. Whether young or old, one should comb the hair from beginning to end each day—this is the way to prolong life.\n\n**Fine-Toothed Combs**\nFine-toothed combs, with their closely set teeth, are used to remove filth from the head. They should be made of boxwood, oak, or golden wattle. For those who follow the Dao, materials such as bone, horn, ivory, or tortoiseshell are unsuitable.\n\n**Tweezers**\nThe nose is the Gate of Heaven, the passage through which *qi* enters and exits. It should always be kept open to allow the free flow of *qi*, so that the spirit may flourish. Tweezers, made of copper or iron, are used to pluck the hairs from the nose.\n\n**Brushes**\nBrushes are used to remove the grease and grime from combs and fine-toothed combs. Those made of palm fiber or *Miscanthus* roots are best.\n\n**Ear Spoons**\nThe ears are the gates of the *hun* and the doors of the *po*. Keeping them clean ensures that the *hun* and *po* remain with the body. The ears are the remnant of skin, and ear spoons—made of gold, silver, copper, iron, bamboo, or ivory—are used to remove the filth from them.\n\n**Nail Clippers**\nThe gods of the celestial chariot’s guards reside at the tips of the fingernails. Nails are the remnant of sinew, and Daoists clip them on auspicious days to subdue the Three Corpses, preventing the rise of filth and evil. Thus, one must keep a nail clipper for trimming the nails.\n\n**Nail Pouches**\nThe *Shangqing* scriptures forbid the burning of nails and hair. The *Bowuzhi* states: \"The owl gathers people’s nails at night and places them in its eyes to divine the fortune of gold.\" The *Qianjin Fang* also says: \"Nails that enter the abdomen cause illness, which cannot be cured.\" According to the *Lingshu Jing*, burning nails and hair is among the ten defeats. Some say that ghosts who obtain a person’s nails and hair can bind the three *hun*, leading to nightmares and demonic possession. For these reasons, a nail pouch is indispensable.\n\n**Hair Pouches**\nThe body, hair, and skin must not be harmed. When combing, loose hair should be gathered and stored in a pouch. If there is much, it should be arranged neatly—never carelessly discarded, as this has been forbidden since ancient times. Those who cultivate the Dao must take heed.\n\n**Fine-Toothed Combs (for Ritual Use)**\nBefore ascending the altar or entering meditation, one must wash the hands and feet, arrange the hair, and then pay homage. First, a fine-toothed comb is used to smooth the hair before washing. They may be made of ivory, bamboo, or wood, as appropriate.\n\n**Soap Bean Pouches**\nThere are many methods for removing grease, but for bathing, none surpasses black soybean flour. It should be sewn into a pouch or stored in a box for washing.\n\n**Salt Boxes**\nTeeth are the remnant of bone. The mouth and teeth must be regularly cleansed so that all yang energies gather at the head, circulating through the mouth and teeth, thereby naturally connecting with the divine perfected. Moreover, salt congeals the blood, dispels wind, and strengthens the teeth. Thus, it is best to store powdered salt and use it to scrub the teeth frequently.\n\n**Towels**\nWhen combing the hair, one towel should be placed on the knees, and another used to wipe the hands and face.",

These are made of fine silk or gauze. If the material is too coarse, small creatures may slip through, inadvertently harming life.\n\n**Tripods**\nThe design of tripods need not be elaborated here, for their details are fully recorded in alchemical texts. Those who study the Dao must first master them; there is no need to repeat them here.\n\n**Cauldrons**\nIn antiquity, there were names such as *golden cauldron*, *Nine Tripods*, and *elixir cauldron*—all used by Daoists for refining elixirs.\n\n**Basins**\nDaoist immortals prefer those made of fired clay.\n\n**Jars**\nThese are the same as those used in common households, but they must be kept clean and free from meat, fish, grease, and oil.\n\n**Steamers**\nThere are names such as *golden cauldron and jade steamer* among those who cultivate immortality. The *Erya* states: \"A steamer is called a *yan*.\" It is also known simply as a *zeng*. In the capital and Luoyang, they are made of pottery—essentially basins without bottoms. In Jianghuai and the Wu-Chu regions, they are made of wood, while in Lingbiao, some are fashioned from large bamboo fungi, used for steaming medicinal substances. Such implements are indispensable in Daoist practice.\n\n**Vases**\nThe Daoist scriptures speak of *Jade Capital and Golden Vases*. In the capital and Luoyang, smaller jars are called *vases*. *Vase* is another name for *jar* or *urn*, and its use among people is especially indispensable.\n\n**Trays**\nModern trays are generally large and square, with tooth-like feet called *tooth trays*. These are stable and convenient for offerings. Large round trays with feet are also excellent. Their surfaces are often adorned with painted clouds, coiling dragons, dancing phoenixes, white cranes, and soaring luan birds.\n\n**Offering Boxes**\nIn contemporary usage, those carried in the hands are called *qing*, while those with lids that fit over one another are called *boxes*. Both serve as offering vessels before the Heavenly Worthies, and their varieties are numerous.\n\n**Pouring Bowls**\nWherever Daoist adepts or female immortals reside, they must first prepare washing basins and pouring bowls, or vessels to hold clean water. In all actions and movements, they must rinse their mouths and wash their hands. These vessels may be made of gold, silver, bronze, or pottery, according to what is available, but they must always have lids to prevent wind, dust, insects, or impurities from contaminating them. Such purity far surpasses that of ordinary vessels.\n\n**Spittoons**\nWhen ascending the altar or entering the meditation chamber, one must rinse the mouth with clean water and spit into a bowl or tray, never onto the ground. For to serve Heaven is like serving a sovereign, and to serve one’s master is like serving the divine. Before scriptures and images, one must not spit, rinse the mouth, or raise one’s voice loudly, but always conduct oneself as if in the presence of a wise ruler. If even serving one’s master demands such reverence, how much more so before scriptures and images! When ascending the altar or entering stillness, one should not perform ablutions in a hasty or unclean manner; spittoons should be kept nearby for convenience.\n\n**Feeding Trays for Sentient Beings**\nBy ancient custom, a tray or platform for sentient beings is placed before the refectory. After each meal, the food that remains is collected by an attendant and then scattered outside. This serves four purposes: first, to offer to the ancestors; second, to present to the earth spirits; third, to sever evil influences—for if this food is not offered, malevolent spirits will vie to invade, poisoning the human body; and fourth, to cultivate compassion, pitying all sentient beings and wishing that they, too, may partake of the Dharma’s flavor and be universally sated. Hence, it is called the *Feeding Tray for Sentient Beings*. Such trays have existed since the time of Zheng Siyuan, Ge Hong, and other masters. They are indispensable even today.",

When the belly is deepened and woven tightly from bamboo, with a broad base and ample depth, the larger ones are called *pángjī*. The people of Chu call them *shāojī*, essential for steaming and cooking, also known as *cuōjī*.\n\n**Brooms**: All halls and temples are swept with fine brooms; no others may be used indiscriminately.

However, for sweeping the main hall, only the finest and smoothest brooms are deemed suitable. Coarser brooms may be used for other temple spaces, but those designated for the main hall must never be employed elsewhere.\n\n**Strainers**: In modern usage, these serve as brush holders. They are also used for sifting medicinal herbs, rice, wheat, and other necessities in mountain retreats.\n\n**□** (pronounced *yù*): In ancient times, this was called *lèyù*, a bamboo vessel shaped like a spiral shell, holding two or three *dou*, used for rinsing rice.

      "translated_text": "For all offerings before the Heavenly Worthies during fasts and jiao rites, seasonal flowers and fruits are presented to express utmost devotion. The vessels used must be pure and clean—no defiled, impure, or improper implements may be placed among the ritual offerings. As the *Zhen’gao* states: \"When Daoists receive food during a fast, no unworthy person may handle it. Violation invites the punishment of corpse-infestation and spectral torment, as hungry ghosts assail the spirit.\" This is why ritual vessels are specially designated.\n\nFrom *The Jade Pivot’s Numinous Writings* and *Discerning the Dao of Immortals*:\n\nThe Southern Pole Elder asked the Ageless Master: \"Confucians dismiss the notion of immortals as absurd and fantastical, unworthy of discussion. All things under heaven and earth follow the same pattern: flourishing must yield to withering, completion to decay, life to death. How can it be claimed that immortals escape death, matching heaven and earth in longevity? Is this not delusion? To achieve the Dao and ascend in a sudden leap, entering the celestial palaces and joining the ranks of the Perfected—is this not deception? It is like grasping at wind without shadow, seizing reflections impossible to hold, pursuing what cannot exist, and treading paths that cannot be walked. Is this not futile? You are a student of immortality—you must know the truth. Defend it for me.\"\n\nThe Ageless Master replied: \"I have heard that among grasses and trees, all sprout in spring and wither in winter—yet the pine and cypress alone remain evergreen. Among birds and beasts, all are born and must die—yet the tortoise and crane alone enjoy long years. If even plants and animals exhibit such exceptions, how much more should humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings?\n\nConsider further: water is inherently cool, yet in Warm Valley, boiling springs emerge; fire is inherently hot, yet on Xiao Mound, cold flames arise. Stone is a heavy substance, yet in the Southern Sea, floating stones grow; feathers are light, yet in the Eastern Sea, Weak Waters sink them. These are the principles by which heaven and earth generate things—some defy the ordinary.\n\nAgain, pheasants transform into clams, sparrows into mussels; earthworms sprout wings, river frogs take flight; water beetles become clams, duckweed decays into maggots; field mice turn into waterfowl, rotting grass into fireflies; Niu Ai became a tiger, the woman of Chu a dragon; turtles transform into tigers, snakes into dragons; mulberry branches become willows, wheat into butterflies; maples take human form, the maiden of Qin turns to stone. These all partake of heaven and earth’s numinous marvels—beyond mortal comprehension, even sages struggle to explain. Such are the wondrous workings of heaven and earth, the principles of transformation.\n\nHow much more so for humans, who are endowed with the essence of heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, and the three luminaries? Those who attain the Dao surpass even the insentient grasses and trees!\n\nFor example, when sweetened bait is laced with medicine and placed in a fish’s mouth, then boiled in a pot, the unmedicated fish are cooked and eaten, while the medicated one swims in the pot all day as if in a river or sea. When mulberry leaves are dusted with longevity medicine and fed to silkworms, they live for years without aging. When age-arresting medicine is given to newly hatched chicks or puppies, they never grow. When white-restoring medicine is fed to a white dog, its fur turns black within a hundred days. These are the wonders of medicine—how could ordinary people obtain such formulas? This demonstrates the proven efficacy of elixirs in attaining longevity.\n\nConsider also the Yellow Emperor, who refined the Nine Cauldrons on Mount Xing. When the elixir was complete, a yellow dragon descended with flowing whiskers to receive him. The Emperor ascended with eighty-one women, and seventy-one officials clung to the dragon’s whiskers and the Emperor’s bow, rising with him. Today, among the stellar lodges, the seventeen stars of Xuanyuan remain. Gonggong’s minister, Gou Long, who had erred, attained the Dao and ascended to the Southern Pole—now, near the Well and Bow lodges, the single star of the Old Man shines. Chuanxu, minister to Tang, attained the Dao and rode the Tail and Winnowing Basket lodges to become a constellation—today, near the Tail lodge, the star of Chuanxu appears, and near the Woman lodge, the four stars of Xi Zhong. Wang Liang and Zaofu, master charioteers of Zhou, attained the Dao and became stellar ranks—Wang Liang’s five stars array near the Straddler lodge, Zaofu’s five stars near the Rooftop lodge. These are all recorded in celestial texts, visible in the night sky, as clear as the sun and moon, seen by ten thousand eyes, pointed to by ten thousand fingers. How can there be no immortals?\n\nMoreover, consider the principle of transformation: In the Xia dynasty, a woman in the palace transformed into a dragon, then back into a woman. In the Shang, a woman became a man. In the time of King Jing of Zhou, a woman became a man. During the Jianping era of Emperor Ai of Han, a man became a woman, married a husband, and bore a child. During the Jian’an era of Emperor Xian of Han, a man became a woman. These are all instances of transformation.\n\nDuring the Taihe era of Emperor Ming of Wei, a man in Taiyuan opened an ancient tomb and found a woman in the coffin, still alive at thirty. She was brought out, married, and bore a child. During the Xianning era of Emperor Wu of Jin, Yan Ji of Langye died, but a year later, his voice was heard. When the coffin was opened, he appeared alive. During the Yuankang era of Emperor Hui of Jin, a woman from Liang state was betrothed to a man who was conscripted to the frontier. After a year without his return, her family remarried her, but she died of sorrow and was buried. Years later, her husband returned, opened her tomb, and she revived. He took her as his wife. These are all instances of death followed by rebirth. If the dead can return to life, how much more can the living, who possess the marvels of creation, attain immortality? These accounts are all found in the classics, clearly verifiable.\n\nNow, consider animals: the tortoise lives a thousand years, its shell displaying five colors, with two horn-like bones rising from its forehead. It understands human speech and floats upon lotus leaves.\"",

It can perch upon trees, while those not yet a thousand years old do not alight on them. The macaque lives eight hundred years, then transforms into an ape; the ape, after five hundred years, becomes a *jue*; the *jue* lives a thousand years without dying. The toad lives three thousand years, as do the *tenghuang* and *jiguang*. The qilin lives two thousand years, while deer and hares live a thousand; when they reach five hundred, their fur turns white. Foxes and wolves live eight hundred years; at five hundred, they gain the ability to transform into humans. The rat lives three hundred years; at a hundred, it turns white and becomes adept at divining by leaning upon people, known as the *zhong*. It can foretell the fortune of the year’s end and events a thousand *li* away. The snake possesses boundless longevity, and all creatures with human faces and avian bodies live ten thousand years. These are all beasts and birds that have received the numinous *qi* of Heaven and Earth, yet they can live for thousands or tens of thousands of years without dying. How much more so for humans, the most spiritually endowed of all beings—could they not attain immortality? These accounts are all recorded in the annals, clearly verifiable. From this alone, the existence of divine transcendents is evident.\n\nThe elder said: “From ancient times until now, I have never heard such words.” Upon hearing your explanation, my doubts are dispelled.\n\n**The Rarity of Encountering the Dao**\nAs stated in the *Zhen’gao*: For a being to escape the three evil destinies and be born as a human is rare. Having been born human, to be male rather than female is rare. Being male, to possess all six senses and four limbs intact is rare. With senses and limbs complete, to be born in the Central Kingdom is rare. Born in the Central Kingdom, to encounter parents and a ruler who favor the Dao is rare. Having met a Dao-favoring ruler, to be born into a Dao-favoring family with a kind and benevolent heart is rare. With a benevolent heart awakened, to believe in the Dao and the attainment of long life is rare. Having believed in the Dao and long life, to encounter the *renchen* era of Great Peace is the rarest of all. How can one not strive with diligence?\n\n**On Karmic Conditions**\nThe *Jinbi Longhu Gujing* states: Those whose past lives originated among barbarians or were reborn from the karmic retribution of beasts cannot hear the supreme Dao. Those who in past lives did not plant good roots or accumulate meritorious deeds—even if they encounter the true Dao in this life—will find cultivation difficult and loss easy. For their karmic affinity is shallow, shifting with circumstances, and few achieve success. Those who cultivate the supreme, most wondrous Dao of the Perfected do so because of past-life merit, hidden acts of virtue, kindness to others, and rescue from hardship. Heaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits naturally assist and support them, allowing them to meet true adepts and attain realization with ease. Thus, while the Dao may be divided into the orthodox and the heterodox, encountering it is not difficult—preserving it is the true challenge.\n\nMaster Zhongli said: “It is easy for humans to seek the Dao, but difficult for the Dao to seek humans”—meaning it is not transmitted to the unworthy. Later seekers of the Dao, though devoted, must guard against the seductions of heretical teachings and heterodox paths. If the heart is not single-minded, one drifts far from the Dao. How can one not be cautious and thorough in this pursuit?\n\n**On Innate Dispositions**\nThe *Baopuzi* states: If one’s fate is governed by the Star of Life, that person will inevitably favor the Dao of transcendence. Those who favor the Dao will surely attain it. If one’s fate is governed by the Star of Death, that person will not believe in the Dao of transcendence and will not cultivate its practices. Whether one delights in goodness or not is determined by one’s endowment. To alter or deprive this is beyond even Heaven’s power—like metal and stone melted in a furnace or clay vessels shaped in a kiln: though their forms are molded by these means, the sharpness of bronze and iron or the integrity of jars and porcelain depend on what they encounter, not the furnace or kiln that shaped them.\n\n**The Dao’s Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy**\nBefore Heaven and Earth were separated, the Dao stood alongside them, giving rise to the myriad things and enduring for ten thousand ages without cease. All that humankind employs in daily life is the Dao. Thus it is said: “Heaven gives birth to the multitudes.” And again: “Only Heaven, in its hidden virtue, watches over the people.” Therefore, it establishes the true Dao. The Yellow Emperor proclaimed it, and from the eras of Yao, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu to the times of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, all rulers upheld the Dao of Heaven, rectified human relations, maintained the rites of ruler and minister, the affection of father and son, and the principles of the Three Bonds. This is the Dao of the sage-kings of the Central Kingdom—what is called the orthodox Dao. It was not exclusive to the ages of Yao, Shun, the Zhou, or Confucius. Confucius said: “To seek the obscure and practice the strange—if later generations were to transmit such things, I would not do so.” When heterodox teachings arise, the great principles are obscured—hence, they are called “heretical.”\n\n**Monk Yi’an Questions the Dao**\nIn the first year of the Xiankang era of Emperor Cheng of Jin, the monk Yi’an asked Tao Kan: “In the world, many follow Buddhism, while few follow the Dao. Why is this?” Tao Kan replied: “The qilin and phoenix do not appear easily; the *moling* and *jia* do not grow often. All things that are rare are precious, while those that are common are base. Among humans, the worthy are always few, and the foolish are always many. The Dao’s teachings lie beyond the five phases and the refining of the furnace. Those who attain it ascend in broad daylight, transcending Heaven and Earth to exist alone, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay. Thus, its teachings are profound and abstruse, difficult for the foolish to learn. It is not transmitted to the unworthy, so its followers are always few. As for your teachings, they are merely a single topic—through twenty or thirty, or even forty or fifty years of quiet meditation, one may suddenly awaken, calling it ‘shattering the mass of doubt.’ For the body of form is an illusion, and the greatest joy lies in quiescent extinction. The highest goal is to avoid rebirth in the human realm, attaining the fruit of the Arhat, known as the ‘fruit of no return.’ Though its methods are accessible even to the most foolish and lowly, anyone can practice them—thus, its followers are always many.”\n\nYi’an said: “This is truly a sound argument.” He then abandoned the monastic life to study the Dao, changing his name to Du Shoujing.",

Not only does it harm oneself, but it harms others even more severely. Thus, it is rightly called ‘the thief’s art,’ and the condemnation is most apt.\n\nYet some still practice it, willingly embracing the role of thief. Wealth gained through deceit will depart through deceit. I have seen such men squander their entire future, ending their lives in deeper ruin.\n\nWhen Immortal Ge first began his alchemical studies, he was once taught the method of ‘transmuting straw’—using reagents to refine copper until it turned not only white but also soft and pliable. Later, he observed a Daoist adept crafting drinking vessels from this metal. On the base of each, he had inscribed the words ‘unfit for pawning or sale.’ A guest asked the reason, and the adept replied: ‘This is *straw-silver*. Though my household is poor and I lack proper utensils, I use these as a temporary substitute. But I fear thieves might pawn or sell them, so I mark them to prevent others from falling into ruin.’\n\nIn his later years, the Immortal destroyed all such vessels.”",

      "translated_text": "Later practitioners of refinement must all prohibit and abolish such practices.\n\nAccording to records from the second year of Jingyou in the Song dynasty under Emperor Renzong, the monk Fuqing of Bozhou submitted a memorial: “The disciples of my monastic order have abandoned the ancestral teachings and violated the fundamental precepts of our school. All aspire to the Dao of long life and enduring vision, hoping to ascend to the celestial palaces. They transmit the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and though they retain the name of ‘sitting in meditation,’ they have lost the essence of contemplating the mind and investigating nature. Internally, they secretly adopt the Daoist methods of refining lead and mercury within the body to seek longevity; externally, they practice the arts of ‘green, yellow, and white’ alchemy, coveting wealth and profit. Examining their conduct, it is all nothing more than ‘transmuting straw,’ ‘coagulating mercury,’ and ‘condensing goods’—forging false gold and silver to deceive the world and acquire wealth. This is no different from banditry. They fear neither heavenly retribution, nor royal law, nor divine punishment. How can this be the conduct of those who have left the household life to cultivate the Way?\n\nThe practice of the elixir path is inherently the domain of Daoist adepts, as it should be. Yet Daoists, knowing the strict prohibitions and celestial statutes governing alchemical scriptures, dare not engage in such practices. Only we monks secretly pursue them, harboring malicious intent to harm the world. Many have been ruined, their families broken and fortunes lost. As the earlier Confucians said, ‘The treasured teachings of the Daoists have all been stolen by the Buddhists’—this is precisely what they meant. All such practices must be prohibited and abolished.”\n\nThe emperor then issued an edict: “If any Daoist dares to entice monks for their wealth and transmit Daoist methods, or if any monk dares to abandon the ancestral teachings, secretly practice Daoist arts, privately forge false gold and silver, engage in ‘transmuting straw,’ ‘coagulating mercury,’ or ‘condensing goods,’ they shall all be exiled to the frontier garrison of Liaoxi to defend against the Khitan.” From this point onward, the transmission of the elixir path to the unworthy ceased.\n\n**On Corpse Liberation**\nWhen a person dies, one must examine their form. If it resembles that of a living person, this is *corpse liberation*. If the feet are not discolored and the skin is unwrinkled, this is also *corpse liberation*. Essentially, if the eyes remain unspoiled and indistinguishable from those of a living person, this is *corpse liberation*. If the hair has fallen out entirely and the bones have lost their form, this too is *corpse liberation*. However, *corpse liberation in broad daylight* is the mark of a transcendent—it does not fall under the category of ordinary *corpse liberation*.\n\n**The Land of Fangzhu**\nAccording to the *True Reports*: Beyond the Eastern Sea, there is a land where the Dao of long life is cultivated, called Fangzhu. Its people regard immortality as the Way and undying as joy. The land of Fangzhu is square, each side measuring 1,300 *li*, totaling 5,200 *li* in perimeter—hence its name. Its height reaches 9,000 *zhang*. There stands the Ever-Bright Great Mountain, and the Night Moon High Mound, each encircling 400 *li*. The land is lush with grasses and trees, bearing flowers and fruits. There grows the *immortal grass*, crimson and radiant, never withering, evergreen for ten thousand years. Those who eat it do not die. There are also sweet spring waters found everywhere; drinking them also confers immortality, and all who dwell there enjoy long life.\n\nIn this land resides the Lord of the Blue Emperor, whose palace lies atop the Eastern Florescence Mountain, spanning 200 *li*. Within it dwell celestial transcendent beings, and the palaces of the highest perfected ones are built there, their halls and chambers constructed of interwoven gold, jade, and *juyao* stones. There is also the Dark Cold Mountain, where the outer officials reside, their palaces encircling 200 *li*.\n\nTo the east and west of central Fangzhu lie the lesser Fangzhu lands, each 3,000 *li* distant from the greater Fangzhu. These lesser lands are also square, each side measuring 300 *li*, with a perimeter of 1,200 *li*. Each has its own palace of the Lord of the Blue Emperor, where celestial perfected beings reside.\n\nIt is said that these lands have existed since the beginning of creation, though none know their age. The mountains produce spirit birds and spirit beasts, none of which are known by name. The greater Fangzhu lies southeast of Kuaiji, 70,000 *li* distant. To the northeast, one finds the Scalding Valley and the Land of the Fusang Tree, another 60,000 *li* beyond Fangzhu.\n\nIn the land of the western lesser Fangzhu, many follow the Buddhist path. They erect pagodas carved from gold and jade, some rising hundreds of *chi* in layered towers. The people there are exceedingly filial and do not die, a result of consuming the *immortal grass*. They all ingest the essences of the Five Stars and the radiance of the sun and moon—by day, the light of the sun, and by night, the brilliance of the moon. They study the *Returning to the Hidden* of the Xia dynasty and use it to achieve flight.\n\nIn the eastern lesser Fangzhu, rare treasures abound, wondrous and numinous. There are jade wine and golden nectar. The Lord of the Blue Emperor stores celestial treasures here, and many transcendent beings dwell in this land. They eat the *immortal grass* and drink this wine and nectar, their bodies taking on the hue of gold and jade. Often, they play the *Nine Spirit Flutes* for their own amusement. The sound of a skilled flutist carries for forty *li*. The flutes have thirty holes, the bamboo measuring two to three *chi* in length. When nine flutes play in unison, the hundred beasts dance in joy, and phoenixes gather in flocks, their cries and dances harmonizing with the flute music—this is the music of that land, vastly different from the Buddhist practices of the Western Hu.\n\nThe Western Hu’s method involves blowing great conch horns and striking great dharma drums, their music unlike that of Fangzhu, and their teachings even more so. The *Nirvana Sutra* states: “Birth and extinction are extinguished; quiescence is joy.” Thus, they regard life as illusion and death as joy. The people of Fangzhu, however, regard life as joy and death as calamity. Therefore, they speak of *Buddhist teachings* but not of *Buddhist Dao*.\n\n**From the *True Reports***\nAccording to the *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*: Beyond the Eastern Sea lies Floating Swan Mountain. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, the mountain drifted to the eastern sea of Zhejiang. Upon it dwelled over three hundred female transcendent beings, each three to four hundred years old, along with two masters, each a thousand years old. The mountain produced vermilion grass, which they wove into mats and presented to the emperor. They said that within the grass dwelled red birds, which the emperor ordered to be painted—these were revealed to be vermilion phoenixes. After ten days, the mountain floated away again.\n\nThe *barbarians* revere the Dao.",

On the base of each, he had inscribed the words ‘unfit for pawning or sale.’ A guest asked the reason, and the adept replied: ‘This is *straw-silver*. Though my household is poor and I lack proper utensils, I use these as a temporary substitute. But I fear thieves might pawn or sell them, so I mark them to prevent others from falling into ruin.’\n\nIn his later years, the Immortal destroyed all such vessels.”",

      "translated_text": "The state of Joseon, since King Wu enfeoffed Jizi there, retained the rites, music, institutions, attire, culture, medicine, shamanism, divination, and augury of the Central Kingdom. As the saying goes among the Zhou people, \"Half of the ten thousand Shang merchants crossed the Liao River\"—this refers to the five thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight Chinese who accompanied Jizi to that land. To this day, its rites, music, institutions, *Classic of Poetry*, and cultural artifacts endure, preserving much of the Central Kingdom’s legacy. It cannot be spoken of in the same breath as the *barbarian* states.\n\nAlas, the secrets of the Heavenly Dao were not transmitted to lands of foreign tongues, and thus it lacks Daoist teachings.\n\nAccording to the *Mirror of the Dao*: There was a man of Silla named Kim Gakgi, who was ashamed of his country’s coarse language and *barbarian* customs. He entered the Central Kingdom to study its speech and the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for twenty-four years. Suddenly, he encountered an extraordinary person who bestowed upon him the essential secrets of the Heavenly Heart and the Dao of ascension and transformation. Thereupon, he devoted himself to the wondrous Dao, reciting the various scriptures of Daoist transcendents without cease for nine years. The Heavenly Emperor conferred upon him a sacred mandate, and he concealed himself in Mount Zhongnan. In the eleventh year of the Dazhong era of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, on the fifteenth day of the second month, he submitted a memorial to the court, stating: \"Your servant has received a decree from the Jade Emperor to ascend as Attendant of the Yingwen Terrace. Next year, on the fifteenth day of the second month, your servant shall ascend to Heaven.\" The emperor marveled at this and dispatched a court attendant to observe. On the day of his ascension, tens of thousands of residents gathered to witness, all hearing the voices of divine beings in the sky, who declared:\n\n\"The King of Silla upholds benevolence and gentleness, never bullying the weak or seizing the lands of neighboring states. He harbors no deceit toward great nations, nor does he obstruct tribute to the Central Kingdom. He does not favor warfare or the slaughter of living beings. Kim Gakgi is a clansman of the King of Silla. By decree of the Supreme Emperor, he shall ascend in broad daylight as Attendant of the Yingwen Terrace.\"\n\nThe states of Silla, Joseon, Tamna, and Baekje, all along the eastern shores of the sea, each have kings to govern them, all under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Florescence Emperor Lord. Any powerful state that seizes their lands to make them subordinate prefectures, obstructs tribute to the Central Kingdom for its own gain, or favors warfare and the slaughter of living beings shall, after death, suffer in the Nine Dark Realms, their bodies tormented by wind and blades, condemned for ten thousand kalpas without pardon. Those who invade others’ lands shall have their descendants struck by premature misfortune, and upon death, their souls shall become dogs in those lands, passing through the executioner’s block to repay their debts for a hundred generations. Aside from the retribution exacted by the mountain and river spirits of the various states, there is no absolution. Only the people of Silla, who have rendered service to the world, may ascend to the heavenly courts.\n\nAs the words faded, suddenly the air resounded with the music of flutes and drums, and phoenixes and cranes danced in flight. Banners and canopies descended from the sky to welcome him, and he ascended to Heaven. From this, it is evident that Silla, Joseon, Baekje, and Tamna, all along the eastern shores of the sea, receive the pure and numinous *qi* of Heaven and Earth and are thus capable of cultivating the Dao—this is the proof.\n\nMaster Huangfu said: \"Along the eastern shores of the sea, the eight states of Goguryeo, Tamna, Silla, and Baekje have lands and springs connected to the geomantic veins of Penglai. Their people are all capable of cultivating the Dao, and those who study it may attain longevity and enduring vision. Alas, they have forsaken the land of the East’s vital *qi* and the fount of immortality, instead embracing the Western teachings of metal’s stern, desolate, and extinguishing *qi*, regarding death as joy and life as illusion. Due to metal overcoming wood, they have lost the true immortal Dao and cannot attain longevity or enduring vision. Only Kim Gakgi of Silla understood that the Eastern lands possess the *qi* of immortals, belonging to spring and water, the realm of Heaven and Earth’s generation, the direction from which the sun rises—all places where the Dao may be cultivated. Thus, he entered the Central Kingdom to seek a master and inquire into the Dao, and ultimately ascended in broad daylight.\"\n\nThe Azure Cloud Elder said: \"The *barbarian* states are meager in fortune, and their people, having no prior cultivation or merit, possess shallow karmic roots and cannot be born in the Central Kingdom. Thus, their languages are unintelligible, and their Dao cannot be conveyed through written or spoken words. It is transmitted only mouth to mouth, heart to heart, requiring the heart to merge with the wondrous and the Dao to harmonize. Because their languages are unintelligible, it cannot be transmitted.\"\n\n**The Uighur Teachings**\nAccording to the *Scripture of the Uighur Möngke Temür’s Teachings*, translated into Chinese as the *Heavenly Scripture of the Most High Lord Lao’s Journey to the Western Regions to Convert the Barbarians and Attain the Dao*, it states: \"The Dao of the filial son lies in loyalty and filial piety. Once one understands loyalty and filial piety, one must know whence the body comes—it is the legacy of one’s parents, forming the child’s body. Having this body, one must understand the principles of filial piety. In serving one’s lord, one must fulfill the duties of a subject, never daring to defy the Heavenly Dao. The great Dao is singular, governing the transformations of the One Origin, and is the lord of Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, stars, and the myriad things. Vast and boundless, most honored and noble, it is the limitless and unparalleled Dao, encompassing all phenomena. The myriad teachings and thousand schools all emerge from it, making it the mother of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things. As for humanity, it is born of Heaven and treads upon Heaven’s path, knowing only one Heaven. Thus, they revere Heaven as their teaching.\"\n\nA gatha says:\nThere is a thing before Heaven and Earth,\nFormless, originally quiescent and empty,\nYet it is the lord of the myriad phenomena—\nThe Heavenly Dao is naturally luminous.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that the teachings established by the Most High, even in *barbarian* lands and regions of foreign tongues, universally transform them with benevolence and instruct them in righteousness, as seen here. Thus, among the Uighur who cultivate this teaching, there are those who live for three hundred years—this is the proof. Therefore, the Uighur do not defy Heaven but uphold its teachings. Their teaching acknowledges only Heaven and no other gods. Each day at dawn and dusk, they face Heaven, calling out to it and seeking blessings. They touch it with their hands, stroke their faces, and press it to their chests, believing that Heaven bestows fortune upon them.",

      "translated_text": "The Uighur’s teaching of revering Heaven is thus. In the *Discourse on Transforming the Barbarians* composed by Emperor Lizong of the Song, it is stated:\n\nI have examined the books of the Ru and Dao traditions that the Hu people sought to destroy. The Hu deeply resent the claim that Laozi transformed the barbarians, asserting that Laozi was born in the reign of King Ding, while the Buddha was born before Laozi’s departure through the pass, during the time of King Zhao—contradicting the records in Chinese Ru texts. Yet when I consult the Ru classics, the *Comprehensive Mirror* records that during the reign of King You, the Luo River ran dry, and Laozi lamented its desiccation, all of which is documented in the historical annals. King You was the ten-generations-removed ancestor of King Ding, predating him by a full ten reigns. How, then, could Laozi’s name have appeared earlier?\n\nFurthermore, the *Biography of Laozi* compiled by Liu Xiang of the Han states that Laozi served the Shang as the Keeper of Archives for the Lord of the West. The Ru classics also record: \"Lao Peng was a worthy minister of the Shang.\" Additionally, the scriptures of the Huihui consistently document the deeds of Laozi transforming the barbarians and attaining the Dao. From this, it can be conclusively argued that Laozi was born in the Shang.\n\nAt that time, the one who received the Mandate of Heaven to rule all under Heaven was called the Heavenly King. The Zhou, by virtue of King Wen’s power, were favored by August Heaven and encompassed the Four Seas as lords of the world. Their virtue and beneficence transformed all directions, so that none failed to submit. Thus, the myriad regions came to court, all bathed in the Son of Heaven’s power, for it was the reach of his grace that brought them. Laozi, as a minister of the Zhou Heavenly King, by the transformative power of the Son of Heaven’s virtue, departed westward through Hangu Pass and spread his teachings among the Qiang and the peoples of the west. All their governance and instruction originated from the Central Kingdom. As for those who speak of cultivating and studying the Dao, the very term *Dao* was established by Laozi. Since they speak of cultivating the Dao, it is undoubtedly Laozi’s transformation—could they not be Laozi’s disciples?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* states: \"Cultivating the Dao as a teaching.\" To speak of cultivating the Dao is to cultivate Laozi’s teaching. What further doubt remains?\n\nAs for the Buddha, his birth is attested in the *Wen Xuan*, compiled by Emperor Wu of Liang and his heir, Crown Prince Zhaoming. The text states: \"The two Zhuangs of Zhou and Lu personally witnessed the omen of the night’s radiance\"—referring to the stars’ disappearance. \"The two Ming of Han and Jin together adorned the embellishments of cinnabar\"—referring to the rise of his teaching. It records that the Buddha was born in the ninth year of King Zhuang of Zhou, corresponding to the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu. His teaching first arrived during the reign of Emperor Ming of Han and flourished in the time of Emperor Ming of Jin. Thus, it is said: \"Born in the two Zhuangs, flourished in the two Mings.\" This was Emperor Wu of Liang’s decree, recorded in the Ru classics as evidence for all under Heaven and all generations—a universal judgment that cannot be altered. Is this not the will of Heaven at work? Thus, the traces of China’s sages’ births and the matter of transforming the barbarians are aspects of the Heavenly Dao that cannot be erased!\n\nAlas, how arduous! Now, upon examining the teachings of Daoism and Buddhism, the origins of the *Scripture on Laozi’s Transformation of the Barbarians* began with Wang Fu. Initially ordained as a monk, his unparalleled intelligence aroused the envy of his fellow clerics, who attempted to poison him, but he survived. He then let his hair grow, donned the yellow cap, and rose to the rank of libationer. Due to his enmity with the Buddhist clergy, he altered the ancient version of the *Transformation of the Barbarians Scripture*, adding spurious claims. They mutually suppressed one another, shifting Laozi’s birth to the reign of King Ding and the Buddha’s birth to the time of King Zhao, placing it before Laozi’s western transformation and departure through the pass. From this, the origins of the *Scripture*’s fabrication were not of recent making.\n\nI contend that the matter of transforming the barbarians cannot be taken on faith. The books of the Daoist and Buddhist traditions must be verified against the Ru classics to discern who established the teachings and who was transformed by whom. The evidence is found in the *Comprehensive Geography: Barbarian Regions*, the *Wei略: Western Rong Chronicles*, the *Sui History: Western Regions Annals*, Pei Kai’s *Memorial to Emperor Huan of Han* and his annotated *Records of the Two States*, Cui Yuanshan’s *Lai Xiang Ji*, the biographies of Huangfu Mi and Ji Kang, Fan Ye’s *Book of Later Han*, Song Yun’s *Southern Yunnan Travelogue*, the *Veritable Records of Emperor Taizong of Tang*, the *Memorial of the Eight Scholars*, the eulogies of successive emperors, the prefaces of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Emperor Guangzong of Song—all of which are recorded in the Ru texts and corroborated by the Huihui scripture *Musa’lima*. The truth or falsity of these matters shines as brightly as the sun and stars; they cannot be concealed. This is the universal judgment of all under Heaven and all generations—clear as day.",

      "translated_text": "Alas, what more need I say? Comparing the teachings of the Buddha, they guide with compassion and love; the teachings of the Yellow Emperor, they guide with benevolence and righteousness; the teachings of Laozi, they guide with Dao and virtue, and expound loyalty and filial piety; the teachings of Confucius, they guide with ritual and music, and expound the fundamental norms. The essence of these three teachings in civilizing the world lies in nothing more than a single goodness—how can they be so envious of one another’s arts as to attack each other? Though the Yi and Xia differ, and customs vary, their pursuit of goodness is one and the same.\n\nBefore the Han dynasty, China knew only the two teachings of Ru and Dao. The Ru scholars even regarded Yang Zhu and Mo Di as heterodox and attacked them. By the Song dynasty, they also deemed the teachings of the Luo and Lian schools as \"false learning,\" for each established its own sect and did not follow the path of the former kings. Indeed, the sagely teachings must contain profound principles. Even among the disciples of Confucius, it was said that principles were not fully fathomed and knowledge was not exhausted—if even the sages were thus, how can mediocre scholars presume to comprehend? How can they envy others’ strengths, slander the Heavenly Emperor, disparage Confucius and Laozi, and harbor resentment? This is nothing but a path to chaos—is it not so?\n\n**Wu Cheng, Academician of the Yuan, Remonstrates Against Praying for Blessings in the Netherworld**\nAccording to the *Collected Works of Wu Caolu*, in brief: In the third year of Zhizhi of Emperor Yingzong, the transcription of the golden-script Buddhist sutras was completed. The emperor then commanded the Left Chancellor of the Secretariat, Susu, to issue an edict ordering Academician Wu Cheng to compose a preface for the sutras. The imperial decree stated: \"The transcription of the sutras is dedicated to three purposes: praying for blessings for the departed sagely emperors, seeking eternal mandate from Heaven for the ruler, and praying for the welfare of the people. A preface shall be written for these three matters.\"\n\nWu Cheng replied: \"Your Majesty’s intent in transcribing the sutras—for the state and the people—is a most noble act. However, as for praying for blessings in the netherworld, I remain ignorant of its efficacy. The Buddhist doctrine of cause and effect has never been misleading since ancient times, yet the foolish among the people delight in hearing it. Since the founding of this dynasty, how many times have sutras been transcribed for such prayers! If the deliverance proves ineffective, then the principle is nonexistent; if it proves effective, then it slanders one’s ancestors. To compose such words would be unworthy of posterity.\"\n\nThe Left Chancellor said: \"This is the emperor’s command. Sir, please await His Majesty’s return and present your case personally.\"\n\nWhen Emperor Yingzong arrived, Liulin was the Censor-in-Chief. Tie Shi assassinated the emperor in his traveling tent. Upon ascending the throne, Wu Cheng wept before the new emperor, saying: \"Praying for blessings led to swift self-destruction, dying at the hands of treacherous ministers—this was the fate of Emperor Wu of Liang and Emperor Xiang of Qi. The futility is evident. To pray for the deliverance of ancestors is to wish them rebirth in the Western Rong lands rather than in the Central Kingdom—truly a laughingstock for all generations.\" The emperor then commanded Daoist priests to perform the *Qishou* ritual for longevity, declaring: \"I, having inherited the accumulated virtue of my ancestors and the celestial mandate, have received the bright decree of Heaven to rule as lord of the Central Kingdom and possess the Four Seas. I wish to ascend with the people into the realm of longevity, sparing them from the calamity of premature death, and fulfilling the virtue of Heaven’s completion. The Lord on High cherishes life—may this prayer be granted.\"\n\nHe also established the *Jianzu* ritual for ancestral deliverance, declaring: \"I have heard that the human form is hard to obtain, and birth in the Central Kingdom is rare. My ancestors were born in the northern deserts and received the mandate of Heaven. I was born in the Central Kingdom. Former sages all prayed for their ancestors’ rebirth in the Western Rong lands, but now, through my prayers, I wish the spirits of the Nine Temples to ascend to the celestial gates, not to be reborn in the Western Rong.\" Thereupon, he ordered that in every province, on festival days and the emperor’s birthday, Daoist priests should pray to Heaven to seek longevity for the Son of Heaven, blessings for the people, and the ascension of ancestors to Heaven. The rituals of *Jianba* (deliverance) and *Xishou* (prayer for longevity) were entrusted to Daoist recorder Hao Chongxiao for revision, and the new rites were disseminated throughout the land. Henceforth, all state rituals were to follow this principle.\n\n**Oral Instructions on Cultivating Immortality**\nWhen consuming medicinal substances, avoid garlic, pomegranate seeds, pig’s liver, and dog’s head meat. Complete abstention is the highest path for Daoist priests. One must not consume pork or dog meat while engaging in bedroom arts, for this nullifies the efficacy of the medicine. Each pound consumed diminishes one’s lifespan by a hundred days—beware! (Recorded by a disciple of Peng Zu.)\n\nWhen taking divine medicines, never face north—this is a great taboo. On *hai* and *zi* days, do not spit, lest one lose essence and qi, shortening one’s lifespan and rendering the medicine’s potency as dust. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\nDaoist priests seeking immortality must not consort with women. A single encounter drains a year’s medicinal efficacy. Even without consuming medicine, engaging in bedroom arts reduces one’s lifespan by thirty years. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\n**Oral Instructions of the Green Youth Lord**\nDaoist cultivators consuming food must avoid bloody substances. Eating them prevents the expulsion of the Three Corpses; only dried meat is permissible. (See Ge Hong’s *Inner Chapters*.)\n\n**Methods for Daoist Cultivators**\nWhen ill, close your eyes and inwardly visualize, using the fire of the heart to burn the body. Preserve the entire body, making the essence as if tangible—the illness will be cured. If pain persists, direct the fire to that spot, and it will surely take effect. (From *Accounts of Divine Immortals*.)\n\nThose cultivating the Dao and seeking immortality must not look upon corpses, for it severely harms the spirit and disrupts qi. Only rulers, teachers, and beloved parents may be attended in death out of necessity. Thus, when Daoist priests pass away, they do not serve kings or nobles—this would be lacking in loyalty. To remain solitary and aloof is to lack companionship. Only for parents, teachers, and masters must one attend their funerals, enduring the utmost grief and risking harm to one’s life. If one is harmed by such sorrow, it is as if one had never been harmed at all. I keep this secret and transmit it orally.",

By the era of Tang Yao, the eight roamed Mount Zhongnan, where people saw them and, because it was the age of Tang Yao, called them the Tang Eight Immortals. Later generations mistakenly applied the name to the Eight Immortals of the Tang Li dynasty, such as Lü Dongbin.\n\nHuainan Eight Masters:\nSu Fei, Li Shang, Zuo Wu, Tian You, Jin Chang (two names missing, their identities lost; later people erroneously substituted two others).\n\nPrince An of Huainan, grandson of Emperor Gaozu and son of Prince Chang of Huainan, was fond of Confucian learning, esoteric arts, and the methods of divine transcendence and flying ascent. He composed the *Inner Book of Huainan* in twenty scrolls, the *Book of Vast Treasures and Myriad Years* in three scrolls, and the *Fire Lotus Sutra* in five scrolls, expounding the principles of Heaven’s Dao and the transformations of creation, thereby attaining the Way of long life and enduring vision. Each year, he refined three hundred *yi* of yellow gold, offering it to the imperial court to replace half the people’s land taxes. The emperor commanded Liu Xiang to seek his method, but after five summons, the prince refused to come. Enraged, the emperor harbored hostile intentions. The prince, unable to resist, entrusted Liu Xiang with the cinnabar script, which Liu tied to his elbow. That night, he knocked at the palace gate, believing the elixir could be completed. After several years, the elixir failed, wasting vast sums, for he had not received the oral transmission—it was but empty words on paper. The emperor, furious, sought to punish him. The prince’s ministers, Lei Bei and Wu Bei, whom he had long favored, were sparring with the crown prince with swords when Lei Bei accidentally wounded the prince’s left thigh. Enraged, the prince refused Lei Bei’s request to join the campaign against the Xiongnu to atone for his crime and sought to execute him. Fearing death, Lei Bei reported the prince’s treason to the emperor. Out of familial affection, the emperor hesitated to punish him, merely stripping him of two counties. Wu Bei, meanwhile, had committed private misdeeds and incurred the prince’s wrath, though no action was taken. Wu Bei, fearing execution, corroborated Lei Bei’s earlier accusation of treason. The廷尉 tortured the prince’s ministers until they confessed, fabricating a confession that the treason was real. Sima Qian included this in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Hereditary House of Huainan*, suppressing the fantastical tales of divine transcendence and flying ascent. The emperor then dispatched the宗正 with the imperial staff to punish the prince. The Eight Masters arrived and said to the prince: “The harm caused by Lei Bei and Wu Bei is truly Heaven’s way of urging you on. Now that your Dao is accomplished, you cannot remain long among men, lest you be slandered by ministers. As a subject who deceives his lord and father, Heaven’s law demands your life.” Thereupon, they prepared a wooden effigy, feigning execution. They suspended the prince’s cap and robes from a beam with a wooden pestle, then ascended a mountain with him to perform a great sacrifice. They buried gold in the earth, and the entire household ascended to Heaven in broad daylight. When the宗正 arrived, he saw the prince’s corpse hanging in the courtyard. Suddenly, a report came: “He is not truly dead.” The prince and his family had fled to the mountains of Huainan, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. The宗正 pursued to the spot but heard only orioles singing in the sky and dogs barking among the clouds. He returned to report to the court. The emperor, filled with regret, executed Lei Bei and Wu Bei, fulfilling the Eight Masters’ words. The *Records of the Grand Historian* records that the prince committed suicide, concealing the tale of his ascension lest later rulers, enamored of the methods of divine transcendence and flying ascent, abandon their sacred duties. Lei Bei and Wu Bei were the prince’s ministers, the true criminals who slandered him. Later generations, unaware of the Eight Masters’ names, mistakenly included the two traitors among them.

Pepper is the essence of the Jade Balance Star; consuming it makes the body light and fleet of foot, prolonging life and enhancing longevity.

Yin Xi welcomed him to his home and first offered *ming*, marking the origin of tea. Laozi said: \"Those who consume this tea are all disciples of your Dao.\" Later, it became customary that whenever guests arrived at a household, tea was served first—this was its beginning. *Ming* is tea. Its names are: first *tu* (tea), second *jia*, third *she*, fourth *ming*, and fifth *chuan*.\n\n**Tofu**—The Prince of Huainan attained the Dao of soaring transformation, refining the five metals into treasures and transmuting the eight minerals into water. Having mastered the principles of plant alchemy, he created tofu. At that time, a *dou* of beans in Chang’an was worth a thousand coins. Today, those who observe vegetarian fasts all use it. A poem says: \"The whole household learned the arts of Huainan’s guard.\" The consumption of tofu by later generations began with the Prince of Huainan.\n\n**Tortoise-Peach**—The Yellow Emperor offered *mian* as tortoise-peach in his sacrifices to Heaven, symbolizing the offerings of immortals. Thereafter, all who performed vegetarian rites and jiao ceremonies used it, beginning with the Yellow Emperor.\n\n**Birthday Celebrations and Poison-Averting**—Qian Keng presented incense and a pheasant stew on Yao’s birthday, along with a handkerchief, to celebrate Yao’s longevity. Yao enfeoffed Keng as Lord of Pengcheng. The custom of exchanging handkerchiefs to celebrate birthdays began with this.
