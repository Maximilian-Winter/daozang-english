  "full_translation": "**Hymn of Illuminating the True and Dispelling the False**\n\n*Title:* *Hymn of Illuminating the True and Dispelling the False*\n*Author:* Zhang Yuanjun of Xuqing, attributed to Zhang Jixian of the Northern Song\n*One fascicle. Source text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* Section, Hymns and Eulogies.\n\n---\n\n**The Dao Gives Birth to Heaven and Earth**\nBefore the primordial chaos divided, the Dao already was—\nFormless and colorless, without emotion or intent.\nNaturally nurturing, it brought forth heaven and earth:\nThe Way of Heaven, light and clear; the Way of Earth, serene and still.\n\n**Heaven and Earth Give Birth to Man**\nThe Dao begot heaven and earth when names were yet unspoken,\nParting yin and yang to establish the Five Phases.\nMan stands amidst them, most numinous of the ten thousand things,\nBorn of heaven and earth, shaped by the Dao.\n\n**Man Receives Yin and Yang**\nOf the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Man—all share the same primordial darkness.\nMan is endowed with the numinous radiance of precelestial unity.\nThis darkness, embodied, is called the Dao by day,\nResonating with heaven, earth, and the divine spirits.\n\n**The One Gives Birth to the Three**\nBeyond the One True, no truth exists;\nThe ancestral darkness, spiritually attuned, pervades this body.\nThe Dao, undivided, generates the Three in wondrous function:\nOriginal essence, original qi, and original spirit.\n\n**The Three Treasures of the Human Body**\nOriginal essence, original qi, and original spirit—\nThe Three, formless yet manifest in form.\nWhen their operation is mastered and transmitted, the True becomes visible,\nRadiant and boundless, perfectly clear.\n\n**The One Without Form Interconnects**\nThunder arises from the transformation of precelestial darkness;\nAll the immortals and sages of the heavens share this same truth.\nThe singular darkness within my body summons and responds,\nOf one ancestry, one lineage, intimately bound as bone and flesh.\n\n**Uniting Mind with Spirit**\nWhere the true mind stirs, there lies the mechanism of thunder.\nSpirit merges with spirit—how wondrous and strange!\nHere alone is no distinction,\nLike a magnet drawing iron, never apart.\n\n**The Dharma Is the Mind Itself**\nBeyond this mind, no dharma exists;\nIncantations, talismans, and diagrams seldom align with truth.\nWhen the mind is true, what wondrous function can it not perform?\nA single point of numinous radiance directs the original spirit.\n\n**The Spirit Can Reach Heaven**\nThe original spirit presents a sealed missive,\nA beam of cold light piercing the great void.\nIt travels directly to the Jade Capital and Golden Gates,\nWhere celestial grace descends like a shooting star upon the heavenly thoroughfare.\n\n**Rebuking Heaven with a Shout**\nShouting into the void, issuing commands with a roar—\nWho recognizes the original spirit as the summoned messenger?\nHeaven is high, the stars distant—how could they hear?\nLet them be, with their \"this\" and \"that,\" their \"and\" and \"also.\"\n\n**Summoning Thunder with Golden Light**\nGolden light blazes, illuminating the Thunder Citadel;\nA million thunder soldiers obey the command.\nNo talismans, no incantations, no mudras are needed—\nIn drought, it brings rain; in rain, it brings clear skies.\n\n**Deluded Practices**\nFailing to grasp the mechanism of yin and yang’s opening and closing,\nAll imagined techniques and applications are but folly.\nA thousand thousand thunder talismans burned to ash—\nYet not a single drop of rain has ever fallen.\n\n**True Thought Subdues Demons**\nWhere lies the work of subduing demons?\nWithin, the original spirit abides in stillness and stability.\nWhen the sword of wisdom is brandished, gods and ghosts bow;\nThus, calamities and harms vanish of themselves.\n\n**Deluded Minds Invite Ghostly Deception**\nDeluded thoughts swirl, losing all truth;\nTalismans, diagrams, and incantations waste the spirit.\nGhosts and spirits, seeing this, laugh in mockery,\nHurling stones and bricks to harm instead.\n\n**The Ancestral Darkness Is the Sun’s Essence**\nThe precelestial ancestral darkness is the sun’s purest essence,\nRefining yin souls to a single numinous nature.\nThe Ninefold Mysterious Work is accomplished in an instant,\nAs yin and yang unite to conceive the embryonic immortal.\n\n**Discerning True Yin and Yang**\nFailing to recognize true yin and true yang,\nOne might as well bathe in water or scorch with fire.\nIf the single point of numinous radiance remains unclear,\nWhat benefit is there in delivering lost souls?\n\n**Nanchang Is Not the Mind**\nThe Mysterious Pass, a single aperture, holds yin and yang;\nHeart and kidneys are not the domains of water and fire.\nI urge refining masters to lift their gaze—\nDo not mistake the mind’s palace for Nanchang.\n\n**The Dharma of Universal Salvation**\nThe work of universal salvation differs still:\nGolden light blazes, illuminating the nether realms.\nA single grain of millet pearl hangs suspended in emptiness,\nAs the Supreme Ultimate returns to the Ultimateless.\n\n**Seeking What Cannot Be Sought**\nIgnorant of the master of one’s own original qi,\nOne vainly seeks heaven’s response in empty space.\nIt is like riding an ox in search of the ox—\nWhat is there to say to such people?\n\n**Failing to Recognize the Original Spirit**\nSummoning generals begins with a thunderous command,\nThe command’s roar awakens my original spirit.\nWhy then do they not see the original spirit’s face?\nOnly because people of this age have forgotten their true nature.\n\n**The Seal Must Be the Mind’s Seal**\nThe mind-seal is transmitted with cause and reason;\nToday’s people stamp with wood, unaware of the mystery.\nWhere the mind-seals of the patriarchs align,\nEach radiates brilliance, piercing the nine heavens.\n\n**A Single Point of Numinous Radiance**\nThe subtlety of talismanic arts begins with effort,\nGathering at the tip of the brush to inscribe the talisman.\nClinging to form, imagining, performing mudras—\nAll that remains is ink and cinnabar.\n\n**The Precelestial Script**\nThe head of the talisman’s inscription must be in celestial seal-script,\nOriginally written by the Sovereign Lord with his brush.\nThe characters of Cangjie, of the postcelestial world,\nAre but delusions, bewildering the foolish.\n\n**Deluded Yin and Yang**\nSwallowing and spewing yin and yang within talismanic practice,\nHeart and kidneys wax and wane in darkness and redness.\nA single qian and kun encompass such vastness—\nHow can these petty tricks ever succeed?\n\n**The Single Point Between the Kidneys**\nBetween the two kidneys, a single point of brightness—\nFools guard it, seeking spiritual communion.\nWho knows this place is all yin qi?\nThe true yang’s radiance lies ten thousand leagues away.\n\n**The Original Spirit Below the Heart**\nSome say below the heart lies an empty chamber,\nWhere essence, qi, and original spirit gather.\nHow easily fools are deceived—\nThey do not recognize the true master.\n\n**The Gallbladder Is Not the Thunder Palace**\nMistaking the viscera for the Thunder Palace,\nAnger swells, stirring shock and awe.\nOnce the crystal vase is shattered,\nWhen has thunder’s roar ever been heard?\n\n**Pointing to Thunder**\nWhere the single yang arises, the earth’s thunder revives—\nThe external kidneys are not thunder’s dwelling.\nFoul and turbid, even sages find repentance difficult;\nSuch acts will surely incur thunder’s judgment.\n\n**Failing to Distinguish True Yang**\nHeart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, gallbladder—\nWith *xu*, *he*, *yan*, *xi*, *hu*, and *chui*, one draws them in.\nThese are the yin and yang qi of parents’ postcelestial bodies—\nHow can they be used to pray for clear skies or rain?\n\n**Seven Things Purely Yin**\nTears, saliva, fluids, essence, qi, blood, and humor—\nAll seven are yin, utterly without benefit.\nWithin the body, only one yin and one yang exist—\nYet how many in the rivers and lakes fail to recognize this?\n\n**Foul Qi Offends the True**\nSome speak of the three-tenths of an inch below the navel,\nWhere golden light is said to reside in practice.\nWho knows this place is filled with yin’s turbid qi?\nWhen activated, its filth is unbearable to hear.\n\n**Seeming Yet Not So**\nFalsely claiming a single aperture lies between the brows,\nPenetrating three-tenths of an inch deep—how absurd!\nMisleading the world’s people is truly laughable,\nLike mistaking a brick for gold.\n\n**Mistaking the Postcelestial**\nThe navel wheel and kidneys connect behind—\nBoth hollow, both entirely postcelestial.\nIf one asks where the wondrous precosmic lies,\nOnly meeting a perfected master can convey.\n\n**Thunder Strikes Unceasing**\nThunder’s use, thunder’s might—how fierce its wrath!\nYet some wait for stars to halt, the sun and moon to pause.\nIf such celestial secrets were so easily divined,\nWhy invoke the arts to pray for rain or shine?\n\n**The Deviant Bewilders the True**\nHow many lack the Dao-eye’s clarity,\nCommanding pine spirits to manifest at will?\nOnly because the body lacks a sovereign lord\nDo yin souls falsely borrow names to feign their power.\n\n**Discerning the Essential**\nOne divine general serves a hundred schools—\nMost are fabrications of their founders’ hands.\nAfter years pass, much proves false:\nCan incantations and talismanic water truly work?\n\n**Dual Mastery in Practice**\nDaoist arts cling to incantations and talismans,\nYet both must be upheld by the Dao’s subtlety.\nWhen precosmic mystery’s work is complete,\nIncantations and talismans may fade to naught.\n\n**Dao as the Foundation of Method**\nPracticing the Great Dao aligns with the precosmic;\nIncantations, talismans—all are but mystery.\nWhen the Supreme Dao vanishes into the ineffable,\nTalismans and incantations are but empty forms.\n\n**The Myriad Methods Return to One**\nThe Dao arises from the One—what doubt remains?\nIt may be wuwei or youwei as needed.\nAll methods inherently return to this single source—\nWhy distinguish between Orthodox Unity and Pure Subtlety?\n\n**Creation Lies Within Me**\nThough forms differ, their essence is not black nor white;\nOne must labor where kinship is closest.\nThe human body, in essence, mirrors heaven and earth—\nYin and yang’s transformations all belong to me.\n\n**Sitting in Stolid Emptiness**\nMindless, stolidly sitting for years,\nOne fancies immortality already attained.\nYet without grasping the dragon’s hum or tiger’s roar,\nSuch empty sitting is but futile.\n\n**Yin and Yang Interdepend**\nWithin a hollow stone lies hidden white jade;\nThough its light may dazzle the eye,\nThe Great Yin fundamentally receives the Great Yang’s essence—\nFrom the waxing crescent on the eighth to fullness on the sixteenth.\n\n**Methods Breed Slander**\nMeant to guide fellow disciples from delusion,\nThe superior root grasps the subtle at a glance.\nYet if this is taught to the foolish and blind,\nSlander and wrath arise—all is discord.\n\n**The Ode on Illuminating Truth and Dispelling Delusion Concludes**",
