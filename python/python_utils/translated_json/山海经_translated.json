  "full_translation": "**The Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n\n**Title:** *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* (*Shanhai Jing*). Eighteen scrolls. Base text sourced from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Benwen* category. Collated with: Hao Yixing’s *Annotations and Commentaries on the Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Dong Ke’s *Collated and Translated Classic of Mountains and Seas*, and Tan Chenggeng’s *Punctuated and Collated Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\n**Preface to the Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n\nThose who peruse the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* invariably regard its vast and fantastical claims—its abundance of strange and wondrous, extraordinary and marvelous accounts—with skepticism. I have ventured to discuss this, saying: As Zhuangzi once observed, \"What humans know is nothing compared to what they do not know.\" This truth is manifest in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nConsider the boundless expanse of the cosmos, the teeming multitude of living beings, the interplay of yin and yang, the myriad distinctions among the ten thousand things—where qi intermingles in chaos, pressing and blending into one another, where wandering spirits and numinous anomalies take form upon encountering images, shaping themselves into mountains and rivers, adorning themselves upon trees and stones—how could such wonders ever be fully recounted?\n\nThus, all that seems discordant converges into a single resonance; all that appears chaotic coalesces into a single image. The world deems certain things \"strange,\" yet knows not why they are strange; it deems others \"not strange,\" yet knows not why they are not. Why is this so? Things do not inherently possess strangeness; they become strange only in relation to us. The strangeness, then, lies within us, not within the things themselves.\n\nThus, the Hu people, upon seeing cloth, mistake it for felt; the Yue people, upon seeing fine wool, are startled by its softness. Familiarity breeds complacency toward the commonplace, while rarity evokes wonder at the unfamiliar—this is the perennial blindness of human nature.\n\nLet me offer a few examples to illustrate: fire emerges from ice and water, while yin-aligned mice are born in scorching mountains. Those who discuss such matters find nothing strange in them, yet when they encounter the accounts in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, they deem them bizarre. This is to ignore what should be deemed strange and to marvel at what should not. To ignore what should be strange is to verge on seeing nothing as strange at all; to marvel at what should not be strange is to have never truly encountered the marvelous.\n\nIf one can discern what should not be so and what cannot be otherwise, then principle itself admits of no exceptions.\n\nExamining the *Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery* and the *Biography of King Mu*: King Mu, on his western expedition, met the Queen Mother of the West, who presented him with jade and silk as tokens of goodwill, along with brocades and woven ornaments. King Mu feasted with the Queen Mother upon the Jade Pond, exchanging poems of refined elegance. He then ascended Kunlun’s peaks, toured the Palace of the Yellow Emperor, gazed upon the ridges of Mount Zhong, and beheld the treasures of the divine rulers. He carved an inscription upon the Queen Mother’s mountain and left his mark upon the gardens of the Dark Grove. He gathered rare woods, resplendent herbs, exotic birds, and strange beasts, along with jade, precious stones, vessels of luminous beauty, golden unguents, and silver that shone like torches, bringing them back to cultivate and rear within the Central Kingdom.\n\nKing Mu rode a chariot drawn by eight steeds, with Daoli on the right and Lu’er on the left. Zaofu served as his charioteer, and Benrong as his attendant on the right. They traversed tens of thousands of miles, journeying through the renowned mountains and great rivers of the four directions, scaling and crossing them all. To the east, he ascended the halls of the Giants; to the west, he feasted in the abode of the Queen Mother; to the south, he crossed the bridge of giant turtles and alligators; to the north, he trod the thoroughfare of accumulated feathers. Only after exhausting all pleasures and delights did he return.\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, King Mu obtained the steeds Daoli, Lu’er, and Hualiu, and had Zaofu drive them on his western tour, where he met the Queen Mother of the West and reveled so joyously that he forgot to return. This account aligns with the *Bamboo Annals*.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: \"King Mu wished to indulge his desires, seeking to leave his chariot tracks and horse hoofprints across the world.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records precisely this.\n\nYet scholars like Qiao Zhou, though erudite and refined, dismissed these verified historical accounts as fabrications. Sima Qian, in his \"Account of Dayuan,\" also remarked: \"Since Zhang Qian’s mission to Daxia and his exploration of the Yellow River’s source, who has truly beheld the fabled Kunlun?\" As for the strange creatures recorded in the *Basic Annals* and the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, I dare not speak of them—is this not lamentable?\n\nHad the *Bamboo Annals* not resurfaced after a thousand years to serve as evidence today, the words of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* would have nearly been discarded. Consider further: Dongfang Shuo knew the name of the *Bifang* bird; Liu Xin distinguished the corpse of the *Daoxie*; Wang Qi sought the two-faced visitor; and the people of the distant seas obtained the garment of the long-armed being. These are precise verifications, rare confirmations spanning ages.\n\nAlas! Might those who remain deluded awaken, even slightly?\n\nThus, the sagely emperors traced transformations to their utmost variations, embodying things to respond to anomalies, perceiving without obstruction, and exhaustively exploring the hidden and subtle. How profound! How mysterious!\n\nThis book spans seven dynasties and three thousand years. Though it briefly flourished during the Han, it soon fell into obscurity. The names and locations of its mountains and rivers often contain errors, differing from present-day records. With no transmitted teachings from masters, it nearly vanished. That which the Dao preserves, the world abandons—how tragic!\n\nI fear this loss, and so I have undertaken to transmit it anew, clearing its obstructions, dispelling its overgrowth, elucidating its profound subtleties, and marking its depths and shallows. May this ensure that its neglected texts do not perish from the world, its wondrous words do not fade from the present, the traces of the Xia sovereigns are not erased in times to come, and the affairs of the eight wilds remain known to future generations. Would this not be worthwhile?\n\nThe flight of a mayfly cannot compare to the soaring of a celestial roc; the swimming of minnows in a puddle cannot fathom the ascent of a crimson dragon. The courts of heaven’s music are not trodden by mere musicians; the fordless abyss is not crossed by the rhinoceros or the buffalo. Without the utmost penetration of the world, one cannot discourse on the meaning of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nAlas! May those of broad vision and vast learning take heed.\n\n**Catalogue of the Classic of Mountains and Seas**\nEighteen scrolls in total.\nMain text: 30,919 characters.\nAnnotations: 20,350 characters.\nTotal: 51,269 characters.\n\n**The Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n**Catalogue of Scrolls**\n\n**Scroll 1: Southern Mountains**\nMain text: 3,547 characters\nAnnotations: 2,107 characters\n\n**Scroll 2: Western Mountains**\nMain text: 5,672 characters\nAnnotations: 3,202 characters\n\n**Scroll 3: Northern Mountains**\nMain text: 5,746 characters\nAnnotations: 2,382 characters\n\n**Scroll 4: Eastern Mountains**\nMain text: 2,040 characters\nAnnotations: 375 characters\n\n**Scroll 5: Central Mountains**\nMain text: 4,718 characters\nAnnotations: 3,485 characters\n\n**Scroll 6: Beyond the Southern Seas**\nMain text: 511 characters\nAnnotations: 622 characters\n\n**Scroll 7: Beyond the Western Seas**\nMain text: 537 characters\nAnnotations: 452 characters\n\n**Scroll 8: Beyond the Northern Seas**\nMain text: 584 characters\nAnnotations: 493 characters\n\n**Scroll 9: Beyond the Eastern Seas**\nMain text: 442 characters\nAnnotations: 595 characters\n\n**Scroll 10: Within the Southern Seas**\nMain text: 364 characters\nAnnotations: 709 characters\n\n**Scroll 11: Within the Western Seas**\nMain text: 439 characters\nAnnotations: 695 characters\n\n**Scroll 12: Within the Northern Seas**\nMain text: 594 characters\nAnnotations: 495 characters\n\n**Scroll 13: Within the Eastern Seas**\nMain text: 624 characters\nAnnotations: 1,495 characters\n\n**Scroll 14: The Great Wilderness: East**\nMain text: 864 characters\nAnnotations: 813 characters\n\n**Scroll 15: The Great Wilderness: South**\nMain text: 972 characters\nAnnotations: 598 characters\n\n**Scroll 16: The Great Wilderness: West**\nMain text: 1,282 characters\nAnnotations: 1,203 characters\n\n**Scroll 17: The Great Wilderness: North**\nMain text: 1,056 characters\nAnnotations: 767 characters\n\n**Scroll 18: Within the Seas**\nMain text: 1,111 characters\nAnnotations: 967 characters\n\nThe main texts of *Within the Seas* and *The Great Wilderness* were originally appended externally.\n\nThe Attending Secretary, Chariot and Cavalry Commandant, and Palace Attendant, the Illustrious Grand Master, your servant Xiu, oversaw the collation of the secret archives and states: The *Classic of Mountains and Seas* collated by Minister Wang of the Secretariat and Chamberlain for Ceremonials originally comprised thirty-two scrolls, now consolidated into eighteen.\n\nThe established *Classic of Mountains and Seas* emerged during the era of Yao and Shun. In former times, the vast floods overflowed, inundating the Central Kingdom. The people lost their footholds, clambering upon hills and nesting in trees. When Gun’s efforts proved futile, Emperor Yao commanded Yu to succeed him. Yu rode the four conveyances, following the mountains to fell trees, determining the heights of mountains and the courses of great rivers. Together with Boyi, he drove forth the birds and beasts, named the mountains and rivers, classified the grasses and trees, and distinguished the waters and soils. The Four Peaks assisted him, surveying the four directions, reaching where human traces seldom ventured and carriages and boats rarely arrived. Within, he demarcated the mountains of the five regions; without, he divided the seas of the eight directions. He recorded their treasures and marvels, the waters, soils, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects native to distant lands, the abodes of qilin and phoenix, the concealments of auspicious omens, and the foreign states beyond the four seas, the strange peoples of remote domains. Yu divided the Nine Provinces, apportioned tribute according to the land, and Yi and others categorized the good and ill of creatures, compiling the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. These are all the legacy of the sagely and wise, the luminous records of antiquity. Their accounts are plain, clear, and trustworthy.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, an exotic bird was once presented. When it was fed, no other creature would eat the same food. Dongfang Shuo saw it and named the bird, further stating what it should eat—just as he had said. When asked how he knew, he replied that it was recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, a stone was struck in Shang Commandery, collapsing to reveal a stone chamber. Within was a man bound in reverse with shackles. At the time, your servant Xiu’s father, Xiang, served as Remonstrance Grandee. He identified the man as the minister of Erfu. When asked how he knew, he too cited the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, which states: “Erfu killed Yayu. The Emperor then bound him to a mountain of distant kinship, fettering his right foot and binding his hands behind his back.” The Emperor was greatly astonished. From then on, many at court marveled at the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Scholars of literature and great Confucians all studied it, deeming it extraordinary. It can be used to examine auspicious omens and strange transformations, to witness the customs and songs of distant lands and foreign peoples. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: “To speak of the most recondite matters in the world without confusion—such is the breadth of the gentleman of wide learning.” Your servant Xiu, risking death, respectfully presents this.\n\n**Scroll One of the Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n\n**Account of Guo Pu**\n\n**The Southern Mountains Classic**\n\nThe first of the *Southern Mountains Classic* is called Shei Mountain.\n\nIts foremost peak is known as Mount Zhaoyao, which overlooks the Western Sea. It lies in Fushan of Shu, where the western end of the southern mountains borders the Western Sea. The mountain abounds with cassia trees, their leaves resembling those of the loquat, over two *chi* in length and several *cun* in width, with a pungent taste. Their white blossoms cluster upon the mountain peaks, remaining verdant through winter and summer, with no other trees interspersed. As the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: “The cassia of Mount Zhaoyao.” The mountain also yields much gold and jade.\n\nThere is a kind of herb here, resembling leeks—*Pu notes: “Leeks,” pronounced *jiu*. The *Approaching Elegance* also records their abundance in the mountains of Shu.*—yet bearing blue-green flowers. It is called *zhuyu* (or sometimes *guicha*). Those who consume it will know no hunger.\n\nThere is also a tree whose form resembles the paper mulberry (*Pu notes: The paper mulberry is also called *gou*; it is named *gu* because its fruit resembles grain.*) but with black grain. Its blossoms radiate light in all four directions—*Pu notes: This refers to luminous brilliance. The *Songs of Chu* speaks of the “crimson blossoms of the Ruo Tree, whose light illumines the earth,” which is of the same kind.*—and it is named *migu*. Those who carry it will never lose their way.\n\nThere is an animal here resembling a *yu*—*Pu notes: The *yu* resembles a macaque but is larger, with red eyes and a long tail, and is commonly found in the mountains south of the Yangtze. Some accounts fail to clarify this creature. It is called *yu*, written with the character for “ox,” and depicted in illustrations as ox-like (or sometimes as a monkey), though both are incorrect.*—but with white ears. It moves swiftly on all fours and is called the *xingxing*. Those who eat it will gain fleetness of foot. The *shengsheng* (*Pu notes: A kind of *yu* beast resembling an ape, moving on all fours with its limbs intertwined, belongs to the same category.*) is recorded in Jing Fang’s *Book of Changes*.\n\nThe Lili River—*the character is pronounced *ji*—flows from this mountain, coursing westward into the sea. Its waters abound with *yupei* (details unknown). Those who carry it will be free from *hen* diseases—*Pu notes: *Hen* refers to parasitic ailments.*\n\nThree hundred *li* farther east lies Mount Tang (or sometimes written as *Chang*).\n\nMount Ting is rich in *yan* trees—*yan* is also called *lian*; its fruit resembles the *su* but is red and edible. (*Pronounced* yǎn.) The mountain abounds with white apes. Modern apes resemble macaques but have longer arms and legs, are agile and swift, and come in black and yellow hues. Their cries are mournful. It also yields *water jade*, which is today’s crystal. As the *Shanglin Fu* states: “Water jade gleams in heaped abundance.” This was what Master Red Pine consumed, as recorded in the *Lives of the Immortals*. The mountain is also rich in gold.\n\nThree hundred and eighty *li* farther east lies Mount Yuanyi. It teems with strange beasts and its waters with strange fish. The term “strange” refers to creatures of grotesque and unusual form. As *Master Shi* notes: “King Xu of Yan loved the strange. He plunged into deep waters to obtain strange fish and ventured into deep mountains to capture strange beasts, many of which he displayed in his court.” The mountain also yields white jade and harbors *belly worms*—*fu* worms with patterns like embroidered ribbons, a needle-like proboscis, and specimens weighing over a hundred *jin*; another name is *fanbi*. (*Fu* is the ancient form of *hui*.) It abounds with strange serpents and strange trees, making ascent perilous.\n\nTwo hundred and seventy *li* farther east lies Mount Niuyang. (*Pronounced* niǔ.) Its southern slopes yield abundant red gold—*copper*—while its northern slopes yield white gold—*silver*, as recorded in the *Erya*. (The southern side of a mountain is called *yang*; the northern side, *yin*.) There is a beast here whose form resembles a horse but with a white head, tiger-like markings, and a red tail. Its cry is like a chant, akin to human song. It is called the *lushu*, and wearing its pelt ensures descendants. (*Wearing* refers to bearing its skin or tail.) A strange river flows from here, coursing eastward into the Xianyi River. Its waters teem with dark turtles whose form resembles a tortoise but with a crow’s head and viper’s tail—the tail tapers sharply. It is called the *xuan* turtle, and its cry resembles the sound of splitting wood. Wearing it prevents deafness and can be used for *treatment*. (*Treatment* here means healing.)\n\nThe *Outer Transmission* states: \"Illness cannot be treated\"—*or* \"healed\"—*means the disease has abated.*\n\nThree hundred *li* to the east lies Mount Di. Its waters are abundant, but no grasses or trees grow there. A fish dwells here, its form resembling an ox, dwelling on the hills. It has a serpent’s tail and wings, with feathers beneath its flanks. Its cry is like that of a plowing ox. *Master Zhuang* says: \"The dog that herds the plow\"—referring to this ox. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* records: \"The Son of Heaven’s hounds seize tigers and leopards.\" It is called the *lu*, pronounced *liu*. It dies in winter and revives in summer, belonging to the hibernating kind. When it is said to \"die,\" this means it lies dormant, senseless as the dead. Eating it prevents swelling ailments.\n\nFour hundred *li* farther east stands Mount Danyuan, pronounced *chan*. Its waters are plentiful, but no grasses or trees grow, nor can one ascend it—so sheer and towering is it. A beast dwells here, its form like a wildcat but with a mane. It is called the *lei*, also written as *peimao* or *fa*. It is self-sufficient as both male and female; those who consume it are free from jealousy. *Master Zhuang* likewise says: \"The *lei* transforms as both female and male.\" The *huan* pig of today does the same.\n\nThree hundred *li* to the east lies Mount Ji. Its southern slopes yield much jade; its northern slopes, strange trees. A beast dwells here, its form like a sheep, with nine tails and four ears, its eyes set in its back. It is called the *boshe*, pronounced *bo* and *shi* (or *yi*). Wearing it dispels fear—all dread and terror.\n\nThere is a bird here, its form like a chicken but with three heads, six eyes, six feet, and three wings. Its name is pronounced *ji* and *xing*, also read as *chang* and *hu* in two other tones. Consuming it prevents sleep.\n\nThree *li* further east lies Mount Qingqiu. There is also a Qingqiu Kingdom beyond the seas. The *Water Classic* states: this is the same as the \"Qingqiu\" mentioned in the *Rhapsody on the Imperial Park*, where \"autumn hunts are held at Qingqiu.\" Its southern slopes yield much jade; its northern slopes, abundant dark *qing*. *Qing* belongs to the *you* category, pronounced *hu*. A beast dwells here, its form like a fox but with nine tails—this is the nine-tailed fox. Its cry resembles an infant’s and it devours humans. Eating it wards off *gu*; consuming its flesh protects one from encountering malevolent and demonic *qi*. Some say: *gu* refers to *gu* poison.\n\nThere is a bird here, its form like a turtledove, its cry like a scolding voice, akin to humans berating one another. It is called the *guan'guan*, also written as *guan*. Wearing it prevents confusion.\n\nThe Ying River flows forth from here, coursing southward into the Marsh of Jiyi. Within it abound red *ru*, pronounced *ru*. Their form is like fish but with a human face, and their cry resembles that of mandarin ducks. Eating them prevents scabies. Some texts write this as \"illness.\"\n\nFurther east three hundred and fifty *li* stands Mount Jiwei. Its tail stretches into the Eastern Sea, abundant with sand and stone. *Cun* is an ancient form of *dūn*, meaning \"to overlook the sea.\" Pronounced *cún*. The Fang River flows forth from here, pronounced *fāng*, coursing southward into the Xiao, pronounced *yù*. Within it abounds white jade.\n\nFrom the first of the *Quxian* Mountains—beginning at Mount Zhaoyao and extending to Mount Jiwei—there are in all ten mountains spanning two thousand nine hundred and fifty *li*. Their spirits all bear avian bodies and draconic heads. The rites for their worship prescribe: *mao* refers to selecting a living sacrifice by its fur color. As the *Rites of Zhou* states: \"For yang sacrifices, use the fur of intoxicated animals.\" One *zhang*-jade is buried, a half-*gui* serving as the *zhang*. *Yì* means \"to bury.\" The sacrificial grain is *xǔ*-rice, the refined rice for offering to spirits. Pronounced *xiān lǚ* in ancient times; in the Jiangdong region, it is read as *suǒ*, also pronounced *xǔ*. *Xú* is glutinous rice, pronounced *tā dǔ*. *Xǔ* is sometimes written as *shū*, which is incorrect. One *bì*-jade, glutinous rice, and a mat of white *jiān* are used. *Jiān* is a kind of grass akin to reeds, pronounced *jiān*.\n\nThe first mountain of the *Nan Ci Er Jing* is called Mount Ju, pronounced *jǔ*. To its west lies Liuhuang; to its north, Zhupi; to its east, Changyou—all mountain names. The Ying River flows forth from here, coursing southwest into the Red Water. Within it abounds white jade. As the *Shizi* states: \"Where water bends sharply, there is jade; where it curves smoothly, there are pearls.\" It also holds much cinnabar grain, fine cinnabar like millet.\n\nThere is a beast here, its form like a suckling pig but with spurs. Its cry resembles a dog’s bark, and it is called the *lili*. Where it appears, the county will see much earthwork. There is a bird here, its form like an owl but with human hands, its feet likewise like human hands. *Chī* is pronounced *chǔ zhī*. Its cry resembles *bì*, and its name is uncertain, called *yā*, pronounced *zhū*. It calls its own name, and where it appears, the county will see many exiled scholars. *Fàng* means \"banishment,\" though some write it as *xiào*.\n\nFour hundred and fifty *li* to the southeast stands Mount Changyou. Devoid of vegetation, it abounds in water. There is a beast here, its form like a *yu* but with four ears, named the *changyou*, after the mountain from which it emerges. Its cry resembles a moan, like a human’s groaning. Where it appears, the commandery and county will suffer great floods.\n\nFurther east three hundred and forty *li* stands Mount Yaoguang. Its southern slopes abound in jade; its northern slopes, in metal. There is a beast here, its form like a human but with a boar’s mane, dwelling in caves and hibernating in winter. It is called the *huáguǒ*, pronounced *huá huái*. Its cry resembles the chopping of wood, like the sound of a man hewing timber. Where it appears, the county will see great labor service—or some say, great disorder.\n\nFurther east three hundred and fifty *li* stands Mount Yu. In present-day Zhuqi County of Donghai, to the southwest, lies Mount Yu, the very place where Gun met his fate. Calculating the distances, however, they do not align, suggesting this may not be the case. Below it abounds water; above it, rain. Devoid of grass and trees, it teems with vipers.\n\nFurther east three hundred and seventy *li* stands Mount Qúfù. There is no grass or trees, but much metal and jade.\n\nFurther east four hundred *li* stands Mount Gōuxiàn. There is no grass or trees, but much metal and jade. Today, it lies south of Yuyao County and north of Gouzhang County in Kuaiji, whence these two counties derive their names, as recorded in Zhang’s *Treatise on Geography*.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Fúyù. To its north lies Jùqū—present-day Taihu Lake southwest of Wuxian, called Zhènzé in the *Book of Documents*. To its east lie the Zhūpí waters. There is a beast here, its form like a tiger but with an ox’s tail, its cry like a barking dog. It is called the *fù*, and it devours humans. The Tiáo River issues from its northern slopes, flowing northward into Jùqū. Its waters abound in *cǐ* fish, long and slender with elongated heads, measuring over a *chi* in the largest specimens. Today, they are plentiful in Taihu Lake. Also called the *dāo* fish, pronounced *chánqǐ*.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Chéng. Square in shape with three tiers, its form resembles stacked altars built by human hands. *Chéng* also means \"double-eared.\" Above, it abounds in metal and jade; below, in dark *qīng* stone. The *Zhuō* River issues from it, flowing southward into Hūsháo. *Hū* is pronounced like *chē*; *sháo* is sometimes written with the water radical. Its waters abound in yellow gold. Today, in Yongchang Prefecture, gold like chaff is found in the sands. As the *Shīzi* states: \"Clear waters yield yellow gold, Wang Ying.\"\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Kuaiji, square in shape. Today, it lies south of Shanyin County in Kuaiji Prefecture, atop which stands Yu’s tomb and well. Above, it abounds in metal and jade; below, in *fū* stone. *Fū* is pronounced *fù*; it resembles jade, now unearthed in Linxiang of Changsha. Its surface bears red earth and white veins, its hues blending like green onions, indistinct. The Sháo River issues from it, flowing southward into the Jú.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Yí. Devoid of grass and trees, it abounds in sand and stone. The Jú River—also written as *sǔn*—issues from it, flowing southward into Lietú.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Púgōu—also written as *Xī*. Above, it abounds in metal and jade; below, in grasses and trees. There are no birds or beasts, nor any water.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Xiányīn. Devoid of grass, trees, and water.\n\nFurther east four hundred *li* stands Mount Xún—also written as *Xún*. Its southern slopes abound in metal; its northern slopes, in jade. There is a beast here, its form like a sheep but without a mouth, impervious to harm. It sustains itself on qi alone. It is called the *□*.\n\nThe sound *huán* (or *huàn*). The Xún River issues from it, its sound *xún*, flowing southward into the Marsh of Guān, its sound *è*. Within it grows much *bìléi*.\n\nFurther east four hundred *li* stands Mount Mósháo. Above, it abounds in catalpa and nanmu—*nan*, a divine tree of the mountains, its form grand, its leaves resembling the mulberry. Now written as 楠 (*nán*), the *Erya* identifies it as *nán*. Below, it abounds in *kèqǐ*—*qǐ*, the matrimony vine, its berries red. The Pāng River issues from it, its sound like the *pāng* of *pāngtuó*, flowing eastward into the sea.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Qūwú. Devoid of grass and trees, it abounds in sand and stone. The Lù River issues from it, flowing southward into the Pāng River.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Lùwú. Above, it is devoid of grass and trees, but abounds in metal and stone. The Zégēng River issues from it, flowing southward into the Pāng River. Within its waters dwells a beast named *gǔdiāo*—*gǔ* also written as *zuǎn*. Its form resembles an eagle but with horns, its cry like that of an infant; it devours humans.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Qīwú. Devoid of grass and trees, it abounds in *bó* stones but no jade. These stones may serve as the base for the game of *bó*. Situated east of the sea, when gazing toward Qiū Mountain, its radiance emerges and recedes—where the divine light lies concealed and shines. This is the station of the sun, where the sun’s shadow converges.\n\nIn all, from the beginning of the \"Southern Second Classic\" at Mount Jù to Mount Qīwú, there are seventeen mountains spanning seven thousand two hundred *li*. Their spirits all bear dragon bodies and avian heads. For their sacrifices: the offering consists of one jade *bì* buried in the earth, and refined rice as the essence.\n\nThe \"Southern Third Classic\" begins with Mount Tiānyú. Below, it abounds in water, rendering ascent impossible.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Dǎoguò. Above, it abounds in metal and jade; below, in rhinoceroses and *sì*—the rhinoceros resembles a water buffalo, with a pig’s head, a broad mouth, feet like an elephant’s, three hooves, a large belly, and black hide. It bears three horns: one on its head, one on its brow, and one on its snout. The horn on its snout is small and does not fall; it is the horn it feeds upon. It delights in gnawing, its mouth ever frothing with bloody spittle. The *sì* also resembles a water buffalo, its hide blue, its two horns weighing three thousand *jīn*. There are many elephants—the largest of beasts, with long trunks. The largest tusks reach a *zhàng* in length. Jealous by nature, they do not tolerate the young of other males.\n\nThere is a bird here, its form like a swan-goose, resembling a wild duck but smaller, its feet near its tail—its sound like the *qiāo* of *qiāojiàn*. It has a white head, three feet (or hands), and a human face. Its name is *qúrú*, its sound *qú*. Its cry is its own name.\n\nThe Yín River issues from it, its sound *yín*, flowing southward into the sea. Within it dwells the *hǔjiāo*—a *jiāo* resembling a serpent with four feet, akin to a dragon. Its form is that of a fish’s body with a serpent’s tail, its cry like that of a mandarin duck. Those who consume it do not swell, and it may cure hemorrhoids.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Dānxué. Above, it abounds in metal and jade. The Dān River issues from it, flowing southward into the Bó Sea—the Bó Sea being the curved headland of the sea’s shore. There is a bird here, its form like a chicken, adorned with five-colored patterns. Its name is *fènghuáng*. The markings on its head signify virtue; on its wings, righteousness; on its back, propriety; on its breast, benevolence; and on its belly, trust. This bird drinks and eats naturally, singing and dancing of its own accord. When it appears, the world knows peace. In the Han era, the *fèng* bird emerged several times, standing five or six *chǐ* tall, its five colors resplendent. Zhuāngzǐ’s account of the *fèng*’s markings differs from this. The *Guǎngyǎ* states: the *fèng* has a chicken’s head, a goose’s throat, a serpent’s neck, a tortoise’s back, and a fish’s tail. The female is called *huáng*, the male *fèng*.\n\nFurther east five hundred *li* stands Mount Fāshuǎng.

Its heights yield much gold and jade, and its lower slopes abound in green *□*.\n\nThere is a tree here whose form resembles the *gǔ* tree but with red grain. Its sap is like lacquer, and its taste like malt sugar. Those who eat it never hunger, and it can relieve fatigue. Its name is *bái□* (or written as *gāosū*). *Gāosū* is also called *bái□*, as recorded in the *Guǎngyǎ*, pronounced like *gāo*. It can be used to \"blood\" jade—meaning it can dye jade to enhance its luster.\n\nFurther east five hundred and eighty *li* stands Mount Yúgǎo. It abounds in monstrous beasts and giant serpents.\n\nFurther east five hundred and eighty *li* lies Mount Nányú. Its heights yield much gold and jade, and its lower slopes abound in water. There is a cave here: in spring, water enters it; in summer, it emerges; and in winter, it seals shut. The Zuǒ River issues forth here, flowing southeast into the sea. The *fènghuáng* and *yuānchú* (also of the *fèng* kind) dwell here.\n\nIn summary, the beginning of the \"Southern Mountains: Third Classic\" spans from Mount Tiānwú to Mount Nányú, comprising fourteen mountains over a distance of six thousand five hundred and thirty *li*. The spirits of these mountains all have dragon bodies and human faces. Their sacrifices involve one white dog, and the offering is called *qí* (prayer).

Its heights abound in gold, its lower slopes in silver, and its trees are mostly *niu* and *jiang*. Its birds are mostly *yingwu*. The Chu River flows forth, coursing southward into the Wei. Its depths hold many white pearls. Today, the marshes of Shu Commandery yield green pearls. As the *Shizi* states: \"Where water bends and swirls, pearls are found.\"\n\nOne hundred and fifty *li* farther west lies Mount Gao. Its heights abound in silver, its lower slopes in azure jade (jade-like *bi* is also produced in the eastern mountains of Yuexi and Kuaiji counties) and realgar. In the third year of the Daixing era of the Jin, a landslide in Gaoping Commandery unearthed several thousand *jin* of realgar. Its trees are mostly *nan*, and its grasses are mostly bamboo. The Jing River (pronounced like *jing* in \"classic\") flows forth, coursing eastward into the Wei. Today, the Jing River rises in the western wellspring mountains of Kongdingchao County and enters the Wei at Gaoling County in Jingzhao. Its depths hold much *qing* stone (as the *Book of Documents* says: \"floating *qing* from the Si River banks\"). It also abounds in azure jade.\n\nThree hundred *li* to the southwest lies Mount Nüchuang. Its southern slopes abound in red copper, its northern slopes in alum stone (also called *nie* stone; the people of Chu call it *nie* stone, while the Qin call it *yu nie*; the *Shennong Bencaojing* also calls it *shi nie*). Its beasts are mostly tigers, leopards, rhinoceroses, and water buffaloes. There is a bird here, shaped like a *di* but with five-colored patterns (the *di* resembles a pheasant but is larger, with a long tail; or sometimes written as *□□*, a type of eagle). It is called the *luan* bird, and its appearance heralds peace throughout the land. Old accounts say the *luan* resembles a chicken, a propitious bird. It was presented as tribute by the Western Rong during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou.\n\nTwo hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Longshou. Its southern slopes abound in yellow gold, its northern slopes in iron. The Tiao River rises here and flows southeast into the Jing River. Within it are many fine jades.\n\nTwo hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Lutai, now located in Shang Commandery. Its summit abounds in white jade, its base in silver. Its beasts are mostly *□* oxen, *xian* sheep, and white *hao*. (*Hao* refers to the *huan* pig.) There is a bird here, shaped like a rooster but with a human face, called the *fuxi*. Its name is its own cry, and its appearance heralds war.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the southwest lies Mount Niaowei. Its southern slopes abound in sounding stones, its northern slopes in sandalwood and paper mulberry (*chu*, also called *gu* wood). Within it are many *nüchuang* (unverified). The Wuwei River rises here and flows west into the Chi River, containing much cinnabar grain.\n\nFour hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Xiaoci. Its summit abounds in white jade, its base in red copper. There is a beast here, shaped like an ape but with a white head and red feet, called the *zhuyan*. Its appearance heralds great war. (One version says its appearance heralds the rise of six armies; another says it heralds warfare.)\n\nThree hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Daci. Its southern slopes abound in chalk (*e*, white as earth; pronounced *wu*), its northern slopes in azure jade. Its beasts are mostly *□* oxen and antelopes.\n\nFour hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Xunwu. It has no vegetation but abounds in gold and jade.\n\nFour hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Diyang (pronounced *zhi*). Its trees are mostly *ji*, *gou*, and *yuzhang*. (*Ji* resembles pine, with thorns and fine grain; pronounced *ji*. *Yuzhang* is a large tree resembling the *jiu*, its leaves evergreen in winter and summer; its nature becomes known only after seven years of growth.) Its beasts are mostly rhinoceroses, water buffaloes, tigers, dogs, and *□* oxen. (*Zhuo* is pronounced *zhiyao*.)\n\nTwo hundred fifty *li* farther west lies Mount Zhongshou. Its summit abounds in *□fu* jade, its base in sandalwood and paper mulberry, and much yellow gold. Its beasts are mostly rhinoceroses and water buffaloes.\n\nFive hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Huangren. Its summit abounds in gold and jade, its base in azure orpiment (also called *cihuang*; some say it includes *kongqing* and *zengqing*). The Huang River rises here and flows west into the Chi River, containing much cinnabar grain.\n\nThree hundred *li* farther west lies Mount Zhonghuang. Its summit abounds in yellow gold, its base in *huitang* (a type of *tongtang*; *hui* may also be written as *gao*).\n\nThree hundred fifty *li* farther west lies Mount Xihuang. Its southern slopes abound in gold, its northern slopes in iron. Its beasts are mostly elk and *□* oxen. (The *mi* is as large as a small ox, a type of deer.)\n\nThree hundred fifty *li* farther west lies Mount Lai. Its trees are mostly sandalwood and paper mulberry, and its birds are mostly *luoluo*, which devour humans. (The *luoluo* bird remains unverified.)\n\nIn all, the beginning of the *Western Second Classic* spans seventeen mountains from Mount Qian to Mount Lai, covering four thousand one hundred forty *li*. Of its ten spirits, all have human faces and horse bodies. Of its seven spirits, all have human faces, ox bodies, four legs, and one arm, wielding staffs as they walk—these are the spirits of flying beasts. Their sacrifices use the *shaolao* (a sheep and pig as the *shaolao*). White *jian* grass is used for mats. (The *bei* in \"ten *bei*\" is pronounced *bei*.)\n\nFor the spirits, their sacrifices use one rooster, *qian* but no *xu*. (*Qian* is the name of a sacrificial vessel, unverified; or it may mean \"to pray for instruction without *xu*.\" Sacrifices do not use rice. *Maocai* refers to using a multicolored rooster.)\n\nThe beginning of the *Western Third Classic* is Mount Chongwu. Located south of the River, to the north it overlooks Mount Zhongsui (a mountain name), to the south it overlooks Duoyao Marsh (pronounced *yao*), to the west it overlooks the Emperor’s *Boshou* Hill (*bo* may also be written as *bu*), and to the east it overlooks *□* (pronounced *yuran*) Abyss. There is a tree here with round leaves and white *fu* (nowadays, people south of the Yangtze call the seed pods of plants *fu*, pronounced *fu*; one version says *fu* is the calyx beneath the flower, pronounced like the character for \"husband\"; or it may be written as *fu*, pronounced *fu*). Its flowers are red with black veins, and its fruit resembles the *zhi*. Eating it benefits descendants.\n\nThere is a beast here, shaped like a *yu* but with patterned arms, resembling a leopard or tiger and skilled at throwing, called the *Jufu* (or *Kuafu*). There is a bird here, shaped like a wild duck but with one wing and one eye; they must pair to fly, called the *Manman* (the *biyi* bird). Its color is greenish-red, and it cannot fly alone. (*Erya* writes it as *□□* bird.) Its appearance heralds great floods throughout the land.\n\nThree hundred *li* to the northwest lies Mount Changsha. The Ci River (pronounced *zi*) rises here and flows north into the You River (*jiao* is pronounced *jiao*; also pronounced *you*, meaning \"black water\"). It has no vegetation but abounds in azure orpiment.\n\nThree hundred seventy *li* farther northwest lies Mount Buzhou. This mountain’s form has gaps, hence its name. The northwest *buzhou* wind originates from this mountain. To the north, it overlooks Mount Zhupi and faces Mount Yuechong; to the east, it overlooks You Marsh, where the River lies hidden. Its source surges turbulently. (The River emerges from Kunlun, flows underground, and resurfaces at Congling in the state of Yutian. It then splits, converges, and flows east into You Marsh, where it hides again before emerging south at Jishi Mountain as the Chinese River. You Marsh is also called Pu Marsh or Puchang Sea, spanning three to four hundred *li*. Its waters stagnate, neither increasing nor decreasing in winter or summer. It lies over three hundred *li* from Yumen Pass and is the River’s secondary source, referred to as the \"hidden flow.\" *Hunhun paopao* describes the sound of surging water. Both *gun* and *pao* are pronounced accordingly.)\n\nHere grows a fine fruit. Its fruit resembles the peach, its leaves the jujube. Its flowers are yellow with red *fu*. Eating it prevents fatigue.\n\nFurther northwest four hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Mi. Its name is pronounced *mi*. Atop it grow many cinnabar trees—round-leaved with crimson stems, bearing yellow blossoms and red fruit. Their taste is like maltose; eating them banishes hunger. The Cinnabar River rises here, flowing west into Ji Marsh. The Divine Farmer Hou Ji drowned in it, hence the name. Within it lies abundant white jade, and there is a jade nectar. Its source seethes and surges, the very appearance of jade nectar welling forth. The *River Chart Jade Tablet* states: “On Shaoshi Mountain grows white jade nectar; one dose and one becomes immortal.” This is of the same kind. *Fei* is pronounced *fu*.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor consumed and offered it. Thus he ascended the dragon at Ding Lake and shed his mortal form. From it is born dark jade, meaning all black jade emerges from the jade nectar. Where the jade nectar flows, it irrigates the cinnabar trees. After five years, the cinnabar trees assume the five colors and become radiant—meaning their luster shines. Their five flavors become fragrant, meaning their aroma is rich. The Yellow Emperor then gathered the jade blossoms of Mount Mi—referring to the jade’s splendor. The *Li Sao* says: “I cherish the splendid blossoms of the pepper tree,” and again: “I ascend Kunlun to feast on jade blossoms.” This is the jade spoken of in the *Ji Tomb Writings* as “Cao Hua’s jade.” He cast it upon the southern slopes of Mount Zhong to serve as jade seed.\n\nThe finest jade is that of *jin* and *yu*, meaning it is most excellent. Some write it as “to consume.” Both *jin* and *yu* are pronounced accordingly. Its grain is firm, fine, and dense—this describes the jade’s texture. The *Book of Rites* says: “Its density resembles millet,” where *su* may also be written as *li*. Jade with millet-like veins is called *gu bi*. It is lustrous despite its turbid richness—*zhuo* here means thick and moist. The five colors emerge in interplay, meaning their hues reflect one another. Prince Lingfu’s *Divine Talisman* states: “Red as a rooster’s comb, yellow as steamed millet, white as sliced fat, black as pure lacquer—these are the jade’s divine hues.” It harmonizes softness and hardness, meaning jade embodies the nine virtues.\n\nHeaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, consume and offer it. Jade is used in prayers and sacrifices because it can move Heaven and Earth and stir ghosts and spirits. The noble person wears it to ward off misfortune. Nowadays, beyond the borders, adamantine stone is produced. It belongs to the stone family yet resembles metal, gleaming and capable of carving jade. Foreigners carry it, saying it repels malign qi—this is of the same kind.\n\nFrom Mount Mi to Mount Zhong spans four hundred and sixty *li*, all marshland. There abound singing birds, strange beasts, and wondrous fish—all extraordinary creatures.\n\nFurther northwest four hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Zhong. Its child is named Gu, also a divine name, simply called the child of Mount Zhong. Their forms are recorded in the *Returning to the Hidden: Divination of Qi*. They resemble humans with dragon bodies. The *Divination of Qi* says: “The child of Li Mountain has green feathers, eight faces, and a horse’s body.” This form is similar. They, along with Qin □ (pronounced *pi*), slew Bao Jiang on the southern slopes of Kunlun. *Bao* may also be written as *Zu*. The Emperor executed them east of Mount Zhong at □ (pronounced *yao* with a cliff radical). Qin □ transformed into a great osprey—*e*, of the eagle family, pronounced □. Its form resembles an eagle but with black patterns, a white head, red beak, and tiger claws. Its cry is like the morning swan—*chen hu*, of the osprey family, meaning “morning brightness.” The *Garden of Persuasion* says: “The county’s barking dogs compare to serving the morning swan.” When it appears, great war follows. Gu also transformed into a *jun* bird (pronounced *jun*). Its form resembles an owl, with red feet and a straight beak, yellow patterns and a white head. Its cry is like a swan’s. When it appears, its domain suffers severe drought. The *Tale of King Mu* says: “Mount Zhong heralds spring,” though the pronunciation is the same.\n\nKing Mu journeyed north beyond this mountain to survey the four wilds and declared: “Mount Zhong is the highest mountain under Heaven, where all beasts gather and flying birds roost.” There are red leopards, white tigers, white crows, and green eagles, seizing dogs and sheep, devouring boars and deer. King Mu observed Mount Zhong for five days, then inscribed his traces upon the hanging gardens to instruct later generations.\n\nFurther west one hundred and eighty *li* lies Mount Taiqi. The Guan River rises here, flowing west into the Flowing Sands. There abound patterned *yao* fish (pronounced *yao*). They resemble carp but with fish bodies and bird wings, azure patterns and white heads, red beaks. They constantly travel the Western Sea, roaming the Eastern Sea, and fly by night. Their cry is like the *luan* chicken—*luan ji*, a bird name, not yet identified. Some write it as *le*. Their flavor is sour-sweet; eating them cures madness. When they appear, the world enjoys great abundance—*feng rang*, meaning bountiful harvests. The *Hanzi* says: “In the autumn of a rich year.”\n\nFurther west three hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Huaijiang. The Qiushi River rises here, flowing north into the You River.\n\nWithin this mountain dwell many *yingmu*, which are spiral conch shells. Its heights abound in green *xionghuang* (realgar) and conceal *langgan*, gold, and jade. *Langgan* refers to stones resembling pearls. *Cang* means \"hidden.\" Pronounced *lang* and *gan*. Its southern slopes yield many cinnabar grains, while its northern slopes yield fine gold and silver.\n\nThis is truly the Emperor’s level garden, that is, the Dark Garden. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"Thereupon he inscribed his traces upon the Dark Garden,\" meaning he carved stone to record his merits and virtues, as the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han did.\n\nThe spirit Yingzhao presides over it. *Si* means \"to govern.\" Pronounced *shao*. His form is that of a horse’s body with a human face, tiger stripes, and bird wings, patrolling the four *mei*. *Xun* means \"to circumnavigate.\" His cry is like the *liu* (sound *liu*, sometimes written as *zhou*), though its meaning remains unclear.\n\nGazing south toward Kunlun, its radiance blazes like a bear, its *qi* billowing and surging—such is the intensity of its fiery brilliance and vital force. Gazing west toward the great marsh, this is where Hou Ji was concealed. Hou Ji was born divine; even in his hidden transformations, he followed this marsh and became its spirit.\n\nTo the north, one sees Mount Zhupi, where the spirit Huaigui Lilun resides. Lilun is the name of this deity. It is the dwelling place of eagles and *zhan* (a kind of hawk, related to the owl). Zhuangzi said: \"Owls delight in mice.\" *The Chronicle of King Mu* records: \"On Mount Zhongshan there are white crows and azure eagles,\" all of this kind.\n\nLooking east toward Mount Heng, which has four *cheng* (layers). *Cheng* also means \"layers.\" *The Erya* states: \"Two layers are called *ying*.\" The spirit Youqiong resides here, each group occupying one *bo*. *Bo* means \"flank,\" indicating that the various spirits gather by kind and dwell on the four flanks of the mountain. *Youqiong* is their general name. *Bo* is sometimes written as *chuan*.\n\nHere flows the Yin Water, its clarity rippling in gentle waves. *Luo-luo* describes the water’s descending flow; *yu* is pronounced like *yao*. Within resides a celestial spirit, its form like an ox, yet with eight legs, two heads, and a horse’s tail. Its voice resembles *Bo Huang* (the nature of *Bo Huang* remains unclear). Wherever it appears, war befalls the nearby settlements.\n\nFour hundred *li* to the southwest lies the Kunlun Range, the true Lower Capital of the Thearch, the celestial abode of the Heavenly Emperor below. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"On the auspicious day *xin-you*, the Son of Heaven ascended Kunlun’s heights to behold the Yellow Emperor’s palace, and there sealed the burial of Feng Long, bequeathing it to later generations.\" This speaks of the augmented burial upon Kunlun’s summit. The spirit Lu Wu governs it—Lu Wu being the same as Jian Wu. Zhuangzi said: \"Jian Wu received it to dwell upon the great mountain.\" This spirit has the body of a tiger, nine tails, the face of a human, and tiger claws. It oversees the nine divisions of heaven and the seasons of the Thearch’s gardens, presiding over the boundaries of the nine celestial domains and the seasonal adornments of the Heavenly Emperor’s parks.\n\nThere is a beast here, its form like a sheep but with four horns, called *Tu Lou*, which devours humans. There is a bird, its form like a wasp but as large as a mandarin duck, named *Qin Yuan* (*Qin* may also be written as *You* or *Zhi*). Where it stings beasts, they die; where it stings trees, they wither. There is another bird, named *Chun Niao*, which oversees the Thearch’s myriad implements—*fu* meaning \"utensils\" or, alternatively, \"service.\" Elsewhere, there is a tree resembling the *tang* (pear), with yellow blossoms and red fruit. Its taste is like a plum but without a pit, called *Sha Tang*. It can ward off drowning, and those who eat it shall not sink. (The text here is fragmentary.) *Sha Tang* is a wood that cannot... (text incomplete). *The Annals of Lü Buwei* states: \"Among the finest fruits is the fruit of the *Sha Tang*.\" An inscription reads: \"...*Sha Tang*... carved into a boat, drifting upon the azure sea, to roam and wander.\"\n\nThere is a herb named *□-grass* (pronounced *pin*), its form like the mallow, its taste like the scallion. Eating it cures fatigue. *The Annals of Lü Buwei* states: \"Among the finest vegetables is the *□* of Kunlun.\" The Ke Water issues forth from the mountain’s northeast corner, flowing southward and eastward into Wu Da (a mountain name). The Chi Water emerges from the southeast corner, flowing southeast into Fan Tian’s waters (Fan Tian being another mountain, where the Chi Water ends). *The Chronicle of King Mu* records: \"Thereupon he lodged beside Kunlun, on the yang (north) side of the Chi Water.\" *Yang* refers to the north bank of a river; *fan* is pronounced with the *fu* and *jian* initials.\n\nThe Yang Water flows from the northwest corner (sometimes written as *Wei*). It courses southwest into Chou Tu’s waters (Chou Tu being another mountain, all located in the southern extremity). *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"On *wu-chen*, he crossed the Yang Water,\" also called \"the Son of Heaven’s Yang Water.\" The Hei Water also issues from the northwest corner, flowing west into Da Yu (a mountain name). *The Chronicle of King Mu* records: \"Thereupon he sealed the burial of Chang Gong west of the Hei Water’s western river, declaring it the summit of Kunlun’s Hong Lü, to serve as the Zhou royal house’s presiding spirit.\" *Gan* is pronounced *yu*. The region abounds in monstrous birds and beasts—such as a single beast with nine heads or a bird with six heads.\n\nThree hundred and seventy *li* farther west lies Mount Le You. The Tao River flows from it, coursing west into Ji Marsh, where white jade is plentiful. Within dwell many *□-fish* (pronounced *yu*), their form like a serpent but with four legs, which prey upon fish.\n\nTraveling four hundred *li* west by waterway and two hundred *li* farther reaches Mount Ying Mu, governed by the spirit Chang Cheng, who embodies the nine virtues of heaven—the vital *qi* of the nine virtues. This spirit resembles a human but with a *you*-like tail (pronounced with the *zhuo* and *yao* initials). The mountain’s heights are rich in jade, its lower slopes in green stone, yet it lacks water.\n\nThree hundred and fifty *li* farther west lies Jade Mountain, the dwelling of the Queen Mother of the West. This mountain abounds in jade and stones, hence its name. *The Chronicle of King Mu* calls it the Mountain of Myriad Jades, noting its unobstructed rivers and roads, all aligned as if by a carpenter’s line, the so-called \"strategic treasury\" of the former kings. Sparse in grass and trees, devoid of birds and beasts, King Mu there quarried its jade and stones, taking three chariot-loads of jade slabs, jade utensils, and ceremonial objects, carrying ten thousand *zhi* of jade back with him. (Two jades make a *ke*; half a *ke* makes a *zhi*.)\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West resembles a human, with a leopard’s tail, tiger’s fangs, and a penchant for howling. Her hair is disheveled, and she wears a *sheng* (a jade hairpin, pronounced *pang*). She governs heaven’s calamities and the Five Destructions, presiding over the *qi* of disasters, plagues, and the five punishments of execution. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"On the auspicious day *jia-zi*, the Son of Heaven was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West. He presented a *gui* tablet of jade and a white jade disc, offering a hundred rolls of dark silk and three hundred rolls of deep blue silk. The Queen Mother of the West bowed twice and accepted them. On *yi-chou*, the Son of Heaven toasted the Queen Mother of the West upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West sang for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*White clouds drift in the sky,*\n*The mountains and hills arise on their own.*\n*The roads stretch far and wide,*\n*Mountains and rivers lie between.*\n*May you not die, my lord,*\n*And come again.*\n\nThe Son of Heaven responded:\n*I return to the eastern lands,*\n*To harmonize and govern the central states.*\n*When the myriad people are equitable and at peace,*\n*I shall see you again.*\n*Within three years,*\n*I shall revisit your wilds.*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then chanted for the Son of Heaven:\n*Dwelling in the western lands,*\n*Abiding in your place,*\n*Tigers and leopards gather in packs,*\n*Crows and magpies keep you company.*\n*Auspicious fate does not depart,*\n*For I am the Thearch’s daughter.*\n*What manner of mortal are you,*\n*Who would now leave me?*\n*Blowing the sheng and striking the reed pipes,*\n*My heart soars freely.*\n*O child of this generation,*\n*You are heaven’s hope.*\n\nThereupon the Son of Heaven was moved. He ascended Yan Mountain, inscribed his traces upon its stones, and planted a locust tree, declaring: 'This is the Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West.'\"\n\nYan Mountain is Mount Yanzi. According to the *Bamboo Annals*, in the fifty-seventh year of King Mu’s reign, the Queen Mother of the West came to audience and was received as a guest in the Bright Palace. In the time of Shun, the Queen Mother of the West dispatched envoys to present jade rings, as recorded in the *Rites of the Three Courts*.\n\nThere is a beast whose form resembles a dog but bears leopard markings, with horns like those of an ox—or sometimes a ram. Some call it the *jiao*, and its cry is like a barking dog. Wherever it appears, the land enjoys great abundance.\n\nIn the tenth year of the Tai Kang reign of Jin, a beast was captured in a cage in Fuyi County of Shaoling. Its form bore leopard markings, with two horns but no forelegs. The people of the time took it for the *jiao*, though this was uncertain.\n\nThere is a bird whose form resembles a pheasant but is red, called the *shengyu*, of the *Ting* clan. It feeds on fish, and its cry is like *lu* (音绿), though the meaning is unclear. Wherever it appears, the land suffers great floods.\n\nFour hundred and eighty *li* further west lies the Mound of Xuanyuan. No grasses or trees grow there. The Yellow Thearch dwelt upon this mound and took a daughter of the Western Mound clan as his wife, whence it is called the Mound of Xuanyuan. The Xun River (音询) issues forth from here, flowing southward into the Black River. Its waters abound with cinnabar grains and much green realgar.\n\nThree hundred *li* further west stands Mount Jishi. At its base lies a stone gate through which the River waters surge westward—*mao* meaning \"to cover.\" Mount Jishi is located among the Qiang tribes southwest of Jincheng and Hemen Pass, where the River waters course [through gaps] and enter the passes from the east. This mountain contains all things under heaven.\n\nThe *Classic of Waters* cites the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, stating: \"Mount Jishi lies east of Denglin Mountain, where the River enters.\"\n\nTwo hundred *li* further west lies Mount Changliu, where the White Thearch Shaohao resides. Shaohao, of the Metal Heaven clan, is the title of Thearch Zhi. The beasts here all bear patterned tails—or sometimes long ones. The birds all bear patterned heads—or sometimes long ones. The mountain abounds with patterned jade stones. It is in truth the palace of the Round Spirit Kui (音隗). This spirit governs the reflection of light. When the sun sets in the west, its light is reflected eastward, and the spirit oversees its observation.\n\nTwo hundred and eighty *li* further west lies Mount Zhangyi. No grasses or trees grow there, but it abounds with *yao* jade and *bi* jade (*bi* being another kind of jade). The phenomena there are most strange, and many extraordinary things are found.\n\nHerein dwells a beast resembling a red leopard, with five tails and one horn, its cry like the striking of stone—its name is *Zheng*. As the *Jing Shi Yi Yi* states: \"Its sound is like stones striking one another,\" meaning its voice is tranquil.\n\nHerein dwells a bird resembling a crane, with one foot, red markings on a green body, and a white beak—its name is *Bifang*. It cries its own name, and where it appears, the town suffers strange fires. (*E* here signifies the character for \"portent\" or \"misfortune.\")\n\nThree hundred *li* further west lies Mount Yin, whence the turbid *Zhuoyu* River flows southward into Fan Marsh. Within it abound patterned cowries, of the kind described in the *Erya*. Herein dwells a beast resembling a leopard—or sometimes a wildcat—with a white head, named *Tiangou*. Its cry is like *liuliu*—or sometimes *miaomiao*. It can ward off misfortune.\n\nTwo hundred *li* further west lies Mount Futì. Its heights abound with *□ge* trees, its depths with gold and jade. The spirit Jiang Yi resides here. This mountain is the source of strange rains, winds, and clouds.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty *li* further west lies Mount Sanwei, now located in Dunhuang Prefecture. As the *Book of Documents* states: \"The Three Miao were exiled to Sanwei.\" Three azure birds dwell here. This mountain spans a hundred *li* in circumference. The three azure birds serve the Queen Mother of the West by fetching her food, though they rest separately upon this mountain. The *Bamboo Annals* record: \"King Mu, on his western campaign, reached the place where the azure birds alighted.\"\n\nHerein dwells a beast resembling an ox, with a white body, four horns, and fur like a rain-repelling straw cloak—its name is *Ao□* (*Ao* or *Yi* in pronunciation). It devours humans.\n\nHerein dwells a bird with one head and three bodies, resembling a *□* (a bird akin to an eagle, with black markings and a red neck)—its name is *Chi*. (*Luo* in standing posture. A later line, possibly misplaced here, reads: \"If one grasps its talons, death follows; if one grasps its roots, withering ensues.\" This should belong beneath the *Yinyuan* entry above.)\n\nOne hundred and ninety *li* further west lies Mount Gui. Its heights abound with jade but lack stone. The spirit Qi Tong resides here—Qi Tong being the Old Child, son of Zhuanxu. Its voice is ever like the ringing of bells and chimes. Its depths teem with coiled serpents.\n\nThree hundred and fifty *li* further west lies Mount Tian. It abounds in gold and jade, and contains green realgar. The Ying River flows from here, coursing southwest into Tang Valley. Herein dwells a spirit resembling a yellow sack, red as cinnabar fire, its body yellow yet radiant with crimson light. It has six legs and four wings, is utterly formless, without face or eyes, yet knows song and dance—it is indeed the Emperor Jiang. For when form is incomplete, the spirit becomes naturally numinous; when essence is unseen, it merges with principle—does this not describe the Emperor Jiang? Zhuangzi’s tale of the Central Emperor Hundun, who died when Shu and Hu drilled his seven apertures, is but a parable drawn from this.\n\nTwo hundred and ninety *li* further west lies Mount You (*You*, pronounced like the \"you\" in \"dark\"). The spirit Mu Shou resides here.\n\nHere also resides a metal spirit, human-faced with tiger claws, a white tail, and holding a *yue*-axe—so recorded in the *Outer Traditions*. Its summit abounds in *yingduan* jade, though the term remains undetermined. On its sunlit slopes lie many *jinyu* jades, while its shaded side holds abundant green realgar. This mountain stands where the sun sets in the west; its *qi* is round, the sun’s form is round, and thus its celestial aspect is likewise round. It is governed by the spirit of Crimson Radiance, though its appearance has not been described.\n\nProceeding west by water for a hundred *li* brings one to Mount Yiwang (or, as some write, Mount Tucui). No grasses or trees grow here, but gold and jade are plentiful. A beast dwells here, shaped like a wildcat, with one eye and three tails—its name is *Huan* (pronounced like \"joy,\" sometimes written *Yuan*). Its cry resembles a hundred voices, for it can mimic the sounds of a hundred creatures. (Some say *Huan* is a creature’s name, though this remains unverified.) It wards off misfortune, and wearing its pelt cures *zhang*-illness (yellow *zhang*-disease, pronounced like \"dawn\"). A bird also lives here, shaped like an ordinary bird but with three heads, six tails, and a fondness for laughter—its name is *Qiyi* (awaiting the two missing pronunciations). Consuming it prevents *yan*-dreams (dream-oppression; in the *Book of Zhou*, *yan* means \"unrestful,\" pronounced like *moli* in reverse; some say it refers to blurred vision). It, too, wards off misfortune.\n\nFrom the first mountain of the Third Western Range, Mount Chongwu, to Mount Yiwang, there are twenty-three mountains spanning six thousand seven hundred and forty-four *li*. Their spirits all take the form of sheep-bodied, human-faced beings. The rites for their worship require burying a single auspicious jade (a jade adorned with colors; the *Master Shi* states: \"Auspicious jade is a great tortoise\"). The offering of essence uses glutinous millet.\n\nThe first mountain of the Fourth Western Range is called Mount Yin. Its heights are rich in grains but devoid of stone, and its grasses are mostly *mao* and *fan* (*mao* is *jikui*; *fan* is green *fan*, resembling sedge but larger; *mao* has two pronunciations). The Yin River flows from here, coursing west into the Luo. Fifty *li* to the north lies Mount Lao, where this grass grows in abundance. It is also called *eryi*, its center dyed purple. The Weak River flows from here, running west into the Luo.\n\nFifty *li* further west stands Mount Bafu. The Er River (pronounced like \"ear\") rises here, flowing west into the Luo, and its waters hold much purple jasper. One hundred seventy *li* to the north lies Mount Shen, whose heights abound in *guzuo* grain and whose lower slopes bear many *niu* and *ju* trees. Its sunlit side yields gold and jade. The Qu River flows from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the north lies Mount Niao. Its heights are thick with mulberry trees, its lower slopes with paper mulberries, its shaded side with iron, and its sunlit side with jade. The Ru River flows from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nOne hundred twenty *li* further north stands Mount Shangshen. No grasses or trees grow on its heights, but many *luo* stones lie there (*luo*, pronounced like \"stone,\" refers to large rocks). Its lower slopes bear many hazel and *hu* trees (hazelnuts resemble chestnuts but are smaller and sweet; *hu* wood is used for arrows; the *Book of Songs* says: \"Hazel and *hu* grow thickly\"; *hu* has two pronunciations). Its beasts are mostly white deer, and its birds mostly *danghu* (sometimes written *hu*). Shaped like pheasants, they fly by means of their throat whiskers (the whiskers beneath the throat). Eating them prevents dizziness.\n\nThe Tang River flows forth from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nOne hundred eighty *li* further north stands Mount Zhuci. The Zhuci River flows from this mountain, running east into the Yellow River. This mountain abounds in trees but has no grasses; neither birds nor beasts dwell here, though it teems with serpents.\n\nOne hundred eighty *li* further north stands Mount Hao. Its trees are mostly lacquer trees (the lacquer tree resembles the *chun* tree). Its grasses include many medicinal herbs: *yao*, *xi*, and *xiongqiong*. *Yao* is another name for *baizhi*. *Xi* is a fragrant grass. *Xiongqiong* is also called *jiangli* (pronounced *wu jiao* in reverse). It also abounds in *ling* stones (the character *ling* may also be pronounced *jin*, though this is uncertain). The Duan River flows from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nTwo hundred twenty *li* further north stands Mount Yu (pronounced *yu*). Its northern slopes bear much iron, and its southern slopes much copper. Its beasts are mostly white wolves and white tigers.

This place abounds in white jade.\n\nFifty-five *li* further west stands Mount Jinggu (some omit the characters \"Mount\" and \"gu\"). The Jing River flows from here (some identify this as the present-day Jing River, though this is uncertain), running southeast into the Wei River. This place abounds in white gold and white jade.\n\nOne hundred twenty *li* further west stands Mount Gang. It abounds in firewood trees and *fufu* jade. The Gang River flows from here, running north into the Wei River. This place teems with divine *chi* (*chi* are a kind of *chimei*; pronounced *chi hui you*, or sometimes written with another character). They have human faces and beastly bodies, one foot and one hand, and their cries sound like *qin* (*qin* is a loan character for *yin*).\n\nTwo hundred *li* further west, at the tail of Mount Gang, the Luo River flows forth, running north into the Yellow River. Within it dwell many *manman*, creatures with the bodies of rats and the heads of turtles, whose cries sound like barking dogs.\n\nThree hundred fifty *li* further west stands Mount Yingdi. Its heights abound in lacquer trees, and its lower slopes in gold and jade. Its birds and beasts are entirely white. The Wo River flows from here (the character *wo* may also be written with another character, pronounced like *yuan* in *yuanwang*), running north into the Lingyang Marsh. This place abounds in *ranyi* fish, creatures with the bodies of fish and the heads of serpents, six feet, and eyes like horse ears. Eating them prevents sleep and wards off misfortune.\n\nThree hundred *li* further west stands Mount Zhongqu. Its southern slopes abound in jade, while its northern slopes bear much realgar, white jade, and gold. A beast dwells here, resembling a horse with a white body and black tail, one horn, tiger’s teeth and claws, and a cry like drumbeats. It is called the *bo* and devours tigers and leopards. The *Erya* describes the *bo* without mentioning its horn or tiger claws, though it appears in the *Changshou* illustrations. It can ward off weapons—raising it repels blades.\n\nThere grows a tree here, resembling the crabapple in form, with round leaves and red fruit. Its fruit is as large as a quince—*quince* like the character *gua* (瓜). It is called the *xiang* tree, pronounced like *huai*. Eating it grants great strength. The *Shizi* states: \"Those who eat of trees often become benevolent, named as if by water. This is of that kind.\"\n\nTwo hundred and sixty *li* further west stands Mount Bang, pronounced like *gui*. At its summit dwells a beast resembling an ox, covered in hedgehog-like quills, called the *qiongqi*. It is like a mastiff and devours humans. Some say it resembles a tiger, with quills and wings.

Thus it is also named the divine hound.\"\n\nThe Meng River, pronounced *meng*, rises here, flowing south into the Yang River. Within its waters abound yellow cowries—cowries being shelled creatures with bodies like tadpoles, possessing only heads and tails.

When it appears, the region suffers great floods.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty *li* further west lies the mountain known as Bird-and-Mouse-Same-Burrow. Today it stands southwest of Shouyang County in Longxi. The mountain harbors birds and mice that share a burrow: the bird is called *□*, the mouse *□*. The mouse resembles a house mouse but with a short tail; the bird is like a swallow but yellow in color. They tunnel several *chi* into the earth, the mouse dwelling within, the bird without, yet living together. The *Kongshi Shangshu Commentary* states they mate as male and female. The *Zhangshi Dili Ji* claims they do not. Its summit abounds in white tigers and white jade.\n\nThe Wei River rises here, flowing east into the Yellow River. It emerges from the mountain’s east, reaching Hongnong’s Huayin County before entering the river. Within its waters dwell many *sao* fish, pronounced like *sao*, resembling the *zu* fish (a large fish with its mouth beneath its chin and a body covered in connected scales). Some write it as *nianli*. When they stir, the region faces great warfare. (Some texts omit the phrase \"when they stir\" and what follows.)\n\nThe Lan River, pronounced *kan*, rises to its west, flowing west into the Han River. It teems with *□□* fish, pronounced like *piliang*, resembling an overturned *diao* (a cooking vessel), with a crow’s head, fish’s wings, and fish’s tail, its cry like the sound of a chime stone. They produce pearls and jade—akin to pearl-oysters, yet capable of birthing them.\n\nThree hundred and sixty *li* southwest stands Mount Yanzi, the mountain where the sun sets, as mentioned in the *Li Sao*. Pronounced *yanzī* (two readings). Its summit abounds in cinnabar trees, their leaves like millet, their fruit as large as melons, red in texture with black veins. Eating them cures malaria and can ward off fire. Its southern slopes teem with tortoises; its northern slopes, with jade. The *Tiao* River (or *Ruo* River, as some write it) rises here, flowing west into the sea. The *Yu Da Zhuan* states: \"The Weipan River rises from Mount Yanzi.\" Within its waters abound whetstones—fine ones called *di*, coarse ones *li*.\n\nA beast dwells here, resembling a horse in body but with crow’s wings, a human face, and a serpent’s tail. It delights in lifting people, often embracing and raising them. It is called *shuhu*. A bird also dwells here, resembling an owl but with a human face, a *wei*-monkey’s body (the *wei* being a kind of macaque, pronounced like *zengyi* or *zhu*), and a dog’s tail (or back, as some texts have it). Its name is its own cry. Some write it as *she*, meaning it also calls thus—this may be a textual error. When it appears, the region suffers severe drought.\n\nIn all, the fourth western section, from Mount Yin to Mount Yanzi, comprises nineteen mountains spanning three thousand six hundred and eighty *li*. For their sacrifices, one white chicken is used in prayer, with glutinous rice as the offering, and white *jian* grass as the mat.\n\nIn total, the Western Mountains record seventy-seven mountains, spanning seventeen thousand five hundred and ten *li.\n\n*Western Mountains Classic: Illustrations and Eulogies*\n*Xian Yang*\n\nThe Moon-Race Sheep\nA breed most wild, the Moon-Race sheep stands—\nsix feet in height, its tail as red as a horse’s.\nHow know this true?

Three*\n*Guo Pu’s Commentary*\n\n*The Northern Mountains: First Section*\nThe first mountain of the *Northern Mountains* is called *Shan-Hu*. It abounds in *Ji* trees—*Tao* wood resembling elm, which may be burned to fertilize rice fields. It comes from *Shu*. Its name is pronounced *Ji*. Upon its heights grow many flowering plants. The *Feng* River rises here (pronounced *Feng*) and flows westward into the *You* River, where many *Bi* stones and patterned stones are found.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty *li* farther north lies *Qiu-Ru* Mountain. Its summit holds much copper; its base, much jade. No grasses or trees grow there. The *Hua* River (here called the *Xu* River) issues forth and flows westward into the *Zhu-Pi* River, which rises in *Zhu-Pi* Mountain. Within its waters dwell many *Hua* fish (here called *□* fish). Their form resembles the eel, with red backs. The *□* fish resembles the serpent (pronounced *Shan*). Their cries are like the sound of *wu* (as in the phrase *wu-zi wu*, the call of one man to another). Eating them cures warts (warts being growths). The river also teems with *water horses*: their shape is that of a horse, with striped forelegs and an ox’s tail (forelegs being the front limbs). As *The Rites of Zhou* states: “A horse with a black back and mottled forelegs is called *lü*.” In the fourth year of *Yuan-Shou* during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, horses emerged from the *Wo-Jia* waters of *Dun-Huang* as a numinous portent—these were of the same kind. Their cries resemble human shouts.\n\nTo the north by three hundred li lies *Dai* Mountain. Its heights abound in jade, its depths in azure-green *bi* stone.

Upon seeing humans, it calls out; it is named *Zuzhui*, and its cry is its own name. There also dwells a bird resembling a female pheasant but with a human face; upon seeing humans, it leaps—named *Songsi*, its cry is its own name. The *Jinhan* River rises here, flowing westward into *You* Marsh, and its waters abound in lodestone, which can attract iron. *Cishi* (lodestone)—as *Guanzi* states: \"Where lodestone lies above, copper lies below; thus may it be retrieved.\"\n\nFurther north by one hundred and eighty *li* lies *Danzhang* Mountain. Its heights bear no grasses or trees. There dwells a beast resembling a leopard, with a long tail, human head, oxen ears, and a single eye—named *Zhujian*, pronounced like *jian* in *jianniu* (castrated ox). It roars fiercely, walking with its tail in its mouth and resting with its tail coiled. There also dwells a bird resembling a pheasant but with a patterned head, white wings, and yellow feet—named *Baiye*, pronounced *ye*. Eating it cures throat pain—*ai* (throat), as in the *Guliang Commentary*: \"The throat admits no grain.\" The people of Wu call the throat *ai*, pronounced *ai*. It can also cure *chi* (epilepsy)—*chi* refers to convulsive illness. The *Li* River rises here, flowing southward into the *Gang* River.\n\nFurther north by three hundred and twenty *li* lies *Guanti* Mountain. Its heights abound in *chu* (ailanthus) and *zhe* (cudrania), its lower slopes in quicksand and whetstones. There dwells a beast resembling an ox but with a white tail; its cry resembles a human call—*tao* pronounced *jiao*. It is named *Nafu*. There also dwells a bird resembling a female pheasant but with a human face; upon seeing humans, it leaps—named *Songsi*, its cry is its own name. The *Jianghan* River rises here, flowing westward into *You* Marsh, and its waters abound in lodestone, which can attract iron. As *Guanzi* states: \"Where a mountain bears lodestone above, copper must lie below.\" *Cishi* pronounced *ci*.\n\nFurther north by two hundred *li* lies *Panhou* Mountain. Its heights abound in pines and cypresses, its lower slopes in hazels and *hu* (lespedeza); its southern face is rich in jade, its northern in iron. There dwells a beast resembling an ox but with hair growing from its joints—named *maoniu* (yak). Today, the yak’s back, knees, and dewlap all bear long hair.

Their yellow blossoms bear pods, called *□* (pronounced *tuōluò*), which can cure drowsiness.\n\nThere is a beast here, resembling a field mouse but with striped brows—*□* (a variant of *huǐ*, though the creature remains obscure). It is called *□* (pronounced *nà*, sometimes rendered as *bear*), and eating it cures goiter.\n\nTwenty *li* east lies Mount Lì’ér. Its heights are dense with oak and *lì* trees (pronounced *lì*). This tree has square stems and round leaves, yellow and downy, with fruit like the *liàn* tree (a type of tree; its seeds resemble fingertips, white and sticky, used for washing clothes—pronounced *liàn*, sometimes written as *jiǎn*). Consuming it sharpens memory.\n\nFifteen *li* east stands Mount Qúzhū. Its heights are thick with bamboo. The Qúzhū River flows southward from here into the Yellow River. Its waters teem with *háoyú* (variant note: shaped like the *wěi* fish, which resembles the *zhān*), with red beaks and red-feathered tails, which can cure white scaling.\n\nThirty-five *li* east rises Mount Cōnglóng. Its valleys are vast, rich in white chalk, black-green, and yellow chalk (indicating multicolored chalk).\n\nFifteen *li* east lies Mount Wō (pronounced *wō*). Its heights yield red copper, its northern slopes iron.\n\nSeventy *li* east stands Mount Tuōhù. Here grows a grass resembling mallow leaves with red blossoms, its pods like *□* pods (modern *□* pods resemble *zàojiá*). Called *zhíchǔ*, it can cure *shǔ* (a wasting disease; as the *Huainanzi* states, \"fox heads cure *shǔ*\"). Eating it prevents insomnia.\n\nTwenty *li* east rises Mount Jīnxīng. It abounds in *tiānyīng*, shaped like dragon bones, which can cure *cuó* (boils and sores).\n\nSeventy *li* east lies Mount Tàiwēi. Within it is a valley called Xiāo Gorge, rich in iron (some editions omit \"valley\").\n\nFifteen *li* east stands Mount Jiāng Gorge (or in some editions, *Tán Gorge*), where red copper is plentiful.\n\nOne hundred twenty *li* east rises Mount Wúlín, dense with *jiān* grass (also written *jiān*).\n\nThirty *li* north lies Mount Niúshǒu. (Modern Chang’an’s southwest has a Mount Niúshǒu, with a bend above and water below, though it is unclear if this is the same.) Here grows *guǐ* grass, its leaves like mallow with red stems, its tassels like grain. Consuming it dispels sorrow. The Láo River flows westward from here into the Qīng River (pronounced like *zhé*, meaning \"to deceive\").\n\nThe waters teem with flying fish, shaped like *fù* fish, which cure hemorrhoids.\n\nForty *li* north rises Mount Huò. (Modern Pingyang’s Yong’an County, Lujiang’s Jì County, Jin’an’s Luójiāng County, and Henan’s Gǒng County all have Mount Huò, for mountains named Huò are not unique. As the *Erya* states: \"A great mountain encircling a lesser one is called Huò.\") Its woods are rich in grain. There is a beast here, resembling a leopard but with a white tail and mane, called *nǎonǎo*. Raising it can dispel sorrow (pronounced *pǔzhū*, meaning \"to keep and nurture\").\n\nFifty-two *li* north lies Mount Hégǔ, dense with *yánjí* (obscure; pronounced *zhān*).\n\nThirty-five *li* north lies Mount Yīn, also called Mount Xiǎn. It abounds in whetstones and patterned stones. (Whetstones are those used for grinding.) A small stream flows from here, and it teems with *diāotáng* trees, whose leaves resemble elm leaves but are square, and whose fruit resembles red beans. (Beans are called *shū*.) Consuming it cures deafness.\n\nFour hundred *li* northeast stands Mount Gǔdèng, rich in red copper. There is a grass here called *róng* grass, with leaves like willow and a root like a chicken’s egg. Eating it cures wind disorders.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Bó Mountains, from Mount Gānzǎo to Mount Gǔdèng, there are fifteen mountains spanning six thousand six hundred and seventy *li*. (This is the domain of the *Lì’ér* clan.) Their sacrificial rites require: for the animal offering, the full *tàiláo* ritual implements; for the hanging, auspicious jade. (*Xiàn* is the name for mountain sacrifices, as recorded in the *Erya*.) For the remaining thirteen mountains, the animal offering is a single sheep, and the hanging uses a *sāngfēng*—a mulberry tablet, square at the base and tapered at the top, with a hole in the center adorned with metal. (This refers to crafting a spirit tablet for worship, decorated with gold or silver. As the *Gōngyáng Zhuàn* states: \"The tablet for Yu the Great was made of mulberry.\" *Zhǔ* may also be written as *wáng*.)\n\nThe second section of the Central Mountains, the Jǐ Mountains, begins with Mount Huīzhū. Its heights are dense with mulberry trees, its beasts with *lǘ* deer, and its birds with *hé*.\n\nThe creature resembles a pheasant but bears patterns, its plumage blue-green and feathered. Fierce and valiant, it fights to the death. Its cry resembles *yì*. It emerges from Shangdang.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the southwest lies Mount Fāshì. Its heights abound in gold and jade, its depths in whetstones. The waters of Jíyú Spring arise here, flowing into the Yi River.\n\nThree hundred *li* to the west stands Mount Háo. Its heights teem with gold and jade, yet bear no grass or trees.\n\nThree hundred *li* farther west rises Mount Xiān. Gold and jade fill its slopes, but no grass or trees grow there. The Xiān River originates here, flowing northward into the Yi. Within its waters dwell *míng* serpents, shaped like snakes but with four wings. Their cries ring like chime-stones; where they appear, great drought befalls the land.\n\nThree hundred *li* to the west lies Mount Yáng. Its slopes are stony, devoid of grass or trees. The Yáng River emerges here, coursing north into the Yi. Within it lurk *huà* serpents, their forms like human faces on jackal bodies, with bird wings and serpentine movement. Their voices resound like shouts; where they appear, floods ravage the land.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the west stands Mount Kūnwú. Its heights yield abundant red copper—this may be the famed copper, fiery-hued as flame. Forged into blades, it cuts jade as if slicing mud. The Western Rong presented it to King Mu of Zhou. As the *Shīzǐ* records, these were the swords of Kūnwú. The *Yuèjuéshū* states: \"When Mount Chìjīn split, tin emerged; when the valley of Ruòyē dried, copper appeared. Ōuyězǐ used them to forge the *tōnggōu* swords.\" A bronze sword unearthed from a tomb in Jí Prefecture measured three *chǐ* and five *cùn*—now called the *Gānjiāng* sword. The Jí region also lacked iron, proving that ancient weapons were made by alloying copper with tin.\n\nA beast dwells here, its form like a hedgehog’s but horned, its cry like a human’s wailing. Named *lóngchí*, it was mentioned earlier—likely the same creature. Consuming its flesh prevents nightmares.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* to the west lies Mount Jiān (sound uncertain). The Jiān River rushes forth, flowing north into the Yi. Its heights brim with gold and jade, its depths with green *xiónghuáng*. A tree grows here, its form like a crabapple but with red leaves, called *máng* grass (sound *wàng*). It can poison fish.\n\nOne hundred and fifty *li* farther west stands Mount Dúsū. Barren of grass and trees, it abounds in water.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the west rises Mount Mànqú. Its heights yield *jīnyú*, its depths bamboo arrows. The Yi River originates here, flowing east into the Luo. (Now, the Yi rises northeast of Xióng’ěr Mountain in Lúshǐ County of Shàngluò, entering the Luo at Luòyáng in Hénán.)\n\nA beast inhabits this place, named *mǎfù*, its form like a human face on a tiger’s body. Its cry resembles an infant’s wail, and it devours humans.\n\nIn all, the first section of the Jǐ Mountains—from Mount Huīzhū to Mount Mànqú—comprises nine mountains spanning one thousand six hundred and seventy *li*. Their spirits bear human faces and avian bodies. For sacrifices, animal offerings are used, selected by fur color. A single auspicious jade is cast, without *xǔ* grain.\n\nThe third section of the Central Mountains, the Pín Mountains, begins with Mount Áo’àn (or *Xiànbèi*, sound *bèi*). Its southern slopes yield *fúfū* jade, its northern slopes ochre and yellow gold. The spirit Xūnchí dwells here, often producing fine jade—sometimes from stone. Gazing northward toward the Hé forests, their forms resemble *qiàn* and *jǔ* trees. (Commentators say *qiàn* and *jǔ* are tree names, though details remain unclear. *Qiàn* is pronounced *qiàn*.)\n\nA beast roams here, its form like a white deer but with four antlers, named *fūzhū*. Where it appears, floods engulf the land.\n\nTen *li* to the east stands Mount Qīngyào, the true secret capital of the Thearch. It is the hidden city of the Celestial Emperor.\n\nGazing northward toward the bend of the Hé, where the river winds a thousand *li*—one curve, one straight stretch. Here abound *jià* birds, though their nature remains unclear. Some say *jià* should be *jiā*, meaning \"goose.\" *Jiā* is pronounced *jiā*.\n\nLooking south toward Dànzhǔ, a small islet in the waters (Dàn is pronounced *chán*). This is where Yǔ’s father transformed—Gǔn was metamorphosed in the Yǔ Abyss into a yellow bear. Yet here it is said again, suggesting that one possessed of mutable and wondrous nature may transform anywhere without limit. Here also thrive *pú-lěi* and *pú-lú*. *Pú-lěi* are snails; the *Ěryǎ* states: *pú-lú* are *mínglíng*.\n\nWǔluó presides over this place—Wǔluó being the name of the spirit. The graph is the character for \"spirit.\" His form is human-faced but marked with leopard stripes, slender-waisted with white teeth. Some texts write \"head\" instead of \"teeth.\" His ears are pierced with *jù*, a name for vessels of gold and silver, though details remain unclear. *Jù* is pronounced *qú*. His cry rings like jade pendants chiming, as if a man’s voice sounding jade ornaments.\n\nThis mountain is fitting for women. The Zhěn River issues forth here (Zhěn is pronounced *zhěn*) and flows northward into the Hé. Within it dwells a bird named *yǎo* (pronounced like the *yǎo* in *yǎotiǎo*). Its form resembles a wild duck, with a green body, vermilion eyes, and a crimson tail. Eating it promotes fertility. (Vermilion here denotes a pale red.)\n\nThere is also a grass here, its form like *jiān* (a kind of rush, resembling a sprout), with square stems, yellow flowers, and red fruit. Its base resembles *gǎo* stalks, its roots like *gé* roots—also a fragrant herb. It is called *xún* grass, or sometimes *bāo* grass. Consuming it enhances a woman’s beauty, making her even more radiant.\n\nFurther east ten *li* stands Mount Guī (pronounced *wēi*). At its summit grow fine jujubes, and in its northern shade lies □-fù jade. The Zhènghuí River issues forth here, flowing northward into the Hé. Within it abound flying fish, their form like a suckling pig marked with red patterns. Consuming them dispels fear of thunder and may be used to repel weapons.\n\nFurther east forty *li* rises Mount Yísū. Its heights abound in gold and jade, its lower slopes in *mànjū* trees (meaning unclear). The Yōngyōng River (pronounced *róng*) emerges here, flowing northward into the Hé, where many yellow cowries are found.\n\nFurther east twenty *li* stands Mount Hé. Its soil bears no grass or trees but is rich in fine jade and azure jasper. In truth, it is the Nine Capitals of the Hé—where the nine rivers converge, hence the name Nine Capitals. This mountain winds in five bends, each bend coiling fivefold. The nine rivers issue forth here, merging as they flow northward into the Hé. Within them lie many dark jades.\n\nThe auspicious spirit Tàiféng presides over it (auspicious meaning propitious). His form resembles a man with a tiger’s tail (or, in some versions, a mouth-tail). He delights in dwelling on the southern slopes of Mount Fù, and his comings and goings are accompanied by light. The spirit Tàiféng stirs the qi of heaven and earth—his numinous power can summon clouds and rain.\n\nIn summer, at the mouth of... beneath Mount Fù, a great wind arose, plunging the sky into darkness. Kǒng Jiǎ lost his way... (see *Lüshi Chunqiu*).\n\nFrom the head of Mount Fù—beginning at Mount Áo’àn and extending to Mount Hé—there are five mountains spanning four hundred forty *li*.\n\nThe sacrifices to the spirits Tàiféng, Xūnchí, and Wǔluó each require one male sheep, its bones crushed and scattered in offering (副副 refers to breaking the sheep’s bones and scattering them as ritual fragments; see *Rites of Zhou*, pronounced as the sincerity of kǔnbì). Fine jade is used for the main offering. For the secondary spirits, one rooster is buried, with xú-grain from Xú as the sacrificial grain.\n\nFrom *The Fourth Classic of the Central Mountains* (音狸, pronounced lí):\nThe first mountain is called Lùtí. Its summit abounds in jade, its base in gold. The Gān River issues forth here, flowing northward into the Luò. Within it lie many *líng*-stones (未闻也; *líng* may also be written as *tú*).\n\nFifty *li* to the west stands Fúzhū Mountain, rich in *ruǎn*-stone (音耎; modern Yànmén Mountain also yields *ruǎn*-stone, white as ice, some with red veins). There dwells a beast resembling a raccoon dog but with human eyes (貉 or an ancient variant). Its name is *Yín* (音银, sometimes written as 麋). The Hào River flows from here, northward into the Luò, bearing many *ruǎn*-stones (said to emerge from water).\n\nOne hundred twenty *li* farther west lies Lí Mountain. Its southern slopes yield jade, its northern slopes *sōu* (音搜; *máo-sōu* is today’s madder grass). A beast dwells here, ox-like with a gray body, its cry like an infant’s—it devours humans and is called the Xīqú. The Yōngyōng River flows from here, southward into the Yī. Another beast, named *Xié* (音苍颉之颉), resembles a shaggy dog but with scales, its fur like a reversed mane.\n\nTwo hundred *li* west stands Jīwěi Mountain, with many valleys and *xú*-stones, its heights rich in *fúfú*-jade.\n\nTwo hundred fifty *li* farther west rises Qī Mountain, its summit laden with jade, its base with copper. The Tāodiāo River flows from here, northward into the Luò, bearing many *xián*-sheep. A tree grows here, resembling the *chū* in form, its leaves like the tung tree’s but bearing pods—it is called *bá* and can poison fish (*bá* may also be written as *ài*).\n\nTwo hundred *li* west lies Báibiān Mountain, its heights rich in gold and jade, its base in dark realgar.\n\nTwo hundred *li* farther west stands Xióng’ěr Mountain (now south of Shàngluò County). Its summit abounds in lacquer trees, its base in *qiū* (a type of oak). The Fúháo River flows from here, westward into the Luò, bearing many water-jades and *rén*-fish. A herb grows here, resembling the *sū* but with red blossoms, called *tíngníng* (亭宁, pronounced *tíng* or *níng*). It can poison fish.\n\nThree hundred *li* west rises Zhuàng Mountain, its heights rich in patterned stone, its base in arrow bamboo and *zhú*-bamboo. Its beasts include *lí*-oxen and *xián*-sheep; its birds, many red *jīng* (音闭, the pheasant *biē*).\n\nThree hundred fifty *li* farther west stands Huānjǔ Mountain. The Luò River flows from here, northeastward into the Xuánhù River, bearing many *mǎcháng*-creatures. These two mountains lie between the Luò (the Luò now rises in Zhǒnglǐng Mountain of Shàngluò County). As the *River Chart* states: “Xuánhù at the confluence of the Luò,” referring to this region.\n\nIn all, the mountains from Lùtí to Xuánhù number nine, spanning one thousand six hundred seventy *li*. Their spirits all have human faces and beast bodies. Their sacrifices require a white rooster, offered in prayer without *xú*-grain (meaning only supplication is made). The rooster is adorned with colored silks (彩衣 refers to decorating the bird with dyed fabrics).\n\nFrom *The Fifth Classic of the Central Mountains*:\nThe first of the Bó Mountains is Gǒuchuáng (or Gǒulín Mountain). It bears no grass or trees, only strange stones (resembling jade; as the *Book* says: “Lead pines and strange stones”).\n\nThree hundred *li* east stands Shǒu Mountain. Its northern slopes abound in oak and *gǔ* trees, its grasses in *jì*-thistles and *yuán*-blossoms (*jì* is the mountain thistle; *yuán*-blossoms are used in medicine). Its southern slopes yield *fúfú*-jade, its trees many locust trees. To the north lies a valley called Jī Valley, home to many *dì*-birds (音如钳釱之釱), resembling owls but with three eyes and ears, their cries like *lù*—eating them cures swelling (未闻).\n\nThree hundred *li* east stands Xiànzhú Mountain (音如斤斸之冲). It bears no grass or trees, only patterned stone.\n\nThree hundred *li* east lies Cōnglóng Mountain, barren of grass and trees but rich in *qiū*-stone (未详).\n\nFive hundred *li* northeast stands Tiáogǔ Mountain. Its trees include locust and tung, its grasses peony and *kuàndōng* (the *Classic of Herbs* calls it *mǎndōng*; now written as 门, commonly as 耳).\n\nTen *li* north stands Chāo Mountain. Its northern slopes abound in dark jade; its southern side holds a well, full in winter but dry in summer.\n\nFive hundred *li* east rises Chénghóu Mountain. Its heights bear many *chūn* trees (resembling *chū*, used for chariot shafts; in Wú dialect, *chūn* is pronounced like *chūn*-chariot or *yóu*-chariot), its grasses many *péng*.\n\nFive hundred *li* east stands Cháogē Mountain, its valleys rich in fine chalk.\n\nFive hundred *li* east lies Huái Mountain, its valleys abundant in gold and tin.\n\nTen *li* east stands Lì Mountain, its trees many locusts, its southern slopes rich in jade.\n\nTen *li* farther east lies [unnamed] Mountain, bearing dark jade and many *jīng*-deer (small, black deer).\n\nThe Shī River flows from here, southward into the Luò, bearing many fine jades.\n\nTen *li* east stands Liángyú Mountain. Its heights abound in oak and *gǔ* trees, but no stone. The Yú River flows from its northern slopes, northward into the Hé. The Rǔ River flows from its southern slopes, southeastward into the Luò.\n\nTen *li* southeast stands Gǔwěi Mountain, rich in whetstones and red copper. The Lóngyú River flows from here, southeastward into the Luò.\n\nTwenty *li* northeast rises Shēng Mountain. Its trees include oak, *gǔ*, and thorns; its grasses, *shǔyǔ*, *huì*, and other fragrant herbs.\n\nTen *li* farther east stands a mountain abundant in *kòutuō* grass. This herb grows in the southern lands, reaching a height of over a zhang, its leaves resembling those of the lotus, its stem filled with pith of pure white. The fairest of women cultivate and irrigate it daily, treating it as a tree. The Yellow-Acid River flows from here, northward into the Hé. Within its waters lie many *xuán*-jade, stones second only to true jade. Master Xun said: *\"Xuan-yao pearls remain unstrung.\"* (Pronounced *xuán*.)\n\nTwelve *li* farther east rises Yángxū Mountain, rich in metal and overlooking the Xuánhù Waters. The *River Chart* states: *\"When Cang Jie accompanied the Emperor on his southern inspection tour, he ascended Yángxū Mountain and gazed upon the confluence of the Xuánhù and Luò Rivers. A divine turtle emerged from these waters, bearing upon its shell red and green characters, which it bestowed upon him.\"*\n\nFrom the first mountain of the Bó range, Gǒulín Mountain, to Yángxū Mountain, there are in total sixteen mountains spanning two thousand nine hundred and eighty-two *li*. Shēng Mountain is the burial mound of the range; its sacrificial rites require a grand offering of the finest jade. The first mountain of the range is its head; its sacrifices involve black millet, a black sacrificial victim, and a grand offering of *niè*-fermented ale (ale brewed with *niè*-malt). For the dance, a thousand mouths perform the myriad dances, drums set in place and struck to accompany the movements. The offering requires a single jade disc.\n\nThe Shī River unites Heaven and Earth, serving as the conduit for celestial spirits. A fattened sacrificial victim is offered: a black dog above, a hen below, a ewe slit open, and blood presented in libation. (To *cì* is to cut open.) As the *Rites of Zhou* states: *\"The *cì*-officiant presents the canine sacrifice.\"* The offering requires fine jade, adorned with silk and further embellished with colored silks. The feast is held to encourage and strengthen the spirits.\n\nThe *Rites of the Special Sacrificial Victim and the Offering of Food* states: \"To hold the libation vessel is the act of the invocator offering the feast.\"\n\nThe *Central Mountains: Sixth Section* records: The first mountain of the Gǎodī range is called Píngféng Mountain. To its south lie the Yī and Luò Rivers; to its east, the Gǔchéng Mountains, situated west of Jìběi’s Gǔchéng County. The Yellow Stone Elder’s stone rests beneath this mountain, where Zhang Liang retrieved it for burial. The mountain bears no grass or trees, no water, only abundant sand and stone. There dwells a spirit whose form resembles a human with two heads, named *Jiāochóng*. It is the stinging insect, chief of all stinging creatures, and the very hive of bees and honey. This refers to the gathering place of swarms, for *mì* (honey) is also the name of the bee. For its sacrifice, a single rooster is used, offered in exorcism but not killed. *Ráng* is also a name for sacrifice, meaning to ward off malign qi.\n\nTen *li* to the west lies Gǎodī Mountain. It has no grass or trees but abounds in metal and jade. Another ten *li* west stands Guī Mountain (pronounced like *xiāng* in *xiāngkǒu*). Its northern slopes yield *fú*-jade. To its west lies a valley called Guàn Gorge, where many willows and paper mulberries grow. Within it dwells a bird resembling a pheasant with a long tail, red as cinnabar flame and with a blue beak, named *líng* (pronounced *líng* or *yāo*). Its call is its own name, and wearing it prevents nightmares.\n\nJiāoshāng’s waters issue from its southern slopes, flowing south into the Luò River. Yúsuí’s waters emerge from its northern slopes, flowing north into the Gǔ River. Thirty *li* farther west stands Zhānzhū Mountain. Its southern slopes yield metal; its northern slopes, patterned stone. The Xiè River (pronounced *xiè*) rises here, flowing southeast into the Luò. The Shǎo River emerges from its northern slopes, flowing east into the Gǔ River.\n\nThirty *li* west lies Lóuzhuó Mountain. It has no grass or trees but abounds in metal and jade. The Zhān River rises on its southern slopes, flowing east into the Luò. The Bēi River emerges from its northern slopes, known in the world as the Bǎidá River, flowing north into the Gǔ. Within it lie many purple and patterned stones.\n\nForty *li* west stands Báishí Mountain. The Huì River rises on its southern slopes, flowing south into the Luò, and abounds in water-jade. The Jiàn River emerges from its northern slopes—*The Book [of Documents]* states: \"The Yī, Luò, Chán, and Jiàn\"—flowing northwest into the Gǔ. Within it lie many *mí*-stones and *lúdān* (furnace cinnabar), both of unknown nature.\n\nFifty *li* west lies Gǔ Mountain. Its heights abound in grain; its lower slopes, in mulberries. The Shuǎng River rises here, known in the world as Zhùmá Gorge, flowing northwest into the Gǔ. Within it lies much *bìlǜ* (green jasper).\n\nSeventy-two *li* west stands Mì Mountain. (Today, Mì County in Xíngyáng also has a Mì Mountain, but this is likely not the same.) Its southern slopes yield jade; its northern slopes, iron. The Háo River rises here, flowing south into the Luò. Within it dwell many *xuán* turtles, whose forms have raven heads and turtle tails, and whose cries resemble the splitting of wood. It has no grass or trees.\n\nA hundred *li* west stands Chángshí Mountain. It has no grass or trees but abounds in metal and jade. To its west lies a valley called Gòng Gorge, where many bamboos grow. The Gòng River rises here, flowing southwest into the Luò. Within it lie many *míng* stones. In the first year of the *Yǒngkāng* reign of Jìn, Xiāngyáng Commandery presented a *míng* stone, resembling jade in color, whose ringing sound carried seven or eight *li*. Today, in Quánlíng County of Línglíng in Língzhōu, there are two *míng* stones, one shaped like a drum, hence its popular name, \"Stone Drum.\" These belong to the same type.\n\nA hundred and forty *li* west stands Fù Mountain. It has no grass or trees but abounds in *yáobì* (precious jade). The Yànrǎn River rises on its southern slopes, flowing south into the Luò. Within it dwell many *rényú* (human-fish). To its west lies a forest called Pānzhǒng (pronounced *fān*). The Gǔ River rises here, flowing east into the Luò. (Today, the Gǔ River rises in Gǔyáng Valley, flowing northeast through Gǔchéng County into the Luò.) Within it lies much *yān* jade, though its nature remains unknown. *Yān* is pronounced *yīn*.\n\nFurther west fifty *li* stands Qì Mountain. Its trees abound in *chū* (ailanthus), and many □ trees. Today in Shǔ, there are □ trees: in the seventh and eighth months, they put forth ears, and when the ears form, they appear as if dusted with salt powder, suitable for vinegar broth. Pronounced *bèi*. Its southern slopes yield much gold and jade; its northern slopes, much iron and *xiāo* (mugwort). *Xiāo* is *hāo* (wormwood). See the *Ěryǎ*. The Tuó River rises here, flowing north into the Yellow River. Within it dwell many *xiūpì* fish, shaped like □□, a kind of frog. They have white beaks, their cries resemble an owl’s, and eating them cures white *xiǎn* (tinea).\n\nNinety *li* further west stands Chángzhēng Mountain. It has no grass or trees but abounds in *è* (chalk). The Qí River rises here, pronounced *qiáo*, flowing northeast into the Yellow River. Within it lies much *cāng* jade. The Zī River also rises here, flowing north into the Yellow River.\n\nNinety *li* further west stands Kuāfù Mountain. Its trees abound in □ and *nán* (nanmu); its bamboo, in *jiàn* (arrow bamboo). Its beasts include many □ cattle and *xián* sheep; its birds, many red *bì* (pheasants). Its southern slopes yield much jade; its northern slopes, much iron. To its north lies a forest called Táolín, spanning three hundred *li* in breadth. Within it dwell many horses. Today, Táolín is in the southern valley of Quēxiāng in Hóngnóng’s Hú County, rich in wild horses, mountain goats, and mountain cattle. The Hú River rises here, flowing north into the Yellow River, and within it lies much *yān* jade.\n\nNinety *li* further west stands Yánghuá Mountain. Its southern slopes yield much gold and jade; its northern slopes, much *qīng xiónghuáng* (green realgar). Its grasses include many *shǔyǔ* and *kǔshēn*, the latter resembling *sù* (willow) in form—this is the *jiū* character. Its fruit resembles a melon, its taste sour-sweet, and eating it cures malaria. The Yáng River rises here, flowing southwest into the Luò. Within it dwell many *rényú* (human-fish). The Mén River also rises here, flowing northeast into the Yellow River. Within it lies much *xuán*□, black whetstone born in the water. The Jiégū River rises on its northern slopes, pronounced *jiè*, flowing east into the Mén River. Its heights yield much copper. The Mén River, upon reaching the Yellow River, flows one hundred ninety *li* into the Luò.\n\nIn all, the peaks of Gǎodī Mountain range from Píngféng Mountain to Yánghuá Mountain, comprising fourteen mountains over seven hundred ninety *li*. The sacred peak lies among them; it is sacrificed to in the sixth month, the middle of the year. Following the sacrificial rites of the other sacred peaks, the realm will know peace.\n\nThe first peak of the *Zhōng Cì Qī Jīng* (Central Seventh Classic), Kǔ Mountain, is called Xiūyǔ Mountain. Variant: *Yú* (舆). Its summit bears a stone named the Emperor’s Terrace Chess, for Dìtái, a divine being. *Chess* refers to *bóqí* (a board game). It is five-colored and patterned, resembling a quail’s egg. The Emperor’s Terrace Stone is used to pray to the hundred spirits. In sacrificial rites, this stone is employed for the hundred spirits. Wearing it prevents *gǔ* (possession sickness).\n\nThere is a grass here resembling *shī* (yarrow), with red leaves and a clumping base, called *sùtiáo*. It can be made into *gǎn* (arrow shafts). Three hundred *li* east stands Gǔzhōng Mountain, where Dìtái feasts the hundred spirits. Celebratory banquets are held on this mountain, hence its name, Gǔzhōng (Drum and Bell) Mountain. There is a grass here with square stems and yellow leaves, round leaves arranged in three layers, called *niǎosuān*. It can be used to make poison or medicine. Its heights abound in *lì* (whetstone); its depths, in *dǐ* (fine whetstone).\n\nTwo hundred *li* further east stands Gūyáo Mountain.\n\nThe name is pronounced *Yáo*, and some omit the character *shān* (mountain).

Used for washing clothes, it removes grime. Its pit is hard, straight, and black, and may be threaded into fragrant tassels. It is also called *guālou*. One hundred *li* northwest lies Mount Jinli. Its heights are rich in pines and cypresses, as well as fine catalpa and nanmu. Its northern slopes yield cinnabar *zhu* and abundant gold. Its beasts are mostly leopards and tigers. A bird dwells here, resembling a magpie with a blue-green body, white beak, white eyes, and white tail, called the *qinggeng*. It may be used to guard against pestilence, and its call echoes its name. Thirty *li* southeast stands Mount Yigu. (Pronounced *ku*.) Its summit abounds in *niu* and oak, as well as *ju*—the latter’s nature remains undetermined. (Pronounced *zu*.) A beast resides here, resembling a dog with tiger claws and armored scales, called the *lin*. (Its body bears both fur and scales; pronounced *lin*.) It excels at leaping and bounding, flinging itself about. (Pronounced *yang* or *fen*.) Those who consume its flesh are not afflicted by wind, nor do they fear the gales of heaven.\n\nThirty-five *li* southeast stands Mount Jigu. It yields fine jade and many dark leopards—black leopards, that is, for the mountains of present-day Jingzhou produce black tigers. It abounds in *lüchen* and *ling* deer. Its southern slopes yield *min* stone, while its northern slopes yield green *qing* stone.\n\nForty *li* southeast stands Mount Jishan. Its summit abounds in fine catalpa and mulberry, and its grasses are mostly wild leeks.\n\nFifty *li* southeast stands Mount Gaoqian. A spring rises upon its summit, so cold and clear that it seems to vanish underground. It is the nectar of the Terrace of the Thearch. Today, on Mount Tanshou south of Jie County in Hedong, a spring emerges and pools without flowing—commonly called \"vat nectar\"—of the same kind. Those who drink of it are spared heart pain. Its summit yields gold, and its base yields ochre.\n\nThirty *li* southeast stands Mount Youxi. It abounds in *niu*, oak, and grain; in jade; and in *feng* stone.\n\nThirty-five *li* southeast stands Mount Cong. Its summit abounds in pine and cypress, and its base in bamboo. The Cong River rises upon its summit and vanishes beneath its slopes. Within its waters dwell many three-legged turtles with branching tails—known as *zhi* turtles, as recorded in the *Erya*. Those who consume their flesh are spared from pestilence.\n\nThirty *li* southeast stands Mount Yingzhen. Its summit abounds in pine and cypress, and its base in catalpa and *xun* wood.\n\nThirty *li* southeast stands Mount Bishan. The waters of the Thearch’s Park rise here and flow northeast into the Shi River. Within them dwell many water jades and many dragons. Its summit abounds in *fufu* jade.\n\nTwenty *li* southeast stands Mount Lema. A beast dwells here, resembling a *hui* with fur red as cinnabar flame, called the *li*. Where it appears, the land suffers great pestilence.\n\nTwenty-five *li* southeast stands Mount Zhenshan. The Shi River rises here—some say *Shi* should be read as *Chen*. The Qin River of today lies in Nanyang, flowing southeast into the Ru River. Within its waters dwell many *renyu* (human-fish), many dragons, and many *xie*—creatures resembling green dogs.\n\nForty *li* east stands Mount Yingshan. Its base abounds in green *qing* stone, and its summit in gold and jade.\n\nThirty *li* east stands Mount Hushou.

The Lun River rises here, flowing southeast into the Shi River. Within its waters dwell many dragons. At its summit stands a mulberry tree, fifty *chi* in height, five *zhang* in girth. Its branches spread in four directions, meaning they extend outward in intersecting paths. Its leaves measure over a *chi* in length, with red veins, yellow blossoms, and green calyxes—called the Mulberry of the Emperor’s Daughter. The mouth governs silkworms; the mouth names it.\n\nForty-five *li* east stands Mount Hengshan. Today’s Hengshan lies in Hengyang, south of Xiangnan County—the Southern Marchmount. Now called Mount Xunlu. Its summit abounds in green *qing* stone and mulberry trees; its birds are mostly mynas.\n\nForty *li* east stands Mount Fengshan.

(This mountain was mentioned earlier; it may share the same name.) Its southern slopes abound in red gold, and its northern slopes in whetstone.\n\nTen *li* east stands Mount Zhongjiushan. It bears no grasses or trees.\n\nSeventy *li* northeast stands Mount Lishi, also called Mount Moshi. Its trees are mostly thorns and *qi*. Its southern slopes abound in yellow gold, and its northern slopes in whetstone. A beast dwells here, resembling a leopard but with a white head and tiger claws—called *liangqu*. Where it appears, the land faces great warfare.\n\nOne hundred *li* southeast stands Mount Qiushan. The Qiu River rises at its summit and flows underground at its base.

A beast dwells here, resembling a pig, with a yellow body, white head, and white tail—called *wenlin*, pronounced *lin*. Where it appears, the land faces great winds. *Lin* is also written as *kou*, pronounced *kou*.\n\nThe total range of the Keshan mountains, from Mount Yiwang to Mount Jishan, comprises forty-eight mountains spanning three thousand seven hundred thirty-two *li*. Their spirits all take the form of swine-bodied, human-headed beings. For their sacrifices: one rooster is offered in prayer, one *gui* jade tablet is buried, and five kinds of grain are used as *xu*. Qiu Mountain is the abode of an emperor; its sacrifices require the full *tailao* ritual implements, with offerings buried and the sacrificial animal’s hair inverted. One *bi* jade disc is used, and the ox has no fixed standard. Mount Du and Mount Yu are tombs; all sacrifices there are inverted, with *shaolao* offerings of hair and *ji* jade.\n\nThe *Zhong Ci Twelve Classics* begins with the Dongting mountains, starting at Mount Pianyu (or Mount Jian). It bears no grasses or trees but abounds in yellow gold. Fifty *li* southeast stands Mount Yunshan. It has no grasses or trees but grows *jue* bamboo, which is highly poisonous—any injury from it is fatal. In present-day Guiyang County of Shixing Prefecture, *sheng* bamboo grows, with the largest reaching two *chi* in circumference and four *zhang* in length. In Jiaozhi, there is also *di* bamboo, hollow and exceptionally strong, its poison capable of piercing tigers to kill them. This is of the same kind. Its summit abounds in yellow gold, and its base holds much *fufu* jade.\n\nFurther southeast one hundred and thirty *li* stands Mount Gui. Its trees abound in *gu*, oak, *chou*, and *ju*. Its summit holds much yellow gold, its base much green realgar, and many *fu* bamboo—*qiong* bamboo, that is. Tall of node and solid within, it serves as a staff, hence called \"elder-supporting bamboo.\"\n\nSeventy *li* east lies Mount Bing. It abounds in *jue* bamboo, yellow gold, copper, and iron, but has no trees. Fifty *li* southeast stands Mount Fengbo. Its summit holds much gold and jade, its base many *suan* stones and patterned stones—*suan* stones remain undetermined in meaning. It abounds in iron, and its trees are mostly willow, *niu*, sandalwood, and paper mulberry. To its east lies a forest named Mangfu, rich in fine trees and birds and beasts.\n\nOne hundred and fifty *li* east stands Mount Fufu. Its summit holds much yellow gold, its base much green realgar. Its trees are mostly mulberry and paper mulberry, its grasses mostly bamboo. The spirit Jigu resides here, human in form but wielding two serpents, often roaming the depths of the Yangtze, emerging and entering with radiance.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* southeast lies Mount Dongting. Today, west of Yiling County in Changsha, there is also a Dongting embankment, submerged and connected to the Yangtze. The *Li Sao* says: \"I turned my way by Dongting, / Where waves rose and leaves fell.\" Both refer to this place. The character is sometimes written as *tong* (copper), but the water radical is more fitting. Its summit holds much yellow gold, its base much silver and iron. Its trees abound in wild plums, pears, tangerines, and pomelos; its grasses abound in orchids, *miwu*, peonies, and *xiongqiong*. *Miwu* resembles *shechuang* but is fragrant.\n\nThe two daughters of the Celestial Thearch reside here, divine beings of the Yangtze. These are the two Jiang consorts of the *Liexian Zhuan*. The \"Xiang Lady\" of the *Li Sao*’s *Nine Songs*, addressed as \"Imperial Child,\" refers to them. Yet the *Hetu Yuban* states: \"The Xiang Lady was the daughter of Emperor Yao.\" When the First Emperor of Qin sailed the Yangtze to Xiang Mountain and encountered a great storm, he asked his scholars: \"What god is the Xiang Lord?\" The scholars replied: \"We have heard they were Yao’s two daughters and Shun’s consorts, who died and were buried here.\" The *Lienü Zhuan* says: \"The two women died between the Jiang and Xiang rivers, and the custom calls them the Xiang Lord.\" Zheng Sinong also took Shun’s consorts to be the Xiang Lord. Commentators all claim that when Shun died on his southern tour, his two consorts followed and drowned together in the Xiang River, hence their title as the Xiang Ladies.\n\nYet in the *Nine Songs*, the Xiang Lord and Xiang Lady are distinct deities. The presence of a Lady in the Jiang and Xiang is like the consorts of the Yellow and Luo Rivers. Their numinosity is coeval with heaven and earth—how could they be called Yao’s daughters? And if they were Yao’s daughters, how could they collectively be called the Xiang Lord? To verify this: the *Record of Rites* states: \"Shun was buried in Cangwu, and his two consorts did not follow.\" Clearly, the two consorts did not accompany him in life or death; the principle is evident. Even if they had followed, the two women’s divine insight and boundless perception could have saved them from the crisis of the well and granary with bird-work and dragon robes—how could they not have escaped the wind and waves to suffer a double drowning?\n\nIf this were so, the *Tradition* says: \"In life, they were high ministers; in death, noble spirits. Their rites equaled the Five Marshes and rivaled the Three Dukes, the Four Seas and the feudal lords.\" Yet the Xiang River does not rank among the Four Waterways, nor is it listed in the mandated sacrifices. As descendants of an emperor, how could the two women’s divine essence descend to a minor river as mere ladies? Comparing the accounts, the meanings are jumbled; weaving the principles, no basis remains. This cannot be so.\n\nThe root of the error lies in conflating the title \"imperial daughter,\" confusing name and reality. No one corrected the mistake, and falsehood prevailed over truth, persisting unrecognized through the ages—how lamentable! They often roam the depths of the Yangtze. The winds of the Li and Yuan rivers mingle in the abyss of Xiao and Xiang. The *Sa* verse says the two women play in the river’s abyssal palace, where they can stir the Three Jiang and harmonize the winds and waves, expressing their numinous power.\n\nThe Yangtze, Xiang, and Yuan rivers all converge at the head of Baling, hence called the Mouth of the Three Jiang. The Li River joins them seventy or eighty *li* further on. The *Huainanzi* says: \"Fowling and fishing on the Xiao and Xiang.\" Their present location remains unclear. *Xiao* is pronounced *xiao*. This lies between the Nine Jiang. The *Geographical Records* state: \"The Nine Jiang are now south of Xunyang.\" The Yangtze divides into nine branches, all flowing east to join the great river. The *Book* says: \"The Nine Jiang are most vast.\" This is it.\n\nTheir comings and goings are always with whirlwinds and violent storms.\n\nHere the land teems with uncanny spirits—shaped like humans yet bearing serpents, each hand clutching a snake. Strange birds abound as well.\n\nOne hundred and eighty *li* to the southeast lies Mount Bao. Its forests are thick with □, nanmu, thorn, *qi*, arrow bamboo, □, and *jun*—all varieties of fine bamboo. The \"Arrow\" bamboo is noted in the *Tribute of Yu*. The mountain’s heights yield gold and jade, its depths abound in quartz, striped stone, and iron. Its beasts are mostly elk, river deer, and *jiu*—the *jiu* being the osprey, as recorded in the *Guangya*.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the southeast stands Mount Jigong. Its heights are rich in gold, its depths in *fufu* jade. Its woods thrive with willow, *niu*, sandalwood, and mulberry. There dwells a creature named *gui*, shaped like a tortoise yet white-bodied, with a crimson head. Its name is pronounced *gui*. It can ward off fire.\n\nOne hundred and fifty-nine *li* to the southeast rises Mount Yao. Its northern slopes bear yellow ochre, its southern gold. Its forests grow thorn, *qi*, willow, and sandalwood, while its grasses include *shuyu* and □.\n\nOne *shi* to the southeast lies Mount Jiangfu. Its heights yield silver and whetstone, though no patterned timber grows there. Its beasts are mostly swine and deer.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the east stands Mount Zhenling. Its heights abound in gold, its depths in jade. Its woods grow millet, oak, willow, and *niu*, while its grasses include *rong* grass.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* to the southeast rises Mount Yangdi. It holds fine copper. Its forests grow sandalwood, *niu*, paper mulberry, and *yan*—the *yan* being mountain mulberry. Its beasts are mostly antelope and musk deer.\n\nNinety *li* to the south lies Mount Chaisang—now the southern part of Chaisang County in Xunyang, connected to Mount Ting. Its heights yield silver, its depths jade and malachite, along with cold stone and ochre. Its woods grow willow, *qi*, paper mulberry, and mulberry, while its beasts are mostly elk and deer. White serpents and flying serpents—those that soar by gathering mist—abound here.\n\nTwo hundred and thirty *li* to the southeast stands Mount Rongyu. Its heights yield copper, its depths silver. Its woods grow willow and *qi*, while its creatures include monstrous serpents and strange insects.\n\nFrom the first peak of the Dongting range, Mount Pianyu, to Mount Rongyu, there are fifteen mountains spanning two thousand eight hundred *li*. Their spirits all take the form of birds with dragon heads. For their sacrifices: one rooster and one sow are offered, the latter slit open (the act called *ci*). The sacrificial grain is glutinous millet.\n\nMounts Fufu, Jigong, Yao, and Yangdi are all burial mounds. Their sacrifices involve *siyi*—the display of offerings before burial. Wine is used in prayer, with a lamb as the animal offering, its wool adorned with one auspicious jade.\n\nThe gods of Dongting and Mount Rongyu receive *siyi* sacrifices as well. After the display, offerings are buried as before. Wine is used in prayer, with a grand sacrifice of a bull, and the ritual jades include fifteen *gui* and *bi* discs, adorned with five colors.\n\nThe \"Central Mountains\" section of the *Classic of Mountains* records a total of one hundred ninety-seven mountains spanning twenty-one thousand three hundred seventy-one *li*.\n\nIn all, the world’s renowned mountains number five thousand three hundred seventy, covering sixty-four thousand fifty-six *li*—this is the extent of the land. Yu said: \"The world’s famed mountains total five thousand three hundred seventy, spanning sixty-four thousand fifty-six *li*, encompassing the earth.\" He spoke of the Five Treasuries, noting that the remaining lesser peaks were too numerous to record.\n\nThe earth spans twenty-eight thousand *li* from east to west and twenty-six thousand *li* from north to south. Mountains that give rise to rivers measure eight thousand *li*, while those that receive waters measure the same. Copper-bearing mountains number four hundred sixty-seven, iron-bearing mountains three thousand six hundred ninety. These are the lands where heaven and earth apportion soil and cultivate grain, where spears and halberds are forged, where blades and swords arise. The skilled have abundance, the unskilled want. Sacrifices at Mount Tai and Liangfu—seventy-two dynasties—hold the tally of gains and losses within them. This is called the wealth of the state. The *Guanzi: Earth Numbers* states: \"Seventy-two rulers have performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices.\"\n\nThe five volumes of the *Classic of Mountains* total fifteen thousand five hundred three characters.\n\n**Peach Grove**\nThe Peach Grove Valley is a true frontier wilderness.\nWhen King Wu conquered Shang, he rested his oxen and let his horses roam.\nBarred were the Three Perils, securing the west for Xia.\n\n**Resonant Stone**\nMetal and stone share a kind—hidden echoes lie within.\nStruck, they roar like thunder, their sound heard afar.\nIf one’s calculations align, qi flows without obstruction.\n\n**Spiral Turtle and Human Fish**\nA sound like splintering wood—this is the spiral turtle.\nIts long neck sways, its cry like an owl’s.\nThe human fish resembles □, emerging from the Luo and Yi rivers.\n\n**Emperor’s Terrace Chess**\nVast is the Emperor’s Terrace, the treasure of the numinous.\nHere lies a stone chessboard, its five colors radiant.\nLibations and prayers to the hundred spirits harmonize heaven’s qi.\n\n**Rue Flower and Sour Grass**\nThe fever-curing herb bears fruit like a melon.\nThe sour grass’s leaves, thrice transformed, bloom yellow.\nIt can be used as poison, fearing neither vipers nor serpents.\n\n**□ Grass**\nThe □ grass’s yellow blossoms resemble dodder.\nThe noble wear it, and people find it charming.\nTransformed from the Emperor’s daughter, its nature is hard to fathom.\n\n**Mountain Grease and Yellow Thorn Beast**\nMountain grease resembles a pig, its nature fond of cursing.\nIt feeds on yellow thorn, neither child nor transformation.\nThough lacking chastity, its principle is like one who never marries.\n\n**Three-Legged Turtle**\nCreation is impartial, without bias or favor.\nShort is not too little, long not too much.\nThe *ben* turtle with three legs—how does it differ from the soft-shelled turtle?\n\n**Fine Glory**\nThunder is heaven’s essence, stirring the heart and startling the eye.\nHow to master it?

Commentary.\n\n*The Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Ten: The Southern Lands Beyond the Seas*\n\nThe earth sustains all within the Six Directions—above and below, the four quarters—these are the Six Directions. Within the Four Seas, the sun and moon cast their light, the stars mark their paths, the four seasons order time, and the Great Year governs the cycles. Spirits and numinous beings arise here, their forms strange and varied; some die young, others live long, yet only the sage can fathom their Way.\n\nTruly, unless one exhausts principle and fulfills nature, one cannot trace the origins of their transformations.\n\nFrom the southwest corner to the southeast corner beyond the seas:\n\n*Corner* (陬) means *nook*; pronounced *zōu*.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bound Chests lies to its southwest; its people have bound chests, their breasts protruding like knotted throats.\n\nSouth Mountain stands to its southeast. From this mountain onward, creatures become serpents, and serpents are called fish—thus creatures turn to serpents, and serpents to fish. Another account places South Mountain to the southeast of the Kingdom of Bound Chests.\n\nThe Pair-Winged Birds dwell to its east, their plumage blue and red, resembling wild ducks. Two birds fly wing to wing. Another account places them east of South Mountain.\n\nThe Feathered People’s Kingdom lies to its southeast; its people have elongated heads and bodies covered in feathers. They can fly but not far, reproduce by eggs, and their depictions resemble immortals. Another account places them southeast of the Pair-Winged Birds, describing them as long-cheeked.\n\n*The Divination of Qi* states: \"The Feathered People have bird beaks, red eyes, and white heads.\"\n\nSixteen divine beings, linked arm to arm, serve the Thearch as guardians of the night in these wilds. Their painted forms appear in nocturnal visions. To the east of the Feathered People, their people have small cheeks and red shoulders, the space between their shoulder blades a vivid crimson. All number sixteen. This passage may have been added by later hands.\n\nThe *Bifang* Bird dwells to its east, west of the Blue Waters. It has a human face and a single foot. Another account places it east of the sixteen spirits.\n\nThe Kingdom of Clamorous Heads lies to its south. Its people have human faces, wings, and bird-like legs, and they can catch fish. *Huandou*, a minister of Yao, committed a crime and cast himself into the southern sea to die. The Thearch pitied him and commanded his descendants to dwell by the southern sea and offer him sacrifices. Their depictions also resemble immortals. Another account places them east of the *Bifang* Bird. Some call it the Kingdom of Clamorous Vermilion.\n\nThe Kingdom of Fire-Suppression lies to its south. Its inhabitants have the bodies of beasts and are black in color, spouting fire from their mouths. It is said they can exhale flames, and their depictions resemble black macaques. Another account places it east of the Kingdom of Clamorous Vermilion.\n\nThe Three Mulberry Trees stand to the north of Fire-Suppression, growing by the Red Waters. These trees have leaves like cypress, all bearing pearls. Another account describes them as resembling comets, with the appearance of a comet’s tail.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Three Miao lies east of the Red Waters. Its people follow one another in succession. In ancient times, when Yao abdicated the realm to Shun, he consulted the lord of the Miao, who disapproved. The Thearch executed him, and the people of the Miao rebelled, fleeing into the southern sea to become the Kingdom of the Three Miao. Another name for it is the Kingdom of the Three Mao.\n\nThe Kingdom of Zhi lies to its east (pronounced *zhi* or *ti*). Its people are yellow and skilled at drawing bows to shoot serpents. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states that this kingdom naturally possesses five kinds of garments. Another account places the Kingdom of Zhi east of the Three Mao.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pierced Chests lies to its east. Its people have holes in their chests. The *Master Shi* says: Among the western barbarians, there are those with pierced chests, deep-set eyes, or long arms—all drawn by the virtue of the Yellow Thearch. The *Record of Strange Things* states: In the land of pierced chests, when their garments are removed, no natural openings remain. This seems to imitate the people of Pierced Chests. Another account places it east of the Kingdom of Dai.\n\nThe Kingdom of Crossed Shins lies to its east. Its people have crossed shins. Their legs and shins twist and intertwine—these are the so-called \"tattooed foreheads\" and \"crossed toes.\" Some write it as \"crossed necks,\" describing people who walk with their necks entwined. Another account places it east of the Kingdom of Pierced Chests.\n\nThe People of Immortality dwell to its east. They are black in color and do not die of old age. There is a Round Hill Mountain, upon which grows the Tree of Immortality; eating its fruit grants longevity. There is also a Red Spring, and drinking its waters prevents aging. Another account places them east of the Kingdom of Pierced Chests.\n\nThe Kingdom of Forked Tongues lies to its east. Its people all have forked tongues, also called \"branched tongues.\" Another account places it east of the People of Immortality.\n\nThe Kunlun Mound lies to its east, a square foundation at the mountain’s base. Another account places it east of the Kingdom of Forked Tongues, describing it as a square mound.\n\nYi battled the Chisel-Tooth at the wilds of Shouhua, where Yi shot and killed him. This took place east of the Kunlun Mound. Yi wielded bow and arrows, while Chisel-Tooth held a shield. Chisel-Tooth was also human, with teeth like chisels, five or six *chi* in length, hence his name. Another name is *Ge*. The details remain unclear.\n\nThe Kingdom of Three Heads lies to its east, where each person has one body but no voice. Another account places it east of Chisel-Tooth.\n\nThe Kingdom of Zhourao lies to its east, where the people are short in stature but wear caps and belts. Their horses stand three *chi* tall, dwell in caves, and are skilled in craftsmanship, possessing five distinct abilities. Another account places the Kingdom of Jiaoyao east of the Kingdom of Three Heads. The *Waizhuan* states: \"The people of Jiaoyao are three *chi* tall, the shortest of all.\" The *Shi Han Shenwu* says: \"Four hundred thousand *li* east of the Central Plains, one finds the people of Jiaoyao, one *chi* and five *cun* in height.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Long Arms lies to its east, where the people catch fish in the water, each hand holding a fish. An old account says their hands hang down to the ground. During the Huangchu era of the Wei, Governor Wang Xu of Xuantu pursued the palace of the King of Goguryeo to its end. Passing through the Kingdom of Wooju, its eastern border reached the great sea, near where the sun rises. He asked the elders: \"Are there people beyond the sea?\" They replied that once, in the sea, they found a cloth garment, its body like that of a middle-sized person, with sleeves three *chi* long—this was the clothing of the Long-Armed people. Another account places it east of Jiaoyao, where they catch fish in the sea.\n\nMount Di: Emperor Yao was buried on its sunny side. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* says: \"Yao was buried in Gulin.\" Today, in the western part of Yangcheng County, near the city of Dong’e County, and south of Xiangting in Zheyang County, there are all said to be Yao’s tombs. Emperor Ku was buried on its shady side. Ku, Yao’s father, was called Gaoxin; his tomb now lies in the Kuaiyin wilds south of Dunqiu County. *Ku* is pronounced like *kù*. There are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, and leopard-like tigers. The *Shizi* says: \"Zhonghuang Boyu, with his left hand, seized a great ape of the Taihang Mountains, and with his right, grappled a leopard-like tiger.\" *Wei* are a kind of macaque. *Lizhu* is the name of a tree; see the *Zhuangzi*. Modern illustrations depict it as a red crow. *Shirou* (\"seeing flesh\") and *jurou* (\"gathering flesh\") resemble ox liver, with two eyes. They can be eaten endlessly, for as soon as they are consumed, they regenerate as before. *Xuyan* and *suozhi* are unclear. King Wen buried them all in their respective places. Today, King Wen’s tomb lies in the eastern altar of Hao in Chang’an. According to the records, the tombs of the kings all have fixed locations, yet the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* often repeats them. This is because the sages ruled for long periods, their benevolence spreading widely, their kindness extending even to birds and beasts. When they passed away, the Four Seas mourned as if they had lost their parents, and there was no grief unexpressed. Thus, people from distant lands and foreign customs, upon hearing of the Son of Heaven’s death, would sit and offer sacrifices, weeping and wailing, and raise mounds of earth as tombs. This is why such tombs appear in many places. It is like the temples of the Son of Heaven found in all the distant commanderies and kingdoms of the Han—this is their legacy. Another account calls it Mount Tang. Another says there are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, *wei*, leopards, *lizhu*, *□jiu*, *□jiu*, and creatures like owls. *Shirou*, *hujiao*, and *suozhi* remain unclear. Its Fan Forest spans three hundred *li*, meaning its trees spread and flourish abundantly.\n\n**Illustrations and Eulogies from the *Haiwai Nanjing***\n\nFrom this mountain, insects become snakes, and snakes are called fish.\nThe base has no fixed tribute; the noble have no constant treasures.\nThings do not define themselves—self-definition comes from man.\nAll matters are thus; how could it be only scales and fins?\n\n**Kingdom of Feathered People**\nWith beaks like birds and long cheeks, they hatch from eggs.\nThey soar on wings, but their dragon-like flight does not carry them far.\nThey belong to the naked kind—how strange their form!\n\n**Divine People of Two Eights**\nEast of the Feathered People, there are spirits who govern the night.\nTwo eights link arms, harnessing themselves.\nBy day they hide; by night they emerge, transforming with the strange hours.\n\n**Kingdom of Huantou**\nThe people of Huan have beaks like birds and walk with feathered staffs.\nThey dwell by the sea, feeding on □*ju*.\nTruly fine grain, the so-called glutinous millet.\n\n**Kingdom of Yanhuo**\nPeople with beastly bodies, their forms strange and cunning.\nThey exhale and inhale fiery essence, flames following their breath’s intensity.\nThough it seems unremarkable, in principle, it cannot be hot.\n\n**Three Pearl Tree**\nWhere the three pearls grow, by the banks of the Red Waters.\nIts leaves stand tall like cypress, its beauty and strength like a comet.\nBathed in crimson waves, they reflect each other like rosy clouds.\n\n**Kingdom of Zhie**\nThey do not cultivate silkworms or weave silk, nor do they sow or reap.\nA hundred beasts lead the dance; flocks of birds clap their wings.\nThese are called the people of Zhie, naturally clothed and fed.\n\n**Kingdoms of Pierced Chests, Crossed Legs, and Forked Tongues**\nA great furnace melts metal, casting myriad forms.\nCreation is impartial, each endowed with its nature.\nReturning to the bending and shaping, one sees the signs of destiny.\n\n**Kingdom of Immortality**\nPeople dwell here on Yuanqiu.\nThe Red Springs halt aging; the divine tree nurtures life.\nObserve this distant longevity—endless and boundless.\n\n**Chisel-Tooth**\nChisel-Tooth was human, with extraordinary teeth.\nFiercer than Jiuying, more harmful than the long serpent.\nYao commanded Yi to slay him at Shouhua.\n\n**Kingdom of Three Heads**\nThough they share one *qi*, their breaths follow different paths.\n\nBeholding, all are seen; eating, all are sated.\nForms complete themselves—creation is no artifice.\n\n**Kingdom of the Diminutive**\nA thousand pipes blow discordant notes, each *qi* distinct in myriad ways.\nGiants stand three *zhang* tall; the diminutive barely a *chi*.\nYet in the great confluence, even this is but a passing semblance.\n\n**Kingdom of Long Arms**\nTheir arms stretch three *chi* long, though their bodies match common folk.\nWhat are they?

The dance was a grand spectacle of whirling motion. He rode two dragons, his cloud-canopy layered thrice. In his left hand, he held a feathered banner; in his right, a jade ring—crafted from hollowed nephrite. A jade *huang* hung at his waist, the *huang* being a half-disc of jade. This took place north of Dayun Mountain.\n\nThe *Gui Zang Zheng Mu Jing* states: *\"When Xia Hou Qi divined, he rode a flying dragon to ascend the heavens—auspicious.\"* Thus it is clear Qi, too, was a transcendent.\n\nAnother name for this place is the **Wilds of Great Legacy**. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* calls it the **Wilds of Great Solemnity**.\n\n**The Land of Three Bodies** lies north of Xia Hou Qi, its people bearing one head and three torsos.\n\n**The Land of One Arm** lies to its north, its people possessing one arm, one eye, and one nostril.\n\nThere are **yellow horses** there, striped like tigers, with one eye and one hoof.\n\n**The Land of Extraordinary Skill** (or *Qi*, pronounced *ji*) lies further north. Its people have one arm and three eyes, embodying both yin and yang, and ride patterned steeds—yin above, yang below, the patterned steed being a white horse with dark markings.\n\nA bird dwells nearby, two-headed and of reddish-yellow hue. The people of this land excel in craftsmanship, snaring all manner of fowl. They fashion flying chariots, traveling far on the wind. In the time of Tang, one was found within the borders of Yuzhou; the king had it ground to dust, refusing to show it to others. Ten years later, when the west wind returned, he had another made and sent it away.\n\n**Xingtian** contended with the Thearch for divine authority here. The Thearch severed his head and buried it on **Changyang Mountain**, whereupon Xingtian made eyes of his nipples and a mouth of his navel, brandishing shield and axe in dance—the shield being a buckler, the *qi* a battle-axe. Thus he became the **Headless People**.\n\n**Nü Ji** and **Nü Qi** dwell to their north, between two rivers. Nü Qi holds a fish—of the eel family—while Nü Ji wields a sacrificial platter.\n\nThe **Jing Bird** and the **□ Bird** (pronounced *zhan* or *liang*) follow in their wake, their feathers blue-yellow. Wherever they pass, kingdoms perish. These are birds of plague and calamity, akin to the modern owl and horned owl.\n\nNorth of Nü Ji lies the **Jing Bird**, a man-faced creature dwelling upon mountains. Another name for it is the **Wei Bird**, gathering place of azure birds and yellow crows.\n\n**The Land of Husbandmen** lies north of the Wei Bird. Its people wear robes, caps, and girded swords.\n\nWhen **Emperor Da Wu** of the **Ao Clan** sent **Wang Meng** to gather herbs, he journeyed from the **Queen Mother of the West** to the north, where his path was cut off by impassable roots. He sustained himself on tree fruits and clad himself in bark. Though he lived his life without a wife, two sons were born from his body; when their father died, they became the **People of Husbandmen**.\n\nThe corpse of **Nü Chou** was born and scorched to death by ten suns. North of the Land of Husbandmen, she shields her face with her right hand. The ten suns hover above, while Nü Chou stands upon the mountain.\n\nThe **Land of Wu Xian** lies north of Nü Chou. Its people hold a green serpent in the right hand and a red serpent in the left, dwelling upon **Dengbao Mountain**, where drought shamans ascend and descend. They come and go gathering herbs.\n\n**Bingfeng** resides east of Wu Xian, its form like a boar with heads before and behind, black in color. The modern crossbow-string snake belongs to this kind.\n\nThe **Land of Women** lies north of Wu Xian, where two women dwell, encircled by water. There is a **Yellow Pool**; when women bathe in it, they emerge with child. Should a son be born, he dies at three years of age. *Zhou* means to encircle, as in the *Li Sao*: \"Water encircles the hall below.\" Another account says they dwell within a single gate.\n\nThe **Land of Xuanyuan** lies at the edge of these desolate mountains, where even the short-lived reach eight hundred years. This land rests at the southern border of the mountains, as the *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: \"South of Mount Min.\" It lies north of the Land of Women. Its people have human faces and serpent bodies, their tails entwined above their heads.\n\n**Qiong Mountain** stands to its north. None dare shoot westward, for they revere the **Mound of Xuanyuan**, fearing the majesty of the Yellow Emperor. Thus, they do not dare aim their arrows to the west.\n\nNorth of the Land of Xuanyuan, the mound is square, encircled by four serpents, coiling and twining. This is the **Wilds of Yao**, *yao* pronounced as *wo*. Here, the **Luan Bird** sings of its own accord, and the **Feng Bird** dances spontaneously. The people eat the eggs of the phoenix and drink the sweet dew, their desires fulfilled as they wish. All flavors are present, and every wish is granted—this is what is meant by a fertile wild.\n\nAll beasts gather here in harmony. North of the four serpents, the people hold eggs in both hands to eat, while two birds guide them from the front.\n\nThe **Dragon-Fish**, dwelling upon mounds, lies to the north, its form like a wildcat. Some say the dragon-fish resembles a wildcat with a single horn. Another name is *xia*. Pronounced *xia*.\n\nHere ride the divine and sagely, traversing the Nine Wilds—the wilds of the Nine Regions.\n\nOne is called the **Turtle-Fish**, dwelling north of the Wilds of Yao. Its form resembles a carp. *Turtle* is pronounced *you*.\n\nThe **Land of the White People** lies north of the Dragon-Fish, its inhabitants pale-bodied with unbound hair. Their flesh is said to be translucently white.\n\nThere is the **Chariot-Yellow**, its form like a fox, with a horn upon its back. Whoever rides it gains a lifespan of two thousand years. The *Book of Zhou* states: \"The White People ride the Chariot-Yellow, fox-like, with two horns upon its back—this is the Flying Yellow.\" The *Master Huainan* says: \"When the world follows the Dao, the Flying Yellow rests among the black steeds.\"\n\nThe **Land of Sushen** lies north of the White People, where grows a tree called **Xiongchang** (or **Luochang**). When a new emperor is to succeed the throne, its bark is harvested here. Their custom eschews clothing, but when a sagely emperor arises in the Central Kingdom, this tree yields bark for garments.\n\nThe **Land of the Long-Legged** lies north of Xiongchang, its people with unbound hair. The land is east of the Red Waters, its inhabitants long-armed, their bodies like those of ordinary men, yet their arms span two *zhang*. By analogy, their legs must exceed three *zhang*. They appear in the time of the Yellow Emperor. Some say the long-legged carry the long-armed into the sea to catch fish. Another name is **Long-Jiao**. Some say there is a **Land of Qiao**, and the acrobats’ \"Qiao people\" likely imitate these figures.\n\nIn the west, **Bohu**, the Metal Spirit, has a human face, tiger claws, white fur, and wields iron. A serpent coils from his left ear, and he rides two dragons. As recorded in the *Outer Traditions*.\n\n*(See the* Illustrated Eulogies of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Outer Seas, Western Regions*.)\n\nThe Xia sovereign Qi divined and rode flying dragons, his dance fruiting across nine generations. He wielded the cloud-fused banner, wore jade pendants at his girdle. Facing the Yang Emperor’s virtue, he received Heaven’s numinous instruction.\n\n**Land of Three Bodies, Land of One Arm**\nThe ten thousand things flow into form, scattering primordial chaos. Increase brings no excess, decrease no loss. Their transformations defy tracing—seek rather their root.\n\n**Land of Marvelous Naves**\nWondrous the craft, the people of Marvelous Naves! Harnessing the wind’s intent, they fashioned flying wheels. Ascending ruin’s path, they became guests of Emperor Tang.\n\n**Xingtian**\nContending for divinity and failing, he was slain by the Emperor. Thus his form was severed: navel became mouth, nipples became eyes. Still he brandished shield and axe—though transformed, he did not submit.\n\n**Nüji and Nüqi**\nThose fair maidens—whose daughters were they? Why dwell amid the waters, grasping fish and bearing platters? Where lies their mate? They dwell apart, sundered from the flock.\n\n**Jing Bird and □ Bird**\nThere are birds of blue and yellow, called □□. They gather with omens, assembling wherever summoned. Their kind resembles the owl, yet their form resists charm.\n\n**Land of Husbands**\nYin bears partial transformation, Yang lacks the principle of generation. In the Land of Husbands, Wang and Meng were the first. Moved by numinous communion, the mulberry and stone bore no child.\n\n**Nüchou’s Corpse**\nTen suns scorched in unison, and Nüchou perished. Exposed upon the mountain’s bend, she waved her sleeves to shield herself. That beauty—whose daughter was she? She met Heaven’s calamity.\n\n**Wu Xian**\nOf the ten shamans, Wu Xian was their leader. He scoured the arts of healing, synthesized the techniques of practice. Gathering herbs on the sacred mountain, he ascended and descended with the seasons.\n\n**Bingfeng**\nA dragon without a head, Bingfeng conjoined in tandem. Their forms diverge as a steed split at the spine. Though their nature finds its own way, the more one seeks, the more obscure they become.\n\n**Land of Women**\nJiandi swallowed the egg, Jiang Yuan trod the footprint.\n\n**Land of Women**\nIn the Land of Women, they bathe in the Yellow Waters.\nConceiving, they bear children—\nif a son is born, he dies.\n\n**Land of Xuanyuan**\nThe people of Xuanyuan,\nblessed by Heaven’s favor.\nIn winter, they wear no layered robes;\nin summer, they fan no heat.\nTheir qi harmonious,\neach household lives as long as Pengzu.\n\n**Cheng Huang**\nThe flying yellow steed, rare and swift—\nwho rides it defies old age.\nIts horns light, its leaps soaring,\nsuddenly like a dragon’s twist.\nTruly, it mirrors virtue—\nonly then does it alight early.\n\n**Mie Meng Bird, Great Motion Mountain, and Male Constant Tree**\nAzure-bodied, crimson-tailed,\nit is called the Mie Meng Bird.\nOn Great Motion Mountain,\na hundred *ren* high, triple-tiered.\nThe Male Constant Tree\nresponds to virtue and connects.\n\n**Dragon-Fish**\nThe dragon-fish, one-horned,\nlike a wildcat dwelling on hills.\nAwaiting the time, it emerges—\ndivine sages ride upon it.\nSoaring across the nine realms,\nmounting dragons to ascend.\n\n**Rushou of the West**\nRushou, the Metal Spirit,\nwhite-furred with tiger claws.\nGrasping a serpent and battle-axe,\nhe oversees the lawless.\nEstablished in the Western Reaches,\nhe executes Heaven’s punishment with reverence.\n\n*End of the Seventh Scroll of the Classic of Mountains and Seas*\n*Beginning of the Eighth Scroll of the Classic of Mountains and Seas*\n\n**Guo Pu’s Commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Northern Lands Beyond the Seas***\n\nThe lands beyond the seas extend from the northeast corner to the northwest corner.\n\n**The Land of Wuqiong**\nThe land of Wuqiong—its name pronounced as *Qǐ* (or written as *Qǐng*)—lies east of the Long-Legged People. Its inhabitants lack kidneys (here meaning the intestines). They dwell in caves, consume earth, and know no distinction of male or female. When one dies, they bury the body; the heart does not decay, and after one hundred and twenty years, the dead revive.\n\n**Zhong Mountain’s Deity**\nThe deity of Zhong Mountain is named *Zhu Yin* (also called *Zhu Long*, the Torch Dragon). It illuminates the Nine Yin, hence its name. When it opens its eyes, it is day; when it closes them, it is night. Its breath brings winter; its exhalation, summer. It neither drinks nor eats nor rests; its breath becomes wind (here, *qi* breath). Its body stretches a thousand *li*. To the east of Wuqiong, this being has the face of a human, the body of a serpent, and a crimson hue, dwelling at the foot of Zhong Mountain. The *Huainanzi* states: \"A dragon with one foot.\" The Land of One-Eye lies to its east, where people have a single eye centered in their faces. Another account says they possess hands and feet.\n\n**The Land of Rouli**\nThe Land of Rouli lies east of the One-Eyed People. Its inhabitants have one hand and one foot, with knees bent backward and feet curled upward (one foot and one hand, twisted and inverted). Another version calls it the Land of Liuliu, where people’s feet fold backward.\n\n**Xiangliu, Minister of Gonggong**\nXiangliu was a minister of Gonggong (the usurper who seized the Nine Provinces). It had nine heads, each devouring the creatures of a different mountain—an image of insatiable greed and violence. Where Xiangliu pressed its body, marshes and streams formed (*dǐ* means \"to touch\"; *jué* means \"to dig\"). Pronounced *jué*.\n\nYu slew Xiangliu, but its blood reeked so foully that no five grains could be sown in the tainted soil. Yu dug deep into the earth, excavating three times to a depth of three *ren*, yet the blood still seeped upward, saturating the land with its greasy foulness. Thus, he raised the Terrace of the Many Sovereigns upon it—a place where the sodden earth could only bear piled soil for a platform. This terrace lies north of Kunlun (the Kunlun beyond the seas) and east of the Land of Rouli.\n\nXiangliu had nine human-faced heads, a serpent’s body, and was blue in hue. None dared shoot arrows northward, for they feared the Terrace of Gonggong, which stood to its east. The terrace was square, with a serpent at each corner—tiger-striped, their heads all facing south.\n\nEast of the terrace lies the Land of Deep Eyes, where people raise one hand to shield a single eye. Another version calls it the Land of *Yi*. It is said to be near Gonggong’s [missing text].\n\nEast (or south, in another version) of the Land of Deep Eyes lies the Land of the Gutless, where people are tall but lack intestines—all they consume passes straight through. Further east is the Land of Clasping Ears, where tigers bring rain in patterns, and its people’s ears are so long they must hold them with their hands (*nie*, pronounced *nuò jiá*).\n\nThere is a settlement in the sea, a city amidst the waters and the strange creatures that emerge from them—a place where all marvels are gathered. East of it roam two tigers.\n\nKua Fu raced the sun, chasing it into the horizon. As the sun neared the land of Jiang Ren, he pursued it still. Thirst overtook him, and he drank from the Yellow River and the Wei; when these were not enough, he turned north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he reached it, he died of thirst upon the road. He cast aside his staff, which transformed into the Forest of Deng.\n\nKua Fu was the name of a divine being. That he could overtake the sun’s shadow and drain the Yellow River and Wei—was this truly about running and drinking? It was but a metaphor for such acts. Nearly did he achieve the speed of thought, arriving without moving. Here, the one becomes the ten thousand, life and death alternate, and his form vanishes into the Forest of Deng. How could one trace the workings of his numinous transformation?\n\nThe State of Bofu lies east of Nie’er. Its people are large, holding a green serpent in the right hand and a yellow serpent in the left. Deng Forest stands to its east—two trees. Another name for it is Bofu.\n\nThe Mountain of Piled Stones, where Yu amassed them, lies to its east, where the Yellow River enters. The River issues from Kunlun, flows hidden beneath the earth, and reemerges at Congling. It pours into the Salt Marsh, then flows on, emerging southward at this mountain to become the River of the Central Lands, and thus empties into the sea. The *Book of Documents* states: \"Yu guided the River past the Piled Stones.\" This speaks of times when it was blocked, so he dredged it to restore its flow.\n\nThe State of Juying lies to its east, where people grasp their cap-strings with one hand. Some say *ying* should be written as *ying* (goiter). Another name is the State of Liying.\n\nThe Xun Tree, a thousand *li* tall, stands south of Juying, growing northwest of the River. *Qi* is pronounced as *qi* (to stand on tiptoe).\n\nThe State of Qizhong lies east of Juying. Its people are large, with large feet, walking so that their heels do not touch the ground. The *Xiao Jing Gou Ming Jue* states: \"The Jiao Yao and Qi Zhong peoples, who come through interpreters to offer tribute.\" Another name is the State of Dazhong.\n\nThe Wilds of Ou Silk lie east of Dazhong. A woman kneels beneath a tree, spitting silk. The tree produces silk—this speaks of eating mulberry leaves and spitting silk, akin to silkworms.\n\nThe Three Mulberry Trees Without Branches stand east of Ou Silk. These trees are a hundred *ren* tall, without branches. All their trunks face upward, each a hundred *ren* in height.\n\nFan Forest, three hundred *li* square, lies east of the Three Mulberries, encircled by islets. These are habitable lands amid the waters, surrounding it.\n\nMount Wuyu: Emperor Zhuanxu was buried on its southern slope. Zhuanxu was called Gaoyang, and his tomb now lies in Puyang, the former Imperial Mound. Another account places it outside the city gate of Poqiu County, in Guangyang Ward. His nine consorts were buried on the northern slope. Some say there are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, Li Zhu, Chi Jiu, and *shirou* (flesh that sees).\n\nPingqiu lies east of the Three Mulberries. Here are found *yi* jade and *yi* jade (jade stones), blue horses, *shirou*, poplars, *ganzu* trees—whose branches and trunks are red, with yellow blossoms, white leaves, and black fruit. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: \"East of this mountain grows the *ganzha*.\" Its sound is like *zha* (a kind of pear). The *ganhua* tree also has red branches and trunks with yellow blossoms. A hundred fruits grow in the valley between two mountains, where two great mounds stand in the center, called Pingqiu.\n\nWithin the Northern Sea is a beast resembling a horse, called the *taotu*. In the *Er Ya*, it is pronounced *tao tu*.\n\nThere is a beast named *ju*, shaped like a white horse, with saw-like teeth that devour tigers and leopards. The *Book of Zhou* states: \"The Yi Qu people have white beasts, white as horses, with saw-like teeth that devour tigers and leopards.\" Comparing these accounts, they align with the *Er Ya*.\n\nThere is a white beast resembling a horse, called the *qiongqiong*. This is the *qiongqiong ju xu* (a swift beast), which can run a hundred *li* in one dash, as recorded in the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*. It is pronounced *qiong*.\n\nThere is a green beast resembling a tiger, called the *luoluo*.\n\nYuqiang of the North has the face of a man and the body of a crow, encircled by two green serpents, treading on two red serpents. His name is Xuanming, the Water Spirit. Zhuang Zhou said: \"Yuqiang stands at the North Pole.\" Another name is Yu Jing. One version states: \"Yuqiang of the North has a black body, hands and feet, and rides two dragons.\"\n\n**Illustrated Praises from the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Overseas North***\n\n**The State Without Kidneys**\nAll things are passed down—without offspring, there are no roots.\nWithout kidneys, the heart constructs flesh and generates the soul.\nThat this can be so is because those who honor form endure.\n\n**Zhu Long**\nThe northwest is incomplete, where the dragon clashes with fire’s essence.\nIts breath becomes cold and heat, its eye creates dusk and dawn.\nA thousand *li* long, it may be called most divine.\n\n**The State of One Eye**\nAmong the many, this one is not lacking.\nIn the wilds, the blind see clearly, perceiving what lies beyond.\nThe body travels as a guest—what is prized is the subtle.\n\n**The State of Rou Li**\nThe people of Rou Li have bent legs and elbows turned backward.\nIf one seeks a model of grace, none here are ugly.\nWhat is valued is the spirit—what does form matter?\n\n**Xiang Liu, Minister of Gong Gong**\nA minister of Gong Gong, named Xiang Liu.\nEndowed with this strange form, a serpent’s body with nine heads.\nRelying on strength and tyranny, he was ultimately captured by the Xia Lord.\n\n**The State of Deep Eyes**\nThe Deep-Eyed resemble the Hu, but their mouths are extremely sunken.\nWhen the Way of the Yellow Emperor descended, they came through interpreters to submit.\nThose with pierced chests and long legs gather together, though of different clans.\n\n**The State of Nie’er**\nThe State of Nie’er hangs upon the sea islets.\nThe carved tigers serve as envoys—all strange things are seen here.\nTheir forms are mutually dependent, their hands never leaving their faces.\n\n**Kua Fu**\nDivine Kua Fu, difficult to fathom by reason.\nDraining rivers to chase the sun, his form delayed in Deng Forest.\nTransforming by touching kind, responding without fixed intent.\n\n**The Xun Tree**\nTowering is the Xun Tree, growing by the River’s edge.\nIts branches rise a thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and sky.\nIts shade stretches to the four limits, its canopy covering Yu Yuan below.\n\n**The State of Qi Zhong**\nThough their forms are large, their feet stand on tiptoe.\nLeaping like sparrows, their heels never touch the ground.\nResponding to virtue, they come through interpreters to submit to righteousness.\n\n**The Wilds of Ou Silk**\nA woman like the *jiao* people, her body akin to silkworms and clams.\nShe produces pearls without shells, spits silk without cocoons.\nTransformations arise without pattern—how could things have fixed natures?\n\n**The State Without Intestines**\nThe people without intestines have hollow bodies.\nThe heart is the true abode of the spirit; the rest is for external use.\nAttaining the One, they preserve themselves—this principle is shared by all.\n\n**Pingqiu**\nBetween two mountains, the mound is called Ping.\nHere lie *yi* jade, fine blue horses, *shirou*, and *ganhua*.\nStrange fruits grow here.\n\n**Taotu**\nThe wild *taotu* steed comes from the northern lands.\nNecks intertwined, they rub against each other; backs turned, they prance apart.\nThough there were Sun Yang, none could ever tame them.\n\n**Yuqiang of the North**\nYuqiang, the Water Spirit, with a dark face.\nRiding dragons and treading serpents, soaring through clouds with wings.\nSpirit of the mysterious and dark, standing at the North Pole.\n\nThus concludes *The Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Eight. #1 At \"in Gong Gong’s...\": Collated editions supplement this as \"east of Gong Gong’s terrace.\"\n\n#2 The edition collated by Tan notes: \"The Gutless Land lies east of the Deep-Eyed People.\"\n\n**Scroll Nine of *The Classic of Mountains and Seas***\n*Guo Pu’s Commentary*\n**The Classic of Regions Beyond the Seas: East**\n*(From the southeast corner to the northeast corner of the lands beyond the seas.)*\n\n**Cuo Hill**\n*Cuo* sounds like *jie* (sigh); some write it as *fa* (hair).\nHere lie *yi* jade, blue horses, *shirou*, poplars, *ganzu*, and *ganhua*—where sweet fruits grow.\nIn the Eastern Sea, two mountains flank a mound. Upon it stand trees. One name is Jie Hill; another, the Land of a Hundred Fruits. It lies east of Yao’s tomb.\n\n**The Land of Giants**\nTo its north lies the Land of Giants. Its people are tall; they sit and carve boats.\nOne account places it north of □□ Hill.\n\n**The Corpse of Shebi**\nTo its north lies the Corpse of Shebi, also the name of a spirit.\nIt has the body of a beast, the face of a man, and large ears, each pierced by a green snake.\n*Er* (pierced) resembles a snake threading the ear; pronounced like the *er* in *eryu* (bait).\nOne account says the Corpse of Ganyu lies north of the Giants.\n\n**The Land of Gentlemen**\nTo its north lies the Land of Gentlemen. Its people wear caps and sashes, bear swords, and eat beasts. They keep two striped tigers at their sides. These people prize yielding and disdain strife.\nThere grows *xun* (or *jin*) grass, which blooms at dawn and withers by dusk.\nOne account places it north of the Corpse of Ganyu.\n\n**The Land of the Two-Headed**\n*Xue*□ lies to its north. Its people each have two heads.\nThe rainbow is called *didi*.\nOne account places it north of the Land of Gentlemen.\n\n**The Valley of the Morning Sun**\nIn this valley dwells the spirit Tianwu, the Water Lord.\nIt lies between two waters in Chongchong.\nAs a beast, it has eight human-faced heads, eight feet, and eight tails, all blue and yellow.\n*The Classic of the Great Wilderness: East* says ten tails.\nTo its north lies the Land of Green Hills. Its people eat the five grains and wear silk and hemp.\nTheir foxes have four legs and nine tails.\nOne account places it north of the Valley of the Morning Sun.\n*The Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery* states: \"Boyi of Bozhu campaigned in the Eastern Sea and, at the age of three lifespans, captured a nine-tailed fox—this was its kind.\"\n\nThe Lord commanded Shu Hai to pace from the easternmost to the westernmost extremity: five *yi* and ten *xuan* of steps. Shu Hai was a man of vigorous stride.\n*Xuan* means ten thousand.\nNine thousand eight hundred steps.\nShu Hai held a counting rod in his right hand and pointed to the north of Green Hills with his left.\nOne account says Yu ordered Shu Hai; another, five *yi*, ten *wan*, nine thousand eight hundred steps.\n*The Esoteric Poems* states: \"East to west, the heavens span two *yi*, thirty-three thousand *li*. North to south, two *yi*, fifteen hundred *li*. The distance between heaven and earth is one *yi*, five *wan li*.\"\n\n**The Land of Black-Teeth**\nTo its north lies the Land of Black-Teeth.\n*The Records of the Eastern Yi* says: \"East of the Wa Country, over four thousand *li*, lies the Land of the Naked. Southeast of the Land of the Naked lies the Land of Black-Teeth, reachable by ship in a year.\"\n*The Record of Strange Things* says: \"The Western Tu dye their teeth black.\" This likely refers to the same people.\nIts people are black, eat rice, and devour snakes—one red, one green (or one green snake).\nIt lies beside them.\nOne account places it north of Shu Hai: its people have black hands, eat rice, and employ snakes, one of which is red.\n\n**The Scalding Valley**\nBelow lies the Scalding Valley, where the waters run hot.\nAbove the Scalding Valley stands Fusang, a tree.\nThe ten suns bathe here, north of the Land of Black-Teeth.\nIt stands in the water, a great tree with nine suns dwelling on its lower branches and one on its upper.\nZhuang Zhou says: \"In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, scorching the grasses and trees to withering.\"\n*The Master of Huainan* also says: \"Yao ordered Yi to shoot the ten suns. He struck nine, and the crows within the suns all perished.\"\nThis is what *The Li Sao* means by \"Yi shot the suns to completion, and the crows fell in feathers.\"\n*The Scripture of the Returning to the Hidden* states: \"In ancient times, Yi was skilled at archery. He shot the ten suns and indeed finished them.\"\n*The Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery* says: \"When Yin Jia ascended the throne and ruled from the Western River, a portent appeared: ten suns emerged together.\"\nThus, this natural anomaly has its origins.\nThe *Traditions* say: \"Heaven has ten suns; the number of suns is ten.\"\nHere it is said that nine suns dwell on the lower branches and one on the upper.\n*The Classic of the Great Wilderness* further says: \"One sun is just arriving; one sun is just departing.\"\nThough heaven and earth possess ten suns, they are meant to appear in orderly succession, taking turns to illuminate the world. Now, their simultaneous appearance is a celestial omen of disaster. Thus, Yi, entrusted with Yao’s command, poured forth his numinous sincerity, drew his bow to the heavens, and the nine suns withdrew in retreat.\nIf tools can be used to spur water and kindle fire, and if concentrated essence can summon frost and reverse the sun’s course, then Yi’s brilliance in slaying the solar crows was no great difficulty.\nYet by the standards of common reason, this would be deemed impossible.\nBut if one follows the reckoning of numbers, there is nowhere it does not reach.\nThose who perceive with clarity should grasp its profound subtleties, returning them to the depths of understanding. Then, transcendent meanings will flow without obstruction, and marvelous words will not be discarded.\n\n**The Concubine of the Rain Master**\nTo its north lies the Concubine of the Rain Master. The Rain Master is called Pingyi.\nShe is black, holding a snake in each hand. A green snake coils on her left ear, a red snake on her right.\nOne account places her north of the ten suns: she has a black body and a human face, each hand grasping a turtle.\n\n**The Land of Dark Thighs**\nTo its north lies the Land of Dark Thighs. Its people are black from the thighs down—hence the name.\nThey wear fish-skin garments.\nThey eat □ (*you*), a water bird; pronounced like *you* (melancholy).\nTwo birds flank them.\nOne account places it north of the Concubine of the Rain Master.\n\n**The Land of Hairy People**\nTo its north lies the Land of Hairy People. Its inhabitants are covered in body hair. Today, some two thousand *li* southeast of Linhai Prefecture, there are hairy people dwelling on the islands of the great sea. They are short in stature, their faces and bodies entirely covered in bristles like swine. They dwell in caves and wear no clothing.\n\nIn the fourth year of the Yongjia era of the Jin, Dai Feng, the Salt Commissioner of Wu Prefecture, found a boat adrift at sea. On board were four men and women, all of this same appearance. Their speech was unintelligible. They were sent to the Chancellor’s residence, but before arriving, three died along the way, leaving only one survivor. The court granted him a wife, and they bore a child. He frequented the markets and gradually learned the human tongue. He claimed that his homeland was the Land of Hairy People. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* states: \"The Hairy People who eat millet are they.\" Another account places it north of the Land of Dark Thighs.\n\n**The Land of Toiling People**\nTo its north lies the Land of Toiling People. Its inhabitants are black. They eat fruits, grasses, and seeds. One bird has two heads. Some call them the \"People of Slaughter.\" Another account places it north of the Land of Hairy People. Their faces, eyes, hands, and feet are entirely black, and they ride upon two dragons.\n\n**Gou Mang of the East**\nGou Mang of the East has the body of a bird and the face of a man, riding two dragons. He is the assistant of Ling Weiyang, the spirit of wood. Clad in white, he governs the eastern direction.\n\n*Mozi* states: \"In ancient times, Duke Mu of Qin possessed illustrious virtue, and the Supreme God sent Gou Mang to bestow upon him nineteen additional years of life.\"\n\nIn the first year of the Jianping era, on the *bingxu* day of the fourth month, Attendant Gentleman Wang of the Chamberlain for Ceremonials submitted this collation. The compilation was overseen by Palace Attendant, Bearer of the Golden Mace, Gentleman of the Palace, and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness Gong, and Chamberlain for the Palace Garrison, Gentleman of the Palace, and Grand Master of Splendid Happiness Xiu.\n\n**Illustrations and Eulogies of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Overseas Eastern Regions***\n\n**Land of Gentlemen**\nThe qi of the East is benevolent; the land bears gentlemen.\nThey feast on fragrant blossoms, command carved tigers as servants.\nRefined in courtesy and deference, they let propriety dictate reason.\n\n**Tian Wu**\nThe vigilant Water Lord, styled the Valley Spirit.\nEight heads and ten tails, a man’s face on a tiger’s body.\nDragons harnessed to twin rivers, his might shakes all without exception.\n\n**Nine-Tailed Fox**\nA marvelous beast of Green Mound, the nine-tailed fox.\nWhen the Dao prevails, it soars into view, emerging with a scroll in its jaws.\nIt heralded auspicious omens for King Wen of Zhou, marking divine portents.\n\n**Shu Hai**\nYu commanded Shu Hai to the north of Green Mound.\nEastward to the farthest reaches, westward to the land of Bin.\nStriding across the cosmos, he illuminated the numinous power of virtue.\n\n**Ten Suns**\nTen suns rose as one, scorching grasses and trees to withered husks.\nYi drew his bow, shooting down the solar crows from on high.\nTruly a profound resonance, a celestial sign for mankind.\n\n**Land of Hairy Folk**\nThe sea crows of Lao Bei, the startled elk of Xi Zi.\nSome esteem cave-dwelling nakedness, others honor robed attire.\nCreature and self vie in esteem—who discerns right from wrong?\n\n**Land of Black-Teeth, Concubine of the Rain Master, Land of Dark-Thighed Folk, Land of Toiling Folk**\nUpon Yanggu Mountain lies the land of Black-Teeth.\nThe Rain Master’s concubine wears serpents as earrings.\nThe Dark-Thighed eat [lacuna], the Toiling Folk have blackened feet.\n\n**Gou Mang of the East**\nA spirit with a man’s face, a bird’s body clad in white.\nBearing the August Emperor’s mandate, he bestowed longevity upon Duke Mu of Qin.\nHeaven is impartial to none; those who act with goodness reap fortune.\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Nine* concludes\n\n#1 \"Sweet fruits are born\": The character *gan* (甘) is emended to *bai* (百) in Tan Jiao’s collated edition.\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Ten*\n*Guo Pu’s Commentary*\n\n**The Southern Classic of Lands Within the Seas**\n\nFrom the southeastern corner of the lands within the seas westward, beginning at the southern extremity:\n\nThe Ou dwell in the midst of the sea. The present-day Yongning County in Linhai is the Eastern Ou, situated in the Qi Sea (pronounced *qu*). The Min reside in the sea (pronounced *min*). To their northwest lies a mountain. The Min-Yue are the Western Ou, now corresponding to Jian’an Commandery, also within the Qi Sea. Another account states that Mount Min-Zhong stands in the sea.\n\n**Mountain of the Three Heavenly Sons** (pronounced *zhang*)\nLocated north of the Min and west of the sea. Today, it lies east of She County in Xin’an, now called Three Kings Mountain, from whose flank the Zhe River issues. The *Land Records of the Zhang Clan* states: Four *li* south of Yongkang County in Dongyang stands Stone City Mountain, atop which is a small stone city. It is said that the Yellow Emperor once visited this place, which was the capital of the Three Heavenly Sons. Another account places it in the sea.\n\n**Eight Trees of Guilin**\nStand in the east of Fan-Yu. Eight trees form a forest, attesting to their great size. Fan-Yu is the present-day Fan-Yu County.\n\n**State of Bo-Lü**\nUnverified.\n\n**State of Li-Er**\nTheir ears are pierced and elongated, hanging down as pendants—these are the Dang-Er. They dwell on the islets of Zhu-Ya Sea, subsisting not on the five grains but on clams and *shu-mo*.\n\n**State of Diao-Ti**\nTheir faces are stained with black dye, their bodies painted with scale-like patterns—these are the *jiao* people.\n\n**State of Bei-Xiong**\nUnverified (pronounced *qu*). All lie south of the Yu River, which rises in Mount Xiang-Ling. Another name for it is Xiang-Lü.\n\n**State of Xiao-Yang**\nLocated west of Bei-Qu. Its people have human faces, long lips, black bodies covered in hair, and reversed heels. When they see a person, they laugh, and the person laughs in return. In their left hand, they hold a tube. The *Book of Zhou* states: The people of Zhou-Mi resemble humans but have reversed heels. When they laugh, their upper lip covers their faces. The *Erya* also calls them *fang-fei*. The *Great Commentary* records that during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, the State of Zhou-Mi presented one such being. The *Classic of Lands Within the Seas* refers to them as the Gan-Chen people. Today, in the deep mountains of Nankang Commandery in Jiaozhou, such creatures are still found. They stand over a *zhang* tall, with heels turned backward, swift runners, hair unkempt, and fond of laughter. The females can secrete a fluid that causes illness if it touches a person. The local custom calls them *shan-du*. Nankang is now named after the Gan River, which took its name from these people. This is akin to the *Great Wilderness*’s account of the Yu people, after whom Mount Yu was named—an analogous case.\n\n**The Si**\nLies east of Shun’s tomb, south of the Xiang River. Its form resembles an ox, with a single black horn.\n\n**Mount Cang-Wu**\nWhere Emperor Shun was buried on its yang side—this is Mount Jiu-Yi. The *Book of Rites* also states that Shun was buried in the wilds of Cang-Wu. Emperor Dan-Zhu was buried on its yin side. Today, Dan-Yang County still has Dan-Zhu’s tomb. The *Bamboo Annals* likewise records: Hou Ji exiled Emperor Zhu to Dan-Shui. This aligns with the present account. Dan-Zhu’s posthumous title of \"Emperor\" is akin to the Han-era Lord of Shanyang being granted the posthumous name of Emperor Xian.\n\n**Si-Lin**\nSpans three hundred *li* square, located east of the *xing-xing*. Some write it as *sheng-sheng*, though the character is the same. The *xing-xing* know human names. Their form resembles a pig but with a human face. The *Book of Zhou* states: The *xing-xing* of Zheng-Guo resemble yellow dogs but have human faces, heads like roosters, and eating them prevents insomnia. Today, in Feng-Xi of Jiaozhi, *xing-xing* are found. Local lore describes them as resembling pigs yet also like dogs, their cries like those of a wailing child. They dwell west of Shun’s tomb.\n\nTo the northwest of the *xing-xing* lies the rhinoceros, its form like an ox but black. The black rhinoceros resembles a water buffalo with a pig’s head, located northwest of the *xing-xing* that know human names. It has three horns on its □ feet.\n\nMeng-Tu, a minister of the Xia ruler Qi, served as the divine overseer of Ba. When disputes arose among the people, he acted as their spiritual arbiter.\n\nThose seeking judgment in disputes would present their cases at Meng Tu’s abode, where he would render his verdict. If blood appeared upon a litigant’s garments, that person was seized—only the guilty would bleed upon their clothes. Thus did he plead for life, for he cherished all living things. He dwelt upon a mountain west of Dan Mountain. Dan Mountain lies south of Danyang, which is part of the Dan Commandery. Today, seven *li* east of Zigui County in Danyang City of Jianping Prefecture stands the site of Meng Tu’s former residence.\n\nThe *yayu* has the head of a dragon and dwells in the Weak Waters west of the *xing-xing* that know human names. Its form resembles a dragon’s head, and it devours humans. Originally a serpent with a human face, the *yayu* was slain by the minister of Erfu, only to transform into this creature.\n\nThere is a tree whose form resembles an ox. The *He Tu Yu Ban* states that *zhi* grasses grow horizontally, some like chariots and horses, others like dragons and serpents—all of this kind. When pulled, its bark peels away like the tassels of a cap or the skin of a yellow serpent. Its leaves resemble gauze, like fine silk. Its fruit resembles the *yue* tree—a tree with a yellow trunk, crimson branches, and verdant leaves, growing on Yunyu Mountain. Some write it as *mao*, others as *ma*, and still others as *yinyue*. This tree is called the *Jian* Tree, standing west of the *yayu* upon the Weak Waters. The *Jian* Tree has azure leaves, a purple stem, black flowers, and yellow fruit. Beneath it, no sound echoes, and no shadow is cast when one stands there.\n\nThe *Shiren* State—*Shi* pronounced as in *chudi* (clashing). It lies west of the *Jian* Tree. Its people have human faces and fish bodies, without feet. From the chest upward, they are human; below the chest, they are fish.\n\nThe Ba Serpent devours elephants, disgorging their bones after three years. The noble who wears these bones suffers no ailments of the heart or abdomen. Today, in the south, pythons swallow deer, and once the deer has rotted, the bones pierce through the serpent’s scales as they coil within the tree’s hollow. This is of the same kind. The *Chu Ci* states: “There is a serpent that swallows elephants—how vast must its belly be?” Commentators say it measures a thousand *xun* in length. This serpent is blue, yellow, red, and black. Another account says it is a black serpent with a blue-green head, dwelling west of the rhinoceros.\n\nThe *mao* horse resembles a horse but has hair upon its four joints. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* refers to it as the “fine-maned horse,” and there are also *mao* oxen. It dwells northwest of the Ba Serpent, south of the high mountains. The Xiongnu—another name is *Xianyu*. The Kingdom of Kaiti—*Kai* pronounced as in *ti*. The Kingdom of Lieren both lie in the northwest. These three kingdoms are all situated northwest of the *mao* horse.\n\n*From the \"Nan Jing\" of the* Hai Nei Tu Zan*: The* Xiaoyang*.*\n\nThe *fufu* is a strange beast, its hair wild, clutching bamboo. When it captures a person, it laughs, its lips covering its eyes. In the end, it wails in lament, only to be slain by its prey.\n\nThe *xingxing*—its form resembles a dog at first glance. Its nature remembers the past, and it serves as a warning to other creatures. By luring misfortune with wine, it brings ruin upon itself.\n\nMeng Xu, a minister of King Qi of Xia, presided over the lands of Ba, judging disputes and discerning right from wrong. When his rulings were unjust, blood would stain his robes. The judgments he sought were divinely inspired—alas, how subtle the workings of the gods!\n\nThere stands the *Jianmu*, bearing yellow fruit and purple branches. Its bark resembles a serpent’s scales, its leaves like white silk. Beyond its shade lie the Weak Waters, which only the righteous may cross.\n\nThe *Shi* people are descendants of the Flame Emperor. When they die, they revive, their bodies transforming into scales. They dwell in the south of the clouds, drifting upon the Celestial Ford.\n\nThe Ba Serpent—an elephant is a mighty beast, yet this serpent swallows it whole. Its bones emerge only after three years. How vast must its girth be? Even Qu Sheng would doubt it.\n\n*End of the Tenth Scroll of the* Classic of Mountains and Seas\n*Eleventh Scroll of the* Classic of Mountains and Seas\n\nGuo Pu’s Commentary on the *Inner Classic of the Seas*\n\nThe regions from the southwest corner of the inland seas to the north:\n\nThe minister of Erfu was named Wei. Wei and Erfu slew Yayu. The Thearch then shackled him in the Mountain of Sparse Kinsfolk—*gù* meaning to strike and bind, pronounced *huò*. He fettered his right foot with a wooden restraint. His hands were bound behind his back, his hair tied together with them. Thus was he tethered to a tree upon the mountain, which lies northwest of Kaiti.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, men were sent to Shang Commandery to split open a slab of stone. Within the stone chamber they found a man, naked and barefoot, his hair unbound, his hands bound behind him, one foot in fetters. They questioned the assembled ministers, but none could identify him. Liu Zizheng examined this account and matched it to the description. Emperor Xuan was greatly astonished. From that time onward, people vied to study the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nMany commentators have held that this was but a simulacrum of his corpse, not the true binding. Yet if one considers the transformations of numinous marvels, they defy rational measurement. All things are endowed with qi, arising from the impossible. They cannot be inferred by ordinary processes, nor gauged by proximate reckoning.\n\nDuring the Wei dynasty, someone opened the ancient tomb of a Zhou king and discovered a woman buried as a sacrificial victim. Neither dead nor alive, she would occasionally draw breath. After several months, she could speak, her appearance that of a woman of twenty or so. She was sent to the capital, where the Empress Dowager took a liking to her and kept her by her side. For over a decade, she remained in attendance. When the Empress Dowager passed away, the woman grieved and wept for ten days before gradually dying. This is of the same category.\n\nAt heart, a great marsh spans a hundred *li*, where flocks of birds are born and shed their feathers.\n\nHere the hundred birds give birth and shed their down and feathers. This lies north of Yanmen. The Yanmen Mountains are where wild geese emerge, situated north of Gaoliu. Gaoliu is in the land of Dai.\n\nThe tomb of Hou Ji is encircled by mountains and rivers. It lies in the wilds of Guangdu, west of the State of Shi. The State of Liuhuang Fengshi spans three hundred *li* at its center—this refers to the area within the city walls. Roads extend in the four directions, and at the center stands a mountain with thoroughfares.\n\nTo the west of Hou Ji’s tomb flows the Mystic Stream, which issues from Mount Zhong, travels west and then south to the wastes of Kunlun, and finally enters the sea in the southwest from the Blackwater Mountains. Today, the Western Sea lies in the Ting Marsh—the \"flowing sands\" described in the *Book of Documents*—its shape like the crescent moon five days after its birth.\n\nThe Eastern Hu dwell east of the great marsh; the Yi people lie east of the Eastern Hu. The State of Mo is northeast of the Han River. Today’s Fuyu Kingdom occupies the former lands of the Hui-Mo, north of the Great Wall, a thousand *li* from Xuantu. It produces famed horses, red jade, sable pelts, and large pearls the size of sour jujubes. As the land lies near Yan, it was destroyed.\n\nMengwu is also the name of a bird. Northeast of the State of Mo, this bird has a patterned beak—yellow and green—and faces east.\n\nWithin the seas lies the wastes of Kunlun in the northwest. The phrase \"within the seas\" clarifies that beyond the seas there is yet another Kunlun Mountain. This is the lower capital of the Thearch.\n\nThe wastes of Kunlun span eight hundred *li* and rise ten thousand *ren* in height. These measurements refer only to the breadth and height of its foundations. From this point upward, for over two thousand five hundred *li*, there are sweet springs and flowered pools. Five myriad *li* above the mugwort rises the center of Heaven and Earth. See the *Yü’s Basic Annals*.\n\nThere grows the Tree-Grain, five *xun* in height and five spans in girth. The Tree-Grain is a kind of millet that grows by the bend of the Blackwater and is edible. See the *Tale of King Mu’s Journey*.\n\nNine wells are arrayed on its face, their balustrades made of jade.\n\nThe balustrades are jade-railed. Nine gates stand upon its face, each guarded by the Openbright Beast; here dwell the hundred spirits. They reside in the corner crags, within the clefts of the rock. At the verge of the Redwater, none but the benevolent Yi could ascend the cliffs of the ridge—meaning that only a man of virtue or one with skills like Yi’s could scale these peaks and crags. Yi once sought the elixir from the Queen Mother of the West, which also speaks to his attainment of the Dao. Some texts render Yi as \"the Sage.\"\n\nThe Redwater issues from the southeast corner, flowing northeast, then southwest to empty into the Southern Sea, quenching the fires of Yan in the east. The Yellow River rises in the northeast corner, flowing north, then southwest into the Bohai Sea, emerging again beyond the sea, turning west and then north to enter the Accumulated Stone Mountain where Yu dredged it. Yu regulated the waters, clearing and channeling them, hence it is said he \"guided the river from the Accumulated Stone.\" The Xiang River (pronounced *xiáng*).\n\nThe Blackwater emerges from the northwest corner, flowing east, then northeast, and south into the sea near the Feathered People. The Weakwater and Bluewater issue from the southwest corner, flowing east, then north, then southwest, passing east of the *bifang* bird. The *Records of the Western Regions* state: Wuyi Kingdom lies over fifteen thousand *li* west of Chang’an, a journey of over a hundred days to the west. The Kingdom of Tiaozhi borders the Western Sea. Elders have passed down tales of Weakwater near the Queen Mother of the West. The *Records of the Eastern Yi* also mention: beyond the Great Wall by several thousand *li*, there is Weakwater—all unseen lands. The *Huainanzi* says: Weakwater flows from Exhausted Stone. Exhausted Stone is present-day Naran in the Western Commandery, likely one of its tributary sources.\n\nSouth of Kunlun lies a deep abyss, three hundred *ren* in depth—the Spirit Abyss. The Openbright Beast resembles a tiger in body (some texts say \"upright\"), with nine heads, each bearing a human face, standing eastward upon Kunlun. It is a celestial beast. The *Rong* states: \"The Openbright Beast, endowed with the essence of *Qian*, gazes upon Kunlun, its might shaking the hundred spirits.\"\n\nWest of the Openbright Beast are phoenixes and *luan* birds, all bearing serpents, treading upon serpents, with red serpents coiled upon their breasts. North of the Openbright Beast stand the Flesh That Sees, the Pearl Tree, the Veined Jade Tree, and the Five-Colored Jade Tree. The *yúqí* tree and *yúyīng* are varieties of red jade. In the first year of the Tianxi era of the Wu Kingdom, Wu Yao, an official of Linhai Commandery, found a stone tree at the edge of the sea, over three *chi* tall, its stem and leaves purple, twisting and bending with a radiant luster—this was a type of jade tree. There also grows the Tree of Immortality, meaning it lives forever.\n\nPhoenixes and *luan* birds all bear shields (pronounced *gē*). There are also the Crimson Light, the Tree-Grain, the Cypress Tree, Sweetwater (the same as the sweet spring), the Sage Tree (eating its fruit grants wisdom), and the *mànduì* (meaning unclear; one text says \"intertwining trees\"). The *Huainanzi* calls it the *xuán* tree, a type of jade.\n\nEast of the Openbright Beast dwell the shamans Peng, Zhi, Yang, Lü, Fan, and Xiang—all divine physicians. The *Genealogical Origins* states: \"Shaman Peng invented medicine.\" The *Chu Ci* says: \"The Thearch commanded Shaman Yang.\" They flank the corpse of *Yayu*, each holding the elixir of immortality to repel death, striving to revive it. *Yayu* has the body of a serpent and the face of a man, slain by the minister of Erfu.\n\nThe *Fuchang* tree has atop it a three-headed man who watches over the *langgan* tree. The nature of the *Fuchang* tree is unclear. The *langgan* fruit resembles pearls. The *Erya* says: \"Among the finest things of the northwest is the *langgan* of Kunlun.\" Zhuang Zhou speaks of a three-headed man who takes turns sleeping and waking to guard the *langgan* and *yúqí* fruit—this refers to that man.\n\nSouth of the Openbright Beast are six-headed tree-birds, *jiao* (serpent-like creatures with four legs, akin to dragons), pythons, *wei* monkeys, leopards, the *zhishu* tree (name unclear), and the *wūbiǎo* trees that mark the edges of the pools (the trees are arrayed to border the pools, which are the Flowered Pools). There are also the Reciting Bird (a bird of unclear form), the *zūn* (a type of eagle), and the *diāo*. The *Tale of King Mu’s Journey* says: \"Here there are white *zūn* and blue *diāo*\" (pronounced like *bamboo shoots*). And the Flesh That Sees.\n\n*Illustrated Praise of the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Lands Within the Seas, West\"*\n\nThe Minister of Erfu Strikes the Stone\nWithin its depths lies peril—\nLiu Sheng alone discerned it,\nwhile none among the ministers knew.\nTruly a master of broad learning,\nfor the wonders of *Mountains and Seas* are strange indeed.\n\nThe Land of Liúhuáng and Fēngshì\nIts walls span three hundred *li*,\njoined by rivers, roofed by beams.\nMovement stirs dust to dusk,\nsteaming *qi* thick as fog.\nHow might one wander here,\nto roam and revel free?\n\nThe Great Marsh of a Hundred *Li*\nCalled the \"Feather-Heaped Land,\"\nits expanse stretches a hundred *li*.\nFlocks of birds gather like clouds,\ntheir wings beating thunder.\nKing Mu turned his chariot,\nthere to honor *Lù’ěr*.\n\nThe Flowing Sands\nA boundary within and without,\ndivided by the Flowing Sands.\nThey gird the westernmost reaches,\ntumbling and winding in endless coils,\npouring into the Black Waters,\nforever drowning in their lingering waves.\n\nThe Wooden Grain\nOn the southern slopes of Kunlun,\nby the coves of the swan and egret,\nthere grows a fine grain\ncalled the Wooden Grain.\nNot planted, not cultivated,\nit scatters its sacred seeds by nature’s hand.\n\nThe Openbright Beast\nThe Openbright, celestial beast,\nendowed with the essence of metal.\nTiger-bodied, human-faced,\nit embodies this towering form.\nGlaring at Kunlun,\nits might cowers the hundred spirits.\n\nThe Veined Jade and *Yúqí* Trees\nVeined jade and *yúqí*,\nclustered by kind.\nEmerald leaves lush and trailing,\ncrimson branches delicate and bright.\nJade’s radiance vies in splendor,\ntheir hues as dazzling as fiery dragons.\n\nThe Tree of No Death\nAll things appear but briefly,\nhuman life is but a sojourn.\nThe Tree of No Death,\nits longevity eclipses heaven and earth.\nSeek its elixir from the Western Crone—\nhow could one compare to Yi?\n\nThe Sweetwater Sacred Tree\nSweet springs and jade-like trees,\nthey nurture longevity to its fullest nature.\nThey harmonize the *qi*’s balance,\nand deepen the pine’s spirit in obscurity.\nWhy must one be born with knowledge\nto be called a sage?\n\nThe *Yàyǔ*\n\nThe *Yàyǔ* was innocent,\nyet slain by Èr Fù.\nThe Thearch commanded the assembled shamans\nto grasp their medicines and stand guard in pairs.\nThus it sank into the abyss,\ntransforming into a dragon-headed being.\n\nThe *Fúcháng Lánggān* Tree\nThe *fúcháng lánggān*,\na wondrous tree of Kunlun.\nCrimson fruits hang like scattered pearls,\nverdant leaves spread like jade-green cloth.\nThree heads keep watch in turn,\ngazing and regarding one another.\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Eleven concludes.\n#1 Its crows bear vermilion markings. (Tan’s edition supplements: “Its crows bear red markings.”)\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Twelve\nGuo Pu’s Commentary\n*Canon of the Northern Regions Within the Seas*\n\nBeyond the northwest corner of the seas lies the Mountain of the Serpent Shamans,\nwhere a figure stands holding a cup, facing east.\nAnother name: Turtle Mountain.\n(The character for “cup” may also be written as *bàng*, though the meaning is the same.)\n\nQueen Mother of the West leans upon a stool, wearing a *dàishèng* headdress and holding a staff.\n(*Tī* here means “to lean upon.”)\nTo her south are three azure birds,\nwho gather food for the Queen Mother.\nThere is also a three-legged crow,\nwho serves as her attendant.\nThis is north of the Kunlun Wilderness.\n\nA figure called the Earl of the Great Road holds a halberd.\nTo his east lies the Land of the Dog Seals.\nLong ago, *Pánhù* slew the Rong king; Gao Xin gave him a beautiful woman in marriage. As he could not be civilized, he was set adrift upon the southeastern sea near Kuaiji, where he obtained three hundred *li* of land to rule. His male descendants became dogs, his female descendants fair women—thus the people of the Dog Seal Land.\nThe corpse of Èr Fù lies east of the Earl of the Great Road.\n\nThe Land of the Dog Seals is also called the Land of the Dog Rong. Bian Ming, a descendant of the Yellow Thearch, begot two white dogs, male and female, who coupled and gave rise to this nation. Their form resembles that of dogs. (This is the so-called “Dog Nation.”)\nA woman kneels to offer food in a cup—\nshe feeds the dogs.\n\nThere are patterned horses with white bodies and crimson manes,\ntheir coats as pale as raw silk.\nTheir eyes gleam like yellow gold; they are called *Jíliàng* (or *Jíliáng*).\nOne who rides them may live a thousand years.\nThe *Book of Zhou* states: “The Dog Rong presented a patterned horse with a white body and red mane, eyes like yellow gold, called the *Jíhuáng* steed. It was offered to King Cheng.”\nThe *Six Strategies* says: “A horse with a patterned body, crimson mane, eyes like yellow gold, and a head like a rooster’s tail is called the *Jīsī* steed.”\nThe *Great Commentary* says: “A dappled body, crimson mane, and rooster’s eyes.”\nThe *Classic of Mountains and Seas* also mentions the *Jíhuáng* steed, which grants a thousand years of life to its rider. Though the names differ slightly and the accounts vary in minor details, they refer to the same creature.\nHere, we broadly cite them to expand the realm of marvels.\n\nThe Ghost Country lies north of the corpse of Èr Fù, its beings having human faces and a single eye. Another account says the Èr Fù spirit resides to its east, its beings having human faces and serpentine bodies. The *Táo* dog resembles a dog, is blue-green, and makes a sound like \"táo.\" It devours humans starting from the head. Some write it as *qú*. *Qú* means \"head *qú*.\" The *Qióngqí* resembles a tiger, has wings, and bristles like a hedgehog. It devours humans starting from the head, and those it eats have disheveled hair. It dwells north of the *Táo* dog. Another account says it begins from the feet.\n\nThe Terrace of Emperor Yáo, the Terrace of Emperor Kù, the Terrace of Emperor Dānzhū, and the Terrace of Emperor Shùn—each has two terraces, all four-sided—stand northeast of Kūnlún. These were likely places where the Son of Heaven passed during his tours of inspection. The barbarians, admiring the sagely virtue and power, jointly built these terraces and towers to mark and honor his traces. Another version states: Where Xiāngliǔ was slain, the land reeked so foully that the five grains could not be planted, hence the terraces of the many emperors were built there.\n\nThe *Great Wasp* resembles a *lí* (gourd-shaped wasp). The *Zhū É* resembles a moth. *É* refers to the *pífú* (ant). The *Chu Ci* says: \"The dark wasp is like a pot, the red floss like an elephant,\" referring to these. The *Jiǎo* has a human form with tiger stripes and calves with bulging muscles—its legs have *bó* sinews—sounding like \"qiáo.\" It dwells east of the *Qióngqí*. Another account says it resembles a human and is found north of Kūnlún’s ruins. These are the matters recorded above.\n\nThe *Tàfēi* has a human face and a beast’s body, and is blue-green in color, sounding like \"tà.\" Some say it resembles a *chuán* beam. *Zhīshī* has a human form with a broken neck, disheveled hair, and lacks one hand. The *Huánjū* has a beast’s head and a human body. Another account says it resembles a hedgehog-like dog and is yellow. The *Mǒ* has a human body, a black head, and vertical eyes. *Mǒ* is the same as a *mèi* (specter). The *Róng* has a human head with three horns.\n\nThe State of the Lín Clan possesses a rare beast, large as a tiger, with all five colors fully present, its tail longer than its body. It is called *Líwú*, and riding it allows one to travel a thousand *lǐ* in a day. The *Six Strategies* states: \"When King Zhòu imprisoned King Wén, Hóng Yǎo and his followers went to the State of the Lín Clan and obtained this beast, presenting it to Zhòu, who was greatly pleased and thus released Wén.\" The *Book of Zhou* says: \"In Jiā Lín, there is the *Qiú’ěr*, which resembles a tiger, its tail three times the length of its body, and it eats tigers and leopards.\" The *Great Commentary* calls it the *Zhí* beast. *Wú* should be written as *Yú*.\n\nSouth of Kūnlún’s ruins lies the *Fàn* Forest, spanning three hundred *lǐ*. The *Cóngjí* Abyss is three hundred *rèn* deep, where *Bīng Yí* (Píng Yí) eternally resides. *Bīng Yí* is *Féng Yí*. The *Huainanzi* says: \"Féng Yí attained the Dao and submerged himself in the great abyss,\" referring to the River Earl. This is the *Hébó Wúyí* mentioned in the *Tale of King Mu*. The *Bamboo Annals* writes it as *Féng Yí*. The character may also be written as *Bīng*. *Bīng Yí* has a human face and rides two dragons. In paintings, he has four faces, each riding a spirit chariot drawn by two dragons. Another account calls it the *Zhōngjí* Abyss.\n\nThe *Yángwū* Mountain is where the Yellow River originates, as is the *Língmén* Mountain. Both are sources of the river’s tributaries. The corpse of *Wáng Yèyè* has its hands, thighs, chest, head, and teeth all severed and scattered in different places. This is likely a case of bodily dissolution yet spiritual connection, where form diverges but *qi* unites—united yet not intimate, separated yet not distant.\n\nShùn’s wife, Lady *Dēngbǐ*, bore *Xiāomíng* and *Zhúguāng*, the names of her two daughters, so named for their ability to illuminate. They dwell by the great river and marshes, where the waters overflow. The numinous power of the two daughters can illuminate a hundred *lǐ* in all directions. Another account calls her Lady *Dēngběi*.\n\nThe *Gài* State lies south of *Jùyàn* and north of *Wō*, with *Wō* subject to *Yàn*. The *Wō* State is in the great sea east of *Dàifāng*, ruled by a queen. Their custom is to wear their hair loose, their clothing lacks stitching, they paint their bodies with cinnabar, and they are not jealous—one man may have dozens of wives.\n\n*Cháoxiǎn* lies east of *Lièyáng*, north of the sea and south of the mountains. *Lièyáng* belongs to *Yàn Jùlǔ Xiān*, now *Lèlàng* County, the fief of Jīzǐ. *Liè* is also the name of a river, cold in *Dàifāng*, where *Dàifāng* has a *Lièkǒu* County. *Liègūshè* is in the river isles of the sea—a mountain name, where divine beings dwell. The river isles lie in the sea where the river flows. This is the *Miǎo Gūshè* Mountain mentioned in the *Zhuāngzǐ*. The *Gūshè* State is in the sea, belonging to *Liègūshè*, encircled by mountains to the southwest.\n\nThe *Great Crab* dwells in the sea, likely a crab spanning a thousand *lǐ*. The *Língyú* has a human face, human hands and feet, and a fish’s body, dwelling in the sea. The *Great Biān* resides in the sea. *Biān* is the *fáng* fish, sounding like \"biān.\" *Míngzǔ* Village lies in the sea, sounding like \"zǔ.\" *Pénglái* Mountain is in the sea, where immortals’ palaces and chambers are all made of gold and jade. Birds and beasts are entirely white, and from afar, it appears like clouds, lying in the *Bóhǎi* Sea. The *Market of the Great Ones* is in the sea.\n\n*Illustrated Eulogies of the Inner Seas: Northern Classic* — *Jíliáng*\n\nThe golden essence gleams with crimson mane, dragons stride in majestic poise.\nWith stately steps, the wild geese rise and fall, dust swirls beneath their flight.\nThis is called *Jíhuáng*, dwelling in the sacred precincts of *Yǒulǐ*.\n\n**Snake Shamans, Mountain Spirits, and the Great Swarm of the Celestial Terrace**\nThe mountain of *Jiǎzhī* harbors one who holds a cup.\nThe spirits and *táo* demons bring misfortune and calamity.\nThe great bees and crimson moths gather at the terrace of the host of emperors.\n\n**Tàfēi, Jùbǐ, Corpse Spirits, and Róng Demons**\nMan-faced and beast-bodied, this is called *Tàfēi*.\nWith disheveled hair and broken neck, the corpse of *Jùbǐ*.\nThe *Róng* bears three horns, the demon’s brows stand erect.\n\n**Zōuyú**\nA wondrous beast of five colors, its tail as long as its body.\nIts swift hooves traverse a thousand *lǐ*, fleet as a spirit—this is the *Zōuyú*,\nlauded in poetry for its benevolence.\n\n**Bīngyí**\nEndowed with the essence of radiant splendor, refining and consuming the eight stones.\nRiding dragons in hidden depths, coming and going with the sea’s tides—\nthis is the *Shuǐshàn*, known as the River Earl.\n\n**Wángyǔ and the Night Corpse**\nThe corpse of the night, its body divided into seven.\nThough parted, they are not distant; though joined, they are not crowded.\nIf governed by spirit, form returns to unity.\n\n**Xiāomíng and Zhúguāng**\nIn the waters dwell fair ones, *Xiāomíng* and *Zhúguāng*.\nTheir radiance flows along the river’s edge, bearing this wondrous auspice.\nThese are the two daughters of Shun, dwelling apart in separate realms.\n\n**Liègūshè, the Great Crab, and the Mound Fish**\nThe *Gūshè* Mountain is the true abode of the western transcendents.\nThe great crab spans a thousand *lǐ*, and the scaled *líng* fish also dwells here.\nVast is the boundless sea, harboring marvels and treasures.\n\n**Pénglái Mountain**\nThe mountain of *Pénglái*, its forests wrought of jade and azure.\nGolden terraces and cloud-borne pavilions, how resplendent its beasts and birds!\nTruly a divine realm, where the heart delights in jade.\n\n*The Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Twelve—End*\n*The Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Thirteen*\n\n**Guō Pú’s Commentary on *The Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Eastern Lands***\n\n**The Eastern and Northeastern Regions**\nBeyond the northeastern corner lies the land of *Jùyàn*. The states within the Flowing Sands include *Zhǔnduān* (pronounced *dūn*). *Xǐ* (pronounced *huàn*, also written as *茧蠕*) lies southeast of *Kūnlún’s* ruins. Some say it is *Méinèi* Prefecture, though it is not governed as a commandery or county, but rather lies within the Flowing Sands. The states beyond the Flowing Sands include *Dàxià*, whose capital is square and spans two to three hundred *lǐ*, divided into dozens of smaller domains. Its land is fertile and rich, yielding the five grains in abundance. *Jiānshā* and *Jūyáo* (pronounced *yáo*) are part of the *Yuèzhī* kingdom. The *Yuèzhī* are famed for their fine horses and luscious fruits, and their great-tailed sheep, whose tails resemble those of donkeys—these are the *xián* sheep. The *Xiǎoyuèzhī* and *Tiānzhú* (India) are its tributary states.\n\n**The Western Hu and Jade Mountains**\nThe White Jade Mountain of the Western Hu lies east of *Dàxià*, while *Cāngwú* is southwest of the White Jade Mountain. Both are situated west of the Flowing Sands and southeast of *Kūnlún’s* ruins. *Kūnlún* Mountain lies west of the Western Hu, in the far northwest. According to the *Treatise on Geography*, *Kūnlún* Mountain is west of *Línqiāng*, and there stands a shrine to the Queen Mother of the West.\n\n**The Thunder Marsh and Divine Traces**\nWithin the Thunder Marsh dwells the Thunder Spirit, dragon-bodied and human-headed, who drums his belly. It lies west of *Wú*. Today, in *Chéngyáng*, there is *Yáo’s* tomb and the *Língtái* Terrace, with the Thunder Marsh to its north. The *River Chart* states: \"The great footprint lies in the Thunder Marsh, and *Huáxū* trod upon it, giving birth to *Fúxī*.\"\n\n**Islands and Coastal Realms**\n*Dūzhōu* lies in the sea. Another name is *Yùzhōu*. Today, it is within the borders of *Xiōng* County in the Eastern Sea. Legend holds that this mountain migrated from *Cāngwú* in the south, and its summit bears the flora of the southern lands. *Yù* is pronounced *yù*.\n\nThe *Lángyá* Terrace stands between the *Bóhǎi* Sea and the east of *Lángyá*. Today, *Lángyá* is by the sea, where a towering peak rises abruptly, resembling a lofty terrace—this is the *Lángyá* Terrace. *Lángyá* was the capital where *Gōujiàn*, King of *Yuè*, established his hegemony over the Central States. To its north lies a mountain. Some say it is amid the sea.\n\n*Hányàn* is in the sea, south of *Dūzhōu*. *Shǐjiū* is in the sea, south of *Yuánlì*. It is either a state’s name or the name of a bird. *Kuàijī* Mountain lies south of *Dàchǔ*.\n\n**The Three Rivers of Mín**\nThe first of the Three Rivers is the Great River, which rises in *Wèn* Mountain. Today, the river originates in *Kūn* Mountain of *Shēngqiān* County in *Wènshān* Prefecture, flowing southeast through *Jiànwèi* in *Shǔ* Prefecture. It passes northeast of *Jiāngyáng*, then through *Bādōng*, *Jiànpíng*, *Yídū*, *Nánjùn*, *Jiāngxià*, *Yìyáng*, and *Ānfēng*, reaching the southern border of *Lújiāng*. From there, it flows northeast through *Huáinán* and *Xià’nà*, entering the sea at *Guǎnglíng* Prefecture.\n\nThe Northern River rises in *Màn* Mountain, and the Southern River in *Gāo* Mountain. *Gāo* Mountain lies west of *Chéngdū*, and its waters enter the sea south of *Chángzhōu*. The *Zhè* River rises in the *Three Son-of-Heaven Peaks* to its east. According to the *Treatise on Geography*, the *Zhè* River originates in the southern wilds of *Xīn’ān* and *Yí* County, flowing east into the sea. Today’s *Qiántáng* *Zhè* River is the same. *Yí* is now *Shè*, and *Zhè* is pronounced *zhé*.\n\nIn the northwest of *Mǐn*, its waters enter the sea south of *Yújì*. *Yújì* County belongs to *Kuàijī* Prefecture and is now *Yǒngxīng* County. The *Lú* River rises in the *Three Son-of-Heaven Peaks* and flows into the river west of *Péngzé*. *Péngzé* is today’s *Pénglǐ*, in *Péngzé* County of *Xúnyáng*.

It flows through *Rǔnán*, *Rǔyīn*, *Huáinán*, *Qiáoguó*, and *Xià’nà*, entering the sea at *Guǎnglíng* County. *Cháoyáng* County now belongs to *Xīnyě*.\n\nThe *Xiāng* River rises southeast of *Shùn’s* burial site, winding westward around it. *Huán* means \"to encircle.\" Today, the *Xiāng* River originates in *Yángshuò* Mountain of *Yíngdào* County in *Línglíng*, flowing into the river and then into *Dòngtíng* below. *Dòngtíng* is an earthen cavern in *Bālíng* of *Chángshā*. Today, in the great lake south of *Wú* County, there is *Bāo* Mountain, beneath which lies *Dòngtíng*. Its subterranean passages course beneath the water, said to connect everywhere—it is called the \"earth’s veins.\" Some say it is the \"Marsh of the Southeast and West.\"\n\nThe *Hàn* River rises in *Fùyú* Mountain. The *Book of Documents* states: \"*Bōzhǒng* guides the *Yàng*, which flows east to become the *Hàn*.\" According to the *Water Classic*, the *Hàn* River originates in *Lánggǔ* east of *Jǔ* County in *Wǔdū*, flowing through *Hànzhōng* and *Wèixīng* to *Nánxiāng*. It then flows east through *Xiāngyáng* and enters the river at *Ānlù* County in *Jiāngxià*.

Some say it is *Gōushì*. The county belongs to *Hénán* and is pronounced *gōu*.\n\nThe *Rǔ* River rises in *Tiānxī* Mountain, southwest of *Liángmiǎn* Township, and enters the *Huái* at its extreme northwest. Today, the *Rǔ* River originates northeast of *Dàmèng* Mountain in *Lǔyáng* County of *Nányáng*, flowing southeast through *Liáng* County in *Hénán*. It then passes through *Xiāngchéng*, *Yǐngchuān*, and *Rǔnán* to *Bāoxìn* County in *Rǔyīn*, where it enters the *Huái*. *Huáijí* is a place name. Some say the *Huái* is north of *Qīsī*. *Qīsī* County belongs to *Yìyáng*.\n\nThe *Jīng* River rises in the northern mountains of *Chángchéng*, which lie in *Yùzhì*. *Chángyuán* is to its north—both are county names. *Nà* is pronounced *zhì*.

North of *Huái* lies *Jǐngxíng* Mountain.\n\nThe *Jǐ* River rises south of *Gòng* Mountain in *Dōngqiū*—*gòng* is interchangeable with *gōng*. It cuts across *Jùlù* Marsh—*jué* meaning \"to cross\" or \"to traverse.\" *Jùlù* now lies in *Gāopíng*. It flows into the *Bóhǎi* Sea, entering northeast of *Lánghuái* in *Qí*. Now the *Jǐ* River flows east from *Juǎn* County of *Róngyáng*, passing through *Chénliú* to the north of *Qiányīn*, then northeast through *Gāopíng*, further northeast through *Jǐnán*, and reaching *Bóchāng* County of *Lè’ān* before entering the sea—now *Jiéshí*.\n\nThe sources of these rivers often diverge from the accounts in the *Shuǐjīng*.\n\nConsidering the rivers and mountains may share names yet differ in reality, or share reality yet differ in names, or one reality may bear multiple names—what seems correct may be false, and what seems false may be correct. Moreover, with the passage of ages, ancient and modern names have shifted, and regional languages vary between *Chǔ* and *Xià*, making precise identification difficult.\n\nThe *Liáo* River rises east of *Wèi Gāo*, emerging from beyond the frontier at *Wèi Gāo* Mountain in *Xuántú*. *Gāogōulí* County has *Liáo* Mountain, which is also a source of the *Liáo* River. It flows west into the *Great Liáo*. (*Liáo* is pronounced like *liáo*.) It then flows southeast into the *Bóhǎi* Sea, entering at *Liáo*yáng. *Liáo*yáng County belongs to *Liáo*dōng.\n\nThe *Hū* Pond River rises south of *Jìnyáng* City, flows west to the north of *Yángqǔ*, then east into the *Bóhǎi* Sea, passing through *Lè* City in *Héjiān*, and northeast into the *Bóhǎi* Sea. *Jìnyáng* and *Yángqǔ* Counties belong to *Tàiyuán* Prefecture. It enters north of *Yuèzhāng* Commandery. (*Yuèzhāng* is the name of a commandery.)\n\nThe *Zhāng* River rises east of *Yáng*, flows east into the *Bóhǎi* Sea, entering south of *Zhāngwǔ*. *Xīnchéng* and *Biànyīn* Counties also have a *Zhāng* River.\n\nIn the fourth month of the first year of *Jiànpíng*, on the *bǐngxū* day, Expectant Appointee and Attendant Gentleman of the Ministry of Ceremonies, your servant *Wàng*, collated this text.\n\nOverseen by the Palace Attendant, *Guānglùxūn*, your servant *Gōng*; the Palace Attendant, Chariot Master, and *Guānglù Dàfū*, your servant *Xiù*, who directed the review.\n\n*Map of the Eastern Realm Within the Seas*\n*Yù* Prefecture\n\nThe Southernmost Mountains extend beyond the Eastern Sea.\nWithout journeying, they arrive; without movement, they transform.\nThis is the work of the divine—things have no permanence.\n\n*Hán-Yàn* begins as a *jiū*, the spirit of *Léizé*:\n*Hán-Yàn* begins as a *jiū*, dwelling on an island in the sea.\nThe spirit of *Léizé* drums its belly, roaming in leisure.\n*Lángyá* soars aloft, distant as cloud-borne towers.\n\n*Jiānshā Jūyáo*, *Zhǔnduān Xǐ*□ Kingdom:\n*Jiānshā Jūyáo*, *Zhǔnduān Xǐ*□—\nA land of desert sands, a lodge at the world’s end.\nSome were hostages to *Qín*, others guests of *Hàn*.\n\nThe Great River, the Northern River, the Southern River, the *Zhè* River,\n*Lú*, *Huái*, *Xiāng*, *Hàn*, *Méng*, *Wēn*, *Yǐng*, *Rǔ*,\n*Jīng*, *Wèi*, *Bái*, *Yuán*, *Gàn*, *Sì*, *Yù*, *Yì*,\n*Huáng*, *Luò*, *Fén*, *Qìn*, *Jǐ*, *Lǎo*, *Hūchí*, the *Zhāng* River—\nWaterways crisscross, waves unfurling like sashes.\nChannels flow downward, weaving through the land beyond the *Huá*.\nDiverging in source, converging in return, they merge in the eastern confluence.\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Thirteen—End\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Fourteen—Collated and Supplemented\n\n**Guo Pu’s Commentary on *The Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Eastern Wilderness***\n\nBeyond the Eastern Sea lies a great chasm. *The Odes, Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"It pours eastward into a bottomless valley.\" This refers to that chasm.\n\nThe land of **Shaohao**. Shaohao was the **Jintian Clan**, an epithet of **Emperor Zhi**. Shaohao nurtured **Emperor Zhuanxu** here—*nurtured* (*ru*), its meaning unclear. He abandoned his zither and se there, for the chasm is said to contain such instruments.\n\nThere is **Gan Mountain**, from which the **Gan River** flows, forming **Gan Abyss**—where waters gather to become a deep pool.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Pimu Diqiu**.\n\nBeyond the Eastern Sea, within the Great Wilderness, there is a mountain named **Dayan**, where the sun and moon rise.\n\nThere is **Bogu Mountain**, home to the **Land of Giants**. In the second year of the **Yongjia** era of Jin, a **crane-hawk** alighted in **Aobei Pond**, twenty *li* south of **Shian County**, where the local Zhou Hu captured it. A wooden arrow, tipped with an iron point, pierced it—six and a half *chi* in length. Judging by the arrow’s proportions, the archer must have stood fifteen or sixteen *chi* tall. Furthermore, **Gao Hui**, Vice Prefect of **Pingzhou**, recounted: Travelers from **Wa** were once blown by wind across the sea, where they encountered a land whose people all stood over ten *chi* tall, their forms resembling Hu. These must have been a branch of the **Tall Di**. The arrow likely came from that land.\n\n*The Outer Traditions* state: The **Jiaoyao** people stand three *chi* tall, the shortest of all; the tallest do not exceed ten *zhang*. This is the limit of human stature. According to *The River Chart: Jade Tablet*: Nine thousand *li* north of **Kunlun**, one finds the **Longbo** people, thirty *zhang* tall, who live eighteen thousand years before dying. Ten thousand *li* east of Kunlun lies the land of the **Great Qin**, whose people stand ten *zhang* tall and all wear silk. Another ten thousand *li* east lies the **Tiao** people, three *zhang* and five *chi* tall. Ten thousand *li* beyond them is the **Middle Qin** land, where people stand one *zhang* tall.\n\n*The Guliang Commentary* says: The **Tall Di** measure nine *mu* across the body; when they carry their heads, their brows appear above the crossbar of a chariot. These are the people of several *zhang* in height. In the Qin era, a giant appeared in **Lintao**, five *zhang* tall, with footprints six *chi* long. Judging by these accounts, the stature of such giants cannot be precisely measured.\n\nThere is a **Market of Giants**, called the **Hall of Giants**—also a mountain, shaped like a hall, where giants gather to trade. One giant crouches atop it, stretching his ears wide. *Crouches* (*cun*), sometimes written as *jun*, is an ancient form of *dun*. *The Zhuangzi* says: \"Crouching on **Mount Kuaiji**.\"\n\nThere is a **Land of Little People** called the **Jing People**. *The Odes, Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"In the far northeast live people nine *cun* tall.\" This likely refers to these little people. Sometimes written as *Jing*, the pronunciation is the same.\n\nThere is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body, named **Li Qin** (pronunciation uncertain), the corpse of **Zhi**.\n\nThere is **Jue Mountain** (pronounced like *jue* in *deceit*). The **Yang River** flows from it.\n\nThere is the **Wei Kingdom**, whose people eat millet—this land contains only millet fields. *Wei* is pronounced *wei* (as in *false*).\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **He Xu**, where the sun and moon rise.\n\nThere is the **Zhongrong Kingdom**. **Emperor Jun** begot **Zhongrong**—*Jun* is a phonetic loan for *Shun*. The Zhongrong people eat beasts and the fruits of trees. This land has **red trees** and **black trees**, whose blossoms and fruits are beautiful, as recorded in *The Annals of Lü Buwei*. They employ four beasts: leopards, tigers, bears, and brown bears.\n\nThere is **Eastern Mouth Mountain**.\n\nThere is the **Land of Gentlemen**, whose people wear caps, sashes, and swords. They also employ tigers and leopards, for they value humility and deference.\n\nThere is the **Siyou Kingdom**. **Emperor Jun** begot **Yanlong**, Yanlong begot **Siyou**. Siyou begot **Thoughtful Scholars**, who take no wives, and **Thoughtful Women**, who take no husbands. Their people conceive through mutual longing and the communion of qi, bearing children without union—this is what *The Zhuangzi* describes as \"white cranes gazing at one another, their pupils unmoving,\" eating millet and beasts, and employing four birds. They are transformed by the wind’s influence.\n\nThere is **Great Al Mountain**.\n\nIn the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Bright Star**, where the sun and moon emerge.\n\nThere is the **Land of the White People**. **Emperor Jun** begot **Emperor Hong**, and Emperor Hong begot the White People. The White People bear the surname Xiao, eat millet, and employ four beasts: tigers, leopards, bears, and brown bears. There is also the **Chariot-Yellow Beast**; riding it grants long life. There is the **Land of Green Hills**, where foxes with nine tails dwell. They appear as auspicious omens in times of peace.\n\nThere is the **Land of the Gentle Servants**, which is a land of fertile soil. \"Fertile\" here means rich and abundant. There is the **Land of Black Teeth**, where **Emperor Jun** begot the Black-Teeth People, whose teeth are black as lacquer. The sagely and divine transform without bound, thus their descendants often take on strange forms and unusual appearances. Those said to be \"begotten\" are generally their descendants, not necessarily their direct offspring. They bear the surname Jiang, eat millet, and employ four beasts.\n\nThere is the **Land of Xiazhou**. There is the **Land of Gaiyu**. There is a divine being with eight heads, a human face, the body of a tiger, and ten tails, named **Tianwu**, the Water Lord.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Juling Reaching Heaven**, also known as **Mount Ju**. **Eastern Extremity** and **Limou** are the names of three mountains. The sun and moon emerge here.\n\nThere is a spirit named **Zhedan**, a divine being. In the east, he is called **Zhe**; when summoned, he is called **Xu**. The east wind is called **Jun**, though the location of the east wind remains unclear. He dwells at the eastern extremity, controlling the entry and exit of the wind, regulating its flow in due time.\n\nOn an islet in the Eastern Sea resides a spirit with a human face and a bird’s body, encircled by two yellow serpents, with serpents threaded through its ears. It treads upon two yellow serpents and is named **Yu□**. The Yellow Emperor begot Yu□, and Yu□ begot **Yujing** (also known as **Yujian**). Yujing dwells in the Northern Sea, while Yu□ dwells in the Eastern Sea—both are sea gods, each governing a portion of the sea as its deity.\n\nThere is **Mount Zhaoyao**, from which the **Rong River** flows. There is a land called **Xuangu**, where the people are black as lacquer from the waist down. They eat millet and employ four beasts.\n\nThere is the **Land of the Yin People**, who bear the surname Gou and eat *yin*. There is a man named **Wang Hai**, holding birds in both hands while devouring one’s head. Wang Hai entrusted himself to the **Youyi** and the **River Lord’s Oxherd**, both of whom are human names, as recorded in the *Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery*. The Youyi killed Wang Hai and seized the oxherd. The *Bamboo Annals* state: \"Prince Hai of Yin, visiting the Youyi, indulged in debauchery. The lord of Youyi, Mianchen, killed him and flayed his body. Thus, King Jiawei of Yin borrowed troops from the River Lord to attack the Youyi, annihilating them and slaying their lord, Mianchen.\"\n\nThe River Lord remembered the Youyi, who secretly escaped and transformed into a land of beasts, devouring one another—this is the **Land of the Bo People**. **Emperor Shun** begot **Xi**, and Xi begot the Bo People. The Youyi were once close allies of the River Lord, but King Jiawei of Yin, a virtuous ruler, borrowed troops in righteous punishment. The River Lord, compelled by duty, aided in their destruction. Later, moved by pity for the Youyi, he allowed them to secretly transform into the Land of the Bo People.\n\nWithin the seas dwell two beings, transformations of the Youyi, named **Lady Chou**. This is the corpse of Lady Chou, for her transformations are boundless. Thus, those who traverse the ford of change and enter the realm of spirits find no place they cannot go, their traces manifesting wherever they are stirred. Even the likes of Fan Li have heard of such wonders.\n\nLady Chou possesses a great crab, a thousand *li* wide!\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **□Shaking Ram’s Head**, upon which grows the **Fu Tree**, its trunk rising three hundred *li* high, its leaves like those of the mustard plant. There is a valley called **Warm Spring Valley**, which is the **Boiling Valley**. Atop the Boiling Valley stands the Fu Tree, with the **Fusang** upon it. As one sun arrives, another departs, their movements alternating in succession, all borne by crows—these are the three-legged crows.\n\nThere is a spirit with the face of a man, the ears of a dog, and the body of a beast, who wears two blue-green serpents as earrings—this is **Shebishi**. There is a five-colored bird that faces its kin and discards sand. The meaning of \"discarding sand\" is unknown, nor is it known why **Di Jun** befriended it below. The Emperor descended to two altars, where the five-colored crows preside. It is said that beneath the mountain lie two altars of Shun, overseen by the five-colored crows.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Yitian Sumen**, where the sun and moon are born. There is the **Xuanmin** nation, their speech resembling clamor. There is **Qishan** (pronounced *ji*), as well as **Yaoshan**. There is **□shan** (pronounced like the *zeng* of a steamer), **Menhushan**, **Shengshan**, and **Daishan**. There are five-colored birds.\n\nIn the Eastern Wilderness lies a mountain named **Heming Junji**, where the sun and moon emerge. There is the **Zhongrong** nation. Beyond the northeastern sea are blue-green horses, three **zhui** (horses with mixed black and white manes), and **Ganhua**. Here lie **Yiyu**, three blue-green birds, three *zhui*, **Shirou**, **Ganhua**, **Ganzu**, and the hundred grains—all said to grow spontaneously. There is the nation of **Nühe Yuemu**.\n\nThere is a being named **□** (pronounced *wan*). The north is called **□**, and the wind that comes from it is called **□**. This is to say, it has two names (pronounced *yan*).\n\nAt this place in the easternmost corner, the sun and moon are restrained, preventing their alternating emergence and setting—thus governing their length. It is said that **□** oversees and examines the paired months’ ingress and egress, ensuring they do not intermingle or err, thereby discerning the short and long of their cycles.\n\nIn the northeastern corner of the Great Wilderness lies a mountain named **Xiongli Tuqiu**. **Yinglong** dwells in the southern extremity—**Yinglong** being a dragon with wings. He slew **Chiyou** and **Kua Fu**—**Chiyou** being the forger of weapons. Denied ascent thereafter, the world below suffered frequent droughts, for **Yinglong** remained beneath the earth, and none above could summon rain. When drought strikes, crafting an effigy of **Yinglong** brings forth great rain. Today’s earthen dragons trace their origin to this. The resonance of *qi* follows a natural, numinous response—beyond human contrivance.\n\nIn the Eastern Sea stands **Liubo Mountain**, seven thousand *li* from the shore. Upon it dwells a beast resembling an ox, its body azure, hornless, and possessing but a single foot. Whenever it enters or emerges from water, wind and rain arise; its radiance rivals the sun and moon, its form like thunder—its name is **Kui**. The **Yellow Emperor** captured it, fashioning its hide into a drum, striking it with the bones of the **Thunder Beast**—the **Thunder Beast** being the **Thunder Deity**, a being with a human face and dragon’s body who drums upon its belly. *Jue* here means \"to strike.\" The sound carries five hundred *li*, instilling awe throughout the realm.\n\n*End of Scroll Fourteen of the Classic of Mountains and Seas*\n*Scroll Fifteen of the Classic of Mountains and Seas*\n\n**The Southern Wilderness Classic**\n\nBeyond the Southern Sea, west of the **Red Waters** and east of the **Flowing Sands**, the Red Waters issue from **Kunlun Mountain**, and the Flowing Sands from **Bell Mountain**. There is a beast with heads on both left and right, named **□Ti**. It emerges from the **□Ming Nation**—*Chuti* (two readings: *chu* and *ti*). Three azure beasts stand side by side, called **Shuangshuang** (\"Paired\"), their bodies merged as one. This is what the *Gongyang Commentary* refers to as \"arriving in pairs.\"\n\nThere is **A Mountain**. In the midst of the Southern Sea lies **Floating Heaven Mountain**, where the Red Waters reach their end, their flow culminating at this peak. East of the Red Waters lies the **Cangwu Wilds**, where **Shun** and **Shu Jun** are buried. Shu Jun is **Shang Jun**. When Shun died on his imperial tour in Cangwu, he was interred there, and Shang Jun, who remained, was also buried in the same place. Their tombs now lie within the **Nine Doubts**. Here are found **patterned cowries** (purple cowries), **Li Yu** (the same as **Li Zhu**), **□Jiu**, **Ying Jia** (*Jia* being a kind of hawk), **Wei Wei**, bears, brown bears, elephants, tigers, leopards, wolves, and **gazing flesh**.\n\nThere is **Xing Mountain**, from which the **Xing River** flows. South of the **Black Waters** is a **dark serpent** that feeds on dust—modern **South Mountain**’s **Tiao serpents**, which swallow deer, belong to this kind. There is **Wu Mountain**, to its west the **Yellow Bird**. The **Emperor’s Medicines**, eight in number, are stored here—the divine elixirs of the **Celestial Emperor**. The Yellow Bird on Wu Mountain oversees this dark serpent, acting as its guardian.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands **Untended Mountain**, where the Xing River reaches its end. There is a man with three bodies; **Emperor Jun**’s wife, **E Huang**, gave birth to this **Three-Bodied Nation**, likely the origin of their descendants. They bear the **Yao surname**, eat millet, and employ four birds. *Yao* is Shun’s clan name.\n\nThere is a square abyss, its four corners all connected. To the north, it joins the Black Waters; to the south, the Great Wilderness—*shu* here means \"to link.\" Its northern side is called **Shaohe Abyss**, its southern side **Cong Abyss** (*cong* pronounced like the horse *cong*). This is where **Shun bathed**, where he once cleansed himself in its waters.\n\nThere is also **Cheng Mountain**, where the **Sweet Waters** reach their end. The Sweet Waters issue from **Gan Mountain**, their flow culminating here. There is the **Ji Yu Nation**, descendants of **Zhuan Xu**, who eat millet. This land’s people are the progeny of Zhuan Xu. There is the **Feathered People’s Nation**, whose inhabitants are all born with feathers. There is the **Egg-Born Nation**, whose people all hatch from eggs—meaning they are oviparous.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands **Bujiang Mountain**, where the Black Waters reach their end. The Black Waters issue from Kunlun Mountain. There is also **Jia Mountain**, from which the **Qi River** flows. Further, there is **Yan Mountain**, and **Dengbei Mountain** (also called **Dengbao Mountain**, where the multitude of shamans ascend and descend). There is **Jiejie Mountain** (*jie* pronounced like the *qi* in \"contract\"). There is **Pu Mountain**, from which the **Li River** flows, and **Wei Mountain** (*Wei* pronounced like the *wei* in \"Wei Ao\"). To its west lies cinnabar; to its east, jade.\n\nFurther south is a mountain from which the **Piao River** flows (*piao* pronounced like \"whirlwind\"). There is **Wei Mountain** and **Cui Mountain**—this mountain is home to the **kingfisher bird**. There is the **Ying People’s Nation**, of the **Yu surname**, who eat millet. There are also people who feed on tree leaves.\n\nThere is the **Land of Immortals**, of the **A surname**, who eat the **sweetwood**—the sweetwood being the **tree of immortality**, whose consumption prevents aging. Within the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Qu Chi** (\"Departing Convulsions\"). To the south, it bears fruit; to the north, it does not—*qu chi* is pronounced like the *chi* in \"wind convulsions,\" though its meaning is unclear.\n\nOn an islet in the Southern Sea dwells a spirit with a human face, wearing two azure serpents as earrings, named **Bu Ting Hu Yu** (a spirit’s name). There is a spirit named **Yin Yin Hu**, called **Yin Hu** in the south and **Hu Min** by the boastful winds—it has two names. It dwells at the southern pole, controlling the entry and exit of winds.\n\nThere is **Xiang Mountain**, and **Chongyin Mountain** (\"Double Shade\"). There are people who eat beasts, called **Ji Li**. Emperor Jun fathered Ji Li, hence the name **Ji Li Nation**. There is **Min Abyss** (*min* pronounced like \"dusk\"). **Shaohao** fathered **Bei Fa**, who descended to dwell in Min Abyss.\n\nThere are square waters named **Jun Altar**. The waters resemble an earthen altar, hence the name **Shun Altar**. There is the **Zai People’s Nation**. Emperor Shun fathered **Wu Yin**, who descended to dwell here, known as the **Wu Zai People**. The Wu Zai People bear the **Pan surname**, eat grain, yet neither spin nor weave their clothing, nor sow nor reap their food—meaning they have natural cloth and self-growing grains. What is sown is called *jia*; what is reaped is called *se*.\n\nHere are birds that sing and dance: the **luan bird** sings of its own accord, the **phoenix** dances of its own accord. Here gather a hundred beasts, living in herds. Here the hundred grains converge.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Rongtian** (\"Heaven-Fusing\"), where the sea’s waters enter from the south. There is a man called **Zaochi** (\"Chisel-Teeth\"), whom **Yi** slew—meaning Yi shot and killed him. There is **Yu Mountain**. There is the **Yu People’s Nation** (*yu* pronounced like the same). They bear the **Sang surname**, eat millet, and feed on **yu**—*yu* being the **short fox**, resembling a turtle, which spits sand to shoot people, causing illness and death. This mountain produces them, hence its name.\n\nThere is a man drawing a bow, shooting a yellow serpent, named the **Yu Archer**. There is **Song Mountain**, home to a red serpent called the **Green Serpent**. A tree grows upon this mountain, named **maple**—the maple is what **Chi You**’s shackles transformed into after Chi You was captured by the Yellow Emperor, bound, and executed. His discarded bonds became this tree, now called the maple—today’s **fengxiang tree**.\n\nThere is a man with tiger’s teeth and a tiger’s tail, named **Zu Zhuang’s Corpse** (*zu* pronounced like the *za* in \"wild pear\"). There are little people, the **Jiao Yao Nation**, of the **Ji surname**, all three *chi* tall, who eat **fine grains**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **□Tu Mountain** (*tu* pronounced like \"rot\"). The **Azure Waters** reach their end here. The Azure Waters issue from Kunlun Mountain. There is **Cloud Rain Mountain**, upon which grows a tree named **Le** (\"Joy\"). **Yu** attacked Cloud Rain—*gong* here means \"to fell its forests.\"\n\nHere the **Redstone** gives birth to Joy—its roots yellow, branches crimson, leaves azure. The **August Ones** gather medicine from it, for its blossoms and fruits are all divine drugs.\n\nThere is a land called **Zhuan Xu**, where **Bo Fu** is born, who eats millet. There is a land of the **You** surname (*you* pronounced like the *yu* in \"citron\"). There is **Tiao Mountain**. There is **Zong Mountain**. There is **Xing Mountain**. There is **He Mountain**. There is **Chen Zhou Mountain**. There is **Dong Zhou Mountain**. There is **Whitewater Mountain**, from which the **Whitewater** issues, giving rise to the **White Abyss**, where the disciples of **Kun Wu** bathe. **Kun Wu** is the title of an ancient king. The *Pronunciation and Meaning* states: **Kun Wu** is a mountain name, whose streams yield fine metal. The two accounts differ, and none can discern which is correct.\n\nThere is a man named **Zhang Hong**, who fishes upon the sea. Within the sea lies the **Land of Zhang Hong**; some say it is the land of the **Qi Gong** people, though this is doubtful. He eats fish and commands four birds. There is another man, beaked like a bird and winged, who enters the sea to catch fish.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness there is a man named **Huan Tou**. **Gun**’s wife was **Shi Jing**, and **Shi Jing**’s son was **Yan Rong**, who begot **Huan Tou**. **Huan Tou** has the face of a man, the beak of a bird, and wings. He eats fish from the sea and walks with the aid of his wings, for though he has wings, they cannot bear him in flight—he relies on them only as a staff. He eats **white millet**, **broomcorn millet**, and **black millet**. *The Master Guan* speaks of the crops suited to the land, saying: its grains are **broomcorn**, **chaste tree**, and **black millet**, all kinds of millet. *Ju* is black millet; the modern character adds the \"grain\" radical. It has three pronunciations: *qi*, *ju*, and *qiu*. There is the **Land of Huan Tou**.\n\nThe **Divine Yao**, **Divine Ku**, and **Divine Shun** are buried upon **Yue Mountain**, which is **Di Mountain**. Here dwell **patterned cowries**, **Li Yu**, **□ Jiu**, **hawk merchants**, **Yan Wei**, **flesh that sees**, bears, brown bears, tigers, and leopards. There is a tree with crimson branches and azure blossoms, bearing black fruit.\n\nThere is **Shen Mountain**. Within the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Heaven’s Terrace** (*a lofty mountain*), into which the sea’s waters flow.\n\nBeyond the **Eastern Sea**, between the **Sweet Waters**, lies the **Land of Xi He**. There is a woman named **Xi He**, who bathes the sun in the **Sweet Abyss**. **Xi He** is she who, at the dawn of heaven and earth, presided over the sun and moon. Thus *The Oracle of Qi* says: \"The verdant vastness of Hollow Mulberry, the Eight Poles now spread wide—then came **Xi He**, who governs the sun and moon, whose duty is their ingress and egress, creating dusk and dawn.\" It also says: \"Gazing upon the heavens above, now bright, now dark, there is the child of **Xi He**, emerging from **Yang Valley**.\" Therefore, **Yao** established the office of **Xi He** to oversee the four seasons, and her descendants became this land. They fashion images of the sun and moon and tend to them, bathing and revolving them within the **Sweet Waters** to mimic their rising from **Yang Valley** and setting in **Yu Abyss**—so the world does not lose its proper order.\n\n**Xi He** is the wife of **Di Jun** and mother of the **Ten Suns**. She bore ten children, each named after a sun, hence the saying \"mother of the Ten Suns,\" meaning ten in number.\n\nThere is **Yi You Mountain**, upon which grows the **Sweet Ancestor**, its branches and leaves all crimson, its leaves yellow, blossoms white, and fruit black. To the east grows the **Sweet Blossom**, its trunk and branches all crimson, its leaves yellow. There are **azure horses** and **crimson horses**, called the **Three Bays**. There is **flesh that sees**. There are little people called **Fungus Folk** (*jun* pronounced like the *jun* in \"morning fungus\").\n\nThere is **Southkind Mountain**, where dwell **leftover jades**, **azure horses**, the **Three Bays**, **flesh that sees**, **Sweet Blossoms**, and the **Hundred Grains**.\n\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Fifteen ends*\n*Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Sixteen*\n\nGuo Pu’s Commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Great Wilderness West*\n\nBeyond the Northwest Sea, at the corner of the Great Wilderness, stands a mountain that does not join, called **Unjoined Child**. The *Huainanzi* states: \"Of old, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne. In rage, he struck **Unjoined Mountain**. The heavenly cords snapped, the earthly pillars broke.\" Thus, this mountain remains cleft and incomplete.\n\nTwo yellow beasts guard it.\n\nThere is a body of water called **Cold-and-Heat Waters**. To its west lies **Damp Mountain**, and to its east, **Screen Mountain** (*Mu*, pronounced like the *mo* in \"screen\").\n\nThere is **Yu’s Attack on Gonggong’s State Mountain**. It is said that Yu attacked Gonggong’s state and slew its ministers here, suppressing them at this mountain. The *Qi Shi* states: \"Gonggong had the face of a man, the body of a serpent, and crimson hair. He ruled a state called **Refined Scholar**, and was a son of Zhuanxu.\" It is also said that he descended from the Gaoyang clan.\n\nThere are ten spirits called **Nüwa’s Intestines**, transformed into gods and dwelling in the **Chestnut Expanse** wilds. Nüwa was an ancient goddess and sovereign, with the face of a human and the body of a serpent, who transformed seventy times in a single day. Her intestines became these spirits. **Chestnut Expanse** is the name of the wilds. (*Jiao*, pronounced like the *gua* in \"melon.\") They dwell athwart the path, said to be severed remnants.\n\nThere is a being named **Stone Yi**, whose wind is called **Wei** (or *Ben*, in some versions). He dwells in the northwest corner, governing the length of days and nights, overseeing the measurements of the sun and moon’s shadows.\n\nThere is a five-colored bird with a crest, called the **Mad Bird**. The *Erya* states: \"The *wangliang* is this bird.\"\n\nThere is **Great Ford’s Long Mountain**, and the **Land of the White People**.\n\nBeyond the Northwest Sea, east of the **Red Waters**, lies the **Land of Long Victory**, where people’s strides span five feet.\n\nThere is the **State of Western Zhou**, of the Ji clan, who eat grains.\n\nThere is a man plowing, named **Shu Jun**. **Di Jun** begot **Ji** (also called **Ku**; Ku’s second consort bore **Hou Ji**). Ji descended with the Hundred Grains. Ji’s younger brother was **Tai** (*Tai*, pronounced like the *tai* in \"fetus\"). **Xi** begot **Shu Jun**, who took his father’s and Ji’s place to sow the Hundred Grains, thus beginning agriculture.\n\nThere is the **Red State’s Wife Clan**, and **Twin Mountains**.\n\nThe waters of the Western Sea lie within the Great Wilderness.\n\nThere is **Square Mountain**, upon which grows a verdant tree called the **Cabinet-Frame Pine** (*Juge* pine; *ju* pronounced like the *ju* in \"measure\"). The sun and moon enter here to rest.\n\nBeyond the Western Sea, west of the **Red Waters**, lies the **Land of the Ancestral People**, who eat grains and command the four birds.\n\nThere is the **State of the Northern Di**, descended from **Shi Jun**, grandson of the **Yellow Emperor**. **Shi Jun** begot the Northern Di.\n\nThere is **Mang Mountain**. There is **Cassia Mountain**. There is **Yao Mountain**, so named for its abundance of cassia and *yao* trees. Upon it dwells one called **Crown Prince Long Qin**. **Zhuan Xu** begot **Lao Tong**—*The Genealogies* states: \"Zhuan Xu took a wife from the Tengfen clan, called **Lady Lu**, who bore **Lao Tong**.\" **Lao Tong** begot **Zhu Rong** (also called **Chong Li**), who served as the **Fire Minister** under **High Lord Xin** and was titled **Zhu Rong**. **Zhu Rong** begot **Crown Prince Long Qin**, who dwelled on **Yao Mountain** and first created the music of the wind. He composed the melody *Retained Wind*.\n\nThere are three five-colored birds: one called the **Phoenix Crow**, one the **Luan Bird**, and one the **Fenghuang**.\n\nThere is a creature shaped like a hare, its torso bare where it is bare—its skin’s blue-green hue renders it invisible, exposing only its bare flesh. It resembles an ape, its movements slow, much like a simian.\n\nIn the heart of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Fengju Jade Gate**, where the sun and moon descend. There are the **Spirit Mountain**, and the shamans **Wu Xian**, **Wu Ji**, **Wu Xi**, **Wu Peng**, **Wu Gu**, **Wu Zhen**, **Wu Qi**, **Wu [missing character]**, **Wu Xie**, and **Wu Luo**—ten shamans who ascend and descend this peak, where all the hundred herbs abide. It is said that the multitude of shamans gather upon this mountain to harvest them.\n\nThere are the **Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West**, the **Sea Mountain**, and the **Gorge Mountain**—all renowned peaks of the vast emptiness. There is the **Land of Fertility**, so named for its rich and abundant soil. The **Fertile People** dwell here, feasting upon the eggs of the **Phoenix Crow** and drinking the **Sweet Dew**. Whatever flavors they desire, all are present; whatever tastes they crave, none are absent.\n\nHere grow the **Sweet Blossoms**, the **Sweet Hawthorn**, the **White Willows**, the **Sight-Flesh**, the **Three Steeds**, the **Xuan Gui** (a kind of jade), the **Yao Bi** (precious jade), the **White Wood** (a tree with pure white bark, now known as the **Southern Veined Wood**, which is also black), the **White Cinnabar**, the **Green Cinnabar**, and the **Black Cinnabar**. *The* **Ying of the Filial Classic** *states: \"When a ruler’s virtue reaches the mountains and hills, Black Cinnabar emerges.\"* Thus, these are distinct minerals, just as white and black are distinguished. There is also **Silver Iron**.\n\nThe **Luan Birds** sing of their own accord, and the **Phoenixes** dance spontaneously. Here, a hundred beasts gather and dwell together—this is called the **Wilds of the Fertile People**. There are three **Azure Birds**, with red heads and black eyes. One is called the **Great Harmony Crow**, another the **Lesser Li**—both are messengers of the **Queen Mother of the West**.\n\nThere is the **Terrace of the Xuanyuan**, where archers dare not face west, out of reverence for the **Terrace of Xuanyuan**—a homage to the **August Emperor**.\n\nIn the Great Wilderness lies **Dragon Mountain**, where the sun and moon descend. There are three turbid waters called the **Three Tossings**, which the **Kun Wu** consume. *The* **Tale of King Mu** *states: \"The Taoshui River, consumed by the turbid Rong people, belongs to this same category.\"*\n\nThere is a figure clad in blue, sleeves covering its face—*袂 (sleeves), pronounced as \"zhi\"*—named the **Corpse of the Queen**. There is the **Land of Women**. When the lords of the **Land of Fertile Ancestors** reached its easternmost border and inquired of its elders, they were told: \"Our people once set sail to fish and were blown by the wind for dozens of days. To the east, we sighted a land amidst the great sea where only women dwell, with no men—this is that very land.\"\n\nThere are the **Peach Mountain**, the **Yu Mountain**, the **Cassia Mountain**, and the **Dry Earth Mountain**. There is the **Land of Husbands**, where no women reside. There is the **Mountain of Yan Zhou**. A five-colored bird pecks at the heavens, gaping to exhale upon the sky—it is called the **Singing Bird**. Here, the winds carry a hundred kinds of music, song, and dance. It is said that a hundred varieties of performing arts and dances all possess their own wind-borne melodies.\n\nThere is the **Land of Xuanyuan**, whose people have human faces and serpentine bodies. South of the **Jiang Mountains**, dwelling in the mountains is auspicious—this refers to the edge of the **Barren Mountains**. Those who reside in the mountains are said to be free from misfortune and calamity. The long-lived may reach eight hundred years, while some endure for thousands.\n\nIn the shallows of the Western Sea dwell divine beings with human faces and avian bodies, entwined with two green serpents and treading upon two red serpents—they are called the **Yan Zi**.\n\nIn the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called the **Moon Mountain**, the **Pole of Heaven**. The **Gate of Heaven of Wu Ji** is where the sun and moon descend. There is a divine being with a human face but no arms, its two feet bent backward to attach to its head—it is called the **Xu**. *Xu* signifies wailing.\n\n**Zhuan Xu** begot **Lao Tong**, and **Lao Tong** begot **Chong** and **Li**. *The* **Genealogies** *states: \"Lao Tong took a wife from the Genshui clan, called Jiao Fu, who bore Chong and Li.\"* The Emperor commanded **Chong** to ascend to heaven and **Li** to descend to earth. In ancient times, humans and spirits intermingled without order, so **Zhuan Xu** appointed the **Southern Regulator** to govern the heavens and the affairs of the spirits, and the **Great Regulator Li** to govern the earth and the affairs of humanity. **Chong** indeed ascended to heaven, and **Li** indeed governed the earth—though the details of their offerings remain unclear. From this descent to earth arose **Ye**, who dwells in the westernmost reaches, overseeing the movements of the sun, moon, and the hundred [celestial bodies]. It is said that he observes the degrees and lodgings of the sun, moon, and stars.\n\nThere is a figure with arms bent backward, called the **Heavenly Warden**. There is a **Red Corpse**, also called the **Warden**. There is a woman bathing the moon. **Di Jun’s** wife, **Chang Xi**, bore twelve moons—this is the origin of their bathing. Together with **Xi He**, she bathes the sun and moon.\n\nThere is the **Mountain of Black Cinnabar**, which produces **Black Cinnabar**. There is a five-colored bird with a human face and hair. Here dwell the **Azure Bird**, the **Yellow Bird**, and the **Ao Bird**—*Ao, pronounced as \"ao\"*—whose gathering of blue and yellow foretells the fall of a nation.\n\nThere is a pool called the **Meng Yi’s Attack on Zhuan Xu’s Pool**. **Meng Yi** is a person’s name.\n\nIn the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Chen Ao**—*Ao, pronounced as \"ao\"*—a colossal peak where the sun and moon descend. There is a beast with heads on both sides, called the **Ping Feng**—that is, the **Bing Feng**, a name that shifts in pronunciation.\n\nThere is the **Gorge Mountain**, the **Golden Gate Mountain**, where dwells one named the **Corpse of Yellow Ji**. There are the **Biwing Birds**. There is a white bird with azure wings, a yellow tail, and a black beak—an extraordinary bird.\n\nThere is a red dog called the **Heavenly Dog**; wherever it descends, war follows. *The* **Book of Zhou** *states: \"Where the Heavenly Hound halts, the land is scorched. Its radiance flies through the heavens as a meteor, stretching dozens of yards long, swift as the wind, resounding like thunder, flashing like lightning.\"* The howling of the **Heavenly Dog** once passed through the lands of **Wu** and **Chu**, dividing the wilds of the seven states.\n\nSouth of the Western Sea, beyond the **Flowing Sands**, behind the **Red Waters**, and before the **Black Waters**, stands a mountain called the **Kunlun Mound**. There dwells a divine being with a human face and a tiger’s body, adorned with patterns and a tail, all marked in white—its tail is speckled with white. Below it lies the abyss of **Weak Waters**, encircling the mountain, whose waters cannot even bear a goose feather. Beyond it rises the **Mountain of Blazing Fire**, where anything that touches it instantly ignites.\n\nNow, ten thousand *li* east of **Funan**, there lies the kingdom of **Qibo**. Five thousand *li* east of Qibo lies the kingdom of **Fire Mountain**. Though thunder and rain assail the mountain, its flames never cease. Within the fire dwell white rats, which at times emerge along the mountainside to seek food. When captured by humans, their fur is woven into cloth—this is the famed **fire-washed cloth** of today, a product of such fire mountains.\n\nThere is a being with tiger’s fangs worn as a crown and a tail dwelling in a cave, known as the **Queen Mother of the West**. The *Hetu Jade Tablet* also states: \"The Queen Mother of the West resides on **Kunlun Mountain**.\" The *Classic of Mountains: The West* says: \"The Queen Mother of the West dwells on **Jade Mountain**.\" The *Tale of King Mu* records: \"Thus, he inscribed his name upon the stone of **Yanshan**, calling it the Mountain of the Queen Mother of the West.\" Therefore, though the Queen Mother of the West makes Kunlun her palace, she also has separate chambers and wandering retreats, never confined to a single mountain. Hence, chroniclers each describe what they have witnessed.\n\nThis mountain possesses all things under heaven. In the midst of the **Great Wilderness**, there is a mountain called **Changyang**, where the sun and moon set. There lies the kingdom of **Hanhuan**, where two figures dwell: **Nüji** and **Nümie**, who hold eels and sacrificial stands. The kingdom of **Shouma**—the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: \"In the western reaches lies Shouma, and to the north, **Dadong**.\" There are two others: **Nanyue** and **Quzhou**, named **Nüqian**. Nüqian bore **Jige**, who in turn begot Shouma. Shouma stands upright without shadow and shouts without echo, for his form and *qi* differ from those of ordinary men. The *Biographies of the Immortals* says: \"Xuan Su, also called Yuan Jing.\" Here, the heat is so intense that none may approach, for its scorching blaze would slay a man.\n\nThere is a headless figure wielding shield and spear, called the **Corpse of Yougeng**—akin to the **Corpse of Xingtian**. Thus, when **Cheng Tang** vanquished **Xia Jie** at **Zhang Mountain**, he severed Yougeng’s head from his front. Though decapitated, Yougeng stood upright, fleeing his guilt to evade punishment, and descended upon **Wushan**. He concealed himself in Wushan, which now lies in **Wuxian County** of **Jianping**. There is one named **Wu Hui**, whose son **Zi Qi** had no right arm—this is **Qigong**. Wu Hui was the younger brother of **Zhurong**, the fire minister.\n\nThere is the kingdom of **Gaishan**, where grows a tree with red bark, green branches, and verdant leaves, called the **Zhu Tree**—or sometimes the **Sanqi Tree**. There is also the **One-Armed People**. Beneath the North Pole, too, dwell one-legged men, as seen in the *Hetu Jade Tablet*. In the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Great Wilderness Mountain**, where the sun and moon set. There is a three-faced being, a son of **Zhuanxu**, with three faces and one arm—his name is **Qi**, and he lacks a right arm. The three-faced man does not die, for his head bears a\n\n**Mountain Records of the Classic of Mountains and Seas, Scroll Seventeen**\n*Guo Pu’s Commentary*\n**The Classic of the Great Wilderness: North**\n\nBeyond the northeast sea, amid the Great Wilderness, between the waters of the River, lies **Fuyu Mountain**, where **Emperor Zhuanxu** and his nine consorts are buried. This is likely a tomb built according to the customs of a foreign land.\n\nHere abound **long-lasting turtles**, **patterned cowries**, **liyu birds**, **luan birds**, **phoenixes**, and creatures great and small—all things are fully present. **Azure birds**, **lang birds**, **dark birds**, **yellow birds**, **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, **brown bears**, **yellow serpents**, **flesh that sees**, **xuangui jade**, and **yaobi jade** all emerge from **Weiyu Mountain**, which lies at its edge.\n\nThere is a mound, three hundred *li* in circumference. South of the mound stands **Emperor Jun’s Bamboo Grove**, where the bamboo is so large a single segment may serve as a boat. South of the bamboo grove lies a crimson marsh, its waters dyed red, called **Fengyuan**—*feng* meaning \"great crimson.\" There are three mulberry trees without branches, each a hundred *ren* tall to the south.\n\nWest of the mound lies **Chenyuan**, where the customs of **Zhuanxu’s Hu Buyu Kingdom** persist—a land later known only by name. Today, the small tongues of the Hu and Yi peoples all speak thus. They bear clan names and eat millet.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Bu Xian**. There lies the kingdom of **Sushen**. Today, the land of Sushen lies over three thousand *li* from Liaodong, where its people dwell in caves, wear no clothing, and clothe themselves in pigskins. In winter, they anoint their bodies with grease, several *fen* thick, to ward off wind and cold. Their people are all skilled in crafting red bows, four *chi* long and exceedingly strong. Their arrows are made of *hu* wood, one *chi* and eight *cun* long, with arrowheads of green stone—these are the arrows received by Marquis Chi of Chen in the Spring and Autumn period. In the second year of the Taixing era of Jin, Governor Cui Kun of Pingzhou dispatched his aide Gao Hui to present bows and arrows of the Sushen people, whose arrowheads were made of bone. When asked, they said these were obtained through trade with inland kingdoms. Today, it is called the **Yiling Kingdom**, which produces fine sable and red jade—perhaps these come from the outer sea. The *Book of Later Han* refers to it as the **Yilou Kingdom**.\n\nThere are **fei zhi**, creatures with four wings. *Fei* is pronounced *zhi* in another reading. There are also insects with the heads of beasts and the bodies of serpents, called **qin insects**—a kind of serpent. There is a man called the **Elder**. There is the **Kingdom of the Elder**, whose people bear the clan name Li and eat millet.\n\nThere is a great green serpent with a yellow head that devours deer. Today, in the south, the python also eats deer, and deer belong to the same kind as the *tang* beast. There is **Yu Mountain**. There is **Xuan Gun’s Attack on Chengzhou Mountain**—both mountains are named after their legends.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Hengtian**. There is **Xianmin Mountain**. There is a **pan tree** a thousand *li* in extent. There is the kingdom of **Shu Chu**—*chu* is pronounced *gan*, or *chu* in another reading. They are descendants of **Zhuanxu**, with millet for heads, and they employ four beasts: **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, and **brown bears**. There is a black creature resembling a bear, called the **zhu zhu**—or sometimes written as *lang*, pronounced *xi*.\n\nThere is the kingdom of **Qi**, of the Jiang clan, which employs **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, and **brown bears**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Guang Kan’s Great Feng Mountain**, where the **River** and the **Ji** enter, flowing north into the sea. After the River and Ji empty into the sea, they re-emerge beyond the sea in this mountain. To its northwest lies **Yu’s Accumulated Stones**, also called **Qingyang Mountain**.\n\nThere is **Shun Mountain**, from which the **Shun River** flows. There is the kingdom of **Shizhou**. There is **Cinnabar Mountain**, which yields pure cinnabar. The *Bamboo Annals* state: \"He Jia conquered and obtained a mountain of cinnabar.\" Today, cinnabar is also mined from mountains and earthen caves.\n\nThere is a great marsh a thousand *li* in extent, where the **Zhang Bird** sheds its feathers. The *Tale of King Mu* says: \"Arriving at the vast plains, where flying birds shed their feathers, he hunted birds and beasts, taking the finest specimens, and loaded a hundred chariots with feathers.\" The *Bamboo Annals* also records: \"King Mu marched north, traversing a thousand *li* of flowing sands, amassing feathers for a thousand *li*—all referring to this marsh.\"\n\nThere is the **Kingdom of the Hairy People**, whose inhabitants all have human faces and bodies covered in hair. They bear the clan name Yi, eat millet, and employ four beasts. **Yu** begot the kingdom of **Jun**, **Jun** begot **Yi Lai**, **Yi Lai** begot **Xun Jia**—*jia* is pronounced *dan xia*. **Xun Jia** killed the **Chuo people**—*Chuo* being their name. The Emperor, moved by this, secretly established a kingdom for them, concealing its origins. These are the Hairy People.\n\nThere is the **Kingdom of the Pendulous-Eared**, of the Ren clan, whose people have large ears that hang down, resting on their shoulders. The Vermilion Bird’s **Dian Er** carvings depict ears reaching the shoulders, imitating these people. **Yu Hao’s son** eats grain. It is said that on the islets of the Northern Sea, they cultivate millet to sustain themselves—this refers to **Yu Qiang**.\n\nThere is a spirit with a human face and a bird’s body, wearing two green serpents as earrings and treading upon two red serpents, named **Yu Qiang**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **North Pole’s Heavenly Accumulation**—*ji* is pronounced *yi*—where the northern waters of the sea flow. There is a spirit with nine human heads and a bird’s body, named the **Nine Phoenixes**. There is another spirit that holds serpents in its mouth and grasps serpents in its hands, with the head of a tiger, the body of a man, four hooves, and long elbows, named **Qiang Liang**—also among the dreaded beasts.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Chengdu’s Loaded Heaven**. There is a man who wears two yellow serpents as earrings and holds two yellow serpents in his hands, named **Kua Fu**. **Houtu** begot **Xin**, **Xin** begot **Kua Fu**. Kua Fu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow and pursued it to **Yu Valley**—the ravine where the sun is said to set.\n\nHere now is the translation:\n\n---\n\nNow it is called Yu. He was about to drink from the Yellow River, but it was not enough. He then raced toward the Great Marsh, yet before he arrived, he perished here—dying of thirst. After **Yinglong** had slain **Chiyou**, he also killed **Kua Fu**. Above it is said that Kua Fu, overestimating his strength, competed with the sun and died; here it is again said that he was slain by Yinglong. His death has no fixed account, for events are recorded as they arise, making clear that his transformations are boundless and beyond measure.\n\nYinglong then departed to dwell in the south, and so the south has abundant rain. It speaks of dragons as creatures of water, for like attracts like. There is the **Land of the Gutless**, which belongs to the **Ren** clan. Its people are tall. They have no heirs, and they eat fish. *Ji* is also written as *qi*, referring to the intestines. **Gonggong’s** minister was named **Xiangyao**—also called **Xiangliu**, with the name’s sound shifting in speech. He had nine heads and a serpent’s body, coiling upon himself, meaning he was twisted and spiraled. He fed upon nine mountains, speaking of his greed and savagery. Wherever he dwelled, it became barren—*ni* and *ya*, like the sound of spitting and choking, meaning he stopped up the land. Thus it became a source of marshes, speaking of his great strength. His misfortune brought suffering, for his qi was harsh and fierce. No beast could inhabit the same place, speaking of the fear he inspired.\n\nWhen **Yu** dammed the floodwaters, he killed Xiangyao. Yu blocked the vast deluge, drowning him in the process. His blood was foul and reeking, unable to nurture grain, and his land was waterlogged, unfit for habitation. It speaks of how his fat and blood flowed and pooled into abysses. Yu dammed it, piling earth three times and sinking three times—speaking of Yu’s earthen barriers and the serpent’s collapse into the soil. He then turned it into a pool. The land was parched, so the **Di** emperors took advantage of this to build a terrace, for low ground is suitable for accumulation. Thus the many emperors came together here to construct the terrace. It lies north of **Kunlun**.\n\nThere is a mountain called **Yue Mountain**, where **Xun bamboo** grows—great bamboo. In the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Buju**, where the northern sea waters flow in. There is **Xikun Mountain**, where **Gonggong’s Terrace** stands. Archers dare not face north toward it, speaking of the fear it inspires. There is a person clad in blue-green robes, named **Ba**, the daughter of the **Yellow Emperor**—*ba* is pronounced like *drought*. When Chiyou forged weapons to attack the Yellow Emperor, the Yellow Emperor commanded Yinglong to strike him in the wilds of **Jizhou**—Jizhou being the central land. The Yellow Emperor also trained tigers, leopards, bears, and brown bears to battle **Yan Di** in the wilds of **Banyuan**, annihilating him. See the *Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\nYinglong stored up water, while Chiyou summoned the **Wind Earl** and **Rain Master**, bringing forth a great storm. The Yellow Emperor then sent down the heavenly maiden **Ba**, and the rain ceased, allowing him to slay Chiyou. Ba could not return above, and wherever she dwelled, there was no rain, for the drought’s qi remained. **Shu Jun** spoke of this to the emperor, who later banished her to the north of the **Red Waters**, exiling her far away. Shu Jun then became the **Field Ancestor**, overseeing the fields. As the *Book of Songs* says: *“The Field Ancestor is divine.”* Ba was at times lost, for she feared being driven away. Those who wished to expel her commanded the Field Ancestor to proceed northward toward the water’s position. First, they cleared the waterways, dredging and connecting ditches and channels. It speaks of how driving her away would bring rain, so they first improved the waterways—this is the origin of today’s practice of expelling Ba.\n\nThere is a people who are eating fish, named the **Land of the Deep-Eyed**. They belong to the **Xi** clan and eat fish. They are also of the **Hu** kind, though their eyes are deeply set, for the Yellow Emperor’s time reached them. There is **Zhong Mountain**, where a woman clad in blue-green robes is named **Xian**, the maiden of the **Red Waters**—a divine woman.\n\nIn the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Rongfu Mountain**, where the waters flow in order. There is a people named the **Dog Rong**. The Yellow Emperor begot **Miaolong**, Miaolong begot **Rongwu**, Rongwu begot **Bianming**, Bianming begot the **White Dog**, and the White Dog had two dogs, male and female, meaning they paired among themselves. Thus they became the Dog Rong, who harm and devour. There is a red beast there, formless and headless, named **Rongxuanwang’s Corpse**—the spirit name of the Dog Rong.\n\nThere is a mountain called **Qizhou Mountain**, also known as **Zeng Mountain**—*zeng* is pronounced *qian*—**Xianye Mountain**, and **Yu Mountain**. There is a people with a single eye, growing in the center of their face. Another account says they belong to the **Wei** clan, descendants of **Shaohao**, and eat millet. There are the **Jiwujiwu** people of the **Ren** clan—*ji* is also written as *qi*, meaning the navel—who have no bones and eat qi and fish. It speaks of the existence of boneless people. The *Master Shi* says: *“King Xu of Xu had sinews but no bones.”*\n\nEast of the **Flowing Sands** beyond the northwest sea lies a land called **Zhonglun**, descendants of **Zhuanxu**, who eat millet. There is a land named **Laiqiu**. There is the **Land of the Dog Rong**. There is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body, also named the **Dog Rong**.\n\nNorth of the **Black Waters** beyond the northwest sea dwell winged people, named the **Miao People**—the people of the **Three Miao**. Zhuanxu begot **Huantou**, Huantou begot the Miao People, who belong to the **Li** clan. There is a mountain named **Zhang Mountain**. In the Great Wilderness stand **Heng Stone Mountain**, **Nine Yin Mountain**, and **Huiye Mountain**, upon which grows a red tree with green leaves, named **Bitter Artistry**. It stands at the western extremity of Kunlun, its leaves glowing red and illuminating the earth below.\n\nThere is the **Land of the Niu Li**. There are people without bones, the **Dang’erzi**—the Dang’er people give birth to boneless children. North of the **Red Waters** beyond the northwest sea stands **Zhangwei Mountain**. There is a spirit with a human face and a red serpent’s body, a thousand *li* in length. His eyes are straight and aligned, though the meaning of *zheng cheng* is unclear. When he closes his eyes, it is dark; when he opens them, it is bright—speaking of how his sight brings day and his closure brings night. He does not eat, does not sleep, does not rest, and summons wind and rain. It speaks of his power to invoke wind and rain. He illuminates the **Nine Yin**, shining upon the hidden depths of the Nine Yin. Thus he is called **Zhulong**. The *Li Sao* says: *“Where the sun does not reach, how does Zhulong shine?”* The *Han of the Divine* says: *“The northwest of the world is incomplete, lacking the ebb and flow of yin and yang, so there is a dragon holding the essence of fire to illuminate the midst of the Heavenly Gate.”*\n\n**Completion of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Seventeen**\n\n*Collation Notes:*\n1. *Liaoshou*: Tan’s collation reads *Shushí* (millet-eating).\n2. *The one they wish to pursue is commanded to go north to the Field Ancestor*: Tan’s collation reads *The one they wish to pursue is commanded: “Let the spirit go north.”*\n3. *There are heirs, no heirs, no people □ Ren clan*: Tan’s collation reads *There are heirs, no people; the heirless have no people of the Ren clan.*\n4. *Observing the Miao people*: Tan’s collation reads *Meat-eating.*\n5. *Qingniu* (Green Ox): Tan’s collation emends to *Men qingye* (Gate of Green Leaves).\n\n---\n\n**Guo Pu’s Commentary on the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*\n*Scroll Eighteen: The *Classic of the Regions Within the Seas***\n\nTo the east of the Eastern Sea and the corner of the Northern Sea lies a state called **Chosŏn** and **Tiandu**. Its people dwell in water. Chosŏn is today’s Lelang Commandery.\n\nThe kingdom of **Tianzhu** (India) values the **Dao** and **virtue**; it possesses written texts, gold, silver, coinage, and *stūpas* that emerge from this land. In the fourth year of the *Taixing* era of the Jin, the king of Tianzhu came to pay tribute. The **Wei people** love others. *Wei* also means \"love,\" pronounced *wēi*.\n\nWithin the Western Sea and amidst the Flowing Sands lies a state called **□shi**, pronounced *chì*. West of the Western Sea and the Flowing Sands is a state called **Fan Ye**, meaning \"overflowing.\"\n\nWest of the Flowing Sands stands **Bird Mountain**, from which three rivers flow. The three rivers issue from a single mountain. There is **yellow gold**, **xuan gui** (a precious stone), **cinnabar goods**, and **silver**, all emerging from these waters—speaking of the treasures within these streams. There is also **Huai Mountain**, from which **Good Water** flows.\n\nEast of the Flowing Sands and west of the Black Water lie the states of **Zhaoyun** and **Sizhi**.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s wife, **Leizu**, bore **Changyi**. The *Genealogies* states: “The Yellow Emperor took a daughter of the Xiling clan as wife, calling her Leizu, who bore **Qingyang** and **Changyi**.” Changyi descended to dwell by the **Ruoshui River** and begot **Hanliu**. The *Bamboo Annals* says: “Changyi descended to dwell by the Ruoshui; the *Qiandi* (Heavenly Emperor) was **Dihuang**, and **Huang** was **Hanliu**. Hanliu was **Emperor Zhuanxu**.” **Han** had a protruding head and cautious ears—*zhuóshǒu* (protruding head) and *jǐněr* (cautious ears) are unclear. His face was that of a man, his snout that of a boar, his body that of a *lin* (a mythical beast), and his hooves those of a *qutun* (a large pig). *Zhǐ* means \"feet\"; *qú* means \"cart-net,\" speaking of the tracks of his feet. The *Great Commentary* says: “As large as a *chequ* (a giant clam).” He took **Naozi**, called the **River Woman**, and begot **Zhuan**. The *Genealogies* says: “Zhuanxu’s mother was a daughter of the Zhuoshan clan, named **Changtiao**.”\n\nBetween the Flowing Sands and the Black Water stands a mountain called **Mountain of No Death**, which is **Fuqiu**. East of **Huashan** and the **Qingshui River** is a mountain called **Zhaoshan**. There is a man there, **Bogao**. *Bogao* is an immortal. Bogao ascends and descends here, reaching the heavens—speaking of his soaring through the clouds to this mountain.\n\nIn the southwest sea, between the Black Water, there is a mountain called **Mountain of No Death**, which is also **Fuwu**. East of **Huashan** and the **Qingshui River** is a mountain called **Zhaoshan**. There is a man there, **Bogao**. *Again mentioning Bogao.* Bogao ascends and descends here, reaching the heavens. *The preceding forty characters appear to be repeated.*\n\nBetween the southwest sea and the Black Water lies the **Duguang Wilds**, where **Houji** is buried. Its city is three hundred *li* square, said to be the center of heaven and earth, where the **Plain Girl** emerges. The *Li Sao* says: *“Crossing the Duguang Wilds, he cried out to the straight cypress.”* There are **gaoshu** (fat beans), **gaodao** (fat rice), **gaoshu** (fat millet), and **gaoji** (fat sorghum)—speaking of fine grains smooth as fat. The *Outer Commentary* says: “The son of **Gaoliang** is **beans**.” The hundred grains grow of themselves; in winter, they are sown and played like a *qin*. *Bo* means \"to sow\" or \"to plant,\" a local expression. The **luan birds** sing of themselves, the **phoenixes** dance of themselves. The **ling shou** bears fruit—*ling shou* is a tree resembling bamboo with branches and nodes. The grasses and trees gather here, assembling in this place. Here dwell the hundred beasts, gathering in herds. *Yuan* means \"here,\" where they herd together. This grass neither dies in winter nor summer.\n\nBetween the Black Water and the Qingshui River within the Southern Sea stands a tree called the **Ruomu**, with red bark and green leaves. *Ruoshui River.* There is the state of **Yuzhong** and the state of **Liexiang**.\n\nOn **Ling Mountain**, there is a red serpent dwelling upon its trees, called the *ruan* serpent, which feeds on wood. It does not consume birds or beasts—its name sounds like \"soft and weak.\" There is the state of **Jianchang**. There are people there with bird heads, called the **Bird Clan**. In present-day texts on immortals, they are known as the **Crow Barbarians**.\n\nThere are nine mounds encircled by water, named: **Taotang’s Mound**—*Taotang* being Yao’s title; **Shude’s Mound**; **Mengying’s Mound**; **Kunwu’s Mound**—this mound abounds in metal, as the *Master Yin* says: \"the metal of Kunwu\"; **Black-and-White Mound**; **Redview Mound**; **Cansui’s Mound**; **Warrior’s Mound**—these are names of fine mountains; and **Divine Ascent Mound**, said to be where divine beings dwell.\n\nThere is a tree with green leaves, a purple stem, dark flowers, and yellow fruit, called the **Jian Tree**. It stands a hundred *ren* tall without branches, its crown bearing nine crooked boughs—*zhu* means \"bent,\" sounding like *jin*. Below, its roots twist into nine knots—*ju* means \"tangled roots,\" as the *Huainanzi* says: \"When a tree is large, its roots coil.\" Its fruit resembles hempseed, and its leaves are like those of the *mang* tree—*mang* wood resembles the wild pear. The Great Radiance once passed by here, meaning that Fuxi traversed beneath it. It was the work of the Yellow Emperor, who established governance through yielding.\n\nThere is the **Yayu**, a creature with a dragon’s head that devours human heads. It dwells in the midst of the **Weak Waters**.\n\nThere is a green beast with a human face, called the **Xingxing**. It can speak.\n\nTo the southwest lies the state of **Ba**. The present Three Ba regions are its remnants. **Taihao** begot **Xian**, Xian begot **Chengli**, Chengli begot **Houzhao**, and Houzhao was the first of the Ba people, their primal ancestor.\n\nThere is a state named **Liuhuang Xin-shi**, also known as **Feng-shi**. Its walled city spans three hundred *li* square, and dust rises from it—an image of its flourishing might.\n\nThere is **Basui Mountain**, from which the **Mian River** flows.\n\nThere is also the state of **Zhujuan**. It has black snakes with green heads that consume elephants—these are the **Ba Snakes**.\n\nIn the south dwell the **Gan Giants**, also called the **Xiaoyang** (pronounced *gan*). They have human faces, long arms, black hairy bodies, and feet that reach their heels. When they see a person, they laugh, and their lips cover their faces, allowing them to escape.\n\nThere are also black-skinned people with tiger bodies, bird feet, and two hands that grasp snakes, devouring them.\n\nThere is the **Ying** (pronounced *ying*), a creature with bird feet.\n\nThere is the **Fengshi**, a giant boar. **Yi** shot and killed it.\n\nThere is a people called the **Miao**. They are the descendants of the **Three Miao**.\n\nThere is a divine being with a human head and a serpent’s body, resembling an axle or the hub of a great chariot—a marsh spirit. It has heads on both sides, branching into two. Clad in purple robes and a bannered crown, it is called **Yanwei** or **Weiyi**. When a ruler encounters and offers it sacrifice, he will dominate the world. **Duke Huan of Qi** once came upon it while hunting in the marshes and thereafter became hegemon over the feudal lords. It was also seen by **Zhuang Zhou**, who fashioned a vermilion crown.\n\nThere is the **Luan**, which sings and dances of its own accord.\n\nThere is the **Feng Bird**, whose head bears the pattern \"Obedience,\" whose breast bears \"Benevolence,\" and whose back bears \"Righteousness\"—its appearance heralds peace under heaven.\n\nThere is a green creature like a hare, called the **Junzhuo**.\n\nThere is the **Cui Bird**.\n\nThere is the **Peacock**.\n\nWithin the **Southern Sea** stands **Mount Heng**, the Southern Marchmount. It bears **fungus cinnamon**, or some say **Mount Heng** has fungus cinnamon resembling bamboo, as recorded in the *Bencao*.\n\nThere is a mountain called **Three Son-of-Heaven’s Barrier**.\n\nIn the southern abyss of **Cangwu**, within it lies **Mount Jiuyi**, where **Shun** was buried, on the border of **Changsha** and **Lingling**. Today, it stands south of **Yingdao County** in **Lingling**. The mountain has nine streams, all resembling the original **Nine Doubts**. In ancient times, the entire region was collectively called **Cang**.\n\nWithin the **Northern Sea**, there is **Snake Mountain**, from which the **Snake River** flows, emptying eastward into the sea.\n\nThere is a five-colored bird whose flight darkens an entire village. In the seventh year of **Emperor Xuan of Han’s** reign (73 BCE), tens of thousands of five-colored birds flew over the subordinate counties—these were the same birds, called **Yi Birds**, a kind of phoenix. The *Li Sao* says: \"I harness jade serpents and ride the Yi.\"\n\nThere is **Buju Mountain**, where **Chui the Artisan** is buried to the west. Chui was the master craftsman of **Yao** (pronounced *chui*).\n\nWithin the Northern Sea, there are prisoners bound in reverse with shackles, bearing constant halberds and doubled axes—these are the assistants called **Xianggu’s Corpse**, akin to **Erfu** and **Minister Wei**.\n\n**Boyifu** begot **Xixianlong**, and Xixianlong was the first to beget the **Hu Qiang**. The Hu Qiang bear the surname **Qi**. Boyi was the teacher of **Zhuanxu**, and the present Hu Qiang are their descendants.\n\nWithin the Northern Sea stands **Mount Youdu**, from which the **Black River** flows. Upon it dwell dark birds, dark serpents, dark leopards, and dark tigers—black tigers are called **Tiao**. There are also dark foxes with bushy tails. *Peng* means \"thicket.\" The *Shuo Yuan* says: \"The thicket fox and the patterned leopard bear patterned pelts.\"\n\nThere is **Great Mystery Mountain**.\n\nThere are the **People of the Dark Mounds**, for all things on these mounds are black.\n\nThere is the **State of Great Darkness**, also called the **Dark People**, who dwell in caves and wear no clothes.\n\nThere are the **Red-Shank People**, whose legs below the knees are crimson.\n\nThere is the **Dingling State**, whose people have hair from the knees downward, horse hooves, and excel at running. The *Shi Han Shen Wu* says: \"The horse-hoofed whip their own feet and travel three hundred *li* in a day.\"\n\n**Yanling**, grandson of the **Flame Emperor**, had relations with **A Nü Yuanfu**, wife of **Wu Quan**—*tong* means \"to unite,\" implying they came together. Wu Quan was the name of a man. Yuanfu played the **zhong**, as the *Shi Ben* says: \"Wu Gou made the *qing*, and Chui made the *zhong*.\" He created the **Le Feng**, composing the music’s melodies and establishing the mountain’s form.\n\n**The Yellow Emperor** begot **Luo Ming**, Luo Ming begot **White Horse**, and White Horse was **Gun**, father of **Yu**. The *Shi Ben* says: \"The Yellow Emperor begot Changyi, Changyi begot Zhuanxu, and Zhuanxu begot Gun.\"\n\n**Emperor Jun** begot **Yu Hao**, Yu Hao begot **Yin Liang**, Yin Liang begot **Fan Yu**, who was the inventor of boats. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Gong Gu and Huo Xia made boats.\" Fan Yu begot **Xi Zhong**, Xi Zhong begot **Ji Guang**, and Ji Guang was the first to make wooden carts. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Xi Zhong made carts.\" This text says Ji Guang, showing that father and son jointly created the design, hence their interchangeable mention.\n\n**Shaohao** begot **Ban** (pronounced *ban*), who was the first to make bows and arrows. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Mou Yi made arrows, and Ze made bows.\" Since arrows are one thing, and yet both are credited with their creation, there is doubt in the account. This text says Ban made them.\n\n**Emperor Jun** bestowed upon **Yi** a vermilion bow and white-feathered arrows—a vermilion bow and stone-tipped arrows fletched with white feathers. The *Wai Zhuan* says: \"The white-feathered arrows, when seen from afar, resemble a field of *tu* (pronounced *tu*).\" He did so to aid the states below, meaning Yi used archery to eliminate calamities and assist the subordinate states. Yi was the first to relieve the myriad hardships of the lower lands, such as slaying the **Chisel-Teeth** and the **Fengshi**.\n\n**Yi of Youqiong** usurped and shot, hence his name. **Emperor Jun** begot **Yanlong**, and Yanlong was the first to make the **qin** and **se**. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Fuxi made the qin, and Shennong made the se.\"\n\nEmperor Jun had eight sons, who were the first to create song and dance.\n\nEmperor Jun begot **Shen**, Shen begot **Yijun**, and Yijun was the first to become **Chui the Artisan**, thus beginning the myriad crafts of the common people.\n\nHou Ji was the first to sow the hundred grains. Hou Ji’s grandson was named Shu Jun, who first instituted ox-plowing.\n\nGreat was this **Red Yin**—or, as some texts write, the sound *yin*. He was the first to establish a state, receiving enfeoffment as its lord.\n\nYu and Gun were the first to spread earth, leveling and stabilizing the Nine Provinces. *Spread* here means *to distribute*. The *Book* says: \"Yu distributed earth and stabilized the lofty mountains and great rivers.\"\n\nThe wife of the Flame Emperor, a daughter of the Red Waters named **Tingxian**, gave birth to **Yanju**. Yanju begot **Jiebing**, Jiebing begot **Xiqu**, and Xiqu begot **Zhurong**. Zhurong was the Fire Minister of the Gaoxin clan.\n\nZhurong descended to dwell by the Jiang River and begot **Gonggong**. Gonggong begot **Shuqi**, whose head was square—his cranium and nape were flat—and who restored the soil to its place by the Jiang River, reclaiming the land where Zhurong had once dwelled.\n\nGonggong begot **Houtu**, and Houtu begot **Ye** (pronounced *yan*). Ye’s son was **Ming**, and Ming begot the Twelve Years, twelve children named after the years.\n\nWhen the floodwaters surged to the heavens, Gun stole the **Breathing Earth** from the Supreme Emperor to dam the deluge. *Breathing Earth* refers to soil that grows without limit, thus capable of stemming the flood. As the *Divination of Qi* states: \"The surging floodwaters knew no bounds.\" Gun then used the Breathing Earth to fill and block the flood.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, the earth in Linhuai and Xu County heaved, rising six *li* in length and one *zhang* in height—an instance of such Breathing Earth. Gun acted without the Emperor’s command, so the Emperor ordered Zhurong to execute him at **Yu Jiao**.\n\nAt **Yu Jiao**, the outskirts of Yu Jiao Mountain. Gun later begot Yu. As the *Divination of Qi* states: \"Gun lay uncorrupted for three years after death; when split open with a Wu blade, he transformed into a yellow dragon.\" The Emperor then commanded Yu to complete the work of **earth-spreading**, thereby stabilizing the Nine Provinces. Gun’s achievements remained unfinished, so the Emperor again tasked Yu to fulfill his work.\n\n*Mountains and Seas Classic*, Scroll Eighteen ends here.",

      "translated_text": "**The Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n\n**Title:** *The Classic of Mountains and Seas* (*Shanhai Jing*). Eighteen scrolls. Base text sourced from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongshen* section, *Benwen* category. Collated with: Hao Yixing’s *Annotations and Commentaries on the Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Dong Ke’s *Collated and Translated Classic of Mountains and Seas*, and Tan Chenggeng’s *Punctuated and Collated Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\n**Preface to the Classic of Mountains and Seas**\n\nThose who peruse the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* invariably regard its vast and fantastical claims—its abundance of strange and wondrous, extraordinary and marvelous accounts—with skepticism. I have ventured to discuss this, saying: As Zhuangzi once observed, \"What humans know is nothing compared to what they do not know.\" This truth is manifest in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nConsider the boundless expanse of the cosmos, the teeming multitude of living beings, the interplay of yin and yang, the myriad distinctions among the ten thousand things—where qi intermingles in chaos, pressing and blending into one another, where wandering spirits and numinous anomalies take form upon encountering images, shaping themselves into mountains and rivers, adorning themselves upon trees and stones—how could such wonders ever be fully recounted?\n\nThus, all that seems discordant converges into a single resonance; all that appears chaotic coalesces into a single image. The world deems certain things \"strange,\" yet knows not why they are strange; it deems others \"not strange,\" yet knows not why they are not. Why is this so? Things do not inherently possess strangeness; they become strange only in relation to us. The strangeness, then, lies within us, not within the things themselves.\n\nThus, the Hu people, upon seeing cloth, mistake it for felt; the Yue people, upon seeing fine wool, are startled by its softness. Familiarity breeds complacency toward the commonplace, while rarity evokes wonder at the unfamiliar—this is the perennial blindness of human nature.\n\nLet me offer a few examples to illustrate: fire emerges from ice and water, while yin-aligned mice are born in scorching mountains. Those who discuss such matters find nothing strange in them, yet when they encounter the accounts in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, they deem them bizarre. This is to ignore what should be deemed strange and to marvel at what should not. To ignore what should be strange is to verge on seeing nothing as strange at all; to marvel at what should not be strange is to have never truly encountered the marvelous.\n\nIf one can discern what should not be so and what cannot be otherwise, then principle itself admits of no exceptions.\n\nExamining the *Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery* and the *Biography of King Mu*: King Mu, on his western expedition, met the Queen Mother of the West, who presented him with jade and silk as tokens of goodwill, along with brocades and woven ornaments. King Mu feasted with the Queen Mother upon the Jade Pond, exchanging poems of refined elegance. He then ascended Kunlun’s peaks, toured the Palace of the Yellow Emperor, gazed upon the ridges of Mount Zhong, and beheld the treasures of the divine rulers. He carved an inscription upon the Queen Mother’s mountain and left his mark upon the gardens of the Dark Grove. He gathered rare woods, resplendent herbs, exotic birds, and strange beasts, along with jade, precious stones, vessels of luminous beauty, golden unguents, and silver that shone like torches, bringing them back to cultivate and rear within the Central Kingdom.\n\nKing Mu rode a chariot drawn by eight steeds, with Daoli on the right and Lu’er on the left. Zaofu served as his charioteer, and Benrong as his attendant on the right. They traversed tens of thousands of miles, journeying through the renowned mountains and great rivers of the four directions, scaling and crossing them all. To the east, he ascended the halls of the Giants; to the west, he feasted in the abode of the Queen Mother; to the south, he crossed the bridge of giant turtles and alligators; to the north, he trod the thoroughfare of accumulated feathers. Only after exhausting all pleasures and delights did he return.\n\nAccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian*, King Mu obtained the steeds Daoli, Lu’er, and Hualiu, and had Zaofu drive them on his western tour, where he met the Queen Mother of the West and reveled so joyously that he forgot to return. This account aligns with the *Bamboo Annals*.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: \"King Mu wished to indulge his desires, seeking to leave his chariot tracks and horse hoofprints across the world.\" The *Bamboo Annals* records precisely this.\n\nYet scholars like Qiao Zhou, though erudite and refined, dismissed these verified historical accounts as fabrications. Sima Qian, in his \"Account of Dayuan,\" also remarked: \"Since Zhang Qian’s mission to Daxia and his exploration of the Yellow River’s source, who has truly beheld the fabled Kunlun?\" As for the strange creatures recorded in the *Basic Annals* and the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, I dare not speak of them—is this not lamentable?\n\nHad the *Bamboo Annals* not resurfaced after a thousand years to serve as evidence today, the words of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* would have nearly been discarded. Consider further: Dongfang Shuo knew the name of the *Bifang* bird; Liu Xin distinguished the corpse of the *Daoxie*; Wang Qi sought the two-faced visitor; and the people of the distant seas obtained the garment of the long-armed being. These are precise verifications, rare confirmations spanning ages.\n\nAlas! Might those who remain deluded awaken, even slightly?\n\nThus, the sagely emperors traced transformations to their utmost variations, embodying things to respond to anomalies, perceiving without obstruction, and exhaustively exploring the hidden and subtle. How profound! How mysterious!\n\nThis book spans seven dynasties and three thousand years. Though it briefly flourished during the Han, it soon fell into obscurity. The names and locations of its mountains and rivers often contain errors, differing from present-day records. With no transmitted teachings from masters, it nearly vanished. That which the Dao preserves, the world abandons—how tragic!\n\nI fear this loss, and so I have undertaken to transmit it anew, clearing its obstructions, dispelling its overgrowth, elucidating its profound subtleties, and marking its depths and shallows. May this ensure that its neglected texts do not perish from the world, its wondrous words do not fade from the present, the traces of the Xia sovereigns are not erased in times to come, and the affairs of the eight wilds remain known to future generations. Would this not be worthwhile?\n\nThe flight of a mayfly cannot compare to the soaring of a celestial roc; the swimming of minnows in a puddle cannot fathom the ascent of a crimson dragon. The courts of heaven’s music are not trodden by mere musicians; the fordless abyss is not crossed by the rhinoceros or the buffalo. Without the utmost penetration of the world, one cannot discourse on the meaning of the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nAlas! May those of broad vision and vast learning take heed.\n\n**Catalogue of the Classic of Mountains and Seas**\nEighteen scrolls in total.\nMain text: 30,919 characters.\nAnnotations: 20,350 characters.\nTotal: 51,269 characters.",

In former times, the vast floods overflowed, inundating the Central Kingdom. The people lost their footholds, clambering upon hills and nesting in trees. When Gun’s efforts proved futile, Emperor Yao commanded Yu to succeed him. Yu rode the four conveyances, following the mountains to fell trees, determining the heights of mountains and the courses of great rivers. Together with Boyi, he drove forth the birds and beasts, named the mountains and rivers, classified the grasses and trees, and distinguished the waters and soils. The Four Peaks assisted him, surveying the four directions, reaching where human traces seldom ventured and carriages and boats rarely arrived. Within, he demarcated the mountains of the five regions; without, he divided the seas of the eight directions. He recorded their treasures and marvels, the waters, soils, grasses, trees, birds, beasts, and insects native to distant lands, the abodes of qilin and phoenix, the concealments of auspicious omens, and the foreign states beyond the four seas, the strange peoples of remote domains. Yu divided the Nine Provinces, apportioned tribute according to the land, and Yi and others categorized the good and ill of creatures, compiling the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. These are all the legacy of the sagely and wise, the luminous records of antiquity. Their accounts are plain, clear, and trustworthy.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, an exotic bird was once presented. When it was fed, no other creature would eat the same food. Dongfang Shuo saw it and named the bird, further stating what it should eat—just as he had said. When asked how he knew, he replied that it was recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. During the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, a stone was struck in Shang Commandery, collapsing to reveal a stone chamber. Within was a man bound in reverse with shackles. At the time, your servant Xiu’s father, Xiang, served as Remonstrance Grandee. He identified the man as the minister of Erfu. When asked how he knew, he too cited the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, which states: “Erfu killed Yayu. The Emperor then bound him to a mountain of distant kinship, fettering his right foot and binding his hands behind his back.” The Emperor was greatly astonished. From then on, many at court marveled at the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Scholars of literature and great Confucians all studied it, deeming it extraordinary. It can be used to examine auspicious omens and strange transformations, to witness the customs and songs of distant lands and foreign peoples. Thus, the *Book of Changes* says: “To speak of the most recondite matters in the world without confusion—such is the breadth of the gentleman of wide learning.” Your servant Xiu, risking death, respectfully presents this.\n\n**Scroll One of the Classic of Mountains and Seas**",

      "translated_text": "**Account of Guo Pu**\n\n**The Southern Mountains Classic**\n\nThe first of the *Southern Mountains Classic* is called Shei Mountain.\n\nIts foremost peak is known as Mount Zhaoyao, which overlooks the Western Sea. It lies in Fushan of Shu, where the western end of the southern mountains borders the Western Sea. The mountain abounds with cassia trees, their leaves resembling those of the loquat, over two *chi* in length and several *cun* in width, with a pungent taste. Their white blossoms cluster upon the mountain peaks, remaining verdant through winter and summer, with no other trees interspersed. As the *Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals* states: “The cassia of Mount Zhaoyao.” The mountain also yields much gold and jade.\n\nThere is a kind of herb here, resembling leeks—*Pu notes: “Leeks,” pronounced *jiu*. The *Approaching Elegance* also records their abundance in the mountains of Shu.*—yet bearing blue-green flowers. It is called *zhuyu* (or sometimes *guicha*). Those who consume it will know no hunger.\n\nThere is also a tree whose form resembles the paper mulberry (*Pu notes: The paper mulberry is also called *gou*; it is named *gu* because its fruit resembles grain.*) but with black grain. Its blossoms radiate light in all four directions—*Pu notes: This refers to luminous brilliance. The *Songs of Chu* speaks of the “crimson blossoms of the Ruo Tree, whose light illumines the earth,” which is of the same kind.*—and it is named *migu*. Those who carry it will never lose their way.\n\nThere is an animal here resembling a *yu*—*Pu notes: The *yu* resembles a macaque but is larger, with red eyes and a long tail, and is commonly found in the mountains south of the Yangtze. Some accounts fail to clarify this creature. It is called *yu*, written with the character for “ox,” and depicted in illustrations as ox-like (or sometimes as a monkey), though both are incorrect.*—but with white ears. It moves swiftly on all fours and is called the *xingxing*. Those who eat it will gain fleetness of foot. The *shengsheng* (*Pu notes: A kind of *yu* beast resembling an ape, moving on all fours with its limbs intertwined, belongs to the same category.*) is recorded in Jing Fang’s *Book of Changes*.\n\nThe Lili River—*the character is pronounced *ji*—flows from this mountain, coursing westward into the sea. Its waters abound with *yupei* (details unknown).

Modern apes resemble macaques but have longer arms and legs, are agile and swift, and come in black and yellow hues. Their cries are mournful. It also yields *water jade*, which is today’s crystal. As the *Shanglin Fu* states: “Water jade gleams in heaped abundance.” This was what Master Red Pine consumed, as recorded in the *Lives of the Immortals*. The mountain is also rich in gold.\n\nThree hundred and eighty *li* farther east lies Mount Yuanyi. It teems with strange beasts and its waters with strange fish. The term “strange” refers to creatures of grotesque and unusual form. As *Master Shi* notes: “King Xu of Yan loved the strange. He plunged into deep waters to obtain strange fish and ventured into deep mountains to capture strange beasts, many of which he displayed in his court.” The mountain also yields white jade and harbors *belly worms*—*fu* worms with patterns like embroidered ribbons, a needle-like proboscis, and specimens weighing over a hundred *jin*; another name is *fanbi*.

It delights in gnawing, its mouth ever frothing with bloody spittle. The *sì* also resembles a water buffalo, its hide blue, its two horns weighing three thousand *jīn*. There are many elephants—the largest of beasts, with long trunks. The largest tusks reach a *zhàng* in length.

The markings on its head signify virtue; on its wings, righteousness; on its back, propriety; on its breast, benevolence; and on its belly, trust. This bird drinks and eats naturally, singing and dancing of its own accord. When it appears, the world knows peace.

      "translated_text": "Further northwest four hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Mi. Its name is pronounced *mi*. Atop it grow many cinnabar trees—round-leaved with crimson stems, bearing yellow blossoms and red fruit. Their taste is like maltose; eating them banishes hunger. The Cinnabar River rises here, flowing west into Ji Marsh. The Divine Farmer Hou Ji drowned in it, hence the name. Within it lies abundant white jade, and there is a jade nectar. Its source seethes and surges, the very appearance of jade nectar welling forth. The *River Chart Jade Tablet* states: “On Shaoshi Mountain grows white jade nectar; one dose and one becomes immortal.” This is of the same kind. *Fei* is pronounced *fu*.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor consumed and offered it. Thus he ascended the dragon at Ding Lake and shed his mortal form. From it is born dark jade, meaning all black jade emerges from the jade nectar. Where the jade nectar flows, it irrigates the cinnabar trees. After five years, the cinnabar trees assume the five colors and become radiant—meaning their luster shines. Their five flavors become fragrant, meaning their aroma is rich. The Yellow Emperor then gathered the jade blossoms of Mount Mi—referring to the jade’s splendor. The *Li Sao* says: “I cherish the splendid blossoms of the pepper tree,” and again: “I ascend Kunlun to feast on jade blossoms.” This is the jade spoken of in the *Ji Tomb Writings* as “Cao Hua’s jade.” He cast it upon the southern slopes of Mount Zhong to serve as jade seed.\n\nThe finest jade is that of *jin* and *yu*, meaning it is most excellent. Some write it as “to consume.” Both *jin* and *yu* are pronounced accordingly. Its grain is firm, fine, and dense—this describes the jade’s texture. The *Book of Rites* says: “Its density resembles millet,” where *su* may also be written as *li*. Jade with millet-like veins is called *gu bi*. It is lustrous despite its turbid richness—*zhuo* here means thick and moist. The five colors emerge in interplay, meaning their hues reflect one another. Prince Lingfu’s *Divine Talisman* states: “Red as a rooster’s comb, yellow as steamed millet, white as sliced fat, black as pure lacquer—these are the jade’s divine hues.” It harmonizes softness and hardness, meaning jade embodies the nine virtues.\n\nHeaven and Earth, ghosts and spirits, consume and offer it. Jade is used in prayers and sacrifices because it can move Heaven and Earth and stir ghosts and spirits. The noble person wears it to ward off misfortune. Nowadays, beyond the borders, adamantine stone is produced. It belongs to the stone family yet resembles metal, gleaming and capable of carving jade. Foreigners carry it, saying it repels malign qi—this is of the same kind.\n\nFrom Mount Mi to Mount Zhong spans four hundred and sixty *li*, all marshland. There abound singing birds, strange beasts, and wondrous fish—all extraordinary creatures.\n\nFurther northwest four hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Zhong. Its child is named Gu, also a divine name, simply called the child of Mount Zhong. Their forms are recorded in the *Returning to the Hidden: Divination of Qi*. They resemble humans with dragon bodies. The *Divination of Qi* says: “The child of Li Mountain has green feathers, eight faces, and a horse’s body.” This form is similar. They, along with Qin □ (pronounced *pi*), slew Bao Jiang on the southern slopes of Kunlun. *Bao* may also be written as *Zu*. The Emperor executed them east of Mount Zhong at □ (pronounced *yao* with a cliff radical). Qin □ transformed into a great osprey—*e*, of the eagle family, pronounced □. Its form resembles an eagle but with black patterns, a white head, red beak, and tiger claws. Its cry is like the morning swan—*chen hu*, of the osprey family, meaning “morning brightness.” The *Garden of Persuasion* says: “The county’s barking dogs compare to serving the morning swan.” When it appears, great war follows. Gu also transformed into a *jun* bird (pronounced *jun*). Its form resembles an owl, with red feet and a straight beak, yellow patterns and a white head. Its cry is like a swan’s. When it appears, its domain suffers severe drought. The *Tale of King Mu* says: “Mount Zhong heralds spring,” though the pronunciation is the same.\n\nKing Mu journeyed north beyond this mountain to survey the four wilds and declared: “Mount Zhong is the highest mountain under Heaven, where all beasts gather and flying birds roost.” There are red leopards, white tigers, white crows, and green eagles, seizing dogs and sheep, devouring boars and deer. King Mu observed Mount Zhong for five days, then inscribed his traces upon the hanging gardens to instruct later generations.\n\nFurther west one hundred and eighty *li* lies Mount Taiqi. The Guan River rises here, flowing west into the Flowing Sands. There abound patterned *yao* fish (pronounced *yao*). They resemble carp but with fish bodies and bird wings, azure patterns and white heads, red beaks. They constantly travel the Western Sea, roaming the Eastern Sea, and fly by night. Their cry is like the *luan* chicken—*luan ji*, a bird name, not yet identified. Some write it as *le*. Their flavor is sour-sweet; eating them cures madness. When they appear, the world enjoys great abundance—*feng rang*, meaning bountiful harvests. The *Hanzi* says: “In the autumn of a rich year.”\n\nFurther west three hundred and twenty *li* lies Mount Huaijiang. The Qiushi River rises here, flowing north into the You River.",
      "overlap_context": "sh or Puchang Sea, spanning three to four hundred *li*. Its waters stagnate, neither increasing nor decreasing in winter or summer.

Both *gun* and *pao* are pronounced accordingly.)\n\nHere grows a fine fruit. Its fruit resembles the peach, its leaves the jujube. Its flowers are yellow with red *fu*. Eating it prevents fatigue.",

Its heights abound in green *xionghuang* (realgar) and conceal *langgan*, gold, and jade. *Langgan* refers to stones resembling pearls. *Cang* means \"hidden.\" Pronounced *lang* and *gan*. Its southern slopes yield many cinnabar grains, while its northern slopes yield fine gold and silver.\n\nThis is truly the Emperor’s level garden, that is, the Dark Garden. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"Thereupon he inscribed his traces upon the Dark Garden,\" meaning he carved stone to record his merits and virtues, as the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han did.\n\nThe spirit Yingzhao presides over it. *Si* means \"to govern.\" Pronounced *shao*.

The spirit Lu Wu governs it—Lu Wu being the same as Jian Wu. Zhuangzi said: \"Jian Wu received it to dwell upon the great mountain.\" This spirit has the body of a tiger, nine tails, the face of a human, and tiger claws. It oversees the nine divisions of heaven and the seasons of the Thearch’s gardens, presiding over the boundaries of the nine celestial domains and the seasonal adornments of the Heavenly Emperor’s parks.\n\nThere is a beast here, its form like a sheep but with four horns, called *Tu Lou*, which devours humans. There is a bird, its form like a wasp but as large as a mandarin duck, named *Qin Yuan* (*Qin* may also be written as *You* or *Zhi*). Where it stings beasts, they die; where it stings trees, they wither. There is another bird, named *Chun Niao*, which oversees the Thearch’s myriad implements—*fu* meaning \"utensils\" or, alternatively, \"service.\" Elsewhere, there is a tree resembling the *tang* (pear), with yellow blossoms and red fruit. Its taste is like a plum but without a pit, called *Sha Tang*. It can ward off drowning, and those who eat it shall not sink. (The text here is fragmentary.) *Sha Tang* is a wood that cannot... (text incomplete). *The Annals of Lü Buwei* states: \"Among the finest fruits is the fruit of the *Sha Tang*.\" An inscription reads: \"...*Sha Tang*... carved into a boat, drifting upon the azure sea, to roam and wander.\"\n\nThere is a herb named *□-grass* (pronounced *pin*), its form like the mallow, its taste like the scallion. Eating it cures fatigue. *The Annals of Lü Buwei* states: \"Among the finest vegetables is the *□* of Kunlun.\" The Ke Water issues forth from the mountain’s northeast corner, flowing southward and eastward into Wu Da (a mountain name). The Chi Water emerges from the southeast corner, flowing southeast into Fan Tian’s waters (Fan Tian being another mountain, where the Chi Water ends). *The Chronicle of King Mu* records: \"Thereupon he lodged beside Kunlun, on the yang (north) side of the Chi Water.\" *Yang* refers to the north bank of a river; *fan* is pronounced with the *fu* and *jian* initials.\n\nThe Yang Water flows from the northwest corner (sometimes written as *Wei*). It courses southwest into Chou Tu’s waters (Chou Tu being another mountain, all located in the southern extremity). *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"On *wu-chen*, he crossed the Yang Water,\" also called \"the Son of Heaven’s Yang Water.\" The Hei Water also issues from the northwest corner, flowing west into Da Yu (a mountain name). *The Chronicle of King Mu* records: \"Thereupon he sealed the burial of Chang Gong west of the Hei Water’s western river, declaring it the summit of Kunlun’s Hong Lü, to serve as the Zhou royal house’s presiding spirit.\" *Gan* is pronounced *yu*. The region abounds in monstrous birds and beasts—such as a single beast with nine heads or a bird with six heads.\n\nThree hundred and seventy *li* farther west lies Mount Le You. The Tao River flows from it, coursing west into Ji Marsh, where white jade is plentiful. Within dwell many *□-fish* (pronounced *yu*), their form like a serpent but with four legs, which prey upon fish.\n\nTraveling four hundred *li* west by waterway and two hundred *li* farther reaches Mount Ying Mu, governed by the spirit Chang Cheng, who embodies the nine virtues of heaven—the vital *qi* of the nine virtues. This spirit resembles a human but with a *you*-like tail (pronounced with the *zhuo* and *yao* initials). The mountain’s heights are rich in jade, its lower slopes in green stone, yet it lacks water.\n\nThree hundred and fifty *li* farther west lies Jade Mountain, the dwelling of the Queen Mother of the West. This mountain abounds in jade and stones, hence its name. *The Chronicle of King Mu* calls it the Mountain of Myriad Jades, noting its unobstructed rivers and roads, all aligned as if by a carpenter’s line, the so-called \"strategic treasury\" of the former kings. Sparse in grass and trees, devoid of birds and beasts, King Mu there quarried its jade and stones, taking three chariot-loads of jade slabs, jade utensils, and ceremonial objects, carrying ten thousand *zhi* of jade back with him. (Two jades make a *ke*; half a *ke* makes a *zhi*.)\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West resembles a human, with a leopard’s tail, tiger’s fangs, and a penchant for howling. Her hair is disheveled, and she wears a *sheng* (a jade hairpin, pronounced *pang*). She governs heaven’s calamities and the Five Destructions, presiding over the *qi* of disasters, plagues, and the five punishments of execution. *The Chronicle of King Mu* states: \"On the auspicious day *jia-zi*, the Son of Heaven was received as a guest by the Queen Mother of the West. He presented a *gui* tablet of jade and a white jade disc, offering a hundred rolls of dark silk and three hundred rolls of deep blue silk. The Queen Mother of the West bowed twice and accepted them. On *yi-chou*, the Son of Heaven toasted the Queen Mother of the West upon the Jasper Pool. The Queen Mother of the West sang for the Son of Heaven:\n\n*White clouds drift in the sky,*\n*The mountains and hills arise on their own.*\n*The roads stretch far and wide,*\n*Mountains and rivers lie between.*\n*May you not die, my lord,*\n*And come again.*\n\nThe Son of Heaven responded:\n*I return to the eastern lands,*\n*To harmonize and govern the central states.*\n*When the myriad people are equitable and at peace,*\n*I shall see you again.*\n*Within three years,*\n*I shall revisit your wilds.*\n\nThe Queen Mother of the West then chanted for the Son of Heaven:\n*Dwelling in the western lands,*\n*Abiding in your place,*\n*Tigers and leopards gather in packs,*\n*Crows and magpies keep you company.*\n*Auspicious fate does not depart,*\n*For I am the Thearch’s daughter.*\n*What manner of mortal are you,*\n*Who would now leave me?*\n*Blowing the sheng and striking the reed pipes,*\n*My heart soars freely.*\n*O child of this generation,*\n*You are heaven’s hope.*\n\nThereupon the Son of Heaven was moved.

Some call it the *jiao*, and its cry is like a barking dog. Wherever it appears, the land enjoys great abundance.\n\nIn the tenth year of the Tai Kang reign of Jin, a beast was captured in a cage in Fuyi County of Shaoling. Its form bore leopard markings, with two horns but no forelegs. The people of the time took it for the *jiao*, though this was uncertain.\n\nThere is a bird whose form resembles a pheasant but is red, called the *shengyu*, of the *Ting* clan. It feeds on fish, and its cry is like *lu* (音绿), though the meaning is unclear. Wherever it appears, the land suffers great floods.\n\nFour hundred and eighty *li* further west lies the Mound of Xuanyuan. No grasses or trees grow there. The Yellow Thearch dwelt upon this mound and took a daughter of the Western Mound clan as his wife, whence it is called the Mound of Xuanyuan. The Xun River (音询) issues forth from here, flowing southward into the Black River. Its waters abound with cinnabar grains and much green realgar.\n\nThree hundred *li* further west stands Mount Jishi. At its base lies a stone gate through which the River waters surge westward—*mao* meaning \"to cover.\" Mount Jishi is located among the Qiang tribes southwest of Jincheng and Hemen Pass, where the River waters course [through gaps] and enter the passes from the east. This mountain contains all things under heaven.\n\nThe *Classic of Waters* cites the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*, stating: \"Mount Jishi lies east of Denglin Mountain, where the River enters.\"\n\nTwo hundred *li* further west lies Mount Changliu, where the White Thearch Shaohao resides. Shaohao, of the Metal Heaven clan, is the title of Thearch Zhi. The beasts here all bear patterned tails—or sometimes long ones. The birds all bear patterned heads—or sometimes long ones. The mountain abounds with patterned jade stones. It is in truth the palace of the Round Spirit Kui (音隗). This spirit governs the reflection of light. When the sun sets in the west, its light is reflected eastward, and the spirit oversees its observation.\n\nTwo hundred and eighty *li* further west lies Mount Zhangyi. No grasses or trees grow there, but it abounds with *yao* jade and *bi* jade (*bi* being another kind of jade). The phenomena there are most strange, and many extraordinary things are found.",

This mountain stands where the sun sets in the west; its *qi* is round, the sun’s form is round, and thus its celestial aspect is likewise round. It is governed by the spirit of Crimson Radiance, though its appearance has not been described.\n\nProceeding west by water for a hundred *li* brings one to Mount Yiwang (or, as some write, Mount Tucui). No grasses or trees grow here, but gold and jade are plentiful. A beast dwells here, shaped like a wildcat, with one eye and three tails—its name is *Huan* (pronounced like \"joy,\" sometimes written *Yuan*). Its cry resembles a hundred voices, for it can mimic the sounds of a hundred creatures. (Some say *Huan* is a creature’s name, though this remains unverified.) It wards off misfortune, and wearing its pelt cures *zhang*-illness (yellow *zhang*-disease, pronounced like \"dawn\"). A bird also lives here, shaped like an ordinary bird but with three heads, six tails, and a fondness for laughter—its name is *Qiyi* (awaiting the two missing pronunciations). Consuming it prevents *yan*-dreams (dream-oppression; in the *Book of Zhou*, *yan* means \"unrestful,\" pronounced like *moli* in reverse; some say it refers to blurred vision). It, too, wards off misfortune.\n\nFrom the first mountain of the Third Western Range, Mount Chongwu, to Mount Yiwang, there are twenty-three mountains spanning six thousand seven hundred and forty-four *li*. Their spirits all take the form of sheep-bodied, human-faced beings. The rites for their worship require burying a single auspicious jade (a jade adorned with colors; the *Master Shi* states: \"Auspicious jade is a great tortoise\"). The offering of essence uses glutinous millet.\n\nThe first mountain of the Fourth Western Range is called Mount Yin. Its heights are rich in grains but devoid of stone, and its grasses are mostly *mao* and *fan* (*mao* is *jikui*; *fan* is green *fan*, resembling sedge but larger; *mao* has two pronunciations). The Yin River flows from here, coursing west into the Luo. Fifty *li* to the north lies Mount Lao, where this grass grows in abundance. It is also called *eryi*, its center dyed purple.

The Qu River flows from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the north lies Mount Niao. Its heights are thick with mulberry trees, its lower slopes with paper mulberries, its shaded side with iron, and its sunlit side with jade. The Ru River flows from here, running east into the Yellow River.\n\nOne hundred twenty *li* further north stands Mount Shangshen. No grasses or trees grow on its heights, but many *luo* stones lie there (*luo*, pronounced like \"stone,\" refers to large rocks). Its lower slopes bear many hazel and *hu* trees (hazelnuts resemble chestnuts but are smaller and sweet; *hu* wood is used for arrows; the *Book of Songs* says: \"Hazel and *hu* grow thickly\"; *hu* has two pronunciations).

When it appears, the region suffers great floods.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty *li* further west lies the mountain known as Bird-and-Mouse-Same-Burrow. Today it stands southwest of Shouyang County in Longxi. The mountain harbors birds and mice that share a burrow: the bird is called *□*, the mouse *□*. The mouse resembles a house mouse but with a short tail; the bird is like a swallow but yellow in color. They tunnel several *chi* into the earth, the mouse dwelling within, the bird without, yet living together. The *Kongshi Shangshu Commentary* states they mate as male and female. The *Zhangshi Dili Ji* claims they do not. Its summit abounds in white tigers and white jade.\n\nThe Wei River rises here, flowing east into the Yellow River. It emerges from the mountain’s east, reaching Hongnong’s Huayin County before entering the river. Within its waters dwell many *sao* fish, pronounced like *sao*, resembling the *zu* fish (a large fish with its mouth beneath its chin and a body covered in connected scales). Some write it as *nianli*. When they stir, the region faces great warfare. (Some texts omit the phrase \"when they stir\" and what follows.)\n\nThe Lan River, pronounced *kan*, rises to its west, flowing west into the Han River. It teems with *□□* fish, pronounced like *piliang*, resembling an overturned *diao* (a cooking vessel), with a crow’s head, fish’s wings, and fish’s tail, its cry like the sound of a chime stone. They produce pearls and jade—akin to pearl-oysters, yet capable of birthing them.\n\nThree hundred and sixty *li* southwest stands Mount Yanzi, the mountain where the sun sets, as mentioned in the *Li Sao*. Pronounced *yanzī* (two readings). Its summit abounds in cinnabar trees, their leaves like millet, their fruit as large as melons, red in texture with black veins. Eating them cures malaria and can ward off fire. Its southern slopes teem with tortoises; its northern slopes, with jade. The *Tiao* River (or *Ruo* River, as some write it) rises here, flowing west into the sea. The *Yu Da Zhuan* states: \"The Weipan River rises from Mount Yanzi.\" Within its waters abound whetstones—fine ones called *di*, coarse ones *li*.\n\nA beast dwells here, resembling a horse in body but with crow’s wings, a human face, and a serpent’s tail. It delights in lifting people, often embracing and raising them. It is called *shuhu*. A bird also dwells here, resembling an owl but with a human face, a *wei*-monkey’s body (the *wei* being a kind of macaque, pronounced like *zengyi* or *zhu*), and a dog’s tail (or back, as some texts have it). Its name is its own cry. Some write it as *she*, meaning it also calls thus—this may be a textual error. When it appears, the region suffers severe drought.\n\nIn all, the fourth western section, from Mount Yin to Mount Yanzi, comprises nineteen mountains spanning three thousand six hundred and eighty *li*. For their sacrifices, one white chicken is used in prayer, with glutinous rice as the offering, and white *jian* grass as the mat.\n\nIn total, the Western Mountains record seventy-seven mountains, spanning seventeen thousand five hundred and ten *li.\n\n*Western Mountains Classic: Illustrations and Eulogies*\n*Xian Yang*",

The *Erya* describes the *bo* without mentioning its horn or tiger claws, though it appears in the *Changshou* illustrations. It can ward off weapons—raising it repels blades.",

This bird has already been mentioned above; it may share the same name. It reproduces without male or female, and eating it prevents jaundice—jaundice being the disease of *yongju* (boils and abscesses).\n\nThe *Peng* River rises here, flowing westward into the waters of *Bi* Lake. Within it swim many *tiao* fish (pronounced *you*), shaped like chickens with crimson plumage, three tails, six feet, and four heads.

Eating them prevents *dan* (feverish illness).\n\nIts heights are rich in pine and cypress, its depths in *□jiang* (a type of oak). Its beasts are mostly antelope, its birds mostly *fan* (unverified; some say it is the owl, pronounced *fan*).\n\nTo the north by three hundred and eighty li lies *Guo* Mountain. Its heights abound in lacquer trees, its depths in tung and *ju* trees—the *tongwu* being the tung tree, and *ju* being the *kui* wood, used for staffs with swollen nodes (pronounced *qu*). Its southern slopes are rich in jade, its northern slopes in iron.\n\nThe *Yi* River rises here, flowing westward into the Yellow River. Its beasts are mostly *tuo-tuo* (camels), which bear fleshy humps and traverse flowing sands with ease, covering three hundred li in a day.

The *Gang* River rises here, flowing westward into *You* Marsh. There dwells a beast resembling a *yu* (monkey), its body patterned and fond of laughter; upon seeing humans, it feigns sleep—*yanmian* (feigning slumber).

Upon seeing humans, it calls out; it is named *Zuzhui*, and its cry is its own name. There also dwells a bird resembling a female pheasant but with a human face; upon seeing humans, it leaps—named *Songsi*, its cry is its own name. The *Jinhan* River rises here, flowing westward into *You* Marsh, and its waters abound in lodestone, which can attract iron. *Cishi* (lodestone)—as *Guanzi* states: \"Where lodestone lies above, copper lies below; thus may it be retrieved.\"\n\nFurther north by one hundred and eighty *li* lies *Danzhang* Mountain. Its heights bear no grasses or trees. There dwells a beast resembling a leopard, with a long tail, human head, oxen ears, and a single eye—named *Zhujian*, pronounced like *jian* in *jianniu* (castrated ox). It roars fiercely, walking with its tail in its mouth and resting with its tail coiled. There also dwells a bird resembling a pheasant but with a patterned head, white wings, and yellow feet—named *Baiye*, pronounced *ye*. Eating it cures throat pain—*ai* (throat), as in the *Guliang Commentary*: \"The throat admits no grain.\" The people of Wu call the throat *ai*, pronounced *ai*.

Further north by two hundred and eighty *li* lies *Daxian* Mountain, also barren of grasses or trees, though its lower slopes abound in jade. This mountain cannot be ascended from any side. There dwells a serpent named *changshe* (long serpent), its bristles resembling those of a boar. Some say it measures a hundred *xun* in length. The present-day *huangshe* (pit viper) is patterned like green silk cords, with bristles like a boar’s mane—this is its kind. *Changshan* also bears long serpents, though their forms differ. Its cry resembles the sound of a wooden clapper—like the *tuo* (night watchman’s rattle) sounded by travelers at night, pronounced *tuo*.\n\nFurther north by three hundred and twenty *li* lies *Dunhong* Mountain.

There are no grasses or trees, and the winds blow fiercely. This mountain spans a hundred *li* in breadth and width.\n\nThe beginning of the \"Third Eastern Classic\" commences at Mount Shi Hu and extends to Mount Wu Gao, comprising nine mountains over six thousand nine hundred *li*. The spirits here all bear human bodies with ram’s horns. Their sacrifices require one uncastrated ram and glutinous millet. When these spirits appear, wind, rain, and floods bring ruin.\n\nThe beginning of the \"Fourth Eastern Classic\" is Mount Bei Hao, which overlooks the Northern Sea. There grows a tree whose form resembles the poplar, with red blossoms. Its fruit is like the jujube but without a pit, its flavor tart and sweet. Eating it prevents malaria.

It abounds in gold and jade but has no stones. The Shi River issues forth here, flowing north into Gao Marsh. Within it abound *xiū* fish and patterned cowries. There is a beast whose form resembles a piglet but with tusks, named *dāng kāng*.

Its heights abound in *niǔ* trees, while below grow grasses with mallow stems and apricot leaves, or in some accounts, *hù* leaves. Their yellow blossoms bear pods, called *□* (pronounced *tuōluò*), which can cure drowsiness.\n\nThere is a beast here, resembling a field mouse but with striped brows—*□* (a variant of *huǐ*, though the creature remains obscure). It is called *□* (pronounced *nà*, sometimes rendered as *bear*), and eating it cures goiter.\n\nTwenty *li* east lies Mount Lì’ér. Its heights are dense with oak and *lì* trees (pronounced *lì*). This tree has square stems and round leaves, yellow and downy, with fruit like the *liàn* tree (a type of tree; its seeds resemble fingertips, white and sticky, used for washing clothes—pronounced *liàn*, sometimes written as *jiǎn*). Consuming it sharpens memory.\n\nFifteen *li* east stands Mount Qúzhū. Its heights are thick with bamboo. The Qúzhū River flows southward from here into the Yellow River. Its waters teem with *háoyú* (variant note: shaped like the *wěi* fish, which resembles the *zhān*), with red beaks and red-feathered tails, which can cure white scaling.\n\nThirty-five *li* east rises Mount Cōnglóng. Its valleys are vast, rich in white chalk, black-green, and yellow chalk (indicating multicolored chalk).\n\nFifteen *li* east lies Mount Wō (pronounced *wō*).

Here grows a grass resembling mallow leaves with red blossoms, its pods like *□* pods (modern *□* pods resemble *zàojiá*). Called *zhíchǔ*, it can cure *shǔ* (a wasting disease; as the *Huainanzi* states, \"fox heads cure *shǔ*\"). Eating it prevents insomnia.\n\nTwenty *li* east rises Mount Jīnxīng. It abounds in *tiānyīng*, shaped like dragon bones, which can cure *cuó* (boils and sores).\n\nSeventy *li* east lies Mount Tàiwēi.

Its summit holds much gold and jade, its base many *suan* stones and patterned stones—*suan* stones remain undetermined in meaning. It abounds in iron, and its trees are mostly willow, *niu*, sandalwood, and paper mulberry. To its east lies a forest named Mangfu, rich in fine trees and birds and beasts.\n\nOne hundred and fifty *li* east stands Mount Fufu. Its summit holds much yellow gold, its base much green realgar. Its trees are mostly mulberry and paper mulberry, its grasses mostly bamboo. The spirit Jigu resides here, human in form but wielding two serpents, often roaming the depths of the Yangtze, emerging and entering with radiance.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* southeast lies Mount Dongting. Today, west of Yiling County in Changsha, there is also a Dongting embankment, submerged and connected to the Yangtze. The *Li Sao* says: \"I turned my way by Dongting, / Where waves rose and leaves fell.\" Both refer to this place. The character is sometimes written as *tong* (copper), but the water radical is more fitting. Its summit holds much yellow gold, its base much silver and iron. Its trees abound in wild plums, pears, tangerines, and pomelos; its grasses abound in orchids, *miwu*, peonies, and *xiongqiong*. *Miwu* resembles *shechuang* but is fragrant.\n\nThe two daughters of the Celestial Thearch reside here, divine beings of the Yangtze. These are the two Jiang consorts of the *Liexian Zhuan*. The \"Xiang Lady\" of the *Li Sao*’s *Nine Songs*, addressed as \"Imperial Child,\" refers to them. Yet the *Hetu Yuban* states: \"The Xiang Lady was the daughter of Emperor Yao.\" When the First Emperor of Qin sailed the Yangtze to Xiang Mountain and encountered a great storm, he asked his scholars: \"What god is the Xiang Lord?\" The scholars replied: \"We have heard they were Yao’s two daughters and Shun’s consorts, who died and were buried here.\" The *Lienü Zhuan* says: \"The two women died between the Jiang and Xiang rivers, and the custom calls them the Xiang Lord.\" Zheng Sinong also took Shun’s consorts to be the Xiang Lord. Commentators all claim that when Shun died on his southern tour, his two consorts followed and drowned together in the Xiang River, hence their title as the Xiang Ladies.\n\nYet in the *Nine Songs*, the Xiang Lord and Xiang Lady are distinct deities. The presence of a Lady in the Jiang and Xiang is like the consorts of the Yellow and Luo Rivers. Their numinosity is coeval with heaven and earth—how could they be called Yao’s daughters? And if they were Yao’s daughters, how could they collectively be called the Xiang Lord? To verify this: the *Record of Rites* states: \"Shun was buried in Cangwu, and his two consorts did not follow.\" Clearly, the two consorts did not accompany him in life or death; the principle is evident. Even if they had followed, the two women’s divine insight and boundless perception could have saved them from the crisis of the well and granary with bird-work and dragon robes—how could they not have escaped the wind and waves to suffer a double drowning?\n\nIf this were so, the *Tradition* says: \"In life, they were high ministers; in death, noble spirits. Their rites equaled the Five Marshes and rivaled the Three Dukes, the Four Seas and the feudal lords.\" Yet the Xiang River does not rank among the Four Waterways, nor is it listed in the mandated sacrifices. As descendants of an emperor, how could the two women’s divine essence descend to a minor river as mere ladies? Comparing the accounts, the meanings are jumbled; weaving the principles, no basis remains. This cannot be so.\n\nThe root of the error lies in conflating the title \"imperial daughter,\" confusing name and reality. No one corrected the mistake, and falsehood prevailed over truth, persisting unrecognized through the ages—how lamentable! They often roam the depths of the Yangtze. The winds of the Li and Yuan rivers mingle in the abyss of Xiao and Xiang. The *Sa* verse says the two women play in the river’s abyssal palace, where they can stir the Three Jiang and harmonize the winds and waves, expressing their numinous power.\n\nThe Yangtze, Xiang, and Yuan rivers all converge at the head of Baling, hence called the Mouth of the Three Jiang. The Li River joins them seventy or eighty *li* further on. The *Huainanzi* says: \"Fowling and fishing on the Xiao and Xiang.\" Their present location remains unclear. *Xiao* is pronounced *xiao*. This lies between the Nine Jiang. The *Geographical Records* state: \"The Nine Jiang are now south of Xunyang.\" The Yangtze divides into nine branches, all flowing east to join the great river. The *Book* says: \"The Nine Jiang are most vast.\" This is it.\n\nTheir comings and goings are always with whirlwinds and violent storms.",

In Jiaozhi, there is also *di* bamboo, hollow and exceptionally strong, its poison capable of piercing tigers to kill them. This is of the same kind.

Strange birds abound as well.\n\nOne hundred and eighty *li* to the southeast lies Mount Bao. Its forests are thick with □, nanmu, thorn, *qi*, arrow bamboo, □, and *jun*—all varieties of fine bamboo. The \"Arrow\" bamboo is noted in the *Tribute of Yu*. The mountain’s heights yield gold and jade, its depths abound in quartz, striped stone, and iron. Its beasts are mostly elk, river deer, and *jiu*—the *jiu* being the osprey, as recorded in the *Guangya*.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the southeast stands Mount Jigong. Its heights are rich in gold, its depths in *fufu* jade. Its woods thrive with willow, *niu*, sandalwood, and mulberry. There dwells a creature named *gui*, shaped like a tortoise yet white-bodied, with a crimson head. Its name is pronounced *gui*. It can ward off fire.\n\nOne hundred and fifty-nine *li* to the southeast rises Mount Yao. Its northern slopes bear yellow ochre, its southern gold. Its forests grow thorn, *qi*, willow, and sandalwood, while its grasses include *shuyu* and □.\n\nOne *shi* to the southeast lies Mount Jiangfu. Its heights yield silver and whetstone, though no patterned timber grows there. Its beasts are mostly swine and deer.\n\nTwo hundred *li* to the east stands Mount Zhenling. Its heights abound in gold, its depths in jade. Its woods grow millet, oak, willow, and *niu*, while its grasses include *rong* grass.\n\nOne hundred and twenty *li* to the southeast rises Mount Yangdi. It holds fine copper. Its forests grow sandalwood, *niu*, paper mulberry, and *yan*—the *yan* being mountain mulberry. Its beasts are mostly antelope and musk deer.\n\nNinety *li* to the south lies Mount Chaisang—now the southern part of Chaisang County in Xunyang, connected to Mount Ting. Its heights yield silver, its depths jade and malachite, along with cold stone and ochre. Its woods grow willow, *qi*, paper mulberry, and mulberry, while its beasts are mostly elk and deer. White serpents and flying serpents—those that soar by gathering mist—abound here.\n\nTwo hundred and thirty *li* to the southeast stands Mount Rongyu. Its heights yield copper, its depths silver. Its woods grow willow and *qi*, while its creatures include monstrous serpents and strange insects.\n\nFrom the first peak of the Dongting range, Mount Pianyu, to Mount Rongyu, there are fifteen mountains spanning two thousand eight hundred *li*. Their spirits all take the form of birds with dragon heads. For their sacrifices: one rooster and one sow are offered, the latter slit open (the act called *ci*). The sacrificial grain is glutinous millet.\n\nMounts Fufu, Jigong, Yao, and Yangdi are all burial mounds. Their sacrifices involve *siyi*—the display of offerings before burial. Wine is used in prayer, with a lamb as the animal offering, its wool adorned with one auspicious jade.\n\nThe gods of Dongting and Mount Rongyu receive *siyi* sacrifices as well. After the display, offerings are buried as before. Wine is used in prayer, with a grand sacrifice of a bull, and the ritual jades include fifteen *gui* and *bi* discs, adorned with five colors.\n\nThe \"Central Mountains\" section of the *Classic of Mountains* records a total of one hundred ninety-seven mountains spanning twenty-one thousand three hundred seventy-one *li*.\n\nIn all, the world’s renowned mountains number five thousand three hundred seventy, covering sixty-four thousand fifty-six *li*—this is the extent of the land.

Mountains that give rise to rivers measure eight thousand *li*, while those that receive waters measure the same. Copper-bearing mountains number four hundred sixty-seven, iron-bearing mountains three thousand six hundred ninety. These are the lands where heaven and earth apportion soil and cultivate grain, where spears and halberds are forged, where blades and swords arise. The skilled have abundance, the unskilled want.

      "translated_text": "The Kingdom of Three Heads lies to its east, where each person has one body but no voice. Another account places it east of Chisel-Tooth.\n\nThe Kingdom of Zhourao lies to its east, where the people are short in stature but wear caps and belts. Their horses stand three *chi* tall, dwell in caves, and are skilled in craftsmanship, possessing five distinct abilities. Another account places the Kingdom of Jiaoyao east of the Kingdom of Three Heads. The *Waizhuan* states: \"The people of Jiaoyao are three *chi* tall, the shortest of all.\" The *Shi Han Shenwu* says: \"Four hundred thousand *li* east of the Central Plains, one finds the people of Jiaoyao, one *chi* and five *cun* in height.\"\n\nThe Kingdom of Long Arms lies to its east, where the people catch fish in the water, each hand holding a fish. An old account says their hands hang down to the ground. During the Huangchu era of the Wei, Governor Wang Xu of Xuantu pursued the palace of the King of Goguryeo to its end. Passing through the Kingdom of Wooju, its eastern border reached the great sea, near where the sun rises. He asked the elders: \"Are there people beyond the sea?\" They replied that once, in the sea, they found a cloth garment, its body like that of a middle-sized person, with sleeves three *chi* long—this was the clothing of the Long-Armed people. Another account places it east of Jiaoyao, where they catch fish in the sea.\n\nMount Di: Emperor Yao was buried on its sunny side. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* says: \"Yao was buried in Gulin.\" Today, in the western part of Yangcheng County, near the city of Dong’e County, and south of Xiangting in Zheyang County, there are all said to be Yao’s tombs. Emperor Ku was buried on its shady side. Ku, Yao’s father, was called Gaoxin; his tomb now lies in the Kuaiyin wilds south of Dunqiu County. *Ku* is pronounced like *kù*. There are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, and leopard-like tigers. The *Shizi* says: \"Zhonghuang Boyu, with his left hand, seized a great ape of the Taihang Mountains, and with his right, grappled a leopard-like tiger.\" *Wei* are a kind of macaque. *Lizhu* is the name of a tree; see the *Zhuangzi*. Modern illustrations depict it as a red crow. *Shirou* (\"seeing flesh\") and *jurou* (\"gathering flesh\") resemble ox liver, with two eyes. They can be eaten endlessly, for as soon as they are consumed, they regenerate as before. *Xuyan* and *suozhi* are unclear. King Wen buried them all in their respective places. Today, King Wen’s tomb lies in the eastern altar of Hao in Chang’an. According to the records, the tombs of the kings all have fixed locations, yet the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* often repeats them. This is because the sages ruled for long periods, their benevolence spreading widely, their kindness extending even to birds and beasts. When they passed away, the Four Seas mourned as if they had lost their parents, and there was no grief unexpressed. Thus, people from distant lands and foreign customs, upon hearing of the Son of Heaven’s death, would sit and offer sacrifices, weeping and wailing, and raise mounds of earth as tombs. This is why such tombs appear in many places. It is like the temples of the Son of Heaven found in all the distant commanderies and kingdoms of the Han—this is their legacy. Another account calls it Mount Tang. Another says there are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, *wei*, leopards, *lizhu*, *□jiu*, *□jiu*, and creatures like owls. *Shirou*, *hujiao*, and *suozhi* remain unclear.

The dance was a grand spectacle of whirling motion. He rode two dragons, his cloud-canopy layered thrice. In his left hand, he held a feathered banner; in his right, a jade ring—crafted from hollowed nephrite. A jade *huang* hung at his waist, the *huang* being a half-disc of jade. This took place north of Dayun Mountain.\n\nThe *Gui Zang Zheng Mu Jing* states: *\"When Xia Hou Qi divined, he rode a flying dragon to ascend the heavens—auspicious.\"* Thus it is clear Qi, too, was a transcendent.\n\nAnother name for this place is the **Wilds of Great Legacy**. The *Classic of the Great Wilderness* calls it the **Wilds of Great Solemnity**.\n\n**The Land of Three Bodies** lies north of Xia Hou Qi, its people bearing one head and three torsos.\n\n**The Land of One Arm** lies to its north, its people possessing one arm, one eye, and one nostril.\n\nThere are **yellow horses** there, striped like tigers, with one eye and one hoof.\n\n**The Land of Extraordinary Skill** (or *Qi*, pronounced *ji*) lies further north. Its people have one arm and three eyes, embodying both yin and yang, and ride patterned steeds—yin above, yang below, the patterned steed being a white horse with dark markings.\n\nA bird dwells nearby, two-headed and of reddish-yellow hue. The people of this land excel in craftsmanship, snaring all manner of fowl. They fashion flying chariots, traveling far on the wind. In the time of Tang, one was found within the borders of Yuzhou; the king had it ground to dust, refusing to show it to others. Ten years later, when the west wind returned, he had another made and sent it away.\n\n**Xingtian** contended with the Thearch for divine authority here. The Thearch severed his head and buried it on **Changyang Mountain**, whereupon Xingtian made eyes of his nipples and a mouth of his navel, brandishing shield and axe in dance—the shield being a buckler, the *qi* a battle-axe. Thus he became the **Headless People**.\n\n**Nü Ji** and **Nü Qi** dwell to their north, between two rivers. Nü Qi holds a fish—of the eel family—while Nü Ji wields a sacrificial platter.\n\nThe **Jing Bird** and the **□ Bird** (pronounced *zhan* or *liang*) follow in their wake, their feathers blue-yellow. Wherever they pass, kingdoms perish. These are birds of plague and calamity, akin to the modern owl and horned owl.\n\nNorth of Nü Ji lies the **Jing Bird**, a man-faced creature dwelling upon mountains. Another name for it is the **Wei Bird**, gathering place of azure birds and yellow crows.\n\n**The Land of Husbandmen** lies north of the Wei Bird. Its people wear robes, caps, and girded swords.\n\nWhen **Emperor Da Wu** of the **Ao Clan** sent **Wang Meng** to gather herbs, he journeyed from the **Queen Mother of the West** to the north, where his path was cut off by impassable roots. He sustained himself on tree fruits and clad himself in bark. Though he lived his life without a wife, two sons were born from his body; when their father died, they became the **People of Husbandmen**.",

Its inhabitants lack kidneys (here meaning the intestines). They dwell in caves, consume earth, and know no distinction of male or female. When one dies, they bury the body; the heart does not decay, and after one hundred and twenty years, the dead revive.\n\n**Zhong Mountain’s Deity**\nThe deity of Zhong Mountain is named *Zhu Yin* (also called *Zhu Long*, the Torch Dragon). It illuminates the Nine Yin, hence its name. When it opens its eyes, it is day; when it closes them, it is night. Its breath brings winter; its exhalation, summer. It neither drinks nor eats nor rests; its breath becomes wind (here, *qi* breath). Its body stretches a thousand *li*. To the east of Wuqiong, this being has the face of a human, the body of a serpent, and a crimson hue, dwelling at the foot of Zhong Mountain. The *Huainanzi* states: \"A dragon with one foot.\" The Land of One-Eye lies to its east, where people have a single eye centered in their faces. Another account says they possess hands and feet.\n\n**The Land of Rouli**\nThe Land of Rouli lies east of the One-Eyed People. Its inhabitants have one hand and one foot, with knees bent backward and feet curled upward (one foot and one hand, twisted and inverted). Another version calls it the Land of Liuliu, where people’s feet fold backward.\n\n**Xiangliu, Minister of Gonggong**\nXiangliu was a minister of Gonggong (the usurper who seized the Nine Provinces). It had nine heads, each devouring the creatures of a different mountain—an image of insatiable greed and violence.

      "translated_text": "Yu slew Xiangliu, but its blood reeked so foully that no five grains could be sown in the tainted soil. Yu dug deep into the earth, excavating three times to a depth of three *ren*, yet the blood still seeped upward, saturating the land with its greasy foulness. Thus, he raised the Terrace of the Many Sovereigns upon it—a place where the sodden earth could only bear piled soil for a platform. This terrace lies north of Kunlun (the Kunlun beyond the seas) and east of the Land of Rouli.\n\nXiangliu had nine human-faced heads, a serpent’s body, and was blue in hue. None dared shoot arrows northward, for they feared the Terrace of Gonggong, which stood to its east. The terrace was square, with a serpent at each corner—tiger-striped, their heads all facing south.\n\nEast of the terrace lies the Land of Deep Eyes, where people raise one hand to shield a single eye. Another version calls it the Land of *Yi*. It is said to be near Gonggong’s [missing text].\n\nEast (or south, in another version) of the Land of Deep Eyes lies the Land of the Gutless, where people are tall but lack intestines—all they consume passes straight through. Further east is the Land of Clasping Ears, where tigers bring rain in patterns, and its people’s ears are so long they must hold them with their hands (*nie*, pronounced *nuò jiá*).\n\nThere is a settlement in the sea, a city amidst the waters and the strange creatures that emerge from them—a place where all marvels are gathered. East of it roam two tigers.\n\nKua Fu raced the sun, chasing it into the horizon. As the sun neared the land of Jiang Ren, he pursued it still. Thirst overtook him, and he drank from the Yellow River and the Wei; when these were not enough, he turned north to drink from the Great Marsh. Before he reached it, he died of thirst upon the road. He cast aside his staff, which transformed into the Forest of Deng.\n\nKua Fu was the name of a divine being. That he could overtake the sun’s shadow and drain the Yellow River and Wei—was this truly about running and drinking? It was but a metaphor for such acts. Nearly did he achieve the speed of thought, arriving without moving. Here, the one becomes the ten thousand, life and death alternate, and his form vanishes into the Forest of Deng.

      "translated_text": "The State of Bofu lies east of Nie’er. Its people are large, holding a green serpent in the right hand and a yellow serpent in the left. Deng Forest stands to its east—two trees. Another name for it is Bofu.\n\nThe Mountain of Piled Stones, where Yu amassed them, lies to its east, where the Yellow River enters. The River issues from Kunlun, flows hidden beneath the earth, and reemerges at Congling. It pours into the Salt Marsh, then flows on, emerging southward at this mountain to become the River of the Central Lands, and thus empties into the sea. The *Book of Documents* states: \"Yu guided the River past the Piled Stones.\" This speaks of times when it was blocked, so he dredged it to restore its flow.\n\nThe State of Juying lies to its east, where people grasp their cap-strings with one hand. Some say *ying* should be written as *ying* (goiter). Another name is the State of Liying.\n\nThe Xun Tree, a thousand *li* tall, stands south of Juying, growing northwest of the River. *Qi* is pronounced as *qi* (to stand on tiptoe).\n\nThe State of Qizhong lies east of Juying. Its people are large, with large feet, walking so that their heels do not touch the ground. The *Xiao Jing Gou Ming Jue* states: \"The Jiao Yao and Qi Zhong peoples, who come through interpreters to offer tribute.\" Another name is the State of Dazhong.\n\nThe Wilds of Ou Silk lie east of Dazhong. A woman kneels beneath a tree, spitting silk. The tree produces silk—this speaks of eating mulberry leaves and spitting silk, akin to silkworms.\n\nThe Three Mulberry Trees Without Branches stand east of Ou Silk. These trees are a hundred *ren* tall, without branches. All their trunks face upward, each a hundred *ren* in height.\n\nFan Forest, three hundred *li* square, lies east of the Three Mulberries, encircled by islets. These are habitable lands amid the waters, surrounding it.\n\nMount Wuyu: Emperor Zhuanxu was buried on its southern slope. Zhuanxu was called Gaoyang, and his tomb now lies in Puyang, the former Imperial Mound. Another account places it outside the city gate of Poqiu County, in Guangyang Ward. His nine consorts were buried on the northern slope. Some say there are bears, brown bears, striped tigers, Li Zhu, Chi Jiu, and *shirou* (flesh that sees).\n\nPingqiu lies east of the Three Mulberries. Here are found *yi* jade and *yi* jade (jade stones), blue horses, *shirou*, poplars, *ganzu* trees—whose branches and trunks are red, with yellow blossoms, white leaves, and black fruit. The *Lüshi Chunqiu* states: \"East of this mountain grows the *ganzha*.\" Its sound is like *zha* (a kind of pear). The *ganhua* tree also has red branches and trunks with yellow blossoms. A hundred fruits grow in the valley between two mountains, where two great mounds stand in the center, called Pingqiu.\n\nWithin the Northern Sea is a beast resembling a horse, called the *taotu*. In the *Er Ya*, it is pronounced *tao tu*.\n\nThere is a beast named *ju*, shaped like a white horse, with saw-like teeth that devour tigers and leopards. The *Book of Zhou* states: \"The Yi Qu people have white beasts, white as horses, with saw-like teeth that devour tigers and leopards.\" Comparing these accounts, they align with the *Er Ya*.\n\nThere is a white beast resembling a horse, called the *qiongqiong*. This is the *qiongqiong ju xu* (a swift beast), which can run a hundred *li* in one dash, as recorded in the *Mu Tianzi Zhuan*. It is pronounced *qiong*.\n\nThere is a green beast resembling a tiger, called the *luoluo*.\n\nYuqiang of the North has the face of a man and the body of a crow, encircled by two green serpents, treading on two red serpents. His name is Xuanming, the Water Spirit. Zhuang Zhou said: \"Yuqiang stands at the North Pole.\" Another name is Yu Jing. One version states: \"Yuqiang of the North has a black body, hands and feet, and rides two dragons.\"\n\n**Illustrated Praises from the *Classic of Mountains and Seas: Overseas North***\n\n**The State Without Kidneys**\nAll things are passed down—without offspring, there are no roots.\nWithout kidneys, the heart constructs flesh and generates the soul.\nThat this can be so is because those who honor form endure.\n\n**Zhu Long**\nThe northwest is incomplete, where the dragon clashes with fire’s essence.\nIts breath becomes cold and heat, its eye creates dusk and dawn.\nA thousand *li* long, it may be called most divine.\n\n**The State of One Eye**\nAmong the many, this one is not lacking.\nIn the wilds, the blind see clearly, perceiving what lies beyond.\nThe body travels as a guest—what is prized is the subtle.\n\n**The State of Rou Li**\nThe people of Rou Li have bent legs and elbows turned backward.\nIf one seeks a model of grace, none here are ugly.\nWhat is valued is the spirit—what does form matter?\n\n**Xiang Liu, Minister of Gong Gong**\nA minister of Gong Gong, named Xiang Liu.\nEndowed with this strange form, a serpent’s body with nine heads.\nRelying on strength and tyranny, he was ultimately captured by the Xia Lord.\n\n**The State of Deep Eyes**\nThe Deep-Eyed resemble the Hu, but their mouths are extremely sunken.\nWhen the Way of the Yellow Emperor descended, they came through interpreters to submit.\nThose with pierced chests and long legs gather together, though of different clans.\n\n**The State of Nie’er**\nThe State of Nie’er hangs upon the sea islets.\nThe carved tigers serve as envoys—all strange things are seen here.\nTheir forms are mutually dependent, their hands never leaving their faces.\n\n**Kua Fu**\nDivine Kua Fu, difficult to fathom by reason.\nDraining rivers to chase the sun, his form delayed in Deng Forest.\nTransforming by touching kind, responding without fixed intent.\n\n**The Xun Tree**\nTowering is the Xun Tree, growing by the River’s edge.\nIts branches rise a thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and sky.\nIts shade stretches to the four limits, its canopy covering Yu Yuan below.\n\n**The State of Qi Zhong**\nThough their forms are large, their feet stand on tiptoe.\nLeaping like sparrows, their heels never touch the ground.\nResponding to virtue, they come through interpreters to submit to righteousness.\n\n**The Wilds of Ou Silk**\nA woman like the *jiao* people, her body akin to silkworms and clams.\nShe produces pearls without shells, spits silk without cocoons.\nTransformations arise without pattern—how could things have fixed natures?\n\n**The State Without Intestines**\nThe people without intestines have hollow bodies.\nThe heart is the true abode of the spirit; the rest is for external use.\nAttaining the One, they preserve themselves—this principle is shared by all.\n\n**Pingqiu**\nBetween two mountains, the mound is called Ping.\nHere lie *yi* jade, fine blue horses, *shirou*, and *ganhua*.\nStrange fruits grow here.\n\n**Taotu**\nThe wild *taotu* steed comes from the northern lands.\nNecks intertwined, they rub against each other; backs turned, they prance apart.\nThough there were Sun Yang, none could ever tame them.\n\n**Yuqiang of the North**\nYuqiang, the Water Spirit, with a dark face.\nRiding dragons and treading serpents, soaring through clouds with wings.\nSpirit of the mysterious and dark, standing at the North Pole.\n\nThus concludes *The Classic of Mountains and Seas*, Scroll Eight. #1 At \"in Gong Gong’s...\": Collated editions supplement this as \"east of Gong Gong’s terrace.\"",

He shot the ten suns and indeed finished them.\"\n*The Bamboo Annals of Ji Commandery* says: \"When Yin Jia ascended the throne and ruled from the Western River, a portent appeared: ten suns emerged together.\"\nThus, this natural anomaly has its origins.\nThe *Traditions* say: \"Heaven has ten suns; the number of suns is ten.\"\nHere it is said that nine suns dwell on the lower branches and one on the upper.\n*The Classic of the Great Wilderness* further says: \"One sun is just arriving; one sun is just departing.\"\nThough heaven and earth possess ten suns, they are meant to appear in orderly succession, taking turns to illuminate the world. Now, their simultaneous appearance is a celestial omen of disaster. Thus, Yi, entrusted with Yao’s command, poured forth his numinous sincerity, drew his bow to the heavens, and the nine suns withdrew in retreat.\nIf tools can be used to spur water and kindle fire, and if concentrated essence can summon frost and reverse the sun’s course, then Yi’s brilliance in slaying the solar crows was no great difficulty.\nYet by the standards of common reason, this would be deemed impossible.\nBut if one follows the reckoning of numbers, there is nowhere it does not reach.\nThose who perceive with clarity should grasp its profound subtleties, returning them to the depths of understanding.

Another account states that Mount Min-Zhong stands in the sea.\n\n**Mountain of the Three Heavenly Sons** (pronounced *zhang*)\nLocated north of the Min and west of the sea. Today, it lies east of She County in Xin’an, now called Three Kings Mountain, from whose flank the Zhe River issues.

It is said that the Yellow Emperor once visited this place, which was the capital of the Three Heavenly Sons.

The *Great Commentary* records that during the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, the State of Zhou-Mi presented one such being. The *Classic of Lands Within the Seas* refers to them as the Gan-Chen people. Today, in the deep mountains of Nankang Commandery in Jiaozhou, such creatures are still found. They stand over a *zhang* tall, with heels turned backward, swift runners, hair unkempt, and fond of laughter. The females can secrete a fluid that causes illness if it touches a person.

When pulled, its bark peels away like the tassels of a cap or the skin of a yellow serpent. Its leaves resemble gauze, like fine silk. Its fruit resembles the *yue* tree—a tree with a yellow trunk, crimson branches, and verdant leaves, growing on Yunyu Mountain. Some write it as *mao*, others as *ma*, and still others as *yinyue*. This tree is called the *Jian* Tree, standing west of the *yayu* upon the Weak Waters. The *Jian* Tree has azure leaves, a purple stem, black flowers, and yellow fruit.

Its people have human faces and fish bodies, without feet. From the chest upward, they are human; below the chest, they are fish.\n\nThe Ba Serpent devours elephants, disgorging their bones after three years. The noble who wears these bones suffers no ailments of the heart or abdomen. Today, in the south, pythons swallow deer, and once the deer has rotted, the bones pierce through the serpent’s scales as they coil within the tree’s hollow. This is of the same kind. The *Chu Ci* states: “There is a serpent that swallows elephants—how vast must its belly be?” Commentators say it measures a thousand *xun* in length. This serpent is blue, yellow, red, and black. Another account says it is a black serpent with a blue-green head, dwelling west of the rhinoceros.\n\nThe *mao* horse resembles a horse but has hair upon its four joints. The *Mu Tianzi Zhuan* refers to it as the “fine-maned horse,” and there are also *mao* oxen. It dwells northwest of the Ba Serpent, south of the high mountains. The Xiongnu—another name is *Xianyu*.

      "translated_text": "Guo Pu’s Commentary on the *Inner Classic of the Seas*\n\nThe regions from the southwest corner of the inland seas to the north:\n\nThe minister of Erfu was named Wei. Wei and Erfu slew Yayu. The Thearch then shackled him in the Mountain of Sparse Kinsfolk—*gù* meaning to strike and bind, pronounced *huò*. He fettered his right foot with a wooden restraint. His hands were bound behind his back, his hair tied together with them. Thus was he tethered to a tree upon the mountain, which lies northwest of Kaiti.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, men were sent to Shang Commandery to split open a slab of stone. Within the stone chamber they found a man, naked and barefoot, his hair unbound, his hands bound behind him, one foot in fetters. They questioned the assembled ministers, but none could identify him. Liu Zizheng examined this account and matched it to the description. Emperor Xuan was greatly astonished. From that time onward, people vied to study the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*.\n\nMany commentators have held that this was but a simulacrum of his corpse, not the true binding. Yet if one considers the transformations of numinous marvels, they defy rational measurement. All things are endowed with qi, arising from the impossible. They cannot be inferred by ordinary processes, nor gauged by proximate reckoning.\n\nDuring the Wei dynasty, someone opened the ancient tomb of a Zhou king and discovered a woman buried as a sacrificial victim. Neither dead nor alive, she would occasionally draw breath. After several months, she could speak, her appearance that of a woman of twenty or so. She was sent to the capital, where the Empress Dowager took a liking to her and kept her by her side. For over a decade, she remained in attendance. When the Empress Dowager passed away, the woman grieved and wept for ten days before gradually dying. This is of the same category.\n\nAt heart, a great marsh spans a hundred *li*, where flocks of birds are born and shed their feathers.",

      "translated_text": "The balustrades are jade-railed. Nine gates stand upon its face, each guarded by the Openbright Beast; here dwell the hundred spirits. They reside in the corner crags, within the clefts of the rock. At the verge of the Redwater, none but the benevolent Yi could ascend the cliffs of the ridge—meaning that only a man of virtue or one with skills like Yi’s could scale these peaks and crags. Yi once sought the elixir from the Queen Mother of the West, which also speaks to his attainment of the Dao. Some texts render Yi as \"the Sage.\"\n\nThe Redwater issues from the southeast corner, flowing northeast, then southwest to empty into the Southern Sea, quenching the fires of Yan in the east. The Yellow River rises in the northeast corner, flowing north, then southwest into the Bohai Sea, emerging again beyond the sea, turning west and then north to enter the Accumulated Stone Mountain where Yu dredged it. Yu regulated the waters, clearing and channeling them, hence it is said he \"guided the river from the Accumulated Stone.\" The Xiang River (pronounced *xiáng*).\n\nThe Blackwater emerges from the northwest corner, flowing east, then northeast, and south into the sea near the Feathered People. The Weakwater and Bluewater issue from the southwest corner, flowing east, then north, then southwest, passing east of the *bifang* bird. The *Records of the Western Regions* state: Wuyi Kingdom lies over fifteen thousand *li* west of Chang’an, a journey of over a hundred days to the west. The Kingdom of Tiaozhi borders the Western Sea. Elders have passed down tales of Weakwater near the Queen Mother of the West. The *Records of the Eastern Yi* also mention: beyond the Great Wall by several thousand *li*, there is Weakwater—all unseen lands. The *Huainanzi* says: Weakwater flows from Exhausted Stone. Exhausted Stone is present-day Naran in the Western Commandery, likely one of its tributary sources.\n\nSouth of Kunlun lies a deep abyss, three hundred *ren* in depth—the Spirit Abyss. The Openbright Beast resembles a tiger in body (some texts say \"upright\"), with nine heads, each bearing a human face, standing eastward upon Kunlun. It is a celestial beast. The *Rong* states: \"The Openbright Beast, endowed with the essence of *Qian*, gazes upon Kunlun, its might shaking the hundred spirits.\"\n\nWest of the Openbright Beast are phoenixes and *luan* birds, all bearing serpents, treading upon serpents, with red serpents coiled upon their breasts. North of the Openbright Beast stand the Flesh That Sees, the Pearl Tree, the Veined Jade Tree, and the Five-Colored Jade Tree. The *yúqí* tree and *yúyīng* are varieties of red jade. In the first year of the Tianxi era of the Wu Kingdom, Wu Yao, an official of Linhai Commandery, found a stone tree at the edge of the sea, over three *chi* tall, its stem and leaves purple, twisting and bending with a radiant luster—this was a type of jade tree. There also grows the Tree of Immortality, meaning it lives forever.\n\nPhoenixes and *luan* birds all bear shields (pronounced *gē*). There are also the Crimson Light, the Tree-Grain, the Cypress Tree, Sweetwater (the same as the sweet spring), the Sage Tree (eating its fruit grants wisdom), and the *mànduì* (meaning unclear; one text says \"intertwining trees\"). The *Huainanzi* calls it the *xuán* tree, a type of jade.\n\nEast of the Openbright Beast dwell the shamans Peng, Zhi, Yang, Lü, Fan, and Xiang—all divine physicians. The *Genealogical Origins* states: \"Shaman Peng invented medicine.\" The *Chu Ci* says: \"The Thearch commanded Shaman Yang.\" They flank the corpse of *Yayu*, each holding the elixir of immortality to repel death, striving to revive it. *Yayu* has the body of a serpent and the face of a man, slain by the minister of Erfu.\n\nThe *Fuchang* tree has atop it a three-headed man who watches over the *langgan* tree. The nature of the *Fuchang* tree is unclear. The *langgan* fruit resembles pearls. The *Erya* says: \"Among the finest things of the northwest is the *langgan* of Kunlun.\" Zhuang Zhou speaks of a three-headed man who takes turns sleeping and waking to guard the *langgan* and *yúqí* fruit—this refers to that man.\n\nSouth of the Openbright Beast are six-headed tree-birds, *jiao* (serpent-like creatures with four legs, akin to dragons), pythons, *wei* monkeys, leopards, the *zhishu* tree (name unclear), and the *wūbiǎo* trees that mark the edges of the pools (the trees are arrayed to border the pools, which are the Flowered Pools). There are also the Reciting Bird (a bird of unclear form), the *zūn* (a type of eagle), and the *diāo*. The *Tale of King Mu’s Journey* says: \"Here there are white *zūn* and blue *diāo*\" (pronounced like *bamboo shoots*).

      "translated_text": "The Ghost Country lies north of the corpse of Èr Fù, its beings having human faces and a single eye. Another account says the Èr Fù spirit resides to its east, its beings having human faces and serpentine bodies. The *Táo* dog resembles a dog, is blue-green, and makes a sound like \"táo.\" It devours humans starting from the head. Some write it as *qú*. *Qú* means \"head *qú*.\" The *Qióngqí* resembles a tiger, has wings, and bristles like a hedgehog. It devours humans starting from the head, and those it eats have disheveled hair. It dwells north of the *Táo* dog. Another account says it begins from the feet.\n\nThe Terrace of Emperor Yáo, the Terrace of Emperor Kù, the Terrace of Emperor Dānzhū, and the Terrace of Emperor Shùn—each has two terraces, all four-sided—stand northeast of Kūnlún. These were likely places where the Son of Heaven passed during his tours of inspection. The barbarians, admiring the sagely virtue and power, jointly built these terraces and towers to mark and honor his traces. Another version states: Where Xiāngliǔ was slain, the land reeked so foully that the five grains could not be planted, hence the terraces of the many emperors were built there.\n\nThe *Great Wasp* resembles a *lí* (gourd-shaped wasp). The *Zhū É* resembles a moth. *É* refers to the *pífú* (ant). The *Chu Ci* says: \"The dark wasp is like a pot, the red floss like an elephant,\" referring to these. The *Jiǎo* has a human form with tiger stripes and calves with bulging muscles—its legs have *bó* sinews—sounding like \"qiáo.\" It dwells east of the *Qióngqí*. Another account says it resembles a human and is found north of Kūnlún’s ruins. These are the matters recorded above.\n\nThe *Tàfēi* has a human face and a beast’s body, and is blue-green in color, sounding like \"tà.\" Some say it resembles a *chuán* beam. *Zhīshī* has a human form with a broken neck, disheveled hair, and lacks one hand. The *Huánjū* has a beast’s head and a human body. Another account says it resembles a hedgehog-like dog and is yellow. The *Mǒ* has a human body, a black head, and vertical eyes. *Mǒ* is the same as a *mèi* (specter). The *Róng* has a human head with three horns.\n\nThe State of the Lín Clan possesses a rare beast, large as a tiger, with all five colors fully present, its tail longer than its body. It is called *Líwú*, and riding it allows one to travel a thousand *lǐ* in a day. The *Six Strategies* states: \"When King Zhòu imprisoned King Wén, Hóng Yǎo and his followers went to the State of the Lín Clan and obtained this beast, presenting it to Zhòu, who was greatly pleased and thus released Wén.\" The *Book of Zhou* says: \"In Jiā Lín, there is the *Qiú’ěr*, which resembles a tiger, its tail three times the length of its body, and it eats tigers and leopards.\" The *Great Commentary* calls it the *Zhí* beast. *Wú* should be written as *Yú*.\n\nSouth of Kūnlún’s ruins lies the *Fàn* Forest, spanning three hundred *lǐ*. The *Cóngjí* Abyss is three hundred *rèn* deep, where *Bīng Yí* (Píng Yí) eternally resides. *Bīng Yí* is *Féng Yí*. The *Huainanzi* says: \"Féng Yí attained the Dao and submerged himself in the great abyss,\" referring to the River Earl. This is the *Hébó Wúyí* mentioned in the *Tale of King Mu*. The *Bamboo Annals* writes it as *Féng Yí*. The character may also be written as *Bīng*. *Bīng Yí* has a human face and rides two dragons. In paintings, he has four faces, each riding a spirit chariot drawn by two dragons. Another account calls it the *Zhōngjí* Abyss.\n\nThe *Yángwū* Mountain is where the Yellow River originates, as is the *Língmén* Mountain. Both are sources of the river’s tributaries. The corpse of *Wáng Yèyè* has its hands, thighs, chest, head, and teeth all severed and scattered in different places. This is likely a case of bodily dissolution yet spiritual connection, where form diverges but *qi* unites—united yet not intimate, separated yet not distant.\n\nShùn’s wife, Lady *Dēngbǐ*, bore *Xiāomíng* and *Zhúguāng*, the names of her two daughters, so named for their ability to illuminate. They dwell by the great river and marshes, where the waters overflow. The numinous power of the two daughters can illuminate a hundred *lǐ* in all directions. Another account calls her Lady *Dēngběi*.\n\nThe *Gài* State lies south of *Jùyàn* and north of *Wō*, with *Wō* subject to *Yàn*. The *Wō* State is in the great sea east of *Dàifāng*, ruled by a queen. Their custom is to wear their hair loose, their clothing lacks stitching, they paint their bodies with cinnabar, and they are not jealous—one man may have dozens of wives.\n\n*Cháoxiǎn* lies east of *Lièyáng*, north of the sea and south of the mountains. *Lièyáng* belongs to *Yàn Jùlǔ Xiān*, now *Lèlàng* County, the fief of Jīzǐ. *Liè* is also the name of a river, cold in *Dàifāng*, where *Dàifāng* has a *Lièkǒu* County. *Liègūshè* is in the river isles of the sea—a mountain name, where divine beings dwell. The river isles lie in the sea where the river flows. This is the *Miǎo Gūshè* Mountain mentioned in the *Zhuāngzǐ*. The *Gūshè* State is in the sea, belonging to *Liègūshè*, encircled by mountains to the southwest.\n\nThe *Great Crab* dwells in the sea, likely a crab spanning a thousand *lǐ*. The *Língyú* has a human face, human hands and feet, and a fish’s body, dwelling in the sea. The *Great Biān* resides in the sea. *Biān* is the *fáng* fish, sounding like \"biān.\" *Míngzǔ* Village lies in the sea, sounding like \"zǔ.\" *Pénglái* Mountain is in the sea, where immortals’ palaces and chambers are all made of gold and jade.

      "translated_text": "**Guō Pú’s Commentary on *The Classic of Regions Within the Seas: Eastern Lands***\n\n**The Eastern and Northeastern Regions**\nBeyond the northeastern corner lies the land of *Jùyàn*. The states within the Flowing Sands include *Zhǔnduān* (pronounced *dūn*). *Xǐ* (pronounced *huàn*, also written as *茧蠕*) lies southeast of *Kūnlún’s* ruins. Some say it is *Méinèi* Prefecture, though it is not governed as a commandery or county, but rather lies within the Flowing Sands. The states beyond the Flowing Sands include *Dàxià*, whose capital is square and spans two to three hundred *lǐ*, divided into dozens of smaller domains. Its land is fertile and rich, yielding the five grains in abundance. *Jiānshā* and *Jūyáo* (pronounced *yáo*) are part of the *Yuèzhī* kingdom. The *Yuèzhī* are famed for their fine horses and luscious fruits, and their great-tailed sheep, whose tails resemble those of donkeys—these are the *xián* sheep. The *Xiǎoyuèzhī* and *Tiānzhú* (India) are its tributary states.\n\n**The Western Hu and Jade Mountains**\nThe White Jade Mountain of the Western Hu lies east of *Dàxià*, while *Cāngwú* is southwest of the White Jade Mountain. Both are situated west of the Flowing Sands and southeast of *Kūnlún’s* ruins. *Kūnlún* Mountain lies west of the Western Hu, in the far northwest. According to the *Treatise on Geography*, *Kūnlún* Mountain is west of *Línqiāng*, and there stands a shrine to the Queen Mother of the West.\n\n**The Thunder Marsh and Divine Traces**\nWithin the Thunder Marsh dwells the Thunder Spirit, dragon-bodied and human-headed, who drums his belly. It lies west of *Wú*. Today, in *Chéngyáng*, there is *Yáo’s* tomb and the *Língtái* Terrace, with the Thunder Marsh to its north. The *River Chart* states: \"The great footprint lies in the Thunder Marsh, and *Huáxū* trod upon it, giving birth to *Fúxī*.\"\n\n**Islands and Coastal Realms**\n*Dūzhōu* lies in the sea. Another name is *Yùzhōu*. Today, it is within the borders of *Xiōng* County in the Eastern Sea. Legend holds that this mountain migrated from *Cāngwú* in the south, and its summit bears the flora of the southern lands. *Yù* is pronounced *yù*.\n\nThe *Lángyá* Terrace stands between the *Bóhǎi* Sea and the east of *Lángyá*. Today, *Lángyá* is by the sea, where a towering peak rises abruptly, resembling a lofty terrace—this is the *Lángyá* Terrace. *Lángyá* was the capital where *Gōujiàn*, King of *Yuè*, established his hegemony over the Central States. To its north lies a mountain. Some say it is amid the sea.\n\n*Hányàn* is in the sea, south of *Dūzhōu*. *Shǐjiū* is in the sea, south of *Yuánlì*. It is either a state’s name or the name of a bird. *Kuàijī* Mountain lies south of *Dàchǔ*.\n\n**The Three Rivers of Mín**\nThe first of the Three Rivers is the Great River, which rises in *Wèn* Mountain. Today, the river originates in *Kūn* Mountain of *Shēngqiān* County in *Wènshān* Prefecture, flowing southeast through *Jiànwèi* in *Shǔ* Prefecture. It passes northeast of *Jiāngyáng*, then through *Bādōng*, *Jiànpíng*, *Yídū*, *Nánjùn*, *Jiāngxià*, *Yìyáng*, and *Ānfēng*, reaching the southern border of *Lújiāng*. From there, it flows northeast through *Huáinán* and *Xià’nà*, entering the sea at *Guǎnglíng* Prefecture.\n\nThe Northern River rises in *Màn* Mountain, and the Southern River in *Gāo* Mountain. *Gāo* Mountain lies west of *Chéngdū*, and its waters enter the sea south of *Chángzhōu*. The *Zhè* River rises in the *Three Son-of-Heaven Peaks* to its east. According to the *Treatise on Geography*, the *Zhè* River originates in the southern wilds of *Xīn’ān* and *Yí* County, flowing east into the sea. Today’s *Qiántáng* *Zhè* River is the same. *Yí* is now *Shè*, and *Zhè* is pronounced *zhé*.\n\nIn the northwest of *Mǐn*, its waters enter the sea south of *Yújì*. *Yújì* County belongs to *Kuàijī* Prefecture and is now *Yǒngxīng* County. The *Lú* River rises in the *Three Son-of-Heaven Peaks* and flows into the river west of *Péngzé*. *Péngzé* is today’s *Pénglǐ*, in *Péngzé* County of *Xúnyáng*. Some call it *Tiānzǐguō*.\n\nThe *Huái* River rises in *Yú* Mountain, which lies east of *Cháoyáng* and west of *Yìxiāng*, entering the sea north of *Huáipǔ*. Today, the *Huái* River originates in *Tóngbó* Mountain northeast of *Píngshǐ* County in *Yìyáng* Prefecture. It flows through *Rǔnán*, *Rǔyīn*, *Huáinán*, *Qiáoguó*, and *Xià’nà*, entering the sea at *Guǎnglíng* County. *Cháoyáng* County now belongs to *Xīnyě*.\n\nThe *Xiāng* River rises southeast of *Shùn’s* burial site, winding westward around it. *Huán* means \"to encircle.\" Today, the *Xiāng* River originates in *Yángshuò* Mountain of *Yíngdào* County in *Línglíng*, flowing into the river and then into *Dòngtíng* below. *Dòngtíng* is an earthen cavern in *Bālíng* of *Chángshā*. Today, in the great lake south of *Wú* County, there is *Bāo* Mountain, beneath which lies *Dòngtíng*. Its subterranean passages course beneath the water, said to connect everywhere—it is called the \"earth’s veins.\" Some say it is the \"Marsh of the Southeast and West.\"\n\nThe *Hàn* River rises in *Fùyú* Mountain. The *Book of Documents* states: \"*Bōzhǒng* guides the *Yàng*, which flows east to become the *Hàn*.\" According to the *Water Classic*, the *Hàn* River originates in *Lánggǔ* east of *Jǔ* County in *Wǔdū*, flowing through *Hànzhōng* and *Wèixīng* to *Nánxiāng*.

      "translated_text": "**Guo Pu’s Commentary on *The Classic of Mountains and Seas: The Eastern Wilderness***\n\nBeyond the Eastern Sea lies a great chasm. *The Odes, Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"It pours eastward into a bottomless valley.\" This refers to that chasm.\n\nThe land of **Shaohao**. Shaohao was the **Jintian Clan**, an epithet of **Emperor Zhi**. Shaohao nurtured **Emperor Zhuanxu** here—*nurtured* (*ru*), its meaning unclear. He abandoned his zither and se there, for the chasm is said to contain such instruments.\n\nThere is **Gan Mountain**, from which the **Gan River** flows, forming **Gan Abyss**—where waters gather to become a deep pool.\n\nIn the southeastern corner of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Pimu Diqiu**.\n\nBeyond the Eastern Sea, within the Great Wilderness, there is a mountain named **Dayan**, where the sun and moon rise.\n\nThere is **Bogu Mountain**, home to the **Land of Giants**. In the second year of the **Yongjia** era of Jin, a **crane-hawk** alighted in **Aobei Pond**, twenty *li* south of **Shian County**, where the local Zhou Hu captured it. A wooden arrow, tipped with an iron point, pierced it—six and a half *chi* in length. Judging by the arrow’s proportions, the archer must have stood fifteen or sixteen *chi* tall. Furthermore, **Gao Hui**, Vice Prefect of **Pingzhou**, recounted: Travelers from **Wa** were once blown by wind across the sea, where they encountered a land whose people all stood over ten *chi* tall, their forms resembling Hu. These must have been a branch of the **Tall Di**. The arrow likely came from that land.\n\n*The Outer Traditions* state: The **Jiaoyao** people stand three *chi* tall, the shortest of all; the tallest do not exceed ten *zhang*. This is the limit of human stature. According to *The River Chart: Jade Tablet*: Nine thousand *li* north of **Kunlun**, one finds the **Longbo** people, thirty *zhang* tall, who live eighteen thousand years before dying. Ten thousand *li* east of Kunlun lies the land of the **Great Qin**, whose people stand ten *zhang* tall and all wear silk. Another ten thousand *li* east lies the **Tiao** people, three *zhang* and five *chi* tall. Ten thousand *li* beyond them is the **Middle Qin** land, where people stand one *zhang* tall.\n\n*The Guliang Commentary* says: The **Tall Di** measure nine *mu* across the body; when they carry their heads, their brows appear above the crossbar of a chariot. These are the people of several *zhang* in height. In the Qin era, a giant appeared in **Lintao**, five *zhang* tall, with footprints six *chi* long. Judging by these accounts, the stature of such giants cannot be precisely measured.\n\nThere is a **Market of Giants**, called the **Hall of Giants**—also a mountain, shaped like a hall, where giants gather to trade. One giant crouches atop it, stretching his ears wide. *Crouches* (*cun*), sometimes written as *jun*, is an ancient form of *dun*. *The Zhuangzi* says: \"Crouching on **Mount Kuaiji**.\"\n\nThere is a **Land of Little People** called the **Jing People**. *The Odes, Containing the Spirit’s Mist* states: \"In the far northeast live people nine *cun* tall.\" This likely refers to these little people. Sometimes written as *Jing*, the pronunciation is the same.\n\nThere is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body, named **Li Qin** (pronunciation uncertain), the corpse of **Zhi**.\n\nThere is **Jue Mountain** (pronounced like *jue* in *deceit*). The **Yang River** flows from it.\n\nThere is the **Wei Kingdom**, whose people eat millet—this land contains only millet fields. *Wei* is pronounced *wei* (as in *false*).\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **He Xu**, where the sun and moon rise.\n\nThere is the **Zhongrong Kingdom**. **Emperor Jun** begot **Zhongrong**—*Jun* is a phonetic loan for *Shun*. The Zhongrong people eat beasts and the fruits of trees. This land has **red trees** and **black trees**, whose blossoms and fruits are beautiful, as recorded in *The Annals of Lü Buwei*. They employ four beasts: leopards, tigers, bears, and brown bears.\n\nThere is **Eastern Mouth Mountain**.\n\nThere is the **Land of Gentlemen**, whose people wear caps, sashes, and swords. They also employ tigers and leopards, for they value humility and deference.\n\nThere is the **Siyou Kingdom**. **Emperor Jun** begot **Yanlong**, Yanlong begot **Siyou**. Siyou begot **Thoughtful Scholars**, who take no wives, and **Thoughtful Women**, who take no husbands.

There is the **Land of Green Hills**, where foxes with nine tails dwell. They appear as auspicious omens in times of peace.\n\nThere is the **Land of the Gentle Servants**, which is a land of fertile soil. \"Fertile\" here means rich and abundant.

It treads upon two yellow serpents and is named **Yu□**. The Yellow Emperor begot Yu□, and Yu□ begot **Yujing** (also known as **Yujian**).

There is a beast with heads on both left and right, named **□Ti**. It emerges from the **□Ming Nation**—*Chuti* (two readings: *chu* and *ti*). Three azure beasts stand side by side, called **Shuangshuang** (\"Paired\"), their bodies merged as one. This is what the *Gongyang Commentary* refers to as \"arriving in pairs.\"\n\nThere is **A Mountain**. In the midst of the Southern Sea lies **Floating Heaven Mountain**, where the Red Waters reach their end, their flow culminating at this peak. East of the Red Waters lies the **Cangwu Wilds**, where **Shun** and **Shu Jun** are buried. Shu Jun is **Shang Jun**. When Shun died on his imperial tour in Cangwu, he was interred there, and Shang Jun, who remained, was also buried in the same place. Their tombs now lie within the **Nine Doubts**. Here are found **patterned cowries** (purple cowries), **Li Yu** (the same as **Li Zhu**), **□Jiu**, **Ying Jia** (*Jia* being a kind of hawk), **Wei Wei**, bears, brown bears, elephants, tigers, leopards, wolves, and **gazing flesh**.\n\nThere is **Xing Mountain**, from which the **Xing River** flows. South of the **Black Waters** is a **dark serpent** that feeds on dust—modern **South Mountain**’s **Tiao serpents**, which swallow deer, belong to this kind. There is **Wu Mountain**, to its west the **Yellow Bird**. The **Emperor’s Medicines**, eight in number, are stored here—the divine elixirs of the **Celestial Emperor**. The Yellow Bird on Wu Mountain oversees this dark serpent, acting as its guardian.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands **Untended Mountain**, where the Xing River reaches its end. There is a man with three bodies; **Emperor Jun**’s wife, **E Huang**, gave birth to this **Three-Bodied Nation**, likely the origin of their descendants. They bear the **Yao surname**, eat millet, and employ four birds. *Yao* is Shun’s clan name.\n\nThere is a square abyss, its four corners all connected. To the north, it joins the Black Waters; to the south, the Great Wilderness—*shu* here means \"to link.\" Its northern side is called **Shaohe Abyss**, its southern side **Cong Abyss** (*cong* pronounced like the horse *cong*). This is where **Shun bathed**, where he once cleansed himself in its waters.\n\nThere is also **Cheng Mountain**, where the **Sweet Waters** reach their end. The Sweet Waters issue from **Gan Mountain**, their flow culminating here. There is the **Ji Yu Nation**, descendants of **Zhuan Xu**, who eat millet. This land’s people are the progeny of Zhuan Xu. There is the **Feathered People’s Nation**, whose inhabitants are all born with feathers. There is the **Egg-Born Nation**, whose people all hatch from eggs—meaning they are oviparous.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands **Bujiang Mountain**, where the Black Waters reach their end. The Black Waters issue from Kunlun Mountain. There is also **Jia Mountain**, from which the **Qi River** flows. Further, there is **Yan Mountain**, and **Dengbei Mountain** (also called **Dengbao Mountain**, where the multitude of shamans ascend and descend). There is **Jiejie Mountain** (*jie* pronounced like the *qi* in \"contract\"). There is **Pu Mountain**, from which the **Li River** flows, and **Wei Mountain** (*Wei* pronounced like the *wei* in \"Wei Ao\"). To its west lies cinnabar; to its east, jade.\n\nFurther south is a mountain from which the **Piao River** flows (*piao* pronounced like \"whirlwind\"). There is **Wei Mountain** and **Cui Mountain**—this mountain is home to the **kingfisher bird**. There is the **Ying People’s Nation**, of the **Yu surname**, who eat millet. There are also people who feed on tree leaves.\n\nThere is the **Land of Immortals**, of the **A surname**, who eat the **sweetwood**—the sweetwood being the **tree of immortality**, whose consumption prevents aging. Within the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Qu Chi** (\"Departing Convulsions\"). To the south, it bears fruit; to the north, it does not—*qu chi* is pronounced like the *chi* in \"wind convulsions,\" though its meaning is unclear.\n\nOn an islet in the Southern Sea dwells a spirit with a human face, wearing two azure serpents as earrings, named **Bu Ting Hu Yu** (a spirit’s name). There is a spirit named **Yin Yin Hu**, called **Yin Hu** in the south and **Hu Min** by the boastful winds—it has two names. It dwells at the southern pole, controlling the entry and exit of winds.\n\nThere is **Xiang Mountain**, and **Chongyin Mountain** (\"Double Shade\"). There are people who eat beasts, called **Ji Li**. Emperor Jun fathered Ji Li, hence the name **Ji Li Nation**. There is **Min Abyss** (*min* pronounced like \"dusk\"). **Shaohao** fathered **Bei Fa**, who descended to dwell in Min Abyss.\n\nThere are square waters named **Jun Altar**. The waters resemble an earthen altar, hence the name **Shun Altar**. There is the **Zai People’s Nation**. Emperor Shun fathered **Wu Yin**, who descended to dwell here, known as the **Wu Zai People**. The Wu Zai People bear the **Pan surname**, eat grain, yet neither spin nor weave their clothing, nor sow nor reap their food—meaning they have natural cloth and self-growing grains. What is sown is called *jia*; what is reaped is called *se*.\n\nHere are birds that sing and dance: the **luan bird** sings of its own accord, the **phoenix** dances of its own accord. Here gather a hundred beasts, living in herds. Here the hundred grains converge.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Rongtian** (\"Heaven-Fusing\"), where the sea’s waters enter from the south. There is a man called **Zaochi** (\"Chisel-Teeth\"), whom **Yi** slew—meaning Yi shot and killed him. There is **Yu Mountain**. There is the **Yu People’s Nation** (*yu* pronounced like the same). They bear the **Sang surname**, eat millet, and feed on **yu**—*yu* being the **short fox**, resembling a turtle, which spits sand to shoot people, causing illness and death. This mountain produces them, hence its name.\n\nThere is a man drawing a bow, shooting a yellow serpent, named the **Yu Archer**. There is **Song Mountain**, home to a red serpent called the **Green Serpent**. A tree grows upon this mountain, named **maple**—the maple is what **Chi You**’s shackles transformed into after Chi You was captured by the Yellow Emperor, bound, and executed. His discarded bonds became this tree, now called the maple—today’s **fengxiang tree**.\n\nThere is a man with tiger’s teeth and a tiger’s tail, named **Zu Zhuang’s Corpse** (*zu* pronounced like the *za* in \"wild pear\"). There are little people, the **Jiao Yao Nation**, of the **Ji surname**, all three *chi* tall, who eat **fine grains**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **□Tu Mountain** (*tu* pronounced like \"rot\"). The **Azure Waters** reach their end here. The Azure Waters issue from Kunlun Mountain.

This is likely a tomb built according to the customs of a foreign land.\n\nHere abound **long-lasting turtles**, **patterned cowries**, **liyu birds**, **luan birds**, **phoenixes**, and creatures great and small—all things are fully present. **Azure birds**, **lang birds**, **dark birds**, **yellow birds**, **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, **brown bears**, **yellow serpents**, **flesh that sees**, **xuangui jade**, and **yaobi jade** all emerge from **Weiyu Mountain**, which lies at its edge.\n\nThere is a mound, three hundred *li* in circumference. South of the mound stands **Emperor Jun’s Bamboo Grove**, where the bamboo is so large a single segment may serve as a boat. South of the bamboo grove lies a crimson marsh, its waters dyed red, called **Fengyuan**—*feng* meaning \"great crimson.\" There are three mulberry trees without branches, each a hundred *ren* tall to the south.\n\nWest of the mound lies **Chenyuan**, where the customs of **Zhuanxu’s Hu Buyu Kingdom** persist—a land later known only by name. Today, the small tongues of the Hu and Yi peoples all speak thus. They bear clan names and eat millet.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Bu Xian**. There lies the kingdom of **Sushen**. Today, the land of Sushen lies over three thousand *li* from Liaodong, where its people dwell in caves, wear no clothing, and clothe themselves in pigskins. In winter, they anoint their bodies with grease, several *fen* thick, to ward off wind and cold. Their people are all skilled in crafting red bows, four *chi* long and exceedingly strong. Their arrows are made of *hu* wood, one *chi* and eight *cun* long, with arrowheads of green stone—these are the arrows received by Marquis Chi of Chen in the Spring and Autumn period. In the second year of the Taixing era of Jin, Governor Cui Kun of Pingzhou dispatched his aide Gao Hui to present bows and arrows of the Sushen people, whose arrowheads were made of bone. When asked, they said these were obtained through trade with inland kingdoms. Today, it is called the **Yiling Kingdom**, which produces fine sable and red jade—perhaps these come from the outer sea. The *Book of Later Han* refers to it as the **Yilou Kingdom**.\n\nThere are **fei zhi**, creatures with four wings. *Fei* is pronounced *zhi* in another reading. There are also insects with the heads of beasts and the bodies of serpents, called **qin insects**—a kind of serpent. There is a man called the **Elder**. There is the **Kingdom of the Elder**, whose people bear the clan name Li and eat millet.\n\nThere is a great green serpent with a yellow head that devours deer. Today, in the south, the python also eats deer, and deer belong to the same kind as the *tang* beast. There is **Yu Mountain**. There is **Xuan Gun’s Attack on Chengzhou Mountain**—both mountains are named after their legends.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Hengtian**. There is **Xianmin Mountain**. There is a **pan tree** a thousand *li* in extent. There is the kingdom of **Shu Chu**—*chu* is pronounced *gan*, or *chu* in another reading. They are descendants of **Zhuanxu**, with millet for heads, and they employ four beasts: **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, and **brown bears**. There is a black creature resembling a bear, called the **zhu zhu**—or sometimes written as *lang*, pronounced *xi*.\n\nThere is the kingdom of **Qi**, of the Jiang clan, which employs **tigers**, **leopards**, **bears**, and **brown bears**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Guang Kan’s Great Feng Mountain**, where the **River** and the **Ji** enter, flowing north into the sea. After the River and Ji empty into the sea, they re-emerge beyond the sea in this mountain. To its northwest lies **Yu’s Accumulated Stones**, also called **Qingyang Mountain**.\n\nThere is **Shun Mountain**, from which the **Shun River** flows. There is the kingdom of **Shizhou**. There is **Cinnabar Mountain**, which yields pure cinnabar. The *Bamboo Annals* state: \"He Jia conquered and obtained a mountain of cinnabar.\" Today, cinnabar is also mined from mountains and earthen caves.\n\nThere is a great marsh a thousand *li* in extent, where the **Zhang Bird** sheds its feathers. The *Tale of King Mu* says: \"Arriving at the vast plains, where flying birds shed their feathers, he hunted birds and beasts, taking the finest specimens, and loaded a hundred chariots with feathers.\" The *Bamboo Annals* also records: \"King Mu marched north, traversing a thousand *li* of flowing sands, amassing feathers for a thousand *li*—all referring to this marsh.\"\n\nThere is the **Kingdom of the Hairy People**, whose inhabitants all have human faces and bodies covered in hair. They bear the clan name Yi, eat millet, and employ four beasts. **Yu** begot the kingdom of **Jun**, **Jun** begot **Yi Lai**, **Yi Lai** begot **Xun Jia**—*jia* is pronounced *dan xia*. **Xun Jia** killed the **Chuo people**—*Chuo* being their name. The Emperor, moved by this, secretly established a kingdom for them, concealing its origins. These are the Hairy People.\n\nThere is the **Kingdom of the Pendulous-Eared**, of the Ren clan, whose people have large ears that hang down, resting on their shoulders. The Vermilion Bird’s **Dian Er** carvings depict ears reaching the shoulders, imitating these people. **Yu Hao’s son** eats grain. It is said that on the islets of the Northern Sea, they cultivate millet to sustain themselves—this refers to **Yu Qiang**.\n\nThere is a spirit with a human face and a bird’s body, wearing two green serpents as earrings and treading upon two red serpents, named **Yu Qiang**.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **North Pole’s Heavenly Accumulation**—*ji* is pronounced *yi*—where the northern waters of the sea flow. There is a spirit with nine human heads and a bird’s body, named the **Nine Phoenixes**. There is another spirit that holds serpents in its mouth and grasps serpents in its hands, with the head of a tiger, the body of a man, four hooves, and long elbows, named **Qiang Liang**—also among the dreaded beasts.\n\nWithin the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Chengdu’s Loaded Heaven**. There is a man who wears two yellow serpents as earrings and holds two yellow serpents in his hands, named **Kua Fu**. **Houtu** begot **Xin**, **Xin** begot **Kua Fu**.

He then raced toward the Great Marsh, yet before he arrived, he perished here—dying of thirst. After **Yinglong** had slain **Chiyou**, he also killed **Kua Fu**. Above it is said that Kua Fu, overestimating his strength, competed with the sun and died; here it is again said that he was slain by Yinglong. His death has no fixed account, for events are recorded as they arise, making clear that his transformations are boundless and beyond measure.\n\nYinglong then departed to dwell in the south, and so the south has abundant rain. It speaks of dragons as creatures of water, for like attracts like. There is the **Land of the Gutless**, which belongs to the **Ren** clan. Its people are tall. They have no heirs, and they eat fish. *Ji* is also written as *qi*, referring to the intestines. **Gonggong’s** minister was named **Xiangyao**—also called **Xiangliu**, with the name’s sound shifting in speech. He had nine heads and a serpent’s body, coiling upon himself, meaning he was twisted and spiraled. He fed upon nine mountains, speaking of his greed and savagery. Wherever he dwelled, it became barren—*ni* and *ya*, like the sound of spitting and choking, meaning he stopped up the land. Thus it became a source of marshes, speaking of his great strength. His misfortune brought suffering, for his qi was harsh and fierce. No beast could inhabit the same place, speaking of the fear he inspired.\n\nWhen **Yu** dammed the floodwaters, he killed Xiangyao. Yu blocked the vast deluge, drowning him in the process. His blood was foul and reeking, unable to nurture grain, and his land was waterlogged, unfit for habitation. It speaks of how his fat and blood flowed and pooled into abysses. Yu dammed it, piling earth three times and sinking three times—speaking of Yu’s earthen barriers and the serpent’s collapse into the soil. He then turned it into a pool. The land was parched, so the **Di** emperors took advantage of this to build a terrace, for low ground is suitable for accumulation. Thus the many emperors came together here to construct the terrace. It lies north of **Kunlun**.\n\nThere is a mountain called **Yue Mountain**, where **Xun bamboo** grows—great bamboo. In the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain named **Buju**, where the northern sea waters flow in. There is **Xikun Mountain**, where **Gonggong’s Terrace** stands. Archers dare not face north toward it, speaking of the fear it inspires. There is a person clad in blue-green robes, named **Ba**, the daughter of the **Yellow Emperor**—*ba* is pronounced like *drought*. When Chiyou forged weapons to attack the Yellow Emperor, the Yellow Emperor commanded Yinglong to strike him in the wilds of **Jizhou**—Jizhou being the central land. The Yellow Emperor also trained tigers, leopards, bears, and brown bears to battle **Yan Di** in the wilds of **Banyuan**, annihilating him. See the *Records of the Grand Historian*.\n\nYinglong stored up water, while Chiyou summoned the **Wind Earl** and **Rain Master**, bringing forth a great storm. The Yellow Emperor then sent down the heavenly maiden **Ba**, and the rain ceased, allowing him to slay Chiyou. Ba could not return above, and wherever she dwelled, there was no rain, for the drought’s qi remained. **Shu Jun** spoke of this to the emperor, who later banished her to the north of the **Red Waters**, exiling her far away. Shu Jun then became the **Field Ancestor**, overseeing the fields. As the *Book of Songs* says: *“The Field Ancestor is divine.”* Ba was at times lost, for she feared being driven away. Those who wished to expel her commanded the Field Ancestor to proceed northward toward the water’s position. First, they cleared the waterways, dredging and connecting ditches and channels. It speaks of how driving her away would bring rain, so they first improved the waterways—this is the origin of today’s practice of expelling Ba.\n\nThere is a people who are eating fish, named the **Land of the Deep-Eyed**. They belong to the **Xi** clan and eat fish. They are also of the **Hu** kind, though their eyes are deeply set, for the Yellow Emperor’s time reached them. There is **Zhong Mountain**, where a woman clad in blue-green robes is named **Xian**, the maiden of the **Red Waters**—a divine woman.\n\nIn the midst of the Great Wilderness stands a mountain called **Rongfu Mountain**, where the waters flow in order. There is a people named the **Dog Rong**. The Yellow Emperor begot **Miaolong**, Miaolong begot **Rongwu**, Rongwu begot **Bianming**, Bianming begot the **White Dog**, and the White Dog had two dogs, male and female, meaning they paired among themselves. Thus they became the Dog Rong, who harm and devour. There is a red beast there, formless and headless, named **Rongxuanwang’s Corpse**—the spirit name of the Dog Rong.\n\nThere is a mountain called **Qizhou Mountain**, also known as **Zeng Mountain**—*zeng* is pronounced *qian*—**Xianye Mountain**, and **Yu Mountain**. There is a people with a single eye, growing in the center of their face. Another account says they belong to the **Wei** clan, descendants of **Shaohao**, and eat millet. There are the **Jiwujiwu** people of the **Ren** clan—*ji* is also written as *qi*, meaning the navel—who have no bones and eat qi and fish. It speaks of the existence of boneless people. The *Master Shi* says: *“King Xu of Xu had sinews but no bones.”*\n\nEast of the **Flowing Sands** beyond the northwest sea lies a land called **Zhonglun**, descendants of **Zhuanxu**, who eat millet. There is a land named **Laiqiu**. There is the **Land of the Dog Rong**. There is a spirit with a human face and beast’s body, also named the **Dog Rong**.\n\nNorth of the **Black Waters** beyond the northwest sea dwell winged people, named the **Miao People**—the people of the **Three Miao**. Zhuanxu begot **Huantou**, Huantou begot the Miao People, who belong to the **Li** clan. There is a mountain named **Zhang Mountain**. In the Great Wilderness stand **Heng Stone Mountain**, **Nine Yin Mountain**, and **Huiye Mountain**, upon which grows a red tree with green leaves, named **Bitter Artistry**. It stands at the western extremity of Kunlun, its leaves glowing red and illuminating the earth below.\n\nThere is the **Land of the Niu Li**. There are people without bones, the **Dang’erzi**—the Dang’er people give birth to boneless children. North of the **Red Waters** beyond the northwest sea stands **Zhangwei Mountain**. There is a spirit with a human face and a red serpent’s body, a thousand *li* in length. His eyes are straight and aligned, though the meaning of *zheng cheng* is unclear. When he closes his eyes, it is dark; when he opens them, it is bright—speaking of how his sight brings day and his closure brings night. He does not eat, does not sleep, does not rest, and summons wind and rain. It speaks of his power to invoke wind and rain. He illuminates the **Nine Yin**, shining upon the hidden depths of the Nine Yin. Thus he is called **Zhulong**. The *Li Sao* says: *“Where the sun does not reach, how does Zhulong shine?”* The *Han of the Divine* says: *“The northwest of the world is incomplete, lacking the ebb and flow of yin and yang, so there is a dragon holding the essence of fire to illuminate the midst of the Heavenly Gate.”*",

Kua Fu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow and pursued it to **Yu Valley**—the ravine where the sun is said to set.",

The *Shi Ben* says: \"Xi Zhong made carts.\" This text says Ji Guang, showing that father and son jointly created the design, hence their interchangeable mention.\n\n**Shaohao** begot **Ban** (pronounced *ban*), who was the first to make bows and arrows. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Mou Yi made arrows, and Ze made bows.\" Since arrows are one thing, and yet both are credited with their creation, there is doubt in the account. This text says Ban made them.\n\n**Emperor Jun** bestowed upon **Yi** a vermilion bow and white-feathered arrows—a vermilion bow and stone-tipped arrows fletched with white feathers. The *Wai Zhuan* says: \"The white-feathered arrows, when seen from afar, resemble a field of *tu* (pronounced *tu*).\" He did so to aid the states below, meaning Yi used archery to eliminate calamities and assist the subordinate states. Yi was the first to relieve the myriad hardships of the lower lands, such as slaying the **Chisel-Teeth** and the **Fengshi**.\n\n**Yi of Youqiong** usurped and shot, hence his name. **Emperor Jun** begot **Yanlong**, and Yanlong was the first to make the **qin** and **se**. The *Shi Ben* says: \"Fuxi made the qin, and Shennong made the se.\"\n\nEmperor Jun had eight sons, who were the first to create song and dance.\n\nEmperor Jun begot **Shen**, Shen begot **Yijun**, and Yijun was the first to become **Chui the Artisan**, thus beginning the myriad crafts of the common people.",
