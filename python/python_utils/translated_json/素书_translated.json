  "full_translation": "**The Unadorned Book**\n\n**Chapter One: Origins**\nThe Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual—these five are of one body.\nThe Dao is that which people tread, enabling the myriad things to proceed without knowing their source.\nVirtue is that which people attain, enabling the myriad things each to obtain what they desire.\nBenevolence is that to which people draw near, possessing a heart of compassion, wisdom, and pity to nurture their existence.\nRighteousness is that which is fitting for people, rewarding good and punishing evil to establish merit and accomplish deeds.\nRitual is that which people practice, rising early and retiring late to perfect the order of human relations.\nTo be the foundation of humanity, one cannot lack a single one of these.\nThe worthy and the noble understand the Dao of prosperity and decline, comprehend the principles of success and failure, discern the trends of order and chaos, and grasp the logic of advance and retreat.\nIf one acts when the time is ripe, one may ascend to the highest rank of minister; if one moves when the opportunity arises, one may achieve unparalleled merit.\nIf one does not meet with such circumstances, one’s life passes in obscurity.\nThus, their Dao is lofty enough, and their name is revered by later generations.\n\n**Chapter Two: The Upright Dao**\nVirtue sufficient to embrace the distant, trust sufficient to unify the disparate, righteousness sufficient to win the multitude, talent sufficient to reflect on the past, and clarity sufficient to illuminate those below—these are the traits of the outstanding.\nConduct sufficient to serve as a model, wisdom sufficient to resolve doubts, trustworthiness sufficient to uphold agreements, and integrity sufficient to distribute wealth—these are the traits of the eminent.\nUpholding one’s duties without neglect, abiding by righteousness without wavering, facing suspicion without careless avoidance, and encountering profit without improper gain—these are the traits of the exceptional.\n\n**Chapter Three: Seeking the Will of Others**\nAbandoning cravings and restraining desires removes encumbrances.\nSuppressing wrongdoing and diminishing evil deflects transgressions.\nDiminishing wine and forgoing sensuality prevent defilement.\nAvoiding suspicion and keeping distance from doubt prevent error.\nBroad learning and earnest inquiry expand knowledge.\nLofty conduct and subtle speech refine the self.\nReverence, frugality, humility, and restraint preserve one’s integrity.\nDeep planning and far-reaching consideration prevent distress.\nDrawing near to the benevolent and befriending the upright aids in recovery from adversity.\nApproaching others with forbearance and steadfast conduct fosters harmonious relations.\nEmploying talent and utilizing ability aid in serving others.\nExhausting evil and expelling slander prevent disorder.\nExamining the past to verify the present prevents confusion.\nFirst measuring, then assessing, enables response to sudden events.\nImplementing change and exercising flexibility resolve entanglements.\nGathering one’s resources and aligning with circumstances prevent misfortune.\nFirmness and integrity establish merit.\nDiligence and goodness preserve one’s end.\n\n**Chapter Four: Honoring the Dao as the Root of Virtue**\nThe will is the art of solitary action.\nThose who perish in longevity perish through excessive scheming; those who perish in peace perish through inability to endure humiliation; those who perish in priority perish through failure to cultivate virtue; those who perish in joy perish through delight in goodness; those who perish in spirit perish through lack of utmost sincerity; those who perish in clarity perish through failure to embody things; those who perish in fortune perish through lack of contentment; those who perish in suffering perish through excessive desires; those who perish in sorrow perish through dissipation of essence; those who perish in illness perish through impermanence; those who perish in brevity perish through improper gain; those who perish in obscurity perish through greed and baseness; those who perish in solitude perish through self-reliance; those who perish in peril perish through trusting the doubtful; those who perish in defeat perish through excessive self-interest.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Dao and Righteousness**\nThose who enlighten others while remaining in darkness, those unaware of their own faults, those who stray without returning, those who incur resentment through words, those whose commands contradict their hearts, those whose later orders contradict earlier ones, those whose anger lacks authority, those who delight in humiliating others, those who execute or humiliate their subordinates, those who disrespect what they should revere, those who appear united but are inwardly divided, those who befriend slanderers and distance the loyal, those who draw near to sensuality and distance the worthy, those who allow women to interfere in governance, those who appoint private favorites to office, those who overpower subordinates to prevail, and those whose reputation does not match reality—all decline.\nThose who demand much of others while neglecting themselves cannot govern; those who are generous to themselves but stingy with others are abandoned. Those who discard merit because of faults suffer loss; those whose subordinates outwardly dissent fall into ruin; those employed but not entrusted grow distant; those who begrudge rewards dampen morale; those who promise much but give little breed resentment; those who welcome then reject create discord.\nThose who bestow little but expect much receive no return; those who forget their humble origins do not endure. Those who cherish the old and discard new merit court misfortune; those who employ people improperly face peril; those who forcefully use others cannot retain them; those who assign offices based on personal preference cause chaos; those who lose their strengths grow weak; those who decide policies through unbenevolent means court danger; those whose secret plans are leaked suffer defeat; those who heavily tax but meagerly bestow cause decline.\nWhen warriors are impoverished and wandering scholars are wealthy, the state declines; when bribes are openly exchanged, the state is benighted. Those who overlook goodness but remember faults are tyrannical; those who cannot trust the trustworthy or entrust the untrustworthy are corrupt.\nGoverning people with virtue gathers them; governing with punishment scatters them.\nIf small merits go unrewarded, great merits will not arise; if small grievances go unaddressed, great grievances will surely emerge. Rewards that do not satisfy and punishments that are not accepted breed rebellion. Rewarding the undeserving and punishing the innocent is cruelty.\nThose who praise slander and resent remonstrance perish. Those who secure what is rightfully theirs find peace; those who covet what belongs to others bring ruin.\n\n**Chapter Six: Peace and Ritual**\nResentment arises from not forgiving small faults; calamity arises from not planning ahead.\nFortune lies in accumulating goodness; misfortune lies in accumulating evil.\nHunger arises from neglecting agriculture; cold arises from abandoning weaving.\nSecurity lies in obtaining the right people; danger lies in losing the right affairs.\nWealth lies in welcoming opportunity; poverty lies in forsaking the times.\nWhen superiors lack constancy, subordinates grow suspicious.\nDisrespecting superiors invites punishment; humiliating subordinates forfeits their loyalty.\nWhen close ministers are not esteemed, distant ministers despise them.\nThose who doubt others because of self-doubt, and those who trust others because of self-trust.\nCrooked scholars have no upright friends; devious superiors have no forthright subordinates.\nA state in peril has no worthy people; a disordered government has no good people.\nThose who deeply love others urgently seek the worthy; those who delight in the worthy generously nurture others.\nWhen a state is about to rise, all scholars flock to it; when a state is about to fall, the worthy flee first.\nBarren land does not yield great things; shallow water does not sustain large fish; barren trees do not shelter great birds; sparse forests do not harbor great beasts.\n\nSteep mountains collapse; full marshes overflow.\nThose who discard jade for stone are blind; those with a sheep’s nature clad in a tiger’s hide are weak.\nGarments worn without lifting the collar are worn backward; those who run without watching the ground will stumble.\nWeak pillars bring houses to ruin; weak ministers bring states to ruin.\nCold feet harm the heart; people’s resentment harms the state.\nWhen mountains are about to collapse, their base erodes first; when a state is about to decline, its people are impoverished first.\nWithered roots rot the branches; a troubled people breaks the state.\nThose who follow the tracks of overturned carts will overturn; those who imitate the deeds of fallen states will perish.\nSeeing what has already arisen, be cautious of what is to come; hating a path, one must avoid it.\nThose who fear danger remain safe; those who fear destruction endure.\nIn all that one does, following the Dao brings fortune; straying from the Dao brings misfortune.\nFortune is where a hundred blessings gather; misfortune is where a hundred disasters strike.\nNot by divine sagacity, but by the natural convergence of things.\nThose who diligently plan good strategies encounter no evil affairs; those who lack foresight face immediate troubles.\nThose of like minds find one another; those of like benevolence share one another’s sorrows; those of like malice form factions; those of like affection seek one another; those of like beauty envy one another; those of like wisdom scheme together; those of like rank harm one another; those of like interests envy one another; those of like voices respond to one another; those of like qi resonate with one another; those of like kind depend on one another; those of like righteousness befriend one another; those who share hardship aid one another; those who share the Dao perfect one another; those of like skills correct one another; those of like craftsmanship compete with one another—these are the patterns that govern outcomes, and they cannot be defied by reason.\nThose who abandon themselves yet instruct others act perversely; those who rectify themselves yet transform others act in accord.\nPerversity is hard to follow; accord is easy to practice. Hard to follow, it brings disorder; easy to practice, it brings order.\nThus may one govern the self, the state, and the household.",
