  "full_translation": "**Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic*\n**Volume:** One\n**Authorship:** Anonymous, likely composed during the Song or Yuan dynasties.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Great Mystery Section*\n\n---\n\nThe *Divine Chamber* is the pivot of the elixir. Mercury is the parent of all minerals. Cinnabar and mercury dwell apart, emerging from yang and entering yin, their radiance flowing between the two directions. Their numerical arrangement is three, and they lodge in the images of water and fire.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*.\"\nThis speaks of the *Divine Chamber* as the pivot of the elixir—the *Divine Chamber* is none other than Qian and Kun. In the human body, Qian corresponds to the head, and Kun to the abdomen, which together are called the upper and lower crucibles. Thus, the head is the Upper Cinnabar Field, and the abdomen encompasses the Middle and Lower Cinnabar Fields. The elixir is likened to the *Yi*, the Dipper and ten hexagrams to the multitude of minerals, and cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li. Li is the sun, yang, and functions through emergence; Kan is the moon, yin, and functions through entry. Kan belongs to water and is numbered one; Li belongs to fire and is numbered two. Together, they make three, hence the phrase \"lodging in the images of water and fire.\"\n\n**Chapter One**\nRule is established by the king: with martial force, he suppresses rebellion; with civil virtue, he pacifies the realm. He reigns through the power of earth, wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions. Kan and Li, numbered one and two, stand as the warp of south and north, thus crowning them as the chief among the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft possess outer and inner aspects, and yin and yang are endowed by nature. The Kun and Gen hexagrams govern the center to regulate the exterior—this is the meaning of the king’s suppression of rebellion and pacification of the realm. Wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions is the way of covering and veiling yin and yang. Taking south-Li and north-Kan as the warp and the other hexagrams as the weft, they form sixty hexagrams, distributed within thirty days to emulate the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a celestial year. Thus, the sixty hexagrams are likened to the seventy-two minerals. Qian is hard, Kun is soft; Kan is yang, Li is yin—all naturally serve as each other’s outer and inner aspects.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nMetal and fire take their turn in service; metal and water mutually contain and receive. Male and female unite as one body, and their use follows an ordered pattern.\n\nThe tenth chapter of the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The most luminous of manifest images are none greater than the sun and moon.\"\nThis classic compares it thus: \"The most luminous in the flourishing of the elixir are none greater than metal and fire\"—meaning metal and fire are Kan and Li. Kan is kidney-water, and the phase born of water is metal. Li is the heart, and the phase belonging to the heart is fire. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of *Zhun* taking its turn in service and *Meng* knowing reception; here, it speaks of metal and fire taking their turn in service, and metal and water mutually containing and receiving. Now, *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk are the emanations of Kan and Li into the sixty hexagrams, beginning with these two hexagrams. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* speaks of their function, while this text speaks of their essence. As for the interplay of female and male giving rise to the sixty hexagrams, they form a complete whole. Extending from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Ji Ji* and *Wei Wei*, within a single month, the sixty hexagrams cycle through—how could this not follow an ordered pattern?\n\n**Chapter Three**\nTransformations reach their utmost mystery; when the end comes, they begin anew. The ninth line marks the measure, and yang harmony aligns with the sun’s dawn and dusk.\n\nFrom the first to the ninth, and from the sixteenth to the sixth: nine is the birth of yang, and six is the birth of yin. Nine begins at *zi* and extends to *si*; six begins at *wu* and extends to *hai*—hence the alignment with dawn and dusk.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe cyclic reckoning accords with the celestial mind. Yang lines conclude at *si*; true yin emerges from Li at *wu*, ending at *ding* and concluding at *hai*.\n\nThis passage speaks of the twelve months as the fire of the year. From *Fu* to *Qian* is yang; from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nWater and fire array in a single direction, guarding their boundaries to form cold and heat. East and west manifest benevolence and righteousness; the Five Phases transform the four seasons. Thus, yin and yang interact in their functions, following the Three Ones to attain their principle.\n\nWater governs the north, fire governs the south. Yang is born at *zi*, yin is born at *wu*—cold and heat are founded here. East governs spring, west governs autumn. Spring gives birth, autumn brings decline. Only yang, born at *zi*, reaches *mao* and grows mighty, thus embodying the way of extending benevolence. Yin, born at *wu*, reaches *you* and waxes in power, thus bearing the symbol of stripping away. When benevolence is extended, it resembles the sprouting of buds and the flight of crystals; when righteousness is established, it draws from the stripping away to nourish the root. Thus, yin and yang each fulfill their fivefold functions. The Three are the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver above; the One is the fluid of the kidneys below. The Four all originate from the earth of the central palace—hence the *Cantong Qi* states that the Five Phases attain their principle.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *Divine Chamber* establishes its positions, and transformations occur within it.\n\nThe *Divine Chamber* is the upper and lower crucibles. \"Establishing positions\" refers to the precise arrangement of female and male pairings. \"Transformations\" refer to cinnabar and mercury—cinnabar and mercury are the two functions of metal and earth. These two functions have no fixed position: *Zhang* and *Yi* fly to *Xu* and *Wei*, coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence. Dwelling alone, they do not alter; transformed, they return to the central palace, enveloping all minerals to become the ancestral origin of the elixir.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"Compare Qian and Kun to the *Divine Chamber*; pair yin and yang with female and male; liken cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li.\" It further pairs metal and earth with Qian and Kun—Qian is metal, Kun is earth—thus taking Kan and Li as the two functions of Qian and Kun, and comparing cinnabar and mercury to the two functions of metal and earth. *Zhang* and *Yi* are the south; *Xu* and *Wei* are the north. \"Coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence\" refers to the two substances, cinnabar and mercury, uniting as one body. From this, the hundred bones, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels all arise—just as Kan and Li extend and transform into the sixty hexagrams. Thus, they envelop the ten thousand things, and none are unaware of their advance.\n\nChapter Seven:\nPresence and absence mutually restrain; the Vermilion Bird flames in the void, the purple radiance shines upon the sun, and cinnabar and mercury vanish away. *The Union* compares the vanishing of Kan and Li to the vanishing of cinnabar and mercury—since the sixty hexagrams originate from Kan and Li, just as the golden elixir originates from cinnabar and mercury. Once the hexagrams are formed, Kan and Li are no longer of use, just as when the elixir transforms into purple radiance, cinnabar and mercury are no longer employed. Thus, the *Elixir Canon* states: \"Use lead yet do not use lead; one must act within lead.\" Here, the true fire is the true lead.\n\nChapter Eight:\nThe method is not casually devised; the principle is not idly established. Condensing the text to unfold its profundities, one knocks and seeks the numinous, expounding the lines to verify the hexagrams, and reciting the five phases. Kan is the male essence of metal; Li is the female radiance of fire. Metal and fire contend; water and earth overcome one another. Earth flourishes in the domain of metal, and the three substances perish together. The four seas converge like spokes to establish great peace, all proceeding from the central palace—the merit of the Yellow Emperor’s virtue of earth. *The Union* states: \"Kan is the essence of the moon, Wu; Li is the radiance of the sun, Ji.\" This corresponds to Kan as the male essence of metal and Li as the female radiance of fire. What is concealed within Kan becomes metal, while its outward flow transforms into water; what is concealed within Li becomes fire, yet when it emerges, it combines with the fluids of the spleen to become earth. Though Kan’s metal and Li’s fire contend, and water and fire overcome one another, they also serve as husband and wife in this way. The spleen, belonging to earth, resides between the heart and lungs, first generating the metallic fluid of the lungs; thus, the lung’s fluid in turn generates in this manner. When metal, water, and earth all fall into the realm of emptiness and nothingness, the *Forty-One Chapters* is therefore called *Entering Directly into the Void*. Only after all three perish can Kan and Li’s Wu and Ji circulate the sixty hexagrams, arriving from the four directions like the four seasons bringing things to completion. How can this not be a great achievement!\n\nChapter Nine:\n\nGold and fire are true lead, and in the art of the elixir, nothing is more luminous than gold and fire. By exhausting the subtle to follow transformation, yang moves and yin dissolves. When primal chaos ends in nine and one, the precious crucible alternates in mutual support. Together they comprise three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, with each *zhu* corresponding to one *jin*, and one *jin* being sixteen *liang*.\n\nWhen the essence of gold undergoes one transformation, the Azure Dragon receives the tally. At this moment, the divine spirits refine its essence, and fire and metal mutually propel one another. The male yang is the verdant mystery-water, the female yin is the ochre yellow gold. Yin and yang intermingle and unite, their essence and fluids enveloping the primordial *qi*. The myriad forms arise from emptiness, each responding to transformation according to its kind. The numinous efficacy of all elixirs draws near, and none fail to attain longevity through this.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* displays its images with clarity, and nothing is greater than the sun and moon.\" Comparing this to the luminous safeguarding of the elixir, nothing is greater than gold and fire. Gold and fire are what Chapter Nine refers to as Kan’s metal and Li’s fire. Thus, Li is the sun and yang, Kan is the moon and yin. From the first day of the new moon onward, the moon receives the sun’s light, and the moon begins to wax. By the time of the first quarter, yin and yang are each half, and the three yin and three yang have yet to intermingle. After the first quarter, yang *qi* grows robust and seeks out yin. By the fifteenth day, the upper three yin have all intermingled to become yang.\n\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the pregnant fullness of the moon again seeks out yang. By the time of the last quarter, the three yang have all transformed into yin, and the three yin and three yang at last separate into two. Thus, from the first quarter to the last quarter, all is the time of primal chaos in mutual union. Those who practice refinement therefore gather half a *jin* of gold after the waxing yang of the first quarter, and gather half a *jin* of water before the robust yin of the last quarter. Half a *jin* is eight *liang*, one *liang* is twenty-four *zhu*, and thus the combined *zhu* of sixteen *liang* can correspond to the complete lines of the *Yi*!\n\nOnce gold and water are united and transformed into one, within the divine chamber they must emulate the waxing and waning numbers of yin and yang. Applying fire to refine them, the golden elixir is thus accomplished. The phrase \"fire and metal mutually propel one another\" refers to their ceaseless movement.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\nHereupon, the Primal Lord begins to refine mercury. The divine chamber contains cavernous emptiness, and the mysterious and white become the Metal Duke, towering at the inception. Adorning the Three and Five to guard one another, the soaring essence then moistens and nourishes.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* compares the divine chamber to Qian and Kun, calling them the upper and lower crucibles. Mercury is born of Li, lead is born of Kan, and together they become husband and wife—just as the *Guan Ju* speaks of the queen and her consort as the origin of proper marriage. The Three and Five are Kan and Li. Only after the soaring essence is moistened and nourished can they guard one another, just as husband and wife unite, necessarily beginning from the first year.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n\nThe Mysterious Woman expounds their sequence: Wu and Ji value the celestial tally. When the celestial tally’s Dao gradually unfolds, the stripping away is difficult to align with the mysterious diagram. Thus, she expounds the intent of the elixir, and Qian and Kun are no longer mentioned.\n\nWu and Ji are Kan’s Wu and Li’s Ji. The celestial tally is the unfolding of the sixty hexagrams, corresponding to the waxing and waning of yin and yang within thirty days. Yet when yang *qi* reaches the thirtieth day, it is entirely stripped away. If it were to end in complete stripping, it would be insufficient for the use of the mysterious diagram. Only because its revolutions are inexhaustible, with no going that is not also a return, can it be employed to expound the applications of the elixir.\n\nIn the human body, the head is Qian, the abdomen is Kun, the heart is Li, and the kidneys are Kan. Excluding these four hexagrams, the remaining sixty hexagrams are used as the celestial tally. Thus, Wu and Ji, Qian and Kun, are no longer mentioned.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n\nCinnabar flows as the mercury father, Wu and Ji are the yellow gold mother. The bell and pitch-pipe return to two and six, the Dipper’s pivot establishes three and nine. The Red Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon.\n\nWhen Kun first changes into Zhen, on the third day the moon emerges at Geng. East and west divide at Mao and You, and the Dragon and Tiger naturally seek one another. When Kun changes again into Dui, on the eighth day the moon emerges at Ding—this is the first quarter, and the gold is half a *jin*. When Kun changes a third time into Qian, on the fifteenth day the three yang are complete. Round and radiant, it illuminates the east at Jia, and metal and water moisten the Great Yang. The red marrow flows as mercury, and the Crone plays with the bright cauldron.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n\nThe moon’s fullness naturally wanes. On the sixteenth day, its motion begins to decline. When Qian first wanes into Xun, at dawn the moon appears at Xin. When Qian wanes again into Gen, on the twenty-third day it is the last quarter—this is the last quarter, and the water is half a *jin*, the moon emerging south at Bing. When Qian changes a third time into Kun, on the thirtieth day at Kun-Yi, in the northeast it loses its companion, and the moon sets at the Yi position.\n\nWhen the moon at Kun-Yi is already obscured, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, the Zhen Dragon is born. Cinnabar and mercury are the seventh segment, referring to Kan and Li. Earlier, it was said that Kan and Li crown the seventy-two stones, and thus this is the yellow gold mother. All elixir stones are born of Kan and Li, hence it is said that the myriad forms arise from emptiness.\n\nThe twelve pitch-pipes are the fire of the year. The Dipper’s pivot first points to Chen and last to Xu, hence it is said to establish three and nine. The Red Youth is the spirit of the heart; the Vermilion Bird is the spirit of fire; the Azure Dragon is the eastern Zhen hexagram.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n\nQian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian, and Qian gives birth to Xun, Gen, and Kun. The eight hexagrams array their luminaries, shifting without losing the center. Regulating the fire for sixty days, the transformations naturally serve as proof.\n\nThat Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end means that in the beginning, when there was yet no heaven and earth, there was only a vast and undifferentiated emptiness. When yang *qi* first sprouts within this emptiness, it is like Kan arising within pure Kun. Thus, Kun ends and Kan begins. When Kan’s upper birth transforms into Zhen and Dui, reaching Qian, the light and pure body is completed above!\n\nWhen yang *qi* reaches its utmost extreme, yin *qi* already sprouts within pure yang—just as Li arises within pure Qian. Thus, Qian ends and Li begins. As Li descends and transforms into Xun and Gen, reaching Kun, the heavy and turbid essence congeals below. This is how heaven and earth come into being.\n\nYet this scripture speaks of regulating the fire for sixty days, which does not match the *Cantong Qi*’s method of morning and evening progressions through *Zhun* and *Meng*, advancing to *Ji* and *Wei*, and from dusk to dawn—this better accords with the workings of creation.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\n\nThe sacred chamber has its correspondences:\nHard as an egg to contain,\nFive Peaks stand in hidden caverns,\nTheir convergence forming the pivot’s hinge.\n\nAt first kindling, the fire is gently warm,\nLike the stirring of a hexagram’s line.\nAbove, it bears the essence of golden yang;\nBelow, it carries the form of Kun’s origin.\nWithin, flowing mercury harmonizes,\nBlending in accord with the Three Powers.\n\nQian moves, circulating the Three Luminaries;\nKun rests, containing yang *qi*.\nOnly when the sacred chamber is employed\nDoes the Golden Elixir then take form.\n\nHow could one not strengthen the vessel of refinement,\nEncompassing flight and coagulation,\nOpening and closing the numinous portal—\nThe treasury of the subtle and invisible?\n\nThe Five Peaks are the five viscera;\nThe caverns speak of what is concealed.\nThe essence of golden yang is Qian’s origin above;\nKun is the earth’s form below.\nFlowing mercury is the five metals;\nThe Three Luminaries are Li (sun), Kan (moon), and the five stars.\nThus the *Cantong Qi* says: the *Hetu*’s patterns are the celestial writ,\nWhile earth’s form is Kun’s origin.\nThe human heart discerns heaven and earth,\nDrawing forth the elixir—\nAll are called the Three Powers.\nThe vessel’s treasury is the Elixir.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\n\nThe furnace of creation, the spring cavern:\nYang *qi* emerges from Kun.\nThe sundial points to the southern extreme,\nFive stars align in a pearl-strung line,\nSun and moon conjoin as jade discs,\nGolden sand adheres to its measure,\nBreath and response harmonize.\n\nThe spring cavern is the region of the kidneys;\nKan governs the kidneys—\nHere, the first yang sprouts within pure yin.\nIn the moon, this is the *jianzi* month;\nIn time, it is midnight.\nThus, when the five stars align in a pearl-strung line,\nIt signifies the five viscera’s treasures coming to life.\nOnly then, after the sun and moon conjoin as jade discs,\nDoes one fix the weight by measure\nTo gather cinnabar and mercury into the sacred chamber.\n\nAt the sun, one speaks of exhalation;\nAt the moon, of inhalation—\nAs the *Huangting Jing* says: sunrise and sunset, moon’s breath and intake, are preserved thus.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\n\nThe Flowery Canopy looms above,\nThe Three Terraces lend support below.\nThe office of oversight must be tightly sealed,\nIts scrutiny unrelenting in discerning success or failure.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen**\n\nThe Flowery Canopy is where the lord of men oversees all below—\nFor Qian resides at the head above, issuing decrees to the realm.\nThe Terraces and Assistants are Kan and Li, who carry out the lord’s commands,\nAiding and supporting him, overseeing and recording,\nEach governing their respective domains,\nLest any leak or breach occur.\nOne must also examine their competence before employing them—\nThis is the exhalation of the old and inhalation of the new.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\n\nFire refines the earth of the Central Palace;\nMetal enters the water of the Northern Quarter.\nEarth, water, and metal—these three substances,\nTransform over sixty days,\nA natural essential: radiance preserved, decay averted.\nIf the measure of earth is excessive, its weight defies the norm;\nIf the water’s grains are unsteady, they share a place yet dwell apart.\nHard and soft resist each other, refusing to intermingle—\nNot the fault of fire, but the rebuke falls upon earth.\nEarth guards the Central Palace, the dragon’s canopy spanning the four directions.\n\nWhen fire refines the earth of the Central Palace,\nThe heart’s fluid emerges to meet the spleen’s fluid, transmuting into earth.\nMetal is the lung’s fluid, entering the Gate of Mysterious Femininity\nTo meet the kidney’s fluid—thus it enters.\nThe Northern Quarter is water.\nThus, earth, water, and metal first reside within the Three Palaces,\nThen enter the Cinnabar Field, where they transform into the Golden Elixir.\nHence, radiance is preserved, decay averted.\n\nIf the measure of earth is too great, or the water’s grains unstable,\nHard and soft will resist, dwelling together yet never uniting—\nHence, they dwell apart.\nThis is not the failure of fire to refine the Golden Elixir,\nBut the fault of earth’s excess.\nOnly when earth’s measure is proper\nCan the Dragon, Tiger, Lead, and Mercury mutually engender and perfect one another.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\n\nWhen the Three Luminaries align in measure, great peace is achieved;\nThe five viscera are inwardly nourished, the four limbs harmonized.\nWater’s form vanishes, its radiance inwardly bright;\nMetal and water gleam together, sealing and submerging their brilliance.\nRegulating fire to warm water, all is transformed when activated—\nThe Way is near and may be sought.\n\nThe Three Luminaries are the moon of Kan, the sun of Li, and all metallic substances.\nWhen extracted, each must conform to its measure,\nNeither exceeding nor falling short—\nThus can great peace be attained.\nOnly with measured extraction can the surplus be used\nTo nourish the five viscera inwardly, harmonizing the four limbs.\n\nIf the water of the Kan Palace is firmly controlled, preventing reckless leakage,\nIts form naturally dries within, its shadow unseen—\nExtinguished yet without trace of advance.\nThus, the radiance of metal and water gleams inwardly bright,\nSinking and concealing within to nourish the four limbs.\nThis is what the *Huangting Jing* calls the \"inner master of the six palaces and the ninefold source of fluids.\"\nIf one further regulates fire to warm it,\nAll will transform into the Inner Elixir—\nHow could this not be near at hand?\n\nWater and earth alone pair together,\nLike kingfishers birthing auspicious clouds.\nYellow and black blend their essences,\nPurple blossoms unfurl in the great yang.\nWater alone gives birth to the myriad things—\nOnly the sage truly knows this.\n\nEarth is the spleen, water the kidneys;\nThese two palaces share the same function,\nThus are said to pair.\n\"Kingfishers and auspicious clouds\" speak of the five hues complete.\nWhat causes the fluids of these two palaces to meet within the cinnabar field,\nTransforming into the Purple Gold Elixir,\nVying in radiance with the great yang?\n\nNow, the spleen can refine the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver,\nInwardly nourishing the five viscera, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures.\nCultivators may know this,\nBut only if water is not recklessly leaked\nDoes it naturally flow inward to irrigate the four limbs, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures,\nGiving birth to the myriad things—\nNone but the sage can know this.\nThus the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The world does not understand.\"\n\n---\n\nGold’s virtue reveres white;\nRefining lead seeks the yellow hue.\nStimulated, it arises in the Central Palace,\nMolten gold does not fly.\nScorching earth raises clouds of smoke,\nPresence and absence mutually restrain.\nAbove dwells the Azure Dragon,\nThe two non-existences honor the one existence—\nSpiritual transformation, wondrous and hard to fathom.\n\nGold here refers to what is called below \"silver, the essence of gold.\"\nLead is gold’s mother.\nRefining lead to seek the yellow hue:\nWithin Kan lies Wu,\nFor Kan is born from pure Kun,\nThus possessing earth’s nature.\nRefined by fire, it becomes yellow gold.\nThus the *Cantong Qi* says: \"First liquid, then congealed,\nCalled the Yellow Ascension.\"\nOnly with the yellow hue\nCan it stimulate the earth of the Central Palace to generate it,\nCongealing without flight.\n\nThe \"presence\" is Kan’s yang,\nAlso called the Tiger,\nThe moon’s essence.\nThe Azure Dragon is the liver’s hun,\nCalled \"dragon\" for its power of transformation.\nThe fire of Li Palace can further refine it,\nThus it is said: \"The two non-existences honor the one existence.\"\n\n---\n\nRefining silver from lead,\nSpiritual beings naturally arise.\nSilver is the essence of gold,\nLead the northern spirit.\nWater is the pivot of the Dao,\nIts number named One,\nThe beginning of yin and yang—\nThus it can generate silver.\n\nLead transforms into yellow cinnabar,\nLodging in the five metals.\nLead’s exterior is black,\nIts color endowed by the north.\nWithin it harbors silver’s essence,\nWearing coarse cloth while holding jade—\nOutwardly resembling a madman.\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: \"Know the white, guard the black,\nAnd the numinous brightness will come of itself.\"\nWhite is the essence of gold,\nBlack the foundation of water.\nOnly by guarding this watery foundation\nCan the essence of gold arise from it.\nThus it is said: \"The numinous brightness comes of itself.\"\nThis is the five phases moving contrary to their sequence—\nGold being born within water.\n\nAs for lead’s transformation into yellow cinnabar,\nIt lodges in the position of the five metals.\nThis is the twenty-second segment,\nThe \"stimulation giving rise to the Central Palace.\"\nFrom this perspective,\nMutual generation proceeds without end.\n\n---\n\nSilver is lead’s child,\nThe child hidden within lead.\nLead is silver’s mother,\nThe child concealed in the mother’s womb.\nSubtle and distant, the pristine truth,\nSeeming to exist, seeming not—\nIn the ash pool, scorched by flame,\nLead sinks, silver floats.\nPure white, the treasure appears,\nCapable of forging yellow gold.\n\nLead gives birth to silver,\nAnd in the beginning, silver lies within lead—\nLike a child in the mother’s womb.\nNo form to be seen,\nNo boundary to be sought.\nFor example, when smelting silver in an ash pool,\nLead is used to draw it out.\nWhen the fire’s heat intensifies,\nLead sinks and silver emerges.\n\nNow, the silver within Kan\nIs further refined by the crescent moon’s fire,\nThen lead naturally sinks and silver naturally floats.\nThe treasure appears, pure and white,\nAnd when further refined,\nYellow gold can be forged.\n\n---\n\nThe husk is the essence of gold,\nWater encircles the yellow liquid.\nA substance the width of an inch\nMixes the Three Powers.\nBefore heaven and earth divided,\nAll was mixed like a chicken’s egg,\nRound and high at the center,\nResembling Penglai’s gourd.\nSealed with subtle tightness,\nThe spirit works within.\nThe furnace and cauldron take their form from this,\nFirmly enclosed, perfectly secure.\n\nThe husk is the essence of gold—\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: \"Use gold as the embankment.\"\nThis gold is that born of the lead mother.\n\"Water encircles the yellow liquid\":\nThe water is that born of Li Palace,\nThe pure water of the Jade Pool.\nThe \"yellow liquid\" is the fluid of the spleen.\n\"A substance the width of an inch\" is the cinnabar field.\nThe Three Powers:\nLi originates from Qian,\nKan originates from Kun,\nThe spleen stands in the center, symbolizing humanity.\n\nWhen heaven and earth had not yet divided,\nAll was mixed like a chicken’s egg.\nWith the spirit moving within,\nIt could transform into the ten thousand things of heaven and earth—\nThe furnace and cauldron truly take their form from this.\n\n---\n\nBy winding restraint, ensure no mishap,\nFollowing the principle of nature,\nSpiritual transformation knows no bounds.\nThe lodestone attracts iron,\nThough barriers lie between, they secretly connect.\nHow does the dead hen’s egg,\nWhen matched, give birth?\nGold and earth’s virtue\nAlways accompany mercury.\n\n\"Winding restraint\" is what the *Cantong Qi* calls the \"winding corridor\"—\nThe tail’s closed gate.\nThough the lodestone and iron may be separated by objects,\nThey still secretly connect.\nHow much more so with the furnace and cauldron,\nWhich naturally possess winding restraint,\nMutually controlling and uniting like the hen’s egg’s pairing?\n\nGold is Qian, metal, dwelling above;\nEarth is Kun, soil, dwelling below;\nMercury is humanity, dwelling in the center.\nIn the tenth segment of this scripture,\nGold and fire were called \"lead,\"\nBut in this chapter, only mercury is mentioned.\nGenerally, the fluids of heart and kidneys\nAll emerge as the supreme treasure,\nThus they are collectively termed lead and mercury.\n\n---\n\nThe *Fire Record* was not written in vain.\nWith solemnity, it explains the preceding text.\nOnce the elixir art is revealed,\nNo further doubt remains.\nThus this formula is expounded\nTo append to the *Fire Record*,\nSo that learners may grasp its imagery without confusion.\n\nThe *Fire Record* and *Cantong Qi* explain the *Dragon-Tiger Scripture*.\nAt the twenty-sixth segment,\nLamenting that later students fail to understand,\nThey compose the *Fire Record*’s preface at the end.\n\nThis statement, solemnly explicating the preceding text, refers to the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth segments, which revisit the matters of the fourth and fifth segments. Here ends the commentary on the *Dragon-Tiger Upper Scripture* of the ancient text.",

      "translated_text": "**Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic**\n\n**Title:** *Commentary on the Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Classic*\n**Volume:** One\n**Authorship:** Anonymous, likely composed during the Song or Yuan dynasties.\n**Source:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Great Mystery Section*\n\n---\n\nThe *Divine Chamber* is the pivot of the elixir. Mercury is the parent of all minerals. Cinnabar and mercury dwell apart, emerging from yang and entering yin, their radiance flowing between the two directions. Their numerical arrangement is three, and they lodge in the images of water and fire.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"Qian and Kun are the gateways of the *Yi*.\"\nThis speaks of the *Divine Chamber* as the pivot of the elixir—the *Divine Chamber* is none other than Qian and Kun. In the human body, Qian corresponds to the head, and Kun to the abdomen, which together are called the upper and lower crucibles. Thus, the head is the Upper Cinnabar Field, and the abdomen encompasses the Middle and Lower Cinnabar Fields. The elixir is likened to the *Yi*, the Dipper and ten hexagrams to the multitude of minerals, and cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li. Li is the sun, yang, and functions through emergence; Kan is the moon, yin, and functions through entry. Kan belongs to water and is numbered one; Li belongs to fire and is numbered two. Together, they make three, hence the phrase \"lodging in the images of water and fire.\"\n\n**Chapter One**\nRule is established by the king: with martial force, he suppresses rebellion; with civil virtue, he pacifies the realm. He reigns through the power of earth, wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions. Kan and Li, numbered one and two, stand as the warp of south and north, thus crowning them as the chief among the seventy-two minerals. Hard and soft possess outer and inner aspects, and yin and yang are endowed by nature. The Kun and Gen hexagrams govern the center to regulate the exterior—this is the meaning of the king’s suppression of rebellion and pacification of the realm. Wielding the sword and sheathing the halberd to stabilize the four directions is the way of covering and veiling yin and yang. Taking south-Li and north-Kan as the warp and the other hexagrams as the weft, they form sixty hexagrams, distributed within thirty days to emulate the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a celestial year. Thus, the sixty hexagrams are likened to the seventy-two minerals. Qian is hard, Kun is soft; Kan is yang, Li is yin—all naturally serve as each other’s outer and inner aspects.\n\n**Chapter Two**\nMetal and fire take their turn in service; metal and water mutually contain and receive. Male and female unite as one body, and their use follows an ordered pattern.\n\nThe tenth chapter of the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The most luminous of manifest images are none greater than the sun and moon.\"\nThis classic compares it thus: \"The most luminous in the flourishing of the elixir are none greater than metal and fire\"—meaning metal and fire are Kan and Li. Kan is kidney-water, and the phase born of water is metal. Li is the heart, and the phase belonging to the heart is fire. The *Cantong Qi* speaks of *Zhun* taking its turn in service and *Meng* knowing reception; here, it speaks of metal and fire taking their turn in service, and metal and water mutually containing and receiving. Now, *Zhun* at dawn and *Meng* at dusk are the emanations of Kan and Li into the sixty hexagrams, beginning with these two hexagrams. Thus, the *Cantong Qi* speaks of their function, while this text speaks of their essence. As for the interplay of female and male giving rise to the sixty hexagrams, they form a complete whole. Extending from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Ji Ji* and *Wei Wei*, within a single month, the sixty hexagrams cycle through—how could this not follow an ordered pattern?\n\n**Chapter Three**\nTransformations reach their utmost mystery; when the end comes, they begin anew. The ninth line marks the measure, and yang harmony aligns with the sun’s dawn and dusk.\n\nFrom the first to the ninth, and from the sixteenth to the sixth: nine is the birth of yang, and six is the birth of yin. Nine begins at *zi* and extends to *si*; six begins at *wu* and extends to *hai*—hence the alignment with dawn and dusk.\n\n**Chapter Four**\nThe cyclic reckoning accords with the celestial mind. Yang lines conclude at *si*; true yin emerges from Li at *wu*, ending at *ding* and concluding at *hai*.\n\nThis passage speaks of the twelve months as the fire of the year. From *Fu* to *Qian* is yang; from *Gou* to *Kun* is yin.\n\n**Chapter Five**\nWater and fire array in a single direction, guarding their boundaries to form cold and heat. East and west manifest benevolence and righteousness; the Five Phases transform the four seasons. Thus, yin and yang interact in their functions, following the Three Ones to attain their principle.\n\nWater governs the north, fire governs the south. Yang is born at *zi*, yin is born at *wu*—cold and heat are founded here. East governs spring, west governs autumn. Spring gives birth, autumn brings decline. Only yang, born at *zi*, reaches *mao* and grows mighty, thus embodying the way of extending benevolence. Yin, born at *wu*, reaches *you* and waxes in power, thus bearing the symbol of stripping away. When benevolence is extended, it resembles the sprouting of buds and the flight of crystals; when righteousness is established, it draws from the stripping away to nourish the root. Thus, yin and yang each fulfill their fivefold functions. The Three are the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver above; the One is the fluid of the kidneys below. The Four all originate from the earth of the central palace—hence the *Cantong Qi* states that the Five Phases attain their principle.\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe *Divine Chamber* establishes its positions, and transformations occur within it.\n\nThe *Divine Chamber* is the upper and lower crucibles. \"Establishing positions\" refers to the precise arrangement of female and male pairings. \"Transformations\" refer to cinnabar and mercury—cinnabar and mercury are the two functions of metal and earth. These two functions have no fixed position: *Zhang* and *Yi* fly to *Xu* and *Wei*, coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence. Dwelling alone, they do not alter; transformed, they return to the central palace, enveloping all minerals to become the ancestral origin of the elixir.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"Compare Qian and Kun to the *Divine Chamber*; pair yin and yang with female and male; liken cinnabar and mercury to Kan and Li.\" It further pairs metal and earth with Qian and Kun—Qian is metal, Kun is earth—thus taking Kan and Li as the two functions of Qian and Kun, and comparing cinnabar and mercury to the two functions of metal and earth. *Zhang* and *Yi* are the south; *Xu* and *Wei* are the north. \"Coming and going without constancy, rising and falling without permanence\" refers to the two substances, cinnabar and mercury, uniting as one body. From this, the hundred bones, nine orifices, five viscera, and six bowels all arise—just as Kan and Li extend and transform into the sixty hexagrams. Thus, they envelop the ten thousand things, and none are unaware of their advance.",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Seven:\nPresence and absence mutually restrain; the Vermilion Bird flames in the void, the purple radiance shines upon the sun, and cinnabar and mercury vanish away. *The Union* compares the vanishing of Kan and Li to the vanishing of cinnabar and mercury—since the sixty hexagrams originate from Kan and Li, just as the golden elixir originates from cinnabar and mercury. Once the hexagrams are formed, Kan and Li are no longer of use, just as when the elixir transforms into purple radiance, cinnabar and mercury are no longer employed. Thus, the *Elixir Canon* states: \"Use lead yet do not use lead; one must act within lead.\" Here, the true fire is the true lead.\n\nChapter Eight:\nThe method is not casually devised; the principle is not idly established. Condensing the text to unfold its profundities, one knocks and seeks the numinous, expounding the lines to verify the hexagrams, and reciting the five phases. Kan is the male essence of metal; Li is the female radiance of fire. Metal and fire contend; water and earth overcome one another. Earth flourishes in the domain of metal, and the three substances perish together. The four seas converge like spokes to establish great peace, all proceeding from the central palace—the merit of the Yellow Emperor’s virtue of earth. *The Union* states: \"Kan is the essence of the moon, Wu; Li is the radiance of the sun, Ji.\" This corresponds to Kan as the male essence of metal and Li as the female radiance of fire. What is concealed within Kan becomes metal, while its outward flow transforms into water; what is concealed within Li becomes fire, yet when it emerges, it combines with the fluids of the spleen to become earth. Though Kan’s metal and Li’s fire contend, and water and fire overcome one another, they also serve as husband and wife in this way. The spleen, belonging to earth, resides between the heart and lungs, first generating the metallic fluid of the lungs; thus, the lung’s fluid in turn generates in this manner. When metal, water, and earth all fall into the realm of emptiness and nothingness, the *Forty-One Chapters* is therefore called *Entering Directly into the Void*. Only after all three perish can Kan and Li’s Wu and Ji circulate the sixty hexagrams, arriving from the four directions like the four seasons bringing things to completion.

      "translated_text": "Gold and fire are true lead, and in the art of the elixir, nothing is more luminous than gold and fire. By exhausting the subtle to follow transformation, yang moves and yin dissolves. When primal chaos ends in nine and one, the precious crucible alternates in mutual support. Together they comprise three hundred and eighty-four *zhu*, with each *zhu* corresponding to one *jin*, and one *jin* being sixteen *liang*.\n\nWhen the essence of gold undergoes one transformation, the Azure Dragon receives the tally. At this moment, the divine spirits refine its essence, and fire and metal mutually propel one another. The male yang is the verdant mystery-water, the female yin is the ochre yellow gold. Yin and yang intermingle and unite, their essence and fluids enveloping the primordial *qi*. The myriad forms arise from emptiness, each responding to transformation according to its kind. The numinous efficacy of all elixirs draws near, and none fail to attain longevity through this.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: \"The *Yi* displays its images with clarity, and nothing is greater than the sun and moon.\" Comparing this to the luminous safeguarding of the elixir, nothing is greater than gold and fire. Gold and fire are what Chapter Nine refers to as Kan’s metal and Li’s fire. Thus, Li is the sun and yang, Kan is the moon and yin. From the first day of the new moon onward, the moon receives the sun’s light, and the moon begins to wax. By the time of the first quarter, yin and yang are each half, and the three yin and three yang have yet to intermingle. After the first quarter, yang *qi* grows robust and seeks out yin. By the fifteenth day, the upper three yin have all intermingled to become yang.\n\nFrom the sixteenth day onward, the pregnant fullness of the moon again seeks out yang. By the time of the last quarter, the three yang have all transformed into yin, and the three yin and three yang at last separate into two. Thus, from the first quarter to the last quarter, all is the time of primal chaos in mutual union. Those who practice refinement therefore gather half a *jin* of gold after the waxing yang of the first quarter, and gather half a *jin* of water before the robust yin of the last quarter. Half a *jin* is eight *liang*, one *liang* is twenty-four *zhu*, and thus the combined *zhu* of sixteen *liang* can correspond to the complete lines of the *Yi*!\n\nOnce gold and water are united and transformed into one, within the divine chamber they must emulate the waxing and waning numbers of yin and yang. Applying fire to refine them, the golden elixir is thus accomplished. The phrase \"fire and metal mutually propel one another\" refers to their ceaseless movement.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\nHereupon, the Primal Lord begins to refine mercury. The divine chamber contains cavernous emptiness, and the mysterious and white become the Metal Duke, towering at the inception. Adorning the Three and Five to guard one another, the soaring essence then moistens and nourishes.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* compares the divine chamber to Qian and Kun, calling them the upper and lower crucibles. Mercury is born of Li, lead is born of Kan, and together they become husband and wife—just as the *Guan Ju* speaks of the queen and her consort as the origin of proper marriage. The Three and Five are Kan and Li. Only after the soaring essence is moistened and nourished can they guard one another, just as husband and wife unite, necessarily beginning from the first year.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n\nThe Mysterious Woman expounds their sequence: Wu and Ji value the celestial tally. When the celestial tally’s Dao gradually unfolds, the stripping away is difficult to align with the mysterious diagram. Thus, she expounds the intent of the elixir, and Qian and Kun are no longer mentioned.\n\nWu and Ji are Kan’s Wu and Li’s Ji. The celestial tally is the unfolding of the sixty hexagrams, corresponding to the waxing and waning of yin and yang within thirty days. Yet when yang *qi* reaches the thirtieth day, it is entirely stripped away. If it were to end in complete stripping, it would be insufficient for the use of the mysterious diagram. Only because its revolutions are inexhaustible, with no going that is not also a return, can it be employed to expound the applications of the elixir.\n\nIn the human body, the head is Qian, the abdomen is Kun, the heart is Li, and the kidneys are Kan. Excluding these four hexagrams, the remaining sixty hexagrams are used as the celestial tally. Thus, Wu and Ji, Qian and Kun, are no longer mentioned.\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n\nCinnabar flows as the mercury father, Wu and Ji are the yellow gold mother. The bell and pitch-pipe return to two and six, the Dipper’s pivot establishes three and nine. The Red Youth plays with the Vermilion Bird, transforming into the Azure Dragon.\n\nWhen Kun first changes into Zhen, on the third day the moon emerges at Geng. East and west divide at Mao and You, and the Dragon and Tiger naturally seek one another. When Kun changes again into Dui, on the eighth day the moon emerges at Ding—this is the first quarter, and the gold is half a *jin*. When Kun changes a third time into Qian, on the fifteenth day the three yang are complete. Round and radiant, it illuminates the east at Jia, and metal and water moisten the Great Yang. The red marrow flows as mercury, and the Crone plays with the bright cauldron.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n\nThe moon’s fullness naturally wanes. On the sixteenth day, its motion begins to decline. When Qian first wanes into Xun, at dawn the moon appears at Xin. When Qian wanes again into Gen, on the twenty-third day it is the last quarter—this is the last quarter, and the water is half a *jin*, the moon emerging south at Bing. When Qian changes a third time into Kun, on the thirtieth day at Kun-Yi, in the northeast it loses its companion, and the moon sets at the Yi position.\n\nWhen the moon at Kun-Yi is already obscured, earth, wood, and metal are about to transform. Following Kun, the Zhen Dragon is born. Cinnabar and mercury are the seventh segment, referring to Kan and Li. Earlier, it was said that Kan and Li crown the seventy-two stones, and thus this is the yellow gold mother. All elixir stones are born of Kan and Li, hence it is said that the myriad forms arise from emptiness.\n\nThe twelve pitch-pipes are the fire of the year. The Dipper’s pivot first points to Chen and last to Xu, hence it is said to establish three and nine. The Red Youth is the spirit of the heart; the Vermilion Bird is the spirit of fire; the Azure Dragon is the eastern Zhen hexagram.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n\nQian and Kun encompass beginning and end. Over thirty days, Kun gives birth to Zhen, Dui, and Qian, and Qian gives birth to Xun, Gen, and Kun. The eight hexagrams array their luminaries, shifting without losing the center. Regulating the fire for sixty days, the transformations naturally serve as proof.\n\nThat Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end means that in the beginning, when there was yet no heaven and earth, there was only a vast and undifferentiated emptiness. When yang *qi* first sprouts within this emptiness, it is like Kan arising within pure Kun. Thus, Kun ends and Kan begins. When Kan’s upper birth transforms into Zhen and Dui, reaching Qian, the light and pure body is completed above!",

and auspicious clouds\" speak of the five hues complete.\nWhat causes the fluids of these two palaces to meet within the cinnabar field,\nTransforming into the Purple Gold Elixir,\nVying in radiance with the great yang?\n\nNow, the spleen can refine the fluids of the heart, lungs, and liver,\nInwardly nourishing the five viscera, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures.\nCultivators may know this,\nBut only if water is not recklessly leaked\nDoes it naturally flow inward to irrigate the four limbs, the hundred bones, and the nine apertures,\nGiving birth to the myriad things—\nNone but the sage can know this.\nThus the *Cantong Qi* says: \"The world does not understand.\"\n\n---\n\nGold’s virtue reveres white;\nRefining lead seeks the yellow hue.\nStimulated, it arises in the

existence—\nSpiritual transformation, wondrous and hard to fathom.\n\nGold here refers to what is called below \"silver, the essence of gold.\"\nLead is gold’s mother.\nRefining lead to seek the yellow hue:\nWithin Kan lies Wu,\nFor Kan is born from pure Kun,\nThus possessing earth’s nature.\nRefined by fire, it becomes yellow gold.\nThus the *Cantong Qi* says: \"First liquid, then

the pivot of the Dao,\nIts number named One,\nThe beginning of yin and yang—\nThus it can generate silver.\n\nLead transforms into yellow cinnabar,\nLodging in the five metals.\nLead’s exterior is

from it.\nThus it is said: \"The numinous brightness comes of itself.\"\nThis is the five phases moving contrary to their sequence—\nGold being born within water.\n\nAs for lead’s transformation into

silver,\nAnd in the beginning, silver lies within lead—\nLike a child in the mother’s womb.\nNo form to be seen,\nNo boundary to be sought.\nFor example, when smelting silver in an ash pool,\nLead is used to draw it out.\nWhen the fire’s heat intensifies,\nLead sinks and silver emerges.\n\nNow, the silver within Kan\nIs further refined by the crescent moon’s fire,\nThen lead naturally sinks and silver naturally floats.\nThe treasure appears, pure and white,\nAnd when further refined,\nYellow gold can be forged.\n\n---\n\nThe husk is the essence of gold,\nWater encircles the yellow liquid.\nA

subtle tightness,\nThe spirit works within.\nThe furnace and cauldron take their form from this,\nFirmly enclosed, perfectly secure.\n\nThe husk is the essence of gold—\nThe *Cantong Qi* says: \"Use gold as the embankment.\"\nThis gold is that born of the lead mother.\n\"Water encircles the yellow liquid\":\nThe water is that born of Li Palace,\nThe pure water of the Jade Pool.\nThe \"yellow liquid\" is the fluid of the spleen.\n\"A substance the width of an inch\" is the cinnabar field.\nThe Three Powers:\nLi originates from Qian,\nKan originates from Kun,\nThe spleen stands in the

bounds.\nThe lodestone attracts iron,\nThough barriers lie between, they secretly connect.\nHow does the dead hen’s egg,\nWhen matched, give birth?\nGold and earth’s virtue\nAlways accompany mercury.\n\n\"Winding restraint\" is what the *Cantong Qi* calls the \"winding corridor\"—\nThe tail’s closed gate.\nThough the lodestone and iron may be separated by objects,\nThey still secretly connect.\nHow much more so with the furnace and cauldron,\nWhich naturally possess winding restraint,\nMutually controlling and uniting like the hen’s egg’s pairing?\n\nGold is Qian, metal, dwelling above;\nEarth is Kun, soil, dwelling below;\nMercury is humanity, dwelling in the center.\nIn the tenth segment of this scripture,\nGold and fire were called \"lead,\"\nBut in this chapter, only mercury is mentioned.\nGenerally, the fluids of heart and kidneys\nAll emerge as the supreme treasure,\nThus they are collectively termed lead and mercury.\n\n---\n\nThe *Fire Record* was not written
