Author unknown, likely composed between the Tang and Song dynasties. Falsely attributed to the Dao Lord’s teachings on cultivating the body and prolonging life. One scroll.\n\n**Source of Base Text:** *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\nThe Dao Lord speaks:\nI dwell within the Six Directions, abiding in the Hall of Light, guarding and refining essence and spirit. Naturally serene and harmonious, I perceive the four distant realms, all boundaries fully traversed. From the very beginning of creation, I am the primal ancestor of the Dao. I now reveal these causes to speak of your body. You must receive them in secret and not transmit them to others.\n\nHeaven possesses seven mechanisms, and also the Three Luminaries. The Dipper responds to these mechanisms, its light aligning with its *gang*. The Dipper has seven apertures, corresponding to the five viscera. Calm the spirit and nurture tranquility—this is called proper cultivation.\n\nThe ears must not indulge in chaotic hearing; the eyes must not gaze upon evil; the nose must not inhale foulness; the mouth must not partake of杂味. The Three Luminaries, empty within, circulate throughout the entire body. The head is taken as Heaven, the feet as Earth. The Dao’s methods aid humanity—this is the natural *qi*.\n\nIf the ears indulge in chaotic hearing, sounds and sights corrupt the person. If the eyes gaze upon evil, the true light dims. If the nose inhales foulness, the Jade Perfection loses clarity. If the mouth partakes of杂味, the body generates many illnesses. Thus, illness enters through the mouth, and blessings are ruined by sensual indulgence. If you guard against these, your life will endure as long as Heaven.\n\nThose who ingest golden fluid will surely ascend as flying immortals. Those who ingest the returning elixir will strengthen their bones and prolong their years. If you possess the aspiration, dwell only in renowned mountains. Be without action, without desire—abide in stillness and transcend. Do not follow the common folk, whose greed and desires bring enmity. The great Dao and the mysterious sages are before your eyes. The Dipper covers your form, its light illuminating your essence. Practice this in secrecy, and you will attain the Dao’s fulfillment.\n\nHere ends *The Wondrous Scripture on the Three Luminaries Pouring Life-Force, Bestowing Blessings, and Prolonging Lifespan*.",
