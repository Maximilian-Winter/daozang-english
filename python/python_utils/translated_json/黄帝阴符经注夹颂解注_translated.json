  "full_translation": "**Title:**\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing with Interlinear Commentary and Exegesis*\n(*Huangdi Yinfu Jing Jiashong Jiezhu*)\n\n**Author:**\nCompiled by Daoist Wang Jie (style name Daoyuan) of the Yuan-Ming period. Three scrolls.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Tongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing* with Interlinear Commentary and Exegesis**\n\n*\"Heaven follows humanity, humanity follows Heaven\"*—this is the purpose of the *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nIn antiquity, the Yellow Emperor, earnest in his devotion to the Dao, ascended Mount Kongtong to pay homage to Guangchengzi and inquire about the ultimate Way, receiving the secret precepts of returning to eternal life. Later, upon Mount Emei, he again paid homage to Huangren, who imparted the *Wuyaya-Sanyi* scriptures, which he kept secret and cultivated, thereby ascending to the highest immortality. Worried that future generations might lose the true teachings, he composed the *Yinfu Jing* in three sections—upper, middle, and lower—to correspond with the Three Powers (*san cai*), elucidating the marvels of *jing* (essence), *qi*, and *shen* (spirit) in their utmost refinement.\n\nYet fearing that mortals might not grasp the principle of return, he first declared: *\"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s movements, and exhaust them.\"* This is the overarching framework of the three sections of the *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nTo know the Dao of Heaven, one must know the Dao of humanity;\nto know the Dao of humanity, one must know the Dao of the Elixir (*dandao*);\nto know the Dao of the Elixir, one must grasp the mechanics of yin-yang motion and stillness;\nto grasp those mechanics, one must know the principles of internal and external return.\n\nKnowing these principles, one refines lead and mercury without missing the proper moment, and governs the elixir fire without failing to observe its signs. As the text states: *\"Cutting off the single source of profit, the adept’s effort is tenfold; three returns of day and night, the adept’s effort is ten-thousandfold.\"* This further teaches that the essence of cultivating the True lies in maintaining an unshaken resolve to gather and refine the mind and body, and secondarily, in applying unremitting *chou-tian* (withdrawal and addition) techniques without interruption.\n\nThe Way of *Quanzhen* is nothing else:\nFirst, *jing* must be complete;\nSecond, *qi* must be complete;\nThird, *shen* must be complete.\n\nFixing the gaze refines the spirit;\nreturning the hearing refines the essence;\nsealing the speech refines the *qi*.\n\nWhen these three completions and three truths are realized, they naturally merge within, and the True Fire polishes the embryo, forming a golden fetus. After ten months of work, yin is exhausted and yang is pure. At this moment, the fetus is shed, the spirit transforms, and the adept manifests without bounds, transcending birth and death to become an indestructible golden body—this is what is meant by *huan dan* (returning the Elixir).\n\nI say that this text is concise yet profound in meaning. Those who fail to comprehend its teachings may seek explanations externally, straying from the Dao, and thus incur the guilt of presumption and madness. Therefore, I have sequentially explicated each passage of the Master’s secret precepts, supplemented with verse and verification, revealing the hidden mechanisms, awaiting those of like mind. I do not presume to exhaust the subject, but hope this may serve as an aid for beginners.\n\n**The *Yin Fu Jing* Exegesis by Master Róngrán Zǐ Wáng Dàoyuán**\n\n**Preface by Master Róngrán Zǐ Wáng Dàoyuán of Nánchāng’s Xiū River**\n\n*\"Heaven begets, heaven slays—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n*In worldly terms, heaven begets yang, heaven slays yin. One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; one begetting, one slaying—this is principle.*\n\n*Heaven begets in spring, when all things arise from yang—this is Heaven’s *ren* (benevolence).\n*Heaven slays in autumn, when all things withdraw into yin—this is Heaven’s *yì* (righteousness).\n*The waxing and waning of yin and yang—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\n*Thus, the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao, holds principle in mind, and governs the people with *wuwei* (non-action)—this is the Sage’s *ren*.\n*He establishes the Five Punishments to harmonize the laws of the world—this is the Sage’s *yì*.\n*The embodiment and function of *ren* and *yì*—this is the Sage’s Dao.*\n\n*Speaking of Dao’s application: whenever the Winter Solstice arrives within one’s body, one must seal the pass and attain stillness, disperse the mind into fire, refine essence into *qi*, and advance the yang fire upward from the *Tai Xuang Gong* (Supreme Darkness Palace) to the *Nan Gong* (Southern Palace)—this is the principle of Heaven’s begetting.\n*From this point onward, as yang reaches its peak and declines, a single yin arises beneath the five yangs, and one must then gather yang and withdraw the *Yin Fu* (Yin Symbol).\n*Descending from the Jade Mountain to the Upper Capital, then to the Heavy Tower, sending it to the *Kun* position and halting—here, the martial fire is kindled to temper yin into yang—this is the principle of Heaven’s slaying.\n*To circulate this within the body, continuous as if ever-present—is this not the Dao’s principle?\n\n*Master Shao said:*\n*‘When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon Cavern;\nWhen Earth meets Thunder, tread upon the Heavenly Root.’\n*The Heavenly Root and Moon Cavern drift in leisure—\nThirty-six palaces are all spring.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*‘The yang dragon and yin tiger coil in rotation,\nHeaven’s hidden mechanisms of life and death unfold naturally.\nRefined, the true seed of One-Nine emerges,\nWithin the vessel, spring overflows—Dao eternal.’*\n\n---\n\n**Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nAll things are thieves of humanity;\nHumanity is the thief of all things.**\n\n*Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things*—this means Heaven and Earth generate all things, and the life and form of all things are formed by the interplay of yin and yang’s transformation. At every thought and impulse, Heaven and Earth know.\n*Those who do good are protected by ghosts and spirits;\nThose who do evil are struck by thunder and punishment*—this is how Heaven and Earth govern all things.\n\n*All things are thieves of humanity*—this means all things arise alongside humanity, and within the human body dwell eighty-four thousand worms. Briefly stated: internally, the five viscera are consumed by *qí* and *huí* worms; externally, the skin is attacked by lice and fleas. As *Tan Jing Sheng*’s *Book of Transformation* says:\n*‘The worms that camp within the belly\nPlunder my vital *qi*, melt my spirit-soul,\nSteal my flavors, yet live by them.’*\nThis is how all things steal from humanity.\n\n*Humanity is the thief of all things*—this means humanity is the most refined of all things, encompassing within one mind the principles of all things. It learns from Heaven and Earth to know transformation, from spiders to weave nets, from bees to establish hierarchy, from moles to institute rites, from phoenixes to compose music, from ants to arrange armies. The Sage can take the principles of all things and perfect them within the self—this is how humanity steals from all things.\n\n*In summary, the generation of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all lies within the Great Transformation. Forms steal from forms, things deceive things—none of this is outside the influence of yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*. Only the Daoist, who comprehends the Three Thefts and transcends yin and yang, is free from the Three Corpses’ plunder.*\n\n*Students should ponder this deeply.*\n\n*Ode:*\n*Heaven, Earth, and humanity share in all things’ birth,\nEach family, each orifice holds its own spirit.\nForms steal from forms through yin and yang’s transformation—\nThe enlightened transcend the mundane, entering the Supreme Clarity.\nThe Three Thefts are resolved, the Three Powers are at peace.*\n\n*This follows the earlier discussion of the Three Thefts, thus it says:*\n*The Three Thefts resolved, the Three Powers secure*—this refers to the enlightened one, whose single nature illuminates all principles, who can discern that the body’s four elements are but yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*, artificially combined. Unbound by form, one secretly practices the Symbol Fire to refine form and spirit. When spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies, this is the Golden Elixir’s great medicine, capable of slaying the Three Corpses’ worms. Once the Three Thefts are extinguished, the Three Powers naturally settle.\n\n*As Master Shao said:*\n*‘Having known all things are within me,\nWhy would I separately establish the Three Powers?’*\n\n*Zhang Zǐyáng said:*\n*‘Pursue the Two *Qi* along the Yellow Path,\nUnite the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace.\nWhen spirit is whole, there is no need for sleep;\nWhen *qi* is whole, there is no need for food;\nWhen essence is whole, there is no need for desire.\nWhen practice reaches this point, how could the Three Powers be unstable?’*\n\n*Ode:*\n*The Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within the body,\nThe Heart-Sovereign turns all things, each returning to root.\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s positions are fixed, demons are subdued,\nThe myriad lands enjoy peace under the Sage’s grace.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize.\nStir the mechanism, and all transformations settle.’*\n\n*This further elaborates on the Three Powers being secure, thus it says:*\n*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize’*—this means the practitioner must daily regulate the five viscera, ensuring meals are taken at their proper times. If no time is lost, then the three hundred sixty bones and blood-*qi* flow unimpeded throughout the body, with no place unnourished, and illness cannot arise. Having secured bodily health, one can then nurture spirit and embrace *qi*, dwelling eternally in the Central Field, drawing from the *Hua Chi* (Flower Pond) and *Yu Ye* (Jade Liquid) to irrigate the sacred root—its shoots will naturally flourish.\n*As Laozi said:*\n*‘When the Dao prevails in the world, even warhorses are used for manure—\nI alone differ from others, valuing the Mother’s nourishment.’*\n\n*‘Stir the mechanism, and all transformations settle’*—this means when the first yang stirs, one must immediately turn the Dipper’s handle to respond to it. Each practice of the Dao will make the myriad spirits within the body feel at ease.*\"\n\n「The Pure Yang True Person’s *Alchemical Poems* state:\n*Within the vast Dao of Heaven and Earth, alone I dwell,\nFrom head to toe, each step refines the Primordial Essence’s work.\nWith nimble skill, I wield the Dipper’s Cross,\nBoldly overturning the Southern Star’s mechanism—my *qi* as fierce as steel.*\n\n*When the myriad spirits wail and demons lament, the golden cauldron cracks,\nAs roosters take flight and dogs dissolve, the jade furnace stands empty.*\n\n*How can the common man seek such ordinary ways?\nThe Dao’s subtleties are boundless—its mysteries fathomless.*\n\n*The *Alchemical Canon* says:\n*‘Deliberate well—this is wondrous indeed!\nEach dawn, I urge the *Zi Xia* [Purple Cloud] Cup to rise.’*\n\n*If one binds the Earthly *Po* [embryo/soul] with precision,\nThe Heavenly *Hun* [ethereal soul] will naturally come to bless longevity.*\n\n*Thus it is said.*\n\n*Praise:\n*To cultivate the True, one must balance food and breath.\nA single *qi* harmonizes the Five Organs, cleansing them all.\nThe Golden Elixir refines the form, the Divine Fire tempers the spirit—\nEvery pore in the body radiates brilliance.*\n\n*Men know the spirit’s spirit,\nBut fail to grasp the source of the non-spirit’s spirit.*\n\n*The spirit, for its name, is *Ling* [numinous],\nAnd *Xing* [inherent nature].*\n\n*Before the parents were born, its beginning was not known;\nAfter the parents were born, its end was not seen.*\n\n*Most numinous, most sacred,\nMost profound, most subtle—\nIt encompasses all forms,\nIt encompasses all spirits,\nUnborn, unending,\nNeither square nor round.*\n\n*Thus the Pure and True True Person said:\n*‘This spirit is not the spirit of deliberation,\nBut one that stands equal with the Primordial Origin.’*\n\n*This passage speaks of how the student’s daily cultivation must first focus on clarifying inherent nature.\nWithin the heart-mind, one must always maintain purity and stillness,\nNever allowing even a thread of private desire to obstruct it,\nNor clinging to forms while seeking the mysterious.*\n\n*If one merely conjures an intention,\nThe spirit ceases to be spirit.*\n\n*The *Sutra* says:\n*‘The human spirit loves clarity, yet the heart disturbs it—\nThe spirit’s full brilliance lies in the heart’s emptiness, profound silence, and containing the True.\nIt shares its essence with the Great Void,\nIts luminosity with the sun and moon.’*\n\n*In all interactions with affairs and beings,\nOne must let inherent nature respond spontaneously,\nTurning with the natural flow—\nThus the Three Realms are traversed in harmony,\nAnd this is why one does not know the non-spirit’s source of spirit.*\n\n*The True Person said:\n*‘It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds.’*\n\n*The *Diamond Sutra* declares:\n*‘If one seeks the Tathāgata through form and appearance,\nOr through sound and voice,\nThey tread the wrong path and cannot see the Buddha.’*\n\n*These words are complete.*\n\n*Praise:\n*A single point of Primordial Spirit is the ultimate numinous.\nWhen the spirit knows itself, it is no longer true.\nIf one awakens to the spirit’s empty essence,\nThe resplendent void shines without a trace of cloud.*\n\n*The sun and moon have their cycles,\nThe small and great have their limits.\nFrom here arise the sacred works,\nFrom here emerge the divine luminosities.*\n\n*This follows the previous explanation of clarifying inherent nature,\nAnd now reveals the method of cultivating life.*\n\n*Having secured the dwelling of inherent nature,\nOne must then attend to the life-gate.*\n\n*If one can cultivate both inherent nature and life,\nOnly then does the form and spirit attain perfect harmony.*\n\n*The method of cultivating life is such:\nThe student may observe the Dao of Heaven,\nWhere the sun and moon revolve, marking the Winter and Summer Solstices,\nAnd the Yin-Yang equilibrium at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes.\nDays accumulate into months,\nMonths accumulate into years—\nThus the sun and moon have their cycles,\nAnd the small and great have their limits.*\n\n*Has it not been heard?\nThe sun belongs to Yang, the moon to Yin;\nThe moon itself has no light, but borrows the sun’s.*\n\n*At the month’s dark and new phases,\nThe Great Yin and Great Yang meet in the same palace,\nAnd the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;\nFrom the second to the third day, the moon gradually departs from the sun,\nAnd the sun’s light shines upon it, generating a small brilliance—\nThe *Hun* grows, the *Po* diminishes.*\n\n*By the eighth day, night and day share equal light—\nThis is called the Upper Crescent.*\n*From here onward, until the fifteenth day at night,\nThe moon faces the sun, its light full and great—\nAt this point, the *Hun* reaches its peak, and the *Po* emerges.*\n\n*From the sixteenth to the seventeenth days onward,\nThe *Po* grows, the *Hun* fades,\nAnd the moon’s light gradually wanes.*\n\n*By the twenty-third day at night,\nThe light is equally divided below—\nThis is called the Lower Crescent.*\n*From here, until the thirtieth day at night,\nThe moon’s light fades completely, returning once more to darkness.*\n\n*Thus it cycles endlessly, without end—\nA natural and effortless movement of Heaven’s Dao.*\n*Therefore, the great cultivator applies this principle within his own body,\nAnd refines the *Fire Elucidation* [周天火候] of the Heavenly Cycle.*\n\n*The sun and moon spoken of here are the spirit and *qi*,\nWater and Fire,\nLead and Mercury,\nAnd inherent nature and emotions.*\n\n*When making the elixir,\nOne must merge spirit with *qi*,\nConsolidating its foundation within,\nAnd letting the spirit soar forth in the *Yin* [Tiger] Hour.\nBy the *Shen* [Monkey] Hour, one must increase the fire,\nAs the sun’s light shines upon the moon—\nGradually, the brilliance grows and strengthens.*\n\n*The essence transforms into *qi*,\nDirectly entering the *Cinnabar Field* [泥丸],\nAs the moon faces the sun—\nFollowing this, Yin emerges,\nAnd according to the *Green Maiden Transmission* [《青女传》],\nThe elixir is withdrawn into the Earthly Palace,\nWhere the sun and moon join as one—\nThe elixir begins to form, small at first,\nBut with deep cultivation, it grows great—\nThus it is said: ‘The sun and moon have their cycles,\nAnd the small and great have their limits.’*\n\n*Diligently gather, diligently refine,\nTimely cook and temper—\nThe True Embryo flourishes,\nWisdom and insight open wide—\nThus it is said: ‘From here arise the sacred works,\nFrom here emerge the divine luminosities.’*\n\n*Praise:\n*The sun and moon cycle endlessly, their work applied—\nThe elixir’s essence is born from the *Dharma-qi* [梵气].*\n*From the subtle to the manifest, the spirit transcends the sacred,\nAnd within the fire, lotuses bloom one by one.*\n\n*As for stealing the mechanism,\nNo one in the world can see or know it.*\n*The noble man attains it and secures his body,\nThe petty man gains it and risks his life.*\n\n*This follows the previous explanation of refining the sun and moon within one’s body,\nAnd thus attaining the sacred works and divine luminosities—\nHence it is said:*\n\n*‘The stealing here refers not to the worldly thievery of common men,\nBut to the method of refining the Heavenly Cycle’s elixir-fire—\nIn a single breath’s time, one can surpass a year’s transformation of Heaven and Earth.’*\n\n*The *Alchemical Canon* says:\n*‘When the Five Phases flow in order,\nA tiger emerges from water;\nWhen the Five Phases are inverted,\nA dragon arises from fire.’*\n\n*Those who practice this Dao\nCannot be confined by Heaven and Earth,\nNor bound by the *Bazi* [六十甲子, sixty-year Heavenly Stem-Earthly Branch cycle].*\n*Thus, the great cultivator is a thief beyond Heaven and Earth.’*\n\nZhang Wǔyáng said:\n\n*\"The practice is easy, but the medicine is not distant—\nIs this not the very essence of the ‘thief’s method’?*\n\nThis ‘thief’s method’ is supremely simple, yet supremely subtle—\nIt is the form without form, the image without image.\nThus, none under Heaven can see it, none can know it.\n\nThe noble one who attains it\nIs humble, retiring, and unassuming,\nNurtures simplicity and preserves authenticity;\nDiscards sharp intellect, relying solely on virtue as his body;\nDiminishes further, blending with the mundane and dust;\nResponds naturally to all that comes, without joy or anger.\nHe never flaunts his Dao—\nThis is how he holds it close to his essence.\n\nAs *Laozi* says:\n*'I have three treasures, guarding and preserving them:\nFirst, compassion;\nSecond, frugality;\nThird, not daring to lead the world.'*\nAnd again:\n*'The highest virtue is without virtue—\nThus, it is truly virtuous.'*\n\nThe petty one, if he attains this Dao,\nWill instead flaunt it, unable to conceal himself.\nHe grows arrogant, self-aggrandizing,\nBoasting and vainglorious,\nDeceiving others and scornful of the Way,\nCompletely without restraint,\nWith shallow virtue and shallow conduct—\nAll despise him.\n\nSuch a man has never failed to court harm\nAnd risk his life—\nLike Páng Juān’s kind.\n\nThe *Classical Text* says:\n*'Those who praise themselves are blind,\nThose who insist on being right are unilluminated,\nThose who boast of their achievements gain no merit,\nThose who brag of their virtue do not endure,\nThe overbearing meet no natural end.'*\n\nConfucius thus said:\n*'The petty one reverses the Mean—\nThe petty one has no restraint.'*\n\nIs this not true speech?\nThe student should carefully examine this.\n\n「The *Preface* states:\nThe *Burning Mountain* [1] seals the Dao of Heaven’s theft,\nThe *Great Symbol* [2] hides the subtle mysteries of the Way.\nThe virtuous one attains it and retreats to preserve himself,\nWhile the petty one, once he gains it, acts recklessly.\n\n*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4] therein concludes:\n*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4]—[5] *Master Rúndàoyuān* of *Nánchāng Xiūjiāng* [6] annotates:\nHeaven’s birth and Heaven’s death are the Way’s principle.\nSpeaking in terms of worldly law,\nHeaven’s birth is *yang* [7], Heaven’s death is *yin* [8];\nOne *yin* and one *yang* is called the Way,\nOne birth and one death is called principle.\n\nHeaven’s birth occurs in spring,\nWhen all things arise from *yang*—Heaven’s benevolence;\nHeaven’s death occurs in autumn,\nWhen all things withdraw into *yin*—Heaven’s righteousness.\nThe ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang* are the Way’s principle.\n\nThus, the sage observes Heaven’s Way,\nHolds principle within his heart,\nAnd transforms the people of the world through non-action—this is the sage’s benevolence;\nWith the five punishments [9], he harmonizes the laws of the world—this is the sage’s righteousness.\nBenevolence and righteousness in essence and application are the sage’s Way.\n\nSpeaking in terms of application,\nWhen one encounters the winter solstice [10] within his body,\nHe must close the gate [11] and remain still,\nSending his mind aloft to transform fire,\nRefining essence into *qi*,\nAdvancing the *yang* fire,\nFrom the *Tàixuān Palace* [12] drawing upward to the *Nán Palace* [13]—this is Heaven’s birth principle.\n\nOnce this is done, the *yang* reaches its peak and declines,\nSo when one *yin* arises beneath the five *yang*,\nHe must withdraw the *yang* and suppress the *Obscure Precept* of *yin*.\nFrom *Yùshān* [14] descending to *Chónglóu* [15],\nConveying it to the *Kūn* [16] position and halting,\nIgniting the *Martial Fire* [17] to temper and refine,\nCooking *yin* into *yang*—this is Heaven’s death principle.\n\nCultivating within one’s body,\nContinuously as if sustained—\nIs this not the Way’s principle?\n\n*Master Shào* [18] says:\nWhen *Qián* [19] meets *Xùn* [20], observe the *Moon Cavern* [21];\nWhen earth encounters *léi* [22], tread upon Heaven’s root.\nHeaven’s root and Moon Cavern come and go at leisure,\nThirty-six palaces [23] are all spring.\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nThe *yang* dragon and *yin* tiger intertwine in circles,\nHeaven’s birth and death principles unfold naturally.\nRefining yields the *One Nine* [24] true seed,\nA caldron full of spring—Dao stretches endlessly.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nAll things are thieves of man;\nMan is the thief of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things—\nThis means Heaven and Earth generate all things,\nAnd the vitality of all things,\nNone escape the *yin-yang* transformations that form their bodies.\nEvery thought and intention—Heaven and Earth know them all.\nDoing good brings protection from spirits and gods;\nDoing evil invites punishment by thunder and lightning—\nThis is how Heaven and Earth treat all things.\n\nAll things are thieves of man—\nThis means all things arise alongside man,\nAnd within the human body, eight thousand four hundred insects [25] thrive.\nSpeaking briefly,\nInternally, the five viscera [26] are consumed by *wēngzhì* [27] worms,\nExternally, the skin is attacked by fleas and lice.\nAs *Tán Jǐngshēng*’s *Book of Transformation* [28] says:\n*Wēngzhì* [29] insects, the worms of the belly,\nStruggle with my *qi* and essence,\nMelt my spirit and soul,\nSteal my nourishment,\nAnd yet sustain their own lives.\nThis is how all things steal from man.\n\nMan is the thief of all things—\nThis means man is the most refined of all things,\nOne mind encompassing the principles of all things,\nLearning from Heaven and Earth to know transformations,\nLearning from the *spider* to weave nets,\nLearning from the *bee* to establish hierarchy,\nLearning from the *gopher* to create rituals,\nLearning from the *phoenix* to compose music,\nLearning from the *ant* to arrange armies and formations.\nThe sage can extract the principles of all things to perfect himself—\nThis is how man steals from all things.\n\nIn summary,\nThe birth of Heaven, Earth, and man,\nAll lie within the Great Transformation [30],\nEach form stealing from another,\nEach thing deceiving another,\nNone but the *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* [31] acting thus.\nOnly the Daoist who understands the Three Thefts [32],\nTranscending beyond *yin-yang*,\nWill escape the harm of the Three Corpses [33] stealing from him.\nThe student should ponder this well.\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nHeaven, Earth, and man share the birth of all things,\nEach family and orifice holds its own spirit.\nForms steal from forms through *yin-yang* transformations,\nThe enlightened transcend the mundane to enter *Tàiqīng* [34].\nThe Three Thefts [35] being understood,\nThe Three Powers [36] are at peace.\nThis follows the previous discourse on the Three Thefts,\nTherefore it says:\nWhen the Three Thefts are understood,\nThe Three Powers are at peace—\nThis refers to the Daoist,\nWhose singular nature is awakened and illuminated,\nWhose myriad principles are unified,\nWho can discern that the body’s Four Great Elements [37]\nAre but *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* falsely combined.\nHe is not bound by form,\nBut secretly practices the *Obscure Precept* fire\nTo refine body and spirit.\nWhen spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies,\nThis is called the *Great Elixir* [38],\nA medicine capable of annihilating the Three Corpses [33].\nOnce the Three Thefts are extinguished,\nThe Three Powers naturally rest.\n\nAs *Master Shào* says:\nWhen one knows all things are complete within me,\nWhy would he separately establish the Three Powers?\n\n*Zhāng Zǐyáng* [39] thus said:\n*\"Chasing the Two Qì [40] along the Yellow Dao [41],\nUniting the Three Natures [42] in the Primordial Palace [43],\nThe spirit is whole and does not crave sleep,\nThe *qi* is whole and does not crave food,\nThe essence is whole and does not crave desire—\nWhen cultivation reaches this point,\nWhat fear is there that the Three Powers will not be at peace?\"*\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nThe Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within one’s body,\nThe heart—*sovereign*—[44] turns and governs all things, each returning to its root.\n*Qián* and *Kūn* [45] secure their positions, demons and evils are subdued,\nThe myriad lands are in harmony, bearing the sage’s grace.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony.\nStir the mechanisms of the body, and all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\nThis again follows the previous discourse on the Three Powers being at peace,\nTherefore it says:\n*\"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony\"*—\nThis means the student’s daily essentials:\nRegulating the five viscera,\nEating and drinking must not be untimed.\nIf he does not lose the proper timing,\nThen the three hundred sixty bones and joints,\nBlood and *qi* flow unrestricted throughout the body,\nNo place remains blocked,\nAnd ailments will not arise.\nWith his body now healthy and at ease,\nHe can nurture his spirit and embrace his *qi*,\nDwelling in the *Central Field* [46],\nTaking *Huápú* [47] and *Yùyè* [48] elixirs seasonally\nTo irrigate the *Root of the Mysterious* [49],\nAnd its shoots will flourish.\n\nThus *Laozi* [50] said:\n*\"When the world has the Dao,\nEven warhorses are turned back to plow fields.\nI alone differ from others,\nValuing the *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things* [51].\"*\n\nThe stirring of its mechanism, all transformations finding peace—\nThis means when the first *Yáng* [52] stirs, one must immediately turn the *Dòugǎng* [53] mechanism to respond,\nFor each practice of the *Dao* brings vitality to all ten thousand spirits within the body.\n\nThe *Pure Yang True Person*’s *Gold Elixir Poetry* states:\n*\"Alone within the vast *Kàn* and *Kūn* [54] forms,*\n*From the crown, meticulously refining the Primordial Function.*\n*Wielding the *Beidou*’s [55] cunning heart-mechanism,*\n*Inverting the *Nánchén* [56] with heroic resolve.*\n*Ghosts wail, gods lament as the Golden Cauldron cracks,*\n*Roosters take flight, dogs transmute—*\n*The Jade Furnace stands empty.*\n*How can the vulgar seeker grasp this commonplace?*\n*The *Dao*’s profundity is boundless, its mysteries unfathomable.\"*\n\nThe *Alchemical Classic* says:\n*\"Carefully ponder this marvel—*\n*Each dawn, urging the *Zǐxīa* [57] cup to its depths.*\n*If you seize the *Earth’s Soul* [58] with precision,*\n*Then the *Heavenly Spirit* [59] will naturally bestow longevity.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n\n*Ode:*\n*\"Cultivation’s diet must be balanced and regulated,*\n*The *Qi* harmonized, the five viscera cleansed.*\n*The Golden Elixir refines form, the *Shénhuǒ* [60] tempers essence,*\n*Every pore in the body radiates luminous clarity.\"*\n\nMen know the *shén* of *shén* [61],\nBut do not know the *non-shén* of *shén*’s essence.\nFor *shén*—this word for *ling* [62], for *xìng* [63]—\nIs the human’s luminous, formless nature.\nBefore parents conceived, it had no beginning;\nAfter birth, it has no end.\nMost subtle, most sacred,\nMost profound, most refined,\nIt encompasses all forms,\nEmbraces all spirits,\nNeither born nor destroyed,\nNeither square nor round.\n\nThe *White-Purple Pure True Person* thus declared:\n*\"This *shén* is not the *shén* of deliberation,*\n*But stands equal to *Yuānshǐ* [64] himself.\"*\n\nThis section speaks of the student’s daily cultivation—\nFirst, one must clarify the nature,\nKeeping the heart-mind ever serene,\nFree of even a thread of private desire.\nNor should one cling to forms while seeking the mysterious.\nIf but a thought arises,\nThe *shén* is no longer *shén*.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The human *shén* loves clarity, yet the mind disturbs it.\nThe marvel of the *shén*’s entirety lies in the heart’s emptiness—\nSilent, containing truth,\nIn harmony with the *Tàixū* [65],\nAs luminous as the sun and moon.\"*\n\nIn all interactions and encounters,\nOne’s nature responds spontaneously,\nTurning with the *Three Realms* [66] in perfect unity—\nThus the saying: *\"One does not know the *non-shén* of *shén*.\"*\n\nThe *True Person Zhang* said:\n*\"It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds.\"*\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* states:\n*\"Worldly beings seek me through form and sound—\nThese are the paths of delusion,\nAnd they cannot see the *Thus-Come One*.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n\n*Ode:*\n*\"A single point of Primordial Spirit is the utmost *shén*,\nYet when the *shén* knows its dwelling, it is no longer true.\nIf one awakens to the *shén*’s empty essence,\nThe boundless true void shines without obstruction.\"*\n\nThe sun and moon follow their cycles,\nSmall and great have their fixed measures.\nFrom this, the sacred function arises,\nAnd the divine luminosity emerges.\n\nThis follows the earlier discussion of clarifying the nature’s essence,\nAnd thus expounds the method of nurturing life.\nHaving settled the nature,\nOne must then address the *mìng* [67].\nIf both nature and life are cultivated together,\nOnly then will form and *shén* both attain perfection.\n\nThe secret of nurturing life:\nThe student may observe the *Dao* of Heaven—\nThe sun and moon revolve, marking the *Winter* and *Summer Solstices*,\n*Yīn* and *Yáng* pause at the *Mao-Yǒu Divisions* [68],\nDays accumulate into months, months into years—\nThus the sun and moon have their numbers,\nSmall and great their fixed measures.\n\nHas it not been said:\n*The sun belongs to *Yáng*, the moon to *Yīn*,\nThe moon itself has no light, borrowing the sun’s radiance.*\nAt the *new moon* and *full moon*,\nThe *Great Yin* and *Great Yang* meet in the same palace,\nAnd the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;\nFrom the second and third days onward,\nThe moon drifts farther from the sun,\nAnd the sun’s light strikes it—\nIts brilliance grows, yet it remains small,\nThe *hún* [69] lengthens while the *pò* [70] diminishes;\nBy the eighth day’s night,\nIts light is half-illuminated above—\nThis is called the *Upper Crescent*;\nFrom this point onward, until the fifteenth night,\nThe moon faces the sun, its light full and vast—\nAt this juncture, the *hún* reaches its peak while the *pò* arises;\nOn the sixteenth and seventeenth days,\nThe *pò* grows while the *hún* wanes,\nAnd the moon’s light gradually diminishes;\nBy the twenty-third night,\nIts light is half-illuminated below—\nThis is called the *Lower Crescent*;\nFrom this retreat until the thirtieth night,\nThe moon’s light fades entirely, returning to darkness once more.\nThis cycle repeats endlessly, without end—\nA natural unfolding of Heaven’s transformations.\nThus, the great practitioner embodies this principle within oneself,\nCirculating the *Zhōutiān* [71] fire and timing within the body.\n\nThe *sun* and *moon* refer to:\n*Shén* and *qì*, water and fire, lead and mercury, nature and emotion.\nWhen refining the elixir,\nOne merges *shén* with *qì*,\nConsolidating within—\nThe *shén* flies forth to the *Yín* direction,\nBy *Shēn* hour, the fire advances,\nAs the sun’s light strikes the moon,\nIts brilliance grows and strengthens;\nThe *jīng* [72] flows, transforming into *qì*,\nStraight into the *Níhuán* [73],\nAs the moon faces the sun—\nFollowing this, *Yīn* arises,\nUsing the *Qīngnǚ* [74]’s words,\nThe *Fù* symbol retreats downward into the *Kūn* palace,\nThe sun and moon unite in harmony,\nForming the *Returning Elixir*—\nAt first, the elixir is small,\nBut with deepened practice, it grows vast—\nThus it is said: *\"The sun and moon have their numbers,\nSmall and great their fixed measures.\"*\n\nDiligently gather, diligently refine,\nTimely cooking and tempering—\nThe true embryo flourishes,\nWisdom opens fully—\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sacred function arises,\nAnd the divine luminosity emerges.\"*\n\n*Ode:*\n*\"The sun and moon revolve in their celestial cycles,*\n*The *Dàfàn* [75] *qi* refines the sacred embryo.*\n*From the subtle to the manifest, the *shén* transcends the sacred,*\n*Lotus blossoms unfold within the fire.\"*\n\nIts mechanism is stolen—\nNone in the world can see it,\nNone can know it.\nThe virtuous man who attains it guards it within himself,\nWhile the petty man who grasps it risks his life.\n\nThis follows the discussion of circulating the sun and moon within the body,\nThus the sacred function arises and the divine luminosity emerges—\nHence it is said:\n*\"Its mechanism is stolen\"*—\nThis *thief* is not the common thief of the world,\nBut the method of circulating the *Zhōutiān* fire-symbols.\nA single breath’s work can surpass Heaven and Earth’s year-long transformations.\n\nThe *Alchemical Classic* says:\n*\"The Five Phases move in order,\nAnd the tiger emerges from the water.\"*\n\nThe Five Phases inverted—\nThe dragon emerges from the fire.\n\nPractitioners of this Dao/Way\nCannot be confined by Heaven and Earth,\nNor restrained by the *jiǎzǐ* cycle.\nHence, the great adept becomes\nA thief beyond the bounds of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAs Zhang Ziyang said:\n*\"The practice is easy, the medicine is not far away—\nIs this not the stolen mechanism?\"*\n\nThis stolen mechanism is supremely simple and easy,\nThe state of the formless form,\nThe symbol of the shapeless symbol—\nThus none in the world can see it,\nNone can know it.\n\nThe virtuous man who attains it\nIs humble, modest, and withdraws,\nHolding fast to purity and preserving truth;\nAbandoning sharp intellect, discarding cleverness,\nHe alone lets *virtue/power* be his body;\nDiminishing further, diminishing yet again,\nMerging with the common, blending with the dust;\nResponding to what comes, without joy or anger.\nHe never openly proclaims his attainment of the Dao/Way—\nThis is why he who possesses it guards it within himself.\n\nThe *Laozi* says:\n*\"I have three treasures,\nPreserve and uphold them:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to act before all under Heaven.\"*\n\nAnd again:\n*\"The highest virtue/power is without virtue/power—\nThus it is said: 'He who has virtue/power is truly virtuous/powerful.'\"*\n\nThe petty man, if he grasps this Dao/Way,\nWill surely flaunt it,\nUnable to conceal himself—\nSelf-aggrandizing, self-proclaiming,\nSelf-praising, self-boasting,\nCheating others and defying the *dharma*,\nCompletely without restraint,\nShallow in virtue/power and shallow in practice—\nAll men despise him.\nSuch a man has never failed\nTo fall into harm and risk his life,\nLike Páng Juān of old.\n\nThe scripture says:\n*\"Those who see themselves are not enlightened,\nThose who insist on their own ways are not renowned,\nThose who praise themselves achieve no merit,\nThose who boast of themselves do not endure,\nThe overbearing meet no peaceful death.\"*\n\nThus Confucius said:\n*\"The petty man inverts the *zhōngyōng*,\nThe petty man is without restraint.\"*\nIs this not true?\n\nThe student should carefully examine this.\n\n「Preceding verse states:\nThe *fúzi* burns mountains to steal the heavens’ secrets,\nThe Great Symbol vanishes—its Dao/Way is subtle and profound.\nThe virtuous man, attaining it, retreats to guard his self,\nThe petty man, once gaining it, acts recklessly.\n\n**Huángdì’s *Yīnxíng Jīng* (夹颂解注) in its upper and lower volumes**\n**The *Rúndào Yuān* (王道渊) of Nánchāng’s *Xiūjiāng* (修江) explains thus:**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.\nCut off the source of profit, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher tenfold;\nThreefold return through day and night, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher ten thousandfold.\n\nThe blind—those without eyes—\nThe deaf—those who cannot hear.\nIn worldly terms, though a man has two eyes, he may still be blind,\nAnd though his two ears are deaf, his sight may yet be keen.\n\nThis illustrates how ordinary men, driven by insatiable desires,\nFollow the openings where their passions leak,\nPursue the external while neglecting the internal—\nThus, the common man clings to worldly affairs,\nAnd so this metaphor is offered as a warning to the student.\n\nYet speaking of the Dao/Way,\nA great adept’s perfect wisdom flows unimpeded,\nHis divine responses are effortless—\nHis eyes hear, his ears see.\nAh! The marvel of sight and hearing lies not in eyes and ears,\nBut in the divine responses of mind and spirit.\n\nCutting off the source of profit yields tenfold skill over a teacher,\nFor this refers to the cultivation of one’s true nature,\nExtinguishing all desires for gain,\nCleansing the heart to its pure source—\nThus, one attains clarity of spirit,\nYet still cannot match the labor of martial practice.\nHence, it is said that one’s skill is tenfold that of a teacher,\nMerely as a figure to describe the effort of cultivating nature.\n\nEven if one achieves stillness like the void,\nIt remains but the work of the shadow-spirit (*yīnshén*).\nHow much more wondrous is the threefold return of day and night,\nWith its power to restore yang, transmute bones!\n\nOf the threefold return, there are two explanations:\nThe external threefold return refers to the eyes, ears, and mouth,\nThe internal threefold return refers to essence, *qi*, and spirit.\n\nWithin the twenty-four hours,\nExternally, one must return the light of the eyes,\nConcentrate the resonance of the ears,\nSeal the breath of the mouth—\nDay and night, reflecting inward without pause,\nNot for a moment to be interrupted.\nInternally, one must merge the three treasures (*sān bǎo*) into unity,\nNever missing the heavens’ divine opportunities.\nWhen the time arrives for the birth of *yǐn* (癸) from *yīn* (铅),\nOne must suspend the *sùzhū* (黍珠) within the boundless void,\nClutching it firmly without motion,\nAs the spirit soars and sinks to the depths of the sea,\nRefining essence into *qi*,\nDriving it upward to the Southern Palace (*Nángōng*),\nSupplementing *lí* (离) to become *qián* (乾).\nContinuing thus, one refines *qi* into spirit,\nDescending directly to the Yellow Court (*Huángtíng*) and halting.\nThe *xùn* (巽) gate opens in pairs,\nThe great fire warms and refines—\nWithin the space of a meal,\nThe spirit is refined and returns to the void.\n\nThe void resounds with clarity,\nRestoring the original nature—\nThis is the Dao/Way of dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nThe *Dùrén Jīng* (度人经) states:\n*\"Harmonize the five *qì* (气) in their midst,\nBlend the hundred spirits into unity,\nTen revolutions restore the soul’s essence,\nTen thousand breaths align with the immortals.\"*\n\nThe *Dān Jīng* (丹经) says:\n*\"Do not carve time into divisions of *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午),\nNor fix the *yáo* (爻) and *guà* (卦) to determine *qián* (乾) and *kūn* (坤).\"*\n\nThus, when one practices the Dao/Way once,\nThe myriad heavens resound in distant hymns,\nThe ten thousand lords arrange their rites.\nThe cultivation of the elixir (*dān*)—\nIts merit is boundless.\n\nThreefold return through day and night—\nIs this not ten thousandfold skill over a teacher?\n\n**Preceding verse states:**\nThe blind hear, the deaf see—wondrous mind unites.\nCutting off profit, the heart’s source clears, tenfold the skill.\nThe great medicine’s threefold return through day and night,\nDivine transformations endless—Dao/Way knows no bounds.\n\nMind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.\nIn worldly terms, the common man’s mind is enslaved by form,\nHis day filled with chaotic deeds and recognition,\nHis mind never free from things.\nMind arises from things—it dies by things—\nIts divine responses lie in the two eyes.\n\nWhen any object appears before the eyes,\nLove and attachment stir the mind,\nThe thoughts and perceptions chase outward,\nDay by day, month by month, they grow—\nPlanting the seeds of death below,\nAll trace back to the eyes’ leakage.\n\n*The Lǎozǐ* says:\n*\"Man’s birth is his movement toward death.\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life.\"*\n\nThe mind is hard to subdue\nBecause its divine responses lie in the eyes.\n\nYet speaking of the Dao/Way,\nA great adept steadies his mind, clears his stillness,\nTaking the Dao/Way as his very self.\nWhenever the mind arises from things,\nHe summons the six transcendent powers (*liùtōng*),\nEmits vast golden light,\nIlluminating the boundless world,\nDeploying the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole to restore it—\nThus, things die while the Dao/Way flourishes,\nIts divine responses rooted in the heavens’ eyes,\nThe flowing, absorbing, and revolving of intent.\n\nThis must be transmitted orally—\nI dare not reveal it openly.\n\nThe *Chuān Lǎo* (川老) annotates *The Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* (金刚经):\n*\"The Vajra treads upon the earth,\nThe flagpole points to the heavens.\nTo know the true foundation,\nLook to the Northern Dipper facing south.\"*\n\n**Preceding verse states:**\nMind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.\nTen revolutions restore the soul’s essence,\nReturning to the marvelous orifices—\nThe spirit condenses, the *qi* settles, and the Dao/Way flourishes.\n\nThe heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nNone fail to tremble in awe.\n\nThe heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises,\nFor the heavens take the birth of all things as their heart,\nThe four seasons’ transformations as natural law—\nHow could they intend to bestow kindness?\n\nIt is because all things arise,\nThat demons and evil forces act in turn,\nTheir rebellion harming the upright—\nThus, the heavens’ great kindness is compelled.\n\nHence, they use thunder to proclaim their edicts,\nAnd unleash fierce winds to display their might,\nSo that all things submit and return to the right.\nThose demons and evil forces that refuse to mend their ways,\nThunder obliterates their forms,\nThe wind’s blades shatter their bodies—\nRemoving one harm to ensure the peace of all.\n\nThe heavens’ awe is manifest—\nHow could they tolerate their transgressions?\n\nThis is how the heavens, though without deliberate kindness,\nYet great kindness arises,\nAnd when great kindness arises,\nSwift thunder and fierce winds tremble in awe,\nTheir divine marvels roused and inspired—\nIn an instant, they fill the void,\nTheir transformations beyond measure.\n\nThe Sage also embodies the Dao/Way and acts accordingly,\nTo bring peace to the people of the world.\nWhen the people are pure and joyful in their transformations,\nNo kindness need be bestowed—\nYet if some rebel and harm the people,\nThe Sage must establish lords and marshal armies,\nDeploying armor and weapons to strike them down,\nRemoving one tyrant to ensure the welfare of the good.\n\nIt is like swift thunder and fierce winds,\nShaking their awe and might,\nShowing the stubborn their strength,\nAligning them with the rightful path—\nThis is how the Sage, though without deliberate kindness,\nYet great kindness arises in action.»\n\nThe Dao/Way’s principles likewise apply when speaking of alchemical cultivation—its essence is the same.\n\nWhen the mind is empty and nature still,\nThe form forgets, the world is forgotten—\nNo kindness need be bestowed.\n\nYet with the interplay of yin and yang qi,\nTheir ceaseless motion and division,\nAt times when yin demons encroach,\nI stand firm in the central realm,\nSummoning divine forces with swift authority—\nThe Thunder Mother’s fire strikes bold,\nFierce winds sweep the Central Mountain’s yin.\nIn an instant, all dark emotions dissolve,\nAs if intoxicated by boundless grace—\nThus arises great kindness,\nAnd the alchemical transformation is complete,\nForging the Elixir’s marvel.\n\n**Ode:**\nHeaven’s kindness is not given, yet vast it springs,\nThe void’s twin qi surges in wrathful flow.\nThunder crashes, winds rage—all tremble and rise,\nCreation’s ways defy the heart’s desires.\n\nWhen joy is boundless, nature overflows with ease,\nWhen stillness is perfect, virtue shines with purity.\nHeaven’s deepest self-interest\nBecomes universal when applied with right intent.\nThe bird’s mastery lies in qi.\n\nTrue joy is wholeness of spirit,\nTrue stillness is wholeness of essence.\nThus, the spirit unbroken knows no wrath,\nWhile nature’s ease abounds with grace.\nThe essence untainted by desire,\nIts stillness gleams with purity.\n\nThe Venerable Laozi taught the essence of peace:\n*\"Heaven grants the body spirit,\nEarth grants the body essence,\nThe harmony of both is qi.\nIf one treasures essence and rejects desire,\nNurtures qi and cherishes spirit,\nWithin, the body attains longevity;\nWithout, the land achieves great peace.\nMoreover, inner perfection manifests outwardly—\nClarity of nature brings bodily stillness,\nMastery of fate completes the Elixir.\nWhen nature and fate are both preserved,\nJoy overflows, stillness gleams with virtue.\nHeaven’s deepest self-interest\nBecomes universal when applied with right intent.\"*\n\nFor the bird’s mastery lies in qi—\nA metaphor urging focus:\nThe heart is the bird, the spirit its fire,\nThe Southern Phoenix’s flame.\nHeed this warning: concentrate on regulating qi,\nUse qi as medicine, spirit as incantation,\nHarness timing, refine with method—\nThen yin transforms to yang,\nThe recognizing spirit becomes the True Person,\nMerging into oneness.\nBones grow light, the body soars—\nLike birds in boundless sky,\nAll through mastery of qi.\nThus, the immortals are called *Feathered Guests*.\n\nShi Jianwu said:\n*\"Qi is the elixir to prolong life,\nThe heart directs qi, the spirit guides.\nWhoever knows to govern qi’s master\nHas grasped the way to transcendence.\"*\n\n**Ode:**\nQi steadied, spirit harmonized—joy overflows,\nAn empty heart, pure and frugal, nurtures the true form.\nWhen the Elixir is complete, it aligns with Heaven’s enduring way,\nThe body, like birds, ascends to the boundless void.\n\nLife is death’s root;\nDeath is life’s root.\nKindness arises from harm,\nHarm arises from kindness.\nThese four—life, death, kindness, harm—\nYin and yang in constant return,\nOpposites interdependent:\nWhere life is, death lurks;\nWhere death is, life takes hold.\nWhere kindness is, harm may hide;\nWhere harm is, kindness may dwell—\nThus the flow of fate unfolds.\n\nCommon folk, clinging to life’s excess,\nTheir hearts ensnared by the world,\nPlant the seeds of death.\nBut if they abandon desire, guard their portion,\nSevering attachments, purifying the source,\nThey grasp life’s root.\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Greed for others’ gain is loss;\nLoss becomes gain when met with wisdom.\"*\nThus the Sage perceives this truth with clarity:\nWhen the heart arises from things,\nIt is death—kill the heart;\nWhen the heart dies,\nThe Dao lives within.\n\nYin Xi’s True Person declared:\n*\"Hear the Dao at dawn,\nDie to the heart by dusk.\"*\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* teaches:\n*\"Do not dwell in form and give rise to mind;\nDo not dwell in sound, scent, taste, or touch—\nWhere contact arises, the mind takes form.\n\nThe learned, hindered by their cleverness,\nensnared by the written word,\nrefuse to bow and seek instruction.\n\nThe Perfect Ones, exhausting their own nature’s Dao/Way,\nmerely search for scripted texts on the surface—\ncounting the Dao/Way’s patterns,\nspeaking swiftly and decisively,\nand they thus take this as virtue/power.\n\nAh! How utterly foolish they are.\nFrom the perspective of those who follow the Dao/Way,\nthey are the true fools.\n\nI say that those who grasp the Dao/Way’s patterns with wisdom are the wise—\nfor such are those who truly perceive the Dao/Way,\nwho encompass the four seasons’ transformations\nand all things’ principles,\nand integrate them into their own being,\nilluminating the depths to become the Sage.\n\nAs the Yellow Emperor gazed upward and downward,\nobserved the markings of birds and beasts,\nand took from near and far,\nhe first drew the Eight Trigrams\nand established written symbols.\n\nAgain, like the Yellow Emperor’s wide consultations,\nor Confucius’ many studies,\nis this not the path from wisdom to virtue/power?\n\nSome recent commentaries halt here,\nbut I have examined the *Taiji Dan* version\nannotated by the True Person Dan Zhenren\nand Zhang Gu Lao’s version—\nboth continue with **216 characters in 21 sentences**,\nexquisitely expressed.\nThis should be taken as the authentic text.\nLater editions omit these lines—\nerrors in transmission,\nnot the original intent.\n\nThe verse says:\n*\"Fools debate the empty void externally,\nclinging to principles, bound by words—\ntheir nature remains impenetrable.\nDo they know the marvels of my family’s Dao?\nThe morning sun rises, crimson on the peaks.\"*\n\nOthers take ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power,\nI take **not** ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power.\nOthers take strangeness and expectation as virtue/power,\nI take **not** strangeness and expectation as virtue/power.\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"Plunge into water, enter fire—\nself-destruction awaits.\"*\n\nThose who take ignorance and virtue/power as virtue/power\nrefer to those who seek meditation or the Dao/Way\nbut lack proper guidance.\nThey begin without a true teacher’s instruction,\nmerely clinging to dull emptiness as their nature,\nstudying no scriptures,\nfixating on a single lifeless thought—\na heart of stone, withered wood—\nobsessively grasping a notion,\nneither desiring nor seeking.\nThey deem this virtue/power,\nyet they know not:\nthe fool who guards an empty hole\nwill never catch the mouse.\nOr like one who drills ice seeking fire,\nbut never finds the fire.\n\nI say that those who truly practice must\nconsult a luminous master,\nunlock profound insights,\nmaster all scriptures,\nand penetrate the deepest mysteries—\nwhat is this so-called *nature*?\nWhat is this so-called *fate*?\nHow does one refine *nature*?\nHow does one forge *fate*?\n\nGo back and forth in inquiry until you reach that point where inquiry itself is exhausted—only then are you free from folly. When you arrive at this state, you need but a single word: *\"subtract\"*—let all entanglements be diminished until they reach *wuwei* (non-action). Then, naturally, wisdom shines forth, the Dao/Way flows with spontaneity, and responses arise with divine clarity. Thus, I say you are free from folly and attain sainthood.\n\nHave you not heard that the sage Shun was ever eager to question and examine even the smallest matters? That Yu, upon hearing a single good word, would bow in reverence? That Yan Hui, upon gaining one virtue, would cherish it deeply and never lose it? The Way of these three sages was nothing but a love of learning, and yet they attained it. With the resources of today’s people, how could they hope to succeed without study?\n\nThe *Sutra of Guiding Beings* says: *\"One must penetrate the ultimate truth of these words.\"*\n\nPeople who seek sainthood through the extraordinary are deluded. They say: *\"Those who practice do not seek the true teachings but cling to bizarre sects and minor methods—strange arts to deceive others.\"* Like sorcerers and shamans who dabble in mud-and-water elixirs, selecting beautiful women as crucibles, using the Three Peaks as their battlefield, relying on the Unshakable Spear for salvation, extracting female essence, and making the Yellow River flow backward as their elixir foundation. They take in much but produce little, calling this *\"refining fire.\"* Such perversions disrupt the true Dao.\n\nOthers use their hands as yin-yang swords, taking female menstrual blood as their elixir foundation. Others abandon their wives, fast, rinse their mouths with saliva, circulate qi, rub and convulse, absorb the essences of sun and moon, burn reeds and play with fire—such methods number in the thousands.\n\nThey believe these tricks will bring sainthood. The *Elixir Scripture* says: *\"The Dao/Way has three thousand six hundred methods, yet each person clings to one as their root.\"* Yet they do not know that the true essence of Daoist subtlety lies beyond these three thousand six hundred methods.\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* also says: *\"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows—like dew or lightning. Thus, one must observe them in this way.\"*\n\nI say that those who seek sainthood without relying on the extraordinary are correct. True practitioners of the Dao/Way govern the world with effortless ease. Internally, they preserve their true nature and cultivate their purity; externally, they respond to circumstances with spontaneity. In times of peace, they find joy in non-action; when demons arise, they suppress their emotions in an instant. Naturally, without contrivance, they embody the highest principle.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction.\"* This has two meanings.\n\nFor those who dabble in strange arts, they stray from the true Dao, lose their genuine path, and exhaust their vital roots. Such people court their own ruin by plunging into their own cauldrons of fire and water.\n\nBut for those who truly understand the Dao, when refining the elixir, they follow the *wuji* (Steel-Water) method: letting the *wu* (Steel, metal) descend into the watery abyss to grasp the *kan* (Water) yang and supplement the *li* (Fire) yin. After achieving *qian* (Heaven), they retreat the *ji* (Earth) to restore the elixir pearl to the divine chamber. Through fire’s purification, impurities dissolve, and the body and mind merge as one. The boundless void opens—this is why it is said: *\"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction.\"*\n\nMaster Yin’s *Exposition on the Scripture Platform* says:\n*\"The heart obscured by mystic speech sinks into the underworld,\nwhile true nature, enlightened by profound words, aligns with Heaven’s will.\"*\n\nThe ode says:\n*The foolish cling to six hollow unions, using tricks to deceive their own nature.\nI follow the Dao of effortless stillness—\ngolden elixir refined, the furnace glows red.*\n\nThe Dao/Way of nature is still, and thus all things flourish.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail.\nWhen yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally.\n\nThe Dao/Way of nature is still—this means the Heavenly Principle moves spontaneously, the four seasons breathe their qi naturally, and all things arise from this effortless stillness. Thus, the sage embodies the Heavenly Principle and acts in accordance with nature, governing the world without contrivance. Therefore, the people of the four seas rejoice in the nameless simplicity.\n\nThus *Laozi* says:\n*\"Practice the teaching of non-action.\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail—this means Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, and the two do not communicate. Thus, Heaven and Earth are blocked, resulting in solitary yin and scarce yang. When the two qi become imbalanced, the five stars lose their courses, the sun and moon clash, the seasons fall out of order, winter thunders, summer snows, droughts and floods ravage the land, and all things wither.\n\nMaster Peng says:\n*\"When yang fire burns excessively, drought and flood go unchecked, turning winter into great heat.\nWhen the *yinfu* (Yin Symbol) loses its rhythm, cold and warmth clash, turning summer into thick frost.\"*\n\nIf the Golden Palace fails to nurture the cinnabar and mercury, then pests and calamities arise—greatly, causing mountains to collapse and earth to split, with the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon churning in chaos; or slightly, with violent rains and howling winds, as the *kan* (Water) male and *li* (Fire) female escape their bounds.\n\nWhen yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally—this means yin and yang have the mystery of separation and union, and water and fire have the method of *ji* (completion). Gathering herbs according to the seasons and aligning with the stars, yin and yang naturally interact, and transformation flows in harmony. Thus, form and spirit are both perfected, and one attains true unity with the Dao.\n\nThe ode says:\n*The Dao of nature is still, and all things thrive complete.\nWhen yin and yang are misaligned, imbalance follows.\nTo grasp the reversal of yin and yang is to cast off old age,\nreturning to youth and matching Heaven’s longevity.*\n\nThus, the sage knows that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied and acts accordingly. The most profound stillness transcends even the measurements of calendars and divinations. Strange instruments give rise to all phenomena. The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms. The arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols.\n\nThus, this is the concluding summary of the essence within the three chapters of the *Yinfu Jing* (Yin Symbol Scripture).\n\nThe term *\"sage\"* is an honorific for those who embody virtue and power.\n\n*\"To know that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied\"* means: Having understood that the Great Dao is the natural principle, one must uphold this natural Dao without deviation—seeking nothing else.\n\nThus, *\"to act accordingly\"* means: My body’s **qi**—like the **spirit-energy** of dragons and tigers—is hard to train and discipline, so I must follow the **cosmic cycles** and turn with the seasons, countering the **yin-yang revolutions** of the **Five Phases** to subdue it. A student who grasps this truth can refine the **elixir of immortality**.\n\n*\"The most profound stillness\"* transcends even calendars and divinations: When the **inner alchemy** is complete, the **true emptiness** shines clear, like a sky without clouds for ten thousand *li*. At that moment, form and objects are forgotten, **nature** is still and boundless, and words and images cannot capture it—how could calendars and divinations ever measure this?\n\n*\"Strange instruments\"* refers to the **Three Treasures** blended together, nurturing the **soul elixir** to pierce stone and transmute gold, changing at will—this is the **nameless instrument**, which is not strange at all? When a **great adept** possesses this **strange instrument**, they wield the **Great Transformation** as easily as one’s fingers, giving rise to the **Ten Thousand Phenomena**, the **Eight Trigrams**, and the **Heavenly Stems**.\n\n*\"The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms; the arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols\"* means: The **divine spirit-energy** is fierce and unyielding; the **ghostly forces** submit and hide. When **yin is exhausted and yang is pure**, the **embryonic transformation** reaches its peak. From this point, the **spirit** ascends to dwell in the **cinnabar field** (the **brain’s upper cavity**), but one must tread firmly on the earth and carefully preserve it. When the **celestial gate** bursts open and the **yang spirit** seeks to emerge, do not let it stray lightly—wait until it is cherished like a newborn child, strong enough to walk, before the **spirit** can depart.\n\nThus it is said: There are **arts of yin-yang victory**; when the **inner work** is complete and the **outer practice** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign** is naturally moved to send **imperial decrees** summoning you. Then, your body rides the **cloud chariot**, your **crane-like ascent** shines with **radiant light**, enveloping the **heavenly fragrance** of **imperial favor**, ascending to the **Jade Capital** and **Golden Gates**, entering the **palaces of the immortals** according to your **merits and cultivation**. Is this not the clear manifestation of the **arts of yin-yang victory** in their symbols?\n\nLike **Yellow Emperor** of **Xuanyuan**, who ascended with his **consorts and ministers** seventy-two in number on a **dragon** from **Ba Mountain**; or **Emperor Shun**, who ascended in **Cangwu** at the **Five Elders’** home when they presented the **decree**; or **Zhang Daoling**, the **Celestial Master** of the **Han**, and **Xu Jingyang**, **Ge Xianweng** of the **Jin**, who all ascended with their **wives and children** in broad daylight to become **ministers of the Golden Gates**.\n\nThe **Dao of the Immortals** is indeed verified. How many **adepts** have there been from ancient times to today?\n\nStudents must not dismiss the **Immortal Way** as absurd and lose heart. The key is to **truly believe** and then seek a **worthy teacher** for direct transmission, diligently practicing without hesitation. Then, the **Heavenly Immortals** will naturally recommend you, and you will surely attain the **rank of the Immortal Sage**—this is no idle claim.\n\nThe **Hymn** says:\n*\"The embryonic immortal is nurtured, free from yin’s constraints,*\n*Worshipping the **Highest Venerable** in the **Jade Void**.*\n*The **arts of yin-yang victory** manifest clearly,*\n*Soaring like cranes and phoenixes, riding the **cloud chariot**.*\n*The **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yinfu Jing* **interprets and illuminates**,\n*Completing the **volumes of the Way’s essence**.\"*",

      "translated_text": "**Title:**\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing with Interlinear Commentary and Exegesis*\n(*Huangdi Yinfu Jing Jiashong Jiezhu*)\n\n**Author:**\nCompiled by Daoist Wang Jie (style name Daoyuan) of the Yuan-Ming period. Three scrolls.\nSource text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, *Tongzhen* section, *Yujue* category.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Yellow Emperor’s Yinfu Jing* with Interlinear Commentary and Exegesis**\n\n*\"Heaven follows humanity, humanity follows Heaven\"*—this is the purpose of the *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nIn antiquity, the Yellow Emperor, earnest in his devotion to the Dao, ascended Mount Kongtong to pay homage to Guangchengzi and inquire about the ultimate Way, receiving the secret precepts of returning to eternal life. Later, upon Mount Emei, he again paid homage to Huangren, who imparted the *Wuyaya-Sanyi* scriptures, which he kept secret and cultivated, thereby ascending to the highest immortality. Worried that future generations might lose the true teachings, he composed the *Yinfu Jing* in three sections—upper, middle, and lower—to correspond with the Three Powers (*san cai*), elucidating the marvels of *jing* (essence), *qi*, and *shen* (spirit) in their utmost refinement.\n\nYet fearing that mortals might not grasp the principle of return, he first declared: *\"Observe the Dao of Heaven, grasp Heaven’s movements, and exhaust them.\"* This is the overarching framework of the three sections of the *Yinfu Jing*.\n\nTo know the Dao of Heaven, one must know the Dao of humanity;\nto know the Dao of humanity, one must know the Dao of the Elixir (*dandao*);\nto know the Dao of the Elixir, one must grasp the mechanics of yin-yang motion and stillness;\nto grasp those mechanics, one must know the principles of internal and external return.\n\nKnowing these principles, one refines lead and mercury without missing the proper moment, and governs the elixir fire without failing to observe its signs. As the text states: *\"Cutting off the single source of profit, the adept’s effort is tenfold; three returns of day and night, the adept’s effort is ten-thousandfold.\"* This further teaches that the essence of cultivating the True lies in maintaining an unshaken resolve to gather and refine the mind and body, and secondarily, in applying unremitting *chou-tian* (withdrawal and addition) techniques without interruption.\n\nThe Way of *Quanzhen* is nothing else:\nFirst, *jing* must be complete;\nSecond, *qi* must be complete;\nThird, *shen* must be complete.\n\nFixing the gaze refines the spirit;\nreturning the hearing refines the essence;\nsealing the speech refines the *qi*.\n\nWhen these three completions and three truths are realized, they naturally merge within, and the True Fire polishes the embryo, forming a golden fetus. After ten months of work, yin is exhausted and yang is pure. At this moment, the fetus is shed, the spirit transforms, and the adept manifests without bounds, transcending birth and death to become an indestructible golden body—this is what is meant by *huan dan* (returning the Elixir).\n\nI say that this text is concise yet profound in meaning. Those who fail to comprehend its teachings may seek explanations externally, straying from the Dao, and thus incur the guilt of presumption and madness. Therefore, I have sequentially explicated each passage of the Master’s secret precepts, supplemented with verse and verification, revealing the hidden mechanisms, awaiting those of like mind. I do not presume to exhaust the subject, but hope this may serve as an aid for beginners.",

One yin, one yang—this is the Dao; one begetting, one slaying—this is principle.*\n\n*Heaven begets in spring, when all things arise from yang—this is Heaven’s *ren* (benevolence).\n*Heaven slays in autumn, when all things withdraw into yin—this is Heaven’s *yì* (righteousness).\n*The waxing and waning of yin and yang—this is the Dao’s principle.*\n\n*Thus, the Sage observes Heaven’s Dao, holds principle in mind, and governs the people with *wuwei* (non-action)—this is the Sage’s *ren*.\n*He establishes the Five Punishments to harmonize the laws of the world—this is the Sage’s *yì*.\n*The embodiment and function of *ren* and *yì*—this is the Sage’s Dao.*\n\n*Speaking of Dao’s application: whenever the Winter Solstice arrives within one’s body, one must seal the pass and attain stillness, disperse the mind into fire, refine essence into *qi*, and advance the yang fire upward from the *Tai Xuang Gong* (Supreme Darkness Palace) to the *Nan Gong* (Southern Palace)—this is the principle of Heaven’s begetting.\n*From this point onward, as yang reaches its peak and declines, a single yin arises beneath the five yangs, and one must then gather yang and withdraw the *Yin Fu* (Yin Symbol).\n*Descending from the Jade Mountain to the Upper Capital, then to the Heavy Tower, sending it to the *Kun* position and halting—here, the martial fire is kindled to temper yin into yang—this is the principle of Heaven’s slaying.\n*To circulate this within the body, continuous as if ever-present—is this not the Dao’s principle?\n\n*Master Shao said:*\n*‘When Qian meets Xun, observe the Moon Cavern;\nWhen Earth meets Thunder, tread upon the Heavenly Root.’\n*The Heavenly Root and Moon Cavern drift in leisure—\nThirty-six palaces are all spring.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*‘The yang dragon and yin tiger coil in rotation,\nHeaven’s hidden mechanisms of life and death unfold naturally.\nRefined, the true seed of One-Nine emerges,\nWithin the vessel, spring overflows—Dao eternal.’*\n\n---\n\n**Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nAll things are thieves of humanity;\nHumanity is the thief of all things.**\n\n*Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things*—this means Heaven and Earth generate all things, and the life and form of all things are formed by the interplay of yin and yang’s transformation. At every thought and impulse, Heaven and Earth know.\n*Those who do good are protected by ghosts and spirits;\nThose who do evil are struck by thunder and punishment*—this is how Heaven and Earth govern all things.\n\n*All things are thieves of humanity*—this means all things arise alongside humanity, and within the human body dwell eighty-four thousand worms. Briefly stated: internally, the five viscera are consumed by *qí* and *huí* worms; externally, the skin is attacked by lice and fleas. As *Tan Jing Sheng*’s *Book of Transformation* says:\n*‘The worms that camp within the belly\nPlunder my vital *qi*, melt my spirit-soul,\nSteal my flavors, yet live by them.’*\nThis is how all things steal from humanity.\n\n*Humanity is the thief of all things*—this means humanity is the most refined of all things, encompassing within one mind the principles of all things. It learns from Heaven and Earth to know transformation, from spiders to weave nets, from bees to establish hierarchy, from moles to institute rites, from phoenixes to compose music, from ants to arrange armies. The Sage can take the principles of all things and perfect them within the self—this is how humanity steals from all things.\n\n*In summary, the generation of Heaven, Earth, and humanity all lies within the Great Transformation. Forms steal from forms, things deceive things—none of this is outside the influence of yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*. Only the Daoist, who comprehends the Three Thefts and transcends yin and yang, is free from the Three Corpses’ plunder.*\n\n*Students should ponder this deeply.*\n\n*Ode:*\n*Heaven, Earth, and humanity share in all things’ birth,\nEach family, each orifice holds its own spirit.\nForms steal from forms through yin and yang’s transformation—\nThe enlightened transcend the mundane, entering the Supreme Clarity.\nThe Three Thefts are resolved, the Three Powers are at peace.*\n\n*This follows the earlier discussion of the Three Thefts, thus it says:*\n*The Three Thefts resolved, the Three Powers secure*—this refers to the enlightened one, whose single nature illuminates all principles, who can discern that the body’s four elements are but yin and yang, the Five Phases’ *qi*, artificially combined. Unbound by form, one secretly practices the Symbol Fire to refine form and spirit. When spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies, this is the Golden Elixir’s great medicine, capable of slaying the Three Corpses’ worms. Once the Three Thefts are extinguished, the Three Powers naturally settle.\n\n*As Master Shao said:*\n*‘Having known all things are within me,\nWhy would I separately establish the Three Powers?’*\n\n*Zhang Zǐyáng said:*\n*‘Pursue the Two *Qi* along the Yellow Path,\nUnite the Three Natures in the Primordial Palace.\nWhen spirit is whole, there is no need for sleep;\nWhen *qi* is whole, there is no need for food;\nWhen essence is whole, there is no need for desire.\nWhen practice reaches this point, how could the Three Powers be unstable?’*\n\n*Ode:*\n*The Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within the body,\nThe Heart-Sovereign turns all things, each returning to root.\nWhen Heaven and Earth’s positions are fixed, demons are subdued,\nThe myriad lands enjoy peace under the Sage’s grace.*\n\n*Thus it is said:*\n*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize.\nStir the mechanism, and all transformations settle.’*\n\n*This further elaborates on the Three Powers being secure, thus it says:*\n*‘Eat in season, and the hundred limbs harmonize’*—this means the practitioner must daily regulate the five viscera, ensuring meals are taken at their proper times. If no time is lost, then the three hundred sixty bones and blood-*qi* flow unimpeded throughout the body, with no place unnourished, and illness cannot arise. Having secured bodily health, one can then nurture spirit and embrace *qi*, dwelling eternally in the Central Field, drawing from the *Hua Chi* (Flower Pond) and *Yu Ye* (Jade Liquid) to irrigate the sacred root—its shoots will naturally flourish.\n*As Laozi said:*\n*‘When the Dao prevails in the world, even warhorses are used for manure—\nI alone differ from others, valuing the Mother’s nourishment.’*\n\n*‘Stir the mechanism, and all transformations settle’*—this means when the first yang stirs, one must immediately turn the Dipper’s handle to respond to it. Each practice of the Dao will make the myriad spirits within the body feel at ease.*\"",

cauldron cracks,\nAs roosters take flight and dogs dissolve, the jade furnace stands empty.*\n\n*How can the common man seek such ordinary ways?\nThe Dao’s subtleties are boundless—its mysteries

harmonizes the Five Organs, cleansing them all.\nThe Golden Elixir refines the form, the Divine Fire tempers the spirit—\nEvery pore in the body radiates brilliance.*\n\n*Men know the spirit’s spirit,\nBut fail to grasp the source of the non-spirit’s spirit.*\n\n*The spirit, for its name, is *Ling* [numinous],\nAnd *Xing* [inherent nature].*\n\n*Before the parents were born, its beginning was not known;\nAfter the parents were born, its end was not seen.*\n\n*Most numinous, most sacred,\nMost profound, most subtle—\nIt encompasses all forms,\nIt encompasses all spirits,\nUnborn, unending,\nNeither square nor round.*\n\n*Thus the Pure and True True Person said:\n*‘This spirit is not the spirit of deliberation,\nBut one that stands equal with the Primordial Origin.’*\n\n*This passage speaks of how the student’s daily cultivation must first focus on clarifying inherent nature.\nWithin the heart-mind, one must always maintain purity and stillness,\nNever allowing even a thread of private desire to obstruct it,\nNor clinging to forms while seeking the mysterious.*\n\n*If one merely conjures an intention,\nThe spirit ceases to be spirit.*\n\n*The *Sutra* says:\n*‘The human spirit loves clarity, yet the heart disturbs it—\nThe spirit’s full brilliance lies in the heart’s emptiness, profound silence, and containing the True.\nIt shares its essence with the Great Void,\nIts luminosity with the sun and moon.’*\n\n*In all interactions with affairs and beings,\nOne must let inherent nature respond spontaneously,\nTurning with the natural flow—\nThus the Three Realms are traversed in harmony,\nAnd this is why one does not know the non-spirit’s source of spirit.*\n\n*The True Person said:\n*‘It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds.’*\n\n*The *Diamond Sutra* declares:\n*‘If one seeks the Tathāgata through form and appearance,\nOr through sound and voice,\nThey tread the wrong path and cannot see the Buddha.’*\n\n*These words are

luminosities.*\n\n*This follows the previous explanation of clarifying inherent nature,\nAnd now reveals the method of cultivating life.*\n\n*Having secured the dwelling of inherent nature,\nOne must then attend to the life-gate.*\n\n*If one can cultivate both inherent nature and life,\nOnly then does the form and spirit attain perfect harmony.*\n\n*The method of cultivating life is such:\nThe student may observe the Dao of Heaven,\nWhere the sun and moon revolve, marking the Winter and Summer Solstices,\nAnd the Yin-Yang equilibrium at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes.\nDays accumulate into months,\nMonths accumulate into years—\nThus the sun and moon have their cycles,\nAnd the small and great have their limits.*\n\n*Has it not been heard?\nThe sun belongs to Yang, the moon to Yin;\nThe moon itself has no light, but borrows the sun’s.*\n\n*At the month’s dark and new phases,\nThe Great Yin and Great Yang meet in the same palace,\nAnd the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;\nFrom the second to the third day, the moon gradually departs from the sun,\nAnd the sun’s light shines upon it, generating a small brilliance—\nThe *Hun* grows, the *Po* diminishes.*\n\n*By the eighth day, night and day share equal light—\nThis is called the Upper Crescent.*\n*From here onward, until the fifteenth day at night,\nThe moon faces the sun, its light full and great—\nAt this point, the *Hun* reaches its peak, and the *Po* emerges.*\n\n*From the sixteenth to the seventeenth days onward,\nThe *Po* grows, the *Hun* fades,\nAnd the moon’s light gradually wanes.*\n\n*By the twenty-third day at night,\nThe light is equally divided below—\nThis is called the Lower Crescent.*\n*From here, until the thirtieth day at night,\nThe moon’s light fades completely, returning once more to darkness.*\n\n*Thus it cycles endlessly, without end—\nA natural and effortless movement of Heaven’s Dao.*\n*Therefore, the great cultivator applies this principle within his own body,\nAnd refines the *Fire Elucidation* [周天火候] of the Heavenly Cycle.*\n\n*The sun and moon spoken of here are the spirit and *qi*,\nWater and Fire,\nLead and Mercury,\nAnd inherent nature and emotions.*\n\n*When making the elixir,\nOne must merge spirit with *qi*,\nConsolidating its foundation within,\nAnd letting the spirit soar forth in the *Yin* [Tiger] Hour.\nBy the *Shen* [Monkey] Hour, one must increase the fire,\nAs the sun’s light shines upon the moon—\nGradually, the brilliance grows and strengthens.*\n\n*The essence transforms into *qi*,\nDirectly entering the *Cinnabar Field* [泥丸],\nAs the moon faces the sun—\nFollowing this, Yin emerges,\nAnd according to the *Green Maiden Transmission* [《青女传》],\nThe elixir is withdrawn into the Earthly Palace,\nWhere the sun and moon join as one—\nThe elixir begins to form, small at first,\nBut with deep cultivation, it grows great—\nThus it is said: ‘The sun and moon have their cycles,\nAnd the small and great have their limits.’*\n\n*Diligently gather, diligently refine,\nTimely cook and temper—\nThe True Embryo flourishes,\nWisdom and insight open wide—\nThus it is said: ‘From here arise the sacred works,\nFrom here emerge the divine luminosities.’*\n\n*Praise:\n*The sun and moon cycle endlessly, their work applied—\nThe elixir’s essence is born from the *Dharma-qi* [梵气].*\n*From the subtle to the manifest, the spirit transcends the sacred,\nAnd within the fire, lotuses bloom one by one.*\n\n*As for stealing the mechanism,\nNo one in the world can see or know it.*\n*The noble man attains it and secures his body,\nThe petty man gains it and risks his life.*\n\n*This follows the previous explanation of refining the sun and moon within one’s body,\nAnd thus attaining the sacred works and divine luminosities—\nHence it is said:*\n\n*‘The stealing here refers not to the worldly thievery of common men,\nBut to the method of refining the Heavenly Cycle’s elixir-fire—\nIn a single breath’s time, one can surpass a year’s transformation of Heaven and Earth.’*\n\n*The *Alchemical Canon* says:\n*‘When the Five Phases flow in order,\nA tiger emerges from water;\nWhen the Five Phases are inverted,\nA dragon arises from fire.’*\n\n*Those who practice this Dao\nCannot be confined by Heaven and Earth,\nNor bound by the *Bazi* [六十甲子, sixty-year Heavenly Stem-Earthly Branch cycle].*\n*Thus, the great cultivator is a thief beyond Heaven and Earth.’*",

      "translated_text": "「The *Preface* states:\nThe *Burning Mountain* [1] seals the Dao of Heaven’s theft,\nThe *Great Symbol* [2] hides the subtle mysteries of the Way.\nThe virtuous one attains it and retreats to preserve himself,\nWhile the petty one, once he gains it, acts recklessly.\n\n*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4] therein concludes:\n*Yellow Emperor’s Obscure Precepts* [3]—*Interpretation of the Interspersed Precepts*—[4]—[5] *Master Rúndàoyuān* of *Nánchāng Xiūjiāng* [6] annotates:\nHeaven’s birth and Heaven’s death are the Way’s principle.\nSpeaking in terms of worldly law,\nHeaven’s birth is *yang* [7], Heaven’s death is *yin* [8];\nOne *yin* and one *yang* is called the Way,\nOne birth and one death is called principle.\n\nHeaven’s birth occurs in spring,\nWhen all things arise from *yang*—Heaven’s benevolence;\nHeaven’s death occurs in autumn,\nWhen all things withdraw into *yin*—Heaven’s righteousness.\nThe ebb and flow of *yin* and *yang* are the Way’s principle.\n\nThus, the sage observes Heaven’s Way,\nHolds principle within his heart,\nAnd transforms the people of the world through non-action—this is the sage’s benevolence;\nWith the five punishments [9], he harmonizes the laws of the world—this is the sage’s righteousness.\nBenevolence and righteousness in essence and application are the sage’s Way.\n\nSpeaking in terms of application,\nWhen one encounters the winter solstice [10] within his body,\nHe must close the gate [11] and remain still,\nSending his mind aloft to transform fire,\nRefining essence into *qi*,\nAdvancing the *yang* fire,\nFrom the *Tàixuān Palace* [12] drawing upward to the *Nán Palace* [13]—this is Heaven’s birth principle.\n\nOnce this is done, the *yang* reaches its peak and declines,\nSo when one *yin* arises beneath the five *yang*,\nHe must withdraw the *yang* and suppress the *Obscure Precept* of *yin*.\nFrom *Yùshān* [14] descending to *Chónglóu* [15],\nConveying it to the *Kūn* [16] position and halting,\nIgniting the *Martial Fire* [17] to temper and refine,\nCooking *yin* into *yang*—this is Heaven’s death principle.\n\nCultivating within one’s body,\nContinuously as if sustained—\nIs this not the Way’s principle?\n\n*Master Shào* [18] says:\nWhen *Qián* [19] meets *Xùn* [20], observe the *Moon Cavern* [21];\nWhen earth encounters *léi* [22], tread upon Heaven’s root.\nHeaven’s root and Moon Cavern come and go at leisure,\nThirty-six palaces [23] are all spring.\nThis is what is meant.\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nThe *yang* dragon and *yin* tiger intertwine in circles,\nHeaven’s birth and death principles unfold naturally.\nRefining yields the *One Nine* [24] true seed,\nA caldron full of spring—Dao stretches endlessly.\n\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;\nAll things are thieves of man;\nMan is the thief of all things.\nHeaven and Earth are the thieves of all things—\nThis means Heaven and Earth generate all things,\nAnd the vitality of all things,\nNone escape the *yin-yang* transformations that form their bodies.\nEvery thought and intention—Heaven and Earth know them all.\nDoing good brings protection from spirits and gods;\nDoing evil invites punishment by thunder and lightning—\nThis is how Heaven and Earth treat all things.\n\nAll things are thieves of man—\nThis means all things arise alongside man,\nAnd within the human body, eight thousand four hundred insects [25] thrive.\nSpeaking briefly,\nInternally, the five viscera [26] are consumed by *wēngzhì* [27] worms,\nExternally, the skin is attacked by fleas and lice.\nAs *Tán Jǐngshēng*’s *Book of Transformation* [28] says:\n*Wēngzhì* [29] insects, the worms of the belly,\nStruggle with my *qi* and essence,\nMelt my spirit and soul,\nSteal my nourishment,\nAnd yet sustain their own lives.\nThis is how all things steal from man.\n\nMan is the thief of all things—\nThis means man is the most refined of all things,\nOne mind encompassing the principles of all things,\nLearning from Heaven and Earth to know transformations,\nLearning from the *spider* to weave nets,\nLearning from the *bee* to establish hierarchy,\nLearning from the *gopher* to create rituals,\nLearning from the *phoenix* to compose music,\nLearning from the *ant* to arrange armies and formations.\nThe sage can extract the principles of all things to perfect himself—\nThis is how man steals from all things.\n\nIn summary,\nThe birth of Heaven, Earth, and man,\nAll lie within the Great Transformation [30],\nEach form stealing from another,\nEach thing deceiving another,\nNone but the *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* [31] acting thus.\nOnly the Daoist who understands the Three Thefts [32],\nTranscending beyond *yin-yang*,\nWill escape the harm of the Three Corpses [33] stealing from him.\nThe student should ponder this well.\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nHeaven, Earth, and man share the birth of all things,\nEach family and orifice holds its own spirit.\nForms steal from forms through *yin-yang* transformations,\nThe enlightened transcend the mundane to enter *Tàiqīng* [34].\nThe Three Thefts [35] being understood,\nThe Three Powers [36] are at peace.\nThis follows the previous discourse on the Three Thefts,\nTherefore it says:\nWhen the Three Thefts are understood,\nThe Three Powers are at peace—\nThis refers to the Daoist,\nWhose singular nature is awakened and illuminated,\nWhose myriad principles are unified,\nWho can discern that the body’s Four Great Elements [37]\nAre but *yin-yang* and Five Phases *qi* falsely combined.\nHe is not bound by form,\nBut secretly practices the *Obscure Precept* fire\nTo refine body and spirit.\nWhen spirit condenses and *qi* solidifies,\nThis is called the *Great Elixir* [38],\nA medicine capable of annihilating the Three Corpses [33].\nOnce the Three Thefts are extinguished,\nThe Three Powers naturally rest.\n\nAs *Master Shào* says:\nWhen one knows all things are complete within me,\nWhy would he separately establish the Three Powers?\n\n*Zhāng Zǐyáng* [39] thus said:\n*\"Chasing the Two Qì [40] along the Yellow Dao [41],\nUniting the Three Natures [42] in the Primordial Palace [43],\nThe spirit is whole and does not crave sleep,\nThe *qi* is whole and does not crave food,\nThe essence is whole and does not crave desire—\nWhen cultivation reaches this point,\nWhat fear is there that the Three Powers will not be at peace?\"*\n\nThe *Preface* states:\nThe Three Thefts and Three Powers are complete within one’s body,\nThe heart—*sovereign*—[44] turns and governs all things, each returning to its root.\n*Qián* and *Kūn* [45] secure their positions, demons and evils are subdued,\nThe myriad lands are in harmony, bearing the sage’s grace.\nThus it is said:\n*\"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony.\nStir the mechanisms of the body, and all transformations will be at peace.\"*\n\nThis again follows the previous discourse on the Three Powers being at peace,\nTherefore it says:\n*\"Eat in accordance with the seasons, and all bones and joints will be in harmony\"*—\nThis means the student’s daily essentials:\nRegulating the five viscera,\nEating and drinking must not be untimed.\nIf he does not lose the proper timing,\nThen the three hundred sixty bones and joints,\nBlood and *qi* flow unrestricted throughout the body,\nNo place remains blocked,\nAnd ailments will not arise.\nWith his body now healthy and at ease,\nHe can nurture his spirit and embrace his *qi*,\nDwelling in the *Central Field* [46],\nTaking *Huápú* [47] and *Yùyè* [48] elixirs seasonally\nTo irrigate the *Root of the Mysterious* [49],\nAnd its shoots will flourish.\n\nThus *Laozi* [50] said:\n*\"When the world has the Dao,\nEven warhorses are turned back to plow fields.\nI alone differ from others,\nValuing the *Mother of the Ten Thousand Things* [51].\"*",

nature.\nBefore parents conceived, it had no beginning;\nAfter birth, it has no end.\nMost subtle, most sacred,\nMost profound, most refined,\nIt encompasses all forms,\nEmbraces all spirits,\nNeither born nor destroyed,\nNeither square nor round.\n\nThe *White-Purple Pure True Person* thus declared:\n*\"This *shén* is not the *shén* of deliberation,*\n*But stands equal to *Yuānshǐ* [64] himself.\"*\n\nThis section speaks of the student’s daily cultivation—\nFirst, one must clarify the nature,\nKeeping the heart-mind ever serene,\nFree of even a thread of private desire.\nNor should one cling to forms while seeking the mysterious.\nIf but a thought arises,\nThe *shén* is no longer *shén*.\n\nThe *Classic* says:\n*\"The human *shén* loves clarity, yet the mind disturbs it.\nThe marvel of the *shén*’s entirety lies in the heart’s emptiness—\nSilent, containing truth,\nIn harmony with the *Tàixū* [65],\nAs luminous as the sun and moon.\"*\n\nIn all interactions and encounters,\nOne’s nature responds spontaneously,\nTurning with the *Three Realms* [66] in perfect unity—\nThus the saying: *\"One does not know the *non-shén* of *shén*.\"*\n\nThe *True Person Zhang* said:\n*\"It cannot be seen, yet when called, it responds.\"*\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* states:\n*\"Worldly beings seek me through form and sound—\nThese are the paths of delusion,\nAnd they cannot see the *Thus-Come One*.\"*\n\nThus it is said:\n\n*Ode:*\n*\"A single point of Primordial Spirit is the utmost *shén*,\nYet when the *shén* knows its dwelling, it is no longer true.\nIf one awakens to the *shén*’s empty essence,\nThe boundless true void shines without obstruction.\"*\n\nThe sun and moon follow their cycles,\nSmall and great have their fixed measures.\nFrom this, the sacred function arises,\nAnd the divine luminosity emerges.\n\nThis follows the earlier discussion of clarifying the nature’s essence,\nAnd thus expounds the method of nurturing life.\nHaving settled the nature,\nOne must then address the *mìng* [67].\nIf both nature and life are cultivated together,\nOnly then will form and *shén* both attain perfection.\n\nThe secret of nurturing life:\nThe student may observe the *Dao* of Heaven—\nThe sun and moon revolve, marking the *Winter* and *Summer Solstices*,\n*Yīn* and *Yáng* pause at the *Mao-Yǒu Divisions* [68],\nDays accumulate into months, months into years—\nThus the sun and moon have their numbers,\nSmall and great their fixed measures.\n\nHas it not been said:\n*The sun belongs to *Yáng*, the moon to *Yīn*,\nThe moon itself has no light, borrowing the sun’s radiance.*\nAt the *new moon* and *full moon*,\nThe *Great Yin* and *Great Yang* meet in the same palace,\nAnd the moon, at this time, is dark and without light;\nFrom the second and third days onward,\nThe moon drifts farther from the sun,\nAnd the sun’s light strikes it—\nIts brilliance grows, yet it remains small,\nThe *hún* [69] lengthens while the *pò* [70] diminishes;\nBy the eighth day’s night,\nIts light is half-illuminated above—\nThis is called the *Upper Crescent*;\nFrom this point onward, until the fifteenth night,\nThe moon faces the sun, its light full and vast—\nAt this juncture, the *hún* reaches its peak while the *pò* arises;\nOn the sixteenth and seventeenth days,\nThe *pò* grows while the *hún* wanes,\nAnd the moon’s light gradually diminishes;\nBy the twenty-third night,\nIts light is half-illuminated below—\nThis is called the *Lower Crescent*;\nFrom this retreat until the thirtieth night,\nThe moon’s light fades entirely, returning to darkness once more.\nThis cycle repeats endlessly, without end—\nA natural unfolding of Heaven’s transformations.\nThus, the great practitioner embodies this principle within oneself,\nCirculating the *Zhōutiān* [71] fire and timing within the body.\n\nThe *sun* and *moon* refer to:\n*Shén* and *qì*, water and fire, lead and mercury, nature and emotion.\nWhen refining the elixir,\nOne merges *shén* with *qì*,\nConsolidating within—\nThe *shén* flies forth to the *Yín* direction,\nBy *Shēn* hour, the fire advances,\nAs the sun’s light strikes the moon,\nIts brilliance grows and strengthens;\nThe *jīng* [72] flows, transforming into *qì*,\nStraight into the *Níhuán* [73],\nAs the moon faces the sun—\nFollowing this, *Yīn* arises,\nUsing the *Qīngnǚ* [74]’s words,\nThe *Fù* symbol retreats downward into the *Kūn* palace,\nThe sun and moon unite in harmony,\nForming the *Returning Elixir*—\nAt first, the elixir is small,\nBut with deepened practice, it grows vast—\nThus it is said: *\"The sun and moon have their numbers,\nSmall and great their fixed measures.\"*\n\nDiligently gather, diligently refine,\nTimely cooking and tempering—\nThe true embryo flourishes,\nWisdom opens fully—\nThus it is said:\n*\"The sacred function arises,\nAnd the divine luminosity emerges.\"*\n\n*Ode:*\n*\"The sun and moon revolve in their celestial cycles,*\n*The *Dàfàn* [75] *qi* refines the sacred embryo.*\n*From the subtle to the manifest, the *shén* transcends the sacred,*\n*Lotus blossoms unfold within the fire.\"*\n\nIts mechanism is stolen—\nNone in the world can see it,\nNone can know it.\nThe virtuous man who attains it guards it within himself,\nWhile the petty man who grasps it risks his life.\n\nThis follows the discussion of circulating the sun and moon within the body,\nThus the sacred function arises and the divine luminosity emerges—\nHence it is said:\n*\"Its mechanism is stolen\"*—\nThis *thief* is not the common thief of the world,\nBut the method of circulating the *Zhōutiān* fire-symbols.\nA single breath’s work can surpass Heaven and Earth’s year-long transformations.\n\nThe *Alchemical Classic* says:\n*\"The Five

      "translated_text": "「Preceding verse states:\nThe *fúzi* burns mountains to steal the heavens’ secrets,\nThe Great Symbol vanishes—its Dao/Way is subtle and profound.\nThe virtuous man, attaining it, retreats to guard his self,\nThe petty man, once gaining it, acts recklessly.\n\n**Huángdì’s *Yīnxíng Jīng* (夹颂解注) in its upper and lower volumes**\n**The *Rúndào Yuān* (王道渊) of Nánchāng’s *Xiūjiāng* (修江) explains thus:**\n\nThe blind excel in hearing, the deaf excel in sight.\nCut off the source of profit, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher tenfold;\nThreefold return through day and night, and one’s skill surpasses that of a teacher ten thousandfold.\n\nThe blind—those without eyes—\nThe deaf—those who cannot hear.\nIn worldly terms, though a man has two eyes, he may still be blind,\nAnd though his two ears are deaf, his sight may yet be keen.\n\nThis illustrates how ordinary men, driven by insatiable desires,\nFollow the openings where their passions leak,\nPursue the external while neglecting the internal—\nThus, the common man clings to worldly affairs,\nAnd so this metaphor is offered as a warning to the student.\n\nYet speaking of the Dao/Way,\nA great adept’s perfect wisdom flows unimpeded,\nHis divine responses are effortless—\nHis eyes hear, his ears see.\nAh! The marvel of sight and hearing lies not in eyes and ears,\nBut in the divine responses of mind and spirit.\n\nCutting off the source of profit yields tenfold skill over a teacher,\nFor this refers to the cultivation of one’s true nature,\nExtinguishing all desires for gain,\nCleansing the heart to its pure source—\nThus, one attains clarity of spirit,\nYet still cannot match the labor of martial practice.\nHence, it is said that one’s skill is tenfold that of a teacher,\nMerely as a figure to describe the effort of cultivating nature.\n\nEven if one achieves stillness like the void,\nIt remains but the work of the shadow-spirit (*yīnshén*).\nHow much more wondrous is the threefold return of day and night,\nWith its power to restore yang, transmute bones!\n\nOf the threefold return, there are two explanations:\nThe external threefold return refers to the eyes, ears, and mouth,\nThe internal threefold return refers to essence, *qi*, and spirit.\n\nWithin the twenty-four hours,\nExternally, one must return the light of the eyes,\nConcentrate the resonance of the ears,\nSeal the breath of the mouth—\nDay and night, reflecting inward without pause,\nNot for a moment to be interrupted.\nInternally, one must merge the three treasures (*sān bǎo*) into unity,\nNever missing the heavens’ divine opportunities.\nWhen the time arrives for the birth of *yǐn* (癸) from *yīn* (铅),\nOne must suspend the *sùzhū* (黍珠) within the boundless void,\nClutching it firmly without motion,\nAs the spirit soars and sinks to the depths of the sea,\nRefining essence into *qi*,\nDriving it upward to the Southern Palace (*Nángōng*),\nSupplementing *lí* (离) to become *qián* (乾).\nContinuing thus, one refines *qi* into spirit,\nDescending directly to the Yellow Court (*Huángtíng*) and halting.\nThe *xùn* (巽) gate opens in pairs,\nThe great fire warms and refines—\nWithin the space of a meal,\nThe spirit is refined and returns to the void.\n\nThe void resounds with clarity,\nRestoring the original nature—\nThis is the Dao/Way of dual cultivation of nature and life.\n\nThe *Dùrén Jīng* (度人经) states:\n*\"Harmonize the five *qì* (气) in their midst,\nBlend the hundred spirits into unity,\nTen revolutions restore the soul’s essence,\nTen thousand breaths align with the immortals.\"*\n\nThe *Dān Jīng* (丹经) says:\n*\"Do not carve time into divisions of *zǐ* (子) and *wǔ* (午),\nNor fix the *yáo* (爻) and *guà* (卦) to determine *qián* (乾) and *kūn* (坤).\"*\n\nThus, when one practices the Dao/Way once,\nThe myriad heavens resound in distant hymns,\nThe ten thousand lords arrange their rites.\nThe cultivation of the elixir (*dān*)—\nIts merit is boundless.\n\nThreefold return through day and night—\nIs this not ten thousandfold skill over a teacher?\n\n**Preceding verse states:**\nThe blind hear, the deaf see—wondrous mind unites.\nCutting off profit, the heart’s source clears, tenfold the skill.\nThe great medicine’s threefold return through day and night,\nDivine transformations endless—Dao/Way knows no bounds.\n\nMind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.\nIn worldly terms, the common man’s mind is enslaved by form,\nHis day filled with chaotic deeds and recognition,\nHis mind never free from things.\nMind arises from things—it dies by things—\nIts divine responses lie in the two eyes.\n\nWhen any object appears before the eyes,\nLove and attachment stir the mind,\nThe thoughts and perceptions chase outward,\nDay by day, month by month, they grow—\nPlanting the seeds of death below,\nAll trace back to the eyes’ leakage.\n\n*The Lǎozǐ* says:\n*\"Man’s birth is his movement toward death.\nThe people’s disregard for death stems from their excessive pursuit of life.\"*\n\nThe mind is hard to subdue\nBecause its divine responses lie in the eyes.\n\nYet speaking of the Dao/Way,\nA great adept steadies his mind, clears his stillness,\nTaking the Dao/Way as his very self.\nWhenever the mind arises from things,\nHe summons the six transcendent powers (*liùtōng*),\nEmits vast golden light,\nIlluminating the boundless world,\nDeploying the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole to restore it—\nThus, things die while the Dao/Way flourishes,\nIts divine responses rooted in the heavens’ eyes,\nThe flowing, absorbing, and revolving of intent.\n\nThis must be transmitted orally—\nI dare not reveal it openly.\n\nThe *Chuān Lǎo* (川老) annotates *The Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* (金刚经):\n*\"The Vajra treads upon the earth,\nThe flagpole points to the heavens.\nTo know the true foundation,\nLook to the Northern Dipper facing south.\"*\n\n**Preceding verse states:**\nMind arises from things, dies by things—divine responses are clear.\nTen revolutions restore the soul’s essence,\nReturning to the marvelous orifices—\nThe spirit condenses, the *qi* settles, and the Dao/Way flourishes.\n\nThe heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises.\nSwift thunder and fierce winds—\nNone fail to tremble in awe.\n\nThe heavens have no deliberate kindness yet great kindness arises,\nFor the heavens take the birth of all things as their heart,\nThe four seasons’ transformations as natural law—\nHow could they intend to bestow kindness?\n\nIt is because all things arise,\nThat demons and evil forces act in turn,\nTheir rebellion harming the upright—\nThus, the heavens’ great kindness is compelled.\n\nHence, they use thunder to proclaim their edicts,\nAnd unleash fierce winds to display their might,\nSo that all things submit and return to the right.\nThose demons and evil forces that refuse to mend their ways,\nThunder obliterates their forms,\nThe wind’s blades shatter their bodies—\nRemoving one harm to ensure the peace of all.\n\nThe heavens’ awe is manifest—\nHow could they tolerate their transgressions?\n\nThis is how the heavens, though without deliberate kindness,\nYet great kindness arises,\nAnd when great kindness arises,\nSwift thunder and fierce winds tremble in awe,\nTheir divine marvels roused and inspired—\nIn an instant, they fill the void,\nTheir transformations beyond measure.\n\nThe Sage also embodies the Dao/Way and acts accordingly,\nTo bring peace to the people of the world.\nWhen the people are pure and joyful in their transformations,\nNo kindness need be bestowed—\nYet if some rebel and harm the people,\nThe Sage must establish lords and marshal armies,\nDeploying armor and weapons to strike them down,\nRemoving one tyrant to ensure the welfare of the good.\n\nIt is like swift thunder and fierce winds,\nShaking their awe and might,\nShowing the stubborn their strength,\nAligning them with the rightful path—\nThis is how the Sage, though without deliberate kindness,\nYet great kindness arises in action.»",

      "translated_text": "Go back and forth in inquiry until you reach that point where inquiry itself is exhausted—only then are you free from folly. When you arrive at this state, you need but a single word: *\"subtract\"*—let all entanglements be diminished until they reach *wuwei* (non-action). Then, naturally, wisdom shines forth, the Dao/Way flows with spontaneity, and responses arise with divine clarity. Thus, I say you are free from folly and attain sainthood.\n\nHave you not heard that the sage Shun was ever eager to question and examine even the smallest matters? That Yu, upon hearing a single good word, would bow in reverence? That Yan Hui, upon gaining one virtue, would cherish it deeply and never lose it? The Way of these three sages was nothing but a love of learning, and yet they attained it. With the resources of today’s people, how could they hope to succeed without study?\n\nThe *Sutra of Guiding Beings* says: *\"One must penetrate the ultimate truth of these words.\"*\n\nPeople who seek sainthood through the extraordinary are deluded. They say: *\"Those who practice do not seek the true teachings but cling to bizarre sects and minor methods—strange arts to deceive others.\"* Like sorcerers and shamans who dabble in mud-and-water elixirs, selecting beautiful women as crucibles, using the Three Peaks as their battlefield, relying on the Unshakable Spear for salvation, extracting female essence, and making the Yellow River flow backward as their elixir foundation. They take in much but produce little, calling this *\"refining fire.\"* Such perversions disrupt the true Dao.\n\nOthers use their hands as yin-yang swords, taking female menstrual blood as their elixir foundation. Others abandon their wives, fast, rinse their mouths with saliva, circulate qi, rub and convulse, absorb the essences of sun and moon, burn reeds and play with fire—such methods number in the thousands.\n\nThey believe these tricks will bring sainthood. The *Elixir Scripture* says: *\"The Dao/Way has three thousand six hundred methods, yet each person clings to one as their root.\"* Yet they do not know that the true essence of Daoist subtlety lies beyond these three thousand six hundred methods.\n\nThe *Diamond Sutra* also says: *\"All conditioned things are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows—like dew or lightning. Thus, one must observe them in this way.\"*\n\nI say that those who seek sainthood without relying on the extraordinary are correct. True practitioners of the Dao/Way govern the world with effortless ease. Internally, they preserve their true nature and cultivate their purity; externally, they respond to circumstances with spontaneity. In times of peace, they find joy in non-action; when demons arise, they suppress their emotions in an instant. Naturally, without contrivance, they embody the highest principle.\n\nThus it is said: *\"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction.\"* This has two meanings.\n\nFor those who dabble in strange arts, they stray from the true Dao, lose their genuine path, and exhaust their vital roots. Such people court their own ruin by plunging into their own cauldrons of fire and water.\n\nBut for those who truly understand the Dao, when refining the elixir, they follow the *wuji* (Steel-Water) method: letting the *wu* (Steel, metal) descend into the watery abyss to grasp the *kan* (Water) yang and supplement the *li* (Fire) yin. After achieving *qian* (Heaven), they retreat the *ji* (Earth) to restore the elixir pearl to the divine chamber. Through fire’s purification, impurities dissolve, and the body and mind merge as one. The boundless void opens—this is why it is said: *\"To sink into water and enter fire is to court self-destruction.\"*\n\nMaster Yin’s *Exposition on the Scripture Platform* says:\n*\"The heart obscured by mystic speech sinks into the underworld,\nwhile true nature, enlightened by profound words, aligns with Heaven’s will.\"*\n\nThe ode says:\n*The foolish cling to six hollow unions, using tricks to deceive their own nature.\nI follow the Dao of effortless stillness—\ngolden elixir refined, the furnace glows red.*\n\nThe Dao/Way of nature is still, and thus all things flourish.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail.\nWhen yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally.\n\nThe Dao/Way of nature is still—this means the Heavenly Principle moves spontaneously, the four seasons breathe their qi naturally, and all things arise from this effortless stillness. Thus, the sage embodies the Heavenly Principle and acts in accordance with nature, governing the world without contrivance. Therefore, the people of the four seas rejoice in the nameless simplicity.\n\nThus *Laozi* says:\n*\"Practice the teaching of non-action.\nI do nothing, yet the people transform themselves.\nI love stillness, yet the people rectify themselves.\"*\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is fluid, and thus yin and yang prevail—this means Heaven’s qi does not descend, Earth’s qi does not ascend, and the two do not communicate. Thus, Heaven and Earth are blocked, resulting in solitary yin and scarce yang. When the two qi become imbalanced, the five stars lose their courses, the sun and moon clash, the seasons fall out of order, winter thunders, summer snows, droughts and floods ravage the land, and all things wither.\n\nMaster Peng says:\n*\"When yang fire burns excessively, drought and flood go unchecked, turning winter into great heat.\nWhen the *yinfu* (Yin Symbol) loses its rhythm, cold and warmth clash, turning summer into thick frost.\"*\n\nIf the Golden Palace fails to nurture the cinnabar and mercury, then pests and calamities arise—greatly, causing mountains to collapse and earth to split, with the Metal Tiger and Wood Dragon churning in chaos; or slightly, with violent rains and howling winds, as the *kan* (Water) male and *li* (Fire) female escape their bounds.\n\nWhen yin and yang interact harmoniously, transformation flows naturally—this means yin and yang have the mystery of separation and union, and water and fire have the method of *ji* (completion). Gathering herbs according to the seasons and aligning with the stars, yin and yang naturally interact, and transformation flows in harmony. Thus, form and spirit are both perfected, and one attains true unity with the Dao.\n\nThe ode says:\n*The Dao of nature is still, and all things thrive complete.\nWhen yin and yang are misaligned, imbalance follows.\nTo grasp the reversal of yin and yang is to cast off old age,\nreturning to youth and matching Heaven’s longevity.*\n\nThus, the sage knows that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied and acts accordingly. The most profound stillness transcends even the measurements of calendars and divinations. Strange instruments give rise to all phenomena. The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms. The arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols.\n\nThus, this is the concluding summary of the essence within the three chapters of the *Yinfu Jing* (Yin Symbol Scripture).\n\nThe term *\"sage\"* is an honorific for those who embody virtue and power.\n\n*\"To know that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied\"* means: Having understood that the Great Dao is the natural principle, one must uphold this natural Dao without deviation—seeking nothing else.",

At that moment, form and objects are forgotten, **nature** is still and boundless, and words and images cannot capture it—how could calendars and divinations ever measure this?\n\n*\"Strange instruments\"* refers to the **Three Treasures** blended together, nurturing the **soul elixir** to pierce stone and transmute gold, changing at will—this is the **nameless instrument**, which is not strange at all? When a **great adept** possesses this **strange instrument**, they wield the **Great Transformation** as easily as one’s fingers, giving rise to the **Ten Thousand Phenomena**, the **Eight Trigrams**, and the **Heavenly Stems**.\n\n*\"The Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems conceal divine mechanisms; the arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols\"* means: The **divine spirit-energy** is fierce and unyielding; the **ghostly forces** submit and hide. When **yin is exhausted and yang is pure**, the **embryonic transformation** reaches its peak. From this point, the **spirit** ascends to dwell in the **cinnabar field** (the **brain’s upper cavity**), but one must tread firmly on the earth and carefully preserve it. When the **celestial gate** bursts open and the **yang spirit** seeks to emerge, do not let it stray lightly—wait until it is cherished like a newborn child, strong enough to walk, before the **spirit** can depart.\n\nThus it is said: There are **arts of yin-yang victory**; when the **inner work** is complete and the **outer practice** fulfilled, the **Celestial Sovereign** is naturally moved to send **imperial decrees** summoning you. Then, your body rides the **cloud chariot**, your **crane-like ascent** shines with **radiant light**, enveloping the **heavenly fragrance** of **imperial favor**, ascending to the **Jade Capital** and **Golden Gates**, entering the **palaces of the immortals** according to your **merits and cultivation**. Is this not the clear manifestation of the **arts of yin-yang victory** in their symbols?\n\nLike **Yellow Emperor** of **Xuanyuan**, who ascended with his **consorts and ministers** seventy-two in number on a **dragon** from **Ba Mountain**; or **Emperor Shun**, who ascended in **Cangwu** at the **Five Elders’** home when they presented the **decree**; or **Zhang Daoling**, the **Celestial Master** of the **Han**, and **Xu Jingyang**, **Ge Xianweng** of the **Jin**, who all ascended with their **wives and children** in broad daylight to become **ministers of the Golden Gates**.\n\nThe **Dao of the Immortals** is indeed verified. How many **adepts** have there been from ancient times to today?\n\nStudents must not dismiss the **Immortal Way** as absurd and lose heart. The key is to **truly believe** and then seek a **worthy teacher** for direct transmission, diligently practicing without hesitation. Then, the **Heavenly Immortals** will naturally recommend you, and you will surely attain the **rank of the Immortal Sage**—this is no idle claim.\n\nThe **Hymn** says:\n*\"The embryonic immortal is nurtured, free from yin’s constraints,*\n*Worshipping the **Highest Venerable** in the **Jade Void**.*\n*The **arts of yin-yang victory** manifest clearly,*\n*Soaring like cranes and phoenixes, riding the **cloud chariot**.*\n*The **Yellow Emperor’s** *Yinfu Jing* **interprets and illuminates**,\n*Completing the **volumes of the Way’s essence**.\"*",
      "overlap_context": " Stems conceal divine mechanisms. The arts of yin-yang victory are clearly manifested in their symbols.\n\nThus, this is the concluding summary of the essence within the three chapters of the *Yinfu Jing* (Yin Symbol Scripture).\n\nThe term *\"sage\"* is an honorific for those who embody virtue and power.\n\n*\"To know that the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied\"* means: Having understood that the Great Dao is the natural principle, one must uphold this natural Dao without deviation—seeking nothing else.",
