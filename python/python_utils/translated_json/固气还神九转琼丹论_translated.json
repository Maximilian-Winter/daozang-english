  "full_translation": "**Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit: The Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir**\n\n**Title:** *Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit Through the Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir*. One scroll, author unknown, likely composed during the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit**\n\nThe great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the generation of life, and what can be preserved is the body. The source of the body is the primordial *qi* of Heaven, formed by the union of *yin* and *yang* essences. Through the alternation of closure and openness, they interact to become openness (*tai*) or closure (*pi*). Prolonged closure (*pi*) inherently lacks the principle of growth and nurturance, nor can it sustain long-lasting prosperity. If one can emulate this, one may attain a body equal to Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth communicate through *qi*, which delights the spirit. The source of all life lies in the unity of essence (*jing*) and *qi*. If these are constantly preserved, why fear the failure of generation? Essence and *qi* are like the four seasons and the sun and moon: their movement is the norm, while their stagnation is calamity. If the four seasons do not alternate, how can the myriad things be born? If the sun and moon do not intermingle, how can the myriad things be illuminated? Thus, to attempt to restrain essence and *qi* is a great delusion!\n\nAs the *Classic* states: *\"Flowing water does not stagnate; a door hinge does not rot.\"* Movement is superior. If even water and wood are thus, how much more so for essence and *qi*! When essence moves, it lengthens its own essence. Just as *yang* *qi* spreads and grasses and trees flourish, fire blazes fiercely with the aid of wind.\n\nThe union and separation of Heaven and Earth, the ascent and descent of *yin* and *yang*, are the natural Dao. No thing can alter this. The transformation of male and female is the root of generation. Who would abandon this natural root of life and yet hope to endure forever? Those who do not follow the root of the Dao claim that consolidating essence leads to longevity—this is a grave error. If sealing essence could ensure permanence, then a cloth sack could store water.\n\nMoreover, essence transforms into blood, blood into *qi*, and *qi* into essence. The transformations of essence and *qi* are never constant. Even if one does not discharge them below, they may still benefit the body. Yet if one forces essence to wander in the spirit’s palace, perverse *qi* will penetrate the *Mingmen*, becoming an axe that severs life. Laboring essence harms the spirit’s vitality. Moreover, people today merely favor the name of consolidating essence but do not understand how to nurture it. Thus, though consolidation may preserve it temporarily, it ultimately perishes with *qi*. Though essence may move and lengthen, it arises from blood. When blood is abundant, the complexion flourishes; when the brain withers, the hair changes. Flourishing or withering within manifests as transformation without. Yet people observe this but cannot comprehend it.\n\nTo consolidate essence, one must first preserve *qi*; to consolidate *qi*, one must first return essence. Thus, when *qi* is whole, *yang* essence is not depleted; when essence returns, primordial *qi* does not scatter. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Three Spirits return essence, and the old regain their vigor.\"* For essence transforms into *qi* and ascends. If *qi* is not consolidated, essence is exhausted; if *qi* returns as fluid and descends, essence does not return, and *qi* is harmed.\n\nConsider a cauldron of water: initially without *qi*, how does it become *qi*? Because it cannot leak below and is pressed by fire. Once it becomes *qi*, the *qi* rises upward. If there is no restraint above, the *qi* scatters; when *qi* scatters, the water dries up. If below it does not leak and above it does not scatter, water becomes *qi* and ascends, *qi* reverts to water and descends. Up and down circulate endlessly. Thus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"Unobstructed pathways never cease.\"* Such is the subtlety of consolidating essence and nurturing *qi*.\n\nPeople today merely know the benefits of nurturing *qi* but not how to protect it; they know the name of consolidating essence but not its method. If *qi* descends and leaks as essence, what benefit is there in nurturing it? If essence scatters upward as *qi*, what benefit is there in consolidating it?\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* further states: *\"If one can preserve the primordial true, all affairs are complete; the spirit of the body must not be lost.\"* Thus, the Dao lies in transformation. Those who attain the Dao do so through returning and cycling. Transformation can be reversed, cycling reaches the Nine Heavens, and virtue is thereby manifested.\n\n---\n\n### **Treatise on the Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir**\n\nThe source of the numinous elixir is endowed with the *qi* of the True One. The True One is the source-water of the great Dao. Water is *qi*; *qi* is the Dao. The Dao originally has no name; it takes form through *qi*, and we forcibly name it the Dao. When *qi* congeals into form, and form and substance separate, it is named the elixir.\n\nThe *Huachi* revolves and transforms *qi* naturally. Thus, the great elixir examines the *qi* of the True One, employing the divine water of the *Huachi*. The count begins with the Northern *Heche* (River Chariot). The chariot’s count converges, totaling thirty spokes, corresponding to the lunar phases and the thirty days of the month. Each month has six phases, with *yin* and *yang* each occupying half, mutually receiving and employing one another.\n\nInternally, it mirrors the twenty-four *qi*. As *qi* completes one cycle, the elixir completes one cycle, beginning at the *Kan* position in the north, the first of the *yang* signs, symbolizing the hidden dragon extending its virtue. This determines the use of divine water.\n\nThe divine water of the *Huachi* can only receive true lead. If the lead is not true, the divine water cannot receive it; if the mercury is not true, black lead cannot unite with it. Daoist adepts abhor impurities, for impure *qi* is unusable. Thus, one must first determine the divine water before uniting it with true lead.\n\nAs the *Elixir Classic* states: *\"If lead is not true, mercury cannot be stabilized; if lead is true, mercury naturally submits.\"* When subdued, it becomes flowing pearls; flowing pearls transform into golden liquid, also called golden nectar or jade wine. All the above are transformations of the great elixir, guided by the tally of the Dao.\n\nThus, one must first determine the divine water to receive and employ it. Divine water is the dwelling of the great elixir. Within it, refining the essence of lead yields the Yellow Sprout. Gathering this sprout and further refining it, cycling through creation and transformation, after nine cycles, it is named cinnabar, named purple floating sand, named immortal radiance purple ointment, named golden liquid, named returning elixir.\n\nThus, all these arise from the reception and employment of divine water, attaining the number of unity and transforming naturally.\n\nThe number of water belongs to one, containing qi and nourishing the true. Aligned with its position, it is black, uniting with true lead. True lead receives the black qi of the north, being water—yet not the lead of the mundane world. That which resembles true lead is mercury, and it too is not the mercury of the mundane world.\n\nThis lead conceals its light and hides its traces, its transformations occurring naturally. True lead harmonizes with the five colors, responding to the five phases, resonating with creation and transformation—hence it is called \"natural.\" Now sinking, now floating, it can exist or cease to be.\n\nThe *Red Dragon Formula of the Golden Tiger Perfected Lord* states: *\"At times it floats, ethereal and indistinct, vast as clouds; within it lies essence, through which one weaves the warp and weft. Seeming both present and absent, its true nature is hard to discern.\"*\n\nMoreover, \"true\" refers to obtaining the primordial qi of unity, which transforms into a sprout—this sprout differs from lead in the vulgar sense. It is said that when the flower of true lead is formed, it emerges above the lead. Many practitioners of the elixir fail to obtain this flower, mistakenly taking the yellow bloom of common black lead for the sprout—how grievous an error!\n\nThis flower is called *divine radiance flowing pearls*, also named *golden flower liquid*, *yellow essence*, *divine talisman white snow*, or *Yellow Sprout*. The immortals guard this meaning most closely. As Minister Xiao’s *Song of the Great Elixir* says: *\"For a thousand years, it was kept secret—the Yellow Sprout.\"*\n\nWhen this sprout resides in the crucible, it responds to the tally like the seasons, divine and numinous. Its manifold primordial forms all partake of the great work of heaven-and-earth’s natural transformations—truly no easy matter. He who obtains this sprout has already entered the realm of immortals.\n\nHerein lies the essential subtlety of the great elixir, the profound origin of divine water. Yet those who now refine medicines in pursuit of longevity fail to grasp the source of the numinous elixir, vainly seeking cinnabar and mercury.\n\nSince ancient times, the highest immortals have left behind immortal scriptures and cavernous texts of alchemical writings, secret methods transmitted among the immortals. None do not first clarify the divine water and fire, then proceed to the patterns of generation and completion, the mutual employment of the five phases and qian-kun, beginning from non-being into being, then returning to non-being. When the cycles of return are complete, the divine elixir is naturally perfected.\n\nThe cycles return and revert, revert and return, following the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, conforming to the natures of the five phases. For instance, on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, when the moon is full and bright, the elixir’s qi is likewise abundant and luminous. As the moon wanes, a new moon begins to grow—this is called \"generating the primordial qi.\" By analogy, after attaining full brightness, one gathers and subdues it through the nine returns and seven reversions. This is the meaning.\n\nNine marks the beginning of primordial yang, seven the inception of great yin. Yin and yang interact endlessly—hence it is called the Dao. The immortal scriptures also say: *\"When return and reversion are without error, essence congeals and does not fly away.\"*\n\nIf one extracts mercury from cinnabar or takes the sprout from lead frost, or uses the eight stones, three yellows, five metals, or miscellaneous substances, none of these are the source of the great elixir. They may be refined by methods to alter and enhance their properties, becoming treasures to aid the poor, sustain the Dao, and rescue the destitute. But if one takes these coarse substances as the elixir, what can be achieved?\n\nThe immortal scriptures say: *\"Taking a knife-tip’s measure at dawn, by dusk one may grow feathers and wings.\"* How could such inert matter possess this power? Alas! How grievous!\n\nThe immortal scriptures also say: *\"The Purple Floating Canopy Elixir—one *zhū* enables a person to ascend to heaven.\"* The Primordial Yang Lord states: *\"That which generates form from formlessness is the returning elixir; common mercury and vulgar cinnabar are not worth refining.\"*\n\nNow, \"formlessness\" refers to the divine water’s flower pool, while \"form\" is the congealing of the divine water’s qi. The great elixir arises from divine water, receiving qi and coming into being, then taking form through qi. As the *Laozi* commentary by Master Heshang says: *\"Only in the indistinct and vague does the One reside; through cultivation, transformation is established, and form arises from qi.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nThe immortals take water as their foundation, transforming qi to form the \"child.\" When child and mother long for each other, it is called the great elixir. The child receives qi and takes shape; the elixir is endowed with water and establishes its form. This clarifies that it is born through receiving qi—this is the secret method shared among immortals, never lightly disclosed, for it is profoundly difficult.\n\nThough water has form, ultimately it has no substance. The immortals refine it with their methods, and through ascent, it can generate substance anew. When it ascends, the yang qi in the crucible rises; when it descends, the yin qi in the vessel congeals below. This clearly explains how the qi of emptiness and non-being coalesces into the elixir.\n\n\"Emptiness and origin\" refers to the vessel’s interior, which receives the two qi. The two qi—one yin and one yang—unite in copulation to become the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao.\"*\n\nOnce ascent and descent attain their proper measure, the numinous form of emptiness and origin naturally arises. Hence it is said: *\"That which generates form from formlessness is the returning elixir.\"*\n\nImmortal Yin states: *\"When transformation completes the form, it is being within non-being; when the numinous yin entrusts its form, one knows non-being within being.\"* This refers to the time of opening the crucible each month to bathe the elixir, adding the Green Dragon and bathing the White Tiger. All becomes formless, its shape unseen—hence it is called \"non-being within being.\"\n\nYet one must rely on the water clock, reverse-calculating the five phases, aligning with the Dipper’s movement, advancing and retreating in proper measure. If the time for advancing water or fire occurs during the forenoon division of the water clock, burn incense without cease and supplicate the highest perfected ones.\n\nWhen the qian fire blazes brightly, fearing the crucible may be lost, one must not briefly abandon the alchemical chamber. Instead, listen attentively to the dragon’s roaring at its dominant position. Carefully observe the yin and yang, adjusting the timing. If one hears the male sound growing fierce, briefly open the noon gate.\n\nAbove the noon gate lies the *sì* gate, which severs the qian fire. The male’s fierceness is hard to bear, so briefly opening the noon gate admits the yin fire, using yin to restrain the yang qi, gradually harmonizing its clear and serene resonance. Gently regulate the fire qi—its sound should be clear and serene, then swiftly close it again, lest the qi dissipate. If the timing is prolonged or obstructed, the divine elixir’s transformations may be disrupted.\n\nIf the time for advancing water and retreating fire arrives...\n\nAt the time of the *Pregnancy* Hexagram, one yin faces five yangs. The primal power of Kun is smooth and prosperous, and the myriad things take form, bearing and submitting to Heaven—thus in the end there is blessing.\n\nWhen treading frost, solid ice forms: yin begins to congeal. In the height of summer, thunder shakes, mercy veils its might, and the bud’s body gradually takes shape. With cultivation unerring, when the water clock marks the second watch, it is precisely the *Return* Hexagram’s auspicious moment.\n\nThe *Great Change* says: \"Matching yin to yang is the pivot of the Dao’s mechanism. The hidden tiger treading frost shines brilliantly.\" When solid ice freezes with cold, at this moment the elixir transforms and congeals into liquid.\n\nThe divine water has already changed, the great Dao’s work is complete, and creation is accomplished—thus the Yellow Sprout has substance. Refined through nine transformations, its numinous essence becomes observable. It is called the *Old Sprout*, and with this the method reaches maturity.\n\nWhen this sprout is refined to nine revolutions, it may resemble layered stalactites, towering and jagged rocks, or square *tadpole* script, veined agate, or translucent jade pillars—each displaying wondrous and extraordinary forms. Only when the nine revolutions’ transformations are nearly complete is it gathered as the foundation of the great medicine, after which the Reverted Elixir is refined.\n\nThe *Jade Flask Ode of the Perfected Lord of Great Unity* says:\n*\"In the tenth month, snow flies and frost grows thick;\nWithin, the Yellow Sprout ripens, its color bright and clear.\nIf you see the Yellow Sprout is ripe in your elixir-refining,\nHow could you not think of the Golden Tiger and Dragon?\"*\n\nTo \"think of the Golden Tiger and Dragon\" means the Yellow Sprout is already ripe, and one must next refine the great medicine into the elixir. The Dragon and Tiger are the names of the Golden Elixir. Though this sprout is ripe, it is but a solitary yang sprout—yin and yang are not yet complete, and it is not yet fit to be the great medicine. Only when the Azure Dragon and White Tiger are re-matched does it become the great medicine.\n\nThe *Triple Concordance* says: \"A solitary yang sprout cannot stand alone; only when water unites yin and yang does it become the great medicine.\" This sprout is the foundation of the Reverted Elixir and the root of the great medicine. Without reopening creation and reordering generation, nothing can be achieved.\n\nThe water for compounding the elixir must be clarified, and only after more than a month may it be used. The water for compounding the elixir should be settled for over a month, lest impurities dull the elixir’s radiance. Store it in a vessel of gold or silver, and allow no dust to enter.\n\nThe water for compounding the elixir has degrees of lightness and heaviness, softness and hardness—its weight can be known by the water clock. The heavy may be used, for it is the stone spring that connects the yang meridians.\n\nThe Most High said: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\" The transformations of the Golden Elixir follow the principle of spontaneity. That which attains the One is the divine water—hence it is called the *Flower Pool of Divine Water*.\n\nThe Dao of immortals is to embrace the One, merging and receiving qi to give life. Moreover, water’s nature is purely yang, yet its form is purely yin. A hundred *hu* poured into a cauldron and boiled dry reveal its lack of substance. Yet a single drop moistening the great earth gives life to the myriad things. That it has substance is only because it openly steals qi to form it—this is water.\n\nEven things steal qi to live; the secret of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water, the *Flower Pool of Divine Water*. Thus it is said: \"Of the hundred arts guarding the Golden Elixir, the wonder lies in the divine water of the Flower Pool.\" This formula is of utmost celestial sincerity, yet people remain unaware. Therefore, when the Golden Elixir obtains water, the sprout’s signs flourish—how could it not arise from the formless? It is the divine water.\n\nIf one extracts mercury from cinnabar or takes the sprout from lead flowers, the qi types differ and cannot unite with the Dao. Moreover, the divisions of the clepsydra must clearly match the Five Phases, day and night’s turning jade, and the movements of the celestial tally.\n\nThe tally corresponds to the twelve hours; the numbers beneath each hour match the clepsydra’s tally, transforming the great elixir’s five-colored radiance. All is made so by the tally’s command. Without neglecting left or right, listen attentively to the sounds and chants. If the timing is even slightly off, previous efforts may be lost.\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Consider the Golden Liquid Elixir: it must contain saliva and bear liquid, dissolving into a thick fluid—hence it is called *Golden Liquid*. If one uses cinnabar to produce mercury, or quicksilver to form frost, where is the *Golden Liquid*? Such practices lack ancient verification, misinterpret the classics, and rely on personal whim—departing from the Dao and betraying virtue. A thousand families may squander their wealth, yet nothing is achieved. Truly, the world is foolish; who can awaken them?\"\n\nIn refining the elixir, one must first recognize true lead, then engage in creation’s work. If one does not know the origin of the numinous elixir, one merely wastes treasures.\n\nMaster Guangcheng said: \"If refining the Upper Clarity’s divine elixir, one must grasp the root and source, know water and fire, understand the weights of medicinal substances, and align with the clepsydra’s primordial work. Thus, following Heaven’s way, nothing will fail to succeed.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"Heaven and Earth transform, and the sage emulates them; Heaven hangs forth the myriad images, and the sage patterns himself upon them.\" Moreover, just as the pulse circulates through the body and the clepsydra flows through a hundred marks, time follows the clepsydra’s tally, and the hour is fixed by the marks. Since the clepsydra never stops, the elixir transforms with the hour. When the elixir’s transformation accords with the measure, it matches the tally and follows the hour. With the hour unerring, it harmonizes with Heaven’s Dao. When Heaven’s timing is in accord, creation finds its return—this is called the *Reverted Elixir*. Is this not patterning after Qian and Kun, driving the sun and moon, completing the Three Powers, and perfecting the Four Images?\n\nIt begins in emptiness and nothingness, fashioning being from non-being. Moreover, in fixing the nodes and dividing qi, generally every five days marks a *hou*, and transformations shift accordingly. Thus it is said: \"After five days, the sparrow enters the water and transforms into a clam; after another five days, the wild duck enters the water and transforms into a giant clam.\" The principle of the elixir’s origin mirrors creation. Likewise, after five days, the divine water and frozen elixir form a unity—this is the shared transformation of Heaven and humanity, the concord of pitch pipes and calendars.\n\nNow, if today’s tally is in effect, the *Recovery* Hexagram is activated, and the great numbers of water and fire are set in motion. The Qian and Kun hexagrams’ two lines govern the twelve hours’ numbers, within which there is yin and yang, brightness and darkness, movement and stillness, advance and retreat. The Dipper’s handle turns, circling the market, shifting with the hexagrams’ changes. Five-colored radiance flows, beloved by Heaven and humanity alike.\n\nThis method is inscribed on golden tablets for external display, yet its essence may be preserved within the heart—far from the ears of the vulgar and common. The immortal precepts warn: \"When Heaven’s gates open and Earth’s portals split, the sage’s mechanism must not be recklessly divulged.\" How, then, could it be lightly discussed?\n\nThe alchemical scriptures declare: \"Should one attain the source of the elixir, success may yet be achieved in one chance out of ten thousand.\" Yet success must bring benefit to all. When this elixir is perfected, its merit extends to the entire household, lifting not merely one individual to ascension.\n\nYet observe those of today who refine the elixir: though they speak of it, their words lack substance. Morning after morning they discourse on the medicine, day after day they expound on the cinnabar, yet when pressed on the true source, they remain ignorant of its wondrous purport. How, then, could such as these benefit the multitude or elevate their entire household?\n\nThe immortal classics state: \"Without attaining the elixir’s source, even one body cannot be perfected; but if the divine water is understood, the whole family returns to the True.\" The alchemical scriptures say: \"Divine water and sacred stone, one dragon and one tiger—these two are the origin of all things, with the immortals as their heralds.\" Those who attain it progress daily, ever renewed.\n\nTo speak of attaining the elixir’s source is to engage in practice with unwavering faith: each month a union is made, the crucible opened for bathing, the elixir’s hue observed, its hidden origin gradually revealed. Through this, one’s resources for enlightenment are transformed, and the Dao is daily renewed. The provisional Dao upholds Oneness; the provisional Dao’s guiding principles lie in the wondrousness of guarding the One.\n\nThe reckoning of the rising *jia*-day marks the spring’s sprouting of life. The scriptures say: \"The Dao of the Three Ones—Heaven and Earth constantly wax and wane with the seasons, traversing the earth and returning to the Central Palace, where the number of the center is five.\" The alchemical texts state: \"The Three, the Five, and the One are the purest essences of Heaven and Earth; though they may be transmitted orally, they defy written conveyance.\"\n\nThe essence of the Great Elixir cannot be achieved without numbers; the divine water and the Flowery Pond cannot be harmonized with the Dao without authenticity. Only by guarding the One does one grasp the guiding principles of the Dao.\n\nHeaven is impartial—yet of all things it nurtures, it cherishes humanity most deeply. The primal patterns of Heaven’s mechanism are scrutinized without exception. When the Dao is perfected and virtue accomplished, one moves the Jade Emperor to gratitude. Only goodness may draw near, for Heaven bears witness.\n\nMy life is in my own hands:\nIt is not Heaven that grants me existence,\nnor Heaven that cuts short my years.\nThe revolving jade and the white sun—\nthrough these, one may preserve youthful countenance,\npursue longevity,\nand attain it through effort.\n\nWithout the elixir, there is no transcendence.\nThe human body weighs over a hundred pounds—\nhow could it ascend lightly?\nWithout the golden elixir, there is no means to purge and refine.\nOnce the divine medicine transforms,\nold age reverts to youth,\none is ranked among the Perfected,\nand one’s name is inscribed in the Jade Register.\nOne’s lifespan equals Heaven’s,\none’s duration matches Earth’s—\nthus it is said: without the elixir, there is no transcendence.\n\nRefinement requires time.\nThe concoction of the divine elixir is not the work of a single day or night.\nAfter nine revolutions, the sprout forms;\nafter nine revolutions of the sprout, the elixir is complete.\nAll must align with the workings of creation:\none must seek renowned mountains and blessed sites,\nprepare provisions for dawn and dusk,\ngather several fellow practitioners,\nand arrange the medicine chamber, altar, furnace,\ndug well, and lightning rods.\nAt dawn and dusk, offer thanks,\nnever harboring frivolous thoughts.\nLet aspiration and destiny return to the True,\nand spirit and clarity become as one.\nHow could this be easy?\nOnly after years does it come to fruition—\nthus refinement requires time.\n\nIngestion brings ever-renewing vitality.\nAfter taking the medicine,\nthe Three Corpses and Nine Worms gradually recede,\nessence is restored, marrow replenished, and all is made whole.\nIn dark chambers, one’s radiance shines at night;\nthe youthful complexion daily flourishes,\nthe spirit grows exceptionally bright,\nand the Dao’s qi emanates auspicious light.\nThe numinous Perfected of the Five Peaks come to pay homage,\nthe hun-soul and spirit attain penetrating vision,\nthe jade marrow and golden body roam the immortal realms,\nabiding in ever-renewing bliss.\n\nWhen numbers align, transformation occurs.\nThe great reckoning of the Five Phases circulates through the four seasons;\nonce the pitch-pipes complete their cycle,\nthe numinous elixir transforms of itself.\n\nWhen numbers reach their limit, the numinous manifests.\nYin and Yang cannot surpass the numinous—\nwhen Yin reaches its extreme, Yang lies hidden;\nwhen Yang reaches its extreme, Yin withdraws.\nThe two qi interact in mutual use,\nthis is the Dao’s spontaneity.\nThe extreme is the exhaustion of change—\nthus it is said: when change is exhausted, the numinous is complete.\nThrough the numinous, the Dao is illuminated;\nwhen the reckoning of Yin and Yang reaches its limit,\ntransformation occurs in an instant.\n\nAttaining this celestial mechanism,\nof all the world’s endeavors,\nnone surpasses the Dao.\nOf the Dao’s wonders,\nnone surpass the principles of the elixir.\nOf the elixir’s wonders,\nnone surpass qi.\nWhen qi transforms into form,\nnone surpasses numbers.\nWhen numbers create the golden elixir—\nthe Three, the Five, and the One—\npreserving this celestial mechanism,\nthe work of immortality is complete.\n\nOne is eternally ranked among the Perfected.\nThough the world abounds with peripheral and miscellaneous doctrines—\nten thousand in number—\nto speak of eternal ranking among the Perfected,\nonly a single grain of the Returned Elixir suffices for ascension.\nThus concludes the *Discourse on the Nine-Revolved Elixir of Fixed Qi and Restored Spirit*.",

      "translated_text": "**Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit: The Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir**\n\n**Title:** *Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit Through the Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir*. One scroll, author unknown, likely composed during the late Tang or Five Dynasties period. Base text from the *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongxuan* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Treatise on Consolidating Qi and Returning the Spirit**\n\nThe great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the generation of life, and what can be preserved is the body. The source of the body is the primordial *qi* of Heaven, formed by the union of *yin* and *yang* essences. Through the alternation of closure and openness, they interact to become openness (*tai*) or closure (*pi*). Prolonged closure (*pi*) inherently lacks the principle of growth and nurturance, nor can it sustain long-lasting prosperity. If one can emulate this, one may attain a body equal to Heaven and Earth.\n\nHeaven and Earth communicate through *qi*, which delights the spirit. The source of all life lies in the unity of essence (*jing*) and *qi*. If these are constantly preserved, why fear the failure of generation? Essence and *qi* are like the four seasons and the sun and moon: their movement is the norm, while their stagnation is calamity. If the four seasons do not alternate, how can the myriad things be born? If the sun and moon do not intermingle, how can the myriad things be illuminated? Thus, to attempt to restrain essence and *qi* is a great delusion!\n\nAs the *Classic* states: *\"Flowing water does not stagnate; a door hinge does not rot.\"* Movement is superior. If even water and wood are thus, how much more so for essence and *qi*! When essence moves, it lengthens its own essence. Just as *yang* *qi* spreads and grasses and trees flourish, fire blazes fiercely with the aid of wind.\n\nThe union and separation of Heaven and Earth, the ascent and descent of *yin* and *yang*, are the natural Dao. No thing can alter this. The transformation of male and female is the root of generation. Who would abandon this natural root of life and yet hope to endure forever? Those who do not follow the root of the Dao claim that consolidating essence leads to longevity—this is a grave error. If sealing essence could ensure permanence, then a cloth sack could store water.\n\nMoreover, essence transforms into blood, blood into *qi*, and *qi* into essence. The transformations of essence and *qi* are never constant. Even if one does not discharge them below, they may still benefit the body. Yet if one forces essence to wander in the spirit’s palace, perverse *qi* will penetrate the *Mingmen*, becoming an axe that severs life. Laboring essence harms the spirit’s vitality. Moreover, people today merely favor the name of consolidating essence but do not understand how to nurture it. Thus, though consolidation may preserve it temporarily, it ultimately perishes with *qi*. Though essence may move and lengthen, it arises from blood. When blood is abundant, the complexion flourishes; when the brain withers, the hair changes. Flourishing or withering within manifests as transformation without. Yet people observe this but cannot comprehend it.\n\nTo consolidate essence, one must first preserve *qi*; to consolidate *qi*, one must first return essence. Thus, when *qi* is whole, *yang* essence is not depleted; when essence returns, primordial *qi* does not scatter. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"The Three Spirits return essence, and the old regain their vigor.\"* For essence transforms into *qi* and ascends. If *qi* is not consolidated, essence is exhausted; if *qi* returns as fluid and descends, essence does not return, and *qi* is harmed.\n\nConsider a cauldron of water: initially without *qi*, how does it become *qi*? Because it cannot leak below and is pressed by fire. Once it becomes *qi*, the *qi* rises upward. If there is no restraint above, the *qi* scatters; when *qi* scatters, the water dries up. If below it does not leak and above it does not scatter, water becomes *qi* and ascends, *qi* reverts to water and descends. Up and down circulate endlessly. Thus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *\"Unobstructed pathways never cease.\"* Such is the subtlety of consolidating essence and nurturing *qi*.\n\nPeople today merely know the benefits of nurturing *qi* but not how to protect it; they know the name of consolidating essence but not its method. If *qi* descends and leaks as essence, what benefit is there in nurturing it? If essence scatters upward as *qi*, what benefit is there in consolidating it?\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* further states: *\"If one can preserve the primordial true, all affairs are complete; the spirit of the body must not be lost.\"* Thus, the Dao lies in transformation. Those who attain the Dao do so through returning and cycling. Transformation can be reversed, cycling reaches the Nine Heavens, and virtue is thereby manifested.\n\n---\n\n### **Treatise on the Nine Cycles of Jade Elixir**\n\nThe source of the numinous elixir is endowed with the *qi* of the True One. The True One is the source-water of the great Dao. Water is *qi*; *qi* is the Dao. The Dao originally has no name; it takes form through *qi*, and we forcibly name it the Dao. When *qi* congeals into form, and form and substance separate, it is named the elixir.\n\nThe *Huachi* revolves and transforms *qi* naturally. Thus, the great elixir examines the *qi* of the True One, employing the divine water of the *Huachi*. The count begins with the Northern *Heche* (River Chariot). The chariot’s count converges, totaling thirty spokes, corresponding to the lunar phases and the thirty days of the month. Each month has six phases, with *yin* and *yang* each occupying half, mutually receiving and employing one another.\n\nInternally, it mirrors the twenty-four *qi*. As *qi* completes one cycle, the elixir completes one cycle, beginning at the *Kan* position in the north, the first of the *yang* signs, symbolizing the hidden dragon extending its virtue. This determines the use of divine water.\n\nThe divine water of the *Huachi* can only receive true lead. If the lead is not true, the divine water cannot receive it; if the mercury is not true, black lead cannot unite with it. Daoist adepts abhor impurities, for impure *qi* is unusable. Thus, one must first determine the divine water before uniting it with true lead.\n\nAs the *Elixir Classic* states: *\"If lead is not true, mercury cannot be stabilized; if lead is true, mercury naturally submits.\"* When subdued, it becomes flowing pearls; flowing pearls transform into golden liquid, also called golden nectar or jade wine. All the above are transformations of the great elixir, guided by the tally of the Dao.\n\nThus, one must first determine the divine water to receive and employ it. Divine water is the dwelling of the great elixir. Within it, refining the essence of lead yields the Yellow Sprout. Gathering this sprout and further refining it, cycling through creation and transformation, after nine cycles, it is named cinnabar, named purple floating sand, named immortal radiance purple ointment, named golden liquid, named returning elixir.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, all these arise from the reception and employment of divine water, attaining the number of unity and transforming naturally.\n\nThe number of water belongs to one, containing qi and nourishing the true. Aligned with its position, it is black, uniting with true lead. True lead receives the black qi of the north, being water—yet not the lead of the mundane world. That which resembles true lead is mercury, and it too is not the mercury of the mundane world.\n\nThis lead conceals its light and hides its traces, its transformations occurring naturally. True lead harmonizes with the five colors, responding to the five phases, resonating with creation and transformation—hence it is called \"natural.\" Now sinking, now floating, it can exist or cease to be.\n\nThe *Red Dragon Formula of the Golden Tiger Perfected Lord* states: *\"At times it floats, ethereal and indistinct, vast as clouds; within it lies essence, through which one weaves the warp and weft. Seeming both present and absent, its true nature is hard to discern.\"*\n\nMoreover, \"true\" refers to obtaining the primordial qi of unity, which transforms into a sprout—this sprout differs from lead in the vulgar sense. It is said that when the flower of true lead is formed, it emerges above the lead. Many practitioners of the elixir fail to obtain this flower, mistakenly taking the yellow bloom of common black lead for the sprout—how grievous an error!\n\nThis flower is called *divine radiance flowing pearls*, also named *golden flower liquid*, *yellow essence*, *divine talisman white snow*, or *Yellow Sprout*. The immortals guard this meaning most closely. As Minister Xiao’s *Song of the Great Elixir* says: *\"For a thousand years, it was kept secret—the Yellow Sprout.\"*\n\nWhen this sprout resides in the crucible, it responds to the tally like the seasons, divine and numinous. Its manifold primordial forms all partake of the great work of heaven-and-earth’s natural transformations—truly no easy matter. He who obtains this sprout has already entered the realm of immortals.\n\nHerein lies the essential subtlety of the great elixir, the profound origin of divine water. Yet those who now refine medicines in pursuit of longevity fail to grasp the source of the numinous elixir, vainly seeking cinnabar and mercury.\n\nSince ancient times, the highest immortals have left behind immortal scriptures and cavernous texts of alchemical writings, secret methods transmitted among the immortals. None do not first clarify the divine water and fire, then proceed to the patterns of generation and completion, the mutual employment of the five phases and qian-kun, beginning from non-being into being, then returning to non-being. When the cycles of return are complete, the divine elixir is naturally perfected.\n\nThe cycles return and revert, revert and return, following the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, conforming to the natures of the five phases. For instance, on the fifteenth and sixteenth days, when the moon is full and bright, the elixir’s qi is likewise abundant and luminous. As the moon wanes, a new moon begins to grow—this is called \"generating the primordial qi.\" By analogy, after attaining full brightness, one gathers and subdues it through the nine returns and seven reversions. This is the meaning.\n\nNine marks the beginning of primordial yang, seven the inception of great yin. Yin and yang interact endlessly—hence it is called the Dao. The immortal scriptures also say: *\"When return and reversion are without error, essence congeals and does not fly away.\"*\n\nIf one extracts mercury from cinnabar or takes the sprout from lead frost, or uses the eight stones, three yellows, five metals, or miscellaneous substances, none of these are the source of the great elixir. They may be refined by methods to alter and enhance their properties, becoming treasures to aid the poor, sustain the Dao, and rescue the destitute. But if one takes these coarse substances as the elixir, what can be achieved?\n\nThe immortal scriptures say: *\"Taking a knife-tip’s measure at dawn, by dusk one may grow feathers and wings.\"* How could such inert matter possess this power? Alas! How grievous!\n\nThe immortal scriptures also say: *\"The Purple Floating Canopy Elixir—one *zhū* enables a person to ascend to heaven.\"* The Primordial Yang Lord states: *\"That which generates form from formlessness is the returning elixir; common mercury and vulgar cinnabar are not worth refining.\"*\n\nNow, \"formlessness\" refers to the divine water’s flower pool, while \"form\" is the congealing of the divine water’s qi. The great elixir arises from divine water, receiving qi and coming into being, then taking form through qi. As the *Laozi* commentary by Master Heshang says: *\"Only in the indistinct and vague does the One reside; through cultivation, transformation is established, and form arises from qi.\"* This is the meaning.\n\nThe immortals take water as their foundation, transforming qi to form the \"child.\" When child and mother long for each other, it is called the great elixir. The child receives qi and takes shape; the elixir is endowed with water and establishes its form. This clarifies that it is born through receiving qi—this is the secret method shared among immortals, never lightly disclosed, for it is profoundly difficult.\n\nThough water has form, ultimately it has no substance. The immortals refine it with their methods, and through ascent, it can generate substance anew. When it ascends, the yang qi in the crucible rises; when it descends, the yin qi in the vessel congeals below. This clearly explains how the qi of emptiness and non-being coalesces into the elixir.\n\n\"Emptiness and origin\" refers to the vessel’s interior, which receives the two qi. The two qi—one yin and one yang—unite in copulation to become the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"One yin and one yang—this is called the Dao.\"*\n\nOnce ascent and descent attain their proper measure, the numinous form of emptiness and origin naturally arises. Hence it is said: *\"That which generates form from formlessness is the returning elixir.\"*\n\nImmortal Yin states: *\"When transformation completes the form, it is being within non-being; when the numinous yin entrusts its form, one knows non-being within being.\"* This refers to the time of opening the crucible each month to bathe the elixir, adding the Green Dragon and bathing the White Tiger. All becomes formless, its shape unseen—hence it is called \"non-being within being.\"\n\nYet one must rely on the water clock, reverse-calculating the five phases, aligning with the Dipper’s movement, advancing and retreating in proper measure. If the time for advancing water or fire occurs during the forenoon division of the water clock, burn incense without cease and supplicate the highest perfected ones.\n\nWhen the qian fire blazes brightly, fearing the crucible may be lost, one must not briefly abandon the alchemical chamber. Instead, listen attentively to the dragon’s roaring at its dominant position. Carefully observe the yin and yang, adjusting the timing. If one hears the male sound growing fierce, briefly open the noon gate.\n\nAbove the noon gate lies the *sì* gate, which severs the qian fire. The male’s fierceness is hard to bear, so briefly opening the noon gate admits the yin fire, using yin to restrain the yang qi, gradually harmonizing its clear and serene resonance. Gently regulate the fire qi—its sound should be clear and serene, then swiftly close it again, lest the qi dissipate. If the timing is prolonged or obstructed, the divine elixir’s transformations may be disrupted.\n\nIf the time for advancing water and retreating fire arrives...",

Though this sprout is ripe, it is but a solitary yang sprout—yin and yang are not yet complete, and it is not yet fit to be the great medicine. Only when the Azure Dragon and White Tiger are re-matched does it become the great medicine.\n\nThe *Triple Concordance* says: \"A solitary yang sprout cannot stand alone; only when water unites yin and yang does it become the great medicine.\" This sprout is the foundation of the Reverted Elixir and the root of the great medicine. Without reopening creation and reordering generation, nothing can be achieved.\n\nThe water for compounding the elixir must be clarified, and only after more than a month may it be used. The water for compounding the elixir should be settled for over a month, lest impurities dull the elixir’s radiance. Store it in a vessel of gold or silver, and allow no dust to enter.\n\nThe water for compounding the elixir has degrees of lightness and heaviness, softness and hardness—its weight can be known by the water clock. The heavy may be used, for it is the stone spring that connects the yang meridians.\n\nThe Most High said: \"Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; the myriad things attain the One and come to life.\" The transformations of the Golden Elixir follow the principle of spontaneity. That which attains the One is the divine water—hence it is called the *Flower Pool of Divine Water*.\n\nThe Dao of immortals is to embrace the One, merging and receiving qi to give life. Moreover, water’s nature is purely yang, yet its form is purely yin. A hundred *hu* poured into a cauldron and boiled dry reveal its lack of substance. Yet a single drop moistening the great earth gives life to the myriad things. That it has substance is only because it openly steals qi to form it—this is water.\n\nEven things steal qi to live; the secret of the Golden Elixir lies in the divine water, the *Flower Pool of Divine Water*. Thus it is said: \"Of the hundred arts guarding the Golden Elixir, the wonder lies in the divine water of the Flower Pool.\" This formula is of utmost celestial sincerity, yet people remain unaware. Therefore, when the Golden Elixir obtains water, the sprout’s signs flourish—how could it not arise from the formless? It is the divine water.\n\nIf one extracts mercury from cinnabar or takes the sprout from lead flowers, the qi types differ and cannot unite with the Dao. Moreover, the divisions of the clepsydra must clearly match the Five Phases, day and night’s turning jade, and the movements of the celestial tally.\n\nThe tally corresponds to the twelve hours; the numbers beneath each hour match the clepsydra’s tally, transforming the great elixir’s five-colored radiance. All is made so by the tally’s command. Without neglecting left or right, listen attentively to the sounds and chants. If the timing is even slightly off, previous efforts may be lost.\n\nThe Perfected One said: \"Consider the Golden Liquid Elixir: it must contain saliva and bear liquid, dissolving into a thick fluid—hence it is called *Golden Liquid*. If one uses cinnabar to produce mercury, or quicksilver to form frost, where is the *Golden Liquid*? Such practices lack ancient verification, misinterpret the classics, and rely on personal whim—departing from the Dao and betraying virtue. A thousand families may squander their wealth, yet nothing is achieved. Truly, the world is foolish; who can awaken them?\"\n\nIn refining the elixir, one must first recognize true lead, then engage in creation’s work. If one does not know the origin of the numinous elixir, one merely wastes treasures.\n\nMaster Guangcheng said: \"If refining the Upper Clarity’s divine elixir, one must grasp the root and source, know water and fire, understand the weights of medicinal substances, and align with the clepsydra’s primordial work. Thus, following Heaven’s way, nothing will fail to succeed.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"Heaven and Earth transform, and the sage emulates them; Heaven hangs forth the myriad images, and the sage patterns himself upon them.\" Moreover, just as the pulse circulates through the body and the clepsydra flows through a hundred marks, time follows the clepsydra’s tally, and the hour is fixed by the marks. Since the clepsydra never stops, the elixir transforms with the hour. When the elixir’s transformation accords with the measure, it matches the tally and follows the hour. With the hour unerring, it harmonizes with Heaven’s Dao. When Heaven’s timing is in accord, creation finds its return—this is called the *Reverted Elixir*. Is this not patterning after Qian and Kun, driving the sun and moon, completing the Three Powers, and perfecting the Four Images?\n\nIt begins in emptiness and nothingness, fashioning being from non-being. Moreover, in fixing the nodes and dividing qi, generally every five days marks a *hou*, and transformations shift accordingly. Thus it is said: \"After five days, the sparrow enters the water and transforms into a clam; after another five days, the wild duck enters the water and transforms into a giant clam.\" The principle of the elixir’s origin mirrors creation. Likewise, after five days, the divine water and frozen elixir form a unity—this is the shared transformation of Heaven and humanity, the concord of pitch pipes and calendars.\n\nNow, if today’s tally is in effect, the *Recovery* Hexagram is activated, and the great numbers of water and fire are set in motion. The Qian and Kun hexagrams’ two lines govern the twelve hours’ numbers, within which there is yin and yang, brightness and darkness, movement and stillness, advance and retreat. The Dipper’s handle turns, circling the market, shifting with the hexagrams’ changes. Five-colored radiance flows, beloved by Heaven and humanity alike.",

If the timing is prolonged or obstructed, the divine elixir’s transformations may be disrupted.\n\nIf the time for advancing water and retreating fire arrives...",
