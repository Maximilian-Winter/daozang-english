Rites of Salvation for Humanity—Opening and Closing Ceremony for Morning, Afternoon, Evening (Late), and Threefold Rites*\nOne scroll.\n\nSource: *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era (正统道藏),* *Tongxuan Section (洞玄部),* **Rituals of Awe and Reverence (威仪类).**\n\n**Golden Seal Tenfold Rites of Salvation for Humanity—Late Rite Opening Ceremony**\n*(After the Fast of Pure Intentions)*\n\n**Threefold Refuges**\n**Praise of Past Lives**\nThough one has faith in past lives, the weak and bereaved are called without.\nAll wish to behold the present, yet upon seeing, they speak of the boundless.\n\nGreat sages teach the Dao/Way with clarity,\nTheir sorrowful pity extends to the obstinate.\n\nWith deep compassion, they ponder our suffering,\nTheir earnestness brings me grief.\n\n**Recitation of the Ninth Rite’s Opening Scripture**\n\nWith reverence, I present the **Tongxuan Red Scriptures** with **voided green and purple characters**—\nNine radiant clouds blaze with color, all bearing the **lustrous golden rays and jade inscriptions**;\nEight dragons form the text, their strokes **chiseled from jade and cast in gold**.\n\nHidden within the **Upper Purity Domain (上清之境)** and the **Cold Spirit Hall (寒灵之殿)**,\nThey rest upon the **erect void table (立空之案)** and the **frosted silk cloth (霜罗之巾)**.\nThe sun and moon rely upon them to move eternally, never ceasing;\nThe sovereigns receive them to safeguard the realm, ensuring **enduring peace for ten thousand generations**.\n\nOh, how magnificent and abundant they are—\nNone can surpass them!\n\nNow, I humbly follow the imperial edict,\nDiligently crafting the **Golden Seal**,\nExtending the **auspicious fast (延禧大斋)** for several days and nights.\n\nI lead the officials and congregation,\nAscending the platform for the **ninth recitation** of the *Supreme Lord’s Tongxuan Lingbao Sutra of Infinite Salvation for Humanity (太上洞玄灵宝无量度人上品妙经)*,\nOffering homage to the **Sacred Edicts (宝诰)**,\nAnd with

power (慈悲愿力)**,\nAnd the **sacred efficacy of the scriptures (主盟经功)**.\n\nI pray that the **Mysterious Truth (玄真)** may illuminate**,\nAnd the **Supreme Saints (上圣)** guide us with their hands.\n\nMay the **Divine Radiance (神光)** illuminate our **source of wisdom (慧源)**,\nAnd the **Dao/Way’s vital essence (道炁)** flow through our **spiritual faculties (灵府)**.\n\nThus, may we **study with utmost care and ponder deeply**,\nNever neglecting the **great principles** we can attain;\nAnd **search for hidden meanings and probe profound truths**,\nCertainly comprehending the **utterances of ultimate wisdom** before ceasing.\n\nMay our merit benefit **all beings of land and water (水陆)**,\nAnd our virtue extend to **the realm and the people (邦家)**.\n\nWith bowed head to the **Void Sovereign

signifies the completion of gold,\nso I vent my gratitude to the **Earthly Treasure (地藏)**.\n\nThe heavens do not cherish the Dao/Way,\nyet scriptures emerge in the world;\nthe earth does not treasure jewels and gems,\nyet gold and jade manifest in form.\n\nIn days of old, **Laozi** descended upon **Chu’s capital (蜀都)**,\nand the earth surged forth a jade array;\nthe **Void Sovereign (虚皇)** wandered the western lands,\nand the earth naturally presented yellow gold.\n\nFor the divine efficacy transcends prescription—\nits numinous responses are ever constant.\n\nNow, having led the
