  "full_translation": "**Supreme Petition of the Three Caverns**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Supreme Petition of the Three Caverns*\nThree fascicles.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Cavern Spirit Section, Petitions and Memorials category.\n\n**Fascicle One of the Supreme Petition of the Three Caverns**\n\n**Vermilion Memorial for Universal Salvation and Deliverance from Suffering**\n\nYour humble servant, [Name], of lowly rank, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully addressing the throne:\n\nThis unworthy servant, a speck of dust and blade of grass, by mere fortune of past blessings, has been graced with favor and light, granted registers and promotions, transmitted scriptures and received the Dao. Yet I remain dull and ignorant, my faults deep as abysses, my merits lighter than a mustard seed. Though I have humbly received nurturance, I have not been punished for my transgressions. To repay the grace of salvation and deliver beings, I dare not presume.\n\nYour servant respectfully submits the intent of this retreat.\n\nI deeply fear that in the netherworld’s winding paths, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Iron Enclosure and the Unrelenting Prison, beneath layers of darkness and dense gloom, the souls of the condemned languish, bound for eternity without release. If they do not return their spirits to the Azure Ultimate and petition the Azure Radiance, invoking universal compassion, how shall they escape? Only by approaching the Mysterious Threshold at dawn to receive refinement and rebirth may this be achieved. Thus, I, foolish though I am, humbly present this memorial to ascend to the Azure Palace, beseeching the power of wisdom and mercy, the might of the divine to bestow grace. May the wondrous *qi* of the Azure Mystery, the radiance of a hundred treasures, pierce the dense gloom, illuminate the endless night, and shine without fail across heaven above and heaven below. May the departed soul [Name] transcend the dark abyss, realize the wondrous emptiness of the void, have sins absolved and transgressions pardoned, and ascend to the Golden Towers.\n\nYour servant respectfully invokes the Azure Mystery’s Youths of Salvation, Jade Maidens of Salvation, and the Envoys of the Nine-Dragon Talismanic Command, to ascend to the Palace of Everlasting Joy in the Eastern Ultimate. At the Jade Steps, may they request the descent of the Nine-Dragon Talismanic Command of the Eastern Florescence, proclaiming it to the boundless divine realms of the ten directions, the shadowy paths and hidden passes, and all places of punishment and confinement. For the departed [Name], may they swiftly expunge the ledgers of sin, eradicate the roots of evil, and guard body and soul, granting immediate liberation.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Azure Mystery’s Divine Officers of the Yellow Register for Prison-Breaking, the Wardens of Prison-Breaking, the Talisman-Bearing Divine Officers, and the Flying Dragon Couriers of the Talismanic Command, to descend as one. May they issue decrees to shatter the netherworld’s dungeons, command the underworld’s officials, and cause the flames of the Fire Mountain to subside, the waves of the Ice Pool to still, the sword trees to transform into blossoming groves, and the blade forests into jade trees. May the hells crumble, the iron cities open, and the departed spirits be released from torment, drawn to the altar’s steps to behold the light.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Celestial Officers of the True Light of the Great Unity to Guide Souls, the Divine Officers of the Three *Qi* of Red Light to Transform Souls, the Envoys to Seek Souls across the Six Paths, the Judges of the Night-Shining Summons, and the Swift Flying Cloud Divine Officers, to descend as one. May they pursue and retrieve the true soul and correct spirit of the departed [Name], returning them to the yang realm, where they may bathe, change garments, pay homage to the perfected, and receive sustenance.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the True Bureau of Refinement and Salvation of the Southern Prosperity Palace of the Vermilion Mound Fire Treasury, the Jade Maidens and Youths of the Yellow Florescence, and the Generals of Water and Fire, to descend as one. May they specially refine and purge the departed [Name], scouring away worldly filth, tempering karmic miasmas, illuminating within and without, and purifying body and spirit.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Jade Maidens of Harmonious Mystery and Numinous Radiance, the Divine Officers of Left and Right Upholding Rectitude, the Flying Cloud Officers of Soul-Recording and Merit-Registering, the Jade Clarity Inspectors of Talismanic Verification, and the Flying Cloud Divine Officers of Transcendent Travel and Register-Shifting, to descend as one. May they specially examine and oversee the departed [Name], ensuring just assessment, recommending rebirth, recording meritorious deeds, guiding the soul to transcendence, excising their name from the ghostly registers, and inscribing it in the celestial bureaus, that they may forever dwell as a seed of immortality, free from further cycles.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Celestial Officers of the Free and Joyous Wandering Souls, the Divine Officers of the Mysterious Salvation of the Crooked and Perverse, the Jade Maidens of Merit and Achievement, and the Great Gods of the Registry, to lead the departed [Name] to ascend to the Palace of the Mysterious Life of the Great Unity. May they pay homage at the Lotus Throne, wander and feast in wondrous splendor, their bodies suffused with jade light, their clothing and nourishment self-sustaining. May auspicious mists dispel death, and propitious clouds usher forth life.\n\nMay the Five Sufferings and Three Paths all realize the fruit of non-action; may the Four Births and Six Destinies swiftly transcend the realm of defilement.\n\nMay the blessings of earth and heaven universally bestow their benefits, and may Your boundless compassion deign to regard our earnest plea.\n\nYour humble servant respectfully invokes the Azure Mystery Jade Maidens, the Azure Mystery Merit Officers, the Four Direct Jade Script Officers, the Divine Assembly Officers of the Dao, and the Flying Celestial Envoys of the Ten Directions—each to attend in their singular authority.\n\nOn behalf of [Name], your servant humbly presents a vermilion memorial of salvation to the Heavenly Gate of the Eastern Culmen. May the celestial grace respond in kind. With reverence and awe, your servant bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this entreaty.\n\nYour servant, [Your Name], of [Your Prefecture, County, and Abbey], presently engaged in the purification rites at the Palace of Everlasting Joy within the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Culmen, addresses the Most Merciful and Compassionate, the Ever-Responsive, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering, the Jade August One.\n\nIn the [Year] of the Great Year Star, on the [Day] of the [Month], at [Location], your servant, with utmost reverence, prostrates himself and submits this Eastern Culmen Memorial.\n\nThis month, on the [Day], for the pious disciple [Name] who has established the Azure Mystery Wondrous Fast of Salvation from Suffering for [Number] days and nights, to deliver the soul of the departed [Name], your servant respectfully presents this memorial.\n\nIt is humbly observed that when the Vermilion Radiance unfolded the cosmic chart, the loving sun circulated through the Six Directions; when the Azure Mystery governed the turning of the ages, auspicious mists flourished in the Nine Netherworlds. The luminous white jade light shines forth, and the resplendent purple-golden form illumines all. Ever-responsive to cries for aid, ever-compassionate to those who invoke, Your boundless deliverance knows no limit, and thus we turn in devotion and make our plea.\n\nWith reverence and awe, your servant bows his head to the ground, reflecting upon the soul of the departed [Name], lingering in the snares of the worldly net, traversing the mechanisms of dust. In the thousand-fathom sea of desire, they drift upon wild waves; in the ten-thousand-ren river of attachment, they cannot escape the surging currents. Their spirit drowned in a single moment, their steps sank into the ninefold night. The copper gates clang shut, the iron ramparts enclose all around. In silent sorrow, they vainly long for a path to life; in frantic anguish, they suddenly realize there is no gate to salvation from death. Had they not turned their lives toward the Azure Flower, how could their souls ascend beyond the Yellow Turbidity?\n\nWe reverently invoke the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Culmen, the Palace of Everlasting Joy, the Most Merciful and Compassionate, the Ever-Responsive, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering, the Jade August One. Your majestic power pervades all, Your wisdom and strength encompass the universe. In the seven-jeweled forest of towering trees, You pour forth the radiant sweet dew; upon the nine-hued lotus throne, You spread the resplendent clouds of compassion. Your true light blankets the great thousand worlds, and Your auspicious qi unfurls across the hundred millions. All who dwell within Your transforming influence are surely uplifted and guided.\n\nMay Your sagely virtue shine forth, and Your divine might surge boundlessly. Command the immortal officers of the Nine Bureaus to govern the earth and uphold the celestial decrees; proclaim the true officers of the Two Courts to manifest the Dao and magnify the heavenly principles. Record their merits upon the cinnabar tablets, and instantly dissolve their karmic obstructions from the mysterious registers. Thus may the soul of the departed [Name], swiftly mounting the dawn, hastily depart the night. May they forever escape the scorching agonies of hell and sever all ties to the Dark Feng; may they enjoy the pure bliss of heaven and swiftly ascend the Vermilion Fire. May their steps swiftly ascend to the wondrous existence, and may their form and spirit swiftly realize the realm of emptiness.\n\nYour servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion. Respectfully presenting this memorial, he submits it with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], your servant [Your Name], prostrating himself, respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nAgain, your servant [Your Name] bows in reverence.\n\nTo the Throne,\n\nOn the [Day] of this month, your disciple [Name], in reverence, has conducted the Mystic Fast of Salvation under the Azure Mystery for several days and nights, to deliver the departed soul of [Name]. With this memorial, your servant humbly submits his report.\n\nWe reflect that when the Azure Mystery opens its court, propitious clouds ascend with the radiance of the Three Poles; when the Yellow Register establishes its palace, flying mists scatter their hues to the eight directions. The sun of wisdom shines forth from the Lion’s Throne, and the divine wind blazes in the Dragon’s script. Thus, clutching this vermilion petition, I raise this plain silk in supplication.\n\nYour servant, trembling with awe, bows his head and knocks his forehead to the ground, mindful of his fortune to ride this luminous destiny and partake in this flourishing era. Upholding the Dao and enacting heaven’s decrees, he follows in the footsteps of the exalted; receiving the mandate and proclaiming virtue, he clasps the lotus throne to attend upon your countenance. Having received the grace of nurture, how dare he not repay the blessings of cultivation?\n\nReverently considering the Most Compassionate One of the Eastern Pole, within the Palace of Eternal Joy—the Supreme Unity, Savior from Suffering, Heavenly Worthy of Jade Majesty—who sits in sublime majesty, eternally serene. Responding to thoughts with mercy, he scatters auspicious mist at the gates of death; answering cries with compassion, he showers sweet dew upon the portals of life. Universally, he delivers those sunk in darkness, all drawn to his salvific guidance.\n\nMay the departed soul swiftly depart the night and hasten into the dawn; may the dark gloom be erased from the registers, dissolving the illusory shadows of the great chiliocosm; may the Azure Florescence fix their name in the ledgers, and may they ride the true light of the Supreme Unity. Forever may they attend the Purple Gold, ascending to the heights of Jasper Jade.\n\nYour servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion. Respectfully presenting this memorial, he submits it with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], your servant [Your Name], prostrating himself, respectfully submits this *Memorial for Breaking the Prisons of Hell*.\n\nAgain, your servant [Your Name] bows in reverence.\n\nTo the August Jade Sovereign,\n\nOn the [Day] of this month, your disciple [Name], in devotion, has established the Mystic Fast of Azure Florescence and Salvific Grace, spanning several days and nights, to deliver the departed soul of [Name], now invoking the ritual forms to break the prisons of hell and summon the wandering spirit.\n\nYour servant prostrates himself, reflecting: as one ascends to the true and delivers the destined, the Azure Florescence congeals the limpid dew; as shackles are shattered and gates flung wide, auspicious mists disperse through the gloom. Daring to knock upon the sacred portal of compassion, I implore the spreading of salvific mercy. With a hundred bows I lay bare my plea, with a single heart I beseech your decree.\n\nTruly trembling in awe, I kowtow and prostrate myself, deeply concerned that in the frigid courts the lingering souls stagnate, in the abyssal ravines the forsaken spirits languish. Iron ramparts encircle them, enduring ten thousand kalpas of fettered suffering; copper gates blaze with radiance, bearing a thousand ages of carceral severity. Ghostly officials enforce the laws of yin and yang; netherworld clerks administer punishments of water and fire. Without your edict to break these bonds, how may they ascend and transcend?\n\nReverently considering the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Ultimate, within the Palace of Eternal Joy, the Greatly Compassionate One, the Supreme Unity Salvific and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy, August Jade Sovereign—ever responsive to cries, ever aiding with creation—you descend your majestic radiance upon the myriad treasures, parting the layered darkness; you wield the divine staff of the Five Numinous Ones, piercing the accumulated night. May you deign to incline your profound hearing, resplendently bestow your assent, proclaiming the decree in accord with the statutes, secretly aligning with the dragon tally to usher in the dawn; may you, following the rites, shatter the prisons, instantly bringing spring to the kennels of suffering.\n\nThus may the departed soul of [Name] depart the night without sorrow, ride the dawn with joy. As their luminous splendor blazes forth, the ninefold ramparts gleam bright; as their spirit flies with the sacred staff, the three paths know peace and prosperity. May all in the realms of suffering be uplifted together, attaining the land of bliss.\n\nYour servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion. Respectfully presenting this memorial, he submits it with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], your servant [Your Name], prostrating himself, respectfully submits this *Memorial of Merit for the Azure Florescence*.\n\nAgain, your servant [Your Name] bows in reverence.\n\nTo the August Jade Sovereign,\n\nOn the [Day] of this month, your disciple [Name], at [Location], has established the Mystic Fast of Azure Florescence and Salvific Grace, spanning several days and nights, to deliver the departed soul of [Name]. Now, with the altar rites concluded and transgressions atoned, this memorial is presented to report the merit to the divine officials, lords, generals, and clerks.\n\nYour servant prostrates himself, reflecting: as the Azure Florescence governs the celestial motions, it scatters the dew of wisdom to flow and nourish; as the Yellow Register unfurls its charts, it illumines the clouds of fortune to fly and sprinkle.\n\nThe golden tablets reveal the dragon talismans’ secrets,\nThe jade charts unfold the phoenix scriptures’ marvels.\nThe Three Realms restore life,\nThe Nine Heavens raise the dead.\nBearing radiance to succor the lowly, truly repaying grace;\nOverflowing from within, earnestly bowing in repentance.\nHumbly imploring Your profound silence,\nTo bestow pardon with boundless mercy.\n\nYour servant, trembling with awe, kowtows and prostrates himself.\nReflecting upon his own path: a minnow in the rut, a toad in the well—\nmeager talent, shallow understanding.\nFailing to uphold the Azure Precepts,\nmerely assisting in the Mystic Ranks.\nUnversed in the rites of reverence,\nhis demeanor often transgresses;\nstill ignorant of the fast’s canons,\nhe lightly violates the prohibitions.\nPresumptuously summoning the divine bureaus,\nrecklessly filing memorials under his superior’s title.\nWords disordered, yet daring to expound the golden codes;\nthoughts scattered, yet rashly inscribing jade talismans.\nHis conduct already marked by error,\nhe fears his faults and transgressions accumulate.\nEarnestly hoping for compassion,\nthat all may be forgiven with grace.\n\nReverently considering the August Jade Sovereign of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Florescence,\nthe Most High Lord of Salvation and Suffering:\nYour Dao embraces the Three Realms,\nYour virtue surpasses the Ten Splendors.\nUpholding the true spirits,\nYou reward merit with justice;\nsustaining the duties of office,\nYou conceal faults with forbearance.\n\nAt the outset of this fast’s observance,\nwe reverently summon:\nthe celestial immortals’ warrior-officers,\nthe terrestrial immortals’ mounted hosts,\nthe Perfected Ones’ cavalry,\nthe divine beings’ legions,\nthe sun, moon, and stellar constellations’ troops,\nthe Three Rivers and Four Seas’ forces,\nthe Nine Palaces and Five Thearchs’ battalions,\nthe thirty-two heavens’ overseers of the fast’s rites,\nthe jade lads attending incense,\nthe jade maidens scattering blossoms,\nthe left and right envoys of the Three-and-Five Merit Registrars,\nthe incense-officials of the Five Thearchs’ daily and hourly watches,\nthe flying-dragon riders and numinous-treasure celestial immortals,\nthe jade maidens of the inner courts of all heavens who receive offerings,\nthe merit-recording envoys of the Dao’s spiritual assemblies,\nthe left and right immortal officers of the Azure Florescence and Yellow Registers’ true bureaus,\nthe immortal generals and officers of the Nine Heavens’ Universal Salvation Court,\nthe departments of the Dark Altar’s Opening Salvation and Primordial Unity,\nthe Knot-Unbinding Bureau,\nthe Life-Monitoring Bureau,\nthe Celestial Physicians’ Bureau,\nthe Purification Bureau,\nthe Headgear-and-Case Bureau,\nthe Transformation-Summoning Bureau,\nand all their subordinate heralding officers;\nthe officers and immortals of this sanctuary’s attendant retinue,\nthe jade lads and jade maidens,\nthe principal and deputy officers, generals, and protectors of the Dao,\nthe inspectors and overseers of the altar,\nthe officials, lords, generals, and officers of all provincial courts and departments who fulfill their duties and labor in service;\nthe guardian spirits of this temple,\nthe city gods of this prefecture and this county,\nthe true officers of this village and this hamlet’s domain,\nthe earth gods and principal spirits,\nthe talisman-envoys of the Three Realms,\nthe Four Watches’ merit registrars,\nthe fast’s household earth god and Controller of Destiny,\nand the Six Spirits—\nall stand at their posts in the altar’s precincts,\neach diligent in their toil,\neach arrayed in solemn and resplendent vesture.\nAccompanying the memorial we now present,\nthey ascend to the Dark Capital,\nthere to receive their due merit and reward.\n\nHow dare we fail to inscribe this upon our hearts,\nto refine ourselves with earnest devotion,\nto strive that we may not betray the gifts of our creation,\nand to expand the nurturing power of transformation?\n\nMay we align with the primordial accord of the Dao,\nand so achieve the radiant harmony of the Eastern Florescence;\nmay we lead the teaching and study of the true,\nand so assist the alchemical transformations of the Southern Cinnabar.\n\nWith utmost reverence and overwhelming gratitude, I humbly present this memorial to make known these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial for the Water and Fire Refinement**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates and declares:\nOn the ___ day of this month, for the disciple [Name] of the fast’s law, who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights to deliver the departed soul of [Name] and ascend them to the immortal realms, we now request the descent of water and fire for refinement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate and reflect: Heaven and Earth are fixed in their positions, spreading the ancestral qi to illumine the turning cycles; Fire and Water divide their essences, exhausting their numinous power to nurture all things. The Five Scripts unfold in vastness, the myriad beings are shaped in perfection—desiring to bestow the divine radiance of the Nine Refinements, we rely wholly upon the sacred workings of the Two Modes.\n\nWith awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead, deeply concerned that the departed soul of [Name], bound by karmic dust and ingrained habits, is enmeshed in the coils of karmic filth. The root of life in the Nine Qi may seek to return to its origin, yet the stem of death in the Five Forms remains severed from the Void. Without the refining crucible to ascend on high, how may they transcend and rise directly?\n\nThe moon’s vessel gleams with radiance, drawing the golden essence of the Eastern Well; the solar mirror gathers its rays, pouring forth the vermilion fire of the Southern Cinnabar. Without the aid of such reflection, who shall assist in their manifestation?\n\nI reverently consider the Most High, formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Towers and Jade Palaces. Your Dao parallels Yin and Yang, your virtue encompasses all that is borne and covered. May you deign to issue your sacred command, sending down the luminous essence of the Five Dragons; may you dispatch the divine perfected, spreading the transformative power of the Nine Phoenixes’ resplendent harmony. Thus may the departed be restored from their bones and raised from death, and through the oversight of the true, be delivered to life.\n\nNine traversals complete the person, as qi upon qi returns to the marvel of the living spirit; ten cycles refine the being, as spirit upon spirit reveals the mystery of qi’s flow. Departing the night to face the origin, they ride the dawn and mount the light.\n\nWith utmost urgency and longing for your grace, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial to the Great Dao**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates and declares:\nOn the ___ day of this month, on behalf of the disciple [Name] of the fast, who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights to deliver the departed soul of [Name], I now present this memorial to make known these words.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate and reflect: Knocking upon the Nine Gates to serve with clarity, clouds gather in the Pure and Subtle; ascending the Eight Stairs to offer praise, winds are pure in the Dark and Mysterious. Seeking the impartial wisdom of the Three Ultimates, we receive the encompassing grace of the Ten Flowers. Rain and dew suffuse, sun and stars shine brightly—daring to take refuge in the Maple’s Lord, I pour forth the devotion of the sunflower’s heart. Earnestly I hope for your lofty brilliance to cast its illuminating gaze.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, deeply mindful that the departed soul of [Name], woven with the threads of grievance and warped in nature, is ensnared by the net of sin. The Three Delusions remain unremoved, casting them into confusion and inversion upon the lost path; the Four Bonds are unguarded, driving them to wander the crooked ways in circles. The flower of sin accumulates for ages in the Northern Feng, the leaves of transgression pile high in the records of the Eastern Tai. In the vast and desolate night abyss, the terror of water and fire strikes the heart; in the silent and cold courtyard, the sight of Yin and Yang shatters the courage. Thus we reverently establish repentance and offer this fast.\n\nWithout the boundless ocean of the Supreme Sage, how could the foolish below be nurtured in the spring of renewal?\n\nI reverently consider the Most High, formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Towers and Jade Palaces. Your majesty is beyond measure, your vastness defies description. Condensing wondrous being to bestow essence, you transform and spread across the Nine Lands; conceiving the Void to nurture purity, your governance pervades the Three Heavens. You manifest compassion for the suffering and sorrowful, broadly bestowing the grace of mercy.\n\nMay your numinous light banish the night, may the ancestral qi flourish eternally. Command the Dark Bureaus to erase the records of grievance; summon the Cinnabar Bureau to dissolve the registers of transgression. May the departed soul of [Name] depart the night in joy and ride the dawn in delight. May they transcend the Three Realms, free from the sorrow of confinement or oppression; may they be commanded to traverse the Nine Gates, blessed with the joy of escort and welcome.\n\nHow dare I not look up to the transforming sun, striving to propagate the Dao’s wind? Ascending the azure jade to lay bare my heart, I endeavor to receive the phoenix’s grace; gazing upon the purple gold to bow in homage, I forever bathe in the dragon’s favor.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial for the Blood Lake**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates...\n\nMemorial now submitted: On the ___ day of this month, for the patron ___ who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights, I have performed rites to deliver the departed soul of ___, that they may ascend to the immortal realms. It is observed that this person perished in childbirth, their form and spirit defiled by foulness, and only through the sagely creation may this be thoroughly purged. May their qi and appearance be made whole, their protective and nourishing forces restored.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself and reflect: the great virtue of ceaseless generation has long been revered for its benevolence bestowed below; with utmost care and humility, I now lay bare the sincerity of my plea. May the dark and oppressive be lifted from earthly confinement, and the mysterious and void be graced with celestial light. With reverence, I bow twice to present my petition and offer my wholehearted entreaty.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reflecting thus: by fortunate karmic affinity, I have encountered this flourishing era. To propagate the Dao and emulate Heaven, I have nearly fulfilled my duty in the dragon’s presence; to receive and proclaim virtue, I have sworn to disseminate boundless felicity. Yet I deeply consider the departed soul of ___, who, entrusted to the female condition, sought to navigate the truths of existence. Ensnared within the web of attachment, she lost the way of earth and wood; entangled in worldly mechanisms, she sullied the purity of gold and blossoms. For nine nights, she sank in the sea of suffering; in a single moment, she drowned in the Blood Lake. The jailers wielded their authority, turning in an instant to test her in the trials of yin and yang; the underworld officials displayed their might, startling her heart with the fetters of water and fire. Without the vast grace of imperial favor, how could she ascend to the transformations of yang?\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most High, formless and nameless, the void and spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Portal and Jade Palace. The Dao encompasses all in its embrace, and virtue harmonizes the hidden and the manifest. The benevolent wind stirs the eight distant realms, and all spirits rejoice; the transformative rain nourishes the nine layers, and countless souls beam with joy. May You look upon my earnest plea with favor and grant me the abundant blessings of Your grace.\n\nI humbly pray that You may issue the crane’s pardon and bestow the phoenix’s decree. May the three qi radiate their light, offering hope at dawn’s first glow; may the ten flowers illuminate the darkness, dispelling the gloom of night. Thus may the departed soul of ___ be cleansed of filth, her body and spirit filled with joy. Crossing the Crimson Mound, may she have her fate delivered and ten thousand sins dissolved in purity; may her name be erased from the Black Register, and a thousand grievances scattered in harmony. May her spirit be as jade in its purity, her steps light as spring’s warmth.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea. I, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial for the Six Canopies\nMemorial to the Mysterious Master\nThe unworthy official, [Name], bows twice.\n\nThis memorial respectfully reports: On the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple ____, a grand ___-day fast has been established to deliver the departed soul of ____, humbly beseeching the celestial grace to enable her rebirth in the realm of the living. Further, for the matter of ____, we implore the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. Tonight, we commence the fast and make this announcement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself, reflecting that the teachings emerged from the Primordial Azure, illuminating the five kalpas with divine radiance; the Dao spread across the Azure Heavens, streaming the ancestral qi to the eight directions. Who upholds the sanctity of the fast’s precepts if not the exalted authority of the master’s abode? Daring to rely upon sacred ordinance, I humbly lay bare my foolish sincerity.\n\nWith awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall that I, your servant, am blessed with felicitous foundations and born in an age of prosperity. Yet in the subtle interplay of yin and yang, I merely mingle with the luminaries of the eastern isles; in the fusion of warp and weft of the mysterious, I cannot fathom the truths of the western precincts. Presumptuously presiding over the jade altar to make offerings, I tremble at the thought of inscribing the jade tablets. I rely entirely upon your lofty wisdom to graciously extend your guiding hand.\n\nBefore the sacred presence of the Great Master of the Mysterious Realm, the Perfected Lord:\n\nEndowed with essence and subtle marvels, nurtured in the purity of the Great Void, you govern the Ten Radiant Realms, spreading the divine wind to nurture all; you preside over the Three Caverns, streaming the sun of wisdom to bring forth creation. May you, in your profound compassion, deign to descend in your swift chariot. Issue decrees and establish commands, that I may assist in the celestial order; propagate transformation and transmit the flow, that I may aid in shaping the earthly blessings. May the fast’s merit be perfected, and the imperial grace flow forth.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea. I, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Heavenly Master\nThe unworthy official, [Name], bows twice.\n\nThis memorial respectfully reports: On the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple ____, a grand ___-day fast has been established to deliver the departed soul of ____, humbly beseeching the celestial grace to enable her rebirth in the realm of the living. Further, for the matter of ____, we implore the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. Tonight, we commence the fast and make this announcement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself, reflecting that the Dragon Han unfolded the celestial charts, disseminating the sacred transformation of the Three Caverns; the Crane’s Call inaugurated the era, magnifying the divine efficacy of the One. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall that I, your servant, am blessed with felicitous foundations and born in an age of prosperity. Yet in the subtle interplay of yin and yang, I merely mingle with the luminaries of the eastern isles; in the fusion of warp and weft of the mysterious, I cannot fathom the truths of the western precincts. Presumptuously presiding over the jade altar to make offerings, I tremble at the thought of inscribing the jade tablets. I rely entirely upon your lofty wisdom to graciously extend your guiding hand.\n\nBefore the sacred presence of the Great Master of the Three Heavens, the Perfected Lord:\n\nEndowed with the purity of the Dao and the essence of qi, you embody the primal spirit. The ancestral sun shines brightly, illuminating the western lands of Shu to establish the teachings; the ancestral wind stirs, securing the right bank of the Yangtze to spread its fragrance. May you, in your profound compassion, deign to descend in your swift chariot. May the myriad Perfected receive their duties, hastening like celestial steeds through the void; may the ten poles be blessed, as dragons soar through the Yellow Chaos.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea. I, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Inspector of Fasts\nThe unworthy official, [Name], bows twice.\n\nThis memorial respectfully reports: On the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple ____, a grand ___-day fast has been established to deliver the departed soul of ____, humbly beseeching the celestial grace to enable her rebirth in the realm of the living. Further, for the matter of ____, we implore the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. Tonight, we commence the fast and make this announcement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself, reflecting that the Golden Code of the Great Crimson illumines the eight directions with radiance; the Jade Regulations of the Azure Maiden assist the Three Caverns in streaming their light. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall that I, your servant, am blessed with felicitous foundations and born in an age of prosperity. Yet in the subtle interplay of yin and yang, I merely mingle with the luminaries of the eastern isles; in the fusion of warp and weft of the mysterious, I cannot fathom the truths of the western precincts. Presumptuously presiding over the jade altar to make offerings, I tremble at the thought of inscribing the jade tablets. I rely entirely upon your lofty wisdom to graciously extend your guiding hand.\n\nBefore the sacred presence of the Great Master of the Numinous Treasure, Inspector of Fasts, the Perfected Lord:\n\nCultivating simplicity in the realm of the formless, you merge the subtle with the real. Presiding over the various bureaus, you spread divine majesty through the frost-bound registers; overseeing the multitude of offices, you uphold the sacred transformation within the cloud-borne treasuries. May you, in your profound compassion, deign to descend in your swift chariot. May your august presence be revered in every gesture, as dragons flank the imperial steps in counsel; may the ranks of officials be arrayed in solemn dignity, as the phoenixes of the court maintain order.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea. I, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Five Emperors\nThe unworthy official, [Name], bows twice.\n\nThis memorial respectfully reports: On the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple ____, a grand ___-day fast has been established to deliver the departed soul of ____, humbly beseeching the celestial grace to enable her rebirth in the realm of the living. Further, for the matter of ____, we implore the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. Tonight, we commence the fast and make this announcement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself, reflecting that the Dao covers the Ten Radiant Realms, as clouds ascend in the celestial records; the teachings spread to the eight directions, awaiting the rain’s bestowal upon the vast ordinances. Who upholds the sanctity of the fast’s precepts if not the exalted authority of the imperial abode? Daring to rely upon sacred ordinance, I humbly lay bare my foolish sincerity.\n\nWith awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall that I, your servant, am blessed with felicitous foundations and born in an age of prosperity. Yet in the subtle interplay of yin and yang, I merely mingle with the luminaries of the eastern isles; in the fusion of warp and weft of the mysterious, I cannot fathom the truths of the western precincts.

May you uphold the sixfold disciplines, displaying the net of law with thunderous authority, and govern the thousand spirits, setting the transformative mechanism in motion with rain and dew.\n\nYour servant, with utmost urgency and sincerity, respectfully presents this memorial for your august consideration.

Who upholds the sanctity of the fast’s discipline, if not for the noble guidance of the masters’ abode? Presumptuously, I lay bare my foolish sincerity. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall that I, your servant, am blessed with felicitous foundations and born in an age of prosperity. Yet in the subtle interplay of yin and yang, I merely mingle with the luminaries of the eastern isles; in the weaving of the warp and weft of the mysterious, I cannot fathom the truths of the western precincts.

Your virtue accords with the myriad wonders, and your Dao harmonizes with the Four Mysteries. Bearing the lineage of the ancestral transmission, you continue the cultivation of former sages and nurture excellence; wielding the ancestral seal, you open the path for future enlightenment and spread fragrance. May your profound compassion turn the whirlwind chariot earthward. May you ascend the eightfold steps to communicate the vermilion bonds with the celestial sphere, and anoint the multitude of spirits to uphold the mysterious rites across the four quarters.\n\nYour servant, with utmost urgency and sincerity, respectfully presents this memorial for your august consideration. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead, humbly submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your servant [Name], holding official position, respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial of Gratitude to the Six Canopies:\nMemorial to the Mysterious Master:\nYour servant [Name], with reverence, bows twice.\n\nMemorial now submitted:\n\nOn the ___ day of this month, for the ritual-purification disciple [Name], I have reverently conducted a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights. For the deliverance of the departed soul of [Name], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to enable their attainment of the realm of the living. For the supplication and exorcism concerning [Matter], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. The altar is now dissolved, and the retreat concluded.\n\nI reflect that as the sun nears its pure radiance, I have been graced to behold the dragon-borne countenance; as the Dao’s fortune unfolds across the heavens, I rejoice in following the steps of the phoenix-patterned path. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the master’s authority. With the morning rites now complete, my rustic sincerity is once more laid bare. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets. Having recklessly assumed the foremost duty of response and exaltation, I fear the severe scrutiny of the celestial records. I humbly implore your compassion and beseech your aid from above.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate before the sacred presence of the Great Master of the Three Heavens, Transformer of the Dao’s Workings:\n\nThe highest good is like water, and your great virtue is like heaven. You bear disgrace and conceal flaws, gently uplifting the ranked and illustrious; you assess merit and bestow rewards, universally recompensing the true spirits. Surely you will return in your jade chariot, swiftly ascending the jasper palace. The lush purple qi has already spread its vast grace through the celestial void; the resplendent divine radiance now bathes the mysterious ordinances across the four quarters. Your divine works shine brightly, and the sacred teachings flow unobstructed. With utmost urgency and gratitude, I respectfully present this memorial in thanksgiving. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead, humbly submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your servant [Name], holding official position, respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Heavenly Master:\nYour servant [Name], with reverence, bows twice.\n\nMemorial now submitted:\n\nOn the ___ day of this month, for the ritual-purification disciple [Name], I have reverently conducted a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights.

For the supplication and exorcism concerning [Matter], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. The altar is now dissolved, and the retreat concluded.\n\nI reflect that as the azure jade offers its sincerity, I am fortunate to bask in the light of the sacred sun; as the mysterious tablet bestows blessings, the true wind spreads its splendor. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the master’s authority. With the morning rites now complete, my rustic sincerity is once more laid bare. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets. Having recklessly assumed the foremost duty of response and exaltation, I fear the severe scrutiny of the celestial records. I humbly implore your compassion and beseech your aid from above.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate before the sacred presence of the Perfected Lord, Great Master of the Three Heavens:\n\nThe great potter’s work leaves nothing unfinished. The statutes are luminous, assessing the thousand truths to bestow rewards; the august regulations shine brightly, tracing the ranks of offices to remove transgressions. Surely you will return in your jade chariot, swiftly ascending the jasper palace. The misty vapors weave their network, universally spreading the jade grace among humankind; the colorful mists intermingle, eternally resounding the jade tones in the heavens. With utmost urgency and gratitude, I respectfully present this memorial in thanksgiving.

For the deliverance of the departed soul of [Name], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to enable their attainment of the realm of the living. For the supplication and exorcism concerning [Matter], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. The altar is now dissolved, and the retreat concluded.\n\nI reflect that as clouds gather at the nine passes, the pure ranks are arrayed for audience; as rosy mists illuminate the eight directions, the vast grace is proclaimed in completion. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the master’s authority. With the morning rites now complete, my rustic sincerity is once more laid bare. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets. Having recklessly assumed the foremost duty of response and exaltation, I fear the severe scrutiny of the celestial records. I humbly implore your compassion and beseech your aid from above.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate before the sacred presence of the Perfected Lord, Great Master of the Numinous Treasure, Leader of the Immortals, Inspector of Retreats:\n\nThe smallest good is recorded, and great virtue is embraced. Assessing merit in the cinnabar records, you elevate the divine immortals to the azure heavens; cleansing flaws in the white tablets, you uphold the ranked and illustrious in the yellow earth. Surely you will return in your jade chariot, swiftly ascending the jasper palace. Heaven is high and earth is deep, equally congealing the gracious dew to spread its radiance; yang is born and yin is perfected, universally scattering the auspicious mists to illuminate the scene. With utmost urgency and gratitude, I respectfully present this memorial in thanksgiving. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead, humbly submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your servant [Name], holding official position, respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Five Emperors:\nYour servant [Name], with reverence, bows twice.\n\nMemorial now submitted:\n\nOn the ___ day of this month, for the retreat disciple [Name], I have reverently conducted a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights. For the deliverance of the departed soul of [Name], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to enable their attainment of the realm of the living. For the supplication and exorcism concerning [Matter], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. The altar is now dissolved, and the retreat concluded.\n\nI reflect that as the sun shines upon the jade grove, the dragon and phoenix attend in majesty; as clouds envelop the jasper steps, the phoenix and egret proceed in solemn array. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the imperial authority. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets. Having recklessly assumed the foremost duty of response and exaltation, I fear the severe scrutiny of the celestial records. I humbly implore your compassion and beseech your aid from above.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate...\n\nBefore the sacred presence of the Azure Spirit, First Elder of the Nine Qi Celestial Lords; the Cinnabar Spirit, True Elder of the Three Qi Celestial Lords; the Radiant Spirit, August Elder of the Seven Qi Celestial Lords; the Five Spirits, Mystic Elder of the Five Qi Celestial Lords; and the Primordial Spirit, Prime Elder of the One Qi Celestial Lord.\n\nTheir virtue illumines the night, their harmonious qi ushers in spring. Arrayed in office and bearing the current, they expunge transgressions to fill the cinnabar registers; the myriad perfected receive their charge, inscribing meritorious deeds upon the mystic charts. Assuredly they return in jade chariots, swiftly turning toward the jasper palaces. Heaven’s radiance shines forth, at once streaming the rain of teachings to suffuse and nourish; earth’s prohibitions open in clarity, widely propagating the vast and boundless Daoist winds.\n\nI, your minister, can scarcely contain my fervent gratitude. With reverence, I present this memorial in thanksgiving.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Three Officials\n\nYour minister [Name], bowing twice, respectfully states: On the ___ day of this month, for the disciple [Name] who has reverently established the [Name] Retreat for [number] days and nights, to deliver the cloud-released souls of the deceased [Name], and humbly imploring the celestial grace to enable attainment of the living realm. Praying for expiation on behalf of [matter], beseeching protection for peace, and now concluding the altar and dispersing the retreat.\n\nI recall with humility that purple clouds arise within the forbidden precincts, traversing the golden chambers to grant audience; the dark ranks gather like rain, following the jade tablets to proclaim the decree. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the imperial authority. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets. Having recklessly assumed the foremost duty of response and exaltation, I fear the severe scrutiny of the celestial records. I humbly implore your compassion and beseech your aid from above.\n\nBefore the sacred presence of the Celestial Official of Upper Prime, Bestower of Blessings, the Radiant Primordial Yang Emperor; the Terrestrial Official of Middle Prime, Remitter of Sins, the Penetratingly Mystic and Purely Void Great Emperor; and the Aquatic Official of Lower Prime, Dispeller of Calamities, the Metallic and Mystically Dark Great Emperor.\n\nThey nurture humanity in spring’s growth, responding to all things with profound depth. Excising transgressions from the records, they subtly sustain the ranks of office; conferring honors by canonical standards, they universally elevate the thousand perfected. Assuredly they return in jade chariots, swiftly turning toward the jasper palaces. The Dao that is not the constant Dao pities the ten thousand kinds and uplifts them; the mystery upon mystery moistens the ten directions and pervades all.\n\nI, your minister, can scarcely contain my fervent gratitude. With reverence, I present this memorial in thanksgiving.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\nMemorial to the Three Masters\n\nYour minister [Name], bowing twice, respectfully states.\n\nMemorial to the Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns\n\nI humbly report that on the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple [Name], I have solemnly conducted a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights, opening the clouded paths to deliver the departed soul of [Name], that they may ascend to the blessed realms. I have also performed prayers of exorcism for [matter], beseeching peace and protection, and now conclude the retreat with the dispersal of the altar.\n\nI prostrate myself, reflecting that the Dao responds to the Purple Yang, ordering the ranks of the mysterious to assist transformation; governance unfolds in the Yellow Primal, arraying the registers of remedies to dispense grace. Fortunate is the strictness of the retreat’s discipline, which relies entirely upon the weight of the masters’ authority. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with dread that I, though unworthy, have inherited the mysterious lineage and presumptuously received its vast transformation. The statutes exalt mindfulness, yet I have failed to invoke the divine workings at the altar of mystery; the scriptures prescribe solemnity, yet my heart has not fully cultivated the cinnabar tablets. Presuming to lead the foremost office of response and proclamation, I fear incurring the severe judgments of the records. I look up, hoping for compassion, and bow down, praying for deliverance.\n\nWith reverence, I address the Masters before whom this memorial is presented: the Venerable Scripture Master of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable Register Master of the Numinous Treasure, and the Venerable Deliverance Master of the Numinous Treasure. The balance of the Water Office is just, the mirror of ice impartial. They reward the true and numinous, inscribing merit upon the azure tablets; they uphold the ranks of the manifest, excising transgressions from the mysterious registers. Assuredly they return in jade chariots, swiftly turning toward the jasper palaces. The ten thousand heavens and ten thousand earths are equally molded by the benevolence of the mysterious ultimate; the one yin and one yang together encompass the gracious blessings of the vast primal harmony. I can scarcely contain my fervent gratitude. With reverence, I present this memorial in thanksgiving.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\n**Memorial to Unveil and Communicate with the True**\n\nYour humble servant, the minor ritual officer [Name], bowing twice with awe and trepidation, knocks his forehead to the ground, and respectfully states:\n\nI prostrate myself, reflecting that the hundred thousand myriad layers of the Dao’s qi crystallize into jade-like radiance; the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures expound the teachings of the golden perfected. I look up to the crimson palaces where dragons and phoenixes ascend, and bow before the solemn ranks of the mysterious altar, where mandarin ducks and egrets stand in order. Daring to purify the bamboo slips and first set forth my sincere words, I bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation.\n\nYesterday, according to the ritual statutes, the disciple [Name] requested that a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights be solemnly conducted at [location]. To open the clouded paths and deliver the departed soul of [Name], I looked up, beseeching the celestial grace, that they might attain rebirth in the blessed realms. For the prayers of exorcism regarding [matter], I looked up, beseeching the celestial grace, to safeguard peace and protection.\n\nAs one charged with upholding the teachings, I could not justly refuse. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, I conducted the rites in proper sequence.\n\nI recall with dread that I have long relied upon the transforming light and vowed to spread the true wind. Leading the multitude of tasks, I aspired to hasten the dawn upon the forbidden paths; governing the Three Caverns, I pledged to expound the secrets from the jasper sac. Above, I sought to illuminate and turn the celestial chapters; below, to receive and proclaim the imperial mandate. Arraying the eight terraces, I mirrored the nine heavens. Behold the terrace of the Three Flowers, towering through kalpas, wreathed in purple mist; gaze upon the gate of the Seven Treasures, vast and sunlit, veiled in rosy clouds. Without ascending by jade decree, how could one approach the golden chambers and present memorials?\n\nWith reverence, I address the Most High, Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Utmost True and Great Dao, the Supreme Primordial August One before the Golden Gates and Jade Steps. Your divine work is not self-willed; your sagely transformation knows no bounds. The azure vault resounds with empty song, illuminating the five patterns and expanding the vast; the purple void flourishes in luxuriance, dividing the three luminaries to bring forth clarity. Lofty and ever loftier, you ascend beyond all ascent.\n\nI pray that you may extend your favor at the phoenix throne and permit direct approach to the dragon [seat]. May the assembly celebrate the winds and clouds, as the ten poles gather the radiance of the numinous light; may your beneficent rain and dew shine forth, as the eight distances receive the splendor of the ancestral qi. Far and near, all receive your grace; the hidden and the manifest are bathed in your blessings. May your influence flow unceasingly through the kalpas, that I may forever support and revere the mysterious origin.\n\nI can scarcely contain my longing as I gaze toward the heavens and yearn for the sagely presence. With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\n**The Supreme Memorials of the Three Caverns, First Scroll, Concludes**\n\n**The Supreme Memorials of the Three Caverns, Second Scroll**\n\n**Memorial to Break Open Fengdu and Initiate the Dao’s Work**\n\nYour minister [Name], bowing twice with awe and trepidation, knocks his forehead to the ground, and respectfully states:\n\nI am but a worthless timber, a humble reed, fortunate by past blessings to be recklessly attached to the ranks of the true. My merits are not even as round as a grain of millet, while my transgressions accumulate like mountains and abysses. By your gracious forbearance, I have not been condemned to destruction. I vow to exert myself in cultivation, striving to repay your kindness. Having received this petition, how dare I not report it?\n\nI reverently consider the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Six Caverns and Ten Palaces, the dark passes and shadowy nights, the trials by water and fire, the bonds of life and death. Enduring bitterness through the ages, they revolve through a thousand kalpas. Though the deluded karma of sentient beings is self-inflicted, the benevolent grace of the Supreme Mystery is worthy of compassion. Without relying upon pardon and absolution, how could they attain transcendence?\n\nI humbly present a memorial, praying that it may ascend to the Three Heavens. I hope that your compassion may incline toward mercy, and that you may specially bestow the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the ten directions and brightening the nine ramparts. May the departed [Name], together with their nine ancestors and seven generations, their kindred through countless kalpas, the six paths and four births, and all classes of hidden souls, be bathed in the wondrous qi, suddenly awaken to their true hearts, and have their karmic debts from past kalpas instantly dissolved.\n\nI respectfully invoke the Flying Celestial Messengers of the Ten Directions and the Jade Boys and Girls who deliver from suffering, to ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps before the Three Heavens, and request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s decrees, the golden registers, the white tablets, and the true talismans of deliverance. May these be proclaimed to the Three Realms of the Ten Directions, the boundless divine realms, the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the yin and yang records of transgressions, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the hundred and twenty courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the inner and outer palace caverns, the Avīci Hell and the Uninterrupted, the great and small Iron Enclosures, the twelve river sources, the Yellow Springs, the nine dark realms and five marchmounts, the lords of sin and punishment, the five sufferings and three paths, all the great hells, the Five Paths’ capital bureaus, and the underworld offices of enforcement.\n\nBy the radiance of these talismans, may the iron cities be illuminated, the torments of suffering shattered, the cangues and fetters removed, the imprisoned freed, and the furnaces and coals abolished.\n\nMay the bronze pillars transform into towering forests. May the cauldrons of boiling liquid become icy pools, all turning into lotus ponds. May the ash rivers and searing coals alike turn cool and refreshing. May the mountains of swords and halberds become groves of jeweled trees. May the blazing infernos of flame be extinguished, and the layered adamantine mountains melt away. May all judgments be suspended and equitably resolved, grievances and enmities reconciled. May the roots of evil be severed and expunged, the records of sin obliterated. May pardon be granted to the departed, to so-and-so, extending boundlessly to all lost souls in the hidden darkness—those imprisoned and suffering in torment—so that all may attain freedom and ease. May the sunken spirits and submerged souls each find liberation.\n\nFurthermore, we humbly beseech the sagacious decree to command the Azure Palace, to open the jade casket of the Purple Yang, and to reveal the sacred name of the Compassionate One of Transformative Response. May the Dao flow throughout the Ten Directions, and may all beings return to refuge. May the gates of the Dharma be flung wide, and may the burdened households be swiftly delivered. Thus may the blessings of good affinity pour forth like rain, the divine favors spread abundantly, and all equally bathe in the grace of creation, serving as proof of efficacy.\n\nBy the boundless virtue of the Great Dao, we distinguish ourselves to implore mercy. Your humble servant, acting through the Direct Envoys of the Two Offices, the Left and Right Official Messengers of the Orthodox Unity Merit Bureaus, the yin-yang divine seal clerks, the chariot-red talisman clerks, the just-wind courier clerks, the post-horse memorial clerks, the flying-dragon riders, the memorial-presenting phoenix riders, the cloud-dragon memorial riders, the wind-borne memorial riders, the divine-dragon memorial riders, and the flying-dragon and flying-tiger memorial riders—each dispatched in pairs—now, on behalf of the patron so-and-so, respectfully presents this memorial, ascending to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. We prostrate ourselves in hope that the celestial grace may respond.\n\nWith utmost reverence and awe, we bow our heads to the ground, kowtowing again and again, to make this known.\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\nYour subject, of the surname [X], from [X] Prefecture, [X] County, [X] Township, [X] Palace-Observatory, [X] Oratory, respectfully engages in purification and cultivation.\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\nThe Most High is formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Mysterious Honored One, before the Golden Portals and Seven-Jewel Jade Steps.\n\n**[Three blank lines]**\nYear [X], month [X], day [X], at [X] place, respectfully presented.\n\nTo the right: For all memorials, use yellow paper inscribed in vermilion.

The title strip shall be one foot and two inches in length, one inch and eight fen in width, bound thrice with azure silk thread. Seal the cross-knot and both ends with paper stamps. Place it within an azure paper title strip, written in the same manner as the outer strip. Wrap the front and back with cloth—such is the method for sealing memorials.\n\n**Memorial for the Plain Chariot and White Horse**\n\n**[Official position]** Your subject [X], with utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, kowtowing again and again, submits this memorial:\n\nYour subject is by nature careless and stubborn, endowed with foolish dullness. Though unworthily entrusted with the office of salvation, I dare not neglect my duty to report. Humbly I implore the lofty Perfected Ones to graciously pardon my presumption.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of the retreat, and as my office requires me to oversee the teachings, I cannot in good conscience refuse. Thus, I respectfully choose this [X] day of the present month to begin at [X] place, solemnly establishing a numinous altar, proceeding in accordance with the true statutes, and conducting the rites in proper sequence.\n\nYour subject earnestly considers that the Nine Dark Realms, Six Caverns, Three Offices of Fengdu, and the shadowy passes of the underworld are charged with examination and judgment. Without the proclamation of the vast heavens, how can the guardians of form and soul be commanded?\n\nI respectfully present one memorial, ascending to the Three Heavenly Bureaus. Humbly I hope that compassion may incline to mercy, that the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the Numinous Treasure’s wondrous light may shine upon the yin realms and illumine the nightly courts. May the deceased [X], together with the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages of forebears, the myriad kalpas of karmic kin, the six paths of rebirth, the four modes of birth, and all classes of wandering souls, be spared from sinking into suffering, each freed from their bonds, and come before the numinous altar to attain ranks and ascend in deliverance.\n\nYour subject respectfully invokes:\n- The Twelve Generals of the Plain Chariot and White Horse, with 120 officers and generals;\n- The Twelve Envoys of the Nine-Dragon Talismanic Mandate, with 120 officers and generals;\n- The Twelve Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery, with 120 officers and generals;\n- The Twelve Direct Envoys of the Supreme Mystery, with 120 officers and generals.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Portals and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens, and beseech the Most High to issue a divine amnesty and celestial register, proclaiming it to the ten directions and three realms, the boundless divine realms, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the subterranean courts, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the hundred and twenty departments, the inner and outer palaces and caverns of water and fire, yin and yang, the thirty-six hells, the Avīci and other unrelenting hells, the great and small Iron Enclosures, the fiery pools and watery marshes, the four rivers and five peaks, the twelve river sources, the Five Thearchs’ Examiners, the officials of the six palaces, the mighty heavenly warriors, the divine soldiers who execute punishments, those who oversee killing and merit, recording and destiny, examining and sentencing, prisons and transgressions, the Four Luminaries and the Lords of the Heavenly Gates, the wardens of the ten courts and six caverns, the Five Thearchs and Great Demons, the mighty spirits of the dark depths, the Five Paths’ capital bureaus, the underworld’s officials, the long-night ghostly officers, and the innumerable yin courts—all shall be commanded to know and comply.\n\nAt the place where the altar is now established, may they issue talismanic mandates, provide escort and reception, and swiftly cause the aforementioned departed souls to have their manifold sufferings swept away, to escape the earthly prisons, to bid eternal farewell to the dark night, to behold the light, to have their black registers burned and their karmic roots scattered, to attend the numinous throne, to receive transformation and rebirth, as proof of efficacy.\n\nWith hope that the Great Dao may distinguish and respond to this plea.\n\nThe humble servant, in all reverence, invokes the messengers of the Two Offices, the left and right envoys of the Orthodox Unity Merit Clerks, the yin-yang spirit-decision officers, the chariot-red-talisman officers, the fierce-wind courier officers, the post-horse memorial officers, the flying-dragon riders, the memorial-presenting phoenix riders, the cloud-dragon memorial riders, the wind-dispatched memorial riders, the divine-dragon memorial riders, and the flying-dragon and flying-tiger memorial riders—each to dispatch two attendants.\n\nThis servant, on behalf of the altar master [Name], respectfully presents this memorial, to be delivered to the Three Heavenly Courts. May the celestial grace deign to respond.\n\nWith utmost trepidation and awe, the servant bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this plea.\n\n[Three blank lines]\nThe servant, [Name], of [State, County, Village, Temple, and Retreat], humbly conducts this rite of burning and cultivation.\n[Three blank lines]\nThe Most High, formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao of Non-Being, the Supreme Mystery, the August Jade Sovereign of the Seven Jeweled Golden Palace.\n[Three blank lines]\nOn the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], respectfully presented at [Location].\n\n**Memorial for Opening the Roads**\n\nThe humble servant [Name], in awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this plea:\n\nThis servant, dull and benighted by nature, presumptuously holds a position in the Mysterious Ranks, indebted to the vast favor bestowed. Daring to exhaust repeated supplications, I humbly express even a fraction of my sincerity.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of the retreat, this servant’s duty is to uphold the teachings, and the principle forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [Day] of this month, I reverently establish a Mysterious Altar at [Location], proceeding in strict accordance with the true precepts.\n\nThis servant deeply fears that the departed souls, with their wandering consciousness, may encounter obstacles and hindrances along the roads and passes they traverse. Without the august decree of the Supreme Mystery, how could the pathways be opened?\n\nI respectfully present this memorial to the Three Heavens. May compassion incline to mercy, and may the Jade Clarity’s Dao-qi and the Numinous Treasure’s wondrous light illuminate the dark paths, radiating boundless brilliance. May the deceased [Name], together with the nine ancestral generations, the seven lineages, the karmic kin of countless kalpas, the six destinies and four births, and all categories of yin spirits, swiftly depart their respective domains to attend the altar, have their sins absolved, the dark realms unsealed, and receive refinement in the presence of the Perfected.\n\nThis servant respectfully invokes the Great Mystery’s Direct Talisman Envoys, the Supreme Unity Messengers, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talisman Ten Heavenly Heralds, the Xuan Capital’s Golden Dragon and Reedy Dragon Couriers, and the Jade Dragon and Flying Dragon Couriers—each twelve in number, accompanied by one hundred twenty officials and generals—to ascend to the Jade Palace of the Three Heavens’ Golden Portals. May they request the descent of the Eastern Florescence Azure Palace’s Nine Dragon Talismanic Mandate, the Purple Yang Treasure Seal, the Five Directions’ Life-Qi Ten Heavenly Treasure Talismans, to illumine the yin darkness, dispel the long night, and proclaim to the Heavenly Prisons, Earthly Hells, Watery Yin Courts, Underworld Bureaus, Earthly Magistrates, the Six Paths’ Springs and Nine Mounds, the Three Offices and Nine Netherworlds, the Five Peaks and Ten Palaces, the Earth Gods of the Nine Provinces, the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands, the Judgment Halls’ officials, the Elder of the Grave Mounds, the Mound Lords and Tomb Wardens, the River Lords and River Clerks, the Earthly Officials, the Year Virtue Deities, the Mountain Forest Elders, the Springs and Streams, the Dark Passes of the Underworld, the Blood-Offering Deities, the City Gods and Village Earth Gods, the Temple Earth Gods—all governing authorities.\n\nMay they all receive the Heavenly Talismans, comply with the proclamations, absolve grievances and remove sins, open the roads and unseal the gates, release the aforementioned departed souls, array their forms in order, proceed through the ranks, and come before the altar to hear the Dharma, attend the Perfected, receive the precepts and talismans, and partake in the merit and virtue.\n\nMay the dark night no longer traverse perilous obstacles, and may the netherworld passes swiftly yield to freedom. May the summons be unhindered, and the talismans serve as proof of efficacy.\n\nWith hope that the Great Dao may distinguish and respond to this plea.\n\nThis humble servant, in utmost reverence, respectfully submits this. I prostrate myself to make this known.\n\n[Blank line]\n[Official title, sacred rank, date—all as per previous format]\n\n**Memorial for Summoning the Departed Souls**\n\nThe humble servant [Name], in awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully addresses this plea:\n\nThis servant, ignorant and dull, has presumptuously expounded the luminous precepts and upheld the wondrous transformation. Daring to intrude upon the august majesty of the Sacred, I offer this humble and pitiable entreaty. Relying entirely upon compassionate regard, may it receive sagely consideration.\n\nThe humble servant, in accordance with the intent of the purification rites and the duties of his office, finds it impossible to refuse or disobey. Thus, beginning on the [day] of [month], he respectfully establishes a sacred altar at [location], meticulously following the true precepts and proceeding in due order.\n\nThis servant deeply fears that the paths of the netherworld are vast and desolate, its dark roads bleak and bewildering. Without the awe-inspiring power of summoning and gathering, how could the governance of the Divine Tiger be made manifest? Reverently adhering to the *Taiyi Divine Tiger Secret Method*, he invokes the *Taiyi Mysterious Darkness*, the *Jade Talisman Divine Tiger*, the *Talismanic Command of Iron Traces*, the *Terrace Light Treasure Chapters*, and erects the *Divine Tiger Summoning Altar*. At the appointed hour, he issues the decree to pursue and gather the departed soul of [Name], along with the nine ancestral generations, seven forebears, karmic kin of countless kalpas, and all wandering spirits of the six paths and four births, that they may be visibly received by their living kin and their divine forms made manifest.\n\nRespectfully, a memorial is presented to ascend to the Three Heavens. It is humbly hoped that compassion may bend downward, mercy be specially bestowed, the *qi* of the Jade Clarity Dao, the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, may illuminate the dark barriers without hindrance. May the *Jade Talisman Commands* shine with radiant splendor, and the nether officials and underworld bureaus reverently heed and obey.\n\nThis servant respectfully invokes:\nThe *Northern Culmen Mysterious Model Divine Tiger Inner True Mighty Left Great Force Commander of the Hundred Nodes and Three Hun*,\nThe *Multitudinous Mechanism Jade Bureau Mysterious Elder Feminine Right Martial Simurgh Seizer of Hun and Gatherer of Po, Inverter of Life Dark Bureau Flying Talisman Jade Talisman Master Official*,\nThe *Upper Division Pursuing Hun Envoys*, *Middle Division Pursuing Hun Envoys*, *Lower Division Pursuing Hun Envoys*, to pursue the three hun of the seven ancestral forebears.\nThe *Upper Primordial Jade Maidens*, to pursue the souls of those who died from leprosy, convulsions, epilepsy, parasitic infestations, dysentery, miasmic fevers, and malarial chills.\nThe *Middle Primordial Jade Maidens*, to pursue the souls of those who died from consumption, exhaustion, paralysis, and other unclaimed afflictions.\nThe *Lower Primordial Jade Maidens*, to pursue the souls of those who died from pestilence, thunderous wrath, and other calamities.\nThe *Jade Talisman Jade Maidens*, to pursue the souls of those who died from fright, hanging, blade execution, suicide by drowning, fire, childbirth, or defilement.\nThe *Tortoise Terrace Pure Grasp Jade Maidens*, to pursue the souls of those who died from poison, curses, demonic possession, incantations, warfare, banditry, royal punishment, or harm by beasts.\nThe *Nine Numinous Dark Terrace Jade Maidens*, to pursue the imprisoned sinful souls.\nThe *Orthodox Unity Prolonger of Life*, *Six Jia Hidden Heaven*, and *Numinous Talisman Jade Maidens*, to swiftly arrive, receive the talismanic command, proclaim virtue, and gather the po and summon the hun.\n\nFurthermore, this servant respectfully invokes:\nThe *Great General of the Left Guard of the Cinnabar Heaven*,\nThe *Divine Lads Who Open the Dao of the Five Directions*,\nThe *Dao Masters of the Ten Directions*,\nThe *Meritorious Officials of the Six Paths*,\nThe *Pursuing Hun Envoys of the Three Realms*,\nThe *Celestial Perfected of the Heavenly Caverns*, pure and clear,\nTo seek the hun, gather the po, face the soul, and assemble the hun.\nMay all the great generals descend as one.\n\nFor the purpose of this servant’s summoning of the aforementioned departed souls, may they gather their spirits and restore their *qi*, return to the realm of the living, ascend the banner and manifest their forms, communicate through dreams, and make their presence known. May this above exalt the transformation of the Dao and below console the grief of the bereaved. May they receive refinement and bear the talismans, hear the sutras, and listen to the Dharma. May their sins be erased from the records of the Northern Gloom and their true names inscribed in the Southern Cinnabar. May their timely ascent serve as proof of efficacy.\n\nWith hope that...\n\nGreat Dao, we humbly beseech Your compassion.\n\nYour foolish servant, with utmost reverence, bows twice to present this petition. Following the established rites, we proceed with the *Muyu Yizhi Zhang* (Chapter of Bathing and Healing).\n\nThe humble servant [Name], holding this office, prostrates in awe and trepidation, kowtowing repeatedly to address this: I, a being of dust and leakage, a mere ant-like existence, dare to presume upon the ranks of those who proclaim virtue and hesitate not to undertake the canon of saving souls. May Your majestic presence, resplendent and awe-inspiring, deign to heed this plea.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty is to uphold the teachings, and reason forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this [month], I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding step by step in accordance with the true precepts.\n\nI deeply fear that the aforementioned departed souls, confined in the gloom of the nether gates, are enmeshed in the filth of yin. To achieve the clarity of their forms, they must rely on the purifying flow of divine springs. Therefore, I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, hoping for Your merciful descent. May the *qi* of the Jade Purity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure suffuse the Orchid Pool, bathing them in radiant splendor.\n\nMay the departed, [Name], along with their nine ancestral generations, seven forebears, countless karmic kin, and all beings of the six paths and four modes of birth—every shade in the hidden realms—be cleansed of miasmic obstructions, their forms and spirits purified, inner and outer realms made luminous, and not a speck of dust remaining.\n\nI humbly invoke the descent of:\n- The Jade Maiden of the Eastern Well and the Lady of the Hua Pond,\n- The Jade Maidens of Washing and Bathing, and the Lords of the Bathing Rites,\n- The Moon and Sun Lads, one each,\n- The Officers and Generals of the Five Directions for Dispelling Filth, 120 each.\n\nMay they unite and descend. Through divine transformation, may the Yellow Flower Pool of the Eastern Well and the Flowing Marsh of the Western Fields yield the sacred water of Stone Essence and Yellow Flower, the *qi* of the Five Directions, the essence of the sun and moon, the Golden Nectar of Sweet Dew, and the Cloud Fat and Jade Elixir. May these bathe the departed souls, refining their sinful dust and washing away their hindering filth. May the impurities of their knots and fetters be cleansed, and the karmic debts and afflictions of their grievances be purified.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Green Spirit Elder of the East, who nourishes with the green nectar of nine *qi*,\n- The Cinnabar Spirit Elder of the South, who nourishes with the cinnabar splendor of three *qi*,\n- The Radiant Spirit Elder of the West, who nourishes with the white pulp of seven *qi*,\n- The Dark Spirit Elder of the North, who nourishes with the dark sap of five *qi*,\n- The Yellow Spirit Elder of the Center, who nourishes with the yellow essence of one *qi*.\n\nMay they stabilize the *po* and pacify the *hun*, naturally generating the five viscera.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Vajra of a Hundred Refinements,\n- The Jade Liquid of a Thousand Harmonies,\n- The Flowing Light of Venus,\n- The Scattered Essence of the Primordial Sovereign.\n\nMay they dispel oppressive afflictions, purge turbid filth, and render body and mind pure, wisdom luminous and penetrating.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Divine Physicians of Heaven,\n- The Numinous Officers of Medicinal Arts,\n- The Three and Five Merit Officials,\n- The Grand Masters of Medicine,\n- The Acupuncture and Stone Needle Officers,\n- The Numinous Officers of Medicinal Application.\n\nMay they secretly administer the nine-transformed magic mushrooms and five-colored divine medicines, dispersing them through the meridians and viscera to heal the ailments of their former lives’ *ying* and *wei*. May the aforementioned departed souls find their chronic illnesses pacified, deep-seated maladies cured, spirits restored, limbs purified, and receive transformation for rebirth as proof of efficacy.\n\nGreat Dao, we humbly beseech Your compassion.\nYour foolish servant, with utmost reverence, bows twice to present this petition. Following the established rites, we conclude with the *Pudu Youhun Zhang* (Chapter for the Universal Salvation of Hidden Souls).\n\nThe humble servant [Name], holding this office, prostrates in awe and trepidation, kowtowing repeatedly to address this: Though I am unworthy to stand among the ranks of the true, I strive to aid the transformation of the Dao, pledging my heart to uphold the teachings and dedicating myself to saving souls. I presume upon Your august authority, offering these humble words, though they are but a drop in the vast ocean of beings.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty is to uphold the teachings, and reason forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this month, I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding step by step in accordance with the rites.\n\nI have witnessed the hidden paths of the nether gates, where lost souls and trapped spirits linger. Some were swept away by water or fire, others slain by weapons or treachery, crushed by trees or stones, or wounded by blades or punishments. Some suffered long from hunger and cold, or were poisoned by toxins; others were killed by bandits, devoured by snakes or tigers, executed by law, or struck by thunder. Some perished in overturned carts or fallen horses, hanged themselves, or drowned in rivers; others died in foreign lands, fell in battle, or were seized by ghosts and spirits. Some were bound by karmic grievances, or afflicted with muteness, lameness, deafness, or plagues; others died in childbirth, from illness, or by untimely fate. Some bore ancient resentments or constant sorrows, or were never freed by imperial grace or general amnesties. Countless names remain solitary and stagnant, myriad families sunk in suffering. They dwell as shadows in forests or hide as phantoms in the wilds, wandering without refuge, truly pitiable.\n\nOnly the Yellow Register reveals the grace of the Leaking Spring; the Gate of True Yin offers the moment to plead for their salvation. Though I have received the Jade Talismans and presumed upon the great amnesty, I fear my merits have not reached the hidden realms. Therefore, I follow the Dao of the Immeasurable Salvation of Beings. On the night of the [day] of this month, I shall prepare the grand offering of the Jade Mountain Pure Feast in the Mysterious Capital, summoning the departed of the nine provinces and ten realms, the six paths and four modes of birth—all manner of the injured and deceased, boundless shades and consciousnesses—to partake of the feast, receive refinement, and transcend suffering for rebirth.\n\nWithout the compassion of the Great Dao, how could these souls attain liberation? I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, hoping for Your merciful descent. May the *qi* of the Jade Purity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure fill the ten directions, illuminating the nine wilds, reaching infinitely above and below. May they guide all beings to the Dharma banquet, where sins are washed away, grievances dissolved, and forms refined for transformation.\n\nI humbly invoke:\n- The Great Brahma Numinous Officers of the Jade Purity’s Vast Expanse,\n- The Salvific Numinous Officers of the Azure Mystery and Yellow Register,\n- The Merit Officials, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens, thirty-two each,\n- The Immortal Clerks, one hundred in number.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens to request the descent of the Primordial Sovereign’s merciful and auspicious Sweet Dew, bearing the Banner of Heavenly Compassion and Amnesty. May they unite and descend, reciting incantations to sprinkle the Sweet Dew, universally transforming the feast’s measures, pervading empty space without end. May all shades be nourished and sated, their hunger and thirst fulfilled, responding to the call to drink and be fully satisfied.\n\nInvoking the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, the Golden Register’s White Tablet, the True Talismans of Salvation from Suffering and Eternal Life, the Precious Register of the Most High for Ascending to Heaven, the Nine-Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Flowery Azure Palace—may their radiant nets of light deliver and uplift those sunk in darkness, without distinction among the Six Paths and Four Modes of Birth, all receiving the refining alchemy of the Yellow Register. Thus, those not yet delivered shall be delivered; those delivered but not yet born, born; those born but not yet ascended, ascended; those ascended but not yet transformed, transformed. May the talismans unite and the contracts be fulfilled, returning yin to yang, transcending both human and celestial realms as proof of efficacy.\n\nWith grace, I beseech the Great Dao, distinguishing my plea in sorrow.\n\nYour humble servant, bowing again and again, respectfully submits this entreaty.\n\n[Blank space for ritual conclusion, as before]\n*Ninefold Refinement for Ascending Immortality and Delivering the Departed*\n\nYour subordinate, [Name], in utmost reverence and awe, prostrates repeatedly, bowing twice to present this memorial:\n\nMy Dao remains unpenetrated, my virtue far from the subtle. Often have I petitioned on behalf of others, each time trembling with self-reproach. I humbly rely on your boundless magnanimity and implore your pardon.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty is to uphold the teachings, and principle forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this month, I shall reverently establish a numinous altar at [location] and proceed with the rites in proper sequence.\n\nI deeply fear that these departed souls, long mired in yin’s darkness, are easily severed from yang’s light. Without the refining alchemy of the Yellow Flower, how may they ascend to the Azure Vault and attain perfection? Therefore, on the night of [day], I shall faithfully adhere to the *Lingbao* Great Rites, the *Measureless Deliverance of Beings*, unfolding the Five Scripts and performing the Ninefold Refinement. First, I present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens.\n\nI humbly pray that your compassion may descend, granting special mercy to send forth the Dao-qi of Jade Purity and the wondrous radiance of *Lingbao*, suffusing the numinous altar, brandishing luminous brilliance. May these departed souls bathe in the numinous light, their hearts cleansed of yin’s filth, their forms refined by water and fire, their inner and outer selves made whole.\n\nI respectfully invoke:\n- The Venerable Immortal of the Southern Palace who Delivers from Death,\n- The Great Lord of Eternal Life of the Southern Culmen,\n- The Marshal Deity of Salvation,\n- The Benevolent Lord Han of Life-Prolonging,\n- The Venerable Deities of the Southern Office of Life and Record, who extend lifespan and augment destiny,\n- The Measureless Deliverer of the Dead, True Lord of Resurrecting Bones,\n- The True Lord of the Southern Palace who Delivers Souls to Ascend.\n\nMay they inscribe the departed [Name]’s destiny in golden script and fix their name upon the Jade Tablet.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Immortal Clerks of the Great Unity’s Salvation from Suffering,\n- The Immortal Clerks of the Golden Gates’ Transformative Manifestations,\n- The Immortal Clerks of the Vermilion Mound’s Life-Deliverance,\n- The Immortal Clerks of Carefree Joy,\n- The Immortal Clerks of Precious Flowery Perfection,\n- The *Lingbao* Immortal Officials of the Jade Bureau of Refinement and Deliverance,\n- The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens,\n- The Generals and Envoys,\n- The Merit Officials and Chief Clerks.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens to request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, the Golden Register’s White Tablet, the Talisman of Eternal Life, the Jade Characters of Inner Sound, the Vermilion Script of True Writ, and the Precious Proclamation of the Yellow Register for Ascending Birth. May these descend upon the altar, delivering the departed [Name] from the filth of Fengdu and the yin gloom of the Yellow Springs. May their karmic roots be severed, their sinful records burned, the Five Portals flown past, the Three Corpses severed. May the Dharma Bridge be erected, the cloud realms traversed. May the Precious Well of the Yellow Flower be opened, the divine court of Flowing Fire established. May yang’s numen be refined, yin’s shadows dispelled, ascending to the Vermilion Palace, entering the Realm of Radiant Light, restoring the myriad spirits and regenerating the Nine Qi. Clad in the vestments of celestial ascent, riding the precious chariot of lotus, may they proceed directly to the Heavenly Gates, pay homage at the Golden Gates, roam freely and at ease, uniting with the Dao in perfection. Forever freed from the sorrow of rebirth, ever treading the path of luminous fortune, may they swiftly attain deliverance and soon join the ranks of heaven and humanity.\n\nWith grace, I beseech the Great Dao, distinguishing my plea in sorrow.\n\nYour humble servant, bowing again and again, respectfully submits this entreaty.\n\n[Blank space for ritual conclusion, as before]\n*Memorial for Pardoning Sins in Fengdu*\n\nYour subordinate, [Name], in utmost reverence and awe, prostrates and bows repeatedly to present this memorial:\n\nBorn in this defiled world, I have encountered an era of flourishing fortune, received the registers to partake in the mysteries, transmitted the scriptures, and awakened to the Dao. I have vowed to deliver beings and uphold the teachings, striving to atone for faults and establish merit. How dare I neglect supplication for those who take refuge?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, I deeply consider the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Courts, Six Caves, Ten Palaces, Thirty-Six Prisons, the Boundless Iron Enclosure, the Yellow Springs’ winding depths, the Five Sufferings, Three Evil Paths, Nine Yin Realms, and Five Marchmounts—all who govern the laws and examine transgressions. The foolish masses, ignorant of right principle, accumulate karmic debts and indulge in wrongdoing. Thus, their names are bound to the Northern Fengdu, their souls confined to the dark night, imprisoned in yin’s dungeons, fettered for eternity, enduring every torment, with no means of liberation. Without the mysterious pardon of the void, how may their retribution be absolved?\n\nI respectfully present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens.\n\nProstrate, I beseech the great virtue of boundless life and the all-encompassing benevolence to specially bestow the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of Numinous Treasure, illuminating the ten directions and brightening the three realms. May the dark gates and shadowed paths be suffused with radiant splendor, and the earth-bound sinful souls be instantly purified. Thus may the aforementioned departed spirits emerge from the abyssal night, swiftly behold the morning sun, awaken their suffering hearts, recognize their past lives, repent their transgressions, and advance in goodness, casting off torment to transcend into new life.\n\nI reverently petition for the descent of the Talisman-Officer for Summoning Spirits and the Divine Youth for Summoning Spirits, each one, to specially invoke for the deceased [Name]. I present the Supreme Ultimate True Talisman and proclaim it to the Eastern Ultimate, within the Palace of Eternal Joy, to the Great Compassionate One, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Salvation Who Responds to Cries, beseeching the descent of mighty divine wisdom-light to universally illuminate the ten-directional worlds. May the deepest yin’s layered prisons and the Northern Capital’s frigid pools—every dungeon within—be transformed into yang realms.\n\n**Ninefold Refinement for Ascending Immortals and Delivering Souls Memorial**\nYour subordinate [Name], trembling with awe, bows his head repeatedly and respectfully addresses: My Dao remains unconnected to the mysterious, my virtue far from the wondrous. Though I repeatedly make petitions for others, I ever chasten myself with trepidation. Looking upward, I rely on boundless grace; gazing downward, I implore lenient pardon.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a teacher forbids refusal. Beginning on the [Day] of this month, I reverently establish a sacred altar at [Location] and proceed with the rites in due order. I deeply consider that the aforementioned departed souls, long submerged in yin’s darkness, are easily severed from yang’s light. Without the refining power of the Yellow Flower, how may they ascend to the Azure Heavens and attain perfection?\n\nOn the night of [Day], I shall faithfully follow the Numinous Treasure’s Great Dharma of Limitless Salvation, unfolding the Five Scriptures and performing the Ninefold Refinement. First, I present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens. Prostrate, I beseech compassion to condescend and specially bestow the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of Numinous Treasure, pouring into the sacred altar and radiating luminous brilliance. Thus may the aforementioned departed souls bathe their bodies in divine light, cleanse their hearts of yin’s filth, refine their essences through water and fire, and perfect their inner and outer selves.\n\nI reverently petition the Southern Palace’s Heavenly Worthy of Delivering the Dead, the Southern Ultimate’s Great Lord of Longevity, the Marshal of Salvation, the Benevolent Lord Han, the Southern Superintendents of Life and Records, the Heavenly Worthies of Prolonging Life and Dispelling Calamities, the Boundless Deliverer of the Dead Who Restores Bones, and the Heavenly Lord of Delivering Souls to Ascend the Southern Palace, to inscribe the deceased [Name]’s lifespan in golden script and fix their name upon the jade tablet.\n\nFurther, I petition the Heavenly Worthy’s Salvation Officers, the Golden Palace’s Transformation Officers, the Vermilion Mound’s Life-Delivering Officers, the Carefree and Joyous Officers, the Officers of Perfect Treasure Blossom, the Numinous Treasure Officers of the Jade Bureau of Refinement and Salvation, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Generals, Envoys, and Merit-Officials to ascend to the Golden Palace of the Three Heavens and request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, the Golden Register’s White Tablet, the Longevity Talisman, the Inner Sound’s Jade Characters, the Vermilion Script’s True Text, and the Yellow Register’s Treasure Proclamation of Ascension. May these descend to the altar, purifying the deceased [Name] by breaking the foulness of Fengdu and sweeping away the yin’s gloom of the Yellow Springs. May their karmic roots be severed, their sinful records burned, the Five Households flown beyond, and the Three Corpses slain. May the Dharma Bridge be erected, the cloud realms traversed. May the Well of Yellow Flower be opened, the divine court of flowing fire established. May yang’s spirits be refined, yin’s shadows dispelled, ascending to the Vermilion Palace and descending into the Realm of Radiance, restoring the myriad spirits and regenerating the Nine Qi. Clad in the vestments of celestial ascent, riding the lotus chariot, may they proceed directly to the Heavenly Gate, pay homage at the Golden Palace, roam freely and at ease, and merge with the Dao in perfection. Forever free from the sorrow of rebirth, may they ever tread the path of luminous fortune. May they swiftly attain deliverance and soon join the ranks of heaven and humanity. By the grace of the Great Dao, I humbly plead for distinction and mercy.\n\nI, your foolish subordinate, bow twice more in reverence to inform the Three Heavens.\n\n**Fengdu Pardon of Sins Memorial**\nYour subordinate [Name], trembling with awe, bows his head repeatedly and respectfully addresses: Born in this impure world, I live in an era of flourishing destiny, bearing registers and delving into the mysterious, transmitting scriptures and awakening to the Dao. I vowed to deliver others and lead the teachings, hoping to atone for faults and establish merit. For all who take refuge, how dare I forget to proclaim and inform?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, I deeply consider the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Courts, Six Caves, Ten Palaces, Thirty-Six Prisons, the Boundless Iron Enclosure, the Yellow Springs’ winding depths, the Five Sufferings, Three Evil Paths, Nine Yin Realms, and Five Marchmounts—all who govern the laws and examine transgressions. The foolish masses, ignorant of right principle, accumulate karmic debts and indulge in wrongdoing. Thus, their names are bound to the Northern Fengdu, their souls confined to the dark night, imprisoned in yin’s dungeons, fettered for eternity, enduring every torment, with no means of liberation. Without the mysterious pardon of the void, how may their retribution be absolved?\n\nI respectfully present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens.\n\nMay it please Your Great Virtue, whose compassion gives life and whose boundless benevolence extends to all, to specially bestow the jade-pure Dao-qi of the Yuqing and the wondrous radiance of the Lingbao, illuminating the ten directions and brightening the three realms. May the dark passes and shadowed paths be suffused with brilliance, their splendor resplendent, so that the earth-bound souls burdened by sin may be instantly purified. Thus may the aforementioned departed souls emerge from the abyss of night, swiftly behold the morning sun, awaken their suffering hearts, recognize their past lives, repent their transgressions, and advance in goodness, casting off torment to transcend into new life.\n\nI humbly petition for the descent of the Talisman-Officers of Summoning the True and Calling the Spirits, and the Lads of Summoning the True and Calling the Spirits, one each, to reverently invoke the Great Ultimate True Talisman on behalf of the deceased so-and-so. May it be proclaimed to the Eastern Ultimate, within the Palace of Everlasting Joy, to the Greatly Compassionate One, the Most Merciful, the Celestial Worthy of Salvation from Suffering Who Responds to Cries—may You deign to send forth Your awe-inspiring divine radiance, universally illuminating the ten-directional worlds, the layers of deepest yin, the frigid pools of the Northern Capital. May every prison therein be transformed into a realm of yang. May iron cities crumble, fetters and shackles fall away, and the deceased so-and-so be pardoned, all sins dissolved, grievances reconciled, never to pass through hell but to behold the light.\n\nRelying upon the Celestial Worthy and Supreme Saints, may the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Realized Ones of Salvation, the Lads of Salvation, and the Jade Maidens of the Azure Mystery descend in full to the nether prisons. May they shower the Dharma-rain of compassion and sprinkle the precious nectar of sweet dew, so that ice and snow give birth to spring, flames of scorching smoke subside, blades transform into jade trees, swords into blossoming forests. May the biting cold of freezing waters instantly vanish, cauldrons and bronze pillars become cool, the ox-headed jailers all awaken to kindness, and copper serpents and iron dogs forever sever their malevolent paths. May the records of transgressions in the bureaus be erased, the characters of karmic retribution in the ledgers burned. May those condemned to labor—driving thunder, harnessing lightning, drawing waves from the dark sea, bearing stones and hauling sand, circling the celestial round, boring through earth to channel water, moving winds to sweep mountains—all imprisoned exiles, equally partake in this wondrous transformation. May those bound to earthly servitude ascend to the Southern Palace.\n\nGranting this earnest plea, may they be lifted by Your gracious aid. In gratitude, I distinguish this supplication to the Great Dao.\n\nI, your humble servant, bow twice in reverence to make this known. The rites of bathing and refinement follow, as previously stated.\n\nYour dust-borne, lowly servant so-and-so, trembling with awe, kowtows and bows twice to present this memorial. I, a worthless being of the grass and mire, have by error been shaped and elevated to office. Relying entirely upon the perfection of Your creation, how dare I forget my private duty of requital? I vow to rescue the sunken and drowning, striving to fulfill meritorious deeds.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a teacher of the Dao leaves me no choice but to comply. Beginning on such-and-such a day of this month, I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at such-and-such a place, proceeding in accordance with the true precepts.\n\nI deeply consider the long night of the netherworld, the dark homeland of the Yellow Springs, where yin vapors coil along shadowed paths, binding beings in the filth of karmic defilement. Souls fall into the frigid courts, spirits return to the abyss of night, shrouded in gloom and murk, their clarity lost in turbid obscurity. Though talismans and proclamations have been issued to summon and gather them, I fear that, mired in the foulness of the netherworld, they may not attain audience. Without bathing in the divine springs, how may their forms and souls be cleansed?\n\nI humbly present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens. May it please Your Great Virtue, whose compassion gives life and whose boundless benevolence extends to all, to specially bestow the jade-pure Dao-qi of the Yuqing and the wondrous radiance of the Lingbao, illuminating the Orchid Pool and transforming the divine liquid. Thus may the deceased so-and-so bathe in virtue and wash away grime, cleansing the darkness that veils inner and outer, dispelling the heat and affliction of body and spirit. May they attend the True Ones to hear the Dharma and ascend to the Mystery.\n\nI humbly petition for the descent of the Five Spirits and Five Divine Lads, five each from the five directions; the Officers of Dispelling Filth, one hundred twenty each; the Ladies of Washing and Rinsing; and the Jade Maidens of Yellow Splendor, one each. May they promptly descend, drawing the yellow-splendored divine water, the refined essence of the corpse, the golden nectar of sweet dew, the cloud-fat jade wine, and the cloud-cream jade liquor, pouring them into the Orchid Bath. May the deceased so-and-so be bathed therein, their toil and dust washed away, their karmic obstacles dissolved. May their five viscera and six bowels be thoroughly cooled, their nine orifices and four limbs all become pure and clear.\n\nAgain I humbly petition for the descent of the Great Generals Who Govern Water and Fire; the Jade Maidens Who Channel the Flowing Essence of the Stone Radiance Water Mother; the Nine-Light Lads; the Fire-Bell Spirit Lads; and the Host of True Ones Who Respond to the Refining of Souls in the Azure Mystery. May they draw the true water from the Pool of Flowing Moisture in the Eastern Well of Yellow Splendor and the true fire from the Courtyard of Flowing Fire in the Southern Prosperity Vermilion Mound, uniting them in descent to refine and cleanse the polluted vapors for the deceased so-and-so. May their accumulated grime be purged and clarified, their adornment perfected for deliverance, that they may swiftly ascend as immortals. May they forever realize the Unconditioned, never again subject to transmigration.\n\nWith reverence I beseech the Great Dao, distinguishing my plea in sorrow.\n\nYour humble servant, in utmost devotion, bows twice and submits this petition.\n\n[Space for ritual progression, closing formula as in the \"Rite for Ascending and Delivering the Deceased Soul\" chapter.]\n\nThe undersigned minister, in profound awe and trepidation, kowtows and bows twice to submit:\n\nI, of coarse substance and unworthy talent, have been graced by the resplendent favor of my teacher and privileged to glimpse the subtle and profound. The radiant power of the Emperor shines forth—how may I ever repay such grace? I aspire to broadly propagate salvation and clearly assist in the work of generation and transformation.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of the retreat and the duties of my office, which I dare not refuse, I respectfully commence on the appointed day of this month at the designated place, solemnly establishing the Mystery Altar. Following the true precepts, I proceed step by step in the rites.\n\nI earnestly reflect: the aforementioned departed soul has long languished in the dark underworld, bereft of the sunlight. Without deliverance to return to life, how may they attain transcendence and freedom?\n\nI humbly present this memorial, submitting it to the Three Heavens. May the Great Dao, whose kindness embraces all life and whose benevolence knows no bounds, specially bestow the Dao-qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the void and brightening the altar precincts. May the aforementioned departed soul swiftly bathe in the divine light and rejoice, riding the refining deliverance to roam freely.\n\nI humbly petition for the descent of the Lords of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace: the Lord Who Commands Life, the Lord Who Records Deeds, the Lord Who Extends Lifespan, the Lord Who Augments Years, the Lord Who Delivers from Calamity, the Lord Who Delivers People from Death, the Lord of the Southern Culmen of Longevity, the Lord Who Delivers from the World and Commands the Horses, the Venerable Lord of Kindness, and the Boundless Lord Who Raises the Dead and Delivers All People. May they deliver the deceased so-and-so, inscribe their name in golden script upon the jade tablet of fate, and fix their allotted span.\n\nAgain I humbly petition for the descent of the Great Spirit Who Commands the Horses, the Great Spirit Who Oversees Life, the Holy Mother Who Guards the Womb-Chamber, and the Lads of the Cavernous Yang. May they refine and deliver the deceased so-and-so, first entering the Precious Well of Yellow Splendor, then the Divine Courtyard of Flowing Fire. May their substance be washed and their form purged, their yin impurities refined away. May they draw the true qi of the Nine Heavens and bathe in the divine radiance of the Five Thearchs. May their qi and form become whole and complete, ascending in the wind-borne chariot to the Azure Vault, riding the feathered carriage to the Grand Clarity. May they ascend through the Gate of Heaven, receive their tally and match their contract, forever free from transmigration, ever enjoying freedom. May they be transformed and reborn, serving as a token of efficacy.\n\nWith reverence I beseech the Great Dao, distinguishing my plea in sorrow.\n\nThe humble servant, with utmost reverence, prostrates and bows twice to submit this memorial. The opening invocation and closing formula follow the precedent of the *Petition for the Salvation and Ascension of the Deceased*.\n\nYour servant, [Name], holding the humble rank of [Title], in awe and trepidation, kowtows and bows repeatedly to present this plea. By fortune’s grace, my foundational virtue was innate, and I have joyfully encountered this flourishing era. I have received the registers and advanced in rank, transmitted the scriptures and embraced the Dao. Yet I am shamed by my shallow understanding, failing to grasp the subtleties of the profound and tranquil. My transgressions have accumulated, while my merits remain threadbare. Should I be blessed by the grace of creation and sustenance, may I be entrusted with the rites of salvation and deliverance. I shall redouble my cultivation, striving to repay this boundless kindness.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I present this petition for your consideration. In accordance with the intent of the ritual, and as my duty to uphold the teachings, I cannot refuse this charge. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this month, I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding in strict accordance with the true rites.\n\nI humbly reflect: the Three Bureaus and Nine Offices, the Six Caverns and Ten Palaces, the Springs of Qu, the Rivers of Yuan, the Northern Feng, and the Eastern Peak—all scrutinize good and evil with flawless precision. Yet the multitudes of this defiled world remain unaware of self-cultivation. The six roots and three karmic actions, the five desires and six emotions, drive them ceaselessly through darkness and delusion, until their souls return to the shadowy courts and their spirits retreat to the gates of yin. Entangled by grievances and bound by karmic judgments, they languish in the endless night, pitiful beyond measure. Without the compassion of the exalted sages, how could the foolish below escape the suffering of eternal submersion?\n\nI respectfully present this memorial to the Three Heavens, praying that the Dao’s transformative power and the boundless mercy of the Divine may descend. May the qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure illuminate the gloom, dispelling the shadows of sorrow. May the deceased, so-and-so, behold this divine brilliance, recognize their past lives, abandon evil, and turn toward goodness, casting off suffering to be reborn.\n\nI humbly invoke:\nThe Twelve Divine Lads of the Celestial Yang Gates of Radiance,\nOne Heavenly Dao Merit Clerk,\nNine Merit Clerks of the Nine Heavens’ Cloud Paths,\nOne hundred and ten Divine Lads and Jade Maidens of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, tasked with escort and guidance,\neach bearing the Celestial Petition for the Transference of Spirits, unfurling the banners of deliverance to guide the recommended soul. May they be illuminated by the light of Yang below and directed upward along the cloud paths, ascending freely through the vast heavens, forever spared from the wheel of descent.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion. Your humble servant, in utmost sincerity, prostrates twice to make this supplication known.\n\nFollowing the precedent of the *Ritual for Purging the Blood Lake*, I, your subordinate [Name], in trembling awe, kowtow and bow my head to the ground, humbly submitting this petition. Born of dust and mire, a lowly creature of the wilds, I have presumptuously defiled the ranks of the ordained and overreached in my duty to deliver salvation. Yet, unable to repay the virtue of my creation, I vow to propagate the benevolence of transformation and nurturance. For all who take refuge, how dare I neglect this sacred duty of invocation?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, I earnestly reflect upon the deceased, so-and-so, who bears the burdens of three lives and four debts, amassing grievous transgressions; whose six desires and seven passions have readily invited calamity and fault. Their fate ensnared by the perils of childbirth, their spirit cast into the dark gates. The courts of the Northern Feng and Eastern Tai record their name; the prisons of the Gorge Crags and Blood Lake torment their form and soul. They cling to eternal sorrow, with no means of liberation.\n\nYet, considering the origin of their endowed existence—who is not but a spark of ancestral qi? Their misdeeds, self-inflicted, truly merit pity and compassion. The Emperor’s grace knows no bounds; surely, it will bestow mercy.\n\nI humbly present this memorial, beseeching the Three Heavens to deign to cast their gaze upon the depths of the Yellow Springs. May they specially descend the qi of the Jade Purity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating all directions and piercing the long night. May they transform the shadows of yin into the brightness of Yang, and transmute the Blood Lake into a realm of purity. May all imprisoned souls recognize their past lives, abandon evil, embrace goodness, and transcend suffering to be reborn.\n\nI humbly invoke:\nOne Clerk of the Flowing Light of the Three Qi,\nOne Clerk of the Purging of the Blood Lake,\neach accompanied by twenty-four divine officers.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens, beseeching the descent of the True Talisman of the Flowing Light of the Three Qi and the True Talisman of the Jade Prime for Purging the Blood Lake. May these be proclaimed to the Northern Capital, the Fengdu of the Great Iron Enclosure, the Gorge Crags, the Avīci Blood Lake Hell, that the talismanic radiance may shine forth, dispelling the darkness of the nether realms.\n\nI implore that the deceased, so-and-so, and all those imprisoned by the calamities of childbirth, be swiftly absolved of their sin registers, their evil roots eradicated, their enmities resolved, and their nature and consciousness liberated. By this talismanic decree, may they escape the paths of darkness, ascend to the sacred altar, hear the scriptures, and receive the Dharma. May their forms be restored and their essences revived, to be reborn according to their karma.\n\nMoreover, considering their defilement by blood and filth, their form and spirit tainted, they cannot approach the Three Treasures nor draw near the celestial radiance. I humbly invoke:\nOne Purification Lord of the Five Directions and Five Emperors for each direction,\ntwenty-four Jade Maiden Envoys for each,\nthe Great Generals of the Nine Phoenixes for Breaking Defilement,\nthe Great General for Purging Defilement,\nthe Great General for Washing Defilement,\nthe Great General for Eradicating Defilement,\neach accompanied by twenty-four divine officers,\nthe Lord of the Eastern Well for Bathing,\naccompanied by twenty-four divine officers,\nthe Lady of Washing and Rinsing,\nthe Yellow Flower Jade Maiden,\none hundred and twenty Flower Maidens of the Immortals.\n\nMay they descend together, drawing the divine waters of the Yellow Flower, the refined essence of the corpse, the golden nectar of sweet dew, and the jade liqueur of cloud marrow, infusing them into the orchid-scented bath. May they bathe the deceased, so-and-so, washing away the pollution of childbirth and purging the filth of blood. May their inner and outer selves be illumined, their form and spirit purified, their roots, dust, and karmic grime all cleansed and clarified.\n\nFurthermore, considering the deceased’s final moments, wracked by pain and poison, their vital essence and protective qi depleted, their recovery incomplete, I humbly invoke:\nOne Divine Clerk of Celestial Medicine,\nOne Numinous Officer of the Imperial Pharmacy,\nOne Merit Clerk for Healing,\nOne Grand Master of Medicine.\n\nMay they descend together, secretly employing their divine and sagely arts, administering the essence of the sun and moon, the jade mushrooms and golden elixirs, the five-colored divine cinnabar. May they heal all afflictions, that yin and Yang may flow unimpeded, blood and qi harmonized, meridians restored to their origin, and soul and spirit clarified and rectified. May they ascend to the heavens to receive the precepts and be reborn among humans or gods, forever freed from the fear of descent, dwelling in the realm of boundless light.\n\nMay the radiant brilliance of the Numinous Treasure extend its beneficence far and wide, calming the waves of the sea of karma and stilling the tides of the Blood Lake. May all people and creatures receive the gift of life. May the sun of transformation shine upon the Three Paths, and the winds of benevolence spread to the eight directions.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion. Your humble servant, in utmost sincerity, prostrates twice to make this supplication known. The closing ritual follows the precedent.\n\n**Chapter on Transmuting the Corpse to Attain Immortality Through Liberation**\n\nYour humble servant, [Name], in utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates twice, and respectfully submits this memorial:\n\nBy the grace of karmic affinity, I have presumptuously assisted in the wondrous transformation. I have vowed to widely propagate salvation and humbly contribute to the work of creation. Yet my transgressions run deep as abysses, while my merits are thinner than a hair. I earnestly implore Your boundless compassion to overlook my failings.\n\nYour servant reverently states: My late master, [Name], during his lifetime bore the [Scripture Name], received the [Register Name], upheld the [Dharma Name], and served in the [Office Name], diligently cultivating the Dao in the [Oratory Name]. Though a novice with shallow understanding and unfulfilled immortal rank, he could not transcend the earth to soar through the heavens. Having met his liberation in the year [Year], month [Month], and day [Day], he passed through the Great Yin at the age of [Age]. In accordance with the *Three Caverns’ Rites of Immortal Liberation*, his garments, pillow, and mat were inscribed with sacred talismans to protect his corporeal form. Further, following the *Precious Scripture of the Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*, jade-script true writs were installed in the five directions to safeguard his spirit. A propitious day was chosen for his interment, entrusting his form to the earthly palace.\n\nYet I fear that in his lifetime, his merits and virtues were incomplete, hindering his transcendence. Thus, on the [Day] of this month, I humbly establish at [Location] the *Exalted Retreat of the Numinous Treasure’s Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*, lasting two days and nights. May it serve to support, guide, and escort my late master [Name], restoring his form to receive new life and roam the vast heavens.\n\nAs a servant of the Golden Portal, my bond with my master was as deep as that between father and son. Overwhelmed by grief, I follow the true precepts and proceed in due order. I reflect that the Three Bureaus, Nine Offices, One Hundred Twenty Departments, the luminous statutes of the Four Poles, and the Three Caverns’ disciplinary codes shine like the sun and moon, their authority as mighty as thunder. Those who study the Dao and seek truth easily incur transgressions. Without pardon, they must descend to the dark realms—this dreadful prospect fills me with trembling dread.\n\nMy late master [Name] was born in an auspicious era and revered the Mysterious Origin. Yet he had not fully grasped the methods of cultivating truth and harnessing the radiant spirits, though he harbored the aspiration to benefit others and the world. At the sacred festivals of the year, he often violated the precepts. In his progression through the scriptures, registers, and ranks, his audience with the Perfected was incomplete. Moreover, his frequent memorials and petitions may have disturbed the divine officials, leading the Dark Records to inscribe his transgressions. Unresolved yang faults and unatoned yin offenses hastened his departure from this world, plunging him into the depths of desolation.\n\nWere it not for the boundless compassion of the Great Dao, how could later disciples swiftly ascend to the celestial realms? I respectfully present this memorial to the Three Heavens, beseeching the Supreme Saints to bestow mercy, and the Most Perfect to show pity. May they descend the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure to envelop my late master’s soul, spirit, and corporeal form, erasing his transgressions, dissolving his trials, and allowing him to ascend directly to the Void along the light and qi.\n\nI further petition that the Ten Directions and Three Realms, along with all divine administrations, be notified to pardon all his past and present transgressions—whether of the three karmas, six emotions, or those incurred since he began studying the Dao—releasing him from all faults, transferring his name to the Purple Register, and granting him rebirth through transformation.\n\nI humbly invoke:\n- Three *Lingbao* Officials for Eradicating Evil Paths, each with 120 generals and officers;\n- Four Officials for Severing Earthly Roots, each with 120 generals and officers;\n- Five Officials for Flying Beyond Karmic Bonds, each with 120 generals and officers.\n\nMay they descend as one to eradicate the three evils, sever earthly roots, and transcend the five karmic bonds for my late master [Name], inscribing his name in the Great Mystery, ascending in radiance to the formless realm. If his soul has fallen into the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Six Heavens, or Nine Dark Realms, may he be liberated and ascend to the highest realms.\n\nI further invoke:\n- Twelve Envoys of the Golden Dragon Post of the Mysterious Capital;\n- One Heavenly Merit Officer of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Flower;\n- Ten Flying Heavenly Envoys of the Ten Directions, each with 120 generals and officers.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Portal beneath the Jade Throne of the Three Heavens to request the descent of:\n- The Primordial Beginning’s Mandate;\n- The Golden Register and White Tablet;\n- The Longevity Talisman;\n- The Nine-Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Flower Azure Palace;\n- The True Talisman for Ascending to Perfection and Escaping the Cycle of Birth and Death;\n- The Precious Edict of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace.\n\nMay these be proclaimed to the Three Bureaus, Nine Offices, Five Emperors, and Four Administrations, along with the countless yin tribunals. If my late master’s public or private transgressions remain unresolved, may they be pardoned through this immortal liberation merit. If his offenses bind him to his three generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or karmic adversaries in the unseen realms, may his past virtuous deeds be recorded, swiftly securing his pardon. May his sinful records be altered, his name inscribed on the Jade Tablet, his spirit promoted in rank, and his steps elevated to the celestial thoroughfares.\n\nI further invoke the Nine Heavens, Thirty-Two Heavens, Five Venerable Lords, the administrations of all heavens, the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, and the divine hosts of the celestial bureaus. May they each descend their true qi to guide my late master [Name], cleansing his faults and elevating him to the Dao realm. May he resume his office, his qi entering the Mysterious Mystery, attaining rank and perfection, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth.\n\nMoreover, I pray that the true spirits and deities of [Mountain Name] under [Peak Name], along with the Nine Earth Officials, each within their jurisdictions, protect my late master’s corporeal form. May disasters be averted, his tomb remain tranquil, his form secure, his spirit guarded, and his po never rise. May they hold the tally and match the talisman, reviving his bones and flesh, uniting form and spirit. May he roam and ascend, attaining immortality, fully in accordance with the *Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*. May he forever uphold the mysterious grace as a token of gratitude.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion.\n\nThe humble servant, with utmost reverence, prostrates twice to make this solemn report. The concluding rites follow the precedent of the *Chapter on Delivering the Immortal Soul Beyond the Mundane*, as follows:\n\nYour servant, [Name], in trepidation and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates again, and respectfully submits: though unworthy, I stand in the ranks of the martial and have presumptuously assumed the office of salvation, undeservedly granted grace beyond my station, humbled by the knowledge of my own limitations. I vow to magnify the benevolence of the Cavernous Assistance and secretly aid the virtue of creation and transformation. I humbly beseech the vast generative power to look down upon my sincere devotion.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a master of the teachings permits no refusal. I deeply reflect that [Name], by fortunate karmic affinity, has received the shelter of the mysterious shade, worn the registers, upheld the laws, studied the scriptures, and learned the truths. Yet, entangled in the dusty world, he has not grasped the subtleties of the esoteric. In establishing fasts and setting forth offerings, he has often transgressed against dignity; in bowing to present petitions and memorials, he has truly failed in propriety. Breaking fasts and violating precepts, indulging in karma and following his desires, he has frequently lost harmony with Heaven and often succumbed to human cravings. On the Three Primes and Five La, he has not diligently attended the morning audience of the perfected; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, he has never performed repentance or offered thanks. His transgressions are recorded in the Black Register, his name listed in the offices of the mysterious. He has not achieved liberation while seated nor forgotten the self to ascend in spirit. Directing qi and performing the rites for extinction, his body has passed through the Great Yin, his rise or fall unknowable, swiftly enduring months and fortnights.\n\nThe filial son says: Your servant’s bond as father and child runs deep, his heart overwhelmed with grief and dread.\nThe disciple says: Your servant’s duty as teacher and friend is profound, his heart overwhelmed with grief and dread.\n\nWere it not for the compassion of the Most High Sages and the protection of the exalted perfected, who might look down in pity upon our ignorance and mightily grant their covering grace, how could his past transgressions be cleansed and new blessings be guided and welcomed? Therefore, not measuring my own presumption, I humbly present this memorial, one document, to report to the Three Heavens. I prostrate in hope that the great compassion will bend to perfect, the utmost benevolence extend without limit, and a special edict be issued, dispatched to the ten directions, the three realms, and all relevant jurisdictions, to pardon all transgressions of [Name] since the beginning of kalpas and after his birth. May he be transferred to the Azure Palace of the Registers of Destiny, his name moved to the Vermilion Mansion, his form and spirit harmoniously merged, his qi and appearance perfectly rounded. Following the merit of my teachings, may his achievements be assessed and rewards bestowed, his office restored, his qi entering the Mysterious Mystery. May he become a saintly lord of the Golden Towers.\n\nMay your servant greatly propagate the sagely transformation, the karmic fortune unbroken, and attain the body of an immortal, roaming carefree in the Highest Clarity, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth. With reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion.\n\nYour Majesty of the Three Heavens,\n\nWith utmost reverence, your servant prostrates and bows twice to present this humble petition through the void-pacing messengers. The conclusion follows the precedent of the *Petition to Sever Karmic Entanglements*. Your subject, [Name], in trembling awe, kowtows and bows again to submit:\n\nBy nature dull and ignorant, my talents meager, I yet stand in the ranks of the ordained, vowing to deliver all beings through the extension of boundless compassion. How dare I neglect to report those who seek refuge under my care?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this ritual, I humbly observe that the aforementioned departed soul, throughout its earthly existence, indulged in karmic transgressions without restraint or self-discipline. After departing this world, it bears the weight of accumulated offenses, sinking into the depths of suffering. Drifting through the Three Wretched Realms, tossed amid the Five Afflictions, it clings to its attachments, never aspiring to transcendence. Its kin and relatives all suffer contagion; its household, young and old, faces ruin. Seeking a substitute proves impossible, and so the cycle of karmic entanglement continues unbroken. Such profound suffering truly merits compassion. Without the salvific power of the Mysterious Dao, how could this benighted soul attain peace?\n\nI respectfully present this petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching Your boundless compassion to bestow special grace. May the qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure illuminate the Nine Springs and brighten the dark tombs. May the departed [Name] awaken to right mindfulness, repent of past causes, and recognize former errors, thereby seeking ascent. May its lingering entanglements be severed forever, sparing further affliction.\n\nI humbly invoke the following divine hosts to descend:\n- **Shi’an Jun**, **Du Xing Jun**, **Zhu Yang Jun**, **Du Ping Jun**, **Shuo Ping Jun**, **Tian Xuan Jun**, **Shi Xian Jun**, **Gao Du Jun**, **Duan [ ] Jun**, and **Hui Hua Jun** (ten in total);\n- **Tian Yi Bo Shi** and **Shan Tan Da Fu** (one each);\n- **Officers and generals**, 120 each;\n- **Chu Yang Jun**, **Tian Chang Jun**, **Yuan Shang Gao Cang Jun**, and **Zhong Guan Zuo Du Hou Jun** (one each), with **soldiers**, 10,000 each;\n- **Su Che Bai Ma Jun** (one), with **clerks and soldiers**, 100,000;\n- **Can Xing Jiang Jun**, **Tai Bai Bing Xing Ying Huo Li**, **Tie Mian Gan Jian Shi Gui Li Shi**, **Tian Zou Jia Zu**, and **clerks, soldiers, officers, and generals**—may they all descend together to exhort the departed on behalf of the ritual sponsor [Name], resolving tomb disputes, dissolving all attachments, and severing karmic entanglements.\n\nI further invoke:\n- **Duan Zhu Da Jiang Jun** and **Duan Shi Da Jiang Jun** (one each), with **officers, generals, and soldiers**, 100,000;\n- **Jiu Tian Bu Qi Jiang**, **Gan Lu Jiang**, and **Hu Ming Jiang** (one each), with **officers and generals**, 32 each—may they descend together to safeguard against future illness and suffering, severing the karmic entanglements of the departed. May [Name]’s form and soul find ease, the tomb remain undisturbed, and all summons or disputes be effortlessly resolved. May sins be absolved, and the soul ascend to transcendence, forever escaping the darkness of the netherworld.\n\nMay the ritual sponsor [Name], along with all kin, relatives, and household members, rejoice in carefree bliss, forever freed from contagion. May their spirits be at peace, their vital forces harmonized, and may they enjoy wealth, longevity, health, and tranquility as a sign of this covenant.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao and humbly beseech its compassion. Your servant prostrates and bows twice again.\n\nHearing the empty passage, the closing formula follows as before. Commencing the \"Proclamation to the Mysterious Vault\" chapter:\n\nI, your humble servant [Name], in trepidation and reverence, bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and bow twice again in supplication. I, undeserving, have received the profound grace of the Dao, presumptuously assuming the ranks of the true, looking up to its nurturing transformation and bearing deep gratitude below. I aspire to extend the boundless generosity of the ever-generating Way and humbly aid the profound benevolence of its ceaseless transformation. My entreaties have been earnest, and I dare not delay in making this report.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of the ritual, I, your servant, deeply consider the site where the altar is to be erected. Since the ashes of kalpas past, yin impurities have congealed, wandering miasmas have sealed the four directions, dust and haze have flowed and settled, and murky filth has flown and spread. Without the power of purification and release, how can the veneration of the mysterious and true be made solemn? Moreover, with residual qi intermingling and beings flourishing in profusion, it is fitting to dissolve and cleanse, that purity may be wholly preserved.\n\nI respectfully present this memorial, one document, to be heard by the Three Heavens. Humbly I beseech that great compassion be bestowed with grace, that the transformative power of the Dao descend in particular. May the qi of the Jade Purity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure illumine above the clouds and mists, and shine below upon the wind-formed ramparts, so that the ten flowers and eight extremities are all pervaded with luminous clarity. May the ritual altar thus established be bathed in numinous light, not a speck of dust remaining, its interior and exterior fused in purity, sacred mushrooms spontaneously growing.\n\nI respectfully invoke the descent of the Lords of Purification from the Five Directions and Five Emperors, each one, along with 120 official generals, bearing the Five Harmonies Fragrant Springs and the true essence of dharma-water, to descend together, washing and purifying the numinous altar, dissolving and removing all defilements and impurities.\n\nOne thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of Immortal Flowers, along with the Nine Phoenixes from the *Lu of Breaking Impurities*, and the Great Generals of Transporting Impurities, Resolving Impurities, Gathering Impurities, Repelling Impurities, Eliminating Impurities, Severing Impurities, Washing Impurities, and Sweeping Impurities—one from each category—together with 120 official generals each, and the Water-Mastering Dragon Lords of the Five Directions, descend as one to cleanse and purify all implements, vessels, and structures prepared for the ritual, so that halls and dwellings may all attain clarity, utterly free of residual defilement.\n\nFurthermore, I invoke the descent of the Talisman Clerks of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, and the Youths of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, each one, bearing the *Highest Perfected Jade Purity King of Descending Perfection Talismanic Mandate* and the *Primal August Summoning Spirits Talismanic Mandate*, to proclaim to the Three Realms, whistle forth commands to the Ten Directions, dispatch and employ the thousand spirits, and ally with the ten thousand sages, safeguarding the altar’s precepts and rectifying the ritual’s efficacy from beginning to end, that no obstacles or hindrances arise.\n\nMay it further be decreed that the command be issued to the Mysterious Altar to receive its charge, and to the offices, bureaus, courts, and departments of the Numinous Treasure Immortal Administration, along with their lords, generals, and clerks, to descend in accordance with the servant’s invocation, jointly aiding the great rectification. Thus may the ritual sponsor [Name]’s virtuous fruits be fully realized, auspicious omens secretly bestowed, the grace received today flowing into future lives. When the altar is dispersed and the merits declared, may the covenant not be betrayed.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao and humbly beseech its compassion. Your servant prostrates and bows twice again.\n\nHearing the empty passage, the closing formula follows as before.\nHere ends the *Middle Fascicle of Memorials to the Three Caverns*.\nHere begins the *Lower Fascicle of Memorials to the Three Caverns*.\n\nMemorial for the Refinement and Salvation of the Nine Heavens\n\nYour subordinate [Name], in utmost reverence and awe, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully memorializes:\n\nI have heard that the Great Dao, in its primordial division, first expounded the teaching beyond words; the Heavenly Worthy, in spreading transformation, gradually bestowed the scriptures of creation. Universally delivering all beings, it encompasses the myriad dharmas. With utmost reverence and awe, I prostrate and bow twice again.\n\nReflecting humbly, I, unworthy and base, have presumptuously ascended the immortal ranks, receiving and upholding the teachings and precepts, following the wondrous canon. I have elucidated the primordial model of the First Azure and disseminated the precious chapters of the Cavernous Mystery. I have sworn to take the deliverance of the dead as my heart and pledged the salvation of the living as my vow. Having been cleansed by the earnestness of my supplication, I now venture to extend my private entreaty.\n\nYour subordinate, in accordance with the sponsor’s intent and reverently consulting the mysterious texts, shall perform the refinement and salvation. Without the compassionate aid of the exalted perfected, how could the drowned and lost be universally saved? Thus, I pour forth my sincerity and presumptuously appeal to the celestial audience.\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Supreme Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Unity and Salvation, whose sageliness and benevolence are boundless, whose compassion and solicitude are utmost. Mounting the immortal chariot of the Nine Masters, you scatter the auspicious radiance of the hundred treasures. Guiding and uplifting the floating lives, you do not violate your original vow. I humbly beseech that the true talismans be issued and that your beneficent grace widely bestow its moisture.\n\nPouring sweet dew upon the fiery mountain, it transforms into refreshing coolness; fanning the divine wind upon the sword trees, they change into towering forests. Thus may the souls undergoing refinement ascend to the cavernous halls of yang, attain the ranks of perfected immortals, and augment blessings for humans and heavens. May the lonely souls of the six paths be universally aided, and all escape the bitter destinies of the three realms. Above, I pray for the great creation; below, I fulfill the sincere devotion of my heart. I, your servant, can scarcely contain my reverence as I gaze toward the heavens and long for the sagely presence, overwhelmed with earnest trepidation.\n\nWith utmost awe and fear, I bow my head and prostrate myself, respectfully submitting this memorial for your attention.\n\n[Date] [Rank and Name of the Memorialist]\n\n---\n\nThe subsequent eight memorials share the same opening and closing as above, differing only in their central sections.\n\n---\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and Salvation, whose majesty and power extend boundlessly, whose wisdom and insight are perfectly all-encompassing. Responding to a single thought, you deliver the depths of the Yellow Springs; filling the ten directions, you uplift the shades of the departed. The four kinds of birth receive your grace; the six paths hold your kindness in gratitude. I humbly beseech that your vast compassion be specially bestowed, your benevolent grace widely proclaimed, and that this be memorialized to the Primordial Supreme Emperor. May the Jade Lads of the Great One be dispatched to open the *Purple Yang Jade Summit* scriptures and reveal the talismanic writings of *phoenix-qi* and *dragon-script*. Universally bestow upon all, widely deliver the boundless. May the Dharma rain moisten and soak, dissolving transgressions and sins; may the auspicious mist thicken and flourish, halting grievances and enmities. Together, by the merit of refinement and salvation, may all attain the joy of carefree wandering.\n\n---\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Dark Realms and Deliverance from Sin, whose perfected radiance refines the upper realms and whose power to deliver suffering reaches the depths below. Releasing the unimpeded divine light, you illuminate the great thousandfold worlds. Your mysterious grace broadly covers all; at dawn, all awaken. I humbly beseech that jade talismans be issued, opening the iron citadel to deliver the condemned; that the black ledgers be burned away, extinguishing the fire’s haze and ending bitterness. Thus may the departed have all myriad evils dissolved and the six senses purified. May their shadows escape the nine yin domains, their souls ascend to the heavens of the three *qi*. Forever parted from the paths of delusion, may all ascend the road of life.\n\n---\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of the Vermilion Mound and Deliverance of Lives, whose august presence crowns the Vermilion Palace and whose Dao governs the cinnabar realms. You expound compassion to save all beings and extend benevolence to deliver humanity. I humbly hope that your vast compassion be deeply moved, that talismanic decrees be issued. Those not yet delivered, may they all ride the merit of refinement and salvation; those not yet reborn, may they all attain the wondrousness of renewal. Forever parting from the earthly prisons, may they ascend directly to the heavenly halls.\n\n---\n\nI reverently contemplate...\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of the Cinnabar Realm and Fire Refinement, whose Dao crowns the Southern Palace and who governs as the Red Emperor. You wield the wondrous power of molten gold, transforming withered bones into living beings. In every place, You respond to the moment; in every direction, You establish transformation. Humbly I beseech that Your divine radiance blaze forth, refining the corpse-spirits to be reborn; that Your dharmic power shine brightly, delivering the hidden souls to restore their lives. Below, may they escape the Northern Capital’s courts; above, may they ascend to the Southern Pole’s heavens. Extending to the Nine Springs, may they forever part from the Five Sufferings.\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of the Great Bridge of Salvation, whose boundless virtue cherishes life and whose perfect benevolence embraces all beings. You spread the ladder and ferry across the sea of suffering, delivering all kinds from the ford of delusion. From ancient times to the present, You grasp the sun and moon. Humbly I beseech that Your precious banner extend its reach, opening a path through the hidden darkness; that the true *qi* flow downward, unfurling a rainbow across the sky. May You guide these departed ones to ascend to that heaven. Release them from the transgressions of past errors, and let them realize today the fruit of their alliance with the true. May the suffering souls of the Yellow Springs all attain freedom.\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal’s Incarnation, whose body is the Dao and who responds to the primordial. You bear myriad names across infinite kalpas, traversing the causes and conditions of vast eons. Universally nurturing all beings, You broadly open the gate of eternal goodness.\n\nHumbly I beseech You to bestow Your grace and examine their plight, rescuing the souls of the Three Wretched Realms from myriad deaths; to absolve their sins and erase their transgressions, that they may ascend the Ninefold Refinement’s path of rebirth. From lower grades to higher grades, may they swiftly escape the wheel of retribution; from action-bound existence to the realm of non-action, may they ever dwell in purity and order.\n\nI further pray that Your benevolence extend universally, reaching as countless as the sands of the river.\n\nReverently contemplating the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of Joyous Freedom, whose body embodies the Dao at the dawn of transformation, whose spirit condenses beyond all things. You transcend the subtlest of subtleties, abiding serenely in the highest of heavens. Your merit pervades the hidden darkness, Your grace blankets the cycles of life and death. Humbly I beseech You to illumine the sun and moon, to ride the winds and clouds, delivering these departed souls from their evil destinies. May they rejoice in the realm of eternal spring, wander freely in the land of endless day. May the karmic kin of countless kalpas all attain liberation at once.\n\nReverently contemplating the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of Perfect Floral Brilliance, whose merit fulfills the Six Perfections, whose Dao realizes the Three Vehicles. Your countenance is majestic and dignified, Your blessings and wisdom complete. Only through utmost sincerity may one move You; truly Your vast salvation knows no bounds. Humbly I beseech You to bend Your compassionate mercy, to broadly extend skillful means, that heavenly light may shine below and the earthly prisons be opened. May the departed consciousness transcend mortality, relying on the merit of this fast to attain higher grades. May they be nurtured in the Hall of Radiant Yang, ascending to the Court of Great Possession. I further pray that Your remaining blessings subtly support their descendants.\n\nThe resplendent talismans of the Nine Heavens’ Emperors are appended below.\n\nYour humble servant, [Name], bows reverently and respectfully submits this memorial:\n\nI humbly observe that the Two Modes nurture all beings, and the thousand truths all converge in the Three Fields; that the Nine *qi* gather to form the body, and the ten thousand images array themselves in the Six Repositories. When the hundred meridians are harmonious and flowing, the seven apertures open unimpeded, the *po* is tranquil, the *hun* is serene, the spirit is clear, and the *qi* is refreshed. I now, on behalf of the disciples of [Place], present this altar petition, beseeching on behalf of the deceased [Name] to release their grievances, absolve their sins, wash away their filth, and purify their dust, that they may awaken to their original source and distinguish purity from impurity.\n\nWe, Your servants, have performed the fast and practiced the Dao, issuing talismans and decrees to extinguish sins, break through the darkness, transmit talismans, and confer precepts. We grant the register of the local Heavenly Court, bestow the talisman for transcending life and death, and make offerings to the ten directions, invoking the assembly of sages.\n\nYet I still fear that the departed soul, having committed sins in life and accumulated transgressions in death, may have sunk into evil destinies or risk falling into the wheel of rebirth—transforming their form and changing their body, never again to regain human form. I, having received from my master the Ninefold Refinement talismans, am permitted to deliver the sunken and lost. Diligently following the ritual codes, I reverently invoke the Primordial Harmonious Wondrous *qi* to entwine the deceased soul, that they may inwardly glow and outwardly shine, their essence harmonizing with heaven and earth, once more attaining human or heavenly rebirth and attending the court of the Most High.\n\nMay they, by the day, undergo refinement, and by the hour, ascend in rank. I respectfully submit this memorial, addressing the Emperor of the Boundless Joyous Heaven. Humbly I await Your heavenly compassion, that You may deign to grant this petition, uphold the talismanic decree, and specially bestow the Primordial Yellow Effulgent *qi*, coiling ninefold around their spiritual womb, that the womb-origin of the deceased [Name] may be unobstructed, ascending to heaven for regeneration, and thus regain the path of human life.\n\nI am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Reverently bowing twice, I respectfully submit this memorial. The subsequent eight memorials follow the same form, only changing the names of the deities addressed.\n\nTo the Most Supreme Meditative and Virtuous Emperor of the Boundless Longevity Heaven,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Purple Portal of Profound Obscurity,\nthat the fetal knots of the deceased [Name] may dissolve, their root be made whole in body,\nand they regain the path of human life.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heavenly Watch of Brahmā’s Extension,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Luminous Immortals of Enduring Spirit,\nthat the soul-gate of the deceased [Name] may be refined by immortality to circulate essence,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of Silent and Wondrous Arts,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Radiant Corpse’s Profound Effulgence,\nthat the corporeal gate of the deceased [Name] may descend immortality to attain tranquility,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of Joyous Non-Arrogance of Pāramitā,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Central Spirit of the Five Immortals,\nthat the five viscera of the deceased [Name] may be cleansed and cooled to preserve spirit,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of Resonant Transformation of the Profound Mystery,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Soaring Perfected in Harmonious Fusion,\nthat the six bowels of the deceased [Name] may be opened and flourishing, their gastric tube generating fluids,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of Numinous Transformation and Brahmā’s Assistance,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Lofty Immortals of the Profound Canon,\nthat the orifices of the deceased [Name] may be opened to keen perception, their stellar lodges bright and clear to circulate spirit,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of Lofty Emptiness and Luminous Purity,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the True Spirit’s Transformative Coagulation,\nthat the three divisions and eight landscapes of the deceased [Name] may be ordered, their form and spirit made whole to preserve perfection,\nand they regain a human form.\n\nTo the Emperor of the Heaven of No-Thought, No-Knots, and No-Sorrow,\nmay You specially bestow the ninefold-coiling *qi* of the Spontaneous and Mystically Illuminating,\nthat the three barriers and five viscera of the deceased [Name], their joints and root-source, may in their original beginning all at once be filled with the *qi* of life-generating spirit, their voice ever invoking spirit, their hair and body fully regenerated.\n\nThe Lower Scroll of the Memorials to the Three Caverns of the Most High is now complete.",

Yet I remain dull and ignorant, my faults deep as abysses, my merits lighter than a mustard seed. Though I have humbly received nurturance, I have not been punished for my transgressions. To repay the grace of salvation and deliver beings, I dare not presume.\n\nYour servant respectfully submits the intent of this retreat.\n\nI deeply fear that in the netherworld’s winding paths, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Iron Enclosure and the Unrelenting Prison, beneath layers of darkness and dense gloom, the souls of the condemned languish, bound for eternity without release. If they do not return their spirits to the Azure Ultimate and petition the Azure Radiance, invoking universal compassion, how shall they escape? Only by approaching the Mysterious Threshold at dawn to receive refinement and rebirth may this be achieved. Thus, I, foolish though I am, humbly present this memorial to ascend to the Azure Palace, beseeching the power of wisdom and mercy, the might of the divine to bestow grace. May the wondrous *qi* of the Azure Mystery, the radiance of a hundred treasures, pierce the dense gloom, illuminate the endless night, and shine without fail across heaven above and heaven below. May the departed soul [Name] transcend the dark abyss, realize the wondrous emptiness of the void, have sins absolved and transgressions pardoned, and ascend to the Golden Towers.\n\nYour servant respectfully invokes the Azure Mystery’s Youths of Salvation, Jade Maidens of Salvation, and the Envoys of the Nine-Dragon Talismanic Command, to ascend to the Palace of Everlasting Joy in the Eastern Ultimate. At the Jade Steps, may they request the descent of the Nine-Dragon Talismanic Command of the Eastern Florescence, proclaiming it to the boundless divine realms of the ten directions, the shadowy paths and hidden passes, and all places of punishment and confinement. For the departed [Name], may they swiftly expunge the ledgers of sin, eradicate the roots of evil, and guard body and soul, granting immediate liberation.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Azure Mystery’s Divine Officers of the Yellow Register for Prison-Breaking, the Wardens of Prison-Breaking, the Talisman-Bearing Divine Officers, and the Flying Dragon Couriers of the Talismanic Command, to descend as one. May they issue decrees to shatter the netherworld’s dungeons, command the underworld’s officials, and cause the flames of the Fire Mountain to subside, the waves of the Ice Pool to still, the sword trees to transform into blossoming groves, and the blade forests into jade trees. May the hells crumble, the iron cities open, and the departed spirits be released from torment, drawn to the altar’s steps to behold the light.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the Celestial Officers of the True Light of the Great Unity to Guide Souls, the Divine Officers of the Three *Qi* of Red Light to Transform Souls, the Envoys to Seek Souls across the Six Paths, the Judges of the Night-Shining Summons, and the Swift Flying Cloud Divine Officers, to descend as one. May they pursue and retrieve the true soul and correct spirit of the departed [Name], returning them to the yang realm, where they may bathe, change garments, pay homage to the perfected, and receive sustenance.\n\nFurthermore, your servant invokes the True Bureau of Refinement and Salvation of the Southern Prosperity Palace of the Vermilion Mound Fire Treasury, the Jade Maidens and Youths of the Yellow Florescence, and the Generals of Water and Fire, to descend as one.

May the celestial grace respond in kind. With reverence and awe, your servant bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this entreaty.\n\nYour servant, [Your Name], of [Your Prefecture, County, and Abbey], presently engaged in the purification rites at the Palace of Everlasting Joy within the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Culmen, addresses the Most Merciful and Compassionate, the Ever-Responsive, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering, the Jade August One.\n\nIn the [Year] of the Great Year Star, on the [Day] of the [Month], at [Location], your servant, with utmost reverence, prostrates himself and submits this Eastern Culmen Memorial.\n\nThis month, on the [Day], for the pious disciple [Name] who has established the Azure Mystery Wondrous Fast of Salvation from Suffering for [Number] days and nights, to deliver the soul of the departed [Name], your servant respectfully presents this memorial.\n\nIt is humbly observed that when the Vermilion Radiance unfolded the cosmic chart, the loving sun circulated through the Six Directions; when the Azure Mystery governed the turning of the ages, auspicious mists flourished in the Nine Netherworlds. The luminous white jade light shines forth, and the resplendent purple-golden form illumines all. Ever-responsive to cries for aid, ever-compassionate to those who invoke, Your boundless deliverance knows no limit, and thus we turn in devotion and make our plea.\n\nWith reverence and awe, your servant bows his head to the ground, reflecting upon the soul of the departed [Name], lingering in the snares of the worldly net, traversing the mechanisms of dust. In the thousand-fathom sea of desire, they drift upon wild waves; in the ten-thousand-ren river of attachment, they cannot escape the surging currents. Their spirit drowned in a single moment, their steps sank into the ninefold night. The copper gates clang shut, the iron ramparts enclose all around. In silent sorrow, they vainly long for a path to life; in frantic anguish, they suddenly realize there is no gate to salvation from death. Had they not turned their lives toward the Azure Flower, how could their souls ascend beyond the Yellow Turbidity?\n\nWe reverently invoke the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Culmen, the Palace of Everlasting Joy, the Most Merciful and Compassionate, the Ever-Responsive, the Great Unity Savior from Suffering, the Jade August One. Your majestic power pervades all, Your wisdom and strength encompass the universe. In the seven-jeweled forest of towering trees, You pour forth the radiant sweet dew; upon the nine-hued lotus throne, You spread the resplendent clouds of compassion. Your true light blankets the great thousand worlds, and Your auspicious qi unfurls across the hundred millions. All who dwell within Your transforming influence are surely uplifted and guided.\n\nMay Your sagely virtue shine forth, and Your divine might surge boundlessly.

With this memorial, your servant humbly submits his report.\n\nWe reflect that when the Azure Mystery opens its court, propitious clouds ascend with the radiance of the Three Poles; when the Yellow Register establishes its palace, flying mists scatter their hues to the eight directions. The sun of wisdom shines forth from the Lion’s Throne, and the divine wind blazes in the Dragon’s script. Thus, clutching this vermilion petition, I raise this plain silk in supplication.\n\nYour servant, trembling with awe, bows his head and knocks his forehead to the ground, mindful of his fortune to ride this luminous destiny and partake in this flourishing era. Upholding the Dao and enacting heaven’s decrees, he follows in the footsteps of the exalted; receiving the mandate and proclaiming virtue, he clasps the lotus throne to attend upon your countenance. Having received the grace of nurture, how dare he not repay the blessings of cultivation?\n\nReverently considering the Most Compassionate One of the Eastern Pole, within the Palace of Eternal Joy—the Supreme Unity, Savior from Suffering, Heavenly Worthy of Jade Majesty—who sits in sublime majesty, eternally serene. Responding to thoughts with mercy, he scatters auspicious mist at the gates of death; answering cries with compassion, he showers sweet dew upon the portals of life. Universally, he delivers those sunk in darkness, all drawn to his salvific guidance.\n\nMay the departed soul swiftly depart the night and hasten into the dawn; may the dark gloom be erased from the registers, dissolving the illusory shadows of the great chiliocosm; may the Azure Florescence fix their name in the ledgers, and may they ride the true light of the Supreme Unity. Forever may they attend the Purple Gold, ascending to the heights of Jasper Jade.\n\nYour servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion. Respectfully presenting this memorial, he submits it with utmost sincerity.\n\nOn the [Day] of the [Month] of the [Year], your servant [Your Name], prostrating himself, respectfully submits this *Memorial for Breaking the Prisons of Hell*.\n\nAgain, your servant [Your Name] bows in reverence.",

Daring to knock upon the sacred portal of compassion, I implore the spreading of salvific mercy. With a hundred bows I lay bare my plea, with a single heart I beseech your decree.\n\nTruly trembling in awe, I kowtow and prostrate myself, deeply concerned that in the frigid courts the lingering souls stagnate, in the abyssal ravines the forsaken spirits languish. Iron ramparts encircle them, enduring ten thousand kalpas of fettered suffering; copper gates blaze with radiance, bearing a thousand ages of carceral severity. Ghostly officials enforce the laws of yin and yang; netherworld clerks administer punishments of water and fire. Without your edict to break these bonds, how may they ascend and transcend?\n\nReverently considering the Heavenly Center of the Eastern Ultimate, within the Palace of Eternal Joy, the Greatly Compassionate One, the Supreme Unity Salvific and Suffering-Relieving Heavenly Worthy, August Jade Sovereign—ever responsive to cries, ever aiding with creation—you descend your majestic radiance upon the myriad treasures, parting the layered darkness; you wield the divine staff of the Five Numinous Ones, piercing the accumulated night. May you deign to incline your profound hearing, resplendently bestow your assent, proclaiming the decree in accord with the statutes, secretly aligning with the dragon tally to usher in the dawn; may you, following the rites, shatter the prisons, instantly bringing spring to the kennels of suffering.\n\nThus may the departed soul of [Name] depart the night without sorrow, ride the dawn with joy. As their luminous splendor blazes forth, the ninefold ramparts gleam bright; as their spirit flies with the sacred staff, the three paths know peace and prosperity.

      "translated_text": "With utmost reverence and overwhelming gratitude, I humbly present this memorial to make known these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial for the Water and Fire Refinement**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates and declares:\nOn the ___ day of this month, for the disciple [Name] of the fast’s law, who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights to deliver the departed soul of [Name] and ascend them to the immortal realms, we now request the descent of water and fire for refinement.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate and reflect: Heaven and Earth are fixed in their positions, spreading the ancestral qi to illumine the turning cycles; Fire and Water divide their essences, exhausting their numinous power to nurture all things. The Five Scripts unfold in vastness, the myriad beings are shaped in perfection—desiring to bestow the divine radiance of the Nine Refinements, we rely wholly upon the sacred workings of the Two Modes.\n\nWith awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead, deeply concerned that the departed soul of [Name], bound by karmic dust and ingrained habits, is enmeshed in the coils of karmic filth. The root of life in the Nine Qi may seek to return to its origin, yet the stem of death in the Five Forms remains severed from the Void. Without the refining crucible to ascend on high, how may they transcend and rise directly?\n\nThe moon’s vessel gleams with radiance, drawing the golden essence of the Eastern Well; the solar mirror gathers its rays, pouring forth the vermilion fire of the Southern Cinnabar. Without the aid of such reflection, who shall assist in their manifestation?\n\nI reverently consider the Most High, formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Towers and Jade Palaces. Your Dao parallels Yin and Yang, your virtue encompasses all that is borne and covered. May you deign to issue your sacred command, sending down the luminous essence of the Five Dragons; may you dispatch the divine perfected, spreading the transformative power of the Nine Phoenixes’ resplendent harmony. Thus may the departed be restored from their bones and raised from death, and through the oversight of the true, be delivered to life.\n\nNine traversals complete the person, as qi upon qi returns to the marvel of the living spirit; ten cycles refine the being, as spirit upon spirit reveals the mystery of qi’s flow. Departing the night to face the origin, they ride the dawn and mount the light.\n\nWith utmost urgency and longing for your grace, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial to the Great Dao**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates and declares:\nOn the ___ day of this month, on behalf of the disciple [Name] of the fast, who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights to deliver the departed soul of [Name], I now present this memorial to make known these words.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate and reflect: Knocking upon the Nine Gates to serve with clarity, clouds gather in the Pure and Subtle; ascending the Eight Stairs to offer praise, winds are pure in the Dark and Mysterious. Seeking the impartial wisdom of the Three Ultimates, we receive the encompassing grace of the Ten Flowers. Rain and dew suffuse, sun and stars shine brightly—daring to take refuge in the Maple’s Lord, I pour forth the devotion of the sunflower’s heart. Earnestly I hope for your lofty brilliance to cast its illuminating gaze.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, deeply mindful that the departed soul of [Name], woven with the threads of grievance and warped in nature, is ensnared by the net of sin. The Three Delusions remain unremoved, casting them into confusion and inversion upon the lost path; the Four Bonds are unguarded, driving them to wander the crooked ways in circles. The flower of sin accumulates for ages in the Northern Feng, the leaves of transgression pile high in the records of the Eastern Tai. In the vast and desolate night abyss, the terror of water and fire strikes the heart; in the silent and cold courtyard, the sight of Yin and Yang shatters the courage. Thus we reverently establish repentance and offer this fast.\n\nWithout the boundless ocean of the Supreme Sage, how could the foolish below be nurtured in the spring of renewal?\n\nI reverently consider the Most High, formless and nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Towers and Jade Palaces. Your majesty is beyond measure, your vastness defies description. Condensing wondrous being to bestow essence, you transform and spread across the Nine Lands; conceiving the Void to nurture purity, your governance pervades the Three Heavens. You manifest compassion for the suffering and sorrowful, broadly bestowing the grace of mercy.\n\nMay your numinous light banish the night, may the ancestral qi flourish eternally. Command the Dark Bureaus to erase the records of grievance; summon the Cinnabar Bureau to dissolve the registers of transgression. May the departed soul of [Name] depart the night in joy and ride the dawn in delight. May they transcend the Three Realms, free from the sorrow of confinement or oppression; may they be commanded to traverse the Nine Gates, blessed with the joy of escort and welcome.\n\nHow dare I not look up to the transforming sun, striving to propagate the Dao’s wind? Ascending the azure jade to lay bare my heart, I endeavor to receive the phoenix’s grace; gazing upon the purple gold to bow in homage, I forever bathe in the dragon’s favor.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Memorial for the Blood Lake**\n\nThe unworthy official, [Name], prostrates...",

      "translated_text": "Memorial now submitted: On the ___ day of this month, for the patron ___ who has reverently established a fast of ___ days and nights, I have performed rites to deliver the departed soul of ___, that they may ascend to the immortal realms. It is observed that this person perished in childbirth, their form and spirit defiled by foulness, and only through the sagely creation may this be thoroughly purged. May their qi and appearance be made whole, their protective and nourishing forces restored.\n\nI, your servant, prostrate myself and reflect: the great virtue of ceaseless generation has long been revered for its benevolence bestowed below; with utmost care and humility, I now lay bare the sincerity of my plea. May the dark and oppressive be lifted from earthly confinement, and the mysterious and void be graced with celestial light. With reverence, I bow twice to present my petition and offer my wholehearted entreaty.\n\nI, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reflecting thus: by fortunate karmic affinity, I have encountered this flourishing era. To propagate the Dao and emulate Heaven, I have nearly fulfilled my duty in the dragon’s presence; to receive and proclaim virtue, I have sworn to disseminate boundless felicity. Yet I deeply consider the departed soul of ___, who, entrusted to the female condition, sought to navigate the truths of existence. Ensnared within the web of attachment, she lost the way of earth and wood; entangled in worldly mechanisms, she sullied the purity of gold and blossoms. For nine nights, she sank in the sea of suffering; in a single moment, she drowned in the Blood Lake. The jailers wielded their authority, turning in an instant to test her in the trials of yin and yang; the underworld officials displayed their might, startling her heart with the fetters of water and fire. Without the vast grace of imperial favor, how could she ascend to the transformations of yang?\n\nI reverently contemplate the Most High, formless and nameless, the void and spontaneous, the Perfect and Great Dao, the Supreme and Primordial Honored One, Sovereign of the Golden Portal and Jade Palace. The Dao encompasses all in its embrace, and virtue harmonizes the hidden and the manifest. The benevolent wind stirs the eight distant realms, and all spirits rejoice; the transformative rain nourishes the nine layers, and countless souls beam with joy. May You look upon my earnest plea with favor and grant me the abundant blessings of Your grace.\n\nI humbly pray that You may issue the crane’s pardon and bestow the phoenix’s decree. May the three qi radiate their light, offering hope at dawn’s first glow; may the ten flowers illuminate the darkness, dispelling the gloom of night. Thus may the departed soul of ___ be cleansed of filth, her body and spirit filled with joy. Crossing the Crimson Mound, may she have her fate delivered and ten thousand sins dissolved in purity; may her name be erased from the Black Register, and a thousand grievances scattered in harmony. May her spirit be as jade in its purity, her steps light as spring’s warmth.\n\nWith utmost urgency and overwhelming emotion, I humbly present this memorial to make known my plea. I, your servant, with awe and trepidation, bow my head and knock my forehead, reverently submitting these words.\n\nYear ___ Month ___ Day\nThe unworthy official, [Name], respectfully submits this memorial.\n\nMemorial for the Six Canopies\nMemorial to the Mysterious Master\nThe unworthy official, [Name], bows twice.",

For the supplication and exorcism concerning [Matter], I humbly beseech the celestial grace to bestow protection and peace. The altar is now dissolved, and the retreat concluded.\n\nI reflect that as the sun nears its pure radiance, I have been graced to behold the dragon-borne countenance; as the Dao’s fortune unfolds across the heavens, I rejoice in following the steps of the phoenix-patterned path. The strictness of the retreat’s precepts has been fulfilled, owing to the weight of the master’s authority. With the morning rites now complete, my rustic sincerity is once more laid bare. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with humility that I, in error, inherited the mysterious tradition and presumptuously received its vast transformation. Though the rites exalt mindfulness, I have failed to move the divine workings upon the sacred altar; though the scriptures demand solemnity, I have been remiss in cultivating the cinnabar tablets.

      "translated_text": "Memorial to the Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns\n\nI humbly report that on the ___ day of this month, for the ritual disciple [Name], I have solemnly conducted a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights, opening the clouded paths to deliver the departed soul of [Name], that they may ascend to the blessed realms. I have also performed prayers of exorcism for [matter], beseeching peace and protection, and now conclude the retreat with the dispersal of the altar.\n\nI prostrate myself, reflecting that the Dao responds to the Purple Yang, ordering the ranks of the mysterious to assist transformation; governance unfolds in the Yellow Primal, arraying the registers of remedies to dispense grace. Fortunate is the strictness of the retreat’s discipline, which relies entirely upon the weight of the masters’ authority. With awe and trepidation, I bow my head and knock my forehead.\n\nI recall with dread that I, though unworthy, have inherited the mysterious lineage and presumptuously received its vast transformation. The statutes exalt mindfulness, yet I have failed to invoke the divine workings at the altar of mystery; the scriptures prescribe solemnity, yet my heart has not fully cultivated the cinnabar tablets. Presuming to lead the foremost office of response and proclamation, I fear incurring the severe judgments of the records. I look up, hoping for compassion, and bow down, praying for deliverance.\n\nWith reverence, I address the Masters before whom this memorial is presented: the Venerable Scripture Master of the Numinous Treasure, the Venerable Register Master of the Numinous Treasure, and the Venerable Deliverance Master of the Numinous Treasure. The balance of the Water Office is just, the mirror of ice impartial. They reward the true and numinous, inscribing merit upon the azure tablets; they uphold the ranks of the manifest, excising transgressions from the mysterious registers. Assuredly they return in jade chariots, swiftly turning toward the jasper palaces. The ten thousand heavens and ten thousand earths are equally molded by the benevolence of the mysterious ultimate; the one yin and one yang together encompass the gracious blessings of the vast primal harmony. I can scarcely contain my fervent gratitude. With reverence, I present this memorial in thanksgiving.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\n**Memorial to Unveil and Communicate with the True**\n\nYour humble servant, the minor ritual officer [Name], bowing twice with awe and trepidation, knocks his forehead to the ground, and respectfully states:\n\nI prostrate myself, reflecting that the hundred thousand myriad layers of the Dao’s qi crystallize into jade-like radiance; the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures expound the teachings of the golden perfected. I look up to the crimson palaces where dragons and phoenixes ascend, and bow before the solemn ranks of the mysterious altar, where mandarin ducks and egrets stand in order. Daring to purify the bamboo slips and first set forth my sincere words, I bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation.\n\nYesterday, according to the ritual statutes, the disciple [Name] requested that a [Name] Retreat of ___ days and nights be solemnly conducted at [location]. To open the clouded paths and deliver the departed soul of [Name], I looked up, beseeching the celestial grace, that they might attain rebirth in the blessed realms. For the prayers of exorcism regarding [matter], I looked up, beseeching the celestial grace, to safeguard peace and protection.\n\nAs one charged with upholding the teachings, I could not justly refuse. Reverently following the mysterious statutes, I conducted the rites in proper sequence.\n\nI recall with dread that I have long relied upon the transforming light and vowed to spread the true wind. Leading the multitude of tasks, I aspired to hasten the dawn upon the forbidden paths; governing the Three Caverns, I pledged to expound the secrets from the jasper sac. Above, I sought to illuminate and turn the celestial chapters; below, to receive and proclaim the imperial mandate. Arraying the eight terraces, I mirrored the nine heavens. Behold the terrace of the Three Flowers, towering through kalpas, wreathed in purple mist; gaze upon the gate of the Seven Treasures, vast and sunlit, veiled in rosy clouds. Without ascending by jade decree, how could one approach the golden chambers and present memorials?\n\nWith reverence, I address the Most High, Formless and Nameless, the Void and Spontaneous, the Utmost True and Great Dao, the Supreme Primordial August One before the Golden Gates and Jade Steps. Your divine work is not self-willed; your sagely transformation knows no bounds. The azure vault resounds with empty song, illuminating the five patterns and expanding the vast; the purple void flourishes in luxuriance, dividing the three luminaries to bring forth clarity. Lofty and ever loftier, you ascend beyond all ascent.\n\nI pray that you may extend your favor at the phoenix throne and permit direct approach to the dragon [seat]. May the assembly celebrate the winds and clouds, as the ten poles gather the radiance of the numinous light; may your beneficent rain and dew shine forth, as the eight distances receive the splendor of the ancestral qi. Far and near, all receive your grace; the hidden and the manifest are bathed in your blessings. May your influence flow unceasingly through the kalpas, that I may forever support and revere the mysterious origin.\n\nI can scarcely contain my longing as I gaze toward the heavens and yearn for the sagely presence. With reverence, I present this memorial to make known my plea.\n\nI bow my head and knock my forehead in awe and trepidation, respectfully submitting these words.\n\nOn the ___ day of the ___ month, your minister [Name], holding office, humbly presents this memorial.\n\n**The Supreme Memorials of the Three Caverns, First Scroll, Concludes**\n\n**The Supreme Memorials of the Three Caverns, Second Scroll**\n\n**Memorial to Break Open Fengdu and Initiate the Dao’s Work**\n\nYour minister [Name], bowing twice with awe and trepidation, knocks his forehead to the ground, and respectfully states:\n\nI am but a worthless timber, a humble reed, fortunate by past blessings to be recklessly attached to the ranks of the true. My merits are not even as round as a grain of millet, while my transgressions accumulate like mountains and abysses. By your gracious forbearance, I have not been condemned to destruction. I vow to exert myself in cultivation, striving to repay your kindness. Having received this petition, how dare I not report it?\n\nI reverently consider the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Six Caverns and Ten Palaces, the dark passes and shadowy nights, the trials by water and fire, the bonds of life and death. Enduring bitterness through the ages, they revolve through a thousand kalpas. Though the deluded karma of sentient beings is self-inflicted, the benevolent grace of the Supreme Mystery is worthy of compassion. Without relying upon pardon and absolution, how could they attain transcendence?\n\nI humbly present a memorial, praying that it may ascend to the Three Heavens. I hope that your compassion may incline toward mercy, and that you may specially bestow the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating the ten directions and brightening the nine ramparts. May the departed [Name], together with their nine ancestors and seven generations, their kindred through countless kalpas, the six paths and four births, and all classes of hidden souls, be bathed in the wondrous qi, suddenly awaken to their true hearts, and have their karmic debts from past kalpas instantly dissolved.\n\nI respectfully invoke the Flying Celestial Messengers of the Ten Directions and the Jade Boys and Girls who deliver from suffering, to ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps before the Three Heavens, and request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s decrees, the golden registers, the white tablets, and the true talismans of deliverance. May these be proclaimed to the Three Realms of the Ten Directions, the boundless divine realms, the Offices of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the yin and yang records of transgressions, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the hundred and twenty courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the inner and outer palace caverns, the Avīci Hell and the Uninterrupted, the great and small Iron Enclosures, the twelve river sources, the Yellow Springs, the nine dark realms and five marchmounts, the lords of sin and punishment, the five sufferings and three paths, all the great hells, the Five Paths’ capital bureaus, and the underworld offices of enforcement.\n\nBy the radiance of these talismans, may the iron cities be illuminated, the torments of suffering shattered, the cangues and fetters removed, the imprisoned freed, and the furnaces and coals abolished.",

Following the established rites, we proceed with the *Muyu Yizhi Zhang* (Chapter of Bathing and Healing).\n\nThe humble servant [Name], holding this office, prostrates in awe and trepidation, kowtowing repeatedly to address this: I, a being of dust and leakage, a mere ant-like existence, dare to presume upon the ranks of those who proclaim virtue and hesitate not to undertake the canon of saving souls. May Your majestic presence, resplendent and awe-inspiring, deign to heed this plea.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty is to uphold the teachings, and reason forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this [month], I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding step by step in accordance with the true precepts.\n\nI deeply fear that the aforementioned departed souls, confined in the gloom of the nether gates, are enmeshed in the filth of yin. To achieve the clarity of their forms, they must rely on the purifying flow of divine springs. Therefore, I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, hoping for Your merciful descent. May the *qi* of the Jade Purity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure suffuse the Orchid Pool, bathing them in radiant splendor.\n\nMay the departed, [Name], along with their nine ancestral generations, seven forebears, countless karmic kin, and all beings of the six paths and four modes of birth—every shade in the hidden realms—be cleansed of miasmic obstructions, their forms and spirits purified, inner and outer realms made luminous, and not a speck of dust remaining.\n\nI humbly invoke the descent of:\n- The Jade Maiden of the Eastern Well and the Lady of the Hua Pond,\n- The Jade Maidens of Washing and Bathing, and the Lords of the Bathing Rites,\n- The Moon and Sun Lads, one each,\n- The Officers and Generals of the Five Directions for Dispelling Filth, 120 each.\n\nMay they unite and descend. Through divine transformation, may the Yellow Flower Pool of the Eastern Well and the Flowing Marsh of the Western Fields yield the sacred water of Stone Essence and Yellow Flower, the *qi* of the Five Directions, the essence of the sun and moon, the Golden Nectar of Sweet Dew, and the Cloud Fat and Jade Elixir. May these bathe the departed souls, refining their sinful dust and washing away their hindering filth. May the impurities of their knots and fetters be cleansed, and the karmic debts and afflictions of their grievances be purified.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Green Spirit Elder of the East, who nourishes with the green nectar of nine *qi*,\n- The Cinnabar Spirit Elder of the South, who nourishes with the cinnabar splendor of three *qi*,\n- The Radiant Spirit Elder of the West, who nourishes with the white pulp of seven *qi*,\n- The Dark Spirit Elder of the North, who nourishes with the dark sap of five *qi*,\n- The Yellow Spirit Elder of the Center, who nourishes with the yellow essence of one *qi*.\n\nMay they stabilize the *po* and pacify the *hun*, naturally generating the five viscera.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Vajra of a Hundred Refinements,\n- The Jade Liquid of a Thousand Harmonies,\n- The Flowing Light of Venus,\n- The Scattered Essence of the Primordial Sovereign.\n\nMay they dispel oppressive afflictions, purge turbid filth, and render body and mind pure, wisdom luminous and penetrating.\n\nI further invoke:\n- The Divine Physicians of Heaven,\n- The Numinous Officers of Medicinal Arts,\n- The Three and Five Merit Officials,\n- The Grand Masters of Medicine,\n- The Acupuncture and Stone Needle Officers,\n- The Numinous Officers of Medicinal Application.\n\nMay they secretly administer the nine-transformed magic mushrooms and five-colored divine medicines, dispersing them through the meridians and viscera to heal the ailments of their former lives’ *ying* and *wei*. May the aforementioned departed souls find their chronic illnesses pacified, deep-seated maladies cured, spirits restored, limbs purified, and receive transformation for rebirth as proof of efficacy.\n\nGreat Dao, we humbly beseech Your compassion.\nYour foolish servant, with utmost reverence, bows twice to present this petition. Following the established rites, we conclude with the *Pudu Youhun Zhang* (Chapter for the Universal Salvation of Hidden Souls).\n\nThe humble servant [Name], holding this office, prostrates in awe and trepidation, kowtowing repeatedly to address this: Though I am unworthy to stand among the ranks of the true, I strive to aid the transformation of the Dao, pledging my heart to uphold the teachings and dedicating myself to saving souls. I presume upon Your august authority, offering these humble words, though they are but a drop in the vast ocean of beings.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty is to uphold the teachings, and reason forbids refusal. Thus, beginning on the [day] of this month, I shall reverently establish a sacred altar at [location], proceeding step by step in accordance with the rites.\n\nI have witnessed the hidden paths of the nether gates, where lost souls and trapped spirits linger. Some were swept away by water or fire, others slain by weapons or treachery, crushed by trees or stones, or wounded by blades or punishments. Some suffered long from hunger and cold, or were poisoned by toxins; others were killed by bandits, devoured by snakes or tigers, executed by law, or struck by thunder. Some perished in overturned carts or fallen horses, hanged themselves, or drowned in rivers; others died in foreign lands, fell in battle, or were seized by ghosts and spirits. Some were bound by karmic grievances, or afflicted with muteness, lameness, deafness, or plagues; others died in childbirth, from illness, or by untimely fate. Some bore ancient resentments or constant sorrows, or were never freed by imperial grace or general amnesties. Countless names remain solitary and stagnant, myriad families sunk in suffering. They dwell as shadows in forests or hide as phantoms in the wilds, wandering without refuge, truly pitiable.\n\nOnly the Yellow Register reveals the grace of the Leaking Spring; the Gate of True Yin offers the moment to plead for their salvation. Though I have received the Jade Talismans and presumed upon the great amnesty, I fear my merits have not reached the hidden realms. Therefore, I follow the Dao of the Immeasurable Salvation of Beings. On the night of the [day] of this month, I shall prepare the grand offering of the Jade Mountain Pure Feast in the Mysterious Capital, summoning the departed of the nine provinces and ten realms, the six paths and four modes of birth—all manner of the injured and deceased, boundless shades and consciousnesses—to partake of the feast, receive refinement, and transcend suffering for rebirth.\n\nWithout the compassion of the Great Dao, how could these souls attain liberation? I humbly present this petition to the Three Heavens, hoping for Your merciful descent. May the *qi* of the Jade Purity and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure fill the ten directions, illuminating the nine wilds, reaching infinitely above and below. May they guide all beings to the Dharma banquet, where sins are washed away, grievances dissolved, and forms refined for transformation.\n\nI humbly invoke:\n- The Great Brahma Numinous Officers of the Jade Purity’s Vast Expanse,\n- The Salvific Numinous Officers of the Azure Mystery and Yellow Register,\n- The Merit Officials, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens, thirty-two each,\n- The Immortal Clerks, one hundred in number.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Gates and Jade Steps of the Three Heavens to request the descent of the Primordial Sovereign’s merciful and auspicious Sweet Dew, bearing the Banner of Heavenly Compassion and Amnesty. May they unite and descend, reciting incantations to sprinkle the Sweet Dew, universally transforming the feast’s measures, pervading empty space without end.

May the dark gates and shadowed paths be suffused with radiant splendor, and the earth-bound sinful souls be instantly purified. Thus may the aforementioned departed spirits emerge from the abyssal night, swiftly behold the morning sun, awaken their suffering hearts, recognize their past lives, repent their transgressions, and advance in goodness, casting off torment to transcend into new life.\n\nI reverently petition for the descent of the Talisman-Officer for Summoning Spirits and the Divine Youth for Summoning Spirits, each one, to specially invoke for the deceased [Name]. I present the Supreme Ultimate True Talisman and proclaim it to the Eastern Ultimate, within the Palace of Eternal Joy, to the Great Compassionate One, the Most High Heavenly Worthy of Salvation Who Responds to Cries, beseeching the descent of mighty divine wisdom-light to universally illuminate the ten-directional worlds. May the deepest yin’s layered prisons and the Northern Capital’s frigid pools—every dungeon within—be transformed into yang realms.\n\n**Ninefold Refinement for Ascending Immortals and Delivering Souls Memorial**\nYour subordinate [Name], trembling with awe, bows his head repeatedly and respectfully addresses: My Dao remains unconnected to the mysterious, my virtue far from the wondrous. Though I repeatedly make petitions for others, I ever chasten myself with trepidation. Looking upward, I rely on boundless grace; gazing downward, I implore lenient pardon.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a teacher forbids refusal. Beginning on the [Day] of this month, I reverently establish a sacred altar at [Location] and proceed with the rites in due order. I deeply consider that the aforementioned departed souls, long submerged in yin’s darkness, are easily severed from yang’s light. Without the refining power of the Yellow Flower, how may they ascend to the Azure Heavens and attain perfection?\n\nOn the night of [Day], I shall faithfully follow the Numinous Treasure’s Great Dharma of Limitless Salvation, unfolding the Five Scriptures and performing the Ninefold Refinement. First, I present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens. Prostrate, I beseech compassion to condescend and specially bestow the Dao-qi of Jade Clarity and the wondrous light of Numinous Treasure, pouring into the sacred altar and radiating luminous brilliance. Thus may the aforementioned departed souls bathe their bodies in divine light, cleanse their hearts of yin’s filth, refine their essences through water and fire, and perfect their inner and outer selves.\n\nI reverently petition the Southern Palace’s Heavenly Worthy of Delivering the Dead, the Southern Ultimate’s Great Lord of Longevity, the Marshal of Salvation, the Benevolent Lord Han, the Southern Superintendents of Life and Records, the Heavenly Worthies of Prolonging Life and Dispelling Calamities, the Boundless Deliverer of the Dead Who Restores Bones, and the Heavenly Lord of Delivering Souls to Ascend the Southern Palace, to inscribe the deceased [Name]’s lifespan in golden script and fix their name upon the jade tablet.\n\nFurther, I petition the Heavenly Worthy’s Salvation Officers, the Golden Palace’s Transformation Officers, the Vermilion Mound’s Life-Delivering Officers, the Carefree and Joyous Officers, the Officers of Perfect Treasure Blossom, the Numinous Treasure Officers of the Jade Bureau of Refinement and Salvation, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, Generals, Envoys, and Merit-Officials to ascend to the Golden Palace of the Three Heavens and request the descent of the Primordial Beginning’s Mandate, the Golden Register’s White Tablet, the Longevity Talisman, the Inner Sound’s Jade Characters, the Vermilion Script’s True Text, and the Yellow Register’s Treasure Proclamation of Ascension. May these descend to the altar, purifying the deceased [Name] by breaking the foulness of Fengdu and sweeping away the yin’s gloom of the Yellow Springs. May their karmic roots be severed, their sinful records burned, the Five Households flown beyond, and the Three Corpses slain. May the Dharma Bridge be erected, the cloud realms traversed. May the Well of Yellow Flower be opened, the divine court of flowing fire established. May yang’s spirits be refined, yin’s shadows dispelled, ascending to the Vermilion Palace and descending into the Realm of Radiance, restoring the myriad spirits and regenerating the Nine Qi. Clad in the vestments of celestial ascent, riding the lotus chariot, may they proceed directly to the Heavenly Gate, pay homage at the Golden Palace, roam freely and at ease, and merge with the Dao in perfection. Forever free from the sorrow of rebirth, may they ever tread the path of luminous fortune. May they swiftly attain deliverance and soon join the ranks of heaven and humanity. By the grace of the Great Dao, I humbly plead for distinction and mercy.\n\nI, your foolish subordinate, bow twice more in reverence to inform the Three Heavens.\n\n**Fengdu Pardon of Sins Memorial**\nYour subordinate [Name], trembling with awe, bows his head repeatedly and respectfully addresses: Born in this impure world, I live in an era of flourishing destiny, bearing registers and delving into the mysterious, transmitting scriptures and awakening to the Dao. I vowed to deliver others and lead the teachings, hoping to atone for faults and establish merit. For all who take refuge, how dare I forget to proclaim and inform?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, I deeply consider the Three Offices, Nine Bureaus, One Hundred Twenty Courts, Six Caves, Ten Palaces, Thirty-Six Prisons, the Boundless Iron Enclosure, the Yellow Springs’ winding depths, the Five Sufferings, Three Evil Paths, Nine Yin Realms, and Five Marchmounts—all who govern the laws and examine transgressions. The foolish masses, ignorant of right principle, accumulate karmic debts and indulge in wrongdoing. Thus, their names are bound to the Northern Fengdu, their souls confined to the dark night, imprisoned in yin’s dungeons, fettered for eternity, enduring every torment, with no means of liberation. Without the mysterious pardon of the void, how may their retribution be absolved?\n\nI respectfully present this memorial to inform the Three Heavens.",

The opening invocation and closing formula follow the precedent of the *Petition for the Salvation and Ascension of the Deceased*.\n\nYour servant, [Name], holding the humble rank of [Title], in awe and trepidation, kowtows and bows repeatedly to present this plea. By fortune’s grace, my foundational virtue was innate, and I have joyfully encountered this flourishing era. I have received the registers and advanced in rank, transmitted the scriptures and embraced the Dao. Yet I am shamed by my shallow understanding, failing to grasp the subtleties of the profound and tranquil. My transgressions have accumulated, while my merits remain threadbare. Should I be blessed by the grace of creation and sustenance, may I be entrusted with the rites of salvation and deliverance. I shall redouble my cultivation, striving to repay this boundless kindness.\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I present this petition for your consideration.

Your humble servant, in utmost sincerity, prostrates twice to make this supplication known.\n\nFollowing the precedent of the *Ritual for Purging the Blood Lake*, I, your subordinate [Name], in trembling awe, kowtow and bow my head to the ground, humbly submitting this petition. Born of dust and mire, a lowly creature of the wilds, I have presumptuously defiled the ranks of the ordained and overreached in my duty to deliver salvation. Yet, unable to repay the virtue of my creation, I vow to propagate the benevolence of transformation and nurturance. For all who take refuge, how dare I neglect this sacred duty of invocation?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, I earnestly reflect upon the deceased, so-and-so, who bears the burdens of three lives and four debts, amassing grievous transgressions; whose six desires and seven passions have readily invited calamity and fault. Their fate ensnared by the perils of childbirth, their spirit cast into the dark gates. The courts of the Northern Feng and Eastern Tai record their name; the prisons of the Gorge Crags and Blood Lake torment their form and soul. They cling to eternal sorrow, with no means of liberation.\n\nYet, considering the origin of their endowed existence—who is not but a spark of ancestral qi? Their misdeeds, self-inflicted, truly merit pity and compassion. The Emperor’s grace knows no bounds; surely, it will bestow mercy.\n\nI humbly present this memorial, beseeching the Three Heavens to deign to cast their gaze upon the depths of the Yellow Springs. May they specially descend the qi of the Jade Purity Dao and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure, illuminating all directions and piercing the long night.

May these be proclaimed to the Northern Capital, the Fengdu of the Great Iron Enclosure, the Gorge Crags, the Avīci Blood Lake Hell, that the talismanic radiance may shine forth, dispelling the darkness of the nether realms.\n\nI implore that the deceased, so-and-so, and all those imprisoned by the calamities of childbirth, be swiftly absolved of their sin registers, their evil roots eradicated, their enmities resolved, and their nature and consciousness liberated. By this talismanic decree, may they escape the paths of darkness, ascend to the sacred altar, hear the scriptures, and receive the Dharma. May their forms be restored and their essences revived, to be reborn according to their karma.\n\nMoreover, considering their defilement by blood and filth, their form and spirit tainted, they cannot approach the Three Treasures nor draw near the celestial radiance. I humbly invoke:\nOne Purification Lord of the Five Directions and Five Emperors for each direction,\ntwenty-four Jade Maiden Envoys for each,\nthe Great Generals of the Nine Phoenixes for Breaking Defilement,\nthe Great General for Purging Defilement,\nthe Great General for Washing Defilement,\nthe Great General for Eradicating Defilement,\neach accompanied by twenty-four divine officers,\nthe Lord of the Eastern Well for Bathing,\naccompanied by twenty-four divine officers,\nthe Lady of Washing and Rinsing,\nthe Yellow Flower Jade Maiden,\none hundred and twenty Flower Maidens of the Immortals.\n\nMay they descend together, drawing the divine waters of the Yellow Flower, the refined essence of the corpse, the golden nectar of sweet dew, and the jade liqueur of cloud marrow, infusing them into the orchid-scented bath. May they bathe the deceased, so-and-so, washing away the pollution of childbirth and purging the filth of blood. May their inner and outer selves be illumined, their form and spirit purified, their roots, dust, and karmic grime all cleansed and clarified.\n\nFurthermore, considering the deceased’s final moments, wracked by pain and poison, their vital essence and protective qi depleted, their recovery incomplete, I humbly invoke:\nOne Divine Clerk of Celestial Medicine,\nOne Numinous Officer of the Imperial Pharmacy,\nOne Merit Clerk for Healing,\nOne Grand Master of Medicine.\n\nMay they descend together, secretly employing their divine and sagely arts, administering the essence of the sun and moon, the jade mushrooms and golden elixirs, the five-colored divine cinnabar. May they heal all afflictions, that yin and Yang may flow unimpeded, blood and qi harmonized, meridians restored to their origin, and soul and spirit clarified and rectified. May they ascend to the heavens to receive the precepts and be reborn among humans or gods, forever freed from the fear of descent, dwelling in the realm of boundless light.\n\nMay the radiant brilliance of the Numinous Treasure extend its beneficence far and wide, calming the waves of the sea of karma and stilling the tides of the Blood Lake. May all people and creatures receive the gift of life. May the sun of transformation shine upon the Three Paths, and the winds of benevolence spread to the eight directions.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion.

      "translated_text": "**Chapter on Transmuting the Corpse to Attain Immortality Through Liberation**\n\nYour humble servant, [Name], in utmost reverence and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates twice, and respectfully submits this memorial:\n\nBy the grace of karmic affinity, I have presumptuously assisted in the wondrous transformation. I have vowed to widely propagate salvation and humbly contribute to the work of creation. Yet my transgressions run deep as abysses, while my merits are thinner than a hair. I earnestly implore Your boundless compassion to overlook my failings.\n\nYour servant reverently states: My late master, [Name], during his lifetime bore the [Scripture Name], received the [Register Name], upheld the [Dharma Name], and served in the [Office Name], diligently cultivating the Dao in the [Oratory Name]. Though a novice with shallow understanding and unfulfilled immortal rank, he could not transcend the earth to soar through the heavens. Having met his liberation in the year [Year], month [Month], and day [Day], he passed through the Great Yin at the age of [Age]. In accordance with the *Three Caverns’ Rites of Immortal Liberation*, his garments, pillow, and mat were inscribed with sacred talismans to protect his corporeal form. Further, following the *Precious Scripture of the Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*, jade-script true writs were installed in the five directions to safeguard his spirit. A propitious day was chosen for his interment, entrusting his form to the earthly palace.\n\nYet I fear that in his lifetime, his merits and virtues were incomplete, hindering his transcendence. Thus, on the [Day] of this month, I humbly establish at [Location] the *Exalted Retreat of the Numinous Treasure’s Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*, lasting two days and nights. May it serve to support, guide, and escort my late master [Name], restoring his form to receive new life and roam the vast heavens.\n\nAs a servant of the Golden Portal, my bond with my master was as deep as that between father and son. Overwhelmed by grief, I follow the true precepts and proceed in due order. I reflect that the Three Bureaus, Nine Offices, One Hundred Twenty Departments, the luminous statutes of the Four Poles, and the Three Caverns’ disciplinary codes shine like the sun and moon, their authority as mighty as thunder. Those who study the Dao and seek truth easily incur transgressions. Without pardon, they must descend to the dark realms—this dreadful prospect fills me with trembling dread.\n\nMy late master [Name] was born in an auspicious era and revered the Mysterious Origin. Yet he had not fully grasped the methods of cultivating truth and harnessing the radiant spirits, though he harbored the aspiration to benefit others and the world. At the sacred festivals of the year, he often violated the precepts. In his progression through the scriptures, registers, and ranks, his audience with the Perfected was incomplete. Moreover, his frequent memorials and petitions may have disturbed the divine officials, leading the Dark Records to inscribe his transgressions. Unresolved yang faults and unatoned yin offenses hastened his departure from this world, plunging him into the depths of desolation.\n\nWere it not for the boundless compassion of the Great Dao, how could later disciples swiftly ascend to the celestial realms? I respectfully present this memorial to the Three Heavens, beseeching the Supreme Saints to bestow mercy, and the Most Perfect to show pity. May they descend the qi of the Jade Clarity Dao and the wondrous light of the Numinous Treasure to envelop my late master’s soul, spirit, and corporeal form, erasing his transgressions, dissolving his trials, and allowing him to ascend directly to the Void along the light and qi.\n\nI further petition that the Ten Directions and Three Realms, along with all divine administrations, be notified to pardon all his past and present transgressions—whether of the three karmas, six emotions, or those incurred since he began studying the Dao—releasing him from all faults, transferring his name to the Purple Register, and granting him rebirth through transformation.\n\nI humbly invoke:\n- Three *Lingbao* Officials for Eradicating Evil Paths, each with 120 generals and officers;\n- Four Officials for Severing Earthly Roots, each with 120 generals and officers;\n- Five Officials for Flying Beyond Karmic Bonds, each with 120 generals and officers.\n\nMay they descend as one to eradicate the three evils, sever earthly roots, and transcend the five karmic bonds for my late master [Name], inscribing his name in the Great Mystery, ascending in radiance to the formless realm. If his soul has fallen into the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Six Heavens, or Nine Dark Realms, may he be liberated and ascend to the highest realms.\n\nI further invoke:\n- Twelve Envoys of the Golden Dragon Post of the Mysterious Capital;\n- One Heavenly Merit Officer of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Flower;\n- Ten Flying Heavenly Envoys of the Ten Directions, each with 120 generals and officers.\n\nMay they ascend to the Golden Portal beneath the Jade Throne of the Three Heavens to request the descent of:\n- The Primordial Beginning’s Mandate;\n- The Golden Register and White Tablet;\n- The Longevity Talisman;\n- The Nine-Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Flower Azure Palace;\n- The True Talisman for Ascending to Perfection and Escaping the Cycle of Birth and Death;\n- The Precious Edict of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace.\n\nMay these be proclaimed to the Three Bureaus, Nine Offices, Five Emperors, and Four Administrations, along with the countless yin tribunals. If my late master’s public or private transgressions remain unresolved, may they be pardoned through this immortal liberation merit. If his offenses bind him to his three generations of ancestors, nine lineages of kin, or karmic adversaries in the unseen realms, may his past virtuous deeds be recorded, swiftly securing his pardon. May his sinful records be altered, his name inscribed on the Jade Tablet, his spirit promoted in rank, and his steps elevated to the celestial thoroughfares.\n\nI further invoke the Nine Heavens, Thirty-Two Heavens, Five Venerable Lords, the administrations of all heavens, the Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets, and the divine hosts of the celestial bureaus. May they each descend their true qi to guide my late master [Name], cleansing his faults and elevating him to the Dao realm. May he resume his office, his qi entering the Mysterious Mystery, attaining rank and perfection, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth.\n\nMoreover, I pray that the true spirits and deities of [Mountain Name] under [Peak Name], along with the Nine Earth Officials, each within their jurisdictions, protect my late master’s corporeal form. May disasters be averted, his tomb remain tranquil, his form secure, his spirit guarded, and his po never rise. May they hold the tally and match the talisman, reviving his bones and flesh, uniting form and spirit. May he roam and ascend, attaining immortality, fully in accordance with the *Five Transmutations for Liberating the Corpse to Generate Immortality*. May he forever uphold the mysterious grace as a token of gratitude.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion.",

      "translated_text": "The humble servant, with utmost reverence, prostrates twice to make this solemn report. The concluding rites follow the precedent of the *Chapter on Delivering the Immortal Soul Beyond the Mundane*, as follows:\n\nYour servant, [Name], in trepidation and awe, bows his head to the ground, prostrates again, and respectfully submits: though unworthy, I stand in the ranks of the martial and have presumptuously assumed the office of salvation, undeservedly granted grace beyond my station, humbled by the knowledge of my own limitations. I vow to magnify the benevolence of the Cavernous Assistance and secretly aid the virtue of creation and transformation. I humbly beseech the vast generative power to look down upon my sincere devotion.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this fast, my duty as a master of the teachings permits no refusal. I deeply reflect that [Name], by fortunate karmic affinity, has received the shelter of the mysterious shade, worn the registers, upheld the laws, studied the scriptures, and learned the truths. Yet, entangled in the dusty world, he has not grasped the subtleties of the esoteric. In establishing fasts and setting forth offerings, he has often transgressed against dignity; in bowing to present petitions and memorials, he has truly failed in propriety. Breaking fasts and violating precepts, indulging in karma and following his desires, he has frequently lost harmony with Heaven and often succumbed to human cravings. On the Three Primes and Five La, he has not diligently attended the morning audience of the perfected; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen, he has never performed repentance or offered thanks. His transgressions are recorded in the Black Register, his name listed in the offices of the mysterious. He has not achieved liberation while seated nor forgotten the self to ascend in spirit. Directing qi and performing the rites for extinction, his body has passed through the Great Yin, his rise or fall unknowable, swiftly enduring months and fortnights.\n\nThe filial son says: Your servant’s bond as father and child runs deep, his heart overwhelmed with grief and dread.\nThe disciple says: Your servant’s duty as teacher and friend is profound, his heart overwhelmed with grief and dread.\n\nWere it not for the compassion of the Most High Sages and the protection of the exalted perfected, who might look down in pity upon our ignorance and mightily grant their covering grace, how could his past transgressions be cleansed and new blessings be guided and welcomed? Therefore, not measuring my own presumption, I humbly present this memorial, one document, to report to the Three Heavens. I prostrate in hope that the great compassion will bend to perfect, the utmost benevolence extend without limit, and a special edict be issued, dispatched to the ten directions, the three realms, and all relevant jurisdictions, to pardon all transgressions of [Name] since the beginning of kalpas and after his birth. May he be transferred to the Azure Palace of the Registers of Destiny, his name moved to the Vermilion Mansion, his form and spirit harmoniously merged, his qi and appearance perfectly rounded. Following the merit of my teachings, may his achievements be assessed and rewards bestowed, his office restored, his qi entering the Mysterious Mystery. May he become a saintly lord of the Golden Towers.\n\nMay your servant greatly propagate the sagely transformation, the karmic fortune unbroken, and attain the body of an immortal, roaming carefree in the Highest Clarity, forever freed from the cycle of rebirth. With reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao, beseeching its compassion.",

The conclusion follows the precedent of the *Petition to Sever Karmic Entanglements*. Your subject, [Name], in trembling awe, kowtows and bows again to submit:\n\nBy nature dull and ignorant, my talents meager, I yet stand in the ranks of the ordained, vowing to deliver all beings through the extension of boundless compassion. How dare I neglect to report those who seek refuge under my care?\n\nIn accordance with the intent of this ritual, I humbly observe that the aforementioned departed soul, throughout its earthly existence, indulged in karmic transgressions without restraint or self-discipline. After departing this world, it bears the weight of accumulated offenses, sinking into the depths of suffering. Drifting through the Three Wretched Realms, tossed amid the Five Afflictions, it clings to its attachments, never aspiring to transcendence. Its kin and relatives all suffer contagion; its household, young and old, faces ruin. Seeking a substitute proves impossible, and so the cycle of karmic entanglement continues unbroken. Such profound suffering truly merits compassion. Without the salvific power of the Mysterious Dao, how could this benighted soul attain peace?\n\nI respectfully present this petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching Your boundless compassion to bestow special grace. May the qi of the Jade Clarity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure illuminate the Nine Springs and brighten the dark tombs. May the departed [Name] awaken to right mindfulness, repent of past causes, and recognize former errors, thereby seeking ascent. May its lingering entanglements be severed forever, sparing further affliction.\n\nI humbly invoke the following divine hosts to descend:\n- **Shi’an Jun**, **Du Xing Jun**, **Zhu Yang Jun**, **Du Ping Jun**, **Shuo Ping Jun**, **Tian Xuan Jun**, **Shi Xian Jun**, **Gao Du Jun**, **Duan [ ] Jun**, and **Hui Hua Jun** (ten in total);\n- **Tian Yi Bo Shi** and **Shan Tan Da Fu** (one each);\n- **Officers and generals**, 120 each;\n- **Chu Yang Jun**, **Tian Chang Jun**, **Yuan Shang Gao Cang Jun**, and **Zhong Guan Zuo Du Hou Jun** (one each), with **soldiers**, 10,000 each;\n- **Su Che Bai Ma Jun** (one), with **clerks and soldiers**, 100,000;\n- **Can Xing Jiang Jun**, **Tai Bai Bing Xing Ying Huo Li**, **Tie Mian Gan Jian Shi Gui Li Shi**, **Tian Zou Jia Zu**, and **clerks, soldiers, officers, and generals**—may they all descend together to exhort the departed on behalf of the ritual sponsor [Name], resolving tomb disputes, dissolving all attachments, and severing karmic entanglements.\n\nI further invoke:\n- **Duan Zhu Da Jiang Jun** and **Duan Shi Da Jiang Jun** (one each), with **officers, generals, and soldiers**, 100,000;\n- **Jiu Tian Bu Qi Jiang**, **Gan Lu Jiang**, and **Hu Ming Jiang** (one each), with **officers and generals**, 32 each—may they descend together to safeguard against future illness and suffering, severing the karmic entanglements of the departed. May [Name]’s form and soul find ease, the tomb remain undisturbed, and all summons or disputes be effortlessly resolved. May sins be absolved, and the soul ascend to transcendence, forever escaping the darkness of the netherworld.\n\nMay the ritual sponsor [Name], along with all kin, relatives, and household members, rejoice in carefree bliss, forever freed from contagion. May their spirits be at peace, their vital forces harmonized, and may they enjoy wealth, longevity, health, and tranquility as a sign of this covenant.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao and humbly beseech its compassion.

Commencing the \"Proclamation to the Mysterious Vault\" chapter:\n\nI, your humble servant [Name], in trepidation and reverence, bow my head to the ground, prostrate myself, and bow twice again in supplication. I, undeserving, have received the profound grace of the Dao, presumptuously assuming the ranks of the true, looking up to its nurturing transformation and bearing deep gratitude below. I aspire to extend the boundless generosity of the ever-generating Way and humbly aid the profound benevolence of its ceaseless transformation. My entreaties have been earnest, and I dare not delay in making this report.\n\nIn accordance with the intent of the ritual, I, your servant, deeply consider the site where the altar is to be erected. Since the ashes of kalpas past, yin impurities have congealed, wandering miasmas have sealed the four directions, dust and haze have flowed and settled, and murky filth has flown and spread. Without the power of purification and release, how can the veneration of the mysterious and true be made solemn? Moreover, with residual qi intermingling and beings flourishing in profusion, it is fitting to dissolve and cleanse, that purity may be wholly preserved.\n\nI respectfully present this memorial, one document, to be heard by the Three Heavens. Humbly I beseech that great compassion be bestowed with grace, that the transformative power of the Dao descend in particular. May the qi of the Jade Purity and the wondrous radiance of the Numinous Treasure illumine above the clouds and mists, and shine below upon the wind-formed ramparts, so that the ten flowers and eight extremities are all pervaded with luminous clarity. May the ritual altar thus established be bathed in numinous light, not a speck of dust remaining, its interior and exterior fused in purity, sacred mushrooms spontaneously growing.\n\nI respectfully invoke the descent of the Lords of Purification from the Five Directions and Five Emperors, each one, along with 120 official generals, bearing the Five Harmonies Fragrant Springs and the true essence of dharma-water, to descend together, washing and purifying the numinous altar, dissolving and removing all defilements and impurities.\n\nOne thousand two hundred Jade Maidens of Immortal Flowers, along with the Nine Phoenixes from the *Lu of Breaking Impurities*, and the Great Generals of Transporting Impurities, Resolving Impurities, Gathering Impurities, Repelling Impurities, Eliminating Impurities, Severing Impurities, Washing Impurities, and Sweeping Impurities—one from each category—together with 120 official generals each, and the Water-Mastering Dragon Lords of the Five Directions, descend as one to cleanse and purify all implements, vessels, and structures prepared for the ritual, so that halls and dwellings may all attain clarity, utterly free of residual defilement.\n\nFurthermore, I invoke the descent of the Talisman Clerks of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, and the Youths of Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits, each one, bearing the *Highest Perfected Jade Purity King of Descending Perfection Talismanic Mandate* and the *Primal August Summoning Spirits Talismanic Mandate*, to proclaim to the Three Realms, whistle forth commands to the Ten Directions, dispatch and employ the thousand spirits, and ally with the ten thousand sages, safeguarding the altar’s precepts and rectifying the ritual’s efficacy from beginning to end, that no obstacles or hindrances arise.\n\nMay it further be decreed that the command be issued to the Mysterious Altar to receive its charge, and to the offices, bureaus, courts, and departments of the Numinous Treasure Immortal Administration, along with their lords, generals, and clerks, to descend in accordance with the servant’s invocation, jointly aiding the great rectification. Thus may the ritual sponsor [Name]’s virtuous fruits be fully realized, auspicious omens secretly bestowed, the grace received today flowing into future lives. When the altar is dispersed and the merits declared, may the covenant not be betrayed.\n\nWith reverence, I contemplate the boundless Dao and humbly beseech its compassion.

From lower grades to higher grades, may they swiftly escape the wheel of retribution; from action-bound existence to the realm of non-action, may they ever dwell in purity and order.\n\nI further pray that Your benevolence extend universally, reaching as countless as the sands of the river.\n\nReverently contemplating the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of Joyous Freedom, whose body embodies the Dao at the dawn of transformation, whose spirit condenses beyond all things. You transcend the subtlest of subtleties, abiding serenely in the highest of heavens. Your merit pervades the hidden darkness, Your grace blankets the cycles of life and death. Humbly I beseech You to illumine the sun and moon, to ride the winds and clouds, delivering these departed souls from their evil destinies. May they rejoice in the realm of eternal spring, wander freely in the land of endless day. May the karmic kin of countless kalpas all attain liberation at once.\n\nReverently contemplating the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthy of Perfect Floral Brilliance, whose merit fulfills the Six Perfections, whose Dao realizes the Three Vehicles. Your countenance is majestic and dignified, Your blessings and wisdom complete. Only through utmost sincerity may one move You; truly Your vast salvation knows no bounds. Humbly I beseech You to bend Your compassionate mercy, to broadly extend skillful means, that heavenly light may shine below and the earthly prisons be opened. May the departed consciousness transcend mortality, relying on the merit of this fast to attain higher grades. May they be nurtured in the Hall of Radiant Yang, ascending to the Court of Great Possession. I further pray that Your remaining blessings subtly support their descendants.\n\nThe resplendent talismans of the Nine Heavens’ Emperors are appended below.\n\nYour humble servant, [Name], bows reverently and respectfully submits this memorial:\n\nI humbly observe that the Two Modes nurture all beings, and the thousand truths all converge in the Three Fields; that the Nine *qi* gather to form the body, and the ten thousand images array themselves in the Six Repositories. When the hundred meridians are harmonious and flowing, the seven apertures open unimpeded, the *po* is tranquil, the *hun* is serene, the spirit is clear, and the *qi* is refreshed. I now, on behalf of the disciples of [Place], present this altar petition, beseeching on behalf of the deceased [Name] to release their grievances, absolve their sins, wash away their filth, and purify their dust, that they may awaken to their original source and distinguish purity from impurity.\n\nWe, Your servants, have performed the fast and practiced the Dao, issuing talismans and decrees to extinguish sins, break through the darkness, transmit talismans, and confer precepts. We grant the register of the local Heavenly Court, bestow the talisman for transcending life and death, and make offerings to the ten directions, invoking the assembly of sages.\n\nYet I still fear that the departed soul, having committed sins in life and accumulated transgressions in death, may have sunk into evil destinies or risk falling into the wheel of rebirth—transforming their form and changing their body, never again to regain human form. I, having received from my master the Ninefold Refinement talismans, am permitted to deliver the sunken and lost. Diligently following the ritual codes, I reverently invoke the Primordial Harmonious Wondrous *qi* to entwine the deceased soul, that they may inwardly glow and outwardly shine, their essence harmonizing with heaven and earth, once more attaining human or heavenly rebirth and attending the court of the Most High.\n\nMay they, by the day, undergo refinement, and by the hour, ascend in rank. I respectfully submit this memorial, addressing the Emperor of the Boundless Joyous Heaven. Humbly I await Your heavenly compassion, that You may deign to grant this petition, uphold the talismanic decree, and specially bestow the Primordial Yellow Effulgent *qi*, coiling ninefold around their spiritual womb, that the womb-origin of the deceased [Name] may be unobstructed, ascending to heaven for regeneration, and thus regain the path of human life.\n\nI am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Reverently bowing twice, I respectfully submit this memorial. The subsequent eight memorials follow the same form, only changing the names of the deities addressed.",
