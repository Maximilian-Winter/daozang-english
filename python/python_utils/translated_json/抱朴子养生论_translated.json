  "full_translation": "*The Master Embracing Simplicity’s Treatise on Nurturing Life*\n\n*The Master Embracing Simplicity* states: The body of a single person is like the image of a kingdom. The arrangement of chest and abdomen resembles palaces and halls; the placement of limbs and trunk, the outskirts and borders; the division of bones and joints, the hundred officials; the interstices of the skin, the four thoroughfares. The spirit is like the ruler, blood like the ministers, and qi like the people. Thus, the perfected person who governs the body is like the enlightened sovereign who governs the state. Loving the people ensures the stability of the kingdom; cherishing qi ensures the wholeness of the body. When the people are exhausted, the state perishes; when qi declines, the body withers. Therefore, the perfected person and superior scholar administer medicine *before* illness arises, not pursuing remedies *after* decay has set in. Thus do they know that life is difficult to preserve yet easy to scatter, and qi is difficult to purify yet easy to pollute. If one can discern the subtleties of opportunity, one may restrain desires and safeguard life.\n\nMoreover, those skilled in nurturing life first eliminate the six harms before they can prolong their years to a hundred. What are these six? First, diminish the pursuit of fame and profit; second, forbid indulgence in sound and beauty; third, refrain from coveting wealth; fourth, reduce rich flavors; fifth, eradicate deceit and falsehood; sixth, abandon envy and resentment. If these six are not removed, the path of cultivation is but an empty gesture. Though one may not yet perceive its benefits, even if the heart yearns for the wondrous Dao, the mouth recites the true scriptures, the essence is savored, and the celestial images are inhaled and exhaled, it cannot compensate for life’s brevity. Truly, to abandon the root and neglect the branches is deeply lamentable.\n\nThus, to preserve harmony and wholeness of the true self, one must: think little, contemplate little, laugh little, speak little, rejoice little, anger little, delight little, sorrow little, desire little, detest little, engage in few affairs, and scheme little. For excessive thought scatters the spirit; excessive contemplation wearies the heart; excessive laughter inverts the organs; excessive speech depletes the sea of qi; excessive joy invites guest winds into the bladder; excessive anger causes blood to surge through the interstices; excessive delight leads the heart-spirit astray; excessive sorrow withers the head and emaciates the bones; excessive desire exhausts the will and qi; excessive detestation causes the essence-spirit to flee; excessive affairs dry and strain the sinews; excessive scheming plunges the intellect into confusion. These erode life more severely than axes, and harm life more fiercely than wolves.\n\nAvoid prolonged sitting, prolonged walking, prolonged gazing, and prolonged listening. Do not force eating when not hungry, nor force drinking when not thirsty. Forcing food when not hungry wearies the spleen; forcing drink when not thirsty distends the stomach. The body should be kept in constant, moderate motion, and food intake should be consistently light. Do not over-exert, nor allow hunger to take hold. In winter, do not leave the stomach empty at dawn; in summer, do not eat to satiety at night. Rise before the cock’s crow in the morning, and do not sleep past sunrise. When the mind is serene, the true spirit guards its place; when qi is settled, perverse influences depart the body. Deceit saddens the spirit; contention disheartens it. To slight others invites misfortune; to harm living things shortens one’s years. Performing one good deed gladdens the hun-spirit; committing one evil act delights the po-spirit. The po-spirit rejoices in death, while the hun-spirit favors life. Abide always in magnanimity and tranquility, guarding simplicity and contentment, and the body will remain at peace, untouched by calamity. The Register of Life records one’s name; the Ledger of Death erases one’s faults.\n\nThe principles of nurturing life are exhausted herein. As for refining the returning elixir to replenish the brain or transmuting golden liquid to retain the spirit—these are the wondrous practices of the highest immortals, not the path for those who consume grains and partake of blood. Among ten thousand, few attain it; truly, it is deeply lamentable.\n\nLord Lao said: Those who preserve this Dao—superior practitioners perfect it to extend life, middling practitioners cultivate it partially to avoid illness, inferior practitioners practice it intermittently to escape premature death, while fools lose the Dao and waste their nature. Is this not what is meant?\n\n*Thus concludes The Master Embracing Simplicity’s Treatise on Nurturing Life.*\n\n#1 \"Love\" (*ài*): In the *Inner Chapters of the Master Embracing Simplicity*, it is written as \"nurturing\" (*yǎng*).",
