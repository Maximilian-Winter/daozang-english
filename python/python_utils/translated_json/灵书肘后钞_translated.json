  "full_translation": "*The Ling Shu Zhaohou Chao*\n\nThe Scripture of Ling Shu Zhaohou. Author unknown. One scroll. Based on the text from *Zhengtong Daozang*, Orthodox Section, Part One.\n\nThe *Ling Shu Zhaohou Chao* states:\n\nWhen the Three Origins attain the Five Numbers, this is the command of the One General. Each of the Three Generals attains the Five Numbers—three times five makes fifteen. Above, they grasp the Five Directions; at the center, they penetrate the Five Viscera; below, they govern the Five Peaks. Moreover, above, they connect with the Three Heavens; at the center, they stabilize the Three Hun; below, they seize the Three Bureaus. Furthermore, above, they assist the Three Honored Ones; at the center, they govern the Three Gates; below, they sever the Three Thieves. Above, they lead the Three Ding—Spirits of Heaven, Immortals, and Gods. At the center, they activate the Five Stars; below, they command the Hundred Spirits.\n\nAgain, above, they sever the Five Demons; at the center, they govern the Five Essences—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The Five Essences are the essences of the Five Stars. Each day, the Lords of the Five Stars dispatch the Five Essences, which descend in accordance with the days of Earth, Wood, and the rest, bringing calamities and malevolent spirits. These appear at night as luminous stars. Below, they repel the Five Weapons—this is the essential formula of the Three-Five Revolving Jade Mechanism. Practicing this for three thousand days, one ascends in broad daylight.\n\nIf treating illness, first visualize General Tang emerging from the left kidney. Initially half an inch in length, he reaches the radiant land between the brows. The grass grows an inch away from the radiance; on the left side of the body, he grows to eight feet and one inch. If in mountains, grasses, crossroads, rivers, or seas, he grows to eighty-one *zhang*. In his left hand, he holds a tally; at his waist, a sword and talisman. He guards the left side of one’s body. Any malevolent ghosts or spirits are all seized, slain, and dispersed.\n\nGeneral Ge emerges from the right kidney; General Zhou emerges from the heart. If paying homage to an emperor, first visualize them emerging to follow—do not invoke them recklessly without cause. In the midst of battle, if outnumbered and fearing death, immediately visualize the names of the Three Generals, and through this visualization, a canopy of combat shields the body, rendering one invisible to others. If leading troops into battle, face forward and offer libations to the Three Generals, constantly visualizing them holding tallies, wielding swords, and grasping talismans to strike the enemy—thus, the foe will be utterly routed.\n\nThe Three Deputy Generals of Heaven are the Three Origins’ Generals Li, Huang, and Wang, who execute decapitation and slaying in this method. The Upper Three Origins’ Dao must not be disclosed to others. In practicing the Dao, one must know the incantation of the Five Stars that guard the body.\n\nEach day recite it twice—this guards the body with radiant luster, dispels the perverse and enters the upright. At any moment of doubt, invoke it. This is the *Guardian Spirit Incantation*.\n\nWhen establishing an altar to summon and examine spirits, one may only rescue a single person at a time before treating another. Lest ghosts cause confusion and disorder, this is called *guarding the One*. The ways of ghosts, spirits, and demonic forces are repelled by guarding the One.\n\nThe Most High said: Proceed with unwavering focus on the Dao, and ghosts will naturally stand in awe.\n\nThose who bear the *Register of the Nine Provinces’ Earthly Deities* must pass by spirit shrines with reverence—these will welcome you with bows and see you off. Do not mar your Dao with words of anger.\n\nZhao Hou, styled Ruǐ, studied the Dao from childhood. For his many punishments of ghosts, he served as the overseer of summons and examinations for three thousand years.\n\nFor all secret incantations, recite them daily, ensuring no one hears. The incantation reads:\n*\"Supreme Immortals, Supreme Spirits,\nGuard my longevity.\nLet the hundred ghosts keep far away,\nLet the ten thousand spirits all proceed.\nRevolve around my body,\nAnd unite with the Dao to form completion.\"*\n\nWhen restraining ghosts and spirits, do not detain them for long. If prolonged restraint is necessary, set a time limit. For grave offenses, only suppression and execution are permitted. To violate this is not the Way of cultivating the body.\n\nIf someone does not believe in the Dao yet seeks to punish you, write their name on a *Six Ren Talisman*, cast it into a deep place, and they will submit of their own accord.\n\nFor cold-induced illness, expel it with a *he* (呵); for heat, with a *blow* (吹); for liver ailments, with a *xu* (嘘); for lung ailments, with a *xi* (呬); for spleen ailments, with a *hu* (呼); for kidney ailments, with a *blow* (吹).\n\nHeaven’s qi is one qi; thunder’s qi is one qi; the sun and moon’s qi is one qi.\n\nTo receive Heaven’s qi, do so on the first day of the first month at the second watch of the fifth night watch. Clench your fists, face east, and walk straight ahead, ascending three steps. These three steps follow the *ding* character of the *Big Dipper’s* alignment. As the immortals say: *Stepping the Dipper* is the art of cloud-walking. *Straight* means upward.\n\nHold your breath, clench your fists, and recite the incantation:\n*\"Qian, origin;亨, smooth;利, beneficial;贞, upright.\nThe Six Jia spirits accompany me.\nI receive Heaven’s qi,\nTo govern the body and dispel toxins,\nBoth within and without, all is perfected.\nInternally, it eliminates the hundred diseases of the body;\nExternally, it gathers and subdues the hundred spirits.\nIt pacifies households and saves people,\nConcealing all toxins in form.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nAfter reciting, inhale qi according to the directions: nine from the east, three from the south, seven from the west, five from the north, and twelve from the center. After five days, you may also treat others by blowing to cure toxins, swelling, and pain. How much more so for oneself?\n\nTo receive the qi of Thunder Duke, do so on the day of the first *Awakening of Insects* each year, when the first thunderclap sounds. Step out, clench your fists, and face it. Recite the incantation:\n*\"I receive the qi of Thunder Duke,\nThe mighty voice of Thunder Mother,\nTo expel the myriad toxins within my body,\nSo all people may be treated and their forms restored.\nI command the generals of the Five Phases,\nThe soldiers of the directional methods,\nTo sever the hundred diseases,\nAnd blow out the ten thousand spirits.\nSwiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!\"*\n\nThen suppress them. Inhale nine breaths through the nose, ten through the mouth, and swallow them in one gulp. After three days, you may blow to cure all diseases, and they will vanish as soon as spoken. Perform this yearly, and its efficacy will be greatly verified each year.\n\nReceive it at the first thunder; if heard while lying down, receive it then as well. Whether walking or sitting, follow the method accordingly. In urgent cases, receive it upon hearing any thunder, and it will yield minor efficacy. Yet it is not as potent as receiving it at the first thunder each year. Within three years, treating others’ ailments will bring swift recovery, toxins will be expelled, and its efficacy will be proven without reliance on written texts.\n\nThe words of the directional methods: *Exhaling saves others; inhaling stabilizes the self.* Thus, it is called *exhalation and inhalation*.\n\nThe *Three Talismans for Ingesting Qi* are found in the *Method of Pacifying Spirits in the Numinous Officials*.\n\nThe Dao of seeking immortality and longevity:\n1. Upon receiving talismans and registers, establish the spirits of the body, ascend the *Register of Life*, erase the *Record of Death*, command the Six Jia, and restrain the Three Officials. Internally, cultivate the body; externally, save others.\n2. Ingest talismans and carry memorials to suppress evil and pacify the mind, strengthen the meridians and solidify the organs, communicate with immortals, and employ ghosts to protect people.\n3. Dispel corpse impurities and stagnation, preserve complexion, and stabilize the spirit.\n4. Submit petitions and memorials to transcend disasters, avert misfortune, extend life, retain the spirit, release prisoners, and execute talismans to attain longevity.\n5. Offer libations to immortals to seek communion with Heaven and Earth, subdue evil, dissolve calamities, resolve imprisonment, and burn documents to erase the *Record of Death*.\n6. Employ incantations and arts to uphold scriptures and methods, jointly aiding the declining kalpa, internally pacifying body and mind, and externally saving people and beings.\n\nThese six practices unite the immortal. The Most High said: Those who master the six connections are called *immortals*, though they have not yet ascended to Heaven. While in the world, they undergo a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes. The Three Officials do not harm them; the Five Ladles support them. They capture ghosts, save people, subdue demons, expel perverse forces, execute talismans, and destroy temples—all accomplished at once. If they keep these secrets and further cultivate, they will later enter the ranks of divine immortals. Yet if they flaunt their powers, boast of celestial portents, recklessly summon right and wrong, peddle methods widely, or gather crowds to lecture and discuss, the Three Officials will despise them, surely report to the Most High, leak Heaven’s mechanisms, lose the Dao, and die.\n\nThe *Five Star Fungi* number five: one is visible, four are not. The visible one is the radiance of the fungus. Observe the star of the season: spring, summer, autumn, and winter each govern one of the Five Stars. Follow the season to observe the star’s radiance. If it is bright and pure, its essence and qi are flourishing.\n\nFace the star, close your mouth, block your nose, exhale, and click your teeth twenty-four times while clenching your fists. Visualize the seasonal star entering your nostrils and mouth, then turn it around and send it into your mouth. Use the original qi and golden nectar to guide it, inhaling nine times toward the east. After a moment, exhale the starlight, transforming it into the Seven Stars, which you wear upon your head.\n\nNext, align with the Dipper—whether three, two, one, four, or five ladles—all are internal practices. The scripture says: *Swallow one star, wear five ladles.* There are also the *Crosswise Dipper*, *Seated Dipper*, *Reclining Dipper*, *Hanging Dipper*, *Reverse Dipper*, and *Forward Dipper*—seven types in total, all for cultivating the body. They subdue all perverse forces, the hundred ghosts, thousand spirits, ten thousand numina, lower officials, stale qi, and evil thoughts—all will be dissolved.\n\nConsuming this enables one to ascend and commune with the Starry River, discerning the omens of heaven and earth’s calamities and transformations, the signs of fortune and misfortune in wind and water, and the outcomes of success or failure—all revealed by the essence of the stars. Should one practice and ingest the talismans of the Six Jia, regardless of year, month, or day, this is the Way of stabilizing the body, governing the viscera, and attaining longevity.\n\nIf there is an afflicted area, follow the *Containing Shadow Diagram* to select the appropriate talisman and affix it. This is called \"externally subduing ghosts and spirits,\" and within three days, the ailment will be cured. Internally, one may also harmonize with the talisman, and all illnesses will naturally dissipate.\n\nIn stabilization, one must constantly visualize the Seven Stars worn upon the head and beneath the feet, whether sitting crosswise or reclining. The \"stabilizer\" refers to suspending them at the forehead. \"Wearing upon the head and beneath the feet\" means walking the Four Cardinal Steps. The *Crosswise Dipper* rests upon the chest. The *Seated Dipper* is as if wearing the Dipper’s ascent. The *Reclining Dipper* resembles a standing person. The *Moving Dipper* has a diagram that follows. Internally, one visualizes the stars, which is largely the same as the external practice.\n\n**Yu’s Steps:**\nWith the right breath held, first step with the left foot, ensuring three steps and nine traces, with no fixed length between strides—adjust according to the altar’s size. If the altar is large, perform the Seven Stars’ *Ding*-shaped steps, which consist of seven *Ding* steps; any deviation from the *Ding* form is incorrect. If the steps do not reach the corners, simply proceed as usual, circling the altar. Whether for grand or minor rites, there is no need to previously establish a boundary. Once the boundary is set, hold water in the left hand and a sword in the right. At the northwest corner of the seat, stir the water three times with the sword. Then recite the incantation again:\n\n*\"Essence of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, enter this water. All hundred kinds of malevolent ghosts, swiftly flee ten thousand leagues—those who do not shall be slain!\"*\n\n*Hasten, as the law commands!*\n\nThen step away from the seat and spray the water. Recite another incantation:\n\n*\"Generals who slay evil, envoys who capture ghosts, drive away and repel—let no ghostly beings or perverse spirits dare approach!\"*\n\n*Hasten, as the law commands!*\n\nAt night, face north in the *Ding*-shaped *Gang* formation.\n\n**Method for Expelling the Three Corpses:**\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, gather five *sheng* of peach leaves, pound them thoroughly, and sit upon them. Let the qi enter the nine orifices of the lower body and the abdomen. From dawn to dusk, the corpse-worms will emerge, freeing one from suffering and distress.\n\n**The Complete Chapter’s Seal:**\nThis refers to the compilation of all registers. \"Complete\" means to govern; \"chapter\" is the name for recording numbers; \"complete\" signifies the fulfillment of affairs. It encompasses all officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers, sealed and dispatched. The essential meaning of the Dao, the sequence of cultivation, preserving life and securing the body—these are the names of the registers governed by the Complete Department.\n\n*Excerpt from the* **Spiritual Writings: An Elbow’s Compilation** *concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "Consuming this enables one to ascend and commune with the Starry River, discerning the omens of heaven and earth’s calamities and transformations, the signs of fortune and misfortune in wind and water, and the outcomes of success or failure—all revealed by the essence of the stars. Should one practice and ingest the talismans of the Six Jia, regardless of year, month, or day, this is the Way of stabilizing the body, governing the viscera, and attaining longevity.\n\nIf there is an afflicted area, follow the *Containing Shadow Diagram* to select the appropriate talisman and affix it. This is called \"externally subduing ghosts and spirits,\" and within three days, the ailment will be cured. Internally, one may also harmonize with the talisman, and all illnesses will naturally dissipate.\n\nIn stabilization, one must constantly visualize the Seven Stars worn upon the head and beneath the feet, whether sitting crosswise or reclining. The \"stabilizer\" refers to suspending them at the forehead. \"Wearing upon the head and beneath the feet\" means walking the Four Cardinal Steps. The *Crosswise Dipper* rests upon the chest. The *Seated Dipper* is as if wearing the Dipper’s ascent. The *Reclining Dipper* resembles a standing person. The *Moving Dipper* has a diagram that follows. Internally, one visualizes the stars, which is largely the same as the external practice.\n\n**Yu’s Steps:**\nWith the right breath held, first step with the left foot, ensuring three steps and nine traces, with no fixed length between strides—adjust according to the altar’s size. If the altar is large, perform the Seven Stars’ *Ding*-shaped steps, which consist of seven *Ding* steps; any deviation from the *Ding* form is incorrect. If the steps do not reach the corners, simply proceed as usual, circling the altar. Whether for grand or minor rites, there is no need to previously establish a boundary. Once the boundary is set, hold water in the left hand and a sword in the right. At the northwest corner of the seat, stir the water three times with the sword. Then recite the incantation again:\n\n*\"Essence of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, enter this water. All hundred kinds of malevolent ghosts, swiftly flee ten thousand leagues—those who do not shall be slain!\"*\n\n*Hasten, as the law commands!*\n\nThen step away from the seat and spray the water. Recite another incantation:\n\n*\"Generals who slay evil, envoys who capture ghosts, drive away and repel—let no ghostly beings or perverse spirits dare approach!\"*\n\n*Hasten, as the law commands!*\n\nAt night, face north in the *Ding*-shaped *Gang* formation.\n\n**Method for Expelling the Three Corpses:**\nOn the fifth day of the fifth month, gather five *sheng* of peach leaves, pound them thoroughly, and sit upon them. Let the qi enter the nine orifices of the lower body and the abdomen. From dawn to dusk, the corpse-worms will emerge, freeing one from suffering and distress.\n\n**The Complete Chapter’s Seal:**\nThis refers to the compilation of all registers. \"Complete\" means to govern; \"chapter\" is the name for recording numbers; \"complete\" signifies the fulfillment of affairs. It encompasses all officials, generals, clerks, and soldiers, sealed and dispatched. The essential meaning of the Dao, the sequence of cultivation, preserving life and securing the body—these are the names of the registers governed by the Complete Department.\n\n*Excerpt from the* **Spiritual Writings: An Elbow’s Compilation** *concludes.*",
