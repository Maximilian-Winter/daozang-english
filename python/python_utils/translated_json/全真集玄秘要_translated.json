  "full_translation": "*The Comprehensive Collection of the Mysteries of the Dao*\n*Title:* *The Comprehensive Collection of the Mysteries of the Dao*\n*Authored by:* Li Daochun of the Yuan Dynasty\n*Volume:* One\n*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category\n\n---\n\nTo comprehend the great foundation of fire and timing, one must study the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. The wondrous application of the Great Elixir models itself upon Qian and Kun.\n\n\"Great\" signifies the ultimate. \"Elixir\" signifies perfect roundness. As the Great Master Dian said: \"Once you recognize this ○, heaven and earth cannot compare to its vastness, sun and moon cannot compare to its roundness.\" The sagely teacher said: \"The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir; the four temporal conditions serve as the furnace to refine it into a sphere.\" Thus, the Great Elixir refers to the true nature. \"Modeling upon Qian and Kun\" means emulating heaven and earth.\n\nQian and Kun operate, and the Five Phases emerge. Qian and Kun are body and mind; the Five Phases are essence, spirit, hun-soul, po-soul, and intent. As Qian and Kun move, the Five Qi are complete within. When the Five Phases proceed in sequence, the ordinary Dao is characterized by arising and ceasing. As the ancestral master said: \"When the Five Phases proceed in order, the dharma-realm becomes a pit of fire.\" This refers to the Five Phases generating the myriad things—the Dao of the Five Constants. The Dao of the Five Constants belongs to the dharma of arising and ceasing.\n\nWhen the Five Phases reverse their course, the elixir-body remains eternally numinous and enduring. As the ancestral master said: \"When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields the seven treasures.\" This \"reversal\" means gathering the Five Phases—the Dao of true constancy. The Dao of true constancy endures without decay.\n\nFrom the formless, a sign emerges. Laozi said: \"The Dao gives birth to the One.\" \"Formless and spontaneous\" means the Dao arises from primordial emptiness as the One Qi—this is the human spirit transformed by emptiness. The Two Modes arise from the One as their root. Laozi said: \"The One gives birth to the Two.\" When the One Qi divides, the Two Modes are established—this is the human foundation of establishing nature and life.\n\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies. Master Shao said: \"The Two divide to become the Four.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Two Modes generate the Four Images.\" This refers to the human establishment of nature and life. The Eight Trigrams mutually serve as ancestors and descendants. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.\" \"Ancestors and descendants\" means Qian and Kun give birth to the six children, and the six children generate the sixty-four hexagrams. Qian and Kun are the ancestors; the various hexagrams are the descendants.\n\nThe adept returns to exhaust the myriad things within the self and attains it naturally. The myriad images arise from transformation and movement. When the Eight Trigrams transform and move, the sixty-four hexagrams are born—this is like the human mind, once stirred, giving rise to the ten thousand conditions and myriad thoughts. Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise in profusion. As Master Zhou said: \"Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise from movement.\" Alas! There is only one fortune—how can one not be cautious? Thus, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise from transformation and movement.\n\nThe common people do not recognize the Dao in their daily use. Though the common people employ the Dao daily, they remain unaware, for their emotions and perceptions obscure it. Thus, the Dao of the noble person is rare. The sage is able to investigate the root and source. The sage observes above and examines below, investigating the root and tracing the source, embodying heaven to establish the ultimate. Setting forth images and bequeathing words, the book of the *Changes* was thus composed.\n\nThe marvelous Dao of the *Changes* exhausts the substance and function of creation. The book of the *Changes* fully encompasses the substance and function of creation, penetrating the world’s transformations, determining the world’s affairs. It is supremely vast, utterly refined—thus it is called the *Zhou Changes*. Therefore, it entrusts its images to this text. The Dao of the *Changes* is vast and all-encompassing: through it, one may study Buddhism to become a buddha, study immortality to become an immortal, or cultivate self, family, state, and world to achieve self-cultivation, family harmony, state governance, and world peace. Thus, Wei Boyang entrusted its images to the alchemical *Cantong Qi*.\n\nWhen Pi and Tai interact, yin and yang ascend or descend. The hexagrams Pi and Tai are the critical juncture of yin-yang exchange. In the Tai hexagram, the three yang lines ascend—at this time, one must guard against peril. In the Pi hexagram, the three yin lines descend—at this time, one must hold firm.\n\nWhen Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk. Zhun and Meng mark the beginning of practice. In terms of the year, the six days after the winter solstice are Zhun, and the next six days are Meng. In terms of the month, the first day from Zi to Si is Zhun, and from Wu to Hai is Meng. In terms of the body, the initial stirring of *tian gui* is Zhun, and the spring emerging beneath the mountain is Meng.\n\nKan and Li represent the male and female, water and fire. Kan is the middle son; Li is the middle daughter. When Kan and Li unite, water and fire achieve mutual completion. As [Peng] Xiaozu said: \"Take the solid center of the Kan position, and transmute the yin within the belly of the Li palace.\"\n\nZhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, the hun and po souls. Zhen is the dragon and the hun-soul; Dui is the tiger and the po-soul. In sum, they are nature and emotions. As the ancestral master said: \"When metal returns to nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.\" This is the meaning.\n\nAbiding in the center brings supreme fortune in the Yellow Skirt. Abiding in the center means avoiding excess and deficiency. During the retreat of the tally, when reaching the sixth line of Kun, abiding in the center and proceeding below avoids the perils of excess and deficiency—thus it is called \"supreme fortune in the Yellow Skirt.\"\n\nEncountering Kang means being without position yet honored. Kang refers to the top line of Qian, \"the dragon soars too high and has cause for regret.\" When advancing the fire to the top line, one must recognize the need to preserve fullness. Without this recognition, all prior efforts are wasted.\n\nJi and Wei carefully attend to the beginning and end of the myriad things. Ji and Wei mark the completion of the fire-timing cycle. Cycling without end, it is thus said: \"carefully attend to the beginning and end of the myriad things.\" Fu and Gou illuminate the return and union of the Two Qi. Qian and Kun are the gates of the Eight Trigrams; Fu and Gou are the Two Qi of the sixty-four hexagrams. Their coming and going is endless and ceaseless—thus creation is accomplished.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit and essence. The moon’s waxing and waning exemplify the principles of withdrawal and addition, reduction and increase. The rising and setting of the sun accord with the cold and warmth of *rong* and *wei*. The sun’s rising and setting exemplify the methods of circulation, nourishment, and harmonization.\n\nThis text establishes its discourse to clarify the obscure.\n\nThose who establish discourse to clarify the obscure employ the cauldron of Qian and Kun, and require the medicine of the Crow and Hare. Having grasped the image, one may forget the words; the Dao of the Golden Elixir, though known by myriad names, is all metaphor. To know its essentials, one must chew the words and savor their flavor; having grasped the essentials, one may forget the words. It is like setting up an image to point to the meaning—once the image is grasped, one must still seek the meaning. When the words are realized, the image must be discarded. To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed. The enlightened find only simplicity and ease: Qian’s Way of generating things is easy, Kun’s Way of completing things is simple. The enlightened extend and practice this, and the principle of ease and simplicity is attained. The deluded grow ever more entangled and difficult. If one clings to images and rigidly sets up the furnace, or seeks a steed by following a picture, the more entangled and difficult it becomes, and one will achieve nothing in a lifetime. Thus, those who aspire to cultivate the true must read the *Cantong Qi* without clinging to images or adhering to the text.\n\nThe cultivated adept who reads the *Cantong Qi* should chew its words and seek the profound—certainly, they will attain it. What benefit is there in clinging to the text and images?\n\n**Diagram of the Supreme Polarity Explained**\n\"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity\" (○) refers to the natural state of emptiness and nothingness. It begins from the beginningless, is named from the nameless, and cannot be spoken of—yet, for want of a term, it is forcibly called ○. The sage has a way to show later generations, tracing the flow back to its source and not forgetting its root, thus establishing the image and bequeathing the words, naming it \"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity.\" This means it is the ultimate beyond all knowing, not something to be grasped by private conjecture. Nor does it mean that before the Supreme Polarity there is another Non-Polarity—the Supreme Polarity is itself Non-Polarity. The enlightened need only focus on the word \"to\" (*er*), and they will naturally perceive it. This is what the Buddhists call the luminous wondrous root before kalpas, and what Laozi refers to as \"prior to the Lord on High.\" As Dadian said: \"Do you recognize this ○? Heaven and earth cannot compare to its vastness, sun and moon cannot compare to its brightness. Gathered, it is smaller than the smallest; released, it is larger than the largest.\" Is this not the wonder of the Supreme Polarity?\n\nTurning inward to seek within oneself, \"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity\" is the spirit born of emptiness. The greatest of things all have limits, but the greatness of spirit flows boundlessly, transforming and completing heaven and earth—what could surpass it? Because its wondrous being is beyond measure, it is called *shen* (spirit). Is not spirit the true reality of Non-Polarity?\n\nThe Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it returns to stillness. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness give rise to one another, and thus the root is established. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes arise—this is the transformation of the Supreme Polarity. Before the Supreme Polarity was divided, the principle of movement and stillness already existed; when the Two Qi first separated, the mechanism of movement and stillness began to operate.\n\nThe Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang—this is the Supreme Polarity’s transformation and movement. Movement returns to stillness—this is yang transforming into yin. Stillness generates yin; stillness returns to movement—this is yin transforming into yang. \"Giving rise to one another\" means yin intermingles with yang, and yang intermingles with yin. In one movement and one stillness, yin and yang are divided, the clear ascends and the turbid descends, and the Two Qi are separated. The clear that ascends is called heaven; the turbid that descends is called earth. Heaven moves and earth is still; the Two Qi circulate, and the progression of transformation cannot be obstructed. Laozi said: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" This means that the opening and closing of the Mysterious Female give birth to heaven and earth—the Mysterious Female is the mechanism of yin and yang’s movement and stillness.\n\nTurning inward to seek within oneself, one knows that emptiness transforms into spirit. Where there is spirit, there is resonance; when spirit resonates, it generates qi—this is \"movement generating yang.\" Qi gathers and generates essence—this is \"movement reaching its limit and returning to stillness, stillness generating yin.\" Essence transforms and takes form—this is \"stillness reaching its limit and returning to movement.\" Stillness and qi generate one another; nature and life are established, and body and mind are divided. Qi moves through the mind—this is how the Way of Heaven operates. Essence governs the body—this is how the Way of Earth is established. Thus, body and mind are the Two Modes.\n\nYang transforms and yin unites, generating water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The Five Phases are arranged in order, and the four seasons proceed—this is the transformation of the Two Modes. \"Two\" refers to duality, but why is it called \"Two Modes\"? \"Two Modes\" refers to their pairing and union. When paired, there is resonance; when resonating, there is transformation and communication. Yang transforms and yin unites—yin and yang resonate and unite, generating the Five Phases.\n\nHeaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Five generates earth—these are the generating numbers of the Five Phases. The Five Phases circulate and transform, their mechanism unceasing; the four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born. Speaking of the body, body and mind are established, essence and qi flow, the five viscera are generated, and the five spirits are complete.\n\nHeaven One generates water—essence is stored in the kidneys. Earth Two generates fire—spirit is stored in the heart. Heaven Three generates wood—the *hun* is stored in the liver. Earth Four generates metal—the *po* is stored in the lungs. Heaven Five generates earth—the *yi* is stored in the spleen. The Five Phases move, and the Four Beginnings emerge. Those who grasp this principle can follow the changes of the times to accord with the Dao.\n\nThe Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity. Heaven One, Heaven Three, Heaven Five are yang numbers; Earth Two, Earth Four are yin numbers. Thus, it is said the Five Phases are one yin-yang. Yang is the Supreme Polarity’s movement; yin is the Supreme Polarity’s stillness. When movement and stillness are not two, one returns to the root—thus, yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity. Returning to the root is uniting with original emptiness—thus, the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity.\n\nThose who practice cultivation circulate qi and return it, cycling without end, for only spirit does not change. Because it does not change, its transformations are inexhaustible.\n\nGathering the Five Phases is spirit; uniting yin and yang is also spirit. Spirit is fundamentally empty. Refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, refining spirit to return to emptiness—this is called returning to the root and restoring the origin. Restoring the origin is reverting to Non-Polarity.\n\nThe generation of the Five Phases each possesses its own nature. That the Five Phases each possesses its own nature means each of the Five Phases contains a Supreme Polarity. The generating numbers of the Five Phases, when each is added to five, become the completing numbers. Heaven One generates water and adds five, so Earth Six completes water. Earth Two generates fire and adds five, so Heaven Seven completes fire. Heaven Three generates wood and adds five, so Earth Eight completes wood. Earth Four generates metal and adds five, so Heaven Nine completes metal. Heaven Five generates earth and adds five, so Earth Ten completes earth. This is called each of the Five Phases containing the Five Phases.\n\nThe earlier statement that the Five Phases are one yin-yang and yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity refers to their essence. Here, that the Five Phases each possesses its own nature refers to their function. Speaking of essence, the Five Phases share one Supreme Polarity. Speaking of function, each of the Five Phases possesses its own Supreme Polarity. Speaking of essence is returning to the root and restoring the origin. Speaking of function is the vastness of its application.\n\nEssence is the reverse sequence; function is the forward sequence. The reverse sequence knows its beginning; the forward sequence knows its end. Knowing the beginning but not the end, one cannot govern the vast; knowing the end but not the beginning, one cannot exhaust the subtle. Tracing back to the beginning, one merges with the undifferentiated, uniting with Non-Polarity. Projecting forward to the end, one sees ceaseless generation and transformation, operating without end. When reverse and forward sequences complement each other, beginning and end are not two; the manifest and the subtle are seamless, and the principles of nature interpenetrate. This is called essence and function combined to accord with the Dao.\n\nThe true of Non-Polarity and the essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal. The true of Non-Polarity is the marvelous responsiveness of original spirit. The essence of the Two and Five is the wondrous union of the Five Phases. Their wondrous union and congealment gives rise to the ten thousand beings.\n\nGreat indeed is the true of Non-Polarity! It is the ancestor of the prior heaven, the root of the Great Monad, the mother of the Three Origins, the honored one among all marvels. Unchanging above and below, it endures through ancient and modern times. Heaven attains it and firmly establishes its position; earth attains it and solidly takes form. Qian establishes position, and the ten thousand things rely on it for their beginning; Kun takes form, and the ten thousand things rely on it for their birth.\n\nProfound indeed is the essence of the Two and Five! Neither existent nor non-existent, neither turbid nor clear, dimly discernible yet obscure, subtly formless and beyond comparison—heaven and earth rely on it to establish their positions, the sun and moon rely on it to circulate, qi relies on it to transform and fuse, and the ten thousand things rely on it to be born and completed.\n\nPeople only know they receive life from heaven and earth, yet do not know they receive qi from the true of Non-Polarity. People only know they stand between heaven and earth, yet do not know they take form from the essence of the Two and Five. If the essence of Non-Polarity does not transform spirit, it is insufficient to transform the formless. If the essence of the Two and Five does not wondrously unite with qi, it is insufficient to transform form.\n\nTo refine spirit, one must first preserve the true. To secure form, one must first preserve essence. When true essence is not dissipated, qi is stabilized and spirit is numinous. When form and spirit are both wondrous, one unites with the Dao in truth. The sage’s great task is then complete.\n\nThe Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female. The two qi interact and give rise to the ten thousand things, which generate and transform without end.\n\n○ is the ultimate of humanity. In human birth, those who obtain the Dao of Qian become male; those who obtain the Dao of Kun become female. In terms of hexagrams, when Qian’s initial line interacts with Kun, it forms Zhen, which is the eldest son. When Kun’s initial line interacts with Qian, it forms Xun, which is the eldest daughter. When Qian’s middle line interacts with Kun, it forms Kan, which is the middle son. When Kun’s middle line interacts with Qian, it forms Li, which is the middle daughter. When Qian’s top line interacts with Kun, it forms Gen, which is the youngest son. When Kun’s top line interacts with Qian, it forms Dui, which is the youngest daughter. These six children are the mutual bodies of Qian and Kun. When the six children interact, the sixty-four hexagrams are complete. The sixty-four hexagrams transform endlessly, and the ten thousand things generate and transform without cease.\n\nIn terms of the body, Qian is the head and Kun is the abdomen—heaven and earth establish their positions. Li is the eyes and Kan is the ears—water and fire do not oppose each other. Zhen is the feet and Xun is the hands—thunder and wind press upon each other. Gen is the nose and Dui is the mouth—mountain and marsh communicate qi. These are the eight trigrams of the physical form.\n\nIf we speak of nature and disposition, Qian and Kun are body and mind; Kan and Li are spirit and essence; Zhen and Dui are hun and po; Gen and Xun are intention and qi. When the eight trigrams are arrayed, spirit moves within them. Being and non-being intermingle, inner and outer interact, and from this arise the ten thousand thoughts and myriad concerns—are these not the ten thousand things of a single body?\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Yijing* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the ten thousand things transform to purity; male and female unite their essences, and the ten thousand things transform to life.\" This is precisely what it means. Heaven and earth generate, complete, and transform without cease, and the ten thousand things generate and transform without end.\n\n○ is the Supreme Polarity of the ten thousand things. Only humans obtain its finest essence and are most numinous. Once form is born, spirit awakens to knowing, the five qi stir, good and evil divide, and the ten thousand affairs arise.\n\nHeaven is positioned above, earth below, and humans and things in between. Heaven and earth are the parents of the ten thousand things. Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most numinous, obtaining the mean of central harmony. Thus, spirit and the Dao merge indistinguishably, one and inseparable.\n\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them—just as when body and mind are established, spirit moves within them. Heaven and humans were never separate; why then does humanity consider itself small?\n\nThis stems from ignorance of its origin. Tracing back to the root, before a person’s birth, they are nurtured within the Great Beginning, pure and whole, never for a moment separated. Once born, qi transforms into form, form arises and qi gathers, spirit awakens to knowing. The original numinous awareness of the true—this is the true of the Non-Ultimate.\n\nThe five qi stir and move, the true mechanism responds subtly, manifesting externally. Essence responds to the ears and is called hearing—earth’s sixth completion forms water. Spirit responds to the mouth and is called speech—heaven’s seventh completion forms fire. The hun-soul responds to the eyes and is called sight—earth’s eighth completion forms wood. The po-soul responds to the nose and is called smell—heaven’s ninth completion forms metal. Intention responds to the body and is called movement—earth’s tenth completion forms soil. Once the true mechanism is activated, right and wrong divide, and the ten thousand affairs emerge therefrom.\n\nIf, however, one gathers body and mind, dispels emotions and perceptions, unites the five and gathers the three, embraces the origin and guards the One, withdraws sight and reverses hearing, seals qi and regulates breath, prevents external realms from entering and internal realms from departing, returns qi to emptiness, and conceals spirit in stillness—how then could there be any division of good and evil?\n\nAs for embracing the essence of the Two and Five, containing the fluid of Great Harmony, restoring the true of the Non-Ultimate, and entering the realm of Emptiness and Nothingness—this is called returning to the root and reverting to the origin, regaining the mandate and restoring life. Yu Chan said: *\"Before father and mother were born, there are endless living paths; after body and mind cease movement, the true mechanism of the Non-Ultimate reappears.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nThe sage establishes the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness. The sage probes the profound and attains the distant, moving always in accord with principle. Where principle resides, none in the world can contend with it. Thus, in cultivating virtue and undertaking affairs, one must first root oneself in exhausting principle. The essence of exhausting principle lies in taking the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness as the foundation. Therefore, the sage establishes them as the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness to set the ultimate standard and establish teachings.\n\nThe mean is non-bias. Humaneness and rightness are the expression of heaven’s nature. Pervading heaven and filling earth, revolving the pivot of the mechanism, still and unmoving, embodying things without deviation—this is the mean. Level and straightforward, yielding and magnanimous, tranquil and abiding in stillness, responding to things without limit—this is correctness. Restraining the self and returning to propriety, universally aiding and broadly bestowing, perfecting and accommodating, interacting with things without selfishness—this is humaneness. In action and repose, speech and silence, responding and following, benefiting self and others, harmonizing with things without contention—this is rightness.\n\nThe mean is the great root of the world. Correctness is the utmost appropriateness of the world. Humaneness is the great impartiality of the world. Rightness is the utmost harmony of the world. The *Wenyan* states: *\"Profit is the harmony of rightness.\"* It also says: *\"Benefiting things suffices to harmonize rightness.\"* Thus, humaneness and rightness are the essence of cultivating virtue and undertaking affairs. The mean and correctness are the essence of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature.\n\nThe mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness encompass heaven and earth, order the ten thousand kinds, and when applied to cultivating the self, the self is cultivated; when applied to governing the state, the state is well-governed. Circling the four seas, weaving through heaven and earth, from the vast to the minute, nothing is not fully provided. For the cultivating gentleman, if he truly reverses day and night, focuses his will without division, I see his attainment of the Dao as easy. Rooted in stillness, he establishes the ultimate standard for humanity.\n\nWhat is called stillness is not non-movement. If non-movement were stillness, then earth and stone could all become sages. The *Tongshu* says: *\"Movement has no stillness—this is stillness within movement, true stillness.\"* After the onset of winter, closure and completion form winter—this is called stillness. Can the ceaseless movement of the sun, moon, and stars be called non-movement? At the winter solstice, the gates are closed, showing the people stillness awaiting movement. Thus, within movement there is stillness, and within stillness there is movement—this is the mechanism of transformation.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and the heart of heaven becomes visible. The Master said: *\"Return—is this not the manifestation of heaven and earth’s heart?\"* Thus, nothing is more precious than stillness as the root of the ten thousand things. Stillness upon stillness—spirit attains its correctness, principle is thereby exhausted, nature is thereby fulfilled, extending to life, transcending the ordinary and surpassing the sage. Laozi said: *\"In clarity and stillness, the world is rightly ordered.\"* The *Great Learning* states: *\"Stability precedes stillness.\"* Stillness in human life is heaven’s nature.\n\nIf one takes stillness as the foundation and, in ordinary practice, gathers the moving mind, eliminates false emotions, calms the upright qi, and nourishes the original essence, naturally within the stillness of unmoving, one connects with the ten thousand things. Thus, in stillness, there is stillness; in movement, there is stillness. Moving and responding to things, the body remains constantly still—this is called true stillness. With true stillness prolonged, clarity and subtlety arise; with clarity and subtlety, transparency emerges; with transparency, numinous penetration follows. Transparent and numinously penetrating, the ten directions are unimpeded—this is called utmost clarity and stillness.\n\nWhen the heart is clear and still, the body is settled and still. When one body is clear and still, many bodies are clear and still; when many bodies are clear and still, mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all clear and still. When all is clear and still, the world will naturally be rightly ordered. The scripture says: *\"If a person can constantly be clear and still, heaven and earth will all return.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nThe ancient sages said: *\"Rooted in stillness, the ultimate standard for humanity is established.\"* This is the sage’s teaching of human effort. Who but those who observe return and know transformation could attain this? Thus, the sage harmonizes his virtue with heaven and earth, his brightness with the sun and moon, his order with the four seasons, and his auspices and ill-fortune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe sage’s relation to the world is like heaven’s relation to the ten thousand things. Thus, his virtue equals that of heaven and earth, his brightness equals that of the sun and moon, his order aligns with the four seasons, and his mechanism harmonizes with creation. The sage embodies the movement of yin and yang, comprehends the principles of things and affairs—this is prior to heaven. The gentleman models himself on the sage, follows and complies with the seasons—this is posterior to heaven.\n\nThat which is prior to heaven is the natural principle of heaven, which does not oppose me. That which is posterior to heaven is my refusal to oppose heaven. As the *Wenyan* states: \"Act prior to heaven, and heaven does not oppose; act posterior to heaven, and follow heaven’s seasons.\" If even heaven does not oppose, how much less should humans, how much less spirits and gods? The gentleman cultivates this and attains good fortune; the petty person defies it and meets misfortune. The gentleman follows and complies with the seasons, rectifies his heart and sincerely cultivates himself—thus he is ever auspicious. The petty person turns his back on principle and violates righteousness, indulges his passions and pursues delusion—thus he is ever inauspicious.\n\nThe essence of cultivation lies in compliance with the seasons; the essence of compliance with the seasons lies in stillness. In stillness, nothing is unconquerable; when nothing is unconquerable, its limit cannot be known. When its limit cannot be known, one may unite with the sage; uniting with the sage, one then knows the Dao of what is prior to heaven—at this point, return is achieved. Guangchengzi said: \"Do not strain your sight or hearing; embrace the spirit and be still. The spirit will then rectify itself. Stillness must be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain longevity.\" Thus, stillness is the foundation of entering sagehood. How sagely was Master Zhou! With a single phrase, he encapsulated it: \"Abide in stillness.\" Could he not be the teacher of all humans and heavens for ten thousand generations?\n\nThus it is said: The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness. The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang—this is heaven’s Qian and Kun. The Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness—this is earth’s Qian and Kun. The Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is humanity’s Qian and Kun. This is called the three powers taking form, each possessing its own heaven and earth, each possessing its own Supreme Ultimate, each undergoing transformation. Tracing their origin, they fundamentally share a single Supreme Ultimate. Returning to seek within oneself, the Dao of the three powers is complete in one’s own body.\n\nThe Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang—this is the spirit and qi of the heart. The Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness—this is the essence and po of the body. The Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is the emotions and nature of the mind. When body, heart, and mind are settled, the three flowers gather, and sagehood is accomplished.\n\nTracing things to their origin and returning to their end, one thus understands the discourse on life and death. Tracing their origin, all things emerge from a single Supreme Ultimate; returning to their end, all things revert to a single Supreme Ultimate. Returning to seek within oneself, primordial qi is the origin of one’s body. Originating from primordial qi, one is born prior to heaven and preserved posterior to heaven, circulating through the six voids, filling the eight directions, penetrating earth and connecting with heaven, passing through metal and piercing stone—the three powers are established thereby. The sage embodies this to return to the root and restore life, reverting to the initial state of nature. In the midst of the indistinct and vague, a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions naturally achieve perfection.\n\nAll that has form receives this and lives; loses this and perishes. When gathered, it is concealed within the tip of a hair; when released, it fills beyond the vastness of the cosmos, encompassing the ten thousand existents, so great it is difficult to measure. Tracing its origin, it precedes heaven and earth, blending into perfection—this is the primordial essence of the body. From its beginning as a thing, it is forcibly named \"primordial qi.\" Thus, this body exists because of qi and takes form; form changes and gives rise to life; life changes and gives rise to death. Life is the gathering of qi, the emergence of the ten thousand things from the mechanism. Death is the dispersal of qi, the return of the ten thousand things to the mechanism. Emergence and return, gathering and dispersal—this is the mechanism of the Supreme Ultimate’s movement and stillness. Movement must end in stillness; emergence must end in return; life must end in death. Thus, tracing things to their origin and returning to their end, one understands the discourse on life and death.\n\nOnly the spirit is unfathomable in its beginning, unknowable in its end. It endures through thousands and tens of thousands of generations without change or alteration, without past or present, without birth or extinction. Because it does not change, it can ceaselessly transform and generate. The spirit is that which is sagely yet unknowable. Those who comprehend this principle cultivate the spirit through quiet sitting, nurture qi through peaceful sleep, immerse their emotions in tranquility, and concentrate their minds on the ultimate—thus attaining the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.\n\nHow great is the *Yi*! This is its ultimate. The *Yi* in the world is never without change, never without transformation. Generation upon generation, transformation upon transformation—endless is the wonder of the *Yi*. The spirit has no fixed direction; the *Yi* has no fixed form. That which penetrates the world’s changes is the *Yi*; that which exhausts the world’s changes is the spirit. As the *Xi Ci* of the *Yi* states: \"The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings.\" The Supreme Ultimate is the beginning of transformation. The Two Modes are the transformation of the Supreme Ultimate. The Four Images are the transformation of the Two Modes. The Eight Trigrams are the transformation of the Four Images. Good and ill fortune are the transformation of the Eight Trigrams. The sixty-four hexagrams, the ten thousand affairs and principles, all sentient beings—all are transformations of the Eight Trigrams. That which ultimately does not change is the *Yi*. Because it does not change, its transformations are inexhaustible.\n\nTracing their origin, one qi generates the ten thousand existents; returning to their end, the ten thousand existents revert to one nothingness. That which does not change from beginning to end is the spirit. Because it does not change, it can ceaselessly transform. Dispersing one nothingness into the ten thousand existents is the spirit; gathering the ten thousand existents back into one nothingness is also the spirit. Spirit and *Yi*—how ultimate, how great!\n\n*The Secret Essentials of the Collected Perfection of the Dao* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "*The Comprehensive Collection of the Mysteries of the Dao*\n*Title:* *The Comprehensive Collection of the Mysteries of the Dao*\n*Authored by:* Li Daochun of the Yuan Dynasty\n*Volume:* One\n*Source Text:* *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongzhen* Section, Methods Category\n\n---\n\nTo comprehend the great foundation of fire and timing, one must study the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*. The wondrous application of the Great Elixir models itself upon Qian and Kun.\n\n\"Great\" signifies the ultimate. \"Elixir\" signifies perfect roundness. As the Great Master Dian said: \"Once you recognize this ○, heaven and earth cannot compare to its vastness, sun and moon cannot compare to its roundness.\" The sagely teacher said: \"The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir; the four temporal conditions serve as the furnace to refine it into a sphere.\" Thus, the Great Elixir refers to the true nature. \"Modeling upon Qian and Kun\" means emulating heaven and earth.\n\nQian and Kun operate, and the Five Phases emerge. Qian and Kun are body and mind; the Five Phases are essence, spirit, hun-soul, po-soul, and intent. As Qian and Kun move, the Five Qi are complete within. When the Five Phases proceed in sequence, the ordinary Dao is characterized by arising and ceasing. As the ancestral master said: \"When the Five Phases proceed in order, the dharma-realm becomes a pit of fire.\" This refers to the Five Phases generating the myriad things—the Dao of the Five Constants. The Dao of the Five Constants belongs to the dharma of arising and ceasing.\n\nWhen the Five Phases reverse their course, the elixir-body remains eternally numinous and enduring. As the ancestral master said: \"When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields the seven treasures.\" This \"reversal\" means gathering the Five Phases—the Dao of true constancy. The Dao of true constancy endures without decay.\n\nFrom the formless, a sign emerges. Laozi said: \"The Dao gives birth to the One.\" \"Formless and spontaneous\" means the Dao arises from primordial emptiness as the One Qi—this is the human spirit transformed by emptiness. The Two Modes arise from the One as their root. Laozi said: \"The One gives birth to the Two.\" When the One Qi divides, the Two Modes are established—this is the human foundation of establishing nature and life.\n\nThe Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies. Master Shao said: \"The Two divide to become the Four.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Two Modes generate the Four Images.\" This refers to the human establishment of nature and life. The Eight Trigrams mutually serve as ancestors and descendants. The *Book of Changes* states: \"The Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.\" \"Ancestors and descendants\" means Qian and Kun give birth to the six children, and the six children generate the sixty-four hexagrams. Qian and Kun are the ancestors; the various hexagrams are the descendants.\n\nThe adept returns to exhaust the myriad things within the self and attains it naturally. The myriad images arise from transformation and movement. When the Eight Trigrams transform and move, the sixty-four hexagrams are born—this is like the human mind, once stirred, giving rise to the ten thousand conditions and myriad thoughts. Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise in profusion. As Master Zhou said: \"Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise from movement.\" Alas! There is only one fortune—how can one not be cautious? Thus, fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse, arise from transformation and movement.\n\nThe common people do not recognize the Dao in their daily use. Though the common people employ the Dao daily, they remain unaware, for their emotions and perceptions obscure it. Thus, the Dao of the noble person is rare. The sage is able to investigate the root and source. The sage observes above and examines below, investigating the root and tracing the source, embodying heaven to establish the ultimate. Setting forth images and bequeathing words, the book of the *Changes* was thus composed.\n\nThe marvelous Dao of the *Changes* exhausts the substance and function of creation. The book of the *Changes* fully encompasses the substance and function of creation, penetrating the world’s transformations, determining the world’s affairs. It is supremely vast, utterly refined—thus it is called the *Zhou Changes*. Therefore, it entrusts its images to this text. The Dao of the *Changes* is vast and all-encompassing: through it, one may study Buddhism to become a buddha, study immortality to become an immortal, or cultivate self, family, state, and world to achieve self-cultivation, family harmony, state governance, and world peace. Thus, Wei Boyang entrusted its images to the alchemical *Cantong Qi*.\n\nWhen Pi and Tai interact, yin and yang ascend or descend. The hexagrams Pi and Tai are the critical juncture of yin-yang exchange. In the Tai hexagram, the three yang lines ascend—at this time, one must guard against peril. In the Pi hexagram, the three yin lines descend—at this time, one must hold firm.\n\nWhen Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness occur at dawn and dusk. Zhun and Meng mark the beginning of practice. In terms of the year, the six days after the winter solstice are Zhun, and the next six days are Meng. In terms of the month, the first day from Zi to Si is Zhun, and from Wu to Hai is Meng. In terms of the body, the initial stirring of *tian gui* is Zhun, and the spring emerging beneath the mountain is Meng.\n\nKan and Li represent the male and female, water and fire. Kan is the middle son; Li is the middle daughter. When Kan and Li unite, water and fire achieve mutual completion. As [Peng] Xiaozu said: \"Take the solid center of the Kan position, and transmute the yin within the belly of the Li palace.\"\n\nZhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, the hun and po souls. Zhen is the dragon and the hun-soul; Dui is the tiger and the po-soul. In sum, they are nature and emotions. As the ancestral master said: \"When metal returns to nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.\" This is the meaning.\n\nAbiding in the center brings supreme fortune in the Yellow Skirt. Abiding in the center means avoiding excess and deficiency. During the retreat of the tally, when reaching the sixth line of Kun, abiding in the center and proceeding below avoids the perils of excess and deficiency—thus it is called \"supreme fortune in the Yellow Skirt.\"\n\nEncountering Kang means being without position yet honored. Kang refers to the top line of Qian, \"the dragon soars too high and has cause for regret.\" When advancing the fire to the top line, one must recognize the need to preserve fullness. Without this recognition, all prior efforts are wasted.\n\nJi and Wei carefully attend to the beginning and end of the myriad things. Ji and Wei mark the completion of the fire-timing cycle. Cycling without end, it is thus said: \"carefully attend to the beginning and end of the myriad things.\" Fu and Gou illuminate the return and union of the Two Qi. Qian and Kun are the gates of the Eight Trigrams; Fu and Gou are the Two Qi of the sixty-four hexagrams. Their coming and going is endless and ceaseless—thus creation is accomplished.\n\nThe waxing and waning of the moon correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit and essence. The moon’s waxing and waning exemplify the principles of withdrawal and addition, reduction and increase. The rising and setting of the sun accord with the cold and warmth of *rong* and *wei*. The sun’s rising and setting exemplify the methods of circulation, nourishment, and harmonization.\n\nThis text establishes its discourse to clarify the obscure.",

      "translated_text": "Those who establish discourse to clarify the obscure employ the cauldron of Qian and Kun, and require the medicine of the Crow and Hare. Having grasped the image, one may forget the words; the Dao of the Golden Elixir, though known by myriad names, is all metaphor. To know its essentials, one must chew the words and savor their flavor; having grasped the essentials, one may forget the words. It is like setting up an image to point to the meaning—once the image is grasped, one must still seek the meaning. When the words are realized, the image must be discarded. To cross the river, one needs a raft; upon reaching the shore, the boat is no longer needed. The enlightened find only simplicity and ease: Qian’s Way of generating things is easy, Kun’s Way of completing things is simple. The enlightened extend and practice this, and the principle of ease and simplicity is attained. The deluded grow ever more entangled and difficult. If one clings to images and rigidly sets up the furnace, or seeks a steed by following a picture, the more entangled and difficult it becomes, and one will achieve nothing in a lifetime. Thus, those who aspire to cultivate the true must read the *Cantong Qi* without clinging to images or adhering to the text.\n\nThe cultivated adept who reads the *Cantong Qi* should chew its words and seek the profound—certainly, they will attain it. What benefit is there in clinging to the text and images?\n\n**Diagram of the Supreme Polarity Explained**\n\"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity\" (○) refers to the natural state of emptiness and nothingness. It begins from the beginningless, is named from the nameless, and cannot be spoken of—yet, for want of a term, it is forcibly called ○. The sage has a way to show later generations, tracing the flow back to its source and not forgetting its root, thus establishing the image and bequeathing the words, naming it \"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity.\" This means it is the ultimate beyond all knowing, not something to be grasped by private conjecture. Nor does it mean that before the Supreme Polarity there is another Non-Polarity—the Supreme Polarity is itself Non-Polarity. The enlightened need only focus on the word \"to\" (*er*), and they will naturally perceive it. This is what the Buddhists call the luminous wondrous root before kalpas, and what Laozi refers to as \"prior to the Lord on High.\" As Dadian said: \"Do you recognize this ○? Heaven and earth cannot compare to its vastness, sun and moon cannot compare to its brightness. Gathered, it is smaller than the smallest; released, it is larger than the largest.\" Is this not the wonder of the Supreme Polarity?\n\nTurning inward to seek within oneself, \"From Non-Polarity to Supreme Polarity\" is the spirit born of emptiness. The greatest of things all have limits, but the greatness of spirit flows boundlessly, transforming and completing heaven and earth—what could surpass it? Because its wondrous being is beyond measure, it is called *shen* (spirit). Is not spirit the true reality of Non-Polarity?\n\nThe Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang; when movement reaches its limit, it returns to stillness. Stillness generates yin; when stillness reaches its limit, it returns to movement. Movement and stillness give rise to one another, and thus the root is established. Yin and yang are divided, and the Two Modes arise—this is the transformation of the Supreme Polarity. Before the Supreme Polarity was divided, the principle of movement and stillness already existed; when the Two Qi first separated, the mechanism of movement and stillness began to operate.\n\nThe Supreme Polarity moves and generates yang—this is the Supreme Polarity’s transformation and movement. Movement returns to stillness—this is yang transforming into yin. Stillness generates yin; stillness returns to movement—this is yin transforming into yang. \"Giving rise to one another\" means yin intermingles with yang, and yang intermingles with yin. In one movement and one stillness, yin and yang are divided, the clear ascends and the turbid descends, and the Two Qi are separated. The clear that ascends is called heaven; the turbid that descends is called earth. Heaven moves and earth is still; the Two Qi circulate, and the progression of transformation cannot be obstructed. Laozi said: \"The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\" This means that the opening and closing of the Mysterious Female give birth to heaven and earth—the Mysterious Female is the mechanism of yin and yang’s movement and stillness.\n\nTurning inward to seek within oneself, one knows that emptiness transforms into spirit. Where there is spirit, there is resonance; when spirit resonates, it generates qi—this is \"movement generating yang.\" Qi gathers and generates essence—this is \"movement reaching its limit and returning to stillness, stillness generating yin.\" Essence transforms and takes form—this is \"stillness reaching its limit and returning to movement.\" Stillness and qi generate one another; nature and life are established, and body and mind are divided. Qi moves through the mind—this is how the Way of Heaven operates. Essence governs the body—this is how the Way of Earth is established. Thus, body and mind are the Two Modes.\n\nYang transforms and yin unites, generating water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The Five Phases are arranged in order, and the four seasons proceed—this is the transformation of the Two Modes. \"Two\" refers to duality, but why is it called \"Two Modes\"? \"Two Modes\" refers to their pairing and union. When paired, there is resonance; when resonating, there is transformation and communication. Yang transforms and yin unites—yin and yang resonate and unite, generating the Five Phases.\n\nHeaven One generates water, Earth Two generates fire, Heaven Three generates wood, Earth Four generates metal, Heaven Five generates earth—these are the generating numbers of the Five Phases. The Five Phases circulate and transform, their mechanism unceasing; the four seasons proceed, and the hundred things are born. Speaking of the body, body and mind are established, essence and qi flow, the five viscera are generated, and the five spirits are complete.\n\nHeaven One generates water—essence is stored in the kidneys. Earth Two generates fire—spirit is stored in the heart. Heaven Three generates wood—the *hun* is stored in the liver. Earth Four generates metal—the *po* is stored in the lungs. Heaven Five generates earth—the *yi* is stored in the spleen. The Five Phases move, and the Four Beginnings emerge. Those who grasp this principle can follow the changes of the times to accord with the Dao.\n\nThe Five Phases are one yin-yang; yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity. Heaven One, Heaven Three, Heaven Five are yang numbers; Earth Two, Earth Four are yin numbers. Thus, it is said the Five Phases are one yin-yang. Yang is the Supreme Polarity’s movement; yin is the Supreme Polarity’s stillness. When movement and stillness are not two, one returns to the root—thus, yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity. Returning to the root is uniting with original emptiness—thus, the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity.\n\nThose who practice cultivation circulate qi and return it, cycling without end, for only spirit does not change. Because it does not change, its transformations are inexhaustible.",

The generating numbers of the Five Phases, when each is added to five, become the completing numbers. Heaven One generates water and adds five, so Earth Six completes water. Earth Two generates fire and adds five, so Heaven Seven completes fire. Heaven Three generates wood and adds five, so Earth Eight completes wood. Earth Four generates metal and adds five, so Heaven Nine completes metal. Heaven Five generates earth and adds five, so Earth Ten completes earth. This is called each of the Five Phases containing the Five Phases.\n\nThe earlier statement that the Five Phases are one yin-yang and yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity refers to their essence. Here, that the Five Phases each possesses its own nature refers to their function. Speaking of essence, the Five Phases share one Supreme Polarity. Speaking of function, each of the Five Phases possesses its own Supreme Polarity. Speaking of essence is returning to the root and restoring the origin. Speaking of function is the vastness of its application.\n\nEssence is the reverse sequence; function is the forward sequence. The reverse sequence knows its beginning; the forward sequence knows its end. Knowing the beginning but not the end, one cannot govern the vast; knowing the end but not the beginning, one cannot exhaust the subtle. Tracing back to the beginning, one merges with the undifferentiated, uniting with Non-Polarity. Projecting forward to the end, one sees ceaseless generation and transformation, operating without end. When reverse and forward sequences complement each other, beginning and end are not two; the manifest and the subtle are seamless, and the principles of nature interpenetrate. This is called essence and function combined to accord with the Dao.\n\nThe true of Non-Polarity and the essence of the Two and Five wondrously unite and congeal. The true of Non-Polarity is the marvelous responsiveness of original spirit. The essence of the Two and Five is the wondrous union of the Five Phases. Their wondrous union and congealment gives rise to the ten thousand beings.\n\nGreat indeed is the true of Non-Polarity! It is the ancestor of the prior heaven, the root of the Great Monad, the mother of the Three Origins, the honored one among all marvels. Unchanging above and below, it endures through ancient and modern times. Heaven attains it and firmly establishes its position; earth attains it and solidly takes form. Qian establishes position, and the ten thousand things rely on it for their beginning; Kun takes form, and the ten thousand things rely on it for their birth.\n\nProfound indeed is the essence of the Two and Five! Neither existent nor non-existent, neither turbid nor clear, dimly discernible yet obscure, subtly formless and beyond comparison—heaven and earth rely on it to establish their positions, the sun and moon rely on it to circulate, qi relies on it to transform and fuse, and the ten thousand things rely on it to be born and completed.\n\nPeople only know they receive life from heaven and earth, yet do not know they receive qi from the true of Non-Polarity. People only know they stand between heaven and earth, yet do not know they take form from the essence of the Two and Five. If the essence of Non-Polarity does not transform spirit, it is insufficient to transform the formless. If the essence of the Two and Five does not wondrously unite with qi, it is insufficient to transform form.\n\nTo refine spirit, one must first preserve the true. To secure form, one must first preserve essence. When true essence is not dissipated, qi is stabilized and spirit is numinous. When form and spirit are both wondrous, one unites with the Dao in truth. The sage’s great task is then complete.\n\nThe Dao of Qian forms the male; the Dao of Kun forms the female. The two qi interact and give rise to the ten thousand things, which generate and transform without end.\n\n○ is the ultimate of humanity. In human birth, those who obtain the Dao of Qian become male; those who obtain the Dao of Kun become female. In terms of hexagrams, when Qian’s initial line interacts with Kun, it forms Zhen, which is the eldest son. When Kun’s initial line interacts with Qian, it forms Xun, which is the eldest daughter. When Qian’s middle line interacts with Kun, it forms Kan, which is the middle son. When Kun’s middle line interacts with Qian, it forms Li, which is the middle daughter. When Qian’s top line interacts with Kun, it forms Gen, which is the youngest son. When Kun’s top line interacts with Qian, it forms Dui, which is the youngest daughter. These six children are the mutual bodies of Qian and Kun. When the six children interact, the sixty-four hexagrams are complete. The sixty-four hexagrams transform endlessly, and the ten thousand things generate and transform without cease.\n\nIn terms of the body, Qian is the head and Kun is the abdomen—heaven and earth establish their positions. Li is the eyes and Kan is the ears—water and fire do not oppose each other. Zhen is the feet and Xun is the hands—thunder and wind press upon each other. Gen is the nose and Dui is the mouth—mountain and marsh communicate qi. These are the eight trigrams of the physical form.\n\nIf we speak of nature and disposition, Qian and Kun are body and mind; Kan and Li are spirit and essence; Zhen and Dui are hun and po; Gen and Xun are intention and qi. When the eight trigrams are arrayed, spirit moves within them. Being and non-being intermingle, inner and outer interact, and from this arise the ten thousand thoughts and myriad concerns—are these not the ten thousand things of a single body?\n\nThe *Appended Judgments* of the *Yijing* states: \"Heaven and earth intermingle, and the ten thousand things transform to purity; male and female unite their essences, and the ten thousand things transform to life.\" This is precisely what it means. Heaven and earth generate, complete, and transform without cease, and the ten thousand things generate and transform without end.\n\n○ is the Supreme Polarity of the ten thousand things. Only humans obtain its finest essence and are most numinous. Once form is born, spirit awakens to knowing, the five qi stir, good and evil divide, and the ten thousand affairs arise.\n\nHeaven is positioned above, earth below, and humans and things in between. Heaven and earth are the parents of the ten thousand things. Among the ten thousand things, humans are the most numinous, obtaining the mean of central harmony. Thus, spirit and the Dao merge indistinguishably, one and inseparable.\n\nHeaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them—just as when body and mind are established, spirit moves within them. Heaven and humans were never separate; why then does humanity consider itself small?",

When movement and stillness are not two, one returns to the root—thus, yin-yang is one Supreme Polarity. Returning to the root is uniting with original emptiness—thus, the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-Polarity.\n\nThose who practice cultivation circulate qi and return it, cycling without end, for only spirit does not change. Because it does not change, its transformations are inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "This stems from ignorance of its origin. Tracing back to the root, before a person’s birth, they are nurtured within the Great Beginning, pure and whole, never for a moment separated. Once born, qi transforms into form, form arises and qi gathers, spirit awakens to knowing. The original numinous awareness of the true—this is the true of the Non-Ultimate.\n\nThe five qi stir and move, the true mechanism responds subtly, manifesting externally. Essence responds to the ears and is called hearing—earth’s sixth completion forms water. Spirit responds to the mouth and is called speech—heaven’s seventh completion forms fire. The hun-soul responds to the eyes and is called sight—earth’s eighth completion forms wood. The po-soul responds to the nose and is called smell—heaven’s ninth completion forms metal. Intention responds to the body and is called movement—earth’s tenth completion forms soil. Once the true mechanism is activated, right and wrong divide, and the ten thousand affairs emerge therefrom.\n\nIf, however, one gathers body and mind, dispels emotions and perceptions, unites the five and gathers the three, embraces the origin and guards the One, withdraws sight and reverses hearing, seals qi and regulates breath, prevents external realms from entering and internal realms from departing, returns qi to emptiness, and conceals spirit in stillness—how then could there be any division of good and evil?\n\nAs for embracing the essence of the Two and Five, containing the fluid of Great Harmony, restoring the true of the Non-Ultimate, and entering the realm of Emptiness and Nothingness—this is called returning to the root and reverting to the origin, regaining the mandate and restoring life. Yu Chan said: *\"Before father and mother were born, there are endless living paths; after body and mind cease movement, the true mechanism of the Non-Ultimate reappears.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nThe sage establishes the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness. The sage probes the profound and attains the distant, moving always in accord with principle. Where principle resides, none in the world can contend with it. Thus, in cultivating virtue and undertaking affairs, one must first root oneself in exhausting principle. The essence of exhausting principle lies in taking the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness as the foundation. Therefore, the sage establishes them as the mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness to set the ultimate standard and establish teachings.\n\nThe mean is non-bias. Humaneness and rightness are the expression of heaven’s nature. Pervading heaven and filling earth, revolving the pivot of the mechanism, still and unmoving, embodying things without deviation—this is the mean. Level and straightforward, yielding and magnanimous, tranquil and abiding in stillness, responding to things without limit—this is correctness. Restraining the self and returning to propriety, universally aiding and broadly bestowing, perfecting and accommodating, interacting with things without selfishness—this is humaneness. In action and repose, speech and silence, responding and following, benefiting self and others, harmonizing with things without contention—this is rightness.\n\nThe mean is the great root of the world. Correctness is the utmost appropriateness of the world. Humaneness is the great impartiality of the world. Rightness is the utmost harmony of the world. The *Wenyan* states: *\"Profit is the harmony of rightness.\"* It also says: *\"Benefiting things suffices to harmonize rightness.\"* Thus, humaneness and rightness are the essence of cultivating virtue and undertaking affairs. The mean and correctness are the essence of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature.\n\nThe mean, correctness, humaneness, and rightness encompass heaven and earth, order the ten thousand kinds, and when applied to cultivating the self, the self is cultivated; when applied to governing the state, the state is well-governed. Circling the four seas, weaving through heaven and earth, from the vast to the minute, nothing is not fully provided. For the cultivating gentleman, if he truly reverses day and night, focuses his will without division, I see his attainment of the Dao as easy. Rooted in stillness, he establishes the ultimate standard for humanity.\n\nWhat is called stillness is not non-movement. If non-movement were stillness, then earth and stone could all become sages. The *Tongshu* says: *\"Movement has no stillness—this is stillness within movement, true stillness.\"* After the onset of winter, closure and completion form winter—this is called stillness. Can the ceaseless movement of the sun, moon, and stars be called non-movement? At the winter solstice, the gates are closed, showing the people stillness awaiting movement. Thus, within movement there is stillness, and within stillness there is movement—this is the mechanism of transformation.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme, movement arises, and the heart of heaven becomes visible. The Master said: *\"Return—is this not the manifestation of heaven and earth’s heart?\"* Thus, nothing is more precious than stillness as the root of the ten thousand things. Stillness upon stillness—spirit attains its correctness, principle is thereby exhausted, nature is thereby fulfilled, extending to life, transcending the ordinary and surpassing the sage. Laozi said: *\"In clarity and stillness, the world is rightly ordered.\"* The *Great Learning* states: *\"Stability precedes stillness.\"* Stillness in human life is heaven’s nature.\n\nIf one takes stillness as the foundation and, in ordinary practice, gathers the moving mind, eliminates false emotions, calms the upright qi, and nourishes the original essence, naturally within the stillness of unmoving, one connects with the ten thousand things. Thus, in stillness, there is stillness; in movement, there is stillness. Moving and responding to things, the body remains constantly still—this is called true stillness. With true stillness prolonged, clarity and subtlety arise; with clarity and subtlety, transparency emerges; with transparency, numinous penetration follows. Transparent and numinously penetrating, the ten directions are unimpeded—this is called utmost clarity and stillness.\n\nWhen the heart is clear and still, the body is settled and still. When one body is clear and still, many bodies are clear and still; when many bodies are clear and still, mountains, rivers, and the great earth are all clear and still. When all is clear and still, the world will naturally be rightly ordered. The scripture says: *\"If a person can constantly be clear and still, heaven and earth will all return.\"* This is what is meant.\n\nThe ancient sages said: *\"Rooted in stillness, the ultimate standard for humanity is established.\"* This is the sage’s teaching of human effort. Who but those who observe return and know transformation could attain this? Thus, the sage harmonizes his virtue with heaven and earth, his brightness with the sun and moon, his order with the four seasons, and his auspices and ill-fortune with ghosts and spirits.\n\nThe sage’s relation to the world is like heaven’s relation to the ten thousand things. Thus, his virtue equals that of heaven and earth, his brightness equals that of the sun and moon, his order aligns with the four seasons, and his mechanism harmonizes with creation. The sage embodies the movement of yin and yang, comprehends the principles of things and affairs—this is prior to heaven. The gentleman models himself on the sage, follows and complies with the seasons—this is posterior to heaven.",

      "translated_text": "That which is prior to heaven is the natural principle of heaven, which does not oppose me. That which is posterior to heaven is my refusal to oppose heaven. As the *Wenyan* states: \"Act prior to heaven, and heaven does not oppose; act posterior to heaven, and follow heaven’s seasons.\" If even heaven does not oppose, how much less should humans, how much less spirits and gods? The gentleman cultivates this and attains good fortune; the petty person defies it and meets misfortune. The gentleman follows and complies with the seasons, rectifies his heart and sincerely cultivates himself—thus he is ever auspicious. The petty person turns his back on principle and violates righteousness, indulges his passions and pursues delusion—thus he is ever inauspicious.\n\nThe essence of cultivation lies in compliance with the seasons; the essence of compliance with the seasons lies in stillness. In stillness, nothing is unconquerable; when nothing is unconquerable, its limit cannot be known. When its limit cannot be known, one may unite with the sage; uniting with the sage, one then knows the Dao of what is prior to heaven—at this point, return is achieved. Guangchengzi said: \"Do not strain your sight or hearing; embrace the spirit and be still. The spirit will then rectify itself. Stillness must be pure; do not weary your form, do not agitate your essence. Your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain longevity.\" Thus, stillness is the foundation of entering sagehood. How sagely was Master Zhou! With a single phrase, he encapsulated it: \"Abide in stillness.\" Could he not be the teacher of all humans and heavens for ten thousand generations?\n\nThus it is said: The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang; the Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness; the Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness. The Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang—this is heaven’s Qian and Kun. The Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness—this is earth’s Qian and Kun. The Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is humanity’s Qian and Kun. This is called the three powers taking form, each possessing its own heaven and earth, each possessing its own Supreme Ultimate, each undergoing transformation. Tracing their origin, they fundamentally share a single Supreme Ultimate. Returning to seek within oneself, the Dao of the three powers is complete in one’s own body.\n\nThe Dao of heaven is established as yin and yang—this is the spirit and qi of the heart. The Dao of earth is established as softness and hardness—this is the essence and po of the body. The Dao of humanity is established as benevolence and righteousness—this is the emotions and nature of the mind. When body, heart, and mind are settled, the three flowers gather, and sagehood is accomplished.\n\nTracing things to their origin and returning to their end, one thus understands the discourse on life and death. Tracing their origin, all things emerge from a single Supreme Ultimate; returning to their end, all things revert to a single Supreme Ultimate. Returning to seek within oneself, primordial qi is the origin of one’s body. Originating from primordial qi, one is born prior to heaven and preserved posterior to heaven, circulating through the six voids, filling the eight directions, penetrating earth and connecting with heaven, passing through metal and piercing stone—the three powers are established thereby. The sage embodies this to return to the root and restore life, reverting to the initial state of nature. In the midst of the indistinct and vague, a thousand harmonies and ten thousand unions naturally achieve perfection.\n\nAll that has form receives this and lives; loses this and perishes. When gathered, it is concealed within the tip of a hair; when released, it fills beyond the vastness of the cosmos, encompassing the ten thousand existents, so great it is difficult to measure. Tracing its origin, it precedes heaven and earth, blending into perfection—this is the primordial essence of the body. From its beginning as a thing, it is forcibly named \"primordial qi.\" Thus, this body exists because of qi and takes form; form changes and gives rise to life; life changes and gives rise to death. Life is the gathering of qi, the emergence of the ten thousand things from the mechanism. Death is the dispersal of qi, the return of the ten thousand things to the mechanism. Emergence and return, gathering and dispersal—this is the mechanism of the Supreme Ultimate’s movement and stillness. Movement must end in stillness; emergence must end in return; life must end in death. Thus, tracing things to their origin and returning to their end, one understands the discourse on life and death.\n\nOnly the spirit is unfathomable in its beginning, unknowable in its end. It endures through thousands and tens of thousands of generations without change or alteration, without past or present, without birth or extinction. Because it does not change, it can ceaselessly transform and generate. The spirit is that which is sagely yet unknowable. Those who comprehend this principle cultivate the spirit through quiet sitting, nurture qi through peaceful sleep, immerse their emotions in tranquility, and concentrate their minds on the ultimate—thus attaining the Dao of longevity and enduring vision.\n\nHow great is the *Yi*! This is its ultimate. The *Yi* in the world is never without change, never without transformation. Generation upon generation, transformation upon transformation—endless is the wonder of the *Yi*. The spirit has no fixed direction; the *Yi* has no fixed form. That which penetrates the world’s changes is the *Yi*; that which exhausts the world’s changes is the spirit. As the *Xi Ci* of the *Yi* states: \"The *Yi* possesses the Supreme Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams determine good and ill fortune; good and ill fortune give rise to great undertakings.\" The Supreme Ultimate is the beginning of transformation. The Two Modes are the transformation of the Supreme Ultimate. The Four Images are the transformation of the Two Modes. The Eight Trigrams are the transformation of the Four Images. Good and ill fortune are the transformation of the Eight Trigrams. The sixty-four hexagrams, the ten thousand affairs and principles, all sentient beings—all are transformations of the Eight Trigrams. That which ultimately does not change is the *Yi*. Because it does not change, its transformations are inexhaustible.\n\nTracing their origin, one qi generates the ten thousand existents; returning to their end, the ten thousand existents revert to one nothingness. That which does not change from beginning to end is the spirit. Because it does not change, it can ceaselessly transform. Dispersing one nothingness into the ten thousand existents is the spirit; gathering the ten thousand existents back into one nothingness is also the spirit. Spirit and *Yi*—how ultimate, how great!\n\n*The Secret Essentials of the Collected Perfection of the Dao* concludes.",
