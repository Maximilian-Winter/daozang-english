Daozang* (Canon of Daoist Orthodoxy), *Dongzhen* (Vital Essence) section, *Yu Jue* (Jade Precepts) category.\n\n**Preface to the Commentary on the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing***\nThe Dao/Way is boundless, the more one pursues it, the more distant it grows;\nThe utmost truth cannot be confined, the more one measures it, the deeper it becomes.\nThe mysteries of the profound abound—who can hope to grasp them?\nIt is the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing* that does so.\n*Yin* refers to the inner cultivation of the subtle, hidden nature;\n*Fu* refers to the outer alignment with the pure, unified truth.\n\nThe utmost truth transcends and harmonizes with the three essentials (*San Yao*), its essence permeating the nine orifices (*Jiu Qiao*) to subdue their disorders.\nThus, the principle of life and death lies in the eyes.\nIt is not for the deaf and blind, so they may perceive the Dao/Way of Heaven—\ntherefrom emerges the divine illumination, hence called *executing Heaven’s course*.\nThe meaning of this text is that the sacred function must be fully realized here.\n\n**Commentary on the *Huangdi Yin Fu Jing***\n*Yin Fu* is the cultivation of a nature unified with the pure Dao/Way.\nDaoist Hou Shan Yuan of the Maoshu Mountains, surnamed Tai Xuan, offers this commentary.\n\n*Perceiving the Dao/Way of Heaven*—\nthis refers to the divine transformations adapting to the clear, luminous *qi* of the heavens.\n*Executing Heaven’s course* is thus complete.\nWhen one’s *virtue/power* (*De*) aligns with Heaven’s, its mechanism is fully realized here.\n\nHeaven has five *thieves* (*Wu Ze*), those who see them prosper.\nWhen the five phases (*Wu Xing*) are out of order, they will steal one’s fate;\nWhen the five spirits (*Wu Shen*) are misaligned, those who encounter them will prosper on their own.\nThe five thieves lie within the heart, manifesting in Heaven’s operations.\nHeaven’s five thieves originate in the heart;\nThe heart connects with the five spirits, acting upon Heaven.\n\nThe universe lies within the grasp of the hands,\nThe *Ling Shū* (Spirit Pivot) governs transformations—\nlike wielding the mechanism of Heaven and Earth.\nAll ten thousand transformations arise from the body.\nThe ten thousand spirits (*Wàn Shén*) harmonize with transformations;\nThe body embodies the Dao/Way.\n\nHeaven’s nature is humanity (*Rén*).\nHumanity’s heart is the mechanism.\nHumanity’s heart aligns with Heaven’s nature in *virtue/power* (*De*), hence it is the mechanism of the heart.\n\nEstablish Heaven’s Dao/Way to regulate humanity.\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is non-action (*Wu Wei*), self-sufficient and unchanging;\nHumanity’s Dao/Way is interdependent, regulating the heart’s course.\n\nWhen Heaven unleashes a killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise upon the land.\nDragons and serpents also embody Heaven and Earth’s nature;\nTheir rising upon the land is the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s mechanisms of life and death.\n\nWhen humanity unleashes a killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth invert.\nHumanity’s acts of slaughter cause Heaven to invert and Earth to reverse—\nthus, Heaven and humanity together unleash their mechanisms.\nWhen Heaven and humanity act in unison, all transformations find their foundation.\nHumanity’s nature aligns with Heaven’s nature—\ngood and evil transformations, none fail to determine their roots.\nNature has skill and clumsiness, which can be concealed.\nSkillful or clumsy natures all derive from Dao/Way transformations—\nnone escape their inherent principles.\n\nThe disorders of the nine orifices (*Jiu Qiao*):\nIf the ears are not sharp and the eyes are not clear,\nThe essence (*Jing*) will be wasted in vain—\nhow can one attain the truth?\n\nIt lies in the three essentials (*San Yao*):\nThe first is the *Taishi* (Supreme Origin) primal essence;\nThe second is the *Bian Yu* (Illuminating Brightness) universal harmony;\nThe third is the *Taiguang* (Congealed Light) focused cultivation.\nThe governance of these three unities is the essential principle of the utmost Dao/Way.\nThey can be applied in action and stillness.\nIn stillness, the great Dao/Way is silent and heartless;\nIn action, divine responses arise and penetrate the profound mysteries.\n\nFire arises from wood—\nwhen disaster strikes, it must be overcome.\nWood conceals hidden fire—\nwhen disaster strikes, it will reduce its form to ashes;\nWhen humanity has nature, ignorance (*Wu Ming*) will destroy its truth.\n\nTreachery arises from the state—\nwhen the times shift, it will collapse.\nIf one’s self-cultivation is not upright, the spirit will scatter and perish.\nTo know and refine this is to be called a sage.\nTo know preservation and annihilation,\nwithout losing the truth, is to nourish the primal spirit (*Yuan Shen*) well,\nto ascend and merge with the Dao/Way of emptiness—\nthis is the *virtue/power* (*De*) of the sage.\n\nHeaven gives life, Heaven takes life—\nthis is the Dao/Way’s principle.\nLife comes from Heaven’s life-giving;\nDeath comes from Heaven’s killing mechanism—\nlife and death’s mechanisms are the ultimate principles of the Dao/Way.\n\nHeaven and Earth are thieves of all things.\nThings steal from Heaven and Earth, following their transformations.\nAll things are thieves of humanity.\nHumanity steals from all things, calculating its survival.\nHumanity is the thief of all things.\nWhen things reach their extremes, they invert and steal back from humanity.\nThe three thieves (*San Ze*) thus find their due,\nThe three *talents* (*San Cai*) thus find their rest.\nMutual theft in sequence aligns with its nature;\nHeaven, Earth, and humanity’s order finds its natural balance.\n\nHence it is said:\n*Eat in accordance with the times*—\nThus, divine responses (*Shén Yòng*) do not lose their rhythm.\n*Regulate the hundred bones*—\nStirring the mechanisms, all transformations are mastered.\nThe hundred joints (*Bai Guān*) find their truth;\nWhen the One True Essence (*Yī Zhēn*) harmonizes transformations,\nAll ten thousand phenomena find their natural order.\n\nHumanity knows its spirits (*Shén*)\nYet seeks them in external transformations, abandoning the true path.\nThe spirits, however, do not know\nThat the primal truth is truly present, yet daily use is unaware.\nThe means to manifest the spirits is the spirits themselves.\nIt is not to seek external sainthood, but to return to Heaven’s true nature.\n\nThe sun and moon have their numbers—\nTheir eclipses follow their appointed times, their brilliance in accord with their cycles.\nGreat and small have their fixed measures.\nThe utmost divine aligns with the Dao/Way, fixed in its due.\nThus, the sage’s function is born.\n\nThe primal spirit (*Yuan Shen*) manifests its transformations,\nThe utmost Dao/Way is born from it.\nDivine illumination emerges from it.\nThe eyes are free from blemish, the body has an external form beyond itself.\n\nThis is the mechanism of the Dao/Way—\nDivine illumination manifests its transformations,\nThus stealing the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll under Heaven see it,\nThe nature of following transformations is clear—\none has entered the midst of the utmost Dao/Way.\nYet none can truly know it.\nDaily practice without awakening to its principle.\n\nThe noble attains it and remains steadfast in poverty,\nThe noble awakens to it and naturally adheres to its truth.\nThe petty attains it and risks their life,\nThe petty awakens to it but does not focus on its principle—\nthey abandon truth for fleeting gain,\nthus lightly discarding their own life.\n\nThe blind excel in listening,\nWhen divine light is obscured, they excel in discerning what is clear.\n\nThe deaf excel in vision.\nPlugged ears cannot hear—\nthey excel in discerning what is bright.\n\nCutting off one source of profit,\nnot coveting external wealth,\nsteadfastly guarding the singular source of the Dao/Way.\n\nUsing a teacher tenfold,\nguarding the singular without admixture,\nthe teacher’s merit is tenfold.\n\nThreefold reversals of day and night,\ndivine illumination mirrors the Emperor,\nthe utmost Dao/Way is harmonized.\nThreefold unity with the Primordial,\nday and night never stray from its rectitude.\n\nUsing a teacher a thousandfold.\nThreefold unity day and night without loss,\nthe teacher’s merit is a thousandfold.\n\nThe mind arises from things,\nseeing things shifts its nature—\ndivine illumination does not dwell in subtlety.\nIt dies in things,\nthe mind clings to attachments,\nwandering through birth and death.\n\nThe mechanism lies in the eyes.\nThe eyes are the gate and window of the Five Spirits,\nopening and closing hold the mechanism of birth and death.\n\nHeaven’s lack of benevolence gives rise to great benevolence.\nHeaven bestows favor and love,\nnot through human kindness—\nyet great benevolence arises from things following transformation.\n\nSwift thunder and violent winds\nall move sluggishly.\nRaging clouds and sudden storms\nall move sluggishly—\nthey bear Heaven and Earth’s great benevolence and are born.\n\nUtmost joy overflows,\nutmost stillness brings purity.\nHeaven’s benevolence overflows—\nthings’ nature is joyful and abundant,\nstillness returns to the constant Dao/Way,\npurity manifests the utmost divine transformation.\n\nHeaven’s utmost privacy becomes utmost publicness.\nHeaven’s mysterious virtue is without self,\nthus it fulfills its privacy—\nnothing is unused within it,\nthus it attains utmost publicness.\n\nThe making of birds lies in *qi*.\nThe divine and true ascend in feathered transformation,\nbearing Heaven and Earth’s rectified *qi*.\n\nLife is the root of death.\nEntering life’s death,\none emerges from death’s life.\n\nDeath is the root of life.\nEntering death’s life,\none emerges from life’s death.\n\nBenevolence arises from harm.\nThe Dao bestows virtue,\nthings’ nature is harmful—\nharm brings benevolence,\nthus fortune lies hidden in calamity.\n\nHarm arises from benevolence.\nThings’ nature follows transformation,\nbearing the virtue’s benevolence—\nbenevolence brings harm,\nthus calamity leans on fortune.\n\nThe foolish take Heaven and Earth’s patterns and principles as sacred.\n*Yong*—use; *wen*—good and beautiful.\nIf one uses Heaven and Earth’s good and beautiful principles,\n*li*—principle, akin to rectitude—\nrectitude reaches effortless action,\nsubtlety penetrates mysterious transformation,\nfrom the mundane to the sage—\nthis is called utmost truth.\n\nI use the patterns and principles of the times wisely.\nThe sagely grasp employs the times’ things,\ncorrecting their wisdom—\n*zhe*—wisdom, akin to intelligence—\nyet even the sage uses the times’ things,\nentering their mechanisms,\nnever fully attaining sainthood.\n\nOthers rely on foresight and folly,\nI rely on unforeseen sainthood.\nOthers await sainthood,\nI do not await sainthood.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo sink in water and enter fire\nis to court self-destruction.\n\nThe Dao/Way of nature is still,\nthus Heaven and Earth’s ten thousand things are born.\nHeaven and Earth’s Dao/Way is gradual,\nthus yin and yang prevail.\n\nYin and yang push against each other—\ntransformation flows in harmony.\n\nThus the sage knows the Dao/Way of nature cannot be defied,\nand acts accordingly.\n\nThe Dao/Way of utmost stillness\ncannot be measured by calendrical laws.\nYet there are wondrous instruments,\ngiving rise to myriad phenomena.\n\nThe Eight Trigrams and Heavenly Stems,\ndivine mechanisms hidden like ghosts.\nThe arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming\nare clearly revealed in their symbols.\n\n*The Yellow Emperor’s Yin Symbol Classic* commentary ends.",
