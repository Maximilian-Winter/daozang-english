  "full_translation": "**The *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\n**Text Title:** *Dao and Virtue Compendium* (*Daode Huiyuan*)\nAuthor: Li Daochun of the Yuan dynasty\nTwo fascicles, upper and lower\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Yujue* category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\nI humbly observe that Fu Xi drew the *Yi* to reveal the Primordial Heaven, while Laozi composed his book to fully manifest the Dao and virtue. These two works may well be the ancestors of all scriptures. Yet today’s scholars, failing to grasp their principles—how lamentable! The fault lies in not receiving their true transmission.\n\nI, though untrained in letters, sought widely and visited many masters until I encountered a perfected one who unlocked the *Yi* in my heart, allowing me to attain the subtleties of its profound meaning. Thereupon, I exhausted what I had gained and compiled the *Essence of the Three Heavens’ Yi*, which I transmitted to my disciples. Only Laozi’s *Daodejing* remained unmastered.\n\nOne day, a certain Chuan Ji’an brought me the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity. Upon examining its annotations, I found them largely in accord with the text, though some parts were incomplete. I wished to add my own glosses but hesitated after careful reflection.\n\nLater, two or three disciples each presented several commentaries by various masters, seeking my instruction. Comparing them with the original scripture, I found many discrepancies: some had an extra word, others a missing word; some entire sentences diverged, or characters were corrupted. Each had its strengths and weaknesses, yet all differed.\n\nI sighed: If even the original scripture is thus, how much more so the commentaries? When asked the reason, I replied: Initially, copyists made errors. Later, printing blocks had omissions or misalignments, and where earlier interpretations were unclear, later scholars arbitrarily added to them, perpetuating distortions and creating fragmentation.\n\nSomeone asked: Which version is correct?\nI said: The *Zhangju* of Master He Shang and the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity are quite coherent.\nWhy?\nBecause those that align with the logical flow of the text above and below are correct.\n\nWhat of the other interpretations?\nEach reflects a different perspective, clinging to one aspect alone.\n\nMay I ask for details?\nThey stem from private conjecture, not flowing from one’s own insight, and thus cannot be broadly applied. Those versed in governance cling to governance; those in the alchemical Dao, to the alchemical Dao; those in military strategy, to military strategy; those in Chan, to Chan. Some speak of principle but not practice; others, of practice but not principle. As for expedient means, clever schemes, or roundabout paths, they fall into partiality and lose the Sage’s original intent.\n\nLittle do they realize that the Sage’s purpose in composing the scripture was to establish the ultimate before Heaven and Earth, to operate beyond yin and yang. In the space between covering and supporting, every affair and principle is complete—how could one cling to a single aspect and speak of it thus?\n\nThereupon, I ventured to speak, pointing out where others’ interpretations were incoherent or contrary to the Sage’s meaning, presenting them to my disciples. All agreed. Thereafter, seekers came repeatedly, leaving me no choice but silence. I proceeded to add annotations to each line of the original scripture, elucidating its meaning to verify the essentials of nurturing spirit and cultivating qi. For each chapter, I summarized its principle to clarify the sequence of investigating the root and exhausting the source. After each chapter, I composed verses to fully reveal the mechanism of illuminating the mind and seeing one’s nature.\n\nAs for the matters of cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the realm; the regulations and laws; the daily concerns of the common people; and the path of ordinary conduct—whether vast or minute, broad or subtle, nothing is not encompassed within. I further composed two discourses, *Rectifying Words* and *Investigating Principle*, placing them at the scripture’s beginning to clarify proper terminology and thoroughly examine its meaning, thereby resolving the confusions of discrepancies in the text. I titled this work the *Dao and Virtue Compendium*, so that later learners may delve deeply and savor it, entering according to their understanding, and thus avoid falling into partiality, ultimately merging with the supreme Dao and returning to the origin.\n\nThough my words are coarse and unrefined, I have done no more than provide straightforward explanations. I dare not claim the scripture’s meaning as my own. Yet compared to other versions, this may come closer. May those of like mind in later times take note.\n\nWritten on the first day of the fourth lunar month in the *gengyin* year of the Zhiyuan era (1290) by Li Daochun, the Learned One of Clear Hermitage of Duliang, styled Yuánsù.\n\n---\n\n**Prefatory Notes to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\n**Rectifying Words**\n\nAmong the various versions of the scripture I have examined, only the edition by the Venerable He Shang is correct. Even the He Shang edition has three variants: one with He Shang Gong’s annotations, one with two complete commentaries, and one with the *Zhangju* in plain text. Among these, only the plain-text *Zhangju* of the Venerable He Shang is superior in principle, and I have followed it. I have thus exposed the erroneous interpretations of other versions to rectify their deviations. Beyond this, there are over two hundred instances of minor discrepancies, which I shall not enumerate here. This brief account suffices to dispel scholars’ doubts.\n\nIn Chapter Two, the six phrases beginning with \"Being and non-being give birth to one another\" should not each include the word *zhi* (之).\nIn Chapter Three, \"Therefore the Sage empties their heart\" should not be rendered as \"the Sage governs,\" \"governs it,\" or \"governs it thus.\"\nIn Chapter Eleven, the six phrases beginning with \"Embracing the One, can you not part from it?\" should not each include the word *hu* (乎).\nIn Chapter Thirteen, \"Favor is high, disgrace is low\" should not be rendered as \"favor is low,\" which contradicts the scripture’s meaning.\nIn Chapter Sixteen, \"Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter\" should not be rendered as \"together with\" (*yu*, 與) or omit *xi* (兮) in the following three of six phrases.\nIn Chapter Seventeen, \"Next, they fear him; next, they revile him\" should not be rendered as \"they fear and revile him.\"\nIn Chapter Twenty, \"Dim, as if obscured\" should not be rendered as \"bland, as if the sea.\"\n\"Valuing the mother of sustenance\" should not be rendered as \"the child values seeking sustenance from the mother.\"\nIn Chapter Thirty, some versions have three extra characters or one or two missing.\nIn Chapter Thirty-One, \"Victory is not beautiful\" should not be rendered as \"thus it is not beautiful.\"\n\nSome versions render \"love and nurture\" in Chapter Thirty-Four as \"clothing and coverings\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Thirty-Six, dividing \"softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength\" into two phrases is wrong. In Chapter Thirty-Nine, \"counting the parts of a chariot yet having no chariot\" is sometimes misread as \"counting praises\"—this is also incorrect. In Chapter Forty-Nine, adding the particle *yi* (矣) after \"virtue is good, virtue is trustworthy\" is wrong. In Chapter Fifty-Two, \"having served the mother, one knows the child\" is sometimes misconstrued as \"having known the mother, one further knows the child\"—both versions are incorrect. In Chapter Fifty-Five, \"excessive life brings misfortune\" is sometimes rendered as \"daily life\" or \"it is called life\"—both are wrong. Chapter Sixty-Six contains several discrepancies in phrasing. In Chapter Seventy-One, \"to know yet not know\" is sometimes expanded to \"to know yet not know is superior\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Seventy-Seven, \"who can take their surplus to serve the world\" is sometimes interpolated with \"those lacking\"—this is wrong. In Chapter Seventy-Eight, \"nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water\" is sometimes misphrased as \"nothing is softer or weaker than water\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Eighty, \"to cause the possession of tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them\" is sometimes rendered as \"ordering tools\" or \"not using them\"—both are wrong.\n\n**Investigating the Principle**\nExamining the various editions and their interpretations, those that do not align with the Sage’s meaning are here exposed. The discrepancies and errors are numerous, and I do not wish to enumerate them all—scholars should reflect deeply on this.\n\n*\"Always without desire, to observe its mystery\"*\nSome punctuate this as a single phrase, \"always without,\" or claim, \"Those without desire preserve themselves; those with desire perish.\" If those with desire truly perish, why speak of \"together calling it the profound\"? Could perishing be called the profound? I say: \"Without desire\" means acting without contrivance, naturally. \"With desire\" means applying effort with intention. Non-action reveals the mystery of the nameless, preserving one’s nature. Action reveals the thoroughness of the named, preserving one’s life. Being and non-being, nature and life—these emerge from the same source yet bear different names, together called the profound, the profound within the profound. When being and non-being interpenetrate, nature and life are both fulfilled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are expressed, it is called the Center. The Center is the great root of the world—this is the meaning of 'without desire, observe the mystery.' When expressed and all meet their measure, it is called Harmony. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world—this is the meaning of 'with desire, observe its manifestations.' Achieving the Center and Harmony, heaven and earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured—this is the meaning of 'the profound within the profound.'\"\n\nThe term \"desire\" refers to desiring what others do not desire.\n\n*\"Not exalting the worthy\"*\nSome render this as \"not seeking worthy scholars\" or \"not employing the worthy\"—both are incorrect. If the worthy were truly not employed, this scripture would be unworthy of evidence, for such a principle could not exist.\n\n*\"The gate of the mysterious female\"*\nSome identify the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is wrong. Others suggest it refers to where thoughts arise—this is somewhat plausible but still does not align with the scripture’s meaning.\n\n*\"Bearing the *po*\"*\nSome interpret this as \"soul and *po*,\" others as \"yin and yang,\" and there are several other explanations—all are untenable. They fail to recognize that the *po* delights in movement; \"bearing\" it means to govern it.\n\n*\"Thirty spokes\"*\nSome explain this as the number of days in a month, others as the fire of cultivation—both are incorrect. They do not grasp that the Sage’s intent does not lie in the number thirty.\n\n*\"Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom\"*\nSome claim sageliness and wisdom are insufficient and should be discarded—this is wrong. I say: the Sage does not employ sageliness and wisdom to be seen by the people.\n\n*\"Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow\"*\nSome take this to mean \"abandoning learning is not learning\"—this is incorrect. It means abandoning the learning of ordinary people to learn the non-learning of others. \"Abandoning learning\" means abandoning the learning of the world.\n\n*\"To close it, one must first open it\"*\nThe explanations of various schools are incoherent. Some claim it refers to valuing flexibility—this is wrong. The highest Dao does not exalt the worthy; how could it value flexibility?\n\n*\"Rites are the head of disorder\"*\nSome hastily conclude that rites are not worth pursuing—I do not agree. If one can advance from rites to benevolence and righteousness, one nearly approaches the Dao.\n\n*\"Counting the parts of a chariot yet having no chariot\"*\nThe explanations of various schools are incoherent. I say: counting the parts of a chariot, not one is called a chariot—this is a metaphor for my body, not one part of which is called \"I.\"\n\n*\"Those who live are thirteen\"*\nSome claim that of ten parts, three are life and three are death, or that it refers to the seven emotions and six desires—this seems plausible but is not. Others suggest it refers to the four gates and nine orifices, which is even more wrong. Still others compare it to the waxing and waning of the moon as a metaphor for the fire of cultivation—this is also incorrect. For the explanation, see the main text of the scripture.\n\n*\"Do not narrow one’s dwelling\"*\n\nPrevious interpretations fail to cohere. Some offer contrary explanations, claiming it refers to the formless spirit or to boundless vastness—both are incorrect. Others suggest it means \"never weary of one’s life\" or \"never weary of the Dao,\" which is sheer delusion. Have they not heard the concluding line: *\"Abandon that, embrace this\"*?\n\nI say: *\"Do not narrow one’s dwelling\"* still implies grasping at vastness and greed. *\"Never weary of one’s life\"* means defying great majesty and insatiable craving for life. The sage knows the self without displaying it, cherishes the self without exalting it, and does not indulge life—hence *\"abandon that, embrace this.\"*\n\n*\"Those with virtue hold fast to the bond; those without virtue enforce thoroughness.\"*\nSome claim *\"彻\"* means *\"to penetrate,\"* that the sages of antiquity were universally penetrating, nothing escaping their comprehension, while the people, lacking virtue, merely praised them. Such words are like eavesdropping through a wall—utterly unrelated to the scripture’s meaning.\n\nI say: *\"契\"* means *\"pledge\"* or *\"covenant\"* (pronounced *qiè* in rhyme with *挈*). *\"彻\"* means *\"thorough\"* or *\"pervasive.\"* Those with virtue uphold their covenant, while those without virtue enforce their clarity and thoroughness. For details, see the main text of the scripture below—those of insight should reflect deeply.\n\nThis scripture’s phrasing often employs rhyme:\n*\"朴\"* rhymes with *\"扑.\"*\n*\"阙\"* (pronounced *zhá*) rhymes with *\"察察.\"*\n*\"拔\"* (pronounced *bá*) rhymes with *\"脱.\"*\n*\"作\"* (pronounced *zuò*, entering tone) rhymes with *\"复.\"*\nSuch examples are numerous; their pronunciations are noted in the main text. Readers of this scripture must not cling rigidly to the literal meaning of the characters.\n\n*Preface and Examples to the* **Collected Essentials of the Dao and Its Virtue**\n*Collected Essentials of the Dao and Its Virtue, Volume One*\n\n**Composed by Li Daochun Yuanfu of Qing’an, the Pure Toad Hermitage of Duliang**\n\n**Dao**\nThat which can be spoken of as the Dao is not the true and constant Dao. The true and constant Dao begins in the beginningless, is named in the nameless. To conceive or discuss it is already to deviate; to open one’s mouth is already to err. If it could be spoken of, what would the Dao be? Since it cannot be spoken of, how then is the Dao to be perceived? If it is neither what can be spoken nor what cannot be spoken, how then is it to be realized? Should one manage to turn the phrase here, the work of inquiry is complete—if not, one must seek within the twelve hours of the day, in rising and resting, in eating and dwelling, in every moment of turning the mind, to examine and discern what it is that stands so steadfast, so vividly alive, never opposing any condition. Examine and discern again and again, until one reaches the point where examination and discernment fail—suddenly, as if grasping one’s own nostrils, the whole body breaks into sweat. Only then does one realize that this original thing has always been one’s own, unchanged since time immemorial. This is what is meant by the Dao, from which one cannot be parted even for an instant. Again, it is said: in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, one does not depart from this. How much more so between heaven and earth, where every thing and every phenomenon is this, from ancient times to the present, only this—giving birth to heaven and earth, only this. In daily life, in movement and stillness, in activity and rest, it is only this. All that has form will decay, but the nature of this remains constant. Even heaven, earth, and the void will decay, yet this alone does not. This alone cannot be seen through, though not for iron eyes or bronze pupils. Why can it not be seen through? Only because one has never truly encountered it face to face. Even if one were to encounter it face to face, one would still miss it. And where would one have missed it? Do not wander aimlessly—after all, how does one understand it? Here, it is perfectly clear, yet only lacks someone to bear witness to it. Should one meet a true friend, one would raise one’s brows and offer it up.\n\n*Crack!* Last night, new rain passed by the riverbank;\nThis morning, the distant mountains remain as green.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe ultimate of the Dao is emptiness, void, and stillness,\nWithout image, without form, without name, without substance.\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be grasped, cannot be heard,\nNor can its traces be found.\nVast, it encompasses all; subtle, it enters all.\nIt gives birth to heaven and earth, nurtures the ten thousand things,\nIts transformations endless, its hiddenness and manifestation unfathomable.\nIt cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing.\nThe Most High Laozi, whose tongue had no bone,\nIn this scripture, clearly revealed it.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—better to remain silent.\nThis is the end of doubt.\n\n**Virtue/Power**\nThe word *virtue* is also a forced name, impossible to describe or grasp. Any contrivance, accumulation of merit, or layering of practice is not virtue. To remain thus, without cultivation, without effort, like dead ashes or withered wood, waiting for virtue to come of itself—one will have no virtue for a lifetime. The more one seeks virtue, the farther it recedes; the more one clings to it, the more it is lost. The scripture says: “The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.” And again: “The highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose.” These two lines are abundantly clear—only lacking someone to bear witness to them. If one is truly faithful, one will overturn all prior learning, understanding, and knowledge—all the teachings of the Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas—and in the midst of ordinary practice, take up the word *diminish* and put it to use. Diminish again and again, diminishing until one reaches the point where nothing more can be diminished. Then, mysterious virtue shines forth, and one trusts that non-action is indeed beneficial. The scripture says: “The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain it.” And again: “Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching.” Do you understand?\n\n*Hmm!* It does not depart from where it constantly abides,\nYet if sought, you will find it cannot be seen.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe river-sands of wondrous virtues all reside within the mind.\nNo need for effort—why labor to cultivate and accumulate?\nThe more one delves, the deeper it becomes; the more one clings, the more it is lost.\nLet go of all things, overturn all phenomena.\nPut others before oneself, embrace the feminine, hold to the One.\nPure and undivided, one’s virtue becomes real.\nSelf-cultivation, family regulation, governance, and peace—all emerge from this.\nIts wondrous function is immeasurable—this is called mysterious virtue.\n\n**Scripture**\nThe word *scripture* is also a forced name. In the beginning, the sage saw that people followed illusions with their emotions, were deluded by desires, and true nature was lost amid the turmoil of karmic consciousness and the blazing of ignorance. Thus, the original heaven was forsaken, and people suffered premature death and injury, unable to return to their fundamental source. Therefore, using the power of skillful means, the sage opened the gate of good guidance, leading the deluded multitude back to the true Way. Thus, he composed books and established teachings, forcibly naming them *scriptures*. *Scripture* means *path*—the great road traveled by all. Yet those who read this scripture must not cling to the trance of language, nor should they abandon this scripture to seek elsewhere. One must turn one’s attention to one’s own being, carefully chewing over these five thousand words, examining each point and stroke, not letting anything slip by. Suddenly, when one thoroughly digests even a single phrase, this entire scripture resides within oneself. Only then does one trust that the opening of the Dao does not depend on the tongue. Here, one unlocks one’s own treasure store, brings forth one’s own scripture, wields it freely and without constraint. Not only this scripture, but all thirty-six revered scriptures and the entire canon of teachings—from beginning to end, with a single shout, one fully comprehends them all.\n\nA storm rises from level ground,\nA thunderclap splits the clear sky—\nListen carefully, listen carefully!\n\n**Verse:**\nThis single scroll of scripture—\nIts wondrous function is beyond praise.\nEach person inherently possesses it,\nEvery thing is perfectly complete.\nStraightforward and unobstructed,\nVast and unconfined.\nUnchanging through kalpas,\nUnaltered since ancient times.\nEverywhere it functions,\nEverywhere it serves as a thoroughfare.\n\nBefore the hand is raised, clarity is already distinct.\nNone but the true child of my house dares enter within.\n\n\"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\"\nTo open the mouth is already to err.\nWhat name shall it be called?\nThat which can be named is not the eternal name.\nTo call it a thing is already to miss the mark.\n\nNameless, it is the Dao—\nThe beginning of heaven and earth,\nPrior to all covering and bearing.\nNamed, it is forcibly called the Dao—\nThe mother of the ten thousand things,\nGiving life without cease.\n\nThus, in constant non-desire, one observes its mystery;\nIn no-mind, transformation unfolds.\nIn constant desire, one observes its manifestations.\n(Manifestation: *jiào*, pronounced as \"call\"—intentional manipulation.)\n\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names—\nOne substance, two functions.\nTogether they are called the profound,\nFor substance and function share a single source.\nProfound beyond the profound,\nWhere form and spirit are both wondrous—\nThe gateway of the manifold mysteries.\nFrom this arise the hundred thousand dharma gates.\n\n**Chapter One**\nThe Dao of emptiness and natural constancy cannot be spoken.\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\nIt is the primordial ancestral qi,\nThe Dao that transforms and gives birth to all heavens,\nAdapting to time and circumstance.\n\nThe Dao is originally nameless;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nIt is the name that shapes heaven and earth’s transformations,\nNurturing the ten thousand things,\nManifest in form and trace.\n\nWith an empty mind and non-action, one perceives the nameless mystery;\nWith an active mind, one perceives the named manifestations.\nMystery is spirit; manifestation is form.\nTo know manifestation but not mystery is imprecise;\nTo know mystery but not its thoroughness is incomplete.\nOnly when both are fully realized—\nForm and spirit both wondrous—\nIs it called \"profound beyond the profound.\"\nFrom this emerge the thirty-six revered scriptures,\nThe gateway of the manifold mysteries.\n\nWhere, then, does this scripture arise?\n*Hah!*\n\n**Verse:**\nAt Kunlun’s summit,\nWithin the primordial millet-pearl.\nThe mouth born of father and mother\nWill never serve you truly.\n\nWhen all under heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\n(For beauty is the cause of ugliness.)\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness follows.\n(For goodness is the source of un-goodness.)\n\nThus, being and non-being give birth to one another;\nDifficulty and ease complete one another.\n(Ease: *yì*, pronounced as \"ferment\"—what is difficult becomes easy; what is easy becomes difficult.)\nLong and short define one another;\nHigh and low incline toward one another.\n(Where there is height, there is lowness.)\nSound and echo harmonize;\n(Where there is sound, there is harmony.)\nFront and back follow one another.\n(Before follows after; after follows before.)\n\nTherefore, the sage forgets beauty and ugliness,\nAbides in non-action,\nForgets being and non-being.\nPractices the teaching without words,\nForgets difficulty and ease.\nThe ten thousand things arise without refusal,\nForgets things.\nBorn yet not possessed,\nForgets form.\nActs yet does not rely,\nForgets emotion.\nAchieves yet does not dwell.\nForgets self.\nOnly by not dwelling does one remain true to one’s origin—\nThus, it does not depart.\n(Depart: *qù*, pronounced in rising tone—\nWhen all is forgotten, the true unity remains eternally.)\n\n**Chapter Two**\nBeauty and ugliness, goodness and un-goodness,\nLike shadow following form, naturally depend on one another.\nEven being and non-being, difficulty and ease,\nMutually rely and conceal one another.\nWhere there is beauty, there is ugliness;\nWhere there is goodness, there is un-goodness.\nThus, the sage neither refuses nor possesses,\nNeither relies nor dwells,\nForgets both self and other,\nLets being and non-being dissolve—\nAnd so remains eternally, never departing.\n\nThis chapter elucidates the meaning of embodying the Dao from the first,\nEnabling the learner to understand the principle of \"emerging together yet bearing different names,\"\nNeither clinging to function nor abandoning it,\nAvoiding partiality and stagnation.\n\n**Verse:**\nPeople have beauty and ugliness;\nI have no self or other.\nAll overturned—\nA hundred bubbles return to water.\nThough a thousand existences are pointed out before me,\nI say within them there is not a single one.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy,\nAbandon sageliness and discard wisdom—\nLet the people not contend.\n(Forget self.)\nDo not value rare goods,\nAbandon craft and discard profit—\nLet the people not steal.\n(Forget things.)\nDo not display what is desirable,\nTurn things to respond to the moment—\nLet the heart not be confused.\n(Forget emotion.)\n\nThus, the sage empties the mind,\nPreserves essence.\nFills the belly,\nPreserves life.\nWeakens the will,\nPreserves spirit.\nStrengthens the bones,\nPreserves form.\nAlways lets the people be without knowledge or desire,\nEmptying all that is possessed.\nLets those with knowledge not dare to act.\n(Those who recognize the dharma fear.)\nAct through non-action,\nStill and unmoving—\nThen nothing is not governed.\n(Govern: *zhì*, pronounced as \"hold\"—\nResponding, one penetrates all.)\n\n**Chapter Three**\n\"Not exalting the worthy\" continues the non-action of the previous chapter.\nTo not boast of one’s own worthiness is to make the people pure;\nTo not value rare goods is to make the people prosperous;\nTo not display what is desirable is to settle the heart.\nThe sage governs the world by taking self-cultivation as the foundation.\n\nEmptying the mind and filling the belly—\nThese are the essentials of cultivation.\nEmpty the mind, then the will weakens;\nWeaken the will, then knowledge ceases;\nCease knowledge, then forget self—\nThis is \"not exalting the worthy.\"\nFill the belly, then the bones strengthen;\nStrengthen the bones, then desire ceases;\nCease desire, then forget things—\nThis is \"not valuing rare goods.\"\nThese two principles support one another,\nSufficient to complete essence and life.\n\n**Verse:**\nWith a full belly, true constancy abides;\nWith an empty mind, the Dao naturally dwells.\nNo need to wield a blade—\nWith a laugh, the cosmos is settled.\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible,\nLike the great void, of one body with it.\nPerhaps it does not fill.\n(It does not overflow.)\nAbysmal, it seems the ancestor of the ten thousand things.\n(It does not display itself.)\nBlunt its sharpness,\n(Do not reveal its edge.)\nUntangle its knots,\n(Do not follow worldly changes.)\nSoften its light,\n(Do not shine alone.)\nBlend with the dust,\n(Do not assert oneself.)\nDeep and still, it seems to endure.\n(Constantly responding, constantly still.)\n\nI do not know whose child it is—\nIt precedes the Supreme Emperor.\n(Only the Dao is the body.)\n\nThese four chapters above speak of acting through non-action, thus following with *\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible—perhaps it does not fill,\"* which means it does not overflow of itself. One who does not overflow of himself must receive benefit. To blunt sharpness and untangle knots is to empty the center and forget the self. *\"I do not know whose child it is—it precedes the Supreme Emperor\"* transcends the bounds of emptiness and nothingness.\n\n**Verse:**\nNot knowing whose child it is,\nHow could one know it precedes the Supreme Emperor?\nFor you, I make it clearly known—\nIt was before the Great Ultimate was divided.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nThey act through non-action,\nTreating the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThey nurture the ten thousand things yet do not claim mastery.\nThe sage is not benevolent,\nEmulating Heaven,\nTreating the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe myriad people return to him yet he does not claim mastery.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIt is empty at the center,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible in use.\nEmpty yet never depleted,\nWithout intent,\nMoving yet ever more emerges.\nResponding to change without end.\nThe more words are spoken, the sooner they fail—\nIt is better to guard the center,\nTo be empty at the center, and nothing more.\n\nThese five chapters above:\nHeaven covers and Earth bears,\nTransforming the people and nurturing things—\nThis may be called utmost benevolence.\nTo speak of \"not benevolent\" is to forget their origin.\nThe sage, in loving the people and governing the state, is likewise;\nIn cultivating the self and nourishing life, he is likewise.\nThis concludes the meaning of *\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\n**Verse:**\nBottomless, it is called the bellows;\nThree holes, it is called the flute.\nWithin, a single aperture—\nNo one can grasp it.\nIf one could grasp it, he would be lord,\nBlowing forth soundless music.\n\n*\"The valley spirit does not die,\"*\nEmpty and numinous, it does not fade.\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate,\nOpening and closing,\nIs called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nIt generates Heaven and generates Earth,\nEnduring ceaselessly, without rest or pause.\nIts use is never forced,\nIts application is inexhaustible.\n\nThese six chapters above:\n*\"The valley spirit does not die\"*—\nEmpty and numinous, it does not fade.\nContinuing the meaning of *\"guarding the center\"* from the previous chapter.\nEmpty and numinous, its transformations are boundless;\nYin and Yang are unfathomable.\nOpening and closing without cease,\nComing and going without end—\nNone know its limit.\nIn movement and stillness, it is without flaw,\nWithout labor or effort,\nGenerating and transforming without end.\n\n**Verse:**\nOpening and closing in accord with Heaven and Earth,\nThis is the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nSince there is no going out or coming in,\nIt alone is honored across the Three Realms.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure without rest or pause.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring\nIs that they do not live for themselves—\nWithout intent,\nThus they can be long-enduring,\nUnchanging and unshifting.\nTherefore the sage emulates Heaven:\nPlacing himself behind, he finds himself ahead—\nForgetting the self.\nSetting himself aside, he finds himself preserved—\nForgetting form.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he accomplishes his self.\nBecause he has no self,\nThus he fulfills himself.\n\nThese seven chapters above:\nHeaven does not act as Heaven of itself,\nEarth does not act as Earth of itself—\nThus they generate without cease.\nThe sage does not act as sage of himself—\nThus he harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth.\nThis continues the meaning of *\"Its use is never forced.\"*\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Dao is utterly empty,\nThis emptiness has no beginning.\nWhoever penetrates this emptiness\nBecomes one body with the Great Void.\nThe Tai Lake spans thirty-six thousand acres—\nTo whom would the moon in its waves speak?\n\nThe highest virtue is like water,\nAbiding in lowliness with softness.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend,\nAdapting to square or round.\nIt dwells where the multitude disdain,\nAble to embrace the foul and impure—\nThus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nNear, level tone: in accord with the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth,\nBenefiting things.\nThe mind is good when deep,\nReceptive to things.\nIn giving, it is good with kindness,\nGenerating things.\nIn speech, it is good with sincerity,\nResponding to things.\nIn governance, it is good with order,\nTransforming things.\nIn affairs, it is good with ability,\nCompleting things.\nIn action, it is good with timing,\nIn harmony with things.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it is without blame—\nThings and self as one.\n\nThese eight chapters above:\nContinuing the previous chapter’s *\"Placing himself behind, he finds himself ahead.\"*\nThe meaning of water is to take softness, humility, and lowliness,\nBenefiting things without contention—\nThus it is without blame.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithout contention, the spirit is serene,\nNaturally the qi is harmonious.\nLet go of this little thing,\nHow many times has the Yellow River run clear?\n\nTo hold and fill it\nIs not as good as stopping.\nAlready, yǐ tone: to cease.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the humble.\nTo measure and sharpen it\nCannot be long preserved.\nMeasure, chǔi tone.\nEarth’s Dao transforms the full and flows to the humble.\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nNone can guard them.\nGhosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble.\nWealth and honor with arrogance\nBring their own misfortune.\nYí, departing tone; jiù, rising tone.\nHuman Dao detests the full and favors the humble.\nWhen merit is achieved and fame is established,\nWithdraw—\nGather and return.\nHeaven’s Dao.\nHeaven and Earth harmonize their virtue.\n\nThese nine chapters above:\n*\"To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping\"* continues the meaning of *\"The highest virtue is like water.\"*\n*\"When merit is achieved and fame is established, withdraw\"* is the warning against fullness and the exhortation to humility.\n\n**Verse:**\nHurrying forward, the shadow does not leave;\nReturning, one falls into the pit.\nJust now, stop where your feet stand—\nThe land becomes level and deep.\nIf you understand turning the body with a little effort,\nHiding or soaring are all at your will.\n\nCarry the hun and po,\nDo not let them wander recklessly.\nEmbrace the One—can you not let it go?\nTwo things mixed in harmony,\nLike a mother carrying her infant.\nConcentrate the qi to attain softness—\nCan you be like an infant?\nPure and undivided,\nReturning to simplicity and wholeness.\nCleanse and purify the mysterious mirror—\nCan you be without flaw?\nNot seeing, not hearing,\nDust-free and mirror-bright.\nLove the people and govern the state—\nCan you act without action?\nZhì tone: to govern.\nUnmoving and unshaken,\nThe Dao flourishes and the times are clear.\nThe gate of Heaven opens and closes—\nCan you be the female?\nGoing out to being, entering to non-being,\nWithout boasting or pride.\nUnderstanding the four directions—\nCan you be without knowledge?\nDiminish cleverness, set aside wisdom,\nHarmonizing light and blending with dust.\nGiving life and nurturing,\nXù, entering tone.\nRevolving the Four Virtues,\nNurturing the multitudes.\nGiving life yet not possessing,\nAchieving merit and fulfilling the Way,\nConcealing traces and hiding form.\nActing yet not relying,\nForgetting its origin,\nSilent and obscure.\n\nLong yet not controlling—\n*Long*, rising tone.\nRetreating to leave room,\nAll entrusted to Heaven’s renewal.\nThis is called the Mysterious Power.\n\nThe Dao ascends, virtue is complete,\nDetached from form, the True is preserved whole.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\"Bearing the po-soul\"—\nLike a cart bearing goods, the po delights in movement,\nIn galloping, in hardness and sharpness—hence \"bearing the po.\"\nThe po belongs to yin; when yin flourishes, it harms yang.\nWhen emotions prevail, they enslave the nature.\nOnly by embracing the One without parting\nCan one attain softness, flawlessness, non-action,\nFemininity, and non-knowing—\nThus restraining the po’s unruly emotions.\nWhen the po is subdued and yin dissolves,\nThe spirit is serene, the nature still.\n\n\"Giving life and nurturing\"—\nGiving life yet not possessing,\nForgetting its origin—\nNo need for restraint,\nNaturally unmoving,\nLike returning laden with treasures.\nThus, \"bearing the po.\"\nFrom \"embracing the One\" onward,\nAll speaks to the meaning of \"bearing the po,\"\nLinking the previous chapter’s \"achieving merit and withdrawing\"\nTo the following chapter’s \"thirty spokes share one hub,\"\nWhich serves the cart’s function.\n\n**Verse:**\nAffairs resolve when the heart is empty—\nYet emptiness is most difficult.\nIn an instant of awakening,\nAfter delusion, a thousand mountains lie between.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nLike the myriad dharmas uniting in one mind.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the cart—there is no cart.\nThe cart’s use arises when spokes converge at the hub,\nCompleting the cart’s function.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel—\n*Mold*, *shàn*, level tone.\nHarmonizing earth to form a vessel.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the vessel—there is no vessel.\nThe vessel’s use arises from the union of water and earth,\nCompleting the vessel’s function.\n\nCarve doors and windows to make a room—\nOpening doors, hollowing windows.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the room—there is no room.\nThe room’s use arises when doors and windows allow passage,\nCompleting the room’s function.\n\nThus, being serves to benefit,\nUsing being to aid non-being.\nNon-being serves as the function,\nUsing non-being to employ being.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven (continued)**\nThe hub’s convergence of spokes enables the cart’s use—\nJust as all dharmas return to the mind,\nThe marvel of preserving the spirit whole.\nWithout spokes converging at the hub, how can it be called a cart?\nWithout dharmas returning to the mind, how can the spirit be realized?\nThe hub is empty within, allowing the cart to move;\nThe mind is empty within, allowing the spirit to adapt.\nThus, emptiness becomes the true benefit,\nBeing becomes the function of emptiness.\nEmptiness and being communicate,\nComing and going without obstruction—\nThis is the meaning of \"bearing the po\" from the previous chapter.\nWhen nothing remains to bear,\nHub and spokes are both forgotten,\nThe cart ceases to exist—\nJust as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,\nThe spirit returns to emptiness.\nVessels and rooms share this principle.\n\n**Verse:**\nA thousand iron walls,\nTen thousand silver mountains.\nTurn the wheel of mechanism,\nAnd pass straight through.\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\nEyes dazzled by color.\nThe five sounds deafen the ears—\nEars confused by noise.\nThe five flavors dull the mouth—\nThe mouth deceived by taste.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart—\nThe heart driven by emotion.\nRare goods hinder conduct—\n*Conduct*, falling tone.\nThe mind turned by things.\n\nThus, the sage tends to the belly, not the eyes—\n*Tends*, falling tone.\nThe inner realm does not go out,\nThe outer realm does not enter.\nThus, rejecting that, embracing this—\n*Reject*, *qù*, *qiāng-lǚ* cut.\nWithdrawing sight, returning to hearing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve (continued)**\nThe previous chapter expounded the function of emptiness—\nWhen its function is empty, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.\nThus, it is followed by \"the five colors blind the eyes.\"\nColors, sounds, flavors, and things are all root-and-dust.\nAll worldly people are robbed by them,\nOnly the Daoist is not deceived.\nSeeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—\nWithout ritual, do not engage.\nThen the six thieves transform into the six spiritual penetrations.\nThus, rejecting that, embracing this.\n\n**Verse:**\nSeeing color, the spirit is unsteady;\nHearing sound, great harmony is lost.\nYet nothing is overturned—\nWith empty hands, the highest realm is built.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace both startle—\nFavor is the precursor of disgrace.\nValuing great trouble as one’s body—\nValuing is the beginning of trouble.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace both startle\"?\nListen closely to what follows.\nFavor is above, disgrace is below—\nFavor is gain.\nThus, gaining it startles as if losing,\nLosing it startles as if gaining.\nThis is called \"favor and disgrace both startle.\"\nSo it is.\n\nWhat is meant by \"valuing great trouble as one’s body\"?\nA question.\nWhy do I have great trouble?\nBecause I have a body—\n*Have*, falling tone, same below.\nWith a body comes trouble.\nWhen I am without a body—\nForgetting form, free from burdens—\nWhat trouble could I have?\nForgetting honor, free from trouble.\n\nThus, one who values the body for the world—\nThose who set the body aside,\nThose who value the body—\nCan be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves the body for the world—\nThose who put the body last,\nThose who cherish the body—\nCan be relied upon with the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen (continued)**\nFollowing the previous chapter’s \"tending to the belly, not the eyes,\"\nThe meaning of forgetting the self.\nThus, it is followed by \"favor and disgrace both startle.\"\nFavor, disgrace, honor, and trouble are mutually dependent.\nIf one can anticipate trouble and guard against it,\nThere will be no trouble for a lifetime.\nExtending this Dao to govern and pacify the world,\nThe world will forever be free from peril.\nThose who rule a state and worry for the world as for their own bodies\nWill have the world willingly embrace them without weariness.\n\n**Verse:**\nWhat disgrace is there in disgrace?\nWhat honor is there in honor?\nGuarding against faults in advance\nIs still like traveling a path.\nHow much better to lay down the whole body,\nWithout gain or loss, without startling.\n\n---\n\nInvisible, it is called *yí*—\nThe great image has no form.\nInaudible, it is called *xī*—\nThe great sound is soundless.\nIntangible, it is called *wēi*—\nThe Dao is hidden, without name.\nThese three cannot be further questioned—\nHow could they be explained?\nThus, they merge into one.\nDifferent paths, same return.\n\nAbove, it is not bright—\nNothing is more hidden than the obscure.\nBelow, it is not dark—\nNothing is more manifest than the subtle.\nEndless, it cannot be named—\nThough it has structure, it truly has no name.\n\nReturning to where there is no thing,\nConcealing the self where no traces remain—\nThis is called \"the form of no-form,\"\nInvisible yet intimately seen.\n\"The image of no-image\"—\n*Xiàng* read in the third tone.\nIntimately seen yet not seen—\nThis is called \"dim and indistinct.\"\nVast and boundless, deep and abyssal.\nApproach it, yet its beginning is unseen—\nNo origin.\nFollow it, yet its end is unseen—\n*Hoù* read in the third tone.\nNo end.\nGrasping the ancient Dao, non-action,\nTo govern the present’s being, to unify the ten thousand beings.\nKnowing the ancient origin, non-action—\nThis is called the Dao’s discipline.\nThrough non-being, manifesting being.\n\n**Right Chapter Fourteen:**\n*Xī*, *yí*, *wēi*—the Dao’s utmost.\nMerging into one, returning to the root.\nNeither bright nor dark, harmonizing its light.\nNo image, no form, concealing its function.\nThe final line summarizes the preceding three chapters\nAnd reveals the secret of the following one.\n\n**Verse:**\nThis target of words is hard to grasp, hard to depict—\nEight-sided and flawless, without seam or crevice.\nDim and indistinct, yet within the obscure there is image—\nWho could discuss such subtle truths?\n\nThe ancients who were adept as scholars\nPreserved its formless state:\nSubtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating,\nPure, luminous, and bright—\nSo deep it cannot be known.\nLook for it, yet it is not seen.\n\nJust because it cannot be known,\nWe force descriptions upon it—\n*Qiang* (read in rising tone):\nWith being, we meet non-being.\n\nCautious, as if crossing a river in winter,\nChill piercing to the bone.\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—\nVigilant in solitude.\nSolemn, as if ice about to melt—\nWithout doubt.\nSimple, as if uncarved wood—\n*Pǔ* (like one dull of wit).\nVast, as if an empty valley—\nHollow within.\nTurbid, as if muddied waters—\n*Hún* (read in level tone),\nOne with the dust.\n\nWho can stir the turbid to slowly clarify?\nClarity is the source of turbidity.\nWho can remain still to slowly quicken?\nStillness is the mechanism of movement.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness—\nEmptiness is the root of fulfillment.\nOnly by not being full,\nCan one be empty and receptive.\nThus, the worn does not become new—\nBurying brilliance, leveling ornament.\n\n**Right Chapter Fifteen:**\nContinuing the meaning of the Dao’s discipline from the previous chapter.\nIlluminating for later learners:\nPreserve sincerity, cultivate reverence,\nAlways be vigilant in solitude,\nDo not cling to appearances but embrace the One,\nAnd abide in emptiness in daily practice.\nWhen all conditions suddenly cease,\nAnd the myriad illusions melt away—\nStir it, and it does not become turbid;\nSettle it, and it does not become clear.\nThis is called \"subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating\"—\nDeeply hidden.\n\n**Verse:**\nSubtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating,\nTurning with the tread of men.\nBlindfold the eyes,\nAnd nothing is seen.\nBetter to return—\nRecognize the face of the Void Sovereign.\n\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nGuard deep stillness.\nMotionless and serene—\nYet the ten thousand things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nObserving return, one knows transformation.\n\nThe things, teeming and diverse,\nEach returns to its root—\nMovement at its extreme reverts to stillness.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nReturning to the source.\nThis is called \"restoring life’s mandate\"—\nThe vitality of life resides here.\nRestoring life’s mandate is called constancy—\nAbiding thus through kalpas.\nKnowing constancy is called illumination—\nLucid through past and present.\n\nNot knowing constancy—\nDeluded and confused.\nActing recklessly brings misfortune—\nA grievous error.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing—\nGreatness admits no exclusion.\nEmbracing, one is impartial—\nImpartiality is kingly.\nImpartial, one transforms all things—\nKingly, one accords with Heaven.\nAccord with Heaven, one accords with the Dao—\nHow could there be an end or limit?\nThe Dao is enduring—\nInexhaustible.\nThough the body perishes, it does not cease—\nThough heaven and earth change, this does not change.\n\n**Right Chapter Sixteen:**\nContinuing from the previous chapter’s \"adept as scholars.\"\nAttaining emptiness and deep stillness,\nRestoring life’s mandate and returning to the root—\nAll is wondrous and divine,\nAll converge here with discerning eyes.\nThe work of learning is complete.\nIf not yet so, delve further into the final lines.\n\n**Verse:**\nAttain emptiness to know the wondrous root,\nIn deepest stillness, see the heart of Heaven.\nGrasp the meaning within,\nAnd all the sands of the river are gold.\n\nThe Highest—\nNo height surpasses it.\nBelow, people merely know of its existence—\nAll acknowledge its presence.\nNext are those who draw near and praise it—\nTo be near and praised is not natural.\nNext are those who fear it—\nAware of its awe and reverence.\nNext are those who insult it—\nUtterly without restraint.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, the Dao is hard to believe—\nSome do not trust.\nDoubt runs deep.\nThus, it treasures its words—\nLight promises, few fulfillments.\n\nWhen merit is accomplished and fame achieved,\nSilently it is brought to fruition—\nThe hundred clans all deem it their own nature,\nUnaware of its origin.\n\n**Right Chapter Seventeen:**\n\"The Highest\" means no height surpasses it.\nThough even the lowest know of this principle,\nThey may draw near—\nYet praise renders it unnatural.\nThose who fear it are but a step removed,\nWhile those who insult it have strayed far from the Dao.\nHeavenly truth is lost,\nUnable to return to the source—\nThough taught, what benefit is there?\nThe more words, the less trust.\nBetter to remain silent and await it,\nAct without contrivance and transform,\nAllowing them to awaken on their own,\nNaturally returning to simplicity—\nUnspoken, yet trusted.\n\nIn terms of governance:\nBelow the Highest, none can act without contrivance.\nDrawing near and praising—\nThis is teaching with words.\nThose who fear it—\nThis is the restraint of punishment.\nThose who insult it—\nThe ruler has lost trust.\nWhen the ruler loses trust in the people,\nThe people do not trust in return.\nThus, it treasures its words—\nTeaching without words.\nTeaching without words,\nAccomplishing without contrivance—\nPunishment is unused, yet the people submit.\nWhen merit and fame are achieved,\nAnd simplicity is restored,\nNearness, praise, fear, and insult are all forgotten.\nThe hundred clans live in peace, delighting in custom,\nForgetting their origin—\nThus, they say, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Highest has no height above,\nYet abides in daily use.\nPity the blind fools,\nWho claim it emerged from the Han Pass.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness—\nOnce the great simplicity scatters, benevolence and righteousness arise.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, there is great deceit—\n*Chū* (read in departing tone):\nWisdom and intelligence—\nRooted in the dust of the senses and karmic consciousness.\nWhen the six relations are not harmonious, there are filial children—\nBetter to abide in constant harmony.\nWhen the state is dark and chaotic, there are loyal ministers—\nBetter to abide in constant order.\n\n**Right Chapter Eighteen:**\nContinuing the meaning of nearness, praise, fear, and insult from the previous chapter.\nRather than a chaotic state revealing loyal ministers,\nWhy not act without contrivance so the people transform themselves?\n\n**Verse:**\nCleverness obscures the great root,\nWisdom loses heavenly truth.\nWithout affairs, abide in constant clarity—\nCarefree and joyful.\n\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom—\nAct without contrivance.\nThe people’s benefit is a hundredfold—\nAt peace and still.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nAct without intent.\nThe people return to filial piety and compassion—\nHarmonious and compliant.\nAbandon skill, discard profit—\nAct without desire.\nThere are no thieves or bandits—\nContentment is constant.\n\n**Verse Nineteen:**\nUnfolding the essence of the preceding chapter.\nWhen sagacity, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit are all abandoned and no longer employed,\nThe people follow this transformation and return to simplicity.\n\nThe Sage, fearing later scholars might prove unequal to the burden,\nAttaches to it the principle of ease and plainness:\n\"Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nBe without cunning, without guile.\nReduce self-interest, diminish desire.\nForget things, forget the self.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nLet not the three minds run wild,\nNor permit a single thought to rage.\nSights, sounds, knowledge, and perception—\nNo longer subject to reflection.\n\nAbandon learning, be without care.\nNo affairs weigh upon the heart.\n*Wei* and *ah*—\nHow far apart?\nNot far.\nGood and evil—\nHow distant?\nVastly so.\n\nWhat people fear,\nOne cannot but fear.\nGood and evil are to be feared.\nHow boundless and unending!\n\nThe common folk bustle and rejoice,\nAs if feasting at a grand sacrifice,\nAs if ascending a springtime terrace—\nInsatiable in their cravings.\n\nI alone remain still, without sign,\nLike an infant who has not yet learned to smile—\nSerene and desireless.\nAdrift, as if with no place to return.\n\nFlowing with natural spontaneity,\nThe common folk all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem to lack—\nThose driven by greed and striving are ever anxious,\nThose who forget scheming are ever joyful.\n\nHow muddled is this heart of mine!\nTurbid and still,\nDim and silent.\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nWhile I alone seem benighted;\nThe common folk display their treasures outwardly,\nThe sage conceals illumination within.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nWhile I alone remain dull and obscure.\nDull as a closed gate.\nThe common folk make distinctions,\nThe sage knows no \"this\" nor \"that.\"\n\nVague as dusk,\nUnknowing, unperceiving.\nDrifting as if without destination,\nNothing grasped, nothing clung to.\nThe common folk all have their uses,\nWhile I alone seem stubborn and coarse.\nThe common folk all possess abilities,\nThe sage alone appears without skill.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nNot taking the ten thousand phenomena as companions,\nYet I prize feeding at the Mother’s breast—\nPrizing the savor of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\nTo \"abandon learning\" is to relinquish all that one possesses,\nThus it follows the abandonment of the sage.\nThe common folk devote themselves to learning matters,\nAugmenting what they have heard,\nEver fearful their progress is not refined—\nThus they are ever anxious.\nThe sage discards all possession,\nDevoting himself solely to savoring the Dao,\nAs one seeks nourishment from the Mother,\nAbiding in femininity and embracing the One—\nThus he is without care.\nThis is called \"abandoning learning to be without care.\"\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe moment one speaks of abandoning learning,\nThe mouth has already erred.\nVast knowledge and wide discernment\nLead one further astray unawares.\nThough all worldly affairs are forgotten,\nOne still falls into the second mechanism of another’s design.\n\nThe bearing of great virtue\nAccommodates all without exception,\nFollowing only the Dao.\nAt ease within the dharma.\n\nThe Dao as a thing—\nOnly vague, only elusive.\nThe Heaven of original nature.\nElusive, yet within it there are images;\nThis is the undifferentiated Heaven.\nVague, yet within it there are things;\nThis is the luminous Heaven.\nDark and deep, within it there is essence;\nThis is the enduring Heaven.\nIts essence is utterly real,\nPure and without falsity.\nWithin it there is sincerity—\nVibrant and alive.\n\nFrom ancient times to the present,\nIts name has never departed,\nEver abiding through kalpas.\nBy this, the myriad beginnings are surveyed.\nHow do I know the nature of the myriad beginnings?\nBy this.\n\nThe preceding twenty-one chapters—\nThe previous chapter states, \"I alone differ from others, for my virtue is great.\"\nThus follows \"The bearing of great virtue,\" speaking of its vast embrace and all-encompassing nature.\nWhat then is this \"Dao as a thing\"? What thing is it?\nWith images, with things, with essence—does it truly exist?\nTo call it existent, one lacks the eye of practiced insight;\nTo call it nonexistent, one equally lacks the eye of practiced insight.\nHow, after all, is it to be understood? Hmph!\n\n**Verse:**\nFrom ancient times, a single thing—\nYet none have known it.\nRaise your brows, and bare bone appears in empty space.\nShould you hesitate or deliberate,\nA thunderclap splits the void.\n\nBent, it remains whole;\nThe unhewn tree endures.\nTwisted, it straightens;\nTo yield is to extend.\nHollow, it fills—\n*Wā*, deep as a gourd.\nHumble, it gains.\nWorn, it renews;\nObscured, it shines of itself.\nLittle, it attains;\nTo know cessation is lasting sufficiency.\nMuch, it confounds;\nAffairs in excess breed chaos.\n\nThus the sage embraces the One as the model for all under Heaven.\nThe One governs the many.\nNot self-displaying, thus luminous;\nWorn, it renews.\nNot self-asserting, thus distinguished;\nHollow, it fills.\nNot self-boasting, thus meritorious;\nTwisted, it straightens.\nNot self-exalting, thus exalted.\nBent, it remains whole.\nOnly through non-contention,\nHolding to softness,\nDoes none under Heaven contend with him.\nBlended into oneness.\n\nThe ancient saying \"Bent, it remains whole\"—was this empty words?\nIt is true and real speech.\nIn perfect sincerity, return to it.\nPreserve its original wholeness.\n\nChapter Twenty-Two\nBent yet whole, crooked yet straight,\nHollow yet full, worn yet renewed—\nthese continue the preceding chapter’s discourse on the virtue of the profound.\nFrom \"Not self-displaying\" onward,\nall warn against excess and exhort humility.\nHumble and lowly, thus without contention;\nwithout contention, one preserves one’s original wholeness,\nembraces the primordial and guards the One,\nreturning to the boundless.\nHence it is said: \"In perfect sincerity, return to it.\nPreserve its original wholeness.\"\n\n*Verse:*\nHeed not the faults of others,\nNor boast of your own strengths.\nFaults and strengths—no dual vision,\nNowhere can they be concealed.\n\n\"Few words accord with nature.\"\nSpeech lies not in the tongue.\n\"Whirlwinds do not last the morning,\nViolence does not endure.\"\n\"Sudden rains do not last the day.\"\nImpatience does not long prevail.\nWho brings this about?\nWho is the master?\nHeaven and Earth—\nall know this.\nYet even Heaven and Earth cannot last forever;\nhow much less can man?\nThus one who engages with the Dao\nfollows principle and aligns with the track.\n\nThose who accord with the Dao are one with the Dao;\nunity is seen as one.\nThose who accord with virtue are one with virtue;\nno single view arises.\nThose who accord with loss are one with loss;\nno distinctions exist.\nThose who are one with the Dao,\nthe Dao delights in attaining them—\nI am one with the Dao, the Dao is one with me.\nThose who are one with virtue,\nvirtue delights in attaining them—\nI am one with virtue, virtue is one with me.\nThose who are one with loss,\nloss delights in attaining them—\nI am one with loss, loss is one with me.\n\"Trust is insufficient, thus disbelief arises.\"\nI doubt things, things doubt me.\n\nChapter Twenty-Three\n\"Few words accord with nature\"—\nthis continues the preceding chapter’s discourse on non-contention.\n\"Not self-displaying\" means responding well without speaking.\n\"Whirlwinds and sudden rains\"\nare metaphors for reckless action and impetuous advance that do not last.\nOne who engages with the Dao\nharmonizes with virtue and power,\nblends with all things,\nnaturally resonates with them,\nand things naturally respond in kind.\nIf one’s words do not accord with the Dao,\nor one acts recklessly,\none cannot gain others’ trust,\nbut is instead slighted by them.\nThe *Book of Changes* says:\n\"Words and deeds are the hinge and spring of the noble one,\nthe master of honor and disgrace—\nhow can one not be cautious?\"\n\n*Verse:*\nThe Dao is not different from people,\nPeople merely deem it so.\nOne Buddha is all Buddhas,\nThe mind is the ground of the Tathāgata.\n\n\"One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm\"—\nimpetuous advance yields no merit.\n\"One who strides cannot walk\"—\nhaste does not bring success.\n\"One who self-displays is not luminous\"—\ncannot conceal one’s power.\n\"One who self-asserts is not distinguished\"—\ncannot humble oneself.\n\"One who self-boasts has no merit\"—\ncannot restrain oneself.\n\"One who self-exalts does not endure\"—\ncannot contain oneself.\nIn relation to the Dao, these are called\n\"leftover food and redundant conduct.\"\nRedundant growths and excess.\nThings may revile them—\nall find them unlovely.\nThus one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in them.\nThe enlightened act otherwise.\n\nChapter Twenty-Four\nThis chapter collectively confirms the preceding three.\n\"One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm,\nOne who strides cannot walk\"—\nthis refers to \"whirlwinds and sudden rains.\"\n\"Self-displaying, self-asserting,\nself-exalting, self-boasting\"—\nall are private intentions.\nPrivate intentions, once fixed, harm the public—\nhow can they endure?\nThus one who possesses the Dao does not dwell in them.\n\"Leftover food and redundant conduct\" are unlovely.\n\n*Verse:*\nStanding on tiptoe is fundamentally delusion,\nStriding is inherently madness.\nEven if one succeeds in some affair,\nIn the end it is not as good as constancy.\n\nThere is a thing, chaotically formed—\nthis is Heaven’s undifferentiated state.\nBorn before Heaven—\nthis is Heaven’s transparent state.\nSilent, empty, profoundly still—\nit stands alone, unchanging,\ntranscendent and self-existent.\nIt revolves without end—\nits transformations are inexhaustible.\nIt may be called the Mother of all under Heaven,\nnurturing and sustaining all.\nI do not know its name—\nit is fundamentally nameless.\nI style it \"Dao\"—\na name given in response to things.\nForcibly, I name it \"Great.\"\nBoundless.\n\"Great\" means \"passing away\"—\nwithout boundaries.\n\"Passing away\" means \"far-reaching\"—\nwithout limits.\n\"Far-reaching\" means \"returning\"—\ngathering and returning.\nThus the Dao is great,\nthe Great Void without form.\nHeaven is great—\nit models itself on the Dao.\nEarth is great—\nit models itself on Heaven.\nThe king is also great—\nhe models himself on Earth.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats—\nis there yet another great?\nThe king occupies one of them—\nalone he is honored in the Three Realms.\nMan models himself on Earth—\nnothing is not borne.\nEarth models itself on Heaven—\nnothing is not contained.\nHeaven models itself on the Dao—\nnothing is not encompassed.\nThe Dao models itself on nature.\n\nChapter Twenty-Five\nThis chapter follows the preceding, which states that \"one who possesses the Dao does not dwell\" in such things,\nand here elucidates the work of dwelling in the Dao.\nFrom \"There is a thing, chaotically formed\" onward,\nthe entire passage is the essential teaching of embodying the Dao.\nFrom \"Within the realm, there are four greats\" onward,\nall is wondrous and sublime.\nPeople know only that within the realm there are four greats,\nyet do not realize that this very self is even greater.\n\n*Verse:*\nThough Heaven and Earth are great,\nThey too decay and crumble.\nOnly this one thing\nEndures through kalpas unchanged.\nThe sacred, unknowable one—\nall abides in thusness, unmoving.\n\n\"Heaviness is the root of lightness,\nLightness is born of heaviness.\"\n\"Stillness is the ruler of restlessness\"—\nstillness governs movement.\nThus the noble one, though traveling all day,\ndoes not part from the baggage train—\ndares not act lightly.\nThough there be splendid sights,\nhe dwells in serene detachment—\nconstantly responsive, constantly still.\nHow can the lord of ten thousand chariots\ntreat his person lightly in the world?\nTo bear the burden lightly.\nLightness loses ministers,\nImpetuousness loses the ruler.\nSeeking glory brings disgrace.\n\nChapter Twenty-Six\nHeaviness must not be treated lightly.\n\"Lightness loses ministers,\nImpetuousness loses the ruler\"—\nthis is what is meant by \"one who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm,\none who strides cannot walk,\"\nand is also a metaphor for \"whirlwinds and sudden rains.\"\n\"Not parting from the baggage train\" means\nbearing the burden and carrying the load.\n\"Dwelling in serene detachment\" means\nturning things around.\nThis clarifies the preceding chapter’s discourse on modeling oneself on the Dao,\nsummarizes the two chapters on embodying the Dao,\nand continues with the essential teaching of good conduct in the following chapter.\n\n*Verse:*\nImpetuous advance cannot endure,\nLightness cannot accomplish anything.\n\nOne whose heels never touch the ground\nstill treads the journey’s path.\nThe perfect traveler leaves no wheel tracks—\ntracks form where heels press down.\nThe perfect speaker finds no fault in words—\nwords take shape where the tongue begins.\nThe perfect planner needs no counting rods—\none insight melts ten thousand things.\nThe perfect closure needs no bolt nor bar,\nyet cannot be opened—\nno seam or crack remains.\nThe perfect knot needs no cord nor tie,\nyet cannot be undone—\nno binding or constraint is left.\n\nThus the sage is ever skilled at saving others,\nand so no one is cast aside—\ncultivating the self to bring peace to the people.\nEver skilled at saving things,\nand so nothing is cast aside—\nadapting to the moment to benefit all.\nThis is called inheriting clarity—\nclarity unbroken, continuous.\n\nTherefore the good person\nis the teacher of the ungood—\nteaching others to be good.\nThe ungood person\nis the resource of the good—\nwarning others to turn toward goodness.\nIf one does not value one’s teacher,\nthere is no goodness to be had.\nIf one does not cherish one’s resource,\nthere is no fault to be amended.\nThough wise, this is great delusion—\ncasting aside wisdom like foolishness.\nThis is called the essential subtlety—\nacting in accord with nature’s flow.\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven: Exhausting the Essence of the Preceding Chapters\n\nIn speech and action, be meticulous—then no trace remains, no blame accrues. The mind’s calculations cannot be reckoned; the mind’s closures cannot be opened; the mind’s knots cannot be untied. When the mind of Dao stands firm like this, there is no division between good and ungood. Teacher and resource are both forgotten; wisdom is set aside, and one remains all day like a fool.\n\n**Verse:**\nSteps need not depend on feet—\na skillful knot requires no thousand hands.\nTouch the tip of your nose,\nand the whole body becomes a mouth.\nIf you can thoroughly ponder this,\nthe forty-nine arise from the seven-sevens.\n\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine—\ndo not exalt yourself.\nBecome the world’s stream,\nwhere all tributaries return to the source.\nBecome the world’s stream,\nand constant virtue never departs,\nforged into one unbroken whole—\nreturning to the state of an infant,\nwhere qi is complete.\n\nKnow the bright, yet guard the dark—\ndo not display yourself.\nBecome the world’s model,\nwhere all dharmas return to the One.\nBecome the world’s model,\nand constant virtue never errs,\nits standard unwavering—\nreturning to the boundless,\nwhere spirit is complete.\n\nKnow glory, yet guard disgrace—\ndo not prize yourself.\nBecome the world’s valley,\nwhere all existence returns to emptiness.\nBecome the world’s valley,\nand constant virtue is fulfilled,\nprofound and perfectly round—\nreturning to the uncarved block.\n*(Pronounced \"pǔ.\")*\nWhere nature is complete.\nWhen the uncarved block scatters, it becomes vessels,\napplied to things.\nThe sage employs it\nto establish officials and teach the people—\nthus the great system remains uncut,\na teaching without words.\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight: Guarding the Feminine, the Dark, and Disgrace\n\nNot seeing one’s own clarity connects to the preceding chapter’s \"though wise, this is great delusion.\" The infant, the Great Ultimate, the uncarved block—these are the great roots of the world. Only by guarding the feminine and embracing the One can one return to the source. Govern a state with this, and without need for restraint, the people naturally become pure, and things naturally return to simplicity.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithin white, the black is preserved;\nwithin the masculine, the One Feminine is embraced.\nUnbroken, the work continues—\neven men can learn to nurture the infant.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it are mistaken.\nI see they cannot but fail.\nTo wield power against bandits is fitting;\nto become a bandit is not.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nWhere action stirs, misfortune arises.\nThose who act destroy it,\ngrasping what is not theirs, clinging to what is.\nThose who seize lose it,\nseeking advantage, only to fall into it.\nAll things bear form—\nsome lead, some follow;\nsome warm, some chill;\nsome strengthen, some weaken;\nsome uphold, some cast down.\nWhere this exists, that arises—\nbeware of following it.\n\nThus the sage eliminates extremes,\n*(Pronounced \"qù.\")*\nnon-action.\nEliminates excess,\nnon-desire.\nEliminates extravagance,\nnon-attachment.\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine: Non-Action and the Perils of Force\n\nNon-action means no trouble; action invites trouble. Those who seize lose; those who act fail—this is the warning against force. Strength and weakness, upholding and casting down, depend on one another like shadow following form. Where there is success, there is failure. Thus the sage eliminates greed, excess, and arrogance, deeply warning later generations.\n\n**Verse:**\nLeading and following, warming and chilling,\nstrengthening and weakening, upholding and casting down—\nwho is the master in their midst?\nIt is no one.\nDressing and eating are ordinary matters—\nwhy trouble yourself with needless doubt?\n\nThose who assist a ruler with the Dao do so through non-action.\nDo not seek to strengthen the world with arms,\nbut defend it with compassion.\nSuch deeds swiftly return—\n*(Pronounced \"xuán.\")*\ngood and evil alike bear fruit.\nWhere armies encamp,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nWhere the mind’s troops arise,\nthe sacred ground lies barren.\nAfter great armies pass,\nyears of famine follow.\nWhere demonic forces gallop,\nessence and qi are depleted.\n\nThus the good accomplish their ends and stop—\n*(Pronounced \"yǐ.\")*\nwhere there is decisiveness, life arises.\nThey dare not seize strength,\nbut meet force with softness.\nAccomplishing without boasting—\neliminating extremes.\nAccomplishing without flaunting—\neliminating excess.\nAccomplishing without arrogance—\neliminating extravagance.\nAccomplishing only when unavoidable—\neven in hardship, this is the way.\nThus they accomplish without forcing—\nlowering the banner of the sword.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age;\nwhen arms grow strong, they do not prevail.\nThis is called \"not-Dao\"—\na mistake.\nThose who depart from the Dao perish early,\nforever losing the true Way.\n\nChapter Thirty: Assisting Rulers with the Dao\n\nContinuing the preceding chapter’s elimination of excess and extravagance: those who assist rulers with the Dao do not exalt military might. Good and evil alike bear fruit—this warns those who govern states and families to guard the feminine, embrace the One, and be brave in their restraint. Even when unavoidable, they dare not seize strength, thus it is said: \"The good accomplish their ends and stop.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nDo not let the three minds run wild—\nlet the will always lead the intent.\nSuddenly, if forced into battle,\none arrow settles Mount Tian.\n\nFine weapons are inauspicious tools.\nAfter great armies pass, years of famine follow.\nSome may detest them—\n*(Pronounced \"wù.\")*\nwhere armies encamp, thorns and brambles grow.\nThus those who embody the Dao do not dwell there.\n*(Pronounced \"chǔ.\")*\nWhere the mind’s troops do not arise.\n\nThe noble person at rest values the left,\nembracing softness.\nIn war, they value the right,\nembracing hardness.\nWeapons are inauspicious tools,\nused to suppress rebellion—\nnot the tools of the noble person,\nwho constantly governs.\nOnly when unavoidable are they used,\nwith tranquility as the highest aim,\ndefending with compassion.\nVictory is not glorified—\nto do so is to seek merit.\nThis is delighting in killing.\n*(Pronounced \"yuè.\")*\nIndulging in hardness and bravery.\nThose who delight in killing\nplant the seeds of misfortune—\nthey cannot prevail in the world,\nfor the Creator does not tolerate them.\n\nAuspicious affairs value the left,\nembracing life.\nInauspicious affairs value the right,\nembracing death.\nThe deputy general stands on the left,\nvaluing softness.\nThe supreme general stands on the right,\nvaluing hardness.\nThis is to handle them with mourning rites—\ninauspicious tools.\nWhen many are killed,\nit is unavoidable—\nmourn them with sorrow and tears.\n*(One says: compassion.)*\nWhen victorious in battle,\nhandle it with mourning rites,\nas if grieving for parents.\n\nChapter Thirty-One: Weapons as Inauspicious Tools\n\nNot seeking to strengthen the world with arms, the text follows with \"weapons are inauspicious tools,\" deeply warning the sage about this.\n\nBeneath the myriad generations, lords of states who embrace non-action and purity bring about governance and transformation naturally, so that households and nations alike attain tranquility. Though they possess armor and weapons, they have no occasion to deploy them, forever free from the calamity of strife and contention.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nSilent, the realm of pure mystery,\nLimpid, nurturing the Great Harmony.\nInverted, the sword of samādhi is grasped,\nSequentially, the five skandha-demons are transformed.\n\nThe Dao is ever nameless, empty and self-so.\nThough the Unhewn is minute to the point of imperceptibility,\nnone under Heaven dare make it a subject.\nSupreme it is.\nShould lords and kings be able to preserve it,\nembracing the One,\nthe myriad things will of themselves become guests,\nnone failing to submit.\n\nHeaven and Earth unite,\naided only by virtue,\nto send down sweet dew—\nthe result of harmonious qi.\nThe people, without command, of themselves attain balance.\n*(Command: read in the departing tone.)*\nNaturally they achieve peace.\nWhen first systems are established, names arise,\nlaws and institutions are set forth.\nOnce names exist,\nlikes and dislikes are shown.\nThus they will know where to halt.\n*(This is to make them know prohibitions.)*\nKnowing where to halt is how one avoids peril.\nKnowing contentment is how one abides in constant joy.\nThe Dao’s presence in the world\ncomes to rest in utmost goodness,\nas streams and valleys\ncome to rest in rivers and seas—\nin lowliness.\n\nChapter Thirty-Two:\nThe preceding chapter states that “those with the Dao do not dwell [in contention],” and here it says, “The Dao is ever nameless; though the Unhewn is small, none under Heaven dare make it a subject.” This clarifies the essential dwelling of those with the Dao. The person of the Dao outwardly abides beneath the chariot, inwardly embraces the One Real, and the myriad things naturally transform. Heavenly principle is spontaneously so, merging with spiritual transformation—boundless.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nOnce you grasp the Unhewn without flaw,\nyou can freely release and gather.\nThen the great chiliocosm\nis held in the tip of a hair.\n\nKnowing others is wisdom,\nmanifest outwardly.\nKnowing oneself is clarity,\nmanifest inwardly.\nOvercoming others requires strength,\ncourage in daring.\nOvercoming oneself requires strength,\ncourage in not daring.\nKnowing contentment is wealth—\neven in poverty, one is joyful.\nThose who persevere in action have resolve,\never unassailable.\nThose who do not lose their grasp endure,\ntheir will and power grow ever firmer,\ntheir life’s foundation ever more secure.\nThose who “die yet do not perish” attain longevity.\n*(Longevity: read in the rising tone.)*\nThe True One abides constantly.\n\nChapter Thirty-Three:\nKnowing others and overcoming others pertain to the external.\nKnowing oneself and overcoming oneself reside within.\nThis confirms the warning of the preceding three chapters against the use of arms.\nThose who know contentment find joy even in poverty.\nThose who persevere in action see all things accomplished.\nThose who firmly hold their ground face no peril.\nThose inwardly illuminated transcend life and death.\n“Dying yet not perishing” means the True One abides constantly.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nSeeing things yet not seeing nature,\nknowing others yet not knowing oneself—\nsuch unlearned sorts\nstill claim to have gained advantage.\n\nThe Great Dao overflows,\nvast and all-encompassing.\nIt can be to the left or right,\nwithout limit.\nThe myriad things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;\nwhere it passes, transformation occurs.\nIts work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession—\nwhat remains is spirit.\nIt nurtures and sustains the myriad things yet does not act as their lord,\nforgetting its own origin.\nEver desireless, still and unmoving,\nit may be called “small.”\n*(A mustard seed contains Mount Sumeru.)*\nThe myriad things return to it, yet it does not act as their lord,\nletting things follow their natural course.\nIt may be called “great.”\n*(Mount Sumeru contains a mustard seed.)*\nThus the sage never regards himself as great,\n*(Abiding within a mustard seed.)*\nand so is able to accomplish greatness—\nbeyond measure.\n\nChapter Thirty-Four:\n“The Great Dao overflows” means it is utterly vast, penetrating the most subtle, lacking nothing. “The myriad things rely on it to live yet it does not refuse” and what follows connect to the preceding chapter’s “those who do not lose their grasp endure.” Applied to governing the state, this means not losing one’s grasp; applied to self-cultivation, it means “dying yet not perishing.” Hence it is said, “It can be to the left or right.”\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Great Dao is truly hard to fathom,\nempty space cannot be measured.\nVast and boundless, forming a single expanse—\nwhere are its borders?\n\nGrasping the Great Image,\n*(Image: read in the rising tone.)*\nthough one looks, it cannot be seen—\nall under Heaven come to it.\n\nThe myriad people submit.\nThey come without harm, and the myriad things flourish.\nIn peace and great tranquility,\nthe ten thousand transformations rest secure.\n\nMusic and delicacies—\n*(Music: read as \"yào.\")*\nboth sound and flavor are exquisite.\nThey entice the passing traveler to stay.\nYet when the traveler passes, they cease.\n\nThe Dao that issues from the mouth\nis bland, as if without flavor.\n*(Issues: read in the falling tone.)*\nWithout sound, without scent,\ngazing, one cannot see it—\nthe Great Image has no form.\nListening, one cannot hear it—\nthe Great Tone is soundless.\nIts use cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe Dao is hidden, without name;\nits use is inexhaustible.\n\nChapter Thirty-Five:\nThe closing line of the preceding chapter states, \"Hence it can accomplish greatness,\" so this chapter follows with \"Grasping the Great Image, all under Heaven come,\" meaning that preserving its formlessness draws the hearts of people and things to turn and submit. \"Music and delicacies,\" where both sound and flavor are exquisite, lose this formlessness—how can they endure? The Dao that issues from the mouth is flavorless and formless, without sound or color. Because it has no fixed body, its responsiveness and use are inexhaustible.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nA mud ox pants at the moon,\na wooden horse neighs in the wind.\nGazing, it seems to exist—\nseeking, it has no trace.\nThe hermit’s staff at Clear Hermitage\nsketches the wondrous peak of Miao Gao.\nTo gather it in?\nOne must first firmly open it—\nfirmly opening, it must then gather.\n\nTo weaken it, one must first firmly strengthen it—firmly strengthened, it must then weaken.\nTo abolish it, one must first firmly establish it—firmly established, it must then abolish.\nTo seize it, one must first firmly give it—firmly given, it must then seize.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\nThe slightest sign is the first omen.\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThe soft and weak are ever harmonious; to employ hardness is to court defeat.\nFish cannot leave the depths—\nhow can man depart from the Dao?\nA state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\nWhere there is advantage, there is harm.\n\nThis is the thirty-sixth chapter.\nGrasping the Great Image, one perceives the subtlest signs of affairs.\nNo sooner does one see firm expansion than one knows coming contraction;\nbefore the sprout appears, the omen is already known.\nWho but the subtly illuminated of all under Heaven could attain this?\n\nThose who study the Dao preserve its formlessness and guard its utmost softness.\nThey contend not with things, and thus naturally know the signs.\nIf one employs violence, exalts stratagems and cunning,\nseeking to overcome things—this is not the Dao.\nFor example, fish belong in water;\nto seek distinction among other fish and leave the depths—is this possible?\nSince it is not, then neither should man exalt power.\nTo exalt power is to reverse the constant—like fish leaving the depths, they must perish.\n\nA state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others—\nthis aligns with Confucius’ saying, “One may stand with them, but not weigh with them.”\nEven when sages employ power, reversing the constant to accord with the Dao,\nit must not be lightly done—how much less so for ordinary people?\nCan one not be warned?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nEyes like shooting stars,\nmechanism swift as lightning.\nGazing, it seems ahead—\nsuddenly, it is gone.\nWithin the openness and obstruction of the ten directions,\nlight pervades all without exception.\n\nThe Dao is ever non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\nStill and unmoving, it responds and connects with all under Heaven.\nShould lords and kings be able to guard it,\nthe myriad things will transform of themselves.\nAbove, they transform those below as wind.\nWhen transformation stirs and desires arise,\nI will quell them with the nameless uncarved block.\n\n*Act* (pronounced in the entering tone).\nWithout desire on my part, the people naturally return to simplicity.\nThe nameless uncarved block also will have no desire.\nI value stillness, and the people naturally rectify themselves.\nWithout desire, through stillness,\nthe wise are made not to dare act.\nAll under Heaven will naturally rectify itself.\n\nAct through non-action—\nthen nothing will be left ungoverned.\n\nThis is the thirty-seventh chapter.\nThe true and constant Dao is fundamentally non-action;\naction is not the constant Dao.\nThis connects to the previous chapter’s subtle illumination.\nHeaven and Earth act not, yet the myriad things are born and completed.\nThe sage acts not, yet the myriad people are at peace.\nIn terms of self-cultivation:\nwithout any contrivance, in moments of stillness preserve its formlessness.\nAt the slightest movement, one must first awaken—\nonce awakened, quell it with the nameless uncarved block.\nThe uncarved block has no form, and is also called nameless—meaning emptiness.\nThe Dao is non-action; the uncarved block is nameless; the heart is without desire—\nthen one naturally returns to stillness.\nStillness upon stillness—\nall under Heaven will naturally rectify itself.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nAll action is illusion;\nnon-action, too, falls into emptiness.\nTranscending both paths,\none unfolds the essence of the lineage.\n\nThe *Daoist Gatherings of the Meeting of Dao and Virtue*, Volume One, concludes here. #1 (This passage appears doubtful.)\nThe *Daoist Gatherings of the Meeting of Dao and Virtue*, Volume Two.\nRecorded by Li Daochun Yuan-su of Clear Hermitage in Du Liang, the Firefly-toad Daoist.\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—\nthus its virtue is all the greater.\n\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—\nthus it clings to its own virtue.\nTherefore, it has no virtue,\nand its virtue is ever more lost.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without acting and without contrivance,\nstill and unmoving,\nyet responsive and perfectly attuned.\nThe lesser virtue acts with contrivance,\nseeking resonance through virtue,\never scheming and striving.\n\nThe highest benevolence acts without contrivance,\nbestowing kindness upon all things,\nyet fundamentally without action.\nThe highest righteousness acts with contrivance,\nengaging with things through righteousness,\never scheming and striving.\nThe highest propriety acts, yet none respond—\nseeking to order all things through ritual,\nyet never truly ordering them.\nOne thrusts forth an arm to pull them back,\nbut the more one pulls, the less they align.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises—close to the Dao.\nWhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises—close to virtue.\nWhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises—close to benevolence.\nWhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises—close to righteousness.\nYet propriety marks the thinning of sincerity,\nthe erosion of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\nIt fails to order.\nForeknowledge is but the flower of the Dao,\nseeking novelty without substance—\nthe beginning of folly,\nthe loss of the Dao.\n\nTherefore, the great person dwells in depth, not in shallowness,\nvalues substance and truth, not recognition.\nAbides in reality, not in its blossoms,\nupholds sincerity, not propriety.\nThus, one discards that and embraces this—\nforsakes delusion to follow truth.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nThe preceding chapter spoke of the Dao’s constant non-action,\nso this follows with the highest virtue’s non-virtue.\nThe highest virtue acts without acting, thus aligning with the Dao.\nThe lesser virtue acts with contrivance, thus misaligning with the Dao.\nBenevolence and righteousness remain close to virtue,\nserving as steps toward the Dao.\nPropriety, however, is rife with contrivance and lacks substance—\nseeking to order all things through ritual,\nyet things grow ever more disordered.\nFor all contrivance ultimately leads to loss.\nEven clinging without loss may gradually lead to refinement,\nreturning from benevolence and righteousness to virtue,\nfrom virtue to the Dao,\nand thus attaining non-action.\n\nForeknowledge is but cleverness,\nand cleverness marks the beginning of the Dao’s loss.\nThus it is called the flower of the Dao—\nthose who possess the Dao do not dwell in it.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nBefore transcending the Three Realms,\nhow can one escape the Five Constants?\nThe Five Constants dissolve into formlessness,\nas one strides alone to meet the August Void.\n\nOf old, those who attained the One—\nattaining the One, all things were complete.\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nprofoundly still and constant.\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nsilent and unmoving.\nSpirits attained the One and became numinous,\nmerging into truth.\nValleys attained the One and became full,\nabundant and overflowing.\nThe myriad things attained the One and came to life,\nnaturally flourishing.\nLords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under Heaven,\nserene and firmly established.\nTheir attainment was the One.\n\nIf Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear splitting—\nthe stars and constellations would lose their order.\nIf Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear erupting—\nmountains and peaks would crumble.\nIf spirits lacked numinosity, they would fear fading—\nyin and yang would lose their harmony.\nIf valleys lacked fullness, they would fear exhaustion—\nblocked and impassable.\nIf the myriad things lacked life, they would fear extinction—\nthe harmonious qi would dissipate.\nIf lords and kings lacked integrity, their loftiness and nobility would fear collapse—\ntheir states and families would face peril.\n\nThus, nobility takes humility as its root—this is the One.\nLoftiness takes lowliness as its foundation—this is the One.\nLords and kings call themselves \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute,\"\never embracing the One.\nIs this not taking humility as their root?\nThe One is the master of the ten thousand images—\nis it not so?\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nThus, when counting carts, there is no single cart—*shu*, pronounced *suo*.\nWhen counting *wo*, there is no *wo*.\nOne does not wish to be as polished as jade, or as cold as stone.\nNoble and base are both forgotten.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nThe previous chapter spoke of discarding that to take this—meaning to discard the superficial and take the root.\nWhat is the root? The One.\nThe One is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the mother of the myriad things, the application of the Great Dao.\nIf lords and kings could guard it, the myriad things would naturally return to it.\nCalling oneself \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"destitute\" is to remain humble and not forget the root.\nNot wishing to be as polished as jade or as cold as stone, forgetting noble and base—only embracing the One.\nThe name \"counting carts\" has no single cart.\nThe name \"counting *wo*\" has no single *wo*.\nWhen the axle and wheels unite, it is called a cart.\nWhen the four elements unite, it is called *wo*.\n\nThe ode says:\nObtaining the One is not called wondrous,\nReturning to emptiness is not yet the Mysterious.\nKnowing a dream is a dream within dreaming,\nBeyond Heaven, do not seek Heaven.\n\nThe reversal is the movement of the Dao—\nWhen the numinous One emerges, it is drawn back.\nThe weak is the application of the Dao.\nFocused *qi* achieves softness.\n\nThe myriad things arise from *you* (having).\n*You* has a name—it is the mother of the myriad things.\n*You* arises from *wu* (non-being).\n*Wu* has no name—it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nThe reversal is the movement of the Dao—continuing the previous chapter’s teaching that nobility takes humility as its root.\nThe myriad things arise from *you*, *you* from *wu*—this is the teaching of counting carts without a cart.\nYet how many scholars do not grasp this principle truly.\n\nMoreover, how does the Dao express the essence of *you* and *wu*?\nObserve the ode:\nHaving form is not *you*,\nFormless is not *wu*.\nNeither *you* nor *wu* can stand alone—\nStill, this is to fall into one-sidedness.\nOnly within the interplay of *you* and *wu* does one find the path—\nThen one knows the Master’s hidden beard.\n\nThe superior person hears the Dao and diligently acts upon it;\nThe superior person resolves and unifies it all at once.\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe middle scholar hears the Dao—sometimes as if it exists, sometimes as if it does not.\nThe mediocre and below hear much but believe little.\nThe lowly scholar hears the Dao and laughs at it.\nWhy do they not believe? Only because it is too clear.\nIf one does not laugh, it is not truly the Dao.\nAfter great confusion, there must be great awakening.\n\nThus it is said:\nAt first hearing, the two fragments reveal the liver’s depths.\nThe Dao, though bright, is veiled in bloom—\nAdvancing in the Dao seems like retreat,\nLooking forward and backward.\nThe Dao blends like harmony, like dust in the light.\nVirtue’s height is like a valley—\nEmpty, it receives all.\nGreat whiteness seems like shame—\nLowly, it tends itself.\nBroad virtue seems insufficient—\nFull yet not overflowing.\nEstablished virtue seems like theft—\n*Thief*, pronounced *yú*, rhymes with *yú* (渝).\nSealed yet not exposed.\nTrue substance, like *yú*, adapts without measure.\nThe greatest square has no corners—\nNo sharp angles revealed.\nGreat vessels mature late—\nNo claim to their own achievement.\nGreat sound is rare—\nStrike it, and it responds.\nGreat form is shapeless.\nNothing is more hidden than what is concealed.\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless—\nNothing is more manifest than the subtle.\n\nOnly the Dao\nLends itself well and brings completion.\nLoyalty and reciprocity—nothing more.\n\n---\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of *you* and *wu* generating each other—\nA teaching only the noble can doubt.\nThus, it follows with the superior scholar hearing the Dao.\nThe Dao, though veiled, though seeming retreat, though blending, though hidden like theft,\nCannot be seen—\nHence the reason for laughter upon hearing it.\nOnly the noble, with nature pure and empty,\nCan transcend and enter directly—\nSilent yet believed, effortless yet accomplished.\n\nThe mediocre and below cannot help but waver between doubt and belief;\nThe lowly and unworthy do not merely disbelieve—they laugh and scorn it.\n\n*\"Lends itself well and brings completion\"* means:\nLending to the lowly’s laughter and scorn,\nWhile completing the superior’s diligent practice.\n\nEven the lowly and unworthy—\nOnce awakened at the start,\nCan turn back to goodness.\nWhy should anyone be abandoned for their failings?\n\nThe ode says:\nThe supreme Dao is originally easy,\nYet human hearts claim it difficult.\nThe middle scholar still debates,\nThe lowly turns dull-witted.\nNo dull-witted star exists—\nWeigh it, and the thing is on the scale.\n\nThe Dao generates One—\nThe void generates One *qi*.\nOne generates Two—\nOne *qi* divides into yin and yang.\nTwo generates Three—\nYin forms the Three Powers.\nThree generates the myriad things.\nThe Three Powers generate myriad forms.\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nTaking form from Heaven, shape from Earth.\nThe harmonizing *qi* is the middle.\nExamine the *qi* of middle harmony.\n\nWhat people detest—\nThe solitary, the orphaned, the unpaired,\nThe cornerless—\nIs what rulers prize.\nThey call themselves solitary and orphaned.\nThus, all things have form.\nSometimes, diminishing benefits,\nThe humble receive gain.\nSometimes, adding causes loss—\nThe full must overturn.\nWhat people teach is always for goodness—\nYet it is also my righteous teaching.\nI am also like this.\n\nThe mighty and overbearing shall not meet their end.\nThe strong and powerful are doomed to perish.\nI shall take this as my guiding principle.\n\nThe unvirtuous become the foundation for the virtuous.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Two:**\nOne is the mother of all things.\nWhat people detest—this One without pair,\nThe solitary, the orphaned, the unpaired—\nThe great lords and nobles do not forget their roots,\nAnd thus call themselves solitary and orphaned,\nIn humility and self-effacement.\n\nThose who are humble and self-effacing shall surely receive benefit,\nWhile the strong and powerful shall surely invite calamity.\n\nThe Sage establishes this teaching,\nTo warn people to restrain themselves and practice humility,\nTo see what is unvirtuous and inwardly reflect upon it.\n\n**Ode:**\nTo love victory is to often meet adversity,\nTo practice humility is to long endure peace.\nGentleness and harmony are daily virtues,\nIn every place, the realm of kings and mountains.\n\nThe utmost softness in the world\nOvercomes the utmost hardness in the world.\nSoftness can erode hardness.\nThere is nothing that cannot enter where there are no gaps.\nPiercing metal, penetrating stone.\n\nThus, I know the benefit of *wuwei*.\nHumility brings benefit.\nTeaching without words,\nSilent yet trusted.\nThe benefit of *wuwei* is achieved through *wuwei*.\nFew in the world can attain this.\nThose who understand harmony are rare.\n\n**Chapter 43:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of the lonely and widowed who do not turn their wheels [of action], the utmost humility. Hence, it follows with the utmost softness.\nIt means that softness overcomes hardness, that loss contains benefit, and that loss upon loss reaches *wuwei* [non-action].\nWithout speaking, yet trustworthy; the benefit of *wuwei*, few in the world attain.\n**Ode:**\nWhen met with opposition, do not compete,\nWhen matters pass, let the heart remain cool.\nThis very realm of coolness,\nWhere even the heavens and earth cannot conceal it.\nWhich is closer—name or body?\nA high name brings dishonor to the body.\nWhich is more abundant—body or wealth?\nExcess wealth brings harm to oneself.\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\nGained favor invites dishonor.\nThus, the more one loves, the greater the expense,\nThe more one covets others’ possessions, the more one clings to them.\nThe more one hoards, the greater the loss.\nSeeking advantage only brings misfortune.\nKnowing sufficiency brings no dishonor; sufficiency stops greed.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril; fearing restraint averts calamity.\nThus, one may endure long.\nKnowing sufficiency is always sufficiency.\n\n**Chapter 44:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of the benefit of *wuwei*, meaning that action brings loss.\nHence, it follows with: *Which is closer—name or body?*\nName, wealth, gain, and loss are all rooted in action; they cannot endure long.\nOnly knowing sufficiency and restraint can endure long.\n**Ode:**\nAll things in the world are transient,\nNone can last eternally.\nTame the restless monkey-mind,\nListen to the lion’s roar.\nIf one can unleash the treasure within the family,\nThen the spring blooms like birdsong in mountain flowers.\nThe greatest attainment seems incomplete,\nYet its use knows no exhaustion. (*弊* rhymes with *鳖*)\nNot self-displaying, hence unbroken.\nThe greatest abundance seems to overflow,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nNot self-satisfied, hence without end.\nThe greatest uprightness seems to bend,\nYet it does not flaunt.\nThe greatest skill seems clumsy,\nYet it does not rely on artifice.\nThe greatest discernment seems inarticulate,\nYet it shines without glare.\nAgitation overcomes coldness—\nThe reckless burn.\nCalm overcomes heat—\nThe tranquil cool.\nPurity and stillness are the Dao of the world.\nIf people can abide in purity and stillness,\nAll under heaven will return to them.\n\n**Chapter 45:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of purity and stillness as the Dao of the world, so it follows with: *The greatest attainment seems incomplete...*\nThose with virtue in excess yet action in deficit live long,\nThose with wealth in excess yet action in deficit are despised.\nThe greatest attainment seems incomplete,\nThe greatest abundance seems to overflow,\nEven to the utmost bending, clumsiness, and inarticulateness—\nAll are virtue in excess yet action in deficit,\nTheir use is inexhaustible.\nThus, they are the Dao of the world.\n**Ode:**\nHuman nature knows gathering and scattering,\nThe world’s ways have rise and decline.\nOnly the True Constant endures,\nUnchanged from ancient to modern.\nTo transform the world there is a method:\nEmotions follow nature.\nTo curb the warhorses with dung,\nThe mind-horse is idle, the spirit-sprout flourishes.\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nNature follows emotions.\nWarhorses are born in the suburbs.\nThe mind-horse rages, the heart’s ground is desolate.\nNo guilt is greater than craving,\nThe root of dishonor.\nNo calamity is greater than not knowing sufficiency,\nThe trap that ensnares the body.\nNo blame is greater than desiring gain,\nThe origin of self-destruction.\nThus, knowing sufficiency is always sufficiency.\nThe contented poor find joy in their lot.\n\n**Chapter 46:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of purity and stillness as the Dao of the world, so it follows with: *The world’s ways have rise and decline...*\nNot stepping outside yet knowing the world—\nThis speaks of the Daoist who knows the inner yet ignores the outer, continuing the previous chapter’s meaning.\nTo know the inner yet ignore the outer\nIs to know nothing yet see nothing.\nIf one only knows the outer and sees the outer while forgetting the inner,\nThen one’s knowledge and vision are shallow and narrow.\n**Ode:**\nMorning I wander the Southern Peak,\nEvening I rest in the Azure Mound.\nSwiftly a thousand miles,\nYet never have I strayed from it.\nTread iron shoes to no avail—\nThe sought is found without effort.\nTo study is to daily increase,\nTo practice the Dao is to daily decrease.\nDecrease upon decrease,\nAll loss is exhausted.\nUntil reaching *wuwei* [non-action],\nWhere nothing more can be lost.\nIn *wuwei*, yet nothing is undone.\nNothing is unconquered.\nTo take the world, one must act with no affairs,\nFor affairs arise from the mind’s fixation.\nWhen affairs arise, the mind’s fixation cannot be attained.\nThus, it is insufficient to take the world.\nAction always has an end.\n\n**Chapter 47:**\nNot stepping outside yet knowing the world—\nThis is inner knowledge.\nThe farther one goes, the more distant,\nOuter affairs.\nHence, it follows with: *To study is to daily increase...*\nIt means the unlearned seek only gain,\nBut those who practice the Dao decrease in all things.\nThe *Yijing* says: *Mountains below, marshes above—loss. The superior person restrains anger and checks desires.*\nThis is exactly so.\nWhen even anger is extinguished and desire is lost,\nUntil reaching *wuwei* [non-action],\nThen all under heaven is transformed and the world returns to order.\nIf one acts recklessly,\nThe people are disordered and difficult to govern.\nThus, it is insufficient to take the world.\n\n**Chapter 49:**\nThe ode says:\n*With learning, confusion grows at every turn,*\n*Without action, all things fall into place.*\n*When both learning and action are abandoned,*\n*Loss and gain are left to others.*\n\nDo not mock my humble, poverty-stricken appearance,\nFor from old it is said that thieves do not rob the poor.\n\nThe sage has no fixed mind,\nNo rigid method of action.\nHe takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nHe follows the Way’s spontaneous responses,\nAdjusting to circumstances.\n\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous;\nI follow them and do virtuous deeds.\nTo the unvirtuous, I am also virtuous;\nI guide them to return to virtue.\n*Virtue’s power is complete*—\nIt fulfills their highest good.\n\nTo the faithful, I am faithful;\nI follow them and do faithful deeds.\nTo the unfaithful, I am also faithful;\nI guide them to return to faith.\n*Faith’s power is complete*—\nIt fulfills their highest truth.\n\nThe sage moves through the world in reverence—\n*惵惵* (*jùn-jùn*), trembling with care,\n*兢兢业业* (*jìng-jìng yèyè*), diligent and unwavering—\nYet he blends the hearts of the people,\n*浑* (*hún*), leveling them as one.\nDifferent paths, the same end.\nAll the people turn their ears and eyes toward him;\nHis bearing is dignified, his deeds a model.\nThe sage nurtures them as children.\nUnder heaven, one great family.\n\nThe preceding chapter spoke of *wuwei* [non-action] taking the world,\nSo it follows with: *The sage has no fixed mind.*\nBy *no fixed mind*, it means\nFollowing the Way’s spontaneous responses,\nNever opposing the natural inclinations of the people.\nThus, the people obey the sage’s words,\nEmulate the sage’s actions,\nFollow the sage’s transformation,\nAnd the world unites in one heart.\n\nThe ode says:\n*To the faithful, I follow their faith,*\n*To the virtuous, I follow their virtue.*\nIf one could truly understand this,\nYet still cling to inverted views—\n*颠倒见* (*diāndào jiàn*, inverted perception)—\nThen the Three Realms become one expanse,\nAnd the ten directions merge into a single plane.\nEmerging from birth, entering death,\nPassing through the gates of anger and desire.\n\nThose who live abandon anger and desire,\nYet thirteen in ten perish by water or fire.\nThose who die indulge in anger and desire,\nYet thirteen in ten are spared by water or fire.\nAll life depends on water and fire.\nTo stir them toward death’s path,\nWater and fire clash against them—\nAlso thirteen in ten.\n*Water* completes its cycle in six,\n*Fire* in seven.\nWhy so?\nIt is anger and desire that cause this.\n\n「With its profound nurturing of life,\nAnger and desire do not cease,\nGreed for life is insatiable.\nIt is said that those who skillfully guard life\nHave no anger or desire.\n\nTraveling by land, they meet no tigers or rhinoceroses—\n*兕* (*rì*, rhinoceros).\nIn self-reflection, they feel no guilt,\nSo what need for worry or fear?\nEntering battle, they are not harmed by armor or weapons,\nTheir hearts unobstructed, so no dread exists.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nThe tiger no place to set its claws,\nWeapons no place to hold their blades.\nIf one does not cling to life,\nHow could there be death?\nWhy so?\nThe body is not mine to possess,\nDeath cannot harm me—\nFor I dwell in the realm of no-death.\n\nForgetting birth and death,\nThus the right fifty-first chapter:\nThe gentle and weak are those who guard life,\nThe strong and mighty are those who perish.\nThe gentle and weak can curb anger and desire,\nWhile the strong and mighty are enslaved by them.\nTo curb anger, fire descends and is extinguished,\nTo restrain desire, water rises and is contained.\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, life is sustained—\nHence they are called *those who guard life*.\nAnger stirs the fire of ignorance,\nDesire churns like ocean waves,\nWhen water and fire clash, death ensues—\nHence they are called *those who perish*.\nThe strong and mighty greed for life without limit,\nThe gentle and weak regard death as returning home,\nFor they do not see death as death,\nSo what harm can tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, or weapons do to them?\n\nIn terms of the *Dan Dao* (Alchemical Dao),\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, the *saintly embryo* (聖胎) congeals.\nThe ode says:\n*Nirvana* (涅盘) is easy to grasp in the heart,\nBut discriminative wisdom is hard to discern.\nWithout discriminative wisdom,\nHow could there be death or life?\nThe *Dao* gives birth,\nThe *Yuan Shi* (元始) is the primal *qi* (祖气).\nThe *virtue/power* (德) nurtures it—\n*Nurture* (畜), pronounced *xiù* (凶入声).\nIt transforms and gives birth to all the *Realms of Existence* (诸天).\nIt shapes all things—\nIn the heavens, it forms *images* (象).\nBy *effort* (势), it shapes forms on earth.\nThus all things, with their myriad forms,\nDo not fail to honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.\nAll arise from the Dao,\nThe Dao’s grandeur, virtue’s nobility—\nExceeding the ancients, surpassing the present.\n\nNone know their rank yet remain ever natural,\nThey do not speak of goodness in response.\nThus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, and preserves—\n*Qi* (神) is complete.\nIt grows and fosters—\n*Qi* (气) is complete.\nIt matures and perfects—\n*Essence* (精) is complete.\nIt nourishes and shelters—\nForm is complete.\nLife is given yet not possessed,\nForgetting the *mechanisms* (机).\nAction is taken yet not relied upon,\nForgetting the *affections* (情).\nIt grows yet is never slaughtered,\nForgetting all things—\nThis is called *mysterious virtue/power* (玄德),\nIn harmony with the Dao.\n\nThus the right fifty-first chapter:\nThose who skillfully guard life\nKnow the realm of no-death,\nHence they follow with the words of *Dao-giving-birth*.\nThe Dao is formless,\nYet through giving birth to the heavens and earth, its form becomes visible.\nThe Dao is nameless,\nYet through fostering all things, its name can be established.\nAll things with their forms\nReceive their mandate from the heavens,\nTake shape from the earth,\nDraw *qi* from the *Central Harmony* (中和),\nAll are the Dao’s manifestations—\nThus all things honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.\n\nThe ode says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao*,\n*The Way of non-action yet has action*.\nI clearly explain it for you,\nYet all waters flow westward.\nThe night arrives, and the *chaos* (混沌) is plucked from the earth,\nAll forms and patterns remain unknown.\nThe world has a beginning,\nNameless—\nThe beginning of the heavens and earth.\nThey call it the *mother of the world*.\nWith a name—\nThe *mother of all things*.\nKnowing its mother,\nKnowing the root—\nKnowing its root,\nIts children reveal its end.\nKnowing its children,\nKnowing its future—\nReturning to its mother,\nAttaining the root—\nThe body remains unharmed,\nEver present.\nSeal its *joy* (兑),\nThe inner realm does not escape.\nClose its *gate* (门),\nThe outer realm does not enter.\nA lifetime without exertion—\nNot laboring yet governing.\nOpen its joy,\nThe inner realm emerges,\nAccomplishing its affairs—\nThe outer realm enters.\nA lifetime without salvation—\nForever losing the true Dao.\n\nSeeing the small as *illumination* (明),\nKnowing the subtle and minute (*few* and *microscopic*).\nGuarding gentleness as *strength* (强).\nSoftness can erode hardness.\nUsing its *light* (光),\nAll things come and are illuminated.\nReturning to its illumination, letting go and gathering—\nNo harm befalls the body.\n*Letting go* (遗), pronounced *wèi* (音谓).\nBeware of following others’ paths.\nThis is called *embracing constancy* (袭常).」\n\nThe Way gives birth—\nThis is the origin of the Way’s speech,\nThus it follows the beginning of all things beneath Heaven.\n\nThe final sentence is most urgent—\nThose who cultivate the True Dao must turn here to the True Eye,\nLest they stray past it.\n\nThe ode proclaims:\n*\"Not gathering, not releasing,*\n*The highest is attainable,*\n*Pure and clear by nature,*\n*The original form.\"*\n\nFurther inquiry: How is the First Principle?\nAll speech about the Way is slander.\n\nLet me know—\nBefore action, there is awareness.\nWalk the Great Dao:\nDo nothing,\nYet fear only what is given.\nThose who recognize the Law tremble.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and level,\nSmooth and straight,\nYet people prefer shortcuts.\n*Good*—pronounced *xiào* (去声).\nThey take risks for luck.\n\nWhen affairs are excessive, chaos follows.\n*Chao*—pronounced *cháo* (音潮).\nFields lie barren, sacred lands abandoned.\nGranaries are empty—\nSacred lands exhausted.\nWearing ornate robes—greed.\nWielding sharp blades—anger.\nDisdaining food and drink—delusion.\nWealth in excess—desire never ceases.\nThis is called *robber’s pride*.\n\nThe Three Poisons stir unrest—\nThis is not the Way. Indeed, it is error.\n\nThe **Fifty-Third Chapter** (of the *Right* section) follows the previous chapter’s *\"Climb the Constant\"*—meaning the secret application of the Constant Dao—hence it continues with *\"Let me know before action, there is awareness.\"*\n\nWith awareness, one can directly uphold and secretly apply it; without awareness, one cannot secretly apply it and acts recklessly. The mind is obscured by internal defilements and external karma and perception, compounded by ignorance, while the Three Poisons agitate—this is not the Dao, indeed it is error.\n\nThe verse praises:\n*\"Toying with cleverness ends in clumsiness,*\n*Excessive troubles bring early decay.*\n*Gold and jade fill the hall,*\n*Yet how can they be kept always?*\nIf daily life is reversed in action,\nAll dust and sand of earth become treasure.*\n\n*The well-built does not uproot,*\n*Uproot—pronounced **bá** (音跋).*\n*Roots deep.*\n*The well-embraced does not fall,*\n*Base firm.*\n*Descendants’ sacrifices never cease,*\n*Enduring.*\n\n*Cultivate it in the self—self refined,*\n*Its virtue becomes true;*\n*Fully true.*\n*Cultivate it in the family—family harmonized,*\n*Its virtue overflows;*\n*Abundant.*\n*Cultivate it in the village—village refined,*\n*Its virtue endures;*\n*Long-lasting.*\n*Cultivate it in the realm—realm governed,*\n*Its virtue is profound;*\n*Thick and rich.*\n*Cultivate it in the world—world at peace,*\n*Its virtue is universal.*\n*The Dao flourishes.*\n\nThus, observe the self with the self—within, there is a single defilement, its virtue is not true.\nObserve the family with the family—there is one discord, its virtue lacks abundance.\nObserve the village with the village—there is one not transformed, its virtue does not endure.\nObserve the realm with the realm—there is one not virtuous, its virtue is not profound.\nObserve the world with the world—there is one petty man, its virtue is not universal.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n*Turn inward and examine oneself.*\n\n**Chapter 54**\n\nThe preceding chapter states: *\"Let me thus know with clarity—when knowledge arises, the Dao-heart is steadfast, unshaken in its holding, hence it follows.\"* For what is well-established cannot be uprooted.\n\nWith this, one cultivates the self, observes the heart, and examines nature—when the heart is settled, the self is refined.\nWith this, one governs the realm, observes the people, and examines oneself—when the people are transformed, the realm is governed.\n\nIf Heaven’s order has even one flaw, then it is because one’s own governance and transformation are flawed.\nAs the *Book of Documents* says: *\"When the people err, it lies with one man.\"*\nThis is what is meant.\n\nReflecting inward, if the heart harbors even a speck of defilement or attachment, then it is because my innate nature has not yet been illuminated.\n\n**Ode:**\nTo observe the realm is no simple task,\nTo observe the self—its meaning runs yet deeper.\nWhen the sea dries, its depths are revealed,\nBut when a man dies, his heart remains unknown.\n\nRich in virtue, he withdraws into seclusion—\nLike the infant.\nPure and undivided.\nVenomous creatures do not sting him,\nFierce beasts do not seize him,\nRaptors do not strike him.\n\n(*Shì* [螫], pronounced *shì* [释]. *Jué* [攫] and *yǎn* [玃], both pronounced *jué* [厥缚切].)\n\n「I lose myself in things, and things lose themselves in me.\nMy bones are frail, my sinews soft, yet my grasp is firm.\n(*Sīn* [筋], pronounced *jīn* [斤].)\nMy spirit is whole.\nI do not know the union of male and female yet *yīn* [绞] arises,\n(*Yīn* [绞], even tone.)\nMy essence is whole—\nthe utmost of essence.\nNatural and unrestrained.\nI wail all day yet my voice does not grow hoarse—\neven tone.\nMy *qi* is whole.\nThe utmost of harmony.\nKnowing harmony, I call it constant—\nthis is the Dao’s undifferentiated unity.\nKnowing constancy, I call it clarity—\nthis is the Dao’s boundless openness.\n\nTo nurture life is to invite misfortune;\nto increase is to bring loss.\nWhen the heart commands *qi*, it becomes strong.\nWhen *qi* moves, it becomes rigid.\nWhen things grow robust, they age;\nwhen rigid, they easily break.\nThis is called *not the Dao*.\n(*Cuò* [错].)\nNot the Dao is already premature death.\nTo lose one’s innate truth.\n\n**Chapter 55:**\nThe well-founded is unshaken—\nthe depth of virtue.\nThus, I follow it with the verse:\n*\"To hold the primordial face,\nFirst preserve the infant’s heart.\nThis heart ever unobscured,\nReveals the golden body of dharma.\nThe wise do not speak,\nSilence accomplishes all.\nSpeakers do not know—\nThe threefold mystery of the tongue.\nClose the mouth of speech,\nNo words escape.\nShut the gate of sight,\nNo forms enter.\nBlunt the sharpness of strife,\nNo contention.\nUnravel the tangled,\nNo affairs.\nHarmonize its radiance,\nNo self remains.\nMerge with the dust of things,\nNo others exist.\nThis is called *Mysterious Unity*.\nOne thread runs through all.\nThus, it cannot be grasped as near,\nForgetting emotion.\nIt cannot be cast aside as distant;\nForgetting form.\nIt cannot be exploited for gain,\nForgetting things.\nIt cannot be harmed by schemes,\nForgetting craft.\nIt cannot be prized as noble,\nForgetting possession.\nIt cannot be scorned as base,\nForgetting absence.\nThus, it is most noble in the world.\nAll forgetting exhausted, only true constancy remains.\"*\n\n**Chapter 56:**\nTo hold virtue’s depth is to remain silent,\nThus, I follow it with the verse:\n*\"The wise do not speak,\nFor there is nothing to be said.\nNon-speech is the Dao itself.\nThis is precisely what is meant.\n\nI say that many words bring gain,\nBut silence brings no harm.\nAlas.\nThe verse goes:\nCutting off gain ends all harm,\nNo closeness means no distance.\nMuch speech invites loss,\nBetter to be like *Zhuīlú* [觜卢] in retreat.\nWith rectitude govern the realm—\nno partiality, no favoritism.\nWith spontaneity wield the military—\nno schemes, no stratagems.\nWith non-action take the world—\nno doing, no grasping.\"*\n\n**Chapter 57:**\nHow do I know this to be so?\nBy this:\nNature penetrates *li* [理] and melts with *róng* [融].\nThe world abounds with taboos and prohibitions,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe delusions of desire for gain.\n\nThe people hoard many tools of profit,\nAnd the state becomes ever more corrupt.\nThe dazzle of rare commodities.\n\nMen indulge in cunning arts,\nAnd strange objects proliferate.\nThe shift toward superficial tricks.\n\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nAnd thieves and robbers abound.\nLaw begets deceit from above.\nThus, the sage says:\n*\"I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI do not prize schemes and stratagems.\nI cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI do not use tools of profit.\nI act without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI do not honor rare commodities.\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*\nSimplicity—*pǔ* [朴], pronounced *chú-bó* [蒲卜].\nTo govern with rectitude.\n\n**Chapter 58:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of *non-speech by the wise*,\nAnd thus attained its rectitude.\nHence, I follow with *governing with rectitude*.\n\nTaboos abound, tools of profit abound,\nCunning arts abound, laws and decrees abound—\nAll these are not rectitude.\nWhen the ruler has no taboos, the people thrive;\nCutting off schemes and stratagems, the people transform themselves;\nLightening taxes and levies, the people grow wealthy;\nGuiding them with virtue, the people return to simplicity.\nActing without doing, without affairs,\nWithout desire, cherishing stillness—\nAll these are rectitude.\nGovern with this, and the seas will be calm, the rivers clear;\nPractice the Dao with this, and the Dao will flourish, the times prosper;\nCultivate oneself with this, and the *qi* will solidify, the spirit congeal.\nOne person rectified, ten thousand people rectified;\nOne heart rectified, ten thousand transformations rectified;\nOne self rectified, ten thousand affairs rectified.\nGreat is the power of rectitude!\nThe verse says:\n*\"Fixing one’s mind brings endless error,\nNon-action again falls void.\nSince the heart’s path is severed,\nEvery day is spring breeze.\nHis governance is tranquil and broad,\nTranquil as the gate’s closing.\nNon-action brings ease and abundance.\nHis people are pure and sincere,\nSimple and unadorned, with virtue overflowing.\nHis governance is keen and strict,\nWith action, stern and precise.\nHis people are hollow and greedy,\nHollow as *quē* [缺], pronounced *yà* [轧].\nAvid and insatiable, their ruin is near.\nDisaster, disaster!—\nFortune depends upon it.\nFear disaster, and fortune will surely come.\nFortune, fortune!—\nDisaster lies hidden within.\nNeglect fortune, and disaster will surely arise.\nWho knows its limits?\nDisaster and fortune have no gates—\nOnly people invite them by themselves.\nIs it not rectitude that is lacking?\nOnly rectitude can be upheld.\nRectitude becomes strange,\nRelying on rectitude makes it strange.\nGoodness becomes demonic,\nPride in goodness makes it demonic.\nThe people’s confusion opposes the Dao,\nAnd their error grows with time.\nTheir confusion becomes distant and never returns.\nThus, the sage is square yet does not cut,\nSquare in his rectitude, letting his heart transform itself.\nModest yet not defiled,\nPure in his virtue, letting the people transform themselves.\nUpright yet not unrestrained,\nFirm in his conduct, letting things transform themselves.\nBright yet not blinding,\nHolding and nurturing his light, the world transforms itself.*\n\n**Chapter 59:**\nThe previous chapter continued the meaning of *governing with tranquil breadth*.\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nSpeaking of the state, it means lightening punishments and levies, reducing taxes;\nSpeaking of the self, it means moderating speech and actions, regulating drink and food;\nSpeaking of the heart, it means lightening thought and worry, severing sight and hearing.\nExhausting one’s heart, nurturing one’s nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\nThe verse says:\n*\"To live is to govern affairs, to govern affairs is to live;\nTo lighten affairs is to lighten living, to sever affairs is to sever life’s threads.\nClouds linger at the ridge’s peak, idle yet never fully clear,\nWater flows through the ravine’s depths, ever too busy to rest.\nTo govern a great state, as to poach a small fish—\nDisturb it, and it will fall apart.\nWith the Dao to rule the world, if one disturbs it, chaos follows.\nPoach it, and it will spoil.\nThe ghosts are not numinous,\nThe yin-demons bow their heads.\nNot that the ghosts are not numinous,\nBut that their numinosity does not harm people.\nEvil does not intrude upon rectitude.\nNot that their numinosity does not harm people,\nFor the sage also does not harm people.\nGreat measures do not cut.\nWhen the two do not harm each other, form and spirit both attain perfection.\nThus, virtue returns to its source, and the Dao resonates in harmony.\"*\n\n**Chapter 60:**\nTo govern with rectitude,\nHis governance is tranquil and broad,\nIn governing people and serving Heaven—\nAll these speak of governing a great state.\nA small fish—*xiǎo xiān* [小鲜], the delicate, tiny fish.\nLike poaching a small fish, disturbing it makes it spoil—\nSaying that to govern the world in peace,\nDisturbing it brings chaos.\n\nTo rectify one’s heart with non-action,\nTo nurture one’s nature with clarity and stillness,\nTo humble oneself in self-cultivation—\nThen the people’s hearts will be content and obedient,\nAnd the world will return to its source.\n\n「To act without harming others,\nThe world achieves peace.\nThe fierce and violent have no means to wield their power,\nAnd the spirits lose their fearsome nature.\n\nAs for transforming the violent into the virtuous,\nEven those with great strength lack the intent to harm.\nThe sage does not impose punishment upon the petty,\nAnd the ruler and ruled exchange virtue in harmony—\nHence, the two do not harm each other.\n\nIn cultivating oneself,\nClarity, purity, and non-action as the foundation,\nThen passions and desires are severed,\nAnd the hidden malevolence dissipates.\nThe body remains, and life endures;\nThe vital essence restores itself,\nAnd the spirit is whole—\nThis is the Dao of eternal longevity and enduring vision.\n\n**Ode:**\n*From the source, success is seen—\nWhy twist and strain?*\n*Once a spark ignites,\nEven a speck in the eye is a burden.*\n*A single stroke of insight,\nA thousand years of striking the donkey’s stake.*\n*The great state flows downward—\nThe highest virtue is like water.*\n*Where the world converges,\nMany lofty things attach to the low.*\n*The world’s receptivity—\nMany strong things cling to the yielding.*\n*The yielding ever overcomes the rigid with stillness,\nStillness as the lord of agitation.*\n*To be still is to be low—\nAll movement attaches to the still.*\n*Thus, the great state yields to the small,\nAnd takes the small;\nThe small serves the great,\nAnd yields to the great.*\n*Or the great yields to take the small—\nThe small must submit to the great.*\n*Or the great yields and takes—\nThe small must be absorbed by the great.*\n*The great state seeks only to embrace and nurture the people,*\n*Nurturing, the harsh entering as sound.*\n*The humble and lowly welcome the inferior,*\n*The small state seeks only to submit and serve others,*\n*The humble and obedient follow the superior.*\n*The two—superior yielding, inferior obeying—\nEach attains what it desires,*\nEach fulfills its proper role.*\n*Thus, the great ought to be low—\nThe high yields to the low as its base.*\n\n**Chapter 63:**\nTo act with non-action,\nTo reveal the essence of all things.\nNon-action encompasses all actions;\nAffairs without affairs achieve all things;\nTastes without tastes are profound and enduring.\nThese three are the mysteries of the Dao.\n\nThe great arises from the small,\nThe many from the few,\nRetaliation comes through virtue.\nTo plan for difficulty in the easy—\nThe easy is fragile and easily broken;\nTo build greatness from the minute—\nThe subtle is easily dispersed.\nThe world’s most difficult tasks begin with the easy,\nFrom the subtle to the manifest;\nThe world’s greatest undertakings begin with the minute,\nAccumulating small to great.\n\nThus, the sage never seeks to be great,\nThe sage does not claim sainthood.\nTherefore, he accomplishes true greatness.\nTrue sainthood lies with the people.\n\nThe sage finds difficulty in the easy,\nAnd does not lightly reveal it.\nThus, he never faces true difficulty.\nWhat is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty.\n\n**Chapter 62:**\nNon-action reveals the Dao’s essence—\nThe mysteries of all things.\n\nTo act with non-action,\nTo manage affairs without interference—\nTastes without indulgence,\nIts flavor is subtle and lasting.\nThese three are the Dao’s mysteries.\n\nThe great emerges from the small,\nThe many from the few,\nRetaliation comes through virtue.\nTo plan for difficulty in the easy—\nThe easy is fragile and easily broken;\nTo build greatness from the minute—\nThe subtle is easily dispersed.\nThe sage’s achievements are vast,\nYet he does not claim greatness.\n\nHeaven does not claim to be heaven—\nWhat makes heaven is the myriad things;\nThe sage does not claim to be sage—\nWhat makes the sage is the people.\nBecause he does not claim sainthood,\nHe attains true sainthood.\nTo be great must begin with the small,\nTo ascend must begin with the low—\nDifficult tasks are easily accomplished,\nEasy tasks are difficult to complete.\n\n**Chapter 61:**\nContinuing the *Jìzhǐ* chapter’s meaning of virtue’s exchange.\nThe lowly, like water’s descent,\nDraws all waters to itself.\nThe yielding overcomes the rigid,\nStillness overcomes movement.\nThe sage humbles himself in self-cultivation,\nRemains tranquil in response to things—\nThen the world transforms and attains perfection.\nThe superior yields to the inferior below,\nThe inferior yields and follows the superior above,\nSuperior yielding, inferior obeying—\nVirtue’s exchange returns to its source.\n\nIn cultivating oneself,\nThe more one lowers the heart, the higher the Dao ascends,\nThe more one retreats, the greater virtue advances,\nHumility and reverence bring radiance,\nLowliness cannot be surpassed—\nThus it is said: *The great ought to be low.*»\n\n**Ode:**\n*Busy all day, rushing about—\nTurn back, and you’re home.*\n*Once enlightened, there’s nothing to do,*\n*No chaos to entangle like hemp.*\n*To practice non-action,*\n*To conceal the spirit within the spirit,*\n*To manage

people.*\n*Light promises must be few in trust—*\n*Gained easily, lost easily.*\n*Many easy things bring many difficulties,*\n*Light and easy things are hard to complete.*\n*Thus, the sage regards even the easy as difficult,*\n*And does not lightly reveal it.*\n*Thus, he never faces true difficulty.*\n*What is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty.*\n\nThe easy is not lightly shown,\nFor lightly shown, men neglect it—\nThus the sage regards it as difficult.\n\nWhat is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty,\nAnd only what is not lightly taken will endure without trial.\n\n*Ode:*\nTo speak of ease is not ease,\nTo speak of difficulty is not difficulty.\nWithin its subtlety lies its marvel—\nThe North Star gazing southward.\n\nWhat is secure is easily held.\n*Ease, with falling tone.*\n*As below.*\n\nReside in ease yet fear danger.\nWhat is yet unseen is easily planned—\nAct, and plan at the beginning.\nWhat is fragile is easily broken—\nPlan difficulty from ease.\nWhat is subtle is easily dispersed—\nPlan greatness from the minute.\nAct before it exists,\nPrevent disaster before it arises.\nOrder before chaos,\nOrder before existence.\n\nA tree in arms’ embrace grows from a hair’s end—\nFrom the subtle to the manifest.\nA nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth—\nAccumulating small to great.\nA thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet—\nFrom near to far.\n\nThe doer undoes it—\nVigilance lies in the beginning.\nThe grasper loses it—\nVigilance ensures no loss.\n\nThus the sage, with no action, meets no defeat,\nWith no grasping, meets no loss.\nHolding fast yet never abandoning—\nTherefore, when the people act,\nThey have something to apply.\nYet often near completion, they fail,\nNot vigilant at the start—\nHow then can there be an end?\n\nTo treat the end as the beginning,\nThen no task shall fail.\nThe original heart unclouded—\nHow then can there be failure?\n\nThus the sage desires not to desire,\nDesires that others not desire.\nDoes not prize hard-won goods—\nTransforming things.\nTeaches those who do not learn,\nCorrecting the errors of the many—\nShifting virtue.\nAids the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet dares not act.\nThe wise fear the law.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four*\nContinuing the meaning above:\nWhat is secure is easily held—\nSpeaking of planning at the start,\nCultivated minds correct the heart before thought,\nRestrain emotion before encountering things,\nThen the heart is easily rectified,\nEmotion easily severed.\n\nIf governance comes after chaos,\nIf disaster is warded off after its sprouting—\nIs this not difficult?\nAccumulating small to great—\nOnce lost, it cannot be reclaimed.\nThus the *Yijing* warns: *Tread on frost, expect solid ice.*\nThe *Commentary* says:\n*A minister kills his lord, a son kills his father—*\nNot the work of a single morning or evening,\nBut a gradual descent,\nFrom failing to discern early enough.\nThe *Strike* says:\n*Evil not accumulated cannot destroy life.*\nAgain it says:\n*Evil accumulated cannot be undone.*\nHow can one not be warned?\n\nIf one awakens only after deviation,\nAnd with earnest effort returns—\nStill, it is not as good as resolving before form takes shape,\nWithout labor, restored.\nThus it is said:\n*The subtle is easily dispersed,*\n*The unseen is easily planned.*\n\nAgain it says:\n*The doer undoes,*\n*The grasper loses.*\nThe warning is yet more urgent.\n\nThe sage teaches those who do not learn,\nDesires that others not desire,\nWith no grasping, no action,\nConsistent from beginning to end,\nForever without peril.\n\nIf one attains this understanding,\nVigilant at the start—\nHow then can there be failure or loss?\n\nBefore a thing sprouts,\nAll signs appear—\nKnow it, and do not act;\nAct, and do not lose.\n\nOnly the Precious Nine—\nExhausting this Way—\nCould it be only Yanzi?\n\n*Ode:*\n*A hair’s deviation, a thousand-li’s loss.*\nRush back swiftly, yet still second.\nPressing the horse late to rein,\nThe boat at the river’s heart, mending too late.\n\nThe ancient skilled ruler\nDid not enlighten the people—\nNot knowing, not knowing.\nHe would deceive them.\nHis governance was dim.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nFor their cleverness is too much.\nHis governance was sharp.\nTo rule with cleverness is the state’s ruin;\nTo guide with cleverness leaves the people insufficient.\nNot to rule with cleverness is the state’s blessing;\nTo guide with virtue leaves the people with abundance.\nThese two are the standards.\n*Standard, pronounced as \"kǎi\" (口骇切).*\nWidely inclusive, yet lawful—no people.\nAlways knowing the standard,\nAbandoning the short for the long.\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue.*\nIn accord with the Way.\nMysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\nThe more one explores, the deeper it grows,\nThe more one seeks, the farther it stretches.\nIt reverses with things,\nNot consorting with all laws.\nOnly then does it reach the Great Harmony.\nGoing counter, yet aligning with transformation.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Five*\nWhat is secure is easily held—\nThe swift return to goodness.\nThus the next best ruler\nDoes not enlighten the people.\nSpeaking of no-action’s breadth,\nPeacefully governing the world—\nThe people’s blessing.\nWith action’s strictness,\nDominating the people—\nThe state’s ruin.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nFor they are too involved in affairs.\nThus the sage governs with no-action’s clarity and stillness,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nThough contrary to things,\nLong accustomed to nature,\nThe people thrive, reaping a hundredfold blessings,\nThe world harmonized, achieving Great Harmony’s transformation.\nExhausting this Way—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n*Ode:*\nAll conditioned things,\nThree thousand six hundred gates.\nExamined from the start,\nAll are but distractions of the spirit.\nOnly I embrace the nameless Primordial,\nEndless demons bow in surrender.\nThe sea and rivers rule all valleys\nBecause they are lowly.\nWith their skill in descending,\nGreat states flow downward—\nThus they rule all valleys.\nDifferent paths, same return.\nTherefore the sage, desiring to lead the people,\nSpeaks to them in humility.\nDesiring to precede the people,\nHe places himself behind.\nSelf-mastery.\nThus the sage, though above, does not burden the people—\nThe people forget their labor.\nThough before them, he does not harm the people—\nThe people forget their deaths.\nThus the world willingly follows without tiring.\n*Follow, pronounced as \"lè\" (音洛).*\nWith virtue, hearts are truly served.\nBecause he does not contend—\nHumility and yielding—\nThus none under heaven can contend with him.\nThe world is at peace.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Six*\nThe skilled ruler humbles himself to tend his own nature,\nThus next, likening himself to the sea ruling all valleys—\nThe meaning of *Supreme Goodness as Water.*\nSpeaking to the people in humility,\nThe people forget their labor;\n\n「With the body yielding to the people,\nThe people forget their deaths—\nAll through the resonance of *Dao* and virtue.\n\nThe true cultivator, humbling himself to tend his nature,\nThus refines his own being.\n\n*Ode:*\nSupreme Goodness as Water,\nBenefiting all without end.\nPiercing gold, traversing stone,\nSilently flowing past obstacles.\nWith intent, he holds the moon for a thousand miles—\nWithout intent, he sends the traveler on the wind’s sail.\n\nThe world all says my *Dao* is vast,\nAll things push to honor me.\nSeeming unworthy.\nWhen faced, I conceal it.\n\nOnly the great has no equal—\nThus seeming unworthy.\nSeeming what?\nIf worthy for long, it is trifling.\nOnce comparable, it is not great.\n\nI possess three treasures, worthless in exchange:\nGuard them carefully:\nFirst, *cì*—compassion, benevolence.\nSecond, *jiǎn*—frugality, moderation.\nThird, not daring to lead the world—\nHumility, withdrawal.\n\n*Cì* makes one courageous—\nNothing is unconquered.\n*Jiǎn* makes one expansive—\nNothing is lacking.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nThus one fulfills his role as vessel and leader—\nNone resist.\n\nNow abandoning *cì* and courage—\nIt is harshness and violence.\nAbandoning *jiǎn* and expansiveness—\nIt is greed and desire.\nAbandoning withdrawal for precedence—\nIt is tyranny and force.\nDeath.\nThe followers of death.\n\n*Cì* is *rén*—\nIn war, it conquers; the armies of the benevolent cannot be matched.\nIn defense, it is steadfast.\nBenevolence guards.\nHeaven aids those it would save,\nWith virtue as its support.\nWith *cì* as its shield.\nThe great virtue of Heaven and Earth is *shēng*—life;\nThe sage upholds his station with *rén*—benevolence.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Seven*\nThe lower the body, the higher the virtue—\nThus the sea rules all valleys.\nThe sage follows this,\nSo the world all honors him as great.\nUnworthy words have no equal—\nAgain, humble speech.\nCompassionate, forbearing, humble, withdrawn,\nFrugal, modest, lowly—\nThus seeming unworthy.\n\nThe common crowd all extols vastness, force, and the violent courage of blood and *qi*—\nYet they do not know that compassion, forbearance, humility, and withdrawal encompass the greatest vastness.\n\nThe single character *cì*—\nIn war, it conquers;\nIn defense, it is unshaken.\nThe benevolent have no rival—\nTrue courage.\n\n*Ode:*\nDo not drink the water of ignorance,\nCease generating distinctions.\nDispersed clouds clear the azure sky—\nTen thousand *li* of equal heaven.\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial—\nCompassionate, forbearing.\nThe skilled fighter does not rage—\nRage, pronounced as *nú* (音弩), rhymes with *wǔ* (武).\nSoft and yielding.\nThe skilled victor does not contend—\nHumility, yielding.\nThe skilled user of men is lowly—\nModest, deferential.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention—\nSupreme humility.\nThis is called using others’ strength—\nSupreme softness.\nThis is called aligning with Heaven—\nSupreme compassion.\nThe ancient perfect harmony with the *Dao*.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Eight*\nNot martial, not enraged, not contending—\nExpanding the meaning of *unworthy*.\nThe virtue of non-contention,\nUsing others’ strength—\nAll are expressions of *cì*—compassion,\nThus called *aligning with Heaven*.\nPracticing this for self-cultivation,\nThen life is preserved and longevity attained.\n\n*Ode:*\nNeither literary nor martial,\nNeither gain nor loss.\nTouching one’s nose,\nSweat pours from the body.\nPlainly beneath the eyes—\nYet separated by mountains in discussion.\n\nThere is a saying about warfare:\nI do not dare be host but am guest—\nCompassionate, forbearing.\nI do not dare advance an inch but retreat a *chǐ*—\nHumility, withdrawal.\nThis is called *no-action*—\nNo-action, pronounced as *háng* (下音杭).\nNot martial.\nNo arms—\nNo arms, pronounced as *rǎng* (如羊切).\nNot enraged.\nYet unconquered—\nNot contending.\nNo weapons—\nLowly.\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy,\nDaring courage leads to slaughter.\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly loses my treasures.\nStrong and tyrannical are the followers of death.\nThus when armies clash,\nThe first to engage is victorious.\nThe benevolent’s armies—\nUnmatched under Heaven.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Nine*\nContinuing the meaning of *not martial* from the last chapter.\nFrom *no-action* to *compassion triumphs*—\nAll are expressions of non-rage and non-contention.\n\n*Ode:*\nLoving victory ends in defeat,\nOnly compassion guards what is achieved.\nNo need for blades to wield,\nThe world celebrates peace.\n\nMy words are easy to know—\nCompassion and forbearance alone.\nEasy to practice—\nFrugality and moderation alone.\nYet none under Heaven can know—\nFaith is insufficient.\nNone can practice—\nStrength is insufficient.\n\nWords have their root—\nSpeaking reveals the *Dao*.\nDeeds have their master—\nActions display the *Dao*.\nOnly the ignorant remain blind—\nThus they do not know me.\nSeeing is unclear.\nFew know me—\nWho is the true connoisseur?\nThose who follow me are precious—\nWho dares to bear the responsibility?\nThus the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade.\nInternally treasuring *Dao* and virtue,\nExternally acting lowly and humble.\n\n*Chapter Seventy*\nThe previous chapter spoke of *compassion triumphs*—\nThus followed by *easy to know, easy to practice*.\nYet the world cannot know or practice—\nFaith is insufficient.\nAsking those who believe,\nYet they cannot act—\nStrength is insufficient.\nThus the sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade,\nConcealing brilliance within.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Supreme *Dao* is not difficult to know,\nYet human hearts cling to delusion.\nA hundred tangled knots dissolve—\nSuddenly reaching Caoqi.\nAutumn moon, spring flowers—boundless meaning,\nOnly you know its depth.\n\nKnowing the unknown—\nTrue knowing.\nUnknown yet knowing—\nIllness.\nFalse knowing.\nOnly the sick fear knowing—\nThus the unsick have no false knowing.\nThe sage is unsick,\nKnowing yet seeming unknowing.\nBecause he fears false knowing,\nHe forgets what he knows.\nThus unsick—\nKnowing all without knowing.\n\n*Chapter Seventy-One*\n*Knowing the unknown* above—\nContinuing from the last chapter’s *easy to know*.\nThe sage knows all yet does not claim to know—\nTrue knowing.\nThe world knows nothing yet claims to know—\nFalse knowing, thus *illness*.\nIf one knows false knowing as illness\nAnd fears that illness,\nThen the illness of false knowing is cured.\nThe sage remains unsick\nBecause he fears his excess of knowing—\nThus he is unsick.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\n\n*Ode:*\nHe who flaunts his black beard’s redness,\nWho boasts of hollowed lips in Daoist chanting—\nIf one can truly grasp this,\nThen enlightenment awaits not a donkey’s lifetime.\n\nThe people fear not the awe of virtue,\nNor restraint—\nThen great calamity descends.\nOne reaps what one sows.\nTo dwell without constraint,\nTo indulge in unrestrained desires—\nTo crave life without moderation.\n*Ulian*, level tone.\nLife’s excess is boundless.\nOnly he who does not crave\nErrs in excess.\nThus, he who does not crave\nErrs in excess.\nHence, the sage reverses this:\nKnowing himself yet not displaying,\nHe does not indulge his passions.\nLoving himself yet not esteeming,\nHe does not overvalue his life.\nThus, he discards that and takes this.\n*Qu*, pronounced *Jianglü* cut.\n\n*The people fear not the awe of virtue* above—\nContinuing from the last chapter’s *unknowing the knowing as illness*,\n*unknowing as knowing*—\nThus they lack restraint.\nHence follows the *Ode: The people fear not the awe of virtue*.\nCommon folk do not fear great virtue,\nDwelling without constraint,\nCraving life without moderation,\nStill seeking breadth and excess in life.\nNot knowing moderation brings ruin—\nThus it is said, *great calamity descends*.\nThose of the Dao reverse this.\n\n*Ode:*\nBitter gourd’s root is bitter to the core,\nSweet melon’s rind is sweet through to the stem.\nPitiful are those who cling to desire—\nThey know flavor yet not moderation.\nBoldness in daring leads to slaughter,\nThe overbearing are doomed to die.\nBoldness in not daring brings life,\nThe yielding are kin to vitality.\nKnowing these two,\nSome profit, some harm—\nLife and death intertwined.\nWhat Heaven abhors,\n*Wu*, pronounced *Wülü* cut,\nThe Creator does not endure.\nWho knows its reason?\nKnowing, one does not dare.\nThus the sage finds it hard.\nHe does not lightly reveal.\nHeaven’s Dao:\nWithout strife, yet triumphs,\nWithout contention, yet prevails.\nUnspoken yet answers well,\nGreat sound is faint—\nHarmony brings response.\nUnsummoned yet comes,\nSilent and motionless—\nStirred, it flows.\n*Shànrán* yet well-plotted.\n*Shàn*, pronounced *Zhàn*.\nFollowing nature’s course,\nIt conquers all.\nHeaven’s net vast and sweeping,\nEncompassing all without exclusion.\nThough sparse, it misses none.\nThough wide and open,\nNo thing can escape.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Three (Continuing from the previous chapter):**\nThe people do not fear authority,\nFor the world does not fear the law,\nDaring to revel in boldness—\nThe root of self-destruction.\n\nBoldness in not daring brings life,\nBoldness in daring is but the vigor of blood and breath—\nBoldness in not daring is the courage of virtue and principle.\n\n**Ode:**\nDaring to be bold, ever light in death,\nA stubborn ox fears no whip.\nObserve the reckless and base—\nHow many times their nostrils are pierced.\n\nThe people do not fear death,\nUnrestrained, they chase illusions.\nHow can one deter them with fear of death?\nIt is like embracing firewood to quench flames.\n\nIf the people were made to fear death,\nAnd those who act strangely were punished,\nBy appealing to their own desires—\nI would seize and execute them,\nNot letting any escape.\nWho would dare?\nWho would dare to defy?\n\nThose who habitually wield the sword,\nHeaven does not tolerate deceit.\nHe who substitutes for the executioner,\nIs not the proper one to wield the blade.\nThis is called *dài dàjiǎo zhǔo*—\nA carpenter’s apprentice wielding the adze.\nThe work does not concern him.\n\nHe who substitutes for the master carpenter,\nIs like a gatekeeper wielding the axe—\nFew escape unharmed.\nHe invites his own ruin.\n\n「Chapter 74 (Continuing the theme of daring to defy death from the previous chapter):\nThe people do not fear death—\nThis is because the governance and moral cultivation of the ruler are not good,\nAnd the people have lost their sustenance.\n\nWhen the people lose their sustenance,\nThey seek to fulfill their lives,\nAnd thus do not fear death.\n\nMoreover, if the ruler adds harsh punishments and prohibitions,\nForcing the people to fear death,\nThen this is driving the people to their own doom.\n\nExhausting the law leaves no people—\nThis is what Heaven abhors,\nAnd thus the Sage does not tolerate it either.\n\n*\"Constantly there are those who wield the blade\"*—\nThis means Heaven cannot be deceived.\n\n*\"He who substitutes for the executioner\"*—\nThis refers to those who hold the authority of punishment.\n\n*\"A carpenter’s apprentice wielding the adze\"*—\nThis is improper.\n\n*\"Few escape unharmed\"*—\nThis speaks of the extreme of punishment,\nWhich harms the harmony of the people.\n\nThe Sage warns against this and cautions against excessive punishment.\n\n**Ode:**\nThe void is silent, yet walls have ears.\n\nAsk how to act, and strike the chest immediately.\n\nThe Great Earth’s order is just—\nA long sword leaning on Heaven chills men to the bone.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from scarcity and famine—\nBecause their ruler’s taxes and exactions are too heavy,\nGreed leads to famine, and excessive desires bring chaos.\nThus, they hunger, and it is always insufficient.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance comes from disorder and confusion—\nBecause their ruler’s actions are too contrived,\nExcessive affairs lead to chaos.\nThus, they are hard to govern, and it is always unstable.\n\nThe people’s disregard for death comes from forgetting their fate—\nBecause their pursuit of life is excessive,\nGreed knows no bounds.\nThus, they dare to defy death,\nUnmindful of peril and ruin.\n\nOnly he who does not cling to life,\nWho does not indulge in it,\nIs wiser than those who prize life.\nHe does not cling to life himself,\nAnd thus attains lasting life.\n\n**Chapter 75 (Continuing the theme of the people not fearing death):**\nThe people’s hunger, their difficulty in governance,\nArises from improper governance and moral cultivation—\nThe people do not fulfill their lives,\nAnd thus cling to life while unmindful of peril and ruin.\n\nGovern them with the law and they will rebel;\nGovern them with virtue and they will submit.\nIf the ruler cherishes tranquility,\nThe people will find joy and follow his transformation.\n\n**Ode:**\nWisdom is but filth,\nCunning is but dust.\nDetach even the slightest thought,\nAnd the nature of the boundless sea clarifies itself.\n\nThe people’s life is soft and weak—\nA single mass of harmonious *qi*.\nTheir death is hard and strong—\nThe harmonious *qi* disperses.\nAll things, grasses, and trees in their life are soft and tender,\nWith harmonious *qi* intact.\nIn their death, they wither and dry—\nThe harmonious *qi* is gone.\nThus, the hard and strong are those who die,\nFor rigidity and violence are the roots of self-destruction.\nThe soft and weak are those who live,\nFor gentleness and harmony are the keys to nurturing life.\nTherefore, strong arms do not conquer,\nRelying on strength leads to defeat.\nStrong wood bends,\nAnd strong wood snaps.\nStrength in excess brings ruin—\nThe root of sinking low.\nWeakness in moderation brings elevation—\nThe symbol of rising high.\n\n**Chapter 76 (Continuing the theme):**\nWhen the ruler’s governance and moral cultivation are not good,\nAnd harm the harmonious *qi*,\nThen the world is filled with rigidity and violence.\n\nBy practicing non-action in purity and simplicity,\nAnd refining oneself,\nOne can restore the harmonious *qi*—\nThe people fulfill their lives,\nFind joy in their work,\nAnd without testing punishments, all are content and obedient.\nHow could there still be rigidity and violence?\n\nThus, cultivating order and governing peace\nAll depend on gentleness and harmony.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Daoist *elixir* (丹道),\nWhen harmonious *qi* remains,\nWater and fire support each other;\nWhen harmonious *qi* disperses,\nWater and fire oppose each other—\nThus, weakness in moderation is elevated.\n\n**Ode:**\nSoftness and weakness are not good,\nHardness and strength are not evil.\nBetter to nurture the Great Harmony,\nAnd dwell in perpetual ease and joy.\n\nIs not Heaven’s Dao like drawing a bow?\nBalancing and applying force to things.\nThe high are lowered,\nThe low are raised.\nThe abundant are diminished,\nThe lacking are supplemented.\nThe many are reduced,\nThe few are increased.\n\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to supplement the lacking,\nAnd takes from the full to give to the modest.\nBut man’s Dao is the opposite—\nHe takes from the lacking to serve the abundant,\nAnd harms others to benefit himself.\nWho can give their abundance to serve the world?\nWho can harm themselves to benefit others?\nOnly the Daoist can.\n\nThe Sage acts without relying on it,\nAnd diminishes.\nThe Sage accomplishes without taking credit,\nAnd diminishes.\nHe does not wish to be seen as virtuous—\n*\"Seen\"* (見) pronounced *xiàn*.\nDiminish even the diminished.\n\n**Chapter 77** *(Continuing the theme of strength and weakness from the previous chapter—benefiting the deficient, harming the excessive: the Great Dao)*\n\nThe strong and mighty must be diminished,\nThe weak and feeble must be benefited.\nOnly the Daoist aligns with Heaven’s Way,\nDiminishing desire to nurture true nature,\nReducing excess to supplement deficiency,\nSacrificing self to benefit others,\nTaking from the abundant to give to the lacking—\nDiminishing again and again,\nUntil arriving at *wuwei* (non-action).\n\n*Ode:*\nTo benefit the ever-deficient—\nDiminish, and abundance returns.\nOnly this heart of self-mastery\nIs the equalizing scale.\n\nNone are softer or weaker than water—\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\nYet none can conquer the firm and strong—\nA blow cannot split it.\nNothing can replace it.\nNo comparison exists.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe yielding prevails.\nThe weak overcomes the strong,\nThe pliable erodes the rigid.\nAll know this,\nYet none can practice it—\nThe burden is too great.\n\nThus the Sage says:\n*Listen closely.*\nTo bear a nation’s impurities,\nOne may become its sovereign—\nThe sea embraces all rivers.\nTo bear a nation’s misfortunes,\nOne may become ruler of the world.\nTo dwell where others abhor,\nTo speak truth as if reversed—\nTo oppose the world’s ways.\n\n**Chapter 78** *(Continuing the theme of diminishing and benefiting)*\n\nNone are as low or weak as water,\nYet it breaches dams and carves cliffs—\nNone can resist it.\nThus it is clear:\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nAll know this, yet none can practice it—\nWhy?\nBecause they refuse humility.\n\nWhat others abhor—impurity and misfortune—\nOnly the Daoist can bear.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe weak submit to weakness,\nThe strong submit to strength.\nAbandon discriminating thoughts,\nRecognize the King of the Law.\nObserve only the boundless, endless water—\nWherever it flows, round or square.\nTo reconcile great grudges\nOnly breeds more grudges;\nKindness repaid with resentment—\nHow can this be called good?\n*Error.*\n\n**Chapter 79** *(Continuing the theme of yielding and strength)*\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract—\n*Contract*, pronounced *qiè* (挈).\nBelow, same pronunciation.\n*Leaf*, pronounced *chè* (彻).\nSincerity and trust extend to all things,\nDemanding nothing in return.\nMastering oneself,\nThus possessing virtue to govern the contract—\nNature serene, emotions at ease.\nLacking virtue to govern *leaf*—\nMind agitated, spirit exhausted.\n\nHeaven’s Dao is impartial, utterly just,\nEver aligning with the Sage.\nOnly the Way is followed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 80** *(Continuing the theme of yielding and strength)*\n\nTo reconcile grudges with kindness\nDissolves the grudge, yet the heart remains.\nHow can this be called good?\nBetter to blame oneself,\nForgiving both grudge and kindness—\nThen the people’s hearts naturally respond with trust.\n\nThe virtuous govern the contract,\nThe lesser-virtued govern *leaf*.\n*Leaf* is clarity—\nOnly knowing clarity as decisive judgment,\nYet failing to see that exhausting the law leaves no people.\nHow can this be called good?\nThose who govern the contract uphold sincerity,\nBinding with the people’s hearts.\n\n*Ode:*\nDecisive judgment harms harmonious *qi*,\nKindness invites misfortune.\nBetter to govern the left contract,\nForgiving both grudge and kindness.\n\nIn small states with few people,\nNo greed—\nThough possessing tenfold or hundredfold tools, they do not use them.\nNo reverence for the worthy—\nLet the people hold death dear,\nYet not wander far.\nContent with their lot—\nThough there are boats and chariots, they ride none;\nNo movement.\nThough there are arms, they are not displayed;\nNo strife.\nLet the people return to knotted cords for record,\nReverting to simplicity.\nDelight in their food, forgetting taste.\nAdmire their garments, forgetting form.\nFind comfort in their dwellings, forgetting motion.\nTake joy in their customs—\n*Joy*, pronounced *luò* (洛).\nForgetting sorrow.\nNeighboring states face each other,\n*Face*, level tone.\nNo regard for external sights.\nThe sounds of chickens and dogs are heard,\nYet external sights do not enter,\nInternal thoughts do not exit.\nThe people live until old age,\nTheir entire lives in the Dao.\nNo mutual visits.\nForgotten are *this* and *that*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 81** *(The final chapter, summarizing the eighty preceding chapters)*\n\nThe Sage does not accumulate,\nNeither adding nor subtracting.\nThe more he gives to others, the more he possesses.\nThe more he bestows, the more he has.\nBoundless salvation.\n\nHeaven’s Dao is ever-generating,\nBenefiting without harm,\nBenefiting all without exception.\nThe Sage’s Dao follows Heaven’s course,\nActing without strife,\nCompassionate, patient, frugal, and restrained.\n\n---\n**Ode:**\nTrue words lack beauty,\nHarsh truths are unpalatable.\nBeautiful words lack truth.\n*Mouth* threefold *dhyāna*—\nThe good do not argue,\nNo discriminating thoughts.\nThose who argue are not good,\nGiving rise to distinctions.\nTrue knowing is not extensive,\nEvery head is complete.\nThe extensive do not know things,\nEach obstructing the other.\nThe Sage does not hoard,\nNeither increasing nor decreasing.\nHaving given to others, he is ever more useful.\nHaving given to others, he is ever more abundant.\n\nHeaven’s great virtue is *shēng* (生),\nThus benefiting without harm.\nThe Sage’s virtue follows Heaven,\nGuarding his place as *rén* (仁),\nThus acting without strife.\n\nThis final chapter exhausts the meaning of the eighty preceding.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao,*\n*The name that can be named is not the eternal Name.*\nSilent teaching, benefit through non-action,\nRare words naturally arise,\nFlavorless and insipid,\nAdvancing the Dao seems like retreat,\nIlluminating the Dao seems like obscurity,\nExtensive virtue seems insufficient;\nGreat whiteness seems like disgrace.\n*Xī* (希) and *yí* (夷),\nVague and indistinct,\nGreat sound is rare,\nGreat vessels mature late,\nRight speech seems reversed—\nThough these words may not please the ear,\nWithin them lies truth, hence:\n*\"True words lack beauty.\"*\n\n*The Dao that can be spoken, the Name that can be named,*\nVisible and audible—\nFilled to excess, measured to sharpness,\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nDoing good is called good,\nBeauty is called beautiful,\nMusic and bait—\nSound and flavor both delightful—\nThough pleasing to the ear,\nThey are ultimately unreal, hence:\n*\"Beautiful words lack truth.\"*\n\nIf stammering, if clumsy,\nIf foolish, if crude,\nIf bent, if dim,\nNot revering one’s own worth,\nNot valuing rare goods,\nDignified as a guest,\nSincere as the uncarved block,\nVast as a valley,\nMuddled as turbid water,\nKnowing white yet guarding black,\nKnowing honor yet guarding disgrace,\nNot seeing oneself, not affirming oneself,\nNot boasting, not praising oneself—\nAll these are the goodness of non-argument.\n\nRevering the strange, coveting wealth,\nExalting oneself, magnifying oneself,\nSeeing oneself, affirming oneself,\nBoasting, praising oneself,\nBold and daring,\nGreedy in desire,\nFearless of authority,\nFearless of death,\nNever satisfied,\nNever stopping,\nForcing knowledge of what is ahead,\nBright and discerning—\nAll these are the evil of argument.\n\nNot stepping outside,\nYet knowing the world,\nNot peering through windows,\nYet seeing the Dao,\nSealing the senses,\nClosing the gates,\nDulling the sharp,\nUntangling the tangled,\nHarmonizing the bright,\nBlending with the dust—\nWithout speech, yet trusted,\nWithout sight, yet named,\nWithout action, yet accomplished—\nAll these are the meaning of *\"true knowing is not extensive.\"*\n\nThe knowing of things and people,\nThe knowing of affairs and the outer world,\nWithout confining one’s dwelling,\nWithout exhausting one’s life—\nOpening the senses,\nAiding in affairs,\nDiscarding frugality for generosity,\nDiscarding what comes later for what comes first,\nClaiming knowledge while knowing nothing—\nAll these are the folly of the overlearned.\n\nActing yet not clinging,\nLeading yet not ruling,\nAccomplishing yet not dwelling upon it,\nAbandoning the sage’s wisdom,\nAbandoning benevolence and righteousness,\nAbandoning cleverness and profit,\nMinimizing self and desire,\nEmbracing simplicity and returning to the uncarved,\nDiminishing again and again,\nUntil reaching non-action,\nAvoiding excess, extravagance, and excessiveness,\nWithout knowledge, without affairs, without desire—\nAll these are the meaning of *\"non-accumulation.\"*\n\nAs for bending to preserve, distorting to straighten,\nHollowing to fill, wearing out to renew,\nAll things returning to it,\nAll people transforming through it,\nHeaven and Earth uniting with it,\nWidely bestowing and aiding,\nNever exhausted, never depleted,\nNever failing, never laboring,\nIts use never ceasing—\nThis is the meaning of *\"the more one gives to others, the more one has.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven generates, forms, circulates, and transforms,\nBalancing and applying to all things,\nNurturing and storing them,\nGrowing and fostering them,\nCompleting and ripening them,\nNourishing and sheltering them,\nBenefiting all without harm,\nUtterly impartial, without selfishness,\nAided only by virtue,\nResponding to goodness without being summoned,\nComing naturally when called upon,\nLowering the high, raising the low,\nReducing the excessive, supplementing the deficient—\nAll sentient beings are encompassed without exception.\nThis is benefit without harm.\n\nThe Sage’s Way:\nHolding to the receptive, embracing unity,\nDwelling in softness, practicing humility,\nBlending light with dust,\nPutting others before oneself,\nAligning with the Dao,\nAligning with virtue,\nAligning with loss,\nSquare yet not rigid,\nStraight yet not domineering,\nBright yet not dazzling,\nNot demanding of others,\nLending generously and completing the task,\nRewarding the good and also benefiting the unworthy,\nIn small states with few people,\nContent with sufficiency,\nReturning the people to simplicity,\nForgetting distinctions of self and other,\nSo that people die of old age without traveling far—\nAll these are the meaning of *\"non-contention.\"*\n\nOnly these two characters—*\"non-contention\"*—\nAre the essence of eighty chapters.\n\nIf one truly believes this,\nAnd applies *\"non-contention\"* in daily life,\nWith prolonged practice and refinement,\nOne will naturally attain the realm of the Primordial Oneness,\nAnd the eternal Dao will be fully realized.\n\nThus, the Sage before the Emperor\nAlready grasped the original clarity and subtlety.\n\nNow, how does *\"non-contention\"* function?\nAh, lay down the profit-seeking pole at the gate.\n\nOde:\nContention is always wrong,\nYielding brings abundance.\nWithout contention, merit is unbroken,\nAll transformations return to it.\n\n*Moral Essentials, Volume Two, ends.*",

      "translated_text": "**The *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\n**Text Title:** *Dao and Virtue Compendium* (*Daode Huiyuan*)\nAuthor: Li Daochun of the Yuan dynasty\nTwo fascicles, upper and lower\nSource edition: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Dongshen* section, *Yujue* category\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\nI humbly observe that Fu Xi drew the *Yi* to reveal the Primordial Heaven, while Laozi composed his book to fully manifest the Dao and virtue. These two works may well be the ancestors of all scriptures. Yet today’s scholars, failing to grasp their principles—how lamentable! The fault lies in not receiving their true transmission.\n\nI, though untrained in letters, sought widely and visited many masters until I encountered a perfected one who unlocked the *Yi* in my heart, allowing me to attain the subtleties of its profound meaning. Thereupon, I exhausted what I had gained and compiled the *Essence of the Three Heavens’ Yi*, which I transmitted to my disciples. Only Laozi’s *Daodejing* remained unmastered.\n\nOne day, a certain Chuan Ji’an brought me the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity. Upon examining its annotations, I found them largely in accord with the text, though some parts were incomplete. I wished to add my own glosses but hesitated after careful reflection.\n\nLater, two or three disciples each presented several commentaries by various masters, seeking my instruction. Comparing them with the original scripture, I found many discrepancies: some had an extra word, others a missing word; some entire sentences diverged, or characters were corrupted. Each had its strengths and weaknesses, yet all differed.\n\nI sighed: If even the original scripture is thus, how much more so the commentaries? When asked the reason, I replied: Initially, copyists made errors. Later, printing blocks had omissions or misalignments, and where earlier interpretations were unclear, later scholars arbitrarily added to them, perpetuating distortions and creating fragmentation.\n\nSomeone asked: Which version is correct?\nI said: The *Zhangju* of Master He Shang and the *Precious Chapters on the Dao and Virtue* by the Perfected One of Purple Clarity are quite coherent.\nWhy?\nBecause those that align with the logical flow of the text above and below are correct.\n\nWhat of the other interpretations?\nEach reflects a different perspective, clinging to one aspect alone.\n\nMay I ask for details?\nThey stem from private conjecture, not flowing from one’s own insight, and thus cannot be broadly applied. Those versed in governance cling to governance; those in the alchemical Dao, to the alchemical Dao; those in military strategy, to military strategy; those in Chan, to Chan. Some speak of principle but not practice; others, of practice but not principle. As for expedient means, clever schemes, or roundabout paths, they fall into partiality and lose the Sage’s original intent.\n\nLittle do they realize that the Sage’s purpose in composing the scripture was to establish the ultimate before Heaven and Earth, to operate beyond yin and yang. In the space between covering and supporting, every affair and principle is complete—how could one cling to a single aspect and speak of it thus?\n\nThereupon, I ventured to speak, pointing out where others’ interpretations were incoherent or contrary to the Sage’s meaning, presenting them to my disciples. All agreed. Thereafter, seekers came repeatedly, leaving me no choice but silence. I proceeded to add annotations to each line of the original scripture, elucidating its meaning to verify the essentials of nurturing spirit and cultivating qi. For each chapter, I summarized its principle to clarify the sequence of investigating the root and exhausting the source. After each chapter, I composed verses to fully reveal the mechanism of illuminating the mind and seeing one’s nature.\n\nAs for the matters of cultivating the self, ordering the family, governing the state, and pacifying the realm; the regulations and laws; the daily concerns of the common people; and the path of ordinary conduct—whether vast or minute, broad or subtle, nothing is not encompassed within. I further composed two discourses, *Rectifying Words* and *Investigating Principle*, placing them at the scripture’s beginning to clarify proper terminology and thoroughly examine its meaning, thereby resolving the confusions of discrepancies in the text. I titled this work the *Dao and Virtue Compendium*, so that later learners may delve deeply and savor it, entering according to their understanding, and thus avoid falling into partiality, ultimately merging with the supreme Dao and returning to the origin.\n\nThough my words are coarse and unrefined, I have done no more than provide straightforward explanations. I dare not claim the scripture’s meaning as my own. Yet compared to other versions, this may come closer. May those of like mind in later times take note.\n\nWritten on the first day of the fourth lunar month in the *gengyin* year of the Zhiyuan era (1290) by Li Daochun, the Learned One of Clear Hermitage of Duliang, styled Yuánsù.\n\n---\n\n**Prefatory Notes to the *Dao and Virtue Compendium***\n\n**Rectifying Words**\n\nAmong the various versions of the scripture I have examined, only the edition by the Venerable He Shang is correct. Even the He Shang edition has three variants: one with He Shang Gong’s annotations, one with two complete commentaries, and one with the *Zhangju* in plain text. Among these, only the plain-text *Zhangju* of the Venerable He Shang is superior in principle, and I have followed it. I have thus exposed the erroneous interpretations of other versions to rectify their deviations. Beyond this, there are over two hundred instances of minor discrepancies, which I shall not enumerate here. This brief account suffices to dispel scholars’ doubts.\n\nIn Chapter Two, the six phrases beginning with \"Being and non-being give birth to one another\" should not each include the word *zhi* (之).\nIn Chapter Three, \"Therefore the Sage empties their heart\" should not be rendered as \"the Sage governs,\" \"governs it,\" or \"governs it thus.\"\nIn Chapter Eleven, the six phrases beginning with \"Embracing the One, can you not part from it?\" should not each include the word *hu* (乎).\nIn Chapter Thirteen, \"Favor is high, disgrace is low\" should not be rendered as \"favor is low,\" which contradicts the scripture’s meaning.\nIn Chapter Sixteen, \"Cautious, as if crossing a river in winter\" should not be rendered as \"together with\" (*yu*, 與) or omit *xi* (兮) in the following three of six phrases.\nIn Chapter Seventeen, \"Next, they fear him; next, they revile him\" should not be rendered as \"they fear and revile him.\"\nIn Chapter Twenty, \"Dim, as if obscured\" should not be rendered as \"bland, as if the sea.\"\n\"Valuing the mother of sustenance\" should not be rendered as \"the child values seeking sustenance from the mother.\"\nIn Chapter Thirty, some versions have three extra characters or one or two missing.\nIn Chapter Thirty-One, \"Victory is not beautiful\" should not be rendered as \"thus it is not beautiful.\"",

      "translated_text": "Some versions render \"love and nurture\" in Chapter Thirty-Four as \"clothing and coverings\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Thirty-Six, dividing \"softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength\" into two phrases is wrong. In Chapter Thirty-Nine, \"counting the parts of a chariot yet having no chariot\" is sometimes misread as \"counting praises\"—this is also incorrect. In Chapter Forty-Nine, adding the particle *yi* (矣) after \"virtue is good, virtue is trustworthy\" is wrong. In Chapter Fifty-Two, \"having served the mother, one knows the child\" is sometimes misconstrued as \"having known the mother, one further knows the child\"—both versions are incorrect. In Chapter Fifty-Five, \"excessive life brings misfortune\" is sometimes rendered as \"daily life\" or \"it is called life\"—both are wrong. Chapter Sixty-Six contains several discrepancies in phrasing. In Chapter Seventy-One, \"to know yet not know\" is sometimes expanded to \"to know yet not know is superior\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Seventy-Seven, \"who can take their surplus to serve the world\" is sometimes interpolated with \"those lacking\"—this is wrong. In Chapter Seventy-Eight, \"nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water\" is sometimes misphrased as \"nothing is softer or weaker than water\"—this is incorrect. In Chapter Eighty, \"to cause the possession of tools for ten or a hundred yet not use them\" is sometimes rendered as \"ordering tools\" or \"not using them\"—both are wrong.\n\n**Investigating the Principle**\nExamining the various editions and their interpretations, those that do not align with the Sage’s meaning are here exposed. The discrepancies and errors are numerous, and I do not wish to enumerate them all—scholars should reflect deeply on this.\n\n*\"Always without desire, to observe its mystery\"*\nSome punctuate this as a single phrase, \"always without,\" or claim, \"Those without desire preserve themselves; those with desire perish.\" If those with desire truly perish, why speak of \"together calling it the profound\"? Could perishing be called the profound? I say: \"Without desire\" means acting without contrivance, naturally. \"With desire\" means applying effort with intention. Non-action reveals the mystery of the nameless, preserving one’s nature. Action reveals the thoroughness of the named, preserving one’s life. Being and non-being, nature and life—these emerge from the same source yet bear different names, together called the profound, the profound within the profound. When being and non-being interpenetrate, nature and life are both fulfilled.\n\nThe *Record* states: \"Before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are expressed, it is called the Center. The Center is the great root of the world—this is the meaning of 'without desire, observe the mystery.' When expressed and all meet their measure, it is called Harmony. Harmony is the universal Dao of the world—this is the meaning of 'with desire, observe its manifestations.' Achieving the Center and Harmony, heaven and earth take their places, and the ten thousand things are nurtured—this is the meaning of 'the profound within the profound.'\"\n\nThe term \"desire\" refers to desiring what others do not desire.\n\n*\"Not exalting the worthy\"*\nSome render this as \"not seeking worthy scholars\" or \"not employing the worthy\"—both are incorrect. If the worthy were truly not employed, this scripture would be unworthy of evidence, for such a principle could not exist.\n\n*\"The gate of the mysterious female\"*\nSome identify the mouth and nose as the gate of the mysterious female—this is wrong. Others suggest it refers to where thoughts arise—this is somewhat plausible but still does not align with the scripture’s meaning.\n\n*\"Bearing the *po*\"*\nSome interpret this as \"soul and *po*,\" others as \"yin and yang,\" and there are several other explanations—all are untenable. They fail to recognize that the *po* delights in movement; \"bearing\" it means to govern it.\n\n*\"Thirty spokes\"*\nSome explain this as the number of days in a month, others as the fire of cultivation—both are incorrect. They do not grasp that the Sage’s intent does not lie in the number thirty.\n\n*\"Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom\"*\nSome claim sageliness and wisdom are insufficient and should be discarded—this is wrong. I say: the Sage does not employ sageliness and wisdom to be seen by the people.\n\n*\"Abandon learning, and there is no sorrow\"*\nSome take this to mean \"abandoning learning is not learning\"—this is incorrect.

      "translated_text": "**Composed by Li Daochun Yuanfu of Qing’an, the Pure Toad Hermitage of Duliang**\n\n**Dao**\nThat which can be spoken of as the Dao is not the true and constant Dao. The true and constant Dao begins in the beginningless, is named in the nameless. To conceive or discuss it is already to deviate; to open one’s mouth is already to err. If it could be spoken of, what would the Dao be? Since it cannot be spoken of, how then is the Dao to be perceived? If it is neither what can be spoken nor what cannot be spoken, how then is it to be realized? Should one manage to turn the phrase here, the work of inquiry is complete—if not, one must seek within the twelve hours of the day, in rising and resting, in eating and dwelling, in every moment of turning the mind, to examine and discern what it is that stands so steadfast, so vividly alive, never opposing any condition. Examine and discern again and again, until one reaches the point where examination and discernment fail—suddenly, as if grasping one’s own nostrils, the whole body breaks into sweat. Only then does one realize that this original thing has always been one’s own, unchanged since time immemorial. This is what is meant by the Dao, from which one cannot be parted even for an instant. Again, it is said: in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, one does not depart from this. How much more so between heaven and earth, where every thing and every phenomenon is this, from ancient times to the present, only this—giving birth to heaven and earth, only this. In daily life, in movement and stillness, in activity and rest, it is only this. All that has form will decay, but the nature of this remains constant. Even heaven, earth, and the void will decay, yet this alone does not. This alone cannot be seen through, though not for iron eyes or bronze pupils. Why can it not be seen through? Only because one has never truly encountered it face to face. Even if one were to encounter it face to face, one would still miss it. And where would one have missed it? Do not wander aimlessly—after all, how does one understand it? Here, it is perfectly clear, yet only lacks someone to bear witness to it. Should one meet a true friend, one would raise one’s brows and offer it up.\n\n*Crack!* Last night, new rain passed by the riverbank;\nThis morning, the distant mountains remain as green.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe ultimate of the Dao is emptiness, void, and stillness,\nWithout image, without form, without name, without substance.\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be grasped, cannot be heard,\nNor can its traces be found.\nVast, it encompasses all; subtle, it enters all.\nIt gives birth to heaven and earth, nurtures the ten thousand things,\nIts transformations endless, its hiddenness and manifestation unfathomable.\nIt cannot be known by knowing, cannot be recognized by recognizing.\nThe Most High Laozi, whose tongue had no bone,\nIn this scripture, clearly revealed it.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—better to remain silent.\nThis is the end of doubt.\n\n**Virtue/Power**\nThe word *virtue* is also a forced name, impossible to describe or grasp. Any contrivance, accumulation of merit, or layering of practice is not virtue. To remain thus, without cultivation, without effort, like dead ashes or withered wood, waiting for virtue to come of itself—one will have no virtue for a lifetime. The more one seeks virtue, the farther it recedes; the more one clings to it, the more it is lost. The scripture says: “The highest virtue does not act as virtue, and thus possesses virtue.” And again: “The highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose.” These two lines are abundantly clear—only lacking someone to bear witness to them. If one is truly faithful, one will overturn all prior learning, understanding, and knowledge—all the teachings of the Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas—and in the midst of ordinary practice, take up the word *diminish* and put it to use. Diminish again and again, diminishing until one reaches the point where nothing more can be diminished. Then, mysterious virtue shines forth, and one trusts that non-action is indeed beneficial. The scripture says: “The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few in the world attain it.” And again: “Mysterious virtue is profound, far-reaching.” Do you understand?\n\n*Hmm!* It does not depart from where it constantly abides,\nYet if sought, you will find it cannot be seen.\n\n**Verse:**\nThe river-sands of wondrous virtues all reside within the mind.\nNo need for effort—why labor to cultivate and accumulate?\nThe more one delves, the deeper it becomes; the more one clings, the more it is lost.\nLet go of all things, overturn all phenomena.\nPut others before oneself, embrace the feminine, hold to the One.\nPure and undivided, one’s virtue becomes real.\nSelf-cultivation, family regulation, governance, and peace—all emerge from this.\nIts wondrous function is immeasurable—this is called mysterious virtue.\n\n**Scripture**\nThe word *scripture* is also a forced name. In the beginning, the sage saw that people followed illusions with their emotions, were deluded by desires, and true nature was lost amid the turmoil of karmic consciousness and the blazing of ignorance. Thus, the original heaven was forsaken, and people suffered premature death and injury, unable to return to their fundamental source. Therefore, using the power of skillful means, the sage opened the gate of good guidance, leading the deluded multitude back to the true Way. Thus, he composed books and established teachings, forcibly naming them *scriptures*. *Scripture* means *path*—the great road traveled by all. Yet those who read this scripture must not cling to the trance of language, nor should they abandon this scripture to seek elsewhere. One must turn one’s attention to one’s own being, carefully chewing over these five thousand words, examining each point and stroke, not letting anything slip by. Suddenly, when one thoroughly digests even a single phrase, this entire scripture resides within oneself. Only then does one trust that the opening of the Dao does not depend on the tongue. Here, one unlocks one’s own treasure store, brings forth one’s own scripture, wields it freely and without constraint. Not only this scripture, but all thirty-six revered scriptures and the entire canon of teachings—from beginning to end, with a single shout, one fully comprehends them all.\n\nA storm rises from level ground,\nA thunderclap splits the clear sky—\nListen carefully, listen carefully!\n\n**Verse:**\nThis single scroll of scripture—\nIts wondrous function is beyond praise.\nEach person inherently possesses it,\nEvery thing is perfectly complete.\nStraightforward and unobstructed,\nVast and unconfined.\nUnchanging through kalpas,\nUnaltered since ancient times.\nEverywhere it functions,\nEverywhere it serves as a thoroughfare.",

      "translated_text": "These four chapters above speak of acting through non-action, thus following with *\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible—perhaps it does not fill,\"* which means it does not overflow of itself. One who does not overflow of himself must receive benefit. To blunt sharpness and untangle knots is to empty the center and forget the self. *\"I do not know whose child it is—it precedes the Supreme Emperor\"* transcends the bounds of emptiness and nothingness.\n\n**Verse:**\nNot knowing whose child it is,\nHow could one know it precedes the Supreme Emperor?\nFor you, I make it clearly known—\nIt was before the Great Ultimate was divided.\n\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nThey act through non-action,\nTreating the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThey nurture the ten thousand things yet do not claim mastery.\nThe sage is not benevolent,\nEmulating Heaven,\nTreating the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe myriad people return to him yet he does not claim mastery.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nIt is empty at the center,\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible in use.\nEmpty yet never depleted,\nWithout intent,\nMoving yet ever more emerges.\nResponding to change without end.\nThe more words are spoken, the sooner they fail—\nIt is better to guard the center,\nTo be empty at the center, and nothing more.\n\nThese five chapters above:\nHeaven covers and Earth bears,\nTransforming the people and nurturing things—\nThis may be called utmost benevolence.\nTo speak of \"not benevolent\" is to forget their origin.\nThe sage, in loving the people and governing the state, is likewise;\nIn cultivating the self and nourishing life, he is likewise.\nThis concludes the meaning of *\"The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.\"*\n\n**Verse:**\nBottomless, it is called the bellows;\nThree holes, it is called the flute.\nWithin, a single aperture—\nNo one can grasp it.\nIf one could grasp it, he would be lord,\nBlowing forth soundless music.\n\n*\"The valley spirit does not die,\"*\nEmpty and numinous, it does not fade.\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe Mysterious Female’s gate,\nOpening and closing,\nIs called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nIt generates Heaven and generates Earth,\nEnduring ceaselessly, without rest or pause.\nIts use is never forced,\nIts application is inexhaustible.\n\nThese six chapters above:\n*\"The valley spirit does not die\"*—\nEmpty and numinous, it does not fade.\nContinuing the meaning of *\"guarding the center\"* from the previous chapter.\nEmpty and numinous, its transformations are boundless;\nYin and Yang are unfathomable.\nOpening and closing without cease,\nComing and going without end—\nNone know its limit.\nIn movement and stillness, it is without flaw,\nWithout labor or effort,\nGenerating and transforming without end.\n\n**Verse:**\nOpening and closing in accord with Heaven and Earth,\nThis is the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nSince there is no going out or coming in,\nIt alone is honored across the Three Realms.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure without rest or pause.\nThe reason Heaven and Earth can be long and enduring\nIs that they do not live for themselves—\nWithout intent,\nThus they can be long-enduring,\nUnchanging and unshifting.\nTherefore the sage emulates Heaven:\nPlacing himself behind, he finds himself ahead—\nForgetting the self.\nSetting himself aside, he finds himself preserved—\nForgetting form.\nIs it not because he is selfless?\nThus he accomplishes his self.\nBecause he has no self,\nThus he fulfills himself.\n\nThese seven chapters above:\nHeaven does not act as Heaven of itself,\nEarth does not act as Earth of itself—\nThus they generate without cease.\nThe sage does not act as sage of himself—\nThus he harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth.\nThis continues the meaning of *\"Its use is never forced.\"*\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Dao is utterly empty,\nThis emptiness has no beginning.\nWhoever penetrates this emptiness\nBecomes one body with the Great Void.\nThe Tai Lake spans thirty-six thousand acres—\nTo whom would the moon in its waves speak?\n\nThe highest virtue is like water,\nAbiding in lowliness with softness.\nWater benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend,\nAdapting to square or round.\nIt dwells where the multitude disdain,\nAble to embrace the foul and impure—\nThus it nearly approaches the Dao.\nNear, level tone: in accord with the Dao.\nDwelling in good earth,\nBenefiting things.\nThe mind is good when deep,\nReceptive to things.\nIn giving, it is good with kindness,\nGenerating things.\nIn speech, it is good with sincerity,\nResponding to things.\nIn governance, it is good with order,\nTransforming things.\nIn affairs, it is good with ability,\nCompleting things.\nIn action, it is good with timing,\nIn harmony with things.\nOnly because it does not contend,\nThus it is without blame—\nThings and self as one.\n\nThese eight chapters above:\nContinuing the previous chapter’s *\"Placing himself behind, he finds himself ahead.\"*\nThe meaning of water is to take softness, humility, and lowliness,\nBenefiting things without contention—\nThus it is without blame.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithout contention, the spirit is serene,\nNaturally the qi is harmonious.\nLet go of this little thing,\nHow many times has the Yellow River run clear?\n\nTo hold and fill it\nIs not as good as stopping.\nAlready, yǐ tone: to cease.\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the full and benefits the humble.\nTo measure and sharpen it\nCannot be long preserved.\nMeasure, chǔi tone.\nEarth’s Dao transforms the full and flows to the humble.\nGold and jade fill the hall—\nNone can guard them.\nGhosts and spirits harm the full and bless the humble.\nWealth and honor with arrogance\nBring their own misfortune.\nYí, departing tone; jiù, rising tone.\nHuman Dao detests the full and favors the humble.\nWhen merit is achieved and fame is established,\nWithdraw—\nGather and return.\nHeaven’s Dao.\nHeaven and Earth harmonize their virtue.\n\nThese nine chapters above:\n*\"To hold and fill it is not as good as stopping\"* continues the meaning of *\"The highest virtue is like water.\"*\n*\"When merit is achieved and fame is established, withdraw\"* is the warning against fullness and the exhortation to humility.\n\n**Verse:**\nHurrying forward, the shadow does not leave;\nReturning, one falls into the pit.\nJust now, stop where your feet stand—\nThe land becomes level and deep.\nIf you understand turning the body with a little effort,\nHiding or soaring are all at your will.\n\nCarry the hun and po,\nDo not let them wander recklessly.\nEmbrace the One—can you not let it go?\nTwo things mixed in harmony,\nLike a mother carrying her infant.\nConcentrate the qi to attain softness—\nCan you be like an infant?\nPure and undivided,\nReturning to simplicity and wholeness.\nCleanse and purify the mysterious mirror—\nCan you be without flaw?\nNot seeing, not hearing,\nDust-free and mirror-bright.\nLove the people and govern the state—\nCan you act without action?\nZhì tone: to govern.\nUnmoving and unshaken,\nThe Dao flourishes and the times are clear.\nThe gate of Heaven opens and closes—\nCan you be the female?\nGoing out to being, entering to non-being,\nWithout boasting or pride.\nUnderstanding the four directions—\nCan you be without knowledge?\nDiminish cleverness, set aside wisdom,\nHarmonizing light and blending with dust.\nGiving life and nurturing,\nXù, entering tone.\nRevolving the Four Virtues,\nNurturing the multitudes.\nGiving life yet not possessing,\nAchieving merit and fulfilling the Way,\nConcealing traces and hiding form.\nActing yet not relying,\nForgetting its origin,\nSilent and obscure.",

      "translated_text": "Long yet not controlling—\n*Long*, rising tone.\nRetreating to leave room,\nAll entrusted to Heaven’s renewal.\nThis is called the Mysterious Power.\n\nThe Dao ascends, virtue is complete,\nDetached from form, the True is preserved whole.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n\"Bearing the po-soul\"—\nLike a cart bearing goods, the po delights in movement,\nIn galloping, in hardness and sharpness—hence \"bearing the po.\"\nThe po belongs to yin; when yin flourishes, it harms yang.\nWhen emotions prevail, they enslave the nature.\nOnly by embracing the One without parting\nCan one attain softness, flawlessness, non-action,\nFemininity, and non-knowing—\nThus restraining the po’s unruly emotions.\nWhen the po is subdued and yin dissolves,\nThe spirit is serene, the nature still.\n\n\"Giving life and nurturing\"—\nGiving life yet not possessing,\nForgetting its origin—\nNo need for restraint,\nNaturally unmoving,\nLike returning laden with treasures.\nThus, \"bearing the po.\"\nFrom \"embracing the One\" onward,\nAll speaks to the meaning of \"bearing the po,\"\nLinking the previous chapter’s \"achieving merit and withdrawing\"\nTo the following chapter’s \"thirty spokes share one hub,\"\nWhich serves the cart’s function.\n\n**Verse:**\nAffairs resolve when the heart is empty—\nYet emptiness is most difficult.\nIn an instant of awakening,\nAfter delusion, a thousand mountains lie between.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThirty spokes share one hub—\nLike the myriad dharmas uniting in one mind.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the cart—there is no cart.\nThe cart’s use arises when spokes converge at the hub,\nCompleting the cart’s function.\n\nMold clay to make a vessel—\n*Mold*, *shàn*, level tone.\nHarmonizing earth to form a vessel.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the vessel—there is no vessel.\nThe vessel’s use arises from the union of water and earth,\nCompleting the vessel’s function.\n\nCarve doors and windows to make a room—\nOpening doors, hollowing windows.\nWhere it is empty,\nCount the room—there is no room.\nThe room’s use arises when doors and windows allow passage,\nCompleting the room’s function.\n\nThus, being serves to benefit,\nUsing being to aid non-being.\nNon-being serves as the function,\nUsing non-being to employ being.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven (continued)**\nThe hub’s convergence of spokes enables the cart’s use—\nJust as all dharmas return to the mind,\nThe marvel of preserving the spirit whole.\nWithout spokes converging at the hub, how can it be called a cart?\nWithout dharmas returning to the mind, how can the spirit be realized?\nThe hub is empty within, allowing the cart to move;\nThe mind is empty within, allowing the spirit to adapt.\nThus, emptiness becomes the true benefit,\nBeing becomes the function of emptiness.\nEmptiness and being communicate,\nComing and going without obstruction—\nThis is the meaning of \"bearing the po\" from the previous chapter.\nWhen nothing remains to bear,\nHub and spokes are both forgotten,\nThe cart ceases to exist—\nJust as when mind and dharmas are both forgotten,\nThe spirit returns to emptiness.\nVessels and rooms share this principle.\n\n**Verse:**\nA thousand iron walls,\nTen thousand silver mountains.\nTurn the wheel of mechanism,\nAnd pass straight through.\nTo know the path beneath the mountain,\nAsk those who come and go.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nThe five colors blind the eyes—\nEyes dazzled by color.\nThe five sounds deafen the ears—\nEars confused by noise.\nThe five flavors dull the mouth—\nThe mouth deceived by taste.\nRacing and hunting madden the heart—\nThe heart driven by emotion.\nRare goods hinder conduct—\n*Conduct*, falling tone.\nThe mind turned by things.\n\nThus, the sage tends to the belly, not the eyes—\n*Tends*, falling tone.\nThe inner realm does not go out,\nThe outer realm does not enter.\nThus, rejecting that, embracing this—\n*Reject*, *qù*, *qiāng-lǚ* cut.\nWithdrawing sight, returning to hearing.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve (continued)**\nThe previous chapter expounded the function of emptiness—\nWhen its function is empty, one is not dazzled by sounds and colors.\nThus, it is followed by \"the five colors blind the eyes.\"\nColors, sounds, flavors, and things are all root-and-dust.\nAll worldly people are robbed by them,\nOnly the Daoist is not deceived.\nSeeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—\nWithout ritual, do not engage.\nThen the six thieves transform into the six spiritual penetrations.\nThus, rejecting that, embracing this.\n\n**Verse:**\nSeeing color, the spirit is unsteady;\nHearing sound, great harmony is lost.\nYet nothing is overturned—\nWith empty hands, the highest realm is built.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nFavor and disgrace both startle—\nFavor is the precursor of disgrace.\nValuing great trouble as one’s body—\nValuing is the beginning of trouble.\n\nWhat is meant by \"favor and disgrace both startle\"?\nListen closely to what follows.\nFavor is above, disgrace is below—\nFavor is gain.\nThus, gaining it startles as if losing,\nLosing it startles as if gaining.\nThis is called \"favor and disgrace both startle.\"\nSo it is.\n\nWhat is meant by \"valuing great trouble as one’s body\"?\nA question.\nWhy do I have great trouble?\nBecause I have a body—\n*Have*, falling tone, same below.\nWith a body comes trouble.\nWhen I am without a body—\nForgetting form, free from burdens—\nWhat trouble could I have?\nForgetting honor, free from trouble.\n\nThus, one who values the body for the world—\nThose who set the body aside,\nThose who value the body—\nCan be entrusted with the world.\nOne who loves the body for the world—\nThose who put the body last,\nThose who cherish the body—\nCan be relied upon with the world.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen (continued)**\nFollowing the previous chapter’s \"tending to the belly, not the eyes,\"\nThe meaning of forgetting the self.\nThus, it is followed by \"favor and disgrace both startle.\"\nFavor, disgrace, honor, and trouble are mutually dependent.\nIf one can anticipate trouble and guard against it,\nThere will be no trouble for a lifetime.\nExtending this Dao to govern and pacify the world,\nThe world will forever be free from peril.\nThose who rule a state and worry for the world as for their own bodies\nWill have the world willingly embrace them without weariness.\n\n**Verse:**\nWhat disgrace is there in disgrace?\nWhat honor is there in honor?\nGuarding against faults in advance\nIs still like traveling a path.\nHow much better to lay down the whole body,\nWithout gain or loss, without startling.\n\n---\n\nInvisible, it is called *yí*—\nThe great image has no form.\nInaudible, it is called *xī*—\nThe great sound is soundless.\nIntangible, it is called *wēi*—\nThe Dao is hidden, without name.\nThese three cannot be further questioned—\nHow could they be explained?\nThus, they merge into one.\nDifferent paths, same return.\n\nAbove, it is not bright—\nNothing is more hidden than the obscure.\nBelow, it is not dark—\nNothing is more manifest than the subtle.\nEndless, it cannot be

winter,\nChill piercing to the bone.\nWary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides—\nVigilant in solitude.\nSolemn, as if ice about to melt—\nWithout doubt.\nSimple, as if uncarved wood—\n*Pǔ* (like one dull of wit).\nVast, as if an empty valley—\nHollow within.\nTurbid, as if muddied waters—\n*Hún* (read in level tone),\nOne with the dust.\n\nWho can stir the turbid to slowly clarify?\nClarity is the source of turbidity.\nWho can remain still to slowly quicken?\nStillness is the mechanism of movement.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness—\nEmptiness is the root of fulfillment.\nOnly by not being full,\nCan one be empty and receptive.\nThus, the worn does not become new—\nBurying brilliance, leveling ornament.\n\n**Right Chapter Fifteen:**\nContinuing the meaning of the Dao’s discipline from the previous chapter.\nIlluminating for later learners:\nPreserve sincerity, cultivate reverence,\nAlways be vigilant in solitude,\nDo not cling to appearances but embrace the One,\nAnd abide in emptiness in daily practice.\nWhen all conditions suddenly cease,\nAnd the myriad illusions melt away—\nStir it, and it does not become turbid;\nSettle it, and it does not become clear.\nThis is called \"subtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating\"—\nDeeply hidden.\n\n**Verse:**\nSubtle, wondrous, profoundly penetrating,\nTurning with the tread of men.\nBlindfold the eyes,\nAnd nothing is seen.\nBetter to return—\nRecognize the face of the Void Sovereign.\n\nAttain utmost emptiness,\nGuard deep stillness.\nMotionless and serene—\nYet the ten thousand things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\nObserving return, one knows transformation.\n\nThe things, teeming and diverse,\nEach returns to its root—\nMovement at its extreme reverts to stillness.\nReturning to the root is called stillness,\nReturning to the source.\nThis is called \"restoring life’s mandate\"—\nThe vitality of life resides here.\nRestoring life’s mandate is called constancy—\nAbiding thus through kalpas.\nKnowing constancy is called illumination—\nLucid through past and present.\n\nNot knowing constancy—\nDeluded and confused.\nActing recklessly brings misfortune—\nA grievous error.\nKnowing constancy, one is all-embracing—\nGreatness admits no exclusion.\nEmbracing, one is impartial—\nImpartiality is kingly.\nImpartial, one transforms all things—\nKingly, one accords with Heaven.\nAccord with Heaven, one accords with the Dao—\nHow could there be an end or limit?\nThe Dao is enduring—\nInexhaustible.\nThough the body perishes, it does not cease—\nThough heaven and earth change, this does not change.\n\n**Right Chapter Sixteen:**\nContinuing from the previous chapter’s \"adept as scholars.\"\nAttaining emptiness and deep stillness,\nRestoring life’s mandate and returning to the root—\nAll is wondrous and divine,\nAll converge here with discerning eyes.\nThe work of learning is complete.\nIf not yet so, delve further into the final lines.\n\n**Verse:**\nAttain emptiness to know the wondrous root,\nIn deepest stillness, see the heart of Heaven.\nGrasp the meaning within,\nAnd all the sands of the river are gold.\n\nThe Highest—\nNo height surpasses it.\nBelow, people merely know of its existence—\nAll acknowledge its presence.\nNext are those who draw near and praise it—\nTo be near and praised is not natural.\nNext are those who fear it—\nAware of its awe and reverence.\nNext are those who insult it—\nUtterly without restraint.\n\nWhen trust is insufficient, the Dao is hard to believe—\nSome do not trust.\nDoubt runs deep.\nThus, it treasures its words—\nLight promises, few fulfillments.\n\nWhen merit is accomplished and fame achieved,\nSilently it is brought to fruition—\nThe hundred clans all deem it their own nature,\nUnaware of its origin.\n\n**Right Chapter Seventeen:**\n\"The Highest\" means no height surpasses it.\nThough even the lowest know of this principle,\nThey may draw near—\nYet praise renders it unnatural.\nThose who fear it are but a step removed,\nWhile those who insult it have strayed far from the Dao.\nHeavenly truth is lost,\nUnable to return to the source—\nThough taught, what benefit is there?\nThe more words, the less trust.\nBetter to remain silent and await it,\nAct without contrivance and transform,\nAllowing them to awaken on their own,\nNaturally returning to simplicity—\nUnspoken, yet trusted.\n\nIn terms of governance:\nBelow the Highest, none can act without contrivance.\nDrawing near and praising—\nThis is teaching with words.\nThose who fear it—\nThis is the restraint of punishment.\nThose who insult it—\nThe ruler has lost trust.\nWhen the ruler loses trust in the people,\nThe people do not trust in return.\nThus, it treasures its words—\nTeaching without words.\nTeaching without words,\nAccomplishing without contrivance—\nPunishment is unused, yet the people submit.\nWhen merit and fame are achieved,\nAnd simplicity is restored,\nNearness, praise, fear, and insult are all forgotten.\nThe hundred clans live in peace, delighting in custom,\nForgetting their origin—\nThus, they say, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nThe Highest has no height above,\nYet abides in daily use.\nPity the blind fools,\nWho claim it emerged from the Han Pass.\n\nWhen the great Dao declines, there is benevolence and righteousness—\nOnce the great simplicity scatters, benevolence and righteousness arise.\nWhen wisdom and cleverness emerge, there is great deceit—\n*Chū* (read in departing tone):\nWisdom and intelligence—\nRooted in the dust of the senses and karmic consciousness.\nWhen the six relations are not harmonious, there are filial children—\nBetter to abide in constant harmony.\nWhen the state is dark and chaotic, there are loyal ministers—\nBetter to abide in constant order.\n\n**Right Chapter Eighteen:**\nContinuing the meaning of nearness, praise, fear, and insult from the previous chapter.\nRather than a chaotic state revealing loyal ministers,\nWhy not act without contrivance so the people transform themselves?\n\n**Verse:**\nCleverness obscures the great root,\nWisdom loses heavenly truth.\nWithout affairs, abide in constant clarity—\nCarefree and joyful.\n\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom—\nAct without contrivance.\nThe people’s benefit is a hundredfold—\nAt peace and still.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness—\nAct without intent.\nThe people return to filial piety and compassion—\nHarmonious and compliant.\nAbandon skill, discard profit—\nAct without desire.\nThere are no thieves or bandits—\nContentment is constant.",

      "translated_text": "Chapter Twenty-Seven: Exhausting the Essence of the Preceding Chapters\n\nIn speech and action, be meticulous—then no trace remains, no blame accrues. The mind’s calculations cannot be reckoned; the mind’s closures cannot be opened; the mind’s knots cannot be untied. When the mind of Dao stands firm like this, there is no division between good and ungood. Teacher and resource are both forgotten; wisdom is set aside, and one remains all day like a fool.\n\n**Verse:**\nSteps need not depend on feet—\na skillful knot requires no thousand hands.\nTouch the tip of your nose,\nand the whole body becomes a mouth.\nIf you can thoroughly ponder this,\nthe forty-nine arise from the seven-sevens.\n\nKnow the masculine, yet guard the feminine—\ndo not exalt yourself.\nBecome the world’s stream,\nwhere all tributaries return to the source.\nBecome the world’s stream,\nand constant virtue never departs,\nforged into one unbroken whole—\nreturning to the state of an infant,\nwhere qi is complete.\n\nKnow the bright, yet guard the dark—\ndo not display yourself.\nBecome the world’s model,\nwhere all dharmas return to the One.\nBecome the world’s model,\nand constant virtue never errs,\nits standard unwavering—\nreturning to the boundless,\nwhere spirit is complete.\n\nKnow glory, yet guard disgrace—\ndo not prize yourself.\nBecome the world’s valley,\nwhere all existence returns to emptiness.\nBecome the world’s valley,\nand constant virtue is fulfilled,\nprofound and perfectly round—\nreturning to the uncarved block.\n*(Pronounced \"pǔ.\")*\nWhere nature is complete.\nWhen the uncarved block scatters, it becomes vessels,\napplied to things.\nThe sage employs it\nto establish officials and teach the people—\nthus the great system remains uncut,\na teaching without words.\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight: Guarding the Feminine, the Dark, and Disgrace\n\nNot seeing one’s own clarity connects to the preceding chapter’s \"though wise, this is great delusion.\" The infant, the Great Ultimate, the uncarved block—these are the great roots of the world. Only by guarding the feminine and embracing the One can one return to the source. Govern a state with this, and without need for restraint, the people naturally become pure, and things naturally return to simplicity.\n\n**Verse:**\nWithin white, the black is preserved;\nwithin the masculine, the One Feminine is embraced.\nUnbroken, the work continues—\neven men can learn to nurture the infant.\n\nThose who would seize the world and act upon it are mistaken.\nI see they cannot but fail.\nTo wield power against bandits is fitting;\nto become a bandit is not.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nWhere action stirs, misfortune arises.\nThose who act destroy it,\ngrasping what is not theirs, clinging to what is.\nThose who seize lose it,\nseeking advantage, only to fall into it.\nAll things bear form—\nsome lead, some follow;\nsome warm, some chill;\nsome strengthen, some weaken;\nsome uphold, some cast down.\nWhere this exists, that arises—\nbeware of following it.\n\nThus the sage eliminates extremes,\n*(Pronounced \"qù.\")*\nnon-action.\nEliminates excess,\nnon-desire.\nEliminates extravagance,\nnon-attachment.\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine: Non-Action and the Perils of Force\n\nNon-action means no trouble; action invites trouble. Those who seize lose; those who act fail—this is the warning against force. Strength and weakness, upholding and casting down, depend on one another like shadow following form. Where there is success, there is failure. Thus the sage eliminates greed, excess, and arrogance, deeply warning later generations.\n\n**Verse:**\nLeading and following, warming and chilling,\nstrengthening and weakening, upholding and casting down—\nwho is the master in their midst?\nIt is no one.\nDressing and eating are ordinary matters—\nwhy trouble yourself with needless doubt?\n\nThose who assist a ruler with the Dao do so through non-action.\nDo not seek to strengthen the world with arms,\nbut defend it with compassion.\nSuch deeds swiftly return—\n*(Pronounced \"xuán.\")*\ngood and evil alike bear fruit.\nWhere armies encamp,\nthorns and brambles grow.\nWhere the mind’s troops arise,\nthe sacred ground lies barren.\nAfter great armies pass,\nyears of famine follow.\nWhere demonic forces gallop,\nessence and qi are depleted.\n\nThus the good accomplish their ends and stop—\n*(Pronounced \"yǐ.\")*\nwhere there is decisiveness, life arises.\nThey dare not seize strength,\nbut meet force with softness.\nAccomplishing without boasting—\neliminating extremes.\nAccomplishing without flaunting—\neliminating excess.\nAccomplishing without arrogance—\neliminating extravagance.\nAccomplishing only when unavoidable—\neven in hardship, this is the way.\nThus they accomplish without forcing—\nlowering the banner of the sword.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age;\nwhen arms grow strong, they do not prevail.\nThis is called \"not-Dao\"—\na mistake.\nThose who depart from the Dao perish early,\nforever losing the true Way.\n\nChapter Thirty: Assisting Rulers with the Dao\n\nContinuing the preceding chapter’s elimination of excess and extravagance: those who assist rulers with the Dao do not exalt military might. Good and evil alike bear fruit—this warns those who govern states and families to guard the feminine, embrace the One, and be brave in their restraint. Even when unavoidable, they dare not seize strength, thus it is said: \"The good accomplish their ends and stop.\"\n\n**Verse:**\nDo not let the three minds run wild—\nlet the will always lead the intent.\nSuddenly, if forced into battle,\none arrow settles Mount Tian.\n\nFine weapons are inauspicious tools.\nAfter great armies pass, years of famine follow.\nSome may detest them—\n*(Pronounced \"wù.\")*\nwhere armies encamp, thorns and brambles grow.\nThus those who embody the Dao do not dwell there.\n*(Pronounced \"chǔ.\")*\nWhere the mind’s troops do not arise.\n\nThe noble person at rest values the left,\nembracing softness.\nIn war, they value the right,\nembracing hardness.\nWeapons are inauspicious tools,\nused to suppress rebellion—\nnot the tools of the noble person,\nwho constantly governs.\nOnly when unavoidable are they used,\nwith tranquility as the highest aim,\ndefending with compassion.\nVictory is not glorified—\nto do so is to seek merit.\nThis is delighting in killing.\n*(Pronounced \"yuè.\")*\nIndulging in hardness and bravery.\nThose who delight in killing\nplant the seeds of misfortune—\nthey cannot prevail in the world,\nfor the Creator does not tolerate them.\n\nAuspicious affairs value the left,\nembracing life.\nInauspicious affairs value the right,\nembracing death.\nThe deputy general stands on the left,\nvaluing softness.\nThe supreme general stands on the right,\nvaluing hardness.\nThis is to handle them with mourning rites—\ninauspicious tools.\nWhen many are killed,\nit is unavoidable—\nmourn them with sorrow and tears.\n*(One says: compassion.)*\nWhen victorious in battle,\nhandle it with mourning rites,\nas if grieving for parents.\n\nChapter Thirty-One: Weapons as Inauspicious Tools\n\nNot seeking to strengthen the world with arms, the text follows with \"weapons are inauspicious tools,\" deeply warning the sage about this.",

      "translated_text": "「With its profound nurturing of life,\nAnger and desire do not cease,\nGreed for life is insatiable.\nIt is said that those who skillfully guard life\nHave no anger or desire.\n\nTraveling by land, they meet no tigers or rhinoceroses—\n*兕* (*rì*, rhinoceros).\nIn self-reflection, they feel no guilt,\nSo what need for worry or fear?\nEntering battle, they are not harmed by armor or weapons,\nTheir hearts unobstructed, so no dread exists.\nThe rhinoceros has no place to lodge its horn,\nThe tiger no place to set its claws,\nWeapons no place to hold their blades.\nIf one does not cling to life,\nHow could there be death?\nWhy so?\nThe body is not mine to possess,\nDeath cannot harm me—\nFor I dwell in the realm of no-death.\n\nForgetting birth and death,\nThus the right fifty-first chapter:\nThe gentle and weak are those who guard life,\nThe strong and mighty are those who perish.\nThe gentle and weak can curb anger and desire,\nWhile the strong and mighty are enslaved by them.\nTo curb anger, fire descends and is extinguished,\nTo restrain desire, water rises and is contained.\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, life is sustained—\nHence they are called *those who guard life*.\nAnger stirs the fire of ignorance,\nDesire churns like ocean waves,\nWhen water and fire clash, death ensues—\nHence they are called *those who perish*.\nThe strong and mighty greed for life without limit,\nThe gentle and weak regard death as returning home,\nFor they do not see death as death,\nSo what harm can tigers, rhinoceroses, armor, or weapons do to them?\n\nIn terms of the *Dan Dao* (Alchemical Dao),\nWhen water and fire are harmonized, the *saintly embryo* (聖胎) congeals.\nThe ode says:\n*Nirvana* (涅盘) is easy to grasp in the heart,\nBut discriminative wisdom is hard to discern.\nWithout discriminative wisdom,\nHow could there be death or life?\nThe *Dao* gives birth,\nThe *Yuan Shi* (元始) is the primal *qi* (祖气).\nThe *virtue/power* (德) nurtures it—\n*Nurture* (畜), pronounced *xiù* (凶入声).\nIt transforms and gives birth to all the *Realms of Existence* (诸天).\nIt shapes all things—\nIn the heavens, it forms *images* (象).\nBy *effort* (势), it shapes forms on earth.\nThus all things, with their myriad forms,\nDo not fail to honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.\nAll arise from the Dao,\nThe Dao’s grandeur, virtue’s nobility—\nExceeding the ancients, surpassing the present.\n\nNone know their rank yet remain ever natural,\nThey do not speak of goodness in response.\nThus the Dao gives birth, nurtures, and preserves—\n*Qi* (神) is complete.\nIt grows and fosters—\n*Qi* (气) is complete.\nIt matures and perfects—\n*Essence* (精) is complete.\nIt nourishes and shelters—\nForm is complete.\nLife is given yet not possessed,\nForgetting the *mechanisms* (机).\nAction is taken yet not relied upon,\nForgetting the *affections* (情).\nIt grows yet is never slaughtered,\nForgetting all things—\nThis is called *mysterious virtue/power* (玄德),\nIn harmony with the Dao.\n\nThus the right fifty-first chapter:\nThose who skillfully guard life\nKnow the realm of no-death,\nHence they follow with the words of *Dao-giving-birth*.\nThe Dao is formless,\nYet through giving birth to the heavens and earth, its form becomes visible.\nThe Dao is nameless,\nYet through fostering all things, its name can be established.\nAll things with their forms\nReceive their mandate from the heavens,\nTake shape from the earth,\nDraw *qi* from the *Central Harmony* (中和),\nAll are the Dao’s manifestations—\nThus all things honor the Dao and cherish virtue/power.\n\nThe ode says:\n*The Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao*,\n*The Way of non-action yet has action*.\nI clearly explain it for you,\nYet all waters flow westward.\nThe night arrives, and the *chaos* (混沌) is plucked from the earth,\nAll forms and patterns remain unknown.\nThe world has a beginning,\nNameless—\nThe beginning of the heavens and earth.\nThey call it the *mother of the world*.\nWith a name—\nThe *mother of all things*.\nKnowing its mother,\nKnowing the root—\nKnowing its root,\nIts children reveal its end.\nKnowing its children,\nKnowing its future—\nReturning to its mother,\nAttaining the root—\nThe body remains unharmed,\nEver present.\nSeal its *joy* (兑),\nThe inner realm does not escape.\nClose its *gate* (门),\nThe outer realm does not enter.\nA lifetime without exertion—\nNot laboring yet governing.\nOpen its joy,\nThe inner realm emerges,\nAccomplishing its affairs—\nThe outer realm enters.\nA

people grow ever poorer.\nThe delusions of desire for gain.\n\nThe people hoard many tools of profit,\nAnd the state becomes ever more corrupt.\nThe dazzle of rare commodities.\n\nMen indulge in cunning arts,\nAnd strange objects proliferate.\nThe shift toward superficial tricks.\n\nLaws and decrees grow ever more explicit,\nAnd thieves and robbers abound.\nLaw begets deceit from above.\nThus, the sage says:\n*\"I act without doing, yet the people transform themselves;\nI do not prize schemes and stratagems.\nI cherish stillness, yet the people align themselves;\nI do not use tools of profit.\nI act without affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI do not honor rare commodities.\nI have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.*\nSimplicity—*pǔ* [朴], pronounced *chú-bó* [蒲卜].\nTo govern with rectitude.\n\n**Chapter 58:**\nThe previous chapter spoke of *non-speech by the wise*,\nAnd thus attained its rectitude.\nHence, I follow with *governing with rectitude*.\n\nTaboos abound, tools of profit abound,\nCunning arts abound, laws and decrees abound—\nAll these are not rectitude.\nWhen the ruler has no taboos, the people thrive;\nCutting off schemes and stratagems, the people transform themselves;\nLightening taxes and levies, the people grow wealthy;\nGuiding them with virtue, the people return to simplicity.\nActing without doing, without affairs,\nWithout desire, cherishing stillness—\nAll these are rectitude.\nGovern with this, and the seas will be calm, the rivers clear;\nPractice the Dao with this, and the Dao will flourish, the times prosper;\nCultivate oneself with this, and the *qi* will solidify, the spirit congeal.\nOne person rectified, ten thousand people rectified;\nOne heart rectified, ten thousand transformations rectified;\nOne self rectified, ten thousand affairs rectified.\nGreat is the power of rectitude!\nThe verse says:\n*\"Fixing one’s mind brings endless error,\nNon-action again falls void.\nSince the heart’s path is severed,\nEvery day is spring breeze.\nHis governance is tranquil and broad,\nTranquil as the gate’s closing.\nNon-action brings ease and abundance.\nHis people are pure and sincere,\nSimple and unadorned, with virtue overflowing.\nHis governance is keen and strict,\nWith action, stern and precise.\nHis people are hollow and greedy,\nHollow as *quē* [缺], pronounced *yà* [轧].\nAvid and insatiable, their ruin is near.\nDisaster, disaster!—\nFortune depends upon it.\nFear disaster, and fortune will surely come.\nFortune, fortune!—\nDisaster lies hidden within.\nNeglect fortune, and disaster will surely arise.\nWho knows its limits?\nDisaster and fortune have no gates—\nOnly people invite them by themselves.\nIs it not rectitude that is lacking?\nOnly rectitude can be upheld.\nRectitude becomes strange,\nRelying on rectitude makes it strange.\nGoodness becomes demonic,\nPride in goodness makes it demonic.\nThe people’s confusion opposes the Dao,\nAnd their error grows with time.\nTheir confusion becomes distant and never returns.\nThus, the sage is square yet does not cut,\nSquare in his rectitude, letting his heart transform itself.\nModest yet not defiled,\nPure in his virtue, letting the people transform themselves.\nUpright yet not unrestrained,\nFirm in his conduct, letting things transform themselves.\nBright yet not blinding,\nHolding and nurturing his light, the world transforms itself.*\n\n**Chapter 59:**\nThe previous chapter continued the meaning of *governing with tranquil breadth*.\nIn governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.\nSpeaking of the state, it means lightening punishments and levies, reducing taxes;\nSpeaking of the self, it means moderating speech and actions, regulating drink and food;\nSpeaking of the heart, it means lightening thought and worry, severing sight and hearing.\nExhausting one’s heart, nurturing one’s nature—\nThis is how one serves Heaven.\nThe verse says:\n*\"To live is to govern affairs, to govern affairs is to live;\nTo lighten affairs is to lighten living, to sever affairs is to sever life’s threads.\nClouds linger at the ridge’s peak, idle yet never fully clear,\nWater flows through the ravine’s depths, ever too busy to rest.\nTo govern a great state, as to poach a small fish—\nDisturb it, and it will fall apart.\nWith the Dao to rule the world, if one disturbs it, chaos follows.\nPoach it, and it will spoil.\nThe ghosts are not numinous,\nThe yin-demons bow their heads.\nNot that the ghosts are not numinous,\nBut that their numinosity does not harm people.\nEvil does not intrude upon rectitude.\nNot that their numinosity does not harm people,\nFor the sage also does not harm people.\nGreat measures do not cut.\nWhen the two do not harm each other, form and spirit both attain perfection.\nThus, virtue returns to its source, and the Dao resonates in harmony.\"*\n\n**Chapter 60:**\nTo

      "translated_text": "The easy is not lightly shown,\nFor lightly shown, men neglect it—\nThus the sage regards it as difficult.\n\nWhat is gained with difficulty is lost with difficulty,\nAnd only what is not lightly taken will endure without trial.\n\n*Ode:*\nTo speak of ease is not ease,\nTo speak of difficulty is not difficulty.\nWithin its subtlety lies its marvel—\nThe North Star gazing southward.\n\nWhat is secure is easily held.\n*Ease, with falling tone.*\n*As below.*\n\nReside in ease yet fear danger.\nWhat is yet unseen is easily planned—\nAct, and plan at the beginning.\nWhat is fragile is easily broken—\nPlan difficulty from ease.\nWhat is subtle is easily dispersed—\nPlan greatness from the minute.\nAct before it exists,\nPrevent disaster before it arises.\nOrder before chaos,\nOrder before existence.\n\nA tree in arms’ embrace grows from a hair’s end—\nFrom the subtle to the manifest.\nA nine-tiered tower rises from a clod of earth—\nAccumulating small to great.\nA thousand-li journey begins beneath one’s feet—\nFrom near to far.\n\nThe doer undoes it—\nVigilance lies in the beginning.\nThe grasper loses it—\nVigilance ensures no loss.\n\nThus the sage, with no action, meets no defeat,\nWith no grasping, meets no loss.\nHolding fast yet never abandoning—\nTherefore, when the people act,\nThey have something to apply.\nYet often near completion, they fail,\nNot vigilant at the start—\nHow then can there be an end?\n\nTo treat the end as the beginning,\nThen no task shall fail.\nThe original heart unclouded—\nHow then can there be failure?\n\nThus the sage desires not to desire,\nDesires that others not desire.\nDoes not prize hard-won goods—\nTransforming things.\nTeaches those who do not learn,\nCorrecting the errors of the many—\nShifting virtue.\nAids the natural unfolding of all things,\nYet dares not act.\nThe wise fear the law.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Four*\nContinuing the meaning above:\nWhat is secure is easily held—\nSpeaking of planning at the start,\nCultivated minds correct the heart before thought,\nRestrain emotion before encountering things,\nThen the heart is easily rectified,\nEmotion easily severed.\n\nIf governance comes after chaos,\nIf disaster is warded off after its sprouting—\nIs this not difficult?\nAccumulating small to great—\nOnce lost, it cannot be reclaimed.\nThus the *Yijing* warns: *Tread on frost, expect solid ice.*\nThe *Commentary* says:\n*A minister kills his lord, a son kills his father—*\nNot the work of a single morning or evening,\nBut a gradual descent,\nFrom failing to discern early enough.\nThe *Strike* says:\n*Evil not accumulated cannot destroy life.*\nAgain it says:\n*Evil accumulated cannot be undone.*\nHow can one not be warned?\n\nIf one awakens only after deviation,\nAnd with earnest effort returns—\nStill, it is not as good as resolving before form takes shape,\nWithout labor, restored.\nThus it is said:\n*The subtle is easily dispersed,*\n*The unseen is easily planned.*\n\nAgain it says:\n*The doer undoes,*\n*The grasper loses.*\nThe warning is yet more urgent.\n\nThe sage teaches those who do not learn,\nDesires that others not desire,\nWith no grasping, no action,\nConsistent from beginning to end,\nForever without peril.\n\nIf one attains this understanding,\nVigilant at the start—\nHow then can there be failure or loss?\n\nBefore a thing sprouts,\nAll signs appear—\nKnow it, and do not act;\nAct, and do not lose.\n\nOnly the Precious Nine—\nExhausting this Way—\nCould it be only Yanzi?\n\n*Ode:*\n*A hair’s deviation, a thousand-li’s loss.*\nRush back swiftly, yet still second.\nPressing the horse late to rein,\nThe boat at the river’s heart, mending too late.\n\nThe ancient skilled ruler\nDid not enlighten the people—\nNot knowing, not knowing.\nHe would deceive them.\nHis governance was dim.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nFor their cleverness is too much.\nHis governance was sharp.\nTo rule with cleverness is the state’s ruin;\nTo guide with cleverness leaves the people insufficient.\nNot to rule with cleverness is the state’s blessing;\nTo guide with virtue leaves the people with abundance.\nThese two are the standards.\n*Standard, pronounced as \"kǎi\" (口骇切).*\nWidely inclusive, yet lawful—no people.\nAlways knowing the standard,\nAbandoning the short for the long.\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue.*\nIn accord with the Way.\nMysterious Virtue is profound and distant,\nThe more one explores, the deeper it grows,\nThe more one seeks, the farther it stretches.\nIt reverses with things,\nNot consorting with all laws.\nOnly then does it reach the Great Harmony.\nGoing counter, yet aligning with transformation.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Five*\nWhat is secure is easily held—\nThe swift return to goodness.\nThus the next best ruler\nDoes not enlighten the people.\nSpeaking of no-action’s breadth,\nPeacefully governing the world—\nThe people’s blessing.\nWith action’s strictness,\nDominating the people—\nThe state’s ruin.\nThe people are hard to govern,\nFor they are too involved in affairs.\nThus the sage governs with no-action’s clarity and stillness,\nSo that the wise dare not act.\nThough contrary to things,\nLong accustomed to nature,\nThe people thrive, reaping a hundredfold blessings,\nThe world harmonized, achieving Great Harmony’s transformation.\nExhausting this Way—\nThis is called *Mysterious Virtue.*\n\n*Ode:*\nAll conditioned things,\nThree thousand six hundred gates.\nExamined from the start,\nAll are but distractions of the spirit.\nOnly I embrace the nameless Primordial,\nEndless demons bow in surrender.\nThe sea and rivers rule all valleys\nBecause they are lowly.\nWith their skill in descending,\nGreat states flow downward—\nThus they rule all valleys.\nDifferent paths, same return.\nTherefore the sage, desiring to lead the people,\nSpeaks to them in humility.\nDesiring to precede the people,\nHe places himself behind.\nSelf-mastery.\nThus the sage, though above, does not burden the people—\nThe people forget their labor.\nThough before them, he does not harm the people—\nThe people forget their deaths.\nThus the world willingly follows without tiring.\n*Follow, pronounced as \"lè\" (音洛).*\nWith virtue, hearts are truly served.\nBecause he does not contend—\nHumility and yielding—\nThus none under heaven can contend with him.\nThe world is at peace.\n\n*Chapter Sixty-Six*\nThe skilled ruler humbles himself to tend his own nature,\nThus next, likening himself to the sea ruling all valleys—\nThe meaning of *Supreme Goodness as Water.*\nSpeaking to the people in humility,\nThe people forget their labor;",

it.\n\nOnly the great has no equal—\nThus seeming unworthy.\nSeeming what?\nIf worthy for long, it is trifling.\nOnce comparable, it is not great.\n\nI possess three treasures, worthless in exchange:\nGuard them carefully:\nFirst, *cì*—compassion, benevolence.\nSecond, *jiǎn*—frugality, moderation.\nThird, not daring to lead the world—\nHumility, withdrawal.\n\n*Cì* makes one courageous—\nNothing is unconquered.\n*Jiǎn* makes one expansive—\nNothing is lacking.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nThus one fulfills his role as vessel and leader—\nNone resist.\n\nNow abandoning *cì* and courage—\nIt is harshness and violence.\nAbandoning *jiǎn* and expansiveness—\nIt is greed and desire.\nAbandoning withdrawal for precedence—\nIt is tyranny and force.\nDeath.\nThe followers

forbearance, humility, and withdrawal encompass the greatest vastness.\n\nThe single character *cì*—\nIn war, it conquers;\nIn defense, it is unshaken.\nThe benevolent have no rival—\nTrue

the ruler are not good,\nAnd the people have lost their sustenance.\n\nWhen the people lose their sustenance,\nThey seek to fulfill their lives,\nAnd thus do not fear death.\n\nMoreover, if the ruler adds harsh punishments and prohibitions,\nForcing the people to fear death,\nThen this is driving the people to their own doom.\n\nExhausting the law leaves no people—\nThis is what Heaven abhors,\nAnd thus the Sage does not tolerate it either.\n\n*\"Constantly there are those who wield the blade\"*—\nThis means Heaven cannot be deceived.\n\n*\"He who substitutes for the executioner\"*—\nThis refers to those who hold the authority of punishment.\n\n*\"A carpenter’s apprentice wielding the adze\"*—\nThis is improper.\n\n*\"Few escape unharmed\"*—\nThis speaks of the extreme of punishment,\nWhich harms the harmony of the people.\n\nThe Sage warns against this and cautions against excessive punishment.\n\n**Ode:**\nThe void is silent, yet walls have ears.\n\nAsk how to act, and strike the chest immediately.\n\nThe Great Earth’s order is just—\nA long sword leaning on Heaven chills men to the bone.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from scarcity and famine—\nBecause their ruler’s taxes and exactions are too heavy,\nGreed leads to famine, and excessive desires bring chaos.\nThus, they hunger, and it is always insufficient.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance comes from disorder and confusion—\nBecause their ruler’s actions are too contrived,\nExcessive affairs lead to chaos.\nThus, they are hard to govern, and it is always unstable.\n\nThe people’s disregard for death comes from forgetting their fate—\nBecause their pursuit of life is excessive,\nGreed knows no bounds.\nThus, they dare to defy death,\nUnmindful of peril and ruin.\n\nOnly he who does not cling to life,\nWho does not indulge in it,\nIs wiser than those who prize life.\nHe does not cling to life himself,\nAnd thus attains lasting life.\n\n**Chapter 75 (Continuing the theme of the people not fearing death):**\nThe people’s hunger, their difficulty in governance,\nArises from improper governance and moral cultivation—\nThe people do not fulfill their lives,\nAnd thus cling to life while unmindful of peril and ruin.\n\nGovern them with the law and they will rebel;\nGovern them with virtue and they will submit.\nIf the ruler cherishes tranquility,\nThe people will find joy and follow his transformation.\n\n**Ode:**\nWisdom is but filth,\nCunning is but dust.\nDetach even the slightest thought,\nAnd the nature of the boundless sea clarifies itself.\n\nThe people’s life is soft and weak—\nA single mass of harmonious *qi*.\nTheir death is hard and strong—\nThe harmonious *qi* disperses.\nAll things, grasses, and trees in their life are soft and tender,\nWith harmonious *qi* intact.\nIn their death, they wither and dry—\nThe harmonious *qi* is gone.\nThus, the hard and strong are those who die,\nFor rigidity and violence are the roots of self-destruction.\nThe soft and weak are those who live,\nFor gentleness and harmony are the keys to nurturing life.\nTherefore, strong arms do not conquer,\nRelying on strength leads to defeat.\nStrong wood bends,\nAnd strong wood snaps.\nStrength in excess brings ruin—\nThe root of sinking low.\nWeakness in moderation brings elevation—\nThe symbol of rising high.\n\n**Chapter 76 (Continuing the theme):**\nWhen the ruler’s governance and moral cultivation are not good,\nAnd harm the harmonious *qi*,\nThen the world is filled with rigidity and violence.\n\nBy practicing non-action in purity and simplicity,\nAnd refining oneself,\nOne can restore the harmonious *qi*—\nThe people fulfill their lives,\nFind joy in their work,\nAnd without testing punishments, all are content and obedient.\nHow could there still be rigidity and violence?\n\nThus, cultivating order and governing peace\nAll depend on gentleness and harmony.\n\nSpeaking in terms of the Daoist *elixir* (丹道),\nWhen harmonious *qi* remains,\nWater and fire support each other;\nWhen harmonious *qi* disperses,\nWater and fire oppose each other—\nThus, weakness in moderation is elevated.\n\n**Ode:**\nSoftness and weakness are not good,\nHardness and strength are not evil.\nBetter to nurture the Great Harmony,\nAnd dwell in perpetual ease and joy.\n\nIs not Heaven’s Dao like drawing a bow?\nBalancing and applying force to things.\nThe high are lowered,\nThe low are raised.\nThe abundant are diminished,\nThe lacking are supplemented.\nThe many are reduced,\nThe few are increased.\n\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the abundant to supplement the lacking,\nAnd takes from the full to give to the modest.\nBut man’s Dao is the opposite—\nHe takes from the lacking to serve the abundant,\nAnd harms others to benefit himself.\nWho can give their abundance to serve the world?\nWho can harm themselves to benefit others?\nOnly the Daoist can.\n\nThe Sage acts without relying on it,\nAnd diminishes.\nThe Sage accomplishes without taking credit,\nAnd diminishes.\nHe does not wish to be seen as virtuous—\n*\"Seen\"* (見) pronounced *xiàn*.\nDiminish even the diminished.",
