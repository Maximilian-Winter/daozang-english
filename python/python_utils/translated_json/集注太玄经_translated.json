I had only observed Yangzi’s *Self-Preface*, which praised the *Taixuan Jing* highly.\n\nLater, when Ban Gu wrote his *Transmission*, he said: Liu Xin once observed the *Taixuan Jing* and told Yang Xiong, “You have only labored in vain.” Today’s scholars seek wealth and profit, yet they still cannot fully grasp the *Yijing*, so what can they do with the *Taixuan Jing*? I fear that future generations will treat it like an overturned jar of fermented soybeans. Xiong laughed but did not respond.\n\nSome scholars criticized this, saying that since Xiong was not a sage, his composing a classic was like the rulers of Wu and Chu in the Spring and Autumn period, who usurped the title of king—an offense deserving of extermination. Gu preserved these words, and though his intent surpassed that of Xin, he did not acknowledge the *Taixuan Jing* as being as excellent as Yangzi claimed.\n\nI too privately wondered why Yangzi did not endorse the *Yijing* but instead created the *Taixuan Jing*. The *Yijing* exhaustively encompasses the principles of Heaven and humanity. How could Yangzi surpass it, yet compose another book? Moreover, I did not know its purpose, so I also did not believe Yangzi was suited to author the *Taixuan Jing*.\n\nLater, as I studied the *Yijing*, I found its profundity and obscurity difficult to grasp. I thought the *Taixuan Jing* must be a work by a virtuous scholar—simpler in meaning and easier in text than the *Yijing*. Those who ascend the Jiao Mountains must first traverse the lowlands; those who journey to the distant seas must first follow the Yangtze and Han rivers. Thus, I wished to begin with the *Taixuan Jing*, gradually progressing to the *Yijing*, hoping to attain even a distant glimpse of its depths.\n\nAfter years of seeking, I finally obtained a copy. At first, its meaning was murky and indistinct, barely comprehensible. I then devoted myself to careful study, excluding all distractions, and read it dozens of times, comparing its beginning and end, gradually discerning its general outline. Then, sighing deeply, I placed the book down and exclaimed: Ah! Was Yangzi truly a great scholar?\n\nAfter Confucius’ passing, who else could have known the Dao of the Sage if not Yangzi? Mencius and Xunzi are hardly worthy of comparison, let alone the rest. The *Taixuan Jing* reveals the manifest as it reaches humanity and the profound as it exhausts the divine; it encompasses the vast as it embraces the cosmos, and delves into the minute as it enters hair and thread. It unifies the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and humanity into one, scraping away at its roots to reveal its origin, nurturing all things as their primal mother. Like the earth bearing weight without sinking, like the sea yielding water without depletion. Though there may be those who practice the Dao in the world, none can surpass this in ease.\n\nExamining it from the undifferentiated origin, the *Taixuan* was already born. Observing it in the present, the *Taixuan* is not without effect. Pursuing it to the end of Heaven and Earth, the *Taixuan* cannot be extinguished. Questioning it with the nature of all things reveals no gaps; probing it with the forms of spirits and gods finds no contradiction; aligning it with the Six Classics shows no inconsistency. Even if the Sage were to return, upon seeing the *Taixuan*, he would surely smile with delight, deeming it the fulfillment of his own heart.\n\nThus, it is clear that the *Taixuan* serves to complement the *Yijing*—not as a separate work competing with it. How shallow He Qin and Gu Xi knew it, yet how profound their misjudgment!\n\nSome say: *\"The principles of the Yijing differ from those of the Taixuan. Yangzi did not follow the Yijing but created his own system. How then does the Taixuan complement the Yijing?\"*\n\nMoreover, if the Taixuan shares the same Dao as the Yijing, then why have the Yijing at all? Why the Taixuan?\n\nI reply: The hunter’s tools serve to capture game—whether by net or by arrow, what difference does it make? Books serve to convey the Dao: the Yijing is the net, the Taixuan is the arrow. What harm is there?\n\nIf one rejects the arrow to rely solely on the net, your pursuit of the Dao will be stifled. Besides, Yangzi composed the *Fayan* to align with the *Analects*; he wrote the *Taixuan* to align with the *Yijing*. If you abandon the *Fayan* yet wish to discard the *Taixuan*, are you not confused?\n\nThe Dao of the *Fayan* and the *Analects*—do they truly differ? The relationship between the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing* is the same.\n\nWhen a great hall is about to collapse, one beam may prop it up, but nothing secures it like many beams. When the Great Dao is about to fade, one book may clarify it, but nothing illuminates it like many books. If a scholar can devote himself entirely to the *Yijing*, that is indeed sufficient. Yet the *Yijing* is Heaven itself, and the *Taixuan* is its ladder. Would you ascend to Heaven and abandon its ladder?\n\nEarlier scholars have expounded the *Taixuan*, and their interpretations are numerous. Yet Yangzi’s writing is rich in exegesis, pointing toward depths so profound that the *Taixuan* itself is the most difficult to grasp. Thus, I doubt whether earlier scholars fully captured Yangzi’s intent. The world must have those who can truly comprehend it—I shall study it until old age.\n\n---\n\n**On the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing*:**\nAt their core, the *Yijing* and the *Taixuan* share the same Dao but differ in method.\n\nThe *Yijing* employs two symbols: Yang and Yin.\nThe *Taixuan* employs three: One, Two, and Three.\n\nThe *Yijing* has six ranks; the *Taixuan* has four tiers:\nThe highest is called *Fang* (方), followed by *Zhou* (州), then *Bu* (部), and finally *Jia* (家).\nThis is what the *Benzhuan* refers to as \"threefold modeling and fourfold division,\" culminating in eighty-one.\n\nThe *Yijing* combines eight trigrams to form sixty-four hexagrams.\nThe *Taixuan* arranges One, Two, and Three across *Fang*, *Zhou*, *Bu*, and *Jia* to produce eighty-one chapters.\n\nEach *Jia* chapter shifts with every variation—three chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Zhou* (周), and *Lian* (礥).\nEach *Bu* shifts every three chapters—nine chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (闲), and *Shang* (上).\nEach *Zhou* shifts every nine chapters—twenty-seven chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (羡), and *Cong* (从).\nEach *Fang* shifts every twenty-seven chapters—eighty-one chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Geng* (更), and *Jian* (减).\n\nBeyond eighty-one chapters, no further addition is possible—thus, it is called the Dao of Nature.\n\nThe *Yijing* has six lines per hexagram, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines.\nThe *Taixuan* has nine *zan* (赞) per chapter, totaling seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*.\n\nThe Diagram states: *\"The Taixuan has two Dào—one arising from Three, one generated by Three.*\n*The Three that arise: Fang, Zhou, Bu, Jia.*\n*The Three that generate: the threefold division of yang-qi, forming three layers, culminating in nine camps.*\n*This is the same origin but separate manifestation—the fundamental pattern of Heaven and Earth.\"*\n\nThe *Ben Chuan* states: *\"The雄潭 contemplates the revolving Heaven, modeling it in threefold divisions and quartering it, culminating at eighty-one—this refers to the *Taixuan* chapters. Again, it says: 'Lateral divisions of threefold modeling and nine foundations, culminating at seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*—this refers to the *Taixuan zan*.' Chapters are akin to hexagrams, while *zan* are akin to lines.\n\nAgain, it says: 'Those who observe the *Yijing* name the hexagrams they see; those who observe the *Taixuan* count its strokes to determine it.' The *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are not hexagrams but numerical patterns. Thus, the *Yijing*’s six lines per hexagram each bear words, while the *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are supplemented by nine *zan*, governing what follows below. Therefore, chapters and *zan* proceed along separate paths, not interdependent. Both must be reckoned by days.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* arises from *Zhongfu*, and excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, and *Kan*—their twenty-four lines govern the twenty-four *qi*#9, while the remaining sixty hexagrams each span six days and seven fractions, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. *Zhongfu*’s initial line marks the start of the winter solstice. *Yi*’s upper line marks the end of the great snow. Thus, it cycles and returns to its beginning.\n\nThe *Taixuan*’s eighty-one chapters, each with nine *zan*, total seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*. Every two *zan* combine into one day—one for day, one for night—yielding three hundred sixty-four days and a half. Adding the *Zhuolei* two *zan* completes three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. The first *zan* marks the start of the winter solstice, while the *Zhuolei* two *zan* mark the end of the great snow. It too cycles and returns to its beginning.\n\nAll *Taixuan* chapters follow the *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* sequence but vary in nomenclature. The first is *Zhongfu*; the cyclical return is *Fu*; *Li* and *Xian* correspond to *Lun*; *Shao* to *Qian*; *Li* to *Kui*. The rest follow this pattern. Thus, the *Taixuan* chapters declare: *\"Eighty-one chapters, all affairs are divinely verified. The *Ce* says: 'Perform the *Xun Cheng* ritual, aligning with the Dipper’s encounter. The calendar marks the years, and the grains flourish in season.' All this is as stated.*\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Yuan*, *Heng*, *Li*, and *Zhen*; the *Taixuan* has *Wang*, *Zhi*, *Meng*, *Qiu*, and *Ming*. These five are the *Taixuan*’s virtues. *Wang* is the north, corresponding to *Zhen* in the *Yijing*. *Zhi* is the east, corresponding to *Yuan*. *Meng* is the south, corresponding to *Heng*. *Qiu* is the west, corresponding to *Li*#10. *Ming* is formless. Thus, the *Taixuan* text states: *\"Wang and Meng reach their extremes, Zhi and Qiu command each other; emerging from Ming and returning to Ming, new and old alternate.\"*\n\nSince the *Taixuan* begins at the winter solstice, it divides *Zhen* into *Wang* and *Ming*. *Wang* is the period after the winter solstice; *Ming* is before the great snow.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Great Correlation* number is fifty, with forty-nine in use. The *Taixuan*’s Heaven and Earth strategies are eighteen each, totaling thirty-six. Earth omits three, using thirty-three. The *Yijing* casts with four; the *Taixuan* casts with three. The *Taixuan* casting method: divide one hexagram in half, then use three casts per unit—one as *sou*, one as *huan*. Combine the remainder with *tiao*, and after one *tiao*, count the rest: seven as one, eight as two, nine as three. The *Yijing* has seven, nine, eight, and six—called the four symbols. The *Taixuan* has one, two, and three—called the threefold models. Both are the numerical foundations of hexagram chapters.\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Tuan*, the *Taixuan* has chapters. *Tuan* is the hexagram’s text; chapters likewise summarize the meaning of a single chapter. The *Yijing* has lines, the *Taixuan* has *zan*. The *Yijing* has symbols, the *Taixuan* has *Ce*. *Ce* interprets the *zan*. The *Yijing* has *Wenyan*, the *Taixuan* has *Wen*. *Wen* elucidates the Five Virtues, alongside the central chapter’s nine *zan*—akin to *Wenyan*.\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Xici*, the *Taixuan* has *Chui*, *Ying*, *Lian*, *Tu*, and *Gao*. These five expound upon the *Taixuan zan*—akin to *Xici*. The *Yijing* has *Shuo Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Shu*. *Shu* discusses the symbols of the nine *zan*—akin to *Shuo Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Xu Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Chong*. *Chong* sequences the eighty-one chapters, resolving yin and yang oppositions—akin to *Xu Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Za Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Cuo*. *Cuo* interweaves and expounds upon the eighty-one chapters. Though paths diverge, they converge; myriad thoughts unite in harmony, all rooted in the *Taiji*, Two Principles, Three Talents, Four Seasons, and Five Phases, returning to Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety.\n\n#9 *\"Kan\"* originally *\"Zhao\"*, *\"xiao\"* originally *\"zhi\"*, *\"zhu\"* originally *\"yu\"*—corrected according to *Beiyao* and *Quanshu* editions.\n#10

virtuous.\nThus, they can each time cultivate self-restraint,\nto preserve their stability.\n\nThe reason a *hill* tilts is its sharpness.\nIf one can each time increase its height,\nyet also sharpen its edge,\nmaking it gentle and sloping,\nthen it will never tilt.\nThis is the *hill*’s true **Dao**/Way.\n*Zhèng Kāo Fù*’s three commandments—\nnow even more reverent.\nThe first commandment, he bent his back;\nthe second, he stooped his body;\nthe third, he bowed his head.\n\n**Eighth line:** It combines *shells* (augury) to serve—\nbenefiting in the going, harm in the coming.\n**Cè** says: It combines *shells* (augury) to serve—\nthis is rejoicing now, ruin later.\n*Harm* is pronounced *xuē* (to shave).\n*Shells* are *wealthy resources*.\n*To serve* is *menial labor*.\nTo use wealthy resources for menial labor,\ngreed without end.\nThough benefiting in the going,\nharm comes in the coming—\nthus, it is rejoicing now, ruin later.\n\n**Uppermost Nine:**\n*Lofty and towering*, it does not collapse—\nrelying on the *supporting marsh*.\n**Cè** says: *Lofty and towering*, it does not collapse—\nthis is the gathering of many virtuous.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* editions render *supporting marsh* as *yǐng yōng* (unclear), I follow the *Fàn*, *Wáng*, and *Xiaosong* editions.\n*Lofty* is pronounced *cuī* (to depart).\n*Supporting* is pronounced *yǒng* (two).\n*Marsh* is pronounced *mǐ* (to conceal).\n*Gathering* is pronounced *qú* (channel).\n\n**Fàn** says: *Supporting marsh* is the *foot of the mountain*.\n**Wáng** says: *Gathering* is the appearance of *support*.\n**Guāng** says: Nine is at the extreme of increase,\nencountering the utmost misfortune.\nYet it escapes blame,\nfor the many virtuous serve as its aid.\nLike a high mountain that does not collapse,\nrelying on the *supporting marsh* as its foundation.\n\n**One *Zhōu*, Two *Fāng*, Two *Shì*, Two *Jiā*, Two *Bù* Sharpened:**\n\n**Yin Family Earth, measured by gradualness.**\n\n**First Sharpness (Hexagram 5):**\nEntering the fifth rank, thirty-one degrees and thirteen seconds;\nresponding to the *Rain Water* qi.\nThe Yang qi is lofty and sharp—\nall things in their generation\nare single-minded and undivided.\n*Lofty* (*cén*): pronounced *chú zān* (plow-pin).\n*Lofty* (*cénrán*): the appearance of sharpness.\nThe Dao of sharpness values singularity.\n\n**First line (yín):**\nThe crab’s encircling retreat,\nlater the earthworm drinks from the Yellow Spring.\n**Commentary:** The crab’s encircling retreat—\nits heart is not singular.\n**Fàn** says: *Encircling retreat*—the form of many legs.\n**Wáng** says: *Encircling retreat*—encompassing abundance.\n**Wú** says: *Encompassing abundance*—the appearance of restless agitation.\n**Guāng** cites *Xúnzǐ*:\n*The earthworm lacks sharp claws or strong bones,\nyet it eats the dust above and drinks from the Yellow Spring below—\nall because its mind is singular.*\nThe crab walks on six legs yet wields two claws,\nand without the holes of snakes and tortoises has nowhere to shelter—\nits mind is restless.\nOne is the beginning of thought,\nand corresponds to night,\nwhen family nature is sharp,\nthus this symbol arises.\n*Dì* (kneel): *qù wěi* (abandoned), meaning *foot*.\n\n**Second line (yáng):**\nSharp and singular—\nnothing it does not reach.\n**Commentary:** The reach of sharp singularity—\nit must grasp the Dao.\nTwo is the midpoint of thought,\nand corresponds to day,\nthus it is said: *Sharp and singular—\nnothing it does not reach.*\nAll possess one virtue:\n*\"Virtue is singular—\nin action, nothing is unauspicious;\nvirtue is two or three—\nin action, nothing is auspicious.\"*\n**Xúnzǐ** says:\n*\"He who walks the crossroads does not arrive,\nhe who serves two lords is not contained.\nThe eye does not see two things and yet is clear,\nthe ear does not hear two things and yet is keen.\nThe flying snake has no feet,\nthe five-skilled dormouse is exhausted.\nThe *Shī* says:*\n*The cuckoo in the mulberry,\nits seven younglings.\nThe virtuous gentleman’s bearing is singular—\nhis bearing is singular,\nhis heart is knotted.*\nThus the gentleman binds himself to singularity.\"*\n\n**Third line (yín):**\nMad sharpness—\ndrift.\n**Commentary:** The drift of mad sharpness—\nit cannot dwell in singularity.\nThree is the end of thought,\nand corresponds to night.\n*Mad*—to advance without singularity.\nDrifting without foundation,\nsuccess is unseen.\n*The Yì* says:\n*\"Advancing like a weasel-mouse—\nperseverance brings peril.\"*\n\n**Fourth line (yáng):**\nSharp in season—\nnothing is unprofitable.\n**Commentary:** Sharp in season—\nit finds its due.\nFour is the beginning of fortune,\nand corresponds to the *huà* (drawing),\nfor sharpness that meets its time—\nthus nothing is unprofitable.\n\n**Fifth line (yín):**\nSharp to the east, forgetting the west;\nseeing its back, not seeing its heart.\n**Commentary:** Sharp to the east, forgetting the west—\nit cannot turn aside.\n*Back*—the exterior.\n*Heart*—the interior.\nFive is peak fortune,\nand corresponds to night,\nwhen the petty man knows gain but not loss,\nsees profit without heeding harm,\ngreedily pursues the front while abandoning the rear,\ndiscards the interior to chase the exterior.\n\n**Sixth line (yáng):**\nSharp at *chǒu* (the multitude),\ncontaining the five tracks and ten thousand *zhòng*,\npersevering.\n**Commentary:** Sharp at *chǒu*—\nfortune and rank are boundless.\n*Chǒu*—the multitude.\nSix is supreme fortune,\nyet also extreme abundance,\ncorresponding to the *huà* (drawing),\nfor the sharpness of its beauty.\nThe gentleman’s advancement\nseeks only to harmonize the multitude—\nthus it can contain the five tracks and ten thousand *zhòng*\nwithout losing its rectitude.\nIn ancient times, *xú* was measured by tracks.\n*A track*—the space between two wheel ruts,\neight *chǐ* wide.\nTen *dù* make a *zhòng*.\n*A zhòng*—six *hú* and four *dòu*.\nFive tracks—explaining breadth;\nten thousand *zhòng*—discussing multitude.\n\n**Seventh line (yín):**\nSharp at profit—\nshame and evil arrive.\n**Commentary:** Sharp at profit—\nhumiliation lies in one direction.\n**Fàn** says: *Shame*—humiliation.\n**Guāng** says: Seven is the beginning of calamity,\nand corresponds to night,\nwhen the petty man, sharp at profit,\nincurs humiliation and evil.\n*Direction*—toward.\nHumiliation lies in one direction—\nspeaking of how one incurs shame\nthrough a single pursuit of profit,\nwithout considering righteousness.\n\n**Eighth line (yáng):**\nSharpening its sharpness,\nrescuing its failures.\n**Commentary:** Sharpening its sharpness—\nfearing it may turn to disaster.\nEight is the midpoint of calamity,\nand corresponds to day,\nwhen the gentleman, seeing gain, considers righteousness,\nlooks ahead while looking back,\nthough sharpening its sharpness,\nyet always rescues its failures—\nthus it avoids disaster and blame.\n\n**Ninth line (yáng):**\nLofty and precipitous cliffs—\n*tuò*.\n**Commentary:** Lofty and precipitous cliffs—\nsharpness at its extreme must collapse.\n*Tuò*: *zhí ěr* (straight).\n**Fàn** says: *Tuò*—to fall.\n*Jīng*—referring to *jīngróng* (towering).\n*Qiào*—steep.\nTowering and steep, about to fall below—\nthus it is said *tuò*.\n\n**One *Fāng*, Two *Zhōu*, Two *Bù*, Three *Jiā* Reach.**\n**Yang Family Water #8, measured by *Tài*.**\n\n**Initial One (yīn):**\nEntering at the first day—\n**She East Wall.**\nYang-qi branches, sprouts, and tendrils emerge—\nAll things attain their reach.\n\n**Song** says:\nWhat branches off is called *méi*,\nWhat sprouts from *méi* is called *tiáo*.\nSpeaking of yang-qi stirring outward—\nAll things receive their principle,\nNone entangled by hooks yet fail to reach.\n\n**Lu** says:\n*Branches, sprouts, tendrils emerge*—#9\nThis speaks of yang’s boundless dissemination,\nNone left unpenetrated.\n\n**Initial One (yáng):**\nMidnight’s lone clarity—\nPiercing, unyielding.\n**Commentary:** Midnight’s lone clarity—\nInner illumination without bounds.\n*Jiǒng*—*jiǒngtú nòngqiè*.\n**Fan** says: *Jiǒng*—to traverse.\n*Qū*—to exhaust.\n**Guāng** says: One—\nThe subtlest of thought,\nThus called *midnight’s clarity*.\nAt the day’s dawn,\nThe gentleman’s inner light is silent yet knowing,\nPiercing all directions without bound.\n\n**Second Two:**\nConfused in the belly, clarity in the eyes.\n**Commentary:** Confused in the belly, clarity in the eyes—\nBecause the Dao is not illuminated.\n**Song and Lu** originally said \"not illuminated by the Dao,\"\nNow following **Fan**.\n**Guāng** says: Two—\nThe midpoint of thought,\nYet at night,\nInner clarity obscured,\nThen outward sight is also unexamined.\nThus, failing to illuminate the Dao,\nYet relying on external perception—\nNo benefit.\n*Yǐ*—to use.\nWhy confused in the belly, clear in the eyes?\nBecause the Dao’s use is not illuminated.\n\n**Third Three:**\nSapling wood, its tendrils flowing—\nIts virtue may reach to the gourd’s calyx.\n**Commentary:** Sapling wood, its tendrils flowing—\nInner benevolence measuring outward.\n*Liàng*—*lì zhāng qiè*.\n**Fan** says: *Wéiliú*—branches and sprouts descending.\nThe gourd’s calyx clings to the earth;\nIf wood does not lower its tendrils,\nThen it cannot be bound and led upward.\n**Guāng** says: *Bāo*—same as *páo*.\nThree—\nThe advancing person,\nNear fortune, at day’s dawn.\nThe virtuous: what one wishes to establish, one establishes for others;\nWhat one wishes to reach, one reaches for others—\nNot hoarding its beauty.\nLike wood lowering its branches to reach below,\nThus gourds and calyxes are bound and led upward.\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"South stands the twisted wood,\nSweet gourds hang in clusters.\"*\n\n**Fourth Four:**\nSmall gain, small reach—\nGreat confusion, flat and flat—\nNo salvation.\n**Commentary:** Small reach, great confusion—\nLone clarity in a corner and a direction.\n*Biān*—*bì miǎn qiè*.\n**Lu** says: Lone clarity in a corner and a direction—\nSpeaking of not knowing the four-way reach.\n**Guāng** says: *Biānbiān*—narrow and confined.\nFour—\nLow fortune, at night,\nThus small gain.\nThe petty man knows only a corner and a direction,\nNot the great Dao,\nHis gains are narrow,\nUnable to save what he loses.\n**Pénchéng Kuò** served in Qi;\nMencius knew he would die.\nSaying: *\"His talents are small,\nHe has not heard the gentleman’s great Dao—\nEnough to kill his body, but nothing more.\"*\n\n**Fifth Five:**\nReaching the central thoroughfare—\nGreat and small, no confusion.\n**Commentary:** Reaching the central thoroughfare—\nThe Dao’s four-way passage.\nFive—\nCentral harmony, also clarity,\nAt day’s dawn,\nThe peak of reach.\n\n**Six Six:**\nGreat reach, no boundaries—\nDo not neglect ditches and levees—\n**Opposition.**\n**Commentary:** Great reach, no boundaries—\nCannot follow one-sidedly.\n*Zhěn*—*zhī rén qiè*.\nSix—\nExtreme greatness, past the midpoint, at night,\nThus *great reach, no boundaries*.\n*Zhěn*—field boundaries.\n*Xù*—what marks field boundaries.\n*Zuò*—to govern.\nThe gentleman’s Dao must have altars and halls.\nLike vast fields without boundaries—\nIf levees and ditches are not maintained,\nGovernance within becomes neglected.\nCannot follow one-sidedly—\nFields are vast; this way loses that.\n\n**Seventh Seven:**\nReaching to acupuncture and incision—\nWhat precedes is lost, what follows is relied upon.\n**Commentary:** Reaching to acupuncture and incision—\nUltimately not abandoned.\n*Biān*—*bǐ yàn qiè*.\n**Wang** says: Though there be the pain of acupuncture and incision,\nUltimately gain the cure’s benefit.\n*Lài*—benefit.\n**Guāng** says: *Biān*—stone used to probe disease.\nSeven—\nThe knife, also the start of calamity,\nAt day’s dawn.\nThe gentleman reaches to changes—\nKnowing calamity’s approach,\nSevering attachments, discarding evil,\nLike acupuncture and incision removing disease.\nThough some is lost,\nLater gains its benefit—\nNot a wasted cure.\n\n**Eighth Eight:**\nConfused in the eyes, clear in the belly.\n**Commentary:** Confused in the eyes, clear in the belly—\nOuter deception of the inner.\nTwo is in the inner body,\nThus *clear in the belly*.\nEight is in the outer body,\nThus *confused in the eyes*.\nDeceived by external things,\nWith inner clarity,\nThough the heart knows it false,\nYet cannot restrain itself—\nThus it ends in ruin.\n\n**Ninth Nine:**\nReaching to blame—\n**Authentic, ending in praise.**\n**Commentary:** Reaching to blame, ending in praise—\nWithdrawing well by the Dao.\nNine—\nCalamity’s end, at day’s dawn.\nThe gentleman knows calamity’s extremity,\nGuarding correctness and withdrawing,\nNot losing his good name.\n\n---\n**One *Fāng*, Two *Zhōu*, Three *Bù*, One *Jiā* Exchange**\n**Yin Family Fire**, also measured by *Tài*.\nYang exchanges with yin, yin with yang.\nThings ascend to the Hall of Clarity—\n*Yūyū huánghuáng*.\n**Small Song** originally: *\"Yin and yang exchange in harmony,\nEndless grace.\"*\nNow following other editions.\n*Yū*—sounds like *yù*.\n**Song** says: At the seventh division, the hexagram is *Tài*.\nAscending yang at Three—\nAlready above the earth.\n**Lu** says: Below the earth is the Yellow Palace,\nThus above the earth is the Hall of Clarity.\n*Yūyū huánghuáng*—restful and beautiful.\n**Wang** says: *Yūyū huánghuáng*—the appearance of brilliant clarity.\n\n**Initial One (yīn):**\nDark exchange with the spirit—\nNot solemn in its authenticity.\n**Commentary:** Dark exchange, not authentic.\nHolding deceit, containing shame.\n*Sī*—same as *zhāi*.\n**Fan** says: *Míng*—obscurity.\nExchanging with ghosts and spirits,\nMust be solemn and respectful.\n*Sī*—fasting.\n*Zhēn*—sincerity.\nExchanging with ghosts and spirits,\nThough in darkness,\nWithout sincerity,\nThe spirits do not bless.\n**Guāng** says: One—\nThe beginning of thought,\nAt night,\nThus this symbol.\n\n「Second Two: Dark exchange with sincerity, bright and clear.\n**Xie** says: Sincere dark exchange—trustworthy communion with the numinous.\nTwo is the midpoint of thought#14 and corresponds to day;\nThe virtuous one can thus exchange with ghosts and spirits in bright sincerity.\n\nThird Three: Exchange with wood and stone.\n**Ce** says: Exchange with wood and stone—unable to benefit others.\nThree is the completion of intent#15, the first external exchange, occurring at nightfall.\nTo exchange with the foolish as with wood and stone—\nNo mutual benefit can be gained.\n**Confucius** said: Do not befriend those not as good as yourself.\n\nFourth Four: Difficult to approach, reeking with incense, entering the gate of loss.\n**Ce** says: Coming and going with incense—conducting exchanges with the spirits.\nWang’s original text reads *fú* (福) for *shén* (神), now following other editions.\n**Wang** says: *Xūnxūn*—the appearance of multitude.\n\nFifth Five: Exchange with parrots and gibbons, gaining no honor.\n**Ce** says: Exchange with parrots and gibbons—aligning with beasts.\nParrots, though speaking, do not depart from birds;\nGibbons, though speaking, do not depart from beasts.\nFive occupies the position of maturity, yet corresponds to night#18—\nExchanging with things without propriety.\nTo seek honor without ritual—how can it be attained?#19\nThe *Shijing* says#20:\n*\"The rhinoceros horn cup is filled,\nSweet wine, thoughts of gentleness.\nTheir exchange was not arrogant,\nTen thousand blessings come seeking.\"*\n\nSixth Six: The great feast is vast and splendid, the small feast exchanges within it.\nI have sacred viands, and I share them with you.\n**Ce** says: The exchange of great and small—awaiting the virtuous with radiant brilliance.\nThe original editions of Song, Lu, and Wang read *gégé* (阁阁) for *hónghóng* (闳闳); now following Fan’s edition.\nFan and Wang’s editions read *xiǎo* (殽) for *yáo* (肴); now following Song, Lu, and Wang’s editions.\nFan’s edition sometimes reads *sàn* (散) for *xiǎo* (殽).\n*Quān* (圈) is pronounced *qiú* (求晚切).\n**Wang** says: *Quān*—the vessel for prepared dishes.\nThe way of awaiting the worthy shines brightly—\nThe peak of exchange.\n**Guang** says: *Quān*—nurturing and storing leisurely.\n*Hónghóng*—vast in appearance.\n*Líng*—excellent.\n*Yáo*—the body of the offering.\nThe character *xiǎo* (殽) should be *yáo* (肴).\n*Yáo*—to eat.\nThe great feast speaks to the wealthy virtuous,\nThe small feast to those without rank.\nSix is abundance and corresponds to the evening.\nThe virtuous, with their blessings, rejoice to share with the worthy.\nThe *Yijing* says: *\"I have fine wine, I share it with you.\"*\n\nSeventh Seven: Exchange with birds and mice, depleting the millet.\n**Ce** says: Exchange with birds and mice—mere deception and waste.\nSeven is ruin and corresponds to night.\nTo exchange with the wrong people—only waste remains.\nThe *Fayan* says: *\"Frequent associations,\nWorse than [blank]#24,\nThis is but robbing praise and food.\"*\n\nEighth Eight: Spear and halberd coming and going, with sincerity—no regret.\n**Ce** says: Spear and halberd coming and going—military action cannot be abandoned.\nEight is the midpoint of calamity; exchanges not made with benevolence but with arms,\nThus it is said: spear and halberd coming and going.\nYet it corresponds to the evening of the day—\nThe virtuous use arms to suppress chaos and curb tyranny,\nEmploying them only when unavoidable.\nNot deviating from the proper way, hence no regret.\nThe rod and flog cannot be relaxed in the home,\nPunishments cannot be abolished in the state,\nMilitary campaigns cannot be halted under Heaven—\nTheir use has beginnings and ends, their conduct has order and sequence.\n\nUpper Nine: Exchange in warfare#21—unauthentic.\nOverthrown at the city, fierce and devouring.\n**Ce** says: Exchange in warfare#22—how can it be pursued?\nNine is the extremity of calamity, corresponding to night.\nThe petty exchange in victorious warfare#23,\nNot in accordance with the proper way—\nThose who overturn states and ruin families.\nAttacking *Jié* with *Jié*#25,\nTheir virtue not differing,\nThen only the fierce devour the weak—\nNo superiority or inferiority exists.\nOne region, two states, three departments, two families—\n*Rǎn* (耎), same as *ruǎn* (软).»\n\nThe **Yang** family’s wood, aligned with *Xū* (需).\nEntering *Rǎn* (耎) at the first day, called **\"Sheltering Kuí\"** (舍奎).\nEntering the second nine, eight *fēn* twenty seconds, called **\"Subsequent Descent of Lóu\"** (次降娄).\n\nAt the **Awakening of Insects** (*Jǐngzhé*), the Dipper (*Fùxiàng*) aligns with the *Mǎo* position, the *Lǜ* (律) resonates with *Jiá Zhōng* (夹钟).\nThe **Yang qi** can be firm yet yielding, can act yet rest, retreating when encountering difficulty.\nDifficulty—this is the *dàn* (旦) cutting.\nOn the first day, the **red sprouts** are sharp and pointed, advantageous to advance by withdrawing.\n**Ce** says: The red sprouts sharp and pointed—withdraw to move.\n**Fàn** says: The red sprouts—when grass and trees first sprout their buds.\n**Guāng** says: When buds first emerge, they must first curve and bend#24—like the virtuous withdrawing to advance themselves.\n\nOn the second day, **softening the heart**, illness arises.\n**Ce** says: Softening the heart—there is no courage within.\nThe second is **thought within**, and it corresponds to night.\nThe family’s nature is softness, and its disease is the lack of courage.\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals Transmission* says: *\"Ren without martial virtue cannot achieve its purpose.\"*\n\nOn the third day, **softening the knees**, guarding its limits.\nThough not unrestrained, ultimately there is no defiance.\n**Ce** says: Softening the knees—the body cannot be unrestrained.\nKnees—same as *xī* (膝).\nDefiance—*fú* (拂), pronounced *fú-wù*.\n**Wáng** says: Defiance—*lì* (戾).\n**Guāng** says: The third pertains to the lower body, hence \"softening the knees.\"\nThough it cannot act freely, it ultimately does not violate the proper Way.\n\nOn the fourth day, **softening the throat**, three years without swallowing.\n**Ce** says: Softening the throat, swallowing lost—timing and measure are missed.\nThroat—pronounced *wā* (哇), *yú-jiā* cutting.\nSwallowing—*nuò* (噣);\n\n「Zhújiǎo qiè, yòu yīn huà.\nWáng

Though they guāyǎzé, if they seek only fleeting, immediate pleasure, how far is their suffering from them? It lies just beyond the door, no farther.\"*\n\nFrom the *Shī·Yúzhào* (Book of Poetry: \"The Fishes and Reeds\"), it censures King Yōu’s words: *\"All things lose their nature, the king dwelling in Hào and Jīng, shall find no joy in himself.\"*#\n\nThe fourth day: *\"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Stroking bonds and severing cords—truly a heart at ease. Bonds, the same as *system* (系). Cords, pronounced *shuāng* (as in 'thread'). To stroke, is to depart. Cords, are the central threads in the weft of a net.\"*#\nThe fourth day marks *tiáochàng* (harmony), while in daylight. The virtuous man follows the Dao/Way, finding joy in forgetting his cares, external things unable to burden him, and none are more free than he.#\nThus it says: *\"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts.\"*\n\nThe fifth day: *\"Bell and drum clamor—clamor—pipes and strings sigh—sigh—perhaps to follow its decline.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Bell and drum clamor—joy followed by sorrow. Sigh—both pronounced *cuò* (as in 'wrong'). Sigh-sigh, the sound of fading thoughts.\"*#\nThe fifth day marks the petty man indulging in great fortune, unrestrained in his licentious pleasures. Joy to its extreme must bring sorrow; prosperity to its peak must decline.\n\nThe sixth day: *\"Great joy without interruption, people and spirits, birds and beasts all find their delight.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Great joy without interruption—none are left without embracing it.\"*#\n**Dàn** (as in \"charm\"), pronounced *púgān* (as in \"to float\").\n**Wáng** says: *\"The sixth day resides in a position of greatness, at the time of daylight, as the leader of the group. Without interruption means that between heaven and earth, all things find joy, and people, spirits, birds, and beasts each fulfill their nature and float in delight.\"*\n**Guāng** says: *\"Dàn (float), is joy.\"*#\nThe sixth day marks *lóngfú* (abundant blessings), *shèngduō* (great prosperity), and *jímǎ* (ultimate greatness). The virtuous man of the *Tàipíng* (Great Peace) era benefits all things, with no distinctions—people, spirits, birds, and beasts all find their place, and what joy is greater than this? The fourth day marks *xiàlù* (lower fortune), benefiting only oneself; the sixth day marks *shànglù* (higher fortune), benefiting all under heaven.\n\nThe seventh day: *\"Men laugh, ghosts laugh, heaven’s appointed term.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Men laugh, ghosts laugh—celebrating the completion of joy.\"*#\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *bēi* (low) instead of *bì* (completion); now following **Fàn**’s version.\n**Yāo** (term), pronounced *yúxiāo* (as in \"nightfall\").\n\nThe **King** says: *\"Yào (term), is yuē (restraint/limit).\"*\n**Guāng** says: *\"Xī (laugh), is an exclamation of joy.\"*\n\nThe seventh day marks *huòshǐ* (beginning of calamity), yet it falls at night.\nThe petty man, when his joy reaches its peak, invites calamity—both men and ghosts exclaim in lament, unaware that the great decree is near its end.\n\nThe eighth day: *\"Laughter and exclamations, self-fear, no guilt nor misfortune.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"Laughter and exclamations in self-fear—ultimately self-preservation.\"*\n\nThe **King** says: *\"The Dao of joy is nearing its extreme, yet one still lingers within calamity. This is the perilous path.*\nYet if one holds a position of day, excels in rectifying faults, then even amid laughter and exclamations of mirth, one can still self-fear—thus there will be no guilt nor misfortune.\"\n\nThe ninth day, highest: *\"The brink of extreme joy, sorrow without waiting for the day to shift—then the resources for weeping arise.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"The brink of extreme joy—truly something to repent.\"*\n**Jī** (brink), pronounced *jī* (as in \"machine\").\n**Zī** (resources), pronounced *chēn* (as in \"anger\"), is the swelling of flesh.\n**Lù** says: *\"Jī (brink), is danger.\"*\nThe **King** says: *\"At the extreme of joy, yet still at night—sorrow comes immediately, thus the weeping and exclamations of lament.*\n**Guāng** says: *\"The three [days] warn against excess in thought; the five [days] warn against excess in fortune; the nine [days] warn against excess in calamity.*\nThe overarching principle is that joy cannot be pushed to its extreme, urging one to remain ever mindful and reflective throughout.\"*\n\n---\n\n**One family in three states and three departments contends for the Yang family’s fire—litigation.**\nThe **Yang** *qì* (qi) spreads evenly, neither partial nor biased.\nThings involved in litigation each follow their proper order.\n**Shì** (spread), pronounced *shì* (as in \"style\").\n**Shī** (apply), pronounced *shì* (as in \"sauce\").\n**Pō** (bias), pronounced *pǔhé* (as in \"universal\").\n**Yí** (order), is what is fitting.\nThe **Yang** *qì* spreads evenly and balanced—all things vie to advance, seeking to fulfill their proper order.\nThe *Shī* (Book of Poetry) says: *\"By proper order, all things are born, each attaining its fitting place.\"*#41\n\nThe first day: *\"Contend not to contend—subtle and hidden.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"Contend not to contend—this is the Dao’s inherent nature.\"*\n**Lù** says: *\"Sù (subtle), is zì (natural quality).\"*\nThe **King** says: *\"Contend not to contend—this means to contend before things take form, unseen in their traces.\"*\n**Guāng** says: *\"The first day marks the beginning of thought, yet it falls at day.*\nThe virtuous man holds the Dao’s inherent nature, contending in the realm of non-contention. Externally, no trace appears, yet nothing can overcome him.\"*\n\nThe second day: *\"Threaten the river—emaciated and shamed.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"The emaciated shame of threatening the river—what can it achieve?\"*\n**Hè** (threaten), pronounced *hūjià* (as in \"call off marriage\").\n**Zhuó** (emaciated), pronounced *qíqú* (as in \"both together\"), is lean.\n**Zī** (shame), is the same as *hù* (rely on).\nTo reject others with words is called *hè*.\nWhen the river overflows, who can reject it?\nYet an emaciated and shamed man, not measuring his strength, dares to threaten it with words—how inadequate is this?\nThe *Shī* (Book of Poetry) says: *\"Return with your fierce threats.\"*#42\n\nThe third day: *\"Contend in archery, earnest and earnest.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"Contend in archery, earnest and earnest—this is the virtuous man yielding to his neighbor.\"*\n**Fàn**’s version reads *qú* (earnest) instead of *yín* (archery’s earnestness); now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.\n**Shè** (archery), pronounced *shènyè* (as in \"divine night\").\n**Yín** (earnest), pronounced *yín* (as in \"silver\").\nThe **King** says: *\"The virtuous man’s contention is only in archery.\"*\n**Yín yín** (earnest and earnest), is the appearance of utmost diligence.\nTo yield to one’s neighbor is akin to yielding in deference, and its meaning reads *yín* as *qiǎn* (earnestly).\n**Guāng** says: *\"Yín (earnest), is the same as qú (deference).\"*\n**Qú qú** (deference and deference), is the appearance of respectful yielding.\nConfucius says: *\"The virtuous man has no contention.*\nIf there must be contention, let it be in archery.\"\nWith bows and deference, ascending; descending to drink, its contention is that of the virtuous.\n\nThe fourth day: *\"Contend for petty gains, not attaining sincerity.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"If petty gains are unceasing, the proper path grows dim.\"*\nThe **King** says#42: *\"Contend not by the Dao, yet contend for petty gains—it is fitting that one does not attain the path of sincerity.\"*#43\n\nThe fifth day: *\"Contend in the thoroughfare, gains without measure.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"Contend in the thoroughfare—this is contention at the midpoint.\"*\n**Fàn** says: *\"The fifth day is at the central position, hence called thoroughfare.\"*\n**Dù** (thoroughfare), is the ninefold path.\n**Guāng** says: *\"The fifth day marks central harmony, yet falls at day.*\nThe virtuous man holds the Dao’s key, the convergence of governance, responding to changes without measure—nothing can contend with him.\"*\n\nThe sixth day: *\"Arms and shoulders like calves, thighs and legs swollen—this is bodily illness.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"Arms and shoulders like calves—this is the minister’s excessive power.\"*\n**Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *jìng* (calves) instead of *jìng* (shinbones), with the meaning pronounced *dié* (swelling).\nNow following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Fàn** versions.\n**Fàn**’s version reads: *\"Arms and shoulders like calves\"*—now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.\n**Fàn** says: *\"Branches grow larger than the trunk; ministers exceed their sovereign—both are illnesses.\"*\n**Guāng** says: *\"Arms and shoulders like calves—this means arms are as large as shinbones, unmanageable.\"*\n**Chēn** (swollen), pronounced *chēn* (as in \"anger\"), is the swelling of flesh.\nThe sixth day, with its **Yīn** essence, surpasses the midpoint and reaches its peak—like a minister’s overpowering strength, which the sovereign cannot control.\n**Jiǎ Yì** (Jia Yi) says: *\"The world suffers from great swelling; a shinbone’s bulk nearly matches the waist, a finger’s size nearly matches the thigh.\"*\n\nThe seventh day: *\"Contend for the trunk and spear, offering sacrifices at the King’s procession.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"The contention of the trunk and spear—this is guarding the sovereign’s person.\"*\n**Wáng**’s version reads *\"contend at the spear\"* instead of *\"contend for the trunk and spear\"*—**Cè** says *\"contend at the spear\"*—now following all versions.\n*Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *\"offering sacrifices to

(procession), pronounced *hùláng* (as in \"door\").\n\nThe seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity—\nits use of arms is for contention.\nThus it says: *\"Contend for the trunk and spear, helmet and shield.\"*\n\nTo contend with arms, not for private gain but for the public cause—\nwhat greater fortune could there be?\n\nThe *Odes* say:\n*\"The prime chariot leads with ten teams,\nto

pivot,\ncontemplation has yet to unfold—\none should seek counsel from the virtuous,\nto find the proper course.*\n\nBut on that very night, foolish and self-reliant,\nhe neither consults nor divines,\nthus losing his wise symbol.\n\nEmperor Yao sought counsel from the masses,\nShun took joy in accepting others’ virtues as his own,\nand Confucius asked questions in every matter.\n\nThe third line:\n*\"Time departs and returns,\nno space for delay.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Time departs and returns—\nit does not lose its course.\"*\nThe *Wang* text omits the character *container* (容), following the *Song*, *Lǚ*, and *Fàn* editions.\nThe third line represents *completed intent*.\nWhen contemplation is complete,\none must center his will and act.\nIf one misses the moment,\nregret comes too late—\nthus it says: *\"Time departs and returns,\nno space for delay,\"*\nspeaking of how gain and loss\nlie in a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe fourth line:\n*\"Male and female affairs,\nno substitution of characters.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Male and female affairs—\nthis is not their proper duty.\"*\n**Wang** says:\n*\"If it is not their affair,\nit must lead to misfortune.\"*\nFor a male to attend to female affairs\nis a grave dereliction—\nwhy not substitute the character *nurture* (育)?\nThe fourth line exceeds its proper measure at night,\ncontrary to its due place,\nhence the saying.\n\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"If a man substitutes for a woman’s duties, his household will suffer misfortune;\nif a subject usurps the ruler’s authority, the state will fall into disorder.\nThis makes clear that each affair has its proper constant.\"*\n\nThe fifth line:\n*\"Attend to one’s own affairs,\nthe king grants him sustenance.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Attend to one’s own affairs—\nthis is the duty one is tasked with.\"*\n**Wang** says:\n*\"Grant\" (假) means \"to bestow upon.\"*\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"To attend to one’s own affairs means\nto attend to what one ought to attend to.\nEach holds his proper station,\nthus the king bestows upon him sustenance—\nreceiving blessings and emoluments.\"*\n\nThe sixth line:\n*\"Bearing great responsibility alone,\nwhen it arrives, no aid comes.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Bearing great responsibility alone—\nhow can it be borne?\"*\nThe sixth line exceeds the midpoint and reaches its extreme,\nwhere strength is small yet the burden is heavy—\nthus it says: *\"Bearing great responsibility alone.\"*\nThe matter is about to arrive,\nthus collapse and ruin cannot be averted.\n\nThe seventh line:\n*\"The elder supports the orphaned,\nthe young boy carries the pitcher.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"The elder supports the orphaned—\nthe young boy knows his place.\"*\n**Wang** says:\n*\"Though the seventh line exceeds its measure,\nit finds its proper place in the day,\nnot losing the suitability of its affairs.\nThus the elder has the duty of supporting the orphaned,\nand the young boy also knows to carry the pitcher to provide nourishment.\"*\n\nThe eighth line:\n*\"Female affairs for males,\nten years without instruction.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Female affairs for males—\nthe household will never prosper.\"*\nThe *Fàn* edition reads *\"male and female affairs\"* (男女事), but we follow the *Song*, *Lǚ*, and *Wang* editions.\n**Wang** says:\n*\"Exceeding its proper measure,\nyet losing its place at night.\nContrary to the suitability of affairs,\nthis is a female substituting for male duties.\nTen years—\nthe extreme of numbers.\nWithout instruction—\nincorrigible.\"*\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"If a woman takes on male duties,\nthe household will not prosper;\nif a subject encroaches upon the ruler’s authority,\nthe state will not flourish.\nBeyond ten years,\nstrength and influence are already

stops,\nits affairs are steadfast.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Arriving at *ear-obedience*, it stops—\nhearing in reverse, acting in accord.\"*\n*Arrive* (到) is the same as *reverse* (倒).\n*Stop* (止) is the same as *foot* (趾).\nThe ninth line represents the end of calamity while in the day,\nable to accept loyal counsel and rectify faults,\nnot losing the proper order.\nLoyal words, though harsh to hear, benefit action;\ngood medicine, though bitter, benefits the ailment.\n\n*Completion of the Commentary on the Taixuan Jing, Volume Two.*\n\n「#28 *Lóng yě* (隆也) was originally incomplete; restored

dynasty scholars, *Guāng* for *Guāngyùn* 光尹).\n\nThe **Way** enters the **Array** in the fourth position, thirty-eight divisions and thirty-two seconds, the sun’s course truly sinks, and the **Summer Qi** responds.\n\nThe **Ladder** stands in the **Peril** position, the **Lü** pitch of the **Compass Bells** is central.\n\nThe **Array**, a regulated march. Though the **Yang Qi** dominates in its great activity, a subtle **Yin** rests below, the **Array** is formed yet desiring departure.\n\nLü says: The **Yin Qi** rests below, so the **Yang** is bound in the **Array**, its resolve set on departure.\n\nThe first day: A **Dark Array**, no visible march.\nMèng says: The **Dark Array** is unseen, the heart already straying outward.\nOne is the beginning of contemplation, yet it occurs in daylight.\nThe **Noble One**, perceiving subtleties, harbors a hidden resolve to depart, though none know it.\n\nThe second day: The **Wildfowl** are distressed upon the ice, winging toward the southern wind, inwardly cherishing their **Pairs**.\nMèng says: The **Wildfowl’s** distress is a burden of sorrow, finding no comfort.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lü* readings render *惨* as *掺*, but now follow the *Fàn* and *Wáng* readings.\n**Pairs**, pronounced *shí-líng* or *shí-líng* (variant).\nWáng says: **Wildfowl**, meaning **Geese**. Having lost their companions, they are distressed by the cold ice, then wing toward the southern wind, inwardly cherishing their **Pairs**, sorrowful yet finding no comfort.\n**Pairs** refers to the four **Geese** in flight.\nGuāng says: In *Fāngyán* (Regional Speech), flying birds are called **Pairs**, **Geese** are called **Pairs**—meaning **mates** or **companions**. **Geese** flee cold and seek warmth, migrating from north to south, just as people depart from danger to seek safety. The second day is the middle of contemplation, occurring at night.\nThe **Lesser One**, indulging in favor and wealth, cannot avoid calamity in its subtlety, like the **Goose** that inwardly cherishes its **Pairs** yet cannot journey far.\n\nThe *Yì* (Changes) says: **Bound Retreat** brings sickness—**Peril**.\n\nThe third day: **Advancing** in resolve, or **receiving** its joy.\nMèng says: **Advancing** in resolve meets what brings comfort.\nThe third day is the upper stage of contemplation, occurring in daylight.\nThough bound in travel, **advancing** fulfills its resolve, hence it **receives** its joy.\n\nThe fourth day: The **Black-Cock** flies at dawn, shattered in the north;\n**Ming-ming** they harmonize, yet never cease their feeding.\nMèng says: What reliance can the **Black-Cock’s** dawn flight have?\nThe *Sòng* and *Lü* readings render *踤* as *夸*, while *Wáng* renders it as *跨*; now follow the *Fàn* reading.\n**Black-Cock**, same as *鹍*, pronounced *gǔ-hún*.\n**Tread**, same as *萃*, also pronounced *cí-xù*.\nWáng says: The great **Crow** flies at dawn, yet it should have sought the **Yang** for its own safety.\nInstead, it reverses toward the north, losing its direction.\nThough they harmonize with **ming-ming**, they never abandon their intent to feed.\nHaving lost its **Way**, what benefit can it find?\n\nThe fifth day: The **Great Wildfowl** is bound in **Zī** (variant: *Zhī*),\nFeasting with **yí-yí** contentment.\nMèng says: The **Great Wildfowl** bound in **Zī** signifies a great commander achieving its resolve.\n\nThe sixth day: Passing through six **Crossroads**, circling nine **Paths**, yet no restraint on its **Marching Merchants**.\nMèng says: Passing through six **Crossroads** is the affair of **Merchants**.\nWáng says: Six **Crossroads**, nine **Paths**—there is no place it does not traverse.\nThose who labor yet seek profit are the peculiar affairs of the **Lesser Ones**.\nGuāng says: Six signifies abundance and multiplicity, occurring at night.\nThe **Lesser Ones** wander throughout the land, with no restraint on their movement, not for the sake of the **Way**.\nTheir resolve is merely to pursue profit, differing in no way from **Merchants**.\n\nThe seventh day: The **Array** lacks **Pairs**,\nProfit in **Campaigning**—**Fault**.\nMèng says: The **Array** lacks **Pairs**, calamity is near.\nThe *Sòng*, *Lü*, and *Wáng* readings render *离* as *lì*, but now follow the *Fàn* and minor *Sòng* readings.\n**Pairs**, same as *俪*, pronounced *lì*.\nThe eighth day: The **Late Middle** scatters its **Tracks**, weeping upon the **Path**, its journey sent forth.\n\nMèng says: The **Late Middle** scatters its **Tracks**, sending it to its death.\nThe *Fàn* and *Wáng* readings render *泣于之道* as *泣于道*; now follow the *Sòng* and *Lü* readings.\n\nThe ninth day: The **Array** is bound at **Dusk**.\n\nThe **Array** at **Dusk**—still may be avoided.\n\nThe **King** says: In the **Way** of the **Array**, one should act first.\nNow occupying the extreme position, it has lost the **Way** of avoiding difficulty.\nYet, when in position at **Day**, like one preparing to avoid calamity in the murky hour,\nthough late, it may still be avoided.\n\n**Guāng** says: Nine marks the end of calamity, yet it is at **Day**.\nThe **Noble One**, when encountering the extremity of calamity,\nprepares and departs—though the time is late, it is better than lingering in ease and not leaving.\n\n**Two Regions, One Province, Two Prefectures, Two Families, the Multitude**\n**Yin-Family Earth**, following the **Master**.\n\nEntering the Multitude, the fourth day: **Day-Rest** at *Zhuì* and *Zhì*.\nThe eighth day: **Day-Rest** at *Shēn*.\n\n**Yang-qi** is indeed lofty, the **Heart** harmonized—\nAll things flourish and expand, the Multitude is vast.\n*Shēn*, same as *shēn* (to extend).\n*Mǎo*, pronounced *hù* (to adorn).\n**Lü** says: *Mǎo*, beautiful appearance.\n\nThe first day: **Dark Soldiers** begin—**Fire** enters the **Ear**.\nFarming ceases, the **Grain-Valley** is abandoned;\nThe **Corpse** will be arrayed upon the **Field**.\n\n**Mèng** says: The beginning of **Dark Soldiers**—\nAt its start, it is not yet preserved.\n\nThe **King’s** text renders *毅* as *gǔ* (wheel), now following all other readings.\n\nThe **King** says: *Bān*, to deploy.\n\n**Guāng** says: One, with its obscurity, marks the beginning of **Soldiers**—\nThe onset of war has already sprouted, yet it has not yet taken form, hence \"the beginning of **Dark Soldiers**.\"\nFor **Soldiers** are an inauspicious instrument—\nWhen people hear of them, they are startled and alarmed, hence \"the **Fire** enters the **Ear**.\"\nFarming halts its plowing, to provide provisions and supplies.\nFeeding the **Horse** with *yì* (strength), for the **General’s** use.\n\nThe **Corpse** arrayed upon the **Field**—\nThis speaks of many dead.\n\nThe second hexagram:\n**Soldiers** without blades,\nThe army without formation,\nThe **Lynx** comes as a guest—**gentleness**.\n\n**Mèng** says: **Soldiers** without blades—\nTheir **virtue/power** subdues without measure.\n\nThe **King** renders *麟* as *lín* (neighbor), now following all other readings.\n*陈* (formation) is pronounced *zhèn* (straight blade).\n\n**Fàn** says: The **Lynx** is a beast,\nWith horns that do not strike.\n\nThe **King** says: The second hexagram resides in the lower body’s center,\nYet also holds the position of day.\nIt gains the favor of the multitude,\nThus **Soldiers** do not clash blades,\nThe army does not set formations,\nYet strong neighboring enemy states come as guests.\n\n**Guāng** says: The second hexagram is the midpoint of **Thought**,\nAnd aligns with day.\nThe **Noble** cultivates **virtue/power** in the heart,\nAnd all under heaven submit in turn—\n**Soldiers** have no need to strike,\nThus the army has no need of formation.\n*Guests* are those who come from without.\nThe **Lynx** comes as a guest—\nSymbolizing martial might yet unused.\n*Gentleness* means no harsh coercion.\n\nThe third hexagram:\nThe army laden with carts,\nThe elder crushes his kin,\nWithin, he treads upon the **Flaw**.\n\n**Mèng** says: The army laden with carts—\nTemple battles, internal wounds.\n\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** readings render *丈* as *dà* (great) and *孥* as *nú* (crossbow),\nThe **King** renders *摧* as *tuī* (push) and *孥* as *nú* (slave).\nNow all follow **Fàn’s** readings.\n\nThe third hexagram marks the end of **Thought**.\nBefore battle, internal scheming has already begun.\nCarts are bound and entangled,\nOverturning what they bear.\nThe *elder* is the head of the household.\n*Kin* refers to wife and children.\nPlanning proves as flawed as the elder’s own self-destruction.\nDefeat comes not from without—\nIt stems from internal discord already sown,\nThus the enemy gains the advantage.\n\n**Sūnzǐ** says: To lose before battle, in temple calculations,\nIs to lack foresight.\n\nThe fourth hexagram:\nThe **Tiger** roars, shaking the hall,\nThe **Leopard** subdues its private passions—**restraint**.\n\n**Mèng** says: The **Tiger** roars, shaking the hall,\nLike an eagle taking flight.\nThe **King** renders *胜* as *téng* (soar), now following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** readings.\nThe **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** readings render *私* as *mì* (secret), now following the **King’s** reading.\n*虓* is pronounced *xiāo* (angry cry).\n*振廞* is pronounced *zhènyīn* (stirring).\n*否* is pronounced *pǐ* (blocked).\n\n**Fàn** says: *虓* is the sound of rage.\n*Shaking the hall* depicts extreme fury.\n\nThe **King** says: Positioned among the multitude yet near the honored seat,\nThis is the duty of generalship.\nHolding the position of day,\nSkilled in leading the masses,\nLike the **Tiger’s** roar, stirring and rising.\n**Guāng** says: The fourth hexagram is the lower **Luck** in position—\nOne who wields the multitude.\nThe **Tiger** and **Leopard**, both symbols of martial ferocity.\nThough the warrior rages like a **Tiger**,\nHis might is tempered like an eagle’s flight.\nYet he does not use force to settle disputes or vent anger,\nMastering his private desires,\nThus he may be used yet remains unused.\n*The Law of Speech* says:\n*\"Asked of martial virtue, it was answered: ‘Conquest.’*\nTo conquer one’s private heart is called conquest.\"\n\nThe fifth hexagram:\n**Drums** clash *jiējiē*,\nLike **Bear** or **Dragon**.\n**Mèng** says: **Drums** clash *jiējiē*—\nRelying on strength to rule.\n*躆* (drum) is the same as *踞* (sit), should read *剧* (excessive).\nThe fifth hexagram resides in the peak position yet aligns with night,\nRelying on strength for victory—\nThis is insufficient to subdue all under heaven.\n\nThe sixth hexagram:\nGreat **Soldiers** like thunder and lightning,\nShaking the ears,\nYet bend to fill the belly—**submission**.\n\n**Mèng** says: Great **Soldiers** like thunder and lightning—\nTheir awe-inspiring might knows no bounds.\nThe **King** renders *维* as *hòu* (await), now following all other readings.\n*诎* is the same as *屈* (yield).\n\n「Submission of the belly—\nThis is akin to submitting one’s heart.\n\nThe sixth hexagram reaches its greatest height while corresponding to day.\nThe **King’s** armies do not seek to slaughter and maim;\nThey merely instill dread.\nThus, like thunder and lightning,\nThey strike with awe-inspiring might,\nForcing hearts to submit.\nThe *Shijing* [Classic of Poetry] states:\n*\"The lands of Xu tremble in fear,\nLike thunder, like lightning—\nThe lands of Xu tremble in fear.\"*\n\nThe *Baihu Tong* [White Tiger's Discourse] says:\n*\"War is to instill dread.\"*\n\nThe seventh hexagram:\n**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray,\n**Weapons** clash with a sinister din.\nThe **army** is burdened with grief,\nWeeping and sighing.\n**Mèng** says:\n**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray—\nThis reflects the people’s deep resentment.\nThe *Fan* and *Wang* readings of *dry* (钺) as *ge* (戈) are now corrected to follow the *Song* and *Lu* readings.\n*絓* (flutter) is pronounced as in *Hù* (户).\n*唁* (weeping) is pronounced *Yàn* (彦).\n*Sighing* is pronounced *Mòjiā* (莫佳).\n**Fan** says:\n*\"To mourn the living is called *yàn* (唁), and to peer secretly is called *mòjiā* (窃视称 ).\"*\n**Guang** states:\n*\"The seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity while corresponding to night,\nA sign of the army’s defeat and ruin.\n**Banners** and **flags** flutter in disarray,\n**Weapons** clash with a sinister din—\nThis depicts the chaos of defeat.\nThe **army** represents the multitude.\nWhen a husband dies and a wife is pregnant,\nThe people’s sorrow is most acute.\nThe multitude weeping in mourning,\nBoth crying and peering secretly at their rulers,\nExpress their resentment and hatred.\"*\n\nThe eighth hexagram:\nThe **army** grows weary,\n**Victory** is seen in sickness,\nNot in corpses or fallen chariots.\n**Mèng** says:\n*\"The **army** grows weary—\nThis means no bloodshed is required.\n*衰衰* (weary) depicts exhaustion and decline.\nThe eighth hexagram signifies **stagnant illness**, **consumption**, **peeling away**, and **calamity within**,\nYet corresponds to day.\nIt represents the ability to exhaust and weaken an enemy state,\nBending their strength without battle.\"*\n\nThe ninth hexagram:\n**Axe-blades** are chipped,\nTheir handles broken—\nThey can halt, but cannot strike.\n**Blood** is shed.\n**Mèng** says:\n*\"Chipped blades and broken handles—\nThe **army** is ill-equipped to advance.\n**Wang** says:\n*\"To advance will only bring self-inflicted bloodshed.\"*\n**Guang** states:\n*\"The ninth hexagram marks the extreme of military use,\nThe culmination of misfortune—\nPursuing war without knowing when to stop.\"*\"\n\n*\"Two lands, one state, two departments, three families—**sealed**,\nThe **Yang Family’s** water, **measured**.\"*\n\nThe ninth hexagram:\n**Sealed** is **measured**—\nThe **Way** of the **Yang Family’s** water.\n\n*\"**Sealed** means **comparison** and **proximity**, as well as **completeness** and **perfection**.\n**Yang qi** is close to Heaven, all things flourish and thrive—\nEverything is **sealed** without gaps.\n**Wang** originally wrote *caì* (咸) as *shèng* (盛), but now follows other scholars.\n**Wang** says:\n*'Flourish and thrive'—a description of greatness.\nAll things, riding the **Yang qi**, are great and perfect—\n**Completeness** and **perfection** without flaw.\n**Guang** states:\n*'**Yang qi** ascends and is close to Heaven—\nThe utmost height.'*\n\n*First line: Peering without gaps—\nThe gateway to great obscurity.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'Peering without gaps—\n**Sealed** without direction.'*\n**Sòng** states:\n*'All matters are **sealed**, hence the description of \"without direction.\"'*\n**Guang** says:\n*'The first line marks the beginning of contemplation,\nAnd corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous one focuses their mind on **sealed** matters,\nTo establish deeds and secure achievements—\nNo one can peer into their intentions.'*\nThe *Yì* says: *\"If even minor matters are not **sealed**, then harm will arise.\"*#\n\n*Second line: Neither **sealed** nor **comparison**,\nYet my heart is merely **traveling**.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'Neither **sealed** nor **comparison**—\nThis is to stray from one’s native place.'*\n**Comparison** (比) is pronounced *bǐ* (频寐切).\nThe virtuous one loves what is near to embrace what is distant,\nWhile the petty one does the opposite.\nThe second line marks the middle of contemplation,\nAnd corresponds to night.\nUnable to embrace what is near,\nYet laboring their heart for what is distant.\n**Traveling** (次) means to lodge at an inn.\nTo stray from one’s native place,\nYet seek to lodge at an inn—\nThis is abandoning what is near for what is distant.*\nThe *Shī* says:\n*\"No fields of my own, only weeds flourishing—\nThe distant, unthought-of, weigh heavy on my heart.\"*\n\n*Third line: **Sealed** in what is close,\nBeneficial for nurturing others.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'**Sealed** in what is close—\nThis is the ultimate benefit.'*\nThe third line marks the upper stage of contemplation,\nAnd corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous one loves their own kin,\nAnd thus knows how to love others’ kin—\nExtending their heart to include all,\nHence it is said: \"Beneficial for nurturing others.\"*\n\n*Fourth line: **Sealed** in what is foul and turbulent,\nThree days without tasting the **soup**—*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'**Sealed** in what is foul and rank—\nThis is the passage of minor evils.'*\n**Wang** says:\n*'**Sealed** in what is foul and rank—\nThis is the **virtue/power** of embracing what is evil.'*\n**Guang** states:\n*'The fourth line marks external lodging and corresponds to night—\nThis is the one who associates with those who are not virtuous.\nAssociating with those who are not virtuous,\nOver time, one will transform into them.\nConfucius said:\n*\"To dwell with those who are not virtuous,\nIs like entering a fishmonger’s stall—\nIf one stays long without noticing the stench,\nThey will come to regard it as their own.\nMinor evils, if not removed,\nWill gradually become familiar,\nAnd one will eventually align with them.*\n**Soup** (殽) is a mixture of flavors.\n**Lodging** (次) means to lodge at an inn.*\n\n*Fifth line: **Sealed** and **measured** without flaw,\nIn harmony with Heaven.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'**Sealed** and **measured** without **altar**—\nThis is to merge with Heaven’s function.'*\n**Crack** (罅) is pronounced *xià* (呼嫁切).\n**Harmony** (嫔) is pronounced *pín* (频).\n**Wang** says:\n*'Residing in the center with uprightness,\nObtaining their proper position and corresponding to day.\nAs a wise ruler in their time,\nThey embrace what is truly close.\nHence it is said: \"**Sealed** and **measured** without flaw\"—\nThis means without gaps.\nThus, their achievements align with Heaven’s.'*\n**Guang** states:\n*'\"**Sealed** and **measured** without flaw\"—\nThe ruler

with great evil—\nThis is to match opposites.*\nThe sixth line marks the end of fortune and nearing misfortune,\nHence they **compare** with great evil,\nAnd perhaps it will bring added sorrow.\nThose not of my kind,\nTheir hearts must differ.\nMatching with opposites,\nOnly invites self-inflicted burden.*\nThe *Yì* says: *\"**Comparison** with those who are not of one’s kind.\"*\n\n*Seventh line: **Sealed** with a small mouth and **gills**,\nThe great ruler has no successor.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'**Sealed** with a small mouth and **gills**—\nThis is relying on the ruler’s reach.'*\n**Wang** originally omitted the *wú* (无) character,\nWhile **Xiǎo Sòng** omitted it as *qí* (其).\nNow follows the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Fàn** versions.\n**Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions have *féng* (逢) instead of *dá* (达),\nBut now follows the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Wang** versions.\n**Gills** (鳃) is pronounced *sāi* (苏来切).\n**Ruler** (君) means to lodge at an inn (次),*\n*And the eighth line is entered.\nAt **16° 7'**, the **qi** of **Great Fullness** responds.*\n\n*Those who are **close**—\nThis means mutual love and deep affection.\nThe **Yang** side embodies **ren** (仁) and

**Close** not to their own flesh,\nTheir intentions are **clashing**.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*'**Close** not to their own flesh—\nThis is a heart at ease.'*\n**Wang** originally omitted the *qīn* (亲) character,\nNow follows the **Èr Sòng**, **Lǚ**, **Fàn**, and **Ràng** versions.\n**Wang** says:\n*'At the beginning of **closeness**, yet losing their proper position and corresponding to night,\nThis is straying from the **Way** of **closeness**.\nNot their own flesh—\nThis refers to those who are distant,\nNot truly **close** in flesh and blood,\nYet are **close** to them—\nTheir intentions will **clash**,\nAnd not align.\nTheir hearts are mutually guarded,\nStraying from the **Way** of **closeness**.\n**Guang** states:\n*'The first line marks the beginning of

intervene.'*\n**Fàn** version has *ròu* (肉) instead of *nèi* (内),\nAnd *wén* (闻) instead of *jiàn* (间);\n**Wang** version has *ròu* (肉) instead of *nèi* (内),\nAnd *xián* (闲) instead of *jiàn* (间);\nNow follows the **Sòng** and **Lǚ** versions.\n**Wang** says:\n*'**Close** to **affection** (戚)—\nThis is to take (资) what is **close**.\nTheir intentions are solely taken from what is **close** and attached.*\n**Guang** states:\n*'The second line marks the middle of contemplation,\nAnd corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous one embodies sincerity in deep **closeness**,\nHence it is said: \"Trust within.\"*\n\nNext follows the third hexagram:\n\n**Third line:**\nThe silkworm moth’s offspring belong not to it,\nYet the mantis takes them—\nNo resistance is met.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*The silkworm moth’s offspring belong not to it—\nIt has lost its own body.*\n\nThe **Wang** version reads *\"no resistance is met\"* as *\"蠃侮\"* (shāng wǔ), now following the **Sòng**, **Lǚ**, and **Fàn** versions.\n\n**Phonetic glosses:**\n*蜾* (guǒ), *蠃* (láng guǒ), *螟* (míng), *蛉* (líng), *属* (zhī yù).\n*The silkworm moth* refers to the silkworm’s larvae.\n*The mantis* is the *Chuánlú* insect.\n*属* means \"to attach.\"\n*近侮* is akin to \"warding off insult.\"\n\nThe third line marks the end of contemplation,\nAnd corresponds to night.\nThe petty person cannot attach to their kin\nTo ward off external threats,\nThus causing estrangement and aligning with others.\nLike the silkworm moth failing to raise its own young,\nOnly to have them taken by the mantis.\n\nAs the *Shī* says:\n*The silkworm moth’s offspring,*\n*The mantis carries them away.*\nTeach your children well,\nAnd let them emulate this.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth line:**\nGuests are honored with propriety,\nFeasts are measured and orderly.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*Guests are honored with propriety—\nHost and guest unite in harmony.*\n\n**Wang** says:\n*几几* (jī jī) means \"ordered by law.\"\n\n**Guang** states:\nThe fourth line marks flourishing clarity,\nAnd corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous one uses ceremonial feasting\nTo foster bonds of kinship and affection.\nGuests are honored not for the food,\nBut because propriety is observed.\nConfucius said:\n*\"I ate at the home of Shàoshī,*\n*And was filled.*\n*Shàoshī fed me with propriety.\"*\n\nHost and guest unite—\nBoth act with decorum.\n\n---\n\n**Fifth line:**\nGenerosity without substance,\nThose who cling will flee.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*Generosity without substance—\nIt lacks kindred and direction.*\n\n**Wang** says:\nThough the fifth line is central,\nIt is misplaced and corresponds to night.\nWhen generosity should be given but is not,\nThose who cling to it will abandon it.\n**Guang** states:\nUnable to honor those who should be honored,\nOr to show generosity where it is due,\nIt drives away those who are near,\nLeaving one isolated and perilous.\nAs **Zǐ Tàishū** said:\n*\"Jìn is no longer a neighbor—*\n*Who would say otherwise?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Sixth line:**\nGenerosity in generosity,\nThe virtuous one wields the Dipper.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*The virtuous one’s generosity—\nBoundless in gathering people.*\n\nThe sixth line marks abundance and corresponds to day,\nFor it honors those who should be honored\nAnd shows generosity where it is due.\nThe virtuous one enriches the near and draws the distant,\nNurtures the close and attracts the distant.\nLike the Dipper at the center,\nWith all stars revolving around it,\nThus it is said: *The virtuous one wields the Dipper.*\n\n---\n\n**Seventh line:**\nLofty in station, yet trivial in deeds,\nBase in execution.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*Lofty in station, base in deeds—\nVirtue cannot sustain it.*\n\nThe **Sòng** and **Lǚ** versions read *\"周\"* (zhōu) for *\"从\"* (cóng),\nWhile the **Fàn** version reads *\"同\"* (tóng).\nNow following the **Wang** version.\n\n*庳* (bì) is pronounced *\"便是\"* (biàn shì) or *\"必至\"* (bì zhì), also *\"卑\"* (bēi).\n\n**Wang** says:\nThe seventh line occupies an overfull position,\nMisplaced and corresponding to night,\nThough its station is lofty,\nIts actions are trivial and base.\n\n---\n\n**Eighth line:**\nDried meat clings to the bundle,\nYet the resentment has already formed—\nThe virtuous one departs.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*The clinging of dried meat—\nIt lacks my worth.*\n\nThe **Sòng** and **Wang** versions read *\"脯\"* (fǔ) for *\"肺\"* (fèi),\n*\"乾\"* (qián) for *\"干\"* (gān),\nAnd *\"往\"* (wǎng) for *\"行\"* (xíng).\nThe **Wang** version reads *\"腑\"* (fǔ) for *\"附\"* (fù).\nNow following the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions.\n\n*糇* (hóu).\n**Fàn** says: *\"削\"* (xuē) is *\"肺\"* (fèi).\n*肺附* is like the lung clinging to wood.\n**Wang** says:\nThough there is the clinging of dried meat as kin,\nThe resentment of the bundle has already formed—\nThus the virtuous one departs.\n\nAs the *Shī* says:\n*The people’s loss of virtue,*\n*The bundle’s resentment grows.*\n\n**Guang** states:\n*肺附* illustrates how kin cling to their clan leader.\nThough the people are humble,\nThey should still share the *jiān hóu* (dried meat and grain)\nTo aid their kin.\nThe clinging of dried meat is the thinnest of bonds,\nYet even this should be honored with provisions—\nHow much more so when the resentment is justified?\nThis is why **Wēizǐ** returned to **Zhōu**.\n\n---\n\n**Ninth line (topmost):**\nYouthful kin are unfaithful.\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*Youthful kin are unfaithful—\nThey revert to their roots.*\n\n**Sòng** says: *\"荄\"* (zhì) means *\"exhausting one’s roots.\"*\n\n**Wang** says:\nAt the extreme of kinship,\nMisplaced and corresponding to night,\nLike the foolish and senile,\nThose they are close to will never be upright.\n\n---\n**Appendix:**\nTwo regions, one state, three departments, two families—\n**Yáng** family, **Mù** (wood).\n\nThe **Yáng**-qi (阳气) is fully manifest in the external,\nWhile the subtle **Yīn** (阴) is gathered inward.\n\n**Lù** says:\n*\"The subtle **Yīn** is gathered inward, exhausting the roots of all things.\"*\n\n**Initial One (初一):**\n*Small gathering without remission,*\n*Favorable for governing and stabilizing the people, rectifying the state.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Small gathering without remission—*\n*This is the proper **Dao/Way** (道).*\n*Remission* (贷), *read as \"huò\"* (货, *tǔ dé* cut).\n\nFrom **One** to **Three** (三),\n*Subtle and yet to take root,*\n*Hence all bear the image of smallness.*\n**One** (初一) corresponds to the *stroke of day* (日之画),\n*Where the noble one practices modest gathering with constancy,*\n*Not burdening the people with remission of taxes,*\n*Thus favorable for governing and stabilizing the people, rectifying the state.*\n**One** (初一) also says:\n*\"Remission\"* (贷) should be read as *\"huò\"* (货, *tǔ dé* cut).\n\n**Second (次二):**\n*Blackened gathering, ever so slight,*\n*I am not upright.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Blackened gathering, ever so slight—*\n*This is not for illumination.*\n*Xiao Song* (小宋) originally read *截* (jié) for *铁* (tiě), while *Wang* (王) read *寝* (qǐn).\n*Now following Song, Lu, and Fan* (范), we read *铁* (tiě).\n*铁* (tiě), *read as \"xī lián\"* (息廉).\n**Fàn** (范) says:\n*铁铁* (tiě tiě), *means \"slight\" or \"small.\"*\n*Illumination* (光) refers to:\n*Blackened* (墨) means *greed* (贪).\nThe petty one is greedy in gathering,\nTaking delight in trifling gains,\nGradually descending into what is not upright—\nThis is not the way to bring forth illumination and beauty.\n\n**Third (次三):**\n*Seeing smallness, do not use it,*\n*With me, to nurture the sparse.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Seeing smallness, do not use it,*\n*Await my fullness.*\n**Wáng** (王) says:\n*Three* (次三) *holds its proper position at midday,*\n*Fitting for the gathering of **Yīn** (阴).*\n*Seeing smallness, do not use it—*\n*This is because with me, the growth is flourishing,*\n*Thus reaching the stage of nurturing and spreading vastness.*\n*Illumination* (光) says:\n*When things are yet subtle and small,*\n*The noble one cultivates them,*\n*Awaiting their fullness,*\n*And then takes them.*\n\nThe *Rites* (礼) state:\n*\"Do not pluck, do not break eggs, do not kill the fetus,\nNor cut down the young—*\n*Grass and trees must first wither and fall,*\n*Then one may enter the mountains and forests.*\n*All this is of the same intent.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Fourth (次四):**\n*Gathering profit with minor punishments,*\n*Small advances, great withdrawals.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Gathering profit with minor punishments—*\n*This is because governance is in retreat.*\n\n*(The text of) the *Rites* (政) is established as correct,*\n*Now following the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng editions.*\n\n**Fifth (次五):**\n*Store the **Yīn** (阴) and spread it forth,*\n*The cocoon’s purity in the fields.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Store the **Yīn** (阴) and nurture its purity—*\n*This is to avoid disrupting the seasons.*\n\n**Yīn** (阴) is *joy* (乐).\n**Purity** (纯) is *beauty* (美).\nFifth (五) is the stage of the cocoon,\nAnd it holds the position of *flourishing* (盛) while corresponding to *drawing* (画).\n\n*(The Way) does not act in haste,*\n*Life is born at its proper time,*\n*Its use is measured with moderation—*\n*Thus the six livestock thrive and multiply,*\n*And the silkworms yield abundant beauty.*\n\n**Sixth (次六):**\n*Lamenting and extending, yet failing to heed,*\n*Creating great beginnings—*\n*The petty man does not guard against ruin.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*The warning of lamenting and extending—*\n*This is because he does not recognize subtleties.*\n\n*(The Wáng edition reads) \"Lamenting and extending, yet failing to heed,\"*\n*Now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.*\n\n**Lamenting** (闵) and **extending** (绵) are minor appearances.\n**Beginning** (元) is *origin* (始).\nSixth (六) is in the gathering phase,\nExceeding the midpoint and corresponding to night—\n*The harbinger of resentment.*\n\nResentment begins in small things,\nYet grows to great.\nThe petty man does not guard against ruin,\nThus resentment reaches him,\nAnd he does not even realize it.\n\n**Seventh (次七):**\n*The husband is drawn to the chariot,*\n*The wife becomes the stripper of **chá** (茶),*\n*Profit for the king’s sisters,*\n*Not for the public realm—*\n*This is perilous.*\n\n**Mèng** says:\n*Drawn to the chariot, stripping **chá** (茶)—*\n*These are the means of gathering profit.*\n\n**Lù** says:\n*Means* (资) *is* ***wealth** (财).\n\n*The husband and wife gather wealth,*\n*Profit for the household, not for the state.*\n\n**Wáng** says:\n*Drawn to the chariot* (牵于车) *is heavy labor with meager gain;*\n*Stripping **chá** (茶)* (剥荼) *is bitter herbs with little reward.*\n*It can suffice for private chambers,*\n*Profit for the king’s sisters,*\n*Yet is insufficient to support the public realm.*\n\n**Light** (光) says:\n*The *Ěryǎ* (尔雅) states that the sisters of the king’s father are called *king’s sisters* (王姑).*\n\n**Eighth (次八):**\n*Great gathering, great reversal.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*The reversal of great gathering—*\n*The gathered profits are not right.*\n\n*(The Lù, Fàn, and Wáng editions read) \"reversal\" (颠) as \"peak\" (巅),*\n*Now following the two Sòng editions.*\n\n**Wáng** says:\n*Eighth (八) resides at the extreme of gathering,*\n*Yet loses its proper position, corresponding to night—*\n*The stage of great gathering.*\n*Amidst calamity,*\n*To seek great gathering,*\n*One must surely face the disaster of reversal and collapse.*\n\n**Ninth (上九):**\n*Gathering at the proper time,*\n*Profit in guarding against extreme calamity.*\n**Mèng** says:\n*Gathering at the proper time—*\n*How can this be criticized?*\n\n**Wáng** says:\n*Guarding* (圉) *is the same as* ***driving/warding** (御).\n\n**Light** (光) says:\n*Ninth (九) is the stage of extreme calamity,*\n*Yet corresponds to midday.*\n*The noble one, in times of abundance,*\n*Implements heavy gathering—*\n*The people do not regard it as tyranny,*\n*This is how one prepares in advance for years of famine,*\n*And wards off this extreme disaster.*\n\n*(Criticized* (几) *should be read as* ***mocked/reproached** (讥).\n\n*Though gathering is heavy,*\n*If done at the proper time,*\n*There is no reproach.*\n\nMencius condemns:\n*Dogs and pigs devouring human food yet unaware of restraint,*\n*And the land having starving corpses yet unaware of relief.*\n*In these two cases,*\n*One state, one district, three families—*\n*The **Yīn** (阴) family hoards gold,*\n*Following the *Kàn* (乾) family’s measure.*\n\nThe **Yáng** (陽) *qi* is pure and rigid, **Kàn** (乾) **Kàn** (乾).\nAll things are strong and flourishing#20.\n*(Range and Wang originally read* **chún** (純) *as*

*hour,*\n*Endures no warding.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*The phoenix bird takes flight—*\n*The noble one finds the proper time.*\n**Fàn** (范) says:\n*Warding* (圉) *is restraint.*\n**Guāng** (光) says:\n*The* **chén** (辰) *hour is the time.*\n**Two** (二) *is the middle of thought,*\n*And corresponds to day.*\n*The noble one finds the proper time,*\n*Strong in righteousness,*\n*None can

time.*\n\n**Third** (次) **three** (三), *The pillar does not align,*\n*The beam does not rise,*\n*The great hall is slight.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*The pillar does not align—*\n*It cannot establish a firm foundation.*\n**Three** (三) *resides at the head of the lower body,*\n*And bears the burden above,*\n*The likeness of the beam and pillar.*\n*At the night of day,*\n*The commoner is not strong

both sides.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*Then it is wise and clear—*\n*The ministers now come forward.*\n*(Song, Lu, and Wang originally read* **sāo** (搔) *as* **zhuā** (橿) *; Xiao Song as* **qiáng** (强) *; now following Fan’s reading.)*\n*(Wang originally read* **fāng** (方) *as* **yǒng** (永) *; now following other readings.)*\n**Fàn** (范) says:\n*Four* (四) *is in its course,*\n*The numbers of course mutually support.*\n**Xī** ( ) *is flourishing.*\n**Wáng** (王) says:\n*Xī* ( ) *is indeed the appearance of mutual support.*\n**Wú** (吴) says:\n*The character* **xī** ( ) *should be* **jiāng** (姜) *with the radical* **shǒu** (手) *; the character books have no such form, but with the radical* **mù** (木) *its sound is* **jiāng** (姜).*\n*Since* **four** (四) *is metal,*\n*And the metal family heads with metal,*\n*It is said that the numbers of course mutually support,*\n*Not taking* **qiáng** (强) *as support.*\n**Guāng** (光) says:\n*Four* (四) *is the likeness of unobstructed flow,*\n*And corresponds to day.*\n*The noble one possesses the virtue of wisdom and clarity,*\n*Hence the ministers now come forward,*\n*Assisting on both sides,*\n*Thus making it strong.*\n\n**Fifth** (次) **five** (五), *The noble one is strong and flourishing by virtue#22,*\n*The commoner is strong and flourishing by force#23.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*The commoner is strong and flourishing#24—*\n*Finding position brings even greater fault.*\n**Wáng** (王) says:\n*Five* (五) *resides in the ruler’s position,*\n*Yet loses the proper time, corresponding to night.*\n*Without the ruler’s virtue,*\n*It is the commoner’s strength and flourishing#25.*\n*Strong and flourishing by force#26,*\n*It must bring about* **diān** (颠) *and peril.*\n\n**Sixth** (次) **six** (六), *Conquering my strength and flourishing,*\n*With Heaven, it knows no bounds#28.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*Conquering my strength and flourishing—*\n*The great beauty lacks foundation.*\n*(Wang originally read* **wú jī** (无基) *as* **wú jiāng** (无疆) *; now following Song, Lu, and Fan’s readings.)*\n**Sòng** (宋) says:\n*Without foundation—*\n*It means without boundaries,*\n*Speaking of vastness and remoteness.*\n**Wáng** (王) says:\n*Six* (六) *is strength,*\n*The master of finding position, corresponding to day.*\n*If it can conquer strength and flourishing,*\n*And fortify its own virtue,*\n*Then the ruler’s way grows ever brighter,*\n*Hence reaching Heaven with no end.*\n**Guāng** (光) says:\n*From five onward, it is* **xiāo** (消) *;*\n*Six exceeds the middle yet corresponds to day.*\n*The noble one can harmonize with the times,*\n*Conquering its own strength,*\n*Thus attaining vast blessings,*\n*And knowing no bounds with Heaven#32.*\n\n**Seventh** (次) **seven** (七), *Metal is rigid, flesh is soft,*\n*Blood flows in the fields.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*Metal is rigid, flesh is soft—*\n*The law is too severe.*\n*(Wang originally omitted the character* **liú** (流) *; now following other readings.)*\n**Seven** (七) *is ruin and loss,*\n*And corresponds to night.*\n*The commoner applies the law too severely,*\n*Severing soft flesh with rigid metal—*\n*None can resist it.*\n*Blood flows in the fields,*\n*The extreme of cruelty#33.*\n\n**Eighth** (次) **eight** (八), *Strengthen its decline,*\n*Encourage its weakness.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*Strengthen its decline—*\n*It strives to strengthen itself.*\n**Eight** (八) *is illness and stagnation,*\n*And corresponds to day.*\n*The noble one can strengthen decline and encourage weakness,*\n*Not sinking into ruin itself.*\n**Upper nine** (上九), *Great mountain uprooted,*\n*The beam and pillar broken,*\n*Its person is* **diān** (颠) *and* **jué** (蹶) *.*\n**Zhè** (测) says:\n*The mountain uprooted, the beam broken—*\n*It ends in ferocity.*\n*(Wang originally read* **tài shān bá** (太山拔) *as* **dà zhī bá** (大枝拔) *; now following other readings.)*\n**Wáng** (王) says:\n*At the extreme of strength,*\n*Yet losing position,

(Zhuàn), same as **粹** (cuì).\n**Lù** (陆) says: *乾* (Kàn) is pure.\n**粹** (cuì) is refined. The **yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) is **zhuàn** (袀) and **zhuàn** (睟) in purity and clarity, all things flourish in radiance, preserving their resplendent **yáng** (阳).\n*(Wang originally read **zhuàn** (袀) as **chū** (初), now following other readings.)*\n**袀** (zhuàn), same as **jūn** (均).\n**Sòng** (宋) says: *保* (bǎo) means to secure.\nAt this time, the **yīn** (阴) *qi* (气) withdraws and hides below, while the **yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) is **zhuàn** (袀) and **zhuàn** (睟) in purity and clarity. Thus, all things—whether high or low—flourish in radiance, securing their vitality, and embody their **yáng** (阳) *virtue/power* (德).\n\n**Lù** (陆) says: *袀睟* (zhuàn zhuàn), akin to *pure and refined* (纯粹).\n\n**First line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) within, pure without blemish.\n**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) within, pure without blemish.\nOne signifies the beginning of thought, and corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous person maintains purity and refinement in heart, clear and unadulterated, thus able to gather all principles and accomplish myriad tasks.\n\n**Second line**, *dim and impure* (冥驳) *concealing* (冒) *睟* (Zhuàn), within.\n**Zhè** (测) says: *冥驳冒睟* (dim and impure concealing refinement), internally flawed.\n**Zhuì** (瘱), pronounced as *yú jì* (於计).\n**Zhuì** (瘱), pronounced as *yú jì* (於计).\n**Lù** (陆) says: *瘱* (Zhuì) means to hide.\n**Fàn** (范) says: *瘱* (Zhuì) means shame.\n**驳** (Bó) means impure.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The second line signifies thought in its middle, yet corresponding to night.\nThe petty person, amidst dimness and obscurity, conceals impure and mixed thoughts—though outwardly they may deceive others, their heart remains inwardly ashamed.\n\n**Third line**, *eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss, reverent* (恭).\n**Zhè** (测) says: *目上耳下* (eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss), the peak of insight and discernment.\n*(Wang originally omitted the word *恭* (reverent), now following other readings.)*\nThe third line signifies thought at its end, yet still corresponding to day.\nThe virtuous person’s thoughts, if pure and refined, attain boundless clarity—*eyes raised to heaven, ears lowered to the abyss*. Though they do not rely on this, they remain solemn and vigilant, thus preserving their refinement.\n\n**Fourth line**, petty persons *covet* (慕) *睟* (Zhuàn), yet lose their *luck and uprightness* (禄贞).\n**Zhè** (测) says: Petty persons *covet* (慕) *睟* (Zhuàn), yet fail to attain it.\n**Wáng** (王) says: Losing position and corresponding to night, their path is already impure.\nThough they covet the pure and refined Dao, they lose their fortune, uprightness, and integrity.\n\n**Fifth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) in the *mysterious yellow* (幽黄), *uprightness and origin* (元贞) without measure.\n**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) in the *mysterious yellow* (幽黄), the true and just principle.\n**Lù** (陆) says: *则* (Zé) means law.\n**Wáng** (王) says: Dwelling in the center and embodying uprightness, attaining position corresponding to day, this is the master of *睟* (Zhuàn).\nPure and great virtue shining clear, *睟* (Zhuàn) in the mysterious depths, yet bearing the *yellow center’s* (黄中) harmonizing principle. The origin and uprightness are boundless, their Dao without measure, ineffable.\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: *元* (yuán) is the longest of the good.\nThe fifth line signifies *central harmony* (中和), yet still corresponding to day.\nThe virtuous person, though hidden, does not lose the Dao of central harmony—thus they are refined. Guarding their origin and uprightness, they respond to all tasks without fail.\nLike the earth’s virtue, it too completes all things through mysterious yellow, origin, and uprightness.\n\n**Sixth line**, *great* (大) *睟* (Zhuàn) *bears* (承) *faults* (愆), *perilous* (易).\n**Zhè** (测) says: *大睟承愆* (great refinement bears faults), the petty person cannot preserve it.\n*(Wang originally read: Great refinement bears faults, the petty person cannot preserve it. Zhè says: The Dao of great refinement, the petty person cannot preserve it. Now following other readings.)*\n**Wáng** (王) says: The sixth line dwells in a position of excess, the greatest of *睟* (Zhuàn); yet losing position and corresponding to night, thus bearing faults.\n**Guāng** (光) says: Lines five and above are *dissolving* (消), the sixth exceeds the center and corresponds to night, unable to preserve its purity and refinement.\nFor even white jade is prone to flaws, and clear water easily stained—thus, the great refinement is not what petty persons can fully preserve; they must inevitably bear faults and errors.\n\n**Seventh line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *at dawn* (辰) *bears faults* (愆), the virtuous person *mends faults* (补愆).\n**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) *at dawn* (辰) *bears faults* (愆), skilled at mending errors.\n**Wáng** (王) says: The seventh line dwells at the beginning of misfortune, the fault of the *睟* (Zhuàn) *time*. Yet with position attained and corresponding to day, they do not lose the virtue of the noble, thus able to mend faults without blame.\n**Guāng** (光) says: Faults in time, only the virtuous can mend them to complete their refinement.\nThe *Shī* (《诗》) says: *The grand robes have gaps, only Zhòngshānfǔ* (仲山甫) *mends them.*\n\n**Eighth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *in evil, without good.*\n**Zhè** (测) says: *睟* (Zhuàn) *in evil, without good*, ultimately unassailable.\n**Wáng** (王) says: Losing position and corresponding to night, pure in evil virtue, then good has no way to enter.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The eighth line is *rapidly stagnant* (疾瘀) and corresponds to night—those entirely pure in evil, how can they be aided?\n\n**Upper ninth line**, *睟* (Zhuàn) *at its end, ever as the beginning* (永初), upright.\n**Zhè** (测) says: The uprightness of *睟* (Zhuàn) *at its end*, truly praiseworthy.\n**Wáng** (王) says: The ninth line dwells at the extreme of the hexagram, yet attains position corresponding to day—this is the ability to preserve its purity and refinement, never losing the uprightness of the beginning.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The ninth line is the peak of refinement, able to be cautious at the end as at the beginning, fully preserving its purity and uprightness.\n\n**Two states, two districts, one department, two families flourish—**\n*The* **yīn** (阴) *family holds fire,*\n*Also measured by* **Dàyǒu** (大有).\n\n---\n\n**Entering the state of flourishing, second in sequence**—the thirty-third division, thirty seconds, corresponds to the day of *Chúnshǒu* (Blind Pheasant), aligning with the *qi* of *Mángzhǒng* (Grain in Beard).\n\nThe Dipper stands at the noon position, and the musical pitch is *Ruìbīn* (Reui-pin).\n**Yang-qi** (Yang *qi*) ascends in overwhelming abundance, filling all things with its fullness, as if they were entirely satisfied.\n\n**The original character *窴* (Yuàn) is pronounced *tián* (like \"field\").** The *Sòng* (Song) commentary states: *窴然* (Yuànrán), \"fullness.\" On the first line: *Flourishing yet not silent* (盛不墨), *loses the virtue of darkness* (失冥德).\n**Zhè** (测) says: *Flourishing yet not silent* means the center does not restrain itself.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* (Lu) texts originally read *终* (Zhōng, \"end\") instead of *中* (Zhōng, \"center\"), but now follow the *Fàn* (Fan) and *Wáng* (Wang) readings. *Lù* says: *克* (Kè), \"to overcome.\" Unable to overcome its own desires.\n**Wáng** says: The first line, dwelling at the onset of flourishing yet corresponding to night—*flourishing yet unable to silence itself*, a state that loses its virtue of darkness.\nThus, *it forfeits the virtue of its hidden and profound nature*.\n**Guāng** (光) says: *Mò* (墨), \"law/measure.\" In the *Way* of flourishing, the difficulty is not achieving it, but *how to dwell within it*. The first line is *contemplating the beginning* (思始), yet it corresponds to night. *Flourishing without law to restrain itself*, it thus *loses its virtue of concealment and subtlety*.\n\n**Second in sequence**—*not leaning on its own power* (作不恃), *overcoming Great Possession* (克大有).\n**Zhè** says: *Not leaning on its own power*, *it aligns with the virtue of the Mysterious* (称玄德).\n**Wáng** says: Dwelling in the time of flourishing, yet attaining the position of *drawing* (画)—*clear in the natural Way*, it has the *function of action* (作为之功), yet does not *rely on that function*.

The third line is *contemplating the upper* (思上), yet corresponding to night. The *gentleman* (君子) is guided by *righteousness* (义), while the *petty man* (小人) is guided by *profit* (利). The petty man, in seeking flourishing, only *pursues profit* (营利). Thus, it is said: *embracing profit, its chest full of satisfaction*. *Profit for the private* (利於私), *this is harm for the public* (斯害於公).\n\n**Fourth in sequence**—*small flourishing, subject to subjects* (小盛臣臣), *the gateway to great flourishing* (大人之门).\n**Zhè** says: *Small flourishing, subject to subjects*, *it serves the virtuous and wise* (事仁贤).\n(*The original text reads \"人\" (rén, \"person\"), but follows the Sòng, Lù readings.* The fourth line is the *beginning of prosperity* (福始), hence *small flourishing*. *臣臣* (Chénchén), *a state of self-humility and lowliness*.

The *overwhelming force of two fires* (二火之盛), *ascending fiercely* (炎炎上干), is *detested by the sixth line*, hence *cold springs are about to arrive*, with the *fear of being extinguished*.\n**Guāng** says: The seventh line is the *beginning of calamity* (祸始), yet corresponding to night. *Riding the fire* is the *peak of flourishing*. *Cold springs arriving* means *extinction is imminent*.\n\n**Eighth in sequence**—*drawing from the full brilliance* (挹于满荧), *nearing the danger of later collapse* (几后之倾).\n**Zhè** says: *Drawing from the full brilliance*, *it is nearly unavoidable*.\n(*The Sòng and Lù texts originally read *拘* (Jū, \"restrain\"), but now follow the Fàn and Wáng readings. The Wáng text originally lacked the *荧* (Yíng) character, now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings. The Fàn text originally read *几危也* (Jīwēi yě, \"nearing peril\"), now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.* *几* (Jī), pronounced *jī* (like \"machine\") or *qí* (like \"border\").\n**Wáng** says: *Attaining the position of day*, *skilled in dwelling within flourishing and fullness* (善於处盛满), yet able to *draw from the fullness*—*it nears the danger of later collapse, yet does not collapse*, *for it avoids ruin through humility and restraint*. Dwelling at the *peak of flourishing*, *without the Way of drawing from fullness*, *it is nearly unavoidable*.\n\n**Ninth line, uppermost**—*extreme flourishing cannot be saved* (极盛不救), *calamity descends from Heaven* (祸降自天).\n**Zhè** says: *Extreme flourishing cannot be saved*, *Heaven’s Way reverses*.\nThe ninth line dwells at *the extreme of flourishing* (盛极), *the day’s night*—*the end of calamity’s course* (逢祸之穷), *a state where extreme flourishing must decline*.\n\n---\n**Two states, two districts, one department, three families dwell**\n**The Yang family holds wood** (阳家木),\n**Measured by *Jiārén* (Family of Man)** (准家人).\n\n**The Yang state, vigorous and resplendent** (阳方躆肤赫赫),\n*is the fortress and ramparts of all things* (为物城郭),\n*all things thrive within it* (万物咸度).\n(*The Fàn text originally reads *万物咸得度* (wànwù xián dédù, \"all things attain thriving\"), now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.*)\n(*Lù* says: *Lù* (躆), \"the appearance of fullness and vigor.\" The Yang state *is the fortress and ramparts*, *all things dwell within it*, hence: *all things thrive*. **Wáng** says: *Fortress and ramparts* (城郭) are *external symbols*. **Guāng** says: *Fú* (肤) should also be read as *Lù* (躆).)\n(*Lù* (躆), *Lù* (躆), *a form of vigorous and forceful movement* (动作强梁貌).)\n\n**The Yang state, which shelters all things**, is said to nurture and defend them,\n*so that the Yin qi does not harm them*.\n**Thrive (度)**, should be read as **attain (得)**.\n**#38 (躆躆)**, an ancient form of *residence (宅)*.\n**Residence (宅)**, means *dwelling (居)*.\n\n**First (初一)**, neither praise nor blame,\n*successfully upholding one’s own family*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *Neither praise nor blame*—\n*this is the constant Dao*.\n**One (一)** is the lowest rank of dwelling in a family,\n*the symbol of descendants*,\n*and corresponds to the day’s brightness (昼)*.\n**To uphold the constant Dao**,\n*without blame or praise*,\n*is the master of preserving the family*.\n\n**Second (次二)**, the family lacks a *vessel (壶)*,\n*the wife serves her mother-in-law*,\n*or washes and anoints her*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *The family lacks a vessel*—\n*there is no means to pass it on*.\n*The vessel*—\n*that which receives from above to nourish below*.\n**If the family lacks a vessel**, then the lower does not provide sustenance.\n**Two (二)** is the middle rank of the lower body,\n*the symbol of the wife*.\n*The wife*—\n*that which receives from the mother-in-law*.\n**Now instead, the mother-in-law serves her**,\n*washing and anointing her*,\n*and bearing the laborious and humiliating tasks*,\n*thus disrupting order above and below*—\n*no greater inversion exists*.\n\n**Third (次三)**, the order of elders and juniors is established,\n*the son assists his father*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *The son assists his father*—\n*thus he can prosper*.\n*The Fàn text originally reads* **long and young sequence (长幼序序)**,\n*now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings*.\n**Wáng** states: *When one attains position, it is the day’s brightness*—\n*thus, the dwelling has proper ranks*,\n*elders and juniors each hold their place*,\n*and the son can undertake his father’s affairs*.\n**Guāng** states: *Three (三)* is the upper rank of the lower body,\n*and corresponds to the day’s brightness*.\n*The young can serve the old*,\n*and the son can fulfill his father’s duties*.\n\n**Fourth (次四)**, seeing a *wild boar (豕)* in the hall,\n*the dog bounds it repeatedly (击之迒)*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *Seeing a wild boar in the hall*—\n*its form is not auspicious*.\n**Derè (迒)**, pronounced *gāng*, also *hù-láng* (户郎).\n**System (系)**, is the same as *tie (系)*.\n**Derè (迒)**, *the tracks of a beast*.\n*The dog and the wild boar*—\n*both are unclean things*.\n*The hall*—\n*the place of the honored*.\n**Four (四)** is the middle rank of the lower body,\n*and yet it corresponds to the night*—\n*a small person’s Dao*.\n**The proper Dao for a family**,\n*is to rectify oneself*,\n*and then one can govern the family*.\n**Now, four (四)** is in the hall,\n*its own wild boar conduct present*,\n*then those below will also act like dogs*,\n*bounding forward in its tracks*—\n*it cannot be restrained*.\n**Auspicious (庆)**, means *good (善)*.\n\n**Fifth (次五)**, the *stern and prow of vessels (舳舻)* are harmonized and settled,\n*benefiting wealth and propriety*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *The stern and prow are harmonized*—\n*it follows its boundaries*.\n**Zhú (舳)**, *straight-six* (直六).\n**Lú (舻)**, *fall-Hu* (落胡).\n**Wáng** states: *It does not lose its dwelling*—\n*and yet nothing is too distant to reach*—\n*the meaning of being on a vessel*.\n**Five (五)**, having attained its proper position in the day’s brightness,\n*is the master of the dwelling*—\n*one who, when departing, will surely succeed*.\n**Thus, the stern and prow are harmonized and settled**,\n*and there is benefit in wealth and propriety*—\n*does it not uphold the Dao of the dwelling?*\n**Guāng** states: *Zhú (舳)*—\n*the rear of a boat where the steering oar is placed*;\n**Lú (舻)**—\n*the front of a boat where the paddle is fixed*.\n*Five (五)* is in the highest rank of dwelling,\n*and corresponds to the day’s brightness*—\n*a junzi who can govern his family*.\n**If the stern and prow are harmonized and settled**,\n*then the multitude relies on it for tranquility*;\n**If superiors and inferiors are in accord**,\n*then the family relies on it for governance*.\n*Wealth*—\n*the blessing of the family*.\n*Wealth that does not lose its rectitude*—\n*this is what makes it beautiful*.\n**Its (其)**, should be read as **none (无)**.\n\n**Sixth (次六)**, its *well and hearth (井灶)* are cast outside,\n*three years and it sees betrayal*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *Its well and hearth are cast outside*—\n*three years and it does not enjoy (sustenance)*.\n**Wáng** states: *Three years*—\n*the end of a numerical cycle*.\n**Guāng** states: *The well and hearth*—\n*the resources for drink and food*,\n*the essential duties of the family*.\n**If they are cast outside**, then how can the family sustain itself?\n**Six (六)** is beyond the middle and corresponds to the night—\n*a small person who cannot harmonize his clan*,\n*and instead drives them away*—\n*not exceeding three years before kin all rebel*.\n**Not enjoy (不享)**—\n*not obtaining drink and food*.\n\n**Seventh (次七)**, the *aged father harnesses the cart (老父擐车)*,\n*the young maiden lifts the vessel (少女提壶)*,\n*benefiting the father and the family*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *The aged father harnesses the cart*—\n*its form is now solemn*.\n*The Wáng text reads* **consider (考)** as *at (于)*,\n*now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings*.\n**Propose (拟)**, pronounced *huàn*.\n**Harness (擐)**, means *pierce (贯)*.\n*Piercing the cart’s pole with his hand to move it*—\n*this is how things are carried*.\n*Lifting the vessel*—\n*receiving from above to nourish below*.\n**Consider (考)**, means *complete (成)*.\n**Seven (七)** is the upper rank of the dwelling,\n*the symbol of the honored and lowly*.\n*The aged father*—\n*the most honored in the family*.\n*The young maiden*—\n*the most lowly in the family*.\n*The honored can bear the multitude*,\n*the lowly can receive from above*—\n**thus it benefits in completing the family**.\n*To govern the family*—\n*one cannot do so without solemnity*—\n**thus its form is solemn and majestic**,\n*and only then can it bear the multitude*.\n*The **Yì** states: *The Family of Man, resounding and bright*—\n*regret, peril, and auspice*.\n*The wife and children, laughing and cheerful*—\n*end in sorrow*.\n**Propose (拟)**—\n\n**Eighth (次八)**, its *table (几)* is overturned,\n*its legs doubled (朼)*,\n*and its family does not prosper*.\n**#39 (测)** states: *Its table overturned, its legs doubled*—\n*the family’s affairs are not flourishing*.\n*The Sòng and Lù readings* both have *female (牝)* for *leg (朼)*,\n*Wáng has male (牡)*,\n*now follows the Fàn reading*.\n*The family*—\n*Sòng and Lù read* **nine families (九家)**,\n*Fàn and Xiǎo Sòng read* **table family (几家)**.\n*According to the text*—\n*ancient* **its (其)** *was written as* **not (丌)**,\n*thus the error arose*.\n*Now follows the Wáng reading*.\n\n「**Legs (朼)** are the same as *bì* (匕).\nWhen the *table (几)* must bear above, *bì* must be single—this is the natural order.\nEight is the midpoint of calamity and belongs to night; to overturn its *table* means the young do not uphold the old, and the superior finds no rest.\n\nTo double its *bì* is for the family not to be governed by its elders, while those who wield authority multiply.\n**Edible (旨)** means *good*.\nWhen the young fail to uphold the old and the elders do not govern the lowly, the family’s Dao is in ruin—thus it is not good.\n\n**Upper Nine (上九)**, a stump sprouts suckers—its lineage does not perish.\n*The divination states*: A stump sprouts suckers—its kind thrives.\n*Sucker (蘖)*—read as *yúlìè* or *wǔgé*.\n*Lineage (种)*—read as *zhāngyǒng*.\nWáng says: Nine resides in excess, a symbol of withered decay, yet it holds its proper position by day—thus it is a stump that sprouts suckers.\nGuāng says: When wood is cut and regrows, it is called a sucker. #43\nNine marks the extreme of calamity—the family is already extinct.\nYet it falls upon the day’s night, meaning there remains a remnant lineage, capable of reviving the family.\n\n**Two Regions, Two Prefectures, Two Departments, One Family Law**\nThe Yin family’s metal aligns with *Jǐng* (井).\nTo change a city but not its well—no loss, no gain—symbolizing orderly movement between wells by law.\nIn Yáng Gāo County, its laws are upheld; all things emulate its standards, none failing to conform.\n*County (县)*—pronounced *xuán*.\nSòng says: *Mò (墨)* refers to the measuring lines of law.\nGuāng says: At this time, the Yang qi reaches its peak, and all things mirror it, none escaping its governance.\n\n**First (初一)**, establishing law without law.\n*The divination states*: Establishing law without law—it is insufficient.\nWáng says: At the outset of making law, yet it fails its proper position by night—unworthy of emulation.\nGuāng says: One signifies the beginning of thought, hence *establishing law*.\n*The Law of Speech (法言)* says: *Mó* not modeling, *fàn* not ranging—how much harm has been done!\n\n**Second (次二)**, modeling law with moderation—successful.\n*The divination states*: Modeling law with moderation—what all share.\n*Modeling (摹)* is the same as *mó*.\n*Modeling* is like *making*.\nTwo signifies central thought, yet it falls by day.\nTo make law with moderation is only then effective.\n*The Great Plan (洪范)*: The Royal Extremity—what all follow.\n\n**Third (次三)**, the plumb-line fails to be upright—losing its compass and square.\n*The divination states*: The plumb-line fails to be upright—its use is flawed.\n*Pǔ (甫)* means *good*.\n*Shuǎng (爽)* means *erroneous*.\nIf one cannot rectify oneself, how can one rectify others?\n\n**Fourth (次四)**, the plumb-line and square—none dare defy my implementation.\n*The divination states*: The plumb-line and square—this is personal conduct.\nThe gentleman first cultivates himself.\nWhen his conduct is upright, orders need not be given for them to follow.\n\n**Fifth (次五)**, deceptive and deceptive—jar with a hollow belly, well overflowing—yet none may drink.\n*The divination states*: Jar with a hollow belly—this is not the Way of learning.\nSòng and Lù originally read *bīn* as *míng*; now follows the Fàn and Wáng reading.\n*Plait (繘)*—pronounced *jú*.\n*Hollow (窴)*—pronounced *tián*.\n*Overflowing (潢)*—pronounced *huáng*.\nLù says: *Fāng (方)* means *Dao*.\nWáng says: A jar with a hollow belly cannot hold.\nA well overflowing—this is the appearance of excess water.\nYet none may drink—this is because the method of drawing is wrong.\nGuāng says: *Plait (繘)* is the rope for drawing.\n*Deceptive and deceptive (谲陆陆)*—the sound of the rope descending.\nIf the jar’s belly fills first, water cannot enter.\nThough the well overflows, none may drink.\nThe scholar who is empty receives others gladly.\nFifth resides at the well’s peak yet falls upon the night—petty men grow proud and full, unable to accept others.\n\n**Sixth (次六)**, at the threads and the cords—demonstrate the pure radiance.\n*The divination states*: At the threads and the cords—the great governance is clear.\nWáng says: To demonstrate the Dao of upright radiance, so that none are confused.\nGuāng says: Six resides in the upper blessing, applying its law—able to govern the threads and cords of the world, demonstrating the pure radiance to others.\n\n**Seventh (次七)**, a dense net cast into the abyss—unfavorable to scales.\n*The divination states*: A dense net cast into the abyss—tyrannical laws are spread.\nWáng says: Seven resides in excess, yet falls by night.\nTo make laws too dense, nets hanging in the depths—fish cannot rest, laws applied to the state—people find no ease.\nGuāng says: Seven is both *net* and *ruin*—falling upon the night’s day, laws are harsh and the people are terrified.\nThus it is said: A dense net cast into the abyss—unfavorable to scales.\n\n**Eighth (次八)**, rectify the guilty—drive them to righteousness.\n*The divination states*: Rectify the guilty—drive them onward.\n*Drive (驱)* is the same as *lí*.\nSòng says: Drive the people to righteousness.\nWáng says: Eight resides in the upper body’s center, yet falls by day.\nAble to apply its law, rectifying the guilty to bring none to wickedness.\nGuāng says: *Gé (格)* means *to reach*.\nTo rectify the guilty and reach the wicked—this is the excellence of punishment.\nShùn says: Punishment aims at no punishment.\n\n**Upper Nine (上九)**, the well lacks its rim—water flows straight—neither ravine nor valley—ending in transgression.\n*The divination states*: The well lacks its rim—law is wantonly indulged.\nWáng’s reading of *fěixī fěigǔ* as *lìxīn fěixī*—now follows the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn reading.\n*Rim (干)*—pronounced *hán*.\nFàn says: The rim checks and supports the well; drainage has its time.\nWáng says: At the extreme of law yet falling by night—this is lawlessness.\nA state without law—people easily transgress.\nA well without its rim—water overflows.\nGuāng says: Nine marks the extreme of calamity, yet falls by night.\nLaw is wantonly indulged without restraint—equivalent to lawlessness.\nThe people’s will is confused, knowing not what to follow, thus they transgress and end in chaos.\nLike a well without its rim, water flows straight—neither ravine nor valley—yet pours recklessly, ending in error.\n\n**Two Regions, Two Prefectures, Two Departments, Two Family Laws**\nThe Yang family’s earth aligns with *Xián* (咸).*\n\nThe **Sixth Entry** follows in sequence, marking **eighteen divisions and five seconds**, corresponding to the **Summer Solstice qi**. Hence, it aligns with *Lí* (離).\n\nWhen **Yang qi** reaches its peak above, **Yin’s omens** begin to stir below—**above and below resonate in harmony**.\n*\"Omens\"* (信) are akin to **auspicious signs**.\n\nOn the **first day**, the **Six Stems** align as *Luó* (羅), the **Five Branches** as *Lí* (離).\nThe **Divination** states: *\"Six Stems as Luó\"*—**clinging to the Lord of Lí**.\n\nOn the **second day**, above follows the **Lunar Stations** (歷), below harmonizes with the **Lü** (律).\nIf misaligned, it is **not so**.\nThe **Divination** states: *\"Above follows the Stations, below harmonizes with the Lü*—**this is not genuine**.\"\nFàn’s original text reads *\"kěn\"* (肯), now following the Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings.\n*\"Harmonize\"* (和) is pronounced *húwò* (胡卧).\n*\"Stations\"* (歷) refers to the **Twelve Celestial Stems** (十二辰).\n*\"Lü\"* (律) refers to the **Twelve Pitch Pipes** (十二管).\nThe **Celestial Stem** establishes the **Twelve Stems** above, while the **Lü** arranges the **Twelve Pipes** below—**above and below resonate in harmony**.\nIf they do not align, there is **no resonance**.\n\nOn the **third day**, **one vertical and one horizontal**—**the Celestial Net** (天網) is woven.\nThe **Divination** states: *\"One vertical and one horizontal\"*—**the warp and weft are arrayed**.\n*\"Vertical\"* (从) is pronounced *róng* (容切).\n*\"Arrayed\"* (，陈) is pronounced *lángwú* (郎吴) or *lángyán* (郎岩).\nFàn says: *\"Arrayed\"*—**a vast and expansive appearance**.\n\nThe King says: **\"The Celestial Net\"** (天網) embodies the meaning of **being sparse yet not leaking**.\n\n**Master Guang** states: The **third day** (三) corresponds to **Thought** (思) above, and **daytime** (昼) is when. The **virtuous person** (君子) can **weave the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth** (经纬天地).\n\n**Li** (离) signifies **cultural refinement** (文明), and also bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象).\n\nOn the **fourth day** (四), **\"I lift my nets and traps\"** (援我罘罟), **\"entangling snares spread across the fields\"** (絓罗于野至). The **Divination** states: **\"Lifting nets and traps\"** (援次罘罟) is **unable to act with benevolence** (不能以仁). **\"Lift\"** (援) is pronounced *yuán* (爰切). **\"Net\"** (罘) is pronounced *fú* (浮切). **\"Entangling\"** (絓) is pronounced *húguà* (胡卦切). The **fourth day** (四) marks when **yang-qi** (陽氣) is about to **extinguish** (熄), while **yin-qi** (陰氣) is about to **arise** (生); **virtue** (德) departs and **punishment** (刑) arrives. Again, **Li** (离) bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象), hence the saying **\"I lift my nets and traps\"** (援我罘罟), **\"entangling snares spread across the fields\"** (絓罗于野). **\"Arrive\"** (至) speaks of matters **drawing near**, as in the saying **\"treading frost\"** (履霜), **\"solid ice arrives\"** (坚冰至).\n\nOn the **fifth day** (五), **\"the dragon soars in Heaven\"** (龙翰于天), **\"its scales tremble with solemnity\"** (贞栗其鳞). The **Divination** states: **\"The dragon’s trembling\"** (龙翰之栗) signifies **uttermost fear of collapse** (极惧坠). **\"Soar\"** (翰) is pronounced *huán’ān* (胡安切). The King says: **Residing in the center** (居中) and **embodying rectitude** (体正), **obtaining its proper position** (得位) and **marking the time for response** (当画), it is the **master of correspondence** (应之主), hence the **symbol of the dragon flying in Heaven** (龙飞于天). **Master Guang** states: **The dragon** (龙) is used to **discuss yang** (论阳). **\"Soar\"** (翰) means **to fly** (飞). The **fifth day** (五) is **pure yang** (纯阳), the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), hence the saying **\"the dragon soars in Heaven\"** (龙翰于天). When the **virtuous person** (君子) stands at the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), he **must not fail to be upright** (不可不正) and **must not fail to be solemn** (不可不惧), hence the saying **\"its scales tremble with solemnity\"** (贞栗其鳞).\n\nOn the **sixth day** (六), **\"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven\"** (炽承于天), **\"the ice begins to sprout from Earth\"** (冰萌于地). The **Divination** states: **\"Ascending Heaven, sprouting from Earth\"** (承天萌地) signifies **the beginning of yang’s retreat** (阳始退). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **\"blazing yang\"** (炽承) as **\"ascending yang\"** (烝云), where **\"ascending\"** (烝) is the ancient form of **\"blazing\"** (炽), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **\"Blazing\"** (炽) is the **peak of yang** (陽之盛). **\"Ice\"** (冰) is the **ultimate of yin** (陰之极). The **sixth day** (六) falls at the **start of the Summer Solstice** (夏至之初), the **juncture of yang’s peak and yin’s rise** (陽极陰生之际); **the Way of the petty man grows long** (小人道长), while **the Way of the virtuous person diminishes** (君子道消), hence the saying: **\"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven\"** (炽承于天), **\"the ice begins to sprout from Earth\"** (冰萌于地). **The subtle warnings of reverence and caution** (敬戒之微) are fully contained here.\n\nOn the **seventh day** (七), **\"the sun strengthens its decline\"** (日强其衰), **\"response flourishes with solemnity\"** (应蕃贞). The **Divination** states: **\"Strengthening its decline\"** (自强其衰) is **to hate the proliferation of ruinous influences** (恶败类). **\"Hate\"** (恶) is pronounced *wùgù* (乌故切). The **seventh day** (七) marks the **beginning of calamity** (祸始) and **the time for response** (当画). The **virtuous person**, if he **can strengthen his declining Way** (能自强其衰), will **find many responding to him** (则应之者蕃多) and **will not lose his rectitude** (而不失其正).\n\nOn the **eighth day** (八), **\"at the peak of yang, summoning yin\"** (极阳征阴), **\"response follows without delay\"** (不移日而应). The **Divination** states: **\"At the peak of yang, summoning yin\"** (极阳征阴) is **the response to its manifestation** (应其发). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **\"summoning\"** (征) as **\"subtle\"** (微), and **\"response\"** (应) as **\"time\"** (时), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **When governance reaches its peak, disorder is summoned** (治极召乱), **when greatness reaches its peak, decline is summoned** (盛极召衰), **when fortune reaches its peak, calamity is summoned** (福极召祸), hence the response **without delay** (不移日而应).\n\nOn the **ninth day** (上九), **\"at the ultimate of Li\"** (元离之极), **the virtuous person responds with the Great Millet** (君子应以大稷). The **Divination** states: **\"At the ultimate of Li\"** (元离之极) is **unable to be restrained** (不可遏). **Fàn’s reading** (范本作) takes it as **\"unable to be restrained\"** (不可遏), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings** (今从宋、陆、王本). **Master Lù** (陆) says: **\"Restrained\"** (遏) means **to stop** (止). The **King** (王) says: **\"Great\"** (大) signifies **the sun approaching its setting** (日将暮). **Master Wú** (吴) says: **\"Millet\"** (稷) is pronounced and shares meaning with **\"Wu\"** (吴). **Master Guang** (光) states: **\"Li\"** (元离) is **Great Clarity** (大明). At the **ultimate of Great Clarity** (大明之极), **greatness at its peak must decline** (极盛必衰). The **virtuous person responds to the times** (君子应时), **aligning with their waxing and waning** (与之消息), hence the saying **\"the virtuous person responds with the Great Wu\"** (君子应以大吴).\n\n*(End of the third volume of the \"太玄经\" (Tàixuān Jīng) annotations.

States, Two Divisions, Three Families in Welcome**\n\n**Collected Commentary on the *Tàixuān Jīng* (太玄经) Scroll Four: Two Directions, Two States, Two Divisions, Three Families in Welcome**\n\n---\n\n**The Yin Family: Water, Aligned with *Xián* (咸)**\nWater of the Yin Family is also aligned with *Xián*.\nWhen welcoming in the second position, it is the day of *Shèyú Guǐ* (舍舆鬼).\nYin *qi* takes form below, and all things ascend to meet it.\n*Sù* (溯), pronounced *sù*, as in *sù* (素).\nSong [Commentary] says: *Sù* means \"to turn toward.\"\n\n**First Position:**\nWhen welcoming others without proper response—no proper omen, only evil.\nCè [Commentary] says: Welcoming others without proper response means it is not something to be joined with.\nWang [Commentary] says: At the beginning of welcoming, if one loses proper position at night, welcoming without the correct method.\nWhen things are not as they should be, and one responds by welcoming them, one loses the proper path and falls into evil.\nGuāng [Commentary] says: Welcoming aligns with *Xián*.\n*Xián* means \"to be moved by.\"\nThe first position is the beginning of thought, corresponding to night—being moved by external things that are not proper responses.\n\n**Second Position:**\nThe *jiāo* (蛟) hides in the depths, and the *líng* (陵) transforms its eggs.\nPeople may speak in secret, and the common folk agree with it.\nCè says: The transformation of the hidden *jiāo* is the manifestation of sincere intent.\nThe *Wángběn* sometimes reads *yǒu* (有), while the *Xiǎo Sòngběn* sometimes reads *rén yīnyán* (人言或阴) or *rényán yīn* (人言或阴); now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.\n*Hé* (和), pronounced *wò* (胡卧切).\nFàn [Commentary] says: The *jiāo* hides in the water, lays eggs on high banks, then returns to the depths—*qi* responds and interacts, and only then does it split and transform.\nGuāng says: The second position is the middle of thought, corresponding to day.\nWhen a sage’s sincerity reaches its peak, nothing remains impenetrable.\nThe *Yì* says: *\"The cuckoo cries in the Yin, and its young respond in harmony.\"*\n\n**Third Position:**\nThe subtle and refined *qi* moves back and forth; omens and spirits are aware first.\nCè says: The movement of subtle *qi* is an omen of misfortune.\nThe third position is the end of thought, corresponding to night.\nAt the juncture of heaven and humanity, when *qi* and omens interact, if humans stray from the Dao, omens and spirits become aware first.\n\n**Fourth Position:**\nThe lower garment has a child’s clothing, men’s eyes are like pearls, women sneeze with hooked breath—auspicious.\nCè says: The lower garment having a child’s clothing is the Yin responding to the Yang.\nThe *Wángběn* reads *shèng* (盛) for *gǎn* (感); now following the other editions.\n*Rú* (襦), pronounced *rú* (儒), meaning short clothing.\n*Hàn* (啑), pronounced *jiǎ* (色甲切). The *Wú* edition reads *tì* (嚏), pronounced *dì* (帝).\n**Fifth Position:**\nYellow rides on *Pǐ* (否)—auspicious.\nCè says: Yellow riding on *Pǐ* is not to be partnered with.\n*Pǐ* (乘), pronounced *shí* (时证切).\nWang says: Though the fifth position is central, it is in the Yin at night, improper and riding on the middle position—thus, \"Yellow rides on *Pǐ*, auspicious.\"\nGuāng says: Improper in position, insufficient for union.\n\n**Sixth Position:**\nThe Dark and Yellow meet in welcoming; their intentions are mutually responsive.\nCè says: The Dark and Yellow meeting in welcoming is responding by kind.\nFàn says: Heaven is Dark, Earth is Yellow.\nWhen Heaven and Earth meet in welcoming, winds and rains adjust in season;\nWhen ruler and minister meet in welcoming, governance and teaching follow measure.\nGuāng says: The sixth position is the utmost extent, the peak of responsiveness.\nFrom Heaven and Earth down to all things, from ruler to subject, from husband to wife, from friend to friend—none do not respond by kind.\n\n**Seventh Position:**\nFar [is] ——, near [is] *pǒu* (掊), welcoming *fù* (父) unexpectedly meets.\nCè says: Far ——, near *pǒu*—losing the kind of father.\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* reads ——; now following the other editions.\n——, pronounced *hòu* (许候切), meaning angry, glaring.\n*Pǒu* (掊), pronounced *hòu* (普后切), meaning to strike.\n*Jiā* (迦), same as *xiè* (邂), pronounced *xiè* (蟹).\n*Hòu* (逅), pronounced *hòu* (后), meaning to meet unexpectedly.\n\n**Eighth Position:**\nBlood is seen entering the gate; bowing to welcome in the central courtyard.\nCè says: Blood seen entering the gate is using virtue for self-defense.\nThe Sòng and Lù editions read *jiāo* (椒) for *jiān* (捬); now following the Fàn and Wáng editions.\n*Jiān* (捬), pronounced *fǔ* (府), meaning to defend.\nThe eighth position is the midpoint of misfortune, hence \"blood is seen entering the gate\"—those who cause harm have arrived.\nAt the day’s noon, one who can defend with virtue, welcoming and repelling in the central courtyard—things cannot harm, hence \"defending welcome in the central courtyard.\"\n\n**Ninth Position:**\nMoisture welcomes at the bed’s foot, accumulating at walls and houses.\nCè says: Moisture welcoming at the bed’s foot is ruin within.\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* and *Wángběn* read *zé* (泽) for *shī* (湿); now following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions.\nThe Fàn and Wáng editions read *fǎn* (罦) for *lěi* (累); now following the Sòng and Lù editions.\nFàn says: *Fǎn* means \"to cover.\"\nNow following the Sòng, Lù, and Fàn editions for *diān* (颠), though the *Wángběn* reads *yuàn* (愿).\n*Lěi* (累), pronounced *ruì* (良瑞切).\nThe ninth position is the extreme of misfortune, corresponding to night.\nIt is through which petty men and women can overturn states—not the work of a single day or night, but a gradual process.\nLike moisture welcoming at the bed’s foot, seeping upward to accumulate at walls and houses, beyond remedy.\nExamining the origins of ruin, it arises from within.\n\nTwo regions, two states, three departments, one household encountering\n**Yang Fire**—corresponds to *Guà* (姤).\nUpon entering, meeting the first day, the sun rests at *Liǔ* (柳).\nYin-qi begins to arrive, Yang-qi begins to depart, their comings and goings meeting.\n\n**First day:** *Yōu* (幽) meets *Shén* (神) and *Shī* (师), the omen is *zhēn* (贞).\n**Cè** says: *Yōu* meeting *Shén* is the thought of attaining principle.\n**Wáng** says: At the start of *Yōu*, the spirit meets but has not yet manifested—it is the symbol of a hidden communion with the divine.\n**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, and it corresponds to day.\nWith sincere devotion, one attains communion with *Shén* and *Shī*, even if it manifests in dreams, yet it does not lose its rectitude—just as when King Zhōu dreamed of Fù Yuè.\nDreams are matters difficult to verify.\nYet when sincerity reaches its peak, even dreams may be verified—how much more so when consulting with advisors and receiving blessings?\n\n**Second day:** *Chōngchōng* (冲冲) child meets, an ambiguous decree.\n**Cè** says: *Chōngchōng* child is the unworthy son.\nThe *Fàn* edition reads *bù shòu dìng* (不受定) for *bù dìng* (不定), now following the other editions.\n**Wáng** says: To meet without intention is *chōngchōng*.\nA child is a term for one in ignorance and confusion.\nThus, what certainty can there be in what it meets?\nThis is so because it is out of place, corresponding to night, and does not meet appropriately.\nThe unworthy son is clearly one without understanding.\n\n**Third day:** Neither going nor coming, attaining the virtue of *shì* (士) and *nǚ* (女).\n**Cè** says: Neither going nor coming is the proper conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.\nThe *Fàn* and *Wáng* editions read *bù wǎng bù lái bù qiú* (不往不来不求), but **Cè** says *bù wǎng bù qiú* (不往不求); now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.\n**Sòng** says: *Zé* (则) means law.\n**Guāng** says: Those who boast and self-promote are the shameful conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.\nThus, neither going nor coming yet meeting naturally is the proper conduct of *shì* and *nǚ*.\n\n**Fourth day:** [Blank], the *Duì* (兑) person meets rain—**calamity**.\n**Cè** says: The *Duì* person meeting rain is self-inflicted ruin.\n**Wáng** says: [Blank], the appearance of boldness without propriety.\n\n**Fifth day:** Hunting meets beasts, none forbid it.\n**Cè** says: Hunting meets beasts—this is truly worth emulation.\nFive is the peak of fortune, and it corresponds to day.\nAs when hunting meets beasts, if captured, who can resist taking them?\n\n**Sixth day:** *Bǐ* (俾) the spider weaves its snares, meeting a bee.\nThough the gain is great, one cannot follow.\n**Cè** says: The spider’s snares bring harm near at hand.\nThe bee is the same as *fēng* (蜂).\n**Fàn** says: To command the spider to weave snares and catch a bee.\nThe bee is a stinging insect, thus unable to be controlled.\nThough it may seem profitable, one cannot follow and take it.\n**Guāng** says: Six is the highest blessing, yet it corresponds to night.\nThe petty man, seeing gain, is eager to seize it, yet cannot attain his desire.\n\n**Seventh day:** Shaking its horns, the lord and father meet insult—this is not the proper command.\n**Cè** says: Shaking its horns is the straight path in action.\nSeven is the beginning of calamity, and it corresponds to day.\nIf the lord and father unfortunately meet insult, then the virtuous man shakes his horns, follows the straight path, and dies—it may not be the proper command, yet dying righteously leaves no choice.\n\n**Eighth day:** Two *sì* (兕) battle, one loses its horn—unable to prevail, suffering loss.\n**Cè** says: Two *sì* battling means losing a horn and suffering loss.\nVictory, *shì* (诗证切).\nLoss, *sàng* (息浪切).\nEight is the midpoint of calamity, and it corresponds to night.\nAs when two *sì* meet and battle, one loses its horn, it cannot prevail and suffers death.\nThe horn symbolizes the warrior who resists insult.\n**Ninth day:** Someone takes its horn, meeting below and damaging the foot.\n**Cè** says: Someone takes its horn—how can it be withstood?\nThe *Fàn* and *Wáng* editions read *dǐ qí jiǎo* (抵其角) for *huò shì qí jiǎo* (或氏其角); now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* editions.\n*Dǐ* (抵), *dū lǐ* (都礼切).\n\n---\nTwo regions, two states, three departments, two households at the stove:\n**Yin Wood**—corresponds to *Dǐng* (鼎).\nEntering the stove, the ninth position, twenty-eight degrees twenty-eight seconds, the sun’s course at *Jūn Huǒ* (鹑火), the *xiǎo shǔ* (小暑) *qì* responds.\nThe *Dòu* constellation aligns with *Wèi* (未), the *lǜ* (律) resonates with *Lín Zhōng* (林钟).\nThe *Dǐng* boils abundantly to nourish sages and worthies, thus the stove abounds with symbols of nurturing the virtuous.\nThough Yin may pour and scatter, Yang still holds and harmonizes it.\n*Hé* (龢), an ancient form of *hé* (和); same below.\n**Sòng** says: The stove harmonizes Yin and Yang, thus sometimes it pours, sometimes it harmonizes—thus it is so.\n**Guāng** says: Yin scatters, Yang harmonizes—this is the symbol of cooking.\n\n**First day:** The stove lacks substance, begging from neighbors.\n**Cè** says: The stove lacks substance—it has an empty name.\n**Wáng** says: At the start of the stove’s position, out of place and corresponding to night, it lacks substance.\nHaving lost the way of cooking, it cannot provide food, thus it begs from neighbors.\n**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, yet it corresponds to night—the petty man, inwardly lacking substance, steals others’ virtues to make a name for himself.\n\n**Second day:** The yellow *Dǐng* stands firm, its interior spacious—neither drinking nor eating, yet sincere and without harm.\n**Cè** says: The yellow *Dǐng* stands firm—its central integrity is virtuous.\n**Wáng** says: The *Dǐng* is the stove’s vessel.\n*Jiè* (介) means standing alone.\nIts spacious interior signifies broad tolerance and receptivity.\n**Guāng** says: Two is in the lower body’s center and corresponds to day, a position of *fāng jǔ* (方沮), yet not yet attaining lower blessing.\nThe virtuous man guards the middle path, retreats to cultivate himself, and does not take food lightly.\nNourishing his resolve inwardly, he does not covet externals, thus though he neither drinks nor eats, his sincerity truly harms nothing.\n\n**Third day:** The stove lacks firewood, yet gold flows nearby.\n**Cè** says: The stove lacks firewood—it is unused.\n*Pín* (濒), pronounced *pín* (频).\n\n**Fourth day:** The *Gē* (鬲) is filled with food, attaining its labor and effort.\n**Cè** says: The *Gē* filled with food is timely nourishment for me.\n*Gē* (鬲), pronounced *lì* (历).\n**Wáng** says: *Gē* is the smaller cooking vessel.\n**Guāng** says: A *Dǐng* with a broad base is called *Gē*.\nFour is the lower blessing, and it corresponds to day.\nThe virtuous man uses blessings to nourish the worthy, even if little, yet attains their labor and effort.\n\n**Fifth day:** The *Dǐng* is large enough for libation—yet neither solemn nor orderly.\n**Cè** says: The *Dǐng* large enough for libation—feasting without sincerity.\n*Qí* (齐), pronounced *cè* (侧) and *qiè* (皆).\n**Wáng** says: There is no intent of grand feasting with solemnity.\n**Guāng** says: *Shāng* (觞), should be read *shāng* (商), meaning \"to cook.\"\nFive occupies the position of abundance, and thus can nourish the worthy, hence it is said: The *Dǐng* is large enough for libation.\nYet if, though it corresponds to the day’s night, one cannot treat the scholars of the world with propriety, then all scholars will refuse to return.\n\nThe *Hong Fan* says: \"All those who are upright, when they have grown rich, will then govern the people.\"\n\n**Sixth day:** The five flavors are blended, harmonized like fine soup—this is the feast of the great sage.\n**Cè** says: The feast of blended flavors—this is the duty of the prime minister.\n**Wáng** originally wrote *měi* (美) as *gēng* (羹), but the *Xiǎo Sòng* version reads: \"Five flavors harmonized, rich as fine soup,\" now following the *Sòng, Lù, and Fàn* editions.\n**Wáng** says: The duty of the prime minister is to blend the five flavors; when the great sage finds the right person, he feasts them accordingly.\n**Guāng** says: Six is the highest blessing, corresponding to day.\nThe virtuous man assists the state, offering what is right and rejecting what is wrong, advancing the worthy and removing the unworthy, harmonizing governance like blending flavors into fine soup, and presenting it to the ruler.\nIf the ruler then feasts them, the world will be in great order.\n\nHigh King Zǒng’s command says: If you make the blended soup, you must use salt and plum sauce.\nThe Three Dukes serve the ruler, bearing the symbol of the *Dǐng*.\n\n**Seventh day:** The cow’s fat is properly rendered, yet without washing the axe before boiling, the sickness of *Ōu* and *Yù* will come.\n**Cè** says: The cow’s fat and *Ōu-Yù*—this is an unclean resolve.\n*Fāng* (肪), pronounced *fāng* (方).\n*Ōu* (欧), pronounced *wū-hòu* (乌后).\n*Yù* (鴂), pronounced *cuī-dōu* (衰都).\n**Fàn** says: *Ōu-Yù* is the sound of vomiting.\n**Wáng** says: *Pí-niú* (脂牛) is a fat cow.\n**Guāng** says: *Fāng* (肪) is fat. *Ōu* (欧) is to vomit. *Yù* (鴂) is when the heart dislikes something and one vomits.\nThe fat of a fat cow is used to illustrate fine blessings.\nThough the ruler may nourish scholars with fine blessings, if he does not approach them with sincere and pure resolve, the scholars will surely despise him.\nSeven marks the beginning of calamity, the omen of losing the hearts of the worthy.\n\n**Eighth day:** Eating its leftovers, though one calls out, it is not ruined.\n**Cè** says: Eating its leftovers—this is to cover one’s virtue.\n*Wěi* (委), pronounced *yú-wěi* (於伪).\n*Jiào* (噭), same as *jiào* (叫).\n\n**Ninth day (uppermost):** The stove’s fire is extinguished—this is the family’s calamity.\n**Cè** says: The stove’s fire extinguished—this is the state’s traitor.\nThe stove’s fire extinguished illustrates not nourishing the worthy.\nThose who do not nourish the worthy are self-made traitors to their state.\nExamples include: Jiè killing Guān Lóngróng, Zhòu killing Bǐ Gān, Fú Chā killing Wú Yuán, and Xiàng Yǔ driving Fàn Zēng—they are all of this kind.\n\n*(Note: The final line appears fragmented;

If no one sees its tracks, how could misfortune ever reach them?\nIt is like fleeing into water—water follows and smooths out, sealing its marks, so no one can perceive its traces.\n\n**Second, The Heart Trembles, Feet in Gold Sandals, No Will to Enter the Ravine.**\nThe **Zè** says: The trembling heart—its resolve is not firm.\nThe **Fàn** text reads *惕*, the **King’s** text reads *惕*, noting that *惕* is the ancient character; here, we follow the **Song** and **Lù** texts.\nThe **Song** and **Lù** texts read *含* for *金*, while the **King’s** text reads *望*; here, we follow the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo-Sòng** texts.\nThe **Song** says: *Jiāng* means \"to proceed,\" unable to resolve the heart with principle before acting.\nThe **Guāng** says: *Jīn* symbolizes firmness and endurance.\nThe second is the midpoint of contemplation, occurring at night.\nThough the petty person sees disaster approaching, trembling in fear, they cannot resolve themselves with principle. Clinging to their honors and emoluments, they linger and do not depart, unaware that the ravine lies beneath their feet—soon they will stumble and fall.\nConfucius said: *\"To see what is right and not do it is cowardice.\"*\n\n**Third, Trembling at the Thighs, Whipping the Horse, Bandits Glance at the Door, Fleeing for Gain.**\nThe **Zè** says: Trembling at the thighs and whipping the horse—disaster is near at hand.\nThe **Fàn** text reads *望* as *望*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **King’s** texts.\nThe **Chén** says: *望* is the ancient character for *望*.\nThe **Song** says: *Near at hand* means the bandits are already close.\nThe **Guāng** says: The third is the end of contemplation, occurring in daylight.\n*To flee* is what is fitting.\nTrembling at the thighs—fear.\nWhipping the horse—desire for swift departure.\nBandits glance at the door—disaster is imminent.\nAt this moment, it is advantageous to flee.\n\n**Fourth, The Towering Tree is Shaken, Flying Birds Pass Over, Some Alight and Descend.**\nThe **Zè** says: Birds of the towering tree—if they wish to stop, they descend.\nThe **Song**, **Lù**, and **King’s** texts read *枞* for *摐*; here, we follow the **Fàn** text.\n*Or alight and descend*—the **Song** and **Lù** texts read *止之*, while the **Fàn** text reads *或降*; here, we follow the **King’s** text.\nThe **Fàn** says: *Shaking upward* is called *摐*.\nA tree shaken upward is where birds do not gather, so they pass and depart.\nThe **Guāng** says: *摐* depicts tall and dense growth.\nThe fourth is the lower emolument, occurring at night.\nThe petty person’s resolve to retreat is not steadfast; encountering fine emoluments, they halt and do not depart, thus not escaping calamity.\n\n**Fifth, Seeing the *Zhuàn* in the Forest, the Otter Enters the Abyss—an Auspicious Omen.**\nThe **Zè** says: Seeing the *Zhuàn* and the otter—deep retreat from disaster.\nThe **Fàn** text reads *鹭* as *鹭*, while the **King’s** text reads *鹭*; here, we follow the **Song** and **Lù** texts.\nThe **King’s** text reads *利征* for *征*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** texts.\n*Zhuàn* is the ancient character for *年*; another reading is *鹰*.\n*Zhuàn* is pronounced *cí-xù* (慈恤).\nThe **Song** says: *Zhuàn* harms birds; the otter harms fish.\nThe **Wú** says: *Zhuàn*—to tread.\nThe **Guāng** says: The fifth is the middle emolument, occurring in daylight.\nThough the **Junzi** holds a high position and enjoys rich emoluments, seeing petty men wielding power in court and knowing they will bring chaos, they depart.\n\n**Sixth, Many Fields but No Harvest, Exhausting My Labor.**\nThe **Zè** says: Many fields but no harvest—labor is spent in vain.\nThe **Song** and **Lù** texts read *会* for *费*; here, we follow the **Fàn** and **King’s** texts.\n*功* is pronounced *hù-jiā* (户佳).\nThe **Fàn** says: *Who will eat?* is *功*.\n\nThe **King** says: The sixth hexagram, when overfull, loses its position at night, and does not know how to escape appropriately.\n\nIf one cultivates fields in the hexagram of Many Fields, yet does not manage them properly, only consuming food and labor without benefit.\n\nThe **Guāng** says: The sixth hexagram is the highest emolument, representing abundance and extremity, yet it occurs at night.\n\nThe petty man’s virtue is thin though his position is high, his strength is little though his responsibilities are heavy. Though he may possess abundant resources, he cannot govern them well—accomplished men all abandon him and flee, consuming food and labor in vain. How could he achieve success?\n\n**Seventh, Seen in Bonds, Only Then Able to Fly.**\nThe **Zè** says: Seen in bonds—almost not enough to rise high.\n\n*Jǐ*, pronounced *jī* (as in *jì*).\nThe **Song** says: *Jǐ* means \"near.\"\n\nAlready seen in bonds, barely escaping, this is why it is said to be near. The **King** says: In times of fleeing danger, the seventh hexagram marks the beginning of calamity—one who flees only after the time has passed, hence \"seen in bonds.\"\n\nYet when in position during the day, one can preserve ultimate well-being, hence \"only then able to fly,\" escaping his misfortune.\n\nThe **Junzi**, though entangled in constraints, does not dwell in a chaotic realm. Ultimately, he must withdraw and distance himself, hence \"only then able to fly.\"\n\n**Eighth, The Neck Added to the Snare, Bound by Its Cord.**\nThe **Zè** says: The neck added to the snare—no self-effort remains.\n\nThe **King** says: *Měng*, the same as *yì* (wing).\nThe eighth hexagram loses its position at night, unable to avoid misfortune, hence the head is caught in the snare.\n\nThough it flaps its wings within the net, there is no possibility of flight. The **Guāng** says: *Měng* is the arrow used in hunting.\n\nThe eighth hexagram is the midpoint of calamity, occurring at night, unable to flee far from disaster. The snare is already on the neck—though it struggles and tugs at the cord, how could it escape? Only self-exhaustion remains.\n\n**Ninth, It is advantageous to flee, limping and halting; the thief’s virtue clings to the city.**\nThe **Zè** says: The thief’s virtue clings to the city—why flee at all?\nThe **King**’s text reads *virtue-thief*, the small **Song** text reads *thief-obtains*; here, we follow the **Song**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** texts.\n\nThe **Chén** says: *Pǐ*, pronounced *píng* (as in *bīng*), also *pú-xián* (蒲贤).\nThe **Zìshū** says: *Pǐ* means hardened calloused skin.\n\nTwo regions, three states, two departments, two families of the Tang dynasty—**Yīn** family earth—also corresponds to *dùn* (遁).\n\n**Lù says:** The *Táng* is a great dispersion—all under Heaven flee.\nFlee is also dispersion.\n**Guāng says:** *Táng* is like *dàngdàng*—unrestrained, with the sense of loss.\nYin-qi comes here, Yang-qi departs—things sway *dàngdàng*.\n**Sòng says:** *Zī* means \"to augment.\"\n**Lù says:** *Dàngdàng* is the appearance of emptiness exhausted.\n\n**First (crawl):** *Táng* within—do not act; perilous.\n**Cè says:** *Táng* within—no steadfastness.\nOne is the beginning of thought, yet it falls to night.\nWithin, there is nothing to hold—movement brings danger.\n\n**Second (treading):** *Táng* in darkness—advantageous to use eastward campaigning.\n**Cè says:** The advantage of *Táng* in darkness is to seek the Bright Way.\nDarkness is obscurity.\nEast is where the sun rises.\nTwo is the middle of thought, dwelling in the lower body’s depths—thus *Táng* in darkness.\nIts heart is swaying, lost in where to go.\nYet in the sun’s day, the superior person seeks the Bright Way to advance himself.\n\n**Third (abrupt):** *Táng* in whiteness—untrue, losing *lónglíng*.\n**Cè says:** Losing *lónglíng*—not yours to lose.\n**Wáng says:** *Lónglíng*—the sound of jade.\n\n**Fourth (youthful):** *Táng* without destination—Dao and virtue as refuge.\n**Cè says:** *Táng* without destination—only virtue grants.\nDestination—*dīnglì* (丁历) cut, same below.\nRefuge—*bìyì* (必益) cut.\nGrant—*yúlǚ* (余吕) cut.\n**Wáng says:** Four obtains position in daylight, fitting *Táng*’s nature—swaying, without destination or refusal, taking Dao and virtue as refuge.\nKnowing where to go—*Táng*’s excellence.\nRefuge—lord.\n**Guāng says:** Destination—inevitability.\nFour is smooth and flourishing, yet in daylight.\nConfucius said: The superior person in the world has no fixed destination, no refusal—only virtue aligns with him.\nThus it says *Dao and virtue as refuge*—speaking of its highest eminence.\n\n**Fifth (dashing):** Fleeing deer, cradling the shrew—gain not even *zī*.\n**Cè says:** Fleeing deer, cradling the shrew—insufficient achievement.\n**Fàn, Wáng** texts read *xīzúgōng* (奚足功), now following **Sòng, Lù** texts.\n**Wú says:** *Qú* (鼷)—*hùjī* (户鸡) cut, a small mouse.\n**Wáng says:** Five occupies the peak position, should be the leader, yet loses position at night.\nWithout the virtue of lordship, swaying and unguarded, confused between profit and harm.\nChasing deer in flight, yet turning to the shrew-mouse—what is gained is insufficient as provision.\n*Zī*—same as *zī* (资).\n\n**Sixth (gentle):** *Táng* not self-sufficient—substituting Heaven’s rank and rewards.\n**Cè says:** *Táng* not self-sufficient—no private capacity.\n**Wáng says:** Obtains position in daylight, as *Táng*’s lord—swaying, without private gain, not seeking self-sufficiency, sharing Heaven’s blessings with all—thus able to substitute Heaven in bestowing rank and rewards.\nA sage ruler in his time, dwelling in *Táng*’s excellence—none surpasses this.\n**Guāng says:** Six is upper reward, abundant and flourishing, yet in daylight.\nThe superior person does not monopolize Heaven’s blessings but shares them with all worthy.\n\n**Seventh (oppressing):** Hunt the three flights—brightly manifest in campaigning, yet all day not returning—lost.\n**Cè says:** Hunt the three flights—destination without guidance.\n**Wáng says:** Dwelling in excess, yet losing position at night.\nUnclear in the Way, self-inflicting peril and ruin.\nLike hunting one flight yet seeking three—nowhere to turn.\nSelf-illuminated yet wandering until evening, swaying and confused—what good remains?\n**Guāng says:** Seven is lost aspiration, yet at night.\nThe petty man wavers in virtue, losing this for that, swaying without steadfastness, laboring in vain.\nFrom youth to old age, ultimately gaining nothing.\n\n**Eighth (binding):** *Táng* collects rewards—spirit of the community halts its weeping, some receive their *mù*.\n**Cè says:** *Táng* collects rewards—yet again lost.\n*Fù*—*fúmù* (符目) cut, same below.\n**Wáng says:** Obtains position in daylight, skilled in *Táng*’s Way—thus able to reclaim its rewards.\n**Guāng says:** Eight is calamity’s midpoint, yet fortune and rewards have scattered.\nYet in the sun’s day, able to revive decline and restore ruin—thus *Táng* collects rewards.\nThe spirits of land and grain, once more receiving blood-sacrifice, thus halt their weeping.\nThe people, already withered, yet again receive nourishment—thus some receive their *mù*.\n\n**Ninth (shedding):** Bright pearl shot at flying flesh—what is gained does not compensate.\n**Cè says:** Bright pearl shot at flesh—expenditure unmatched.\n*Dàng*—*dīnglàng* (丁浪) cut.\n**Fàn says:** Flying flesh—birds and owls.\nThe pearl is heavy, the owl light—seeking the light with the heavy, thus no compensation.\n**Wáng says:** Nine occupies the extreme peak, yet loses position at night—swaying, heard in the great reckoning.\nLike shooting a pearl at a sparrow—what is gained does not replace what is lost.\n**Guāng says:** Nine is calamity’s extremity, yet at night.\nThe petty man indulges desires to excess, swaying and forgetful.\n\nTwo regions, three states, two departments, three families—constant.\n**Yáng** family water—corresponds to *héng* (恒).\n\n「Entering the *Cháng* (常) phase, the twenty-third day of the twenty-sixth degree—*Lìqiū* (立秋) aligns with the *qi* (气). The day corresponds to **Qúntǎo** (鹑尾), the **Fùxiàng** (斗) constellation marks the **Shēn** (申) position, and the **Yízhé** (夷则) musical pitch resonates.\n\n**Ninth (shedding):** The day relinquishes its **Yì** (翼).\nBy **Yīn** (阴) one discerns the **Bì** (辟) [as **Bì**, pronounced *bì*, or \"wall\"#17], by **Yáng** (阳) one discerns the **Jūn** (君) [as \"sovereign\"].\nThe **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) [as \"minister\"] **Dao** (道) is immutable across the ten thousand ages.\n**Bì** (辟), when read as **Jūn** (君), is \"sovereign.\"\n\n**Song** (宋) says: **Bì** (辟) is the **Jūn** (君).\nThis is the beginning of **Lìqiū** (立秋).\nAs autumn succeeds summer, it is the **Dao** (道) of Heaven.\nThus at this time, **Yīn** (阴) knows to serve as **Chén** (臣), **Yáng** (阳) knows to act as **Jūn** (君).\n**Guāng** (光) says: As autumn succeeds summer, as **Yīn** (阴) succeeds **Yáng** (阳), as **Chén** (臣) succeeds **Jūn** (君)—this is the symbol.\n\n**First (day):** Wearing the **Dàishén** (戴神) [as \"donning the divine\"] **Mò** (墨) [as \"black ink\"], stepping on the **Lǚlíng** (履灵) [as \"treading the sacred\"] **Shì** (式) [as \"pattern\"], with one to govern ten thousand, yet never failing in **Wú** (吴) [as \"harmony\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: Wearing **Dàishén** (戴神) **Mò** (墨) is to embody one form.\n**Wáng** (王) and **Wú** (吴) both say: **Jì** (稷) is the same as **Wú** (吴).\n**Mò** (墨) and **Shì** (式) are both **Fǎ** (法) [as \"principles\"]—the **Shén** (神) and **Líng** (灵) [as \"divine and numinous\"] are revered.\nOne is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as \"noble one\"]’s heart clings to one principle as the constant **Fǎ** (法), responding to all transformations of the ten thousand things, yet never lacking in **Wú** (吴) [as \"harmony\"].\nThe *Yì* (易) [as *Book of Changes*] says: \"All movement under Heaven is governed by steadfast adherence to the One.\"\n**Second (day):** The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微) [as \"subtle\"], **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) [as \"female steadfastness\"] **Lì** (厉) [as \"perilous\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微), the **Nǚ** (女) [as \"female\"] is not steadfast.\n**Wáng** (王) originally wrote **Chángnèi** (常内) **Wēi** (微), but now follows the other schools.\n**Wáng** (王) says: During the **Cháng** (常) phase, one should uphold the proper **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣), **Fùfù** (夫妇) [as \"husband and wife\"].\nThe second day loses its position at night#18—this is the **Cháng** (常) phase subtly yielding to a lowly **Nǚ** (女) [as \"female\"] within.\nThe symbol of unsteadfastness is near danger, hence **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) **Lì** (厉) [as \"perilous\"].\n\n**Third (day):** The day upholds its **Dé** (德) [as \"virtue/power\"], three years without eating.\n**Cè** (测) says: The day upholds its **Dé** (德), the **Jūn** (君)’s **Dao** (道) is clear.\nThree is self-so, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe day upholds its **Dé** (德), thus escaping the calamity of meager nourishment.\nThe **Jūn** (君) upholds his **Dé** (德), thus avoiding the guilt of reckless usurpation.\n**Yīyǐn** (伊尹) admonished **Tàijiǎ** (太甲), composing the *Xián yǒu yī Dé* (咸有一德).\n\n**Fourth (day):** The month does not uphold, sometimes losing it in **Xíng** (行) [as \"conduct\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The month does not uphold, the **Chén** (臣) loses his **Xíng** (行).\n**Xíng** (行) is read as it is written.\nThe month has waxing and waning, hence it does not uphold.\n**Xíng** (行) is the **Dao** (道).\nFour is **Wàitā** (外佗) [as \"external excess\"], yet it occurs at night.\nIf the **Chén** (臣)’s **Dé** (德) is not constant, he loses the **Dao** (道).\n\n**Fifth (day):** Its **Cóng** (从) [as \"following\"] and its **Héng** (横) [as \"crossing\"], the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth.\n**Cè** (测) says: Its **Cóng** (从) and its **Héng** (横) are the constants of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣).\n**Cóng** (从), pronounced *róng* (容).\n**Fàn** (范) says: Heaven follows Earth’s crossing—this is their constant **Dao** (道).\n**Wáng** (王) says: The fifth day occupies the middle position, as the master of **Cháng** (常).\nObtaining its position during the day, it follows and crosses the **Jīngwéi** (经纬) [as \"vertical and horizontal principles\"], all in accord with the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth, attaining the immutable **Dao** (道) across the ten thousand ages.\n**Guāng** (光) says: Five is the **Zhōnghé** (中和) [as \"central harmony\"], the peak of **Cháng** (常).\nThe **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) is their **Jīngwéi** (经纬).\n\n**Sixth (day):** Obtaining seven and nine, the **nuò** (懦) [as \"weak\"] and **náo** (挠) [as \"flexible\"] overcome the **gāng** (刚) [as \"rigid\"], unable to uphold the **Cháng** (常).\n**Cè** (测) says: Obtaining seven and nine is to abandon **Shèng** (盛) [as \"peak\"] and ride upon **Cuī** (衰) [as \"decline\"].\nSeven is the peak of **Yáng** (阳).\nNine is the decline of **Yáng** (阳).\nThe sixth day passes the middle and occurs at night—abandoning peak and riding decline.\nThe petty man is weak, bending and corrupting his rigidity, unable to guard his constant **Dao** (道).\n\n**Seventh (day):** **Tāotāo** (滔滔) [as \"flowing\"] **wǎnglái** (往来) [as \"movement\"], with **Cháng** (常) decline as **Rú** (如) [as \"pattern\"], able to uphold the **Zhēn** (贞) [as \"steadfast\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: **Tāotāo** (滔滔) **wǎnglái** (往来) is to uphold the proper **Dao** (道) in response to the improper.\n\n**Eighth (day):** The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) [as \"illness\"] yet not **Jí** (疾), the **jiù** (咎) [as \"fault\"] is formed yet not **Jí** (诘) [as \"rectified\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) yet not **Jí** (疾)—it cannot self-govern.\nEight is the midpoint of calamity, yet it occurs at night.\nThe **Cháng** (常) **Dao** (道), long practiced, now has weariness—hence **Chángjí** (常疾).\nIf one who is ill knows his illness, it may still be treated.\nIf one does not know his illness yet abhors hearing of it#20, then it is certainly incurable#21.\nThe petty man does not know his calamity yet abhors hearing of it, until the **xiōngjiù** (凶咎) [as \"grievous fault\"] is formed#22—it cannot be rectified again.\n\n**Upper Ninth (day):** **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾), **Wūyī** (巫医) [as \"diviners and healers\"] do not fail.\n**Cè** (测) says: **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾)—able to self-heal.\n**Wáng** (王) says: The ninth day occupies the extreme peak, yet obtains its position during the day—one who can **Jí** (疾) his **Jí** (疾).\nGood at self-admonition, thus the **Wūyī** (巫医) [as \"diviners and healers\"] do not fail in treating him.\n**Wūyī** (巫医) refers to wise counselors.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The ninth is the end of calamity, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as \"noble one\"] can reflect on misfortune and preemptively guard against it, receiving loyal advice and seeking wise counsel to aid himself—thus calamity may be resolved.\n\nTwo regions, three states, three departments, one family—**Dù** (度) [as \"measure\"].\n**Yīn** (阴) family **Huǒ** (火) [as \"fire\"], corresponds to **Jié** (节) [as \"regulation\"].\n**Fǎ** (法) [as \"principles\"] serve as models, **Dù** (度) [as \"measure\"] serves as the standard.\n**Yīn** (阴) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Zào** (躁) [as \"agitated\"], **Yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Shě** (舍) [as \"retreating\"].\n**Zào** (躁) and **Zào** (躁) **Shě** (舍) and **Shě** (舍), each attains its **Dù** (度).\n**Shě** (舍), pronounced *shě*, or read as it is written.\n**Sòng** (宋) says: **Zào** (躁), movement.\n**Shě** (舍), concealment.\n**Wáng** (王) says: **Shě** (舍), cessation.\n**Guāng** (光) says: **Zào** (躁) refers to **Yīn** (阴) advancing in vigor.\n**Shě** (舍) refers to **Yáng** (阳) withdrawing.\nThe **Zào** (躁) grows more **Zào** (躁), the **Shě** (舍) grows more **Shě** (舍)—each guards its constant **Dù** (度).\n\n**First (day):** The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost.\n**Cè** (测) says: The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost—it cannot achieve success.\nOne is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs at night.\nThe petty man’s measure in the heart has already strayed and been lost—how could he achieve success?\nThe *Shāngshū* (商书) [as *Book of Documents*] says: \"If one anticipates danger and sets traps, then going to inspect and rectify according to **Dù** (度) will release [the situation].\"\n\n**Second (day):** The **Zé** (泽) [as \"benefits\"] does not **Shě** (舍) [as \"retreat\"], **Míng** (冥) [as \"obscure\"] within the **Dù** (度).\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Zé** (泽) does not **Shě** (舍)—only then can it be proper.\n\n**Third (day):** The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差) [as \"erratic\"], the **Dà** (大) **Lǎi** (攋) [as \"collapse\"] is the stage.\n**Cè** (测) says: The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差), the great **Dù** (度) is **Qīng** (倾) [as \"tilting\"].\nSmall **Sòng** (宋), **Chén** (陈), and **Wú** (吴) manuscripts originally read **Tā** (獭) [as \"otter\"], but **Wáng** (王) read **Qīng** (倾), and now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts.\n**Fàn** (范) manuscripts read **Chāchā** (差差) as **Zhīchā** (之差), but now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts.\n**Lǎi** (攋), pronounced *lài* (赖).\n**Guāng** (光) says: **Lǎi** (攋) is \"ruin and fracture\"#28.\n\nThe **Third (day)** is the completion of thought, and the time is night.\nThought not in accord with **Dù** (度) will lead to erratic and failed matters.\nHence it is said: Small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差), the great **Lǎi** (攋) is the stage of ruin—\nfor though what is lost may be small, what is destroyed will be great.\n\n**Fourth (day):** **Gànzhēng** (干桢), advantageous for city construction.\n**Cè** (测) says: The advantage of **Gànzhēng** (干桢) lies in its **jīngyíng** (经营).\nThe **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts read *gān* (干) as *gàn* (干#29); now follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lǚ** (陆) manuscripts.\nThe **Fourth (day)** is the bestowal of blessings below, and the time is day.\nWhen the **junzi** (君子) has attained his station,\nhe must always use **fǎdù** (法度) as his **Gànzhēng** (干桢),\nthus he can safeguard his people and undertake great **jīngyíng** (经营).\n\n**Fifth (day):** **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干), ruin to his undertakings.\n**Cè** (测) says: **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干) means he cannot have peace.\n**Wáng** (王) says: One who has lost his station at night cannot be the leader of the people.\nA **cái** (才) that is **Gàn** (干) yet not truly **Gàn** (干) will inevitably topple all he has undertaken.\n**Guāng** (光) says: A man who lacks **Dù** (度) leaves the people without order—\njust as **Gàn** (干) not **Gàn** (干) will destroy what he has undertaken, bringing no stability.\n\n**Sixth (day):** Great **Dù** (度) **jiǎnjiǎn** (检检), manifesting **xiàng** (象) to Heaven, and setting its standard.\n**Cè** (测) says: Great **Dù** (度) **jiǎnjiǎn** (检检) is the **chéngxiàng** (垂象) of rectitude.\n**Fàn** (范), same as **Fàn** (范).\n**Wáng** (王) says: The **Sixth (day)**, occupying the most exalted position,\nis the greatest **Dù** (度)—one who attains his station at day.\nHe who is clear in **fǎzhì** (法制) and uses **Dù** (度) to examine things\nwill take Heaven’s **xiàng** (象) and set its **fǎ** (法) for the world.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The **junzi**’s establishment of **fǎdù** (法度)\nis not drawn from his own heart.\nInstead, he observes **xiàng** (象) in Heaven\nto set a standard for the world,\nhence it is said: Heaven demonstrates **xiàng** (象), and it sets its standard.\nThe *Yì* (易) says: Heaven demonstrates **xiàng** (象), the sage follows it.\n\n**Seventh (day):** Without **Dù** (度), **guī** (规) is not applied—ghosts will mock it.\n**Cè** (测) says: Without **Dù** (度), **guī** (规) is not applied—ghosts will laugh and ridicule.\n**Zǐ** (訾), pronounced *zhǐ* (紫), also read as *jí* (即) *yí* (移).\n**Wáng** (王) says: The **Seventh (day)**, residing in excess,\nloses its station at night—hence it is not **Dù** (度).\n**Dù** (度) is the one who establishes **guīzhì** (规制).\n**Zǐ** (訾) is mockery and ridicule.\n\n「Praise says: Ghosts mock, *Cè* says: Those who keenly observe.\nThe **幽明** (Yōumíng—\"dark and bright,\" i.e., the unseen and the seen) share in laughter,\nhence the parallel phrasing reveals its meaning.\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: The **Seventh (day)**, marked by ruin and decay, falls at night.\nThe **xiǎorén** (小人—\"petty/ignoble person\") grows arrogant and extravagant,\nnot restraining himself by **fǎdù** (法度—\"law and measure\"),\nso the ghosts mock and ridicule him, and disaster will befall him.\n\nThose who keenly observe—none surpass the ghosts.\nAmong the foolish of humanity, some may not yet know it,\nbut the ghosts first perceive the coming calamity.\n\n**Eighth (day):** The **stone** (石) does not lose its **chì** (赤—\"redness\"),\na steadfast person’s essential virtue.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: The **stone** (石) does not lose its **chì** (赤—\"redness\"),\nand thus one may entrust him with great matters.\n\n**Yào** (要), pronounced as *yáo* (一遥切).\n**Fàn** (范) says: The stone cannot lose its firmness,\nthe cinnabar cannot lose its redness.\n\n**Wáng** (王) says: The **Eighth (day)**, at the end of **Dù** (度—\"measure\"),\nsecures its station at dawn—one who must uphold his **Dù** (度—\"measure\")\nand never alter it.\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: **Yào** (要) means \"to bind by agreement.\"\nThe **Eighth (day)**, though in the midst of disaster, stands at dawn.\nThe **junzi** (君子), even amid calamity and chaos,\ndoes not change his **Dù** (度—\"measure\"),\nholding fast to his resolve with unyielding clarity—\nunmovable, unshakable.\nHence, one may make a binding agreement with him,\nsaying: \"To entrust him with a hundred *lǐ* (里—\"li, a unit of distance\") of command,\nto place him as guardian of the six *chǐ* (尺—\"feet\") of an orphan.\"\n\n**Ninth (day):** The **accumulation of errors** (积差) is forgiven,\nyet ten years pass without return.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: The **accumulation of errors** (积差) is forgiven,\nbut no further progress can be made.\n\n**Fàn** (范) originally wrote \"difference\" (差) as \"goodness\" (善),\nbut now follows the readings of the *Èr Sòng* (二宋—\"Two Song editions\"),\n*Lù* (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.\nThe **Wáng** (王) edition writes \"ten\" (十) as \"seven\" (七),\nbut now follows the consensus of other editions.\n**Lù** (陆) says: **Zào** (造) means \"to reach/attain.\"\n**Wáng** (王) says: At the extreme of **Dù** (度—\"measure\"),\nlosing its station at night—one who has utterly abandoned **Dù** (度—\"measure\").\nHe accumulates his errors and deviations,\ngradually drifting farther astray.\n\"Forgiven\" (贷) means leniency and delay,\ncoming too late in time.\nThough seven years may pass—how long!—\nhis **Dù** (度—\"measure\") can never be restored.\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: \"Forgiven\" (贷) should be read as *tuōdé* (吐得切),\nsame as **tè** (忒—\"exceedingly, overly\"),\nthe utmost degree of error.\nThe *Yì* (易) says: \"To return in confusion is inauspicious.\"\nEven ten years of campaigning cannot conquer it.\nThe two **Sòng** (宋) editions, **Lù** (陆), **Fàn** (范), and **Wáng** (王)\nall liken it to the **Héng** (恒—\"constancy\") hexagram.\n**Wú** (吴) says: \"Constant head\" (常首),\nlikening it to the **Héng** (恒—\"constancy\") hexagram.\n\nThe **Seventh (day)**, marking the start of autumn.\n**First (day):** Corresponds to the **226th day**,\nadvancing the **Yì** (翼—\"auxiliary\") by **15°**,\naligning with the **Héng** (恒—\"constancy\") hexagram in the *Yì* (易) for the day's significance.\n**Fourth (day):** The next **auxiliary** (翼), likening it to the **Jié** (节—\"propriety\") hexagram.\n**First (day):** Having already advanced **Yì** (翼—\"auxiliary\") by **2°**,\nnow reaching **Yǒng** (永—\"enduring\").\n\nThe **Seventh (day)**, corresponds to the **238th day**,\nadvancing **Yì** (翼—\"auxiliary\") by **9°**,\naligning with the **Tóngrén** (同人—\"harmony with others\") hexagram in the *Yì* (易) for the day's significance.\nNow following this.\n\n**Yīn** (阴—\"dark, feminine, passive\") uses **wǔ** (武—\"martial, force\") to take,\n**Yáng** (阳—\"bright, masculine, active\") uses **wén** (文—\"cultural,

**wǔ** (武—\"martial, force\").\n**Yáng** (阳—\"bright, masculine, active\") is the **qì** (气) of **virtue/power** (德),\nhence it is spoken of in terms of **wén** (文—\"cultural, refinement\").\n**Wǔ** (武—\"martial, force\") supplements **wén** (文—\"cultural, refinement\"),\nand **wén** (文—\"cultural, refinement\") supplements **wǔ** (武—\"martial, force\"),\nthe **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of **yīn** (阴) and **yáng** (阳) in taking and giving—\nhence its **Dao** (道—\"Way\") can endure forever.\n\n**First (day):** Without **tì** (替—\"replacement\") or **shuàng** (爽—\"freshness, clarity\"),\nthe enduring principle of the eldest son.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: Without **tì** (替—\"replacement\") or **shuàng** (爽—\"freshness, clarity\"),\nit is the eternal continuation of the **Dao** (道—\"Way\").\n\n**Wáng** (王) edition writes **tì** (替) as **lì** (历—\"to pass through\"),\nsaying it is an ancient **jiàn** (僭—\"usurp\") character,\nbut now follows the readings of **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Fàn** (范) editions.\n**Cháng** (长), pronounced as *zhīzàng* (知丈切).\n**Yǒng** (永) means \"long-lasting, enduring,\"\nhaving the symbol of succession.\n**Tì** (替) means \"to abandon, to discard.\"\nOn the first day of dawn, one who attains the **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of endurance.\n\nThe **institutions of the ancient kings** (先王之制),\nestablishing the **dí** (嫡—\"legitimate heir\") to endure,\nto secure the **Zōngmiào** (宗庙—\"ancestral temples\") and **chóngshèjì** (社稷—\"altars of soil and grain\"),\nwithout replacement or loss of clarity—\nthe eternal law for ten thousand generations.\nNo **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of endurance surpasses this.\n\n**Second (day):** Harboring within himself **tì** (替—\"replacement\") and **shuàng** (爽—\"freshness, clarity\"),\nhe will forever lose the **Zhēnxiáng** (贞祥—\"auspicious virtue\").\n\n**Cè** (测) says: Harboring within himself **tì** (替—\"replacement\") and **shuàng** (爽—\"freshness, clarity\"),\nhow can such stability endure?\nOn the second day, at night, he loses the **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of endurance.\n\nA **confused and deluded ruler** (昏惑之君),\nviolating propriety by favoring a concubine,\nreplacing the legitimate heir with a bastard,\nharbors within himself the **qì** (气) of **tì** (替—\"replacement\") and **shuàng** (爽—\"freshness, clarity\").\nIf he treats his eldest son in this manner,\nhe will forever lose the **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of upright goodness.\n\n**Third (day):** Enduring his **Dao** (道—\"Way\"),\nyet still without blame.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: Enduring his **Dao** (道—\"Way\"),\ntruly it may be preserved.\nThe **Third (day)**, marking the completion of intention,\nstands at dawn.\nThe **junzi** (君子) has already established his **Dao** (道—\"Way\") and deeds,\nyet has not yet ascended to fortune and rank.\nIf the **junzi** does not fear lack of position,\nbut fears how he establishes himself,\nconstantly renewing his **Dao** (道—\"Way\"),\nenduring without weariness—\nthough he may not yet attain blessings and prosperity,\nwhat blame is there?\n\n**Fourth (day):** The son does not follow his proper order,\nthe guest precedes, and the host forever loses his rightful place.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: The son does not follow his proper order,\nthis is not the **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of endurance.\n**Wáng** (王) says: The **Fourth (day)**, near the **Fifth (day)**,\nyet occupies a **yīn** (阴—\"dark, feminine, passive\") position in **yáng** (阳—\"bright, masculine, active\"),\nand falls at night—\nhe loses the **Dao** (道—\"Way\") of what may endure.\nIf the son does not occupy his proper place in order,\nthen sacrifices and guests will forever lack a host.\nHence, the guest precedes, and the host forever loses his rightful place.\n\n**Fifth (day):** The **three bonds** (三纲) are attained at the central peak,\nHeaven forever grants its blessings.\n\n**Cè** (测) says: The endurance of the **three bonds** (三纲),\nits **Dao** (道—\"Way\") is long.\n**Wáng** (王) says: Occupying the center and embodying correctness,\nas the head of the household,\nsecuring his station at dawn,\npossessing the **virtue/power** (德) of a ruler—\nhe can make the **three bonds** (三纲) all attain their proper place within him.\nHeaven aids him, hence his blessings endure forever.\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: The **three bonds** (三纲) are:\nthe ruler as the bond for his subjects,\nthe father as the bond for his children,\nthe husband as the bond for his wife.\nThe **Fifth (day)**, marking central harmony,\nstands at dawn.\nThe ruler establishes the **three bonds** (三纲) to found the **Huángjí** (皇极—\"Supreme Polarity\"),\nforever preserving Heaven’s blessings.\n\n**Sixth (day):** Greatly enduring in blessings,\nhe reverses the **empty court** (虚庭),\nentering the **dark obscurity** (酋冥).\n\n**Cè** (测) says: Greatly enduring in blessings,\nblessings turn to ruin.\n**Fàn** (范) edition writes \"entering the **dark obscurity** (入于酋冥)\" as \"entering the **obscurity** (入酋冥)\",\nthe *Xiǎo Sòng* (小宋—\"Lesser Song\") edition reads \"at the **obscurity** (於酋冥)\",\nbut now follows the readings of **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.\nThe **Sixth (day)**, exceeding the center and falling at night.\nThe **xiǎorén** (小人—\"petty/ignoble person\"), relying on the endurance of blessings,\nbecomes proud and licentious, boastful and arrogant.\nWhen blessings reach their end, disaster follows.\nHence, he reverses the **empty court** (虚庭),\nspeaking of gaining nothing.\nEntering the **dark obscurity** (酋冥),\nspeaking of his ignorance of remorse and fear—\nonce disaster has already befallen,\nhe reaches the utmost of **obscurity** (冥).\n\n**Seventh (day):** The **old wood** (老木) produces shade,\nenduring its own form.\n\n「**Kūn** (昆—\"to gather/cluster\"), pronounced *shì lì* (时吏切).\n**King Wén** (王) says: The seventh hexagram marks the completion of the **Kūn** cycle, its symbol being **old wood** (老木).\n\nYet when it holds its position during the day, it attains the **perfecting Dao** (永道), hence it generates **Kūn** (莳).\n**Kūn** (莳) refers to the **lateral growth** (旁生) of planting.\nOnce it bears **blossoms and leaves** (华叶), it further attains **prolonged duration** (长久),\nbeginning with **nothingness** (无今有), hence it is said to **entwine what does not exist** (缠其所无).\n\n**Eighth (day):** The **perfecting Dao** (永) lacks **proper measure** (轨),\nand **disaster** (凶亡) ensues, flowing onward to the future.\n**Zhōu** (测) says: The **perfecting Dao** lacking **proper measure** (永不轨),\nits **fate is exhausted** (命剂).\n**Jì** (剂), pronounced *cái zhì* (才诣切).\n**Sòng** (宋) says: **Jì** (剂) means **to trim** (翦).\n**King Wén** says: Dwelling in the position of **extremity** (极之位),\nwhile the **yin** (阴) occupies the **yang** time (阳时) and it is night—\nthis is an act where the **perfecting Dao** (永) does not follow **proper measure** (法).\nHow much less can it avoid bringing **disaster** (凶亡) to itself alone?\nThe **disaster** (凶亡) will then **flow into the future** (流于后).\n\n**Guāng** (光) says: The eighth hexagram is the **midpoint of calamity** (祸中),\nand it falls at night.\nThe **petty/ignoble person** (小人) persistently acts without **proper measure** (不法).\nOnce his body meets **disaster** (凶亡), the **remaining misfortunes** (余殃) will **flow into the future** (流后).\n\n**Uppermost ninth (day):** The **perfecting Dao** (永) concludes with **docile submission** (驯首).\n**Zhōu** says: The **perfecting Dao** concluding with **docile submission** (永终驯首),\nthis is the **enduring virtue of harmony** (长恺悌).\n**Xún** (驯) means **to comply** (顺).\n**Kǎi** (恺) means **joy** (乐).\n**Tì** (悌) means **ease** (易).\nThe ninth line, at the **end of the perfecting Dao** (永终), falls during the day.\nThe **Dao of the noble person** (君子之道) is **enduring, joyful, and easy** (永长乐易),\nand he **treats the end as the beginning** (慎终如首若一).\nThus, the **perfecting Dao** is **fulfilled** (全).\n\n---\n**The two directions, three regions, three divisions, and three families** (二方三州三部三家) **all gather** (昆).\n**Kūn** (昆), pronounced *hù gǔn* (户衮切), or as the character itself.\n**Yin-family metal** (阴家金) also aligns with **the people** (同人).\n**Lù** (陆) says: **Kūn** (昆) also means **to align** (同).\nThe **yin** (阴) is about to **depart** (离), while the **yang** (阳) still **gathers** (昆).\nThe **Dao of gathering** (昆道) still aligns.\n\n**Sòng** (宋) says: The **yin-qi** (阴气) is about to **kill** (杀),\nhence it **departs and scatters all things** (离散万物).\nThe **yang-qi** (阳气) is about to **converge** (藏),\nhence all things **return and align** (同归).\n**King Wén** says: The **yin-qi** (阴气) governs **killing** (杀),\nand it **departs from all things** (离万物).\nThe **yang-qi** (阳气) embodies **benevolence and love** (仁爱),\nstill **gathering and aligning** (犹尚昆而同之).\n\n**First (day):** **Gathering in darkness** (昆于黑),\nhe does not know **light** (白).\n**Zhōu** says: **Gathering in darkness** (昆于黑),\nthis is not to be called a **person** (人).\n**Sòng** says: **White** (白) means **wisdom** (智).\n**Black** (黑) means **folly** (愚).\n**Guāng** says: **Darkness** (黑) signifies **filth and turbidity** (垢浊),\n**light** (白) signifies **purity and integrity** (廉洁).\nThe first hexagram marks the **beginning of contemplation** (思始),\nand it falls at night.\nThe **petty/ignoble person** (小人) aligns himself with **filth and turbidity** (垢浊),\nand does not recognize **purity and integrity** (廉洁) as **beauty** (美).\n\n**Second (day):** **White and black intermingle** (白黑菲菲),\nthree **beasts** (禽) share one **horn** (角) with **aligned tails** (同尾).\n**Zhōu** says: Three **beasts** (禽) sharing one **horn** (角),\nthis brings no **harm to the heart** (害心).\n**Fěi** (菲), pronounced *fū wěi* (敷尾切), is the same as **fěi** (斐).\n**King Wén** says: It holds its position during the day.\n**White and black intermingling** (白黑菲菲) signifies the **distinction between clarity and obscurity** (分别明白之义).\nThree **beasts** (禽) refer to **three people** (三人).\nOne **horn** (角) with **aligned tails** (同尾) means **beginning and end are all aligned** (终始皆同),\nwith no **contrariness or divergence** (无乖异).\n\n**Guāng** says: **Intermingling** (菲菲) describes the **appearance of white and black blending** (白黑相杂貌).\nA **horn** (角) is what **repels assaults** (拒斗) at the head.\nA **tail** (尾) is the **end of the body** (体之终).\nThe second hexagram marks the **midpoint of contemplation** (思中),\nand it falls during the day.\nThe **noble person** (君子) interacts with others,\n**pure yet not piercing** (廉而不刿),\n**obscure yet not defiling** (浊而不污).\nIn **intermingling harmony** (菲菲), they **coexist without disorder** (群居而不乱).\nOne **horn** (角) signifies **united defense against insult** (共御侮).\n**Aligned tails** (同尾) signify **preserving the end** (全其终).\n\n**Confucius** says: The **noble person aligns yet does not conform** (君子和而不同).\n\n**Third (day):** **Gathering in light** (昆于白),\nhe **loses what does not align with darkness** (失不黑),\nwith **boundless alignment at the tail** (无际一尾) and **three horns** (三角).\n**Zhōu** says: **Gathering in light** (昆白) and **not aligning with darkness** (不黑),\nthis is **lacking mutual affinity** (不相亲).\nThe **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) editions read **际** (际) as **chú** (除),\nbut now follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lù** (陆) editions.\n\n**Fourth (day):** A **bird** (鸟) **entrusts its nest** (托巢) to the **withered grass** (菆),\na **person** (人) **entrusts his life** (寄命) to the **public** (公).\n**Zhōu** says: A **bird entrusting its nest** (鸟托巢),\nthe **public** (公) will have no **poverty** (无贫).\nThe **Fàn** (范) and **Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) editions read **菆** (菆) as **cóng** (丛),\nbut now follows the **Sòng** (宋), **Lù** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) editions.\n**Chóu** (菆) is the ancient form of **cóng** (丛).\n**Sòng** says: **Public** (公) means **equitable** (均).\n**Guāng** says: The **public** (公) embodies the **Dao of great unity** (道大同),\nwith no **distinction of self and others** (无彼我也).\nThe fourth hexagram marks the **lower position of gathering** (下禄),\nand it falls during the day.\nIf the **noble person** (君子) can **extend the heart of great unity** (推大同至公之心)\nto **treat others** (以待人),\nthen all will **return and entrust their lives** (皆归往而寄命).\nHence, it is said: The **public** (公) will have no **poverty** (无贫).\n\n**Fifth (day):** The **valley** (谷) **loses its spacing and order** (失疏数),\nand the **crowd consumes** (众牦) the **jade** (玉).\n**Zhōu** says: The **valley losing its spacing and order** (谷失疏数),\nhow can it **fulfill its equitable measure** (奚足旬)?\nThe **Fàn** (范) and **Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) editions read **谷失疏数** (谷失疏数) as **谷不谷** (谷不谷),\n**losing its spacing and order** (失疏数).\nThe **Wáng** (王) edition reads **毂不毂** (毂不毂),\n**losing its spacing and order** (失疏数).\nNow follows the **Sòng** (宋) and **Lù** (陆) editions.\n**Gǔ** (谷) and **gǔ** (毂) are ancient characters interchangeable.\n**Lù** says: **Xún** (旬) means **equitable** (均).\n**King Wén** says: The fifth line dwells in the **position of preeminence** (盛位),\nand should act as the **master of things** (物主).\nYet the **yang** (阳) occupies the **yin position** (阴位) and it is night—\nit does not attain the **Dao of harmonious blending** (混同之道).\nThe **hub** (毂) is **surrounded by spokes** (为众辐所凑).\nSince the fifth line has **lost the Dao** (失道),\nit cannot **encompass all things**.\nHence, it is said: The **hub loses its function** (毂不毂).\n\nThe **lightness of the crowd’s consumption** (众耗之轻),\nwhen accumulated, becomes **great** (成多),\nand will inevitably lead to **the jade being ruined** (毁玉之患),\nas when **many mouths melt gold** (众口铄金).\n\n**Guāng** says: The **hub** (毂) receives the **spokes** (辐),\nand **spacing and order must be equitable** (疏数必均),\nonly then can it **rotate and function** (运行).\nThe fifth line, though a **petty/ignoble person** (小人),\ndwells in the **position of preeminence** (盛位).\nWithout the **heart of great unity** (至公之心),\nhis **likes and dislikes are private** (好恶任私).\nHence, **slander and deceit** (谗慝) advance together,\nand the **crowd consumes the jade** (众牦毁玉).\n\n**Sixth (day):** **Gathering at the well and marketplace** (昆于井市),\n**wagons of the same script align on the same tracks** (文车同轨).\n**Zhōu** says: **Gathering at the well and marketplace** (昆于井市),\nthis signifies **unity in rank and order** (同一伦).\nThe **well and marketplace** (井市) are where **people congregate** (人所聚).\nThe sixth hexagram marks the **height of abundance** (盛多) during the day.\nThe **Dao of the noble person** (君子道) is **profound in virtue and abundant** (隆德盛),\nand the **four seas converge** (四海会向).\n**Script is unified** (书同文), **wagons share the same tracks** (车同轨),\nwith no **far or near** (无有远迩),\nall **blending into one category** (混为一类).\n\n**Seventh (day):** The **cover is lopsided and does not shelter** (盖偏不覆),\nthe **late rain does not rescue** (晏雨不救).\n**Zhōu** says: The **cover is lopsided and does not shelter** (盖偏不覆),\nthis signifies **virtue not being equitable** (德不均).\n**Fù** (覆), pronounced *fū jiù* (敷救切), same below.\n**Yàn** (晏), means **late** (晚).\nRain that comes **late** (晚) means\nthe **young plants flourish** (稚者昌) while the **established ones are harmed** (植者伤).\nThe seventh hexagram marks **decay and loss** (败损) during the night.\nThe **petty/ignoble person’s virtue** (小人之德),\ncannot achieve **great unity** (大同),\nhis **intentions are skewed** (用心颇僻),\nwith **favoritism and prejudice** (有爱有恶).\nLike a **lopsided cover** (盖偏),\nthere will be **things left unsheltered** (物有不覆者).\nLike **late rain** (雨晚),\nthere will be **crops left unrescued** (禾有不救者).\n\n**Eighth (day) and second (day) of Kūn:** **Gathering in peril and adversity** (二昆于危难),\nnow **turning to shelter and safety** (乃覆之安).\n**Zhōu** says: **Safety in peril and adversity** (危难之安),\nthis is the **fruit of prior benevolence** (素施仁).\nThe eighth hexagram marks the **midpoint of calamity** (祸中),\n**exhaustion and peeling away** (为耗为剥落),\nand carries the **symbol of peril and adversity** (有危难之象).\n\nThus, during the day of **Kūn** (昆),\nthe **noble person** (君子) naturally practices the **Dao of universal unity** (昆同之道),\nspreading **benevolent love** (泛爱) and **embracing the multitude** (容众),\ntreating all with **equal regard** (一视同仁).\nTherefore, in times of **peril and adversity** (危难之际),\nhe can **shelter and protect** (庇覆於物) all things,\nbringing them to **safety and ease** (使之就安).\n\n**Ninth line (day):** **Kūn** at the point of **death** (昆于死),\nabandoning the **bandit** (寇) and discarding him.\n**Zhōu** says: **Kūn** at death (昆于死),\nthis is to **abandon one’s own body** (弃厥身).\n**遗** (遗), pronounced with the *yǒu* (醉) rhyme.\n\n**King Wáng** (王) says: To **abandon one’s body** (弃身) and **discard the bandit** (遗寇),\nthis is the **height of misfortune** (凶之甚).\n**Guāng** (光) remarks: **Evil deeds differ in kind** (为恶不同),\nyet all lead to **chaos and disorder** (同归于乱).\nThe **ninth line** (九) stands at the **extreme of calamity** (祸极),\nand corresponds to the **night** (当夜),\nthus bearing this **symbol** (象).\n\n---\n\n**The Fivefold Division of the Day (三方一州一部一家减):**\n**Yang** (阳) **family** (家) **Water** (水), **harmonizing with decline** (准损).\n**First line (day):** **Decline enters** (入减), **beginning at one** (初一),\nforty-one **degrees and seventeen seconds** (分一十七秒),\naligning with the **Lesser Heat** (处暑) **qi** (气).\n\n**Second line (day):** **The day relinquishes its sorrow** (日舍轸).\n**Yin** (阴) **qi** (气) **wanes** (息),\n**Yang** (阳) **qi** (气) **fades** (消).\nWhen **Yin prevails and Yang wanes** (阴盛阳衰),\nall things **grow subtle and faint** (万物以微).\nThe **King Wáng** (王) text reads: **Yin wanes, Yang fades** (阴息阳消),\nwhile the **minor Sòng** (小宋) text reads: **All Yin wanes** (群阴息),\n**Yang fades** (阳气消).\nNow following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Fàn** (宋、陆、范) texts.\n\n**First line (day):** **Good decline, no decline** (善减不减),\n**obscurity** (冥).\n**Zhōu** says: **Good decline, no decline** (善减不减),\nthis is **constant self-abnegation** (常自冲).\n**Lǚ** (陆) says: **Suāng** (冲) means **emptiness** (虚).\n**Guāng** (光) remarks: **One** (一) marks **the beginning of reflection** (思始),\nyet corresponds to the **day** (当昼).\nConstantly **abasing oneself in humility** (自谦冲),\nthis is **good decline** (善减).\nThe **self-abased** (自损者),\nothers **benefit them** (益之),\nthus there is **no decline** (不减).\n**One** (一) is **lowest of the low** (下下),\n**good decline** (善减) as **humility** (谦),\n**no decline** (不减) as **benefit** (益),\nboth rooted in **obscure depths** (冥昧之中),\nwhere **none can see** (人莫得而见),\nhence the term **obscure** (冥).\n\n**Second line (day):** **Decline of the heart** (心减),\n**self-abased from within** (自中),\nto **manifest in form upon the body** (以形于身).\n**Zhōu** says: **Decline of the heart, form upon the body** (心减形身),\nthis is **inner constraint** (困诸中).\nThe **Sòng and Lǚ** (宋、陆) texts read **form as punishment** (刑),\nnow following the **Fàn and Wáng** (范、王) texts.\n\nWhen a person **advances in virtue and cultivates their path** (进德修业),\nthey must **first strengthen their heart** (必自强於心),\nthen **display it outwardly** (然后显着於外).\n**Two** (二) marks **the midpoint of reflection** (思中),\nyet corresponds to the **night** (当夜).\n**Intent** (志) **declines first** (先减矣),\nhow then can **virtue and deeds** (德业) **increase** (何从而益)?\nThis is **constraint from within** (是其中先自困).\n\nThe **Master** (子) said to **Rǎn Qiú** (冉求):\n*\"Those lacking strength* (力不足者),\n*fail midway* (中道而废),\n*yet you persist in your designs.*\" (今汝画)\n\n**Third line (day):** **Decline in one’s bearing** (减其仪),\n**advantageous to use brightness** (利用光) **on the steps** (于阶).\n\n「The **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining in one’s bearing** (减其仪) is **self-restraint** (欲自禁也).\n**Three** (三) marks the **interaction between lower and upper** (下上),\n**the culmination of reflection** (思终),\n**and the advancement of the people** (进人).\nResiding in the upper position **brings excess pride and arrogance** (则多骄盈),\n**culminating in reflection** (思终) **manifests outwardly** (形於外#2).\nWhen one’s bearing is declined, it is **self-deprecation and restraint** (自贬损，禁约也).\nThe **steps** (阶#3) are **the means of advancement** (所以进也#4).\nThrough self-deprecation yet attaining advancement, there is **radiance and splendor** (有光辉也).\n\n**Fourth line (day):** **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾),\n**lowering one’s station** (贬其位).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾) is **unfit to govern the multitude** (无以莅众也).\nThe **Fàn** (范) text renders 艾 as 乂, now following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Wáng** (宋、陆、王) texts.\n艾 and 乂 share the same pronunciation.\n**Fàn** (范) states: 乂 is **governance** (治也#5).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **Four** (四) represents **lowering in fortune** (下禄),\nyet corresponds to the **day** (当昼).\nThe **petty person** (小人) who **lacks diligence in governance** (不勤於为治),\n**cannot govern the multitude** (无以临众#6),\nand thus **cannot preserve their station** (则不能保其禄位矣).\nHence it is said: **Decline at the threshold** (减於艾),\n**lowering one’s station** (贬其位).\n\n**Fifth line (day):** **Declining the yellow constancy** (减黄贞),\n**the lower supporting the upper** (下承于上),\n**tranquility** (宁).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining the yellow constancy** (减黄贞) is **the proper way of the subject** (臣道丁也).\nThe **Fàn** (范) text reads **declining its yellow constancy** (减其黄贞),\nnow following the other texts.\n**Sòng** (宋) states: 丁 means **appropriate** (当也).\n**Wáng** (王) says: **One attains station during the day** (得位当昼),\n**able to decline in serving the master** (能为减主),\n**and also gains the central yellow** (又得黄中),\n**the path of upright constancy** (贞正之道),\n**where all people converge** (众所咸归),\nhence the lower supports the upper, and **tranquility is achieved** (而获安宁之福也).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **Five** (五) is **the peak of harmony** (中和莫盛乎),\nhence it is said **yellow** (黄).\n**Uprightness in station** (以阳当位) is why it is called **constancy** (贞).\nWhen **prosperity reaches its peak** (夫盛极),\n**it must decline** (则衰),\n**and decline is inevitable** (不可不减).\nIf the subject **employs this path to support their superior** (臣用此道以承其上),\nthen **they may attain their own tranquility** (乃可自安),\nhence it is said: **The way of the subject is appropriate** (臣道当也).\n\n**Sixth line (day):** **Gathering in obscurity** (幽阐积),\n**neither closed nor spread** (不缄不施),\n**unyielding like stone** (石).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **Obscurity not spread** (幽阐不施) is **the waters not level** (泽不平也).\n施 is pronounced as **shī** (失豉切).\n**Fàn** (范) states: **Six** (六) is **water** (水),\nhence **gathering in obscurity** (积幽).\n**Xiǎo Sòng** (小宋) says: **Great openness is called 阐** (大开曰阐).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **Six** (六) and **the family’s nature** (家性) are both **water** (水),\nhence it is said **obscurity** (幽).\n**Six** (六) represents **lowering in fortune** (上禄),\nhence it is said **阐** (阐).\nIt also signifies **abundance and extremity** (又为盛多为极大),\nhence it is said **gathering** (积).\nThe **Noble Person** (君子) should **augment the few and diminish the many** (当裒多益寡),\n**adjusting to things and spreading evenly** (称物平施).\nNow, **neither diminishing nor spreading** (今乃不减不施),\n**their obstinacy is like stone** (其顽如石),\nhence it is said: **the waters are not level** (泽不平也).\n\n**Seventh line (day):** **Declining their affliction** (减其疾),\n**reducing their care** (损其恤),\n**harshness does not reach** (厉不至).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **Declining their affliction** (减其疾) is **avoiding peril** (不至危也).\n**Fàn** (范) states: **恤** (恤) means **grief** (忧也).\n**厉** (厉) means **peril** (危也).\n**Wáng** (王) says: **Seven** (七) **resides in overfullness** (居过满),\n**the path of peril** (危之道也).\nYet **one attains station during the day** (而得位当昼),\n**able to decline their afflictions** (是能自减其疾患),\n**reduce their grief** (损其忧戚),\nthen **harshness has no way to reach** (则厉无从而至矣).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **Seven** (七) is **the beginning of calamity** (祸始),\nyet corresponds to the **day** (当昼),\n**lying in the realm of the declining family** (在於减家),\nhence this **symbol** (故有是象).\nThe *Yì* (易) says: **Reduce their affliction,\nso that they may swiftly have joy** (损其疾，使遄有喜).\n\n**Eighth line (day):** **Flowing waves** (浏涟涟),\n**declining at the source of life** (减于生根).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **The decline of flowing waves** (浏涟之减) is **the roots being destroyed** (生根毁也).\nThe **Wáng** (王) text lacks the **下涟** (下涟) character,\nnow following the **Sòng, Lǚ, and Fàn** (宋、陆、范) texts.\n浏 is pronounced as **liú** (音留) or **lìjiǔ** (力久切).\n涟 is pronounced as **lián** (音连).\n**Fàn** (范) states: **Eight** (八) is **wood** (木).\n**Wood begins to decline in autumn** (秋木始衰).\n**浏** (浏) is **dripping** ().\n**涟涟** (涟涟) is **the appearance of dripping** (垂之貌).\n**Dripping** () is an ancient form of **流** (流).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **Eight** (八) is **wood** (木),\n**the sinking of heaven** (沈天),\n**lingering sickness** (疾瘀),\n**consumption** (耗),\n**and peeling away** (剥落).\n**The sinking of heaven** (沈天) refers to **the transition between autumn and winter** (秋冬之交).\n**Wood’s vitality** (木之所以生者) depends on **its roots** (根也).\n**Its flourishing** (所以荣者) relies on **its nourishing fluids** (滋液也).\nNow, **the nourishing fluids drip downward** (今滋液下流),\n**yet the roots, the source of life, are declined** (涟涟，然减其资生之根),\n**how then can it still flourish?** (则何以复能盛荣乎?)\n\n**Uppermost ninth line (day):** **The culmination of decline** (减终),\n**advantageous to ascend the Western Mountain** (利用登于西山),\n**and overlook the great river** (临于大川).\nThe **Diviner** (测) said: **Ascending in the culmination of decline** (减终之登) is **truly achievable** (诚可为也).\n**Fàn** (范) states: **Being in the West signifies metal** (在西为金),\nhence it is said **Western Mountain** (西山).\n**Metal generates water** (金生水),\nhence it is said **great river** (大川).\n**Guāng** (光) explains: **When things reach their extreme** (物极则反),\n**the culmination of decline must increase** (故减终必增).\n**Ascending the mountain and overlooking the river** (登山临川) is **to stand high over the low** (以高临下也#7).\n**The West** (西) is **the completion of things** (物之成).\n**Standing high over the low** (夫登高临下) is **rarely without peril** (鲜有不危),\nyet **declining in this position makes it achievable** (以减处之，故可为也).\n\n**Three regions, one state, two families** (三方一州一部二家唫).\n**Yin family, fire** (阴家火),\n**corresponding to the negative** (准否).」\n\nThe **Chen** (陈) pronunciation is **Qín** (钦), also **Qín** (琴), pronounced as *jùjǐn* in both Small Song and Wu dialects. The *Shuōwén Jiězì* states: \"To speak urgently, the same as *jǐn* (噤).\" We follow this today.\n\nLu (陆) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) means \"closed and sealed.\" When **Yin** (阴) does not transform, and **Yang** (阳) does not act, all things are sealed.\n\nIn general, when **Yang** (阳) applies its essence and **Yin** (阴) shapes its form, all things come to life. But during the **Chùshǔ** (处暑) season, when **Yin** (阴) does not transform and **Yang** (阳) does not act, all things are sealed.\n\nOn the first day, **\"Lì\"** (唫) does not give, and men dwell like women. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) does not give, which is contrary to human nature. **\"Yǔ\"** (予) is the same as **\"yǔ\"** (与). **Wáng** (王) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) is to close oneself off and not engage with others, like a man imitating a woman’s seclusion. **Guāng** (光) says: One is the beginning of thought, occurring at night, dwelling in the depths below. The **junzi** (君子) contemplates the **Dao** (道) and seeks to extend it to others, yet now he is sealed and does not engage—like a man dwelling as a woman does.\n\nA solitary person without kin will be shunned by all, hence it is said, \"contrary to human nature.\"\n\nOn the second day, **\"lì\"** (唫) is in the blood, nourishing the **Qián** (乾) bones. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the blood makes one emaciated yet fattened. **Fàn** (范) originally wrote **\"zāi\"** (臞), pronounced *yūfù*, but all other versions write **\"zāi\"** (臞), with Small Song pronouncing it *jù* and Wu *qú*; we follow this. **Wáng** (王) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the blood nourishes the **Qián** (乾) bones, fearing emaciation and seeking to fatten oneself. **Guāng** (光) says: Two is the middle of thought, occurring in the day, able to accumulate **virtue** (德) to beautify the body. The *Dàxué* (大学) says: *\"Wealth moistens the house, **virtue** moistens the body.\"*\n\nOn the third day, the face does not engage, the mouth **chā** (唭), and **\"lì\"** (唫) has no words. **Cè** (测) says: The face does not engage, and human conduct is faint. **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) omit the mouth radical; we follow Small Song, Lu, and the second Song versions. **Chā** (唭) is pronounced *qùlì*, and **\"yù\"** (唭) is pronounced *yújì*. **Fàn** (范) says: **Chā** (唭) is sound without words. **Wáng** (王) says: Human conduct nearly reaches extinction. **Guāng** (光) says: Three is the end of thought, and also the completion of intention. Once thought is complete, speech and appearance can engage with others. But if the family nature is sealed, even during the day, it remains closed and unengaged—human conduct nearly vanishes. The *Yì* (易) *Jié* (节) hexagram, line two, says: *\"Not going out of the gate or courtyard—disaster.\"*\n\nOn the fourth day, **\"lì\"** (唫) is in the grains, neither thriving nor common, burdening the old and the clan. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the grains means they cannot be shared.\n\nOn the fifth day, neither central nor supervising, the stingy decay of rot and worms. **Cè** (测) says: Neither central nor supervising—this **\"lì\"** (唫) is wrong. Small Song says: *\"Salaries await the worthy, yet granaries overflow with rotting grain—still they are stingy with their **lì** (唫)—this is wrong.\"* **Guāng** (光) says: **\"Dū\"** (督) is also **\"zhōng\"** (中). The **junzi** (君子) accumulates and knows how to disperse; if it should be sealed, then seal; if it should be applied, then apply. In the fifth position of abundance, the family nature is sealed, straying from the middle way during the day—thus rotting yet still stingy.\n\nOn the sixth day, springs and sources flow abundantly, sealed in hills and gardens. **Cè** (测) says: The sealing of springs and sources is not to be criticized. The second Song, Lu, and **Wáng** (王) versions write **\"yì\"** (议) instead of **\"jī\"** (讥); we follow **Fàn** (范). **Fàn** (范) says: Six is water, hence springs and sources. Hills and gardens are used to illustrate elevation. **Guāng** (光) says: Six is the peak of abundance, the utmost. To store water in high places and wait for the time to apply it means its reach is far. Today’s sealing is the means for tomorrow’s blessings—thus it is not to be criticized.\n\n---\n\nThe seventh day, stinginess affects the body, and the yellow flesh is ruined.\n**Cè** says: Stinginess affecting the body is harm to bone and flesh.\nThe **Wáng** version renders \"yellow flesh\" as \"yellow bone and flesh,\" but we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** versions.\n\nSeven represents decay and ruin, and it is also the time of night.\nYellow is the central point.\nBone and flesh reside in the center, hence \"yellow flesh.\"\n**Qi** and blood nourish the body; if stinginess does not extend to the four limbs, then bone and flesh are ruined.\nEnlightenment and blessings bind kin; if stinginess does not extend to the nine clans, then inner and outer relations are estranged.\n\nThe eighth day, stinginess meets misfortune; prayers with an ox resolve it.\n**Cè** says: Stinginess encountering misfortune is the proper cost.\n**Fàn** says: The ox is a great expense.\n**Wáng** says: Though excessive stinginess invites disaster, one can pray with an ox to avert calamity.\n**Guāng** says: Eight is the midpoint of misfortune, hence \"stinginess meets disaster.\"\nThe night’s omen is thus: \"Prayers with an ox resolve it.\"\nTo not spare expense in resolving disaster is the right way.\n\nThe ninth day, stinginess brings no rain; faith lies in dried meat.\n**Cè** says: Stinginess without rain—what can be hoped for?\n**Fàn** says: Faith is trust.\n**Wáng** says: Nine is the extreme of stinginess, yet it is night.\nYin and Yang are both closed, hence no rain.\n**Guāng** says: When nourishment is exhausted and no hope remains, it is indeed true that flesh dries into jerky.\nThis speaks of the ruler’s blessings failing, and the people suffering.\n\nThree regions, one state, and one clan guard together:\nThe Yang family guards wood—this is also the principle of negation.\nThe Yin guards the door, the Yang guards the gate; nothing disturbs them.\n\nThe first day, closing the doors and windows, guarding what is original.\n**Cè** says: Closing the doors and windows is a good way to hold what one has.\nThe **Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions render \"closing the doors and windows\" as \"closing the bright windows,\" but we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Fàn** versions.\n**Fàn** says: Doors and windows are companions and associates.\n**Guāng** says: The *Yì* says: \"Wandering to and fro, companions follow your thoughts.\"\nWhen the mind is moved by something, the thing responds in kind.\nWindows are for observing the outside.\nOriginal is the beginning.\nThe *Lèjì* says: \"Man is born and remains still, this is Heaven’s nature; moved by things, he acts, this is human nature.\"\nOne is the beginning of thought and the time of night; able to close the enticements of external companions and guard the original nature of what one possesses.\n\nThe second day, lost in self-guard, not as effective as the first’s holding.\n**Cè** says: Lost in self-guard, there is no proper means.\n**Sòng** says: *Yì* (以) is *yòng* (use).\nWithout proper use, self-guard is all there is.\n**Wáng** says: The second day guards its confusion, the first guards its way, hence the second is not as effective as the first.\n**Guāng** says: Two is the midpoint of thought, yet it is night; enticed by external things, lost in confusion, and failing to guard what it should.\nThe *Shū* says: \"Only the people are born with abundance; because of things, they change.\"\n\nThe third day, neither loss nor gain, coming and going in silence.\n**Cè** says: Neither loss nor gain is guarding one’s original state.\nThree is the stage of human progress, self-composure, and fulfilled intent—night’s omen.\nVirtue is completed within; able to guard without losing it.\nThe coming and going of external things—what loss or gain do they bring me?\nSilent and fulfilled? Trust without words.\nThe *Yì* says: \"Neither loss nor gain, coming and going in harmony.\"\n\nThe fourth day, the **Guān** (艮) symbol guards.\n**Cè** says: The **Guān** symbol’s guard is strict and without leniency.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** versions render \"the **Guān** symbol guards\" as \"the **Guān** (贝) symbol guards itself,\" while the **Xiǎo Sòng** version writes \"the **Guān** (貌) symbol guards,\" but we follow the **Wáng** version.\n**Sòng** says: *Guān* (贝) is pronounced *gǒu* (狗).\n**Lù** says: *Guān* ( ) is prohibition and restraint.\nThe **Guān** symbol, like a dog, cannot discern what is proper, only restraining.\n**Fàn** says: The **Guān** symbol is likeness, like a straw dog.\n**Guāng** says: *Guān* (贝) is pronounced *gǒu* (狗); it should read \"the **Guān** (艮) symbol is a mistake for *gǒu* (狗).\"\nThe **Guān** symbol, like a dog, is akin to saying \"the **Guān** symbol like a dragon.\"\n\nThe fifth day, guarding the center with harmony, binding the lords with sincerity.\n**Cè** says: Guarding the center with harmony is the nature of the lords.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** versions render \"binding the lords with sincerity\" as \"binding the center with one’s sincerity,\" while the **Wáng** version renders \"binding the lords with sincerity\" as \"binding the lords with their sincerity,\" but we follow the **Fàn** version.\n**Fàn** says: Five is the Son of Heaven; guarding the way of central harmony, the proper sovereign over all lords.\n**Guāng** says: Sincerity is alignment.\nNone excel in central harmony as much as Five.\nGuarding the way of central harmony, to bind the lords with sincerity, is the standard by which the lords are called and aligned.\n\nThe sixth day, chariot wheels halted, jade and jasper dusted.\n**Cè** says: Chariot wheels halted means no contact with neighbors.\nThe **Wáng** version renders \"no contact with neighbors\" as \"exchange with neighbors,\" but we follow the other versions.\n**Yùn** (轫), pronounced *rěn* (而振).\n**Xiǎo Sòng** says: **Yùn** (轫) is the wooden block that hinders chariot wheels.\nIn rituals for lords, weapons are not used; the lords themselves are the proper tools for order.\nLosing sincerity in guarding, no contact with neighboring states, chariot wheels halted and not moving, jade and jasper gathering dust and unused.\n**Guāng** says: The family nature is guarding; six exceeds the center and is night—a case of guarding too much.\n\nThe seventh day, the many Yang do not guard, the males’ sincerity.\n**Cè** says: The many Yang’s guard is guarding sincerity and trust.\nThe **Wáng** version omits \"do not guard,\" but we follow the other versions.\n\nThe eighth day, the mortar lacks its pestle, and its pestle is raised.\nHeaven is dark and does not rain, the bright day destroys the heat.\n**Cè** says: The mortar lacks its pestle—this is guarding poverty.\n**Wáng** says: A mortar without a pestle means guarding without any use.\nThe pestle is raised and does not descend—guarding without any fulfillment.\n**Guāng** says: Its pestle is raised—there is no grain to pound.\nHeaven is dark and does not rain; there is no nourishment to hope for.\nEight is the midpoint of misfortune, of depletion, hence this symbol.\n\nThe ninth at the top: **With Tu** there is guarding, and he speaks at Lu’s head—no peril.\n**Cè** says: With **Tu** there is guarding, hence it is ever renewed.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** versions read *has Tu has guarding*, while **Cè** reads *its Tu its guarding*; we follow the **Fàn**, **Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions.\n**Tu**, pronounced *tú*.\n**Sòng** says: *Què* means \"to surpass.\"\n**Fàn** says: **Tu** is white. **Lú** is black. Nine is the West, hence white.\n**Guāng** says: **Tu** is the flourishing of thatch, its color white.\nNine marks the end of calamity and faces the day—one who repents his misfortune.\nThus, he contemplates the old and wise with white hair, guarding his former Dao,\nand declines the black-haired, deceitful men of false speech—\nso the state does not fall into peril.\nThe *Qín Shì* says:\n*\"The brave warriors, their strength exhausted, yet I still have them.\nThe valiant fighters, their archery and charioteering unerring, yet I do not desire them.\"*\n\n**Yǐn** family gold, conforming to **Xùn**.\nEntering **Xùn**, five degrees, eighteen minutes thirty-four seconds—white dew qi responds.\nThe day follows the Star of Longevity, the Dipper in the **Yǒu** position, the **Nán Lǚ** pitch.\n**Lù** says: **Xùn** is \"enter.\"\n**Yù** is also \"enter.\"\n**Wáng** says: **Yù** means \"to gather.\"\n**Guāng** says: **Xùn** is the rooster, hence the image of many flying crows gathering.\n\nWhen **Yīn** comes, it acts contrary; when **Yáng** goes, it acts in harmony. Things retreat, descend, and assemble.\nThe **Sòng**, **Lù**, **Wáng** versions read *\"Yáng goes with harmony\"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.\n**Sòng** says: **Yīn** comes from below, hence it is called \"contrary.\"\n**Yáng** goes from above, hence it is called \"harmony.\"\n**Guāng** says: When **Yīn** rises, it harms things, hence \"contrary.\"\nWhen **Yáng** descends, it nurtures things, hence \"harmony.\"\n\nThe first day: **Raging** surges in darkness, gathering his resolve.\nThough he might wish to wander freely, Heaven does not grant it.\n**Cè** says: **Raging** surges in darkness—Heaven has not yet favored him.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** versions read *\"gathers his resolve\"* as *\"with gathering resolve\"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.\nThe **Fàn** version reads *\"wander freely\"* as *\"adroitly at ease\"*—we follow the **Sòng**, **Lù**, **Wáng** versions.\n**Wáng** says: *Zī* is the ancient form of *zī* (to nourish).\n**Guāng** says: One is the beginning of thought, and it faces night.\nThe petty man harbors evil intent, raging and surging in the murky depths, gathering his resolve inwardly.\nThough he might wish to wander freely, Heaven does not nourish it.\n\nThe second day: Gathering in darkness, he shoots true.\n**Cè** says: Gathering in darkness—this is upright yielding.\nThe **Wáng** version reads *\"upright yielding\"* as *\"upright bow\"*—we follow the other versions.\nYielding is the same as *yǔ* (to give).\nTwo is the midpoint of thought, facing the day.\nThe virtuous man has a good heart, also gathering inwardly in the murky depths.\nLike shooting—his resolve is upright, and when he releases, it never misses. Hence, *\"shoots true.\"*\nUpright yielding means \"only the upright is yielding.\"\n\nThe third day: Gathering to eat, **zhuó zhuó**.\n**Cè** says: Gathering to eat, **zhuó zhuó**—beneficial as dancing.\n**Zhuó**, pronounced *zhǔ*.\n**Fàn** says: **Zhuó zhuó** is the appearance of swift eating.\n**Wáng** says: **Zhuó zhuó** exhausts the grain—extreme greed.\nDesiring swift benefit, like dancing to the rhythm.\n**Guāng** says: Three is the completion of intent, facing night, near fortune.\nThe petty man, seeing fortune, is greedy and strives to seize it, leaving nothing untried.\n\nThe fourth day: Gathering his wings, beneficial to act.\n**Cè** says: Gathering his wings—friends assist.\nFour is lower fortune, also external \"other,\" facing the day’s light.\nLike crows gathering their wings, beneficial to act.\nThe scholar gains friends’ aid, beneficial for advancement.\n\nThe fifth day: Gathering his belly, avoiding the grain fields.\n**Cè** says: Gathering his belly—this is not how one gains renown.\nThe **Fàn**, **Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *\"avoiding the grain fields\"* as *\"avoiding the golden grain fields\"*—we follow the **Sòng** and **Lù** versions.\nThe **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** versions read *\"renown\"* as *\"advancement\"*—we follow the **Lù** and **Wáng** versions.\nFive is central fortune, also the belly, facing the night—\nhe can only gather his blessings for himself.\nThus, *\"gathering his belly.\"*\nOne who hoards for himself will surely be deprived—\nthis is the way to avoid fortune, much less fame.\n\nThe sixth day: Yellow heart, vast wings—gathering to the heavens.\n**Cè** says: Yellow heart, vast wings—beneficial to gain support.\nThe **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng** versions read *\"beneficial\"* as *\"harmonious\"*—we follow the **Fàn** version.\nSix is middle-high, hence called yellow.\n**Hóng** is the bird that flies highest.\nSix is also abundant and flourishing, dwelling in the peak of fortune, facing the day.\nThe virtuous man takes the Middle Way as his heart, with many supporters.\nLike the vast wings of the **Hóng**, his flight knows no bounds.\n\nThe seventh day: Gathering the snare, **zhuó zhuó**.\n**Cè** says: Gathering the snare, **zhuó zhuó**—suffering separation and harm.\n**Zhuó**, pronounced *zhuó*.\n**Fàn** says: Seven is the cord, the arrow.\nThe arrow uses a cord—this is the snare.\n**Guāng** says: Seven is the stage of calamity, facing night, hence suffering separation and harm.\n\nThe eighth day: Its **fàn**, severing its **jiān**—peril.\n**Cè** says: **Fàn**, severing **jiān**—dangerous yet fulfilled.\n**Fàn** is the same as *huī* (to swing).\n**Jiān**, pronounced *xiàn*.\n**Wáng** says: In daylight, one can still be in danger—\nthough not reaching ultimate calamity, it is extreme peril.\n**Xiǎo Sòng** says: **Fàn** is an overturned cart.\n**Jiān** is a net.\n**Guāng** says: Eight is the midpoint of calamity, facing the day, hence escape is possible.\n\nThe ninth at the top: Its horn—maintaining to subdue his kin.\n**Cè** says: Its horn—exterminating his kind.\n\n---\n\n**抵**, pronounced *zhǐ* (as in \"paper\").\n\n**Fàn** says: **抵** is to strike.\n**Wáng** says: Its horn#25, used to repel things—\nthings that share the same hatred.\n**Guāng** says: Nine is extermination, ultimate calamity, ferocity, the horn,\nand it faces the night.\nThough calamity rages unceasing, reaching its utmost extremity,\nit still seeks victory through ferocity, hence the destruction of one’s kin.\n\n**Three regions, one state, two departments, two clans gathered**—\n**Yáng**-clan’s earth, conforming to **Cùi** (Gathering).\nEntering the gathering, the seventh day, discards the horn.\nThe *Yì* (Book of Changes) says: **Cùi**, the **Wáng** (King) feigns a temple.\nThus, the gathering abounds with spirits and gods.\n\n**Yīn**-**qì** (vital breath) collects and gathers,\n**Yáng** (brightness) does not restrain or rule—\nthings gather and exalt one another.\n**Chóng** (exalt), also means to gather.\n\nThe first day: Spirits and gods are without form—**líng** (numinous).\n**Cè** says: Spirits and gods without **líng** (numinous power), their forms are unseen.\n**Xiàn** (seen), pronounced *xiàn* (as in \"acclaim\").\n**Wáng** says: Spirits and gods take formlessness as **líng** (numinous).\n**Chén** says: The gathering—**Yīn**-**qì** (vital breath) collects.\nAll things decay and decline; form returns to formlessness,\nthings return to their roots.\nWhat is rootless? Is it not **líng** (numinous)?\nThe **jīng qì** (refined vital breath) becomes things,\nwandering spirits as transformations—\nwhen gathered, they become things;\nwhen scattered, they are formless.\nThus, spirits and gods take formlessness as **líng** (numinous).\n\n**Guāng** says: One is the lowest of the low,\nalso the water—\na symbol of profound darkness.\nThe second day: **Yàn cùi xī xī** (Gathered like swallows, joyous and merry).\n**Cè** says: **Yàn cùi xī xī**, indulging in licentious revelry.\n**Fàn**’s original text had *yàn* (transgression), **Xiǎo Sòng** as *yàn* (transgression),\nnow following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.\nTwo is the midpoint of thought, the common folk#26;\nfacing the night.\nGathering in darkness and reveling in excess,\noverindulgence leads to transgression.\n\nThe third day: **Zōng qí gāo nián** (Revering the high years), the gate of spirits.\n**Cè** says: Revering the high years—\nspirits await respect.\n**Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original texts all read *Zōng qí gāo xīn* (Revering the high virtue),\nnow following **Fàn**’s original text.\n**Fàn** says: Three is the gate.\n\nThe fourth day: Dragging a sheep to offer at the **cóng shè** (shrine groves),\nholding the **guī** (jewel-axe) to reverence its left thigh—**yě** (wild).\n**Cè** says: Dragging a sheep at the grove,\ninsufficient for honor.\n**Fàn**’s original text had *xìn bì qí zuǒ gǔ* (reverence and ward off its left thigh),\n**Cè** says: Insufficient for labor,\nnow following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.\n**Xìn** (reverence), same as *shēn* (to extend).\nThe sheep is the **zhōng shèng** (central sacrificial victim).\nShrines follow groves and forests—\nthe lesser spirits.\nHolding the **guī** (jewel-axe), a solemn rite.\nThe reverence should extend the right thigh.\nFour is the night of the day,\nthough there be blessings and riches,\nthey cannot be utilized—\nlike dragging a sheep to merely display at the shrine groves,\ninsufficient for honor.\nHolding the **guī** (jewel-axe) and bowing,\nit extends the left thigh,\nthus failing to escape vulgarity.\n\nThe fifth day: **Dǐng xuè zhī yòu** (The tainted blood of the cauldron),\n**jiǔ zōng zhī hào** (the delight of nine clans),\nthus the later has trust.\n**Cè** says: The tainted blood of the cauldron,\ntrusting the **Wáng**’s (King’s) command.\n**Wáng** says: **Yòu**, same as *yòu* (to blaze),\nmeaning the sacrificial firewood.\n\nThe sixth day: **Wèi qí guǐ** (Fearful of its spirits),\n**zūn qí lǐ** (honoring its rites),\n**kuáng zuò mí yín** (madness as licentiousness),\n**wáng** (perishing).\n**Cè** says: The madness of fearing spirits,\nexceeding the proper measure.\n**Fàn**’s original text had *mèi* (to obscure);\nnow following **Sòng**, **Lù**, and **Wáng**’s original text.\n\nThe **King** says: *Mí* (眯) means the eyes see nothing#28.\nMadness and blindness while seeking licentious rites—then it is in darkness.\n\nThe seventh: **Sǒng cuì at the mound and tomb.**\n**Cè** says: **Sǒng cuì** at mound and tomb—rites are not abandoned.\nThe **King** says: **Sǒng** means reverence.\n**Guāng** says: Seven is high, is rites, and marks the beginning of calamity, yet it is daytime.\nWith reverence gathered at mound and tomb, it is the symbol of burial rites.\n\nThe eighth: **The screech-owl in the forest, trampling the many birds.**\n**Cè** says: The screech-owl in the forest—what all gather upon.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lù** texts read *guā* (呱), the **Wáng** text reads *fèi* (吠);

now following the other texts.\n*Cáng* is pronounced *cú* (徂浪切).\nFive occupies an exalted position, receiving great fortune, yet does not practice virtue and charity, but accumulates without end—just enough to profit the thief.\nThe **Qín** accumulated the **Ào Cāng** for the resources of **Chǔ-Hàn**; the **Sūi** accumulated at **Luòkǒu** for **Lǐ Mì’s** use—all are of this kind.\n\nThe sixth: **Great fullness and generous bestowal—obtaining people without arrogance.**\n**Cè** says: Great fullness and generous bestowal—people come to it.\nThe **Wáng** text reads *fāng* (方) for *kàng* (亢); now following the other texts.\n*Shī* (施) is pronounced *shì* (式豉切).\nThe **King** says: Six occupies a position of prosperity, obtaining the time of day.\nThe accumulation is greatly full, yet able to bestow greatly, aiding all things.\nThus, people all turn to it—its way is boundless.\n**Guāng** says: Wealth dispersed gathers people—thus it obtains them.\n*Kàng* means rival.\nThe *Shī* says: *\"None rival, only the people.\"* Thus, it is without rival in the world.\n\nThe seventh: **Protruding and prominent, jade and silk arrayed—deciding to invite bandits.**\n**Cè** says: Protruding and prominent—this is the thief’s invitation.\nThe **Fàn** text reads *shōu* (收) for *zhāo* (招);

The *Wáng* text renders *miáo* (苗) as *wáng* (亡), while the *Xiǎo Sòng* text renders it as *dí* (笛), pronounced like *dí* (迪). Now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* texts.\n*Miáo* (苗), anciently written as *wěi* (委), signifies deferred consequences.\n\nFàn says: In cases where evil is great, calamity will extend even to the descendants.\nGuāng says: When wrong is accumulated to its extreme, calamity reaches its full measure—deferred and deferred, it thus drags on to affect the descendants. #31\n\n**Three regions, one state; three departments, one family adorned.**\nThe *Yáng* family’s fire—corresponding to *Bēn* (贲).\nUpon entering adornment, the eighth hexagram, **thirty-six degrees with fifteen seconds**, the *Qiūfèn* (秋分) *qi* aligns, hence it also corresponds to *Duì* (兑).\n*Duì* signifies speech and tongue, thus adornment displays the symbols of excessive words.\n\nThe *Yáng* (阳) adorned in white, the *Yīn* (阴) in black—each fulfills its role, and adornment marks their entering and exiting.\nThe *Sòng*, *Lù*, and *Fàn* texts render *jué* (厥) as *qí* (其). Now following the *Sòng* and *Lù* texts.\n*Sòng* says: When *Yīn* *qi* emerges, it governs above, hence white is used for adornment.\nWhen *Yáng* *qi* enters, it governs below, hence black is used for adornment.\n*Lù* says: *Yīn* governs the west, hence white; *Yáng* retreats to the north, hence black.\n*Wáng* says: White signifies manifestation, black signifies concealment.\nWhite and black divide in form—their adornment is thus revealed.\n\nThe first: **Speech without words—words without speech.**\n**Cè** says: Speech without words—silent yet trustworthy.\nThe *Wáng* text omits *zàncí* (赞辞) and reads only *yán bù yǐ yán* (言不以言). Now following the other texts.\nOne signifies the beginning of thought, and it is daytime.\nThe virtuous man inwardly upholds his utmost sincerity, submerged in profound silence, regarding speechlessness as true speech.\nThis is so because silent trustworthiness is the essence of speech.\nConfucius said: What does Heaven speak?\nThe four seasons proceed in their course, and all things are born.\n\nThe second: **Adornment without substance—first the fine words, then the loss of proper conduct.**\n**Cè** says: Adornment without substance, first the fine words—this is the loss of sincerity.\nThe *Wáng* text renders *zhēn* (贞) as *zhēn* (真). Now following the other texts.\n*Wáng* says: Without its foundation, seeking adornment, though it may begin with elegant words, it will ultimately lose its proper conduct.\nGuāng says: Two signifies the midpoint of thought, yet it is night.\nThe petty man lacks inner sincerity, merely indulging in outward adornment.\nAt first, his words and appearance may seem trustworthy and beautiful, but in the end, he loses his true conduct.\nConduct refers to the manifestation of virtue in outward form.\n\nThe third: **He spits forth a yellow tongue, grasps a yellow brush—advantageous to see the wise.**\n**Cè** says: The advantage of a sharp tongue and brush—this is the advantage of discerning people.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *tǔ huáng shé* (吐黄舌) as *tǔ huáng qiú shé* (吐黄酋舌), and the *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* texts render *qián* (钳) as *gān* (柑). Now following the *Wáng* text.\n*Qián* (钳) is pronounced *jūlián* (渠廉).\n*Zhī* (知) is used interchangeably with *zhì* (智).\n*Qián* (钳) means to hold.\n*Yù* (聿) means brush.\nThe virtuous man speaks and writes, never straying from the central path—only the wise can understand this, while the foolish are unworthy of discussion.\n*The Fǎyán* (法言) says: Speech is the voice of the heart.\nWriting is the drawing of the heart.\nVoice and drawing reveal form—the virtuous and the petty are thus distinguished.\n\nThe fourth: **A sharp tongue, blustering and clamorous—this is the proper conduct of the merchant.**\n**Cè** says: The proper conduct of blustering and clamorous speech—this is advantageous to the merchant.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *lì shé wāwā* (利舌哇哇) as *shé wāwā* (舌哇哇), while the *Fàn* and *Xiǎo Sòng* texts render it as *lì kǒu wāwā* (利口哇哇). Now following the *Wáng* text.\n*Wā* (哇) is pronounced *wūjiā* (乌佳).\n*Wáng* says: Merely adorning words with empty rhetoric to dazzle and sell—this is the proper conduct of the merchant, not the virtuous man’s true path.\n\n---\n\n**The Fifth:** Speech humbles like water, yet its essence is the **Heavenly Vagina** (天牝).\n**Cè** says: Humble speech like water—it can wash away impurities.\nNow following the **Wáng** text, where *tàn* (牝) is rendered as *bǐ* (比).\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* text states: Though firm in principle, one can empty the heart to receive sound counsel, heeding advice like flowing water—what would not be embraced?\n**Guāng** says: *Tàn* (牝) means \"valley.\" The **Heavenly Vagina** refers to the **sea**.\nFive holds the exalted position yet aligns with daytime, humbling itself to accept others' words.\nThus, people vie to tell it of the **Dao** (善道), like water flowing into the sea.\nThe sea, though low, receives all streams, and so achieves its vastness;\nThe **virtuous ruler** (君), though humble, gathers all goodness, and so achieves his **sainthood** (圣).\n\n**The Sixth:** Speech has no retraction—it soars like the wind, the **Great Person** (大人) a thunderous gust.\n**Cè** says: Speech that cannot be retracted—this is also to exalt it.\nThe **Great Person** refers to one in a noble position.\nSix passes the midpoint yet aligns with night, marking one who errs in speech.\nA single misspoken word cannot be undone by four horses’ tongues—hence, \"speech has no retraction.\"\nThough one cleanses it, the more foul it becomes—this is the **mouth** (口) #32.\nEven if one tries to suppress it, it has already soared—hence, \"it soars like the wind.\"\nMoreover, power and blessings lie within oneself—when words issue forth, swift as wind and thunder, they bring life or ruin to all things.\nHow can one not be cautious?\n\n**The Seventh:** When the time for speech is not ripe, words are faint, and the **superior** (上) grows suspicious.\n**Cè** says: If the time for speech is not ripe, how can it be clear?\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* text omits the *bù* (不) character; now following the other families.\n*Jiàn* (见) is pronounced *xián biàn* (贤遍).\n**Fàn** says: *Dīng* (丁) means \"proper\" or \"due.\"\nA faint wind is all that can be done—it cannot be clear and evident.\n**Guāng** says: Seven marks the beginning of calamity, yet aligns with daytime.\nThe **virtuous man** (君子) serving under a **tyrannical ruler** (暴君) cannot speak directly, so he uses faint words, a gentle wind.\nIf he speaks clearly, the ruler will surely doubt him.\nConfucius said: The **virtuous man** (君子) must first be trusted before offering counsel.\nIf he is not trusted, his words will be taken as slander against himself.\n\n**The Eighth:** Murmuring like cicadas, ceaselessly, blood flows from the mouth.\n**Cè** says: Murmuring like cicadas—this is self-inflicted harm.\n*Chuì* (蛁) is the same as *tiáo* (蜩).\n*Yōng* (喁) is pronounced *yǒng* (颙).\n**Wáng** says: *Tiáo* (蜩) is the insect that chirps incessantly.\n**Guāng** says: *Yōng yōng* (喁喁) is like *zhūn zhūn* (谆谆).\nEight marks the midpoint of calamity, yet aligns with night.\nWhen the ruler does not accept counsel, the minister forcefully presses his words, risking either humiliation or punishment.\nLike the cicada’s ceaseless chirping, though blood flows from the mouth, who would listen?\nIt only harms oneself.\n\n**The Ninth (Upper):** A **white tongue** (白舌) speaks *yú yú* (于于), bent at its root, the **virtuous man** (君子) loses faith.\n**Cè** says: A **white tongue** speaking *yú yú*—this is truly a lasting way.\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render **Cè**’s words as: \"A **white tongue** (信舌不白).\"\n**Wáng** renders *yú yú* (于于) as *gān gān* (干干), and **Cè** says: \"This marks speech that is not trusted.\"\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* text reads: \"A **white tongue** (白舌不白), bent at its root.\"\nNow following the **Fàn** text.\n*Fǒu* (否) means \"contradict,\" pronounced *fāng jiǔ* (方九).\n*Yú yú* (于于) describes a **bent** or **submissive** posture.\nNine marks the extreme of calamity, yet aligns with daytime.\nThe **virtuous man** (君子) in an age of **non-Dao** (无道), when his words are not believed, should only bend his tongue and keep silent.\nThis is truly a lasting way.\nThe *Yì* (易) says: \"If words are not trusted, even the mouth will be exhausted.\"\nThree families, one state, three departments, and two households have doubts.\nWood and **accommodation** (贲) are also aligned.\nThis doubt is like the **wind** (巽) or **thunder** (震)—the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** texts all take it as the **wind** (巽), while **Fàn** takes it as **thunder** (震).\nBoth are incorrect.\nWhen **yin** and **yang** clash, all things are injured and scattered—this is doubt.\n*Dǐng* (硙) is pronounced *wǔ duì* (午对).\n**Sòng** says: When things clash and are scattered, it is called *dǐng*.\nAt this time, **yin** and **yang** clash, their proportions balanced, and day and night equal.\n**Lù** says: *Diāo* (雕) means \"injured,\" and *lí* (离) means \"scattered.\"\nWhen **yin** is low yet dominant, and **yang** is exalted yet neglected, this is doubt—this is injury and scattering.\n\n**The First:** Doubt is restless—**virtue/power** (德) and **truth** (贞) are lost.\n**Cè** says: Doubt that is not upright—how can it be settled?\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* text renders *huí* (徊) and *chuàng* (恛) as *jǔ* (呬), with the pronunciation *xū lì* (虚利).\n*Jǔ jǔ* (呬呬) means \"laugh.\"\nNow following the other families.\n**Fàn** renders *bù zhèng zhī yí* (不正之疑) as *yí kǎi* (疑怬失贞).\nNow following the other families.\n*Chuàng* (恛) is pronounced *huí* (回).\n**Fàn** says: *Shǐ* (矢) means \"straight.\"\n**Wáng** says: *Chuàng chuàng* (恛恛) describes a **confused** and **chaotic** state.\n**Guāng** says: One marks the beginning of thought, yet aligns with night.\nThe **petty man** (小人) has no upright heart, filled with doubt yet hesitant to decide, ultimately settling on nothing.\n\n**The Second:** Doubt turns inward—**trust** (孚) is near.\n**Cè** says: Doubt turns inward—this is turning from **clarity and tranquility** (清静).\nTwo marks the midpoint of thought, a **repetition** (反复), yet aligns with daytime.\nThe **virtuous man** (君子) with doubt should screen out desires and interests, balance away love and hatred, quiet his heart, and reflect upon himself.\nIf it is **righteousness** (义), he will act; if not, he will abandon it.\nWith this to resolve doubt, how far can it be?\n\n**The Third:** Doubt is forcefully illuminated—**receptive compassion** (慈闵) is met, yet it troubles the heart’s root.\n**Cè** says: Doubt is forcefully illuminated—this is **darkness** (冥) within the heart.\n**Fàn** renders *qiáng* (强) as *qiǎng* (强), now following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** texts.\n*Qiáng* (强) is pronounced *qí liǎng* (其两).\n**Wáng** says: Though in doubt, one forcefully illuminates—this is **darkness** (暗) yet **forceful clarity** (强明).\nIt is fitting that such **receptive compassion** (慈闵) troubles the heart’s **root** (祖).\n**Guāng** says: Three marks the completion of thought, yet aligns with night, hence this symbol.\nConfucius said: \"To know is to know; to not know is to not know—this is wisdom.\"\nThe *Qǔ Lǐ* (曲礼) says: \"In doubtful matters, do not **question** (质).\"\n**Cè** says: Doubt is considered—this is **consulting the past** (旧) first.\n\n---\n\n**Wáng** says: When the heart holds doubts, yet examines and verifies the ancient texts to clarify them, then doubts will surely be resolved.\n\n**Guāng** says: Four is the **\"external\"** (外它), the **\"clear and flowing\"** (条畅), yet aligns with day, hence this symbol.\n\nAncient texts and old persons alike may be consulted.\nWhen one consults and encounters true sincerity and trustworthiness, then it is fitting to follow them.\n\nConfucius said: **\"Doubt, ponder, and inquire.\"**\n\nNext, **Five**: **Hūn** (赨) and **Huáng** (黄), doubting the **center of *Jīn*** (金中).\n**Cè** says: *Hūn* (赨) and *Huáng* (黄) in doubt—this is **perversion seizing the upright** (邪夺正).\n\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* texts render *hūn* (赨) as *xià* (吓), which does not appear in the character dictionaries;\n**Fàn** renders it as *fáng* (妨); now following the **Wáng** and **Chén** texts.\n*Hūn*, pronounced *tú dōng* (徒冬).\n\n**Fàn** says: *Hūn* is the **crimson** (赤).\n**Wáng** says: *Hūn* is the **vermilion** (彤), same as *tóng* (彤).\n\nThough in a position of prestige, yet dwelling in darkness and aligning with night,\none cannot discern and resolve the doubts.\nThe vermilion and yellow hues, yet doubting them for *Jīn* (金).\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* (小宋) says: *Hūn* (赨), pronounced *xióng* (雄), is the **雄黄** (*xiónghuáng*, orpiment).\nThe *hūn* (赨) and *huáng* (黄) hues are radiant and resplendent—\none doubts there might be traces of *Jīn* (金) within them.\n\n**Guāng** says: Five occupies the **honored position** (尊位), yet aligns with night.\nIn doubt yet unable to clarify, the **greatly deceptive** (大佞) resembles loyalty—\nthus perversion can seize the upright.\n\nNext, **Six**: **Oaths of sincerity** (誓贞) may be heeded, yet doubts may still hold **truth** (诚).\n**Cè** says: *Oaths of sincerity* (誓贞) may be heeded—this clarifies the **Sovereign’s command** (王命).\n\n**Wáng** says: Six attains its position and aligns with day,\nable to resolve all doubts.\nWith **proclamations and oaths** (诰誓) to set things right,\nall may heed and discern what confounds them.\nEven if doubts persist and understanding has not yet dawned,\nthere is the **Way of sincere clarity** (诚明之道) to penetrate them—\nthen all **foolishness and confusion** (愚迷) will be dispelled.\nThis is the **reiteration of the Sovereign’s command** (申明王命)\nto **cut through the masses’ doubts** (断众疑).\n\n**Guāng** says: All things bear **doubts** (疑),\nhence one must **swear oaths** (誓) to them.\nWhen oaths are **upright** (正), then all may heed them.\nYet if people still **doubt** (疑) the oaths,\nthen one must **reiterate them with utmost sincerity** (申之以至诚).\n**Sincerity** (诚) makes them follow;\n**lack of sincerity** (不诚) makes them not follow.\n\n「Six is the uppermost fortune (上禄), hence it is called **Sovereign’s Command** (王命).\n\nNext, **Seven**: Ghostly apparitions (鬼魂) harbor doubts (疑), sighing and wailing (嚘鸣).\nCatching birds of the **proclaimed wood** (弋木之鸟) or foxes from the **marked holes** (射穴之狐),\ninverts the senses—**eyes see as ears** (反目耳), and **ears hear as eyes** (厉).\n**Guāng** says: Ghostly apparitions (鬼魂) are vague (恍惚), flickering between presence and absence (若有若无), truly deserving of doubt (疑).\n**Black not as crow** (莫黑匪乌), **red not as fox** (莫赤匪狐)—these are distinctions easily made.\n**Eyes see, ears hear** (目视耳听) is the natural order of things.\nSeven signifies **losing one’s resolve** (失志), **decay** (消), **ruin and harm** (败损), and occurs at night.\nSince one’s own **illumination is obscured** (己既不明), many are **bewildered** (惑).\nWhether they be **ghosts or spirits** (若鬼若魂), unable to discern, one can only sigh in lament (叹嗟而已).\nThough crows and foxes are easily distinguished, still there may be **mistakes or omissions** (或得失), leaving doubt unresolved.\nIf one’s own **ears and eyes** (己之耳目) are not even trusted,\nthen to **see with ears and hear with eyes** (反以耳视而目听) is truly perilous (宜其危矣).\n\nNext, **Eight**: **Inverted doubts** (颠疑) meet with **obstructive guests** (遇干客), three years without hunting.\n**Guāng** says: When **inverted doubts** (颠疑) encounter guests (客), it is an occasion of utmost reverence (甚足敬也).\n**Hunting** (射) is pronounced *yì*.\n**Fàn** says: **Hunting** (射) here means **satiation** (厌).\n\nAt the **uppermost Nine**, **doubt without trust** (疑无信) leads to **drawing the bow like a deer** (控弧拟麋), resulting in **nothingness** (无).\n**Guāng** says: **Doubt without trust** (疑无信), when carried to its extreme (终), yields no **fate or name** (所名).\nThe **Sòng, Lǔ, Fàn, Wáng** commentaries all originally read *九疑无信*, now following the **Wáng and small Sòng** versions.\n**Fàn** says: **Without trust** (无信) means **nothing worthy of trust** (无所信).\n**Drawing the bow like a deer** (控弧拟麋) and **nothingness** (无) further emphasize the **depth of doubt** (疑之甚).\n\n**Guāng** says: Nine represents **doubt at its peak** (疑极), hence this **symbol** (象).\nIf doubt persists without resolution (终疑不决), then **no fate or name** (成名) will be attained.\n\n**Three directions, one state, three departments, three families observe** (三方一州三部三家视):\nThe **Yáng family** (阳家) sees **gold** (金), following the **observations of the *Zhuan* texts** (准观).\nThe **Yīn family** (阴成) sees **the forming of vital essence** (魄), the **Yáng family** (阳成) sees **the forming of ancestral spirits** (妣),\nand all **manifestations of things** (物之形貌) are visible.\n\n**Wáng** says: At this time, the **forms of all things are fully manifest** (万物形貌已成), all visible.\n**Guāng** says: The **Yīn of autumn equinox** (秋分之阴) is like the **moon taking shape** (月成魄).\n**Mǐ** (妣) should be read as **配** (match), with the pronunciation *pǐ-jì* (匹计切).\nAt the **midpoint of Yīn and Yáng** (阴阳中分), **pairing is complete** (成配偶).\n\n**First day (初一)**, **concealing one’s illumination** (内其明), not using its **radiance** (光).\n**Guāng** says: **Concealing one’s illumination** (内其明) means **self-examination in darkness** (自窥深).\n**Fàn** says: **Inner reflection without remorse** (内省不疚), then what **worries or fears** (忧惧) can there be?\n\n**Guāng** says: One (一) marks the **beginning of contemplation** (思始), occurring at **day’s dawn** (当昼).\n**Retreating vision inward** (收视内明), not relying on **external radiance** (外光).\n\nNext, **Second day (次二)**, **the noble sees within** (君子视内), **the petty sees without** (小人视外).\n**Guāng** says: The petty **seeing outward** (视外) cannot **perceive the heart** (见心).\n**Body’s flourishing or decline** (身之荣悴), **people’s virtue or lack thereof** (人之贤不肖)—none escape this truth.\n\nNext, **Third day (次三)**, **observing virtue** (视其德) can **support the Sovereign’s realm** (可以干王之国).\n**Guāng** says: **Observing virtue** (视德) to **uphold the state** (干), ensures **completeness and integrity** (乃能有全).\nThree (三) signifies **intent fully formed** (成意), and also **advancing others** (进人), occurring at **midday** (当日之昼),\nwhen **virtue is manifest and externalized** (德成而外形).\nHence, the **Sovereign observes virtue’s scale** (王者视德之大小),\nassigning **rank and position** (任以爵位) to serve as **the pillars of the state** (为国家之桢干).\n\nNext, **Fourth day (次四)**, **powdering the forehead** (粉其题), **moistening the mustache** (雨其渥须),\n**the vision is without charm** (视无姝).\n**Guāng** says: **Powdering the forehead and moistening the mustache** (粉题雨须) is **unbearable to behold** (不可忍瞻).\nThe **Sòng and Lǔ** versions lack the word *忍*, the **small Sòng** version lacks *可*,\nnow following the **Fàn and Wáng** versions.\n\n**Wáng**’s version reads *顺* (顺), meaning **facial expression altered** (面权).\nThe **small Sòng** version reads *面无色* (面无色), pronounced *mì-jué* (匹迥切), meaning **face without hue** (面无色).\nNow following **Fàn**’s version.\n**题** (题), pronounced *fěn-biàn* (粉变切), means **forehead** (额).\n**面** (面), pronounced *mì* (匹), means **face** (面).\n**姝** (姝), pronounced *chūn-jū* (春朱切), means **beautiful** (好).\n**Fàn** says: **题** (题) is the **forehead** (额).\n**面** (面) is the **face** (面).\n**姝** (姝) means **beauty or grace** (好).\n\n「Guāng says: The fourth **color (sè)** is **white (bái)**, which signifies **low rank and fortune (xià lù)**, **external but not intrinsic (wài tāi)**, and is the adornment of **petty people (xiǎo rén)** who embellish their outward appearance to gain fortune. **Prolonged pretense must fail (wěi jiǔ bì bài)**, just as **powdering the forehead (fěn tí)** and encountering rain causes the **mustache to cling with dampness (wū xū)**,—how could others find it pleasing (hǎo) when they see it?\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** is **luan-fèng (鸾凤) in riotous display (fēn rú)**, and its **virtue/power (dé)** shines **brilliantly (huī rú)**. **Guāng says:** *Luan-fèng in riotous display (鸾凤纷如)* means **virtue/power radiant and pure (dé guāng hào)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *huī (晖)* as *shí (时)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**.\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** occupies the **highest rank (zūn wèi)**, receives **great blessings (shèng fú)**, yet is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)**. When the **Sovereign’s virtue/power shines (zhōng dé huī rú)** and **auspicious omens (jiā ruì)** gather, then the *luan-fèng* appear in abundance. **Jiā Yì (贾谊)** says: *The phoenix soars at a thousand rèn (仞), gazing upon the radiant virtue/power and descending (览德晖而下之).*\n\nThe sixth **color (sè)** is **white chariot with emerald canopy (sù chē cuì gài)**, which is **harmful to vision (wéi shì zhī hài)**, yet **pure (zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *White chariot with emerald canopy (素车翠盖)* is merely **loveliness of outward appearance (tú hǎo wài)**. The sixth **color (sè)** signifies **high fortune (shàng lù)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** without virtue/power (dé) yet holding fortune (lù) are **lovely without but ugly within (wài hǎo nèi chǒu)**, like riding a **white chariot (sù chē)** while displaying an **emerald canopy (cuì gài)**—their outward appearance seems splendid, but inwardly they lack refinement. **The pure (zhēn)** must be **judged with upright vision (dāng yǐ zhèng shì)**, then their **beauty and ugliness will be self-evident (zhī hǎo chǒu fēn fēn)**.\n\nThe seventh **color (sè)** is **to observe its flaws (shì qí xiá)**, yet **without impurity (wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *To observe its flaws (视其瑕)* means **one can correct oneself (néng zì jiāo)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *wú (无)* as *wǎng (罔)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: The seventh **color (sè)** occupies a **position of excess (guò mǎn zhī dì)**, yet one still holds rank at **day (dāng zhòu)**—this is the ability to **examine one’s flaws in accordance with the times (yīn shí ér zì shì qí xiá)**, to **guard against faults before they arise (jiè yú wèi méng)**, so that **blame and regret do not take root (guā zǔi bù shēng)**, and thus **impurity never appears (gù wéi wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *This is why the seventh **color (sè)** is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)***—it marks the **beginning of calamity (huò shǐ)**.\n\nThe eighth **color (sè)** is **feicui (翡翠) in flight (yú fēi)**, **detaching its wings (lí qí yì)**; the **fur of the fox (hú máo)** becomes **one’s own undoing (gōng qí zéi)**. **Guāng says:** *Feicui and fox fur (翡翠狐鼠)* are **loveliness in form (hǎo zuò)**, yet **a cause for blame (jiù)**. **Má (鼦)**, pronounced *dū liáo (都聊)切*, is the same as *diāo (貂)*. **Fàn (范)** says: **Each uses its patterned fur (wén máo)**, yet **both bring about disaster (shì shēn zhī huò)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Wǎng (罔) detaches its wings (lí qí yì)*. **Guāng says:** *The eighth **color (sè)** is the **midpoint of calamity (huò zhōng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **External beauty (wài guān zhī měi)** becomes **a personal misfortune (shì shēn zhī zāi)**. **Mèngzǐ (孟子)** says: *A man like Běnchéng (盆成) may have some talent (xiǎo yǒu cái)*, yet **if he has not heard the Great Dao/Way of the Noble (dà dào)**, then **it is enough to ruin his life (bì zhì shēn ér wéi yǐ)**.\n\nThe ninth **color (sè)** is **the sun setting its light (rì méi qí guāng)**, **glowing in the east (bīn yú dōng fāng)**, **observing its origins (yòng shì qí shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *The sun setting and glowing in the east (rì yù bīn dōng)*, **finally turning back to its beginning (zhōng gù shǐ)**#38. **Fàn (范)** says: *Bīn (贲)* means **yellow-white hue (huáng-bái sè)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *The sun as it sets glows in the east (rì zhī jiāng méi bīn dōng fāng)*. **Guāng says:** *The ninth **color (sè)** is the **end of vision (shì zhī zhōng)**, yet it appears at **day (dāng zhòu)**. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** cultivates **virtue/power (dé)** and establishes **achievements (lèng gōng)**, **treating the end as the beginning (shèn zhōng rú shǐ)**. As the sun sets, it **reflects back upon the east (fǎn zhào dōng fāng)**. **The *Yì* (易) says:** *To observe one’s steps (shì lǚ)*, **to examine omens (kǎo xiáng)**, **and to return to their roots (qí xuán yuán jí)** is **ultimately auspicious (shǐ zhuān yuán jí)**. **The three regions, two states, one department, and one family (sān fāng èr zhōu yī bù yī jiā)** are submerged in **yin (yīn)**, **water (shuǐ)**, and **observation (guān)** is also appropriate here.\n\nThe fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the sun abandoning its family (rì shě shì)**. **Yīn (沈)** means **to descend or sink (xià shì)**. The **other versions (jū jiā)** assume this to be **yīn duì (沈兑)**, but this is incorrect. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** proceed separately, yet **both yearn for the other (xiāng sī)**. Their **intentions lie in the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**. **Sòng (宋)** says: *Xiāng (怀)* means **to ponder (sī)**. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** have long been distinct, yet **they both converge in autumn (qiū zhōng)**, **mutually yearning (xiāng sī)**, so their **intentions are both fixed upon the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**.\n\nThe first **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **not hearing the pure (bù wén zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (沈耳于闺)* means **losing the essence of virtue/power (shī dé tǐ)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The first **color (sè)** is the **ear (ěr)**, **which is submerged in water (shuǐ zhōng)**, hence **sinking (yīn)***. **Guāng says:** *The first **color (sè)** is the **lowest of low (xià xià)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** delight in **sinking their ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **listening secretly (qián tīng)**, **to uncover others’ hidden affairs (yǐ xià rén zhī yǐn sī)**, yet **they do not hear the Noble’s upright Dao/Way (zhēn dào)**. **Even if they fill their ears with tassels (chuí liáng chōng ěr)**, **they still cannot perceive hidden truths (wù wú yǐn qíng)**.\n\nThe second **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **sinking vision to self-perception (yīn shì zì jiàn)**, **superior to the one-eyed’s glance (xiàn yú miǎo zhī miǎn)**. **Guāng says:** *Sinking vision’s perception (沈视之见)* attains **true beauty (dé zhèng měi)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The second **color (sè)** is the **eye (mù)**, yet **it belongs to the sinking family (yīn jiā)**, hence **sinking vision (yīn shì)***. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Miǎo (眇)*; **one-eyed and blind (yī mù máng)**. **Miǎn (眄)** is **oblique vision (yé shì)**. **Guāng says:** *The second **color (sè)** is **mid-thought (sī zhōng)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **Sinking vision (yīn shì)** within oneself **perceives both good and evil (zì jiàn shàn è)**, **attaining its true beauty (dé qí zhèng měi)**. It is **superior to petty people (xiàn yú xiǎo rén)**, who **cannot inwardly reflect (bù néng nèi xǐng)** yet **spy on others’ right and wrong (páng kuī tā rén zhī shì fēi)**. Like **the one-eyed (miǎo mù)**, **they themselves are unclear (jǐ zé bù míng)**, yet **they delight in oblique vision (hǎo yé shì)**.\n\nThe third **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink in beauty (yīn yú měi)**, **losing the true arrow (shī zhēn shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink in beauty (沈于美)* means **acting like the deaf and blind (zuò lóng máng)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *Shǐ (矢)* means **straightforwardness (zhí)**. **Guāng says:** *The third **color (sè)** is **upper thought (sī shàng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** **are drowned in the beauty of sounds and colors (yīn yì shēng sè zhī měi)**, **losing their upright nature (shī qí zhèng zhí zhī xìng)**. **Lǎozǐ (老子)** says: *The five tones (yīn) make one’s ears deaf (ér lóng), the five colors (sè) make one’s eyes blind (mù máng)*. This means **what one hears and sees is not truly perceived (suǒ wén jiàn jiē bù dé qí zhèng)**, **like the deaf and blind (rú lóng máng)**.\n\nThe fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. Like the **phoenix chick (fèng xià)**, **it does not feed unless it finds the right place (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, then **it gathers (rán jié yǐ)**. **The fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. As the **phoenix chick (fèng chú)**, **it gazes downward at the four lands (xiàng dī yú sì fāng)**, **and only feeds on bamboo and grain (fèi zhú shí)**, **selecting the place where it can feed (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, **then gathering (rán jié yǐ)**.\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (gāo xiáng)**, **sinking its belly (yīn qí fù)**, **delighting in foul gruel (hǎo è jiù)**. **Guāng says:** *The carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (高翔)* is **found in rotten grain (zài fǔ liáng)**. The **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions read *jiù (粥)* as *shéng (绳)*, but now following the **Fàn (范)** and **Wáng (王)** versions. **Wú (吴)** says: *Jiù (粥)* is an ancient form of *yù (育)*. **Guāng says:** *The *Guānzǐ (管子)* says: *A woman does not abandon her husband (fù)*#42. **Jiù (粥)** shares the same **heart (xīn)** as *yù (育)*, with **good and evil (hǎo è)** read as the character itself. The fifth **color (sè)** holds **eminent rank (zūn wèi)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **It looks upward yet its aspirations are low (wàng gāo ér zhì q\n\nAs the carved eagle and fierce crow,\nthough its flight soars high,\nit gazes downward at the rotting rat—\nits intent fixed on seizing it\nto fill its belly.\nAt first it seems virtuous,\nyet ends in depravity—\nthus it delights in *yù* (孕) yet spurns *yù* (育).\n\nNext, the sixth:\nGrain seen as piled treasure,\nbeneficial when rightly bestowed upon the king.\n**Guāng says:** Grain piled high—\nits Dao is manifest.\nThe **Fàn (范)** and **Wáng (王)** versions read *sù (粟)* as *piào (票)*;\nnow following the **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions.\nThe **Fàn (范)** version reads *lěi (累)* as *lěi (累)*;\nnow following the other editions.\n\nNext, the seventh:\n**Lí** like **Lóu** (离娄),\nwith crimson flesh and owl-like wings.\n**Lì** says: **Lí** and **Lóu** with crimson flesh—\ntheir food is unwholesome.\nThe seventh hexagram:\nRed in use, resembling feathers.\nAgain, the seventh signifies lost resolve,\nand occurs at night.\nThough vision is as keen as **Lí** and **Lóu**,\nseeing crimson flesh and taking it,\none gains only the foul bird.\nTo eat without choosing one’s fortune—\nthis is the path of peril.\n\nNext, the eighth:\n**Pàn** obtains its medicine,\nbeneficial for auspicious movement.\n**Guāng says:** **Pàn** obtains its medicine—\nauspicious for advancing.\nThe **Fàn (范)** and **Xiǎo Sòng (小宋)** versions read *lì zhēng (利征)* as *zhēng lì (征利)*;\nnow following the **Sòng (宋)**, **Lǔ (陆)**, and **Wáng (王)** versions.\nThe eighth hexagram is at the midpoint of calamity,\nyet occurs in daylight—\nthus it obtains medicine and auspicious movement.\n\nAt the top, the ninth:\nBlood like **Gāng (刚)**,\nsinking into the brow—\nbefore death, then mourning.\n**Guāng says:** Blood like **Gāng (刚)**, sinking into the brow—\nit ends in ruin through greed.\nThe **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions read *xuè rú gāng (血如刚)*, *shěn yú méng (沈于颡)* as *rú xuè rú gāng (如血如刚)*, *shěn yú zhī méng (沈于之颡)*;\nthe **Wáng (王)** version reads *rú xuè rú gāng (如血如冈)*, *shěn yú zhī méng (沈于之颡)*;\nthe **Xiǎo

succession—\nthus before death, then mourning.\n**Guāng** says: Blood—\nlike fat and moisture.\n**Gāng (刚)** should be read as **Gāng (冈)**.\n*Sinking*—\nit bears the symbol of fishing profit.\nThe ninth hexagram is the extreme of calamity,\nthe exhaustion of resources,\nthe brow.\nFishing profits without end,\ndraining the people’s fat and moisture,\npiling up like hills and ridges,\nuntil it sinks into the brow, unaware—\nthus peril and annihilation follow in turn.\n\nThree regions, two states, one department, two families within—\n**Yáng** family, **Huǒ** (Fire),\n**Zhǔn** returns to **Méi** (darkness).\n\n「Upon entering the inner [region], the third [division]—\nthirteen degrees and twenty-two seconds [of celestial longitude],\nthe Sun aligns with **Dà Huǒ** (大火, the Great Fire star).\n\nThe **qi** of **Hán Lù** (寒露, Cold Dew) responds,\nthe **Dòu** (斗, Big Dipper) establishes its **shù** (戍, Station) position,\nand the **lǜ** (律, musical pitch) corresponds to **Wú Shè**

yourself with propriety yet weep\"* (尔仪而悲), *\"the pit beneath my western stair\"* (坎我西阶).\n\n**Cè** says: *\"You conduct yourself with propriety yet weep\"* (尔仪而悲) — this is the **filial sentiment for one’s mother-in-law** (代母情).\n\n**Fàn** says: *\"The pit\"* (坎) means **sorrow** (忧).\nIn the **ceremony of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之道), the **bride ascends the western stair** (妇升西阶).\nThere is the **virtue of substituting for one’s parents** (代亲之义), hence the **weeping** (故悲).\n\n**Wáng** says: *\"Conduct\"* (仪) means **matching** (匹).\n**Xiǎo Sòng** cites *The Rites of Marriage* (**《昏义》**) thus:\n*\"At dawn\"* (厥明), the **father-in-law and mother-in-law** (舅姑) **feast the bride** (共飨妇), **offering the ritual libation of one cup** (以一献之礼奠酬#44).\nThe **father-in-law and mother-in-law descend first from the western stair** (舅姑先降自西阶), the **bride descends from the eastern stair** (妇降自阼阶), **to signify substitution** (以着代).\n\n**Line Four**: *\"Delighting in trifles, delighting in peril\"* (好小好危), *\"losing her coarse robe\"* (丧其缊袍), **dangerous** (厉).\n\n**Cè** says: *\"Delighting in trifles, delighting in peril\"* (好小好危) — this is **unworthy of honor** (不足荣).\n\nThe **Fàn** version reads *yùn* (蕴) instead of *yùn* (缊), the **Wáng** version reads *bǎo* (饱) instead of *páo* (袍); now following the **Sòng** and **Lù** versions.\n\n**Line Five**: *\"The dragon sinks into the mud\"* (龙下于泥), *\"the virtuous person gains advantage by taking a wife\"* (君子利用取媐), *\"meeting the common and the equal\"* (遇庸夷).\n\n**Cè** says: *\"The dragon sinks into the mud\"* (龙下于泥) — **yang descending into yin** (阳下阴).\n\nThe **Wáng** version reads *fū* (肤) instead of *yōng* (庸); now following the other versions.\n*\"Taking\"* (取) is the same as *\"to wed\"* (娶).\n\n**Fàn** says: *\"The dragon\"* (龙) **illustrates yang** (以谕阳).\n**Yang descending into yin** (阳下于阴) is the **meaning of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之义).\n\n**Guāng** says: In the **ceremony of the bride’s reception** (亲迎之礼), the **groom drives the carriage three circuits** (婿御轮三周) — this is **yang descending into yin** (阳下阴).\n**Yōng** (庸) means **obtaining the norm** (得其常).\n**Yí** (夷) means **equality** (等夷).\n\n**Sixth Hexagram:**\n*\"At dusk, the bird flies and tucks its wings inward.\nThough it would fill the palace, its mate is unseen.\"*\n**Cè** says: *\"At dusk, tucking its wings\"*—it cannot restrain itself.\n**Wáng** says: The sixth position is at its peak yet loses its proper place at night, contrary to the principle of dwelling within.\n*\"At dusk, the bird flies\"*—it has no fixed abode.\n*\"Tucks its wings inward\"*—it cannot restrain itself within.\n*\"Though it would fill the palace\"*—its desire is boundless.\n*\"Its mate is unseen\"*—it loses the way of pairing, gaining nothing in the end.\n\n**Seventh Hexagram:**\n*\"On a crumbling wall, weeds sprout.\nA white-haired man takes his young wife—prosperity.\"\n**Cè** says: *\"Weeds on a crumbling wall\"*—things rejoice in finding their kind.\n*(Wáng version reads *xiù* [秀] for *yǒu* [莠]; now following other versions.)*\n*(Fàn, Xiǎo Sòng versions read *wù* [勿] for *wù* [物]; now following Sòng, Lù, and Wáng versions.)*\n**Hù** (皬) is pronounced *hú-jué* [胡觉].\n**Fàn** says: *\"White but impure\"* is called *hù*.\n**Guāng** says: The seventh marks the beginning of calamity, yet occurs in daylight—declining yet reviving.\n*\"Prosperity\"* means *wealth*.\n*\"Things rejoice in finding their kind\"*—creatures delight in their own.\nThe *Yì* says: *\"A withered willow bears grain,\nAn old man takes a young wife—\nNo misfortune remains.\"*\n\n**Eighth Hexagram:**\n*\"Within, he cannot conquer his wife,\nBringing ruin to household and state,\nWading deep waters, unmeasured.\"\n**Cè** says: *\"Cannot conquer his wife\"*—a state’s sin.\n*(Fàn version reads *bùkěcè* [不可测] for *bùcè* [不测]; now following other versions.)*\n**Fàn** says: *\"Conquer\"* means *overcome*.\n**Ninth (Uppermost) Line:**\n*\"Rain descends to earth—\nIt cannot stop, cannot pass.\n**Cè** says: *\"Rain descends to earth\"*—proper moderation of moisture.\n*(Three regions, two states, one department, three families depart—\nThe Yin house’s wood, aligned with *Wúwàng* [无妄]).*\n\n「The Han scholars interpreted *Wúwàng* [无妄] as \"no further expectations,\" so Yángzǐ [扬子] thus criticized their reading.\n\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Meng* [妄] means *reckless action*; *wàng* [望] means *not what one expects*—this takes both meanings together.\n\nWhen *Yin* [阴] departs from its *Yáng* [阳], and *Yáng* departs from its *Yin*, all things flourish and disperse in wild confusion.\n*Tì* [倜] (pronounced *zhāngliú* [张留]) and *chàng* [倡] (pronounced *chāng* [昌]).\nAt this time, *Yin* and *Yáng* are both departing, their roles yet undetermined, and all things are in wild confusion, unsure of their place.\n\n**Wáng** [王] says: *Tì* [倜] is the same as *zhuó* [侜], meaning all things are rampant and scattered.\n\n**First (Lowermost) Line:**\n*\"Depart from this* **Língyuān** [灵渊], *abandon that* **Kūyuán** [枯园].\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Depart from this* **Língyuān** [灵渊]\"—not by the virtue of humility, but by arrogance.\n**Fàn** [范] says: *One* [一] represents *water*, which is lowest in rank, hence *\"Língyuān\"* [灵渊].\nTo depart from the low is to seek the high—this is not the Dao of humility.\n\n**Xiǎo Sòng** [小宋] says: *\"Kūyuán\"* [枯园] is like *\"high above\"* [高上].\n**Guāng** [光] says: *\"Kūyuán\"* [枯园]—when trees wither, it is because the land is high and lacks nourishment.\n\n*One* [一] is the beginning of *thought* [思], occurring at *night* [夜].\nThe common folk, weary of lowliness, think of the high, desiring to depart from this and follow that—this will surely bring calamity.\n\n**Second Line:**\n*\"Depart from that* **Kūyuán** [枯园], *abandon this* **Língyuān** [灵渊].\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Abandon this* **Língyuān** [灵渊]\"—this is the radiance of the humble Dao.\n*Two* [二] represents *thought in the middle*, occurring at *day* [昼].\nThe sage considers those beneath him, hence the radiance of humility.\n\n**Third Line:**\n*\"He raises his steps,\nTo the hall with dew upon them.\"\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Raising his steps with dew\"*—this is reckless action.\n*(Fàn [范], Xiǎo Sòng [小宋] originally read *mengshēng* [妄升]; Wáng [王] read *ānxíng* [安行]; now following Sòng [宋] and Lù [陆] versions.)*\nDew clinging to one’s garments is an omen of misfortune and disgrace.\n*Three* [三] is the fulfillment of *intent*, occurring at *night* [夜].\nThe common folk, seeing high rank, strive toward it,\nUnwittingly stepping into misfortune and disgrace.\n\n**Fourth Line:**\n*\"Depart from son and father,\nDepart from minister and lord.\"\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Depart from son and father\"*—this is not what one expects.\n*(Fàn [范] originally read *qù yú fùzǐ* [去于父子]; now following Xiǎo Sòng [小宋], Lù [陆], and Wáng [王] versions.)*\n**Wáng** [王] says: *Four* [四] has already attained its proper place and occurs at *day* [昼].\nTo depart from it is fitting.\nDeparting from the son to follow the father,\nDeparting from the minister to follow the lord—\nThis aligns with the order of reverence and subordination,\nAnd thus no blame or regret arises.\n\n**Guāng** [光] says: *Four* [四] is the beginning of *fortune*, occurring at *day* [昼].\nTo depart from the low and attain the high is fortune beyond expectation,\nHence it is said *\"not what one expects.\"*\n\n**Fifth Line:**\n*\"He grasps his garments,\nTo the courtyard where there are* **mí** [麋].\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Grasping his garments with* **mí** [麋]\"—this is also cause for dread.\n**Xiǎo Sòng** [小宋] says: *\"Grasp\"* [攓] is pronounced *qiān* [愆], meaning to lift.\n**Guāng** [光] says: *\"Grasping his garments and moving\"*—there are thorns and brambles in the courtyard.\nA *mí* [麋] deer wandering in the courtyard is a sign of a ruined state.\nFear and dread arise from these emotions,\nAnd *five* [五] represents *garments*, holding an elevated position but occurring at *night* [夜].\nHe is about to depart from his station and lose his state—how could he not fear?\n\n**Sixth Line:**\n*\"He himself departs from* **chéng** [成], *heaven bestows its name upon him.\"\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"He himself departs from* **chéng** [成]\"—this is the virtue of *retreating without lingering*.\n*(Xiǎo Sòng [小宋] and Lù [陆] originally read *chéng* [城]; now following Fàn [范] and Wáng [王] versions.)*\n*Rǎng* [攘] is the ancient form of *ràng* [让].\n*Yí* [遗] is pronounced *yuè* [醉].\n**Fàn** [范] says: *Six* [六] is the position of *uppermost blessing*, and the nature of his family is to depart.\nWhen his work is complete, he retires—thus heaven bestows his name upon him.\n\n**Seventh Line:**\n*\"He departs from* **dézhēn** [德贞], *three deaths do not cease.\"\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"Depart from* **dézhēn** [德贞]\"—this is the end of shameful ruin.\n**Fàn** [范] says: *\"Lìng* [令]\" means *good*.\n**Wáng** [王] says: *Seven* [七] is in a position of excess and has already lost its place, occurring at *night* [夜].\n*Guāi* [乖]—it is fitting to depart from it.\nTo depart from what is *evil* is nothing compared to abandoning one’s *virtue, power, and uprightness* [德贞].\nThus, even though three deaths may come,\nThere remains the name of *\"not ceasing\"* [不令]—it is not extinguished.\n*Three* [三] here means *many*.\n\n**Eighth Line:**\n*\"The moon is high in its arc,\nThe fire is near its suspension—\nOne cannot stir, stirring brings* **qiān** [愆].\n**Cè** [测] says: *\"The moon arcs, the fire suspends\"*—this is cause for fearing blame.\n*Jī* [几] is pronounced *qí* [祈] or *jī* [居衣].\n*Suspension* [县] is the ancient form of *xuán* [悬].\n**Fàn** [范] says: *\"The moon is high in its arc\"*—this is beyond the twenty-day mark.\n*Fire* [火] refers to *Dàhuǒ* [大火].\nWhen the fire is near suspension, the year is drawing to a close.\n*Eight* [八] is the position of *old age and infirmity*, corresponding to eighty years in one’s lifespan.\nAs the moon wanes when stirred, and the fire’s days decline,\nHe retires from office, leaving his *chēng* [成] (accomplished work) behind,\nAnd entrusts his teachings to the younger generation—\nHe cannot stir recklessly, lest he bring calamity.\n\nGuang says: *\"Within the fire, cold and heat withdraw.*\nEight marks decay, like peeling—\nAs when a man grows old and frail,\nHe should remain still, not stir.\n\n*Upper Nine*: Seeking myself, I find none—\nI turn toward the west-north.\nCè says: *\"Seeking myself, how can I endure?\"*\nLittle Song cites *Xuántú* [玄图]: *\"No yang is born like the Child—\nWest-north, and the Child’s beauty is spent.\"*\n\nGuang says: *\"West-north is the yin position;\nNine marks exhaustion, annihilation—\nAt the peak of departure, facing night.\nAlready gone, so I seek in vain.\nLike the sun and the year,\nMoving from west into north—\nHow can they endure long?\"*\n\nThree regions, two states, two departments, one household grow dark.\nThe Yang family’s gold aligns with *Míngyí* [明夷].\n\nEntering darkness, the seventh rank—\nThe sun lodges in *Fáng* [房].\nYin ascends upon yang, yang descends into yin—\nAll things lose their brightness.\n*Hom* [丧], pronounced *xīlàng* [息浪].\n\nWang says: *\"All things rely on yang for brightness;\nWhen yang descends, they lose their light.\"*\n\n*First Rank*: Like the void, yet alone seeing *yōuzhēn* [幽贞].\nCè says: *\"Like the void, yet alone seeing—\nThis is the central illumination.\"*\n\nWang says: *\"In the dark and dim,\nYet occupying the proper position,\nThus: ‘Like the void, yet alone seeing.’\nGuarding oneself in the depths of obscurity,\nWithout losing its rectitude.\"*\n\nGuang says: *\"One marks ‘thought below,’\nAlso ‘below below,’\nFitting the sun’s position,\nThus able to see *yōuzhēn*.\"*\n\n*Second Rank*: Blind, advancing into *pǐ* [否].\nCè says: *\"Blind, advancing into *pǐ*—\nBrightness does not see the Way.\"*\n\n*Pǐ*, pronounced *fāngjiǔ* [方久], differs from *bù* [不同].\nWang says: *\"In darkness and dimness,\nYet losing the proper position for night—\nFurther darkened.\nThen, blindly advancing,\nThere must be fear of stumbling.\"*\n\nGuang says: *\"Two marks ‘thought in the middle,’\nYet facing night,\nThus this symbol arises.\"*\n\n*Third Rank*: Yin moves, yang follows—\nFavorable to action, not ominous.\nCè says: *\"Yin moves, yang follows—\nMatters extend outward.\"*\n\nWang and Range’s text reads *\"must\"* (*bì* [必]), now following Song and Lu’s *\"action\"* (*zuò* [作]).\n\n*Fourth Rank*: Its kind grows dark—\nLosing the *jīnkuì* [金匮].\nCè says: *\"Its kind grows dark—\nLaws and measures decay.\"*\n\nRange says: *\"Four is metal.\nYet in its course,\nIn an age of darkness,\nThus: ‘Its kind grows dark.’\"*\n\nGuang says: *\"Laws and measures uphold the state,\nLike the *kuì* [匮] securing gold.\nWithin a single state,\nThere may be darkness and brightness—\nLaws and measures may still be upheld.\nBut if darkness prevails and is further obscured,\nConforming to flattery,

moon reaches its peak—\nThe virtuous man hides himself, does not enter *qióng* [穷].\nCè says: *\"Sun central, moon at its height—\nBrightness fears being blunted.\"*\n\nWang says: *\"Five marks central harmony,\nYet also occupies the proper position.\nAt the sun’s zenith and moon’s fullness,\nYet restraining excess,\nHiding his traces.\nHaving grasped the principles of waxing and waning,\nFlexion and extension,\nHis Way does not reach exhaustion.\"*\n\n*Sixth Rank*: The *Xuānnǎo* [玄鸟] bears sorrow—\nBrightness descends into obscurity.\nCè says: *\"The *Xuānnǎo* bears sorrow—\nIt will descend into dimness.\"*\n\nWang says: *\"The *Xuānwū* [玄乌], the knowing crow.\nSix is at peak fullness,\nYet loses the proper position for night—\nA symbol of departing brightness toward obscurity.\"*\n\nLittle Song says: *\"The *Xuānwū* is *yǐ* [乙].*\nGuang says: *\"Six marks *kuòtiān* [廓天],\nVenturing into early autumn—\nThus this symbol arises.\"*\n\n*Seventh Rank*: *Tí* [提] the brightness—\nOr follow its path.\nCè says: *\"*Tí* the brightness—\nVirtue will follow its course.\"*\n\nSong and Lu’s text reads *\"shèng\"* [睄], pronounced *xījǐng* [息井], meaning *\"provincial\"* (*shěng* [省]), or *\"awaken\"* (*xǐng* [醒]).\nLittle Song pronounces it *miǎo* [眇], meaning *\"one-eyed\"* (*yīmáng* [一目盲]).\nSong and Lu’s *\"tí\"* reads *\"dí\"* [𠫗], pronounced *dōulí* [都黎].\nAll other commentaries omit *\"virtue\"* (*dé* [德]).\nRange’s text reads *\"shèng tí míng dé\"* [睄提明德], mistakenly following Cè.\nRange says: *\"*Shèng* [睄] and *shào* [哨]—\nBlindness of the eyes.\"*\nMeaning aligns with *miǎo* [眇].\nNow following Wang’s text.\n\n---\n\n**Wang’s text** omits the *\"follow\"* (*zūn*) character in *Cè*’s commentary.

acting—\nif madness and delusion are improper, they cannot be concealed.\nThus, at the time of completion, one must be cautious before acting.\n\n**Fourth hexagram:** Ceasing at *tóng* wood,\nseeking its sparse grains.\n*Ce* says:\n*\"Ceasing at *tóng* wood—\nits seeking is exhausted.\"*\n\nThe *Fan* edition reads *\"seeking its exhaustion\"*—\nhere we follow the *Song* and *Lu* editions.\n*Wang*

cannot maintain harmony.\"*\n\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *líng* (陵) for *líng* (凌); we follow the *Fàn*, *Wáng*, and *Xiǎo Sòng* editions.\n**Sòng** says:\n*\"Harmony—centrality.\"*\n\n**Fàn** says:\n*\"In the month of firm ice,\ntoday it does not overbear—\nperhaps the *Yáng* *qi* drains within.\"*\n\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"Three is completed intention,\nand it belongs to night.\nThe petty

ice that seeks to harden on the outside\nwhile its *yáng* *qi* leaks within—\nit can never truly take form.\n\nNext, the fourth: the small wasp buzzes busily,\nits *shān* and *yǐng* unsealed.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The small wasp buzzes busily—\nthis is its lineage.\"*\n\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* editions read *yíng* (荧) for *yíng* (营), omitting *zài* (在).\nThe *Wáng* edition reads *fèn* (分) for *jiè* (介).\n**Wú** says:\n*\"Wasp—same as *fēng* (蜂).\"*\n**Fàn** mistakenly writes *pén* (盆).\n*Shān* (螮) is pronounced *dūjì*.\n*Yǐng* (蛡) is pronounced *shù* or *yì*.\nWe follow the majority for *fēng*,

nest.\"*\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"Shān—same as *dì* (蒂), meaning the wasp’s nest’s base.\nJiè—great.\nShān is used to speak of virtue,\nyǐng to speak of state.\nThe fourth is lower fortune,\nand it belongs to day.\nThe superior man cultivates virtue to preserve his station.\nA state does not depend on size,\nbut on diligent virtue to fortify its root.\nIt is like the small wasp buzzing to build its nest—\nit must first make its base.\nThe nest does not depend on size,\nbut if the base is firm, it will not fall.\"*\n\nNext, the fifth: the *yǐng* is large, the *shān* small—emptiness.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The *yǐng* large, the *shān* small—\nthe state is hollow.\"*\n\n**Fàn** says:\n*\"When a state is small but virtue great,\nthe people are numerous and prosperous;\nwhen a state is great but

state be vast, if virtue is thin,\nlike a wasp’s nest large but its base small—\nits fall will not be long.\nEmptiness—this speaks of outward strength,\nwhile inwardly there is nothing.\"*\n\nNext, the sixth: the *qiān shān* weaves delicately,\nsuspended over the Nine Regions.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The *qiān shān* suspended—\nthe people thrive thereby.\"*\nThe *Xiǎo Sòng* edition reads *shā* (纱) as *yōu* (幽), meaning \"subtle appearance,\" but we follow the majority.\n*Tiě* (铁) is the same as *xiān* (纤).\n*Xuán* (悬) is the same as *xián* (县).\n**Wáng** says:\n*\"Shā—same as *miǎo*

path.\"*\n*Diān* (颠) means \"top.\"\nThe seventh is lost resolve,\nruin, descending the mountain,\nand it belongs to night.\nThe petty man is strong yet ignorant,\nlike using his firm top to advance,\ncolliding with the mound—\nhe does not know where to go.*\n\nNext, the eighth:\nFirmness brings calamity—\nonly the *jiě* *huò* can rectify it.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Firmness brings calamity—\nthis is the use of straightness and rectitude.\"*\n*Huò* (祸) is the same as *hù* (怙).\n*Jiě* (解) is the same as *xièzhì* (獬豸).\n\nThe King says:\n*\"**Jiě** (解) is the beast that strikes the perverse.\"*\n\n**Zè** (测) explains:\n*\"Eight is calamity at its peak, striking during the day—\nit relies upon its firmness yet provokes disaster.\"*\n\nYet the **Way** of the virtuous lies in striking the perverse;\nthough firm and stepping into calamity,\nthey do not lose their rectitude.\n\nNext, the ninth:\nFirmness brings calamity—\nonly the **jiě** **huò** (解祸) can rectify it.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Firmness brings calamity—\nthis is the use of straightness and rectitude.\"*\n**Huò** (祸) is the same as **hù** (怙).\n**Jiě** (解) is the same as **xièzhì** (獬豸).\n\n---\n\nThe King says:\n*\"**Jiě** (解) is the beast that strikes the perverse.\"*\n\n**Guāng** (光) states:\n*\"Eight is at the height of calamity, striking during the day—\nit is one who leans upon firmness yet incurs disaster.\"*\n\nYet the **Way** of the virtuous lies in striking the perverse;\nthough firm and stepping into calamity,\nthey do not lose their rectitude.\n\nNext, the upper ninth:\nBees burn their wings,\nperishing upon the corpse.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Bees burn their wings—\ntheir reliance is lost.\"*\n*(The text of Sòng (宋) and Lù (陆) reads: \"Bees consume their wings,\" but we follow Fàn (范),

(翼).\"*\nNine is calamity’s utmost,\nstriking during the night.\nThe petty man’s firmness in vice\nreaches the point of ruining his house—\nlike bees burning their own nest,\nlosing their master.\n\nThe *Yì* (易) says:\n*\"A bird burns its nest—\nthree directions, three states, one family becomes yang.\"*\n*(The yang family perishes, the water is exhausted—\nthis follows the pattern of *Jì* (既济).)*\nUpon entering the ninth, the day is called *\"Shě Jī\"* (舍箕).\nThe **yin-qi** is now pure,\nthe **yang-qi** concealed within the **Líng** (灵).\nThings achieve completion in

**Líng** (灵).\"*\nLù says:\n*\"Pure (**qīng** 清), means cold.\"*\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"The yang-qi hides within the earth,\n**Gǎng** (港) is the master of things.\nThings depend upon it to achieve completion,\nthus attaining their form.\"*\n\nFirst, the one:\nIf completion is like ruin,\nits use will not cease—\n**míng** (冥).\n**Zè** says:\n*\"If completion is like ruin,\nthis is why it does not fail.\"*\n\nWáng’s text reads only one *\"gǎi\"* (改),\nbut we follow the other versions.\nWáng says:\n*\"At the start of completion,\nthough in proper position during the day,\nif the work is like ruin,\nand one does not boast of its success,\nthen its use will not cease—\nand **míng** (冥) will align with the **Dao**.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"One is thinking downward,\nstriking during the day.\nThe **Way** of the virtuous,\nthough silent, shines forth daily.\n**Míng** (冥) is hidden yet not displayed.\nThe *Lǎozǐ* (老子) says:\n*'When success is achieved, do not dwell upon it.*\n*He who does not dwell upon it,\nwill not be abandoned by it.'*\"*\n\nNext, the two:\nCompletion is slight, yet change is repeated—\nnot yet complete yet already in peril.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Completion is slight yet change is repeated—\nit cannot fulfill itself.\"*\n\nWáng’s text has only one *\"gǎi\"* (改),\nbut we follow the other versions.\nWáng says:\n*\"Having lost its position at night,\nthough completion is still slight,\nif it is changed again,\nthen the matter will surely not complete,\nand danger will ensue.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"Two is reversal,\nstriking during the night.\nThe petty man’s heart is not steadfast,\nand thus he will never succeed.\nThe *Yì* (易) says:\n*'Jìn advances like the weasel or rat—\nrectitude is perilous.'*\"*\n\nNext, the three:\nCompletion leaps yet contracts,\ncompletion flies yet does not pursue.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Completion leaps yet contracts—\nthe virtue of completion is strong.\"*\n\nWáng says:\n*\"When the matter is already complete,\nit leaps forward yet again,\nthen contracts and retreats—\nknowing self-restraint and caution,\nit advances without fault.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"Three is completion in intent,\nstriking during the day.\nThe virtuous, when facing affairs, are cautious—\nleaping and contracting, undecided.\nThis is so because,\nwhen the matter is complete,\nit is like a bird taking flight—\nno longer able to be driven back,\nthus advance and retreat must be measured with care.\nThe *Yì* (易) says:\n*'Or leaps into the abyss—\nno fault.'*\"*\n\nNext, the four:\nOn the verge of completion, arrogance leads to ruin.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The arrogance of one on the verge of completion—\nthis is a flaw in the **Way** of completion.\"*\n\nWáng says:\n*\"Having lost its position at night,\nthis is one on the verge of completion,\nyet arrogant—\nit will surely ruin its success.\nThe **Way** of success\nhates arrogance and self-aggrandizement.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"Four is the decline of fortune,\nthus it is on the verge of completion.\nStriking during the night,\nhence it is arrogant.\nAt the **Kuìqiū** (葵丘) gathering,\nQi Huánggōng (齐桓公) was arrogant and boastful,\nand nine states rebelled against him.\"*\n\nNext, the five:\nCompletion stands alone in the center—\ngreatness.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Completion stands alone in the center—\nit can dwell in the middle.\"*\n\n*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: \"Completion is able to stand in the center,\" but we follow the other versions.)*\nFive is the utmost of **harmony** and **center**,\nstriking during the day—\nthe **Son of Heaven**’s work is complete,\nalone wielding the **Huángjí** (皇极),\nto govern the four quarters,\na radiant virtue and achievement.*\n\nNext, the six:\nCompletion is **arcane** and **fragmented**,\nusing completion to gain calamity.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The arcane fragmentation of completion—\nit does not act with humility.\"*\n\n*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: \"Completion is arcane and fragmented, fragmented,\" but we follow the other versions.)*\n*(Fàn’s text reads: \"humility (**qiān** 谦)\" as \"yielding (**ràng** 让),\" but we follow Sòng, Lù, and Wáng here.)*\nWáng says:\n*\"Six dwells in fullness yet loses its position at night,\nthough it is the chief of completion,\nit harbors fragmented and petty actions within—\nit will surely fall from its success and incur calamity.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"Six is the utmost of completion,\nstriking during the night.\nWhen great success is achieved,\nmany desire to share in its glory.\nThe one who leads it,\nhaving already exhausted their greatness,\nmust distribute even the minutiae to others,\nand thus all will rejoice.\nIf they wish to retain both greatness and small,\nthey will be hated by the multitude,\nand instead, through their success,\nthey will gain calamity.\"*\n\nNext, the seven:\nCompletion is **obstructed**—\n**repair** (补).\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The repair of completion’s obstruction—\nit is indeed difficult to uphold.\"*\n\n*(Sòng and Lù’s text reads: \"depend on (**yī** 依),\" but we follow Fàn and Wáng here.)*\nFàn says:\n*\"Seven is lost resolve,\nhence it is obstructed.\nThe **Way** of the virtuous\nis good at repairing faults,\nthus when there is obstruction,\nthey repair it.\"*\n\nWáng says:\n*\"Beneath completion,\nit is difficult to uphold—\none must consider the **Way** of repairing errors.\"*\n\nNext, the eight:\nThe time for completion is ripe yet not achieved—\n**Heaven** descends **perilous rectitude**.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"The time for completion is ripe yet not achieved—\nit alone loses the center.\"*\n\nWáng’s text reads *\"zhǐ\"* (止) instead of *\"wáng\"* (亡),\nbut we follow the other versions.\nFàn says:\n*\"Eight is wood,\nthe harvest of autumn.\"*\n\n**Guāng** states:\n*\"The petty man,\nwhen the time for completion is ripe yet not achieved,\nlacks the **virtue** to complete it,\nlosing the center of time,\nthus **Heaven** descends blame\nand he loses rectitude.\"*\n\nUpper ninth:\nCompletion reaches **exhaustion** and enters ruin—\n**destroying** completion,\nthe virtuous do not complete.\n**Zè** says:\n*\"Completion reaches exhaustion and is destroyed—\nthe virtuous bring it to an end.\"*\n\n*(Xiǎo Sòng’s text reads: \"The petty man destroys completion,\" but we follow the other versions.)*\nNine is the **end of exhaustion**,\nstriking during the day.\nThe sun at its zenith then declines;\nthe moon at its fullness then wanes—\ncompletion reaches exhaustion and enters ruin,\nthe natural order of things.\nRuination then destroys its completion.\nThe virtuous, knowing that completion must be ruined,\nconstantly restrain and diminish themselves,\nso as not to reach completion,\nthus ensuring their lasting fortune and blessings.*\n\n「Yǒng Yóu Jī#12 departs a

The boat and carriage are the means of governance; the worthy are also the means to govern the world. The one who loses aspiration is the master of calamity, hence the **lurching and stumbling**; abandoning the means of governance brings self-harm, so the danger is not distant.\n\n**Guāng** says: Seven marks the **beginning of disaster** and corresponds to **night**, hence this symbol. When a state is about to fall, it first abandons its worthy advisors.\n\n**Eighth day:** The **young** are in the **abyss**, the **elder** abandons the boat.\n**Cè** says: The elder abandons the boat—**to rescue the drowning world**.\n**Fàn** says: The young refer to the **common people**. In times of calamity, as though in an abyss, the elder abandons the boat to save them.\n**Guāng** says: Eight is **the midst of disaster**, yet corresponds to **day**, hence this symbol.\n\n**Ninth day:** The **scarlet silkworm** clings to the **dead mulberry**, its cocoon not **yellow**.\n**Cè** says: Clinging to the dead mulberry and not yielding yellow—**the silkworm’s labor is ruined**.\nThe **Fàn** manuscript reads *\"clings to the dead mulberry, not yellow\"* as *\"clings to the dead mulberry\"* and *\"its cocoon not yellow\"*, while the **Wáng** manuscript reads *\"dead mulberry, not yellow\"*, and I follow the **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts here.\n**Fàn** says: When the silkworm first emerges, its **bristles** are red like those of the aged, hence the **scarlet**.\n**Wáng** says: Nine dwells at the **ultimate peak**, yet loses its position and corresponds to **night**, with nowhere to turn. The **scarlet silkworm** is the **ailing silkworm**. But clinging to the **dead mulberry**, how could it ever form its cocoon? **Not yellow** means **unfruitful**.\n\n**Threefold calamity in three states and three regions**—**one household’s ruin**#25.\n**Dàn** (danger) is pronounced *nǎi* (to endure).\n**Yang** household calamity is measured by **obstruction**; **Yīn** *qi* is **threefold difficulty**, with water **congealing** and earth **cracking**, while **yang** is weak in the abyss.\nThe **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *\"Yīn qi fāng nǎn\"* (difficulty of **Yīn** *qi*) as *\"Tài yīn nǎn\"* (ultimate **Yīn** difficulty), and I follow the other manuscripts here.\n**Xiǎo Sòng** says: When **Yīn** reaches its **ultimate extremity**, **yang** *qi* arrives with **reassurance**, and **Yīn** fears **yang**, causing **great peril and difficulty**.

The **heart** can **fortify and endure**, obstructing and suppressing **extraordinary forces**.\n\n**Fourth day:** The **egg cracks the stone**, **ruined**#29.\n**Cè** says: The **egg cracks the stone** and is **ruined**—**the calamity of the lowly**.\nThe **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts read *\"calamity\"* as *zá* (mixed), and I follow the **Fàn** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.\n**Ruined** is pronounced *túwàn* (to play idly).\n**Wáng** says: In times of **calamity**, losing its position and corresponding to **night**, one does not know the **way of calamity**. Hence, when the **egg cracks the stone**, it is **ruined**, and **unfruitfulness** is certain.\n\n**Fifth day:** **Calamity** without **interval**, though great, it is **not laborious**.\n**Cè** says: **Calamity** without **interval**—**the heart is sealed and closed**.\n**Wáng** says: Obtaining its position in the center, it becomes the **master of calamity**. It can **block and seal** the onset, leaving no **interval**, so that disaster has no way to enter. Even in the midst of **great calamity**, one avoids harm without exertion.\n\n**Sixth day:** The **great carriage** moves **heavily**#30, **upward** on the **mountain**, **downward** into the **river**.\n**Cè** says: The **great carriage** moves **heavily**—**upward and downward, obstructed**.\nThe **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts read *\"heavily\"* as *chuánchuán*.\n**Wú** says: **River** is pronounced *biān* (ford), but the **Fàn, Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts read *\"obstructed\"* as *yù* (to block), and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ** manuscripts here.\n**Wú** says: **To block** is pronounced *kǔhǎi* (bitter sea).\n**Yù** is pronounced *érzhèn* (to shake).\n**Fàn** says: **Heavy movement** is the **appearance of delay**.\n**Wáng** says: Six dwells in **abundance and fullness**, yet loses its position and corresponds to **night**, unable to avoid **calamity’s proper course**.\n\n**Seventh day:** **Pulling up the stone**, **strength is exhausted** in the effort.\n**Cè** says: **Pulling up the stone**—**seizing the moment**.\nThe **Fàn** manuscript reads *\"exhausted\"* as *jìn* (to finish), and I follow the **Sòng, Lǔ**, and **Wáng** manuscripts here.\n**Pulling** is pronounced *zhìrén* (the person).」\n\n「The **Sòng** says: **\"Time\"** refers to the **day** (daytime).\n**Fàn** says: **Stone** is used to signify **difficulty**. **川川**—the **appearance of difficulty** (or calamity).\n\n**Wáng** says: When **Yin-qi** reaches its extreme, even if frozen and solidified like **congealed ice**, there is **fearful dread** (戁) and **injury** (恐) from **external assaults**. Though **Yang-qi** is still faint, it will **collide** (邸) with the **obscure** (冥) and **encounter** (触) its **darkness** (昧), revealing its **strength** (膂力) within. As **Yin-qi** reaches its peak and **Yang-qi** begins to rise, the **symbol** (象) reflects **toil and exertion**.\n\n**First line:** **Toil in deliberation**, **obstructed integrity** (否贞).\n**Cè** says: **Toil in deliberation** and **obstructed integrity**—**the center is not upright** (中不正也).\nThe **Fàn, Wáng**, and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts lack the character **\"deliberation\"** (谋), which I adopt from the **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts here.\n**Wáng** says: At the **beginning of toil**, yet **losing position** (失位) as **night**, it is **toil without adherence to the Dao/Way** (勤而不以其道者也). **Obstructed integrity** means **not upright** (不正之谓也).\n**Guāng** says: **One** marks the **start of thought**, the **beginning of toil and exertion**. As it belongs to the **toil family** yet aligns with **night**, hence this **symbol**.\n\n**Second line:** **Toil with favor**, **exertion earnest and sincere** (勤悾悾), the **noble one finds harmony** (君子有中).\n**Cè** says: **Toil with favor** and **earnest exertion**—**it encompasses all emotions** (有诸情也). **悾悾**—pronounced *kōng* (empty), akin to **reverent** (款款).\n**Wáng** says: **Two** **gains position** (得位) as **day**, **adhering to the Dao/Way of toil**. **Toil with favor**—**exertion that is not wasted** (勤不虚施者也). **悾悾**—**reverent and sincere**, **unflagging in toil** (勤之而款款, 不倦其勤者也). Moreover, **the noble one’s harmony** (君子之中道) is attained, so what **fault or regret** (咎悔) could possibly arise?\n**Guāng** says: **Harmony** (中)—**sincere devotion** (至诚). **Two** marks the **midpoint of thought**, aligning with **day**. The **noble one** **fulfills loyalty** (尽忠) toward others; **favor and toil** (恩斯勤斯) are sincere and **earnest** (悾悾), not merely superficial expressions.\n\n**Third line:** **Bound and constrained** (羁角), **my lament is incessant** (泣呱呱), **yet lacking embrace and support** (未得襁扶).\n**Cè** says: **Bound and constrained**—**unable to fulfill its mandate** (不得命也).\nThe **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *\"yet lacking\"* (未得) as *\"yet without\"* (未有), which I follow from the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Fàn** manuscripts here. The **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts read *\"support\"* (扶) as *\"staff\"* (杖), which I follow from the **Wáng** manuscript here.\n**呱呱**—the sound of weeping.\n**Wáng** says: **Male** (角) and **female** (羁)—**ornaments for children**. **吾吾**—**restless and aimless**. **呱呱**—**cries**. **襁**—to **embrace**; **扶**—to **hold**. If a child **cries in distress** (吾吾然无所归之貌), yet **cannot be embraced or held** (不得长者抱持之) by elders, even if **toiling in sorrow**, it will **never find resolution**. This illustrates **three**, when **toil and difficulty** (劳苦) are at their height, yet **losing position** (失位) as **night**, **with nowhere to turn**; hence the **symbol**.\n\n**Fourth line:** **Toil in strength**, **abandoning subservience** (放陪), **forgetting sustenance** (忘食), the **great person achieves victory** (大人有克).\n**Cè** says: **Toil in strength**, **forgetting sustenance**—**the virtue/power of the great person** (大人德).\nThe **Fàn** manuscript reads *\"subservience\"* (陪) as *\"doubling\"* (倍), which I follow from the **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts here.\nThe **Sòng** and **Lǔ** manuscripts read *\"virtue/power\"* (德) as *\"attainment\"* (得), which I follow from the **Fàn, Wáng, and Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.\n**放**—pronounced *fǔwàng* (to abandon).\n**Wáng** says: As **toil in the Dao/Way** grows **profound**, yet **gains position** (得位) as **day**, **without losing its proper course** (不失其宜). This is when, **amidst toil and difficulty**, one can **strengthen its efforts** (勤其力), **abandoning subservience** (放乎陪隶之事), and **forgetting the rewards of sustenance** (忘其禄食之报). Only **the great person** (大人) can **achieve this**, leading to **success**.\n\n**Guāng** says: **Four** marks the **lower rank of sustenance**, yet **aligns with day**; hence this **symbol**.\n\n**Fifth line:** **Frenzied and stumbling** (狂蹇蹇), **calamity is near** (祸迩), **fortune is distant** (福远).\n**Cè** says: **Frenzied stumbling**—**fortune is far away** (远乎福也).\nThe **Sòng, Lǔ, and Fàn** manuscripts read *\"frenzied\"* (狂) as *\"to go\"* (往), which I follow from the **Wáng** and **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscripts here.\n**Wáng** says: **Five** **dwells in a position of abundance**, yet **loses position** (失位) as **night**. **Toil** (勤) **greatly departs from its proper course** (大失其宜), hence the **symbol of frenzy and stumbling**. **Fortune is distant** (福远), **while calamity is near** (祸迩).\n\n**Sixth line:** **Toil achieves success**, **approaching the heavens** (几于天).\n**Cè** says: **Toil achieves success**—**heavenly aid arrives** (天所来辅).\nThe **Sòng, Lǔ, and Wáng** manuscripts read *\"approaching the heavens\"* (几于天) as *\"heavenly nearness\"* (天夹).\n**Sòng** says: **夹**—**nearness**.\n**Lǔ** says: **夹**—**harmony**.\nThe **Xiǎo Sòng** manuscript reads *\"heavenly nearness\"* (天夹), which I follow from the **Fàn** manuscript here.\n**Wáng** says: **Six** **dwells in a position of abundance**, yet **gains position** (得位) as **day**; hence, **\"toil achieves success\"** (勤有成功). **几**—**nearness**.\n\n**Seventh line:** **Toil drags, yet not by the nose**, **but by the tail** (于尾), **exhausted** (弊).\n**Cè** says: **The exhaustion of toil**—**its Dao/Way is contrary** (其道逆也).\n**Fàn** says: **Dragging an ox by the tail** (牵牛不其鼻, 而尾) **causes exhaustion**; hence, **toil is exhausted** (故劳弊也).\n\nGuāng says: **\"Seven\"** is **a rope**, is **a cord**, and also **lost resolve**—yet it corresponds to night, hence this symbol.\n\n**Eighth line:** **Toil is restless** (踖踖), **the heart is weary** (心爽), **the blindfolded ox refuses to move** (蒙柴不却).\n**Cè** says: **Toil wearies the heart**—**it is a sacrifice to the state**.\n\n**Tread** (踖), pronounced *wú zī xī* (吴资昔切), **Xiao Sòng** reads it as *què* (鹊).\n\n**Ninth line, at the apex:** **His toil, his toil!** **He carries a chariot into the abyss**, **drags a boat up the mountain**.\n**Cè** says: **His toil, his toil!** **Toil finds no reward**.\n**Wáng** says: **Nine dwells in the extreme height**, yet **loses its proper time** (当夜), **toiling without the Dao/Way**.\n\n**Three directions, three states, three regions, three households**—**nurturing the Yang family’s gold**, **aligned with the chin** (准颐).\n**At the end of Nine**, **heaven’s measure of qi remains**, **yet still has sixty minutes, twenty-four seconds**.\n**Tread** (踦) **should be forty minutes sixteen seconds**, **Excess** (赢) **should be twenty minutes eight seconds**.\n**Yin swells upon the wilds**, **Yang nurtures all things**, **their hue is red below**.\n**Sòng and Lǔ** read **弸 (弸)** as **胎 (tāi)**, **Wáng** as **殆 (dài)**;

presented earlier; the preface is omitted to avoid repetition.\n\nThe **mysterious patterns** of the **cosmic whole**—\nOne yin and one yang interweave,\nYet harmonized by the **Three**—this is how they function.\n\nThe **Mysterious** encompasses **Three Systems**,\nAnd within them, one yang governs one system,\nGiving rise to all things.\n\nFrom the **regions, states, districts, and households**,\nEach follows the **One, Two, or Three**—\nThis is called **the dispersion of the Three Positions**.\n\nIt is said: *\"Arrange the Nine Nines,*\nTo calculate the birth of all things.\"\n\nThe **Nine Circuits** flow cyclically with voids,\nEstablishing divisions to disperse—\nLife perpetuates without end.\n\n**Praise to the Supreme Principles**—\nThis is the **opening discourse**.\n\nNow it gathers names,\nSystematizing the **Mysterious lineage**.\n\n**The Mysterious Origin**—\nThe opening text is scattered beneath the scriptures and is omitted here to avoid repetition.\n\nThe *Yì* divides the **hexagrams** to govern the calendar:\nEach line represents one day,\nAnd sixty hexagrams complete the **360-day cycle**.\n\n**Kǎn, Lǐ, Zhèn, and Duì** serve as the **Four Cardinal Directors** in their seasons.\n\nThe **solstices and equinoxes** mark the four seasons,\nEach line representing one **qi**,\nAnd four hexagrams completing the **24 seasonal qi**.\n\nThe *Commentary* states:\n*\"The *Jiǎzǐ* hexagram-qi begins with *Zhōngfá*.\"*\n\nSeven parts of the **80% day**—\nThis is the **beginning of the Mysterious Scriptures**.\n\n*Zhōngfá* governs the **first sign of Winter Solstice**—\nThe so-called *\"earthworms knotting.\"*\n\nFrom the **first day of the cycle** to the **third day of the revolution**,\nIt is then **received by *Fù* (Repetition).**\n\n*Fù* governs the **second sign**—\nThe so-called *\"deer antlers shedding.\"*\n\nFrom the **fourth day of the revolution** to the **sixth day of *Lún* (Abundance)**,\nIt is then **received by *Tún* (Difficulty).**\n\n*Tún* governs the **third sign**—\nThe so-called *\"waters and springs moving.\"*\n\nFrom the **seventh day of *Lún*** to the **ninth day of *Xián* (Dispersion)**,\nThe **three hexagrams’ qi** are now complete.\n\nEach hexagram has a remainder—\nSeven parts of the **80% day**—\nOverlapping and interwoven to form the whole.\n\nAt the year’s end, the **sixty hexagrams** govern the **Eighty-One Mysterious Origins**,\nAnd the **Mysterious qi** permeates thus.\n\nTherefore, some hexagrams recur—\nFor the **qi’s numbers** flow between Heaven and Earth,\nEncountering obstacles that remain unresolved,\nOr erupting chaotically without control—\nThus the hexagrams mirror these phenomena.\n\nThey accumulate and connect sequentially,\nHence the **twenty-one Origins** share similarities.\n\nScholars who dismiss the **four-seasonal hexagrams**\nAnd claim *\"Lǐ corresponds to separation, Zhèn to doubt, Duì to stagnation, Kǎn to

after it.\n\nBy day, the **yang** promotes the **Five Blessings** in ascending order,\nBy night, the **yin** descends through the **Six Extremes**.\n\nAscension and descent are interdependent,\nThus the **Origins** are established to measure **transformations**.\n\nOne and Six form the **North**,\nTwo and Seven form the **South**—this is the **vertical axis**.\n\nThree and Eight form the **East**,\nFour and Nine form the **West**—this is the **horizontal axis**.\n\nThe **Central Five** mark the **Pole**,\nAlso serving as the **vertical axis**.\n\nThe **Six *Jiǎ* (Stems)** strike between them,\nWhile the **Sun** moves inversely,\nMeeting the **Big Dipper**—\nFor the Dipper moves in order.\n\nThe Dipper aligns with the **month** to establish the **four seasons**,\nAnd the **Sun** meets it once,\nCompleting **366 days** in the year.\n\nWhen **years, months, days, and times** remain unaltered,\nAll grains flourish—\nThus the **Mysterious Collision** governs the world,\nIlluminating the **bright**, nurturing the **talented people**,\nAnd bringing **peace and prosperity** to households.\n\n**The Mysterious Collision (Text)**\nThe **divination text** is scattered beneath the various **praises** and is omitted here to avoid repetition.\n\nXu Hàn’s annotations are incomplete.\n**The Mysterious Collision**.»\n\nThe **Central** marks the **beginning of

great, they scorn you—*\nThis is the speech of the **mad**.\"\n\n**Approach** should be **gradual**,\n**Loss** should be **swift**.\n\n**Above**, **dryness** generates **madness**,\n**Ying**, **excess** generates **curvature**.\n\nThe **Records** say:\n*\"Rite is shaped by the land.\"*\n\nFrom **response** to **rite**, it is fully realized in **royal governance**.\n\nYet if **uprightness** cannot prevail, one **flees**—\nThis is the **joy of retreat**.\n\n**Rite** and **text** arise from **external deviation**,\nThen **strengthen the world**.\n\nFamilies without the **‘also’** character—**Song** has it.\n\n**Excess** is **private curvature**;\n**Tang** is **public** without **desire**.\n\n**Difference** is **error**;\nYet **constant grain**.\n\nFrom **excess**, private curvature—\n**Movement** errs and **oversteps**.\n\nFrom **Tang**, public without desire—\n**Guarding constancy** and **abundance**,\nThus the **cultivator of heart** takes warning.\n\n**Tang** is the **great heart**.\n**Constancy** is the **Way** of **ten thousand ages** of **lord and subject**.\n\nThe **preface** of **Ru Lǐ Gōng** on the **lord and subject’s Way** says:\n*\"From this beginning, the year shall have [its harvest].\"*\n\nThe **Noble One** has **abundance**,\n**Transmitting** to descendants.\n\nSpeaking of **constant abundance** in **responding** to things by **kind**,\nAnd the year having its **autumn**.\n\n**Rite** withdraws the self to **publicize** the world,\nUntil the **phases of fleeing** and **Tang** have passed,\nYet the **rectitude** of **lord and subject** does not change.\n\nThen **rite** is seen—\nThe **strengthening** of the world’s **function**.\n\nThis is called **retreat as progress**,\n**Publicizing private** to fulfill its **private**.\n\n**Youthful** and **few**—\n**Preeminent** yet **without lack**.\n\n**Few** is **excessive**;\n**Without lack** is **moderation**.\n\n**Youthful**—**benefit** returns in

retreats.\n\n**Following** is **dispersing**;\n**Plummeting** is **gathering**.\n\nFamilies have the **‘also’** character—**Ding** lacks it.\n\n**Advancing** is **many schemes**;\n**Accumulating** is **many riches**.\n\n**Madness** and **simplicity** support **Ying**,\n**Excess** and **brightness** err and **miss**—\nReturning to their **true nature**, the **youthful** bring **auspice**.\n\n**Youthful** with **few**—\n**Excessive** yet **rarely erring**.\n\nFrom **youthful** to **increase**,\n**Pure virtue** flourishes.\n\nHolding **oneness** and **reaching** it,\nExchanging with **kind**—then **movement** arises.\n\nThus **awe** must be present,\nAnd **excess** expelled,\n**Error** warned against,\nWhile **Ying** and **Rui** preserve **virtue**.\n\nThe

**measure** are not **replaced**,\nThe **function** of **rite**.\n\n**Measure** holds **abundance**,\nUntil **lengthening** and **great harmony**,\nThen **changing** to **reduction**,\n**Lip** with all things,\n**Returning** and **guarding** itself.\n\n**Guarding** yet **not firm**,\nThen **entering** to **accumulate**—\nThe **common people’s** affairs.\n\nThe **decadent Zhou** poetry says:\n*\"Like a merchant’s threefold gain—*\nThe **Noble One** recognizes this,\n**Adapting** to the times.\"\n\nWhen **greed for profit** prevails,\nAnd **virtue and righteousness** decline,\nThen what the world **relies on** to act\nIs only **adornment**—\nNot **reaching** **harmony**,\nThus **truth** shines **bright** across the world.\n\nHence **emptiness** and **deception** confuse the

**extension**;\n**Adornment** is **decay**.\n\nThings **approach** to **shed burdens**,\n**Pushed** to **release**;\n**Substance** decays, yet **adornment** is **achieved**.\n\n**Extension** arises from the **inner**,\n**Adornment** is **externally** set.\n\nHuman **truth**—\n**Accumulated force** over time **hangs**, **resolves**, and **shines forth**,\nComing to its time **unbeknownst**.\n\n**Gathering** is **decayed accumulation**,\nThus the **aged** warn against **obtaining**.\n\n**Format**—**liking** is **affirmation**;\nYet **doubt**—**disliking** is **negation**.\n\n**Liking** is already **settled**,\n**Doubt** is **negation** yet **persuaded**—\n**Liking** and **disliking** are **fixed**,\nCalled **formatting things** to **take** this.\n\n**Level** and **flat**—**viewing** the **tilted**.\n\n**Level**—each **finds its own flatness** and **ease**.\n**Viewing**—**mutual tilting**.\n\nThe **Spring and Autumn Commentary** says:\n*\"Yet there is **observation**.\"*\n\n**Holding level** and **cautious of tilting**,\nCan **cultivate virtue**,\nCan **nurture life**.\n\n**Joy**—**uplifting**;\n**Submergence**—**hidden storage**.\n\n**Contention**—**scholar’s equality**;\n**Inner**—**woman’s womb**.\n\nThings **halt** at their **level**,\nThen **joy** in their **emergence** and **contend** in their **guard**.\n\n**Scholar’s equality**—**public’s ultimate**.\n\n「**Woman’s womb**—the **ultimate of private affection**.\n\n**Public triumph**,\nThen all things **reveal themselves mutually**.\n**Private triumph**,\nThen all things **withdraw from each other**.\n\n**Diligence** brings **joy**—\nScholars translate **joy** as *yí* (喜), Xu (许) and Huang (黄) as *xǐ* (憙).\n**Departure** brings **sorrow**.\nSong has no *shì* (事) character—\n*Shàng* (尚) is **pursuit**,\n*Huì* (晦) is **restraint**.\n\n**Change**—**mutual transformation and laughter**;\n**Obscurity**—**prolonged worry**;\n**Disruption**—**excessive matters**;\n**Exhaustion**—**no joy**.\n\nFrom **joy** and **contention** arise **diligence** and **pursuit**,\nFrom **change** and **harmonization** comes **rectification** for the **world**,\nOnly **level and tilting** can be **mastered**—\nThe **great person** alone can **bear this**.\n\nI **judge decisively**,\nThen the **multitude listens**,\nAnd **matters converge**.\n\n**Harmony and ease** flow through things,\nYet **exhaustion** is **unattainable**—\nThis is **joy**.\n\n**Joy** must have **diligence**,\n**Diligence** must have **remorse**,\n**Pursuit** must have **change**,\nWhen **change** occurs, **judgment** and **rectification** prevail.\n\n**Resolute and daring**—\n**To temper softness** with **severity**.\n\n**Displacement**—**relocating settlements**;\n**Restraint**—**no movement**.\n\n**Multitude**—**warmth and gentleness**;\n**Firmness**—**cold and rigidity**.\n\n**Resolute** in **great affairs**,\n**Displacement** seeks **departure**—\nLike **Zhou’s encampment** at **Luoyi**—this is **rectification**.\n\nWhen the **four directions’ folk** gather in **great harmony**,\nIt is the **symbol of warmth and gentleness**.\n\n**Flourishing and decline** reach their **extremes**,\nA **necessary destiny**.\n\nThus, **above**—**resolute and daring**—**actions are taken**,\n**Below**—**the multitude follows with ease and harmony**,\nWhile **displacement** lies within.\n\n**Governance** should **peak at King Cheng’s grandeur**,\nYet **plan for King Ping’s declining era**,\n**Displacement** awaits the **opportune moment**—\nThis is why **Duke Zhou** alone **perceived the subtle threads**.\n\n**Softness restrained**—**no movement**,\n**Firmness upheld**—**to stabilize the tilt**.\n\n**Secrecy**—**unquestionable**;\n**Completion**—**irrevocable**.\n\n**Daring with resolve**—**displacement**,\nWhile **warmth and gentleness** align with **secrecy**,\nAscending by **kindred**.\n\n**Softness tempered by severity**—**restraint**,\n**Cold rigidity preserving its completion**,\nDescending by **examination**.\n\n**Secrecy** is **uninterrupted**—**human nature**;\n**Completion** is **irrevocable**—**heavenly mandate**.\n\n**Human nature**—\n**Resolute yet unharmful**,\n**Naturally inclined to kindness**.\n\n**Heavenly mandate**—\n**Severity tempered yet unbroken**,\n**Capable of nurturing life**.\n\n**Kindness**—**kindness in virtue**;\n**Severity**—**severity in grace**.\n\n**Restraining** gains **fortune**,\n**Losing** brings **misfortune**.\n\n**Strength**—**virtue without weariness**;\n**Excess**—**evil without cessation**.\n\n**Vigilance**—**the **Sovereign’s Way**;\n**Submission**—**the **Minister’s safeguard**.\n\n**Flourishing** yet **approaching decline**,\n**Kindness** must come **before restraint**,\n**Restraint** must come **before strength**.\n\nThen the **Sovereign’s Way** is **rectified**,\n**Peaking in an era of prosperity**,\n**Establishing law for all under heaven**.\n\nHaving **received completion**#3,\n**Losing excess** yet **returning to submission**,\n**Preserving what is gained**.\n\nThen **yin** transforms with **aging change**,\n**Yang** comes with **non-conformity**,\n**Struggle** and **labor**—\nThe **subtle struggle** of **aging**.\n\nScholars translate **struggle** as *yǎn* (也),\nSong as *shì* (事).\n\n**Residence**—**attaining one’s station**;\n**Hardship**—**encountering obstruction**.\n\n**Attaining station**,\nThen **no hardship** can **prevail**.\n\n**Trust**—\nOne who **conforms to the Way** achieves **trust**,\n**Hardship**—**awaiting the time** alone.\n\n**Law**—**easily shared with all under heaven**;\n**Labor**—**toil without reward**.\n\nFrom **centrality to levelness**,\nThe **great person’s rectification**.\n\nFrom **joy to law**,\nThe **sage’s governance**.\n\n**Law** is **shared with all under heaven** alone,\nThus **easy**.\nYet if it were **not easy**,\nWho could **harmonize with all under heaven**?\n\n**Labor** follows **heaven’s Way**,\n**Exertion** without **toil**—**reward** without **suffering**.\n\n**The Way** not in its **proper time**,\n**Toil without reward**—\nThen **only cultivation** remains.\n\n**Cultivation** receives **abundant surplus**,\nThe **noble cultivates auspiciousness**,\nThe **petty cultivates malevolence**.\n\nEighty-one chapters,\nSeven hundred twenty-nine **cultivations**.\n**Matters** of **kindred**—\n**Celebration** or **calamity**—\nThis is **abundant surplus**,\nAnd **cultivation** receives it as **seed**,\n**Auspiciousness** and **malevolence** flourish.\n\n**Mystic interweaving**—\n**Centrality** begins **cyclical motion**,\n**Excess** curves **resolute uprightness**.\n\n**Fragmented** and **ornate** **ways**—\nSometimes **pure**, sometimes **variegated**.\n\n**Centrality** and **cyclical motion**—**Dao/Way and virtue**,\n**Excess** and **resolute uprightness**—**timely affairs**.\n\n**Centrality** generates **Dao/Way**,\n**Cyclical motion** returns **virtue**.\n\n**Excess**—**confused by cyclical motion**,\n**Resolute uprightness**—**guarding centrality’s exterior**.\n\n**Uprightness** produces **vigilance**,\n**Curvature** produces **ornateness**.\n\n**Strength**—**vigorous**,\n**Weakness**—**frail**.\n\nSometimes *ruǎn* (傒) has *shì* (事) above it.\n\n**Accumulation**—**many**,\n**Scarcity**—**few**.\n\n**Vision**—**to

ignorance**,\nLike **vision** amid **blindness**,\nThough sometimes **obscured**,\n**Vision** remains within.\n\nTo **make clear and bright**,\nSimply **unfurl it**.\n\n**Flourishing with surplus**,\nReverses to **scarcity**.\n\n**Frailty with weakness**,\n**Scarcity without accumulation**—\nThis is the **mask of scarcity**,\nYet **not yet departed from unity**.\n\n**Departure** leaves the **old** while **the new** approaches—\n**Learning’s support**.\n\n**Great**—**external**,\n**Contracted**—**internal**.\n\n**Advance**—**progress**,\n**Retreat**—**withdrawal**.\n\n**Joy**—**idleness and ease**#5;\nAncient *dàng* (荡) as *tì* (逖).\n\n**Labor**—**stumbling and struggling**.\n\n**Perception**—**thoughts harmonized**;\n**Exhaustion**—**thoughts strained**.\n\nSong translates **Perception** as *sī* (思) **harmonized**,\n**Exhaustion**—*sī* (思) **strained**.\n\n**Morning qi** is **sharp** and **active**,\n**Evening qi** **returns to ease** and **internal repose**.\n\nScholars translate **qi** as *xí* (席),\nLin as *xì* (夕).\n\n**Self-loathing**—**difference**;\n**Self-adornment**—**ornament**.\n\n**Difference**—**internal discord** is **evil**,\n**Ornament**—**external display** is **beauty**.\n\n**Rectification** does not **tolerate**,\nYet **Kun** is **broad and yielding**.\n\n**Increasing days** **benefit**,\n**Decreasing days** **harm**.\n\n**Submission**—**obeying orders**,\n**Rebellion**—**contradicting**.\n\n**Relaxation**—**gentleness**,\nYet **rigidity**—**unyielding**.\n\n**Rigidity** like **leather soles**,\n**Loses gentleness and harmony**.\n\n**Sound** ascends—\n**Leather soles** belong to **ascension**.\n\nHuang translates as *yǐn* ().\n\n**Levelness and ease**—**simple**,\nYet **hardship**—**obstructed and stubborn**.\n\n---\n#3: *Chéng* (成) – *Completion/fulfillment*\n#4: *Shèng ér yǒu yú* (盛而有余) – *Abundant and overflowing*\n#5: *Yì* (佚) – *Idleness/ease*; *Dì* (逖) – *Ease/comfort*\n#6: *Yì* (佚) – *Idleness/ease*; *Dì* (逖) –

**concealing** its **means**.\n\nThus **Mysterious** **stands** **distant** before **all**,\n**Vast** and **expansive**,\n**Deep** and **profound**,\n**Faint** and **vanishing**.\n\n**Harmonizing** all—**Mysterious**.\n\n**It is humanity that scatters** **it**—\n**Knocking at its gate**, **opening its doors**, **striking its keys**—\n**Only then does it respond**.\n**How much less** when it **denies**?\n\n**For those who cultivate the Mysterious**—\n**Knocking at its outer gate**, **no response**.\n**Opening its inner doors**, **no response**.\n**Striking its keys in secret**, **only

Mysterious responds to seeking**,\n**But that the utmost refinement communicates**.\n\nWhat **humans** **desire yet lack** is **virtue**;\nWhat **humans** **abhor yet possess in excess** is **vice**.\nThe **Noble One**, **strengthening what is lacking**,\n**Diminishing what is in excess**—\n**Thus approaches the Dao of the Mysterious**.\n\n**Gazing upward**, it **resides above**;\n**Gazing downward**, it **peeks below**;\n**Straining forward**, it **lies ahead**;\n**Turning back**, it **vanishes behind**.\n**Attempting to evade it is impossible**—\n**Silently attaining its place**—\n**This is the Mysterious**.\n\n**Daily strengthening virtue** while **diminishing vice**,\n**To perfect virtue and instrumentality**—\n**That is all**.\n\n**If the Mysterious**, then **await its silent accord**.\n**Approaching the Dao**,\n**What is lacking is filled and flourishes**,\n**What is in excess is removed and does not obscure**—\n**Thus entering the Mysterious’ equilibrium**.\n\n**Therefore, the Mysterious**—\n**Its use is consummate**.\n\n**Seeing and knowing**—**this is wisdom**;\n**Gazing and loving**—**this is benevolence**;\n**Judging and deciding**—**this is courage**;\n**Encompassing and applying broadly**—**this is fairness**;\n**Able to pair with all things**—**this is harmony**;\n**Unbound by attachments**—**this is sagacity**;\n**Timing and untiming**—**this is fate**.\n\n**The Void Form**—\n**The Way through which ten thousand things pass**—\n**Is called the Way**.\n\n**The Void Form**—*Zhang* and *Ding* read *xūwúxíng*,\n*Song*, *Lin*, *Xu*, and *Huang* read *xūwúxíng*.\n**The Way through which**—*Song* reads *tōng*.\n**Is called the Way**—*Song* and *Xu*, *Huang* originally include *zhī*

*yīnyuán*.\n**Principles generate clusters**—*Ding* and *Song* read *hún*.\n**Encompassing love**—**this is benevolence**.\n\n**Ranking and measuring** **appropriateness**—\n**This is righteousness**.\n\n**Upholding virtue, benevolence, and righteousness** **and applying them**—\n**This is achievement**.\n\n**Illuminating Heaven’s function**, **clarifying all things**—\n**This is Yang**.\n\n**Obscuring the Formless**, **deep beyond measure**—\n**This is Yin**.\n\n**Yang knows Yang but not Yin**,\n**Yin knows Yin but not Yang**.\n**Knowing Yin and knowing Yang**,\n**Knowing cessation and knowing action**,\n**Knowing obscurity and knowing clarity**—\n**Who but the Mysterious?**\n\n**From obscurity, unfolding all kinds**,\n**To clarity, illuminating the world**—\n**This is the Mysterious’ technique**.\n\n**From obscurity, deep and faint**,\n**To knowing Yin and knowing Yang**—\n**This is the Mysterious’ Dao**.\n\n**In the Mysterious**,\n**Seeing and knowing**,\n**Gazing and loving**,\n**Judging and deciding**,\n**Encompassing and applying broadly**,\n**Able to pair with all things**,\n**Unbound by attachments**—\n**Then timing and untiming govern the states**,\n**And one acts throughout the world**,\n**Upholding virtue, benevolence, and righteousness** **in achievement**,\n**Aligning with the August Heaven**.\n\n**Measuring it**—**this is balance**;\n**Leveling it**—**this is equilibrium**.\n\n**Making the turbid clear**, **the perilous level**—\n**Detached from sincerity**, **it must cling to deceit**;\n**Detached from deceit**, **it must cling to sincerity**.\n**Sincerity and deceit clash**—\n**Then the Dao of the Noble and the petty man is clearly distinguished**.\n\n**The Mysterious**—\n**It balances and measures**.\n\n**The high it lowers**, **the low it raises**,\n**The abundant it takes from**, **the empty it gives to**.\n**The clear it confirms**, **the doubtful it raises**.\n\n**Planning it**—**this is thought**;\n**Establishing it**—**this is action**;\n**Persuading it**—**this is eloquence**;\n**Completing it**—**this is trust**.\n\n**Speaking of the Mysterious’ rectitude**,\n**Exceeding human affairs**—**thus**.\n\n**Heaven**—\n**Vastly displaying its divine mystery**;\n**Earth**—\n**Stably displaying its clarity**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth** **fix their stations**,\n**Divine and bright qi communicate**—\n**One, two, three**.\n\n**Positions each distinct in rank**,\n**Circulating through the Nine Regions**,\n**Beginning and end continuously linked**,\n**Above and below without corners**.\n\n**Examining the patterns of Dragon and Tiger**,\n**Observing the principles of Bird and Tortoise**—\n**Applying them to governance**,\n**Striking at the *Tai*’s beginning and end**,\n**To harmonize the *Xuanji*’s order**,\n**And rectify the *Yùhéng*’s equilibrium**.\n\n**Square and round** **grinding each other**,\n**Hard and soft** **interacting**.\n\n**When full, it enters decay**,\n**When exhausted, it renews**.\n**Having substance, having emptiness**,\n**Flow and cessation without constancy**.\n\n**Speaking of the Mysterious’ alignment with the Seven Governors**,\n**To mirror Heaven and Earth**—**thus**.\n\n**Heaven and Earth established**,\n**Thus nobility and humility are ordered**.\n**The Four Seasons progress**,\n**Thus parent and child succeed**.\n**Calendars and measures are set forth**,\n**Thus ruler and subject are rightly aligned**.\n**Constant and variable intertwine**,\n**Thus all affairs are distinguished**.\n**Substance and

Way**—\n**To reveal the unseen Form**,\n**To draw the unspun thread**,\n**And connect with all kinds**.\n\n**Above, it suspends Heaven**,\n**Below, it sinks into the abyss**,\n**Fine, it enters the reeds** (秽),\n**Broad, it encompasses the *zhěn*** (轸).\n\n**Its Dao**—**obscure and deep**—\n**Fills what is full**—*Ding* and *Song* read *yāyíng*.\n\n**Preserving while perishing**,\n**Faint yet manifest**,\n**Beginning while ending**—\n**Near the Mysterious, the Mysterious draws near**;\n**Far from the Mysterious, the Mysterious withdraws**.\n\n**Like Heaven, vast and blue**,\n**Present in the east, south, west, and north**,\n**Gazing upward, none are absent**,\n**Yet when lowered, it is unseen**.\n**Does Heaven truly depart from humanity?**\n**It is humanity that departs from it**.\n\n**The Winter Solstice and the hours after midnight**—\n**Symbols of nearing the Mysterious**.\n\n**Advancing yet unexhausted**,\n**Going yet unreached**,\n**Empty yet unfilled**—\n**Thus called nearing the Mysterious**.\n\n「The Summer Solstice and the hours after midday—\n**Symbols of withdrawing from the Mysterious**.\n\nAdvancing to its utmost and then receding,\nProceeding to exhaustion and then returning,\nFilled to capacity and then diminished—\nThus called withdrawing from the Mysterious.\n\nWhen the sun turns southward, all things die;\nWhen the sun turns northward, all things live.\n\nWhen the Dipper** (斗) turns northward, all things grow **empty** (虚);\nWhen the Dipper turns southward, all things grow **full** (盈).\nThe sun’s southern turn—\n**Rightward in motion, leftward in return**;\nThe Dipper’s southern turn—\n**Leftward in motion, rightward in return**.\n\nSometimes left, sometimes right,\nSometimes death, sometimes life—\n**The Mysterious and the numinous** conspire together,\n**Heaven and Earth** thus align,\n**Heaven’s numinous** and **Earth’s spirit** (灵).\n\n**The Mysterious Dao** is such—\nThus, through human affairs and transformations of things,\nIt **harmonizes with Heaven and Earth**,\n**Unified without division**,\nAnd the Mysterious stands as its **apex** (宗).\n\nOn the Summer Solstice, the sun reaches its southernmost point at **Eastern Well** (东井);\nOn the Winter Solstice, the sun reaches its northernmost point at **The Ox Driver** (牵牛).\nThe Dipper **governs the four seasons**,\nEach establishing its own direction.\nThe sun **traverses the western sky and returns eastward**,\nThe Dipper **reaches the eastern sky and returns westward**.\n\nAll things depend upon it—\nWhen full, the signs of death appear;\nWhen empty, new life emerges.\nThe Mysterious **scatters as one yin and one yang**,\nIts **movements**—left and right—**meet in opposition**.\nThus, it **unifies the Mysterious and the numinous**,\nAnd **returns to the primal wholeness of the Mysterious**.\n\nIt is said, **\"Heaven’s numinous and Earth’s spirit\"**,\nMeaning **unified yet not chaotic**,\n**The Mysterious** **illuminates** **Heaven and Earth’s

(纬),\n**South and north as the warp** (经),\n**Warp and weft intersecting**,\n**Distinguishing perverse and orthodox** (邪正),\n**Revealing auspicious and inauspicious** (吉凶)—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\n**Digging wells** (凿井) **to draw clear water** (澹水),\n**Boring fire** (钻火) **and carving wood** (难木),\n**Melting metal and molding clay** (流金陶土),\nTo **blend the Five Refined

**measure yin**,\n**Odd and even** **pushed and performed**,\nTo **calculate all under Heaven**—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\n**Six beginnings** (六始) **as the laws** (律),\n**Six intervals** (六间) **as the harmonics** (吕),\nWhen **laws and harmonics** are **coordinated**,\nThe **twelve** are **tuned**,\nAnd **daytime and nighttime** are **measured**—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\n**The Eighty-One Divisions** (八十一所) **of the states and families**,\n**Marked as lower, middle, and upper**,\nTo **represent the Four Seas**—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\n**One division** (一辟),\n**Three ministers** (三公),\n**Nine officials** (九卿),\n**Twenty-seven great officers** (二十七大夫),\n**Eighty-one elemental officials** (八十一元士)—\n**Few govern the many**,\n**None govern the nonexistent**—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\nIn ancient times, **there were no thunder sacrifices** (不霆) **nor divinations** (不虞),\n(In some texts, *lèi* is read *yú* instead of *pèi*—\nSound: *yú*, others read *lèi*.)\n**Slowing their contemplations** (慎其思虑),\n**Not relying on fortune-telling or augury** (匪筮匪卜),\nWhen **auspicious and inauspicious** **intermingled**,\nThe **sages** then **crafted the Yarrow Stalk and tortoise shell**,\n**Piercing the essence** (钻精) **and leaning upon the spirit** (倚神),\n**Clasping knowledge** (箝知) **of rest and auspice** (休咎)—\nThe Mysterious Dao **illuminates** it.\n\nThus, to **know what is unknowable**,\nOne **approximates it through the trigrams and hexagrams** (卦兆),\nTo **fathom depths and trace distances**,\nOne **seeks it through contemplation** (思虑).\nOf these two, which **establishes the essence**?\nThe **essence** in **fortune-telling and divination**,\n**The spirit moves its

is guarded**,\n**None can seize it**.\nThus, to **unravel the tangled threads** (抽天下之蔓蔓)\nAnd **dispel the chaotic mixtures** (散天下之混混)\nUnder Heaven—\nWho but the **essence** could accomplish this?\n\n**Illuminating from self-measurement** (莹自度数),\n**Radiant in all methods** (晖於诸法),\nAnd **chiefly relying on the utmost precision** (至精者),\nIt **returns to the One**.\n\nThe **observers**,\n**Value adherence to natural patterns** (循) **and embodying spontaneity** (体自然).\nWhen their **adherence is vast**,\nThen their **embodiment is robust** (壮);\nWhen their **adherence is slight**,\nThen their **embodiment is meager** (瘠).\nWhen their **adherence is straight**,\nThen their **embodiment is complete** (浑);\nWhen their **adherence is crooked**,\nThen their **embodiment is scattered** (散).\nThus, they **do not fear what they possess**,\nNor **force what they lack**.\nLike the **body itself**,\n**Adding causes excess** (赘),\n**Removing causes deficiency** (亏).\nThus, **substance is guided by nature** (质斡),\n**Embellishment by human affairs** (华藻)—\nCan it be **augmented or diminished**?\n\n(The original reads: *\"华藻在乎人事也，其可损益与？\"*\nSome texts omit *人事*, reading instead: *\"华藻其作其字\"*—\nThe **allowance** and **yellowing** **are as they are**.)\n\nThe **One** is **used to trace beginnings** (摹始)\nAnd **measure depths** (测深),\nThe **three threes** (三三) **to exhaust endings** (尽终)\nAnd **reach the utmost heights** (极崇),\nThe **two twos** (二二) **to align affairs** (参事)\nAnd **grasp the central way** (要中).\n**Human affairs mirror this**,\n**Dedicating to its work** (务其事)\n**Not its words** (不务其辞),\n**Multiplying its changes** (多其变)\n**Not its forms** (不多其文).\n\n**Without coordination**, its **intentions are unclear** (其指不详),\n**Without centrality**, its **responses are narrow** (其应不博),\n**Without completeness**, its **work is confined** (其事不散),\n**Without depth**, its **meaning is unseen** (其意不见).\nThus, **forms reveal the substance** (文以见乎质),\n**Words reveal the emotions** (辞以睹乎情).\nBy **observing its application of words**,\nOne **sees what its heart desires**.\n\nSuch are the **words of the Mysterious Dao**.\n**Exalting the Nine

(三三).\n\n**One-One** is the **beginning**; **Three-Three**, the **apex**; **Two-Two**, the **center**.\nThis is the **unalterable natural measure**—\na model for **divination’s calculations**.\n\nThe **Dao** has **roots and continuity**, **transformation and change**.\nFollowing roots and continuity—**harmony with the Dao’s spirit**;\nTransforming and changing—**adapting to the times**.\nThus, **rooted yet transformative**, the **Heavenly Dao is realized**;\n**Transformative yet rooted**, the **Heavenly Dao is tamed**.\n\nThings **do not arise without roots**, nor **fulfill without transformation**.\nThus, **knowing roots but not transformation**, things **lose their standard**;\n**Knowing transformation but not roots**, things **lose their balance**.\nTransformation **untimely**, things **lose their foundation**;\nRoots **unprincipled**, things **lose their order**.\n\n**Rooting and transforming**—\nthe **measures of statecraft**.\nThe **movement of measures**—\nthe **effects of success and failure**.\n\n**Adaptability**—\nthe **mysteries of the Dao**.\n\nRoots **mirror water and wood**,\nTransformation **mirrors metal and fire**.\n\nEstablishing

called.\n\n**Yin and Yang**—**uniting their distinctions**;\n**Compliance and Resistance**—**weaving the threads**;\n**Obscurity and Clarity**—**discriminating their essence**.\n\nYin without Yang—**no union in application**;\nThreads without weaves—**no fulfillment in meaning**;\nClarity without Obscurity—**no distinction in virtue**.\n\n**Yin and Yang**—**to draw forth emotions**;\n**Compliance and Resistance**—**to refine principles**;\n**Obscurity and Clarity**—**to illuminate affairs**.\n\n**Drawing emotions**—**the refined Dao**;\n**Refining principles**—**the illuminated conduct**;\n**Illuminating affairs**—**the path of the virtuous**.\n\n**Opening to its name**—\nthe **mysteries’ speech**.\n\nFrom the **center as Yang**, encircling as **Yin**,\nto **extreme the eighty-one heads**.\n\nNine positions at the **center**,\nthreads and weaves intersecting—\nthings **manifest their meaning** as they encounter time.\n\n**Obscurity and Clarity**—\nthe **matters of day and night**.\n\n**Coming and going**, **permeating**—\nentering the **Gate of Loss**.\n\n**What is gained and what is lost**—\n**gaining blessings, losing calamities**.\n\nHeaven and Earth:\n**Blessings align**, calamities **reverse**;\nMountains and rivers:\n**Blessings settle low**, calamities **rise high**;\nHuman conduct:\n**Blessings are upright**, calamities **are perverse**.\n\nThus, the **virtuous**—\n**internally upright, externally tamed**,\n**always yielding to others**—\ntherefore **their actions gain blessings and avoid calamities**.\n\nBlessings **do not arise from ugliness**,\ncalamities **do not persist from goodness**.\n**Ugliness and goodness**—\nthe **virtuous thus clearly distinguish**.\n\nBlessings **end in joy**, calamities **begin in sorrow**.\nWhat Heaven and Earth **value** is called **blessing**;\nwhat **ghosts and spirits** **favor** is called **blessing**;\nwhat **human conduct** **delights in** is called **blessing**;\nwhat they **despise and abhor**—all are called **calamity**.\n\nThus, the **more one despises blessings**, the **greater the calamity**.\nThe **calamities of daytime** are few—**pure in clarity**;\nthe **calamities of night** are many—**pure in obscurity**.\nThose **scattered between day and night**—\ntheir **calamities and blessings mix**,\nfor they are **neither purely obscure nor purely clear**.\n\n**Refining to illuminate affairs**—\nto make people **know the return of calamities and blessings**.\n\n---\n**太玄数卷第八 玄数**\n\n**Kunlun**—**Heaven and Earth’s birthplace**—**produces the stalks**,\n**three sacred essences** **refined**—**to number**.\n\nDispersing the **mysterious in three layers** to establish **families**,\n**comparing the Two Principles** to **perceive affairs**.\n\n**Encounters and unions**—\n**naming their patterns** and **extending their command**.\n\n**Precision**—**the threads of doubt**—**its substance revealed**.\n**The Oracle says**: *\"Assume the Great Mysteries\"*.\n\n**Assuming the Great Mysteries**—**truth and sincerity**,\n**doubting the substance**—**divine and spirit-like**.\n\n**Rest**—**encountering Yang**, stars and times **align in speech**;\n**Blame**—**encountering Yin**, stars and times **contradict in speech**.\n\n**Divination has its Dao**:\n**Without precision, do not divinate**,\n**without doubt, do not divinate**,\n**without order, do not divinate**,\n**without its omens, do not divinate as if divining**.\n\n**Divine brilliance**—**soaring beyond** (three characters repeated).\n**Thirty-six**—**the stalks are viewed**.\n\nHeaven **divides by three**, completing **six**—\nthus **eighteen stalks**.\n\nHeaven **does not act alone**, Earth **does not complete alone**—\n**doubling their roots**, Earth **lacks three** to **match Heaven’s eighteen**.\n\n**Separate one** and hang it **on the left small finger**,\n**dividing the rest in half**.\n\nWith three stalks gathered, the remainder is grouped under **艻** [same as *扐*].\nAfter one **艻**, recount the rest in sevens—seven as one, eight as two, nine as three—\nthus six counts exhaust the **stalks’ Dao**.\n\n**Encountering** has **lower, middle, upper**:\nLower is **thought**,\nMiddle is **fortune**,\nUpper is **calamity**.\nThought, fortune, and calamity each have lower, middle, upper—\nby day and night, their **rest and blame** are distinguished.\n\nHeaven divides by three, thus one, two, three **weave into six**.\nMultiply six by three to make **eighteen**.\nHeaven acts, Earth completes it—\nthus doubled, they form **thirty-six**.\nThis is the **divine brilliance**—**soaring beyond** (three characters repeated).\n\nEarth lacks three to match Heaven’s eighteen—\nthus the stalks use **thirty-three**.\n\nThe **Mysterious Divination** hangs one stalk—**most precise**;\ndividing and gathering three times—**most variable**;\ngrouping the remainder under **艻**—**returning to the odd**.\n\nAfter one **艻**, recounting the rest yields seven, eight, or nine—\nthus day’s one, two, three.\n\nHeaven completes six, so six counts exhaust the **stalks’ Dao**—\nnumbers reach their limit, symbols find their fullness.\n\nObtain **direction**, seek **province**, obtain **department**, seek **house**—\nthis is **dispersing the obscure through three layers** and establishing **house**—**fourfold**.\n\nExtreme one becomes two, extreme two becomes three, extreme three becomes **推** [*tuī*],\n**推** three becomes **嬴赞** [*yíngzàn*].\n*Chapter, Xu*, and *Ding* variants read **推** three as **赢赞**—\n*嬴* or *赢* are interchangeable.\n*赞嬴* enters **表**, *表嬴* enters **家**, *家嬴* enters **部**, *部嬴* enters **州**, *州嬴* enters **方**.\n*Fàn Zhǔ* notes: *玄* may be *去* [omitted].\n*Lù Yún* says: Should read *玄*.\nNow all versions read *玄*, except *Sòng* as *去*, *Chapter* as *入玄*.\nNumbers arise from *玄*, extend to extremes, then return to *玄*.\nThis is how the Sage harmonizes the people’s **fortune and calamity**,\nwashing the heart in secrecy—\nthus interspersed within the **divination method**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Yú** divided the nine provinces,\nassigned tributes by soil, and bestowed upon **Yáo** the **black jade tablet**,\ndeclaring his success—\nsymbolizing this very principle.\n\n**One follows, two follow, three follow**—**Great Rest**.\n**One follows, two follow, three contradict**—\nbeginning and middle **Rest**, ending in **blame**.\n**One follows, two contradict, three contradict**—\nbeginning **Rest**, middle and end **blame**.\n**One contradicts, two follow, three follow**—\nbeginning **blame**, middle and end **Rest**.\n**One contradicts, two contradict, three follow**—\nbeginning and middle **blame**, ending in **Rest**.\n**One contradicts, two contradict, three contradict**—**Great Blame**.\n\nDivination has four aspects: **stars, times, numbers, speech**.\nMorning uses **classics**, evening uses **weft**.\nObserve beginning and middle, decide by the end.\nDay signifies **Rest**, night signifies **blame**.\nAnd by **stars, times, numbers, speech**—\nharmony or contradiction,盛衰—\ntheir categories align to determine the matter.\n\nMorning uses **classics**: one, five, seven;\nEvening uses **weft**: three, four, eight;\nMorning and evening combined: two **classics**, one **weft**, using two, six, nine—\nthis is the **three tables**.\nMorning symbolizes **Heaven**, evening **Earth**, the middle **Human**.\n\nOne, five, six advance to **seven**,\nThree, four, seven advance to **eight**,\nTwo, six, eight advance to **nine**.\nObserving beginning and middle, deciding by the end—\nexamining accumulated extremes and grasping their changes.\n\nThus the remaining **艻** numbers:\nOne portends **seven**, three portends **eight**, two portends **nine**.\n\nDivination may yield **ending Rest but reversing blame**,\nor **ending blame but reversing Rest**—\nit depends on carefully observing the questioned matter,\ncross-referencing with **stars, times, numbers**.\n\nIf not a matter of **loyalty and sincerity**, fortune may shift to misfortune—\nthis is the **divination law**.\n\n**Three eights** are **Wood**, the **East**, **Spring**.\nDays: **Jia, Yi**; hours: **Yín, Mǎo**.\nSound: **Jué (角)**, color: **green**, taste: **sour**, odor: **rancid**, form: **bent and trustworthy**.\nGenerates **Fire**, overcomes **Earth**.\nSeasonally generates, stores in the **spleen**.\nThe **lung** extends upward to cover the **kidney**,\ndescends low to conceal the **heart**,\nresides centrally to

the **lung**,\nCentral (autumn?) sacrifices to the **heart**, autumn to the **liver**,\nWinter to the **kidney**—\nthis is the **Mysterious Correspondence**.\n\nThus the **lung** stores **qi**—**Fire**;\nthe **kidney** stores **essence**—**Water**;\nthe **heart** stores **spirit**—**Earth**;\nthe **spleen** stores **thought**—**Wood**;\nthe **liver** stores **blood**—**Metal**.\n\nAs

the **perfectly unified** remain undivided.\n\n**Nature** is **benevolence**, **emotion** is **joy**.\n**Affairs** appear **proper**, **conduct** is **reverent**,\n**solemn**, **austere**, **drought**.\n*The Hong Fan* records:\n*\"Rain and drought follow weft,\nheat and cold, wind follow classics.\"*\n\n**Mysterious numbers** classify by their **true names** alone—\nnot by **clashing

pushed to their utmost, they **zhèn** (震) and transform into **léi** (雷)—thunder,\ninto **gǔ** (鼓)—drums,\ninto **huīshēng** (恢声)—resounding echoes.\n\nTheir emergence marks **xīn** (新)—novelty,\ntheir obstruction yields **zào** (躁)—restlessness.\nThe grand becomes **hù** (户)—door, and exits,\nthe small becomes **yǒu** (牖)—window, and flows through.\nAll things:\nto exit, they must pass through **hù** (户),\nto enter, they must pass through **mén** (门).\n**Hù** (户) is **odd** (奇),\n**mén** (门) is **even** (偶).\n\nThe **zào** (灶) stove and **tì** (惕) hearth nurture by **liú**

(流).\nThus, this **fú** (福)—blessing is gathered,\nand the family master presides over it.\n\nWhen doors and stoves open and close in change,\nthis is **wéi** (纬)—the **subtle, responsive** (纬) principle;\nwhen the stove’s circulation and central hearth maintain constancy,\nthis is **jīng** (经)—the **fundamental, enduring** (经) principle.\n\nTherefore, *The Yueling* (月令) states:\n*\"In

(衢),\n**gatherings** (会),\n**metropolises** (都).\n\nIt is **measurement** (度),\n**scale** (量).\n\nIt is **earthworks** (土工),\n**bows and arrows** (弓矢).\n\n**Chariots** (舆) **carry** (载) with **rectitude** (方),\n**axles** (毂) **operate centrally** (中运).\n\nIt is **cultivation** (稼),\n**parsimony** (啬).\n\nIt is **food** (食),\n**giving** (与).\n\nIt is **coffins** (棺),\n**lids** (椟), symbolizing **Earth’s bearing and movement** (象地载之运).\n\nThe *Book of Documents* (《书》) says:\n*\"Earth **cultivates** (爰稼) **grain and harvests** (穑).*\n**Food** (食) **realizes itself** (以自实),\nand **nourishes life** (腴其生),\nthus **death** (死) arises.\n**Coffins** (棺) are what **humans return to Earth** (人之所以及於土) with.\n\nAll **hundreds of transformations** (百昌) **emerge from Earth** (生於土),\nand **return to Earth** (反於土),\nso that **life’s return to its origin** (生之生於本) is like **lids** (椟).\n\n**Life and death** (死生) **cycle endlessly** (往复),\nlike **crossroads** (衢).\n**Crossroads** (衢) are **pathways of convergence** (会通).\n\nFour **directions** (达) converge,\nand the **center** (中) is their **metropolis** (都).\n**Measurement** (度) and **scale** (量) are **meticulously applied** (法谨),\nand **earthworks** (土工) **depend on it** (资之).\n\n**Governance** (治) of a **state** (国) reaches **bows and arrows** (弓矢)—\nthis is the **ultimate** (极).\n\nThus it is said:\n*\"The **movement of the Five Weapons** (五兵之运) is the **end of virtue** (德之末).\"*\n\nThe **sprouting of things** (物之萌生),\n**separating from concealment** (离潜),\n**emerging and hiding** (发伏),\nis like the **arrows of a

says **dazzling blindness** (牟) should be **blindness** (瞀).\n\n**Evil** (妖) does not **arise on its own** (不自兴),\nit comes from **humans reversing virtue** (由人反德).\n\n**Foolishness** (愚) is a

Phases** (五行)\nallows one to **discuss the Dao** (论道),\nto **establish rites** (制礼)—\nnot merely to **revere their divinations** (特尚其占).\n\nWhen the **Five Phases** (五行) **take effect** (用事), **kingship** (王) arises,\nand **kingship** (王) **generates mutual relations** (所生相).\nThus when **kingship** (王) **declines** (废),\nthe **one who overcomes kingship** (胜王) **is imprisoned** (囚),\nand the **one kingship overcomes** (王所胜) **dies** (死).\n\nIn **sound** (声),\n**Gong** (宫) is the **Sovereign** (君),\n**Zheng** (征) is **affairs** (事),\n**Shang** (商) is the **minister** (相),\n**Jue** (角)

**eight**.\n\nThus, it **harmonizes the two extremes** (统和二极) and **narrates the eight winds** (述行八风).\n\nFrom **Zi** (子) to **Si** (巳) are all **yang cycles** (阳纪);\n**Great Reeds** (大吕), **Intercalary Bell** (夹钟), and **Middle Reeds** (中吕) are the **yin tones within yang** (阳中之阴声).\n\nFrom **Wu** (午) to **Hai** (亥) are all **yin cycles** (阴纪);\n**Rui Bin** (蕤宾), **Southern Reeds** (南吕), and **Responding Bell** (应钟) are the **yang tones within yin** (阴中之阳声).\n\nThus, from **Zi** to **Si**, all are **generated downward** (下生);\nFrom **Wu** to **Hai**, all are **generated upward** (上生).\n\nIn music, if **Huangzhong** (黄钟) is the **gong** (宫), then **Linzhong** (林钟) is the **zheng** (征), **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **shang** (商), **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **yu** (羽), and **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **jiao** (角);\n\nIf **Linzhong** (林钟) is the **gong** (宫), then **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **zheng** (征), **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **shang** (商), **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **yu** (羽), and **Yingzhong** (应钟) is the **jiao** (角);\n\nIf **Taicuo** (太簇) is the **gong** (宫), then **Nanlu** (南吕) is the **zheng** (征), **Goushi** (姑洗) is the **shang** (商), **Yingzhong** (应钟) is the **yu** (羽), and **Ruibin** (蕤宾) is the **jiao** (角).\n\nIn all, the **five tones** (五声) and **six lü twelve pipes** (六律十二管) **cyclically become the gong** (旋相为宫).\n\nBy **three transformations** (三变通), this is what is recorded as **\"spreading the Five Phases across the Four Seasons, harmonizing to then give birth to the months\"** (播五行於四时，和而后月生).\n\nThe **Five Phases** (五行) **alternately reign** (更王用事), one **rectifies and conquers** (一正胜), and **harmonizes with generation** (而参以生和), this is what the *Yijing* calls **\"the nature and disposition of what is beneficial and upright\"** (利贞之性情).\n\nThe numbers of **Zi and Wu** (子午) are **nine**, **Chou and Wei** (丑未) are **eight**, **Yin and Shen** (寅申) are **seven**, **Mao and You** (卯酉) are **six**, **Chen and Xu** (辰戌) are **five**, **Si and Hai** (巳亥) are **four**.\n\nThus, there are **forty-two lü** (律四十二), and **thirty-six lü** (吕三十六).\n\nCombining the numbers of **lü and lü**, some **return** (或还) and some **do not** (或否), totaling **seventy-eight** (凡七十有八), and the number of **Huangzhong** (黄钟) is established.\n\nAll these are **derived from Huangzhong** (皆生黄钟).\n\n**Zi and Wu** (子午) are the **Celestial and Earthly** means of **establishing the Supreme Pole** (天地之所以经皇极), and the number **nine** (九数) is **fulfilled** (缊焉).\n\nYet their **decline reaches Si and Hai** (杀至于巳亥), and the **lü** (律) **integrates the numbers of Zi, Wu, Yin, Shen, Chen, and Xu** (综子午寅申辰戌之数) to make **forty-two**, while the **lü** (吕) **integrates the numbers of Chou, Wei, Mao, You, Si, and Hai** (综丑未卯酉巳亥之数) to make **thirty-six**.\n\nCombined, they total **seventy-eight** (凡七十有八).\n\nYet the numbers of **lü and lü**, **Huangzhong alone returns to nine** (黄钟独还得九), while the others do not.\n\nThus, **Huangzhong is the master of lü and lü** (黄钟为律吕之宗).\n\nThe number of **Huangzhong** is **eighty-one** (黄钟之数八十有一), yet it is **established at seventy-eight** (而立於七十有八).\n\nThus, **three are left void** (虚其三), as the **mystery of all wonders** (以为众妙之玄).\n\nThe reason for using **nine** (所以用九者也) is to **triple three** (参三焉), and the **twelve zodiacal branches** (十有二辰) stop at **four**, thus **establishing the square** (则以立方而已矣).\n\nAll these **measurements derive from Huangzhong** (皆由黄钟者).\n\nFrom the **breadth of ninety grains** (九十黍之广) **length is generated**, and from the **pipe of nine inches** (九寸之管) **measure is generated**.\n\nFrom its **weight of one thousand two hundred grains** (一千二百黍之重) as **twelve zhu** (十二铢), **weights and measures are generated** (而生权衡也).\n\nThe numbers of **Jia and Si** (甲巳) are **nine**#1, **Yi and Geng** (乙庚) are **eight**, **Bing and Xin** (丙辛) are **seven**, **Ding and Ren** (丁壬) are **six**, **Wu and Gui** (戊癸) are **five**.\n\n**Tones are generated from the days** (声生於日), **lü from the zodiacal branches** (律生於辰).\n\n**Tones are straight by nature and quality** (声以情质), **lü are narrated by harmony and sound** (律以和声).\n\nWhen **tone and lü accord**, the **eight kinds of sound are born** (声律相协，而八音生).\n\nThe **Celestial numbers are five**, the **Earthly numbers are five**, and the **five positions** (五位) **mutually attain harmony**, each having its **resonance** (各有合), thus the **ten days** (十日) are as such.\n\n**Celestial and Earthly sincerity** (天地中孚) is **manifested in Jiazi** (象见甲子).\n\n**Jia** is the **first origin** (一元也).\n\nOne becomes **three**, three becomes **nine**, and the numbers are **exhausted** (而数究焉).\n\nThus, the number of **Jia** is **nine**, and the number of **Ji** is also **nine**#2, following their **harmony** (从其合也).\n\nThe number of **Jia** is **nine**, descending to **Yi**, **Bing**, **Ding**, and **Wu**;\n\nThe number of **Ji** is **nine**#3, descending to **Geng**, **Xin**, **Ren**, and **Gui**.\n\nThe numbers **reach their limit at five**, thus the **days govern by their cycles** (是故日以冲运也).\n\n**Jia and Yi** (甲乙) are **jiao** (角), **Bing and Ding** (丙丁) are **zheng** (征), **Geng and Xin** (庚辛) are **shang** (商), **Ren and Gui** (壬癸) are **yu** (羽), **Wu and Ji** (戊己) are **gong** (宫)#4.\n\nThus, **tones are generated from the days** (声生於日), the **qi of Heaven** (天之气);\n\n**Lü are generated from the zodiacal branches** (律生於辰), the **law of Earth** (地之法).\n\n**Tones are rectified by nature and quality** (声直之以情质), **lü are narrated by harmony and sound** (律述之以和声).\n\nThus, the sounds of **metal, stone, silk, bamboo, gourd, leather, and wood** (金石丝竹匏土革木) are born, and **tone can be harmonized to form culture** (声可和而成文).\n\nThis is because **each day has its resonance** (凡以日各有合故也).\n\nThe **Nine Heavens** (九天):\nOne is **Central Heaven** (中天), two is **Excess Heaven** (羡天), three is **Following Heaven** (从天), four is **Changing Heaven** (更天), five is **Blinking Heaven** (睟天), six is **Boundless Heaven** (廓天), seven is **Reduced Heaven** (减天), eight is **Sunken Heaven** (沈天), nine is **Completed Heaven** (成天).\n\nThe **Nine Earths** (九地):\nOne is **sandy mud** (沙泥), two is **marshes and pools** (泽池), three is **shallow cliffs** (沚崖), four is **lower fields** (下田), five is **middle fields** (中田), six is **upper fields** (上田), seven is **lower mountains** (下山), eight is **middle mountains** (中山), nine is **upper mountains** (上山).\n\nThe **Nine People** (九人):\nOne is **lowly person** (下人), two is **common person** (平人), three is **ascending person** (进人), four is **low fortune** (下禄), five is **middle fortune** (中禄), six is **high fortune** (上禄), seven is **lost aspiration** (失志), eight is **sick and stagnant** (疾淤), **Song reads as stagnant-sick** (宋作淤疾), nine is **extreme** (极).\n\nThe **Nine Movements** (九行) are by **action**, according to **beginning, middle, and end** (据始、中、终);\n\nThe **Nine Earths** are by **position**, according to **lower, middle, and upper** (据下、中、上);\n\nThe **Nine People** are by **observation of motion**, according to **thought, fortune, and calamity** (据思、福、祸).\n\nThe **Nine Bodies** (九体):\nOne is **hands and feet** (手足), two is **arms and legs** (臂胫), three is **thighs and arms** (股肱), four is **vital points** (要), five is **abdomen** (腹), six is **shoulders** (肩), seven is **[missing/obscure]** (，，，，音呀); **[*Zhushu Jijie* reads as *kū*, Song reads as *hú*]** (，《释文》音枯，宋音胡), eight is **face** (面), nine is **forehead** (颡).\n\nThe **Nine Affinities** (九属):\nOne is **great-grandchild** (玄孙), two is **great-great-grandchild** (曾孙), three is **great-great-great-grandchild** (仍孙), four is **child** (子), five is **self** (身), six is **father** (父), seven is **grandfather** (祖父), eight is **great-grandfather** (曾祖父), nine is **highest ancestor** (高祖父).\n\nThe **Nine Orifices** (九窍):\nOne and six are **front** (前), **ears** (耳);\nTwo and seven are **eyes** (目);\nThree and eight are **nose** (鼻);\nFour and nine are **mouth** (口);\nFive and five are **back** (后).\n\nThe **Nine Manifestations** (九体) and **Nine Affinities** (九属) reveal the count of solar terms (日辰之数). The descending sequence from the **Nine Differences** (九差) is indeed the natural order.\n\nThe **Nine Sequences** (九序):\nOne is **First of First** (孟孟),\nTwo is **First of Middle** (孟仲),\nThree is **First of Last** (孟季),\nFour is **Middle of First** (仲孟),\nFive is **Middle of Middle** (仲仲),\nSix is **Middle of Last** (仲季),\nSeven is **Last of First** (季孟),\nEight is **Last of Middle** (季仲),\nNine is **Last of Last** (季季).\n\nThe **Nine Matters** (九事):\nOne is **Establishing Framework** (规模),\nTwo is **Rectification and Obstruction** (方沮),\nThree is **Natural Adaptation** (自如),\nFour is **External Diversion** (外它),\nFive is **Internal Harmony** (中和),\nSix is **Abundance and Excess** (盛多),\nSeven is **Decline** (消),\nEight is **Exhaustion** (耗),\nNine is **Final Defect** (尽弊).\n\nThe **Nine Years** (九年):\nOne is **ten years** (一十),\nTwo is **twenty years** (二十),\nThree is **thirty years** (三十),\nFour is **forty years** (四十),\nFive is **fifty years** (五十),\nSix is **sixty years** (六十),\nSeven is **seventy years** (七十),\nEight is **eighty years** (八十),\nNine is **ninety years** (九十).\n\nThe **Nine Affinities** govern the **Nine Manifestations** and **Nine Orifices** (九窍), for the **Manifestations** and **Orifices** are the foundation upon which human **Affinities** are established. The **Nine Matters** govern the **Nine Sequences** and **Nine Years**, for the **Sequences** and **Years** are the means by which human **Matters** are conducted.\n\nThe **Sequences** advance in cycles of three years, completing ten.\n\nThe **Mysterious Calculations** (玄算) for divination:\n**Family** (家), one is placed as one, two as two, three as three;\n**Division** (部), one does not increase, two increase by three, three increase by six;\n**State** (州), one does not increase, two increase by nine, three increase by eighteen;\n**Direction** (方), one does not increase, two increase by twenty-seven, three increase by fifty-four.\n\n*The Law of Speech (法言)* states:\n*The Book of Changes (易)*, a work of numbers, can be counted. What can be counted is also what is complete. The *Book of Documents (书)* lacks more than half its content, yet scholars unfamiliar with it cannot grasp its essence, for there are no numerical principles to establish its categories and forms. The **Mysterious Calculations** allow the diviner to know the order of the **First Praises** (首赞) concerning the day and stars, thus maintaining the celestial order (经天) and human relationships (彝伦) without confusion.\n\nIf one obtains a **Direction**, a **State**, a **Division**, and three **Families** in divination, then the **Family** is placed as three, and the **Direction**, **State**, and **Division** are all without increase, totaling three. This is the order of the **First Praise** (玄首之次), three in count. All increases are derived from the initial **Family** numbers.\n\nTo seek the **Praise of Manifestation** (表之赞), place the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtract the **Great Beginning** (太始) divination count, reduce by one and multiply by nine, then add the **Praise**. Subtract half of the **Mysterious Name** count, and one obtains the **Praise** subtracted from the Winter Solstice count.\n\nEven is the night of the obtained day, odd is the day of the obtained day. Xu (许) and Huang (黄) read this as *ming* (明), Song (宋) and Guo (郭) read it as *dé* (得).\n\nPlacing the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtracting the **Great Beginning** count and reducing by one means subtracting the first **Praise** of the placed **Mysterious Name**. Multiplying by nine means each **Praise** is counted nine times. Subtracting the first **Praise** of the **Mysterious Name**, one then calculates the **Praise** to be added. One **Praise** increases by one, two by two, three by three.\n\nTo seek the day, subtract the **Mysterious Name** count from the **Praise**, then halve it: two **Praises** make one day, hence an even **Praise** is the night, and an odd **Praise** is the day.\n\nIf divination yields a response, from the center to the response, totaling forty-one, then place forty-one, reduce by one and multiply by nine, resulting in three hundred sixty. Add the obtained **Praise**, subtract half of three hundred sixty, and one obtains one hundred eighty, which is the count subtracted from the Winter Solstice.\n\nIncrease by one to get three hundred sixty-one, an odd **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the day. Increase by two to get three hundred sixty-two, an even **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the night.\n\nTo seek the star, begin with **The Ox of the Net** (牵牛). When the **Mysterious Calculations** are exhausted, that is the day. From the Winter Solstice, **The Ox of the Net** moves one degree per day, completing one degree per day.\n\nThus, when the star degrees are exhausted, one obtains the degree where the day resides.\n\nEnd of *The Great Mysterious Calculations* (太玄数) Volume Eight.\n#1 Original text: 『己』 changed to 『乙』 according to Fan’s edition.\n#2#3#4 Original text: 『己』 changed to 『巳』 according to the correct Heavenly Stems (天干) in the main text.\n*Great Mysterious Calculations* (太玄文) Volume Nine, *Mysterious Calculations* (玄文).\n\nThe **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. The **Vague** is the north, winter, where form has not yet emerged. The **Direct** is the east, spring, where substance exists but lacks adornment. The **Covered** is the south, summer, where things grow long and may all be grasped and worn. *Xu* and *Huang* read it as **Load** (载), *Zhang* and *Ding* as **Wear** (戴), *Guo* as **Wear** (戴).\n\nThe **Mature** is the west, autumn, where all things take shape and are completed. When form exists, it returns to the formless, hence the **Dark**. Therefore, all things are **Vague** in the north, **Direct** in the east, **Covered** in the south, **Mature** in the west, and **Dark** in the north.\n\nThus, the **Vague** is the dwelling of the **Having**; the **Direct**, the foundation of **Adornment**; the **Covered**, the master of **Decay**; the **Mature**, the repository of **Life**; and the **Dark**, the storehouse of **Illumination**.\n\nThe **Vague** shelters its **Qi**; the **Direct** encounters its kind. The **Covered** reaches its peak in growth; the **Mature** examines its completion. *Fan* notes: \"Examine things to make them fully realized.\" The main text reads **Close** (亲), but this is an error by the copyist. *Song* and *Guo* read it as **Completion** (就). The **Dark** reflects its depths.\n\nThe **Vague** and **Covered** reach extremes; the **Direct** and **Mature** admonish each other. Emerging from the **Dark** and returning to the **Dark**, the new and the old alternate. *Zhang* reads it as **Loan** (贷).\n\nYin and Yang succeed one another; clarity and turbidity intermingle. Those who advance are promoted; those who succeed are retired. When used, they are **debased**; when timely, they are **noble**. The celestial patterns and earthly substances remain unaltered in their positions.\n\nThe **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. From the **Vague** come speech, action, and blessings or calamities. In the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed.\n\nAction leaves a trace; speech has sound; blessings bring **Strength** (膊). *Yin* **Shàn** (剸) means \"to cut flesh\"; also read as *Yin* **Shùnguǎn** (竖衮). Calamities manifest in form—this is the **Direct**.\n\nIf there is the **Direct**, one may be **Covered**; if **Covered**, one may reach **Maturity**; if **Mature**, one returns to the **Dark**. Therefore, in the **Vague**’s time, all may be regulated—thus the eighty-one schools arise from the **Vague**.\n\nThe heavens shine brilliantly from the **boundless** (无畛). *Yin* **Xuàn** (炫) is read as *Hu* **Yàn** (胡绚). The **radiant** (熿熿) emerges from the **limitless** (无垠). *Yin* **Guāng** (熿) is read as *Hù* **Guāng** (户光), the same as **Resplendent** (煌).\n\nThus, in the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven conceals itself in **depth**, stirs to **reveal**, exalts to **overlook**, regulates to **restrain**, and concludes in **obscurity**. Its depths are unfathomable; its brilliance is boundless.\n\nHence, the sage hides in **depth** to properly honor the spirits, stirs to **reveal** to inspire the people, shines brightly to **encompass** and illuminate, regulates to **restrain** to make all tremble—*Yin* **Nǐlì** (牛力) or *Yin* **Nǐ** (拟)—and conceals in **obscurity** to remain hidden.\n\nThe sage who embodies these five aspects is thus called the **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**.\n\nSomeone asks: Why does *Kunlun* **Pāngbó** (昆仑旁薄) relate to **obscurity** (幽)?\n\nIt is said: The sage, like the heavens and earth, contemplates and encompasses all things. Within *Kunlun*, form has not yet manifested externally; dwelling alone in joy, pondering alone in sorrow—joy is unbearable, sorrow is insurmountable—hence it is called **obscurity**.\n\nWhy does the spirit contend in the **mysterious** (玄)?\n\nIt is said: The petty person’s heart is mixed, seeking to manifest externally, and uses Yin and Yang to contend over auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Yang contends over auspiciousness; Yin contends over inauspiciousness.\n\nThe wind reveals the tiger; the clouds reveal the dragon. The sage acts, and all things harmonize. The dragon emerges from within—why is this so?\n\nIt is said: The dragon is where **virtue/power** (德) first takes form. If Yin does not reach its extreme, Yang does not arise; if chaos does not reach its extreme, **virtue/power** (德) does not manifest.\n\nThe sage cultivates **virtue/power** (德) to await the time, neither acting before its due nor lagging behind. When movement and stillness are subtly discerned, without losing their principles—who but the sage can do this?\n\nThus, the beginning and end may be used as **ordinary** (庸).\n\nThe *Kù* is empty with no cause—greatly receiving life and fate—why is this so?\n\nIt is said: The petty person cannot embrace emptiness or dwell in lowliness; they are **level and common** (庳), yet cannot be **overlooked**. Empty yet able to be **filled**, lacking yet able to **have**, relying on causes to **act**—thus they greatly receive life and fate without **avoidance** (辟), hence the *Kù* is **obscured** (否).

withholds its embrace,\nyet shines brighter in the West—\nwhy is this so?\n\nIt is said: The petty person is **full and overflowing**.\nThose who **self-destroy** from emptiness—\nwater **fades** into

(*qiú*)[^3] **enclose** the **true** (*zhēn*)?\nIt is said: **Ren** (*rén*) abhors **non-ren**,\n**proper conduct** (*yì*) abhors **non-conduct**.\nThe Sage’s **generosity** suffices to **nourish the many**,\nhis **harmony and softness** suffice to **settle all things**.\nHeaven and Earth contain all things—\nwhat cannot be contained by Heaven and Earth\nis only the **un-ren** and **un-conduct**.\n\nThus, water **encloses the true**.\n\nYellow not yellow—\nwhy is this so?\n\nIt is said: The petty person **loses the central norm**.\nAll **ones** mark the **beginning**—\nall

or **substance and excess (实饶)**—\n**Nurturing (息)** and **diminishing (消)** are intertwined,\nNobility (贵) and lowliness (贱) are exchanged.\n\nFortune arrives while misfortune departs;\nMisfortune arrives while fortune flees.\n\n**Xu (许)** and **Huang (黄)** omit the line *\"Fortune arrives...\"*.\n**Song (宋)** and **Ding (丁)** place *\"Misfortune arrives...\"* above.\n\nHere, we follow the

night—**divergence (衍)**.\n\n**Song (宋)** states: *\"Daytime counts are high, nighttime counts are low.\"*\n**Symbol (象)** observes the Moon’s waxing and the Sun’s waning.\n\nWhen the **Noble (君子)** acts with radiance and the **Petty (小人)** acts in obscurity,\nThe **Dao/Way (道)** of the **Noble (君子)** is complete,\nWhile the **Dao/Way (道)** of the **Petty (小人)** is lacking.\n\nTo **begin (始)** with the **Three (三)** is structured—**position (位)** is thus established.\nTo **generate (生)** with the **Three (三)** is boundless—**Qi (气)** thus creates and transforms.\n\nThe **Three (三)** divide **Yang Qi (阳气)** into **beginning (始), middle (中), and end (终)**.\nThe **Nine Heavens (九天)** revolve in cycles—\n**Beginning (始)** at the **first day of the eleventh month (十一月朔旦)**, the **Winter Solstice (冬至)**,\nWhile the **middle (中)** aligns with it.\n\nAfter **forty-five days (四十日半)**, the **Great Cold (大寒)**, then **Xian (羡)** aligns with it.\nAgain after **forty-five days (四十日半)**, **Awakening of Insects (惊蛰)**, then **Cong (从)** aligns with it.\nThen **Grain Rain (谷雨)**, **Xiao (賥)** aligns with it;\n**Lesser Fullness (小满)**, **Kuo (廓)** aligns with it;\n**Lesser Heat (小暑)**, **Jian (减)** aligns with it;\n**Dewey Heat (处暑)**, **Chen (沈)** aligns with it;\n**Autumnal Equinox (秋分)**, **Cheng (成)** aligns with it;\n**Established Winter (立冬)**, completing the **Qi (气)** of the cycle.\n\nThe **Nine Heavens (九天)** total **three hundred sixty-four and a half days (日)**, and thus the year is fulfilled.\n\nWhen the **day (日)** advances **forty-five days (四十日)**, its halves diverge—**this is how Heaven’s revolutions (运)** occur.\n\n**Three (三)** are divided into **four (四)**, reaching **eighty-one (八十一)**;\n**Nine (九)** are arranged in **three (三) and six (六)**, reaching **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)**.\n\nThus, from **beginning (始), middle (中), and end (终)**,\nTo **contemplate (思), fortune (福), and misfortune (祸)**,\nTo exhaust the **calculations of Yin and Yang (阴阳消息之计)**.\n\n**Profound (玄)** encompasses **three hundred sixty-four nights (夜)** and **three hundred sixty-five days (昼)**,\nThis is **daytime counts high, nighttime counts low—Yang in excess, Yin in depletion (阳饶而阴乏)**.\n\n**One (一)** and **Six (六)** share the same **root (宗)**;\n**Two (二)** and **Seven (七)** are **companions (朋)**;\n**Three (三)** and **Eight (八)** form **harmony (友)**;\n**Four (四)** and **Nine (九)** follow the same **Dao/Way (道)**;\n**Five (五)** guards itself with **Five (五)**.\n\n**Profound (玄)** has **one ruler (规), one measure (矩), one cord (绳), one standard (准)**,\nTo conform to the **crossing Dao/Way (横天地之道)**,\nTo tame the **numbers of Yin and Yang (阴阳之数)**,\nTo emulate their **numinous brilliance (神明)**,\nTo illuminate their **profound darkness (幽昏)**.\n\nThen the **Dao/Way (道)** of the **eight directions (八方)** can be discerned.\n\n**Three (三)** and **Eight (八)** form the **ruler (规)**;\n**Four (四)** and **Nine (九)** form the **measure (矩)**;\n**Two (二)** and **Seven (七)** form the **cord (绳)**;\n**One (一)** and **Six (六)** form the **standard (准)**.\n\nWith **boundaries (界)** distinguished and **corners (辨)** divided,\nThe **Dao/Way (道)** of the **eight directions (八方)** can be discerned.\n\n**Profound (玄)** has the **number of Six Nine (六九)**,\n**Strategy (策)** uses **Three Six (三六)**,\n**Ceremony (仪)** uses **Two Nine (二九)**.\n**Profound (玄)** employs **eighteen (十有八)** in its calculations!\n\nThe **essence of Tai (泰积)** begins with **eighteen strategies (十有八策)**,\nEnds with **fifty-four (五十有四)**.\n\nCombining the **beginning (始)** and **end (终)** strategies,\nHalf of it is **Tai’s center (泰中)**.\n\nThe **strategies of Tai’s center (泰中)** are **thirty-six (三十有六)**,\nUsed to govern **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)**,\nTotaling **twenty-six thousand two hundred forty-four strategies (策)** for the **Tai cycle (泰积)**.\n\n**Seventy-two strategies (策)** make one day,\nTotaling **three hundred sixty-four and a half days (日)**,\nFilling the **year (岁)** and aligning with its **days (日)** while governing the **calendar (历)**.\n\nThus, from **Child (子)** to **Chen (辰)**,\nFrom **Chen (辰)** to **Shen (申)**,\nFrom **Shen (申)** to **Child (子)**, crowned with **Jia (甲)**,\nAnd **Zhou (章), Hui (会), Tong (统), Yuan (元)** all vanish together with **eclipses (月食)**—this is the **Profound Dao/Way (玄之道)**.\n\n**Ding (丁)** and **Song (宋)** state: *\"Vanish with eclipses (月食没), the fullness of the **Profound Dao/Way (玄道)**.\"*\n**Zhou (章)** states: *\"Vanish with **moon’s occultation (月蚀)**—this is the fullness of the **Profound Dao/Way (玄之道)**.\"*\n\nHeaven uses **Six (六)** as **nodes (节)**—**Yin within Yang (阳中之阴)**.\nEarth uses **Nine (九)** to **govern gatherings (制会)**—**Yang within Yin (阴中之阳)**.\n**Yin and Yang (阴阳)** transform and interact—**thus utility and life (利用生)** arise.\n\n**Strategy (策)** mirrors **Heaven’s numbers (天数)**,\nEarth **conforms (仪)** to Heaven and **matches (匹)** it,\nHumans **observe the law (法)** therein.\n\nThus, its numbers begin with **eighteen strategies (十有八策)**,\nEnd with **fifty-four (五十有四)**.\n\nThe **numbers of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (天地人数)**,\n**Begin and end (始终)** in alignment,\nAnd **Profound (玄)** takes **eighteen strategies (十有八)** as its **root (宗)**.\n\nThus, combining **fifty-four (五十有四)** to make **seventy-two (七十有二)**,\nThis is the **strategy (策)** of one **day (日)** and one **night (夜)**.\n\nAnd one **year (岁)** mirrors this,\nSo **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十九)** are governed by **Tai’s center (泰中)** at **thirty-six (三十有六)**.\n\nEach **cycle (赞)** has **thirty-six strategies (策)**,\nAccumulating to **twenty-six thousand two hundred forty-four strategies (策)** to complete the year.\n\n**Zhou (章), Xian (羡), Cong (从)** from **Child (子)** to **Chen (辰)**,\n**Geng (更), Meng (睟), Kuo (廓)** from **Chen (辰)** to **Shen (申)**,\n**Jian (减), Chen (沈), Cheng (成)** from **Shen (申)** to **Child (子)**—\nThese are the **four phases (方)** of one year.\n\nAnd **four thousand six hundred seventeen years (岁)** mirror this pattern.\n\n**Nineteen years (十九岁)** form one **Zhou (章)**,\n**Twenty-seven chapters (二十七章)** form one **Hui (会)**,\n**Three gatherings (三会)** form one **Tong (统)**,\n**Three cycles (三统)** form one **Yuan (元)**.\n\n**Tong (统)** totals **one thousand five hundred thirty-nine years (岁)**,\n**Jiazi (甲子)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Heaven’s cycle (天统)**,\n**Jiachen (甲辰)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Earth’s cycle (地统)**,\n**Jia Shen (甲申)** on the **first day of the Winter Solstice (朔旦冬至)** as **Human’s cycle (人统)**—\nMirroring the **Profound (玄)**’s **three phases (三方)**.\n\nWhen eclipses vanish together with the moon, the **Tong (统)** encompasses **eighty-one chapters (章)**, the **Yuan (元)** encompasses **nine gatherings (会)**, and each gathering exhausts the count of lunar eclipses.\n\nLunar eclipses are the **fullness of numbers (数之盈)**.\nLu Ji (陆绩) said: *\"Divide the total of one **Yuan (元)** by nine gatherings, and it will be fully exhausted.\"*\n\nWhen the **intercalary division (闰分)** of one **chapter (章)** is complete, when the lunar eclipses of one **gathering (会)** are exhausted, when the **new moon divisions (朔分)** of one **Tong (统)** are complete, and when the **six Jia (六甲)** of one **Yuan (元)** are fulfilled—\n\nThe **Profound (玄)** reveals:\nThe **Profound (玄)** generates **two divine forms (神象二)**,\nThe **two divine forms** generate **the standard (规)**,\nThe **standard** generates **three models (三摹)**,\nThe **three models** generate **nine foundations (九据)**.\n\nThe **Profound (玄)** refines once and attains **Heaven (天)**, hence it is called **Nine Heavens (九天)**.\n*(Later editions read \"nine\" instead of \"have.\" Earth and Human follow the same.)*\nRefined twice, it attains **Earth (地)**, hence it is called **Nine Earths (九地)**.\nRefined thrice, it attains **Human (人)**, hence it is called **Nine Humans (九人)**.\n\nHeaven completes in **three foundations (三据)**, hence it is called **Beginning, Middle, End (始、中、终)**.\nEarth takes form in **three foundations**, hence it is called **Below, Middle, Above (下、中、上)**.\nHuman manifests in **three foundations**, hence it is called **Thought, Fortune, Calamity (思、福、祸)**.\n\n*\"Below inhales, above exhales\"*—**hūhéqiè (呼合切)**, as in *\"yìn (歠)\"* in the *Shuōwén (说文)*.\nIt traverses the **Nine Voids (九虚)**;\nThrough **small and great threads (小索大索)**, it revolves **nine degrees (九度)**.\n\nThe **Profound (玄)** is the **leader of the divine (神之魁)**.\nHeaven’s **Profound (玄)** is unseen,\nEarth’s **Profound (玄)** is formless,\nHuman’s **Profound (玄)** is the **heart and abdomen**.\n\nHeaven’s **mystic orifice (奥)** is the **west-north (西北)**, where **dense transformations refine essence (郁化精)**.\nEarth’s **mystic orifice** is **Huángquán (黄泉)**—*(later editions read \"Huángyuān (黄渊)\")*—\nThis is the **hidden soul and glory (隐魄荣)**.\nHuman’s **mystic orifice** is **thought and deliberation (思虑)**, containing the **ultimate essence (至精)**.\n*(Later editions read \"合 (harmony)\" instead of \"含 (contain)\")*.\n\nHeaven’s **vault (穹)** is arched and encircles below,\nEarth’s **flanks (旁薄)** lean upward,\nHuman **dwells (处)** in between.\n*(Later editions read \"苠 (jì)\" instead of the obscured character.)*\n\nHeaven is **pure and unrestrained (浑)**, hence its motion is ceaseless.\nEarth is **decayed and still (颓而静)**, hence its generation is not delayed.\nHuman is **tamed by Heaven and Earth (驯乎天地)**, hence its actions are inexhaustible.\n\nHeaven and Earth oppose each other,\nThe sun and moon **intersect (相刿)**,\nMountains and rivers **flow toward each other (相流)**,\nLight and heavy **float in balance (相浮)**,\nYin and yang **weave (相绩)**,\nSuperior and inferior **do not transgress (不相黩)**.\n\nThus, Earth is **hollowed (坎)** while Heaven is **stern (严)**,\nThe moon **hurries (遄)** while the sun **lingers (湛)**.\n\nThe **Five Phases** alternately reign,\nThe **Four Seasons** never peak together.\nThe sun **shines brightly (昱)** in the day,\nThe moon **shines brightly (昱)** in the night;\n**Mǎo (昴)** ascends in winter,\n**Fire** ascends in summer.\n\nSouth and north **fix their positions (定位)**,\nEast and west **communicate qi (通气)**,\nAll things **intertwine within (错离)**.\n\nThe **Profound (玄)** manifests **one virtue (一德)** and generates **Five Births (五生)**,\nIt manifests **one punishment (一刑)** and generates **Five Subductions (五克)**.\n*(Later editions include \"玄\" before \"一刑.\")*\n\nThe **Five Births** do not **exhaust each other (不相殄)**,\nThe **Five Subductions** do not **contradict each other (不相逆)**.\nNot exhausting allows **succession (相继)**,\nNot contradicting allows **governance (相治)**.\nSuccession is the **Way of parent and child (父子之道)**,\nGovernance is the **treasure of ruler and subject (君臣之宝)**.\n\nFrom the **Profound Darkness (玄冥)**, **divine light (神光)** emerges,\nHence the **two divine forms (神象二)**.\nThe **two movements (二运)** are boundless,\nThus the **standard (规)** is generated.\nThe **standard** is **modeled threefold (三摹)**,\nAnd **Heaven’s Profound (天玄)**, **Earth’s Profound (地玄)**, and **Human’s Profound (人玄)** are attained.\n\nA **model (摹)** must have **foundations (据)** to establish itself,\nHence the **nine foundations (九据)** extend to **seven hundred twenty-nine (七百二十有九)**.\n\nThe **nine praises (九赞)** are the **three ultimate Ways (三极之道)**.\n\nHeaven’s **mystic orifice (奥)** in the west-north\nRefines **hidden essence (化精)** in the **chaotic void (混沌无端)**.\nEarth’s **mystic orifice** in **Huángquán (黄泉)**\nEnsures **nothing is absent within (信无不在乎中)**,\nWhere **all things’ refined qi (精气)** hides.\nThis is the **hidden soul and glory (魄荣)**, the **time of obscurity (罔之时)**.\n\nWhat is called **\"conceal Heaven to become Heaven (潜天而天)\"**,\n**\"conceal Earth to become Earth (潜地而地)\"**—\nThis is the **ultimate of these orifices (极此奥)**.\n\nThe **Profound (玄)** is thus manifested,\nYet humans seek to **craft it (造之)**.\nIf not abandoning **material things (遗物)** and **separating from humanity (离人)**,\nAnd if **refined thought (精思)** does not **transcend (超诣)**,\nThen none can enter.\n\n**Suǒ (摛)** said:\n*\"To defy is impossible, silence attains its essence (默则得其所).\"*\nThis is the **Profound essence (玄要)**.\n\nWhen the **Profound (玄)** is attained, **divine clarity (神明)** generates it,\nThen **all changes of motion and stillness (动静之变)** are **Profound affairs (玄事)**;\n**Rest and calamity, beauty and ugliness (休咎好丑)** are all **Profound laws (玄法)**.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth **open and close (阖辟)**,\nAll things **arise together (并兴)**,\nYet the **Profound remains unmoved (玄不动)**.\nIf **carved and etched (若雕若刻)**,\n**Generations transform endlessly (生生化化)**,\nYet the **Profound does nothing (玄无为)**.\nTo **analyze desires and guide wisdom (析愿迪哲)**,\nTo **command deceit and destroy depravity (诏奸陨慝)**,\nTo **organize all measures (百度厘举)**—\nYet the **Profound does not resist (玄莫违)**.\n\nFrom **beginning to end (始终)**, they **intertwine (相纠)**,\nFrom **ancient to present (古今)**, they **oscillate (相荡)**,\nThe **Tong and Yuan are endless (统元无尽)**,\nYet the **Profound does not pass (玄不逝)**.\n\nIs this not what is said:\n*\"All things are complete within me,\nThe Dao-heart is only subtle (道心惟微)?\"*\n\nThe **Non-dual (不二)** is the **constant of the Profound (玄之常)**;\nThe **dual (凡二)** is the **variation of the divine (神之变)**.\n\nThe **Profound** records the **\"Book of the Dipper (斗书)\"**—*(later editions read \"Profound Dipper Book (玄日斗书)\")*—\nYet the moon is not recorded,\nAlways **full (常满)**, to **counter the void (以御虚)**.\n*(Later editions include \"日 (sun)\" before \"常满.\")*\n\nWhen a year is **complete and serene (宁悉)**, the **season is diseased (年病)**.\nIn **nineteen years (十九年)**, there are **seven intercalations (七闰)**—\nThis is **Heaven’s compensation (天之偿)**.\n\nYang **moves and exhales (动吐)**,\nYin **stills and inhales (静翕)**;\nThe **Way of Yang is always abundant (阳道常饶)**,\nThe **Way of Yin is always deficient (阴道常乏)**—\nThis is the **Way of Yin and Yang (阴阳之道)**.\n*(Later editions read \"阳动而吐，阴静而翕.\")*\n\nWhen Heaven is **strong and healthy (强健)**, it **soars high (侨躆)**—\n*\"Sōu (侨)\"* is pronounced *\"qú xiāo (渠消)\"* (high),\nOr it may be read as *\"luó (蹻)\"* (reside outside), *\"jū biǎo (居表)\"*.\n*\"Dù (躆)\"* is pronounced *\"jù (据)\"*.\n\nA day and night **self-renew with surplus (自复而有余)**.\nThe sun has **south and north (南有北)**,\nThe moon has **forward and return (往有来)**.\nIf the sun **neither goes south nor north (不南不北)**,\nThen there is **no winter nor summer (无冬无夏)**;\nIf the moon **neither goes forward nor returns (不往不来)**,\nThen the **full and new moons do not form (望晦不成)**.\n\nThe **Sage observes** the **variations of hidden and revealed (脁朒侧匿)**—\n*\"Zhuì (脁)\"* is pronounced *\"chù liǎo (敕了)\"*.\n*(Later editions omit \"朒,\" reading only \"脁.\")*\nAnd **regulates the sequence of solar and lunar gender (日月雌雄之序)**,\nEstablishing it **without end (经之於无已)**.\n\nThus, the **Profound** **weaves the celestial threads (鸿纶天元)**,\n**Binding (娄)** and **restraining (钳)** what is to come—\n*(Later editions read \"拙将来者乎\" instead of \"钳之.\")*\n*\"Hù (乎)\"* may also be read as *\"yě (也)\"*.\n\n**Three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter

(入於嗣岁)**.\n\n「The so-called *intercalary month* (**閏**, *rùn*) is the accumulation of this *oddity* (**奇**, *qí*).\n\nWhen the movement does not reach the **full measure of Heaven’s degrees** (**天度**, *tiāndù*), then this year is **deficient** (**病**, *bìng*).\nTherefore, an **intercalary month** is added to compensate for it.\nIn **nineteen years**, seven **intercalary months** (**七閏**, *qī rùn*) are applied,\nAnd thus the **year is made complete** (**岁宁悉**, *suì níngxī*).\n\nThe **Profound Dao** (**玄经**, *Xuánjīng*) mirrors the **year’s progression** (**岁**, *suì*), hence it is said:\n*\"Eighty-one chapters\"* (**八十一首**, *bāshíyī shǒu*), and all **matters of the year are perfected** (**岁事咸贞**, *suìshì xiánzhēng*).\nWhen **completeness is without deficiency** (**宁无不安**, *níng wú bù’ān*) and **perfection is without excess** (**悉无不足**, *xī wú bùzú*), this is the **fulfillment of the canon** (**章之成**, *zhāng zhī chéng*).\n\n*\"Zhuì\"* (**脁**, *zhuì*) refers to the **Moon’s swift movement** (**月行疾**, *yuè xíngjí*);\n*\"Nǎi\"* (**朒**, *nǎi*) refers to the **Moon’s slow movement** (**月行迟**, *yuè xíngchí*).\nWhen the **waning phase is visible in the west**, it is called *\"Zhuì\"* (**晦见于西谓之脁**, *huì jiàn yú xī wèi zhī zhuì*);\nWhen the **new moon is visible in the east**, it is called *\"Nǎi\"* (**朔见于东谓之朒**, *shuò jiàn yú dōng wèi zhī nǎi*).\n\n*\"Sè\"* (**侧**, *sè*) and *\"Nì\"* (**匿**, *nì*) refer to **deviations from its proper course** (**失正行**, *shī zhèngxíng*).\nWhen **the Great is without bounds** (**大无方**, *Dà wúfāng*) and **the Easy is without fixed times** (**易无时**, *Yì wúshí*), then **it becomes the realm of spirits and ghosts** (**神鬼**, *shén guǐ*).\n*(Later editions read \"大无方无时，然后为鬼神\" instead of \"大无方，易无时，然后为神鬼也,\" omitting the \"也\" and treating \"神鬼\" as \"鬼神.\")*\n\nThe **Divine** **concludes at the Six Canons** (**神终乎六宗**, *shén zhōng hū liù zōng*).\n*(Later editions: \"游\" [yóu] for \"宗\"; \"斿\" [zhuì] in Huang’s text—likely an ancient variant.)*\n**The vital essence animates all things** (**魂魂万物**, *hún hún wànwù*), ever **moving and surging** (**动而常冲**, *dòng ér cháng chōng*).\n\nThus, the **Profound Dao’s discourse** (**玄之辞**, *Xuán zhī cí*) is:\n**Deep** to **plumb the depths** (**沉以穷乎下**, *chén yǐ qióng hū xià*);\n**Light** to **reach the heights** (**浮以际乎上**, *fú yǐ jì hū shàng*);\n**Curve** to **attain straightness** (**曲而端**, *qū ér duān*);\n**Scatter** yet **to gather** (**散而聚**, *sàn ér jù*).\nIts **greatness** is not **fully tasted** (**美也不尽於味**, *měi yě bù jìn yú wèi*);\nIts **magnitude** is not **exhausted in its expanse** (**大也不尽其汇**, *dà yě bù jìn qí huì*).\n\n**Above and below are interconnected** (**上连下连**, *shàng lián xià lián*), yet **not confined to one direction** (**非一方也**, *fēi yī fāng yě*).\n**Near and far have no fixed measure** (**远近无常**, *yuǎn jìn wú cháng*), proceeding **according to kind** (**以类行也**, *yǐ lèi xíng yě*).\nSometimes **abundant**, sometimes **sparse** (**或多或寡**, *huò duō huò guǎ*), yet all **affairs are adapted to clarity** (**事适乎明也**, *shì shì hū míng yě*).\n\nThus, those who speak well of **Heaven and Earth** use **human affairs** (**善言天地者以人事**, *shàn yán tiāndì zhě yǐ rénshì*);\nThose who speak well of **human affairs** use **Heaven and Earth** (**善言人事以天地**, *shàn yán rénshì yǐ tiāndì*).\n\n**Full and new moons** **alternate in succession** (**明晦相推**, *mínghuì xiāng tuī*), while **Sun and Moon** **progress beyond measure** (**而日月逾迈**, *ér rìyuè yú mài*).\n**Year after year** **swells in resonance** (**岁岁相荡**, *suìsuì xiāng dàng*), and **Heaven and Earth** **are ever more nurtured** (**而天地弥陶**, *ér tiāndì mí táo*).\n\nThis is what is meant by **the Divine and the Bright are inexhaustible** (**之谓神明不穷**, *zhī wèi shén míng bù qióng*).\nThe **root origin** is **difficult to follow** (**原本者难由**, *yuánběn zhě nányóu*);\nThe **later branches** are **easy to conform to** (**流末者易从**, *liú mò zhě yì cóng*).\n\nThus, those who uphold the **Six Canons** are praised for **filial piety** (**有宗祖者则称乎孝**, *yǒu zōngzǔ zhě zé chēng hū xiào*);\nThose who order **sovereign and minister** are praised for **loyalty** (**序君臣者则称乎忠**, *xù junchén zhě zé chēng hū zhōng*).\nThis is the **true proclamation of the Great Instruction** (**实告大训**, *shí gào dà xùn*).\n\nThe **Profound Dao’s discourse** is **to exhaust the Divine** (**玄之辞以尽神而已**, *Xuán zhī cí yǐ jìn shén ér yǐ*).\nThe **Divine generates loyalty and filial piety** (**玄神生忠孝**, *Xuán shén shēng zhōngxiào*);\n**Loyalty and filial piety generate benevolence and righteousness** (**忠孝生仁义**, *zhōngxiào shēng rén yì*).\n\nWho would not **practice benevolence** (**孰不为仁**, *shú bù wéi rén*)?\nWho would not **embrace righteousness** (**孰不为义**, *shú bù wéi yì*)?\n\n「Thus, its foundation is such that it can remain undiluted. When the **Dao of day and night** (*zhòuyè zhī dào*) is unclear, the affairs of **the Junzi** (*君子*) and **the petty person** (*小人*) become intertwined, then those called **benevolent** (*rén*) may fail to distinguish three times out of ten, and those called **righteous** (*yì*) may enter into what is not righteous without discernment. This would cause conduct to lose its **pure virtue** (*chún dé*), which is not the **true order of Heaven’s command** (*tiān mìng zhī zhèng*).\n\nThe **Profound Dao** (*Xuán*) proclaims the **Great Instruction** (*dà xùn*), and thus **correctness prevails** (*zhèng shèng yǐ*).\n\nThe **Eleven Chapters** (*Yòu shíyī piān*) are elucidated with the *Exegesis* (*Shìwén*), sourced from Xu Han’s *Phonetic Examination* (*Yīnkǎo*). The **Wang** refers to **Tang Wang Yi** (*王即唐王涯*); the **Chen** refers to **modern Chen Jian** (*陈即近世陈渐*), who compiled *The Performance of the Profound* (*Yǎn Xuán*); the **Wu** refers to **Wu Bi** (*吴秘*), who authored *Phonetic Meanings* (*Yīnyì*); the **Guo** refers to **Guo Yuanheng** (*郭元亨*), who composed *Commentary* (*Shū*); the **Ding** refers to **Ding Wei** (*丁谓*), the **Xu** to **Xu Ang** (*许昂*), the **Zhang** to **Zhang Cha** (*章察*), the **Huang** to **Huang Boshi** (*黄伯思*), and the **Lin** to **Lin Yu**’s edition (*林瑀本*), as stated.\n\nThe **Great Profound** (*Tài Xuán*) aligns with the **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*). In the **Tài Chū Upper Yuan** (*Tài Chū Shàng Yuán*), the **first month of the first year (Jiazi)** (*正月甲子*), on the **new moon and winter solstice** (*shuò dàn dōng zhì*), there is no excess fraction. After **1,539 years** (*hòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*), in the year **Jiachen** (*甲辰*), the new moon and winter solstice again align without excess. Another **1,539 years** (*yòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*) returns to the **Jiazi** alignment, without excess.\n\n**Nineteen years** (*shí jiǔ suì*) constitute **one chapter** (*yī zhāng*), and **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*) amount to **513 years** (*wǔ bǎi yī shí sān suì*), forming **one cycle** (*yī huì*). A **cycle** (*huì*) is the completion of the **interaction of sun and moon** (*rìyuè jiāohuì*).\n\n**Eighty-one chapters** (*bā shí yī zhāng*)—**1,539 years** (*qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*)—form **one grand cycle** (*yī tǒng*). From **Zi** (*子*) to **Chen** (*辰*), from **Chen** (*辰*) to **Shen** (*申*), and from **Shen** (*申*) back to **Zi** (*子*), these **four grand cycles** (*fàn sì yīuàn*) span **4,617 years** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí yī qiān suì*).\n\nEach **grand cycle** (*tǒng*) contains **three cycles** (*sān huì*), each **cycle** (*huì*) comprises **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*), and **nine cycles** (*jiǔ huì*) complete **one grand cycle** (*yī yuàn*). Within this, **one chapter** exhausts its **intercalary fraction** (*rùn fèn*), **one cycle** completes its **eclipses** (*yuè shí*), **one grand cycle** fulfills its **new moon divisions** (*shuò fèn*), and **one grand cycle** aligns the **six celestial stems** (*liù jiǎ*) and **ten heavenly branches** (*shí zhī*).\n\nThe **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*) uses **81** as the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*), with **365 days** (*sān bǎi liù shí wǔ rì*) per year. Multiplying the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*) yields **29,565 fractions** (*èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi liù shí wǔ fèn*), adding **one-fourth of a day** (*yì sì fèn rì zhī yī*), resulting in **20 fractions short** (*èr shí fèn shǎo*), totaling **29,585 fractions short** (*hé èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi bā shí wǔ fèn shǎo*). Dividing by the **twenty-four solar terms** (*èr shí sì qì*), each term receives **1,232 fractions** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn*), with **17 fractions short** (*yú shí qī fèn shǎo*) remaining.\n\nMultiplying by **32** (*sān shí èr*) and **8** (*bā*), the common denominator yields **552** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí èr*). Further division yields **23 seconds** (*èr shí sān miǎo*). Thus, each **solar term** (*qì*) contains **1,232 fractions and 23 seconds** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn èr shí sān miǎo*).\n\nUsing **32** (*sān shí èr*) as the **second-mother** (*miǎo mǔ*), each **verse** (*shǒu*) receives **364 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sān bǎi liù shí sì fèn shí liù miǎo*), and each **ode** (*zàn*) receives **40 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sì shí fèn shí liù miǎo*).\n\nTo determine the **solar term** (*qì*) in which an **ode** (*zàn*) falls: place the **winter solstice** (*dōng zhì*) **solar term**’s fractions and seconds, then subtract the fractions and seconds of the **verse** (*shǒu*). If the remainder is less than the **verse** (*shǒu*), subtract the fractions and seconds of the **ode** (*zàn*). The remaining fractions and seconds, when calculated, yield **Lesser Cold** (*xiǎo hán*).\n\nFor the next **solar term** (*qì*), place the remaining fractions and seconds of the previous term, add the fractions and seconds of the current term, and seek as before.

I fear that future generations will treat it like an overturned jar of fermented soybeans. Xiong laughed but did not respond.\n\nSome scholars criticized this, saying that since Xiong was not a sage, his composing a classic was like the rulers of Wu and Chu in the Spring and Autumn period, who usurped the title of king—an offense deserving of extermination. Gu preserved these words, and though his intent surpassed that of Xin, he did not acknowledge the *Taixuan Jing* as being as excellent as Yangzi claimed.\n\nI too privately wondered why Yangzi did not endorse the *Yijing* but instead created the *Taixuan Jing*. The *Yijing* exhaustively encompasses the principles of Heaven and humanity. How could Yangzi surpass it, yet compose another book? Moreover, I did not know its purpose, so I also did not believe Yangzi was suited to author the *Taixuan Jing*.\n\nLater, as I studied the *Yijing*, I found its profundity and obscurity difficult to grasp. I thought the *Taixuan Jing* must be a work by a virtuous scholar—simpler in meaning and easier in text than the *Yijing*. Those who ascend the Jiao Mountains must first traverse the lowlands; those who journey to the distant seas must first follow the Yangtze and Han rivers. Thus, I wished to begin with the *Taixuan Jing*, gradually progressing to the *Yijing*, hoping to attain even a distant glimpse of its depths.\n\nAfter years of seeking, I finally obtained a copy. At first, its meaning was murky and indistinct, barely comprehensible. I then devoted myself to careful study, excluding all distractions, and read it dozens of times, comparing its beginning and end, gradually discerning its general outline. Then, sighing deeply, I placed the book down and exclaimed: Ah! Was Yangzi truly a great scholar?",

      "translated_text": "After Confucius’ passing, who else could have known the Dao of the Sage if not Yangzi? Mencius and Xunzi are hardly worthy of comparison, let alone the rest. The *Taixuan Jing* reveals the manifest as it reaches humanity and the profound as it exhausts the divine; it encompasses the vast as it embraces the cosmos, and delves into the minute as it enters hair and thread. It unifies the Dao of Heaven, Earth, and humanity into one, scraping away at its roots to reveal its origin, nurturing all things as their primal mother. Like the earth bearing weight without sinking, like the sea yielding water without depletion. Though there may be those who practice the Dao in the world, none can surpass this in ease.\n\nExamining it from the undifferentiated origin, the *Taixuan* was already born. Observing it in the present, the *Taixuan* is not without effect. Pursuing it to the end of Heaven and Earth, the *Taixuan* cannot be extinguished. Questioning it with the nature of all things reveals no gaps; probing it with the forms of spirits and gods finds no contradiction; aligning it with the Six Classics shows no inconsistency. Even if the Sage were to return, upon seeing the *Taixuan*, he would surely smile with delight, deeming it the fulfillment of his own heart.\n\nThus, it is clear that the *Taixuan* serves to complement the *Yijing*—not as a separate work competing with it. How shallow He Qin and Gu Xi knew it, yet how profound their misjudgment!\n\nSome say: *\"The principles of the Yijing differ from those of the Taixuan. Yangzi did not follow the Yijing but created his own system. How then does the Taixuan complement the Yijing?\"*\n\nMoreover, if the Taixuan shares the same Dao as the Yijing, then why have the Yijing at all? Why the Taixuan?\n\nI reply: The hunter’s tools serve to capture game—whether by net or by arrow, what difference does it make? Books serve to convey the Dao: the Yijing is the net, the Taixuan is the arrow. What harm is there?\n\nIf one rejects the arrow to rely solely on the net, your pursuit of the Dao will be stifled. Besides, Yangzi composed the *Fayan* to align with the *Analects*; he wrote the *Taixuan* to align with the *Yijing*. If you abandon the *Fayan* yet wish to discard the *Taixuan*, are you not confused?\n\nThe Dao of the *Fayan* and the *Analects*—do they truly differ? The relationship between the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing* is the same.\n\nWhen a great hall is about to collapse, one beam may prop it up, but nothing secures it like many beams. When the Great Dao is about to fade, one book may clarify it, but nothing illuminates it like many books. If a scholar can devote himself entirely to the *Yijing*, that is indeed sufficient. Yet the *Yijing* is Heaven itself, and the *Taixuan* is its ladder. Would you ascend to Heaven and abandon its ladder?\n\nEarlier scholars have expounded the *Taixuan*, and their interpretations are numerous. Yet Yangzi’s writing is rich in exegesis, pointing toward depths so profound that the *Taixuan* itself is the most difficult to grasp. Thus, I doubt whether earlier scholars fully captured Yangzi’s intent. The world must have those who can truly comprehend it—I shall study it until old age.\n\n---\n\n**On the *Taixuan* and the *Yijing*:**\nAt their core, the *Yijing* and the *Taixuan* share the same Dao but differ in method.\n\nThe *Yijing* employs two symbols: Yang and Yin.\nThe *Taixuan* employs three: One, Two, and Three.\n\nThe *Yijing* has six ranks; the *Taixuan* has four tiers:\nThe highest is called *Fang* (方), followed by *Zhou* (州), then *Bu* (部), and finally *Jia* (家).\nThis is what the *Benzhuan* refers to as \"threefold modeling and fourfold division,\" culminating in eighty-one.\n\nThe *Yijing* combines eight trigrams to form sixty-four hexagrams.\nThe *Taixuan* arranges One, Two, and Three across *Fang*, *Zhou*, *Bu*, and *Jia* to produce eighty-one chapters.\n\nEach *Jia* chapter shifts with every variation—three chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Zhou* (周), and *Lian* (礥).\nEach *Bu* shifts every three chapters—nine chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (闲), and *Shang* (上).\nEach *Zhou* shifts every nine chapters—twenty-seven chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Xian* (羡), and *Cong* (从).\nEach *Fang* shifts every twenty-seven chapters—eighty-one chapters return to the initial state, as in *Zhong* (中), *Geng* (更), and *Jian* (减).\n\nBeyond eighty-one chapters, no further addition is possible—thus, it is called the Dao of Nature.\n\nThe *Yijing* has six lines per hexagram, totaling three hundred eighty-four lines.\nThe *Taixuan* has nine *zan* (赞) per chapter, totaling seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*.\n\nThe Diagram states: *\"The Taixuan has two Dào—one arising from Three, one generated by Three.*\n*The Three that arise: Fang, Zhou, Bu, Jia.*\n*The Three that generate: the threefold division of yang-qi, forming three layers, culminating in nine camps.*\n*This is the same origin but separate manifestation—the fundamental pattern of Heaven and Earth.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The *Ben Chuan* states: *\"The雄潭 contemplates the revolving Heaven, modeling it in threefold divisions and quartering it, culminating at eighty-one—this refers to the *Taixuan* chapters. Again, it says: 'Lateral divisions of threefold modeling and nine foundations, culminating at seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*—this refers to the *Taixuan zan*.' Chapters are akin to hexagrams, while *zan* are akin to lines.\n\nAgain, it says: 'Those who observe the *Yijing* name the hexagrams they see; those who observe the *Taixuan* count its strokes to determine it.' The *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are not hexagrams but numerical patterns. Thus, the *Yijing*’s six lines per hexagram each bear words, while the *Taixuan*’s four-layered chapters are supplemented by nine *zan*, governing what follows below. Therefore, chapters and *zan* proceed along separate paths, not interdependent. Both must be reckoned by days.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* arises from *Zhongfu*, and excluding the four cardinal hexagrams—*Zhen*, *Li*, *Dui*, and *Kan*—their twenty-four lines govern the twenty-four *qi*#9, while the remaining sixty hexagrams each span six days and seven fractions, totaling three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. *Zhongfu*’s initial line marks the start of the winter solstice. *Yi*’s upper line marks the end of the great snow. Thus, it cycles and returns to its beginning.\n\nThe *Taixuan*’s eighty-one chapters, each with nine *zan*, total seven hundred twenty-nine *zan*. Every two *zan* combine into one day—one for day, one for night—yielding three hundred sixty-four days and a half. Adding the *Zhuolei* two *zan* completes three hundred sixty-five days and one fraction. The first *zan* marks the start of the winter solstice, while the *Zhuolei* two *zan* mark the end of the great snow. It too cycles and returns to its beginning.\n\nAll *Taixuan* chapters follow the *Yijing*’s hexagram *qi* sequence but vary in nomenclature. The first is *Zhongfu*; the cyclical return is *Fu*; *Li* and *Xian* correspond to *Lun*; *Shao* to *Qian*; *Li* to *Kui*. The rest follow this pattern. Thus, the *Taixuan* chapters declare: *\"Eighty-one chapters, all affairs are divinely verified. The *Ce* says: 'Perform the *Xun Cheng* ritual, aligning with the Dipper’s encounter. The calendar marks the years, and the grains flourish in season.' All this is as stated.*\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Yuan*, *Heng*, *Li*, and *Zhen*; the *Taixuan* has *Wang*, *Zhi*, *Meng*, *Qiu*, and *Ming*. These five are the *Taixuan*’s virtues. *Wang* is the north, corresponding to *Zhen* in the *Yijing*. *Zhi* is the east, corresponding to *Yuan*. *Meng* is the south, corresponding to *Heng*. *Qiu* is the west, corresponding to *Li*#10. *Ming* is formless. Thus, the *Taixuan* text states: *\"Wang and Meng reach their extremes, Zhi and Qiu command each other; emerging from Ming and returning to Ming, new and old alternate.\"*\n\nSince the *Taixuan* begins at the winter solstice, it divides *Zhen* into *Wang* and *Ming*. *Wang* is the period after the winter solstice; *Ming* is before the great snow.\n\nThe *Yijing*’s *Great Correlation* number is fifty, with forty-nine in use. The *Taixuan*’s Heaven and Earth strategies are eighteen each, totaling thirty-six. Earth omits three, using thirty-three. The *Yijing* casts with four; the *Taixuan* casts with three. The *Taixuan* casting method: divide one hexagram in half, then use three casts per unit—one as *sou*, one as *huan*. Combine the remainder with *tiao*, and after one *tiao*, count the rest: seven as one, eight as two, nine as three. The *Yijing* has seven, nine, eight, and six—called the four symbols. The *Taixuan* has one, two, and three—called the threefold models. Both are the numerical foundations of hexagram chapters.\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Tuan*, the *Taixuan* has chapters. *Tuan* is the hexagram’s text; chapters likewise summarize the meaning of a single chapter. The *Yijing* has lines, the *Taixuan* has *zan*. The *Yijing* has symbols, the *Taixuan* has *Ce*. *Ce* interprets the *zan*. The *Yijing* has *Wenyan*, the *Taixuan* has *Wen*. *Wen* elucidates the Five Virtues, alongside the central chapter’s nine *zan*—akin to *Wenyan*.\n\nThe *Yijing* has *Xici*, the *Taixuan* has *Chui*, *Ying*, *Lian*, *Tu*, and *Gao*. These five expound upon the *Taixuan zan*—akin to *Xici*. The *Yijing* has *Shuo Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Shu*. *Shu* discusses the symbols of the nine *zan*—akin to *Shuo Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Xu Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Chong*. *Chong* sequences the eighty-one chapters, resolving yin and yang oppositions—akin to *Xu Guà*. The *Yijing* has *Za Guà*, the *Taixuan* has *Cuo*. *Cuo* interweaves and expounds upon the eighty-one chapters.

Though they guāyǎzé, if they seek only fleeting, immediate pleasure, how far is their suffering from them? It lies just beyond the door, no farther.\"*\n\nFrom the *Shī·Yúzhào* (Book of Poetry: \"The Fishes and Reeds\"), it censures King Yōu’s words: *\"All things lose their nature, the king dwelling in Hào and Jīng, shall find no joy in himself.\"*#\n\nThe fourth day: *\"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Stroking bonds and severing cords—truly a heart at ease. Bonds, the same as *system* (系). Cords, pronounced *shuāng* (as in 'thread'). To stroke, is to depart. Cords, are the central threads in the weft of a net.\"*#\nThe fourth day marks *tiáochàng* (harmony), while in daylight. The virtuous man follows the Dao/Way, finding joy in forgetting his cares, external things unable to burden him, and none are more free than he.#\nThus it says: *\"To stroke their bonds, to sever their cords, to abandon their thoughts.\"*\n\nThe fifth day: *\"Bell and drum clamor—clamor—pipes and strings sigh—sigh—perhaps to follow its decline.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Bell and drum clamor—joy followed by sorrow. Sigh—both pronounced *cuò* (as in 'wrong'). Sigh-sigh, the sound of fading thoughts.\"*#\nThe fifth day marks the petty man indulging in great fortune, unrestrained in his licentious pleasures. Joy to its extreme must bring sorrow; prosperity to its peak must decline.\n\nThe sixth day: *\"Great joy without interruption, people and spirits, birds and beasts all find their delight.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Great joy without interruption—none are left without embracing it.\"*#\n**Dàn** (as in \"charm\"), pronounced *púgān* (as in \"to float\").\n**Wáng** says: *\"The sixth day resides in a position of greatness, at the time of daylight, as the leader of the group. Without interruption means that between heaven and earth, all things find joy, and people, spirits, birds, and beasts each fulfill their nature and float in delight.\"*\n**Guāng** says: *\"Dàn (float), is joy.\"*#\nThe sixth day marks *lóngfú* (abundant blessings), *shèngduō* (great prosperity), and *jímǎ* (ultimate greatness). The virtuous man of the *Tàipíng* (Great Peace) era benefits all things, with no distinctions—people, spirits, birds, and beasts all find their place, and what joy is greater than this? The fourth day marks *xiàlù* (lower fortune), benefiting only oneself; the sixth day marks *shànglù* (higher fortune), benefiting all under heaven.\n\nThe seventh day: *\"Men laugh, ghosts laugh, heaven’s appointed term.\"*#\n**Cè** says: *\"Men laugh, ghosts laugh—celebrating the completion of joy.\"*#\nThe *Sòng* and *Lù* versions read *bēi* (low) instead of *bì* (completion); now following **Fàn**’s version.\n**Yāo** (term), pronounced *yúxiāo* (as in \"nightfall\").",

version.\n**Fàn** says:\n*\"Arrows rise on their own—\nthis is the power of feathers.\"*\nFeathers unite with the arrow’s shaft,\nand then they may fly.\nJust as the ruler and minister act in harmony,\nthey drive the wind and transform customs.\nThe carriage carries its load,\njust as the noble man aids the world in its affairs.\n\nThe fifth line:\n*\"The weaver’s labor\nis not as beneficial as the silkworm’s cocoon.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"The weaver’s labor—\nit brings no benefit to others.\"*\nThe silkworm’s cocoon (*suō* 緰) is pronounced *xū* (息浪切),\nmeaning *\"raw silk or cloth.\"* **Wáng** alters it to *\"cloth\"* (褕), pronounced *yáo* (遥).\n**Fàn** says:\n*\"Though the spider produces silk,\nits labor is not used by people,\nso it is less beneficial than the silkworm’s single cocoon.\"*\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"The fifth line represents weaving, making cloth, and raising silkworms—\nthe petty man’s affairs are not his own,\nlaboring without reward,\nso this symbol arises.\"*\n**Lǚ Ào** (旅獒) says:\n*\"If one does not engage in what is harmful to others\nand does what is beneficial,\nthen the labor is properly rewarded.\"*\n\nThe sixth line:\n*\"Flowering fruit, fragrant and abundant,\nits use is virtuous and proper.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Flowering fruit is fragrant,\nits use is virtuous—\nthis benefits the current year.\"*\n**Fàn**’s version lacks the character *\"fruit\"* (实),\nnow following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.\nThe sixth line represents the utmost of contemplation,\nthe completion of undertakings.\nThe completion of

line:\n*\"Losing its fragrance,\nthere is nowhere to go.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Losing its fragrance—\n**virtue/power** (德) begins to decline.\"*\n**Fàn** says:\n*\"The seventh line represents lost

noble man takes harmony and rectitude as his undertaking,\nso even calamity does not harm him.\"*\n\nThe ninth line:\n*\"Undertakings completed, self-destruction;\nrains completed, they fall in

be prevented?\"*\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"All things strive to create,\nyet undertakings completed inevitably fail—\nthis is why.\nThe petty man, when his work is done,\nbecomes arrogant and

(勖) as *\"overtakes\"* (冒),\nnow following the *Sòng*, *Lù*, and **Wáng** versions.\nStretch (*shēn* 信) is the same as extend (*shēn* 伸).\nIt speaks of the **Yáng** *qi* exhorting all things,\nas the black oil and kernels of fruits\neach fulfill their proper functions.\nAll things extend themselves,\nexhausting their strength,\nand follow their own affairs.\nUndertakings (*shì* 事) are what one strives to create;\naffairs (*shì* 事) are each fulfilling their proper roles.\n\nThe first line:\n*\"Affairs without affairs,\nthe utmost of affairs without fail.\"*\n**Chè** says:\n*\"Affairs without affairs—\nthis is the way of acting.\"*\n**Wáng** says:\n*\"All affairs are properly ordered,\nwhy should there be any action at all?\nSimply rectify their roots.\nYet when the **Yáng** *qi* is at its zenith during the day,\nat the start of affairs,\none may rectify their roots.\"*\n\n**Guāng** says:\n*\"The first line represents the beginning of contemplation,\nthe source of purity of heart,\nthe

line represents the middle of contemplation,\nso it says: *\"Affairs lie at the pivot.\"*\nThe pivot is where honor and disgrace,\nsafety and danger,\nare decided.\nWhen affairs are at the

      "translated_text": "The King says: **\"The Celestial Net\"** (天網) embodies the meaning of **being sparse yet not leaking**.\n\n**Master Guang** states: The **third day** (三) corresponds to **Thought** (思) above, and **daytime** (昼) is when. The **virtuous person** (君子) can **weave the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth** (经纬天地).\n\n**Li** (离) signifies **cultural refinement** (文明), and also bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象).\n\nOn the **fourth day** (四), **\"I lift my nets and traps\"** (援我罘罟), **\"entangling snares spread across the fields\"** (絓罗于野至). The **Divination** states: **\"Lifting nets and traps\"** (援次罘罟) is **unable to act with benevolence** (不能以仁). **\"Lift\"** (援) is pronounced *yuán* (爰切). **\"Net\"** (罘) is pronounced *fú* (浮切). **\"Entangling\"** (絓) is pronounced *húguà* (胡卦切). The **fourth day** (四) marks when **yang-qi** (陽氣) is about to **extinguish** (熄), while **yin-qi** (陰氣) is about to **arise** (生); **virtue** (德) departs and **punishment** (刑) arrives. Again, **Li** (离) bears the **symbol of nets and traps** (网罟之象), hence the saying **\"I lift my nets and traps\"** (援我罘罟), **\"entangling snares spread across the fields\"** (絓罗于野). **\"Arrive\"** (至) speaks of matters **drawing near**, as in the saying **\"treading frost\"** (履霜), **\"solid ice arrives\"** (坚冰至).\n\nOn the **fifth day** (五), **\"the dragon soars in Heaven\"** (龙翰于天), **\"its scales tremble with solemnity\"** (贞栗其鳞). The **Divination** states: **\"The dragon’s trembling\"** (龙翰之栗) signifies **uttermost fear of collapse** (极惧坠). **\"Soar\"** (翰) is pronounced *huán’ān* (胡安切). The King says: **Residing in the center** (居中) and **embodying rectitude** (体正), **obtaining its proper position** (得位) and **marking the time for response** (当画), it is the **master of correspondence** (应之主), hence the **symbol of the dragon flying in Heaven** (龙飞于天). **Master Guang** states: **The dragon** (龙) is used to **discuss yang** (论阳). **\"Soar\"** (翰) means **to fly** (飞). The **fifth day** (五) is **pure yang** (纯阳), the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), hence the saying **\"the dragon soars in Heaven\"** (龙翰于天). When the **virtuous person** (君子) stands at the **peak of greatness** (盛大之极), he **must not fail to be upright** (不可不正) and **must not fail to be solemn** (不可不惧), hence the saying **\"its scales tremble with solemnity\"** (贞栗其鳞).\n\nOn the **sixth day** (六), **\"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven\"** (炽承于天), **\"the ice begins to sprout from Earth\"** (冰萌于地). The **Divination** states: **\"Ascending Heaven, sprouting from Earth\"** (承天萌地) signifies **the beginning of yang’s retreat** (阳始退). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **\"blazing yang\"** (炽承) as **\"ascending yang\"** (烝云), where **\"ascending\"** (烝) is the ancient form of **\"blazing\"** (炽), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **\"Blazing\"** (炽) is the **peak of yang** (陽之盛). **\"Ice\"** (冰) is the **ultimate of yin** (陰之极). The **sixth day** (六) falls at the **start of the Summer Solstice** (夏至之初), the **juncture of yang’s peak and yin’s rise** (陽极陰生之际); **the Way of the petty man grows long** (小人道长), while **the Way of the virtuous person diminishes** (君子道消), hence the saying: **\"the blazing yang ascends to Heaven\"** (炽承于天), **\"the ice begins to sprout from Earth\"** (冰萌于地). **The subtle warnings of reverence and caution** (敬戒之微) are fully contained here.\n\nOn the **seventh day** (七), **\"the sun strengthens its decline\"** (日强其衰), **\"response flourishes with solemnity\"** (应蕃贞). The **Divination** states: **\"Strengthening its decline\"** (自强其衰) is **to hate the proliferation of ruinous influences** (恶败类). **\"Hate\"** (恶) is pronounced *wùgù* (乌故切). The **seventh day** (七) marks the **beginning of calamity** (祸始) and **the time for response** (当画). The **virtuous person**, if he **can strengthen his declining Way** (能自强其衰), will **find many responding to him** (则应之者蕃多) and **will not lose his rectitude** (而不失其正).\n\nOn the **eighth day** (八), **\"at the peak of yang, summoning yin\"** (极阳征阴), **\"response follows without delay\"** (不移日而应). The **Divination** states: **\"At the peak of yang, summoning yin\"** (极阳征阴) is **the response to its manifestation** (应其发). The **King’s reading** (王本) takes **\"summoning\"** (征) as **\"subtle\"** (微), and **\"response\"** (应) as **\"time\"** (时), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Fàn readings** (今从宋、陆、范本). **When governance reaches its peak, disorder is summoned** (治极召乱), **when greatness reaches its peak, decline is summoned** (盛极召衰), **when fortune reaches its peak, calamity is summoned** (福极召祸), hence the response **without delay** (不移日而应).\n\nOn the **ninth day** (上九), **\"at the ultimate of Li\"** (元离之极), **the virtuous person responds with the Great Millet** (君子应以大稷). The **Divination** states: **\"At the ultimate of Li\"** (元离之极) is **unable to be restrained** (不可遏). **Fàn’s reading** (范本作) takes it as **\"unable to be restrained\"** (不可遏), now following the **Sòng, Lù, and Wáng readings** (今从宋、陆、王本). **Master Lù** (陆) says: **\"Restrained\"** (遏) means **to stop** (止). The **King** (王) says: **\"Great\"** (大) signifies **the sun approaching its setting** (日将暮). **Master Wú** (吴) says: **\"Millet\"** (稷) is pronounced and shares meaning with **\"Wu\"** (吴). **Master Guang** (光) states: **\"Li\"** (元离) is **Great Clarity** (大明). At the **ultimate of Great Clarity** (大明之极), **greatness at its peak must decline** (极盛必衰). The **virtuous person responds to the times** (君子应时), **aligning with their waxing and waning** (与之消息), hence the saying **\"the virtuous person responds with the Great Wu\"** (君子应以大吴).\n\n*(End of the third volume of the \"太玄经\" (Tàixuān Jīng) annotations.

      "translated_text": "「Entering the *Cháng* (常) phase, the twenty-third day of the twenty-sixth degree—*Lìqiū* (立秋) aligns with the *qi* (气). The day corresponds to **Qúntǎo** (鹑尾), the **Fùxiàng** (斗) constellation marks the **Shēn** (申) position, and the **Yízhé** (夷则) musical pitch resonates.\n\n**Ninth (shedding):** The day relinquishes its **Yì** (翼).\nBy **Yīn** (阴) one discerns the **Bì** (辟) [as **Bì**, pronounced *bì*, or \"wall\"#17], by **Yáng** (阳) one discerns the **Jūn** (君) [as \"sovereign\"].\nThe **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) [as \"minister\"] **Dao** (道) is immutable across the ten thousand ages.\n**Bì** (辟), when read as **Jūn** (君), is \"sovereign.\"\n\n**Song** (宋) says: **Bì** (辟) is the **Jūn** (君).\nThis is the beginning of **Lìqiū** (立秋).\nAs autumn succeeds summer, it is the **Dao** (道) of Heaven.\nThus at this time, **Yīn** (阴) knows to serve as **Chén** (臣), **Yáng** (阳) knows to act as **Jūn** (君).\n**Guāng** (光) says: As autumn succeeds summer, as **Yīn** (阴) succeeds **Yáng** (阳), as **Chén** (臣) succeeds **Jūn** (君)—this is the symbol.\n\n**First (day):** Wearing the **Dàishén** (戴神) [as \"donning the divine\"] **Mò** (墨) [as \"black ink\"], stepping on the **Lǚlíng** (履灵) [as \"treading the sacred\"] **Shì** (式) [as \"pattern\"], with one to govern ten thousand, yet never failing in **Wú** (吴) [as \"harmony\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: Wearing **Dàishén** (戴神) **Mò** (墨) is to embody one form.\n**Wáng** (王) and **Wú** (吴) both say: **Jì** (稷) is the same as **Wú** (吴).\n**Mò** (墨) and **Shì** (式) are both **Fǎ** (法) [as \"principles\"]—the **Shén** (神) and **Líng** (灵) [as \"divine and numinous\"] are revered.\nOne is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as \"noble one\"]’s heart clings to one principle as the constant **Fǎ** (法), responding to all transformations of the ten thousand things, yet never lacking in **Wú** (吴) [as \"harmony\"].\nThe *Yì* (易) [as *Book of Changes*] says: \"All movement under Heaven is governed by steadfast adherence to the One.\"\n**Second (day):** The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微) [as \"subtle\"], **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) [as \"female steadfastness\"] **Lì** (厉) [as \"perilous\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) within is **Wēi** (微), the **Nǚ** (女) [as \"female\"] is not steadfast.\n**Wáng** (王) originally wrote **Chángnèi** (常内) **Wēi** (微), but now follows the other schools.\n**Wáng** (王) says: During the **Cháng** (常) phase, one should uphold the proper **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣), **Fùfù** (夫妇) [as \"husband and wife\"].\nThe second day loses its position at night#18—this is the **Cháng** (常) phase subtly yielding to a lowly **Nǚ** (女) [as \"female\"] within.\nThe symbol of unsteadfastness is near danger, hence **Nǚzhēn** (女贞) **Lì** (厉) [as \"perilous\"].\n\n**Third (day):** The day upholds its **Dé** (德) [as \"virtue/power\"], three years without eating.\n**Cè** (测) says: The day upholds its **Dé** (德), the **Jūn** (君)’s **Dao** (道) is clear.\nThree is self-so, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe day upholds its **Dé** (德), thus escaping the calamity of meager nourishment.\nThe **Jūn** (君) upholds his **Dé** (德), thus avoiding the guilt of reckless usurpation.\n**Yīyǐn** (伊尹) admonished **Tàijiǎ** (太甲), composing the *Xián yǒu yī Dé* (咸有一德).\n\n**Fourth (day):** The month does not uphold, sometimes losing it in **Xíng** (行) [as \"conduct\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The month does not uphold, the **Chén** (臣) loses his **Xíng** (行).\n**Xíng** (行) is read as it is written.\nThe month has waxing and waning, hence it does not uphold.\n**Xíng** (行) is the **Dao** (道).\nFour is **Wàitā** (外佗) [as \"external excess\"], yet it occurs at night.\nIf the **Chén** (臣)’s **Dé** (德) is not constant, he loses the **Dao** (道).\n\n**Fifth (day):** Its **Cóng** (从) [as \"following\"] and its **Héng** (横) [as \"crossing\"], the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth.\n**Cè** (测) says: Its **Cóng** (从) and its **Héng** (横) are the constants of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣).\n**Cóng** (从), pronounced *róng* (容).\n**Fàn** (范) says: Heaven follows Earth’s crossing—this is their constant **Dao** (道).\n**Wáng** (王) says: The fifth day occupies the middle position, as the master of **Cháng** (常).\nObtaining its position during the day, it follows and crosses the **Jīngwéi** (经纬) [as \"vertical and horizontal principles\"], all in accord with the constant **Dao** (道) of Heaven and Earth, attaining the immutable **Dao** (道) across the ten thousand ages.\n**Guāng** (光) says: Five is the **Zhōnghé** (中和) [as \"central harmony\"], the peak of **Cháng** (常).\nThe **Dao** (道) of **Jūn** (君) and **Chén** (臣) is their **Jīngwéi** (经纬).\n\n**Sixth (day):** Obtaining seven and nine, the **nuò** (懦) [as \"weak\"] and **náo** (挠) [as \"flexible\"] overcome the **gāng** (刚) [as \"rigid\"], unable to uphold the **Cháng** (常).\n**Cè** (测) says: Obtaining seven and nine is to abandon **Shèng** (盛) [as \"peak\"] and ride upon **Cuī** (衰) [as \"decline\"].\nSeven is the peak of **Yáng** (阳).\nNine is the decline of **Yáng** (阳).\nThe sixth day passes the middle and occurs at night—abandoning peak and riding decline.\nThe petty man is weak, bending and corrupting his rigidity, unable to guard his constant **Dao** (道).\n\n**Seventh (day):** **Tāotāo** (滔滔) [as \"flowing\"] **wǎnglái** (往来) [as \"movement\"], with **Cháng** (常) decline as **Rú** (如) [as \"pattern\"], able to uphold the **Zhēn** (贞) [as \"steadfast\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: **Tāotāo** (滔滔) **wǎnglái** (往来) is to uphold the proper **Dao** (道) in response to the improper.\n\n**Eighth (day):** The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) [as \"illness\"] yet not **Jí** (疾), the **jiù** (咎) [as \"fault\"] is formed yet not **Jí** (诘) [as \"rectified\"].\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Cháng** (常) is **Jí** (疾) yet not **Jí** (疾)—it cannot self-govern.\nEight is the midpoint of calamity, yet it occurs at night.\nThe **Cháng** (常) **Dao** (道), long practiced, now has weariness—hence **Chángjí** (常疾).\nIf one who is ill knows his illness, it may still be treated.\nIf one does not know his illness yet abhors hearing of it#20, then it is certainly incurable#21.\nThe petty man does not know his calamity yet abhors hearing of it, until the **xiōngjiù** (凶咎) [as \"grievous fault\"] is formed#22—it cannot be rectified again.\n\n**Upper Ninth (day):** **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾), **Wūyī** (巫医) [as \"diviners and healers\"] do not fail.\n**Cè** (测) says: **Jí** (疾) its **Jí** (疾)—able to self-heal.\n**Wáng** (王) says: The ninth day occupies the extreme peak, yet obtains its position during the day—one who can **Jí** (疾) his **Jí** (疾).\nGood at self-admonition, thus the **Wūyī** (巫医) [as \"diviners and healers\"] do not fail in treating him.\n**Wūyī** (巫医) refers to wise counselors.\n**Guāng** (光) says: The ninth is the end of calamity, yet it occurs during the day.\nThe **Jūnzǐ** (君子) [as \"noble one\"] can reflect on misfortune and preemptively guard against it, receiving loyal advice and seeking wise counsel to aid himself—thus calamity may be resolved.\n\nTwo regions, three states, three departments, one family—**Dù** (度) [as \"measure\"].\n**Yīn** (阴) family **Huǒ** (火) [as \"fire\"], corresponds to **Jié** (节) [as \"regulation\"].\n**Fǎ** (法) [as \"principles\"] serve as models, **Dù** (度) [as \"measure\"] serves as the standard.\n**Yīn** (阴) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Zào** (躁) [as \"agitated\"], **Yáng** (阳) *qi* (气) grows increasingly **Shě** (舍) [as \"retreating\"].\n**Zào** (躁) and **Zào** (躁) **Shě** (舍) and **Shě** (舍), each attains its **Dù** (度).\n**Shě** (舍), pronounced *shě*, or read as it is written.\n**Sòng** (宋) says: **Zào** (躁), movement.\n**Shě** (舍), concealment.\n**Wáng** (王) says: **Shě** (舍), cessation.\n**Guāng** (光) says: **Zào** (躁) refers to **Yīn** (阴) advancing in vigor.\n**Shě** (舍) refers to **Yáng** (阳) withdrawing.\nThe **Zào** (躁) grows more **Zào** (躁), the **Shě** (舍) grows more **Shě** (舍)—each guards its constant **Dù** (度).\n\n**First (day):** The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost.\n**Cè** (测) says: The central **Dù** (度) alone is lost—it cannot achieve success.\nOne is the beginning of thought, yet it occurs at night.\nThe petty man’s measure in the heart has already strayed and been lost—how could he achieve success?\nThe *Shāngshū* (商书) [as *Book of Documents*] says: \"If one anticipates danger and sets traps, then going to inspect and rectify according to **Dù** (度) will release [the situation].\"\n\n**Second (day):** The **Zé** (泽) [as \"benefits\"] does not **Shě** (舍) [as \"retreat\"], **Míng** (冥) [as \"obscure\"] within the **Dù** (度).\n**Cè** (测) says: The **Zé** (泽) does not **Shě** (舍)—only then can it be proper.\n\n**Third (day):** The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差) [as \"erratic\"], the **Dà** (大) **Lǎi** (攋) [as \"collapse\"] is the stage.\n**Cè** (测) says: The small **Dù** (度) is **Chāchā** (差差), the great **Dù** (度) is **Qīng** (倾) [as \"tilting\"].\nSmall **Sòng** (宋), **Chén** (陈), and **Wú** (吴) manuscripts originally read **Tā** (獭) [as \"otter\"], but **Wáng** (王) read **Qīng** (倾), and now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Fàn** (范) manuscripts.\n**Fàn** (范) manuscripts read **Chāchā** (差差) as **Zhīchā** (之差), but now follows **Sòng** (宋), **Lǚ** (陆), and **Wáng** (王) manuscripts.\n**Lǎi** (攋), pronounced *lài* (赖).\n**Guāng** (光) says: **Lǎi** (攋) is \"ruin and fracture\"#28.",

But during the **Chùshǔ** (处暑) season, when **Yin** (阴) does not transform and **Yang** (阳) does not act, all things are sealed.\n\nOn the first day, **\"Lì\"** (唫) does not give, and men dwell like women. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) does not give, which is contrary to human nature. **\"Yǔ\"** (予) is the same as **\"yǔ\"** (与). **Wáng** (王) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) is to close oneself off and not engage with others, like a man imitating a woman’s seclusion. **Guāng** (光) says: One is the beginning of thought, occurring at night, dwelling in the depths below. The **junzi** (君子) contemplates the **Dao** (道) and seeks to extend it to others, yet now he is sealed and does not engage—like a man dwelling as a woman does.\n\nA solitary person without kin will be shunned by all, hence it is said, \"contrary to human nature.\"\n\nOn the second day, **\"lì\"** (唫) is in the blood, nourishing the **Qián** (乾) bones. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the blood makes one emaciated yet fattened. **Fàn** (范) originally wrote **\"zāi\"** (臞), pronounced *yūfù*, but all other versions write **\"zāi\"** (臞), with Small Song pronouncing it *jù* and Wu *qú*; we follow this. **Wáng** (王) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the blood nourishes the **Qián** (乾) bones, fearing emaciation and seeking to fatten oneself. **Guāng** (光) says: Two is the middle of thought, occurring in the day, able to accumulate **virtue** (德) to beautify the body. The *Dàxué* (大学) says: *\"Wealth moistens the house, **virtue** moistens the body.\"*\n\nOn the third day, the face does not engage, the mouth **chā** (唭), and **\"lì\"** (唫) has no words. **Cè** (测) says: The face does not engage, and human conduct is faint. **Fàn** (范) and **Wáng** (王) omit the mouth radical; we follow Small Song, Lu, and the second Song versions. **Chā** (唭) is pronounced *qùlì*, and **\"yù\"** (唭) is pronounced *yújì*. **Fàn** (范) says: **Chā** (唭) is sound without words. **Wáng** (王) says: Human conduct nearly reaches extinction. **Guāng** (光) says: Three is the end of thought, and also the completion of intention. Once thought is complete, speech and appearance can engage with others. But if the family nature is sealed, even during the day, it remains closed and unengaged—human conduct nearly vanishes. The *Yì* (易) *Jié* (节) hexagram, line two, says: *\"Not going out of the gate or courtyard—disaster.\"*\n\nOn the fourth day, **\"lì\"** (唫) is in the grains, neither thriving nor common, burdening the old and the clan. **Cè** (测) says: **\"Lì\"** (唫) in the grains means they cannot be shared.\n\nOn the fifth day, neither central nor supervising, the stingy decay of rot and worms. **Cè** (测) says: Neither central nor supervising—this **\"lì\"** (唫) is wrong. Small Song says: *\"Salaries await the worthy, yet granaries overflow with rotting grain—still they are stingy with their **lì** (唫)—this is wrong.\"* **Guāng** (光) says: **\"Dū\"** (督) is also **\"zhōng\"** (中). The **junzi** (君子) accumulates and knows how to disperse; if it should be sealed, then seal; if it should be applied, then apply. In the fifth position of abundance, the family nature is sealed, straying from the middle way during the day—thus rotting yet still stingy.\n\nOn the sixth day, springs and sources flow abundantly, sealed in hills and gardens. **Cè** (测) says: The sealing of springs and sources is not to be criticized. The second Song, Lu, and **Wáng** (王) versions write **\"yì\"** (议) instead of **\"jī\"** (讥); we follow **Fàn** (范). **Fàn** (范) says: Six is water, hence springs and sources. Hills and gardens are used to illustrate elevation. **Guāng** (光) says: Six is the peak of abundance, the utmost.

Ghostly apparitions (鬼魂) are vague (恍惚), flickering between presence and absence (若有若无), truly deserving of doubt (疑).\n**Black not as crow** (莫黑匪乌), **red not as fox** (莫赤匪狐)—these are distinctions

      "translated_text": "「Guāng says: The fourth **color (sè)** is **white (bái)**, which signifies **low rank and fortune (xià lù)**, **external but not intrinsic (wài tāi)**, and is the adornment of **petty people (xiǎo rén)** who embellish their outward appearance to gain fortune. **Prolonged pretense must fail (wěi jiǔ bì bài)**, just as **powdering the forehead (fěn tí)** and encountering rain causes the **mustache to cling with dampness (wū xū)**,—how could others find it pleasing (hǎo) when they see it?\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** is **luan-fèng (鸾凤) in riotous display (fēn rú)**, and its **virtue/power (dé)** shines **brilliantly (huī rú)**. **Guāng says:** *Luan-fèng in riotous display (鸾凤纷如)* means **virtue/power radiant and pure (dé guāng hào)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *huī (晖)* as *shí (时)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**.\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** occupies the **highest rank (zūn wèi)**, receives **great blessings (shèng fú)**, yet is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)**. When the **Sovereign’s virtue/power shines (zhōng dé huī rú)** and **auspicious omens (jiā ruì)** gather, then the *luan-fèng* appear in abundance. **Jiā Yì (贾谊)** says: *The phoenix soars at a thousand rèn (仞), gazing upon the radiant virtue/power and descending (览德晖而下之).*\n\nThe sixth **color (sè)** is **white chariot with emerald canopy (sù chē cuì gài)**, which is **harmful to vision (wéi shì zhī hài)**, yet **pure (zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *White chariot with emerald canopy (素车翠盖)* is merely **loveliness of outward appearance (tú hǎo wài)**. The sixth **color (sè)** signifies **high fortune (shàng lù)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** without virtue/power (dé) yet holding fortune (lù) are **lovely without but ugly within (wài hǎo nèi chǒu)**, like riding a **white chariot (sù chē)** while displaying an **emerald canopy (cuì gài)**—their outward appearance seems splendid, but inwardly they lack refinement. **The pure (zhēn)** must be **judged with upright vision (dāng yǐ zhèng shì)**, then their **beauty and ugliness will be self-evident (zhī hǎo chǒu fēn fēn)**.\n\nThe seventh **color (sè)** is **to observe its flaws (shì qí xiá)**, yet **without impurity (wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *To observe its flaws (视其瑕)* means **one can correct oneself (néng zì jiāo)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *wú (无)* as *wǎng (罔)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: The seventh **color (sè)** occupies a **position of excess (guò mǎn zhī dì)**, yet one still holds rank at **day (dāng zhòu)**—this is the ability to **examine one’s flaws in accordance with the times (yīn shí ér zì shì qí xiá)**, to **guard against faults before they arise (jiè yú wèi méng)**, so that **blame and regret do not take root (guā zǔi bù shēng)**, and thus **impurity never appears (gù wéi wú huì)**. **Guāng says:** *This is why the seventh **color (sè)** is seen at **day (dāng zhòu)***—it marks the **beginning of calamity (huò shǐ)**.\n\nThe eighth **color (sè)** is **feicui (翡翠) in flight (yú fēi)**, **detaching its wings (lí qí yì)**; the **fur of the fox (hú máo)** becomes **one’s own undoing (gōng qí zéi)**. **Guāng says:** *Feicui and fox fur (翡翠狐鼠)* are **loveliness in form (hǎo zuò)**, yet **a cause for blame (jiù)**. **Má (鼦)**, pronounced *dū liáo (都聊)切*, is the same as *diāo (貂)*. **Fàn (范)** says: **Each uses its patterned fur (wén máo)**, yet **both bring about disaster (shì shēn zhī huò)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Wǎng (罔) detaches its wings (lí qí yì)*. **Guāng says:** *The eighth **color (sè)** is the **midpoint of calamity (huò zhōng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **External beauty (wài guān zhī měi)** becomes **a personal misfortune (shì shēn zhī zāi)**. **Mèngzǐ (孟子)** says: *A man like Běnchéng (盆成) may have some talent (xiǎo yǒu cái)*, yet **if he has not heard the Great Dao/Way of the Noble (dà dào)**, then **it is enough to ruin his life (bì zhì shēn ér wéi yǐ)**.\n\nThe ninth **color (sè)** is **the sun setting its light (rì méi qí guāng)**, **glowing in the east (bīn yú dōng fāng)**, **observing its origins (yòng shì qí shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *The sun setting and glowing in the east (rì yù bīn dōng)*, **finally turning back to its beginning (zhōng gù shǐ)**#38. **Fàn (范)** says: *Bīn (贲)* means **yellow-white hue (huáng-bái sè)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *The sun as it sets glows in the east (rì zhī jiāng méi bīn dōng fāng)*. **Guāng says:** *The ninth **color (sè)** is the **end of vision (shì zhī zhōng)**, yet it appears at **day (dāng zhòu)**. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** cultivates **virtue/power (dé)** and establishes **achievements (lèng gōng)**, **treating the end as the beginning (shèn zhōng rú shǐ)**. As the sun sets, it **reflects back upon the east (fǎn zhào dōng fāng)**. **The *Yì* (易) says:** *To observe one’s steps (shì lǚ)*, **to examine omens (kǎo xiáng)**, **and to return to their roots (qí xuán yuán jí)** is **ultimately auspicious (shǐ zhuān yuán jí)**. **The three regions, two states, one department, and one family (sān fāng èr zhōu yī bù yī jiā)** are submerged in **yin (yīn)**, **water (shuǐ)**, and **observation (guān)** is also appropriate here.\n\nThe fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the sun abandoning its family (rì shě shì)**. **Yīn (沈)** means **to descend or sink (xià shì)**. The **other versions (jū jiā)** assume this to be **yīn duì (沈兑)**, but this is incorrect. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** proceed separately, yet **both yearn for the other (xiāng sī)**. Their **intentions lie in the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**. **Sòng (宋)** says: *Xiāng (怀)* means **to ponder (sī)**. **Yīn (阴)** and **yáng (阳)** have long been distinct, yet **they both converge in autumn (qiū zhōng)**, **mutually yearning (xiāng sī)**, so their **intentions are both fixed upon the Mysterious Palace (xiān gōng)**.\n\nThe first **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **not hearing the pure (bù wén zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink one’s ears in the inner chamber (沈耳于闺)* means **losing the essence of virtue/power (shī dé tǐ)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The first **color (sè)** is the **ear (ěr)**, **which is submerged in water (shuǐ zhōng)**, hence **sinking (yīn)***. **Guāng says:** *The first **color (sè)** is the **lowest of low (xià xià)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** delight in **sinking their ears in the inner chamber (yīn ěr yú guī)**, **listening secretly (qián tīng)**, **to uncover others’ hidden affairs (yǐ xià rén zhī yǐn sī)**, yet **they do not hear the Noble’s upright Dao/Way (zhēn dào)**. **Even if they fill their ears with tassels (chuí liáng chōng ěr)**, **they still cannot perceive hidden truths (wù wú yǐn qíng)**.\n\nThe second **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **sinking vision to self-perception (yīn shì zì jiàn)**, **superior to the one-eyed’s glance (xiàn yú miǎo zhī miǎn)**. **Guāng says:** *Sinking vision’s perception (沈视之见)* attains **true beauty (dé zhèng měi)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *The second **color (sè)** is the **eye (mù)**, yet **it belongs to the sinking family (yīn jiā)**, hence **sinking vision (yīn shì)***. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads: *Miǎo (眇)*; **one-eyed and blind (yī mù máng)**. **Miǎn (眄)** is **oblique vision (yé shì)**. **Guāng says:** *The second **color (sè)** is **mid-thought (sī zhōng)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **Sinking vision (yīn shì)** within oneself **perceives both good and evil (zì jiàn shàn è)**, **attaining its true beauty (dé qí zhèng měi)**. It is **superior to petty people (xiàn yú xiǎo rén)**, who **cannot inwardly reflect (bù néng nèi xǐng)** yet **spy on others’ right and wrong (páng kuī tā rén zhī shì fēi)**. Like **the one-eyed (miǎo mù)**, **they themselves are unclear (jǐ zé bù míng)**, yet **they delight in oblique vision (hǎo yé shì)**.\n\nThe third **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **to sink in beauty (yīn yú měi)**, **losing the true arrow (shī zhēn shǐ)**. **Guāng says:** *To sink in beauty (沈于美)* means **acting like the deaf and blind (zuò lóng máng)**. **Fàn (范)** says: *Shǐ (矢)* means **straightforwardness (zhí)**. **Guāng says:** *The third **color (sè)** is **upper thought (sī shàng)**, yet it appears at **night (dāng yè)**. **Petty people (xiǎo rén)** **are drowned in the beauty of sounds and colors (yīn yì shēng sè zhī měi)**, **losing their upright nature (shī qí zhèng zhí zhī xìng)**. **Lǎozǐ (老子)** says: *The five tones (yīn) make one’s ears deaf (ér lóng), the five colors (sè) make one’s eyes blind (mù máng)*. This means **what one hears and sees is not truly perceived (suǒ wén jiàn jiē bù dé qí zhèng)**, **like the deaf and blind (rú lóng máng)**.\n\nThe fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. Like the **phoenix chick (fèng xià)**, **it does not feed unless it finds the right place (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, then **it gathers (rán jié yǐ)**. **The fourth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the phoenix chick (yuān chú) sinking its vision (yīn shì)**, **selecting bitter food (shí kǔ zhēn)**. **Guāng says:** *Yuān chú (宛雏) sinking its vision (沈视)* means **choosing the direction of nourishment (zé shí fāng)**. The **small Sòng (小宋)** version reads *yuān (宛)* as *miǎn (冕)*, but now following the **other versions (jū jiā)**. **Wáng (王)** says: *Yuān chú (宛雏)* belongs to the **phoenix (fèng)**. **Guāng says:** *The fourth **color (sè)** is **low fortune (xià lù)**, yet it appears in the **yin (yè)** phase. **The Noble (jūnzǐ)** **chooses fortune to sustain (zé lù ér shí)**, **holding fast to bitter purity (shǒu kǔ jié xún zhèng dào)**. As the **phoenix chick (fèng chú)**, **it gazes downward at the four lands (xiàng dī yú sì fāng)**, **and only feeds on bamboo and grain (fèi zhú shí)**, **selecting the place where it can feed (bì zé kě shí zhī fāng)**, **then gathering (rán jié yǐ)**.\n\nThe fifth **color (sè)** in **yin (yīn)** is **the carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (gāo xiáng)**, **sinking its belly (yīn qí fù)**, **delighting in foul gruel (hǎo è jiù)**. **Guāng says:** *The carved eagle (diāo yīng) soaring high (高翔)* is **found in rotten grain (zài fǔ liáng)**. The **Sòng (宋)** and **Lǔ (陆)** versions read *jiù (粥)* as *shéng (绳)*, but now following the **Fàn (范)** and **Wáng (王)** versions. **Wú (吴)** says: *Jiù (粥)* is an ancient form of *yù (育)*. **Guāng says:** *The *Guānzǐ (管子)* says: *A woman does not abandon her husband (fù)*#42. **Jiù (粥)** shares the same **heart (xīn)** as *yù (育)*, with **good and evil (hǎo è)** read as the character itself.

What can be counted is also what is complete. The *Book of Documents (书)* lacks more than half its content, yet scholars unfamiliar with it cannot grasp its essence, for there are no numerical principles to establish its categories and forms. The **Mysterious Calculations** allow the diviner to know the order of the **First Praises** (首赞) concerning the day and stars, thus maintaining the celestial order (经天) and human relationships (彝伦) without confusion.\n\nIf one obtains a **Direction**, a **State**, a **Division**, and three **Families** in divination, then the **Family** is placed as three, and the **Direction**, **State**, and **Division** are all without increase, totaling three. This is the order of the **First Praise** (玄首之次), three in count. All increases are derived from the initial **Family** numbers.\n\nTo seek the **Praise of Manifestation** (表之赞), place the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtract the **Great Beginning** (太始) divination count, reduce by one and multiply by nine, then add the **Praise**. Subtract half of the **Mysterious Name** count, and one obtains the **Praise** subtracted from the Winter Solstice count.\n\nEven is the night of the obtained day, odd is the day of the obtained day. Xu (许) and Huang (黄) read this as *ming* (明), Song (宋) and Guo (郭) read it as *dé* (得).\n\nPlacing the **Mysterious Name** (玄姓), subtracting the **Great Beginning** count and reducing by one means subtracting the first **Praise** of the placed **Mysterious Name**. Multiplying by nine means each **Praise** is counted nine times. Subtracting the first **Praise** of the **Mysterious Name**, one then calculates the **Praise** to be added. One **Praise** increases by one, two by two, three by three.\n\nTo seek the day, subtract the **Mysterious Name** count from the **Praise**, then halve it: two **Praises** make one day, hence an even **Praise** is the night, and an odd **Praise** is the day.\n\nIf divination yields a response, from the center to the response, totaling forty-one, then place forty-one, reduce by one and multiply by nine, resulting in three hundred sixty. Add the obtained **Praise**, subtract half of three hundred sixty, and one obtains one hundred eighty, which is the count subtracted from the Winter Solstice.\n\nIncrease by one to get three hundred sixty-one, an odd **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the day. Increase by two to get three hundred sixty-two, an even **Praise**, marking the one hundred eighty-one days of the night.\n\nTo seek the star, begin with **The Ox of the Net** (牵牛).

      "translated_text": "The **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. The **Vague** is the north, winter, where form has not yet emerged. The **Direct** is the east, spring, where substance exists but lacks adornment. The **Covered** is the south, summer, where things grow long and may all be grasped and worn. *Xu* and *Huang* read it as **Load** (载), *Zhang* and *Ding* as **Wear** (戴), *Guo* as **Wear** (戴).\n\nThe **Mature** is the west, autumn, where all things take shape and are completed. When form exists, it returns to the formless, hence the **Dark**. Therefore, all things are **Vague** in the north, **Direct** in the east, **Covered** in the south, **Mature** in the west, and **Dark** in the north.\n\nThus, the **Vague** is the dwelling of the **Having**; the **Direct**, the foundation of **Adornment**; the **Covered**, the master of **Decay**; the **Mature**, the repository of **Life**; and the **Dark**, the storehouse of **Illumination**.\n\nThe **Vague** shelters its **Qi**; the **Direct** encounters its kind. The **Covered** reaches its peak in growth; the **Mature** examines its completion. *Fan* notes: \"Examine things to make them fully realized.\" The main text reads **Close** (亲), but this is an error by the copyist. *Song* and *Guo* read it as **Completion** (就). The **Dark** reflects its depths.\n\nThe **Vague** and **Covered** reach extremes; the **Direct** and **Mature** admonish each other. Emerging from the **Dark** and returning to the **Dark**, the new and the old alternate. *Zhang* reads it as **Loan** (贷).\n\nYin and Yang succeed one another; clarity and turbidity intermingle. Those who advance are promoted; those who succeed are retired. When used, they are **debased**; when timely, they are **noble**. The celestial patterns and earthly substances remain unaltered in their positions.\n\nThe **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**. From the **Vague** come speech, action, and blessings or calamities. In the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed.\n\nAction leaves a trace; speech has sound; blessings bring **Strength** (膊). *Yin* **Shàn** (剸) means \"to cut flesh\"; also read as *Yin* **Shùnguǎn** (竖衮). Calamities manifest in form—this is the **Direct**.\n\nIf there is the **Direct**, one may be **Covered**; if **Covered**, one may reach **Maturity**; if **Mature**, one returns to the **Dark**. Therefore, in the **Vague**’s time, all may be regulated—thus the eighty-one schools arise from the **Vague**.\n\nThe heavens shine brilliantly from the **boundless** (无畛). *Yin* **Xuàn** (炫) is read as *Hu* **Yàn** (胡绚). The **radiant** (熿熿) emerges from the **limitless** (无垠). *Yin* **Guāng** (熿) is read as *Hù* **Guāng** (户光), the same as **Resplendent** (煌).\n\nThus, in the **Vague**’s time, all is mysterious indeed. Therefore, the Dao of Heaven conceals itself in **depth**, stirs to **reveal**, exalts to **overlook**, regulates to **restrain**, and concludes in **obscurity**. Its depths are unfathomable; its brilliance is boundless.\n\nHence, the sage hides in **depth** to properly honor the spirits, stirs to **reveal** to inspire the people, shines brightly to **encompass** and illuminate, regulates to **restrain** to make all tremble—*Yin* **Nǐlì** (牛力) or *Yin* **Nǐ** (拟)—and conceals in **obscurity** to remain hidden.\n\nThe sage who embodies these five aspects is thus called the **Vague**, the **Direct**, the **Covered**, the **Mature**, and the **Dark**.\n\nSomeone asks: Why does *Kunlun* **Pāngbó** (昆仑旁薄) relate to **obscurity** (幽)?\n\nIt is said: The sage, like the heavens and earth, contemplates and encompasses all things. Within *Kunlun*, form has not yet manifested externally; dwelling alone in joy, pondering alone in sorrow—joy is unbearable, sorrow is insurmountable—hence it is called **obscurity**.\n\nWhy does the spirit contend in the **mysterious** (玄)?\n\nIt is said: The petty person’s heart is mixed, seeking to manifest externally, and uses Yin and Yang to contend over auspiciousness or inauspiciousness. Yang contends over auspiciousness; Yin contends over inauspiciousness.\n\nThe wind reveals the tiger; the clouds reveal the dragon. The sage acts, and all things harmonize. The dragon emerges from within—why is this so?\n\nIt is said: The dragon is where **virtue/power** (德) first takes form. If Yin does not reach its extreme, Yang does not arise; if chaos does not reach its extreme, **virtue/power** (德) does not manifest.\n\nThe sage cultivates **virtue/power** (德) to await the time, neither acting before its due nor lagging behind. When movement and stillness are subtly discerned, without losing their principles—who but the sage can do this?\n\nThus, the beginning and end may be used as **ordinary** (庸).\n\nThe *Kù* is empty with no cause—greatly receiving life and fate—why is this so?\n\nIt is said: The petty person cannot embrace emptiness or dwell in lowliness; they are **level and common** (庳), yet cannot be **overlooked**. Empty yet able to be **filled**, lacking yet able to **have**, relying on causes to **act**—thus they greatly receive life and fate without **avoidance** (辟), hence the *Kù* is **obscured** (否). All versions read it as \"without **speech or avoidance** (无辞辟),\" but *Ding* and *Zhang* omit the **speech** (无辞) character.\n\nThe day aligns with the heavens—why is this so?",

      "translated_text": "「Thus, its foundation is such that it can remain undiluted. When the **Dao of day and night** (*zhòuyè zhī dào*) is unclear, the affairs of **the Junzi** (*君子*) and **the petty person** (*小人*) become intertwined, then those called **benevolent** (*rén*) may fail to distinguish three times out of ten, and those called **righteous** (*yì*) may enter into what is not righteous without discernment. This would cause conduct to lose its **pure virtue** (*chún dé*), which is not the **true order of Heaven’s command** (*tiān mìng zhī zhèng*).\n\nThe **Profound Dao** (*Xuán*) proclaims the **Great Instruction** (*dà xùn*), and thus **correctness prevails** (*zhèng shèng yǐ*).\n\nThe **Eleven Chapters** (*Yòu shíyī piān*) are elucidated with the *Exegesis* (*Shìwén*), sourced from Xu Han’s *Phonetic Examination* (*Yīnkǎo*). The **Wang** refers to **Tang Wang Yi** (*王即唐王涯*); the **Chen** refers to **modern Chen Jian** (*陈即近世陈渐*), who compiled *The Performance of the Profound* (*Yǎn Xuán*); the **Wu** refers to **Wu Bi** (*吴秘*), who authored *Phonetic Meanings* (*Yīnyì*); the **Guo** refers to **Guo Yuanheng** (*郭元亨*), who composed *Commentary* (*Shū*); the **Ding** refers to **Ding Wei** (*丁谓*), the **Xu** to **Xu Ang** (*许昂*), the **Zhang** to **Zhang Cha** (*章察*), the **Huang** to **Huang Boshi** (*黄伯思*), and the **Lin** to **Lin Yu**’s edition (*林瑀本*), as stated.\n\nThe **Great Profound** (*Tài Xuán*) aligns with the **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*). In the **Tài Chū Upper Yuan** (*Tài Chū Shàng Yuán*), the **first month of the first year (Jiazi)** (*正月甲子*), on the **new moon and winter solstice** (*shuò dàn dōng zhì*), there is no excess fraction. After **1,539 years** (*hòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*), in the year **Jiachen** (*甲辰*), the new moon and winter solstice again align without excess. Another **1,539 years** (*yòu qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*) returns to the **Jiazi** alignment, without excess.\n\n**Nineteen years** (*shí jiǔ suì*) constitute **one chapter** (*yī zhāng*), and **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*) amount to **513 years** (*wǔ bǎi yī shí sān suì*), forming **one cycle** (*yī huì*). A **cycle** (*huì*) is the completion of the **interaction of sun and moon** (*rìyuè jiāohuì*).\n\n**Eighty-one chapters** (*bā shí yī zhāng*)—**1,539 years** (*qiān wǔ bǎi sān shí jiǔ suì*)—form **one grand cycle** (*yī tǒng*). From **Zi** (*子*) to **Chen** (*辰*), from **Chen** (*辰*) to **Shen** (*申*), and from **Shen** (*申*) back to **Zi** (*子*), these **four grand cycles** (*fàn sì yīuàn*) span **4,617 years** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí yī qiān suì*).\n\nEach **grand cycle** (*tǒng*) contains **three cycles** (*sān huì*), each **cycle** (*huì*) comprises **twenty-seven chapters** (*èr shí qī zhāng*), and **nine cycles** (*jiǔ huì*) complete **one grand cycle** (*yī yuàn*). Within this, **one chapter** exhausts its **intercalary fraction** (*rùn fèn*), **one cycle** completes its **eclipses** (*yuè shí*), **one grand cycle** fulfills its **new moon divisions** (*shuò fèn*), and **one grand cycle** aligns the **six celestial stems** (*liù jiǎ*) and **ten heavenly branches** (*shí zhī*).\n\nThe **Han Calendar** (*Hàn lì*) uses **81** as the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*), with **365 days** (*sān bǎi liù shí wǔ rì*) per year. Multiplying the **day-law** (*rì fǎ*) yields **29,565 fractions** (*èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi liù shí wǔ fèn*), adding **one-fourth of a day** (*yì sì fèn rì zhī yī*), resulting in **20 fractions short** (*èr shí fèn shǎo*), totaling **29,585 fractions short** (*hé èr wàn jiǔ qiān wǔ bǎi bā shí wǔ fèn shǎo*). Dividing by the **twenty-four solar terms** (*èr shí sì qì*), each term receives **1,232 fractions** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn*), with **17 fractions short** (*yú shí qī fèn shǎo*) remaining.\n\nMultiplying by **32** (*sān shí èr*) and **8** (*bā*), the common denominator yields **552** (*wǔ bǎi liù shí èr*). Further division yields **23 seconds** (*èr shí sān miǎo*). Thus, each **solar term** (*qì*) contains **1,232 fractions and 23 seconds** (*yī qiàn èr bǎi sān shí èr fèn èr shí sān miǎo*).\n\nUsing **32** (*sān shí èr*) as the **second-mother** (*miǎo mǔ*), each **verse** (*shǒu*) receives **364 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sān bǎi liù shí sì fèn shí liù miǎo*), and each **ode** (*zàn*) receives **40 fractions and 16 seconds** (*sì shí fèn shí liù miǎo*).\n\nTo determine the **solar term** (*qì*) in which an **ode** (*zàn*) falls: place the **winter solstice** (*dōng zhì*) **solar term**’s fractions and seconds, then subtract the fractions and seconds of the **verse** (*shǒu*). If the remainder is less than the **verse** (*shǒu*), subtract the fractions and seconds of the **ode** (*zàn*). The remaining fractions and seconds, when calculated, yield **Lesser Cold** (*xiǎo hán*).\n\nFor the next **solar term** (*qì*), place the remaining fractions and seconds of the previous term, add the fractions and seconds of the current term, and seek as before. The **star positions** (*xīng*) are as follows:\n\n- **Jiao** (*角*) at **12 degrees** (*shí èr dù*), **Kang** (*亢*) at **9**, **She** (*氏*) at **15**, **Fang** (*房*) at **5**, **Xin** (*心*) at **5**, **Wei** (*尾*) at **18**, **Ji** (*箕*) at **11**—**East** (*dōng*) at **75 degrees** (*qī shí wǔ dù*).\n- **Dou** (*斗*) at **26 degrees** (*èr shí liù dù*), **Niu** (*牛*) at **8**, **Nǚ** (*女*) at **12**, **Xu** (*虚*) at **10**, **Wei** (*危*) at **17**, **Shì** (*室*) at **16**, **Bì** (*壁*) at **9**—**North** (*běi*) at **98 degrees** (*jiǔ shí bā dù*).\n- **Kuí** (*奎*) at **16 degrees** (*shí liù dù*), **Lǚ** (*娄*) at **12**, **Zhuì** (*冑*) at **14**, **Mǎo** (*昴*) at **11**, **Bì** (*毕*) at **16**, **Zī** (*觜*) at **2**, **Shēn** (*参*) at **9**—**West** (*xī*) at **80 degrees** (*bā shí dù*).\n- **Jǐng** (*井*) at **3 + 3 degrees** (*sān + sān dù*), **Guǐ** (*鬼*) at **4**, **Liǔ** (*柳*) at **15**, **Xīng** (*星*) at **7**, **Zhāng** (*张*) at **18**, **Yì** (*翼*) at **18**, **Zhěn** (*轸*) at **17**—**South** (*nán*) at **112 degrees** (*bǎi yī shí èr dù*).\n\n**Quánwěi** (*鹑尾*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Zhang** (*张*) **16 degrees** (*shí liù dù*), marking **Establishing Autumn** (*lì qiū*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Yì** (*翼*) **15 degrees** (*shí wǔ dù*), marking **Processing Heat** (*chǔ shǔ*).\n\n**Shòuxīng** (*寿星*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Zhěn** (*轸*) **12 degrees** (*shí èr dù*), marking **White Dew** (*bái lù*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Jiao** (*角*) **10 degrees** (*shí dù*), marking **Autumnal Equinox** (*qiū fèn*).\n\n**Dàhuǒ** (*大火*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **She** (*氏*) **5 degrees** (*wǔ dù*), marking **Cold Dew** (*hán lù*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Fang** (*房*) **5 degrees** (*wǔ dù*), marking **Frost’s Descent** (*shuāng jiàng*).\n\n**Xīmù** (*析木*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Wei** (*尾*) **10 degrees** (*shí dù*), marking **Establishing Winter** (*lì dōng*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Ji** (*箕*) **7 degrees** (*qī dù*), marking **Lesser Snow** (*xiǎo xuě*).\n\n**Dàliáng** (*大梁*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Wèi** (*胃*) **7 degrees** (*qī dù*), marking **Grain Rain** (*gǔ yǔ*) and **Today’s Clear Brightness** (*jīn rì qīng míng*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Mǎo** (*昴*) **8 degrees** (*bā dù*), marking **Clear Brightness** (*qīng míng*) and **Today’s Grain Rain** (*jīn rì gǔ yǔ*).\n\n**Shíshěn** (*实沈*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Bì** (*毕*) **12 degrees** (*shí èr dù*), marking **Establishing Summer** (*lì xià*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Jǐng** (*井*) **initial** (*chū*), marking **Lesser Fullness** (*xiǎo mǎn*).\n\n**Quánshǒu** (*鹑首*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Jǐng** (*井*) **16 degrees** (*shí liù dù*), marking **Grain in Ear** (*máng zhòng*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Jǐng** (*井*) **31 degrees** (*sān shí yī dù*), marking **Summer Solstice** (*xià zhì*).\n\n**Quánhuǒ** (*鹑火*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Liǔ** (*柳*) **9 degrees** (*jiǔ dù*), marking **Lesser Heat** (*xiǎo shǔ*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Zhāng** (*张*) **3 degrees** (*sān dù*), marking **Greater Heat** (*dà shǔ*).\n\n**Xīngjì** (*星纪*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Dou** (*斗*) **12 degrees** (*shí èr dù*), marking **Greater Snow** (*dà xuě*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Qiánniú** (*牵牛*) **initial** (*chū*), marking **Winter Solstice** (*dōng zhì*).\n\n**Xuángāo** (*玄枵*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Wěinǚ** (*婺女*) **8 degrees** (*bā dù*), marking **Lesser Cold** (*xiǎo hán*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Wei** (*危*) **initial** (*chū*), marking **Greater Cold** (*dà hán*).\n\n**Péngzǐ** (*娵訾*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Wei** (*危*) **16 degrees** (*shí liù dù*), marking **Establishing Spring** (*lì chūn*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Yíngshì** (*营室*) **14 degrees** (*shí sì dù*), marking **Awakening of Insects** (*jīng zhè*) and **Today’s Rain Water** (*jīn rì yǔ shuǐ*).\n\n**Jiànglǚ** (*降娄*):\n- **Initial** (*chū*) at **Kuí** (*奎*) **5 degrees** (*wǔ dù*), marking **Rain Water** (*yǔ shuǐ*) and **Today’s Awakening of Insects** (*jīn rì jīng zhè*); **Middle** (*zhōng*) at **Lǚ** (*娄*) **Western degree** (*xī dù*), marking **Spring Equinox** (*chūn fèn*).\n\nThe **seconds** (*miǎo shù*) being short, the **fractions** (*fèn*) are dispersed into **32** (*sān shí èr*).\n\nTo seek the **star** (*xīng*): place its **host degree** (*sù dù shù*), double it with the **verse** (*shǒu*), and subtract the remainder to find the **ode’s division** (*zàn fèn*) corresponding to the **star’s daily position** (*rì suǒ zhàn sù zhī zàn*).
