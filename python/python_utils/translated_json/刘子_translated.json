The heart is the root of the body. The spirit is the treasure of the heart. Thus, when the spirit is tranquil, the heart is harmonious. When the heart is still, it does not weary the body.\n\nTo inquire into stillness without disturbing one’s nature and emotions is to depart from dust and distance oneself from filth. Thus, when the heavens are clear, the white sun shines; when the river is clear, the sage emerges. When the times are clear, there is great peace; when the waters are clear, the fish leap. When the spirit is clear, there are no burdens; when the heart is clear, the shadow is straight.\n\nThe spirit is the name of profound wisdom. Clarity is the designation of purity. If one can purify the body, then filth will not stain it. If one can still the heart and spirit, the body will suffer no harm. Thus, Confucius said of Boyi and Shuqi that they could be called pure.\n\nWhen the heart is harmonious, the body is whole. When the spirit is restless, the heart is unsettled; when the heart is unsettled, the body is harmed. To preserve the body, one must first order the spirit. Thus, nurturing the spirit with tranquility brings inner peace; dwelling in emptiness and clarity keeps one undisturbed by externals. When the spirit is tranquil and the heart clear, the body is free from burdens.\n\nThe empty room generates brightness—auspiciousness arrives. If the human heart inwardly generates brightness without turbidity, then auspiciousness arrives. Gazing upon that which is not hollow: the empty room generates brightness. If the human heart is empty, then pure brightness arises alone.\n\nSima Biao said: *Que* means emptiness, cessation. People do not reflect in dull metal but in a polished mirror because the polished can illuminate. They do not gaze upon flowing waves but upon still water because stillness can clarify. Mirrors and water, by their nature of clarity, can thus reflect the forms of things.\n\nFrom this, we see: when the spirit is luminous, filth vanishes; when the body is still, the spirit is clear. When filth vanishes, inner desires are forever extinguished; when the spirit is clear, external burdens do not enter.\n\nNow, when a pure song is performed, the heart rejoices. Han E was skilled in singing. Traveling to Qi, she sang as she walked. Arriving at Yongmen, a great snowstorm fell, and her provisions ran out. She wished to sing for food, but the people of Yongmen did not recognize her and struck her with a staff. Han E then wept in sorrow, and those who heard her weeping all grieved and went three days without eating. A wise person said to her: \"You are skilled in singing—you may cease weeping and sing.\" Han E then sang, her voice so clear and resonant it could stir the rafters’ dust. The people of Yongmen, upon hearing it, forgot their meals for three days.\n\nWhen sorrowful sounds arise, the heart is grieved. The spirit dwells in the body, shifting with encounters and influences. From this, we see that the changes of emotion arise from without. If a single sorrow or joy can obstruct the true nature, how much more can the myriad things, with their power to seize and agitate the heart and spirit?\n\nThus, when ten thousand men draw their bows toward one magpie, can the magpie avoid being struck? The magpie is a bird of ill omen, so all aim their arrows at it—a metaphor for the human heart’s myriad distractions, emotions in chaos, the heart unsettled, like the magpie struck by an arrow.\n\nThe myriad things dazzle and confuse, deluding this one life—can life avoid injury? The seven apertures are the doors and windows of the spirit and essence. Will and qi are the envoys and sentinels of the five viscera. The ears and eyes are enticed by sounds and sights; the nose and mouth by fragrances and flavors; the limbs and body by comfort and ease. Their emotions are one, and thus the spirit gallops wildly without restraint. When will and qi are worn down by pursuit and abandonment, the five viscera surge and are not at peace.\n\nDesires extend endlessly without, while the heart’s palace is congested within. Spreading through the waves of excess and dissipation, lingering in the realm of right and wrong—those who do not corrupt their virtue or harm their lives are indeed few.\n\nThus, the sage clears the eyes and does not see, stills the ears and does not hear, closes the mouth and does not speak, abandons the heart and does not ponder. They value the body and forget lowliness, so power and rank cannot move them. In the past, Yao offered the throne to Xu You, who refused and washed his ears in the river. They delight in the Dao and forget poverty, so great wealth cannot sway them. They dwell in contentment, roam in accord with their nature, their qi vast and unobstructed, their innermost being purely bright. Thus, the body is not cultivated, yet nature is preserved; the heart is not wearied, yet the Dao arrives of itself.\n\n**2. *Fangyu* (Guarding Against Desire)**\n\nIn receiving qi, humans necessarily possess emotions and nature. What nature is moved by is emotion. What emotion finds peace in is desire. Desire is the source of esteem and love, the root of extravagance and excess.\n\nThus, Jie of Xia and Xin of Shang perished through desire; Qing Feng and Zhi Bo ruined their houses through desire. All stemmed from failing to guard against the subtle and consider the distant, accumulating small matters into great ones.\n\nThe *Six Secret Teachings* of the Grand Duke says: \"If two leaves are not removed, they will seek the axe’s handle. If a tiny flame is not extinguished, how will one deal with a raging blaze?\" This speaks of not eliminating the small, leading to great disaster.\n\nEmotion arises from nature, yet emotion violates nature. Desire arises from emotion, yet desire harms emotion. Emotion injures nature, nature obstructs emotion—like smoke and waves to water and fire. Smoke is born from fire, yet smoke stifles fire; ice comes from water, yet ice blocks water. Thus, when smoke is faint, fire blazes; when ice floats, water flows. When nature is steadfast, emotion fades; when emotion burns fiercely, nature is destroyed.\n\nThus, when a pearl is lustrous, dust cannot cling to it. When nature is bright, emotions and desires cannot stain it. The nature of the forest is still—what moves it is the wind’s shaking. The nature of water is clear—what muddies it is the soil’s turbidity. The nature of humans is steadfast—what leads them astray is desire’s dazzlement.\n\nThe body’s possession of desire is like a tree’s possession of sapwood. When a tree embraces sapwood, it returns to self-destruction; when the body embraces desire, it returns to self-harm. Thus, when sapwood flourishes, the tree breaks; when desire blazes, the body perishes.\n\nTo restrain emotions and desires, first gather in the five gates. The five gates are the paths of emotions and desires, the storehouses of preferences. The eyes love vibrant colors—called the axe that hews nature. The ears delight in lewd sounds—called the drum that attacks the heart. The mouth craves rich flavors—called the medicine that rots the intestines. Fatty meat and fine wine are the medicine that rots the intestines.\n\nThe nose delights in fragrant scents—called the smoke that chokes the throat. The body luxuriates in carriages and horses—called the mechanism that invites distress.\n\nShu Guang said: \"The poor and lowly constantly long for wealth and nobility, yet wealth and nobility tread upon the precipice of peril.\" Thus, he hung his official cap outside the Eastern Gate of Luoyang, resigned his post, and returned home in old age, with a thousand officials seeing him off. Yu Xin said: \"A thousand officials bid farewell to the Two Shus.\" The Two Shus were the brothers Shu Guang and Shu Shou. Hence it is said: \"The Two Shus perceived the danger, who compelled them to untie their seals?\" The *Book* states: \"Dwelling in favor, think of peril—none fail to stand in awe.\"\n\nThese five are what nourish life, yet also what harm it. The ears and eyes in their relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth in their relation to fragrances and flavors, the flesh and limbs in their relation to ease and comfort—all share the same nature. Yet by them one may die, or by them one may live; one may become wise and virtuous, or one may remain foolish and dull—all depends on how one handles them.\n\nIt is like the fool who tends fish and crows: seeing the cold of winter, he places the fish in warm broth and perches the crows upon a firewood pyre. Water and wood are what nourish fish and crows, yet nurturing them contrary to principle will surely lead to their withering and decay. Colors, sounds, fragrances, and flavors are what delight people, yet delighting in them beyond measure will return to harm life.\n\nThus, the wise dissect their emotions to cast off encumbrances, restrain their desires to preserve their endowment, eat enough to fill the void and sustain qi, wear enough to cover the body and ward off cold. The splendor of extravagance does not disturb their nature; a moment’s fleeting pleasure does not disorder their spirit. They dwell at the spring of contentment, stand upon the shore of harmlessness—this is the Dao of preserving one’s nature.\n\nWhen a bee or wasp stings a finger, the whole day is spent in vexation; when mosquitoes and gnats feast upon the skin, the entire night is lost to sleeplessness. Bees and mosquitoes are minor harms, afflictions of the finger and skin. When people enter the mountains, they avoid bees and wasps; when they enter their chambers, they drive away mosquitoes and gnats. Why? Because they harm the body.\n\nDesires assail the heart, and true nature is overturned. The great harm of desires is an internal affliction of the heart—far greater than the harm to finger or skin. Yet while the harm of external afflictions is lighter than an autumn hair, people know to avoid it; the harm of internal afflictions is heavier than Mount Tai, yet none avoid it. Is this not forsaking a light suffering to bear a heavy one? Is it not perverse?\n\nWhen a man’s oxen or horses wander astray, he knows to retrieve them; yet when his passions and desires run wild, he does not know to rein them in. Is this not delusion? To restrain passions and desires, one must act at their most fragile and subtle. The sprouting of desire is like a tree’s first shoot, like a flame’s first flicker—one may pluck it and break it, extinguish it with a drop of dew. But once it blazes, branches coil into the clouds, flames roar like the towering Chapter Hua.\n\n*Fiao* means fire soaring in flight; *shan* means fire raging. In Chu stood the Chapter Hua Terrace, vast and towering. The King of Chu, fond of valor, set fire to the terrace and ordered his soldiers to extinguish it, promising rewards equal to the spoils of Chen. Thus the soldiers, their bodies smeared with mud, rushed into the flames to save it. Hence it is said: flames *shan-piao* the Chapter Hua Terrace. Though they exhausted their strength wielding axes and drained the ponds to drown the fire, they could not suppress it—so fierce was its power.\n\nWhen desires first stir, the ears and eyes may be sealed and the heart and mind locked; but once they blaze, though one folds away passions and rolls up desires, one cannot contain them—so ruined is one’s nature. If one could block the apertures before desires take shape—\n\n*Dui* means the eyes. Laozi said: \"Block the apertures, close the gates.\" Do not see the allure of desire.\n\n—if one could forbid desires at their most fragile and subtle, though one might seek regret and remorse, could it be attained?\n\n**Abandoning Passions, III**\nPassions are the arbiter of right and wrong, the root of benefit and harm. Passions are the root of benefit and harm, the arbiter of right and wrong. Without passions, things present no doubt; with passions, responses become obstacles. Thus one must abandon them.\n\nWhere there is right, there must be wrong; what can benefit can also harm. Right and wrong, benefit and harm dwell within, and each turns to doubt the other. Therefore, to engage the world without passions is to meet all things with constant harmony; to engage others with passions is to encounter obstacles at every turn. From this we see: where passions reside, things become doubtful.\n\nThus, when a matchmaker praises a man—*Meiyang* was a matchmaker of unknown era—the praised does not take it as virtue. One who forces himself to eat and is thus sated does not take it as kindness. An infant who harms another is not resented by the harmed. A dwarf who mocks another is not shamed by the mocked. Why? Because the matchmaker seeks advantage for himself, and the praised, moved by the benefit of praise, though receiving kindness does not deem it virtue. Without passions toward harm or shame, though slandered, one bears no grudge.\n\nFish do not fear the net but fear the *hong*—the *ti*, the cormorant, also called the *huwu*, a marsh bird. The mighty do not resent the *Suo’ou* and *Moye*—names of famous swords—but resent the one who wields them. The net has no intent, but the bird has passions; the sword has no passions, but the man has intent.\n\nTo have an honest man divide wealth is not as fair as casting lots or drawing straws. When a man divides property, the property moves his feet. To have an incorruptible man guard a treasure is not as secure as sealing it behind locked doors. Why? Because the fairness of one with intent cannot match the impartiality of one without intent.\n\nWhere desire exists in one who is upright, it falls short of the uprightness of one without desire. Now, the human eye may be like that of Li Zhu—Li Zhu, a man of keen sight in the time of the Yellow Emperor, who could see the tip of a rabbit’s fur from a hundred paces away. The heart may be like a balance scale—a balance scale being the steelyard. Yet when one judges another’s beauty or ugliness, even if the words hit the mark, the other will surely resent it. But when one gazes into a bright mirror and sees their own reflection reversed, their ugliness exposed, they may feel shame inwardly yet bear no grudge. The one who judged before and the mirror now seem no different, yet the former is resented while the latter is not. Why? Because the mirror is without intent, while the man has a heart.\n\nWhen three people share a room and two quarrel, they inevitably turn to the one who does not quarrel to judge right and wrong. Yet the one who does not quarrel is not necessarily impartial, nor are the quarreling parties necessarily biased. Why, then, do they trust the one who does not quarrel? Because the hearts of those who quarrel are clouded by their competing passions. When a flying tile strikes someone by chance, though it may wound, one does not grow angry—because the tile has no intent to strike.\n\nThus, the sage abandons cunning to preserve authenticity, sets aside emotion to engage with the world, and does not become the master of fame. *Master* here means one who presides. Though appearing foolish, they do not dwell in the midst of reputation, nor do they make their mind a storehouse of schemes. Without a storehouse of schemes, they remain boundless and unconfined, untouched by worldly burdens.\n\n**Chapter Four: Concealing Radiance**\nAll things in the world never fail to conceal their form and efface their shadow. *Conceal* means to hide. The Grand Duke wrote a book titled *The Six Concealments*: *Dragon Concealment*, *Tiger Concealment*, *Leopard Concealment*, *Human Concealment*, *Swift Steed*, and *Phoenix Concealment*. Zhang Tou said: \"One should conceal their learning to avoid boasting, not to parade themselves.\" They hide their essence in seclusion to preserve their nature and entrust their fate.\n\nThose who harbor rare beauty must conceal their essence and efface their form to seek abundant fortune. Those who parade their uniqueness and flaunt their talents never escape harm to their nature and destruction of their fate. All things in the world delight in adorning themselves with splendor and displaying their finest traits, yet none who reveal their talents avoid injury to their nature.\n\nThus, the kingfisher’s brilliant plumage brings self-destruction—its feathers, vibrant in emerald and azure, prized for ornament, are seized by humankind. The tortoise’s wisdom invites its own ruin—when the sacred tortoise bears the prophetic diagram, people bore and scorch its shell to divine fortune. Cinnabar, for its rich hue, is ground away; jade-bearing stone is shattered for its treasure. These four beings, though born in remote wilds, far removed from humankind, entrust their nature to mountain forests and lodge their spirits beyond the world of things, seeking nothing from others. Yet they bring misfortune upon themselves by failing to conceal their form.\n\nHad the kingfisher withdrawn its wings into the luminous groves of the southern fire-mountains—nine myriad *li* from the Central Kingdom, the phoenix’s domain—it would have forever escaped the peril of plucked feathers. Had the tortoise dragged its tail through the mud of Yang Valley—the valley of the rising sun, where, as the *Book of Documents* says, \"the sun emerges from Yang Valley and illumines all under heaven\"—it would never have known the sorrow of scorching. Had cinnabar hidden its glow in the depths of Spring Mountain—a branch of Jing Mountain, rich in jade and vermilion—its grinding would have ceased forever. Had the stone held fast to the crags of the Dark Garden, the anguish of carving would never have reached it.\n\nThus, the towering catalpa of secluded peaks and winding gorges, born amidst piled boulders, its tip piercing the azure sky, its roots delving into the Yellow Springs, its branches spreading wide, its leaves curling in fantastical whorls—beneath it, unicorns and *lin* beasts frolic; above it, cranes and *luan* birds soar; floating clouds nestle beside it; the pure wind stirs through it. Year after year, it suffers not the slightest harm from axes or blades. Not that it possesses anything coveted by humankind, but that it conceals its essence, thus preserving its nature.\n\nThe elm by the roadside, however—its branches gathered by woodcutters, its boughs felled by carpenters, its last handspan of shoots snapped by passersby—possesses nothing extraordinary. Yet it invites plunder because its form remains exposed. The Zhou rooster, by severing its own tail—when King Wen of Zhou sought to sacrifice a cock with plumage of perfect hue, the bird bit off its tail, rendering it unfit for the altar, and thus escaped death—shows that even cleverness may court disaster.\n\nThe mountain ape, for all its cunning—this nimble creature, skilled at dodging arrows—once, when the King of Chu went hunting, performed tricks in the trees. The king asked his attendants, \"Who is the finest archer?\" They replied, \"Only Yang Youji excels.\" The king summoned Youji, who arrived, adjusted his bowstring, and nocked an arrow. The ape, clinging to the tree, wailed, knowing Youji’s divine aim left no escape; death was certain. From this, the principle of withdrawal and emergence may be understood.\n\nThus, the virtuous of old concealed their traces and veiled their wisdom to seal their exterior, stilled their hearts and sealed their emotions to settle their interior. With the interior settled, the spirit’s storehouse remains undisturbed; with the exterior sealed, the body remains unassailed. Dwelling thus, is one not whole?\n\n**Chapter Five: Exalting Study**\nThe supreme Dao is wordless; without speech, its principles cannot be made clear. The Great Image is formless; without form, its mysteries cannot be fathomed. The subtleties of Dao and Image cannot be conveyed without words. The subtleties of words cannot be transmitted without study. Never has one discerned the Dao without study, nor illuminated the self without its aid.\n\nSilkworms spin their cocoons into thread, woven into fine silk, stitched into garments—kings and lords wear them. Study refines conduct and adorns speech with literary grace, and the world honors it. Without spinning, raw silk rots in baskets; without study, talent and wisdom fester in the heart.\n\nUnopened, the oyster’s bright pearl remains hidden; uncut, the Kun bamboo’s phoenix-like tones remain unheard—when the Yellow Emperor sent Ling Lun to the western valleys of Kunlun Mountain to gather bamboo for pitch-pipes, the bamboo, golden as metal, when blown, produced a sound indistinguishable from the phoenix’s cry. Thus, the phoenix’s voice goes unheard. Unrefined, the spirit’s radiance does not emerge.\n\nConsider metal and wood: metal’s nature harbors water; wood’s nature conceals fire. Smelt metal, and water appears; drill wood, and fire is born. If one devotes oneself to study, drilling and refining one’s nature, talent and wisdom will flourish.\n\nIndigo, drawn from the blue plant, surpasses it in depth; dyeing makes it so. Ice, born of water, surpasses it in clarity; cold makes it so. The mirror, wrought from metal, surpasses it in brightness; polishing makes it so. The children of the Rong and Yi tribes cry alike at birth, yet grow to speak different tongues; teaching makes it so. The Rong dwell in the west, the Yi in the east, their languages distinct. Yet in infancy, their wails are indistinguishable. Only as they mature do their tongues diverge—education and learning make it so.\n\nMountains cradle jade, and grasses and trees flourish; rivers harbor pearls, and their banks never wither. The mouth takes in flavors, and the hundred joints grow robust; the heart receives classics and admonitions, and the five natures flow freely. Without ascending lofty peaks, one does not know the height of heaven; without gazing into deep valleys, one does not know the depth of earth; without traversing the Six Arts, one does not know the source of wisdom.\n\nWhat is distant yet gleams with splendor is adornment; what is near yet grows ever clearer is study. Thus, the stalwart bamboo of Wu—though straight and firm, fit for arrows—without fletching and arrowheads, lacks beauty. The keen blade of Yue—though sharp—without tempering, lacks penetration.\n\nHuman nature is forgetful and dull—without accumulated study, it cannot be perfected. To progress from shallowness to depth, to part the veils and perceive clarity, one cannot rely on hearsay or claim mastery through superficial dabbles in goodness.\n\nHe who returns home sets his heart on seeing his family, yet cannot arrive in a single step. The aspiring scholar, his spirit entwined with classics and plain silk, cannot achieve mastery in a single reading. Thus, one who builds a mountain begins with a basket of earth, yet raises cliffs a thousand fathoms high; one who digs a well starts with a three-inch pit, yet reaches depths of ten thousand spans.\n\nThe spirit-pearl begins no larger than a bean—at first like a tiny legume, it grows to a full inch in diameter, illuminating an entire chamber. When a person engages in study and attains enlightenment, their divine wisdom brightens just so. Though its growth is unseen, over years it becomes vast; though the clapper of a *nao*-bell seems no thicker than a finger—cast in bronze with a wooden tongue—though its wear is imperceptible, over time it snaps.\n\nDripping water from a cliff’s edge will eventually bore through stone; a cart’s wheel, drawn by a rope, will at last sever its axle. Water is no drill for stone, nor is rope a saw for wood—yet the breaking and piercing are the work of gradual accumulation.\n\nThe ear is whole in form yet fails to hear—this is deafness; the eye is complete in form yet fails to see—this is blindness. Human nature is fine, yet without reflection—this is the fault of one who does not study the Dao. When the ear first dulls or the eye first dims, one does not realize the value of a hundred gold coins or seek a physician from a thousand miles away. A person who does not pursue learning is like one whose heart is deaf and blind, unaware of the need to seek a wise teacher from afar to dispel the obstructions of the mind and safeguard the integrity of their nature.\n\nThus, when Master Xuan of Lu lay dying, his hands did not release the scroll; when Zhongshu neared death, his mouth did not cease recitation. Dong Zhongshu of Guangchuan, who lowered his curtains to read, did not glance at his garden for seven years, nor saw his brothers face-to-face; for three years, he did not know whether his horse was male or female. As for Master You, who hated lying abed—he struck his own palm to stay awake.\n\nReading scrolls, one hates sleep—thus he struck his own palm to pieces. Scholar Su, troubled by drowsiness, pierced his thigh with an awl. Even those of sagely and worthy nature remain tireless in learning; how then could a lowly servant or laborer dare to rest?\n\n**Chapter Six: Devoted Study**\nStudy arises from the heart, for the heart governs the body. The heart is endowed with the Five Constants, yet its desires vary: some scheme over classics and histories, others cherish zither and calligraphy. At times, one yearns for worldly pursuits; suddenly, one craves tranquility—all stems from the heart. Thus, all proceeds from the heart.\n\nThe ears and eyes attend to the external, yet if the heart is not fixed on study, one hears no litigation, sees no text. To refine one’s work, one must first rectify the heart, that principles and righteousness may enter therein.\n\nTwo leaves cover the eyes—\nThe eyes govern sight, the ears govern hearing.\nWith two leaves covering the eyes, nothing is seen;\nthus, all becomes dark and silent.\nTwo pearls plug the ears—\nThe ears govern sound; if two pearls block them,\nthen all falls into stillness and silence.\n\nLeaves become the eyes’ veil, pearls the ears’ obstruction; when these two gates are barred from without, sight is cut off within, hearing severed. The heart resides within, things lie without. The eyes see no color, the ears hear no sound—bereft of sight and hearing, the heart is isolated within. Thus it is said: sight and hearing are inwardly blocked. This is only fitting.\n\nYet Li Lou, who could discern the tip of an autumn hair at a hundred paces—\n*(Li Lou was a man of the Yellow Emperor’s time, whose eyes were so keen he could see an autumn hair’s end from a hundred paces away. An autumn hair is the fine tip of a rabbit’s fur.)*\n—could not hear the crash of thunder. Ji Zi, who could hear the pure notes of the *qingjiao* melody, could not perceive the form of Mount Song or Mount Tai.\n\nJi Zi was a prince of Wu, skilled in distinguishing musical tones and discerning through music whether a state would endure or perish. *Qingjiao* is a woodwind tone, a sound of harmony and nurturance. When this tone is present in music, the state enjoys peace; if absent, the state will fall. Ji Zi, entering a foreign land to listen for this tone in its music, focused his mind entirely upon his ears, neglecting his eyes—thus he could not perceive the forms of Mount Song or Mount Tai.\n\nSight does not pertain to hearing, nor do the ears see; the eyes govern vision, and the ears cannot see. When the mind is wholly fixed upon the eyes, it forgets the ears, and hearing fails. Why then does hearing not pertain to sight, nor do the eyes hear? The ears govern hearing, and the eyes cannot hear. When the mind is wholly fixed upon the ears, it forgets the eyes, and sight fails—this is because the mind cannot serve two purposes at once. When the mind is submerged in the tip of an autumn hair or absorbed in the *qingjiao* melody, this is the reason.\n\nLi Lou, when applying his mind, neglected his ears; when using his ears, he neglected his mind. To be \"submerged in mind\" is to be engrossed in seeing and hearing. Thus, when the mind is fixed upon the eyes, it must forget the ears, and hearing fails; when the mind is fixed upon the ears, it must neglect the eyes, and sight fails.\n\nIf one attempts to draw a square with the left hand and a circle with the right, commanding both to be completed at once—though the mind wields the compass and square, and the hands trace their forms (a *duo* is a square knife, like today’s carving tool; a *jue* is a round knife, like today’s curved engraving blade, resembling a compass. The compass draws circles, the square draws squares)—though the hands hold the tools of square and circle, they cannot execute both at once. Some say *Jurang* was a swift runner of the Yellow Emperor’s time, commonly called *Jurang Lüji*. Yet he could not do so because the mind cannot serve two purposes, and thus the hands cannot move in tandem.\n\nYi Qiu was the finest player of *yi* in the land. Yi Qiu was the name of an ancient master of the game; because of his skill in *bo* and *yi*, he took *yi* as his surname. When absorbed in thought during a game, if someone passed by playing the *sheng*, he would momentarily listen—and thus lose the game. This was not because his grasp of *yi* was shallow, but because his attention was divided, and the *sheng* disrupted it. *Hua* means to confuse or deceive.\n\nLi Shou was the finest calculator in the world. When a wild swan flew past, he bent his bow to aim, and in the moment between drawing and releasing, if asked to multiply three by five, he could not answer. This was not because three times five was difficult to calculate, but because his mind was obscured, and the swan disrupted it.\n\nYi Qiu’s *yi* and Li Shou’s calculations could plumb the subtlest depths and exhaust all numbers without error. Yet when their minds were on the *sheng* or the swan, they lost the game—this is because the mind was not single-minded but wandered to external affairs.\n\nThe blind have no eyes, yet their ears cannot perceive with precision, for they are wholly devoted to hearing. The turtle has no ears, yet its eyes can \"hear\" through sight, for it is wholly devoted to seeing. Though the blind and the turtle are small creatures, their hearing and sight are keen—this is because they apply their minds with singular focus.\n\nThe cicada is difficult to catch, yet one may seize it as swiftly as a knife’s slash. *Duo* means swift. When Confucius traveled to Chu, he saw a man catching cicadas with a sticky pole, snatching them as if grabbing them. Confucius said, \"How skillful! How skillful!\"\n\nThe *juan’er* is easy to gather, yet it does not fill even a shallow basket—this is the difference between single-mindedness and distraction. The queen consort sighed, saying, \"If only I could find a noble man to govern the state together.\" Yet she forgot the rites of sacrifice in her preoccupation—here too, the distinction between focus and distraction is evident. Thus, the learner must devote themselves with diligence and single-mindedness to enter the realm of the numinous. If the mind is not engaged in study yet one forces recitation, though the words enter the ear, they do not settle in the heart. It is like a deaf man singing, mimicking others without true joy—though the sound leaves his mouth, it scatters and dissipates.\n\n*End of Scroll One of Liuzi*\n*Scroll Two of Liuzi*\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Registrar of Bozhou*\n\n**On Music, Chapter Seven**\n\nMusic is the voice of Heaven and Earth, the principle of harmony and balance. It consists of the five notes, their rhythms alternating between slow and swift, requiring the attainment of a harmonious sound. It is something human nature cannot do without. When the human heart rejoices, it smiles; when it smiles, it delights; when it delights, the mouth longs to sing. Joy gives rise to song and dance. In song, one chants the lyrics and spreads them through sound; in dance, one moves the body and follows the melody. The singer harmonizes with the instruments, though the lyrics vary in number, and the music adapts to the changing verses—hence the term \"song lyrics,\" now also called \"elegant songs.\" The hands long to play, the feet to dance. Song and dance manifest in sound and form: one listens to the song’s melody and observes the dance’s movements. Form arises from motion and stillness, entering the supreme Dao. Sound and stillness, the transformations of human nature, find their fullest expression here.\n\nThus, humans cannot be without music, and music cannot be without form; form cannot be without the Dao, and the Dao cannot be without disorder. The former kings despised such disorder. Master Kuang, through repeated singing, knew that the *Southern Wind* would not prevail; Ji Zha, by listening to music, foresaw the imminent fall of the state of Chen. By examining the tones of *gong* and *shang* and scrutinizing the pitch, once the five notes were established and ceased, they did not allow the hands to grow restless, lest wanton sounds arise and disrupt the proper tones. The former kings, loathing such disorder, created elegant music to guide the people. When a piece concluded, if the hands grew restless and did not stop, wanton sounds emerged. Proper tones constituted elegant music; restless hands and chaotic sounds became wanton music. Wanton music is the sound of a fallen state and a disordered age. Thus, they created elegant music to guide the people, ensuring its sound was sufficient for joy yet not excessive; its melody was orderly yet not deceptive. (Deceptive means false.)\n\nThe former kings established music with defined limits. Thus, music has the five notes, with tempos ranging from slow to swift, progressing from beginning to end, their rhythms alternating to achieve a harmonious sound. Once the piece concluded, they ceased. When the five notes were complete and harmony achieved, they withdrew, refusing to play further and produce wanton sounds. Hence it is said: if the five notes do not cease, it is not proper sound; if the hands grow restless without end, discordant sounds arise. Discordant sounds are those of Zheng and Wei—these are the sounds of a fallen state and a disordered age. Thus, it is said: let the sound be harmonious, the melody orderly yet not deceptive; let the piece be intricate yet refined and balanced.\n\nThe early Confucians said: \"Intricate\" means excessive; \"refined\" means concise; \"balanced\" means restrained. Music has wanton music and elegant music. Those who create it must discern and recognize them, ensuring the melody is orderly yet not deceptive, the musical sounds coherent and structured, arranged without deceit. If the sounds are overly intricate, they must be reduced. They should be made concise, balanced, and even, for music moves the human heart toward good or evil, distinguishes the noble from the base, establishes hierarchy, transforms human nature, and shifts customs. Each dance has its own prescribed movements. Thus, when dance is referred to as \"pattern,\" it is not called \"dance\" outright. This is how music influences human goodness or wickedness, preventing the heart from straying into depravity—such was the intent of the former kings in establishing music.\n\nThe Five Emperors ruled in different eras and did not inherit one another’s music. The former kings danced *Cloud Gate* to worship Heaven, *Xianchi* to sacrifice to Earth, *Shao* to honor the Four Directions, *Great Xia* to venerate the mountains and rivers, *Great Huo* to offer to the ancestral mothers, and *Great Martial* to present to the ancestors. The Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Yao, and Shun—these are the Five Emperors. The Three Kings lived in different ages and did not follow one another’s rites. Xia, Yin, and Zhou—these are the later Three Kings. Each modeled their achievements and virtues, adapting to the changes of their times.\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor’s music was called *Cloud Gate*—it signified his sagely virtue emerging like clouds from a gate. Zhuanxu’s was called *Five Stalks*—his virtue extended to all things, possessing roots and stems. Emperor Ku’s was called *Six Blossoms*—his virtue embraced all things, bearing their finest essence. Yao’s was called *Xianchi*—*xian* means \"all,\" *chi* means \"to spread,\" signifying his sagely virtue pervading the world. Shun’s was called *Shao*—*xiao* means \"reverent,\" indicating his moral character was solemn and respectful. *Shao* also means \"to continue,\" signifying Shun’s ability to inherit Yao’s great merits. The *Book of Documents* states: \"When the *Shao* was played nine times, the phoenix came in response.\" The above refers to the Five Emperors.\n\nYu’s music was called *Great Xia*—*xia* means \"great,\" signifying Yu’s ability to expand upon the virtues of Yao and Shun, his virtue as vast as the heavens, his toil for the people beyond measure, like a great hall’s roof sheltering the people. Tang’s was called *Great Huo*—his virtue was vast, saving the common people and eradicating tyranny; he also protected and nurtured them, spreading his care across the world. Thus, it was called *Great Huo*. King Wu’s was called *Great Martial*—he pacified the world through martial prowess, hence his music was named *Great Martial*. These Three Kings, together with the preceding eight dynasties, each followed different heavenly principles, their reforms distinct, their music reflecting the rise of their times. Their states were governed without imitation—this is why the eight types of music bear different names. The former kings listened to the five notes and played the eight sounds...\n\nSpreading means extending, for dance serves as the foundation while sound and voice are layered upon it. In Lu, songs were performed in the hall while dances took place in the courtyard; the music bells preceded the song, which then led to the dance. First came the recitation of the poems, followed by the various musical pieces. When dances were held in the hall, they were called songs—such was the nature of their dance melodies.\n\nThis was not merely to delight the heart or sate the ears with their resonant tones, but to align with the forms of Heaven and Earth, to fulfill the natures of the myriad things, to harmonize the emotions of the twelve pitch-pipes, and to regulate the qi of yin and yang. The twelve pitch-pipes correspond to the twelve months, blending the rhythms of the eight winds. The five degrees of sound all harmonize with the winds of the eight directions, balancing the production of the eight tones. Each has its rhythm and constant measure; the notes they preserve have their proper divisions, each maintaining its proper order.\n\nThey connect the divisions of the Nine Songs—music has nine performances, beginning with the metal instruments. \"Metal\" refers to bells and chimes. When the people of Jin performed music, they first sang the *Sìxià* as the opening, then struck the metal instruments, followed by the song of King Wen’s music. The nine performances are the Nine *Xià*. The Nine *Xià* are the names of melodies: *Wángxià*, *Zhāoxià*, *Nàxià*, *Zhāngxià*, *Qíxià*, *Zúxià*, *Jīngxià*, *Shǎnxià*, and *Sìxià*. When the king departs, *Wángxià* is played. When armies meet, *Sìxià* is played. When sacrificial animals are led out, *Zhāoxià* is played. When guests arrive from the four directions, *Nàxià* is played. When ministers render merit, *Zhāngxià* is played. When the lady assists in the sacrifice, *Qíxià* is played. When clansmen attend and serve, *Zúxià* is played. When the duke departs, *Jīngxià* is played. When intoxicated guests depart, *Shǎnxià* is played. These are the nine performances, also called the Nine Songs or Nine Completions. Thus it is said: \"The *Xiāosháo* is completed nine times.\"\n\nWhen performed at the Circular Mound—the sacrifice to Heaven at the Circular Mound, a structure of piled earth shaped in a circle, hence its name—the divine spirits descend. The Circular Mound now lies in the southern suburbs of the capital.\n\nWhen performed at the Square Marsh—the sacrifice to Earth at the Square Marsh, a structure of piled earth shaped in a square, hence its name, now located in the northern suburbs of the capital—the hidden spirits of the earth ascend. The luminous are the spirits of Heaven; the hidden, the spirits of Earth. The sounding stones are struck, the hundred beasts lead the dance, and when the music concludes its nine completions—nine completions meaning nine performances—then auspicious birds take flight. Above, it moves Heaven and Earth; below, it transforms customs and mores. Such is the resonance of virtuous sound, the essence of refined music, the music of flourishing power.\n\nThe Zhou, Lu, and Shang all possessed flourishing power—these were the flourishing powers of the Zhou, Lu, and Shang. After the enlightened king passed, customs declined, refined music fell into ruin, and the enlightened king was the Duke of Zhou. By the time of Duke Ai of Lu, rites and music had decayed, musicians scattered and fled, each going their separate ways. In ancient times, the Son of Heaven and the feudal lords all had music performed at their meals, each with their own musicians.\n\nThe Grand Master, named Zhi, was the first musician to perform at meals; he fled to Qi. The Second Meal Musician, Gan, was the second to perform; he fled to Chu. Liao, the third to perform, fled to Cai. Que, the fourth to perform, fled to Qin. Fang Shu, skilled in drumming, went to the region of the Yellow River. Bo Tao Wu, adept at shaking the *tao* drum, was named for it and went to dwell within the Han River. The Junior Master, named Yang, skilled in striking the chime stones and also called Xiang, together fled to the Eastern Sea. As the generations’ rites collapsed and music crumbled, all the musicians departed. And so, degenerate sounds arose in competition.\n\nDegenerate sounds are excessive. Man is yang; woman is yin. As woman ever follows man, she becomes a thing of the yang household. It is said that when one indulges in sensory pleasures, qi may exceed its proper measure—yin in excess chills yang, while excess itself generates heat through the woman’s yang nature. Thus it is said that heat gives rise to six kinds of illness. This affliction is like *gu* poison: the mind and will grow disordered, consciousness fades, and one’s nature is lost. It is called *gu* illness, causing a person to drown in feminine allure, losing their ordinary nature—just as one who sinks into water is said to drown. To be entangled in desire is likewise akin to drowning. Hence excess and drowning are spoken of together.\n\nThus, in the time of Xia Jie, the \"Song of the Shattered Axe\" was composed. When Xia Jie ruled, the Son of Heaven made the \"Song of the Shattered Axe,\" which laments: \"Alas! All lives are lost!\" This marked the beginning of eastern sounds. Eastern sounds belong to the wood phase of the east, governed by the *jue* tone. The *jue* tone is harmonious and nurturing, a sound that cultivates nature and fosters growth.\n\nKing Zhou of Yin composed the decadent *mimi* music. King Zhou was the tyrant Zhou Xin. *Mimi* was the name of a song for endless nights—this was the designation of the wanton music of the Jie and Zhou dynasties, marking the beginning of northern sounds. Northern sounds were the licentious music of King Zhou.\n\nThe customs of Zheng and Wei favored excess, giving rise to songs like \"Qin and Wei\" and \"Sangzhong.\" The Qin and Wei were two rivers between the states of Zheng and Wei. *Sangzhong* was a place of royal debauchery; the king’s depravity influenced the people, leading men and women of the two states to meet in wild unions in the fields. As the *Book of Songs* says: \"Await me in Sangzhong, summon me at Shangguan, escort me to the banks of the Qi.\"\n\nThe customs of Chu and Yue favored valor, giving rise to songs of leaping into boiling water and treading upon fire. The King of Chu loved courage: he set fire to the Ganquan Palace and ordered his soldiers to extinguish the flames as if in battle, rewarding the successful and punishing the failures. The soldiers, their bodies smeared with mud, rushed to fight the fire, and over three thousand perished in the flames.\n\nEach sings of what they cherish, lamenting what they desire to do. Such lamentation verges on sorrow.\n\nThis is sorrow without grief, yet those who hear it weep. For what the heart feels manifests in sound, and what sound stirs must flow into the heart. Thus, when the heart is moved by sorrow or joy, the tones of *qiao* and *sha*, *bi* and *huan* arise, and the melodies of the Pu River emerge. When King Zhou of Shang acted without the Dao, his court musician embraced his zither and cast himself into the Pu River to die. A musician of Wei named Shi Juan passed by the Pu River and heard music upon its waters. He listened and transcribed it, and upon reaching Jin, he composed this piece. The Jin court musician Shi Kuang said to the king: \"This is the music of the Pu River—music of a fallen state.\" Thereafter, it was abandoned and never played again. Such sounds give rise to licentious, reckless, and dissolute impulses.\n\nThus, when Yan Nian composed the song of the city-toppling beauty, Emperor Wu of Han longed for languid, seductive charm. *Miman* refers to bewitching allure. Yan Nian was Li Yan Nian, a man of striking beauty. Emperor Wu took him as a consort and appointed him Commandant of Harmonizing Pitch. The emperor ordered him to create new music, and so Yan Nian rose to dance and sang:\n*\"In the southern lands there is a fair one,\nWhose beauty is like jade.\nOne glance topples a city,\nA second glance topples a kingdom.\nIf a kingdom’s fall is no regret,\nSuch a beauty cannot be found again.\"*\nThe emperor doted on him and asked his attendants: \"Is there another beauty in the world like this?\" They replied: \"Yan Nian has a younger sister, peerless in grace and unmatched in beauty.\" The emperor summoned her at once, and finding her incomparably lovely, took her as his lady. The people of the time said: \"One male, one female, a pair flying into the purple palace.\"\n\nWhen Yongmen played the tune of the pines, Duke Min of Qi mourned his unfinished mourning robes. Yongmen was a musician of Qi who played for the duke the melody *\"Autumn Wind Enters the Pine Bridge,\"* its notes piercingly mournful. As he played, the duke shivered, thinking of the robes he had yet to complete.\n\nWhen Jing Ke entered Qin, Song Yi struck the *zhu* and sang by the Yi River. Jing Ke, a man of Wei, went to Qin with Prince Dan of Yan to avenge him, intending to assassinate the King of Qin. As he departed at the Yi River, the prince saw him off. Song Yi played the *zhu*, and Jing Ke drew his sword and sang:\n*\"The wind howls, the Yi River runs cold,\nA hero departs, never to return.\"*\nThe song moved heaven, and a white rainbow pierced the sun. Though he failed to kill the King of Qin and perished in the Qin palace, he never returned. Those who heard it glared in fury, their hair bristling through their caps.\n\nWhen King Qian of Zhao was exiled to Fangling—King Wu, son of King Ling, banished for his crimes to the land of Fangling—his heart longed for his homeland. He composed the *\"Mountain and Water Hinge,\"* singing as he sat by day and chanting as he walked by night. His song went:\n*\"The mountain has trees,\nThe trees have branches.\nMy heart longs for you, my lord—\nDoes my lord know?\"*\nThose who heard it choked with sobs, their tears flowing unchecked.\n\nAll these are sounds of dissipation, sorrow, indignation, and bitter lament—music not of reason, harmony, or virtuous power. When Emperor Huan of Han heard the zither of Chu, he sighed with deep emotion, his heart aching with sorrow. The *zither of Chu* was a melody filled with the plaintive songs of Chu women. As Emperor Huan listened, he was overcome by its mournful, desolate tones. He said: \"How excellent! If music can be like this, is it not joy?\" But music should be sound that harmonizes the heart, not this. Now the sound is sorrowful, the heart grieving, tears flowing as songs are offered—this is taking sorrow as joy. If sorrow is taken as joy, what joy remains?\n\nToday, resentful and mournful sounds are set to pipes and strings. Those who hear them are either led astray or plunged into grief. To be led astray is to confuse the distinction between men and women; to grieve is to be moved by sounds of resentment. How can this be called music? Thus, depraved sounds stir people, and perverse *qi* responds; perverse *qi* takes form, and licentious music arises. Upright sounds stir people, and harmonious *qi* responds; harmonious *qi* takes form, and balanced music arises. If music is not harmonious, *qi* becomes stagnant; when *qi* stagnates, hearts grow perverse, deceitful, and false, giving rise to reckless and wanton deeds.\n\nTherefore, depraved sounds and seductive sights do not linger in the wise; lewd sounds and corrupt rites do not touch the heart’s cultivation. Only the essence of refined music brings harmony to the heart without disorder.\n\nThus, odes and hymns express the will, bells and drums regulate the ear, feathers and banners govern the eye. Those who listen do not incline toward excess; those who watch do not stray into depravity. When ears and eyes are not inclined or led astray, perverse sounds cannot enter; when perverse sounds do not enter, the nature and emotions harmonize within; when nature and emotions harmonize within, only then is there true music.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Treading Faithfully**\nFaith is the foundation of conduct; conduct is the root of a person. Without faith, a person cannot stand. Thus it is said: \"Abandon food, but preserve faith.\" The *Analects* says: \"If a person lacks faith, I do not know how they can be of use.\" A person cannot be complete without conduct; conduct cannot stand without faith. Thus, faith in a person is like a boat needed to cross a river; faith in conduct is like the oar needed to row the boat. To cross a great river, how can one do without a boat? To sail a square vessel, how can one do without an oar? Now, though one may wish to do good, without knowing how to establish conduct, it is like crossing a river without a boat. Though one may wish to establish conduct, without knowing how to establish faith, it is like rowing a boat without an oar. This is like one who sets out for Ying but heads toward Mount Ming—Ying lies in the south, Mount Ming in the north—turning away from the path, ever more distant.\n\nSince ancient times, all must die, but without faith, a person cannot stand. Thus, even the *pig and fish* are reached by faith. The *pig and fish* refer to the *Zhong Fu* hexagram in the *Book of Changes*, which governs faith. When this hexagram appears in divination, promises are kept, and hunts yield their quarry. Thus, it is the master of faith. How true this is!\n\nFaith is the foundation of all speech. Duke Huan of Qi did not betray the covenant at Cao Ju; Duke Wen of Jin did not abandon his oath to besiege Yuan. When Duke Wen of Jin led his troops to attack the Yuan clan, he ordered each soldier to carry three days’ rations, vowing to retreat once the provisions were exhausted. After encircling the city of Yuan for three days, the defenders still refused to surrender. Duke Wen prepared to withdraw, but a deserter from the city reported: “The city’s supplies are exhausted; they will surrender by dawn. You may remain to accept their surrender.” Duke Wen replied: “I made a pact with my soldiers to retreat when the rations were gone. If I do not withdraw now, I break my word. To gain a city at the cost of faith is not what I will do.” He then ordered the army to return. Upon hearing this, the people of Yuan surrendered of their own accord. From then on, the feudal lords submitted to Jin, all because of the faith shown in the siege of Yuan.\n\nWu Qi did not renege on his reward for moving the axle. Wu Qi, a general of Wei, wished to attack Qin but feared his soldiers lacked trust in him. He buried a chariot axle at the eastern gate of the market and posted a notice: “Whoever can move this axle to the western gate will be granted a hundred *mu* of land, a hundred *jin* of gold, and a house.” For three days, no one dared to move it. Wu Qi then amended the notice: “Whoever moves it will receive five hundred *mu* of land, five hundred *jin* of gold, and a house.” A man came forward and moved the axle, and Wu Qi rewarded him as promised. Later, when he summoned his troops to attack Qin, they achieved victory. This is what it means to not break one’s promise for moving the axle.\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei did not break his appointment with the forester. The forester was the official in charge of mountains and marshes. Marquis Wen had arranged to go hunting with him the next day. On the appointed morning, a heavy rain fell, and his attendants urged him to cancel. The marquis said: “I am not so eager for game that I would break my word to the forester.” He then braved the rain to keep the appointment. Through such conduct, his virtue shone across the heavens and earth, and his name flowed through past and present without blemish.\n\nThus, in spring, the wind must be true—if the wind is unfaithful, flowers and buds will not flourish, and the virtue of generation will fail. In summer, the heat must be true—if the heat is unfaithful, plants and trees will not grow, and the virtue of growth will fail. In autumn, the rain must be true—if the rain is unfaithful, the hundred grains will not ripen, and the virtue of harvest will fail. In winter, the cold must be true—if the cold is unfaithful, water and earth will not solidify, and the virtue of tranquility will fail. If even the numinous powers of heaven and earth, when the seasons are unfaithful, suffer the collapse of the four virtues, how much more so for man?\n\nLong ago, when Qi attacked Lu, it demanded the *Cen* tripod. The Lord of Lu falsely offered another tripod and proposed an alliance. The Lord of Qi, distrustful, sent Liu Ji to verify its authenticity, for Liu Ji was a man of unshakable faith in Lu. Lu then dispatched Liu Ji. Liu Ji said: “You regard the tripod as the foundation of your state, but faith is the foundation of my state. If I destroy my state’s foundation to preserve yours, it is a task I cannot undertake.” He then presented the true *Cen* tripod.\n\nWhen the minor state of She sought refuge in Lu, Lu sent Zilu to negotiate, demanding that She’s lord swear no oath. Zilu declined. Jisun said to him: “A state of a thousand chariots distrusts its own oath but trusts your single word—why do you refuse?” Zilu replied: “If they do not act as vassals yet expect me to guarantee their word, it is unrighteous. I cannot do it.”\n\nLiu Ji and Zilu were mere commoners of Lu, yet their faith stood firm at the crossroads, and their reputations resounded throughout the world. Thus, Qi and She did not trust the oaths of thousand-chariot states but revered the words of these two men. How great is the virtue of faith!\n\nDuke Xiao of Qin sent Shang Yang to attack Wei. Wei dispatched Prince Ang to intercept and resist him. Shang Yang said to Prince Ang: “In the past, you and I were friends. Now, as leaders of two states, I cannot bear to attack you. Let us share a drink to rest our armies.” Prince Ang agreed, and they met. Shang Yang had hidden soldiers ambush and capture him, then crushed Wei’s army. When King Hui later ascended the throne, he suspected Shang Yang of deceit and had him torn apart by chariots in the marketplace. Shang Yang was a pillar minister of Qin, his name esteemed throughout the realm, yet he coveted the petty gain of treachery and lost the great principle of sincerity. Once faithless, he was reproached for life, ultimately meeting destruction and becoming a laughingstock for all under heaven. Is not the harm of faithlessness grave?\n\nThus, words must match deeds—this is the seal of faith. When words are the same but faith precedes them, faith lies before speech; when teachings are the same but sincerity lies beyond them, sincerity exists outside words. The noble person knows the value of sincerity and faith, and thus acts with unwavering trust. In command and movement, in stillness and action, he does not lose the seal of his word. Through this, his teachings stand firm, his governance is upright, his far-reaching influence gathers others, and his rewards and punishments are clear. From this, we see that faith as conduct is of great virtue.\n\n**Thought and Compliance, Ninth**\n\nThe seven luminaries align in order to illuminate the celestial patterns; the celestial patterns show the five stars like strung pearls and the sun and moon like joined jade disks. The five natures follow principle to perfect human conduct. Conduct is beautiful when it embodies compliance, for beauty lies in compliance. When man errs, his error lies in defiance. Thus, if the seven luminaries defy their course, the celestial patterns change; if the five natures defy principle, the human Dao collapses. That such changes do not bring disaster, or such collapse does not harm conduct, has never been known.\n\nWhen mountains and seas contend for water, the water must flow to the sea—not because the sea seeks it, but because the current is compliant. The *Qian* hexagram indicates advantage in the southeast. *Qian* is a hexagram in the *Book of Changes*: Kan above, Gen below, called *Jian*. Gen is mountain, Kan is water. Water upon a mountain is unstable, hence it is called *Qian*. The southeast is the terrain—its nature is low, while the northwest is high. Water naturally flows downward, following the terrain, and thus complies. If one divines and obtains this hexagram, it is auspicious to travel southeast. Therefore, compliance means not acting against the current. Settling on land is compliance; traveling northeast is defiance, for climbing mountains is contrary. Thus, avoiding dampness and seeking dryness is the nature of fire.\n\nAvoiding heights and following low ground is the nature of water. If one guides a spring toward a ravine, it becomes an easily descending flow; if one forces waves to surge against mountains, it must become a difficult ascent. Though water is without sentiment, it still knows to shun opposition and seek compliance—how much more should the human heart? Thus, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are the compliance of virtue; defiance, arrogance, and rudeness are the opposition of virtue. Compliance is the gate of blessing; opposition is the repository of misfortune. From this, one may clearly recognize the difficulty of opposing nature and the ease of following it.\n\nConsider Meng Shuo, a mighty warrior of King Zhou’s time, who pulled an ox by its tail: the tail snapped, the knees split, and he could not advance ten paces. Yet if one threads a mulberry branch through the ox’s nose, smooths it with a length of silk, and lets a bareheaded boy ride and prod it, the beast may gallop across vast marshes, free to go wherever it pleases. Why? Ten paces are no farther than the broad marsh, and the bareheaded boy is no mightier than Meng Shuo—yet the near cannot match the far, the strong cannot surpass the weak, for one is opposition and the other compliance.\n\nSima Ji amassed all the world’s attacks as a swordsman. If one grasps the sword by its blade and brandishes its edge, one must sever one’s fingers and yet fail to pierce rotten wood or dent iron armor. But if one grips the hilt and wields the blade, even an ordinary man may cleave rhinoceroses and elephants on land, or sever dragons in water. Acting in accord with principle is like grasping the hilt; acting against one’s nature is like grasping the blade—can one hope to avoid injuring one’s hand?\n\nThough Hou Ji excelled at sowing and planting, he could not make crops grow in winter, for that opposes the seasons. Though Yu excelled at controlling floods, he drilled through mountains and tunnels, yet rivers could not be made to flow westward, for that opposes the terrain. Though one’s talents and skills may be outstanding, one cannot act contrary to reason and succeed, for that opposes the human Way. Thus, following principle and abiding by nature, even a fool may establish a name; pursuing what is contrary to the Dao, even the wise and sagely will encounter misfortune.\n\nIf a noble person can practice loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, tread sincerity, and contemplate compliance, Heaven will aid them with good fortune, and nothing will be inauspicious.\n\n**Vigilance in Solitude (Chapter Ten)**\n\nGoodness is the sum of conduct and cannot be departed from even for a moment. If it can be departed from, it is not true goodness. A person’s need for goodness is like the head’s need for a cap or the feet’s need for shoes. A head without a cap is uncouth; walking without shoes is barbaric. If one cultivates goodness when in the open but commits wrongs in secret, it is like donning cap and shoes at dawn but going barefoot and bareheaded by dusk.\n\nThe fragrant *acorus* does not cease its fragrance because it grows alone in rocky seclusion; the hidden spring does not lose its clarity because it flows in a secluded ravine. How can a person, in darkness and obscurity, alter their conduct because no one sees? Thus, one must be vigilant where the eye does not see and fearful where the ear does not hear. At home, one should act as if in the presence of guests; in an empty room, as if someone were there.\n\nThe lotus does not change its nature when night falls—this illustrates how the hundred kings upheld ritual without alteration. Lian Huan rode in a carriage at night, and when passing the gate of the Lord of Wei, he dismounted, bowed to the gate, and proceeded. The Lord of Wei, hearing this from within, rode to the gate but did not hear the sound of the carriage. He said, “This must be Lian Huan.” Yan Hui did not alter his demeanor even when bathing at night. When Goujian was imprisoned in the stone chamber, he and his minister maintained the rites of lord and subject without change. When Ji Que plowed in the wilds, he and his wife did not neglect their mutual respect. (Ji Que was a farmer of Jin; beyond the suburbs is the outskirts, beyond the outskirts is the wilds, beyond the wilds is the forest, and beyond the forest is the open country. When Ji Que plowed in the open country and his wife brought him food, he treated her with the courtesy due a guest, without lapse.)\n\nAll these exemplify vigilance in solitude. They abided in goodness even in hidden and subtle circumstances, not altering their hearts because no one saw or changing their disposition because no one heard. Heaven may be high, yet its hearing is near; the sun may be distant, yet its light is close; the divine may be obscure, yet its scrutiny is clear.\n\nAs the *Book of Songs* says:\n*Though you are in your chamber, do not act as if unseen in the hidden corner.*\n(The northwest corner is called the \"hidden corner.\")\n*Do not say, \"It is not manifest,\" for nothing escapes my gaze.*\n\nDark and obscure deeds are never truly hidden; confused and deluded actions are never truly concealed. If one cultivates integrity in the open but acts perversely in secret, thinking no one knows—if people do not know, the spirits do; if the spirits do not know, one knows oneself. To claim ignorance is the folly of the bell thief covering his ears.\n\nConfucius’s disciple rose early each morning to diligently practice goodness. Dongping, in his chamber, took delight in goodness. (Dongping was named Cang.) When asked, “What brings you joy?” he replied, “I take joy in goodness.” Thus, if one constantly abides in goodness, inwardly there is no anxiety, outwardly no fear; one stands alone without shame before one’s shadow, sleeps alone without guilt before the lamp. Above, one may commune with the divine; below, one may solidify human relationships. Virtue pervades the hidden and the manifest, and blessings and auspiciousness will gather.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the Liuzi*\n*(Collated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Record Keeper and Editorial Assistant of Bozhou)*\n\n**Chapter Eleven: Honoring Agriculture**\n\nClothing and food are the foundation of the people. The people are the foundation of the state. The people rely on clothing and food as fish rely on water; the state relies on its people as a person relies on their feet. Without water, fish cannot live; without feet, a person cannot walk; without its people, a state cannot be governed. The former kings, understanding this, ensured the people had clothing and food.\n\nThus, when the agricultural omen appears at dawn in the first month, and the celestial signs gather at the corners of the earth—agriculture being the term for plowing and sowing—this is the auspicious month of the first lunar dawn. As yang qi surges and the veins of earth and trees stir, the Son of Heaven personally plows in the eastern suburbs on the first *hai* day. The queen and consorts personally tend silkworms in the northern suburbs on the first *si* day. Though the state has no lack of skilled farmers, the ruler plows himself; though the world has no shortage of silkworm maidens, the queen and consorts tend silkworms themselves. Above, this provides for the ancestral temples; below, it encourages the myriad people.\n\nThe laws of Shennong state: If a man in his prime does not plow, someone in the world will suffer hunger. If a woman in her youth does not weave, someone in the world will suffer cold. Therefore, the Son of Heaven plows himself, and the queen and consorts weave themselves, setting the example for all under heaven. Thus, those who do not exert themselves in plowing will have nothing to sustain life; those who do not labor in weaving will have nothing to cover their bodies. When clothing and food are abundant, wickedness does not arise; with peace and no strife, the world is harmonious. The wise have no schemes to employ, and the brave have no might to display.\n\nThus, clothing and food are the people’s foundation, while craftsmanship is secondary. Carved patterns and intricate engravings harm farming; embroidered silks and elaborate sashes disrupt women’s work. If farming is harmed, hunger follows; if women’s work is disrupted, cold ensues. When hunger and cold arrive together, to forbid theft is like fanning flames to prevent burning or stirring water to seek stillness—it cannot be done. When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame; when granaries are full, people understand ritual and propriety.\n\nTherefore, those who establish states must prioritize the substance of fields and silkworms over the splendor of beauty, valuing grain and silk as treasures and regarding pearls and jade as dung. Why? Pearls and jade are but empty playthings, while grain and silk have practical use. Even if all the world’s tiles and pebbles turned to fine jade, and all sand and stone became luminous pearls, in years of flood or drought, when famine strikes, jade cannot ward off cold, nor can pearls fill hunger. Though one may possess a mirror that outshines the sun or a gem that rivals the moon, they are of no use—no different from painting a portrait of Xi Shi, beautiful yet unable to bring joy, or carving peaches and plums, lifelike yet inedible.\n\nClothing and food are the means by which people live, and of these, food is the most urgent. Frost and snow may pile high, but thatch cannot replace furs—*ku* being thatch, meaning without cloth or silk, one can only wear thatch or *meng* (women’s garments; in the Jiangdong region, thatch is also called *gai*). When a household is as empty as a hanging chime, grass and wood cannot serve as grain. Thus, the former kings established nine years’ worth of reserves in their states to prepare for emergencies and relieve disasters.\n\nIn the times of Yao and Tang, there were ten years’ worth of stores. When the nine-year flood and seven-year drought struck, no one heard of famine or starvation, nor of bodies abandoned in ditches—all because of abundant reserves. The reason grain is not stored is that too many live by wandering trades while too few till the soil.\n\nThe *ming* insect emerges in autumn and dies in autumn—*ming* eats the heart of seedlings, *teng* eats the joints, *shi* eats the roots, and *zei* eats the leaves. These four pests are all calamities for people. A single season of infestation leads to years of food shortages. Now, if one person plows while a hundred consume, the harm is far greater than that of the *ming* insect.\n\nThus did the former kings reverently bestow the seasons upon the people, exhorting and instructing them in agriculture and sericulture, reducing those who lived by wandering trades, and lessening the burdens of corvée labor. Then granaries stood full, and songs of praise arose. Though war-horses might muster or floods and droughts strike, the state never knew anxiety, nor the people harm.\n\n**Cherishing the People (Chapter Twelve)**\nHeaven engendered the teeming people and set a ruler over them. The ruler is the people’s heaven. Heaven nurtures all things, with yin and yang as its great principles; the ruler transforms the people, with governance and instruction as his duty. Thus, when cold and heat come unseasonably, epidemics arise; when wind and rain are untimely, the year suffers famine. Punishments are the people’s cold and heat; teachings and commands are their wind and rain. If punishments are untimely, the people are harmed; if teachings and commands lack moderation, customs decay. Therefore, in muddied waters no fish flicks its tail; in parched earth no tree stands firm; under oppressive governance no people enjoy ease. Governance toward the people is like a zither or lute: if the great strings are strung too tight, the small strings snap, and when the small strings snap, the great strings fall silent. When the feet are cold, the heart suffers; when the people toil, the state is harmed. When the feet are warm, the heart is at peace; when the people rest, the state is secure.\n\nThus, those who govern well must take benevolence and love as their foundation, not harshness and cruelty as their priority. They pardon punishments to preserve lives, reduce corvée and taxes to rest the people’s strength, lighten levies so as not to exhaust their wealth, and refrain from encroaching on farming seasons to ensure sufficiency. Then households will be provided for, the state will be prosperous, and great peace may be achieved.\n\nThe people’s relationship to their ruler is like a child’s to its parents. Never have parents been rich while their children were poor, nor parents poor while their children were rich. Thus, when the people abound, it is not only their own abundance but the state’s; when they suffer want, it is not only their own want but the state’s. As the saying goes: “When the hundred clans are sufficient, with whom is the ruler not sufficient? When the hundred clans are insufficient, with whom is the ruler sufficient?” This is the meaning.\n\nIn the governance of the former kings, above they followed the seasons of heaven, below they nurtured the myriad things. Grass and trees, birds and insects did not lose their place. Before otters had offered fish in sacrifice, nets were not cast; before jackals had offered beasts, hunting was not undertaken; before hawks had struck their prey, snares were not set; before frost and dew had settled, grass and trees were not felled. Grass and trees have life but no awareness; birds and beasts have awareness but no understanding—yet benevolence and love were extended even to them. How much more should they be extended to people?\n\nThus, when a ruler’s benevolence is like spring and his grace like rain, his virtue moistening the myriad things, the people will die for him. In former times, King Tai dwelt in Bin—King Tai, that is, Gugong Danfu, the fifteenth-generation descendant of Hou Ji. Practicing benevolence and love toward the people, in one year a market formed, in two years a town, in three years a city. That it came to be so was because his benevolence and love overflowed. The people followed him, for his benevolence and love overflowed.\n\nThe lord of Fusha—Fusha being a state—lacked sufficient benevolence and love, and the people forsook him, coming to join Shun. Some say that when Shun attacked Fusha, its people abandoned their lord and came to him. It is unclear which came first, but the people turned from him because his benevolence and love were insufficient. Benevolence and love bind people more firmly than metal or stone; metal and stone may melt, but people cannot be parted.\n\nThus, the ruler is the soil, the people the plants. Never has rich soil failed to nourish lush plants; never has a benevolent ruler failed to foster a flourishing people.\n\n**Following Transformation (Chapter Thirteen)**\nThe ruler takes the people as his body; the people take the ruler as their heart. What the heart desires, the body must embrace; what the ruler desires, the people must follow. Never has the heart desired something without the body obeying, nor the ruler wished for something without the people complying.\n\nThe people’s following of their ruler is like grass bending to the wind, like water conforming to its vessel. Thus, the ruler’s virtue is the wind and the vessel; the people’s nature is the grass and the water. Grass sways with the wind: when the wind races east, it bends east; when the wind races west, it bends west—so it follows the wind’s direction. Water in a vessel takes its shape: if the vessel is square, the water is square; if the vessel is round, the water is round—so it follows the vessel’s form.\n\nThose below serve those above, following their conduct, like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound—no word is false. What those above favor, those below will favor even more. As the *Odes* says: “Inducing people is most easy,” for they follow their superiors.\n\nIn former times, Duke Huan of Qi favored purple clothing, and throughout his realm all wore strange hues. Duke Wen of Jin disliked lambskin robes, and all his ministers wore zang-sheep pelts—zang-sheep being old sheep, or ewe skins. Duke Ai of Lu favored Confucian garb, and the whole state donned Confucian robes. King Wuling of Zhao favored *juemao* caps, and all in his land wore *jun* caps. Purple is not a proper color, *xiang* not a fine virtue, Confucian robes not common attire, *jue* not an ornament for caps—yet all competed in these because they followed their ruler’s preferences.\n\nKing Ling of Chu favored slender waists, and his ministers and concubines starved themselves, many dying of hunger. King Goujian of Yue favored courage and bowed to fighting frogs—when leading his troops to destroy Wu, he saw a frog in the road, puffing itself up as if to resist his chariot wheels. The king descended and bowed to it, whereupon his warriors all emulated him, and he went on to destroy Wu. This showed the power of brave men’s strength. The people of his state treated life lightly, and many died in battle.\n\nLife is what people value most; death is what they detest most. Yet now they treat what they value lightly and what they detest heavily—why? Because they follow their ruler’s preferences.\n\nThe people of Yao and Shun could be enfeoffed by the household; the people of Jie and Zhou could be executed by the rooftop. It was not that the people of Yao and Shun were all inherently benevolent and righteous, nor that the people of Jie and Zhou were born wicked and perverse. The difference in good and evil arose from the transforming influence of their rulers.\n\nThus the enlightened ruler is cautious in his preferences, using them to rectify the customs of the age; he establishes a moral influence that flows into later generations. Yet it may be that those below do not necessarily follow their ruler’s preferences, and people do not necessarily align with him.\n\nFor instance, in the age of Tang Yao, the Four Fiends ran rampant; in the time of Yin Zhou, the Three Loyalists remained steadfast; under Han Wen, though he practiced frugality, the common people were extravagant; and in Qi Jing’s reign of excess, Yan Ying alone was thrifty. These are claims that fail to grasp the truth.\n\nWhy? Winter’s virtue is yin, yet there are the frigid flames of Xiaoqiu—where fire naturally arises in the Xiaoqiu mountains, igniting in spring and extinguishing in autumn. This mound spans a thousand *li*, with flames kindling at its center. Summer’s virtue is yang, yet frost and sleet may fall. (Sleet is a mix of rain and snow.) If even the virtue of Heaven and Earth cannot be uniform in yin and yang, how can the worthy and sagely expect to unify the myriad people?\n\nThus, though the steelyard may be true, it cannot avoid the slightest deviation; though the scale may be level, it cannot escape the smallest discrepancy. To extend the analogy: when Tang Yao ruled above, the realm was well-ordered, yet the Four Fiends alone caused chaos—still, we say Yao governed well, for order was the norm. When Yin Zhou ruled above, the realm was in turmoil, yet the Three Loyalists alone remained upright—still, we say Zhou ruled poorly, for chaos was widespread. Though Han Wen was frugal, some people were extravagant—still, we say the age was thrifty, for frugality prevailed. Though Qi Jing was excessively lavish, Yan Ying alone practiced thrift—still, we say the state was extravagant, for excess was the norm.\n\nWater’s nature should be cool, yet there are the warm springs of Huayang (Huayang, a southern region in Liang, where hot springs emerge)—still, we say water is cool, for coolness is the norm.\n\nFire’s nature should be hot, yet there are the cold flames of Xiaoqiu—still, we say fire is hot, for heat is the norm. Swift winds stir waves, high and low stand in contrast; mountains rise and valleys sink, their differences measured in fathoms. Yet when viewed from afar, we still say water is level—this is to grasp the greater principle. Thus, in judging worldly affairs, one always takes the majority as the standard.\n\nNow, those who speak must attend to the intent beyond their words, lest they cling to the letter and harm the meaning.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Safeguarding the Dao**\n\nMethods and laws are what the ruler holds, the pivot and mechanism of governance. Methods reside within, adapting to tasks and responding to change; laws are established without, suiting the times to guide people. When people follow the Dao yet remain unaware of its calculations, this is method. When teachings are displayed and commands issued to instruct others, this is law.\n\nThe ruler who safeguards the world with transformation is like heaven transforming the myriad things with qi. Qi transforms the myriad things yet leaves no visible trace; method transforms people yet leaves no visible form. Thus, heaven’s numinosity lies in qi, while the ruler’s divinity lies in method. Method achieves wonder through hidden subtlety; law excels through clear judgment.\n\nWhen the pure wind turns shallow, people grow contentious; once deceit and falsehood arise, laws are established to restrain them. *Restrain* here means to correct. Commands and teachings are set forth to show people the correct standard.\n\nThose who found states and rule others, though capable of good governance, have never abandoned law to achieve order. Thus, Shennong ruled without punishments, yet the people were good—yet those who govern cannot discard law to rule others. Shun wielded shield and battle-axe to subdue the Youmiao; the Miao people would not submit to Shun, but when he danced with shield and axe between the two steps, the Miao submitted of their own accord. *The Book of Documents* states: \"After seventy days, the Miao came to submit.\" Those who wage war cannot lay down their armor to control bandits.\n\nEstablishing laws is like skilled charioteering: one assesses the horse’s strength, estimates the road’s distance, aligns the bit and reins, and follows the momentum. Thus one can ascend slopes and charge into peril without overturning, like a carriage on difficult terrain yet free from collapse. One can traverse danger and cover great distances without straying from the track.\n\nThe ruler is like the charioteer; law is like the reins; the people are like the horse; the horse is like the track; governance is like holding the reins. The reinsman desires the horse to follow the track; the enlightened law desires people to follow order. If the reins are uneven, the horse strays from the track; if the law is unsuited to the times, people deviate from principle.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler strives to follow the law and adapt to the times. If it benefits the people, one need not imitate antiquity; if it harms affairs, one cannot cling to the old. The decline of Xia and Shang came from not changing their laws; the rise of the Three Dynasties came from not copying one another, yet each achieved kingship. Yao and Shun followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; Tang and Wu governed differently yet their names endured for generations. From this, we see that laws should change—no single era suffices.\n\nYet today, those who uphold the law are drowned in ancient statutes, while Confucians are bound by old rites, failing to recognize that as circumstances shift, laws must adapt. Such men may be entrusted with enforcing the law to teach, but not with debating the law to establish teaching.\n\nThus, the wise create laws, while fools are constrained by them; the worthy reform rites, while the unworthy cling to them. Those bound by law are unfit to discuss affairs; those who merely regulate law are unfit to debate principle.\n\nTo grasp the laws of one age and impose them on people of a hundred generations is like using one garment to ward off cold and heat, or one medicine to treat all sores. To carry the rites of one time and use them to instruct endless customs is like marking the boat to seek the sword—when a man of Song crossed the river and lost his sword, he carved a mark on the boat, waiting to reach the other shore before searching—or like guarding the stump to wait for the hare: a hunter once startled a hare that dashed into a stump and died. A passerby found it and stayed all day, guarding the stump in hopes of another hare to kill.\n\nThus, those who establish laws are the source of rites, but not the means of governance. Rites are the ancestral standard of accomplished transformation, but not the means by which transformation is achieved. The ancestral standard of transformation lies in following the times; the foundation of governance lies in adapting to the world. Never has there been one who, failing to adapt to the world, desired order, or, failing to follow the times, achieved transformation. To govern by such means is not to forget.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Rewards and Punishments**\n\nIn governing the people and guiding subordinates, nothing is more correct than law; in establishing laws and teaching, nothing is greater than rewards and punishments. Rewards and punishments are the state’s sharp instruments, the handles by which people are controlled.\n\nThus, heaven completes the year through the movements of the gnomon—one circuit of the heavens spans 365¼ degrees. The sun and moon each follow their own measured paths: the sun moves slowly, completing one circuit in a year; the moon moves swiftly, completing one circuit in a month. The state achieves order through law and teaching.\n\nWhen the gnomon moves in heaven, the seasons take shape on earth; when the law stirs above, order takes shape among the people. The gnomon’s movement begins with spring and ends with autumn; the law’s movement begins with rewards and ends with punishments.\n\nThus, the warm winds of spring stir the sprouts and blossoms; the cold dew of autumn fells the lush leaves. Clear rewards for the virtuous encourage good people; conspicuous punishments for the guilty deter the wicked below.\n\nThose skilled in reward follow what the people love to encourage goodness; those skilled in punishment follow what the people hate to suppress wickedness. Thus, small rewards encourage goodness, and light punishments quell wickedness. Reward one person, and the world rejoices; punish one person, and the world stands in awe. Thus one can teach narrowly yet govern broadly, achieve much with little.\n\nThis is like Wang Liang’s skill in charioteering: he knew the horse’s hunger and fullness, gauged the rhythm of speed and restraint, and so, without relying on the whip, could promise a thousand *li*. Yet the whip cannot be entirely abandoned, for horses may grow unruly.\n\nThe sage’s governance uses ranks and rewards to encourage goodness, and benevolence to nurture the people, so that punishments are unused and great peace is attained. Yet punishments cannot be abolished, for the people may grow unrestrained.\n\nThus, while rewards encourage goodness, punishments cannot be absent; while punishments suppress wickedness, rewards cannot be absent. When rewards are impartial and punishments are just, the principles of governance are established. Therefore, the ruler is the arbiter of rewards and punishments, guiding people toward goodness. Their benefits are weighty, and their authority is great. Even a small, dangled reward suffices to encourage goodness; even a light, implied threat suffices to deter wickedness. Why, then, should one spread lavish rewards to bait subordinates or wield overwhelming power to overawe the people?\n\nThus, a single reward must not lack credibility, nor a single punishment lack clarity. If rewards are given but not trusted, they fail to encourage; if punishments are meted out but not understood, they fail to deter. When encouragement and deterrence both fail, good and evil lose their proper order. Therefore, the enlightened ruler rewards goodness and punishes wickedness not for personal gain, but for the sake of the state. Those who please the ruler but bring no benefit to the state receive no reward; those who defy the ruler but benefit the state incur no punishment. Punishments must be applied only to those at fault, and rewards must be bestowed only on those who have rendered service. If rewards are trustworthy and punishments are clear, then the people will follow as surely as a boat glides along a river or a cart rolls along a road—wherever they turn, they will succeed; whatever path they take, they will reach their destination.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Examining Names**\n\nWords convey principles, and principles are the foundation of words; names verify reality, and reality is the source of names. Without words, principles cannot be clarified; without names, reality cannot be distinguished. If principles are elucidated by words yet the words themselves are unprincipled, or if reality is discerned by names yet the names do not reflect reality, then trusting words while abandoning principles does not yield true understanding, nor does trusting names while neglecting reality.\n\nThus, the wise scrutinize words to uncover principles, without losing sight of principles in favor of mere rhetoric; they hold fast to names to demand reality, without discarding reality to preserve empty labels. In this way, words and principles are both thoroughly understood, and names and reality are both correctly aligned.\n\nYet when the world transmits words, it often magnifies small truths into great falsehoods, turning wrong into right. The wider the transmission, the more distorted the principles; the more names proliferate, the more reality is inverted—until a dog is mistaken for a man, and white is turned into black.\n\nIf one points to a dog and calls it a man, or claims white is black, the resemblance is absurd. Yet by such twisted analogies, one thing is likened to another: a dog is said to resemble a *jué* (a mythical beast), a *jué* resembles a macaque, and a macaque resembles a man—thus, a dog resembles a man. White is said to resemble *xiāng* (light yellow), *xiāng* resembles yellow, yellow resembles vermilion, vermilion resembles purple, purple resembles *qián* (a bluish-black), and *qián* resembles black—thus, white becomes black.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s four faces were not truly eight-eyed; he governed the realm by dispatching lords to the four directions, which later became exaggerated into four faces. *Kuí*’s single foot was not literally one-legged; as the *Lüshi Chunqiu* records, when Duke Ai asked Confucius whether *Kuí* truly had only one foot, Confucius replied, \"To tune the six pitch-pipes and harmonize the eight tones, one man suffices.\" Yet later generations took this to mean *Kuí* had but a single foot. The *Zhuangzi* states: \"*Kuí*’s one foot\" refers to his halting gait.\n\nThe jade uncut from Zhou was in fact a dead rat; the people of Zhou prized unworked jade, and when a swindler wrapped a dead rat in multicolored silk and sold it as jade, they placed it in a treasure casket, believing it genuine. Bian He heard of this and borrowed it to examine, only to laugh and declare it a dead rat. The owner, ashamed, discarded both the rat and the casket.\n\nThe phoenix of Chu was merely a pheasant; when a man of Chu obtained a pheasant with five-colored plumage, he mistook it for a phoenix and sought to present it to his lord. Midway, he saw many such birds in the fields and asked what they were. Told they were pheasants, he turned back in shame.\n\nThe Wise Old Man of Foolish Valley was deemed a fool; a worthy man who secluded himself in Foolish Valley called himself \"Foolish Old Man,\" and the people, hearing this, took him for a true fool—until they later learned he was a man of wisdom.\n\nThe Yellow Elder’s beautiful daughter was branded ugly; the Yellow Elder had a daughter of thirty who remained unmarried, her bearing and beauty unmatched. When asked about her, he modestly replied, \"My daughter is too ugly to marry.\" People took her for truly ugly—until she was taken as a consort, and they saw her beauty.\n\nThe man of Lu in flowing robes was no true Confucian; the \"flowing robes\" were wide-sleeved garments worn by scholars of the arts, distinct from the attire of commoners. When Duke Ai saw Confucius dressed differently from the nobles and the people, he suspected it was Confucian garb and inquired about it.\n\nDongguo playing the *gan* knew nothing of music; the *gan* resembled a sheng, with thirty-six pipes. King Xuan of Qi loved to hear it played, and three thousand musicians at his court could perform it. Those who could play received stipends, and Dongguo, a scholar, falsely claimed to be among them, holding a *gan* to his lips to demand payment. When King Xuan died and King Cheng ascended, the musicians were tested one by one, and Dongguo, exposed as a fraud, fled and never reappeared.\n\nFour faces and one foot were never real; uncut jade and phoenixes were not what they were named; the man of Lu and Dongguo bore empty titles of praise; the Wise Old Man of Foolish Valley and the Yellow Elder suffered undeserved infamy. From this, we see how hearsay loses truth, how names and reality are inverted, how beauty and ugliness lack fixed labels, and how worthiness and foolishness lack true measure. The corruption of custom lies in failing to examine names and reality, blindly trusting hearsay, and mistaking semblance for truth.\n\nThe \"Wild Elder\" is called a \"field father,\" yet the Wild Elder is the name of a medicinal herb—people mistakenly take it for a field laborer. The \"Riverbank Maiden\" is called a \"woman,\" but the *ni* maiden is the name of a medicinal herb, the same as today’s *fandai*. People, not examining its name, call it a woman. \"Yao’s Brew\" and \"Yu’s Provisions\" are called food and drink, yet these too are names of medicinal substances. Yao’s Brew is the sap of a tree, while Yu’s Provisions are the reddest earth found in red soil—when Yu governed the floods and provisions ran scarce, he ate this earth, hence the name. People, not examining its name, say it is today’s food and drink. \"Dragon Liver\" and \"Ox Knee\" are called meat, yet both are names of medicinal herbs. People, not examining them, take them for the flesh of dragons and oxen.\n\nWhen a well was dug and a man was \"obtained,\" it was said a man emerged from the earth. In Song, a family dug a well and declared, \"Our household dug a well and gained the benefit of one man.\" People, not understanding, said a man had emerged from the earth, and all repeated it. The lord of the state heard and summoned them to ask. The man of Song replied, \"When my household dug the well, we lived far from water and had to send one person daily to draw it. Since digging the well, we have saved one person’s labor each day. I said digging the well was like gaining one man—it was not that a man emerged from beneath the earth.\"\n\n\"Three pigs crossed the river\" was said to mean they swam atop the water. A man of Lu, reading the *Records of the Historian*, misread the characters and said, \"Three pigs crossed the river.\" Someone asked, \"What does it mean?\" The man of Lu replied, \"They swam atop the water.\" Zixia heard and went to look, then said, \"The Lord of Jin crossed the river on the day *jihai*. The scribe who wrote the record mistakenly wrote *san* ‘three’ for *ji* ‘self’ and *shi* ‘pig’ for *hai* ‘the twelfth earthly branch.’\" The man of Lu did not believe him and went to Jin to ask. The Lord of Jin had indeed crossed the river on the day *jihai*, and only then did he realize the characters had truly been miswritten.\n\nSuch cases are beyond counting. Thus, the fox and the leopard cat, two creatures, are joined by their names—the fox is a wild dog, the leopard cat a wild feline—yet merged into one. The *qiongqiong* and the *juxu*, though one beast, are split by their descriptions: the *qiongqiong* has long forelegs, the *juxu* long hindlegs. This beast dwells in Yanmen Mountain; when it sees a person, the *juxu* carries the *qiongqiong* and flees. Due to the complexity of its name, it is divided into two. Though their names are established, their reality is lost; though their terms are used, their forms go unexamined.\n\nThus, the ancients were always cautious in transmitting names, closely examining their terms while distantly drawing from principle, lest names harm reality. When reality is concealed by names, names cannot harbor falsehood, nor can reality be obscured in its truth. This is called \"rectifying names.\"\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Three ends*\n*Liuzi, Scroll Four begins*\n*Commentary by Yuan Xiaozheng, Registrar of Bozhou*\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Vulgar Names**\n\nNames are the forms of what is designated; words are the names of what is designated. Forms may be skillful or clumsy, names may be fair or foul, and words may be good or evil. Good names and words please the human heart, while evil names and words offend the human ear. Therefore, the ancients, when establishing names for settlements or children, invariably chose good names, lest the unworthy harm reality.\n\nIn former times, Bi Wan’s name—*wan* meaning \"abundance\"—presaged great fortune. Bi Wan was a descendant of the Duke of Bi and the son of Duke Wen. *Wan* signifies \"greatness.\" *Wei* also denotes a \"great settlement,\" and later, he was enfeoffed with the settlement of Wei. Bi Wan eventually became a minister. By the end of the Zhou, when the Marquis Wen of the state of Wei ascended the throne, his descendants indeed became kings.\n\nIn contrast, Chou of Jin, whose name meant \"enmity\" and \"misfortune,\" encountered disaster. The crown prince of the Jin lord was named Chou (\"enmity\"), and his misfortune was paired. Later, he fathered a son named Chengshi (\"accomplished master\"). When Chengshi grew up, he killed Chou. Yet abundance and greatness do not invariably bring good fortune, nor do enmity and misfortune always bring calamity. Still, people harbor love and aversion because names bear goodness or evil.\n\nToday, when rustics see a child playing in the daytime, they take it as an omen of joy and celebration; when they dream of sparrows at night, they take it as a sign of official rank. Yet those who see children playing are not necessarily joyful, nor do those who dream of sparrows necessarily don the cap of office. People delight in such things because their names flatter them.\n\nThe spring was called \"Thief’s Spring,\" and Confucius would not drink from it. The settlement was called \"Morning Song,\" and Yan Yuan would not lodge there. The lane was called \"Victorious Mother,\" and Zengzi turned his carriage away. *Ren* means \"wheel\"—when Zengzi wished to go to Zheng and reached the lane of Victorious Mother, he halted his wheels and would not tread its ground, turning his carriage back. The pavilion was called \"Cypress Man,\" and the Han emperor fled by night. The Han emperor was Gaozu. Passing the Cypress Man Pavilion at night, he wished to rest. He asked, \"What is the name of this pavilion?\" His attendants replied, \"It is called the Pavilion of the Planted Man.\" Gaozu said, \"If it is called the Pavilion of the Pressing Man, it would press upon one to hasten away.\" After he left, assassins indeed came to harm Gaozu, but by dawn, they could not find him. It was Zhao Gao who had plotted this, but Gaozu pardoned his crime and did not hold it against him. Why? Because the name harmed righteousness.\n\nThe omen of a sparrow’s play brings no benefit to man, yet if its name merely approaches goodness, the common world cherishes it; the greatness of Yi Spring shelters all living beings, yet if its name harms righteousness, sages and worthies abhor it. From this we may say: the distinction between good and evil lies in the name.\n\nLong ago, a poor man named his dog \"Wealth\" and his son \"Joy.\" When he was making offerings, the dog entered the room. He scolded it, saying, \"Wealth, get out!\" The invocator said, \"This is inauspicious.\" Soon after, misfortune befell the household, and his son later died. He wept, saying, \"Joy—yet I do not grieve for myself.\"\n\nIn Zhuang Village, a man named his eldest son \"Thief\" and his second son \"Beat.\" One day, Thief took a garment out to weed the fields with a hoe. His mother called him, saying, \"Thief!\" An officer, hearing this, bound him. His mother cried out to Beat, calling him to explain to the officer, but in her haste, her words stumbled, and she could only say, \"Beat! Beat!\" The officer then beat Thief nearly to choking.\n\nWhen a name is improperly set, the body suffers its harm. How true it is that one must carefully consider the fitness of a name!\n\n*Knowing Men, Chapter Eighteen*\n\nWhen the dragon lies hidden, auspicious clouds have yet to gather, and it dwells among fish and turtles. When the swift steed remains concealed, Sun Yang has not yet recognized it, and it must share its stable with sluggish nags. The *ji* is a dragon-horse; the *nutai*, a dull-witted steed. Sun Yang was skilled in judging horses in the state of Sunchang.\n\nWhen a scholar is obscured, no discerning patron has yet taken notice, and he mingles with the common laborers. Without divine insight and penetrating clarity, none can distinguish them. Thus, the wise judge of men listens before words are spoken, observes before signs appear, and scrutinizes their spirit and intellect to discern their talents and abilities—this may be called knowing men. To recognize them only after their achievements are complete is no different from calling oneself sharp-eared upon hearing thunder or clear-sighted upon seeing the sun and moon.\n\nWhen Kong Fangyu judged horses—Kong Fangyu being a man of Qin—Bo Le recommended him to Duke Mu as a horse appraiser. After three months, he returned. The duke asked, \"Have you found a horse?\" Fangyu replied, \"I have. It is in Shaqiu.\" The duke asked, \"What is it like?\" Fangyu said, \"A yellow mare.\" When the horse arrived, it was a black stallion. The duke, furious, summoned Bo Le and rebuked him: \"Why have you recklessly recommended such a man? He cannot even tell a horse’s sex or color—what skill does he have in judging horses?\" Bo Le replied, \"Kong Fangyu’s judgment of horses lies in their essence, not their outward form.\" Later, when the duke rode the horse, it indeed traveled a thousand *li* in a day. Though it did not chase the wind or outrun lightning, leaving dust and shadow behind, its swiftness was already evident.\n\nWhen Xue Zhu appraised swords—Xue Zhu, a man of Qin, was the world’s foremost judge of blades—he served the King of Wu in selecting swords. Though the blade had not yet severed the hide of a black rhinoceros on land or sliced through a flood-dragon in water, the sharpness of its edge was already revealed.\n\nThus, when Fan Li barked from the dog’s hole, Wen Zhong heard it and bowed to him. Fan Li was a man of Yue, as was Wen Zhong, who served as a minister to the King of Yue. When Wen Zhong passed Fan Li’s gate, Fan Li barked at him from the dog’s hole. Wen Zhong said, \"A dog barks at people—Fan Li must take me for one.\" He turned his carriage back to Fan Li’s door, entered, and bowed to him, recommending him as the King of Yue’s left minister. When the king wished to attack Wu, he followed the strategies of Wen Zhong and Fan Li and ultimately defeated the King of Wu. Fan Li later said to Wen Zhong, \"King Goujian of Yue has a long neck and a beak like a bird—he can share hardship but not joy. He will later harm me, and I wish to leave.\" Wen Zhong replied, \"In serving my lord, I would die to achieve renown. Even if he later harms me, I will accept death without regret, for I will never bear the name of one who betrayed his lord. I will not leave.\"\n\nFan Li then drifted upon the Five Lakes to fish, styling himself the Old Fisherman, and never emerged again for the rest of his life. The King of Yue, missing Fan Li, cast a golden statue in his likeness and made offerings to it in all four seasons.\n\nWen Zhong served the King of Yue, yet before a full year had passed, he offended the king and was indeed harmed by him, just as Fan Li had foretold.\n\nBao Long chanted verses while kneeling upon stone, and Confucius alighted from his carriage for him. Bao Long was a worthy man, a contemporary of Confucius.\n\nWhen Yao came to know Shun, the shade of the mulberry tree did not shift. Yao, intending to raise Shun from the shade of Thunder Marsh, spoke with him beneath a mulberry tree, and the mulberry’s shadow remained unmoved. Yao then knew Shun was a worthy man, fit to be Son of Heaven, and so yielded the throne to him.\n\nWhen King Wen came to know Lü Wang, he did not tarry through the long day. King Wen went out hunting and divined, saying, \"The hunt shall yield a great catch—not a bear, not a grizzly, but the teacher of an emperor.\" It was indeed Lü Wang, and the king shared his carriage with him on the return journey.\n\nThe subtlest flicker of brow or lash—\nLong ago, a man named Chen Yong was skilled at detecting thieves. From the merest glance between brow and lash, he could tell a man was a thief. Zhao Zi said to him, \"I have heard that eyes sharp enough to see fish beneath the spring will meet with misfortune.\" Before a year had passed, Chen Yong was indeed slain by bandits.\n\n—appears in the countenance;\nThe finest inflection of voice\nstirs the heart.\nThus do the worthy and sage observe and perceive without waiting for success to reveal it.\n\nWhen Chen Ping abandoned Chu to join Han, Wei Wu knew not his skill in strategy. Chen Ping was a native of Huyou in Yangwu Commandery. In his youth, his family was poor, and he served as the village’s community head, dividing meat with perfect fairness. The village elders said to him, \"Young Master Chen divides the meat most evenly.\" Chen replied, \"If I were to govern the realm as its chancellor, I would divide it as evenly as this meat.\" Later, when Han and Chu contended to destroy Qin, Chen Ping served as a general under Xiang Yu. But Xiang Yu could not employ the worthy, so Chen abandoned Chu and came to join Han. The Han chancellor Wei Wu recommended him to the High Ancestor, who appointed him as Protector of the Army. Thus he shattered Chu and destroyed Qin, expounding six extraordinary strategies to pacify the realm. Hence it is said he abandoned Chu to join Han.\n\nWhen Han Xin fled to Blackwater, Xiao He knew his ability to command. Han Xin was a native of Huaiyin. Poor and without occupation, he favored wearing a long sword. Later, he fled to Blackwater and became a minor official, but when twelve men were condemned for an offense, all were executed. As the executioner’s blade reached Han Xin, he looked up at the executioner, Lord Teng, and said, \"Does the king seek to pacify the realm by slaying a stalwart?\" Lord Teng, hearing this, spared him. He was then brought before Xiao He, who recommended him to the High Ancestor. The High Ancestor appointed him Granary Intendant, but Han Xin, deeming the post too lowly, abandoned the High Ancestor and fled. When Xiao He heard that Han Xin had fled, he pursued him for three days before returning. He said to the High Ancestor, \"Han Xin is a renowned knight of the realm. If you employ him, he will stay; if not, he will ultimately flee.\" The High Ancestor then appointed him Grand General, and with that, he destroyed Zhao, shattered Wei, swept through the Three Qin, and pacified the realm—all through Han Xin’s power.\n\nWas it only after he expounded his six strategies that his brilliance became clear, or only after shattering Zhao and Wei that his talent was recognized? If one does not perceive his wisdom in the moment of crisis or witness his courage in the face of peril, such judgment is but the discernment of a common man, not the insight of a sage.\n\nWhen Gongshu carved the phoenix, its crest and spurs were not yet formed, its emerald plumage not yet set. Those who saw its body called it a quail or a kite; those who saw its head named it a partridge. All mocked its ugliness and laughed at its clumsiness. Yet when the phoenix was complete—its emerald crest towering like clouds, its crimson spurs flashing like lightning, its brocade body scattering like dawn’s glow, its patterned wings soaring with countless shafts of radiance—it spread its wings and soared through the rafters of the sky, circling for three days without alighting. Only then did people praise its wonder and extol its craftsmanship.\n\nWhen Yao faced the floodwaters, vast and surging, drowning the hills and engulfing the people in darkness and despair, Yu was but a common man, without merit or fame. Yet Yao, knowing him deeply, entrusted him with taming the waters. Yu then carved open Dragon Gate, hewed through Jing Mountain, guided the streams of Bear’s Ear, and pierced the peaks of Crow and Mouse. He raced against the wind—like a comb raking through hair—endured torrential rains, his face and eyes blackened by the wilds, his hands and feet calloused and cracked. He had no time to adjust his hat or pass through his own gate, yet he bound the hundred rivers to pour into the sea, extending west to the Flowing Sands, sparing the people from becoming fish and turtles. Only then did the masses sing his praises and recognize his worth.\n\nThus, to perceive skill in the raw is the insight of one like Wang Er toward Gongshu; to recognize craftsmanship only after the phoenix’s completion is the judgment of the common crowd. To know a man’s worth before he has achieved merit is Yao’s wisdom toward Yu; to acknowledge his virtue only after his deeds is the understanding of the masses. Truly, knowing others is no easy task.\n\nHou Ying, a gatekeeper and menial servant at Yi Gate, was recognized by Wuji. Hou Ying, a man of Wei named Ying, was keeper of the eastern gate of Daliang. Though a lowly bondsman, when the Lord of Wei, Wuji, sought worthy men, he prepared grand seats to receive the nobles of Wei. Before the feast began, Wuji himself drove to Hou Ying’s home, inviting him to ride together to the market. There, Hou Ying halted Wuji’s carriage and said, “In this market, there is a butcher named Zhu Hai—a worthy man, though his office has not advanced him, hidden in the slaughterhouse. I wish to speak with him; please wait a moment.” Hou Ying alighted and conversed with Zhu Hai at length, while the market folk cursed him for detaining the lord’s carriage. Yet Hou Ying, watching Wuji’s expression, saw no sign of impatience. Knowing Wuji to be a man of true virtue, he returned to the carriage, and together they went to Wuji’s estate. The assembled guests were astonished, only then realizing Hou Ying’s worth.\n\nYu Rang, a fugitive retainer of the Fan and Zhonghang clans, was esteemed by Zhibo. Yu Rang, originally in the service of Fan and Zhonghang, turned to Zhibo after they were destroyed. When Zhibo was later killed by Viscount Xiang of Zhao, Yu Rang sought to avenge him. Disguising himself as a menial, he lay in wait in the privy. As the viscount approached the privy gate, his heart stirred with unease. He ordered a search, and there was Yu Rang, a sword concealed at his side. Questioned, Yu Rang said, “I was a retainer of Zhibo. I have come to avenge him.” The viscount said, “A man of resolve!” and spared him. Later, Yu Rang lacquered his body, swallowed charcoal to distort his voice, and altered his appearance, intent on killing the viscount. His wife did not recognize him; his friends did, saying, “If you wish to kill the viscount, why not first serve him and then strike? Would that not be easier than needlessly disfiguring yourself?” Yu Rang replied, “Can one eat a man’s salary while harboring ill will toward him? I will not do so.” When the viscount next passed, Yu Rang lay in ambush beneath a bridge. As the viscount’s horse shied at the bridge, he said, “It must be Yu Rang.” A search confirmed it. Enraged, the viscount accused him: “Before, in the privy, I spared you. Now you return to this? You deserve death. You once served Fan and Zhonghang, yet when Zhibo destroyed them, you did not avenge them but now seek to kill me—why?” Yu Rang said, “I served Fan and Zhonghang as an ordinary man, and I repaid them as one. Zhibo treated me as a man of the state, and I repay him as one—even in death, I have no regrets. I beg you, my lord, grant me your robe, that I may strike it with my sword before I die.” The viscount removed his robe and gave it to him. Yu Rang, eyes blazing, seized the sword and struck the garment. Though the viscount felt no joy as the robe was struck, his anger gradually subsided. Within ten days, Yu Rang died. His name was honored, his person renowned, his glory filling the age. Though he cut his throat in the court of Wei or lacquered his body in the outskirts of Zhao, his heart sought only to repay a debt of gratitude. The empty left seat of the carriage—such was the esteem of a man of the state. The empty left seat refers to the honored place in a carriage reserved for a guest. The esteem of a man of the state was the treatment Yu Rang received from Zhibo.\n\nThe world’s men of resolve long to repay kindness with their lives, as the blind yearn to see or the lame to walk. Yet their eyes never open, their feet never move—they can only lament in vain.\n\n**On Recommending the Worthy, Nineteenth**\nA state’s need for the worthy is like a chariot’s reliance on its wheels or a boat’s dependence on its oars. Without wheels, the chariot cannot move; without oars, the boat cannot cross. Without the worthy, a state cannot be governed. A state abundant in worthy men is like riding in a carriage driven by Zaofu.\n\nThe charioteer Zaofu was a master driver in King Mu’s time. As for the Yue traveler’s reliance on a boat—the Yue traveler was a man of Yue who dwelled by the sea and excelled at sailing. Without toiling his body, he could reach a thousand *li*; without moving his feet, he could arrive at Penglai. Penglai is a mountain in the sea, the abode of immortals.\n\nA court lacking in worthy men is like a phoenix missing six feathers, hoping to brush the azure sky with its back or pierce the crimson mist with its breast—yet it can never take flight. A towering mountain is not built from a single stone; a pavilion soaring into the clouds is not constructed from a single timber; a robe of white fox fur is not woven from the pelt of one armpit; the cosmos as a dwelling is not governed by one worthy alone.\n\nThus, the rulers of antiquity invariably sought out the worthy and summoned the reclusive, while ministers recommended the capable and promoted the wise. The Tang dynasty elevated the Eight Virtuous Ministers, fostering harmony and grace; the Zhou dynasty preserved the Ten Ministers of Order, spreading their resounding praise.\n\nWhen Confucius was in Wei, Zhao Yang abandoned his schemes. Zhao Yang of Jin, fond of warfare, wished to invade Wei, but knowing Confucius was there, he set aside his plans and could not attack. When Gànmù resided in Wei, the Qin people withdrew their troops. Gànmù was a worthy of Wei. Marquis Wen of Wei often visited him to consult on state affairs. When Qin intended to invade Wei, his advisors warned: \"Wei has the worthy Gànmù, and the marquis visits him daily to discuss governance—it cannot be attacked.\" The king of Qin halted his forces and did not invade Wei.\n\nWhile Gōng Qí had not yet fled, Duke Xian did not encroach. Gōng Qí was a prince of Yu. When Duke Xian of Jin sought to conquer Guo, he offered the famed jade of Chui Ji and a team of fine horses to Yu, requesting passage. Gōng Qí remonstrated: \"Guo is Yu’s shield. If the lips perish, the teeth grow cold.\" The men of Jin told Duke Xian: \"Gōng Qí is a weak and timid man—he cannot strengthen the defenses. Even if he did, the lord of Yu would not heed him. Simply offer more treasures, and success is assured.\" Duke Xian sent envoys with lavish gifts, and the lord of Yu, coveting the wealth, accepted. Gōng Qí then fled, and Duke Xian destroyed Guo, then turned his army to conquer Yu and returned.\n\nWhile Zǐyù still lived, Duke Wen sat askew. When Duke Wen of Jin battled Zǐyù, he crushed his forces. Yet the duke changed countenance and sat sideways, fearing that the worthy Zǐyù might devise new strategies against him.\n\nFrom this, we see that establishing governance and achieving order, repelling invasions and suppressing crises—these are the effects of recommending the worthy.\n\nA jade disk worth multiple cities lies buried in the shadows of Mount Jing; a luminous pearl hides its glow in the depths of Yu Pu. Jade flies without wings, pearls travel without a voice, yet their fame resounds from the Terrace of Zhang Hua, their brilliance dazzles in halls of silk and gauze—this is the power of a ruler’s elevation. But when worthy men possess talent yet refuse to come forward, when their wisdom rots in secluded peaks or their intellect decays in the brushwood—this is because no one has recommended them, and they cannot promote themselves.\n\nThe ancients competed to recommend those they knew, vying to draw forth their kind. If one’s talent suited governance, lineage was not questioned; if one’s wisdom could devise strategies, humble conduct was no obstacle.\n\nIn former times, rulers plucked the extraordinary from prisoners and convicts, raised the capable from butchers and peddlers. King Wen employed the Grand Duke, who had slaughtered oxen in Chao Ge. Emperor Gaozu employed Fan Kuai, who had sold dogs. Wuji employed Zhu Hai, who was a butcher. Guan Ying traded in silks and dyes, yet Gaozu employed him—all these were butchers and peddlers who were put to use.\n\nIn recommending the worthy, one did not avoid one’s own kin within the court, nor did one avoid suspicion when recommending from without. Qí Xī recommended his own son internally and a man he pitied externally. Thus, one who recommended the worthy received rewards in life and left behind an undying fragrance.\n\nOnce, Zigong asked Confucius: \"Who is the greatest worthy?\" Confucius replied: \"In Qi, there is Bào Shū; in Zheng, there is Zǐ Pí.\" Zigong said: \"But Qi has Guan Zhong, and Zheng has Zǐ Chǎn—are they not greater?\" Confucius said: \"I have heard that to promote the worthy is worthy, while to obstruct the worthy is unworthy.\"\n\nThough flesh and bone may resemble one’s ancestors, one’s words need not echo them. Bào Shū recommended Guan Zhong, and Zǐ Pí recommended Zǐ Chǎn—yet I have never heard that these two ever recommended anyone. To promote the worthy is a virtue surpassing one’s own worth—how much worse is it to suppress the worthy?\n\nThus, Qián Xī shattered his skull to vindicate Bai Li; Běi Guǒ slit his throat to exonerate Yan Ying. Běi Guǒ’s family was poor, unable to support his parents. Yanzi, knowing his worth, often shared grain with him. Later, when Yanzi was banished by the lord of Qi, Běi Guǒ cut his own throat in the ruler’s court to prove Yanzi’s innocence. The lord of Qi then reinstated Yanzi as prime minister.\n\nThose who give their lives without hesitation do so to recommend the worthy for the state. To sacrifice oneself without regret is the height of loyalty, the rarest of virtues.\n\nZāng Wénzhòng did not reveal Zhǎn Qín’s worth, and Confucius called him a usurper of office. Zhǎn Qín, also named Liǔxià, had served three times as magistrate without joy and been dismissed three times without resentment. Confucius, knowing his purity, married his elder brother’s daughter to him—only then did people recognize his worth.\n\nGōngsūn Hóng did not recommend Master Dong, and Jí Àn was about to denounce him for obstructing the worthy. Gōngsūn Hóng was Gōngsūn Hóng, and Master Dong was Dong Zhongshu. Jí Àn was a Han prime minister. Though Gōngsūn Hóng knew Dong’s worth, he did not recommend him, so Àn considered him a corrupter of the worthy.\n\nYú Qiū did not recommend Shū Fàng, and Lady Fan condemned him as unworthy. Yú Qiū was the prime minister of Chu. Once, King Zhuang of Chu held court with his ministers, and when he spoke with Yú Qiū at length, the sun grew late before he returned. Lady Fan descended the steps to greet him and asked the king: \"Why has the court lasted so long today?\" The king said: \"I was speaking with a worthy man, so it grew late.\" Lady Fan asked: \"Who is this worthy?\" The king replied: \"Yú Qiūzi.\"\n\nLady Fan then covered her mouth and laughed, saying: \"Though I am unworthy, I have been fortunate enough to hold the dustpan and broom. Of those I have recommended, ten were of my own kind. Yet Master Yú Qiū has served as prime minister for ten years, and those he has advanced are either his own kin or his brothers—monopolizing Your Majesty’s favor and usurping Your Majesty’s authority. Knowing Sūnshū Áo’s worth yet failing to recommend him—how can this be called worthy? How can he be deemed a man of virtue?\"\n\nKing Zhuang told this to Yú Qiū, who replied: \"Your servant confesses his fault.\" Thereupon he recommended Sūnshū Áo as prime minister. The governance of Chu flourished, and this was Sūnshū Áo’s achievement.\n\nShù Xián failed to recognize eminent scholars, and his later conduct strayed from the proper path. Shù Xián, known as Master Shù Xián, once served as prime minister to the Marquis of Qi. Dismissed from office over a matter, he walked along the road on foot when someone asked him: \"Master, how have you come to this?\" Shù Xián replied: \"I held a position as lofty as the tripod yet could not promote a single worthy man. I amassed wealth by the thousands yet could not relieve a single scholar. Now I have come to this.\"\n\nTo present treasures to the state is not as good as presenting worthy men. Those who advance the worthy receive the highest rewards; those who obscure the worthy incur the most severe punishments. Such was the foresight of the good ministers of old, and such is the bright mirror for later generations.\n\nFire generates flame when blown, and a mirror becomes reflective when polished. Without blowing, fire has no outward radiance; without polishing, a mirror lacks inner illumination. Thus, blowing is the brilliance of fire, and polishing the splendor of a mirror.\n\nIn this world of succession, one must rely on reputation to manifest one’s radiance, just as fire and mirror depend on blowing and polishing. Even if one’s wisdom equals that of Lǐ Lǐ or one’s talent rivals that of Master Jiǎ—Lǐ Lǐ was Lǐ Zǐ, younger brother of King Hui of Qin, named Zhuāng, who lived in Lǐ Lǐ and was called Master Lǐ Lǐ. Witty and resourceful, his contemporaries called him a man of wisdom. Master Jiǎ was Jiǎ Yì of Luòyáng, skilled in literary composition. His contemporaries said of him: \"Jiǎ Yì, the talent of Luòyáng, is as brilliant as Zhōng Jūn of the mountains and Miào of the east.\"—dwelling in a humble abode without a confidant to converse with, one’s renown cannot spread near or far, nor can one’s fame reach the heavens.\n\nHad Liǔ Xià Huì never met Confucius, his pure and steadfast conduct would not have been known, and he would have remained a thrice-dismissed minister, a man without shame. Had Jì Bù never met Cáo Qiū, his promise of a hundred gold would not have been celebrated—Jì Bù was a man of the Hàn dynasty. When Cáo Qiū met him, he said: \"I would rather have Jì Bù’s single promise than a hundred catties of gold.\"—and he would have remained an ordinary captive, a man without honor. The reason these two men’s virtue spread in their time and their fame endured for ten thousand generations was the blowing and polishing of sages and worthies.\n\nOnce, a man brought a fine horse to market, but after three mornings, no one took notice. He then said to Bó Lè: \"I have brought a fine horse to sell, yet no one in the market appreciates it. I beg you to glance at it once, and I will offer half its price in gratitude.\" Thereupon Bó Lè came to the market, approached the horse, and greeted it with admiration. As he departed, he turned back to gaze at it. In a single morning, the horse’s price rose to a thousand gold. This horse was no different from what it had been the day before—no dull colt transformed into a swift steed. It was only that no one had recognized its worth, nor had anyone given it a second glance.\n\nThe camphor tree, with its gnarled roots and hooked branches, its knotted nodes and worm-eaten bark, its twisted, swollen trunk—such a tree would go unnoticed by all. Yet when a craftsman selects it, shapes it into the beams of a palace hall, paints it with cinnabar and lacquer, and adorns it with patterns of quails and waterweeds, then the lords and ministers of the realm cannot help but gaze at it in admiration. The nature of the wood remains the same, yet what was once despised is now prized—this is the work of the skilled artisan.\n\nA luminous pearl from Xíngxī or a jade disk that glows at night—when presented to a lord or king, they must be stored in a jade casket and bound with golden clasps. But if one were to casually toss them to someone, that person would not even glance in surprise, but would grasp their sword in anger. The snake that carries the night-glowing pearl wishes to repay the Marquis of Suí. Yet if it were to suddenly appear before him, the marquis would be startled and reach for his sword in anger, ready to strike—all because it had come without cause.\n\nWhy? Because it had come without cause.\n\nIf a thing arrives with proper cause, then even a fine steed may toil in the stable’s enclosure—*yong* sounds like *chuàng*. The *zǎng*-trader is one who matches buyers in the marketplace; the *yuè*-inspector is he who examines horses in the open ground. Yet fine timber rots in secluded valleys, and precious pearls provoke the drawing of swords. But if they come with proper cause, then a fine steed may be prized at a thousand gold, camphorwood gleams in the purple hall, and pearls are cradled in jade caskets.\n\nNow, men of this generation, though they possess talent and wisdom, languish in obscurity and hardship, all for lack of proper cause. Without another to sing their praises or polish them with praise, they hope for their persons to shine and their names to be renowned—this is like groping at emptiness to bind the wind, like groping at emptiness and wishing to bind the wind. *Mén* means \"to feel.\" To grope at emptiness and wish to bind the wind. To boil water in search of snow—how could it be found?\n\n*Liuzi*, Scroll Four, concludes.\nVariant: *pìn* in the *Wenyuange* edition reads *sōu*.\nVariant: \"Because none in the past appreciated them, there were none to gaze upon them in admiration\" in the *Wenyuange* edition reads \"Because none in the past appreciated them, later there were those who gazed upon them in admiration.\"\n*Liuzi*, Scroll Five. Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Registrar of Bozhou.\n\n**Relying on Others, Twenty-One**\n\nAll creatures endowed with *qi* invariably rely on external forces to achieve their advantage. Thus, the frost-withered leaf clings to the autumn wind to gain its light ascent; the flying serpent attaches itself to the spring mist, aspiring to soar among the clouds; the shrew-mouse clings to the flea, striving to match the sun’s pace. In the West, there is a beast called the *shu*—its front resembles a rat, its rear a flea. When it halts, it crouches; when it runs, it bears the flea upon its back. If the rat is behind and the hare ahead, it cannot reach its food, so it must rely on the hare to feed it. Now, in Xiawu Mountain of Guangwu County in Yanmen, there are creatures like hares but larger, which carry one another as they move—these are called shrew-mice.\n\nThe green vine entwines the verdant pine to flourish as a cloud-reaching herb. If even the aspirations of birds, beasts, insects, and plants know to harness the wind, borrow the mist, rely on lofty heights, and cling to eminence to accomplish their ends, how much more should humans seek support to establish their names? Thus, those who rely on the wise and worthy will leave radiant traces and illustrious names, while those who attach themselves to the base and obscure will wither in body and rot in reputation.\n\nAt dawn’s first light—the visage of the sun’s emergence—even the faintest smoke can be discerned by the eye. As the year nears its end, the tumbleweed rolls within the clouds. The eye’s power to see and the tumbleweed’s power to rise come from relying on the sun’s radiance and the wind’s force.\n\nIf coral is set upon metal or iron and cast into rivers and lakes, it will surely sink, mired in mud and sand—not because its feather-light substance is heavy by nature, but because of what it relies upon. If a stone is placed in a boat and set upon rivers and lakes, it will cleave the wind, part the waves, and drift across vast waters—not because the stone’s substance is light by nature, but because of what it relies upon.\n\nThe gadfly that preys on oxen can fly no more than a hundred paces, yet if it clings to a phoenix’s tail, it may traverse ten thousand *li* in a single flutter—not because its wings are skilled, but because of what it relies upon for speed. Lou Ji’s feet were swift, able to chase the fleeing light...\n\nLou Ji was a man of antiquity famed for his running, able to chase down the fleeing light of a woman in flight—thus the saying. Yet if he were to mount a weary black steed, he could not cover even a single *she* in a day (twenty *li* make one *she*), for the horse was but a donkey’s kin. Not that his own pace was slow, but what he relied upon was feeble.\n\nThus we see: when one clings to the right support, even a heavy stone may float, and short wings may fly far; when one clings to the wrong support, even light feathers sink, and swift feet falter. The swallow’s nest, woven of mud and mended with care, gleams like embroidered silk—no master potter could craft its like, so firm is its structure. Yet when the triumphant army returns and the tent-flaps are torn away, the nest shatters and the fledglings perish, for what it relied upon was perilous. The quail’s nest, bound to a reed’s stem with strands of silk and pearls, woven in delicate patterns—no seamstress’s skill could rival its artistry, so firm is its construction. Yet when the gale arrives (a mere breeze, in truth), the reed snaps and the eggs break. Why? Because what it relied upon was weak and frail.\n\nThus the crow has the nature to choose its tree, and the fish the instinct to select its pool, striving for the finest perch or shoal—this is what makes them noble.\n\n**Heart’s Concealment, Twenty-Second**\nThe vastness of the Two Modes may be measured by celestial cycles (twenty-nine years mark one such span). The movements of the Three Bonds may be gauged by outward signs and inner measures. The thunder’s roar may be conveyed through drums, and the shifts of wind and rain harmonized through music. Thus, where there is form to observe, its shadow cannot be hidden; where there is shape to see, its trace cannot be concealed; where there is sound to hear, its echo cannot be silenced; where there is color to perceive, its nature cannot be erased. Even the obscurities of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang, may be inferred through calculation and known to ear and eye. Yet as for man: the heart dwells within, emotions lie concealed beneath, and they cannot be measured by reckoning.\n\nThe human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to fathom than Heaven itself. Heaven has its seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk, but man’s true nature is hidden behind a thick facade, his depths unknowable. Thus, the heart may be resolute while the countenance is gentle; the bearing strong while the essence is weak; the appearance sincere while the conduct is sluggish; the temper fiery yet the affairs drawn out. One may adorn the exterior to obscure the truth: joy need not mean affection, anger need not mean hatred, laughter need not mean delight, tears need not mean sorrow. Such concealed emotions and hidden deeds are not easily discerned.\n\nThe sun hangs beyond the heavens, yet the heart lies within man—yet even as things are illuminated without, falsehood may still arise within. The heart resides within man, and wisdom dwells deeper still, where the spirit also shines. Yet what is external offers no proof of what lies within, and to seek the truth is no easy task. Dirt upon the face is met with scorn, but dirt within the heart goes unashamed. The face is exposed without, while the heart lies hidden within, so one may polish one’s demeanor, conceal one’s cunning, and hide one’s wit, never to be seen in a lifetime.\n\nIn Lu, Shaozheng Mao lived at the same time as Confucius. Confucius’s disciples filled his gate three times and emptied it three times, yet Yan Yuan alone never left, for he alone recognized the Sage’s virtue. The disciples abandoned Confucius for Shaozheng Mao not because they failed to recognize Confucius’s sagacity, but because they failed to recognize Shaozheng Mao’s deceit. Zigong said, “Shaozheng Mao is a learned man of Lu. If you, Master, were to take office, why would you put him first?” Confucius replied, “Ci, this is not a matter you can grasp.” For Shaozheng Mao’s heart was perverse yet restrained, his words cunning and contentious (his eloquence was as sharp as a beacon’s flame, his strength as fierce as a blade). His speech was false yet persuasive, his words coarse yet expansive, and he made the wrong seem smooth. Possessing these five deceptions, he confused even the worthy. Zigong’s keen insight could not perceive it—how much harder, then, to know others!\n\nThus we see: flattery resembles virtue, deceit resembles trust, eloquence resembles wisdom, and foolish honesty resembles sincerity—just as *jiwei* is mistaken for ginseng, and *shechuang* for *mowu* (the latter being today’s *shouqiong*). Common custom holds that none do not value themselves and despise others, esteem themselves and belittle others. In their minds, they do not merely seek to outwit the worthy or impose the inferior upon the superior. Yet because the human heart is so hard to know, it cannot be weighed by any standard. Unable to empty themselves and defer to others, they end up slighting the weighty and overpowering the long. Thus, the crone by the well boasts that her beauty surpasses Xi Shi’s, and Duke Huan of Qi vaunts his virtue above Yao and Shun’s. Even Zigong, when he first studied under Confucius, after one year claimed to have surpassed him, after two years deemed himself his equal, and only after three years realized he fell short. If Zigong, with all his talent, could not recognize the Sage’s virtue until he had glimpsed it from afar, how can ordinary men be expected to humble themselves?\n\nThus, truth and falsehood intertwine, the worthy and the foolish mingle, and without true wisdom, none can distinguish them. When Shaozheng Mao, a minister of Lu, plotted rebellion, Confucius, then serving as Minister of Crime, said to Duke Ding of Lu, “A man bold and cunning—this is one who brings chaos to the realm. You must execute him.” And so Duke Ding put Shaozheng Mao to death.\n\n**Fortune’s Block and Flow, Twenty-Third**\nFate knows adversity and prosperity, encounters know setback and success. Adversity and prosperity are opposites, setback and success follow different paths. Prosperity and success do not depend solely on wisdom, nor do adversity and setback arise from mere dullness. Why? Prosperity and adversity stem from fate, while setback and success lie in encounter. When fate brings setback, talent flows only to be dammed; when encounter brings success, talent dammed flows freely.\n\nThe unfulfilled flow is not summoned by one’s own strength;\nThe onset of blockage—how could it be turned back by wisdom alone?\nIf circumstances lean toward blockage, then mouth and eyes are both sealed;\nIf encounter aligns with flow, then voice and gaze shine forth together.\n\nThus, shouting from a cave, the sound chokes within a few yards;\nCalling with the wind, the echo carries a hundred miles.\nGazing from a well, the sky appears no wider than a round lid;\nClimbing a peak, the eye reaches only to the misty horizon.\nYet when one was in the well or cave,\nthe voice had not suddenly grown hoarse,\nthe eye had not abruptly dimmed—\nwhat limited hearing and sight was the blockage of circumstance.\n\nAnd when one rides the wind or treads the summit,\nthe voice is not that of Meng Ben,\nthe ancient man of great strength,\nthe eye is not that of Li Lou,\nthe ancient man of keen vision—\nyet the echo rings clear and the gaze stretches far,\nfor the circumstance is one of flow.\n\nMai Chen endured hunger while singing on the road;\nWang Zhang wept in the cold while sitting in rags;\nSu Qin gripped an awl in frustration;\nBan Chao clenched a brush with indignation.\nThe son of the Prefect of Xu was later enfeoffed by Gaozu as the Marquis of Dingyuan.\nWhen these four men were in straitened circumstances,\ntheir complexions darkened, their spirits withered,\ntheir words became like shards, their conduct like that of madmen.\nTheir inner sorrow showed in their faces,\ntheir sighs rolled like thunder, their breath surged like clouds.\nLike a qilin harnessed to a heavy chariot,\nor a black ape bound in a cage,\nthey were not without the swiftness of a thousand *li*,\nthe agility of ten thousand fathoms—\nyet they differed not from the weak and dull,\nfor there was no place to display their skill.\nHow different was this from gazing from a cave and hoping for a far-reaching voice,\nor peering from a well and desiring a broad view?\n\nBut when their circumstances flowed and their ambitions were fulfilled,\nsome returned home in embroidered robes,\nsome voiced jade-like counsel in the imperial court.\nZhu Mai Chen, poor and lowly in his youth, gathering firewood,\nlater entered the Han and became governor of his home commandery,\nreturning in embroidered robes.\nWang Zhang, poor and lowly in his youth, weeping in ox-hide rags,\nlater served the Han as Prefect of the Capital,\na constant presence in the court.\nSome formed alliances within the six states:\nSu Qin, styled Jizi, was a man of Luoyang in Qinzhou.\nIn his youth, he studied under Master Guigu alongside Zhang Yi,\nthe two being equal in talent and renown.\nSu Qin first traveled to persuade the six states,\nbut after three years returned with his gold spent and his name unheard.\nWhen he came home,\nhis countenance was downcast,\nhis sister-in-law refused to cook,\nhis wife would not descend from her loom,\nhis parents and brothers would not speak to him.\nSu Qin then read the *Yin Fu* of the Grand Duke in his home.\nAfter several months, he again served Zhao and became chancellor.\nAt that time, the six states were weak and constantly feared Qin’s encroachment,\nall turning their courts toward Qin.\nSu Qin then advocated the vertical alliance of the six states to resist Qin,\nwhile Qin sought to annex the six states through horizontal alliances.\nSu Qin said to the King of Zhao:\n“Now the world believes in horizontal alliances,\nwhile the six states form a vertical one.\nIf none serve Qin and Qin raises its troops,\nthe six states will unite to strike it—\nthe six states will be secure, and Qin will achieve nothing.”\nThe King of Zhao agreed,\nand Su Qin then persuaded the six states,\nallying Cao, Wei, Yan, Qi, Zhao, and Chu in a vertical alliance,\nrefusing to serve Qin—for twenty years.\nLater, Su Qin died,\nand Zhang Yi became chancellor of Qin.\nHe then persuaded the six states, saying:\n“Su Qin’s words were deceitful,\nturning wrong into right and right into wrong.\nHis vertical alliance of the six states against Qin is no long-term strategy.\nBy the standards of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*,\nthe small not serving the great is no foundation for a secure state.”\nThus, the vertical alliance was broken, and the horizontal one restored.\nLater, Qin annexed all under heaven,\nleading to the First Emperor’s burning of the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*,\nand the burying alive of scholars—an offense against the divine.\nAfter the First Emperor’s death,\nhe was buried at Mount Li.\nThree generations later, his descendant Ziying surrendered to Gaozu of Han at the Ford of Wu.\n\nSome hung their banners beyond Kunlun:\nBan Chao, poor and lowly in his youth,\nonce worked as a scribe for hire.\nWhen the Han campaigned against the Xiongnu,\nBan Chao cast aside his brush and joined the army,\nserving in the Western Regions.\nHe achieved merit and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dingyuan.\nOnly after thirty years did he return home—\nyoung and strong when he left, white-haired upon his return.\n\nAt such times,\ntheir countenances shone with radiance,\ntheir spirits flourished,\ntheir words became like gold and jade,\ntheir conduct set the standard for the age.\nRiding fat horses and wearing light robes,\nthey were at ease and content,\nas swift as a light swan riding the long wind,\nas free as a great fish swimming in the vast abyss.\nHow different was this from calling with the wind and letting the voice soar,\nor climbing a peak and gazing afar?\n\nThe men were the same,\nyet in the past they were thus, now they are so—\nnot because they were foolish then and wise now,\nor ugly then and beautiful now,\nbut because of blockage and flow.\n\nWater’s nature is clarity.\nWhen dammed by a dike, its waves churn and its qi rots;\nwhen released to flow, following its course,\nturning with the ravine,\neven rotten bones and decayed treasures cannot pollute it.\nIt is not the water’s nature that changes—\nit is the difference between flow and blockage.\n\nA man’s flow is like water’s flow.\nVirtue is like a cold spring:\neven if sand and dust fall into it, they cannot defile it.\nFrom this we see:\nthe paths of flow and blockage,\nthe appearances of glory and withering,\nare worlds apart.\n\n**Encounter and Non-Encounter, Twenty-Fourth**\nVirtue has its constant quality,\nencounter has its constant portion.\nVirtue or lack thereof lies in nature;\nencounter or lack thereof lies in fate.\nNature is manifest in man,\nso worthiness and foolishness can be determined;\nfate rests with Heaven,\nso prosperity and adversity cannot be foreseen.\n\nWhen fate’s course is hard to encounter,\ndanger does not necessarily bring disaster,\nfoolishness does not necessarily bring poverty;\nwhen fate’s course is not encountered,\nsafety does not necessarily bring fortune,\nworthiness does not necessarily bring success.\nThus, those who share the same suffering yet differ in life and death,\nthose who share the same virtue yet differ in glory and disgrace—\nthis is due to encounter and non-encounter.\n\nThe spring sun graces the sky, yet the hidden are not illuminated;\nautumn frost covers the earth, yet the sheltered are not harmed—\nthis is encounter and non-encounter.\n\nLong ago, Marquis Zhao of Han drank outside and grew cold.\nAn attendant draped a robe over him.\nWhen he awoke and asked about it,\nhe learned that the attendant had shown affection for him,\nand for overstepping his duties, he was executed.\n\nIn Wei, Jiao Sheng observed the charioteer’s error and called out from behind to halt the carriage, intending to avert danger—yet he incurred no punishment. The attendant who draped a robe feared his lord’s cold; the one who called out to stop the chariot feared his lord’s peril. Their loyalty and affection were the same, their transgression of duty equal—yet the attendant was punished, while the caller was deemed virtuous. This was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nWhen a magpie dropped a rotting rat, it was not the Yu family’s insult. The Yu sisters were feasting in their tower when a wandering swordsman passed below. Just then, an old magpie mid-flight let fall a rat, which happened to land as the Yu sisters burst into laughter. The swordsman mistook their laughter as mockery directed at him, believing they had dropped the filthy thing to humiliate him. Enraged, he slaughtered the entire Yu family.\n\nWhen a jar of water was poured onto the ground, it was not She Gu’s filth. The incident was unforeseen, and thus not his fault—yet the swordsman flew into a rage, and the Yu family was annihilated. When the lord of Zhu grew furious, She Gu escaped death. The lord of Zhu, ruler of the state, had risen drunk with She Gu. A gatekeeper, seeking money for wine, asked She Gu for some, but She Gu refused. The gatekeeper, nursing malice, knew the lord’s temper and poured a basin of water onto the threshold. When the lord emerged and asked why the ground was wet, the gatekeeper lied, “She Gu urinated here.” The lord, quick to anger, immediately ordered She Gu beaten to death, declaring, “He shall fall into a pit of fire and perish!” Yet She Gu survived. This, too, was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nIn Qi, Hua Shi retired to the hills and valleys, and the Grand Duke executed him. In Wei, Gan Mu secluded himself in obscurity, and Marquis Wen honored him. When Marquis Wen of Wei visited Gan Mu’s retreat, he remarked, “This is not Gan Mu’s dwelling.” Hearing that Gan Mu refused to serve him, the marquis said, “How dare I not show respect?” Gan Mu excelled in virtue; the marquis excelled in territory. Gan Mu was rich in righteousness; the marquis was rich in wealth. Yet land and wealth cannot compare to virtue and righteousness. Thus, the marquis treated him with the reverence due a teacher—how much more so with honor? He bestowed upon him a generous stipend. Later, when Qin rebelled, Qin’s marshal Tang Ju cautioned, “In Wei there is a man named Gan Mu, abundant in virtue and righteousness. Marquis Wen honors him, and thus the people’s hearts are won. We cannot invade.” Qin then withdrew its troops and refrained from aggression.\n\nThe Grand Duke’s wisdom was no greater than Marquis Wen’s, nor did Gan Mu’s virtue surpass Hua Shi’s—yet one was honored, the other executed. This was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nDong Zhongshu’s wisdom and virtue crowned his generation, yet his rank barely exceeded that of a scholar. Dong Zhongshu was a native of Guangchuan, well-versed in all the classics, with answers to every question. He served the Han and rose to the position of Grand Master of Palace Leisure.\n\nTian Qianqiu had no extraordinary conduct, yet a single word won him the post of prime minister. The elderly Hu Guan, surnamed Tian and named Qianqiu, was eighty years old. Emperor Wu of Han, in his later years, grew suspicious and weary of his ministers’ prayers and supplications. He dispatched Jiang Chong to root out sorcery and malevolent qi. Jiang Chong bore ill will toward the crown prince. Fearing that the prince would succeed the emperor, he falsely accused the prince of burying a bronze figurine beneath the imperial bed to curse the emperor. He then had a shaman falsely claim that the palace was tainted with malevolent qi. The emperor sent Jiang Chong to investigate, and upon digging beneath the bed, they uncovered the bronze figurine. Jiang Chong declared it proof of the prince’s treachery.\n\nThe prince’s tutor, fearing punishment, advised the prince, “Jiang Chong and the shaman have found the bronze figurine. We cannot know if it is real. Without proof of your innocence, you must seize Jiang Chong and interrogate him to uncover the truth.” The prince then mobilized his forces, killed Jiang Chong, and burned his body. The shaman, under duress, confessed to Jiang Chong’s scheme against the prince. At the time, the emperor was at the Ganquan Palace. Liu Quli rushed to report, “The prince has rebelled and killed Jiang Chong!” The emperor immediately dispatched troops to besiege the prince. The prince resisted with his own forces, and battle erupted in Chang’an. The prince fled.\n\nThree days later, Tian Qianqiu submitted a memorial pleading for the prince: “Jiang Chong was wicked, fabricating sorcery to frame the prince. The prince had no intent to rebel. A son may take up his father’s weapons to save his life. The prince is innocent; he should be recalled.” The emperor, in his old age, longed for the prince and sent men to search for him. By then, the prince had already died. Moved by Tian Qianqiu’s words, the emperor appointed him prime minister—thus, a single word won him the post.\n\nLiu Quli commanded the troops of the Three Auxiliaries—Left Fengyi, Right Fufeng, and the capital district—against the prince. The prince was defeated, fled to the city, and hanged himself. Later, learning the prince had no treacherous intent, the emperor built the Tower of Longing for His Son.\n\nThose who serve the same enlightened ruler yet find themselves divided by vast disparities in rank and fortune do so by virtue of *encounter* or the lack thereof. When Zhuang Jiang married into Wei, though beautiful, she found no favor; when the hunchbacked woman married into Qi, though ugly, she enjoyed the king’s favor. In Qi there was a hunchbacked girl who, while gathering mulberry leaves in the fields, chanced upon the king’s outing. All the others came to gaze upon the king, but the hunchbacked girl alone did not look. The king sent someone to ask, “Everyone else is looking at the king—why do you alone refuse?” She replied, “I was sent by my parents only to gather leaves. They did not instruct me to look at the king, so I dare not.” The king then said, “This girl is truly virtuous.” He wished to take her back to the capital in his carriage. The girl said, “If the king wishes to take me, I dare not refuse. But if I were to follow you now, I would be a runaway girl—this is why I cannot go.” Later, the king sent gifts of silk and treasure to formally betroth her. As she entered the capital, the palace women and concubines, hearing that the king’s new consort had been found while gathering mulberry leaves, came to see her. When they beheld her—ugly and hunchbacked—they all laughed at her. Yet she became the king’s most favored.\n\nWhether one meets with good fortune or not is a matter of *ming* (destiny); whether one is worthy or not is a matter of *xing* (innate nature). To resent one’s lack of worth is to fail to understand *xing*; to lament one’s ill fortune is to fail to comprehend *ming*. If one can face adversity without fear and endure poverty and low status without sorrow, one may be called one who has mastered *ming*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Destiny and Physiognomy**\n*Ming* (destiny) is the root of life, while *xiang* (physiognomy) assists in its fulfillment. Destiny may exist without manifesting in form, but physiognomy is always expressed in form. Where there is destiny, there must be physiognomy; where there is physiognomy, there must be destiny. Both are bestowed by Heaven and depend upon each other to take shape.\n\nA person’s destiny and physiognomy determine their worth, rank, longevity, and fortune, shaped by *qi* at the moment of conception. At the time of birth, the most wondrous may be influenced by the Five Phases and the Three Luminaries, or by the traces of dragons, auspicious *qi*, or prophetic dreams. Even ordinary people receive their destiny from Heaven, governed by the stars—those who align with auspicious constellations prosper, while those who align with inauspicious ones suffer misfortune.\n\nOnce the *qi* is received and destiny is fixed, neither ghosts nor spirits can alter it, nor can sages or wise men reverse it. Huaxu stepped in the giant’s footprint and gave birth to Fuxi; Nüwa was moved by the radiant light piercing the sun and bore Zhuanxu; Qingdu coupled with the Red Dragon and gave birth to Tang Yao; Wodeng saw the great rainbow and bore Shun; Xiuli witnessed the falling star and bore Yu of Xia; Fudu saw the white *qi* piercing the moon and bore Tang of Yin; Tairen dreamed of a tall man and bore King Wen; Yan Zheng was moved by the Black Emperor and bore Confucius; and Liu Ao was moved by the Red Dragon and bore the Han founder. Weizi was influenced by the Star of the Oxherd, Yan Yuan by the Central Terrace Star, Zhang Liang by the Fox Star, Fan Kuai by the Wolf Star, and Laozi by the Fire Star—all such sages and worthies were born under celestial omens.\n\nPhysiognomy may be discerned in flesh and bone, or in voice and complexion. Worth, rank, longevity, and fortune all leave external signs. Thus, the Five Peaks rise with towering majesty; the Four Rivers flow with crystalline purity; the Five Colors flourish like radiant clouds; and the Five Tones resound like bells and chimes. Those skilled in observation are like Fenghu distinguishing swords—Fenghu was a sword appraiser of Qin—or Sun Yang judging horses—Sun Yang was Bo Le, the famed horse physiognomer. To grasp their subtle principles is no easy task.\n\nFuxi had a horned forehead; the Yellow Emperor, a dragon’s countenance; Emperor Ku, shoulders like a bear’s; Zhuanxu, fused cheekbones; Yao, eyebrows of eight hues; Shun, double pupils; Yu, ears with three openings; Tang, arms with two elbows; King Wen, four nipples; King Wu, teeth like coins; Confucius, a reversed roof; Yan Hui, double pupils; Gaoyao, a raven’s beak—all such sages and worthies were born with extraordinary features. Shun’s double pupils were a sign of supreme clarity, yet Xiang Yu and Wang Mang also had double pupils. King Goujian of Yue had a long neck and a raven’s beak, an omen of an unpeaceful end, yet Yu of Xia shared the same features. Wang Mang’s double pupils were like a nag with a single hair of a fine steed—it cannot be called a steed. Yu’s long neck and raven’s beak were like a dragon with a single scale of a snake—it cannot be called a snake.\n\nEven among the common people, all possess signs of their destiny. Thus, the son of the Lord of Lu, Guzi, had a broad lower face, and Shu Xing, skilled in physiognomy, knew he would have descendants. Guzi was the son of the Lord of Lu; Gu was his surname. At birth, his upper face was narrow and his lower face broad. Shu Xing, adept in physiognomy, divined, “This man has an auspicious appearance.” Later, he indeed became king of Lu. *Dui* and *Feng* are hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*.\n\nWei Qing had a square forehead, and Jing Tuo predicted his wealth and nobility. Wei Qing’s father had secretly consorted with a palace maid, and Wei Qing was born. When he grew up, the household of the princess treated him as a slave, mocking him and ordering him to tend horses with the black slaves. Jing Tuo said to Wei Qing, “Your forehead is square—you are destined for nobility.” Wei Qing replied, “Now I am a slave—what nobility can there be?” Later, he became skilled in archery and horsemanship. When the Han sought to destroy the Xiongnu, Wei Qing enlisted and, through his merits in campaigning against the Xiongnu, was enfeoffed as Grand General and established a marquisate.\n\nZhou Yafu had vertical lines on his forehead, and Xu Fu predicted he would starve to death. Yafu, whose surname was Zhou and given name Yafu, was the third son of Zhou Bo and served as the General of Fine Willows. Xu Fu examined his physiognomy and said, “Vertical lines enter the forehead—later, you will die of starvation.” Yafu was later imprisoned on false charges and starved to death after seven days without food, just as Xu Fu had foretold.\n\nYang Fen’s cry was like a jackal’s, and his grandmother, Shu Ji, foresaw the destruction of his clan. Yang Fen was a grandee of Jin. When he was born, his grandmother, Shu Ji, went to hear his cry. The infant wailed like a jackal, and Shu Ji said, “This child’s cry is like a jackal’s—he will bring ruin to our clan.” She turned away and refused to see him. When he grew up, he indeed caused great chaos in Jin. In the fifth month of summer, he was killed by the Jin, and his entire clan was exterminated.\n\nFate and fortune in physiognomy hang upon Heaven. If one’s destiny is to be poor and lowly, even if noble, misfortune will still befall; if one’s destiny is to be rich and noble, even if one seeks to destroy them, harm cannot be done. When Xia’s Kong Jia hunted on Mount Ji, a great wind arose, darkening the sky, and he entered a household. The master’s wife was then giving birth, and someone divined: “One born after the arrival of a guest is inauspicious—this child will surely bring calamity.” Kong Jia took the child and said: “If he is to be my son, who would dare bring him calamity?” When the child grew up, he split firewood with an axe and severed his left foot, then became a great musician. Kong Jia said: “Alas, this is the decree of fate.”\n\nEmperor Wen of Han favored Deng Tong because of a dream. The emperor dreamed of falling into a well and being saved by Deng Tong, and thereafter bestowed great favor upon him. A physiognomer divined that Deng Tong would die in poverty and starvation. The emperor said: “Whether he is rich depends on me—how could he be poor?” He granted him a copper mountain, allowing him exclusive rights to cast coins. Later, Deng Tong borrowed clothes and food and died as a dependent in another’s home.\n\nWhen Ziwen was born, he was abandoned as an inauspicious child. Yun was originally a descendant of Zhurong, though his surname was unknown. Ziwen was the son of Guobo Bi. Bi’s father died early, and he followed his mother to live in his maternal uncle’s home. When he grew up, he seduced the daughter of Yunzi, and she bore Ziwen. Yunzi’s wife, ashamed that her daughter had conceived out of wedlock, abandoned the child in the mountains. Yunzi went hunting and saw a tiger nursing an infant. He returned and told his wife, who said: “This must be the child my daughter bore with Guobo Bi. I was indignant and sent him to the mountains.” Yunzi then retrieved the child, raised him, and betrothed his daughter to Guobo Bi. The people of Chu called Ziwen “Gu Wutu,” and he later became the Prime Minister of Chu. A tiger had nursed him, and thus he was taken in and raised, eventually rising to become Prime Minister.\n\nIn the kingdom of Baoli, a maidservant of the king became pregnant, and the king sought to kill her. The maid said: “Qi descended from Heaven, and thus I conceived.” When the child was born, he was cast into a pigsty. The pigs breathed upon him with their qi. He was then abandoned in a horse stable, and the horses also breathed upon him, so he did not die. He ultimately became the king of Fuyu.\n\nThus, the fate of good and evil descends as if from Heaven or emerges as if from the earth—it cannot be deduced by reason or calculation, nor can it be seized by wisdom or strength. Now, people do not understand that fate is limited and yet vainly covet excess; their destiny lies in poverty and lowliness, yet they scheme for wealth and nobility; their destiny lies in early death, yet they seek longevity in the face of peril—all are deeply deluded.\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Five, End*\n*Commentary by Yuan Xiaozheng, Record Keeper and Assistant Magistrate of Bozhou*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Folly of Fault-Finding**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is formless and silent, invisible to the eye and inaudible to the ear. It cannot be sought through echoes or shadows, nor can it be described by praise or blame. From this truth onward, no affair attains perfect beauty, no reputation achieves unblemished glory. Even the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the radiance of the Three Luminaries, and the wisdom of sages and worthies are not exempt from censure.\n\nThus, Heaven bears the omen of rifts, Earth the form of fissures; the sun and moon suffer eclipses, the five planets harbor comets and baleful stars. Yao was slandered for lacking filial piety, Shun for imprisoning his father; Tang was branded for exiling his lord, King Wu for slaying his sovereign. Duke Huan of Qi was reviled for greed and debauchery, Duke Wen of Jin for disloyalty; Yi Yin was accused of deceiving his ruler, Guan Zhong of usurping his superior. If even the divine spirits of the Two Modes and Seven Luminaries cannot avoid the slightest flaw, if the sagely kings Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu cannot escape suspicion and slander, and if the worthy Duke Huan and Yi Yin and Guan Zhong cannot be free of minor faults—how then can the scholars of the world hope to avoid resentment and reproach, or live without regret and fear?\n\nThus, the jade of Jing’s peaks must bear tiny flaws, and the pearl of the black dragon may have a slight blemish. The Dragon King of the sea possesses a luminous moon-pearl beneath his chin. This dragon dwells in the depths of the ninefold abyss. Once, a child from a seaside village passed by and, finding the dragon’s gate open, entered his palace. The dragon was asleep, so the child stole the moon-pearl from beneath his chin. Though the pearl’s value was beyond price, its slight imperfection led the villagers to fear the child might return to the ninefold abyss and be poisoned by the dragon. When they called out to him, the child, facing them, crushed the moon-pearl to pieces. Yet its brilliance had already shone for a thousand years, and its worth had soared among kings and lords—all because a minor flaw could not mar its great beauty.\n\nNow, those who resent others’ petty shortcomings and envy their strengths will never attract the worthy. To seek talent thus is like searching for footprints in an empty book or a path in spilled water—it cannot be done. Even the ministers who stabilize a state have minor flaws; the ruler does not discard them because he does not allow small matters to obstruct great ones. To let the small obscure the great is no way to seek men of ability.\n\nYi Yin was but a cook in Xia; Fu Yue, a convict laborer in Yin; Baili Xi, a fugitive slave of Yu; and Duan Ganmu, a merchant in Jin. Ganmu, a native of Jin, was a broker who traded in goods and never sought office. When Marquis Wen of Wei learned of his worth, he went to Ganmu’s home to recruit him. Ganmu remained seated and did not rise, yet the marquis stood respectfully by his side, too awed to grow weary. He then appointed Ganmu as his prime minister. Later, when Duke Jian of Qin sought to attack Wei, he feared Ganmu’s great wisdom and the strategies he would devise for Marquis Wen, so he abandoned his campaign. Though these four men were undeniably worthy, their origins were not without stain.\n\nNo reputation attains dual glory, no affair achieves perfect beauty. Once, Marquis Wen of Wei asked Li Ke, “What sort of man is Wu Qi?” Wu Qi, a native of Wei, had sought office in Chu. He bit his mother’s arm to swear an oath that he would not return for nine years, but when his mother died, he still did not go home. A minister of Chu said to the king, “Wu Qi did not return for his mother’s funeral—this is unfilial. How can he be made a minister?” Wu Qi then returned home to observe three years of mourning before going to Wei to seek office. Marquis Wen appointed him governor of Xihe. The marquis had previously lost five cities to Qin, but Wu Qi recovered them. He then led a campaign against Qin, reclaiming the five cities for Wei, and later conquered Yan and Zhao in the north, bringing them under Wei’s rule—all through Wu Qi’s merit.\n\nLi Ke replied, “Wu Qi is greedy and lustful, yet in his command of troops, even Sima Rangju cannot surpass him.” The marquis thus made him a general. The recapture of Qin’s five cities and the conquest of Yan and Zhao were all due to Wu Qi’s efforts.\n\nWhen Wei Wuzi recommended Chen Ping to the King of Han, someone slandered him, saying, “Though Chen Ping is a man, he is as beautiful as jade on a cap—his outward appearance may be fine, but his inner worth is doubtful. Moreover, I hear he seduced his sister-in-law and accepted bribes.” The king then distanced himself from Chen Ping and reproached Wei Wuzi. Wuzi said, “I recommended a man of extraordinary strategies, one whose counsel is truly sufficient to benefit the state. What do his minor faults matter to the great affairs of the realm?” The king then promoted Chen Ping to the rank of protector-general, allowing him to implement his plans. Thus, when Xiang Yu’s advisor Fan Zeng died of a carbuncle and Chu perished, and when the Han army was saved by the opening of the enemy’s ranks—these were all due to Chen Ping’s schemes.\n\nFan Zeng was a great minister of Chu. When Xiang Yu besieged the King of Han in his city, Chen Ping devised a plan to send precious treasures to Chu’s generals. The King of Chu learned of this and sought to execute them. Fan Zeng advised, “This is Chen Ping’s scheme—do not kill them.” The king said, “A warrior who loses his loyalty and accepts another’s wealth—how can he be a minister?” He then executed them, and Fan Zeng died of a carbuncle. Chen Ping also carved wooden figures, dressed them in silk and fine robes, and placed them on the city walls as beautiful women, claiming they were beauties to be given to the Xiongnu chanyu. The chanyu’s wife, Lady Ban, heard of this and, fearing the chanyu would favor these women, opened the ranks to rescue the Han army. All these were Chen Ping’s stratagems.\n\nThe High Ancestor overlooked Chen Ping’s minor transgressions and adopted his six extraordinary strategies; Marquis Wen disregarded Wu Qi’s small faults and gained the merit of five cities. Had these two rulers dismissed such worthy men for their minor flaws, the survival of Wei and the outcome of the struggle between Han and Chu would have been uncertain. Wu Qi would have been buried in infamy for his greed and lust, and Chen Ping would have been ruined by accusations of bribery and theft.\n\nYet when the world observes scholars, it sees only their meticulous demeanor and fondness for trivial purity, and calls them men of talent. If a scholar has grand aspirations but neglects his appearance, or if his bearing is careless and his manners slightly unrefined, he is dismissed as worthless.\n\nTo see a single worm-eaten jujube and thus fell the entire tree; to spy a single stain on a bolt of brocade and cast the whole length into the refuse. Duke Huan of Qi deeply understood Yu Qi and was about to entrust him with governance. His ministers all slandered him, saying: \"Yu Qi is a man of Wei, not far from Qi. Your Lordship may send someone to inquire about him. If he is truly worthy, it will not be too late to employ him.\" The Duke said: \"Not so. I fear that if he has minor flaws, the people will know only his small faults and forget his great virtues—this is how the world loses its finest men.\" That very night, he raised torches and enfeoffed Yu Qi, making him chief minister. Nine times he assembled the feudal lords, and once he rectified the realm. Duke Huan may truly be called one who knew how to seek out worthy men.\n\nThus Confucius, upon seeing a single virtue in a man, would forget his hundred faults; while Bao Shu, upon hearing of a single transgression, would remember it for a lifetime. The Master was so magnanimous, Bao Shu so narrow-minded. From this we see how vastly the capacity of sages and worthies differs.\n\nDrizzling rain does not nourish the finest grain; the nest of a swallow cannot hold the egg of a magpie. Lofty mountains and vast marshes do not reject filth and muck; true talents who assist the age are not bound by trivial conduct. Why is this? A small measure cannot contain great form; a great vessel does not distinguish minor flaws.\n\nHuman nature invariably has its petty shortcomings. If a man is broadly right, even if he has small blemishes, they are not enough to be a hindrance. If he is broadly wrong, even if he has a humble gate—crossed timbers for a door, meaning the gate at the head of an alley—his petty conduct is not worth discussing in matters of grand strategy.\n\nFan Kuai was a butcher and peddler; Xiao He and Cao Shen were petty clerks—when Xiao He and Cao Shen were young, they served as lowly functionaries, so poor their wives could not be counted. Ying Bu was a convict branded with ink. All were men of servile rank.\n\nWithin the gates of the royal offices, each gate was guarded by four men, who opened and closed them at dawn and dusk. Convicts marked by ink from penal servitude were assigned to guard these gates—not the gates of private households. Unless the lord of the state had departed the palace, these guards were known as the *liwei* of the official gates. The *liwei* consisted of two men, one on the left and one on the right, walking apart from each other, one halberd held before and one behind, for their own defense.\n\nYing Bu, surnamed Ying and named Bu, in his youth had his fortune told by a physiognomist, who declared: \"First you will be branded, later you will become a king.\" The \"branding\" referred to the punishment of ink. Later, Ying Bu was indeed convicted and tattooed, reduced to the lowly post of a gate guard. He laughed and said, \"The physiognomist spoke truly.\" Subsequently, when Xiang Yu and the High Ancestor contended for the realm, Ying Bu was enfeoffed as the King of Jiujiang.\n\nZhou Bo held the role of *paiyou*—*paiyou* being the name for performers of comic arts. In the Jin era, there was You Yu; the *Records of the Grand Historian*’s \"Biographies of the Jesters\" mentions You Meng. All such *you* were renowned for their skill in theatrical performances. The *Jijiupian* states: \"To sing is *you*; to jest is *pai*.\" *Paiyou* is thus a single thing with two names, referring to those who perform in the miscellaneous entertainments, uttering amusing words. In his youth, Zhou Bo was a *paiyou* and a roguish lad, skilled in playing the xiao and various wind and string instruments. He often performed as a *paiyou* at funerals, a man of humble station. Later, he became the Right Chancellor to the High Ancestor of Han, his talent surpassing all in the court, none able to rival him. His conduct accorded with the law, and his nature was that of a general and minister.\n\nZhang Jingyang, though a great libertine of Yingzhong, overawed the feudal lords; Yan Zhuozou, though a notorious bandit of Liangfu—a native of Qi who led the Red Eyebrows in Daliang and later became a high minister to Duke Jing—rose to become a meritorious minister of Qi. All had their flaws, yet their fame and achievements endured because they grasped the grand strategy.\n\nYuan Jingmu—a man of Chu—collapsed from hunger by the roadside. A passerby offered him food and fed him. Jingmu asked, “Who are you to give me food?” The man replied, “I am the bandit father of Huqiu.” Jingmu said, “Since you are the bandit father of Huqiu, I will not eat food tainted by injustice.” He pressed his hands to the ground, vomited the food, and died.\n\nBao Jiao—also known as Bao Sheng—wore no silk or hemp, ate no grains, and carried a basket to gather wild fruits for sustenance. Zigong passed him on the road and asked, “Why have you come to this?” Jiao replied, “I have heard that to persist in the Dao when unrecognized is a withered path, and to ceaselessly seek office when spurned by those above is to destroy one’s integrity. To pursue profit while one’s conduct withers and one’s integrity crumbles—this is what I find shameful.” Zigong said, “I have heard that those who do not belong to an age do not enjoy its benefits, and those who defile their lord do not tread its soil. How much less should one eat its vegetables?” Bao Jiao said, “I have heard that the worthy value advancement and lightly regard retreat, while the incorruptible readily embrace death over dishonor.” He then cast himself beneath a bridge and drowned in the Luo River. Lu Zhonglian remarked: “Bao Jiao could not adapt to the world and brought about his own death—this was not the way of a true man. Though he upheld his principles and refused food tainted by injustice, starving to death without achieving great deeds to save the drowning, his minor integrity prevailed while his greater integrity faltered.”\n\nBoyi and Shuqi, pure as ice and jade, refused to succeed the lord of Guzhu, would not eat the grain of Zhou, and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. Yang Zhu preserved his life and nurtured his nature, avoiding profit and harm. When asked, “Would you pluck a single hair from your body to benefit the world?” he replied, “The world’s affairs cannot be saved by a single hair.” If it were Mozi, who embodied benevolence, grinding his body from head to foot for the world’s benefit, he would do so. Though these two followed different paths, their renown was the same: they would not sacrifice even a hair to benefit the world. Though their virtue was not lacking and their conduct lofty, could they have brought peace to their age, trodden the blade’s edge, and achieved lasting fame? Their example may serve as a model for all generations, yet they were unfit for the offices of Yi Yin or Guan Zhong.\n\n**Section Twenty-Seven: Aptitude**\n\nThings have their beauty and ugliness, and their uses must be fitting. Beauty is not always prized, nor is ugliness forever discarded. Purple sable and white fox, fashioned into fur robes, shimmer like auspicious clouds and gleam like carved jade—this is the beauty of noble attire. Coarse reeds and rushes, woven into rain capes and hats, appear sparse and plain, dark as rotting wood—this is the ugliness of plant-fiber garments. Though fur and straw differ, they equally clothe the body; though beauty and ugliness diverge, their utility is the same when apt.\n\nNow, in a chamber of embroidered curtains, a rain cape is no match for a fur robe; in snow and rain, a fur robe cannot compare to a rain cape. From this, we see that aptitude in application, suited to the moment, fulfills its purpose—each has its proper use.\n\nDuring the winter and summer festivals, when people gather in joy, they sing *Cai Ling*; when hauling stones or towing boats—whether by pulling ropes or guiding vessels—they chant *xu’ao*. Though these songs have their stirring melodies, they are set aside when the task demands strength, for *xu’ao* is more fitting. When Bian Zhuangzi ascended the court of Yin, his jade pendants chimed, his demeanor was warm, and his voice gentle. Yet when he wrestled a tiger, he rolled up his sleeves, bared his arms, glared fiercely, and roared—though this was no less fine than his gentle mien and soft voice, it was less fitting when facing a ferocious beast.\n\nThe child prodigy of Anling was the fairest in the land, his eight tones blending in harmony. Had he been made to perform with the shrill, grating sounds of a blind musician or dwarf, he would have paled beside them. The pearl held in the snake’s mouth—a treasure passed down through the ages—if used to sling at crows, is no more forceful than a clod of mud. The sword of Tangxi, the sharpest in the world, if used to harvest grain, is no more effective than a sickle. In these four cases, beauty is not always prized, nor is ugliness forever discarded—each has its proper use.\n\nLong ago, a rustic rejected Zigong’s eloquence and delighted in the stableman’s plain speech. When Confucius traveled to Mount Mu, his horse strayed and ate a farmer’s grain. The farmer seized the horse and refused to return it. The Master sent Zigong to retrieve it, but the farmer ignored his ornate words. Later, the stableman was sent, and he spoke bluntly: “The grain from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea is all yours—if the horse does not eat it, what else should it eat?” The farmer, hearing this, returned the horse.\n\nKing Goujian of Yue spurned the refined music of the *lai* flute and favored the coarse songs of the countryside. It was not that Zigong was inferior to the stableman, nor that the *lai* flute was worse than rustic tunes—yet beauty is not always embraced, nor ugliness always rejected, for each thing has its use.\n\nWater, fire, metal, wood, earth, and grain—though the Six Treasuries are distinct things, each has its use. Compass, square, steelyard, balance, level, and marking-line—though the Six Measures take different forms, each has its duty.\n\nThus, when Yi Yin undertook earthworks, he assigned the long-legged to tread the rammer, the strong-backed to carry soil, the sharp-eyed to align the marking-line, and the hunchbacked to plaster the ground. Adapting tasks to abilities and matching skills to needs, each fulfilled their role and achieved success.\n\nThe merchant-singer, Xiao Qi, first served in Qi by feigning a merchant. When he met Duke Huan, he struck his ox-horn and sang:\n*\"Vast are the springs, free the fish—*\n*One who cherishes virtue yet does not serve*\n*Is fit to shelter a general.\"*\n\nThe rooster-crower, Feng Huan, was a retainer of Lord Mengchang. Lord Mengchang, a prince of Qi, had three thousand retainers in his household. The highest guests received meat, the middle guests fish, and the lowest guests vegetables. Feng Huan dwelt among the lowest for three years, yet Mengchang did not recognize him. Then he plucked his zither and sang:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!—*\n*With no fish to eat.\"*\nThe lord then granted him fish. He sang again:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!—*\n*With no carriage to ride.\"*\nThe lord then granted him a carriage.\n\nLater, when Lord Mengchang entered Qin, the Qin king imprisoned him, intending to kill him. Mengchang sent someone to beseech the Qin king’s consort for help. The consort said, \"Lord Mengchang once presented the king with a white fox-fur robe. If he gives me another, I will secure his release.\" The messenger returned and told Mengchang, who replied, \"I have only one such robe, already presented—how can I obtain another?\" At this, the retainer Feng Huan stole into the Qin palace by night, took the fox-fur robe, and delivered it to the consort. Overjoyed, she urged the king, \"Lord Mengchang is a prince of Qi. If you kill him, you will make an enemy of Qi. Better to release him.\" The king heeded her words and freed Mengchang. Fearing discovery of the theft, Mengchang fled by night back to Qi. When he reached the Qin pass, the sky was still dark, and the gate remained closed. Feng Huan imitated a rooster’s crow, and all the roosters at the pass joined in; he barked like a dog, and the pass’s dogs barked in response. The guards, hearing the crowing and barking, opened the gate. Mengchang crossed thirty *li* beyond the pass before the Qin king’s pursuing troops arrived—too late to overtake him.\n\nEach talent has its use; none should be discarded. Had Yu Zi been Mengchang’s retainer, he would have suffered the disgrace of capture and imprisonment. Had the rooster-crower served Duke Huan of Qi, he could not have aided the duke’s hegemony or assembled the feudal lords nine times. When passing a checkpoint, none is better than the rooster-crower; to exalt a hegemon, none is better than the merchant-singer. Though the merchant-singer’s elegance and the rooster-crower’s coarseness differ, in resolving crises and averting peril, their principle is one.\n\nThe market thief of Chu, a great bandit of the realm, was renowned. Yet when he grappled with a tiger, he rolled up his sleeves, flexed his arms, glared fiercely, and roared—no less fierce than the beauty of a gentle demeanor and humble tone. But in subduing a ferocious beast, nothing suited better than rolling up one’s sleeves.\n\nThe divine child of Anling was the fairest in the land. When the eight instruments played in harmony, had he used his wailing, shrill voice to cut through the music, he would have fallen short of the blind musicians and dwarves in grace.\n\nThe pearl held in the serpent’s mouth: Lord Sui of the state of Sui once saw a green snake wounded on the road. He took the snake home, treated its wounds with medicine, and fed it meat. When the wound healed, he released it. Three days later, the snake returned, bearing a luminous moon-pearl to repay Lord Sui. Thinking the snake meant to harm him, Lord Sui drew his sword to slay it—until he saw the pearl in its mouth, a gift of gratitude.\n\nThe jade disc passed down for a hundred generations—if used to shoot crows, it is no stronger than a clod of earth. The sword from Tang Brook, the sharpest in the world—if used to reap grain, it is no more effective than a sickle. These four things, though beauty is not always prized nor ugliness always discarded, each has its proper use.\n\nOnce, a rustic rejected Zigong’s eloquence and delighted in the stableman’s plain speech. When Confucius traveled to Mount Mu, his horse strayed and ate a farmer’s grain. The farmer seized the horse and refused to return it. The Master sent Zigong to retrieve it, but the farmer ignored his ornate words. Later, the stableman was sent, and he spoke bluntly: \"The grain from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea is all yours—if the horse does not eat it, what else should it eat?\" The farmer, hearing this, returned the horse.\n\nKing Goujian of Yue spurned the refined music of the *lai* flute and favored the coarse songs of the countryside. It was not that Zigong was inferior to the stableman, nor that the *lai* flute was worse than rustic tunes—yet beauty is not always embraced, nor ugliness always rejected, for each thing has its use.\n\nWater, fire, metal, wood, earth, and grain—though the Six Treasuries are distinct things, each has its use. Compass, square, steelyard, balance, level, and marking-line—though the Six Measures take different forms, each has its duty. Thus, when Yi Yin undertook earthworks, he assigned the long-legged to tread the rammer, the strong-backed to carry soil, the sharp-eyed to align the marking-line, and the hunchbacked to plaster the ground. Adapting tasks to abilities and matching skills to needs, each fulfilled their role and achieved success.\n\nThe merchant-singer, Xiao Qi, first served in Qi by feigning a merchant. When he met Duke Huan, he struck his ox-horn and sang.\n\nThe song went:\n*\"Vast are the springs, free the swimming fish—\nOne who cherishes virtue yet serves not\nMay yet shelter a general.\"*\n\nThe \"Cock-Crow Guest\" was Feng Xuan, a retainer of Lord Mengchang. Lord Mengchang, a prince of Qi, kept three thousand guests in his household. The highest-ranked received meat, the middle-ranked fish, and the lowest vegetables. Feng Xuan dwelled among the lowest for three years, yet Mengchang took no notice of him. Then Feng Xuan plucked his zither and sang:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!\nNo fish to eat!\"*\nThe lord then granted him fish. He sang again:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!\nNo carriage to ride!\"*\nThe lord then granted him a carriage.\n\nLater, when Lord Mengchang entered Qin, the Qin king imprisoned him, intending to kill him. Mengchang sent a messenger to beseech the Qin king’s consort for aid. She said, *\"Lord Mengchang once presented the king with a white fox-fur robe. If he gives me another, I will secure his release.\"* The messenger returned and told Mengchang, who replied, *\"I have only one such robe, already presented to the king—how can I obtain another?\"* Then Feng Xuan, a guest, stole into the Qin palace by night, took the fox-fur robe, and delivered it to the consort. Overjoyed, she urged the king, *\"Lord Mengchang is a prince of Qi. If you kill him, you will make an enemy of Qi. Better to release him.\"* The king heeded her and freed Mengchang.\n\nFearing discovery of the theft, Mengchang fled by night back to Qi. When he reached the Qin pass, dawn had not yet broken, and the gates remained shut. Feng Xuan imitated a cock’s crow, and all the roosters in the pass joined in; he barked like a dog, and the guard dogs barked in response. The guards, hearing the cocks crow and dogs bark, opened the gates. Mengchang crossed the pass and had traveled thirty *li* when the Qin king’s pursuing forces arrived—too late to overtake him.\n\nEach talent has its use; none should be discarded. Had Mengchang relied on Yuzi to assemble his retainers, he would have suffered the humiliation of capture and imprisonment. Had the \"Cock-Crow\" skill been entrusted to Duke Huan of Qi, it could not have aided his hegemony or his nine assemblies of the feudal lords. When passing a checkpoint, nothing serves better than a cock’s crow; to exalt a hegemon, nothing surpasses the *Shang* song. Though the *Shang* song is refined and the cock’s crow base, in resolving crises and averting peril, their principle is one.\n\nThe \"Market Thief\" of Chu was the greatest bandit in the world. When the king of Qi attacked Chu, Chu sent Zifan to lead the defense. Yet the king and his ministers, conferring together, could devise no way to repel the Qi forces. Zifan, in his youth, had admired knights-errant. The Market Thief came to him and said, *\"I hear you favor knights-errant. I am the Market Thief of the world.\"* Zifan, hearing this, did not even pause to don his cap but went out to greet him. After speaking with him, he dispatched troops to attack Qi.\n\nThe king of Chu, bewildered and fearful, saw no solution. The Market Thief secretly entered the Qi camp, stole the general’s bed-curtain, and presented it to Zifan. Zifan sent it back to the Qi forces. The next night, he entered the camp again and stole the general’s hairpin, returning it likewise. The following night, he went once more into the Qi camp and took the general’s robe, which Zifan again returned. The Qi messenger then warned the general, *\"You must leave tonight. If you do not, we will come for your head.\"* Terrified, the Qi general withdrew his army at once, and thus the Chu forces repelled the invasion. Even had Sun Wu commanded the Qi troops, they would have fought rather than flee at the first sign of retreat.\n\nShu Yu of Jin was the most sycophantic and wicked man in the state, yet he secured the return of Jisun. When the lord of Lu sent Jisun to pay court to the marquis of Jin, the marquis, believing Jisun guilty of an offense, arrested him before the assembled feudal lords. Later, upon investigation, no crime was found, and the marquis wished to release him. But Jisun, still bound, refused to leave, saying to the Jin ruler, *\"When you falsely arrested me, you declared before the lords that I was guilty. Now that I am proven innocent, you must gather the lords again to acknowledge my innocence before I will return. Otherwise, I will not go.\"* The marquis, ashamed, could find no way to send him back.\n\nJin had a great sycophant named Shu Yu, who feigned loyalty to Jisun. He said to him, *\"I am deeply troubled.\"* Jisun asked, *\"Why?\"* Shu Yu replied, *\"I hear the marquis has prepared a separate residence for you.\"* Jisun believed him and fled back to Lu by night. Thus, though Shu Yu was a great sycophant, he succeeded in returning Jisun. Even had Gan Su been sent to persuade him, he would have debated endlessly rather than cower in fear and flee.\n\nEven great thieves and sycophants, those scourges of the people and useless men—if they possess even a single skill, they may yet serve the state by fostering benefit or eliminating harm. How much more so for those of keen intelligence and refined talent? How could such men be cast aside merely because they were once great thieves?\n\nThe *Guanju* takes its inspiration from the crow and stands as the first of the *Airs*, praising its devotion and discernment. The *Luming* draws from the deer and begins the *Odes*, celebrating its finding food and calling to its kin. Though birds and beasts are base, if they possess even one virtue, the poets sing their praises—how then could a man’s virtues, once proven, be discarded?\n\nWhen the carpenter’s wedge splits the timber, the largest pieces become pillars and beams, the smaller ones rafters and crossbeams. The straight are measured by the line, the curved by the compass; each is used according to its nature, and none is discarded. Thus the noble man excels at selecting men, and so no one is cast aside; the master craftsman excels at wielding the axe, and so no material is wasted. When worthy and capable men interact harmoniously, each fulfills their role and achieves merit.\n\nAs the *Poetry* says:\n*\"Though you have silk and hemp,\ndo not discard the sedge and reeds.\nThough you have the Ji and Jiang,\ndo not discard the weary and worn.\"*\nThis is the meaning.\n\n*Civil and Martial, Twenty-Eighth*\n\nCompasses serve to model the round, yet if constrained, they deviate; squares are shaped by the carpenter’s rule, yet mirrors must reverse them. Wheels roll upon the earth, but sink in water; boats cross rivers, yet stumble on land. Why? Round and square differ in form, boats and carts in function. Though their forms differ and their uses diverge, when aptly applied, their efficacy is equal.\n\nIn scorching summer’s heat, one must seek cool winds; when ice congeals in winter’s cold, one must dwell in a warm chamber. In summer, one does not wear felt—not from hatred of it, but because heat is already excessive; in winter, one does not sleep on a rush mat—not from resentment of it, but because cold is already sufficient. One does not discard lambskin robes because spring days lengthen, nor remove woven mats because autumn dew dampens the leaves.\n\nWhen white plumes fill the field and frost-edged blades clash, civil arts yield to martial; when halberds are sheathed and rites and music flourish, martial arts yield to civil. One cannot, because the Nine Provinces are at peace, rashly abandon martial prowess, nor, when ramparts rise on every frontier, scorn the literati. Each has its season; neither can be wholly absent.\n\nThe Five Phases differ in nature, yet all serve human use; civil and martial talents differ in kind, yet both bring great benefit. Like those who fight fire—some carry basins, others pitchers, still others a single dou-measure—though their vessels vary in shape and name, in holding water to quench flames, their merit is the same. The archer leans back, the angler bends forward; though their postures differ, both gain advantage. The weaver advances step by step, the plowman retreats furrow by furrow; though their movements contrast, both complete their tasks.\n\nWhen Mozi saved Song, his feet were calloused from ceaseless travel. Mo Di, a man of Song, mastered the Nine Classics outwardly and trained ten thousand guards within. When Lu attacked Song, it sent Gongshu Ban to build cloud-ladders and assault the city. Mozi, within the walls, devised fire tools to burn the ladders. Lu exhausted its ingenuity in attacking, while Mozi’s defenses were more than sufficient. Though Gongshu Ban possessed unmatched skill, he was ultimately outmatched by Mozi. Mozi’s tireless efforts to save Song left his feet thickly calloused.\n\nGan Mu, a recluse of Wei, never left his hall. When Marquis Wen of Wei visited his home, they spoke together from dawn to dusk. The marquis’s legs grew numb, yet he dared not stretch them, saying to his attendants: “I am rich in wealth, but Gan Mu is rich in virtue. My legs dare not move.” When Qin heard that Wei had Gan Mu, it withdrew its troops and dared not attack. Though their paths differed, both preserved the state.\n\nCivil arts aid governance, martial arts subdue enemies; though their rhythms diverge, their achievements are equal. In Qin’s final years, the land crumbled like tiles and split like earth. The Han founder personally wielded a three-foot sword to plead for the people’s lives, traversing mountains and rivers, braving arrows and stones, risking a hundred deaths to secure a single life and contend for the realm. At such times, donning ceremonial caps and wide-sleeved robes was less fitting than wearing golden helmets and rhinoceros armor.\n\nAfter Xiang Yu’s defeat and the realm’s pacification, he who had founded the dynasty by force now stilled the blades with culture. He summoned scholars from Zou and Lu to establish rites and music, revived the melodies of the Six Dynasties, and assembled the myriad states in Xianyang. In that era, those who cultivated civil arts were honored, while those who practiced martial skills were briefly shamed. Within a single generation, civil and martial arts alternately rose and fell. Thus, in times of order and chaos, one must draw upon talent as the need arises.\n\nYet people of this age, if martial, disparage civil arts; if civil, mock martial skills. Each clings to their own strength and denounces the other, like those who laugh at *jue* because they favor *gong*, or reject black because they prefer white. This is neither the true nature of aptitude nor a sound judgment of reality.\n\n*Equal Employment, Twenty-Ninth*\n\nVessels have breadth and narrowness, capacities great and small, materials large and small—thus their burdens must match their appointed measure, and cannot be transgressed. A cauldron of ten thousand *shuo* cannot be filled with a ladle’s water; a bell of one *jun* cannot hold a spring’s flow. A tree of ten spans cannot be roofed with thatch; a pillar of brambles cannot support a grand hall. Why? The small is not the measure of the large, the large not the vessel of the small; the heavy is not the burden of the light, the light not the support of the heavy.\n\nTo measure the small with the large invites the fault of excess; to contain the large in the small risks overflow. To place the heavy upon the light courts breakage; to load the light with the heavy risks collapse. Thus, when the roc takes flight, its wings span the heavens, its feet tread upon clouds. Traversing the vast emptiness, it bears the azure sky upon its back—such is the power of its six pinions. *Yaoluo*, a divine steed, gallops a myriad miles in a flash of light. Its offspring, the *ji*, leaves dust in its wake, its hooves swift as the wind.\n\nYet if one were to envy the roc’s soaring speed with the wings of a sparrow, or aspire to the sun’s pace with the hooves of a sheep or dog, it is plain that such efforts cannot succeed. Thus, the bean-leaf moth cannot transform the *huozhu* worm, yet can transform the *mingling* worm. The chicken of Yue cannot hatch the eggs of a swan, yet the chicken of Lu can. Though *huozhu* and *mingling* are both insects, and the chickens of Lu and Yue both fowl, their natures differ.\n\nYet whether transformation occurs or fails, whether incubation succeeds or not—such is the matter of the *huozhu*’s greatness and the Yue chicken’s smallness. The dragon and serpent possess the nature to soar and coil, thus they ride clouds and cleave to mists; the worthy and capable possess the virtue of governance, thus they ascend to power and occupy office. Though clouds and mists be dense, the ant and earthworm cannot rise, for they lack the nature; though power and office be lofty, the mediocre and blind cannot govern, for they want the virtue. Thus, petty wisdom cannot devise grand schemes, nor can narrow virtue abide in vast domains. To plot greatness with smallness invites peril; to dwell in breadth with narrowness courts ruin.\n\nWhen Ziyou governed Wucheng, Confucius sighed over the butchering of a chicken; when Yin He was appointed magistrate of a district, Zichan offered the admonition of weaving brocade. Zipi tasked Yin He with the magistracy, but Zichan, deeming his talent meager, held forth the practice of brocade-weaving, saying: *\"If one cannot yet grasp the shuttle, how can one weave brocade?\"* To assign great tasks to small virtue is called recklessness; to assign small tasks to great virtue is called demotion. Yet of these errors, demotion is preferable to recklessness. Therefore, the noble person measures talent before granting office, weighs office before conferring rank—thus the ruler makes no empty appointments, and the minister bears no hollow duties. Hence, there is no burden of mountains to bear, nor the anxiety of broken legs.\n\n**Caution in Speech, Thirty**\nThe sun and moon are the patterns of heaven; mountains and rivers, the patterns of earth; speech, the pattern of man. If the patterns of heaven are lost, there come eclipses and omens; if the patterns of earth are lost, there come landslides and droughts; if the patterns of man are lost, there come harms to the body. Thus, the mouth is the gateway of speech, and the tongue, the bolt of that gate. When the bolt moves, the gate opens; when the gate opens, speech issues forth. If speech is good, a thousand *li* respond; if speech is evil, a thousand *li* rebel. Words once uttered by oneself cannot be restrained by others; emotions aroused nearby cannot be halted afar.\n\nTherefore, the noble person guards his bolt to seal his speech. Speech in the mouth is like holding a blade—it must not be set in motion. To wield the blade injures throat and tongue; the harm of careless words is not merely that of a blade, for what it wounds is not only throat and tongue. Thus, heaven has the *Juan She* star, and man has the inscription of sealed lips. In the temple of the Duke of Zhou, a golden figure was cast with three seals upon its mouth, and on its back was inscribed: *\"I am one who guarded his speech in ancient times.\"* This serves to warn against frivolous words—*tao* means frivolous speech—and to guard the gate of speech. *Shuo* means error.\n\nThe mouth and tongue are the officials of calamity and misfortune, the storehouse of ruin and destruction. Speech is the belonging of life and fate, the tether of form and bones. Words issue forth, and disaster enters; speech is lost, and the self perishes. Once the self is lost, it cannot be restored; once words are spoken, they cannot be retrieved. It is like archery: while the trigger is yet drawn, the shot may still be halted; but once the arrow leaves the string, though one may wish to recall it, it cannot be done.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* admonishes the pivot of the trigger; the *Book of Songs* rebukes the stain of speech. Once speech is stained, no grinding or polishing can restore it; once the trigger is loosed, can lightning be recalled? These are the utmost cautions of the sages of old, the molten lessons for later generations. The wise guard their speech and thus commit no errors; the foolish speak lightly and bring about their own ruin and destruction.\n\nOf old, Zhibo carelessly spoke of flooding with water, and Han and Wei trod upon his heels. Zhibo, with Han Xuanzi and Wei Wuzi, joined to attack Zhao Xiangzi, flooding the city of Chaoge for three years. Zhibo, with the lords of Han and Wei, ascended the heights to survey the water, and in a lapse of speech said: *\"The Hong River can flood Anyi; the Fen River can flood Pingyang.\"* The two lords heard these words—Xuanzi nudged Wuzi with his elbow, and Wuzi trod upon Xuanzi’s foot. Xuanzi said to Wuzi: *\"Zhibo intends to flood us with water. If Zhao falls, we shall be next. It is better to act first.\"* The two lords then sent word to Xiangzi: *\"Tomorrow at dawn, send forth your troops to engage Zhibo in battle. Our two armies will withdraw to either side, and thus Zhibo will be destroyed.\"* Xiangzi then struck off Zhibo’s head, lacquered it, and used it as a chamber pot. Such was the consequence of careless speech.\n\nCao Cao let slip words before heroes, and Xuande lost his dagger and chopsticks. Cao Cao, at the end of the Han, when the realm was weak and the four quarters lacked a master, saw heroes rise on all sides: Yuan Shao raised troops in Guanxi, calling himself the Lord of Guannei; Sun Quan held Wu; Liu Zhang was in Shu. Cao Cao, too, sought to seize the realm. Liu Bei, styled Xuande, shared his ambition. When he came to visit Cao Cao, Cao shared a meal with him and said: *\"The heroes of the realm are only you and I. Those like Yuan Benchu are not worth counting.\"* (Benchu was Yuan Shao’s style.) Liu Bei, hearing these words, was startled in his heart, fearing Cao Cao had discerned his designs on the realm. As he ate, he dropped his dagger and chopsticks, then fled to Xu Zhou, later returning to Jing Zhou, where he overthrew Liu Zhang and proclaimed himself King of Shu. Cao Cao became King of Wei, Sun Quan King of Wu, and the realm was divided into the Three Kingdoms. Thus, heads became chamber pots, Xu Zhou was partitioned, the two Jin lands were carved up, Shu perished in defeat, and long-standing enmities became the realm’s laughter—all from careless speech.\n\nKing Zhao of Han slept alone through the night after plotting with Lord Gong of Tangxi. King Zhao of Han, a marquis by rank, conferred with Lord Gong of Tangxi (Tangxi being a place, and \"Gong\" his title). Lord Gong of Tangxi said to the king: *\"For a ruler, words leaked to his attendants are like jade and silk placed before wine.\"* The king of Han then slept alone through the night, fearing his dream-words might be revealed to his wives and concubines. He feared his words in dreams might be overheard.\n\nKong Guang would not name the trees of the Warm Chamber, lest his words be leaked to his attendants.\n\nKong Guang, as Minister of Works for the Han, would enter the inner palace and emerge from it. His attendants once asked: *\"What trees stand in the courtyard of the Warm Chamber?\"* Kong Guang spoke of other matters but would not name the trees of the Warm Chamber, for he wished to prevent inner affairs from becoming known outside.\n\nWords are like the wind: they travel without feet, fly without wings, and cannot be taken back. Thus the sage fears when he must speak, worries when he utters words—as though treading upon water or fire, facing peril. Only when action follows ritual does movement resemble the spring breeze, and none resent its stirring. Only when speech comes at the proper time do words ring like metal or stone, and none resent their sound. Thus one’s conduct knows no missteps, and one’s mouth no errant words.\n\n**Valuing Unity and Rarity, Chapter Thirty-One**\n\nA Yue sword, sharp by nature, must rely on hammer and anvil to become a flawless hook; a Chu bow, stiff in quality, must depend on a straightening frame to form a perfect bow. The *fangqing* is a tool for crafting arrows, used to correct the bow’s curve and straighten what is bent. Thus is the *dangong* made. The *huagong* is the bow used by the Son of Heaven.\n\nThough human nature may be keen, it must rely on wise words to cultivate virtue and conduct. Thus, the hammer and anvil smooth what is uneven, the straightening frame corrects what is crooked, and wise words rectify what is unvirtuous.\n\nThe eye is short-sighted in seeing itself, so it borrows a mirror to observe its form; the hair is clumsy in arranging itself, so it must rely on a comb to set it in order; the heart is blind to its own faults, so it must depend on words to guide its actions. The face is made clear by the power of the mirror; the hair is made orderly by the work of the comb; conduct is made honorable by the benefit of wise words.\n\nA mirror and comb groom the form—this favor is light. Wise words perfect virtue—this favor is weighty. Yet people delight in a mirror’s clarity of their appearance but do not admire a scholar’s clarity of their heart; they desire a comb to arrange their hair but do not wish for wise words to order their nature. This is to discard weighty virtue and pursue light merit—is this not inverted?\n\nOne who wears robes and caps, if unable to make them with their own hands, knows to seek others to craft them. Yet when it comes to ordering their own conduct, they do not know to borrow words to refine their actions—is this not to treat the body lightly and robes heavily? Is this not absurd?\n\nThe gentleman values the favor of upright words more than gifts of carriages and jade; he delights in hearing his faults more than the fame of virtue and righteousness. Thus, King Zhuang of Chu slighted a thousand-chariot state but prized a single word from Shen Shu. When Chen Zhengshu caused chaos and killed the lord of Chen, King Zhuang of Chu led troops to Chen, killed Zhengshu, and intended to make Chen a commandery, appointing his own son to govern it. His minister Shen Shu admonished him: *\"Now that you have punished Zhengshu for Chen, you wish to make its land a commandery and have your son rule it. When the feudal lords hear of this, they will not say you punished evil for Chen but will claim you coveted its land and killed Zhengshu. Why not send envoys abroad to seek Chen’s descendants and establish one as its ruler to govern the state?\"* The king followed his advice, found a descendant, and enthroned him.\n\nFan Xian valued a boatman’s brief counsel over ten thousand *mu* of land. Fan Xian, a minister of Jin, had killed the grandee Yue You and feared revenge from Yue You’s son. While traveling, he asked a boatman: *\"Have you seen Yue You’s son?\"* The boatman replied: *\"Return to Jin and govern its laws well. Even if Yue You’s son lives, what can he do? But if you come and go without restraint and neglect the state’s governance, then everyone in this boat is no different from Yue You’s son. Why ask after him?\"* Fan Xian then granted the boatman ten thousand *mu* of land to honor his brief counsel.\n\nJi Lu embraced the Five Admonitions, and Zhao Meng treasured the Nine Sayings. The *zhen* is a remembrance, nine words in length. Its precepts are: do not revile in chaos, do not indulge in excess, do not rely on favor, do not echo blindly, do not transgress ritual, do not feign ability, do not pardon indiscriminately, do not punish without virtue, do not violate what is unjust.\n\nFrom this, can carriages and jade, fields and cities, compare in value to wise words?\n\nWhen Duke Huan of Qi ignored the advice of the Yue man, he ultimately suffered from a bone-marrow illness. The Yue man was Bian Que. When he entered Qi and saw the duke was ill, he said: *\"Your illness can be cured.\"* The duke replied: *\"Old physicians take the absence of symptoms as proof of their skill.\"* Bian Que departed. The next day, he saw the duke again and said: *\"Your illness can be treated.\"* The duke replied: *\"There is no illness to treat.\"* Later, when Bian Que came again, he fled. After Bian Que left, the duke’s condition worsened, and he sent men to find him, wishing to have his illness treated. Bian Que returned and said: *\"When I first saw you, your illness was in the skin—acupuncture could have cured it. Next, it was in the muscles and blood—herbal medicine could have cured it. Later, it reached beneath the fat and membrane—this illness cannot be treated. That is why I left.\"* The duke said: *\"This is a truly good physician.\"* He sent him off with gifts, but the duke soon died.\n\nKing Fuchai of Wu did not heed Mei Cheng’s words and ultimately suffered annihilation. Mei Cheng was a minister of the King of Wu and the father of Mei Gao. When the king of Wu rebelled, Mei Cheng admonished him, but the king ignored his words and thus brought ruin upon his state.\n\nOne who is about to fall ill no longer savors the taste of fish and meat; one whose state is about to collapse no longer accepts loyal remonstrance. Thus, the dying say there are no good physicians to blame, and the ruined say there are no forthright ministers. To not listen to wise words is deafness—not because the ears are blocked, but because wise words do not enter them.\n\nTherefore, the wise accept admonition before trouble takes shape, gather counsel at the first sign of peril, follow goodness as smoothly as a turning wheel, and shun evil as if fleeing a cliff. Upright words ring in the ears, and calamity distances itself from the body.\n\nIn ancient times, Emperor Yao set up a drum for remostrance, Shun erected a pillar for slander, Tang appointed officers to oversee faults, and King Wu established the *jieshen* hairpin. The *tao* is a small drum, shaken while suspended. With the divine insight of sages, who perceive the subtlest workings without the slightest error, they still established broad means of listening and opened paths for worthy words. How could they not have left this example for later generations to show the benefit of upright speech?\n\nIf even the former sages could gather counsel from the humblest sources, how much more should common men value words?\n\nThus, in the relationship between minister and sovereign or child and father, there are the rites of offering counsel, rejecting impropriety, and gentle remonstrance. Between friends of profound understanding, there is also the duty of mutual refinement through earnest exchange. If a noble person can heed words as echoes, follow goodness as flowing water, then their person will rest secure as Mount Tai, their virtue flourish as pines and catalpas, their reputation resound like metal and stone, and their name endure for a thousand generations.\n\n**Injury by Slander, Thirty-Second**\nPraise is the pivot for extolling goodness, while slander is the trigger for broadcasting evil. The extolling of goodness arises from an inherently noble nature; the broadcasting of evil stems from a perverse disposition. A noble disposition naturally seeks to perfect things, while a perverse one is bent on harming others. Thus, when praise is used to discuss virtue, its merit lies in exhausting all that is good; when slander exaggerates faults, its cunning lies in exhausting all that is evil. Why is this so? The common crowd delights in the extraordinary—without it, they take no interest. If praise does not amplify a person’s virtues, the listener’s heart remains unsatisfied; if slander does not magnify another’s faults, the hearer’s ears remain unfilled. Since good people are few and the wicked many, those who praise fall silent while slanderers clamor.\n\nThus, they wash clean to seek stains, blow on fur to find flaws, conjure something from nothing, turn white into black, inflate the trivial to the weighty, and stretch an inch into a foot. This is why Mozi wept over undyed silk—Mozi being Mo Di—grieving that silkworms’ threads, originally pure white, are dyed and change color, becoming blue or yellow. So too are good people, when slandered, turned to evil. This is why Yang Zhu wept at the fork in the road—Yang Zhu, a man of Song. Traveling with others, he would suddenly wail upon seeing a crossroads, lamenting how many had taken the wrong path, for once turned, blue and yellow become indistinguishable, left and right confused.\n\nIn ancient times, slander was likened to the green fly, as when Duke Wu of Wei believed calumny and was satirized in verse: *\"Buzzing green flies alight on the fence; how can a gracious lord be so credulous?\"* Slander is like the green fly that stains white to black. It is compared to a sharp blade, for it stains purity with darkness—*zi* meaning the color of ink—and a knife’s edge wounds all it touches. Thus, there are four fears one must guard against: birds with crooked necks and taloned feet are feared by their feathered kin; beasts with hooked beaks and curved claws are feared by their furred kind; fish with serrated lips and jagged teeth are feared by their scaled fellows; and people with sharp tongues and slanderous flattery are feared by all.\n\nThe slanderous and envious invariably delight in hearing of others’ faults and detest hearing of their virtues. If another’s talent and wisdom surpass their own, or if wealth and rank exceed theirs, it is as though a lump lodges in their throat, choking their desire to swallow, or a film clouds their eyes, longing to be removed. The deeper this choking resentment, the more florid their slanderous words become. Thus, those who enhance their beauty are resented by ugly women, and those who conduct themselves with integrity are envied by the slanderous and perverse.\n\nIn former times, Zhi Buyi had no elder brother, yet slanderers accused him of seducing his sister-in-law. Zhi Buyi was a man of the Former Han. At that time, slander spread the tale of his pursuing a sister-in-law. Since he had never had a brother, how could he have a sister-in-law to seduce?\n\nFifth Lun married three times, each to an orphaned girl, yet the world secretly accused him of striking his father-in-law. Fifth Lun was a man of the Later Han. He married three orphaned girls, but slanderers claimed he had once struck his father-in-law. This is to heed the hollow and demand an echo, to gaze at emptiness and seek a shadow—perverse in sentiment, inverted in reason, and utterly deceitful.\n\nThough these two men were virtuous, their conduct neither impure nor offensive to others, they could not escape the world’s slander. Is this not like beasts hating the hunter’s net or men resenting those above them? Thus, the obstruction of the good by slanderous deceit is like the bright morning sun obscured by dense fog, so that heaven cannot be seen; or like the purest sand and stone rendered invisible by muddy currents, so that earth cannot be seen. Though their nature is luminous and pure, it cannot shine forth, for mist and haze veil it. The autumn wind blights the thriving orchid and sweet flag, just as slanderers ruin the upright and wise.\n\nSlanderers know only how to harm and envy others, not how their words wound the one they flatter; they know how their words wound the one they flatter, yet do not realize they bring ruin upon themselves. Thus, the boundless slander of Wuji brought false blame upon Zichang, and both perished together. Wuji, surnamed Fei, was a man of Chu and a grandee of Jin. Zichang, surnamed You, was also a grandee of Jin, serving alongside Wuji. When the Lord of Jin wished to visit Zichang’s home, Wuji deceived Zichang, saying: “The Lord of Jin loves fine troops and horses. Tomorrow he will come to your house—you should station elite soldiers within your gates.” Zichang believed him and arrayed his troops inside the gate to await the Lord of Jin’s arrival. When the Lord of Jin indeed arrived at Zichang’s gate, Wuji said to him: “One must be aware of affairs. Let your servant enter first to scout.” Wuji went inside, then emerged to report: “Zichang has readied elite troops within his gates, intending to ambush you.” Enraged, the Lord of Jin had Zichang put to death. After Zichang’s execution, another informed him that it was Wuji’s scheme, and the Lord of Jin then executed Wuji as well. Thus it is said: Zichang was falsely blamed, and both You and Fei perished. Such is the ruin wrought by the tide of slander and flattery.\n\nAlas! Let gentlemen of later generations take heed.\n\n**Vigilance in Formation, Thirty-Third**\n\nFaults are the ladder of resentment; resentment is the storehouse of misfortune. The nature of misfortune necessarily arises from accumulated resentment; the origin of faults often lies in neglecting the small. Small faults arise beyond expectation; accumulated resentment takes shape beyond foresight. Thus, when it comes, it cannot be regretted; when it forms, it cannot be guarded against. If one fails to guard against resentment with care, calamity will soon arrive.\n\nTherefore, one who climbs a steep cliff without falling is cautious in great matters; one who stumbles over an anthill or a mound of earth—where a single inch of piled soil is called a *feng*—is careless in small ones. If one treads with vigilance, even a treacherous path may be traversed safely; if one moves with recklessness, even a level road may cause a fall. The wise recognize the harm in slight and small things, thus they are cautious of minute dangers, ever wary and reverent, as if driving a galloping horse with a rotting rope.\n\nA swan-goose’s nature is light, yet accumulation sinks a boat; fine silk is delicate, yet layering breaks an axle. That such light and subtle things as silk can capsize a boat or snap an axle is due to their accumulation. Thus, a wall collapses because of its decay; a sword breaks because of its flaws. A worm of a foot’s length can bore through a dike and flood a town; a wisp of smoke from a chimney’s crack can reduce a thousand homes to ash.\n\nThe beginning of resentment is subtler than decay or flaws, yet its harm is greater than that of a collapsing wall or a broken sword. The damage wrought by misfortune exceeds that of a town or a house—guarding against its sprouts is more urgent than preventing water or fire.\n\nThe *Book of Xia* states: *\"Resentment need not be overt; what is unseen must be heeded.\"* Thus, resentment does not lie in heaven, nor does it lie in the small. A spark, if unextinguished, can burn Mount Kunlun; a trickle, if unchecked, can become the Yangtze or the Yellow River. The birth of resentment cannot be inferred by analogy; the spread of misfortune cannot be guessed.\n\nSome resentments are great yet result in little; some grievances are slight yet lead to grave consequences. What seems profound may not be perilous, while what appears trivial must not be taken lightly. It is like the wind: a gale may tear through clouds, hurl stones, churn waters, and uproot trees, yet leave a man’s blood and pulse unharmed; but the wind from a rat’s burrow, stirring not even dust, ruffling not a hair, may yet penetrate the flesh and become a deep affliction. The great does not harm, while the small becomes a calamity—because the great wind scatters, while the small wind strikes with precision.\n\nThus, the Han founder pardoned Guan Gao’s treachery—Guan Gao, minister to the King of Zhao, who plotted to assassinate the emperor at Zhiren Pavilion.\n\nThe High Ancestor arrived at Xiangren Pavilion intending to rest, but his heart stirred uneasily. He asked his attendants the name of the pavilion. They replied, \"This is Zhiren Pavilion.\" The High Ancestor said, \"Zhiren Pavilion—it means ‘to obstruct and press upon a man.’\" Thereupon, he fled swiftly under cover of night and thus escaped Guan Gao’s harm.\n\nLater, someone informed the High Ancestor: \"Guan Gao plotted to kill you at Zhiren Pavilion.\" Guan Gao’s followers, twenty in all, all took their own lives. Guan Gao said, \"If we all die together, no one will be left to prove the King of Zhao’s innocence.\" Thereupon, one man reported this to the High Ancestor. The High Ancestor had Guan Gao thrown into prison, where the jailers flogged him over a thousand lashes. Yet Guan Gao never falsely confessed, insisting that the King of Zhao had not rebelled. The High Ancestor then questioned him personally and verified the truth. Guan Gao thus informed the High Ancestor that the King of Zhao had not rebelled, whereupon the High Ancestor released Guan Gao and also pardoned him. Guan Gao said, \"I sought to kill Your Majesty—how could I face eating another’s salary or serving as another’s minister?\" He then dug a pit and died in it.\n\nLater Wei’s ruler vented his grudge against Zhang Xiu. This \"later Wei ruler\" was Cao Cao, who contended with Yuan Shao for supremacy over the realm. Zhang Xiu was a general under Yuan Shao who clashed with Cao Cao in battle and captured Cao Cao’s beloved son, whom he then executed. After Yuan Shao’s defeat, his forces scattered, and Zhang Xiu came to surrender to Cao Cao. Xu Chu said to him, \"You should flee to Wu instead.\" Zhang Xiu replied, \"I cannot.\" Xu Chu asked, \"Why not?\" \"You killed his beloved son—how can you surrender to him?\" Zhang Xiu said, \"Lord Cao is a man of great ambition, one who can unite the realm under his rule. I killed his son—this was my private grievance. Later, he will also swallow Wu. Can a true man endure repeated humiliation?\" He then surrendered to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao captured Zhang Xiu, he pointed at his face and said, \"It is you who have made me establish great trust throughout the world.\" He appointed Zhang Xiu as a general and absolved him of his former crimes. *Xie* means \"to leak\" or \"to conceal\"—he concealed Zhang Xiu’s past offenses.\n\nHan Xin avenged the humiliation of his youth. Han Xin was a man of Huaiyin who neither pursued a livelihood nor provided for even a single meal. He liked to wear a long sword in the Huaiyin marketplace. A young man insulted him, saying, \"You wear a long sword—can you kill a man? If you can, then kill me. If you cannot, then crawl between my legs.\" Han Xin looked at the young man for a long time, then calculated that killing him would bring no benefit. He bent down and crawled between the young man’s legs. Later, the High Ancestor appointed him Grand General. Han Xin summoned the young man from the marketplace and said to him, \"You humiliated me in the past—can you humiliate me today?\" The young man begged for his life, and Han Xin pardoned his offense, appointing him to a minor post.\n\nAn Guo forgave Tian Jia’s insolence. An Guo was Han Anguo, who served as Grand Scribe of Liang. He was imprisoned for an offense, and the jailer Tian Jia insulted him. Anguo said, \"Can cold ashes still burn?\" Tian Jia replied, \"If cold ashes should flare up, I will piss on them.\" Later, Anguo was released and appointed Inspector of Liang Province. The jailer Tian Jia fled in terror. Anguo said, \"If you flee, I will exterminate your clan. If you do not flee, I will pardon your crime.\" Tian Jia then appeared before Anguo. Anguo laughed and said to him, \"The cold ashes burn today—why do you not piss on them?\" Tian Jia, ashamed of his former offense, trembled uncontrollably. Anguo then appointed him to the office of Minister of Justice, which is today’s position of Marshal.\n\nAll these men encountered wise and magnanimous rulers, whose broad-mindedness allowed deep resentments to be set aside rather than avenged.\n\nLu’s thin wine led to the siege of Dengye. During the time of the Six States, when Chu was hegemonic, the feudal lords all came to pay court to the King of Chu. The King of Zhao also came to pay court, presenting cattle and wine. The King of Zhao’s wine was fine, and the King of Chu’s officials came to request some. The King of Zhao refused, saying, \"This wine has not yet been offered to the King of Chu, so I cannot give it.\" The officials then took the wine intended for the King of Zhao, and in its place substituted the thin wine of the Marquis of Lu. They presented it to the king, saying, \"This is the King of Zhao’s thin wine.\" The King of Chu drank it and grew furious: \"To arrive late is to slight me once; to offer thin wine is to slight me twice.\" When the assembly of feudal lords dispersed, he raised an army and besieged Dengye, which was the King of Zhao’s city.\n\nThe uneven distribution of mutton stew led to the defeat of Song’s army. The state of Song sent Hua Yuan to lead troops against Zheng. The next day, they were to join battle, so Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to make stew for a feast with his officers. His charioteer, Yang Zhen, did not receive any stew. The next day, when they fought Zheng, Yang Zhen said to Hua Yuan, \"Yesterday, you decided the stew; today, I decide the battle.\" He then drove Hua Yuan’s chariot into the Zheng army, and the Song forces suffered a great defeat. Hua Yuan was captured by Zheng. The people of Song ransomed him with gold, silver, and precious treasures. They said to Yang Zhen, \"When the chariot charged into Zheng the other day, it was because the horses bolted and you could not restrain them.\" They spoke thus to avoid punishing Yang Zhen.\n\nQiu Sun lost his life over a state-owned rooster. Hou Zhaobo and Ji Pingzi held a cockfight. Pingzi had golden spurs made for his rooster, while Zhaobo sprinkled mustard-seed powder on his rooster’s wings. When the powder flew into Pingzi’s rooster’s eyes, it retreated. Later, Pingzi learned of this and reproached Qiu Sun, saying, \"Why did you sprinkle mustard-seed powder on your rooster’s wings, causing it to get into my rooster’s eyes?\" Zhaobo replied, \"Why did you put golden spurs on your rooster?\" Each grew furious, and they raised armies to fight for several days. Pingzi then killed Zhaobo.\n\nThe Marquis of Qi lost his state over a laughing concubine. The state of Jin sent the grandee You Ke as an envoy to Qi.\n\nYou Ke’s foot was lame. The Marquis of Qi wished to mock him, so he set up a curtain in the corridor and had his concubines watch from behind it. As You Ke limped up to the hall, the concubines all burst into laughter at once. Enraged by their mockery, You Ke returned to Jin and led an army to attack Qi, ultimately destroying the state of Qi.\n\nThese were all trivial matters that brought ruin to states and death to men—light scorn and petty grudges that sowed the seeds of disaster. Over food, drink, jest, and laughter, they lost their nations and their lives, becoming laughingstocks for all under Heaven, perishing through their own carelessness.\n\nBetween generations, people often bring great calamity upon themselves through small, seemingly insignificant matters. Disaster arises from human actions, just as good fortune is shaped by human deeds. Misfortune and blessing share the same door; harm and benefit dwell as neighbors. Without the utmost discernment, none can distinguish between them.\n\nThus, wisdom and foresight are the gateways to fortune and misfortune; movement and stillness are the pivots of benefit and harm. One cannot afford to be careless.\n\n**Admonition Against Fullness, Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe seasons reach their peak and then fade; the Five Phases fulfill their functions and then retreat. Thus, when yang reaches its extreme, yin descends; when yin reaches its extreme, yang rises. The sun at its zenith begins to decline; the moon at its fullness begins to wane—this is the constant Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sun at noon inclines westward; the moon at fullness wanes; men who boast and overreach perish; vessels that are full spill over. Hence, this chapter is aptly named *Admonition Against Fullness*.\n\nPower accumulates and then diminishes; wealth gathers and then scatters; youthful vigor turns to decline; joy at its peak reverts to sorrow—such is the unchanging pattern.\n\nOf old, Confucius observed a singing vessel and changed his expression. In the temple of the Duke of Zhou stood a sacrificial vessel that was always tilted and unstable, called the *Respectful Vessel*. When too full, it would tip; when not full, it would still lean; only when level would it stand upright. Confucius, seeing it in the temple of the Duke of Zhou, asked the keeper of the vessel, \"What is this vessel called?\" The keeper replied, \"The Respectful Vessel.\" Confucius said, \"I have heard that the Respectful Vessel tips when too full, leans when not full, and stands upright only when level.\" Thereupon, he sighed and adjusted his demeanor, saying, \"The ancients crafted this to admonish later generations, teaching them to be wary of fullness and excess, that each may remain within their proper measure.\"\n\nHe observed gain and loss and sighed; he examined images and recognized patterns; he saw frost and knew ice would follow.\n\nThose who know how to advance but not retreat tread the perilous path of overflowing fullness. Those who dwell in existence without courting danger walk the secure ground of Mount Tai. Thus, thunder in the heavens is called *Great Strength*; a mountain within the earth is called *Modesty*. Modesty gathers the many to reduce the few; strength refrains from treading where ritual does not permit.\n\nTo abide in strength yet employ ritual, to dwell in modesty yet gain benefit, to descend from heights to approach the lowly, to restrain the strong to align with the weak—none who embrace reduction fail to shine, and none who are arrogant and full avoid destruction.\n\nThe sage knows the difficulty of relying on fullness and prosperity, so he always dwells in virtue with humility and emptiness. Though wise and discerning, his aspirations grow ever lower; though wealthy and exalted, his heart grows ever more yielding; though his merits cover all under Heaven, his spirit remains ever vigilant. He does not pride himself on his abundant virtue nor lord his lofty position over the people.\n\nThus, King Zhuang of Chu, though his achievements were established, remained fearful in heart; Duke Wen of Jin, though victorious in battle, wore a troubled countenance. They did not hate glory or despise victory but understood that great merit demands a small heart, and dwelling in safety requires mindfulness of danger.\n\nYu of Xia, though wearing but a single hempen sash, rose seven times to receive guests; the Duke of Zhou, though washing his hair but once, grasped it three times to greet visitors. He ate without time to be full, bathed without time to dry his hair—not because he endured hunger or delighted in toil, but because he was eager to receive scholars and abided in humble radiance.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says, \"The noble one, though exalted, lowers himself to the humble, and thus greatly wins the people.\" Therefore, the noble person, though high, can be lowly; though rich, can be frugal; though noble, can be base; though wise, can be foolish; though brave, can be timid; though eloquent, can be reticent; though learned, can be shallow; though perceptive, can be dull—this is called \"reducing yet never exhausted.\"\n\n**Illuminating Modesty, Chapter Thirty-Five**\nThe Way of Heaven descends and shines with light; rivers and lakes flow downward and become kings. Thus, a mountain within the earth forms modesty, and kings and lords take \"orphaned\" and \"widowed\" as their titles of reduction.\n\nModesty brings honor and ever-greater height; reduction brings distinction and ever-greater nobility. Height must take the low as its foundation; nobility must take the base as its root. Forgetting one’s nobility while in a noble position enables one to lower oneself to the people; forgetting one’s height while in a high position enables one to descend to the lowly.\n\nThus, when *Great Strength* advances, it reverts to the modesty of Heaven and Earth; when ascent reaches its extreme, it descends to the modesty of yin and yang; when fullness ends, it wanes to the modesty of the sun and moon; when the Dao is full, the sage embodies emptiness.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states that modesty is honored and shines ever brighter; the *Laozi* says that one does not boast. Thus, the modest person, though accomplished, lowers himself; though high, follows the lowly; though sagely, follows the vulgar.\n\nNot boasting lies in having merit; not priding oneself lies in having virtue; not speaking of one’s goodness belongs to the stream of emptiness, retreat, and humble embrace.\n\nTo delight in fullness and consider oneself worthy, to boast of merit and flaunt goodness—these are the common tendencies of the world, but the sage detests them.\n\nIf one must boast of merit, even if rewarded and praised for one’s labor, the heart remains unsatisfied. If one flaunts one’s goodness, even if granted great rewards, one will resent their insufficiency. Thus, resentment and expectation arise, the demeanor of restlessness and competition appears, the path of boasting and flaunting opens, and the seeds of calamity and disaster are sown.\n\nThe noble person is not thus. In glory, he takes embracing reduction as his foundation; with merit, he does not boast; with goodness, he does not flaunt. He forgets his merit, yet his merit endures; he forgets his goodness, yet his goodness remains whole.\n\nWhen the heart constantly forgets goodness, one can use goodness to gauge others; when the heart constantly dwells on goodness, one desires to use goodness to surpass others.\n\nThus, if the heart dwells on merit and goodness, it is not truly modest; if the mouth feigns modesty, is it not hypocritical? To use goodness to surpass others while forgetting merit and goodness is not boasting or flaunting; to speak of one’s goodness is not necessarily insincere.\n\nTherefore, if the heart dwells on merit and goodness, it is not truly modest. Though the mouth may not speak, it does not escape boasting and flaunting. If the heart lets go of merit and goodness, though the mouth may speak of them, it does no harm to integrity.\n\nThus, Yu of Xia openly proclaimed and praised his merits, while Gao Yao, in expounding his plans, said, \"Tell me of my kindness.\"\n\nHow could it be that they boasted of merit while preserving kindness? Those who speak of goodness not to flaunt it yet flaunt their goodness invariably praise their own abilities; those who speak of kindness not to boast of it yet boast of their kindness invariably cling to their kindness. The sages, knowing that human nature exalts worthiness and delights in self-promotion, thus tempered their words with restraint and often deferred in humility, thereby casting aside arrogance and vainglory to set an example for the world.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Great Essence**\n\nFire’s nature is such that in the bitter cold, when frost chills the air, ice splits the earth, yet its blazing qi does not wane; in scorching heat, when walls glow red and metals melt, yet its blazing qi does not intensify. Why is this? It possesses its natural essence, and the cold cannot alter it. Thus, cinnabar may be ground but cannot be stripped of its color; orchids may be trampled but cannot be robbed of their fragrance; jade may be shattered but cannot be changed in its whiteness; gold may be melted but cannot be softened in its hardness. Each embraces its natural nature, which cannot be forcibly transformed.\n\nScholars, too, possess the nature of loyalty and righteousness, holding fast to integrity and unyielding resolve—an unchanging essence like these. Thus, if in life they turn from the Dao, they do not consider it gain; if in death they align with righteousness, they do not deem it harm. Therefore, they do not chase profit to flee harm, nor do they heed life and regret death. They cannot be swayed by threats to alter their principles, nor can they be enticed by gain to change their hearts.\n\nIn the past, when Zixi was threatened, blades were leveled at him, yet his heart did not waver. When the rebel Bai Gongsheng of Chu killed Zixi and seized Zixi, he said, \"Those who side with me will be spared; those who oppose me will be killed.\" He brandished a blade to stab Zixi, yet Zixi still refused to comply. Thus it is said: they do not flee harm by chasing profit.\n\nWhen Yan Ying was forced to swear allegiance, a hooked halberd was pressed against his neck, yet his will did not falter. After Cui Zhu killed the Lord of Qi, he had men use an iron hook to drag Yan Ying by the neck, demanding he swear an oath. Yet Yan Ying ultimately refused to join Cui Zhu’s rebellion. He could not be swayed by profit or harm.\n\nScholars of loyalty and righteousness, who uphold the standards of conduct, may appear no different from others in their actions. Yet when they face peril and tread danger, their resolve and fortitude reveal their distinction. It is like the jade of Mount Zhong—Mount Zhong being in Kuaiji—and the pines of cold peaks: compared to common mulberry, catalpa, or willow, they seem no different. Yet when placed in fire, jade-like stones melt, while true jade, though burned in a furnace for three days, does not change color; though submerged in deep waters for a year, its branches and leaves do not wither. Only then is its difference from other jades and trees known.\n\nThus, courage is roused only when one strips bare and grapples with a tiger; swiftness is revealed only when one leaps over perilous chasms; strength is proven only when one lifts ten thousand *jun*; and steadfast courage emerges only when one endures hardship and faces peril. One need not wield the *Ganjiang* sword to know its sharpness, nor draw the *Wuhao* bow to know its power. (The *Wuhao* was a bow made from the wood of the angle mulberry. Before the Yellow Emperor’s palace stood a mulberry tree with long branches where crows perched. When the crows took flight, the branches would rebound and strike them, causing them to cry out—hence the name *Wuhao*. The Yellow Emperor, seeing this, said, \"This wood must be fit for use.\" He took it to make a bow, which proved exceptionally fine, thus called the *Wuhao* bow. The *Shuowen* states: On Mount Dinghu, the Yellow Emperor received a divine bow left by an immortal; when his ministers saw it, they wailed in unison, hence the name *Wuhao* bow. Another account says that on Mount Nanling grew a *tuo* tree where crows cried daily, and thus the bow made from it was called *Wuhao*.)\n\nThe qualities of strength and sharpness are readily apparent, yet they become known only through human use. Loyalty and righteousness, however, are difficult to perceive until death—how could they not be revealed only through deeds?\n\n*End of Scroll Seven of the Liuzi*\n\n*(Textual notes: \"知\" was originally \"之,\" amended per the Wenyuan Ge edition. \"五\" was originally \"云,\" amended per the Wenyuan Ge edition. The Wenyuan Ge edition reads: \"If one treads carefully, though walking on thin ice, one may proceed in safety.\" End of Scroll Eight of the Liuzi.)*\n\nThe Annotations of Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou Prefecture: \"On Discerning Generosity\" (Chapter Thirty-Seven)\n\nMountains and hills do not plant forests for crows, yet when the forests flourish, crows naturally roost there. Rivers and lakes do not carve deep pools for fish, yet when the pools run deep, fish naturally return to them. In life, one does not accumulate wealth for others, yet when wealth is amassed, others naturally depend on it—this is not by summoning, but by the force of circumstance.\n\nA youth bearing jade may not necessarily be kind, yet people vie to befriend him, for he possesses the means to benefit others. A scholar clad in coarse cloth may by nature scorn wealth, yet all keep their distance from him, for he lacks the means to benefit others. Now, the rich who are frugal are still treated with intimacy and respect, while the poor who practice benevolence are inevitably met with neglect and disdain—not because their conduct is flawed, but because their circumstances alter how they are perceived.\n\nDriving a team of four up a mountain, one cannot proceed with reins held straight; sailing a boat into the sea, one cannot sit at ease. Why? The mountain path winds, the sea’s waters surge with waves: the traveler wishes to go straight, but the path curves; the sitter wishes to be at rest, but the water sways. The benevolent wish to give, but poverty restrains them. When wealthy, bestowing aid is not difficult; when poor and miserly, the conduct is not blameworthy.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes excess; the nature of man pities insufficiency. Beneath Mount Kun, jade is cast to crows; along the shores of Lake Pengli, fish are fed to dogs—yet no one begrudges this, not because they scorn wealth by nature, but because abundance permits it. Carrying a jar to beg for water, clutching straw to seek fire, or gathering grass resembling *longxu* to weave into mats—people use such things to fuel their stoves. Yet no one marvels at this, not because they delight in generosity by nature, but because surplus allows it.\n\nThe mouth is not a gourd that need not eat; the body is not wood or stone that need not be clothed. If food does not fill the belly, how can one cease eating to benefit others? If clothing does not cover the body, how can one bare oneself to give to others? This is not frugality by nature, but insufficiency at work.\n\nIn famine-stricken springs, one does not relieve even kin; in years of abundant harvest, one feasts neighbors far and wide. Failing to aid kin is deemed wicked; bestowing upon neighbors is deemed virtuous. Yet good and evil conduct arise from nature but are shaped by hunger and plenty.\n\nFrom this, we see: when too abundant, kindness and affection arise; when destitute, benevolence and generosity wither. Poverty is the culprit.\n\nThose who judge horses err when they seek a thousand-mile stride in a gaunt steed—this is deficiency. Those who judge men err when they expect generosity from the poor—this is lack. Men who scorn wealth are not rare in the world, yet they go unseen, for poverty obscures them.\n\nTo claim ability before one’s virtue is manifest is like a cripple selling ointment for calluses—hoping others will believe is truly difficult.\n\n\"On Harmonizing Nature\" (Chapter Thirty-Eight)\n\nWhen Ou Ye forged swords...\n\nThe swordsmith of King Goujian of Yue, surnamed Zhao and named Ganjiang, was skilled in the art of Ou Ye’s sword-casting. If a blade is too hard, it snaps; if too soft, it bends. To prevent snapping, tin must be added; to prevent bending, metal must be added. Why? Metal is hard by nature, while tin is soft; when hardness and softness are balanced, the blade is excellent. A master craftsman applies lacquer: if too slow, it fails to dry; if too hasty, it does not adhere. Only when the pace is even and harmonized does it become perfect.\n\nHuman nature is much the same. Those who are too hard harm by severity; those who are too soft falter in weakness. Those who are too slow regret missing opportunities; those who are too hasty fail through impatience. Thus, the swordsmith ensures the metal does not snap and the tin does not bend; the artisan ensures slowness does not hinder drying and haste does not weaken adhesion; the cultivator of nature ensures hardness does not become harshness, softness does not become cowardice, slowness does not miss opportunities, and haste does not lead to recklessness. Only then can both blade and vessel excel, and one’s nature and qi achieve pure harmony.\n\nIn ancient times, King Yan of Xu perished because his softness led to the ruin of his state. King Yan of Xu, a prince of that land, was fond of practicing benevolence and virtue, diligently cultivating civil power, but neglected military preparedness. Later, he was conquered by a neighboring state. At the moment of his death, he said, “I only knew how to practice civil virtue and did not realize others could be deceitful.” Duke Shang of Qi died because his cowardice brought about his own demise—this was the fault of excessive softness. Yang Chufu of Jin was undone by his sheer hardness. Yang Chufu, a grandee of Jin surnamed Yang, was of an extremely hard nature and was later killed by the ruler of Jin. Ziyang of Zheng met his end through excessive severity. The lord of Zheng was of an extremely severe and harsh nature and was slain by his ministers—this was the fault of excessive hardness. Zixi of Chu invited defeat through his overindulgence. The Prime Minister of Chu was of a lenient nature and was killed by the King of Chu. Duke Zhuang of Yan brought disaster upon himself through his impatience—this was the calamity of a hasty and narrow disposition.\n\nXimen Bao, quick-tempered, wore soft leather to temper his haste. Ximen Bao, a magistrate of Ye during the Warring States period, was of a hasty nature and wore soft leather to restrain himself. The leather was too pliant, so he wore it to moderate his disposition. Dong Anyu, slow by nature, girded himself with a silk rope to quicken his pace. Dong Anyu, governor of Jinyang, was of a slow nature. Each used one thing to remedy their shortcomings.\n\nThus, when yin and yang are harmonized, heaven and earth are in accord; when hardness and softness are balanced, human nature is in harmony. If yin and yang are not in harmony, floods and droughts lose their proper season; if hardness and softness are not balanced, strength and weakness disrupt governance. When floods and droughts lose their season, the year is ruined; when strength and weakness disrupt governance, the self is destroyed. Therefore, the wise are tolerant yet vigilant, stern yet warm, gentle yet resolute, fierce yet benevolent, hard yet tempered by softness. They restrain their strength with softness, blend strength and weakness, and balance slowness and haste. Through this cultivation of nature, no regret or misfortune arises from external things.\n\n\"On Divergent Preferences\" (Chapter Thirty-Nine)\n\nLofty pavilions and cavernous chambers, pearl curtains and jade halls—these delight men, yet birds entering them grow anxious. Towering crags and jagged cliffs, tangled vines and knotted roots—these suit the warmth-loving Di, yet men climbing them tremble. The Five Discourses and Six Classics, the *Xianchi* and *Xiaoshao* melodies—these bring joy to men, yet beasts hearing them shudder. Cascading rapids and emerald pools, surging waves and swirling eddies—these comfort fish and dragons, yet men entering them fear. Flying squirrels relish roasted meat; running beasts delight in iron; hong chickens crave snakes; men favor grain-fed livestock. Birds and beasts differ from men in nature and form, their habitats and preferences distinct—this is no cause for wonder.\n\nMen and beasts alike receive the qi of the Two Modes and embrace the Five Constants. Though the wise and foolish differ in disposition, the good and evil in conduct, when it comes to seeing the sun and moon, hearing thunder, feeling heat near fire, or knowing cold upon ice, even the dullest perception should not differ. Sounds, colors, fragrances, and flavors each have their true nature; the distinction between good and evil is self-evident. One cannot take black for white, feathers for horns, bitterness for sweetness, or foulness for fragrance. Yet when preferences diverge so starkly, they become their opposites. Such things cannot be inferred by analogy or guessed at; to invert beauty and ugliness is truly strange.\n\nA lowered gaze upon jade’s veins, a sidelong glance at a clever smile—these please the eyes of the multitude. Yet the Yellow Emperor loved the hideous features of his mother, Mo, and did not exchange them for the beauty of fallen blossoms. The Marquis of Chen delighted in the grotesque appearance of Dunqia and would not trade it for the graceful bearing of Yangwen. Roasted lamb and seared swan, minced turtle and bear’s paw steeped in honey—these tempt the mouths of the crowd. Yet King Wen preferred the shoots of water bamboo to the taste of bear’s liver. *Yangchun* and *Bai Xue*, *Ao Chu* and *Cai Ling*—these melodies please the ears of the multitude. Yet Emperor Shun of Han listened to the cries of mountain crows and found them superior to the sounds of strings and bamboo; Marquis Wen of Wei favored the clatter of hammers and chisels over the harmony of bells and stones. The fragrance of *yujin* and *xuanchang*...\n\nSpring orchids and autumn cypripedium—all are fragrant herbs, pleasing to every nose. Yet the *Hairen* delights in the stench of corpses and scorns the sweetest perfumes. The *Hairen*, dwelling by the sea, revels in the foul reek of decay. Once, a man came to the shore, anointing himself with the stench of death. The *Hairen*, catching the scent, chased after him, declaring the odor still insufficient. Such men are bound by their nature’s bias: clinging to their preferences in defiance of the multitude, they invert white to black, transmute bitterness to sweetness, shift horns to feathers, and mistake stench for incense. Beauty and ugliness have no fixed form; love and hatred no true boundary.\n\n**Chapter Forty: On Military Defense**\nIn the pristine simplicity of high antiquity, the people’s hearts knew no desire. As the age grew thin and the times decadent, strife arose and warfare was born. Shennong strung wood into bows and carved wood into arrows. The power of bow and arrow awed the world. Later, Chiyou grew fierce and violent, delighting in aggression and battle. He smelted metal into blades and sliced leather into armor, and thus warfare flourished. The Yellow Emperor fought at Zhuolu; Zhuanxu contended at Buzhou (a mountain in the Western Sea). Gonggong clashed with Zhuanxu at Buzhou Mountain. Gonggong was routed, ramming his head into the mountain, which collapsed, the pillar of heaven snapped, and the four cords of the earth were severed. Thus the northwest slanted, and the sun now sets in the west. Gonggong stomped the east with his foot, severing the earth’s veins. Hence water flows eastward. The common saying goes: “Heaven tilts in the northwest, earth is sundered in the southeast.”\n\nYao battled at Danshui, Shun campaigned against the Youmiao, Xia punished the Youhu, Yin attacked Gebo, and Zhou struck Chonghou. Warfare is a baleful instrument, a devourer of wealth and a scourge upon the people. The Five Emperors and Three Kings could not eliminate it, for its purpose is to suppress violence and quell disorder—not to squander resources and harm the people. Yet when multitudes gather, wealth scatters; when blades clash, the people suffer. Such is the nature of things.\n\nThus, in warfare, the highest art is to vanquish through strategy rather than to prize the clash of blades. To fight a hundred battles and win a hundred victories is not the acme of skill. The true master of warfare prevails without fighting—this is the pinnacle of excellence. The kingly army cultivates the upright Dao to subdue others; the hegemonic army employs cunning and deception to secure victory.\n\nThe general is the guardian of the state’s safety and the people’s lives—he must not be taken lightly. Thus, he is invested in the ancestral temple and entrusted with the axe of authority. Once he receives his mandate, he dons mourning robes and exits through the ominous gate. From that moment, when he faces the army, he forgets his kin; when he seizes the drumstick, he forgets himself. Only then can he be unbound by heaven above or earth below, fear no enemy before him, and turn his back on none behind. He weighs the nation’s fate as his foremost concern and prizes wisdom and strategy above all.\n\nThus, the general must master the seasons, discern terrain, and refine human strategy. To master the seasons is to scrutinize the movements of the seven luminaries, fathom the tendencies of the five phases, heed the stirrings of the eight winds, and observe the portents of the five clouds. To discern terrain is to recognize the configurations of the seven encampments and array the nine strategic positions. In mountainous battles, do not advance uphill; in marshy engagements, do not ford deep waters; on level ground, avoid treacherous hollows.\n\nTo refine human strategy is to embody the five virtues and grasp the two handles. The five virtues are wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness. The two handles are reward and punishment. Wisdom enables planning; trustworthiness enforces discipline; benevolence fosters love for the people; courage overawes the enemy; strictness commands the multitude. Rewards encourage merit; punishments correct transgressions. Thus, wisdom is the wellspring of adaptability and the repository of ingenuity.\n\nWarfare proceeds by devious means to secure victory. Hence, ten thousand crossbows poised on high—Sun Bin’s stratagem. When Wei dispatched Pang Juan to attack Zhao, Zhao sought aid from Qi. Qi sent Sun Bin to relieve them. Upon arrival, Sun Bin faced Pang Juan in battle. Outnumbered, he feigned retreat to weaken his forces. Pang Juan declared, “I knew the Qi troops were cowards—they retreat without fighting!” He pursued them relentlessly. Sun Bin then set an ambush at the perilous defile of Maling, stationing ten thousand crossbows, all drawn and ready. When the moment came, the arrows flew as one. That day, Pang Juan was utterly routed and slain.\n\nA thousand oxen charging as one—Tian Dan’s ruse. The Qi general was a master of defense. When Yan invaded Qi, seventy cities fell to the Yan forces. Tian Dan held out in Jimo, besieged by Yan but refusing to surrender. The Yan general warned him, “Surrender at once, or I will raze the city and slaughter all within.” Tian Dan replied, “Allow me until tomorrow.” The Yan general granted him the night. Tian Dan then dug tunnels beneath the city, readying a thousand water buffalo. He bound blades and halberds to their horns, painted their bodies with dragon patterns in five colors, and drenched their tails in oil-soaked torches. As the attack neared, he set the torches alight. The buffalo, tails aflame, stampeded through the tunnels into the Yan ranks, sowing chaos. The Yan forces scattered in panic, cut down as they fled. Tian Dan’s troops pursued, striking from behind, and the Yan army was annihilated.\n\nDamming the river with sacks of earth—Han Xin’s gambit. When the Han general led his forces to attack Zhao, Chu came to Zhao’s aid. Han Xin ordered his troops to carry two sacks of earth each, using them to dam the river and cut off the current. He then crossed the water to engage Chu. Feigning defeat, he retreated, luring the Chu forces after him. When half had crossed, Han Xin’s men breached the dam. The Chu troops, trapped midstream, were crushed. The Chu army suffered a crushing defeat.\n\nDragging brush to raise dust—Le Yi’s deception. Le Yi, a general of Jin with few troops, had his soldiers drag brushwood to kick up dust. The enemy, seeing the clouds of dust, assumed a vast army approached and fled in disarray.\n\nReleasing carts like charging boars—Yin Zi’s defense. The general loaded pigs onto carts and drove them toward the enemy camp.\n\nCloud ladders wreathed in smoke—Lu Ban’s ingenuity. When Lu attacked the Song city, he had Lu Ban construct cloud ladders.\n\nCunning arises from the unexpected; the few can thwart the many, the weak can break the strong—how much more so when the numerous strike the few, the enlightened attack the benighted.\n\nThe form of warfare resembles water: water flows, avoiding heights to seek low ground; the momentum of war avoids the solid to strike the hollow, shuns strength to attack weakness, evades order to seize chaos, and dodges sharpness to strike decline. Thus, water adapts to terrain to take shape, while troops adapt to the enemy to secure victory—so warfare has no fixed momentum, just as water has no constant form.\n\nObserve the enemy’s form to deploy cunning, follow the shifting tide to respond with change, invert the conventional to achieve ingenuity, and operate without form to attain subtlety. For wind, being tangible, can be blocked by curtains; cold and heat, being formless, cannot be barred by bolts or locks. Therefore, the master of attack leaves the enemy unsure of where to defend, as if dreading thunder and lightning, striking where least expected. The master of defense leaves the enemy unsure of where to attack, as if searching an empty expanse, finding no edge.\n\nGauge my stratagems, and fear not the enemy’s strength; gauge my strength, and fear not the enemy’s schemes. From this, it is clear: one cannot afford to be ignorant.\n\nThe general must take strategy as the foundation and benevolence as the source. Strategy is for controlling the enemy; benevolence is for winning the people. Thus, those who strategize to control the enemy are generals, while those whose strength overcomes the enemy are mere soldiers. Generals must prioritize adaptability, while soldiers must prioritize unified strength.\n\nThe stars fill the sky yet cannot outshine the crescent moon—because their forms differ and their light varies. The tiger, though mighty, is subdued by man—because its heart is not unified and its strength is not aligned. A host of ten thousand with divided hearts is no match for a hundred with a single will; a thousand taking turns in battle are no match for ten striking as one.\n\nTo seek a united host and resolute warriors, benevolence is key—grace and rewards must be clear, and punishments just. Even the lowliest (胥靡: \"mutual\" and \"nothingness\") stand firm in peril without fear, tread on ice without trembling, for they face punishment without fearing for their lives.\n\nNow, soldiers rush into blades without flinching from death, plunge into fire and water as if returning home—not because they scorn life or crave injury, but because benevolence and grace drive them. When a general wins the hearts of his troops, he must share their hardships: in heat, he does not raise a canopy; in cold, he does not don fur—thus equalizing their exposure to the elements. On narrow paths, he does not ride; on hills, he dismounts—thus equalizing their toil. He eats only after the army’s food is cooked, drinks only after the army’s wells are dug—thus sharing their hunger and thirst. In battle, he stands amid arrows and stones—thus sharing their peril.\n\nWhen pure wine is poured into a stream, the entire army downstream becomes drunk. King Goujian of Yue once received a gift of wine in his camp. He said, \"This wine is not enough to share with all.\" So he poured it into the river, and as it flowed downstream, his soldiers drank from it, tasting the wine in the water and becoming sated with intoxication.\n\nA single warm word can warm the entire army like bundled silk. When King Zhuang of Chu led his troops in a snowstorm, his men froze. With kind words, he consoled them, and upon hearing his voice, they felt as if wrapped in warm cotton. If a general wins the hearts of his men, they will vie to rush into death. With such an army, fighting is like rolling stones down a mountain or torrents rushing into a ravine—who can withstand them?\n\n**Section Forty-One: Military Review**\nThe *Methods of Sima* states: The *Methods of Sima Rangju* are the laws of warfare. Though a state be vast, if it delights in war, it will perish; though the world be at peace, if it forgets war, it will be imperiled. Frequent warfare exhausts the people; lack of practice makes them idle. Exhaustion is not a means of preservation, nor is idleness a way to prepare for invaders.\n\nThus, troops should not be deployed recklessly, and martial training should not be neglected—this preserves the people’s lives and maintains military readiness. Confucius said, \"To not train the people in war is to abandon them.\" The *Book of Changes* says, \"The noble person refines weapons to prepare for the unforeseen.\"\n\nTherefore, in spring they *sou*, in summer they *miao*, in autumn they *mi*, and in winter they *shou*—all conducted during agricultural lulls to practice martial affairs. Every three years, they train, and the troops become skilled in warfare. The *sou* marks the beginning of military affairs; the *zhenlv* refers to the return and reorganization of the army. Upon returning, they feast and report to the ancestral temple, displaying their ranks, clarifying hierarchy, ordering seniority, distinguishing ranks, and practicing etiquette.\n\nWhen the three armies are vast and scattered, standards are raised. If voices cannot be heard, drums and bells are used to convey commands; if sights cannot be seen, banners and flags are employed to guide the eyes. If the people are untrained in war, they will not hear the drums or recognize the signals, advancing or retreating without coordination, their formations disordered. Thus, soldiers tremble before battle, horses sweat before the charge—not because the men are cowardly or the horses weak, but because of lack of training.\n\nKing Helü of Wu had palace women trained in battle formations, drilling them in laws and commands, their movements and retreats perfectly aligned with the rules. Though they tread through fire and water without flinching, it was not their nature to be brave or their temperaments to be fierce—it was the result of training.\n\nA blunt blade may seem dull in the hands of the unskilled but sharp in the hands of the adept; yet skill brings victory, while clumsiness leads to defeat—it is all a matter of practice or its absence.\n\nHelü tested his people at the Five Lakes (the waters of Yue, where the Hu and Yue peoples excelled in naval warfare). Swords pressed to shoulders drew unceasing blood. Goujian drilled his troops in their quarters, and they vied to enter fire and water. Over a thousand died before the gong sounded the retreat—not because they hated life or craved death, but because rewards and punishments were clear, and training was thorough.\n\nPenglai was skilled in archery, yet could not employ a bow that was not properly tuned. (Penglai studied archery under Yi and mastered all of Yi’s techniques—hence the claim that he was skilled in archery.) Zaofu was skilled in charioteering, yet could not spur a horse that had not been broken. (Zaofu was the seven-times great-grandfather of Viscount Jian of Zhao, a man of King Mu of Zhou’s time who drove the royal chariot up Mount Kunlun.) Ban Chui, the master craftsman of Shennong’s age, was skilled in cutting, yet could not wield an axe that was not sharp. Sun Wu was skilled in command, yet could not fight with troops that had not been trained.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor taught bears and grisly beasts to battle, or when the Luo clan taught eagles, hawks, and crows to strike, even creatures of brute nature could follow human instruction and engage in combat—all through the power of training. How, then, could the people of a state not be drilled in martial arts?\n\nThus, through constant practice in archery and charioteering, one becomes so proficient in the hunt that capture and seizure come naturally—all the result of training. Without prior practice, one fears only stumbling and fleeing; how can one hope for success? When trained troops clash with untrained ones, it is like the Hu and Yue peoples competing in swimming—there is no contest.\n\nFor this reason, the early kings, taking advantage of periods of leisure, conducted grand reviews to select the multitude, repair and prepare weapons, and make ready the state’s defenses. (Here, *shan* means to prepare for war.) This was the foresight of governance.\n\n**Chapter 42: Adaptive Power**\n\nTo follow principle and maintain constancy is the Dao; to respond to danger and control change is *quan* (adaptive power). The term *quan* is like a steelyard: the beam measures deviation from the upright, while the sliding weight assesses the balance of forces. When weights are unequal, the beam reveals it. If a link is added to the left side, the right tilts; if added to the right, the left tilts. Only when nothing is added does equilibrium prevail.\n\nIn human affairs, one must respond to circumstances and control change, weighing the balance of forces. When equilibrium is achieved, action follows—just as with the steelyard. The *quan* of antiquity carefully assessed weight and balance, acting only when it accorded with principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Compliance is the means by which *quan* is exercised.” The *Analects* says: “One may be guided to the Dao, but not to *quan*.” *Quan* reverses the norm yet aligns with the Dao; it contravenes conventional morality yet ultimately achieves good—like the blossoms of the *tangdi* tree, which turn back to face one another.\n\nWhen a filial son serves his parents, he softens his expression and humbles his bearing, fulfilling all duties of devotion and reverence. Yet if his father falls into the water, he seizes him by the hair to rescue him—not out of disrespect, but to save his life. Thus, to pull a drowning father from the water or to curse a ruler in prayer are acts born of necessity, the very purpose of *quan*.\n\nCompassion is the natural sentiment of humanity, yet “great righteousness severs kinship.” To sever kinship may bring greater honor—all for the sake of righteousness. Thus, when compassion and righteousness are weighed, righteousness prevails, and kinship may be set aside.\n\nExamples abound: Shun banished his arrogant brother Xiang; the Duke of Zhou executed his brother Guan Shu; Shi Que killed his son Shi Hou (Shi Que was a grandee of Wei, and his son Shi Hou rebelled, so Shi Que put him to death); and Ji You forced his brother Shu Ya to drink poison (Ji You was the younger brother of Duke Zhuang of Lu by the same mother, while Shu Ya was a half-brother. When Duke Zhuang fell ill, Shu Ya sought to enthrone his full brother, but the duke wished to enthrone Ji You instead. Ji You then hosted a feast at the home of Shu Ya’s elder brother, where he served Shu Ya wine. The elder brother warned, “To drink is to die.” Shu Ya drank and perished. Ji You then installed Shu Ya’s son to succeed his father’s position).\n\nTo weigh kinship against righteousness—these are cases of the same kind.\n\nTo deceive one’s father or countermand a ruler’s command are acts of rebellion for a minister or son. Yet when Shun took without reporting, or when Xian Gao falsified orders (Xian Gao was a merchant of Zheng who, while transporting goods abroad, encountered the Qin army poised to attack Zheng. He met them on the road and said, “The lord of Zheng knows of your army’s approach and has sent me with treasures to present to you.” The Qin forces concluded that Zheng was forewarned and prepared, so they seized his goods and withdrew, sparing Zheng. This was Xian Gao’s stratagem, using *quan* to repel the Qin troops), the gravity of extinguishing a lineage outweighed the transgression of failing to report or countermanding orders—this is the righteousness of *quan*.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails, there is no need for *quan*; when the Dao is lost, *quan* arises. The Dao in use is like clothing and caps upon the body; the weight of *quan* is like armor and helmets defending it. Armor and helmets cannot be worn constantly, nor can *quan* be employed at all times. Only the wise and sagacious can wield it properly.\n\n*Volume Eight of the Liuzi concludes here.*\n\n*Volume Nine of the Liuzi*\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou*\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three: Valuing Speed**\n\nThough achievements may be equal, swiftness in opportunity is paramount; though schemes may align, slowness is inferior. Why? Talent excels in success through speed, and wisdom shines in counsel through swiftness. Those who skillfully resolve matters are like rescuers of fire or drowning—those who devise plans are like fleet-footed steeds or swift arrows.\n\nNow, if a house is ablaze, one rushes to douse the flames; if a man is swept away by rapids, one hastens to pull him from the water. *You* is the name of a river. If one were to dig a well to extinguish a fire, the house would already be reduced to ashes; if one were to carve a boat to save a drowning man, he would already be buried in the belly of the river fish.\n\nThe steed is prized because it can cover a thousand *li* in a day—if it takes ten days to arrive, it is no better than a nag. The arrow is valued because it flies straight and true—if it takes a full day to reach its mark, it is no different from one that misses. Wisdom is marvelous because it responds to the moment—if one only knows after the fact, it is no better than ignorance.\n\nIn the past, Wu Qi served as minister to Chu. The noble clans attacked him, for Wu Qi, in governing Chu, enforced strict laws and stripped the noble clans of their ranks and titles, earning their hatred. When the King of Chu died and the crown prince had not yet arrived, the nobles sought to kill Wu Qi. Wu Qi fled into the royal palace and hid behind the king’s corpse. The nobles shot at him but missed. Hearing that the crown prince was near, Wu Qi pulled out the arrows and lodged them in the king’s corpse. Only then did he open the gates to meet the prince, saying, “The nobles have shot at the king’s corpse.” The prince, upon hearing this, executed all the nobles. This was Wu Qi’s swift vengeance—his success lay in speed.\n\nWu Qi wished to punish Yan, so he embedded arrows in the king’s corpse. When Yang Hu was besieged in Lu, the people of Lu released him. Yang Hu was a steward of the Ji clan, and Huanzi was the grandson of the Ji lord. Yang Hu had imprisoned Huanzi, but the people of Lu, believing his clan had caused chaos, sought to execute him. Huanzi escaped and ordered Yang Hu’s imprisonment. The people of Lu guarded the gates to keep Yang Hu in, but he said to them, “If you release me, I will bring you fortune.” They let him go. Once free, Yang Hu dragged a halberd and wounded the man who had released him. When Huanzi demanded to know Yang Hu’s whereabouts, the man replied, “Yang Hu escaped and struck me with his halberd. I could not seize him—this delay is my fault.” Yang Hu wished to repay a debt but wounded his benefactor with a halberd. His scheme repaid kindness with enmity in an instant—his wisdom was truly responsive to the moment.\n\nWhen Zhang Lu entered Qin—Zhang Lu was Fan Sui—he had been slandered in Wei, flogged three hundred times, and left for dead in a latrine. Later, he survived and disguised himself as Xu Jia. Wei Ran regretted not searching for him before departing, and so, when power shifted, he was exiled.\n\nWhen Chao Cuo tunneled through the palace wall, Shentu Jia regretted not executing him before submitting his memorial. The Han king’s inner offices were inconveniently located, so Chao Cuo dug through the palace wall to exit toward the offices. *Shu* was the name of the wall. Shentu Jia, the chancellor, memorialized the throne to execute Chao Cuo, but Chao Cuo, realizing his error, first entered to petition the king. The king, learning that Chao Cuo had tunneled through the wall to reach the offices, did not consider it a transgression. Only afterward did Shentu Jia submit his memorial, arguing that Chao Cuo’s act deserved death. The king replied, “This is merely the palace wall—it is no crime.” Chao Cuo was spared. Shentu Jia, filled with remorse, died of frustration. Thus, acting in anger to the point of death—if wisdom is not decisive early, failure leads only to regret. Such wisdom is no different from ignorance.\n\nTherefore, wisdom that cannot be applied is not true wisdom; ability that cannot respond swiftly is also not true wisdom. As the saying goes: *Strength values speed, and wisdom values suddenness.* This is what it means.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four: Assessing Capacity**\n\nThose who bend their thoughts upon trifles must forget the great; those who sharpen their focus on the near must neglect the far. For when the mind cannot dwell on both, affairs cannot be grasped in their entirety—what binds one to the small must cause one to forget the large.\n\nThus, one who looks up to thread a needle cannot see the heavens; one who looks down to pluck a louse cannot see the earth. Though heaven and earth are vast, they are unseen because the gaze is fixed upon needle and louse. Therefore, the wise know that petty ways hinder great tasks, and minute scrutiny harms grand clarity. They cast aside trivial discernment and relax their nature.\n\nFrom this perspective, those who engage in petty scrutiny and fine calculation must lack far-reaching ambition—one may likewise know the narrowness of their capacity.\n\nHow is this made clear? Seeing the stature of Jiao Yao, one knows it is not the measure of Fang Feng. (Jiao Yao was a guest from a land where its people stood three *chi* tall; Fang Feng was a state whose people stood four *zhang* tall.) Observing the tusk of an elephant, one knows it is larger than a boar’s; seeing the tail of a wildcat, one knows it is smaller than a leopard’s. Thus, glimpsing one thing allows one to know a hundred; observing this, one may understand that.\n\nTherefore, within a hoof-print’s hollow, no flood dragons are born; upon a burial mound’s rise, no pines or catalpas are planted. It is not that the nature of water and soil prevents their growth, but rather that the domain is too cramped.\n\nTo cook with but a few grains—such was Geng Sangzi.\n\nWeighing firewood before cooking—such was Yang Zhu, whose nature was narrow and prone to petty concerns. Not that he deliberately made things difficult, but his nature was inherently narrow and thus given to trivialities.\n\nXiang Yu never mastered a single art. When the King of Chu sent him in his youth to study calligraphy, he abandoned it before completion, saying, \"Calligraphy suffices only to record names.\" He then turned to swordsmanship, but as his skill extended no further than dueling a single man, he sought instead to learn the art of contending with ten thousand foes—later vying with Han for the realm. Thus, he spoke of forgoing calligraphy to study the sword.\n\nHan Xin never troubled himself with a single meal. Not that his heart lacked appreciation for skill or his palate for fine flavors, but his nature was too vast to be bound by trifling pursuits.\n\nWhen Wen of Jin planted rice—Jin’s literati sowing foreign grain—the seeds did not sprout, yet his ambition was great. When Zengzi planted sheep—Master Zeng of Lu learning from foreigners to bury sheep hide in soil—though nothing grew, his aspiration was grand. Not that their natures were dull or their minds unable to discern directions, but their scope was too broad to attend to minor tasks.\n\nWhen the cook of Zhi Bo lost a basket of seven-leaf-cut meat—some say he was the minister of Jin—the king knew his ambition was small, neglecting greater matters for lesser. Later, when the lords of Han and Wei plotted rebellion, he remained unaware; when his own demise drew near, he could not perceive it. Likewise, when Deng Ziyang’s garden lost a single peach—when a peach vanished from the garden of the King of Deng—the king noticed at once, yet when his ministers conspired to murder him, he failed to detect it. His mind was fixed on trifles, unable to contemplate weightier affairs.\n\nThus, though the angler may possess a fine rod, delicate line, sharp hook, and fragrant bait, and even augment his skill with the mastery of Zhan He—Zhan He, an ancient adept of the angling arts, who used silk thread for line, bent needles for hooks, and strung grains for bait, casting into abyssal pools to haul in cartloads of fish without snapping his line, bending his hook, or breaking his rod—he cannot rival the haul of a dragnet. Though the fowler may wield a mighty bow of *fanruo*, arrows from Kuaiji, and the cunning of Pu Ju—a skilled archer of Chu—he cannot match the yield of a kitchen sieve. Why is this?\n\nThe fault lies in the pettiness of the art. The currents of rivers and lakes may carry rotting carcasses and floating corpses, crisscrossing in tangled streams, yet men drink from them—because their capacity is vast. The water in a basin, if but a mouse’s tail stirs it, is spat out and discarded—because their capacity is small. The *ji* thorn sprouts but a few inches before branching, while the *yuzhang* tree stands a hundred feet tall with sparse limbs. Why is this? Is it not that a small nature yields dense foliage, while a great form bears few nodes?\n\nThus, the heart of the enlightened one embraces the profound and knows no bounds, while the narrow-minded cling to trivialities and fret over minutiae. Viewed from above, the paths of pursuit and abandonment, the breadth or constriction of one’s measure, are plainly discerned.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Adapting to the Times**\nTimes may be pure or turbid, customs refined or barbaric—one cannot govern them with a single Dao, nor unify them with a single form. Thus, non-action transformed the age of the Three Sovereigns; laws and techniques governed the era of the Seven Warring States; virtue and righteousness softened the hearts of the Central Kingdom; and policies and punishments awed the natures of the Four Barbarians. Therefore, the *Yijing* values adapting to the times, and ritual esteems following customs—acting in accord with the moment.\n\nWhen frost-laden winds howl fiercely, Zhou’s farmers do not grasp their sickles; when scorching heat blazes, Cao’s herdsmen do not stitch furs—knowing the time is not right. Those who peddle ceremonial caps do not venture into Min or Yue (two southern kingdoms), nor do those who hawk straw sandals enter *Guangxia* (a region where people go bareheaded and barefoot)—knowing the customs are unsuited.\n\nThus, to save the starving, a pearl the size of a thumbnail is not as good as acorns and beans (acorns being the fruit of the oak, beans being soybeans); to rescue the drowning, a jade slab a foot square is not as good as a short rope. It is not that acorns and ropes are precious while pearls and jade are base, but that beauty is useless where urgency lies. In the face of hunger and drowning, can pearls and jade save lives?\n\nWhen a boat founders midstream, a single gourd is worth a thousand gold—value is not constant, for the times dictate it. Once, when Qin attacked Liang, King Hui of Liang said to Meng Ke: “Sir, you have not disdained the thousand *li* to grace our humble state. Now Qin attacks Liang—how shall we repel them?” Meng Ke replied: “In ancient times, when the Di tribes attacked Tai Wang at Bin, he offered them jade and silk, but they refused. Unwilling to harm his people, Tai Wang abandoned Bin and settled at Qi. Why not leave Liang now?” The king was displeased. What Liang treasured was its state—how could he abandon it? Such counsel was not what he needed, no different from offering pearls to the starving or jade to the drowning.\n\nWhen Duke Xiao of Qin asked Shang Yang about governing Qin, Shang Yang advocated harsh laws and severe punishments. After three years, the people prospered, the army grew strong, and the state flourished, its might subduing the feudal lords. Meng Ke’s discourse on benevolence and righteousness—citing Tai Wang’s abandonment of Bin—proved unfit for the age, while Shang Yang’s shallow and draconian methods succeeded. It is not that benevolence and righteousness are impracticable or that harshness is admirable, but that in an era of shifting alliances, governance must differ. In the age of vertical and horizontal pacts, benevolence and righteousness could not be fully realized.\n\nThus, a bright mirror serves to reflect one’s face, but the blind use it to cover their cups; jade hairpins adorn the head, but the bald crone hangs them on her loom. It is not that the mirror or jade are flawed, but that they are useless to them.\n\nPao Ding carved oxen, suiting the common need (Pao Ding was a butcher in the time of Duke Wen of Jin); Zhu Han slaughtered dragons, his skill of no use (Zhu Han spent a thousand gold to learn dragon-slaying from Tai Long, yet his art found no application in the world). If one strays from the affairs of the age, even the most wondrous arts become useless.\n\nThus, when Laozi journeyed to the Western Rong, he imitated their crude speech; when Yu the Great entered the *Duo* state, he loosened his robes and bared his shoulders—not out of disdain for ritual, but to follow local custom. Mozi, who practiced frugality and opposed music (deeming it wasteful, as men neglect farming and women abandon weaving for its sake), once visited the King of Jing wearing brocade and playing the sheng—adapting to the king’s preferences. It was not that he betrayed his nature, but that he followed the tastes of the time.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu favored Confucian attire and was reduced to ruin; enamored of Confucian conduct, he was annihilated by Jin. The Lord of Dai cultivated Mohist ways and met destruction—Mohist, that is, Confucian. The lord of the state of Dai delighted in practicing benevolence and righteousness, offering his kingdom in abdication. The recipient accepted, and the lord of Dai was exiled among the people, where he lived out his days in old age. Duke Yan of Xu practiced benevolence and perished; fond of benevolence and righteousness, he was destroyed by the King of Chu. Yan Qiang embraced righteousness and was annihilated; devoted to benevolence and righteousness, he was slain by his brother-in-law, Viscount Xiang of Zhao, at Huiji. Such ruin, destruction, and annihilation are the consequences of violent disorder, yet these rulers encountered them through the practice of benevolence, righteousness, Confucianism, and Mohism—not because benevolence, righteousness, Confucianism, or Mohism are ineffective, but because their practice was unsuited to the times.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Customs and Mores**\n*Feng* is qi; *su* is habit. The land, water, and springs give rise to qi of varying intensity, and sounds of differing pitch—this is called *feng*. People dwelling in such a place grow accustomed to it and form their nature—this is called *su*. *Feng* may be thick or thin; *su* may be pure or shallow. The transforming influence of a sagely king should refine customs to make them refined, and reform habits to make them upright. Thus, the transformation of superiors over inferiors becomes *feng*; the practices people adopt and follow become *su*.\n\nThe *feng* of Chu and Yue favors courage; their *su* rushes to death without hesitation. The *feng* of Zheng and Wei favors licentiousness; their *su* is frivolous and forgets to return home. Jin preserves the lingering *feng* of Tang and Yu; its *su* values frugality and thrift. Qi retains the residual influence of Duke Jing; its *su* is extravagant and boastfully competitive. Grand Consort Tai Ji, who had no sons, was fond of shamans and prayers—Tai Ji was the eldest daughter of King Mu of Zhou, named Hu Ji, and wife of the Marquis of Chen. Childless, she revered ghosts and spirits, praying for blessings in hopes of bearing a son. The people of the state, observing this, came to honor and serve ghosts and spirits. Their *su* thus involved serving ghosts and spirits to pray for good fortune.\n\nPrince Dan of Yan gathered retainers and brave warriors in his rear palace, treating Jing Ke as a guest of honor and lodging him among his concubines, where his consorts and concubines attended to him. Later, the people of Yan imitated this, sending their wives and concubines to serve any guest as a mark of profound respect—though this was contrary to propriety. Their custom thus became to offer wives and concubines to guests. All these were transformations of local *feng* into enduring *su*, shaped by what the people observed and practiced.\n\nTo the east of Yue lay the state of Womu, where, upon a father’s death, the son would carry his mother away and abandon her, declaring her a ghost unfit to share a dwelling. When the eldest son was born, they would carve up meat to feed him, and the mother would call this \"fitting for a younger brother.\" To the south of Chu lay a land of man-eaters, where, when a relative died, they would strip the flesh and bury the bones, calling this filial piety. To the west of Qin lay the state of Yiqu, where, upon a person’s death, they would gather firewood and burn the body until the smoke rose to the heavens, calling this \"ascending in mist.\" To the north of the Hu lay the state of Shegu, where, when a relative died, they would cast the corpse into the river, calling this \"becoming a water immortal.\" All these were the peculiar customs of the Four Barbarians.\n\nThe Former Kings, grieved by the corruption of *feng* and *su*, established rites and teachings to curb their excesses, fashioning ritual and music to harmonize human nature. Thus, when *feng* was transformed and *su* reformed, the world was set right.\n\n**Section Forty-Seven: Advantage and Harm**\nAdvantage and harm are the roots of gain and loss; gain and loss are the sources of success and failure. Thus, to pursue advantage and avoid harm, to cherish gain and detest loss, is the natural inclination of all things. All know to seek advantage and shun harm, yet none recognize how harm may reveal advantage; all understand the desire for gain and aversion to loss, yet none perceive how loss may lead to gain. One who grasps that advantage may become harm, harm may become advantage, gain may turn to loss, and loss may turn to gain—such a person may be spoken to of advantage and harm, gain and loss.\n\nThose with internal heat drink poison not because it is harmless, nor do those with abscesses endure the lancet’s pain without reason. They do so because a small pain dispels a greater one, a minor harm removes a grave danger. Yet to eat twice one’s fill when hungry, to drink excessively when thirsty, to plunge into water when hot, or to leap into fire when cold—though these may briefly soothe the senses, they inevitably bring later calamity. The fragrant herb *jupu* repels fleas and lice but attracts centipedes; *fanshi* halts the pain of tooth decay yet rots the roots. Though the immediate pain may cease, greater harm follows. This is to grasp at small advantages while forgetting greater ones, to shun minor harms while incurring grave ones.\n\nOne with a festering sore on the chest dares not lance it; one stung by a scorpion’s tail dares not cut it away—not out of love for the affliction or the venom, but because lancing or cutting would worsen the sting. A goblet brims with poisoned wine, yet the thirsty man does not drink—not because he is not thirsty, but because drinking would bring instant death. Molten gold glows in the furnace, yet the thief does not scoop it—not because he does not desire it, but because seizing it would burn his flesh. A three-eyed tiger crouches before him, or a *Sui* pearl lies on the ground: though a thief as greedy as Robber Zhi might leap to snatch it, his hands would not dare reach. A dagger points at his heart, or Xi Shi walks by: though a man as lewd as Jing Yang might gaze, his eyes would not linger—not because he does not love treasure or delight in beauty, but because the harm is urgent while the advantage is distant.\n\nOnce in Qi, a merchant displayed fine silk in the marketplace. A thief snatched it from the crowd, and when the officials seized him and asked, \"Why did you steal the silk in plain sight?\" he replied, \"I saw only the silk, not the people.\" Such a man is dazzled by advantage and forgets harm. A fledgling, greedy for bait, forgets danger and is caught in the net. When Confucius saw a fowler, he asked why the man caught only small yellow-beaked birds but not larger ones. The fowler replied, \"The small birds are greedy for bait and easily caught; the larger ones are cunning and refuse to take it, so they are hard to trap.\" The magpie, seeing advantage, forgets itself—yet it rested in Zhuang Zhou’s garden. Zhuang Zhou entered his garden at Diaoling, where a magpie with a seven-foot tail perched, a strange sight indeed. Zhou raised his sling to shoot it, but his heart trembled in fear: \"This is the king’s chestnut grove. If I shoot the magpie now, the king might hear of it and accuse me of stealing his chestnuts.\" So he lowered his sling and withdrew.\n\nThus, the wise see advantage and think of peril; fools see advantage and forget danger. Those who think of peril may avoid it, while those who forget danger invite it. From this, the principles of advantage and harm, of approach and retreat, become clear.\n\n**Section Forty-Eight: Fortune and Misfortune**\nFortune and misfortune share the same root; omens and portents dwell in the same realm. Where misfortune leans, it may turn to fortune; where fortune lies hidden, it may become misfortune. Where omens appear, they may bring good; where portents descend, they may turn to ill. One who understands how misfortune becomes fortune, fortune becomes misfortune, omens become good, and portents become ill—such a person may be spoken to of the nature of things.\n\nKing Helü of Wu won a great victory and deemed it fortune, yet it led to the hardship of Gusu. When Helü battled King Goujian of Yue at the foot of Mount Kuaiji, he triumphed and returned home, where he began constructing the Terrace of Gusu. For seven years, the terrace remained unfinished, and later, when Goujian saw the people suffering by the Five Lakes, he raised an army and destroyed Wu. What began as fortune became a great misfortune.\n\nKing Goujian of Yue took refuge at Kuaiji and deemed it misfortune, yet it led to his hegemony over the Five Lakes. When the king of Yue raised his army to attack Wu, he was utterly defeated. The Rong king, relying on his strength, deemed it fortune, yet it led to his capture beneath the wine vessel. The Rong king, trusting in his might, overthrew King You, but later, You’s grandson captured and killed him beneath a wine vessel.\n\nChen Pian’s exile was deemed misfortune, yet it ultimately brought the fortune of generous favor. When the Duke of Chen’s son fled to Qi, the Marquis of Qi received him with great courtesy, bestowed upon him rich gifts, and even betrothed his daughter to him—this was fortune indeed. Thus do misfortune and fortune revolve, defying easy prediction.\n\nOnce, a man of Song had a white calf born to his black ox, which he took as an auspicious omen, yet it brought the misfortune of blindness. Though stricken with blindness, this misfortune later became the fortune of survival. A family in Song had a black ox that bore a white calf, and they went to consult Confucius. Confucius said, “This is an auspicious sign.” Later, they slaughtered the calf for sacrifice, and the ox’s owner’s son lost his right eye. Another white calf was born, and they again consulted Confucius. Confucius said, “It is auspicious.” They slaughtered it once more, and the ox’s owner’s elder brother lost his left eye. When Chu later attacked Song, the people of Song were all conscripted as soldiers and perished in battle—only the blind father and son survived.\n\nA northern elder possessed a fine Hu horse, which brought advantage, yet it ultimately led to the misfortune of a fall. Though he suffered this misfortune, it became the fortune of preserving his life. A man from the northern frontier had a stallion that fled into Hu territory. After three years, it returned leading a herd of Hu horses. The man’s son, fond of riding, was thrown by the horse and broke his leg. When the Hu later invaded the northern frontier, all the men were pressed into military service. In battle, none survived, and all were slain by the Hu—only this man, his aged father, and his lame son escaped, spared by the Hu soldiers. Thus misfortune may give rise to fortune.\n\nIf one perceives inauspicious signs and cultivates goodness, then omens reverse and become auspicious. If one sees auspicious signs yet fails to do good, then auspiciousness reverts to ominousness. In the time of King Wu Ding of Yin, mulberry and catalpa trees grew entwined in the court—a portent, for both are ill-omened trees. When trees cluster in the court, it is a monstrous sign. The historian divined, “Wild plants growing in the court—does this not foretell the court’s demise?” Wu Ding was filled with dread and reformed himself through virtue. The mulberry and catalpa withered of their own accord, and within the eight directions, distant peoples came bearing tribute, reviving the Yin dynasty.\n\nIn the time of King Di Xin, a sparrow hatched a kite—a bird of prey—at the corner of the city. The *Book of Songs* says, “The kite soars to heaven,” referring to birds of prey like the osprey. The *Main Chapters* states, “The peng and hong are birds that devour evil.” The historian divined, “A small creature giving birth to a great one—this portends the kingdom’s rise to supremacy.” Yet Di Xin grew arrogant and cruel, and the Yin dynasty perished.\n\nThus do monstrous omens serve as warnings to rulers, just as strange dreams warn the common people. If good governance prevails over monstrous omens, then calamity reverses into fortune. If virtuous words prevail over strange dreams, then fortune turns from misfortune. When misfortune befalls a man, he must fear; in fear, he becomes reverent; in reverence, fortune comes; in fortune, joy arises; in joy, arrogance follows; in arrogance, misfortune returns. Therefore, the noble man, upon receiving auspicious signs, does not rejoice excessively but remains reverent and frugal, cultivating sincerity. When omens appear, he does not grieve excessively but focuses on cultivating virtue. Thus does he summon blessings from the spirits, dispel disaster, and invite fortune.\n\nGreed for small gains is the undoing of great profit; petty stinginess is the ford to great calamity. If one covets small gains, great profit will surely be lost; if one clings to petty stinginess, great calamity will surely arrive. The Lord of Shu was by nature greedy. When King Hui of Qin heard of this and wished to conquer him, the mountain ravines were too treacherous for an army to pass. So he carved stones into the shape of oxen, laden with gold, placing them behind the oxen each day, calling it “ox dung” and claiming it as a gift for the Lord of Shu. The Lord of Shu, covetous, ordered the mountains leveled and valleys filled, sending five mighty laborers to retrieve the stone oxen. The Qin army followed in their wake, annihilating the state and destroying the lord, becoming a laughingstock for all under heaven—for coveting small gains, he lost his great profit.\n\nBai Gong Sheng of Chu was by nature greedy and stingy. He was the lord of Bai County in Chu. Bai Gong, whose name was Sheng, rebelled and raised an army to seize the state of Jing, killing the Chu minister Zi Xi. After killing Zi Xi and seizing Jing, he amassed wealth and treasures, filling his storehouses, refusing to share with the people. Shi admonished him, “Now that disaster has come, the state is in peril and unstable. The pivot of victory or defeat, survival or ruin, is already clear in your heart. If you cannot distribute wealth to win the people’s hearts, you might as well burn it, lest the people turn against you and harm you.” But he would not listen. When the Earl of Ye entered the city, Sheng opened the great treasury to distribute wealth to the people and emptied the storehouses to bestow treasures upon them. They rose up and attacked him, and after nineteen days, Bai Gong perished. Wealth does not belong to oneself, yet he desired to possess it—through this petty stinginess, great calamity arose.\n\nIn the cold northern lands, there is a beast called the *bao*, found in the mountains of the five regions. It has the body of a sheep, the face of a man, eyes beneath its armpits, and horns growing from its chest. Its cry is like that of an infant, and it is fiercely greedy, known as the *taotie*. The beast loves to sharpen its horns, making them keen for use, yet this only enrages its heart, causing its *qi* to congeal within until it dies. Its horns grow from its chest, and as it bends to grind them, its heart becomes enraged, and it dies.\n\nIn the southern lands, there is a bird called the *xiao*, a yin bird that dwells in caves to raise its young. When the chicks grow, they devour their mother before taking flight. This is the modern *chixiao*. The *Book of Songs* says, “O *chixiao*, O *chixiao*, you depart singing and return wailing,” foretelling first fortune, then misfortune—this refers to the *tuniao*. The mother broods over her chicks for a hundred days until they mature. Once their wings are fully grown, they eat their mother and fly away.\n\nThe Lord of Shu’s welcoming of the Qin oxen brought them ever closer, yet his own peril grew—how is this different from the beast grinding its horns, sharpening them until its own demise? Bai Gong’s hoarding of wealth only deepened his ruin—how is this different from the *xiao* raising its young, only for them to grow and destroy it? Thus the wise man perceives the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, discerns the origins of success and failure, and does not harm himself through reckless gain or endanger himself through excessive stinginess.\n\nThe *Laozi* states: \"Excessive hoarding invites profound loss.\" The *Book of Rites* says: \"Accumulate yet know when to disperse.\" Both clarify the bounds of contentment and sever the sprouts of greed and stinginess.\n\n**Category Fifty: Resonance by Kind**\nThings gather by kind, creatures divide by group; sounds respond through harmony, qi diverges through discord. If their kind gathers, though distant they do not part; if their group divides, though near they never unite. Thus when the copper mountain in Shu collapsed, bells rang in response at Ya; in the Jin era, when the copper mountain in Shu crumbled, all bronze vessels—bells and chimes—throughout the land resonated in unison. Though the Zi and Mian rivers share a single stream, their colors and flavors differ in essence; yet resonance by kind is the inevitable pattern of nature. During the Jin dynasty, Zhang Hua distinguished flavors; when the Prince of Jin blended the waters of the Zi and Mian to make a broth and offered it to Zhang Hua, he tasted it and immediately said: \"This broth bears the flavors of both the Zi and Mian rivers.\"\n\nThus creatures that take flight belong to the group of yang, while those that burrow and crouch belong to the kind of yin. Hence at the summer solstice, deer shed their antlers—on the summer solstice, deer lose their antlers, while on the winter solstice, elk shed theirs. When the moon wanes, clams and oysters diminish—clams and oysters grow when the moon darkens, and when the moon is new, pearls transform into oysters, an ancient constant. As recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: \"When the sun and moon wane, clams and oysters diminish.\" *Diminish* here means *to grow*. When the qilin perishes, the sun is eclipsed; when the whale dies, comets appear. When the east wind arrives, wine overflows its vessels; when silkworms spin their threads, merchants’ silk supplies are cut off; when the new grain is harvested, the old grain is depleted. When a dragon rises from a single well, clouds spread across the nine heavens—long ago, Boyi dug a well, and as he struck water, a dragon summoned rain that ascended to the nine heavens, while dark clouds descended in majesty to blanket the earth. When a tiger roars in one valley, winds fan across ten thousand miles. The yang mirror in the palm ignites fire from the sun.\n\nThe sun is the great yang, and the yang mirror is the fire-mirror. When the fire-mirror reflects the sun, fire descends in response. The square pearl turns in the palm and summons the lesser yin water—lesser yin is the moon. The square pearl’s water is clear; when the pearl becomes a water-mirror and reflects the moon, water flows forth in response. This is resonance by kind.\n\nWhen the Winnowing Basket constellation aligns with the moon, whirlwinds arise; when the Net constellation stirs in the heavens, sudden rains scatter. When the sky is about to send wind, not a speck of dust stirs yet the *wu*-day crows—*wu*-day refers to the crow, a bird resembling a chicken that delights in eating snakes. When rain is coming at dawn, not a wisp of cloud has spread yet the ants and earthworms shift. Those that dwell in nests know wind; those that burrow in holes recognize rain. As wind and rain approach, birds and insects respond. When the radiance of Venus gleams, roosters must crow at night. When the essence of fire blazes brightly, horses must startle at dawn.\n\nThe rooster belongs to the trigram *dui*, which is metal and governs the rooster. Metal is the essence of weapons; the horse is the creature of the trigram *li*, which is fire and governs the horse. Fire is the martial spirit, and weapons rise daily. This is the omen of rebellion—when a man’s head is hung upside down upon a spear, it is called a \"captive’s head.\" When armored steeds prepare to move, creatures in armor and beasts respond.\n\nWhen the giant soft-shelled turtle cries in the wild, its kind answers from the depths. When the male flying serpent calls from the upwind, the female calls from downwind, and they transform into form. Such is the resonance of utmost essence: they need not be summoned but respond of themselves, like kind to kind—just as a call elicits an echo, a form casts its shadow.\n\nThus, when one carries firewood to extinguish a fire, the driest kindling ignites first; when water is poured upon level ground, the dampest places are soaked first. When a bow is plucked, the eye trembles; when a boat is drummed, waves surge. Things resonate by kind; spirits transform through qi—how could this be a matter of human sentiment?\n\n*Liuzi*, Scroll Nine concludes\n*Liuzi*, Scroll Ten begins\n\n**Liuzi, Scroll Ten**\n\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou*\n\n**On Proper Judgment (Fifty-First)**\n\nJudgment serves to discern truth; critique serves to uphold principle. If judgment is not just, truth becomes entangled with falsehood; if critique is not balanced, principle strays from reality. The loss of principle stems from revering the ancient and scorning the present; the confusion of truth arises from trusting hearsay and dismissing what the eye beholds. Though past and present differ, their proximity to the imperial era is the same; though ears and eyes perceive differently, their capacity for discernment is equal. If discernment is equal yet judgment varies, it cannot be called just; if proximity is the same yet critique diverges, it cannot be called fair. When critique is just yet all is overturned, both truth and principle fall into chaos.\n\nConsider how men of today find it easy to skillfully depict ghosts and demons, yet struggle to render dogs and horses with precision. Why? Ghosts and demons are formless, while dogs and horses are manifest. The formless may be adorned with grotesqueries to display marvelous shapes, but the manifest cannot be falsified without exposing their true nature—thus, their reality reveals their wonder. To conjure strangeness from the formless is to pass off falsehood as truth; to model after true forms is to doubt truth as falsehood.\n\nIn ancient times, Duke Ai of Lu longed for the worthies Ji and Xie, yet failed to recognize the sagacity of Confucius; Duke Jing of Qi extolled the strategies of Guan Zhong, yet remained oblivious to the wisdom of Yan Ying. Zhang Bosong—of the Han dynasty—admired the erudition of Dong Zhongshu, yet overlooked the brilliance of Yang Ziyun. Confucius’ sagacity was no less radiant than Ji and Xie’s; Yan Ying’s worth was no lesser than Guan Zhong’s; Yang Ziyun’s talent was no inferior to Dong Zhongshu’s. Yet they were not esteemed—was this not because men prize the distant and scorn the near, treasure hearsay and despise sight, valuing empty renown while disparaging true substance?\n\nSuch worldly judgments are not made arbitrarily to exalt one and belittle another, to embellish names while undermining reality. Rather, they arise from the mingling of good and evil, the difficulty of distinguishing truth from falsehood. Men measure things by sentiment, trusting their hearts to determine right and wrong. Yet when the heart weighs the weight of a hair’s tip, none can discern it; but suspend it from a balance, and the slightest weight becomes clear. Thus, the sage knew that right and wrong are hard to clarify, light and heavy hard to determine, and so established standards to measure the nature of things. A balance, once hung, cannot be deceived in weight; a marking line, once laid, cannot be falsified in straightness; compass and square, once set, cannot be misled in shape. Therefore, to measure things by standards is to easily distinguish truth from falsehood; to trust the heart in judging principle is to obscure right and wrong.\n\nA man of Yue served a guest of Qin a dish of snake, which the guest savored, mistaking it for carp. Only upon learning it was snake did he clutch his throat and retch—this was a failure to know true flavor. A man of Zhao passed off a vulgar tune as the music of Bo Ya, and the world rushed to learn it. When they later discovered the deception, they bound their fingers and ceased—this was a failure to know true sound. A man of Song took a stone from Yan for fine jade, encasing it in a bronze casket. When he learned it was mere stone, he cast aside the casket—this was a failure to recognize true jade. A man of Ying composed a fu and attributed it to Qu Yuan, and the world recited it. When they learned it was not his, they sealed their lips and discarded it—this was a failure to know true literature. Thus, only Yi Ya did not mistake snake for carp in flavor; only Zhong Ziqi did not err in recognizing the vulgar tune’s discordance; only Qi Dun—of Qin, skilled in jade—did not confuse the stone of Yan for true jade; only Sima Xiangru did not overpraise the Ying fu’s ornate verses.\n\nOnce, two men appraised a piece of jade. One called it fine; the other, ugly. After long debate, neither could convince the other. Each said: “If you place it before my eyes, fine and ugly will be clear.” The jade’s form was fixed, yet their judgments differed—not out of mere contradiction, but because their eyes saw differently. A hall’s pearls and curtains, adorned with golden splendor, shimmer with radiant hues, dazzling the eye. Yet a drunken man, his gaze unsteady, calls them flames—though the hall’s adornments remain unchanged, his eyes have altered. A mirror shaped like a cup reflects Xi Shi: when held vertically, her face appears long; when held horizontally, it appears broad. Not that Xi Shi’s beauty changed, but the reflection did. Those who dwell by the sea see islands as boats and boats as gulls, yet those who seek boats do not sail to islands, nor do archers aim at gulls when they mean to shoot boats—knowing that distant sight confuses the eye and misleads the heart. Those who walk at the foot of a mountain see ridge-top trees as hairpins and ravine tigers as dogs, yet those who seek hairpins do not climb the trees, nor do they call out to dogs—knowing that height distorts vision and bewilders the heart. Yet when men observe others or critique literature, they mistake greatness for pettiness, ability for baseness, unaware that their eyes are deceived and their hearts confused—is this not the opposite of gazing upon mountains and seas?\n\nOnce, Confucius ate millet before other foods. His attendants stifled their laughter. Confucius said: “Millet is the chief of the five grains, so I eat it first.” Ziyou wore a coarse robe and spoke broadly, and Zeng Shen wagged his fingers in mockery. The conduct of sages and worthies was not in error, yet they could not escape ridicule—how much harder, then, for men of no renown to avoid scorn in their bearing and literary grace? From this, we see that right may be called wrong, beauty may be deemed ugliness, and names and realities may be inverted—truly, a cause for lament.\n\nNow, those who expound principle entrust it to the discerning. The noble man, wise and enlightened, surpasses what he has heard before; his clear mirror reveals what lies beyond expectation. He is not dazzled by names and realities, nor swayed by the bias of past and present. He grasps the essence of intent, disregards extraneous embellishment, neither obscures the smallest good nor eclipses the faintest light. Such a one may be called a once-in-a-thousand-years encounter.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two: The Power of Stimulation**\n\nThose who ascend sheer peaks long to gaze afar;\nthose who stand at the edge of deep ravines cannot help but peer into the ruins below.\nRuins and tombs stir sorrow in the heart,\nwhile within the hallowed temple, reverence arises of itself.\nThough no intent is present, emotions and pretense arise—\nfor the land’s very contours compel them.\n\nThus, swift snowdrifts gather at the borders of desolate cities,\nand fierce winds often rise above the sandy rivers.\nSelf-mastery is likened to the folk who dwell by earthen windows,\nwhile short-lived fate befalls those who swallow their breath in silence.\nWhy is this so?\nFrigid, barren lands are where wind and snow accumulate;\nardent hearts are where loyalty and righteousness converge.\n\nThus, knotted roots and gnarled burls form the brocade-like burls of trees,\nwhile clams and oysters, in healing their wounds, enfold luminous pearls.\nWhen a bird takes flight, it soars amid the azure clouds;\nwhen an arrow is loosed in alarm, it strikes the snowy peaks.\nDuke Mu of Qin once ordered a bow to be made, and after three years, it was completed.\nWhen the duke used it to shoot, the arrow failed to pierce even a single lamella of armor.\nEnraged, he sought to execute the bowyer.\nThe bowyer’s daughter came before the duke and said:\n“My father labored for years to craft this bow.\nThe mulberry wood was taken from a sunlit mountain—\nI checked its growth thrice daily.\nThe ox was glued with spring adhesive, reinforced with elk sinew,\nand the arrow’s binding was meticulously woven.\nThree years passed before the bow was finished.\nNow, when Your Majesty shoots, the arrow fails to pierce even one lamella—\ndoes this mean my father deserves death?\nI have heard that in the art of archery,\nthe left hand must be firm as if gripping a tiger,\nthe right hand steady as if supporting a branch.\nThe left hand releases, while the right remains unaware.\nYour Majesty does not understand shooting—\nwhy seek to kill my father?”\n\nUpon hearing this, Duke Mu took the bow and shot at the tiger pen.\nThe arrow flew past the mountains, surpassing the bounds of Pengcheng,\nits force greater than that of a stone beam.\nThe arrowhead sank so deep that even its fletching disappeared—\nyet the bow’s full strength had not been spent.\n\nAll these are instances where hardship forges treasures of radiant pattern,\nand where stimulation gives rise to lofty and far-reaching power.\nThe rush of a gale can snap trees,\nand the surge of rapids must dislodge stones.\nWind is insubstantial by nature, water weak in essence—\nyet they can fell sturdy trees and roll heavy stones,\nfor it is the force of stimulation that achieves this.\n\nThus, those who dwell in obscurity cannot think far,\nand those who never face peril cannot harbor grand ambitions.\nHad Su Qin possessed fertile fields near the capital,\nhe would never have worn the seals of the Six States.\nAs he himself said:\n*“Had I fifty *mu* of land near the capital,\nI would never have worn the seals of the Six States.”*\nHad King Wuling lacked the scorn of kin and friends,\nhe would never have aspired to the feast of five tripods.\n\nThe term *mie* means \"to belittle.\" Master Father, named Yan, was a man of Chu. Fond of learning yet poor in family, he was bullied by his relatives and friends. Later, in the Han dynasty, he rose to become a minister and was granted the feast of five tripods, dining to the sound of bells, with a fief of three hundred households.\n\nHad Zhang Yi not endured the humiliation at the hall’s steps, he would never have harbored the ambition to enter Qin. Had Fan Sui not suffered the disgrace in the privy, he would not have nurtured the resolve to return to Wei. Yu Yue, spurred by hardship, refined his scholarship and ultimately became the teacher of King Wei of Zhou. Ban Chao, roused by indignation, practiced martial arts and eventually achieved merit in the Western Regions. Xiao Yue, impoverished in his youth, worked as a hired laborer. At thirty, he devoted himself to study, resting neither day nor night for fifteen years. Through his learning, he attained eminence, and King Wei of Qi appointed him as his teacher.\n\nObserving these worthies, we see that all were stirred to ambition by adversity and rose to fame through struggle. Thus, the five-crossroads highway on the plain is easy to traverse, while the solitary peak’s nine-fold path is a treacherous climb. Descending from heights is within even a mediocre horse’s stride, but scaling sheer cliffs demands the agility of a flying squirrel. It is by overcoming peril that one gains esteem, and by surmounting difficulty that one proves worthy.\n\nThe heroes of old thrived in hardship and expanded in constraint. Each possessed talent and wisdom, and when their time came, they were employed by the world.\n\n**Cherishing Time, Fifty-Three**\nWhen a lamp is placed upon a stand, the flame that burns now is not the flame that burned before, yet the wise cannot perceive this. When a mountain is concealed in a marsh, its present form is not its past form, yet the discerning cannot know it. Why? The fire is extinguished moment by moment, and the mountain shifts imperceptibly.\n\nHeaven’s revolution is called \"turning,\" its passing swift as an arrow—even the fleetest divine steed cannot overtake it. Man’s brief life is like a spark struck from stone, flashing by in an instant. Only the establishment of virtue and the bequeathal of love endure beyond death.\n\nThe noble men of old, wishing to practice benevolence and righteousness throughout the world, raced against time, prizing not a foot of jade but every inch of fleeting light. Thus, Great Yu, hastening to seize the moment, left his cap hanging without a glance. Nan Rong, seeking the Dao, wore out his sandals without rest. The disciples of Laozi, ashamed to question their master, pressed on. Confucius, ever urgent, had no time to blacken his stove; Mo Di, ever restless, could not warm his mat. All practiced their virtue, rescued the world from drowning, established merit, and left models for a hundred generations.\n\nYet men today advance without knowing retreat. Dazzled by decaying splendor, they carve away their desires, adorn themselves with fine strings and songs, and curry favor with scenic springs and rocks. In retreat, they cannot wield the brush to record deeds or aid an enlightened age. They consume millet like locusts, wasting their years. In life, they become men of no renown; in death, they are but a coffin’s dust—how do they differ from plants that live and die unnoticed?\n\nWhen autumn arrives, the freezing wind howls through the branches, and the clear dew transforms the leaves. Then the cold cicada clings to the tree, crying out in bitter lament. Why? As its time nears and its life is pressed by the harsh frost, it laments even the withered willow. Now, as I face the western peak, my Daoist practice remains unfulfilled. My voice is stifled in the shadow of barren cliffs, unheard in this flourishing age. How can I avoid being stained by the soot of future generations or tainted by the ink of pine smoke?\n\n**Garden of Words, Fifty-Four**\nLoyalty and filial piety are the treasures of all conduct. Without cultivating loyalty and filial piety, even if one possesses other virtues, it is like a storehouse filled with jade fragments—unfit to be carved into ritual scepters—or a basket brimming with silk threads—unusable for weaving fine sashes. However much there is, of what use is it?\n\nTrust and yielding are the harmony of all conduct; deceit and boasting are its perversion. When trust and yielding deviate from ritual, they become perverse; when deceit and boasting align with righteousness, they become harmonious.\n\nZhi Gong testified against his father: though his father stole a sheep and his son exposed him, his conduct was upright yet contrary to ritual. Cangwu yielded to his elder brother: though he gave his beautiful wife to his brother and took her as his sister-in-law, his yielding was not in accord with ritual. Thus, even trust and yielding can become perverse.\n\nXian Gao falsified a royal command: though he deceived as a merchant, his act was still deemed harmonious. Great Yu spoke boldly: his boasting was in accord with righteousness. He denounced Jie and Zhou with fiery anger and compared kings to Boyi and Shuqi with joyful approval. Where benevolence and righteousness reside, even a common man is weighty; where they depart, even the exalted are light.\n\nMatters can be assured through sincerity, and principles can be understood through empathy. By the brightness of the autumn moon, one knows the longing of a widow; by the rustling of the forest wind, one perceives the alarm of a boatman.\n\nYang qi governs life, which all things delight in; yin qi governs death, which all things regret. Thus, spring blossoms bask in the sun as if smiling, while autumn leaves weep with dew. The good at friendship do not alter their intentions with parting or reunion, nor shift their feelings with life or death. They remain the same at the end as at the beginning, like the sun and moon—both bright at rising and setting, both whole in waxing and waning.\n\nHeaven is impartial toward life and death; one cannot resent it for its nature. Thus, in the warmth of spring, the flourishing do not give thanks, and in the chill of autumn, the withering do not lament. Flourishing and withering follow fate; hardship and fortune have their appointed times.\n\nThough spring herbs thrive, they rely on morning dew to unfurl their verdure; though autumn leaves are fragile, they fall at the touch of a gentle breeze. All things are supple in warmth and harden in cold. Thus, spring horns can be coiled, summer branches can be knotted, autumn dew can congeal, and winter ice can be shattered.\n\nMen all love youth and despise old age, cherish glory and disdain decay. They adorn themselves with blossoming splendor yet burn the ashes of withered remains, unaware that withered remains arise from blossoming splendor, and blossoming splendor returns to withered remains.\n\nMountains harboring jade are quarried; rivers holding pearls are drained. Leopards bearing patterns are flayed; men possessing wisdom are envied.\n\nWisdom can know others but cannot know itself; spirit can protect things but cannot protect itself. Thus, the divine tortoise is scorched for its wisdom, the sacred serpent is exposed for its spirit—who knows that unwisdom is wisdom, and spiritlessness is spirit?\n\nThe wondrous must rely on things, yet things do not generate the wondrous; skill must depend on tools, yet tools do not perfect skill. Thus, Yi could not hit the smallest target without bow and arrow, yet what hit the target was not the bow and arrow. The hammer cannot split well without axe and adze, yet what splits well is not the axe and adze.\n\nPainting imitates form, so substance precedes ornament; speech conveys feeling, so truth precedes eloquence. Without substance, ornament is not form; without truth, eloquence is not feeling. Rouge and kohl adorn the face to enhance beauty, yet few turn their gaze; intricate melodies on the strings strive for sorrow, yet few are moved—this is because the substance is not beautiful. Where substance is not beautiful, even lavish adornment lacks splendor; where melody is not harmonious, even swift rhythms lack pathos.\n\nPrinciple stirs the heart and appears in the countenance; emotion arises within and takes shape in sound. Thus, forced fear may smile but knows no joy; forced weeping may seem mournful but feels no sorrow. To hear what one loathes is worse than not hearing; to see what one loathes is worse than not seeing. Therefore, one covers one’s ears at thunder and shields one’s eyes from lightning.\n\nTo practice benevolence is not profitable; to pursue profit is not benevolent. Thus, grain merchants desire famine, and apothecaries desire illness. Each values what it serves, and Jie and Zhou’s dogs may bark at Yao. Thus, thieves and brigands may scorn Confucius as base, though they surpass other thieves and brigands.\n\nWhen fortune declines, one blames Heaven; when humiliation comes, one resents others. Thus, one blames the inventor of fire when burned, or curses Boyi when drowning in a well. Without planting kindness in advance, one bestows favors in crisis; without guarding against beginnings, one cultivates caution after harm is done—like digging a well when thirsty or planting a tree when hungry, though swift, it comes too late.\n\nGongyi loved fish (Gongyi was a Chu man who craved fish); Qu Dao loved water caltrop (though not the finest flavor, all found it sweet, for it was shared by all). King Wen savored gall, Zeng Shen relished dates—bitter and sour, yet the two found them sweet, for they differed from the crowd.\n\nThe deer resembles the horse yet outruns it; the dhole resembles the dog yet surpasses it in strength. A state may have a thousand-gold horse but no thousand-gold deer; a household may have a thousand-gold dog but no thousand-gold dhole—because dogs and horses are useful, while dholes and deer are not.\n\n**The Nine Schools (Fifty-Five):**\n\n**Daoists**—such as Lao Dan, Guan Yin, Pang Juan, and Zhuang Zhou—take emptiness as their root, purity as their heart, humility as their virtue, and weakness as their conduct. They dwell in non-action, teach without words, shape the cosmos without appearing near, and nurture the ten thousand things without claiming merit. Yet their shallow followers wholly abandon loyalty and filial piety, sever benevolence and righteousness, and rely solely on emptiness, seeking governance thereby.\n\n**Confucians**—such as Yan Ying, Zisi, Meng Ke, and Xun Qing—follow the nature of yin and yang, clarify the roots of education, roam the Six Arts, and cherish the Five Constants. They favor elaborate burials and ornate robes, value music and accept fate, trace their lineage to Yao and Shun, model themselves on Wen and Wu, and revere Confucius as their master to exalt his Way. Yet their shallow followers expand texts endlessly, making them difficult to exhaust.\n\n**Yin-Yang School**—such as Zi Wei, Zou Yan, Sang Qiu, and Nan Gong—revere and follow august Heaven, chart the sun, moon, and stars, respectfully grant the people their seasons, model the three luminaries’ measures, follow the four seasons’ movements, know the five phases’ natures, and comprehend the eight winds’ qi to enrich the people and order governance. Yet their shallow followers are bound by taboos and drowned in divination.\n\n**Logicians**—such as Song Keng (a Qin scholar, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*), Yin Wen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long—rectify names, for if names are not rectified, speech is not smooth. Thus, they define hierarchy, correct names and duties, value equality and frugality, and forbid attack and cease warfare. They crafted the Huashan cap to symbolize balanced governance, and their lenient doctrines demonstrate distinctions. Yet their shallow followers abandon fundamentals for trivialities, dissecting and debating with mere rhetorical flourishes.\n\n**Legalists**—such as Shen Dao, Li Li, Han Fei, and Shang Yang—rely on clear punishments, organize troops and refine laws, entice the good and punish the wicked, ensuring compliance with standards to establish governance. Yet their shallow followers pare away benevolence and discard righteousness, relying solely on penal law, making customs harsh and lacking in kindness.\n\n**Mohists**—such as Yin Yi, Mo Di, Qin Gua, and Hu Pai—practice frugality, humility, and esteem for the worthy; honor ghosts, reject fate, advocate simple burials and plain garments, and oppose unjust warfare. Yet their shallow followers’ Way is too austere, their frugality too hard to follow.\n\n**Diplomats**—such as Quezi (named Ziwo, a Qi man skilled in warfare), Pang Nuan, Su Qin, and Zhang Yi—base their art on practicing benevolence, interpreting two states’ sentiments, alleviating the scourge of war, accepting commands but not words, adapting to circumstances to seize opportunities, rescuing danger and righting imbalance, turning misfortune into fortune. Yet their shallow followers merely indulge in cunning rhetoric and abandon loyalty and trust.\n\n**Eclectics**—such as Kong Jia, Wei Liao, Shi Qiao, and Huai Yi—illuminate yin and yang, root themselves in the Dao and virtue, blend Confucianism and Mohism, merge Logicians and Legalists, embrace Diplomacy, and incorporate Agriculture. They draw from all categories, unbound by a single thread. Yet their shallow followers produce overgrown, tangled doctrines with no guiding principle.\n\n**Agriculturalists**—such as Shen Nong, Ye Lao, Zai Shi, and Fan Shengzhi—base their way on farming, expanding cultivation, sowing and planting the hundred grains. When the state’s granaries are full and households have surplus stores, ritual and propriety naturally arise. Yet their shallow followers would have kings and commoners plow side by side in the fields, erasing distinctions of rank and disrupting the order between ruler and subject.\n\nSurveying the teachings of these nine schools, though they vary in depth and their words in detail, diverging in form and branching into separate paths, they all share the same profound principle and converge in the Dao of governance. Though their traces differ, their ultimate aim is the same—just as the five phases overcome one another yet also engender one another, the four seasons oppose yet together complete the year, the waters of the Zi and Mian rivers rise from different sources but flow into the same sea, the notes gong and shang differ in sound yet harmonize in music, Yi Yin and Hui Shi followed distinct paths yet were equally esteemed as worthy, and the two masters pursued different conduct yet were equally deemed humane.\n\nThe **Daoists** take mysterious transformation as their foundation, while the **Confucians** take virtue and education as their guiding principle. Among the nine streams, these two teachings are supreme. The Dao transforms the world through non-action, while Confucianism aids the customs through the Six Arts. Non-action takes clarity and emptiness as its heart, while the Six Arts take ritual and music as their instruction. If Confucian teachings were applied in a world of Great Unity, deceit and falsehood would sprout; if non-action were imposed upon the age of Cheng and Kang, chaos and strife would arise. Why? Because the purity or turbidity of the times differs, so too must the transformative influence adapt; past and present diverge, so governance and education should vary accordingly.\n\nFrom this perspective, though Confucian teaching does not attain the ultimate truth, it can guide the world; though Daoist thought fully grasps human nature, its disregard for ritual cannot remedy corruption. Thus, the worthy in governing the age should prioritize ritual education, while recluses seeking refuge in seclusion should devote themselves to non-action. In this way, both their pursuits will flourish, and their persons and reputations will be preserved intact.\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Ten, concludes.*",

      "translated_text": "**Yuan Xiaozheng’s Annotations to *Liuzi* (Record of Bozhou)**\n**1. *Qingshen* (Purifying the Spirit)**\n\nThe body is the vessel of life. The heart is the root of the body. The spirit is the treasure of the heart. Thus, when the spirit is tranquil, the heart is harmonious. When the heart is still, it does not weary the body.\n\nTo inquire into stillness without disturbing one’s nature and emotions is to depart from dust and distance oneself from filth. Thus, when the heavens are clear, the white sun shines; when the river is clear, the sage emerges. When the times are clear, there is great peace; when the waters are clear, the fish leap. When the spirit is clear, there are no burdens; when the heart is clear, the shadow is straight.\n\nThe spirit is the name of profound wisdom. Clarity is the designation of purity. If one can purify the body, then filth will not stain it. If one can still the heart and spirit, the body will suffer no harm. Thus, Confucius said of Boyi and Shuqi that they could be called pure.\n\nWhen the heart is harmonious, the body is whole. When the spirit is restless, the heart is unsettled; when the heart is unsettled, the body is harmed. To preserve the body, one must first order the spirit. Thus, nurturing the spirit with tranquility brings inner peace; dwelling in emptiness and clarity keeps one undisturbed by externals. When the spirit is tranquil and the heart clear, the body is free from burdens.\n\nThe empty room generates brightness—auspiciousness arrives. If the human heart inwardly generates brightness without turbidity, then auspiciousness arrives. Gazing upon that which is not hollow: the empty room generates brightness. If the human heart is empty, then pure brightness arises alone.\n\nSima Biao said: *Que* means emptiness, cessation. People do not reflect in dull metal but in a polished mirror because the polished can illuminate. They do not gaze upon flowing waves but upon still water because stillness can clarify. Mirrors and water, by their nature of clarity, can thus reflect the forms of things.\n\nFrom this, we see: when the spirit is luminous, filth vanishes; when the body is still, the spirit is clear. When filth vanishes, inner desires are forever extinguished; when the spirit is clear, external burdens do not enter.\n\nNow, when a pure song is performed, the heart rejoices. Han E was skilled in singing. Traveling to Qi, she sang as she walked. Arriving at Yongmen, a great snowstorm fell, and her provisions ran out. She wished to sing for food, but the people of Yongmen did not recognize her and struck her with a staff. Han E then wept in sorrow, and those who heard her weeping all grieved and went three days without eating. A wise person said to her: \"You are skilled in singing—you may cease weeping and sing.\" Han E then sang, her voice so clear and resonant it could stir the rafters’ dust. The people of Yongmen, upon hearing it, forgot their meals for three days.\n\nWhen sorrowful sounds arise, the heart is grieved. The spirit dwells in the body, shifting with encounters and influences. From this, we see that the changes of emotion arise from without. If a single sorrow or joy can obstruct the true nature, how much more can the myriad things, with their power to seize and agitate the heart and spirit?\n\nThus, when ten thousand men draw their bows toward one magpie, can the magpie avoid being struck? The magpie is a bird of ill omen, so all aim their arrows at it—a metaphor for the human heart’s myriad distractions, emotions in chaos, the heart unsettled, like the magpie struck by an arrow.\n\nThe myriad things dazzle and confuse, deluding this one life—can life avoid injury? The seven apertures are the doors and windows of the spirit and essence. Will and qi are the envoys and sentinels of the five viscera. The ears and eyes are enticed by sounds and sights; the nose and mouth by fragrances and flavors; the limbs and body by comfort and ease. Their emotions are one, and thus the spirit gallops wildly without restraint. When will and qi are worn down by pursuit and abandonment, the five viscera surge and are not at peace.\n\nDesires extend endlessly without, while the heart’s palace is congested within. Spreading through the waves of excess and dissipation, lingering in the realm of right and wrong—those who do not corrupt their virtue or harm their lives are indeed few.\n\nThus, the sage clears the eyes and does not see, stills the ears and does not hear, closes the mouth and does not speak, abandons the heart and does not ponder. They value the body and forget lowliness, so power and rank cannot move them. In the past, Yao offered the throne to Xu You, who refused and washed his ears in the river. They delight in the Dao and forget poverty, so great wealth cannot sway them. They dwell in contentment, roam in accord with their nature, their qi vast and unobstructed, their innermost being purely bright. Thus, the body is not cultivated, yet nature is preserved; the heart is not wearied, yet the Dao arrives of itself.\n\n**2. *Fangyu* (Guarding Against Desire)**\n\nIn receiving qi, humans necessarily possess emotions and nature. What nature is moved by is emotion. What emotion finds peace in is desire. Desire is the source of esteem and love, the root of extravagance and excess.\n\nThus, Jie of Xia and Xin of Shang perished through desire; Qing Feng and Zhi Bo ruined their houses through desire. All stemmed from failing to guard against the subtle and consider the distant, accumulating small matters into great ones.\n\nThe *Six Secret Teachings* of the Grand Duke says: \"If two leaves are not removed, they will seek the axe’s handle. If a tiny flame is not extinguished, how will one deal with a raging blaze?\" This speaks of not eliminating the small, leading to great disaster.\n\nEmotion arises from nature, yet emotion violates nature. Desire arises from emotion, yet desire harms emotion. Emotion injures nature, nature obstructs emotion—like smoke and waves to water and fire. Smoke is born from fire, yet smoke stifles fire; ice comes from water, yet ice blocks water. Thus, when smoke is faint, fire blazes; when ice floats, water flows. When nature is steadfast, emotion fades; when emotion burns fiercely, nature is destroyed.\n\nThus, when a pearl is lustrous, dust cannot cling to it. When nature is bright, emotions and desires cannot stain it. The nature of the forest is still—what moves it is the wind’s shaking. The nature of water is clear—what muddies it is the soil’s turbidity. The nature of humans is steadfast—what leads them astray is desire’s dazzlement.\n\nThe body’s possession of desire is like a tree’s possession of sapwood. When a tree embraces sapwood, it returns to self-destruction; when the body embraces desire, it returns to self-harm. Thus, when sapwood flourishes, the tree breaks; when desire blazes, the body perishes.\n\nTo restrain emotions and desires, first gather in the five gates. The five gates are the paths of emotions and desires, the storehouses of preferences. The eyes love vibrant colors—called the axe that hews nature. The ears delight in lewd sounds—called the drum that attacks the heart. The mouth craves rich flavors—called the medicine that rots the intestines. Fatty meat and fine wine are the medicine that rots the intestines.",

The body luxuriates in carriages and horses—called the mechanism that invites distress.\n\nShu Guang said: \"The poor and lowly constantly long for wealth and nobility, yet wealth and nobility tread upon the precipice of peril.\" Thus, he hung his official cap outside the Eastern Gate of Luoyang, resigned his post, and returned home in old age, with a thousand officials seeing him off. Yu Xin said: \"A thousand officials bid farewell to the Two Shus.\" The Two Shus were the brothers Shu Guang and Shu Shou. Hence it is said: \"The Two Shus perceived the danger, who compelled them to untie their seals?\" The *Book* states: \"Dwelling in favor, think of peril—none fail to stand in awe.\"\n\nThese five are what nourish life, yet also what harm it. The ears and eyes in their relation to sounds and sights, the nose and mouth in their relation to fragrances and flavors, the flesh and limbs in their relation to ease and comfort—all share the same nature. Yet by them one may die, or by them one may live; one may become wise and virtuous, or one may remain foolish and dull—all depends on how one handles them.\n\nIt is like the fool who tends fish and crows: seeing the cold of winter, he places the fish in warm broth and perches the crows upon a firewood pyre. Water and wood are what nourish fish and crows, yet nurturing them contrary to principle will surely lead to their withering and decay. Colors, sounds, fragrances, and flavors are what delight people, yet delighting in them beyond measure will return to harm life.\n\nThus, the wise dissect their emotions to cast off encumbrances, restrain their desires to preserve their endowment, eat enough to fill the void and sustain qi, wear enough to cover the body and ward off cold.

      "translated_text": "Desires assail the heart, and true nature is overturned. The great harm of desires is an internal affliction of the heart—far greater than the harm to finger or skin. Yet while the harm of external afflictions is lighter than an autumn hair, people know to avoid it; the harm of internal afflictions is heavier than Mount Tai, yet none avoid it. Is this not forsaking a light suffering to bear a heavy one? Is it not perverse?\n\nWhen a man’s oxen or horses wander astray, he knows to retrieve them; yet when his passions and desires run wild, he does not know to rein them in. Is this not delusion? To restrain passions and desires, one must act at their most fragile and subtle. The sprouting of desire is like a tree’s first shoot, like a flame’s first flicker—one may pluck it and break it, extinguish it with a drop of dew. But once it blazes, branches coil into the clouds, flames roar like the towering Chapter Hua.\n\n*Fiao* means fire soaring in flight; *shan* means fire raging. In Chu stood the Chapter Hua Terrace, vast and towering. The King of Chu, fond of valor, set fire to the terrace and ordered his soldiers to extinguish it, promising rewards equal to the spoils of Chen. Thus the soldiers, their bodies smeared with mud, rushed into the flames to save it. Hence it is said: flames *shan-piao* the Chapter Hua Terrace. Though they exhausted their strength wielding axes and drained the ponds to drown the fire, they could not suppress it—so fierce was its power.\n\nWhen desires first stir, the ears and eyes may be sealed and the heart and mind locked; but once they blaze, though one folds away passions and rolls up desires, one cannot contain them—so ruined is one’s nature. If one could block the apertures before desires take shape—\n\n*Dui* means the eyes. Laozi said: \"Block the apertures, close the gates.\" Do not see the allure of desire.\n\n—if one could forbid desires at their most fragile and subtle, though one might seek regret and remorse, could it be attained?\n\n**Abandoning Passions, III**\nPassions are the arbiter of right and wrong, the root of benefit and harm. Passions are the root of benefit and harm, the arbiter of right and wrong. Without passions, things present no doubt; with passions, responses become obstacles. Thus one must abandon them.\n\nWhere there is right, there must be wrong; what can benefit can also harm. Right and wrong, benefit and harm dwell within, and each turns to doubt the other. Therefore, to engage the world without passions is to meet all things with constant harmony; to engage others with passions is to encounter obstacles at every turn. From this we see: where passions reside, things become doubtful.\n\nThus, when a matchmaker praises a man—*Meiyang* was a matchmaker of unknown era—the praised does not take it as virtue. One who forces himself to eat and is thus sated does not take it as kindness. An infant who harms another is not resented by the harmed. A dwarf who mocks another is not shamed by the mocked. Why? Because the matchmaker seeks advantage for himself, and the praised, moved by the benefit of praise, though receiving kindness does not deem it virtue. Without passions toward harm or shame, though slandered, one bears no grudge.\n\nFish do not fear the net but fear the *hong*—the *ti*, the cormorant, also called the *huwu*, a marsh bird. The mighty do not resent the *Suo’ou* and *Moye*—names of famous swords—but resent the one who wields them. The net has no intent, but the bird has passions; the sword has no passions, but the man has intent.\n\nTo have an honest man divide wealth is not as fair as casting lots or drawing straws. When a man divides property, the property moves his feet. To have an incorruptible man guard a treasure is not as secure as sealing it behind locked doors. Why?

The heart may be like a balance scale—a balance scale being the steelyard. Yet when one judges another’s beauty or ugliness, even if the words hit the mark, the other will surely resent it. But when one gazes into a bright mirror and sees their own reflection reversed, their ugliness exposed, they may feel shame inwardly yet bear no grudge.

Those who parade their uniqueness and flaunt their talents never escape harm to their nature and destruction of their fate. All things in the world delight in adorning themselves with splendor and displaying their finest traits, yet none who reveal their talents avoid injury to their nature.\n\nThus, the kingfisher’s brilliant plumage brings self-destruction—its feathers, vibrant in emerald and azure, prized for ornament, are seized by humankind. The tortoise’s wisdom invites its own ruin—when the sacred tortoise bears the prophetic diagram, people bore and scorch its shell to divine fortune. Cinnabar, for its rich hue, is ground away; jade-bearing stone is shattered for its treasure. These four beings, though born in remote wilds, far removed from humankind, entrust their nature to mountain forests and lodge their spirits beyond the world of things, seeking nothing from others. Yet they bring misfortune upon themselves by failing to conceal their form.\n\nHad the kingfisher withdrawn its wings into the luminous groves of the southern fire-mountains—nine myriad *li* from the Central Kingdom, the phoenix’s domain—it would have forever escaped the peril of plucked feathers. Had the tortoise dragged its tail through the mud of Yang Valley—the valley of the rising sun, where, as the *Book of Documents* says, \"the sun emerges from Yang Valley and illumines all under heaven\"—it would never have known the sorrow of scorching. Had cinnabar hidden its glow in the depths of Spring Mountain—a branch of Jing Mountain, rich in jade and vermilion—its grinding would have ceased forever. Had the stone held fast to the crags of the Dark Garden, the anguish of carving would never have reached it.\n\nThus, the towering catalpa of secluded peaks and winding gorges, born amidst piled boulders, its tip piercing the azure sky, its roots delving into the Yellow Springs, its branches spreading wide, its leaves curling in fantastical whorls—beneath it, unicorns and *lin* beasts frolic; above it, cranes and *luan* birds soar; floating clouds nestle beside it; the pure wind stirs through it. Year after year, it suffers not the slightest harm from axes or blades. Not that it possesses anything coveted by humankind, but that it conceals its essence, thus preserving its nature.\n\nThe elm by the roadside, however—its branches gathered by woodcutters, its boughs felled by carpenters, its last handspan of shoots snapped by passersby—possesses nothing extraordinary. Yet it invites plunder because its form remains exposed. The Zhou rooster, by severing its own tail—when King Wen of Zhou sought to sacrifice a cock with plumage of perfect hue, the bird bit off its tail, rendering it unfit for the altar, and thus escaped death—shows that even cleverness may court disaster.\n\nThe mountain ape, for all its cunning—this nimble creature, skilled at dodging arrows—once, when the King of Chu went hunting, performed tricks in the trees. The king asked his attendants, \"Who is the finest archer?\" They replied, \"Only Yang Youji excels.\" The king summoned Youji, who arrived, adjusted his bowstring, and nocked an arrow. The ape, clinging to the tree, wailed, knowing Youji’s divine aim left no escape; death was certain. From this, the principle of withdrawal and emergence may be understood.\n\nThus, the virtuous of old concealed their traces and veiled their wisdom to seal their exterior, stilled their hearts and sealed their emotions to settle their interior. With the interior settled, the spirit’s storehouse remains undisturbed; with the exterior sealed, the body remains unassailed. Dwelling thus, is one not whole?\n\n**Chapter Five: Exalting Study**\nThe supreme Dao is wordless; without speech, its principles cannot be made clear. The Great Image is formless; without form, its mysteries cannot be fathomed. The subtleties of Dao and Image cannot be conveyed without words. The subtleties of words cannot be transmitted without study. Never has one discerned the Dao without study, nor illuminated the self without its aid.\n\nSilkworms spin their cocoons into thread, woven into fine silk, stitched into garments—kings and lords wear them. Study refines conduct and adorns speech with literary grace, and the world honors it. Without spinning, raw silk rots in baskets; without study, talent and wisdom fester in the heart.\n\nUnopened, the oyster’s bright pearl remains hidden; uncut, the Kun bamboo’s phoenix-like tones remain unheard—when the Yellow Emperor sent Ling Lun to the western valleys of Kunlun Mountain to gather bamboo for pitch-pipes, the bamboo, golden as metal, when blown, produced a sound indistinguishable from the phoenix’s cry. Thus, the phoenix’s voice goes unheard. Unrefined, the spirit’s radiance does not emerge.\n\nConsider metal and wood: metal’s nature harbors water; wood’s nature conceals fire. Smelt metal, and water appears; drill wood, and fire is born. If one devotes oneself to study, drilling and refining one’s nature, talent and wisdom will flourish.\n\nIndigo, drawn from the blue plant, surpasses it in depth; dyeing makes it so. Ice, born of water, surpasses it in clarity; cold makes it so. The mirror, wrought from metal, surpasses it in brightness; polishing makes it so. The children of the Rong and Yi tribes cry alike at birth, yet grow to speak different tongues; teaching makes it so. The Rong dwell in the west, the Yi in the east, their languages distinct. Yet in infancy, their wails are indistinguishable. Only as they mature do their tongues diverge—education and learning make it so.\n\nMountains cradle jade, and grasses and trees flourish; rivers harbor pearls, and their banks never wither. The mouth takes in flavors, and the hundred joints grow robust; the heart receives classics and admonitions, and the five natures flow freely. Without ascending lofty peaks, one does not know the height of heaven; without gazing into deep valleys, one does not know the depth of earth; without traversing the Six Arts, one does not know the source of wisdom.\n\nWhat is distant yet gleams with splendor is adornment; what is near yet grows ever clearer is study. Thus, the stalwart bamboo of Wu—though straight and firm, fit for arrows—without fletching and arrowheads, lacks beauty. The keen blade of Yue—though sharp—without tempering, lacks penetration.",

      "translated_text": "Ji Zi was a prince of Wu, skilled in distinguishing musical tones and discerning through music whether a state would endure or perish. *Qingjiao* is a woodwind tone, a sound of harmony and nurturance. When this tone is present in music, the state enjoys peace; if absent, the state will fall. Ji Zi, entering a foreign land to listen for this tone in its music, focused his mind entirely upon his ears, neglecting his eyes—thus he could not perceive the forms of Mount Song or Mount Tai.\n\nSight does not pertain to hearing, nor do the ears see; the eyes govern vision, and the ears cannot see. When the mind is wholly fixed upon the eyes, it forgets the ears, and hearing fails. Why then does hearing not pertain to sight, nor do the eyes hear? The ears govern hearing, and the eyes cannot hear. When the mind is wholly fixed upon the ears, it forgets the eyes, and sight fails—this is because the mind cannot serve two purposes at once. When the mind is submerged in the tip of an autumn hair or absorbed in the *qingjiao* melody, this is the reason.\n\nLi Lou, when applying his mind, neglected his ears; when using his ears, he neglected his mind. To be \"submerged in mind\" is to be engrossed in seeing and hearing. Thus, when the mind is fixed upon the eyes, it must forget the ears, and hearing fails; when the mind is fixed upon the ears, it must neglect the eyes, and sight fails.\n\nIf one attempts to draw a square with the left hand and a circle with the right, commanding both to be completed at once—though the mind wields the compass and square, and the hands trace their forms (a *duo* is a square knife, like today’s carving tool; a *jue* is a round knife, like today’s curved engraving blade, resembling a compass. The compass draws circles, the square draws squares)—though the hands hold the tools of square and circle, they cannot execute both at once. Some say *Jurang* was a swift runner of the Yellow Emperor’s time, commonly called *Jurang Lüji*. Yet he could not do so because the mind cannot serve two purposes, and thus the hands cannot move in tandem.\n\nYi Qiu was the finest player of *yi* in the land. Yi Qiu was the name of an ancient master of the game; because of his skill in *bo* and *yi*, he took *yi* as his surname. When absorbed in thought during a game, if someone passed by playing the *sheng*, he would momentarily listen—and thus lose the game. This was not because his grasp of *yi* was shallow, but because his attention was divided, and the *sheng* disrupted it. *Hua* means to confuse or deceive.\n\nLi Shou was the finest calculator in the world. When a wild swan flew past, he bent his bow to aim, and in the moment between drawing and releasing, if asked to multiply three by five, he could not answer. This was not because three times five was difficult to calculate, but because his mind was obscured, and the swan disrupted it.\n\nYi Qiu’s *yi* and Li Shou’s calculations could plumb the subtlest depths and exhaust all numbers without error. Yet when their minds were on the *sheng* or the swan, they lost the game—this is because the mind was not single-minded but wandered to external affairs.\n\nThe blind have no eyes, yet their ears cannot perceive with precision, for they are wholly devoted to hearing. The turtle has no ears, yet its eyes can \"hear\" through sight, for it is wholly devoted to seeing. Though the blind and the turtle are small creatures, their hearing and sight are keen—this is because they apply their minds with singular focus.\n\nThe cicada is difficult to catch, yet one may seize it as swiftly as a knife’s slash. *Duo* means swift.

      "translated_text": "The *juan’er* is easy to gather, yet it does not fill even a shallow basket—this is the difference between single-mindedness and distraction. The queen consort sighed, saying, \"If only I could find a noble man to govern the state together.\" Yet she forgot the rites of sacrifice in her preoccupation—here too, the distinction between focus and distraction is evident. Thus, the learner must devote themselves with diligence and single-mindedness to enter the realm of the numinous. If the mind is not engaged in study yet one forces recitation, though the words enter the ear, they do not settle in the heart. It is like a deaf man singing, mimicking others without true joy—though the sound leaves his mouth, it scatters and dissipates.\n\n*End of Scroll One of Liuzi*\n*Scroll Two of Liuzi*\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Registrar of Bozhou*\n\n**On Music, Chapter Seven**\n\nMusic is the voice of Heaven and Earth, the principle of harmony and balance. It consists of the five notes, their rhythms alternating between slow and swift, requiring the attainment of a harmonious sound. It is something human nature cannot do without. When the human heart rejoices, it smiles; when it smiles, it delights; when it delights, the mouth longs to sing. Joy gives rise to song and dance. In song, one chants the lyrics and spreads them through sound; in dance, one moves the body and follows the melody. The singer harmonizes with the instruments, though the lyrics vary in number, and the music adapts to the changing verses—hence the term \"song lyrics,\" now also called \"elegant songs.\" The hands long to play, the feet to dance. Song and dance manifest in sound and form: one listens to the song’s melody and observes the dance’s movements. Form arises from motion and stillness, entering the supreme Dao. Sound and stillness, the transformations of human nature, find their fullest expression here.\n\nThus, humans cannot be without music, and music cannot be without form; form cannot be without the Dao, and the Dao cannot be without disorder. The former kings despised such disorder. Master Kuang, through repeated singing, knew that the *Southern Wind* would not prevail; Ji Zha, by listening to music, foresaw the imminent fall of the state of Chen. By examining the tones of *gong* and *shang* and scrutinizing the pitch, once the five notes were established and ceased, they did not allow the hands to grow restless, lest wanton sounds arise and disrupt the proper tones. The former kings, loathing such disorder, created elegant music to guide the people. When a piece concluded, if the hands grew restless and did not stop, wanton sounds emerged. Proper tones constituted elegant music; restless hands and chaotic sounds became wanton music. Wanton music is the sound of a fallen state and a disordered age. Thus, they created elegant music to guide the people, ensuring its sound was sufficient for joy yet not excessive; its melody was orderly yet not deceptive. (Deceptive means false.)\n\nThe former kings established music with defined limits. Thus, music has the five notes, with tempos ranging from slow to swift, progressing from beginning to end, their rhythms alternating to achieve a harmonious sound. Once the piece concluded, they ceased. When the five notes were complete and harmony achieved, they withdrew, refusing to play further and produce wanton sounds. Hence it is said: if the five notes do not cease, it is not proper sound; if the hands grow restless without end, discordant sounds arise. Discordant sounds are those of Zheng and Wei—these are the sounds of a fallen state and a disordered age. Thus, it is said: let the sound be harmonious, the melody orderly yet not deceptive; let the piece be intricate yet refined and balanced.\n\nThe early Confucians said: \"Intricate\" means excessive; \"refined\" means concise; \"balanced\" means restrained. Music has wanton music and elegant music. Those who create it must discern and recognize them, ensuring the melody is orderly yet not deceptive, the musical sounds coherent and structured, arranged without deceit. If the sounds are overly intricate, they must be reduced. They should be made concise, balanced, and even, for music moves the human heart toward good or evil, distinguishes the noble from the base, establishes hierarchy, transforms human nature, and shifts customs. Each dance has its own prescribed movements. Thus, when dance is referred to as \"pattern,\" it is not called \"dance\" outright. This is how music influences human goodness or wickedness, preventing the heart from straying into depravity—such was the intent of the former kings in establishing music.\n\nThe Five Emperors ruled in different eras and did not inherit one another’s music. The former kings danced *Cloud Gate* to worship Heaven, *Xianchi* to sacrifice to Earth, *Shao* to honor the Four Directions, *Great Xia* to venerate the mountains and rivers, *Great Huo* to offer to the ancestral mothers, and *Great Martial* to present to the ancestors. The Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Emperor Ku, Yao, and Shun—these are the Five Emperors. The Three Kings lived in different ages and did not follow one another’s rites. Xia, Yin, and Zhou—these are the later Three Kings. Each modeled their achievements and virtues, adapting to the changes of their times.\n\nThus, the Yellow Emperor’s music was called *Cloud Gate*—it signified his sagely virtue emerging like clouds from a gate. Zhuanxu’s was called *Five Stalks*—his virtue extended to all things, possessing roots and stems. Emperor Ku’s was called *Six Blossoms*—his virtue embraced all things, bearing their finest essence. Yao’s was called *Xianchi*—*xian* means \"all,\" *chi* means \"to spread,\" signifying his sagely virtue pervading the world. Shun’s was called *Shao*—*xiao* means \"reverent,\" indicating his moral character was solemn and respectful. *Shao* also means \"to continue,\" signifying Shun’s ability to inherit Yao’s great merits. The *Book of Documents* states: \"When the *Shao* was played nine times, the phoenix came in response.\" The above refers to the Five Emperors.\n\nYu’s music was called *Great Xia*—*xia* means \"great,\" signifying Yu’s ability to expand upon the virtues of Yao and Shun, his virtue as vast as the heavens, his toil for the people beyond measure, like a great hall’s roof sheltering the people. Tang’s was called *Great Huo*—his virtue was vast, saving the common people and eradicating tyranny; he also protected and nurtured them, spreading his care across the world. Thus, it was called *Great Huo*. King Wu’s was called *Great Martial*—he pacified the world through martial prowess, hence his music was named *Great Martial*.

In Lu, songs were performed in the hall while dances took place in the courtyard; the music bells preceded the song, which then led to the dance. First came the recitation of the poems, followed by the various musical pieces. When dances were held in the hall, they were called songs—such was the nature of their dance melodies.\n\nThis was not merely to delight the heart or sate the ears with their resonant tones, but to align with the forms of Heaven and Earth, to fulfill the natures of the myriad things, to harmonize the emotions of the twelve pitch-pipes, and to regulate the qi of yin and yang. The twelve pitch-pipes correspond to the twelve months, blending the rhythms of the eight winds. The five degrees of sound all harmonize with the winds of the eight directions, balancing the production of the eight tones. Each has its rhythm and constant measure; the notes they preserve have their proper divisions, each maintaining its proper order.\n\nThey connect the divisions of the Nine Songs—music has nine performances, beginning with the metal instruments. \"Metal\" refers to bells and chimes. When the people of Jin performed music, they first sang the *Sìxià* as the opening, then struck the metal instruments, followed by the song of King Wen’s music. The nine performances are the Nine *Xià*. The Nine *Xià* are the names of melodies: *Wángxià*, *Zhāoxià*, *Nàxià*, *Zhāngxià*, *Qíxià*, *Zúxià*, *Jīngxià*, *Shǎnxià*, and *Sìxià*. When the king departs, *Wángxià* is played. When armies meet, *Sìxià* is played. When sacrificial animals are led out, *Zhāoxià* is played. When guests arrive from the four directions, *Nàxià* is played. When ministers render merit, *Zhāngxià* is played. When the lady assists in the sacrifice, *Qíxià* is played. When clansmen attend and serve, *Zúxià* is played. When the duke departs, *Jīngxià* is played. When intoxicated guests depart, *Shǎnxià* is played.

      "translated_text": "Degenerate sounds are excessive. Man is yang; woman is yin. As woman ever follows man, she becomes a thing of the yang household. It is said that when one indulges in sensory pleasures, qi may exceed its proper measure—yin in excess chills yang, while excess itself generates heat through the woman’s yang nature. Thus it is said that heat gives rise to six kinds of illness. This affliction is like *gu* poison: the mind and will grow disordered, consciousness fades, and one’s nature is lost. It is called *gu* illness, causing a person to drown in feminine allure, losing their ordinary nature—just as one who sinks into water is said to drown. To be entangled in desire is likewise akin to drowning. Hence excess and drowning are spoken of together.\n\nThus, in the time of Xia Jie, the \"Song of the Shattered Axe\" was composed. When Xia Jie ruled, the Son of Heaven made the \"Song of the Shattered Axe,\" which laments: \"Alas! All lives are lost!\" This marked the beginning of eastern sounds. Eastern sounds belong to the wood phase of the east, governed by the *jue* tone. The *jue* tone is harmonious and nurturing, a sound that cultivates nature and fosters growth.\n\nKing Zhou of Yin composed the decadent *mimi* music. King Zhou was the tyrant Zhou Xin. *Mimi* was the name of a song for endless nights—this was the designation of the wanton music of the Jie and Zhou dynasties, marking the beginning of northern sounds. Northern sounds were the licentious music of King Zhou.\n\nThe customs of Zheng and Wei favored excess, giving rise to songs like \"Qin and Wei\" and \"Sangzhong.\" The Qin and Wei were two rivers between the states of Zheng and Wei. *Sangzhong* was a place of royal debauchery; the king’s depravity influenced the people, leading men and women of the two states to meet in wild unions in the fields. As the *Book of Songs* says: \"Await me in Sangzhong, summon me at Shangguan, escort me to the banks of the Qi.\"\n\nThe customs of Chu and Yue favored valor, giving rise to songs of leaping into boiling water and treading upon fire. The King of Chu loved courage: he set fire to the Ganquan Palace and ordered his soldiers to extinguish the flames as if in battle, rewarding the successful and punishing the failures. The soldiers, their bodies smeared with mud, rushed to fight the fire, and over three thousand perished in the flames.\n\nEach sings of what they cherish, lamenting what they desire to do.

      "translated_text": "This is sorrow without grief, yet those who hear it weep. For what the heart feels manifests in sound, and what sound stirs must flow into the heart. Thus, when the heart is moved by sorrow or joy, the tones of *qiao* and *sha*, *bi* and *huan* arise, and the melodies of the Pu River emerge. When King Zhou of Shang acted without the Dao, his court musician embraced his zither and cast himself into the Pu River to die. A musician of Wei named Shi Juan passed by the Pu River and heard music upon its waters. He listened and transcribed it, and upon reaching Jin, he composed this piece. The Jin court musician Shi Kuang said to the king: \"This is the music of the Pu River—music of a fallen state.\" Thereafter, it was abandoned and never played again. Such sounds give rise to licentious, reckless, and dissolute impulses.\n\nThus, when Yan Nian composed the song of the city-toppling beauty, Emperor Wu of Han longed for languid, seductive charm. *Miman* refers to bewitching allure. Yan Nian was Li Yan Nian, a man of striking beauty. Emperor Wu took him as a consort and appointed him Commandant of Harmonizing Pitch. The emperor ordered him to create new music, and so Yan Nian rose to dance and sang:\n*\"In the southern lands there is a fair one,\nWhose beauty is like jade.\nOne glance topples a city,\nA second glance topples a kingdom.\nIf a kingdom’s fall is no regret,\nSuch a beauty cannot be found again.\"*\nThe emperor doted on him and asked his attendants: \"Is there another beauty in the world like this?\" They replied: \"Yan Nian has a younger sister, peerless in grace and unmatched in beauty.\" The emperor summoned her at once, and finding her incomparably lovely, took her as his lady. The people of the time said: \"One male, one female, a pair flying into the purple palace.\"\n\nWhen Yongmen played the tune of the pines, Duke Min of Qi mourned his unfinished mourning robes. Yongmen was a musician of Qi who played for the duke the melody *\"Autumn Wind Enters the Pine Bridge,\"* its notes piercingly mournful. As he played, the duke shivered, thinking of the robes he had yet to complete.\n\nWhen Jing Ke entered Qin, Song Yi struck the *zhu* and sang by the Yi River. Jing Ke, a man of Wei, went to Qin with Prince Dan of Yan to avenge him, intending to assassinate the King of Qin. As he departed at the Yi River, the prince saw him off. Song Yi played the *zhu*, and Jing Ke drew his sword and sang:\n*\"The wind howls, the Yi River runs cold,\nA hero departs, never to return.\"*\nThe song moved heaven, and a white rainbow pierced the sun. Though he failed to kill the King of Qin and perished in the Qin palace, he never returned. Those who heard it glared in fury, their hair bristling through their caps.\n\nWhen King Qian of Zhao was exiled to Fangling—King Wu, son of King Ling, banished for his crimes to the land of Fangling—his heart longed for his homeland. He composed the *\"Mountain and Water Hinge,\"* singing as he sat by day and chanting as he walked by night. His song went:\n*\"The mountain has trees,\nThe trees have branches.\nMy heart longs for you, my lord—\nDoes my lord know?\"*\nThose who heard it choked with sobs, their tears flowing unchecked.\n\nAll these are sounds of dissipation, sorrow, indignation, and bitter lament—music not of reason, harmony, or virtuous power. When Emperor Huan of Han heard the zither of Chu, he sighed with deep emotion, his heart aching with sorrow. The *zither of Chu* was a melody filled with the plaintive songs of Chu women. As Emperor Huan listened, he was overcome by its mournful, desolate tones. He said: \"How excellent! If music can be like this, is it not joy?\" But music should be sound that harmonizes the heart, not this. Now the sound is sorrowful, the heart grieving, tears flowing as songs are offered—this is taking sorrow as joy. If sorrow is taken as joy, what joy remains?\n\nToday, resentful and mournful sounds are set to pipes and strings. Those who hear them are either led astray or plunged into grief. To be led astray is to confuse the distinction between men and women; to grieve is to be moved by sounds of resentment. How can this be called music? Thus, depraved sounds stir people, and perverse *qi* responds; perverse *qi* takes form, and licentious music arises. Upright sounds stir people, and harmonious *qi* responds; harmonious *qi* takes form, and balanced music arises. If music is not harmonious, *qi* becomes stagnant; when *qi* stagnates, hearts grow perverse, deceitful, and false, giving rise to reckless and wanton deeds.\n\nTherefore, depraved sounds and seductive sights do not linger in the wise; lewd sounds and corrupt rites do not touch the heart’s cultivation. Only the essence of refined music brings harmony to the heart without disorder.\n\nThus, odes and hymns express the will, bells and drums regulate the ear, feathers and banners govern the eye. Those who listen do not incline toward excess; those who watch do not stray into depravity. When ears and eyes are not inclined or led astray, perverse sounds cannot enter; when perverse sounds do not enter, the nature and emotions harmonize within; when nature and emotions harmonize within, only then is there true music.\n\n**Chapter Eight: Treading Faithfully**\nFaith is the foundation of conduct; conduct is the root of a person. Without faith, a person cannot stand. Thus it is said: \"Abandon food, but preserve faith.\" The *Analects* says: \"If a person lacks faith, I do not know how they can be of use.\" A person cannot be complete without conduct; conduct cannot stand without faith. Thus, faith in a person is like a boat needed to cross a river; faith in conduct is like the oar needed to row the boat. To cross a great river, how can one do without a boat? To sail a square vessel, how can one do without an oar? Now, though one may wish to do good, without knowing how to establish conduct, it is like crossing a river without a boat. Though one may wish to establish conduct, without knowing how to establish faith, it is like rowing a boat without an oar. This is like one who sets out for Ying but heads toward Mount Ming—Ying lies in the south, Mount Ming in the north—turning away from the path, ever more distant.\n\nSince ancient times, all must die, but without faith, a person cannot stand. Thus, even the *pig and fish* are reached by faith. The *pig and fish* refer to the *Zhong Fu* hexagram in the *Book of Changes*, which governs faith. When this hexagram appears in divination, promises are kept, and hunts yield their quarry. Thus, it is the master of faith. How true this is!",

      "translated_text": "Faith is the foundation of all speech. Duke Huan of Qi did not betray the covenant at Cao Ju; Duke Wen of Jin did not abandon his oath to besiege Yuan. When Duke Wen of Jin led his troops to attack the Yuan clan, he ordered each soldier to carry three days’ rations, vowing to retreat once the provisions were exhausted. After encircling the city of Yuan for three days, the defenders still refused to surrender. Duke Wen prepared to withdraw, but a deserter from the city reported: “The city’s supplies are exhausted; they will surrender by dawn. You may remain to accept their surrender.” Duke Wen replied: “I made a pact with my soldiers to retreat when the rations were gone. If I do not withdraw now, I break my word. To gain a city at the cost of faith is not what I will do.” He then ordered the army to return. Upon hearing this, the people of Yuan surrendered of their own accord. From then on, the feudal lords submitted to Jin, all because of the faith shown in the siege of Yuan.\n\nWu Qi did not renege on his reward for moving the axle. Wu Qi, a general of Wei, wished to attack Qin but feared his soldiers lacked trust in him. He buried a chariot axle at the eastern gate of the market and posted a notice: “Whoever can move this axle to the western gate will be granted a hundred *mu* of land, a hundred *jin* of gold, and a house.” For three days, no one dared to move it. Wu Qi then amended the notice: “Whoever moves it will receive five hundred *mu* of land, five hundred *jin* of gold, and a house.” A man came forward and moved the axle, and Wu Qi rewarded him as promised. Later, when he summoned his troops to attack Qin, they achieved victory. This is what it means to not break one’s promise for moving the axle.\n\nMarquis Wen of Wei did not break his appointment with the forester. The forester was the official in charge of mountains and marshes. Marquis Wen had arranged to go hunting with him the next day. On the appointed morning, a heavy rain fell, and his attendants urged him to cancel. The marquis said: “I am not so eager for game that I would break my word to the forester.” He then braved the rain to keep the appointment. Through such conduct, his virtue shone across the heavens and earth, and his name flowed through past and present without blemish.\n\nThus, in spring, the wind must be true—if the wind is unfaithful, flowers and buds will not flourish, and the virtue of generation will fail. In summer, the heat must be true—if the heat is unfaithful, plants and trees will not grow, and the virtue of growth will fail. In autumn, the rain must be true—if the rain is unfaithful, the hundred grains will not ripen, and the virtue of harvest will fail. In winter, the cold must be true—if the cold is unfaithful, water and earth will not solidify, and the virtue of tranquility will fail. If even the numinous powers of heaven and earth, when the seasons are unfaithful, suffer the collapse of the four virtues, how much more so for man?\n\nLong ago, when Qi attacked Lu, it demanded the *Cen* tripod. The Lord of Lu falsely offered another tripod and proposed an alliance. The Lord of Qi, distrustful, sent Liu Ji to verify its authenticity, for Liu Ji was a man of unshakable faith in Lu. Lu then dispatched Liu Ji. Liu Ji said: “You regard the tripod as the foundation of your state, but faith is the foundation of my state. If I destroy my state’s foundation to preserve yours, it is a task I cannot undertake.” He then presented the true *Cen* tripod.\n\nWhen the minor state of She sought refuge in Lu, Lu sent Zilu to negotiate, demanding that She’s lord swear no oath. Zilu declined. Jisun said to him: “A state of a thousand chariots distrusts its own oath but trusts your single word—why do you refuse?” Zilu replied: “If they do not act as vassals yet expect me to guarantee their word, it is unrighteous. I cannot do it.”\n\nLiu Ji and Zilu were mere commoners of Lu, yet their faith stood firm at the crossroads, and their reputations resounded throughout the world. Thus, Qi and She did not trust the oaths of thousand-chariot states but revered the words of these two men. How great is the virtue of faith!\n\nDuke Xiao of Qin sent Shang Yang to attack Wei. Wei dispatched Prince Ang to intercept and resist him. Shang Yang said to Prince Ang: “In the past, you and I were friends. Now, as leaders of two states, I cannot bear to attack you. Let us share a drink to rest our armies.” Prince Ang agreed, and they met. Shang Yang had hidden soldiers ambush and capture him, then crushed Wei’s army. When King Hui later ascended the throne, he suspected Shang Yang of deceit and had him torn apart by chariots in the marketplace. Shang Yang was a pillar minister of Qin, his name esteemed throughout the realm, yet he coveted the petty gain of treachery and lost the great principle of sincerity. Once faithless, he was reproached for life, ultimately meeting destruction and becoming a laughingstock for all under heaven. Is not the harm of faithlessness grave?\n\nThus, words must match deeds—this is the seal of faith. When words are the same but faith precedes them, faith lies before speech; when teachings are the same but sincerity lies beyond them, sincerity exists outside words. The noble person knows the value of sincerity and faith, and thus acts with unwavering trust. In command and movement, in stillness and action, he does not lose the seal of his word. Through this, his teachings stand firm, his governance is upright, his far-reaching influence gathers others, and his rewards and punishments are clear. From this, we see that faith as conduct is of great virtue.\n\n**Thought and Compliance, Ninth**\n\nThe seven luminaries align in order to illuminate the celestial patterns; the celestial patterns show the five stars like strung pearls and the sun and moon like joined jade disks. The five natures follow principle to perfect human conduct. Conduct is beautiful when it embodies compliance, for beauty lies in compliance. When man errs, his error lies in defiance. Thus, if the seven luminaries defy their course, the celestial patterns change; if the five natures defy principle, the human Dao collapses. That such changes do not bring disaster, or such collapse does not harm conduct, has never been known.\n\nWhen mountains and seas contend for water, the water must flow to the sea—not because the sea seeks it, but because the current is compliant. The *Qian* hexagram indicates advantage in the southeast. *Qian* is a hexagram in the *Book of Changes*: Kan above, Gen below, called *Jian*. Gen is mountain, Kan is water. Water upon a mountain is unstable, hence it is called *Qian*. The southeast is the terrain—its nature is low, while the northwest is high. Water naturally flows downward, following the terrain, and thus complies. If one divines and obtains this hexagram, it is auspicious to travel southeast. Therefore, compliance means not acting against the current. Settling on land is compliance; traveling northeast is defiance, for climbing mountains is contrary. Thus, avoiding dampness and seeking dryness is the nature of fire.",

Thus, even the *pig and fish* are reached by faith. The *pig and fish* refer to the *Zhong Fu* hexagram in the *Book of Changes*, which governs faith. When this hexagram appears in divination, promises are kept, and hunts yield their quarry. Thus, it is the master of faith. How true this is!",

      "translated_text": "Avoiding heights and following low ground is the nature of water. If one guides a spring toward a ravine, it becomes an easily descending flow; if one forces waves to surge against mountains, it must become a difficult ascent. Though water is without sentiment, it still knows to shun opposition and seek compliance—how much more should the human heart? Thus, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are the compliance of virtue; defiance, arrogance, and rudeness are the opposition of virtue. Compliance is the gate of blessing; opposition is the repository of misfortune. From this, one may clearly recognize the difficulty of opposing nature and the ease of following it.\n\nConsider Meng Shuo, a mighty warrior of King Zhou’s time, who pulled an ox by its tail: the tail snapped, the knees split, and he could not advance ten paces. Yet if one threads a mulberry branch through the ox’s nose, smooths it with a length of silk, and lets a bareheaded boy ride and prod it, the beast may gallop across vast marshes, free to go wherever it pleases. Why? Ten paces are no farther than the broad marsh, and the bareheaded boy is no mightier than Meng Shuo—yet the near cannot match the far, the strong cannot surpass the weak, for one is opposition and the other compliance.\n\nSima Ji amassed all the world’s attacks as a swordsman. If one grasps the sword by its blade and brandishes its edge, one must sever one’s fingers and yet fail to pierce rotten wood or dent iron armor. But if one grips the hilt and wields the blade, even an ordinary man may cleave rhinoceroses and elephants on land, or sever dragons in water. Acting in accord with principle is like grasping the hilt; acting against one’s nature is like grasping the blade—can one hope to avoid injuring one’s hand?\n\nThough Hou Ji excelled at sowing and planting, he could not make crops grow in winter, for that opposes the seasons. Though Yu excelled at controlling floods, he drilled through mountains and tunnels, yet rivers could not be made to flow westward, for that opposes the terrain. Though one’s talents and skills may be outstanding, one cannot act contrary to reason and succeed, for that opposes the human Way. Thus, following principle and abiding by nature, even a fool may establish a name; pursuing what is contrary to the Dao, even the wise and sagely will encounter misfortune.\n\nIf a noble person can practice loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, tread sincerity, and contemplate compliance, Heaven will aid them with good fortune, and nothing will be inauspicious.\n\n**Vigilance in Solitude (Chapter Ten)**\n\nGoodness is the sum of conduct and cannot be departed from even for a moment. If it can be departed from, it is not true goodness. A person’s need for goodness is like the head’s need for a cap or the feet’s need for shoes. A head without a cap is uncouth; walking without shoes is barbaric. If one cultivates goodness when in the open but commits wrongs in secret, it is like donning cap and shoes at dawn but going barefoot and bareheaded by dusk.\n\nThe fragrant *acorus* does not cease its fragrance because it grows alone in rocky seclusion; the hidden spring does not lose its clarity because it flows in a secluded ravine. How can a person, in darkness and obscurity, alter their conduct because no one sees? Thus, one must be vigilant where the eye does not see and fearful where the ear does not hear. At home, one should act as if in the presence of guests; in an empty room, as if someone were there.\n\nThe lotus does not change its nature when night falls—this illustrates how the hundred kings upheld ritual without alteration. Lian Huan rode in a carriage at night, and when passing the gate of the Lord of Wei, he dismounted, bowed to the gate, and proceeded. The Lord of Wei, hearing this from within, rode to the gate but did not hear the sound of the carriage. He said, “This must be Lian Huan.” Yan Hui did not alter his demeanor even when bathing at night. When Goujian was imprisoned in the stone chamber, he and his minister maintained the rites of lord and subject without change. When Ji Que plowed in the wilds, he and his wife did not neglect their mutual respect. (Ji Que was a farmer of Jin; beyond the suburbs is the outskirts, beyond the outskirts is the wilds, beyond the wilds is the forest, and beyond the forest is the open country. When Ji Que plowed in the open country and his wife brought him food, he treated her with the courtesy due a guest, without lapse.)\n\nAll these exemplify vigilance in solitude. They abided in goodness even in hidden and subtle circumstances, not altering their hearts because no one saw or changing their disposition because no one heard. Heaven may be high, yet its hearing is near; the sun may be distant, yet its light is close; the divine may be obscure, yet its scrutiny is clear.\n\nAs the *Book of Songs* says:\n*Though you are in your chamber, do not act as if unseen in the hidden corner.*\n(The northwest corner is called the \"hidden corner.\")\n*Do not say, \"It is not manifest,\" for nothing escapes my gaze.*\n\nDark and obscure deeds are never truly hidden; confused and deluded actions are never truly concealed. If one cultivates integrity in the open but acts perversely in secret, thinking no one knows—if people do not know, the spirits do; if the spirits do not know, one knows oneself. To claim ignorance is the folly of the bell thief covering his ears.\n\nConfucius’s disciple rose early each morning to diligently practice goodness. Dongping, in his chamber, took delight in goodness. (Dongping was named Cang.) When asked, “What brings you joy?” he replied, “I take joy in goodness.” Thus, if one constantly abides in goodness, inwardly there is no anxiety, outwardly no fear; one stands alone without shame before one’s shadow, sleeps alone without guilt before the lamp. Above, one may commune with the divine; below, one may solidify human relationships. Virtue pervades the hidden and the manifest, and blessings and auspiciousness will gather.\n\n*End of Scroll Two of the Liuzi*\n*(Collated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Record Keeper and Editorial Assistant of Bozhou)*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Eleven: Honoring Agriculture**\n\nClothing and food are the foundation of the people. The people are the foundation of the state. The people rely on clothing and food as fish rely on water; the state relies on its people as a person relies on their feet. Without water, fish cannot live; without feet, a person cannot walk; without its people, a state cannot be governed. The former kings, understanding this, ensured the people had clothing and food.\n\nThus, when the agricultural omen appears at dawn in the first month, and the celestial signs gather at the corners of the earth—agriculture being the term for plowing and sowing—this is the auspicious month of the first lunar dawn. As yang qi surges and the veins of earth and trees stir, the Son of Heaven personally plows in the eastern suburbs on the first *hai* day. The queen and consorts personally tend silkworms in the northern suburbs on the first *si* day. Though the state has no lack of skilled farmers, the ruler plows himself; though the world has no shortage of silkworm maidens, the queen and consorts tend silkworms themselves. Above, this provides for the ancestral temples; below, it encourages the myriad people.\n\nThe laws of Shennong state: If a man in his prime does not plow, someone in the world will suffer hunger. If a woman in her youth does not weave, someone in the world will suffer cold. Therefore, the Son of Heaven plows himself, and the queen and consorts weave themselves, setting the example for all under heaven. Thus, those who do not exert themselves in plowing will have nothing to sustain life; those who do not labor in weaving will have nothing to cover their bodies. When clothing and food are abundant, wickedness does not arise; with peace and no strife, the world is harmonious. The wise have no schemes to employ, and the brave have no might to display.\n\nThus, clothing and food are the people’s foundation, while craftsmanship is secondary. Carved patterns and intricate engravings harm farming; embroidered silks and elaborate sashes disrupt women’s work. If farming is harmed, hunger follows; if women’s work is disrupted, cold ensues. When hunger and cold arrive together, to forbid theft is like fanning flames to prevent burning or stirring water to seek stillness—it cannot be done. When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame; when granaries are full, people understand ritual and propriety.\n\nTherefore, those who establish states must prioritize the substance of fields and silkworms over the splendor of beauty, valuing grain and silk as treasures and regarding pearls and jade as dung. Why? Pearls and jade are but empty playthings, while grain and silk have practical use. Even if all the world’s tiles and pebbles turned to fine jade, and all sand and stone became luminous pearls, in years of flood or drought, when famine strikes, jade cannot ward off cold, nor can pearls fill hunger. Though one may possess a mirror that outshines the sun or a gem that rivals the moon, they are of no use—no different from painting a portrait of Xi Shi, beautiful yet unable to bring joy, or carving peaches and plums, lifelike yet inedible.\n\nClothing and food are the means by which people live, and of these, food is the most urgent. Frost and snow may pile high, but thatch cannot replace furs—*ku* being thatch, meaning without cloth or silk, one can only wear thatch or *meng* (women’s garments; in the Jiangdong region, thatch is also called *gai*). When a household is as empty as a hanging chime, grass and wood cannot serve as grain. Thus, the former kings established nine years’ worth of reserves in their states to prepare for emergencies and relieve disasters.\n\nIn the times of Yao and Tang, there were ten years’ worth of stores. When the nine-year flood and seven-year drought struck, no one heard of famine or starvation, nor of bodies abandoned in ditches—all because of abundant reserves. The reason grain is not stored is that too many live by wandering trades while too few till the soil.\n\nThe *ming* insect emerges in autumn and dies in autumn—*ming* eats the heart of seedlings, *teng* eats the joints, *shi* eats the roots, and *zei* eats the leaves. These four pests are all calamities for people. A single season of infestation leads to years of food shortages. Now, if one person plows while a hundred consume, the harm is far greater than that of the *ming* insect.",

      "translated_text": "Thus did the former kings reverently bestow the seasons upon the people, exhorting and instructing them in agriculture and sericulture, reducing those who lived by wandering trades, and lessening the burdens of corvée labor. Then granaries stood full, and songs of praise arose. Though war-horses might muster or floods and droughts strike, the state never knew anxiety, nor the people harm.\n\n**Cherishing the People (Chapter Twelve)**\nHeaven engendered the teeming people and set a ruler over them. The ruler is the people’s heaven. Heaven nurtures all things, with yin and yang as its great principles; the ruler transforms the people, with governance and instruction as his duty. Thus, when cold and heat come unseasonably, epidemics arise; when wind and rain are untimely, the year suffers famine. Punishments are the people’s cold and heat; teachings and commands are their wind and rain. If punishments are untimely, the people are harmed; if teachings and commands lack moderation, customs decay. Therefore, in muddied waters no fish flicks its tail; in parched earth no tree stands firm; under oppressive governance no people enjoy ease. Governance toward the people is like a zither or lute: if the great strings are strung too tight, the small strings snap, and when the small strings snap, the great strings fall silent. When the feet are cold, the heart suffers; when the people toil, the state is harmed. When the feet are warm, the heart is at peace; when the people rest, the state is secure.\n\nThus, those who govern well must take benevolence and love as their foundation, not harshness and cruelty as their priority. They pardon punishments to preserve lives, reduce corvée and taxes to rest the people’s strength, lighten levies so as not to exhaust their wealth, and refrain from encroaching on farming seasons to ensure sufficiency. Then households will be provided for, the state will be prosperous, and great peace may be achieved.\n\nThe people’s relationship to their ruler is like a child’s to its parents. Never have parents been rich while their children were poor, nor parents poor while their children were rich. Thus, when the people abound, it is not only their own abundance but the state’s; when they suffer want, it is not only their own want but the state’s. As the saying goes: “When the hundred clans are sufficient, with whom is the ruler not sufficient? When the hundred clans are insufficient, with whom is the ruler sufficient?” This is the meaning.\n\nIn the governance of the former kings, above they followed the seasons of heaven, below they nurtured the myriad things. Grass and trees, birds and insects did not lose their place. Before otters had offered fish in sacrifice, nets were not cast; before jackals had offered beasts, hunting was not undertaken; before hawks had struck their prey, snares were not set; before frost and dew had settled, grass and trees were not felled. Grass and trees have life but no awareness; birds and beasts have awareness but no understanding—yet benevolence and love were extended even to them. How much more should they be extended to people?\n\nThus, when a ruler’s benevolence is like spring and his grace like rain, his virtue moistening the myriad things, the people will die for him. In former times, King Tai dwelt in Bin—King Tai, that is, Gugong Danfu, the fifteenth-generation descendant of Hou Ji. Practicing benevolence and love toward the people, in one year a market formed, in two years a town, in three years a city. That it came to be so was because his benevolence and love overflowed. The people followed him, for his benevolence and love overflowed.\n\nThe lord of Fusha—Fusha being a state—lacked sufficient benevolence and love, and the people forsook him, coming to join Shun. Some say that when Shun attacked Fusha, its people abandoned their lord and came to him. It is unclear which came first, but the people turned from him because his benevolence and love were insufficient. Benevolence and love bind people more firmly than metal or stone; metal and stone may melt, but people cannot be parted.\n\nThus, the ruler is the soil, the people the plants. Never has rich soil failed to nourish lush plants; never has a benevolent ruler failed to foster a flourishing people.\n\n**Following Transformation (Chapter Thirteen)**\nThe ruler takes the people as his body; the people take the ruler as their heart. What the heart desires, the body must embrace; what the ruler desires, the people must follow. Never has the heart desired something without the body obeying, nor the ruler wished for something without the people complying.\n\nThe people’s following of their ruler is like grass bending to the wind, like water conforming to its vessel. Thus, the ruler’s virtue is the wind and the vessel; the people’s nature is the grass and the water. Grass sways with the wind: when the wind races east, it bends east; when the wind races west, it bends west—so it follows the wind’s direction. Water in a vessel takes its shape: if the vessel is square, the water is square; if the vessel is round, the water is round—so it follows the vessel’s form.\n\nThose below serve those above, following their conduct, like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound—no word is false. What those above favor, those below will favor even more. As the *Odes* says: “Inducing people is most easy,” for they follow their superiors.\n\nIn former times, Duke Huan of Qi favored purple clothing, and throughout his realm all wore strange hues. Duke Wen of Jin disliked lambskin robes, and all his ministers wore zang-sheep pelts—zang-sheep being old sheep, or ewe skins. Duke Ai of Lu favored Confucian garb, and the whole state donned Confucian robes. King Wuling of Zhao favored *juemao* caps, and all in his land wore *jun* caps. Purple is not a proper color, *xiang* not a fine virtue, Confucian robes not common attire, *jue* not an ornament for caps—yet all competed in these because they followed their ruler’s preferences.\n\nKing Ling of Chu favored slender waists, and his ministers and concubines starved themselves, many dying of hunger. King Goujian of Yue favored courage and bowed to fighting frogs—when leading his troops to destroy Wu, he saw a frog in the road, puffing itself up as if to resist his chariot wheels. The king descended and bowed to it, whereupon his warriors all emulated him, and he went on to destroy Wu. This showed the power of brave men’s strength. The people of his state treated life lightly, and many died in battle.\n\nLife is what people value most; death is what they detest most. Yet now they treat what they value lightly and what they detest heavily—why? Because they follow their ruler’s preferences.\n\nThe people of Yao and Shun could be enfeoffed by the household; the people of Jie and Zhou could be executed by the rooftop. It was not that the people of Yao and Shun were all inherently benevolent and righteous, nor that the people of Jie and Zhou were born wicked and perverse. The difference in good and evil arose from the transforming influence of their rulers.",

      "translated_text": "Thus the enlightened ruler is cautious in his preferences, using them to rectify the customs of the age; he establishes a moral influence that flows into later generations. Yet it may be that those below do not necessarily follow their ruler’s preferences, and people do not necessarily align with him.\n\nFor instance, in the age of Tang Yao, the Four Fiends ran rampant; in the time of Yin Zhou, the Three Loyalists remained steadfast; under Han Wen, though he practiced frugality, the common people were extravagant; and in Qi Jing’s reign of excess, Yan Ying alone was thrifty. These are claims that fail to grasp the truth.\n\nWhy? Winter’s virtue is yin, yet there are the frigid flames of Xiaoqiu—where fire naturally arises in the Xiaoqiu mountains, igniting in spring and extinguishing in autumn. This mound spans a thousand *li*, with flames kindling at its center. Summer’s virtue is yang, yet frost and sleet may fall. (Sleet is a mix of rain and snow.) If even the virtue of Heaven and Earth cannot be uniform in yin and yang, how can the worthy and sagely expect to unify the myriad people?\n\nThus, though the steelyard may be true, it cannot avoid the slightest deviation; though the scale may be level, it cannot escape the smallest discrepancy. To extend the analogy: when Tang Yao ruled above, the realm was well-ordered, yet the Four Fiends alone caused chaos—still, we say Yao governed well, for order was the norm. When Yin Zhou ruled above, the realm was in turmoil, yet the Three Loyalists alone remained upright—still, we say Zhou ruled poorly, for chaos was widespread. Though Han Wen was frugal, some people were extravagant—still, we say the age was thrifty, for frugality prevailed. Though Qi Jing was excessively lavish, Yan Ying alone practiced thrift—still, we say the state was extravagant, for excess was the norm.\n\nWater’s nature should be cool, yet there are the warm springs of Huayang (Huayang, a southern region in Liang, where hot springs emerge)—still, we say water is cool, for coolness is the norm.",

      "translated_text": "Fire’s nature should be hot, yet there are the cold flames of Xiaoqiu—still, we say fire is hot, for heat is the norm. Swift winds stir waves, high and low stand in contrast; mountains rise and valleys sink, their differences measured in fathoms. Yet when viewed from afar, we still say water is level—this is to grasp the greater principle. Thus, in judging worldly affairs, one always takes the majority as the standard.\n\nNow, those who speak must attend to the intent beyond their words, lest they cling to the letter and harm the meaning.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: Safeguarding the Dao**\n\nMethods and laws are what the ruler holds, the pivot and mechanism of governance. Methods reside within, adapting to tasks and responding to change; laws are established without, suiting the times to guide people. When people follow the Dao yet remain unaware of its calculations, this is method. When teachings are displayed and commands issued to instruct others, this is law.\n\nThe ruler who safeguards the world with transformation is like heaven transforming the myriad things with qi. Qi transforms the myriad things yet leaves no visible trace; method transforms people yet leaves no visible form. Thus, heaven’s numinosity lies in qi, while the ruler’s divinity lies in method. Method achieves wonder through hidden subtlety; law excels through clear judgment.\n\nWhen the pure wind turns shallow, people grow contentious; once deceit and falsehood arise, laws are established to restrain them. *Restrain* here means to correct. Commands and teachings are set forth to show people the correct standard.\n\nThose who found states and rule others, though capable of good governance, have never abandoned law to achieve order. Thus, Shennong ruled without punishments, yet the people were good—yet those who govern cannot discard law to rule others. Shun wielded shield and battle-axe to subdue the Youmiao; the Miao people would not submit to Shun, but when he danced with shield and axe between the two steps, the Miao submitted of their own accord. *The Book of Documents* states: \"After seventy days, the Miao came to submit.\" Those who wage war cannot lay down their armor to control bandits.\n\nEstablishing laws is like skilled charioteering: one assesses the horse’s strength, estimates the road’s distance, aligns the bit and reins, and follows the momentum. Thus one can ascend slopes and charge into peril without overturning, like a carriage on difficult terrain yet free from collapse. One can traverse danger and cover great distances without straying from the track.\n\nThe ruler is like the charioteer; law is like the reins; the people are like the horse; the horse is like the track; governance is like holding the reins. The reinsman desires the horse to follow the track; the enlightened law desires people to follow order. If the reins are uneven, the horse strays from the track; if the law is unsuited to the times, people deviate from principle.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened ruler strives to follow the law and adapt to the times. If it benefits the people, one need not imitate antiquity; if it harms affairs, one cannot cling to the old. The decline of Xia and Shang came from not changing their laws; the rise of the Three Dynasties came from not copying one another, yet each achieved kingship. Yao and Shun followed different paths yet their virtue covered the world; Tang and Wu governed differently yet their names endured for generations. From this, we see that laws should change—no single era suffices.\n\nYet today, those who uphold the law are drowned in ancient statutes, while Confucians are bound by old rites, failing to recognize that as circumstances shift, laws must adapt. Such men may be entrusted with enforcing the law to teach, but not with debating the law to establish teaching.\n\nThus, the wise create laws, while fools are constrained by them; the worthy reform rites, while the unworthy cling to them. Those bound by law are unfit to discuss affairs; those who merely regulate law are unfit to debate principle.\n\nTo grasp the laws of one age and impose them on people of a hundred generations is like using one garment to ward off cold and heat, or one medicine to treat all sores. To carry the rites of one time and use them to instruct endless customs is like marking the boat to seek the sword—when a man of Song crossed the river and lost his sword, he carved a mark on the boat, waiting to reach the other shore before searching—or like guarding the stump to wait for the hare: a hunter once startled a hare that dashed into a stump and died. A passerby found it and stayed all day, guarding the stump in hopes of another hare to kill.\n\nThus, those who establish laws are the source of rites, but not the means of governance. Rites are the ancestral standard of accomplished transformation, but not the means by which transformation is achieved. The ancestral standard of transformation lies in following the times; the foundation of governance lies in adapting to the world. Never has there been one who, failing to adapt to the world, desired order, or, failing to follow the times, achieved transformation. To govern by such means is not to forget.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Rewards and Punishments**\n\nIn governing the people and guiding subordinates, nothing is more correct than law; in establishing laws and teaching, nothing is greater than rewards and punishments. Rewards and punishments are the state’s sharp instruments, the handles by which people are controlled.\n\nThus, heaven completes the year through the movements of the gnomon—one circuit of the heavens spans 365¼ degrees. The sun and moon each follow their own measured paths: the sun moves slowly, completing one circuit in a year; the moon moves swiftly, completing one circuit in a month. The state achieves order through law and teaching.\n\nWhen the gnomon moves in heaven, the seasons take shape on earth; when the law stirs above, order takes shape among the people. The gnomon’s movement begins with spring and ends with autumn; the law’s movement begins with rewards and ends with punishments.\n\nThus, the warm winds of spring stir the sprouts and blossoms; the cold dew of autumn fells the lush leaves. Clear rewards for the virtuous encourage good people; conspicuous punishments for the guilty deter the wicked below.\n\nThose skilled in reward follow what the people love to encourage goodness; those skilled in punishment follow what the people hate to suppress wickedness. Thus, small rewards encourage goodness, and light punishments quell wickedness. Reward one person, and the world rejoices; punish one person, and the world stands in awe. Thus one can teach narrowly yet govern broadly, achieve much with little.\n\nThis is like Wang Liang’s skill in charioteering: he knew the horse’s hunger and fullness, gauged the rhythm of speed and restraint, and so, without relying on the whip, could promise a thousand *li*. Yet the whip cannot be entirely abandoned, for horses may grow unruly.\n\nThe sage’s governance uses ranks and rewards to encourage goodness, and benevolence to nurture the people, so that punishments are unused and great peace is attained. Yet punishments cannot be abolished, for the people may grow unrestrained.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, while rewards encourage goodness, punishments cannot be absent; while punishments suppress wickedness, rewards cannot be absent. When rewards are impartial and punishments are just, the principles of governance are established. Therefore, the ruler is the arbiter of rewards and punishments, guiding people toward goodness. Their benefits are weighty, and their authority is great. Even a small, dangled reward suffices to encourage goodness; even a light, implied threat suffices to deter wickedness. Why, then, should one spread lavish rewards to bait subordinates or wield overwhelming power to overawe the people?\n\nThus, a single reward must not lack credibility, nor a single punishment lack clarity. If rewards are given but not trusted, they fail to encourage; if punishments are meted out but not understood, they fail to deter. When encouragement and deterrence both fail, good and evil lose their proper order. Therefore, the enlightened ruler rewards goodness and punishes wickedness not for personal gain, but for the sake of the state. Those who please the ruler but bring no benefit to the state receive no reward; those who defy the ruler but benefit the state incur no punishment. Punishments must be applied only to those at fault, and rewards must be bestowed only on those who have rendered service. If rewards are trustworthy and punishments are clear, then the people will follow as surely as a boat glides along a river or a cart rolls along a road—wherever they turn, they will succeed; whatever path they take, they will reach their destination.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Examining Names**\n\nWords convey principles, and principles are the foundation of words; names verify reality, and reality is the source of names. Without words, principles cannot be clarified; without names, reality cannot be distinguished. If principles are elucidated by words yet the words themselves are unprincipled, or if reality is discerned by names yet the names do not reflect reality, then trusting words while abandoning principles does not yield true understanding, nor does trusting names while neglecting reality.\n\nThus, the wise scrutinize words to uncover principles, without losing sight of principles in favor of mere rhetoric; they hold fast to names to demand reality, without discarding reality to preserve empty labels. In this way, words and principles are both thoroughly understood, and names and reality are both correctly aligned.\n\nYet when the world transmits words, it often magnifies small truths into great falsehoods, turning wrong into right. The wider the transmission, the more distorted the principles; the more names proliferate, the more reality is inverted—until a dog is mistaken for a man, and white is turned into black.\n\nIf one points to a dog and calls it a man, or claims white is black, the resemblance is absurd. Yet by such twisted analogies, one thing is likened to another: a dog is said to resemble a *jué* (a mythical beast), a *jué* resembles a macaque, and a macaque resembles a man—thus, a dog resembles a man. White is said to resemble *xiāng* (light yellow), *xiāng* resembles yellow, yellow resembles vermilion, vermilion resembles purple, purple resembles *qián* (a bluish-black), and *qián* resembles black—thus, white becomes black.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s four faces were not truly eight-eyed; he governed the realm by dispatching lords to the four directions, which later became exaggerated into four faces. *Kuí*’s single foot was not literally one-legged; as the *Lüshi Chunqiu* records, when Duke Ai asked Confucius whether *Kuí* truly had only one foot, Confucius replied, \"To tune the six pitch-pipes and harmonize the eight tones, one man suffices.\" Yet later generations took this to mean *Kuí* had but a single foot. The *Zhuangzi* states: \"*Kuí*’s one foot\" refers to his halting gait.\n\nThe jade uncut from Zhou was in fact a dead rat; the people of Zhou prized unworked jade, and when a swindler wrapped a dead rat in multicolored silk and sold it as jade, they placed it in a treasure casket, believing it genuine. Bian He heard of this and borrowed it to examine, only to laugh and declare it a dead rat. The owner, ashamed, discarded both the rat and the casket.\n\nThe phoenix of Chu was merely a pheasant; when a man of Chu obtained a pheasant with five-colored plumage, he mistook it for a phoenix and sought to present it to his lord. Midway, he saw many such birds in the fields and asked what they were. Told they were pheasants, he turned back in shame.\n\nThe Wise Old Man of Foolish Valley was deemed a fool; a worthy man who secluded himself in Foolish Valley called himself \"Foolish Old Man,\" and the people, hearing this, took him for a true fool—until they later learned he was a man of wisdom.\n\nThe Yellow Elder’s beautiful daughter was branded ugly; the Yellow Elder had a daughter of thirty who remained unmarried, her bearing and beauty unmatched. When asked about her, he modestly replied, \"My daughter is too ugly to marry.\" People took her for truly ugly—until she was taken as a consort, and they saw her beauty.\n\nThe man of Lu in flowing robes was no true Confucian; the \"flowing robes\" were wide-sleeved garments worn by scholars of the arts, distinct from the attire of commoners. When Duke Ai saw Confucius dressed differently from the nobles and the people, he suspected it was Confucian garb and inquired about it.\n\nDongguo playing the *gan* knew nothing of music; the *gan* resembled a sheng, with thirty-six pipes. King Xuan of Qi loved to hear it played, and three thousand musicians at his court could perform it. Those who could play received stipends, and Dongguo, a scholar, falsely claimed to be among them, holding a *gan* to his lips to demand payment. When King Xuan died and King Cheng ascended, the musicians were tested one by one, and Dongguo, exposed as a fraud, fled and never reappeared.\n\nFour faces and one foot were never real; uncut jade and phoenixes were not what they were named; the man of Lu and Dongguo bore empty titles of praise; the Wise Old Man of Foolish Valley and the Yellow Elder suffered undeserved infamy. From this, we see how hearsay loses truth, how names and reality are inverted, how beauty and ugliness lack fixed labels, and how worthiness and foolishness lack true measure. The corruption of custom lies in failing to examine names and reality, blindly trusting hearsay, and mistaking semblance for truth.",

The \"Riverbank Maiden\" is called a \"woman,\" but the *ni* maiden is the name of a medicinal herb, the same as today’s *fandai*. People, not examining its name, call it a woman. \"Yao’s Brew\" and \"Yu’s Provisions\" are called food and drink, yet these too are names of medicinal substances. Yao’s Brew is the sap of a tree, while Yu’s Provisions are the reddest earth found in red soil—when Yu governed the floods and provisions ran scarce, he ate this earth, hence the name. People, not examining its name, say it is today’s food and drink. \"Dragon Liver\" and \"Ox Knee\" are called meat, yet both are names of medicinal herbs. People, not examining them, take them for the flesh of dragons and oxen.\n\nWhen a well was dug and a man was \"obtained,\" it was said a man emerged from the earth. In Song, a family dug a well and declared, \"Our household dug a well and gained the benefit of one man.\" People, not understanding, said a man had emerged from the earth, and all repeated it. The lord of the state heard and summoned them to ask. The man of Song replied, \"When my household dug the well, we lived far from water and had to send one person daily to draw it. Since digging the well, we have saved one person’s labor each day. I said digging the well was like gaining one man—it was not that a man emerged from beneath the earth.\"\n\n\"Three pigs crossed the river\" was said to mean they swam atop the water. A man of Lu, reading the *Records of the Historian*, misread the characters and said, \"Three pigs crossed the river.\" Someone asked, \"What does it mean?\" The man of Lu replied, \"They swam atop the water.\" Zixia heard and went to look, then said, \"The Lord of Jin crossed the river on the day *jihai*. The scribe who wrote the record mistakenly wrote *san* ‘three’ for *ji* ‘self’ and *shi* ‘pig’ for *hai* ‘the twelfth earthly branch.’\" The man of Lu did not believe him and went to Jin to ask. The Lord of Jin had indeed crossed the river on the day *jihai*, and only then did he realize the characters had truly been miswritten.\n\nSuch cases are beyond counting. Thus, the fox and the leopard cat, two creatures, are joined by their names—the fox is a wild dog, the leopard cat a wild feline—yet merged into one.

      "translated_text": "Thus, the ancients were always cautious in transmitting names, closely examining their terms while distantly drawing from principle, lest names harm reality. When reality is concealed by names, names cannot harbor falsehood, nor can reality be obscured in its truth. This is called \"rectifying names.\"\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Three ends*\n*Liuzi, Scroll Four begins*\n*Commentary by Yuan Xiaozheng, Registrar of Bozhou*\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: Vulgar Names**\n\nNames are the forms of what is designated; words are the names of what is designated. Forms may be skillful or clumsy, names may be fair or foul, and words may be good or evil. Good names and words please the human heart, while evil names and words offend the human ear. Therefore, the ancients, when establishing names for settlements or children, invariably chose good names, lest the unworthy harm reality.\n\nIn former times, Bi Wan’s name—*wan* meaning \"abundance\"—presaged great fortune. Bi Wan was a descendant of the Duke of Bi and the son of Duke Wen. *Wan* signifies \"greatness.\" *Wei* also denotes a \"great settlement,\" and later, he was enfeoffed with the settlement of Wei. Bi Wan eventually became a minister. By the end of the Zhou, when the Marquis Wen of the state of Wei ascended the throne, his descendants indeed became kings.\n\nIn contrast, Chou of Jin, whose name meant \"enmity\" and \"misfortune,\" encountered disaster. The crown prince of the Jin lord was named Chou (\"enmity\"), and his misfortune was paired. Later, he fathered a son named Chengshi (\"accomplished master\"). When Chengshi grew up, he killed Chou. Yet abundance and greatness do not invariably bring good fortune, nor do enmity and misfortune always bring calamity. Still, people harbor love and aversion because names bear goodness or evil.\n\nToday, when rustics see a child playing in the daytime, they take it as an omen of joy and celebration; when they dream of sparrows at night, they take it as a sign of official rank. Yet those who see children playing are not necessarily joyful, nor do those who dream of sparrows necessarily don the cap of office. People delight in such things because their names flatter them.\n\nThe spring was called \"Thief’s Spring,\" and Confucius would not drink from it. The settlement was called \"Morning Song,\" and Yan Yuan would not lodge there. The lane was called \"Victorious Mother,\" and Zengzi turned his carriage away. *Ren* means \"wheel\"—when Zengzi wished to go to Zheng and reached the lane of Victorious Mother, he halted his wheels and would not tread its ground, turning his carriage back. The pavilion was called \"Cypress Man,\" and the Han emperor fled by night. The Han emperor was Gaozu. Passing the Cypress Man Pavilion at night, he wished to rest. He asked, \"What is the name of this pavilion?\" His attendants replied, \"It is called the Pavilion of the Planted Man.\" Gaozu said, \"If it is called the Pavilion of the Pressing Man, it would press upon one to hasten away.\" After he left, assassins indeed came to harm Gaozu, but by dawn, they could not find him.

He cannot even tell a horse’s sex or color—what skill does he have in judging horses?\" Bo Le replied, \"Kong Fangyu’s judgment of horses lies in their essence, not their outward form.\" Later, when the duke rode the horse, it indeed traveled a thousand *li* in a day. Though it did not chase the wind or outrun lightning, leaving dust and shadow behind, its swiftness was already evident.\n\nWhen Xue Zhu appraised swords—Xue Zhu, a man of Qin, was the world’s foremost judge of blades—he served the King of Wu in selecting swords. Though the blade had not yet severed the hide of a black rhinoceros on land or sliced through a flood-dragon in water, the sharpness of its edge was already revealed.\n\nThus, when Fan Li barked from the dog’s hole, Wen Zhong heard it and bowed to him. Fan Li was a man of Yue, as was Wen Zhong, who served as a minister to the King of Yue. When Wen Zhong passed Fan Li’s gate, Fan Li barked at him from the dog’s hole. Wen Zhong said, \"A dog barks at people—Fan Li must take me for one.\" He turned his carriage back to Fan Li’s door, entered, and bowed to him, recommending him as the King of Yue’s left minister. When the king wished to attack Wu, he followed the strategies of Wen Zhong and Fan Li and ultimately defeated the King of Wu. Fan Li later said to Wen Zhong, \"King Goujian of Yue has a long neck and a beak like a bird—he can share hardship but not joy. He will later harm me, and I wish to leave.\" Wen Zhong replied, \"In serving my lord, I would die to achieve renown. Even if he later harms me, I will accept death without regret, for I will never bear the name of one who betrayed his lord. I will not leave.\"",

Bao Long was a worthy man, a contemporary of Confucius.\n\nWhen Yao came to know Shun, the shade of the mulberry tree did not shift. Yao, intending to raise Shun from the shade of Thunder Marsh, spoke with him beneath a mulberry tree, and the mulberry’s shadow remained unmoved. Yao then knew Shun was a worthy man, fit to be Son of Heaven, and so yielded the throne to him.\n\nWhen King Wen came to know Lü Wang, he did not tarry through the long day. King Wen went out hunting and divined, saying, \"The hunt shall yield a great catch—not a bear, not a grizzly, but the teacher of an emperor.\" It was indeed Lü Wang, and the king shared his carriage with him on the return journey.\n\nThe subtlest flicker of brow or lash—\nLong ago, a man named Chen Yong was skilled at detecting thieves.

Chen Ping was a native of Huyou in Yangwu Commandery. In his youth, his family was poor, and he served as the village’s community head, dividing meat with perfect fairness. The village elders said to him, \"Young Master Chen divides the meat most evenly.\" Chen replied, \"If I were to govern the realm as its chancellor, I would divide it as evenly as this meat.\" Later, when Han and Chu contended to destroy Qin, Chen Ping served as a general under Xiang Yu. But Xiang Yu could not employ the worthy, so Chen abandoned Chu and came to join Han. The Han chancellor Wei Wu recommended him to the High Ancestor, who appointed him as Protector of the Army. Thus he shattered Chu and destroyed Qin, expounding six extraordinary strategies to pacify the realm. Hence it is said he abandoned Chu to join Han.\n\nWhen Han Xin fled to Blackwater, Xiao He knew his ability to command. Han Xin was a native of Huaiyin. Poor and without occupation, he favored wearing a long sword. Later, he fled to Blackwater and became a minor official, but when twelve men were condemned for an offense, all were executed. As the executioner’s blade reached Han Xin, he looked up at the executioner, Lord Teng, and said, \"Does the king seek to pacify the realm by slaying a stalwart?\" Lord Teng, hearing this, spared him. He was then brought before Xiao He, who recommended him to the High Ancestor. The High Ancestor appointed him Granary Intendant, but Han Xin, deeming the post too lowly, abandoned the High Ancestor and fled. When Xiao He heard that Han Xin had fled, he pursued him for three days before returning. He said to the High Ancestor, \"Han Xin is a renowned knight of the realm. If you employ him, he will stay; if not, he will ultimately flee.\" The High Ancestor then appointed him Grand General, and with that, he destroyed Zhao, shattered Wei, swept through the Three Qin, and pacified the realm—all through Han Xin’s power.\n\nWas it only after he expounded his six strategies that his brilliance became clear, or only after shattering Zhao and Wei that his talent was recognized?

      "translated_text": "When Gongshu carved the phoenix, its crest and spurs were not yet formed, its emerald plumage not yet set. Those who saw its body called it a quail or a kite; those who saw its head named it a partridge. All mocked its ugliness and laughed at its clumsiness. Yet when the phoenix was complete—its emerald crest towering like clouds, its crimson spurs flashing like lightning, its brocade body scattering like dawn’s glow, its patterned wings soaring with countless shafts of radiance—it spread its wings and soared through the rafters of the sky, circling for three days without alighting. Only then did people praise its wonder and extol its craftsmanship.\n\nWhen Yao faced the floodwaters, vast and surging, drowning the hills and engulfing the people in darkness and despair, Yu was but a common man, without merit or fame. Yet Yao, knowing him deeply, entrusted him with taming the waters. Yu then carved open Dragon Gate, hewed through Jing Mountain, guided the streams of Bear’s Ear, and pierced the peaks of Crow and Mouse. He raced against the wind—like a comb raking through hair—endured torrential rains, his face and eyes blackened by the wilds, his hands and feet calloused and cracked. He had no time to adjust his hat or pass through his own gate, yet he bound the hundred rivers to pour into the sea, extending west to the Flowing Sands, sparing the people from becoming fish and turtles. Only then did the masses sing his praises and recognize his worth.\n\nThus, to perceive skill in the raw is the insight of one like Wang Er toward Gongshu; to recognize craftsmanship only after the phoenix’s completion is the judgment of the common crowd. To know a man’s worth before he has achieved merit is Yao’s wisdom toward Yu; to acknowledge his virtue only after his deeds is the understanding of the masses. Truly, knowing others is no easy task.\n\nHou Ying, a gatekeeper and menial servant at Yi Gate, was recognized by Wuji. Hou Ying, a man of Wei named Ying, was keeper of the eastern gate of Daliang. Though a lowly bondsman, when the Lord of Wei, Wuji, sought worthy men, he prepared grand seats to receive the nobles of Wei. Before the feast began, Wuji himself drove to Hou Ying’s home, inviting him to ride together to the market. There, Hou Ying halted Wuji’s carriage and said, “In this market, there is a butcher named Zhu Hai—a worthy man, though his office has not advanced him, hidden in the slaughterhouse. I wish to speak with him; please wait a moment.” Hou Ying alighted and conversed with Zhu Hai at length, while the market folk cursed him for detaining the lord’s carriage. Yet Hou Ying, watching Wuji’s expression, saw no sign of impatience. Knowing Wuji to be a man of true virtue, he returned to the carriage, and together they went to Wuji’s estate. The assembled guests were astonished, only then realizing Hou Ying’s worth.\n\nYu Rang, a fugitive retainer of the Fan and Zhonghang clans, was esteemed by Zhibo. Yu Rang, originally in the service of Fan and Zhonghang, turned to Zhibo after they were destroyed. When Zhibo was later killed by Viscount Xiang of Zhao, Yu Rang sought to avenge him. Disguising himself as a menial, he lay in wait in the privy. As the viscount approached the privy gate, his heart stirred with unease. He ordered a search, and there was Yu Rang, a sword concealed at his side. Questioned, Yu Rang said, “I was a retainer of Zhibo. I have come to avenge him.” The viscount said, “A man of resolve!” and spared him. Later, Yu Rang lacquered his body, swallowed charcoal to distort his voice, and altered his appearance, intent on killing the viscount. His wife did not recognize him; his friends did, saying, “If you wish to kill the viscount, why not first serve him and then strike? Would that not be easier than needlessly disfiguring yourself?” Yu Rang replied, “Can one eat a man’s salary while harboring ill will toward him? I will not do so.” When the viscount next passed, Yu Rang lay in ambush beneath a bridge. As the viscount’s horse shied at the bridge, he said, “It must be Yu Rang.” A search confirmed it. Enraged, the viscount accused him: “Before, in the privy, I spared you. Now you return to this? You deserve death. You once served Fan and Zhonghang, yet when Zhibo destroyed them, you did not avenge them but now seek to kill me—why?” Yu Rang said, “I served Fan and Zhonghang as an ordinary man, and I repaid them as one. Zhibo treated me as a man of the state, and I repay him as one—even in death, I have no regrets. I beg you, my lord, grant me your robe, that I may strike it with my sword before I die.” The viscount removed his robe and gave it to him. Yu Rang, eyes blazing, seized the sword and struck the garment. Though the viscount felt no joy as the robe was struck, his anger gradually subsided. Within ten days, Yu Rang died. His name was honored, his person renowned, his glory filling the age. Though he cut his throat in the court of Wei or lacquered his body in the outskirts of Zhao, his heart sought only to repay a debt of gratitude. The empty left seat of the carriage—such was the esteem of a man of the state. The empty left seat refers to the honored place in a carriage reserved for a guest. The esteem of a man of the state was the treatment Yu Rang received from Zhibo.\n\nThe world’s men of resolve long to repay kindness with their lives, as the blind yearn to see or the lame to walk. Yet their eyes never open, their feet never move—they can only lament in vain.\n\n**On Recommending the Worthy, Nineteenth**\nA state’s need for the worthy is like a chariot’s reliance on its wheels or a boat’s dependence on its oars. Without wheels, the chariot cannot move; without oars, the boat cannot cross. Without the worthy, a state cannot be governed. A state abundant in worthy men is like riding in a carriage driven by Zaofu.",

      "translated_text": "The charioteer Zaofu was a master driver in King Mu’s time. As for the Yue traveler’s reliance on a boat—the Yue traveler was a man of Yue who dwelled by the sea and excelled at sailing. Without toiling his body, he could reach a thousand *li*; without moving his feet, he could arrive at Penglai. Penglai is a mountain in the sea, the abode of immortals.\n\nA court lacking in worthy men is like a phoenix missing six feathers, hoping to brush the azure sky with its back or pierce the crimson mist with its breast—yet it can never take flight. A towering mountain is not built from a single stone; a pavilion soaring into the clouds is not constructed from a single timber; a robe of white fox fur is not woven from the pelt of one armpit; the cosmos as a dwelling is not governed by one worthy alone.\n\nThus, the rulers of antiquity invariably sought out the worthy and summoned the reclusive, while ministers recommended the capable and promoted the wise. The Tang dynasty elevated the Eight Virtuous Ministers, fostering harmony and grace; the Zhou dynasty preserved the Ten Ministers of Order, spreading their resounding praise.\n\nWhen Confucius was in Wei, Zhao Yang abandoned his schemes. Zhao Yang of Jin, fond of warfare, wished to invade Wei, but knowing Confucius was there, he set aside his plans and could not attack. When Gànmù resided in Wei, the Qin people withdrew their troops. Gànmù was a worthy of Wei. Marquis Wen of Wei often visited him to consult on state affairs. When Qin intended to invade Wei, his advisors warned: \"Wei has the worthy Gànmù, and the marquis visits him daily to discuss governance—it cannot be attacked.\" The king of Qin halted his forces and did not invade Wei.\n\nWhile Gōng Qí had not yet fled, Duke Xian did not encroach. Gōng Qí was a prince of Yu. When Duke Xian of Jin sought to conquer Guo, he offered the famed jade of Chui Ji and a team of fine horses to Yu, requesting passage. Gōng Qí remonstrated: \"Guo is Yu’s shield. If the lips perish, the teeth grow cold.\" The men of Jin told Duke Xian: \"Gōng Qí is a weak and timid man—he cannot strengthen the defenses. Even if he did, the lord of Yu would not heed him. Simply offer more treasures, and success is assured.\" Duke Xian sent envoys with lavish gifts, and the lord of Yu, coveting the wealth, accepted. Gōng Qí then fled, and Duke Xian destroyed Guo, then turned his army to conquer Yu and returned.\n\nWhile Zǐyù still lived, Duke Wen sat askew. When Duke Wen of Jin battled Zǐyù, he crushed his forces. Yet the duke changed countenance and sat sideways, fearing that the worthy Zǐyù might devise new strategies against him.\n\nFrom this, we see that establishing governance and achieving order, repelling invasions and suppressing crises—these are the effects of recommending the worthy.\n\nA jade disk worth multiple cities lies buried in the shadows of Mount Jing; a luminous pearl hides its glow in the depths of Yu Pu. Jade flies without wings, pearls travel without a voice, yet their fame resounds from the Terrace of Zhang Hua, their brilliance dazzles in halls of silk and gauze—this is the power of a ruler’s elevation. But when worthy men possess talent yet refuse to come forward, when their wisdom rots in secluded peaks or their intellect decays in the brushwood—this is because no one has recommended them, and they cannot promote themselves.\n\nThe ancients competed to recommend those they knew, vying to draw forth their kind. If one’s talent suited governance, lineage was not questioned; if one’s wisdom could devise strategies, humble conduct was no obstacle.\n\nIn former times, rulers plucked the extraordinary from prisoners and convicts, raised the capable from butchers and peddlers. King Wen employed the Grand Duke, who had slaughtered oxen in Chao Ge. Emperor Gaozu employed Fan Kuai, who had sold dogs. Wuji employed Zhu Hai, who was a butcher. Guan Ying traded in silks and dyes, yet Gaozu employed him—all these were butchers and peddlers who were put to use.\n\nIn recommending the worthy, one did not avoid one’s own kin within the court, nor did one avoid suspicion when recommending from without. Qí Xī recommended his own son internally and a man he pitied externally. Thus, one who recommended the worthy received rewards in life and left behind an undying fragrance.\n\nOnce, Zigong asked Confucius: \"Who is the greatest worthy?\" Confucius replied: \"In Qi, there is Bào Shū; in Zheng, there is Zǐ Pí.\" Zigong said: \"But Qi has Guan Zhong, and Zheng has Zǐ Chǎn—are they not greater?\" Confucius said: \"I have heard that to promote the worthy is worthy, while to obstruct the worthy is unworthy.\"\n\nThough flesh and bone may resemble one’s ancestors, one’s words need not echo them. Bào Shū recommended Guan Zhong, and Zǐ Pí recommended Zǐ Chǎn—yet I have never heard that these two ever recommended anyone. To promote the worthy is a virtue surpassing one’s own worth—how much worse is it to suppress the worthy?\n\nThus, Qián Xī shattered his skull to vindicate Bai Li; Běi Guǒ slit his throat to exonerate Yan Ying. Běi Guǒ’s family was poor, unable to support his parents. Yanzi, knowing his worth, often shared grain with him. Later, when Yanzi was banished by the lord of Qi, Běi Guǒ cut his own throat in the ruler’s court to prove Yanzi’s innocence. The lord of Qi then reinstated Yanzi as prime minister.\n\nThose who give their lives without hesitation do so to recommend the worthy for the state. To sacrifice oneself without regret is the height of loyalty, the rarest of virtues.\n\nZāng Wénzhòng did not reveal Zhǎn Qín’s worth, and Confucius called him a usurper of office. Zhǎn Qín, also named Liǔxià, had served three times as magistrate without joy and been dismissed three times without resentment. Confucius, knowing his purity, married his elder brother’s daughter to him—only then did people recognize his worth.\n\nGōngsūn Hóng did not recommend Master Dong, and Jí Àn was about to denounce him for obstructing the worthy. Gōngsūn Hóng was Gōngsūn Hóng, and Master Dong was Dong Zhongshu. Jí Àn was a Han prime minister. Though Gōngsūn Hóng knew Dong’s worth, he did not recommend him, so Àn considered him a corrupter of the worthy.\n\nYú Qiū did not recommend Shū Fàng, and Lady Fan condemned him as unworthy. Yú Qiū was the prime minister of Chu. Once, King Zhuang of Chu held court with his ministers, and when he spoke with Yú Qiū at length, the sun grew late before he returned. Lady Fan descended the steps to greet him and asked the king: \"Why has the court lasted so long today?\" The king said: \"I was speaking with a worthy man, so it grew late.\" Lady Fan asked: \"Who is this worthy?\" The king replied: \"Yú Qiūzi.\"",

Yet their eyes never open, their feet never move—they can only lament in vain.\n\n**On Recommending the Worthy, Nineteenth**\nA state’s need for the worthy is like a chariot’s reliance on its wheels or a boat’s dependence on its oars. Without wheels, the chariot cannot move; without oars, the boat cannot cross. Without the worthy, a state cannot be governed. A state abundant in worthy men is like riding in a carriage driven by Zaofu.",

      "translated_text": "Lady Fan then covered her mouth and laughed, saying: \"Though I am unworthy, I have been fortunate enough to hold the dustpan and broom. Of those I have recommended, ten were of my own kind. Yet Master Yú Qiū has served as prime minister for ten years, and those he has advanced are either his own kin or his brothers—monopolizing Your Majesty’s favor and usurping Your Majesty’s authority. Knowing Sūnshū Áo’s worth yet failing to recommend him—how can this be called worthy? How can he be deemed a man of virtue?\"\n\nKing Zhuang told this to Yú Qiū, who replied: \"Your servant confesses his fault.\" Thereupon he recommended Sūnshū Áo as prime minister. The governance of Chu flourished, and this was Sūnshū Áo’s achievement.\n\nShù Xián failed to recognize eminent scholars, and his later conduct strayed from the proper path. Shù Xián, known as Master Shù Xián, once served as prime minister to the Marquis of Qi. Dismissed from office over a matter, he walked along the road on foot when someone asked him: \"Master, how have you come to this?\" Shù Xián replied: \"I held a position as lofty as the tripod yet could not promote a single worthy man. I amassed wealth by the thousands yet could not relieve a single scholar. Now I have come to this.\"\n\nTo present treasures to the state is not as good as presenting worthy men. Those who advance the worthy receive the highest rewards; those who obscure the worthy incur the most severe punishments. Such was the foresight of the good ministers of old, and such is the bright mirror for later generations.\n\nFire generates flame when blown, and a mirror becomes reflective when polished. Without blowing, fire has no outward radiance; without polishing, a mirror lacks inner illumination. Thus, blowing is the brilliance of fire, and polishing the splendor of a mirror.\n\nIn this world of succession, one must rely on reputation to manifest one’s radiance, just as fire and mirror depend on blowing and polishing. Even if one’s wisdom equals that of Lǐ Lǐ or one’s talent rivals that of Master Jiǎ—Lǐ Lǐ was Lǐ Zǐ, younger brother of King Hui of Qin, named Zhuāng, who lived in Lǐ Lǐ and was called Master Lǐ Lǐ. Witty and resourceful, his contemporaries called him a man of wisdom. Master Jiǎ was Jiǎ Yì of Luòyáng, skilled in literary composition. His contemporaries said of him: \"Jiǎ Yì, the talent of Luòyáng, is as brilliant as Zhōng Jūn of the mountains and Miào of the east.\"—dwelling in a humble abode without a confidant to converse with, one’s renown cannot spread near or far, nor can one’s fame reach the heavens.\n\nHad Liǔ Xià Huì never met Confucius, his pure and steadfast conduct would not have been known, and he would have remained a thrice-dismissed minister, a man without shame. Had Jì Bù never met Cáo Qiū, his promise of a hundred gold would not have been celebrated—Jì Bù was a man of the Hàn dynasty. When Cáo Qiū met him, he said: \"I would rather have Jì Bù’s single promise than a hundred catties of gold.\"—and he would have remained an ordinary captive, a man without honor. The reason these two men’s virtue spread in their time and their fame endured for ten thousand generations was the blowing and polishing of sages and worthies.\n\nOnce, a man brought a fine horse to market, but after three mornings, no one took notice. He then said to Bó Lè: \"I have brought a fine horse to sell, yet no one in the market appreciates it. I beg you to glance at it once, and I will offer half its price in gratitude.\" Thereupon Bó Lè came to the market, approached the horse, and greeted it with admiration. As he departed, he turned back to gaze at it. In a single morning, the horse’s price rose to a thousand gold. This horse was no different from what it had been the day before—no dull colt transformed into a swift steed. It was only that no one had recognized its worth, nor had anyone given it a second glance.\n\nThe camphor tree, with its gnarled roots and hooked branches, its knotted nodes and worm-eaten bark, its twisted, swollen trunk—such a tree would go unnoticed by all. Yet when a craftsman selects it, shapes it into the beams of a palace hall, paints it with cinnabar and lacquer, and adorns it with patterns of quails and waterweeds, then the lords and ministers of the realm cannot help but gaze at it in admiration. The nature of the wood remains the same, yet what was once despised is now prized—this is the work of the skilled artisan.\n\nA luminous pearl from Xíngxī or a jade disk that glows at night—when presented to a lord or king, they must be stored in a jade casket and bound with golden clasps. But if one were to casually toss them to someone, that person would not even glance in surprise, but would grasp their sword in anger. The snake that carries the night-glowing pearl wishes to repay the Marquis of Suí. Yet if it were to suddenly appear before him, the marquis would be startled and reach for his sword in anger, ready to strike—all because it had come without cause.\n\nWhy? Because it had come without cause.",

Thus, the frost-withered leaf clings to the autumn wind to gain its light ascent; the flying serpent attaches itself to the spring mist, aspiring to soar among the clouds; the shrew-mouse clings to the flea, striving to match the sun’s pace. In the West, there is a beast called the *shu*—its front resembles a rat, its rear a flea. When it halts, it crouches; when it runs, it bears the flea upon its back. If the rat is behind and the hare ahead, it cannot reach its food, so it must rely on the hare to feed it.

      "translated_text": "Lou Ji was a man of antiquity famed for his running, able to chase down the fleeing light of a woman in flight—thus the saying. Yet if he were to mount a weary black steed, he could not cover even a single *she* in a day (twenty *li* make one *she*), for the horse was but a donkey’s kin. Not that his own pace was slow, but what he relied upon was feeble.\n\nThus we see: when one clings to the right support, even a heavy stone may float, and short wings may fly far; when one clings to the wrong support, even light feathers sink, and swift feet falter. The swallow’s nest, woven of mud and mended with care, gleams like embroidered silk—no master potter could craft its like, so firm is its structure. Yet when the triumphant army returns and the tent-flaps are torn away, the nest shatters and the fledglings perish, for what it relied upon was perilous. The quail’s nest, bound to a reed’s stem with strands of silk and pearls, woven in delicate patterns—no seamstress’s skill could rival its artistry, so firm is its construction. Yet when the gale arrives (a mere breeze, in truth), the reed snaps and the eggs break. Why? Because what it relied upon was weak and frail.\n\nThus the crow has the nature to choose its tree, and the fish the instinct to select its pool, striving for the finest perch or shoal—this is what makes them noble.\n\n**Heart’s Concealment, Twenty-Second**\nThe vastness of the Two Modes may be measured by celestial cycles (twenty-nine years mark one such span). The movements of the Three Bonds may be gauged by outward signs and inner measures. The thunder’s roar may be conveyed through drums, and the shifts of wind and rain harmonized through music. Thus, where there is form to observe, its shadow cannot be hidden; where there is shape to see, its trace cannot be concealed; where there is sound to hear, its echo cannot be silenced; where there is color to perceive, its nature cannot be erased. Even the obscurities of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang, may be inferred through calculation and known to ear and eye. Yet as for man: the heart dwells within, emotions lie concealed beneath, and they cannot be measured by reckoning.\n\nThe human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to fathom than Heaven itself. Heaven has its seasons—spring, summer, autumn, winter—and its fixed times of dawn and dusk, but man’s true nature is hidden behind a thick facade, his depths unknowable. Thus, the heart may be resolute while the countenance is gentle; the bearing strong while the essence is weak; the appearance sincere while the conduct is sluggish; the temper fiery yet the affairs drawn out. One may adorn the exterior to obscure the truth: joy need not mean affection, anger need not mean hatred, laughter need not mean delight, tears need not mean sorrow. Such concealed emotions and hidden deeds are not easily discerned.\n\nThe sun hangs beyond the heavens, yet the heart lies within man—yet even as things are illuminated without, falsehood may still arise within. The heart resides within man, and wisdom dwells deeper still, where the spirit also shines. Yet what is external offers no proof of what lies within, and to seek the truth is no easy task. Dirt upon the face is met with scorn, but dirt within the heart goes unashamed. The face is exposed without, while the heart lies hidden within, so one may polish one’s demeanor, conceal one’s cunning, and hide one’s wit, never to be seen in a lifetime.\n\nIn Lu, Shaozheng Mao lived at the same time as Confucius. Confucius’s disciples filled his gate three times and emptied it three times, yet Yan Yuan alone never left, for he alone recognized the Sage’s virtue. The disciples abandoned Confucius for Shaozheng Mao not because they failed to recognize Confucius’s sagacity, but because they failed to recognize Shaozheng Mao’s deceit. Zigong said, “Shaozheng Mao is a learned man of Lu. If you, Master, were to take office, why would you put him first?” Confucius replied, “Ci, this is not a matter you can grasp.” For Shaozheng Mao’s heart was perverse yet restrained, his words cunning and contentious (his eloquence was as sharp as a beacon’s flame, his strength as fierce as a blade). His speech was false yet persuasive, his words coarse yet expansive, and he made the wrong seem smooth. Possessing these five deceptions, he confused even the worthy. Zigong’s keen insight could not perceive it—how much harder, then, to know others!\n\nThus we see: flattery resembles virtue, deceit resembles trust, eloquence resembles wisdom, and foolish honesty resembles sincerity—just as *jiwei* is mistaken for ginseng, and *shechuang* for *mowu* (the latter being today’s *shouqiong*). Common custom holds that none do not value themselves and despise others, esteem themselves and belittle others. In their minds, they do not merely seek to outwit the worthy or impose the inferior upon the superior. Yet because the human heart is so hard to know, it cannot be weighed by any standard. Unable to empty themselves and defer to others, they end up slighting the weighty and overpowering the long. Thus, the crone by the well boasts that her beauty surpasses Xi Shi’s, and Duke Huan of Qi vaunts his virtue above Yao and Shun’s. Even Zigong, when he first studied under Confucius, after one year claimed to have surpassed him, after two years deemed himself his equal, and only after three years realized he fell short. If Zigong, with all his talent, could not recognize the Sage’s virtue until he had glimpsed it from afar, how can ordinary men be expected to humble themselves?\n\nThus, truth and falsehood intertwine, the worthy and the foolish mingle, and without true wisdom, none can distinguish them. When Shaozheng Mao, a minister of Lu, plotted rebellion, Confucius, then serving as Minister of Crime, said to Duke Ding of Lu, “A man bold and cunning—this is one who brings chaos to the realm. You must execute him.” And so Duke Ding put Shaozheng Mao to death.\n\n**Fortune’s Block and Flow, Twenty-Third**\nFate knows adversity and prosperity, encounters know setback and success. Adversity and prosperity are opposites, setback and success follow different paths. Prosperity and success do not depend solely on wisdom, nor do adversity and setback arise from mere dullness. Why? Prosperity and adversity stem from fate, while setback and success lie in encounter. When fate brings setback, talent flows only to be dammed; when encounter brings success, talent dammed flows freely.",

The attendant who draped a robe feared his lord’s cold; the one who called out to stop the chariot feared his lord’s peril. Their loyalty and affection were the same, their transgression of duty equal—yet the attendant was punished, while the caller was deemed virtuous. This was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nWhen a magpie dropped a rotting rat, it was not the Yu family’s insult. The Yu sisters were feasting in their tower when a wandering swordsman passed below. Just then, an old magpie mid-flight let fall a rat, which happened to land as the Yu sisters burst into laughter. The swordsman mistook their laughter as mockery directed at him, believing they had dropped the filthy thing to humiliate him. Enraged, he slaughtered the entire Yu family.\n\nWhen a jar of water was poured onto the ground, it was not She Gu’s filth. The incident was unforeseen, and thus not his fault—yet the swordsman flew into a rage, and the Yu family was annihilated. When the lord of Zhu grew furious, She Gu escaped death. The lord of Zhu, ruler of the state, had risen drunk with She Gu. A gatekeeper, seeking money for wine, asked She Gu for some, but She Gu refused. The gatekeeper, nursing malice, knew the lord’s temper and poured a basin of water onto the threshold. When the lord emerged and asked why the ground was wet, the gatekeeper lied, “She Gu urinated here.” The lord, quick to anger, immediately ordered She Gu beaten to death, declaring, “He shall fall into a pit of fire and perish!” Yet She Gu survived. This, too, was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nIn Qi, Hua Shi retired to the hills and valleys, and the Grand Duke executed him. In Wei, Gan Mu secluded himself in obscurity, and Marquis Wen honored him. When Marquis Wen of Wei visited Gan Mu’s retreat, he remarked, “This is not Gan Mu’s dwelling.” Hearing that Gan Mu refused to serve him, the marquis said, “How dare I not show respect?” Gan Mu excelled in virtue; the marquis excelled in territory. Gan Mu was rich in righteousness; the marquis was rich in wealth. Yet land and wealth cannot compare to virtue and righteousness. Thus, the marquis treated him with the reverence due a teacher—how much more so with honor? He bestowed upon him a generous stipend. Later, when Qin rebelled, Qin’s marshal Tang Ju cautioned, “In Wei there is a man named Gan Mu, abundant in virtue and righteousness. Marquis Wen honors him, and thus the people’s hearts are won. We cannot invade.” Qin then withdrew its troops and refrained from aggression.\n\nThe Grand Duke’s wisdom was no greater than Marquis Wen’s, nor did Gan Mu’s virtue surpass Hua Shi’s—yet one was honored, the other executed. This was a matter of encounter and non-encounter.\n\nDong Zhongshu’s wisdom and virtue crowned his generation, yet his rank barely exceeded that of a scholar. Dong Zhongshu was a native of Guangchuan, well-versed in all the classics, with answers to every question. He served the Han and rose to the position of Grand Master of Palace Leisure.\n\nTian Qianqiu had no extraordinary conduct, yet a single word won him the post of prime minister. The elderly Hu Guan, surnamed Tian and named Qianqiu, was eighty years old. Emperor Wu of Han, in his later years, grew suspicious and weary of his ministers’ prayers and supplications. He dispatched Jiang Chong to root out sorcery and malevolent qi. Jiang Chong bore ill will toward the crown prince. Fearing that the prince would succeed the emperor, he falsely accused the prince of burying a bronze figurine beneath the imperial bed to curse the emperor. He then had a shaman falsely claim that the palace was tainted with malevolent qi. The emperor sent Jiang Chong to investigate, and upon digging beneath the bed, they uncovered the bronze figurine. Jiang Chong declared it proof of the prince’s treachery.\n\nThe prince’s tutor, fearing punishment, advised the prince, “Jiang Chong and the shaman have found the bronze figurine. We cannot know if it is real. Without proof of your innocence, you must seize Jiang Chong and interrogate him to uncover the truth.” The prince then mobilized his forces, killed Jiang Chong, and burned his body. The shaman, under duress, confessed to Jiang Chong’s scheme against the prince. At the time, the emperor was at the Ganquan Palace. Liu Quli rushed to report, “The prince has rebelled and killed Jiang Chong!” The emperor immediately dispatched troops to besiege the prince. The prince resisted with his own forces, and battle erupted in Chang’an. The prince fled.\n\nThree days later, Tian Qianqiu submitted a memorial pleading for the prince: “Jiang Chong was wicked, fabricating sorcery to frame the prince. The prince had no intent to rebel. A son may take up his father’s weapons to save his life. The prince is innocent; he should be recalled.” The emperor, in his old age, longed for the prince and sent men to search for him. By then, the prince had already died. Moved by Tian Qianqiu’s words, the emperor appointed him prime minister—thus, a single word won him the post.\n\nLiu Quli commanded the troops of the Three Auxiliaries—Left Fengyi, Right Fufeng, and the capital district—against the prince. The prince was defeated, fled to the city, and hanged himself. Later, learning the prince had no treacherous intent, the emperor built the Tower of Longing for His Son.",

      "translated_text": "Those who serve the same enlightened ruler yet find themselves divided by vast disparities in rank and fortune do so by virtue of *encounter* or the lack thereof. When Zhuang Jiang married into Wei, though beautiful, she found no favor; when the hunchbacked woman married into Qi, though ugly, she enjoyed the king’s favor. In Qi there was a hunchbacked girl who, while gathering mulberry leaves in the fields, chanced upon the king’s outing. All the others came to gaze upon the king, but the hunchbacked girl alone did not look. The king sent someone to ask, “Everyone else is looking at the king—why do you alone refuse?” She replied, “I was sent by my parents only to gather leaves. They did not instruct me to look at the king, so I dare not.” The king then said, “This girl is truly virtuous.” He wished to take her back to the capital in his carriage. The girl said, “If the king wishes to take me, I dare not refuse. But if I were to follow you now, I would be a runaway girl—this is why I cannot go.” Later, the king sent gifts of silk and treasure to formally betroth her. As she entered the capital, the palace women and concubines, hearing that the king’s new consort had been found while gathering mulberry leaves, came to see her. When they beheld her—ugly and hunchbacked—they all laughed at her. Yet she became the king’s most favored.\n\nWhether one meets with good fortune or not is a matter of *ming* (destiny); whether one is worthy or not is a matter of *xing* (innate nature). To resent one’s lack of worth is to fail to understand *xing*; to lament one’s ill fortune is to fail to comprehend *ming*. If one can face adversity without fear and endure poverty and low status without sorrow, one may be called one who has mastered *ming*.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: Destiny and Physiognomy**\n*Ming* (destiny) is the root of life, while *xiang* (physiognomy) assists in its fulfillment. Destiny may exist without manifesting in form, but physiognomy is always expressed in form. Where there is destiny, there must be physiognomy; where there is physiognomy, there must be destiny. Both are bestowed by Heaven and depend upon each other to take shape.\n\nA person’s destiny and physiognomy determine their worth, rank, longevity, and fortune, shaped by *qi* at the moment of conception. At the time of birth, the most wondrous may be influenced by the Five Phases and the Three Luminaries, or by the traces of dragons, auspicious *qi*, or prophetic dreams. Even ordinary people receive their destiny from Heaven, governed by the stars—those who align with auspicious constellations prosper, while those who align with inauspicious ones suffer misfortune.\n\nOnce the *qi* is received and destiny is fixed, neither ghosts nor spirits can alter it, nor can sages or wise men reverse it. Huaxu stepped in the giant’s footprint and gave birth to Fuxi; Nüwa was moved by the radiant light piercing the sun and bore Zhuanxu; Qingdu coupled with the Red Dragon and gave birth to Tang Yao; Wodeng saw the great rainbow and bore Shun; Xiuli witnessed the falling star and bore Yu of Xia; Fudu saw the white *qi* piercing the moon and bore Tang of Yin; Tairen dreamed of a tall man and bore King Wen; Yan Zheng was moved by the Black Emperor and bore Confucius; and Liu Ao was moved by the Red Dragon and bore the Han founder. Weizi was influenced by the Star of the Oxherd, Yan Yuan by the Central Terrace Star, Zhang Liang by the Fox Star, Fan Kuai by the Wolf Star, and Laozi by the Fire Star—all such sages and worthies were born under celestial omens.\n\nPhysiognomy may be discerned in flesh and bone, or in voice and complexion. Worth, rank, longevity, and fortune all leave external signs. Thus, the Five Peaks rise with towering majesty; the Four Rivers flow with crystalline purity; the Five Colors flourish like radiant clouds; and the Five Tones resound like bells and chimes. Those skilled in observation are like Fenghu distinguishing swords—Fenghu was a sword appraiser of Qin—or Sun Yang judging horses—Sun Yang was Bo Le, the famed horse physiognomer. To grasp their subtle principles is no easy task.\n\nFuxi had a horned forehead; the Yellow Emperor, a dragon’s countenance; Emperor Ku, shoulders like a bear’s; Zhuanxu, fused cheekbones; Yao, eyebrows of eight hues; Shun, double pupils; Yu, ears with three openings; Tang, arms with two elbows; King Wen, four nipples; King Wu, teeth like coins; Confucius, a reversed roof; Yan Hui, double pupils; Gaoyao, a raven’s beak—all such sages and worthies were born with extraordinary features. Shun’s double pupils were a sign of supreme clarity, yet Xiang Yu and Wang Mang also had double pupils. King Goujian of Yue had a long neck and a raven’s beak, an omen of an unpeaceful end, yet Yu of Xia shared the same features. Wang Mang’s double pupils were like a nag with a single hair of a fine steed—it cannot be called a steed. Yu’s long neck and raven’s beak were like a dragon with a single scale of a snake—it cannot be called a snake.\n\nEven among the common people, all possess signs of their destiny. Thus, the son of the Lord of Lu, Guzi, had a broad lower face, and Shu Xing, skilled in physiognomy, knew he would have descendants. Guzi was the son of the Lord of Lu; Gu was his surname. At birth, his upper face was narrow and his lower face broad. Shu Xing, adept in physiognomy, divined, “This man has an auspicious appearance.” Later, he indeed became king of Lu. *Dui* and *Feng* are hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*.\n\nWei Qing had a square forehead, and Jing Tuo predicted his wealth and nobility. Wei Qing’s father had secretly consorted with a palace maid, and Wei Qing was born. When he grew up, the household of the princess treated him as a slave, mocking him and ordering him to tend horses with the black slaves. Jing Tuo said to Wei Qing, “Your forehead is square—you are destined for nobility.” Wei Qing replied, “Now I am a slave—what nobility can there be?” Later, he became skilled in archery and horsemanship. When the Han sought to destroy the Xiongnu, Wei Qing enlisted and, through his merits in campaigning against the Xiongnu, was enfeoffed as Grand General and established a marquisate.\n\nZhou Yafu had vertical lines on his forehead, and Xu Fu predicted he would starve to death. Yafu, whose surname was Zhou and given name Yafu, was the third son of Zhou Bo and served as the General of Fine Willows. Xu Fu examined his physiognomy and said, “Vertical lines enter the forehead—later, you will die of starvation.” Yafu was later imprisoned on false charges and starved to death after seven days without food, just as Xu Fu had foretold.\n\nYang Fen’s cry was like a jackal’s, and his grandmother, Shu Ji, foresaw the destruction of his clan. Yang Fen was a grandee of Jin. When he was born, his grandmother, Shu Ji, went to hear his cry. The infant wailed like a jackal, and Shu Ji said, “This child’s cry is like a jackal’s—he will bring ruin to our clan.” She turned away and refused to see him. When he grew up, he indeed caused great chaos in Jin. In the fifth month of summer, he was killed by the Jin, and his entire clan was exterminated.",

      "translated_text": "Fate and fortune in physiognomy hang upon Heaven. If one’s destiny is to be poor and lowly, even if noble, misfortune will still befall; if one’s destiny is to be rich and noble, even if one seeks to destroy them, harm cannot be done. When Xia’s Kong Jia hunted on Mount Ji, a great wind arose, darkening the sky, and he entered a household. The master’s wife was then giving birth, and someone divined: “One born after the arrival of a guest is inauspicious—this child will surely bring calamity.” Kong Jia took the child and said: “If he is to be my son, who would dare bring him calamity?” When the child grew up, he split firewood with an axe and severed his left foot, then became a great musician. Kong Jia said: “Alas, this is the decree of fate.”\n\nEmperor Wen of Han favored Deng Tong because of a dream. The emperor dreamed of falling into a well and being saved by Deng Tong, and thereafter bestowed great favor upon him. A physiognomer divined that Deng Tong would die in poverty and starvation. The emperor said: “Whether he is rich depends on me—how could he be poor?” He granted him a copper mountain, allowing him exclusive rights to cast coins. Later, Deng Tong borrowed clothes and food and died as a dependent in another’s home.\n\nWhen Ziwen was born, he was abandoned as an inauspicious child. Yun was originally a descendant of Zhurong, though his surname was unknown. Ziwen was the son of Guobo Bi. Bi’s father died early, and he followed his mother to live in his maternal uncle’s home. When he grew up, he seduced the daughter of Yunzi, and she bore Ziwen. Yunzi’s wife, ashamed that her daughter had conceived out of wedlock, abandoned the child in the mountains. Yunzi went hunting and saw a tiger nursing an infant. He returned and told his wife, who said: “This must be the child my daughter bore with Guobo Bi. I was indignant and sent him to the mountains.” Yunzi then retrieved the child, raised him, and betrothed his daughter to Guobo Bi. The people of Chu called Ziwen “Gu Wutu,” and he later became the Prime Minister of Chu. A tiger had nursed him, and thus he was taken in and raised, eventually rising to become Prime Minister.\n\nIn the kingdom of Baoli, a maidservant of the king became pregnant, and the king sought to kill her. The maid said: “Qi descended from Heaven, and thus I conceived.” When the child was born, he was cast into a pigsty. The pigs breathed upon him with their qi. He was then abandoned in a horse stable, and the horses also breathed upon him, so he did not die. He ultimately became the king of Fuyu.\n\nThus, the fate of good and evil descends as if from Heaven or emerges as if from the earth—it cannot be deduced by reason or calculation, nor can it be seized by wisdom or strength. Now, people do not understand that fate is limited and yet vainly covet excess; their destiny lies in poverty and lowliness, yet they scheme for wealth and nobility; their destiny lies in early death, yet they seek longevity in the face of peril—all are deeply deluded.\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Five, End*\n*Commentary by Yuan Xiaozheng, Record Keeper and Assistant Magistrate of Bozhou*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Six: The Folly of Fault-Finding**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven is formless and silent, invisible to the eye and inaudible to the ear. It cannot be sought through echoes or shadows, nor can it be described by praise or blame. From this truth onward, no affair attains perfect beauty, no reputation achieves unblemished glory. Even the vastness of Heaven and Earth, the radiance of the Three Luminaries, and the wisdom of sages and worthies are not exempt from censure.\n\nThus, Heaven bears the omen of rifts, Earth the form of fissures; the sun and moon suffer eclipses, the five planets harbor comets and baleful stars. Yao was slandered for lacking filial piety, Shun for imprisoning his father; Tang was branded for exiling his lord, King Wu for slaying his sovereign. Duke Huan of Qi was reviled for greed and debauchery, Duke Wen of Jin for disloyalty; Yi Yin was accused of deceiving his ruler, Guan Zhong of usurping his superior. If even the divine spirits of the Two Modes and Seven Luminaries cannot avoid the slightest flaw, if the sagely kings Yao, Shun, Tang, and Wu cannot escape suspicion and slander, and if the worthy Duke Huan and Yi Yin and Guan Zhong cannot be free of minor faults—how then can the scholars of the world hope to avoid resentment and reproach, or live without regret and fear?\n\nThus, the jade of Jing’s peaks must bear tiny flaws, and the pearl of the black dragon may have a slight blemish. The Dragon King of the sea possesses a luminous moon-pearl beneath his chin. This dragon dwells in the depths of the ninefold abyss. Once, a child from a seaside village passed by and, finding the dragon’s gate open, entered his palace. The dragon was asleep, so the child stole the moon-pearl from beneath his chin. Though the pearl’s value was beyond price, its slight imperfection led the villagers to fear the child might return to the ninefold abyss and be poisoned by the dragon. When they called out to him, the child, facing them, crushed the moon-pearl to pieces. Yet its brilliance had already shone for a thousand years, and its worth had soared among kings and lords—all because a minor flaw could not mar its great beauty.\n\nNow, those who resent others’ petty shortcomings and envy their strengths will never attract the worthy. To seek talent thus is like searching for footprints in an empty book or a path in spilled water—it cannot be done. Even the ministers who stabilize a state have minor flaws; the ruler does not discard them because he does not allow small matters to obstruct great ones. To let the small obscure the great is no way to seek men of ability.\n\nYi Yin was but a cook in Xia; Fu Yue, a convict laborer in Yin; Baili Xi, a fugitive slave of Yu; and Duan Ganmu, a merchant in Jin. Ganmu, a native of Jin, was a broker who traded in goods and never sought office. When Marquis Wen of Wei learned of his worth, he went to Ganmu’s home to recruit him. Ganmu remained seated and did not rise, yet the marquis stood respectfully by his side, too awed to grow weary. He then appointed Ganmu as his prime minister. Later, when Duke Jian of Qin sought to attack Wei, he feared Ganmu’s great wisdom and the strategies he would devise for Marquis Wen, so he abandoned his campaign. Though these four men were undeniably worthy, their origins were not without stain.\n\nNo reputation attains dual glory, no affair achieves perfect beauty. Once, Marquis Wen of Wei asked Li Ke, “What sort of man is Wu Qi?” Wu Qi, a native of Wei, had sought office in Chu. He bit his mother’s arm to swear an oath that he would not return for nine years, but when his mother died, he still did not go home. A minister of Chu said to the king, “Wu Qi did not return for his mother’s funeral—this is unfilial. How can he be made a minister?” Wu Qi then returned home to observe three years of mourning before going to Wei to seek office. Marquis Wen appointed him governor of Xihe. The marquis had previously lost five cities to Qin, but Wu Qi recovered them. He then led a campaign against Qin, reclaiming the five cities for Wei, and later conquered Yan and Zhao in the north, bringing them under Wei’s rule—all through Wu Qi’s merit.\n\nLi Ke replied, “Wu Qi is greedy and lustful, yet in his command of troops, even Sima Rangju cannot surpass him.” The marquis thus made him a general. The recapture of Qin’s five cities and the conquest of Yan and Zhao were all due to Wu Qi’s efforts.\n\nWhen Wei Wuzi recommended Chen Ping to the King of Han, someone slandered him, saying, “Though Chen Ping is a man, he is as beautiful as jade on a cap—his outward appearance may be fine, but his inner worth is doubtful. Moreover, I hear he seduced his sister-in-law and accepted bribes.” The king then distanced himself from Chen Ping and reproached Wei Wuzi. Wuzi said, “I recommended a man of extraordinary strategies, one whose counsel is truly sufficient to benefit the state. What do his minor faults matter to the great affairs of the realm?” The king then promoted Chen Ping to the rank of protector-general, allowing him to implement his plans. Thus, when Xiang Yu’s advisor Fan Zeng died of a carbuncle and Chu perished, and when the Han army was saved by the opening of the enemy’s ranks—these were all due to Chen Ping’s schemes.\n\nFan Zeng was a great minister of Chu. When Xiang Yu besieged the King of Han in his city, Chen Ping devised a plan to send precious treasures to Chu’s generals. The King of Chu learned of this and sought to execute them. Fan Zeng advised, “This is Chen Ping’s scheme—do not kill them.” The king said, “A warrior who loses his loyalty and accepts another’s wealth—how can he be a minister?” He then executed them, and Fan Zeng died of a carbuncle. Chen Ping also carved wooden figures, dressed them in silk and fine robes, and placed them on the city walls as beautiful women, claiming they were beauties to be given to the Xiongnu chanyu. The chanyu’s wife, Lady Ban, heard of this and, fearing the chanyu would favor these women, opened the ranks to rescue the Han army. All these were Chen Ping’s stratagems.\n\nThe High Ancestor overlooked Chen Ping’s minor transgressions and adopted his six extraordinary strategies; Marquis Wen disregarded Wu Qi’s small faults and gained the merit of five cities. Had these two rulers dismissed such worthy men for their minor flaws, the survival of Wei and the outcome of the struggle between Han and Chu would have been uncertain. Wu Qi would have been buried in infamy for his greed and lust, and Chen Ping would have been ruined by accusations of bribery and theft.\n\nYet when the world observes scholars, it sees only their meticulous demeanor and fondness for trivial purity, and calls them men of talent. If a scholar has grand aspirations but neglects his appearance, or if his bearing is careless and his manners slightly unrefined, he is dismissed as worthless.",

      "translated_text": "To see a single worm-eaten jujube and thus fell the entire tree; to spy a single stain on a bolt of brocade and cast the whole length into the refuse. Duke Huan of Qi deeply understood Yu Qi and was about to entrust him with governance. His ministers all slandered him, saying: \"Yu Qi is a man of Wei, not far from Qi. Your Lordship may send someone to inquire about him. If he is truly worthy, it will not be too late to employ him.\" The Duke said: \"Not so. I fear that if he has minor flaws, the people will know only his small faults and forget his great virtues—this is how the world loses its finest men.\" That very night, he raised torches and enfeoffed Yu Qi, making him chief minister. Nine times he assembled the feudal lords, and once he rectified the realm. Duke Huan may truly be called one who knew how to seek out worthy men.\n\nThus Confucius, upon seeing a single virtue in a man, would forget his hundred faults; while Bao Shu, upon hearing of a single transgression, would remember it for a lifetime. The Master was so magnanimous, Bao Shu so narrow-minded. From this we see how vastly the capacity of sages and worthies differs.\n\nDrizzling rain does not nourish the finest grain; the nest of a swallow cannot hold the egg of a magpie. Lofty mountains and vast marshes do not reject filth and muck; true talents who assist the age are not bound by trivial conduct. Why is this? A small measure cannot contain great form; a great vessel does not distinguish minor flaws.\n\nHuman nature invariably has its petty shortcomings. If a man is broadly right, even if he has small blemishes, they are not enough to be a hindrance. If he is broadly wrong, even if he has a humble gate—crossed timbers for a door, meaning the gate at the head of an alley—his petty conduct is not worth discussing in matters of grand strategy.\n\nFan Kuai was a butcher and peddler; Xiao He and Cao Shen were petty clerks—when Xiao He and Cao Shen were young, they served as lowly functionaries, so poor their wives could not be counted.

Convicts marked by ink from penal servitude were assigned to guard these gates—not the gates of private households. Unless the lord of the state had departed the palace, these guards were known as the *liwei* of the official gates. The *liwei* consisted of two men, one on the left and one on the right, walking apart from each other, one halberd held before and one behind, for their own defense.\n\nYing Bu, surnamed Ying and named Bu, in his youth had his fortune told by a physiognomist, who declared: \"First you will be branded, later you will become a king.\" The \"branding\" referred to the punishment of ink. Later, Ying Bu was indeed convicted and tattooed, reduced to the lowly post of a gate guard.

      "translated_text": "Zhang Jingyang, though a great libertine of Yingzhong, overawed the feudal lords; Yan Zhuozou, though a notorious bandit of Liangfu—a native of Qi who led the Red Eyebrows in Daliang and later became a high minister to Duke Jing—rose to become a meritorious minister of Qi. All had their flaws, yet their fame and achievements endured because they grasped the grand strategy.\n\nYuan Jingmu—a man of Chu—collapsed from hunger by the roadside. A passerby offered him food and fed him. Jingmu asked, “Who are you to give me food?” The man replied, “I am the bandit father of Huqiu.” Jingmu said, “Since you are the bandit father of Huqiu, I will not eat food tainted by injustice.” He pressed his hands to the ground, vomited the food, and died.\n\nBao Jiao—also known as Bao Sheng—wore no silk or hemp, ate no grains, and carried a basket to gather wild fruits for sustenance. Zigong passed him on the road and asked, “Why have you come to this?” Jiao replied, “I have heard that to persist in the Dao when unrecognized is a withered path, and to ceaselessly seek office when spurned by those above is to destroy one’s integrity. To pursue profit while one’s conduct withers and one’s integrity crumbles—this is what I find shameful.” Zigong said, “I have heard that those who do not belong to an age do not enjoy its benefits, and those who defile their lord do not tread its soil. How much less should one eat its vegetables?” Bao Jiao said, “I have heard that the worthy value advancement and lightly regard retreat, while the incorruptible readily embrace death over dishonor.” He then cast himself beneath a bridge and drowned in the Luo River. Lu Zhonglian remarked: “Bao Jiao could not adapt to the world and brought about his own death—this was not the way of a true man. Though he upheld his principles and refused food tainted by injustice, starving to death without achieving great deeds to save the drowning, his minor integrity prevailed while his greater integrity faltered.”\n\nBoyi and Shuqi, pure as ice and jade, refused to succeed the lord of Guzhu, would not eat the grain of Zhou, and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. Yang Zhu preserved his life and nurtured his nature, avoiding profit and harm. When asked, “Would you pluck a single hair from your body to benefit the world?” he replied, “The world’s affairs cannot be saved by a single hair.” If it were Mozi, who embodied benevolence, grinding his body from head to foot for the world’s benefit, he would do so. Though these two followed different paths, their renown was the same: they would not sacrifice even a hair to benefit the world. Though their virtue was not lacking and their conduct lofty, could they have brought peace to their age, trodden the blade’s edge, and achieved lasting fame? Their example may serve as a model for all generations, yet they were unfit for the offices of Yi Yin or Guan Zhong.\n\n**Section Twenty-Seven: Aptitude**\n\nThings have their beauty and ugliness, and their uses must be fitting. Beauty is not always prized, nor is ugliness forever discarded. Purple sable and white fox, fashioned into fur robes, shimmer like auspicious clouds and gleam like carved jade—this is the beauty of noble attire. Coarse reeds and rushes, woven into rain capes and hats, appear sparse and plain, dark as rotting wood—this is the ugliness of plant-fiber garments. Though fur and straw differ, they equally clothe the body; though beauty and ugliness diverge, their utility is the same when apt.\n\nNow, in a chamber of embroidered curtains, a rain cape is no match for a fur robe; in snow and rain, a fur robe cannot compare to a rain cape. From this, we see that aptitude in application, suited to the moment, fulfills its purpose—each has its proper use.\n\nDuring the winter and summer festivals, when people gather in joy, they sing *Cai Ling*; when hauling stones or towing boats—whether by pulling ropes or guiding vessels—they chant *xu’ao*. Though these songs have their stirring melodies, they are set aside when the task demands strength, for *xu’ao* is more fitting. When Bian Zhuangzi ascended the court of Yin, his jade pendants chimed, his demeanor was warm, and his voice gentle. Yet when he wrestled a tiger, he rolled up his sleeves, bared his arms, glared fiercely, and roared—though this was no less fine than his gentle mien and soft voice, it was less fitting when facing a ferocious beast.\n\nThe child prodigy of Anling was the fairest in the land, his eight tones blending in harmony. Had he been made to perform with the shrill, grating sounds of a blind musician or dwarf, he would have paled beside them. The pearl held in the snake’s mouth—a treasure passed down through the ages—if used to sling at crows, is no more forceful than a clod of mud. The sword of Tangxi, the sharpest in the world, if used to harvest grain, is no more effective than a sickle. In these four cases, beauty is not always prized, nor is ugliness forever discarded—each has its proper use.\n\nLong ago, a rustic rejected Zigong’s eloquence and delighted in the stableman’s plain speech. When Confucius traveled to Mount Mu, his horse strayed and ate a farmer’s grain. The farmer seized the horse and refused to return it. The Master sent Zigong to retrieve it, but the farmer ignored his ornate words. Later, the stableman was sent, and he spoke bluntly: “The grain from the Eastern Sea to the Western Sea is all yours—if the horse does not eat it, what else should it eat?” The farmer, hearing this, returned the horse.\n\nKing Goujian of Yue spurned the refined music of the *lai* flute and favored the coarse songs of the countryside. It was not that Zigong was inferior to the stableman, nor that the *lai* flute was worse than rustic tunes—yet beauty is not always embraced, nor ugliness always rejected, for each thing has its use.",

Lord Mengchang, a prince of Qi, had three thousand retainers in his household. The highest guests received meat, the middle guests fish, and the lowest guests vegetables. Feng Huan dwelt among the lowest for three years, yet Mengchang did not recognize him. Then he plucked his zither and sang:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!—*\n*With no fish to eat.\"*\nThe lord then granted him fish. He sang again:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!—*\n*With no carriage to ride.\"*\nThe lord then granted him a carriage.\n\nLater, when Lord Mengchang entered Qin, the Qin king imprisoned him, intending to kill him. Mengchang sent someone to beseech the Qin king’s consort for help. The consort said, \"Lord Mengchang once presented the king with a white fox-fur robe. If he gives me another, I will secure his release.\" The messenger returned and told Mengchang, who replied, \"I have only one such robe, already presented—how can I obtain another?\" At this, the retainer Feng Huan stole into the Qin palace by night, took the fox-fur robe, and delivered it to the consort. Overjoyed, she urged the king, \"Lord Mengchang is a prince of Qi. If you kill him, you will make an enemy of Qi. Better to release him.\" The king heeded her words and freed Mengchang. Fearing discovery of the theft, Mengchang fled by night back to Qi. When he reached the Qin pass, the sky was still dark, and the gate remained closed. Feng Huan imitated a rooster’s crow, and all the roosters at the pass joined in; he barked like a dog, and the pass’s dogs barked in response. The guards, hearing the crowing and barking, opened the gate. Mengchang crossed thirty *li* beyond the pass before the Qin king’s pursuing troops arrived—too late to overtake him.\n\nEach talent has its use; none should be discarded. Had Yu Zi been Mengchang’s retainer, he would have suffered the disgrace of capture and imprisonment. Had the rooster-crower served Duke Huan of Qi, he could not have aided the duke’s hegemony or assembled the feudal lords nine times. When passing a checkpoint, none is better than the rooster-crower; to exalt a hegemon, none is better than the merchant-singer. Though the merchant-singer’s elegance and the rooster-crower’s coarseness differ, in resolving crises and averting peril, their principle is one.\n\nThe market thief of Chu, a great bandit of the realm, was renowned. Yet when he grappled with a tiger, he rolled up his sleeves, flexed his arms, glared fiercely, and roared—no less fierce than the beauty of a gentle demeanor and humble tone. But in subduing a ferocious beast, nothing suited better than rolling up one’s sleeves.\n\nThe divine child of Anling was the fairest in the land. When the eight instruments played in harmony, had he used his wailing, shrill voice to cut through the music, he would have fallen short of the blind musicians and dwarves in grace.\n\nThe pearl held in the serpent’s mouth: Lord Sui of the state of Sui once saw a green snake wounded on the road. He took the snake home, treated its wounds with medicine, and fed it meat. When the wound healed, he released it.

      "translated_text": "The song went:\n*\"Vast are the springs, free the swimming fish—\nOne who cherishes virtue yet serves not\nMay yet shelter a general.\"*\n\nThe \"Cock-Crow Guest\" was Feng Xuan, a retainer of Lord Mengchang. Lord Mengchang, a prince of Qi, kept three thousand guests in his household. The highest-ranked received meat, the middle-ranked fish, and the lowest vegetables. Feng Xuan dwelled among the lowest for three years, yet Mengchang took no notice of him. Then Feng Xuan plucked his zither and sang:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!\nNo fish to eat!\"*\nThe lord then granted him fish. He sang again:\n*\"A great man departs—ah!\nNo carriage to ride!\"*\nThe lord then granted him a carriage.\n\nLater, when Lord Mengchang entered Qin, the Qin king imprisoned him, intending to kill him. Mengchang sent a messenger to beseech the Qin king’s consort for aid. She said, *\"Lord Mengchang once presented the king with a white fox-fur robe. If he gives me another, I will secure his release.\"* The messenger returned and told Mengchang, who replied, *\"I have only one such robe, already presented to the king—how can I obtain another?\"* Then Feng Xuan, a guest, stole into the Qin palace by night, took the fox-fur robe, and delivered it to the consort. Overjoyed, she urged the king, *\"Lord Mengchang is a prince of Qi. If you kill him, you will make an enemy of Qi. Better to release him.\"* The king heeded her and freed Mengchang.\n\nFearing discovery of the theft, Mengchang fled by night back to Qi. When he reached the Qin pass, dawn had not yet broken, and the gates remained shut. Feng Xuan imitated a cock’s crow, and all the roosters in the pass joined in; he barked like a dog, and the guard dogs barked in response. The guards, hearing the cocks crow and dogs bark, opened the gates. Mengchang crossed the pass and had traveled thirty *li* when the Qin king’s pursuing forces arrived—too late to overtake him.\n\nEach talent has its use; none should be discarded. Had Mengchang relied on Yuzi to assemble his retainers, he would have suffered the humiliation of capture and imprisonment. Had the \"Cock-Crow\" skill been entrusted to Duke Huan of Qi, it could not have aided his hegemony or his nine assemblies of the feudal lords. When passing a checkpoint, nothing serves better than a cock’s crow; to exalt a hegemon, nothing surpasses the *Shang* song. Though the *Shang* song is refined and the cock’s crow base, in resolving crises and averting peril, their principle is one.\n\nThe \"Market Thief\" of Chu was the greatest bandit in the world. When the king of Qi attacked Chu, Chu sent Zifan to lead the defense. Yet the king and his ministers, conferring together, could devise no way to repel the Qi forces. Zifan, in his youth, had admired knights-errant. The Market Thief came to him and said, *\"I hear you favor knights-errant. I am the Market Thief of the world.\"* Zifan, hearing this, did not even pause to don his cap but went out to greet him. After speaking with him, he dispatched troops to attack Qi.\n\nThe king of Chu, bewildered and fearful, saw no solution. The Market Thief secretly entered the Qi camp, stole the general’s bed-curtain, and presented it to Zifan. Zifan sent it back to the Qi forces. The next night, he entered the camp again and stole the general’s hairpin, returning it likewise. The following night, he went once more into the Qi camp and took the general’s robe, which Zifan again returned. The Qi messenger then warned the general, *\"You must leave tonight. If you do not, we will come for your head.\"* Terrified, the Qi general withdrew his army at once, and thus the Chu forces repelled the invasion. Even had Sun Wu commanded the Qi troops, they would have fought rather than flee at the first sign of retreat.\n\nShu Yu of Jin was the most sycophantic and wicked man in the state, yet he secured the return of Jisun. When the lord of Lu sent Jisun to pay court to the marquis of Jin, the marquis, believing Jisun guilty of an offense, arrested him before the assembled feudal lords. Later, upon investigation, no crime was found, and the marquis wished to release him. But Jisun, still bound, refused to leave, saying to the Jin ruler, *\"When you falsely arrested me, you declared before the lords that I was guilty. Now that I am proven innocent, you must gather the lords again to acknowledge my innocence before I will return. Otherwise, I will not go.\"* The marquis, ashamed, could find no way to send him back.\n\nJin had a great sycophant named Shu Yu, who feigned loyalty to Jisun. He said to him, *\"I am deeply troubled.\"* Jisun asked, *\"Why?\"* Shu Yu replied, *\"I hear the marquis has prepared a separate residence for you.\"* Jisun believed him and fled back to Lu by night. Thus, though Shu Yu was a great sycophant, he succeeded in returning Jisun. Even had Gan Su been sent to persuade him, he would have debated endlessly rather than cower in fear and flee.",

      "translated_text": "Compasses serve to model the round, yet if constrained, they deviate; squares are shaped by the carpenter’s rule, yet mirrors must reverse them. Wheels roll upon the earth, but sink in water; boats cross rivers, yet stumble on land. Why? Round and square differ in form, boats and carts in function. Though their forms differ and their uses diverge, when aptly applied, their efficacy is equal.\n\nIn scorching summer’s heat, one must seek cool winds; when ice congeals in winter’s cold, one must dwell in a warm chamber. In summer, one does not wear felt—not from hatred of it, but because heat is already excessive; in winter, one does not sleep on a rush mat—not from resentment of it, but because cold is already sufficient. One does not discard lambskin robes because spring days lengthen, nor remove woven mats because autumn dew dampens the leaves.\n\nWhen white plumes fill the field and frost-edged blades clash, civil arts yield to martial; when halberds are sheathed and rites and music flourish, martial arts yield to civil. One cannot, because the Nine Provinces are at peace, rashly abandon martial prowess, nor, when ramparts rise on every frontier, scorn the literati. Each has its season; neither can be wholly absent.\n\nThe Five Phases differ in nature, yet all serve human use; civil and martial talents differ in kind, yet both bring great benefit. Like those who fight fire—some carry basins, others pitchers, still others a single dou-measure—though their vessels vary in shape and name, in holding water to quench flames, their merit is the same. The archer leans back, the angler bends forward; though their postures differ, both gain advantage. The weaver advances step by step, the plowman retreats furrow by furrow; though their movements contrast, both complete their tasks.\n\nWhen Mozi saved Song, his feet were calloused from ceaseless travel. Mo Di, a man of Song, mastered the Nine Classics outwardly and trained ten thousand guards within. When Lu attacked Song, it sent Gongshu Ban to build cloud-ladders and assault the city. Mozi, within the walls, devised fire tools to burn the ladders. Lu exhausted its ingenuity in attacking, while Mozi’s defenses were more than sufficient. Though Gongshu Ban possessed unmatched skill, he was ultimately outmatched by Mozi. Mozi’s tireless efforts to save Song left his feet thickly calloused.\n\nGan Mu, a recluse of Wei, never left his hall. When Marquis Wen of Wei visited his home, they spoke together from dawn to dusk. The marquis’s legs grew numb, yet he dared not stretch them, saying to his attendants: “I am rich in wealth, but Gan Mu is rich in virtue. My legs dare not move.” When Qin heard that Wei had Gan Mu, it withdrew its troops and dared not attack. Though their paths differed, both preserved the state.\n\nCivil arts aid governance, martial arts subdue enemies; though their rhythms diverge, their achievements are equal. In Qin’s final years, the land crumbled like tiles and split like earth. The Han founder personally wielded a three-foot sword to plead for the people’s lives, traversing mountains and rivers, braving arrows and stones, risking a hundred deaths to secure a single life and contend for the realm. At such times, donning ceremonial caps and wide-sleeved robes was less fitting than wearing golden helmets and rhinoceros armor.\n\nAfter Xiang Yu’s defeat and the realm’s pacification, he who had founded the dynasty by force now stilled the blades with culture. He summoned scholars from Zou and Lu to establish rites and music, revived the melodies of the Six Dynasties, and assembled the myriad states in Xianyang. In that era, those who cultivated civil arts were honored, while those who practiced martial skills were briefly shamed. Within a single generation, civil and martial arts alternately rose and fell. Thus, in times of order and chaos, one must draw upon talent as the need arises.\n\nYet people of this age, if martial, disparage civil arts; if civil, mock martial skills. Each clings to their own strength and denounces the other, like those who laugh at *jue* because they favor *gong*, or reject black because they prefer white. This is neither the true nature of aptitude nor a sound judgment of reality.\n\n*Equal Employment, Twenty-Ninth*\n\nVessels have breadth and narrowness, capacities great and small, materials large and small—thus their burdens must match their appointed measure, and cannot be transgressed. A cauldron of ten thousand *shuo* cannot be filled with a ladle’s water; a bell of one *jun* cannot hold a spring’s flow. A tree of ten spans cannot be roofed with thatch; a pillar of brambles cannot support a grand hall. Why? The small is not the measure of the large, the large not the vessel of the small; the heavy is not the burden of the light, the light not the support of the heavy.\n\nTo measure the small with the large invites the fault of excess; to contain the large in the small risks overflow. To place the heavy upon the light courts breakage; to load the light with the heavy risks collapse. Thus, when the roc takes flight, its wings span the heavens, its feet tread upon clouds. Traversing the vast emptiness, it bears the azure sky upon its back—such is the power of its six pinions. *Yaoluo*, a divine steed, gallops a myriad miles in a flash of light. Its offspring, the *ji*, leaves dust in its wake, its hooves swift as the wind.\n\nYet if one were to envy the roc’s soaring speed with the wings of a sparrow, or aspire to the sun’s pace with the hooves of a sheep or dog, it is plain that such efforts cannot succeed. Thus, the bean-leaf moth cannot transform the *huozhu* worm, yet can transform the *mingling* worm. The chicken of Yue cannot hatch the eggs of a swan, yet the chicken of Lu can. Though *huozhu* and *mingling* are both insects, and the chickens of Lu and Yue both fowl, their natures differ.",

      "translated_text": "Yet whether transformation occurs or fails, whether incubation succeeds or not—such is the matter of the *huozhu*’s greatness and the Yue chicken’s smallness. The dragon and serpent possess the nature to soar and coil, thus they ride clouds and cleave to mists; the worthy and capable possess the virtue of governance, thus they ascend to power and occupy office. Though clouds and mists be dense, the ant and earthworm cannot rise, for they lack the nature; though power and office be lofty, the mediocre and blind cannot govern, for they want the virtue. Thus, petty wisdom cannot devise grand schemes, nor can narrow virtue abide in vast domains. To plot greatness with smallness invites peril; to dwell in breadth with narrowness courts ruin.\n\nWhen Ziyou governed Wucheng, Confucius sighed over the butchering of a chicken; when Yin He was appointed magistrate of a district, Zichan offered the admonition of weaving brocade. Zipi tasked Yin He with the magistracy, but Zichan, deeming his talent meager, held forth the practice of brocade-weaving, saying: *\"If one cannot yet grasp the shuttle, how can one weave brocade?\"* To assign great tasks to small virtue is called recklessness; to assign small tasks to great virtue is called demotion. Yet of these errors, demotion is preferable to recklessness. Therefore, the noble person measures talent before granting office, weighs office before conferring rank—thus the ruler makes no empty appointments, and the minister bears no hollow duties. Hence, there is no burden of mountains to bear, nor the anxiety of broken legs.\n\n**Caution in Speech, Thirty**\nThe sun and moon are the patterns of heaven; mountains and rivers, the patterns of earth; speech, the pattern of man. If the patterns of heaven are lost, there come eclipses and omens; if the patterns of earth are lost, there come landslides and droughts; if the patterns of man are lost, there come harms to the body. Thus, the mouth is the gateway of speech, and the tongue, the bolt of that gate. When the bolt moves, the gate opens; when the gate opens, speech issues forth. If speech is good, a thousand *li* respond; if speech is evil, a thousand *li* rebel. Words once uttered by oneself cannot be restrained by others; emotions aroused nearby cannot be halted afar.\n\nTherefore, the noble person guards his bolt to seal his speech. Speech in the mouth is like holding a blade—it must not be set in motion. To wield the blade injures throat and tongue; the harm of careless words is not merely that of a blade, for what it wounds is not only throat and tongue. Thus, heaven has the *Juan She* star, and man has the inscription of sealed lips. In the temple of the Duke of Zhou, a golden figure was cast with three seals upon its mouth, and on its back was inscribed: *\"I am one who guarded his speech in ancient times.\"* This serves to warn against frivolous words—*tao* means frivolous speech—and to guard the gate of speech. *Shuo* means error.\n\nThe mouth and tongue are the officials of calamity and misfortune, the storehouse of ruin and destruction. Speech is the belonging of life and fate, the tether of form and bones. Words issue forth, and disaster enters; speech is lost, and the self perishes. Once the self is lost, it cannot be restored; once words are spoken, they cannot be retrieved. It is like archery: while the trigger is yet drawn, the shot may still be halted; but once the arrow leaves the string, though one may wish to recall it, it cannot be done.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* admonishes the pivot of the trigger; the *Book of Songs* rebukes the stain of speech. Once speech is stained, no grinding or polishing can restore it; once the trigger is loosed, can lightning be recalled? These are the utmost cautions of the sages of old, the molten lessons for later generations. The wise guard their speech and thus commit no errors; the foolish speak lightly and bring about their own ruin and destruction.\n\nOf old, Zhibo carelessly spoke of flooding with water, and Han and Wei trod upon his heels. Zhibo, with Han Xuanzi and Wei Wuzi, joined to attack Zhao Xiangzi, flooding the city of Chaoge for three years. Zhibo, with the lords of Han and Wei, ascended the heights to survey the water, and in a lapse of speech said: *\"The Hong River can flood Anyi; the Fen River can flood Pingyang.\"* The two lords heard these words—Xuanzi nudged Wuzi with his elbow, and Wuzi trod upon Xuanzi’s foot. Xuanzi said to Wuzi: *\"Zhibo intends to flood us with water. If Zhao falls, we shall be next. It is better to act first.\"* The two lords then sent word to Xiangzi: *\"Tomorrow at dawn, send forth your troops to engage Zhibo in battle. Our two armies will withdraw to either side, and thus Zhibo will be destroyed.\"* Xiangzi then struck off Zhibo’s head, lacquered it, and used it as a chamber pot. Such was the consequence of careless speech.\n\nCao Cao let slip words before heroes, and Xuande lost his dagger and chopsticks. Cao Cao, at the end of the Han, when the realm was weak and the four quarters lacked a master, saw heroes rise on all sides: Yuan Shao raised troops in Guanxi, calling himself the Lord of Guannei; Sun Quan held Wu; Liu Zhang was in Shu. Cao Cao, too, sought to seize the realm. Liu Bei, styled Xuande, shared his ambition. When he came to visit Cao Cao, Cao shared a meal with him and said: *\"The heroes of the realm are only you and I. Those like Yuan Benchu are not worth counting.\"* (Benchu was Yuan Shao’s style.) Liu Bei, hearing these words, was startled in his heart, fearing Cao Cao had discerned his designs on the realm. As he ate, he dropped his dagger and chopsticks, then fled to Xu Zhou, later returning to Jing Zhou, where he overthrew Liu Zhang and proclaimed himself King of Shu. Cao Cao became King of Wei, Sun Quan King of Wu, and the realm was divided into the Three Kingdoms. Thus, heads became chamber pots, Xu Zhou was partitioned, the two Jin lands were carved up, Shu perished in defeat, and long-standing enmities became the realm’s laughter—all from careless speech.\n\nKing Zhao of Han slept alone through the night after plotting with Lord Gong of Tangxi. King Zhao of Han, a marquis by rank, conferred with Lord Gong of Tangxi (Tangxi being a place, and \"Gong\" his title). Lord Gong of Tangxi said to the king: *\"For a ruler, words leaked to his attendants are like jade and silk placed before wine.\"* The king of Han then slept alone through the night, fearing his dream-words might be revealed to his wives and concubines. He feared his words in dreams might be overheard.\n\nKong Guang would not name the trees of the Warm Chamber, lest his words be leaked to his attendants.",

      "translated_text": "**Valuing Unity and Rarity, Chapter Thirty-One**\n\nA Yue sword, sharp by nature, must rely on hammer and anvil to become a flawless hook; a Chu bow, stiff in quality, must depend on a straightening frame to form a perfect bow. The *fangqing* is a tool for crafting arrows, used to correct the bow’s curve and straighten what is bent. Thus is the *dangong* made. The *huagong* is the bow used by the Son of Heaven.\n\nThough human nature may be keen, it must rely on wise words to cultivate virtue and conduct. Thus, the hammer and anvil smooth what is uneven, the straightening frame corrects what is crooked, and wise words rectify what is unvirtuous.\n\nThe eye is short-sighted in seeing itself, so it borrows a mirror to observe its form; the hair is clumsy in arranging itself, so it must rely on a comb to set it in order; the heart is blind to its own faults, so it must depend on words to guide its actions. The face is made clear by the power of the mirror; the hair is made orderly by the work of the comb; conduct is made honorable by the benefit of wise words.\n\nA mirror and comb groom the form—this favor is light. Wise words perfect virtue—this favor is weighty. Yet people delight in a mirror’s clarity of their appearance but do not admire a scholar’s clarity of their heart; they desire a comb to arrange their hair but do not wish for wise words to order their nature. This is to discard weighty virtue and pursue light merit—is this not inverted?\n\nOne who wears robes and caps, if unable to make them with their own hands, knows to seek others to craft them. Yet when it comes to ordering their own conduct, they do not know to borrow words to refine their actions—is this not to treat the body lightly and robes heavily? Is this not absurd?\n\nThe gentleman values the favor of upright words more than gifts of carriages and jade; he delights in hearing his faults more than the fame of virtue and righteousness. Thus, King Zhuang of Chu slighted a thousand-chariot state but prized a single word from Shen Shu. When Chen Zhengshu caused chaos and killed the lord of Chen, King Zhuang of Chu led troops to Chen, killed Zhengshu, and intended to make Chen a commandery, appointing his own son to govern it. His minister Shen Shu admonished him: *\"Now that you have punished Zhengshu for Chen, you wish to make its land a commandery and have your son rule it. When the feudal lords hear of this, they will not say you punished evil for Chen but will claim you coveted its land and killed Zhengshu. Why not send envoys abroad to seek Chen’s descendants and establish one as its ruler to govern the state?\"* The king followed his advice, found a descendant, and enthroned him.\n\nFan Xian valued a boatman’s brief counsel over ten thousand *mu* of land. Fan Xian, a minister of Jin, had killed the grandee Yue You and feared revenge from Yue You’s son. While traveling, he asked a boatman: *\"Have you seen Yue You’s son?\"* The boatman replied: *\"Return to Jin and govern its laws well. Even if Yue You’s son lives, what can he do? But if you come and go without restraint and neglect the state’s governance, then everyone in this boat is no different from Yue You’s son. Why ask after him?\"* Fan Xian then granted the boatman ten thousand *mu* of land to honor his brief counsel.\n\nJi Lu embraced the Five Admonitions, and Zhao Meng treasured the Nine Sayings. The *zhen* is a remembrance, nine words in length. Its precepts are: do not revile in chaos, do not indulge in excess, do not rely on favor, do not echo blindly, do not transgress ritual, do not feign ability, do not pardon indiscriminately, do not punish without virtue, do not violate what is unjust.\n\nFrom this, can carriages and jade, fields and cities, compare in value to wise words?\n\nWhen Duke Huan of Qi ignored the advice of the Yue man, he ultimately suffered from a bone-marrow illness. The Yue man was Bian Que. When he entered Qi and saw the duke was ill, he said: *\"Your illness can be cured.\"* The duke replied: *\"Old physicians take the absence of symptoms as proof of their skill.\"* Bian Que departed. The next day, he saw the duke again and said: *\"Your illness can be treated.\"* The duke replied: *\"There is no illness to treat.\"* Later, when Bian Que came again, he fled. After Bian Que left, the duke’s condition worsened, and he sent men to find him, wishing to have his illness treated. Bian Que returned and said: *\"When I first saw you, your illness was in the skin—acupuncture could have cured it. Next, it was in the muscles and blood—herbal medicine could have cured it. Later, it reached beneath the fat and membrane—this illness cannot be treated. That is why I left.\"* The duke said: *\"This is a truly good physician.\"* He sent him off with gifts, but the duke soon died.\n\nKing Fuchai of Wu did not heed Mei Cheng’s words and ultimately suffered annihilation. Mei Cheng was a minister of the King of Wu and the father of Mei Gao. When the king of Wu rebelled, Mei Cheng admonished him, but the king ignored his words and thus brought ruin upon his state.\n\nOne who is about to fall ill no longer savors the taste of fish and meat; one whose state is about to collapse no longer accepts loyal remonstrance. Thus, the dying say there are no good physicians to blame, and the ruined say there are no forthright ministers. To not listen to wise words is deafness—not because the ears are blocked, but because wise words do not enter them.\n\nTherefore, the wise accept admonition before trouble takes shape, gather counsel at the first sign of peril, follow goodness as smoothly as a turning wheel, and shun evil as if fleeing a cliff. Upright words ring in the ears, and calamity distances itself from the body.\n\nIn ancient times, Emperor Yao set up a drum for remostrance, Shun erected a pillar for slander, Tang appointed officers to oversee faults, and King Wu established the *jieshen* hairpin. The *tao* is a small drum, shaken while suspended. With the divine insight of sages, who perceive the subtlest workings without the slightest error, they still established broad means of listening and opened paths for worthy words. How could they not have left this example for later generations to show the benefit of upright speech?\n\nIf even the former sages could gather counsel from the humblest sources, how much more should common men value words?",

Between friends of profound understanding, there is also the duty of mutual refinement through earnest exchange.

The extolling of goodness arises from an inherently noble nature; the broadcasting of evil stems from a perverse disposition. A noble disposition naturally seeks to perfect things, while a perverse one is bent on harming others. Thus, when praise is used to discuss virtue, its merit lies in exhausting all that is good; when slander exaggerates faults, its cunning lies in exhausting all that is evil. Why is this so? The common crowd delights in the extraordinary—without it, they take no interest. If praise does not amplify a person’s virtues, the listener’s heart remains unsatisfied; if slander does not magnify another’s faults, the hearer’s ears remain unfilled. Since good people are few and the wicked many, those who praise fall silent while slanderers clamor.\n\nThus, they wash clean to seek stains, blow on fur to find flaws, conjure something from nothing, turn white into black, inflate the trivial to the weighty, and stretch an inch into a foot. This is why Mozi wept over undyed silk—Mozi being Mo Di—grieving that silkworms’ threads, originally pure white, are dyed and change color, becoming blue or yellow. So too are good people, when slandered, turned to evil. This is why Yang Zhu wept at the fork in the road—Yang Zhu, a man of Song. Traveling with others, he would suddenly wail upon seeing a crossroads, lamenting how many had taken the wrong path, for once turned, blue and yellow become indistinguishable, left and right confused.\n\nIn ancient times, slander was likened to the green fly, as when Duke Wu of Wei believed calumny and was satirized in verse: *\"Buzzing green flies alight on the fence; how can a gracious lord be so credulous?\"* Slander is like the green fly that stains white to black. It is compared to a sharp blade, for it stains purity with darkness—*zi* meaning the color of ink—and a knife’s edge wounds all it touches. Thus, there are four fears one must guard against: birds with crooked necks and taloned feet are feared by their feathered kin; beasts with hooked beaks and curved claws are feared by their furred kind; fish with serrated lips and jagged teeth are feared by their scaled fellows; and people with sharp tongues and slanderous flattery are feared by all.\n\nThe slanderous and envious invariably delight in hearing of others’ faults and detest hearing of their virtues. If another’s talent and wisdom surpass their own, or if wealth and rank exceed theirs, it is as though a lump lodges in their throat, choking their desire to swallow, or a film clouds their eyes, longing to be removed. The deeper this choking resentment, the more florid their slanderous words become. Thus, those who enhance their beauty are resented by ugly women, and those who conduct themselves with integrity are envied by the slanderous and perverse.\n\nIn former times, Zhi Buyi had no elder brother, yet slanderers accused him of seducing his sister-in-law. Zhi Buyi was a man of the Former Han. At that time, slander spread the tale of his pursuing a sister-in-law. Since he had never had a brother, how could he have a sister-in-law to seduce?",

      "translated_text": "Fifth Lun married three times, each to an orphaned girl, yet the world secretly accused him of striking his father-in-law. Fifth Lun was a man of the Later Han. He married three orphaned girls, but slanderers claimed he had once struck his father-in-law. This is to heed the hollow and demand an echo, to gaze at emptiness and seek a shadow—perverse in sentiment, inverted in reason, and utterly deceitful.\n\nThough these two men were virtuous, their conduct neither impure nor offensive to others, they could not escape the world’s slander. Is this not like beasts hating the hunter’s net or men resenting those above them? Thus, the obstruction of the good by slanderous deceit is like the bright morning sun obscured by dense fog, so that heaven cannot be seen; or like the purest sand and stone rendered invisible by muddy currents, so that earth cannot be seen. Though their nature is luminous and pure, it cannot shine forth, for mist and haze veil it. The autumn wind blights the thriving orchid and sweet flag, just as slanderers ruin the upright and wise.\n\nSlanderers know only how to harm and envy others, not how their words wound the one they flatter; they know how their words wound the one they flatter, yet do not realize they bring ruin upon themselves. Thus, the boundless slander of Wuji brought false blame upon Zichang, and both perished together. Wuji, surnamed Fei, was a man of Chu and a grandee of Jin. Zichang, surnamed You, was also a grandee of Jin, serving alongside Wuji. When the Lord of Jin wished to visit Zichang’s home, Wuji deceived Zichang, saying: “The Lord of Jin loves fine troops and horses. Tomorrow he will come to your house—you should station elite soldiers within your gates.” Zichang believed him and arrayed his troops inside the gate to await the Lord of Jin’s arrival. When the Lord of Jin indeed arrived at Zichang’s gate, Wuji said to him: “One must be aware of affairs. Let your servant enter first to scout.” Wuji went inside, then emerged to report: “Zichang has readied elite troops within his gates, intending to ambush you.” Enraged, the Lord of Jin had Zichang put to death. After Zichang’s execution, another informed him that it was Wuji’s scheme, and the Lord of Jin then executed Wuji as well. Thus it is said: Zichang was falsely blamed, and both You and Fei perished. Such is the ruin wrought by the tide of slander and flattery.\n\nAlas! Let gentlemen of later generations take heed.",

      "translated_text": "**Vigilance in Formation, Thirty-Third**\n\nFaults are the ladder of resentment; resentment is the storehouse of misfortune. The nature of misfortune necessarily arises from accumulated resentment; the origin of faults often lies in neglecting the small. Small faults arise beyond expectation; accumulated resentment takes shape beyond foresight. Thus, when it comes, it cannot be regretted; when it forms, it cannot be guarded against. If one fails to guard against resentment with care, calamity will soon arrive.\n\nTherefore, one who climbs a steep cliff without falling is cautious in great matters; one who stumbles over an anthill or a mound of earth—where a single inch of piled soil is called a *feng*—is careless in small ones. If one treads with vigilance, even a treacherous path may be traversed safely; if one moves with recklessness, even a level road may cause a fall. The wise recognize the harm in slight and small things, thus they are cautious of minute dangers, ever wary and reverent, as if driving a galloping horse with a rotting rope.\n\nA swan-goose’s nature is light, yet accumulation sinks a boat; fine silk is delicate, yet layering breaks an axle. That such light and subtle things as silk can capsize a boat or snap an axle is due to their accumulation. Thus, a wall collapses because of its decay; a sword breaks because of its flaws. A worm of a foot’s length can bore through a dike and flood a town; a wisp of smoke from a chimney’s crack can reduce a thousand homes to ash.\n\nThe beginning of resentment is subtler than decay or flaws, yet its harm is greater than that of a collapsing wall or a broken sword. The damage wrought by misfortune exceeds that of a town or a house—guarding against its sprouts is more urgent than preventing water or fire.\n\nThe *Book of Xia* states: *\"Resentment need not be overt; what is unseen must be heeded.\"* Thus, resentment does not lie in heaven, nor does it lie in the small. A spark, if unextinguished, can burn Mount Kunlun; a trickle, if unchecked, can become the Yangtze or the Yellow River. The birth of resentment cannot be inferred by analogy; the spread of misfortune cannot be guessed.\n\nSome resentments are great yet result in little; some grievances are slight yet lead to grave consequences. What seems profound may not be perilous, while what appears trivial must not be taken lightly. It is like the wind: a gale may tear through clouds, hurl stones, churn waters, and uproot trees, yet leave a man’s blood and pulse unharmed; but the wind from a rat’s burrow, stirring not even dust, ruffling not a hair, may yet penetrate the flesh and become a deep affliction. The great does not harm, while the small becomes a calamity—because the great wind scatters, while the small wind strikes with precision.\n\nThus, the Han founder pardoned Guan Gao’s treachery—Guan Gao, minister to the King of Zhao, who plotted to assassinate the emperor at Zhiren Pavilion.",

      "translated_text": "The High Ancestor arrived at Xiangren Pavilion intending to rest, but his heart stirred uneasily. He asked his attendants the name of the pavilion. They replied, \"This is Zhiren Pavilion.\" The High Ancestor said, \"Zhiren Pavilion—it means ‘to obstruct and press upon a man.’\" Thereupon, he fled swiftly under cover of night and thus escaped Guan Gao’s harm.\n\nLater, someone informed the High Ancestor: \"Guan Gao plotted to kill you at Zhiren Pavilion.\" Guan Gao’s followers, twenty in all, all took their own lives. Guan Gao said, \"If we all die together, no one will be left to prove the King of Zhao’s innocence.\" Thereupon, one man reported this to the High Ancestor. The High Ancestor had Guan Gao thrown into prison, where the jailers flogged him over a thousand lashes. Yet Guan Gao never falsely confessed, insisting that the King of Zhao had not rebelled. The High Ancestor then questioned him personally and verified the truth. Guan Gao thus informed the High Ancestor that the King of Zhao had not rebelled, whereupon the High Ancestor released Guan Gao and also pardoned him. Guan Gao said, \"I sought to kill Your Majesty—how could I face eating another’s salary or serving as another’s minister?\" He then dug a pit and died in it.\n\nLater Wei’s ruler vented his grudge against Zhang Xiu. This \"later Wei ruler\" was Cao Cao, who contended with Yuan Shao for supremacy over the realm. Zhang Xiu was a general under Yuan Shao who clashed with Cao Cao in battle and captured Cao Cao’s beloved son, whom he then executed. After Yuan Shao’s defeat, his forces scattered, and Zhang Xiu came to surrender to Cao Cao. Xu Chu said to him, \"You should flee to Wu instead.\" Zhang Xiu replied, \"I cannot.\" Xu Chu asked, \"Why not?\" \"You killed his beloved son—how can you surrender to him?\" Zhang Xiu said, \"Lord Cao is a man of great ambition, one who can unite the realm under his rule. I killed his son—this was my private grievance. Later, he will also swallow Wu. Can a true man endure repeated humiliation?\" He then surrendered to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao captured Zhang Xiu, he pointed at his face and said, \"It is you who have made me establish great trust throughout the world.\" He appointed Zhang Xiu as a general and absolved him of his former crimes. *Xie* means \"to leak\" or \"to conceal\"—he concealed Zhang Xiu’s past offenses.\n\nHan Xin avenged the humiliation of his youth. Han Xin was a man of Huaiyin who neither pursued a livelihood nor provided for even a single meal. He liked to wear a long sword in the Huaiyin marketplace. A young man insulted him, saying, \"You wear a long sword—can you kill a man? If you can, then kill me. If you cannot, then crawl between my legs.\" Han Xin looked at the young man for a long time, then calculated that killing him would bring no benefit. He bent down and crawled between the young man’s legs. Later, the High Ancestor appointed him Grand General. Han Xin summoned the young man from the marketplace and said to him, \"You humiliated me in the past—can you humiliate me today?\" The young man begged for his life, and Han Xin pardoned his offense, appointing him to a minor post.\n\nAn Guo forgave Tian Jia’s insolence. An Guo was Han Anguo, who served as Grand Scribe of Liang. He was imprisoned for an offense, and the jailer Tian Jia insulted him. Anguo said, \"Can cold ashes still burn?\" Tian Jia replied, \"If cold ashes should flare up, I will piss on them.\" Later, Anguo was released and appointed Inspector of Liang Province. The jailer Tian Jia fled in terror. Anguo said, \"If you flee, I will exterminate your clan. If you do not flee, I will pardon your crime.\" Tian Jia then appeared before Anguo. Anguo laughed and said to him, \"The cold ashes burn today—why do you not piss on them?\" Tian Jia, ashamed of his former offense, trembled uncontrollably. Anguo then appointed him to the office of Minister of Justice, which is today’s position of Marshal.\n\nAll these men encountered wise and magnanimous rulers, whose broad-mindedness allowed deep resentments to be set aside rather than avenged.\n\nLu’s thin wine led to the siege of Dengye. During the time of the Six States, when Chu was hegemonic, the feudal lords all came to pay court to the King of Chu. The King of Zhao also came to pay court, presenting cattle and wine. The King of Zhao’s wine was fine, and the King of Chu’s officials came to request some. The King of Zhao refused, saying, \"This wine has not yet been offered to the King of Chu, so I cannot give it.\" The officials then took the wine intended for the King of Zhao, and in its place substituted the thin wine of the Marquis of Lu. They presented it to the king, saying, \"This is the King of Zhao’s thin wine.\" The King of Chu drank it and grew furious: \"To arrive late is to slight me once; to offer thin wine is to slight me twice.\" When the assembly of feudal lords dispersed, he raised an army and besieged Dengye, which was the King of Zhao’s city.\n\nThe uneven distribution of mutton stew led to the defeat of Song’s army. The state of Song sent Hua Yuan to lead troops against Zheng. The next day, they were to join battle, so Hua Yuan slaughtered sheep to make stew for a feast with his officers. His charioteer, Yang Zhen, did not receive any stew. The next day, when they fought Zheng, Yang Zhen said to Hua Yuan, \"Yesterday, you decided the stew; today, I decide the battle.\" He then drove Hua Yuan’s chariot into the Zheng army, and the Song forces suffered a great defeat. Hua Yuan was captured by Zheng. The people of Song ransomed him with gold, silver, and precious treasures. They said to Yang Zhen, \"When the chariot charged into Zheng the other day, it was because the horses bolted and you could not restrain them.\" They spoke thus to avoid punishing Yang Zhen.\n\nQiu Sun lost his life over a state-owned rooster. Hou Zhaobo and Ji Pingzi held a cockfight. Pingzi had golden spurs made for his rooster, while Zhaobo sprinkled mustard-seed powder on his rooster’s wings. When the powder flew into Pingzi’s rooster’s eyes, it retreated. Later, Pingzi learned of this and reproached Qiu Sun, saying, \"Why did you sprinkle mustard-seed powder on your rooster’s wings, causing it to get into my rooster’s eyes?\" Zhaobo replied, \"Why did you put golden spurs on your rooster?\" Each grew furious, and they raised armies to fight for several days. Pingzi then killed Zhaobo.\n\nThe Marquis of Qi lost his state over a laughing concubine. The state of Jin sent the grandee You Ke as an envoy to Qi.",

      "translated_text": "You Ke’s foot was lame. The Marquis of Qi wished to mock him, so he set up a curtain in the corridor and had his concubines watch from behind it. As You Ke limped up to the hall, the concubines all burst into laughter at once. Enraged by their mockery, You Ke returned to Jin and led an army to attack Qi, ultimately destroying the state of Qi.\n\nThese were all trivial matters that brought ruin to states and death to men—light scorn and petty grudges that sowed the seeds of disaster. Over food, drink, jest, and laughter, they lost their nations and their lives, becoming laughingstocks for all under Heaven, perishing through their own carelessness.\n\nBetween generations, people often bring great calamity upon themselves through small, seemingly insignificant matters. Disaster arises from human actions, just as good fortune is shaped by human deeds. Misfortune and blessing share the same door; harm and benefit dwell as neighbors. Without the utmost discernment, none can distinguish between them.\n\nThus, wisdom and foresight are the gateways to fortune and misfortune; movement and stillness are the pivots of benefit and harm. One cannot afford to be careless.\n\n**Admonition Against Fullness, Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe seasons reach their peak and then fade; the Five Phases fulfill their functions and then retreat. Thus, when yang reaches its extreme, yin descends; when yin reaches its extreme, yang rises. The sun at its zenith begins to decline; the moon at its fullness begins to wane—this is the constant Way of Heaven.\n\nThe sun at noon inclines westward; the moon at fullness wanes; men who boast and overreach perish; vessels that are full spill over. Hence, this chapter is aptly named *Admonition Against Fullness*.\n\nPower accumulates and then diminishes; wealth gathers and then scatters; youthful vigor turns to decline; joy at its peak reverts to sorrow—such is the unchanging pattern.\n\nOf old, Confucius observed a singing vessel and changed his expression. In the temple of the Duke of Zhou stood a sacrificial vessel that was always tilted and unstable, called the *Respectful Vessel*. When too full, it would tip; when not full, it would still lean; only when level would it stand upright. Confucius, seeing it in the temple of the Duke of Zhou, asked the keeper of the vessel, \"What is this vessel called?\" The keeper replied, \"The Respectful Vessel.\" Confucius said, \"I have heard that the Respectful Vessel tips when too full, leans when not full, and stands upright only when level.\" Thereupon, he sighed and adjusted his demeanor, saying, \"The ancients crafted this to admonish later generations, teaching them to be wary of fullness and excess, that each may remain within their proper measure.\"\n\nHe observed gain and loss and sighed; he examined images and recognized patterns; he saw frost and knew ice would follow.\n\nThose who know how to advance but not retreat tread the perilous path of overflowing fullness. Those who dwell in existence without courting danger walk the secure ground of Mount Tai. Thus, thunder in the heavens is called *Great Strength*; a mountain within the earth is called *Modesty*. Modesty gathers the many to reduce the few; strength refrains from treading where ritual does not permit.\n\nTo abide in strength yet employ ritual, to dwell in modesty yet gain benefit, to descend from heights to approach the lowly, to restrain the strong to align with the weak—none who embrace reduction fail to shine, and none who are arrogant and full avoid destruction.\n\nThe sage knows the difficulty of relying on fullness and prosperity, so he always dwells in virtue with humility and emptiness. Though wise and discerning, his aspirations grow ever lower; though wealthy and exalted, his heart grows ever more yielding; though his merits cover all under Heaven, his spirit remains ever vigilant. He does not pride himself on his abundant virtue nor lord his lofty position over the people.\n\nThus, King Zhuang of Chu, though his achievements were established, remained fearful in heart; Duke Wen of Jin, though victorious in battle, wore a troubled countenance. They did not hate glory or despise victory but understood that great merit demands a small heart, and dwelling in safety requires mindfulness of danger.\n\nYu of Xia, though wearing but a single hempen sash, rose seven times to receive guests; the Duke of Zhou, though washing his hair but once, grasped it three times to greet visitors. He ate without time to be full, bathed without time to dry his hair—not because he endured hunger or delighted in toil, but because he was eager to receive scholars and abided in humble radiance.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says, \"The noble one, though exalted, lowers himself to the humble, and thus greatly wins the people.\" Therefore, the noble person, though high, can be lowly; though rich, can be frugal; though noble, can be base; though wise, can be foolish; though brave, can be timid; though eloquent, can be reticent; though learned, can be shallow; though perceptive, can be dull—this is called \"reducing yet never exhausted.\"\n\n**Illuminating Modesty, Chapter Thirty-Five**\nThe Way of Heaven descends and shines with light; rivers and lakes flow downward and become kings. Thus, a mountain within the earth forms modesty, and kings and lords take \"orphaned\" and \"widowed\" as their titles of reduction.\n\nModesty brings honor and ever-greater height; reduction brings distinction and ever-greater nobility. Height must take the low as its foundation; nobility must take the base as its root. Forgetting one’s nobility while in a noble position enables one to lower oneself to the people; forgetting one’s height while in a high position enables one to descend to the lowly.\n\nThus, when *Great Strength* advances, it reverts to the modesty of Heaven and Earth; when ascent reaches its extreme, it descends to the modesty of yin and yang; when fullness ends, it wanes to the modesty of the sun and moon; when the Dao is full, the sage embodies emptiness.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states that modesty is honored and shines ever brighter; the *Laozi* says that one does not boast. Thus, the modest person, though accomplished, lowers himself; though high, follows the lowly; though sagely, follows the vulgar.\n\nNot boasting lies in having merit; not priding oneself lies in having virtue; not speaking of one’s goodness belongs to the stream of emptiness, retreat, and humble embrace.\n\nTo delight in fullness and consider oneself worthy, to boast of merit and flaunt goodness—these are the common tendencies of the world, but the sage detests them.\n\nIf one must boast of merit, even if rewarded and praised for one’s labor, the heart remains unsatisfied. If one flaunts one’s goodness, even if granted great rewards, one will resent their insufficiency. Thus, resentment and expectation arise, the demeanor of restlessness and competition appears, the path of boasting and flaunting opens, and the seeds of calamity and disaster are sown.\n\nThe noble person is not thus. In glory, he takes embracing reduction as his foundation; with merit, he does not boast; with goodness, he does not flaunt. He forgets his merit, yet his merit endures; he forgets his goodness, yet his goodness remains whole.\n\nWhen the heart constantly forgets goodness, one can use goodness to gauge others; when the heart constantly dwells on goodness, one desires to use goodness to surpass others.\n\nThus, if the heart dwells on merit and goodness, it is not truly modest; if the mouth feigns modesty, is it not hypocritical? To use goodness to surpass others while forgetting merit and goodness is not boasting or flaunting; to speak of one’s goodness is not necessarily insincere.\n\nTherefore, if the heart dwells on merit and goodness, it is not truly modest. Though the mouth may not speak, it does not escape boasting and flaunting. If the heart lets go of merit and goodness, though the mouth may speak of them, it does no harm to integrity.\n\nThus, Yu of Xia openly proclaimed and praised his merits, while Gao Yao, in expounding his plans, said, \"Tell me of my kindness.\"",

Pingzi then killed Zhaobo.\n\nThe Marquis of Qi lost his state over a laughing concubine. The state of Jin sent the grandee You Ke as an envoy to Qi.",

      "translated_text": "How could it be that they boasted of merit while preserving kindness? Those who speak of goodness not to flaunt it yet flaunt their goodness invariably praise their own abilities; those who speak of kindness not to boast of it yet boast of their kindness invariably cling to their kindness. The sages, knowing that human nature exalts worthiness and delights in self-promotion, thus tempered their words with restraint and often deferred in humility, thereby casting aside arrogance and vainglory to set an example for the world.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Great Essence**\n\nFire’s nature is such that in the bitter cold, when frost chills the air, ice splits the earth, yet its blazing qi does not wane; in scorching heat, when walls glow red and metals melt, yet its blazing qi does not intensify. Why is this? It possesses its natural essence, and the cold cannot alter it. Thus, cinnabar may be ground but cannot be stripped of its color; orchids may be trampled but cannot be robbed of their fragrance; jade may be shattered but cannot be changed in its whiteness; gold may be melted but cannot be softened in its hardness. Each embraces its natural nature, which cannot be forcibly transformed.\n\nScholars, too, possess the nature of loyalty and righteousness, holding fast to integrity and unyielding resolve—an unchanging essence like these. Thus, if in life they turn from the Dao, they do not consider it gain; if in death they align with righteousness, they do not deem it harm. Therefore, they do not chase profit to flee harm, nor do they heed life and regret death. They cannot be swayed by threats to alter their principles, nor can they be enticed by gain to change their hearts.\n\nIn the past, when Zixi was threatened, blades were leveled at him, yet his heart did not waver. When the rebel Bai Gongsheng of Chu killed Zixi and seized Zixi, he said, \"Those who side with me will be spared; those who oppose me will be killed.\" He brandished a blade to stab Zixi, yet Zixi still refused to comply. Thus it is said: they do not flee harm by chasing profit.\n\nWhen Yan Ying was forced to swear allegiance, a hooked halberd was pressed against his neck, yet his will did not falter. After Cui Zhu killed the Lord of Qi, he had men use an iron hook to drag Yan Ying by the neck, demanding he swear an oath. Yet Yan Ying ultimately refused to join Cui Zhu’s rebellion. He could not be swayed by profit or harm.\n\nScholars of loyalty and righteousness, who uphold the standards of conduct, may appear no different from others in their actions. Yet when they face peril and tread danger, their resolve and fortitude reveal their distinction. It is like the jade of Mount Zhong—Mount Zhong being in Kuaiji—and the pines of cold peaks: compared to common mulberry, catalpa, or willow, they seem no different. Yet when placed in fire, jade-like stones melt, while true jade, though burned in a furnace for three days, does not change color; though submerged in deep waters for a year, its branches and leaves do not wither. Only then is its difference from other jades and trees known.\n\nThus, courage is roused only when one strips bare and grapples with a tiger; swiftness is revealed only when one leaps over perilous chasms; strength is proven only when one lifts ten thousand *jun*; and steadfast courage emerges only when one endures hardship and faces peril. One need not wield the *Ganjiang* sword to know its sharpness, nor draw the *Wuhao* bow to know its power. (The *Wuhao* was a bow made from the wood of the angle mulberry. Before the Yellow Emperor’s palace stood a mulberry tree with long branches where crows perched. When the crows took flight, the branches would rebound and strike them, causing them to cry out—hence the name *Wuhao*. The Yellow Emperor, seeing this, said, \"This wood must be fit for use.\" He took it to make a bow, which proved exceptionally fine, thus called the *Wuhao* bow. The *Shuowen* states: On Mount Dinghu, the Yellow Emperor received a divine bow left by an immortal; when his ministers saw it, they wailed in unison, hence the name *Wuhao* bow. Another account says that on Mount Nanling grew a *tuo* tree where crows cried daily, and thus the bow made from it was called *Wuhao*.)\n\nThe qualities of strength and sharpness are readily apparent, yet they become known only through human use. Loyalty and righteousness, however, are difficult to perceive until death—how could they not be revealed only through deeds?\n\n*End of Scroll Seven of the Liuzi*\n\n*(Textual notes: \"知\" was originally \"之,\" amended per the Wenyuan Ge edition. \"五\" was originally \"云,\" amended per the Wenyuan Ge edition.

      "translated_text": "The Annotations of Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou Prefecture: \"On Discerning Generosity\" (Chapter Thirty-Seven)\n\nMountains and hills do not plant forests for crows, yet when the forests flourish, crows naturally roost there. Rivers and lakes do not carve deep pools for fish, yet when the pools run deep, fish naturally return to them. In life, one does not accumulate wealth for others, yet when wealth is amassed, others naturally depend on it—this is not by summoning, but by the force of circumstance.\n\nA youth bearing jade may not necessarily be kind, yet people vie to befriend him, for he possesses the means to benefit others. A scholar clad in coarse cloth may by nature scorn wealth, yet all keep their distance from him, for he lacks the means to benefit others. Now, the rich who are frugal are still treated with intimacy and respect, while the poor who practice benevolence are inevitably met with neglect and disdain—not because their conduct is flawed, but because their circumstances alter how they are perceived.\n\nDriving a team of four up a mountain, one cannot proceed with reins held straight; sailing a boat into the sea, one cannot sit at ease. Why? The mountain path winds, the sea’s waters surge with waves: the traveler wishes to go straight, but the path curves; the sitter wishes to be at rest, but the water sways. The benevolent wish to give, but poverty restrains them. When wealthy, bestowing aid is not difficult; when poor and miserly, the conduct is not blameworthy.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven diminishes excess; the nature of man pities insufficiency. Beneath Mount Kun, jade is cast to crows; along the shores of Lake Pengli, fish are fed to dogs—yet no one begrudges this, not because they scorn wealth by nature, but because abundance permits it. Carrying a jar to beg for water, clutching straw to seek fire, or gathering grass resembling *longxu* to weave into mats—people use such things to fuel their stoves. Yet no one marvels at this, not because they delight in generosity by nature, but because surplus allows it.\n\nThe mouth is not a gourd that need not eat; the body is not wood or stone that need not be clothed. If food does not fill the belly, how can one cease eating to benefit others? If clothing does not cover the body, how can one bare oneself to give to others? This is not frugality by nature, but insufficiency at work.\n\nIn famine-stricken springs, one does not relieve even kin; in years of abundant harvest, one feasts neighbors far and wide. Failing to aid kin is deemed wicked; bestowing upon neighbors is deemed virtuous. Yet good and evil conduct arise from nature but are shaped by hunger and plenty.\n\nFrom this, we see: when too abundant, kindness and affection arise; when destitute, benevolence and generosity wither. Poverty is the culprit.\n\nThose who judge horses err when they seek a thousand-mile stride in a gaunt steed—this is deficiency. Those who judge men err when they expect generosity from the poor—this is lack. Men who scorn wealth are not rare in the world, yet they go unseen, for poverty obscures them.\n\nTo claim ability before one’s virtue is manifest is like a cripple selling ointment for calluses—hoping others will believe is truly difficult.\n\n\"On Harmonizing Nature\" (Chapter Thirty-Eight)\n\nWhen Ou Ye forged swords...",

      "translated_text": "The swordsmith of King Goujian of Yue, surnamed Zhao and named Ganjiang, was skilled in the art of Ou Ye’s sword-casting. If a blade is too hard, it snaps; if too soft, it bends. To prevent snapping, tin must be added; to prevent bending, metal must be added. Why? Metal is hard by nature, while tin is soft; when hardness and softness are balanced, the blade is excellent. A master craftsman applies lacquer: if too slow, it fails to dry; if too hasty, it does not adhere. Only when the pace is even and harmonized does it become perfect.\n\nHuman nature is much the same. Those who are too hard harm by severity; those who are too soft falter in weakness. Those who are too slow regret missing opportunities; those who are too hasty fail through impatience. Thus, the swordsmith ensures the metal does not snap and the tin does not bend; the artisan ensures slowness does not hinder drying and haste does not weaken adhesion; the cultivator of nature ensures hardness does not become harshness, softness does not become cowardice, slowness does not miss opportunities, and haste does not lead to recklessness. Only then can both blade and vessel excel, and one’s nature and qi achieve pure harmony.\n\nIn ancient times, King Yan of Xu perished because his softness led to the ruin of his state. King Yan of Xu, a prince of that land, was fond of practicing benevolence and virtue, diligently cultivating civil power, but neglected military preparedness. Later, he was conquered by a neighboring state. At the moment of his death, he said, “I only knew how to practice civil virtue and did not realize others could be deceitful.” Duke Shang of Qi died because his cowardice brought about his own demise—this was the fault of excessive softness. Yang Chufu of Jin was undone by his sheer hardness. Yang Chufu, a grandee of Jin surnamed Yang, was of an extremely hard nature and was later killed by the ruler of Jin. Ziyang of Zheng met his end through excessive severity. The lord of Zheng was of an extremely severe and harsh nature and was slain by his ministers—this was the fault of excessive hardness. Zixi of Chu invited defeat through his overindulgence. The Prime Minister of Chu was of a lenient nature and was killed by the King of Chu. Duke Zhuang of Yan brought disaster upon himself through his impatience—this was the calamity of a hasty and narrow disposition.\n\nXimen Bao, quick-tempered, wore soft leather to temper his haste. Ximen Bao, a magistrate of Ye during the Warring States period, was of a hasty nature and wore soft leather to restrain himself. The leather was too pliant, so he wore it to moderate his disposition. Dong Anyu, slow by nature, girded himself with a silk rope to quicken his pace. Dong Anyu, governor of Jinyang, was of a slow nature. Each used one thing to remedy their shortcomings.\n\nThus, when yin and yang are harmonized, heaven and earth are in accord; when hardness and softness are balanced, human nature is in harmony. If yin and yang are not in harmony, floods and droughts lose their proper season; if hardness and softness are not balanced, strength and weakness disrupt governance. When floods and droughts lose their season, the year is ruined; when strength and weakness disrupt governance, the self is destroyed. Therefore, the wise are tolerant yet vigilant, stern yet warm, gentle yet resolute, fierce yet benevolent, hard yet tempered by softness. They restrain their strength with softness, blend strength and weakness, and balance slowness and haste. Through this cultivation of nature, no regret or misfortune arises from external things.\n\n\"On Divergent Preferences\" (Chapter Thirty-Nine)\n\nLofty pavilions and cavernous chambers, pearl curtains and jade halls—these delight men, yet birds entering them grow anxious. Towering crags and jagged cliffs, tangled vines and knotted roots—these suit the warmth-loving Di, yet men climbing them tremble. The Five Discourses and Six Classics, the *Xianchi* and *Xiaoshao* melodies—these bring joy to men, yet beasts hearing them shudder. Cascading rapids and emerald pools, surging waves and swirling eddies—these comfort fish and dragons, yet men entering them fear. Flying squirrels relish roasted meat; running beasts delight in iron; hong chickens crave snakes; men favor grain-fed livestock. Birds and beasts differ from men in nature and form, their habitats and preferences distinct—this is no cause for wonder.\n\nMen and beasts alike receive the qi of the Two Modes and embrace the Five Constants. Though the wise and foolish differ in disposition, the good and evil in conduct, when it comes to seeing the sun and moon, hearing thunder, feeling heat near fire, or knowing cold upon ice, even the dullest perception should not differ. Sounds, colors, fragrances, and flavors each have their true nature; the distinction between good and evil is self-evident. One cannot take black for white, feathers for horns, bitterness for sweetness, or foulness for fragrance. Yet when preferences diverge so starkly, they become their opposites. Such things cannot be inferred by analogy or guessed at; to invert beauty and ugliness is truly strange.\n\nA lowered gaze upon jade’s veins, a sidelong glance at a clever smile—these please the eyes of the multitude. Yet the Yellow Emperor loved the hideous features of his mother, Mo, and did not exchange them for the beauty of fallen blossoms. The Marquis of Chen delighted in the grotesque appearance of Dunqia and would not trade it for the graceful bearing of Yangwen. Roasted lamb and seared swan, minced turtle and bear’s paw steeped in honey—these tempt the mouths of the crowd. Yet King Wen preferred the shoots of water bamboo to the taste of bear’s liver. *Yangchun* and *Bai Xue*, *Ao Chu* and *Cai Ling*—these melodies please the ears of the multitude. Yet Emperor Shun of Han listened to the cries of mountain crows and found them superior to the sounds of strings and bamboo; Marquis Wen of Wei favored the clatter of hammers and chisels over the harmony of bells and stones. The fragrance of *yujin* and *xuanchang*...",

      "translated_text": "Spring orchids and autumn cypripedium—all are fragrant herbs, pleasing to every nose. Yet the *Hairen* delights in the stench of corpses and scorns the sweetest perfumes. The *Hairen*, dwelling by the sea, revels in the foul reek of decay. Once, a man came to the shore, anointing himself with the stench of death. The *Hairen*, catching the scent, chased after him, declaring the odor still insufficient. Such men are bound by their nature’s bias: clinging to their preferences in defiance of the multitude, they invert white to black, transmute bitterness to sweetness, shift horns to feathers, and mistake stench for incense. Beauty and ugliness have no fixed form; love and hatred no true boundary.\n\n**Chapter Forty: On Military Defense**\nIn the pristine simplicity of high antiquity, the people’s hearts knew no desire. As the age grew thin and the times decadent, strife arose and warfare was born. Shennong strung wood into bows and carved wood into arrows. The power of bow and arrow awed the world. Later, Chiyou grew fierce and violent, delighting in aggression and battle. He smelted metal into blades and sliced leather into armor, and thus warfare flourished. The Yellow Emperor fought at Zhuolu; Zhuanxu contended at Buzhou (a mountain in the Western Sea). Gonggong clashed with Zhuanxu at Buzhou Mountain. Gonggong was routed, ramming his head into the mountain, which collapsed, the pillar of heaven snapped, and the four cords of the earth were severed. Thus the northwest slanted, and the sun now sets in the west. Gonggong stomped the east with his foot, severing the earth’s veins. Hence water flows eastward. The common saying goes: “Heaven tilts in the northwest, earth is sundered in the southeast.”\n\nYao battled at Danshui, Shun campaigned against the Youmiao, Xia punished the Youhu, Yin attacked Gebo, and Zhou struck Chonghou. Warfare is a baleful instrument, a devourer of wealth and a scourge upon the people. The Five Emperors and Three Kings could not eliminate it, for its purpose is to suppress violence and quell disorder—not to squander resources and harm the people. Yet when multitudes gather, wealth scatters; when blades clash, the people suffer. Such is the nature of things.\n\nThus, in warfare, the highest art is to vanquish through strategy rather than to prize the clash of blades. To fight a hundred battles and win a hundred victories is not the acme of skill. The true master of warfare prevails without fighting—this is the pinnacle of excellence. The kingly army cultivates the upright Dao to subdue others; the hegemonic army employs cunning and deception to secure victory.\n\nThe general is the guardian of the state’s safety and the people’s lives—he must not be taken lightly. Thus, he is invested in the ancestral temple and entrusted with the axe of authority. Once he receives his mandate, he dons mourning robes and exits through the ominous gate. From that moment, when he faces the army, he forgets his kin; when he seizes the drumstick, he forgets himself. Only then can he be unbound by heaven above or earth below, fear no enemy before him, and turn his back on none behind. He weighs the nation’s fate as his foremost concern and prizes wisdom and strategy above all.\n\nThus, the general must master the seasons, discern terrain, and refine human strategy. To master the seasons is to scrutinize the movements of the seven luminaries, fathom the tendencies of the five phases, heed the stirrings of the eight winds, and observe the portents of the five clouds. To discern terrain is to recognize the configurations of the seven encampments and array the nine strategic positions. In mountainous battles, do not advance uphill; in marshy engagements, do not ford deep waters; on level ground, avoid treacherous hollows.\n\nTo refine human strategy is to embody the five virtues and grasp the two handles. The five virtues are wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness. The two handles are reward and punishment. Wisdom enables planning; trustworthiness enforces discipline; benevolence fosters love for the people; courage overawes the enemy; strictness commands the multitude. Rewards encourage merit; punishments correct transgressions. Thus, wisdom is the wellspring of adaptability and the repository of ingenuity.\n\nWarfare proceeds by devious means to secure victory. Hence, ten thousand crossbows poised on high—Sun Bin’s stratagem. When Wei dispatched Pang Juan to attack Zhao, Zhao sought aid from Qi. Qi sent Sun Bin to relieve them. Upon arrival, Sun Bin faced Pang Juan in battle. Outnumbered, he feigned retreat to weaken his forces. Pang Juan declared, “I knew the Qi troops were cowards—they retreat without fighting!” He pursued them relentlessly. Sun Bin then set an ambush at the perilous defile of Maling, stationing ten thousand crossbows, all drawn and ready. When the moment came, the arrows flew as one. That day, Pang Juan was utterly routed and slain.\n\nA thousand oxen charging as one—Tian Dan’s ruse. The Qi general was a master of defense. When Yan invaded Qi, seventy cities fell to the Yan forces. Tian Dan held out in Jimo, besieged by Yan but refusing to surrender. The Yan general warned him, “Surrender at once, or I will raze the city and slaughter all within.” Tian Dan replied, “Allow me until tomorrow.” The Yan general granted him the night. Tian Dan then dug tunnels beneath the city, readying a thousand water buffalo. He bound blades and halberds to their horns, painted their bodies with dragon patterns in five colors, and drenched their tails in oil-soaked torches. As the attack neared, he set the torches alight. The buffalo, tails aflame, stampeded through the tunnels into the Yan ranks, sowing chaos. The Yan forces scattered in panic, cut down as they fled. Tian Dan’s troops pursued, striking from behind, and the Yan army was annihilated.\n\nDamming the river with sacks of earth—Han Xin’s gambit. When the Han general led his forces to attack Zhao, Chu came to Zhao’s aid. Han Xin ordered his troops to carry two sacks of earth each, using them to dam the river and cut off the current. He then crossed the water to engage Chu. Feigning defeat, he retreated, luring the Chu forces after him. When half had crossed, Han Xin’s men breached the dam. The Chu troops, trapped midstream, were crushed. The Chu army suffered a crushing defeat.\n\nDragging brush to raise dust—Le Yi’s deception. Le Yi, a general of Jin with few troops, had his soldiers drag brushwood to kick up dust. The enemy, seeing the clouds of dust, assumed a vast army approached and fled in disarray.",

The general loaded pigs onto carts and drove them toward the enemy camp.\n\nCloud ladders wreathed in smoke—Lu Ban’s ingenuity. When Lu attacked the Song city, he had Lu Ban construct cloud ladders.\n\nCunning arises from the unexpected; the few can thwart the many, the weak can break the strong—how much more so when the numerous strike the few, the enlightened attack the benighted.\n\nThe form of warfare resembles water: water flows, avoiding heights to seek low ground; the momentum of war avoids the solid to strike the hollow, shuns strength to attack weakness, evades order to seize chaos, and dodges sharpness to strike decline. Thus, water adapts to terrain to take shape, while troops adapt to the enemy to secure victory—so warfare has no fixed momentum, just as water has no constant form.\n\nObserve the enemy’s form to deploy cunning, follow the shifting tide to respond with change, invert the conventional to achieve ingenuity, and operate without form to attain subtlety. For wind, being tangible, can be blocked by curtains; cold and heat, being formless, cannot be barred by bolts or locks. Therefore, the master of attack leaves the enemy unsure of where to defend, as if dreading thunder and lightning, striking where least expected. The master of defense leaves the enemy unsure of where to attack, as if searching an empty expanse, finding no edge.\n\nGauge my stratagems, and fear not the enemy’s strength; gauge my strength, and fear not the enemy’s schemes. From this, it is clear: one cannot afford to be ignorant.\n\nThe general must take strategy as the foundation and benevolence as the source. Strategy is for controlling the enemy; benevolence is for winning the people. Thus, those who strategize to control the enemy are generals, while those whose strength overcomes the enemy are mere soldiers. Generals must prioritize adaptability, while soldiers must prioritize unified strength.\n\nThe stars fill the sky yet cannot outshine the crescent moon—because their forms differ and their light varies. The tiger, though mighty, is subdued by man—because its heart is not unified and its strength is not aligned. A host of ten thousand with divided hearts is no match for a hundred with a single will; a thousand taking turns in battle are no match for ten striking as one.\n\nTo seek a united host and resolute warriors, benevolence is key—grace and rewards must be clear, and punishments just. Even the lowliest (胥靡: \"mutual\" and \"nothingness\") stand firm in peril without fear, tread on ice without trembling, for they face punishment without fearing for their lives.\n\nNow, soldiers rush into blades without flinching from death, plunge into fire and water as if returning home—not because they scorn life or crave injury, but because benevolence and grace drive them. When a general wins the hearts of his troops, he must share their hardships: in heat, he does not raise a canopy; in cold, he does not don fur—thus equalizing their exposure to the elements. On narrow paths, he does not ride; on hills, he dismounts—thus equalizing their toil. He eats only after the army’s food is cooked, drinks only after the army’s wells are dug—thus sharing their hunger and thirst. In battle, he stands amid arrows and stones—thus sharing their peril.\n\nWhen pure wine is poured into a stream, the entire army downstream becomes drunk. King Goujian of Yue once received a gift of wine in his camp. He said, \"This wine is not enough to share with all.\" So he poured it into the river, and as it flowed downstream, his soldiers drank from it, tasting the wine in the water and becoming sated with intoxication.\n\nA single warm word can warm the entire army like bundled silk. When King Zhuang of Chu led his troops in a snowstorm, his men froze. With kind words, he consoled them, and upon hearing his voice, they felt as if wrapped in warm cotton. If a general wins the hearts of his men, they will vie to rush into death. With such an army, fighting is like rolling stones down a mountain or torrents rushing into a ravine—who can withstand them?\n\n**Section Forty-One: Military Review**\nThe *Methods of Sima* states: The *Methods of Sima Rangju* are the laws of warfare. Though a state be vast, if it delights in war, it will perish; though the world be at peace, if it forgets war, it will be imperiled. Frequent warfare exhausts the people; lack of practice makes them idle. Exhaustion is not a means of preservation, nor is idleness a way to prepare for invaders.\n\nThus, troops should not be deployed recklessly, and martial training should not be neglected—this preserves the people’s lives and maintains military readiness. Confucius said, \"To not train the people in war is to abandon them.\" The *Book of Changes* says, \"The noble person refines weapons to prepare for the unforeseen.\"\n\nTherefore, in spring they *sou*, in summer they *miao*, in autumn they *mi*, and in winter they *shou*—all conducted during agricultural lulls to practice martial affairs. Every three years, they train, and the troops become skilled in warfare. The *sou* marks the beginning of military affairs; the *zhenlv* refers to the return and reorganization of the army. Upon returning, they feast and report to the ancestral temple, displaying their ranks, clarifying hierarchy, ordering seniority, distinguishing ranks, and practicing etiquette.\n\nWhen the three armies are vast and scattered, standards are raised. If voices cannot be heard, drums and bells are used to convey commands; if sights cannot be seen, banners and flags are employed to guide the eyes. If the people are untrained in war, they will not hear the drums or recognize the signals, advancing or retreating without coordination, their formations disordered. Thus, soldiers tremble before battle, horses sweat before the charge—not because the men are cowardly or the horses weak, but because of lack of training.\n\nKing Helü of Wu had palace women trained in battle formations, drilling them in laws and commands, their movements and retreats perfectly aligned with the rules. Though they tread through fire and water without flinching, it was not their nature to be brave or their temperaments to be fierce—it was the result of training.\n\nA blunt blade may seem dull in the hands of the unskilled but sharp in the hands of the adept; yet skill brings victory, while clumsiness leads to defeat—it is all a matter of practice or its absence.\n\nHelü tested his people at the Five Lakes (the waters of Yue, where the Hu and Yue peoples excelled in naval warfare). Swords pressed to shoulders drew unceasing blood. Goujian drilled his troops in their quarters, and they vied to enter fire and water. Over a thousand died before the gong sounded the retreat—not because they hated life or craved death, but because rewards and punishments were clear, and training was thorough.",

When half had crossed, Han Xin’s men breached the dam. The Chu troops, trapped midstream, were crushed. The Chu army suffered a crushing defeat.\n\nDragging brush to raise dust—Le Yi’s deception. Le Yi, a general of Jin with few troops, had his soldiers drag brushwood to kick up dust. The enemy, seeing the clouds of dust, assumed a vast army approached and fled in disarray.",

      "translated_text": "Penglai was skilled in archery, yet could not employ a bow that was not properly tuned. (Penglai studied archery under Yi and mastered all of Yi’s techniques—hence the claim that he was skilled in archery.) Zaofu was skilled in charioteering, yet could not spur a horse that had not been broken. (Zaofu was the seven-times great-grandfather of Viscount Jian of Zhao, a man of King Mu of Zhou’s time who drove the royal chariot up Mount Kunlun.) Ban Chui, the master craftsman of Shennong’s age, was skilled in cutting, yet could not wield an axe that was not sharp. Sun Wu was skilled in command, yet could not fight with troops that had not been trained.\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor taught bears and grisly beasts to battle, or when the Luo clan taught eagles, hawks, and crows to strike, even creatures of brute nature could follow human instruction and engage in combat—all through the power of training. How, then, could the people of a state not be drilled in martial arts?\n\nThus, through constant practice in archery and charioteering, one becomes so proficient in the hunt that capture and seizure come naturally—all the result of training. Without prior practice, one fears only stumbling and fleeing; how can one hope for success? When trained troops clash with untrained ones, it is like the Hu and Yue peoples competing in swimming—there is no contest.\n\nFor this reason, the early kings, taking advantage of periods of leisure, conducted grand reviews to select the multitude, repair and prepare weapons, and make ready the state’s defenses. (Here, *shan* means to prepare for war.) This was the foresight of governance.\n\n**Chapter 42: Adaptive Power**\n\nTo follow principle and maintain constancy is the Dao; to respond to danger and control change is *quan* (adaptive power). The term *quan* is like a steelyard: the beam measures deviation from the upright, while the sliding weight assesses the balance of forces. When weights are unequal, the beam reveals it. If a link is added to the left side, the right tilts; if added to the right, the left tilts. Only when nothing is added does equilibrium prevail.\n\nIn human affairs, one must respond to circumstances and control change, weighing the balance of forces. When equilibrium is achieved, action follows—just as with the steelyard. The *quan* of antiquity carefully assessed weight and balance, acting only when it accorded with principle.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Compliance is the means by which *quan* is exercised.” The *Analects* says: “One may be guided to the Dao, but not to *quan*.” *Quan* reverses the norm yet aligns with the Dao; it contravenes conventional morality yet ultimately achieves good—like the blossoms of the *tangdi* tree, which turn back to face one another.\n\nWhen a filial son serves his parents, he softens his expression and humbles his bearing, fulfilling all duties of devotion and reverence. Yet if his father falls into the water, he seizes him by the hair to rescue him—not out of disrespect, but to save his life. Thus, to pull a drowning father from the water or to curse a ruler in prayer are acts born of necessity, the very purpose of *quan*.\n\nCompassion is the natural sentiment of humanity, yet “great righteousness severs kinship.” To sever kinship may bring greater honor—all for the sake of righteousness. Thus, when compassion and righteousness are weighed, righteousness prevails, and kinship may be set aside.\n\nExamples abound: Shun banished his arrogant brother Xiang; the Duke of Zhou executed his brother Guan Shu; Shi Que killed his son Shi Hou (Shi Que was a grandee of Wei, and his son Shi Hou rebelled, so Shi Que put him to death); and Ji You forced his brother Shu Ya to drink poison (Ji You was the younger brother of Duke Zhuang of Lu by the same mother, while Shu Ya was a half-brother. When Duke Zhuang fell ill, Shu Ya sought to enthrone his full brother, but the duke wished to enthrone Ji You instead. Ji You then hosted a feast at the home of Shu Ya’s elder brother, where he served Shu Ya wine. The elder brother warned, “To drink is to die.” Shu Ya drank and perished. Ji You then installed Shu Ya’s son to succeed his father’s position).\n\nTo weigh kinship against righteousness—these are cases of the same kind.\n\nTo deceive one’s father or countermand a ruler’s command are acts of rebellion for a minister or son. Yet when Shun took without reporting, or when Xian Gao falsified orders (Xian Gao was a merchant of Zheng who, while transporting goods abroad, encountered the Qin army poised to attack Zheng. He met them on the road and said, “The lord of Zheng knows of your army’s approach and has sent me with treasures to present to you.” The Qin forces concluded that Zheng was forewarned and prepared, so they seized his goods and withdrew, sparing Zheng. This was Xian Gao’s stratagem, using *quan* to repel the Qin troops), the gravity of extinguishing a lineage outweighed the transgression of failing to report or countermanding orders—this is the righteousness of *quan*.\n\nWhen the Dao prevails, there is no need for *quan*; when the Dao is lost, *quan* arises. The Dao in use is like clothing and caps upon the body; the weight of *quan* is like armor and helmets defending it. Armor and helmets cannot be worn constantly, nor can *quan* be employed at all times. Only the wise and sagacious can wield it properly.\n\n*Volume Eight of the Liuzi concludes here.*\n\n*Volume Nine of the Liuzi*\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou*",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Forty-Three: Valuing Speed**\n\nThough achievements may be equal, swiftness in opportunity is paramount; though schemes may align, slowness is inferior. Why? Talent excels in success through speed, and wisdom shines in counsel through swiftness. Those who skillfully resolve matters are like rescuers of fire or drowning—those who devise plans are like fleet-footed steeds or swift arrows.\n\nNow, if a house is ablaze, one rushes to douse the flames; if a man is swept away by rapids, one hastens to pull him from the water. *You* is the name of a river. If one were to dig a well to extinguish a fire, the house would already be reduced to ashes; if one were to carve a boat to save a drowning man, he would already be buried in the belly of the river fish.\n\nThe steed is prized because it can cover a thousand *li* in a day—if it takes ten days to arrive, it is no better than a nag. The arrow is valued because it flies straight and true—if it takes a full day to reach its mark, it is no different from one that misses. Wisdom is marvelous because it responds to the moment—if one only knows after the fact, it is no better than ignorance.\n\nIn the past, Wu Qi served as minister to Chu. The noble clans attacked him, for Wu Qi, in governing Chu, enforced strict laws and stripped the noble clans of their ranks and titles, earning their hatred. When the King of Chu died and the crown prince had not yet arrived, the nobles sought to kill Wu Qi. Wu Qi fled into the royal palace and hid behind the king’s corpse. The nobles shot at him but missed. Hearing that the crown prince was near, Wu Qi pulled out the arrows and lodged them in the king’s corpse. Only then did he open the gates to meet the prince, saying, “The nobles have shot at the king’s corpse.” The prince, upon hearing this, executed all the nobles. This was Wu Qi’s swift vengeance—his success lay in speed.\n\nWu Qi wished to punish Yan, so he embedded arrows in the king’s corpse. When Yang Hu was besieged in Lu, the people of Lu released him. Yang Hu was a steward of the Ji clan, and Huanzi was the grandson of the Ji lord. Yang Hu had imprisoned Huanzi, but the people of Lu, believing his clan had caused chaos, sought to execute him. Huanzi escaped and ordered Yang Hu’s imprisonment. The people of Lu guarded the gates to keep Yang Hu in, but he said to them, “If you release me, I will bring you fortune.” They let him go. Once free, Yang Hu dragged a halberd and wounded the man who had released him. When Huanzi demanded to know Yang Hu’s whereabouts, the man replied, “Yang Hu escaped and struck me with his halberd. I could not seize him—this delay is my fault.” Yang Hu wished to repay a debt but wounded his benefactor with a halberd. His scheme repaid kindness with enmity in an instant—his wisdom was truly responsive to the moment.\n\nWhen Zhang Lu entered Qin—Zhang Lu was Fan Sui—he had been slandered in Wei, flogged three hundred times, and left for dead in a latrine. Later, he survived and disguised himself as Xu Jia. Wei Ran regretted not searching for him before departing, and so, when power shifted, he was exiled.\n\nWhen Chao Cuo tunneled through the palace wall, Shentu Jia regretted not executing him before submitting his memorial. The Han king’s inner offices were inconveniently located, so Chao Cuo dug through the palace wall to exit toward the offices. *Shu* was the name of the wall. Shentu Jia, the chancellor, memorialized the throne to execute Chao Cuo, but Chao Cuo, realizing his error, first entered to petition the king. The king, learning that Chao Cuo had tunneled through the wall to reach the offices, did not consider it a transgression. Only afterward did Shentu Jia submit his memorial, arguing that Chao Cuo’s act deserved death. The king replied, “This is merely the palace wall—it is no crime.” Chao Cuo was spared. Shentu Jia, filled with remorse, died of frustration. Thus, acting in anger to the point of death—if wisdom is not decisive early, failure leads only to regret. Such wisdom is no different from ignorance.\n\nTherefore, wisdom that cannot be applied is not true wisdom; ability that cannot respond swiftly is also not true wisdom.

Thus, he spoke of forgoing calligraphy to study the sword.\n\nHan Xin never troubled himself with a single meal.

      "translated_text": "The fault lies in the pettiness of the art. The currents of rivers and lakes may carry rotting carcasses and floating corpses, crisscrossing in tangled streams, yet men drink from them—because their capacity is vast. The water in a basin, if but a mouse’s tail stirs it, is spat out and discarded—because their capacity is small. The *ji* thorn sprouts but a few inches before branching, while the *yuzhang* tree stands a hundred feet tall with sparse limbs. Why is this? Is it not that a small nature yields dense foliage, while a great form bears few nodes?\n\nThus, the heart of the enlightened one embraces the profound and knows no bounds, while the narrow-minded cling to trivialities and fret over minutiae. Viewed from above, the paths of pursuit and abandonment, the breadth or constriction of one’s measure, are plainly discerned.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Five: Adapting to the Times**\nTimes may be pure or turbid, customs refined or barbaric—one cannot govern them with a single Dao, nor unify them with a single form. Thus, non-action transformed the age of the Three Sovereigns; laws and techniques governed the era of the Seven Warring States; virtue and righteousness softened the hearts of the Central Kingdom; and policies and punishments awed the natures of the Four Barbarians. Therefore, the *Yijing* values adapting to the times, and ritual esteems following customs—acting in accord with the moment.\n\nWhen frost-laden winds howl fiercely, Zhou’s farmers do not grasp their sickles; when scorching heat blazes, Cao’s herdsmen do not stitch furs—knowing the time is not right. Those who peddle ceremonial caps do not venture into Min or Yue (two southern kingdoms), nor do those who hawk straw sandals enter *Guangxia* (a region where people go bareheaded and barefoot)—knowing the customs are unsuited.\n\nThus, to save the starving, a pearl the size of a thumbnail is not as good as acorns and beans (acorns being the fruit of the oak, beans being soybeans); to rescue the drowning, a jade slab a foot square is not as good as a short rope. It is not that acorns and ropes are precious while pearls and jade are base, but that beauty is useless where urgency lies. In the face of hunger and drowning, can pearls and jade save lives?\n\nWhen a boat founders midstream, a single gourd is worth a thousand gold—value is not constant, for the times dictate it. Once, when Qin attacked Liang, King Hui of Liang said to Meng Ke: “Sir, you have not disdained the thousand *li* to grace our humble state. Now Qin attacks Liang—how shall we repel them?” Meng Ke replied: “In ancient times, when the Di tribes attacked Tai Wang at Bin, he offered them jade and silk, but they refused. Unwilling to harm his people, Tai Wang abandoned Bin and settled at Qi. Why not leave Liang now?” The king was displeased. What Liang treasured was its state—how could he abandon it? Such counsel was not what he needed, no different from offering pearls to the starving or jade to the drowning.\n\nWhen Duke Xiao of Qin asked Shang Yang about governing Qin, Shang Yang advocated harsh laws and severe punishments. After three years, the people prospered, the army grew strong, and the state flourished, its might subduing the feudal lords. Meng Ke’s discourse on benevolence and righteousness—citing Tai Wang’s abandonment of Bin—proved unfit for the age, while Shang Yang’s shallow and draconian methods succeeded. It is not that benevolence and righteousness are impracticable or that harshness is admirable, but that in an era of shifting alliances, governance must differ. In the age of vertical and horizontal pacts, benevolence and righteousness could not be fully realized.\n\nThus, a bright mirror serves to reflect one’s face, but the blind use it to cover their cups; jade hairpins adorn the head, but the bald crone hangs them on her loom. It is not that the mirror or jade are flawed, but that they are useless to them.\n\nPao Ding carved oxen, suiting the common need (Pao Ding was a butcher in the time of Duke Wen of Jin); Zhu Han slaughtered dragons, his skill of no use (Zhu Han spent a thousand gold to learn dragon-slaying from Tai Long, yet his art found no application in the world). If one strays from the affairs of the age, even the most wondrous arts become useless.\n\nThus, when Laozi journeyed to the Western Rong, he imitated their crude speech; when Yu the Great entered the *Duo* state, he loosened his robes and bared his shoulders—not out of disdain for ritual, but to follow local custom. Mozi, who practiced frugality and opposed music (deeming it wasteful, as men neglect farming and women abandon weaving for its sake), once visited the King of Jing wearing brocade and playing the sheng—adapting to the king’s preferences. It was not that he betrayed his nature, but that he followed the tastes of the time.",

The Lord of Dai cultivated Mohist ways and met destruction—Mohist, that is, Confucian. The lord of the state of Dai delighted in practicing benevolence and righteousness, offering his kingdom in abdication. The recipient accepted, and the lord of Dai was exiled among the people, where he lived out his days in old age. Duke Yan of Xu practiced benevolence and perished; fond of benevolence and righteousness, he was destroyed by the King of Chu. Yan Qiang embraced righteousness and was annihilated; devoted to benevolence and righteousness, he was slain by his brother-in-law, Viscount Xiang of Zhao, at Huiji. Such ruin, destruction, and annihilation are the consequences of violent disorder, yet these rulers encountered them through the practice of benevolence, righteousness, Confucianism, and Mohism—not because benevolence, righteousness, Confucianism, or Mohism are ineffective, but because their practice was unsuited to the times.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Six: Customs and Mores**\n*Feng* is qi; *su* is habit. The land, water, and springs give rise to qi of varying intensity, and sounds of differing pitch—this is called *feng*. People dwelling in such a place grow accustomed to it and form their nature—this is called *su*. *Feng* may be thick or thin; *su* may be pure or shallow. The transforming influence of a sagely king should refine customs to make them refined, and reform habits to make them upright. Thus, the transformation of superiors over inferiors becomes *feng*; the practices people adopt and follow become *su*.\n\nThe *feng* of Chu and Yue favors courage; their *su* rushes to death without hesitation.

      "translated_text": "Prince Dan of Yan gathered retainers and brave warriors in his rear palace, treating Jing Ke as a guest of honor and lodging him among his concubines, where his consorts and concubines attended to him. Later, the people of Yan imitated this, sending their wives and concubines to serve any guest as a mark of profound respect—though this was contrary to propriety. Their custom thus became to offer wives and concubines to guests. All these were transformations of local *feng* into enduring *su*, shaped by what the people observed and practiced.\n\nTo the east of Yue lay the state of Womu, where, upon a father’s death, the son would carry his mother away and abandon her, declaring her a ghost unfit to share a dwelling. When the eldest son was born, they would carve up meat to feed him, and the mother would call this \"fitting for a younger brother.\" To the south of Chu lay a land of man-eaters, where, when a relative died, they would strip the flesh and bury the bones, calling this filial piety. To the west of Qin lay the state of Yiqu, where, upon a person’s death, they would gather firewood and burn the body until the smoke rose to the heavens, calling this \"ascending in mist.\" To the north of the Hu lay the state of Shegu, where, when a relative died, they would cast the corpse into the river, calling this \"becoming a water immortal.\" All these were the peculiar customs of the Four Barbarians.\n\nThe Former Kings, grieved by the corruption of *feng* and *su*, established rites and teachings to curb their excesses, fashioning ritual and music to harmonize human nature. Thus, when *feng* was transformed and *su* reformed, the world was set right.\n\n**Section Forty-Seven: Advantage and Harm**\nAdvantage and harm are the roots of gain and loss; gain and loss are the sources of success and failure. Thus, to pursue advantage and avoid harm, to cherish gain and detest loss, is the natural inclination of all things. All know to seek advantage and shun harm, yet none recognize how harm may reveal advantage; all understand the desire for gain and aversion to loss, yet none perceive how loss may lead to gain. One who grasps that advantage may become harm, harm may become advantage, gain may turn to loss, and loss may turn to gain—such a person may be spoken to of advantage and harm, gain and loss.\n\nThose with internal heat drink poison not because it is harmless, nor do those with abscesses endure the lancet’s pain without reason. They do so because a small pain dispels a greater one, a minor harm removes a grave danger. Yet to eat twice one’s fill when hungry, to drink excessively when thirsty, to plunge into water when hot, or to leap into fire when cold—though these may briefly soothe the senses, they inevitably bring later calamity. The fragrant herb *jupu* repels fleas and lice but attracts centipedes; *fanshi* halts the pain of tooth decay yet rots the roots. Though the immediate pain may cease, greater harm follows. This is to grasp at small advantages while forgetting greater ones, to shun minor harms while incurring grave ones.\n\nOne with a festering sore on the chest dares not lance it; one stung by a scorpion’s tail dares not cut it away—not out of love for the affliction or the venom, but because lancing or cutting would worsen the sting. A goblet brims with poisoned wine, yet the thirsty man does not drink—not because he is not thirsty, but because drinking would bring instant death. Molten gold glows in the furnace, yet the thief does not scoop it—not because he does not desire it, but because seizing it would burn his flesh. A three-eyed tiger crouches before him, or a *Sui* pearl lies on the ground: though a thief as greedy as Robber Zhi might leap to snatch it, his hands would not dare reach. A dagger points at his heart, or Xi Shi walks by: though a man as lewd as Jing Yang might gaze, his eyes would not linger—not because he does not love treasure or delight in beauty, but because the harm is urgent while the advantage is distant.\n\nOnce in Qi, a merchant displayed fine silk in the marketplace. A thief snatched it from the crowd, and when the officials seized him and asked, \"Why did you steal the silk in plain sight?\" he replied, \"I saw only the silk, not the people.\" Such a man is dazzled by advantage and forgets harm. A fledgling, greedy for bait, forgets danger and is caught in the net. When Confucius saw a fowler, he asked why the man caught only small yellow-beaked birds but not larger ones. The fowler replied, \"The small birds are greedy for bait and easily caught; the larger ones are cunning and refuse to take it, so they are hard to trap.\" The magpie, seeing advantage, forgets itself—yet it rested in Zhuang Zhou’s garden. Zhuang Zhou entered his garden at Diaoling, where a magpie with a seven-foot tail perched, a strange sight indeed. Zhou raised his sling to shoot it, but his heart trembled in fear: \"This is the king’s chestnut grove. If I shoot the magpie now, the king might hear of it and accuse me of stealing his chestnuts.\" So he lowered his sling and withdrew.\n\nThus, the wise see advantage and think of peril; fools see advantage and forget danger. Those who think of peril may avoid it, while those who forget danger invite it. From this, the principles of advantage and harm, of approach and retreat, become clear.\n\n**Section Forty-Eight: Fortune and Misfortune**\nFortune and misfortune share the same root; omens and portents dwell in the same realm. Where misfortune leans, it may turn to fortune; where fortune lies hidden, it may become misfortune. Where omens appear, they may bring good; where portents descend, they may turn to ill. One who understands how misfortune becomes fortune, fortune becomes misfortune, omens become good, and portents become ill—such a person may be spoken to of the nature of things.\n\nKing Helü of Wu won a great victory and deemed it fortune, yet it led to the hardship of Gusu. When Helü battled King Goujian of Yue at the foot of Mount Kuaiji, he triumphed and returned home, where he began constructing the Terrace of Gusu. For seven years, the terrace remained unfinished, and later, when Goujian saw the people suffering by the Five Lakes, he raised an army and destroyed Wu. What began as fortune became a great misfortune.\n\nKing Goujian of Yue took refuge at Kuaiji and deemed it misfortune, yet it led to his hegemony over the Five Lakes. When the king of Yue raised his army to attack Wu, he was utterly defeated. The Rong king, relying on his strength, deemed it fortune, yet it led to his capture beneath the wine vessel. The Rong king, trusting in his might, overthrew King You, but later, You’s grandson captured and killed him beneath a wine vessel.",

      "translated_text": "Chen Pian’s exile was deemed misfortune, yet it ultimately brought the fortune of generous favor. When the Duke of Chen’s son fled to Qi, the Marquis of Qi received him with great courtesy, bestowed upon him rich gifts, and even betrothed his daughter to him—this was fortune indeed. Thus do misfortune and fortune revolve, defying easy prediction.\n\nOnce, a man of Song had a white calf born to his black ox, which he took as an auspicious omen, yet it brought the misfortune of blindness. Though stricken with blindness, this misfortune later became the fortune of survival. A family in Song had a black ox that bore a white calf, and they went to consult Confucius. Confucius said, “This is an auspicious sign.” Later, they slaughtered the calf for sacrifice, and the ox’s owner’s son lost his right eye. Another white calf was born, and they again consulted Confucius. Confucius said, “It is auspicious.” They slaughtered it once more, and the ox’s owner’s elder brother lost his left eye. When Chu later attacked Song, the people of Song were all conscripted as soldiers and perished in battle—only the blind father and son survived.\n\nA northern elder possessed a fine Hu horse, which brought advantage, yet it ultimately led to the misfortune of a fall. Though he suffered this misfortune, it became the fortune of preserving his life. A man from the northern frontier had a stallion that fled into Hu territory. After three years, it returned leading a herd of Hu horses. The man’s son, fond of riding, was thrown by the horse and broke his leg. When the Hu later invaded the northern frontier, all the men were pressed into military service. In battle, none survived, and all were slain by the Hu—only this man, his aged father, and his lame son escaped, spared by the Hu soldiers. Thus misfortune may give rise to fortune.\n\nIf one perceives inauspicious signs and cultivates goodness, then omens reverse and become auspicious. If one sees auspicious signs yet fails to do good, then auspiciousness reverts to ominousness. In the time of King Wu Ding of Yin, mulberry and catalpa trees grew entwined in the court—a portent, for both are ill-omened trees. When trees cluster in the court, it is a monstrous sign. The historian divined, “Wild plants growing in the court—does this not foretell the court’s demise?” Wu Ding was filled with dread and reformed himself through virtue. The mulberry and catalpa withered of their own accord, and within the eight directions, distant peoples came bearing tribute, reviving the Yin dynasty.\n\nIn the time of King Di Xin, a sparrow hatched a kite—a bird of prey—at the corner of the city. The *Book of Songs* says, “The kite soars to heaven,” referring to birds of prey like the osprey. The *Main Chapters* states, “The peng and hong are birds that devour evil.” The historian divined, “A small creature giving birth to a great one—this portends the kingdom’s rise to supremacy.” Yet Di Xin grew arrogant and cruel, and the Yin dynasty perished.\n\nThus do monstrous omens serve as warnings to rulers, just as strange dreams warn the common people. If good governance prevails over monstrous omens, then calamity reverses into fortune. If virtuous words prevail over strange dreams, then fortune turns from misfortune. When misfortune befalls a man, he must fear; in fear, he becomes reverent; in reverence, fortune comes; in fortune, joy arises; in joy, arrogance follows; in arrogance, misfortune returns. Therefore, the noble man, upon receiving auspicious signs, does not rejoice excessively but remains reverent and frugal, cultivating sincerity. When omens appear, he does not grieve excessively but focuses on cultivating virtue. Thus does he summon blessings from the spirits, dispel disaster, and invite fortune.\n\nGreed for small gains is the undoing of great profit; petty stinginess is the ford to great calamity. If one covets small gains, great profit will surely be lost; if one clings to petty stinginess, great calamity will surely arrive. The Lord of Shu was by nature greedy. When King Hui of Qin heard of this and wished to conquer him, the mountain ravines were too treacherous for an army to pass. So he carved stones into the shape of oxen, laden with gold, placing them behind the oxen each day, calling it “ox dung” and claiming it as a gift for the Lord of Shu. The Lord of Shu, covetous, ordered the mountains leveled and valleys filled, sending five mighty laborers to retrieve the stone oxen. The Qin army followed in their wake, annihilating the state and destroying the lord, becoming a laughingstock for all under heaven—for coveting small gains, he lost his great profit.\n\nBai Gong Sheng of Chu was by nature greedy and stingy. He was the lord of Bai County in Chu. Bai Gong, whose name was Sheng, rebelled and raised an army to seize the state of Jing, killing the Chu minister Zi Xi. After killing Zi Xi and seizing Jing, he amassed wealth and treasures, filling his storehouses, refusing to share with the people. Shi admonished him, “Now that disaster has come, the state is in peril and unstable. The pivot of victory or defeat, survival or ruin, is already clear in your heart. If you cannot distribute wealth to win the people’s hearts, you might as well burn it, lest the people turn against you and harm you.” But he would not listen. When the Earl of Ye entered the city, Sheng opened the great treasury to distribute wealth to the people and emptied the storehouses to bestow treasures upon them. They rose up and attacked him, and after nineteen days, Bai Gong perished. Wealth does not belong to oneself, yet he desired to possess it—through this petty stinginess, great calamity arose.\n\nIn the cold northern lands, there is a beast called the *bao*, found in the mountains of the five regions. It has the body of a sheep, the face of a man, eyes beneath its armpits, and horns growing from its chest. Its cry is like that of an infant, and it is fiercely greedy, known as the *taotie*. The beast loves to sharpen its horns, making them keen for use, yet this only enrages its heart, causing its *qi* to congeal within until it dies. Its horns grow from its chest, and as it bends to grind them, its heart becomes enraged, and it dies.\n\nIn the southern lands, there is a bird called the *xiao*, a yin bird that dwells in caves to raise its young. When the chicks grow, they devour their mother before taking flight. This is the modern *chixiao*. The *Book of Songs* says, “O *chixiao*, O *chixiao*, you depart singing and return wailing,” foretelling first fortune, then misfortune—this refers to the *tuniao*. The mother broods over her chicks for a hundred days until they mature. Once their wings are fully grown, they eat their mother and fly away.\n\nThe Lord of Shu’s welcoming of the Qin oxen brought them ever closer, yet his own peril grew—how is this different from the beast grinding its horns, sharpening them until its own demise? Bai Gong’s hoarding of wealth only deepened his ruin—how is this different from the *xiao* raising its young, only for them to grow and destroy it? Thus the wise man perceives the mechanisms of fortune and misfortune, discerns the origins of success and failure, and does not harm himself through reckless gain or endanger himself through excessive stinginess.",

If their kind gathers, though distant they do not part; if their group divides, though near they never unite. Thus when the copper mountain in Shu collapsed, bells rang in response at Ya; in the Jin era, when the copper mountain in Shu crumbled, all bronze vessels—bells and chimes—throughout the land resonated in unison. Though the Zi and Mian rivers share a single stream, their colors and flavors differ in essence; yet resonance by kind is the inevitable pattern of nature. During the Jin dynasty, Zhang Hua distinguished flavors; when the Prince of Jin blended the waters of the Zi and Mian to make a broth and offered it to Zhang Hua, he tasted it and immediately said: \"This broth bears the flavors of both the Zi and Mian rivers.\"\n\nThus creatures that take flight belong to the group of yang, while those that burrow and crouch belong to the kind of yin. Hence at the summer solstice, deer shed their antlers—on the summer solstice, deer lose their antlers, while on the winter solstice, elk shed theirs. When the moon wanes, clams and oysters diminish—clams and oysters grow when the moon darkens, and when the moon is new, pearls transform into oysters, an ancient constant. As recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: \"When the sun and moon wane, clams and oysters diminish.\" *Diminish* here means *to grow*. When the qilin perishes, the sun is eclipsed; when the whale dies, comets appear. When the east wind arrives, wine overflows its vessels; when silkworms spin their threads, merchants’ silk supplies are cut off; when the new grain is harvested, the old grain is depleted. When a dragon rises from a single well, clouds spread across the nine heavens—long ago, Boyi dug a well, and as he struck water, a dragon summoned rain that ascended to the nine heavens, while dark clouds descended in majesty to blanket the earth.

      "translated_text": "**Liuzi, Scroll Ten**\n\n*Annotated by Yuan Xiaozheng, Recorder of Bozhou*\n\n**On Proper Judgment (Fifty-First)**\n\nJudgment serves to discern truth; critique serves to uphold principle. If judgment is not just, truth becomes entangled with falsehood; if critique is not balanced, principle strays from reality. The loss of principle stems from revering the ancient and scorning the present; the confusion of truth arises from trusting hearsay and dismissing what the eye beholds. Though past and present differ, their proximity to the imperial era is the same; though ears and eyes perceive differently, their capacity for discernment is equal. If discernment is equal yet judgment varies, it cannot be called just; if proximity is the same yet critique diverges, it cannot be called fair. When critique is just yet all is overturned, both truth and principle fall into chaos.\n\nConsider how men of today find it easy to skillfully depict ghosts and demons, yet struggle to render dogs and horses with precision. Why? Ghosts and demons are formless, while dogs and horses are manifest. The formless may be adorned with grotesqueries to display marvelous shapes, but the manifest cannot be falsified without exposing their true nature—thus, their reality reveals their wonder. To conjure strangeness from the formless is to pass off falsehood as truth; to model after true forms is to doubt truth as falsehood.\n\nIn ancient times, Duke Ai of Lu longed for the worthies Ji and Xie, yet failed to recognize the sagacity of Confucius; Duke Jing of Qi extolled the strategies of Guan Zhong, yet remained oblivious to the wisdom of Yan Ying. Zhang Bosong—of the Han dynasty—admired the erudition of Dong Zhongshu, yet overlooked the brilliance of Yang Ziyun. Confucius’ sagacity was no less radiant than Ji and Xie’s; Yan Ying’s worth was no lesser than Guan Zhong’s; Yang Ziyun’s talent was no inferior to Dong Zhongshu’s. Yet they were not esteemed—was this not because men prize the distant and scorn the near, treasure hearsay and despise sight, valuing empty renown while disparaging true substance?\n\nSuch worldly judgments are not made arbitrarily to exalt one and belittle another, to embellish names while undermining reality. Rather, they arise from the mingling of good and evil, the difficulty of distinguishing truth from falsehood. Men measure things by sentiment, trusting their hearts to determine right and wrong. Yet when the heart weighs the weight of a hair’s tip, none can discern it; but suspend it from a balance, and the slightest weight becomes clear. Thus, the sage knew that right and wrong are hard to clarify, light and heavy hard to determine, and so established standards to measure the nature of things. A balance, once hung, cannot be deceived in weight; a marking line, once laid, cannot be falsified in straightness; compass and square, once set, cannot be misled in shape. Therefore, to measure things by standards is to easily distinguish truth from falsehood; to trust the heart in judging principle is to obscure right and wrong.\n\nA man of Yue served a guest of Qin a dish of snake, which the guest savored, mistaking it for carp. Only upon learning it was snake did he clutch his throat and retch—this was a failure to know true flavor. A man of Zhao passed off a vulgar tune as the music of Bo Ya, and the world rushed to learn it. When they later discovered the deception, they bound their fingers and ceased—this was a failure to know true sound. A man of Song took a stone from Yan for fine jade, encasing it in a bronze casket. When he learned it was mere stone, he cast aside the casket—this was a failure to recognize true jade. A man of Ying composed a fu and attributed it to Qu Yuan, and the world recited it. When they learned it was not his, they sealed their lips and discarded it—this was a failure to know true literature. Thus, only Yi Ya did not mistake snake for carp in flavor; only Zhong Ziqi did not err in recognizing the vulgar tune’s discordance; only Qi Dun—of Qin, skilled in jade—did not confuse the stone of Yan for true jade; only Sima Xiangru did not overpraise the Ying fu’s ornate verses.\n\nOnce, two men appraised a piece of jade. One called it fine; the other, ugly. After long debate, neither could convince the other. Each said: “If you place it before my eyes, fine and ugly will be clear.” The jade’s form was fixed, yet their judgments differed—not out of mere contradiction, but because their eyes saw differently. A hall’s pearls and curtains, adorned with golden splendor, shimmer with radiant hues, dazzling the eye. Yet a drunken man, his gaze unsteady, calls them flames—though the hall’s adornments remain unchanged, his eyes have altered. A mirror shaped like a cup reflects Xi Shi: when held vertically, her face appears long; when held horizontally, it appears broad. Not that Xi Shi’s beauty changed, but the reflection did. Those who dwell by the sea see islands as boats and boats as gulls, yet those who seek boats do not sail to islands, nor do archers aim at gulls when they mean to shoot boats—knowing that distant sight confuses the eye and misleads the heart. Those who walk at the foot of a mountain see ridge-top trees as hairpins and ravine tigers as dogs, yet those who seek hairpins do not climb the trees, nor do they call out to dogs—knowing that height distorts vision and bewilders the heart. Yet when men observe others or critique literature, they mistake greatness for pettiness, ability for baseness, unaware that their eyes are deceived and their hearts confused—is this not the opposite of gazing upon mountains and seas?\n\nOnce, Confucius ate millet before other foods. His attendants stifled their laughter. Confucius said: “Millet is the chief of the five grains, so I eat it first.” Ziyou wore a coarse robe and spoke broadly, and Zeng Shen wagged his fingers in mockery. The conduct of sages and worthies was not in error, yet they could not escape ridicule—how much harder, then, for men of no renown to avoid scorn in their bearing and literary grace? From this, we see that right may be called wrong, beauty may be deemed ugliness, and names and realities may be inverted—truly, a cause for lament.\n\nNow, those who expound principle entrust it to the discerning. The noble man, wise and enlightened, surpasses what he has heard before; his clear mirror reveals what lies beyond expectation. He is not dazzled by names and realities, nor swayed by the bias of past and present. He grasps the essence of intent, disregards extraneous embellishment, neither obscures the smallest good nor eclipses the faintest light.

      "translated_text": "The term *mie* means \"to belittle.\" Master Father, named Yan, was a man of Chu. Fond of learning yet poor in family, he was bullied by his relatives and friends. Later, in the Han dynasty, he rose to become a minister and was granted the feast of five tripods, dining to the sound of bells, with a fief of three hundred households.\n\nHad Zhang Yi not endured the humiliation at the hall’s steps, he would never have harbored the ambition to enter Qin. Had Fan Sui not suffered the disgrace in the privy, he would not have nurtured the resolve to return to Wei. Yu Yue, spurred by hardship, refined his scholarship and ultimately became the teacher of King Wei of Zhou. Ban Chao, roused by indignation, practiced martial arts and eventually achieved merit in the Western Regions. Xiao Yue, impoverished in his youth, worked as a hired laborer. At thirty, he devoted himself to study, resting neither day nor night for fifteen years. Through his learning, he attained eminence, and King Wei of Qi appointed him as his teacher.\n\nObserving these worthies, we see that all were stirred to ambition by adversity and rose to fame through struggle. Thus, the five-crossroads highway on the plain is easy to traverse, while the solitary peak’s nine-fold path is a treacherous climb. Descending from heights is within even a mediocre horse’s stride, but scaling sheer cliffs demands the agility of a flying squirrel. It is by overcoming peril that one gains esteem, and by surmounting difficulty that one proves worthy.\n\nThe heroes of old thrived in hardship and expanded in constraint. Each possessed talent and wisdom, and when their time came, they were employed by the world.\n\n**Cherishing Time, Fifty-Three**\nWhen a lamp is placed upon a stand, the flame that burns now is not the flame that burned before, yet the wise cannot perceive this. When a mountain is concealed in a marsh, its present form is not its past form, yet the discerning cannot know it. Why? The fire is extinguished moment by moment, and the mountain shifts imperceptibly.\n\nHeaven’s revolution is called \"turning,\" its passing swift as an arrow—even the fleetest divine steed cannot overtake it. Man’s brief life is like a spark struck from stone, flashing by in an instant. Only the establishment of virtue and the bequeathal of love endure beyond death.\n\nThe noble men of old, wishing to practice benevolence and righteousness throughout the world, raced against time, prizing not a foot of jade but every inch of fleeting light. Thus, Great Yu, hastening to seize the moment, left his cap hanging without a glance. Nan Rong, seeking the Dao, wore out his sandals without rest. The disciples of Laozi, ashamed to question their master, pressed on. Confucius, ever urgent, had no time to blacken his stove; Mo Di, ever restless, could not warm his mat. All practiced their virtue, rescued the world from drowning, established merit, and left models for a hundred generations.\n\nYet men today advance without knowing retreat. Dazzled by decaying splendor, they carve away their desires, adorn themselves with fine strings and songs, and curry favor with scenic springs and rocks. In retreat, they cannot wield the brush to record deeds or aid an enlightened age. They consume millet like locusts, wasting their years. In life, they become men of no renown; in death, they are but a coffin’s dust—how do they differ from plants that live and die unnoticed?\n\nWhen autumn arrives, the freezing wind howls through the branches, and the clear dew transforms the leaves. Then the cold cicada clings to the tree, crying out in bitter lament. Why? As its time nears and its life is pressed by the harsh frost, it laments even the withered willow. Now, as I face the western peak, my Daoist practice remains unfulfilled. My voice is stifled in the shadow of barren cliffs, unheard in this flourishing age. How can I avoid being stained by the soot of future generations or tainted by the ink of pine smoke?\n\n**Garden of Words, Fifty-Four**\nLoyalty and filial piety are the treasures of all conduct. Without cultivating loyalty and filial piety, even if one possesses other virtues, it is like a storehouse filled with jade fragments—unfit to be carved into ritual scepters—or a basket brimming with silk threads—unusable for weaving fine sashes. However much there is, of what use is it?\n\nTrust and yielding are the harmony of all conduct; deceit and boasting are its perversion. When trust and yielding deviate from ritual, they become perverse; when deceit and boasting align with righteousness, they become harmonious.\n\nZhi Gong testified against his father: though his father stole a sheep and his son exposed him, his conduct was upright yet contrary to ritual. Cangwu yielded to his elder brother: though he gave his beautiful wife to his brother and took her as his sister-in-law, his yielding was not in accord with ritual. Thus, even trust and yielding can become perverse.\n\nXian Gao falsified a royal command: though he deceived as a merchant, his act was still deemed harmonious. Great Yu spoke boldly: his boasting was in accord with righteousness. He denounced Jie and Zhou with fiery anger and compared kings to Boyi and Shuqi with joyful approval. Where benevolence and righteousness reside, even a common man is weighty; where they depart, even the exalted are light.\n\nMatters can be assured through sincerity, and principles can be understood through empathy. By the brightness of the autumn moon, one knows the longing of a widow; by the rustling of the forest wind, one perceives the alarm of a boatman.\n\nYang qi governs life, which all things delight in; yin qi governs death, which all things regret. Thus, spring blossoms bask in the sun as if smiling, while autumn leaves weep with dew. The good at friendship do not alter their intentions with parting or reunion, nor shift their feelings with life or death. They remain the same at the end as at the beginning, like the sun and moon—both bright at rising and setting, both whole in waxing and waning.\n\nHeaven is impartial toward life and death; one cannot resent it for its nature. Thus, in the warmth of spring, the flourishing do not give thanks, and in the chill of autumn, the withering do not lament. Flourishing and withering follow fate; hardship and fortune have their appointed times.\n\nThough spring herbs thrive, they rely on morning dew to unfurl their verdure; though autumn leaves are fragile, they fall at the touch of a gentle breeze. All things are supple in warmth and harden in cold. Thus, spring horns can be coiled, summer branches can be knotted, autumn dew can congeal, and winter ice can be shattered.\n\nMen all love youth and despise old age, cherish glory and disdain decay. They adorn themselves with blossoming splendor yet burn the ashes of withered remains, unaware that withered remains arise from blossoming splendor, and blossoming splendor returns to withered remains.\n\nMountains harboring jade are quarried; rivers holding pearls are drained. Leopards bearing patterns are flayed; men possessing wisdom are envied.",

      "translated_text": "Wisdom can know others but cannot know itself; spirit can protect things but cannot protect itself. Thus, the divine tortoise is scorched for its wisdom, the sacred serpent is exposed for its spirit—who knows that unwisdom is wisdom, and spiritlessness is spirit?\n\nThe wondrous must rely on things, yet things do not generate the wondrous; skill must depend on tools, yet tools do not perfect skill. Thus, Yi could not hit the smallest target without bow and arrow, yet what hit the target was not the bow and arrow. The hammer cannot split well without axe and adze, yet what splits well is not the axe and adze.\n\nPainting imitates form, so substance precedes ornament; speech conveys feeling, so truth precedes eloquence. Without substance, ornament is not form; without truth, eloquence is not feeling. Rouge and kohl adorn the face to enhance beauty, yet few turn their gaze; intricate melodies on the strings strive for sorrow, yet few are moved—this is because the substance is not beautiful. Where substance is not beautiful, even lavish adornment lacks splendor; where melody is not harmonious, even swift rhythms lack pathos.\n\nPrinciple stirs the heart and appears in the countenance; emotion arises within and takes shape in sound. Thus, forced fear may smile but knows no joy; forced weeping may seem mournful but feels no sorrow. To hear what one loathes is worse than not hearing; to see what one loathes is worse than not seeing. Therefore, one covers one’s ears at thunder and shields one’s eyes from lightning.\n\nTo practice benevolence is not profitable; to pursue profit is not benevolent. Thus, grain merchants desire famine, and apothecaries desire illness. Each values what it serves, and Jie and Zhou’s dogs may bark at Yao. Thus, thieves and brigands may scorn Confucius as base, though they surpass other thieves and brigands.\n\nWhen fortune declines, one blames Heaven; when humiliation comes, one resents others. Thus, one blames the inventor of fire when burned, or curses Boyi when drowning in a well. Without planting kindness in advance, one bestows favors in crisis; without guarding against beginnings, one cultivates caution after harm is done—like digging a well when thirsty or planting a tree when hungry, though swift, it comes too late.\n\nGongyi loved fish (Gongyi was a Chu man who craved fish); Qu Dao loved water caltrop (though not the finest flavor, all found it sweet, for it was shared by all). King Wen savored gall, Zeng Shen relished dates—bitter and sour, yet the two found them sweet, for they differed from the crowd.\n\nThe deer resembles the horse yet outruns it; the dhole resembles the dog yet surpasses it in strength. A state may have a thousand-gold horse but no thousand-gold deer; a household may have a thousand-gold dog but no thousand-gold dhole—because dogs and horses are useful, while dholes and deer are not.\n\n**The Nine Schools (Fifty-Five):**\n\n**Daoists**—such as Lao Dan, Guan Yin, Pang Juan, and Zhuang Zhou—take emptiness as their root, purity as their heart, humility as their virtue, and weakness as their conduct. They dwell in non-action, teach without words, shape the cosmos without appearing near, and nurture the ten thousand things without claiming merit. Yet their shallow followers wholly abandon loyalty and filial piety, sever benevolence and righteousness, and rely solely on emptiness, seeking governance thereby.\n\n**Confucians**—such as Yan Ying, Zisi, Meng Ke, and Xun Qing—follow the nature of yin and yang, clarify the roots of education, roam the Six Arts, and cherish the Five Constants. They favor elaborate burials and ornate robes, value music and accept fate, trace their lineage to Yao and Shun, model themselves on Wen and Wu, and revere Confucius as their master to exalt his Way. Yet their shallow followers expand texts endlessly, making them difficult to exhaust.\n\n**Yin-Yang School**—such as Zi Wei, Zou Yan, Sang Qiu, and Nan Gong—revere and follow august Heaven, chart the sun, moon, and stars, respectfully grant the people their seasons, model the three luminaries’ measures, follow the four seasons’ movements, know the five phases’ natures, and comprehend the eight winds’ qi to enrich the people and order governance. Yet their shallow followers are bound by taboos and drowned in divination.\n\n**Logicians**—such as Song Keng (a Qin scholar, as recorded in the *Spring and Autumn Annals*), Yin Wen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long—rectify names, for if names are not rectified, speech is not smooth. Thus, they define hierarchy, correct names and duties, value equality and frugality, and forbid attack and cease warfare. They crafted the Huashan cap to symbolize balanced governance, and their lenient doctrines demonstrate distinctions.

Yet their shallow followers pare away benevolence and discard righteousness, relying solely on penal law, making customs harsh and lacking in kindness.\n\n**Mohists**—such as Yin Yi, Mo Di, Qin Gua, and Hu Pai—practice frugality, humility, and esteem for the worthy; honor ghosts, reject fate, advocate simple burials and plain garments, and oppose unjust warfare. Yet their shallow followers’ Way is too austere, their frugality too hard to follow.\n\n**Diplomats**—such as Quezi (named Ziwo, a Qi man skilled in warfare), Pang Nuan, Su Qin, and Zhang Yi—base their art on practicing benevolence, interpreting two states’ sentiments, alleviating the scourge of war, accepting commands but not words, adapting to circumstances to seize opportunities, rescuing danger and righting imbalance, turning misfortune into fortune. Yet their shallow followers merely indulge in cunning rhetoric and abandon loyalty and trust.\n\n**Eclectics**—such as Kong Jia, Wei Liao, Shi Qiao, and Huai Yi—illuminate yin and yang, root themselves in the Dao and virtue, blend Confucianism and Mohism, merge Logicians and Legalists, embrace Diplomacy, and incorporate Agriculture.

      "translated_text": "**Agriculturalists**—such as Shen Nong, Ye Lao, Zai Shi, and Fan Shengzhi—base their way on farming, expanding cultivation, sowing and planting the hundred grains. When the state’s granaries are full and households have surplus stores, ritual and propriety naturally arise. Yet their shallow followers would have kings and commoners plow side by side in the fields, erasing distinctions of rank and disrupting the order between ruler and subject.\n\nSurveying the teachings of these nine schools, though they vary in depth and their words in detail, diverging in form and branching into separate paths, they all share the same profound principle and converge in the Dao of governance. Though their traces differ, their ultimate aim is the same—just as the five phases overcome one another yet also engender one another, the four seasons oppose yet together complete the year, the waters of the Zi and Mian rivers rise from different sources but flow into the same sea, the notes gong and shang differ in sound yet harmonize in music, Yi Yin and Hui Shi followed distinct paths yet were equally esteemed as worthy, and the two masters pursued different conduct yet were equally deemed humane.\n\nThe **Daoists** take mysterious transformation as their foundation, while the **Confucians** take virtue and education as their guiding principle. Among the nine streams, these two teachings are supreme. The Dao transforms the world through non-action, while Confucianism aids the customs through the Six Arts. Non-action takes clarity and emptiness as its heart, while the Six Arts take ritual and music as their instruction. If Confucian teachings were applied in a world of Great Unity, deceit and falsehood would sprout; if non-action were imposed upon the age of Cheng and Kang, chaos and strife would arise. Why? Because the purity or turbidity of the times differs, so too must the transformative influence adapt; past and present diverge, so governance and education should vary accordingly.\n\nFrom this perspective, though Confucian teaching does not attain the ultimate truth, it can guide the world; though Daoist thought fully grasps human nature, its disregard for ritual cannot remedy corruption. Thus, the worthy in governing the age should prioritize ritual education, while recluses seeking refuge in seclusion should devote themselves to non-action. In this way, both their pursuits will flourish, and their persons and reputations will be preserved intact.\n\n*Liuzi, Scroll Ten, concludes.*",
