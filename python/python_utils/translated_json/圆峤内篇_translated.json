Thus was established the opposing stance of East and West, and thus too was the Dao of their shared inheritance determined. The Western Star (Lu Qianxu’s alternate name, Lu Xixing, also called Chang Geng) and the Western Moon (Li Hanxu’s courtesy name, Tuanyang, also called Li Xiyue) illuminated one another, their radiance resplendent—how could this be mere chance?\n\nYet within the Daoist lineages, all know only of the *Fanghu Waishi* in circulation, while none are aware of the publication of the *Yuanqiao Neipian*. Why is this? For no other reason than that disciples and compilers of the Western Lineage failed to grasp the original intent behind the Patriarch Li’s writings. Lacking systematic organization, each piece bore its own title, and so the overarching name *Yuanqiao Neipian* was entirely submerged, its traces all but lost.\n\nMaster Chen Yingning, the late president of the Daoist Association, wrote prolifically with profound insight, yet even he was not immune to the irony of \"seeking the ox while riding it,\" lamenting in his works *Daoqiao Tan* (*Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures*), *Sanche Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*), and *Yuanqiao Neipian* that they had never been published and that he had not even seen a manuscript. The eminent scholar Li Daoshan, in his *Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu*, likewise noted: \"(The Patriarch) received the mandate of the Three Perfected Ones and composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern Elder Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Song of the Rootless Tree*... all of which were published. However, *The Inner Chapters of the Round Peaks*, *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures* remain unpublished.\" Alas!\n\nLittle did they realize the principle of correspondence between the two works—external alignment and internal alignment as inevitable complements. I racked my brains, exhaustively studying the classics, yet could not reconcile the discrepancy. Given the full title’s symmetry of inner and outer, how could it be that a monumental work of such grandeur had vanished without a trace, never to be published? Reluctantly, I turned again to *Hanxu Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of Hanxu*, a volume in the *Eastern Daoist Cultivation Library*). By chance, while poring over the preface to *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, I grasped the key. The preface was written by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu, who concealed their true names. It reads:\n\n\"One day, while wandering among Daoist temples, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi* (initially intended to parallel the Eastern Patriarch’s *Fanghu Waishi* and thus also called *Outer History*; later revised to *Inner Chapters* for symmetry, though it is the same work). Among them was *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures*, with the commentary on the *Daode Jing* being the most exhaustive. Appended was *Xuntu Jiu Ceng* (*Nine Layers of the Path*). Though brief, these few words suffice to reveal its essence and resolve the enigma.\"\n\nI then examined the preface by Master Pure Yang, which states:\n\n\"Hanxuzi was a transcendent talent... Upon hearing the teachings, he immediately gained insight and, roused by his own abilities, composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi* as a counterpart to Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has *Xuanfu Lun* (*On the Subtleties of the Mysterious*), this work has *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has *Jiuzheng Pian* (*Seeking Rectification*), this has *Xuntu Shuo* (*Discourse on the Path*). Most wondrous of all is the commentary on the *Daode Jing*, which serves as an eternal beacon, titled *Donglai Zhengyi* (*Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*), on par with Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo* (*Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence*).\"\n\nReading this, I could not help but clap in admiration, for at last the truth became clear. Thus, I have compiled the Patriarch Li’s various works into a single volume.\n\nHerein it is rightfully titled *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao*, fulfilling the long-cherished wish of Patriarch Li. Some say that the Western Patriarch Li Xiyue was the reincarnation of the Eastern Patriarch Lu Xixing. In the *Records of Spiritual Resonance* shown to me by Li, he himself did not deny this. Thus, history may cycle, human nature may reappear, and images may repeat. Reading the \"Three True Poems\" in the *Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*, how can one not marvel at the wonder!\n\nAmong them, Lu Xixing’s poem reads:\n*\"A single commentary can unlock the profound mysteries of the Dao,\nOnce more the purple qi arrives from the East.\nStrumming the zither, playing the flute—a true scholar,\nExpounding the Dharma, discoursing on sutras—a master of eloquence.\nI dwell in Square Pot, gazing upon the vast sea,\nYou ascend Yuanqiao, overshadowing Penglai.\nToday, seated together by the riverside pavilion,\nReciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly.\"*\n\nIs this praise for Li? Or self-aggrandizement? For two men—or one? The ancient Buddhas manifest in countless forms; Zhuangzi’s coffin was split once, twice, thrice. This startled the courage of the Tian clan of old—where now is the Prince of Chu?\n\nMy aspiration is to emulate the Three Recluses: I shall carry only this commentary on the *Daode Jing* and the *Ninefold Layer* chapter, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, their echoes drowning the clouds over the streams. I shall forget my name and age—this is my preface.\n\nWritten by Tianlezi Chen Yuzhao beneath the wondrous winds of Shanshui Mountain\n\n**Volume One: Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures**\nBy Changyi Mountain Recluse Li Hanxu\nCollated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian\n\n**Reader’s Guide to *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures***\n\n1. The author of this work is surnamed Li, named Xiyue, styled Hanxu, and also known as Tuanyang. A native of Leshan, Sichuan, he attained the Dao in the bingchen year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty.\n\n2. In China’s tradition of immortals’ Dao, there were originally two schools: the Southern and Northern. The Southern School began with Zhang Ziyang of Tiantai, Zhejiang, and the Northern School with Wang Chongyang of Zhongnan, Shaanxi. By the Jiajing era of the Ming, Lu Qianxu wrote the *Outer History of Square Pot*, greatly expounding the subtle Daoist winds, and was known as the Eastern School. The author of this work, Li Hanxu, was collectively regarded as the Western School. The Western School’s lineage transmission bears nine characters: *The Western Dao is universal; the great river flows east; the sea and sky are boundless.*\n\n3. Zhang Ziyang received the elixir method from an extraordinary figure in Chengdu but did not disclose his identity. At the same time, Wang Chongxi encountered Liu Haichan, who transmitted the oral formula of the Golden Elixir. Chongxi once remarked that no Daoist in the world could comprehend it except Zhang Pingshu. Thus, Lu Yanfu concluded that Ziyang must have also received transmission from Haichan. Haichan was a disciple of Zhongli Quan, the True Man of Zhengyang, and a fellow student of Lü Zu. Wang Chongyang’s collected works also refer to *\"Zhengyang as ancestor, Pure Yang as master, Haichan as uncle.\"* From this, it is evident that the Southern and Northern Schools share a common origin. Furthermore, Lu Qianxu of the Ming claimed to have met Lü Zu at the Grass Hall by the Northern Sea and personally heard the subtleties of the Dao. Li Hanxu of the Qing also encountered Lü Zu at a Chan monastery on Mount Emei, who secretly imparted the original sound. Thus, the four schools—Southern, Northern, Eastern, and Western—may all be considered transmissions from Lü Zu.\n\n4. The Northern School’s practice emphasizes tranquility. Yet among the Seven Perfected, Liu Zu was renowned for cultivating in brothels, unlike the desolate sitting of the True Man of Everlasting Spring. The Southern School’s oral formulas emphasize yin and yang. Yet among the Five Ancestors, Bai Yuchan was ordained from childhood, wandering as a cloud and water for life, unlike the Chan master Daoguang, who returned to lay life. In expounding Daoist texts, Lu’s works are refined and pure, while Li’s are complex. In explaining the *Human-Primordial Elixir Method*, Lu’s account is simple, while Li’s is intricate. From this, one may see that while the Dao is the same, methods may differ in skill. Though methods may align, oral instructions may vary in simplicity or complexity. It is for the scholar to harmonize and comprehend them, not to impose self-limitation.\n\n5. Zhang Ziyang attained the Dao during the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, approximately 830 years before the founding of the Republic. Wang Chongyang attained the Dao during the Dading era of Emperor Shizong of the Jin, approximately 740 years before the Republic. Lu Qianxu attained the Dao during the Longqing era of Emperor Muzong of the Ming, approximately 340 years before the Republic. Li Hanxu attained the Dao during the Xianfeng era of the Qing, approximately 60 years before the Republic.\n\n6. Li Hanxu’s works include *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Supreme*, *Annotations on the Daoist Ballad of the Rootless Tree*, and the compiled and edited *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, all of which have long circulated widely. Only *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* remain unpublished, and even the manuscript of *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* has not been seen. Now, *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures* and *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles* are published first to satisfy the longing of those devoted to the Dao.\n\n7. This book is a hand-copied manuscript from the collection of Mao Fuchu of Fujian, personally brought to Shanghai by Deng Yucang of Liancheng, Fujian, who entrusted its collation and publication to me. The costs of typesetting, printing, binding, and paper were jointly advanced by Deng Yucang and Zhang Zhuming through arrangements with the Alchemical Scripture Engraving Society. Only now can this work meet its readers—Mao, Deng, and Zhang have rendered no small service.\n\n8. This book has been corrected by me in approximately several dozen places, all of which were errors from successive transcriptions.\n\nThe errors herein lie merely in whether the phrasing is coherent or not, not in whether the theories are sound or flawed. The implications are relatively minor, so there is no need to compose a separate collation record, lest it occupy excessive space.\n\n9. At the time, Master Deng urged me to extract the essential points of this book for the benefit of readers. In my humble opinion, terms long customary in alchemical scriptures—such as *li* and *kan*, mercury and lead—are all figurative expressions. They may refer to the heart and kidneys, to spirit and *qi*, or even to male and female; it rests with the reader to delve deeply and grasp their meaning. Were one to insist on equating a given term with a specific entity, opinions would diverge along lines of wisdom and folly, and disputes over right and wrong would never cease. I fear this might inadvertently narrow the book’s scope of application, contravening the original intent of dissemination—better to leave it be.\n\n10. The most illuminating phrase in this book is “the other household.” For instance, Chapter Three states: *“To nourish my own mercury, one must employ the true lead of the other household.”* Chapter Five says: *“In inner refinement of the self, one uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household. In inner cultivation of the self, one likewise uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household.”* Chapter Eight declares: *“This lead is not the lead of returning elixir; it is the true fire of the other household.”* Chapter Ten observes: *“When the original root leaks away, essence, *qi*, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek it within oneself, one must seek it in the other.”* Chapter Seventeen notes: *“Original essence resides in my household; true essence resides in the other household.”* Chapter Eighteen states: *“The embodiment of supreme virtue, amply endowed by Heaven, need not seek it in the other household—hence it is called the Heavenly Origin.”* Chapter Twenty-Five says: *“I direct a speck of yin-fire essence to plant within the other household.”* And Chapter Twenty-Nine explains: *“Gathering and refining means gathering the yang lead of the other household to refine the *qi* of the child-pearl in my household.”* From the examples above, the references to “the other household” are indeed thorough. Yet precisely how to interpret these two words remains open to inquiry. If “the other household” refers to the *qi* within the kidneys, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are mistaken. If it refers to the Great Void beyond the body, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are likewise mistaken. If it refers to a partner of the opposite sex, then solitary practitioners devoted solely to meditation are mistaken. Readers must focus on these profoundly subtle points to truly perceive the Way in all its manifestations.\n\nWritten on the birthday of the Hundred Flowers in the mid-spring of the *dingchou* year of the Republic of China (1937), by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang, at the Abode of Myriad Wonders in Shanghai’s western outskirts.\n\n**Preface by Zhang**\nMy late great-uncle, Master Jingchuan, was fond of cinnabar arts, originally intending only to cultivate *qi* and refine his nature. As his understanding of the Dao deepened, he grew ever more inspired and diligent. He cherished every book on this path, preserving them all. Some were printed editions, others hand-copied—countless volumes, all sources of daily delight. In the late spring of *xinhai* (1931), as his final hour approached, he summoned my elder brother, Bochun, and said: *“What I have always loved are these few books on the Dao. When I die, take care to preserve them. In ten years, someone will come to claim them—do not begrudge them.”*\n\nBefore the appointed time arrives, do not lightly neglect cultivation. This is my final testament—pray do not forget it!”\n\nThough still a child, I too once heard these words. After my elder brother passed away, my younger brother Zhongkuan aired the books, and some, already gnawed by insects, had gone unnoticed. By chance, I came upon them and intended to make a fresh copy to serve as a future master text. Just as I began, my friend Liu Xuanfu paid a visit. Seeing the books, he asked, “Are you also tending to the Dao?”\n\nI explained my purpose, and he exclaimed, “Excellent! This endeavor of yours. I, too, have long cherished these books, though none have guided me in correcting their errors. Now, seeing your late uncle’s original copies—all distilled to essentials, refined from the obscure to the luminous—I am so delighted I cannot contain myself. Might I borrow a copy to transcribe? And if I make an extra one to share your labor, how would that be?”\n\nI had originally wished to keep them private, but recalling my uncle’s words—that when someone came to claim them, they should be handed over without hesitation—how could I begrudge lending a single copy, especially when he offered to transcribe an additional one as a gift? This volume is his transcription. From now on, the preservation of these books—is this not the aid of Xuanfu? And if Xuanfu indeed perfects his learning—is this not the fulfillment of the “ten years hence”? My uncle began it, my friend completed it, and I sit to enjoy the fruits—could anything be easier?\n\nThus, I set down these beginnings and ends to record them.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Zhang Richang of Meigao.\n\nShould any virtuous man or faithful woman, moved by good intention, undertake to publish and disseminate these two works—*Talks on the Dao’s Apertures* and *The Secret Essence of the Three Vehicles*—though they themselves may not cultivate in this life, may the Patriarchal Sovereign of Blessed Instruction and the Perfected Lord of Benevolent Teachings, in the life to come, guide them through manifold means, patiently enlighten them, and lead them to renounce the mundane and enter the Dao, escaping the sea of suffering and ascending the ranks of immortality. Should anyone study these two books in depth, pondering their subtleties and putting them into practice, the two Patriarchs will surely uplift them in secret, even in this very life. Though they may not attain the rank of Great Golden Immortal, they shall certainly be spared the torments of rebirth.\n\nThose who print and distribute these two books to fellow seekers, illuminating the great path and sparing them from heterodox and demonic ways, shall see their nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and their descendants shall never bear offspring of evil or lust.\n\nRespectfully added by Zhang Richang of Meigao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: Admonition to Fellow Practitioners**\n\nDeep in the night, seated in meditation—tranquil and natural.\nOn a rope bed or bamboo couch, cross-legged at the fifth watch.\nHaving sat, one rises again, at ease and content.\nThus, what has been attained is recorded by lamplight, and I say to my friends:\n\nWhen the night’s qi is clear and the breath is regulated, the spirit abides.\nIf one regulates as it is regulated, one avoids the pitfall of dull emptiness.\nIf one abides as it abides, one avoids the trap of clinging.\nAt such a time, neither forgetting nor forcing—seeming to forget, seeming to retain.\nSilent yet alert, perfectly round and luminous.\nWater naturally clears, fire naturally arises, spirit naturally merges, qi naturally converges, wind naturally aligns, the cart naturally moves, withdrawal naturally withdraws, advance naturally advances, addition naturally adds, retreat naturally retreats.\nOnly because this wondrous attainment is uniquely grasped does one wield control as if by heart—drowsiness naturally departs, distraction naturally gathers.\nCould anything be more joyous?\n\nYet to shun the lamp and feign sleep—I cannot bear to see it; it rests with your own discipline.\nTo lean on the desk and pretend wakefulness—I dare not partake in it; it rests with your own faith.\nTo close the eyes and indulge in thoughts—I cannot know it; it rests with your own elimination.\nThose who succumb to drowsiness in the clear night are not diligent in this practice.\nThose who fall into distraction in the clear night are not devoted to this practice.\nLacking diligence and devotion, one betrays the profound hopes of the Patriarchs.\nOur Dao is most wondrous and mysterious; those afflicted by such faults must amend them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Dialogue on Opening the Passes**\n\nSeveral friends asked Tuanyangzi:\n“Your discourse on nothingness may be called pure, authentic, and lucid—opening the apertures of the gateway. Yet I do not understand why the Sun Tao school holds that ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ should occur *before* foundation-laying, while Master Qianxu claims the ancient immortals never spoke of it, and now it has arisen. They further say, ‘Adding a snake’s leg is superfluous; a steed’s bones are priceless. The peril of the Great Dao lies in such men.’ Thus, they deem ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ contemptible. Since you share the same teacher, I beg you to explain.”\n\nTuanyangzi replied:\n“Alas! What Master Qianxu spoke of was not contempt, but lament for those unfortunate ones who have lost their primordial purity, compelling them to resort to such minor techniques. The virtue of the lower grade is effortless, not sought through scrutiny. A child whose primordial qi remains unbroken may cultivate purity and attain the immortal embryo without need of return or reversal—why open the passes? Thus, this is deemed a peril to the Great Dao. It is akin to the lament of the Most High: ‘When the Great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.’\n\nYet our generation takes saving others as its merit. Of those who transmit these teachings, how many retain the purity of childhood? Thus, expanding the apertures and opening the passes serve to unlock the mystery and clear the path, while returning to the origin and reverting to the root aid our kind and restore the true body. For those who begin the Dao in middle age, as long as they concentrate the spirit with method, regulate the breath with measure, and when the yin heel qi stirs, draw it into the crucible—neither forgetting nor forcing—then when the postnatal qi arises, they refine it again. The true mechanism will move of itself. Seizing its movement to guide it, one need not force the opening, for the pass opens naturally; one need not force the expansion, for the aperture expands naturally. Once the true qi ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, the path of the River Cart may be traversed. All occurs of itself, naturally.\n\nSeizing the moment between movement and stillness, one gently stokes the fire, driving it past the Tailbone Pass and reversing its flow to the Heavenly Valley. Naturally, essence is refined into qi, irrigating the Three Palaces. Thereafter, having obtained the wondrous medicine from without, one captures and restrains the true qi of the body, causing it to congeal without scattering. Then, in mutual affection and longing, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding her egg, the warmth unbroken, they settle together in the Yellow Court, coalescing into a cinnabar orange—this is called the ‘inner elixir.’ Thus, the work of the first stage is complete, the marvel of longevity attained, and the Way of preserving the form perfected.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the friend rejoiced and said, “Without your words, I would have nearly lost myself in longing. Though we are not quick of wit, we shall withdraw and cultivate accordingly.”\n\n**Chapter Three: An Exegesis on the Postnatal Methods**\n\nOf old, the postnatal methods were divided into only two stages: laying the foundation and refining the self. Yet Master Tao Cuncun further observed, “If a cultivator of the Dao does not first open the passes before hastily speaking of laying the foundation and refining the self, it is like scratching an itch from outside the boot—of no benefit whatsoever.” Thus, he divided the postnatal sequence into four stages: opening the passes, laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine, and refining the self.\n\nFearing that others might harbor doubts, I have composed this to clarify: the ancient division into two stages represents the broad outlines of the postnatal path, while the present division into four stages delineates its finer progression. Opening the passes clears the way for laying the foundation; obtaining the medicine supplies what the foundation requires; and refining the self completes the work of laying the foundation. Though four stages are now distinguished, they remain two in essence, and those two are ultimately one.\n\nAs the ancients said, “Subtle details and fine points cannot be transmitted except by a true teacher, nor spoken of except by a worthy disciple.” Though laying the foundation and refining the self do not belong to the highest alchemy, their finer stages exceed even what Master Tao described. The *Cantong Qi* states, “The inferior virtue practices it without ceasing.” Precisely because it does not cease, one perceives its many stages.\n\nDivergent teachings abound, and differing views arise, but all depend on the practitioner’s capacity for synthesis. The Perfected Sun Jiaoluan said, “Those who cultivate the body must first employ the crucible to open the passes.” He also said, “The crucible is the numinous father and numinous mother.” Why are the numinous father and numinous mother called the crucible? Because the parents who give birth to immortals and buddhas differ from ordinary parents, and so they are named the numinous father and numinous mother of the postnatal crucible.\n\nThe numinous father and numinous mother unite in reverse flow, whereas ordinary parents join in forward motion to sustain life. The method of reverse flow is constant from beginning to end. Once the crucible is established, spirit and qi intermingle, and accumulation deepens. As accumulation deepens, vigor surges. When vigor surges, the passes expand. When the passes expand, the path of reverse circulation opens, and the route of the River Chariot is traversed.\n\nYet moving the River Chariot is not the same as opening the passes. Opening the passes relies on postnatal true qi, while the River Chariot relies on postnatal metal and water. When the work reaches the stage of the River Chariot, the daily tasks of laying the foundation and refining the self become indistinguishable.\n\nQianxu said, “With ceaseless circulation and irrigation, over time it becomes perfectly refined. Qi fills the Three Fields, and above and below harmonize. This is what is meant by ‘constantly allowing qi to surge through and penetrate the joints, naturally filling the valley spirit with essence.’”\n\nI have often called the study of the postnatal path “nurturing the self.” If one carefully examines my words and fathoms its comprehensive stages, the Way of prolonging life and preserving the body will be attained.\n\nWhat is nurturing the self? The *Cantong Qi* states, “Within, nurture the self in tranquil emptiness.” This is the essential teaching of the postnatal path. The self is one’s inherent nature, the primordial spirit. Within refers to the inner realm, the state of emptiness. In emptiness, there is constant tranquility and peace; only when at peace can one deliberate, and only when tranquil can one respond.\n\nYet to still the spirit, one must regulate the breath with measure. One exhalation and one inhalation are called a single breath. It must follow its natural course, yet not be left entirely to its own devices. Zhuangzi said, “The true person breathes from the heels.” The heels signify unbroken continuity, an unceasing, subtle presence. Qi penetrates the Bubbling Spring, flowing without interruption.\n\nMy teacher said, “Let the inner breath follow the outer breath, and the outer breath follow the inner breath, breath after breath following breath after breath.” This is the subtlety of following the heels. When the inner breath exhales, the outer breath inhales; when the inner breath inhales, the outer breath exhales. Inner and outer breaths, reversing and aligning, generate one another. With measured opening and closing, a wondrous spontaneity arises, requiring no forced effort.\n\nThe ancients said, “If one asks how to begin laying the foundation, first understand the mysterious pass of the bellows.” To know the inner breath is to know the bellows. The alchemists say, “Exhale without passing the throat; inhale to return to the root.” This refers to the inner breath. How could mouth and nose breathing prevent it from passing?\n\nOnce the breath is regulated, one must also concentrate the spirit. Concentrating the spirit means remaining utterly still, inwardly illuminating the body. Yet this concentration of spirit and regulation of breath are not two separate practices. Regulating the breath gathers the spirit; gathering the spirit awakens awareness; awakened awareness generates qi; and qi, thus generated, is inwardly gathered and stilled. The golden crucible daily fills, primordial yellow and true lead unite, true qi surges into the heart, and is drawn to the Tailbone Pass. With a single thrust, the Three Passes open, the path of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl is revealed, and the Silver River may be drawn.\n\nYet the Way of nurturing the self is vast indeed. It encompasses regulating the breath, concentrating the spirit, gathering qi, and piercing the passes, while also including the work of laying the foundation and refining the self.\n\nShangyang said, “Treasure essence and enrich qi—this is nurturing the self. Face circumstances without attachment—this is refining the self.” Nurturing the self aids refining the self from within, while refining the self eliminates external distractions to nurturing the self. To refine the self without nurturing the self makes the elixir foundation difficult to complete. To nurture the self without refining the self makes the mercury nature difficult to stabilize. Together, nurturing the self and refining the self are one and the same Way.\n\nYet to nurture one’s own mercury, one must employ the other family’s true lead—the prior-heaven within the postnatal, the metal and water within the postnatal, the state of having qi without form. When true lead first arises, it steams between the two kidneys, and one immediately mobilizes the River Chariot to refine it, ascending from the Tailbone Pass to the Heavenly Valley, pouring sweet dew to return to the Yellow Court, sprinkling and irrigating the Three Palaces, using lead to restrain mercury. When qi transforms into fluid and retreats the yin tally, the flowing pearl no longer escapes.\n\nWhen fluid transforms into qi and advances the yang fire, the River Chariot rises once more.\n\nMoreover, refining one’s nature and cultivating the mind, externally eliminating worldly distractions, dwelling concealed amidst the marketplace, harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar—thus both body and mind become settled, and the inner mercury solidifies. Only then may one seek the eight ounces of prior-heaven to pair with the half-catty of postnatal, and the Reverted Elixir may be attained.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Laying the Foundation and Refining the Self**\n\nLaying the foundation and refining the self—these two are one. Yet there are minor and major foundations, external and internal refinement of the self. One must not be ignorant of this.\n\nWhat is the minor foundation? Drawing primordial yang into the inner crucible, sustaining embryonic breathing, then generating the postnatal medicine and performing the jade refinement. This is what the Sun Tao school calls \"once the foundation is laid, one dares to obtain the medicine; once the inner medicine congeals, one dares to refine the self.\"\n\nWhat is the major foundation? Nurturing the spirit pearl to produce external lead, with metal and water flowing abundantly, diligently practicing the marvels of the Celestial Cycle to complete the work of perfecting one’s nature. This is what the *Collected Explanations* refers to as \"opening the passes to pave the foundation’s path, obtaining the medicine to supply the foundation’s needs, and refining the self to conclude the foundation’s work.\"\n\nInternal refinement of the self concerns the work of the River Chariot and the jade fluid’s efficacy—this is the *Can Tong Qi*’s discourse on \"internally nurturing the self.\" External refinement of the self means all phenomena are empty, not a speck of dust clings—this is the ancient teaching of \"forgetting emotions when facing circumstances.\"\n\nIn essence, internal refinement is the major foundation, and the major foundation is nurturing the self. Nurturing the self still aids internal refinement, and internal refinement still requires external refinement. All elixir scriptures interweave the three and five, their words differing but their substance the same. Thus I say: laying the foundation and refining the self are one and two. May scholars skillfully comprehend this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**\n\nI previously stated that nurturing the self is the internal aid to refining the self, while refining the self removes the external disturbances to nurturing the self. This was provisionally distinguished for clarity, not to imply they are unrelated.\n\nYet there are indeed differences. External refinement of the self begins with refining in the face of circumstances, which differs from internal refinement and even from external nurturing of the self. Why? External refinement of the self refines the heart-mind to stabilize it. When the heart-mind is settled, the body is settled; when the body is settled, sensual desires cannot sway it, nor can wealth and profit dazzle it. Only then can true mercury be preserved, and the elixir’s foundation secured.\n\nAs for internal refinement of the self, it shares similarities with internal nurturing of the self. In elixir scriptures, refining the self means smelting mercury into cinnabar. Master Tao says: \"Refining the self is not mere empty refinement.\" Shangyang says: \"Cultivating the elixir is easy; refining the self is most difficult.\" The self here refers to the true fire of one’s mercury. One must first refine this true fire, subdue this true dragon, and command it at will, preventing it from bolting—only then can one subjugate the white tiger and obtain the true gold of the supreme treasure. Thus refining the self originally involves effort.\n\nThis effortful refinement of the self is internal refinement of the self, which is also internal nurturing of the self. Internal refinement of the self uses the other family’s lead to refine one’s own mercury, causing them to restrain and generate each other. Internal nurturing of the self also employs the other family’s lead to nurture one’s own mercury, enabling them to support and guard each other. Hence their shared meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**\n*(This chapter transmits the oral teachings of the Western School, renaming \"laying the foundation\" as \"nurturing the self\"—though the name differs, the principle remains the same.)*\n\nNurturing the self and refining the self form a continuous practice. Nurturing the self means treasuring essence and enriching qi—this is laying the foundation. Refining the self means forgetting emotions when facing circumstances—this is completing one’s nature.\n\nMust refining the self precede nurturing the self, or does nurturing the self first supply refinement? When essence and qi are cultivated, the earth of the self grows ever more solid and thick—hence the character *foundation* (基) is derived from earth (土). Thus laying the foundation is nurturing the self. When emotions and circumstances are tempered, the heart-mind of the self grows ever clearer and undying—hence the character *nature* (性) is derived from heart (心). Thus completing one’s nature must begin with refining the self.\n\nThough nurturing the self requires essence and qi, essence is guarded internally while qi comes from without. To strengthen one’s guard, one must employ the self; to await its arrival, one must employ the self. The Way of nurturing the self thus demands tranquility as its work.\n\nI distinguish two paths for nurturing the self: self-nurturing and mutual nurturing. Mutual nurturing pertains to essence and qi; self-nurturing pertains to tranquility.\n\nThough refining the self occurs amidst emotions and circumstances, emotions are inwardly attenuated while circumstances are outwardly emptied. When one is naturally content, the self must have something to delight in; when one is unburdened, the self must have something to uphold. The Way of refining the self thus demands both movement and stillness.\n\nI distinguish two aspects of refining the self: internal refinement and external refinement. External refinement is harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar; internal refinement is smelting mercury into cinnabar.\n\nA gatha says:\n*To know the true path of cultivation,*\n*First practice these two endeavors.*\n*Clarifying nurturing and refining the self,*\n*Helps one better read the immortal scriptures.*\n\nThe *Scripture* states: \"The inner heart should be alive; the outer heart should be dead.\" To enliven the inner heart, one must internally nurture the self. To extinguish the outer heart, one must externally refine the self. This is how I elucidate internal nurturing and external refinement of the self.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Postnatal Sequence**\n\nAfter the initial foundation, the postnatal serves as the marvelous function. Yet there is a postnatal that can be used, and one that cannot. The unusable postnatal does not even deserve the name—being utterly yin and turbid, it is unworthy of mention. Here, I discuss only the usable postnatal in sequence:\n\nFirst, the postnatal;\nSecond, the prior-heaven within the postnatal;\nThird, the prior-heaven;\nFourth, the prior-heaven within the prior-heaven.\n\nThe postnatal is the qi of the Yin Heel Vessel, the root of human life, which, when first stirred, becomes primordial essence. The practitioner strikes the bamboo to summon it, drawing it into the inner crucible, where it naturally refines essence into qi and opens the passes. This qi surges through the five viscera, suffuses the hundred bones, coils through the meridians, and returns to the Cinnabar Field. With concentrated spirit and regulated breath, one awaits the movement of the mechanism. When the mechanism stirs and the flute sounds, a single thread ascends—this is the prior-heaven within the postnatal. It is gathered with the sword, tuned with the zither, circulated with the River Chariot, and sealed in the Yellow Court—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid. With long and thorough practice, body and mind become steadfast; only then does one enter the chamber and approach the furnace to seek the prior-heaven. This prior-heaven is the primordial ancestral qi. First, one establishes the furnace and crucible by setting the true yin and true yang—kindred, sentient substances—each weighing eight ounces. Using the true qi of this furnace and crucible as a dharmic image, one revolves it through the celestial cycles to lure out the prior-heaven and immediately seize it. In less than half a quarter-hour, it coalesces into a single grain, adhering to the crucible—this is the lead mother, called the external elixir. The prior-heaven within the prior-heaven is so named because yang is born within lead, and the curtain’s light shines through. One gathers this most true yang qi to capture and subdue the essence-qi of one’s own body—this is what is meant by “When gold returns to the original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.” Thereafter, one nurtures and stabilizes it, daily revolving the yin tally and yang fire. By nurturing and fostering it, it transforms into the substance of golden liquid. Swallowing it into the five viscera is called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. After ingestion, it coalesces into the sacred embryo. With ten months of work complete, the yang spirit manifests. Beyond the reach of the five phases, one is titled a true immortal. To further ascend, one faces the wall for nine years—this is called refining the spirit to return to emptiness. Facing the wall means that within the moment, a ten-thousand-fathom cliff stands before one, untouched by worldly dust—it is not merely sitting facing a wall. The nine years refer to the nine revolutions. With the work of nine revolutions deepened, one attains a hundred million transformation bodies.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Inner and Outer Medicines**\n\nThe inner medicine serves to complete one’s nature; the outer medicine is needed to complete one’s destiny. For the practitioner to fulfill nature and destiny, one must first cultivate the inner medicine and then the outer medicine. This inner medicine is half a catty of mercury; this outer medicine is eight ounces of lead. One must first gather the outer medicine to capture the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the kidneys; this inner medicine is the essence of the heart. The postnatal work concludes here. As for establishing nature and destiny, one must first rely on the inner medicine to plant the outer medicine. This inner medicine is mercury within cinnabar; this outer medicine is lead within water. One must first refine the outer medicine and then the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the elixir mother; this inner medicine is the sacred embryo. The prior-heaven work concludes here. Yet one must understand the dual use of inner and outer: which is the medicine, and which is the elixir? The inner elixir is true mercury, the earth of the self, which returns to the gate of *li*; with time, it is refined into wondrous cinnabar. The outer elixir is true lead, the earth of *wu*, concealed in the door of *kan*; with time, it manifests as beautiful golden blossoms. To congeal the inner elixir, one must first use lead to restrain mercury—this lead is not the lead of the Returned Elixir but the true fire of the other household. To refine the outer elixir, one must first use mercury to welcome lead—this lead is not the lead of the congealed elixir but the one qi of the prior-heaven. Thus, congealing the elixir differs from returning the elixir. Congealing means coagulation: taking the qi of the other household to coagulate the qi of one’s own household. The transformation occurs within the postnatal crucible, inseparable from the celestial fire-tending, and only then can one succeed. Returning means restoration: gathering the gold of *dui* to restore the gold of *qian*. The transformation occurs within the prior-heaven crucible, requiring the union of kindred yin and yang to achieve completion. Congealing the elixir completes the inner elixir; returning the elixir employs the outer elixir. The inner elixir is the yin elixir—mercury is originally yin within yang. The outer elixir is the yang elixir—lead is yang within yin. The earthly origin is the outer elixir, whose salvific and bestowing functions are all directed toward others. The human origin is the inner elixir, whose principles of nature and destiny are all directed toward the self. There is more one must know: the inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is also called the inner medicine because its transformation occurs within. The outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet the Golden Elixir is also called the outer medicine because its transformation occurs without. This is the great elixir that encompasses both inner and outer. There is also what one must know: the outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet there is an outer medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When the great *kan* and *li* intersect, the River Chariot revolves, transforming qi into liquid, which descends to the Yellow Chamber—this is also called the outer medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. The inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet there is an inner medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When one establishes the prior-heaven foundation, the Crimson Palace transforms liquid, which flows back to the primordial sea, and the liquid reverts to qi—this is also called the inner medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. This is the work of purity and quiescence that encompasses both inner and outer. The distinctions between elixirs and medicines are fully recorded here for the learner’s benefit.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Resemblance of Medicinal Substances**\n\nIn the teachings of the prior-heaven and postnatal, the medicinal substances have layers that closely resemble one another, differing only in scale. Now, I will discuss those that resemble each other. The postnatal *kan* and *li* serve to lay the foundation of the elixir; the prior-heaven *kan* and *li* serve to establish the foundation of the elixir. The postnatal lead and mercury serve to congeal the minor elixir; the prior-heaven lead and mercury serve to return the great elixir. Three years of refining the self serve to complete one’s nature; nine years of facing the wall serve to complete one’s destiny. The postnatal *kan* and *li* refer to the union of original spirit and original qi to lay the foundation of the elixir, generating the minor medicine. The prior-heaven *kan* and *li* refer to the union of true yin and true yang to establish the foundation of the elixir (that is, the elixir mother), generating the great medicine.\n\nPostnatal lead and mercury refer to the golden crucible refining the generated medicine—this medicine is external lead. The river chariot transports and restrains the flowing pearl—the flowing pearl is internal mercury. When lead and mercury constrain each other, the minor elixir is congealed. Prior-heaven lead and mercury refer to the union of like yin and yang to form *wu* earth—*wu* earth is external lead. Harmonizing the fire timing with *ji* earth—*ji* earth is internal mercury. When lead and mercury meet, the great elixir returns. During the refinement of the minor elixir, the abdomen feels warm and intoxicated. Then, borrowing the *zi-wu* cycle, one gradually gathers and congeals, causing lead to subdue mercury, forming yin cinnabar. After the great elixir congeals, the furnace glows with enduring redness. Then, borrowing the external furnace’s talismanic fire, diligently increasing and decreasing, one causes lead to dry and mercury to manifest, forming yang cinnabar.\n\nRefining the self to complete one’s nature means nurturing yin cinnabar. Internally, one treasures essence and enriches qi; externally, one faces the mirror and forgets emotion—thus both body and mind are firmly established. \"Three years\" signifies the meaning of \"three months without deviation.\" Facing the wall to complete one’s destiny means nurturing yang cinnabar. One must ensure both form and spirit are wondrous, truly shattering the void—thus transformations become boundless. \"Nine years\" signifies the meaning of the \"ninefold great return.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten: Mutual Nourishment of the Three Treasures**\nThe *Xinyin Jing* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" These are the supreme treasures of cultivation. Their ceaseless generation and transformation mutually nourish one another—this is elucidated for the scholar. Practicing the Dao of reverse cultivation transforms essence into qi, and qi into spirit. Practicing the Dao of sequential cultivation generates spirit from qi, and qi from essence.\n\nOne asks: Why reverse refinement? Since the original root leaks, essence, qi, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek them within, one must seek them without. Seeking them without is reverse refinement. Essence transforming into qi means this essence, residing in the yin heel vessel, reversely enters the purple palace to be refined—thus it transforms into qi. Qi transforming into spirit means this qi, residing in the yang furnace, reversely enters the yellow court to be refined—thus it transforms into spirit.\n\nThough this reverse refinement begins with essence, the sequential refinement begins with spirit. The two have a mutual necessity and do not conflict. To reverse-refine original essence, one must first concentrate the spirit. When spirit is concentrated, qi gathers; when qi gathers, essence is generated. For when spirit and qi unite, they naturally produce celestial essence. This essence is the water of the celestial one, *ren* in *kan*, also called mother qi or external essence. The practitioner uses mother qi to cultivate child qi, and external essence to replenish internal essence—this is the work of like kind. Child qi is heart qi. Internal essence is heart essence. Postnatal cultivation proceeds from external to internal, so one must first refine the external medicine to return to the internal medicine.\n\nThere is also the principle of spirit transforming into essence, and essence into qi. This refers to the crimson palace transforming fluid, which flows back to the original sea, the fluid then transforming into qi, later transported by the river chariot. There is further the principle of qi generating essence, and essence generating spirit. This refers to white clouds ascending to court, sweet dew descending, drawing out the yang of *kan* to replenish the yin of *li*.\n\nExcellent indeed! The words of Immortal Tao: \"Knowing the internal but not the external, one cannot open the passes. Gathering the external but not the internal, one cannot secure the root.\" Those who embody this understand the wondrous mutual nourishment of essence, qi, and spirit.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Five Passes of Refining Practice**\nElixir methods divide into three passes: refining essence, refining qi, and refining spirit. Yet the depths of cultivation truly exceed these three. If the stages are incomplete, one risks skipping levels. Let us now discuss them.\n\nThe first pass refines essence, requiring the crucible. One unites original yellow to copulate, transforming the golden crow to ascend—thus essence transforms into qi. The second pass refines qi, requiring clarity on *zi-wu*. One draws out the yang within *kan* to replenish the yin within *li*—thus qi transforms into spirit. Both foundation-laying and elixir-returning employ such methods, differing only in the scale of medicine, crucible, and furnace.\n\nAs for the Dao of refining spirit, there are three passes: first, refining spirit to complete one’s nature; second, refining spirit to complete one’s destiny; third, refining spirit to return to emptiness. Refining spirit to complete one’s nature is the Dao of refining the self with jade fluid. Lead subdues mercury, congealing the elixir foundation. Internally, true fire is unceasing; externally, the *zi-wu* cycle gathers and congeals. Thus mercury is refined into yin cinnabar. Refining spirit to complete one’s destiny is the Dao of refining form with golden fluid. Lead returns to restrain mercury, congealing the fetal infant. Internally, true fire glows enduringly; externally, yin and yang are applied, daily increasing and decreasing. Thus mercury is dried into yang cinnabar.\n\nRefining spirit to return to emptiness ascends further, uniting with the Dao in truth. One moves the spirit to the upper courtyard, sits upright with a tranquil mind, directly merging with the great void to universally illuminate the great thousand worlds. Thus the Dharma body is perfected, the śarīra radiates light, and emanations respond boundlessly. As the saying goes: \"Children and grandchildren, a hundred thousand myriad transformations.\" At this stage, responding to the moment to establish merit, the body returns to the Three Purities, and the Dao transcends the nine ancestors.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Stages of Medicine Production**\nMedicines have three stages: first, emerging from non-being into being; next, entering from being into non-being; finally, producing being from non-being.\n\nEmerging from non-being into being refers to postnatal lead fire. Though generated externally, it is formless and without substance—this is the initial arising of golden qi. Entering from being into non-being refers to sending it to the western region.\n\nThough cultivated from within, it is utterly empty and void—this is the cavernous yang realm of Kun’s domain.\n\nProducing being from non-being corresponds to the union of Kan and Dui. The primordial qi of the precelestial arises from the formless. From formlessness, wondrous form is born; from insubstantiality, numinous substance is generated. Seek it in the second watch, unite it in the fourth watch, and the golden elixir is accomplished, the sacred embryo congealed, the nurturing complete, and the yang spirit manifests.\n\nDisciples often fail to distinguish between \"emerging from non-being into being\" and \"producing being from non-being,\" which differ by ten thousandfold. Thus, I have set forth this explanation to clarify.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen: The Stages of Medicinal Refinement**\n\nMedicines have three stages: first, taking the external medicine to refine the internal medicine; next, using the internal medicine to cultivate the external medicine; finally, consuming the external medicine to unite with the internal medicine.\n\nTaking the external medicine to refine the internal medicine refers to the work of laying the foundation and refining the self. This external medicine pertains to the refinement of the lesser medicine, the stage of refining essence into qi.\n\nUsing the internal medicine to cultivate the external medicine pertains to the work of the Qian-Kun crucible and vessel. This internal medicine is the true mercury at the moment of dispersing essence and sowing the seed.\n\nConsuming the external medicine to unite with the internal medicine refers to welcoming the lead to refine the mercury, the work of the mother recognizing the child. This external medicine is the great medicine. Seized suddenly, it induces profound intoxication; possessed eternally, it bestows longevity. Harmonized and firmly sealed, it becomes the sacred embryo. When the work of nurturing is complete, it becomes the sage—this is the moment when the great man’s merit is accomplished and his name established.\n\nSomeone asked Tuanyang: “Master Shangyang said, ‘The internal medicine completes nature to congeal the elixir; the external medicine completes life to return the elixir.’ Thus, disciples should first refine the internal medicine before proceeding to the external. Why then does Yingchanzi claim that ‘one must begin with the external medicine before turning to the internal’?”\n\nTuanyang replied: “You conflate the postcelestial external medicine with the precelestial external medicine, regarding both simply as ‘external medicine.’ Yet the postcelestial external medicine precedes *gui*, while the precelestial external medicine follows *gui*. Though their names are the same, their realities differ. Clinging to the letter and fixating on appearances—this is the common flaw of those who lack the master’s oral transmission.”\n\nThus, I set forth this three-tiered exposition to elucidate the matter.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Two Kinds of Cinnabar**\n\nIn the study of the postcelestial, one governs mercury with lead to form cinnabar. This cinnabar is the treasure of the sevenfold return, utterly pure and flawless—the Lesser Returned Elixir.\n\nIn the study of the precelestial, one extracts lead to augment mercury, forming cinnabar. This cinnabar is the supreme treasure of the ninefold transmutation, its golden radiance enfolding the body—the Greater Returned Elixir.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Spirit and Qi, Nature and Life**\n\nThe postcelestial Dao pertains to spirit and qi. The precelestial Dao pertains to nature and life. Though nature and life resemble spirit and qi, they are in truth far removed. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* states: “It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor.” These words merit deep reflection.\n\nDisciples who grasp this distinction should complete the postcelestial with spirit and qi, and complete the precelestial with nature and life. Why is this? That which nature commands is called life—these two are originally one. This is the heart-method of establishing life.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* says: “Different names arise from the same source, yet few know this; both are profoundly profound, the essential mechanism.” Here, life is the differing name, while nature is the shared source. Lead is the differing name, while mercury is the shared source. Thus, the lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor. This single flavor—lead—originates from the single flavor of mercury.\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: “Through non-desire, observe its mystery; through desire, observe its aperture.” Observing mystery and observing aperture—this is the profoundly profound mechanism. One should attain utmost stillness and desirelessness to observe its mystery, which is the work of stabilizing nature. Yet when the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, the primordial True Unity qi emerges from emptiness—indeed, there is an aperture.\n\nThough these two bear different names, both originate from the Supreme Ultimate, which is their shared source. By observing the non-being, one attains the mystery, gaining one profundity. By observing the being, one attains the aperture, gaining another profundity. Profound beyond profundity—nature resides herein, and life resides herein.\n\nNature originates from Heaven’s mandate, while life originates from the fulfillment of nature. Heaven forms things through qi, yet principle is also bestowed. Thus, mandate is conferred upon human nature, hence it is said: “What Heaven confers is called nature.” Humans create things through principle, and qi begins to arise. Thus, life is established through nature, hence it is said: “Fulfill nature to attain life.”\n\nIn Heaven, principle emerges from qi; in the Dao, qi emerges from principle. When principle emerges from qi, qi is prioritized. This qi is the harmonious, transforming qi of primordial chaos. Humans receive this qi to form their bodies, after which principle has a dwelling—thus, this qi is to be prized.\n\nWhen qi emerges from principle, qi is again prioritized. This qi is the primordial True Unity qi. Yin receives the yang radiance, and within the lead seed, another yang arises—thus, this qi is even more prized. The Dao of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir cannot be accomplished without this single lead qi; those who recognize this treasure it.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Direct Pointers to the Precelestial**\n\nThe precelestial transcends the postcelestial, being the most primordial and original, the root and the source—it is the venerable designation of the singular qi. Yet this precelestial qi has three aspects, and the term “precelestial” has two meanings.\n\nWhat are these two meanings? The first precedes Heaven. The second originates from Heaven.\n\nThat which precedes Heaven is earlier than Heaven, the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth. This qi encompasses the form of primordial chaos, initially called Supreme Non-Being. Before Heaven and Earth divided, this qi already existed. This is its precedence over Heaven—hence, it is called precelestial. This is the first aspect.\n\nThat which originates from Heaven arises from Heaven, the precelestial that generates humans and all things. This qi contains the image of harmonious fusion, latent within the Great Void. Before humans and things were produced, this qi already existed. This is its origination from Heaven—it is also called precelestial. This is the second aspect.\n\nAs for the precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas, it encompasses both preceding meanings. This qi emerges from emptiness, called the Supreme Unity. The Golden Elixir relies upon it to be completed—termed the Ancestor, the Origin, the Embracer of Reality. It may be likened to the precelestial that precedes Heaven and the precelestial that originates from Heaven, forming three corresponding aspects. Thus, it is also designated as precelestial.\n\nThe elixir scriptures of past sages, whether speaking of the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth or the precelestial that generates humans and things, are without exception metaphors for this precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas.\n\nShould one inquire about the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is born of the Supreme Ultimate. As the *Classic* states: “There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Nameless, it is forcibly called the Dao.” It is the ancestor of all phenomena, the origin of the two great powers—without form, without shape, without sound, without scent. Initially, it is profoundly obscure, beyond the reach of the Five Agents. Yet again, it is faintly discernible, the qi arising naturally. When clarity and turbidity separate, and the Dark and Yellow distinguish themselves, then Qian and Kun settle into position, and Heaven and Earth become manifest.\n\nShould one inquire about the precelestial that generates humans and things, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is governed by Heaven and Earth. One becomes three, and three become one. The one is qi; the three are essence, qi, and spirit. All living beings are forged through these three-in-one.\n\nIn speaking of essence, it is the essence of the Two and Five. In speaking of qi, it is the qi of yin and yang. In speaking of spirit, it is the spirit of emptiness. The spirit of emptiness interacts with the qi of yin and yang. The essence of the Two and Five is co-generated with the qi of yin and yang. Its qi is numinous—hence, it is spirit. Its qi is wondrous—hence, it is essence.\n\nAbove coiling and below bounding—this is qi, and within it lies the spirit and essence of Heaven and Earth. Humans receive this qi to be born, which is then called the primordial qi of Heaven. Yet this qi may be clear or turbid, firm or yielding. Those who receive the firm become male; those who receive the yielding become female. Those who receive the clear become wise; those who receive the turbid become dull.\n\nBefore father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. As essence and blood intermingle and the embryo is fully formed, this qi already pervades the womb in undifferentiated unity. At this time, there is no spirit—qi serves as spirit. At this time, there is no essence—qi serves as essence. When qi is concentrated and securely contained, it is essence.\n\nThis is the primordial qi, primordial essence, and primordial spirit—the precelestial endowment for human birth. If a youth encounters a master and receives the method, preserving this purity through cultivation, they may aspire to become a Daoist immortal of non-action.\n\nThere is also true qi, true spirit, and true essence—the precelestial foundation for internal alchemy. If scholars fail to recognize the true mechanism, they will have no starting point and cannot attain this supreme treasure.\n\nNow, the precelestial: it cannot be used when seen, and cannot be seen when used. It is what alchemists seek through emptiness and stillness, refining the real by means of the provisional, generating being from non-being. At this stage, the Way of three, two, and one naturally divides and unites.\n\nSpirit becomes the spirit beyond spirit; essence becomes the essence of utmost essence; qi becomes the true unity of qi—these are the three. The spirit beyond spirit is spirit in its most spiritual form—this is the nature of the Dragon. The essence of utmost essence is essence refined to its purest—this is the essence of the Tiger. These are the two. As for the true unity of qi, it is the true lead for completing life, uniting the Dragon and Tiger’s nature and temperament into one, called the Mother of the Elixir—this is the one.\n\nIngesting this true unity causes the Three Corpses and Five Thieves to flee, filling the six palaces of the body with eternal spring. How could this compare to the qi, essence, and spirit of birth? How could it be approached by the postcelestial qi, essence, and spirit?\n\nThe postcelestial consists of the qi of breathing, the spirit of thought, and the essence of intercourse—three things that can be heard, seen, measured, and inferred. These serve the body after birth, hence they are called postcelestial.\n\nWhen a person is in the womb, there is only a single point of primordial qi, with no qi of breathing. Only after ten months, when the fetus is complete and leaves the mother’s body, does it borrow the orifices of mouth and nose to externally absorb the harmony of Heaven and Earth—thus the origin of breathing qi. From this, the spirit of thought also arises, relying on this qi to enter. It lodges in the body as a temporary abode, seizing the dwelling to reside within. This spirit is the seed of karmic rebirth, arriving first at birth and departing first at death, ceaselessly abandoning the old and seeking the new.\n\nWhen an infant first emerges, its initial cry subtly reveals the suffering of rebirth. As it is nurtured and grows, the acquired spirit takes control, emotions and desires entangle, and the primordial qi gradually dissipates. Even the qi of breathing never ceases for a moment—how tragic!\n\nAs for postcelestial essence, it is not brought at birth nor taken at death. Only as the body’s primordial qi gradually fills and overflows, reaching fifteen years of age, does yang reach its peak and yin begin to grow, yin lengthening as yang wanes. This causes the undifferentiated qi to transform into the passions of intercourse. Intercourse involves both union and sensation—with union and sensation, there is essence; without them, there is none. This essence is compelled by desire and transformed from qi and blood.\n\nThere are also those who lose essence through dream-induced sensations or dream intercourse, which occurs when qi and blood are unstable and the kidney’s gate cannot retain it. This is the essence of intercourse.\n\nI urge those who study the Dao to seek only the precelestial and not the postcelestial, so that the supreme medicine may be obtained. Even if one does not dare to immediately pursue the highest grade but instead builds the foundation and refines the self, one must refine primordial essence into primordial qi, and primordial qi into true lead, making the postcelestial precelestial to complete the half-pound of postcelestial substance. Then one may seek this supreme precelestial.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: On Spirit, Qi, and Essence**\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" These are the wondrous substances of internal alchemy. The most exalted among them are primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence—true essence, true qi, and true spirit.\n\nWhat is primordial? The precelestial. What is true? Also the precelestial. The primordial precelestial is born of the imperial descent—this is the celestial primordial of youth. The true precelestial is accomplished through the great Dao—this is the human primordial of our kind.\n\nIf one cannot cultivate the celestial primordial, must they not rely on the human primordial?\n\nSome may ask: \"The celestial primordial is how Heaven and Earth, through yin-yang and the Five Phases, transform and generate beings, forming shapes with qi and endowing them with principle. The qi that gives life to humans is primordial qi. Before father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. The Confucians speak of 'Heaven giving birth to the multitudes, with things and patterns'—this refers to it. This qi is most numinous; being numinous, it has spirit, which is primordial spirit. This qi is most clear; being clear, it is utmost essence, which is primordial essence.\n\nBefore the embryo is formed, there is only primordial qi within, with no postcelestial breathing qi. Only after ten months, when the form is complete and the mouth and nose exist, does it follow the mother’s breathing to externally absorb the great harmony of Heaven and Earth. The karmic yin spirit also relies on this breathing to enter. Thus, the postcelestial spirit and qi are both complete, and the infant immediately cries upon birth. Fortunately, the mouth cannot speak, the eyes cannot smile, and there is no knowledge or perception. The primordial qi remains undifferentiated, without thought or deliberation, rendering the yin spirit useless.\"\n\nThe primordial qi relies on the primordial spirit for mutual nourishment. By the age of sixteen, when spirit is complete and qi is full, yang reaches its peak and yin arises, giving birth to postcelestial generative essence. Desire-fire blazes, and the yin spirit indulges its will. Thus, those of youthful purity and supreme virtue, if they encounter a teacher, may preserve their celestial primordial body through pure cultivation, becoming effortless celestial immortals. Once postcelestial forces take hold, the primordial recedes.\n\nOne might ask: If the celestial primordial is so easily cultivated, why not take children into the mountains to realize fruition, making them immortals at once? The answer: A fine question! Heaven and Earth generate humanity to establish the Dao of Heaven and enact the virtue of Heaven. Therefore, those who inwardly preserve perfection need not refrain from outwardly fulfilling their human destiny, thereby expanding their creative transformation. Otherwise, though the immortal Dao may flourish, the human Dao will surely wane. Thus, after following the natural course of human life, the method of reversing birth to become an immortal is emphasized. This is the great Dao of the human primordial—how it nurtures all things without omission, encompassing Heaven and Earth without overstepping.\n\nThe key lies in recognizing this essence, qi, and spirit.\n\nSomeone asks: \"What is the difference between primordial spirit and true spirit?\"\nAnswer: The primordial spirit is turbid and indistinct. The true spirit is bright and luminous. One lies hidden in chaos, without light; the other, refined through tempering, becomes useful. Confucians speak of \"tranquility, stability, and the ability to contemplate\"; Buddhists, of \"entering deeply into the great prajñā\"; Daoists, of \"supreme stillness generating wisdom.\" This true spirit is perfect knowing and perfect awareness. Thus, even children may cultivate purity, while ordinary people must engage in quiet refinement to attain the true spirit of the perfected.\n\nAnother asks: \"What is the difference between primordial essence and true essence?\"\nAnswer: Primordial essence resides in my domain; true essence resides in the other’s domain. That in my domain is the undifferentiated qi of the Crimson Palace, accumulated over time to generate numinous fluid. That in the other’s domain is the vigorous qi of the Flowery Pond, what the *Awakening to Reality* calls the \"primary essence.\" On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, when metal qi is full and water’s tide arises, it precisely aligns with the true signal of the two equinoxes. If cultivators recognize this essence, drawing it in with a single breath, they may instantly attain celestial immortality—it is no ordinary thing.\n\nAnother asks: \"What is the difference between primordial qi and true qi?\"\nAnswer: Primordial qi is what children receive from Heaven—what is called the qi that forms the body, increasing with the years. True qi, however, is not like this. The primordial, original ancestor arises from within emptiness and nonbeing. Only with the oral instructions of a true teacher, first establishing the cauldron and vessel of qian and kun, harmonizing the true dragon and true tiger, and uniting true yin and true yang, does it coalesce into the mother of lead in half a double-hour. Yang born within lead becomes true qi. Thus, Heaven uses primordial qi to generate humans and things, while the Dao uses true qi to generate immortals and buddhas. The human primordial method of refining qi seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth—no easy feat.\n\nUpon hearing Master Tuanyang’s discourse on the human primordial’s refinement of qi to seize Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation, someone asks about the difference between the celestial primordial and the human primordial. Tuanyang replies: Listen, and I will tell you. \"What Heaven commands is called nature\"—principle emerges from qi: this is the celestial primordial. \"Fully realizing nature to reach destiny\"—qi emerges from principle: this is the human primordial. Supreme virtue is effortless, not seeking through observation, a practice of purity and stillness—this is the celestial primordial. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing, the path of return—this is the human primordial. Those of supreme virtue receive Heaven’s bounty in abundance, yet still engage in pure cultivation. They must refine primordial qi and primordial spirit into utmost clarity and emptiness, transforming them into perfect equanimity and perfect awakening, only then fully realizing the principle of the celestial primordial. Thus, the celestial primordial is not a ready-made matter for those of supreme virtue. Those who take supreme virtue as the celestial primordial do so because their original self remains unharmed, naturally close to the celestial primordial.\n\nThose of inferior virtue are the most numerous among people, so the wondrous truth of return is taught first. They must forge yin elixir and yang elixir into a single mass, refining them into supreme nonbeing and supreme emptiness, only then fully realizing the Dao of the human primordial. Thus, the human primordial is not the ready-made body of inferior virtue. Those who take inferior virtue as the human primordial do so because their own and others’ brilliance is manifest, hence it is called the art of the human primordial.\n\nThe original body of supreme virtue is endowed with both nature and destiny. The wondrous function of inferior virtue fully realizes both nature and destiny. Yet both rely on a single qi for transformation. Thus, humans attain the primordial true unity of qi to become immortals, just as Heaven bestows yin-yang and five-phase qi to become human. The elixir path seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth because it is one with the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Further Discussion on Essence, Qi, and Spirit**\n\nIn the original body of supreme virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all called \"primordial,\" for what is received from Heaven is abundant, and there is no need to seek from the other’s domain—hence it is called the celestial primordial. In the practice of inferior virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all named \"true,\" for what is taken from humanity is plentiful, and it cannot be sought from one’s own domain—hence it is called the human primordial. Yet in this human primordial practice, there are wondrous subtleties of gathering the primordial and secret mechanisms of seeking the primordial. Thus, those who use humanity to return to Heaven gather primordial essence to supplement primordial qi, refine primordial qi to nourish primordial spirit, and refine primordial spirit to become true spirit—then the postcelestial work is complete. Using true spirit to generate true qi, using true qi to seek true essence, seizing true essence to form true lead—then the primordial work is complete. When one returns to the origin and embraces the primordial to guard the One, it becomes entirely identical to the practice of supreme virtue.\n\nThose who cultivate inferior virtue but do not reach the realm of nonaction, or embrace supreme virtue but do not investigate the mystery of nonaction, cannot ingest the celestial primordial or attain the rank of celestial immortal.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen: The Order and Reversal of Nature and Life**\nThe principles of nature and life possess both order and reversal. The ordered completion of nature and life is bestowed by Heaven, wherein one encompasses two. The reversed completion of nature and life is cultivated by man, wherein one unites two. That which encompasses two—qi is endowed with principle, and when qi and principle merge, nature and life become wholly integrated. That which unites two—water is raised to extinguish fire, and when water and fire interact, nature and life endure forever.\n\nWhat Heaven commands is called nature; within life resides nature—this is ordered completion. Mencius spoke of form and appearance as Heaven’s nature, for what is commanded possesses this form, and thus possesses this nature. Innate knowledge and innate ability are both lodged within the commanded form. To fully realize nature is to reach life; within nature, life is cultivated—this is reversed completion. The perfected person plants the life-treasure with the fire of spirit, for what is realized in nature possesses this spirit, and thus possesses this life. In response to stimuli and summons, all arises from the radiance of the spirit within nature.\n\nNow we know that supreme virtue is pure and still, preserving the way of ordered completion to congeal the immortal embryo—this is Heaven perfecting man. We also know that inferior virtue returns and refines the way of reversed completion to congeal the sage embryo—this is exhausting man to unite with Heaven. Let those who study the Dao understand this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Mysterious Pass of the One Aperture**\nThe mysterious pass of the one aperture is born from emptiness and nothingness. It does not reside among the five viscera or six bowels, nor anywhere in the limbs. Speaking of its name: this pass is a wondrous mechanism, hence it is called the *mysterious pass*. This aperture is the place where all methods return to the One, solitary and without counterpart, hence it is called the *one aperture*. In a single phrase to encompass it: it is the *center*.\n\nThe center lies between above and below, yet it does not lie between above and below—for it is both dead and alive. What is dead? To take the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field as this center is dead. What is alive? To concentrate spirit and gather qi, revealing this center, is alive. In dead terms, it is called the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. In living terms, it is reckoned as the mysterious pass of the one aperture. Thus it is said: born from emptiness and nothingness. The true mechanism is directly revealed. Those who attain it must keep it secret.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Further Discussion of the Mysterious Pass**\nThe mysterious pass is the numinous radiance where spirit and qi unite. When first glimpsed, the mysterious pass flickers without constancy. When first entered, it is indistinct and without support, for spirit and qi have only just merged and cannot yet solidify. Only when their embrace becomes pure and familiar, and the heart dies without departing, does one begin to recognize that within the mysterious pass, self and other are forgotten, and even spirits and gods cannot fathom it. (Beyond this, one cannot evade impermanence.) Here, it is utterly pure and undifferentiated, serene and soaring. Within this, the mysteries transform endlessly, beyond description. No wonder its names are many—each person’s perception differs. Each names it according to their vision, and titles it according to their use. Ancient immortals kept it secret and unspoken; only after receiving the transmission with the touch of a hand to the crown could one be taught. Even then, their instructions amounted to no more than: it is neither heart nor kidney. I say it is also not the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. Now I reveal it further—let those who recognize it keep it secret.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Method of the Two Apertures**\nIn the alchemical tradition, there is one cavity, and this cavity has two apertures. Its center is hollow, while its two ends are perforated, hence it is called the *cavity of two apertures*. The master’s transmission—“mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture”—refers precisely to this realm. It is the place where the Conception and Governor Vessels merge, where yin and yang converge, the land where the Crow and Hare come and go.\n\nWithin the one cavity and two apertures lies the method of practice—this method is most profoundly mysterious. The *Triple Concordance* states: “When the upper is closed, it is called *having*; when the lower is closed, it is called *nothing*. *Nothing* serves the upper, where the power of spirit resides. This method of the two apertures also requires the qi of metal.” These few lines exhaust the method of practice.\n\nUpper and lower are Heaven and Earth. *Closed* means dark union. *Having* and *nothing* are the wondrous apertures. *Called* refers to naming and describing. One above, one below—all are concealed within this cavity. Whether *having* or *nothing*, all reside within this cavity. When one attains emptiness and preserves stillness, at the time when Heaven and Earth darkly unite, one may observe its wonder. The wondrous *having*—though indescribable, it may be named, hence it is called *having*. This is what is meant by: “In the profound and obscure, there is essence; within it, there is sincerity.” To observe the aperture through *nothing*—the aperture of emptiness and nothingness—though describable, it cannot be described, hence it is called *nothing*. This is what is meant by: “Within it, things return to no-thing.”\n\n*Nothing* serves the upper—not as an empty return, but as the true lead of the primordial. This is what Laozi spoke of: “The form of the formless, the image of the imageless. One meets it but does not see its head; one follows it but does not see its rear.” In the elixir method, *nothing* serving the upper is to return *nothing* to *having*. What is meant by *serving*? Who offers reverence? Who presents the offering? When the power of spirit humbly resides above, its qi naturally returns—*returning* is *serving*. The only fear is that above, there is no power of spirit. *Above* refers to the region above the Yellow Court; *power* refers to the power of humility and softness. This is what the *Token* meant by: “Reversal is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue.”\n\nTo attain emptiness, one employs the Dao; to seek lead, one employs virtue. Virtue acts, while the Dao does not—one must not fail to understand this method. The two apertures are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the place where the golden elixir is transformed and born. If one knows and practices the method of pursuit and absorption within the one cavity and two apertures, then both gates open. Only then does metal return to nature, and one may be called *returned elixir*. Thus it is said: “the qi of metal also requires it,” and so on. *Requires* means it requires this method of absorption.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Root-Foundation of the Mysterious Female**\n\nThose who cultivate the Mysterious must, whether refining the Great Elixir or the Lesser Elixir, quietly nurture the Valley Spirit to establish their root-foundation. The Valley Spirit is the name for the primordial, empty, and numinous—it is our original nature. Where is it nurtured? In the Mysterious Female.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: “The Mysterious Female consists of two things. Without these two, how could the myriad things come to be?” For *xuan* (玄) is Heaven, and *pin* (牝) is Earth—this is already evident in the first hexagram of the *Book of Changes*. Thus, the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is truly the source of all generation and transformation. How could one who enters the Dao fail to seek this source of generation and transformation? This source of generation and transformation is precisely the aperture of the Mysterious Female.\n\nSome cite the words of Lord Lao: “The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.” But why do they also take the Valley Spirit to be the Mysterious Transformation? The answer is: by borrowing the Mysterious Female of emptiness and nothingness to nurture the Valley Spirit of emptiness and nothingness, they thus name the Mysterious Female after the Valley Spirit. This is the meaning of naming according to function.\n\nMoreover, there is further explanation: *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun. It is called the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, within which lies the essence of Kan and Li.” Thus, the Mysterious Female not only nurtures spirit but also nurtures qi. Now, when spirit and qi merge, the Mysterious Female appears. Therefore, one must concentrate spirit and gather qi, allowing the two to intermingle, only then can the circle of Qian and Kun be formed. Within this lies the function of inversion. Why? That which congeals from above downward is spirit. As the noble body of Mysterious Heaven performs the humble bow of Earthly Female, above and below intermingle harmoniously, and qi and spirit unite.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: “The union of all under Heaven is the Female of all under Heaven.” For this aperture lies at the center, hence it is called the union of all under Heaven; within it lies the Way of softness, hence it is called the Female of all under Heaven. When speaking of the Female Way, the Mysterious Way is also implied, thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is one Qian and one Kun, one firm and one yielding. Without this, spirit would be strong and qi would be strong, opposing and separating from each other. Therefore, it is said: the male descends to the female, spirit descends to qi, inverting and uniting, yin and yang mating. Only then do spirit and qi meet, and the root-foundation is established. Otherwise, spirit remains spirit and qi remains qi, qi remains qi and spirit remains spirit. If spirit does not obtain qi, there is nothing to supplement spirit. If qi does not return to spirit, there is no function to nurture spirit. How could one hope for the original spirit to abide long?\n\nMoreover, if spirit dwells in the Crimson Palace, the Crimson Palace becomes the bright hall of governance, and all knowledge, perceptions, and disturbances will disturb it. Only by congealing it in the Yellow Court can sounds and thoughts cease—this, too, is not without its quiet nurturing. Thus, *Awakening to Reality* says: “To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root-foundation. When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”\n\nThe Valley Spirit is the most empty and numinous mercury-nature. True essence is the purest and most tender lead-emotion. The root-foundation is the place where mercury welcomes lead to forge the Golden Elixir. The Golden Chamber is the Yellow Room. As it is the place where gold returns, it is called the Golden Chamber. When metal-lead and wood-mercury merge, only then is a luminous pearl formed. The luminous pearl is a grain of Golden Elixir, as large as a millet seed. When metal returns to nature at the outset, it may be called the Returned Elixir. Once obtained, it is eternally possessed, hence it is said to “never depart.”\n\nI have often said that this poem by Ziyang directly reveals the true formula of the ages, applicable to both the precelestial and postcelestial. What I have explained pertains to the precelestial. Even from the postcelestial perspective, one must first seek the Mysterious Female to lay the foundation of the Elixir. For the Valley Spirit relies on it to stand, and true essence also relies on it to return. Nurture the Valley Spirit with the Mysterious Female, and nurture true essence with the Valley Spirit. Spirit is cultivated by essence to strengthen the original, and essence is transformed by spirit into qi.\n\nThe *Triple Concordance* says: “Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in stillness and emptiness.” It also says: “The nature-master resides within, establishing the barriers.” From this, we know that the essential task of cultivating the body is to first nurture the Valley Spirit in stillness as the root-foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Direct Indication of the \"Center\"**\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: “Much speech hastens exhaustion; it is better to guard the center.” To recognize this center is to possess the seed of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Otherwise, there is no ground for cultivating the Dao, and with every step, one falls into the demonic pit.\n\nWhat is this center? It is the Mysterious Pass. The *Triple Concordance* says: “In movement, do not lose the center,” and “Float and wander, guarding the compass of the center.” Both refer to this.\n\nImmortal Tao said: “The center is not the middle among the four directions or above and below. The Confucians speak of the center as the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise; the Daoists speak of the unmoving thought as the Mysterious Female; the Buddhists speak of neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil, and in that very moment, ask: ‘What is the original face?’—this is the true center.”\n\nThe wondrous state of the center naturally nurtures the self, congeals spirit, enters the chamber to return the Elixir, and even transcends the womb to achieve spirit-transformation—all depend on this. Therefore, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this center to have a path of ascent.\n\nIn ancient times, Celestial Master Wen Shi asked the Most High: “What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the body?” The Most High replied: “It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the center and embracing the One.”\n\nLet me now attempt to expound on these words. At the outset of practice, the learner must firmly hold the sinews and bones, fiercely battle the sleep demon, seal the senses and lower the curtains, detach from all delusive thoughts, and turn the light inward to illuminate the three cavities. These three cavities are the Yellow Court, the Sea of Qi, and the Cinnabar Field.\n\nYet though one turns the light inward to illuminate the three cavities, one must neither fix the mind upon them nor let it wander among them. Only then does spirit settle within, breath follow its natural course, and all distinctions dissolve into utter oblivion, leaving no trace or sign. This is precisely what the *Classic* means by “desireless, observe its mystery.”\n\nAt the moment of perfect emptiness and quiescent guarding, when spirit congeals and qi unites, an unexpected realm may suddenly emerge from the compass of awareness—boundless without, infinitesimal within—whereupon the Mysterious Pass appears. This is what the *Classic* means by “desiring, observe its aperture.”\n\nFurther examining the *Contract*, it states: “Closing above is called *having*; closing below is called *not-having*.” I submit that these “above” and “below” both lie concealed within the character *center*. Yin and yang course within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between them, merging above and below into its midst. Thus, when the upper is closed and the lower sealed, the mechanism remains subtly secure. Within the Great Void, the primordial qi moves alone—hence *not-having*, which is also the purport of observing mystery. When the lower is closed and the upper sealed, the hidden remains unseen. Yet within the profound obscurity, essence abides, and within it, a sign exists—hence *having* and *desiring*, all residing in the subtleties of the Mysterious. Therefore, the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass is variously called the aperture of having and not-having, the upper and lower crucibles, the cauldron of yin and yang, or the cavity of spirit and qi. All derive from this, and all are subsumed within the One Center.\n\nThe Master commented: “To study the Dao, study the Dao—first one must grasp its mystery. Without grasping its mystery, one cannot glimpse its aperture. To glimpse its aperture, one must hear the Dao.” I and Tuanyang shared a knowing smile.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: A Direct Explanation of Medicinal Substances**\nWhat are medicinal substances? Shangyang said: “This medicine arises from within things.” Medicines are of two kinds: lesser medicine and greater medicine, corresponding to the Dao’s division into prior-heaven and posterior-heaven. Posterior-heaven medicine is lesser medicine, used for forming the elixir. Prior-heaven medicine is greater medicine, used for returning the elixir. Posterior-heaven medicine is formless and without substance yet truly exists; prior-heaven medicine has form and function yet is truly non-existent.\n\nPosterior-heaven true lead discards *gui* and selects *ren*, concealing yang within yin to generate being from non-being. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “How could the three primals and eight trigrams depart from *ren*?” The three primals are the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. *Ren* is born of Heaven’s One, residing before *zi*, the origin of the first yang. Both *ren* and *gui* dwell in the northern Kan, where water pertains to yin. *Ren*-water is yang within yin; *gui*-water is yin within yin. Moreover, *ren* and *gui* are stems, while *hai* and *zi* are branches. To seek true lead, one must take the heavenly stems as primary and the earthly branches as secondary, for heaven precedes earth.\n\nIn essence, *ren* signifies only the primal meaning—the beginning without thought or deliberation, the moment before movement returns to stillness. *Zi*, by contrast, is the time of knowing and awareness, the threshold between stillness and movement. *Gui*-yin is not used, and *hai*, not yet free of yin, is also not used. This is the method for seeking lesser medicine.\n\nPrior-heaven medicine is otherwise: it is produced in Kun and sown in Qian, generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. When Qian-metal enters Kun, it is called “metal within Kun.” Kun truly becomes Kan, called “metal within water.” Kan resides in the north, while Dui in the west is its neighbor, so it may be said to lodge in Dui. It is not sought in Qian, for Qian is the place of sowing. It is not sought in Kun, for Kun is the place of containing the primordial. It is not sought in Kan, for though Kan contains yang, it remains hidden within water, its qi-mechanism not yet revealed. It is sought directly in Dui, where lead produces yang and the metal manifests—like the moon’s third day, emerging from the *geng* direction.\n\nThus, Kan-water is the river’s source, and Dui-metal is the medicinal substance. It is not that Qian, Kun, Kan, and Dui are arrayed within the body; rather, all is a matter of generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. I move a single drop of yin-fire’s essence, sowing it within the other’s household, thereby generating yang within lead. When yang-qi stirs, it is gathered and returned, then sown within my own womb-palace to form the true person. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “Relying on Kun’s position, the body is formed; sown in Qian’s household, the palace of mutual resonance.” The sowing in Qian is the initial planting; the sowing in Qian’s household is nurturing. If Cui and Zhang were to rise again, they would surely affirm this humble interpretation.\n\nThe mechanism of sowing lead to obtain lead is thus. Yet the method of sowing lead must lie between the sequence of *ding* and *ren*, then the effects of Zhen and Dui may take their turn. My teacher’s oral instructions are all contained herein. The true mechanism of inner and outer medicines is now laid bare. Those who grasp these words are thrice blessed—do not treat them lightly.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Discerning Lead and Mercury**\nThe spirit within the heart is called mercury-nature; the essence within the heart is called mercury-fluid. Gathering mercury-nature in the Yellow Court and congealing mercury-fluid in the Purple Palace produces dragon-mercury, which is true mercury, the inner elixir, the yin elixir, and the posterior-heaven half-catty.\n\nThe qi within the body is called lead-essence; the essence within the body is called lead-flower. Observing lead-essence in the Kan Palace and gathering lead-flower at the Dui Gate produces tiger-lead, which is true lead, the outer elixir, the yang elixir, and the prior-heaven eight-ounce mother.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: A Direct Explanation of the Crucible**\nIn the elixir method, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Taking from Kan to fill Li, metal first returns. Kun’s form has six segments, its body fundamentally empty.\n\nAt the extreme of earth’s yin configuration, one yang returns to restore. Qian’s form has three continuous lines, its body entirely solid. Within heaven’s flourishing yang configuration, one yin suddenly arises. Between heaven and earth, the solid cannot contain things, while the empty can receive. Thus, one borrows Kun’s emptiness to conceal its solidity and first casts Qian’s solid into its emptiness. The method’s workings are thus, yet one must also understand the transference of metal to distinguish the maturity of the medicine. From the prior-heaven Qian-metal concealed within Kun’s position, at this moment yin contains yang. Though it resembles the one within Kan, the form lies hidden beneath water, secret and unrevealed. Only when metal appears within water—like the moon rising in the west at Dui—does it become usable metal. Harvested in the span of one talisman, this is precisely the time of having qi without substance. Taking from Dui is like taking from Kan; producing from Dui is like producing from Kun. Yet without the radiance of Qian-father’s essence, this great medicine cannot be produced. Though it serves as host, I become the guest. While it seeks to ascend, I descend instead. Guest and host rise and sink, all operating within the crucible. Only then does one realize the crucible’s design lies in its emptiness.\n\nMaster Tao says: “Within the crucible, originally there is nothing. After the two-sevens’ period, moved by Qian-father’s radiant essence, yang qi first stirs. Within the Qian crucible, originally there is also nothing. At the time of harvesting, receiving Kun-mother’s yang-lead, the golden elixir begins to congeal. All is created ex nihilo. The term ‘crucible’ merely borrows this as a vessel to hold things.” His words are most profound, hence recorded here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan**\nPrior-heaven is Qian and Kun; posterior-heaven is Kan and Li. Yet prior-heaven has Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li. Posterior-heaven has Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun. What is the reason? Prior-heaven as Qian and Kun means primordial yang remains unbroken in youthful purity, internally possessing Qian’s image with yang firmly established, externally possessing Kun’s image with yin firmly established—hence called prior-heaven Qian and Kun. Posterior-heaven as Kan and Li means that in middle age, primordial yang has departed, Kun envelops Qian’s yang to form Kan, and Qian envelops Kun’s yin to form Li—hence called posterior-heaven Kan and Li. Prior-heaven having Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li means using Qian and Kun as the crucible and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Posterior-heaven having Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun means employing Kan and Li in subtle work to restore Qian and Kun’s original body.\n\nThere is more to know: the substance refined in posterior-heaven’s self-cultivation is called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to taking from Kan to fill Li to form the Jade-Fluid Returned Elixir. The substance refined in prior-heaven’s return to the origin is also called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to transforming Kan into Li to produce the Golden-Fluid Returned Elixir. Both prior-heaven and posterior-heaven’s taking from Kan are called prior-heaven, differing only in whether the medicine comes from another or is planted in one’s own field.\n\nIn my humble opinion: prior-heaven Qian and Kun are the celestial medicine, just as posterior-heaven Kan and Li are the human medicine. A youth who receives the method and meets a teacher sits guarding Qian and Kun to attain the Dao. Once fallen into posterior-heaven, Qian and Kun are renamed the crucible.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Subtle Work of Harvesting and Refining**\nHarvesting and refining means gathering the other’s yang-lead and refining the qi of one’s own child-pearl. Yang-lead is earth’s po, for it is concealed within the extreme yin outside, hence called earth’s po. When obtained during self-refinement, it can control one’s mercury-nature and transform it into cinnabar. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Simply use earth’s po to capture mercury-sand”—one need only know how to harvest and refine.\n\nWhat is harvesting? Harvesting with non-harvesting. What is refining? Refining with non-refining.\n\nWhat is non-harvesting harvesting? Dragon at ease, tiger at rest, guarding the feminine without masculinity. In the month of the winter solstice, its qi begins to rise. The spirit immediately follows its ascent, reversing into the crucible, drawing it in—this is non-harvesting harvesting.\n\nWhat is non-refining refining? When it is in my home, the medicine itself is fire. After prolonged fusion, its yin naturally transforms. Yang then grows accordingly, accumulating in the furnace and naturally circulating—hence called non-refining refining.\n\nYet one must concentrate the spirit to await it, then harvest it. Regulate the breath to guard it, then refine it. When essence is entirely transformed into qi, the abdomen becomes full, and the inner elixir can be formed.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The River Chariot’s Subtle Essentials**\nThe River Chariot is the essential method of moving the medicine after obtaining it, not the method of imagined transference. It is the fire-timing of advancing and retreating at midnight and noon, the closing of yin and yang, the ascending and descending of internal and external, the natural fire of heaven and earth. From the foundation-building stage onward, after the golden crucible is full, regulate the inner breath and concentrate the inner spirit. When spirit and breath depend on each other, wind and fire merge. Suddenly, the spiritual sprout sprouts, and the qi-mechanism stirs. I then activate the River Chariot to refine it, causing it to move from below to the rear, entering through the Governing Vessel, flowing backward to the Celestial Valley, and returning to the Central Palace—this is the proper procedure after obtaining the medicine.\n\nAlas, later generations lacking true transmission often fall into imagined transference, moving emptily back and forth—what benefit is there? Only because few attain subtle realization do immortals’ teachers find it difficult to explain. Now I shall attempt to clarify: its subtlety lies in intent guarding within and spirit driving without. Yet since this explanation exists, skeptics abound.\n\nThe reason is that the true spirit is the true intent—how can they be divided in two places? Presiding within while also presiding without, how can one fulfill two roles alone? This doubt is inevitable. Yet one must know that when the spirit guards the inner court, it values concentration, not movement. Movement necessarily employs intent.\n\nThe marvel of the celestial cycle lies in its external movement being effortless while its internal governance is laborious—thus the internal governance must be borne by intent. It is like a person sitting before a lamp: the shadow appears on the wall, and as the body moves, the shadow moves with it. Speech arises within the room, and sound flows beyond the walls—words uttered, sound follows. Intent is like the body and speech of the spirit; the spirit is like the shadow and echo of intent. There has never been a case where they do not see or hear each other. Therefore, when intent calculates within, the spirit naturally moves without—though two, they remain one. Moving within is moving without; one need not attend to it, for they naturally know each other.\n\nWhy is this so? True intent resides at the center, directing breath to respond within and without—this is inherently knowing the internal. Yet as true intent flows, piercing barriers and crossing the crown, there is a subtle mutual awareness. Is this the spirit? Is this intent? Does this spirit return to this intent? Master Wu said: \"There is a subtle intent of mutual knowing\"—this is precisely it. I do not know how spirit and intent transform their forms or divide their presence, nor how they coordinate within and without. To claim ignorance is true knowledge.\n\nI simply submit to my intent and regulate my inner self: here, qi stirs; there, qi ascends. Here, wind moves; there, wind carries. Here is intent; there is spirit. Spirit and intent—divided yet undivided. One feels that the guardian within manages household affairs, while the driver without ascends to the heavenly gate, yet knows not how this subtle intent of mutual awareness arises.\n\nProfound, oh profound! Riding the immortal raft, drifting on the Silver River, paying court to the azure vault, returning to the Yellow Court—mechanism smooth, spirit flowing, bliss unbounded. Day after day in circulation, morning after morning in passage, qi surges through the hundred joints, infusing the three palaces. Only then does the obtained medicine avoid idleness and waste, and true qi grow ever more abundant.\n\nAlas! The world’s people, oblivious to the river chariot’s essence, toil in vain with laborious transference, exhausting their minds.\n\nShould the true transmission not be expounded in detail,\nNo matter where you seek, your search shall be in vain.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: On the True Heart**\n\nThe Dao of the Golden Elixir values the attainment of true spirit, true qi, and true essence, for only then can the work of creation be accomplished. Yet without employing the true heart, one cannot obtain this true essence, true qi, or true spirit.\n\nThe true heart resides in the moment before discriminating thoughts arise, before human desires intermingle, before the sprouts of yin qi are tainted. The wondrous Dao of cultivating the body begins with settling into stillness. For the student whose refinement of the self remains impure, only this practice can yield results. It is what strategists call striking when the enemy least expects, attacking when they are unprepared.\n\nWhen the mind-ground momentarily clears, I seal the Three Treasures, concentrate the spirit, and regulate the breath. Inner thoughts do not stray outward; outer thoughts do not intrude. At this time, before desires arise, effort yields immediate effect. Seizing the moment before the spirit of consciousness is employed, one may perceive the true spirit. Seizing the moment before turbid qi stirs, one may nurture the true qi. Seizing the moment before lustful essence scatters, one may await the true essence.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, one attains utmost emptiness and abides in profound stillness, thereby recognizing the mysterious pass. This is the foremost principle of dual cultivation of nature and life. How wondrous is the function of the true heart!\n\nIf, however, one waits until affairs, interactions, laughter, speech, or eating stir the mind’s mechanism before attempting to restrain it, the inner heart will already be stirred, and杂念 will have arisen. If I suppress them and they cease, it is fortunate. But should they cease only to rise again, or be driven away only to return—each attempt to expel them only multiplying their number—then one faces a formidable foe. Closing the eyes, one wages war between heaven and humanity; touching the heart, one finds a field of ruin. The heart is defeated. What then can be done?\n\nGenerally, beginners cannot compare to those long detached from worldly ties, who forget emotions when facing circumstances. Those who suddenly awaken to emptiness are indeed of superior wisdom, while those who gradually awaken to their nature are not of inferior rank. The student need only seek the true heart as the starting point. Though their refinement of the self may be incomplete, they may still enter the gate of stillness, provided they grasp the true heart whenever it appears.\n\nThis true heart may arise at dawn, at dusk, or at any hour within the twelve. One must recognize and seize it for oneself. Though this teaching may seem novel, it is not truly so. Moreover, it benefits beginners and harmonizes with the ancient alchemical classics without contradiction.\n\nIf one gradually cultivates thus—guarding the true at all times, embracing the true each day, never failing to perceive it—then through gradual progress one attains constancy. Over time, purity and stillness become complete, and the work of refining the self is naturally encompassed. Is this not grand?\n\nThus, when the mind-ground is momentarily clear, it is a precious opportunity for practice, a golden moment, a wondrous state. May one treasure it as if a single instant were worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Direct Exposition on the Heart and Spirit**\n*(Including the Method of Breath Regulation)*\n\nThe heart is the master of the entire body; the spirit is the supreme medicine of the three grades. One must discern whether heart and spirit are two or one.\n\nLaozi said: \"The human spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it. The human heart delights in stillness, but desires drag it away. Thus, constantly dispelling desires, the heart becomes still of itself. Clarifying the heart, the spirit becomes clear of itself.\"\n\nLu Qianxu said: \"The method of regulating the breath begins with regulating the heart. The method of concentrating the spirit begins with regulating the breath.\" This is the bridge of sages, immortals, and buddhas, the path by which we enter virtue.\n\nThose who begin to study the Dao must gather their thoughts and return to stillness. In movement and rest, sitting and lying down, all must reside within the cavity of the chest, for only then can the guarding of stillness be steadfast.\n\nFor the mind with thoughts is the deluded heart; the mind without thoughts is the true heart. If one can collect their thoughts in daily life and return them to their proper place, they can focus their mind in the moment and solidify the foundation of entering samadhi. As the sages said: \"Knowing where to stop, one attains stability; with stability, one attains stillness.\"\n\nWhen the heart is still, the breath is easily regulated. The subtler the heart, the more refined the breath. When the breath is regulated, the spirit returns. Thereupon, one further stabilizes the spirit, concentrating it within the qi cavity.\n\nThe heart, then, is also called spirit. Why? The heart resides in the Crimson Palace. When stirred, it becomes thoughts; when stilled, it returns to being the heart. Returning the still heart to the chamber of spirit, it becomes spirit. Spirit is without thought, without worry, without action—yet within non-action, all actions are possible; within non-use, great use is concealed. This is the supreme medicine of the three grades.\n\nWhen concentrating the spirit, one must ensure it remains dependent on the breath. Do not let the spirit chase the breath, nor let it manipulate the breath. Chasing the breath scatters the spirit; manipulating the breath agitates it. Simply allow the breath to move naturally, following its own rhythm. Thus, the spirit becomes ever more concentrated.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the spirit has grasped the mechanism of qi. The qi first breaks through primordial chaos—motionless, yet responsive and interconnected. Is this not the active practice of the Daoist cultivator?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Wondrous Function of Spirit and Breath**\n\nSpirit is fire; breath is wind. To comprehend the mysterious mechanism of wind and fire, one must properly settle spirit and breath.\n\nThe spirit should be inwardly luminous yet silent; the breath should rely on true qi, flowing continuously. Simply stabilize the spirit without chasing the breath. It is like gathering fire in a furnace while drawing wind through bellows. The wind fans the flames, making them burn brighter, and the metal naturally melts. Thus, the wind comes to assist the fire—it is not the fire pursuing the wind.\n\nYet within this lies a subtle mechanism: to ensure the bellows’ qi blows with focused intensity, the wind pipe must press close to the furnace, allowing it to pass through the regulator. Only then can it fan the furnace’s flames, deepening their azure hue.\n\nWhen the practitioner gathers spirit and collects qi, it is like fire melting metal. When the breath blows into the Kan (Water) trigram, it is like guiding the pipe close to the furnace, creating the momentum of wind aiding fire. As the furnace’s fire blazes, yang radiance surges. At this moment, spirit is qi, and qi is the elixir—just as fire forges iron red-hot, and red-hot iron is itself fire. This is what Qiongguan Weng meant by “fire is the elixir, the elixir is fire.” When fire and elixir merge, the Golden Elixir is instantly formed. If the breath does not blow inward but merely plays at the throat and nose, it is like the pipe not pressing close to the furnace. Is this not laughable?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Further Discussion on Spirit and Breath**\n\nWhen the breath is still, the spirit returns. The method of gathering spirit relies on regulating the breath. When the spirit is settled, the breath rests. The method of regulating the breath also relies on gathering the spirit. For when spirit is preserved in emptiness, the internal breath truly exists. Thus, the breath lingers because of the spirit, and the spirit remains because of the breath. Spirit and breath are balanced, neither fully present nor absent—one does not know whether spirit is breath or breath is spirit. Wind fans the fire, and fire burns with the wind. They sustain and intertwine, so that one does not know whether wind is fire or fire is wind. When the practice is fully refined, there is truly something beyond description in words.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Wondrous Use of Qi and Breath**\n\nCao Yuanjun said: “I tell you all the truth: the root of life has always resided in the true breath.” Why is the true breath the root of life? Because the postnatal breath harmonizes with the prenatal breath, and the prenatal breath is the true qi within the body, stirred by the breath into gentle ebb and flow. At this time, is it the breath moving? Or is it the qi moving? When the breath moves, the qi moves as well—neither is distinct. The breath contains qi, hence it is called the “misty true breath.” The qi contains breath, hence it is called the “bellows of true breath.” When the true breath moves, true qi is born; when true qi arrives, the root of life is born. The root of returning to life, the source of nurturing life, the treasure of protecting life—all truly lie in the true breath.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Wondrous Use of Spirit and Intention**\n\nSpirit values concentration, as the *Cantong Qi* says: “Abide in tranquility and emptiness, inwardly illuminating the body.” Spirit is not intention, as it is said: “To inwardly illuminate the Mysterious Pass, one must employ true intention.” I have heard Chongxu say: “True intention is the right awakening within emptiness.” Qianxu said: “To infuse above and below, the primordial spirit must operate within.” The primordial spirit’s operation is the primordial spirit’s right awakening. One cannot say that the primordial spirit is true intention—they differ in substance and function. For in profound stillness and non-action, the spirit governs and moves in quietude. In composed elegance, intention manages affairs without confusion. Thus, spirit is the lord of the elixir, and intention is its emissary. Spirit and intention truly differ in substance and function. Since they differ in substance and function, they are two. Yet because function arises from substance, they may also be regarded as one. However, there is a further point: to cultivate true intention, one must nurture primordial qi. True intention arises from extreme stillness, thereby perfecting one’s wondrous use. This is what the Dao calls “constantly responding, constantly still,” what the Confucians call “being at ease before contemplation,” and what the Buddhists call “wisdom arising from samadhi.”\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Further Discussion on Spirit and Intention**\n\nAt the beginning of sitting with lowered eyelids, spirit and intention need not be distinguished. But when movement and stillness alternate, then spirit and intention part ways. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with spirit, and it will not do to substitute intention. This applies when attaining emptiness, preserving stillness, and observing return—such as at the moment of tending the furnace. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with intention, and it will not do to lead with spirit. This applies when capturing lead, restraining mercury, and wielding the Celestial Stem—such as during the alchemical union. Why? Spirit is non-action, while intention is action. Spirit is non-action yet all-accomplishing; intention is action with purpose. Spirit is the spirit of intention, and intention takes spirit as its true origin—spirit governs stillness. Intention is the intention of spirit, and spirit takes intention as its right awakening—intention enables movement. To nurture primordial spirit, one must take “no thought” as the foundation, thereby achieving non-action and all-accomplishment. Shangyang’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* says: “The true person lurks in the deep abyss, responding with no thought. Floating and wandering within the compass, employing with no thought. Breathing in harmony, achieving with no thought. The three natures unite, entering with no thought.” The use of no thought is not limited to this. To activate true intention, one must first refine the self, thereby achieving action and purposeful action. Qianxu’s *Jiuzheng Pian* says: “Refine the self to seek lead, welcoming it with the self. Draw fire into the crucible, sending it with the self. Smelt and bathe, guarding it with the self. Warm and nurture, completing it with the self.” The wondrousness of the self’s earth is also not limited to this. Ah, spirit! Ah, intention! They run through the entire process of Golden Elixir cultivation, never to be parted for even a moment. There are other wondrous uses, but they all depend on the practitioner’s own inquiry. I have merely compiled these teachings to open the way.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Debate on Attaining Immortality**\n\nThe ancients said: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, and the next establish teachings—all three are immortal.” To preserve the immortal spirit is the Dao. The three are also immortal because they assist the Dao. Benevolent virtue is the substance of the Dao, and humble virtue is its function. Universal salvation is the substance of the Dao, and self-cultivation is its function. As for teachings, they are the record of merit and virtue, the writings that convey the Dao.\n\nThus do they contend together for immortality.\n\nNow, what decays is common, and what does not decay is sagely. That by which one may contend for immortality lies in having nothing to contend for, yet also in having something to contend for. Having nothing to contend for, one places oneself last and paradoxically becomes first; one softens one’s resolve and yet overcomes the rigid. Having something to contend for, one displays the beard and brows of a man, the backbone of a true hero, the boldness of a champion, and the ferocity of a great soul. Not contending with others for a fleeting moment, one contends with them for all eternity.\n\nConfucius said: “When it comes to benevolence, one does not yield even to one’s teacher.” The teacher fears precisely that the disciple may fail to contend—merely collapsing into cowardice. A former Confucian master said: “The qi of dawn’s clarity and the spirit of the still night differ not at all from those of the sages. If one can expand upon this, even Confucius and Yan Hui would not surpass them.” The Śākya tradition states: “In the stillness of able benevolence, how does one differ from Śākyamuni? In the profound practice of prajñā, how is one distinct from freedom itself?” Daoist texts say: “Did Gautama arise from the earth? Did Zhong and Lü descend from heaven?” All these contend for the Dao and do not necessarily yield to those who came before. Let the aspirant take heed!\n\nThe myriad truths and ten thousand sages fundamentally do not begrudge others contending for the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On Retiring After Success and Fame**\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: “To retire after success and fame is the Way of Heaven.” I hold that the Way of Heaven is also the Way of humanity, and likewise the Way of self-cultivation. Heaven’s success and fame lie in the flourishing of growth and fulfillment; as the seasons turn and beings are nurtured, the heavenly Dao retreats and withdraws, concealing itself in winter’s reign. Such is the Way of Heaven. For humans, success and fame lie in utmost loyalty; having achieved merit, one retires with courage, and having attained fame, one conceals oneself—thus do heroes follow the example of Master Red Pine. Or, success and fame may lie in perfect filial piety: the mutual nourishment of will and body is the merit, and the universal praise of the clan is the fame. When parents reach a hundred years, the filial child’s duty is complete; one retires to preserve life—such is the Way of humanity. For the alchemist, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness is merit without merit; the profound and indistinct is fame without fame. When the return is accomplished, the sacred embryo is formed, and fame is attained, one retires to the ancestral aperture, embracing the One and returning to emptiness—such is the Way of elixir cultivation. Those who comprehend this should reflect on its resonance with virtue and human nature.\n\n**Chapter Forty: On the Unity of Immortal and Buddha Cultivation**\n\nThe dual cultivation of nature and life is the essential principle for becoming an immortal, attaining buddhahood, or achieving sagehood. Some claim that Buddhists cultivate nature, Daoists cultivate life, and Confucians govern the world, each with distinct paths—yet this stems from a shallow understanding of their fundamental principles.\n\nIn my view: Buddhism emphasizes nature, yet within it lies a special transmission beyond the teachings. It is not that life is absent, but rather that it is spoken of in secret. The emphasis on nature is intended to enable one to establish life through nature, expanding the capacity of nature to illuminate the ten directions without boundary. Daoism emphasizes life, yet within it lies a true transmission within the teachings. It is not that nature is unmentioned, but rather that it is discussed sparingly. The emphasis on life is intended to enable one to comprehend nature through life, securing the root of life to endure through ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nIf the cultivation of nature is perfected yet the external cultivation of life is neglected, true nature will be difficult to preserve, ultimately remaining in empty stillness—how then can one encompass the realms of sand and dust? If the cultivation of life is thorough yet the internal cultivation of nature is incomplete, true life may be preserved, but only the physical body is maintained—how then can one attain spiritual penetration of the three realms?\n\nOnly Buddhism possesses a special transmission beyond the teachings, enabling one to establish life through nature, so that the Land of Ultimate Bliss becomes ever more luminous and empty. Only Daoism possesses a true transmission within the teachings, enabling one to comprehend nature through life, so that the Heaven of Great Purity becomes ever more transcendent. Thus, immortals, buddhas, and sages—all engage in dual cultivation, not single cultivation.\n\nWhen Śākyamuni entered deep meditation, his crown was pierced and his knees were transfixed. When Mahākāśyapa expounded the true meaning, he caused the flagpole of the monastery to topple. What do you make of this?\n\nMaster Lü said: “To cultivate nature alone without cultivating life is the foremost illness in spiritual practice.” Master Ziyang said: “Even if you fully awaken to the true suchness of nature, you will still have to discard one body only to enter another. How much better to cultivate the great medicine as well, and swiftly transcend the leaky to become a true person.” These examples may be taken as one corner from which the rest may be inferred.\n\nWhen prajñā is practiced profoundly, the five aggregates are all empty. When the elixir matures and the great return is achieved, one faces the wall for ten years. At sixty, the ears are attuned; at seventy, the heart follows its desires. Only then are nature and life both perfected, ascending together to the realm of emptiness and transcendence—thus do immortals, buddhas, and sages all attain fulfillment.\n\nThe *Song of Enlightenment* by the First Patriarch Bodhidharma states:\n*“The three teachings share one method,\nDo not regard them as two.\nNature and life must be cultivated together,\nSo that heaven and earth do not decay.”*\n\nWhy, then, must one engage in disputes?\n\nMoreover, there is this further point: the transmission of the three teachings remains unknown to their followers. If they understood this, they would not contradict one another. Each should simply fulfill its own Way and return to the Dao.\n\nNow, suppose there were a master of the great Dao who addressed the three teachings, saying: “The three teachings are the three pillars of my Way. Though divided into three, they are united as one. The Dao cannot be divided, for then it would lack transformation; the Dao cannot be united, for then it would lack a governing principle. Thus, the three pillars establish its ultimate expression.\n\nThe Buddhist and Daoist teachings speak of nature while silently transmitting life; the Daoist and immortal teachings transmit life while silently transmitting nature. The Confucian teaching takes the bearing of worldly responsibilities as its urgent task. Nature is rarely spoken of, life is even more seldom mentioned, and both nature and life are cultivated in silence. As a result, the descendants of the three traditions, each adhering to their ancestral lineage, have become specialized schools. They stir the heavens and shake the earth, debating right and wrong, opening boundless realms of contention. When Buddhists attack Daoism, they employ marvelous strategies of overturning emptiness. When Daoists attack Buddhism, they employ divine insights of pointing directly to reality.”\n\nWhen Confucians attack Buddhism and Daoism, they produce inexhaustible essays and endless sophistry. Yet how could they know that all these are but branches of the Dao? Since the Dao divides into three, how could there be no divergence in its offshoots, no distinction between the heterodox and the orthodox? Why, then, do they not contemplate the root but instead debate the branches?\n\nTo regard nature as encompassing life is one current; to regard life as encompassing nature is another; to merge nature and life into one is yet another. These three currents are all currents of the Dao. In their return to the non-being, they are one.\n\nA gāthā says:\nBlowing out the bright lamp to play games,\nWho knows they strike their own kin?\nIf I speak of those who attack one another,\nIt is but scattered blossoms dusting your body.\n\n*Volume Two: Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles*\nBy Changyi Mountain Man Li Hanxu\nCollated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian\n\n**Reader’s Guide to *Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles***\n\n1. The author of this book, Li Hanxu, is commonly known as the Western School. Though its main principles do not exceed the scope of the *Triple Unification* and *Awakening to Reality*, having formed its own school, it must possess distinctive features not found in other alchemical classics. Scholars should discern these differences.\n\n2. As practitioners’ efforts progress in stages and their levels vary in depth, the text introduces the theory of the three \"river chariots.\" The first river chariot refers to the first stage of practice, the second to the second stage, and the third to the third stage. However, the path of circulating the river chariot remains singular, without divergence. Do not mistakenly assume there are three separate paths.\n\n3. In the sections on the three river chariots, there may be instances of excessive description or inappropriate analogies. Readers should not cling to the literal meaning or force interpretations.\n\n4. The *Mind-Collecting Method* in the appendix is particularly essential. If one studies it carefully, one will surely benefit.\n\n5. The *Daoist Songs, Poems, and Miscellaneous Writings* also contain subtle meanings. If readers can draw connections and extend understanding, it would be most excellent.\n\n6. This book is an old manuscript, transmitted for over eighty years without ever being printed. Aside from the three chapters on the river chariots, other sections—such as the *Mind-Collecting Method* and *Daoist Songs*—were not originally titled separately nor properly attributed under the *Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles*. Their arrangement was also disordered. Here, two appendices are newly designated, and the text has been reorganized for the reader’s convenience.\n\n7. Previous alchemical works were composed either to seek external protection or to instruct disciples, not for universal salvation or posterity. Thus, they need not be comprehensible to all, and in fact, precautions were taken to prevent universal understanding. Hence, cryptic terms and obscure names abound, leaving readers bewildered, unsure of their meaning. Often, the intended meaning is concealed, and the truth is obscured. This is why no Daoist practitioner fails to lament the difficulty of reading alchemical classics.\n\n8. If the meaning of this book remains unclear, one should seek answers in *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*. If *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries* still eludes comprehension, one should consult the *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, as they can mutually illuminate one another.\n\nWritten in May of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) by Chen Yingning of Wanjian in Shanghai.\n\n**A Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu**\n\nThe Perfected One was a native of Changyishan in Lijiahe, Leshan County, Jiading Prefecture, Sichuan. Born on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month at the hour of *yin* in the *bingyin* year of the Jiaqing reign (1786), his mother dreamed, at the moment of his birth, of a Daoist priest entering her home cradling a golden book in his arms; upon waking, she found the Perfected One already born. He was the second of three brothers, with his elder and younger siblings both becoming Daoist priests. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, and in his youth, he entered the county academy as a scholar. Skilled in the zither and fond of poetry and wine, at the age of twenty-four, he encountered the Patriarch Lü but did not recognize him.\n\nLater, afflicted with a blood-wasting illness, he followed his mother’s command to convalesce in Emei County, where he met Master Zheng Pushan. Master Zheng, a man of the Kangxi era, was a senior disciple of the Perfected Sun, whose personal name was Jiaoluan. Sharing lodgings with him for treatment, the master said, “Minerals, plants, and herbs can only address symptoms. To cure the root, one must employ the wondrous medicine of one’s own body—only then can true solidity be achieved.” Upon hearing this, the Perfected One felt as though awakening from a dream and immediately bowed in reverence, taking refuge under the master. Zheng then transmitted oral instructions, urging, “A great kalpa is approaching; you must swiftly cultivate to save the world. Moreover, you will have a primordial master among the Perfected.”\n\nLater, on Mount Emei, he encountered the Patriarchs Lü and Zhang in a monastic hall. His original name was Yuanzhi, styled Pingquan. The Patriarch Lü changed it to Xiyue, styled Hanxu, with an alternate name Tuanyang, secretly imparting the original sound. After several years of secluded cultivation, he achieved the Golden Elixir. The Three Masters reappeared, exhorting him to hasten in writing books to save the world.\n\nIn obedience to the command of the Three Perfected Ones, he composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Old Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Rootless Tree*, collectively titled *Fifteen Daoist Discourses*, also known as *Essentials of Preserving the Body*. He edited and revised the Patriarch Lü’s chronicles, sacred traces, alchemical classics, and salvific texts, naming the collection *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain*. He compiled the complete works of the Patriarch Zhang, titling it *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*. His own writings, including *Ninefold Refinement of the Heart*, *Scripture of the End of Literature*, and *A Treatise on the Postcelestial*, were all published. Additionally, he authored *Inner Chapters of Rounded Peaks*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*, none of which were published.\n\nIn the first month of the *bingshen* year of the Xianfeng reign (1856), I visited his abode at Changyishan and beheld his compassionate countenance, which appeared no older than thirty. After taking leave, the master ascended on the eighth day of the fifth lunar month at the hour of *yin*, with an extraordinary fragrance filling the sky for seven days. On that same day at the hour of *mao*, his immortal form manifested at Ziliujing. Following his ascension, his miraculous traces were too numerous to recount in full.\n\nThe master had two sons: the elder pursued Confucian scholarship, while the younger tilled the land. His eldest brother had three sons, the eldest of whom, at eleven years old, was intelligent, kind, and filial—qualities the master often praised with admiration. Though his disciples were many, only Zhou Daochang of Jiangxi achieved the Great Elixir, while several others attained the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. My virtue being meager and my karmic affinity shallow, I served the master but briefly. Here, I have merely outlined what I personally witnessed.\n\nRespectfully recorded by his disciple Li Daoshan of Qiaoyang, Jianning County, Fujian.\n\nThe Three Chariots refer to three types of *heche* (River Chariots). The first is the circulation of *qi*, which is the *xiaozhoutian* (Small Celestial Cycle) of firing at *zi* and *wu*; the second is the circulation of essence, which is the *yuye heche* (Jade Fluid River Chariot) for warming and nourishing with water; the third is the simultaneous circulation of essence and *qi*, which is the *dazhoutian* (Great Celestial Cycle) of refining precelestial gold and mercury, the Sevenfold Returned Elixir, and the Ninefold Returned Great Elixir. These Three Chariots all rely on the true spirit and true intent to govern their course. If one can comprehend the secret principles of the Three Chariots, then essence, *qi*, and spirit—these three treasures—will be perfectly complete, and the Three Immortals of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity will be attained.\n\nThe first River Chariot, the practice of circulating *qi*, is for opening the passes and laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Its sequence begins with nurturing the true breath within emptiness. Collect the mind, regulate the breath, close the eyes, and preserve the spirit. Stillness upon stillness, purity upon purity. Let go of all things, forgetting the entire body. In utter chaos and profound obscurity, when the work reaches this point, it is like winter in the heavens, when the myriad things flourish and each returns to its root; like night in the sun’s course, when the water clock sinks deep and each quiets its heart. This is the time of no-knowledge, no-perception. Yet who knows that in this moment of no-knowledge and no-perception, the first yang revives—just as winter gives birth to spring, or night turns toward dawn? Suddenly, one is startled: though no smoke is present, it seems as if there is smoke; though no *qi* is present, it seems as if there is *qi*. From the lower *dantian*, it steams up to the heart’s palace, awakening one as if from a dream. This moment of initial awakening is called the *huo zishi* (Living Zi Hour). Swiftly activate the first River Chariot to gather and circulate it; delay, and this formless *qi* will transform into something tangible. This *qi* is called *renqian* (Watery Lead), the postnatal, or the yang fire—hence it is said, “At the *zi* hour, advance the yang fire.” What does advancing the yang fire mean? The practitioner must abruptly turn the newly awakened heart, shifting it past the lower Magpie Bridge to the position just before the Big Dipper. This is the true secret never to be transmitted lightly. Move it to the *weilu* (Coccyx Pass), guarding it without disorder. In an instant, the true *qi* warms gently, passing through the two apertures at the tip of the coccyx, penetrating the spine, ascending to the *yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), and drilling into the *niwan* (Mud Pill Palace). The ancient immortals said: *“Through the double passes of the spine to the crown gate—this is the most revered path in cultivation.”* This is what they referred to. Fools, not understanding the circulation of *qi*, immediately press the tongue to the upper palate to receive the sweet dew. Alas! How laughable and pitiable—all due to not having received proper instruction. Know that in the practice of circulating *qi*, one can only guide the *qi* into the throat. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Ingest the mysterious *qi* to attain longevity.”* Thus, this yang fire *qi* is purple-black in color and is called the *xuanqi* (Mysterious Qi). The method of ingestion requires oral instructions to send it into the *qi* pipe. Otherwise, if it enters the food throat, where can the foundation of the elixir be established? One must guide this yang *qi* down the *qi* throat to the *xuanying* (Mysterious Throat), where it transforms into the water of sweet dew. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *“The Mysterious Throat’s *qi* pipe receives the essence talisman.”* This is what it means. The *xuanying* is also called *xuanyong* (Mysterious Obstruction), for when a person’s *qi* reaches this point, it becomes obstructed. Common folk, ignorant of this mystery, expect the *qi* to transform into divine water upon reaching the *niwan*, swallowing it like tea. I fear that even a single drop entering the *qi* pipe would cause unceasing coughing. How could water, a tangible substance, enter the *qi* pipe? Thus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Exhaling the clear and inhaling the mysterious, the two *qi* shine—if you encounter this, you will ascend to the Milky Way.”* This means the clear *qi* emerges from the *dantian*, while the mysterious *qi* enters the *xuanying*, the two *qi* transforming into one another. When the *qi* transforms into water, it showers the heart’s palace and returns to the Void Cavity. Treasure and nurture it—this is the foundation-laying. After laying the foundation for a long time, the accumulation deepens, and there comes a moment when, while sitting in stillness as usual, something suddenly emerges from the *dantian* with a sound like thunder and a radiance like lightning—this is the precelestial medicine within the postnatal. Immediately apply the first Chariot to circulate it to the *niwan*, where it first transforms into liquid. Ingesting it, one obtains the *yuye dantou* (Jade Fluid Elixir Head). This is the beginning of obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Thereafter, the work must be continuous and unbroken, deepening the root and securing the stem. This is the subtlety of fully nurturing the elixir; for further details, see the explanation below.\n\nThe second River Chariot, the practice of circulating essence, is for drawing out the lead from Kan (Water) and restraining the mercury of Li (Fire), refining one’s nature. Previously, after circulating *qi* for a long time, one obtained the minor medicine and congealed the elixir head. Thereafter, the internal breath flows naturally and effortlessly, firmly guarding the *dantian*. Each morning, while sitting or lying in clarity, the elixir rises to the heart’s palace like a soft ball of cotton. It must be gathered back into the Void, vanishing without a trace, to prevent its loss. The secret says: *“When the spirit returns to the body, the *qi* naturally follows.”* This is precisely that moment. As the embrace deepens over time, suddenly the *dantian* feels like spring water newly born, rippling and flowing. Guard the natural internal breath, refining and tempering it. The water suddenly transforms into hot *qi*, flowing from the inner sides of both hips to the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring). The spirit must focus on the heels, the true breath following—this is what is meant by *“the true person’s breath reaches the heels.”* After a short while, when the *yongquan* settles into stillness, return the heart to the *weilu*, silently guarding and awaiting. Suddenly, one senses something at the *weilu*—soft like cotton, like a steamed bun, like a mass of *qi*, heavy and sluggish, difficult to move. Immediately adjust the internal breath, concentrate the mind single-pointedly, and intensely refine it. Then, a stream of hot liquid surges from the *weilu*, slowly passing through the spine and surging up to the *niwan*. Only then is it called the Yellow River flowing backward, the canal reversed in its course.\n\nThis type of river chariot is what the *Dadong Jing* calls *\"harnessing essence to reach the Mud Pill Palace,\"* and what Ancestor Lü describes as *\"transporting essence into the upper palace\"*—it is not the same as circulating *qi*. Within the Mud Pill Palace, the sound of rushing water resonates, and after a long while, the water’s sound ceases, and the spirit rests within it. After maintaining this for a short time, press the tongue upward against the palate, hold the breath in the nose, clench the jaw tightly, brace both hands against the seat, and tilt the head back to face the empty beam. Wait until the golden liquid fills the tongue, then hold the nasal breath without exhaling. With a single gulp, it flows into the windpipe, descending the twelve-tiered tower of the *chonglou*, and the divine water irrigates the Flowery Pond.\n\nThis Flowery Pond is unknown to most. Some say it lies beneath the tongue’s root, others claim it is the lower *dantian*—both are incorrect. This Flowery Pond resides between the two breasts, called the upper *qi* sea, separated from the *xuanying* by a single layer. As Bai Yuchan states: *\"The Flowery Pond lies precisely within the qi sea.\"* When the water fills the Flowery Pond, it flows without being retained. Reaching the Crimson Palace, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Settling into the Yellow Court, the heart-fire attains supreme stillness. This is called *\"drawing lead to restrain mercury, guiding the tiger to subdue the dragon.\"* Once the two trigrams are united, they circulate endlessly—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid.\n\nYet this jade liquid cannot be produced daily; one must first apply the earlier *qi*-circulating practice. After several cycles, it may arise once. When one reaches the stage where jade liquid flows continuously, the Yellow Center becomes pervaded with principle, the skin grows lustrous, the heart-monarch rests in leisure, and the nature-body shines with radiance. Facing circumstances, one forgets emotion; in desire, one transcends desire. Living in the world yet apart from it, the true intent becomes unshakable, the sword’s edge keen. Round and full, luminous and bright, red and pure, gleaming and sharp—this is the time when self-refinement is perfected.\n\nHere, one may proceed to the three chariots’ work, as the following section will explain.\n\n**The Third River Chariot**\nThis involves circulating the primordial essence-*qi*, which the alchemists call *\"mercury welcoming lead,\"* the return of passion to nature, the work of seven reversals and nine returns. Once self-refinement is perfected, the mercury-nature becomes spiritually responsive, advancing and retreating freely, the feminine and masculine adapting to change. Only at this stage can one undertake the great work of return and restoration.\n\nThe seven reversals and return of the elixir begin by taking the already-formed mercury-nature and calling it the inner elixir. Then, entering the chamber and sitting in a circle, one conceals the inner elixir within the hollow void. Above resembles *Qian*, below resembles *Kun*; the nature-side pertains to being, the life-side to non-being. First, one must enter non-being from being, then generate being from non-being.\n\nIts image resembles *Qian*’s essence sown into *Kun* the Mother, where *Kun* fills its belly and becomes *Kan*. *Kun*’s essence stirs from *Qian* the Father, where *Qian* empties its heart and becomes *Li*. Once *Qian* and *Kun* are arrayed, they are called the crucible (the wondrous aperture of being and non-being). The dual functions of *Li* and *Kan* manifest through this.\n\nAt the moment of entering non-being from being, all is silent and still—heart dead, spirit preserved. Soon, one’s own consciousness transforms into things that startle or entice, testing the inner spirit. Then, the demonic generals of the heavens take form as good or evil figures, further testing the inner spirit. If undisturbed by any of these, the primordial spirit remains serene.\n\nAfter a time, a single yang qi arises—like the return of one yang beneath *Kun*’s yin. I then exhale a yin from *Qian*’s palace to welcome it (kidney qi ascending, heart fluid descending, all by nature’s course), called *\"mercury welcoming lead,\"* or *\"the great exchange of Kan and Li,\"* or *\"the ebb and flow of inner and outer yin-yang.\"* Once this flow is established, the Celestial Maiden Taiyi, accompanied by Qiu Lan, presents the feminine sword, plucks it, and sets it as the elixir’s foundation—this is the seven-reversal returning elixir.\n\nWith the elixir’s foundation laid, spirit and qi harmonize. The single yang gradually grows into *Dui*, and the *Kan* male transforms into the *Dui* female (this is the time of metaphors like *\"the moon at Geng,\"* *\"the moon on the Western River,\"* or *\"the crescent moon\"*). Because of these two characters, *Dui* and *female*, alchemists call it the *\"first essence\"* or *\"heavenly water\"* (a classification by analogy—fools who practice blindly do so because they have not met a true teacher).\n\nWhen the alchemist gathers this first essence, it is called *\"drawing passion back to nature.\"* After five thousand forty-eight days, when it returns to the Yellow Way, it resembles the full moon of the fifteenth night, with metal and water in perfect roundness. Within the human body, this is the time when the primordial essence and qi surge in abundance.\n\nAt this stage, the practitioner must swiftly activate the great river chariot, transporting it to the Mud Pill Palace. Soon, a sweet fluid descends into the throat, as large as a sparrow’s egg or grape, neither musk nor honey, yet exquisitely fragrant—this is the nine-return golden liquid great elixir. When the Daoist ingests this golden liquid, it is then called *\"lead entering mercury,\"* *\"metal merging with wood,\"* *\"the posterior heaven returning to the prior heaven,\"* and *\"the infant meeting the maiden.\"*\n\nWhen the infant and maiden meet, they are nurtured day and night. Over time, the organs become visible, inner and outer radiance shines, and within, a true one appears, resembling oneself—this is the infant and maiden giving birth to another infant. One who attains this infant must quietly cultivate and cherish it, moving it from the Valley of Spirit to the Heavenly Valley. Then, one may transcend form, ascend to the assembly of immortals, and merge with the Dao.\n\n*Method for Gathering the Heart*\nWritten by Li Hanxu of Changyi Mountain\n\nChen Yingning of Wanjian’s Collated *Method for Gathering the Heart* – Preface in Verse\n\nThe *Method for Gathering the Heart* unfolds plainly and directly,\nHeaven rejoices, free from blame or reproach.\nYear after year, tirelessly driving the river chariot,\nThe heart seems laborious yet is truly at ease.\n\nLast night, the spirit soared to pay homage to the Upper Perfected,\nWho sealed me as the Great Perfected of the Teachings of Goodness.\nThe Dao recounted my affairs of four hundred years,\nThree playful descents into the red dust.\n\nClasping the golden elixir, I alone savor its delight,\nYet I share with the assembly of immortals in silent riddles.\nAwakening, I first stir the heart of compassion,\nAnd with my own hand inscribe the *Record of the Jade Ring*.\n\nDistinguishing neither good nor evil, wise nor foolish,\nAll must gather the heart and sit in emptiness.\nOnly by entering profound obscurity does one behold the Dao—\nThe very first step is the finest effort.\n\n*Fundamental Practice in the Method for Gathering the Heart*\n\nThe Dao of nurturing life takes true breathing as its root.\nAs Cao Wenyi said: *“I shall tell you gentlemen the truth:\nThe stem of life has always resided in true breathing.”*\nThese are indeed essential words.\n\nThe initial practice begins with quieting the heart,\nThen sealing the mouth,\nThen regulating the breath (when the heart is still, the qi is level—\nThe unregulated regulation is supreme).\n\nOnce the nasal breath is calm and harmonious,\nClose the eyes and inwardly observe,\nDirecting the spirit to the root of the kidneys, below the Yin Bridge meridian\n(Before the Valley Gate, behind the scrotum).\nAfter a short while, lift the heart-breath upward into the Cavity of Emptiness\n(Behind the navel, before the waist, between the heart and kidneys—\nDo not cling rigidly to this location).\nRest the spirit and settle the breath,\nTaking naturalness as the guiding principle.\n\nIf the heart is too severe, it burns—\nOne must follow its natural course: this is the civil fire.\nIf the heart is too scattered, it chills—\nOne must guard its natural state: this is the martial fire.\nThe civil and martial fires refine and temper,\nTheir wondrous application enduring from start to finish.\n\nWhen the inner breath is even and balanced,\nNeither forget nor force it.\nAt this moment, the heart is like empty space:\nWith breath as its companion, it is not empty;\nWith breath as its follower, it is not void.\nBetween non-emptiness and non-void,\nStillness upon stillness,\nPurity upon purity.\n\nThe breath flows ceaselessly,\nThe heart-spirit silently.\nAt this point, release all things,\nForget both self and others—\nThis is called *boring into profound obscurity*.\n\nWithin profound obscurity, there is qi,\nA single spirit alone awakens—\nThis is true breathing.\nWhen true breathing manifests,\nIt warms the heart with a melting, tingling sensation.\nOne must press it back into the Cavity of Emptiness within the body’s chamber,\nAccumulating and layering it,\nSo that the stem of life grows and yang qi naturally lengthens—\nOnly then can one open the passes and circulate the qi.\n\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath\nAre the fundamental practices.\nConcentrating the spirit means gathering the already-cleansed heart and entering within.\nWhen the heart is not yet clear, do not close the eyes inwardly.\nFirst, encourage and urge oneself,\nDrawing it back,\nCool and serene,\nThen gather it into the qi cavern—\nThis is called *concentrating the spirit*.\n\nSitting in emptiness,\nNeither leaning nor tilting—\nThis is concentrating the spirit in the void.\nRegulating the breath is not difficult:\nWhen the heart-spirit is still,\nThe breath follows naturally.\nI merely guard and follow it,\nIlluminating it with the spirit’s light—\nThis is regulation.\n\nDirecting the breath of the Yin Bridge\nTo meet the heart’s breath within the qi cavern—\nThe spirit resides within the qi,\nSilently focusing on the primordial sea.\nWithout union, they unite of themselves;\nWithout contact, they connect of themselves—\nThis is called *spiritual union across the body’s divide*.\n\nGuard one’s nature, preventing dispersion.\nPreserve the spirit, avoiding dullness,\nThus entering profound obscurity and subtle indistinction.\n\nWhen the spirit halts below the navel, it is called *concentrating the spirit*.\nWhen the qi returns below the navel, it is called *regulating the breath*.\nSpirit and breath interdependent,\nGuarding their natural purity—this is *not forgetting*.\nFollowing their natural purity—this is *not forcing*.\nNeither forgetting nor forcing,\nIn silence and softness,\nThe breath becomes lively and the heart at ease.\nEmploy the *boring* technique,\nTaking emptiness as the heart’s dwelling,\nAnd profound obscurity as the spirit-breath’s homeland.\n\nAfter two or three attempts,\nClarifying again and again,\nSuddenly, heart and breath forget each other,\nSpirit and qi merge—\nUnawares, yang stirs in a flash of enlightenment.\n\n*Miscellaneous Discussions on the Method for Gathering the Heart*\n\nA disciple asked: *“The secret of the Three Vehicles has been fully revealed—\nDoes this not risk heavenly reproach?”*\nHanxu replied: *“I dare not defy heavenly reproach,\nBut hope that people may reform and renew themselves.\nIn all practice, one must first discard the human heart\nAnd seek the heart of the Dao.\nSet aside ordinary breathing\nAnd seek true breathing.\nThen stabilize spirit and qi,\nAnd bore into profound obscurity.\nNone of these stages can be omitted.\nHow could one who enters my Dao remain a petty person?”*\n\n*“In all practice, boring into profound obscurity is the most difficult task.\nYet the primordial qi arises from emptiness—\nOnly with true profound obscurity\nDoes true emptiness exist.\nAlas! First difficulty, then attainment—\nOne must be willing to relinquish the whole self.\nIn the past, I spent seven or eight years in the grotto-heaven\nLearning to bore into profound obscurity,\nAnd only then gained a slight grasp.\nToday’s learners advance swiftly but retreat just as fast—\nHow can they enter the Dao?”*\n\nA disciple asked: *“Master, you transmit the Dao so freely—\nIf an inferior person obtains it and fails in practice,\nWill they not turn and revile you?”*\nHanxu replied: *“Without the ridicule of inferior persons,\nHow could the greatness of my Dao be seen?\nThe Great Dao first requires purifying body and mind,\nRegulating spirit and qi.\nAt its deepest, one must be able to release all things\nAnd bore into profound obscurity.\nOnly with such true effort\nWill true efficacy appear.\nThose who lack effort yet vainly seek results\nWill forever remain without them.\nWhy be troubled by their revilement?”*\n\nA disciple asked: *“As you describe it, can even evil people learn the Dao?”*\nHanxu replied: *“Yes.\nI shall recite the admonition:\n*‘All that came before is like yesterday’s death.\nAll that follows is like today’s birth.’*\nRefrain from all evil,\nPractice all good—\nThen one can transform hell into heaven,\nAnd change black qi into crimson light.”*\n\nI possess a three-word formula for those who cultivate the Dao: diligence, sincerity, and constancy—none may be lacking. Yet though one be diligent and sincere, the ultimate outcome must rest in constancy. Confucius said: *“A man without constancy cannot even be a shaman or physician—how much less can he grasp the Dao?”* Confucian scholars study literature and arts, setting years—even a decade—as their term. How could the refinement of mind and tempering of qi require less than the reading of books or writing of essays?\n\nSincerity is the supreme yin image: in the *Book of Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is *tathatā*. Mencius said: *“There has never been one who was perfectly sincere yet unmoved. Without sincerity, none can move others.”* When “movement” is spoken of in contrast to “stillness,” we know sincerity is a yin image. The Dao of Confucius’ school exalts perfect sincerity as spirit-like, and perfect spirit as ceaseless—both are the great essence and great function of stillness. Thus, entering stillness with sincerity stills the heart without disorder; entering concentration with sincerity fixes the heart without wavering; guarding the center with sincerity keeps the center without bias; entering profound obscurity with sincerity unobstructedly penetrates the subtle. Diligence is the foundation of learning, and in the Dao, there is an even deeper “diligence within non-diligence.” Nurturing the breath of spontaneity, settling the mind of spontaneity, acting without acting, and acting yet not acting—what is called *“subtly continuous as if existing, its use never exhausted”* is truly the utmost of diligence.\n\nTo subdue the demon of sleep, one must employ diligence. Racing incense and seated meditation that exhaust the spirit are misapplications of diligence. Those skilled in refining sleep sleep yet do not sleep, do not sleep yet remain watchful—effort naturally continues unbroken, and spirit and qi naturally increase. Staying up through the night instead invites the sleep demon. The *Cantong Qi* says: *“Sleep and wakefulness ever embrace; vigilance discerns presence and absence.”* Mastering this formula, one remains naturally clear and unwavering.\n\nA disciple asked: *“Master Lu Qianxu said: ‘The union of yin and yang is the Most High’s most secret teaching.’ May we hear its formula?”*\nI replied: The union of yin and yang is the root of supreme yin and the foundation of profound obscurity. Only by boring into profound obscurity can one achieve this union. I advise first refining within emptiness—stillness upon stillness, concentration upon concentration—until there is no self, no other, not even “nothingness.” Naturally, one enters profound obscurity, and without seeking union, union occurs spontaneously, giving birth to supreme yang from within supreme yin.\n\nThe method of union differs between pre-heaven and post-heaven. Pre-heaven union establishes life through nature; post-heaven union unites spirit with qi. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredients* says: *“It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor.”* Pre-heaven has but a single name; post-heaven distinguishes essence, spirit, intent, qi, hun, po, nature, and emotion. In pre-heaven, refining one suffices—all are present. The key is to extract true yang through union.\n\nThe five viscera in the human body have their fixed positions—none may be shifted. Daoists speak of *“inverting Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,”* but how could the heart be moved downward or the kidneys upward? Not so. What is inverted is the spirit and qi within the heart and kidneys: the heart’s spirit descends to meet, the kidneys’ qi ascends to rise. When spirit and qi invert, even the physical heart and kidneys seem inverted, and the formless Qian and Kun likewise invert. Through inverted exchange, a single yang is born within Kun to form Kan, and a single yin is born within Qian to form Li. The Li maiden and Kan youth exchange, like the Dui maiden of the west joining the Zhen youth of the east. South and north shift to east and west, water and fire transform into metal and wood. Metal’s emotion and wood’s nature become the White Tiger and Azure Dragon. When the dragon unites with the tiger, it is like the maiden embracing the infant; when the tiger unites with the dragon, it is like the infant embracing the maiden. In essence, these are the two of nature and life. Within life is nature, within nature is life—two yet one. Thus, Master Ziyang said: *“Zhen and Dui are not east and west; Kan and Li are not south and north.”* One may now comprehend this.\n\nConfucians and Daoists cultivate qi differently. Nurturing the qi of spontaneity can preserve life; nurturing the qi of vastness can embrace both life and death. From ancient times, the resolute and humane—those who risked danger to fulfill their mission or died to perfect their humanity—did so. When cultivating this qi, it is purely the heart of principle, filling the cosmos. Thus, Mencius said: *“This qi is supremely great and firm. Nurtured with uprightness and unharmed, it fills the space between heaven and earth—it is born of accumulated righteousness.”*\n\nDaoists cultivate qi by preserving their true nature, neither waiting for danger to retreat nor death to hide. They are the *“noble ones who act upon perceiving the moment, not waiting for the day’s end”* spoken of in the *Book of Changes*. In the Daoist initial practice, one must nurture the qi of spontaneity. What is this qi of spontaneity? The *Book of Changes* says: *“This qi is supremely small and soft, bending yet nurtured without harm. It gathers within emptiness—born of accumulated essence.”*\n\nThe Daoist elixir of return is also the qi of vastness. Once attained, it too can face danger to fulfill a mission or die to perfect humanity. Since ancient times, this has been called *“knife liberation,”* possessing unfathomable marvels and inexplicable transformations, distinct from Confucianism. Some, after death, reappear elsewhere with youthful features, traveling as immortals—this is the accomplishment of the returned elixir, a body beyond the body. The perfected who attain the Dao live as immortals and die as immortals, whether leaving their forms behind or ascending through liberation.\n\nThe humane can attain stillness—living long, dying long—like Master Zeng preserving his body or Yan Yuan’s brief life. There are five failures on the Dao: some taste and depart; some superficially admire its name; some begin diligently but end in slackness; some, with stubborn natures yet uninitiated, rashly slander its profundity; some, of dull disposition, remain deaf to calls and blind to awakening. There are three attainments on the Dao: those who know it may become spirit-people; those who love it may become perfected people; those who delight in it may become supreme people.\n\n**Postnatal Sequential Exposition Concludes (Volume Three)**\n\nI have written commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, *Dadong Jing*, and *Wugen Jing*, all expounding the function of the prenatal, not the gateway for beginners. To journey far, one starts nearby; to ascend high, one begins low. Without clarity on the postnatal sequence, it is like aspiring to become a *jinshi* or *hanlin* without first passing the *maocai* or *xiaolian* examinations. Thus, I composed *Postnatal Sequential Exposition* as the path of entry, comprising nine stages:\n\n1. Gathering the mind\n2. Seeking qi\n3. Congealing spirit\n4. Expanding the apertures\n5. Opening the passes\n6. Laying the foundation\n7. Obtaining the medicine\n8. Coalescing the elixir\n9. Refining the self\n\nThe Most High said: “Nobility takes humility as its root; height takes lowliness as its foundation.” Postnatal cultivation is the Way of the humble and lowly. Humility is what the master calls *“speaking of the unsightly.”* Lowliness is what the *Scripture* calls *“taking from below.”* To nurture the elixir’s foundation, essence and qi are treasured as jewels. In practice, one must first gather the mind inward, taking the center as the pole, harmony as the principle, spirit as the substance (stillness), and intention as the function (wisdom).\n\nSeeking qi begins with the yinqiao vessel, where it is lively and fluid, neither seen nor heard. Harmony is the work of concentrating qi to softness, embracing spirit in stillness. From stillness wisdom arises; seated illumination returns to its origin. Mating primordial essence generates primordial qi, and expanding the apertures to open the passes becomes effortless.\n\nPrimordial essence is the yinqiao meridian’s daily-generated human qi. The practitioner must seek the qi’s active locus and unite it with stillness—this is called the union of spirit and qi. When spirit and qi unite, male and female essences mate, and the true seed is transformed. The true seed is the postnatal crucible’s true qi. The postnatal crucible is where primordial spirit and primordial qi conjoin, hence named the *spirit-father* and *spirit-mother*. When this qi is refined from the crucible, one must congeal the spirit, soften the intention, and use softness to restrain hardness, naturally entering one’s inner crucible. Harmonize, regulate, forge, and refine it, concealing it within the cinnabar field, breathing within the void—this is called the *life-stem* or *embryonic breathing*.\n\nSuddenly, within the inner crucible, something surges forth, leaping and bounding, hissing and puffing, ascending through the thrusting vessel to the heart’s palace—this is the moment of expanding the apertures. When its force is potent, transform spirit into intention, guide it out from the coccyx, striking the three passes to soar to the mud-pill palace—this is opening the passes. Once the passes and apertures are open, proceed with the work of self-nurturance and discuss laying the foundation.\n\nLaying the foundation means drawing their qi and blood to replenish one’s spirit. Though spirit may be robust, fearing its instability, one uses *ren lead* to restrain it. *Ren lead* is born of the union of the two qi. The qi of the *kan* palace is earthly qi; the qi of the *li* palace is heavenly qi. When heaven and earth conjoin, chaos swirls, misty and dense, coalescing into the *Cavern of the Void*. Within the Cavern of the Void, a qi is born—this qi is *ren lead*, the moment of obtaining lead.\n\nLead’s nature is qi without substance, thus it is clear and ascends. Upon reaching Kunlun, direct the gaze upward so spirit and qi rest in the crown. After a time of congealment, yang reaches its peak and yin arises. Then, press the tongue against the upper palate, regulate the breath, and after prolonged contact, sweet nectar descends like cold springs, drop by drop. Though not abundant, swallow it down the *heavy tower*, sending it with intention to the yellow court. Strangely, a sound like crashing waves arises—one realizes celestial sweet dew is not easily obtained. Descending into the yellow court, it coalesces into the inner elixir.\n\nThereafter, one must sever desire while in desire, transcend dust while in dust, forget essence amid circumstances, refine lead to subdue mercury, expel the three corpses and five thieves, and dissolve the six desires and seven emotions. Bones and qi become golden essence; skin and flesh turn to jade. Then, inner celestial mechanisms align with outer human affairs—no deliberation, no insistence, no rigidity, no self. Accumulate merit, refine qi, and nurture spirit; as things arise and events occur, the mind’s realm naturally radiates light. Meeting scenes with the heart, the wisdom-sword cleaves through dusty obstructions. Cultivating merit in the human realm, one’s name resounds in heaven. Feasting on celestial emoluments, one enjoys boundless longevity.\n\nAt this stage, embrace simplicity and guard integrity, vigilant against peril and danger. Heaven and humanity unite in manifestation; the myriad transformations settle their foundation. Spirit is eternally firm; qi returns to the void—this completes the work of self-refinement. Beginners must first gather the mind, seek qi, congeal spirit, expand the apertures, open the passes, lay the foundation, obtain the medicine, coalesce the elixir, and refine the self—these nine stages are the gateway to the Dao. Once entered, yin and yang return to unity, and there is no going without return. Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny, one moves from effort to effortlessness, from striving to spontaneity—there has never been a case where the golden elixir failed to form.\n\n**Volume Four: Record of Following the Path**\n*(Conclusion of the Scripture on Ninefold Heart Refinement in the Great Dao of Human Primordiality)*\n*Handwritten by Hanxuzi, Master of the Purple Radiance Grotto*\n\n**(Discourse on Ninefold Heart Refinement)**\n\n**First Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the unpurified heart. The unpurified heart teems with delusive thoughts and wandering musings. Delusive thoughts arise from craving and desire; wandering musings spring from unawareness. When practitioners sit in meditation, though they may wish to banish worldly concerns, no sooner are delusive thoughts dispelled than wandering musings arise anew. The method lies in *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation), through which they may gradually dissolve and refine. *Zhi* means to cease at the space behind the navel’s hall and before the Gate of Life, slightly below its center, where there is a circle of emptiness and void. The heart ceases there and inwardly contemplates, its illumination shining within the void, guarding the qi. It is bound within the compass and square, moving between the circle and the square, each breath returning to the root, uniting with the natural workings of creation. Immovable as a mountain, it establishes the primordial foundation of purity and stillness. From this, a single thread of heart-light connects with a wisp of true qi, merging in profound vastness, tranquil and at ease—this is the initial work of refining the heart and nurturing qi.\n\n**Second Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart in samādhi. Previously, the single thread of heart-light connected with the wisp of true qi; if it could penetrate directly into profound obscurity, it would naturally emerge through the Mysterious Aperture. Yet the heart in samādhi is not steadfast, often swayed by the *shishen* (discriminating spirit), causing heart and qi to separate, and the original face remains unseen. The method lies in the moment when heart and breath interdepend: extinguish all knowing and awareness. The heart abides within qi yet knows it not; qi envelops the heart yet is not perceived. In a state of misty fusion, they become one—this is the work of refining the heart to unite with qi.\n\n**Third Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the returning heart. Previously, in misty fusion, they became one; beneath the heavy yin, a single yang returns—this is called the heart of Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Pass. At this moment, essence, qi, and spirit all reside in the primordial, the initial separation of the primordial chaos, undivided into true essence, true qi, and true spirit—yet this *is* true essence, true qi, and true spirit. If the heart can remain unmoving, one may immediately gather and circulate them. Yet, encountering sights unseen and sounds unheard, with wondrous scenes before one, one is at a loss; the heart stirs and falls into the posterior heaven, and essence, qi, and spirit separate. The method lies in the moment the Mysterious Pass first appears: immediately tread the fire-clouds, proceed to the *weilü* (coccyx), steady the heart, soften the breath, strike the iron drum to pass the Three Barriers, and rest upon Kunlun—this is the work of refining the heart to advance qi.\n\n**Fourth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the withdrawing and storing heart. Previously, treading the fire-clouds and passing the Three Barriers, heart and qi followed and entered the *nīwán* (Mud Pill Palace). Yet within the *nīwán* Palace, if the *shishen* stirs, the qi chills and congeals, failing to transform into true water, sprinkle, and irrigate the Three Palaces—all prior efforts are lost. The method lies atop Kunlun’s summit: still the heart and abide in quiescence, merging with qi. The qi then transforms into sweet nectar, descending from the upper palate. Curl the tongue to receive the dew, swallow and guide it, pouring the heart into the *jiàngōng* (Crimson Palace), the *huángtíng* (Yellow Court), and the *yuánhǎi* (Primordial Sea), the sound of its passage resonating all the way down. Wait again for the appearance of the Mysterious Pass—this is the work of refining the heart to obtain qi.\n\n**Fifth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart for foundation-laying. Previously, entering the *nīwán* and returning to the qi cavern, the path of the River Chariot is established. From this, proceed with single-minded devotion, day and night without rest—how can the foundation fail to form within a hundred days? Yet if there is laxity or desire, with starts and stops, the elixir foundation will not solidify. Foundation-laying gathers essence and unites spirit; if effort is not diligent, essence and spirit remain scattered—how can one prolong life and serve the Dao? The method lies in following the *zǐ-wǔ* (midnight-noon) cycle, daily drawing and adding, extracting from *kǎn* (Water) to fill *lí* (Fire), accumulating gold to solidify the abdomen—this is the work of refining the heart to accumulate qi.\n\n**Sixth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart to complete nature. Previously, with the River Chariot turning and essence gathered to unite spirit, the numinous root is replete. From this, heart-fluid descends and kidney-qi ascends—this is the union of *kǎn* and *lí*. In profound obscurity, there is a sign, vast as the tide: half is water-qi, misty as fog; half is cloud-qi—this is the initial stirring of metal and water, the stage of refining the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir. If the heart is not single-minded, the task of completing nature remains unfinished. The method lies in the moment when metal and water first arise: from the cinnabar field, they divide and descend to the *yǒngquán* (Bubbling Spring), instantly converging at the *weilü*. Harmonize the true breath, stir and dance it, so it surges upward to the Heavenly Valley; trickling down, it falls into the Yellow Court. Thus, irrigating daily, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Blood transforms into cream, intent congeals into earth, and within earth, mercury is born. Mercury’s nature is round and luminous, unchanging in encounter with things—like a spirit-sword in hand. Mencius said, “He who exhausts his heart knows his nature.” Daoists call this the Yin Elixir or Inner Elixir—this is the work of refining the heart to illuminate nature.\n\n**Seventh Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-illumined nature. Previously, the River Chariot of metal and water was called “inner refinement” by the immortals. At this stage, there is still the work of outer refinement. By uniting outer with inner, the true heart gathers and does not scatter. Though the inner body is illuminated, mercury’s nature is prone to flight; though inner refinement is achieved, the Yin Elixir is easily corrupted. If preservation is not pure, the heart-nature is extinguished once more. The method lies in blending the emptily luminous heart and the wondrously existent nature with cinnabar and earth, planting them in that domain.\n\nThat domain is empty, yet I fill it with substance; that domain is nonexistent, yet I bring it into being. Casting the existent into the nonexistent, infusing the substantial into the void. The dead heart remains unmoved, and in an instant, the primordial qi emerges from the formless. The first period manifests as one Yang, akin to *Zhen*. The second period manifests as two Yangs, akin to *Dui*. At the moment of the second period, it is precisely the time to conjoin the Elixir. From that side issues a thread of true qi—its metaphor is the tiger born from water. From this side descends a speck of mysterious radiance—its metaphor is the dragon emerging from fire. The two, dragon and tiger, meet in union; nature and destiny intermingle in mutual resonance. A great battle ensues, as though heaven and earth were plunged into darkness, and both body and heart become utterly still.\n\nSuddenly, the three Yangs stir into motion, akin to *Qian*. Like tides, like fire, like mist, like smoke, like thunder, like lightning, like snow, like blossoms—within the body, the Yang lead shines brilliantly. I then wield the sword, grasp the seal, tread the *gang*, pace the *dou*, rousing the primordial harmony. With fierce firing and extreme refinement, it pierces the Three Passes and ascends to the *Niwan*, every pore of the body opening—unlike the earlier Jade Liquid River Chariot. Swallowing and ingesting it, the primordial governs the acquired; nature and destiny merge into one—this is the Great Return. Nature pertains to fire, its number seven. Destiny pertains to metal, its number nine. Returning to the origin and reverting to the source, thus is revealed the seven-return, nine-reversion, and the Golden Liquid Great Elixir. Henceforth, lead comes to restrain mercury, the heart remains ever luminous, and mercury ceases to waver. This is the work of refining the heart to preserve spirit.\n\n**Eighth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-subdued heart to enable communion with spirit. Previously, the seven-return, nine-reversion, with lead restraining mercury, has stilled the heart. Yet it must be warmed and nurtured, so that the qi within the body wholly transforms into spirit, and the spirit within the body can roam beyond. Thus, taking the twelve months of the year, excluding the *mao* and *you* months for bathing, the remaining ten months are for advancing and retreating—hence the term \"ten-month nurturing,\" not implying ten months of effort. Otherwise, though the heart is stilled, it remains inert. Refining and forging it, the numinous heart becomes daily more apparent. Numinous, it moves; moving, it transforms; transforming, it transfigures—thus arises the phenomenon of spirit departing, no longer deluded by worldly sentiments. This is the work of refining the heart into spirit.\n\n**Ninth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-numinous heart to return it to emptiness. Previously, the work of nurturing ran deep, and the spirit, having emerged, is no longer confused. Following the heart’s desire, all is fitting; treading upon clouds and mist, traversing the isles of the sea—such is the joy attained. Yet if the numinous heart is not empty, it cannot embrace the ten thousand existences. Thus arises the necessity of refining emptiness. Refining emptiness, the heart’s vastness expands, and the myriad existences all become nonexistent. A single qi of pure emptiness spirals between heaven and earth. It is I, yet not I; it is emptiness, yet not emptiness. Though the world may perish, only emptiness remains indestructible. Though the cosmos may obstruct, only emptiness knows no hindrance—thus the spirit fills the void, and the Dharma pervades the realms of the sands. This is the beginning and end of heart refinement; nothing surpasses it.\n\nThe immortals take Laozi as their patriarch. In his dealings with the world, Laozi never contended with others. Outwardly, he relinquished glory and splendor; inwardly, he cultivated longevity. Serene, harmonious, settled, and still—non-action in accord with nature. Yet in non-action, all the world’s heterodox arts, restless clamor, bizarre and strange conduct, cunning schemes, and tumultuous deceits are not of Laozi’s teaching. To say \"natural\" is to act and move in accord with feeling and reason, flowing with the transformations of creation. Abiding in the center without bounds, contemplating emptiness without form. Attaining emptiness and preserving stillness, deeply concealed yet seemingly vacant. Neither flaunting the extraordinary nor establishing the peculiar, thus the histories call him an ancient reclusive gentleman. The *Daodejing*’s five thousand words draw upon ancient sayings to establish its discourse. It may be applied to governing the world and cultivating the self. Though we, in our daily reading of the *Daodejing*, may not grasp its profound meaning, in our hearts and conduct, we secretly aspire to emulate it. In the depths of mountains and secluded valleys, two or three like-minded companions keep company, wandering amidst mist and clouds, staff in hand, singing of the sagely transformation—unaware, unknowing, following the patterns of the Emperor on High, using this as a means to conceal our inadequacies.\n\nOne day, while visiting a Daoist abbey, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, which expounds the learning of extending life without straying from Laozi’s Dao. Among them was the *Thirteen Classics with Annotations*, all works of Laozi. The commentary on the *Daodejing* was the most refined and detailed. Appended at the end was the *Nine Layers of the Path*, even more accessible and plain. I inquired of a Daoist priest, \"Who is the Master of the Tree’s Shade?\" He replied, \"A recluse among farmers.\" Thus, I sought the master at Juanshan, and he deemed me a kindred spirit to [Xu] You and [Ni] Qian. He imparted to me the true mechanism. Upon returning, I had the *Thirteen Classics* printed and placed in bookshops to manifest the master’s compassionate intent. Additionally, copies of the *Daodejing* and *Nine Layers* were printed and distributed to Daoist and Buddhist temples.\n\nThis book is concise in length yet complete in true instructions. For our small circle, it is convenient to practice and study, fulfilling ourselves and others—does not its potential lie herein? Reflecting on the master’s words about accepting disciples, each of us, following the Daoist lineage, established names for ourselves beyond the worldly realm, like streams and rivulets flowing into the great river. Zixia received teachings from Huiweng, and we, as his successors, share a deep connection. Alas! Among the affairs of heaven and earth, those like us few fools neither need nor are able to contend.\n\nAt seventy, Daoyu’s years have grown long; Daosheng, too, nears the threshold of old age; and Daohe is no longer young. What joy can there be within these mountain forests? Only that we bear this single commentary on the *Daodejing* and this single chapter of the *Nine Layers*, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing through the clouds over the streams—each forgetting our surnames and ages.\n\nIn the month of *Nánlǚ* during the *Dūnyīn* year of the Daoguang reign, inscribed by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu.\n\n**Preface by Master Pure Yang**\n\nThe *Daodejing* of Lord Lao teaches \"non-action as action.\" The *Zhengyi* commentary elucidates \"non-doing as doing.\" The Dao Ancestor transmitted it; his descendants expounded it, making the Great Dao ever clearer. Then there is one called Hanxuzi, a transcendent talent: golden script entered his dreams, and he was born into a family beneath the trees. His lineage, dwelling in Juanshan, has long transmitted purity and sincerity. That he was endowed with a jade scepter was only fitting.\n\nFrom childhood, he possessed extraordinary insight; in maturity, he cultivated the mysterious. Once he read the *Fanghu Waishi*, he secretly aspired to ascend to truth and enter transformation, standing beside Master Lu at my side. Hearing of him, I sought him out, assuming the guise of a mountain Daoist. I brought Qianyu with me to observe his resolve. He dwelt in seclusion on the eastern slopes of Mount E, serene and taciturn, indifferent to glory and profit, often contenting himself with a single qin to express his will.\n\nAfter we met, we kept company for years. I often spoke to him of the profound mystery, and he grasped it instantly. Thereupon, he exerted his talent and composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, a counterpart to Master Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has the *Xuanfu Lun*, he has the *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has the *Jiuzheng Pian*, he has the *Xuntu Shuo*—all works of pure truth. Yet his most wondrous achievement is his commentary on the *Daodejing*, which serves as an eternal lamp for all ages. He titled it *Donglai Zhengyi*, standing equal to Master Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo*. These two masters may truly be called those who excel in discoursing on Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn annotating this scripture, there are five faults and three virtues. The five faults are: leaning toward governance of the world, the first; leaning toward cultivation of the self, the second; or knowing the Dao encompasses both self and world yet failing to align one’s words, ultimately straying into side paths, the third; not recognizing that the supreme Dao’s practice requires first pacifying the people and enriching the state to achieve non-action—if one begins by discussing stillness, it will inevitably drift into emptiness, the fourth; not recognizing that the supreme power of virtue demands returning to the root and restoring life to be deemed \"having action\"—if one begins by discussing sagehood and divinity, it will inevitably resemble mere hymns of praise, the fifth.\n\nWhat are the three virtues? Harmonizing inner and outer, the commentary distinguishes primary and secondary, further revealing the scripture’s vast meaning—this is the first virtue. Connecting the lineage’s sprouts and veins, filling gaps and ensuring coherence, so the scripture’s meaning flows unimpeded—this is the second virtue. With true realization in the heart and no Zen obstructions in speech, enabling the scripture’s meaning to shine forth—this is the third virtue.\n\nI have long lamented that the *Daodejing*’s essence remains obscure in the world, wishing to take up my brush and annotate it. Yet to this day, I remain unsatisfied. Now, seeing Hanxu’s work, which possesses the three virtues and avoids the five faults, had it appeared a thousand years earlier, other commentators would have had no need to annotate it, and Daoists would not have had to speak further.\n\nThus, I joyfully undertake its evaluation and annotation, storing it in the famous mountains and transmitting it to scholars of aspiration. The purpose of this evaluation is also to borrow the true meaning of this commentary to supplement what I have not annotated, revealing it through these annotations.\n\n**Poem on the *Donglai Zhengyi***\n\nMaster Huiweng’s preface sets the critique,\nHis own preface further opens the gate to virtue.\nAgain, we see purple qi arriving from Guanzhong,\nDirectly beholding the flourishing descendants of Li’s lineage.\nWishing to guide later generations to share the same path,\nAble to make the primordial Dao ever more revered.\nHow many commentators lack such a work?\nThe treasure case is long guarded, enshrined on Kunlun.\n\n—Sealed by the Jade Pivot Right Minister, Censor of Cultivation and Transgressions in the Great Clarity Grotto Mystery, and Selector of Immortal Affairs, the Mysterious Mystic Daoist of Liaodong, Your Friend Zhang Quanyi, respectfully inscribed at Qingfu.\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nOne commentary can unlock the Dao’s profundities,\nOnce more, purple qi arrives from the east.\nA true scholar, plucking the qin and playing the flute,\nA great debater, expounding the scriptures and discoursing on the Dao.\nI dwell in Fanghu, gazing upon the azure sea,\nYou ascend Yuanqiao, pressing down Penglai.\nToday, seated together by the river pavilion,\nReciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly.\n\n—Sealed by the Grand Censor of the Three Clarities’ True Scriptures, Keeper of the Grotto Heavens’ Secret Treasures, Master of Civilized Universal Salvation, Ancestral Master of the Eastern Lineage, Fellow of the Immortal Historians’ Hall, Your Foolish Younger Brother Lu Xixing, respectfully inscribed.\n\n**Another Inscription**\n\nThe Dao resides in the body though the self dwells in clouded mountains,\nProfound and potent, the spirit’s qi is most majestic.\nWriting books beyond the isles of Qingdao and Yanchi,\nQuelling the flames of the cinnabar field in tranquil stillness.\nPeople call him the Great Abbot,\nI playfully dub him the Old Man of the Great Wall.\nRelying on this commentary to fence the *Daodejing*,\nAll scriptures’ words resonate in harmonious realization.\n\n—Respectfully inscribed by the Heavenly Immortal Bai Qiongguan.\n\n**Commentary on the *Daodejing* (*Dongyan Zhengyi*)**\nPurified and bathed in reverence, the Master of Purple Radiance Grotto of Yuanqiao Mountain, Hanxu Sheng, annotates.\nProofread and published by the Dao-following disciples Zhu Daosheng and Li Daoyu at Yueyang Tower.\n**Chapter One**\n\nThe Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nThat which is called the Dao—\ninwardly, it governs the self; outwardly, it governs the world,\nthe Dao of daily use and constant practice.\n\nThe Dao’s hidden subtlety cannot be spoken,\nyet its manifest signs can be spoken.\nEncompassing both manifest and hidden,\nit is at once most vast and most minute—\nthus the Dao is no ordinary Dao.\n\nThe name in the realm of the Limitless cannot be named,\nyet the name within the Supreme Ultimate can be named.\nBorn of the Limitless, the Supreme Ultimate,\nit is both still and moving—\nthus the name is no ordinary name.\n\n**Supplementary Note:**\nWhat all people follow is called the Dao.\nThat which can be spoken is what can be described.\nThe Dao that is not ordinary—this is the Great Dao.\n\nTo depict its form is called naming.\nThat which can be named is what can be likened.\nThe name that is not ordinary—this has no fixed name.\n\n“Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad things.”\nNameless—this is the Limitless.\nNamed—this is the Supreme Ultimate.\nFrom non-being to being,\ntruly, there is no fixed name.\n\nIn the primal undifferentiated state of the Limitless,\nthere were no omens, no forms,\nno sounds or scents to which it could be likened—\nthus the Dao is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.\nAfter the Supreme Ultimate divides,\nthere is generation and nurturance,\nevidence of creation to be observed—\nthus the Dao is the mother of the myriad things.\nThe “myriad things” refers to all under Heaven and Earth.\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth existed, this Dao already was—\ngiving birth to Heaven, to Earth, to humanity, to all things,\nas if a great father and mother.\nBy speaking of the mother, the father is implied.\n\n“Always without desire, observe its mystery;\nAlways with desire, observe its manifestations.”\n(*Manifestations* here meaning *apertures*.

Peng’s edition calls it the “Excellence” chapter.)\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, un-goodness arises.\nThus being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short shape each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other (high as above, inclining as reversal),\nSound and echo harmonize,\nFront and back follow one another (the character *xing* [形] in the phrase is rendered as *jiao* [较] in Wang Bi’s commentary).\n\n*Yi* [已] means cessation, or departure (*Guangyun*).\nBeauty and ugliness are most opposed.\nKnowing beauty as beauty, ugliness must cease.\nGoodness and un-goodness are most distant.\nKnowing goodness as goodness, un-goodness must depart.\n\nOur innate celestial truth is all beauty and goodness.\nOnly after being stained by the desires of the posterior world\ndo ugliness and un-goodness arise.\nYet one cannot but rid oneself of human desire\nand seek the celestial truth.\n\nOnly by taking emptiness and numinosity as essence,\ntransformation and movement as function,\ncan being arise from non-being, non-being from being;\nfirst difficulty, then ease;\nlong shapes short, short shapes long;\nhigh and low reverse;\nlike seeks like, as sound answers sound;\nthe child races behind,\nthen the noon sun descends before.\n\nThis is the Dao of governing the self.\n\nThus the sage engages in “non-action,”\nenacts the teaching of “non-words.”\nThe myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them,\ngives life yet does not possess,\nacts yet does not rely,\naccomplishes yet does not dwell.\nOnly by not dwelling does he not depart.\n\nThis continues the above discussion of governing the self.\nThe sage’s governance of the self is the work of non-action.\nThe sage’s teaching of the self is the teaching of non-words.\nEngaging in it to seek his will,\nacting to attain his heart’s intent.\nThe myriad things arise in multitude, looking to him,\nawaiting the sage’s ordering—\nyet the sage does not refuse.\n\nHow could he merely not refuse?\nHe has the merit of giving life to the people,\nyet the sage does not consider it his possession.\nHe has the merit of governing,\nyet the sage does not rely on it.\nWhen great works are accomplished,\nhe retires to rest—\nlike the Yellow Emperor visiting Dao on Mount Kongtong,\nlike Emperor Shun wearying of toil and ascending his throne.\nLater generations’ heroes and worthies,\naccomplishing great deeds and boldly retiring—\nall do not dwell.\n\nNot dwelling means not clinging.\nOnly by not clinging to merit\ndoes one again seek the Dao of governing the self.\nGuarding the self without departure,\none becomes a perfected person.\nGoverning the self can govern the world;\nperfecting oneself can perfect others—\nthus it is.\n\nWho says Laozi’s Dao entirely upholds quiescence and extinction?\n\n**Chapter Three**\n(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Pacifying the People” chapter; Peng’s edition calls it the “Non-Action” chapter.)\n\nNot exalting worthies prevents the people from contending;\nnot prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing;\nnot displaying what may be desired keeps the heart from disorder.\nThus the sage’s governance:\nempties their minds,\nfills their bellies,\nweakens their ambitions,\nstrengthens their bones.\nEver keeping the people without knowledge, without desire—\nso that those with knowledge dare not act.\nActing through non-action,\nthen nothing remains ungoverned.\n\nThe closing passage of the previous chapter spoke of the sage governing the world, accomplishing merit yet not dwelling in it, returning to seek the Dao of governing the self. Yet even in the sage’s governance of the world, this Way of governing operates not by exalting worthiness and ability to compete with the people—thus the mind for fame is already dimmed, and the people do not contend. Not prizing goods and wealth to vie with the people—thus the mind for profit is already severed, and the people do not steal. Not displaying what may be desired and desiring it—thus the mind for desire is already eliminated. The people’s hearts, being thus, are not disordered; the sage’s heart, being thus, is also not disordered. The excellence of governing the world all stems from the excellence of governing the self. Thus the sage’s governance of the self, though non-action, leaves nothing ungoverned.\n\nFame, profit, and desire all absent,\none guards the center to empty the mind.\nFame, profit, and desire all purified,\none nurtures qi to fill the belly.\nMoreover, the will and qi harmonious and gentle,\nweakness is employed;\nthe bones’ texture firm and unyielding,\nstrength is embodied.\nThus one’s self remains tranquil and indifferent,\nat peace with the world in non-affair.\nTherefore the people, too, are without knowledge, without desire,\nembracing their pristine simplicity—\nso that those with wisdom in the world cannot act,\nnor dare to act.\nSuch is the sage’s governance through non-action.\n\n**Chapter Four**\n(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “No Source” chapter.)\n\nThe Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted.\nProfound indeed, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.\nIt blunts their sharpness, unties their tangles,\nsoftens their glare, merges with their dust.\nDeep and still, it seems ever present.\nI know not whose child it is—\nit appears before the image of the Lord.\n\nThe sage’s Way of non-action lies entirely in emptiness and its application.\n*Chong* means emptiness.\nThe Dao employs emptiness as its function;\nits capacity embraces heaven and earth, the state and the family,\nyet never appears full—\nabysmally it resembles the primal ancestor of the myriad things.\nIt blunts the world’s sharpness without harm,\nuntangles the world’s knots without labor,\nfor its emptiness dissolves sharpness and entanglement.\nIt harmonizes the world’s brilliance without obscuring,\nmerges with the world’s dust without defilement,\nfor its emptiness forgets brilliance and dust.\nOnly its empty essence is perceived,\nconstantly abiding in its tranquil nature—\nseeming to exist, yet truly without existence.\nAsk whose child it is, and none can say;\nits name appears before the image of Heaven’s Lord.\nThis is what is called the beginning without beginning,\nthe first of the first, the heaven before Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Five**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Emptiness in Use” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Guarding the Center” chapter.)*\n\nHeaven and earth are not benevolent—\nthey treat the myriad things as straw dogs.\nHeaven and earth have no intention of benevolence;\nthey merely meet the needs of the myriad things.\nAnd the myriad things each fulfill their own needs,\neach serve their own use.\nThis non-benevolence is in truth the utmost benevolence.\nIf they waited to be benevolent before nurturing life,\nthen every single thing would require heaven and earth to bestow favor in order to live—\nthis would inevitably lead to insufficiency.\nOnly by not providing beasts with their straw\ndo beasts eat straw on their own.\nOnly by not feeding dogs for men\ndo men feed dogs on their own.\nThus the measure of benevolence becomes even more vast.\nStraw dogs are mentioned,\nyet fruits, vegetables, fowl, and swine can be inferred.\n\nThe sage is not benevolent—\nhe treats the hundred clans as straw dogs.\nThe sage, in harmony with heaven and earth,\nalso allows the hundred clans to each fulfill their own nurturance,\neach nurture themselves—\nthis is what is called “accomplishing through non-action.”\n\nBetween heaven and earth,\nis it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet inexhaustible,\nthe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion—\nbetter to guard the center.\n\nHeaven and earth, the sage,\ndo not create sustenance for the myriad things or the hundred clans,\nyet the myriad things and the hundred clans naturally obtain their sustenance.\nThis is due to the body of emptiness at the center,\nits capacity for universal nurturance.\nHeaven and earth are divided into two realms,\nand between these two realms lies a vast emptiness—\nlike a bellows without a bottom, a flute with open passages.\nQi flows back and forth, acting without contrivance,\nthus emptiness can contain all things without exhaustion.\nIts center holds all, moving silently,\never expanding its full capacity—\ninexhaustible within.\nHeaven and earth do not speak,\nnor does the sage.\nIf they spoke excessively,\nwords would have limits,\nand limits could be exhausted.\nThus it is better to guard the center alone.\n\n**Chapter Six**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Forming Images” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Valley Spirit” chapter.)*\n\nThe valley spirit does not die—\nthis is called the mysterious female.\nThe gate of the mysterious female\nis called the root of heaven and earth.\nSubtly continuous, it seems to exist;\nits use is never exhausted.\n\nThe sage guards the center to govern the self,\nfor the center has the power to nourish the valley spirit.\nThe valley spirit is the original nature.\n*Gu* (valley) suggests emptiness;\n*shen* (spirit) suggests numinosity.\nWhen the nature’s body is empty and numinous, it is not obscured.\nNot obscured means it does not die.\nYet why is the valley spirit also called the mysterious female?\n*Xuan* (mysterious) refers to heaven;\n*pin* (female) refers to earth.\nWhen heaven and earth unite, the mysterious female is formed—\nwithin it lies a vast emptiness.\nConfucians call it the subtle and hidden,\na realm of neither seeing nor hearing.\nBuddhists name it *that*—\na truth beyond good and evil.\nThe sage governs the self\nby borrowing the empty mysterious female\nto nurture the empty and numinous valley spirit.\nThus the valley spirit’s name is given to the mysterious female—\nthis is naming according to function.\nOne *xuan*, one *pin*—\none *qian*, one *kun*.\nConfucius said: “Are *qian* and *kun* not the gates of the *Yi*?”\nThe *Cantong Qi* states: “*Qian* and *kun* are the gates of the *Yi*.”\nThe so-called “two apertures method,”\nwhere metal and qi mutually assist,\nis precisely this gate of the mysterious female.\nYin and yang come and go within it;\n*kan* and *li* unite within it.\nIt is the chamber where male and female unite,\nthe place where the sun and moon exchange light.\nThe sage inverts it to make it the gate of life;\nordinary people use it in sequence, making it the door of death.\nThe union of earth and heaven is no other than this.\nThus it is also called the root of heaven and earth—\nthe root where heaven and earth mutually reside.\nThe root of heaven and earth\nis the place of returning to the origin and reverting to the primordial,\nthe realm of refining qi and transforming spirit.\n“Subtly continuous, it seems to exist”—\nthis is the cultivation of the valley spirit,\nnatural fetal breathing.\n“Its use is never exhausted”—\nthis is the external furnace’s regulation,\nnatural alignment with the fire.\n“Not exhausted” means not labored.\n\n**Chapter Seven**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the “Concealing Brilliance” chapter; Peng’s version titles it the “Selflessness” chapter.)*\n\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring.\nThe reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring\nis that they do not live for themselves—\nthus they can live long.\nTherefore the sage places himself last and finds himself first,\nsets himself aside and finds himself preserved.\nIs this not because he is without self-interest?\nThus he can achieve his self-interest.\n\nHeaven is eternal, earth enduring—\nthis is the Way of long life.\nYet the reason heaven and earth can be eternal and enduring\nis that they are still when closing, active when opening,\nstill when gathering, active when dispersing,\ngenerating life abundantly,\ncovering and bearing all without self-interest—\nonly then do they attain this long life.\nIf heaven and earth were self-interested in their life,\nthe lives of things would not flourish,\nand heaven and earth would harm their harmony.\nThe natures of things would not be upright,\nand heaven and earth would damage their centers.\nThe harm to the myriad things\nis the harm to heaven and earth.\nOnly by not being self-interested in their life,\nbut taking the lives of all beings as their own life.\n\nThe ceaseless generation of all beings *is* the long life of heaven and earth—thus they attain long life. The sage emulates heaven and earth. Therefore, in nurturing life, the sage is yielding and weak, seemingly placing the self last to seek life. Yet by gradual filling and fulfillment, in truth he places the self first to obtain life. By guarding the center to control the exterior, he seems to cast life aside as if without life. Yet by first forgetting and later preserving, he preserves his life to possess life. All this arises from not privately possessing the Way. Thus the sage’s tranquility and simplicity restore the people’s nature to purity and goodness. The sage’s longevity brings the people’s lives to fullness and longevity. The great Way is without self-interest—yet in this, the sage appears to possess life for himself. The absence of self-interest becomes his self-interest—this is the ultimate.\n\n**Chapter Eight**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the \"Transforming Nature\" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the \"Supreme Virtue\" chapter)*\n\nThe supreme virtue is like water.\nWater benefits the myriad things without contention,\ndwelling in places others disdain—\nthus it nearly approaches the Way.\nIn dwelling, it is good at lowliness;\nin heart, it is good at depth;\nin association, it is good at kindness;\nin speech, it is good at trust;\nin governance, it is good at order;\nin affairs, it is good at ability;\nin action, it is good at timing.\nOnly by not contending does it avoid blame.\n\nThe Way values humility—\nby descending, it ascends—\nhence it is called \"supreme virtue.\"\nThis supreme virtue is compared in power to water.\nWater’s goodness lies in benefiting the life of all things,\nmaking them all sufficient without contention.\nYet water’s nature flows downward,\noften dwelling where others disdain.\nThough people may despise it,\nultimately water suffers no harm.\nIt benefits others without claiming merit,\ntaking weakness as its aspiration—\nthus water nearly approaches the Way.\n\nThe goodness of human nature should resemble water’s goodness.\nHolding to a humble nature,\nall actions become good.\nWithout a contentious heart,\none chooses dwelling in good places,\nconceals the heart in good depth,\nassociates with good kindness,\ndelights in good trust,\ngoverns with good order,\nhandles affairs with good ability,\nand acts in good timing.\nIn every place and circumstance,\none is yielding, good, and non-contending.\nOnly by not contending does one avoid resentment and blame.\nCompared to water, which others may still despise,\nhumans can descend yet ascend—\nthus they surpass the Way in subtlety,\ntranscending even water in spirit.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the \"Moving the Unyielding\" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the \"Holding Fullness\" chapter)*\n\nTo hold and fill it—\nknow when to stop.\nTo shape and sharpen it—\nit cannot be long preserved.\nWhen gold and jade fill the hall,\nnone can guard them.\nWhen wealth and nobility breed arrogance,\none invites one’s own misfortune.\n\n*To hold*: to obtain.\n*To shape*: to probe.\nOnce one has obtained qi,\nto harbor the desire for fullness\nis the beginning of loss—\nthus it is better to stop.\nWhen one probes one’s treasures\nand suddenly harbors a keen, sharp intent,\nthis is the omen of certain decline—\nthus it cannot be long preserved.\nIf one should stop yet does not,\nis it not like gold and jade filling the hall,\nwhich none can guard?\nIf one should preserve yet does not,\nis it not like wealth and nobility breeding arrogance,\ninviting one’s own misfortune?\n\nThis is the way of humans.\nTo withdraw when achievements are complete and fame is attained—\nthis is the Way of heaven.\n\nMoreover, consider the Way of heaven:\nHeaven does not speak of achievement or fame,\nyet takes the flourishing of generation and growth as its achievement and fame.\nWhen things mature and their time comes,\nheaven and earth withdraw and shift.\nConcealing themselves in winter’s season,\nthey nurture the yang life to come.\nWhat does humanity observe in the Way of heaven?\n\n**Chapter Ten**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this the \"Ability\" chapter; Peng’s version titles it the \"Mysterious Virtue\" chapter)*\n\nCan you carry your *po* and embrace the One without separation?\nCan you concentrate your *qi* to attain softness, like an infant?\nCan you cleanse and purify your mysterious mirror without flaw?\nCan you love the people and govern the state without action?\nCan you open and close the gates of heaven without the feminine?\nCan you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?\n\nTo generate and nurture,\nto generate without possessing,\nto act without relying,\nto lead without dominating—\nthis is called mysterious virtue.\n\n*To carry*: as a cart carries a load.\n*Nourishing*: as in the *ying* and *wei* [nutritive and defensive qi].\n*Wei* pertains to yang, while *ying* pertains to yin.\n*Ying-po*: the yin *po* [corporeal soul].\nSome say *ying* is *po*—\nto take *ying* as *po* is a mistaken interpretation.\nOne must understand that when speaking of the yin *po*,\nthe yang *hun* [ethereal soul] is already within it.\nOn the fifteenth day of the eighth month,\nthe *hun* fully infuses the moon’s *po*,\nand the moon becomes full, purely yang.\nThe sage, at this moment,\nemploys the river chariot to carry it,\nand the yang metal becomes his own—\nas the scripture says, “Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.”\nHaving obtained the One,\none will not lose the One.\nThe sage carries the *po* and returns,\nembracing the One to dwell—\nthus the earth’s *po* captures the cinnabar mercury.\nTherefore, can one not separate from it?\n\nIn the tenth month, warm cultivation—\nthe inner fire is natural.\nWith warmth constantly present,\nthe infant embryo grows.\nThe sage concentrates *qi* to attain softness—\nthis is the inner fire.\nThus can one be like a nurtured infant.\n\n*Mysterious vision* is inner observation.\nTo cleanse and purify the mysterious mirror\nis to observe inwardly in clarity and stillness.\nInward observation in clarity and stillness\nleaves the heart without flaw or burden—\nthis is what is meant by:\n“Observe emptiness as empty,\nand emptiness itself is empty.\nWhen the object of emptiness is gone,\neven ‘no emptiness’ is gone.\nWhen ‘no emptiness’ is gone,\nprofound stillness remains.”\n\nTo love the people is to pacify them;\nto govern the state is to enrich it.\nOnly when the people are at peace and the state is prosperous\ncan one practice governance without action.\nIn cultivating the self,\nstabilizing essence is pacifying the people,\nand sufficiency of lead is enriching the state.\nRefining the self stabilizes essence;\nreturning the elixir suffices the lead.\nOnly after refining the self and returning the elixir\ncan one practice the Way of embracing the One without action—\nit is the same.\n\nIn cultivating the self,\nguarding the feminine is the work.\nIn regulating spirit and nurturing the embryo,\none cannot but guard the feminine.\nYet when the gate of heaven is broken through\nand the yang spirit moves in and out freely,\nopening and closing at will—\ncan one then be without the toil of guarding the feminine?\n\nIn cultivating the self,\nknowledge is disturbance.\nWhen the sage’s body is perfected,\nthe spirit of knowledge transforms\ninto right enlightenment.\n\nSo clear and luminous that the four directions are unimpeded—can one then be without knowledge?\n\nMoreover, there is the further work of begetting the child and producing the heir, the exchange of the crucible and the division of the embryo. There is the capacity to accumulate blessings and virtue, to establish merit and aid the world. Yet though one begets, one does not possess that which is begotten—emptiness shatters into dust. Though one acts, one does not rely on that action—compassion is vast and boundless. The heart that protects the state and blesses the people persists for a thousand kalpas, ten thousand kalpas, ever thus, yet does not boast of heavenly dominion. This is truly called the mysterious virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Uselessness”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of Utility.”)*\n\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the cart.\nClay is kneaded to make a vessel;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the room.\nThus, what is present serves as advantage,\nwhile what is absent serves as use.\n\nThe thirty-six spokes of the wheel mirror the movements of the sun and moon. Yet the hub lies at the very center of the cart, through which all axles pass. Hollow within, with spokes converging without—thus the hub is fundamentally empty, yet therein lies the use of the cart.\n\n*Shan*: water mixed with earth.\n*Zhi*: sticky clay, the material of bricks and tiles.\nWhen clay is first shaped, there is no vessel. But once kneaded and fired, it becomes the use of a vessel. A room gains light through doors and windows; without them, it is as if there were no room. Once carved and adorned, it becomes the use of a room. Thus, what is present serves as advantage, while what is absent serves as use. Being arises from non-being—this is generally the case.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Restraining Desire”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of the Belly.”)*\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes;\nthe five tones deafen the ears;\nthe five flavors dull the palate;\nriding and hunting madden the heart;\nrare and precious goods corrupt conduct.\n\nTherefore, the sage attends to the belly, not the eyes—thus he discards the one and embraces the other.\n\n*Shuang*: loss.\n*Kuang*: recklessness.\nRarities and treasures are things all men contend for. Thus, carrying valuables invites harm even while traveling. The damage wrought by colors, sounds, flavors, hunting, and goods is such that the sage holds them in contempt. He guards his inner treasure and scorns external things—thus he discards the one and embraces the other.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Disdaining Shame”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of Honor and Nobility.”)*\n\nFavor and disgrace are like alarm;\nregard great calamity as you would your own body.\n\nFavor is like alarm—thus one must deeply conceal the jade.\nDisgrace is like alarm—thus one must firmly establish the root.\nThis is the image of a mind roused and a will striving.\n\nRegard the body as noble—thus one delights in the Dao and rests in glory.\nRegard calamity as the body—thus one harmonizes light and silences slander.\nThis is the method of embracing the origin and guarding the true.\n\nWhat is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm”?\nFavor is base—gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm. This is called “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\n\n“Favor is base” means that glory is ever shifting, always subject to decline—thus gain and loss cannot be relied upon. Gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm: whether gaining or losing, one remains vigilant and strives without cease. This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\n\nWhat is meant by “regard great calamity as you would your own body”?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body. Once I have no body, what calamity could I have?\n\nThus, one who values the body as the world can be entrusted with the world;\none who cherishes the body as the world can be entrusted with the world.\nThis passage expounds on valuing calamity, first clarifying that having calamity must lead to being without calamity.\n\nYet the cause of great calamity lies in the present form of the body—thus calamity may befall it. But once the shell is shed and the spirit preserved, calamity cannot touch it. Or if one remains in the world while concealing true qi within, veiling one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—what great calamity could disturb such a one?\n\nThus, one who esteems the body and regards it as the world’s entrusted charge, who does not dare to slight this body of a thousand gold pieces, can be entrusted with the world. This is the lesson Huang Shigong imparted to Zhang Liang. One who preserves the body and regards it as the world’s reliance, who does not reveal his rare and transcendent talents, can be entrusted with the world. This is the admonition Zhang Jiuling gave to the Earl of Ye.\n\nHe who excels at preserving the body excels at governing the self.\nHe who excels at governing the self excels at governing the world.\nConfucius said: “The hibernation of the dragon and snake is for the sake of preserving the body. Making use of things to secure the body is for the sake of exalting virtue.” The noble man conceals his talents within, awaiting the proper time to act—what disadvantage could there be?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Praising the Mysterious.”)*\n\nThe invisible is called \"even\"; the inaudible is called \"rare\"; the intangible is called \"subtle.\" These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, so they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—returning to nothingness, this is called the form without form, the image without image, the state of vagueness. Meeting it, one does not see its beginning; following it, one does not see its end. Holding to the ancient Dao, one governs the present being. To know the ancient origin is called the discipline of the Dao.\n\nThe realm of the unseen and unheard is the Gate of Rarity and Evenness. The Gate of Rarity and Evenness is where nature and emotions reside. Evenness conceals nature; rarity conceals emotion. Thus, it is unseen and unheard. Yet the true intent moves between them, intangible when grasped—hence named \"subtle.\" These three cannot be divided or exhaustively questioned, so they should be blended into one, allowing the three to meet. Above and below correspond to \"closing above and closing below.\" Neither bright nor dark, it is as if existing yet not existing. \"Vast and boundless\" means caution and reverence, like closing above and below, existing yet not existing. Cautious of what one does not perceive, its beginning and end cannot be named. Vague and indistinct, within it there is something—returning to nothingness. This is what is called the form without form, the image without image. Without form or image, this is the state of vagueness. The truth of vagueness has no beginning or end—is this not the primordial qi? The ancient Dao is the original substance. The present being is its current function. Though ancient and present differ, one may hold to the ancient to govern the present, from non-being to being. To know what precedes the primordial origin and extend it to what follows is called the discipline of the Dao. Recording years, months, days, hours, even a single tally or moment—all are disciplines of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Manifesting Virtue”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Preserving Fullness.”)*\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—too deep to be known. Precisely because they could not be known, one can only forcefully describe them: cautious as if crossing a river in winter, vigilant as if fearing neighbors on all sides, dignified as if a guest, yielding as if ice about to melt, simple as if uncarved wood, open as if a valley, merged as if turbid.\n\nWho can, within turbidity, wait for clarity through stillness? Who can, in tranquility, await life through prolonged movement? Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness. Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.\n\nFrom ancient cultivators, knowing this subtle and profoundly penetrating Way of governing the self—so deep it cannot be fathomed—they dared not recklessly seek to understand it. Even when describing it, they could only forcefully do so. The seven \"as if\" phrases in this chapter are all descriptive words. What they describe are scenes and images. Who can, within heavy turbidity, patiently await its light clarity? Who can, with tranquil and simple spirit, long await its gradual arising? Waiting and awaiting, one dares not seek excess. Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—this is not seeking excess. Only by not seeking excess can one uphold constancy. Not creating anew avoids contradicting the true Dao.\n\nWei Boyang said: *\"At the furnace, fix the weights precisely; five parts water are in excess. Taking these two as true, gold outweighs its original state. The third does not enter, and fire accompanies both.\"* This is the Way of not seeking excess and upholding constancy. Could Cloud Teeth Master’s *Triple Concordance* also embody the *Daodejing* of the Supreme One without creating anew?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Returning to the Root”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Emptiness and Stillness.”)*\n\nAttain utmost emptiness; guard deep stillness. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. All things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune. Knowing constancy brings acceptance; acceptance brings impartiality; impartiality brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven brings the Dao; the Dao brings enduring. To the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.\n\n\"Attain\" means to place. \"Emptiness\" is an empty vessel. \"Utmost\" means fulfilling its Way. \"Guard\" means to reside. \"Stillness\" is non-action. \"Deep\" means careful and unwavering. \"The myriad things arise together\" means all things have a beginning. \"I\" is the master of all things. \"Observe\" means to await. \"Return\" means to revert.\n\nThe cultivator places the primordial spirit within the empty vessel, thus obtaining its Way. Having obtained the Way, one should reside in a quiet, inactive place, carefully and unwaveringly preserving it. Awaiting the empty vessel’s generation of things, one then awaits their return to the root. Thus, going forth and returning, life transforms and spirit becomes luminous. Knowing this, the Way of seven returns is complete.\n\nThe myriad things flourish abundantly and arise together, moving from non-action to action, from action back to non-action, still able to follow the mechanism of transformation in their comings and goings. Thus, spring’s birth, summer’s flourishing, autumn’s gathering, winter’s storing—withering and falling, they return to their root. Things return to their root, moving and then still—hence called stillness. Stillness means returning to nothingness and reverting to creation—hence called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny, one knows the true constancy of the Way. Constancy in stillness can constantly respond. Serene, it becomes profoundly clear—hence knowing constancy is called illumination.\n\nPeople of the world, not knowing the true constancy of the Way lies in returning to the root and destiny, engage in reckless endeavors, sinking into the forms and names of action, depleting their spirit. Thus, reckless action brings misfortune.\n\nShould one not, then, know constancy? Knowing constancy, one attains capacity. Capacity: to contain the public. Public: greatness. Kingly: nobility. Heaven: reverence. The Dao: the ultimate of emptiness and nothingness. It is to say, containing one’s origin within stillness, one can thereby magnify creation and enter the realm of the most sagely and spiritual, returning to the truth of utmost emptiness and nothingness. Embodied in emptiness and nothingness, one endures unharmed. \"No body\": nothingness—with spirit but no form, water and fire cannot harm, metal and stone cannot destroy, tigers and rhinoceroses cannot devour, blades and weapons cannot sever. What peril could there be?\n\n**Chapter Seventeen** *(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Pure Wind Chapter\"; Peng’s version calls it \"The Supreme Chapter\")*\n\nThe supreme,\nThe people below merely know of its existence.\nThe supreme: the sage. The sage dwells above the multitude, hence called \"supreme.\" Some say \"supreme\" refers to the highest principle—this too is valid.\nThe sage engages in non-action;\nPractices the teaching without words;\nDoes not boast of ability, so the people do not contend;\nDoes not covet profit, so the people do not crave;\nDoes not indulge desire, so the people are not disordered.\nWithout contention, craving, or disorder, the supreme possesses these, and the people below possess them as well.\n\"Know of its existence\" refers to the people below.\n\nNext,\nThey draw near and praise him;\nNext,\nThey fear him;\nNext,\nThey revile him.\nWhen trust is insufficient, there will be distrust.\nThus, he values his words.\nWhen his work is accomplished and affairs are settled, the hundred clans all say, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\nThe next level is the successor to the Dao.\nThe supreme Dao accomplishes through non-action and governs without speech.\nThe next cannot practice non-action or refrain from speech, so they draw near with affection and praise to inspire transformation.\nYet the next, unable to inspire through affection and praise, must rely on laws and decrees to awe and subdue.\nAnd the next, unable to awe and subdue through laws, must employ cunning and artifice to control.\nWhen the Dao descends to cunning and artifice, the wind has already declined—what remains is not worth observing.\n\nThus, he returns to the root of trust in the heart.\nWhen the ruler values trust, the people dare not but respond with sincerity.\nWhen the ruler’s trust is sufficient, the people speak with true feeling.\nWhen trust is insufficient, the people will be untrustworthy.\nYet the sage must govern through trust.\nValuing words means speaking with caution.\nWhen the ruler personally practices substantive governance, moving with ease and inspiring trust, the people submit without proclamations—thus, he must be circumspect in his commands.\nWhen his work is accomplished and affairs are settled, the hundred clans, unaware and unknowing, follow the celestial pattern, all saying, \"We are naturally so.\"\n\n*My humble observation:* The meaning of this chapter can be applied to governing the world and to cultivating the self.\nThe highest virtue is cultivated through purity and stillness; the six senses are all settled, practicing non-action without contrivance.\nThe next is cultivated through love and reverence, moved to penetrate and connect, practicing non-action yet with contrivance.\nYet the next relies on legal discipline to control.\nAnd the next employs cunning and scrutiny—what is called \"artifice,\" the way of action with contrivance.\nNone surpasses trust in subtlety. Trust pertains to earth; in the elixir of golden cinnabar, from beginning to end, the wondrous function lies purely in the intent of earth—all is naturally so.\nProfound indeed are these words, applicable to governing the world and to cultivating the self.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen** *(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Shallow Customs Chapter\"; Peng’s version calls it \"The Great Dao Chapter\")*\n\nWhen the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and intelligence arise, there is great deceit.\nWhen the six relations are disharmonious, there is filial piety and compassion.\nWhen the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.\n\nHere the chapter speaks of the Way of governance—its flourishing and decay—yet it also reveals the principle of self-cultivation. Let us consider both aspects.\n\nFirst, the affairs of non-action give rise to policies of kindness and grace, just as the loss of the primal undifferentiated state gives rise to the work of return and restoration. When clarity and artifice are employed to scrutinize and seek, the feelings of the people become ever more deeply concealed—just as when cunning and mechanism are used to probe and extract, the medicinal substances grow ever more adept at mutual concealment.\n\nWithin the court, filial piety and compassion serve to harmonize the disharmony of the six relations, just as entering the chamber to cultivate serenity serves to still the restlessness of the six senses. When the state has loyal ministers, they serve to rescue it from benightedness and chaos—just as when the Mysterious Gate holds true gold, it serves to rescue from decline and exhaustion.\n\nThen it laments the pristine and unadorned governance of the ancient age, and the cultivation of the highest virtue through non-action—how distant its wind has become, how long it has been lost.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Return to Simplicity Chapter\"; Peng’s version calls it \"The Three Abandonments Chapter\")*\n\nAbandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold.\nAbandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.\nAbandon skill, discard profit, and there are no thieves or robbers.\nThese three, as mere ornament, are insufficient—thus they are made to belong to something greater.\n\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce selfishness, diminish desire.\n\n*Abandon* means \"great\" or \"ultimate.\"\nWhen ultimate sagacity does not employ wisdom, the wind is wholly honest and unadorned, and the people gain manifold benefit.\nWhen ultimate benevolence does not employ righteousness, customs become wholly harmonious, and the people return to filial piety and compassion.\nWhen ultimate skill does not scheme for profit—those who scheme for profit are all followers of cunning and mechanism—if the ruler is without cunning, the people are without thieves.\n\nSagacity is insufficient in wisdom, benevolence is insufficient in righteousness, skill is insufficient in profit.\nThese three—sagacity, benevolence, and skill—are like having substance without ornament.\nIn their primal, undifferentiated state, the Way is one and the wind is uniform; thus the people are each made to have their proper place, following nothing but their essential reality.\n\nManifest plainness, embrace simplicity,\nReduce selfishness, diminish desire—\nthe ornament of the people is also insufficient, yet it is beautiful.\n\n**Chapter Twenty**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Different Customs Chapter\"; Peng’s version calls it \"The Abandonment of Learning Chapter\")*\n\nAbandon learning, and there is no sorrow.\nBetween \"yes\" and \"ah,\" how great is the distance?\nBetween good and evil, what is the difference?\nWhat others fear must not be feared.\n\nTo abandon learning is to be complete in the Dao and replete in virtue.\nWhen the Dao and virtue are complete, what sorrow can there be?\nWhen the sage regards the multitude, it is as if \"yes\" is too direct and \"ah\" is too flattering.\nGood is lovable and evil is detestable, yet one does not know how far apart they truly are.\nThe sage has no sorrow, and thus no fear.\nWhat others fear is the difficulty of abandoning learning—\nhow can one fear what others fear and not seek to abandon learning?\nThus it is said: \"What must not be feared is fear itself.\"\n\nVast indeed, it has no end!\nThe multitude bustle and rejoice,\nas if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nas if ascending the springtime terrace.\nI alone am tranquil, without sign or omen,\nlike an infant who has not yet learned to smile;\nadrift, as if with no place to return.\nThe multitude all have more than enough,\nwhile I alone seem to have lost everything.\nI have the heart of a fool—how muddled!\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone am dim and dull.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull and obscure.\nVast, as if dark;\nstill, as if without place to abide.\nThe multitude all have their uses,\nwhile I alone am stubborn and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nand value feeding on the Mother.\n\nThe great Dao of prior Heaven is like the unopened state of primordial chaos—it accomplishes without action, governs without speech.\nThus the multitude all attain the transformation of simplicity and thickness, bustling in mutual peace and joy.\nThey share in the nourishment of its virtue, as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice.\nThey wander within its realm, as if ascending the springtime terrace.\nEven the customs of Huaxu cannot surpass this.\nThe sage says: I alone am bland and tranquil, utterly without sign or omen, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.\n*Adrift*—riding the Dao, thus it is called \"adrift.\"\nAscending and descending, circulating within—ceaselessly moving, as if with no place to return.\nThus the multitude all have ground to seek, while I alone, in this state, seem to have left the world and stand apart.\nThen the multitude are all wise, while I alone seem foolish—yet this is the great skill that appears clumsy.\nVast, like the darkness of heaven and earth; fleeting, like the boundless coming and going.\nFrom this perspective, the multitude all have their uses, while I alone am dim and dull, drifting like one foolish, stubborn, and coarse.\nOthers do not share my way, and I too differ from them.\nA single grain of yang elixir, called the Mother Qi—I alone seek and feed upon it to attain longevity.\nThat the multitude do not equal the sage is like the distance between \"yes\" and \"ah,\" between good and evil.\nIs this not why the sage alone proclaims the abandonment of learning?\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Empty Heart Chapter\"; Peng’s version calls it \"The Vast Virtue Chapter\")*\n\nThe bearing of vast virtue follows only the Dao.\nAs for the Dao as a thing—only vague, only indistinct.\nIndistinct, vague—within it there are images.\nVague, indistinct—within it there are things.\nDark, profound—within it there is essence.\nIts essence is utterly real, within it there is sincerity.\nFrom ancient times to the present, its name does not depart,\nthrough which it surveys the origins of the multitude.\nHow do I know the origins of the multitude are thus?\nBy this.\n\n*Vast* means \"empty\" or \"great.\"\nThe vessel of the most empty and greatest virtue can contain wondrous things, thus the great Dao enters therein.\nAs for the Dao as a thing—vague and indistinct, without fixed form.\nSpeaking of its departure from nature, it is originally without image.\nNow indistinct, now vague—what is without image seems to have image.\nNow vague, now indistinct—what is without thing has already become thing.\nSome say *indistinct, vague* rhymes with *image*.\n\n\"Vague and indistinct\" rhymes with \"thing.\"\nYet the sage in establishing words inverts the order of characters—this itself embodies the inversion of the Dao’s method.\n\"Indistinct, vague\" is the original image of nature.\n\"Vague, indistinct\" is the thing nature plants: with male below and female above, they unite to form essence—a single thing, yet truly two things conjoined.\nThus, in the upper phrase there is image; in the middle phrase, thing; in the lower phrase, essence.\nThe structure of the phrases again embodies the Dao’s method.\nEssence arises when the fire of nature descends to illuminate and evoke response, thereby revealing the hidden emotion of *Kan*. Yet it is subtle and profoundly unfathomable, hence called \"dark, profound.\"\nThe essence within this darkness is true essence.\nTo obtain true essence, one must know true sincerity.\nThus, within it there is first sincerity—vast as the surging tide, fluid as melting ice.\nThe cultivator, awaiting the first arrival of this sincerity, precisely when it is essence, must then subdue and seize it.\nWith not a moment’s delay, the golden immortal is within reach.\nIt is called true gold, the primary meridian, true water, spirit-water, true lead, lead-qi, white tiger, tiger-qi—yet it does not depart from true essence.\nTherefore, from ancient times to the present, the name of this true essence cannot be discarded by any scripture.\nThus, by observing the truth of this one thing, one surveys the principles of the myriad things—none but revere this primordial qi.\n\"Surveying the origins of the multitude\" means examining the beginnings of all things.\nHence it is also said: \"How do I know the origins of the multitude are thus?

To refine lead and obtain the elixir, one need not look beyond this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Chapter of Benefiting Through Humility\"; Peng’s version titles it \"The Chapter of Complete Return\")*\n\nTo yield is to be whole,\nto bend is to be straight,\nto be hollow is to be filled,\nto be worn is to be renewed,\nto have little is to gain,\nto have much is to be perplexed.\nTherefore the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for the world.\nNot displaying oneself, one is illuminated.\nNot asserting oneself, one is distinguished.\nNot boasting, one achieves merit.\nNot priding oneself, one endures.\nOnly by not contending does the world have nothing with which to contend against one.\nThe saying of the ancients, \"To yield is to be whole\"—was this empty talk?\nTruly, wholeness returns to it.\n\"To yield is to be whole\" means reduction becomes increase.\n\"To bend is to be straight\" means softness overcomes hardness.\n\"To be hollow is to be filled\" means humility receives benefit.\n\"To be worn is to be renewed\" means decay heralds return.\n\"To have little is to gain\" means knowing sufficiency avoids disgrace.\n\"To have much is to be perplexed\" means greed and desire lead to delusion.\nThese are the words of the ancients before the Most High, speaking of the essential Dao of cultivating the self.\nThus, when the sage governs the world, he must embrace the One as the model for all under heaven.\nTo embrace the One is to not display oneself, not assert oneself, not boast, not pride oneself.\nWang Bi’s commentary aligns these four phrases with \"To yield is to be whole,\" but this interpretation is misguided, for *illuminated*, *distinguished*, *enduring*, and *achieving merit* are intrinsic explanations of their respective phrases.\nSomeone asked: \"Why does the ancient saying again cite 'To yield is to be whole'?\"\nI reply: The Most High invokes the ancients’ words on cultivating the self to introduce the principles of the world, hence saying, \"Was this empty talk?\" If one can reverently guard sincerity in the One, then the world will surely return wholly to this model.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Chapter of Emptiness and Nothingness\"; Peng’s version titles it \"The Chapter of Spontaneity\")*\n\nRare words arise spontaneously.\nThus, whirlwinds do not last the morning,\nnor do torrential rains last the day.\nWho brings these about? Heaven and Earth.\nIf even Heaven and Earth cannot endure long,\nhow much less can man?\nTherefore, those who engage in the Dao:\nthe Dao-aligned merge with the Dao,\nthe virtue-aligned merge with virtue,\nthe lost merge with loss.\nThose who merge with the Dao—the Dao delights in obtaining them.\nThose who merge with virtue—virtue delights in obtaining them.\nThose who merge with loss—loss delights in obtaining them.\nWhen sincerity is insufficient, there will be those who do not trust.\n\"Rare words\" means no sound, and also no action.\nFor those who enter the Dao, non-action and spontaneity are the foundation.\nWith non-action, there is supreme tranquility; with spontaneity, there is constant progress.\nOtherwise, like whirlwinds and torrential rains—though brought about by Heaven and Earth—they cannot endure long.\nHow much less can man?\nThus, all who follow the path of the Dao, cultivating virtue and practicing the Way, must be spontaneous to unite with the Dao and virtue.\n\"Loss\" means non-action; acting through non-action naturally attains the affairs of non-action.\nThe Dao, virtue, and loss all delight in this spontaneity and non-action.\nWhen trust and conduct are insufficient, there must first be those who do not trust spontaneity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Chapter of Suffering and Grace\"; Peng’s version titles it \"The Chapter of Tiptoeing and Striding\")*\n\nOne who tiptoes cannot stand,\none who strides cannot walk.\nOne who displays himself is not illuminated,\none who asserts himself is not distinguished,\none who boasts achieves no merit,\none who prides himself does not endure.\nIn the Dao, these are called: \"leftover food, redundant conduct.\"\nSome beings detest them, thus those with the Dao do not dwell in them.\n\"Tiptoeing\" means gazing upward.\n\"Striding\" means rushing forward.\nTiptoeing raises the head and cannot stand long.\nStriding strains the feet and cannot walk long.\nDisplaying oneself, asserting oneself, priding oneself, boasting—all belong to those who do not trust spontaneity and ultimately achieve nothing.\nIn terms of the method of practicing the Dao, this is like eating too much or walking too far—one cannot cultivate.\nCompared to a dog, overfeeding causes illness.\nCompared to an ox, overwork causes exhaustion.\n\nThus it is said: some beings detest them—how much more so would humans? Therefore, those who embody the Dao do not dwell in such states.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this \"The Chapter of Primordial Image\"; Peng’s version, \"The Chapter of Primal Chaos\")*\n\nThere is a thing, chaotically formed, born before heaven and earth.\nSilent, oh! Empty, oh! Standing alone without alteration, circulating without exhaustion—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\nI do not know its name; I style it \"Dao,\" and by force name it \"Great.\"\nGreat means passing, passing means far-reaching, far-reaching means returning.\nThus the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great.\nWithin the realm, there are four greats, and the king occupies one of them.\nHumans emulate earth, earth emulates heaven, heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity.\n\nChaotically formed—unbroken, nameless.\nThe primordial qi of vast chaos, indistinct and without name.\nNameless, it is that which is born before heaven and earth.\nSilent: pure. Empty: void.\nStanding alone in the realm of purity and emptiness, unchanging in its true constancy—nothing but this chaotic formation.\nOne thing circulates, pervading the ten thousand things without peril—thus it may be called the Mother of all under heaven.\n\nSince the dawn of creation, the Ancestor of the Dao has known that before the primordial chaos, there existed this Mother-qi.\nHeaven, earth, humans, and the ten thousand things—all are gestated within the womb of this Mother-qi.\nWhen asked its name, not knowing, we first style it with the character *Dao*.\n*Dao* combines *shou* (head) and *chuo* (movement)—that which moves and generates before heaven and earth.\nForced to name it, we call it *Great*.\n*Great* combines *yi* (one) and *ren* (person)—that which emerges before the multitude of things.\nFrom this, through myriad ages, it has been called the Great Dao.\n\nGreat, it goes everywhere—above to Qian, below to Kun, passing and leaving you behind.\nPassing, it reaches everywhere—north to Kan, west to Dui, far and yet attaining.\nThis Dao, when exhausted, must return.\nPerhaps emerging from Zhen, aligning with Xun, manifesting in Li, completing in Gen.\nGreat indeed! The Dao, with heaven, earth, and the king, together form the four greats within the realm.\n\nWithout the Dao, heaven would not be known—heaven is great.\nWithout heaven, earth would not be covered—earth is great.\nWithout earth, the king would not be borne—the king is also great.\nThe king occupies one of them, standing foremost among the people.\nAs lord of humanity, the king does not depart from the human.\nHumans stand upon earth, thus emulate earth.\nEarth lies beneath heaven, thus emulates heaven.\nHeaven lies within the Dao, thus emulates the Dao.\nThe Dao attains its subtlety in spontaneity, thus emulates spontaneity.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this \"The Chapter of Weighty Virtue\"; Peng’s version, \"The Chapter of Weighty Stillness\")*\n\nWeight is the root of lightness; stillness is the ruler of restlessness.\nTherefore, the noble person travels all day without departing from the balance of weight and lightness.\nThough there be splendid sights, they dwell in serenity, transcending.\nHow could one who rules ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before the world?\nLightness loses ministers; restlessness loses the ruler.\n\nWeight is water; lightness is fire.\nFire is born within water—thus weight is the root of lightness.\nStillness is stability; restlessness is wisdom.\nWisdom arises from stability—thus stillness is the ruler of restlessness.\n\nObserve the noble person whose talent and virtue are equally weighty: though traveling all day, they do not depart from the balance of weight and lightness, seeking to apply it with ease.\nThough there be splendid sights, they dwell in serenity, transcending, not allowing splendor to disturb their stillness.\nAlas! The master of the Crimson Palace, honored as one who commands ten thousand chariots—how could they suddenly treat their person lightly before the world, forgetting all?\nThey wholly fail to uphold weight to nurture lightness, wholly fail to guard stillness to govern restlessness.\nI fear that a single impulse of lightness loses the true water within the worthy—fire then has no root.\nFire is born of water; water is fire’s function—thus it is called \"minister.\"\nA single impulse of restlessness loses the true stability within the heart—wisdom then has no ruler.\nWisdom arises from stability; stability is wisdom’s master—thus it is called \"ruler.\"\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven** *(Heshang Gong’s version titles this \"The Chapter of Skillful Application\"; Peng’s version, \"The Chapter of Essential Subtlety\")*\n\nThe skillful traveler leaves no wheel tracks,\nthe skillful speaker utters no flaw or blame,\nthe skillful reckoner needs no counting rods,\nthe skillful closer uses no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened,\nthe skillful binder ties no cord or knot yet cannot be undone.\n\nThus the sage is ever skillful in saving people—\ntherefore no one is abandoned.\nEver skillful in saving things—\ntherefore nothing is abandoned.\nThis is called inheriting clarity.\n\nTherefore the good person is the teacher of the ungood,\nthe ungood person is the resource of the good.\nIf one does not value one’s teacher,\nif one does not cherish one’s resource,\nthough wise, one is greatly deluded.\nThis is called essential subtlety.\n\n\"Leaves no wheel tracks\"—the natural river chariot;\nif there were tracks, it would be forced visualization and transference.\n\"Utters no flaw or blame\"—the natural ancestral transmission;\nif there were flaws, it would violate the宗旨.\n\"Needs no counting rods\"—the natural fire timing;\nusing rods would be rigid adherence to hexagrams and strategies.\n\"Cannot be opened\"—the natural inner restraint;\nif it could be opened, it would be mere pretense of closure to the senses.\n\"Cannot be undone\"—the natural coagulation;\nif it could be undone, it would be forced aggregation.\n\nThus the sage abides in the constant goodness of the natural,\nestablishing oneself and establishing others—\nall people may be esteemed.\nPerfecting oneself and perfecting things—\nall things may be contemplated.\n\nInheriting illumination means using prior awakening to awaken later awakening, with the heart transmitting in succession to arouse enlightenment—this is what is called inheriting illumination. Thus the good person fully illuminates the luminous virtue; even the unvirtuous person, by drawing near, also partakes of luminous virtue. The unvirtuous person, unaware of self-reflection, is seen by the good person, who then reflects inwardly. They alternately take each other as teachers, alternately rely on each other. If one does not regard mutual reliance and mutual teaching as precious and beloved, then self-proclaimed cleverness, though possessing wisdom, is still like profound delusion. The essential subtlety of self-cultivation lies nowhere beyond this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Returning to Simplicity\"; Peng’s version titles it \"Constant Virtue\")*\n\n\"Know the masculine, guard the feminine,\nand become the world’s stream.\"\nBecoming the world’s stream,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nThis passage holds two meanings, both of which cultivators of the body should know and uphold.\n\nFirst: the masculine emits, the feminine transforms.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states:\n\"The masculine yang spreads its dark emanation,\nthe feminine yin governs the yellow transformation.\"\nKnowing this, one can emit and act;\nguarding this, one can transform and nurture.\nWhen feminine and masculine interact,\nmetal is concealed within water,\nand in turn water generates its metal.\nWhen the metal qi is sufficient, the tidal signal arrives—\nits force like a canal stream.\nFlowing backward and ascending,\nit becomes the world’s canal stream.\nYet though it is a canal stream,\nwith yang fire advancing and yin tally arriving,\nthe constant virtue of returning to the root and reviving life cannot be abandoned.\nThus it returns to the earthen cauldron to nurture the fetal infant.\n\nSecond: the masculine returns, the feminine conceals.\nAs the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"Within the masculine, the feminine nurtures the sacred embryo.\"\nIf discussing the principle of generating things,\nwhen yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—\nthis is the feminine harboring the masculine.\nIf discussing the practice of nurturing things,\nwhen yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—\nthis is the masculine harboring the feminine.\nWhen the masculine harbors the feminine,\nhaving obtained the masculine’s return to conjoin the elixir,\none must further rely on the feminine’s concealment to warm the elixir.\nIts force is like a ravine—\nflowing from above downward,\ndescending into the stream.\nThus the way of guarding the feminine\nis like the world’s ravines,\npossessing flow and return.\nThis is the true, constant primordial virtue,\nwhich cannot depart from its place.\nReturning to the stream\nis like returning to the Yellow Court.\nReturning to the state of infancy\nmeans entering stillness to nurture the sacred embryo.\n\n\"Know the white, guard the black,\nand become the world’s model.\"\nBecoming the world’s model,\nconstant virtue knows no error,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nHere the sage exhausts the principles of feminine and masculine\nand reveals their subtleties,\nagain borrowing color imagery to discuss them.\nThe white is metal essence;\nthe black is water’s foundation.\nMetal essence is the masculine yang,\nspread into the feminine to generate it.\nBefore this essence existed,\nthe Kun mother’s body was originally empty.\nThrough exchanging radiance with the Qian father,\nKun became replete and formed Kan.\nOnce the Kan form was complete,\nthe moon emitted the Dui trigram—\nthis is called metal within water.\nMetal within water\ntruly relies on the Kun mother’s nurturance to form,\nhence it is called the mother qi.\nAs the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"Extracting the white from the black makes the elixir mother.\"\nThe mother qi possesses white light,\ncalled yang light.\nWhen yang light appears,\none moves one’s own mercury to welcome it—\nthis is the \"second phase of seeking the medicine.\"\nWhen both correspond,\nthe two eights of the same kind,\ncaptured in one moment,\nrefined into yang elixir—\nthis is the elixir mother.\nYet its transformation occurs externally,\nso the elixir mother counts only as external medicine.\nThe practitioner uses external medicine to cultivate internal medicine,\nusing mother qi to subdue child qi.\nWithin the elixir mother,\nyang lead is produced—\none then harnesses the river chariot to transport it,\nreversing its course back to the original palace,\nconcealing it in the earthen cauldron.\nWith the four phases harmonized\nand the three families in joyous union,\nthis moment of bliss attains immortality.\nThough the method’s workings are thus,\nknowing the white must first involve guarding the black;\nguarding the black enables knowing the white;\nknowing the white still requires guarding the black.\nWithin this lie three layers of marvelous function,\nsufficient to serve as the world’s model.\nIf one can practice accordingly,\nthen natural constant virtue will know no error.\nHaving no error,\none can return to verify the boundless\nand refine spirit to return to emptiness.\n\nKnowing the white must involve guarding the black:\nyang enters within yin.\nGuarding the black enables knowing the white:\nyin produces yang within.\nKnowing the white still requires guarding the black:\nspirit returns and qi conceals.\nThe principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things\nare all thus.\nHence it serves as the world’s model.\n\n\"Know glory, guard disgrace,\nand become the world’s valley.\"\nBecoming the world’s valley,\nconstant virtue is thus fulfilled,\nreturning to simplicity.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs them,\nthen becomes an official or leader—\nthus great governance does not sever.\n\nFollowing the world to become human is a glorious matter.\nReversing the course to become immortal is a disgraceful matter.\nYet one should know the glory of becoming human\nand guard the disgrace of becoming immortal.\nThe study of constant disgrace is the study of cessation.\nEmptying the heart and nurturing qi,\none becomes like the world’s empty valley.\nAble to contend for the world’s empty valley,\nthen the constant virtue of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness\nis thus fulfilled.\nWith constant virtue fulfilled,\none returns to verify primordial simplicity\nand reverts to the root to return to the origin.\nThe true essence of primordial simplicity,\nscattered and seen, generates the myriad things.\nThe flourishing abundance\ncan all have their materials taken and fashioned into vessels.\nIf the sage wishes to employ these vessels,\nthey become officials of yin and yang,\nleaders of the multitudes,\npreserving and uniting them to return to the One.\nThus great governance of the world\ndoes not esteem division.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Non-Action\"; Peng’s version titles it \"The Sacred Vessel\")*\n\n\"Those who would take the world and act upon it,\nI see that they will not succeed.\nThe world is a sacred vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nThose who act upon it ruin it;\nthose who grasp it lose it.\"\n\nAll things either lead or follow,\neither warm with harmony or chill with force,\neither grow strong or weaken,\neither rise or fall.\nTherefore the sage discards excess,\ndiscards extravagance,\ndiscards excessiveness.\n\nThe world is like the body within.\nThe sacred vessel speaks of its utmost weight.\nThe Great Dao of prior Heaven\naccomplishes through natural non-action.\nVulgar people often doubt its emptiness and stillness,\nso the Old Master declares this to instruct them:\n\"Do people take non-action for emptiness and stillness?\nIf I were to take the world and govern it with action,\nI would see that those who act only multiply disturbances,\nonly multiply contrivances,\nachieving nothing without ceaseless toil.\"\n\nThe world’s sacred vessel is of utmost weight—\nwith action and many affairs,\nit is not like non-action with few affairs.\nThus it cannot be acted upon.\nActing to seek completion only brings ruin—\nto act is to ruin it.\nGrasping to seek attainment only brings loss—\nto grasp is to lose it.\n\nThe world is thus;\nall things are likewise.\nWhat dwells within the body:\nsome yang advances alone,\nsome yin arrives to follow,\nsome converges in warmth,\nsome drifts in cool breath,\nsome qi is full and robust,\nsome qi is tender and frail,\nsome ascends in bearing,\nsome descends in collapse—\nall is naturally so.\n\nTherefore the sage who practices the Dao\ndiscards excess,\ndiscards extravagance,\ndiscards excessiveness.\nThese three are all afflictions of fondness for action,\nso they are discarded.\n\n**Chapter Thirty**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Frugality in Warfare\"; Peng’s version titles it \"Military Strength\")*\n\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao\ndoes not rely on military strength to dominate the world,\nfor such affairs readily rebound.\nWhere armies encamp,\nthorns and brambles arise.\nIn the wake of great armies,\nyears of famine inevitably follow.\n\nThus the adept achieves results and nothing more—\ndaring not seize strength through force.\nHaving achieved results, do not boast;\nhaving achieved results, do not brag;\nhaving achieved results, do not grow arrogant;\nhaving achieved results, act only out of necessity;\nhaving achieved results, do not force it.\nFor when things reach their prime, they age—\nthis is called \"not the Dao,\"\nand what is not the Dao ends early.\n\nA ruler who strengthens virtue does not strengthen arms.\nOne who assists a ruler with the Dao—\nhow could they flaunt military might before the world?\nYet some deploy troops to vaunt their martial prowess,\nwhile others withdraw their forces to cultivate civil virtue.\nWorldly affairs often rebound in this way.\nWherever armies march, thorns and brambles spring up,\na sorrowful reminder of wounds and piercing harm.\nAfter the passage of troops, famine arises,\na bitter legacy of war’s lingering poison.\nHow can warfare be spoken of lightly?\n\nThe ancients who excelled in arms\nrooted out treachery, curbed violence,\neliminated bandits, and pacified the people.\nTheir banners lined the roads,\nseen as welcome as sweet rain.\nThey achieved results solely to rescue the distressed—\nnot to assert strength.\nYet even in achieving results,\none must eradicate boasting, bragging, and arrogance.\nBoasting breeds the impulse for war;\nbragging fosters the ambition for endless conquest;\narrogance nurtures the desire to flaunt force.\nThough results are achieved, no good intent remains.\nIf good intent guides the results,\nand the people’s suffering persists,\nthen great armies will persist as well.\nThe aim lies in strenuously rescuing them from hardship—\nnot in displaying strength.\n\nShould the enemy’s vigor not wane,\nand fortifications stand firm in stalemate,\na strong army will inevitably age—\nthis too is to ravage one’s own forces.\nTo ravage one’s own forces\nwhile seeking to punish those who act against the Dao\nis to act against the Dao oneself.\nPunishing those who act against the Dao\nonly to become what one seeks to destroy—\nbetter to garrison fields, defend the borders,\nand rest one’s troops.\nHave those who crave strength ever observed things?\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\none may well imagine that strength must decline.\nTo use things while exhausting them\nis to act contrary to the Dao.\nActing contrary to the Dao,\nbetter to end early.\n\nThis chapter exhaustively expounds the gains and losses of deploying troops,\nyet the marvel of the Dao turns on a single word: *thing*.\nAll action and endeavor arise from the decline of essence and the dissipation of qi,\nnecessitating restorative and guiding efforts—\nthis too is achieving results.\nWhether building the foundation for a hundred days\nor refining the self for three years,\nit is still achieving results.\nOr if the elixir foundation remains unlaid\nand one’s inherent nature remains obscured,\none may rebuild and refine again—\nthis too is achieving results.\nYet do not boast of results as strength,\nfor relentless fullness invites exhaustion.\nWhen the great medicine is near,\ndelay renders it useless.\nThus it is said: when things reach their prime, they age—\nbetter to end early.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Laying Down Arms\";\nPeng’s version titles it \"Fine Weapons\")*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\n\nFine weapons are instruments of ill omen—some things abhor them, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in their presence. Therefore, the noble person in repose values the left, but in warfare values the right. Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not tools for the noble person. When their use is unavoidable, tranquility is paramount. To triumph yet not glorify it—those who glorify it delight in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. For this reason, the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—positioned as in mourning rites. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites.\n\nThe term *fine* (佳) implies auspiciousness, yet fine weapons are called inauspicious—how then can weapons be esteemed? The harm of warfare is abhorred by all things, for its schemes are endless and its disturbances manifold. How could one who embodies the Dao claim the name of a lover of war? Thus, the noble person in the world, when at peace, values the left—for the left is auspicious. In warfare, they value the right—for the right is inauspicious. This further reveals the ill omen of weapons.\n\nWeapons are not the tools of the noble person, yet when their use is unavoidable, rescuing the distressed is paramount. Do not act with impatience or fervor; remain serene and detached. Even if victory is achieved and triumphant return secured, never regard warfare as a glorious affair. Those who do so must delight in slaughter. How could such a person be allowed to realize their ambitions in court or wage war across the land?\n\nObserving human affairs, one cannot but sigh: auspicious affairs honor the left, inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left pertains to yang and life, the right to yin and death. Thus, in the military, there are supreme generals and deputy generals. The deputy general, without the supreme general’s command, dares not attack or kill—hence their position on the left, which holds the intent of life. The supreme general, bearing the intent of death, stands on the right. The right is the place of mourning rites, and nothing under heaven is more inauspicious. Thus, the supreme general is positioned as in mourning, cautioned against reckless killing.\n\nAlas! A single general’s success is built upon countless bones—such a thing is cause for bitter weeping. Therefore, when the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites. The heart of the highest sage is the heart of heaven and earth, which cherishes life.\n\n*(This chapter’s metaphor suggests that the \"female crucible\" is inauspicious and should not be employed. Yet its critique of warfare’s harms is profoundly incisive.)*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless and uncarved. Though small, none under heaven dare subjugate it. If lords and kings can guard it, the ten thousand things will naturally submit. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends—no command is given, yet it falls evenly of itself.\n\nOnce names are established, they too must know their limit; knowing the limit is how one avoids peril. The Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.\n\nThe great Dao is without name or form, a single mass of undifferentiated simplicity. Like the Limitless, though the uncarved block is small, it resides above the Supreme Ultimate—how could it be controlled or diminished? If lords and kings guard this simplicity, the great system remains unsevered, and the ten thousand things come as guests.\n\nWhen earth rises to heaven, heaven and earth harmonize, and sweet dew descends. No effort is required to achieve balance—spirit and qi naturally attain equilibrium. When qi transforms into liquid, it is first called the \"golden liquid returning elixir.\" Once the name \"golden liquid\" is established, it must be halted at the earthen crucible and nurtured. Knowing the limit avoids peril; embracing oneness and emptying the heart, peace naturally prevails.\n\nThis Dao, extended to the world, is like valleys to rivers and seas—it has its place of return.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is clarity.\nTo overcome others is to have strength;\nto overcome oneself is to be mighty.\nTo know contentment is wealth.\nTo act with perseverance is to have resolve.\nTo not lose one’s place is to endure.\nTo die yet not perish is to attain longevity.\n\nOne who understands others possesses wondrous wisdom;\none who understands their original nature attains perfect clarity—\nfor they have comprehended their inherent nature.\nOne who overcomes the desires of others has steadfast power;\none who overcomes the corpse-thief within possesses true might—\nfor they have comprehended their destiny.\nTo know contentment is to guard wealth and halt the fire to nurture the elixir.\nTo act with perseverance is to have resolve, like facing the wall for nine years.\nTo attain once is to attain forever, enduring as long as the earth.\nTo die in heart yet preserve the spirit is to live as long as heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Task of Completion\";\nPeng’s version titles it \"The Flow of Achievement\")*\n\nThe great Dao flows boundlessly, extending left and right.\nThe ten thousand things rely on it to live, yet it does not refuse;\nits work complete, it claims no possession.\nIt clothes and covers the ten thousand things yet does not act as their master—\never without desire, it may be called \"the small.\"\nThe ten thousand things return to it yet it does not act as their master—\nit may be called \"the great.\"\nThus the sage never deems himself great,\nand so accomplishes his greatness.\n\nVast and without limit, it meets all needs wherever they arise,\nallowing each to draw from it as they will.\nThe ten thousand things depend on the Dao for life, yet the Dao does not refuse,\nmerely following its timely course—\nits work complete, it claims no name.\nClothing and covering without acting as master,\nits virtue of nurturing and completion is all-pervading.\nRooted in non-action, none can name it as master.\nAbiding in true constancy and free from desire,\nits smallness cannot be broken—thus it may be called \"the small.\"\nEncompassing all returns yet not acting as master,\nits greatness cannot be borne—thus it may be called \"the great.\"\nOnly the sage does not display his greatness,\nand this is why he is truly great.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Chapter of Benevolent Virtue\")*\n\nHold to the great image, and all under heaven will come.\nThey come without harm, dwelling in peace and tranquility.\nMusic and fine food may make the passing traveler stop,\nbut the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor—\nseen, it cannot be perceived; heard, it cannot be listened to;\nused, it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe great image is that which has no image yet embodies all images—\nthus it is called the great image, still referring to the great Dao.\nOne who upholds the great Dao will have all under heaven come to him.\nMoving within his realm, serene and untroubled,\nthey suffer no harm, resting only in peace and tranquility.\nFine music and delicacies may make a passing traveler halt his carriage,\nseeking a moment’s delight—\nyet when the wine is finished and the songs end, they do not stay long.\nThe Dao is not so:\nspoken, it moistens and nourishes, though it seems bland and flavorless.\nWho knows that it transcends sight and sound?\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter 36** *(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this \"Subtle Illumination\")*\n\nTo gather, one must first expand;\nto weaken, one must first strengthen;\nto abolish, one must first exalt;\nto take away, one must first give.\nThis is called subtle illumination.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nthe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish must not leave the depths;\nthe state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.\n\n*\"Fixed\"* means *\"first.\"*\nTo gather, first expand—scattered will return to unity.\nTo weaken, first strengthen—advance will turn to retreat.\nTo abolish, first exalt—glory will fade to decline.\nTo take, first give—departure will return again.\nAll things move in mutual dependence;\nprinciples, though faint, become manifest—\nhence it is called *\"subtle illumination.\"*\n\nThe soft and weak overcome the hard and strong,\nsubduing without struggle.\nKnowing fish must not leave the depths,\none knows the Dao does not depart from the self.\nKnowing sharp instruments must not be shown,\none knows the Dao must be realized within.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 37**\n\nThe Dao is eternally non-action, yet nothing is left undone.\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe myriad things will transform themselves.\nWhen transformation stirs desire,\nI will restrain it with nameless simplicity.\nNameless simplicity itself will then be free of desire.\nWithout desire, through stillness,\nthe world will right itself.\n\nNon-action that leaves nothing undone—\nthis non-action is true action,\nwhat is called *\"abiding in the center to govern the outer,\"\ncongealing spirit to form the body.*\nIf lords and kings can hold to it,\nthe myriad things will transform themselves.\nGoverning through reverent non-action,\none may rule all under heaven.\nIs this not the legacy of the great antiquity?\nYet when peace endures and activity arises,\nwhen feasting and splendor flourish—\nthis is no blessing for the state.\n\nI will restrain them with primordial simplicity,\nso they may guard simplicity and return to truth,\nthat those stirred by desire may cease desiring.\nWhen desire ceases, the myriad things grow still.\nWithout seeking to right the world,\nthe world will right itself.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 38**\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—\nthus it possesses virtue.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—\nthus it has no virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue takes no action and has no purpose;\nthe lesser virtue acts and has purpose.\nThe highest benevolence acts but has no purpose;\nthe highest righteousness acts and has purpose.\nThe highest propriety acts, but if none respond,\nit rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.\n\nThus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;\nwhen virtue is lost, benevolence arises;\nwhen benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;\nwhen righteousness is lost, propriety arises.\nPropriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust,\nthe beginning of chaos.\nForesight is the flower of the Dao,\nthe beginning of folly.\n\nTherefore, the great person dwells in the substantial,\nnot the superficial;\nabides in the fruit, not the flower.\nThus, they discard the latter and take the former.\n\nThe person of highest virtue shows no sign of virtue,\nyet possesses its full measure.\nThe person of lesser virtue clings to the name of virtue,\nyet becomes one without virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—\nit abides in non-action,\nletting the myriad things transform themselves without purpose.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—\nit delights in action,\nstirring the hearts of the people toward purpose.\n\nWhat benevolence does is love.\nThe world delights in it—\nthus it has no purpose.\nWhat righteousness does is awe.\nThe world is moved by it—\nthus it has purpose.\n\nYet benevolence is but one benevolence,\nrighteousness but one righteousness.\nAs for propriety—\ncourt rituals change, rural customs differ—\nenforcing it is most difficult.\nIf one forces compliance, the people do not respond,\nand instead roll up their sleeves in contention,\nclinging to their own ways.\nWill not the affairs of the world grow ever harder?\n\nThe great Dao does not contend,\nyet it makes the people not contend—\nhow superior this principle!\nBut once lost, it becomes benevolence;\nlost again, righteousness;\nlost once more, propriety.\n\nThe lament that follows speaks of the turning of the times,\nnot that benevolence and righteousness are partial.\nPropriety, rooted in loyalty and trust,\nwhen customs thin, invites disdain and chaos—\nonly propriety can restore simplicity.\n\nForesight is the radiance of the Dao’s nature,\nyet when its brilliance flames, it breeds folly—\nsuch is the shift in foresight.\nTherefore, the great person stands in the thick, not the thin;\ndwells in the real, not the flowery.\nDiscarding and choosing rightly,\none may say simplicity still lingers among people.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 39**\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nspirits attained the One and became numinous;\nvalleys attained the One and became full;\nthe myriad things attained the One and came to life;\nlords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.\n\nThis attainment was one and the same.\nWithout clarity, heaven would fear splitting;\nwithout stability, earth would fear erupting;\nwithout numinosity, spirits would fear vanishing;\nwithout fullness, valleys would fear drying;\nwithout life, the myriad things would fear perishing;\nwithout the standard of honor and loftiness,\nlords and kings would fear collapse.\n\nThus, the noble takes the humble as its root,\nthe high takes the low as its foundation.\nLords and kings call themselves *\"the orphaned,\"* *\"the widowed,\"* *\"the unworthy.\"*\nIs this not taking the humble as their root?\n\nTherefore, the greatest chariot has no chariot—\none does not desire to gleam like jade\nor clatter like stone.\n\n*\"Of old\"* refers to before the Great Beginning.\n*\"One\"* is the beginning of all numbers.\nThe first thing born is called *\"One.\"*\nBefore the Great Beginning, all was formless;\nafter the Great Beginning, there was surplus.\n\nTo attain this One, one must return to the Great Beginning.\nBetween before and after,\nthere is qi but no form—\nno form, yet trustworthy.\n\nThe Five Phases take water as the One.\nThis water is the utmost purity,\nthe utmost stillness—\nits merit beyond conception.\nTo call it *\"water\"* seems forced;\nnot to call it *\"water\"* is empty.\n\nNow let us trace back from those who attain the One:\n\nThe Dao’s beginning in the past—\nHeaven opened from the past through the One.\nYet without this water, how could it divide?\nHow would its clarity be seen?\n\nEarth unfolded from the past through the One.\nYet without this water, how could it bear?\nHow would its tranquility be established?\n\nSpirits served from the past through the One.\nYet without this water, how could they be sustained?\nHow would their numinosity be revealed?\n\nValleys flowed from the past through the One.\nYet without this water, how could they contain?\nHow would their fullness be aided?\n\nThe myriad things arose from the past through the One.\nYet without this water, how could they be nurtured?\nHow would their life be sustained?\n\nLords and kings arose from the past to rule,\ntaking the One as their lord.\nYet without this water, how could they put it to use?\nHow would they bring steadfast peace to the world?\n\nHeaven and Earth, spirits and valleys, the myriad things, lords and kings—\nthough their forms differ,\nwhat enables their clarity, tranquility,\nnuminosity, fullness, life, and steadfastness\nis all through the One.\n\nClarity without fissure—\nthe qi of water purifies it.\nTranquility without eruption—\nthe qi of water bears it.\nNuminosity without cessation—\nthe qi of water moves it.\nFullness without exhaustion—\nthe qi of water fills it.\nLife without extinction—\nthe qi of water nourishes it.\nSteadfastness without constriction—\nfor the noble and exalted,\nthe virtue of water assists them,\nby its nature lowly and flowing downward.\n\nSince ancient times, rulers have humbled themselves to gain glory,\nthus valuing the lowly as their root,\nand the high taking the low as their foundation.\n*\"The orphaned,\"* *\"the widowed,\"* *\"the unworthy\"*—\nthe self-designations of lords and kings—\nare most lowly and most base.\nYet they do not realize that those who possess the Four Seas,\nwho are honored as the Son of Heaven,\nwho feast on the tribute of all directions,\nattain this precisely through *\"the orphaned,\"* *\"the widowed,\"* *\"the unworthy.\"*\nIs this not taking the lowly as their root?\n\nFor lords and kings to guard their lowliness\nis precisely to guard their One.\nThus, extending this principle to things:\nit is like one who constructs a chariot of many parts,\nturning things into mere vehicles,\nrecklessly driving them by their multitude—\nunaware of their complete ruin.\n\nOr like jade that gleams too brightly,\nor stones that clatter too loudly—\nthose with the appearance of abundance—\nthe highest do not desire them.\n\nReversion is the movement of the Dao,\nweakness its function.\nThe myriad things of the world are born from Being,\nBeing is born from Non-being.\n\nReversion: return.\nHeaven and earth merge in darkness,\nthe first yang returns—\nthis is the Dao’s initial movement.\nWeakness: softness.\nBody and mind tranquil,\nconcentrating qi to attain softness—\nthis is the Dao’s wondrous function.\nThe work of returning the elixir\nlies in taking the Being of Qian and entering the Non-being of Kun,\nQian planting the seed and Kun giving birth,\nNon-being generating Being.\nThus the Dao is born from Being,\nBeing from Non-being.\nAll things under heaven follow this pattern.\n\nThe highest scholar hears the Dao and diligently practices it.\nThe middling scholar hears the Dao and treats it as if it exists, as if it does not.\nThe lowest scholar hears the Dao and laughs loudly at it.\nWithout laughter, it would not suffice as the Dao.\nThus the established sayings declare:\nThe luminous Dao seems dim;\nadvancing in the Dao seems like retreat;\nthe level Dao seems uneven;\nsupreme virtue resembles a valley;\ngreat purity seems tarnished;\nabundant virtue seems insufficient;\nestablished virtue seems indolent;\nsubstance and truth seem altered;\ngreat squareness has no corners;\ngreat vessels are late in completion;\ngreat sound is scarce of voice;\ngreat image has no form.\nOnly the Dao excels in bestowing and accomplishing.\n\nThe Dao of the highest scholar is practiced with diligence as its root.\nWithin it lies no self-display, no self-sharpening,\nno self-differentiation, no self-substantiation,\nno self-manifestation, no self-satisfaction.\nThough practicing as if slack, believing as if deceived,\nonly then can one conceal brilliance and refine slowly,\ndwell in the dust yet guard emptiness,\nobscure one’s traces to seek completion,\ncherish time and revere the Dao.\nOtherwise, one remains with the middling scholar’s existence or nonexistence,\nor the lowest scholar’s loud laughter—\nhow can this be called diligence?\n\nThe middling scholar hears the Dao and practices it intermittently,\nhence it is said to exist and not exist.\nThe lowest scholar hears it and laughs loudly—\nlaughter is the mark of slander.\nYet even loud laughter does no harm to the Dao.\nWithout laughter, it would not be recognized as the supreme Dao.\nThe ancients in their teachings held this meaning:\nThose who cultivate the Dao appear dim though luminous—\nthis is no self-display.\nThey advance as if retreating—\nthis is no self-sharpening.\nSuch is the concealment of brilliance and gradual refinement.\nThey appear uneven though level—\nthis is no self-differentiation.\nSupreme virtue resembles a valley—\nthis is no self-substantiation.\nSuch is dwelling in the dust yet guarding emptiness.\nGreat purity seems tarnished—\nthis is no self-manifestation.\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient—\nthis is no self-satisfaction.\nSuch is obscuring one’s traces to seek completion.\nEstablished virtue seems indolent—\nthough practicing, one appears slack.\nSubstance and truth seem altered—\nthough believing, one appears deceived.\nSuch is cherishing time and revering the Dao.\nAll these are the diligent practices of the highest scholar,\nbeyond the reach of the middling and lowest.\n\nThus, while ordinary squares have corners,\ngreat squareness has none—\nit simply guards the center.\nOrdinary vessels are expected to form early,\nbut great vessels take time—\nthey seek perfection.\nGreat sound, great image,\nvoiceless and formless—\nare these not what the *Doctrine of the Mean* calls\n\"fearful of not hearing, cautious of not seeing\"?\nThose who embrace the Dao in the world,\nendlessly bestowing and bringing great transformation to completion—\nthese are the true highest scholars.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the One,\nthe One gives birth to the Two,\nthe Two gives birth to the Three,\nthe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThe Dao stands above the Three Powers and before the Five Phases.\nThe Supreme One discusses creation,\nthus necessarily beginning with the Dao.\nThe Great Dao is formless,\nvast and boundless.\nWhen stillness gives rise to movement,\nthe One appears.\nThe One is water, in the hexagrams it is Kan.\nKan resides in the north, a laborious hexagram.\nAll things begin and end through it.\nIn ending, the myriad beings return to their root;\nin beginning, the first yang returns.\nYang is fire, thus when speaking of water, fire is within—\nthe One gives birth to the Two.\nWhen water and fire harmonize,\nyin and yang unite in prosperity,\nthe essence of wood stirs,\nand the myriad beings flourish—\nthus the Two gives birth to the Three,\nthe Three gives birth to the myriad things.\nThis speaks generally of creation,\nyet the Dao of the elixir is also within it.\n\nIn my humble opinion:\nThe postnatal sequence is disordered and complex,\nits numbers chaotic and numerous—\nonly when the Five are enumerated are the phases complete.\nMetal generates water: four generates one.\nWater generates wood: one generates three.\nWood generates fire: three generates two.\nFire generates earth: two generates five.\nEarth generates metal: five generates four.\nThe prenatal Five Phases are ordered and simple—\nwhen the Three are enumerated, the Five are encompassed.\nFire arises within water: the One generates the Two.\nWood flourishes through fire: the Two generates the Three.\nWhen wood is born, it is the moment the myriad things first arise—\nthe Three can encompass the myriad.\n\nMoreover, in the method of elixir refinement,\nthe Five Phases are all contained within the One and Two.\nWater and fire are cultivated together,\nthe Three, Four, and Five all assist—\nthus the Three need not be mentioned.\nThe Supreme One speaks of the Three\nonly to exhaustively encompass the myriad things,\nhence the number Three is brought forth.\nYet even the Two need not be mentioned:\nwhen qi becomes the elixir,\nthe Two, Three, Four, and Five all assist—\nthe Five Phases are all contained within the One.\nFire arises within water: the One contains the Two.\nWood mercury is hidden within water: the One contains the Three.\nMetal lead appears within water: the One contains the Four.\nTrue earth is held within water: the One contains the Five.\nYet even the One need not be mentioned:\nthe subtle and obscure,\nthe embryo of emptiness and nothingness—\nthese can be encompassed by the Dao.\nIs not the art of returning the elixir\nthe most simple and the easiest?\nThough the words are many, they return to the essential—\none finds them only more venerable, not excessive.\n\nThe myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,\nharmonizing through the qi of the center.\nAs stated above, the Three gives birth to the myriad things—\nthe Three is the number of wood.\nThings flourish through the vigor of wood,\nwood flourishes through the vigor of fire,\nfire is born within water—\nthus the bodies of the myriad things\nexternally bear yin and internally embrace yang.\n\nExternally yin and internally yang, outwardly empty and inwardly replete—this emptiness enfolds the yang qi, and this is called the *chong qi*. When the nature of things reaches this state, it unites with the Great Harmony.\n\nNow, speaking in terms of the elixir method: when Kun (Earth) joins with Qian (Heaven/Metal), it transforms into Kan (Water). The body of Kan is outwardly empty yet inwardly replete; thus, one should embrace its qi with *chong xu* (penetrating emptiness), like the misty harmony of the Great Harmony.\n\nWhat people despise—being orphaned, widowed, or unprosperous—kings and lords take as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose. What others teach, I also teach: \"The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end\"—I take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nNothing is more despised than base names, yet \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unprosperous\" are such names, and kings and lords use them to refer to themselves. Though their titles are diminished, in truth, they gain thereby. Thus, observing things, one sees that gain may turn to loss, and loss may yield gain—this is known through contemplating the Way of the *Yi*.\n\nIn the *Pi* hexagram, Heaven is above and Earth below; to transform this into benefit, the Way of Heaven does not dare exalt itself. Thus, it diminishes above to augment below, and the stagnation of Heaven and Earth not joining may become the benefit of the above descending to the below. Therefore, the noble person uses this to reform faults and amend errors.\n\nIn the *Tai* hexagram, Earth is above and Heaven below; to know the good of diminution, the Way of Earth does not presume to be full. Thus, it diminishes below to augment above, and the harmony of Heaven and Earth joining also follows the principle of the above acting through diminution. Therefore, the noble person uses this to curb anger and restrain desires.\n\nHeaven and Earth gain through loss—thus, employing gain is not as effective as employing loss. Though the two hexagrams stand side by side, one should emulate the side of *Sun* (Diminution). Moreover, when *Shan Ze Sun* (Mountain and Marsh Diminishing) is inverted, it becomes *Feng Lei Yi* (Wind and Thunder Benefiting). The resonance of mountain, marsh, wind, and thunder arises precisely from diminution.\n\nThis is the teaching—the teaching of the *Yi*, the teaching of the ancients. The Most High said: \"What others teach, I also teach—to teach people to know self-diminution.\"\n\nThe unskilled serve as the resource for the skilled—thus, the strong and overbearing are called the \"teaching fathers.\" The strong and overbearing are those who seize and plunder, diminishing others to augment themselves, yet in the end gain nothing. *Fu* (father) here shares the same pronunciation as *fu* (beginning), read in the rising tone.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Partial Application\"; Peng’s edition titles it \"Utmost Softness\")*\n\nThe softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest under Heaven. The non-existent enters where there is no gap—thus do I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few under Heaven can attain this.\n\nThe \"utmost soft\" refers to *qi* and water. *Qi* reaches every unobstructed aperture; water finds every unblocked path—thus they gallop through the hardest without gap. Mountains disgorge stones; springs pierce mountains—this is visible. The \"non-existent\" refers to that without form or substance, only *qi* and water, which can likewise reach our bodies and enter where there is no gap.\n\nThe first two lines speak generally of *qi* and water under Heaven; this line refers specifically to the body, setting forth the analogy. It further states: \"Thus do I know the benefit of non-action.\" Non-action means no forced movement, only natural surging. To unite the teaching without words with the benefit of non-action—truly, none under Heaven can match this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Establishing Admonitions\"; Peng’s edition titles it \"Valuing the Name\")*\n\nWhich is closer—name or self?\nWhich is greater—self or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\n\nTherefore, excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures.\n\nThe self is closer than the name; the self is greater than wealth. Gaining the self brings no harm; losing the self brings harm. This principle is self-evident.\n\nThus, the Most High uses \"which is closer,\" \"which is greater,\" and \"which is more harmful\" to awaken people, stirring their innate conscience so they may realize for themselves—not like later generations’ didactic texts, which merely reproach and instead provoke resistance. This is the Most High’s humility and harmony.\n\nYet in the world, some grow close to their name while estranging their self, amass wealth while diminishing their self, value gain over the self, and feel no pain at its loss. Such deep delusion stems from prizing fame and profit while neglecting self-preservation.\n\nHow pitiful when the last breath is drawn, the final hour arrives, the name vanishes into nothingness, wealth becomes an empty fiction, and the lost one falls into ghostly realms, never to regain human form!\n\nFor one living in the world, what builds my name depletes my spirit; what enters through perversity exits likewise—this is what is meant by \"excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss.\" Attachment that incurs great expense is disgrace; hoarding that leads to heavy loss is danger—neither is a path to endurance.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Most High speaks to awaken and teach: \"Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures.\" Such is the virtue of the sage.\n\nThe Great Achievement appears deficient, yet its function never wears out.\nThe Utmost Fullness appears empty, yet its function is inexhaustible.\nThe Utmost Straightness appears bent,\nthe Utmost Skill appears clumsy,\nthe Utmost Eloquence appears inarticulate.\n\nRestlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.\nClarity and stillness are the correct governance of the world.\n\nThe Great Achievement appears deficient—like the light of the sun and moon, round yet temporarily eclipsed, advancing to regain its brightness, thus its function never wears out.\nThe Utmost Fullness appears empty—like the vastness of the sea, embracing all without overflow, boundless and without limit, thus its function is inexhaustible.\nThose who are excessively straight are reckless;\nthose who rely on cunning are deceitful;\nthose who force eloquence are false—\nnone can compare to the great.\n\nThe sage and worthy use qi to attain straightness,\nnot flaunting hardness yet inherently hard, appearing bent;\ntheir divine subtlety becomes skill,\nnot displaying wisdom yet inherently wise, appearing clumsy;\ntheir virtue and Dao become eloquence,\nnot speaking much yet speaking well, appearing inarticulate.\n\nAs for refining lead and fire into harmony,\nthree winters can be endured;\nsitting steadfast on a rush cushion,\nthe heat of nine summers can be forgotten—\nthis is precisely what is meant by \"restlessness overcomes cold; stillness overcomes heat.\"\nThese two principles embody the workings of yin and yang.\nIf one can observe the qi of dryness and dampness, cold and warmth\nwith a heart of clarity, emptiness, and stillness,\nthen the correct Way of the world is attained.\n\nWhen the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields. When the world loses the Dao, even mares in the wild give birth on the battlefield.\n\nNo crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Thus, contentment in sufficiency is perpetual sufficiency.\n\n\"Following the Dao\" refers to the time when the *yin* phase has reached its extreme and *yang* begins to rise after a long period of *pi* (adversity). \"Losing the Dao\" refers to the time when the *tai* (prosperity) phase has lasted too long and *yin* begins to emerge from the extreme of *yang*. When *pi* (adversity) is resolved and *tai* (order) is established, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields—nothing in the world remains unaccomplished. When *tai* (prosperity) flourishes and *pi* (disorder) lies dormant, warhorses are bred even in the outskirts—affairs of the world demand action. Yet from disorder, renewal begins, and *tai* (order) brings blessing.\n\nTo see what is desirable and desire it—no crime is greater. To be content yet remain discontent—no disaster is greater. To covet what one ought not—no fault is greater. Therefore, one who finds sufficiency in contentment attains perpetual sufficiency.\n\n**Supplementary Note:**\n*Que* (却) means \"to remove.\" *Fen* (粪) means \"to cultivate.\" When the world is at peace, though horses are unused, they still exist. To \"remove\" them means to send them to the mountains and marshes, akin to the idea of \"returning horses to pasture.\" Moreover, horses are not meant for tilling fields; the phrase \"to fertilize\" is used as a metaphor for the withdrawal of arms and the rise of agriculture.\n\nHe who does not step beyond his door knows the world.\nHe who does not peer through his window sees the Dao of Heaven.\nThe farther he ventures, the less he knows.\nThus the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without acting.\n\n*Hu* (户): a small door. By not going out yet knowing worldly affairs, seclusion clarifies worldly matters.\n*You* (牖): a small window. Without peering yet seeing Heaven’s Dao, the hidden and subtle reveal the manifest.\nBody, mind, nature, and life—these are where the Dao resides.\nTo abandon the near and pursue the distant is the way of fools.\nWhat cannot be seen, heard, or grasped—where does one begin the search?\nHe who understands this truth finds the Dao between door and window.\nHe who does not grows ever more lost with each inquiry, more confused with each question.\nEvery path seems right, yet none can be fully traversed—\nthis is what it means to venture farther and know less.\n\nOnly the sage knows without traveling, for when the spirit is settled, wisdom arises.\nHe names without seeing, for holding to non-being gives rise to being.\nHe accomplishes without acting, for embracing the One returns to emptiness.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Eight**\nIn the pursuit of learning, one gains daily.\nIn the pursuit of the Dao, one loses daily.\nLose and lose again, until one reaches non-action.\nThrough non-action, nothing is left undone.\nThus he who would govern the world must always act without interference.\nIf he interferes, he is unfit to govern the world.\n\nThe pursuit of learning differs from the pursuit of the Dao.\nLearning values accumulation, yet even in learning, one may progress from breadth to simplicity—what was gained is not without loss.\nThe Dao values reduction, yet even in the Dao, one may establish a foundation through worldly affairs—what was lost is not without gain.\nReduction means to strip away.\nLose and lose again, until the leaden *qi* dries and the mercury’s light appears,\nuntil one nurtures the spirit and returns to emptiness,\nacting through my non-action—\nthus nothing is left undone.\n\nTo govern the world, one must first settle the world with a steadfast heart.\nAct through non-action, and nothing is left undone.\nRespond to movement with stillness, make virtue the constant,\ncultivate governance with benevolence—\nthen the people will join hands and come together,\nand all nations will turn their hearts toward unity.\nThus one may govern the world.\nThis is why one must always act without interference.\nIf one interferes, there will first be upheaval across the land.\nActing through action, one multiplies action,\nmeeting force with force, destruction with destruction, violence with violence.\nTo make war one’s skill and plunder one’s task\nis to disturb the world and put oneself before it—\nhow can one govern the world thus?\n\nSome say that those who govern the world must be men of non-action shouldering the burdens of action,\nas were the recluses of Xinye, Panxi, and Nanyang in ancient times.\nYet when the affairs of the world weigh on their hearts,\ntheir minds become disordered—\nas with Fan Zeng’s grudge against Liu Bang or Xu Yuanzhi’s devotion to his mother.\nThis interpretation also holds.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Nine**\nThe sage has no fixed heart; he takes the hearts of the people as his own.\nTo the good, I am good; to the not-good, I am also good—thus virtue is goodness.\nTo the trustworthy, I am trustworthy; to the untrustworthy, I am also trustworthy—thus virtue is trustworthiness.\n\nWhen the sage is in the world, he humbly unifies his heart with the world.\nThe people all turn their ears and eyes toward him, and the sage treats them all as children.\n\nHaving no fixed heart means having no partiality.\nWith no partiality, he can shield and embrace the people, harmonizing with their hearts.\nWhat the people hope for is that the sage will treat them with goodness and trustworthiness.\nEven the not-good and the untrustworthy receive goodness and trustworthiness—\nhow great is the sincerity of the sage’s virtue!\n\nThus when the sage is in the world, humbly unifying his heart with the world,\nhe shields and embraces the people.\nThe people all turn their ears and eyes toward him, each with their own hopes,\nand the sage treats them all as children—thus he unifies them.\n*Diedie* (惵惵): the appearance of sincerity.\n\n**Chapter Fifty**\nFrom birth one enters death.\nThose who follow life are thirteen in number.\nThose who follow death are thirteen in number.\nThose who live yet move toward the realm of death are also thirteen in number.\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they overindulge in the pursuit of life.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being harmed by weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this so? Because they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nAll things emerge into life and enter death, all falling within the thirteen. As for these thirteen, past commentaries have not grasped their true meaning, which I now clarify. The number ten represents the generative numbers of Heaven and Earth. One Heaven, one Earth; one *qian*, one *kun*. The *qian* hexagram has three yang lines, the *kun* hexagram three yin lines. All things meet the three yang and are born, meet the three yin and die. Only humans, in receiving life, share the three yang with other beings, yet their entry into the three yin is self-accelerated. The seven emotions and six desires greatly harm the original spirit, hence it is said they \"move toward the realm of death.\" Yet even this self-acceleration returns to the three yin alone.\n\nWhy do beings and humans have three births and three deaths? When the pursuit of life is excessive, the dead are extinguished, and the living are replenished. The dead are at rest, the living in motion—this is the cyclical, interdependent pattern. Otherwise, if there were life without death, the teeming multitudes would fill the world; how could there be a place of repose?\n\nThough the death of all things lies in winter and their birth in spring, their life and death are but the alternation of movement and stillness. For humans, however, death does not return to life. This is not because creation singles out humanity for harsh treatment, but because they do not know how to nurture life, thus continually entering the realm of death.\n\nThe Supreme Lord possesses the virtue of cherishing life, and the sage possesses the method of nurturing life. If one seeks wisely, one should transform the path of \"yang birth and yin death\" into the work of \"yang departing and yin arriving,\" thereby attaining long life and enduring vision, no longer sharing the fate of those who, though newly born, move toward the realm of death.\n\nThings are born through three and die through three. The Way of nurturing life thus takes the three yang of the *qian* hexagram and plants one yang within the three yin, so that *kun* becomes substantial and forms *kan*. The three yin of the *kun* hexagram sprout one yin within the three yang, so that *qian* becomes hollow and forms *li*. *Kan* and *li* are the medicinal substances. Entering seclusion and cultivating stillness, one observes the return of one’s solitary yang, then gathers and returns it, gathers and subjugates it. Thus nurturing life is the Way of the Returned Elixir, the work of returning to the root, the art of extending life, the secret of becoming an immortal.\n\nTo reverse and return is nurturing; to move from below to above is nurturing; to turn from outer to inner is nurturing; only with the Yellow Dame within can one nurture. Nurturing is not easily spoken of. Mother and child cherish each other, and nurturing runs deep; the infant and maiden unite, and joy is great; lead and mercury conjoin, and the sacred embryo forms; through non-doing, one verifies and the yang spirit emerges. Though tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons may assail, they have no power to bring calamity. How then could one share the three yang for birth and three yin for death with ordinary people and things?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes them, things shape them, and conditions complete them. Therefore, all things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command but always naturally.\n\nThus the Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes, rears, raises, completes, ripens, tends, and shelters them. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\nThe Dao sows things, virtue protects them; thus things are born by the Dao and nourished by virtue. Things manifest form, and through conditions they are completed. All things revere the Dao and honor virtue because the Dao is nameless while virtue has a name. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise without command, for the principles of things naturally converge.\n\nOnly the Dao presides over their birth, only virtue presides over their nourishment. It rears and raises, completes and ripens, tends and shelters. Preserving and protecting the spirit are all the arts of virtue. Not possessing, not relying, nor dominating, accomplishing through non-doing—this is true understanding. Profound virtue is the highest virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world. Having attained the mother, one knows her children. Having known the children, one again guards the mother, and to the end of life one does not perish.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates, and to the end of life one will not toil. Open the openings, aid one’s affairs, and to the end of life one will not be saved. Seeing the small is called clarity, guarding the soft is called strength. Use its light, return to its clarity, and one will leave no calamity for the self. This is called inheriting the constant.\n\nThe Way of the world has an end and thus a beginning, yet its beginning is not singular. The Golden Elixir has a place from which it first emerges, a practice with which it first proceeds, and a substance to which it first returns.\n\nWhat is the place of first emergence? The *kun* furnace and the yin furnace are one. Yin conceals yang, hence it is called the yin-yang furnace. The moon appears in the *dui* direction, hence it is called the inverted moon furnace. *Dui* is the youngest maiden, hence it is called the primordial wondrous tripod. The *Awakening to Reality* calls it the \"source of medicinal production\"—all are places of beginning.\n\nWhat is the practice of first proceeding? To reach the utmost emptiness, to guard perfect stillness, I observe their return. Turbidity settles and slowly clears; tranquility endures, and slowly life emerges—all are the first practices.\n\nWhat is the substance of first return? The undifferentiated and complete, the profound and obscure—within it there is sincerity, within it there is essence. The uncarved block without name, the formless gold—all are the first substances. The Returned Elixir takes this gold as its beginning, hence it is said to have a beginning. Yet this gold is not a native substance of the *kun* household; it is the fiery essence of the *qian* household.\n\nThe elixir method takes cinnabar as its primary agent. Entering the *kun* furnace, it forms *kan*, harmonizing with the mercury of the Jade Pond to become *wu* earth—*wu* earth is the yang elixir.\n\nThe yang elixir is the external elixir, and the external elixir is the root of the elixir. The Golden Flower is it, the True Seed is it, the Yellow Sprout is it, the White Snow is it. Taking the external elixir as the mother of the internal elixir, thus it is said to have a beginning as the Mother of All Under Heaven. The mother has a sacred name, called Yang Lead. Where there is Yang Lead as mother, there is Yin Mercury as child. Yin Mercury is the postnatal qi of the child, while Yang Lead is the prenatal qi of the mother. When the external Yang Lead subdues the internal Yin Mercury, mother and child meet—hence it is said, \"Know the child.\"\n\nYet this coming of Yang Lead requires the wondrous application of fire. For Lead is born in the *kan* palace, sunken and unmoving. To capture and restrain the true Mercury of the *li* palace, one must employ fierce fire for intense refinement, whereupon it soars upward. After meeting with true Mercury, one should then guard the city and bathe, refraining from applying fierce fire. At first, the mother comes longing for the child; later, the child lingers longing for the mother—thus it is said, \"Having known the child, return to guard the mother.\" When mother and child long for one another without end, the Great Elixir is accomplished.\n\nThe Great Elixir is called the internal medicine; the Sacred Embryo is this, the Infant is this, the True Person is this. In nurturing the internal elixir, one must possess the natural true fire, continuously simmering within the earthen crucible, and also employ the external furnace’s yin-yang talismanic fire, diligently adjusting its intensity. Through the operations of withdrawal and addition, form is transformed into qi, and qi into spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth. Thus one must block the *dui*, close the gate, and devote oneself to this practice for life.\n\nThere are two kinds of nurturing: the internal civil fire and the external talismanic fire. Preserving it for ten months, one abandons effortful action to realize effortless action—hence one dare not busy oneself with external affairs, disturbing the inner stillness of the chamber. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Securely seal their juncture, striving to make it complete and firm. Observe and attend with utmost care, carefully regulating warmth and coolness. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node is exhausted, renew your closeness.\" This is the work of nurturing.\n\nThe inner realm does not leak outward, the outer realm does not intrude inward—blocking the *dui* and closing the gate is the essential technique. If one does not block the *dui*, one will daily engage with external affairs. Daoists often discuss worldly matters, wishing to aid external endeavors, yet first harming their inner cultivation. When the mouth opens, spirit and qi scatter; when the mind is disordered, the fire’s work grows cold. The great path of longevity, I fear, will not be achieved—hence it is said, \"If you assist in such affairs, you will never recover for life.\"\n\nThe \"small\" refers to the golden light of the elixir, its form like a grain of millet—thus it is called \"small.\" To see this small is called \"bright.\" The \"yielding\" refers to the body’s royal water, whose qi is fundamentally harmonious—thus it is called \"yielding.\" To guard this yielding is called \"strong.\" The \"light\" is spirit, the very golden light. The \"bright\" is qi, the very golden essence. When golden light envelops golden essence, light and brightness are concealed within, spirit and qi interdependent. The work of embryo nurturing is accomplished, and the body escapes calamity—thus it is said, \"Use its light, return to its brightness, leaving no misfortune for the body.\" This is the Way of inheriting the constant, the cultivation of long life and enduring vision.\n\nTo \"inherit the constant\" is to guard one’s true constancy. My mountain appraisal: This chapter is clarified sentence by sentence, each word extracted with precision—the Way of the Returned Elixir is fully revealed here. I have often said that the scriptures of the Most High are concise yet comprehensive, even true immortals cannot fully comprehend them—how exceptionally clear is this commentary! How joyous! How delightful!\n\nChapter Fifty-Three\n*(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter of Increasing Evidence\"; Peng’s version calls it the \"Chapter of Unwavering Resolve\")*\n\nWere I to possess unwavering knowledge,\nI would walk the great Dao,\nfearing only deviation.\nThe great Dao is utterly smooth,\nyet the people prefer byways.\n\nCourts are swept clean,\nfields lie fallow,\ngranaries stand empty.\nThey don fine brocades,\ngird themselves with sharp swords,\nsurfeit on food and drink,\nhoard wealth in excess—\nthis is called the \"thieving pole.\"\nHow far from the Dao!\n\n*I*: refers to my lineage, not the Old Sage’s self-reference.\n*Unwavering (介然)*: steadfast resolve.\nMy lineage’s nature is perfectly luminous;\nwere I to stabilize myself with unwavering resolve,\nI would possess both steadfastness and complete awakening.\nTo personally walk the great Dao,\nfearing only deviation—\nfor deviation follows outward dispersion,\ngreatly depleting my true essence,\nand thus is to be feared.\n\nAccumulating essence and amassing qi\ncan refine one into truth—\nthis is the great Dao’s level path,\nthe shared road all should follow.\nYet the people’s hearts prefer byways,\ncompeting to enter crooked paths.\nDelusion invites misfortune;\nessence withers, spirit scatters.\n\nLike a court’s former halls,\nonce purged and stripped,\nthe primordial yang is utterly lost.\nLike fields’ boundaries,\nall fallen to waste,\nthe gates and orifices are wholly blocked.\nLike granaries’ stores,\nall reduced to emptiness,\nthe essence and qi are entirely gone.\n\nThey merely don fine brocades,\ngird themselves with sharp swords,\nchase after feasts and revelry,\nvainly imagining their wealth sufficient.\nSuch ones fix their hearts on pilfering the Dao’s name,\nlike thieves who use poles to hook objects over walls—\nthis is called the \"thieving pole\" and nothing more.\nHow far from the Dao!\nHow far from the Dao!\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Four**\n*(He Shang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Chapter on Cultivating Observation\";

Peng’s edition titles it \"The Chapter on Embracing Virtue\")*\n\nOne who embraces profound virtue\nis like an infant:\npoisonous creatures do not sting,\nfierce beasts do not seize,\ngrasping birds of prey do not strike.\nBones weak, sinews soft, yet the grip is firm.\nUnknowing of the union of female and male, yet the organ stirs—\nsuch is the perfection of essence.\nAll day crying, yet the throat does not grow hoarse—\nsuch is the perfection of harmony.\n\nTo know harmony is called constancy;\nto know constancy is called clarity.\nTo augment life is called auspicious.\nThe heart directing qi is called force.\n\nWhen things reach their prime, they age—\nthis is called \"not the Dao.\"\nWhat is not the Dao soon perishes.\n\n*Embrace* (含): to hold within.\nThose who hold virtue profoundly are true persons.\nThe heart of the true person never loses the heart of an infant,\nthus they are like an infant, utterly forgetful of externals.\nTherefore, noxious creatures, beasts, or birds harm them.\nBones weak, sinews soft—this is the body of a child,\nthus the grip is firm.\nPeople know the joy of male-female union,\nyet such knowledge leads to the stirring of the organ and the loss of life.\nThe infant, without knowledge, embodies the perfection of pure essence—\nthis is the absence of desire.\n*Organ* (朘): the infant’s yin; also, contraction.\nVulgarly, *retraction* is called *朘缩*—contraction without arousal.\nPeople, through anger, disrupt their harmony, and their voices grow hoarse.\nThe infant, however, may cry and wail yet never grow hoarse.\n*Cry* (号) is calling; *wail* (嗌) is sobbing.\nAll day calling and sobbing without hoarseness—\nsuch is the perfection of harmony.\nOne who knows harmony abides in constancy without peril.\nI who know constancy attain true clarity.\nWhat benefits human life is the infant’s auspicious harmony.\nYet if one possesses knowledge and awareness,\nusing the heart to direct qi,\nthey turn from softness to force.\nThose who love force in the world—\nhave they ever observed this in things?\nThe explanation of the final three lines appears in Chapter Thirty.\n\n(This chapter is titled *The Chapter of Mysterious Virtue* in the Heshang Gong commentary and *The Chapter of Mysterious Sameness* in Peng’s version.)\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\nBlock the apertures, shut the gates,\nblunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,\nsoften the light, merge with the dust—\nthis is called *mysterious sameness*.\n\nIt cannot be approached with intimacy,\nnor distanced with estrangement;\nit cannot be gained through profit,\nnor harmed by injury;\nit cannot be exalted as noble,\nnor debased as lowly.\nThus it is most precious under heaven.\n\nThose who *know* are those who have attained through practice. *Not speaking* is because speech is difficult. For their understanding runs deep, and though the heart wishes to speak, the mouth cannot keep pace. If one merely exalts speech, claiming some immortal’s scripture or true transmission has exhausted all that needs to be said—no teacher’s guidance required, the Dao can be practiced—how can they know that while the truth is indeed true, its subtle details, its layered metaphors, its profound mechanisms may yet elude them? Moreover, ascending to truth and entering the Dao ultimately depend on the *returned elixir*. Only when the principle of the returned elixir is clear can one attain the Dao.\n\nNow, let me ask you:\n*Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Dui*—what trigrams are these?\nDragon and tiger, mercury and lead—what alchemical substances are these?\nGuest and host, female and male—how are they distinguished in function?\nThe indistinct and the obscure—how are they embodied?\nThe floating and the sinking, the inverted and the upright—how are they arranged?\nWithout clarity on the *mysterious female*, one cannot engage in transformation.\nWithout summoning the *Yellow Dame*, how can union be achieved?\nBeyond this, words are hard to convey,\nauthority hard to establish,\nthe primary scripture hard to find,\nthe firing times hard to grasp.\n\nFurthermore, as the ancients said: *The great matter of the golden elixir must be pursued with the help of one who has power.* Where in which book is the wondrous use of such a powerful one recorded? Moreover, the practice and discipline of the work include elements that cannot be conveyed by books alone: cutting off sensual desire,轻财利, relinquishing affection, guarding virtue—these are all matters of personal cultivation, not things that can be resolved through texts.\n\nOnly when a sincere heart seeks the Dao,\nmoving heaven above,\ndissolving worldly thoughts,\nand receiving the silent aid of the numinous,\ncan one come to know the Dao.\nTo seek a steed by following a picture—how can this suffice to grasp its subtleties?\nThus, *those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know*—because there are things that are difficult to speak of.\n\nSome may ask: *\"If knowing is indeed difficult to speak of, how can those who are yet unenlightened come to hear of it? Must there not be those who can speak to guide their knowing?\"* The alchemical classics say: *Only with a teacher’s oral instructions can one attain the Dao.* This seems to imply that those who know must speak, and those who speak must know. Let me explain further.\n\n*Oral instructions* are intimate words, subtle words—layer upon layer of breakthroughs, not mere isolated phrases or a few sentences. When the Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, they spoke in detail for three days. When my teacher met Ancestor Zhong, they sat in discussion for ten days. Even for those of heavenly sincerity and the highest spiritual capacity, a few words cannot suffice—how much less for those below?\n\nToday, people mistake *oral instructions* for shortcuts; this is wrong. When oral instructions are incomplete, the teacher departs and returns. During discussion, one listens closely and commits to memory, so as to connect with ancient texts and illuminate the stages. This is the wonder of oral instructions. When one has read many alchemical classics, a single hearing of oral instructions can bring sudden awakening. The classics verify the instructions, and the instructions verify the classics—true and unfailing, in accord with the great Dao. This is why a true teacher must be sought, and why mere cleverness cannot be relied upon.\n\nMoreover, the root of a true teacher lies in one who has cultivated virtue and refined it into attainment. How could they not know the profound and secret words that heaven bestows upon the good and withholds from the unworthy? If one knows yet speaks lightly of them, why did Master Ziyang receive three divine reprimands? Their silence is not unwillingness to speak, but a reluctance to speak lightly.\n\nEven when great vessels meet and the transmission is urgent, the teacher must repeatedly test and refine the disciple. Only after the disciple’s diligence and the teacher’s toil do they swear an oath, light incense, and pass on the bowl of transmission. From this day forward, the lineage extends into the future—take care not to hear and fail to practice, nor to receive and hoard in secret. Given all this, is speaking not difficult?\n\nIn my commentary on the *Daodejing*, though more detailed than those of earlier scholars, each chapter’s annotations follow the text and leave its words intact, unable to fully articulate the wondrous mechanisms of the alchemical Dao in complete passages. Heroes and aspirants, if you can find a wise teacher to point them out, attaining the method will be all the easier.\n\n*Blocking the apertures and shutting the gates* nurtures spirit and qi.\n*Blunting sharpness* without being blunted by sharpness—this is the ability to guard weakness.\n*Untangling knots* without being entangled by them—this is the ability to remain serene.\n*Softening the light* to conceal its brilliance,\n*merging with the dust* to transcend it—\nMencius said: *The sage’s relation to the people is also like this.*\nThis is the essence of *mysterious sameness*.\n\nThus, it cannot be approached with intimacy, nor distanced with estrangement. If it could be approached with intimacy, it could also be distanced with estrangement. The same applies to profit and harm, nobility and lowliness. Therefore, it is the most precious under heaven—nothing surpasses the sage’s virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\n(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Pure Wind*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Governing with Rectitude*)\n\nGovern the state with rectitude,\ndeploy troops with奇,\nwin the world through non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this.\n\nThe world abounds with taboos, and the people grow ever poorer. The people possess many sharp tools, and the state sinks deeper into chaos. The people cultivate many clever skills, and strange artifacts proliferate. Laws and decrees multiply, and thieves and bandits abound. Thus the sage declares: *I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves; I harbor no desires, and the people return to simplicity.*\n\nRectitude is not mere idle governance—it truly embodies the teaching of reverence, moving people to respond with sincerity. The extraordinary is not mere deceit—it truly embodies the teaching of quiet mastery, making one’s intentions inscrutable. Thus one must govern the state with rectitude and deploy troops with the extraordinary. To win the world through non-interference is to achieve success through non-action. By this, I mean: the Way of cultivating the self reveals the Way of governing the world.\n\nWhen the court teems with taboos, corrupt and base ministers advance, impoverishing the people. When the people possess many sharp tools, scheming and deceitful men arise, plunging the state into deeper chaos. When clever skills please the ruler, strange and extravagant objects multiply. When laws and decrees disdain the people, thieves and bandits flourish. These are all perversions of good governance.\n\nThus the sage’s words are recalled to observe the constancy of the Way of governance—it lies solely in the distinction between having desires and having none.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Eight**\n*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Harmonious Transformation*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Governance*)*\n\nWhen governance is muted and unobtrusive, the people are simple and sincere.\nWhen governance is sharp and exacting, the people are restless and lacking.\nMisfortune—fortune leans upon it;\nFortune—misfortune lurks within it.\nWho knows their ultimate end? Is there no constancy?\nRectitude reverts to the extraordinary,\nGoodness reverts to the ominous.\nThe people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.\n\nTherefore the sage is square but does not cut,\nsharp but does not wound,\nstraight but does not stretch,\nluminous but does not dazzle.\n\n*Muted and unobtrusive (閟閟)*: a manner of honest simplicity.\n*Simple and sincere (醇醇)*: a state of tranquil composure.\nWhen governance fosters simplicity, the people rest in stillness.\n*Sharp and exacting (察察)*: harsh and demanding.\n*Restless and lacking (缺缺)*: negligent and careless.\nWhen governance is harsh and demanding, the people grow negligent.\n\nThe beginnings of fortune and misfortune’s mutual dependence—people should know their ultimate end and uphold constancy. The phrase *\"who knows\"* implies a lament that people do not understand. If one does not know the ultimate end, how can there be any who uphold constancy?\n\nRectitude, the straight path, reverts to the extraordinary and perverse—all because there is no constancy. Goodness, originally auspicious, reverts to the ominous and baleful—also because there is no constancy. If this is so, how could the people’s descent into delusion be the fault of a single morning or evening?\n\n*Cut*: to sever.\n*Wound*: to injure.\n*Stretch*: to act without restraint.\n*Dazzle*: to display ostentation.\nThese four are the delusions of the people.\n\nOnly the sage is vast and uncornered, requiring no severing;\npure and self-contained, avoiding injury;\nstraight yet restrained, never overreaching;\nradiant yet not dazzling—thus walking the true path of the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Nine**\n*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Guarding the Dao*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Roots and Foundations*)*\n\nGoverning people and serving Heaven—nothing compares to frugality; this is called \"early compliance.\" \"Early compliance\" means accumulating virtue in abundance. Accumulating virtue in abundance leads to invincibility; being invincible means none can fathom its limits. When none can fathom its limits, one may possess the state. Possessing the state’s foundational power, one may endure long. This is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n*Frugality*: thrift.\n*Early compliance*: referring to enriching the state and pacifying the people.\n*Accumulating virtue*: referring to the people’s peace and the state’s prosperity.\n*Invincibility*: triumph.\nTo say it plainly: governing with reverence for thrift enables the enrichment of the state and pacification of the people, ensuring their peace and the state’s prosperity, and rendering all battles victorious. Being ever-victorious, none can discern its bounds. Gradually, with profound benevolence and deep kindness, one may surely attain the state. The *state* here refers to the nation’s foundation. Once the foundation is established, one casts true cinnabar into the jade pool, first refining the lead-mother. When the lead-mother captures the mercury-child, the state may be enjoyed long. This is the cultivation of deep roots and firm stems, the Way of long life and enduring vision.\n\n*Roots and stems*: returning to the root to subdue one’s qi, nurturing the stem to preserve one’s spirit.\n\n**Chapter Sixty**\n*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Occupying the Throne*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Refining the Delicate*)*\n\nGoverning a great state is like cooking a small fish.\n\nWith the Dao presiding over the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity.\nNot that its ghosts lose their numinosity—\ntheir numinosity does no harm to people.\nNot that their numinosity does no harm to people—\nthe sage also does no harm to people.\nWhen the two do not harm one another,\ntheir virtues converge and return.\n\nCooking differs from cutting: cutting values separation, while cooking values harmony.\n*Small fish*: small things.\nViewing a great state as a small thing lies solely in harmonizing the people’s sentiments.\n\n*Ghosts*: demons.\n*Numinosity*: spirits.\n*Does no harm*: does not disturb.\nThis means that with the Dao as the foundation of governance, though demons possess spirit, they do not disturb.\nIt is not that they do not disturb people—\nthe sage governs with stillness and does not disturb people,\nso how dare demons disturb them?\nThus, demons and people forget one another,\nand the sage’s virtue subdues all.\n\n*Converge and return*: all submit.\n\n**Chapter Sixty-One**\n*(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Humble Virtue*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Lower Currents*)*\n\nA great state is the lower current,\nthe confluence of the world,\nthe female of the world.\nThe female always overcomes the male with stillness,\nusing stillness as her lower position.\n\nThus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,\nit wins over the small state.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nit wins over the great state.\nTherefore, some win by humbling themselves,\nwhile others win by being humble.\n\nA great state, being too great, desires to shelter others.\nA small state, being too small, desires to serve others.\nWhen both attain what they desire,\nthe greater should remain humble.\n\nThis chapter instructs the lords of the world to cultivate humility in order to embrace smaller states.\n*Lower current*: where all waters converge, likened to a great state uniting lesser ones.\nThus, a great state is the lower current—not that it dwells in a lowly position.\nIt unites tributary states, hence called the confluence of the world.\nIt should employ gentle virtue, thus compared to the female of the world.\n\n*Female*: the Way of softness.\n*Male*: the Way of hardness.\nThough small states may be hard, a great state overcomes them with soft stillness,\nso stillness is the virtue of humility.\n\nWhen a great state humbles itself before a small state,\nthe small state delights in serving as its vassal,\nand each year may offer tribute.\nWhen a small state humbles itself before a great state,\nthe great state often rewards it,\nand each year may bestow gifts.\nThus, some win by humbling themselves,\nwhile others win by being humble.\nGreat and small naturally rely on one another.\n\nA great state, in its excess, resembles the *Great Exceeding* hexagram:\nan old man obtaining a young woman—\nexcessive yet harmonious—\nthus possessing the virtue of sheltering others,\nmeaning it seeks to preserve small states.\nA small state, in its modest success, resembles the *Small Exceeding* hexagram:\nmoving with the times—\nexcessive yet properly aligned—\nthus possessing the Way of serving others,\nmeaning it seeks to depend on great states.\nWhen great and small each attain their desires,\nit is because the greater humbles itself before the lesser.\nOtherwise, though the ruler of a small state may wish to serve a great state,\nif the great state oppresses it,\nthe small state will not willingly submit.\n\nThe grand purport of this teaching is to instruct the lords of great states in the principle of gentle reciprocity with distant lands,\nyet its subtle implications for self-cultivation are equally profound.\n\nLet us now expound it:\n\nThe *great state* is Kunlun.\nThe *lower current* is the primordial sea.\nThe fluids of Kunlun descend into the primordial sea,\nmeaning the primordial sea connects with Kunlun—\nthus, a great state is the lower current,\nnot that Kunlun dwells in a lowly position.\n\nThe *lower current* is the confluence of the world.\n*Confluence*: attachment.\nAll submission and dependence reside here—\nthis is the Yellow Court.\n\nThe virtue of the lower current is the female of the world.\n*Female*: softness.\nConcentrating qi to achieve softness lies here,\nhence it is called the female gate.\n\nWithin the female gate’s cavity resides primordial essence.\nBy quietly gathering kidney qi within it,\nthe kidneys are first regarded as the female gate,\nand the heart as the male.\nYet now, the self is considered female,\nand the other male—\nthis reverses hardness and softness,\nnot female and male.\n\nThe heart’s fire is by nature hard and restless;\nwater’s stillness can restrain fire’s movement—\nthis is the coming of lead,\nwhich can restrain mercury’s flight.\n\n*Using stillness as her lower position*:\nemploying silence and softness,\ncultivating humility to stabilize the heart-mind.\n\nThus, Kunlun’s sweet fluids flow into the primordial sea.\nThe fluids transform into qi,\nentering the cinnabar field.\nA great state humbling itself before a small state\nis like descending from Kunlun to the cinnabar field.\n*Winning over the small state*:\ngathering the cinnabar field’s metal-water,\nreversing its flow to the celestial valley.\nA small state humbling itself before a great state\nis like ascending from the cinnabar field to Kunlun.\n*Winning over the great state*:\nmerging Kunlun’s golden fluids,\nboth descending into the Yellow Court.\n\nThus, when Kunlun’s fluids flow down to the cinnabar field to generate qi,\ngathering the cinnabar field’s qi is *winning by humbling oneself*.\nOr when the cinnabar field’s qi ascends to Kunlun to generate fluids,\nswallowing Kunlun’s fluids is *winning by being humble*.\n\nThe *great state’s excess* is modeled on the Dao of the *Yi*.\nThe *Marsh Wind* hexagram is favorable for advancement,\nits image likening marsh water submerging wood—\nwhen marsh waters rise high,\nall trees are submerged,\nthis is the image of *Great Exceeding*.\nWhen Kunlun’s sweet dew descends,\nit originally advances with success,\naligning perfectly with *Great Exceeding*—\nspirit transforms into qi,\nand qi transforms into essence,\nwhich fills the cinnabar field.\nThus, it possesses the virtue of sheltering others.\n\nThe *small state’s modest success* is also modeled on the Dao of the *Yi*.\nThe *Thunder Mountain* hexagram is favorable for maintaining integrity,\nits image likening a bird’s lingering call—\njust as a flying bird should descend,\nso its call may be heard,\nthis is the image of *Small Exceeding*.\nWhen the lower cinnabar field’s true fluids are contained within,\noriginally maintaining integrity is auspicious,\naligning perfectly with *Small Exceeding*—\nessence generates qi,\nand qi generates spirit,\nwhich ascends to depend on the Yellow Court.\nThus, it possesses the Way of serving others.\n\nOne ascends and one descends, mutually supporting and preserving,\ninverting Heaven and Earth,\nreversing the flow of the Yellow River.\nThe wondrous secret of cultivating the body lies in nothing beyond this.\n\n**Supplementary Annotation:**\nThus, some say: \"When the Yellow Court resides below to gather the fluids of Kunlun, it is *taking by descending*.\"\nOthers say: \"When the Yellow Court illuminates below to absorb the qi of the cinnabar field, it is *taking by descending*.\"\nThis meaning may also be considered.\n\n**Wu Shan’s Commentary:**\nThe Yellow Court is the palace for nurturing the heart,\nwhile the *mysterious gate* is the source for nurturing the kidneys.\nNow, what nurtures the heart is called the *mysterious gate*—\nfor in preserving spirit and guarding essence, the Dao values stillness.\nIn congealing spirit and gathering qi, the Dao values softness.\nIn the empty spirit receiving qi, the Dao values humility.\nIn guarding spirit and awaiting qi, the Dao values weakness.\nIn spirit uniting with qi, the Dao values lowliness.\nIn harmonizing spirit and qi, the Dao values harmony.\nThe *mysterious gate* possesses the six virtues of stillness, softness, humility, weakness, lowliness, and harmony.\nThus, it borrows the name of the *mysterious gate* to provisionally replace the name of the Yellow Court—\nthis is not to move the gate’s location into the Yellow Court.\nThose who practice the elixir often invert the trigrams and lines of the hexagrams, frequently borrowing names from one another.\nWhen Hanxu speaks plainly, and Master Huidao further elucidates,\neach phrase is a true secret,\nsweeping away a thousand analogies.\nThose who attain it should treasure it; do not show it to the unworthy.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Two**\n*(He Shanggong’s edition titles this \"The Dao Chapter\"; Peng’s edition titles it

sitting and advancing in this Dao.\n\n*Sitting* means *guarding*. As in the *Zuozhuan*: \"The people of Chu *guarded* their northern gate.\"\nIt also means *kneeling*. As in the *Classic of Rites*: \"When *kneeling*, one shifts position.\"\n\nWhy was this Dao prized in ancient times?\nBecause by seeking it, one obtains it,\nand by obtaining it, one is absolved of guilt.\nThus, nothing under heaven is as precious as this.\n*\"Was it not said\"* is an archaic phrase meaning *\"Did the ancients not say?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Three**\n*(He Shanggong’s edition titles this \"Beginning with Grace\"; Peng’s edition titles it \"The Great Chapter\")*\n\nAct without acting,\nattend to affairs without affairs,\ntaste without tasting.\nRegard the great as small, the many as few,\nand repay resentment with virtue.\nAddress difficulties while they are easy,\nachieve greatness while it is small.\nThe difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy.\nThe great affairs of the world must arise from the small.\nThus, the sage never acts as great,\nand therefore accomplishes greatness.\n\nOne who makes promises lightly will surely lack trust;\none who treats things lightly will surely encounter many difficulties.\nThus, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult,\nand therefore ultimately encounters no difficulty.\n\n*Acting without acting*, *attending to affairs without affairs*, *tasting without tasting*—\nall refer to tranquility and simplicity.\n*Regarding the great as small, the many as few*—\nthis is impartiality in dealing with things.\n*Repaying resentment with virtue*—\nresponding with uprightness is itself repaying with virtue,\nnot adding extra generosity.\n\n*Addressing difficulties while they are easy*—\nwhen others treat things lightly, I alone treat them as difficult;\nthis is not putting the difficult before the easy.\n*Achieving greatness while it is small*—\ndisdaining small conduct will ultimately harm great virtue.\nThis aligns with the *Book of Documents*.\nThus, it is also said: \"The difficult affairs of the world must arise from the easy.\nThe great affairs of the world must arise from the small.\"\nThis is clearly understood.\n\n*Arising from the easy* begins with caution against treating things lightly.\n*Arising from the small* begins with valuing small conduct.\nThe sage never acts as great,\nand therefore accomplishes greatness—\nfurther clarifying that the above must *arise from the small*.\n\nTo emphasize that it must *arise from the easy*,\nanother argument is presented:\nFor example, one who makes promises lightly will surely become untrustworthy.\nThus, one who speaks lightly will surely end as one whose actions are difficult to accomplish.\nTherefore, the sage treats even the undifficult as difficult,\nand thus ultimately encounters no difficulty.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixty-Four**\n\nWhat is secure is easy to maintain;\nwhat has no sign is easy to plan for.\nWhat is fragile is easy to break;\nwhat is minute is easy to scatter.\nAct before things arise,\ngovern before disorder begins.\nA tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a tiny sprout.\nA nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth.\nA journey of a thousand *li* begins with a single step.\nOne who acts will fail;\none who grasps will lose.\nThe sage acts not, and thus does not fail.\nHe does not grasp, and thus does not lose.\n\nIn their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.\nIf one is as cautious at the end as at the beginning,\nthere will be no failure.\n\nThus, the sage desires what others do not desire,\nand does not value rare goods.\nHe learns what others do not learn,\nrestoring what the multitude has passed over,\nto assist the self-so of the ten thousand things without daring to act.\n\nFor those cultivating the great Dao:\nWhat is secure is easy to maintain—otherwise, when trouble arises, it is difficult to hold.\nWhat has no sign is easy to plan for—otherwise, when things have gone astray, it is difficult to plan.\nThe fragile is easy to break; the minute is easy to scatter—\nthis speaks of the difficulty of preserving the tender and the challenge of seizing the small.\n\nAt the stage of non-being, action ensures what is secure may be maintained, and what has no sign may be planned for. Governing before disorder arises ensures the fragile does not break and the minute does not scatter. How can one not be cautious in their method?\n\nMoreover, progress in skill must be gradual, lest there be cause for retreat. It is like a living tree, growing from small to great; like building a terrace, rising from low to high; like traveling a road, advancing from near to far. These are clear proofs.\n\nThose who act desire success but bring about failure. Those who grasp desire gain but incur loss. The sage, however, practices non-action. Yet even in non-action and non-grasping, one must remain unwavering from beginning to end to achieve completion.\n\nI have often observed foolish people undertaking tasks, many failing when near success. How can one not be as cautious at the end as at the beginning?\n\nOnly the sage desires what others do not desire—desiring, he cherishes the Dao; not desiring, he scorns goods and values virtue. And he learns what others do not learn—learning, he possesses method; not learning, he remains serene in non-action. This is how he reverses the excesses of the multitude, assisting the self-so principle of the ten thousand things without daring to act.\n\nAs stated in the fifty-seventh chapter: *\"I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves; I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves; I do nothing, and the people enrich themselves; I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves.\"* This is precisely the same principle.\n\nThe version of Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter on Pristine Virtue,\" while Peng’s version calls it the \"Chapter on the People’s Simplicity.\"\n\nThose adept in the Dao in ancient times did not seek to enlighten the people but instead to render them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin; governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing. To understand these two paths is to grasp the model. One who comprehends this model is said to possess mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue runs deep and far, reversing the course of things, and thus attaining great harmony.\n\nThe Dao does not value knowledge or discernment, for these diminish its undifferentiated wholeness; it values instead the state of not-knowing and not-discerning, thereby preserving its namelessness. Thus, those adept in the Dao do not seek to enlighten the people but to render them simple.\n\n“The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness” echoes the earlier saying: “When cunning and wisdom arise, great falsity follows.” “Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin” corresponds to: “The more meticulous the governance, the more deficient the people.” “Governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing” aligns with: “Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.”\n\nThese two paths—cleverness and non-cleverness—truly determine the state’s fortune or misfortune and serve as the model for governance. One who understands this may be called possessed of mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue sees profoundly, its radiance reaches far, appearing simple yet not simple, reversing the dullness of things. *Great harmony* means great transformation. Only through such mysterious virtue can one attain this great transformation.\n\nChapter Sixty-Six. (Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter on Putting Oneself Last,\" while Peng’s version calls it the \"Chapter on Excellence in Humility.\")\n\nThe reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they excel in staying low—thus they become kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, when the sage wishes to rise above the people, they must speak as though beneath them. When they wish to lead the people, they must place themselves behind. Thus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened; though they stand ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting them without weariness. Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.\n\nRivers and seas excel in staying low, so all streams flow toward them—hence they are called kings of the hundred valleys. This illustrates the sage. To rise above the people while speaking humbly is what was previously called “the high takes the low as its foundation.” To lead the people while placing oneself behind is what was previously called “putting oneself last, yet finding oneself first.” Thus, the sage’s virtue is empty and harmonious: standing above, they possess no awe-inspiring majesty, yet the people do not feign reverence; standing ahead, they carry no overbearing force, yet the people feel no need to guard against harm. Therefore, the world exalts the sage with joy and never tires of it. None can contend with them because the sage, like rivers and seas that excel in staying low, leaves the hundred valleys with no way to divide their power.\n\nChapter Sixty-Seven\n(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter on the Three Treasures,\" and Peng’s version concurs.)\n\nThe world all calls me great, yet I seem unworthy. Precisely because I am great, I seem unworthy. Were I worthy, I would long since have been small!\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish:\nThe first is compassion,\nThe second is frugality,\nThe third is not daring to be first in the world.\nThrough compassion, one can be courageous;\nThrough frugality, one can be expansive;\nThrough not daring to be first in the world, one can become the vessel of leadership.\n\nNow, to abandon compassion yet seek courage,\nTo abandon frugality yet seek expansion,\nTo abandon the last yet strive to be first—\nThis is the path to death.\n\nWith compassion, one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.\nHeaven will save them, shielding them with compassion.\n\nThe Dao is fundamentally without form or body, yet it is called great. If it had a form or body to imitate, it would no longer resemble its greatness. Only the great cannot be named as great, and so it does not resemble what people call great. If it resembled what people call great, then even the great would be small. Hence it is said, “Were it worthy, it would long since have been small!”\n\nThe highest speaks of the three treasures, which are but scattered manifestations of greatness:\nThe first is compassion—compassion must be resolute in benevolence, thus it can be courageous.\nThe second is frugality—frugality must excel in accumulation, thus it can be expansive.\nThe third is not daring to be first in the world—not daring to be first means great vessels mature late, thus one can become the vessel of leadership.\n\nYet to abandon compassion for courage is to harbor a heart of cruelty.\nTo abandon frugality for expansion is to harbor a heart of greed.\nTo abandon the last for the first is to harbor a heart of contention.\nAll these are paths to death.\n\nThough the three treasures are presented in order, the first is most noble, so compassion is emphasized to complete the discourse.\nWith compassion, one triumphs in battle—seeing righteousness, one must act.\nWith it, one stands firm in defense—preserving benevolence, one must be steadfast.\n“Saving them” refers to humanity: Heaven will save people, and it too must shield them with compassion.\n\nHow great is the Dao of compassion!\n\nChapter Sixty-Eight\n(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter on Matching Heaven,\" and Peng’s version concurs.)\n\nA masterful warrior is not martial.\nA masterful fighter is not enraged.\nA masterful conqueror does not contend.\nA masterful leader humbles himself before others.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThis is called the power of employing others,\nThis is called matching the ancient ultimate of Heaven.\n\nReliance on force is called martiality,\nReliance on qi is called rage,\nEngagement in slaughter is called contention—\nNone of these are the way of the masterful warrior, the masterful fighter, or the masterful conqueror.\n\nOf old, those who masterfully employed others,\nEven when facing a tiger-like general among their foes,\nWould always humble themselves to summon him,\nCausing him to lay down his armor and come in surrender.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nThat is, the power of employing others’ strength.\nMoreover, such virtue suffices to match Heaven,\nFor Heaven does not vie for merit yet accomplishes all,\nThe ancient ultimate indeed.\n\nThe esoteric meaning of this chapter,\nFor those who cultivate the elixir,\nSpeaks of taming the White Tiger by first subduing the True Dragon.\nFor the White Tiger is a creature difficult to restrain,\nAnd if the Dragon does not humble itself, the Tiger will surely flee.\nOnly when the self is refined without impurity\nCan one wield the Tiger’s power.\n\nChapter Sixty-Nine\n(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the \"Chapter on the Mysterious Application,\" and Peng’s version titles it the \"Chapter on Underestimating the Enemy.\")\n\nThe strategist has a saying:\n“I dare not act as host but as guest,\nDare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”\nThis is called marching without marching,\nRepelling without arms,\nEngaging without an enemy,\nWielding without weapons.\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.\nThus, when opposing forces clash,\nThe grieving side prevails.\n\nIn warfare, let the other be host while I remain guest,\nYielding to their challenge,\nThus able to rest while they toil,\nAdvancing an inch and retreating a foot.\nIf I allow them to pursue,\nI can then strike unexpectedly and capture them—\nThis is the subtle strategy of warfare.\n\n“Marching without marching” means having no feet:\nThe left step is *chì*, the right *chù*,\nWithout both feet, one cannot march.\n“Repelling without arms”—how can one repel without arms?\n“Engaging without an enemy”—*rēng* means mutual reliance;\nIf enemies rely on one another, without mutual engagement, there is no enmity.\nWeapons are instruments of advantage;\nThe warrior wields them to charge.\nWithout weapons, one cannot fight.\n\nNo misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy;\nUnderestimating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasure.\nThe greatest treasure is benevolence and righteousness.\nThus, when opposing forces clash,\nVictory must belong to the grieving side—\n“Grieving” echoes the previous chapter’s “compassion in battle.”\n\nThis chapter also contains the esoteric secret of the Returned Elixir,\nComparing warfare to tending the furnace.\n“I” refers to cinnabar:\nMy household’s cinnabar dare not act as host\nBut must enter the other’s jade pool,\nThere to refine true essence—\nThus, the other becomes host and I the guest,\nA reversal of host and guest.\n\n“Advancing and retreating” refer to firing times:\nAdvancing an inch and retreating a foot\nDoes not mean failing to apply fire,\nBut rather exercising caution in firing,\nFearing missteps in the process.\n\n“Marching without marching”—\nWords fail to communicate, kindness and authority do not reach.\n“Repelling without arms”—\nThe firing schedule is unclear, the matchmaker not yet found.\n“Engaging without an enemy”—\nDragon and Tiger are unbalanced, weights do not match.\n“Wielding without weapons”—\nThe talisman has not been transmitted, the medicinal ingredients not obtained.\nHow dare one tend the furnace and apply effort,\nRisking the loss of my treasure?\nMy treasure: cinnabar.\nMaster Zǐyáng said:\n*“When deploying troops, distinguish left and right armies*\n*(The Upper Yang commentary notes: left and right refer to the other and myself),*\n*Let them be host while I remain guest.*\n*I urge you: when facing battle, do not underestimate the enemy,*\n*Lest you forfeit my household’s priceless treasure.”*\nThis is the source of his meaning.\n\nWhen opposing forces clash—\nThat is, the other and myself face each other—\nIf I can use my inherent compassion and benevolence\nTo bind the other’s metal nature with compliant righteousness,\nThen metal will come to submit to wood,\nAnd I will surely prevail.\nThus it is said: the grieving side prevails.\nMaster Wúshān observes:\n*“The true secret is entirely found here—*\n*Where else would one seek immortal scriptures?”*\n\n**Chapter Seventy**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Knowing Difficulty,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on Knowing Me.”)*\n\nMy words are very easy to know,\nVery easy to practice.\nYet under Heaven none can know them,\nNone can practice them.\nWords have their ancestry,\nAffairs have their lord.\nIt is only through ignorance\nThat they do not know me.\nThose who know me are rare,\nThus I am esteemed.\nTherefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.\n\nThe Supreme’s words are all of the Dao,\nYet the Dao is not beyond the human body—\nThus it is easy to know, easy to practice.\nYet under Heaven, none can ultimately know or practice it,\nAs the *Doctrine of the Mean* says:\n*“The Way does not prevail—I know why:*\n*The wise overshoot it, the foolish do not reach it.”*\n*“The Way is not evident—I know why:*\n*The worthy overshoot it, the unworthy do not reach it.”*\nThus none can know or practice it.\n\nYet these words can serve as the origin of cultivation,\nAnd these affairs can set forth the guiding principles of life—\nThus they have their ancestry and their lord.\nThis is the profound meaning of the Supreme’s scripture.\nIt is only because people do not know this Dao\nThat they do not know the Supreme.\nThe Supreme says:\n*“Those who know me are rare,*\n*Thus I am esteemed.”*\nLike the sage who wears coarse cloth while holding jade:\nCoarse cloth is the garb of the lowly,\nWorn outwardly while fine jade is held within—\nEven if few know, the esteem is undiminished.\nThis is what is meant by *“withdrawing from the world without being seen,*\n*Knowing yet not regretting”—*\nOnly the sage can do this.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-One**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Knowing Illness,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on the Illness of Illness.”)*\n\nTo know yet seem not to know is supreme.\nNot to know yet claim to know is illness.\nOnly by regarding this illness as illness\nDoes one avoid illness.\nThe sage is not ill\nBecause he regards illness as illness—\nThus he is not ill.\n\nTo know what others do not know\nIs to have a clear Dao and manifest virtue—\nThus it is supreme.\nTo feign knowledge where there is none\nBrings great harm to the self—\nThus it is called illness.\nOnly by regarding the illness of feigned knowledge as a grievous affliction\nCan one be free of the illness of feigned knowledge—\nThus one avoids illness.\nThe sage’s freedom from illness\nFollows the same principle.\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Two**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this the “Chapter on Loving the Self,” and Peng’s version titles it the “Chapter on Fearing Authority.”)*\n\nWhen the people do not fear authority,\nThen authority arrives.\nDo not constrict their dwelling,\nDo not stifle their livelihood.\nIt is only by not stifling\nThat one is not stifled.\nThus the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nTherefore he discards that and takes this.\n\nAuthority possesses the qi of stern severity;\nIf the people do not fear authority,\nHeaven will magnify its severity.\nYet Heaven fundamentally favors life and dislikes killing—\nIt is people who bring killing upon themselves.\nThus one must not constrict their dwelling\nNor stifle their livelihood.\n\n“Constrict” means to narrow;\n“Dwelling” is the abode of spirit.\n“Stifle” means to cut off;\n“Livelihood” is the mechanism of qi.\nOne should broaden the abode to settle the spirit,\nExtend the mechanism to guide the qi.\nOnly by not cutting off the qi\nCan one nurture it without cessation.\n\nOnly the sage knows himself but does not display himself,\nLoves himself but does not exalt himself.\nKnowing himself, he retreats into solitude and self-vigilance,\nDaring not flaunt himself before others.\n\nSelf-love places preservation and nurturance above all,\nDaring not to boast or exalt oneself before others.\nThus one discards the heart of self-display and self-exaltation,\nAnd embraces the heart of self-knowledge and self-love—\nAll centered on the earnest care of one’s own person.\n\nChapter Seventy-Three\nCourage in daring leads to death;\nCourage in not daring leads to life.\nThese two—one brings benefit, the other harm.\nWho knows the reason for Heaven’s aversion?\nEven the sage finds this difficult.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven:\nThough it does not contend, it excels in victory;\nThough it does not speak, it excels in response;\nThough not summoned, it comes of itself,\nSerene yet excelling in strategy.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nSparse yet nothing slips through.\n\n*Courage* means resoluteness.\n*Death* means the reckless heart is extinguished.\n*Life* means the primordial spirit is revived.\nTo extinguish the reckless heart requires decisiveness—hence one must dare.\nTo revive the primordial spirit requires gradual cultivation—hence one must not dare.\nBetween death and life, harm contains benefit—dying to the heart revives the spirit.\nBenefit contains harm—reviving the spirit first requires dying to the heart.\nThus it is said: “One brings benefit, the other harm,”\nFor benefit and harm complement each other.\nWithin this lies the Dao of Heaven.\n\nHeaven has its likes and dislikes,\nSilently meting out punishment and virtue,\nYet mortals struggle to fathom its reasons.\nTo speak only of its aversion:\nThe azure vault’s fundamental nature favors life,\nYet its killing mechanism remains inscrutable.\nThus even the sage, when speaking of Heaven’s Dao,\nDoes not dare to treat it lightly.\n\nWhat is the Dao of Heaven like?\nIt does not dispute with mortals over right and wrong,\nYet in matters of length and brevity, it prevails.\nIt does not preach goodness to mortals,\nYet when fortune and misfortune arrive, all respond.\nUnsummoned, it comes of itself,\nSerene yet excelling in strategy.\nThis describes how swiftly or slowly, well or ill,\nRewards and punishments are meted out—\nApplied to each person without the slightest error.\n\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nSparse yet nothing slips through—\nHow great and dense is its encompassing!\nThose who cultivate themselves\nMust steadfastly uphold their virtue to align with Heaven.\n\nChapter Seventy-Four\nIf the people do not fear death,\nHow can one threaten them with death?\nIf the people were always to fear death,\nThen for those who act strangely,\nI could seize and execute them—who would dare?\nYet there is always one who executes.\nTo execute in place of the executor\nIs like hewing wood in place of the master carpenter.\nFew who hew in place of the master carpenter\nDo not injure their own hands.\n\nIf the people do not fear death, they will not dread execution—\nWhy then threaten them further with death?\nIf the people’s hearts always harbored a fear of death,\nThen among the multitude, only those who act strangely\nCould be seized and executed—who would dare grow complacent in their ways and defy death?\nConfucius once said to Ji Kangzi:\n“In governing, why resort to execution? If you desire goodness, the people will be good.”\nWhen he later served in Lu, he executed only one man, Shaozheng Mao,\nTo strike awe into all who acted strangely—this was his intent.\nOnly thus could he be called a *heavenly officer*.\nA *heavenly officer* is one who executes—\nHeaven has its executor to eliminate the strange and perverse,\nSo that no one usurps the power of execution.\n\nTo forcibly take the place of the executor in carrying out executions\nIs like replacing the master carpenter in hewing wood.\nFew who replace the master carpenter in hewing\nDo not injure their own hands.\nThus we know that few who replace the executor in executing\nDo not injure their own benevolent heart.\nWhy resort to execution?\nIt is better to lead the people through goodness.\n\nNote: *Resorting to execution* implies a deliberate intent to kill.\n*Not resorting to execution* implies the absence of such intent.\nIf one aligns one’s spirit with uprightness,\nAll deviant forces will not dare to encroach—\nThis is the secret of effortless, virtuous execution.\n\nChapter Seventy-Five\n\nThe people’s hunger arises from their superiors consuming excessive taxes—this is why they hunger. The people’s unruliness arises from their superiors’ meddling—this is why they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life’s comforts—this is why they disregard death. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to are wiser than those who prize life.\n\nWhen superiors consume excessive taxes, the people’s famine arises. When superiors meddle excessively, the people’s unruliness becomes evident. The people’s disregard for death stems from their greed for wealth and profit, their desire to enrich their lives—thus they treat their bodies lightly, heedless of danger. As the saying goes, “Men die for wealth”—this is the case. Only those who do not value wealth and profit highly maintain a clear mind and few desires, and they are wiser than those who prize life.\n\n*My humble note: Excessive taxes starve the people, just as overtaxing the body with labor leads to withering. Excessive meddling makes governance difficult, just as overusing the spirit leads to chaos.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Against Strength”; Peng’s version titles it “On Abiding Above”)*\n\nWhen people are alive, they are supple and soft; when dead, they are rigid and hard. When the myriad things—plants and trees—are alive, they are tender and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the rigid and hard are companions of death; the supple and soft are companions of life. Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail; when a tree is hard, it will be felled. The strong and great dwell below; the soft and weak dwell above.\n\nThe supple and weak pertain to *qi*; the rigid and hard pertain to bone. When *qi* gathers and the body harmonizes, there is life; when *qi* scatters and bones stand alone, there is death. The life and death of the myriad things follow this pattern. When tender and fragile, water-*qi* is abundant—thus life. When withered and dry, water-*qi* is exhausted—thus death. Rigidity and hardness are tied to death; suppleness and softness are tied to life. Should one rely solely on the easily visible forms and appearances to understand this?\n\nConsider further the analogy: When an army is strong but does not prevail, its *qi* has already declined while the enemy’s *qi* is still flourishing. When a tree is hard, its joints knot—its hard *qi* cannot flow, and its growth halts at the size of a hand’s span. Thus, the distinction between above and below is also determined by rigidity and softness. In cultivating the self, can one not regard humility and harmony as paramount?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “The Dao of Heaven”; Peng’s version concurs)*\n\nIs not the Dao of Heaven like the drawing of a bow? What is high is pressed down; what is low is lifted up. What has excess is reduced; what is deficient is supplemented. The Dao of Heaven reduces excess to supplement deficiency. The Dao of man is not so—it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world? Only those who possess the Dao.\n\nThus, the sage acts without relying on his actions, accomplishes without dwelling on his achievements—does he not wish to display his worth? The highest teaching speaks in plain terms: The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow, its essence lying in balance and uprightness. Press down the high, lift up the low—then both arms are level. Reduce excess, supplement deficiency—then the body is aligned. The Dao of Heaven’s marvel in harmonizing the seven celestial bodies and ordering the five phases lies precisely in its balance and uprightness. Hence it is said: “The Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency.”\n\nThe Dao of man is otherwise: it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive, causing the deficient to become even more deficient and the excessive even more excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world’s deficiencies? Only those who embody Heaven’s Dao and desire that all things attain their proper place—such is the sage. He acts without reliance, accomplishes without dwelling, reduces his excess to serve the world without claiming virtue—does he not avoid displaying his worth?\n\n*Vulgar annotation in verse:*\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the full and humility receives benefit;\nHuman nature consumes the meager, and loss brings greater misfortune.\nIf one can grasp the meaning of this classic,\nThe elixir of gold and cinnabar aligns with the sagely lineage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Trust and Responsibility”; Peng’s version titles it “Softness and Weakness”)*\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong, the soft overcomes the rigid, is known to all under Heaven, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says: “One who bears the state’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain. One who bears the state’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem paradoxical.\n\nThese three lines echo the earlier saying: “The softest under Heaven rides roughshod over the hardest under Heaven.” Nothing can replace it—no other thing can substitute for this power to attack the hard. That softness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength is a principle all know, yet none ultimately practice. Thus, the Supreme again cites the sage’s words to illustrate the great virtue of softness and weakness.\n\nBearing the state’s disgrace, bearing the state’s misfortune—these are the sage’s self-assumed burdens, as in: “I alone am at fault; what guilt have the people? My virtue is meager and thin; Heaven inflicts this calamity.” That “straightforward words seem paradoxical” means that the sage’s true words all turn inward, never blaming others. This, too, is the Dao of softness and weakness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Fulfilling Agreements”; Peng’s version concurs)*\n\nReconciling great resentment inevitably leaves residual bitterness—how can this be called true goodness? Thus, the sage holds the left tally and makes no demands upon others. Those with virtue oversee the contract; those without virtue enforce scrutiny. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good.\n\nWhen the myriad regions brim with resentment, the ruler’s virtue must be meager. To encounter the people’s grievances and still refuse self-reproach, instead seeking to reconcile great resentment—even if reconciliation succeeds, unresolved bitterness remains within, and residual grievance cannot be dispelled. How can this be deemed perfect goodness? Confucius said: “Be severe with oneself and lenient toward others, and resentment will stay far away.” Thus, the sage governs the world by cultivating the virtue of self-rigor, earning the people’s trust. Without demanding of others, the people naturally place their faith in him. It is like a contract split into left and right halves, each party holding one as perpetual proof—then you harbor no deceit toward me, and I harbor no suspicion toward you. The sage holds virtue as one holds the left tally; how could the people not rejoice? Therefore, those with virtue oversee the contract, while those without virtue enforce scrutiny. *Scrutiny* means examining faults. To be meticulous in fault-finding while never reflecting on oneself is to act in a way the people will not follow.\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good. As the *Book of Documents* says: “August Heaven has no favorites; it befriends those who revere it. The people have no constant allegiance; they cleave to those who are humane.”\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Standing Alone”; Peng’s version titles it “Small States”)*\n\nLet the state be small, its people few. Though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men, let them not use them. Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to deploy them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use.\n\nLet them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, contentment in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nIf there be those who wish to enlarge the state and multiply its people, let them possess tools for a hundred million yet not use them—surely their sufficiency will be all the greater. This is to emulate the return to antiquity and the restoration of primal simplicity.\n\nThe Supreme One does not act thus. He takes the small to exemplify the great, so that from the small, the great may be known. When a state is small and its people few, though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men and do not use them, their sufficiency will only increase. What difficulty is there in returning to unadorned simplicity? Thus, he lets the people not use their tools, treasuring only their own lives. Let them dwell in their native land and not migrate elsewhere. Let them hold death in awe and not die, nurture life and live long—what more could they seek beyond this?\n\nIn such a time, the people of the state walk with light and vigorous steps, so though they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them. Within the state’s borders, there are no thieves or bandits, so though they have armor and weapons, they do not deploy them. The governance of the state is simple and unadorned, so the practice of knotting cords may continue. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure dwellings, and joyful customs—neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another. Thus, social obligations are few, and extravagance does not arise; material goods are abundant, and each family dwells in peace.\n\nThe lofty ones of the state say: “A single hill, a single ravine—we deem ourselves beyond the mortal world. A spring, an autumn—we seem to forget time within a gourd. Grandparents and parents live long in health; husbands and wives remain together for life. Brothers and sisters play the *xun* and *chi* in harmony; children and grandchildren train phoenixes and cranes. How is this different from the grotto heavens and blessed lands, the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss?”\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Revealing Simplicity”; Peng’s version titles it “Non-Accumulation”)*\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate. The more he does for others, the more he possesses; the more he gives to others, the more he has. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm. The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\nTruth, goodness, and wisdom all pertain to establishing words. This passage concludes the entire scripture’s meaning. Sincere discourse is simply genuine, not embellished to please the world. Those who seek to please the world employ embellishment, not sincerity—hence: “Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful.” The excellence of inherited teachings is simply correctness, not contrived to confuse others. Those who seek to confuse others employ contrivance, not proper transmission—hence: “The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.” Penetrating writings are simply coherent, not overflowing to display talent. Those who seek to display talent overflow without restraint, not truly penetrating—hence: “The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.”\n\nThis is followed by establishing virtue and merit to fulfill the great function of this scripture. *Accumulation* means accumulating goodness. The sage does not speak of accumulating goodness but establishes his own great merit and virtue. Thus, his merit is boundless, his virtue all-encompassing. By acting for others through merit and virtue, he gains ever more; by bestowing merit and virtue upon others, he possesses ever more.\n\nThe Dao operates silently to generate and complete, thus it benefits without harming. The Way of the sage works with effortless spontaneity, not contending with others in accumulating good deeds—thus its greatness equals that of Heaven. As the ancient saying goes: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, the next establish words—all three are imperishable.” This may serve as a colophon for this text.\n\nAfter completing his commentary on this scripture, Master Hanxu reflected and pondered, aligning words with deeds, and declared that though he did not rely on written words, he had expressed the true mechanism. The final chapter’s commentary concludes with merit and virtue, which he deemed fine and good. Yet upon further reflection, he wondered how the four characters “acts and does not contend” could serve as the root of the eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: “Yes, yes—this single phrase is the very keystone of the entire scripture!”\n\nThe dread of cultivators lies in hearing the Dao yet still vying for petty merit, petty virtue, petty literary fame, or chasing after all ephemeral riches and honors—thus squandering their vital essence in vain. The sagely Dao aligns with the celestial Dao; the celestial Dao governs generation and completion, inherently beneficial and never harmful. Does not the sagely Dao likewise oversee creation, equally beneficial and never harmful? My wish is that those who achieve merit and fame, fulfill filial piety and loyalty, may each dwell in truth and each attain the Dao. First, practice the work of jade refinement, concealing oneself amidst the marketplace. Next, undertake the labor of gold refinement, dwelling deep in mountain valleys. Within, fulfill what must be done; without, extinguish all thoughts of contention. Only through non-contention can none in the world contend with one—such is the perfected person. The great conclusion of the sacred scripture reaches its utmost here.\n\n*The Authentic Transmission of Laozi*\nLaozi was a native of Chu. His father, Qianganyuan Gao, served as Senior Censor of Shang (alternatively, Zhou). He married Lady Hong, whose given name was Yingfu. One day, as she napped, she saw a five-colored radiance cradling the Supreme Old Lord descending from the heavens, suddenly transforming into a shooting star that flew into her mouth. There it congealed into a jade-like embryo, and after twelve years, she gave birth beneath a plum tree in Quren Village, Lai District, Ku County. Thus, he took Li as his surname. Because he was born after dreaming of the Old Lord, he was called Laozi; because his ears were long, he was named Chong’er and styled Baiyangfu. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month in the first year of King Wuding of Shang.\n\n*(The above is recorded in the Immortal Scriptures and the* Lu Shi. *The* Nei Zhuan *states: “His surname was Li, his given name Er. His mother saw the essence of the sun descend like a shooting star, entering her mouth, and thus conceived. She carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth beneath a plum tree by the Guo River in Chen. Pointing to the plum tree, she said, ‘This shall be my surname.’ Born with white hair, he was called Laozi. As his ears had three openings, he was also called Lao Dan.” The* Wu Zong Wang Ji *records: “His surname was Li, his given name Zai, born on the fourteenth day of the ninth month in the year Dingsi of King Ding.” The* Yue Ling Guang Yi *states: “The Jade Maiden was Laozi’s mother. She dreamed of a five-colored radiance forming like a pellet, flowing into her mouth, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After eighty-one years of pregnancy, she rested beneath a date tree and gave birth by splitting open her left armpit. This occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month in the first year of Wuding.”)*\n\nThe *Suo Sui Qianliang Lu* states: “Qian Yuan Gao, at seventy-two years of age, remained unwed. He formed a union with his neighbor’s wife, the Lady of Extended Longevity, and after eighty years of pregnancy, she gave birth.”\n\nThe *Youyang Zazu* records: “Li’s mother was the Primordial Lady. The essence of the sun entered her mouth, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After seventy-two years, she gave birth.”\n\nLiu Xie’s *Xin Lun* says: “Laozi was conceived by the influence of a fire star.”\n\nThe *Lu Shi* recounts: “Conceived by a shooting star’s shock, he was born after twelve years. At birth, he could speak, his face golden and hair white—hence called Laozi. His village was in Lai Township of Ku, where ‘lai’ means ‘goosefoot,’ so he was also called Lao Laizi.”\n\nThe *Gao Shi Zhuan* notes: “Laozi was born during the Yin dynasty.”\n\nThe *Shen Xian Zhuan* relates: “Laozi’s name was Chong’er. His mother conceived after sensing a great shooting star. Some say she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth. Others claim his mother was unwed, and Laozi was her maternal surname. Still others say his mother happened upon a plum tree and gave birth beneath it. At birth, he could speak and, pointing to the plum tree, said, ‘Let this be my surname.’”\n\nThe *Lie Xian Zhuan* states: “Laozi entered his mother’s womb riding a white deer.”\n\nThe *Tang Ji* records: “Laozi’s mother conceived after eating a plum. His parents abandoned him, and after eighty years, he was born beneath a plum tree. Emperor Gaozu of Tang traced his lineage to Laozi, hence the phrase ‘the immortal plum roots entwine.’”\n\nThe *Za Zu* says: “The Mysterious Wondrous Jade Maiden descended with a cloud of dark and yellow qi, which she swallowed and thus conceived. After three thousand seven hundred years, she gave birth in the kingdom of Xina. This pertains to the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue, not Laozi.”\n\nUtterly filial by nature, he transformed the customs of Lai.\n\nFrom birth, he was serene and free of desire, outwardly forsaking glory and splendor, inwardly cultivating essence and qi. Through the transition from Shang to Zhou, he endured for centuries without decline, earning the name of an ancient recluse.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian* states: “He lived to be over one hundred sixty years old, or perhaps over two hundred.” Ge Hong said: “Laozi remained in the Zhou court for over three hundred years.” The *Lu Shi* records: “His mother lived to be four hundred forty, or perhaps two hundred twenty.” The *Extensive Records* says: “He lived two hundred seventy years.” The *Shantang Sikao* claims: “Born in the reign of King Wuding of Yin, he lived until the ninth year of the First Emperor of Qin, spanning nine hundred ninety-six years.” Yet reckoning from the first year of Wuding to the ninth year of the First Emperor yields one thousand eighty-seven years in total.\n\nDuring his time in Zhou, Laozi often changed his name. In the reign of King Wen, he was called Xieyi Zi (or Zhi Yi Xiansheng) and served as Archivist of the Royal Treasury. Under King Wu, he was called Yucheng Zi and served as the Chronicler Beneath the Pillar. In the reign of King Kang, he was called Guoshu Zi, and under King Qing, he was called Lao Laizi. His wife was profoundly wise, and together with Lao Laizi, they withdrew to live among the mulberry fields and plows.\n\nHe composed a work in fifteen chapters expounding the application of the Daoist arts. When King Zhuang of Chu heard of him, he sought to compare himself to Laozi. At the time, Lao Laizi was weaving, and the king approached to ask, “I wish to govern the state—may you assist me in this?” Laozi replied, “Very well.” The king then departed.\n\nWhen his wife returned from gathering firewood, she asked, “Did you give him your consent?” He replied, “I did.” His wife said, “I have heard that ‘those who may be fed with wine and meat may be followed with whips and cudgels; those who may be granted office and emolument may be followed with axes and halberds.’ I cannot bear to be controlled by others.” She cast aside her basket and left. Overjoyed, Lao Laizi immediately fled with his wife.\n\nSima Qian records: “Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang; Wang’s son was Yan; Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son, Jie, became Grand Tutor to the Prince of Jiaoxi and settled his family in Qi.” At that time, their ancestors and descendants, fathers and sons, must have wandered without fixed abode, branching into separate lineages.\n\nSome say: in Yue he was Fan Li; in Qi, the leather sack (Chiyi); in Wu, Tao Zhugong; in the early Han, the Yellow Stone Master; and in the reign of Emperor Wen, the Master by the River. All these remain unfathomable.\n\nGe Zhichuan states: Laozi appeared in every age, repeatedly changing his name. The reason, according to the *Nine Palaces*, *Three and Five Classics*, and *Yuanchen Jing*, is that each person encounters calamitous conjunctions in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the transformations of primordial qi, thereby transcending misfortune and prolonging life. Many Daoist practitioners today follow this practice. Laozi remained in Zhou for several hundred years, during which he must have faced more than one such conjunction, hence his many names. To properly establish the truth of Laozi’s life, one should rely primarily on historical records and verified accounts, cross-referencing them with Laozi’s esoteric scriptures. Other popular tales are largely fictitious.\n\nFurthermore, the *Western Ascension’s Central Embryo*, *Returning Mandate’s Essence*, *Pearl Strategem and Jade Mechanism*, and *Golden Internal Classic* all describe Laozi as having a pale yellow complexion, fine brows and a broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, spaced teeth and a square mouth, thick lips, a forehead marked with three or five lines of insight, sun-like temples and moon-like brows, a nose with pure bone and twin pillars, ears with three passages, feet bearing the pattern of two and five, hands grasping the ten celestial stems, a height of nine feet, and sixty-eight teeth—such was the countenance of a sage. Those who receive the Mandate of Heaven possess divine foresight and differ from ordinary people, destined to become masters of the Dao. Thus, they are aided by celestial spirits and followed by immortals. For this reason, the methods he transmitted for transcending the world numbered nine hundred and thirty scrolls, and his talismanic writings seventy scrolls—all recorded in the central chapters of *Laozi’s Original Account*. The catalogues still exist and can be verified. Works not included in these numbers were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not authentic texts (as noted by Zhichuan).\n\nLaozi embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification (*Records of the Grand Historian*). He devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of longevity, and though he remained in Zhou for a long time, his rank and position never advanced. This was because he sought to harmonize with the world while inwardly preserving his natural essence. Only after attaining the Dao did he depart—truly an immortal (*Biographies of Divine Transcendents*).\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Zhou to inquire about ritual from Laozi, Laozi said, “The man of whom you speak—his flesh and bones have long since decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person finds the right moment, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that ‘the good merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and the noble person of great virtue appears foolish.’ Rid yourself of your arrogance and excessive desires, your affected demeanor and reckless ambitions—none of these benefit you.”\n\nOne day, Laozi asked Confucius, “Have you attained the Dao?”\n\nConfucius said, “I have sought it for twenty-seven years and still have not attained it.”\nLaozi said, “If the Dao could be offered to others, then none would fail to offer it to their lord. If the Dao could be presented to others, then none would fail to present it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, then none would fail to tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then none would fail to transmit it to their children. Yet it cannot be done—there is no other reason: without an inner master, the Dao cannot reside within.”\n\nWhen Confucius visited Laozi and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, Laozi said, “Chaff in the eyes makes the four directions seem displaced. Mosquitoes and gadflies biting the skin keep one awake all night. Now, benevolence and righteousness assail my heart and mind with such vehemence—no greater disorder exists! You, sir, should let the world not lose its uncarved simplicity, move with the wind, stand by embracing virtue, and return together to the natural—what need is there to act so strenuously, as if carrying a great drum in search of a lost child? The swan does not bathe daily to remain white, nor does the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. The natural black and white are not sufficient to distinguish beauty from ugliness. Unadorned observation does not expand one’s fundamental nature. When the spring dries up, fish find themselves on dry land, where they moisten one another with breath and foam—yet how much better to forget one another in rivers and lakes!”\n\nConfucius said to Laozi, “I have studied the *Book of Songs*, the *Book of Documents*, the rites, music, the *Changes* and its images, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*—using them to seek audience with seventy-two lords.”\n\nDebating the Way of the former kings and elucidating the traces of Zhou and Shao—yet not a single ruler could put them to use. How difficult it is to persuade others, and how hard to clarify the Dao! ”\n\nLaozi said, “The *Six Classics* are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of now are still only traces. Footprints are what shoes produce, yet are footprints the shoes themselves? ”\n\nConfucius returned home and for three days did not speak. Zilu, finding this strange, asked him about it. Confucius said, “Of birds, I know they can fly. Of fish, I know they can swim. Of beasts, I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim with lines, those that fly with arrows. But as for the dragon, I know not how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the nine heavens. Today, having seen Laozi, is he not like the dragon? ”\n\nLaozi dwelt in Zhou for many years. Seeing the virtue of Zhou in decline, he then rode a black ox cart westward through the Qin Pass to ascend Kunlun. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi, having observed the purple qi, knew in advance of his coming and swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. Soon after, Laozi indeed arrived. Yin Xi said, “Master, you are about to withdraw from the world—pray compose a book for me.” Thereupon, Laozi halted his carriage at the pass and wrote the *Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand characters, imparting it fully to Yin Xi before departing.\n\nDuring the Eastern Han, in Qingzhou there was a man of the Wang clan named Cheng, styled Xuanfu, with the Daoist name Donghua. He encountered the Queen Mother of the West, Wang Qizhu. Pleased by their shared surname, she bestowed upon him the title *Supreme Perfected of White Clouds* and transmitted to him Laozi’s *Azure Talismans and Jade Scriptures*, along with the *Golden Regulations and Numinous Writings*. Xuanfu practiced diligently for three years without slackening. Moved by his devotion, Laozi descended and condensed the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* into a single scroll, naming it the *Outer Radiance*, which he imparted to Xuanfu for cultivation, along with the nine revolutions and eight jade elixir’s firing times. Xuanfu then concealed his brilliance, built a hermitage, and refined himself in seclusion. Upon achieving perfection, he was titled the *Lord Emperor Donghua*, governing the lesser yang qi of the East. He was also called the *Lesser Yang of the Purple Palace* and the *Great Emperor of Fusang*, serving as a minister and assistant. After three transmissions, it reached the Pure Yang Master, who said: “Laozi’s *Outer Radiance* and the Jade Emperor’s *Inner Radiance* are both preserved in the Fusang Palace. The Donghua Patriarch extolled and transmitted them, thereby revealing Laozi’s intent to deliver the world.”\n\nNow, Laozi’s former incarnation was as the Most High Lord Lao, and thus his concealments and transformations were as one with the Lord Lao. In high antiquity, the Lord Lao first manifested as the Three Purities. During the era of the Heavenly Sovereign, he changed his name to the *Celestial Master of Myriad Laws*; during the Earthly Sovereign’s time, to the *Mysterious Center Master*; during the Human Sovereign’s time, to *Master Unyielding*. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the *Golden Gate Lord Emperor*. In the time of Fuxi, he was *Yu Hua* (later changed to *Yu Mi*); during Shennong’s reign, *Old Master of Nine Spirits*; under Emperor Ku, *Lu Tu*; in the time of Yao, *Master of Accomplishment*; under Shun, *Master Yin Shou*; during the Xia of Yu, *Master True Conduct*; and in the Shang of Tang, *Master Bestowed Principle*. By the reign of King Wuding of Shang, he first descended in full spirit as Laozi—this was a time of opening a new phase and re-creating heaven and earth.\n\nLater generations, not understanding, conflated the Lord Lao with Laozi, thus merging the deeds of his former incarnation with his later one. Some claim Laozi existed before heaven and earth, others that he was the essence and spirit of heaven. Those who seek the truth sigh at such vagueness, for these accounts do not appear in the *Authentic Scripture of the Old Immortal*. *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: “Where there is heavenly virtue, there is the arts of the Dao. The adepts of the Dao—when have they ever been absent? From the times of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor down to the Three Dynasties, those who manifested the arts of the Dao have appeared in every age. Why must it always be the same Laozi?” This is all due to later students who, fond of the marvelous and valuing the extraordinary, sought to exalt Laozi and thus fabricated such tales. In truth, Laozi was merely one who attained the Dao with exceptional precision—nothing divine or strange.\n\nWhy? If Laozi is said to have attained the Dao, then others may strive to emulate him. But if he is deemed divine and strange, then immortality becomes unattainable. In my humble view, the Lord Lao in earlier times was divine and strange, while Laozi in later times was like other men. What is divine and strange cannot be learned, but what is like other men can be. My intent, Zhichuan, is only to follow the factual evidence.\n\nThe Confucians say that the birth of sages arises from human qi and endows heavenly essence—this is most fitting. Laozi’s bodily existence borrowed the four great elements to form his shape. Through refined cultivation and grand endeavor, he became the model for divine immortals, the patriarch of virtue and the Dao’s tradition. When his merit was complete and his conduct fulfilled, he returned to the assembly of all heavens. Dispersed, he becomes myriad; united, he is one. His divided spirits descend into the world, all taking cultivation of the Dao as their foundation. What cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi, Dongfang Shuo, and the like, who are said to be Laozi under different names—these claims are unreliable, for they were merely those to whom Laozi granted gifts. The *Treasure Eulogy* says: “Those who produced Zhuangzi of the Mulberry Grove and Dongfang Shuo discerned subtle traces like cinnabar.” This is akin to the mother of Danyang, who dreamed of receiving a divine cinnabar script and gave birth to a great immortal. The *Immortals’ Biographies* state: “Those who follow Laozi’s teachings are all pure, empty, tranquil, and uncontentious, thus able to conceal jade within coarse robes and remain unshaken in perilous times.” Its source is deep and its flow vast—could this not be the teacher and model for all ages, as ordained by heaven and earth?\n\nHaving dwelt in Qingdao for several years, I once instructed the latecomers Zhu, Jiecheng Li, and Huifeng Liu in Laozi’s method of purity and stillness. I was ever cautious and reverent, never daring to forget the ancestral teachings.\n\nBefore was the Lord Lao, after was Laozi—are they one or two? Their harmony and distinction are perfectly clear.\n\nThe literary style of this text is like flowing water today and the former incarnation of the bright moon. (Wushan) interweaves narrative and discourse, blending history with profundity. The collected biographies of various masters all distill the finest essence. This is the first precious transmission of Laozi’s tradition.\n\n*(Baohe)*\n*Categorized Explications of the* Yin Fu Jing\n*Composed by Shuxia Hanxu*\n\n**Preface to the** *Explication of the* Yin Fu Jing\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* establishes the methods of cultivation and refinement upon the principles of the Three Powers and the foundation of the myriad transformations. It is as if it were the primordial text since the opening of heaven and earth, for all it speaks of is the natural. Some say it is a work from the late Zhou or Warring States period, confined merely to the mechanisms of theft, life, and death. They suspect it of being bizarre and extraordinary, unaware that its principles are in truth level and upright. Some claim it was authored by Li Quan of the Daguanzi, and if Quan could speak thus, I would rank him alongside Guangcheng. Others say Guangcheng was Laozi’s former incarnation in the era of qi-transformation and should not have spoken in such terms. Little do they realize that the ancient was also heaven and earth, and the present is also heaven and earth; the ancient was also sun and moon, and the present is also sun and moon. Yet this text was obtained from the Tiger’s Mouth Crag on Mount Song, and only emerged in the Tang dynasty. Since the time of the Yellow Emperor, thousands of years had passed, so later generations could not but harbor doubts. Quan encountered the Old Mother of Mount Li, who transmitted to him the profound meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*. She admonished him: “The *Yin Fu Jing* contains over three hundred characters: a hundred expound the Dao, a hundred expound the arts, and the three are interwoven as one. Above lies the Way of divine immortals embracing the One; in the middle, the methods for enriching the state and pacifying the people; below, the techniques for strengthening the army and securing victory. These are no empty words.”\n\nThe terms \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower\" do not refer to the names of three chapters but rather to three levels of meaning. These three are interwoven and blended within the text, recurring and unfolding subtly throughout its passages—precisely what is meant by \"interweaving the three and merging them as one.\"\n\nDaoist adepts regard \"strengthening the army and securing victory\" as matters pertaining to the refinement of the elixir and the upward ascent of the Dao. Why, then, is it labeled as the \"lower\" level? Laozi said: *\"Fine weapons are an inauspicious qi; they are used only when there is no other choice.\"* In my earlier commentary on the *Daode Jing*, I mistakenly received the approval of a sagely teacher. Recently, upon continuing with the *Yin Fu Jing*, I admired its brevity of text, its profound intent, and how each character cuts to the essence of secret alchemical language. Thus, I once more settled my mind to observe things clearly and composed this commentary to elucidate its meaning.\n\n*Preface by Juanshi Shanren Huoxi Yue on the Great River*\n\nPeople know the divine as divine but do not understand why the non-divine is divine. I observe Hanxu—his appearance is that of a fool, and others take him for one. Yet I do not. When Hanxu annotated the *Daode Jing*, the *Qingjing Jing*, the *Dingguan Jing*, and the *Wuchu Jing*, people marveled at him, but I did not. Recently, upon contemplating the heavens and discerning the \"Five Thieves,\" examining the earth and discussing the pacification of the people—principles for a peaceful populace and a prosperous state, techniques for strengthening the army and securing victory—all were expounded in his commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing*. From this, even I cannot fathom the depths of Hanxu’s wisdom.\n\nThe *Preface* asserts that *\"since the beginning of creation, there must have been writing\"* and vigorously defends its antiquity, demonstrating both talent and insight. The *Yin Fu Jing* emerged in the time of the Yellow Emperor, after the slaughter of Chiyou. The Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, who transmitted this text to him. Silently observing the ministers at court—such as Feng Hou, Li Mu, Qi Bo, Tongjun, Dou Bao, and Da Nao—all of whom understood the mechanisms of killing, the cycles of life and death, and the workings of the *jiazi* calendar, Guangchengzi surveyed them and spoke in cryptic, perilous language, concealing within it a path of perfect clarity. His intent was for all in the Yellow Emperor’s retinue to hear this wondrous teaching. To enlighten the Yellow Emperor was to enlighten his ministers—how vast was Guangchengzi’s true capacity!\n\nConfucians of the Three Dynasties and later have doubted whether this is a text from before the Three Dynasties, but their skepticism merely skims the surface of its words. Suppose there were an elixir of immortality brought to market for sale. If one falsely claimed it was rat poison, or even said it could cure illness, people would surely dismiss and ridicule it, perhaps even revile it, for how could a poison also heal? Yet those with discernment would purchase and consume it, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight. This is precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*.\n\n*Composed with reverence by Zhang Quanyi, Daoist friend of the Purple Radiance Grotto on Penglai Mountain*\n\n*Collected Evaluations from Various Masters*\n\n**Daguanzhi** said: *\"Internally, it reveals the mechanisms of heaven; externally, it aligns with human affairs. In its subtlety, even the Eight Scenes of the* Huangting *are insufficient to match its profundity. In its essential teachings, the hundred schools of philosophy and history cannot compare. In its strategic ingenuity, even the works of Sunzi, Wuzi, and Han Fei pale in wonder. Thus, the nature of all things, the calculations of success and failure, the principles of life and death—all are but mechanisms.\"*\n\n**Zhang Guo** said: *\"To observe the Dao of nature is to observe nothing. Not observing with the eyes but with the mind. Observing the profoundly subtle yet seeing nothing—thus one illuminates the nature of the natural. This is what is meant by* yin. *To grasp the conduct of nature is to grasp nothing. Not grasping with the hands but with the mechanism. The mechanism is adaptable and unbound—thus one harmonizes with the manifestations of the natural. This is what is meant by* fu *(another interpretation).\"*\n\nLü Chunyang said: *\"The Song Confucian Shaozi was skilled in reading the* Yin Fu Jing. *‘The cosmos lies within the palm, the myriad transformations arise from the body.’ These are words from the* Yin Fu Jing, *and the* Jirang Pian *borrowed its lines—how subtle the resonance of those who grasp it without words.\"*\n\nLü Qiu Cimeng said: *\"What the* Yin Fu Jing *calls ‘The Dao of nature is quiescent, thus heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born. The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang mutually impel one another, and transformations proceed in accord.’ These few lines—even the words of the Six Classics cannot surpass them.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu said: *\"The four lines beginning with ‘The Dao of nature is quiescent’ are exquisitely put. That stillness can generate movement means it gradually recedes in this way, then gradually grows in that. The Dao of heaven and earth constantly reveals itself to humanity in just this manner.\"* He further remarked: *\"The line ‘The Dao of heaven and earth is gradual’ is superb. The Dao of yin and yang is such that they prevail over one another without a single day’s pause, steadily pressing forward bit by bit—this one retreats a fraction, that one advances a fraction.\"* And again: *\"Were it not for utter stillness, heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things would not arise. The word ‘gradual’ is masterfully chosen—‘gradual’ means incremental. The Dao of heaven and earth incrementally waxes and wanes, thus hardness and softness prevail. This is the principle underlying good fortune, misfortune, constancy, and victory. The* Yin Fu Jing *is particularly fine in such passages.\"*\n\nMaster Zhu also said: *\"The* Yin Fu Jing’s *teaching of ‘three returns in day and night’ resembles the cultivation practices of the midnight-noon circulation—today thus, tomorrow thus, and the more familiar one becomes, the more efficacious the results.\"*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Kao Yi* states: *\"The commentary attributed to the Old Mother of Mount Li is often a later forgery, its language and meaning remarkably shallow.\"*\n\nThe inclusion of Zhang Guo’s sayings reveals that this text postdates him.\n\nOuyang Xunqi said: *\"When the Dao and its arts fragmented, those who could write each composed their own books. Straightforward words often appear flawed or impure, yet the* Yin Fu Jing *alone employs paradox to align with truth.\"*\n\nWei Heshān said: *\"Li Jiayou was broadly versed in the classics and the hundred schools, and deeply steeped in the* Book of Changes*. In his later years, he grasped the teaching of ‘specializing in qi to attain suppleness,’ and through exhaustive study and reflection on the* Yin Fu Jing *and* Cantong Qi*, he held fast to them without wavering. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao necessarily unite these two texts with the* Book of Changes*, employing them as one.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said: *\"The* Yin Fu Jing *and* Daode Jing *both speak of the mechanisms of inversion and counter-application. As for governing the state, waging war, seizing the realm, or the phrases ‘there are wondrous devices,’ ‘the ten thousand images arise,’ ‘the eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle,’ and ‘divine mechanisms and hidden spirits’—all contain profound principles. Yet the world, not understanding, labels the* Yin Fu Jing *as a treatise on military strategy and uses the* Laozi *for governance, missing the mark entirely.\"*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* is a manual of cultivation. *Yin fu* is spoken of in contrast to *yang fire*; it speaks of yin without mentioning yang, for yang is contained within it. The *Yi Yi* states: *\"The Dao is called the alternation of yin and yang.\"* That yin is placed before yang reflects the principle of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things: without stillness, there is no movement, just as *Bo* precedes *Fu*. This single scroll of the *Yin Fu Jing* is the pivot of yin-yang interpenetration. The numinous perishes here, and the non-numinous numinous arises here. This is where concealment and manifestation, reversal and return, ingress and egress, the waxing and waning of sun and moon, the ebb and flow of great and small, the root of life and death’s restraint, the ground where kindness and harm contend, and the realm of water and fire’s advance and retreat all unfold. When yin and yang restrain each other, yin and yang prevail. The *Yin Fu* commands the numinous transformations of change. Yet those who wield the *Yin Fu* must know that the body possesses wondrous devices. Concealing these devices within, awaiting the moment to act, the trigrams, the sexagenary cycle, heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits will all accord with the Dao—what difficulty then remains in enriching the state, pacifying the people, strengthening the army, securing victory, and embracing unity to preserve the true?\"\n\nZheng’s *Bibliographic Survey* records thirty-eight transmitted commentaries on the *Yin Fu Jing*, totaling fifty-one scrolls. Over the centuries since, the number of annotations has grown beyond measure. I have now synthesized explanations from the *Laozi*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *Cantong Qi*, entitling it *A Categorized Exegesis*. *\"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the movement of heaven—this is all.\"*\n\n*\"Observe the Dao of heaven\"*—the text opens by speaking of the *Yin Fu*. Laozi said: *\"Achieving merit, attaining fame, then withdrawing—this is the Dao of heaven.\"* *\"Grasp the movement of heaven\"*—the next phrase supplements *yang fire*. The *Xici* states: *\"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person strengthens themselves without pause.\"* To observe the Dao of heaven is to witness its flourishing and fulfillment, its retreat and storage at winter’s advent—the meaning of *Kun*’s six lines reaching exhaustion lies herein. To grasp the movement of heaven is to seize its latent emergence, its vigilant leaping, until the ninth-five, when the flying dragon ascends to heaven—the meaning of *Kun* following heaven’s movement rides in its wake. The opening two sentences subtly encompass the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*, for the *Yin Fu* is the Dao of the *Book of Changes*. *\"This is all\"*—an exclamation of ultimate insight.\n\n*\"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper. The five thieves reside in the heart, enacted upon heaven. The cosmos lies within the hand, the ten thousand transformations arise within the body.\"*\n\n*Thieves* here align with the meanings of *restraint* and *plunder* below. The *five thieves* are the five phases. Heaven possesses the five phases, where mutual restraint harbors the subtlety of mutual generation, and mutual plunder conceals the mechanism of mutual appropriateness. One who penetrates this principle will see the flourishing of the Dao and qi. The five phases reside within the human heart; only by inverting and counter-applying them can mutual restraint and generation, mutual plunder and appropriateness be achieved. Observing this profound principle, one sees that it is already so in heaven. Those who embody heaven’s enactment will hold the cosmos in their hand and give birth to the ten thousand transformations within their body. *\"Thus it is.\"*\n\nHaving spoken of *\"giving birth to the body,\"* the five thieves are no longer thieves. Heaven’s nature is humanity; the human heart is the trigger. *\"Establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life.\"* *Nature* is principle. The *five thieves* are heaven’s principle, which is also humanity’s principle. Within the person, they are activated by the heart, enabling restraint to harbor generation and plunder to conceal appropriateness—all through the single word *trigger*. The *Yi Yi* states: *\"Establish the Dao of heaven as yin and yang.\"* Speaking of heaven includes earth; speaking of earth includes humanity. Thus, *\"establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life.\"* Yin and yang encompass the five phases—how could humanity exist outside yin and yang?\n\n*\"When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, the stars and planets conceal (or fall) themselves. When earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land. When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn. When heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the ten thousand transformations establish their foundation.\"*\n\n*Unleashing* is the mechanism of life; *killing* is the mechanism of death. Life and death are the triggers of movement and stillness. Concealing the mechanism of life within the mechanism of death is stillness preceding movement. *\"Conceal themselves\"* speaks of covert transformation—stillness is spoken of, yet movement is implied. *\"Rise from the land\"* speaks of surging forth from the earth—movement is spoken of, yet stillness is implied. The phrases of the *Yin Fu* often each express half, prompting the reader to infer the rest. *\"When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn\"*—humanity and heaven-earth form a triad, their killing mechanisms naturally analogous to the *Book of Changes*’ *\"reversing its path, returning in seven days.\"* *Reversal* is the handle of life and death’s alternation, the power of waxing and waning’s control. *\"When heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the ten thousand transformations establish their foundation.\"*\n\n\"This mechanism is the same, this principle is the same. Long ago, Patriarch Lü transformed himself into a servant in the Chen household. Chen and a Daoist were discussing how *'when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn,'* yet they did not grasp the essence of the killing mechanism. Patriarch Lü interjected from the side, saying: *'The living do not truly live; the dead do not truly die. If one kills life after it has arisen and learns death before it arrives, then one attains longevity.'*\n\nNow, considering Patriarch Lü’s words, we understand that the killing mechanism is the pivotal point of life and death. Alas, Chen was misled by the Daoist—startled at first, then swiftly bewildered.\n\nNature possesses both decay and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials, where movement and stillness operate. Fire arises from wood, yet disaster inevitably consumes it. Treachery arises in the state, and when the moment moves, it must collapse.\n\nTo know this and cultivate refinement is to be called a sage.\n\nThere is the nature of *qi*-constitution and the original nature. The nature of *qi*-constitution appears skillful but is truly clumsy. The original nature appears clumsy but is truly skillful. These two can be concealed. When concealed, they remain profoundly still; when stimulated, they penetrate all. The skillful conceals clumsiness, and clumsiness conceals skill.\n\nThe reason people cannot conceal themselves lies in the deviations of the nine orifices. Among these, the ears, eyes, and mouth are the three essentials. These three can move and can be still. In stillness, one contains the light of the eyes, condenses the resonance of the ears, and seals the *qi* of the tongue—thus the three essentials reverse into three treasures. In movement, form blinds, sound deafens, and flavor dulls—thus the three essentials become three calamities.\n\nDo you not see fire? It arises from wood yet consumes wood, just as sight arises from the eyes yet harms them, hearing arises from the ears yet injures them, and flavor arises from the mouth yet dulls it. Likewise, treachery arises in the state: in stillness, deviance lies hidden; in movement, it collapses.\n\nIf one knows the mechanism of movement and stillness, masters stillness, and cultivates refinement, then one may be called a sage.\n\nHeaven gives life, heaven takes life—such is the principle of the Dao. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things. When the three thieves are fitting, the three powers are at peace. Thus it is said: *'Eat in accord with the seasons, and the hundred parts of the body are ordered; move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace.'*\"\n\nLife and death are the wondrous principles of Heaven, which are the wondrous principles of the supreme Dao. That which kills first steals and conceals the qi of life. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. Thus, at winter solstice when spring returns, the qi of life first conceals itself in the place of returning to the root. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity, so when sprouts emerge and husks split, the qi of life first conceals itself within the union of essence. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things, so when taking much and using broadly, the qi of life first conceals itself within preservation and nurturance. Within killing there is life—this is to cultivate primordial qi while awaiting the proper time, which is called \"theft.\"\n\nIn every movement and stillness, the constant of the Two Modes is that they nurture and advance together, and the three thieves nourish one another. Once they nourish one another, Heaven, earth, and humanity mutually conceal their functions. The Three Powers are Heaven, earth, and humanity; though \"things\" are not mentioned, they are included. If one is not at peace, there must be something that does not accord. When the three thieves are fitting, the Three Powers are also at peace. When the Three Powers are at peace, they give birth to and nurture the ten thousand things, moving in accord with the seasons.\n\nThe phrase *\"Thus it is said\"* continues the above and cites an ancient saying: the time when the mechanism of life first stirs is the moment when the qi mechanism first moves. If one swallows it into one’s own domain at that very moment, then the hundred parts of the body are ordered. The mechanism is the mechanism of killing; after great stillness, the first stirring of life arises, and if one ingests it in accord with the time, then the ten thousand images are at great peace. Thus it is said: *\"Move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nPeople know the numinousness of the numinous, but do not know why the non-numinous is numinous. The sun and moon have their cycles, their waxing and waning have their measures, and sagely achievement arises from this, while the workings of spirit emerge from this. In the practice of refinement, nothing is more wondrous than spirit. People know that what is spiritually active is numinous, but do not know why what does not employ spiritual activity is numinous. This spirit arises from the extreme of stillness; when the time comes, the spirit knows, and skillfully discerns the mechanism of movement.\n\nIn its movement, the mechanism is like the sun and moon having their cycles. The *Cantong qi* says:\n*\"On the third day, brightness emerges, as Zhen and Geng receive from the west.\nOn the eighth day, Dui receives Ding, and the waxing half is level as a string.\nOn the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete, and the fullness of Jia fills the east.\nOn the sixteenth, it turns to receive governance, as Xun and Xin appear at dawn.\nGen meets Bing in the south, and the waning half is on the twenty-third.\nOn the thirtieth, Kun and Yi are in the northeast, where its light is lost.\"*\nThese are the cycles of the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nThe six gates and great medicine are measured by the sage using the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. And the six stages of obtaining the elixir should also be aligned with the measures of yin and yang. The *Cantong qi* says: *\"Yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives.\"* When the small departs, the preceding movement is brief—this is the second stage of seeking the medicine. When the great arrives, the subsequent movement is long—this is the fourth stage of compounding the elixir. The twelvefold firing times lie within the cycles of the sun and moon and the measures of their waxing and waning. The sage’s achievement arises from this, and the workings of spirit emerge from this.\n\nAs for the mechanism of theft, none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble person who obtains it strengthens the self; the petty person who obtains it treats life lightly. The mechanism of theft is the mechanism of seizing and plundering. Not only are the mutual conquests of the Five Phases and the mutual encroachments of the Three Powers mechanisms of theft, but even embracing spirit and guarding qi, extracting from Kan to fill Li, are also mechanisms of theft. The perfected person silently moves the numinous mechanism, enters the watery palace, creates in the golden land, follows in the footsteps of the profoundly subtle, and cuts off seeing and hearing—within this, there is that which none can see, none can know. The numinousness of the numinous dies here, and the numinousness of the non-numinous arises here. Thus, the noble person who obtains this mechanism of theft can create destiny and strengthen the self, while the petty person who obtains it will surely harm the self and treat life lightly. This is what is meant by: *\"The upright person uses it for uprightness, the deviant person uses it for deviance.\"*\n\nThe blind are skilled in listening, the deaf are skilled in seeing. Cutting off profit from one source yields tenfold advantage from the teacher. Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher. The blind use their ears as eyes, listening to discern people’s smiles and expressions—thus it is said: *\"The blind are skilled in listening.\"* The deaf use their eyes as ears, using them to gauge people’s voices and emotions—thus it is said: *\"The deaf are skilled in seeing.\"* Yet within our own bodies, there are those without eyes who can listen with subtlety, and those without ears who can see with acuity. Skill in seeing and listening lies in distinguishing whether the source of water is clear or turbid.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Water is good at benefiting the ten thousand things.\"* From this, we know that cutting off excessive beauty reveals the true source of the One. *\"Yields tenfold advantage from the teacher\"* refers to the *Yijing*’s hexagram of Earth over Water as \"the teacher.\" Earth conquers water yet does not move it, so the water becomes even clearer. Using the teacher means employing earth to conquer water, advancing through danger yet proceeding smoothly. With this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow—what blame could there be? Ten is spoken of as the number of completion.\n\n*\"Three returns\"* refers to the number three belonging to wood. The fire essence and water mercury of the Li palace are born within wood, and the fire concealed within wood sinks together into the Kun palace. Kun truly completes Kan and gives birth to water, and the true qi within water becomes metal. After wood carries metal back, one must use *Zhun* and *Meng* to draw and add—thus it is said: *\"Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher.\"* Ten thousand is spoken of as the number of wholeness.\n\nThe fire tally of ten months can refine the treasure into the elixir. Seven returns and nine refinements are the three returns. The mind is born from things and dies from things. The mechanism lies in the eyes. Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it. Swift thunder and fierce winds—none do not stir foolishly. The mind moves because of things—this is being born from things. Pursuing things to the point of loss—this is dying from things.\n\nThe deviance of the nine orifices lies in the three essentials. Of the deviance of the three essentials, nothing is more essential than the eyes. To halt the mechanism, one must employ \"no kindness.\" Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it—within death there is life, within movement there is stillness. Swift thunder and fierce winds all arise from the midst of foolish stirring, yet naturally possess numinous activity.\n\nShould Heaven perpetually employ its wind and thunder, the numinous qi of wind and thunder would eventually be exhausted. How then, beneath the heavy yin, could it await the resurgence of earthly thunder and summon the renewing winds of *xun*?\n\nSupreme joy is abundant in nature; supreme stillness is restrained in nature. Heaven’s utmost partiality becomes the utmost impartiality in its use. Extending the principle of \"no kindness\" from above, \"no kindness\" is akin to \"non-action\"—the utmost of joy, the utmost of stillness. Supreme joy is leisurely and abundant in nature; supreme stillness is pure and incorrupt in nature. Thus, at times Heaven thunders without wind, appearing utterly partial. Yet from this seeming chaos, it issues commands—this is Heaven’s utmost impartiality. Utmost partiality resembles \"no kindness,\" while utmost impartiality gives rise to great kindness.\n\nThe regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Kindness arises from harm, and harm arises from kindness. Sinking water into fire invites self-destruction. (These two lines, in Wang Fengzhou’s edition, follow \"harm arises from kindness,\" forming a coherent meaning; here, the text follows his version.)\n\nThe *Baihu Tong* states: \"禽 (*qin*) means to be captured and controlled by man.\" The regulation of creatures lies in qi—qi is spoken of in terms of fire, and creatures in terms of the Vermilion Bird. To regulate creatures with qi is to regulate fire with fire. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding balance and adjusting victory and defeat.\" This refers to the moment when earth suppresses water and prevents its rise; only the Vermilion Bird’s fire can maintain equilibrium, adjust the balance of power, and through intense refinement, cause water to boil and steam to rise, carrying metal upward with it. Thus, the regulation of the Vermilion Bird lies in sinking fire into water to lift water and restrain fire.\n\nWithin this lies the mechanism of life and death: when water boils and fire ascends into the *Li* palace, the *Li* fire is extinguished by the *Kan* water—this is \"life as the root of death.\" Subdued and constrained, unable to fly or flee, lead and mercury both perish, returning together to the fertile earth. Only through this great death does true life emerge—this is \"death as the root of life.\"\n\n\"Kindness arises from harm\": sinking fire into water. \"Harm arises from kindness\": drawing water into fire. The marvel of sinking water into fire lies in its self-generated life and death within the process, hence it is said: \"self-invited destruction.\" Fools revere the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred, while I regard the patterns of the seasons and things as wise.\n\nFools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages. Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages. (These six lines are said by tradition to be the words of Wu Bo’s praise. The Fengzhou manuscript omits them, but I retain them here, placing them below “self-invited destruction.”)\n\nFools take mastery of celestial patterns and scrutiny of earthly principles as sagacity—yet if this is all, what benefit does it bring to body and mind? I examine the marvel of seasonal movement within celestial patterns and contemplate the mechanism of life’s emergence within earthly principles, stealing from Heaven and Earth to seize the workings of Creation—only then do I not shame the name of wisdom. This is what is meant by “observing the Dao of Heaven and grasping the movements of Heaven”—it is perfection itself.\n\n“Fools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages.” This is what is meant by “those who refine through knowledge are called sages.” “Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages.” This is what is meant by “people know the divine as divine, yet do not know the divinity of the non-divine.”\n\nMoreover, the sun and moon follow fixed paths, the great and small adhere to their measures, the Three Powers steal from one another—all are the sagely workings of nature. What is strange about this?\n\nThese six lines all seem to elaborate and praise the preceding passage.\n\nThe Dao of nature is quiescent, thus Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in harmony. The Dao of nature is simply quiescence alone. From quiescence arises movement, and through movement, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simply gradualness alone. Gradualness is the image of nature. Yin gradually descends, yang gradually ascends. The marvel of yin and yang’s ascent and descent lies in their mutual overcoming. Without mutual overcoming, there is no mutual propulsion. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in accordance with nature.\n\nTransformations are the image of advance and retreat. Master Zhu said: “These four lines on nature are exquisitely put.” He also said: “The character ‘gradual’ is wonderfully chosen.”\n\nThus, the sage knows the Dao of nature cannot be defied and thereby harnesses it. The Dao of utmost quiescence cannot be matched by calendrical calculations. Hence, there is the marvelous device from which arise the ten thousand images, the Eight Trigrams, and the celestial stems and earthly branches. Within it lie the divine mechanisms, the hidden workings of ghosts, and the arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming. How luminous—it transcends mere images!\n\nTo “thereby harness it” means to take the Dao of nature and fashion it into the methods of refinement. The Dao of nature truly emerges from utmost quiescence. Within this quiescence, there exists another realm of years and months, Heaven and Earth—unfathomable by human calendars and measurements.\n\nWhere does quiescence reside? There is a marvelous device: the Mysterious Pass, the single aperture. Within it, the ten thousand images arise, the Eight Trigrams transform, and the celestial stems and earthly branches revolve. The divine mechanisms are unfathomable, the hidden workings of ghosts are inscrutable, and the numerology of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming all emerge from within. How luminous—this is a principle visible to all, not some obscure or esoteric matter. It transcends mere images, for images are but the images of the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Taishang Huangting Waijing Jing*\nSecret Manuscript of the Two Perfected Ones, Danxia and Qingxia\nCommentary by Hanxuzi of Zixia Cave, Mount Yuanqiao\n\n**Chapter One**\nLaozi, in leisure, composed seven-character verses,\nExplaining the body’s form and the various spirits.\nAbove lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin,\nBefore the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life.\nBreathing the void into the Cinnabar Field,\nJade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.\nThe Youth Who Governs the True consumes fetal essence—\nThose who can refine this may endure forever.\n\nThis chapter is the opening hymn of the Lesser Yang Patriarch. The Patriarch said: Lord Lao often recited the Jade Texts, and from the *Neijing Jing*, he distilled the essentials into seven-character verses, still calling it the *Huangting*, but distinguishing it as the *Waijing*. “Inner” and “outer” refer to before and after, not the internal and external of the body. What it expounds are the five forms of the body and the ten thousand spirits within—truly essential teachings.\n\nThe Most High takes emptiness and non-being as the root. Between above and below, before and behind, there exists a circle of emptiness and non-being. Those who can guard this will find their breath deeply entering the Cinnabar Field, nurturing the primordial, utterly pure water in the Jade Pool of another’s household to irrigate their own numinous root. When the numinous root is firm, the foundation of the elixir is established.\n\nThe Youth Who Governs the True is the fetal infant. The fetal infant is the ancestor of the ten thousand spirits. Nurturing it daily, consuming the mysterious essence of fetal breathing—those who refine this may attain immortality. Irrigating the numinous root speaks of nourishing the self with the postnatal; consuming fetal essence speaks of nurturing the elixir with the prenatal. Such is the marvelous meaning of this hymn.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* transmitted in the world omits Laozi’s two lines on leisure and alters the rest into four-character verses: “Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin, before the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life. Breathing beyond the hut, entering and exiting the Cinnabar Field—those who can practice this may endure forever.” The line about the Youth Who Governs the True is missing from all versions. Without seeing the true text, one nearly loses the true visage of Mount Lu.\n\nWhen I first intended to annotate the *Huangting*, I was suddenly visited in my mountain studio by the Perfected One Danxia, who said: “I received a letter from Lady Wei, instructing you to collate and annotate the *Huangting*, and to show you the secret manuscript from the Orchid Terrace for a day.” There was a Daoist, Canxia, who obtained a manuscript from Yang, the Prefectural Governor of Nanyue, and sent it to Chipingzi, who then showed it to me. Comparing it with Danxia’s version, I found that the celestial palace’s secret records were indeed identical. Delighted, I recorded this in the annotations.\n\n**Chapter Two**\n\nThe Perfected One of the Yellow Court wears crimson robes,\nWith bolts and locks sealing the double gates.\nThe Dark Gatekeeper makes them towering and majestic,\nWhile within the Cinnabar Field, essence and qi grow subtle.\n\nThe Jade Pool’s limpid water nurtures fertile soil,\nThe numinous root stands firm, never aging nor withering.\n*Yao* and *yao* are both locks—their mechanism has yin and yang:\nWhen the gate is closed, the yang bolt enters the yin socket,\nso the lock fastens and the double gates seal.\nThis metaphor speaks of spirit and qi uniting,\nlike yin and yang interlocking.\nThose who write *zhuang* (壮) are mistaken.\n\n\"Nurturing fertile soil\" means drawing the purest, undisturbed water\nfrom another’s Jade Pool to irrigate daily.\nThus, barren earth transforms into rich soil,\nand the numinous root takes deep, stable hold,\nremaining steadfast and unyielding,\nnever withering even in old age.\nI have seen this in the fourth chapter of the *Inner Radiance*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Three**\nWithin the Central Pool dwells a scholar clad in crimson,\nThree inches below the field lies the spirit’s abode.\nInner and outer are kept apart, doubly sealed—\nWithin the spirit’s chamber, devote yourself to cultivation.\nThe Mysterious Throat’s qi-channel receives the essence-tally;\nHasten to secure your essence to sustain yourself.\n\nThe Central Pool is the Sea of Qi, also called the Center.\nWithin it resides one who cultivates the body,\nclad in crimson robes—this refers to the heart-spirit.\nThe *field* is the Cinnabar Field.\nOne inch below it is the Pass of Origin,\ntwo inches, the Central Pole,\nthree inches, the Meeting of Yin—\nall are dwelling places of the spirit,\nnot just the Central Pool.\nThough the Central Pool and the three inches below the field\nare separated by inner and outer,\nif they are tightly sealed layer upon layer,\nthe inner spirit will not escape.\n\nThe *spirit’s chamber* is the spirit’s dwelling.\nWithin it, one must cultivate purity and stillness,\nallowing no external distractions to intrude.\nPreserve it as if it were ever-present,\nnurturing the inner fire of spirit.\nWhen water suddenly arrives to balance it,\nthe Mysterious Throat’s qi-channel bears the essence-tally.\nThe *essence-tally* is the union of essence and spirit,\nusing water to temper fire.\nEssence within my body is called *child-essence*.\nFrom this, swiftly secure and harmonize it to sustain yourself,\nand the Orthodox Unity will contain its bloom.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four**\nWithin the dwelling resides a scholar ever clad in deep red—\nIf you can perceive him, you will not fall ill.\nA horizontal path, a foot in length, binds him above;\nIf you can guard it, you will know no harm.\nInhaling and exhaling within the chamber to replenish yourself,\nPreserve its wholeness and firmness, and the body will receive blessings.\nWithin the square inch, carefully conceal and store—\nSpirit and essence return, and old age regains youth.\nLet the Dark Gatekeeper’s flow descend to its end,\nNurture the jade tree of the child so it may serve as a staff.\n\nThe opening line echoes the *Inner Radiance*:\n\"Within the dwelling resides a Perfected One, ever clad in cinnabar.\"\nThe *dwelling* is the numinous abode,\nthe ground where yin elixir is cultivated.\nIt is also called the *chamber* or the *square inch*.\nMeasured horizontally, its length does not exceed a foot,\nbinding the inner spirit above.\nEnsure the inner realm does not leak out,\nand the outer realm does not intrude.\nGuard it here, breathe here,\npreserve and nurture here,\nconceal and store here,\nand spirit and essence return to their root here.\n\nThe Dark Gatekeeper makes the flow surge downward to its end—\n*end* means cessation.\n*Nurturing the jade tree of the child* means irrigating the numinous root,\nso its jade branches flourish,\nable to serve as a staff.\nThis metaphor speaks of the inner elixir’s accomplishment,\nthe meaning of supporting old age.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five**\nThe Supreme Dao is not burdensome nor deviates from its course,\nThe numinous terrace stands at heaven’s center, overlooking the central wilds.\n\nWithin the square inch lies the space beneath the Dark Gate,\nWithin the Jade Chamber stand the spirit’s gates and doors.\nAll these were taught to me by the Lord’s Son.\n\n*Wù* means opposition, but also movement.\nThe Supreme Dao moves in reversal,\nyet differs from the heterodox paths’ reversal—\nthose that ascend left and descend right are not the true course.\nIt must rise behind and descend before,\nfor this is the great road of nature.\n\nThe Numinous Terrace arises at heaven’s center,\nthe very place where the true heart manifests.\nBelow, it overlooks the central wilds,\nits attention fixed upon the Central Yellow Court.\nThe *square inch* is the compass’s center;\n*beneath the Dark Gate* is below the navel.\nThe Jade Chamber is the *Inner Radiance*’s Golden Casket and Jade Chamber—\nwhen speaking of the Jade Chamber, the Golden Casket is also within.\n\nMan’s spirit dwells in the eyes,\nhence they are the spirit’s gates and doors,\nas the classic says: “The mechanism lies in the eyes.”\nThis is the essence of the Supreme Dao,\nall taught to me by the Lord’s Son, Wood’s Duke.\nThe Lord’s Son is the Thunder Sovereign,\nthe eldest son, the Dragon.\nThe Dragon emerges from fire,\nmercury’s nature is numinous and penetrating.\nThe Dao teaches one to first clarify one’s own nature;\nwhen one’s own nature is clarified,\none awakens of oneself.\nAwakening of oneself\nis like the Lord’s Son teaching me.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six**\nThe Hall of Light extends in four directions, the source of the Dharma Sea.\nBefore me stands the True Man’s Elixir Child.\nBetween the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—\nif you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.\n\nThe Hall of Light is the Hall of Light Palace.\nThis palace lies within an inch between the brows,\nwhere sun, moon, and constellations shine with radiance,\nhence “extends in four directions.”\nWhen the medicine is circulated here,\nit is the gathering place of the elixir method,\nthe source of living water from which all transforms—\nhence “the source of the Dharma Sea.”\n\nThe *Elixir Child* is the Golden Embryo.\nThe Golden Embryo is the True Man’s body.\nWith metal restraining wood,\nthe mother comes to see the child,\nforming the true body—\nhence “the True Man’s Elixir Child.”\nFrom the Hall of Light, one enters the Spirit Chamber;\nthe Spirit Chamber lies before the Hall of Light,\nhence “stands before me.”\n\nThe Three Passes are explained in the *Inner Radiance* commentary.\n*“If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun”*—\nthis is a wondrous phrase within the mysterious,\nnot to be overlooked.\n\nUpper Kunlun is the place for refining the yang spirit,\nthe realm of longevity and distant death—\nthis is what all know.\nYet there is more:\nMiddle Kunlun, hidden within the body,\nis a realm of utmost purity and emptiness.\nQi and spirit merge,\nblending into oneness,\nas if entering a boundless void.\nThough the body contains the Three Passes—upper, middle, and lower—\nhere, no such divisions exist.\nThe One True shines alone,\nall phenomena are void,\ntranscending all extremes,\nattaining the towering realm.\nAs Master Zhang Sanfeng’s *Daoist Song* says:\n*“The idle True Man hides within,\nthe Master sits atop Kunlun.”*\nHere, one beholds the precelestial, immortal yang spirit,\nfree from the postcelestial, karmic yin spirit—\nhence *“Between the Three Passes, essence and qi run deep—\nif you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.”*\n\nThose who recite the *Yellow Court Classic*\nmust focus on the words *“between.”*\n\nThere is also Lower Kunlun,\nthe source of firing the elixir—\nall should know this.\n\nThose who cultivate Kunlun\nmust concentrate their spirit between the Three Passes.\nHere lies the purest essence,\nthe most refined qi.\nWhen spirit enters this realm,\nit is profound, vast, and boundless,\nutterly empty—\nthe heart is perfectly clear yet free from thoughts.\nIn an instant, one transcends to the highest vehicle.\n\nOrdinary people, upon seeing “Kunlun,”\nsay the secret lies in the Mud Pill Palace.\nHad it not been for the repeated guidance of my masters Wushan and Baohe,\nwho would have known to direct their attention\nbetween the Three Passes?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven**\nThe Crimson Palace’s twelve-tiered tower,\nwithin its halls, the five hues gather.\nThe Red Spirit’s Child stands in the Central Pool,\nbelow lies the Long Wall and the Dark Valley’s town.\n\nThe essential wonder of longevity is received in the chamber.\nThe Crimson Palace lies beneath the tower.\nWhen the medicine enters the Crimson Palace,\nit must first descend the lung’s twelve-tiered tower.\n\n*“Within its halls”* refers to the Yellow Court.\nPursuing the two qi along the Yellow Path,\nuniting the three natures in the Yellow Court,\nthe five qi return to their origin,\nall beauties assemble—\nhence *“the five hues gather.”*\n\nThe *Red Spirit’s Child* is true intent.\nBorn from the heart, it is called the Red Spirit’s Child.\nThe *Central Pool* is the Primordial Sea.\nWhen the five hues gather,\ntrue earth seizes true lead,\ntrue lead restrains true mercury,\nstabilized and unmoving,\nspirit and qi congeal—\nhence *“stands.”*\n\nBelow the Central Pool lies the Long Wall—\nthe Golden Dike.\nThere is also the Dark Valley—\nthe Water Realm.\nThe town within is where cultivators receive their sustenance,\nlike a human city with walls enclosing it,\nmoats surrounding it—\na place of utmost security.\n\nThe essential wonder of longevity\nis obtained from the chamber.\nDaoists call it the *life-extending technique*,\nakin to the union of man and woman,\nyet not the art of sexual combat—\nmerely the mutual resonance of spirit and qi,\nthe merging of metal and wood.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight**\nAbandon lust and desire, focus on your essence;\nthe inch-field and foot-dwelling can sustain life.\nTethered to the long flow, the heart finds peace,\nobserving the will, the spirit roams—threefold numinosity.\nAt leisure, without affairs, the heart is at great peace.\n\nThe first line urges one to renounce lust\nand secure essence by guarding against desire.\nThe *inch-field* is the Gate of Life.\nThe *foot-dwelling* is the spirit’s abode.\nThe *Inner Radiance* says:\n*“Square and round, an inch within the Gate of Life.”*\nThis text says:\n*“Measured horizontally, its length does not exceed a foot,\nbinding the inner spirit above.”*\nThis is the place to nurture oneself and preserve the heart—\nthe common folk mistake it for the face, but this is wrong.\n\nIf the heart is not at peace,\nit is due to outward distraction and restless wandering.\nThus, one must tether it within to calm the heart.\n*“Observing the will”* means closing off and inwardly gazing\nto uphold one’s resolve.\n*“The spirit roams”* means the True Man sinks into the deep abyss,\nfloating and guarding the compass’s center,\nwith the bearing of one swimming in self-contentment.\n\nAt this moment, essence, qi, and spirit unite as one, undivided—hence called the Three Wondrous Numinous. Leisurely and at ease, without affairs or action, the heart’s realm attains supreme peace.\n\n**Chapter Nine**\nConstantly preserve the Jade Chamber so spirit achieves clarity,\nTimely contemplate the Great Granary to avoid hunger and thirst.\nCommand the Six Ding spirit-maidens to attend,\nSeal the path of essence—thus may one live long.\n\n\"Constantly preserve the Jade Chamber\" means moment by moment abiding in spirit; with eyes closed and inwardly guarded, spirit does not wander outward, growing ever more settled and wise. People know the spirit’s numinosity as clarity, yet do not realize that the spirit’s non-numinosity is true clarity. \"Timely contemplate the Great Granary\" means regulating and nurturing it with light flavors. The Great Granary is the stomach, where intention-as-earth resides; where intention abides, there too is the Great Granary—one must not cling to the stomach as a physical form. Daoist adepts regard the Mysterious Pass as the Great Granary Cavity, the place of embryonic breathing and abiding breath. The *Inner Radiance* states, *“Square and round, an inch within the Gate of Life.”* My mountain’s teaching holds it as the dwelling of intention—a truly penetrating discourse. When intention-as-earth flourishes, it enables the stomach to digest grains and liquids, transforming food and drink, hence “to avoid hunger and thirst.” The Six Ding spirits are called “maidens” as they are yin spirits. When yang spirit resides within me, I can command the Six Ding, summoning them to attend. Such is the Way of long life—all hinges on sealing the path of essence.\n\n**Chapter Ten**\nWithin the central chamber, spirit’s dwelling place,\nWash the heart and govern oneself—let no defilement dare intrude.\nSurvey the five viscera, inspect their order,\nThe six bowels refined and purified, pristine as silk.\nEmptiness and spontaneity are the Dao’s origin.\n\nThe \"central chamber\" is the spirit’s central abode, neither biased nor partial. With the heart cleansed and withdrawn, one diligently cultivates and governs, allowing no impurity to defile it. Thus, inwardly observing the five viscera, each appears as if illuminated by candlelight; the body’s rhythms may all be scrutinized. Thus, inwardly observing, the six bowels are each refined and purified, immaculate as undyed silk, utterly free of filth. The Dao of emptiness and spontaneity has been thus since antiquity. *Gu* means origin.\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\nThings possess their nature—affairs need not be burdensome,\nHands folded in repose, non-action brings the body ease.\nEmbodying emptiness, the heart finds leisure,\nSilent and vast, the mouth utters no word.\nCultivating harmony, one stands alone in the True Person’s palace,\nSerene and desireless, wandering the garden of virtue.\nPure and fragrant, immaculate, the Jade Maiden abides,\nCultivating virtue and illuminating goodness—this is the Dao’s gate.\n\nThings include yin things and yang things,\nDividing inner and outer within Heaven and Earth.\nHere, the term *thing* refers to what lies within.\nFor those who cultivate inner things, there is a principle of spontaneity—\nNo need for excess; their affairs are inherently unburdensome.\nWhen the body is at ease, essence remains unmoved;\nWhen the heart is at leisure, spirit is undisturbed;\nWhen the mouth speaks not, qi does not scatter.\nOne should simply sit upright in non-action,\nEmbodying emptiness, free of things,\nSilent and vast.\nCultivating the Great Harmony, guarding the center, standing alone—\nThis is called the True Person’s palace.\nSerene and desireless within,\nWandering the garden of virtue, the jade sprout glows resplendent.\nAt this time, purity is untainted, fragrance unstained,\nAnd the Jade Maiden endures.\nThe Jade Maiden is a metaphor for inner mercury.\n*Virtue* is what one receives from Heaven—\nEmpty, numinous, and unobscured,\nPossessing all principles and responding to the myriad things.\nCultivation restores its empty, numinous essence.\n*Goodness* is what Heaven bestows upon humanity—\nThe primal spark,\nThe root of nature and the stem of the heart.\nIlluminating it reveals one’s original truth.\nThe gate of the Great Dao first teaches one to fulfill their nature—\nThis lies in cultivating virtue and illuminating goodness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nPracticing the Dao in leisure, the body dwells alone,\nNurturing nature and life, guarding emptiness and nothingness.\nSerene and desireless—what thoughts or cares arise?\nWings fully formed, upright and flourishing,\nOne attains long life and enduring vision, then takes flight.\n\n*Practicing the Dao* refers to cultivation.\nThe cultivator, whether in the world or beyond it,\nMust move with ease and contentment,\nGuarding their body and dwelling alone.\nWithin the body lie nature and life—\nOne must daily uphold and nurture them.\nFirst refine jade to illuminate nature,\nThen refine gold to establish life—\nThe essential secret lies in inwardly guarding emptiness and nothingness.\nBorn between Heaven and Earth,\nHumans are beset by thoughts and cares.\nIf one guards emptiness and nothingness,\nThey become serene and desireless,\nActing without action—what thoughts or cares remain?\nThe immortals refine qi to forge wings;\nWhen spirit is complete and qi is full,\nThe wings are formed.\n*Upright and flourishing* describes the flourishing of spirit and qi.\nFrom this, nature is preserved within,\nThe body is fortified without,\nOne may appear or vanish in the world,\nAttaining long life and enduring vision.\nWeary of the dusty realm,\nThey shed their shell and take flight.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nThe Five Phases interweave, sharing a common root and node,\nThree and five unite—essence lies in their oneness.\nWho shares this with the Dipper and Sun-Moon?\nEmbracing the pearl, cherishing the jade, harmonizing the Chamber of the Child.\nIf you can guard the One, all affairs are complete;\nIt is yours to hold—do not lose it.\nIf you wish not to die, conceal it in the golden chamber.\n\n*Interweaving* refers to their intricate interplay.\nIn the Five Phases’ sequence,\nMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth generate and nourish one another.\nIn their interweaving,\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth restrain and regulate each other.\nBetween them, Wood descends and Metal ascends,\nWater presides and Fire serves—\nTheir functions cannot be equalized,\nThus the Five Phases interweave.\nYet when their qi converges,\nThey share a common root and node.\nThree and five unite—\nTheir sum is eight,\nDividing yin and yang,\nFitting the return after seven days.\nTracing their origin,\nThey arise from the void, generating the One qi.\nThis One qi produces yin and yang—\nThus their essence lies in oneness.\nThis One qi is nurtured in emptiness.\n*Who shares this?* The Northern Dipper and the Two Luminaries.\nThe Dipper’s handle and scoop move with the stars to mark time,\nThe Sun of Li and Moon of Kan—\nWater and Fire dwell in the same palace, refining together.\nI merely embrace the bright pearl,\nCherish the fine jade,\nAnd cultivate harmony in the Chamber of the Child.\nThe Chamber of the Child is emptiness.\nIf you can guard the One qi of emptiness,\nAwaiting its arrival to seize it,\nThen nature and life are yours—\nAll affairs are complete.\nThe One is a thing you inherently possess—\nSimply hold it firmly and do not lose it.\nLose it, and you die;\nRetain it, and you do not die.\nIf you wish not to die,\nYou must conceal this One within the golden chamber,\nNever parting from it—\nThus the Great Elixir is accomplished.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nEmerging with the sun, entering with the moon—this is my Dao,\nHeaven’s seven and Earth’s two guard together.\nAscending and descending, advancing and retreating—one unites with nine,\nJade and stone gleaming—this is my treasure.\nYou possess it yourself—why not guard it?\n\nThe heart understands the root and stem, nurturing radiant splendor,\nServing Heaven and following Earth, concealing the sea of essence.\nWithin seven days, they return and unite,\nThe nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.\n\n*Emerging with the sun, entering with the moon* describes the path of yang departing and yin arriving—\nThus it is my Dao.\n*Heaven’s seven* is the fire’s completion number.\nFire completes in Heaven, descending from above—\nThe hexagram *Wei Ji* (Before Completion).\n*Earth’s two* is the fire’s generating number,\nFire arises from Earth, ascending from below—\nThe hexagram *Ji Ji* (After Completion).\nThese two hexagrams guard one another—\nThis is the work of Metal and Water.\n*Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating* refer to above and below.\n*One unites with nine*—Metal and Water must not part.\nAdvancing, Water’s Metal ascends;\nRetreating, Metal’s Water descends—\nThis is the wonder of augmentation and reduction.\n*Jade and stone gleaming* compares the golden liquid,\nDroplet by droplet, like eggs or pills,\nDescending the throat—\nThe supreme treasure of my body.\nThe Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is inherent in everyone—\nHaving attained it, how could one not guard it?\nThe work of guarding it is to deepen the root and firm the stem.\nThose who understand this Dao know no method more wondrous than the heart.\nWhen the heart comprehends the root and stem,\nIt nurtures the Returned Elixir with Metal and Water—\nGlowing brilliantly, gradually producing radiant splendor.\nThis method requires only serving Qian Heaven,\nFollowing Kun Earth,\nActing in accord with Heaven’s timing,\nAnd concealing the sea of essence.\nWithin seven days, they return and unite,\nThe nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.\n\nThe Sea of Essence is the Primordial Sea. Within the seven days of returning and uniting, the revolving celestial cycle rises into the inner courtyard, merging with the elixir already conjoined within me. It is nurtured in the Central Kunlun and harmonized in the Upper Kunlun, where emptiness becomes clarity and the original nature shines with perfect brightness. Thus it is said, \"The nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nHow towering stands the Mountain of Nine Springs!\nWithin it dwells a true person who may be summoned.\nShielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower,\nFlanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls.\nFor ten thousand years, its radiance shines without end—\nExternally, the Three Yang substances arrive of themselves;\nInternally, nurturing the Three Spirits grants longevity.\nWhen the hun-soul longs for heaven and the po-soul sinks into the abyss,\nTo return the hun and restore the po is the Dao’s natural way,\nThat one may form the pearl and secure the numinous root.\n\nThe Nine Springs are the Nine Liquid Sources spoken of in the *Inner Landscape*. Nine is Metal; the source is Water. The preceding text spoke of the function of Metal and Water; this chapter speaks of their root. The Nine Springs lie within the Lower Kunlun, hence \"the Mountain of Nine Springs.\" *Tingting* describes the mountain’s height. Within the mountain dwells a true person, named the Mysterious Dark Youth or Peach Vitality, who may be employed as a servant. \"Shielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower, flanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls\" describes the strictness of its protection. When protection is strict, the inner fire remains pure, and the immortal Dao may be attained. \"For ten thousand years, its radiance shines\"—enduring brightness and prolonged vision cannot be measured by any fixed term. This is the joy of the Great Return.\n\nWhen one first refines the elixir within and establishes the crucible without, Qian’s Three Yang and Kun’s Three Yin are inverted, host and guest intermingled. When Qian enters Kun, the Three Yang lie externally, and in an instant, the primordial single entity arrives of itself, unbidden—this is called \"lead within water.\" With lead, one restrains mercury; from without, one returns within, gathering essence to nurture spirit, using the Three Yang to replenish the Three Yin, restoring the Qian body and thereby achieving longevity. The Three Spirits are the Three Yin. To nurture the Three Spirits internally is to subdue the outer elixir with the inner elixir. Once the inner elixir is subdued, clarity and stability prevail, and one may attain long life. Those who do not attain long life, at the moment of death, find their hun-soul longing for heaven and their po-soul sinking into the abyss—hun and po estranged, lead and mercury each following their own path. To return the hun and restore the po is to draw the hun downward when it seeks to ascend and raise the po upward when it seeks to descend, so that hun and po constrain one another. As the *Awakening to Reality* says, \"The earthly po seizes the cinnabar mercury; the celestial hun restrains the watery metal.\" This is the natural affair of the Great Dao. When elixir refinement reaches this point, one may nearly have formed the luminous pearl, forever securing the wondrous root and becoming an immortal.\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\nThe revolving pivot suspends the pearl in endless gyre,\nJade key and golden key seal the body whole and firm.\nBorne by earth, it revolves through heaven, circling Qian and Kun,\nIts image the four seasons, red as cinnabar bright.\n\nBefore high, behind low—each a different gate,\nOne sends forth the returning elixir, the other the mysterious spring.\nThe tortoise draws qi to the numinous root.\n\nThe revolving pivot: when advancing the Yang fire, the pivot revolves upward.\nThe suspended pearl: when withdrawing the Yin tally, the pearl jade descends.\nThese two, like a ring without end.\n\nWhen they enter within, the Yang elixir and Yin elixir congeal in union,\nJade key and golden key seal and secure the original body, whole and firm.\nBorne by earth: the Yellow Court’s Kun earth.\nRevolving through heaven: the white fluid’s Qian metal.\nWithin one celestial cycle, the wonders of Qian and Kun’s Yin and Yang are exhausted.\nIts bathing at Mao and You, its waxing and waning, its generation and completion,\nAgain mirror the division of the four seasons.\nAs the four seasons proceed, with the blossoms and fruits of the four seasons,\nIn the tenth month, frost flies, leaves yellow, and fruit ripens—\nIts redness like cinnabar—this is why returning to the root and reverting to the origin is called \"elixir.\"\n\nThe place where the elixir is nurtured: before high, behind low.\nBefore, the Ren vessel ends at the lower abdomen—its image high;\nBehind, the Du vessel begins at the tailbone—its form low.\nOne high, one low—these are the gates for the Golden Elixir’s exit and entry.\nTheir comings and goings differ: the outward journey sends forth, the inward journey returns.\nWhen the returning elixir is in hand, it is entrusted to the mysterious spring.\nThe mysterious spring is the deep abyss within the void.\nVulgar explanations take it as the sublingual spring—this is exoteric speech.\nThe closing line says, \"The tortoise draws qi to the numinous root.\"\nIf it were not deep, how could it be called the numinous root?\n\n---\n\nChapter Seventeen\n\nWithin is a true person, head wrapped in golden cloth,\nBearing armor and holding talismans, opening the seven gates.\nThis is no branch or leaf—it is the very root.\nDay and night, ponder it, and you may long endure.\n\n\"Within\" refers to the midst of the deep abyss, not within the fleshly heart.\nThe seven gates correspond to the seven orifices.\nThe fleshly heart has seven orifices; the numinous heart also has seven orifices.\nThis may be compared with chapter twenty-eight of the *Inner Landscape*.\n\n---\n\nChapter Eighteen\n\nImmortal and Daoist are not possessed of spirits—\nThey accumulate essence and amass qi to become true.\nAll people eat grains and the five flavors,\nYet they alone consume the Great Harmony’s Yin-Yang qi.\nThus they do not die, and their heavenly phase is exhausted.\n\nThe qi of Great Harmony is that which Yin and Yang unite to form.\n\"Exhausted\" means \"fully realized.\"\nTo be exhausted with heaven is truly to be without exhaustion.\n\n---\n\nChapter Nineteen\n\nLet me speak of the five viscera, each with its direction:\nThe heart is the lord of the state, king of the five viscera.\nWhen intent moves or rests, qi accompanies it—\nThe Dao naturally guards my spirit’s luminous light.\nIt connects my flowery essence to harmonize Yin and Yang,\nAll day radiant, at night self-guarding.\nThirst is quenched, hunger sated of itself,\nPassing through the six bowels, stored at Mao and You.\nTurning Yang into Yin, hidden within the nine,\nIf one can practice this with care, one will never grow old.\n\nThe five viscera take the heart as their ruler; the person takes the body as their state—\nThus the heart is called the king.\nIntent arises from the true heart: at rest, it depends on qi; in motion, it assists qi.\nThese two are one, hence it is said they \"accompany\" it.\nTo attain true intent, the Dao lies in guarding the spirit’s luminosity.\nIf one can guard the spirit’s luminosity, one can generate true intent,\nConnect one’s flowery essence, and harmonize Yin and Yang.\nFlowery essence is true lead.\nWhen lead and mercury unite, Yin and Yang harmonize.\nFrom this, at dawn one practices *zhun*, at dusk *meng*;\nBy day, radiant and advancing fire; by night, silent and advancing the tally.\nWithdrawing metal and adding water, thirst is quenched and hunger sated.\n\"Passing through the six bowels\" means primordial qi fills the entire body,\nStoring the elixir at the Mao and You gates.\nTo store is to turn Yang into Yin, like the hidden dragon concealed in the first nine—\nAll is the work of intent’s movement and rest.\nIf one can practice this with care, one will never grow old.\n\n---\n\nChapter Twenty\n\nThe qi of the liver is supple and long,\nArraying the five viscera to generate the three luminaries.\nAbove, it joins the three burners; below, the jade nectar.\nMy spirit, hun-soul, and po-soul reside at the center.\nEssential fluids flow like springs, transforming foulness into fragrance,\nStanding at the suspended hall, embracing the Hall of Light.\nThunder and lightning, claps and bolts, follow one another—\nLeft Mao, right You—these are my treasures.\nHidden at the mysterious gate, awaiting the heavenly Dao,\nNear to my body, yet guarding itself.\nIn purity and non-action, the spirit lingers and abides,\nEssence and spirit ascend and descend, each in its proper place.\nThe heavenly Dao is unobstructed, the herb of long life grows—\nThe seven orifices are opened, and one never grows old.\nSitting at the Gate of Heaven, awaiting Yin and Yang,\nDescending through the throat to connect with the spirit’s luminosity.\nPassing beneath the flowery canopy, cool and clear,\nEntering the icy abyss, one sees one’s own form.\nWhen the returning elixir is complete, one may long endure.\nBelow is the flowery pond, stirring the kidney’s essence.\nStanding at the Hall of Light, facing the cinnabar field,\nIt commands the various spirits to open the Gate of Life.\nThe heavenly Dao is unobstructed, reaching the numinous root—\nYin and Yang arrayed like streaming stars.\n\n(One version ends with \"The liver’s qi circulates without end,\" which seems to capture the essence of this chapter. Perhaps a later commentator’s note, these seven characters were mistakenly incorporated into the text and are preserved here.)\n\nThe liver’s qi is expansive and flowing, abundant and vigorous—\nTruly able to shelter the entire body.\nEarlier it spoke of the six bowels; here, the five viscera—\nBoth viscera and bowels are moistened by the wood’s fluid.\nArraying the five viscera, each viscus supports the others,\nJoining the three burners and descending jade nectar,\nThen uniting with the primordial qi to circulate without cease.\nThe liver stores the hun-soul; here, it speaks of my heart-spirit and lung-po,\nAll gathering in the central yellow palace.\nWood generates essential fluids, transforming them into flowing springs,\nWhich can wash away foulness and impart their pure fragrance.\n\"Standing at the suspended hall\" means the fluids hesitate to descend,\nTheir qi already embracing the Hall of Light.\nIn an instant, the flowing spring surges forth,\nIrrigating the three palaces; in the stomach, sounds like thunder and lightning—\nThen it settles in the Hall of Light, following one another,\nDescending to the Crimson Palace and returning to the primordial sea.\n\nHere at the Gate of Mao and You, when turning left the qi emerges, when turning right the fluids enter—this is the supreme treasure of my body. Between Xu and Hai, it lies concealed at the Mysterious Gate, awaiting the revolutions of the Great Dao.\n\nMen speak of the celestial Dao as distant; I say the celestial Dao is near. The cycles of the celestial degrees reside within my body—one must simply guard its principles. Through purity and non-action, the inner spirits abide; essence and spirit separate and order themselves above and below. Coming and going, they dredge the joints, opening the great Dao of the entire body—this is the immortal herb of longevity. Through diligent irrigation, the mind-ground becomes clear and bright; the seven apertures open, and aging is forever unknown.\n\nThis great fortune relies entirely on the two qi of yin and yang. The qi ascending above the Celestial Gate is \"pure\"; the qi descending below the Celestial Gate is \"mysterious.\" As the *Inner Landscape* states: \"Emerging pure, entering mysterious—these two qi shine forth.\" Thus, one must concentrate the spirit and still the breath, returning to sit at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the separation of yin and yang. When the pure ascends and the mysterious descends, then the cold spring drips drop by drop, flowing down the throat to connect with the divine luminosity. Passing through the floral canopy, it is clear and cool; entering the deep abyss, it is crystalline and cold. It washes the heart and purifies thoughts, revealing my true form—serene and desireless. This is called the Returned Elixir. Once the Returned Elixir is achieved, one may attain longevity.\n\nBefore the Golden Elixir returns, below lies the Floral Pool, called the Sea of Qi. The essence within the kidneys stirs here; I stand in the Hall of Light to observe it, illuminating the Cinnabar Field. This is the Office of the General, governing plans and deliberations. The General’s intent is to command all spirits to open the Life Gate, dredging the celestial Dao to reach the numinous root. Then yin and yang array themselves swiftly as shooting stars.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nThe lungs govern the qi; the Triple Burner arises,\nConcealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path.\nThe pure fluid, sweet spring, flows through the six viscera,\nFollowing the nose up and down, known to both ears.\nGazing inward at heaven and earth, the Youth is preserved;\nHarmonizing essence and brilliance, teeth and hair are moistened.\nThe complexion glows, radiant without medicine,\nAs the fluid descends the throat—how freely it falls!\nAll spirits gather, seeking one another;\nBelow, in the Crimson Palace, purple blossoms unfold.\nHidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut,\nFocusing the heart-spirit, calling to one another.\nObserving my divine luminosity, it repels all evil,\nThe spleen-spirit returns to its great home.\nReaching the stomach’s passage, it connects to emptiness,\nNurturing the numinous root, never to wither again.\nSealing the Life Gate like a jade capital,\nLongevity extends ten thousand years and more.\n\nThe opening line refers to the internal commentary. To cultivate the lung qi, one must first lie concealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path of ingress and egress. When qi transforms into water, the pure fluid, sweet spring, irrigates the six viscera. This qi, following the nose up and down, bridges the magpie bridge—above as qi, below as fluid. The sound of flowing springs is heard in the void, known to the two ears. Through the work of inner illumination, one gazes at the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, preserving the White Prime Youth to assist the six qi. Harmonizing the essence of the entire body, it moistens teeth and hair, brightens the complexion, and eliminates the need for medicine. The fluid descends the throat like scattered rain; all spirits seek it, and each viscus partakes of its sweetness. Below lies the Crimson Palace, where purple blossoms unfold along the trickling stream. Hidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut. Heart and spirit are two yet one. By focusing the heart-spirit, one ensures the heart calls to the spirit, the spirit calls to the heart—now in the heart, now in the spleen—ever luminous, never dim. Observing my divine luminosity, it truly repels all evil influences. In the spleen, the spleen-spirit returns as if home, always abiding there. Reaching the passage of the stomach, it connects to the realm of emptiness, nurturing the numinous root so it never withers again. All this is the cultivation of lung qi. Yet in this nurturing, one must seal the Life Gate, pure as a jade capital, untouched by dust, all thoughts stilled. Thus the numinous root is fortified, and longevity extends ten thousand years with abundance.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe spirit within the spleen governs the center,\nSummoning the five spirits to harmonize the Three Lights.\nAbove, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light,\nDredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases.\nMetal, wood, water, fire, earth reign as kings;\nSun, moon, and constellations array yin and yang.\nDredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar;\nCultivating the seven apertures dispels misfortune.\nThe two spirits unite to descend jade blossoms,\nReceiving primordial qi, the years grow ever longer.\n\nThe spleen belongs to earth, so its spirit presides over the center. \"Summoning the five spirits\" means gathering the Five Phases; \"harmonizing the Three Lights\" refers to the revolutions of the Dipper, sun, and moon.\n\n**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe phrase *\"Above, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light\"* distills the wondrous workings of the preceding two chapters. The Mysterious Gate awaits the Dao of Heaven—this is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits yin and yang—this, too, is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits the ancient Way—still, it is the spirit of the spleen. *\"Meeting the Hall of Light\"* refers not to the Hall of Light between the brows nor the Crimson Palace, but to the central void of nonbeing. *\"Dredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases\"*—among metal, wood, water, and fire, earth reigns as king. The sun, moon, and constellations harbor yin and yang within; who divides them? The spleen’s spirit governs their unfolding. *\"Dredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar\"* and *\"cultivating the seven apertures to dispel misfortune\"*—all depend on the spleen’s spirit establishing the center, for intention arises from the heart. The *\"two spirits\"* are the spleen’s spirit and the heart’s spirit. *\"Uniting\"* means the two become one. *\"Descending jade blossoms\"* signifies jade liquid irrigating the heart, as earth also generates the yellow sprout. *\"Receiving primordial qi\"* means using qi to nourish spirit, for spirit relies on qi; when qi is full, spirit is complete, and the years grow ever longer.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nAmong the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank,\nConcealed in the Great Yin, they safeguard their truth.\nExiting and entering through the two apertures, they merge with the Yellow Court,\nInhaling and exhaling the void, my form becomes visible.\nThey strengthen my sinews and bones, enriching blood and vessels,\nIn the indistinct and imperceptible, I transcend to pure numinosity.\nSeated within the hut, I observe the youth,\nWith inner breath and focused thought, the light of spirit shines.\nEmerging from the Celestial Gate, I enter the boundless,\nSerene and desireless, I nurture the root of radiance.\nIngesting primordial qi grants longevity,\nReturning to the Seven Gates, I drink from the Great Abyss.\nPassing through the Mysterious Throat, I traverse pure numinosity,\nSeated within the hut, I behold the youth.\nHe asks me of the immortal Dao and wondrous methods—\nI tell him to consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom,\nTo wear white silk upon his head, his feet planted at the Cinnabar Field,\nTo bathe in the Flowery Pond and irrigate the numinous root.\nWhen the five viscera harmonize, the Gate of Life opens,\nThe five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns.\nPracticing this with unbound hair ensures enduring existence.\n\n*The Outer Radiance* concludes the five viscera with the kidneys, returning all to the One. The One is water, governed by the kidneys, so among the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank. The Great Yin belongs to the lungs; *\"concealed in the Great Yin\"* means true metal generates true water, and true water conceals true metal. *\"Exiting and entering through the two apertures\"* refers to the gates of Qian and Kun, the doors of yin and yang—one metal, one water, one going forth, one returning. Their center is called the Yellow Court, the place where metal and water are stored and where exit and entry converge. The center is emptiness; emptiness is nonbeing. Guarding the center in breath, one takes the space between heaven and earth as a bellows, vibrant and fluid, vast and boundless, subtle and continuous, merging into a single whole—round and luminous, with qi and spirit full, so that one’s true form becomes visible. Thereafter, the sinews and bones grow strong, the blood and vessels flourish, and in the indistinct and imperceptible, one’s form vanishes, soaring beyond the realm of pure numinosity to ascend to the Central Elixir. This is the hut of spirit’s light. Seated beneath it, one observes a youth whose appearance mirrors one’s own—yet pay him no mind. Simply guard the inner breath, focus the thought, and the celestial light of wisdom will shine forth, the spirit growing ever brighter. From there, move the spirit to the Upper Elixir, emerging above the Celestial Gate to commune with the single qi of heaven and earth, vast and boundless, clear and empty—this is me yet not me, this is emptiness yet not emptiness. In harmony with the Dao, one enters the boundless, serene and desireless, nurturing the root of radiance. The root of radiance is the immortal seed; immortals abstain from grain, ingesting only the qi of the Mysterious Gate to attain undying longevity. Yet those who consume primordial qi must also guide the spirit inward, returning to the Seven Gates to drink daily from the Great Abyss. In returning, one takes the path of the Mysterious Throat, passing through pure numinosity to sit once more within the hut, where the youth appears again, asking of the immortal Dao and its wondrous methods. I tell him: there is no other wonder. Simply consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom, wear white silk upon your head, plant your feet at the Cinnabar Field, bathe in the Flowery Pond, and irrigate the numinous root. When the five viscera harmonize and a single qi surges in harmony, the Gate of Life opens, the elixir light emerges from the crucible, the five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns to the body. Practicing this with unbound hair—obtaining the medicine, laying the foundation, refining the self, returning the elixir, ascending to the origin, returning to the root, illuminating goodness, and reverting to the beginning—all lies within these few words. This is the immortal Dao and its wondrous method, ensuring enduring existence.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe great Dao flows boundlessly—let not the heart grow tangled.\nMy words are complete; do not recklessly expound them.\n\nHere, Laozi concludes his scripture with two closing exhortations: All that has been spoken above is the great Dao—vast and unobstructed, utterly upright, without crooked paths or deviant byways. Those who practice it must not let their hearts become entangled in complexity and stray onto divergent paths. My words are complete; do not recklessly expound them to the unworthy, lest you bring calamity upon yourself. Treasure and remember them.\n\n**Explanation of the *Classic of Purity***\nLaozi said: The great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth.\nThe Limitless generates the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe great Dao is passionless, revolving the sun and moon.\nIt is non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe great Dao is nameless, nurturing the myriad things.\nNonbeing gives birth to being.\nI know not its name, so I forcefully call it *\"Dao.\"*\nThe character for *\"Dao\"* is formed by combining *\"head\"* and *\"walk\"*—it moves and generates prior to heaven and earth. Though called a forced name, it is nonetheless natural.\nThe Dao possesses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\nWithout pure heaven and turbid earth, there would be no heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness.\nMan is pure, woman turbid; man is active, woman still.\nDescending from the root, flowing to the branches, the myriad things are born.\nPurity and movement are the root; turbidity and stillness are the branches.\nOne descends, one flows, one bestows, one receives.\nWhen purity and turbidity merge, movement and stillness unite in marriage, the myriad things flourish therefrom.\n\nPurity is the source of turbidity. Nonbeing gives rise to being.\nMovement is the foundation of stillness. Being returns to nonbeing.\nIf one can constantly abide in purity and stillness, heaven and earth will all return to it.\nHeaven is pure, earth is still—together they revert entirely to nonbeing.\n\nNow, the spirit of man delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it.\nThe heart that disturbs the spirit is the deluded heart.\nThe human heart delights in stillness, yet desires drag it away.\nTo attain the heart that delights in stillness, one must first relinquish affairs.\nTo still the heart, one must first dispel desires.\nWhen the heart is settled, the spirit becomes clear of itself.\nTo settle the heart is to wash it and withdraw it into concealment.\nWhen the heart is like still water, the spirit becomes clear of itself.\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise;\nwithout eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind,\nthere are no forms, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, or dharmas.\nThe three poisons are extinguished.\nThe three poisons are: the yin spirit that harms human nature,\nthe yin essence that harms human life,\nand the yin qi that assaults the five viscera—these are the three corpses.\nThe three corpses are the yin bandits within the human body.\nThose who speak of the \"three Pengs\" or \"three Gu\" are deluded.\nThe reason one cannot succeed is that the heart is not settled and desires are not dispelled.\nThe spirit cannot become clear because desires have not been dispelled.\nOne who can dispel them inwardly observes the heart, yet the heart is no-heart.\nOne knows that the three minds cannot be grasped.\nOutwardly, one observes form, yet form is no-form.\nFrom afar, one observes things, yet things are no-things.\nOne knows that the four marks are all forgotten.\nWhen these three are awakened to, only emptiness is seen.\nReflecting back, one enters emptiness.\nObserving emptiness, even emptiness is empty.\nWhen observing emptiness reaches the place of no-where,\nemptiness becomes vast.\nIf there is something, it does not become emptiness.\nWhen what is emptied is already nothing, even nothingness is nothing.\nAfter observing emptiness reaches the state of no-where,\neven emptiness is no more.\nIf there is emptiness, it cannot be without something.\nNothingness upon nothingness—even nothingness does not stand.\nWhen nothingness upon nothingness is no more,\nthere is profound and constant stillness.\nAll dharmas are empty.\nStillness without anything to still—how can desires arise?\nStillness upon stillness—what worry, what thought?\nWhen desires do not arise, this is true stillness.\nThis is why stillness must first dispel desires.\n\nTrue constancy responds to things; true constancy abides.\nWhen true stillness is constant, it is called true constancy.\nMy master said:\n*\"True constancy can respond to things,\nresponding to things without delusion,\nwithout delusion, one’s nature naturally abides.\"*\nThis expresses the same meaning.\nConstant response, constant stillness—this is constant purity and stillness.\nThe *Ding Guan* states:\n*\"Whether in affairs or not, always as if without mind.\nWhether in stillness or clamor, one’s resolve remains single.\"*\nThrough such purity and stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao.\nHaving entered the true Dao, it is called attaining the Dao.\nWhen the deluded heart is absent, the true heart is present.\nThough called attaining the Dao, in reality there is nothing attained.\nIt is used with emptiness, never self-satisfied or pretentious.\nFor the sake of transforming sentient beings, it is called attaining the Dao.\nAbandoning delusion and returning to truth—this may be called a Daoist.\nOne who can awaken to this may transmit the sagely Dao.\nWhen the work of nature is awakened, the work of life is transmitted.\n\nSomeone asked:\n*\"Above it is said there is nothing attained, yet here it speaks of transmitting the sagely Dao.\nDoes this mean the *Qing Jing* scripture has not yet spoken of the Dao?\"*\nHanxu replied: Not so. You have misunderstood \"nothing attained.\"\nThis is entering the Dao and reflecting back—it is the wondrous secret of original nature.\nLao Jun said:\n*\"The heart is long, the words are weighty—thus I expound again.\"*\n\nThe superior person engages in no contention; the inferior person delights in contention.\nThe highest virtue does not assert virtue; the lesser virtue clings to virtue.\nThose who cling are not called possessors of the Dao and virtue.\nWithout contention, there are no desires.\nWith contention, desires multiply.\nNot asserting virtue—this is true virtue.\nClinging to virtue—this is no virtue at all.\nWithout perfect virtue, the perfect Dao does not coalesce.\nThose who cling to virtue cannot be expansive—how then could they embody the vast, numinous, and boundless virtue to unite with my vast, numinous, and boundless Dao?\n\nSentient beings fail to attain the true Dao because they harbor deluded minds.\nWith deluded minds, they disturb their spirit.\nDisturbing their spirit, they become attached to the myriad things.\nAttached to the myriad things, they give rise to craving.\nWith craving, there is affliction.\nAffliction and delusion torment body and mind,\nleading to defilement and disgrace, drifting through the cycles of birth and death.\nEver submerged in the sea of suffering, they forever lose the true Dao.\nThis passage employs reverse exposition to reinforce the meaning of entering the true Dao through purity and stillness.\n\nYet what is lamentable is this: with restless, deluded minds, they agitate the utterly pure true spirit.\nAttached to things and lost in delusion, the heart cannot be still—\nthe true spirit is instead transformed into a deluded mind.\nHow then could they attain the Dao?\n\nThe ever-true Dao is attained through awakening.\nThose who awaken to the Dao abide in constant purity and stillness.\nThe awakened never depart from purity and stillness.\nThe method of purity and stillness never departs from dispelling desire.\nDispelling desire is the crucial point of this chapter.\nMoreover, when the heart is still, fire descends; when the spirit is clear, qi becomes wise.\nWisdom arises in samadhi, and the original destiny naturally returns.\nThere is also that which arises spontaneously, beyond knowing how or why.\n\n*Commentary on the Jade Pivot Scripture*\nAnnotations by Xuanyi Hanxuzi\n\nDwelling at the center and revolving—this is called the *pivot*. The first star of the Northern Dipper is named *Celestial Pivot*, for it revolves from the center. In the human body, the spirit serves as the pivot; when not a speck of dust clings to it, it is as luminously pure as jade—hence the name *Jade Pivot*. The great purport of this scripture is to teach people to refine the primordial spirit.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: “You, all gods and humans, wish to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, not to be found elsewhere. Since you wish to hear it, the one who does not hear is the one. Without hearing, without seeing—this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing must be dissolved; only you remain, yet you are not a thing, how much less so this?”\n\nClear as ice and bright as snow, no further explanation is needed. The word *this* refers to hearing, seeing, and speech.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, preserved through silence, and employed through softness. Employing sincerity appears as foolishness; employing silence appears as inarticulateness; employing softness appears as clumsiness. Thus one may forget form, may forget even forgetting. All these are the workings within emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThose who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who preserve the Dao know how to be reverent; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom-light arises; knowing reverence, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, great stability and peace are attained. With great stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom-light arises; with wisdom-light arising, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting.\n\nOnly in forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten, does the supreme Dao reside. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient beings are ultimately one and without duality.”\n\nTo enter, one must be able to preserve; to preserve, one must be able to employ. Knowing when to stop, one does not stray; knowing reverence, one does not deviate; knowing subtlety, one deeply enters the profound and obscure. From the profound and obscure arises the indistinct and vague, where numinous awareness attaches—this is wisdom-light. Not deviating, the spirit is tranquil; not straying, qi is still. When qi is still, the spirit is tranquil; when the spirit is tranquil, within the Great Void a single spirit moves alone, knowing only the Dao and nothing else—thus it is said: “This is called true forgetting.” True forgetting is forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten. True forgetting is the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “In this present world, how shall I benefit living beings? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend to the immortal’s throne.\n\nDisciples of the Dao, know that there is *qi* and *number*. As wind and earth differ, so too do endowments naturally vary—hence it is called *qi*. As wisdom and foolishness differ, so too do purity and turbidity naturally vary—hence it is called *number*. Number is tied to destiny; qi is tied to heaven. Constrained by qi and number, destiny is bound (bound, as in fettered), and the true Dao cannot be attained. Foolishness may become wisdom; turbidity may become purity—only destiny decrees it. Foolishness is dim; turbidity is dark—these too are shaped by the endowments of wind and earth, which shift and transform.\n\nHeaven and earth move their mechanism, causing people not to know—this is called *spontaneity*. Even when one knows that one does not know, it is still called *spontaneity*. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, arises precisely from not knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun with foolishness or turbidity.”\n\nAll gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.\n\n*Summary of the Scripture on Protecting Life*\n\nAt that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was within the Fivefold-Luminous Palace of the Seven-Jewel Grove, together with the boundless assembly of sages, radiating boundless light that illuminated the boundless worlds. He beheld the boundless sentient beings enduring boundless suffering, tossed and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, adrift in the river of love, blown about in the sea of desire, sunk in the mire of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence. There is no emptiness, yet emptiness; no form, yet form; no non-existence, yet non-existence. There is existence, yet no existence. From beginning to end, all is dark and obscure, unable to illumine themselves, utterly lost in delusion.\n\nThe beginningless is the ancestral qi. When ancestral qi transforms and engenders, the true spirit is revealed. This spirit resides within the heart of heaven, inside the Yellow Court. When the one spirit is rightly positioned, the ten thousand spirits pay homage. It is not like the boundless sentient beings, who are all but a single stream of consciousness-spirit, enduring endless suffering in the destinies. Those sentient beings are all clinging to delusion. Clinging to emptiness is wrong; clinging to form is wrong; clinging to existence within non-existence is wrong; clinging to non-existence within existence is also wrong. How pitiable indeed!\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: “You sentient beings arise from non-existence into existence, from non-nothingness into nothingness, from non-form into form, from non-emptiness into emptiness. Existence is not made existence; nothingness is not made nothingness; form is not made form; emptiness is not made emptiness. Emptiness is just emptiness, yet emptiness has no fixed emptiness. Form is just form, yet form has no fixed form. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. If you can know that emptiness is not emptiness and that form is not form, this is called illumination, the beginning of attaining the wondrous sound. Recognizing the dharma of no-emptiness, perceiving without obstruction, entering the gate of manifold wonders, you will naturally awaken. Free from the net of doubts, not attached to the view of emptiness—this passage breaks through the delusion of emptiness, form, existence, and non-existence for sentient beings. If any sentient being awakens to this, they will be able to leave all delusions behind. Purifying the six senses, cutting off evil obstructions, I shall then expound for you this wondrous scripture, called *Protecting Life*. It delivers and saves sentient beings, spreads the teaching in the world, and circulates through recitation. Then flying heavenly deities, vajra warriors who shatter evil, dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverers from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts—each in hundreds of millions—will all attend and guard this scripture. Wherever it is revered, they will ward off danger, support the weak, and deliver all sentient beings from defilements and attachments.”\n\nThis passage emphasizes purity once more. Only by purifying the six senses can one attain this wondrous treasure of *Protecting Life* and leave behind all suffering.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gatha:\n*“Seeing yet not seeing me,\nHearing yet not hearing me.\nDeparting from all extremes—\nThis is called the wondrous Dao.”*\n\nNot seeing me, not hearing me—then there is no self. The self is the harm of all extremes; without self, all extremes are departed. Confucius had no prejudices, no inflexibility, no obstinacy, and thus returned to no-self. For with no-self, prejudices, inflexibility, and obstinacy all cease.\n\n*Summary of the Scripture on Daily Practice*\nDaily practice refers to what cannot be departed from even for a moment in the twelve hours. Where there is effort, there will be efficacy—all depends on purifying body and mind. The scripture contains two passages: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity,” and at the end: “In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” This is the crucial point for the followers of the Most High, hence it is reiterated. In the twelve hours, purity must constantly be cultivated as the foundation of daily practice. The scripture’s language is clear and requires no further annotation.\n\nRespectfully noted by Xiyue of the Mysterious Lineage.\n\nAs for daily practice: when eating and drinking, be settled. Seal the mouth, sit upright, and do not arouse a single thought. Forget all things, preserve the spirit, and stabilize the intent. The eyes do not see objects; the ears do not hear sounds. The mind is inwardly guarded, regulating the breath continuously, exhaling gently without interruption, as if present yet absent. Naturally, the heart-fire descends, the kidney-water ascends, saliva is generated in the mouth, and the numinous true essence attaches to the body, attaining the path to longevity.\n\nThe first passage speaks of the initial effort: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity.” Not arousing a single thought is called purity; the numinous terrace being empty of things is called clarity. The body is the dwelling of qi; the mind is the abode of spirit. Where intent moves, spirit moves; where spirit moves, qi scatters. When spirit gathers, the five phases’ true qi coalesces into the elixir pellet, and naturally, within the body there is another body. The harmonious qi penetrates, and the finest essence showers upon the crown. In movement, stillness, sitting, and lying down, one constantly feels the body as if the wind is passing, the abdomen as if thunder is rumbling, the ears hearing the music of immortals without strings. Without speech, there is sound; without striking, there is resonance. Spirit and qi intertwine, the infant revolves. One perceives inner visions, can speak of oneself, sees the affairs of the formless, and dwells with the sages. Spirit moves in and out freely, and one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth, transcending birth and death.\n\nThe two lines “In the twelve hours” refer to the time of entering the chamber, when body and mind are pure, and efficacy naturally manifests. All that follows lies within these two lines. Do not allow any harm—“In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit. Like a hen brooding over her eggs, can one preserve spirit and nurture qi without separation? Wondrous! Wondrous!\n\nWithin the \"twelve hours,\" these two lines are reiterated, now speaking of the time of nurturing the elixir. Observing the four characters \"lest there be harm,\" one understands.\n\n*Brief Explanation of the* **Great Permeation Sutra** *by Hanxuzi*\n\n\"Great Permeation\" signifies the meaning of vastness and all-encompassing penetration. Within the *Sutra*, formlessness, bodilessness, imagelessness, signlessness, and non-action—all are boundlessly vast, unimpeded in their penetration.\n\n**Chapter on True Emptiness**\nIt arises before heaven yet is formless in its arising.\nIt abides after heaven yet is bodiless in its abiding.\nYet in its bodilessness, it has never truly abided.\nThus it is said: \"Inconceivable.\"\nThe qi of pre-heaven has no substance; the spirit of post-heaven has no direction.\nYet though spirit has no direction, its transformations operate within direction.\nThus it is said: \"It has never truly abided.\" \"Inconceivable\"—its wondrous function is inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter on Profound Principle**\nStillness is its nature, and the heart resides within it.\nActivity is the heart, and nature resides within it.\nWhen the heart arises, nature vanishes; when the heart ceases, nature appears.\nLike space devoid of images, it is serene and perfectly full.\nStillness is nature, and the heart resides within it.\nWhen all is forgotten, nature is settled, and the heart too is settled.\nActivity is the heart, and nature also resides within it.\nWith solitary awareness, the heart perceives, and nature too is perceived.\nThe reason ordinary people do not perceive nature is the presence of deluded thoughts.\nWith deluded thoughts, nature is concealed.\nWithout deluded thoughts, nature is revealed.\nFor the substance of nature is fundamentally empty.\nLike space devoid of images, the substance of nature is serene.\n\n**Chapter on the Profound and Wondrous**\nThe Great Dao is signless, thus it inwardly gathers what exists.\nTrue nature is non-active, thus it outwardly does not generate the heart.\nIt is thus of itself, boundlessly vast.\nConfronting circumstances yet forgetting circumstances, it does not sink into the demons of the six thieves.\nDwelling in the dust yet transcending the dust, it does not fall into the transformations of the ten thousand conditions.\nAttaining stillness without movement, attaining harmony without change.\nWisdom illumines the ten directions, emptily transforming without action.\n\n*Verse:*\nWith form, one awakens to formlessness;\nWithout cultivation, one dissolves cultivation.\nIt embraces the bodies of the ten thousand images,\nYet clings not to a single thread.\n\nSignless, thus without existence—by inwardly gathering what exists, one returns to the Dao of signlessness.\nNon-active, thus without heart—by outwardly not generating the heart, one reverts to the nature of non-action.\nGathering existence to return to non-existence is signlessness; collecting the heart to return to nature is non-action.\nSignless and non-active, thus boundlessly vast.\nFrom this, when confronting circumstances and dwelling in the dust, one may seem to perceive signs and action.\nYet without sinking or falling, one still perceives signlessness and non-action.\nWhat concern are the six thieves and ten thousand conditions?\nStillness without movement is concentration; harmony without change is tranquility.\nWisdom illumines and emptily transforms—thus the primordial spirit operates wondrously.\nIn essence, it is signless and non-active.\n\n*Brief Explanation of the* **Ancient Red Writings of the Cavern**\n\n**Chapter on Holding to the Real**\nMovement within movement arises from non-movement.\nAction within action arises from non-action.\nMovement within movement is yang qi.\nIt arises from quiescent stillness, thus it is said: \"arises from non-movement.\"\nAction within action is returning and restoring.\nIt is practiced within purity and stillness, thus it is said: \"arises from non-action.\"\nIn non-action, spirit returns; when spirit returns, the ten thousand things are quiescent.\nIn non-movement, qi dissolves; when qi dissolves, the ten thousand things are born.\nIn non-action, spirit returns—for spirit delights in purity.\nWhen spirit returns, things are quiescent—for purity is stillness.\nIn non-movement, qi dissolves—for qi enters *hai*.\nWhen qi dissolves, things are born—for *hai* becomes *zi*.\nSpirit guards spirit; things rely on things—their root returns to the origin.\nWhat guards is non-union in non-union.\nWhat relies is return in return.\nThus, the post-heaven returns to the pre-heaven, and the root is firmly established.\nIn silence, one awakens; I myself recognize it—entering the seamless.\nSilent awakening is the arising of the dim and obscure.\n\"I myself recognize it\" is solitary awareness.\nThus one deeply enters the profound and permeating, without obstruction.\nNeither dying nor living, one becomes one with heaven and earth.\nThe Dao of holding to the real is attained.\n\n**Chapter on Entering Sagehood**\nForgetting the eyes, light overflows boundlessly.\nForgetting the ears, the heart’s knowledge abides in the profound.\nWhen both mechanisms are forgotten, the gate to all wonders is cut off.\nWhen the mechanism of the eyes is still, wisdom-light naturally arises.\nWhen the mechanism of the ears is still, the heart-ground naturally clarifies.\nTo observe wonders without desire—this is the moment.\nAttaining this one wonder, all wonders are cut off in emptiness.\nPure and complete, it accords with the great square.\nVast and boundless, it accords with the measureless.\nThe greatness of heaven and earth is what I sustain.\nThe multitude of the ten thousand things is what I uphold.\nHow can there be an end, to speak of its limitations?\nThere is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth.\nVast without directional form, lofty without equal measure.\nHeaven and earth, the ten thousand things—all are what I sustain.\nThough there be those who speak well, none can fathom its limitations, for it is inexhaustible.\nWhat is finite in the world has limitations to speak of.\nThe Dao is without end—how can there be limitations to speak of?\n\n**Chapter on Abiding in the World**\nNurture its imagelessness, and images thus endure.\nGuard its bodilessness, and the body thus preserves the real.\nWhen the real is fully preserved and mutually aided, one can be long-lasting.\nHeaven attains its real and thus is eternal; earth attains its real and thus is enduring; humans attain their real and thus are long-lived.\nThe reason worldly people cannot be long-lasting is that they lose their imagelessness and scatter their bodilessness, unable to make the nine orifices and hundred bones coexist with the real body—thus they die.\nImagelessness is qi.\nBodilessness is spirit.\nWhen spirit unites with qi, the elixir path is naturally accomplished.\nThus it is said: \"When the real is fully preserved and mutually aided, one can be long-lasting.\"\nThe following nine sentences are clear and easily understood; annotations are omitted here.\n\n*Brief Explanation of the* **Sutra of Concentrated Contemplation*\n\nPurple Radiance Permeating the Void Master respectfully expounds *Concentrated Contemplation*, which embodies the Buddhist principle of *śamatha-vipaśyanā*. Contemplation here encompasses internal observation, external observation, distant observation, and observation of emptiness. If one can practice concentrated contemplation, the spirit remains unshaken, enabling internal observation of the mindless, external observation of the formless, distant observation of the objectless, and observation of emptiness as emptiness itself.\n\n*The Complete Collection of Daoist Texts* includes annotations by Master Harmonious Simplicity, but his explanations are fragmented and fail to clarify the essential meaning. Here, the exposition follows the original scriptural intent.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: \"Left\" (zuǒ) means to assist, to aid—one who assists in the mysterious work. As the *Book of Documents* states, \"The Duke of Zhou assisted the former kings,\" where \"assist\" (zuǒ) is read in the departing tone, meaning \"to aid.\" If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, one must first relinquish worldly affairs. Sever all external matters that conflict with the heart—external matters being those unrelated to body and mind. \"Conflict\" (wǔ) means opposition, which breeds affliction; thus, one must first abandon and entirely sever such matters to prevent the arising of afflictive thoughts. Only then may one sit in tranquility and inwardly observe the arising of the mind. If even a single thought arises, it must be eradicated to ensure stillness. Here, \"thought\" refers to those with attachment. As Buddhist scriptures state, one must work at the point where the mind stirs and thoughts arise; thus, they must be removed and extinguished. Even if the thoughts are not explicitly attached but are merely wandering and chaotic, they too must be entirely eradicated. One must practice diligently day and night without the slightest lapse.\n\n\"Explicit attachment\" refers to the aforementioned \"thoughts,\" such as those for fame and profit. \"Wandering and chaotic thoughts\" are those without attachment, arising aimlessly, drifting and ceaseless, disordered and inconsequential. \"Lapse\" means abandonment. One must extinguish the moving mind but not the illuminating mind. One should congeal the empty mind but not fixate the abiding mind. Without relying on any single method, the mind remains constantly settled. \"Thought\" is the moving mind; \"illumination\" is the mind of reflexive observation; \"emptiness\" is the desireless mind; \"abiding\" is the mind of attachment. \"Not relying on any single method\" means that all things are empty, yet the mind remains perpetually settled.\n\nHowever, the mundane mind is restless and competitive. To conclude the above: For beginners, calming the mind is exceedingly difficult. Even if one momentarily succeeds, the mind soon strays again. The struggle between departure and retention causes the entire body to circulate restlessly. Only through prolonged and focused reflection can one achieve mastery. Do not abandon the endeavor of a thousand lifetimes because of a momentary failure to collect the mind. \"Calming the mind\" is what Buddhists call \"pacifying the mind.\" \"Momentarily succeeding but soon straying\" is what Confucians describe as \"maintaining when present, losing when absent.\" When lost, it departs; when departed, it is drawn by external conditions. When maintained, it remains; when it remains, it returns to the mind. The interplay of mind and conditions resembles a battle. Following the breath's ebb and flow, it is said: \"The hundred parts of the body circulate.\" To achieve the method of retention, one must ponder the principle of harmonizing the mind. There is nothing that does not proceed from the temporary to the constant; through prolonged and focused reflection, one can achieve mastery. Initially, one may temporarily collect the mind, but subsequently, it abides constantly. The endeavor of a thousand lifetimes refers to the constantly abiding mind mentioned above.\n\nOnce one has attained a measure of stillness, then in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—in all places of engagement and amidst clamor—one must intentionally cultivate calm. Whether occupied or unoccupied, one should remain as if mindless. In quietude or in noise, one's resolve should be singular. \"Measure\" means \"slightly\"; \"attained\" means \"ceased.\" Having slightly attained stillness, one must test it in various conditions to observe whether the mind remains unmoved. Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, quietude, and noise—all are conditions. \"Intentionally\" means to establish and maintain. The four phrases regarding occupation, non-occupation, movement, and noise all describe intentional effort.\n\nIf one binds the mind too tightly, the tension may cause illness. The arising of qi may lead to madness and frenzy—these are its symptoms. The mind tends toward movement, and restraining it too forcefully will result in violent and agitated illness. Qi here refers to the qi within the mind; when the mind moves, qi moves. \"Madness\" is the symptom of violence; \"frenzy\" is the symptom of agitation. Madness is minor; violence and agitation are severe. If the mind does not move, one must allow it freedom. When tension and relaxation are balanced, one naturally remains harmoniously adjusted. To restrain without attachment, to release without movement, to remain unperturbed in noise, and to remain unagitated in engagement—this is true concentration. \"Balanced\" means appropriate. \"Naturally harmoniously adjusted\" means to be at ease, free, and unhurried. \"Without attachment or movement\" is the balance of tension and relaxation. \"Unperturbed and unagitated\" is natural harmony. \"True concentration\" is perpetual stillness.\n\nDo not seek more engagement because one remains unagitated amidst affairs, nor seek noise because one remains unperturbed in clamor. Regard the absence of affairs as one's true dwelling and the presence of affairs as responsive traces. Like water or a mirror serving as a reflection, one manifests forms in accordance with things. Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration. How can one know that seeking more affairs will not generate agitation, or that forcibly seeking noise will not produce perturbation? \"True dwelling\" refers to the realm of stillness; \"responsive traces\" refers to the realm of movement. \"Skillful means\" means responding to things with the mind, which is the responsive trace. Constant response and constant stillness both aim to achieve the work of concentration. Thus, it is said: \"Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration.\"\n\nThe arising of wisdom may be swift or slow, but this does not depend on the individual. Do not urgently seek wisdom within concentration, for urgency harms one's nature, and harm precludes wisdom. If, without seeking wisdom in concentration, wisdom arises naturally, such concentration is called true wisdom. If wisdom is not employed, true insight resembles foolishness, further enriching concentration and wisdom, both of which attain boundless excellence. Wisdom arises from concentration and follows its natural course. To use wisdom is not wisdom; not using it is wisdom. Cultivating both concentration and wisdom brings limitless joy.\n\nIf thoughts arise during concentration, one may attract numerous demonic influences. Malevolent spirits and myriad specters will manifest in accordance with the mind. The visions of Heavenly Worthies, immortals, and venerable figures are auspicious signs.\n\nSigns: omens. Ancient scholars distinguished between auspicious signs and ominous signs; here, the latter is meant. Only when the mind in concentration is suddenly open and unobstructed above, vast and foundationless below, will past karma daily dissolve and new karma cease to form. Unentangled and free, one escapes the cage of the dusty world. With long practice, the Dao is naturally attained. Above, no obstruction; below, no foundation—nothing but emptiness. This represents an advanced stage in concentration practice, echoing the earlier scripture’s teaching: “Observe emptiness as empty; how can desire arise?”\n\nThose who attain the Dao exhibit seven progressive signs. First, the mind easily enters concentration (governs itself), becoming aware of all sensory leaks. Second, chronic illnesses vanish entirely, and body and mind feel light and refreshed. Third, premature depletion is replenished, restoring vitality and lifespan. Fourth, one lives for thousands of years, known as an immortal. Fifth, one refines form into qi, known as a perfected person. Sixth, one refines qi into spirit, known as a spirit person. Seventh, one refines spirit to merge with the Dao, known as a realized person. Discernment sharpens with each stage. Upon attaining the supreme Dao, wisdom becomes complete—completeness meaning all seven stages have been traversed.\n\nIf, after long practice in concentration, the body shows none of these signs—if one’s brief, impure life fades and perishes, yet claims to possess awakened wisdom or to have attained the Dao—then the principles of the Dao remain unrealized.\n\nA verse explains:\nKnowing arises from conditions,\nas fire arises from causes.\nEach is the movement of true nature,\nyet following the current, the source of the Dao is lost.\nStriving to still knowing with the mind,\nknowing arises and the mind grows more troubled.\nRealizing that nature is fundamentally empty,\nknowing becomes the gateway to all wonders.\n\nThis scripture guides people in cultivating the mind to enter the Dao, its compassion thorough and all-embracing. Here, the meaning is elucidated in accordance with the text to reveal its earnest intent.\n\n*Inscription by Hanxu*\n\n**Commentary on the *Five Kitchens Sutra***\n*(The sutra employs a five-character classical verse structure, which is highly intricate, hence this detailed exposition.)*\n\n**Original text annotated by Shi Zihanxu**\n\nThe Tang dynasty Perfected Master Yin Min of the Su Ming Abbey in the capital stated: “When one preserves the primordial qi in harmonious balance, the five viscera become full and the five spirits settle into correctness. When the five viscera are full, flavors are sufficient; when the five spirits are settled, cravings disappear.” This scripture addresses the nourishment of the five viscera, as if seeking food from a kitchen—hence the title *Five Kitchens*.\n\nWhen the primordial qi is harmoniously balanced, the One Dao is entirely at peace. Harmony itself is without singular harmony, its profound principle merging with the profound boundary. The “primordial qi” refers to the precelestial One Qi. “Harmonious balance” means uniting the disharmonious qi within the five viscera. Once the qi of the five viscera is harmonized, the One Qi becomes the Dao’s qi, and thus the entire body is pervaded by harmonious qi. When the body is filled with harmonious qi, that qi circulates fully, vast and boundless, leaving no singular harmony to be named.\n\nPrinciple: nature, wherein life resides. Boundary: intersection, where two profundities cannot be separated. When the profound intersects with the profound, each rectifies its nature and life, preserving the Great Harmony.\n\nDo not employ the mind to pursue thought, nor seek thoughtlessness. When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus. The latter “mind” refers to true intention—wisdom’s light. “Do not employ the mind to pursue thought” means that at the intersection of the two profundities, the arising of wisdom is not subject to human control; one must not urgently seek wisdom in concentration. Yet neither should one seek thoughtlessness. Instead, one should attend to the center of the circle, forgetting yet not forgetting, not forgetting yet forgetting. In the space between intention and non-intention, the One Qi arises and wisdom’s light appears—this is the proper practice. Thus it is said: “When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus.”\n\nDo not use the mind to contemplate the mind,\nnor cling to the absence of contemplation.\nWhen the mind is present, do not fixate on the mind;\nin truth, guard the abyss of truth.\n\nDo not use the inwardly illuminating mind to externally contemplate the mind of human desire, so that inner thoughts do not leak out and outer thoughts do not intrude. Having established a mind free from external contemplation, do not cling to the mind of absolute detachment. This means one must allow for appropriate flexibility, naturally adjusting, regulating without attachment, releasing without disturbance. The mind resides within, yet do not fixate on a mind that is within, lest it become bound by the Dharma. Simply abide in true constancy, silently guarding the deep abyss—what the *Cantong Qi* calls “floating and wandering, guarding the center of the circle.”\n\nCultivate principle, detach from intention;\naccumulated cultivation does not align with detachment.\nWhen intention is not cultivated,\none’s own karma remains unknown.\n\nIn cultivating one’s nature, first uphold intention, then detach from it. Upholding intention ensures focus; detaching from it entrusts intention to emptiness. If one forcefully cultivates nature by rigidly upholding intention, this is called an extreme view, inevitably leading to fixation and conflicting with the principle of detachment. To uphold intention without upholding it, to maintain it subtly—this is the cultivation of one’s own karma, free from personal views, naturally at ease, tranquil and effortless, thus achieving purity and non-action.\n\nAll who consume qi bind qi,\nbut not those who have long stabilized it.\nQi returns to its original qi;\ntake it as it comes, release it as it goes.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Scripture* states: “All people consume grains and the five flavors, but only the perfected consume the harmonious qi of yin and yang.” From this, we understand that those who consume flavors to nourish qi merely sustain temporarily bound qi, which waxes and wanes—unlike the harmonious qi of the One, which abides long and stabilizes within. Within the five viscera, each possesses harmony as its foundation. The realized person gathers the five qi into a cauldron. When the One Qi arises within the cauldron, it returns to the source of each qi. I take it as it comes and release it as it goes. Taking it, the five qi return to the origin; releasing it, the hundred bones are all regulated.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* speaks of \"yellow-centered, penetrating principle, rightly positioned within the body—its beauty lies within, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in deeds and enterprises: this is the perfection of beauty.\" *Xie* (泄) here means \"to flow forth.\"\n\nThe *Luminous Mirror Casket Scripture* states: The luminous mirror casket reveals the subtle workings of the Yellow and White, like a precious mirror drawn from its case—radiant, clear, and bright. Its essence lies in quicksilver alone; its method begins with the death of quicksilver, and its foundation lies in first refining the true earth. The Most High, in great compassion, has directly inscribed the essential principles of the Great Elixir upon bamboo and silk. If one can reach the heavens with utmost sincerity, a Perfected One of the Great Clarity will surely break open these subtle words, and all methods will become clear. The laws of immortality are most strict; I dare not rashly annotate them. I humbly reveal the essential wonders of the true scripture within these marks and circles.\n\nThe world does not recognize the One—yet from the One Qi, the myriad things are born. If one knows the One and pursues it, attaining the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nThe One is the foundation of water, continuing as the Wood of the East. *Gui*-lead gives rise to *Xin*-metal, white and lustrous as jade. The Two is the essence of fire, unerringly the father of the *Geng* direction. *Ren*-water generates yellow gold, and gold becomes the Earth of the Central Palace. Yellow gold is the father of cinnabar; white gold is the mother of quicksilver. The essence of *Ren* and *Gui* waters—recognize them as *Wu* and *Ji*. Black lead is not true lead, for within it lies the primordial water. Cinnabar is not true mercury, for within it lies the mysterious primordial fire. When water and fire achieve mutual completion, they do not stray from the Earth of the *Kun* direction. The true mother, if not spiritually attuned, must be supplemented with the correct yang. Extracting *Kan* to restore *Li*, all things return to the primordial ancestor.\n\nThe *Kun* mother nurtures the infant boy; the *Qian* father nurtures the pregnant girl. The maiden weds the infant boy, and they unite as husband and wife. Water and fire coalesce into a single mass, and the couple naturally regard each other. Male and female then conjoin their essences, and from their union, sons and daughters are born. Without a father, a mother cannot form; without a mother, a father is not permitted. When father and mother embody the true form, they do not lose the true Dragon and Tiger. Dragon and Tiger are the Yellow Sprout; the Yellow Sprout is the true earth. True earth is the supreme medicine; the supreme medicine does not depart from the ancestor. Departing from the ancestor, the Elixir cannot form—forming the Elixir is the true principle.\n\nA hen cannot hatch chicks if there is a mother but no father. In vain she broods over single eggs; the qi scatters, and no offspring are born. If you wish to kill quicksilver, you must first kill its mother. When the mother dies and unites with the mysterious primordial, she may then pair with the cinnabar father. Only when father and mother conjoin their true essences is the quicksilver child put to death. Dead quicksilver becomes lead, akin to the Earth of the *Kun* direction. *Kun* earth nurtures the infant boy, transforming into the mother of quicksilver. Quicksilver is but a single substance, never departing from the fire of the South.\n\nIn the *Qian* palace dwells the Vermilion Bird; in the *Kun* palace dwells the Dark Warrior. The Dark Warrior produces *Kun* silver; the Vermilion Bird transforms into yellow earth. Only when they converge in the Central Palace is quicksilver put to death. The Northern Dipper is the pivot of heaven, containing within it the water of the Central Palace. When the Four Symbols gather in the Central Palace, South and North become *Wu* and *Ji*. True essence gives rise to *Qian* and *Kun*; lead and mercury are father and mother. Father and mother are *Geng* and *Xin*, truly endowed with the number of the Southwest. Recognize the essence of *Geng* and *Xin*, and you may then refine the earth of the Central Palace. True earth is produced within it, and only then does it govern the central water.\n\nIf one recognizes true mercury, within yellow gold lies the spirit-fire. If one recognizes true lead, within white gold lies the spirit-water. When the two qi conjoin to form the Elixir, one need not fear the death of quicksilver. If one does not recognize water and fire, how can one understand the principle of *Qian*-mercury? Damp earth cannot dry water; dry earth can restrain water. If one knows the mechanism of generation and destruction, one grasps the principle of the Returned Elixir.\n\nYellow gold is true fire; white gold is true water. How many elixir-refiners have become lost ghosts! *Ji*-earth is not true sulfur; *Wu*-earth is not celestial *Gui*. If one takes these as earth, one does not recognize the subtleties within. Quicksilver must mutually generate; quicksilver must be born and die. To kill quicksilver, one must first kill its mother.\n\nThe essence of prior-heaven *Qian* and *Kun* is the true *Wu* and *Ji*. *Qian* is yellow, *Kun* is white—yellow and white are medicines beyond compare. Use only the essence of yellow and white, not their physical forms. How is the essence of yellow and white obtained? Use only cinnabar as its match. When cinnabar dies and turns red, only then is quicksilver put to death. Quicksilver cannot fly—here lies the formation of the medicine. If immortals obtain this essence, they steal from heaven and earth. If worldly people obtain this essence, they amass gold and become wealthy. From one revolution to nine revolutions, nine times nine is eighty-one. If one understands this principle, one must firmly and secretly secure it. Conceal it without speech, and one ascends to the rank of immortals. If obtained, broadly aid others; if not obtained, do not waste it in vain. If one carelessly reveals this, even the celestial spirits will be displeased. Be cautious, again and again—these are a thousand words, ten thousand phrases.\n\nThe *Golden Valley Scripture*:\nThe *Golden Valley Song* clarifies the method of planting the medicine. The Great Elixir is like a grain of millet, first sown in the Jade Field. Cultivate, harvest, and reap the golden grain to consume it. Its essence lies in working within lead; its use lies in quicksilver alone.\n\nThe Elixir-Refining Formula, the Elixir-Refining Formula—listen carefully as I explain to you:\nThe mother qi first transmits to the child; the first child’s nature is still unrefined. The second child is likewise; in chaos, they are hard to distinguish. The third child begins to shine, transformed and divided into hardness and decisiveness. One child gives birth to another, and the nine children are fierce in nature. Ascending in purity to the Great Void, celestial immortals come to welcome you.\n\nThis Elixir conveys the supreme Dao—do not speak of it to the unworthy.\nElixir, Elixir, Elixir—a single grain grants longevity for ten thousand kalpas.\nOne gives rise to two, two to three, three to the myriad things without end.\nWithout karmic affinity, one cannot encounter this Elixir Scripture—this is the true oral transmission of the sages.\n\nThe crucible has no head; the cauldron has no ears.\n*Geng* is the exterior; *Xin* is the interior.\nThere are no other medicines to take—only water and fire paired together.\nSwallows do not hatch phoenixes; solitary hares do not nurse horses.\nWithout true father and mother, all that is born is false.\nTo plant grain, one must use millet—without millet, no grain will grow.\n\nRefining the Elixir requires treasures—without treasures, the Elixir will not form.\nIf one uses common or杂 substances, all will fail to be true.\nUse lead yet do not use lead—one must work within the lead.\nWhen it comes to using lead, to use lead is still mistaken.\nIf one wishes mercury to die, first one must kill the mercury.\nIf mercury does not die, how can mercury die?\nRaw and cooked mutually restrain each other; through restraint, they naturally attain numinosity.\nBlack and red cinnabar and mercury congeal—know clearly this principle is most profound.\nIt does not depart from male and female begetting male and female; the male and female begotten give rise to further descendants.\nMercury is one thing, yet nothing else—first it becomes flesh, then it becomes bone.\nBone and flesh intimately transform into the true; from this, the river chariot may freely reverse.\nThis medicine has no furnace, only a crucible—a single crucible transforms into ten thousand crucibles.\nGold transforms into gold, silver into silver—when was there ever another external spirit?\nAfter three cycles of turning, refining, and parting the embryo, one even scorns the ancestral lineage as clamor and dust.\nThe medicine is gold, and gold is the medicine—the mother’s power to nurture the child runs deep.\nThe pregnant woman must be securely concealed within the chamber of spirit; reared in the inner chamber, her resolve naturally hardens.\nJade fields and golden valleys are sown in due season—I now expound this with utmost clarity.\nIf one obtains a person to guard it, one should keep it secret and hidden; if not secret and hidden, one will incur Heaven’s wrath.\n\n*Commentary on \"The Rootless Tree Lyrics\"*\n*Annotated by Liu Wuyuan of Mount Qiyun*\n\nLi Hanxu of Changyi Mountain’s Commentary\n\nPreface\n\nThe *Wuzhen* of Tiantai elucidates the great matter of returning to the origin through both inner and outer medicines. Yet in its time, those of shallow understanding and ignorance mistook it for a text on furnace fires and sexual arts. Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp the principle of returning, further appended superficial doctrines of purity to ride its fame. Weng Baoguang, upon reading it, laughed and said, “This is one who knows nothing of the Golden Elixir.” He then composed annotations to correct it. Lu Ziye and Chen Shangyang expanded upon it, and with the emergence of the three commentaries on *Wuzhen*, Ye’s annotations were soon buried.\n\nMaster Zhang Sanfeng of Liaoyang was a celestial immortal. During his time in Wudang, he composed *Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree*, a work peerless with Ziyang’s *Wuzhen*, though the world also misconstrued it as concerning sexual arts and furnace fires. Hanxu declared with clarity, “The Dao does not prevail because the Dao is not made clear.” He longed to compose an exegesis to illuminate it but lamented the lack of like-minded alchemical companions.\n\nLiu Wuyuan of Qiyun, with his vast and discerning talent, authored dozens of works transmitted to the world. Among them was *Annotations on the Rootless Tree*. Hanxu obtained and examined it, finding its diction profound and its principles perfectly harmonious. Thereupon, he rejoiced greatly, for it had anticipated what his own heart had long affirmed. Where Liu’s work left some matters unexhausted, Hanxu supplemented them, revealing without omission the inner and outer medicines, the fire phases of returning, and the sequence of furnaces and crucibles. Thus, the two commentaries on *The Rootless Tree* stand as the three annotations to *Wuzhen*.\n\nHaving completed the commentary, he asked me for a preface. Though I am unworthy, I record here the depth of his intent.\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Qingxia Cave’s Master, along with his fellow disciple He Xifu, on the day of the Beginning of Autumn in the year *dingwei*.\n\nTwo Lyrics on *The Rootless Tree* to the Tune of *Zhegu Tian*\nSelf-Composed by the Author\n\nThe Dao’s methods circulate—some orthodox, some heterodox;\nThose who stray from orthodoxy and embrace the perverse spread across the earth.\nRarely seen is the phoenix soaring through the clouds,\nWhile many, sunk in delusion, become frogs fallen into wells.\nHard to distinguish, the clamor grows chaotic—\nAll mistake red earth for cinnabar.\nTo know the true path that penetrates the mysterious,\nStudy closely the blossoms beneath the Rootless Tree.\n\n*To the Tune of \"Selling Flowers\"*\nBeneath the Rootless Tree, the eternal constant is expounded:\nThe six realms of sentient beings share a single light.\nWhen you grasp the affairs before and after *Vairocana’s* voice,\nYou see there is fundamentally no coming or going—your form is majestic.\n\nInscribed by Zhang Sanfeng, remnant elder of the Great Yuan, on the Day of Balanced Harmony in the *jiazi* year of the Hongwu reign (1484), at the thatched hut on Mount Wudang’s Heavenly Pillar Peak.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\n\"The Rootless Tree\" is the title of these lyrics.\nAll trees have roots to grow and flourish;\nWithout roots, they cannot endure.\nHuman life in the world—birth, aging, sickness, death—\nappears and vanishes in an instant.\nA hundred years pass like a spark or lightning flash,\njust like a tree without roots.\nThe Immortal’s twenty-four lyrics, named after the \"Rootless Tree,\"\nawaken worldly people to see through the illusory dream of floating life\nand cultivate nature and destiny early.\n\n[Li’s Annotation]\n\"The Rootless Tree\" refers to the *qi* of the human body.\nThe hundred meridians of the body all arise from *qi*,\nand *qi* emerges from the realm of emptiness—hence \"rootless.\"\nThe alchemists cultivate roots within the realm of emptiness;\nboth precelestial and postcelestial *qi* arise from nothingness.\nThus, the rootless is the origin of the rooted.\nThose refining postcelestial *qi* must enter emptiness to seek being,\nthen merge being into emptiness.\nThose refining precelestial *qi* must merge being into emptiness,\nthen return from emptiness to being—\nthe cultivation of roots follows this pattern alone.\nYet the *qi* of the human body differs in youth, prime, and old age,\nand the *qi* of refinement varies in its early, middle, and late stages.\nThe twenty-four chapters correspond to the solar terms of a year,\nall urging people to observe the blossoms beneath the Rootless Tree in due season.\nThis is the perfection of the Dao’s sentiment.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Note] Lamenting the world.\n[Li’s Note] Exhorting people to nurture the hidden blossom.\n\nThe Rootless Tree, its blossoms deep in seclusion—\nWho would cease their craving for glory and splendor?\nFloating life’s affairs are a boat on the sea of suffering,\nTossed to and fro without freedom.\nNo shore, no boundary—hard to moor,\nEver drifting in the perilous haunts of fish and dragons.\nIf you would turn your head, there lies the shore;\nDo not wait until the storm wrecks your boat.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nBlossoms are the radiant spirit of a tree.\nThe human body is like a tree,\nand the true numen is like the tree’s blossoms.\nAll trees have roots, so they can grow and bloom.\nOnly the human body is rootless—life and death are uncertain,\nentirely dependent on the movement of a single spark of true numinous *qi*.\nWhen the true numen flourishes, the body lives;\nwhen it declines, the body dies.\nHuman existence and demise hinge on the flourishing or decline of the true numen.\nThus, though the true numen is the blossom of the human tree,\nit is in truth the root of the human tree.\nWang Chongyang called this true numen the \"Yellow Sprout,\"\nLaozi called it the \"Golden Blossom,\"\nLü Dongbin called it the \"Numinous Root,\"\nZhang Boduan called it \"True Gold,\"\nShao Yong called it the \"Heavenly Root,\"\nthe Immortal called it \"Golden Essence,\"\nand various alchemical classics call it the \"Primordial Unity of *Qi*.\"\nThough its names are manifold, they all describe this one thing.\nThis thing is born of the precelestial, stored in the postcelestial,\ngoverning Heaven and Earth, unifying yin and yang,\ndirecting the Five Phases, nurturing the myriad beings.\nVast beyond measure, minute beyond limit,\nwhen released, it fills the Six Directions;\nwhen gathered, it retreats into secrecy.\nIn essence, for Confucians it is the Supreme Ultimate,\nfor Daoists, the Golden Elixir,\nfor Buddhists, Perfect Enlightenment.\nIn function, for Confucians it is Illustrious Virtue or the Heart-Mind of Heaven and Earth,\nfor Daoists, the Numinous Treasure or the Mysterious Pearl of Millet,\nfor Buddhists, the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye or the Wondrous Heart of Nirvana.\nThe true numen of humans is originally round and luminous,\npure and bare, untainted and free,\nneither born nor extinguished, neither form nor emptiness.\nIt neither increases in sages nor decreases in commoners.\nYet, entangled with the postcelestial,\nthe multitude loses it, while the noble preserves it—\nthus the division between sage and commoner.\nThe multitude loses it by chasing false numina,\nwhile the noble preserves it by not pursuing false numina.\nBecause the multitude chases false numina,\nthe true numen becomes dim and obscure.\nFollowing their desires, they crave glory and splendor,\ncompete for fame and profit, never ceasing.\nMistaking the false for the true,\na hundred worries afflict their hearts,\nten thousand affairs weary their forms—\nlike a boat on the sea of suffering,\ntossed to and fro, drifting in the perilous haunts of fish and dragons.\nIf one could suddenly awaken and turn back,\nleaping to the other shore,\none would not wait for the storm to wreck the boat\nand lose one’s nature and life.\nTo lose the human form once is to be trapped for ten thousand kalpas.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nThe mountain recluse has dwelt for years beneath the \"Rootless Tree,\" ever wishing to expound its profound mysteries and summon those of like kind. One day, strolling through the mountain garden, he saw the flowers and trees in their serene seclusion, naturally abundant in grace, and there he grasped that this word \"secluded\" was the wellspring from which the twenty-fourth chapter’s \"Rootless Tree\" unfolds. Secluded—profound, the realm of emptiness and nothingness. All such realms of emptiness in the world are the altars of flowers and trees where Daoists practice. Thus did my mountain teacher inscribe upon the Bamboo-Embracing Study: *\"Three paths of secluded blossoms, fragrance at ease; / Four gardens of cultivated bamboo, shadows intertwined.\"* How wondrous the words! They resonate with this same truth. If flowers are not deeply secluded, their fragrance cannot be at ease; amidst the red dust of the world, peace is elusive day and night.\n\nAs for *\"shadows intertwined\"*—this is the hollow heart and tranquil qi depending upon each other, so that one’s qi nourishes the heart, and the heart nourishes the qi. When qi flourishes, principle is full; when the heart is at peace, the spirit is whole. Thus may one preserve one’s true nature and contain one’s numen. Master Wu Yuan was right to take *\"true numen\"* as the flower and root of the human tree. True numen is true knowing and numinous knowing. Numinous knowing belongs to the nature, which is yin; true knowing belongs to the emotions, which is yang. If nature and emotions remain uncorrupted, the true numen is complete. Yet alas! The seven emotions and six desires consume and deplete it, inwardly damaging the nature and outwardly harming the emotions, so that the true numen vanishes. When the true numen vanishes, there is a tree without flowers, a tree without roots.\n\nMaster Wu Yuan’s meaning is thus. I have more to say: flowers grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, the root grows from nothingness. The essence of the true numen is indeed conceived within emptiness, hence the phrase *\"the flower is truly secluded.\"* That which is conceived within emptiness is the primordial wisdom of the human being, the emptiness and numen within. Without shadow or form, it embodies all principles and responds to all affairs. Sages and worthies employ it with abundance; immortals and buddhas cultivate it to sufficiency. Yet it must not be entangled with emotions and desires. If emotions and desires intrude, one daily extracts being from non-being to meet one’s needs. The more one extracts being, the more one loses non-being; the more one loses non-being, the more one loses the root. Lose the root, and the tree is lost; lose the tree, and the flower is lost. As the saying goes: *\"When a man grows old, his mind wanders east; when a tree grows old, its heart is hollow.\"* Wisdom is exhausted, emptiness and numen scatter—what true numen remains?\n\nAll this comes from craving glory and splendor, refusing to rest, daily pursuing the affairs of floating life, never considering how a hundred years pass in an instant, how death severs all concerns. One sits in the boat of the sea of suffering, yet never thinks that in a single moment of impermanence, the nature may sink with the overturned boat—boundless, shore-less, mooring nowhere, drifting and wandering through the perilous haunts of fish and dragons, endlessly toiling, ceaselessly laboring, only to wound one’s wisdom and fetter one’s emptiness and numen. What benefit is there in this?\n\nThe immortal master, moved by profound compassion, turns the compassionate vessel to ferry them, saying: The reason worldly people sink deeply into the sea of suffering and struggle to escape is that they refuse to turn back and do not recognize the shore. If they would but turn back, that is the shore. The shore is the path of awakening. If one can tread the path of awakening, wisdom returns, emptiness and numen endure. Past errors may yet be corrected; future rightness may still be pursued. Though spirit and qi decline, there is a way to restore them. Only do not wait until the storm’s surging waves shatter the boat. Then, if the boat remains, the person remains—ready for the needs of the other shore, an aid to emerging from the abyss.\n\n[Liu’s Words]\nStrive, diligent seekers.\n\n[Li’s Words]\nExhort others to graft and renew.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms faint,\nAn aged trunk must sprout fresh shoots anew.\nPlum on willow, mulberry on pear—\nSuch patterns passed to those who cultivate the true.\nSince ancient times, immortals’ art of grafting stands:\nEven the old may yet be cured by healing hands.\nSeek a wise teacher, ask the way,\nBegin at once—yet still the hour is late to start the Way.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nMany doubt that age and feeble strength, with spirit spent,\nAre like a tree whose flowers fade, its vital force undone,\nNever to return to primal source, nor root reclaim,\nAnd so they cast themselves away, awaiting death alone.\nYet mark how aged trees, grafted with tender shoots,\nBurgeon anew in lush array—\nPlum on willow, mulberry on pear,\nAll lifeless things, yet life restored.\nHow much more man, most numinous of beings,\nEndowed with heaven and earth’s true qi,\nCould age not also find its cure?\nWhat is this healing art?\nIt is the Way of grafting age anew.\nTo know this Way, seek out a wise teacher,\nBeg the true method without delay.\nOnce found, begin at once—yet still the hour is late.\n\n[Li’s Exegesis]\nFaint means decline.\nWhen one grows old, the primal qi wanes,\nAnd grafting must be hastened then.\nObserve the plum on willow, mulberry on pear—\nThere lies the model.\n*To lodge* is as in the elixir method:\nLodging in the Gate of Dui, or the Western Neighbor’s abode;\n*To graft* is as in the elixir method:\nJoining life to nature, self to other.\nThus plum on willow, mulberry on pear\nAre patterns for today’s true cultivators,\nAncient immortals’ grafting Way.\nGrafting is the cure for age.\nThough grafting trees has proven arts,\nPlum and willow, mulberry and pear are kindred kinds.\nThe old branch split, the tender shoot inserted,\nBound and wrapped, good soil applied,\nYin and yang conjoined—\nSuch is the tree-grafting art.\nThe cure for age must likewise match kind with kind,\nRefined soil fused, then youth and primal source restored.\nThis method wise teachers know;\nIt rests with seekers to inquire.\n“Begin at once—yet still the hour is late”:\nLest time outrun us, impermanence arrive unlooked-for,\nNature unenlightened, life unsecured,\nAnd one stray into the boundless ghostly realm.\nImmortal He Xiangu said:\n“In the Gardens of Lang,\nPeach trees bear willow branches;\nOn Fusang’s boughs, pears entwine—\nThese are the Eastern King and Queen Mother’s\nPointers to the immortal’s Way.”\nZhang Sanfeng’s words are not without foundation.\n\n[Liu’s Words] On the work of refining the self.\n[Li’s Words] On the subtleties of the flower and willow.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms pure and green,\nFrom ancient days to now, flower-wine makes immortals.\nThe brothel’s haze, the meat-and-wine grove:\nNo need to shun flesh’s scent, nor stray into lust.\nLust wastes the treasure of long life;\nMeat and wine pass through the gut—yet the Dao abides in the heart.\nOpen the gate, I tell you this:\nWithout flower, without wine, the Dao cannot be achieved.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nThe Way of the Golden Elixir takes utter purity—without the slightest dross—as its goal. Yet to attain such purity, one must first pass through the realm of utter turbidity. Only by remaining unstained amid the deepest filth does true purity arise. Thus it is said: “The rootless tree—its blossoms pure and green; from ancient days to now, flower-wine makes immortals.”\n\nHow can flower and wine give rise to immortals? The brothel’s haze and the meat-and-wine grove are deft at ensnaring mortals. Yet if one can walk through the brothel seeing color as no-color, untempted by its haze; if one can dwell in the meat-and-wine grove, taking each day as it comes, unburdened by its fare—then one neither strays into lust nor shuns flesh’s scent. Appetite and desire are both transformed, the heart of the Dao abides, the human heart fades, and the true spirit remains unharmed, undiminished. The Way may then be hoped for.\n\nThe phrase “no need to shun flesh’s scent” does not mean craving it, but rather that meat and wine pass through the gut while the heart makes no reckoning. Unstained by lust, the heart is free of the brothel’s haze; meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the heart knows no meat or wine. A heart free of the brothel’s haze naturally bears the immortal’s blossom of long life; a heart free of meat and wine naturally holds the immortal’s wine of life’s extension. With immortal blossom and immortal wine, one arrives at the realm of pure truth. Those in the world who shun the brothel’s haze and avoid meat and wine—how could they know that immortals emerge from the midst of mortal blossoms and mortal wine? How could they know that without blossom, without wine, the Dao cannot be achieved?\n\nThe *Knocking on the Hexagrams Song* says:\n“Wine is a good friend, blossoms a companion;\nIn the willow lanes and flower streets, seek the true person.\nThe true person is found only in the flower streets’ play.”\nThis is the subtle use of “blossoms pure and green.”\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nFor most people, the nature of appetite and desire is strongest. Master Immortal Zhang Sanfeng thus used flower and wine as pointers. Many crave flower and wine—yet who knows of the flower-wine immortals? The primordial qi within the body is fresh, verdant, and tender. If one can consume it, harness it, drink it, and wear it, one’s spirit becomes clear and qi invigorated. This is what is meant by “flower-wine immortals,” who have existed from ancient times to the present. Yet these are not the brothel’s haze or the meat-and-wine grove of the world.\n\nThe haze of brothels and the fare of meat and wine dull the spirit. The qi of meat and wine is rank, and the haze of brothels stirs lust—both are harmful, though lust is the graver. Those skilled in refining the self eat when food is at hand, without seeking more. Thus they do not shun flesh’s scent, yet forget it; they see color as no-color, without clinging to beauty. Thus they do not stray into lust, and lust is extinguished. Otherwise, essence scatters and fluids leak, causing no small harm. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: “Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy; only by sealing and guarding the light can one attain lasting peace.” From this we know that straying into lust must waste the treasure of long life.\n\nMeat and wine pass through the gut—yet the Dao still abides in the heart. How could flower and wine delude one? It is people who delude themselves with flower and wine! Without seeking mortal blossoms or mortal wine, one must find the immortal blossom and immortal wine. Immortal blossom and immortal wine aid the achievement of the Dao—they are the fresh, tender blossoms on the rootless tree, rich in flavor and fine in hue, most potent for nourishment.\n\nThe immortal master opens the primordial gate and tells you this: without such blossoms and wine, the Dao is difficult to achieve.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Words] Refuting heterodox paths.\n[Li’s Words] Lamenting solitary cultivation.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms solitary.\nMay I ask: have you found the matching yin and yang?\nA hen’s egg—hard to hatch a chick,\nFor it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin and yang.\nA woman without a husband is a resentful maiden;\nA man without a wife is a widowed man.\nI sigh for the deluded,\nSo muddled—\nSitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nThe Way of cultivating truth requires the matching of yin and yang to fully form the treasure of the true spirit. If there is yin without yang, or yang without yin, this is called “solitary blossoms without match,” and the true spirit cannot be formed—just like a hen’s egg. It is hard to hatch a chick because it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin-yang union.\n\nAgain, like a woman without a husband or a man without a wife—how can they bear offspring? Those blind fools in the world, not delving into the principles of yin and yang, not tracing the source of creation, muddled in their affairs: some contemplate emptiness, some regulate breath, some fixate on spirits, some guard the apertures, some move qi—all are sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, yin without yang. Not only do they fail to benefit their nature and life, but they harm them, and the more they cultivate, the more their qi withers.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n“Solitary” refers to inner cultivation. Cultivating nature alone cannot establish life, for it is solitary and without counterpart, unable to give birth to the treasure of life. It is like a hen without a rooster—though it can lay eggs, it cannot hatch chicks. Today, those who cultivate nature to nurture qi do not realize that their qi is merely solitary yin. To avoid withering, true yang must be matched with true yin—only then are they of the same kind.\n\nMay I ask those who cultivate the Dao: have you obtained the matching kind? Here, true yang is righteousness, and true yin is the Dao. Matching righteousness with the Dao, one is no longer solitary. Yet there are three layers to this process: first, true yin gives rise to true yang; next, true yang is matched with true yin; finally, from the union of yin and yang, the vast qi of the true spirit is born. How could this be like a hen’s egg, hard to hatch a chick?\n\nThose that cannot hatch chicks do so because they have abandoned the principle of yin and yang and the furnace of creation. Yin and yang are husband and wife. The Dao of the sage begins with husband and wife, and from them all things are transformed and born—so too is it with the men and women of the world. If a woman has no husband, she is solitary yin that cannot give birth and becomes a resentful maiden; if a man has no wife, he is solitary yang that cannot be nurtured and becomes a widowed bachelor. This principle is clear and easy to understand, yet the deluded of the world remain utterly confused, believing that sitting in stillness alone can clarify the mind, reveal the nature, and allow one to ascend directly—all without ever speaking of the matching of yin and yang. I fear that day after day of sitting and cultivating will only lead one to wander the halls of empty nothingness or play in the sea of extinction, until eventually their qi withers and fades.\n\n*[Liu’s verse:]*\nMatching yin and yang.\n*[Li’s verse:]*\nInverting yin and yang.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms askew—\nseparated from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.\nGold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead,\nyang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.\nIn the world, yin and yang—man pairs with woman—\nbear sons and grandsons, generation after generation.\nFollowing the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—\nthe difference lies solely in this inversion.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe *Book of Changes* states: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” *Awakening to Reality* says: “When yin and yang are of the same kind, they return to mutual resonance; when the two eights are balanced, they naturally unite.” If yin and yang are each askew—if yang stirs but yin does not respond, if yin seeks but yang does not beckon, if yang is excessive while yin is deficient, or if yang is abundant while yin is lacking—then the blossom of true spirit is askew, neither centered nor upright, and the Dao cannot be complete.\n\nA person’s true emotion is like gold, true knowing like lead—both are firm. The numinous nature is like wood, the numinous knowing like mercury—both are soft. True emotion and true knowing, being firm, easily sink; the numinous nature and numinous knowing, being soft, easily float. If nature seeks emotion, emotion returns to nature; if the true restrains the numinous, the numinous returns to the true—then firm and soft respond to each other, yin and yang harmonize, and they transform into one qi, with life’s mechanism enduring unceasingly. But if emotion does not return to nature, if the numinous does not return to the true—this is what is meant by “gold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead, yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.” How then can one return to the root and restore the origin, coalescing the elixir of true spirit?\n\nObserve the world: when man and woman unite, they bear sons and grandsons, passing life from generation to generation without end. Know then that the Dao of cultivating the true is the same—when yin and yang unite, they give birth to immortals and sages, also passing on without end. The difference lies only in whether one follows the flow or reverses it, distinguishing immortals from mortals. Following the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—the contention lies solely in this inversion.\n\nThis “inversion” is profound in principle and subtle in practice. It is not the center of inside and outside, nor the center of the body’s upper and lower. It is the center of the union of bright yang, formless and imageless, called the root of heaven and earth, the aperture of yin and yang, the abode of life and death, the gate of primordial transformation. Human life resides here, human death resides here; becoming a sage or worthy resides here, becoming human or beast also resides here. If one cultivating the Dao can stand firm in this place, reverse the flow, and invert it, then calamity transforms into fortune, punishment into virtue—what is called “the elixir forming in a single hour.”\n\nAlas! The “inversion” is not easily known, nor is the person who inverts it. The sexual arts take the place of union between man and woman as the “inversion,” with the man absorbing the woman’s blood as the reversal. The circulation arts take the Yellow Court as the “inversion,” with qi and blood rising in the back and descending in the front as the reversal. All these are but crude imitations—how could they understand the meaning of inversion in the path of immortals? Those who seek the truth should discern this carefully.\n\n*[Li’s explanation:]*\n“Askew” refers to yin and yang being separated, unable to complete the elixir. When yin and yang unite at the center, the knife-point of the elixir congeals, and the arts of the Dao are fully realized. Gold and wood, lead and mercury—these are yin and yang. The essence of wood and the nature of mercury belong to yin; the qi of gold and the emotion of lead belong to yang. Essence and qi require each other, nature and emotion resonate—gold cherishes the benevolence of wood, wood loves the righteousness of gold; mercury goes to welcome lead, lead comes to join mercury. Only then is there no illness of separation, and the great medicine of the true body is born. If yin is solitary and yang widowed, each to one side, then yin and yang do not pair, askew and incomplete—how can they transform and give birth to the supreme treasure, passing it down for ten thousand generations?\n\nThe method of matching is similar for immortals and mortals—only mortals use the flow, while immortals use the reversal. Master Wu Yuan said that the “inversion” is not easily known; I say that even the word “reverse” is not understood. To invert at the center, one must first know the wondrous use of “reverse.” If one knows reversal, then gold, wood, lead, and mercury are all within it; yin and yang, qian and kun, are all inverted—and moreover, all events revolve within the word “reverse.” Obtaining the medicine and returning the elixir can be achieved in an instant.\n\n*[Liu’s verse:]*\nWhen the medicine is born.\n*[Li’s verse:]*\nThe principle of *kun* and *shen*.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms fresh—\nborn in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.\nPluck the blossom, wear it;\ngather the blossom’s heart,\nits pistils layered in spring’s splendor.\nPeople of the world do not grasp the principle within the blossom—\na single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\nBorrow the blossom’s name, become the blossom’s body—\nevery line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\n“Fresh” means that the original thing, long buried, suddenly reappears. When the blossom is fresh, its radiance is reborn—like the moon appearing in the southwest *kun* direction, beneath pure yin, where a speck of subtle yang emerges. This is like the empty room generating brightness, the true spirit manifesting, and the original face reappearing.\n\nThis original face is none other than the undying true person within me—with this person, one is human; without it, one is not. It is what I receive from heaven to be human. Yet this true person does not readily appear, nor is it often seen. Only in moments of utter emptiness and profound stillness, when all conditions are stilled, does its image fleetingly emerge. Utter emptiness and profound stillness are the very image of *kun* in its pure yin—hence it is said, “born in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.”\n\nThis person has long been buried beneath dust and grime, leaving no trace. When its image suddenly appears, it is like a fresh blossom—an opportunity not to be missed. One must act swiftly, plucking and gathering it to make it one’s own. To “pluck the blossom and wear it” is to take up this true person’s flower; to “gather the blossom’s heart” is to gather this true person’s heart. Gradually plucking and gathering, from little to much, one accumulates depth and radiance, and the true spirit remains undimmed. Then the pistils layer upon layer, all principles become luminous, and wherever the heart turns, the Way is present—its splendor as bright as spring, with yang qi spreading everywhere and blossoms blooming in every place.\n\nYet this flower belongs to everyone; everyone sees it, yet no one grasps it. Most let it slip past them, face to face. If one does grasp it, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood occurs in an instant—hence it is said, “a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.” The immortal elder, out of compassion, borrows the blossom’s name to become the blossom’s body—now form, now formless—each line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* expounding the intent of the primordial, wishing for all to attain the Dao and each to become an immortal. Alas, how can those of this age not grasp the principle within the blossom, and instead recklessly speculate with “bedchamber arts” and “inner elixirs of the boudoir”? Even the immortal elder can do nothing about it. How lamentable!\n\n*[Li’s commentary:]*\nMaster Wuyuan speaks of the character “person” as the original face—one who has glimpsed this person cannot help but speak at length and with deep feeling, seeking to awaken both self and others with earnest compassion. Yet the word “is” in “kun *is* the person” has not been fully illuminated.\n\nNow, the blossom is likened to the person, and the person borrows the blossom as a metaphor. The blossom being fresh is like a person returning to the root, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, observing the return of that single yang—unaware, the spring scenery is renewed. This blossom appears in the *kun* direction, meaning *kun* sees the blossom, the blossom sees the person, and where the blossom is born is where the person is born—hence “kun *is* the person.”\n\nIn the alchemical method, lead is sown in the metal village, mercury is scattered in the fire land. Metal and fire reside in the southwest; the southwest gains its companion. Where metal and fire unite is precisely above the *kun* direction. This person is a golden body and fiery form, a realm of pure yang—our true qi, also called true emotion. Vague and indistinct, within it there is an image: hot as fire, radiant as a blossom. Its fragrance intoxicates like wine, and to obtain it is to be as if drunk. At this moment, one must pluck and wear it without delay. One must further gather its heart, swallowing it whole. From blossom to pistil, penetrating layer upon layer, it is truly the splendor of spring’s palace. Yet people know only its exterior and not its interior, and thus cannot grasp the wondrous principle within the blossom.\n\nThe wondrous principle within the blossom is pure heaven’s mechanism. When heaven’s mechanism is revealed, a single secret is worth ten thousand gold. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lines here are all from Lü Zu’s *Knocking on the Trigrams*. Master Feng said: “Lü Zu borrows the blossom’s name for the human body and takes the blossom’s body as the human’s body. My lines, each drawn from *Knocking on the Trigrams*, speak with utmost truth and savor.”\n\n[Liu’s words] Seize the moment to pluck and gather.\n[Li’s words] Before the furnace, settle into stillness.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms now in full bloom,\nFair and delicate, their beauty rivals powdered jade.\nGuard against the ape and horse, stubborn and wild;\nDon the iron mask of your natal face.\nRaise the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon,\nPluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall.\nWith wind-filled sails, return fully laden—\nHow could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain?\n\n[Liu’s commentary] When the primordial true spirit shines forth, one root gives rise to ten thousand branches. In every moment, contemplate its images—nothing exists apart from the blossoms in their abundance. At the height of their bloom, when radiance is fully revealed and spirit expends itself outwardly, one is prone to vie for marvels and flaunt refinement. Thus it is said: “Fair and delicate, their beauty rivals powdered jade.” At this very moment, one must guard against peril and danger, firmly tether the ape and horse, don the iron mask of one’s natal face, and wield the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon. In the presence of phenomena, forget emotion; pluck every blossom that emerges from the wall, allowing not the slightest attachment to form or dissipation of true qi. The “natal face” is the iron mask of unknowing and unawareness. The “treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon” is the true nature untouched by defilement. The natal iron mask and the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword arise from the same source but bear different names: in terms of essence, it is the natal iron mask; in terms of function, it is the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword. The iron mask is the settled body; the treasure-sword is the instrument of wisdom. Stillness employs wisdom; wisdom perfects stillness. Stillness and wisdom depend on each other; essence and function are never apart. The primordial true spirit is form yet emptiness, ever responsive yet ever still, without leakage or seepage—this is what is meant by “plucking every fresh blossom from the garden wall.” The blossoms on the wall have just emerged but have not yet left the wall, the moment when true qi has not yet dispersed. Pluck them at this instant, and they are utterly free of dross, purely celestial truth. Gradually grow, gradually gather; gradually pluck, gradually withdraw—one must pluck until nothing remains to be plucked. Alas! The great medicine is hard to encounter; the great method is hard to meet. Having chanced upon them, the moment must not be missed. With wind-filled sails, swiftly pluck the fresh blossoms, return fully laden—how could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain, only to regret it later?\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n\"Abundance\" refers to the moment of fullness. The beauty of a fair face and delicate features is likened to the primordial unity of qi—just as the Immortal Elder’s *Five Watches Daoist Ballad* says: *\"When all yin is spent, the radiant yang season arrives, / A branch of spring’s splendor, golden blossoms in bloom.\"* \"Surpassing the powdered mass\" describes the birth of the medicine, the very instant when the flower-demon vies in beauty. As the ancient immortals said: *\"When the primordial arises, the demon of medicine readily stirs.\"* If one’s cultivation is not yet pure and unwavering in the face of beauty, who could seize the golden blossom in but half a moment? Thus it is said: *\"Guard against the ape and horse, ever more stubborn\"*—just as the *One Branch of Flowers* ballad puts it: *\"With delicate, alluring grace, / Ten slender fingers, soft and fair, / Yet they stir not my intent-steed or mind-ape.\"*\n\nRaise the iron mask of your birth-given face, bring forth your power of stillness—*\"Let them try, yet not a trace of wavering remains.\"* Draw the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon, pluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall—this aligns with *\"Repel the demon horde, fiercely wield the keen-edged sword of wisdom, / Dare to gather those blossoms newly sprung beyond the wall.\"* Wu Yuan takes the iron mask as stillness and the treasure-sword as wisdom, truly a kindred understanding. Yet if stillness and wisdom do not arise from the refinement of the self, then stillness is not true stillness, nor wisdom true wisdom—they cannot be employed when the moment arrives.\n\nThe *One Branch of Flowers* says: *\"Moment by moment, guard the intent-steed, / Instant by instant, lock the mind-ape, / Day and night without rest, / Refine the self with unbroken effort.\"* One must cultivate until *\"I am a sea of purity, unstained by a single speck of dust\"*—only then is it true stillness. *\"I am a night-shining pearl, suspended in the void\"*—only then is it true wisdom.\n\nThe \"garden wall\" signifies the blossom that has emerged beyond the wall yet still clings to it—this is called the \"blossom beyond the wall.\" The fire is at its purest, the timing at its truest; without a transmitted teaching, none can comprehend it, and without having traversed the path, none can know it. If one recognizes the moment the flower’s branch emerges beyond the wall and immediately gathers it, this is the immortal’s art. \"Plucking every blossom\" means drawing it all in with a single breath, swallowing it into one’s own domain—not the gradual gathering and gradual withdrawal. Gradual gathering and withdrawal belong to the later stages of nurturing, drawing out, and replenishing.\n\nSeize the wind-filled sails, return fully laden—when the four signs converge, the elixir is formed, and the River Chariot is swiftly set in motion to carry it back. How could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain? This mountain of treasures is the birthplace of the primordial.\n\nIn the alchemical method, what is refined is called medicine, what is gathered is called medicine, and what is nurtured is called fire. Yet where there is medicine, there is fire—though not the fire of gentle nurturing. This chapter’s annotation correctly interprets the gathering of medicine.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Note] Advancing and retreating yin and yang.\n[Li’s Note] Nurturing the returned elixir.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms in flight,\nOnce shed, they bloom again at the appointed time.\nWhen the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent,\nOnce more the western garden’s branches burst with bloom.\nJust gathered beneath the moon’s waning light,\nAgain they mend the robe in morning’s glow.\nThis mystery, rare in the world,\nMust be pondered deeply with the immortals.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nWhen a person’s spirit declines and true numen scatters, it is like blossoms flying and withering away. Yet even fallen blossoms have their season of rebirth; so too does the decline of a person hold the way of return. What is this way of return? It is the path of yin yielding to yang once more, the way of withered blossoms blooming anew.\n\nThe \"lead-flower\" is the radiance of the Dao-heart’s true knowing. *Gui*-water is the selfish desire of the human heart’s guest qi. When the lead-flower appears, the Dao-heart remains undimmed; when *gui*-water is exhausted, the human heart abides in stillness. With the Dao-heart undimmed and the human heart still, the original, unblemished, and perfectly complete true numen reappears—thus the blossoms, though fallen, bloom again in full.\n\nBecause *gui*-water must be spent, it is said: *\"Gathered beneath the moon’s waning light.\"* Because the lead-flower must appear, it is said: *\"Mend the robe in morning’s glow.\"* The selfish desires of the human heart are like the guest qi from without, like the moon’s waning light. The true knowing of the Dao-heart is the original, upright qi, like the sun’s radiance. Gathering beneath the moon’s waning light sweeps away the selfish desires of the human heart—this is the retreat of yin. Mending the robe in morning’s glow gradually replenishes the true knowing of the Dao-heart—this is the advance of yang.\n\nRetreat yin until not a trace of yin qi remains—only then is the waning light fully gathered. Advance yang until yang qi is utterly pure—only then is the robe fully mended. With yin spent and yang complete, one returns to the origin and reverts to the root; the original face is fully revealed. Is not the rebirth of fallen blossoms a true saying? This celestial mechanism of withered blossoms blooming anew is rarely known in the world. To know it, one must ponder its beginning and end alongside the immortals.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nWu Yuan’s annotation is excellent in principle, yet it does not address the core meaning of this chapter. Here, the discussion pertains to the nurturing of the returned elixir. \"Flight\" refers to ascent and descent, signifying the morning advance of yang fire and the evening retreat of yin tally. \"Shedding\" means the elixir has taken form, leaves have fallen to return to the root—this directly points to the restoration of life.\n\nAfter life is restored, one draws upon the external furnace’s metal-water, extracts lead, and replenishes mercury to nurture the spiritual embryo. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The external furnace’s increase and decrease require effort.\"* The *Triple Concordance* states: *\"Observe and tend with utmost care, / Examine and adjust cold and warmth, / Cycle through the twelve nodes, / And when each ends, begin anew.\"* Elder Feng said: *\"At midnight and noon, focus the fire’s timing; / At dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir in ice.\"* Thus it is said: *\"Once shed, they bloom again at the appointed time.\"*\n\nThe \"reblooming\" refers to the branches of blossoms in the western garden below. \"When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent\" means the great medicine of the returned elixir arises after *gui*. When lead is born, it is gathered. Gold, when far from its fullness, is unfit for tasting. Only after the initial surge of *gui*-water on the five thousand forty-eighth day does one carefully apply effort, seize the foremost treasure of the first tide—this is the supreme method.\n\nWhen *gui* arises, it is the fourteenth; when *gui* is spent, it is the fifteenth—at this very moment, a single ray of yang light appears. In the human body, this is nothing other than the great movement within the great stillness. Gather and swallow it, and the returned elixir is formed. Yet once the great elixir is obtained, external lead arises anew, and the alchemist must take it for the purpose of gentle nurturing. Thus it is said: *\"Once more, the western garden’s branches bloom full with flowers.\"*\n\nJust as one faces the moon to gather and put away—this is the drawing of lead—so too does one turn toward the morning sun to mend the patched robe—this is the replenishing of mercury. The method of gathering requires clarity on the moon’s waxing and waning, hence the reference to \"facing the moon\"; the method of mending demands the use of the sun’s dawn and dusk, hence the metaphor of the \"morning sun.\" Such are the subtle truths of the mysterious arts. These profound subtleties are rarely known in the world. Should one wish to understand them, one must seek them through careful inquiry with a realized immortal—only then may one avoid error.\n\n**[Liu’s Verse]**\nThe Moon-Couch Furnace.\n**[Li’s Verse]**\nThe Heavenly Treasure.\n\nThe rootless tree blooms in full,\nPlucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace.\nProlonging life, dispelling calamity,\nBest to forge good bonds and prepare the dharma-wealth.\nFrom this, the Heavenly Treasure may be achieved—\nLet the deluded masses mock my folly.\n\nUrge the worthy to abandon cunning,\nWithout a wise teacher, do not force guesses.\n\n**[Liu’s Annotation]**\nThe treasure of primordial true spirit is formless and imageless, without direction or place—from where, then, is it gathered to congeal the returned elixir? Though formless and imageless, without direction or place, it too has its time of blooming. When that time arrives, within the indistinct there is form; within the profound darkness, there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it lies constancy. Its symbolic form resembles the Moon-Couch. Common practitioners, unaware of the ancients’ intent in taking this image, misidentify it as the space between the kidneys, or the bright hall between the brows, or the stubborn fleshly heart. Even worse are the demonic fabrications that point to a woman’s birth passage—gross errors, all!\n\nWhat is meant by the \"Moon-Couch\"? It is the moon in its reclining aspect. Each month, on the third day, beneath the dark body of the southwest *kun* earth, the crescent’s light emerges, its glow reclining—hence the name \"Moon-Couch.\" In the hexagrams, this is the faint yang beginning to arise beneath pure yin, the *Fu* hexagram. In the human being, it is the movement after extreme stillness, the birth of brightness in an empty chamber, the stirring of the heart of Heaven and Earth. Within this heart lies a single point of primordial ancestral *qi*, faintly revealing its signs from the depths of darkness, resembling the reclining light of the moon. Because this single point of ancestral *qi* is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of the Five Phases, it can create immortals and buddhas, forge sages and worthies, and secure both nature and life—thus it is also called the Moon-Couch Furnace.\n\nThis heart of Heaven and Earth aligns its virtue with Heaven and Earth, its brightness with the sun and moon, its order with the four seasons, and its auspices with spirits and gods—rarely encountered, difficult to meet. Should one chance upon it, the moment must not be missed. One must swiftly reach out to pluck it, seal it securely, and guard against leakage. Thus may life be prolonged and calamities dispelled. Yet such matters of prolonging life and dispelling calamity cannot be undertaken by those without great merit and conduct, nor accomplished by those lacking great resolve and strength. One must externally cultivate good affinities to refine virtue, and internally prepare dharma-wealth with sincerity—only then can one move the Imperial Ultimate and obtain the Heavenly Treasure.\n\nDharma-wealth is not worldly wealth, but the wealth within the dharma: single-minded devotion, true practice, and unwavering resolve—this is the good wealth. As the Perfected One of Upper Yang said: *\"If Heaven resists, one must seek it with dharma-wealth and utmost sincerity. For to seek the Heavenly Treasure, one must exhaust human effort. If human effort is not exhausted, there is no dharma-wealth. Without dharma-wealth, to vainly desire the Heavenly Treasure is difficult indeed.\"* How can one seeking the Heavenly Treasure fail to first prepare dharma-wealth?\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure is no other thing than the golden elixir refined from true spirit, the returned elixir restored to the heart of Heaven and Earth. \"True spirit\" and \"heart of Heaven and Earth\" refer to it before refinement; \"Heavenly Treasure\" and \"golden elixir\" refer to it after refinement and maturation. Once the Heavenly Treasure is obtained, the ten thousand things are all empty, the roots and dust are transformed, and one enters the state of unknowing, without self or others—let the deluded masses mock my folly.\n\nThis folly must be transmitted orally by a wise teacher, heart to heart—it cannot be known through forced guesses. As the Immortal Elder said: *\"Urge the worthy to abandon cunning; without a wise teacher, do not force guesses.\"* How greatly he warns later generations!\n\n**[Li’s Explanation]**\n\"Blooms\" refers to the jade bud’s first arising. The Moon-Couch Furnace has no fixed location in the human body, nor a fixed time, for it appears when yang *qi* first stirs, light within stillness—thus it is compared to the new moon born from extreme darkness. This moon in the sky has its *geng* direction and its third day, both with specific times and places. But in the human body, where it appears is the *geng* direction, and when it appears is the third day—it cannot be predetermined.\n\nWhat is the shape of the Moon-Couch? It is as depicted in Liu’s diagram: reclining, with nine parts black and one part white, the white seen within the black, yang *qi* first arising—thus the white light appears above as the Moon-Couch. What people today describe has this shape, but it is the *upright* moon, not the *reclining* moon.\n\nWhy speak of \"plucking it down\"? Because its *qi* is in the void. When the alchemist sees this thread of white light, one must not rashly activate the river chariot. One should only, with a tranquil spirit and harmonious intent, gather it from where the *qi* arises—hence the phrase *\"plucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace.\"* When spirit and *qi* unite, suddenly the yang light shines fully, like the full circle of the fifteenth day ○—this is the mid-autumn moon, the tide of *qi* at its peak. Only then does one drive it along the Yellow Path and send it to the Yellow Court. From this, life may be prolonged and calamities dispelled.\n\nTrue companions of the Dharma and wealth are those of like mind who cherish the Dao, willingly offer their good fortune, protect the Dharma for others, and assist in their attainment of the Way. In *Discernments on Cultivating the Real*, Wu Yuan’s commentary on this chapter likewise interprets \"Dharma-wealth\" as something within the body—this is merely a corrective against greed. Speaking impartially, Dharma-wealth has two aspects: the inner Dharma-wealth, which is true gold, and the outer Dharma-wealth, which is a provisional treasure. Though borrowing the provisional to refine the true is indispensable, one should not covet it excessively.\n\nWhen the celestial treasure is refined, one may feign foolishness and play the fool, holding jade within and embracing the uncarved block. Though the deluded masses may mock me as a simpleton, all such matters may be dismissed without concern. Yet how easily can one speak of refining the celestial treasure! Without encountering an enlightened teacher, one cannot know its secrets.\n\n**Liu’s Verse:**\nThe Reverted Elixir ripens.\n\n**Li’s Verse:**\nThe Reverted Elixir enters the mountains.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms now full,\nBears fruit, its harvest complete in every flavor.\nLike a crimson tangerine, round as a pellet,\nGuard and defend its embankments—never neglect.\nLearn the method of plants gathering their crowns,\nReturn to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.\n\n**Liu’s Annotation:**\nThe treasure of true numen—what departs returns, what is old becomes new again, unharmed and undiminished, still the original substance—this is the fullness of the blossom. \"Fullness\" here speaks of the fruit’s harvest, its flavors complete. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, the Five Phases cluster together, the Four Images harmonize, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust merge into one principle. Essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent return to a single *qi*. Further refined by the fire of talismans, it becomes a purely yang substance—lively and fluid, crimson as a tangerine, round as a pellet. At this time, one must guard its embankments, never neglecting vigilance in the twelve hours, concealing one’s brilliance and nurturing obscurity. Learn the method of plants gathering their crowns, return to life, revert to the root, and restore the origin, awaiting the stillness that gives rise to movement. Then, uniting with the primordial, one completes the Great Reversion Elixir. This speaks of the work of forging the Great Elixir after the Reverted Elixir is accomplished.\n\nFor the Reverted Elixir merely restores the original substance of one’s own nature—an affair of transcending the mundane. As Lü Zu said: *\"With three leads, only one lead is secured; the golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to take form.\"* The Great Elixir, however, is the upward endeavor pursued after the Reverted Elixir—a matter of entering sagehood. As Lü Zu said: *\"Reinstall the furnace, reset the crucible, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm.\"* If one only refines the Reverted Elixir without forging the Great Elixir, one merely completes the initial vehicle of the Dao, becoming nothing more than a whole person—how could one enter the realm of the sages?\n\nThe \"selecting of a numinous site\" and \"establishing of a Dao hermitage\" do not refer to external places but to the numinous site and Dao hermitage within. When cultivation reaches the point of reverting to the root and restoring life, the work of the Reverted Elixir is complete. Nurturing and warming it, when spirit and *qi* are abundant, the elixir becomes numinous—this is called the Numinous Elixir. From this numinous site, reinstall the furnace and reset the crucible—this is called establishing the Dao hermitage. \"Selecting a numinous site\" means awaiting the arising of the first yang. This first yang is the yang of primordial stillness giving rise to movement, unlike the yang of the Reverted Elixir, which arises from the postnatal to become primordial. Though both are primordial, there is a distinction of before and after. To complete the Great Reversion Elixir, one must unite with the yang within the primordial—without this, success is impossible. Thus it is said: *\"Uniting with the primordial completes the Great Reversion.\"*\n\nOnly when the Great Elixir is accomplished does one lay the foundation of sagehood. If the Great Elixir remains unformed, it is but a halfway endeavor, not the full achievement of cultivation. As the Buddhist scriptures say: *\"One who halts at the hundred-foot pole has entered but not truly arrived. Advance another step at the hundred-foot pole, and the ten directions become one’s entire body.\"* Does this not speak of completing the Great Reversion?\n\n**Li’s Explanation:**\n\"Full\" refers to the Reverted Elixir, signifying the reunion of nature and emotions. Its method lies in attaining emptiness and guarding stillness. Observe the moon’s waxing in the west—it is like the initial stirring of yang *qi*. Immediately mobilize one’s own mercury to meet it, where external contact sparks internal resonance, and internal touch evokes external response, like a magnet drawing iron. Gather it into the cinnabar field—this is the external elixir. The method is exceedingly simple and easy, so the ancient immortals said: *\"It can be accomplished in less than half an hour.\"*\n\nThe Elixir has two grades, which may be divided into three vehicles. The methods of the three vehicles all involve gathering the lead blossom and are all called Reverted Elixirs, differing only in their scale and sequence.\n\nThe first is the initial vehicle, called the Coagulated Elixir or Jade Fluid Reverted Elixir. Within the postnatal, it returns to the primordial, departing from *gui* to take *ren*, nurturing it with jade fluid to round the inner elixir—this is the study of fulfilling one’s nature, the immortal of humanity.\n\nThe second is the superior vehicle, named the Reverted Elixir or Sevenfold Return. Using the primordial returned from the postnatal, it plants the seed of the primordial, establishing the Elixir Mother—this is the study of establishing one’s life, the immortal of earth.\n\nThe third is the great vehicle, called the Ninefold Cyclical Great Reversion Elixir. Its medicine is likened to the full moon of the fifteenth night. Within the primordial, it is primordial; when the fire arrives, it moves, transforming into white fluid. Swallowed into the abdomen, it congeals into something supremely firm—this is the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir, most numinous and wondrous, perfecting sagehood and realizing transcendence. This is the study of uniting nature and life, the immortal of heaven.\n\n\"The blossoms now full\" refers to the foundation of the superior vehicle’s elixir. Having formed one fruit and reaped one harvest, its method of refining lead involves the mutual absorption of two substances, with the Five Phases all complete—this is what is meant by \"flavors complete.\" Though this elixir is not that of the great vehicle, it is nonetheless vividly crimson like a tangerine and perfectly round like a pellet. At this stage, one must silently attend to it, continuously preserving it as if it were always present. Otherwise, if one’s embrace is not intimate, it may easily slip away. Thus, one must guard its embankments and never neglect vigilance.\n\nLearn the method of gathering herbs and bringing cultivation to completion—this is what the *Yi* means by \"therewith wash the heart, storing it in secrecy.\" Returning to life, reverting to the root, and restoring the primordial—this is what the *Cantong Qi* means by \"the true dwelling in whiteness, square and round within an inch.\"\n\nChoose a numinous site and establish a Daoist hermitage. Wu Yuan states that the numinous site and Daoist hermitage reside within the human body, yet they also serve dual functions, inner and outer. For the inner numinous site and hermitage, one must seek clarity and stillness in the spirit terrace, with harmonious qi and spirit, and therein establish the Peaceful Hermitage of the Daoist’s heart. For the outer numinous site and hermitage, one must seek blessed mountains and auspicious lands, free from the disturbance of worldly dust, and therein establish the Thatched Hut of White Clouds for the Daoist. In this way, both the heart and its traces remain pure, true power fills to the brim, yang is born within lead, and through gathering and uniting, the Dao is accomplished in the ninefold great return—thus the sagely work is perfected.\n\n**Liu’s Note:** The qi of true oneness.\n**Li’s Note:** The place of union.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms now flourishing—speaks of the rootless as though it had roots. The three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five: when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins. How clear this is, yet when explained to you, I fear you may meet it and still fail to recognize it truly.\n\n**Liu’s Commentary:** The treasure of the primordial true numinous, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, penetrating all—nowhere obstructed, nowhere not efficacious—this is the flourishing of the blossoms. Since the blossoms flourish, though the tree is rootless, the blossoms nonetheless have roots. What root is this? It is the aperture of the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—and the essence of the wondrous union of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Because it is the aperture of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, it is born prior to heaven and earth yet concealed within them afterward. One qi divides into yin and yang, and yin and yang unite to form one qi. Thus, when heaven and earth’s yin and yang above and below unite, they merge into one qi and the myriad things are born; when the sun and moon’s yin and yang come and go in union, they merge into one qi and cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman’s yin and yang unite with one another, conception begins. Observing heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman—only when one yin and one yang unite is there creation. From this, one may know that the Dao of nature and life cannot be completed without the union of yin and yang into one. This one qi is the root of nature and life, the aperture of life and death. With this aperture, yin and yang unite and life is born; without this qi, yin and yang turn away from one another and death ensues. Human life and death lie solely in the presence or absence of this one qi. Yet people do not know what this qi is or where it resides. Some mistake it for the qi of breath, or circulate it upward and downward in the Yellow Court, or gather it in the cinnabar field, or concentrate it between the brows, or collect it in the Celestial Valley, or amass it behind the brain—endless strange and fantastical notions, all ultimately leading to emptiness and loss. They do not realize that the primordial true oneness qi is invisible, inaudible, and intangible. The sage shapes the real through the empty, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are true yin and true yang; the empty and nonexistent are the qi of the two eights’ waxing and waning. When these two are juxtaposed, one qi resides in the center, congealing into the elixir—this is an endeavor of the empty void. How could it be guessed at through forms and images? How could it be sought in apertures with fixed locations? Since the Immortal Elder saw that people did not recognize this one qi, he pointed to the apertures of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, and further illustrated it through the union of heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman, clearly indicating this one qi to all. Yet he feared that when people encountered this one qi, they might fail to recognize it even when face to face. With boldness and at risk of censure, I, Wu Yuan, shall now vividly convey the Immortal Elder’s meaning for all to hear. Know that the primordial true oneness qi is no other thing—it is the qi of a single point of true numinosity. Because this qi is firm, strong, centered, and upright, it is called true oneness; because it is easy to know and simple in its efficacy, it is called true numinosity. True oneness and true numinosity are utterly without impurity, hence they are called primordial things. True oneness and true numinosity emerge from the same source under different names—they are not two separate things. Does anyone truly recognize this?\n\n**Li’s Explanation:** \"Flourishing\" means unobstructed. The unobstructed qi emerges from the \"union\" in the following text. Blossoms grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, and the root grows from nothingness—thus the rootless has roots. The rootless root is the root that generates heaven, earth, and humanity. This root is a single aperture of emptiness and nothingness, hence it is called the aperture of the three talents. This aperture is the place of essence-union, thus it is said: \"the three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five.\" The two and five: heaven’s five is one five, earth’s ten is another five—thus the two and five are two earths, and when the two earths unite, the knife-point elixir is formed. The *Mud Pill* states: \"The Mysterious Pass, an aperture no one knows—this is the knife-point elixir, most wondrous and rare.\" For the place where the two and five unite in essence is the wellspring of elixir production. The great cultivator, recognizing this empty aperture as the place of union, must be able to draw the primordial one qi from the emptiness and nothingness—how great is its function! Thus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins—all evidence of this union. Though this principle is perfectly clear and easily understood by all, in truth, no one understands it. The Immortal Master, in his vast compassion, explains it to you: you need only unite the two qi into one mass where the two eights meet, and the great medicine will be born.\n\nBut one fears that when dragon and tiger meet, they may exhale the qi of the two bowstrings, and the elixir-refiner may fail to recognize it truly.\n\n**Liu’s words:** The golden essence flourishes in abundance.\n**Li’s words:** Recognize the golden essence.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms at their finest—\nfacing the scene, forget emotion and admire the moon’s radiance.\nWhen the golden essence waxes strong, its brilliance dazzles the eye;\ndo not, in the garden, mistakenly pluck the wrong melon.\nThe five metals and eight minerals are all counterfeit;\nthe myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all amiss.\n\nThe golden toad, the jade crow—\nrecognize them truly, and you are a master of the craft.\n\n**[Liu’s annotation:]**\nThe primordial numinous treasure is firm and strong, upright and balanced, pure and refined—its blossoms are most excellent. At the time of their finest bloom, when the moon’s radiance unfolds, the golden essence flourishes in abundance, and one should admire it, lest it be lost before one’s eyes. These blossoms open month by month, appearing in season and not out of season, following the lunar cycle with unchanging regularity, their movement and stillness constant, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe golden essence is the luminous essence of metal; in the moon, it is called the moon’s radiance; in man, it is called true essence. True essence is the essence of true numinosity, never dimmed or obscured, and thus it is likened to the moon’s radiance and the golden essence. The true numinosity of man is not easily known, yet it may be understood by observing the truth of the moon and metal; the true numinosity of man is not easily seen, yet it may be perceived in the moon’s radiance and the brilliance of metal.\n\nThe essence of all things decays with time, yet the moon’s radiance unfolds month after month, and the golden essence remains undiminished for ten thousand years. Just as the moon’s radiance and the golden essence endure, so too does man’s true essence—though at times it may seem obscured, this is only because postnatal yin qi veils it, while its original substance has never been extinguished.\n\nWhen the golden essence waxes strong, it is the true essence waxing strong. When the true essence is at its peak, it illumines the world, its qi filling the cosmos—white snow flies across the sky, yellow sprouts cover the earth, golden light dazzles the eye, and wherever one turns, there are blossoms. Yet this true essence is formless and imageless, neither substance nor emptiness; it cannot be sought with intention, nor preserved with non-intention. It can only be grasped spiritually, not spoken of in words. Though it is bright and clear, fully manifest, seen by all, it is recognized by none. It is most difficult to recognize truly, and the cultivator must delve deeply into its subtleties, attaining true knowledge and penetrating insight, before daring to act—lest one mistake the false for the true, the seemingly correct for the genuinely so, and pluck the wrong melon in the garden.\n\nThose blind practitioners of the world, who stumble in their refinement, may suspect the golden essence to be something with form and image, and thus refine the five metals and eight minerals, ingesting the myriad herbs and thousand formulas—things of a different kind from ourselves. How could they ever congeal the elixir and extend their lives? Is this not a grave error?\n\nThe toad is a creature of water, belonging to yin; yet when called *golden*, it is the yang within yin, the white within black—this is our true knowing. The crow is a creature that flies above, belonging to yang; yet when called *jade*, it is the yin within yang, the feminine within the masculine—this is our numinous knowing. Only true knowing and numinous knowing are of the same kind as ourselves, the treasures of our nature and life. Taking these two and uniting them to form the elixir, true yet utterly numinous, numinous yet utterly true—true and numinous undispersed, wholly embodying the principle of heaven—neither substance nor emptiness, neither arising nor ceasing: this is what is meant by the moon’s radiance, this is what is meant by the golden essence. When the moon’s radiance unfolds and the golden essence waxes strong, how could one not attain longevity?\n\nYet most people fail to recognize what true knowing and numinous knowing truly are. If one recognizes them truly, one is a seasoned master of the Dao, and there is none who does not attain the Way. Alas! In the Way of the golden elixir, a deviation of a hair’s breadth leads to a mistake of a thousand miles. How many are those who truly recognize it?\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n\"Excellent\" signifies beauty, the designation for the golden flower. Alchemists call true lead the \"golden flower.\" As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The lead’s body is black without, yet harbors a golden flower within.\" From this black lead, one extracts white gold and pairs it with cinnabar mercury, thereby producing the primordial qi. This is precisely the \"golden flower.\" Returning it to oneself yields the reverted elixir, yet the reverted elixir must first be preceded by refining the self. When the self is purely refined, the reverted elixir comes easily.\n\nOne who \"forgets emotion in the face of scenery\" has achieved mastery in refining the self. All beautiful scenes stir no emotion; one’s sole desire is to cherish this single point of qi—this true qi, called the moon’s radiance. Why is it also named the moon’s radiance? Because the moon’s fullness serves as a gauge for the qi’s condition. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, one delights in the toad’s glow—precisely when the golden essence waxes strong.\" This is identical in method to delighting in the moon’s radiance.\n\nThe moon begins to wax on the third day; Lu Yan likens this to tender qi. By the fifteenth, it is full; Lu Yan likens this to qi at its fullest. When qi is full, the golden essence waxes strong. The golden essence is the substance that appears within the moon’s radiance—same origin, different names. When it waxes, yellow sprouts fill the crucible, and white snow suffuses the sky. To the enlightened eye, it shines resplendent as a flower. The alchemist, wielding the sword that pierces heaven, gathers it, then applies fire at the proper time to refine the reverted elixir. This flower alone is the true prize.\n\nOne must never discard the true flower to pluck false gourds in the garden, lest one come to lament the error. Not only are gourds mistaken, but the five metals and eight stones are likewise false and not true. The myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all deviations, not the Way. What one seeks—neither false nor deviant—is this golden essence alone.\n\nFrom whence does this golden essence arise? Observe the golden toad and the jade crow: these are its birthplaces. The toad, a yin creature of the water, is called \"golden\"—thus the true yang within Kan. The crow, a yang creature of the sky, is called \"jade\"—thus the true yin within Li. When true yin and true yang interact, they generate the qi of the two crescents. From the qi of the two crescents arises the true One qi. The moon’s radiance and the golden essence are both this same thing; one need only recognize it truly. If one recognizes it truly, one is a seasoned master, clear in fire times and discerning of lead.\n\n[Liu’s Explanation]\nGathering the medicinal ingredients.\n\n**[Li’s Words] Plucking the Yellow

replaced.\nOnce the intestines are renewed,\nall things become empty.\nFame, profit, love, and attachment—\nwhat is there to cling to?\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nThis fragrance is neither perceptible nor foul—an utterly pure and pristine fragrance, the fragrance of primordial arising, unstained by the postnatal realm.\n\nThe lead crucible is the external crucible. The method for refining lead requires establishing an external crucible in the southwest, called the \"Village of Kun\" or \"Mother Kun.\" The mother’s body is inherently empty and must rely on the father Qian’s solar essence to produce lead. This solar essence is the dragon’s mercury. The dragon, as the eldest son, takes the father’s place and enters the mother’s womb, where qi and essence intermingle, and the crucible of primordial true lead is thus established. Ancestor Zhong said: *\"The great yang shifts into the moon’s brightness\"*—this is the method of establishing the crucible. The following line, *\"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen,\"* refers to this state of gentle warmth. When the lead crucible is gently warm, the treasure-light appears. This treasure-light is the light of the life-treasure; when it emerges, it is the primordial qi, a white image reflected above the brows and eyes. Ancestor Lü said: *\"The lead crucible gently warm, light pierces the curtain,\"* and again: *\"Examine the space between the brows—there lies the sign.\"* This describes the same vision.\n\nThe golden bridge is the magpie bridge below, located on the path to the southwest, where the golden qi shines. The winding river is where qi encircles the magpie bridge, its light imprinting the southwest. Some of old interpreted Ancestor Lü’s line *\"On the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams pure\"* as referring to the twelve curves of the small intestine—this is a descent into demonic delusion. Others have taken it to mean the space between the mouth and nose, an even graver fall into delusion. Only Master Chen Niewan said: *\"On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance shines bright; the great medicine is born from this place. I recall an ancient verse: ‘Above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans.’\"* This truly grasps the essence.\n\nWhy is this so? The southwest corresponds to *kun*, and *kun* governs the abdomen. Where the precious light appears, the moon’s radiance shines bright; where the moon’s radiance shines bright, the golden *qi* emerges. Thus, upon the golden bridge, one gazes upon the winding river, where the moon above the river shines directly upon the golden bridge.\n\nThe moon’s radiance gleams resplendent, and within yin, yang is born—hence the saying: *\"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen.\"* The sun is *taiyang*. The three-legged crow within the sun is the essence of the sun. To swallow the crow’s liver is to ingest the solar essence of the eastern direction; to consume the hare’s marrow is to partake of the moon’s radiance from the western direction. When essence and radiance are combined in ingestion, the great medicine is born. When sun and moon are both swallowed, the golden elixir takes form—thus the line: *\"Swallow the crow’s liver and hare’s marrow, and the dust-laden old intestines are wholly transformed.\"*\n\nWhat further attachment to love, fame, or profit could disturb this pure heart? Why turn back in thought, only to waste the day in vain? On the fifteenth, [Liu Yan] tends the furnace and applies the work.\n\n[Li Yan] speaks of the work of *wenyang*—nurturing and refining.\n\nThe rootless tree bears flowers most fresh,\nAs talismanic fire sears mercury and lead.\nAt the furnace’s edge, visions arise—\nGathering all depends on the Dharma-boat.\nThe master’s hand, firm at the helm,\nLets the great waves churn the sea’s depths.\n\nCross the Three Passes, pierce the Mud Pill.\nEarly on, the nine apertures of the body are all opened.\n\n[Liu’s Commentary]\nThe treasure of true love, once worldly dust is shed,\nBecomes utterly pure and clear—how could its flowers not bloom fresh?\nYet their freshness depends entirely on the work of talismanic fire searing lead and mercury.\nTrue numinosity is the essence of true knowing and numinous knowing;\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing are the functions of true numinosity.\nTrue numinosity divides into true knowing and numinous knowing;\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing unite to form true numinosity.\nTo refine the lead of true knowing and the mercury of numinous knowing\nIs to refine true numinosity itself.\nRefining means using true knowing to govern numinous knowing,\nAnd numinous knowing to align with true knowing.\nWhen true knowing and numinous knowing congeal,\nThey restore the treasure of true numinosity—\nThe freshness of its flowers defies description.\n\nYet while true numinosity is easily formed, the firing times are most difficult.\nAs Master Ziyang said:\n*“Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.\nThe work depends entirely on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth off, and the elixir will not form.”*\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir requires gathering the medicine at the proper time\nAnd refining it with the proper method.\nWithout knowing the time or the method,\nEven if the great medicine is in sight, it will not be yours.\nThus, at the moment of tending the furnace,\nAmidst the indistinct, forms appear;\nWithin the profound darkness, essence arises.\nA single spark of true numinosity’s light\nEmerges from the formless—\nSeeming to exist, yet not existing;\nNeither form nor emptiness.\nVisions manifest—this is the moment the great medicine is born.\n\nAt this time, the Three Corpses, Six Thieves,\nThe Five Aggregates, and the Seven Emotions—\nAll manner of illusory visions—\nMay also appear before you.\nYou must steady the Dharma-boat,\nFirmly grasp the helm,\nForget the visions, and remain unmoved,\nLetting the waves churn the sea’s depths without wavering.\nThrough such effort, gradually gathering and refining,\nNurturing yang and restraining yin,\nThe longer you persist, the stronger the work becomes.\nWhen the work is complete,\nEssence transforms into qi,\nQi transforms into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into emptiness.\nCrossing these Three Passes,\nThe wind stirs in the Mud Pill,\nThe Dharma-body manifests—\nAnd the yin qi of the body’s nine apertures is all transmuted.\n\nThe Three Passes are not the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* of the alchemical tradition,\nBut the three passes of refining essence, qi, and spirit:\nRefining essence into qi is the first pass,\nRefining qi into spirit is the middle pass,\nRefining spirit into emptiness is the upper pass.\nCrossing these Three Passes, spirit merges with the Great Void,\nMoving freely without obstruction—\nThis is called piercing the Mud Pill,\nFor the Mud Pill Palace is where spirit is stored.\nThe nine apertures belong to the illusory body,\nBut once the Three Passes are crossed and the Mud Pill is pierced,\nThe Dharma-body is perfected.\nThe yin qi of the illusory body’s hundred channels and nine apertures\nIs transformed into yang qi,\nAnd every aperture shines with light—\nEven the million and four thousand hairs\nBecome guardian spirits.\nStudents must not let words obscure the meaning.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nThis chapter speaks of *wenyang*—nurturing and refining.\nWu Yuan’s interpretation—that crossing the Three Passes, piercing the Mud Pill, and opening the nine apertures refers not to the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* but to the three refinements after which spirit merges with the Void, moving freely, and the illusory body’s nine apertures all shine with light—is correct.\nHowever, the preceding lines must be understood in the context of *wenyang*.\nOtherwise, the stages of entering the chamber to return the elixir,\nNurturing the embryo, and shedding the husk\nWould all be jumbled together,\nWhich does not align with the immortal masters’ intent of explaining each stage in turn.\nThus, this passage refers solely to *wenyang*.\n\n“Fresh” means radiant—\nThe sign of deep *wenyang* work,\nRenewing day by day, flourishing month by month.\n“Talismanic fire” refers to the cyclical firing times:\nAt dawn, advancing the yang fire;\nAt dusk, retreating the yin talisman.\nThe *zi* hour is when yang is born, and fire should be advanced at *zi*,\nBut by dawn, it is the *yin* hour—\nWhy advance fire at *yin* instead of *zi*?\nBecause fire is born in *yin*, where yang qi flourishes,\nSo fire is advanced at this time.\nThe *wu* hour is when yin is born, and the talisman should be retreated at *wu*,\nBut by dusk, it is the *xu* hour—\nWhy retreat the talisman at *xu* instead of *wu*?\nBecause fire is stored in *xu*, where yin qi is concealed,\nSo the talisman is retreated at this time.\nRetreating the talisman replenishes mercury;\nAdvancing fire draws out lead.\nLead governs mercury,\nMercury embraces lead—\nLead diminishes day by day, while mercury increases,\nHence the line: *“Talismanic fire sears mercury and lead.”*\n\n“Tending the furnace” refers to the external furnace,\nNot the furnace used when entering the chamber.\nWhen entering the chamber to refine lead, a crucible is necessary,\nBut in *wenyang*, only the furnace is used, not the crucible.\nYet the furnace may be external or internal.\nAs Ziyang said:\n*“Within, there is the natural true fire,\nIn the furnace, ever blazing bright red.”*\nThis is the internal furnace.\nHe also said:\n*“For the external furnace, diligence in increasing and decreasing is key—\nNothing surpasses the true seed.”*\nThis is the external furnace.\n\nAt the furnace’s edge, wondrous visions appear—\nNot the radiance of the treasure,\nNor illusory visions,\nBut the civil fire within and the martial fire without.\nCivil and martial fires refine,\nGradually gathering, gradually adding.\nThe work of *wenyang* must not be interrupted.\nIt depends entirely on the Dharma-boat and the master’s hand,\nUnshaken by wind or waves,\nUndisturbed in its primal work.\nThen the Dharma-boat sails boundlessly,\nComing and going without cease—\nLike Bodhidharma carrying gold across the sea,\nDirectly reaching the other shore.\nHence the lines:\n*“Gathering all depends on the Dharma-boat,\nThe master’s hand, firm at the helm,\nLetting the great waves churn the sea’s depths.”*\n\nThe final three lines are already clarified in Liu’s commentary;\nNo further explanation is needed.\n\nSixteen\n[Liu’s Note] Recognize true lead.\n[Li’s Note] The singular true lead.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms in full bloom—\nRecognize true lead as the primal ancestor.\nEssence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines,\nWoman transforms to man, the old to youth.\n\nTo seize the White Tiger in the west,\nFirst tame the Green Dragon in the east.\nLike attracts like—strive well:\nWhen the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\n“In full bloom” speaks of luxuriance and abundance. Amidst the flourishing blossoms, good and bad, partial and true, mingle together. Only the true immortal blossom may be gathered and used. What is this true immortal blossom? It is true lead. This lead is the true emotion of true knowing, the manifestation of true numen. As true knowing is outwardly yin and inwardly yang—outwardly black, inwardly white—it is called true lead, or “gold within water,” or “lead of the watery realm,” or “flower within the moon.” Its names are manifold, yet all denote this single thing: true knowing. Only this true knowing contains the primordial true unity’s initial qi, the root of yin and yang, the source of the Five Phases, the seed of immortals and buddhas, the lineage of sages and worthies—the true primal ancestor of all who cultivate the Dao.\n\nOnce the ancestor is recognized and brought home, revered and upheld without a moment’s separation, essence, qi, and spirit naturally gather in the crucible, without need for force. For when the father returns, where would the child go? With the added work of talismanic fire and refinement, even a woman may transform into a man, even the old may become youthful. “Woman transforms to man” does not mean the body changes form; rather, a woman, being purely yin, through cultivation and refinement, transmutes yin into yang, becoming like a man. “The old become youthful” does not mean the face regains youth; rather, the old, their qi withered, through cultivation and refinement, return to the root and revert to the origin, becoming like a child.\n\nYet the way of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful, though it begins with recognizing true lead and true knowing, also requires first mastering the refinement of the self. If the refinement of the self is not thorough, true knowing will not come; even if it comes, it will not stay. Thus it is said: *“To lead the White Tiger from the western garden, first subdue the Green Dragon in the eastern home.”* The White Tiger belongs to the west and metal, symbolizing true emotion; the Green Dragon belongs to the east and wood, symbolizing true nature. True emotion and true nature are originally one family—why the need to lead or subdue? Because after their entanglement in the postnatal, the true is mixed with the false: true emotion becomes false emotion, kindness tinged with harm. Like a tiger leaving its den, it rushes west to wound others, no longer belonging to me but dwelling in another’s home.\n\nOnce true emotion becomes false, true nature is obscured and likewise turns false. The false takes charge, the true retreats, and nature and emotion fall out of harmony—like the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west, never meeting. To restore the true, one must first dispel the false; to lead emotion, one must first harmonize nature. Harmonizing nature is the work of refining the self. Refining the self means refining the nature of one’s temperament. When the nature of temperament is transformed, true nature naturally appears. With true nature manifest, unshaken and unmoved, true emotion also emerges. When true emotion emerges, false emotion does not arise, and the White Tiger may be led back to pair with the Green Dragon, emotion and nature entwined in love.\n\nThe White Tiger is the primal ancestor of true lead, differing only in name. Because true knowing is unyielding and strong, it is called the White Tiger; because true knowing is soft yet conceals strength within, it is called true lead. To lead the White Tiger is to gather true lead. “Leading” here is not by force but a leading without leading—when nature is settled, emotion naturally returns. This is simply the way of like attracting like, the resonance of yin and yang within and without. Nature presides within and belongs to yin—the inner medicine; emotion operates without and belongs to yang—the outer medicine. Yin and yang are originally one qi, nature and emotion share the same root. When the inner medicine flows, the outer medicine cannot but flow. Inner and outer in harmony, nature seeks emotion and emotion longs for nature. When nature and emotion unite, true numen congeals, and the symbol of the returned elixir appears.\n\nThe Pure Yang Elder said: *“When nature abides, qi naturally returns; when qi returns, the elixir naturally forms.”* The Purple Yang Elder said: *“To refine the ninefold transmutation, first refine the self and hold fast to the heart.”* Both speak of the necessity of refining the self before the elixir may return.\n\nAlas! True lead is easy to gather, but refining the self is most difficult—the work of refining the self is truly great!\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n“In full bloom” speaks of the intensity of emotion. Lead is the true lead within a person. When true lead manifests, its emotion is most intense. Simply recognize the true and gather it, and the golden elixir is immediately accomplished. For this true lead is the embodiment of the central yellow and upright position, the primal ancestor of the great elixir. Gather it to restrain mercury, and the three families meet to form the immortal infant. Extending this, thousands upon thousands, generations of descendants all trace their lineage to this true lead. Thus it is called the primal ancestor.\n\n“Essence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines” describes the state after lead returns and mercury is subdued, the three families meeting. Yet to forge true lead, there is first the wondrous art of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful. The fire of the Li Palace is true essence; the water of the Kan Palace is true qi; between Kan and Li, there is the wondrous earth at work—true spirit, also called true intent. When qi and essence interact, with spirit presiding, gold is born in the water, mercury descends in the fire. With spirit maintaining balance, regulating excess and deficiency, through fierce refinement, the fire steams and the water boils, and gold rises with the water—this is the power of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.\n\nWhen it enters the Li Palace, the fire of Li is extinguished by the water of Kan. It does not fly or flee. Qi is stabilized by spirit, essence is congealed by spirit. Lead and mercury both die, returning together to the fertile earth. The three families meet in the central palace, refined into a single purple golden elixir—this is the wondrous work of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.\n\nWhen first the Eastern House’s son entrusted his form to the West, the Western Dui became the true Maiden, the Maiden acting in place of Mother Kun. Within the female crucible appeared the Thunder Male—thus the female transformed into male. This male is called the Third Lord of the Nine, young in years, truly the Dao Father of Wood Duke incarnate in the womb of the child. Hence Wood Duke is renamed the Duke’s Son, the old transformed into the youthful.\n\nThis Duke’s Son rides a white tiger, roaming the Western lands with fierce might. Once a Daoist saw and asked him, “You, the tiger-riding youth—are you the transformation of Wood Duke?” The youth, knowing the man’s heart held true awakening, dared not conceal the truth and answered, “Yes.” The Daoist then turned and laughed, saying, “The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor. Master Cui’s words are true indeed.”\n\nNow, to summon back the Duke’s Son, one must first capture his white tiger, for the white tiger is the steed formed from the youth’s primordial qi. If you wish to journey west to seize the white tiger, you must first subdue the green dragon in the Eastern House. For the white tiger is the nature of metal; the green dragon is the nature of wood. When wood interacts with metal, fire arises within wood, and fire in turn compels metal to return. When metal merges with wood, water surges within metal, and water in turn extinguishes fire to stabilize it. These four, though distinct, are in truth the same—different in kind yet alike in essence.\n\nSince they are of the same kind, employ your mysterious skill to bring them together. Thus, inner and outer unite, outer returns to inner submission, and when the outer medicine connects with the inner, the inner medicine likewise connects with the outer. This passage speaks only of true lead, not of true mercury, for where there is lead, there is mercury—though mercury is unspoken, it resides within. Hence it is said, “When the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.”\n\nLead, qi, male, youth, tiger—all are outer medicine. Essence, female, elder, dragon—all are inner medicine. As for spirit, it abides between the inner and outer essence and qi.\n\nSeventeen methods of gathering the firing timing.\nSix gates of firing timing.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms fair,\nHeaven answers stars, earth answers tide.\nThe dragon-slaying sword, the tiger-binding cord,\nTurning the Big Dipper’s handle, the Northern Asterism’s pivot.\nForging a crucible of true sun and moon,\nSweeping away three thousand six hundred paths.\nAscending cloud-laden skies, roaming free at will,\nSin, filth, and mundane dust—all erased with one stroke.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation] The true spirit lies concealed within the postnatal, obscured by accumulated habits and guest qi. Its blossom is most difficult to unfold. Occasionally, when it does emerge, a single gleam of radiance pierces through the void—like a pearl, like dew—tender, delicate, and exquisitely fair. Its appearance is most fragile, as if opening yet not fully open. The primal qi, undifferentiated and whole, in heaven responds to the stars’ brightness (though not yet full), and on earth to the soil’s moisture (though not yet damp). The brightness of stars and the dampness of earth are both signs of yang qi’s initial stirring.\n\nWhen yang qi first stirs, it is the tender moment of the true spirit’s blossom. At this very instant of fragility, the conscious mind may seize upon the spirit’s light to spawn delusion, scattering nature and shifting emotion. One must swiftly apply fierce firing and rapid refinement, nip deviations in the bud, and guard against subtle errors—nurturing yang while suppressing yin—to protect the treasure of life.\n\nThe dragon-slaying sword serves to curb the temper of qi; the tiger-binding cord serves to restrain delusive emotions. When the temper of qi does not flare, the true spirit manifests; when delusive emotions do not arise, true feeling is born. With true nature revealed and true feeling born, one revolves the Northern Asterism’s pivot and turns the Big Dipper’s handle, transforming killing into life and converting punishment into virtue. Thus can one forge and refine a crucible of true sun and moon.\n\nThe sun is the image of yang containing yin, an analogy for the numinous awareness inherent in true nature. This awareness is the female within the male, true yin. The moon is the image of yin containing yang, an analogy for the true knowing inherent in true feeling. This knowing is the white within the black, true yang. Forging and refining true yin and true yang—these two great medicines—returns them to a single qi, which congeals into the elixir. Swallowed and ingested, it extends life and reverses destiny.\n\nThis is the most sublime and wondrous Dao, not one of the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths that cling to emptiness or fixate on forms. For when the great Dao is accomplished, one ascends cloud-laden skies and roams freely at will, and all sins, filth, and mundane dust are erased with a single stroke. Those three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, however, merely tinker with the stinking skin-bag, only inviting more sins, filth, and mundane dust—how could they ever erase them?\n\n[Li’s Exegesis] “Fair” describes the tender delicacy of the moment when the first yang sprouts. Heaven corresponds to the upper, earth to the lower. At the time of yang’s birth, a flicker of starlight appears above the brows (the ancients called this “heaven responding to the stars”), and a vast tidal qi surges within the abdomen (the ancients called this “earth responding to the tide”). Such are the signs of the medicine’s arising—this is no falsehood.\n\nMaster Wuyuan likened the stars’ brilliance in heaven and the dampness of earth to the initial stirring of yang qi, neither full nor moist, which is also a valid interpretation. Others cite *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, where “heaven responding to the stars” refers to the upper magpie bridge, and “earth responding to the tide” to the lower magpie bridge—both hold profound principles. Yet I have privately heard that “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide” pertain to aligning with the moon and the hour: the stars awaken one to the moon, the tide to the time. This is precisely the crucial firing timing of the great returning elixir.\n\nI excerpt a few lines from the *Cantong Qi* as corroboration:\n*“The metal reckoning is fifteen,\nThe water number is the same.”*\n\nBefore the furnace, fix the weight in two *zhu*,\nFive parts water remain in excess.\nWhen these two are taken as true,\nThe gold’s weight returns to its origin.\nIf the third enters, it will not do—\nTwo parts fire must accompany it.”\n\nThis is the true meaning of “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide.” The gold must weigh fifteen *liang* precisely because it aligns with the moon’s number, signifying the full vigor of metal’s essence. Over 5,048 days, the celestial *qi* first reaches completion, and fifteen *liang* of gold can generate fifteen parts of water—this corresponds to the first fifteen days of the lunar month. The water’s number matches the gold’s number, just as the tide’s number aligns with the stars’. If gold and water are insufficient, true water will not arise; this is what is meant by “heaven not responding to stars, earth not responding to the tide.” How then can one fix the weights?\n\nTo truly respond to stars and tide, take the first fifteen days of the lunar month as the standard. From new moon to full, count one and a half days as one part. Two such periods—three days—usher in *geng*. Only then does two parts of true water emerge: heaven responds to stars, earth to the tide. By the fifth day, it becomes three parts—three parts are unusable. By the eighth day, it reaches five parts—five parts are excessive. Neither aligns with the stars or tide.\n\nOnly when two parts of water are paired with two parts of fire does true alignment occur—this is the authentic response to stars and tide, the true sign of *kan* water. When gold first generates water, at precisely two parts, the source is utterly pure, possessing *qi* but no form: this is the *White Tiger’s* first channel. As the tiger exhales its breath, the dragon meets it with two parts of true fire, refining it into the elixir’s foundation.\n\nAs for the gold that generates two parts of water, it must wait until the fifteenth day, when the metal’s essence peaks and the water’s tide arises. This is the “two sevens’ period,” when true lead first descends—this is responding to stars and tide.\n\nSome may ask: *Why must the fire be precisely two parts?*\nAnswer: In one hour’s work, divided into three *fu* and six *hou*, only one *fu* and two *hou* of fire are used. Thus, dragon and tiger remain balanced, devouring and being devoured in turn. At the critical moment, one must wield the sword to subdue the dragon and grasp the cord to tame the tiger. Circulating the *gang* and turning the Dipper, returning to the central palace, the sun and moon conjoin their essences. Refining and tempering them, the true Way is attained.\n\nMy teacher from Wuyi Mountain offers an even more precise and illuminating explanation, which I now detail here.\n\n*Qian* heaven is yang; stars are heaven’s fire essence, yang within yin. *Kun* earth is yin; tides are earth’s water *qi*, yin within yang. Essence is the father of fire, *qi* the mother of water. When *Qian*-father and *Kun*-mother unite, *li* fire and *kan* water are born. Thus it is said: “Heaven responds to stars, earth responds to the tide.” “Responding” denotes the mutual resonance between them.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*“Without stars and moon,\nHow could water be gathered?”*\nFrom this, we know that when heaven’s light illumines earth, it responds with stars; when earth’s *qi* bears heaven, it responds with tides.\n\nThe immortals liken heaven’s stars to the fire within the human heart—fire is one’s nature, and nature belongs to the dragon. If it does not descend, the stars scatter and fire disperses. Thus, one must wield the dragon-slaying sword to subdue it; the sword represents great wisdom. They liken earth’s tides to the water within the human body—water is one’s emotions, and emotions belong to the tiger. If it is not tamed, the tide overflows and water flows unchecked. Thus, one must grasp the tiger-binding cord to subdue it; the cord represents great insight.\n\nGreat skill appears clumsy; great wisdom seems foolish. When insight and wisdom merge into darkness, the wondrous mind arises. To turn the *gang* and wield the Dipper’s handle requires the wondrous mind’s power.\n\nThe *gang* is the Northern Dipper. The Dipper governs life, residing in its handle. Wherever the handle points, life-giving *qi* arises. The human body’s wondrous mind, by moving the Dipper’s handle, can transform killing into life. As the Dipper’s handle revolves, the golden elixir enters within. When the golden elixir enters, the wondrous mind returns to me.\n\nThe wondrous mind is the true body, neither born nor destroyed, its virtue merging with heaven and earth, its brightness uniting with sun and moon—it is the true sun and moon within the human body. To seek the wondrous mind, one must return from the postnatal to the prenatal. First, cause the external sun and moon to exchange their light externally, mastering the firing times and understanding the *fu* and *ke*. Only then can it be attained. Upon its return, the internal sun and moon must exchange their light internally, shining ceaselessly day and night. By harmonizing and nurturing them, one forges a furnace of true sun and moon.\n\nThis is the wondrous secret of the golden elixir’s great Way, the profound mystery of the seven returns and nine refinements. It sweeps away the 3,600 side paths, allowing one to ascend the clouds and roam freely, erasing all karmic dust and worldly filth in a single stroke. Without understanding this great Way, there will never be a day of liberation. Karmic dust and worldly filth will only accumulate—how can one fail to awaken?\n\n**[Liu’s Note]** Reverse the mechanism of *qi*.\n**[Li’s Note]** Skillfully employ the art of theft.\n\nThe rootless tree’s flowers bloom high,\nOcean waves surge as the moon plays with the tide.\nThe Silver River’s path pierces the nine skies,\nThe raft’s shadow spans the void, striking the Dipper’s tip.\nTouching the Weaving Maid’s loom stone,\nTreading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge,\nEntering the immortal court with bold courage,\nStealing the Queen Mother’s peaches from Jasper Pool.\n\n**[Liu’s Commentary]**\nThe primordial great Way encompasses heaven and earth, governs the movement of sun and moon, and transcends all existence. Its flowers bloom so high they resemble the moon in the sky, its light reaching the ocean’s depths. Though ocean waves surge to the heavens, water cannot drown the moon’s light—instead, the moon plays with the tide. This is like a person in the sea of suffering: circumstances cannot harm their true nature but instead refine it through adversity.\n\nAgain, the Silver River’s path is distant, piercing the nine skies, yet humans cannot easily cross it. However, with a celestial raft spanning the void and turning the Dipper’s handle, one can traverse it. In ancient times, Zhang Qian rode such a raft across the Silver River and witnessed the Cowherd and Weaving Maid stars meeting—this serves as proof.\n\nIn terms of principle, the world also possesses its celestial raft, capable of crossing the Silver River. What, then, is this worldly celestial raft? It is none other than the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir operates within the void, capable of revolving heaven and earth, reversing yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood—this is the celestial raft. Yet the marvel of the celestial raft lies in the manipulation of the Dipper’s handle. The Dipper’s handle is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, Yaoguang, also called the Celestial Stem. Where the Celestial Stem points is auspicious, where it rests is inauspicious, for where it points, the qi of life resides. In the instant the Dipper’s handle is turned back, yin and yang unite, and the sprouts of life emerge effortlessly—hence the saying: *“Grasp the Weaving Maid’s shuttle stone, tread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.”* The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the Cowherd to yang; the magpie bridge is where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet. By grasping the shuttle stone and treading the magpie bridge, yin summons yang, and yang comes to meet yin—when yin and yang unite, the Golden Elixir takes form. This principle is enacted within the waves, its workings performed in the void, enabling one to enter the ranks of immortals, with boldness of spirit, and steal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. The Jasper Pool lies in the west, and the Queen Mother is the ancient yin, the Mother of Earth. The peach is the Elixir, the single yang of the *Zhen* trigram. The Queen Mother’s peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within; the Elixir resides in the west, but when stolen and returned to the east, it becomes one’s own, and the Elixir is restored. Yet the marvel of this restored Elixir lies in the union of yin and yang, and the marvel of their union lies in reversing the qi mechanism amidst the waves of the great sea, unmoving and unshaken. To remain unmoving and unshaken amidst the waves of the great sea is the mark of a man of bold spirit—what heaven among the nine skies cannot be ascended? What Silver River cannot be crossed? What Queen Mother’s peaches cannot be stolen? Those who cultivate stillness and forget form, acting only within quiescence, how could they know of this?\n\n---\n\n*[Li’s Explanation]*\n\"High\" refers to the void. The surging waves of the sea are what Master Ziyang called the time when \"the winds and waves are fierce, and the Mysterious Pearl is born.\" As the wind rises and waves surge, their sound shakes the void—hence \"surging to the heavens.\" Yet the Mysterious Pearl, like a round autumn moon, appears upon the sea—thus \"the moon plays with the tide.\" To reverse the flow of the Silver River and pierce the nine skies is like Zhang Qian riding the raft, its shadow spanning the void, the qi mechanism reaching its apex. Yet for the river raft to advance, there must first be guidance, lest the waters overflow their course and stray from the river’s path—this is why the Dipper’s handle serves as the mooring. The word \"moor\" is most apt: for mortals, mooring a boat means resting for the night, but for the immortal’s river raft, the Dipper’s handle is the anchor. To proceed straight and true, one cannot moor—yet to speak of \"mooring the Dipper’s handle\" is precisely to moor where one cannot, where one must not, mooring upon the Dipper’s handle. Following the Dipper’s revolution, movement contains stillness, death gives way to life—just as heroes and bold men act with unbridled resolve, their sails catching the wind without mooring, for this is the moment of grand resolution and great opportunity. Not mooring surpasses mooring, and mooring is as good as not mooring—such is the meaning of \"mooring the Dipper’s handle.\"\n\nThe Weaving Maid and the Cowherd are the celestial yin and yang stars, meeting once a year on the seventh night of the seventh month. The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the shuttle stone likened to mercury; the Cowherd belongs to yang, the magpie bridge the place where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet, the direction where gold and mercury unite. Above, the Dipper’s handle is mentioned; here, the Cowherd and Weaving Maid—thus the Dipper serves as their matchmaker. Without the Dipper, the Cowherd cannot meet the Weaving Maid; when the Dipper turns, the Cowherd crosses the river, and gold unites with mercury. As Ancestor Lü said: *“The work of advancing fire lies in the peril of the Cowherd and Dipper,”* and Niwan said: *“The marvel lies in the tail, the winnowing basket, the Dipper, the Weaving Maid, and the Cowherd,”*—both express this same idea. To grasp the shuttle stone is to have mercury receive lead; to tread the magpie bridge is to have lead and mercury travel the same path. From this, one’s heavenly fate is secured, and one’s aspirations can be fulfilled—one may encounter the immortal ranks and become bold of spirit. Why is this? Because one has stolen the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. Wuyuan’s explanation—that the Jasper Pool lies in the west, the Queen Mother is the Mother of Earth, the peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within, and the Elixir in the west is stolen and returned to the east to form the restored Elixir—is clear, yet the word \"steal\" is not as vivid as \"thieve.\" To thieve the peach from the east is one matter; the *Kan* trigram as thief is another. To thieve the peach from the east is to go to the west to obtain gold; the *Kan* trigram as thief is to seek lead from the depths of water. How marvelous is the meaning of \"thieve\"!\n\n---\n\n*[Liu’s Words]*\nYin and yang wrestle and congeal.\n\n*[Li’s Words]*\nGiving birth to the Mysterious Pearl.\n\nThe Rootless Tree,\nits flowers in full bloom,\nDragon and Tiger mount the altar for battle.\nLead enters mercury,\nyin and yang unite,\nthe image of the Mysterious Pearl is priceless.\nThis is the true seed of one’s homeland,\nrestoring youth and prolonging life.\nAscend to heaven,\nto the Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nand escape the wheel of rebirth to meet King Yama.\n\n*[Liu’s Annotation]*\nThe Golden Elixir is the image formed by the clash of yin and yang—thus the flowers must be in pairs to be of use. Yin and yang are the Dragon and the Tiger, lead and mercury. The Dragon is true nature, mercury is numinous awareness, also called the primordial spirit, both belonging to yin; the Tiger is true emotion, lead is true knowledge, also called the primordial essence, both belonging to yang. The Dragon and Tiger battling is the gathering of nature and emotion. Lead entering mercury is the congealing of spirit and essence. When nature and emotion gather, spirit and essence congeal, yin and yang unite, and the single qi blends—true numinosity becomes perfectly luminous, the Dharma-body takes form, round and resplendent, like a single Mysterious Pearl, a priceless treasure.\n\nThis treasure is no external object—it is the true seed of one’s own homeland, originally inherent, yet lost without trace after mingling with the postnatal. Now, with yin and yang harmonized, what was nonexistent is restored, what had departed returns. Planted in the homeland, with the root established the Way arises, generating endlessly, reversing aging to regain youth, extending life without limit, ascending to the heavenly realm of ultimate bliss, and escaping the suffering of rebirth.\n\n[Li’s Exegesis]\nThe \"pair\" refers to the qi of the two crescents. When the qi of the two crescents unite, Dragon and Tiger mount the altar, mutually devouring and reflecting. \"Battle\" signifies this devouring. After a great struggle, Dragon and Tiger reach equilibrium: when the Tiger battles the Dragon, lead is cast into mercury; when the Dragon battles the Tiger, yin is matched with yang. When yang-lead and yin-mercury merge, this priceless treasure is born. As the *Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"Tiger leaps, Dragon soars—waves surge rough,\nAt the central true position, the Mysterious Pearl is born.\"*\nThe Mysterious Pearl is the primordial singular qi, the original source of immortals and buddhas, the true seed of one’s own homeland, not an external thing. Veiled by the postnatal, it long ceased to manifest. Now, within the Dragon-Tiger altar, yin-mercury and yang-lead unite as true husband and wife, returning from within postnatal Kan and Li to the prenatal. Thus it is said: *\"The Dharma-image of the Mysterious Pearl is beyond price.\"* From this true seed of the homeland, those who obtain it reverse aging to regain youth, prolong life, ascend to heaven, attain ultimate bliss, and escape the wheel of rebirth to avoid facing King Yama.\n\nThis speaks of the method of Dragon and Tiger, yin and yang, battling and uniting—one must seek its firing times in the annotation to the chapter *\"When the Flower Is Most Radiant.\"*\n\n[Liu’s Note]\nThe Elixir of Return is achieved in a single moment.\n\n[Li’s Note]\nThe Returned Elixir’s nurturing and refinement.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms most wondrous,\nCultivated in moonlight for but a fleeting moment.\nWith hands that seize the clouds, one ascends the cloud-ladder,\nPlucking the first branch of the prenatal.\n\nDrinking wine and wearing flowers, the spirit soars bright,\nLaughing at the immortal elders sunk in drunken mud.\nEntrusting the knowing heart, guarding with care,\nEver fearful the furnace’s firing time may flee.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nThe prenatal true numen, though nonbeing, gives rise to being;\nthough incomplete, it achieves wholeness—its blossoms most wondrous.\nYet what makes it wondrous is this: the prenatal, veiled by the postnatal,\nvanishes without trace. Should one wish to cultivate it,\nin but a fleeting moment it revives spring.\nThe marvel of this revival lies in plucking the first branch’s blossom.\nThe first branch is the ancestral qi of all life,\nthe numinous root that gives birth to heaven, earth, and humankind.\nIt does not fall into form, nor into emptiness;\nconcealed, it is true emptiness; manifest, it is wondrous being.\nUtterly centered, utterly upright, utterly refined, utterly pure,\nit flickers in the indistinct and obscure, like dew, like lightning.\nIt cannot be sought with intent, nor held with non-intent.\nSought with intent, one clings to appearances;\nheld with non-intent, one clings to emptiness.\nIt lies in settling the nature and forgetting the passions,\nturning the light inward in reflection,\nemptying to the utmost, stilling to the profound.\nNot plucking, yet plucking; not taking, yet taking—\nnaturally, the true unity of the prenatal qi\narises from the formless,\ncongealing into a pearl like a grain of millet.\nWithin and without, radiant with light,\nas if wearing immortal blossoms,\nthe spirit soars unimpeded, as if drinking immortal wine.\nWearing blossoms, drinking wine—joy abounds therein,\nunaware, unknowing, following the decree of the Lord.\nOne enters the realm of intoxication.\n\nAt this moment, the Returned Elixir has formed,\nand the face of one’s birth-mother is seen anew.\nNo need for external furnace adjustments—\nhasten to the inner furnace’s nurturing and refinement.\nThe numinous works in silence,\nguarding with vigilance, the intent undivided,\never watchful lest the firing time err.\nThe \"knowing heart\" is not an external knower,\nbut the heart that knows itself within.\nThe firing time’s swiftness or slowness, the heart knows of itself.\nKnowing yet not deluded, the firing time does not err,\nand the Golden Elixir ripens.\n\n[Li’s Exegesis]\n\"Wondrous\" means beyond human fathoming.\nNot only humans cannot fathom it—\neven yin and yang cannot fathom it.\n\nIf one could fathom it, then yin and yang would fail, intermingling in boundless obscurity—how then could one cultivate the primordial? That which is cultivated in the moon’s embrace: on the third day, when *geng* emerges, the medicinal substance is fresh and tender. Within this *geng* phase of the moon, one cultivates the golden flower, blending two parts fire with two parts water, stewing in primordial chaos for a moment—only then does the first primordial sprout emerge within the crucible. This is the work of a fleeting instant.\n\nIn that instant, when the first primordial sprout truly appears, the wondrous heart takes charge, immediately reversing the celestial pivot, soaring back across the Milky Way—this is the hand that grasps the clouds, the ladder that ascends them, the gathering of the first primordial sprout. The drinker of wine drinks this first immortal brew, and the primordial transforms into white nectar. The wearer of flowers dons this first immortal blossom, and the primordial returns with vernal yang. Flower is wine, wine is flower; to drink it and wear it is to have wine as one’s good companion and flower as one’s dear friend. The spirit and qi surge in harmony, utterly intoxicated—hence it is said, *\"Drink wine, wear flowers, the spirit soars bright; the immortal elder laughs, drunk as mud.\"*\n\nThe \"knowing heart\" is the heart in accord, the wondrous heart within oneself. Vigilant guarding means observing the firing time with this wondrous heart. Yet guarding entails several aspects, and the furnace fire has two phases: if the firing time is insufficient, one withdraws and supplements with *zhun* and *meng* to protect it, requiring external furnace adjustments; if the firing time is complete, one guards it day and night with contained radiance, needing no external furnace adjustments. When the ten-month count is full and nine years have passed, the true person emerges from the crown of the head.\n\nOtherwise, if the external furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will be insufficient and the elixir will not mature; if the external furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will be excessive and the elixir will surely be harmed. If the inner furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will not be refined and the elixir will lack potency; if the inner furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will stagnate in dullness and the elixir will not emerge. All these are errors in the furnace’s firing time. It is thus hoped that the knowing heart, through meticulous vigilance, will avoid such errors.\n\n\"Flying\" signifies deviation—this should be read in light of the earlier chapter *\"When the Flowers Truly Fly.\"*\n\n[Liu’s Exegesis]\nHarmonizing yin and yang.\n\n[Li’s Exegesis]\nObtaining the medicine and returning the elixir.\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in true yellow,\nis born in the central land of wu and ji.\nThe eastern household’s maiden, the western house’s youth—\nas husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.\nThe Yellow Matron urges them to drink the ghee-wine,\neach day growing drunk in a haze of intoxication.\nThis immortal formula, the soul-returning nectar,\nraises the dead and revives the living—it is the King of Medicines.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nYellow is the true color of the central wu and ji. Wu, as yang earth, governs movement; ji, as yin earth, governs stillness. When wu and ji unite at the center, they form the true trust, also called the true intent. When the flower’s hue is true yellow, the true numen has entered the central, correct position. Yet for the true numen to be centered and upright, one’s nature and emotions must be as one. The eastern household’s maiden is the nature of wood; the western house’s youth is the emotion of metal. One nature, one emotion—paired as husband and wife, they enter the secluded bridal chamber. With the Yellow Matron urging them to drink the ghee-wine and harmonizing the firing times, what was not in harmony must harmonize, and once harmonized, it remains so. The ghee-wine is not the dregs of the mundane world, nor is it the tangible substances of essence, fluids, or blood within the body. It is the qi of intermingled yin and yang in harmonious union, coalescing into the true unity of essence, flowing as the true unity of water—fragrant and sweet in flavor. The ancients called it \"jade liquid,\" \"nectar,\" \"sweet dew,\" or \"ghee,\" all terms that describe this single point of harmonious qi. To \"urge drinking\" means to regulate what is not harmonious until it reaches perfect harmony. In the practice of the Dao, when yin and yang attain perfect harmony, one remains constantly responsive yet still. From afar, one observes phenomena, yet phenomena are no longer phenomena; up close, one observes the body, yet the body is no longer the body; inwardly, one observes the heart, yet the heart is no longer the heart. Unknowing and unperceiving, one follows the decree of the Emperor. Daily, one drinks the ghee-wine and enters the realm of intoxication. This intoxicated delight is the immortal’s formula, the soul-returning nectar—able to raise the dead, able to revive the living. It is the great King of Medicines. \"Central,\" \"wu and ji,\" and \"Yellow Matron\" are all alternate names for the true trust. In terms of yin-yang harmony, it is called \"central\"; in terms of yin-yang movement, it is called \"wu and ji\"; in terms of yin-yang harmonization, it is called \"Yellow Matron\"; in terms of activity, it is called \"true trust\"; in terms of stillness and stability, it is called \"true intent.\" Thus, one thing has many names, but in sum, it is merely the one true trust. Recognizing this trust, one must apply solid effort upon it. First, seek emotion through nature; then, return emotion to nature; then, harmonize nature and emotion; then, merge nature and emotion into oneness, forming a single true numinous treasure. From beginning to end, nothing succeeds without this one trust—how great is the function of trust! When reduced to its essence, the centered and upright true numen is the union of nature and emotion. When nature and emotion unite, the true trust resides within. When the true trust manifests, nature and emotion naturally do not separate, and the true numen is naturally centered and upright. These three depend on and yet give rise to one another.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nYellow is the true color, the correct awakening of the Buddhist school, the correct qi of the Confucian and Daoist traditions. In the Buddhist canon, it is called \"yellow flowers\"; in the immortal classics, it is called \"yellow sprouts.\" Yet there are two kinds of yellow sprouts: one is the new medicine of the third day, the other is the great medicine of the fifteenth day. As *Awakening to Reality* states: \"Where yellow sprouts arise, kan and li conjoin\"—this refers to the new medicine of the third day. Where yellow sprouts arise is where kan and li should unite to plant the second yellow sprout. *Awakening to Reality* says: \"Plant the yellow sprout, and it gradually grows\"—this is the second yellow sprout, the great medicine of the fifteenth day. The growth of the yellow sprout truly arises from the union of kan and li. This union of kan and li occurs in the central land of wu and ji. The center is where essence and qi coalesce; the land of wu and ji is where movement and stillness harmonize. Once harmonized and coalesced, in an instant, the yellow sprout is born from within—hence it is said, \"born in the central land of wu and ji.\" This yellow sprout has many names; in this chapter, it is the western house’s youth. The western house’s youth is the qi of metal; the eastern household’s maiden is the essence of mercury. Gathering the qi of metal to subdue the essence of mercury—this is the Dao of returning metal and mercury, the pairing of husband and wife entering the bridal chamber. Once in the bridal chamber, the Yellow Matron must guard them. The Yellow Matron is the \"knowing heart\" mentioned in the previous chapter. If the couple fears discord, their spirit, intent, and qi will struggle to enter the realm of harmony, and the elixir will not form. Thus, the Yellow Matron must attend to them, urging them to drink the ghee. The ghee is the essence of external nurturing warmth, the qi of internal harmonious union. The Yellow Matron is the intimate confidant; the firing times in the furnace will naturally not err. Between dawn and dusk, she urges them to drink frequently, each day growing drunk in a haze—truly a joyous affair. This wine is not mundane wine but the wine brewed by the immortal’s formula, called the soul-returning nectar. It can raise the dead and revive the living; neither minor nor external medicines can compare. It is the King of Medicines. This chapter describes the work of the fourth firing time after seeking lead in the second firing time. Seeking lead is an external affair: on the third day, when the moon emerges in geng, one applies effort. This is called \"pairing water with fire,\" \"the dragon approaching the tiger,\" \"yin meeting yang,\" \"li uniting with kan,\" \"nature harmonizing with emotion,\" \"mercury investing lead,\" \"the maiden marrying the man\"—all methods of using the postnatal to generate the prenatal. In sum, it is the union of essence and qi, an external medicine. Its work lies externally, requiring only one talisman and two firing times to establish the foundation of the elixir.\n\nThe Reverted Elixir.\n\nThis is an internal affair. One applies effort at the time of the full moon on the fifteenth day, calling it \"using water to extinguish fire.\" This water is the water of celestial menses. It is also called \"the tiger marrying the dragon,\" where the tiger is the tiger of the western direction; \"yang subduing yin,\" where yang is the yang containing the true; \"kan filling li,\" where kan is the prenatal kan; \"emotion returning to nature,\" where emotion is the emotion of metal; \"lead restraining mercury,\" where lead is the lead of True Unity; \"the man pairing with the woman,\" where the man is the pure qian; \"using the prenatal to restrain the postnatal.\" In sum, it is the union of true qi with true essence—an internal medicine. Its work lies internally, requiring two talismans and four firing times to congeal the Golden Elixir.\n\nAll this has been left undifferentiated by the ancients; here I expound it in detail, that when reading elixir scriptures, one may clearly distinguish between the two medicines.\n\nTwenty-two\n[Liu’s words] Congealing the Sacred Embryo.\n[Li’s words] Capturing and subduing the Fiery Medicine.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms now bright,\nThe moon’s yin essence presses close to the sun’s yang spirit.\nGolden Crow’s marrow, Jade Rabbit’s essence—\nThese two things captured and simmered in one place.\nYang fire and yin talismans divide at midnight and noon,\nBathing rites added at the gates of mao and you.\nGuard the Yellow Court, nurture the Valley Spirit,\nA man conceiving an embryo—how laughable it seems!\n\n[Liu’s commentary]\nThe prenatal true numen, its original luminous body,\nPierces heaven and earth, illuminating all—this is the blossoms’ brightness.\nWhat makes it bright is the harmony of yin and yang qi.\nA person’s singular self is purely yin, like the moon’s darkness without light.\nOnly by borrowing another’s deathless method does yang arise,\nAs the moon borrows sunlight to become bright.\nThe moon’s yin essence pressing close to the sun’s yang spirit—\nYin and yang in union—can, at the heart of heaven, shine brilliantly.\nThis is the merging of true knowing and numinous knowing,\nThe image of the true numen unobscured.\n\nThe Golden Crow’s marrow is the sun’s yang spirit,\nIn humans, the feminine within the masculine—\nThe true yin of numinous knowing.\nThe Jade Rabbit’s essence is the moon’s yin essence,\nIn humans, the white within the black—\nThe true yang of true knowing.\nEarlier, it spoke of crow’s liver and rabbit’s marrow;\nHere, it speaks of crow’s marrow and rabbit’s essence—\nThere is a great distinction; they must not be viewed as the same.\nFor crow’s liver and rabbit’s marrow are the medicinal substances of the Reverted Elixir,\nThe true knowing and numinous knowing of yin and yang yet to unite but on the verge of union—\nThus, the liver of the crow, the marrow of the rabbit.\nCrow’s marrow and rabbit’s essence are the medicinal substances of the Great Elixir,\nThe true knowing that can be numinous, the numinous knowing that can be true—\nYin and yang already united and in harmony—\nThus, the marrow of the crow, the essence of the rabbit.\nYet to unite but on the verge of union is forced effort,\nThe false returning to the true.\nAlready united and in harmony is natural function,\nThe true becoming even truer.\n\nGather these two true medicinal substances and knead them into one,\nRefine forth the yang within yang,\nThen apply the fire-tending of zi, wu, mao, and you—\nThus is the Golden Liquor Great Elixir perfected.\n\nYet what is called zi, wu, mao, and you\nIs not the zi, wu, mao, and you at the edge of the sky,\nBut rather the zi, wu, mao, and you within the body.\nWhen true knowing appears, it is zi;\nThe method is to use firm advancing fire to stir the true knowing forth from the mysterious.\nWhen numinous knowing arrives, it is wu;\nThe method is to use gentle retreating tally to draw the numinous knowing into the feminine.\nWhen true knowing advances to the central equilibrium, it is mao;\nThe method is to ice-bathe this central equilibrium so it does not advance excessively.\nWhen numinous knowing retreats to the central equilibrium, it is you;\nThe method is to ice-bathe this central equilibrium so it does not retreat excessively.\nThis is the Dao of tally-fire and ice-bathing,\nAn unchanging method for ten thousand ages.\nIf one applies effort according to the zi, wu, mao, and you at the edge of the sky,\nOne strays far indeed.\n\nWhen tally and fire are not in error,\nWhen bathing aligns with the proper time,\nYin and yang respond to each other,\nNeither leaning nor tilting—\nThe Mysterious Feminine is established,\nAnd the Valley Spirit arises within it.\n\nThe Yellow Court is the central and correct position,\nThe single aperture amid the union of yin and yang,\nAlso called the Gate of the Mysterious Feminine.\nWhen primal yang and feminine yin unite, yin and yang merge,\nThis aperture exists;\nWhen yin and yang are askew,\nThis aperture does not exist.\nWhere this aperture exists, there is the Valley;\nWhere there is the Valley, there is the Spirit.\nWhere this aperture does not exist, there is no Valley;\nWhere there is no Valley, there is no Spirit.\nThe Valley is the Yellow Court.\nYellow is the color of the center;\nCourt means emptiness.\nBecause it is empty within, it is named the Yellow Court.\nEmpty, it is numinous;\nNuminous, it is Spirit—\nThis is called the Valley Spirit.\n\nObserve the mountains:\nTwo cliffs stand facing each other,\nBetween them a valley.\nWhen one calls out, the valley echoes—\nThis echoing sound is the Valley Spirit,\nCommonly called the \"cliff baby.\"\nWhen human yin and yang unite,\nA Spirit dwells within—\nIt is just like this.\nYet if one has not reached the state where yin and yang unite,\nThere is no center,\nNo Valley—\nHow can a Spirit reside there?\nOnly when yin and yang truly unite\nDoes a center appear,\nDoes a Valley form,\nAnd the Spirit arise of itself.\nThis is what is meant by \"the primal qi comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness,\"\nBy \"true emptiness yet containing wondrous existence,\"\nBy \"to keep the Valley Spirit from ever dying, one must rely on the Mysterious Feminine to establish the root.\"\n\nWhen yin and yang merge into one qi,\nThe Valley Spirit abides steadfast in the Yellow Court—\nThis is called \"a man conceiving an embryo.\"\nTo \"guard the Yellow Court\" is to guard the center.\nTo \"nurture the Valley Spirit\" is to embrace the One.\nGuarding the center and embracing the One,\nAfter ten months the work is complete,\nA body exists beyond the body,\nAnd one endures as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThese are true and real dharmic signs,\nWorks accomplished within emptiness,\nNot wrought from form and appearance.\nThose who fiddle with circulation techniques on the stinking skin-bag,\nFalsely hoping to form the sacred embryo—\nHow could they know what makes the Valley Spirit the Valley Spirit?\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nBrightness is the arising of the Great Medicine,\nThe empty chamber giving birth to white,\nRadiating great luminosity—\nThe time of great awakening, great enlightenment.\nThis Great Medicine is the yang within lead,\nThe gold within cinnabar,\nThe primal within the primal—\nLike the moon’s dark essence at the heart of heaven,\nPressing close to the sun’s yang soul,\nForming a radiant orb of light,\nNot like the sliver of the third day,\nFar at the sky’s edge,\nNear as the crescent brow.\n\nThe word \"pressing\" is crucial—\nIt means intimate closeness,\nThe two refining each other in one place.\nSun and moon unite as jade discs,\nThe sun’s yang soul pours entirely into the moon’s dark essence,\nA thousand miles of brightness,\nThe heart of heaven gleaming like snow.\nSeize the two and refine them together—\nNot seizing the Golden Crow and then the Jade Hare,\nBut seizing the Golden Crow to grasp the Jade Hare,\nSeizing one thing to thereby seize both.\nAt the moment of seizing,\nThere are the four phases of zi, wu, mao, and you, the fire at the gates.\nThus the Golden Crow flies into the Palace of Broad Cold,\nAnd with the marrow of the Golden Crow,\nThe essence of the Jade Hare is harmonized.\nThen the essence of the Jade Hare\nIs entirely transformed into the marrow of the Golden Crow—\nOnly then is the moon’s dark essence pressing the sun’s yang soul,\nSkillfully refined in one place.\n\nAt this time,\nThe yang soul is full,\nThe yin essence formless—\nTwo things become one,\nOne thing contains two.\nYin is exhausted, yang is complete,\nGreat luminosity radiates—\nThus it is called the yang within lead,\nThe gold within cinnabar,\nThe primal within the primal.\nAt this stage,\nIt is the Great Medicine of Golden Liquor,\nAnd one applies the work of ingesting it according to the four phases of zi, wu, mao, and you—\nOnly then is it the Great Return Elixir of Nine Revolutions.\n\nWhat time is zi?\nWhen yang arises, it is zi—\nThus one advances the yang fire.\nWhere is wu?\nWhen yin descends, it is wu—\nThus one retreats the yin tally.\nIce-bathing means natural adjustment,\nNeither hurried nor slow.\nThis work should be applied\nWhen the yang fire approaches mao,\nWhen the yin tally approaches you—\nThus yang does not exceed firmness,\nYin does not exceed softness,\nFirmness and softness attain the mean,\nEntry and exit are in proper measure.\n\nFormerly, Master Tao Cuncun elucidated the secret of fire-tending in the *Triple Concordance*,\nAnd recorded his teacher’s *Fire-Tending Song* in his commentary.\nI deeply admire it,\nAnd now append it here as corroboration.\n\nThe song says:\n\"I recall my immortal elder’s Daoist methods,\nAll were those moves of our own house.\nOriginally there was no adding or withdrawing at zi and wu,\nHow could there be rabbit and chicken, punishment and virtue?\nAsk: When is my zi?\nAnswer: At the time the medicine arises.\nAsk: When is my wu?\nAnswer: When the medicine faces the Golden Gate.\nAsk: When is my mao?\nAnswer: When the Red Child stands in the Cave of Fire Clouds.\nWithout the Guanyin Who Saves from Suffering,\nThe Great Medicine would surely burst.\nThis is the time for bathing—\nBeyond this, the boat and oars of the Yellow River.\nAgain ask: What is the you gate?\nAnswer: When the Conception and Governor Vessels unite.\"\n\nAt this moment, if there is no Yellow Skirt,\nHow can the medicine attain primal auspiciousness?\nBeyond this lies the *xu* treasury—\nPray inquire into the treasury’s secrets.\nThis is the mind-to-mind transmission of the One Thread,\nThe Supreme Dao requires no other seeking.”\n\nWhen the medicine arrives at the *mao* gate,\nOne must employ the stillness of Guanyin.\nGuanyin’s stillness governs with strict restraint,\nPreventing the Red Child from seizing power—\nThen sweet dew arises.\nAs for the *you* gate,\nIt is wrapped in the Yellow Skirt,\nPreventing the primal pearl from spilling—\nThen the white fluid congeals.\nSuch is the wondrous use of ice-bathing.\n\nThe Yellow Court is the center.\nThe Valley Spirit is emptiness and numinosity.\nAbiding in the center to nurture emptiness and numinosity,\nThe Dharma-body manifests its image—\nA man resembling a woman with child,\nLaughable yet endearing indeed.\n\n**Twenty-Three**\n*[Liu’s words:]*\nTrue emptiness, Dharma-form.\n*[Li’s words:]*\nPerfect penetration, self-so freedom.\n\nThe rootless tree,\nIts blossoms now crimson—\nPluck all the red blossoms, and the whole tree is empty.\nEmptiness is form, form is emptiness;\nDiscern true emptiness within form.\nWhen true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,\nYet the Dharma-form endures, never falling into emptiness.\nNamed Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,\nNine generations ascend beyond the nine heavens.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir takes as its destination\nThe transcendence of all phenomena in soundlessness and scentlessness—\nHow could blossoms possess crimson hue?\nIf even the slightest trace of color remains,\nThe postcelestial qi and temperament are not yet fully transformed,\nAnd the Great Dao remains unaccomplished.\nThe ancient immortals said:\n“Not a shred of yin qi may remain if one is to become immortal.”\nFor if a shred of yin qi remains,\nA shred of yang qi is incomplete,\nAnd the true spirit may still suffer damage—\nThis cannot be called the Great Elixir of the sevenfold return and ninefold restoration.\nThe cultivator must pluck all the red blossoms,\nEradicating the adventitious dust-roots accumulated since beginningless kalpas,\nReturning to the state where all things are empty,\nRestoring the soundless, scentless visage prior to parents’ birth.\nYet this “emptiness” does not mean the lifeless stillness of wood or stone.\nThere is a Dao of borrowing the provisional to perfect the real,\nAnd using the real to transform the provisional—\nHence: “Emptiness is form, form is emptiness;\nDiscern true emptiness within form.”\nTo be wholly without mind is to cling to emptiness;\nTo harbor even the slightest mind is to cling to form.\n“Emptiness is form” means it is not empty;\n“Form is emptiness” means it is not form.\nNeither empty nor formed, yet both empty and formed—\nThis is true emptiness abiding within form.\n“When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,\nYet the Dharma-form endures, never falling into emptiness”:\nTrue emptiness, once realized, settles all matters.\nOriginally without form,\nYet since form vanishes, the Dharma-form remains;\nAnd since the Dharma-form remains, it cannot fall into emptiness.\nBecause it is true emptiness, the Dharma-form exists;\nBecause the Dharma-form exists, there is no form—\nNo form, yet Dharma-form abiding:\nThus emptiness is true, and truth is emptiness.\nWhen cultivation reaches the point where true emptiness bears the Dharma-form,\nAnd the Dharma-form preserves true emptiness,\nThe wondrous existence of the One Spirit,\nPerfectly penetrating the Dharma-realm,\nBecomes an indestructible vajra-body—\nWater and fire cannot assail it,\nBlades and weapons cannot harm it,\nTigers and rhinoceroses cannot wound it—\nAnd it is called the Great Hero.\nNot only does one ascend to the ranks of immortals,\nBut even nine generations of ancestors rise to the heavens,\nBecoming deities together.\nIn former times, when Śākyamuni Buddha cultivated the sixteen-foot golden body,\nAnd his Dharma-form dwelled in the Hall of the Great Hero,\nIt was this very Dao.\n\n*[Li’s explanation:]*\nRed is the symbolic form of the Great Medicine.\nThe immortal master’s *Daoist Sentiments Song* and *The Rootless Tree*\nAre both essential works—\nFrom them, this may be understood.\nThe *Daoist Sentiments Song* says:\n“Of all phenomena, none are of the same kind;\nA single red radiance is the utmost truth.”\nWhen red radiance appears,\nIts blossoms are crimson;\nWhen the red blossoms are in hand, the true medicine is obtained.\nApart from these red blossoms, no medicine can be gathered.\nOnce the work of gentle nurturing is complete,\nFurnace and crucible are entirely set aside—\nAll those blossoming trees are no longer discussed.\nThus: “Pluck all the red blossoms, and the whole tree is empty.”\nOnce the blossoms are empty, my Dao is attained;\nOnce my Dao is attained, emptiness is no longer empty.\nSince emptiness is no longer empty, emptiness is form;\nForm is not substantial form—it is the form of the Dharma.\nDiscern that true emptiness is not empty,\nAnd true emptiness abides within form.\nThis “form” is not the form of form,\nBut the form of the Dharma.\nWhen true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes entirely;\nWhen form vanishes entirely, the Dharma-form endures forever.\nThe enduring Dharma-form is true emptiness not empty.\n“Perfect penetration” means merit and practice are complete,\nAll dharmas are penetrated,\nAnd the substance and function of true emptiness are perfected.\nOnce called Perfect Penetration, one must be called the Great Hero;\nOnce called the Great Hero, one must become the patriarch of immortals—\nHow could nine generations of ancestors not ascend,\nRising together beyond the nine heavens?\n\n**Twenty-Four**\n*[Liu’s words:]*\nReturn to the formless.\n*[Li’s words:]*\nAttain the rank of the Three Purities.\n\nThe rootless tree,\nIts blossoms now formless—\nWithout appearance or shape, hard to depict.\nNameless, yet responsive to call,\nSeized and placed within the alchemical furnace.\nIgnite the Samādhi fire of the microcosmic orbit,\nTemper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\nVisit the immortal capital,\nReceive the celestial tally—\nOnly then is one a true man, a great hero.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe treasure of the primordial true spirit\nIs fundamentally empty,\nA single qi harmoniously blended—\nHow could there be blossoms?\nWithout blossoms, without form or image,\nIt cannot be depicted or drawn.\nIf it cannot be depicted or drawn,\nHow could it have name or surname?\nYet though nameless and surnameless,\nIt is utterly empty and utterly numinous—\nStill and unmoving,\nYet responsive when stimulated,\nLike an echo answering a call:\nWithin true emptiness, the wondrous exists.\nWith this marvel of responsiveness,\nOne seizes the moment of resonance to act,\nPlacing it within the alchemical furnace of the Three Fields,\nUsing the true fire of Samādhi to temper and refine it to perfection.\nFrom true emptiness, one may return to the Great Void.\n\nThe Dao returns to the Great Void, where emptiness itself is empty—nothing remains but the One True. There is no other thing.\n\nThe Three Fields are not the common alchemical terms for *qi*-sea, Crimson Palace, or Muddy Pellet; rather, they are the Elixir Fields where the Three Treasures—essence, *qi*, and spirit—converge. This is called the Gate of Primordial Transformation, also known as the Primordial Pass, the Central Yellow Court, the Alchemical Furnace, the Altar of the Great One, or the Gate of Wuji. In sum, it is the Cavern of Emptiness.\n\nThe treasure of the primordial true spirit governs the Three Substances—essence, *qi*, and spirit. When the true spirit is restored, the Three Substances are likewise restored. They transform of themselves, harmoniously blending in undifferentiated unity. First, from nonbeing they create being; then, from being they return to nonbeing. The refinement of true emptiness is precisely the marvel of transforming being into nonbeing. When being is thus transformed into nonbeing, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Great Void in oneness. With merit and practice complete, one ascends to the Immortal Capital to receive the celestial mandate, becoming a Perfected One of the Ten Poles and the Great Primal Chaos—a true man whose great work is fulfilled.\n\n*In Praise:*\nRevealing the hidden depths of Laozi and Zhuangzi,\nContinuing the heart-transmission of Zhong and Lü.\nUnveiling the wondrous principle of the primordial,\nCleaving open the tangled paths of empty suspension.\nThe crucible’s right and wrong distinctly judged,\nThe medicine’s truth and falsehood plainly seen.\nEmptiness and form blend into a single *qi*,\nHard and soft match as two strings in harmony.\nAh!\nThe alchemical method’s beginning and end fully disclosed,\nThe fire-tally’s advance and retreat wholly inscribed.\nTwenty-four verses of the immortal’s formula—\nWhoever grasps them becomes a deathless immortal.\n\n*[Li’s Commentary:]*\nThe word \"nonbeing\" carries forward the meaning of \"emptiness\" from the previous chapter, deepening it to conclude the twenty-four verses. To refine the elixir to the point of emptiness is already perfect, yet if one clings to the notion of true emptiness, the notion of dharmic form remains. Emptiness still falls short of nonbeing. As Lord Lao said: *\"Observe emptiness as empty; emptiness itself is empty. What is emptied is already nothing; even nothingness is nothing. Abiding in utter stillness.\"* Only this is the great liberation, the great awakening, the great purity, the great perfect enlightenment. Why? Because the wondrous being of utter stillness appears as emptiness, and emptiness as nonbeing—beyond all form, beyond depiction or illustration. Precisely because it is formless and imageless, it is difficult to depict or draw; it simply abides in utter stillness.\n\nBefore this, in gathering the primordial, there were those named after metals—gold for essence, yellow for the sprout, white for the primordial. But this utterly still true reality has no name or surname. Though nameless, it responds to every call, like an echo in an empty valley, answer following answer. Question it with words, and it receives the command as if facing you—this is the utmost subtlety in the world. Still and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated—this is the utmost spirit in the world. Why? Because this utterly still true reality is hidden within nonbeing.\n\nThe principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas penetrate the workings of creation. Within nonbeing, being is concealed. At this stage, the uncanny and wondrous manifest—such as Leng Qijing, Zhang Jinghua, and Immortal Zhou Dian. Our Master Sanfeng, embodying the Dao, must seize nonbeing with nonbeing and enter the central realm of emptiness. Through great creation and transformation, within the furnace he circulates the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere, refining and tempering until the dharmakāya of emptiness returns to the Great Nonbeing.\n\nThe Great Nonbeing is the realm of the sagely perfected—such as the Jade Purity’s Primal Chaos Great Heaven or the High Purity’s Crimson Primal Nonbeing Great Heaven. Those who refine the immortal Dao receive only the ranks of the Great Purity. But those who return to the Great Nonbeing first pay homage to the Dao and its Power, then to the Jade Emperor, and finally to the Primordial Beginning, attaining the fruit of the Three Purities.\n\nThe word \"return\" signifies that all foolish men and women are originally beings of the Three Purities. Yet due to karmic delusion, they descend age after age, remaining foolish men and women, unable to regain the realm of the sagely perfected. If they turn their hearts toward goodness, seek the Dao, and find a teacher—progressing from foundation-laying and self-cultivation through the seven reversals and nine returns, refining to emptiness and then to nonbeing, and from nonbeing returning to the Great Nonbeing—they once again become guests of the Three Purities.\n\nYet refining true emptiness requires the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere does not refer to the river chariot but to movement within the heavens, the subtle workings in the void, the profound and mysterious transformations of the Dao’s natural law. Samādhi does not refer to yang fire but to the union of heaven-one and earth-two as three. Within heaven and earth, I establish the crucible and furnace. Spirit and *qi* merge in obscurity—this is the fire of immortal refinement, the celestial primordial elixir.\n\nWith merit complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the Three Heavens, visits the Immortal Capital, receives the celestial mandate, and may be enfeoffed as a Perfected Lord, an Imperial Lord, a Heavenly Venerable, or appointed as a master of the Five Peaks, the sacred mountains, the grotto-heavens, or the blessed lands to select immortals. Only then is one a true man, the greatest of men—divine to the utmost!\n\n*In Praise:*\nScattering flower-rain across the sky,\nSpreading golden earth below.\nHand clapping fish-drum and clappers,\nMouth singing the immortal hymns of the Upper Grotto.\nDelivering the four continents,\nEternally embodying the Dao’s sentiment.\nAh!\nWherever one awakens to the true spirit,\nFirst hold fast to our school’s essential intent.\nThe mountain man proclaims the true formula by the book,\nBroadly opening the nondual gate to deliver the world.\n\n*[Original Notes:]*\nWu Yuan said: \"I do not know what tune this is.\"\nHanxu said: \"Those who sing *Daoist sentiment* are called *pulling dark clouds*.\"\nIn the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, \"subtle\" is written as \"precarious,\" which also conveys the sense of decline.\nIn the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, \"green\" is written as \"pure,\" yet \"green\" signifies the freshness of new growth, akin to purity untouched by defilement.\n\"Wall-top\" is written as \"jade flower,\" and \"jade flower\" as \"wall-top\"—I have seen both versions.\n\nThis annotation interprets \"wall-top\" with depth, so I follow it.\n⑸ *Fixed*: The *Kongqing Cave Heaven* edition of *Wu Gen Shu Er Zhu* writes it as \"wisdom,\" which is correct.\n⑹ *Original Note*: The *Wuyuan* annotated edition writes \"又向\" as \"旋趁,\" differing in character but identical in meaning. However, \"才经\" is written as \"残经,\" which some interpret as human desires—thus \"gathering\" is meant to repel the yin thief—yet this risks compounding error with error.\n⑺ *Original Note*: The

Man Li Hanxu\nCollated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian\n\n**Daoist Sentiment Poems (Twenty-Four)**\n\nMen say it is good to be human,\nI say being human is endless toil.\nEven if wealth and rank mean nothing to me,\nMust I still yearn day and night for the immortal isles?\n\nAs for me,\nHánxū is a Daoist.\nBorn into this world uncommon,\nYet my rebirth was amiss.\nFrom childhood, I mumbled a few words,\nAnd in adulthood, I was tangled in vines,\nDreaming of fame that would echo through ages,\nOr of soaring as an immortal on earth—\nAll these fancies left me with nothing achieved.\nFortune’s five phases align,\nAnd by grace, I still have a thatched hut,\nThree fellow Daoists,\nRoaming carefree, high above the mortal dust.\nLaughing and smiling,\nWe linger among streams and stones.\nLate autumn, early winter,\nWith no affairs in the mountains,\nWe brew a pot of chrysanthemum wine,\nAdmire the early plum blossoms,\nAnd softly chant Daoist poems.\n\nAlas, since descending into this world,\nI recall my past life as a cold scholar,\nLightly drifting in a boat between Húnán and Húběi.\nWhy did I vow to seek the Western Paradise?\nWandering through clouds, waters, mist, and mountains.\n\nAnd pity those born into this world,\nWho enter the womb and lodge their souls,\nEach layer of parents bestowing kindness.\nTheir faces resemble their fathers and mothers,\nNurtured with warmth and tender words.\nBorn as human—this is fortunate,\nBut one must know to cherish it.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths to gain a human form,\nOne must understand the causes sown in the great kalpa.\n\nThe Pure Yang Ancestor’s compassion is boundless,\nUrging us to value this body before us.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao—\nNot a speck of mundane thought may arise.\nHear my recitation:\nSpring water is muddy when it leaves the mountain, clear within it;\nI regret my past journey into distant lands.\nSuddenly seeing so much splendor,\nOnly then do I realize how hard it is to remain unmoved by circumstances.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao—\nWhere does the Dao-heart arise?\nThe melody of wind and springs winds through ten thousand pines,\nYet it cannot compare to the ten-mile expanse of a tranquil lake.\nThe moon hangs at the heart of the sky, the cold rests in the water,\nSuddenly cooling the mind’s earth.\n\nCultivators of the Dao—\nThe superior begin from nothing to create being.\nMy family’s elixir method comes from Yíngzhōu,\nStarting with emptiness and nothingness.\nFear not the absence of signs,\nFor one must seek the root in nothingness.\n\nFirst, refine essence into qi.\nOn the yīn qiāo vessel, qi drifts hazily,\nSo much true essence lies within.\nGather it into emptiness and refine it into qi—\nA path opens to Pénglái’s distant shores.\n\nSecond, refine qi into spirit.\nSpirit and qi merge into the boundless,\nSuddenly hearing the true scripture chanted in the void.\nThe five directions, the five qi swirl around,\nAnnouncing the birth of the spirit from the primordial azure.\n\nThird, refine spirit to complete nature.\nThe immortal qi must be sought in stillness,\nFew on the red-dust path understand.\nSitting in the central courtyard for three months of fragrance,\nA golden sprout grows an inch deep.\n\nThose who leave the household—\nAfter refining essence to generate qi,\nSome effects will appear.\nDaily, guide the qi to the mud-pill palace,\nSweet nectar gradually fills the tip of the tongue.\nIrrigating the three fields, nourishing the hundred vessels,\nNaturally, essence grows and the valley spirit is at peace.\n\nWhen sweet nectar fills the mouth each day,\nThe immortal heart arises.\nOn a jade isle, dwelling in seclusion,\nThe Pure Yang Ancestor sits high in a painted pavilion.\nSweeping the floor, burning incense—utterly idle,\nOnly the flower studio’s leisure remains.\n\nWith the immortal heart comes stillness of mind.\nDeep in misty mountains, one lingers.\nFrom this, literary thoughts turn to elixir refinement.\nSleeves rolled with white clouds, returning to the cave abode,\nHead bowed, eyes closed, seated on the rush mat.\n\nWith stillness of mind comes the true heart.\nAll that is known and perceived is false;\nOnly the unknown and unperceived give birth to truth.\nA single somersault shatters the primordial chaos,\nAnd one sets out to become a Daoist in the Eastern Realm.\n\nWhen the true heart appears, the true seed is ever-present.\nGold meets wood, mercury lingers,\nThe infant and the maiden meet—how joyous!\nLast night, the Lady of the Cinnabar Terrace sent a sweet dream,\nAnd a red pill was conceived.\n\nWhy is it called \"from being to non-being\"?\nCongeal the jade liquid into elixir wealth,\nPlace it in the Kūn palace—truly still.\nSuddenly, a single yang rises from the earth,\nThe elixir’s resources return to me without guesswork.\n\nWhy is it called \"from non-being to being\"?\nTrue lead emerges from the great void,\nPlanted in the Lí palace, born in the Kǎn palace.\nI see the golden sprout burst forth in luxuriance,\nWhile others speak of white snow filling the emptiness.\n\nWhy is it called \"joining for long life\"?\nMercury’s nature is light and fond of flight,\nLead’s essence is heavy and never fails to consume.\nIn refining the elixir, if passion returns to nature,\nOne will surely ride a green phoenix into the Tàiwēi realm.\n\nWhy is it called \"life within killing\"?\nLead meets mercury in distress, yet bestows grace within harm,\nMercury, bound by lead, is reborn from death.\nIf the wondrous treasure lacks restraint,\nThe work of immortality will not be perfected.\n\nHow does one meet the Green Maiden and give birth to the sacred embryo?\nThe Green Maiden is young and adept at cultivation,\nNot a solitary yīn—her body cannot generate life.\nAfter meeting in the bridal chamber,\nThey share a bed for ten months to bear the embryo.\n\nHow does one transfer the cauldron and shift the embryo, so the child begets grandchildren?\nThe Great Dao ascends step by step,\nOnce the returned elixir is achieved, one meets the immortals.\nYear by year, the fire’s timing adds to the household,\nGazing toward Pénglái, the spirit soars.\n\nHear the mountain man speak of the wondrous principles of nurturing life—\nThere is much joy in them.\nI wonder, in ordinary times, which masters and immortals did you admire?\nThe Pure Yang Recluse, old Chén Tuán,\nA carefree immortal of the Five Dynasties.\nThe joy of the clapper and fishing rod beyond the world,\nUnmoved by chaos, naturally at peace.\n\nAnd which immortal master did you follow?\nThe Great Yuan’s remnant elder, known as Sānfēng,\nWho vanished at the end of the Yuán dynasty.\nOnly when the Chéngpíng era arrived did he reappear,\nDelighting in drifting clouds and flowing waters among lofty pines.\n\nAs for me, the carefree Hánxū of the Daoist sentiment poems,\nThese twenty-four chapters express it all.\nIn Chángyǐ Mountain, there is nothing else—\nA single fish-drum, a single lyric.\nTo restrain the heart is the method; Daoist sentiments dispel cares.\n\nIf you wish to ascend to the Great Luó Heaven,\nYou must refine your heart.\n\nAbandon thoughts of fame and fortune, sever ties to profit and desire.\nEven if gossamer threads of calculation arise, fierce fire burns them away to reveal the celestial nature.\nOne end rises, one end severs—\nOnly subtraction is seen, no addition.\nFear not the ten thousand restless \"heart-monkeys,\" nor the thousand galloping \"mind-horses.\"\nPractice internal work, breathe into the dantian.\nGuard the true breath, and purity comes naturally.\nPlunge into profound darkness to draw forth auspicious mist.\nIt tingles my Crimson Palace, intoxicates my limbs with languid softness.\nThis is my true method for taming dragons, my technique for slaying serpents.\nPassed down everywhere among mortals, the celestial mechanism is not sold for silver.\nWealthy disciples present gifts in homage; impoverished disciples follow fate as it comes.\nThey remain unfeigned, I remain incorrupt—\nNow, after three years of digging the well, I seek to establish some karmic merit.\nWho could know the perversity of destiny, the hardship of the times?\nFamily fortunes decline, heroic spirit wanes, and the elixir furnace is utterly neglected.\nYet should the winds of fortune shift one day, I’ll cast off all and roam carefree to the immortal isles.\n\n**The Heart-Mind Chapter**\nIts heart-mind luminous, its functions manifold.\nIts spirit profound, its substance serene and steadfast (I act not, yet qi naturally coalesces).\nThus the ancients directly grasped the \"non-spiritual spirit\" as the true spirit.\n\n**Cultivating the Heart-Mind**\nSweeping away resentment and desire is no hardship;\nWhen the heart-mind is at peace, the body too is at peace.\nThe moon casts its clear light upon still waters,\nThe wind carries coolness around the winding balustrade.\nBuddhist scriptures penetrated, vexations vanish;\nDaoist teachings attained, a steadfast vision arises.\nEver restrain the heart-mind within the chamber of the chest,\nWalking alone, sitting alone, pacing alone.\n\n**Three Poems on Emptiness**\nPracticing is easy, attaining is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir is made.\nIf the world seeks a place to stabilize the tripod,\nWithin this realm, the expanse surpasses the heavens.\n\nLoving is easy, delighting is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir is made.\nIf the world seeks where the life-nourishing medicine grows,\nWithin the gourd, the immortals’ altar already stands.\n\nAttaining is easy, preserving is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir coalesces.\nIf the world seeks where to establish destiny,\nFrom beginning to end, it is all one undivided whole.\n\n**Cultivating the Elixir**\nMassage and daoyin techniques,\nEasy to encounter, hard to perfect.\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nHard to encounter, easy to practice.\nPracticing is not without difficulty,\nYet it can be aligned with longevity.\nModeled on heaven and earth,\nTempered in nature and emotion.\nNature and emotion interact,\nEchoing through the empty valley.\nManifestations transform and change,\nThe work lies in stillness and clarity.\nHeart-mind clear, qi clear—\nBeneath the earth, thunder rumbles.\nThunder shakes heaven and earth,\nThe two phases unite in true essence.\nDragon and tiger wage a great battle,\nIn the wild, supreme peace is established.\nThe three yang open the myriad apertures,\nGathering medicine into the central camp.\nFrom this, for ten months,\nThe gentle fire nurtures the fetal immortal.\nSplitting open the mud-pill peak,\nCarefree, one ascends to the Jade Capital.\n\n**Discoursing on the Art of Immortality**\nOf old, there were gods who did not die,\nBut no bodies that did not die.\nThose whose spirit attains non-death\nAre precisely those who attain immortality.\nWhen mortals die, their spirit perishes;\nWhen immortals die, their spirit endures.\nThe gulf between endurance and perishing spans heaven and earth,\nImmortals and mortals are not of the same rank.\nIn the world, centenarians\nMay endure many springs.\nYet as old age approaches,\nTheir true nature grows dim and lost.\nBewildered by avarice and desire,\nTheir will and vitality fade into stupor.\nBefore death, the body is already in chaos;\nBefore rebirth, past causes are obscured.\nNot waiting for the next life,\nThey sink into ruin before their very eyes.\nWho can embrace this wondrous art?\nDwelling in leisure, refining the primordial spirit.\nEven if one cannot escape death,\nThe numinous nature alone transcends the dust,\nRoaming carefree between heaven and earth,\nPlaying the flute in the wake of Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Lamenting the Pass of Sensual Desire**\nThrough the ages, the greatest fools\nLove beauty as they love flowers.\nThrough the ages, the most foolish\nAre insatiable in their greed.\nIndulgence in desire harms the essence,\nLike a violent gale stripping the forest of its blossoms.\nThe *Guo Feng* warns against sensuality,\nYet still, there is a touch of elegance.\nThe dissolute revel in desire,\nTheir kind no better than swine.\nThose who cultivate both sensuality and the Dao\nMeet ruin and lamentable ends.\nBetter to take a fair maiden,\nSever desire, and refine cinnabar.\nHow wondrous was Zhang Guolao,\nWho tended garden melons with his wife.\nHow illusory was Yi Yongchang,\nWho sang of clouds and mist with his spouse.\nBoth sages were enamored of beauty,\nYet in the world beyond, their love was rare.\nThe perfected have no lustful thoughts,\nThe root of desire is severed, never to sprout again.\nI admire the immortals of old,\nWhose celestial consorts were their true partners.\n\n**Those Who Cultivate the Dao Should Sever Desire**\nThe Great Elixir employs the furnace and cauldron,\nMetaphors for refining and nurturing the medicine.\nThe vulgar, failing to understand, heap scorn and slander—\nThis is the fault of clinging to literal words.\nIn jest, I mimic their phrasing\nTo clarify the meaning for the rigidly conventional.\n\nFourteen ounces of refined gold\nCan forge the immortal’s crucible.\nTake the lead within *gui*,\nTo mend the losses within my body.\nCrimson silk nurtures the true nature,\nThe alchemical chamber holds fine vessels.\nOnce the work is complete, all are discarded,\nSelecting companions for shared cultivation.\n\nThere was a young man from the eastern household,\nIn the prime of his years, keen and perceptive.\nKan and Li inverted and overturned,\nNature and emotion mutually affirmed.\nThese are my numinous parents,\nTogether entering the grotto-heaven to seclude themselves.\nWhen the Dao is perfected, a family of immortals,\nThe Great Luo will come to welcome them.\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Master Ma Bicheng’s \"Declining Health in Prosperity\"**\nThe year of the Boar ends, the Rat begins,\nWinter’s start already reveals spring.\nThe first yang returns to its origin,\nMyriad things gradually contain the new.\nSnow-covered earth, rivers and mountains gleam,\nFrost-laden sky, the atmosphere is true.\nIn the cold garden, fine fruits ripen,\nTangerine wine reveals the spirit’s fullness.\n\n**Awakening at Dawn**\nTen thousand matters fail to go as wished,\nReturning, I chant poetry again.\nThis body should be singularly good,\nMy Dao is not entirely mistaken.\nSpring arrives swiftly, swallows come early,\nThe night is cold, the cock crows late.\nThe morning star is as large as a bowl,\nFew know the celestial signs.\n\n**After the Double Ninth, Inviting Disciples to Roam the Muyi Hermitage**\nEmptiness congeals into emerald, following the azure vastness,\nClapping hands, singing as we ascend.\nI wish all beings to ascend the realm of longevity,\nWhere the immortal spring is truly fragrant for the elderly.\n\n**Double Ninth at the Yang Zheng Residence**\nOn the Double Ninth, the sky drizzles like silk,\nIn the Hall of Nurturing Integrity, the wine cup is raised.\n\n**Jade Wine and Shared Resonance**\nJade wine intoxicates, yet one remains unaware,\nFine words await guests, few truly understand.\nOnly you and I share this tune in harmony,\nKnees pressed close, hearts converse in wondrous speech.\nWhen shall we ride twin white cranes together,\nBeneath Green City Mountain to seek the magic lingzhi?\n\n**To the Tune of \"Man Jiang Hong\" – First Variation**\nClapping hands, singing aloud,\nI sigh—mortals flicker like candle flames,\nLaughing at lives spent in vain, deaths in futility,\nWhat resolution can there be?\nThe arena of fame and profit stretches wide, yet battles yield but emptiness,\nThe debts of poetry and books weigh heavy, faces seek elixir formulas.\nWhen shall you roam the seas and skies, Master?\nPermit me to speak.\n\nParents still live, yet home is hard to leave.\nDebts of gratitude run deepest, ties are hardest to sever.\nLoosen the reins of fame, return instead to the thatched hut.\nMillet and beans bring joy as we till the verdant fields,\nMountain cups toast longevity with golden chrysanthemums.\nOnly when I’ve served the white-haired elders\nShall I make my final decision.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Man Jiang Hong\" – Second Variation**\nPray tell, esteemed sirs,\nWhat does it mean to cultivate immortality or Buddhahood?\nFirst, one must thoroughly grasp the Confucian classics,\nThen we may speak of this together.\nNurturing nature and preserving the heart embrace the wondrous Dao,\nCultivating the body and establishing destiny transmit the true formula.\nWithin vastness, the elixir is refined,\nRiding the dragon forth.\n\nWhen heaven’s fortune prospers, sages are nurtured.\nWhen the lord’s Dao flourishes, talented ministers arise.\nLaugh at our own carelessness and sloth—\nWhy offer uncut jade?\nWho in this world has exhausted all worldly achievements?\nThe winds and waves of mortal life are boundlessly treacherous.\nBetter far to serve the mountains and forests,\nAnd withdraw early.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Man Jiang Hong\" – Third Variation**\nThe eight-legged essays and literary works\nAre but dregs of the Six Classics.\nWorse still, slick and glib tones are added—\nWhere is the truth in any of it?\nThe fawning postures of the times are truly laughable,\nThe rush for fame—why so frantic?\nRelying on poetry and prose to become a high official,\nTo build a family legacy.\n\nFirst, the learning is flawed,\nPower once grasped, greed takes hold.\nWeighing copper coins heavily,\nWhile soldiers and common folk are cast aside.\nIf only there were a clear-sighted official who discerned right from profit,\nYet without silver to offer, even he becomes an enemy.\nSee how our kind, emerging from the mountains, must\nHastily retreat.\n\n**Nine Characters of the Great River’s Western Lineage**\nThe Western Dao connects,\nThe Great River flows east,\nThe sea and sky stretch boundless.\n\n**Inscription by Patriarch Lü**\nThe Great River’s first patriarch is Pure Yang,\nAfter nine cycles, the elixir is perfected, the Dao’s qi flourishes.\nToday, the transmission of the heart holds no other words—\nMay each of you steer the vessel of compassion.",

      "translated_text": "*The* Fanghu Waishi *(Outer History of the Square Flask)* is the title of works by Lu Qianxu of the Eastern Lineage. *The* Yuanqiao Neipian *(Inner Chapters of the Round Peaks)*, then, is the title of works by Li Hanxu of the Western Lineage. Thus was established the opposing stance of East and West, and thus too was the Dao of their shared inheritance determined. The Western Star (Lu Qianxu’s alternate name, Lu Xixing, also called Chang Geng) and the Western Moon (Li Hanxu’s courtesy name, Tuanyang, also called Li Xiyue) illuminated one another, their radiance resplendent—how could this be mere chance?\n\nYet within the Daoist lineages, all know only of the *Fanghu Waishi* in circulation, while none are aware of the publication of the *Yuanqiao Neipian*. Why is this? For no other reason than that disciples and compilers of the Western Lineage failed to grasp the original intent behind the Patriarch Li’s writings. Lacking systematic organization, each piece bore its own title, and so the overarching name *Yuanqiao Neipian* was entirely submerged, its traces all but lost.\n\nMaster Chen Yingning, the late president of the Daoist Association, wrote prolifically with profound insight, yet even he was not immune to the irony of \"seeking the ox while riding it,\" lamenting in his works *Daoqiao Tan* (*Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures*), *Sanche Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*), and *Yuanqiao Neipian* that they had never been published and that he had not even seen a manuscript. The eminent scholar Li Daoshan, in his *Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu*, likewise noted: \"(The Patriarch) received the mandate of the Three Perfected Ones and composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern Elder Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Song of the Rootless Tree*... all of which were published. However, *The Inner Chapters of the Round Peaks*, *The Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Apertures* remain unpublished.\" Alas!\n\nLittle did they realize the principle of correspondence between the two works—external alignment and internal alignment as inevitable complements. I racked my brains, exhaustively studying the classics, yet could not reconcile the discrepancy. Given the full title’s symmetry of inner and outer, how could it be that a monumental work of such grandeur had vanished without a trace, never to be published? Reluctantly, I turned again to *Hanxu Mizhi* (*Secret Essentials of Hanxu*, a volume in the *Eastern Daoist Cultivation Library*). By chance, while poring over the preface to *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures of the Most High*, I grasped the key. The preface was written by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu, who concealed their true names. It reads:\n\n\"One day, while wandering among Daoist temples, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi* (initially intended to parallel the Eastern Patriarch’s *Fanghu Waishi* and thus also called *Outer History*; later revised to *Inner Chapters* for symmetry, though it is the same work). Among them was *Annotations on the Thirteen Scriptures*, with the commentary on the *Daode Jing* being the most exhaustive. Appended was *Xuntu Jiu Ceng* (*Nine Layers of the Path*). Though brief, these few words suffice to reveal its essence and resolve the enigma.\"\n\nI then examined the preface by Master Pure Yang, which states:\n\n\"Hanxuzi was a transcendent talent... Upon hearing the teachings, he immediately gained insight and, roused by his own abilities, composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi* as a counterpart to Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has *Xuanfu Lun* (*On the Subtleties of the Mysterious*), this work has *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has *Jiuzheng Pian* (*Seeking Rectification*), this has *Xuntu Shuo* (*Discourse on the Path*). Most wondrous of all is the commentary on the *Daode Jing*, which serves as an eternal beacon, titled *Donglai Zhengyi* (*Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*), on par with Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo* (*Supplementary Ink to the Southern Florescence*).\"\n\nReading this, I could not help but clap in admiration, for at last the truth became clear. Thus, I have compiled the Patriarch Li’s various works into a single volume.",

      "translated_text": "Herein it is rightfully titled *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao*, fulfilling the long-cherished wish of Patriarch Li. Some say that the Western Patriarch Li Xiyue was the reincarnation of the Eastern Patriarch Lu Xixing. In the *Records of Spiritual Resonance* shown to me by Li, he himself did not deny this. Thus, history may cycle, human nature may reappear, and images may repeat. Reading the \"Three True Poems\" in the *Eastern Advent of Right Meaning*, how can one not marvel at the wonder!\n\nAmong them, Lu Xixing’s poem reads:\n*\"A single commentary can unlock the profound mysteries of the Dao,\nOnce more the purple qi arrives from the East.\nStrumming the zither, playing the flute—a true scholar,\nExpounding the Dharma, discoursing on sutras—a master of eloquence.\nI dwell in Square Pot, gazing upon the vast sea,\nYou ascend Yuanqiao, overshadowing Penglai.\nToday, seated together by the riverside pavilion,\nReciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly.\"*\n\nIs this praise for Li? Or self-aggrandizement? For two men—or one? The ancient Buddhas manifest in countless forms; Zhuangzi’s coffin was split once, twice, thrice. This startled the courage of the Tian clan of old—where now is the Prince of Chu?\n\nMy aspiration is to emulate the Three Recluses: I shall carry only this commentary on the *Daode Jing* and the *Ninefold Layer* chapter, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, their echoes drowning the clouds over the streams. I shall forget my name and age—this is my preface.\n\nWritten by Tianlezi Chen Yuzhao beneath the wondrous winds of Shanshui Mountain\n\n**Volume One: Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures**\nBy Changyi Mountain Recluse Li Hanxu\nCollated by Chen Yingning of Wanjian\n\n**Reader’s Guide to *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures***\n\n1. The author of this work is surnamed Li, named Xiyue, styled Hanxu, and also known as Tuanyang. A native of Leshan, Sichuan, he attained the Dao in the bingchen year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty.\n\n2. In China’s tradition of immortals’ Dao, there were originally two schools: the Southern and Northern. The Southern School began with Zhang Ziyang of Tiantai, Zhejiang, and the Northern School with Wang Chongyang of Zhongnan, Shaanxi. By the Jiajing era of the Ming, Lu Qianxu wrote the *Outer History of Square Pot*, greatly expounding the subtle Daoist winds, and was known as the Eastern School. The author of this work, Li Hanxu, was collectively regarded as the Western School. The Western School’s lineage transmission bears nine characters: *The Western Dao is universal; the great river flows east; the sea and sky are boundless.*\n\n3. Zhang Ziyang received the elixir method from an extraordinary figure in Chengdu but did not disclose his identity. At the same time, Wang Chongxi encountered Liu Haichan, who transmitted the oral formula of the Golden Elixir. Chongxi once remarked that no Daoist in the world could comprehend it except Zhang Pingshu. Thus, Lu Yanfu concluded that Ziyang must have also received transmission from Haichan. Haichan was a disciple of Zhongli Quan, the True Man of Zhengyang, and a fellow student of Lü Zu. Wang Chongyang’s collected works also refer to *\"Zhengyang as ancestor, Pure Yang as master, Haichan as uncle.\"* From this, it is evident that the Southern and Northern Schools share a common origin. Furthermore, Lu Qianxu of the Ming claimed to have met Lü Zu at the Grass Hall by the Northern Sea and personally heard the subtleties of the Dao. Li Hanxu of the Qing also encountered Lü Zu at a Chan monastery on Mount Emei, who secretly imparted the original sound. Thus, the four schools—Southern, Northern, Eastern, and Western—may all be considered transmissions from Lü Zu.\n\n4. The Northern School’s practice emphasizes tranquility. Yet among the Seven Perfected, Liu Zu was renowned for cultivating in brothels, unlike the desolate sitting of the True Man of Everlasting Spring. The Southern School’s oral formulas emphasize yin and yang. Yet among the Five Ancestors, Bai Yuchan was ordained from childhood, wandering as a cloud and water for life, unlike the Chan master Daoguang, who returned to lay life. In expounding Daoist texts, Lu’s works are refined and pure, while Li’s are complex. In explaining the *Human-Primordial Elixir Method*, Lu’s account is simple, while Li’s is intricate. From this, one may see that while the Dao is the same, methods may differ in skill. Though methods may align, oral instructions may vary in simplicity or complexity. It is for the scholar to harmonize and comprehend them, not to impose self-limitation.\n\n5. Zhang Ziyang attained the Dao during the Xining era of Emperor Shenzong of the Song, approximately 830 years before the founding of the Republic. Wang Chongyang attained the Dao during the Dading era of Emperor Shizong of the Jin, approximately 740 years before the Republic. Lu Qianxu attained the Dao during the Longqing era of Emperor Muzong of the Ming, approximately 340 years before the Republic. Li Hanxu attained the Dao during the Xianfeng era of the Qing, approximately 60 years before the Republic.\n\n6. Li Hanxu’s works include *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Supreme*, *Annotations on the Daoist Ballad of the Rootless Tree*, and the compiled and edited *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, all of which have long circulated widely. Only *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* remain unpublished, and even the manuscript of *Inner Chapters of Yuanqiao* has not been seen. Now, *Discourse on the Dao’s Apertures* and *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles* are published first to satisfy the longing of those devoted to the Dao.\n\n7. This book is a hand-copied manuscript from the collection of Mao Fuchu of Fujian, personally brought to Shanghai by Deng Yucang of Liancheng, Fujian, who entrusted its collation and publication to me. The costs of typesetting, printing, binding, and paper were jointly advanced by Deng Yucang and Zhang Zhuming through arrangements with the Alchemical Scripture Engraving Society. Only now can this work meet its readers—Mao, Deng, and Zhang have rendered no small service.\n\n8.

      "translated_text": "The errors herein lie merely in whether the phrasing is coherent or not, not in whether the theories are sound or flawed. The implications are relatively minor, so there is no need to compose a separate collation record, lest it occupy excessive space.\n\n9. At the time, Master Deng urged me to extract the essential points of this book for the benefit of readers. In my humble opinion, terms long customary in alchemical scriptures—such as *li* and *kan*, mercury and lead—are all figurative expressions. They may refer to the heart and kidneys, to spirit and *qi*, or even to male and female; it rests with the reader to delve deeply and grasp their meaning. Were one to insist on equating a given term with a specific entity, opinions would diverge along lines of wisdom and folly, and disputes over right and wrong would never cease. I fear this might inadvertently narrow the book’s scope of application, contravening the original intent of dissemination—better to leave it be.\n\n10. The most illuminating phrase in this book is “the other household.” For instance, Chapter Three states: *“To nourish my own mercury, one must employ the true lead of the other household.”* Chapter Five says: *“In inner refinement of the self, one uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household. In inner cultivation of the self, one likewise uses the lead of the other household to nourish the mercury of my household.”* Chapter Eight declares: *“This lead is not the lead of returning elixir; it is the true fire of the other household.”* Chapter Ten observes: *“When the original root leaks away, essence, *qi*, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek it within oneself, one must seek it in the other.”* Chapter Seventeen notes: *“Original essence resides in my household; true essence resides in the other household.”* Chapter Eighteen states: *“The embodiment of supreme virtue, amply endowed by Heaven, need not seek it in the other household—hence it is called the Heavenly Origin.”* Chapter Twenty-Five says: *“I direct a speck of yin-fire essence to plant within the other household.”* And Chapter Twenty-Nine explains: *“Gathering and refining means gathering the yang lead of the other household to refine the *qi* of the child-pearl in my household.”* From the examples above, the references to “the other household” are indeed thorough. Yet precisely how to interpret these two words remains open to inquiry. If “the other household” refers to the *qi* within the kidneys, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are mistaken. If it refers to the Great Void beyond the body, then those who refine only the spirit in the heart are likewise mistaken. If it refers to a partner of the opposite sex, then solitary practitioners devoted solely to meditation are mistaken. Readers must focus on these profoundly subtle points to truly perceive the Way in all its manifestations.\n\nWritten on the birthday of the Hundred Flowers in the mid-spring of the *dingchou* year of the Republic of China (1937), by Chen Yingning of Wanjiang, at the Abode of Myriad Wonders in Shanghai’s western outskirts.\n\n**Preface by Zhang**\nMy late great-uncle, Master Jingchuan, was fond of cinnabar arts, originally intending only to cultivate *qi* and refine his nature.

Some were printed editions, others hand-copied—countless volumes, all sources of daily delight.

This is my final testament—pray do not forget it!”\n\nThough still a child, I too once heard these words. After my elder brother passed away, my younger brother Zhongkuan aired the books, and some, already gnawed by insects, had gone unnoticed. By chance, I came upon them and intended to make a fresh copy to serve as a future master text. Just as I began, my friend Liu Xuanfu paid a visit. Seeing the books, he asked, “Are you also tending to the Dao?”\n\nI explained my purpose, and he exclaimed, “Excellent! This endeavor of yours. I, too, have long cherished these books, though none have guided me in correcting their errors.

Should anyone study these two books in depth, pondering their subtleties and putting them into practice, the two Patriarchs will surely uplift them in secret, even in this very life. Though they may not attain the rank of Great Golden Immortal, they shall certainly be spared the torments of rebirth.\n\nThose who print and distribute these two books to fellow seekers, illuminating the great path and sparing them from heterodox and demonic ways, shall see their nine generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and their descendants shall never bear offspring of evil or lust.\n\nRespectfully added by Zhang Richang of Meigao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter One: Admonition to Fellow Practitioners**\n\nDeep in the night, seated in meditation—tranquil and natural.\nOn a rope bed or bamboo couch, cross-legged at the fifth watch.\nHaving sat, one rises again, at ease and content.\nThus, what has been attained is recorded by lamplight, and I say to my friends:\n\nWhen the night’s qi is clear and the breath is regulated, the spirit abides.\nIf one regulates as it is regulated, one avoids the pitfall of dull emptiness.\nIf one abides as it abides, one avoids the trap of clinging.\nAt such a time, neither forgetting nor forcing—seeming to forget, seeming to retain.\nSilent yet alert, perfectly round and luminous.\nWater naturally clears, fire naturally arises, spirit naturally merges, qi naturally converges, wind naturally aligns, the cart naturally moves, withdrawal naturally withdraws, advance naturally advances, addition naturally adds, retreat naturally retreats.\nOnly because this wondrous attainment is uniquely grasped does one wield control as if by heart—drowsiness naturally departs, distraction naturally gathers.\nCould anything be more joyous?\n\nYet to shun the lamp and feign sleep—I cannot bear to see it; it rests with your own discipline.\nTo lean on the desk and pretend wakefulness—I dare not partake in it; it rests with your own faith.\nTo close the eyes and indulge in thoughts—I cannot know it; it rests with your own elimination.\nThose who succumb to drowsiness in the clear night are not diligent in this practice.\nThose who fall into distraction in the clear night are not devoted to this practice.\nLacking diligence and devotion, one betrays the profound hopes of the Patriarchs.\nOur Dao is most wondrous and mysterious; those afflicted by such faults must amend them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Two: Dialogue on Opening the Passes**\n\nSeveral friends asked Tuanyangzi:\n“Your discourse on nothingness may be called pure, authentic, and lucid—opening the apertures of the gateway. Yet I do not understand why the Sun Tao school holds that ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ should occur *before* foundation-laying, while Master Qianxu claims the ancient immortals never spoke of it, and now it has arisen. They further say, ‘Adding a snake’s leg is superfluous; a steed’s bones are priceless. The peril of the Great Dao lies in such men.’ Thus, they deem ‘opening the passes and expanding the apertures’ contemptible. Since you share the same teacher, I beg you to explain.”\n\nTuanyangzi replied:\n“Alas! What Master Qianxu spoke of was not contempt, but lament for those unfortunate ones who have lost their primordial purity, compelling them to resort to such minor techniques. The virtue of the lower grade is effortless, not sought through scrutiny. A child whose primordial qi remains unbroken may cultivate purity and attain the immortal embryo without need of return or reversal—why open the passes? Thus, this is deemed a peril to the Great Dao. It is akin to the lament of the Most High: ‘When the Great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness arise.’\n\nYet our generation takes saving others as its merit. Of those who transmit these teachings, how many retain the purity of childhood? Thus, expanding the apertures and opening the passes serve to unlock the mystery and clear the path, while returning to the origin and reverting to the root aid our kind and restore the true body. For those who begin the Dao in middle age, as long as they concentrate the spirit with method, regulate the breath with measure, and when the yin heel qi stirs, draw it into the crucible—neither forgetting nor forcing—then when the postnatal qi arises, they refine it again. The true mechanism will move of itself. Seizing its movement to guide it, one need not force the opening, for the pass opens naturally; one need not force the expansion, for the aperture expands naturally. Once the true qi ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, the path of the River Cart may be traversed. All occurs of itself, naturally.\n\nSeizing the moment between movement and stillness, one gently stokes the fire, driving it past the Tailbone Pass and reversing its flow to the Heavenly Valley. Naturally, essence is refined into qi, irrigating the Three Palaces. Thereafter, having obtained the wondrous medicine from without, one captures and restrains the true qi of the body, causing it to congeal without scattering. Then, in mutual affection and longing, like a dragon nurturing its pearl or a hen brooding her egg, the warmth unbroken, they settle together in the Yellow Court, coalescing into a cinnabar orange—this is called the ‘inner elixir.’ Thus, the work of the first stage is complete, the marvel of longevity attained, and the Way of preserving the form perfected.”",

      "translated_text": "Upon hearing this, the friend rejoiced and said, “Without your words, I would have nearly lost myself in longing. Though we are not quick of wit, we shall withdraw and cultivate accordingly.”\n\n**Chapter Three: An Exegesis on the Postnatal Methods**\n\nOf old, the postnatal methods were divided into only two stages: laying the foundation and refining the self. Yet Master Tao Cuncun further observed, “If a cultivator of the Dao does not first open the passes before hastily speaking of laying the foundation and refining the self, it is like scratching an itch from outside the boot—of no benefit whatsoever.” Thus, he divided the postnatal sequence into four stages: opening the passes, laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine, and refining the self.\n\nFearing that others might harbor doubts, I have composed this to clarify: the ancient division into two stages represents the broad outlines of the postnatal path, while the present division into four stages delineates its finer progression. Opening the passes clears the way for laying the foundation; obtaining the medicine supplies what the foundation requires; and refining the self completes the work of laying the foundation. Though four stages are now distinguished, they remain two in essence, and those two are ultimately one.\n\nAs the ancients said, “Subtle details and fine points cannot be transmitted except by a true teacher, nor spoken of except by a worthy disciple.” Though laying the foundation and refining the self do not belong to the highest alchemy, their finer stages exceed even what Master Tao described. The *Cantong Qi* states, “The inferior virtue practices it without ceasing.” Precisely because it does not cease, one perceives its many stages.\n\nDivergent teachings abound, and differing views arise, but all depend on the practitioner’s capacity for synthesis. The Perfected Sun Jiaoluan said, “Those who cultivate the body must first employ the crucible to open the passes.” He also said, “The crucible is the numinous father and numinous mother.” Why are the numinous father and numinous mother called the crucible? Because the parents who give birth to immortals and buddhas differ from ordinary parents, and so they are named the numinous father and numinous mother of the postnatal crucible.\n\nThe numinous father and numinous mother unite in reverse flow, whereas ordinary parents join in forward motion to sustain life. The method of reverse flow is constant from beginning to end. Once the crucible is established, spirit and qi intermingle, and accumulation deepens. As accumulation deepens, vigor surges. When vigor surges, the passes expand. When the passes expand, the path of reverse circulation opens, and the route of the River Chariot is traversed.\n\nYet moving the River Chariot is not the same as opening the passes. Opening the passes relies on postnatal true qi, while the River Chariot relies on postnatal metal and water. When the work reaches the stage of the River Chariot, the daily tasks of laying the foundation and refining the self become indistinguishable.\n\nQianxu said, “With ceaseless circulation and irrigation, over time it becomes perfectly refined. Qi fills the Three Fields, and above and below harmonize. This is what is meant by ‘constantly allowing qi to surge through and penetrate the joints, naturally filling the valley spirit with essence.’”\n\nI have often called the study of the postnatal path “nurturing the self.” If one carefully examines my words and fathoms its comprehensive stages, the Way of prolonging life and preserving the body will be attained.\n\nWhat is nurturing the self? The *Cantong Qi* states, “Within, nurture the self in tranquil emptiness.” This is the essential teaching of the postnatal path. The self is one’s inherent nature, the primordial spirit. Within refers to the inner realm, the state of emptiness. In emptiness, there is constant tranquility and peace; only when at peace can one deliberate, and only when tranquil can one respond.\n\nYet to still the spirit, one must regulate the breath with measure. One exhalation and one inhalation are called a single breath. It must follow its natural course, yet not be left entirely to its own devices. Zhuangzi said, “The true person breathes from the heels.” The heels signify unbroken continuity, an unceasing, subtle presence. Qi penetrates the Bubbling Spring, flowing without interruption.\n\nMy teacher said, “Let the inner breath follow the outer breath, and the outer breath follow the inner breath, breath after breath following breath after breath.” This is the subtlety of following the heels. When the inner breath exhales, the outer breath inhales; when the inner breath inhales, the outer breath exhales. Inner and outer breaths, reversing and aligning, generate one another. With measured opening and closing, a wondrous spontaneity arises, requiring no forced effort.\n\nThe ancients said, “If one asks how to begin laying the foundation, first understand the mysterious pass of the bellows.” To know the inner breath is to know the bellows. The alchemists say, “Exhale without passing the throat; inhale to return to the root.” This refers to the inner breath. How could mouth and nose breathing prevent it from passing?\n\nOnce the breath is regulated, one must also concentrate the spirit. Concentrating the spirit means remaining utterly still, inwardly illuminating the body. Yet this concentration of spirit and regulation of breath are not two separate practices. Regulating the breath gathers the spirit; gathering the spirit awakens awareness; awakened awareness generates qi; and qi, thus generated, is inwardly gathered and stilled. The golden crucible daily fills, primordial yellow and true lead unite, true qi surges into the heart, and is drawn to the Tailbone Pass. With a single thrust, the Three Passes open, the path of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl is revealed, and the Silver River may be drawn.\n\nYet the Way of nurturing the self is vast indeed. It encompasses regulating the breath, concentrating the spirit, gathering qi, and piercing the passes, while also including the work of laying the foundation and refining the self.\n\nShangyang said, “Treasure essence and enrich qi—this is nurturing the self. Face circumstances without attachment—this is refining the self.” Nurturing the self aids refining the self from within, while refining the self eliminates external distractions to nurturing the self. To refine the self without nurturing the self makes the elixir foundation difficult to complete. To nurture the self without refining the self makes the mercury nature difficult to stabilize. Together, nurturing the self and refining the self are one and the same Way.\n\nYet to nurture one’s own mercury, one must employ the other family’s true lead—the prior-heaven within the postnatal, the metal and water within the postnatal, the state of having qi without form. When true lead first arises, it steams between the two kidneys, and one immediately mobilizes the River Chariot to refine it, ascending from the Tailbone Pass to the Heavenly Valley, pouring sweet dew to return to the Yellow Court, sprinkling and irrigating the Three Palaces, using lead to restrain mercury. When qi transforms into fluid and retreats the yin tally, the flowing pearl no longer escapes.",

      "translated_text": "When fluid transforms into qi and advances the yang fire, the River Chariot rises once more.\n\nMoreover, refining one’s nature and cultivating the mind, externally eliminating worldly distractions, dwelling concealed amidst the marketplace, harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar—thus both body and mind become settled, and the inner mercury solidifies. Only then may one seek the eight ounces of prior-heaven to pair with the half-catty of postnatal, and the Reverted Elixir may be attained.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Four: Laying the Foundation and Refining the Self**\n\nLaying the foundation and refining the self—these two are one. Yet there are minor and major foundations, external and internal refinement of the self. One must not be ignorant of this.\n\nWhat is the minor foundation? Drawing primordial yang into the inner crucible, sustaining embryonic breathing, then generating the postnatal medicine and performing the jade refinement. This is what the Sun Tao school calls \"once the foundation is laid, one dares to obtain the medicine; once the inner medicine congeals, one dares to refine the self.\"\n\nWhat is the major foundation? Nurturing the spirit pearl to produce external lead, with metal and water flowing abundantly, diligently practicing the marvels of the Celestial Cycle to complete the work of perfecting one’s nature. This is what the *Collected Explanations* refers to as \"opening the passes to pave the foundation’s path, obtaining the medicine to supply the foundation’s needs, and refining the self to conclude the foundation’s work.\"\n\nInternal refinement of the self concerns the work of the River Chariot and the jade fluid’s efficacy—this is the *Can Tong Qi*’s discourse on \"internally nurturing the self.\" External refinement of the self means all phenomena are empty, not a speck of dust clings—this is the ancient teaching of \"forgetting emotions when facing circumstances.\"\n\nIn essence, internal refinement is the major foundation, and the major foundation is nurturing the self. Nurturing the self still aids internal refinement, and internal refinement still requires external refinement. All elixir scriptures interweave the three and five, their words differing but their substance the same. Thus I say: laying the foundation and refining the self are one and two. May scholars skillfully comprehend this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Five: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**\n\nI previously stated that nurturing the self is the internal aid to refining the self, while refining the self removes the external disturbances to nurturing the self. This was provisionally distinguished for clarity, not to imply they are unrelated.\n\nYet there are indeed differences. External refinement of the self begins with refining in the face of circumstances, which differs from internal refinement and even from external nurturing of the self. Why? External refinement of the self refines the heart-mind to stabilize it. When the heart-mind is settled, the body is settled; when the body is settled, sensual desires cannot sway it, nor can wealth and profit dazzle it. Only then can true mercury be preserved, and the elixir’s foundation secured.\n\nAs for internal refinement of the self, it shares similarities with internal nurturing of the self. In elixir scriptures, refining the self means smelting mercury into cinnabar. Master Tao says: \"Refining the self is not mere empty refinement.\" Shangyang says: \"Cultivating the elixir is easy; refining the self is most difficult.\" The self here refers to the true fire of one’s mercury. One must first refine this true fire, subdue this true dragon, and command it at will, preventing it from bolting—only then can one subjugate the white tiger and obtain the true gold of the supreme treasure. Thus refining the self originally involves effort.\n\nThis effortful refinement of the self is internal refinement of the self, which is also internal nurturing of the self. Internal refinement of the self uses the other family’s lead to refine one’s own mercury, causing them to restrain and generate each other. Internal nurturing of the self also employs the other family’s lead to nurture one’s own mercury, enabling them to support and guard each other. Hence their shared meaning.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Six: Nurturing the Self and Refining the Self**\n*(This chapter transmits the oral teachings of the Western School, renaming \"laying the foundation\" as \"nurturing the self\"—though the name differs, the principle remains the same.)*\n\nNurturing the self and refining the self form a continuous practice. Nurturing the self means treasuring essence and enriching qi—this is laying the foundation. Refining the self means forgetting emotions when facing circumstances—this is completing one’s nature.\n\nMust refining the self precede nurturing the self, or does nurturing the self first supply refinement? When essence and qi are cultivated, the earth of the self grows ever more solid and thick—hence the character *foundation* (基) is derived from earth (土). Thus laying the foundation is nurturing the self. When emotions and circumstances are tempered, the heart-mind of the self grows ever clearer and undying—hence the character *nature* (性) is derived from heart (心). Thus completing one’s nature must begin with refining the self.\n\nThough nurturing the self requires essence and qi, essence is guarded internally while qi comes from without. To strengthen one’s guard, one must employ the self; to await its arrival, one must employ the self. The Way of nurturing the self thus demands tranquility as its work.\n\nI distinguish two paths for nurturing the self: self-nurturing and mutual nurturing. Mutual nurturing pertains to essence and qi; self-nurturing pertains to tranquility.\n\nThough refining the self occurs amidst emotions and circumstances, emotions are inwardly attenuated while circumstances are outwardly emptied. When one is naturally content, the self must have something to delight in; when one is unburdened, the self must have something to uphold. The Way of refining the self thus demands both movement and stillness.\n\nI distinguish two aspects of refining the self: internal refinement and external refinement. External refinement is harmonizing one’s light with the vulgar; internal refinement is smelting mercury into cinnabar.\n\nA gatha says:\n*To know the true path of cultivation,*\n*First practice these two endeavors.*\n*Clarifying nurturing and refining the self,*\n*Helps one better read the immortal scriptures.*\n\nThe *Scripture* states: \"The inner heart should be alive; the outer heart should be dead.\" To enliven the inner heart, one must internally nurture the self. To extinguish the outer heart, one must externally refine the self. This is how I elucidate internal nurturing and external refinement of the self.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Postnatal Sequence**\n\nAfter the initial foundation, the postnatal serves as the marvelous function. Yet there is a postnatal that can be used, and one that cannot. The unusable postnatal does not even deserve the name—being utterly yin and turbid, it is unworthy of mention. Here, I discuss only the usable postnatal in sequence:\n\nFirst, the postnatal;\nSecond, the prior-heaven within the postnatal;\nThird, the prior-heaven;\nFourth, the prior-heaven within the prior-heaven.",

      "translated_text": "The postnatal is the qi of the Yin Heel Vessel, the root of human life, which, when first stirred, becomes primordial essence. The practitioner strikes the bamboo to summon it, drawing it into the inner crucible, where it naturally refines essence into qi and opens the passes. This qi surges through the five viscera, suffuses the hundred bones, coils through the meridians, and returns to the Cinnabar Field. With concentrated spirit and regulated breath, one awaits the movement of the mechanism. When the mechanism stirs and the flute sounds, a single thread ascends—this is the prior-heaven within the postnatal. It is gathered with the sword, tuned with the zither, circulated with the River Chariot, and sealed in the Yellow Court—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid. With long and thorough practice, body and mind become steadfast; only then does one enter the chamber and approach the furnace to seek the prior-heaven. This prior-heaven is the primordial ancestral qi. First, one establishes the furnace and crucible by setting the true yin and true yang—kindred, sentient substances—each weighing eight ounces. Using the true qi of this furnace and crucible as a dharmic image, one revolves it through the celestial cycles to lure out the prior-heaven and immediately seize it. In less than half a quarter-hour, it coalesces into a single grain, adhering to the crucible—this is the lead mother, called the external elixir. The prior-heaven within the prior-heaven is so named because yang is born within lead, and the curtain’s light shines through. One gathers this most true yang qi to capture and subdue the essence-qi of one’s own body—this is what is meant by “When gold returns to the original nature, it is then called the Returned Elixir.” Thereafter, one nurtures and stabilizes it, daily revolving the yin tally and yang fire. By nurturing and fostering it, it transforms into the substance of golden liquid. Swallowing it into the five viscera is called the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir. After ingestion, it coalesces into the sacred embryo. With ten months of work complete, the yang spirit manifests. Beyond the reach of the five phases, one is titled a true immortal. To further ascend, one faces the wall for nine years—this is called refining the spirit to return to emptiness. Facing the wall means that within the moment, a ten-thousand-fathom cliff stands before one, untouched by worldly dust—it is not merely sitting facing a wall. The nine years refer to the nine revolutions. With the work of nine revolutions deepened, one attains a hundred million transformation bodies.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Inner and Outer Medicines**\n\nThe inner medicine serves to complete one’s nature; the outer medicine is needed to complete one’s destiny. For the practitioner to fulfill nature and destiny, one must first cultivate the inner medicine and then the outer medicine. This inner medicine is half a catty of mercury; this outer medicine is eight ounces of lead. One must first gather the outer medicine to capture the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the kidneys; this inner medicine is the essence of the heart. The postnatal work concludes here. As for establishing nature and destiny, one must first rely on the inner medicine to plant the outer medicine. This inner medicine is mercury within cinnabar; this outer medicine is lead within water. One must first refine the outer medicine and then the inner medicine. This outer medicine is the qi of the elixir mother; this inner medicine is the sacred embryo. The prior-heaven work concludes here. Yet one must understand the dual use of inner and outer: which is the medicine, and which is the elixir? The inner elixir is true mercury, the earth of the self, which returns to the gate of *li*; with time, it is refined into wondrous cinnabar. The outer elixir is true lead, the earth of *wu*, concealed in the door of *kan*; with time, it manifests as beautiful golden blossoms. To congeal the inner elixir, one must first use lead to restrain mercury—this lead is not the lead of the Returned Elixir but the true fire of the other household. To refine the outer elixir, one must first use mercury to welcome lead—this lead is not the lead of the congealed elixir but the one qi of the prior-heaven. Thus, congealing the elixir differs from returning the elixir. Congealing means coagulation: taking the qi of the other household to coagulate the qi of one’s own household. The transformation occurs within the postnatal crucible, inseparable from the celestial fire-tending, and only then can one succeed. Returning means restoration: gathering the gold of *dui* to restore the gold of *qian*. The transformation occurs within the prior-heaven crucible, requiring the union of kindred yin and yang to achieve completion. Congealing the elixir completes the inner elixir; returning the elixir employs the outer elixir. The inner elixir is the yin elixir—mercury is originally yin within yang. The outer elixir is the yang elixir—lead is yang within yin. The earthly origin is the outer elixir, whose salvific and bestowing functions are all directed toward others. The human origin is the inner elixir, whose principles of nature and destiny are all directed toward the self. There is more one must know: the inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet the Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is also called the inner medicine because its transformation occurs within. The outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet the Golden Elixir is also called the outer medicine because its transformation occurs without. This is the great elixir that encompasses both inner and outer. There is also what one must know: the outer elixir is the outer medicine, yet there is an outer medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When the great *kan* and *li* intersect, the River Chariot revolves, transforming qi into liquid, which descends to the Yellow Chamber—this is also called the outer medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. The inner elixir is the inner medicine, yet there is an inner medicine that has not yet become an elixir. When one establishes the prior-heaven foundation, the Crimson Palace transforms liquid, which flows back to the primordial sea, and the liquid reverts to qi—this is also called the inner medicine, though it has not yet become an elixir. This is the work of purity and quiescence that encompasses both inner and outer. The distinctions between elixirs and medicines are fully recorded here for the learner’s benefit.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Nine: The Resemblance of Medicinal Substances**\n\nIn the teachings of the prior-heaven and postnatal, the medicinal substances have layers that closely resemble one another, differing only in scale. Now, I will discuss those that resemble each other. The postnatal *kan* and *li* serve to lay the foundation of the elixir; the prior-heaven *kan* and *li* serve to establish the foundation of the elixir. The postnatal lead and mercury serve to congeal the minor elixir; the prior-heaven lead and mercury serve to return the great elixir. Three years of refining the self serve to complete one’s nature; nine years of facing the wall serve to complete one’s destiny. The postnatal *kan* and *li* refer to the union of original spirit and original qi to lay the foundation of the elixir, generating the minor medicine. The prior-heaven *kan* and *li* refer to the union of true yin and true yang to establish the foundation of the elixir (that is, the elixir mother), generating the great medicine.",

      "translated_text": "Postnatal lead and mercury refer to the golden crucible refining the generated medicine—this medicine is external lead. The river chariot transports and restrains the flowing pearl—the flowing pearl is internal mercury. When lead and mercury constrain each other, the minor elixir is congealed. Prior-heaven lead and mercury refer to the union of like yin and yang to form *wu* earth—*wu* earth is external lead. Harmonizing the fire timing with *ji* earth—*ji* earth is internal mercury. When lead and mercury meet, the great elixir returns. During the refinement of the minor elixir, the abdomen feels warm and intoxicated. Then, borrowing the *zi-wu* cycle, one gradually gathers and congeals, causing lead to subdue mercury, forming yin cinnabar. After the great elixir congeals, the furnace glows with enduring redness. Then, borrowing the external furnace’s talismanic fire, diligently increasing and decreasing, one causes lead to dry and mercury to manifest, forming yang cinnabar.\n\nRefining the self to complete one’s nature means nurturing yin cinnabar. Internally, one treasures essence and enriches qi; externally, one faces the mirror and forgets emotion—thus both body and mind are firmly established. \"Three years\" signifies the meaning of \"three months without deviation.\" Facing the wall to complete one’s destiny means nurturing yang cinnabar. One must ensure both form and spirit are wondrous, truly shattering the void—thus transformations become boundless. \"Nine years\" signifies the meaning of the \"ninefold great return.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten: Mutual Nourishment of the Three Treasures**\nThe *Xinyin Jing* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" These are the supreme treasures of cultivation. Their ceaseless generation and transformation mutually nourish one another—this is elucidated for the scholar. Practicing the Dao of reverse cultivation transforms essence into qi, and qi into spirit. Practicing the Dao of sequential cultivation generates spirit from qi, and qi from essence.\n\nOne asks: Why reverse refinement? Since the original root leaks, essence, qi, and spirit all fall into the postnatal. If one cannot seek them within, one must seek them without. Seeking them without is reverse refinement. Essence transforming into qi means this essence, residing in the yin heel vessel, reversely enters the purple palace to be refined—thus it transforms into qi. Qi transforming into spirit means this qi, residing in the yang furnace, reversely enters the yellow court to be refined—thus it transforms into spirit.\n\nThough this reverse refinement begins with essence, the sequential refinement begins with spirit. The two have a mutual necessity and do not conflict. To reverse-refine original essence, one must first concentrate the spirit. When spirit is concentrated, qi gathers; when qi gathers, essence is generated. For when spirit and qi unite, they naturally produce celestial essence. This essence is the water of the celestial one, *ren* in *kan*, also called mother qi or external essence. The practitioner uses mother qi to cultivate child qi, and external essence to replenish internal essence—this is the work of like kind. Child qi is heart qi. Internal essence is heart essence. Postnatal cultivation proceeds from external to internal, so one must first refine the external medicine to return to the internal medicine.\n\nThere is also the principle of spirit transforming into essence, and essence into qi. This refers to the crimson palace transforming fluid, which flows back to the original sea, the fluid then transforming into qi, later transported by the river chariot. There is further the principle of qi generating essence, and essence generating spirit. This refers to white clouds ascending to court, sweet dew descending, drawing out the yang of *kan* to replenish the yin of *li*.\n\nExcellent indeed! The words of Immortal Tao: \"Knowing the internal but not the external, one cannot open the passes. Gathering the external but not the internal, one cannot secure the root.\" Those who embody this understand the wondrous mutual nourishment of essence, qi, and spirit.\n\n**Chapter Eleven: The Five Passes of Refining Practice**\nElixir methods divide into three passes: refining essence, refining qi, and refining spirit. Yet the depths of cultivation truly exceed these three. If the stages are incomplete, one risks skipping levels. Let us now discuss them.\n\nThe first pass refines essence, requiring the crucible. One unites original yellow to copulate, transforming the golden crow to ascend—thus essence transforms into qi. The second pass refines qi, requiring clarity on *zi-wu*. One draws out the yang within *kan* to replenish the yin within *li*—thus qi transforms into spirit. Both foundation-laying and elixir-returning employ such methods, differing only in the scale of medicine, crucible, and furnace.\n\nAs for the Dao of refining spirit, there are three passes: first, refining spirit to complete one’s nature; second, refining spirit to complete one’s destiny; third, refining spirit to return to emptiness. Refining spirit to complete one’s nature is the Dao of refining the self with jade fluid. Lead subdues mercury, congealing the elixir foundation. Internally, true fire is unceasing; externally, the *zi-wu* cycle gathers and congeals. Thus mercury is refined into yin cinnabar. Refining spirit to complete one’s destiny is the Dao of refining form with golden fluid. Lead returns to restrain mercury, congealing the fetal infant. Internally, true fire glows enduringly; externally, yin and yang are applied, daily increasing and decreasing. Thus mercury is dried into yang cinnabar.\n\nRefining spirit to return to emptiness ascends further, uniting with the Dao in truth. One moves the spirit to the upper courtyard, sits upright with a tranquil mind, directly merging with the great void to universally illuminate the great thousand worlds. Thus the Dharma body is perfected, the śarīra radiates light, and emanations respond boundlessly. As the saying goes: \"Children and grandchildren, a hundred thousand myriad transformations.\" At this stage, responding to the moment to establish merit, the body returns to the Three Purities, and the Dao transcends the nine ancestors.\n\n**Chapter Twelve: The Stages of Medicine Production**\nMedicines have three stages: first, emerging from non-being into being; next, entering from being into non-being; finally, producing being from non-being.\n\nEmerging from non-being into being refers to postnatal lead fire. Though generated externally, it is formless and without substance—this is the initial arising of golden qi. Entering from being into non-being refers to sending it to the western region.",

When the work of nurturing is complete, it becomes the sage—this is the moment when the great man’s merit is accomplished and his name established.\n\nSomeone asked Tuanyang: “Master Shangyang said, ‘The internal medicine completes nature to congeal the elixir; the external medicine completes life to return the elixir.’ Thus, disciples should first refine the internal medicine before proceeding to the external. Why then does Yingchanzi claim that ‘one must begin with the external medicine before turning to the internal’?”\n\nTuanyang replied: “You conflate the postcelestial external medicine with the precelestial external medicine, regarding both simply as ‘external medicine.’ Yet the postcelestial external medicine precedes *gui*, while the precelestial external medicine follows *gui*. Though their names are the same, their realities differ. Clinging to the letter and fixating on appearances—this is the common flaw of those who lack the master’s oral transmission.”",

      "translated_text": "Thus, I set forth this three-tiered exposition to elucidate the matter.\n\n**Chapter Fourteen: The Two Kinds of Cinnabar**\n\nIn the study of the postcelestial, one governs mercury with lead to form cinnabar. This cinnabar is the treasure of the sevenfold return, utterly pure and flawless—the Lesser Returned Elixir.\n\nIn the study of the precelestial, one extracts lead to augment mercury, forming cinnabar. This cinnabar is the supreme treasure of the ninefold transmutation, its golden radiance enfolding the body—the Greater Returned Elixir.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Spirit and Qi, Nature and Life**\n\nThe postcelestial Dao pertains to spirit and qi. The precelestial Dao pertains to nature and life. Though nature and life resemble spirit and qi, they are in truth far removed. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* states: “It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor.” These words merit deep reflection.\n\nDisciples who grasp this distinction should complete the postcelestial with spirit and qi, and complete the precelestial with nature and life. Why is this? That which nature commands is called life—these two are originally one. This is the heart-method of establishing life.\n\nThe *Awakening to Reality* says: “Different names arise from the same source, yet few know this; both are profoundly profound, the essential mechanism.” Here, life is the differing name, while nature is the shared source. Lead is the differing name, while mercury is the shared source. Thus, the lead of the watery realm is but a single flavor. This single flavor—lead—originates from the single flavor of mercury.\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: “Through non-desire, observe its mystery; through desire, observe its aperture.” Observing mystery and observing aperture—this is the profoundly profound mechanism. One should attain utmost stillness and desirelessness to observe its mystery, which is the work of stabilizing nature. Yet when the time arrives and the mechanism stirs, the primordial True Unity qi emerges from emptiness—indeed, there is an aperture.\n\nThough these two bear different names, both originate from the Supreme Ultimate, which is their shared source. By observing the non-being, one attains the mystery, gaining one profundity. By observing the being, one attains the aperture, gaining another profundity. Profound beyond profundity—nature resides herein, and life resides herein.\n\nNature originates from Heaven’s mandate, while life originates from the fulfillment of nature. Heaven forms things through qi, yet principle is also bestowed. Thus, mandate is conferred upon human nature, hence it is said: “What Heaven confers is called nature.” Humans create things through principle, and qi begins to arise. Thus, life is established through nature, hence it is said: “Fulfill nature to attain life.”\n\nIn Heaven, principle emerges from qi; in the Dao, qi emerges from principle. When principle emerges from qi, qi is prioritized. This qi is the harmonious, transforming qi of primordial chaos. Humans receive this qi to form their bodies, after which principle has a dwelling—thus, this qi is to be prized.\n\nWhen qi emerges from principle, qi is again prioritized. This qi is the primordial True Unity qi. Yin receives the yang radiance, and within the lead seed, another yang arises—thus, this qi is even more prized. The Dao of the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir cannot be accomplished without this single lead qi; those who recognize this treasure it.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Direct Pointers to the Precelestial**\n\nThe precelestial transcends the postcelestial, being the most primordial and original, the root and the source—it is the venerable designation of the singular qi. Yet this precelestial qi has three aspects, and the term “precelestial” has two meanings.\n\nWhat are these two meanings? The first precedes Heaven. The second originates from Heaven.\n\nThat which precedes Heaven is earlier than Heaven, the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth. This qi encompasses the form of primordial chaos, initially called Supreme Non-Being. Before Heaven and Earth divided, this qi already existed. This is its precedence over Heaven—hence, it is called precelestial. This is the first aspect.\n\nThat which originates from Heaven arises from Heaven, the precelestial that generates humans and all things. This qi contains the image of harmonious fusion, latent within the Great Void. Before humans and things were produced, this qi already existed. This is its origination from Heaven—it is also called precelestial. This is the second aspect.\n\nAs for the precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas, it encompasses both preceding meanings. This qi emerges from emptiness, called the Supreme Unity. The Golden Elixir relies upon it to be completed—termed the Ancestor, the Origin, the Embracer of Reality. It may be likened to the precelestial that precedes Heaven and the precelestial that originates from Heaven, forming three corresponding aspects. Thus, it is also designated as precelestial.\n\nThe elixir scriptures of past sages, whether speaking of the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth or the precelestial that generates humans and things, are without exception metaphors for this precelestial that generates immortals and buddhas.\n\nShould one inquire about the precelestial that generates Heaven and Earth, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is born of the Supreme Ultimate. As the *Classic* states: “There is a thing, chaotically formed, born before Heaven and Earth. Nameless, it is forcibly called the Dao.” It is the ancestor of all phenomena, the origin of the two great powers—without form, without shape, without sound, without scent. Initially, it is profoundly obscure, beyond the reach of the Five Agents. Yet again, it is faintly discernible, the qi arising naturally. When clarity and turbidity separate, and the Dark and Yellow distinguish themselves, then Qian and Kun settle into position, and Heaven and Earth become manifest.\n\nShould one inquire about the precelestial that generates humans and things, Tuanyang replies: This precelestial is governed by Heaven and Earth. One becomes three, and three become one. The one is qi; the three are essence, qi, and spirit. All living beings are forged through these three-in-one.\n\nIn speaking of essence, it is the essence of the Two and Five. In speaking of qi, it is the qi of yin and yang. In speaking of spirit, it is the spirit of emptiness. The spirit of emptiness interacts with the qi of yin and yang. The essence of the Two and Five is co-generated with the qi of yin and yang. Its qi is numinous—hence, it is spirit. Its qi is wondrous—hence, it is essence.",

      "translated_text": "Above coiling and below bounding—this is qi, and within it lies the spirit and essence of Heaven and Earth. Humans receive this qi to be born, which is then called the primordial qi of Heaven. Yet this qi may be clear or turbid, firm or yielding. Those who receive the firm become male; those who receive the yielding become female. Those who receive the clear become wise; those who receive the turbid become dull.\n\nBefore father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. As essence and blood intermingle and the embryo is fully formed, this qi already pervades the womb in undifferentiated unity. At this time, there is no spirit—qi serves as spirit. At this time, there is no essence—qi serves as essence. When qi is concentrated and securely contained, it is essence.\n\nThis is the primordial qi, primordial essence, and primordial spirit—the precelestial endowment for human birth. If a youth encounters a master and receives the method, preserving this purity through cultivation, they may aspire to become a Daoist immortal of non-action.\n\nThere is also true qi, true spirit, and true essence—the precelestial foundation for internal alchemy. If scholars fail to recognize the true mechanism, they will have no starting point and cannot attain this supreme treasure.\n\nNow, the precelestial: it cannot be used when seen, and cannot be seen when used. It is what alchemists seek through emptiness and stillness, refining the real by means of the provisional, generating being from non-being. At this stage, the Way of three, two, and one naturally divides and unites.\n\nSpirit becomes the spirit beyond spirit; essence becomes the essence of utmost essence; qi becomes the true unity of qi—these are the three. The spirit beyond spirit is spirit in its most spiritual form—this is the nature of the Dragon. The essence of utmost essence is essence refined to its purest—this is the essence of the Tiger. These are the two. As for the true unity of qi, it is the true lead for completing life, uniting the Dragon and Tiger’s nature and temperament into one, called the Mother of the Elixir—this is the one.\n\nIngesting this true unity causes the Three Corpses and Five Thieves to flee, filling the six palaces of the body with eternal spring. How could this compare to the qi, essence, and spirit of birth? How could it be approached by the postcelestial qi, essence, and spirit?\n\nThe postcelestial consists of the qi of breathing, the spirit of thought, and the essence of intercourse—three things that can be heard, seen, measured, and inferred. These serve the body after birth, hence they are called postcelestial.\n\nWhen a person is in the womb, there is only a single point of primordial qi, with no qi of breathing. Only after ten months, when the fetus is complete and leaves the mother’s body, does it borrow the orifices of mouth and nose to externally absorb the harmony of Heaven and Earth—thus the origin of breathing qi. From this, the spirit of thought also arises, relying on this qi to enter. It lodges in the body as a temporary abode, seizing the dwelling to reside within. This spirit is the seed of karmic rebirth, arriving first at birth and departing first at death, ceaselessly abandoning the old and seeking the new.\n\nWhen an infant first emerges, its initial cry subtly reveals the suffering of rebirth. As it is nurtured and grows, the acquired spirit takes control, emotions and desires entangle, and the primordial qi gradually dissipates. Even the qi of breathing never ceases for a moment—how tragic!\n\nAs for postcelestial essence, it is not brought at birth nor taken at death. Only as the body’s primordial qi gradually fills and overflows, reaching fifteen years of age, does yang reach its peak and yin begin to grow, yin lengthening as yang wanes. This causes the undifferentiated qi to transform into the passions of intercourse. Intercourse involves both union and sensation—with union and sensation, there is essence; without them, there is none. This essence is compelled by desire and transformed from qi and blood.\n\nThere are also those who lose essence through dream-induced sensations or dream intercourse, which occurs when qi and blood are unstable and the kidney’s gate cannot retain it. This is the essence of intercourse.\n\nI urge those who study the Dao to seek only the precelestial and not the postcelestial, so that the supreme medicine may be obtained. Even if one does not dare to immediately pursue the highest grade but instead builds the foundation and refines the self, one must refine primordial essence into primordial qi, and primordial qi into true lead, making the postcelestial precelestial to complete the half-pound of postcelestial substance. Then one may seek this supreme precelestial.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen: On Spirit, Qi, and Essence**\n\nThe *Heart Seal Scripture* states: \"The three superior medicines are spirit, qi, and essence.\" These are the wondrous substances of internal alchemy. The most exalted among them are primordial spirit, primordial qi, and primordial essence—true essence, true qi, and true spirit.\n\nWhat is primordial? The precelestial. What is true? Also the precelestial. The primordial precelestial is born of the imperial descent—this is the celestial primordial of youth. The true precelestial is accomplished through the great Dao—this is the human primordial of our kind.\n\nIf one cannot cultivate the celestial primordial, must they not rely on the human primordial?\n\nSome may ask: \"The celestial primordial is how Heaven and Earth, through yin-yang and the Five Phases, transform and generate beings, forming shapes with qi and endowing them with principle. The qi that gives life to humans is primordial qi. Before father and mother unite, this qi abides in profound stillness. When father and mother engage in union, this qi descends to its inception. The Confucians speak of 'Heaven giving birth to the multitudes, with things and patterns'—this refers to it. This qi is most numinous; being numinous, it has spirit, which is primordial spirit. This qi is most clear; being clear, it is utmost essence, which is primordial essence.\n\nBefore the embryo is formed, there is only primordial qi within, with no postcelestial breathing qi. Only after ten months, when the form is complete and the mouth and nose exist, does it follow the mother’s breathing to externally absorb the great harmony of Heaven and Earth. The karmic yin spirit also relies on this breathing to enter. Thus, the postcelestial spirit and qi are both complete, and the infant immediately cries upon birth. Fortunately, the mouth cannot speak, the eyes cannot smile, and there is no knowledge or perception. The primordial qi remains undifferentiated, without thought or deliberation, rendering the yin spirit useless.\"",

Thus, after following the natural course of human life, the method of reversing birth to become an immortal is emphasized. This is the great Dao of the human primordial—how it nurtures all things without omission, encompassing Heaven and Earth without overstepping.\n\nThe key lies in recognizing this essence, qi, and spirit.\n\nSomeone asks: \"What is the difference between primordial spirit and true spirit?\"\nAnswer: The primordial spirit is turbid and indistinct. The true spirit is bright and luminous. One lies hidden in chaos, without light; the other, refined through tempering, becomes useful. Confucians speak of \"tranquility, stability, and the ability to contemplate\"; Buddhists, of \"entering deeply into the great prajñā\"; Daoists, of \"supreme stillness generating wisdom.\" This true spirit is perfect knowing and perfect awareness. Thus, even children may cultivate purity, while ordinary people must engage in quiet refinement to attain the true spirit of the perfected.\n\nAnother asks: \"What is the difference between primordial essence and true essence?\"\nAnswer: Primordial essence resides in my domain; true essence resides in the other’s domain. That in my domain is the undifferentiated qi of the Crimson Palace, accumulated over time to generate numinous fluid. That in the other’s domain is the vigorous qi of the Flowery Pond, what the *Awakening to Reality* calls the \"primary essence.\" On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, when metal qi is full and water’s tide arises, it precisely aligns with the true signal of the two equinoxes. If cultivators recognize this essence, drawing it in with a single breath, they may instantly attain celestial immortality—it is no ordinary thing.\n\nAnother asks: \"What is the difference between primordial qi and true qi?\"\nAnswer: Primordial qi is what children receive from Heaven—what is called the qi that forms the body, increasing with the years. True qi, however, is not like this. The primordial, original ancestor arises from within emptiness and nonbeing. Only with the oral instructions of a true teacher, first establishing the cauldron and vessel of qian and kun, harmonizing the true dragon and true tiger, and uniting true yin and true yang, does it coalesce into the mother of lead in half a double-hour. Yang born within lead becomes true qi. Thus, Heaven uses primordial qi to generate humans and things, while the Dao uses true qi to generate immortals and buddhas. The human primordial method of refining qi seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth—no easy feat.\n\nUpon hearing Master Tuanyang’s discourse on the human primordial’s refinement of qi to seize Heaven and Earth’s creative transformation, someone asks about the difference between the celestial primordial and the human primordial. Tuanyang replies: Listen, and I will tell you. \"What Heaven commands is called nature\"—principle emerges from qi: this is the celestial primordial. \"Fully realizing nature to reach destiny\"—qi emerges from principle: this is the human primordial. Supreme virtue is effortless, not seeking through observation, a practice of purity and stillness—this is the celestial primordial. Inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing, the path of return—this is the human primordial. Those of supreme virtue receive Heaven’s bounty in abundance, yet still engage in pure cultivation. They must refine primordial qi and primordial spirit into utmost clarity and emptiness, transforming them into perfect equanimity and perfect awakening, only then fully realizing the principle of the celestial primordial. Thus, the celestial primordial is not a ready-made matter for those of supreme virtue. Those who take supreme virtue as the celestial primordial do so because their original self remains unharmed, naturally close to the celestial primordial.\n\nThose of inferior virtue are the most numerous among people, so the wondrous truth of return is taught first. They must forge yin elixir and yang elixir into a single mass, refining them into supreme nonbeing and supreme emptiness, only then fully realizing the Dao of the human primordial. Thus, the human primordial is not the ready-made body of inferior virtue. Those who take inferior virtue as the human primordial do so because their own and others’ brilliance is manifest, hence it is called the art of the human primordial.\n\nThe original body of supreme virtue is endowed with both nature and destiny. The wondrous function of inferior virtue fully realizes both nature and destiny. Yet both rely on a single qi for transformation. Thus, humans attain the primordial true unity of qi to become immortals, just as Heaven bestows yin-yang and five-phase qi to become human. The elixir path seizes the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth because it is one with the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen: Further Discussion on Essence, Qi, and Spirit**\n\nIn the original body of supreme virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all called \"primordial,\" for what is received from Heaven is abundant, and there is no need to seek from the other’s domain—hence it is called the celestial primordial. In the practice of inferior virtue, essence, qi, and spirit are all named \"true,\" for what is taken from humanity is plentiful, and it cannot be sought from one’s own domain—hence it is called the human primordial. Yet in this human primordial practice, there are wondrous subtleties of gathering the primordial and secret mechanisms of seeking the primordial. Thus, those who use humanity to return to Heaven gather primordial essence to supplement primordial qi, refine primordial qi to nourish primordial spirit, and refine primordial spirit to become true spirit—then the postcelestial work is complete. Using true spirit to generate true qi, using true qi to seek true essence, seizing true essence to form true lead—then the primordial work is complete. When one returns to the origin and embraces the primordial to guard the One, it becomes entirely identical to the practice of supreme virtue.\n\nThose who cultivate inferior virtue but do not reach the realm of nonaction, or embrace supreme virtue but do not investigate the mystery of nonaction, cannot ingest the celestial primordial or attain the rank of celestial immortal.",

The karmic yin spirit also relies on this breathing to enter. Thus, the postcelestial spirit and qi are both complete, and the infant immediately cries upon birth. Fortunately, the mouth cannot speak, the eyes cannot smile, and there is no knowledge or perception. The primordial qi remains undifferentiated, without thought or deliberation, rendering the yin spirit useless.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Nineteen: The Order and Reversal of Nature and Life**\nThe principles of nature and life possess both order and reversal. The ordered completion of nature and life is bestowed by Heaven, wherein one encompasses two. The reversed completion of nature and life is cultivated by man, wherein one unites two. That which encompasses two—qi is endowed with principle, and when qi and principle merge, nature and life become wholly integrated. That which unites two—water is raised to extinguish fire, and when water and fire interact, nature and life endure forever.\n\nWhat Heaven commands is called nature; within life resides nature—this is ordered completion. Mencius spoke of form and appearance as Heaven’s nature, for what is commanded possesses this form, and thus possesses this nature. Innate knowledge and innate ability are both lodged within the commanded form. To fully realize nature is to reach life; within nature, life is cultivated—this is reversed completion. The perfected person plants the life-treasure with the fire of spirit, for what is realized in nature possesses this spirit, and thus possesses this life. In response to stimuli and summons, all arises from the radiance of the spirit within nature.\n\nNow we know that supreme virtue is pure and still, preserving the way of ordered completion to congeal the immortal embryo—this is Heaven perfecting man. We also know that inferior virtue returns and refines the way of reversed completion to congeal the sage embryo—this is exhausting man to unite with Heaven. Let those who study the Dao understand this.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty: The Mysterious Pass of the One Aperture**\nThe mysterious pass of the one aperture is born from emptiness and nothingness. It does not reside among the five viscera or six bowels, nor anywhere in the limbs. Speaking of its name: this pass is a wondrous mechanism, hence it is called the *mysterious pass*. This aperture is the place where all methods return to the One, solitary and without counterpart, hence it is called the *one aperture*. In a single phrase to encompass it: it is the *center*.\n\nThe center lies between above and below, yet it does not lie between above and below—for it is both dead and alive. What is dead? To take the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field as this center is dead. What is alive? To concentrate spirit and gather qi, revealing this center, is alive. In dead terms, it is called the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. In living terms, it is reckoned as the mysterious pass of the one aperture. Thus it is said: born from emptiness and nothingness. The true mechanism is directly revealed. Those who attain it must keep it secret.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One: Further Discussion of the Mysterious Pass**\nThe mysterious pass is the numinous radiance where spirit and qi unite. When first glimpsed, the mysterious pass flickers without constancy. When first entered, it is indistinct and without support, for spirit and qi have only just merged and cannot yet solidify. Only when their embrace becomes pure and familiar, and the heart dies without departing, does one begin to recognize that within the mysterious pass, self and other are forgotten, and even spirits and gods cannot fathom it. (Beyond this, one cannot evade impermanence.) Here, it is utterly pure and undifferentiated, serene and soaring. Within this, the mysteries transform endlessly, beyond description. No wonder its names are many—each person’s perception differs. Each names it according to their vision, and titles it according to their use. Ancient immortals kept it secret and unspoken; only after receiving the transmission with the touch of a hand to the crown could one be taught. Even then, their instructions amounted to no more than: it is neither heart nor kidney. I say it is also not the Yellow Court, the qi-cavity, or the Cinnabar Field. Now I reveal it further—let those who recognize it keep it secret.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Method of the Two Apertures**\nIn the alchemical tradition, there is one cavity, and this cavity has two apertures. Its center is hollow, while its two ends are perforated, hence it is called the *cavity of two apertures*. The master’s transmission—“mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture”—refers precisely to this realm. It is the place where the Conception and Governor Vessels merge, where yin and yang converge, the land where the Crow and Hare come and go.\n\nWithin the one cavity and two apertures lies the method of practice—this method is most profoundly mysterious. The *Triple Concordance* states: “When the upper is closed, it is called *having*; when the lower is closed, it is called *nothing*. *Nothing* serves the upper, where the power of spirit resides. This method of the two apertures also requires the qi of metal.” These few lines exhaust the method of practice.\n\nUpper and lower are Heaven and Earth. *Closed* means dark union. *Having* and *nothing* are the wondrous apertures. *Called* refers to naming and describing. One above, one below—all are concealed within this cavity. Whether *having* or *nothing*, all reside within this cavity. When one attains emptiness and preserves stillness, at the time when Heaven and Earth darkly unite, one may observe its wonder. The wondrous *having*—though indescribable, it may be named, hence it is called *having*. This is what is meant by: “In the profound and obscure, there is essence; within it, there is sincerity.” To observe the aperture through *nothing*—the aperture of emptiness and nothingness—though describable, it cannot be described, hence it is called *nothing*. This is what is meant by: “Within it, things return to no-thing.”\n\n*Nothing* serves the upper—not as an empty return, but as the true lead of the primordial. This is what Laozi spoke of: “The form of the formless, the image of the imageless. One meets it but does not see its head; one follows it but does not see its rear.” In the elixir method, *nothing* serving the upper is to return *nothing* to *having*. What is meant by *serving*? Who offers reverence? Who presents the offering? When the power of spirit humbly resides above, its qi naturally returns—*returning* is *serving*. The only fear is that above, there is no power of spirit. *Above* refers to the region above the Yellow Court; *power* refers to the power of humility and softness. This is what the *Token* meant by: “Reversal is the verification of the Dao; weakness is the handle of virtue.”\n\nTo attain emptiness, one employs the Dao; to seek lead, one employs virtue. Virtue acts, while the Dao does not—one must not fail to understand this method. The two apertures are the gate of the Mysterious Female, the place where the golden elixir is transformed and born. If one knows and practices the method of pursuit and absorption within the one cavity and two apertures, then both gates open. Only then does metal return to nature, and one may be called *returned elixir*. Thus it is said: “the qi of metal also requires it,” and so on. *Requires* means it requires this method of absorption.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Twenty-Three: The Root-Foundation of the Mysterious Female**\n\nThose who cultivate the Mysterious must, whether refining the Great Elixir or the Lesser Elixir, quietly nurture the Valley Spirit to establish their root-foundation. The Valley Spirit is the name for the primordial, empty, and numinous—it is our original nature. Where is it nurtured? In the Mysterious Female.\n\nMaster Shangyang said: “The Mysterious Female consists of two things. Without these two, how could the myriad things come to be?” For *xuan* (玄) is Heaven, and *pin* (牝) is Earth—this is already evident in the first hexagram of the *Book of Changes*. Thus, the one aperture of the Mysterious Female is truly the source of all generation and transformation. How could one who enters the Dao fail to seek this source of generation and transformation? This source of generation and transformation is precisely the aperture of the Mysterious Female.\n\nSome cite the words of Lord Lao: “The Valley Spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female.” But why do they also take the Valley Spirit to be the Mysterious Transformation? The answer is: by borrowing the Mysterious Female of emptiness and nothingness to nurture the Valley Spirit of emptiness and nothingness, they thus name the Mysterious Female after the Valley Spirit. This is the meaning of naming according to function.\n\nMoreover, there is further explanation: *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: “This aperture is no ordinary aperture; it is formed by the union of Qian and Kun. It is called the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, within which lies the essence of Kan and Li.” Thus, the Mysterious Female not only nurtures spirit but also nurtures qi. Now, when spirit and qi merge, the Mysterious Female appears. Therefore, one must concentrate spirit and gather qi, allowing the two to intermingle, only then can the circle of Qian and Kun be formed. Within this lies the function of inversion. Why? That which congeals from above downward is spirit. As the noble body of Mysterious Heaven performs the humble bow of Earthly Female, above and below intermingle harmoniously, and qi and spirit unite.\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: “The union of all under Heaven is the Female of all under Heaven.” For this aperture lies at the center, hence it is called the union of all under Heaven; within it lies the Way of softness, hence it is called the Female of all under Heaven. When speaking of the Female Way, the Mysterious Way is also implied, thus it is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is one Qian and one Kun, one firm and one yielding. Without this, spirit would be strong and qi would be strong, opposing and separating from each other. Therefore, it is said: the male descends to the female, spirit descends to qi, inverting and uniting, yin and yang mating. Only then do spirit and qi meet, and the root-foundation is established. Otherwise, spirit remains spirit and qi remains qi, qi remains qi and spirit remains spirit. If spirit does not obtain qi, there is nothing to supplement spirit. If qi does not return to spirit, there is no function to nurture spirit. How could one hope for the original spirit to abide long?\n\nMoreover, if spirit dwells in the Crimson Palace, the Crimson Palace becomes the bright hall of governance, and all knowledge, perceptions, and disturbances will disturb it. Only by congealing it in the Yellow Court can sounds and thoughts cease—this, too, is not without its quiet nurturing. Thus, *Awakening to Reality* says: “To keep the Valley Spirit ever undying, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root-foundation. When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, a single luminous pearl will never depart.”\n\nThe Valley Spirit is the most empty and numinous mercury-nature. True essence is the purest and most tender lead-emotion. The root-foundation is the place where mercury welcomes lead to forge the Golden Elixir. The Golden Chamber is the Yellow Room. As it is the place where gold returns, it is called the Golden Chamber. When metal-lead and wood-mercury merge, only then is a luminous pearl formed. The luminous pearl is a grain of Golden Elixir, as large as a millet seed. When metal returns to nature at the outset, it may be called the Returned Elixir. Once obtained, it is eternally possessed, hence it is said to “never depart.”\n\nI have often said that this poem by Ziyang directly reveals the true formula of the ages, applicable to both the precelestial and postcelestial. What I have explained pertains to the precelestial. Even from the postcelestial perspective, one must first seek the Mysterious Female to lay the foundation of the Elixir. For the Valley Spirit relies on it to stand, and true essence also relies on it to return. Nurture the Valley Spirit with the Mysterious Female, and nurture true essence with the Valley Spirit. Spirit is cultivated by essence to strengthen the original, and essence is transformed by spirit into qi.\n\nThe *Triple Concordance* says: “Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in stillness and emptiness.” It also says: “The nature-master resides within, establishing the barriers.” From this, we know that the essential task of cultivating the body is to first nurture the Valley Spirit in stillness as the root-foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Direct Indication of the \"Center\"**\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: “Much speech hastens exhaustion; it is better to guard the center.” To recognize this center is to possess the seed of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas. Otherwise, there is no ground for cultivating the Dao, and with every step, one falls into the demonic pit.\n\nWhat is this center? It is the Mysterious Pass. The *Triple Concordance* says: “In movement, do not lose the center,” and “Float and wander, guarding the compass of the center.” Both refer to this.\n\nImmortal Tao said: “The center is not the middle among the four directions or above and below. The Confucians speak of the center as the state before joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure arise; the Daoists speak of the unmoving thought as the Mysterious Female; the Buddhists speak of neither thinking of good nor thinking of evil, and in that very moment, ask: ‘What is the original face?’—this is the true center.”\n\nThe wondrous state of the center naturally nurtures the self, congeals spirit, enters the chamber to return the Elixir, and even transcends the womb to achieve spirit-transformation—all depend on this. Therefore, those who first enter the Dao must recognize this center to have a path of ascent.\n\nIn ancient times, Celestial Master Wen Shi asked the Most High: “What chapter contains the essentials of cultivating the body?” The Most High replied: “It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the center and embracing the One.”\n\nLet me now attempt to expound on these words. At the outset of practice, the learner must firmly hold the sinews and bones, fiercely battle the sleep demon, seal the senses and lower the curtains, detach from all delusive thoughts, and turn the light inward to illuminate the three cavities. These three cavities are the Yellow Court, the Sea of Qi, and the Cinnabar Field.",

      "translated_text": "Yet though one turns the light inward to illuminate the three cavities, one must neither fix the mind upon them nor let it wander among them. Only then does spirit settle within, breath follow its natural course, and all distinctions dissolve into utter oblivion, leaving no trace or sign. This is precisely what the *Classic* means by “desireless, observe its mystery.”\n\nAt the moment of perfect emptiness and quiescent guarding, when spirit congeals and qi unites, an unexpected realm may suddenly emerge from the compass of awareness—boundless without, infinitesimal within—whereupon the Mysterious Pass appears. This is what the *Classic* means by “desiring, observe its aperture.”\n\nFurther examining the *Contract*, it states: “Closing above is called *having*; closing below is called *not-having*.” I submit that these “above” and “below” both lie concealed within the character *center*. Yin and yang course within it; Kan and Li ascend and descend between them, merging above and below into its midst. Thus, when the upper is closed and the lower sealed, the mechanism remains subtly secure. Within the Great Void, the primordial qi moves alone—hence *not-having*, which is also the purport of observing mystery. When the lower is closed and the upper sealed, the hidden remains unseen. Yet within the profound obscurity, essence abides, and within it, a sign exists—hence *having* and *desiring*, all residing in the subtleties of the Mysterious. Therefore, the single aperture of the Mysterious Pass is variously called the aperture of having and not-having, the upper and lower crucibles, the cauldron of yin and yang, or the cavity of spirit and qi. All derive from this, and all are subsumed within the One Center.\n\nThe Master commented: “To study the Dao, study the Dao—first one must grasp its mystery. Without grasping its mystery, one cannot glimpse its aperture. To glimpse its aperture, one must hear the Dao.” I and Tuanyang shared a knowing smile.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Five: A Direct Explanation of Medicinal Substances**\nWhat are medicinal substances? Shangyang said: “This medicine arises from within things.” Medicines are of two kinds: lesser medicine and greater medicine, corresponding to the Dao’s division into prior-heaven and posterior-heaven. Posterior-heaven medicine is lesser medicine, used for forming the elixir. Prior-heaven medicine is greater medicine, used for returning the elixir. Posterior-heaven medicine is formless and without substance yet truly exists; prior-heaven medicine has form and function yet is truly non-existent.\n\nPosterior-heaven true lead discards *gui* and selects *ren*, concealing yang within yin to generate being from non-being. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “How could the three primals and eight trigrams depart from *ren*?” The three primals are the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. *Ren* is born of Heaven’s One, residing before *zi*, the origin of the first yang. Both *ren* and *gui* dwell in the northern Kan, where water pertains to yin. *Ren*-water is yang within yin; *gui*-water is yin within yin. Moreover, *ren* and *gui* are stems, while *hai* and *zi* are branches. To seek true lead, one must take the heavenly stems as primary and the earthly branches as secondary, for heaven precedes earth.\n\nIn essence, *ren* signifies only the primal meaning—the beginning without thought or deliberation, the moment before movement returns to stillness. *Zi*, by contrast, is the time of knowing and awareness, the threshold between stillness and movement. *Gui*-yin is not used, and *hai*, not yet free of yin, is also not used. This is the method for seeking lesser medicine.\n\nPrior-heaven medicine is otherwise: it is produced in Kun and sown in Qian, generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. When Qian-metal enters Kun, it is called “metal within Kun.” Kun truly becomes Kan, called “metal within water.” Kan resides in the north, while Dui in the west is its neighbor, so it may be said to lodge in Dui. It is not sought in Qian, for Qian is the place of sowing. It is not sought in Kun, for Kun is the place of containing the primordial. It is not sought in Kan, for though Kan contains yang, it remains hidden within water, its qi-mechanism not yet revealed. It is sought directly in Dui, where lead produces yang and the metal manifests—like the moon’s third day, emerging from the *geng* direction.\n\nThus, Kan-water is the river’s source, and Dui-metal is the medicinal substance. It is not that Qian, Kun, Kan, and Dui are arrayed within the body; rather, all is a matter of generating non-being from being, seeking the other from the self. I move a single drop of yin-fire’s essence, sowing it within the other’s household, thereby generating yang within lead. When yang-qi stirs, it is gathered and returned, then sown within my own womb-palace to form the true person. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: “Relying on Kun’s position, the body is formed; sown in Qian’s household, the palace of mutual resonance.” The sowing in Qian is the initial planting; the sowing in Qian’s household is nurturing. If Cui and Zhang were to rise again, they would surely affirm this humble interpretation.\n\nThe mechanism of sowing lead to obtain lead is thus. Yet the method of sowing lead must lie between the sequence of *ding* and *ren*, then the effects of Zhen and Dui may take their turn. My teacher’s oral instructions are all contained herein. The true mechanism of inner and outer medicines is now laid bare. Those who grasp these words are thrice blessed—do not treat them lightly.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six: Discerning Lead and Mercury**\nThe spirit within the heart is called mercury-nature; the essence within the heart is called mercury-fluid. Gathering mercury-nature in the Yellow Court and congealing mercury-fluid in the Purple Palace produces dragon-mercury, which is true mercury, the inner elixir, the yin elixir, and the posterior-heaven half-catty.\n\nThe qi within the body is called lead-essence; the essence within the body is called lead-flower. Observing lead-essence in the Kan Palace and gathering lead-flower at the Dui Gate produces tiger-lead, which is true lead, the outer elixir, the yang elixir, and the prior-heaven eight-ounce mother.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven: A Direct Explanation of the Crucible**\nIn the elixir method, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible, and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Taking from Kan to fill Li, metal first returns. Kun’s form has six segments, its body fundamentally empty.",
      "overlap_context": "body?” The Most High replied: “It lies in deeply rooting and firmly establishing, guarding the center and embracing the One.”\n\nLet me now attempt to expound on these words. At the outset of practice, the learner must firmly hold the sinews and bones, fiercely battle the sleep demon, seal the senses and lower the curtains, detach from all delusive thoughts, and turn the light inward to illuminate the three cavities. These three cavities are the Yellow Court, the Sea of Qi, and the Cinnabar Field.",

      "translated_text": "At the extreme of earth’s yin configuration, one yang returns to restore. Qian’s form has three continuous lines, its body entirely solid. Within heaven’s flourishing yang configuration, one yin suddenly arises. Between heaven and earth, the solid cannot contain things, while the empty can receive. Thus, one borrows Kun’s emptiness to conceal its solidity and first casts Qian’s solid into its emptiness. The method’s workings are thus, yet one must also understand the transference of metal to distinguish the maturity of the medicine. From the prior-heaven Qian-metal concealed within Kun’s position, at this moment yin contains yang. Though it resembles the one within Kan, the form lies hidden beneath water, secret and unrevealed. Only when metal appears within water—like the moon rising in the west at Dui—does it become usable metal. Harvested in the span of one talisman, this is precisely the time of having qi without substance. Taking from Dui is like taking from Kan; producing from Dui is like producing from Kun. Yet without the radiance of Qian-father’s essence, this great medicine cannot be produced. Though it serves as host, I become the guest. While it seeks to ascend, I descend instead. Guest and host rise and sink, all operating within the crucible. Only then does one realize the crucible’s design lies in its emptiness.\n\nMaster Tao says: “Within the crucible, originally there is nothing. After the two-sevens’ period, moved by Qian-father’s radiant essence, yang qi first stirs. Within the Qian crucible, originally there is also nothing. At the time of harvesting, receiving Kun-mother’s yang-lead, the golden elixir begins to congeal. All is created ex nihilo. The term ‘crucible’ merely borrows this as a vessel to hold things.” His words are most profound, hence recorded here.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight: Qian, Kun, Li, and Kan**\nPrior-heaven is Qian and Kun; posterior-heaven is Kan and Li. Yet prior-heaven has Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li. Posterior-heaven has Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun. What is the reason? Prior-heaven as Qian and Kun means primordial yang remains unbroken in youthful purity, internally possessing Qian’s image with yang firmly established, externally possessing Kun’s image with yin firmly established—hence called prior-heaven Qian and Kun. Posterior-heaven as Kan and Li means that in middle age, primordial yang has departed, Kun envelops Qian’s yang to form Kan, and Qian envelops Kun’s yin to form Li—hence called posterior-heaven Kan and Li. Prior-heaven having Qian and Kun while also containing Kan and Li means using Qian and Kun as the crucible and Kan and Li as the medicinal substances. Posterior-heaven having Kan and Li while also containing Qian and Kun means employing Kan and Li in subtle work to restore Qian and Kun’s original body.\n\nThere is more to know: the substance refined in posterior-heaven’s self-cultivation is called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to taking from Kan to fill Li to form the Jade-Fluid Returned Elixir. The substance refined in prior-heaven’s return to the origin is also called prior-heaven Kan and Li, referring to transforming Kan into Li to produce the Golden-Fluid Returned Elixir. Both prior-heaven and posterior-heaven’s taking from Kan are called prior-heaven, differing only in whether the medicine comes from another or is planted in one’s own field.\n\nIn my humble opinion: prior-heaven Qian and Kun are the celestial medicine, just as posterior-heaven Kan and Li are the human medicine. A youth who receives the method and meets a teacher sits guarding Qian and Kun to attain the Dao. Once fallen into posterior-heaven, Qian and Kun are renamed the crucible.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Subtle Work of Harvesting and Refining**\nHarvesting and refining means gathering the other’s yang-lead and refining the qi of one’s own child-pearl. Yang-lead is earth’s po, for it is concealed within the extreme yin outside, hence called earth’s po. When obtained during self-refinement, it can control one’s mercury-nature and transform it into cinnabar. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Simply use earth’s po to capture mercury-sand”—one need only know how to harvest and refine.\n\nWhat is harvesting? Harvesting with non-harvesting. What is refining? Refining with non-refining.\n\nWhat is non-harvesting harvesting? Dragon at ease, tiger at rest, guarding the feminine without masculinity. In the month of the winter solstice, its qi begins to rise. The spirit immediately follows its ascent, reversing into the crucible, drawing it in—this is non-harvesting harvesting.\n\nWhat is non-refining refining? When it is in my home, the medicine itself is fire. After prolonged fusion, its yin naturally transforms. Yang then grows accordingly, accumulating in the furnace and naturally circulating—hence called non-refining refining.\n\nYet one must concentrate the spirit to await it, then harvest it. Regulate the breath to guard it, then refine it. When essence is entirely transformed into qi, the abdomen becomes full, and the inner elixir can be formed.\n\n**Chapter Thirty: The River Chariot’s Subtle Essentials**\nThe River Chariot is the essential method of moving the medicine after obtaining it, not the method of imagined transference. It is the fire-timing of advancing and retreating at midnight and noon, the closing of yin and yang, the ascending and descending of internal and external, the natural fire of heaven and earth. From the foundation-building stage onward, after the golden crucible is full, regulate the inner breath and concentrate the inner spirit. When spirit and breath depend on each other, wind and fire merge. Suddenly, the spiritual sprout sprouts, and the qi-mechanism stirs. I then activate the River Chariot to refine it, causing it to move from below to the rear, entering through the Governing Vessel, flowing backward to the Celestial Valley, and returning to the Central Palace—this is the proper procedure after obtaining the medicine.\n\nAlas, later generations lacking true transmission often fall into imagined transference, moving emptily back and forth—what benefit is there? Only because few attain subtle realization do immortals’ teachers find it difficult to explain. Now I shall attempt to clarify: its subtlety lies in intent guarding within and spirit driving without. Yet since this explanation exists, skeptics abound.\n\nThe reason is that the true spirit is the true intent—how can they be divided in two places? Presiding within while also presiding without, how can one fulfill two roles alone? This doubt is inevitable. Yet one must know that when the spirit guards the inner court, it values concentration, not movement. Movement necessarily employs intent.",

      "translated_text": "The marvel of the celestial cycle lies in its external movement being effortless while its internal governance is laborious—thus the internal governance must be borne by intent. It is like a person sitting before a lamp: the shadow appears on the wall, and as the body moves, the shadow moves with it. Speech arises within the room, and sound flows beyond the walls—words uttered, sound follows. Intent is like the body and speech of the spirit; the spirit is like the shadow and echo of intent. There has never been a case where they do not see or hear each other. Therefore, when intent calculates within, the spirit naturally moves without—though two, they remain one. Moving within is moving without; one need not attend to it, for they naturally know each other.\n\nWhy is this so? True intent resides at the center, directing breath to respond within and without—this is inherently knowing the internal. Yet as true intent flows, piercing barriers and crossing the crown, there is a subtle mutual awareness. Is this the spirit? Is this intent? Does this spirit return to this intent? Master Wu said: \"There is a subtle intent of mutual knowing\"—this is precisely it. I do not know how spirit and intent transform their forms or divide their presence, nor how they coordinate within and without. To claim ignorance is true knowledge.\n\nI simply submit to my intent and regulate my inner self: here, qi stirs; there, qi ascends. Here, wind moves; there, wind carries. Here is intent; there is spirit. Spirit and intent—divided yet undivided. One feels that the guardian within manages household affairs, while the driver without ascends to the heavenly gate, yet knows not how this subtle intent of mutual awareness arises.\n\nProfound, oh profound! Riding the immortal raft, drifting on the Silver River, paying court to the azure vault, returning to the Yellow Court—mechanism smooth, spirit flowing, bliss unbounded.

      "translated_text": "Should the true transmission not be expounded in detail,\nNo matter where you seek, your search shall be in vain.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One: On the True Heart**\n\nThe Dao of the Golden Elixir values the attainment of true spirit, true qi, and true essence, for only then can the work of creation be accomplished. Yet without employing the true heart, one cannot obtain this true essence, true qi, or true spirit.\n\nThe true heart resides in the moment before discriminating thoughts arise, before human desires intermingle, before the sprouts of yin qi are tainted. The wondrous Dao of cultivating the body begins with settling into stillness. For the student whose refinement of the self remains impure, only this practice can yield results. It is what strategists call striking when the enemy least expects, attacking when they are unprepared.\n\nWhen the mind-ground momentarily clears, I seal the Three Treasures, concentrate the spirit, and regulate the breath. Inner thoughts do not stray outward; outer thoughts do not intrude. At this time, before desires arise, effort yields immediate effect. Seizing the moment before the spirit of consciousness is employed, one may perceive the true spirit. Seizing the moment before turbid qi stirs, one may nurture the true qi. Seizing the moment before lustful essence scatters, one may await the true essence.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, one attains utmost emptiness and abides in profound stillness, thereby recognizing the mysterious pass. This is the foremost principle of dual cultivation of nature and life. How wondrous is the function of the true heart!\n\nIf, however, one waits until affairs, interactions, laughter, speech, or eating stir the mind’s mechanism before attempting to restrain it, the inner heart will already be stirred, and杂念 will have arisen. If I suppress them and they cease, it is fortunate. But should they cease only to rise again, or be driven away only to return—each attempt to expel them only multiplying their number—then one faces a formidable foe. Closing the eyes, one wages war between heaven and humanity; touching the heart, one finds a field of ruin. The heart is defeated. What then can be done?\n\nGenerally, beginners cannot compare to those long detached from worldly ties, who forget emotions when facing circumstances. Those who suddenly awaken to emptiness are indeed of superior wisdom, while those who gradually awaken to their nature are not of inferior rank. The student need only seek the true heart as the starting point. Though their refinement of the self may be incomplete, they may still enter the gate of stillness, provided they grasp the true heart whenever it appears.\n\nThis true heart may arise at dawn, at dusk, or at any hour within the twelve. One must recognize and seize it for oneself. Though this teaching may seem novel, it is not truly so. Moreover, it benefits beginners and harmonizes with the ancient alchemical classics without contradiction.\n\nIf one gradually cultivates thus—guarding the true at all times, embracing the true each day, never failing to perceive it—then through gradual progress one attains constancy. Over time, purity and stillness become complete, and the work of refining the self is naturally encompassed. Is this not grand?\n\nThus, when the mind-ground is momentarily clear, it is a precious opportunity for practice, a golden moment, a wondrous state. May one treasure it as if a single instant were worth a thousand gold.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two: Direct Exposition on the Heart and Spirit**\n*(Including the Method of Breath Regulation)*\n\nThe heart is the master of the entire body; the spirit is the supreme medicine of the three grades. One must discern whether heart and spirit are two or one.\n\nLaozi said: \"The human spirit delights in clarity, but the heart disturbs it. The human heart delights in stillness, but desires drag it away. Thus, constantly dispelling desires, the heart becomes still of itself. Clarifying the heart, the spirit becomes clear of itself.\"\n\nLu Qianxu said: \"The method of regulating the breath begins with regulating the heart. The method of concentrating the spirit begins with regulating the breath.\" This is the bridge of sages, immortals, and buddhas, the path by which we enter virtue.\n\nThose who begin to study the Dao must gather their thoughts and return to stillness. In movement and rest, sitting and lying down, all must reside within the cavity of the chest, for only then can the guarding of stillness be steadfast.\n\nFor the mind with thoughts is the deluded heart; the mind without thoughts is the true heart. If one can collect their thoughts in daily life and return them to their proper place, they can focus their mind in the moment and solidify the foundation of entering samadhi. As the sages said: \"Knowing where to stop, one attains stability; with stability, one attains stillness.\"\n\nWhen the heart is still, the breath is easily regulated. The subtler the heart, the more refined the breath. When the breath is regulated, the spirit returns. Thereupon, one further stabilizes the spirit, concentrating it within the qi cavity.\n\nThe heart, then, is also called spirit. Why? The heart resides in the Crimson Palace. When stirred, it becomes thoughts; when stilled, it returns to being the heart. Returning the still heart to the chamber of spirit, it becomes spirit. Spirit is without thought, without worry, without action—yet within non-action, all actions are possible; within non-use, great use is concealed. This is the supreme medicine of the three grades.\n\nWhen concentrating the spirit, one must ensure it remains dependent on the breath. Do not let the spirit chase the breath, nor let it manipulate the breath. Chasing the breath scatters the spirit; manipulating the breath agitates it. Simply allow the breath to move naturally, following its own rhythm. Thus, the spirit becomes ever more concentrated.\n\nWhen stillness reaches its extreme and movement arises, the spirit has grasped the mechanism of qi. The qi first breaks through primordial chaos—motionless, yet responsive and interconnected. Is this not the active practice of the Daoist cultivator?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Wondrous Function of Spirit and Breath**\n\nSpirit is fire; breath is wind. To comprehend the mysterious mechanism of wind and fire, one must properly settle spirit and breath.\n\nThe spirit should be inwardly luminous yet silent; the breath should rely on true qi, flowing continuously. Simply stabilize the spirit without chasing the breath. It is like gathering fire in a furnace while drawing wind through bellows. The wind fans the flames, making them burn brighter, and the metal naturally melts. Thus, the wind comes to assist the fire—it is not the fire pursuing the wind.\n\nYet within this lies a subtle mechanism: to ensure the bellows’ qi blows with focused intensity, the wind pipe must press close to the furnace, allowing it to pass through the regulator. Only then can it fan the furnace’s flames, deepening their azure hue.",

Day after day in circulation, morning after morning in passage, qi surges through the hundred joints, infusing the three palaces. Only then does the obtained medicine avoid idleness and waste, and true qi grow ever more abundant.\n\nAlas! The world’s people, oblivious to the river chariot’s essence, toil in vain with laborious transference, exhausting their minds.",

      "translated_text": "When the practitioner gathers spirit and collects qi, it is like fire melting metal. When the breath blows into the Kan (Water) trigram, it is like guiding the pipe close to the furnace, creating the momentum of wind aiding fire. As the furnace’s fire blazes, yang radiance surges. At this moment, spirit is qi, and qi is the elixir—just as fire forges iron red-hot, and red-hot iron is itself fire. This is what Qiongguan Weng meant by “fire is the elixir, the elixir is fire.” When fire and elixir merge, the Golden Elixir is instantly formed. If the breath does not blow inward but merely plays at the throat and nose, it is like the pipe not pressing close to the furnace. Is this not laughable?\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four: Further Discussion on Spirit and Breath**\n\nWhen the breath is still, the spirit returns. The method of gathering spirit relies on regulating the breath. When the spirit is settled, the breath rests. The method of regulating the breath also relies on gathering the spirit. For when spirit is preserved in emptiness, the internal breath truly exists. Thus, the breath lingers because of the spirit, and the spirit remains because of the breath. Spirit and breath are balanced, neither fully present nor absent—one does not know whether spirit is breath or breath is spirit. Wind fans the fire, and fire burns with the wind. They sustain and intertwine, so that one does not know whether wind is fire or fire is wind. When the practice is fully refined, there is truly something beyond description in words.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Five: The Wondrous Use of Qi and Breath**\n\nCao Yuanjun said: “I tell you all the truth: the root of life has always resided in the true breath.” Why is the true breath the root of life? Because the postnatal breath harmonizes with the prenatal breath, and the prenatal breath is the true qi within the body, stirred by the breath into gentle ebb and flow. At this time, is it the breath moving? Or is it the qi moving? When the breath moves, the qi moves as well—neither is distinct. The breath contains qi, hence it is called the “misty true breath.” The qi contains breath, hence it is called the “bellows of true breath.” When the true breath moves, true qi is born; when true qi arrives, the root of life is born. The root of returning to life, the source of nurturing life, the treasure of protecting life—all truly lie in the true breath.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Six: The Wondrous Use of Spirit and Intention**\n\nSpirit values concentration, as the *Cantong Qi* says: “Abide in tranquility and emptiness, inwardly illuminating the body.” Spirit is not intention, as it is said: “To inwardly illuminate the Mysterious Pass, one must employ true intention.” I have heard Chongxu say: “True intention is the right awakening within emptiness.” Qianxu said: “To infuse above and below, the primordial spirit must operate within.” The primordial spirit’s operation is the primordial spirit’s right awakening. One cannot say that the primordial spirit is true intention—they differ in substance and function. For in profound stillness and non-action, the spirit governs and moves in quietude. In composed elegance, intention manages affairs without confusion. Thus, spirit is the lord of the elixir, and intention is its emissary. Spirit and intention truly differ in substance and function. Since they differ in substance and function, they are two. Yet because function arises from substance, they may also be regarded as one. However, there is a further point: to cultivate true intention, one must nurture primordial qi. True intention arises from extreme stillness, thereby perfecting one’s wondrous use. This is what the Dao calls “constantly responding, constantly still,” what the Confucians call “being at ease before contemplation,” and what the Buddhists call “wisdom arising from samadhi.”\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven: Further Discussion on Spirit and Intention**\n\nAt the beginning of sitting with lowered eyelids, spirit and intention need not be distinguished. But when movement and stillness alternate, then spirit and intention part ways. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with spirit, and it will not do to substitute intention. This applies when attaining emptiness, preserving stillness, and observing return—such as at the moment of tending the furnace. Sometimes one should guard the Central Palace with intention, and it will not do to lead with spirit. This applies when capturing lead, restraining mercury, and wielding the Celestial Stem—such as during the alchemical union. Why? Spirit is non-action, while intention is action. Spirit is non-action yet all-accomplishing; intention is action with purpose. Spirit is the spirit of intention, and intention takes spirit as its true origin—spirit governs stillness. Intention is the intention of spirit, and spirit takes intention as its right awakening—intention enables movement. To nurture primordial spirit, one must take “no thought” as the foundation, thereby achieving non-action and all-accomplishment. Shangyang’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi* says: “The true person lurks in the deep abyss, responding with no thought. Floating and wandering within the compass, employing with no thought. Breathing in harmony, achieving with no thought. The three natures unite, entering with no thought.” The use of no thought is not limited to this. To activate true intention, one must first refine the self, thereby achieving action and purposeful action. Qianxu’s *Jiuzheng Pian* says: “Refine the self to seek lead, welcoming it with the self. Draw fire into the crucible, sending it with the self. Smelt and bathe, guarding it with the self. Warm and nurture, completing it with the self.” The wondrousness of the self’s earth is also not limited to this. Ah, spirit! Ah, intention! They run through the entire process of Golden Elixir cultivation, never to be parted for even a moment. There are other wondrous uses, but they all depend on the practitioner’s own inquiry. I have merely compiled these teachings to open the way.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight: The Debate on Attaining Immortality**\n\nThe ancients said: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, and the next establish teachings—all three are immortal.” To preserve the immortal spirit is the Dao. The three are also immortal because they assist the Dao. Benevolent virtue is the substance of the Dao, and humble virtue is its function. Universal salvation is the substance of the Dao, and self-cultivation is its function. As for teachings, they are the record of merit and virtue, the writings that convey the Dao.",

      "translated_text": "Thus do they contend together for immortality.\n\nNow, what decays is common, and what does not decay is sagely. That by which one may contend for immortality lies in having nothing to contend for, yet also in having something to contend for. Having nothing to contend for, one places oneself last and paradoxically becomes first; one softens one’s resolve and yet overcomes the rigid. Having something to contend for, one displays the beard and brows of a man, the backbone of a true hero, the boldness of a champion, and the ferocity of a great soul. Not contending with others for a fleeting moment, one contends with them for all eternity.\n\nConfucius said: “When it comes to benevolence, one does not yield even to one’s teacher.” The teacher fears precisely that the disciple may fail to contend—merely collapsing into cowardice. A former Confucian master said: “The qi of dawn’s clarity and the spirit of the still night differ not at all from those of the sages. If one can expand upon this, even Confucius and Yan Hui would not surpass them.” The Śākya tradition states: “In the stillness of able benevolence, how does one differ from Śākyamuni? In the profound practice of prajñā, how is one distinct from freedom itself?” Daoist texts say: “Did Gautama arise from the earth? Did Zhong and Lü descend from heaven?” All these contend for the Dao and do not necessarily yield to those who came before. Let the aspirant take heed!\n\nThe myriad truths and ten thousand sages fundamentally do not begrudge others contending for the Dao.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine: On Retiring After Success and Fame**\n\nThe *Daodejing* states: “To retire after success and fame is the Way of Heaven.” I hold that the Way of Heaven is also the Way of humanity, and likewise the Way of self-cultivation. Heaven’s success and fame lie in the flourishing of growth and fulfillment; as the seasons turn and beings are nurtured, the heavenly Dao retreats and withdraws, concealing itself in winter’s reign. Such is the Way of Heaven. For humans, success and fame lie in utmost loyalty; having achieved merit, one retires with courage, and having attained fame, one conceals oneself—thus do heroes follow the example of Master Red Pine. Or, success and fame may lie in perfect filial piety: the mutual nourishment of will and body is the merit, and the universal praise of the clan is the fame. When parents reach a hundred years, the filial child’s duty is complete; one retires to preserve life—such is the Way of humanity. For the alchemist, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness is merit without merit; the profound and indistinct is fame without fame. When the return is accomplished, the sacred embryo is formed, and fame is attained, one retires to the ancestral aperture, embracing the One and returning to emptiness—such is the Way of elixir cultivation. Those who comprehend this should reflect on its resonance with virtue and human nature.\n\n**Chapter Forty: On the Unity of Immortal and Buddha Cultivation**\n\nThe dual cultivation of nature and life is the essential principle for becoming an immortal, attaining buddhahood, or achieving sagehood. Some claim that Buddhists cultivate nature, Daoists cultivate life, and Confucians govern the world, each with distinct paths—yet this stems from a shallow understanding of their fundamental principles.\n\nIn my view: Buddhism emphasizes nature, yet within it lies a special transmission beyond the teachings. It is not that life is absent, but rather that it is spoken of in secret. The emphasis on nature is intended to enable one to establish life through nature, expanding the capacity of nature to illuminate the ten directions without boundary. Daoism emphasizes life, yet within it lies a true transmission within the teachings. It is not that nature is unmentioned, but rather that it is discussed sparingly. The emphasis on life is intended to enable one to comprehend nature through life, securing the root of life to endure through ten thousand kalpas without end.\n\nIf the cultivation of nature is perfected yet the external cultivation of life is neglected, true nature will be difficult to preserve, ultimately remaining in empty stillness—how then can one encompass the realms of sand and dust? If the cultivation of life is thorough yet the internal cultivation of nature is incomplete, true life may be preserved, but only the physical body is maintained—how then can one attain spiritual penetration of the three realms?\n\nOnly Buddhism possesses a special transmission beyond the teachings, enabling one to establish life through nature, so that the Land of Ultimate Bliss becomes ever more luminous and empty. Only Daoism possesses a true transmission within the teachings, enabling one to comprehend nature through life, so that the Heaven of Great Purity becomes ever more transcendent. Thus, immortals, buddhas, and sages—all engage in dual cultivation, not single cultivation.\n\nWhen Śākyamuni entered deep meditation, his crown was pierced and his knees were transfixed. When Mahākāśyapa expounded the true meaning, he caused the flagpole of the monastery to topple. What do you make of this?\n\nMaster Lü said: “To cultivate nature alone without cultivating life is the foremost illness in spiritual practice.” Master Ziyang said: “Even if you fully awaken to the true suchness of nature, you will still have to discard one body only to enter another. How much better to cultivate the great medicine as well, and swiftly transcend the leaky to become a true person.” These examples may be taken as one corner from which the rest may be inferred.\n\nWhen prajñā is practiced profoundly, the five aggregates are all empty. When the elixir matures and the great return is achieved, one faces the wall for ten years. At sixty, the ears are attuned; at seventy, the heart follows its desires. Only then are nature and life both perfected, ascending together to the realm of emptiness and transcendence—thus do immortals, buddhas, and sages all attain fulfillment.\n\nThe *Song of Enlightenment* by the First Patriarch Bodhidharma states:\n*“The three teachings share one method,\nDo not regard them as two.\nNature and life must be cultivated together,\nSo that heaven and earth do not decay.”*\n\nWhy, then, must one engage in disputes?\n\nMoreover, there is this further point: the transmission of the three teachings remains unknown to their followers. If they understood this, they would not contradict one another. Each should simply fulfill its own Way and return to the Dao.\n\nNow, suppose there were a master of the great Dao who addressed the three teachings, saying: “The three teachings are the three pillars of my Way. Though divided into three, they are united as one. The Dao cannot be divided, for then it would lack transformation; the Dao cannot be united, for then it would lack a governing principle. Thus, the three pillars establish its ultimate expression.\n\nThe Buddhist and Daoist teachings speak of nature while silently transmitting life; the Daoist and immortal teachings transmit life while silently transmitting nature. The Confucian teaching takes the bearing of worldly responsibilities as its urgent task. Nature is rarely spoken of, life is even more seldom mentioned, and both nature and life are cultivated in silence. As a result, the descendants of the three traditions, each adhering to their ancestral lineage, have become specialized schools. They stir the heavens and shake the earth, debating right and wrong, opening boundless realms of contention. When Buddhists attack Daoism, they employ marvelous strategies of overturning emptiness. When Daoists attack Buddhism, they employ divine insights of pointing directly to reality.”",

Since the Dao divides into three, how could there be no divergence in its offshoots, no distinction between the heterodox and the orthodox? Why, then, do they not contemplate the root but instead debate the branches?\n\nTo regard nature as encompassing life is one current; to regard life as encompassing nature is another; to merge nature and life into one is yet another. These three currents are all currents of the Dao.

The author of this book, Li Hanxu, is commonly known as the Western School. Though its main principles do not exceed the scope of the *Triple Unification* and *Awakening to Reality*, having formed its own school, it must possess distinctive features not found in other alchemical classics. Scholars should discern these differences.\n\n2. As practitioners’ efforts progress in stages and their levels vary in depth, the text introduces the theory of the three \"river chariots.\" The first river chariot refers to the first stage of practice, the second to the second stage, and the third to the third stage. However, the path of circulating the river chariot remains singular, without divergence. Do not mistakenly assume there are three separate paths.\n\n3. In the sections on the three river chariots, there may be instances of excessive description or inappropriate analogies. Readers should not cling to the literal meaning or force interpretations.\n\n4. The *Mind-Collecting Method* in the appendix is particularly essential. If one studies it carefully, one will surely benefit.\n\n5. The *Daoist Songs, Poems, and Miscellaneous Writings* also contain subtle meanings. If readers can draw connections and extend understanding, it would be most excellent.\n\n6. This book is an old manuscript, transmitted for over eighty years without ever being printed. Aside from the three chapters on the river chariots, other sections—such as the *Mind-Collecting Method* and *Daoist Songs*—were not originally titled separately nor properly attributed under the *Secret Teachings of the Three Vehicles*. Their arrangement was also disordered. Here, two appendices are newly designated, and the text has been reorganized for the reader’s convenience.\n\n7. Previous alchemical works were composed either to seek external protection or to instruct disciples, not for universal salvation or posterity. Thus, they need not be comprehensible to all, and in fact, precautions were taken to prevent universal understanding. Hence, cryptic terms and obscure names abound, leaving readers bewildered, unsure of their meaning. Often, the intended meaning is concealed, and the truth is obscured. This is why no Daoist practitioner fails to lament the difficulty of reading alchemical classics.\n\n8. If the meaning of this book remains unclear, one should seek answers in *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*. If *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries* still eludes comprehension, one should consult the *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*, as they can mutually illuminate one another.\n\nWritten in May of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) by Chen Yingning of Wanjian in Shanghai.\n\n**A Brief Biography of the Perfected Li Hanxu**",

      "translated_text": "The Perfected One was a native of Changyishan in Lijiahe, Leshan County, Jiading Prefecture, Sichuan. Born on the fourth day of the eighth lunar month at the hour of *yin* in the *bingyin* year of the Jiaqing reign (1786), his mother dreamed, at the moment of his birth, of a Daoist priest entering her home cradling a golden book in his arms; upon waking, she found the Perfected One already born. He was the second of three brothers, with his elder and younger siblings both becoming Daoist priests. From childhood, he was exceptionally bright, and in his youth, he entered the county academy as a scholar. Skilled in the zither and fond of poetry and wine, at the age of twenty-four, he encountered the Patriarch Lü but did not recognize him.\n\nLater, afflicted with a blood-wasting illness, he followed his mother’s command to convalesce in Emei County, where he met Master Zheng Pushan. Master Zheng, a man of the Kangxi era, was a senior disciple of the Perfected Sun, whose personal name was Jiaoluan. Sharing lodgings with him for treatment, the master said, “Minerals, plants, and herbs can only address symptoms. To cure the root, one must employ the wondrous medicine of one’s own body—only then can true solidity be achieved.” Upon hearing this, the Perfected One felt as though awakening from a dream and immediately bowed in reverence, taking refuge under the master. Zheng then transmitted oral instructions, urging, “A great kalpa is approaching; you must swiftly cultivate to save the world. Moreover, you will have a primordial master among the Perfected.”\n\nLater, on Mount Emei, he encountered the Patriarchs Lü and Zhang in a monastic hall. His original name was Yuanzhi, styled Pingquan. The Patriarch Lü changed it to Xiyue, styled Hanxu, with an alternate name Tuanyang, secretly imparting the original sound. After several years of secluded cultivation, he achieved the Golden Elixir. The Three Masters reappeared, exhorting him to hasten in writing books to save the world.\n\nIn obedience to the command of the Three Perfected Ones, he composed *Annotations on the Thirteen Classics of the Most High*, *Elucidations on the Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Old Immortal*, and two commentaries on *The Rootless Tree*, collectively titled *Fifteen Daoist Discourses*, also known as *Essentials of Preserving the Body*. He edited and revised the Patriarch Lü’s chronicles, sacred traces, alchemical classics, and salvific texts, naming the collection *Marvelous Encounters at Sea and Mountain*. He compiled the complete works of the Patriarch Zhang, titling it *Complete Works of Zhang Sanfeng*. His own writings, including *Ninefold Refinement of the Heart*, *Scripture of the End of Literature*, and *A Treatise on the Postcelestial*, were all published. Additionally, he authored *Inner Chapters of Rounded Peaks*, *Secret Essentials of the Three Vehicles*, and *Discourses on the Dao’s Mysteries*, none of which were published.\n\nIn the first month of the *bingshen* year of the Xianfeng reign (1856), I visited his abode at Changyishan and beheld his compassionate countenance, which appeared no older than thirty. After taking leave, the master ascended on the eighth day of the fifth lunar month at the hour of *yin*, with an extraordinary fragrance filling the sky for seven days. On that same day at the hour of *mao*, his immortal form manifested at Ziliujing. Following his ascension, his miraculous traces were too numerous to recount in full.\n\nThe master had two sons: the elder pursued Confucian scholarship, while the younger tilled the land. His eldest brother had three sons, the eldest of whom, at eleven years old, was intelligent, kind, and filial—qualities the master often praised with admiration. Though his disciples were many, only Zhou Daochang of Jiangxi achieved the Great Elixir, while several others attained the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir. My virtue being meager and my karmic affinity shallow, I served the master but briefly. Here, I have merely outlined what I personally witnessed.\n\nRespectfully recorded by his disciple Li Daoshan of Qiaoyang, Jianning County, Fujian.",

      "translated_text": "The Three Chariots refer to three types of *heche* (River Chariots). The first is the circulation of *qi*, which is the *xiaozhoutian* (Small Celestial Cycle) of firing at *zi* and *wu*; the second is the circulation of essence, which is the *yuye heche* (Jade Fluid River Chariot) for warming and nourishing with water; the third is the simultaneous circulation of essence and *qi*, which is the *dazhoutian* (Great Celestial Cycle) of refining precelestial gold and mercury, the Sevenfold Returned Elixir, and the Ninefold Returned Great Elixir. These Three Chariots all rely on the true spirit and true intent to govern their course. If one can comprehend the secret principles of the Three Chariots, then essence, *qi*, and spirit—these three treasures—will be perfectly complete, and the Three Immortals of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity will be attained.\n\nThe first River Chariot, the practice of circulating *qi*, is for opening the passes and laying the foundation, obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Its sequence begins with nurturing the true breath within emptiness. Collect the mind, regulate the breath, close the eyes, and preserve the spirit. Stillness upon stillness, purity upon purity. Let go of all things, forgetting the entire body. In utter chaos and profound obscurity, when the work reaches this point, it is like winter in the heavens, when the myriad things flourish and each returns to its root; like night in the sun’s course, when the water clock sinks deep and each quiets its heart. This is the time of no-knowledge, no-perception. Yet who knows that in this moment of no-knowledge and no-perception, the first yang revives—just as winter gives birth to spring, or night turns toward dawn? Suddenly, one is startled: though no smoke is present, it seems as if there is smoke; though no *qi* is present, it seems as if there is *qi*. From the lower *dantian*, it steams up to the heart’s palace, awakening one as if from a dream. This moment of initial awakening is called the *huo zishi* (Living Zi Hour). Swiftly activate the first River Chariot to gather and circulate it; delay, and this formless *qi* will transform into something tangible. This *qi* is called *renqian* (Watery Lead), the postnatal, or the yang fire—hence it is said, “At the *zi* hour, advance the yang fire.” What does advancing the yang fire mean? The practitioner must abruptly turn the newly awakened heart, shifting it past the lower Magpie Bridge to the position just before the Big Dipper. This is the true secret never to be transmitted lightly. Move it to the *weilu* (Coccyx Pass), guarding it without disorder. In an instant, the true *qi* warms gently, passing through the two apertures at the tip of the coccyx, penetrating the spine, ascending to the *yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), and drilling into the *niwan* (Mud Pill Palace). The ancient immortals said: *“Through the double passes of the spine to the crown gate—this is the most revered path in cultivation.”* This is what they referred to. Fools, not understanding the circulation of *qi*, immediately press the tongue to the upper palate to receive the sweet dew. Alas! How laughable and pitiable—all due to not having received proper instruction. Know that in the practice of circulating *qi*, one can only guide the *qi* into the throat. As the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Ingest the mysterious *qi* to attain longevity.”* Thus, this yang fire *qi* is purple-black in color and is called the *xuanqi* (Mysterious Qi). The method of ingestion requires oral instructions to send it into the *qi* pipe. Otherwise, if it enters the food throat, where can the foundation of the elixir be established? One must guide this yang *qi* down the *qi* throat to the *xuanying* (Mysterious Throat), where it transforms into the water of sweet dew. As the *Huangting Jing* says: *“The Mysterious Throat’s *qi* pipe receives the essence talisman.”* This is what it means. The *xuanying* is also called *xuanyong* (Mysterious Obstruction), for when a person’s *qi* reaches this point, it becomes obstructed. Common folk, ignorant of this mystery, expect the *qi* to transform into divine water upon reaching the *niwan*, swallowing it like tea. I fear that even a single drop entering the *qi* pipe would cause unceasing coughing. How could water, a tangible substance, enter the *qi* pipe? Thus, the *Huangting Jing* states: *“Exhaling the clear and inhaling the mysterious, the two *qi* shine—if you encounter this, you will ascend to the Milky Way.”* This means the clear *qi* emerges from the *dantian*, while the mysterious *qi* enters the *xuanying*, the two *qi* transforming into one another. When the *qi* transforms into water, it showers the heart’s palace and returns to the Void Cavity. Treasure and nurture it—this is the foundation-laying. After laying the foundation for a long time, the accumulation deepens, and there comes a moment when, while sitting in stillness as usual, something suddenly emerges from the *dantian* with a sound like thunder and a radiance like lightning—this is the precelestial medicine within the postnatal. Immediately apply the first Chariot to circulate it to the *niwan*, where it first transforms into liquid. Ingesting it, one obtains the *yuye dantou* (Jade Fluid Elixir Head). This is the beginning of obtaining the medicine and congealing the elixir. Thereafter, the work must be continuous and unbroken, deepening the root and securing the stem. This is the subtlety of fully nurturing the elixir; for further details, see the explanation below.\n\nThe second River Chariot, the practice of circulating essence, is for drawing out the lead from Kan (Water) and restraining the mercury of Li (Fire), refining one’s nature. Previously, after circulating *qi* for a long time, one obtained the minor medicine and congealed the elixir head. Thereafter, the internal breath flows naturally and effortlessly, firmly guarding the *dantian*. Each morning, while sitting or lying in clarity, the elixir rises to the heart’s palace like a soft ball of cotton. It must be gathered back into the Void, vanishing without a trace, to prevent its loss. The secret says: *“When the spirit returns to the body, the *qi* naturally follows.”* This is precisely that moment. As the embrace deepens over time, suddenly the *dantian* feels like spring water newly born, rippling and flowing. Guard the natural internal breath, refining and tempering it. The water suddenly transforms into hot *qi*, flowing from the inner sides of both hips to the *yongquan* (Bubbling Spring). The spirit must focus on the heels, the true breath following—this is what is meant by *“the true person’s breath reaches the heels.”* After a short while, when the *yongquan* settles into stillness, return the heart to the *weilu*, silently guarding and awaiting. Suddenly, one senses something at the *weilu*—soft like cotton, like a steamed bun, like a mass of *qi*, heavy and sluggish, difficult to move. Immediately adjust the internal breath, concentrate the mind single-pointedly, and intensely refine it. Then, a stream of hot liquid surges from the *weilu*, slowly passing through the spine and surging up to the *niwan*. Only then is it called the Yellow River flowing backward, the canal reversed in its course.",

      "translated_text": "This type of river chariot is what the *Dadong Jing* calls *\"harnessing essence to reach the Mud Pill Palace,\"* and what Ancestor Lü describes as *\"transporting essence into the upper palace\"*—it is not the same as circulating *qi*. Within the Mud Pill Palace, the sound of rushing water resonates, and after a long while, the water’s sound ceases, and the spirit rests within it. After maintaining this for a short time, press the tongue upward against the palate, hold the breath in the nose, clench the jaw tightly, brace both hands against the seat, and tilt the head back to face the empty beam. Wait until the golden liquid fills the tongue, then hold the nasal breath without exhaling. With a single gulp, it flows into the windpipe, descending the twelve-tiered tower of the *chonglou*, and the divine water irrigates the Flowery Pond.\n\nThis Flowery Pond is unknown to most. Some say it lies beneath the tongue’s root, others claim it is the lower *dantian*—both are incorrect. This Flowery Pond resides between the two breasts, called the upper *qi* sea, separated from the *xuanying* by a single layer. As Bai Yuchan states: *\"The Flowery Pond lies precisely within the qi sea.\"* When the water fills the Flowery Pond, it flows without being retained. Reaching the Crimson Palace, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Settling into the Yellow Court, the heart-fire attains supreme stillness. This is called *\"drawing lead to restrain mercury, guiding the tiger to subdue the dragon.\"* Once the two trigrams are united, they circulate endlessly—this is the work of refining the self with jade liquid.\n\nYet this jade liquid cannot be produced daily; one must first apply the earlier *qi*-circulating practice. After several cycles, it may arise once. When one reaches the stage where jade liquid flows continuously, the Yellow Center becomes pervaded with principle, the skin grows lustrous, the heart-monarch rests in leisure, and the nature-body shines with radiance. Facing circumstances, one forgets emotion; in desire, one transcends desire. Living in the world yet apart from it, the true intent becomes unshakable, the sword’s edge keen. Round and full, luminous and bright, red and pure, gleaming and sharp—this is the time when self-refinement is perfected.\n\nHere, one may proceed to the three chariots’ work, as the following section will explain.\n\n**The Third River Chariot**\nThis involves circulating the primordial essence-*qi*, which the alchemists call *\"mercury welcoming lead,\"* the return of passion to nature, the work of seven reversals and nine returns. Once self-refinement is perfected, the mercury-nature becomes spiritually responsive, advancing and retreating freely, the feminine and masculine adapting to change. Only at this stage can one undertake the great work of return and restoration.\n\nThe seven reversals and return of the elixir begin by taking the already-formed mercury-nature and calling it the inner elixir. Then, entering the chamber and sitting in a circle, one conceals the inner elixir within the hollow void. Above resembles *Qian*, below resembles *Kun*; the nature-side pertains to being, the life-side to non-being. First, one must enter non-being from being, then generate being from non-being.",

Once *Qian* and *Kun* are arrayed, they are called the crucible (the wondrous aperture of being and non-being). The dual functions of *Li* and *Kan* manifest through this.\n\nAt the moment of entering non-being from being, all is silent and still—heart dead, spirit preserved. Soon, one’s own consciousness transforms into things that startle or entice, testing the inner spirit. Then, the demonic generals of the heavens take form as good or evil figures, further testing the inner spirit. If undisturbed by any of these, the primordial spirit remains serene.\n\nAfter a time, a single yang qi arises—like the return of one yang beneath *Kun*’s yin. I then exhale a yin from *Qian*’s palace to welcome it (kidney qi ascending, heart fluid descending, all by nature’s course), called *\"mercury welcoming lead,\"* or *\"the great exchange of Kan and Li,\"* or *\"the ebb and flow of inner and outer yin-yang.\"* Once this flow is established, the Celestial Maiden Taiyi, accompanied by Qiu Lan, presents the feminine sword, plucks it, and sets it as the elixir’s foundation—this is the seven-reversal returning elixir.\n\nWith the elixir’s foundation laid, spirit and qi harmonize. The single yang gradually grows into *Dui*, and the *Kan* male transforms into the *Dui* female (this is the time of metaphors like *\"the moon at Geng,\"* *\"the moon on the Western River,\"* or *\"the crescent moon\"*). Because of these two characters, *Dui* and *female*, alchemists call it the *\"first essence\"* or *\"heavenly water\"* (a classification by analogy—fools who practice blindly do so because they have not met a true teacher).\n\nWhen the alchemist gathers this first essence, it is called *\"drawing passion back to nature.\"* After five thousand forty-eight days, when it returns to the Yellow Way, it resembles the full moon of the fifteenth night, with metal and water in perfect roundness. Within the human body, this is the time when the primordial essence and qi surge in abundance.\n\nAt this stage, the practitioner must swiftly activate the great river chariot, transporting it to the Mud Pill Palace. Soon, a sweet fluid descends into the throat, as large as a sparrow’s egg or grape, neither musk nor honey, yet exquisitely fragrant—this is the nine-return golden liquid great elixir. When the Daoist ingests this golden liquid, it is then called *\"lead entering mercury,\"* *\"metal merging with wood,\"* *\"the posterior heaven returning to the prior heaven,\"* and *\"the infant meeting the maiden.\"*\n\nWhen the infant and maiden meet, they are nurtured day and night. Over time, the organs become visible, inner and outer radiance shines, and within, a true one appears, resembling oneself—this is the infant and maiden giving birth to another infant. One who attains this infant must quietly cultivate and cherish it, moving it from the Valley of Spirit to the Heavenly Valley. Then, one may transcend form, ascend to the assembly of immortals, and merge with the Dao.\n\n*Method for Gathering the Heart*\nWritten by Li Hanxu of Changyi Mountain",

      "translated_text": "Chen Yingning of Wanjian’s Collated *Method for Gathering the Heart* – Preface in Verse\n\nThe *Method for Gathering the Heart* unfolds plainly and directly,\nHeaven rejoices, free from blame or reproach.\nYear after year, tirelessly driving the river chariot,\nThe heart seems laborious yet is truly at ease.\n\nLast night, the spirit soared to pay homage to the Upper Perfected,\nWho sealed me as the Great Perfected of the Teachings of Goodness.\nThe Dao recounted my affairs of four hundred years,\nThree playful descents into the red dust.\n\nClasping the golden elixir, I alone savor its delight,\nYet I share with the assembly of immortals in silent riddles.\nAwakening, I first stir the heart of compassion,\nAnd with my own hand inscribe the *Record of the Jade Ring*.\n\nDistinguishing neither good nor evil, wise nor foolish,\nAll must gather the heart and sit in emptiness.\nOnly by entering profound obscurity does one behold the Dao—\nThe very first step is the finest effort.\n\n*Fundamental Practice in the Method for Gathering the Heart*\n\nThe Dao of nurturing life takes true breathing as its root.\nAs Cao Wenyi said: *“I shall tell you gentlemen the truth:\nThe stem of life has always resided in true breathing.”*\nThese are indeed essential words.\n\nThe initial practice begins with quieting the heart,\nThen sealing the mouth,\nThen regulating the breath (when the heart is still, the qi is level—\nThe unregulated regulation is supreme).\n\nOnce the nasal breath is calm and harmonious,\nClose the eyes and inwardly observe,\nDirecting the spirit to the root of the kidneys, below the Yin Bridge meridian\n(Before the Valley Gate, behind the scrotum).\nAfter a short while, lift the heart-breath upward into the Cavity of Emptiness\n(Behind the navel, before the waist, between the heart and kidneys—\nDo not cling rigidly to this location).\nRest the spirit and settle the breath,\nTaking naturalness as the guiding principle.\n\nIf the heart is too severe, it burns—\nOne must follow its natural course: this is the civil fire.\nIf the heart is too scattered, it chills—\nOne must guard its natural state: this is the martial fire.\nThe civil and martial fires refine and temper,\nTheir wondrous application enduring from start to finish.\n\nWhen the inner breath is even and balanced,\nNeither forget nor force it.\nAt this moment, the heart is like empty space:\nWith breath as its companion, it is not empty;\nWith breath as its follower, it is not void.\nBetween non-emptiness and non-void,\nStillness upon stillness,\nPurity upon purity.\n\nThe breath flows ceaselessly,\nThe heart-spirit silently.\nAt this point, release all things,\nForget both self and others—\nThis is called *boring into profound obscurity*.\n\nWithin profound obscurity, there is qi,\nA single spirit alone awakens—\nThis is true breathing.\nWhen true breathing manifests,\nIt warms the heart with a melting, tingling sensation.\nOne must press it back into the Cavity of Emptiness within the body’s chamber,\nAccumulating and layering it,\nSo that the stem of life grows and yang qi naturally lengthens—\nOnly then can one open the passes and circulate the qi.\n\nConcentrating the spirit and regulating the breath\nAre the fundamental practices.\nConcentrating the spirit means gathering the already-cleansed heart and entering within.\nWhen the heart is not yet clear, do not close the eyes inwardly.\nFirst, encourage and urge oneself,\nDrawing it back,\nCool and serene,\nThen gather it into the qi cavern—\nThis is called *concentrating the spirit*.\n\nSitting in emptiness,\nNeither leaning nor tilting—\nThis is concentrating the spirit in the void.\nRegulating the breath is not difficult:\nWhen the heart-spirit is still,\nThe breath follows naturally.\nI merely guard and follow it,\nIlluminating it with the spirit’s light—\nThis is regulation.\n\nDirecting the breath of the Yin Bridge\nTo meet the heart’s breath within the qi cavern—\nThe spirit resides within the qi,\nSilently focusing on the primordial sea.\nWithout union, they unite of themselves;\nWithout contact, they connect of themselves—\nThis is called *spiritual union across the body’s divide*.\n\nGuard one’s nature, preventing dispersion.\nPreserve the spirit, avoiding dullness,\nThus entering profound obscurity and subtle indistinction.\n\nWhen the spirit halts below the navel, it is called *concentrating the spirit*.\nWhen the qi returns below the navel, it is called *regulating the breath*.\nSpirit and breath interdependent,\nGuarding their natural purity—this is *not forgetting*.\nFollowing their natural purity—this is *not forcing*.\nNeither forgetting nor forcing,\nIn silence and softness,\nThe breath becomes lively and the heart at ease.\nEmploy the *boring* technique,\nTaking emptiness as the heart’s dwelling,\nAnd profound obscurity as the spirit-breath’s homeland.\n\nAfter two or three attempts,\nClarifying again and again,\nSuddenly, heart and breath forget each other,\nSpirit and qi merge—\nUnawares, yang stirs in a flash of enlightenment.\n\n*Miscellaneous Discussions on the Method for Gathering the Heart*\n\nA disciple asked: *“The secret of the Three Vehicles has been fully revealed—\nDoes this not risk heavenly reproach?”*\nHanxu replied: *“I dare not defy heavenly reproach,\nBut hope that people may reform and renew themselves.\nIn all practice, one must first discard the human heart\nAnd seek the heart of the Dao.\nSet aside ordinary breathing\nAnd seek true breathing.\nThen stabilize spirit and qi,\nAnd bore into profound obscurity.\nNone of these stages can be omitted.\nHow could one who enters my Dao remain a petty person?”*\n\n*“In all practice, boring into profound obscurity is the most difficult task.\nYet the primordial qi arises from emptiness—\nOnly with true profound obscurity\nDoes true emptiness exist.\nAlas! First difficulty, then attainment—\nOne must be willing to relinquish the whole self.\nIn the past, I spent seven or eight years in the grotto-heaven\nLearning to bore into profound obscurity,\nAnd only then gained a slight grasp.\nToday’s learners advance swiftly but retreat just as fast—\nHow can they enter the Dao?”*\n\nA disciple asked: *“Master, you transmit the Dao so freely—\nIf an inferior person obtains it and fails in practice,\nWill they not turn and revile you?”*\nHanxu replied: *“Without the ridicule of inferior persons,\nHow could the greatness of my Dao be seen?\nThe Great Dao first requires purifying body and mind,\nRegulating spirit and qi.\nAt its deepest, one must be able to release all things\nAnd bore into profound obscurity.\nOnly with such true effort\nWill true efficacy appear.\nThose who lack effort yet vainly seek results\nWill forever remain without them.\nWhy be troubled by their revilement?”*\n\nA disciple asked: *“As you describe it, can even evil people learn the Dao?”*\nHanxu replied: *“Yes.\nI shall recite the admonition:\n*‘All that came before is like yesterday’s death.\nAll that follows is like today’s birth.’*\nRefrain from all evil,\nPractice all good—\nThen one can transform hell into heaven,\nAnd change black qi into crimson light.”*",

      "original_text": "余有三字诀，修道之士，勤、诚、恒，缺一不可。 但勤矣、诚矣，而结果必归于恒。 孔子曰，人而无恒，不可以作巫医，况道乎？ 儒生习文艺，尚以数年为期，甚至有十年者。 岂修心炼气，反不如读书作文？ 诚乃至阴之象，在《易》为太极，在佛为如如。 孟子曰：“至诚而不动者，未之有也。 不诚，未有能动者也。 ”动对静言，则知诚为阴象。 孔门之道，推至诚如神，论至神无息，皆静中大体、大用，故以诚入静，静心不乱。 以诚入定，定心不移。 以诚守中，中心不偏。 以诚入杳冥，则通微无碍矣。 勤为学业之本，其在于道，更有不勤之勤焉。 养自然之息，定自然之心，无为而为，为而不为。 所谓“绵绵若存，用之不勤”者，真乃勤之至也。 炼睡魔，必用勤字。 跑香打坐，精神倒退，此误用其勤之过也。 善炼睡者，睡而不睡，不睡而瞧，功夫自然不断，神气自然加增。 熬更守夜，反惹睡魔。 《参同契》曰：“寝寐常相抱，觉悟候存亡。 ”能用此诀，自然惺惺不昧。 门人问曰：“陆潜虚仙师云：‘交媾乃太上閟秘之旨’，其诀可得闻乎？ ”曰：交媾者，至阴之本，杳冥之根也。 人能钻入杳冥，方能得成交媾。 我劝人先在虚空中团炼，静之又静，定之又定，无人无我，无无亦无，自然入得杳冥，不交媾而自能交媾，从至阴中生出至阳矣。 交媾之法，先天与后天不同。 先天交媾，以性立命。 后天交媾，以神合气。 故《入药镜》云：“是性命，非神气。 水乡铅，只一味。 ”先天名目，独有一物。 后天名目，则分精、神、意、气、魂、魄、性、情。 若在先天，只炼出一个，就皆有了。 总要从交媾中取出真阳耳。 人身五脏，原有部位，不可移动。 道家云：“乾坤坎离颠倒”，岂心可移于下，肾可移于上耶？ 非也。 所谓颠倒者，乃心肾中之神气耳。 心神俯而下就，肾气仰而上升，神气颠倒，则有形之心肾亦如颠倒，无形之乾坤亦皆颠倒。 颠倒交施，坤中生一阳为坎，乾中生一阴为离。 离女与坎男交施，则如西方之兑女，相接东方之震男。 又将南北移为东西，水火变为金木。 金情木性，称为白虎青龙。 龙交虎，如姹投婴，虎交龙，如婴投姹。 要之，乃性命二物。 命中有性，性中有命，二物乃一物耳。 故紫阳先生曰：“震兑非东西，坎离非南北。 ”人亦可以恍然矣。 儒家、道家，养气各有不同。 养自然之气，可以得生。 养浩然之气，则可生、可死。 古来志士仁人，见危授命，杀身成仁之类是也。 养之之时，纯是义理之心，充乎宇宙，故孟子曰：“其为气也，至大至刚，以直养而无害，则塞乎天地之间，是集义所生者。 ”道家养气，独葆其真，不必见危而早退，不必杀身而早隐。 《易》所谓见机而作，不俟终日之君子也。 道家初功，须养其自然之气。 敢问何为自然之气？ 曰：易言也，其为气也，至小至柔以曲，养而无害，则聚乎虚空之中，是集精所生者。 道家还丹，亦是浩然之气。 其气得手，亦能见危授命，杀身成仁。 古来谓之刀解，究竟有神奇莫测处，变化莫解处，异乎儒家。 或死之后，他处见之，须眉转少，仙客同游，此乃还丹成就，身外有身者。 至人得道，生亦仙，死亦仙，如留形住世，尸解登真之类是也。",
      "translated_text": "I possess a three-word formula for those who cultivate the Dao: diligence, sincerity, and constancy—none may be lacking. Yet though one be diligent and sincere, the ultimate outcome must rest in constancy. Confucius said: *“A man without constancy cannot even be a shaman or physician—how much less can he grasp the Dao?”* Confucian scholars study literature and arts, setting years—even a decade—as their term. How could the refinement of mind and tempering of qi require less than the reading of books or writing of essays?\n\nSincerity is the supreme yin image: in the *Book of Changes*, it is the Supreme Ultimate; in Buddhism, it is *tathatā*. Mencius said: *“There has never been one who was perfectly sincere yet unmoved. Without sincerity, none can move others.”* When “movement” is spoken of in contrast to “stillness,” we know sincerity is a yin image. The Dao of Confucius’ school exalts perfect sincerity as spirit-like, and perfect spirit as ceaseless—both are the great essence and great function of stillness. Thus, entering stillness with sincerity stills the heart without disorder; entering concentration with sincerity fixes the heart without wavering; guarding the center with sincerity keeps the center without bias; entering profound obscurity with sincerity unobstructedly penetrates the subtle. Diligence is the foundation of learning, and in the Dao, there is an even deeper “diligence within non-diligence.” Nurturing the breath of spontaneity, settling the mind of spontaneity, acting without acting, and acting yet not acting—what is called *“subtly continuous as if existing, its use never exhausted”* is truly the utmost of diligence.\n\nTo subdue the demon of sleep, one must employ diligence. Racing incense and seated meditation that exhaust the spirit are misapplications of diligence. Those skilled in refining sleep sleep yet do not sleep, do not sleep yet remain watchful—effort naturally continues unbroken, and spirit and qi naturally increase. Staying up through the night instead invites the sleep demon. The *Cantong Qi* says: *“Sleep and wakefulness ever embrace; vigilance discerns presence and absence.”* Mastering this formula, one remains naturally clear and unwavering.\n\nA disciple asked: *“Master Lu Qianxu said: ‘The union of yin and yang is the Most High’s most secret teaching.’ May we hear its formula?”*\nI replied: The union of yin and yang is the root of supreme yin and the foundation of profound obscurity. Only by boring into profound obscurity can one achieve this union. I advise first refining within emptiness—stillness upon stillness, concentration upon concentration—until there is no self, no other, not even “nothingness.” Naturally, one enters profound obscurity, and without seeking union, union occurs spontaneously, giving birth to supreme yang from within supreme yin.\n\nThe method of union differs between pre-heaven and post-heaven. Pre-heaven union establishes life through nature; post-heaven union unites spirit with qi. Thus, the *Mirror for Ingredients* says: *“It is nature and life, not spirit and qi. The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor.”* Pre-heaven has but a single name; post-heaven distinguishes essence, spirit, intent, qi, hun, po, nature, and emotion. In pre-heaven, refining one suffices—all are present. The key is to extract true yang through union.\n\nThe five viscera in the human body have their fixed positions—none may be shifted. Daoists speak of *“inverting Qian and Kun, Kan and Li,”* but how could the heart be moved downward or the kidneys upward? Not so. What is inverted is the spirit and qi within the heart and kidneys: the heart’s spirit descends to meet, the kidneys’ qi ascends to rise. When spirit and qi invert, even the physical heart and kidneys seem inverted, and the formless Qian and Kun likewise invert. Through inverted exchange, a single yang is born within Kun to form Kan, and a single yin is born within Qian to form Li. The Li maiden and Kan youth exchange, like the Dui maiden of the west joining the Zhen youth of the east. South and north shift to east and west, water and fire transform into metal and wood. Metal’s emotion and wood’s nature become the White Tiger and Azure Dragon. When the dragon unites with the tiger, it is like the maiden embracing the infant; when the tiger unites with the dragon, it is like the infant embracing the maiden. In essence, these are the two of nature and life. Within life is nature, within nature is life—two yet one. Thus, Master Ziyang said: *“Zhen and Dui are not east and west; Kan and Li are not south and north.”* One may now comprehend this.\n\nConfucians and Daoists cultivate qi differently. Nurturing the qi of spontaneity can preserve life; nurturing the qi of vastness can embrace both life and death. From ancient times, the resolute and humane—those who risked danger to fulfill their mission or died to perfect their humanity—did so. When cultivating this qi, it is purely the heart of principle, filling the cosmos. Thus, Mencius said: *“This qi is supremely great and firm. Nurtured with uprightness and unharmed, it fills the space between heaven and earth—it is born of accumulated righteousness.”*\n\nDaoists cultivate qi by preserving their true nature, neither waiting for danger to retreat nor death to hide. They are the *“noble ones who act upon perceiving the moment, not waiting for the day’s end”* spoken of in the *Book of Changes*. In the Daoist initial practice, one must nurture the qi of spontaneity. What is this qi of spontaneity? The *Book of Changes* says: *“This qi is supremely small and soft, bending yet nurtured without harm. It gathers within emptiness—born of accumulated essence.”*\n\nThe Daoist elixir of return is also the qi of vastness. Once attained, it too can face danger to fulfill a mission or die to perfect humanity. Since ancient times, this has been called *“knife liberation,”* possessing unfathomable marvels and inexplicable transformations, distinct from Confucianism. Some, after death, reappear elsewhere with youthful features, traveling as immortals—this is the accomplishment of the returned elixir, a body beyond the body. The perfected who attain the Dao live as immortals and die as immortals, whether leaving their forms behind or ascending through liberation.",

      "translated_text": "The humane can attain stillness—living long, dying long—like Master Zeng preserving his body or Yan Yuan’s brief life. There are five failures on the Dao: some taste and depart; some superficially admire its name; some begin diligently but end in slackness; some, with stubborn natures yet uninitiated, rashly slander its profundity; some, of dull disposition, remain deaf to calls and blind to awakening. There are three attainments on the Dao: those who know it may become spirit-people; those who love it may become perfected people; those who delight in it may become supreme people.\n\n**Postnatal Sequential Exposition Concludes (Volume Three)**\n\nI have written commentaries on the *Dao De Jing*, *Huangting Jing*, *Dadong Jing*, and *Wugen Jing*, all expounding the function of the prenatal, not the gateway for beginners. To journey far, one starts nearby; to ascend high, one begins low. Without clarity on the postnatal sequence, it is like aspiring to become a *jinshi* or *hanlin* without first passing the *maocai* or *xiaolian* examinations. Thus, I composed *Postnatal Sequential Exposition* as the path of entry, comprising nine stages:\n\n1. Gathering the mind\n2. Seeking qi\n3. Congealing spirit\n4. Expanding the apertures\n5. Opening the passes\n6. Laying the foundation\n7. Obtaining the medicine\n8. Coalescing the elixir\n9. Refining the self\n\nThe Most High said: “Nobility takes humility as its root; height takes lowliness as its foundation.” Postnatal cultivation is the Way of the humble and lowly. Humility is what the master calls *“speaking of the unsightly.”* Lowliness is what the *Scripture* calls *“taking from below.”* To nurture the elixir’s foundation, essence and qi are treasured as jewels. In practice, one must first gather the mind inward, taking the center as the pole, harmony as the principle, spirit as the substance (stillness), and intention as the function (wisdom).\n\nSeeking qi begins with the yinqiao vessel, where it is lively and fluid, neither seen nor heard. Harmony is the work of concentrating qi to softness, embracing spirit in stillness. From stillness wisdom arises; seated illumination returns to its origin. Mating primordial essence generates primordial qi, and expanding the apertures to open the passes becomes effortless.\n\nPrimordial essence is the yinqiao meridian’s daily-generated human qi. The practitioner must seek the qi’s active locus and unite it with stillness—this is called the union of spirit and qi. When spirit and qi unite, male and female essences mate, and the true seed is transformed. The true seed is the postnatal crucible’s true qi. The postnatal crucible is where primordial spirit and primordial qi conjoin, hence named the *spirit-father* and *spirit-mother*. When this qi is refined from the crucible, one must congeal the spirit, soften the intention, and use softness to restrain hardness, naturally entering one’s inner crucible. Harmonize, regulate, forge, and refine it, concealing it within the cinnabar field, breathing within the void—this is called the *life-stem* or *embryonic breathing*.\n\nSuddenly, within the inner crucible, something surges forth, leaping and bounding, hissing and puffing, ascending through the thrusting vessel to the heart’s palace—this is the moment of expanding the apertures. When its force is potent, transform spirit into intention, guide it out from the coccyx, striking the three passes to soar to the mud-pill palace—this is opening the passes. Once the passes and apertures are open, proceed with the work of self-nurturance and discuss laying the foundation.\n\nLaying the foundation means drawing their qi and blood to replenish one’s spirit. Though spirit may be robust, fearing its instability, one uses *ren lead* to restrain it. *Ren lead* is born of the union of the two qi. The qi of the *kan* palace is earthly qi; the qi of the *li* palace is heavenly qi. When heaven and earth conjoin, chaos swirls, misty and dense, coalescing into the *Cavern of the Void*. Within the Cavern of the Void, a qi is born—this qi is *ren lead*, the moment of obtaining lead.\n\nLead’s nature is qi without substance, thus it is clear and ascends. Upon reaching Kunlun, direct the gaze upward so spirit and qi rest in the crown. After a time of congealment, yang reaches its peak and yin arises. Then, press the tongue against the upper palate, regulate the breath, and after prolonged contact, sweet nectar descends like cold springs, drop by drop. Though not abundant, swallow it down the *heavy tower*, sending it with intention to the yellow court. Strangely, a sound like crashing waves arises—one realizes celestial sweet dew is not easily obtained. Descending into the yellow court, it coalesces into the inner elixir.\n\nThereafter, one must sever desire while in desire, transcend dust while in dust, forget essence amid circumstances, refine lead to subdue mercury, expel the three corpses and five thieves, and dissolve the six desires and seven emotions. Bones and qi become golden essence; skin and flesh turn to jade. Then, inner celestial mechanisms align with outer human affairs—no deliberation, no insistence, no rigidity, no self. Accumulate merit, refine qi, and nurture spirit; as things arise and events occur, the mind’s realm naturally radiates light. Meeting scenes with the heart, the wisdom-sword cleaves through dusty obstructions. Cultivating merit in the human realm, one’s name resounds in heaven. Feasting on celestial emoluments, one enjoys boundless longevity.\n\nAt this stage, embrace simplicity and guard integrity, vigilant against peril and danger. Heaven and humanity unite in manifestation; the myriad transformations settle their foundation. Spirit is eternally firm; qi returns to the void—this completes the work of self-refinement. Beginners must first gather the mind, seek qi, congeal spirit, expand the apertures, open the passes, lay the foundation, obtain the medicine, coalesce the elixir, and refine the self—these nine stages are the gateway to the Dao. Once entered, yin and yang return to unity, and there is no going without return. Exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny, one moves from effort to effortlessness, from striving to spontaneity—there has never been a case where the golden elixir failed to form.",

      "translated_text": "**Volume Four: Record of Following the Path**\n*(Conclusion of the Scripture on Ninefold Heart Refinement in the Great Dao of Human Primordiality)*\n*Handwritten by Hanxuzi, Master of the Purple Radiance Grotto*\n\n**(Discourse on Ninefold Heart Refinement)**\n\n**First Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the unpurified heart. The unpurified heart teems with delusive thoughts and wandering musings. Delusive thoughts arise from craving and desire; wandering musings spring from unawareness. When practitioners sit in meditation, though they may wish to banish worldly concerns, no sooner are delusive thoughts dispelled than wandering musings arise anew. The method lies in *zhi* (cessation) and *guan* (contemplation), through which they may gradually dissolve and refine. *Zhi* means to cease at the space behind the navel’s hall and before the Gate of Life, slightly below its center, where there is a circle of emptiness and void. The heart ceases there and inwardly contemplates, its illumination shining within the void, guarding the qi. It is bound within the compass and square, moving between the circle and the square, each breath returning to the root, uniting with the natural workings of creation. Immovable as a mountain, it establishes the primordial foundation of purity and stillness. From this, a single thread of heart-light connects with a wisp of true qi, merging in profound vastness, tranquil and at ease—this is the initial work of refining the heart and nurturing qi.\n\n**Second Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart in samādhi. Previously, the single thread of heart-light connected with the wisp of true qi; if it could penetrate directly into profound obscurity, it would naturally emerge through the Mysterious Aperture. Yet the heart in samādhi is not steadfast, often swayed by the *shishen* (discriminating spirit), causing heart and qi to separate, and the original face remains unseen. The method lies in the moment when heart and breath interdepend: extinguish all knowing and awareness. The heart abides within qi yet knows it not; qi envelops the heart yet is not perceived. In a state of misty fusion, they become one—this is the work of refining the heart to unite with qi.\n\n**Third Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the returning heart. Previously, in misty fusion, they became one; beneath the heavy yin, a single yang returns—this is called the heart of Heaven and Earth, the Mysterious Pass. At this moment, essence, qi, and spirit all reside in the primordial, the initial separation of the primordial chaos, undivided into true essence, true qi, and true spirit—yet this *is* true essence, true qi, and true spirit. If the heart can remain unmoving, one may immediately gather and circulate them. Yet, encountering sights unseen and sounds unheard, with wondrous scenes before one, one is at a loss; the heart stirs and falls into the posterior heaven, and essence, qi, and spirit separate. The method lies in the moment the Mysterious Pass first appears: immediately tread the fire-clouds, proceed to the *weilü* (coccyx), steady the heart, soften the breath, strike the iron drum to pass the Three Barriers, and rest upon Kunlun—this is the work of refining the heart to advance qi.\n\n**Fourth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the withdrawing and storing heart. Previously, treading the fire-clouds and passing the Three Barriers, heart and qi followed and entered the *nīwán* (Mud Pill Palace). Yet within the *nīwán* Palace, if the *shishen* stirs, the qi chills and congeals, failing to transform into true water, sprinkle, and irrigate the Three Palaces—all prior efforts are lost. The method lies atop Kunlun’s summit: still the heart and abide in quiescence, merging with qi. The qi then transforms into sweet nectar, descending from the upper palate. Curl the tongue to receive the dew, swallow and guide it, pouring the heart into the *jiàngōng* (Crimson Palace), the *huángtíng* (Yellow Court), and the *yuánhǎi* (Primordial Sea), the sound of its passage resonating all the way down. Wait again for the appearance of the Mysterious Pass—this is the work of refining the heart to obtain qi.\n\n**Fifth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart for foundation-laying. Previously, entering the *nīwán* and returning to the qi cavern, the path of the River Chariot is established. From this, proceed with single-minded devotion, day and night without rest—how can the foundation fail to form within a hundred days? Yet if there is laxity or desire, with starts and stops, the elixir foundation will not solidify. Foundation-laying gathers essence and unites spirit; if effort is not diligent, essence and spirit remain scattered—how can one prolong life and serve the Dao? The method lies in following the *zǐ-wǔ* (midnight-noon) cycle, daily drawing and adding, extracting from *kǎn* (Water) to fill *lí* (Fire), accumulating gold to solidify the abdomen—this is the work of refining the heart to accumulate qi.\n\n**Sixth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the heart to complete nature. Previously, with the River Chariot turning and essence gathered to unite spirit, the numinous root is replete. From this, heart-fluid descends and kidney-qi ascends—this is the union of *kǎn* and *lí*. In profound obscurity, there is a sign, vast as the tide: half is water-qi, misty as fog; half is cloud-qi—this is the initial stirring of metal and water, the stage of refining the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir. If the heart is not single-minded, the task of completing nature remains unfinished. The method lies in the moment when metal and water first arise: from the cinnabar field, they divide and descend to the *yǒngquán* (Bubbling Spring), instantly converging at the *weilü*. Harmonize the true breath, stir and dance it, so it surges upward to the Heavenly Valley; trickling down, it falls into the Yellow Court. Thus, irrigating daily, the heart-ground becomes cool and clear. Blood transforms into cream, intent congeals into earth, and within earth, mercury is born. Mercury’s nature is round and luminous, unchanging in encounter with things—like a spirit-sword in hand. Mencius said, “He who exhausts his heart knows his nature.” Daoists call this the Yin Elixir or Inner Elixir—this is the work of refining the heart to illuminate nature.\n\n**Seventh Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-illumined nature. Previously, the River Chariot of metal and water was called “inner refinement” by the immortals. At this stage, there is still the work of outer refinement. By uniting outer with inner, the true heart gathers and does not scatter. Though the inner body is illuminated, mercury’s nature is prone to flight; though inner refinement is achieved, the Yin Elixir is easily corrupted. If preservation is not pure, the heart-nature is extinguished once more. The method lies in blending the emptily luminous heart and the wondrously existent nature with cinnabar and earth, planting them in that domain.",

      "translated_text": "That domain is empty, yet I fill it with substance; that domain is nonexistent, yet I bring it into being. Casting the existent into the nonexistent, infusing the substantial into the void. The dead heart remains unmoved, and in an instant, the primordial qi emerges from the formless. The first period manifests as one Yang, akin to *Zhen*. The second period manifests as two Yangs, akin to *Dui*. At the moment of the second period, it is precisely the time to conjoin the Elixir. From that side issues a thread of true qi—its metaphor is the tiger born from water. From this side descends a speck of mysterious radiance—its metaphor is the dragon emerging from fire. The two, dragon and tiger, meet in union; nature and destiny intermingle in mutual resonance. A great battle ensues, as though heaven and earth were plunged into darkness, and both body and heart become utterly still.\n\nSuddenly, the three Yangs stir into motion, akin to *Qian*. Like tides, like fire, like mist, like smoke, like thunder, like lightning, like snow, like blossoms—within the body, the Yang lead shines brilliantly. I then wield the sword, grasp the seal, tread the *gang*, pace the *dou*, rousing the primordial harmony. With fierce firing and extreme refinement, it pierces the Three Passes and ascends to the *Niwan*, every pore of the body opening—unlike the earlier Jade Liquid River Chariot. Swallowing and ingesting it, the primordial governs the acquired; nature and destiny merge into one—this is the Great Return. Nature pertains to fire, its number seven. Destiny pertains to metal, its number nine. Returning to the origin and reverting to the source, thus is revealed the seven-return, nine-reversion, and the Golden Liquid Great Elixir. Henceforth, lead comes to restrain mercury, the heart remains ever luminous, and mercury ceases to waver. This is the work of refining the heart to preserve spirit.\n\n**Eighth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-subdued heart to enable communion with spirit. Previously, the seven-return, nine-reversion, with lead restraining mercury, has stilled the heart. Yet it must be warmed and nurtured, so that the qi within the body wholly transforms into spirit, and the spirit within the body can roam beyond. Thus, taking the twelve months of the year, excluding the *mao* and *you* months for bathing, the remaining ten months are for advancing and retreating—hence the term \"ten-month nurturing,\" not implying ten months of effort. Otherwise, though the heart is stilled, it remains inert. Refining and forging it, the numinous heart becomes daily more apparent. Numinous, it moves; moving, it transforms; transforming, it transfigures—thus arises the phenomenon of spirit departing, no longer deluded by worldly sentiments. This is the work of refining the heart into spirit.\n\n**Ninth Stage of Heart Refinement** refines the already-numinous heart to return it to emptiness. Previously, the work of nurturing ran deep, and the spirit, having emerged, is no longer confused. Following the heart’s desire, all is fitting; treading upon clouds and mist, traversing the isles of the sea—such is the joy attained. Yet if the numinous heart is not empty, it cannot embrace the ten thousand existences. Thus arises the necessity of refining emptiness. Refining emptiness, the heart’s vastness expands, and the myriad existences all become nonexistent. A single qi of pure emptiness spirals between heaven and earth. It is I, yet not I; it is emptiness, yet not emptiness. Though the world may perish, only emptiness remains indestructible. Though the cosmos may obstruct, only emptiness knows no hindrance—thus the spirit fills the void, and the Dharma pervades the realms of the sands. This is the beginning and end of heart refinement; nothing surpasses it.",
      "overlap_context": " At this stage, there is still the work of outer refinement. By uniting outer with inner, the true heart gathers and does not scatter. Though the inner body is illuminated, mercury’s nature is prone to flight; though inner refinement is achieved, the Yin Elixir is easily corrupted. If preservation is not pure, the heart-nature is extinguished once more. The method lies in blending the emptily luminous heart and the wondrously existent nature with cinnabar and earth, planting them in that domain.",

      "translated_text": "The immortals take Laozi as their patriarch. In his dealings with the world, Laozi never contended with others. Outwardly, he relinquished glory and splendor; inwardly, he cultivated longevity. Serene, harmonious, settled, and still—non-action in accord with nature. Yet in non-action, all the world’s heterodox arts, restless clamor, bizarre and strange conduct, cunning schemes, and tumultuous deceits are not of Laozi’s teaching. To say \"natural\" is to act and move in accord with feeling and reason, flowing with the transformations of creation. Abiding in the center without bounds, contemplating emptiness without form. Attaining emptiness and preserving stillness, deeply concealed yet seemingly vacant. Neither flaunting the extraordinary nor establishing the peculiar, thus the histories call him an ancient reclusive gentleman. The *Daodejing*’s five thousand words draw upon ancient sayings to establish its discourse. It may be applied to governing the world and cultivating the self. Though we, in our daily reading of the *Daodejing*, may not grasp its profound meaning, in our hearts and conduct, we secretly aspire to emulate it. In the depths of mountains and secluded valleys, two or three like-minded companions keep company, wandering amidst mist and clouds, staff in hand, singing of the sagely transformation—unaware, unknowing, following the patterns of the Emperor on High, using this as a means to conceal our inadequacies.\n\nOne day, while visiting a Daoist abbey, I came upon several volumes of the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, which expounds the learning of extending life without straying from Laozi’s Dao. Among them was the *Thirteen Classics with Annotations*, all works of Laozi. The commentary on the *Daodejing* was the most refined and detailed. Appended at the end was the *Nine Layers of the Path*, even more accessible and plain. I inquired of a Daoist priest, \"Who is the Master of the Tree’s Shade?\" He replied, \"A recluse among farmers.\" Thus, I sought the master at Juanshan, and he deemed me a kindred spirit to [Xu] You and [Ni] Qian. He imparted to me the true mechanism. Upon returning, I had the *Thirteen Classics* printed and placed in bookshops to manifest the master’s compassionate intent. Additionally, copies of the *Daodejing* and *Nine Layers* were printed and distributed to Daoist and Buddhist temples.\n\nThis book is concise in length yet complete in true instructions. For our small circle, it is convenient to practice and study, fulfilling ourselves and others—does not its potential lie herein? Reflecting on the master’s words about accepting disciples, each of us, following the Daoist lineage, established names for ourselves beyond the worldly realm, like streams and rivulets flowing into the great river. Zixia received teachings from Huiweng, and we, as his successors, share a deep connection. Alas! Among the affairs of heaven and earth, those like us few fools neither need nor are able to contend.",

      "translated_text": "At seventy, Daoyu’s years have grown long; Daosheng, too, nears the threshold of old age; and Daohe is no longer young. What joy can there be within these mountain forests? Only that we bear this single commentary on the *Daodejing* and this single chapter of the *Nine Layers*, singing long songs among cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing through the clouds over the streams—each forgetting our surnames and ages.\n\nIn the month of *Nánlǚ* during the *Dūnyīn* year of the Daoguang reign, inscribed by the Three Recluses of Mount Shu.\n\n**Preface by Master Pure Yang**\n\nThe *Daodejing* of Lord Lao teaches \"non-action as action.\" The *Zhengyi* commentary elucidates \"non-doing as doing.\" The Dao Ancestor transmitted it; his descendants expounded it, making the Great Dao ever clearer. Then there is one called Hanxuzi, a transcendent talent: golden script entered his dreams, and he was born into a family beneath the trees. His lineage, dwelling in Juanshan, has long transmitted purity and sincerity. That he was endowed with a jade scepter was only fitting.\n\nFrom childhood, he possessed extraordinary insight; in maturity, he cultivated the mysterious. Once he read the *Fanghu Waishi*, he secretly aspired to ascend to truth and enter transformation, standing beside Master Lu at my side. Hearing of him, I sought him out, assuming the guise of a mountain Daoist. I brought Qianyu with me to observe his resolve. He dwelt in seclusion on the eastern slopes of Mount E, serene and taciturn, indifferent to glory and profit, often contenting himself with a single qin to express his will.\n\nAfter we met, we kept company for years. I often spoke to him of the profound mystery, and he grasped it instantly. Thereupon, he exerted his talent and composed the *Yuanqiao Waishi*, a counterpart to Master Lu’s work. Thus, where Lu has the *Xuanfu Lun*, he has the *Daoqiao Tan*; where Lu has the *Jiuzheng Pian*, he has the *Xuntu Shuo*—all works of pure truth. Yet his most wondrous achievement is his commentary on the *Daodejing*, which serves as an eternal lamp for all ages. He titled it *Donglai Zhengyi*, standing equal to Master Lu’s *Nanhua Fumo*. These two masters may truly be called those who excel in discoursing on Laozi and Zhuangzi.\n\nIn annotating this scripture, there are five faults and three virtues. The five faults are: leaning toward governance of the world, the first; leaning toward cultivation of the self, the second; or knowing the Dao encompasses both self and world yet failing to align one’s words, ultimately straying into side paths, the third; not recognizing that the supreme Dao’s practice requires first pacifying the people and enriching the state to achieve non-action—if one begins by discussing stillness, it will inevitably drift into emptiness, the fourth; not recognizing that the supreme power of virtue demands returning to the root and restoring life to be deemed \"having action\"—if one begins by discussing sagehood and divinity, it will inevitably resemble mere hymns of praise, the fifth.\n\nWhat are the three virtues? Harmonizing inner and outer, the commentary distinguishes primary and secondary, further revealing the scripture’s vast meaning—this is the first virtue. Connecting the lineage’s sprouts and veins, filling gaps and ensuring coherence, so the scripture’s meaning flows unimpeded—this is the second virtue. With true realization in the heart and no Zen obstructions in speech, enabling the scripture’s meaning to shine forth—this is the third virtue.\n\nI have long lamented that the *Daodejing*’s essence remains obscure in the world, wishing to take up my brush and annotate it. Yet to this day, I remain unsatisfied. Now, seeing Hanxu’s work, which possesses the three virtues and avoids the five faults, had it appeared a thousand years earlier, other commentators would have had no need to annotate it, and Daoists would not have had to speak further.\n\nThus, I joyfully undertake its evaluation and annotation, storing it in the famous mountains and transmitting it to scholars of aspiration. The purpose of this evaluation is also to borrow the true meaning of this commentary to supplement what I have not annotated, revealing it through these annotations.\n\n**Poem on the *Donglai Zhengyi***\n\nMaster Huiweng’s preface sets the critique,\nHis own preface further opens the gate to virtue.\nAgain, we see purple qi arriving from Guanzhong,\nDirectly beholding the flourishing descendants of Li’s lineage.\nWishing to guide later generations to share the same path,\nAble to make the primordial Dao ever more revered.\nHow many commentators lack such a work?\nThe treasure case is long guarded, enshrined on Kunlun.\n\n—Sealed by the Jade Pivot Right Minister, Censor of Cultivation and Transgressions in the Great Clarity Grotto Mystery, and Selector of Immortal Affairs, the Mysterious Mystic Daoist of Liaodong, Your Friend Zhang Quanyi, respectfully inscribed at Qingfu.\n\n**Another Poem**\n\nOne commentary can unlock the Dao’s profundities,\nOnce more, purple qi arrives from the east.\nA true scholar, plucking the qin and playing the flute,\nA great debater, expounding the scriptures and discoursing on the Dao.\nI dwell in Fanghu, gazing upon the azure sea,\nYou ascend Yuanqiao, pressing down Penglai.\nToday, seated together by the river pavilion,\nReciting the *Nanhua*, we laugh at our own folly.\n\n—Sealed by the Grand Censor of the Three Clarities’ True Scriptures, Keeper of the Grotto Heavens’ Secret Treasures, Master of Civilized Universal Salvation, Ancestral Master of the Eastern Lineage, Fellow of the Immortal Historians’ Hall, Your Foolish Younger Brother Lu Xixing, respectfully inscribed.\n\n**Another Inscription**\n\nThe Dao resides in the body though the self dwells in clouded mountains,\nProfound and potent, the spirit’s qi is most majestic.\nWriting books beyond the isles of Qingdao and Yanchi,\nQuelling the flames of the cinnabar field in tranquil stillness.\nPeople call him the Great Abbot,\nI playfully dub him the Old Man of the Great Wall.\nRelying on this commentary to fence the *Daodejing*,\nAll scriptures’ words resonate in harmonious realization.\n\n—Respectfully inscribed by the Heavenly Immortal Bai Qiongguan.\n\n**Commentary on the *Daodejing* (*Dongyan Zhengyi*)**\nPurified and bathed in reverence, the Master of Purple Radiance Grotto of Yuanqiao Mountain, Hanxu Sheng, annotates.\nProofread and published by the Dao-following disciples Zhu Daosheng and Li Daoyu at Yueyang Tower.\n**Chapter One**",

Therefore, in nurturing life, the sage is yielding and weak, seemingly placing the self last to seek life. Yet by gradual filling and fulfillment, in truth he places the self first to obtain life. By guarding the center to control the exterior, he seems to cast life aside as if without life. Yet by first forgetting and later preserving, he preserves his life to possess life. All this arises from not privately possessing the Way. Thus the sage’s tranquility and simplicity restore the people’s nature to purity and goodness. The sage’s longevity brings the people’s lives to fullness and longevity. The great Way is without self-interest—yet in this, the sage appears to possess life for himself.

There is the capacity to accumulate blessings and virtue, to establish merit and aid the world. Yet though one begets, one does not possess that which is begotten—emptiness shatters into dust. Though one acts, one does not rely on that action—compassion is vast and boundless. The heart that protects the state and blesses the people persists for a thousand kalpas, ten thousand kalpas, ever thus, yet does not boast of heavenly dominion. This is truly called the mysterious virtue.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eleven**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Uselessness”; Peng’s edition titles it “The Chapter of Utility.”)*\n\nThirty spokes share one hub;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the cart.\nClay is kneaded to make a vessel;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the vessel.\nDoors and windows are cut to make a room;\nwhere it is empty, there lies the use of the room.\nThus, what is present serves as advantage,\nwhile what is absent serves as use.\n\nThe thirty-six spokes of the wheel mirror the movements of the sun and moon. Yet the hub lies at the very center of the cart, through which all axles pass. Hollow within, with spokes converging without—thus the hub is fundamentally empty, yet therein lies the use of the cart.\n\n*Shan*: water mixed with earth.\n*Zhi*: sticky clay, the material of bricks and tiles.\nWhen clay is first shaped, there is no vessel. But once kneaded and fired, it becomes the use of a vessel. A room gains light through doors and windows; without them, it is as if there were no room. Once carved and adorned, it becomes the use of a room. Thus, what is present serves as advantage, while what is absent serves as use.

Thus, carrying valuables invites harm even while traveling. The damage wrought by colors, sounds, flavors, hunting, and goods is such that the sage holds them in contempt.

This is called “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\n\n“Favor is base” means that glory is ever shifting, always subject to decline—thus gain and loss cannot be relied upon. Gaining it is like alarm, losing it is like alarm: whether gaining or losing, one remains vigilant and strives without cease. This is what is meant by “favor and disgrace are like alarm.”\n\nWhat is meant by “regard great calamity as you would your own body”?\nThe reason I have great calamity is that I have a body. Once I have no body, what calamity could I have?\n\nThus, one who values the body as the world can be entrusted with the world;\none who cherishes the body as the world can be entrusted with the world.\nThis passage expounds on valuing calamity, first clarifying that having calamity must lead to being without calamity.\n\nYet the cause of great calamity lies in the present form of the body—thus calamity may befall it. But once the shell is shed and the spirit preserved, calamity cannot touch it. Or if one remains in the world while concealing true qi within, veiling one’s light and obscuring one’s traces—what great calamity could disturb such a one?\n\nThus, one who esteems the body and regards it as the world’s entrusted charge, who does not dare to slight this body of a thousand gold pieces, can be entrusted with the world. This is the lesson Huang Shigong imparted to Zhang Liang. One who preserves the body and regards it as the world’s reliance, who does not reveal his rare and transcendent talents, can be entrusted with the world. This is the admonition Zhang Jiuling gave to the Earl of Ye.\n\nHe who excels at preserving the body excels at governing the self.\nHe who excels at governing the self excels at governing the world.\nConfucius said: “The hibernation of the dragon and snake is for the sake of preserving the body.

      "translated_text": "The invisible is called \"even\"; the inaudible is called \"rare\"; the intangible is called \"subtle.\" These three cannot be exhaustively questioned, so they merge into one. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Vast and boundless, it cannot be named—returning to nothingness, this is called the form without form, the image without image, the state of vagueness. Meeting it, one does not see its beginning; following it, one does not see its end. Holding to the ancient Dao, one governs the present being. To know the ancient origin is called the discipline of the Dao.\n\nThe realm of the unseen and unheard is the Gate of Rarity and Evenness. The Gate of Rarity and Evenness is where nature and emotions reside. Evenness conceals nature; rarity conceals emotion. Thus, it is unseen and unheard. Yet the true intent moves between them, intangible when grasped—hence named \"subtle.\" These three cannot be divided or exhaustively questioned, so they should be blended into one, allowing the three to meet. Above and below correspond to \"closing above and closing below.\" Neither bright nor dark, it is as if existing yet not existing. \"Vast and boundless\" means caution and reverence, like closing above and below, existing yet not existing. Cautious of what one does not perceive, its beginning and end cannot be named. Vague and indistinct, within it there is something—returning to nothingness. This is what is called the form without form, the image without image. Without form or image, this is the state of vagueness. The truth of vagueness has no beginning or end—is this not the primordial qi? The ancient Dao is the original substance. The present being is its current function. Though ancient and present differ, one may hold to the ancient to govern the present, from non-being to being. To know what precedes the primordial origin and extend it to what follows is called the discipline of the Dao. Recording years, months, days, hours, even a single tally or moment—all are disciplines of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Manifesting Virtue”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Preserving Fullness.”)*\n\nThe ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly penetrating—too deep to be known. Precisely because they could not be known, one can only forcefully describe them: cautious as if crossing a river in winter, vigilant as if fearing neighbors on all sides, dignified as if a guest, yielding as if ice about to melt, simple as if uncarved wood, open as if a valley, merged as if turbid.\n\nWho can, within turbidity, wait for clarity through stillness? Who can, in tranquility, await life through prolonged movement? Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness. Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.\n\nFrom ancient cultivators, knowing this subtle and profoundly penetrating Way of governing the self—so deep it cannot be fathomed—they dared not recklessly seek to understand it. Even when describing it, they could only forcefully do so. The seven \"as if\" phrases in this chapter are all descriptive words. What they describe are scenes and images. Who can, within heavy turbidity, patiently await its light clarity? Who can, with tranquil and simple spirit, long await its gradual arising? Waiting and awaiting, one dares not seek excess. Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness—this is not seeking excess. Only by not seeking excess can one uphold constancy. Not creating anew avoids contradicting the true Dao.\n\nWei Boyang said: *\"At the furnace, fix the weights precisely; five parts water are in excess. Taking these two as true, gold outweighs its original state. The third does not enter, and fire accompanies both.\"* This is the Way of not seeking excess and upholding constancy. Could Cloud Teeth Master’s *Triple Concordance* also embody the *Daodejing* of the Supreme One without creating anew?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Sixteen**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this “The Chapter of Returning to the Root”; Peng’s version titles it “The Chapter of Emptiness and Stillness.”)*\n\nAttain utmost emptiness; guard deep stillness. The myriad things arise together, and I observe their return. All things flourish abundantly, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny is called constancy; knowing constancy is called illumination. Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune. Knowing constancy brings acceptance; acceptance brings impartiality; impartiality brings kingship; kingship brings heaven; heaven brings the Dao; the Dao brings enduring. To the end of one’s days, one will not be imperiled.\n\n\"Attain\" means to place. \"Emptiness\" is an empty vessel. \"Utmost\" means fulfilling its Way. \"Guard\" means to reside. \"Stillness\" is non-action. \"Deep\" means careful and unwavering. \"The myriad things arise together\" means all things have a beginning. \"I\" is the master of all things. \"Observe\" means to await. \"Return\" means to revert.\n\nThe cultivator places the primordial spirit within the empty vessel, thus obtaining its Way. Having obtained the Way, one should reside in a quiet, inactive place, carefully and unwaveringly preserving it. Awaiting the empty vessel’s generation of things, one then awaits their return to the root. Thus, going forth and returning, life transforms and spirit becomes luminous. Knowing this, the Way of seven returns is complete.\n\nThe myriad things flourish abundantly and arise together, moving from non-action to action, from action back to non-action, still able to follow the mechanism of transformation in their comings and goings. Thus, spring’s birth, summer’s flourishing, autumn’s gathering, winter’s storing—withering and falling, they return to their root. Things return to their root, moving and then still—hence called stillness. Stillness means returning to nothingness and reverting to creation—hence called returning to destiny. Returning to destiny, one knows the true constancy of the Way. Constancy in stillness can constantly respond. Serene, it becomes profoundly clear—hence knowing constancy is called illumination.\n\nPeople of the world, not knowing the true constancy of the Way lies in returning to the root and destiny, engage in reckless endeavors, sinking into the forms and names of action, depleting their spirit. Thus, reckless action brings misfortune.",

When clarity and artifice are employed to scrutinize and seek, the feelings of the people become ever more deeply concealed—just as when cunning and mechanism are used to probe and extract, the medicinal substances grow ever more adept at mutual concealment.\n\nWithin the court, filial piety and compassion serve to harmonize the disharmony of the six relations, just as entering the chamber to cultivate serenity serves to still the restlessness of the six senses. When the state has loyal ministers, they serve to rescue it from benightedness and chaos—just as when the Mysterious Gate holds true gold, it serves to rescue from decline and exhaustion.\n\nThen it laments the pristine and unadorned governance of the ancient age, and the cultivation of the highest virtue through non-action—how distant its wind has become, how long it has been lost.\n\n**Chapter Nineteen**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this \"The Return to Simplicity Chapter\";

Thus the good person fully illuminates the luminous virtue; even the unvirtuous person, by drawing near, also partakes of luminous virtue. The unvirtuous person, unaware of self-reflection, is seen by the good person, who then reflects inwardly. They alternately take each other as teachers, alternately rely on each other. If one does not regard mutual reliance and mutual teaching as precious and beloved, then self-proclaimed cleverness, though possessing wisdom, is still like profound delusion. The essential subtlety of self-cultivation lies nowhere beyond this.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eight**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Returning to Simplicity\"; Peng’s version titles it \"Constant Virtue\")*\n\n\"Know the masculine, guard the feminine,\nand become the world’s stream.\"\nBecoming the world’s stream,\nconstant virtue does not depart,\nreturning to the state of infancy.\n\nThis passage holds two meanings, both of which cultivators of the body should know and uphold.\n\nFirst: the masculine emits, the feminine transforms.\nAs the *Cantong Qi* states:\n\"The masculine yang spreads its dark emanation,\nthe feminine yin governs the yellow transformation.\"\nKnowing this, one can emit and act;\nguarding this, one can transform and nurture.\nWhen feminine and masculine interact,\nmetal is concealed within water,\nand in turn water generates its metal.\nWhen the metal qi is sufficient, the tidal signal arrives—\nits force like a canal stream.\nFlowing backward and ascending,\nit becomes the world’s canal stream.\nYet though it is a canal stream,\nwith yang fire advancing and yin tally arriving,\nthe constant virtue of returning to the root and reviving life cannot be abandoned.\nThus it returns to the earthen cauldron to nurture the fetal infant.\n\nSecond: the masculine returns, the feminine conceals.\nAs the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"Within the masculine, the feminine nurtures the sacred embryo.\"\nIf discussing the principle of generating things,\nwhen yin reaches its extreme, yang arises—\nthis is the feminine harboring the masculine.\nIf discussing the practice of nurturing things,\nwhen yang reaches its extreme, yin arises—\nthis is the masculine harboring the feminine.\nWhen the masculine harbors the feminine,\nhaving obtained the masculine’s return to conjoin the elixir,\none must further rely on the feminine’s concealment to warm the elixir.\nIts force is like a ravine—\nflowing from above downward,\ndescending into the stream.\nThus the way of guarding the feminine\nis like the world’s ravines,\npossessing flow and return.\nThis is the true, constant primordial virtue,\nwhich cannot depart from its place.\nReturning to the stream\nis like returning to the Yellow Court.\nReturning to the state of infancy\nmeans entering stillness to nurture the sacred embryo.\n\n\"Know the white, guard the black,\nand become the world’s model.\"\nBecoming the world’s model,\nconstant virtue knows no error,\nreturning to the boundless.\n\nHere the sage exhausts the principles of feminine and masculine\nand reveals their subtleties,\nagain borrowing color imagery to discuss them.\nThe white is metal essence;\nthe black is water’s foundation.\nMetal essence is the masculine yang,\nspread into the feminine to generate it.\nBefore this essence existed,\nthe Kun mother’s body was originally empty.\nThrough exchanging radiance with the Qian father,\nKun became replete and formed Kan.\nOnce the Kan form was complete,\nthe moon emitted the Dui trigram—\nthis is called metal within water.\nMetal within water\ntruly relies on the Kun mother’s nurturance to form,\nhence it is called the mother qi.\nAs the *Wuzhen Pian* says:\n\"Extracting the white from the black makes the elixir mother.\"\nThe mother qi possesses white light,\ncalled yang light.\nWhen yang light appears,\none moves one’s own mercury to welcome it—\nthis is the \"second phase of seeking the medicine.\"\nWhen both correspond,\nthe two eights of the same kind,\ncaptured in one moment,\nrefined into yang elixir—\nthis is the elixir mother.\nYet its transformation occurs externally,\nso the elixir mother counts only as external medicine.\nThe practitioner uses external medicine to cultivate internal medicine,\nusing mother qi to subdue child qi.\nWithin the elixir mother,\nyang lead is produced—\none then harnesses the river chariot to transport it,\nreversing its course back to the original palace,\nconcealing it in the earthen cauldron.\nWith the four phases harmonized\nand the three families in joyous union,\nthis moment of bliss attains immortality.\nThough the method’s workings are thus,\nknowing the white must first involve guarding the black;\nguarding the black enables knowing the white;\nknowing the white still requires guarding the black.\nWithin this lie three layers of marvelous function,\nsufficient to serve as the world’s model.\nIf one can practice accordingly,\nthen natural constant virtue will know no error.\nHaving no error,\none can return to verify the boundless\nand refine spirit to return to emptiness.\n\nKnowing the white must involve guarding the black:\nyang enters within yin.\nGuarding the black enables knowing the white:\nyin produces yang within.\nKnowing the white still requires guarding the black:\nspirit returns and qi conceals.\nThe principles of heaven, earth, and the myriad things\nare all thus.\nHence it serves as the world’s model.\n\n\"Know glory, guard disgrace,\nand become the world’s valley.\"\nBecoming the world’s valley,\nconstant virtue is thus fulfilled,\nreturning to simplicity.\n\nWhen simplicity scatters, it becomes vessels;\nthe sage employs them,\nthen becomes an official or leader—\nthus great governance does not sever.\n\nFollowing the world to become human is a glorious matter.\nReversing the course to become immortal is a disgraceful matter.\nYet one should know the glory of becoming human\nand guard the disgrace of becoming immortal.\nThe study of constant disgrace is the study of cessation.\nEmptying the heart and nurturing qi,\none becomes like the world’s empty valley.\nAble to contend for the world’s empty valley,\nthen the constant virtue of attaining emptiness and guarding stillness\nis thus fulfilled.\nWith constant virtue fulfilled,\none returns to verify primordial simplicity\nand reverts to the root to return to the origin.\nThe true essence of primordial simplicity,\nscattered and seen, generates the myriad things.\nThe flourishing abundance\ncan all have their materials taken and fashioned into vessels.\nIf the sage wishes to employ these vessels,\nthey become officials of yin and yang,\nleaders of the multitudes,\npreserving and uniting them to return to the One.\nThus great governance of the world\ndoes not esteem division.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Non-Action\"; Peng’s version titles it \"The Sacred Vessel\")*\n\n\"Those who would take the world and act upon it,\nI

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-One**\n\nFine weapons are instruments of ill omen—some things abhor them, and thus those who embody the Dao do not dwell in their presence. Therefore, the noble person in repose values the left, but in warfare values the right. Weapons are instruments of ill omen, not tools for the noble person. When their use is unavoidable, tranquility is paramount. To triumph yet not glorify it—those who glorify it delight in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter cannot realize their ambitions under heaven.\n\nThus, auspicious affairs honor the left, while inauspicious affairs honor the right. For this reason, the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—positioned as in mourning rites. When the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites.\n\nThe term *fine* (佳) implies auspiciousness, yet fine weapons are called inauspicious—how then can weapons be esteemed? The harm of warfare is abhorred by all things, for its schemes are endless and its disturbances manifold. How could one who embodies the Dao claim the name of a lover of war? Thus, the noble person in the world, when at peace, values the left—for the left is auspicious. In warfare, they value the right—for the right is inauspicious. This further reveals the ill omen of weapons.\n\nWeapons are not the tools of the noble person, yet when their use is unavoidable, rescuing the distressed is paramount. Do not act with impatience or fervor; remain serene and detached. Even if victory is achieved and triumphant return secured, never regard warfare as a glorious affair. Those who do so must delight in slaughter. How could such a person be allowed to realize their ambitions in court or wage war across the land?\n\nObserving human affairs, one cannot but sigh: auspicious affairs honor the left, inauspicious affairs honor the right. The left pertains to yang and life, the right to yin and death. Thus, in the military, there are supreme generals and deputy generals. The deputy general, without the supreme general’s command, dares not attack or kill—hence their position on the left, which holds the intent of life. The supreme general, bearing the intent of death, stands on the right. The right is the place of mourning rites, and nothing under heaven is more inauspicious. Thus, the supreme general is positioned as in mourning, cautioned against reckless killing.\n\nAlas! A single general’s success is built upon countless bones—such a thing is cause for bitter weeping. Therefore, when the slain are many, mourn them with sorrowful tears; when victory is won, observe it with mourning rites. The heart of the highest sage is the heart of heaven and earth, which cherishes life.\n\n*(This chapter’s metaphor suggests that the \"female crucible\" is inauspicious and should not be employed. Yet its critique of warfare’s harms is profoundly incisive.)*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\n\nThe Dao is eternally nameless and uncarved. Though small, none under heaven dare subjugate it. If lords and kings can guard it, the ten thousand things will naturally submit. When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends—no command is given, yet it falls evenly of itself.\n\nOnce names are established, they too must know their limit; knowing the limit is how one avoids peril. The Dao in the world is like valleys to rivers and seas.\n\nThe great Dao is without name or form, a single mass of undifferentiated simplicity. Like the Limitless, though the uncarved block is small, it resides above the Supreme Ultimate—how could it be controlled or diminished? If lords and kings guard this simplicity, the great system remains unsevered, and the ten thousand things come as guests.\n\nWhen earth rises to heaven, heaven and earth harmonize, and sweet dew descends. No effort is required to achieve balance—spirit and qi naturally attain equilibrium. When qi transforms into liquid, it is first called the \"golden liquid returning elixir.\" Once the name \"golden liquid\" is established, it must be halted at the earthen crucible and nurtured. Knowing the limit avoids peril; embracing oneness and emptying the heart, peace naturally prevails.\n\nThis Dao, extended to the world, is like valleys to rivers and seas—it has its place of return.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nto know oneself is clarity.\nTo overcome others is to have strength;\nto overcome oneself is to be mighty.\nTo know contentment is wealth.\nTo act with perseverance is to have resolve.\nTo not lose one’s place is to endure.\nTo die yet not perish is to attain longevity.\n\nOne who understands others possesses wondrous wisdom;\none who understands their original nature attains perfect clarity—\nfor they have comprehended their inherent nature.\nOne who overcomes the desires of others has steadfast power;\none who overcomes the corpse-thief within possesses true might—\nfor they have comprehended their destiny.\nTo know contentment is to guard wealth and halt the fire to nurture the elixir.\nTo act with perseverance is to have resolve, like facing the wall for nine years.\nTo attain once is to attain forever, enduring as long as the earth.\nTo die in heart yet preserve the spirit is to live as long as heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"The Task of Completion\";\nPeng’s version titles it \"The Flow of Achievement\")*",

former.\n\nThe person of highest virtue shows no sign of virtue,\nyet possesses its full measure.\nThe person of lesser virtue clings to the name of virtue,\nyet becomes one without virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue does not act as virtue—\nit abides in non-action,\nletting the myriad things transform themselves without purpose.\nThe lesser virtue does not lose virtue—\nit delights in action,\nstirring the hearts of the people toward purpose.\n\nWhat benevolence does is love.\nThe world delights in it—\nthus it has no purpose.\nWhat righteousness does is awe.\nThe world is moved by it—\nthus it has purpose.\n\nYet benevolence is but one benevolence,\nrighteousness but one righteousness.\nAs for propriety—\ncourt rituals change, rural customs differ—\nenforcing it is most difficult.\nIf one forces compliance, the people do not respond,\nand instead roll up their sleeves in contention,\nclinging to their own ways.\nWill not the affairs of the world grow ever harder?\n\nThe great Dao does not contend,\nyet it makes the people not contend—\nhow superior this principle!\nBut once lost, it becomes benevolence;\nlost again, righteousness;\nlost once more, propriety.\n\nThe lament that follows speaks of the turning of the times,\nnot that benevolence and righteousness are partial.\nPropriety, rooted in loyalty and trust,\nwhen customs thin, invites disdain and chaos—\nonly propriety can restore simplicity.\n\nForesight is the radiance of the Dao’s nature,\nyet when its brilliance flames, it breeds folly—\nsuch is the shift in foresight.\nTherefore, the great person stands in the thick, not the thin;\ndwells in the real, not the flowery.\nDiscarding and choosing rightly,\none may say simplicity still lingers among people.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 39**\n\nOf old, those who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear;\nEarth attained the One and became stable;\nspirits attained the One and became

When the nature of things reaches this state, it unites with the Great Harmony.\n\nNow, speaking in terms of the elixir method: when Kun (Earth) joins with Qian (Heaven/Metal), it transforms into Kan (Water). The body of Kan is outwardly empty yet inwardly replete; thus, one should embrace its qi with *chong xu* (penetrating emptiness), like the misty harmony of the Great Harmony.\n\nWhat people despise—being orphaned, widowed, or unprosperous—kings and lords take as their titles. Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or augmented yet lose. What others teach, I also teach: \"The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural end\"—I take this as the father of my teaching.\n\nNothing is more despised than base names, yet \"orphaned,\" \"widowed,\" and \"unprosperous\" are such names, and kings and lords use them to refer to themselves. Though their titles are diminished, in truth, they gain thereby. Thus, observing things, one sees that gain may turn to loss, and loss may yield gain—this is known through contemplating the Way of the *Yi*.\n\nIn the *Pi* hexagram, Heaven is above and Earth below; to transform this into benefit, the Way of Heaven does not dare exalt itself. Thus, it diminishes above to augment below, and the stagnation of Heaven and Earth not joining may become the benefit of the above descending to the below. Therefore, the noble person uses this to reform faults and amend errors.\n\nIn the *Tai* hexagram, Earth is above and Heaven below; to know the good of diminution, the Way of Earth does not presume to be full. Thus, it diminishes below to augment above, and the harmony of Heaven and Earth joining also follows the principle of the above acting through diminution. Therefore, the noble person uses this to curb anger and restrain desires.\n\nHeaven and Earth gain through loss—thus, employing gain is not as effective as employing loss. Though the two hexagrams stand side by side, one should emulate the side of *Sun* (Diminution). Moreover, when *Shan Ze Sun* (Mountain and Marsh Diminishing) is inverted, it becomes *Feng Lei Yi* (Wind and Thunder Benefiting). The resonance of mountain, marsh, wind, and thunder arises precisely from diminution.\n\nThis is the teaching—the teaching of the *Yi*, the teaching of the ancients.

      "translated_text": "The unskilled serve as the resource for the skilled—thus, the strong and overbearing are called the \"teaching fathers.\" The strong and overbearing are those who seize and plunder, diminishing others to augment themselves, yet in the end gain nothing. *Fu* (father) here shares the same pronunciation as *fu* (beginning), read in the rising tone.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Three**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Partial Application\"; Peng’s edition titles it \"Utmost Softness\")*\n\nThe softest under Heaven gallops through the hardest under Heaven. The non-existent enters where there is no gap—thus do I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few under Heaven can attain this.\n\nThe \"utmost soft\" refers to *qi* and water. *Qi* reaches every unobstructed aperture; water finds every unblocked path—thus they gallop through the hardest without gap. Mountains disgorge stones; springs pierce mountains—this is visible. The \"non-existent\" refers to that without form or substance, only *qi* and water, which can likewise reach our bodies and enter where there is no gap.\n\nThe first two lines speak generally of *qi* and water under Heaven; this line refers specifically to the body, setting forth the analogy. It further states: \"Thus do I know the benefit of non-action.\" Non-action means no forced movement, only natural surging. To unite the teaching without words with the benefit of non-action—truly, none under Heaven can match this.\n\n**Chapter Forty-Four**\n*(He Shanggong’s commentary titles this \"Establishing Admonitions\"; Peng’s edition titles it \"Valuing the Name\")*\n\nWhich is closer—name or self?\nWhich is greater—self or wealth?\nWhich is more harmful—gain or loss?\n\nTherefore, excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss. Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures.\n\nThe self is closer than the name; the self is greater than wealth. Gaining the self brings no harm; losing the self brings harm. This principle is self-evident.\n\nThus, the Most High uses \"which is closer,\" \"which is greater,\" and \"which is more harmful\" to awaken people, stirring their innate conscience so they may realize for themselves—not like later generations’ didactic texts, which merely reproach and instead provoke resistance. This is the Most High’s humility and harmony.\n\nYet in the world, some grow close to their name while estranging their self, amass wealth while diminishing their self, value gain over the self, and feel no pain at its loss. Such deep delusion stems from prizing fame and profit while neglecting self-preservation.\n\nHow pitiful when the last breath is drawn, the final hour arrives, the name vanishes into nothingness, wealth becomes an empty fiction, and the lost one falls into ghostly realms, never to regain human form!\n\nFor one living in the world, what builds my name depletes my spirit; what enters through perversity exits likewise—this is what is meant by \"excessive attachment incurs great expense; hoarding leads to heavy loss.\" Attachment that incurs great expense is disgrace; hoarding that leads to heavy loss is danger—neither is a path to endurance.\n\nWith a heart of compassion, the Most High speaks to awaken and teach: \"Knowing contentment avoids disgrace; knowing when to stop avoids danger—this is how one endures.\" Such is the virtue of the sage.",

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nIt is said that those who skillfully nurture life walk on land without encountering rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without being harmed by weapons. The rhinoceros has nowhere to thrust its horn, the tiger nowhere to place its claws, and weapons nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this so? Because they dwell not in the realm of death.\n\nAll things emerge into life and enter death, all falling within the thirteen. As for these thirteen, past commentaries have not grasped their true meaning, which I now clarify. The number ten represents the generative numbers of Heaven and Earth. One Heaven, one Earth; one *qian*, one *kun*. The *qian* hexagram has three yang lines, the *kun* hexagram three yin lines. All things meet the three yang and are born, meet the three yin and die. Only humans, in receiving life, share the three yang with other beings, yet their entry into the three yin is self-accelerated. The seven emotions and six desires greatly harm the original spirit, hence it is said they \"move toward the realm of death.\" Yet even this self-acceleration returns to the three yin alone.\n\nWhy do beings and humans have three births and three deaths? When the pursuit of life is excessive, the dead are extinguished, and the living are replenished. The dead are at rest, the living in motion—this is the cyclical, interdependent pattern. Otherwise, if there were life without death, the teeming multitudes would fill the world; how could there be a place of repose?\n\nThough the death of all things lies in winter and their birth in spring, their life and death are but the alternation of movement and stillness. For humans, however, death does not return to life. This is not because creation singles out humanity for harsh treatment, but because they do not know how to nurture life, thus continually entering the realm of death.\n\nThe Supreme Lord possesses the virtue of cherishing life, and the sage possesses the method of nurturing life. If one seeks wisely, one should transform the path of \"yang birth and yin death\" into the work of \"yang departing and yin arriving,\" thereby attaining long life and enduring vision, no longer sharing the fate of those who, though newly born, move toward the realm of death.\n\nThings are born through three and die through three. The Way of nurturing life thus takes the three yang of the *qian* hexagram and plants one yang within the three yin, so that *kun* becomes substantial and forms *kan*. The three yin of the *kun* hexagram sprout one yin within the three yang, so that *qian* becomes hollow and forms *li*. *Kan* and *li* are the medicinal substances. Entering seclusion and cultivating stillness, one observes the return of one’s solitary yang, then gathers and returns it, gathers and subjugates it. Thus nurturing life is the Way of the Returned Elixir, the work of returning to the root, the art of extending life, the secret of becoming an immortal.\n\nTo reverse and return is nurturing; to move from below to above is nurturing; to turn from outer to inner is nurturing; only with the Yellow Dame within can one nurture. Nurturing is not easily spoken of. Mother and child cherish each other, and nurturing runs deep; the infant and maiden unite, and joy is great; lead and mercury conjoin, and the sacred embryo forms; through non-doing, one verifies and the yang spirit emerges. Though tigers, rhinoceroses, and weapons may assail, they have no power to bring calamity. How then could one share the three yang for birth and three yin for death with ordinary people and things?\n\n**Chapter Fifty-One**\nThe Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes them, things shape them, and conditions complete them. Therefore, all things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise not by command but always naturally.\n\nThus the Dao gives them life, virtue nourishes, rears, raises, completes, ripens, tends, and shelters them. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.\n\nThe Dao sows things, virtue protects them; thus things are born by the Dao and nourished by virtue. Things manifest form, and through conditions they are completed. All things revere the Dao and honor virtue because the Dao is nameless while virtue has a name. The reverence for the Dao and the honor for virtue arise without command, for the principles of things naturally converge.\n\nOnly the Dao presides over their birth, only virtue presides over their nourishment. It rears and raises, completes and ripens, tends and shelters. Preserving and protecting the spirit are all the arts of virtue. Not possessing, not relying, nor dominating, accomplishing through non-doing—this is true understanding. Profound virtue is the highest virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Two**\nThe world has a beginning, which serves as the mother of the world. Having attained the mother, one knows her children. Having known the children, one again guards the mother, and to the end of life one does not perish.\n\nBlock the openings, shut the gates, and to the end of life one will not toil. Open the openings, aid one’s affairs, and to the end of life one will not be saved. Seeing the small is called clarity, guarding the soft is called strength. Use its light, return to its clarity, and one will leave no calamity for the self. This is called inheriting the constant.\n\nThe Way of the world has an end and thus a beginning, yet its beginning is not singular. The Golden Elixir has a place from which it first emerges, a practice with which it first proceeds, and a substance to which it first returns.\n\nWhat is the place of first emergence? The *kun* furnace and the yin furnace are one. Yin conceals yang, hence it is called the yin-yang furnace. The moon appears in the *dui* direction, hence it is called the inverted moon furnace. *Dui* is the youngest maiden, hence it is called the primordial wondrous tripod. The *Awakening to Reality* calls it the \"source of medicinal production\"—all are places of beginning.\n\nWhat is the practice of first proceeding? To reach the utmost emptiness, to guard perfect stillness, I observe their return. Turbidity settles and slowly clears; tranquility endures, and slowly life emerges—all are the first practices.\n\nWhat is the substance of first return? The undifferentiated and complete, the profound and obscure—within it there is sincerity, within it there is essence. The uncarved block without name, the formless gold—all are the first substances. The Returned Elixir takes this gold as its beginning, hence it is said to have a beginning. Yet this gold is not a native substance of the *kun* household; it is the fiery essence of the *qian* household.\n\nThe elixir method takes cinnabar as its primary agent. Entering the *kun* furnace, it forms *kan*, harmonizing with the mercury of the Jade Pond to become *wu* earth—*wu* earth is the yang elixir.",

      "translated_text": "The yang elixir is the external elixir, and the external elixir is the root of the elixir. The Golden Flower is it, the True Seed is it, the Yellow Sprout is it, the White Snow is it. Taking the external elixir as the mother of the internal elixir, thus it is said to have a beginning as the Mother of All Under Heaven. The mother has a sacred name, called Yang Lead. Where there is Yang Lead as mother, there is Yin Mercury as child. Yin Mercury is the postnatal qi of the child, while Yang Lead is the prenatal qi of the mother. When the external Yang Lead subdues the internal Yin Mercury, mother and child meet—hence it is said, \"Know the child.\"\n\nYet this coming of Yang Lead requires the wondrous application of fire. For Lead is born in the *kan* palace, sunken and unmoving. To capture and restrain the true Mercury of the *li* palace, one must employ fierce fire for intense refinement, whereupon it soars upward. After meeting with true Mercury, one should then guard the city and bathe, refraining from applying fierce fire. At first, the mother comes longing for the child; later, the child lingers longing for the mother—thus it is said, \"Having known the child, return to guard the mother.\" When mother and child long for one another without end, the Great Elixir is accomplished.\n\nThe Great Elixir is called the internal medicine; the Sacred Embryo is this, the Infant is this, the True Person is this. In nurturing the internal elixir, one must possess the natural true fire, continuously simmering within the earthen crucible, and also employ the external furnace’s yin-yang talismanic fire, diligently adjusting its intensity. Through the operations of withdrawal and addition, form is transformed into qi, and qi into spirit. When form and spirit are both wondrous, they unite with the Dao in truth. Thus one must block the *dui*, close the gate, and devote oneself to this practice for life.\n\nThere are two kinds of nurturing: the internal civil fire and the external talismanic fire. Preserving it for ten months, one abandons effortful action to realize effortless action—hence one dare not busy oneself with external affairs, disturbing the inner stillness of the chamber. As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"Securely seal their juncture, striving to make it complete and firm. Observe and attend with utmost care, carefully regulating warmth and coolness. Circulate through the twelve nodes, and when each node is exhausted, renew your closeness.\" This is the work of nurturing.\n\nThe inner realm does not leak outward, the outer realm does not intrude inward—blocking the *dui* and closing the gate is the essential technique. If one does not block the *dui*, one will daily engage with external affairs. Daoists often discuss worldly matters, wishing to aid external endeavors, yet first harming their inner cultivation. When the mouth opens, spirit and qi scatter; when the mind is disordered, the fire’s work grows cold. The great path of longevity, I fear, will not be achieved—hence it is said, \"If you assist in such affairs, you will never recover for life.\"\n\nThe \"small\" refers to the golden light of the elixir, its form like a grain of millet—thus it is called \"small.\" To see this small is called \"bright.\" The \"yielding\" refers to the body’s royal water, whose qi is fundamentally harmonious—thus it is called \"yielding.\" To guard this yielding is called \"strong.\" The \"light\" is spirit, the very golden light. The \"bright\" is qi, the very golden essence. When golden light envelops golden essence, light and brightness are concealed within, spirit and qi interdependent. The work of embryo nurturing is accomplished, and the body escapes calamity—thus it is said, \"Use its light, return to its brightness, leaving no misfortune for the body.\" This is the Way of inheriting the constant, the cultivation of long life and enduring vision.\n\nTo \"inherit the constant\" is to guard one’s true constancy. My mountain appraisal: This chapter is clarified sentence by sentence, each word extracted with precision—the Way of the Returned Elixir is fully revealed here.

For their understanding runs deep, and though the heart wishes to speak, the mouth cannot keep pace. If one merely exalts speech, claiming some immortal’s scripture or true transmission has exhausted all that needs to be said—no teacher’s guidance required, the Dao can be practiced—how can they know that while the truth is indeed true, its subtle details, its layered metaphors, its profound mechanisms may yet elude them? Moreover, ascending to truth and entering the Dao ultimately depend on the *returned elixir*. Only when the principle of the returned elixir is clear can one attain the Dao.\n\nNow, let me ask you:\n*Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Dui*—what trigrams are these?\nDragon and tiger, mercury and lead—what alchemical substances are these?\nGuest and host, female and male—how are they distinguished in function?\nThe indistinct and the obscure—how are they embodied?\nThe floating and the sinking, the inverted and the upright—how are they arranged?\nWithout clarity on the *mysterious female*, one cannot engage in transformation.\nWithout summoning the *Yellow Dame*, how can union be achieved?\nBeyond this, words are hard to convey,\nauthority hard to establish,\nthe primary scripture hard to find,\nthe firing times hard to grasp.\n\nFurthermore, as the ancients said: *The great matter of the golden elixir must be pursued with the help of one who has power.* Where in which book is the wondrous use of such a powerful one recorded? Moreover, the practice and discipline of the work include elements that cannot be conveyed by books alone: cutting off sensual desire,轻财利, relinquishing affection, guarding virtue—these are all matters of personal cultivation, not things that can be resolved through texts.\n\nOnly when a sincere heart seeks the Dao,\nmoving heaven above,\ndissolving worldly thoughts,\nand receiving the silent aid of the numinous,\ncan one come to know the Dao.\nTo seek a steed by following a picture—how can this suffice to grasp its subtleties?\nThus, *those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know*—because there are things that are difficult to speak of.\n\nSome may ask: *\"If knowing is indeed difficult to speak of, how can those who are yet unenlightened come to hear of it? Must there not be those who can speak to guide their knowing?\"* The alchemical classics say: *Only with a teacher’s oral instructions can one attain the Dao.* This seems to imply that those who know must speak, and those who speak must know. Let me explain further.\n\n*Oral instructions* are intimate words, subtle words—layer upon layer of breakthroughs, not mere isolated phrases or a few sentences. When the Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, they spoke in detail for three days. When my teacher met Ancestor Zhong, they sat in discussion for ten days. Even for those of heavenly sincerity and the highest spiritual capacity, a few words cannot suffice—how much less for those below?\n\nToday, people mistake *oral instructions* for shortcuts; this is wrong. When oral instructions are incomplete, the teacher departs and returns. During discussion, one listens closely and commits to memory, so as to connect with ancient texts and illuminate the stages. This is the wonder of oral instructions. When one has read many alchemical classics, a single hearing of oral instructions can bring sudden awakening. The classics verify the instructions, and the instructions verify the classics—true and unfailing, in accord with the great Dao. This is why a true teacher must be sought, and why mere cleverness cannot be relied upon.\n\nMoreover, the root of a true teacher lies in one who has cultivated virtue and refined it into attainment. How could they not know the profound and secret words that heaven bestows upon the good and withholds from the unworthy? If one knows yet speaks lightly of them, why did Master Ziyang receive three divine reprimands? Their silence is not unwillingness to speak, but a reluctance to speak lightly.\n\nEven when great vessels meet and the transmission is urgent, the teacher must repeatedly test and refine the disciple. Only after the disciple’s diligence and the teacher’s toil do they swear an oath, light incense, and pass on the bowl of transmission. From this day forward, the lineage extends into the future—take care not to hear and fail to practice, nor to receive and hoard in secret. Given all this, is speaking not difficult?\n\nIn my commentary on the *Daodejing*, though more detailed than those of earlier scholars, each chapter’s annotations follow the text and leave its words intact, unable to fully articulate the wondrous mechanisms of the alchemical Dao in complete passages. Heroes and aspirants, if you can find a wise teacher to point them out, attaining the method will be all the easier.\n\n*Blocking the apertures and shutting the gates* nurtures spirit and qi.\n*Blunting sharpness* without being blunted by sharpness—this is the ability to guard weakness.\n*Untangling knots* without being entangled by them—this is the ability to remain serene.\n*Softening the light* to conceal its brilliance,\n*merging with the dust* to transcend it—\nMencius said: *The sage’s relation to the people is also like this.*\nThis is the essence of *mysterious sameness*.\n\nThus, it cannot be approached with intimacy, nor distanced with estrangement. If it could be approached with intimacy, it could also be distanced with estrangement. The same applies to profit and harm, nobility and lowliness. Therefore, it is the most precious under heaven—nothing surpasses the sage’s virtue.\n\n**Chapter Fifty-Seven**\n(In the Heshang Gong commentary, titled *The Chapter of Pure Wind*; in Peng’s version, *The Chapter of Governing with Rectitude*)\n\nGovern the state with rectitude,\ndeploy troops with奇,\nwin the world through non-interference.\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this.",

The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness. Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin; governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing. To understand these two paths is to grasp the model. One who comprehends this model is said to possess mysterious virtue. Mysterious virtue runs deep and far, reversing the course of things, and thus attaining great harmony.\n\nThe Dao does not value knowledge or discernment, for these diminish its undifferentiated wholeness; it values instead the state of not-knowing and not-discerning, thereby preserving its namelessness. Thus, those adept in the Dao do not seek to enlighten the people but to render them simple.\n\n“The people are difficult to govern because of their excessive cleverness” echoes the earlier saying: “When cunning and wisdom arise, great falsity follows.” “Governing the state through cleverness is the state’s ruin” corresponds to: “The more meticulous the governance, the more deficient the people.” “Governing the state without cleverness is the state’s blessing” aligns with: “Abandon sagacity, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.”\n\nThese two paths—cleverness and non-cleverness—truly determine the state’s fortune or misfortune and serve as the model for governance.

Therefore, when the sage wishes to rise above the people, they must speak as though beneath them. When they wish to lead the people, they must place themselves behind. Thus, though the sage stands above, the people do not feel burdened; though they stand ahead, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore, the world delights in exalting them without weariness. Because they do not contend, none in the world can contend with them.\n\nRivers and seas excel in staying low, so all streams flow toward them—hence they are called kings of the hundred valleys.

To rise above the people while speaking humbly is what was previously called “the high takes the low as its foundation.” To lead the people while placing oneself behind is what was previously called “putting oneself last, yet finding oneself first.” Thus, the sage’s virtue is empty and harmonious: standing above, they possess no awe-inspiring majesty, yet the people do not feign reverence; standing ahead, they carry no overbearing force, yet the people feel no need to guard against harm.

      "translated_text": "The people’s hunger arises from their superiors consuming excessive taxes—this is why they hunger. The people’s unruliness arises from their superiors’ meddling—this is why they are unruly. The people’s disregard for death arises from their excessive pursuit of life’s comforts—this is why they disregard death. Only those who do not treat life as something to be clung to are wiser than those who prize life.\n\nWhen superiors consume excessive taxes, the people’s famine arises. When superiors meddle excessively, the people’s unruliness becomes evident. The people’s disregard for death stems from their greed for wealth and profit, their desire to enrich their lives—thus they treat their bodies lightly, heedless of danger. As the saying goes, “Men die for wealth”—this is the case. Only those who do not value wealth and profit highly maintain a clear mind and few desires, and they are wiser than those who prize life.\n\n*My humble note: Excessive taxes starve the people, just as overtaxing the body with labor leads to withering. Excessive meddling makes governance difficult, just as overusing the spirit leads to chaos.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Six**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Against Strength”; Peng’s version titles it “On Abiding Above”)*\n\nWhen people are alive, they are supple and soft; when dead, they are rigid and hard. When the myriad things—plants and trees—are alive, they are tender and fragile; when dead, they are withered and dry. Thus, the rigid and hard are companions of death; the supple and soft are companions of life. Therefore, when an army is strong, it will not prevail; when a tree is hard, it will be felled. The strong and great dwell below; the soft and weak dwell above.\n\nThe supple and weak pertain to *qi*; the rigid and hard pertain to bone. When *qi* gathers and the body harmonizes, there is life; when *qi* scatters and bones stand alone, there is death. The life and death of the myriad things follow this pattern. When tender and fragile, water-*qi* is abundant—thus life. When withered and dry, water-*qi* is exhausted—thus death. Rigidity and hardness are tied to death; suppleness and softness are tied to life. Should one rely solely on the easily visible forms and appearances to understand this?\n\nConsider further the analogy: When an army is strong but does not prevail, its *qi* has already declined while the enemy’s *qi* is still flourishing. When a tree is hard, its joints knot—its hard *qi* cannot flow, and its growth halts at the size of a hand’s span. Thus, the distinction between above and below is also determined by rigidity and softness. In cultivating the self, can one not regard humility and harmony as paramount?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “The Dao of Heaven”; Peng’s version concurs)*\n\nIs not the Dao of Heaven like the drawing of a bow? What is high is pressed down; what is low is lifted up. What has excess is reduced; what is deficient is supplemented. The Dao of Heaven reduces excess to supplement deficiency. The Dao of man is not so—it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world? Only those who possess the Dao.\n\nThus, the sage acts without relying on his actions, accomplishes without dwelling on his achievements—does he not wish to display his worth? The highest teaching speaks in plain terms: The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow, its essence lying in balance and uprightness. Press down the high, lift up the low—then both arms are level. Reduce excess, supplement deficiency—then the body is aligned. The Dao of Heaven’s marvel in harmonizing the seven celestial bodies and ordering the five phases lies precisely in its balance and uprightness. Hence it is said: “The Dao of Heaven reduces excess and supplements deficiency.”\n\nThe Dao of man is otherwise: it reduces the deficient to serve the excessive, causing the deficient to become even more deficient and the excessive even more excessive. Who can take their excess to serve the world’s deficiencies? Only those who embody Heaven’s Dao and desire that all things attain their proper place—such is the sage. He acts without reliance, accomplishes without dwelling, reduces his excess to serve the world without claiming virtue—does he not avoid displaying his worth?\n\n*Vulgar annotation in verse:*\nHeaven’s Dao diminishes the full and humility receives benefit;\nHuman nature consumes the meager, and loss brings greater misfortune.\nIf one can grasp the meaning of this classic,\nThe elixir of gold and cinnabar aligns with the sagely lineage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Eight**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Trust and Responsibility”; Peng’s version titles it “Softness and Weakness”)*\n\nNothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing can surpass it—nothing can replace it. That the weak overcomes the strong, the soft overcomes the rigid, is known to all under Heaven, yet none can practice it. Therefore, the sage says: “One who bears the state’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain. One who bears the state’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven.” Straightforward words seem paradoxical.\n\nThese three lines echo the earlier saying: “The softest under Heaven rides roughshod over the hardest under Heaven.” Nothing can replace it—no other thing can substitute for this power to attack the hard. That softness and weakness overcome rigidity and strength is a principle all know, yet none ultimately practice. Thus, the Supreme again cites the sage’s words to illustrate the great virtue of softness and weakness.\n\nBearing the state’s disgrace, bearing the state’s misfortune—these are the sage’s self-assumed burdens, as in: “I alone am at fault; what guilt have the people? My virtue is meager and thin; Heaven inflicts this calamity.” That “straightforward words seem paradoxical” means that the sage’s true words all turn inward, never blaming others. This, too, is the Dao of softness and weakness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Seventy-Nine**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Fulfilling Agreements”; Peng’s version concurs)*",

      "translated_text": "Reconciling great resentment inevitably leaves residual bitterness—how can this be called true goodness? Thus, the sage holds the left tally and makes no demands upon others. Those with virtue oversee the contract; those without virtue enforce scrutiny. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good.\n\nWhen the myriad regions brim with resentment, the ruler’s virtue must be meager. To encounter the people’s grievances and still refuse self-reproach, instead seeking to reconcile great resentment—even if reconciliation succeeds, unresolved bitterness remains within, and residual grievance cannot be dispelled. How can this be deemed perfect goodness? Confucius said: “Be severe with oneself and lenient toward others, and resentment will stay far away.” Thus, the sage governs the world by cultivating the virtue of self-rigor, earning the people’s trust. Without demanding of others, the people naturally place their faith in him. It is like a contract split into left and right halves, each party holding one as perpetual proof—then you harbor no deceit toward me, and I harbor no suspicion toward you. The sage holds virtue as one holds the left tally; how could the people not rejoice? Therefore, those with virtue oversee the contract, while those without virtue enforce scrutiny. *Scrutiny* means examining faults. To be meticulous in fault-finding while never reflecting on oneself is to act in a way the people will not follow.\n\nThe Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever aligns with the good. As the *Book of Documents* says: “August Heaven has no favorites; it befriends those who revere it. The people have no constant allegiance; they cleave to those who are humane.”\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Standing Alone”; Peng’s version titles it “Small States”)*\n\nLet the state be small, its people few. Though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men, let them not use them. Let the people regard death as weighty and not wander far. Though there be boats and carriages, let there be no occasion to ride them. Though there be armor and weapons, let there be no occasion to deploy them. Let the people return to knotting cords for use.\n\nLet them find sweetness in their food, beauty in their clothing, contentment in their dwellings, and joy in their customs. Neighboring states may gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another.\n\nIf there be those who wish to enlarge the state and multiply its people, let them possess tools for a hundred million yet not use them—surely their sufficiency will be all the greater. This is to emulate the return to antiquity and the restoration of primal simplicity.\n\nThe Supreme One does not act thus. He takes the small to exemplify the great, so that from the small, the great may be known. When a state is small and its people few, though they possess tools for ten or a hundred men and do not use them, their sufficiency will only increase. What difficulty is there in returning to unadorned simplicity? Thus, he lets the people not use their tools, treasuring only their own lives. Let them dwell in their native land and not migrate elsewhere. Let them hold death in awe and not die, nurture life and live long—what more could they seek beyond this?\n\nIn such a time, the people of the state walk with light and vigorous steps, so though they have boats and carriages, they do not ride them. Within the state’s borders, there are no thieves or bandits, so though they have armor and weapons, they do not deploy them. The governance of the state is simple and unadorned, so the practice of knotting cords may continue. Sweet food, fine clothing, secure dwellings, and joyful customs—neighboring states gaze upon one another, the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way, yet the people grow old and die without ever visiting one another. Thus, social obligations are few, and extravagance does not arise; material goods are abundant, and each family dwells in peace.\n\nThe lofty ones of the state say: “A single hill, a single ravine—we deem ourselves beyond the mortal world. A spring, an autumn—we seem to forget time within a gourd. Grandparents and parents live long in health; husbands and wives remain together for life. Brothers and sisters play the *xun* and *chi* in harmony; children and grandchildren train phoenixes and cranes. How is this different from the grotto heavens and blessed lands, the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss?”\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Eighty-One**\n*(Heshang Gong’s commentary titles this “Revealing Simplicity”; Peng’s version titles it “Non-Accumulation”)*\n\nTruthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful. The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good. The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.\n\nThe sage does not accumulate. The more he does for others, the more he possesses; the more he gives to others, the more he has. The Way of Heaven benefits and does not harm. The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.\n\nTruth, goodness, and wisdom all pertain to establishing words. This passage concludes the entire scripture’s meaning. Sincere discourse is simply genuine, not embellished to please the world. Those who seek to please the world employ embellishment, not sincerity—hence: “Truthful words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not truthful.” The excellence of inherited teachings is simply correctness, not contrived to confuse others. Those who seek to confuse others employ contrivance, not proper transmission—hence: “The good do not dispute; the disputatious are not good.” Penetrating writings are simply coherent, not overflowing to display talent. Those who seek to display talent overflow without restraint, not truly penetrating—hence: “The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.”\n\nThis is followed by establishing virtue and merit to fulfill the great function of this scripture. *Accumulation* means accumulating goodness. The sage does not speak of accumulating goodness but establishes his own great merit and virtue. Thus, his merit is boundless, his virtue all-encompassing. By acting for others through merit and virtue, he gains ever more; by bestowing merit and virtue upon others, he possesses ever more.\n\nThe Dao operates silently to generate and complete, thus it benefits without harming. The Way of the sage works with effortless spontaneity, not contending with others in accumulating good deeds—thus its greatness equals that of Heaven. As the ancient saying goes: “The highest establish virtue, the next establish merit, the next establish words—all three are imperishable.” This may serve as a colophon for this text.\n\nAfter completing his commentary on this scripture, Master Hanxu reflected and pondered, aligning words with deeds, and declared that though he did not rely on written words, he had expressed the true mechanism. The final chapter’s commentary concludes with merit and virtue, which he deemed fine and good. Yet upon further reflection, he wondered how the four characters “acts and does not contend” could serve as the root of the eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: “Yes, yes—this single phrase is the very keystone of the entire scripture!”",

      "translated_text": "When his wife returned from gathering firewood, she asked, “Did you give him your consent?” He replied, “I did.” His wife said, “I have heard that ‘those who may be fed with wine and meat may be followed with whips and cudgels; those who may be granted office and emolument may be followed with axes and halberds.’ I cannot bear to be controlled by others.” She cast aside her basket and left. Overjoyed, Lao Laizi immediately fled with his wife.\n\nSima Qian records: “Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was enfeoffed at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang; Wang’s son was Yan; Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son, Jie, became Grand Tutor to the Prince of Jiaoxi and settled his family in Qi.” At that time, their ancestors and descendants, fathers and sons, must have wandered without fixed abode, branching into separate lineages.\n\nSome say: in Yue he was Fan Li; in Qi, the leather sack (Chiyi); in Wu, Tao Zhugong; in the early Han, the Yellow Stone Master; and in the reign of Emperor Wen, the Master by the River. All these remain unfathomable.\n\nGe Zhichuan states: Laozi appeared in every age, repeatedly changing his name. The reason, according to the *Nine Palaces*, *Three and Five Classics*, and *Yuanchen Jing*, is that each person encounters calamitous conjunctions in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the transformations of primordial qi, thereby transcending misfortune and prolonging life. Many Daoist practitioners today follow this practice. Laozi remained in Zhou for several hundred years, during which he must have faced more than one such conjunction, hence his many names. To properly establish the truth of Laozi’s life, one should rely primarily on historical records and verified accounts, cross-referencing them with Laozi’s esoteric scriptures. Other popular tales are largely fictitious.\n\nFurthermore, the *Western Ascension’s Central Embryo*, *Returning Mandate’s Essence*, *Pearl Strategem and Jade Mechanism*, and *Golden Internal Classic* all describe Laozi as having a pale yellow complexion, fine brows and a broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, spaced teeth and a square mouth, thick lips, a forehead marked with three or five lines of insight, sun-like temples and moon-like brows, a nose with pure bone and twin pillars, ears with three passages, feet bearing the pattern of two and five, hands grasping the ten celestial stems, a height of nine feet, and sixty-eight teeth—such was the countenance of a sage. Those who receive the Mandate of Heaven possess divine foresight and differ from ordinary people, destined to become masters of the Dao. Thus, they are aided by celestial spirits and followed by immortals. For this reason, the methods he transmitted for transcending the world numbered nine hundred and thirty scrolls, and his talismanic writings seventy scrolls—all recorded in the central chapters of *Laozi’s Original Account*. The catalogues still exist and can be verified. Works not included in these numbers were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not authentic texts (as noted by Zhichuan).\n\nLaozi embodied non-action and self-transformation, purity and self-rectification (*Records of the Grand Historian*). He devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of longevity, and though he remained in Zhou for a long time, his rank and position never advanced. This was because he sought to harmonize with the world while inwardly preserving his natural essence. Only after attaining the Dao did he depart—truly an immortal (*Biographies of Divine Transcendents*).\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Zhou to inquire about ritual from Laozi, Laozi said, “The man of whom you speak—his flesh and bones have long since decayed; only his words remain. Moreover, when the noble person finds the right moment, he mounts his chariot; when he does not, he drifts like tumbleweed. I have heard that ‘the good merchant conceals his wealth as if empty, and the noble person of great virtue appears foolish.’ Rid yourself of your arrogance and excessive desires, your affected demeanor and reckless ambitions—none of these benefit you.”\n\nOne day, Laozi asked Confucius, “Have you attained the Dao?”",

His wife was profoundly wise, and together with Lao Laizi, they withdrew to live among the mulberry fields and plows.\n\nHe composed a work in fifteen chapters expounding the application of the Daoist arts. When King Zhuang of Chu heard of him, he sought to compare himself to Laozi. At the time, Lao Laizi was weaving, and the king approached to ask, “I wish to govern the state—may you assist me in this?” Laozi replied, “Very well.” The king then departed.",

Mosquitoes and gadflies biting the skin keep one awake all night. Now, benevolence and righteousness assail my heart and mind with such vehemence—no greater disorder exists! You, sir, should let the world not lose its uncarved simplicity, move with the wind, stand by embracing virtue, and return together to the natural—what need is there to act so strenuously, as if carrying a great drum in search of a lost child? The swan does not bathe daily to remain white, nor does the crow blacken itself daily to stay black. The natural black and white are not sufficient to distinguish beauty from ugliness.

      "translated_text": "Debating the Way of the former kings and elucidating the traces of Zhou and Shao—yet not a single ruler could put them to use. How difficult it is to persuade others, and how hard to clarify the Dao! ”\n\nLaozi said, “The *Six Classics* are but the worn traces of the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of now are still only traces. Footprints are what shoes produce, yet are footprints the shoes themselves? ”\n\nConfucius returned home and for three days did not speak. Zilu, finding this strange, asked him about it. Confucius said, “Of birds, I know they can fly. Of fish, I know they can swim. Of beasts, I know they can run. Those that run may be caught in nets, those that swim with lines, those that fly with arrows. But as for the dragon, I know not how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend the nine heavens. Today, having seen Laozi, is he not like the dragon? ”\n\nLaozi dwelt in Zhou for many years. Seeing the virtue of Zhou in decline, he then rode a black ox cart westward through the Qin Pass to ascend Kunlun. The Pass Prefect Yin Xi, having observed the purple qi, knew in advance of his coming and swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. Soon after, Laozi indeed arrived. Yin Xi said, “Master, you are about to withdraw from the world—pray compose a book for me.” Thereupon, Laozi halted his carriage at the pass and wrote the *Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand characters, imparting it fully to Yin Xi before departing.\n\nDuring the Eastern Han, in Qingzhou there was a man of the Wang clan named Cheng, styled Xuanfu, with the Daoist name Donghua. He encountered the Queen Mother of the West, Wang Qizhu. Pleased by their shared surname, she bestowed upon him the title *Supreme Perfected of White Clouds* and transmitted to him Laozi’s *Azure Talismans and Jade Scriptures*, along with the *Golden Regulations and Numinous Writings*. Xuanfu practiced diligently for three years without slackening. Moved by his devotion, Laozi descended and condensed the *Inner Radiance of the Yellow Court* into a single scroll, naming it the *Outer Radiance*, which he imparted to Xuanfu for cultivation, along with the nine revolutions and eight jade elixir’s firing times. Xuanfu then concealed his brilliance, built a hermitage, and refined himself in seclusion. Upon achieving perfection, he was titled the *Lord Emperor Donghua*, governing the lesser yang qi of the East. He was also called the *Lesser Yang of the Purple Palace* and the *Great Emperor of Fusang*, serving as a minister and assistant. After three transmissions, it reached the Pure Yang Master, who said: “Laozi’s *Outer Radiance* and the Jade Emperor’s *Inner Radiance* are both preserved in the Fusang Palace. The Donghua Patriarch extolled and transmitted them, thereby revealing Laozi’s intent to deliver the world.”\n\nNow, Laozi’s former incarnation was as the Most High Lord Lao, and thus his concealments and transformations were as one with the Lord Lao. In high antiquity, the Lord Lao first manifested as the Three Purities. During the era of the Heavenly Sovereign, he changed his name to the *Celestial Master of Myriad Laws*; during the Earthly Sovereign’s time, to the *Mysterious Center Master*; during the Human Sovereign’s time, to *Master Unyielding*. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the *Golden Gate Lord Emperor*. In the time of Fuxi, he was *Yu Hua* (later changed to *Yu Mi*); during Shennong’s reign, *Old Master of Nine Spirits*; under Emperor Ku, *Lu Tu*; in the time of Yao, *Master of Accomplishment*; under Shun, *Master Yin Shou*; during the Xia of Yu, *Master True Conduct*; and in the Shang of Tang, *Master Bestowed Principle*. By the reign of King Wuding of Shang, he first descended in full spirit as Laozi—this was a time of opening a new phase and re-creating heaven and earth.\n\nLater generations, not understanding, conflated the Lord Lao with Laozi, thus merging the deeds of his former incarnation with his later one. Some claim Laozi existed before heaven and earth, others that he was the essence and spirit of heaven. Those who seek the truth sigh at such vagueness, for these accounts do not appear in the *Authentic Scripture of the Old Immortal*. *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* states: “Where there is heavenly virtue, there is the arts of the Dao. The adepts of the Dao—when have they ever been absent? From the times of Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor down to the Three Dynasties, those who manifested the arts of the Dao have appeared in every age. Why must it always be the same Laozi?” This is all due to later students who, fond of the marvelous and valuing the extraordinary, sought to exalt Laozi and thus fabricated such tales. In truth, Laozi was merely one who attained the Dao with exceptional precision—nothing divine or strange.\n\nWhy? If Laozi is said to have attained the Dao, then others may strive to emulate him. But if he is deemed divine and strange, then immortality becomes unattainable. In my humble view, the Lord Lao in earlier times was divine and strange, while Laozi in later times was like other men. What is divine and strange cannot be learned, but what is like other men can be. My intent, Zhichuan, is only to follow the factual evidence.\n\nThe Confucians say that the birth of sages arises from human qi and endows heavenly essence—this is most fitting. Laozi’s bodily existence borrowed the four great elements to form his shape. Through refined cultivation and grand endeavor, he became the model for divine immortals, the patriarch of virtue and the Dao’s tradition. When his merit was complete and his conduct fulfilled, he returned to the assembly of all heavens. Dispersed, he becomes myriad; united, he is one. His divided spirits descend into the world, all taking cultivation of the Dao as their foundation. What cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.\n\nAs for Zhuangzi, Dongfang Shuo, and the like, who are said to be Laozi under different names—these claims are unreliable, for they were merely those to whom Laozi granted gifts. The *Treasure Eulogy* says: “Those who produced Zhuangzi of the Mulberry Grove and Dongfang Shuo discerned subtle traces like cinnabar.” This is akin to the mother of Danyang, who dreamed of receiving a divine cinnabar script and gave birth to a great immortal. The *Immortals’ Biographies* state: “Those who follow Laozi’s teachings are all pure, empty, tranquil, and uncontentious, thus able to conceal jade within coarse robes and remain unshaken in perilous times.” Its source is deep and its flow vast—could this not be the teacher and model for all ages, as ordained by heaven and earth?\n\nHaving dwelt in Qingdao for several years, I once instructed the latecomers Zhu, Jiecheng Li, and Huifeng Liu in Laozi’s method of purity and stillness. I was ever cautious and reverent, never daring to forget the ancestral teachings.\n\nBefore was the Lord Lao, after was Laozi—are they one or two? Their harmony and distinction are perfectly clear.",

      "translated_text": "The terms \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower\" do not refer to the names of three chapters but rather to three levels of meaning. These three are interwoven and blended within the text, recurring and unfolding subtly throughout its passages—precisely what is meant by \"interweaving the three and merging them as one.\"\n\nDaoist adepts regard \"strengthening the army and securing victory\" as matters pertaining to the refinement of the elixir and the upward ascent of the Dao. Why, then, is it labeled as the \"lower\" level? Laozi said: *\"Fine weapons are an inauspicious qi; they are used only when there is no other choice.\"* In my earlier commentary on the *Daode Jing*, I mistakenly received the approval of a sagely teacher. Recently, upon continuing with the *Yin Fu Jing*, I admired its brevity of text, its profound intent, and how each character cuts to the essence of secret alchemical language. Thus, I once more settled my mind to observe things clearly and composed this commentary to elucidate its meaning.\n\n*Preface by Juanshi Shanren Huoxi Yue on the Great River*\n\nPeople know the divine as divine but do not understand why the non-divine is divine. I observe Hanxu—his appearance is that of a fool, and others take him for one. Yet I do not. When Hanxu annotated the *Daode Jing*, the *Qingjing Jing*, the *Dingguan Jing*, and the *Wuchu Jing*, people marveled at him, but I did not. Recently, upon contemplating the heavens and discerning the \"Five Thieves,\" examining the earth and discussing the pacification of the people—principles for a peaceful populace and a prosperous state, techniques for strengthening the army and securing victory—all were expounded in his commentary on the *Yin Fu Jing*. From this, even I cannot fathom the depths of Hanxu’s wisdom.\n\nThe *Preface* asserts that *\"since the beginning of creation, there must have been writing\"* and vigorously defends its antiquity, demonstrating both talent and insight. The *Yin Fu Jing* emerged in the time of the Yellow Emperor, after the slaughter of Chiyou. The Yellow Emperor sought out Guangchengzi, who transmitted this text to him. Silently observing the ministers at court—such as Feng Hou, Li Mu, Qi Bo, Tongjun, Dou Bao, and Da Nao—all of whom understood the mechanisms of killing, the cycles of life and death, and the workings of the *jiazi* calendar, Guangchengzi surveyed them and spoke in cryptic, perilous language, concealing within it a path of perfect clarity. His intent was for all in the Yellow Emperor’s retinue to hear this wondrous teaching. To enlighten the Yellow Emperor was to enlighten his ministers—how vast was Guangchengzi’s true capacity!\n\nConfucians of the Three Dynasties and later have doubted whether this is a text from before the Three Dynasties, but their skepticism merely skims the surface of its words. Suppose there were an elixir of immortality brought to market for sale. If one falsely claimed it was rat poison, or even said it could cure illness, people would surely dismiss and ridicule it, perhaps even revile it, for how could a poison also heal? Yet those with discernment would purchase and consume it, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight. This is precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*—precisely the meaning of the *Yin Fu Jing*.\n\n*Composed with reverence by Zhang Quanyi, Daoist friend of the Purple Radiance Grotto on Penglai Mountain*\n\n*Collected Evaluations from Various Masters*\n\n**Daguanzhi** said: *\"Internally, it reveals the mechanisms of heaven; externally, it aligns with human affairs. In its subtlety, even the Eight Scenes of the* Huangting *are insufficient to match its profundity. In its essential teachings, the hundred schools of philosophy and history cannot compare. In its strategic ingenuity, even the works of Sunzi, Wuzi, and Han Fei pale in wonder. Thus, the nature of all things, the calculations of success and failure, the principles of life and death—all are but mechanisms.\"*\n\n**Zhang Guo** said: *\"To observe the Dao of nature is to observe nothing. Not observing with the eyes but with the mind. Observing the profoundly subtle yet seeing nothing—thus one illuminates the nature of the natural. This is what is meant by* yin. *To grasp the conduct of nature is to grasp nothing. Not grasping with the hands but with the mechanism. The mechanism is adaptable and unbound—thus one harmonizes with the manifestations of the natural. This is what is meant by* fu *(another interpretation).\"*",

      "translated_text": "The inclusion of Zhang Guo’s sayings reveals that this text postdates him.\n\nOuyang Xunqi said: *\"When the Dao and its arts fragmented, those who could write each composed their own books. Straightforward words often appear flawed or impure, yet the* Yin Fu Jing *alone employs paradox to align with truth.\"*\n\nWei Heshān said: *\"Li Jiayou was broadly versed in the classics and the hundred schools, and deeply steeped in the* Book of Changes*. In his later years, he grasped the teaching of ‘specializing in qi to attain suppleness,’ and through exhaustive study and reflection on the* Yin Fu Jing *and* Cantong Qi*, he held fast to them without wavering. Thus, those who comprehend the Dao necessarily unite these two texts with the* Book of Changes*, employing them as one.\"*\n\nLu Qianxu said: *\"The* Yin Fu Jing *and* Daode Jing *both speak of the mechanisms of inversion and counter-application. As for governing the state, waging war, seizing the realm, or the phrases ‘there are wondrous devices,’ ‘the ten thousand images arise,’ ‘the eight trigrams and the sexagenary cycle,’ and ‘divine mechanisms and hidden spirits’—all contain profound principles. Yet the world, not understanding, labels the* Yin Fu Jing *as a treatise on military strategy and uses the* Laozi *for governance, missing the mark entirely.\"*\n\nThe *Yin Fu Jing* is a manual of cultivation. *Yin fu* is spoken of in contrast to *yang fire*; it speaks of yin without mentioning yang, for yang is contained within it. The *Yi Yi* states: *\"The Dao is called the alternation of yin and yang.\"* That yin is placed before yang reflects the principle of heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things: without stillness, there is no movement, just as *Bo* precedes *Fu*. This single scroll of the *Yin Fu Jing* is the pivot of yin-yang interpenetration. The numinous perishes here, and the non-numinous numinous arises here. This is where concealment and manifestation, reversal and return, ingress and egress, the waxing and waning of sun and moon, the ebb and flow of great and small, the root of life and death’s restraint, the ground where kindness and harm contend, and the realm of water and fire’s advance and retreat all unfold. When yin and yang restrain each other, yin and yang prevail. The *Yin Fu* commands the numinous transformations of change. Yet those who wield the *Yin Fu* must know that the body possesses wondrous devices. Concealing these devices within, awaiting the moment to act, the trigrams, the sexagenary cycle, heaven, earth, ghosts, and spirits will all accord with the Dao—what difficulty then remains in enriching the state, pacifying the people, strengthening the army, securing victory, and embracing unity to preserve the true?\"\n\nZheng’s *Bibliographic Survey* records thirty-eight transmitted commentaries on the *Yin Fu Jing*, totaling fifty-one scrolls. Over the centuries since, the number of annotations has grown beyond measure. I have now synthesized explanations from the *Laozi*, the *Book of Changes*, and the *Cantong Qi*, entitling it *A Categorized Exegesis*. *\"Observe the Dao of heaven, grasp the movement of heaven—this is all.\"*\n\n*\"Observe the Dao of heaven\"*—the text opens by speaking of the *Yin Fu*. Laozi said: *\"Achieving merit, attaining fame, then withdrawing—this is the Dao of heaven.\"* *\"Grasp the movement of heaven\"*—the next phrase supplements *yang fire*. The *Xici* states: *\"Heaven’s movement is ceaseless; the noble person strengthens themselves without pause.\"* To observe the Dao of heaven is to witness its flourishing and fulfillment, its retreat and storage at winter’s advent—the meaning of *Kun*’s six lines reaching exhaustion lies herein. To grasp the movement of heaven is to seize its latent emergence, its vigilant leaping, until the ninth-five, when the flying dragon ascends to heaven—the meaning of *Kun* following heaven’s movement rides in its wake. The opening two sentences subtly encompass the two hexagrams *Qian* and *Kun*, for the *Yin Fu* is the Dao of the *Book of Changes*. *\"This is all\"*—an exclamation of ultimate insight.\n\n*\"Heaven has five thieves; those who perceive them prosper. The five thieves reside in the heart, enacted upon heaven. The cosmos lies within the hand, the ten thousand transformations arise within the body.\"*\n\n*Thieves* here align with the meanings of *restraint* and *plunder* below. The *five thieves* are the five phases. Heaven possesses the five phases, where mutual restraint harbors the subtlety of mutual generation, and mutual plunder conceals the mechanism of mutual appropriateness. One who penetrates this principle will see the flourishing of the Dao and qi. The five phases reside within the human heart; only by inverting and counter-applying them can mutual restraint and generation, mutual plunder and appropriateness be achieved. Observing this profound principle, one sees that it is already so in heaven. Those who embody heaven’s enactment will hold the cosmos in their hand and give birth to the ten thousand transformations within their body. *\"Thus it is.\"*\n\nHaving spoken of *\"giving birth to the body,\"* the five thieves are no longer thieves. Heaven’s nature is humanity; the human heart is the trigger. *\"Establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life.\"* *Nature* is principle. The *five thieves* are heaven’s principle, which is also humanity’s principle. Within the person, they are activated by the heart, enabling restraint to harbor generation and plunder to conceal appropriateness—all through the single word *trigger*. The *Yi Yi* states: *\"Establish the Dao of heaven as yin and yang.\"* Speaking of heaven includes earth; speaking of earth includes humanity. Thus, *\"establish the Dao of heaven to stabilize human life.\"* Yin and yang encompass the five phases—how could humanity exist outside yin and yang?\n\n*\"When heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, the stars and planets conceal (or fall) themselves.

Life and death are the triggers of movement and stillness.

The phrases of the *Yin Fu* often each express half, prompting the reader to infer the rest. *\"When humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn\"*—humanity and heaven-earth form a triad, their killing mechanisms naturally analogous to the *Book of Changes*’ *\"reversing its path, returning in seven days.\"* *Reversal* is the handle of life and death’s alternation, the power of waxing and waning’s control. *\"When heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the ten thousand transformations establish their foundation.\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"This mechanism is the same, this principle is the same. Long ago, Patriarch Lü transformed himself into a servant in the Chen household. Chen and a Daoist were discussing how *'when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, heaven and earth overturn,'* yet they did not grasp the essence of the killing mechanism. Patriarch Lü interjected from the side, saying: *'The living do not truly live; the dead do not truly die. If one kills life after it has arisen and learns death before it arrives, then one attains longevity.'*\n\nNow, considering Patriarch Lü’s words, we understand that the killing mechanism is the pivotal point of life and death. Alas, Chen was misled by the Daoist—startled at first, then swiftly bewildered.\n\nNature possesses both decay and clumsiness, which can be concealed. The nine orifices’ deviations lie in the three essentials, where movement and stillness operate. Fire arises from wood, yet disaster inevitably consumes it. Treachery arises in the state, and when the moment moves, it must collapse.\n\nTo know this and cultivate refinement is to be called a sage.\n\nThere is the nature of *qi*-constitution and the original nature. The nature of *qi*-constitution appears skillful but is truly clumsy. The original nature appears clumsy but is truly skillful. These two can be concealed. When concealed, they remain profoundly still; when stimulated, they penetrate all. The skillful conceals clumsiness, and clumsiness conceals skill.\n\nThe reason people cannot conceal themselves lies in the deviations of the nine orifices. Among these, the ears, eyes, and mouth are the three essentials. These three can move and can be still. In stillness, one contains the light of the eyes, condenses the resonance of the ears, and seals the *qi* of the tongue—thus the three essentials reverse into three treasures. In movement, form blinds, sound deafens, and flavor dulls—thus the three essentials become three calamities.\n\nDo you not see fire? It arises from wood yet consumes wood, just as sight arises from the eyes yet harms them, hearing arises from the ears yet injures them, and flavor arises from the mouth yet dulls it. Likewise, treachery arises in the state: in stillness, deviance lies hidden; in movement, it collapses.\n\nIf one knows the mechanism of movement and stillness, masters stillness, and cultivates refinement, then one may be called a sage.\n\nHeaven gives life, heaven takes life—such is the principle of the Dao. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things.

      "translated_text": "Life and death are the wondrous principles of Heaven, which are the wondrous principles of the supreme Dao. That which kills first steals and conceals the qi of life. Heaven and earth are the thieves of the ten thousand things. Thus, at winter solstice when spring returns, the qi of life first conceals itself in the place of returning to the root. The ten thousand things are the thieves of humanity, so when sprouts emerge and husks split, the qi of life first conceals itself within the union of essence. Humanity is the thief of the ten thousand things, so when taking much and using broadly, the qi of life first conceals itself within preservation and nurturance. Within killing there is life—this is to cultivate primordial qi while awaiting the proper time, which is called \"theft.\"\n\nIn every movement and stillness, the constant of the Two Modes is that they nurture and advance together, and the three thieves nourish one another. Once they nourish one another, Heaven, earth, and humanity mutually conceal their functions. The Three Powers are Heaven, earth, and humanity; though \"things\" are not mentioned, they are included. If one is not at peace, there must be something that does not accord. When the three thieves are fitting, the Three Powers are also at peace. When the Three Powers are at peace, they give birth to and nurture the ten thousand things, moving in accord with the seasons.\n\nThe phrase *\"Thus it is said\"* continues the above and cites an ancient saying: the time when the mechanism of life first stirs is the moment when the qi mechanism first moves. If one swallows it into one’s own domain at that very moment, then the hundred parts of the body are ordered. The mechanism is the mechanism of killing; after great stillness, the first stirring of life arises, and if one ingests it in accord with the time, then the ten thousand images are at great peace. Thus it is said: *\"Move in accord with the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace.\"*\n\nPeople know the numinousness of the numinous, but do not know why the non-numinous is numinous. The sun and moon have their cycles, their waxing and waning have their measures, and sagely achievement arises from this, while the workings of spirit emerge from this. In the practice of refinement, nothing is more wondrous than spirit. People know that what is spiritually active is numinous, but do not know why what does not employ spiritual activity is numinous. This spirit arises from the extreme of stillness; when the time comes, the spirit knows, and skillfully discerns the mechanism of movement.\n\nIn its movement, the mechanism is like the sun and moon having their cycles. The *Cantong qi* says:\n*\"On the third day, brightness emerges, as Zhen and Geng receive from the west.\nOn the eighth day, Dui receives Ding, and the waxing half is level as a string.\nOn the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete, and the fullness of Jia fills the east.\nOn the sixteenth, it turns to receive governance, as Xun and Xin appear at dawn.\nGen meets Bing in the south, and the waning half is on the twenty-third.\nOn the thirtieth, Kun and Yi are in the northeast, where its light is lost.\"*\nThese are the cycles of the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.\n\nThe six gates and great medicine are measured by the sage using the waxing and waning of the sun and moon. And the six stages of obtaining the elixir should also be aligned with the measures of yin and yang. The *Cantong qi* says: *\"Yin and yang intertwine, the small departs and the great arrives.\"* When the small departs, the preceding movement is brief—this is the second stage of seeking the medicine. When the great arrives, the subsequent movement is long—this is the fourth stage of compounding the elixir. The twelvefold firing times lie within the cycles of the sun and moon and the measures of their waxing and waning. The sage’s achievement arises from this, and the workings of spirit emerge from this.\n\nAs for the mechanism of theft, none in the world can see it, none can know it. The noble person who obtains it strengthens the self; the petty person who obtains it treats life lightly. The mechanism of theft is the mechanism of seizing and plundering. Not only are the mutual conquests of the Five Phases and the mutual encroachments of the Three Powers mechanisms of theft, but even embracing spirit and guarding qi, extracting from Kan to fill Li, are also mechanisms of theft. The perfected person silently moves the numinous mechanism, enters the watery palace, creates in the golden land, follows in the footsteps of the profoundly subtle, and cuts off seeing and hearing—within this, there is that which none can see, none can know. The numinousness of the numinous dies here, and the numinousness of the non-numinous arises here. Thus, the noble person who obtains this mechanism of theft can create destiny and strengthen the self, while the petty person who obtains it will surely harm the self and treat life lightly. This is what is meant by: *\"The upright person uses it for uprightness, the deviant person uses it for deviance.\"*\n\nThe blind are skilled in listening, the deaf are skilled in seeing. Cutting off profit from one source yields tenfold advantage from the teacher. Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher. The blind use their ears as eyes, listening to discern people’s smiles and expressions—thus it is said: *\"The blind are skilled in listening.\"* The deaf use their eyes as ears, using them to gauge people’s voices and emotions—thus it is said: *\"The deaf are skilled in seeing.\"* Yet within our own bodies, there are those without eyes who can listen with subtlety, and those without ears who can see with acuity. Skill in seeing and listening lies in distinguishing whether the source of water is clear or turbid.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Water is good at benefiting the ten thousand things.\"* From this, we know that cutting off excessive beauty reveals the true source of the One. *\"Yields tenfold advantage from the teacher\"* refers to the *Yijing*’s hexagram of Earth over Water as \"the teacher.\" Earth conquers water yet does not move it, so the water becomes even clearer. Using the teacher means employing earth to conquer water, advancing through danger yet proceeding smoothly. With this, one poisons the world, yet the people follow—what blame could there be? Ten is spoken of as the number of completion.\n\n*\"Three returns\"* refers to the number three belonging to wood. The fire essence and water mercury of the Li palace are born within wood, and the fire concealed within wood sinks together into the Kun palace. Kun truly completes Kan and gives birth to water, and the true qi within water becomes metal. After wood carries metal back, one must use *Zhun* and *Meng* to draw and add—thus it is said: *\"Three returns in day and night yield ten thousandfold advantage from the teacher.\"* Ten thousand is spoken of as the number of wholeness.\n\nThe fire tally of ten months can refine the treasure into the elixir. Seven returns and nine refinements are the three returns. The mind is born from things and dies from things. The mechanism lies in the eyes. Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it. Swift thunder and fierce winds—none do not stir foolishly. The mind moves because of things—this is being born from things. Pursuing things to the point of loss—this is dying from things.\n\nThe deviance of the nine orifices lies in the three essentials. Of the deviance of the three essentials, nothing is more essential than the eyes. To halt the mechanism, one must employ \"no kindness.\" Heaven is without kindness, yet great kindness arises from it—within death there is life, within movement there is stillness. Swift thunder and fierce winds all arise from the midst of foolish stirring, yet naturally possess numinous activity.",

How then, beneath the heavy yin, could it await the resurgence of earthly thunder and summon the renewing winds of *xun*?\n\nSupreme joy is abundant in nature; supreme stillness is restrained in nature. Heaven’s utmost partiality becomes the utmost impartiality in its use. Extending the principle of \"no kindness\" from above, \"no kindness\" is akin to \"non-action\"—the utmost of joy, the utmost of stillness. Supreme joy is leisurely and abundant in nature; supreme stillness is pure and incorrupt in nature. Thus, at times Heaven thunders without wind, appearing utterly partial. Yet from this seeming chaos, it issues commands—this is Heaven’s utmost impartiality. Utmost partiality resembles \"no kindness,\" while utmost impartiality gives rise to great kindness.\n\nThe regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Kindness arises from harm, and harm arises from kindness. Sinking water into fire invites self-destruction. (These two lines, in Wang Fengzhou’s edition, follow \"harm arises from kindness,\" forming a coherent meaning; here, the text follows his version.)\n\nThe *Baihu Tong* states: \"禽 (*qin*) means to be captured and controlled by man.\" The regulation of creatures lies in qi—qi is spoken of in terms of fire, and creatures in terms of the Vermilion Bird. To regulate creatures with qi is to regulate fire with fire. The *Cantong Qi* says: \"The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, holding balance and adjusting victory and defeat.\" This refers to the moment when earth suppresses water and prevents its rise; only the Vermilion Bird’s fire can maintain equilibrium, adjust the balance of power, and through intense refinement, cause water to boil and steam to rise, carrying metal upward with it. Thus, the regulation of the Vermilion Bird lies in sinking fire into water to lift water and restrain fire.\n\nWithin this lies the mechanism of life and death: when water boils and fire ascends into the *Li* palace, the *Li* fire is extinguished by the *Kan* water—this is \"life as the root of death.\" Subdued and constrained, unable to fly or flee, lead and mercury both perish, returning together to the fertile earth. Only through this great death does true life emerge—this is \"death as the root of life.\"\n\n\"Kindness arises from harm\": sinking fire into water. \"Harm arises from kindness\": drawing water into fire. The marvel of sinking water into fire lies in its self-generated life and death within the process, hence it is said: \"self-invited destruction.\" Fools revere the patterns of Heaven and Earth as sacred, while I regard the patterns of the seasons and things as wise.",

      "translated_text": "Fools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages. Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages. (These six lines are said by tradition to be the words of Wu Bo’s praise. The Fengzhou manuscript omits them, but I retain them here, placing them below “self-invited destruction.”)\n\nFools take mastery of celestial patterns and scrutiny of earthly principles as sagacity—yet if this is all, what benefit does it bring to body and mind? I examine the marvel of seasonal movement within celestial patterns and contemplate the mechanism of life’s emergence within earthly principles, stealing from Heaven and Earth to seize the workings of Creation—only then do I not shame the name of wisdom. This is what is meant by “observing the Dao of Heaven and grasping the movements of Heaven”—it is perfection itself.\n\n“Fools deem those who feign ignorance as sages; I deem those who do not feign ignorance as sages.” This is what is meant by “those who refine through knowledge are called sages.” “Fools regard those who await the appointed time as sages; I regard those who do not await the appointed time as sages.” This is what is meant by “people know the divine as divine, yet do not know the divinity of the non-divine.”\n\nMoreover, the sun and moon follow fixed paths, the great and small adhere to their measures, the Three Powers steal from one another—all are the sagely workings of nature. What is strange about this?\n\nThese six lines all seem to elaborate and praise the preceding passage.\n\nThe Dao of nature is quiescent, thus Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is gradual, thus yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in harmony. The Dao of nature is simply quiescence alone. From quiescence arises movement, and through movement, Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are born. The Dao of Heaven and Earth is simply gradualness alone. Gradualness is the image of nature. Yin gradually descends, yang gradually ascends. The marvel of yin and yang’s ascent and descent lies in their mutual overcoming. Without mutual overcoming, there is no mutual propulsion. Yin and yang propel one another, and transformations proceed in accordance with nature.\n\nTransformations are the image of advance and retreat. Master Zhu said: “These four lines on nature are exquisitely put.” He also said: “The character ‘gradual’ is wonderfully chosen.”\n\nThus, the sage knows the Dao of nature cannot be defied and thereby harnesses it. The Dao of utmost quiescence cannot be matched by calendrical calculations. Hence, there is the marvelous device from which arise the ten thousand images, the Eight Trigrams, and the celestial stems and earthly branches. Within it lie the divine mechanisms, the hidden workings of ghosts, and the arts of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming. How luminous—it transcends mere images!\n\nTo “thereby harness it” means to take the Dao of nature and fashion it into the methods of refinement. The Dao of nature truly emerges from utmost quiescence. Within this quiescence, there exists another realm of years and months, Heaven and Earth—unfathomable by human calendars and measurements.\n\nWhere does quiescence reside? There is a marvelous device: the Mysterious Pass, the single aperture. Within it, the ten thousand images arise, the Eight Trigrams transform, and the celestial stems and earthly branches revolve. The divine mechanisms are unfathomable, the hidden workings of ghosts are inscrutable, and the numerology of yin and yang’s mutual overcoming all emerge from within. How luminous—this is a principle visible to all, not some obscure or esoteric matter. It transcends mere images, for images are but the images of the *Yi*.\n\nThe *Taishang Huangting Waijing Jing*\nSecret Manuscript of the Two Perfected Ones, Danxia and Qingxia\nCommentary by Hanxuzi of Zixia Cave, Mount Yuanqiao\n\n**Chapter One**\nLaozi, in leisure, composed seven-character verses,\nExplaining the body’s form and the various spirits.\nAbove lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin,\nBefore the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life.\nBreathing the void into the Cinnabar Field,\nJade Pool’s pure water irrigates the numinous root.\nThe Youth Who Governs the True consumes fetal essence—\nThose who can refine this may endure forever.\n\nThis chapter is the opening hymn of the Lesser Yang Patriarch. The Patriarch said: Lord Lao often recited the Jade Texts, and from the *Neijing Jing*, he distilled the essentials into seven-character verses, still calling it the *Huangting*, but distinguishing it as the *Waijing*. “Inner” and “outer” refer to before and after, not the internal and external of the body. What it expounds are the five forms of the body and the ten thousand spirits within—truly essential teachings.\n\nThe Most High takes emptiness and non-being as the root. Between above and below, before and behind, there exists a circle of emptiness and non-being. Those who can guard this will find their breath deeply entering the Cinnabar Field, nurturing the primordial, utterly pure water in the Jade Pool of another’s household to irrigate their own numinous root. When the numinous root is firm, the foundation of the elixir is established.\n\nThe Youth Who Governs the True is the fetal infant. The fetal infant is the ancestor of the ten thousand spirits. Nurturing it daily, consuming the mysterious essence of fetal breathing—those who refine this may attain immortality. Irrigating the numinous root speaks of nourishing the self with the postnatal; consuming fetal essence speaks of nurturing the elixir with the prenatal. Such is the marvelous meaning of this hymn.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* transmitted in the world omits Laozi’s two lines on leisure and alters the rest into four-character verses: “Above lies the Yellow Court, below the Pass of Origin, before the Dark Gate, behind the Gate of Life. Breathing beyond the hut, entering and exiting the Cinnabar Field—those who can practice this may endure forever.” The line about the Youth Who Governs the True is missing from all versions. Without seeing the true text, one nearly loses the true visage of Mount Lu.\n\nWhen I first intended to annotate the *Huangting*, I was suddenly visited in my mountain studio by the Perfected One Danxia, who said: “I received a letter from Lady Wei, instructing you to collate and annotate the *Huangting*, and to show you the secret manuscript from the Orchid Terrace for a day.” There was a Daoist, Canxia, who obtained a manuscript from Yang, the Prefectural Governor of Nanyue, and sent it to Chipingzi, who then showed it to me. Comparing it with Danxia’s version, I found that the celestial palace’s secret records were indeed identical. Delighted, I recorded this in the annotations.\n\n**Chapter Two**",

in non-action,\nEmbodying emptiness, free of things,\nSilent and vast.\nCultivating the Great Harmony, guarding the center, standing alone—\nThis is called the True Person’s palace.\nSerene and desireless within,\nWandering the garden of virtue, the jade sprout glows resplendent.\nAt this time, purity is untainted, fragrance unstained,\nAnd the Jade Maiden endures.\nThe Jade Maiden is a metaphor for inner mercury.\n*Virtue* is what one receives from Heaven—\nEmpty, numinous, and unobscured,\nPossessing all principles and responding to the myriad things.\nCultivation restores its empty, numinous essence.\n*Goodness* is what Heaven bestows upon humanity—\nThe primal spark,\nThe root of nature and the stem of the heart.\nIlluminating it reveals one’s original truth.\nThe gate of the Great Dao first teaches one to fulfill their nature—\nThis lies in cultivating virtue and illuminating goodness.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Twelve**\nPracticing the Dao in leisure, the body dwells alone,\nNurturing nature and life, guarding emptiness and nothingness.\nSerene and desireless—what thoughts or cares arise?\nWings fully formed, upright and flourishing,\nOne attains long life and enduring vision, then takes flight.\n\n*Practicing the Dao* refers to cultivation.\nThe cultivator, whether in the world or beyond it,\nMust move with ease and contentment,\nGuarding their body and dwelling alone.\nWithin the body lie nature and life—\nOne must daily uphold and nurture them.\nFirst refine jade to illuminate nature,\nThen refine gold to establish life—\nThe essential secret lies in inwardly guarding emptiness and nothingness.\nBorn between Heaven and Earth,\nHumans are beset by thoughts and cares.\nIf one guards emptiness and nothingness,\nThey become serene and desireless,\nActing without action—what thoughts or cares remain?\nThe immortals refine qi to forge wings;\nWhen spirit is complete and qi is full,\nThe wings are formed.\n*Upright and flourishing* describes the flourishing of spirit and qi.\nFrom this, nature is preserved within,\nThe body is fortified without,\nOne may appear or vanish in the world,\nAttaining long life and enduring vision.\nWeary of the dusty realm,\nThey shed their shell and take flight.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen**\nThe Five Phases interweave, sharing a common root and node,\nThree and five unite—essence lies in their oneness.\nWho shares this with the Dipper and Sun-Moon?\nEmbracing the pearl, cherishing the jade, harmonizing the Chamber of the Child.\nIf you can guard the One, all affairs are complete;\nIt is yours to hold—do not lose it.\nIf you wish not to die, conceal it in the golden chamber.\n\n*Interweaving* refers to their intricate interplay.\nIn the Five Phases’ sequence,\nMetal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth generate and nourish one another.\nIn their interweaving,\nMetal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth restrain and regulate each other.\nBetween them, Wood descends and Metal ascends,\nWater presides and Fire serves—\nTheir functions cannot be equalized,\nThus the Five Phases interweave.\nYet when their qi converges,\nThey share a common root and node.\nThree and five unite—\nTheir sum is eight,\nDividing yin and yang,\nFitting the return after seven days.\nTracing their origin,\nThey arise from the void, generating the One qi.\nThis One qi produces yin and yang—\nThus their essence lies in oneness.\nThis One qi is nurtured in emptiness.\n*Who shares this?* The Northern Dipper and the Two Luminaries.\nThe Dipper’s handle and scoop move with the stars to mark time,\nThe Sun of Li and Moon of Kan—\nWater and Fire dwell in the same palace, refining together.\nI merely embrace the bright pearl,\nCherish the fine jade,\nAnd cultivate harmony in the Chamber of the Child.\nThe Chamber of the Child is emptiness.\nIf you can guard the One qi of emptiness,\nAwaiting its arrival to seize it,\nThen nature and life are yours—\nAll affairs are complete.\nThe One is a thing you inherently possess—\nSimply hold it firmly and do not lose it.\nLose it, and you die;\nRetain it, and you do not die.\nIf you wish not to die,\nYou must conceal this One within the golden chamber,\nNever parting from it—\nThus the Great Elixir is accomplished.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen**\nEmerging with the sun, entering with the moon—this is my Dao,\nHeaven’s seven and Earth’s two guard together.\nAscending and descending, advancing and retreating—one unites with nine,\nJade and stone gleaming—this is my treasure.\nYou possess it yourself—why not guard it?\n\nThe heart understands the root and stem, nurturing radiant splendor,\nServing Heaven and following Earth, concealing the sea of essence.\nWithin seven days, they return and unite,\nThe nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.\n\n*Emerging with the sun, entering with the moon* describes the path of yang departing and yin arriving—\nThus it is my Dao.\n*Heaven’s seven* is the fire’s completion number.\nFire completes in Heaven, descending from above—\nThe hexagram *Wei Ji* (Before Completion).\n*Earth’s two* is the fire’s generating number,\nFire arises from Earth, ascending from below—\nThe hexagram *Ji Ji* (After Completion).\nThese two hexagrams guard one another—\nThis is the work of Metal and Water.\n*Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating* refer to above and below.\n*One unites with nine*—Metal and Water must not part.\nAdvancing, Water’s Metal ascends;\nRetreating, Metal’s Water descends—\nThis is the wonder of augmentation and reduction.\n*Jade and stone gleaming* compares the golden liquid,\nDroplet by droplet, like eggs or pills,\nDescending the throat—\nThe supreme treasure of my body.\nThe Golden Liquid Returned Elixir is inherent in everyone—\nHaving attained it, how could one not guard it?\nThe work of guarding it is to deepen the root and firm the stem.\nThose who understand this Dao know no method more wondrous than the heart.\nWhen the heart comprehends the root and stem,\nIt nurtures the Returned Elixir with Metal and Water—\nGlowing brilliantly, gradually producing radiant splendor.\nThis method requires only serving Qian Heaven,\nFollowing Kun Earth,\nActing in accord with Heaven’s timing,\nAnd concealing the sea of essence.\nWithin seven days, they return and unite,\nThe nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.",

      "translated_text": "The Sea of Essence is the Primordial Sea. Within the seven days of returning and uniting, the revolving celestial cycle rises into the inner courtyard, merging with the elixir already conjoined within me. It is nurtured in the Central Kunlun and harmonized in the Upper Kunlun, where emptiness becomes clarity and the original nature shines with perfect brightness. Thus it is said, \"The nature of Kunlun remains unconfused.\"\n\n**Chapter Fifteen**\nHow towering stands the Mountain of Nine Springs!\nWithin it dwells a true person who may be summoned.\nShielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower,\nFlanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls.\nFor ten thousand years, its radiance shines without end—\nExternally, the Three Yang substances arrive of themselves;\nInternally, nurturing the Three Spirits grants longevity.\nWhen the hun-soul longs for heaven and the po-soul sinks into the abyss,\nTo return the hun and restore the po is the Dao’s natural way,\nThat one may form the pearl and secure the numinous root.\n\nThe Nine Springs are the Nine Liquid Sources spoken of in the *Inner Landscape*. Nine is Metal; the source is Water. The preceding text spoke of the function of Metal and Water; this chapter speaks of their root. The Nine Springs lie within the Lower Kunlun, hence \"the Mountain of Nine Springs.\" *Tingting* describes the mountain’s height. Within the mountain dwells a true person, named the Mysterious Dark Youth or Peach Vitality, who may be employed as a servant. \"Shielded by the Crimson Palace and the Elixir City Tower, flanked by the sun and moon like luminous pearls\" describes the strictness of its protection. When protection is strict, the inner fire remains pure, and the immortal Dao may be attained. \"For ten thousand years, its radiance shines\"—enduring brightness and prolonged vision cannot be measured by any fixed term. This is the joy of the Great Return.\n\nWhen one first refines the elixir within and establishes the crucible without, Qian’s Three Yang and Kun’s Three Yin are inverted, host and guest intermingled. When Qian enters Kun, the Three Yang lie externally, and in an instant, the primordial single entity arrives of itself, unbidden—this is called \"lead within water.\" With lead, one restrains mercury; from without, one returns within, gathering essence to nurture spirit, using the Three Yang to replenish the Three Yin, restoring the Qian body and thereby achieving longevity. The Three Spirits are the Three Yin. To nurture the Three Spirits internally is to subdue the outer elixir with the inner elixir. Once the inner elixir is subdued, clarity and stability prevail, and one may attain long life. Those who do not attain long life, at the moment of death, find their hun-soul longing for heaven and their po-soul sinking into the abyss—hun and po estranged, lead and mercury each following their own path. To return the hun and restore the po is to draw the hun downward when it seeks to ascend and raise the po upward when it seeks to descend, so that hun and po constrain one another. As the *Awakening to Reality* says, \"The earthly po seizes the cinnabar mercury; the celestial hun restrains the watery metal.\" This is the natural affair of the Great Dao. When elixir refinement reaches this point, one may nearly have formed the luminous pearl, forever securing the wondrous root and becoming an immortal.",

The qi ascending above the Celestial Gate is \"pure\"; the qi descending below the Celestial Gate is \"mysterious.\" As the *Inner Landscape* states: \"Emerging pure, entering mysterious—these two qi shine forth.\" Thus, one must concentrate the spirit and still the breath, returning to sit at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the separation of yin and yang. When the pure ascends and the mysterious descends, then the cold spring drips drop by drop, flowing down the throat to connect with the divine luminosity. Passing through the floral canopy, it is clear and cool; entering the deep abyss, it is crystalline and cold. It washes the heart and purifies thoughts, revealing my true form—serene and desireless. This is called the Returned Elixir. Once the Returned Elixir is achieved, one may attain longevity.\n\nBefore the Golden Elixir returns, below lies the Floral Pool, called the Sea of Qi. The essence within the kidneys stirs here; I stand in the Hall of Light to observe it, illuminating the Cinnabar Field. This is the Office of the General, governing plans and deliberations. The General’s intent is to command all spirits to open the Life Gate, dredging the celestial Dao to reach the numinous root. Then yin and yang array themselves swiftly as shooting stars.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-One**\nThe lungs govern the qi; the Triple Burner arises,\nConcealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path.\nThe pure fluid, sweet spring, flows through the six viscera,\nFollowing the nose up and down, known to both ears.\nGazing inward at heaven and earth, the Youth is preserved;\nHarmonizing essence and brilliance, teeth and hair are moistened.\nThe complexion glows, radiant without medicine,\nAs the fluid descends the throat—how freely it falls!\nAll spirits gather, seeking one another;\nBelow, in the Crimson Palace, purple blossoms unfold.\nHidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut,\nFocusing the heart-spirit, calling to one another.\nObserving my divine luminosity, it repels all evil,\nThe spleen-spirit returns to its great home.\nReaching the stomach’s passage, it connects to emptiness,\nNurturing the numinous root, never to wither again.\nSealing the Life Gate like a jade capital,\nLongevity extends ten thousand years and more.\n\nThe opening line refers to the internal commentary. To cultivate the lung qi, one must first lie concealed at the Celestial Gate, awaiting the old path of ingress and egress. When qi transforms into water, the pure fluid, sweet spring, irrigates the six viscera. This qi, following the nose up and down, bridges the magpie bridge—above as qi, below as fluid. The sound of flowing springs is heard in the void, known to the two ears. Through the work of inner illumination, one gazes at the ascent and descent of heaven and earth, preserving the White Prime Youth to assist the six qi. Harmonizing the essence of the entire body, it moistens teeth and hair, brightens the complexion, and eliminates the need for medicine. The fluid descends the throat like scattered rain; all spirits seek it, and each viscus partakes of its sweetness. Below lies the Crimson Palace, where purple blossoms unfold along the trickling stream. Hidden beneath the floral canopy, it connects to the divine hut. Heart and spirit are two yet one. By focusing the heart-spirit, one ensures the heart calls to the spirit, the spirit calls to the heart—now in the heart, now in the spleen—ever luminous, never dim. Observing my divine luminosity, it truly repels all evil influences. In the spleen, the spleen-spirit returns as if home, always abiding there. Reaching the passage of the stomach, it connects to the realm of emptiness, nurturing the numinous root so it never withers again. All this is the cultivation of lung qi. Yet in this nurturing, one must seal the Life Gate, pure as a jade capital, untouched by dust, all thoughts stilled. Thus the numinous root is fortified, and longevity extends ten thousand years with abundance.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe spirit within the spleen governs the center,\nSummoning the five spirits to harmonize the Three Lights.\nAbove, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light,\nDredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases.\nMetal, wood, water, fire, earth reign as kings;\nSun, moon, and constellations array yin and yang.\nDredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar;\nCultivating the seven apertures dispels misfortune.\nThe two spirits unite to descend jade blossoms,\nReceiving primordial qi, the years grow ever longer.\n\nThe spleen belongs to earth, so its spirit presides over the center. \"Summoning the five spirits\" means gathering the Five Phases; \"harmonizing the Three Lights\" refers to the revolutions of the Dipper, sun, and moon.",

      "translated_text": "**Continuation of Chapter Twenty-Two**\nThe phrase *\"Above, it joins the Celestial Gate and meets the Hall of Light\"* distills the wondrous workings of the preceding two chapters. The Mysterious Gate awaits the Dao of Heaven—this is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits yin and yang—this, too, is the spirit of the spleen. The Celestial Gate awaits the ancient Way—still, it is the spirit of the spleen. *\"Meeting the Hall of Light\"* refers not to the Hall of Light between the brows nor the Crimson Palace, but to the central void of nonbeing. *\"Dredging the six viscera and regulating the Five Phases\"*—among metal, wood, water, and fire, earth reigns as king. The sun, moon, and constellations harbor yin and yang within; who divides them? The spleen’s spirit governs their unfolding. *\"Dredging the blood vessels, sweat becomes nectar\"* and *\"cultivating the seven apertures to dispel misfortune\"*—all depend on the spleen’s spirit establishing the center, for intention arises from the heart. The *\"two spirits\"* are the spleen’s spirit and the heart’s spirit. *\"Uniting\"* means the two become one. *\"Descending jade blossoms\"* signifies jade liquid irrigating the heart, as earth also generates the yellow sprout. *\"Receiving primordial qi\"* means using qi to nourish spirit, for spirit relies on qi; when qi is full, spirit is complete, and the years grow ever longer.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\nAmong the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank,\nConcealed in the Great Yin, they safeguard their truth.\nExiting and entering through the two apertures, they merge with the Yellow Court,\nInhaling and exhaling the void, my form becomes visible.\nThey strengthen my sinews and bones, enriching blood and vessels,\nIn the indistinct and imperceptible, I transcend to pure numinosity.\nSeated within the hut, I observe the youth,\nWith inner breath and focused thought, the light of spirit shines.\nEmerging from the Celestial Gate, I enter the boundless,\nSerene and desireless, I nurture the root of radiance.\nIngesting primordial qi grants longevity,\nReturning to the Seven Gates, I drink from the Great Abyss.\nPassing through the Mysterious Throat, I traverse pure numinosity,\nSeated within the hut, I behold the youth.\nHe asks me of the immortal Dao and wondrous methods—\nI tell him to consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom,\nTo wear white silk upon his head, his feet planted at the Cinnabar Field,\nTo bathe in the Flowery Pond and irrigate the numinous root.\nWhen the five viscera harmonize, the Gate of Life opens,\nThe five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns.\nPracticing this with unbound hair ensures enduring existence.\n\n*The Outer Radiance* concludes the five viscera with the kidneys, returning all to the One. The One is water, governed by the kidneys, so among the five viscera, the kidneys hold the highest rank. The Great Yin belongs to the lungs; *\"concealed in the Great Yin\"* means true metal generates true water, and true water conceals true metal. *\"Exiting and entering through the two apertures\"* refers to the gates of Qian and Kun, the doors of yin and yang—one metal, one water, one going forth, one returning. Their center is called the Yellow Court, the place where metal and water are stored and where exit and entry converge. The center is emptiness; emptiness is nonbeing. Guarding the center in breath, one takes the space between heaven and earth as a bellows, vibrant and fluid, vast and boundless, subtle and continuous, merging into a single whole—round and luminous, with qi and spirit full, so that one’s true form becomes visible. Thereafter, the sinews and bones grow strong, the blood and vessels flourish, and in the indistinct and imperceptible, one’s form vanishes, soaring beyond the realm of pure numinosity to ascend to the Central Elixir. This is the hut of spirit’s light. Seated beneath it, one observes a youth whose appearance mirrors one’s own—yet pay him no mind. Simply guard the inner breath, focus the thought, and the celestial light of wisdom will shine forth, the spirit growing ever brighter. From there, move the spirit to the Upper Elixir, emerging above the Celestial Gate to commune with the single qi of heaven and earth, vast and boundless, clear and empty—this is me yet not me, this is emptiness yet not emptiness. In harmony with the Dao, one enters the boundless, serene and desireless, nurturing the root of radiance. The root of radiance is the immortal seed; immortals abstain from grain, ingesting only the qi of the Mysterious Gate to attain undying longevity. Yet those who consume primordial qi must also guide the spirit inward, returning to the Seven Gates to drink daily from the Great Abyss. In returning, one takes the path of the Mysterious Throat, passing through pure numinosity to sit once more within the hut, where the youth appears again, asking of the immortal Dao and its wondrous methods. I tell him: there is no other wonder. Simply consume the purple blossoms of the magic mushroom, wear white silk upon your head, plant your feet at the Cinnabar Field, bathe in the Flowery Pond, and irrigate the numinous root. When the five viscera harmonize and a single qi surges in harmony, the Gate of Life opens, the elixir light emerges from the crucible, the five flavors all arrive, and good qi returns to the body. Practicing this with unbound hair—obtaining the medicine, laying the foundation, refining the self, returning the elixir, ascending to the origin, returning to the root, illuminating goodness, and reverting to the beginning—all lies within these few words. This is the immortal Dao and its wondrous method, ensuring enduring existence.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThe great Dao flows boundlessly—let not the heart grow tangled.\nMy words are complete; do not recklessly expound them.\n\nHere, Laozi concludes his scripture with two closing exhortations: All that has been spoken above is the great Dao—vast and unobstructed, utterly upright, without crooked paths or deviant byways. Those who practice it must not let their hearts become entangled in complexity and stray onto divergent paths. My words are complete; do not recklessly expound them to the unworthy, lest you bring calamity upon yourself. Treasure and remember them.\n\n**Explanation of the *Classic of Purity***\nLaozi said: The great Dao is formless, giving birth to heaven and earth.\nThe Limitless generates the Supreme Ultimate.\nThe great Dao is passionless, revolving the sun and moon.\nIt is non-doing, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe great Dao is nameless, nurturing the myriad things.\nNonbeing gives birth to being.\nI know not its name, so I forcefully call it *\"Dao.\"*\nThe character for *\"Dao\"* is formed by combining *\"head\"* and *\"walk\"*—it moves and generates prior to heaven and earth. Though called a forced name, it is nonetheless natural.\nThe Dao possesses purity and turbidity, movement and stillness.\nWithout pure heaven and turbid earth, there would be no heaven’s movement and earth’s stillness.\nMan is pure, woman turbid; man is active, woman still.\nDescending from the root, flowing to the branches, the myriad things are born.\nPurity and movement are the root; turbidity and stillness are the branches.\nOne descends, one flows, one bestows, one receives.\nWhen purity and turbidity merge, movement and stillness unite in marriage, the myriad things flourish therefrom.",

      "translated_text": "Dwelling at the center and revolving—this is called the *pivot*. The first star of the Northern Dipper is named *Celestial Pivot*, for it revolves from the center. In the human body, the spirit serves as the pivot; when not a speck of dust clings to it, it is as luminously pure as jade—hence the name *Jade Pivot*. The great purport of this scripture is to teach people to refine the primordial spirit.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: “You, all gods and humans, wish to hear the supreme Dao. The supreme Dao is profoundly subtle, not to be found elsewhere. Since you wish to hear it, the one who does not hear is the one. Without hearing, without seeing—this is the true Dao. Even hearing and seeing must be dissolved; only you remain, yet you are not a thing, how much less so this?”\n\nClear as ice and bright as snow, no further explanation is needed. The word *this* refers to hearing, seeing, and speech.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is entered through sincerity, preserved through silence, and employed through softness. Employing sincerity appears as foolishness; employing silence appears as inarticulateness; employing softness appears as clumsiness. Thus one may forget form, may forget even forgetting. All these are the workings within emptiness and nothingness.\n\nThose who enter the Dao know when to stop; those who preserve the Dao know how to be reverent; those who employ the Dao know subtlety. Knowing subtlety, wisdom-light arises; knowing reverence, sagely wisdom is complete; knowing when to stop, great stability and peace are attained. With great stability and peace, sagely wisdom is complete; with sagely wisdom complete, wisdom-light arises; with wisdom-light arising, one becomes one with the Dao—this is called true forgetting.\n\nOnly in forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten, does the supreme Dao reside. The Dao pervades heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know it. Sentient and insentient beings are ultimately one and without duality.”\n\nTo enter, one must be able to preserve; to preserve, one must be able to employ. Knowing when to stop, one does not stray; knowing reverence, one does not deviate; knowing subtlety, one deeply enters the profound and obscure. From the profound and obscure arises the indistinct and vague, where numinous awareness attaches—this is wisdom-light. Not deviating, the spirit is tranquil; not straying, qi is still. When qi is still, the spirit is tranquil; when the spirit is tranquil, within the Great Void a single spirit moves alone, knowing only the Dao and nothing else—thus it is said: “This is called true forgetting.” True forgetting is forgetting yet not forgetting, where nothing remains to be forgotten. True forgetting is the supreme Dao.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: “In this present world, how shall I benefit living beings? For all gods and humans, I expound this wondrous treasure. Those who awaken to it shall ascend to the immortal’s throne.\n\nDisciples of the Dao, know that there is *qi* and *number*. As wind and earth differ, so too do endowments naturally vary—hence it is called *qi*. As wisdom and foolishness differ, so too do purity and turbidity naturally vary—hence it is called *number*. Number is tied to destiny; qi is tied to heaven. Constrained by qi and number, destiny is bound (bound, as in fettered), and the true Dao cannot be attained. Foolishness may become wisdom; turbidity may become purity—only destiny decrees it. Foolishness is dim; turbidity is dark—these too are shaped by the endowments of wind and earth, which shift and transform.\n\nHeaven and earth move their mechanism, causing people not to know—this is called *spontaneity*. Even when one knows that one does not know, it is still called *spontaneity*. The wonder of spontaneity, though wondrous in knowing, arises precisely from not knowing. Yet in relation to the Dao, it has never begun with foolishness or turbidity.”\n\nAll gods heard this, and the four assemblies rejoiced.\n\n*Summary of the Scripture on Protecting Life*",

      "translated_text": "At that time, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was within the Fivefold-Luminous Palace of the Seven-Jewel Grove, together with the boundless assembly of sages, radiating boundless light that illuminated the boundless worlds. He beheld the boundless sentient beings enduring boundless suffering, tossed and turned in the world, revolving through birth and death, adrift in the river of love, blown about in the sea of desire, sunk in the mire of sound and form, deluded by existence and non-existence. There is no emptiness, yet emptiness; no form, yet form; no non-existence, yet non-existence. There is existence, yet no existence. From beginning to end, all is dark and obscure, unable to illumine themselves, utterly lost in delusion.\n\nThe beginningless is the ancestral qi. When ancestral qi transforms and engenders, the true spirit is revealed. This spirit resides within the heart of heaven, inside the Yellow Court. When the one spirit is rightly positioned, the ten thousand spirits pay homage. It is not like the boundless sentient beings, who are all but a single stream of consciousness-spirit, enduring endless suffering in the destinies. Those sentient beings are all clinging to delusion. Clinging to emptiness is wrong; clinging to form is wrong; clinging to existence within non-existence is wrong; clinging to non-existence within existence is also wrong. How pitiable indeed!\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy declared: “You sentient beings arise from non-existence into existence, from non-nothingness into nothingness, from non-form into form, from non-emptiness into emptiness. Existence is not made existence; nothingness is not made nothingness; form is not made form; emptiness is not made emptiness. Emptiness is just emptiness, yet emptiness has no fixed emptiness. Form is just form, yet form has no fixed form. Form is emptiness; emptiness is form. If you can know that emptiness is not emptiness and that form is not form, this is called illumination, the beginning of attaining the wondrous sound. Recognizing the dharma of no-emptiness, perceiving without obstruction, entering the gate of manifold wonders, you will naturally awaken. Free from the net of doubts, not attached to the view of emptiness—this passage breaks through the delusion of emptiness, form, existence, and non-existence for sentient beings. If any sentient being awakens to this, they will be able to leave all delusions behind. Purifying the six senses, cutting off evil obstructions, I shall then expound for you this wondrous scripture, called *Protecting Life*. It delivers and saves sentient beings, spreads the teaching in the world, and circulates through recitation. Then flying heavenly deities, vajra warriors who shatter evil, dharma-protecting spirit youths, deliverers from suffering, golden-eyed fierce beasts—each in hundreds of millions—will all attend and guard this scripture. Wherever it is revered, they will ward off danger, support the weak, and deliver all sentient beings from defilements and attachments.”\n\nThis passage emphasizes purity once more. Only by purifying the six senses can one attain this wondrous treasure of *Protecting Life* and leave behind all suffering.\n\nAt that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke a gatha:\n*“Seeing yet not seeing me,\nHearing yet not hearing me.\nDeparting from all extremes—\nThis is called the wondrous Dao.”*\n\nNot seeing me, not hearing me—then there is no self. The self is the harm of all extremes; without self, all extremes are departed. Confucius had no prejudices, no inflexibility, no obstinacy, and thus returned to no-self. For with no-self, prejudices, inflexibility, and obstinacy all cease.\n\n*Summary of the Scripture on Daily Practice*\nDaily practice refers to what cannot be departed from even for a moment in the twelve hours. Where there is effort, there will be efficacy—all depends on purifying body and mind. The scripture contains two passages: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity,” and at the end: “In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” This is the crucial point for the followers of the Most High, hence it is reiterated. In the twelve hours, purity must constantly be cultivated as the foundation of daily practice. The scripture’s language is clear and requires no further annotation.\n\nRespectfully noted by Xiyue of the Mysterious Lineage.\n\nAs for daily practice: when eating and drinking, be settled. Seal the mouth, sit upright, and do not arouse a single thought. Forget all things, preserve the spirit, and stabilize the intent. The eyes do not see objects; the ears do not hear sounds. The mind is inwardly guarded, regulating the breath continuously, exhaling gently without interruption, as if present yet absent. Naturally, the heart-fire descends, the kidney-water ascends, saliva is generated in the mouth, and the numinous true essence attaches to the body, attaining the path to longevity.\n\nThe first passage speaks of the initial effort: “In the twelve hours, constantly contemplate purity.” Not arousing a single thought is called purity; the numinous terrace being empty of things is called clarity. The body is the dwelling of qi; the mind is the abode of spirit. Where intent moves, spirit moves; where spirit moves, qi scatters. When spirit gathers, the five phases’ true qi coalesces into the elixir pellet, and naturally, within the body there is another body. The harmonious qi penetrates, and the finest essence showers upon the crown. In movement, stillness, sitting, and lying down, one constantly feels the body as if the wind is passing, the abdomen as if thunder is rumbling, the ears hearing the music of immortals without strings. Without speech, there is sound; without striking, there is resonance. Spirit and qi intertwine, the infant revolves. One perceives inner visions, can speak of oneself, sees the affairs of the formless, and dwells with the sages. Spirit moves in and out freely, and one’s lifespan equals heaven and earth, transcending birth and death.\n\nThe two lines “In the twelve hours” refer to the time of entering the chamber, when body and mind are pure, and efficacy naturally manifests. All that follows lies within these two lines. Do not allow any harm—“In the twelve hours, constantly maintain purity.” Spirit is the child of qi; qi is the mother of spirit. Like a hen brooding over her eggs, can one preserve spirit and nurture qi without separation? Wondrous! Wondrous!",

      "translated_text": "Purple Radiance Permeating the Void Master respectfully expounds *Concentrated Contemplation*, which embodies the Buddhist principle of *śamatha-vipaśyanā*. Contemplation here encompasses internal observation, external observation, distant observation, and observation of emptiness. If one can practice concentrated contemplation, the spirit remains unshaken, enabling internal observation of the mindless, external observation of the formless, distant observation of the objectless, and observation of emptiness as emptiness itself.\n\n*The Complete Collection of Daoist Texts* includes annotations by Master Harmonious Simplicity, but his explanations are fragmented and fail to clarify the essential meaning. Here, the exposition follows the original scriptural intent.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed Left Mystery Perfected One, saying: \"Left\" (zuǒ) means to assist, to aid—one who assists in the mysterious work. As the *Book of Documents* states, \"The Duke of Zhou assisted the former kings,\" where \"assist\" (zuǒ) is read in the departing tone, meaning \"to aid.\" If one wishes to cultivate the Dao, one must first relinquish worldly affairs. Sever all external matters that conflict with the heart—external matters being those unrelated to body and mind. \"Conflict\" (wǔ) means opposition, which breeds affliction; thus, one must first abandon and entirely sever such matters to prevent the arising of afflictive thoughts. Only then may one sit in tranquility and inwardly observe the arising of the mind. If even a single thought arises, it must be eradicated to ensure stillness. Here, \"thought\" refers to those with attachment. As Buddhist scriptures state, one must work at the point where the mind stirs and thoughts arise; thus, they must be removed and extinguished. Even if the thoughts are not explicitly attached but are merely wandering and chaotic, they too must be entirely eradicated. One must practice diligently day and night without the slightest lapse.\n\n\"Explicit attachment\" refers to the aforementioned \"thoughts,\" such as those for fame and profit. \"Wandering and chaotic thoughts\" are those without attachment, arising aimlessly, drifting and ceaseless, disordered and inconsequential. \"Lapse\" means abandonment. One must extinguish the moving mind but not the illuminating mind. One should congeal the empty mind but not fixate the abiding mind. Without relying on any single method, the mind remains constantly settled. \"Thought\" is the moving mind; \"illumination\" is the mind of reflexive observation; \"emptiness\" is the desireless mind; \"abiding\" is the mind of attachment. \"Not relying on any single method\" means that all things are empty, yet the mind remains perpetually settled.\n\nHowever, the mundane mind is restless and competitive. To conclude the above: For beginners, calming the mind is exceedingly difficult. Even if one momentarily succeeds, the mind soon strays again. The struggle between departure and retention causes the entire body to circulate restlessly. Only through prolonged and focused reflection can one achieve mastery. Do not abandon the endeavor of a thousand lifetimes because of a momentary failure to collect the mind. \"Calming the mind\" is what Buddhists call \"pacifying the mind.\" \"Momentarily succeeding but soon straying\" is what Confucians describe as \"maintaining when present, losing when absent.\" When lost, it departs; when departed, it is drawn by external conditions. When maintained, it remains; when it remains, it returns to the mind. The interplay of mind and conditions resembles a battle. Following the breath's ebb and flow, it is said: \"The hundred parts of the body circulate.\" To achieve the method of retention, one must ponder the principle of harmonizing the mind. There is nothing that does not proceed from the temporary to the constant; through prolonged and focused reflection, one can achieve mastery. Initially, one may temporarily collect the mind, but subsequently, it abides constantly. The endeavor of a thousand lifetimes refers to the constantly abiding mind mentioned above.\n\nOnce one has attained a measure of stillness, then in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down—in all places of engagement and amidst clamor—one must intentionally cultivate calm. Whether occupied or unoccupied, one should remain as if mindless. In quietude or in noise, one's resolve should be singular. \"Measure\" means \"slightly\"; \"attained\" means \"ceased.\" Having slightly attained stillness, one must test it in various conditions to observe whether the mind remains unmoved. Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, quietude, and noise—all are conditions. \"Intentionally\" means to establish and maintain. The four phrases regarding occupation, non-occupation, movement, and noise all describe intentional effort.\n\nIf one binds the mind too tightly, the tension may cause illness. The arising of qi may lead to madness and frenzy—these are its symptoms. The mind tends toward movement, and restraining it too forcefully will result in violent and agitated illness. Qi here refers to the qi within the mind; when the mind moves, qi moves. \"Madness\" is the symptom of violence; \"frenzy\" is the symptom of agitation. Madness is minor; violence and agitation are severe. If the mind does not move, one must allow it freedom. When tension and relaxation are balanced, one naturally remains harmoniously adjusted. To restrain without attachment, to release without movement, to remain unperturbed in noise, and to remain unagitated in engagement—this is true concentration. \"Balanced\" means appropriate. \"Naturally harmoniously adjusted\" means to be at ease, free, and unhurried. \"Without attachment or movement\" is the balance of tension and relaxation. \"Unperturbed and unagitated\" is natural harmony. \"True concentration\" is perpetual stillness.\n\nDo not seek more engagement because one remains unagitated amidst affairs, nor seek noise because one remains unperturbed in clamor. Regard the absence of affairs as one's true dwelling and the presence of affairs as responsive traces. Like water or a mirror serving as a reflection, one manifests forms in accordance with things. Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration. How can one know that seeking more affairs will not generate agitation, or that forcibly seeking noise will not produce perturbation? \"True dwelling\" refers to the realm of stillness; \"responsive traces\" refers to the realm of movement. \"Skillful means\" means responding to things with the mind, which is the responsive trace. Constant response and constant stillness both aim to achieve the work of concentration. Thus, it is said: \"Skillful means alone enable entry into concentration.\"\n\nThe arising of wisdom may be swift or slow, but this does not depend on the individual. Do not urgently seek wisdom within concentration, for urgency harms one's nature, and harm precludes wisdom. If, without seeking wisdom in concentration, wisdom arises naturally, such concentration is called true wisdom. If wisdom is not employed, true insight resembles foolishness, further enriching concentration and wisdom, both of which attain boundless excellence. Wisdom arises from concentration and follows its natural course. To use wisdom is not wisdom; not using it is wisdom. Cultivating both concentration and wisdom brings limitless joy.\n\nIf thoughts arise during concentration, one may attract numerous demonic influences. Malevolent spirits and myriad specters will manifest in accordance with the mind. The visions of Heavenly Worthies, immortals, and venerable figures are auspicious signs.",

      "translated_text": "Signs: omens. Ancient scholars distinguished between auspicious signs and ominous signs; here, the latter is meant. Only when the mind in concentration is suddenly open and unobstructed above, vast and foundationless below, will past karma daily dissolve and new karma cease to form. Unentangled and free, one escapes the cage of the dusty world. With long practice, the Dao is naturally attained. Above, no obstruction; below, no foundation—nothing but emptiness. This represents an advanced stage in concentration practice, echoing the earlier scripture’s teaching: “Observe emptiness as empty; how can desire arise?”\n\nThose who attain the Dao exhibit seven progressive signs. First, the mind easily enters concentration (governs itself), becoming aware of all sensory leaks. Second, chronic illnesses vanish entirely, and body and mind feel light and refreshed. Third, premature depletion is replenished, restoring vitality and lifespan. Fourth, one lives for thousands of years, known as an immortal. Fifth, one refines form into qi, known as a perfected person. Sixth, one refines qi into spirit, known as a spirit person. Seventh, one refines spirit to merge with the Dao, known as a realized person. Discernment sharpens with each stage. Upon attaining the supreme Dao, wisdom becomes complete—completeness meaning all seven stages have been traversed.\n\nIf, after long practice in concentration, the body shows none of these signs—if one’s brief, impure life fades and perishes, yet claims to possess awakened wisdom or to have attained the Dao—then the principles of the Dao remain unrealized.\n\nA verse explains:\nKnowing arises from conditions,\nas fire arises from causes.\nEach is the movement of true nature,\nyet following the current, the source of the Dao is lost.\nStriving to still knowing with the mind,\nknowing arises and the mind grows more troubled.\nRealizing that nature is fundamentally empty,\nknowing becomes the gateway to all wonders.\n\nThis scripture guides people in cultivating the mind to enter the Dao, its compassion thorough and all-embracing. Here, the meaning is elucidated in accordance with the text to reveal its earnest intent.\n\n*Inscription by Hanxu*\n\n**Commentary on the *Five Kitchens Sutra***\n*(The sutra employs a five-character classical verse structure, which is highly intricate, hence this detailed exposition.)*\n\n**Original text annotated by Shi Zihanxu**\n\nThe Tang dynasty Perfected Master Yin Min of the Su Ming Abbey in the capital stated: “When one preserves the primordial qi in harmonious balance, the five viscera become full and the five spirits settle into correctness. When the five viscera are full, flavors are sufficient; when the five spirits are settled, cravings disappear.” This scripture addresses the nourishment of the five viscera, as if seeking food from a kitchen—hence the title *Five Kitchens*.\n\nWhen the primordial qi is harmoniously balanced, the One Dao is entirely at peace. Harmony itself is without singular harmony, its profound principle merging with the profound boundary. The “primordial qi” refers to the precelestial One Qi. “Harmonious balance” means uniting the disharmonious qi within the five viscera. Once the qi of the five viscera is harmonized, the One Qi becomes the Dao’s qi, and thus the entire body is pervaded by harmonious qi. When the body is filled with harmonious qi, that qi circulates fully, vast and boundless, leaving no singular harmony to be named.\n\nPrinciple: nature, wherein life resides. Boundary: intersection, where two profundities cannot be separated. When the profound intersects with the profound, each rectifies its nature and life, preserving the Great Harmony.\n\nDo not employ the mind to pursue thought, nor seek thoughtlessness. When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus. The latter “mind” refers to true intention—wisdom’s light. “Do not employ the mind to pursue thought” means that at the intersection of the two profundities, the arising of wisdom is not subject to human control; one must not urgently seek wisdom in concentration. Yet neither should one seek thoughtlessness. Instead, one should attend to the center of the circle, forgetting yet not forgetting, not forgetting yet forgetting. In the space between intention and non-intention, the One Qi arises and wisdom’s light appears—this is the proper practice. Thus it is said: “When the mind is without thought, uphold the Dharma thus.”\n\nDo not use the mind to contemplate the mind,\nnor cling to the absence of contemplation.\nWhen the mind is present, do not fixate on the mind;\nin truth, guard the abyss of truth.\n\nDo not use the inwardly illuminating mind to externally contemplate the mind of human desire, so that inner thoughts do not leak out and outer thoughts do not intrude. Having established a mind free from external contemplation, do not cling to the mind of absolute detachment. This means one must allow for appropriate flexibility, naturally adjusting, regulating without attachment, releasing without disturbance. The mind resides within, yet do not fixate on a mind that is within, lest it become bound by the Dharma. Simply abide in true constancy, silently guarding the deep abyss—what the *Cantong Qi* calls “floating and wandering, guarding the center of the circle.”\n\nCultivate principle, detach from intention;\naccumulated cultivation does not align with detachment.\nWhen intention is not cultivated,\none’s own karma remains unknown.\n\nIn cultivating one’s nature, first uphold intention, then detach from it. Upholding intention ensures focus; detaching from it entrusts intention to emptiness. If one forcefully cultivates nature by rigidly upholding intention, this is called an extreme view, inevitably leading to fixation and conflicting with the principle of detachment. To uphold intention without upholding it, to maintain it subtly—this is the cultivation of one’s own karma, free from personal views, naturally at ease, tranquil and effortless, thus achieving purity and non-action.\n\nAll who consume qi bind qi,\nbut not those who have long stabilized it.\nQi returns to its original qi;\ntake it as it comes, release it as it goes.\n\nThe *Yellow Court Scripture* states: “All people consume grains and the five flavors, but only the perfected consume the harmonious qi of yin and yang.” From this, we understand that those who consume flavors to nourish qi merely sustain temporarily bound qi, which waxes and wanes—unlike the harmonious qi of the One, which abides long and stabilizes within. Within the five viscera, each possesses harmony as its foundation. The realized person gathers the five qi into a cauldron. When the One Qi arises within the cauldron, it returns to the source of each qi. I take it as it comes and release it as it goes. Taking it, the five qi return to the origin; releasing it, the hundred bones are all regulated.",

Its essence lies in quicksilver alone; its method begins with the death of quicksilver, and its foundation lies in first refining the true earth. The Most High, in great compassion, has directly inscribed the essential principles of the Great Elixir upon bamboo and silk. If one can reach the heavens with utmost sincerity, a Perfected One of the Great Clarity will surely break open these subtle words, and all methods will become clear. The laws of immortality are most strict; I dare not rashly annotate them. I humbly reveal the essential wonders of the true scripture within these marks and circles.\n\nThe world does not recognize the One—yet from the One Qi, the myriad things are born. If one knows the One and pursues it, attaining the One, all affairs are complete.\n\nThe One is the foundation of water, continuing as the Wood of the East. *Gui*-lead gives rise to *Xin*-metal, white and lustrous as jade. The Two is the essence of fire, unerringly the father of the *Geng* direction. *Ren*-water generates yellow gold, and gold becomes the Earth of the Central Palace. Yellow gold is the father of cinnabar; white gold is the mother of quicksilver. The essence of *Ren* and *Gui* waters—recognize them as *Wu* and *Ji*. Black lead is not true lead, for within it lies the primordial water. Cinnabar is not true mercury, for within it lies the mysterious primordial fire. When water and fire achieve mutual completion, they do not stray from the Earth of the *Kun* direction. The true mother, if not spiritually attuned, must be supplemented with the correct yang. Extracting *Kan* to restore *Li*, all things return to the primordial ancestor.\n\nThe *Kun* mother nurtures the infant boy; the *Qian* father nurtures the pregnant girl. The maiden weds the infant boy, and they unite as husband and wife. Water and fire coalesce into a single mass, and the couple naturally regard each other. Male and female then conjoin their essences, and from their union, sons and daughters are born. Without a father, a mother cannot form; without a mother, a father is not permitted. When father and mother embody the true form, they do not lose the true Dragon and Tiger. Dragon and Tiger are the Yellow Sprout; the Yellow Sprout is the true earth. True earth is the supreme medicine; the supreme medicine does not depart from the ancestor. Departing from the ancestor, the Elixir cannot form—forming the Elixir is the true principle.\n\nA hen cannot hatch chicks if there is a mother but no father. In vain she broods over single eggs; the qi scatters, and no offspring are born. If you wish to kill quicksilver, you must first kill its mother. When the mother dies and unites with the mysterious primordial, she may then pair with the cinnabar father. Only when father and mother conjoin their true essences is the quicksilver child put to death. Dead quicksilver becomes lead, akin to the Earth of the *Kun* direction. *Kun* earth nurtures the infant boy, transforming into the mother of quicksilver. Quicksilver is but a single substance, never departing from the fire of the South.\n\nIn the *Qian* palace dwells the Vermilion Bird; in the *Kun* palace dwells the Dark Warrior. The Dark Warrior produces *Kun* silver; the Vermilion Bird transforms into yellow earth. Only when they converge in the Central Palace is quicksilver put to death. The Northern Dipper is the pivot of heaven, containing within it the water of the Central Palace. When the Four Symbols gather in the Central Palace, South and North become *Wu* and *Ji*. True essence gives rise to *Qian* and *Kun*; lead and mercury are father and mother. Father and mother are *Geng* and *Xin*, truly endowed with the number of the Southwest. Recognize the essence of *Geng* and *Xin*, and you may then refine the earth of the Central Palace. True earth is produced within it, and only then does it govern the central water.\n\nIf one recognizes true mercury, within yellow gold lies the spirit-fire. If one recognizes true lead, within white gold lies the spirit-water. When the two qi conjoin to form the Elixir, one need not fear the death of quicksilver. If one does not recognize water and fire, how can one understand the principle of *Qian*-mercury? Damp earth cannot dry water; dry earth can restrain water. If one knows the mechanism of generation and destruction, one grasps the principle of the Returned Elixir.\n\nYellow gold is true fire; white gold is true water. How many elixir-refiners have become lost ghosts! *Ji*-earth is not true sulfur; *Wu*-earth is not celestial *Gui*. If one takes these as earth, one does not recognize the subtleties within. Quicksilver must mutually generate; quicksilver must be born and die. To kill quicksilver, one must first kill its mother.\n\nThe essence of prior-heaven *Qian* and *Kun* is the true *Wu* and *Ji*. *Qian* is yellow, *Kun* is white—yellow and white are medicines beyond compare. Use only the essence of yellow and white, not their physical forms. How is the essence of yellow and white obtained? Use only cinnabar as its match. When cinnabar dies and turns red, only then is quicksilver put to death. Quicksilver cannot fly—here lies the formation of the medicine. If immortals obtain this essence, they steal from heaven and earth. If worldly people obtain this essence, they amass gold and become wealthy. From one revolution to nine revolutions, nine times nine is eighty-one. If one understands this principle, one must firmly and secretly secure it. Conceal it without speech, and one ascends to the rank of immortals. If obtained, broadly aid others; if not obtained, do not waste it in vain. If one carelessly reveals this, even the celestial spirits will be displeased. Be cautious, again and again—these are a thousand words, ten thousand phrases.\n\nThe *Golden Valley Scripture*:\nThe *Golden Valley Song* clarifies the method of planting the medicine. The Great Elixir is like a grain of millet, first sown in the Jade Field. Cultivate, harvest, and reap the golden grain to consume it. Its essence lies in working within lead; its use lies in quicksilver alone.\n\nThe Elixir-Refining Formula, the Elixir-Refining Formula—listen carefully as I explain to you:\nThe mother qi first transmits to the child; the first child’s nature is still unrefined. The second child is likewise; in chaos, they are hard to distinguish. The third child begins to shine, transformed and divided into hardness and decisiveness. One child gives birth to another, and the nine children are fierce in nature. Ascending in purity to the Great Void, celestial immortals come to welcome you.\n\nThis Elixir conveys the supreme Dao—do not speak of it to the unworthy.\nElixir, Elixir, Elixir—a single grain grants longevity for ten thousand kalpas.\nOne gives rise to two, two to three, three to the myriad things without end.\nWithout karmic affinity, one cannot encounter this Elixir Scripture—this is the true oral transmission of the sages.\n\nThe crucible has no head; the cauldron has no ears.\n*Geng* is the exterior; *Xin* is the interior.\nThere are no other medicines to take—only water and fire paired together.\nSwallows do not hatch phoenixes; solitary hares do not nurse horses.\nWithout true father and mother, all that is born is false.\nTo plant grain, one must use millet—without millet, no grain will grow.",

Yet in its time, those of shallow understanding and ignorance mistook it for a text on furnace fires and sexual arts. Ye Wenshu, failing to grasp the principle of returning, further appended superficial doctrines of purity to ride its fame. Weng Baoguang, upon reading it, laughed and said, “This is one who knows nothing of the Golden Elixir.” He then composed annotations to correct it. Lu Ziye and Chen Shangyang expanded upon it, and with the emergence of the three commentaries on *Wuzhen*, Ye’s annotations were soon buried.\n\nMaster Zhang Sanfeng of Liaoyang was a celestial immortal. During his time in Wudang, he composed *Twenty-Four Daoist Songs of the Rootless Tree*, a work peerless with Ziyang’s *Wuzhen*, though the world also misconstrued it as concerning sexual arts and furnace fires. Hanxu declared with clarity, “The Dao does not prevail because the Dao is not made clear.” He longed to compose an exegesis to illuminate it but lamented the lack of like-minded alchemical companions.\n\nLiu Wuyuan of Qiyun, with his vast and discerning talent, authored dozens of works transmitted to the world. Among them was *Annotations on the Rootless Tree*. Hanxu obtained and examined it, finding its diction profound and its principles perfectly harmonious. Thereupon, he rejoiced greatly, for it had anticipated what his own heart had long affirmed. Where Liu’s work left some matters unexhausted, Hanxu supplemented them, revealing without omission the inner and outer medicines, the fire phases of returning, and the sequence of furnaces and crucibles.

      "translated_text": "[Li’s Explanation]\nThe mountain recluse has dwelt for years beneath the \"Rootless Tree,\" ever wishing to expound its profound mysteries and summon those of like kind. One day, strolling through the mountain garden, he saw the flowers and trees in their serene seclusion, naturally abundant in grace, and there he grasped that this word \"secluded\" was the wellspring from which the twenty-fourth chapter’s \"Rootless Tree\" unfolds. Secluded—profound, the realm of emptiness and nothingness. All such realms of emptiness in the world are the altars of flowers and trees where Daoists practice. Thus did my mountain teacher inscribe upon the Bamboo-Embracing Study: *\"Three paths of secluded blossoms, fragrance at ease; / Four gardens of cultivated bamboo, shadows intertwined.\"* How wondrous the words! They resonate with this same truth. If flowers are not deeply secluded, their fragrance cannot be at ease; amidst the red dust of the world, peace is elusive day and night.\n\nAs for *\"shadows intertwined\"*—this is the hollow heart and tranquil qi depending upon each other, so that one’s qi nourishes the heart, and the heart nourishes the qi. When qi flourishes, principle is full; when the heart is at peace, the spirit is whole. Thus may one preserve one’s true nature and contain one’s numen. Master Wu Yuan was right to take *\"true numen\"* as the flower and root of the human tree. True numen is true knowing and numinous knowing. Numinous knowing belongs to the nature, which is yin; true knowing belongs to the emotions, which is yang. If nature and emotions remain uncorrupted, the true numen is complete. Yet alas! The seven emotions and six desires consume and deplete it, inwardly damaging the nature and outwardly harming the emotions, so that the true numen vanishes. When the true numen vanishes, there is a tree without flowers, a tree without roots.\n\nMaster Wu Yuan’s meaning is thus. I have more to say: flowers grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, the root grows from nothingness. The essence of the true numen is indeed conceived within emptiness, hence the phrase *\"the flower is truly secluded.\"* That which is conceived within emptiness is the primordial wisdom of the human being, the emptiness and numen within. Without shadow or form, it embodies all principles and responds to all affairs. Sages and worthies employ it with abundance; immortals and buddhas cultivate it to sufficiency. Yet it must not be entangled with emotions and desires. If emotions and desires intrude, one daily extracts being from non-being to meet one’s needs. The more one extracts being, the more one loses non-being; the more one loses non-being, the more one loses the root. Lose the root, and the tree is lost; lose the tree, and the flower is lost. As the saying goes: *\"When a man grows old, his mind wanders east; when a tree grows old, its heart is hollow.\"* Wisdom is exhausted, emptiness and numen scatter—what true numen remains?\n\nAll this comes from craving glory and splendor, refusing to rest, daily pursuing the affairs of floating life, never considering how a hundred years pass in an instant, how death severs all concerns. One sits in the boat of the sea of suffering, yet never thinks that in a single moment of impermanence, the nature may sink with the overturned boat—boundless, shore-less, mooring nowhere, drifting and wandering through the perilous haunts of fish and dragons, endlessly toiling, ceaselessly laboring, only to wound one’s wisdom and fetter one’s emptiness and numen. What benefit is there in this?\n\nThe immortal master, moved by profound compassion, turns the compassionate vessel to ferry them, saying: The reason worldly people sink deeply into the sea of suffering and struggle to escape is that they refuse to turn back and do not recognize the shore. If they would but turn back, that is the shore. The shore is the path of awakening. If one can tread the path of awakening, wisdom returns, emptiness and numen endure. Past errors may yet be corrected; future rightness may still be pursued. Though spirit and qi decline, there is a way to restore them. Only do not wait until the storm’s surging waves shatter the boat. Then, if the boat remains, the person remains—ready for the needs of the other shore, an aid to emerging from the abyss.\n\n[Liu’s Words]\nStrive, diligent seekers.",

Yet to attain such purity, one must first pass through the realm of utter turbidity. Only by remaining unstained amid the deepest filth does true purity arise. Thus it is said: “The rootless tree—its blossoms pure and green; from ancient days to now, flower-wine makes immortals.”\n\nHow can flower and wine give rise to immortals? The brothel’s haze and the meat-and-wine grove are deft at ensnaring mortals. Yet if one can walk through the brothel seeing color as no-color, untempted by its haze; if one can dwell in the meat-and-wine grove, taking each day as it comes, unburdened by its fare—then one neither strays into lust nor shuns flesh’s scent. Appetite and desire are both transformed, the heart of the Dao abides, the human heart fades, and the true spirit remains unharmed, undiminished. The Way may then be hoped for.\n\nThe phrase “no need to shun flesh’s scent” does not mean craving it, but rather that meat and wine pass through the gut while the heart makes no reckoning. Unstained by lust, the heart is free of the brothel’s haze; meat and wine pass through the gut, yet the heart knows no meat or wine. A heart free of the brothel’s haze naturally bears the immortal’s blossom of long life; a heart free of meat and wine naturally holds the immortal’s wine of life’s extension. With immortal blossom and immortal wine, one arrives at the realm of pure truth. Those in the world who shun the brothel’s haze and avoid meat and wine—how could they know that immortals emerge from the midst of mortal blossoms and mortal wine? How could they know that without blossom, without wine, the Dao cannot be achieved?\n\nThe *Knocking on the Hexagrams Song* says:\n“Wine is a good friend, blossoms a companion;\nIn the willow lanes and flower streets, seek the true person.\nThe true person is found only in the flower streets’ play.”\nThis is the subtle use of “blossoms pure and green.”\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nFor most people, the nature of appetite and desire is strongest. Master Immortal Zhang Sanfeng thus used flower and wine as pointers. Many crave flower and wine—yet who knows of the flower-wine immortals? The primordial qi within the body is fresh, verdant, and tender. If one can consume it, harness it, drink it, and wear it, one’s spirit becomes clear and qi invigorated. This is what is meant by “flower-wine immortals,” who have existed from ancient times to the present. Yet these are not the brothel’s haze or the meat-and-wine grove of the world.\n\nThe haze of brothels and the fare of meat and wine dull the spirit. The qi of meat and wine is rank, and the haze of brothels stirs lust—both are harmful, though lust is the graver. Those skilled in refining the self eat when food is at hand, without seeking more. Thus they do not shun flesh’s scent, yet forget it; they see color as no-color, without clinging to beauty. Thus they do not stray into lust, and lust is extinguished. Otherwise, essence scatters and fluids leak, causing no small harm. As the *Yellow Court Classic* says: “Leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdancy; only by sealing and guarding the light can one attain lasting peace.” From this we know that straying into lust must waste the treasure of long life.\n\nMeat and wine pass through the gut—yet the Dao still abides in the heart. How could flower and wine delude one? It is people who delude themselves with flower and wine! Without seeking mortal blossoms or mortal wine, one must find the immortal blossom and immortal wine. Immortal blossom and immortal wine aid the achievement of the Dao—they are the fresh, tender blossoms on the rootless tree, rich in flavor and fine in hue, most potent for nourishment.\n\nThe immortal master opens the primordial gate and tells you this: without such blossoms and wine, the Dao is difficult to achieve.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Words] Refuting heterodox paths.\n[Li’s Words] Lamenting solitary cultivation.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms solitary.\nMay I ask: have you found the matching yin and yang?\nA hen’s egg—hard to hatch a chick,\nFor it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin and yang.\nA woman without a husband is a resentful maiden;\nA man without a wife is a widowed man.\nI sigh for the deluded,\nSo muddled—\nSitting in stillness, cultivating alone, their qi withers.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nThe Way of cultivating truth requires the matching of yin and yang to fully form the treasure of the true spirit. If there is yin without yang, or yang without yin, this is called “solitary blossoms without match,” and the true spirit cannot be formed—just like a hen’s egg. It is hard to hatch a chick because it has turned its back on the alchemical furnace of yin-yang union.\n\nAgain, like a woman without a husband or a man without a wife—how can they bear offspring? Those blind fools in the world, not delving into the principles of yin and yang, not tracing the source of creation, muddled in their affairs: some contemplate emptiness, some regulate breath, some fixate on spirits, some guard the apertures, some move qi—all are sitting in stillness, cultivating alone, yin without yang. Not only do they fail to benefit their nature and life, but they harm them, and the more they cultivate, the more their qi withers.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n“Solitary” refers to inner cultivation. Cultivating nature alone cannot establish life, for it is solitary and without counterpart, unable to give birth to the treasure of life. It is like a hen without a rooster—though it can lay eggs, it cannot hatch chicks. Today, those who cultivate nature to nurture qi do not realize that their qi is merely solitary yin. To avoid withering, true yang must be matched with true yin—only then are they of the same kind.\n\nMay I ask those who cultivate the Dao: have you obtained the matching kind? Here, true yang is righteousness, and true yin is the Dao. Matching righteousness with the Dao, one is no longer solitary. Yet there are three layers to this process: first, true yin gives rise to true yang; next, true yang is matched with true yin; finally, from the union of yin and yang, the vast qi of the true spirit is born. How could this be like a hen’s egg, hard to hatch a chick?",

      "translated_text": "Those that cannot hatch chicks do so because they have abandoned the principle of yin and yang and the furnace of creation. Yin and yang are husband and wife. The Dao of the sage begins with husband and wife, and from them all things are transformed and born—so too is it with the men and women of the world. If a woman has no husband, she is solitary yin that cannot give birth and becomes a resentful maiden; if a man has no wife, he is solitary yang that cannot be nurtured and becomes a widowed bachelor. This principle is clear and easy to understand, yet the deluded of the world remain utterly confused, believing that sitting in stillness alone can clarify the mind, reveal the nature, and allow one to ascend directly—all without ever speaking of the matching of yin and yang. I fear that day after day of sitting and cultivating will only lead one to wander the halls of empty nothingness or play in the sea of extinction, until eventually their qi withers and fades.\n\n*[Liu’s verse:]*\nMatching yin and yang.\n*[Li’s verse:]*\nInverting yin and yang.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms askew—\nseparated from yin and yang, the Dao is incomplete.\nGold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead,\nyang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.\nIn the world, yin and yang—man pairs with woman—\nbear sons and grandsons, generation after generation.\nFollowing the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—\nthe difference lies solely in this inversion.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe *Book of Changes* states: “One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao.” *Awakening to Reality* says: “When yin and yang are of the same kind, they return to mutual resonance; when the two eights are balanced, they naturally unite.” If yin and yang are each askew—if yang stirs but yin does not respond, if yin seeks but yang does not beckon, if yang is excessive while yin is deficient, or if yang is abundant while yin is lacking—then the blossom of true spirit is askew, neither centered nor upright, and the Dao cannot be complete.\n\nA person’s true emotion is like gold, true knowing like lead—both are firm. The numinous nature is like wood, the numinous knowing like mercury—both are soft. True emotion and true knowing, being firm, easily sink; the numinous nature and numinous knowing, being soft, easily float. If nature seeks emotion, emotion returns to nature; if the true restrains the numinous, the numinous returns to the true—then firm and soft respond to each other, yin and yang harmonize, and they transform into one qi, with life’s mechanism enduring unceasingly. But if emotion does not return to nature, if the numinous does not return to the true—this is what is meant by “gold blocks wood, mercury blocks lead, yang widowed, yin solitary, each to one side.” How then can one return to the root and restore the origin, coalescing the elixir of true spirit?\n\nObserve the world: when man and woman unite, they bear sons and grandsons, passing life from generation to generation without end. Know then that the Dao of cultivating the true is the same—when yin and yang unite, they give birth to immortals and sages, also passing on without end. The difference lies only in whether one follows the flow or reverses it, distinguishing immortals from mortals. Following the flow makes one mortal; reversing it makes one immortal—the contention lies solely in this inversion.\n\nThis “inversion” is profound in principle and subtle in practice. It is not the center of inside and outside, nor the center of the body’s upper and lower. It is the center of the union of bright yang, formless and imageless, called the root of heaven and earth, the aperture of yin and yang, the abode of life and death, the gate of primordial transformation. Human life resides here, human death resides here; becoming a sage or worthy resides here, becoming human or beast also resides here. If one cultivating the Dao can stand firm in this place, reverse the flow, and invert it, then calamity transforms into fortune, punishment into virtue—what is called “the elixir forming in a single hour.”\n\nAlas! The “inversion” is not easily known, nor is the person who inverts it. The sexual arts take the place of union between man and woman as the “inversion,” with the man absorbing the woman’s blood as the reversal. The circulation arts take the Yellow Court as the “inversion,” with qi and blood rising in the back and descending in the front as the reversal. All these are but crude imitations—how could they understand the meaning of inversion in the path of immortals? Those who seek the truth should discern this carefully.\n\n*[Li’s explanation:]*\n“Askew” refers to yin and yang being separated, unable to complete the elixir. When yin and yang unite at the center, the knife-point of the elixir congeals, and the arts of the Dao are fully realized. Gold and wood, lead and mercury—these are yin and yang. The essence of wood and the nature of mercury belong to yin; the qi of gold and the emotion of lead belong to yang. Essence and qi require each other, nature and emotion resonate—gold cherishes the benevolence of wood, wood loves the righteousness of gold; mercury goes to welcome lead, lead comes to join mercury. Only then is there no illness of separation, and the great medicine of the true body is born. If yin is solitary and yang widowed, each to one side, then yin and yang do not pair, askew and incomplete—how can they transform and give birth to the supreme treasure, passing it down for ten thousand generations?\n\nThe method of matching is similar for immortals and mortals—only mortals use the flow, while immortals use the reversal. Master Wu Yuan said that the “inversion” is not easily known; I say that even the word “reverse” is not understood. To invert at the center, one must first know the wondrous use of “reverse.” If one knows reversal, then gold, wood, lead, and mercury are all within it; yin and yang, qian and kun, are all inverted—and moreover, all events revolve within the word “reverse.” Obtaining the medicine and returning the elixir can be achieved in an instant.\n\n*[Liu’s verse:]*\nWhen the medicine is born.\n*[Li’s verse:]*\nThe principle of *kun* and *shen*.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms fresh—\nborn in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.\nPluck the blossom, wear it;\ngather the blossom’s heart,\nits pistils layered in spring’s splendor.\nPeople of the world do not grasp the principle within the blossom—\na single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.\nBorrow the blossom’s name, become the blossom’s body—\nevery line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* speaks truly.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\n“Fresh” means that the original thing, long buried, suddenly reappears.

      "translated_text": "This original face is none other than the undying true person within me—with this person, one is human; without it, one is not. It is what I receive from heaven to be human. Yet this true person does not readily appear, nor is it often seen. Only in moments of utter emptiness and profound stillness, when all conditions are stilled, does its image fleetingly emerge. Utter emptiness and profound stillness are the very image of *kun* in its pure yin—hence it is said, “born in the *kun* direction, *kun* is the person.”\n\nThis person has long been buried beneath dust and grime, leaving no trace. When its image suddenly appears, it is like a fresh blossom—an opportunity not to be missed. One must act swiftly, plucking and gathering it to make it one’s own. To “pluck the blossom and wear it” is to take up this true person’s flower; to “gather the blossom’s heart” is to gather this true person’s heart. Gradually plucking and gathering, from little to much, one accumulates depth and radiance, and the true spirit remains undimmed. Then the pistils layer upon layer, all principles become luminous, and wherever the heart turns, the Way is present—its splendor as bright as spring, with yang qi spreading everywhere and blossoms blooming in every place.\n\nYet this flower belongs to everyone; everyone sees it, yet no one grasps it. Most let it slip past them, face to face. If one does grasp it, transcending the mundane and entering sagehood occurs in an instant—hence it is said, “a single secret of heaven’s mechanism is worth ten thousand gold.” The immortal elder, out of compassion, borrows the blossom’s name to become the blossom’s body—now form, now formless—each line of *Knocking on the Trigrams* expounding the intent of the primordial, wishing for all to attain the Dao and each to become an immortal. Alas, how can those of this age not grasp the principle within the blossom, and instead recklessly speculate with “bedchamber arts” and “inner elixirs of the boudoir”? Even the immortal elder can do nothing about it. How lamentable!\n\n*[Li’s commentary:]*\nMaster Wuyuan speaks of the character “person” as the original face—one who has glimpsed this person cannot help but speak at length and with deep feeling, seeking to awaken both self and others with earnest compassion. Yet the word “is” in “kun *is* the person” has not been fully illuminated.\n\nNow, the blossom is likened to the person, and the person borrows the blossom as a metaphor. The blossom being fresh is like a person returning to the root, attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, observing the return of that single yang—unaware, the spring scenery is renewed. This blossom appears in the *kun* direction, meaning *kun* sees the blossom, the blossom sees the person, and where the blossom is born is where the person is born—hence “kun *is* the person.”\n\nIn the alchemical method, lead is sown in the metal village, mercury is scattered in the fire land. Metal and fire reside in the southwest; the southwest gains its companion. Where metal and fire unite is precisely above the *kun* direction. This person is a golden body and fiery form, a realm of pure yang—our true qi, also called true emotion. Vague and indistinct, within it there is an image: hot as fire, radiant as a blossom. Its fragrance intoxicates like wine, and to obtain it is to be as if drunk. At this moment, one must pluck and wear it without delay. One must further gather its heart, swallowing it whole. From blossom to pistil, penetrating layer upon layer, it is truly the splendor of spring’s palace. Yet people know only its exterior and not its interior, and thus cannot grasp the wondrous principle within the blossom.\n\nThe wondrous principle within the blossom is pure heaven’s mechanism. When heaven’s mechanism is revealed, a single secret is worth ten thousand gold. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh lines here are all from Lü Zu’s *Knocking on the Trigrams*. Master Feng said: “Lü Zu borrows the blossom’s name for the human body and takes the blossom’s body as the human’s body.

In every moment, contemplate its images—nothing exists apart from the blossoms in their abundance. At the height of their bloom, when radiance is fully revealed and spirit expends itself outwardly, one is prone to vie for marvels and flaunt refinement. Thus it is said: “Fair and delicate, their beauty rivals powdered jade.” At this very moment, one must guard against peril and danger, firmly tether the ape and horse, don the iron mask of one’s natal face, and wield the treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon. In the presence of phenomena, forget emotion; pluck every blossom that emerges from the wall, allowing not the slightest attachment to form or dissipation of true qi. The “natal face” is the iron mask of unknowing and unawareness. The “treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon” is the true nature untouched by defilement. The natal iron mask and the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword arise from the same source but bear different names: in terms of essence, it is the natal iron mask; in terms of function, it is the Azure Dragon’s treasure-sword. The iron mask is the settled body; the treasure-sword is the instrument of wisdom. Stillness employs wisdom; wisdom perfects stillness. Stillness and wisdom depend on each other; essence and function are never apart. The primordial true spirit is form yet emptiness, ever responsive yet ever still, without leakage or seepage—this is what is meant by “plucking every fresh blossom from the garden wall.” The blossoms on the wall have just emerged but have not yet left the wall, the moment when true qi has not yet dispersed. Pluck them at this instant, and they are utterly free of dross, purely celestial truth. Gradually grow, gradually gather; gradually pluck, gradually withdraw—one must pluck until nothing remains to be plucked. Alas! The great medicine is hard to encounter; the great method is hard to meet. Having chanced upon them, the moment must not be missed.

      "translated_text": "[Li’s Explanation]\n\"Abundance\" refers to the moment of fullness. The beauty of a fair face and delicate features is likened to the primordial unity of qi—just as the Immortal Elder’s *Five Watches Daoist Ballad* says: *\"When all yin is spent, the radiant yang season arrives, / A branch of spring’s splendor, golden blossoms in bloom.\"* \"Surpassing the powdered mass\" describes the birth of the medicine, the very instant when the flower-demon vies in beauty. As the ancient immortals said: *\"When the primordial arises, the demon of medicine readily stirs.\"* If one’s cultivation is not yet pure and unwavering in the face of beauty, who could seize the golden blossom in but half a moment? Thus it is said: *\"Guard against the ape and horse, ever more stubborn\"*—just as the *One Branch of Flowers* ballad puts it: *\"With delicate, alluring grace, / Ten slender fingers, soft and fair, / Yet they stir not my intent-steed or mind-ape.\"*\n\nRaise the iron mask of your birth-given face, bring forth your power of stillness—*\"Let them try, yet not a trace of wavering remains.\"* Draw the true treasure-sword of the Azure Dragon, pluck every fresh blossom from the garden wall—this aligns with *\"Repel the demon horde, fiercely wield the keen-edged sword of wisdom, / Dare to gather those blossoms newly sprung beyond the wall.\"* Wu Yuan takes the iron mask as stillness and the treasure-sword as wisdom, truly a kindred understanding. Yet if stillness and wisdom do not arise from the refinement of the self, then stillness is not true stillness, nor wisdom true wisdom—they cannot be employed when the moment arrives.\n\nThe *One Branch of Flowers* says: *\"Moment by moment, guard the intent-steed, / Instant by instant, lock the mind-ape, / Day and night without rest, / Refine the self with unbroken effort.\"* One must cultivate until *\"I am a sea of purity, unstained by a single speck of dust\"*—only then is it true stillness. *\"I am a night-shining pearl, suspended in the void\"*—only then is it true wisdom.\n\nThe \"garden wall\" signifies the blossom that has emerged beyond the wall yet still clings to it—this is called the \"blossom beyond the wall.\" The fire is at its purest, the timing at its truest; without a transmitted teaching, none can comprehend it, and without having traversed the path, none can know it. If one recognizes the moment the flower’s branch emerges beyond the wall and immediately gathers it, this is the immortal’s art. \"Plucking every blossom\" means drawing it all in with a single breath, swallowing it into one’s own domain—not the gradual gathering and gradual withdrawal. Gradual gathering and withdrawal belong to the later stages of nurturing, drawing out, and replenishing.\n\nSeize the wind-filled sails, return fully laden—when the four signs converge, the elixir is formed, and the River Chariot is swiftly set in motion to carry it back. How could one pass the mountain of treasures in vain? This mountain of treasures is the birthplace of the primordial.\n\nIn the alchemical method, what is refined is called medicine, what is gathered is called medicine, and what is nurtured is called fire. Yet where there is medicine, there is fire—though not the fire of gentle nurturing. This chapter’s annotation correctly interprets the gathering of medicine.\n\n---\n\n[Liu’s Note] Advancing and retreating yin and yang.\n[Li’s Note] Nurturing the returned elixir.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms in flight,\nOnce shed, they bloom again at the appointed time.\nWhen the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent,\nOnce more the western garden’s branches burst with bloom.\nJust gathered beneath the moon’s waning light,\nAgain they mend the robe in morning’s glow.\nThis mystery, rare in the world,\nMust be pondered deeply with the immortals.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nWhen a person’s spirit declines and true numen scatters, it is like blossoms flying and withering away. Yet even fallen blossoms have their season of rebirth; so too does the decline of a person hold the way of return. What is this way of return? It is the path of yin yielding to yang once more, the way of withered blossoms blooming anew.\n\nThe \"lead-flower\" is the radiance of the Dao-heart’s true knowing. *Gui*-water is the selfish desire of the human heart’s guest qi. When the lead-flower appears, the Dao-heart remains undimmed; when *gui*-water is exhausted, the human heart abides in stillness. With the Dao-heart undimmed and the human heart still, the original, unblemished, and perfectly complete true numen reappears—thus the blossoms, though fallen, bloom again in full.\n\nBecause *gui*-water must be spent, it is said: *\"Gathered beneath the moon’s waning light.\"* Because the lead-flower must appear, it is said: *\"Mend the robe in morning’s glow.\"* The selfish desires of the human heart are like the guest qi from without, like the moon’s waning light. The true knowing of the Dao-heart is the original, upright qi, like the sun’s radiance. Gathering beneath the moon’s waning light sweeps away the selfish desires of the human heart—this is the retreat of yin. Mending the robe in morning’s glow gradually replenishes the true knowing of the Dao-heart—this is the advance of yang.\n\nRetreat yin until not a trace of yin qi remains—only then is the waning light fully gathered. Advance yang until yang qi is utterly pure—only then is the robe fully mended. With yin spent and yang complete, one returns to the origin and reverts to the root; the original face is fully revealed. Is not the rebirth of fallen blossoms a true saying? This celestial mechanism of withered blossoms blooming anew is rarely known in the world. To know it, one must ponder its beginning and end alongside the immortals.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nWu Yuan’s annotation is excellent in principle, yet it does not address the core meaning of this chapter. Here, the discussion pertains to the nurturing of the returned elixir. \"Flight\" refers to ascent and descent, signifying the morning advance of yang fire and the evening retreat of yin tally. \"Shedding\" means the elixir has taken form, leaves have fallen to return to the root—this directly points to the restoration of life.\n\nAfter life is restored, one draws upon the external furnace’s metal-water, extracts lead, and replenishes mercury to nurture the spiritual embryo. As *Awakening to Reality* says: *\"The external furnace’s increase and decrease require effort.\"* The *Triple Concordance* states: *\"Observe and tend with utmost care, / Examine and adjust cold and warmth, / Cycle through the twelve nodes, / And when each ends, begin anew.\"* Elder Feng said: *\"At midnight and noon, focus the fire’s timing; / At dawn and dusk, bathe the golden elixir in ice.\"* Thus it is said: *\"Once shed, they bloom again at the appointed time.\"*\n\nThe \"reblooming\" refers to the branches of blossoms in the western garden below. \"When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent\" means the great medicine of the returned elixir arises after *gui*. When lead is born, it is gathered. Gold, when far from its fullness, is unfit for tasting. Only after the initial surge of *gui*-water on the five thousand forty-eighth day does one carefully apply effort, seize the foremost treasure of the first tide—this is the supreme method.",

      "translated_text": "When *gui* arises, it is the fourteenth; when *gui* is spent, it is the fifteenth—at this very moment, a single ray of yang light appears. In the human body, this is nothing other than the great movement within the great stillness. Gather and swallow it, and the returned elixir is formed. Yet once the great elixir is obtained, external lead arises anew, and the alchemist must take it for the purpose of gentle nurturing. Thus it is said: *\"Once more, the western garden’s branches bloom full with flowers.\"*\n\nJust as one faces the moon to gather and put away—this is the drawing of lead—so too does one turn toward the morning sun to mend the patched robe—this is the replenishing of mercury. The method of gathering requires clarity on the moon’s waxing and waning, hence the reference to \"facing the moon\"; the method of mending demands the use of the sun’s dawn and dusk, hence the metaphor of the \"morning sun.\" Such are the subtle truths of the mysterious arts. These profound subtleties are rarely known in the world. Should one wish to understand them, one must seek them through careful inquiry with a realized immortal—only then may one avoid error.\n\n**[Liu’s Verse]**\nThe Moon-Couch Furnace.\n**[Li’s Verse]**\nThe Heavenly Treasure.\n\nThe rootless tree blooms in full,\nPlucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace.\nProlonging life, dispelling calamity,\nBest to forge good bonds and prepare the dharma-wealth.\nFrom this, the Heavenly Treasure may be achieved—\nLet the deluded masses mock my folly.\n\nUrge the worthy to abandon cunning,\nWithout a wise teacher, do not force guesses.\n\n**[Liu’s Annotation]**\nThe treasure of primordial true spirit is formless and imageless, without direction or place—from where, then, is it gathered to congeal the returned elixir? Though formless and imageless, without direction or place, it too has its time of blooming. When that time arrives, within the indistinct there is form; within the profound darkness, there is essence. Its essence is most true, and within it lies constancy. Its symbolic form resembles the Moon-Couch. Common practitioners, unaware of the ancients’ intent in taking this image, misidentify it as the space between the kidneys, or the bright hall between the brows, or the stubborn fleshly heart. Even worse are the demonic fabrications that point to a woman’s birth passage—gross errors, all!\n\nWhat is meant by the \"Moon-Couch\"? It is the moon in its reclining aspect. Each month, on the third day, beneath the dark body of the southwest *kun* earth, the crescent’s light emerges, its glow reclining—hence the name \"Moon-Couch.\" In the hexagrams, this is the faint yang beginning to arise beneath pure yin, the *Fu* hexagram. In the human being, it is the movement after extreme stillness, the birth of brightness in an empty chamber, the stirring of the heart of Heaven and Earth. Within this heart lies a single point of primordial ancestral *qi*, faintly revealing its signs from the depths of darkness, resembling the reclining light of the moon. Because this single point of ancestral *qi* is the root of Heaven and Earth, the origin of the Five Phases, it can create immortals and buddhas, forge sages and worthies, and secure both nature and life—thus it is also called the Moon-Couch Furnace.\n\nThis heart of Heaven and Earth aligns its virtue with Heaven and Earth, its brightness with the sun and moon, its order with the four seasons, and its auspices with spirits and gods—rarely encountered, difficult to meet. Should one chance upon it, the moment must not be missed. One must swiftly reach out to pluck it, seal it securely, and guard against leakage. Thus may life be prolonged and calamities dispelled. Yet such matters of prolonging life and dispelling calamity cannot be undertaken by those without great merit and conduct, nor accomplished by those lacking great resolve and strength. One must externally cultivate good affinities to refine virtue, and internally prepare dharma-wealth with sincerity—only then can one move the Imperial Ultimate and obtain the Heavenly Treasure.\n\nDharma-wealth is not worldly wealth, but the wealth within the dharma: single-minded devotion, true practice, and unwavering resolve—this is the good wealth. As the Perfected One of Upper Yang said: *\"If Heaven resists, one must seek it with dharma-wealth and utmost sincerity. For to seek the Heavenly Treasure, one must exhaust human effort. If human effort is not exhausted, there is no dharma-wealth. Without dharma-wealth, to vainly desire the Heavenly Treasure is difficult indeed.\"* How can one seeking the Heavenly Treasure fail to first prepare dharma-wealth?\n\nThe Heavenly Treasure is no other thing than the golden elixir refined from true spirit, the returned elixir restored to the heart of Heaven and Earth. \"True spirit\" and \"heart of Heaven and Earth\" refer to it before refinement; \"Heavenly Treasure\" and \"golden elixir\" refer to it after refinement and maturation. Once the Heavenly Treasure is obtained, the ten thousand things are all empty, the roots and dust are transformed, and one enters the state of unknowing, without self or others—let the deluded masses mock my folly.\n\nThis folly must be transmitted orally by a wise teacher, heart to heart—it cannot be known through forced guesses. As the Immortal Elder said: *\"Urge the worthy to abandon cunning; without a wise teacher, do not force guesses.\"* How greatly he warns later generations!\n\n**[Li’s Explanation]**\n\"Blooms\" refers to the jade bud’s first arising. The Moon-Couch Furnace has no fixed location in the human body, nor a fixed time, for it appears when yang *qi* first stirs, light within stillness—thus it is compared to the new moon born from extreme darkness. This moon in the sky has its *geng* direction and its third day, both with specific times and places. But in the human body, where it appears is the *geng* direction, and when it appears is the third day—it cannot be predetermined.\n\nWhat is the shape of the Moon-Couch? It is as depicted in Liu’s diagram: reclining, with nine parts black and one part white, the white seen within the black, yang *qi* first arising—thus the white light appears above as the Moon-Couch. What people today describe has this shape, but it is the *upright* moon, not the *reclining* moon.\n\nWhy speak of \"plucking it down\"? Because its *qi* is in the void. When the alchemist sees this thread of white light, one must not rashly activate the river chariot. One should only, with a tranquil spirit and harmonious intent, gather it from where the *qi* arises—hence the phrase *\"plucked from the Moon-Couch Furnace.\"* When spirit and *qi* unite, suddenly the yang light shines fully, like the full circle of the fifteenth day ○—this is the mid-autumn moon, the tide of *qi* at its peak. Only then does one drive it along the Yellow Path and send it to the Yellow Court. From this, life may be prolonged and calamities dispelled.",
      "overlap_context": "he appointed time.\"*\n\nThe \"reblooming\" refers to the branches of blossoms in the western garden below. \"When the lead-flower appears, as *gui* is spent\" means the great medicine of the returned elixir arises after *gui*. When lead is born, it is gathered. Gold, when far from its fullness, is unfit for tasting. Only after the initial surge of *gui*-water on the five thousand forty-eighth day does one carefully apply effort, seize the foremost treasure of the first tide—this is the supreme method.",

      "translated_text": "True companions of the Dharma and wealth are those of like mind who cherish the Dao, willingly offer their good fortune, protect the Dharma for others, and assist in their attainment of the Way. In *Discernments on Cultivating the Real*, Wu Yuan’s commentary on this chapter likewise interprets \"Dharma-wealth\" as something within the body—this is merely a corrective against greed. Speaking impartially, Dharma-wealth has two aspects: the inner Dharma-wealth, which is true gold, and the outer Dharma-wealth, which is a provisional treasure. Though borrowing the provisional to refine the true is indispensable, one should not covet it excessively.\n\nWhen the celestial treasure is refined, one may feign foolishness and play the fool, holding jade within and embracing the uncarved block. Though the deluded masses may mock me as a simpleton, all such matters may be dismissed without concern. Yet how easily can one speak of refining the celestial treasure! Without encountering an enlightened teacher, one cannot know its secrets.\n\n**Liu’s Verse:**\nThe Reverted Elixir ripens.\n\n**Li’s Verse:**\nThe Reverted Elixir enters the mountains.\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms now full,\nBears fruit, its harvest complete in every flavor.\nLike a crimson tangerine, round as a pellet,\nGuard and defend its embankments—never neglect.\nLearn the method of plants gathering their crowns,\nReturn to life, revert to the root, restore the origin.\n\n**Liu’s Annotation:**\nThe treasure of true numen—what departs returns, what is old becomes new again, unharmed and undiminished, still the original substance—this is the fullness of the blossom. \"Fullness\" here speaks of the fruit’s harvest, its flavors complete. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, the Five Phases cluster together, the Four Images harmonize, and benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust merge into one principle. Essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent return to a single *qi*. Further refined by the fire of talismans, it becomes a purely yang substance—lively and fluid, crimson as a tangerine, round as a pellet. At this time, one must guard its embankments, never neglecting vigilance in the twelve hours, concealing one’s brilliance and nurturing obscurity. Learn the method of plants gathering their crowns, return to life, revert to the root, and restore the origin, awaiting the stillness that gives rise to movement. Then, uniting with the primordial, one completes the Great Reversion Elixir. This speaks of the work of forging the Great Elixir after the Reverted Elixir is accomplished.\n\nFor the Reverted Elixir merely restores the original substance of one’s own nature—an affair of transcending the mundane. As Lü Zu said: *\"With three leads, only one lead is secured; the golden fruit and immortal sprout have yet to take form.\"* The Great Elixir, however, is the upward endeavor pursued after the Reverted Elixir—a matter of entering sagehood. As Lü Zu said: *\"Reinstall the furnace, reset the crucible, ride the tiger and mount the dragon to leave the mortal realm.\"* If one only refines the Reverted Elixir without forging the Great Elixir, one merely completes the initial vehicle of the Dao, becoming nothing more than a whole person—how could one enter the realm of the sages?\n\nThe \"selecting of a numinous site\" and \"establishing of a Dao hermitage\" do not refer to external places but to the numinous site and Dao hermitage within. When cultivation reaches the point of reverting to the root and restoring life, the work of the Reverted Elixir is complete. Nurturing and warming it, when spirit and *qi* are abundant, the elixir becomes numinous—this is called the Numinous Elixir. From this numinous site, reinstall the furnace and reset the crucible—this is called establishing the Dao hermitage. \"Selecting a numinous site\" means awaiting the arising of the first yang. This first yang is the yang of primordial stillness giving rise to movement, unlike the yang of the Reverted Elixir, which arises from the postnatal to become primordial. Though both are primordial, there is a distinction of before and after. To complete the Great Reversion Elixir, one must unite with the yang within the primordial—without this, success is impossible. Thus it is said: *\"Uniting with the primordial completes the Great Reversion.\"*\n\nOnly when the Great Elixir is accomplished does one lay the foundation of sagehood. If the Great Elixir remains unformed, it is but a halfway endeavor, not the full achievement of cultivation. As the Buddhist scriptures say: *\"One who halts at the hundred-foot pole has entered but not truly arrived. Advance another step at the hundred-foot pole, and the ten directions become one’s entire body.\"* Does this not speak of completing the Great Reversion?\n\n**Li’s Explanation:**\n\"Full\" refers to the Reverted Elixir, signifying the reunion of nature and emotions. Its method lies in attaining emptiness and guarding stillness. Observe the moon’s waxing in the west—it is like the initial stirring of yang *qi*. Immediately mobilize one’s own mercury to meet it, where external contact sparks internal resonance, and internal touch evokes external response, like a magnet drawing iron. Gather it into the cinnabar field—this is the external elixir. The method is exceedingly simple and easy, so the ancient immortals said: *\"It can be accomplished in less than half an hour.\"*\n\nThe Elixir has two grades, which may be divided into three vehicles. The methods of the three vehicles all involve gathering the lead blossom and are all called Reverted Elixirs, differing only in their scale and sequence.\n\nThe first is the initial vehicle, called the Coagulated Elixir or Jade Fluid Reverted Elixir. Within the postnatal, it returns to the primordial, departing from *gui* to take *ren*, nurturing it with jade fluid to round the inner elixir—this is the study of fulfilling one’s nature, the immortal of humanity.\n\nThe second is the superior vehicle, named the Reverted Elixir or Sevenfold Return. Using the primordial returned from the postnatal, it plants the seed of the primordial, establishing the Elixir Mother—this is the study of establishing one’s life, the immortal of earth.\n\nThe third is the great vehicle, called the Ninefold Cyclical Great Reversion Elixir. Its medicine is likened to the full moon of the fifteenth night. Within the primordial, it is primordial; when the fire arrives, it moves, transforming into white fluid. Swallowed into the abdomen, it congeals into something supremely firm—this is the Golden Fluid Reverted Elixir, most numinous and wondrous, perfecting sagehood and realizing transcendence. This is the study of uniting nature and life, the immortal of heaven.\n\n\"The blossoms now full\" refers to the foundation of the superior vehicle’s elixir. Having formed one fruit and reaped one harvest, its method of refining lead involves the mutual absorption of two substances, with the Five Phases all complete—this is what is meant by \"flavors complete.\" Though this elixir is not that of the great vehicle, it is nonetheless vividly crimson like a tangerine and perfectly round like a pellet. At this stage, one must silently attend to it, continuously preserving it as if it were always present. Otherwise, if one’s embrace is not intimate, it may easily slip away. Thus, one must guard its embankments and never neglect vigilance.",

Wu Yuan states that the numinous site and Daoist hermitage reside within the human body, yet they also serve dual functions, inner and outer. For the inner numinous site and hermitage, one must seek clarity and stillness in the spirit terrace, with harmonious qi and spirit, and therein establish the Peaceful Hermitage of the Daoist’s heart. For the outer numinous site and hermitage, one must seek blessed mountains and auspicious lands, free from the disturbance of worldly dust, and therein establish the Thatched Hut of White Clouds for the Daoist. In this way, both the heart and its traces remain pure, true power fills to the brim, yang is born within lead, and through gathering and uniting, the Dao is accomplished in the ninefold great return—thus the sagely work is perfected.\n\n**Liu’s Note:** The qi of true oneness.\n**Li’s Note:** The place of union.\n\nThe rootless tree—its blossoms now flourishing—speaks of the rootless as though it had roots. The three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five: when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins. How clear this is, yet when explained to you, I fear you may meet it and still fail to recognize it truly.\n\n**Liu’s Commentary:** The treasure of the primordial true numinous, possessing all principles and responding to all affairs, still and unmoving, yet when stimulated, penetrating all—nowhere obstructed, nowhere not efficacious—this is the flourishing of the blossoms. Since the blossoms flourish, though the tree is rootless, the blossoms nonetheless have roots. What root is this? It is the aperture of the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—and the essence of the wondrous union of yin-yang and the Five Phases. Because it is the aperture of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, it is born prior to heaven and earth yet concealed within them afterward. One qi divides into yin and yang, and yin and yang unite to form one qi. Thus, when heaven and earth’s yin and yang above and below unite, they merge into one qi and the myriad things are born; when the sun and moon’s yin and yang come and go in union, they merge into one qi and cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman’s yin and yang unite with one another, conception begins. Observing heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman—only when one yin and one yang unite is there creation. From this, one may know that the Dao of nature and life cannot be completed without the union of yin and yang into one. This one qi is the root of nature and life, the aperture of life and death. With this aperture, yin and yang unite and life is born; without this qi, yin and yang turn away from one another and death ensues. Human life and death lie solely in the presence or absence of this one qi. Yet people do not know what this qi is or where it resides. Some mistake it for the qi of breath, or circulate it upward and downward in the Yellow Court, or gather it in the cinnabar field, or concentrate it between the brows, or collect it in the Celestial Valley, or amass it behind the brain—endless strange and fantastical notions, all ultimately leading to emptiness and loss. They do not realize that the primordial true oneness qi is invisible, inaudible, and intangible. The sage shapes the real through the empty, manifests the existent through the nonexistent. The real and existent are true yin and true yang; the empty and nonexistent are the qi of the two eights’ waxing and waning. When these two are juxtaposed, one qi resides in the center, congealing into the elixir—this is an endeavor of the empty void. How could it be guessed at through forms and images? How could it be sought in apertures with fixed locations? Since the Immortal Elder saw that people did not recognize this one qi, he pointed to the apertures of the three talents and the essence of the two and five, and further illustrated it through the union of heaven and earth, sun and moon, man and woman, clearly indicating this one qi to all. Yet he feared that when people encountered this one qi, they might fail to recognize it even when face to face. With boldness and at risk of censure, I, Wu Yuan, shall now vividly convey the Immortal Elder’s meaning for all to hear. Know that the primordial true oneness qi is no other thing—it is the qi of a single point of true numinosity. Because this qi is firm, strong, centered, and upright, it is called true oneness; because it is easy to know and simple in its efficacy, it is called true numinosity. True oneness and true numinosity are utterly without impurity, hence they are called primordial things. True oneness and true numinosity emerge from the same source under different names—they are not two separate things. Does anyone truly recognize this?\n\n**Li’s Explanation:** \"Flourishing\" means unobstructed. The unobstructed qi emerges from the \"union\" in the following text. Blossoms grow from the tree, the tree grows from the root, and the root grows from nothingness—thus the rootless has roots. The rootless root is the root that generates heaven, earth, and humanity. This root is a single aperture of emptiness and nothingness, hence it is called the aperture of the three talents. This aperture is the place of essence-union, thus it is said: \"the three talents’ apertures, the essence of the two and five.\" The two and five: heaven’s five is one five, earth’s ten is another five—thus the two and five are two earths, and when the two earths unite, the knife-point elixir is formed. The *Mud Pill* states: \"The Mysterious Pass, an aperture no one knows—this is the knife-point elixir, most wondrous and rare.\" For the place where the two and five unite in essence is the wellspring of elixir production. The great cultivator, recognizing this empty aperture as the place of union, must be able to draw the primordial one qi from the emptiness and nothingness—how great is its function! Thus, when heaven and earth unite, the myriad things are born; when sun and moon unite, cold and heat follow in order; when man and woman unite, conception begins—all evidence of this union. Though this principle is perfectly clear and easily understood by all, in truth, no one understands it. The Immortal Master, in his vast compassion, explains it to you: you need only unite the two qi into one mass where the two eights meet, and the great medicine will be born.",

Thus, one must guard its embankments and never neglect vigilance.",

At the time of their finest bloom, when the moon’s radiance unfolds, the golden essence flourishes in abundance, and one should admire it, lest it be lost before one’s eyes. These blossoms open month by month, appearing in season and not out of season, following the lunar cycle with unchanging regularity, their movement and stillness constant, not deviating by even a hair’s breadth.\n\nThe golden essence is the luminous essence of metal; in the moon, it is called the moon’s radiance; in man, it is called true essence. True essence is the essence of true numinosity, never dimmed or obscured, and thus it is likened to the moon’s radiance and the golden essence. The true numinosity of man is not easily known, yet it may be understood by observing the truth of the moon and metal; the true numinosity of man is not easily seen, yet it may be perceived in the moon’s radiance and the brilliance of metal.\n\nThe essence of all things decays with time, yet the moon’s radiance unfolds month after month, and the golden essence remains undiminished for ten thousand years. Just as the moon’s radiance and the golden essence endure, so too does man’s true essence—though at times it may seem obscured, this is only because postnatal yin qi veils it, while its original substance has never been extinguished.\n\nWhen the golden essence waxes strong, it is the true essence waxing strong. When the true essence is at its peak, it illumines the world, its qi filling the cosmos—white snow flies across the sky, yellow sprouts cover the earth, golden light dazzles the eye, and wherever one turns, there are blossoms. Yet this true essence is formless and imageless, neither substance nor emptiness; it cannot be sought with intention, nor preserved with non-intention. It can only be grasped spiritually, not spoken of in words. Though it is bright and clear, fully manifest, seen by all, it is recognized by none. It is most difficult to recognize truly, and the cultivator must delve deeply into its subtleties, attaining true knowledge and penetrating insight, before daring to act—lest one mistake the false for the true, the seemingly correct for the genuinely so, and pluck the wrong melon in the garden.\n\nThose blind practitioners of the world, who stumble in their refinement, may suspect the golden essence to be something with form and image, and thus refine the five metals and eight minerals, ingesting the myriad herbs and thousand formulas—things of a different kind from ourselves. How could they ever congeal the elixir and extend their lives? Is this not a grave error?\n\nThe toad is a creature of water, belonging to yin; yet when called *golden*, it is the yang within yin, the white within black—this is our true knowing. The crow is a creature that flies above, belonging to yang; yet when called *jade*, it is the yin within yang, the feminine within the masculine—this is our numinous knowing. Only true knowing and numinous knowing are of the same kind as ourselves, the treasures of our nature and life. Taking these two and uniting them to form the elixir, true yet utterly numinous, numinous yet utterly true—true and numinous undispersed, wholly embodying the principle of heaven—neither substance nor emptiness, neither arising nor ceasing: this is what is meant by the moon’s radiance, this is what is meant by the golden essence.

      "translated_text": "[Li’s Explanation]\n\"Excellent\" signifies beauty, the designation for the golden flower. Alchemists call true lead the \"golden flower.\" As the *Cantong Qi* states: \"The lead’s body is black without, yet harbors a golden flower within.\" From this black lead, one extracts white gold and pairs it with cinnabar mercury, thereby producing the primordial qi. This is precisely the \"golden flower.\" Returning it to oneself yields the reverted elixir, yet the reverted elixir must first be preceded by refining the self. When the self is purely refined, the reverted elixir comes easily.\n\nOne who \"forgets emotion in the face of scenery\" has achieved mastery in refining the self. All beautiful scenes stir no emotion; one’s sole desire is to cherish this single point of qi—this true qi, called the moon’s radiance. Why is it also named the moon’s radiance? Because the moon’s fullness serves as a gauge for the qi’s condition. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: \"On the fifteenth of the eighth month, one delights in the toad’s glow—precisely when the golden essence waxes strong.\" This is identical in method to delighting in the moon’s radiance.\n\nThe moon begins to wax on the third day; Lu Yan likens this to tender qi. By the fifteenth, it is full; Lu Yan likens this to qi at its fullest. When qi is full, the golden essence waxes strong. The golden essence is the substance that appears within the moon’s radiance—same origin, different names. When it waxes, yellow sprouts fill the crucible, and white snow suffuses the sky. To the enlightened eye, it shines resplendent as a flower. The alchemist, wielding the sword that pierces heaven, gathers it, then applies fire at the proper time to refine the reverted elixir. This flower alone is the true prize.\n\nOne must never discard the true flower to pluck false gourds in the garden, lest one come to lament the error. Not only are gourds mistaken, but the five metals and eight stones are likewise false and not true. The myriad herbs and thousand formulas are all deviations, not the Way. What one seeks—neither false nor deviant—is this golden essence alone.\n\nFrom whence does this golden essence arise? Observe the golden toad and the jade crow: these are its birthplaces. The toad, a yin creature of the water, is called \"golden\"—thus the true yang within Kan. The crow, a yang creature of the sky, is called \"jade\"—thus the true yin within Li. When true yin and true yang interact, they generate the qi of the two crescents. From the qi of the two crescents arises the true One qi. The moon’s radiance and the golden essence are both this same thing; one need only recognize it truly. If one recognizes it truly, one is a seasoned master, clear in fire times and discerning of lead.\n\n[Liu’s Explanation]\nGathering the medicinal ingredients.",

      "translated_text": "[Li’s Explanation]\nThis fragrance is neither perceptible nor foul—an utterly pure and pristine fragrance, the fragrance of primordial arising, unstained by the postnatal realm.\n\nThe lead crucible is the external crucible. The method for refining lead requires establishing an external crucible in the southwest, called the \"Village of Kun\" or \"Mother Kun.\" The mother’s body is inherently empty and must rely on the father Qian’s solar essence to produce lead. This solar essence is the dragon’s mercury. The dragon, as the eldest son, takes the father’s place and enters the mother’s womb, where qi and essence intermingle, and the crucible of primordial true lead is thus established. Ancestor Zhong said: *\"The great yang shifts into the moon’s brightness\"*—this is the method of establishing the crucible. The following line, *\"Within the moon, the sun is clearly seen,\"* refers to this state of gentle warmth. When the lead crucible is gently warm, the treasure-light appears. This treasure-light is the light of the life-treasure; when it emerges, it is the primordial qi, a white image reflected above the brows and eyes. Ancestor Lü said: *\"The lead crucible gently warm, light pierces the curtain,\"* and again: *\"Examine the space between the brows—there lies the sign.\"* This describes the same vision.\n\nThe golden bridge is the magpie bridge below, located on the path to the southwest, where the golden qi shines. The winding river is where qi encircles the magpie bridge, its light imprinting the southwest. Some of old interpreted Ancestor Lü’s line *\"On the winding river, the moon’s radiance gleams pure\"* as referring to the twelve curves of the small intestine—this is a descent into demonic delusion. Others have taken it to mean the space between the mouth and nose, an even graver fall into delusion. Only Master Chen Niewan said: *\"On the southwest path, the moon’s radiance shines bright; the great medicine is born from this place.

Pill.\nEarly on, the nine apertures of the body are all opened.\n\n[Liu’s Commentary]\nThe treasure of true love, once worldly dust is shed,\nBecomes utterly pure and clear—how could its flowers not bloom fresh?\nYet their freshness depends entirely on the work of talismanic fire searing lead and mercury.\nTrue numinosity is the essence of true knowing and numinous knowing;\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing are the functions of true numinosity.\nTrue numinosity divides into true knowing and numinous knowing;\nTrue knowing and numinous knowing unite to form true numinosity.\nTo refine the lead of true knowing and the mercury of numinous knowing\nIs to refine true numinosity itself.\nRefining means using true knowing to govern numinous knowing,\nAnd numinous knowing to align with true knowing.\nWhen true knowing and numinous knowing congeal,\nThey restore the treasure of true numinosity—\nThe freshness of its flowers defies description.\n\nYet while true numinosity is easily formed, the firing times are most difficult.\nAs Master Ziyang said:\n*“Though you recognize cinnabar and black lead,\nWithout knowing the firing times, it is all in vain.\nThe work depends entirely on the power of cultivation—\nA hair’s breadth off, and the elixir will not form.”*\n\nThe Dao of the golden elixir requires gathering the medicine at the proper time\nAnd refining it with the proper method.\nWithout knowing the time or the method,\nEven if the great medicine is in sight, it will not be yours.\nThus, at the moment of tending the furnace,\nAmidst the indistinct, forms appear;\nWithin the profound darkness, essence arises.\nA single spark of true numinosity’s light\nEmerges from the formless—\nSeeming to exist, yet not existing;\nNeither form nor emptiness.\nVisions manifest—this is the moment the great medicine is born.\n\nAt this time, the Three Corpses, Six Thieves,\nThe Five Aggregates, and the Seven Emotions—\nAll manner of illusory visions—\nMay also appear before you.\nYou must steady the Dharma-boat,\nFirmly grasp the helm,\nForget the visions, and remain unmoved,\nLetting the waves churn the sea’s depths without wavering.\nThrough such effort, gradually gathering and refining,\nNurturing yang and restraining yin,\nThe longer you persist, the stronger the work becomes.\nWhen the work is complete,\nEssence transforms into qi,\nQi transforms into spirit,\nSpirit transforms into emptiness.\nCrossing these Three Passes,\nThe wind stirs in the Mud Pill,\nThe Dharma-body manifests—\nAnd the yin qi of the body’s nine apertures is all transmuted.\n\nThe Three Passes are not the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* of the alchemical tradition,\nBut the three passes of refining essence, qi, and spirit:\nRefining essence into qi is the first pass,\nRefining qi into spirit is the middle pass,\nRefining spirit into emptiness is the upper pass.\nCrossing these Three Passes, spirit merges with the Great Void,\nMoving freely without obstruction—\nThis is called piercing the Mud Pill,\nFor the Mud Pill Palace is where spirit is stored.\nThe nine apertures belong to the illusory body,\nBut once the Three Passes are crossed and the Mud Pill is pierced,\nThe Dharma-body is perfected.\nThe yin qi of the illusory body’s hundred channels and nine apertures\nIs transformed into yang qi,\nAnd every aperture shines with light—\nEven the million and four thousand hairs\nBecome guardian spirits.\nStudents must not let words obscure the meaning.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nThis chapter speaks of *wenyang*—nurturing and refining.\nWu Yuan’s interpretation—that crossing the Three Passes, piercing the Mud Pill, and opening the nine apertures refers not to the lower, middle, and upper *dantian* but to the three refinements after which spirit merges with the Void, moving freely, and the illusory body’s nine apertures all shine with light—is correct.\nHowever, the preceding lines must be understood in the context of *wenyang*.\nOtherwise, the stages of entering the chamber to return the elixir,\nNurturing the embryo, and shedding the husk\nWould all be jumbled together,\nWhich does not align with the immortal masters’ intent of explaining each stage in turn.\nThus, this passage refers solely to *wenyang*.\n\n“Fresh” means radiant—\nThe sign of deep *wenyang* work,\nRenewing day by day, flourishing month by month.\n“Talismanic fire” refers to the cyclical firing times:\nAt dawn, advancing the yang fire;\nAt dusk, retreating the yin talisman.\nThe *zi* hour is when yang is born, and fire should be advanced at *zi*,\nBut by dawn, it is the *yin* hour—\nWhy advance fire at *yin* instead of *zi*?\nBecause fire is born in *yin*, where yang qi flourishes,\nSo fire is advanced at this time.\nThe *wu* hour is when yin is born, and the talisman should be retreated at *wu*,\nBut by dusk, it is the *xu* hour—\nWhy retreat the talisman at *xu* instead of *wu*?\nBecause fire is stored in *xu*, where yin qi is concealed,\nSo the talisman is retreated at this time.\nRetreating the talisman replenishes mercury;\nAdvancing fire draws out lead.\nLead governs mercury,\nMercury embraces lead—\nLead diminishes day by day, while mercury increases,\nHence the line: *“Talismanic fire sears mercury and lead.”*\n\n“Tending the furnace” refers to the external furnace,\nNot the furnace used when entering the chamber.\nWhen entering the chamber to refine lead, a crucible is necessary,\nBut in *wenyang*, only the furnace is used, not the crucible.\nYet the furnace may be external or internal.\nAs Ziyang said:\n*“Within, there is the natural true fire,\nIn the furnace, ever blazing bright red.”*\nThis is the internal furnace.\nHe also said:\n*“For the external furnace, diligence in increasing and decreasing is key—\nNothing surpasses the true seed.”*\nThis is the external furnace.\n\nAt the furnace’s edge, wondrous visions appear—\nNot the radiance of the treasure,\nNor illusory visions,\nBut the civil fire within and the martial fire without.\nCivil and martial fires refine,\nGradually gathering, gradually adding.\nThe work of *wenyang* must not be interrupted.\nIt depends entirely on the Dharma-boat and the master’s hand,\nUnshaken by wind or waves,\nUndisturbed in its primal work.\nThen the Dharma-boat sails boundlessly,\nComing and going without cease—\nLike Bodhidharma carrying gold across the sea,\nDirectly reaching the other shore.\nHence the lines:\n*“Gathering all depends on the Dharma-boat,\nThe master’s hand, firm at the helm,\nLetting the great waves churn the sea’s depths.”*\n\nThe final three lines are already clarified in Liu’s commentary;\nNo further explanation is needed.",

      "translated_text": "Sixteen\n[Liu’s Note] Recognize true lead.\n[Li’s Note] The singular true lead.\n\nThe rootless tree, its blossoms in full bloom—\nRecognize true lead as the primal ancestor.\nEssence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines,\nWoman transforms to man, the old to youth.\n\nTo seize the White Tiger in the west,\nFirst tame the Green Dragon in the east.\nLike attracts like—strive well:\nWhen the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\n“In full bloom” speaks of luxuriance and abundance. Amidst the flourishing blossoms, good and bad, partial and true, mingle together. Only the true immortal blossom may be gathered and used. What is this true immortal blossom? It is true lead. This lead is the true emotion of true knowing, the manifestation of true numen. As true knowing is outwardly yin and inwardly yang—outwardly black, inwardly white—it is called true lead, or “gold within water,” or “lead of the watery realm,” or “flower within the moon.” Its names are manifold, yet all denote this single thing: true knowing. Only this true knowing contains the primordial true unity’s initial qi, the root of yin and yang, the source of the Five Phases, the seed of immortals and buddhas, the lineage of sages and worthies—the true primal ancestor of all who cultivate the Dao.\n\nOnce the ancestor is recognized and brought home, revered and upheld without a moment’s separation, essence, qi, and spirit naturally gather in the crucible, without need for force. For when the father returns, where would the child go? With the added work of talismanic fire and refinement, even a woman may transform into a man, even the old may become youthful. “Woman transforms to man” does not mean the body changes form; rather, a woman, being purely yin, through cultivation and refinement, transmutes yin into yang, becoming like a man. “The old become youthful” does not mean the face regains youth; rather, the old, their qi withered, through cultivation and refinement, return to the root and revert to the origin, becoming like a child.\n\nYet the way of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful, though it begins with recognizing true lead and true knowing, also requires first mastering the refinement of the self. If the refinement of the self is not thorough, true knowing will not come; even if it comes, it will not stay. Thus it is said: *“To lead the White Tiger from the western garden, first subdue the Green Dragon in the eastern home.”* The White Tiger belongs to the west and metal, symbolizing true emotion; the Green Dragon belongs to the east and wood, symbolizing true nature. True emotion and true nature are originally one family—why the need to lead or subdue? Because after their entanglement in the postnatal, the true is mixed with the false: true emotion becomes false emotion, kindness tinged with harm. Like a tiger leaving its den, it rushes west to wound others, no longer belonging to me but dwelling in another’s home.\n\nOnce true emotion becomes false, true nature is obscured and likewise turns false. The false takes charge, the true retreats, and nature and emotion fall out of harmony—like the dragon in the east and the tiger in the west, never meeting. To restore the true, one must first dispel the false; to lead emotion, one must first harmonize nature. Harmonizing nature is the work of refining the self. Refining the self means refining the nature of one’s temperament. When the nature of temperament is transformed, true nature naturally appears. With true nature manifest, unshaken and unmoved, true emotion also emerges. When true emotion emerges, false emotion does not arise, and the White Tiger may be led back to pair with the Green Dragon, emotion and nature entwined in love.\n\nThe White Tiger is the primal ancestor of true lead, differing only in name. Because true knowing is unyielding and strong, it is called the White Tiger; because true knowing is soft yet conceals strength within, it is called true lead. To lead the White Tiger is to gather true lead. “Leading” here is not by force but a leading without leading—when nature is settled, emotion naturally returns. This is simply the way of like attracting like, the resonance of yin and yang within and without. Nature presides within and belongs to yin—the inner medicine; emotion operates without and belongs to yang—the outer medicine. Yin and yang are originally one qi, nature and emotion share the same root. When the inner medicine flows, the outer medicine cannot but flow. Inner and outer in harmony, nature seeks emotion and emotion longs for nature. When nature and emotion unite, true numen congeals, and the symbol of the returned elixir appears.\n\nThe Pure Yang Elder said: *“When nature abides, qi naturally returns; when qi returns, the elixir naturally forms.”* The Purple Yang Elder said: *“To refine the ninefold transmutation, first refine the self and hold fast to the heart.”* Both speak of the necessity of refining the self before the elixir may return.\n\nAlas! True lead is easy to gather, but refining the self is most difficult—the work of refining the self is truly great!\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\n“In full bloom” speaks of the intensity of emotion. Lead is the true lead within a person. When true lead manifests, its emotion is most intense. Simply recognize the true and gather it, and the golden elixir is immediately accomplished. For this true lead is the embodiment of the central yellow and upright position, the primal ancestor of the great elixir. Gather it to restrain mercury, and the three families meet to form the immortal infant. Extending this, thousands upon thousands, generations of descendants all trace their lineage to this true lead. Thus it is called the primal ancestor.\n\n“Essence, qi, spirit—one crucible refines” describes the state after lead returns and mercury is subdued, the three families meeting. Yet to forge true lead, there is first the wondrous art of woman transforming to man and the old becoming youthful. The fire of the Li Palace is true essence; the water of the Kan Palace is true qi; between Kan and Li, there is the wondrous earth at work—true spirit, also called true intent. When qi and essence interact, with spirit presiding, gold is born in the water, mercury descends in the fire. With spirit maintaining balance, regulating excess and deficiency, through fierce refinement, the fire steams and the water boils, and gold rises with the water—this is the power of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.\n\nWhen it enters the Li Palace, the fire of Li is extinguished by the water of Kan. It does not fly or flee. Qi is stabilized by spirit, essence is congealed by spirit. Lead and mercury both die, returning together to the fertile earth. The three families meet in the central palace, refined into a single purple golden elixir—this is the wondrous work of essence, qi, and spirit refined in one crucible.",

      "translated_text": "When first the Eastern House’s son entrusted his form to the West, the Western Dui became the true Maiden, the Maiden acting in place of Mother Kun. Within the female crucible appeared the Thunder Male—thus the female transformed into male. This male is called the Third Lord of the Nine, young in years, truly the Dao Father of Wood Duke incarnate in the womb of the child. Hence Wood Duke is renamed the Duke’s Son, the old transformed into the youthful.\n\nThis Duke’s Son rides a white tiger, roaming the Western lands with fierce might. Once a Daoist saw and asked him, “You, the tiger-riding youth—are you the transformation of Wood Duke?” The youth, knowing the man’s heart held true awakening, dared not conceal the truth and answered, “Yes.” The Daoist then turned and laughed, saying, “The lead of the watery realm is but one flavor. Master Cui’s words are true indeed.”\n\nNow, to summon back the Duke’s Son, one must first capture his white tiger, for the white tiger is the steed formed from the youth’s primordial qi. If you wish to journey west to seize the white tiger, you must first subdue the green dragon in the Eastern House. For the white tiger is the nature of metal; the green dragon is the nature of wood. When wood interacts with metal, fire arises within wood, and fire in turn compels metal to return. When metal merges with wood, water surges within metal, and water in turn extinguishes fire to stabilize it. These four, though distinct, are in truth the same—different in kind yet alike in essence.\n\nSince they are of the same kind, employ your mysterious skill to bring them together. Thus, inner and outer unite, outer returns to inner submission, and when the outer medicine connects with the inner, the inner medicine likewise connects with the outer. This passage speaks only of true lead, not of true mercury, for where there is lead, there is mercury—though mercury is unspoken, it resides within. Hence it is said, “When the outer medicine flows, the inner medicine flows.”\n\nLead, qi, male, youth, tiger—all are outer medicine. Essence, female, elder, dragon—all are inner medicine.

      "translated_text": "[Liu’s Annotation] The true spirit lies concealed within the postnatal, obscured by accumulated habits and guest qi. Its blossom is most difficult to unfold. Occasionally, when it does emerge, a single gleam of radiance pierces through the void—like a pearl, like dew—tender, delicate, and exquisitely fair. Its appearance is most fragile, as if opening yet not fully open. The primal qi, undifferentiated and whole, in heaven responds to the stars’ brightness (though not yet full), and on earth to the soil’s moisture (though not yet damp). The brightness of stars and the dampness of earth are both signs of yang qi’s initial stirring.\n\nWhen yang qi first stirs, it is the tender moment of the true spirit’s blossom. At this very instant of fragility, the conscious mind may seize upon the spirit’s light to spawn delusion, scattering nature and shifting emotion. One must swiftly apply fierce firing and rapid refinement, nip deviations in the bud, and guard against subtle errors—nurturing yang while suppressing yin—to protect the treasure of life.\n\nThe dragon-slaying sword serves to curb the temper of qi; the tiger-binding cord serves to restrain delusive emotions. When the temper of qi does not flare, the true spirit manifests; when delusive emotions do not arise, true feeling is born. With true nature revealed and true feeling born, one revolves the Northern Asterism’s pivot and turns the Big Dipper’s handle, transforming killing into life and converting punishment into virtue. Thus can one forge and refine a crucible of true sun and moon.\n\nThe sun is the image of yang containing yin, an analogy for the numinous awareness inherent in true nature. This awareness is the female within the male, true yin. The moon is the image of yin containing yang, an analogy for the true knowing inherent in true feeling. This knowing is the white within the black, true yang. Forging and refining true yin and true yang—these two great medicines—returns them to a single qi, which congeals into the elixir. Swallowed and ingested, it extends life and reverses destiny.\n\nThis is the most sublime and wondrous Dao, not one of the three thousand six hundred heterodox paths that cling to emptiness or fixate on forms. For when the great Dao is accomplished, one ascends cloud-laden skies and roams freely at will, and all sins, filth, and mundane dust are erased with a single stroke. Those three thousand six hundred heterodox paths, however, merely tinker with the stinking skin-bag, only inviting more sins, filth, and mundane dust—how could they ever erase them?\n\n[Li’s Exegesis] “Fair” describes the tender delicacy of the moment when the first yang sprouts. Heaven corresponds to the upper, earth to the lower. At the time of yang’s birth, a flicker of starlight appears above the brows (the ancients called this “heaven responding to the stars”), and a vast tidal qi surges within the abdomen (the ancients called this “earth responding to the tide”). Such are the signs of the medicine’s arising—this is no falsehood.\n\nMaster Wuyuan likened the stars’ brilliance in heaven and the dampness of earth to the initial stirring of yang qi, neither full nor moist, which is also a valid interpretation. Others cite *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, where “heaven responding to the stars” refers to the upper magpie bridge, and “earth responding to the tide” to the lower magpie bridge—both hold profound principles. Yet I have privately heard that “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide” pertain to aligning with the moon and the hour: the stars awaken one to the moon, the tide to the time. This is precisely the crucial firing timing of the great returning elixir.\n\nI excerpt a few lines from the *Cantong Qi* as corroboration:\n*“The metal reckoning is fifteen,\nThe water number is the same.”*",

      "translated_text": "Before the furnace, fix the weight in two *zhu*,\nFive parts water remain in excess.\nWhen these two are taken as true,\nThe gold’s weight returns to its origin.\nIf the third enters, it will not do—\nTwo parts fire must accompany it.”\n\nThis is the true meaning of “responding to stars” and “responding to the tide.” The gold must weigh fifteen *liang* precisely because it aligns with the moon’s number, signifying the full vigor of metal’s essence. Over 5,048 days, the celestial *qi* first reaches completion, and fifteen *liang* of gold can generate fifteen parts of water—this corresponds to the first fifteen days of the lunar month. The water’s number matches the gold’s number, just as the tide’s number aligns with the stars’. If gold and water are insufficient, true water will not arise; this is what is meant by “heaven not responding to stars, earth not responding to the tide.” How then can one fix the weights?\n\nTo truly respond to stars and tide, take the first fifteen days of the lunar month as the standard. From new moon to full, count one and a half days as one part. Two such periods—three days—usher in *geng*. Only then does two parts of true water emerge: heaven responds to stars, earth to the tide. By the fifth day, it becomes three parts—three parts are unusable. By the eighth day, it reaches five parts—five parts are excessive. Neither aligns with the stars or tide.\n\nOnly when two parts of water are paired with two parts of fire does true alignment occur—this is the authentic response to stars and tide, the true sign of *kan* water. When gold first generates water, at precisely two parts, the source is utterly pure, possessing *qi* but no form: this is the *White Tiger’s* first channel. As the tiger exhales its breath, the dragon meets it with two parts of true fire, refining it into the elixir’s foundation.\n\nAs for the gold that generates two parts of water, it must wait until the fifteenth day, when the metal’s essence peaks and the water’s tide arises. This is the “two sevens’ period,” when true lead first descends—this is responding to stars and tide.\n\nSome may ask: *Why must the fire be precisely two parts?*\nAnswer: In one hour’s work, divided into three *fu* and six *hou*, only one *fu* and two *hou* of fire are used. Thus, dragon and tiger remain balanced, devouring and being devoured in turn. At the critical moment, one must wield the sword to subdue the dragon and grasp the cord to tame the tiger. Circulating the *gang* and turning the Dipper, returning to the central palace, the sun and moon conjoin their essences. Refining and tempering them, the true Way is attained.\n\nMy teacher from Wuyi Mountain offers an even more precise and illuminating explanation, which I now detail here.\n\n*Qian* heaven is yang; stars are heaven’s fire essence, yang within yin. *Kun* earth is yin; tides are earth’s water *qi*, yin within yang. Essence is the father of fire, *qi* the mother of water. When *Qian*-father and *Kun*-mother unite, *li* fire and *kan* water are born. Thus it is said: “Heaven responds to stars, earth responds to the tide.” “Responding” denotes the mutual resonance between them.\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* states:\n*“Without stars and moon,\nHow could water be gathered?”*\nFrom this, we know that when heaven’s light illumines earth, it responds with stars; when earth’s *qi* bears heaven, it responds with tides.\n\nThe immortals liken heaven’s stars to the fire within the human heart—fire is one’s nature, and nature belongs to the dragon. If it does not descend, the stars scatter and fire disperses. Thus, one must wield the dragon-slaying sword to subdue it; the sword represents great wisdom. They liken earth’s tides to the water within the human body—water is one’s emotions, and emotions belong to the tiger. If it is not tamed, the tide overflows and water flows unchecked. Thus, one must grasp the tiger-binding cord to subdue it; the cord represents great insight.\n\nGreat skill appears clumsy; great wisdom seems foolish. When insight and wisdom merge into darkness, the wondrous mind arises. To turn the *gang* and wield the Dipper’s handle requires the wondrous mind’s power.\n\nThe *gang* is the Northern Dipper. The Dipper governs life, residing in its handle. Wherever the handle points, life-giving *qi* arises. The human body’s wondrous mind, by moving the Dipper’s handle, can transform killing into life. As the Dipper’s handle revolves, the golden elixir enters within. When the golden elixir enters, the wondrous mind returns to me.\n\nThe wondrous mind is the true body, neither born nor destroyed, its virtue merging with heaven and earth, its brightness uniting with sun and moon—it is the true sun and moon within the human body. To seek the wondrous mind, one must return from the postnatal to the prenatal. First, cause the external sun and moon to exchange their light externally, mastering the firing times and understanding the *fu* and *ke*. Only then can it be attained. Upon its return, the internal sun and moon must exchange their light internally, shining ceaselessly day and night. By harmonizing and nurturing them, one forges a furnace of true sun and moon.\n\nThis is the wondrous secret of the golden elixir’s great Way, the profound mystery of the seven returns and nine refinements. It sweeps away the 3,600 side paths, allowing one to ascend the clouds and roam freely, erasing all karmic dust and worldly filth in a single stroke. Without understanding this great Way, there will never be a day of liberation. Karmic dust and worldly filth will only accumulate—how can one fail to awaken?\n\n**[Liu’s Note]** Reverse the mechanism of *qi*.\n**[Li’s Note]** Skillfully employ the art of theft.\n\nThe rootless tree’s flowers bloom high,\nOcean waves surge as the moon plays with the tide.\nThe Silver River’s path pierces the nine skies,\nThe raft’s shadow spans the void, striking the Dipper’s tip.\nTouching the Weaving Maid’s loom stone,\nTreading the Cowherd’s magpie bridge,\nEntering the immortal court with bold courage,\nStealing the Queen Mother’s peaches from Jasper Pool.\n\n**[Liu’s Commentary]**\nThe primordial great Way encompasses heaven and earth, governs the movement of sun and moon, and transcends all existence. Its flowers bloom so high they resemble the moon in the sky, its light reaching the ocean’s depths. Though ocean waves surge to the heavens, water cannot drown the moon’s light—instead, the moon plays with the tide. This is like a person in the sea of suffering: circumstances cannot harm their true nature but instead refine it through adversity.\n\nAgain, the Silver River’s path is distant, piercing the nine skies, yet humans cannot easily cross it. However, with a celestial raft spanning the void and turning the Dipper’s handle, one can traverse it. In ancient times, Zhang Qian rode such a raft across the Silver River and witnessed the Cowherd and Weaving Maid stars meeting—this serves as proof.",

      "original_text": "以理而论，世间亦有仙槎，亦能渡银河。 世间仙槎为何物？ 金丹大道是也。 金丹大道，在虚空中作事业，能以转乾坤，逆阴阳，夺造化，超凡入圣，是亦仙槎也。 然仙槎之妙，在乎斗梢之运用。 斗梢者，北斗第七星瑶光是也，又名天罡。 天罡所指处吉，所坐处凶，盖以指处有生气存焉。 扭回斗梢刹那之间，阴阳相合，生机萌芽，绝不费力，故曰“模着织女支机石，踏遍牛郎驾鹊桥”。 织女属阴，牛郎属阳，鹊桥为牛女相会之处，摸着机石，踏遍鹊桥，以阴招阳，阳来会阴，阴阳相会，金丹有象。 此种道理，尽在波浪里做出，虚空中施为，所以能入仙曹，胆气豪，窃得瑶池王母桃也。 瑶池在西，王母为老阴，即坤母也。 桃者，丹也，即震之一阳也。 王母桃即坤中孕震之象，丹在西而窃取归东，则为我家所有而丹还矣。 但此还丹之妙，其妙在乎阴阳相会，阴阳相会之妙，尤在乎大海波中，逆运气机，不动不摇耳。 能于大海波中，不动不摇，真是有胆气丈夫，九霄有何不可上？ 银河有何不可渡？ 王母蟠桃有何不可窃乎？ 彼世之习静忘形，仅在寂灭中作事者，焉知有此！ [李解]高，指虚空而言。 海浪滔天者，即紫阳翁所谓风浪粗、产玄珠之时也。 风起浪涌，声震虚空，故曰“滔天”，而一个玄珠，正如团团秋月，现于海上，故曰“月弄潮”也。 逆挽银河，上透九霄，仿佛张骞乘槎，影横空际，气机于此直达矣。 然河槎前行，必先有个指引，方不使水经滥行，不由河道，此斗梢之上，所以为泊系之所也。 这“泊”字下得最妙，人间泊船，乃止宿之意，仙客河槎，则以斗梢为靠，端行直指，势不容泊，其言泊斗梢者，正以不可泊、不得泊，就于斗梢泊之。 随斗运转，行中有止，杀里逢生，犹之英雄豪杰，直傥做事，风利不泊，乃是大结局、大兴会之时，不泊胜于泊，泊犹之不泊．斯其为泊斗梢也。 织女、牛郎，天上阴阳二星，年年七夕相会。 织女属阴，机石比汞，牛郎属阳，鹊桥乃牛女相逢之处，即金汞会合之方。 上言斗梢，此言女牛，是斗为女牛之媒也。 牛郎欲会织女，非斗不能圆成，斗转则牛郎渡河，金与汞合矣。 吕祖云：“进火功夫牛斗危”，泥丸云：“妙在尾箕斗女牛”，同此意也。 摸着机石，则以汞迎铅，踏遍鹊桥，则铅汞一路，从此天缘有分，志气能伸，可以遇仙曹而胆气豪矣。 此何故哉？ 以其盗得瑶池王母桃耳。 悟元以瑶池在西，王母为坤母，桃即坤中孕震之象，丹在西而窃取归东，以成还丹，其注明矣，但“窃”字不及“盗”字现成。 东方盗桃，一也； 坎卦为盗，二也。 东方盗桃，恰往西方取金； 坎卦为盗，恰向水底求铅。 盗之为义，妙也哉！ 十九 [刘言]阴阳搏结。 [李言]化生玄珠。 无根树，花正双，龙虎登坛战一场。 铅投汞，配阴阳，法象玄珠无价偿。 此是家园真种子，返老还童寿命长。 上天堂，极乐方，免得轮回见阎王。 [刘注]金丹乃阴阳二气相激而成象，是花须成双而后有用也。 阴阳者，一龙一虎也，一铅一汞也。 龙为真性，汞为灵知，又为元神，俱属阴； 虎为真情，铅为真知，又为元精，俱属阳。 龙虎战者，性情抟聚也。 铅投汞者，精神凝结也。 性情抟聚，精神凝结，阴阳相配，一气混合，真灵圆明，法身有象，圆陀陀，光灼灼，如一粒玄珠，为无价之宝矣。",
      "translated_text": "In terms of principle, the world also possesses its celestial raft, capable of crossing the Silver River. What, then, is this worldly celestial raft? It is none other than the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir operates within the void, capable of revolving heaven and earth, reversing yin and yang, seizing the workings of creation, and transcending the mundane to enter sagehood—this is the celestial raft. Yet the marvel of the celestial raft lies in the manipulation of the Dipper’s handle. The Dipper’s handle is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, Yaoguang, also called the Celestial Stem. Where the Celestial Stem points is auspicious, where it rests is inauspicious, for where it points, the qi of life resides. In the instant the Dipper’s handle is turned back, yin and yang unite, and the sprouts of life emerge effortlessly—hence the saying: *“Grasp the Weaving Maid’s shuttle stone, tread the Cowherd’s magpie bridge.”* The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the Cowherd to yang; the magpie bridge is where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet. By grasping the shuttle stone and treading the magpie bridge, yin summons yang, and yang comes to meet yin—when yin and yang unite, the Golden Elixir takes form. This principle is enacted within the waves, its workings performed in the void, enabling one to enter the ranks of immortals, with boldness of spirit, and steal the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. The Jasper Pool lies in the west, and the Queen Mother is the ancient yin, the Mother of Earth. The peach is the Elixir, the single yang of the *Zhen* trigram. The Queen Mother’s peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within; the Elixir resides in the west, but when stolen and returned to the east, it becomes one’s own, and the Elixir is restored. Yet the marvel of this restored Elixir lies in the union of yin and yang, and the marvel of their union lies in reversing the qi mechanism amidst the waves of the great sea, unmoving and unshaken. To remain unmoving and unshaken amidst the waves of the great sea is the mark of a man of bold spirit—what heaven among the nine skies cannot be ascended? What Silver River cannot be crossed? What Queen Mother’s peaches cannot be stolen? Those who cultivate stillness and forget form, acting only within quiescence, how could they know of this?\n\n---\n\n*[Li’s Explanation]*\n\"High\" refers to the void. The surging waves of the sea are what Master Ziyang called the time when \"the winds and waves are fierce, and the Mysterious Pearl is born.\" As the wind rises and waves surge, their sound shakes the void—hence \"surging to the heavens.\" Yet the Mysterious Pearl, like a round autumn moon, appears upon the sea—thus \"the moon plays with the tide.\" To reverse the flow of the Silver River and pierce the nine skies is like Zhang Qian riding the raft, its shadow spanning the void, the qi mechanism reaching its apex. Yet for the river raft to advance, there must first be guidance, lest the waters overflow their course and stray from the river’s path—this is why the Dipper’s handle serves as the mooring. The word \"moor\" is most apt: for mortals, mooring a boat means resting for the night, but for the immortal’s river raft, the Dipper’s handle is the anchor. To proceed straight and true, one cannot moor—yet to speak of \"mooring the Dipper’s handle\" is precisely to moor where one cannot, where one must not, mooring upon the Dipper’s handle. Following the Dipper’s revolution, movement contains stillness, death gives way to life—just as heroes and bold men act with unbridled resolve, their sails catching the wind without mooring, for this is the moment of grand resolution and great opportunity. Not mooring surpasses mooring, and mooring is as good as not mooring—such is the meaning of \"mooring the Dipper’s handle.\"\n\nThe Weaving Maid and the Cowherd are the celestial yin and yang stars, meeting once a year on the seventh night of the seventh month. The Weaving Maid belongs to yin, the shuttle stone likened to mercury; the Cowherd belongs to yang, the magpie bridge the place where the Cowherd and Weaving Maid meet, the direction where gold and mercury unite. Above, the Dipper’s handle is mentioned; here, the Cowherd and Weaving Maid—thus the Dipper serves as their matchmaker. Without the Dipper, the Cowherd cannot meet the Weaving Maid; when the Dipper turns, the Cowherd crosses the river, and gold unites with mercury. As Ancestor Lü said: *“The work of advancing fire lies in the peril of the Cowherd and Dipper,”* and Niwan said: *“The marvel lies in the tail, the winnowing basket, the Dipper, the Weaving Maid, and the Cowherd,”*—both express this same idea. To grasp the shuttle stone is to have mercury receive lead; to tread the magpie bridge is to have lead and mercury travel the same path. From this, one’s heavenly fate is secured, and one’s aspirations can be fulfilled—one may encounter the immortal ranks and become bold of spirit. Why is this? Because one has stolen the Queen Mother of the Jasper Pool’s peaches. Wuyuan’s explanation—that the Jasper Pool lies in the west, the Queen Mother is the Mother of Earth, the peach is the image of *Kun* nurturing *Zhen* within, and the Elixir in the west is stolen and returned to the east to form the restored Elixir—is clear, yet the word \"steal\" is not as vivid as \"thieve.\" To thieve the peach from the east is one matter; the *Kan* trigram as thief is another. To thieve the peach from the east is to go to the west to obtain gold; the *Kan* trigram as thief is to seek lead from the depths of water. How marvelous is the meaning of \"thieve\"!\n\n---\n\n*[Liu’s Words]*\nYin and yang wrestle and congeal.\n\n*[Li’s Words]*\nGiving birth to the Mysterious Pearl.\n\nThe Rootless Tree,\nits flowers in full bloom,\nDragon and Tiger mount the altar for battle.\nLead enters mercury,\nyin and yang unite,\nthe image of the Mysterious Pearl is priceless.\nThis is the true seed of one’s homeland,\nrestoring youth and prolonging life.\nAscend to heaven,\nto the Land of Ultimate Bliss,\nand escape the wheel of rebirth to meet King Yama.\n\n*[Liu’s Annotation]*\nThe Golden Elixir is the image formed by the clash of yin and yang—thus the flowers must be in pairs to be of use. Yin and yang are the Dragon and the Tiger, lead and mercury. The Dragon is true nature, mercury is numinous awareness, also called the primordial spirit, both belonging to yin; the Tiger is true emotion, lead is true knowledge, also called the primordial essence, both belonging to yang. The Dragon and Tiger battling is the gathering of nature and emotion. Lead entering mercury is the congealing of spirit and essence. When nature and emotion gather, spirit and essence congeal, yin and yang unite, and the single qi blends—true numinosity becomes perfectly luminous, the Dharma-body takes form, round and resplendent, like a single Mysterious Pearl, a priceless treasure.",

In ancient times, Zhang Qian rode such a raft across the Silver River and witnessed the Cowherd and Weaving Maid stars meeting—this serves as proof.",

That which is cultivated in the moon’s embrace: on the third day, when *geng* emerges, the medicinal substance is fresh and tender. Within this *geng* phase of the moon, one cultivates the golden flower, blending two parts fire with two parts water, stewing in primordial chaos for a moment—only then does the first primordial sprout emerge within the crucible. This is the work of a fleeting instant.\n\nIn that instant, when the first primordial sprout truly appears, the wondrous heart takes charge, immediately reversing the celestial pivot, soaring back across the Milky Way—this is the hand that grasps the clouds, the ladder that ascends them, the gathering of the first primordial sprout. The drinker of wine drinks this first immortal brew, and the primordial transforms into white nectar. The wearer of flowers dons this first immortal blossom, and the primordial returns with vernal yang. Flower is wine, wine is flower; to drink it and wear it is to have wine as one’s good companion and flower as one’s dear friend. The spirit and qi surge in harmony, utterly intoxicated—hence it is said, *\"Drink wine, wear flowers, the spirit soars bright; the immortal elder laughs, drunk as mud.\"*\n\nThe \"knowing heart\" is the heart in accord, the wondrous heart within oneself. Vigilant guarding means observing the firing time with this wondrous heart. Yet guarding entails several aspects, and the furnace fire has two phases: if the firing time is insufficient, one withdraws and supplements with *zhun* and *meng* to protect it, requiring external furnace adjustments; if the firing time is complete, one guards it day and night with contained radiance, needing no external furnace adjustments. When the ten-month count is full and nine years have passed, the true person emerges from the crown of the head.\n\nOtherwise, if the external furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will be insufficient and the elixir will not mature; if the external furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will be excessive and the elixir will surely be harmed. If the inner furnace is removed prematurely when it should not be, the firing time will not be refined and the elixir will lack potency; if the inner furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will stagnate in dullness and the elixir will not emerge. All these are errors in the furnace’s firing time. It is thus hoped that the knowing heart, through meticulous vigilance, will avoid such errors.\n\n\"Flying\" signifies deviation—this should be read in light of the earlier chapter *\"When the Flowers Truly Fly.\"*\n\n[Liu’s Exegesis]\nHarmonizing yin and yang.",

      "translated_text": "[Li’s Exegesis]\nObtaining the medicine and returning the elixir.\nThe rootless tree, its flowers in true yellow,\nis born in the central land of wu and ji.\nThe eastern household’s maiden, the western house’s youth—\nas husband and wife, they enter the bridal chamber.\nThe Yellow Matron urges them to drink the ghee-wine,\neach day growing drunk in a haze of intoxication.\nThis immortal formula, the soul-returning nectar,\nraises the dead and revives the living—it is the King of Medicines.\n\n[Liu’s Annotation]\nYellow is the true color of the central wu and ji. Wu, as yang earth, governs movement; ji, as yin earth, governs stillness. When wu and ji unite at the center, they form the true trust, also called the true intent. When the flower’s hue is true yellow, the true numen has entered the central, correct position. Yet for the true numen to be centered and upright, one’s nature and emotions must be as one. The eastern household’s maiden is the nature of wood; the western house’s youth is the emotion of metal. One nature, one emotion—paired as husband and wife, they enter the secluded bridal chamber. With the Yellow Matron urging them to drink the ghee-wine and harmonizing the firing times, what was not in harmony must harmonize, and once harmonized, it remains so. The ghee-wine is not the dregs of the mundane world, nor is it the tangible substances of essence, fluids, or blood within the body. It is the qi of intermingled yin and yang in harmonious union, coalescing into the true unity of essence, flowing as the true unity of water—fragrant and sweet in flavor. The ancients called it \"jade liquid,\" \"nectar,\" \"sweet dew,\" or \"ghee,\" all terms that describe this single point of harmonious qi. To \"urge drinking\" means to regulate what is not harmonious until it reaches perfect harmony. In the practice of the Dao, when yin and yang attain perfect harmony, one remains constantly responsive yet still. From afar, one observes phenomena, yet phenomena are no longer phenomena; up close, one observes the body, yet the body is no longer the body; inwardly, one observes the heart, yet the heart is no longer the heart. Unknowing and unperceiving, one follows the decree of the Emperor. Daily, one drinks the ghee-wine and enters the realm of intoxication. This intoxicated delight is the immortal’s formula, the soul-returning nectar—able to raise the dead, able to revive the living. It is the great King of Medicines. \"Central,\" \"wu and ji,\" and \"Yellow Matron\" are all alternate names for the true trust. In terms of yin-yang harmony, it is called \"central\"; in terms of yin-yang movement, it is called \"wu and ji\"; in terms of yin-yang harmonization, it is called \"Yellow Matron\"; in terms of activity, it is called \"true trust\"; in terms of stillness and stability, it is called \"true intent.\" Thus, one thing has many names, but in sum, it is merely the one true trust. Recognizing this trust, one must apply solid effort upon it. First, seek emotion through nature; then, return emotion to nature; then, harmonize nature and emotion; then, merge nature and emotion into oneness, forming a single true numinous treasure. From beginning to end, nothing succeeds without this one trust—how great is the function of trust! When reduced to its essence, the centered and upright true numen is the union of nature and emotion. When nature and emotion unite, the true trust resides within. When the true trust manifests, nature and emotion naturally do not separate, and the true numen is naturally centered and upright. These three depend on and yet give rise to one another.\n\n[Li’s Explanation]\nYellow is the true color, the correct awakening of the Buddhist school, the correct qi of the Confucian and Daoist traditions. In the Buddhist canon, it is called \"yellow flowers\"; in the immortal classics, it is called \"yellow sprouts.\" Yet there are two kinds of yellow sprouts: one is the new medicine of the third day, the other is the great medicine of the fifteenth day. As *Awakening to Reality* states: \"Where yellow sprouts arise, kan and li conjoin\"—this refers to the new medicine of the third day. Where yellow sprouts arise is where kan and li should unite to plant the second yellow sprout. *Awakening to Reality* says: \"Plant the yellow sprout, and it gradually grows\"—this is the second yellow sprout, the great medicine of the fifteenth day. The growth of the yellow sprout truly arises from the union of kan and li. This union of kan and li occurs in the central land of wu and ji. The center is where essence and qi coalesce; the land of wu and ji is where movement and stillness harmonize. Once harmonized and coalesced, in an instant, the yellow sprout is born from within—hence it is said, \"born in the central land of wu and ji.\" This yellow sprout has many names; in this chapter, it is the western house’s youth. The western house’s youth is the qi of metal; the eastern household’s maiden is the essence of mercury. Gathering the qi of metal to subdue the essence of mercury—this is the Dao of returning metal and mercury, the pairing of husband and wife entering the bridal chamber. Once in the bridal chamber, the Yellow Matron must guard them. The Yellow Matron is the \"knowing heart\" mentioned in the previous chapter. If the couple fears discord, their spirit, intent, and qi will struggle to enter the realm of harmony, and the elixir will not form. Thus, the Yellow Matron must attend to them, urging them to drink the ghee. The ghee is the essence of external nurturing warmth, the qi of internal harmonious union. The Yellow Matron is the intimate confidant; the firing times in the furnace will naturally not err. Between dawn and dusk, she urges them to drink frequently, each day growing drunk in a haze—truly a joyous affair. This wine is not mundane wine but the wine brewed by the immortal’s formula, called the soul-returning nectar. It can raise the dead and revive the living; neither minor nor external medicines can compare. It is the King of Medicines. This chapter describes the work of the fourth firing time after seeking lead in the second firing time. Seeking lead is an external affair: on the third day, when the moon emerges in geng, one applies effort. This is called \"pairing water with fire,\" \"the dragon approaching the tiger,\" \"yin meeting yang,\" \"li uniting with kan,\" \"nature harmonizing with emotion,\" \"mercury investing lead,\" \"the maiden marrying the man\"—all methods of using the postnatal to generate the prenatal. In sum, it is the union of essence and qi, an external medicine. Its work lies externally, requiring only one talisman and two firing times to establish the foundation of the elixir.",
      "overlap_context": "e firing time will not be refined and the elixir will lack potency; if the inner furnace is not removed when it should be, the firing time will stagnate in dullness and the elixir will not emerge. All these are errors in the furnace’s firing time. It is thus hoped that the knowing heart, through meticulous vigilance, will avoid such errors.\n\n\"Flying\" signifies deviation—this should be read in light of the earlier chapter *\"When the Flowers Truly Fly.\"*\n\n[Liu’s Exegesis]\nHarmonizing yin and yang.",

Guanyin.\nGuanyin’s stillness governs with strict restraint,\nPreventing the Red Child from seizing power—\nThen sweet dew arises.\nAs for the *you* gate,\nIt is wrapped in the Yellow Skirt,\nPreventing the primal pearl from spilling—\nThen the white fluid congeals.\nSuch is the wondrous use of ice-bathing.\n\nThe Yellow Court is the center.\nThe Valley Spirit is emptiness and numinosity.\nAbiding in the center to nurture emptiness and numinosity,\nThe Dharma-body manifests its image—\nA man resembling a woman with child,\nLaughable yet endearing indeed.\n\n**Twenty-Three**\n*[Liu’s words:]*\nTrue emptiness, Dharma-form.\n*[Li’s words:]*\nPerfect penetration, self-so freedom.\n\nThe rootless tree,\nIts blossoms now crimson—\nPluck all the red

never falling into emptiness.\nNamed Perfect Penetration, called the Great Hero,\nNine generations ascend beyond the nine heavens.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir takes as its destination\nThe transcendence of all phenomena in soundlessness and scentlessness—\nHow could blossoms possess crimson hue?\nIf even the slightest trace of color remains,\nThe postcelestial qi and temperament are not yet fully transformed,\nAnd the Great Dao remains unaccomplished.\nThe ancient immortals said:\n“Not a shred of yin qi may remain if one is to become immortal.”\nFor if a shred of yin qi remains,\nA shred of yang qi is incomplete,\nAnd the true spirit may still suffer damage—\nThis cannot be called the Great Elixir of the sevenfold return and ninefold restoration.\nThe cultivator must pluck all the red blossoms,\nEradicating the adventitious dust-roots accumulated since beginningless kalpas,\nReturning to the state where all things are empty,\nRestoring the soundless, scentless visage prior to parents’ birth.\nYet this “emptiness” does not mean the lifeless stillness of wood or stone.\nThere is a Dao of borrowing the provisional to perfect the real,\nAnd using the real to transform the provisional—\nHence: “Emptiness is form, form is emptiness;\nDiscern true emptiness within form.”\nTo be wholly without mind is to cling to emptiness;\nTo harbor even the slightest mind is to cling to form.\n“Emptiness is form” means it is not empty;\n“Form is emptiness” means it is not form.\nNeither empty nor formed, yet both empty and formed—\nThis is true emptiness abiding within form.\n“When true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes,\nYet the Dharma-form endures, never falling into emptiness”:\nTrue emptiness, once realized, settles all matters.\nOriginally without form,\nYet since form vanishes, the Dharma-form remains;\nAnd since the Dharma-form remains, it cannot fall into emptiness.\nBecause it is true emptiness, the Dharma-form exists;\nBecause the Dharma-form exists, there is no form—\nNo form, yet Dharma-form abiding:\nThus emptiness is true, and truth is emptiness.\nWhen cultivation reaches the point where true emptiness bears the Dharma-form,\nAnd the Dharma-form preserves true emptiness,\nThe wondrous existence of the One Spirit,\nPerfectly penetrating the Dharma-realm,\nBecomes an indestructible vajra-body—\nWater and fire cannot assail it,\nBlades and weapons cannot harm it,\nTigers and rhinoceroses cannot wound it—\nAnd it is called the Great Hero.\nNot only does one ascend to the ranks of immortals,\nBut even nine generations of ancestors rise to the heavens,\nBecoming deities together.\nIn former times, when Śākyamuni Buddha cultivated the sixteen-foot golden body,\nAnd his Dharma-form dwelled in the Hall of the Great Hero,\nIt was this very Dao.\n\n*[Li’s explanation:]*\nRed is the symbolic form of the Great Medicine.\nThe immortal master’s *Daoist Sentiments Song* and *The Rootless Tree*\nAre both essential works—\nFrom them, this may be understood.\nThe *Daoist Sentiments Song* says:\n“Of all phenomena, none are of the same kind;\nA single red radiance is the utmost truth.”\nWhen red radiance appears,\nIts blossoms are crimson;\nWhen the red blossoms are in hand, the true medicine is obtained.\nApart from these red blossoms, no medicine can be gathered.\nOnce the work of gentle nurturing is complete,\nFurnace and crucible are entirely set aside—\nAll those blossoming trees are no longer discussed.\nThus: “Pluck all the red blossoms, and the whole tree is empty.”\nOnce the blossoms are empty, my Dao is attained;\nOnce my Dao is attained, emptiness is no longer empty.\nSince emptiness is no longer empty, emptiness is form;\nForm is not substantial form—it is the form of the Dharma.\nDiscern that true emptiness is not empty,\nAnd true emptiness abides within form.\nThis “form” is not the form of form,\nBut the form of the Dharma.\nWhen true emptiness is fully realized, form vanishes entirely;\nWhen form vanishes entirely, the Dharma-form endures forever.\nThe enduring Dharma-form is true emptiness not empty.\n“Perfect penetration” means merit and practice are complete,\nAll dharmas are penetrated,\nAnd the substance and function of true emptiness are perfected.\nOnce called Perfect Penetration, one must be called the Great Hero;\nOnce called the Great Hero, one must become the patriarch of immortals—\nHow could nine generations of ancestors not ascend,\nRising together beyond the nine heavens?\n\n**Twenty-Four**\n*[Liu’s words:]*\nReturn to the formless.\n*[Li’s words:]*\nAttain the rank of the Three Purities.\n\nThe rootless tree,\nIts blossoms now formless—\nWithout appearance or shape, hard to depict.\nNameless, yet responsive to call,\nSeized and placed within the alchemical furnace.\nIgnite the Samādhi fire of the microcosmic orbit,\nTemper true emptiness to return to the Great Void.\nVisit the immortal capital,\nReceive the celestial tally—\nOnly then is one a true man, a great hero.\n\n*[Liu’s commentary:]*\nThe treasure of the primordial true spirit\nIs fundamentally empty,\nA single qi harmoniously blended—\nHow could

      "translated_text": "The Dao returns to the Great Void, where emptiness itself is empty—nothing remains but the One True. There is no other thing.\n\nThe Three Fields are not the common alchemical terms for *qi*-sea, Crimson Palace, or Muddy Pellet; rather, they are the Elixir Fields where the Three Treasures—essence, *qi*, and spirit—converge. This is called the Gate of Primordial Transformation, also known as the Primordial Pass, the Central Yellow Court, the Alchemical Furnace, the Altar of the Great One, or the Gate of Wuji. In sum, it is the Cavern of Emptiness.\n\nThe treasure of the primordial true spirit governs the Three Substances—essence, *qi*, and spirit. When the true spirit is restored, the Three Substances are likewise restored. They transform of themselves, harmoniously blending in undifferentiated unity. First, from nonbeing they create being; then, from being they return to nonbeing. The refinement of true emptiness is precisely the marvel of transforming being into nonbeing. When being is thus transformed into nonbeing, both form and spirit attain perfection, merging with the Great Void in oneness. With merit and practice complete, one ascends to the Immortal Capital to receive the celestial mandate, becoming a Perfected One of the Ten Poles and the Great Primal Chaos—a true man whose great work is fulfilled.\n\n*In Praise:*\nRevealing the hidden depths of Laozi and Zhuangzi,\nContinuing the heart-transmission of Zhong and Lü.\nUnveiling the wondrous principle of the primordial,\nCleaving open the tangled paths of empty suspension.\nThe crucible’s right and wrong distinctly judged,\nThe medicine’s truth and falsehood plainly seen.\nEmptiness and form blend into a single *qi*,\nHard and soft match as two strings in harmony.\nAh!\nThe alchemical method’s beginning and end fully disclosed,\nThe fire-tally’s advance and retreat wholly inscribed.\nTwenty-four verses of the immortal’s formula—\nWhoever grasps them becomes a deathless immortal.\n\n*[Li’s Commentary:]*\nThe word \"nonbeing\" carries forward the meaning of \"emptiness\" from the previous chapter, deepening it to conclude the twenty-four verses. To refine the elixir to the point of emptiness is already perfect, yet if one clings to the notion of true emptiness, the notion of dharmic form remains. Emptiness still falls short of nonbeing. As Lord Lao said: *\"Observe emptiness as empty; emptiness itself is empty. What is emptied is already nothing; even nothingness is nothing. Abiding in utter stillness.\"* Only this is the great liberation, the great awakening, the great purity, the great perfect enlightenment. Why? Because the wondrous being of utter stillness appears as emptiness, and emptiness as nonbeing—beyond all form, beyond depiction or illustration. Precisely because it is formless and imageless, it is difficult to depict or draw; it simply abides in utter stillness.\n\nBefore this, in gathering the primordial, there were those named after metals—gold for essence, yellow for the sprout, white for the primordial. But this utterly still true reality has no name or surname. Though nameless, it responds to every call, like an echo in an empty valley, answer following answer. Question it with words, and it receives the command as if facing you—this is the utmost subtlety in the world. Still and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated—this is the utmost spirit in the world. Why? Because this utterly still true reality is hidden within nonbeing.\n\nThe principles of sages, worthies, immortals, and buddhas penetrate the workings of creation. Within nonbeing, being is concealed. At this stage, the uncanny and wondrous manifest—such as Leng Qijing, Zhang Jinghua, and Immortal Zhou Dian. Our Master Sanfeng, embodying the Dao, must seize nonbeing with nonbeing and enter the central realm of emptiness. Through great creation and transformation, within the furnace he circulates the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere, refining and tempering until the dharmakāya of emptiness returns to the Great Nonbeing.\n\nThe Great Nonbeing is the realm of the sagely perfected—such as the Jade Purity’s Primal Chaos Great Heaven or the High Purity’s Crimson Primal Nonbeing Great Heaven. Those who refine the immortal Dao receive only the ranks of the Great Purity. But those who return to the Great Nonbeing first pay homage to the Dao and its Power, then to the Jade Emperor, and finally to the Primordial Beginning, attaining the fruit of the Three Purities.\n\nThe word \"return\" signifies that all foolish men and women are originally beings of the Three Purities. Yet due to karmic delusion, they descend age after age, remaining foolish men and women, unable to regain the realm of the sagely perfected. If they turn their hearts toward goodness, seek the Dao, and find a teacher—progressing from foundation-laying and self-cultivation through the seven reversals and nine returns, refining to emptiness and then to nonbeing, and from nonbeing returning to the Great Nonbeing—they once again become guests of the Three Purities.\n\nYet refining true emptiness requires the true fire of Samādhi around the celestial sphere. The celestial sphere does not refer to the river chariot but to movement within the heavens, the subtle workings in the void, the profound and mysterious transformations of the Dao’s natural law. Samādhi does not refer to yang fire but to the union of heaven-one and earth-two as three. Within heaven and earth, I establish the crucible and furnace. Spirit and *qi* merge in obscurity—this is the fire of immortal refinement, the celestial primordial elixir.\n\nWith merit complete and practice fulfilled, one ascends to the Three Heavens, visits the Immortal Capital, receives the celestial mandate, and may be enfeoffed as a Perfected Lord, an Imperial Lord, a Heavenly Venerable, or appointed as a master of the Five Peaks, the sacred mountains, the grotto-heavens, or the blessed lands to select immortals. Only then is one a true man, the greatest of men—divine to the utmost!\n\n*In Praise:*\nScattering flower-rain across the sky,\nSpreading golden earth below.\nHand clapping fish-drum and clappers,\nMouth singing the immortal hymns of the Upper Grotto.\nDelivering the four continents,\nEternally embodying the Dao’s sentiment.\nAh!\nWherever one awakens to the true spirit,\nFirst hold fast to our school’s essential intent.\nThe mountain man proclaims the true formula by the book,\nBroadly opening the nondual gate to deliver the world.\n\n*[Original Notes:]*\nWu Yuan said: \"I do not know what tune this is.\"\nHanxu said: \"Those who sing *Daoist sentiment* are called *pulling dark clouds*.\"\nIn the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, \"subtle\" is written as \"precarious,\" which also conveys the sense of decline.\nIn the *Wuyuan* annotated edition, \"green\" is written as \"pure,\" yet \"green\" signifies the freshness of new growth, akin to purity untouched by defilement.\n\"Wall-top\" is written as \"jade flower,\" and \"jade flower\" as \"wall-top\"—I have seen both versions.",

      "translated_text": "**Daoist Sentiment Poems (Twenty-Four)**\n\nMen say it is good to be human,\nI say being human is endless toil.\nEven if wealth and rank mean nothing to me,\nMust I still yearn day and night for the immortal isles?\n\nAs for me,\nHánxū is a Daoist.\nBorn into this world uncommon,\nYet my rebirth was amiss.\nFrom childhood, I mumbled a few words,\nAnd in adulthood, I was tangled in vines,\nDreaming of fame that would echo through ages,\nOr of soaring as an immortal on earth—\nAll these fancies left me with nothing achieved.\nFortune’s five phases align,\nAnd by grace, I still have a thatched hut,\nThree fellow Daoists,\nRoaming carefree, high above the mortal dust.\nLaughing and smiling,\nWe linger among streams and stones.\nLate autumn, early winter,\nWith no affairs in the mountains,\nWe brew a pot of chrysanthemum wine,\nAdmire the early plum blossoms,\nAnd softly chant Daoist poems.\n\nAlas, since descending into this world,\nI recall my past life as a cold scholar,\nLightly drifting in a boat between Húnán and Húběi.\nWhy did I vow to seek the Western Paradise?\nWandering through clouds, waters, mist, and mountains.\n\nAnd pity those born into this world,\nWho enter the womb and lodge their souls,\nEach layer of parents bestowing kindness.\nTheir faces resemble their fathers and mothers,\nNurtured with warmth and tender words.\nBorn as human—this is fortunate,\nBut one must know to cherish it.\nAfter ten thousand kalpas and a thousand rebirths to gain a human form,\nOne must understand the causes sown in the great kalpa.\n\nThe Pure Yang Ancestor’s compassion is boundless,\nUrging us to value this body before us.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao—\nNot a speck of mundane thought may arise.\nHear my recitation:\nSpring water is muddy when it leaves the mountain, clear within it;\nI regret my past journey into distant lands.\nSuddenly seeing so much splendor,\nOnly then do I realize how hard it is to remain unmoved by circumstances.\n\nThose who cultivate the Dao—\nWhere does the Dao-heart arise?\nThe melody of wind and springs winds through ten thousand pines,\nYet it cannot compare to the ten-mile expanse of a tranquil lake.\nThe moon hangs at the heart of the sky, the cold rests in the water,\nSuddenly cooling the mind’s earth.\n\nCultivators of the Dao—\nThe superior begin from nothing to create being.\nMy family’s elixir method comes from Yíngzhōu,\nStarting with emptiness and nothingness.\nFear not the absence of signs,\nFor one must seek the root in nothingness.\n\nFirst, refine essence into qi.\nOn the yīn qiāo vessel, qi drifts hazily,\nSo much true essence lies within.\nGather it into emptiness and refine it into qi—\nA path opens to Pénglái’s distant shores.\n\nSecond, refine qi into spirit.\nSpirit and qi merge into the boundless,\nSuddenly hearing the true scripture chanted in the void.\nThe five directions, the five qi swirl around,\nAnnouncing the birth of the spirit from the primordial azure.\n\nThird, refine spirit to complete nature.\nThe immortal qi must be sought in stillness,\nFew on the red-dust path understand.\nSitting in the central courtyard for three months of fragrance,\nA golden sprout grows an inch deep.\n\nThose who leave the household—\nAfter refining essence to generate qi,\nSome effects will appear.\nDaily, guide the qi to the mud-pill palace,\nSweet nectar gradually fills the tip of the tongue.\nIrrigating the three fields, nourishing the hundred vessels,\nNaturally, essence grows and the valley spirit is at peace.\n\nWhen sweet nectar fills the mouth each day,\nThe immortal heart arises.\nOn a jade isle, dwelling in seclusion,\nThe Pure Yang Ancestor sits high in a painted pavilion.\nSweeping the floor, burning incense—utterly idle,\nOnly the flower studio’s leisure remains.\n\nWith the immortal heart comes stillness of mind.\nDeep in misty mountains, one lingers.\nFrom this, literary thoughts turn to elixir refinement.\nSleeves rolled with white clouds, returning to the cave abode,\nHead bowed, eyes closed, seated on the rush mat.\n\nWith stillness of mind comes the true heart.\nAll that is known and perceived is false;\nOnly the unknown and unperceived give birth to truth.\nA single somersault shatters the primordial chaos,\nAnd one sets out to become a Daoist in the Eastern Realm.\n\nWhen the true heart appears, the true seed is ever-present.\nGold meets wood, mercury lingers,\nThe infant and the maiden meet—how joyous!\nLast night, the Lady of the Cinnabar Terrace sent a sweet dream,\nAnd a red pill was conceived.\n\nWhy is it called \"from being to non-being\"?\nCongeal the jade liquid into elixir wealth,\nPlace it in the Kūn palace—truly still.\nSuddenly, a single yang rises from the earth,\nThe elixir’s resources return to me without guesswork.\n\nWhy is it called \"from non-being to being\"?\nTrue lead emerges from the great void,\nPlanted in the Lí palace, born in the Kǎn palace.\nI see the golden sprout burst forth in luxuriance,\nWhile others speak of white snow filling the emptiness.\n\nWhy is it called \"joining for long life\"?\nMercury’s nature is light and fond of flight,\nLead’s essence is heavy and never fails to consume.\nIn refining the elixir, if passion returns to nature,\nOne will surely ride a green phoenix into the Tàiwēi realm.\n\nWhy is it called \"life within killing\"?\nLead meets mercury in distress, yet bestows grace within harm,\nMercury, bound by lead, is reborn from death.\nIf the wondrous treasure lacks restraint,\nThe work of immortality will not be perfected.\n\nHow does one meet the Green Maiden and give birth to the sacred embryo?\nThe Green Maiden is young and adept at cultivation,\nNot a solitary yīn—her body cannot generate life.\nAfter meeting in the bridal chamber,\nThey share a bed for ten months to bear the embryo.\n\nHow does one transfer the cauldron and shift the embryo, so the child begets grandchildren?\nThe Great Dao ascends step by step,\nOnce the returned elixir is achieved, one meets the immortals.\nYear by year, the fire’s timing adds to the household,\nGazing toward Pénglái, the spirit soars.\n\nHear the mountain man speak of the wondrous principles of nurturing life—\nThere is much joy in them.\nI wonder, in ordinary times, which masters and immortals did you admire?\nThe Pure Yang Recluse, old Chén Tuán,\nA carefree immortal of the Five Dynasties.\nThe joy of the clapper and fishing rod beyond the world,\nUnmoved by chaos, naturally at peace.\n\nAnd which immortal master did you follow?\nThe Great Yuan’s remnant elder, known as Sānfēng,\nWho vanished at the end of the Yuán dynasty.\nOnly when the Chéngpíng era arrived did he reappear,\nDelighting in drifting clouds and flowing waters among lofty pines.\n\nAs for me, the carefree Hánxū of the Daoist sentiment poems,\nThese twenty-four chapters express it all.\nIn Chángyǐ Mountain, there is nothing else—\nA single fish-drum, a single lyric.\nTo restrain the heart is the method; Daoist sentiments dispel cares.\n\nIf you wish to ascend to the Great Luó Heaven,\nYou must refine your heart.",

      "translated_text": "Abandon thoughts of fame and fortune, sever ties to profit and desire.\nEven if gossamer threads of calculation arise, fierce fire burns them away to reveal the celestial nature.\nOne end rises, one end severs—\nOnly subtraction is seen, no addition.\nFear not the ten thousand restless \"heart-monkeys,\" nor the thousand galloping \"mind-horses.\"\nPractice internal work, breathe into the dantian.\nGuard the true breath, and purity comes naturally.\nPlunge into profound darkness to draw forth auspicious mist.\nIt tingles my Crimson Palace, intoxicates my limbs with languid softness.\nThis is my true method for taming dragons, my technique for slaying serpents.\nPassed down everywhere among mortals, the celestial mechanism is not sold for silver.\nWealthy disciples present gifts in homage; impoverished disciples follow fate as it comes.\nThey remain unfeigned, I remain incorrupt—\nNow, after three years of digging the well, I seek to establish some karmic merit.\nWho could know the perversity of destiny, the hardship of the times?\nFamily fortunes decline, heroic spirit wanes, and the elixir furnace is utterly neglected.\nYet should the winds of fortune shift one day, I’ll cast off all and roam carefree to the immortal isles.\n\n**The Heart-Mind Chapter**\nIts heart-mind luminous, its functions manifold.\nIts spirit profound, its substance serene and steadfast (I act not, yet qi naturally coalesces).\nThus the ancients directly grasped the \"non-spiritual spirit\" as the true spirit.\n\n**Cultivating the Heart-Mind**\nSweeping away resentment and desire is no hardship;\nWhen the heart-mind is at peace, the body too is at peace.\nThe moon casts its clear light upon still waters,\nThe wind carries coolness around the winding balustrade.\nBuddhist scriptures penetrated, vexations vanish;\nDaoist teachings attained, a steadfast vision arises.\nEver restrain the heart-mind within the chamber of the chest,\nWalking alone, sitting alone, pacing alone.\n\n**Three Poems on Emptiness**\nPracticing is easy, attaining is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir is made.\nIf the world seeks a place to stabilize the tripod,\nWithin this realm, the expanse surpasses the heavens.\n\nLoving is easy, delighting is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir is made.\nIf the world seeks where the life-nourishing medicine grows,\nWithin the gourd, the immortals’ altar already stands.\n\nAttaining is easy, preserving is hard—\nApart from emptiness, no elixir coalesces.\nIf the world seeks where to establish destiny,\nFrom beginning to end, it is all one undivided whole.\n\n**Cultivating the Elixir**\nMassage and daoyin techniques,\nEasy to encounter, hard to perfect.\nThe Great Dao of the Golden Elixir,\nHard to encounter, easy to practice.\nPracticing is not without difficulty,\nYet it can be aligned with longevity.\nModeled on heaven and earth,\nTempered in nature and emotion.\nNature and emotion interact,\nEchoing through the empty valley.\nManifestations transform and change,\nThe work lies in stillness and clarity.\nHeart-mind clear, qi clear—\nBeneath the earth, thunder rumbles.\nThunder shakes heaven and earth,\nThe two phases unite in true essence.\nDragon and tiger wage a great battle,\nIn the wild, supreme peace is established.\nThe three yang open the myriad apertures,\nGathering medicine into the central camp.\nFrom this, for ten months,\nThe gentle fire nurtures the fetal immortal.\nSplitting open the mud-pill peak,\nCarefree, one ascends to the Jade Capital.\n\n**Discoursing on the Art of Immortality**\nOf old, there were gods who did not die,\nBut no bodies that did not die.\nThose whose spirit attains non-death\nAre precisely those who attain immortality.\nWhen mortals die, their spirit perishes;\nWhen immortals die, their spirit endures.\nThe gulf between endurance and perishing spans heaven and earth,\nImmortals and mortals are not of the same rank.\nIn the world, centenarians\nMay endure many springs.\nYet as old age approaches,\nTheir true nature grows dim and lost.\nBewildered by avarice and desire,\nTheir will and vitality fade into stupor.\nBefore death, the body is already in chaos;\nBefore rebirth, past causes are obscured.\nNot waiting for the next life,\nThey sink into ruin before their very eyes.\nWho can embrace this wondrous art?\nDwelling in leisure, refining the primordial spirit.\nEven if one cannot escape death,\nThe numinous nature alone transcends the dust,\nRoaming carefree between heaven and earth,\nPlaying the flute in the wake of Lü Dongbin.\n\n**Lamenting the Pass of Sensual Desire**\nThrough the ages, the greatest fools\nLove beauty as they love flowers.\nThrough the ages, the most foolish\nAre insatiable in their greed.\nIndulgence in desire harms the essence,\nLike a violent gale stripping the forest of its blossoms.\nThe *Guo Feng* warns against sensuality,\nYet still, there is a touch of elegance.\nThe dissolute revel in desire,\nTheir kind no better than swine.\nThose who cultivate both sensuality and the Dao\nMeet ruin and lamentable ends.\nBetter to take a fair maiden,\nSever desire, and refine cinnabar.\nHow wondrous was Zhang Guolao,\nWho tended garden melons with his wife.\nHow illusory was Yi Yongchang,\nWho sang of clouds and mist with his spouse.\nBoth sages were enamored of beauty,\nYet in the world beyond, their love was rare.\nThe perfected have no lustful thoughts,\nThe root of desire is severed, never to sprout again.\nI admire the immortals of old,\nWhose celestial consorts were their true partners.\n\n**Those Who Cultivate the Dao Should Sever Desire**\nThe Great Elixir employs the furnace and cauldron,\nMetaphors for refining and nurturing the medicine.\nThe vulgar, failing to understand, heap scorn and slander—\nThis is the fault of clinging to literal words.\nIn jest, I mimic their phrasing\nTo clarify the meaning for the rigidly conventional.\n\nFourteen ounces of refined gold\nCan forge the immortal’s crucible.\nTake the lead within *gui*,\nTo mend the losses within my body.\nCrimson silk nurtures the true nature,\nThe alchemical chamber holds fine vessels.\nOnce the work is complete, all are discarded,\nSelecting companions for shared cultivation.\n\nThere was a young man from the eastern household,\nIn the prime of his years, keen and perceptive.\nKan and Li inverted and overturned,\nNature and emotion mutually affirmed.\nThese are my numinous parents,\nTogether entering the grotto-heaven to seclude themselves.\nWhen the Dao is perfected, a family of immortals,\nThe Great Luo will come to welcome them.\n\n**Matching the Rhymes of Master Ma Bicheng’s \"Declining Health in Prosperity\"**\nThe year of the Boar ends, the Rat begins,\nWinter’s start already reveals spring.\nThe first yang returns to its origin,\nMyriad things gradually contain the new.\nSnow-covered earth, rivers and mountains gleam,\nFrost-laden sky, the atmosphere is true.\nIn the cold garden, fine fruits ripen,\nTangerine wine reveals the spirit’s fullness.\n\n**Awakening at Dawn**\nTen thousand matters fail to go as wished,\nReturning, I chant poetry again.\nThis body should be singularly good,\nMy Dao is not entirely mistaken.\nSpring arrives swiftly, swallows come early,\nThe night is cold, the cock crows late.\nThe morning star is as large as a bowl,\nFew know the celestial signs.\n\n**After the Double Ninth, Inviting Disciples to Roam the Muyi Hermitage**\nEmptiness congeals into emerald, following the azure vastness,\nClapping hands, singing as we ascend.\nI wish all beings to ascend the realm of longevity,\nWhere the immortal spring is truly fragrant for the elderly.\n\n**Double Ninth at the Yang Zheng Residence**\nOn the Double Ninth, the sky drizzles like silk,\nIn the Hall of Nurturing Integrity, the wine cup is raised.",
